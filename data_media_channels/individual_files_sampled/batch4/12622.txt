on Monday actor Chris Hemsworth better known as Thor explained the role of James Bond should be redone this time with Charlize Theron playing the part sir on is the star of the soon-to-be-released atomic blonde a bond Jason Bourne female knockoff she embodies every ounce of strength and nobility and dignity and integrity the character should have Hemsworth explained she's smart as hell she's physically able you know watching her in those fight teams and Snow White and the Huntsman doing it in high heels by the whale an eight-foot-long gown was even more impressive and I just think why not it's time this is to put it mildly the stupidest crap I have ever heard but it is not rare to hear Hollywood Knights virtue signaling by talking about their ideal bond Ian McKellen said years ago he'd like a gay bond but bond and bond he has a character he's an ultra straight womanizer from filling teenage boy fantasies that is the entire point of the character it just doesn't work the same way with a woman bond is a bad boy because he can seduce any woman no matter how unavailable or beautiful making bond a woman changes that calculus utterly because virtually any mildly attractive woman can do the same with virtually any man it is not a challenge for Charlize Theron to get a man in bed as Amy Schumer has said I'm 160 pounds and I can catch a bleep whenever I want she is scientifically accurate as David Schmidt PhD writes in Psychology Today quote over the last few decades almost all research studies have found that men are much more Eagle Eagle for casual sex than women are Oliver and Hyde 1993 Peterson in hi 2010 this is especially true when it comes to desires for short-term mating with many different sexual partners and it's even more true for wanting to have sex with complete and total strangers in a classic social experiment from the 1980s Clark and Hatfield put the idea of sex differences in consenting to sex with strangers to a real-life test they had experimental Confederates approach college students around various campuses and asked quote I've been noticing you around campus I find you to be very attractive would you like to go to bed to meet with me with me tonight around seventy five percent of men agreed to have sex with a complete stranger whereas zero women zero percent agreed in terms of effect size this is one of the largest sex differences ever discovered in Psychological Science okay folks this is not sexism it is science furthermore there is always going to be a necessary suspension of disbelief while watching Charlize Theron who might be 120 pounds soaking wet beat up guys twice your size watching Daniel Craig who's probably and seventy do the same isn't quite the same thing there are plenty of great female action parts Tehran might well play one anatomic blonde but hijacking classic characters and having them switch genders and or sexuality destroys the characters there's a decent case for Idris Elba's bond color doesn't change the map for bonds character there is no case further on or any other woman to be James Bond just stop it you're being an idiot I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so I mean just do anything things can't get any stupider they get stupid or really like this it's funny what what dragon devil well this sort of stuff drives me totally up a law like the idea you're just going to turn James Bond into woman nothing changes because men and women are different stupid people stupid stupid leftist men and women are totally different before we get to all of the breakdown from from Trump care and the fallout and who's to blame and is Trump kind of pay and price or is Congress going to play a price we'll talk about all of those things plus and want to get to Jake Tapper taking on Linda Sarsour which is really quite wonderful we'll get to all of those things and I'll give you the update by the way on a prospective intern that we will be interviewing

mock you Jonathan in any case they in any case I met it will give you the quick update on unfeminist son intern because that was making some news last night so as you recall last Friday I talked about this lady named Jodi Allard Jodi Allard wrote a piece in The Washington Post and then she wrote a follow-up piece at some no-name website where she talked about how her sons were potential rapists because they had the penis and that means that if you have such a thing this means the you are potential rapists according to Jodi Ehlert so I said that I would offer her son an internship to help him escape the clutches of evil mom and last night an independent journalist named up artist Ella who used to work over at Daily wire she's a story about the check she contacted Jodi Allard son and found out that he was interested in the in national internship with us and so he sends her resume to her she forwarded on to us last night Jodi Allard obviously out of Lube tweeted at me and said is this internship stunt just two stunts we haven't heard anything from you to which I replied well obviously you don't talk to your son who you call a prospective rapist all that much because he sent us a resume and I have it right here on my desk so hopefully we'll be talking to to Jared which is the name of her son sometime in the next 24-48 hours we're seeing we can work out that phone call right now we'd love to work something out with him obviously the skill set has to match but if it is even a remote match we'll find some way to work with him because anything to to get some money so he can escape that house because horrifying horrifying okay so that is the ASF particular story in other news the the Trump carrot bill went down yesterday it went down because Mike Lee and Jerry Moran from Kansas and the enthusing Collins from Maine and Rand Paul all said they were not going to vote for it and that means that a bunch of people on the right are now blaming these folks for the collapse now it's fair to blame Susan Collins because Susan Collins is never going to vote for any sort of Obamacare appeal she likes Obamacare it is not fair to blame Mike Lee or Rand Paul Rand Paul that there's been suggestion that Rand Paul never votes for things because that's just a shtick even that is quasi fair but it is not fair to blame Mike Lee the reason that it is not fair to blame Mike Lee is because there are a bunch of people today who are saying that Michael Lee preserved Obamacare britt hume says this you hewitt says this that the obamacare has been preserved by Mike Lee and Rand Paul this is a bunch of crap Obamacare was preserved by the bill itself the bill itself kept all of the regulations under Obamacare it added some subsidies and got rid of some of the taxes and a restructured Medicaid now if the Republicans had come along I've been saying this legitimately for months if the Republicans had come along to listen we're just going to fix Obamacare for the time being we're going to try and fix it and make some changes that move us in the right direction but it's not full Obamacare repeal we are gradually going to get to full Obamacare repeal then I would have signed on to this bill in all likelihood and I think probably so would Mike Lee but by calling it Obamacare repeal and replace the implication is that this was the last step so when people say that Obamacare was going to be repealed except for Mike Lee that's just nonsense it is just not true it is fully dishonest when people say that don't look to Mike Lee as the the cause of the collapse here there there are many causes of the collapse here but the first and foremost one is that Republicans rely okay they didn't actually want to get rid of Obamacare they just didn't okay and it's the constituents didn't President Trump didn't President Trump was one who insisted back in January by the way that we not do full-scale repeal instead we do repeal and replace that was Trump's suggestion and then he walked away from that when it turned out that people couldn't agree on what the replacement would look like and actually didn't want to do full-scale repeal so Trump was out there trying to claim this as a victory yesterday even though it was a loss this is what Trump does best he likes to spin and and the fact is that here is president Trump yesterday talking about how it was really a victory like if you wouldn't know any better than it was totally a victory we have 52 people we had four knows now we might have had another one somewhere in there but essentially the vote would have been pretty close to if you look at it forty eight to four that's a pretty impressive vote by any standard and yet you have a vote of forty eight to four or something like that and you need more it's pretty tough we have 52 people okay that is not impressive by any standard the standard is passing things it is like Hillary Clinton won the popular vote okay so you got 48 out of 52 first of all not even clear that there were 48 out of 52 it's just clear that four would not vote for it not that 48 would but you can't spend this as a victory when it is not a victory and as I said yesterday there was a vacuum of leadership from the top Trump doesn't know what's in this bill he doesn't really care what's in the spill he didn't use the bully pulpit in any way he didn't threaten moderates to get on board he didn't threaten conservatives to get on board he thinks that his Twitter basically alleviates him of the necessity of learning things and so he can just sweet things out and that will fix it that is not correct today he's supposed to have a bunch of senators to the White House where he's going to talk to them about these things we'll see if that moves the ball at all but unless he is actually actively going to use the power that he has to threaten senators who refuse to go along with him then he's not doing anything he's not as I said yesterday the only power that Trump has over these senators because his approval ratings in that high is that his approval rating among Republicans is still sky-high it's still 82% among Republicans that means he has the capacity to threaten them with funding cuts his the capacity to threaten them with primary challengers he hasn't done any of those things yet he's sort of sitting back and letting it happen and the reason he's sitting back and letting it happen is because he thinks that and it's an interesting strategy he thinks that if he just says that he's gonna let Obamacare fail then all will be well Obamacare it will collapse and then he will be there to pick up the pieces people will blame Democrats not Republicans this was his self stated strategy and he said this openly yesterday and I think you'll also agree that I've been saying for a long time let Obamacare fail and then everybody's going to have to come together and fix it and come up with a new plan and a plan that's really good for the people with much lower premiums not much lower cost and much better protection I've been saying that Mike I think you'll agree for a long time let Obamacare fail it'll be a lot easier and I think we're probably in that position where we'll just let Obamacare fail we're not going to own it I'm not going to own it I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it will let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say how do we fix it how do we fix it or how do we come up with a new plan okay this had been his original strategy then it might have worked but it's kind of funny to watch Mike Pence in these clips because he's awkwardly nodding even though he disagrees like yesterday Mike Pence said we still have to repeal so he's obviously disagree with President Trump but that's not his job right his job is to sort of be a yes-man for Trump in any case Trump saying let Obamacare fail there this would be a fine strategy if he had come out of the gate muted listen Obamacare is failing we have a problem here the only way this is getting solved is with a bipartisan solution so I want a call to the White House Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan and I want to have a series of meetings to set up a framework for AB Hardison fix on Obamacare and then when things collapse you say oh look at those Democrats they wouldn't work with us there was nothing we could do but that's not what Trump actually did right what Trump did is he went to his Republicans and he said we're going to repeal the whole thing that didn't happen anything we're going to repeal in a place the whole thing that isn't happening so now it looks like he's just making excuses and blaming Democrats that's actually what it looks like okay it's again there's a way to do this where you didn't actually put your handprint on Obamacare it's sort of here's the situation the sort is in the stone right and the Obamacare sort is in the stone that is the status quo the sword is in the stone the way to there are two things you could do about that you could either look at the Democrats and points at them and say listen the sword is in the stone it shouldn't be in the stone you're the ones who put it there and I know and you know that unless we cooperate we can't get the sword out of the stone or you could do a trump and the Republicans did and say if you elect us we will remove the sword from the stone and then they don't remove the sword from the stone and then they say well the sword is only in the stone because the Democrats put it there anyway okay that doesn't have the same appeal it doesn't have the same appeal and it's a bit of a mistake because Democrats are jumping on this to say okay well now he acknowledges that Obamacare is failing he acknowledges that the health care system has problems and he's not going to fix it in fact he's going to make it worse so if it were Democrats in there if you elected us we'd fix the thing right we wouldn't get rid of it we'd fix the thing is what Democrats are going to claim if you had elected us if you'd made us if you made Hillary the president he'd may put us in Congress we would have fixed the thing we would have removed the sword from the stone our selves but you elected Trump instead and so he's just going to bitch and complain about what exactly the white why the stones the sword is there in the first place so Trump is continuing to make this case he says you know we need to elect more republicans that's the goal here just elect more republicans so the way I look at it is in 18 we're going to have to get some more people elected we have to go out and we have to get more people elected at a Republican and we have to probably pull in those people those few people that voted against it I don't know they're going to have to explain to you why they did and I'm sure they'll have very fine reasons but we have to get more Republicans elected because we have to get it done we got it passed in the house we would have gotten it very much yeah you can't use his head as they stand right we don't want that to happen you messing with the wrong guy here so we want we want I think we're going to do very well actually in 18 I would be not surprised if something were done long before that but in any event because the margin is so small the majority margin is so small we're going to have to go out and get more Republicans elected in 18 and I'll be working very hard for that to happen okay okay so this has been the consistent Republican pitch for years right give us the house will repeal Obamacare give us the Senate will repeal Obamacare give us the presidency will repeal Obamacare I don't know how much longer you can run this scam when you run the majority in both houses and you're still not repealing Obamacare and have no intention of passing a full repeal Mitch McConnell is supposedly going to put the full repeal to a vote on Monday now understand something even the full repeal bill right did he plain simple repeal though doesn't actually repeal Obamacare because the regulations are still included it gets rid of the subsidies it gets rid of the taxes but it doesn't actually get rid of the Obamacare regulations what you're going to require some actual legislation separate legislation to get rid of the Obamacare regulations under the reconciliation rules do Republicans need more people in the Senate yes and now would be a great time to put more Republicans in the Senate considering that you've got I think 10 Democratic seats in red states that are up in this next election cycle so if Republicans were to pick up even four of those then they'd have a really solid majority going into the second half of trumps term but he is going to need to do a better job of making the case again if you're going to put blame on Democrats you have to explain why the blame is on Democrats yesterday Sarah Huckabee Smith as Huckabee Sanders rather she came out and she said that that it was Democrats fault that it was that this had all happened it's hard to make the case it's Democrats fault when you never reached out to Democrats in the first place so this is a botch basically from the beginning and I'm not sure that Trump is going to get out of it that easily now is it going to hurt Trump I don't know hurt Trump I think it'll hurt Congress so if you look at the generic congressional ballot right now generic congressional ballot has Democrats up ten that is wipeout territory for Republicans if the Democrats are up ten then Republicans if that were real right Democrats would win probably back the majority in the house unclear what happened in the Senate cos Senate races are different but may be in good shape to win back the majority in the house there's one poll statistic that's great for Trump in this which says that the 20% of Republic most enamored of Trump are highly likely to vote more likely to vote than 20% of Democrats who really hate Trump the question is about the lukewarm Republicans the lukewarm and what do those lukewarm Republicans think about all this are they feeling good right now are they feeling enthused right now so I think what you're going to see is President Trump go back to bashing the media because if legislation is hard bashing the media is easy he can do it unilaterally ginza by himself the base loves it he's going to run against the media in 2018 even if there is nothing else for him to run on meanwhile the Democrats are going to say listen Republicans refuse to even make basic fixes there's talk that Trump is going to remove some of the subsidies for the Obamacare exchanges and exacerbate the death spiral in order to bring Democrats to the table Democrats are saying well that's mean and that's cruel so their case is going to be listen we all know the things flawed but only one party here wants to actually fix it and it's not the Republicans who won't even repeal and replace that's exactly what Bernie Sanders is saying saying Trump wants millions of people to suffer well by responses last I heard Trump was the President of the United States the leader of our country Republicans controlled the house and dissented and it is beyond comprehension all I know it's you know we keep saying this about Donald Trump but it is beyond comprehension that you have a president who basically wants millions of people to sup up so he thinks that he can win some political points okay the problem is that what Trump is saying runs directly into the teeth of this okay when when Trump says let Obamacare fail and then Democrat and then standard services when these times when Obamacare fail what he means is he wants millions of people to die right when he says that it has a little more credibility than it normally would because he's not offering any alternative right and this is this is the big problem here Chuck Schumer says the same thing he says the Republican plan is going to kill the patient obviously it's exaggerated language obviously he's wrong obviously he's lying it's amazing if the Republicans had just repealed this thing we'd go back to status quo ante which was no Obamacare when 92% of Americans had health insurance I think so the fact is that the vast majority of Americans always had health insurance it's not that Obamacare saved millions of people or anything but that's the case Schumer is trying to make in fact passing repeal and having it go into effect two years later is in many ways worse than the Republican healthcare bill that was just rejected by my Republican colleagues it's like if our health care system was a patient who came in and needed some medicine the Republicans proposed surgery the operation was a failure now Republicans are proposing a second surgery that will surely kill the patient medicine is needed bipartisan medicine not a second surgery okay and this is why I was important to have a clear strategy going and not because Schumer is anything but a liar he is an absolute liar and as evidence deduction was a liar yesterday he tweeted out that anti-zionism is anti-semitism this is a guy who endorsed for the leadership of the Democratic National Committee keith ellison a devotee of louis farrakhan who has had multiple anti-semitic things in the past and hung out with with anti-semites you know Chuck Schumer is a pathological liar on politics but this is a game and you have to know how to play the game and the Democrats right now are out playing the Republicans even from a minority position it is amazing to watch how incompetent that Republicans are about all of this well before we get to the more news about Trump there's there's some polls out that show how Trump is going to run in 2020 and we'll talk about that in just a second but before we get to that I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at stamps.com so if you're tired of waiting in line at the post office you just don't

would the Republicans be in trouble in Congress they'd be in trouble in the presidential polls and indeed if you look at the latest poll from Public Policy Polling yes it's a democratic polling firm and yes these polls don't mean a lot when they're far out but it's kind of interesting to look at it the the fact is that right now if Trump ran against most of the major Democratic candidate he would lose so they talked to 836 registered voters they said that that majority wish that Obama were president versus trump and already wished that Hillary would present instead of Trump although she has worse approval ratings than Trump does but though the ones that matter is that against Joe Biden in a hypothetical matchup against Joe Biden he would supposedly lose 54 to 39 against Bernie Sanders 52 to 39 so before everybody says well polling is just terrible polling is always wrong the polling at the national polling had the state polling was off in the last election cycle the national polling was not off the national polling was on so before you do before you say to me all polls are worthless it is not good when the current presidents of the United States is in for you know he's only been in for six months this should be the high points of his term he's already losing to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders combined age 2309 by double digits he's apparently losing in a hypothetical contest with Elizabeth Warren now and I don't believe cory booker 45:40 Kamala Harris 4140 now this should be a Democrat this is what's truly fascinating about where the Democrats are so I keep talking about the problems Republicans are having which makes sense since they're the governing party and they're not good at it but the problems the Democrats are having are so much worse there's so much worse than the problems Republicans are having yes Republicans are bad at everything except for increasing military spending and tax cuts those are the only two things the Republicans are good at because they have no consensus on anything else but the Democrats have not figured out what exactly that party is about is their party about big government socialism the sort of cross-cultural socialism of Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders or are they still so in love with the men of Barack Obama they're going to pursue intersectionality down to its root look at those poll numbers again because this is what's fascinating not that Trump's going to lose to all these people because you know it doesn't mean anything we're we're too far out but look at the contrast Joe Biden 54 Bernie Sanders 52 Warren 49 Booker 45 Kamala Harris 41 which one of those names has been the hottest in the Democratic press lately Kamala Harris right the senator from California the first term senator from California why not because she's good at her job she's unbelievably crappy at her job just like she was unbelievably crappy of being Attorney General in my state but why do they like her because she is a black woman and this means that she has checked two of the intersectional boxes for people who don't understand what intersectionality is basically intersectionality suggests that all of American society was designed to privilege white males and that there is an intersectional hierarchy of people who have been victimized by American society whose credibility cannot be challenged when they talk about how America needs to change so at the very top you have LGBT folks and then you have black women and then you have black men and then you have Hispanic women and then you have a Spanish men and then you have Asians and then you have Jews and then finally way down at the bottom you have white males right that will marry Muslims ranked somewhere between blacks and LGBT folks so the intersectional hierarchy the Democrats have decided that it is more important for them to cobble together a coalition of the dispossessed right a coalition of the angry then it is to actually come up with a message that appeals to a broad swath of Americans which is why they ally with people like Linda Sarsour it's why they push people like keith ellison they've doubled down on identity politics because they believe that the demographics of the country are moving in their direction and if they continue to alienate white voters it won't make a difference this failed them in 2016 because white voters white blue-collar voters for the first time voted as a racial bloc in almost racial bloc more white blue-collar voters voted for President Trump than Hispanics voted for Hillary Clinton in the last election cycle okay white voters voted as an intersectional hierarchy group in Reverse but Democrats are still doing this and so when you look at the actual be a hint of Democrats are they're too stupid to ticket and when you look at the the candidates are most likely to succeed against Trump as candidates like Joe Biden a white male Bernie Sanders a white male Elizabeth Warren a white woman and then you go down the list and you get to black man Cory Booker black woman Kamala Harris so precisely the opposite of what the intersectional hierarchy would suggest would be a successful strategy is what would work and that's what Democrats are rejecting Democrats are much more interested than focusing in full scale on which person can we pick who is going to please minority communities even if they have no broad-based appeal like Kamala Harris pretty amazing stuff the Democrats are not going to take that advice we're going to talk about that in just a second but for that I'm going to have to go

subscribe we always appreciate it we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation meanwhile while all this is going on you know well the Democrats are struggling to come up with an identity they keep centering around people like Linda Sarsour okay so yesterday I thought this was just amazing the Democrats the the women's March we talked about this two days ago the women's March had paid tribute to Assata Shakur who's an actual terrorist like an actual terrorist human being who shot a cop in New Jersey back in the 1970s minute 79 and then fled to Cuba they paid tribute to her and they did this whole shtick about how they don't believe in her violence but they appreciate that she fought sexism within the black within the Black Panther Party which is like saying I don't appreciate what a ton bin Laden does with American buildings but I do appreciate him fighting Islamophobia around the world no no no but the women's March tweeted that out so Jake Tapper who as I've said before is one of the few people in the media who I think actually tries to get it right and I know there's a lot of disagreement about Jake Tapper in on the right but I think Jake is actually attempting to be intellectually honest is he's still a guy of the left I think he is but he's an intellectually honest fellow or at least attempts to be and so yesterday he tweeted this out Shakur is a cop-killer fugitive in Cuba this ugly sentiments from Linda Sarsour and the Dyke March in Chicago you remember that store it's where the the lesbian March in Chicago banned Jews because they were flying a flag that had a Jewish town and it made the intersectional hierarchy uncomfortable he said any progressives out there condemning this which is exactly right and then Sarsour call Jake Tapper a member of the of the alt right she said Jake Tapper please share my ugly sentiments unapologetically Muslim upon apologetically Palestinian pro-immigrant Pro Justice shame okay so first of all whenever people say shame they usually have no real reason to do so that goes to Game of Thrones as well in any case Linda Sarsour says what about me in Tibet and Jake Tapper immediately slams or he says your comments about ayaan Hirsi Ali from one so if you recall she said about ayaan Hirsi Ali who is a who is in a Muslim who's no longer Muslim wrenchy issues a heretic under Muslim law she was generally mutilated by MS Lamas and then they attempted to force her into a child marriage she fledged ended up in Denmark and and now she lives in the United States I believe that she's nerd sending all Ferguson the historian from Harvard and and Linda Sarsour had said that she wished she could remove eye on her scalese vagina so Jake Tapper's calling her out on that and there's no whole history I mean we've talked about Linda Sarsour before Linda Sarsour is a radical she is somebody who has spoken highly of terrorists and terrorist groups before she's really a devastatingly bad human being and Jake Tapper took her to the woodshed here when even Jake Tapper is taking you to the woodshed because you're so extreme that should say something to the Democratic Party but it doesn't because the Democratic Party is so ensconced in its own belief that all that matters is building a coalition to take down Western civilization that they don't care who they include in that coalition from Linda Sarsour to Assata Shakur none of it matters you know cop killers terrorist apologists none of it none of it matters so the Democrats are still having this trouble which means the only unity they have is again as always being anti Republicans so last night they went nuts because apparently President Trump had an undisclosed meeting with Vladimir Putin there was a big meeting over at the g20 there's big dinner that was held by the by Angela Merkel over at the g20 and apparently during the dinner president Trump who is not seated next to Vladimir Putin but Melania was he got up and he walked away from where he was sitting he walked around to Vladimir Putin pulled up a chair and proceeded to have a full hour conversation with no other American official present so I didn't bring Rex Tillerson he didn't bring a Russian translator the only person who was there was Bouton's translator which is not great because you never know what if Putin translator is telling Trump lies right I mean Putin could be saying look at this America look up these American schmuck and then the translator says he says you're a wonderful guy or I mean it could that that's exactly what could be happening plus you know Putin is old KGB this is not if you are in Trump's cabinet the last thing you want is a meeting where you don't have anyone in there who is able to at least monitor what's being said we've had this problem before last time Trump was in a room alone with Russians he ended up spilling Israeli national security information that put in danger an Israeli spy who is trying to spy on Isis so you have this meeting and the media goes crazy oh this is obviously something nefarious going on now listen do I think that when you have a meeting that's an hour long at one of these things that we should know what's happening yes because I am for full-scale transparency from any president and I don't think that that's really appropriate I do want to know from the media and I just don't know the answer to this is it that Trump has lots of meetings with Russians and then doesn't disclose it or is it Trump has lots of meetings with everyone and doesn't disclose it I mean I've seen reports that he had meetings with with various other governmental actors over the last six months and then it was reported like four days later but no one cared because it wasn't Russia so it's hard to tell how much of this is real and how much of this is just the media thinking that every time from eat something with russian dressing on it he's spying with Vladimir Putin in any case Putin continues to speak highly from peers with Vladimir Putin had to say about him well most additional component he met with Donald Trump recently I couldn't include pretty interesting to hear your impression of him as a person on you know coca-cola Rick Truman years ago I did not expect mission I believe it is very important for a person who has a public profile on politicians who want to meet solutions he has the ability to let him switch room of really risks what our conversation wasn't like reform comes abuse abuse you do not know what he is like with other people he talks to but during our conversation with I listened to him with attention as well formidable story time we do any without his ideas and proposals on development cooperation and he didn't say that's good if you know there's something does not happen excuse me couple person who works in people who is involved in tolerance I reiterate museum vitally important ability you were to be able to listen and respond and communicate promptly that substantial experience emulation who put there's a pollution effects pretty much you suspected Rococo to compare some people who only hear themselves whatever you want held on quote is like a buzz in the background for them or the corkscrew when you're talking that interesting it also are you with them couple misogyny the Buckeyes simply to current US president is different he responds what his interlocutor says when the argument he responds them okay so another one other words Putin is trying to butter up from that's the way that you do it this is why you don't want to have these meetings alone Trump tweeted out that the media is making a big deal out of all of this and I tend to believe the Trump is correct about this he says fake news story of secret dinner with Putin is sick in quotation marks I mean he might be right about this but he really needs learn how to use scare quotes that's not how they work says all g20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany press new well to be fair the press wasn't saying that the meeting itself this dinner was secret they were saying that he never disclosed that he talked with Putin for an hour the White House released a statement saying as a brief meet and greet people in the room say it was an hour so there's still details to come out but the media's going to continue jumping all over the Russia thing and playing off every little thing which means that Trump should be careful here because you know if you want to win then you might want to just be careful about how you how you conduct yourself there's no reason to give the other side this much this much material on a day-in day-out basis so final conclusion here with regard to Obama care and where it is going I don't think that what happened with Obama care is going to damage from it is very obvious that the Republican press are not interested in going after Trump in any way because the constituency for Republicans is still much more enamored of Trump than with Republican Congress people by Republican Congress people are still much more unpopular than Trump so you're seeing an motivated attempt by the media on the right to guard Trump from the blowback that means that Trump has the power to push something through he doesn't have to I think what's more likely to happen is Trump is likely to continue shilly-shallying around not really taking a solid position on Obama care nothing gets past Republicans get blamed in the Congress Trump separates himself off and then he works with Democrats I think that is the most likely thing but you never know right it's all unpredictable I do not know that his strategy of let it all fail and then Republicans won't pay for it is is going to work however okay we're going to get some things I

and then we'll do some things that I hate so things that I like so Martin Landau died this week which is really sad Martin Landau is a really charming actor for some reason I always just get him mixed up with Leonard Nimoy but they're very different actors Martin Landau is a much more versatile actor than Leonard Nimoy he was in a lot of stuff the thing that I grew up with him in was Mission Impossible when I was growing up my parents used to rent for us old TV shows they didn't actually let us watch a lot of the Current TV because it was too sexualized so they would go out and they'd rent old episodes of The Waltons we go down to Eddie Brandt's Saturday matinee which is the greatest video store in human history we'd go over there and we would get old they had like full seasons of The Waltons and Mary Tyler Moore and the Dick Van Dyke Show so we grew up on all that TV and one of the shows that I used to watch this also show reruns of it so I used to get up and watch them was a Mission Impossible the original Mission Possible which is much better than the movies so a lot of people like the movies movies have nothing to do with Mission Impossible basically they kept the name and then they have nothing like the entire premise of Mission Impossible is all these clever plots and most Mission Impossible now is Tom Cruise which is Jack Reacher which is Top Gun which is you know Tom Cruise being an action star and running around leaping off buildings that was never the Mission Impossible thing the Mission Impossible thing was always you have a team that's working and then very little of the jumping off buildings action sequences is much more driven by can they create a plot to prevent something bad from happening here at the original trailer music from Mission Impossible you'll see Martin Landau his shtick was that he was always dressing up in somebody so every episode he put on a wig or he'd put on like a fake nose and then he would just take it off whoo ooh Martin Landau is dressed up in something is it's fantastic so here is the original mission impossible there's one right there take namaste right Peter Graves was the original star tonight beautiful barber vain horse this is the great trend so do you go watch from the old episode it's really really good he he also had a long career in Hollywood he did a lot of pretty good movies he made his first major film appearance you'll remember in North by Northwest who was the right-hand man of James Mason who is the major criminal in that he was also in Cleopatra and the greatest story ever told and you'll remember that he was also in rounders right so if you say if you've seen rounders he's great in rounders he's the the old law professor who basically tells Matt Damon to pursue his dream of being a loser gambler so that says he's great in that and he he's in his later days he got less productive obviously but he does have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame a very very good actor and sad to see him go okay so other things that I like so this was just hilarious yesterday Chris Christie the rotund governor of New Jersey who everyone hates at this point went to a Mets game and if you're chris Christie probably the worst thing you could do right now is go into a highly public setting and a ball is hit and you'll see Chris Christie catch it and watch what the crowd does and a souvenir for Chris Christie are you kidding me how about that you just noticed payment here who are you HOT I'll tell you this is smelly round between innings there twenty other lie you know get the ball left Hannity hatch and Chrissy's reached out it cuz actually pretty good catch my Christmas right all right he catches it nice to see doesn't matter still gets booed because he's chris Christie which is just epic so you gotta love that about the Mets crowd I am NOT the biggest fan of New Yorkers as a general matter but that is pretty spectacular so well done New York Mets fans kind of love it okay time for a couple of things that I hate the first thing that I hate is late on Monday the Trump administration certified to Congress that Iran has been meeting its necessary requirements under the joint comprehensive plan of action this would be Obama's Iran deal as you recall President Trump promised the day one he was going to pull out of the Iran deal on the very first day he was going to pull out of it it is still operative and he has now twice certified that Iran is in compliance the problem with that is that the Iran deal specifically allows them to continue operating without sanctions it continues to allow them to develop their centrifuges at a certain rate it requires them supposedly to reduce the number of functional centrifuges used to enrich uranium and forfeit uranium stockpiles but they say that they say that that Iran is is violating the spirit of the agreement but they're not violating the text of the agreement and then you have the State Department saying that Iran remains one of the most dangerous threats to US interests okay if that's the case then just reject the stupid deal just reject the stupid deal in last April Obama Trump was slamming the Obama deal as disastrous he said in front of a packed it was catastrophic hey either kill the deal or don't kill the deal but this routine where you split the baby is getting very irritating and repeatedly repeatedly you get this routine from the from the front from the Trump administration where they say that they are going to stand by the they're going to stand by some conservative position and they don't do it so the term administration just brought in they just issued 15,000 new travel visas for people who are coming in to work for foreigners they have now announced the Trump administration has also announced a from keeping the Iran deal there are a couple of other things that are that are skipping that are that I'm missing here that they've done in the last couple of days that are not good posited the Cuba policy for example they said that they were going to reject Obama's Cuba policy they'd kept most of Obama's Cuba policy in place again don't pee on our leg and tell us it's raining okay if you don't actually want to do anything about something don't promise you're going to do it don't make promises you can't fulfill especially when your entire shtick is politicians are all dirty politicians are all liars I'm not one of them okay other things that I hated in Rohrbacher who's a congressman out here in California know whether put this in things I like the things I hate just because it's so absurd Dana Rohrabacher who I know and Dana is a nice guy I've spoken at one of his events and he has like a drinking beer st. Patty's Day event and and Dana Rohrabacher I was questioning someone from NASA yesterday and this is the thing that actually happened in America in the Congress the most important thing was if Mars can I ask permission war for one minute for this question and that is you have indicated that Mars had egg was totally different thousands of years ago is it possible that there was a civilization on Mars thousands of years ago so the evidence is that Mars was different billions of years ago and built thousands of years ago well yes and and there would be there's no evidence that I'm aware of that would you rule that out but see there are some people well anyway I would it is I would say that is extremely unlikely so that is the thing that happened a fitting Congress person in the United States suggested that there was a civilization on Mars thousands of years ago because they said that there was changes on the surface of Mars billions of years ago so good job Dana Rohrabacher is also known affectionately as putin's putin's congress person who's been very very warm for vladimir putin but this is a i think that you may want to think about qualification if you're worrying about whether or not there was civilization on Mars if there is can we send congress there in any case okay so other things that I hate so yesterday Tucker Carlson who I thought he had to debate with spoot which I refrained from commenting on because I just didn't see the point I thought it was quite an awful exchange of Max food actually I thought the max boot was largely correct I thought Tucker was was wildly disingenuous in the interview I think Tucker's really good at his job and he's really talented but I think that he's demagogic and his approach in in many of these cases he laughs off any legit criticism of him he uses he insults his the person that he's talking to as a preemptory as a peremptory measure and then he and then he starts doing me the hysterical laugh at the end of his show if he if he doesn't want to talk about something you know again he has such talent I wish that he'd put it to better use than saying that Russia is not in the top five threats against the United States in an attempt to kind of mimic tapi Canon ISM now moving further and further to the the paleo con right he had on max Blumenthal the other night max Blumenthal is legitimately one of the scum here people in American politics I'm just a pig somebody who used to attack Andrew Breitbart regularly live out him max Blumenthal is in a self-hating Jew he's an ethnic Jew but he has absolutely nothing to do with Judaism book called Goliath that's been widely panned in which you're repeatedly compared to Israel to the Nazis which is about the most insulting thing that you can do to both Israel and Jews generally he is a pig of a and just a disgusting disgusting radical human being and Tucker has him on the show why does he have max Blumenthal on the show because max Blumenthal agrees there's nothing to this Trump Russia stuff so it's very important that you give a platform to one of the worst people on planet earth in order that you can talk about it I thought the Democrats should have responded with a big narrative against permanent war and for economic equality instead they're pushing Russia scandal-mongering non-stop it subsumed all of the progressive grassroots grassroots movements I believed in and it's basically buried the left in a militaristic narrative that ambitious figures like Jamie Raskin are advancing mark my words Tucker when Trump is gone this narrative this Russia hysteria will be repurposed by the political establishment to attack the left and anyone on the Left Bernie Sanders like politician who steps out of line on the issues of permanent war or corporate free trade things like that will be painted as a Russia puppet so this is very dangerous and people who are progressive who are falling into it need to know what the long-term consequences of this cynical narrative are it seems virtually everyone on the left in Washington with some exceptions your one I know a couple others but I know people who I think it was reasonable I don't agree with them but who seemed to really believe that Vladimir Putin was in control the last election do you think they believe it I don't know I think there's so I can't speak for other people I'm not a mind-reader but there's definitely a political app put a political class in Washington that sees Russia scandal-mongering as a silver bullet to take out Trump and then you have the Democrats who are basically the Democratic in other words hunger is so eager to get somebody who is purportedly of the left to turn a purportedly of the hard left to talk about why the Trump Russian stuff isn't the thing that he brings on somebody like max Blumenthal this is the same things when sean has on Julian Assange to talk about how Trump Russia isn't the thing and then couch him as a hero okay the the right is making all sorts of new friends if your allegiance to a particular political figure is forcing you into alignment with people like max Blumenthal and Julian Assange and you are now welcoming them as friends and treating them with with anything but disdain let me recommend to you that you've made some mistakes in your life okay you shouldn't be part of a of a movement that is now making common cause with with people like Julian Assange was put American lives in danger or max Blumenthal one of the scummiest people on earth it's amazing I mean remember Sidney Blumenthal was Hillary Clinton's hatchet man so we're now at the point house is so topsy-turvy and so circular but at this point Sidney Blumenthal who used next woman doll as an advisor on Israel to Hillary Clinton is appearing on Tucker Carlson's show to defend Donald Trump because Tucker Carlson wants to defend Trump I mean that's how crazy all of this has gotten you know the rules have change and there are no rules anymore it's catch as catch can but in people with principles should think twice before they start making way for people like max Blumenthal just cuz he's saying some things you like really really quite disgusting okay so we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest on ben shapiro this is the venture hero show you
