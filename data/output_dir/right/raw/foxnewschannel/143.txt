FREEDOMS IN THE MARKETS AND THE

118
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:30,725

RESPONSIBILITY THAT COMES WITH

120
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,995
IT OR ADMITTING THAT SAFETY

121
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,497

AMERICAN MILITARY SUPREMACY OVER

139
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,791

MILITARY ADVANCEMENTS, IT'S

147
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,371
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE IN THE TECH

148
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,339
SECTOR THAT PUT THEIR COUNTRY

149
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,140
AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE.

150
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:22,010

157
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:31,486
THAT BLEW ME AWAY.

158
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:36,357
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF

159
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:37,091
TAYLOR SWIFT BUILDING AN AMAZING

160
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:42,330

UNDER ATTACK BY PRESIDENT TRUMP

164
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,539
MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE HE OWNS

165
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,941
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AND THEN

166
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,209
TRUMP SAYS THE POSTAL SERVICE

167
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,678
GETTING RIPPED OFF BY AMAZON.

168
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,111
IT'S CONSTANT.

169
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,981
JEFF BEZOS COMES OUT AND SAYS

170
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,416
AMERICA IS A GREAT COUNTRY AND

171
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,451
WE HAVE TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY

172
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:04,185
AND THEN THE CONSERVATIVES ARE

173
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,888
BLOCKING IN DEFENSIVE JEFF

174
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,355
BEZOS.

175
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,924
HOW INTERESTING, HOW CONVENIENT.

176
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:10,625

177
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:13,928
OUR MINDS.

178
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:20,201

PATRIOT.

180
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,604
>> Juan: SAYING THAT WE HAVE A

181
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:25,173
MORAL ISSUE IN TERMS OF FACIAL

182
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,140
RECOGNITION STUFF BEING USED

184
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:28,243
IT'S NOT ONLY OVERSEAS BUT IN

AMERICAN RIGHTS.

188
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:34,182
I AGREE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT

189
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:35,817

191
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,520
I ALSO AGREE THAT JEFF BEZOS,

192
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,356
WHEN HE SAYS THE SENIOR

193
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:42,957
LEADERSHIP SOMETIMES HAS TO MAKE

194
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:43,691
A DECISION THAT'S NOT POPULAR,

195
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:45,727
WHAT'S THE RIGHT DECISION.

196
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,462
I THINK HE MADE THE RIGHT

197
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,964
DECISION BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY

198
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,400
THAT EVERYBODY WHO HAS A MORAL

199
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:54,669
ISSUE IS SOMEHOW A WIMP OR

200
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,737
UNPATRIOTIC.

201
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,739
>> Greg: I DISAGREE.

202
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,407
THEY ARE UNPATRIOTIC AND THEY

203
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:00,208
ARE WIMPS.

204
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:00,775
>> Dana: CASE CLOSED.

205
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,443
>> Greg: THEY ARE BENDING TO A

206
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,978
FEW LOUD VOICES BECAUSE THEY

207
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,348
DON'T WANT THE P.R. NIGHTMARE.

208
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:08,816
>> Dana: SILICON VALLEY IS IN

209
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,151
A POLITICAL AND ETHICAL

210
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:10,685
MINEFIELDS.

211
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,186
VICTORY IN WAR IS INCREASINGLY

212
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:13,621
DEPENDENT ON NOT JUST WHAT

213
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,556
HAPPENS IN THE BATTLEFIELD BUT

214
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:16,291
YOUR MILITARY SERVERS AND CYBER

215
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,992
WARFARE CAPABILITIES.

216
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:19,994
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE

217
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:21,996
OUT, WHO DO THEY WANT TO HELP?

218
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:22,997
THE BOTTOM LINE?

219
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:24,165
ARE THEY WILLING TO HELP CHINA

220
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,500
ON SOME OF THIS?

221
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:28,436
WHEN IT STARTED, THE PHRASE WAS

222
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:31,039
DON'T BE EVIL.

223
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,573
I'M PRETTY SURE WITH THE CHINESE

224
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,943
ARE DOING WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS

225
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,744
EVIL.

226
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:38,513
THEY CAN'T SEE THAT AMERICANS

227
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,415
WANT TO USE BETTER TECHNOLOGY TO

228
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,383
LIMIT COLLATERAL DAMAGE SO THAT

229
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:43,785
YOU AREN'T HURTING INNOCENT

230
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:44,752
CIVILIANS.

231
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:46,387
YOU CAN TARGET MORE PRECISE THEN

232
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,856
YOU'RE GOING AFTER TERRORISTS.

233
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:54,395
BIG TECH HAS REPLACED BIG BANKS.

234
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:56,798
THE REASON I SAY IT'S IN THE

235
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,665
MINEFIELD, EACH SIDE,

236
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,102
REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS, ARE MAD

237
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:02,270
AT THE TECH CEOs.

238
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,005
>> Greg: TECH IS WALL STREET.

239
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,373
EVERYBODY HATED WALL STREET.

240
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:06,407
NOW WALL STREET IS RELEVANT

241
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:10,611
REALLY INTACT.

242
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:12,680
>> Juan: YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT

243
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,148
AI, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

244
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:16,951
WHAT WOULD GREG SAY ABOUT KILLER

245
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:18,119
ROBOTS BEING SENT TO KILL OUR

246
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,453
ENEMIES?

247
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,421
>> Greg: I WOULD LOVE THAT

248
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:21,322
BECAUSE THAT MEANS FEWER

249
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:22,357
HUMAN BEINGS BEING KILLED.

250
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,692
I WOULD RATHER SEND A ROBOT.

251
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:25,526
>> Juan: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE

252
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,863
SELL IT TO SAUDIS.

253
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,497
>> Morgan: THAT'S ALREADY

254
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:29,864
HAPPENING.

255
00:07:29,865 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN
