00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,210
YOU TO KNOW HE DOESN'T TAKE
CORPORATE PAC MONEY, THAT'S ALL

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,220
REAL PEOPLE GIVING HIM MONEY,

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,510

BE ONE OF THE GREATEST DAYS IF
BETO.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,890
TAKES HIM DOWN.

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,890
BY THE WAY

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,020
WE WILL HAVE THE LINK TO DONATE
TO BETO O'ROURKE IN THE

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,649
DISCRETION BOX, AS WELL AS ALL
THE CANDIDATES.

28
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,759
BY THE WAY, WE

29
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,039
ARE NOT DONE WITH BETO YET --

30
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:40,429
>>WOW, 140,000 DIFFERENT
CONTRIBUTIONS.

31
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:41,770
THAT'S AMAZING,

32
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,950
MAN.

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,499
WATCH OUT, CRUZ, HERE COMES
BETO --

34
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:57,649
>>HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE DOING A
GREAT JOB IN RAISING MONEY

35
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,399
AGAINST A WELL-KNOWN INCUMBENT
--

36
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:16,040
>>IN A CONGRESSIONAL RACE
THAT'S A GIGANTIC AMOUNT.

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
RANDY

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,590
BRYCE ALSO DOESN'T TAKE
CORPORATE PAC MONEY.

39
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,590
HOW DO I

40
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,590
KNOW?

41
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,750
BECAUSE HE'S A JUSTICE
DEMOCRAT.

42
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,750
THESE GUYS RAISING

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:30,970
THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM SMALL
DONORS IS UNHEARD OF --

44
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:47,310
>>LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S SO
IMPORTANT, AND NOW HAVING TALKED

45
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,610
TO A LOT OF THE JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS, SEEN THEIR CAMPAIGNS,

46
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,030
MONEY MATTERS DETERMINED THIS
AMOUNT.

47
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,290
NOT JUST FOR RUNNING AN

48
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,950
EFFICIENT, EXPENSIVE TV ADS, BUT
ALSO BECAUSE YOU NEED STAFFERS

49
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,170
WHO ARE GOING TO ORGANIZE YOUR
VOLUNTEERS, UNIQUE CAMPAIGN

50
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,350
OFFICES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF
THE STATE.

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,350
IN A GIANT STATE LIKE

52
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,310
TEXAS IF YOU ARE O'ROURKE OR
ALISON HARTSON IN CALIFORNIA YOU

53
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,480
NEED MONEY TO BUY THE VOTER
ROLLS, IT GOES ON AND ON, AND

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,920
EVEN DIGITAL ADS TAKES A LOT OF
MONEY.

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
SO KEEP IT GOING, GUYS,

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,010
BOTH TO THE CANDIDATES AND THOSE
GIVING THEM SMALL DOLLAR

57
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,300
DONATIONS, IF WE KNOCKED OUT TED
CRUZ AND PAUL RYAN WILL BE

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,600
UNREAL AND I BELIEVE IT'S
EMINENTLY DOABLE.

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
BY THE WAY, WE

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,210
ALSO HAVE RANDY BRYCE'S LINK
DOWN BELOW IN THE DESCRIPTION

61
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,870
BOX AND THE COMMENT SECTION ON
FACEBOOK, GO AND PARTICIPATE,

62
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,970
NOW LET ME TURN TO ALISON
HARTSON RUNNING AGAINST DIANNE

63
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,500
FEINSTEIN IN CALIFORNIA --

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:04:16,940
>>SHE BEAT THEM BOTH COMBINED.

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,000
THAT'S THE LEGENDARY FEINSTEIN.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,358
YOU KNOW WHAT FEINSTEIN HAD TO
DO?

67
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,359
SHE HAD TO LEND HER OWN

68
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,240
CAMPAIGN 5 MILLION BUCKS.

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,350
NOW,
SHE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE SHE'S

70
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,720
ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY, SHE HAS
ABOUT $80 MILLION, ACCORDING TO

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,479
THE BEST ESTIMATES, AND HER
HUSBAND IS A BILLIONAIRE, SO 5

72
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,650
MILLION IS NO BIG DEAL FOR THEM.

73
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,139
THEY DON'T EVEN BOTHER TAKING

74
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,460
VOLUNTEERS ON FEINSTEIN'S
WEBSITE.

75
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,120
ALISON HARTSON IS OF

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,711
COURSE POWERED BY VOLUNTEERS,
SHE HAS OVER 1400 VOLUNTEERS IN

77
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:48,979
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND
THAT'S WHY SHE'S DOING A GREAT

78
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:49,979
JOB.

79
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,620
WE'VE GOT HER LINK DOWN
BELOW AND IT'S EASY THROUGH

80
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,380
MEMBER, IT'S
JUSTICEDEMOCRATS.COM/ALISON,

81
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,529
MAKE SURE YOU CONTRIBUTE, AS YOU
CAN TELL WITH THE NUMBERS SHE'S

82
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:03,419
DOING GREAT COMPARED TO HER
OPPONENTS BUT SHE NEEDS A LOT

83
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,870
MORE MONEY TO RUN IN A GIGANTIC
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA.

84
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,870
SHE NEEDS

85
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,909
TO HIRE A LOT MORE VOLUNTEER
COORDINATORS, FIELD

86
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,970
COORDINATORS, AND THEN OF COURSE
BE ABLE TO RUN THE TOUGH-HITTING

87
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,509
ADS SHE'S BEEN DOING LATELY.

88
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,990
AND
ONE MORE THING OVERALL HERE, WE

89
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,139
HAVE MOMENTUM AND IT'S NOT JUST
FOR DEMOCRATS, IT'S FOR REAL

90
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,680
PROGRESSIVES, AND UNCORRUPTED
PROGRESSIVES.

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,249
AND I WANT TO GIVE

92
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:35,840
BETO O'ROURKE A LOT OF CREDIT
HERE, AND THE JUSTICE DEMOCRATS,

93
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,160
I AM PROUD THAT I HELPED FORM
THAT GROUP AND THEY SAID THEY

94
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,259
WILL NOT BACK ANY CANDIDATE IF
THEY TAKE CORPORATE PAC MONEY.

95
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:52,129
AND NOW AS YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF
PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOME FAIRLY

96
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,199
WELL-ESTABLISHED DEMOCRATS IN
THE SENATE, IF I COULD PUT IT

97
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,050
THAT WAY, ARE ALSO DECLARING
THAT THEY AREN'T TAKING

98
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,800
CORPORATE PAC MONEY.

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,370
I DON'T
KNOW THAT THE JUSTICE DEMOCRATS

100
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,750
WERE THE SOLE REASON, OF COURSE
NOT, BUT WHERE THEY PART OF THE

101
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,550
REASON, AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE
REASON, AS YOU HAVE 52

102
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,689
CANDIDATES OF JUSTICE DEMOCRATS
WHO SAY THEY WON'T TAKE

103
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,050
CORPORATE PAC MONEY AND A LOT OF
THEM ARE DOING WELL?

104
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,439
5 OF 7 WON

105
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:28,059
IN THE TEXAS PRIMARIES, THEY ARE
UNCORRUPTED AND THEY ARE

106
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:31,240
WONDERFUL AND THEY HAVE ALL THIS
MOMENTUM, AND I'M KIND OF PROUD

107
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,900
THAT WE HELPED TO START THE NO
CORPORATE PAC MONEY TREND.

108
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
BUT

109
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,349
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE
BEEN ON THAT BEFORE US, AND ONE

110
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,639
OF THEM IS BETO O'ROURKE.

111
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,400
THAT'S
WHY I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,029
AND GIVE HIM ALL THE CREDIT IN
THE WORLD, HE DECIDED TO NOT

113
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,479
TAKE ANY CORPORATE PAC MONEY
EVEN FOR JUSTICE DEMOCRATS WERE

114
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,020
AROUND, EVEN BEFORE IT BECAME
FASHIONABLE IN THE SENATE AND

115
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
OTHER PLACES.

116
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,840
SO NO WONDER HE'S
GOTTEN THE CREDIBILITY HE HAS

117
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,120
WITH ALL THOSE DONORS AND THE
SMALL DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING

118
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,800
IN, AND I'M SURE THE VOLUNTEERS
COMING IN.

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,970
WE WILL HAVE ALL THE

120
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,870
LINKS BELOW, GO TO THEIR
WEBSITES, DONATE IF YOU CAN,

121
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,990
VOLUNTEER IF YOU CAN,
ALISONHARTSON.COM/NOW TO

122
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,719
VOLUNTEER FOR HER IN CALIFORNIA,
YOU CAN HELP THEM BY MAKING

123
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:20,050
CALLS TO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN

124
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,699
WISCONSIN TO DEFEAT PAUL RYAN,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN

125
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,499
CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A REAL
PROGRESSIVE REPRESENT CALIFORNIA

126
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:30,590
LIKE ALISON HARTSON.

127
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,949
WONDERFUL
NEWS BUT IT'S ON YOU TO FINISH

128
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:33,949
THIS.

129
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,240
IF WE GET ALL THIS WAY AND
THEN DON'T WIN THESE ELECTIONS,

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,460
OF COURSE WE DIDN'T ACCOMPLISH
OUR GOAL.

131
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
WE'VE GOT TO FINISH

132
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
THEM.

133
00:07:42,460 --> 00:00:00,000
LET'S GO DO THAT TOGETHER.
