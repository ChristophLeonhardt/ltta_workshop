THANKFULLY TO THE UNITED STATES

11
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,062
AFTER SPENDING MONTHS INSIDE

12
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,897
HARD LABOR PRISON CAMPS ACROSS

13
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,499
NORTH KOREA.

14
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:25,067
THIS WAS A MAJOR DIPLOMATIC WIN

15
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,069
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE TRUMP

16
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:27,703
ADMINISTRATION AND A VERY

17
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:29,839
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR

18
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,239
NORTH KOREA.

19
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,208
MOST IMPORTANT, THREE AMERICAN

20
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,509
LIVES THANKFULLY WERE SAVED.

21
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,644
NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HISTORIC

22
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:37,246
SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN IS NOW

23
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,314
MOVING FORWARD, AS PLANNED.

24
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:40,182
TAKE A LOOK.

25
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:43,552
>> I APPRECIATE KIM JONG UN

26
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:46,455
DOING THIS AND ALLOWING THEM TO

27
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:47,656
GO.

28
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:48,858
WE PICKED A TIME.

29
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,993
WE PICKED A PLACE FOR THE

30
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:51,861
MEETING.

31
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,095
OR SUMMIT, AS YOU LIKE TO CALL

32
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:53,462
IT.

33
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:55,698
I THINK IT WILL BE VERY

34
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:56,732
SUCCESSFUL, BUT AS I ALWAYS SAY,

35
00:00:56,732 --> 00:00:57,166
WHO KNOWS.

36
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,868
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO

37
00:00:58,868 --> 00:00:59,235
HAPPEN.

38
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:01,270
IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY

39
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,238
IMPORTANT EVENT.

40
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:04,072
AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

41
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:07,643
THAT NOBODY THOUGHT WAS GOING TO

42
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:08,344
HAPPEN FOR YEARS OR MORE.

43
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,713
>> WHERE IS THE SUMMIT GOING TO

44
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:11,847
TAKE PLACE?

45
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:13,382
>> WE WILL ANNOUNCE THAT WITHIN

46
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:13,816
THREE DAYS.

47
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:19,288
WE ARE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS.

48
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,056
>> DO YOU DESERVE THE NOBEL

49
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:22,791
PRIZE, DO YOU THINK?

50
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,060
>> EVERYONE THINKS SO BUT I

51
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,661
WON'T SAY IT.

52
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:28,197
I WANT TO GET IT FINISHED.

53
00:01:28,197 --> 00:01:30,266
THE PRIZE I WANT IS VICTORY FOR

54
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,967
THE WORLD, NOT FOR EVEN HERE.

55
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,169
I WANT VICTORY FOR THE WORLD

56
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:34,770
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

57
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,671
TALKING ABOUT.

58
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,072
THAT'S THE ONLY PRIZE I WANT.

59
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:39,408
>> Sean: 88 HAS BEEN SET FOR

60
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:41,110
THE UPCOMING MEETING BETWEEN

61
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,744
TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN AND

62
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:42,878
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE DETAILS

63
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:45,314
AS WE GET THEM HERE LET ME BE

64
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:45,614
CLEAR.

65
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:47,917
THIS DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS, IT'S

66
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:48,484
NO ACCIDENT.

67
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,019
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK THE

68
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:52,688
REINS FROM BARACK OBAMA, LITTLE

69
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:54,023
ROCKET MAN WAS LAUNCHING

70
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:55,257
BALLISTIC MISSILES OVER JAPAN.

71
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,058
HE WAS THREATENING GUAM,

72
00:01:56,058 --> 00:01:57,226
THREATENING THE REST OF THE

73
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:57,526
WORLD.

74
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:00,262
OF COURSE, TESTING NUCLEAR

75
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:01,664
WEAPONS LEFT AND RIGHT AND OF

76
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,265
COURSE BALLISTIC MISSILES.

77
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:04,066
NOW ALL OF THESE AGGRESSIVE

78
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,100
TACTICS TO HAVE ENDED.

79
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,902
AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT.

80
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:08,571
THIS, THANKS TO THE HARD WORK,

81
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,872
NEGOTIATING SKILLS OF THE

82
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:11,540
PRESIDENT AND HIS BRAND-NEW

83
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,276
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO.

84
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:15,044
AFTER TIGHTENING SANCTIONS,

85
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:17,680
DEVELOPING A STRONG RELATIONSHIP

86
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,648
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA AND

87
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,684
THREATENING TO INTRODUCE NEW

88
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,018
TARIFFS, SENDING MULTIPLE

89
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,087
CARRIER STRIKE GROUPS TO THE

90
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,255
REGION, AND BERATING KIM JONG UN

91
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:28,290
ON THE WORLD STAGE, THE

92
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,058
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR IS NOW

93
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,459
LIMPING TO THE NEGOTIATING

94
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:31,260
TABLE.

95
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,262
IT IS ON THE TERMS THE

96
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:33,762
UNITED STATES SET.

97
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:37,499
WAIT, HANG ON.

98
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:41,570
REMEMBERS A FEW MONTHS AGO YOUR

99
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,471
CORRUPT MEDIA WAS TELLING YOU

100
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,473
DONALD TRUMP WAS LEADING US TO A

101
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:45,274
NUCLEAR WAR WITH NORTH KOREA.

102
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,875
HOW COULD THEY EVER GET

103
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,378
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRONG?

104
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:49,712
TYPICAL.

105
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:50,112
TAKE A LOOK.

106
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:52,047
>> THE IDEA OF A NUCLEAR

107
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,282
SHOWDOWN WITH NORTH KOREA KEEPS

108
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:54,950
YOU UP AT NIGHT, I WOULD

109
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,685
RECOMMEND DELETING YOUR TWITTER

110
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:56,952
APP.

111
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,654
>> NOT MERELY BEING CAVALIER

112
00:02:58,654 --> 00:02:59,888
WITH THE THREAT ABOUT NUCLEAR

113
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,256
WAR.

114
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,757
HE'S BEEN CAVALIER IN A WAY THAT

115
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:02,725
MAKES HIM SEEM DEMENTED.

116
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,860
>> THESE ARE THE MESSAGES FROM A

117
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,262
PERSON WHO IS NOT WELL, FROM A

118
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,730
LEADER WHO IS NOT FIT FOR

119
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,063
OFFICE.

120
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,199
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOADING

121
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,270
KIM JONG UN TO TEST A NUCLEAR

122
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,371
MISSILE AGAIN, TO PROVE ITS

123
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:18,674
RELIABILITY, TO SHOW HIM WRONG.

124
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,943
FUNDAMENTALLY I THINK IT COMES

125
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:21,777
ACROSS AS TWO KINDERGARTNERS WHO

126
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:24,179
ARE JOSTLING EACH OTHER, EXCEPT

127
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:29,385
THAT EACH HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

128
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:31,053
>> TOO LATE AFTER 100,000

129
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:32,254
AMERICANS DIE.

130
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,856
>> AFTER A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST.

131
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:36,292
>> OR AFTER A MILLION DIE.

132
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:38,260
>> THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.

133
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,461
IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION.

134
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,298
>> EXPERTS ARE WORRIED HE COULD

135
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:43,065
INADVERTENTLY TRIGGER A

136
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:43,465
CATASTROPHE.

137
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:44,767
>> Sean: THE TYPICAL MEDIA

138
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,935
BARRAGE DIDN'T END WELL OR AGE

139
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,236
WELL.

140
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:48,070
I ONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA,

141
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,805
ARE THEY GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR

142
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:51,273
THE HYSTERICAL COVERAGE, JUST

143
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,675
LIKE THEIR PHONY RUSSIAN

144
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,310
COVERAGE, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE I

145
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,077
GET WRONG?

146
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:57,246
IT'S UNLIKELY BECAUSE JUST

147
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:58,113
YESTERDAY, YES,

148
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,615
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," THE PAPER

149
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,083
OF RECORD, THEY ACTUALLY SLAMMED

150
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,452
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO

151
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,087
BECAUSE HE WAS ABSENT DURING

152
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:05,788
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S IRAN NUCLEAR

153
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:06,288
DEAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

154
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,489
THEN THEY FOUND OUT HE WAS

155
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:10,893
ACTUALLY NORTH KOREA RESCUING

156
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:12,227
AND SAVING AMERICAN HOSTAGES.

157
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,429
SOMETHING BARACK OBAMA COULD

158
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:14,697
NEVER GET DONE.

159
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,266
TRUMP RESPONDED TWO HOURS AGO ON

160
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,802
TWITTER, HE WROTE: "THE FEELING

161
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,303
"NEW YORK TIMES" CRITICIZE THE

162
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,671
SECRETARY OF STATE, POMPEO, FOR

163
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:24,106
BEING MISSING, WHEN HE WAS

164
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,475
FLYING TO NORTH KOREA.

165
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,043
FAKE NEWS SO BAD."

166
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:29,378
WE WILL GET BACK TO THE

167
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:31,380
ABUSIVELY BIASED MEDIA IN A

168
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,649
MOMENT BUT FIRST WE ARE ALSO

169
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,451
FOLLOWING VERY CLOSELY A

170
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,885
DEVELOPING SITUATION INSIDE OF

171
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:37,653
IRAN.

172
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:42,124
THE IDF IS REPORTING THAT

173
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:44,159
ISRAEL'S ABLE TO INTERCEPT

174
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,028
MULTIPLE ROCKETS FIRED BY

175
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:49,064
IRANIAN SOURCES FROM A SYRIAN

176
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:49,498
SYRIAN-BASED.

177
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,833
NO INJURIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

178
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,369
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH A

179
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,169
HIGH-RANKING ISRAELI OFFICIAL

180
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,806
WHO IS NOW CONFIRMED TO ME THIS

181
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:59,141
WAS IN RESPONSE TO ISRAEL'S

182
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,342
MILITARY ACTIONS, AND IN FACT I

183
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,445
HAVE CONFIRMATION ISRAEL TONIGHT

184
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:04,279
NOT LONG AGO HAS RETALIATED.

185
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,248
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE OF

186
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:08,650
THAT IN THE MOMENT WITH COLONEL

187
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,084
OLIVER NORTH.

188
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:09,818
YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE

189
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:14,056
THE IMPORTANT DECISION TO PULL

190
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:14,857
AMERICA OUT OF THE INCREDIBLY

191
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,858
FLAWED IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

192
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,659
IN A FEW WEEKS, U.S. SANCTIONS

193
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:21,663
AGAINST IRAN WILL BE REINSTATED,

194
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:22,965
LIKELY SQUEEZING THE ROGUE

195
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:23,565
NATION ECONOMICALLY AND

196
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:24,433
ESSENTIALLY IRAN WILL NOW HAVE

197
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,569
LESS MONEY TO FUND, LET'S SEE,

198
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,605
THEIR PROXY WARS IN SYRIA, IRAQ,

199
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:29,905
YEMEN.

200
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:33,842
THEY ARE FUNDING OF TERRORISM

201
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,177
AROUND THE WORLD, WEAPON SYSTEM

202
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:36,879
AIMED AT ISRAEL AND OTHER

203
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,880
ALLIES.

204
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,681
OF COURSE THE CORRUPT ISLAMIC

205
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:40,549
NEXT POLITICAL LEADERS IN IRAN

206
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,851
AND THE MULLAHS, THEY ARE NOT

207
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:43,685
TAKING THE SOIL.

208
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:44,319
PETULANT IRANIAN LAWMAKERS

209
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,456
YELLING ONCE AGAIN DEATH TO

210
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:49,057
AMERICA FROM THE PARLIAMENT

211
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:49,458
FLOOR.

212
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,059
EVEN BURNING AN AMERICAN FLAG.

213
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,662
AS YOU CAN SEE, IN OTHER WORDS,

214
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:54,430
A PRETTY NORMAL TUESDAY FROM THE

215
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,666
PARLIAMENT IN TEHRAN.

216
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,668
MEANWHILE, IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER

217
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:00,702
WENT ON A TOTALLY UNHINGED

218
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:03,705
TWITTER WRAPPED SAYING THE U.S.

219
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:04,673
PRESIDENT SHALLOW, LUDICROUS

220
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:05,674
BEHAVIOR WASN'T UNEXPECTED.

221
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:08,076
THE SAME BEHAVIOR EXISTED IN

222
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,878
PREVIOUS U.S. PRESIDENTS YET

223
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:11,046
IRANIAN NATION IS PERSISTING

224
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:14,116
WHILE FORMER U.S. PRESIDENTS

225
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,285
PASSED AWAY AND THE ISLAMIC

226
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:16,919
REPUBLIC OF IRAN IS STILL

227
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,286
STANDING.

228
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:20,122
THIS MAN CORPSE WILL ALSO BE

229
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:22,257
WORM FOOD WHILE THE IS LONGBOAT

230
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,459
REPUBLIC STAND STRONG.

231
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,060
COMING FROM A MAN

232
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,395
PRESIDENT OBAMA, THINK ABOUT

233
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:31,266
THIS, TRUSTED AND HANDED OVER

234
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:31,800
$150,000,000,000.02.

235
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,401
A PROMISE HE GOT BACK.

236
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,870
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD NUKES

237
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,106
BUT WE GOT HE GOT TO CONTINUE TO

238
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,075
SPIN THOSE CENTRIFUGES.

239
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:40,776
NATURALLY, THE MULLAHS OF IRAN

240
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,479
ARE THREATENING TO RAMP UP THE

241
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:44,480
URANIUM ENRICHMENT PROGRAM.

242
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,481
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT BOWING

243
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:48,450
DOWN TO THE EMPTY THREATS.

244
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,487
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF

245
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,188
IRAN STARTS UP THEIR NUCLEAR

246
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:53,522
PROGRAM?

247
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:54,456
>> THEY WILL FIND OUT.

248
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,891
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD DO

249
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:56,325
THAT.

250
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:57,593
I WOULD ADVISE IRAN NOT TO START

251
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:58,494
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

252
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,895
I WOULD ADVISE THEM VERY

253
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:00,262
STRONGLY.

254
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:05,434
IF THEY DO, THERE WILL BE VERY

255
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:05,968
SEVERE CONSEQUENCE.

256
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,669
>> Sean: SADLY, IRAN'S MORALLY

257
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:09,071
CORRUPT POLITICAL LEADERS AREN'T

258
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:10,672
THE ONLY ONES MELTING OUT OF THE

259
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:12,307
PRESIDENT'S DECISION.

260
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,408
YOUR VERY OWN MAINSTREAM MEDIA

261
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,177
THEY ARE ALSO IN FREAK OUT MODE

262
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:15,677
YET AGAIN.

263
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:17,913
I GUESS THEY DIDN'T LEARN FROM

264
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:18,580
THEIR NORTH KOREAN COVERAGE.

265
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,049
TAKE A LOOK.

266
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,751
>> DECISION BY THE PRESIDENT

267
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:25,854
THAT SOME SAY MARKS THE

268
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:26,855
UNITED STATES' BIGGEST

269
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:27,556
SELF-INFLICTED FOREIGN POLICY

270
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:28,190
WOUND SINCE THE IRAQ WAR.

271
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,892
>> WHAT WE HEARD WAS NOT FOREIGN

272
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:30,225
POLICY.

273
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:30,993
IT WAS VANDALISM.

274
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,796
>> DOESN'T THIS GIVE IRAN A

275
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:35,297
PROPAGANDA WIN?

276
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:35,998
>> OF COURSE.

277
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,367
>> I GUESS THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS

278
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,034
THAT JOHN BOLTON IS FINALLY

279
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:41,003
GETTING THE WAR HE HAS ALWAYS

280
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:41,336
WANTED.

281
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,205
>> REINFORCES THE NOTION THAT WE

282
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:43,906
ARE SOMETHING OF A ROGUE

283
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,808
COUNTRY, THAT WE DON'T UNDER OR

284
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,443
-- HONOR OR LIVE UP TO OUR

285
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:52,080
INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS >> IS

286
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,215
HE KEEPING A CAMPAIGN PROMISE

287
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,284
CUSTOMER DOES HE KNOW WHAT HE

288
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:55,717
PULLED OUT OF?

289
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,886
>> THE TOTALITY OF THIS

290
00:07:57,886 --> 00:07:58,487
PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR AND

291
00:07:58,487 --> 00:07:59,488
DECISIONS LEADS ME TO QUESTION

292
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:00,622
WHY HE DOES ANYTHING AND WHETHER

293
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:02,658
OR NOT IT IS TO DEFLECT FROM

294
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:03,125
SOMETHING ELSE.

295
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,593
I DON'T THINK HE HAS THE MORAL

296
00:08:04,593 --> 00:00:00,000
COMPASS TO MAKE A DECISION BASED
