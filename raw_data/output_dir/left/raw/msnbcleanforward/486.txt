a wealth of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

that for us given that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> entire</font>

00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:00,110
yeah we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in such an odd place because</font>

ordinarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> background investigate</font>

before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

310
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">nominated much less confirmed and so if</font>

311
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,880
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem they can be permitted</font>

312
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to kind of quietly go away and be told</font>

313
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,210
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> made the shortlist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

314
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,130
weren't the nominee instead what we have

315
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> odd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario where it's</font>

316
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,000
been we've had the very public<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing a</font>

317
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,190
demand for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an FBI investigation and I</font>

318
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,860
think there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be some desire</font>

319
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,990
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> accountability and transparency in</font>

320
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so it would be very unusual</font>

321
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">ordinarily that is not made public</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

322
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,590
think in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so much</font>

323
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,420
public interest in what the FBI found

324
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,320
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's gonna be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

325
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,690
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to keep it hidden</font>
