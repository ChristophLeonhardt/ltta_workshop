1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
Raila Odinga is not
your average politician.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,290
He’s the leading
opposition politician.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,480
Last year, he lost a
presidential election.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,230
But he’s been insisting
that the vote

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,160
he lost was rigged against him.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,150
“Our country Kenya
is in big trouble.”

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,870
Kenya’s Supreme Court
even agreed with him at first,

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,840
throwing out the
first election that we had

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,740
because it was fraudulent. When
it came to the second election,

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,900
Raila said the process
was still rigged

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,370
and he dropped out of the race.

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,020
His supporters
boycotted the poll,

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,650
and the president, Uhuru Kenyatta,
easily won a second term.

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,730
But it was a pretty
uneven victory.

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,440
“The elections were
the most peaceful

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,510
in our nation’s history.”

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,850
There was tension across
the country on voting day,

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,800
and things were so
bad in some places

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,690
that the polls
never even opened.

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,250
Nearly two million
Kenyans didn’t

21
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,130
get to cast a ballot because
their polling stations stayed

22
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,360
shut.

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,430
So Uhuru Kenyatta
won the election,

24
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,980
but it’s clear that
the country is divided.

25
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,570
What happened
today in Nairobi is

26
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,989
something that Raila’s supporters
have been preparing for months.

27
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,900
They wanted to gather in
Uhuru Park in central Nairobi

28
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,180
and hold an alternate
inauguration.

29
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,520
They said they were going
to swear Raila in as

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,980
“the people’s president.”

31
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,080
The government
called this treason,

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,730
but they let people pass.

33
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,980
Thousands and
thousands of people

34
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,170
went to the park
for the swearing-in.

35
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,120
The government had
disabled the equipment

36
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,820
for three private television
stations that were live

37
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,710
broadcasting the swearing-in.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,850
Across the country,

39
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,150
Kenyans experienced the first
peacetime media blackout

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,290
that many of them
could even remember.

41
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,020
Raila took an oath as
the people’s president,

42
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,630
although no one knows
exactly what that means.

43
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,700
He gave a short speech,
and he denounced what

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,490
he called electoral autocracy.

45
00:01:57,490 --> 00:00:00,000
Then he went home.
