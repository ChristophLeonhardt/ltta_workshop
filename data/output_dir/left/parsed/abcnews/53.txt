STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> GOOD MORNING.
WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR.
THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR TRAIN 
DERAILMENT SOUTH OF SEETHE L, 
ABOUT 40 MILES SOUTH.
AMTRAK TRAIN 501 DERAILED IN 
WASHINGTON STATE.
IT'S INTERSTATE 5, THE MAIN 
ARTERY CONNECTING CALIFORNIA TO 
WASHINGTON STATE.
TRAFFIC STOPPED IN BOTH 
DIRECTIONS.
I WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO MATT 
GUTMAN ON THE PHONE.
MATT, WHAT DO WE KNOW?
>> WE KNOW IT SEEMS TO BE A 
SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT.
LOCAL AFFILIATE SHOWING NUMEROUS
AMBULANCES AND PERSONNEL RUSHING
TO THE SCENE.
I 5 CONTINUES TO BE SHUT DOWN.
THESE IMAGES WE SEE OF THIS 
TRAIN CAR, ONE DANGLING OVER 
THIS BRIDGE.
THE SHERIFF SAID THEY'RE RUSHING
TO THE SCENE.
THERE ARE MANY PERSONNEL THERE 
TRYING TO ATTEND TO THE WOUNDED.
THERE ARE CASUALTIES.
IN ADDITION TO THAT PICTURE WE 
SEE OF THAT ONE CAR DANGLING 
OVER THE OVERPASS THERE ARE 
OTHER CARS THAT APPEAR TO BE 
DERAILED.
UNCLEAR WHERE THE INJURIES ARE 
OR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE 
CASUALTIES AT THIS EVENT. 
>> THERE WERE 75 PEOPLE ON THE 
TRAIN.
I WANT TO GO TO DAVID KERLEY.
>> THIS IS I 5 AND THE AMTRAK 
RUN THAT'S NORTH SOUTH BETWEEN 
VANCOUVER, SEATTLE AND PORTLAND.
A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN THIS AREA.
IT'S UNCLEAR -- THIS IS 
SUPPOSEDLY A NEW LOCK MOTIVE.
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE 
INAUGURAL TRIP.
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS 
DERAILED BY ITSELF OR IT HIT 
SOMETHING.
WE'VE SEEN CRASHES IN THE PAST A
TRAIN RAN INTO A TRUCK OR A 
VEHICLE CROSSING THERE.
TOO EARLY TO KNOW WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED WITH THIS AMTRAK TRAIN.
TO SEE A CAR LIKE THAT HANGING 
OVER THE BRIDGE ON TO ONE OF THE
BUSIEST PIECES OF REAL ESTATE IS
DRAMATIC. 
>> DAVID, AS YOU SAY IT'S A 
MAJOR, MAJOR ARTERY. 
>> YES.
MOST OF THE TRAFFIC IN THAT PART
OF THE COUNTRY IN THE NORTHWEST 
IS THIS NORTH SOUND CORRIDOR OF 
I 5.
THE TRAINS ARE GOING TO GO DOWN 
TO CALIFORNIA OR INTO VANCOUVER.
THIS IS THE LIFE LINE ALONG THE 
WEST COAST. 
>> THIS WAS A TRAIN THAT LEFT 
SEATTLE AROUND 6:00 A.M.
APPARENTLY THE INCIDENT HAPPENED
AROUND 8:01.
MATT GUTMAN EMERGENCY RESPONDERS
REPORTING TO THE SCENE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WE SEE THEM STREAMING IN THERE.
AMBULANCE AFTER AMBULANCE.
THEY'RE HAVING TO NAVIGATE 
THROUGH THE MASSIVE TRAFFIC JAM.
IT'S ALREADY MILES LONG.
WE HAVE UNDERSTAND THEY'RE AT 
THE SCENE.
I ASSUME THEY'RE DOING TRIAGE.
AS YOU AND DAVID MENTIONED, NOT 
ONLY IS THE I5 CORRIDOR FROM THE
BORDER OF MEXICO AND SAN DIEGO 
TO THE BORDER OF CANADA, BUT 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BUSIEST 
TIMES.
IT WAS THE ENTER SINTERSECTION  
MAJOR RAILROAD ROUTE IN THE 
NORTHWEST.
TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN 
THE CONFLUENCE OF ALL THESE 
PEOPLE AT ONE TIME.
I IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AND FOR MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO GET
THERE.
WE'RE SEEING NEW IMAGES COMING 
ACROSS NOW.
THERE APPEARS TO BE MEDICAL 
PERSONNEL TENDING TO WHAT SEEM 
TO BE WOUNDED OR AT LEAST 
WORKING ON WRECKAGE ON I5, 
WORKING ON DEBRIS FROM WHERE 
THAT TRAIN SEEMS TO BE DANGLING 
OFF THE OVERPASS.
WE SEE PEOPLE ABOVE THE TRAIN 
TRACK, ABOVE THE INTERSTATE AND 
ON THE INTERSTATE ITSELF.
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT EVENT.
THERE'S DOZENS OF AMBULANCES 
MOVING TO THE SCENE.
>> DAVID KERLEY SEVERAL 
INCIDENTS WITH TRAINS OVER THE 
PAST YEARS.
SOMETIMES OPERATOR ERROR, 
SOMETIMES PROBLEMS WITH THE 
TRAIN. 
>> ABSOLUTELY GEORGE.
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO BE 
TALKING ABOUT THIS.
IN THE PHILADELPHIA DERAILMENT 
BECAUSE THE ENGINEER WAS DRIVING
TOO FAST, THAT DERAILMENT WERE 
LESSONS LEARNED FOR AMTRAK AND 
REGULATORS THAT THE RAIL CARS 
WE'RE TRAVELING IN DON'T ALWAYS 
STAND UP TO THESE HIGH IMPACT 
ACCIDENTS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF CARS 
THIS TRAIN WAS CARRYING AND 
ROLLING DOWN THE RAILS.
THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING DID
WE LEARN OUR LESSON FROM 
PHILADELPHIA SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
HAVE THESE CARS BEEN IMPROVED?
>> DAVID, EXPLAIN WHAT KIND OF 
IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON TRAIN 
TRAVEL ACROSS THE NORTHWEST AT 
THIS TIME OF YEAR?
>> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY 
PROBLEMATIC.
IT WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH 
DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE RAILS 
BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED 
AT HOW QUICKLY THESE RAIL 
WORKERS AND RAIL COMPANIES DEAL 
WITH AN ACCIDENT LIKE THIS.
WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH THOSE 
POTENTIALLY INJURED IN THOSE 
CARS.
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CLEAR THE 
TRAIN PRETTY QUICKLY IF THERE'S 
NOT SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE RAILS.
IT COULD BE OPENED FAIRLY 
QUICKLY.
IF THERE'S SERIOUS DAMAGE, 
THAT'S PROBLEMATIC.
WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING ON THESE 
MAIN ARTERIES OF RAIL LINES 
THERE ARE OFTEN TWO OR THREE 
SETS.
CAN THEY MOVE SOME OF THE 
TRAFFIC OVER?
IT'S GOING TO BE A CONCERN.
WE'RE GETTING TO THE PEAK 
SEASON.
HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
TRAVEL HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS ON 
AMTRAK ALONG THAT ROUTE. 
>> WE SEE THAT CAR HANGING OFF 
THE OVERPASS, MATT, ON TO THE 
HIGHWAY.
ANY IDEA THE NUMBERS ON THE OVER
ALL TRAIN, WHETHER CARS SLAMMED 
INTO ANY PART OF THE TRAIN?
>> IT'S HARD TO TELL AT THIS 
POINT, GEORGE.
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME DEBRIS ON
THE ROADWAY.
I CAN'T TELL AT THIS POINT 
WHETHER IT IS VEHICLES OR BUSES.
IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE ONE OF 
THE RAIL CARS ACTUALLY CAREENED 
OFF THE TRACKS AND LANDED IN THE
I5 ROADWAY.
IT APPEARS SIGNIFICANTLY 
DAMAGED, PERHAPS EVEN FLIPPED 
OVER.
YOU SEE MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND 
FIRST RESPONDERS WORKING ON 
THAT.
THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY 
SIGNIFICANT CRASH.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO DERAIL THIS
TRAIN, THAT'S GOING TO COME 
SECOND.
FIRST FIGURING OUT HOW MANY 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT AND 
WHISKING THEM OFF TO SAFETY AND 
EVACUATE THEM TO HOSPITAL IF 
THAT'S POSSIBLE.
CLEARLY MEDICAL PERSONNEL ARE 
THERE.
THE SHERIFF IS ON IT.
THEY SET UP A MEDIA STAGING 
POINT.
THEY CREATED A PERIMETER AND 
TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.
UNCLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN AFFECTED.
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A MASS 
CAS
CAS
CASUALTY EVENT. 
>> DAVID THE NATIONAL 
TRANSPORTATION AND SAFETY BOARD 
WILL TAKE CONTROL OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> THEY WILL BE LAUNCHING A TEAM
TO INVESTIGATE.
THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM 
AMTRAK IS THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF 
THE INCIDENT OF THE TRAIN WHICH 
WAS RUNNING FROM SEATTLE TO 
PORTLAND.
IT SAYS THEY HAVE REPORT OF SOME
INJURIES.
AND SERVICE IS TEMPORARILY 
SUSPENDED.
IT SEEMS MORE SERIOUS THAN THE 
STATEMENT REFLECTS.
THE ANSWER THAT IS WILL COME OUT
OF THE INVESTIGATION ALL AIMED 
AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING
AGAIN. 
>> THE INCIDENTS WE'VE DEALT 
WITH HAVE BEEN ON THE EAST 
COAST.
THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR ON THE 
WEST COAST. 
>> THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ON THE 
WEST COAST AND MORE LIKE METRO 
TYPE REGIONAL CARRIERS HAVE HAD 
SOME ISSUES AS WELL.
RAIL TRAFFIC STILL CONSIDERABLY 
STAVE.
IT'S STILL SAFER TO GET ON A 
TRAIN THAN DRIVE AROUND IN YOUR 
CAR. 
>> MATT GUTMAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN 
ANYTHING TO INDICATE
THIS POINT, GEORGE.
ALL WE CAN SAY IS WHAT WE SEE 
AND REPEAT WHAT OFFICIALS ARE 
TELLING US.
THEY E'RE ON THE SCENE.
DOZENS OF AMBULANCES THERE.
IT APPEARS TO BE A PRETTY 
SIGNIFICANT CRASH.
THE PICTURES WE'RE SEEING IS 
THAT ONE RAIL CAR DANGLING OFF 
THE OVERPASS.
ANOTHER SEEMS TO HAVE CRASHES 
UNDERNEATH IT, FLIPPED OVER.
THERE ARE FIRST RESPONDERS ON 
THE SCENE AND LADDERS ON THE TOP
LEADING TO THE FLIPPED OVER RAIL
CAR.
ONE THAT DISTINGUISHES THE EAST 
COAST FROM WEST COAST.
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
CARGO, OIL, CHEMICALS MOVED 
AROUND AND TRANSPORTED.
THE EAST COAST ESPECIALLY THAT 
CORRIDOR IS WHERE PEOPLE TRAVEL.
THIS LINE NOT SOMETHING AS 
FREQUENTLY TRAVELLED.
WE ASSUME THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE
ON THIS TRAIN WHEN IT TRAVELLED.
IT SEEMS A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT.
WE'RE STARTING TO GET SOME NEW 
IMAGES.
SEE CARS LINED UP.
FLASHERS THERE.
THEY'RE INTERMINGLED WITH FIRST 
RESPONDERS RUSHING TO THE SCENE.
CARS HAVE TRIED TO MOVE TO THE 
SIDE TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR 
FIRST RESPONDERS TO GET THROUGH.
THIS IS I5 DURING RUSH HOUR.
IT'S A MAJOR CORRIDOR LEADING 
FROM THE BORDER WITH MEXICO TO 
THE BORDER WITH CANADA. 
>> WE'RE RIGHT NEAR TACO MA, 
WASHINGTON AND SEATTLE. 
>> DAVID KERLEY, WE CAN SEE 
AMTRAK CASS KADS.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
>> THAT'S THE SERVICE.
IT RUNS FROM VANCOUVER DOWN 
THROUGH SEATTLE AND PORTLAND AND
GOES THROUGH OTHER CITY NESS 
OREGON.
THE CASCADE MOUNTAINS RUN NORTH 
SOUTH.
THEY RUN THE WEST SIDE OF THE 
CASCADE MOUNTAINS.
GEORGE, IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO 
TALK ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY CAUSED 
THIS.
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, COULD IT
HAVE BEEN SOMETHING AT A 
CROSSING WE'RE NOT SEEING OR WAS
IT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WITH 
THE TRAIN GOING TOO FAST OR WAS 
IT SOMETHING WITH THE RAILS.
SO FAR FEDERAL OFFICIALS TELLING
US THEY HAVE NO INDICATION THIS 
COULD BE TERRORISM RELATED.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU JUST A COUPLE
WEEKS AGO WE DID A STORY ABOUT 
THE FACT THAT IN THE LATEST 
"INSPIRE" MAGAZINE FROM AL 
QUAEDA THE COVER STORY WAS 
SUGGESTING TERRORIST DERAIL 
TRAINS.
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SAID THEY 
HAVE NO INDICATION OF THIS.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT LOCAL, 
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, AMTRAK AND 
THE FREIGHT RAIL PEOPLE ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT.
WE HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED 
THOUSANDS MILES OF RAIL LINE 
MUCH IS UNSECURED AND SECURED, 
UNSECURED.
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE 
LOOKING AT. 
>> DAVID, THANKS.
I WANT TO BRING IN GREG MAKAI 
FROM WASHINGTON STATE ON THE 
PHONE.
>> I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK.
50 PRIOR TO GOING UNDER THE 
UNDARE PASS WE CAME TO A STOP 
TRYING TO AVOID COLLIDING INTO 
ONE ANOTHER.
WE SAW THE TRAIN CAME OFF THE 
TRACK ON TO THE FREEWAY HANGING 
THERE.
LOTS OF FOLKS INCLUDING A LOT OF
GOOD MILITARY PERSONNEL RAN TO 
TRY TO GIVE HELP BEFORE 
EMERGENCY REP ARRIVE. 
>> YOU DIDN'T SEE THE TRAIN COME
DOWN?
BY THE TIME YOU SAW WHAT 
HAPPENED THE TRAIN WAS DOWN?
>> RIGHT.
WE WERE FOCUSSED ON NOT RUNNING 
INTO ONE ANOTHER.
WHEN WE LOOKED UP, SMOKE 
EVERYWHERE.
EVERYONE WAS CURIOUS HAPPENED. 
>> COULD YOU SEE IF THERE WERE 
PASSENGERS ON THAT CAR THAT WAS 
HANGING OFF THE BRIDGE?
>> FROM WHERE I WAS, NO.
THERE'S NO WAY TO SEE IF 
ANYTHING WAS IN IT.
HONESTLY IT'S THE FIRST TIME 
I'VE EVER SEEN A PASSENGER TRAIN
ON THAT TRACK.
IT RUNS PARALLEL TO I5 GOING 
SOUTH THERE.
IT WAS A SURPRISE TO SEE IT.
THERE WAS NOBODY COMING OUT OF 
THE TRAIN AFTER THE INCIDENT. 
>> YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING 
BEFORE THE TRAIN CAME DOWN 
EITHER?
>> NO, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. 
>> HOW ABRUPTLY DID THIS ALL 
HAPPEN?
HOW ABRUPTLY DID YOU HAVE TO 
STOP?
>> IT WAS SLAMMING ON THE BREAKS
AND SWERVING TO THE SIDE OF THE 
ROAD TO AVOID ONE ANOTHER.
IT'S WET AND WINDY HERE TODAY IN
WASHINGTON. 
>> AS FAR AS YOU CAN TELL, WERE 
THERE ANY TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IN 
ADDITION TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH 
THE TRAIN?
>> NO, NOT FROM JUST NORMAL 
TRAFFIC OR ANYBODY TRYING TO 
STOP.
I THINK EVERYTHING -- THEY ACTED
PRETTY WELL TO AVOID ONE 
ANOTHER.
THE TRAIN DID APPEAR TO COME 
INTO CONTACT WITH VEHICLES ON 
THE FREEWAY. 
>> YOU SAID YOU SAW MILITARY 
RESPONDERS AND OTHERS RUSH 
QUICKLY TO THE SCENE.
WHAT EXACTLY WERE THEY DOING?
>> THEY WERE FOLKS THAT -- THEY 
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE JUST DONE 
WITH THEIR PHYSICAL MORNING.
THEY WERE IN THAT AYE TIRE.
THEY WERE GRABBING ANYTHING THEY
COULD, TOWELS, FIRST AID KITS.
I DID MY BEST TO STAY OUT OF THE
WAY.
I'M NOT SKILLED IN THAT MANNER. 
>> DID YOU SEE ANY INJURED ON 
THE GROUND?
>> I DIDN'T SEE ANY INJURED FROM
MY VANTAGE POINT WHEN I FIRST 
GOT THERE.
AS I WAS STUCK IN TRAFFIC DUE TO
THE EMERGENCY VEHICLES -- THEY 
WERE BRINGING FOLKS OUT ON 
STRETCHERS AND BACK BOARDS. 
>> SO YOU DEFINITELY SEE PEOPLE 
WHO WERE INJURED AND MAYBE 
SERIOUSLY BEING TAKEN FROM THE 
SCENE?
>> SABSOLUTELY. 
>> WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
>> THEY TURNED US AROUND AND 
HEADING HOME.
I'M ON MY HANDS FREE DEVICE. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION.
I WANT TO GO BACK TO DAVID.
DAVID, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE 
LEARNING IS THE TRAIN WAS 
RUNNING DOWN A NEW BYPASS.
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW FAST THE
TRAIN WAS GOING?
>> WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM 
FROM AM TRAM'S REAL TIME 
TRACKING IT WAS TRAVELING AT 81 
MILES AN HOUR.
DEPENDING ON THE PIECE OF TRACK 
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SPEEDING 
OR GOING OVER THE LIMIT.
SO THAT -- 
>> WHAT SPEED DO THEY GENERALLY 
TRAVEL AT?
>> BECAUSE THESE TRACKS -- YOU 
KNOW WE BUILT THESE TRACKS A 
LONG TIME AGO.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE CURVES AT 
TIMES YOU'VE SEEN IT, THERE ARE 
TIMES THEY HAVE TO SLOW DOWN 
BECAUSE OF CURVES.
IF THEY HAVE A STRAIGHT LINE 
THEY CAN GO 80 OR 90 MILES AN 
HOUR.
THAT DOESN'T SUGGEST IT WAS 
GOING TOO FAST.
GEORGE, YOU MENTIONED THE CASS 
KADS.
YOU CAN SEE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE 
AMTRAK RAIL CAR.
THE COLORING AND PAINT SCHEME IS
HARKENING BACK -- I'M USING SOME
OF MY OLD TIME MODEL TRAINS.
THOSE WERE THE COLORS USED FOR 
TRAINS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST 
100 YEARS AGO.
THIS IS A THROW BACK OF THIS 
SERVICE THAT RUNS ALONG THE CASS
KADS ON THE WEST SIDE BETWEEN 
PORTLAND AND UP TO VANCOUVER. 
>> THIS TRAIN LEFT SEATTLE AND 
WAS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE IN 
POR
PORTLAND AROUND 9:00 A.M.
I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 
THOMAS.
WE KNOW THE NATIONAL 
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD IS 
INVESTIGATING.
HAVE THE FBI PICKED UP ANY 
INFORMATION?
>> GEORGE, IT'S NOT UNUSUAL WHEN
THERE'S NO CLEAR CAUSE FOR THE 
FBI TO ASSIST THE NTSB TO TRY TO
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED, THE 
LEVEL OF THIS EVENT, THE FEDERAL
AUTHORITIES WILL BE CURIOUS TO 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WILL
OFFER SUPPORT, GEORGE. 
>> NO INDICATION YET THIS WAS 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN ACCIDENT.
NO INDICATION THERE WAS 
TERRORISM RELATED OR 
DELIBERATELY INSPIRED?
>> THAT'S CORRECT, GEORGE.
WE'LL CONTINUE TO CHECK WITH OUR
SOURCES THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WILL 
BE AVAILABLE IF NEEDED. 
>> AGAIN, A MAJOR TRAIN 
DERAILMENT.
TRAIN RUNNING FROM SEATTLE TO 
PORTLAND AMTRAK 501.
YOU SEE THAT CAR DANGLING OFF 
THE OVERPASS INTO THE HIGHWAY, 
I5 HIGHWAY.
TRAFFIC BACKED UP IN BOTH 
DIRECTIONS.
WE KNOW THERE ARE CASUALTIES.
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ON THE 
SCENE AS WELL.
WE'LL TRACK THIS ALL DAY LONG ON
ABC NEWS.

NEWS WITH DAVID MUIR.
