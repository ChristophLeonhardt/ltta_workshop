we know if some people may have come in and out of this meeting today and again it featured people from different sides of the solution debate on this issue take a listen I was there during the shooting and I'm a survivor and I want you guys all to emphasize the point that I survived I was lucky enough to come home from school unlike some of my other classmates and teachers and it's it's very scary and knowing that a lot of people did not have this opportunity to to be to be here still is mind-blowing it doesn't even seem real still everything seems fake I don't really I can't even I don't even know what's going on it's just crazy everything happening it's just so tragic I feel so bad for all of you cliff lost so many and I'm just begging for change we need to change there needs to be a significant change in this country because this has to never happen again people are dying and we have to stop this we have to stop it if he's not old enough to buy a drink to go and buy a beer he should not be able to buy a gun at 18 years old should have been one school shooting and we should have fixed it and I'm pissed because my daughter I'm not gonna see again she's not here she's not here she's in North Lauderdale like whatever it is King David Cemetery that's where I got to see my kid now motions pretty high yeah I'm pretty important probably for the president to hear that Oh most definitely and for the American people to hear that as well and for these people to be able to say it I mean were these young people who suddenly had to grow up a lot faster than they ever would have expected even though they've never known an environment in which school shootings are rare if not unheard of leaders will emerge from this now that that is this will galvanize them they will go forward many of them actually I think it's interesting have the benefit of they've never been politically engaged so they don't necessary really no there and they say just make it stop well that is they're just down to the very basics of it and they're beginning the conversation from that point that's unique I think from that from that point that you just made chain is it's important to note what happened yesterday in Florida when those students showed up and the legislature said we're not even gonna hear the bill we're not even gonna deal with that and their response to that was okay then this fall we gotta fire you we got to let you go and so does that translate into some type of political action that goes beyond the rhetoric we'll see but it goes back to my point about how I think the way adults respond to this the people who are the the movers and shakers of gun policy etc how they respond to this will animate where this goes next hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
