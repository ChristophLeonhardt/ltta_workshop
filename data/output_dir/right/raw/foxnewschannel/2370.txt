1
00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:03,801
SO NOW DONALD TRUMP HAS TWO

2
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:04,535
BLACK FRIENDS.

3
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:08,272
HE HAS -- I HOPE BEN CARSON

4
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:10,207
DOESN'T GET JEALOUS.

5
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:13,010
>> Sean: JOINING US RIGHT NOW,

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,211
DARRELL PARKS AND CANDICE OWENS

7
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:16,647
IS IN THE STUDIO.

8
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:17,848
SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU.

9
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:21,419
YOU ACTUALLY ARE PART OF THIS

10
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:21,819
STORY.

11
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:23,187
KANYE FIRST OFFENDED YOU.

12
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:24,622
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

13
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:27,058
APPARENTLY IT WAS MY BRAIN THAT

14
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:28,392
LAUNCHED THIS IDEALOGICAL CIVIL

15
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:29,927
WAR IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.

16
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:31,429
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

17
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,931
THIS IS A TREMENDOUS TIME TO BE

18
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:37,601
ALIVE AS A BLACK AMERICAN.

19
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:39,036
LIES THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

20
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:40,204
ORCHESTRATED BECAUSE THEY

21
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,473
CONSIDER US A LOW INFORMATION

22
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:43,040
VOTER MARKET.

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,242
SO THEY THINK WE'RE NOT GOING TO

24
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:46,677
RESEARCH THE STATS AND NEVER

25
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:47,111
FIND OUT.

26
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:49,814
>> Sean: THE RACE CARD IS PLAYED

27
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:50,815
EVERY YEAR.

28
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:52,083
DRIVES ME NUTS.

29
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,452
14 STATES, DARRELL, NOW HAVE

30
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:56,787
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, REGARD

31
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:57,054
LOW.

32
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,123
BLACK AMERICANS RECORD LOW.

33
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,325
HISPANIC AMERICANS, RECORD LOW.

34
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,994
WOMEN IN AMERICA, RECORD LOW.

35
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:07,498
UNEMPLOYMENT RECORDS, THAT IS

36
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:09,233
SINCE DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED

37
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,568
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

38
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:12,636
IS THAT GOOD FOR AMERICA?

39
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,972
OBAMA HAD EIGHT YEARS, 13

40
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:17,908
MILLION MORE AMERICANS OR FOOD

41
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:18,242
STAMPS.

42
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:19,743
EIGHT MORE MILLION AMERICANS IN

43
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:20,077
POVERTY.

44
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:23,647
THAT'S HIS LEGACY.

45
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:25,649
WHO IS DOING A BETTER JOB?

46
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:26,016
WHO?

47
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,251
>> FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW

48
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,219
HOW TRUMP CAN TAKE

49
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:28,986
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT

50
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:29,653
PROGRESS.

51
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:31,122
THAT STILL DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE

52
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:32,123
REAL ISSUE.

53
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:33,657
THE REAL ISSUE IS BLACK

54
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:36,260
AMERICANS ARE STILL HAVING GREAT

55
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,096
DIFFICULTY --

56
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,397
>> Sean: I WON'T STOP UNTIL

57
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:43,534
EVERY MAN AND WOMAN HAS A LIFE

58
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:51,976
AND TRAJECTORY AND JOB.

59
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:55,212
DID OBAMA FAIL WITH 13 MILLION

60
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:56,147
ON FOOD STAMPS?

61
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,915
>> HE DIDN'T FAIL AT ALL.

62
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:59,283
HE MADE BLACK AMERICA A FOCUS.

63
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:01,819
WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS PRESIDENT

64
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,853
TRUMP SHOW US THAT BLACK AMERICA

65
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:05,389
IS A PRIORITY FOR HIM AND HAVE

66
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:08,559
SPECIFICS HOW HE PLANS TO DO IT.

67
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,493
>> Sean: COMMENTS.

68
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:10,360
>> IT'S OKAY.

69
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,062
I LIKE WHEN THEY DO THIS.

70
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:14,398
JUST ADMIT THAT BLACKS ARE DOING

71
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:15,499
BETTER UNDER THE TRUMP

72
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:15,900
PRESIDENCY.

73
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,300
IT'S FINE.

74
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,437
IT'S THIS REFUSAL TO ADMIT IT

75
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:21,705
AND BLACKS WILL DO THE RESEARCH

76
00:02:21,705 --> 00:02:22,773
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

77
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:24,308
>> Sean: I HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED.

78
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:25,176
AL GORE.

79
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:26,377
THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO

80
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:29,313
COUNT YOU IN THE CENSUS OR THE

81
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:31,815
CHANGE IN TONE AND CADENCE

82
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:33,117
BEFORE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK

83
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:34,018
AMERICAN AUDIENCES.

84
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:38,189
I ALWAYS FELT IT WAS INSULTING.

85
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,058
BUT THE POLICIES, YOU KNOW --

86
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:45,029
LOOK AT WHAT KANYE SAID.

87
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:47,698
4,000 AMERICAN SOULS SLAUGHTERED

88
00:02:47,698 --> 00:02:48,933
IN CHICAGO.

89
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,901
WE ONCE SCROLLED THE NAMES.

90
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:54,238
WE HEARD ABOUT TRAYVON MARTIN,

91
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,372
WE HEARD ABOUT FERGUSON.

92
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:56,740
I SCROLLED THE NAMES.

93
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,176
WE NEVER HEARD OF THESE 4,000

94
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:00,110
PEOPLE SHOT AND KILLED.

95
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,011
>> Sean: BECAUSE CHICAGO IS RUN

96
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,913
BY DEMOCRATS.

97
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:04,014
THEY NEVER WANT TO HOLD THEIR

98
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:05,616
MAYOR UP.

99
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:05,916
4,000.

100
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,252
THAT'S THE EXACT SAME -- ABOUT

101
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:09,286
THE SAME NUMBER OF AMERICAN THAT

102
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,322
WERE SLAUGHTERED IN THE IRAQ

103
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:11,622
WAR.

104
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:12,356
IT'S A WAR ZONE.

105
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:13,757
TRUMP OFFERED TO SEND THE

106
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,492
NATIONAL GUARD AND THE DEMOCRATS

107
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:16,060
OPPOSED HIM.

108
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,995
SO WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO, TRUMP

109
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:20,097
IS TRYING TO BE EFFECTIVE THERE

110
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:22,132
AND WE HAVE SO MANY GREAT

111
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:22,933
RESULTS IN BLACK AMERICA --

112
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,301
>> Sean: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

113
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:24,635
DARRELL?

114
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:26,237
>> SEAN, LET ME SAY THIS THOUGH.

115
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:28,405
I WANT TO HEAR FROM MY PRESIDENT

116
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:29,773
TO TELL US THAT SOMETHING ABOUT

117
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:31,575
BLACK AMERICA IS A PRIORITY FOR

118
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:32,576
HIM TOMORROW.

119
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,578
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HIM FOCUS

120
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,113
ON MENTAL HEALTH, EDUCATION,

121
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:36,513
HEALTHCARE.

122
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:39,617
THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT HE CAN

123
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:40,517
HELP US --

124
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:44,455
>> Sean: OBAMACARE WORK OUT

125
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:45,689
GREAT FOR EVERYBODY.

126
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:46,156
>> I'D DID IT.

127
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,558
>> AND TRUMPS NUMBERS ARE BETTER

128
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:49,026
AND HE NEEDS MORE TIME IN OFFICE

129
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:50,928
TO CONTINUE TO DO AN AMAZING

130
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:51,195
JOB.

131
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:52,596
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ALMOST ABOARD

132
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:53,330
THE TRUMP TRAIN.

133
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,865
WORE AGREEING ON SOMETHING HERE.

134
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,333
>> LET ME SAY SOMETHING.

135
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,735
I WANT TO SEE TRUMP BE

136
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:58,135
SUCCESSFUL.

137
00:03:58,135 --> 00:03:59,036
THIS IS OUR COUNTRY.

138
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,938
I DON'T THINK HE'S FOCUSING ON

139
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,640
THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT BLACK

140
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:02,973
AMERICA.

141
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:03,774
I HOPE HE WOULD.

142
00:04:03,774 --> 00:04:06,010
>> SO YOU MUST AGREE THAT OBAMA

143
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,279
WAS NOT FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES

144
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,613
THAT AFFECTED BLACK AMERICA IF

145
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,582
YOU DON'T THINK TRUMP IS IN.

146
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:13,851
THE NUMBERS ARE IN AND BLACKS

147
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:17,154
ARE DOING BETTER UNDER HIS

148
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:17,620
ADMINISTRATION.

149
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,055
>> I LOVE PRESIDENT OBAMA.

150
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:20,958
WE SHOULDN'T SPEND MORE TIME

151
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:21,625
PUTTING HIM DOWN.

152
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,960
>> IT'S TIME TO SHOW THAT THINGS

153
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,594
ARE DIFFERENT.

154
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:25,996
FOR SO LONG THEY HAVE TOLD US

155
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,564
BECAUSE THERE WAS A BLACK

156
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:28,766
PROGRESSMENT PROGRESS.

157
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:29,933
PROGRESS IS NOT A SKIN TONE.

158
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,201
PROGRESS IS A NUMBER.

159
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:33,437
FOR SO LONG WE'VE BEEN

160
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:35,072
CONVINCED, LOOK, HE'S TAKING A

161
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:36,640
PHOTO OPEN WITH BEYONCE AND

162
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,074
JAY Z.

163
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:38,475
THAT MEANS NOTHING.

164
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:39,376
CHICAGO GOT WORSE WHILE OBAMA

165
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:41,512
WAS IN OFFICE AND HE CAME FROM

166
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:41,812
THERE.

167
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:43,681
YOU CAN'T DISPUTE THE FACTS

168
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:43,981
HERE.

169
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:45,849
>> Sean: IS THIS CULTURAL SHIFT?

170
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,451
>> WE'RE ON THE BRINK OF IT AND

171
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:49,553
I CAN TELL YOU IT'S GOING TO BE

172
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:50,054
AMAZING TO WATCH.

173
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:51,555
I'M SO HAPPY THAT IT STARTS WITH

174
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:52,656
A SINGLE TWEET.

175
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:54,725
I DID PREDICT IT.

176
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:55,859
KANYE WEST IS THE FIRST.

177
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:57,594
>> Sean: WHEN I INTERVIEWED YOU

178
00:04:57,594 --> 00:04:59,430
EARLIER IN THE WEEK.

179
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,633
IT'S GOING TO BE FUN TO WATCH

180
00:05:02,633 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU TRAJECTORY.
