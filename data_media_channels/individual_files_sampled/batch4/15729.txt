and here's the question if you can't even have a discussion about one of the most pressing issues of our times Islamic radicalism if you can't do so within the boundaries of official political establishments where will the people go where can people go to have a rational conversation if they're not allowed to do so in a parliament well maybe they start up single issue parties against immigration sounds unthinkable in Canada in the UK doesn't it well it's now the new normal in Eastern Europe joining us now via Skype to talk about this phenomenon is our friend dr. Daniel Pipes the president of the Middle East forum dr. Pym's great to see you again I wanted to show you that clip from Canada's Parliament Andrew shear is a very neat opponent of Muslim migration he would never say he's against it this wasn't even about Muslim migration it was about Isis terrorists and yet the government reply was to basically call him an Islamophobe what happens when that's the official response of the political establishment for a generation as it has been in Germany France in the UK well you just answered the question yourself people are gonna go elsewhere and then when they go elsewhere they're called far-right and neo Nazi you so it's of aims they're ostracized they might lose their jobs and on and on but people are going in that direction especially in Europe not selection of Australia New Zealand but very much so in Europe and most outstandingly so I might add in Austria there were just elections in October and the anti-immigrant faction one together 58 percent of the vote so I see this as a train that is booming and that is amiable the the consensus parties cannot prevail that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and we I'm a Premium Member you
