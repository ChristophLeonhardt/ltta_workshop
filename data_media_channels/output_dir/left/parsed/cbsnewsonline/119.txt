CONDITIONS ON BOARD. 
THIS BOAT MADE IT SAFELY TO 
SHORE. 
BUT IT'S THE OTHER BOAT THAT 
SINKS CAPTURED ON VIDEO MOMENTS 
BEFORE IT CAPSIZES. 
>> OH MY GOD. 
>> IT'S GOING UNDER. 
>> WE HAVE A REPORT OF A BOAT 
THAT'S SANK COMPLETELY. 
THEY HAVE LOST SIGHT OF IT. 
>> ANYBODY THAT CAN READ ME. 
I NEED A ROPE ON THE BOW. 
>> Reporter: SCRAMBLED TO GET 
THE 31 PASSENGERS OUT OF WATER. 
FIRST RESPONDERS CAN BE SEEN 
GIVING FIRST AID TO CHILDREN. 
RESCUE BOATS AND DIVE TEAMS 
SEARCHED LATE INTO THE NIGHT 
FOR SURVIVORS. 
>> WHETHER A STORM TODAY ON -- 
WHAT A STORM TODAY ON TABLE 
ROCK. 
>> Reporter: VIDEO SHOWS THE 
POWER OF THE STORM AROUND THE 
TIME THE BOAT SANK WIND GUSTS 
OF 63 MILES PER HOUR WERE 
REPORTED NEARBY. 
>> AGE IT WAS CAUSED BY THE 
WEATHER -- I BELIEVE IT WAS 
CAUSED BY THE WEATHER, YES. 
>> Reporter: THE STONE COUNTY 
SHERIFF DOUG RADDER SAYS THE 
SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS NOT OVER. 
>> WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE STILL 
MISSING, A CHALLENGING NIGHT 
TODAY AND TOMORROW. 
>> Reporter: IN THE STATEMENT 
THE COMPANY SAYS QUOTE OUR 
PRIORITIES ARE THE FAMILIES AND 
OUR EMPLOYEES RIGHT NOW. 
THE BOAT REMAINS AT THE BOTTOM 
OF THE LAKE. 
ANNE MARIE? 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> WELL, EARLIER JIM PARSON 
JR., THE PRESIDENT OF RIP LEE 
ENTERTAINMENT WHICH OWNS RIDE 
THE DUCKS SPOKE TO "CBS THIS 
MORNING" BY PHONE. 
HERE'S A BIT OF WHAT HAD TO SAY 
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US WHAT ARE YOU 
HEARING FROM YOUR TEAM ABOUT 
WHAT WENT WRONG? 
>> WELL, WE DON'T -- WE DON'T 
KNOW THAT. 
FIRST OF ALL IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
DEVASTATING AND OUR HEARTS AND 
PRAYERS GO OUT TO EVERYONE 
THAT'S BEEN AFFECTED. 
AND THIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN 
OPERATING FOR 47 YEARS. 
AND WE'VE NEVER HAD AN INCIDENT 
LIKE THIS OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO 
IT. 
BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE AND WE 
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF 
INFORMATION, RIGHT NOW, BUT 
THERE WAS A -- IT WAS A FAST-
MOVING STORM THAT CAME OUT OF 
BASICALLY NOWHERE IS THE VERBAL 
ANALYSIS I'VE GOT. 
BUT -- 
>> SHOULD THE BOAT HAVE BEEN ON 
THE WATER, MR. PATTERSON? 
WEREN'T THE WEATHER REPORTS 
CALLING FOR BAD WEATHER? 
>> WELL. 
NOT -- IT DIDN'T SHOW THAT. 
IT WAS APPARENTLY MOVING AT A 
HIGHER RATE OF SPEED FROM WHAT 
I KNOW AND I ON'T KNOW -- I 
DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS. 
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO 
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THE 
WATER IF -- IF WHAT HAPPENED 
HAPPENED. 
>> MR. PATTERSON, JOHN 
DICKERSON HERE. 
ALL RIGHT, DOES THE BOAT HAVE 
LIFE JACKETS ON IT? 
>> YES. 
>> ARE THE PASSENGERS REQUIRED 
TO WEAR THEM? 
>> NO. 
UNDER LAW THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED 
TO WEAR THEM. 
AND USUALLY THE LAKE IS VERY 
PLACID. 
AND IT'S NOT A LONG TOUR. 
THEY GO IN AND KIND OF ON 
AROUND THE ISLAND AND BACK. 
AND WE HAD OTHER BOATS IN THE 
WATER EARLIER. 
AND IT HAD BEEN A GREAT SORT OF 
CALM EXPERIENCE UP UNTIL THIS 
CAME VERY SUDDENLY. 
>> IF THE BOAT -- SHOULDN'T 
HAVE BEEN ON THE WATER, IS THIS 
THE KIND OF THING FOR WHICH THE 
PILOTS OF THE CAPTAINS -- OR 
THE CAPTAINS OF THE BOATS 
PREPARE AND TRAIN FOR THIS KIND 
OF EVENT? 
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND AGAIN, 47 
YEARS, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. 
THEY KNOW THE WATERS IN THE 
AREA, OUR CAPTAIN HAS 18 YEARS 
OF EXPERIENCE WITH -- 16 YEARS 
OF EXPERIENCE WITH US AND YOU 
KNOW THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RECORD. 
AGAIN THIS SEEMS TO BE SORT OF 
ALMOST A MICROSTORM EFFECT OF 
SOMETHING THAT NO ONE WAS 
EXPECTING TO HAPPEN TO WAY THAT 
IT DID. 
>> AGAIN WE ARE AWAITING A 
PRESS CONFERENCE BY EMERGENCY 
RESPONSE OFFICIALS AND THE 
STATE'S GOVERNOR MIKE PARSON. 
WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE'RE GOING 
TO BRING IT TO YOU LIVE. 
>>> IOWA IS ON THE ROAD TO 
RECOVERY TODAY AFTER TORNADOES 
RAVAGED THE STATE. 
TERRIFYING VIDEO SHOWS THE 
TWISTERS BARRELING ACROSS THE

>> Reporter: RESIDENTINGS HERE 
IN MARSHALL -- RESIDENTS HERE 
IN MARSHALLTOWN HAD ABOUT 45 
MINUTE WARNING THAT A TORNADO 
PACKING WINDS OF ABOUT 100 
MILES AN HOUR WAS APPROACHING. 
AND LOOKING AROUND TOWN THIS 
MORNING, IT'S A WONDER THAT NO

SPIRE RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF THE 
CLOCK TOWER. 
>> OOH. 
>> Reporter: THE TORNADO CARVED 
A PATH THROUGH MAIN STREET IN 
MARSHALLTOWN. 
ACROSS CENTRAL IOWA YESTERDAY,

HONEY, GET INSIDE. 
THERE JUST WENT A HOUSE. 
 
>> WOW. 
>> Reporter: IN ALTOONA A PAIR

TO REBUILD. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK 
STRONGER THAN EVER. 
>> Reporter: AS THE DUST 
SETTLED ELSEWHERE, RESIDENS 
EMERGED TO EVALUATE THE DAMAGE. 
CARS CRUSHED, BUILDINGS 
DESTROYED, STREETS LITTERED 
WITH DEBRIS. 
>> I KNOW A LOT OF BUSINESS 
OWNERS THAT ARE HERE ON MAIN 
STREET. 
THE BIKE SHOP LOST THEIR THIRD 
FLOOR. 
IT'S A DISASTER. 
>> RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THE 
ASSESSMENT STAGE. 
TRYING TO BLOCK OFF CRITICAL 
STREETS THAT ARE DAMAGED OR WE 
HAVE POWER LINES DOWN. 
SO WE'RE JUST OUT TRYING TO 
PROTECT PEOPLE AT THIS POINT. 
>> Reporter: CAPTAIN BRIAN 
BATTERSON OF THE MARSHALLTOWN 
POLICE DEPARTMENT. 
>> I'VE LIVED IN THE TOWN FOR 
25 PLUS YEARS AND NEVER SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. 
>> Reporter: THE CLEAN UP IS 
WELL UNDERWAY BUT POWER IS 
STILL OUT TO THE CITY OF 
27,000. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, THE AS PROMISED 
WE'RE TAKING YOU TO BRANSON, 
MISSOURI WHERE POLICE ARE 
UPDATING US ON LAST NIGHT 
DEADLY DUCK BOAT SINKING. 
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. 
>> THIS IS AN ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION AND WILL BE 
SOMEWHAT LIMITED ON WHAT WE CAN 
ANSWER. 
AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE 13 CONE 
FIRMED FATALITY -- CONFIRMED 
FATALITIES. 
WE HAVE DIVE TEAM RECOVERED TWO 
MORE BODIES LAST NIGHT. 
THE MISSOURI PATROL DIVE TEAM 
WENT BACK IN THE WATER THIS 
MORNING. 
TO TRY TO RECOVER THE FOUR THAT 
WE STILL HAVE MISSING. 
AGAIN, I SAID IT'S BEEN A LONG 
NIGHT. 
AND IT'S BEEN A VERY TRYING 
NIGHT AND PLEASE KEEP ALL OF 
OUR FAMILIES INVOLVED AND ALL 
OF OUR FIRST RESPONDSER 
PERSONNEL IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND 
PRAYERS -- RESPONDER PERSONNEL 
IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT FOR ALL OF 
MISSOURIANS TO KNOW OUR 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH 
THE FAMILIES AND THE VICTIMS IN 
THIS TRAGIC EVENT THAT'S 
OCCURRED DOWN HERE. 
NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT'S THE 
THINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN 
THE LAST 24 HOURS, ARE 
HEARTFELT. 
IT'S A SAD OCCASION, A LOT OF 
PEOPLE INVOLVED. 
A LOT OF FAMILIES INVOLVED WITH 
US HERE DOWN ON VACATION TRYING 
TO ENJOY TIME AND ENDS UP WITH 
A A AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS, THE 
ONE THING I WANT TO DO. 
I WANT TO THANK THE SHERIFF AND 
FIRST RESPONDERS AND I WANT TO 
THANK THE MISSOURI STATE 
HIGHWAY PATROL. 
THEIR DIVE TEAM THAT WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE OUT ON THE WATER 
AND ALL THE OTHER RESOURCES. 
THERE'S MULTIPLE AGENCIES HAVE 
COME TOGETHER TO TRY TO HELP 
WITH THIS TRAGIC EVENT. 
TO BRING SOME SORT OF 
CONCLUSION TO IT. 
NEEDLESS TO SAY, AGAIN, MYSELF 
AND THE FIRST LADY OUR THOUGHTS 
AND PRAYERS RIGHT NOW ARE WITH 
THESE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE 
HERE AND GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL 
WITH THIS TRAGEDY. 
WE AS A STATE WILL DO 
EVERYTHING WITHIN MY POWERS TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALL HAVE 
THE RESOURCES HERE THEY NEED. 
TO COME TO A CONCLUSION ON THIS 
INCIDENT. 
AND TO FINISH WITH THE 
INVESTIGATION OF THIS TRAGEDY. 
THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME 
OF IT WAS. 
AND WHAT THOSE RESULTS WILL BE. 
BUT RIGHT NOW, OUR MAIN FOCUS 
ALL OF US SHOULD BE AND ACROSS 
 
THOUGHTS AND OUR PRAYERS SHOULD 
BE WITH THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED. 
THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE OUT 
THERE. 
FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE IN THE 
HOSPITAL. 
AND FOR THE FAMILIES TO GET 
HERE SAFELY TO BE REUNITED WITH 
SOME OF THEIR MEMBERS THAT ARE 
HERE. 
SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO TURN 
IT BACK OVER TO THE SHERIFF TO 
LET HIM ANSWER SOME MORE 
QUESTIONS BUT THE MAIN THING I 
WANTED TO SAY THIS MORNING WAS 
THE STATE OF MISSOURI IS GOING 
TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR 
POWERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
HAVE THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO 
COMPLETE THIS AND TWO I AND ALL 
MISSOURIANS FOR THEIR THOUGHTS 
AND PRAYERS FOR THE FAMILIES 
AND VICTIMS OF THIS INCIDENT, 
THANK YOU. 
>> I ALSO WANTED TO THANK 
FAMILY PROPERTIES AND THE 
BRANSON BELL. 
THEY HAVE BENT OVER BACKWARDS 
HELPING US HERE ALONG THE 
CHATEAU. 
WE'VE HAD AN OUTPOURING OF LOVE 
AND SUPPORT FROM ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRY AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. 
I'LL DISPEL ANY RUMORS THAT THE 
FAMILY PROPERTY DOESN'T OWN THE 
DUCKS. 
I KNOW I'VE SEEN THAT ON SOME 
MEDIA OUTLETS BUT THEY DON'T 
OWN THE DUCKS. 
WE CAN DISPEL THAT RUMOR RIGHT 
NOW. 
WE'LL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. 
>> SHERIFF, BEEN TALKING WITH 
ME, YOU SAID THAT THEY'VE BEEN 
COOPERATING. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE 
CAUSE YET? 
>> AGAIN, IT'S TOO EARLY IN THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
THE COAST GUARD IS HERE 
INVESTIGATING AND NTSB WILL 
ALSO HAVE -- THEY'LL BE HELPING 
NTSB IN AN INVESTIGATION. 
THAT WILL BE UP TO THEM TO 
DECIDE. 
>> SHERIFF, THIS WAS A VERY 
LARGE STORM SYSTEM THAT CAME 
FROM THE NORTH. 
HICKORY, DID COUNTY AND THROUGH 
GREEN COUNTY AND DOWN TO STONE. 
DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THE CAPTAIN 
AND STAFF CHECKED THE FORECAST 
BEFORE SETTING OUT ON THE LAKE? 
>> I DO NOT HAVE ANY IDEA. 
>> DO YOU KNOW --  
THE SURVIVORS? 
>> I'M SORRY. 
>> WEREN'T TWO OF THE OWNERS 
SURVIVORS? 
>> OWNERS? 
>> YES, THE OPERATORS? 
OWNERS? 
>> THEY WERE NOT OWNERS. 
THERE WAS A CAPTAIN AND DRIVE 
THAT WAS ON THE -- DRIVER THAT 
WAS ON THE BOAT. 
>> ARE THEY SURVIVORS? 
>> THE CAPTAIN DID SURVIVE. 
>> DID THE DRIVER NOT SURVIVE? 
>> YES. 
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
ABILITIES THE VICTIMS IN. 
>> AS FAR AS -- ABOUT THE 
VICTIMS? 
>> AS FAR AS? 
>> AGE RANGE? 
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL 
WORKING WITH FAMILIES AND 
MAKING NOTIFICATIONS SO AT THIS 
TIME, I'M NOT GIVING THAT 
INFORMATION OUT. 
>> WHAT TIME DID THE BOAT GO IN 
THE WATER? 
>> THE FIRST CALL CAME IN TO 
OUR 911 CENTER AT 7:09 P.M. 
>> IN TROUBLE? 
>> I'M SORRY. 
>> THE CALL THAT THE BOAT WAS 
IN TROUBLE? 
>> ALL ILL SNOW THE FIRST CALL 
-- I KNOW IS THE FIRST CALL 
CAME INTO CENTRAL ABOUT THE 
BOAT GOING UNDERWATER. 
>> DO WE KNOW IF THEY TRIED TO 
RETRIEVE ANY SAFETY MEASURES, 
ANY LIFE JACKETS OR ANYTHING OF 
THE SORT? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
>> WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 
LIFE JACKETS TO BEGIN WITH? 
WERE THEY ON THE BOAT OR THE 
DOCK? 
>> WHAT I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS 
LIFE JACKETS IN THE DUCK. 
>> WAS ANYBODY WEARING THEM? 
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. 
>> HAVE YOU SPOKE TO ANY OTHER 
SURVIVORS ABOUT IT? 
>> I HAVE NOT. 
>> SAME FOR THE VICTIMS? 
>> AGAIN WE'RE EARLY IN THE 
INVESTIGATION AND I DON'T HAVE 
AN ANSWER TO THAT. 
>> MR. SHERIFF, WOULD YOU LIKE 
TO SEE ANY CHANGES TO THE LAWS 
FOR THE LIFE JACKETS WITH 
CHILDREN OR JUST HAVING THEM ON 
THERE IN CASE IT'S AN OPTION. 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE 
CHANGED? 
>> ONE COMMENT HERE. 
>>> THERE ARE A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS BEING ASKED HERE, I 
THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME 
TO KNOW THE DETAILS OF 
EVERYTHING THAT'S OCCURRED. 
THE SHERIFF, THE HIGHWAY 
PATROL, LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED 
TRYING TO ANSWER ALL THE 
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ARE ASKING 
THIS MORNING. 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO 
REALLY BE ABLE TO ANSWER THOSE 
QUESTIONS. 
ON THAT. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATUS 
OF ALL THE EVENTS YET. 
THAT'S STILL UNDER 
INVESTIGATION. 
NIL THAT INVESTIGATION IS 
COMPLETED I DON'T THINK IT'S MY 
PLACE OR ANYONE'S PLACE TO 
SPECULATE ALL THE THINGS THAT 
COULD HAVE HAPPENED OR WHY THEY 
HAPPENED. 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND OUT 
FOR SURE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
AND THEN BE ABLE TO RELEASE 
THAT AT SOME POINT. 
THAT WILL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY BUT 
TODAY IT'S JUST STILL EARLY AND 
THE SHERIFF AND HIS PEOPLE AND 
ALL THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME THAT'S 
BEEN WORKING YOU KNOW THEY'VE 
BEEN UP ON THIS THING FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
AND IT'S JUST MATTER OF 
BRINGING ALL THE DETAILS 
TOGETHER AT A POINT THAT WILL 
HAPPEN. 
>> PUBLIC RIGHT NOW? 
>> I'M SORRY. 
>> IS THE LAKE OPEN TO THE 
PUBLIC RIGHT NOW? 
>> YES THE LAKE IS OPEN TO THE 
PUBLIC. 
YES, SIR? 
>> YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS ALL 
HAPPENING --  
SOME OF THE HEROISM THAT 
HAPPENED THERE ON THE LAKE WHEN 
THE DUCK BOAT WENT DOWN. 
 
>> FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, I 
HAD A STONE COUNTY DEPUTY THAT 
WAS ON THE BRANSON BELL DOING 
OFF-DUTY SECURITY. 
HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE RESCUE, 
THERE WAS EMPLOYEES OF THE  
BRANSON BELL THAT JUMPED IN AND 
HELPED WITH RESCUE AND OWN 
PASSENGERS THAT WAS GETTING ON 
BRANSON BELL ASSISTED IN 
RESCUING PEOPLE. 
>> DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE -- 
 
>> YES, THAT IS VERY 
OUTSTANDING. 
AND AGAIN, I'LL TELL EVERYBODY 
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE 
WITH A VIDEO OF THIS, PLEASE 
SEND IT TO OUR STONE COUNTY 
SHERIFF'S OFFICE FACEBOOK PAGE. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO RETRIEVE ANY 
VIDEOS WE CAN OF THE INCIDENT 
THAT HAPPENED FOR OUR 
INVESTIGATION. 
AND FOR NTSB AND THE COAST 
GUARD'S INVESTIGATION. 
>> ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T ANSWER 
THE QUESTION, ARE YOU WONDERING 
WHETHER IT WAS AN OPERATOR OR 
DESIGN ERROR OR BECAUSE OF THE 
WEATHER? 
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. 
>> WERE THE WINDOWS OPEN 
ORACLED ON THE -- OR CLOSED ON 
THE BOAT? 
>> IT'S HARD TO TELL. 
I CAN'T TELL IN THE VIDEOS WE 
HAVE SEEN SO FAR. 
>> SHERIFF, DOES THE COMPANY 
THAT OWNS THE BOAT, STILL IN 
OPERATION TODAY? 
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
>> THEY WERE HERE LAST NIGHT 
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NIGHT WITH 
US. 
AND COOPERATING WITH ANYTHING 
WE NEEDED. 
SO I KNOW THEY'VE PUT OUT A 
PRESS TODAY TOO BUT I HAVEN'T 
SEEN IT SO I DON'T KNOW. 
>> SHERIFF --  
>> THE DIVERS HAVE LOCATED IT. 
THEY KNOW WHERE IT'S AT. 
IT WILL BE RECOVERED PROBABLY 
LATER TODAY. 
>> SHERIFF, WE'RE HERE HEARING 
A BRAN SON -- HEARING A BRANSON 
LEADER WAS ON THE BOAT AT THE 
TIME OF THE INCIDENT. 
CAN YOU CONFIRM OR DENY THAT? 
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
THAT. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE OFF-DUTY 
OFFICER OR DEPUTY THAT WAS ON 
THE BOAT AT THE TIME? 
>> WHAT ABOUT IT? 
>> IS HE A SURVIVOR? 
>> YEAH, HE WAS ON THE BRANSON 
BELL. 
NOT ON THE DUCK. 
HE WAS ON THE BRANSON BELL. 
AND JUMPED IN AND HELPED. 
>> WAS THE BOAT UPSIDE DOWN? 
>> I'LL TAKE ONE MORE QUESTION. 
 I BELIEVE -- YES. 
I BELIEVE IT'S IN ABOUT 80-FOOT 
OF WATER, IT LANDED I BELIEVE 
IN ABOUT 40-FOOT OF WATER AND 
ROLLED DOWN INTO 80-FOOT OF 
WATER. 
NO, IT'S ON THE -- [ INAUDIBLE 
] THIS IS LIKE I SAID NTSB WILL 
BE HERE SHORTLY. 
THE COAST GUARD AND HIGHWAY 
PATROL I MEAN THIS IS A HUGE 
JOINT INVESTIGATION BETWEEN ALL 
OF US. 
WE'RE JUST WORKING TOGETHER AT 
THIS TIME TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT 
EXACTLY WHAT DID HAPPEN. 
AND RECOVERY MODE FOR THE 
BODIES WE'RE STILL MISSING. 
>> MR. GOVERNOR WE KNOW THE 
PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT THIS 
SITUATION PROBABLY AN HOUR AGO. 
SOME KIND OF CONVERSATION HAVE 
YOU HAD WITH HIM? 
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE NOT SPOKEN 
TO THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY. 
WE DO KNOW HE KNOWS OF THE 
INCIDENT AND HAS BEEN BRIEFED. 
OUR STAFFS HAVE BEEN TALKING TO 
ONE ANOTHER. 
WE WERE TRAVELING IN THE 
SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE STATE 
YESTERDAY EVENING LATE. 
SO WE'VE BEEN IN TRAVEL HERE TO 
THE MORNING TO GET HERE. 
YOU KNOW, I GO BACK TO -- WHAT 
I SAID ORIGINALLY IN MY 
STATEMENT. 
RIGHT NOW, IT'S JUST A TIME FOR 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS, THERE'S A 
LOT OF HEALING HAS TO TAKE 
PLACE RIGHT NOW. 
AND RIGHT NOW, THAT'S THE 
STORY. 
THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE FACING. 
AND I KNOW EVERYONE WANTS TO 
KNOW THE DETAILS ALL THE 
DETAILS WILL COME IN TIME. 
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW, IT'S ABOUT 
REALLY TRYING TO PROTECT THE 
FAMILIES. 
TO UNITE THE FAMILIES CAN TO 
DEAL WITH THE SITUATION -- AND 
TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATIONS 
THEY'RE IN. 
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING 
HERE TODAY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> I WILL SAY I KNOW THAT 
YOU'LL STILL BE CALLING WITH 
QUESTIONS. 
YOU CAN CALL MY OFFICE AND 
LEAVE A MESSAGE AND I WILL TRY 
TO GET BACK TO YOU. 
I'VE BEEN OF COURSE OVERWHELMED 
WITH ALL OF YOU TRYING TO CALL 
AND GET AHOLD OF US. 
JASON PACE WITH THE MISSOURI 
HIGHWAY PATROL IS ALSO 
AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY 
QUESTIONS. 
SO YOU CAN TRY TO GET IN 
CONTACT WITH US IF YOU HAVE 
MORE QUESTIONS. 
BUT THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY. 
>> NEWS CONFERENCE THIS 
AFTERNOON? 
>> NOT THAT WE HAVE SCHEDULED 
YET, NO. 
>> THANK YOU EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>> FAMILY MEMBERS BEEN NOTIFIED 
OF ALL THE VICTIMS? 
>> ALL RIGHT WE JUST BEEN 
LISTENING TO -- WELL LET'S 
LISTEN IN A LITTLE BIT MORE. 
MAYBE. 
 
>> A LITTLE LAST-MINUTE STUFF 
THERE BUT WE'VE LISTEN 
LISTENING TO OFFICIALS IN 
BRANSON BRING US UP TO SPEED 
ABOUT THIS REALLY TRAGIC DUCK 
BOAT ACCIDENT. 
THE VIDEO IS JUST SO DISTURBING 
WHEN YOU SEE THIS DUCK BOAT 
TRYING TO FIGHT ITS WAY THROUGH 
THIS DEEP WATER IN TABLE ROCK 
LAKE. 
WE WANT TO BRING IN -- THERE'S 
THE VIDEO RIGHT THERE. 
THIS IS WHEN IT'S OBVIOUS TO 
OBSERVERS THAT THE DUCK BOAT IS 
STRUGGLING. 
THERE WAS A SECOND DUCK BOAT IN 
THE WATERS AS WELL. 
THAT BOAT MADE IT OUT. 
BUT THIS ONE DID NOT. 
AND IT RAPIDLY BEGINS TO SINK 
RIGHT HERE. 
CBS NEWS TRANSPORTATION 
CORRESPONDENT KRIS VAN CLEAVE 
IS IN WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW. 
YOU KNOW I'M WATCHING THE VIDEO 
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW TERRIBLE 
THE WEATHER IS. 
I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE 
OF THE ISSUES THAT'S BROUGHT 
UP. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATION HERE BY THE NTSB? 
>> Reporter: THE NTSB HAS 
LAUNCHED A GO TEAM. 
THEY'RE TEN ROUTE TO BRANSON. 
IT'S NOT ONE OF THE EASIER 
PLACES TO GET TO. 
THERE AREN'T A LOT OF DIRECT 
FLIGHTS FOR EXAMPLE. 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM A FEW 
HOURS TO GET ON THE GROUND AND 
WE EXPECT THEM THERE BY MID-
AFTERNOON EASTERN TIME AND THEN 
GET THE PRELIMINARY UPDATE 
SOMETIME LATE TONIGHT. 
ALTHOUGH PROBABLY WON'T LEARN A 
TON AT THIS POINT AS THE 
INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL GETTING 
ON SCENE. 
THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR WORKED ON 
THE EL FARO SINKING. 
VERY EXPERIENCED MIRE TIME 
INVESTIGATOR AND -- MARITIME 
INVESTIGATOR AND ESSENTIALLY 
THREE THINGS HERE. 
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED, MEANING 
THE OPERATOR OF THE DUCK BOAT 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THEIR 
DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO STAY 
ON THE WATER, WHAT WAS THEIR 
AWARENESS OF THE WEATHER. 
AND WHAT WAS FORECAST. 
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT 
MACHINERY. 
THE DUCK BOAT ITSELF. 
AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME 
BACKGROUND ABOUT DUCK BOATS 
HERE IN A MINUTE AND ALSO LOOK 
AT THE ENVIRONMENT. 
IN THIS CASE THE WEATHER. 
WHAT HAZARDS DID THE WEATHER 
POSE AND HOW WELL WAS THAT 
STORM FORECAST YOU KNOW AND 
SHOULD SOMEONE HAVE KNOWN THAT 
THAT STORM WAS GOING TO GET 
THAT SEVERE AS QUICKLY AS IT 
DID. 
ALSO GOING TO LOOK AT 
SURVIVALLABILITY FACTORS. 
WHAT ABOUT LIFE JACKETS AND WE 
HEARD THE OWNER OF THE DUCK 
BOAT SAY ON "CBS THIS MORNING" 
THAT LIAR JACKETS -- LIFE 
JACKETS WERE ON BOARD THE DUCK 
BOAT BUT PEOPLE BY LAW ARE NOT 
REQUIRED TO WEAR THEM IN 
MISSOURI. 
ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF DUCK 
BOATS IS THE MYRIAD OF FOLKS 
THAT REGULATE THEM. 
THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION 
SAFETY BOARD HAS JURISDICTION 
WHEN THEY'RE ON THE ROAD. 
THE COAST GUARD ON THE WATER. 
CITIES AND STATES HAVE THEIR 
OWN REGULATIONS. 
SO WOULD LIFE VESTS IF 
EVERYBODY HAD BEEN WEARING THEM 
MADE A DIFFERENCE? 
YOU KNOW THERE'S THE ENCLOSURE 
ON THE TOP OF THE DUCK BOAT. 
COULD THAT HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE 
FOR PEOPLE GETTING SNOUT THAT'S 
ALL THE STUFF -- OUT? 
THAT'S ALL THE STUFF THE 
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY 
BOARD WILL BE LOOKING AT. 
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL IN THE 
PAST 20 YEARS. 
SOME ON LAND AND SOME ON WATER. 
AND CERTAINLY THESE BOATS DO 
HAVE THEIR CRITICS. 
>> YEAH NOW YOU SAID YOU WERE 
GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT THEM. 
IF YOU LIVE IN SORT OF A BIG 
CITY WITH WATER AROUND IT. 
YOU PROBABLY HAVE ONE OF THESE 
DUCK BOATS TOURING TOURISTS 
AROUND THERE. 
AND AMPHIBIOUS AND DRIVE ON THE 
STREET AND THEN THEY ENTER INTO 
THE WATER. 
YOU ARE RIGHT. 
EVEN THOUGH THE OWNER OF THE 
DUCK BOAT SAID NOTHING LIKE 
THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE, 
MAYBE NOT YOU KNOW, IN 
MISSOURI, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY 
HAPPENED BEFORE IN OTHER 
CITIES. 
SOMETIMES MISHAPS ON THE WATER. 
SOMETIMES MISHAPS ON THE LAND. 
GIVE US AN IDEA OF JUST HOW 
THIS VEHICLE OPERATES. 
>> SURE. 
SO THE DUCK BOAT WAS BUILT IN 
THE 19 -- DESIGNED IN THE 19s. 
IT'S A WORLD WERE -- 1940s. 
IT WAS A WORLD WAR II PIECE OF 
MILITARY EQUIPMENT USED TO MOVE 
TROOPS ON THE GROUND AND ON 
WATER. 
THEY HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN SOME 
CASES EXPANDED SINCE THE YEARS 
SINCE. 
PRIMARILY AS TOUR BOATS TRUCKS 
IN THE U.S. THEY'RE VERY 
POPULAR. 
OU SEE THEM IN BOSTON AND YOU 
SEE THEM IN WASHINGTON, NEW 
YORK. 
HAWAII. 
AND YOU KNOW, SO THAT THEY ARE 
OLD EQUIPMENT. 
ONE OF THE CRITICISMS IS ON 
LAND, BECAUSE THE DRIVER IS 
12012 FEET OFF THE -- 10 TO 12 
FEET OFF THE BOW. 
THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF ACCIDENTS 
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO SEE. 
THEN IT'S HOW ARE THEY 
MAINTAINED? 
1999 THE HOT SPRINGS ARKANSAS 
SINKING OF A DUCK BOAT WHERE 13 
PEOPLE DIED. 
THAT WAS BLAMED ON INADEQUATE 
MAINTENANCE. 
2010 A DUCK BOAT STALLED ON THE 
DELAWARE RIVER IN PHILADELPHIA 
AND COLLIDED WITH A BARGE. 
THAT ACCIDENT WAS BLAMED ON THE 
TUG BOAT OPERATOR MATE THAT WAS 
PUSHING THE BARGE. 
HIS INATTENTION. 
BUT STILL TWO DIED IN THAT 
ACCIDENT. 
IN SAT UNTIL 2015 YOU REMEMBER 
ON LAND, A DUCK BOAT COLLIDED 
WITH A BUS ON A BRIDGE AFTER 
ITS AXLE BROKE. 
THE NTSB FOUND THAT THERE WAS A 
DEFECT IN THE AXLE IN SEATTLE. 
AND THE AXLE MANUFACTURER ENDED 
UP PAYING ABOUT $1 MILLION FINE 
FOR NOT REPORTING THAT 
PROPERLY. 
BUT FIVE PEOPLE DIED IN THAT 
ACCIDENT. 
BOSTON IN 2017. 
INCREASED THEIR REGULATIONS 
AROUND DUCK BOATS WHICH ARE 
VERY POPULAR IN BOSTON OF 
TORNADO WATCH FATAL -- OF TWO 
FATAL ACCIDENTS ON LAND. 
SO THERE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN 
ACCIDENTS THESE VEHICLES, THEY 
ARE UNIQUE WAYS TO TRANSPORT 
PEOPLE. 
AND THEIR DESIGN DATES BACK TO 
WORLD WAR II. 
>> RIGHT. 
KRIS VAN CLEAVE THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
ON THE PHONE WITH ME NOW IS 
FORMER NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION 
SAFETY BOARD CHAIRMAN AND CBS 
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MARK ROSENCUR. 
OKAY MARK YOU CAN WALKS THROUGH 
HOW THIS INVESTIGATION IS GOING 
TO PROCEED MOVING FORWARD. 
THIS IS A LARGE LAKE. 
WE HEARD THAT ONCE THIS BOAT 
SANK IT SORT OF SANK IN WATER 
THAT WAS ABOUT 40 FEET DEEP AND 
THEN IT ROLLED INTO 80-FOOT 
DEEP WATER. 
SO THIS IS A VERY DEEP, DEEP 
LAKE. 
SO GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT'S 
HAPPENING NOW. 
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOUR 
PEOPLE STILL MISSING. 
THIS HAS BECOME A RECOVERY 
OPERATION. 
NO LONGER A REST CUE OPERATION. 
>> -- RESCUE OPERATION. 
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND 
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THIS MANY 
PEOPLE DIE, OF COURSE THE NTSB 
WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE LEAD 
AGENCY HERE IN BEING SUPPORTED 
BY THE UNITED STATES COAST 
FORWARD AND THE LOCAL -- GUARD 
AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 
GET THAT VESSEL UP AS QUICKLY 
AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO BEGIN 
THEIR EXAMINATION. 
THEIR FORENSIC EXAMINATION. 
AND ALSO BE LOOKING AT 
MAINTENANCE, THEY'LL BE LOOKING 
AT SURVIVAL FACTORS AND THE 
WEATHER. 
ACCIDENTS ARE NEVER ONE THING. 
THEY'RE A COMBINATION OF EVENTS 
THAT LEAD TO A CATASTROPHIC 
ENDING. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING 
HERE. 
>> I THINK ANYBODY SEEING THE 
VIDEO WOULD BE STUNNED. 
PARTICULARLY THAT VIDEO WAS 
TAKEN ON CELL PHONE IN THE 
MIDST OF THE STORM WOULD BE 
STUNNED BY THE INTENSITY OF THE 
STORM AND THE FIRST QUESTION IS 
WHY WERE THEY IN THE WATER AT 
ALL? 
ARE THE CAM TAPES REQUIRED -- 
CAPTAINS REQUIRED OR ANYONE 
WHERE THE BOAT, REQUIRED TO 
CHECK -- WITH THE BOAT, 
REQUIRED TO CHECK THE FORECAST 
AHEAD OF TIME? 
>> ABSOLUTELY, THEY'RE WORKING 
ON LOOKING AT WEATHER AND 
THEY'RE WORKING ON DISPATCH AT 
THE FACILITY WHERE IN FACT 
THESE BOATS ARE BEING LAUNCHED. 
CLEARLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE A 
LOT -- THERE ARE GOING TO BE A 
LOT OF QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT 
WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE 
WEATHER AND WHEN THAT I HADDY 
KNOW ABOUT THE WEATHER -- DID 
THEY KNOW ABOUT THE WEATHER AND 
DID THEY CONTACT THE VESSEL 
WHEN IT WAS OUT? 
THOSE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE 
ANSWERED AND OF COURSE MANY 
OTHERS AS WELL. 
CERTIFICATION OF THE CAPTAIN 
AND THE CREW. 
THEY WILL ALSO LOOK AT THE 
CERTIFICATION OF THE VESSEL 
ITSELF. 
CLEARLY MAINTENANCE IS GOING TO 
BE LOOKED AT. 
THE RECORS ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE 
INVESTIGATORS. 
THE INVESTIGATOR IN CHARGE, 
HE'S A VERY SEASONED MARINE 
INVESTIGATOR AND HE WILL BE 
LEADING THIS TEAM WHICH WILL 
INCLUDE FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED 
IN LOOKING AT THE VESSEL 
ITSELF. 
AND SURVIVAL FACTORS OF COURSE 
GOING TO BE A MAJOR QUESTION 
THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED HERE 
AS WELL. 
>> MARK YOU KNOW, THE FORECAST 
-- ACCORDING TO AT LEAST 
OFFICIALS, WIN SPEEDS WERE 
ABOUT 63 MILES PER HOUR AT 
TIMES ON THIS LAKE. 
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE DESIGN OF 
THIS VEHICLE/BOAT, WHAT IT WAS 
DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN? 
COULD IT SUSTAIN 63-MILE-PER-
HOUR WIND GUSTS? 
>> WELL, THESE DEVICES WERE 
ACTUALLY CREATED ALMOST 77 
YEARS AGO. 
NEARLY -- EIGHT DECADES IF YOU 
WILL. 
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED 
AS KRIS SAID BY THE UNITED 
STATES ARMY TO BE COMBINATION 
AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLE THAT ENABLES 
IT TO OPERATE ON LAND, AND SEA. 
SO THEY WOULD FERRY THINGS LIKE 
AMMUNITION AND SUPPLIES AND 
EQUIPMENT FROM OFFSHORE SHIPS 
TO THE BEACHES. 
SO THEY WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN 
OCEAN TYPES OF CONDITIONS. 
BUT AGAIN, WHEN YOU GET INTO 
THE HIGH GUSTS OF WIND AND THE 
WAY THEY'VE BEEN REDESIGNED TO 
CARRY PASSENGERS, THE QUESTIONS 
ASKED ABOUT THEIR CAPABILITIES 
IN THESE TYPES OF WEATHER 
CONDITIONS. 
>> JUST ONE LAST QUESTION FOR 
YOU MARK. 
IS THERE SOMETHING EQUIVALENT 
TO A BLACK BOX ON BOARD A BOAT 
LIKE THIS? 
>> I DON'T FEEL THAT THEY HAVE 
WHAT WE CALL A -- FLIGHT DATA 
RECORD. 
THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT I 
BELIEVE FOR THAT TYPE OF 
VESSEL. 
BUT WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO PICK 
THIS VESSEL BACK UP, THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE 
CONDITION OF THE VESSEL. 
TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE 
TO IT. 
HOW THE WATER MAY HAVE GOTTEN 
IN IT LOOKED LIKE POTENTIALLY 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SWAMPED. 
WE JUST DON'T KNOW. 
THE QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED 
BY THE NTSB INVESTIGATORS BUT 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME. 
TYPICALLY A MAJOR INVESTIGATION 
TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR AND IN 
SOMETIMES 15 TO 18 MONTHS. 
>> ALL RIGHT, MARK ROSENCUR 
FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE NTSB, 
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. 
THE LATEST ON THIS MISSOURI 
DUCK BOAT SINKING. 
13 PEOPLE DEAD. 
FOUR PEOPLE STILL MISSING. 
WE KNOW THAT THE CAPTAIN OF 
THIS BOAT SURVIVED. 
BUT THE DRIVER DID NOT. 
THIS VEHICLE HAS BOTH A CAPTAIN 
AND A DRIVER. 
THERE WERE LIFE VESTS ON BOARD. 
BUT THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD, 
NOT REQUIRED BY LAW TO WEAR 
THEM. 
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK, MORE NEWS WHEN WE 
RETURN.
