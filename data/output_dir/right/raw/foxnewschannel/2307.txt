WE'RE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FACT

THAT PEOPLE GO TO CONGRESS AND

AS A LEGISLATOR IN OHIO I'VE

SAY I'M GOING TO DO.

66
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:39,885
LEGISLATING ISN'T QUITE AS EASY

67
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:41,120
AS CATCHING A FOOTBALL.

68
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,389
BEING THE BETTER CHOICE HAS TO

69
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:44,457
BE MY EXPERIENCE.

KNOW I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR THEM

89
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:19,492
