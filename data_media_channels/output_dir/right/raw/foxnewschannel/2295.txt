1
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:09,365
STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

2
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:15,605
MY NEXT GUEST MADE THE DECISION

3
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:20,510
AN APARTMENT WITH A BUS CARD AND

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,879
MONEY TRUSTING HE WOULD FIND HIS

5
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,913
OWN WAY HOME.

6
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:27,050
AFTER PUBLISHING HER STORY SHE

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,153
WAS HAILED AS A MOM THAT GAVE

8
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:32,387
HER KID INDEPENDENCE.

9
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,525
SHE WAS LABELED AS AMERICAS

10
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:36,659
WORSE MOM.

11
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:39,862
NOW THIS IS THE BASES OF A UTAH

12
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:40,129
LAW.

13
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:42,365
THIS WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO

14
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:44,600
WALK, RUN, BIKE TO AND FROM

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,902
SCHOOL, PLAY OUTSIDE AND STAY

16
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,437
HOME UNATTENDED.

17
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:49,439
STATE WELFARE OFFICERS CAN NO

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,574
LONGER TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM

19
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:53,710
THEIR PARENTS IF THEY ARE CAUGHT

20
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,813
DOING SUCH ACTIVITIES AS LONG AS

21
00:00:56,813 --> 00:01:00,550
THEY ARE CLOTHED, FED, AND CARED

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:00,817
FOR.

23
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:03,186
THIS IS THE FOUNDER OF FREE

24
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:11,060
RANGE KIDS.

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:21,170
I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:29,212
>> WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING

27
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:29,612
AGAINST.

28
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:33,316
FROM WHAT THAT SEE, EAT AND DO.

29
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:35,485
SOMEHOW WE HAVE COME TO BELIEVE

30
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:48,431
IF A KID IS WALKING DOWN THE

31
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:54,904
STREET IT'S ENSLAVING THE KID

32
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,205
AND MOM.

33
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,707
>> YOU KISSCRIBE A BIG CHANGE IN

34
00:01:57,707 --> 00:01:58,908
THE CULTURE.

35
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:02,545
HAVE THERE BEEN THINGS THAT THE

36
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:04,080
GOVERNMENT OR LAW -- LIKE

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,515
OFFICIAL WAYS THAT THE PROBLEM

38
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:08,418
HAS BEEN MADE WORSE.

39
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:11,020
>> YES, IF THE ASSUMPTION THAT A

40
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,955
CHILD ISN'T WITH AN ADULT THEY

41
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:16,893
ARE IN DANGER THAT MEANS ANYONE

42
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:19,362
THAT ALLOWS THE CHILD TO WALK

43
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:19,662
HOME.

44
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:22,632
I WALKED HOME AT AGE 5 AND MY

45
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,700
MOM WASN'T ARRESTED.

46
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:36,145
YOU GO AND ARREST THE MOM A

47
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:38,181
MOTHER LET HER KID STAY IN THE

48
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:41,417
CAR FOR A FEW MINUTES BECAUSE

49
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:49,792
SHE WENT IN THE GROCERY STORE.

50
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,395
WHEN THEY BELIEVE A CHILD IS

51
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:54,497
ENDAMAGERRED THEY ARE ALLOWED TO

52
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:56,065
INVESTIGATE THE PARENTS AND

53
00:02:56,065 --> 00:03:01,604
ARREST THE PARENTS WE HEARD

54
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:04,507
ABOUT THE 10-YEAR-OLD AND

55
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:05,808
6-YEAR-OLD, 10 YEARS OLD WAS THE

56
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:07,743
AGE OF MY CROSSING GUARD.

57
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:09,612
THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO WALK

58
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,280
HOME FROM THE LOCAL PARK IN

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,781
SILVER SPRING.

60
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:14,217
THERE IS THE CASE OF A WORKING

61
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:17,653
SINGLE MOM.

62
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:18,287
STEVE: OH, YES.

63
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:19,755
TERRIBLE STORY.

64
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,491
>> YEAH, IT WAS A TERRIBLE

65
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:21,791
STORY.

66
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,526
HER DAUGHTER WAS WITH HER

67
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:23,893
EVERYDAY.

68
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,428
SHE WORKED ALL OF THE TIME.

69
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:27,230
THE KID WAS OFF DURING THE

70
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:27,563
SUMMER.

71
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:30,366
SHE WOULD SIT AT MCDONALD'S

72
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:32,902
WHILE HER MOM WORKED A SHIFT.

73
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,937
HER COMPUTER WAS STOLEN AND

74
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,639
ASKED HER MOM HOW ABOUT I GO TO

75
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,811
THE SPINKLER PARK.

76
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:43,813
IT'S BOILING HOT, IT'S SOUTH

77
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:44,180
CAROLINA.

78
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,249
HER MOM SAID TAKE A PHONE.

79
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,451
IF YOU NEED ME, CALL.

80
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:51,988
THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW A WOMAN

81
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:54,023
SAID WHERE'S YOUR MOM.

82
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:59,061
SHE SAID MY MOM IS WORKING.

83
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,497
NOT ONLY WAS SHE ARRESTED AND

84
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:03,900
SPENT THE NIGHT IN JAIL.

85
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,736
HER CHILD WAS TAKEN AWAY FOR 17

86
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:09,071
DAYS FOR ENDANGERMENT.

87
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:13,209
IT'S NOT ENDANGERMENT TO SAY MY

88
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,945
KID IS OKAY TO PLAY IN THE PARK.

89
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:18,648
YOU CAN'T ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT

90
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:22,251
TO ALLOW PARENTS TO MAKE SAFE

91
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:22,618
DECISIONS.

92
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:23,419
STEVE: ABSOLUTELY, RIGHT.

93
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:25,254
I PUT MY CARDS ON THE TABLE.

94
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:27,156
I THINK YOU MIGHT JUST AGREE

95
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:28,057
WITH THIS.

96
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,359
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK?

97
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,395
>> I AGREE WITH EVERY BIT OF IT.

98
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,263
IF I WERE TO LIST THE PROBLEMS

99
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:36,866
WE HAVE IN SOCIETY TODAY IT'S A

100
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:39,468
LACK OF INDEPENDENCE AND

101
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:39,936
RESPONSIBILITY.

102
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,604
NOT JUST CHILDREN BUT WHEN YOU

103
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:43,439
GET TO COLLEGE AGE KIDS.

104
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,342
YOU DON'T GET THERE UNTIL YOU

105
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:49,879
GIVE KIDS INDEPENDENCE.

106
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,213
IS IT A RISK.

107
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:54,216
YOU WILL NEVER GROW UP THAT WAY.

108
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:57,653
ONE THING -- BEYOND JUST

109
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:58,054
CHILDREN.

110
00:04:58,054 --> 00:05:00,389
I'M AMAZED AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL,

111
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,026
THE DEGREE YOU SEE KIDS.

112
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:06,929
I READ A STORY A FEW WEEKS AGO

113
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:10,199
ABOUT THE PENN STATE OUTING CLUB

114
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,501
THAT'S BEEN SPONSORING OUTDOOR

115
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:12,835
EVENTS.

116
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:14,904
THEY SHUT IT DOWN BECAUSE GOING

117
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:18,674
OUTSIDE IS TOO DANGEROUS.

118
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:19,875
STEVE: I KNOW.

119
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,310
AN AMAZINGS STORY.

120
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,814
I WANT TO GET TEZLYN.

121
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:27,650
>> I'M THE MOTHER OF A

122
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,584
10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

123
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:30,920
I BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD BE

124
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,622
ALLOWED TO RAISE CHILDREN THE

125
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,023
WAY THEY WANT TO.

126
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:36,859
LIKE THE SPANKING ISSUE.

127
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:38,961
I WAS A LATCHKEY KID.

128
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:41,998
MY MOTHER WASN'T ON WELFARE.

129
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:44,233
WHEN I CAME HOME I WASN'T BY

130
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:44,567
MYSELF.

131
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,235
I LOCKED IF DOOR AND STAYED IN

132
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:47,269
THE HOUSE.

133
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,171
I'M NOT A FAN OF HAVING MY CHILD

134
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:52,108
IN PUBLIC PLACES BY MYSELF.

135
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:53,943
I'VE HAD THINGS HAPPEN TO ME AS

136
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:56,045
A CHILD AT 10 YEARS OLD.

137
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:58,280
I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT AN

138
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,648
ABDUCTION.

139
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:01,217
WHEN I LOOK AT PEDOPHILES AND

140
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,551
INAPPROPRIATE SITUATIONS THAT

141
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,353
HAPPENED WITH ME AS A CHILD

142
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:05,888
THAT'S WHAT I LOOK AT WHEN I

143
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,590
SEND MY LITTLE GIRL INTO THE

144
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,991
WORLD AND PUBLIC PLACE.

145
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,127
I BELIEVE EACH PARENTS HAS THE

146
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,129
RIGHT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

147
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:16,465
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DECIDE

148
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:18,901
WHAT'S ENDANGERMENT LIKE

149
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:20,369
CLOTHING OR STRUCTURE.

150
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:22,104
I WOULDN'T SEND MY CHILD ON THE

151
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,240
SUBWAY AND SEE IF YOU COULD GET

152
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,414
BACK AND HAVE TWO QUARTERS FOR A

153
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:33,816
NONEXISTENT PAY PHONE.

154
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,484
>> I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE UP TO

155
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:41,824
THE PARENT.

156
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,359
LENORE, I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT

157
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,761
THE LAW PASSED IN UTAH.

158
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:50,900
TELL US THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

159
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,068
THAT?

160
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,803
>> IT'S THE FREE PARENTING LAW.

161
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:55,538
THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR THE

162
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:58,674
GOVERNMENT TO GET INVOLVED IF A

163
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:01,711
CHILD -- IF THE PARENTS ARE NOT

164
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:03,012
DISREGARDING THEIR CHILD'S

165
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,146
SAFETY AND WELFARE.

166
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:05,848
IF THE KID IS WALKING TO SCHOOL

167
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:08,784
AND PLAYING OUTSIDE AND THEY GET

168
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:11,120
A 911 CALL WHETHER IT'S CHILD

169
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,521
PROTECTIVE SERVICES THEY WILL

170
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,790
SAY IF THE CHILD OKAY, THANK YOU

171
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,357
VERY MUCH.

172
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:17,660
THEY DON'T HAVE TO PROCEED.

173
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,529
THAT'S GREAT, I'M HAPPY CHILD

174
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,231
PROTECTIVE SERVICES EXIST AND

175
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:23,632
THE COPS ARE OUT THERE.

176
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:29,872
I WANT THEM TO INVESTIGATE CASES

177
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:32,608
THEY ARE LEFT IN A HOUSE WITH

178
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:38,714
DRUGS OR PIMPING OUT THE CHILD.

179
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,916
I THINK IT'S OKAY TO CALL THE

180
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,818
CHILD AND SAY I'LL BE LATE AND

181
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,754
DON'T SET THE PLACE ON FIRE.

182
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:47,456
WE DON'T ARREST PARENTS FOR

183
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,792
PUTTING THEM IN DANGER WHEN WE

184
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,193
DRIVE THEM.

185
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:54,530
CHILDREN DIE AS CAR PASSENGERS

186
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,631
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

187
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:57,767
WE CAN'T SAY IT'S SO SCARY OUT

188
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:00,503
THERE AND I'LL ARREST ANY PARENT

189
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:03,506
THAT ALLOWS THEIR CHILD TO PLAY

190

00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,669
SELF-GOVERNANCE THEN YOU WOULD

201

00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,351
I DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT

209
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:51,153
TELLING ME WHAT THE SITUATION

210
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:56,392
