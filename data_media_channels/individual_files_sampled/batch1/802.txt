a lot of the pictures we're seeing out of Iran are coming through social media no surprise there but it's the risk of rolling out this overused phrase Zara fake news is what we're seeing Evan take us through what you've been disseminating from all of this absolutely in fact come all the difficulty is that not many journalists can operate from within Iran so it's very difficult to verify what we're seeing on social media Plus telegram and Instagram just got recently booked this week making it a lot harder to communicate with Iranians of diverse opinions but my colleague Mir has been doing a bit of research and she's found some examples of videos that aren't quite what they seem now a video posted on New Year's Eve on Twitter allegedly shows the Iranian forces opening fire on protesters but it's actually from the 2009 Iranian protest and with a quick search online you'll find the same video posted on YouTube seven years ago in 2011 now one of the trending hashtags of the Iranian protest comes out of surgery BIA and with that a lot of Iran related content as well in fact this video is from the same date December the 31st Abdullah incident from Saudi Arabia tweeted saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guard ran over protesters but again this same video from 2009 had already been posted on YouTube a year later and take a look at this video it says it was filmed in December but these scenes are actually from the Arusha protests again in 2009 and here's a picture taken by Reuters you could see the same blue Gate motorbikes and burning rubble and the person who posted it actually posted it from California now another fake video doing the rounds on social media is won by a pro Israeli account and has had more than a thousand retweets it says the people of Iran are waking up but this is actually from a protest from the other side of the world Argentina and it was taken last month and if there's still doubt the people in the video are actually speaking in Spanish and one last example was this it was of an Iranian protest it says three hundred thousand people marched for democracy in Iran but as someone else pointed out Muhammad he says the demonstration is actually not in Iran it's actually in Bahrain and not in 2017 or 2018 but you can even see the Bahraini Flags being waived by the protesters in the streets now let's take a closer look at the accounts showing the fake content a lot of them are either supporting the u.s. Israel or Saudi Arabia where leaders of all three countries are public critics of Iran having threatened sanctions on the Iranian government now here's a tweet by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and he is wishing the Iranian people with what he called success in their noble quest for freedom so he's supporting the protesters there and also the US president Donald Trump in a tweet said the Iranian people are finally getting wise and in a New York Times interview the Saudi Crown Prince previously criticized Iran's supreme leader calling him the Hitler of the Middle East of course this isn't to say the protests haven't been violent in fact they have on both sides police and protesters and at least 20 people have died as kemal mentioned earlier but if you have any doubt on the authenticity of what you're seeing on social media then check the source the dates the location of the video or even the image that you're looking at you can do a simple reverse image search on Google if you're not sure look that up as well online and if you can't verify anything else then the simple thing to do is just don't share it but we want to hear from you today in search of us during the show I'm on Twitter and I'll respond to any of your comments
