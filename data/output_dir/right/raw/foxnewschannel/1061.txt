1
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:11,718
>> President Trump: WE HAVE A

2
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:14,287
MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH

3
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:15,421
ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY.

4
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,492
WE WILL STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT.

5
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:21,194
WE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON

6
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:22,929
CUTTING TARIFFS, AND WE'VE MADE

7
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,297
A LOT OF PROGRESS.

8
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:26,933
IT COULD BE THAT NAFTA WILL BE A

9
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:30,703
DIFFERENT FORM, IT WILL BE WITH

10
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:33,706
CANADA, WITH MEXICO, ONE ON ONE

11
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:34,741
MUCH SIMPLER AGREEMENT AND MUCH

12
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:35,174
EASIER TO DO.

13
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:37,510
>> Bret: A TRAIT IS THE BIG

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,213
TALK IN THE G7 SUMMIT IN CANADA

15
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:41,614
AND THEY ARE MEETING WITH

16
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:42,749
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER TO.

17
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:45,184
JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, THE

18
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:46,586
PRESIDENT MET WITH FRENCH

19
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:47,320
PRESIDENT MACRON WHO SPOKE ABOUT

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,988
THE TARIFFS THAT THE U.S. IS

21
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,991
IMPOSING SPECIFICALLY ON STEEL

22
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,694
AND ALUMINUM.

23
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:55,695
TRANSLATOR MACK THE FOUNDATION

24
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:57,497
WHICH HAS BEEN USED TO JUSTIFY

25
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:59,499
THESE MEASURES IN AN ATTEMPT TO

26
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:00,733
PRESENT THEM ACCORDING TO

27
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,835
COMMERCIAL LAW WAS AN ARGUMENT

28
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:03,703
OF NATIONAL SECURITY.

29
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:05,538
NOBODY WOULD THINK THAT THE

30
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:07,073
IMPORTS OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM

31
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:08,841
COMING FROM CANADA OR FRANCE OR

32
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:12,011
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WAS OF

33
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:13,112
A THREATENING NATURE.

34
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:14,480
>> Bret: SO WHERE DO WE GO

35
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,716
FROM HERE ON THE G7, AND WHAT'S

36
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:18,284
COMING OUT OF IT?

37
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:21,087
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL.

38
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:23,923
BYRON YORK, CHARLES LENA, AND

39
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:25,692
TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS

40
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,861
COFOUNDER AND PRESIDENT.

41
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:30,563
ALL RIGHT, THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A

42
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:33,299
NUMBER OF LEADERS THAT HAVE A

43
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,100
PROBLEM WITH THE TARIFF

44
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,735
SITUATION BUT THEY ARE TALKING

45
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:36,803
IT THROUGH, IT SEEMS.

46
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:37,904
>> THEY ARE.

47
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:39,772
I THINK THE FIRST THING TO NOTE

48
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:41,107
ABOUT THE SUMMIT IS THE

49
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:45,912
PRESIDENT SEEMS TOTALLY FOCUSED

50
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:46,913
ON NORTH KOREA.

51
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,681
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HE

52
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,516
SEEMS TOTALLY FOCUSED ON, BUT

53
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:52,919
THE BIGGER THING IS, THE

54
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,487
PRESIDENT IS SIMPLY INCAPABLE OF

55
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:56,089
ENGAGING IN THE DIPLOMATIC

56
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:57,690
NICETIES THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL

57
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,726
WITH, THAT YOU HAVE TO DO AT

58
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:00,226
THESE MEETINGS.

59
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:03,730
THEY NORMALLY GOVERN THESE

60
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,697
MEETINGS.

61
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:06,299
HE IS THE ANTI-DIPLOMAT.

62
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,767
LAST YEAR HE WAS PUSHING ON NATO

63
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:10,902
TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO THEIR

64
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:12,705
DEFENSE, NOW HE'S PUSHING OTHER

65
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:14,107
COUNTRIES ON TRADE TO GET THE

66
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:15,908
UNITED STATES A BETTER DEAL.

67
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:17,810
HIS THEME IS ALWAYS, THAT OTHER

68
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,246
COUNTRIES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE

69
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:21,948
OF THE BIG, RICH, UNITED STATES.

70
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,484
IN THE END, HE WILL GET A LITTLE

71
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:32,325
BIT OF WHAT HE'S ASKING FOR.

72
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:32,992
>> Bret: AT THE OTHER THING

73
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:33,760
IS, HE'S STIRRING THE POT BEFORE

74
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,360
LEAVING FOR THE SUMMIT.

75
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,094
HE SAID THIS ABOUT HAVING RUSSIA

76
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:38,898
BACK IN.

77
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:40,299
>> President Trump: I HAVE

78
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,003
BEEN RUSSIA'S FIRST       WORSTN

79
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:44,036
BEEN RUSSIA'S FIRST       WORSTG

80
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:44,070
BEEN RUSSIA'S FIRST       WORSTT

81
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,103
BEEN RUSSIA'S FIRST       WORSTA

82
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:44,137
BEEN RUSSIA'S FIRST       WORSTE

83
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:44,504
BEEN RUSSIA'S FIRST       WORST.

84
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,706
THAT BEING SAID, WHY ARE WE

85
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:48,107
HAVING A MEETING WITHOUT RUSSIA?

86
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:49,709
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, AND

87
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,110
IT MAY NOT BE POLITICALLY

88
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,079
CORRECT, BUT WE HAVE A WORLD TO

89
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,713
RUN.

90
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:57,550
WE SHOULD HAVE RUSSIA AT THE

91
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,117
NEGOTIATING TABLE.

92
00:02:58,117 --> 00:02:58,818
>> Bret: CHUCK?

93
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:00,887
>> THERE IS SO MUCH TO COMMENT

94
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,122
ON IN THAT ONE LITTLE STATEMENT.

95
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:05,525
RUSSIA WAS CAST OUT OF WHAT WAS

96
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,927
THEN THE G8 AND PUNISHMENT FOR

97
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,328
AN EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OF

98
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:11,731
INTERNATIONAL LAW, THAT IS THE

99
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,734
SEIZURE OF CRIMEA IN 2014.

100
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:15,902
MOST RECENTLY, THEY VIOLATED

101
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:17,003
INTERNATIONAL LAW AGAIN BY

102
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:19,372
ATTEMPTING TO ASSASSINATE TO

103
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:23,442
PEOPLE WITHIN BRITAIN, AND IN

104
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:24,710
THE UNITED STATES ITSELF

105
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,378
PARTICIPATED IN COLLECTIVE

106
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:27,346
RETALIATION SANCTIONS BASED ON

107
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:28,714
THAT.

108
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:30,116
SO, FOR THE PRESIDENT TO SOUND

109
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,450
THIS NOTE OF URGENCY, THAT WE

110
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,819
HAVE TO GET RUSSIA BACK IN THE

111
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,320
ROOM SO WE CAN RUN THE WORLD

112
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,389
TOGETHER IS JUST AT ODDS WITH

113
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,924
ALL OF THAT RECENT HISTORY.

114
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:40,326
AND I'M SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN

115
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:41,594
VERY PUZZLING AND DISMAYING TO

116
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:42,929
THESE TRADITIONAL WESTERN ALLIES

117
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:43,896
WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

118
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:48,501
WHAT EXACTLY IT IS THAT HE IS

119
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:54,106
DRIVING AT.

120
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,975
AND IN SOME CASES THAT CAN BE

121
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:56,709
USEFUL.

122
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,711
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE

123
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,913
A BOTTOM LINE AT SOME POINT.

124
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:02,215
I THINK WHAT THESE OTHER

125
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:03,850
COUNTRIES FIND IT SO BAFFLING

126
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,319
AND ULTIMATELY FRUSTRATING IS,

127
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,753
IS HEADING UP A SITUATION IN

128
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:09,188
WHICH THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN GIVE

129
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:11,958
HIM WHAT HE WANTS AT THE END IS

130
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,326
TO BE HUMILIATED BY HIM.

131
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,127
IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S MAKING

132
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,295
THESE OPEN-ENDED DEMANDS IN SUCH

133
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,197
A TONE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO SAY

134
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:20,166
YES IS TO ACCEPT YOUR OWN

135
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,767
HUMILIATION, AND I'M NOT SURE

136
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:25,938
THAT WILL LEAD ANYWHERE.

137
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:26,939
>> Bret: TOM?

138
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,108
>> I THINK CHUCK AND BYRON ARE

139
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:29,508
BOTH RIGHT.

140
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:30,776
ONE THING PEOPLE LIKED ABOUT

141
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,144
TRUMP IS THAT HE IS A FIGHTER,

142
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:34,313
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THERE IS

143
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:35,414
WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT ON THE FACT

144
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:37,116
THAT SOME OF THESE TRADE DEALS

145
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,151
ARE UNFAIR TO THE UNITED STATES.

146
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:40,486
EVEN BUSINESS LEADERS WILL TELL

147
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:43,522
YOU THAT, AND THE NEED TO BE

148
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:44,323
RECALIBRATED AND RENEGOTIATED.

149
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:46,592
THEY ALSO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE

150
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:47,793
STYLE IN WHICH TRUMP IS DOING

151
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:51,097
IT, AND SOME OF THE TACTICS THAT

152
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:51,497
HE'S USING.

153
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:53,699
SO THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM.

154
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,302
HE IS CERTAINLY NOW IN FULL

155
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:58,571
HONEY BADGER MODE AND HE'S

156
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,105
ATTACKING EVERYBODY.

157
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:00,373
WE WILL SEE WHERE THAT ENDS UP

158
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:00,940
BLEEDING.

159
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,909
I THINK HE WILL END UP GETTING

160
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:04,143
SOMETHING, AND BE ABLE TO

161
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:06,078
DECLARE SOME SORT OF VICTORY,

162
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:07,847
BUT I THINK HE HAS CERTAINLY PUT

163
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:09,749
THE REST OF THE WORLD ON NOTICE

164
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:11,217
THAT HE'S NOT MESSING AROUND

165
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:14,720
WHEN IT COMES TO RENEGOTIATING

166
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,321
THESE TRADE DEALS.

167
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:17,556
>> Bret: I LIKE THAT, FULL

168
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:18,124
HONEY BADGER MODE.

169
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:20,760
HE IS THE FIGURE THERE AS FAR AS

170
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,396
MAKING HEADLINES, BUT AS YOU

171
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,331
LOOK AT THE GDP OF THESE

172
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,699
COUNTRIES AND COMPARE THEM

173
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,768
COLLECTIVELY, THEY DON'T ADD UP

174
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:31,137
TO WHAT THE GDP OF THE

175
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:31,637
UNITED STATES IS.

176
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,073
SO THAT TELLS YOU A LITTLE BIT

177
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:38,711
ABOUT HOW THIS IS ALL GOING

178
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:39,745
DOWN, BYRON.

179
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:41,347
>> IT DOES, EVERYTHING IN THE

180
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:42,915
UNITED STATES HAS A GREATER

181
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:45,551
EMPHASIS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

182
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,320
SO TRUMP HERE AGAIN WILL COME

183
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,554
AWAY WITH SOMETHING.

184
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:51,123
THE TALK HE DID TODAY ABOUT

185
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:52,591
RENEGOTIATING NAFTA SO IT WOULD

186
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:53,993
NOT BE PAYING A NORTH AMERICAN

187
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:55,761
AGREEMENT, IT WOULD BE A

188
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:57,363
ONE-ON-ONE AGREEMENT BETWEEN

189
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:58,631
UNITED STATES AND CANADA WERE

190
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:00,232
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND

191
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,668
MEXICO SHOWS THAT HE'S ACTUALLY

192
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:03,970
THINKING ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY

193
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,371
RESTRUCTURING SOME OF THESE

194
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:06,172
AGREEMENTS.

195
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,074
AND BECAUSE OF THOSE GDP FIGURES

196
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:09,342
THAT YOU JUST SHOWED A COME OF

197
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:10,977
THE OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE

198
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:13,212
ANY OTHER CHOICE BUT TO

199
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:14,814
NEGOTIATE WITH THEM.

200
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:15,881
>> Bret: AS OF THIS

201
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:17,583
NEGOTIATION IS ONGOING, BUT HE'S

202
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,551
GETTING READY FOR ANOTHER ONE.

203
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,287
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE

204
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:21,988
FRIDAY LIGHTNING ROUND, TALK.

205
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,089
BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF BIG

206
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:26,125
MOMENTS FOR THIS PRESIDENT AT

207
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,892
THIS TIME.

208
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:28,127
>> Chuck: YES, AND JUST TO

209
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:30,396
COME BACK TO WHAT BYRON SAID IT,

210
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:31,931
NO OTHER CHOICE.

211
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:33,733
IN OTHER WORDS, YES THE

212
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,433
UNITED STATES HAS TREMENDOUS

213
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:34,934
LEVERAGE.

214
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:35,935
WE ARE THE BIGGEST ECONOMY BY

215
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:37,136
FAR END OF THE END OF THE DAY

216
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:38,938
THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH US.

217
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:40,539
BUT WHAT IS SO CONCERNED ABOUT

218
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,141
THIS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT, THAT

219
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:42,942
HAD NOT BEEN THE BASIS ON WHICH

220
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:45,144
WE HAVE DEALT WITH THESE

221
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:47,380
PARTICULAR COUNTRIES OVER TIME.

222
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,981
THAT, YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

223
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:51,150
IT'S MUCH MORE A QUESTION OF

224
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,918
MUTUAL INTEREST AND MUTUAL

225
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,520
VALUES, AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT

226
00:06:54,520 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK THEY FIND SO BAFFLING
