>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECS S 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR RIGHT 
NOW BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ABOUT TO MAKE A MAJOR 
ANNOUNCEMENT ON TRADE IMPOSING 
STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS.
YOU SEE HIM GREETING STEEL 
WORKERS FROM PITTSBURGH.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY.
I'M HONORED TO BE WITH OUR 
INCREDIBLE STEEL AND ALUMINUM 
WORKERS.
AND YOU ARE TRULY THE BACKBONE 
OF AMERICA.
YOU KNOW THAT.
VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE.
I'VE KNOWN YOU AND PEOPLE THAT 
ARE VERY CLOSELY RELATED YOU TO 
FOR A LONG TIME.
YOU KNOW THAT.
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE REASON
I'M HERE.
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK SECRETARY 
MNUCHIN, AMBASSADOR LIGHT 
HOUSER, PETER NAVARRO, MIKE 
PENCE, OUR GREAT VICE PRESIDENT.
THEY'VE WORKED SO HARD ON 
GETTING THIS GOING AND GETTING 
IT DONE.
AND PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO 
REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.
WE HAVE TO PROTECT AND BUILD OUR
STEEL AND ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES.
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SHOWING 
GREAT FLEXIBILITY AND 
COOPERATION TOWARD THOSE THAT 
ARE REALLY FRIENDS OF OURS, BOTH
ON A TRADE BASIS AND A MILITARY 
BASIS.
A STRONG STEEL AND ALUMINUM 
INDUSTRY ARE VITAL TO OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY, ABSOLUTELY 
VITAL.
STEEL IS STEEL.
YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T 
HAVE A COUNTRY.
OUR INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN 
TARGETED FOR YEARS AND YEARS, 
DECADES, IN FACT, BY UNFAIR 
FOREIGN TRADE PRACTICES LEADING 
TO THE SHUTTERED PLANTS AND 
MILLS.
THE LAYING OFF OF MILLIONS OF 
WORKERS, AND THE DECIMATION OF 
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES.
AND THAT'S GOING TO STOP, RIGHT?
IT'S GOING TO STOP.
THIS IS NOT MERELY AN ECONOMIC 
DISASTER, BUT IT'S A SECURITY 
DISASTER.
WE WANT TO BUILD OUR SHIPS.
WE WANT TO BUILD OUR PLANES, WE 
WANT TO BUILD OUR MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT WITH STEEL, WITH 
ALUMINUM FROM OUR COUNTRY.
AND NOW WE'RE FINALLY TAKING 
ACTION TO CORRECT THIS 
LONG-OVERDUE PROBLEM.
IT'S A TRAVESTY.
I'M DEFENDING AMERICA'S NATIONAL
SECURITY BY PLACING TARIFFS ON 
FOREIGN IMPORTS OF STEEL AND 
ALUMINUM.
WE WILL HAVE A 25% TARIFF ON 
FOREIGN STEEL AND A 10% TARIFF 
ON FOREIGN ALUMINUM.
WHEN THE PRODUCT COMES ACROSS 
OUR BORDERS.
IT'S A PROCESS CALLED DUMPING.
AND THEY DUMPED AT ANY TIME ON 
ANY NATION ANYWHERE IN THE 
WORLD, AND IT DROVE OUR PLANTS 
OUT OF BUSINESS.
IT DROVE OUR AFFECTS OUT OF 
BUSINESS.
AND WE WANT A LOT OF STEEL 
COMING IN TO OUR COUNTRY, BUT WE
WANT IT TO BE FAIR AND WE WANT 
OUR WORKERS TO BE PROTECTED, 
EXCEPT, FRANKLY, OUR COMPANIES 
TO BE PROTECTED .
BY CONTRAST WE WILL NOT PLACE 
ANY NEW TAX ON PRODUCT MADE IN 
THE USA.
SO THERE'S NO TAX IF A PRODUCT 
IS MADE IN THE USA.
YOU DON'T WANT TO THE PAY TAX, 
BRING YOUR PLANT TO THE USA.
THERE'S NO TAX, WHICH WILL WE 
WILL BENEFIT FROM THE MASSIVE 
TAX CUTS WE HAVE IN PLACE.
WE HAVE PASSED THE LARGEST TAX 
CUT PLAN IN THE COUNTRY'S 
HISTORY.
AND THAT HAS CAUSED REALLY 
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS BETWEEN THAT 
AND REGULATION CUTTING, AND I 
THINK MAYBE REGULATION CUTTING 
EVERY BIT AS MUCH.
AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO ON 
REGULATIONS, BUT WE'VE CUT MORE 
THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IN 
HISTORY SO WE'RE URGING ALL 
COMPANIES TO BUY AMERICAN.
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT, BUY 
AMERICAN.
THE ACTION THAT I'M TAKING TODAY
FOLLOWS A NINE-MONTH 
INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT 
OF COMMERCE, SECRETARY ROSS, 
DOCUMENTING A GROWING CRISIS IN 
OUR STEEL AND ALUMINUM 
PRODUCTION THAT THREATENS THE 
SECURITY OF OUR NATION, AND ALSO
IS BAD FOR US ECONOMICALLY AND 
WITH JOBS.
THE AMERICAN STEEL ALUMINUM 
INDUSTRY HAS BEEN RAVAGED BY 
AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN TRADE 
PRACTICES.
IT'S REALLY AN ASSAULT ON OUR 
COUNTRY.
IT'S BEEN AN ASSAULT.
THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY.
OTHER COUNTRIES ADDED PRODUCTION
CAPACITY THAT FAR EXCEEDS 
DEMAND, AND FLUTTERED THE WORLD 
MARKET WITH CHEAP METAL THAT IS 
SUBSIDIZED BY FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENTS, CREATING JOBS FOR 
THEIR COUNTRY AND TAKING AWAY 
JOBS FROM OUR COUNTRY.
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR
A LONG TIME, A LOT LONGER THAN 
MY POLITICAL CAREER.
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR
MANY YEARS.
FOR EXAMPLE, IT TAKES CHINA 
ABOUT ONE MONTH TO PRODUCE AS 
MUCH STEEL AS THEY PRODUCE IN 
THE UNITED STATES IN AN ENTIRE 
YEAR.
BECAUSE WE'VE CLOSED DOWN SO 
MUCH CAPACITY.
PLANTS CLOSED ALL OVER THE 
UNITED STATES, AND SOME PLANTS I
SEE MASSIVE PLANTS FROM 4,000 
YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE WORKING IN
A YOU LITTLE CORNER OF THE 
BUILDING.
WE'RE GOING TO GET THOSE 
BUILDINGS OPEN AGAIN AND 
PRODUCING AGAIN.
THAT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT THING
FOR OUR COUNTRY.
AND THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STOP.
ALUMINUM IMPORTS NOW ACCOUNT FOR
MORE THAN 90% OF THE PRIMARY 
AMERICAN DEMAND.
OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, 
NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICAN 
RAW STEEL COMPANIES HAVE GONE 
OUT OF BUSINESS.
MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE STEEL
JOBS HAVE DISAPPEARED.
SIX PRIMARY ALUMINUM SMELTERS, 
WHICH IS A BIG DEAL, HAVE 
PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN SINCE JUST
2012.
THE ACTIONS WE'RE TAKING TODAY 
ARE NOT A MATTER OF CHOICE, THEY
ARE A MATTER OF NECESSITY FOR 
OUR SECURITY.
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY BENEFITS OF 
THIS ORDER.
YESTERDAY IN ANTICIPATION THAT 
WE WOULD BE HERE TODAY, U.S. 
STEEL ANNOUNCED ITS REOPENING A 
MILL IN ILLINOIS, A BIG ONE, AND
RECALLING 500 WORKERS 
IMMEDIATELY.
THAT'S GOING ON ALL OVER 
COUNTRY.
BY THE WAY, IT WENT ON WITH 
SOLAR PANELS, WHICH WE DID THREE
MONTHS AGO, AND WASHING 
MACHINES, WHERE THEY WERE 
DUMPING WASHING MACHINES ALL 
OVER OUR COUNTRY, AND NOW 
THEY'RE EXPANDING PLANS TO MAKE 
WASHING MACHINES.
A SKILLED, TRAINED WORKFORCE IN 
STEEL IS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF 
AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND 
MUST BE PROTECTED.
AFTER THE SIGNING OF THIS 
PROCLAMATION, CENTURY ALUMINUM 
IN KENTUCKY, IT'S A GREAT 
COMPANY, WILL BE INVESTING OVER 
$100 MILLION TO UPGRADED THEIR 
MILITARY GRADE HIGH-QUALITY 
ALUMINUM PRODUCTION WHICH IS 
ALSO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY.
THAT'S 150,000 ADDITIONAL TONS 
OF ALUMINUM.
THINK OF IT.
THIS IS A CLOSED PLANT AND NOW 
THEY'RE DOING 150,000 TONS.
PRODUCTION AND AN ADDITIONAL 300
WORKERS AND ULTIMATELY MANY MORE
HIRED IN THE GREAT STATE OF 
KENTUCKY.
A PACKAGE OF SOMETIMES $90,000 
PER WORKER.
OUR GREATEST PRESIDENTS ALL 
UNDERSTOOD FROM WASHINGTON TO 
LINCOLN TO JACKSON TO TEDDY 
ROOSEVELT, THAT AMERICA MUST 
HAVE A STRONG, VIBRANT, AND 
INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURING BASE.
HAS TO HAVE IT.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY, WHO FELT 
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS, 
COUNTRY WAS VERY, VERY 
SUCCESSFUL.
WE ACTUALLY OPERATED OUT OF CASH
FLOW, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.
THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF OF THE 
REPUBLICANS HE SAID MADE THE 
LIVES OF MASSES OF OUR 
COUNTRYMEN SWEETER AND BRIGHTER 
AND BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER.
IT IS THE BEST FOR OUR 
CITIZENSHIP AND OUR CIVILIZATION
AND OPENS UP THE HIGHER AND 
BETTER DESTINY FOR OUR PEOPLE.
MANY POLITICIANS LAMENTED THE 
DECLINE OF OUR PROUD INDUSTRIES 
AND DENOUNCED GLOBAL CAPACITY.
BUT NO ONE TOOK ACTION.
ALL OF OUR POLITICIANS SAW WHAT 
WAS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY.
I'VE SEEN IT FOR 25 YEARS I'VE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT.
I TALKED ABOUT JAPAN, TALKED 
ABOUT CHINA.
BUT THE POLITICIANS NEVER DID 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
BUT NOW THEY ARE.
OUR FACTORIES WERE LEFT TO ROT 
AND TO RUST ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THRIVING COMMUNITIES TURNED INTO
GHOST TOWNS.
YOU GUYS KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
NOT ANY LONGER.
THE WORKERS WHO POURED THEIR 
SOULS INTO BUILDING THIS GREAT 
NATION WERE BETRAYED, BUT THAT 
BETRAYAL IS OVER.
I'M DELIVERING ON A PROMISE I 
MADE DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND 
I'VE BEEN MAKING IT FOR A GOOD 
PART OF MY LIFE.
IF I EVER DID THIS WORKS I NEVER
THOUGHT I WOULD, I SAID LET'S 
RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND LOOK WHAT 
HAPPENED.
AND PART OF THE REASON IT HAND 
IS YOU, AND MY MESSAGE HAVING TO
DO WITH YOU, AND OTHER MESSAGES 
ALSO, SECURITY, MILITARY, THE 
WALL, THE BORDER, A LOT OF GOOD 
MESSAGES.
BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT.
MY MOST IMPORTANT JOB IS TO KEEP
AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE.
AND PEOPLE AS YOU KNOW, WE JUST 
HAD APPROVED A $700 BILLION 
MILITARY BUDGET, THE LARGEST 
EVER, $716 BILLION NEXT YEAR.
THAT MEANS NOT ONLY SAFETY, BUT 
IT MEANS JOBS.
IT ALSO MEANS THE USE OF STEEL 
FROM OUR COUNTRY.
BUT IF THE SAME GOALS CAN BE 
ACCOMPLISHED BY OTHER MEANS, 
AMERICA WILL REMAIN OPEN TO 
MODIFYING OR REMOVING THE 
TARIFFS FOR INDIVIDUAL NATIONS 
AS LONG AS WE CAN AGREE ON A WAY
TO ENSURE THEIR PRODUCTS NO 
LONGER THREATEN OUR SECURITY.
SO I'VE PUT AMBASSADOR WHITE 
HISER IN CHARGE NEGOTIATING WITH
COUNTRIES THAT SEEK AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO THE STEEL AND 
ALUMINUM TARIFFS.
THE FACT IS WE'VE BEEN TREATED 
SO BALDLY OVER THE YEARS BY OTHR
COUNTRIES.
WE'VE BEEN TREATED VERY BADLY BY
OUR POLITICIANS, BY OUR 
PRESIDENTS, PEOPLE THAT 
REPRESENTED US THAT DIDN'T, 
FRANKLY, KNOW WHAT THEY WERE 
DOING.
AND WE LOSE $800 BILLION A YEAR 
ON TRADE.
EVERY YEAR, $800 BILLION.
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG 
TIME, $300 BILLION, 
$400 BILLION, $500 BILLION, GOT 
UP TO $600 BILLION.
AND IT KEEPS GOING, BUT IT'S 
GOING TO START CHANGING, HAS TO 
CHANGE.
WE'RE NEGOTIATING NOW WITH 
CHINA.
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A BIG 
NEGOTIATION.
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYTHING'S 
GOING TO COME OF IT.
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL, 
PRESIDENT XI, I FORGET GREAT 
RESPECT FOR, A LOT OF RESPECT.
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYTHING'S
GOING TO COME OF THAT, BUT WE'RE
GOING TO CUT DOWN THE DEFICITS 
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
WE HAVE A DEFICIT WITH CHINA OF 
AT LEAST $500 BILLION, AND WHEN 
YOU ADDENT -- OUR RELATIONSHIP  
CANADA AND MEXICO, WE'RE 
NEGOTIATING RIGHT NOW NAFTA.
AND WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OFF THE 
TARIFF ON THOSE TWO COUNTRIES TO
SEE IF WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE THE 
DEAL ON NAFTA.
NATIONAL SECURITY IS AN 
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT DEAL.
THIS WILL FIGURE INTO THE DEAL 
AND WE WON'T HAVE THE TARIFFS ON
CANADA OR MEXICO F. WE DON'T 
MAKE THE DEAL ON NAFTA AND IF WE
TEMPE
TERMINATE THE DEAL WITH NAFTA, 
AND WE'LL START ALL OVER AGAIN 
OR WE'LL JUST DO IT A DIFFERENT 
WAY.
BUT WE'LL TERMINATE NAFTA, AND 
THAT'LL BE IT.
BUT I HAVE A FEELING WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE A DEAL WITH NAFTA.
I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR A LONG 
TIME.
WE EITHER MAKE A DEAL OR WE 
TERMINATE.
IF WE DO, THERE WON'T BE ANY 
TARIFFS ON CANADA AND THERE 
WON'T BE ANY TARIFFS ON MEXICO.
ONE OTHER THING.
SOME OF THE COUNTRIES THAT WE'RE
DEALING WITH ARE GREAT PARTNERS,
GREAT MILITARY ALLIES.
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT
THAT VERY STRONGLY.
THE TARIFFS DON'T GO EFFECTIVE 
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 15 DAYS.
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHO'S 
TREATING US FAIRLY, WHO'S NOT 
TREATING US FAIRLY.
PART OF THAT'S GOING TO BE 
MILITARY.
WHO'S PAYING THE BILLS, WHO'S 
NOT PAYING THE BILLS.
WE SUBSIDIZE MANY RICH 
COUNTRIES.
IN SOME CASES THEY DON'T PAY 50 
CENTS ON THE DOLLAR, AND WE HAVE
TO STOP THAT.
AND THAT WILL ENTER INTO THE 
EQUATION AS WELL.
I SAW A TWEET THAT JUST CAME IN 
FROM ELON MUSK WHO'S USING OUR 
WONDERFUL SPACE FACILITIES AND 
DID A GREAT JOB THREE WEEKS AGO.
HE SAID, FOR EXAMPLE, AN 
AMERICAN CAR GOING TO CHINA PAYS
25% IMPORT DUTY.
BUT A CHINESE CAR COMING TO THE 
UNITED STATES ONLY PAYS 2.5%, A 
TEN-FOLD DIFFERENCE.
AN AMERICAN CAR GOING TO CHINA, 
THINK OF THAT, PAYS 25% IMPORT 
DUTY.
SO WE SEND OUR CAR OVER THERE, 
PAY 25%.
THEY SEND THEIR CAR OVER HERE, 
2.5%.
THAT'S FROM ELON, BUT EVERYBODY 
KNOWS IT.
THEY'VE KNOWN IT FOR YEARS AND 
NEVER DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
IT'S GOT TO CHANGE.
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A 
RECIPROCAL TAX PROGRAM AT SOME 
POINT SO THAT IF CHINA'S GOING 
TO CHARGE US 25% OR IF INDIA IS 
GOING TO CHARGE US 75% AND WE 
CHARGE THEM NOTHING, IF THEY'RE 
AT 50 OR 75 OR 25, WE'RE GOING 
TO BE AT THOSE SAME NUMBERS.
IT'S A MIRROR TAX.
SO THEY CHARGE US 50, WE CHARGE 
THEM 50.
RIGHT NOW THEY'LL CHARGE US 50, 
WE CHARGE THEM NOTHING.
DOESN'T WORK.
SO THAT'S CALLED A RECIPROCAL 
TAX, A MIRROR TAX, AND WE'RE 
GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF THAT.
THE FIRST YEAR WE'VE REALLY SET 
THE STAGE.
A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH -- 
STRUCTURALLY WE HAD TO GO 
THROUGH CERTAIN PROCEDURES IN 
ORDER TO GET TO THIS POINT BUT 
NOW WE'RE AT THIS POINT.
AMERICAN COMPANIES HAVE NOT BEEN
TREATED FAIRLY.
AND SOME AMERICAN COMPANIES, 
FRANKLY, HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
IT AND GONE TO OTHER COUNTRIES 
AND DEVELOPED IN MEXICO, MASSIVE
AUTOMOBILE PLANTS, TAKING OUR 
JOBS AWAY AND TAKING OUR 
COMPANIES DOWN TO MEXICO TO MAKE
THE CARS.
AND THEN THEY SEND THEM RIGHT 
ACROSS THE BORDER WITHOUT TAX, 
WITHOUT ANYTHING.
SO WE LOSE THE JOBS, THEY MAKE 
THE CARS, THEY GET ALL THE 
BENEFITS, THEN THEY SELL THE 
CARS BACK INTO THE UNITED 
STATES.
SO WE'RE CHANGING THINGS AND WE 
HAVE A LOT OF GREAT 
RELATIONSHIPS.
I THINK COMPANIES ARE GOING TO 
BE VERY HAPPY IN THE END.
I THINK THAT COUNTRIES ARE GOING
TO BE VERY HAPPY.
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW GREAT 
FLEXIBILITY.
AND, AGAIN, MANY OF THE 
COUNTRIES THAT TREAT US THE 
WORST ON TRADE AND ON MILITARY 
ARE OUR ALLIES, AS THEY LIKE TO 
CALL THEM.
SO WE JUST WANT FAIRNESS.
WE JUST WANT FAIRNESS.
WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
RECIPROCAL, AND I THINK IN THE 
END WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF
GREAT JOBS, WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF 
GREAT COMPANIES ALL COMING BACK 
INTO OUR COUNTRY.
YOU SEE IT THE OTHER DAY 
CHRYSLER ANNOUNCED THEY'RE 
LEAVING MEXICO AND CAMOMING BAC 
TO MEXICO WITH A BIG PLANT.
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN A LONG 
TIME.
BECAUSE I SORT OF GREW UP WITH 
THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE, I KNOW A 
LOT ABOUT THE STEEL INDUSTRY AND
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE ALUMINUM 
INDUSTRY.
WE'LL BRING THEM BACK.
I THOUGHT MAYBE A FEW OF YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO SAY A COUPLE 
WORDS.
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT 25 MILLION 
PEOPLE WATCHING, SO DON'T WORRY 
ABOUT IT.
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING?
COME ON UP.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ANNOUNCING AFTER YEARS OF 
AMERICAN WORKERS BEING BETRAYED 
BY THE DUMPING OF FOREIGN STEEL 
HERE CALLING AN ECONOMIC AND 
NATIONAL SECURITY DISASTER, HE 
IS NOW IMPOSING 25% TARIFF ON 
IMPORTED STEEL, 10% TARIFF ON 
IMPORTED ALUMINUM.
I WANT TO GO TO JOHN CARL.
ONE OF THE POINTS THE PRESIDENT 
MADE IS HE'S KEEPING A CAMPAIGN 
PROMISE, THAT IS TRUE.
HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR
A LONG TIME.
BUT THE PROCESS OF GETTING THERE
INSIDE THIS WHITE HOUSE SOMEWHAT
CHAOTIC. 
>> HE'S BEEN ENTIRELY CONSISTENT
ON THE ISSUE OF TRADE AND 
TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO FIGHT 
WHAT HE CALLS UNFAIR TRADE.
BUT THE PROCESS INSIDE THE WHITE
HOUSE, GEORGE, HAS BEEN ANYTHING
BUT CONSISTENT.
THEY'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE MAP.
WE WERE GIVEN SOME GUIDANCE 
EARLIER SUGGESTING THIS WAS NOT 
HAPPENING TODAY, AND SUDDENLY IT
WAS ON THE SCHEDULE, IT IS 
HAPPENING.
WE WERE TOLD IT WAS GOING TO BE 
ACROSS THE BOARD ON EVERY 
COUNTRY.
NOW YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT 
TALKING ABOUT EXEMPTIONS, AT 
LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM FOR 
CANADA AND MEXICO.
BUT THIS WAS A HIGHLY 
CONTROVERSIAL DECISION WITHIN 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND WITHIN THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
>> THE PRESIDENT GETTING A LOT 
OF PUSHBACK FROM THE SPEAKER OF 
THE HOUSE, PAUL RYAN, AND A 
MAJORITY OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS. 
>> IN FACT, JUST A FEW MINUTES 
AGO RYAN ACTUALLY SAID THAT HE 
IS STILL TRYING TO GET THE 
PRESIDENT TO CHANGE HIS MIND ON 
THIS. 
>> MEANTIME, REBECCA JARVIS IS 
HERE.
THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE POINT 
THAT HE THINKS THIS IS GOING TO 
BRING BACK JOBS, MOST ECONOMISTS
SAY IT WILL COST MORE JOBS 
BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON THOSE 
WHO CONSUME STEEL AND ALUMINUM. 
>> ALMOST ALL ECONOMISTS BELIEVE
THIS, GEORGE.
33,000 STEEL AND ALUMINUM JOBS 
GAINED HERE, BUT 179,000 
MANUFACTURING JOBS POTENTIALLY 
LOST TO THESE TARIFFS.
AND THE REASON IS THAT BY 
INCREASING THESE TARIFFS, THAT 
INCREASES THE COST OF DOING 
BUSINESS FOR ANY COMPANY THAT 
DEALS IN STEEL AND ALUMINUM.
IMAGINE CAR COMPANIES, HOME 
BUILDERS THAT USE PRODUCTS TO 
BUILD HOMES.
THOSE PRODUCTS GET MORE 
EXPENSIVE FOR THE COMPANIES TO 
CREATE AND CAN ULTIMATELY DRIVE 
UP COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. 
>> WHEN THIS FIRST CAME OUT LAST
WEEK, THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TOOK
A DEEP DIVE ON FRIDAY. 
>> THEY HAVE STABILIZED, AND ONE
OF THE FEARS IS THE RETALIATION.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN AS IT GOES 
AROUND THE WORLD?
WE'VE HEARD FROM CHINA, THE 
EUROPEAN UNION, THAT THEY WOULD 
RETALIATE IF WE HIKED THOSE 
TARIFFS ON THEIR PRODUCTS.
IN PARTICULAR, HOW SPEAKER RYAN 
WILL IN HIS HOME STATE, HARLEY 
DAVIDSON, ONE OF THE TARGETS OF 
THE EU, BOURBON, BLUE JEANS AND 
MOTORCYCLES. 
>> SECRETARY TRADE REP NOT 
THERE.
GARY COHN HAS ANNOUNCED HE'S 
LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> HE WAS OPPOSED TO THESE 
TARIFFS, FOUGHT THEM THROUGHOUT 
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE 
PRESIDENCY.
AND HE WARNED THE PRESIDENT IT 
WAS NOT JUST BAD POLICY, BUT 
THIS WOULD HAVE BAD 
REPERCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE 
AMERICAN ECONOMY RESULTING IN 
THE PRICES INCREASES YOU HEARD 
REBECCA TALKING ABOUT, RESULTING
IN RETALIATION FROM OUR 
NEIGHBORS.
AND HE QUIT OVER THIS ISSUE.
HE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE WHITE 
HOUSE OVER THIS ISSUE, PERHAPS 
THE MOST WILDLY RESPECTED MEMBER
OF THE WEST WING STAFF. 
>> LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE 
WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS.
YOU CAN GET THE LATEST NEWS ON 
THAT ALL DAY LONG ON ABC 
NEWS.COM.
THERE WILL BE A FULL WRAP UP 
TONIGHT WITH DAVID MUIR.
HAVE A GOOD
