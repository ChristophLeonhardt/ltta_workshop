00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,490
of you ask we answer the first question

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,949
today comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> tim hobbes who asks</font>

4
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,230
will android<font color="#CCCCCC"> google's mobile operating</font>

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,550
system dethrone the iphone and when well

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,500
that depends on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of stat you're</font>

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,820
looking at you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at strict</font>

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,920
market share are you looking at share of

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,030
the US market worldwide and apps at just

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,030
kind of subjective mind chair and the

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,590
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each of those questions is</font>

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,660
different right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now obviously apple's</font>

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,370
market share is much bigger than

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,840
google's and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
available in more countries worldwide

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,000
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of has a bit i would say a more</font>

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,090
known brand and also is available on

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,039
more carriers those things will change

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,050
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> android is going to be</font>

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,090
built into phones for more manufacturers

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,440
it's going to be available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in more</font>

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,559
countries and on more carriers pricing

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,869
is also a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal so far there's no</font>

24
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,729
android phone that really competes with

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,540
the $99 iphone 3g unless you're looking

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,400
at kind of older device that's going to

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,299
change as well as slower messaging

28
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,220
phones that are not quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> smartphones</font>

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,530
become cheaper to produce those will

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,509
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android phones and soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font>

31
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,000
will be available<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a free option or</font>

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,860
something that may cost twenty nine

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,680
dollars or something like that so if

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,689
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at strictly the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high-end</font>

35
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,329
stuff like the nexus one that and the

36
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,000
iphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> will probably it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,829
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> while before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google catches up</font>

38
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,659
but what could easily happen is if

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google Android becomes something that</font>

40
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:48,360
motorola and samsung and LG build into

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,270
they're really cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of lower end</font>

42
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,530
messaging or feature phones as the

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,540
industry calls them that's one place

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,159
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android could really kind of jump</font>

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,320
ahead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple because smartphones are</font>

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">still you know while they are growing</font>

47
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,969
market growing maybe 35 to 50 percent

48
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,320
year-over-year depending on where you're

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,950
looking the mobile market is still huge

50
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,780
smartphones are a relatively small chunk

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,760
of them and these messaging phones so a

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,010
lot of units if you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

53
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,840
something else like developer mindshare

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,180
or apps that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

55
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,610
going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer before people catch</font>

56
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,520
up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple I was at a mobile event last</font>

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,620
night where someone said a developer

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,510
said the iphone app store is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,190
only way to make money selling apps

60
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google has an app store of course it has</font>

61
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,330
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of applications but the</font>

62
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">commerce options just are not as good as</font>

63
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,650
apples and until Google makes changes

64
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,540
there the iphone app store is still

65
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be the app store of choice for</font>

66
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,879
developers both because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the commerce</font>

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,650
options and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the install base</font>

68
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,690
with the iphone and the ipod<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch being</font>

69
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,330
so large so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can google do to get</font>

70
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,489
better a it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do better with the</font>

commerce options that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> google</font>

72
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,720
absolutely must make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it easier for</font>

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to buy apps to buy virtual goods</font>

74
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,909
within apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> google must make the</font>

00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">application process easier for</font>

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
developers they have an advantage that

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,220
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need apps to be approved</font>

78
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">before they get into the store but they</font>

79
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,489
have the disadvantage that the tools

80
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,560
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't as good as apples are and</font>

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,629
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to do better with</font>

82
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,629
marketing right now you cannot search on

83
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,190
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> desktop through the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> android app</font>

84
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,629
store you could only do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the phone</font>

85
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:23,849
it's harder to take screenshots of apps

86
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,250
unless you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sdk installed on</font>

87
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,989
your computer there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of stuff</font>

88
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,459
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just has a more polished</font>

89
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,680
complete experience and that's where

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android needs to improve so the next</font>

91
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,299
question comes from app world first

92
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,220
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is stats are most downloaded</font>

93
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,180
free and paid iphone apps not quite sure

94
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,890
what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means Apple of course</font>

95
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,730
keeps an up-to-date listing of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

96
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,459
popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> free apps the most popular paid</font>

97
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,110
apps and also the top grossing apps

98
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,090
where they measure units sold by the

99
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">average price if you're curious about</font>

100
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many apps per day are sold in the</font>

101
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,599
top few slots my last understanding was

102
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US it's for the free apps i think</font>

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,760
it's around maybe 50,000 to a hundred

104
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,650
thousand a day and for paid it could be

105
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,580
around 10,000 a day but don't quote me

106
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,400
on that

107
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,380
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple will never</font>

108
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,639
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of this stuff and</font>

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,040
developers choose to report this stuff

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,039
on a self-selecting basis so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

111
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,870
sure it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day Christmas Day</font>

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,060
obviously is a huge day for epson some

113

days are probably much slower but it is

114
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,870
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think within a week if you're</font>

116
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,350
you're in a lot of countries you could

probably get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million users that way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

iphone users can you confirm that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

what is the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question also</font>

124
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,810
from app world that would make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

me<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I that's just data that</font>

126
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,740
Verizon and AT&T probably aren't going

127
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,350
to share with anyone but it makes sense

128
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the</font>

pictures some video the iphone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

133
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,620
droid also have Wi-Fi connection so a

134

lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uploading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,030
their data usage to Wi-Fi which does not

136
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,090
affect the cellular network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

137
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">really know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the real data usage is</font>

138
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,620
but i can tell you my personal data

139
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,169
usage in the last year and a half or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

140
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,320
on the iphone with a lot of Wi-Fi usage

141
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,419
so this is affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that i've</font>

142
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,150
downloaded 3.3 gigabytes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

143
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,699
uploaded 383 megabytes so that's really

144
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that much data you know that's not</font>

145
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">even one dvds worth of download and it's</font>

146
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,460
not even you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's not even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four zip</font>

147
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,970
disks worth of uploading so<font color="#CCCCCC"> AT&T you've</font>

148
00:05:54,970 --> 00:00:00,000
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty nice margin off of me</font>
