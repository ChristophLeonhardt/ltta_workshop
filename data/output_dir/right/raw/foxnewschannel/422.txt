00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,297
>> Shannon: ED HENRY,

2
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:05,134
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,201
WITH THE SEVENTH BACKGROUND

4
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,136
CHECK ON BRETT KAVANAUGH

5
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:07,936
POTENTIALLY DONE AS SOON AS

6
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,172
TOMORROW, I VOTE COMING SOON

7
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,240
AFTER, SENATOR KOERBER SAYS HE

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,241
DOES BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS MAY

9
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,809
HAVE OVERPLAYED THEIR HANDS.

10
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,045
LET'S BEGIN HER OWN POLITICAL

11
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,479
ASK

12
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:20,983
EXPERT, THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN

13
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:21,750
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, GOOD TO SEE

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,353
BOTH TONIGHT.

15
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:25,287
KAYLEE, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

16
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:26,856
VERY DISCIPLINED ABOUT THIS.

17
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,891
TONIGHT THAT SEEMED VERY

18
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:29,592
UNSCRIPTED AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH

19
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:31,660
AND THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE

20
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,561
PROCEEDING.

21
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:33,963
WITH THAT OFF MESSAGE FOR THEM

22
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:38,767
TONIGHT OR THAT EXACTLY WHAT HE

23
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:39,735
WANTED TO SAY.

24
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,170
>> I THINK IT IS EXACTLY WHAT

25
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,837
YOU WANTED TO SAY.

26
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:45,040
HER TESTIMONY, SHE COULD NOT

27
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,242
RECALL THE TIME, THE PLACE TO

28
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:48,210
HIM HOW SHE GOT TO THE HOUSE,

29
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,746
BUT SHE DID HAPPEN TO REMEMBER

30
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:51,780
TWO THINGS, THAT SHE HAD ONE

31
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,550
BEER AND THAT SHE WAS 100%

32
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,451
CERTAIN THAT THIS PERSON WAS

33
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:56,819
BRETT KAVANAUGH AFTER 30 YEARS

34
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,988
OF NOT BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY

35
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:00,056
HIM OR NOT TELLING ANYONE THAT

36
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:01,991
IT WAS IN FACT HIM WHO WAS THE

37
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:02,391
ASSAILANTS.

38
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:04,260
I THINK IS MAKING THAT POINT

39
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,061
WHICH SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE MADE.

40
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:06,562
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK NOW

41
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:08,130
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE LET

42
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,898
PEOPLE WEIGHING IN FROM ALL OVER

43
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:11,834
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM ON THIS.

44
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,436
EVEN REPUBLICANS NOW ARE SEEMING

45
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:17,573
TO WANT TO HEDGE THEIR BETS.

46
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:18,674
THAT INCLUDES SENATOR JEFF FLAKE

47
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:20,576
WHO LED US TO THIS ONE WEEK

48
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:21,911
DELAY AND THE FBI, HERE'S WHAT

49
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:24,146
HE SAID.

50
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:26,215
>> I TELL MYSELF, YOU GIVE A

51
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:26,982
LITTLE LEEWAY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE

52
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:30,352
HAS BEEN THROUGH.

53
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:32,755
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE CAN'T HAVE

54
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,957
THIS ON THE COURT.

55
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:36,292
WE SIMPLY CANNOT.

56
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,026
>> Shannon: THAT IS VERY MUCH

57
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:37,993
SOMETHING WE HAVE SAID FROM YOUR

58
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:39,729
FORMER BOSS, HERE'S

59
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,964
HILLARY CLINTON.

60
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:44,366
>> FOR ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THERE

61
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:46,068
IS SUCH THING AS A JUDICIAL

62
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,537
TEMPERAMENT AND THAT WE WANT

63
00:01:48,537 --> 00:01:51,674
JUDGES PARTICULARLY THOSE ON OUR

64
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:53,209
HIGHEST COURT TO APPROACH

65
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:55,211
ISSUES, APPROACH PLAINTIFFS AND

66
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:57,346
DEFENDANTS WITH A SENSE OF

67
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:57,947
FAIRNESS.

68
00:01:57,947 --> 00:01:59,749
THAT THERE IS A LOT TO BE

69
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:00,216
CONCERNED ABOUT.

70
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:00,983
>> Shannon: OVER THE WEEKEND,

71
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:03,686
THIS IS A NEW THING,

72
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:04,954
TEMPERAMENTS.

73
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:05,821
HE IS BACKED INTO A CORNER

74
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,858
TRYING TO FIGHT HIS WAY OUT, HE

75
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:09,892
SEEMED WAY TOO EMOTIONAL.

76
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:11,160
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT WAS

77
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,295
EMOTIONAL, THINK THAT WAS A

78
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:14,163
MELTDOWN.

79
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:15,164
I UNDERSTAND IF SOMEONE COME

80
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:16,165
I'VE BEEN ASKED THIS, WHAT WOULD

81
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:16,766
YOU DO?

82
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,534
WOULD YOU JUST SAT THERE, NO, I

83
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:20,102
WOULD BE INDIGNANT, WOULD BE

84
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:20,503
UPSET.

85
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:23,305
YOU KNOW I WOULD DO QUESTION

86
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:24,540
WORK ON CALL FOR AN

87
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,974
INVESTIGATION.

88
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:26,242
IF I'M INNOCENT THAT I WILL

89
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:27,643
RESPECT WHAT SHE SAID AND I

90
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:28,377
CANNOT RECONCILE THE TWO BUT I

91
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,678
WANT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT

92
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:30,746
AND I WANT YOU TO ADD TO THE

93
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:31,847
BOTTOM OF THIS AND I'M NOT GOING

94
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,649
ANYWHERE UNTIL YOU DO.

95
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:38,554
THAT IS NOT WHAT HE SAID.

96
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:39,922
HE SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID I WANT

97
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:41,157
AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE

98
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:42,758
NEXT DAY EVERYONE TURNED ON HIM

99
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:44,160
AND CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION.

100
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,962
IT WAS SILLY.

101
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:47,563
I THINK HE TEMPERAMENT PART IS

102
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:48,564
LEGITIMATE.

103
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:49,765
WE WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS A

104
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:50,967
MATURITY.

105
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:51,934
WHICH OF THE SAND?

106
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:53,569
SLOVER LIKE A JUDGE.

107
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,004
THAT MAN WAS NOT JUST OVER LIKE

108
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:55,972
A JUDGE.

109
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:58,307
HE PRACTICALLY HAD ANGER

110
00:02:58,307 --> 00:02:59,041
MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS.

111
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,209
I UNDERSTAND HOW FRUSTRATING

112
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,544
THIS IS BUT THERE IS A WAY TO BE

113
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:04,080
STRONG AND DENY IT AND EXPLAIN

114
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,950
AND BE COMPELLING, WITHOUT THE

115
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,618
GUY WHO SHOWED UP.

116
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:10,186
IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE BOYS

117
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:13,923
WILL BE BOYS DEFENSE, DON'T BE

118
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,291
THE JUDGE.

119
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,727
>> THAT WAS NOT A MELTDOWN,

120
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:18,962
DEMOCRATS CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH

121
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:19,262
WAYS.

122
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,496
HAD HE NOT SHOWED ANY EMOTION

123
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:21,965
THEY WOULD'VE SAID HE WAS COLD,

124
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:24,367
HE DIDN'T SHOW ANY EMOTION, HE

125
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,802
WAS VERY CALM I THOUGHT.

126
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:26,970
I THOUGHT HE SHOWED EMOTION

127
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,403
APPROPRIATELY.

128
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:29,505
IF YOU WOULD USE IT THERE FOR A

129
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:30,373
WEEK AS HE WATCHED THE

130
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:32,241
MAINSTREAM MEDIA'S SMEAR YOUR

131
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:34,544
NAME WITH HEINOUS ALLEGATIONS OF

132
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:35,712
GANG-RAPE, PRETTY SURE THAT

133
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:37,747
ANYONE WOULD REACT OR THAT HE

134
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:38,147
REACTED.

135
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:39,182
>> Shannon: AND THE FAMILY AS

136
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,284
WELL, WHAT IS HAPPENING ON BOTH

137
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:41,584
SIDES.

138
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:45,989
DR. FORD'S FAMILY, THIS IS AN

139
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,191
INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL SITUATION.

140
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,592
>> I KNOW PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE

141
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:51,060
BRETT KAVANAUGH FAMILY AND THEY

142
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,728
SWEAR BY THEM, THEY CAN'T

143
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,463
BELIEVE THIS.

144
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:55,999
THIS WOMAN CAME FORWARD AND SHE

145
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,867
MADE A STATEMENT AND I DON'T

146
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:58,701
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REPUBLICAN

147
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:02,672
TALKING POINTS ARE.

148
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:05,675
>> THE TALKING POINT IS THAT

149
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:06,810
THERE IS NO CORROBORATE

150
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,877
EVIDENCE.

151
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,846
>> ISSUE LYING?

152
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:13,483
>> I THINK PEOPLE THINK

153
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:14,184
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

154
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:15,051
SENATOR THAT I REMAIN VERY

155
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,120
CONCERNED WE MIGHT NOT GET THE

156
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,353
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAT THE

157
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:19,755
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS WEREN'T ON

158
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:20,423
THE SENATE AND THE AMERICAN

159
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:21,958
PEOPLE DESERVE.

160
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:22,792
HE WAS PART OF THE ONE MAKING

161
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,795
THE DEAL.

162
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:27,130
NOW KAYLEE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU

163
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,598
WILL NOT BE GOOD ENOUGH.

164
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,734
>> TO QUOTE SENATOR McCONNELL,

165
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:32,335
I CAN ALMOST HEAR HIM MOVING THE

166
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:32,702
GOAL POST.

167
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:34,304
THIS WAS A PREDICABLE AND POINT

168
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:36,273
OF DEMOCRATS.

169
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:36,973
THEY WOULD OFFER THE

170
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:37,641
INVESTIGATION, AMY KLOBUCHAR

171
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:39,943
SUCH AS WHEN WE COME WHICH IS A

172
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:40,810
PROBLEM WITH ONE WEEK?

173
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,878
NO NOTHING IS GOOD NOT BECAUSE

174
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:44,281
NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY

175
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:45,215
DEMOCRATS.

176
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:48,351
IT IS ABOUT TO LAY UNTIL THE

177
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:48,752
MID-TERMS.

178
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:50,554
THAT IS A SAD TRUTH AND IN DOING

179
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:52,155
SO THEY ARE SMEARING AN INNOCENT

180
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:52,556
MAN.

181
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:53,156
>> Shannon: OF THE

182
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:54,558
INVESTIGATION IS DONE BY

183
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:55,258
TOMORROW OR WILL THEY VOTE BY

184
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:55,825
THE END OF THE WEEK?

185
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:59,396
>> I THINK I SHOULD BE DEADLINE.

186
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:02,532
>> Shannon: IF THE BOAT IS N,

187
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:03,567
SHOULD THEY VOTE?

188
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:04,968
>> SURE.

189
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:06,069
>> ON FRIDAY JUDGE KAVANAUGH

190
00:05:06,069 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL BECOME JUST AS KAVANAUGH.
