1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,803
TACTICAL GROUND MISSILES, AND IT

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:03,871
WAS A BIG OPERATION.

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,240
WHERE DOES THIS GO FROM HERE?

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,675
IN THIS PROXY WAR, IF YOU WILL?

5
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,910
WE WILL BRING IN THE PANEL,

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,212
STEVE HILTON, FORMER ADVISER,

7
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,417
AND HOST OF "NEXT REVOLUTION"

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,018
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:18,819
GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF

10
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:19,186
POLITICS.

11
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,690
AND BYRON YORK, POLITICIAN OF

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,123
THE EXAMINER.

13
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,192
IT DID NOT GET A TON OF

14
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,594
COVERAGE, BUT I THINK THAT THE

15
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,797
PROSPECT OF THIS BECOMING A

16
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,398
MAJOR THING IN THE MIDDLE EAST

17
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:31,832
COULD BE BIG.

18
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,801
>> AND THE QUESTION IS THAT WHAT

19
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,836
DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT HAS

20
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,405
JUST HAPPENED AND WITH THE IRAN

21
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,808
DEAL, AND CLEARLY IRAN AND

22
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,009
ISRAEL HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING A

23
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,111
SHADOW WAR IN THE AREA FOR QUITE

24
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:44,478
SOME TIME.

25
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,813
AND IT HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE

26
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:46,614
AND WORSE AND WORSE.

27
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,850
WHAT WE ARE STRIKING IS THE

28
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,784
REACTION OF THE TRUMP

29
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,386
ADMINISTRATION, A VERY, VERY

30
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,790
STRONG MESSAGE IN SUPPORT OF

31
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,959
ISRAEL, NOT ONLY AFFIRMING

32
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,094
ISRAEL'S SUPPORTING GOING

33
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,595
FIGHTING BACK, BUT IT'S RIGHT TO

34
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,997
FIGHT BACK AND DEFEND ITSELF.

35
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:06,033
SO I THINK THAT WE SAW, ALSO

36
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:06,800
JUST A SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS

37
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,203
SOUND BITES THAT WE HEARD, WE

38
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,337
HAVE HEARD A VERY DIFFERENT

39
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,739
MESSAGE I DID THIS WHITE HOUSE

40
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,806
AND THE PREVIOUS ONE.

41
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:19,446
>> Bret: AND THE WAKE OF THE DEA

42
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:19,980
>> Bret: AND THE WAKE OF THE DEL

43
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,382
IS THE PROSPECT THAT IS

44
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:21,982
GREATER.

45
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,784
>> YES, THAT'S WHERE THE

46
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:24,852
EUROPEAN ALLIES WERE WORRIED

47
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,121
ABOUT, I AGREE, THERE IS BEEN

48
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,789
THERE SHADOW WAR THAT IS BEING

49
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,357
FOUGHT, AND TWO THERE WAS A LOT

50
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,992
OF CONCERN FROM EUROPEAN ALLIES

51
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,595
THAT BY WALKING AWAY FROM THE

52
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,295
DEAL, IT MIGHT STOKE TENSIONS

53
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,965
JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT SHADOW

54
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,266
WAR BUBBLE UP INTO THE SURFACE

55
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,635
AND MAKE IT MORE INTENSE.

56
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,605
I DO NOT THINK ANYONE QUESTIONS

57
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,406
ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF.

58
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,808
I THINK THAT WE ALL STAND WITH

59
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:48,208
ISRAEL.

60
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,211
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD FROM OUR

61
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,114
EUROPEAN ALLIES TODAY, CALLS,

62
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,216
PLEASE, FOR A LEVEL OF MEASURED

63
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,017
RESPONSE.

64
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,919
THAT WE DO NOT ALLOW THIS THING

65
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,654
TO ESCALATE AS IT SO EASILY

66
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,388
COULD.

67
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:02,656
AND TRY TO BRING EVERYONE BACK

68
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,792
TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE TO FIND

69
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:05,192
A NEW DEAL.

70
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,461
>> Bret: ON THE FLIP SIDE, THE

71
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,830
IRAN DEAL, IT WAS NOT SPENDING

72
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,565
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, FILLING

73
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,901
THE POT HOLES, THEY WERE

74
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,235
OBVIOUSLY INVESTING IN MILITARY

75
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,640
OPERATIONS IN SYRIA, AND FUNDING

76
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,908
HAS GONE AWAY WITHOUT MONEY.

77
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,811
>> YOU COULD NOT ASK FOR BETTER

78
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,511
JUSTIFICATION WITH WHAT THE

79
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,879
PRESIDENT DID WITH THE IRAN

80
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,215
DEAL, IT PROVES THE POINT THAT

81
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,184
ACTUALLY IRAN IS AN AGGRESSIVE

82
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,052
WARMONGERING REGIME AND WANTS TO

83
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:32,786
CONTROL THE WHOLE REGION FOR A

84
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,155
LONG TIME NOW.

85
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,825
THE POLICY OF THE U.S. AND THE

86
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,892
EUROPEAN ALLIES HAS BEEN

87
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,961
APPEASEMENT, ESSENTIALLY, IF WE

88
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,329
TALK TO YOU WHEN WE GIVE YOU

89
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,163
MONEY AND WE SUPPORT YOU, THERE

90
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,365
MAY BE YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR

91
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,667
WAYS, THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED.

92
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,435
AND SO NOW WE ARE IN THE NEW

93
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,838
WORLD WHERE THE POLICY IS TO

94
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,672
STAND UP TO THE BULLY AND

95
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,840
CONFRONT THE BULLY, AND THAT IS

96
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,841
NOT COMFORTABLE.

97
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,209
IT IS NOT EASY.

98
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,277
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ALLIES

99
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,912
ARE GETTING NERVOUS, BUT THAT

100
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,049
HER POLICY HAS FAILED TO CONTAIN

101
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:02,382
IRAN.

102
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,184
>> THEY ARE ALSO NOT THE ONLY

103
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,253
ALLIES IN THE WHOLE WORLD TO BE

104
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,387
CONCERNED ABOUT.

105
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,790
THERE ARE THE EGYPTIANS, THE

106
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,991
SAUDIS, AND THERE ARE OTHER

107
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,192
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO HAVE A

108
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,393
BIG STAKE IN THIS.

109
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,795
I THINK THAT THEY SUPPORT WHAT

110
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:15,796
THE UNITED STATES IS DOING.

111
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,765
>> Bret: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

112
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,433
BIG MOMENT OVERNIGHT, WE HAVE

113
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,735
COVERED IT, THE THREE AMERICANS

114
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,936
COMING HOME FROM NORTH KOREA.

115
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,607
AND THE QUESTION WAS, WHO GETS

116
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,207
CREDIT?

117
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,308
AND HOW MUCH NORTH KOREA CREDIT

118
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,277
IS THERE NOW THAT THE SUMMIT IS

119
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,913
SET IN PLACE, HERE IS THE

120
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,882
PRESIDENT AND THE MINORITY

121
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,618
LEADER.

122
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:42,656
>> WE WANT TO THANK KIM JONG UN

123
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:47,194
FOR REALLY, IT WAS EXCELLENT,

124
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,996
TAKING THESE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.

125
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,998
>> THE EXULTATION BY THE

126
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:51,632
PRESIDENT AND OTHERS WITH

127
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,634
NORTH KOREA DOING THIS.

128
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,402
IT EVADES ME.

129
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,972
WE CANNOT BE FOOLED INTO GIVING

130
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,007
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME CREDIT

131
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,775
FOR RETURNING AMERICANS THAT

132
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:02,676
NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DETAINED

133
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:07,014
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

134
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,549
AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE NOT

135
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,883
DIPLOMATIC BARGAINING CHIPS.

136
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,718
>> Bret: WHAT ABOUT THAT,

137
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,052
STEVE?

138
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,923
>> THIS REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF

139
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:16,923
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKES

140
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,858
I THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

141
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,661
CRITICS MAKE OVER AND OVER AND

142
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:21,795
OVER AGAIN.

143
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,564
THEY FOCUS ALMOST ENTIRELY ON

144
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,232
HIS WORDS, HIS PERFORMANCE,

145
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,501
ALMOST LIKE TV CRITICS RATHER

146
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,169
THAN POLITICAL ANALYSTS.

147
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,437
THEY IGNORE THE SUBSTANCE.

148
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,872
SOMETIMES HE SAYS WORDS THAT

149
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,875
WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED

150
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,310
DIPLOMATIC IN THE NORMAL

151
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,010
PARLANCE OF POLITICS, BUT HE

152
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,011
GETS THE RESULTS.

153
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,780
AND THEY FOCUS ON THE

154
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,180
SUPERFICIAL.

155
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,715
AND EIGHT IGNORE THE FACT THAT

156
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,984
HE IS ACTUALLY MAKING REAL

157
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,018
PROGRESS.

158
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,454
>> IT IS WAY TOO EARLY TO KNOW

159
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,758
WHETHER HE IS MAKING PROGRESS ON

160
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,192
NORTH KOREA.

161
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,194
THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR SEIZED

162
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,296
AMERICAN CITIZENS, TWO OF WHICH

163
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,531
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, THIS

164
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,198
PRESIDENT.

165
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,534
AND RETURN THEM TODAY, JUST AS

166
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,803
WE ARE ABOUT TO HEAD INTO A

167
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,637
SUMMIT.

168
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,439
I AM HOPEFUL, AND THE DEMOCRATS,

169
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,875
BUT I AM HOPEFUL THAT OUR

170
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,909
PRESIDENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN THE

171
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:09,877
SUMMIT.

172
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:10,611
BUT THERE ARE MANY FLAGS HERE.

173
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,079
THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE

174
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,380
NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

175
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,783
AND THAT THIS NORTH KOREAN

176
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,419
DICTATOR IS LOOKING TO BE SEEN

177
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,420
AS AN EQUAL OF THE

178
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,588
UNITED STATES, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

179
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,391
THE COMMENTS THAT HE HAS BEEN

180
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,593
MAKING, IT ISN'T ABOUT, HE IS

181
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,161
PROMISING TO STOP NUCLEAR

182
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:28,962
TESTING, WHY?

183
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,164
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT THE

184
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,599
NUCLEAR TESTS ARE ALREADY

185
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,100
SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH.

186
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,736
HE SAYS THE TOTAL

187
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,637
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

188
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:37,771
PENINSULA, THAT MEANS THE

189
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,605
UNITED STATES TOO.

190
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,806
I HOPE THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN

191
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,807
GO.

192
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,342
AND IF HE CAN NEGOTIATE

193
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,777
SOMETHING SUCCESSFUL, I WILL BE

194
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,445
AMONG THE FIRST TO APPLAUD HIM.

195
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,413
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF RED

196
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:46,713
FLAGS.

197
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,017
AND I WORRY, I WORRIED THAT THE

198
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:50,817
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR'S ARE

199
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,619
PLAYING A LITTLE BIT.

200
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,421
>> Bret: WE OBVIOUSLY DO NOT

201
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,555
KNOW THE DETAILS, AND THE DEVIL

202
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,990
WILL BE ON THE DETAILS, BUT A

203
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,594
MONTH AGO, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE

204
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:01,662
SAYING THAT WE ARE HEADING TO

205
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,229
WAR WITH NORTH KOREA.

206
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,597
TO SPEAK OF THE JUNE 12TH IN

207
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,432
SINGAPORE MEANS THAT IT IS MORE

208
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,500
LIKELY TO HAPPEN, A LOT OF TALK

209
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,801
ABOUT HOW IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN,

210
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,236
BUT CAN WE JUST SAY THAT THE REL

211
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:09,269
BUT CAN WE JUST SAY THAT THE REA

212
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:09,303
BUT CAN WE JUST SAY THAT THE REE

213
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:09,336
BUT CAN WE JUST SAY THAT THE REO

214
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,103
BUT CAN WE JUST SAY THAT THE REF

215
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,171
THE THREE AMERICANS IS GREAT

216
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,339
NEWS.

217
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,174
IT IS GOOD NEWS FOR THEM AND

218
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,375
GOOD NEWS FOR THE UNITED STATES.

219
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,678
AND IT IS GOOD NEWS FOR

220
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,412
DONALD TRUMP.

221
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,347
SO EVEN, AND IT IS NOT

222
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,348
CONDITIONAL ON THE SUCCESS OF

223
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,482
THE NORTH KOREAN TALKS IF THEY

224
00:06:22,482 --> 00:00:00,000
DO NOT SUCCEED, JUST LIKE THEY
