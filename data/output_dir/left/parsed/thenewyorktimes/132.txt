My name is Debra Granik
and I’m the co-writer
and director of the
film "Leave No Trace."
In this scene, Thomasin
McKenzie and Ben Foster,
who are playing the
lead characters,
are in their encampment.
And they’ve lived there
trying to be undetected.
And they hear something
which cues them that it’s
little different than normal.
They’ve heard many
sounds over the years.
This is different.
“It’s not a drill."
They run and perform a
hiding procedure that they’ve
practiced before.
And we were very surprised
that in the Pacific
Northwest, I wondered 
what some techniques were
for camouflaging.
Turns out sword ferns,
these primordial plants that
have been with us since,
I guess, dinosaur times,
you can roll into them.
And Thom and Ben
practiced how to roll
into one of these ferns.
And it’s also known
to soldiers who had
been in jungle situations.
And you really can
become undetected.
And there’s a very
intense system
about the glint of the eye and
reflective surfaces, anything
of a lighter color.
So you really can’t
show your eye.
So spying out becomes
very difficult.
And we had the benefit of
working with real police
officers from the Portland
PD who told us how
they would approach the search.
And their K-9 dog was
being heavily controlled,
and of course we
took measures so
that the dog understood it
was doing an exercise, not
a real recon.
But the fact that the dog
was there and it was barking
and there was tension, I think
it made the scene very vivid
for the actors.
This scene is shot in a county
park outside of Portland.
We had the great fortune
of having a ranger that
ran that park allow us
to work with him to film
in a relatively
benign way, you know,
and repatriate any
fern that we trampled.
And everything
you see there is
what the temperate rain forest
of the Pacific Northwest
offers.
“Anything on you that’s
going to hurt me?"
“Just the knives."
I think something that became
very heavy as we were filming
this was there wasn’t a
person standing there —
and we were a
50-person crew all in —
who could witness
the scene and not
have it curse through
their brain, what
if Will was black?
That this scene would
play out possibly so
devastatingly differently.
And it was such a hallmark of
our time to watch the scene
and not have —
it’s not a phantom
memory, it’s
a very contemporary anxiety
about how things are playing
out with the lives of men
of color and treatment
by police.
So it is not in the text.
But it was in people’s
minds as it was filmed.
And no, that’s not enough.
The next step is have
it be in the text.
“Dad!"
“Dad?"
