typical guy everyday if your hair is dry every two to three days and you can rinse it in-between to refresh it but you just don't want to constantly remove all the natural oils on the hair especially if you do have that hair that tends to be a little bit coarse or very dry it could depend on the style that you're going for it can also depend on the texture of your hair if you are let's say Hispanic African American your hair can tend to be a little bit drier you wouldn't want to wash your hair as often if your hair is sort of wimpy like mine you might want to wash it a little bit more often I think you know to do it on a daily basis is not a bad thing if you're going to spend time shampooing your hair massage your scalp you know and I don't mean like a massage that way but more of a kneading action on the scalp because that will at least stimulate circulation in the scalp which is good for hair growth
