Venezuela's celebrating the re-election of Nicolas Maduro to a second term as oppressive socialist dictator despite Maduro 75 percent disapproval rating he won 68 percent of the vote overcoming his popularity deficit by winning the votes of people who don't exist and people who were afraid of being killed if they didn't vote for Maduro Venezuelans celebrated the start of six more years of socialism by gathering together to dine on delightful native dishes like cat roasted over a trash fire and trash roasted over a burning cat which had become very popular under the Marxist regime as one voter put it before we had socialism our values were corrupted by material goods like food and medicine but now living by the principles of Karl Marx we can concentrate on the things that matter like dying in the street and getting choked with teargas during food riots here in America Bernie Sanders cheered Venezuela's commitment to the same socialist ideals he espouses saying it's ridiculous to blame Marxism for the country's troubles when those troubles are clearly due to invisible demon space aliens traveling through the phone lines to infect the water-supply no that makes as much sense of socialism trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show all right I am Andrew Clavin those of you who are with us live are probably thinking and reclaim it where's bench up arrow I get that a lot I get I eat my wife says that when I come home of those hi honey I'm all wet after Clavin where's Ben Shapiro but man it is hot celebrating a Jewish holiday at least that's what he that's what he told I think Ben makes these up now he takes off so many so many holidays I think he comes in he says yeah tomorrow it's Yom hash mullion you know it's a God demand that our people sit in a Barcalounger in our underwear and watch TV and maybe take the kids to the beach later on and you know then he's got that innocent little face he's wearing the yarmulke we got to believe no we don't know what he's doing but no that's not true it shavoo out Shevat Shevat it's a the celebration of when God gave the law to the Jewish people so have a wonderful holiday and here's what I would like to talk about today is you know in the aftermath we've got a new shooting obviously in Santa Fe very always always a terrible atrocity they call it a tragedy but it's really an atrocity and we also have Friday's revelations that basically there was a spy the Obama administration planted this American college professor working in England he infiltrated the Trump campaign to see if there was Russian collusion going on and what I want to talk about in light of these two stories the story that that a second story broke on Friday the New York Times The Washington Post were being fed information by our intelligence agencies that they could so they could then spin it to get the intelligence agencies versions of this out there before people had a chance to actually think about the truth of it and that's what I want to talk about what I want to talk about is storytelling I want to talk about this is what we're fighting over the reason that every time there's a school shooting the the news of it the news cycle seems almost exactly the same each time it's not just because the events of course are terribly similar but it's also because we're fighting over story how the story is going to get told right and on the left they have this obviously absurd story that this is about guns it's always about guns just like saying that like the Jack the Ripper murders are about knives or the Boston Strangler killings are about hands and and you know I'd make a joke here about banning hands but since in London they've already banned knives I don't wanna give anybody any ideas and we say you know we say it's about different things what causes this what causes boys to do this and the you know let's take a look at how this looks for a minute all right let's take a look at how it looks when we're fighting over story right there's a shooting and the press goes out and does what I think is just wicked they go out and interview these poor kids who have just been through this traumatic event and they show you on the video they show you the reporter going from place to place asking the parents for permission to interview the kids even so even so this is not the way you should be approaching children who've just been through a traumatic event but they do it and they catch this one girl and she says this and this goes viral I heard around four to five shots I don't know as soon as I figured out what they were I started to run to hide so students reported hearing the fire alarm first and then the shots is that what that kind of sequence of events for you know I heard the shots first and then the alarms went off after I hid no no we were all in a line and there were lots of lots of swats and police around they escorted us all out we were in a single-file line and we came down here to the Chevron I was thinking it was going to happen eventually it happens it's been happening everywhere I was ready to run out but my teacher told me to hide instead so that's what I did so here you have this lovely young girl obviously traumatized and she says I was expecting it I knew it was going to happen here why because the meet the left dominates the media and they sell the fact that this is a crisis that we're having when in fact murder is way way down as the ownership of guns has gone up the murder rate has gone way way down and there's even a new study that's about to be released from Florida Northeastern University saying the school shootings are down from the 90s so this is not necessarily a crisis that we're experiencing but of course if the story is that we've got to get rid of these nasty guns that we've got to get rid of your second Amendment rights if that's the story then we were totally justified in showing you this trauma and using your emotions you know if we had an honest news media they would just be telling us the facts this is what happened this is what it is they be letting the people this may be letting the story emerge from the minds of the people but instead they want to make sure that they've got this story right that they are telling you this story they want you to hear on the right we always have this you know the here are the facts here are the facts we always point at charts and graphs and we have you know try and explore why these guys do what they do Oliver North you know who is going to be the new head of the NRA I don't think he's quite ascended to the head the head of it but he's the incoming head of the NRA he goes on TV and he tries to sell the right wing narrative the right wing story here it is from Ollie north I think we've got is we're trying like the dickens to treat the symptom without treating the disease and the disease in this case isn't the Second Amendment the disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence they've been drugged in many cases nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they're young teenagers in most cases and they've come through a culture where violence is commonplace what we need to do is turn on a TV go to a movie if you look at what has happened to the young people many of these young boys have been on ritalin since they were in kindergarten now I am certainly not a doctor I'm a marine but I can see those kinds of things happening you know I have to tell you I like Ollie Northeast Oliver North he's really good spokesman I'm sure he's gonna do a great job at the end right but obviously a crying child telling you an upset child telling you that she was expecting she was going to school every day expecting to be gunned down when the guy came in she wasn't surprised at all that's a more powerful story than what he's saying we're you know going off running off a series of reasons I've been a professional storyteller all my life this is how I've made my living I've been a novelist I've been a screenwriter and even the Sat our videos I do on YouTube are a kind of storytelling and when we're fighting over the story you know I've talked about this before but there are different genres of story it's important to see this and I hear a lot of people say why can't the right why can't Conservatives tell stories as well as the left why to the left they make their movies and they make avatar and they basically get us to pay them their stories are so good they get us to pay them for the propaganda now the thing is you have to understand that we're fight not just fighting over what the story is we have different ideas of what a story is okay there are different genres of story different qualities of truth to each story if I come in and I say to you Oh on my way to work a burning was the building was burning and I had to run in and rescue a child that story better be true right I mean otherwise I'm a liar but if I say to you once upon a time there was a man who had two sons you understand that I'm telling a different kind of truth and there are all kinds of deep thinking there's all kinds of deep thinking about storytelling Jordan Peterson is a union and he believes well maybe Jesus didn't really rise from the dead but this story tells a very important thing about the human consciousness and it's very important to tell this story to get at that truth I'm a Christian I believe yeah well I believe with what CS Lewis said yeah Christianity is a myth but it's a myth that actually happened it's a myth that happened in real life and that's what gives it its tremendous power so we have different ideas but the left has a totally different idea about stories they don't believe in actual moral truth this is what you always hear about this term moral relativism they believe that moral truth is created by those narratives that people believe in they don't believe in nations they said well a nation is just a story you tell a religion is just a story you telling it can be useful but it creates the what creates the truth is the way we behave so they actually think that by telling the story and getting you to believe the story they are creating the truth and that's why they bully you all the time that's why they say what do you mean a man can't be a woman a man can be a woman because they believe that if you will say that a guy puts on a dress and that turns him into a woman then that will be true okay that is why they are telling a different stories and they're holding themselves they're holding themselves to different standards of storytelling because because they think that this this is the way to create reality now here's the story that I want to tell about shootings okay to me guns are not about the Second Amendment is not about guns the Second Amendment is about freedom our founders understood that in order for you to be free for you to live your individual life speak your individual experience you needed to be free and the way they did that was not through democracy not by giving people to vote because they knew that democracy ultimately leads to tyranny they created a republic in which different powers were fighting with each other so the Senate fighting with the president that courts you know against the president and the Senate this is the way they did it and progressives have hated this from the beginning Woodrow Wilson said you know the president should be as powerful as he can imagine himself to be it makes no sense how can you how can you accomplish anything how can you accomplish anything Wilson said if all the powers are fighting with each other one of the powers two of the powers that they wanted fighting with each other with a federal government and the states and when the federal government said when the people writing the Constitution say it said the federal government is going to be in control of the army the state said we'll wait a minute if you get the army who's gonna protect us from you who is gonna protect the states from the feds and they said all right well here's what we'll do we'll make sure the populace can be armed we won't infringe the right to bear arms and then the states can arrange to have militias so they will have a line of defense but of course that logic also goes to the individual the individual needs a line of defense against the state against evildoers and that's how we maintain freedom in this conflict of powers all the time that is defended ultimately with guns the guns aren't about the guns the guns are about the freedom and if we tell that story when these shootings happen if we tell that story then it becomes very different because even if the guns contribute to school shootings the guns also protect our freedom and our freedom is non-negotiable all right our freedom is not negotiable it ain't about bump stocks it ain't about ar-fifteens it's not about semi-automatic weapons our freedom is non-negotiable in any way shape or form and see what we're the left does the right while we on the right don't always tell good stories is because we don't know which to tell we wanted to get people the facts and the facts are important but we also want to make sure that the narrative appeals to the human heart and mind and freedom does that all right let's talk about sense bird and you can't say sense bird it's not sending a bird it's like smell scen t-bird and you know how you go into a department store and some beautiful lady comes up and sprays you

fighting over the stories of this story that came out that a professor was paid by our intelligence people to infiltrate the Trump campaign and Trump is now calling for an investigation and they're saying oh that's terrible chill you know Trump can't interfere interfere with the Department of Justice the Department of Justice is part of the executive branch and Trump certainly can get involved with that the Congress is an independent branch right and so when they start to demand when Devin Nunez starts to demand information from the Department of Justice the Department of Justice should respond to that oversight and they don't so the intelligence community goes through the New York Times and they want to get this story out and spin it before anybody else spins it right so their headline is FBI used informant to investigate Russia ties to campaign not to spy as Trump claims that's the that is the New York Times telling you what the story is FBI used informant to investigate Russia ties to campaign not to spy as Trump clinic there's not even a headline that's not even a headline those are instructions on how to think on how to tell this you know speaking of storytellers Rob Reiner famous famous director the whatever they call meathead from all in the family goes on TV and says you know the you know the real problem is the real problem is the right owns the media this is what he says you're under attack the press is under attack and right now if you remove the ability to get the truth out then you're gonna have the destruction of democracy we don't have anymore there's no checks and balances from coming from the Congress right now the courts are holding but this is the first time in American history where you have a state-run television Fox brought the Sinclair and Alex Jones aligned with the President of the United States that's very very tough the battle lines have been drawn and we're gonna see whether or not democracy survives yeah so NBC ABC CBS CNN the New York Times The Washington Post are all speaking for the deep state but the real problem in Rob Reiner is mine this story teller mine because he is a storyteller he knows he knows if he can demonize Fox you know the left is so good at this they don't even have to argue with Fox they just make it so that Fox becomes a kind of curse word ah that's Fox News that's on Fox News that day you know that's Fox News doesn't matter no Fox could tell you the sky was blue and the left would come outside it's Fox News anyway this is the thing of controlling the story and that is what we have to learn to do because they do it so well all right however I will say this one of the things that I love that really that I love about politics is the hilarity of watching the left trip over its own narrative there is nothing funny I get you know if you can't have a sense of humor about absurdity should be following politics in politics the thing that I love about politics is the absurdity and the absurdity on the left is very strong the left hates Trump so much now that all Trump has to do is say black and they say white he says white they say black it doesn't matter so Trump comes out and you all heard about this Trump comes out and he says ms-13 are animals they're not people they're animals now this is ms-13 is a Central American gang their slogan is kill reap control but because Trump said it the left can't stand it and so they come out and they say well you can't cook you can't call people animals here is Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi rushing to the defense of the poor babies at ms-13 we believe that some of us who are attracted to the political arena and to government and public service that Joe we're all God's children and so when the President of the United States says about undocumented immigrants these aren't people these are animals you have to wonder that does he not believe in the spark of divinity the dignity and worth of every person calling people animals isn't that a good thing all right the spark of divinity and what I love about this is not only his Trump maneuvered Nancy Pelosi into defending people who beat children to death with baseball bats and eat the hearts of their victims so that's that's Nancy Pelosi's constituency from now on but now she's talking about a spark of divinity so here's my question when does this spark of divinity into the body okay because Nancy Pelosi is a big big abortion fan so when does I just want to know how this works technically I'm just I just want to ask the theology here when does the spark of divinity into the body because uh obviously not a conception obviously not when the baby is growing and when it becomes obviously a baby in a woman's stomach in a woman's womb not then it's not then is it after the baby comes out is that when the spark magically enters the body or do you have to join ms-13 first is that well that's what I want to know did you get do you get the spark when you're you know their their narrative is so crazy there was this case in Arlington Virginia doctor slipped an abortion pill into his pregnant girlfriend's T it caused the girl to have an abortion and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the crime a fetal homicide right now he's only gonna serve three years in prison I think it's yeah he'll serve only three years but it's fetal homicide so I asked myself the question why is it homicide when he does it but if she does it it's a woman's right to choose it's healthcare so I tweeted that over the weekend I said why is it homicide when he doesn't but it's it's healthcare when she does it and of course the left went nuts and they come after me and they start screaming don't you understand the meaning of that word consent it's about consent I thought you know I understand the meaning of the word consent but I also understand the meaning of the word homicide because homicide look it up it's the killing of a human being by another human being you can't consent to that it doesn't matter if I say you know oh my producer Rob made a mistake I can send to his killing you know go ahead go ahead take him out you know yeah and then they come and say well you know you killed Robyn yes but he had my consent to kill Rob you know so it's it's fine it's fine yes that's why and that is why when we see President Trump he brought back this reagan-era rule this is great that would pull federal birth control funds from clinics that sell abortion which means Planned Parenthood this could cost them in title what they call title 10 funds to the tune of about eighty million dollars a year and this you know this is a beautiful thing and when people wonder why no Trump has done bad stuff and he slept with a porn star and paid her off maybe you know all this stuff you think like yeah and and they make fun of evangelicals for supporting him because he hasn't lived an evangelical life maybe hasn't even lived a Christian life yes but he's doing this stuff when he does this stuff I'm sorry it's homicide its homicide if you can be convicted of poisoning a fetus in a woman's body if you can be convicted of homicide then it's homicide when she does it too it's homicide when she does it too and that's and that is you know that is the thing that is actually it's kind of delightful that the left has got itself tied itself in these knots and made itself so crazy that that they can't you know they can't get out of their own logic all right so let's go on to the Royal Wedding and in order to get to the Royal Wedding we have to talk to a man who knows about weddings and that of course is Princess Michael Knowles who was about to get married himself Michael Knowles who like me has a podcast here on The Daily wire let us bring on the the lovely the lovely in town there is there is you look you're looking lovely my dear this yeah I mean you would I come to you I have to tell you I had no idea I woke up was it Saturday I woke up on Saturday and I look at my Twitter feed and I thought oh there's a royal wedding like and you know you know you know you're my wife like you almost knocked me out I knew there was a royal wedding but I didn't I was not really paying paying attention but you are about to have a row it's a little different your wedding because with this it was a commoner actually marrying into royalty with you it's a princess dragging be dragged down and big dragged down into the seventh circle somewhere yes that's right although fortunately I think my wedding will be much more aristocratic and traditional than that travesty that occurred across the pond I can't believe you made me watch this thing it was it bad aye-aye-aye delayed watching it because the thing took place at 4:00 in the morning on the Pacific and so I woke a I'll just watch the highlights and that way I can avoid all of the craziness of course I end up getting sucked in I watch the entire thing it was one train wreck after another so just to paint the picture for you it opens up you're at st. George Chapel the British royal family the monarchy and what sort of hymns do you think are playing maybe oh Jesus we adore thee maybe's I don't know some beautiful chanting or something I don't wanna be my country they have beautiful hymns in England they do they are some of the most beautiful hymns so of course they selected stand by me by Benny oh yeah that was that's a beauty I said yeah it's a I think next time they're gonna do under pressure by Queen and David Bowie you know just to really loosen them by William Blake and stand by anything but they're both up there yeah yeah I don't maybe there's a dubstep remix of William Blake's yeah so that's how it begins then it either recessional or one of the songs after the ceremony was this little light of mine the Etta James version you just you think people said what you don't like Benny King you don't like Etta James I said you know I like all of these things they have other time and place I mean this is taking place in Windsor Castle it looks like an episode of Downton Abbey and maybe it down now be like exploded due to its highest level and they're playing this light a little light of mine yeah that's right I mean it really is that by the time we get to Prince Louie's wedding it's going to be Justin Bieber and but this gets into the entire theme of what's going on here which is the monarchy is modernizing that's what I love him that's why all of the media love this so then just - oh I know you missed it I'll give you the highlights so Meghan Markel lovely lass walks down in a flowing white dress listen these are modern eras I don't begrudge meg and markayla thing but she did walk down the aisle and pledge her undying eternal commitment to a man seven years ago and she was still married to that man five years ago oh man you're really picky so your your your allegation wear a white dress cuz she's not a virgin is that what you're well at least you know listen it's very uncommon to find a virgin around these days inside of the white dress industry sales of white dresses would drop to zero I think yeah but I think if you if you pledged your eternal love to a man seven years ago you were still married five years ago perhaps that just punctures some of the fairy tale but that's that's what the wedding was doing yeah so then on the royal family website this is what really got me because I don't mean to attack Meghan Markel she looks lovely she looked very beautiful the royal family website now has her website and has her page up and they quote from the new Duchess of Sussex which was I am proud to be a feminist yeah did you ever think you'd see the day in the world I weep I weep I weep I weep for Europe and the glory of Europe extinguished forever there then of course came the priest this was an Episcopal bishop named Michael Curry I can't even describe it for you do we have a clip of it no god those who do not love do not know God for god is love this power in love there's power in love to help heal if you cannot preach like Peter and you cannot pray like Paul you just tell the love of Jesus how he died to save us oh this way of love is the way they got it imagine this tired old world when love is the way when love is the way unselfish sacrificial redemptive when love is the way they know cow in this world ever again you know I saw this and the the Queen the look on the Queen's face was like she had just woken up and said what is this man doing in my chocolate how did he get with someone God's remove this man from my chapel right away the Queen's face was one of the highlights of it and even Prince Harry's you cut to be a sea Prince Harry is sort of vaguely smiling you know I don't know but by the way I think that is what Jesus tells us in the scripture right is no child will go to bed hungry in the future no he says the poor will always be with us alright well we'll have to check it out you know this started I lived in England for seven years as you know I mean I lived it over there a long time and while I was there Princess died died and she was in that horrible car accident and all this and you can't I cannot tell you what it was like I mean the weeping in the streets the flowers piled up us outside the palaces I mean just and you think of the British is a stiff upper-lip gang you know you think of them as the guys who withhold their emotion but suddenly there was this out point and she really did a lot to bring you know I want to say to bring the monarchy down but he brings as she was the people's princess exactly she brought she popularized monarchy and I knew people then older people the British would say you know the problem was when the Queen gave a tour of Buckingham Palace on television that's when she let them in you know and so and so they've seen this happening and they're very it's they're very uncomfortable with it I mean it really has changed it has not only changed the face of the monarchy the monarchy changing has changed the face of the people to a far more sentimental lot than they yes that's exactly right and it's so sad to see the British become sentimental because what is happening what we're seeing here especially from the time of Princess Diana is the monarchy is modernizing but people like the monarchy they like the aristocracy they like fairy tales and when you modernize you take away the entire purpose of the monarchy you know this is what I was gonna say to you because you're saying it was a travesty and all the stuff but I was over our friend Jonathan Hayes house and his wife Erica was playing this on TV and she was transported by me she was transferred she loved it yeah they well absalom erik ins have always loved the royal wedding I will say the only thing I should say because I'm being a little tongue-in-cheek on the travesty you know there there are a lot many more egregious ceremony elsewhere but there was a wonderful cellist this guy Sheikh who kind of Mason he played up rail Rev he played Schubert's Ave Maria and you know you don't say this was an amazing thing except compared to Benny King this guy was transcendent this guy was descended from heaven and but you're absolutely right when you talk about Erica they love this they've always been obsessed by the way there are reports of Americans being obsessed with the royal wedding since Victoria since Victoria got married and I know there were something like thirty million Americans watched even though it happened early in the morning air B&B reported 42,000 visitors to its places in London a 1400 percent increase in tourism in the surrounding towns so yes Americans love this thing we've always gone crazy for the royal weddings for william and kate's for Princess Diana's with Charles didn't last that long but you know they liked it when they got married but this was no exception they they loved it this was the deconstruction of a royal wet it's the deconstruction of monarchy and aristocracy did you see that race hustler al Sharpton said that this this wedding mattered because it was the last breaths of white supremacy I did I didn't see you see I didn't even know my wife told me like two days ago that Meghan Michael was half black and I was like what it's just look at her because you're supposed to look at the monitor again say oh this is a fairy tale this is a princess but these people just see it in these very modern divisive terms and the mainstream media they loved that aspect of it yeah yeah yeah listen I got to interrupt you for just a moment here to talk about Peter Millar I know you like their clothes as much as I do they are just really terrific they started out I think just making one single cashmere sweater but they've now grown into a premium American lifestyle brand featuring a wide range of casual sportswear tailored menswear and luxury performance golf apparel you know I don't play golf but the way these things fit they have this comfort fit quality and style and they're setting the standard for menswear you know it's it really is I've been I've been getting some of this I've been getting some of their material some of their stuff and you can just put it on and it fits everything if they don't have to be out in the golf course you would be anywhere you want you and it just feels comfortable and it doesn't you know it doesn't get out of shape and it makes you look great the performance polo is really beautiful I love that stuff it's an incredibly comfortable shirt and you can say that about almost everything that comes from Peter

have when you are drinking leftist tears come on over to the daily wire calm so women just they just love a royal wedding and they love a fairytale so why is it that Disney is under fire for doing fairy tales then they say they're not gonna do it any that is exactly at the right point the you know it's the person who's written best about this is actually your daughter faith more she does great work on this over at PJ Media I mean she she loves the Disney Princess stories and she hates that they're being family you know feminists teased or whatever you want to call it they're being like yeah they're being already destroyed by feminist complaints about them absolutely right she's seeing something in these Disney movies that is absolutely reflective of the society more broadly which is these Disney movies now have gotten rid of Prince Charming because it's so infantilizing for the women it's not empowered enough for the princess to want her prince charming you see this in the recent Disney movies the recent Disney movies don't have the traditional romantic love story they don't have the princess longing for her prince there are different kinds of love personified here there's sisterly love and motherly love is that film Moana doesn't even have a love interest doesn't even have a prince and that looks like coming down the pike they're not going to have that in the future and it we're seeing the same thing at Disney that we're seeing in the monarch and the actual monarchy which is oh we can't have those silly old traditions we can't have those silly old who wants that who wants that every woman on planet earth that's who wants that yeah well I don't why don't women ever get and maybe they do I shouldn't say this I mean certainly they do on our side of the fence but I mean women should be upset that feminists are telling them not to be themselves that's right and then I'll just become a sort of man yeah and and also and also like oh you have this desire inside you no no no that's not that does I we want you to add we don't wait you know I always I always quote and remind people that Simone de Beauvoir one of the founding feminists said that being a homemaker should be outlawed and she said because if women had that choice they would make it if too many women would make it which is to say that basically we should be in control of your desires and your yearnings and your does you know what you want out of your life instead of you being out of control white I don't understand why Disney is listening to this isn't this gonna cost the money well you would think it would cost the money and I will point out over time there have been a few Disney releases in the last couple of years the biggest box office is Beauty and the Beast especially domestic box office is Beauty and the Beast a traditional love story all of the other ones tangled Moana even frozen all of which did pretty well but they they couldn't really touch Beauty and the Beast and now Planned Parenthood is saying that we need a Disney princess who's had an abortion that's going to be their next move that's that's what I'm waiting for I'm standing outside the theater right now I've got my ticket I'm a holding might take it take an anticipation of seeing that that story you know one of the things faith writes about faith more over pj media writes about when she's writing about disney's is that they take it all so literally you know they talk about Beauty and the Beast like she really wants to marry a monster and they talk about marrying a prince as if that's really just marrying into royalty when we should we Americans shouldn't care about royalty but it's all symbolic I mean at all it all shows it shows you that women love the kind of animal side of men but they also civilize the animal side of man that is the story of Beauty and the Beast that she falls in love with this animal man but by falling in love with him she also turns him into a human being it's the story of me and my fiance sweet little ELISA I of course I mean I think maybe it's a you you'll be turned from a beast and I've seen absolutely a no sign of it so far but I'm hoping that will happen Michael Knowles thank you very much for coming on I'm glad you watch this because I didn't want to and I it was you know it was a important to look at and see aristocracy just become democracy and fill us all with that modern malaise but c'est la vie c'est la vie well thanks very much Noel's it's good to talk to you you know the thing about this is that it really is a fairy tale when they when they have these weddings and people should be allowed to enjoy that I don't see why that's a problem and I don't see even conservatives who are kind of making noise and saying oh well we're you know we broke away from Britain so we shouldn't have to watch this but no this just symbolizes the prince symbolizes an ID an ideal man the aristocracy the monarchy symbolizes the fact that a woman wants to be treated as a princess wants to be treated as an elevated kind of person these are not these are not bad things these are human things this is part of our story part of who we are and I don't think I think the left has been just trying to browbeat us out of our human nature browbeat us out of our sexual nature browbeat us out of our genders and I don't see why we should let them I do not see why we should let them and I don't see why companies like Disney even count out to them at all all right it's time for our crappy culture so I have to I've been getting some letters because of my podcast that people want me to stop making fun of Devon noon is his name okay now I noticed and my wife noticed that for a long time people didn't know how to pronounce Devon known as his name so every time you'd go on a different show P Nunez in unions in the Union in 99 you knew and I was watching all these different guys and I started think what's the name look up his name what is it so I started making jokes about and people were upset apparently saying non on nu nu is a no-no and I think the you know they started to say that the the joke was old and had lost its newness or Nunez or nonno or whatever it is and you know I think I think the thing thing is I understand that these are serious times and as conservatives we want to be serious people and talk in a serious voice like I'm talking and now because otherwise if we're silly and we're making jokes we might start laughing and giggling and having a good time and then you know if somebody's walking by the conservative room and they hear us in there having a good time they might want to become conservatives and we certainly wouldn't want that you know we don't want people joining us because being a conservative is great and it has a lot of fun but the thing the thing that bothers me about this is that no one complains when I call George Stephanopoulos George suckle up against no nobody ever complains about that and that nobody complains when I make the joke that Donald Trump has so erased the legacy of Barack Obama although he hasn't erased the legacy of spine and corruption but that's erased the legacy of regulation and even Obamacare is on his last legs and I say you know he's erased the legacy of Rama or O'Hara or whatever his name was and nobody ever complains about that so what they're really complaining about is that I'm making a joke about one of ours Devon Nunez has been heroic you really ask I mean heroic may be overstating it but he has been terrific in hunting down the papers and the documents that expose this infiltration of the deep state into the campaign of Donald Trump and when I say the deep straight state I'm not talking about some imaginary conspiracy I'm talking about this administrative state that progressives have put in to defend government action from the voters this is a group of people who can don't get elected and yet they make regulations that have the force of law and we can't get Adam and the intelligence community is part of that and Devin nine is or nine or whatever his name is has actually done a terrific job so I'm actually not making fun of him I'm just being a little silly because nobody knows pronounce his name and the bigger issue here the bigger issue here for me is following people instead of principles this is how the left got themselves in trouble they thought Barack Obama was the second coming they didn't even believe in the first coming and they thought Barack Obama was the second coming and so whatever he did was fine silence your political opponents with the IRS fine spy on a political campaign fine and the problem with that is it comes back to bite you when people start to say you know okay well you did it well we're gonna do it too I mean this is what you get with sexual malfeasance you know Teddy Kennedy left a girl to drown and yet the left continually told us he was the Lion of the Senate he was the Lion of the Senate you say yeah and not so much he was actually a guy who left his mistress to drown because they were following people instead of principles and I think it's true of us too I think Donald Trump has actually is actually shading over into being a great president but he's not always such a good person I mean the things we don't have to say that it's a good thing that he slept around we don't have to say it's a good thing he cheated on his wife over the weekend I was at a place that's very nice lady she was kind of scolding me about saying things like this and she said well you know Donald Trump is an alpha male and I said to her you know alpha male is a category of it's not a category of human being an alpha male is a category of ape and to me to me cheating on your wife when she's pregnant cheat on your wife at any time to be honest with it it's not a sign of being an alpha male it's a sign of really not being able to control yourself to me the alpha male is the guy who knows how to control all his urges and actually is his has his soul in control of his body so all I'm trying to say here is yeah I make silly jokes I do I'm here to have a good time I'm here to be entertained I think if you watch politics and you don't think the absurd is fun you're just going to be miserable so I I do make these jokes but it's not about the people it's not about the people it's about the principles and remember the whole point of all we're doing is this country and our freedom that is the story that we are telling we are telling the story of this great country and it's great freedom but we don't have to lie we can tell that story straight because it's true all right I'll see you again tomorrow I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show thanks for being here
