opening I would support it but I want to explain to you why you would not senator Rubio my daughter running down the hallway at Marjorie snails and Douglas were shot in the back yes with an assault weapon the weapon of choice yes okay it is too easy to get it is a weapon of war the fact that you can't stand with everybody in this building and say that I'm sorry Fred Guttenberg joins me now Fred everyone has been thinking about you and praying for you and hoping that you and your wife are sustained at this terrible terrible tragedy this moment the loss of your daughter tell us how you feel after that session with the Marco Rubio last night and after what you saw the president say I feel optimistic after last time because of the kids these kids have been heroic they've been spectacular and you're open I think I heard someone refer to them as victims maybe they were referring to me as a victim I'm not sure these kids are heroic they're not victims the only victims are the 17 which included my daughter who were hunted and killed murdered at their school I'm horrified by the inability of people who have an agenda to not simply say the truth to not simply acknowledge how my daughter died I am optimistic though by that slight little bit of movement by senator Rubio if he can come along the way and be a part of the solution I'm gonna put my arms around him and tell him I love him because honestly I'm not into this for I'm not a politician I'm a dad who lost his kid oh we should go you know and as I said on a program earlier today I start my days now at a cemetery all I want to do is fix this these kids who are fighting their hearts out who are showing us what makes America great we need to do something how do you feel when you hear these proposals to arm the teachers given what was going on in that school during the crisis what what difference would it have made if teachers had had weapons it would have been worse Andrea unfortunately I'm been briefed on some of the film from the hallways that took place during that massacre you had pandemonium yet kids running all over teachers running all over everyone trying to get to a safe place you would have had a shootout with all these kids and people running all over that would not have saved lives it would have led to further loss of life do we need to have more security in the schools train security you bet you but teachers need to teach kids need to learn and security needs to secure I I'm I'm shocked at what is being proposed I am shocked that it continues to get repeated however I am optimistic that it will be treated as it should which is a no starter David hog one of the young men one of the young leaders of this youth movement has been vilified online there have been ferocious attacks against him saying that he's an actor that he's been put up to this how do you and others counteract that how do you feel when you see one of these kids being treated this way online and perhaps manipulated by Russian BOTS or others well the truth and listen I I'm not I've almost seen no news this week it sort of I've gotten back out into the world as of last night so I'm not so sure about the Russian bot part of this but I can tell you about the kids and I can tell you about the young man you're talking about who is heroic who is on a single-minded mission to simply ensure the safety of the place where he goes to learn for anyone to call him an actor or any of the other kids and actors who wasn't there who didn't lose friends who didn't lose educators listen I'm a brutally honest person but anyone who says that it's an idiot okay and they don't know what's going on and they haven't met these kids who have stood up to everybody okay may have stood up to everybody to simply fight for a safe place to get taught they are not actors they are heroes Fred sadly tragically you're not alone in this because there are other parents who've experienced this before and I wonder if you can stay with us I want to bring in Mark Martin and he is a founder and managing director of Sandy Hook promise his seven-year-old son Daniel died in the 2012 Newtown shooting and Mark here was with the president in that room yesterday and he expressed why he thinks arming teachers is a mistake school teachers have more than enough responsibilities right now than to have to have the awesome responsibility of lethal force to take a life nobody wants to see a shootout in a school and a deranged sociopath on his way to commit an act of murder in a school with the outcome knowing the outcome is going to be suicide is not going to care if there's somebody there with a gun that's their plan anyway mark Barden joins me now mark could you could you talk to Fred Guttenberg about how to take this these tragedies and try to turn them into something that at least has some meaning for those who have been lost a Fred I am I am beyond words of what to say to you I have a little daughter on my arm this is my Natalie this is my James and this is my little Daniel who we lost at Sandy Hook elementary five years ago I'm just so sorry but but thank you for your voice and your advocacy please take care of yourself first and my heart absolutely goes out to you and just know that if there's ever a time that I can be of any comfort to you I'm here for you and we were in the White House appreciate that Fred what do you want to hear from the President and mark what do you want to hear now from the president who's obviously straddling this line between if we give him the benefit of the doubt trying to be responsive and and saying on his talking points I hear you thinking those those were written before the meeting but is clearly got a big both feet let's say in the camp of the NRA Fred first to you I want to hear the president be able to say the truth he gave a lengthy speech after the shooting most of which I can fully agree with but he left out the most important part of the speech and it's any discussion of the guns that were the weapon of choice I want to hear him acknowledge you can't use a car to cause this kind of destruction in the hallways of a school you can't run after these kids with a knife it won't cause this kind of destruction this weapon of war is the weapon of choice and I want to hear the president acknowledged that and I want to hear him be part of real solutions that show he actually cares about the kids in this country I don't want to be in this I guess position where I am probably coming on a little strong ly with people but but I buried my daughter a week ago I just I won't stop I will be relentless I won't stop until there's real common-sense reform that will prevent this from happening and again it is amazing to me Sandy Hook five years ago I believe and we're doing this again I want to hear the president be part of a real solution that says it won't ever happen again I will tell you I'm optimistic these kids they're gonna start running for office they will take care of it if no one else does but we might as well do this now we have no time to waste you can't have a tragedy like this again mark Barden I will say that to to their credit the president and his administration open their doors to hear what solutions are available to them I felt like myself and my colleague and friend Nicole Hockley were very clear with what we have been working on for five years we have come up with a model that we know that works it's not political it's not polarizing we don't charge for it we teach students how to recognize the warning signs someone at risk of harming themselves or somebody else and take the appropriate next step to get that person help before it becomes a tragedy we have done this we have been doing this we have seen it work we have students who have follow this model and actually stopped school shootings we have prevented suicides we have an anonymous reporting system in place right now that's connected to a call center with trained professionals who can triage those tips and stop a crisis or stop a tragedy before it happens we have these tools available right now we have introduced a bill has been introduced in the in the House of Representatives called the stop school violence act that will fund schools who want to train students how to prevent acts of violence we can do this right now and I told the president explained it to him very clearly yesterday this is a tool that you have you disposable or at your disposal right now and we're ready to help and we can do it now but how important is it to also do something about these weapons of war an age limit any further restrictions on the sale that's something that the president has not signed on to yet ok so there's all this debate over its mental health it's this it's that it's not an either-or situation here Andrea this is an emotional it's both it's both exactly it is it's all of it it's a huge problem it's not going away it's getting worse and it's not just mass shootings it's the daily gun violence that's taking lives in our cities across this country every day that we need to address so any little thing that we can do to help bring those numbers down and save those lives we have to do it it's not one or the other it's everything we have to do it in the name of Daniel in the name of Jamie and all of the others and all the others yes Fred Guttenberg our hearts are with you and your wife and your son and and the whole extended family and of course the families of Newtown as well hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC
