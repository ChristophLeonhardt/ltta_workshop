calling this room oh it's a bloody cool
place okay we don't need a pool just yet
shit this is mad I'm really liking this
now oh my god she's been in a coma for
several month it's the CIA we see you
what the CIA oh I told you girl is

so where is she that's weird
this is a room she should be here shit I
jumped up the wind out of the window
that's impossible we're on the fifth
floor she couldn't go out the window
call it in that girl cannot get away oh
my god where I might I've really got the
window I what caution bears next to oh
my hair now oh no no no no no
oh it's the beginning of the game it's
the beginning of the game when this guy
finds me man all right man it's the
beginning of the game remember ah she
mad the look how many options there are
50 subsets told the truth to Stan okay
that was when we were round the dinner
and we we told the truth
31 percent did what it took for money oh
shit okay so I stole from the cash
machine
92% got enough money for a hot dinner
that's good 40% help the homeless after
dinner yeah that's what I did 93 percent
saved everyone from the fire there was
an option where someone died or thank
God
62 percent didn't attempt suicide oh my
goodness 97 beat up the thugs oh shit
there's a 3% that you couldn't shit
37% did not talk about I did mm-hmm okay
I don't actually mean to do that 45
percent did not escape the building yeah
I messed up the QuickTime events my bad
that was quick toddlers are hard 56
percent didn't learn the fate of the
thugs oh so it was the thugs who burned
down the building I'm guessing so if I
did those quick time events and escaped
the building I would have found that out
okay my bad guys anyway yeah I think
we've got time for one more level I
think it's really bad if I ended the
video right here but yeah let's do one
more level
