1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,474
- [Crowd] Replace us.

2
00:00:02,474 --> 00:00:04,610
You will not replace us.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,920
You will not replace us.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,580
- My first encounter was with

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,180
the National Socialist Movement,

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,791
which is the largest
Neo-Nazi group in America.

7
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:19,640
(eerie high-pitched notes)

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,071
After that, I started traveling with

9
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:25,189
some various Klan groups, and then I met

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,690
Matthew Heimbach, who became
the main character of my book.

11
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:35,720
(eerie high-pitched notes)

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,890
- Our movement is about
securing the existence

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,060
of our people, and a
future for white children.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,680
All of us are engaged in this struggle.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,670
And much like a military, there
is positions for everyone.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,853
- Many other people, they
come from poor, rural,

17
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:55,390
and predominantly white
parts of America, Appalachia.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,170
And they look around and
they see that their neighbors

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,020
and their friends are suffering
under opioid addiction,

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,959
that they have no jobs, and no prospects,

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,110
and they kind of extrapolate from that

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,470
then that must be what it's like

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,080
for white people all over.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,940
They don't have the ability
to kind of lift their gaze

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,860
a little bit, because if they did,

26
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,990
I think they'd see that
white people on the whole,

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,470
especially white men, who this movement

28
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,440
is mostly consisting
of, have it pretty good.

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,140
The gatherings are a lot smaller,

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,120
and you know, that's the inherent problem

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,170
in the far right, sort of alt-right.

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,820
It's a movement, which in large part,

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,340
exists online with
anonymous Twitter avatars.

34
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,103
(eerie, haunting music)

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,020
With the Internet, with social media,

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,393
it becomes that much easier to

37
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:02,893
have your opinions reinforced.

38
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,760
And once you try to translate that into

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,330
real world action, it becomes difficult.

40
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,040
I was at Charlottesville where they were,

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,780
I would say around 400
people, which is by far

42
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,190
the largest gathering I'd ever been to.

43
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,640
And I'd been to dozens of these things.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,480
Yes, there has been a mobilizing effect,

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,553
and I think people are emboldened but

46
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:28,830
even so, they're still struggling
on how to translate this

47
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,310
into an actionable, physical movement.

48
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,040
The current crop of politicians
are doing any favors,

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,790
I think they're feeding into this as well,

50
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,630
so it becomes this pretty toxic place

51
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,680
where it's easy for this kind
of rhetoric to grow even more.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,840
- You know the side.

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,710
There was a group on this side,

54
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,020
you can call them the left,

55
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,590
you've just called them the left,

56
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,990
that came violently
attacking the other group.

57
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,476
- You know there was a rally in Boston

58
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:55,989
after Charlottesville, where I think

59
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,820
five or six Nationalists came out,

60
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,050
and a few thousand
counter-protestors came out.

61
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,620
There are rays of light in this thing.

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,110
Just recently, a guy, a former Hammerskin,

63
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,590
which is the most extreme
part of the Skinhead movement,

64
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,390
texted me and said he left the movement.

65
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,790
And that he might want to
help others leave, too.

66
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,320
So as awful and abhorrent
as their ideology

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,500
and politics is, some of them can change.

68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,840
Some of them can turn and come back to us.

69
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:38,646
(melancholy guitar)

70
00:03:38,646 --> 00:00:00,000
(clicking)
