BC has just banned the world's most closely managed to grizzly bear hunts for no real reason other than feelings this isn't going to end well because it never does BC is ending there grizzly bear hunt throughout the entire province this comes on the heels of an August 2017 announcement that the province would be ending trophy hunting of grizzly bears and also stopping the hunting of grizzly bears in the Great Bear Rainforest but let's be clear here despite the BC government's protestations to the contrary the hunt really isn't over not really it's just becoming a race-based hunt First Nations and aboriginals will still be able to hunt bears for food social and ceremonial reasons or to exercise their treaty rights for me a dead bear is a dead bear is a dead bear either you're against dead bears or you're okay with a few dead bears which I am and I'll explain that in a minute but the rates of the person who killed the bear shouldn't really factor into it the bear is still dead at the end of it all but even more whacky than making a race-based hunt of grizzly bears is the reasoning for creating a race-based hunt the reason feelings the race-based hunt is based not on ecology not on biology not even on facts it's purely emotional and I'm not kidding I'm not exaggerating BC forest minister Doug Donaldson said it's mostly a social values issue when it comes down to it this species is seen as an iconic species for BC and people just weren't willing to accept the hunting of grizzly bears anymore in this province social values is just another way of saying social license which is just another way of saying feelings are more important than facts so let me inject some facts into this discussion because as Ben Shapiro says facts don't care about your feelings BC currently has a grizzly bear population of roughly 15,000 animals these bears are closely monitored as closely monitored as any bears on the face of the planet in fact according to the same Ministry of forests that decided to disregard science in favour of emotion a 2016 report said BC has a very high level of rigor and adequate safeguards in place to ensure the long-term stability of grizzly bear populations and BC produced more DNA based population estimates for grizzly bears than any other similar jurisdiction in the world and while environmentalists and concerned animal rights activists like to paint the BC grizzly bear hunt as some sort of wild west free-for-all it's certainly not according to bears in BC calm the grizzly bear harvest has been consistently between 250 to 350 animals province-wide per year what that means is the harvest rate of the bear population is only at 2 percent which is far less than the maximum human cause mortality rate of 5 percent now those are often Bears hit by cars crossing the road and Outfitters and hunting guides NBC can charge upwards of 17 thousand dollars for a single grizzly hunting tour that's a huge economic injection into a rural community according to animal behaviorist auth marvel ringer who actually lives in the niccola Valley in bear territory the grizzly bear population in DC has been steadily growing and grizzly bears are being seen now in places like the Lower Mainland where they have been historically considered absent ok so those are the facts about BC grizzly bears let's talk about what happens when you have too many apex predators at the top of the food chain now apex predators have no natural predators when there are too many apex predators they begin to consume all the animals beneath them on the food chain that hurts the deer and elk populations first in a region and when the deer and elk populations and other food species begin to dwindle the apex predators start to starve and that's when apex predators get aggressive with people in 2015 near spar would be see there were four separate grizzly bear mauling incidents in one month in 2015 the amount of maulings in BC doubled from the year before as a hot dry summer and a poor berry crop left the Bears desperate for food and we know from the Yellowstone grizzly bear experience eliminating hunting season for bears can cause an explosion in their populations in Yellowstone bear populations have grown from fewer than 150 to more than 700 in 40 years they've been taken off a threatened species list within the park which could open the Bears up for responsible hunting now in Montana Idaho and Wyoming and remember that's a much smaller bear population than BC's but it's considered healthy and growing but we can also look at the Canadian experience Ontario banned to their spring black bear hunt for 16 full years Ontario was forced to bring it back in 2015 and then further expanded in 2016 after the bear population exploded in fact liberal cabinet ministers of all people cited concerns about human bear conflicts and bear hunting as tourism draws as a motivation to reopen the bear hunt in fact when the Liberals expanded the bear hunt in 2016 forestry Minister bill more said bear related concerns are a very real problem for people living in northern and central Ontario the BC NDP have thrown the very real and scientific concerns of people who have to live in bear populated areas into the garbage can to pander to downtown Toronto and Vancouver types who see the grizzly bears as cuddly iconic and apparently immortal be sea creatures instead of the apex predators that they are and if history holds true after a few mauled joggers and eaten dogs as the Bears continue to encroach on the Lower Mainland the government will have to open the hunting season up again and maybe even call the Bears themselves in the interests of Public Safety the BC government will create a problem then spend your tax dollars to fix the problem and then claim to be problem-solving heroes as governments tend to do and if the government has to call the Bears that brings no economic benefit to the communities who rely on hunting and guiding as vital parts of their local economies remember each bear is worth at least $17,000 in a local economy and the left will continue to blame for I don't know being alive and living where the wildlife roams like for some sort of plague on the face of the earth trading the safety and local economies of rural folks for urban feelings and those who sit in downtown Vancouver coffee shops sipping on overpriced lattes while ignoring history will be doomed to repeat it for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun reads did you know that I have my own weekly full-length show here at the rebel it's
