1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,440
As of 2015, the international poverty organization,
Oxfam, has calculated that the world’s richest

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,560
1% has more money than the other 99% of the
population combined.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,529
What’s even more shocking, is that just
62 individuals have amassed the same amount

4
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,140
of wealth as is possessed by half of all the
people on Earth.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,779
So, we wanted to know, just how rich is the
1%?

6
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,039
Well, the severity of the world’s wealth
inequality is actually a relatively recent

7
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,230
development.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,170
Just six years ago in 2010, nearly 400 people
controlled as much money as the bottom 3-and-a-half

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,170
billion.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,820
Today, those 400 are now just 62.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,980
Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the
poor have gotten considerably poorer, and

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,000
the rich have exploded in wealth.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,670
Today’s Top 62 have seen their assets increase
by 44% while the bottom half of the population

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,830
has lost about 41% of their resources.

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,990
The Top 62 now control nearly $1.8 trillion
dollars, about half a trillion more than they

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,340
had in 2010.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,089
But wealth inequality isn't only concentrated
at the top.

18
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,089
One report by Credit Suisse calculated that
although wealth inequality had been steadily

19
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,089
dropping before the financial crisis, it has
rapidly reversed course in the years since

20
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:08,089
2009.

21
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:09,960
The United States has seen more than 900 new
millionaires just between 2014 and 2015, while

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,330
median wealth in the US has stayed constant.

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,400
So, what does it mean to be among the richest
people in the world?

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,690
Well, due to overwhelming poverty worldwide,
the top 10-percent starts at those with assets

25
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,570
worth roughly 70,000 dollars.

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,820
In developed, Western nations, this is generally
considered a middle to upper-middle class

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,030
salary.

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,720
Most homeowners would easily fall into this
category.

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,070
Narrowing it further, many homeowners would
actually fall into the 1% worldwide, which

30
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,560
generally includes those controlling more
than 750,000 dollars in assets.

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,120
So how can the world rebalance this wealth
inequality?

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,020
Well, Oxfam recommends a number of steps.

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,220
They suggest raising wages, paid for by executive
bonuses and to push for better women’s rights

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,590
and pay equality.

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,840
Additionally, they recommend ending the revolving
door between wealthy elites and government.

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,040
But, perhaps most importantly, they suggest
closing the world’s tax havens, which hold

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,780
an estimated $7.6 trillion dollars, and do
not contribute back to the countries where

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,159
that money came from.

39
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,380
Despite the global economic crisis being,
in part, caused by risky financial decisions

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,400
by the banking and housing industries, many
in those industries have seen their fortunes

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
skyrocket.

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,350
The use of quantitative easing to stabilize
the economy, involves governments investing

43
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,670
huge sums of money in banks.

44
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,410
Much of that money has been sent into executive
bonuses and stock markets, which have risen

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,500
dramatically since the recession further contributing
to the Top 62.

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,200
Meanwhile, though they may be in the top 10-percent
worldwide, those who were left unable to pay

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,060
their mortgages and lost their jobs as a result
of the crisis have seen little financial recourse.

48
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,790
America’s middle class has been through
a lot over the past decade, with many suggesting

49
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,490
that it is slowly evaporating.

50
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,250
So, just how powerful is the Middle Class?
