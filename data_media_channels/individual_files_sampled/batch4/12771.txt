so the number one question that I that I hear when I travel around the country and I meet people at speaking events and that kind of thing by far without a doubt the number one question I get is how do you deal with all the hatred I guess people have noticed that I tend to attract quite a bit of vitriolic hatred a lot of people don't like me and they are very eager to let me know that they don't like me and to let me know every day all day constantly and in very strong terms now bring out the violin and I'll tell you more of my sad tale no I I mean I'm not the only one I probably attract a higher volume of it than most people just by the nature of what I do for a living but I'm certainly not the only one I'm sure you have noticed this as well in your own life that if you try to speak any kind of truth whatsoever people are gonna come after you and you're gonna deal with it online and in the real world and I assume that when people ask me this question the reason I get it so often is that people are looking for insights they can use in their own life not because they want to hear my life story so I'm gonna try usually what I'm asked this question the answer that I provide is I think unsatisfactory because I just I'm put on the spot but now that I've had time to think about it I want to try to answer it again and I think the first thing that we have to do if we're gonna talk about how to deal with the hatred from the world the backlash that you get from defending your belief system first thing we have to do is reiterate again and understand and embrace and accept that it absolutely will happen you will get this hatred we know this we know it from our own personal experience we also know it from Scripture Jesus warns us about this repeatedly and his warning certainly apply to our culture probably more than most but they do apply to all cultures throughout time now that's true but on the on the other hand and so it seems almost counterintuitive because we also are a culture of indifference people are lazy apathetic indifferent and you would think if you didn't know any better that one of the advantages of living in a lazy apathetic and different culture is that you can say and do whatever you want and nobody will pay attention or care because they're all too busy watching their five hours of TV a day and they're online and there you know obsessed with movies and video games and everything and they're too immersed in that world to even care what you're saying and that is true most of the time most of the time you can say what you want and do what you want and nobody will care because part of that that's why so many people will will say you know hey let people do what they want as long as they're not hurting me it's fine and they feel like that's some sort of virtuous moral code to live by so right well I don't you know as long as they're not hurting me I don't care I let people live live and let live right but everyone who really lives according to that motto it's just pure laziness on their part it's just because they don't care it's not it's not like this is not some virtuous restraint on their part they really just don't care about anything or anyone and they just want to watch TV that's what that means but here's a problem these people the average American who is living in this deluded world and is just entertaining himself into oblivion and I do believe this applies to the average American I know I'm taking a dim view of the average American but I'm sorry I think it's the reality this is how the average American works they're floating along on the current don't care about anything and they're just staring at screens not ever taking even a moment to really think about anything the only thing they're thinking about is what's the next show I'm gonna watch when can I get my video in the next video game what am I gonna eat you know that's what they care about and that's what they're thinking about so to live in this world of comfort and luxury and entertainment and moral numbness in order to really live in that world you cannot accept any truth every truth in your life has to become your own version of that truth because the truth has a hard edge you know and once you inject truth into your life well then now you have to kind of start conforming yourself around it and and you can't live tirely according to your own whims so if you want to live that way you must in the end reject all truth and we're seeing this play out in our culture so people that are in this fog of indifference if you come in and you inject any truth into that fog doesn't matter what it if you introduce any truth um that's when they're gonna detach themselves from the screen for long enough to devour you and rip you to pieces and then go back to what they were doing before when you threaten this indifferent lazy life that they're living which is the only thing they really care about when you threaten that when you interfere with it that's when they come after when you criticize when you when you cause them to look at themselves in the mirror when you criticize their precious sacred lifestyle because these days that's the one thing you're never allowed to do right you anything can be justified as long as it's my lifestyle I can say well this is my lifestyles how I choose to live so you can't criticize it actually I can criticize it because I think it's wrong just because it's a choice that you've personally made well it's a personal choice so that means it's right no I mean a lot of personal choices are wrong and I think it's wrong so I'm gonna tell you I think it's wrong I'm sorry but once you take that attitude in that approach that's when they will descend upon you and so then the hatred is inevitable in that case and it's going to be very very vicious so how do you handle it how do I handle it well the honest answer is I have historically handled it very very poorly I have to admit I'm trying to do better I'm working on it but I have handled it poorly and I but I have found through trial and error that there are three serious mistakes you can make when dealing with the hatred of the world and I have made all these mistakes so let's talk about the mistakes first the first mistake is the obvious one the first mistake is to take it personally and to be offended by it and hurt we should never allow ourselves to be personally offended by the sniping and the vitriol from the world particularly when that windows personal attacks come because you said something true never take a person it's illogical anyway because when someone comes after you and says the most awful things about you it's not personal now it may be about you you know on the surface what they're saying may be personal and they may be talking about you on the surface but really it's not they don't care about you it doesn't matter what you you don't matter it's what you said that they hate it's your belief system it's the conviction it's the thing that you said the position that you took that's what they hate and because they're too lazy and they lack the intelligence and the energy to engage the belief system itself they will instead take the lazy shortcut approach and attack the person who holds the belief because that's the easiest thing to do they don't want to apply their minds at all or expend the energy required to listen to what you're saying and then try to refute it so instead they'll they'll listen for long enough to understand that they disagree and then they'll just they'll just try to rip you apart personally maybe bring your family into it whatever they can do to hurt you and shut you down and make you afraid and then they can go back to what they were doing before I will admit that I made this mistake early on when I first started doing this when I first gained an audience online and I was giving my opinions to a relatively large group of people the first couple of times that I experienced a massive blowback at backlash for something that I said well you know it's hundreds and thousands of people that are attacking you there's hate mail there's comments everywhere and it's just first couple of times I'll admit that I was overwhelmed and and I did let it get to me and I read some of the comments and I did take them personally I know we're not supposed to admit this but I did earlier it's it's it's a difficult thing you know when you're when you're not used to it it can be very hard so I made that mistake don't make that mistake second mistake is on the opposite end of the spectrum the second mistake is to enjoy the hatred there are people that they get the hatred the blowback and their first reaction is to recoil from it and to be kind of afraid of it and that's that's normal now we have to overcome that reaction but it's a normal human reaction but then there's the people who and these are internet trolls basically this is this is this is what ends up a person like this with this reaction could eventually become an internet troll an infamous internet troll that's someone who thrives on the negative attention and likes it there are a lot of people in the pundit commentator class conservatives and liberals who that's that's the case for them they really like to be hated because it's attention it is it's a lot of very energetic attention directed at them and they like that now me I've also made this mistake at the beginning experienced the blowback I was overwhelmed I was I was taking it personally and so then I thought well the best defense mechanism is to try to like it somehow and so I tried that as a defense mechanism to shield myself I tried to put on this thing of you know well I'm living rent-free in your head you know and and and to really take some sort of pleasure in it it didn't last for me because it didn't come naturally to me so I couldn't stay like that for very long but I did try it and what I can say is that thriving on hatred is as bad as being hateful yourself it's probably worse really to actually enjoy it it's a sick demented thing but there are a lot of people in that camp that's a mistake the third mistake is the mistake that I settled on for a long time which is to be numb to it I'm very guilty of this third mistake of you know being afraid of the hatred and not enjoying it either but just feeling nothing much of the time and I think most people think this is the right approach you hear people all the time declare oh I don't care what anyone thinks I don't care about any I don't care what anyone thinks and we sometimes will confuse this attitude with strength well then well that's what it means to be strong is to not care what anyone thinks right isn't that what we always say well you shouldn't care what the world thinks don't care about it don't care about their opinions but that's not strict if you really don't care it's kind of like a sociopath who has literally no fear or emotion at all cannot be courageous even when he puts himself in harm's way because fear is an element of courage courage is feeling the fear and acting anyway if you have no fear whatsoever then you cannot be courageous even if you're doing something that looks courageous you're only doing it because you don't have that reaction that natural human reaction of fear so being numb to the opinions of the world and being numb to the hatred well that doesn't make you strong that actually makes you weak that means that you've been worn down and beaten down and now you're just sort of this flat line of not feeling anything what I've realized is for after a long time of kind of taking this approach of saying well I really don't care what people think you even if I even if 50,000 people are saying the worst things about me I really don't care what they think I feel nothing after a while I realized that you know doesn't seem right I think I should care what they think I should feel something now the things shouldn't be fear it shouldn't be pleasure either on the other end of it but I should feel something right doesn't seem right to feel nothing I mean how can you feel nothing could he have swarms of angry people shouting at you and feel nothing that doesn't seem human and what I've realized is well I mean look at look at what the Bible says pray for those who persecute you turn the other cheek so that's what we should feel we should feel move to pray for them we should feel pity for them so we should care because not because we care what they think in the sense that we want to we want them to like us so we're gonna adjust our opinions to make them care or to make them like us but when people hate us I think we should care for their own sake because their wallowing and stewing in this hatred and we should pity them for that those are persecute you turn the other cheek we tend to gloss over these parts of Christ's teachings but what will be glut we grow up we basically gloss over everything is up but especially stuff like this we gloss over it because it's become kind of a cliche we've heard it so often especially turn the other cheek we heard so often it's become just kind of the part of the vocabulary part of the language and it's become a cliche that's the worst thing really that can ever happen to the Bible is when it becomes a cliche when we turn it into that which is what we've done if we're really worth if we really thought about it if we didn't gloss over it and we really confronted these teachings turn the other cheek pray for those who persecute you we would see that these are radical really challenging commands that Jesus is giving us really I mean this it's it seems almost crazy turn the other cheek what pray for people who are attacking me pray for them I think most people although we would we look at that and we say oh yeah sure turn the other cheek yeah that's great advice thanks Jesus thanks for that advice and we'll say aw yeah I do that all the time yeah definitely sure sure I think if we were to be honest we might we may look at our own lives and realize that we have never turned the other cheek we have never prayed for those who persecute us I realize at a certain point I realized that I looked at it and I said you know what I don't think I've got all these people attack me I don't think I've ever prayed for them ever I'd like to think that I have but I don't think I ever really have now part of the issue with there with with this with these aspects of Christ's teaching is that they seem at first glance to be kind of in contradiction they seem to contradict other things they said because this is also the same Jesus who famously fashioned a whip out of cords and drove the money changers out of the temple flipping over tables this was vandalism and assault he was assaulting people with a whip and turning over tables I mean it's this is it's a crime what he did right um this is also the same Jesus who says I did not come to bring peace but a sword dividing families this is the same Jesus who said that I wish you were either hots or cold and because you're lukewarm I spit you out of my mouth but Luke lukewarm is sin in it as a synonym for mild but other points it seems like he's telling us to be mild but not lukewarm telling us to turn the other cheek but yet over here he's flipping tables and using a a whip I mean it's just it seems like how do you make sense of all of it and you realize that you make sense of it this way then what Jesus is saying is when you personally are being attacked when your own personal honor is being assaulted or questioned that's when you turn the other cheek that's when you don't respond with this kind of force right when it's when you personally are the victim but when God is being attacked when your faith is being attacked when we're dealing with heresy and sacrilege and blasphemy when when truth is being attacked even when your family is being attacked well that's that's different then we are supposed to rise up and respond with force respond vocally even even respond even be militant in our defense of God's on and of truth and virtue and of good and holy things now we we tend to get this we tend to get this backwards I think a lot of times what we'll do is we'll see the world attacking God and our faith and truth and committing the sacrilege and heresy and blasphemy and that's when we say oh we'll turn the other cheek be the bigger man but then when when that one that when that when the hyenas when the pack of hyenas move on from there to us and they start personally sniping at us that's when all of a sudden we're not so willing to turn the other cheek and and and that's when we want to rise up in defense of ourselves but it's supposed to be the opposite because that is strength that's what strength is as being willing to you know put yourself in the midst of it and to two jump in to defend these things that are beyond you and above you and are bigger than you but when it comes to personal hatred and personal persecution and people coming after you personally that's when we're not supposed to muddy ourselves by flinging mud at the mud slingers or debase ourselves by trying to defend our own personal honor the people who don't really care about our honor anyway so there's no point forceful and vocal in our defense of God's honor and of truth and virtue but when it comes to personal attacks personal insults personal affront to those to those specifically Christ says turn the other cheek that's what a strong man does he doesn't cry he doesn't snicker like a little troll and find some perverse pleasure in it he isn't morally exhausted and numb instead he's resolute he's confident and he's uninterested in getting involved in bickering or back-and-forth and when people personally insult him he just he's not gonna get down there and try to say no I'm not that I'm not stupid you're stupid that's weak that's childish but he does feel something like I said he feels pity for his attackers he feels sorry for them he sees how pathetic the whole scene is how miserable these people are how empty their lives are and he prays for them he prays sincerely for them and Christ gives us the perfect example of this approach of course during his passion Father forgive them for they know not what they do he said that while he was nailed to a cross an unbearable agony and we're never going to attain that level of heroism and selflessness well we could still follow it and use it as a model and I think that many of us have never really tried this but it is possible to pray for those who attack you and I'm still like I said I am NOT the perfect model of this whatsoever so I don't put myself forth and say do what I'm doing instead let's do what Jesus does but I am trying and what I found is you know for me right now most of the time when I get personally attacks if I'm personally attack and if I turn around and pray for the person attacking me the prayer that I'm saying silently in my head is not 100% sincere I want it to be sincere but it's not because I'm still ticked off at the guy but I'm at least right now I'm just at the point I'm at the very beginning I'm just trying to form the habit anyway I'm trying to develop at least the habit of being attacked and the first thing is to respond by praying for the person and so right now it's it's not a hundred percent sincere I'm still it's very novice level stuff I think that's what we have to do a lot of times in life is even if your heart's not in it even if you're not feeling it do the right thing anyway do the right thing lead with your actions you know go through the motions at least in the beginning and then eventually your heart will start to change along with it especially when God sees you putting in the effort and really try it's like it's not enough to be really you know to be good to be good people I don't think we can leap all the way there first we have to really desire to be good and to do the right thing you we have to at least what we have to do with it maybe we need to desert we have to want to want to be good you have to want to want to do the the right thing I think that's the first step and once we take that first step then hopefully the rest will follow so right now I'm trying to develop the habit and so when people ask me how do I deal with the haters I guess the real answer is I'm working on it and maybe we could all you know work on this together because the other thing is look last thing I'll say is it's it's the only thing that works anyway you know this is also good practical advice like so much in the Bible these are moral truths moral commands but also on top of it it's it's just good sites it is also good practical advice for how to live it isn't merely that we can't turn the Bible into merely a collection of life advice you know so it's not just that but it is also that so when it comes to personal attacks it's like there's nothing else you can do anyway when people are personally insulting you to get down in the mud with them and to try to defend yourself it's just a no matter what that's that's how insults work that's sort of the point of them is that no matter what you say once you're insulted personally no matter what you say to defend yourself against that insult it's only gonna end up reinforcing whatever the insult was so there's no point it might as well just take the higher approach that Jesus is prescribing for us because on top of being the right approach it's also the only one that works alright thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening and have a great day I'll talk to you tomorrow Godspeed
