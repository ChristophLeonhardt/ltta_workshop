hello there i'm riyadh and before we get
into this I think this neckline is a
little bit offensive can I make this
smaller
in 2006 Michael Jackson was here in
Ireland he spent months and months and
months here and he stayed in Kiryat or
high dimension and that house is located
in the tiny tiny part of Ireland with a
population of about 10 people it is
called West me so even though I was
ridiculously sick I still said I would
go down with my family and six other
amazing families to spend an amazing
weekend in the countryside in Michael
Jackson's house here is how we got up
where
now working for they and their liquor to
the locals in West me so as you can see
I haven't gotten any better sympathy
sympathy sympathy Cheers
votes happy as hell because I am in the
house in one of the six bedrooms of
which bedroom - I get to sleep in
Michael Jackson's bedroom Michael
Jackson's floor Michael Jackson's bed
Michael Jackson blue lights Michael
Jackson's bathroom Michael Jackson's
pills he farted in that bed

believe you never heard I'm very popular
container what are you doing here I
can't what are you doing here

you I sorta battle the sickness I have
been taking pretty much every natural or
natural homeopathy act tick medicine
under the Sun clemency ibuprofen
echinacea erythema di sir bleach and
lozenges I love the word lozenge do you
want a lozenge can I have a lozenge
those love injures are deadly being
super sensible I relaxed last night
pretty uneventful life
nothing really happens
and being a city boy I think a lot of us
lads are denied a right of passage as
men I have filled that rite of passage
this weekend I climbed a mountain well a
big hill I watched a match and
contributed the ride of my life how many
burgers you go to one of these jungle I
went looking for I'm actually found
Michael Jackson's favorite tree in the
forest look at that
when trampolining with my mother in the
rain well I never go now and spend some
time with the six or seven families that
we came down with if you have a second
