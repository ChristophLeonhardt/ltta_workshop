Hello, I’m Wes Anderson.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,200
I’m the director and
co-writer of “Isle of Dogs."

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,520
[music]

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,670
So this is Atari, the
mayor’s ward

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,650
with the hero pack —

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,500
the pack of dogs who
he has befriended.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,490
And these men have come
to try to take him back

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,680
to civilization.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,300
He’s on a garbage dump
island at the moment.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,970
There’s a lot to keep track of.

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,250
There’s action happening up
in the sky and over there,

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,140
where the robot is.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,630
And from the beach side, the
men and Atari and the dogs here.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,805
When you’re doing
an animated movie,

15
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:43,920
you work from an animatic.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,590
You do a storyboard
version of the movie,

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,340
and you develop it that way.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,440
You make the movie
in sketch form,

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,990
but with sound and movement.

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,890
In a scene like
this, even if I was

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,840
trying to do it in
a live action movie,

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,340
I would work the same way.

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,030
I’ll just tell a bit about the
different devices and methods

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,330
we used to animate
all this stuff.

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,230
The landscape, we
wanted this dark area

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,330
where this is happening
and this whole hill

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,170
is made of like, miniature
cathode ray tubes.

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,020
The water is all clingfilm,
and what they call in England,

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,310
Saran wrap —

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,650
what I grew up saying.

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,270
And it’s just animated
to move like water.

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,040
The smoke and when they fight,
these clouds that happen,

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,370
are all done with
just cotton wool.

34
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,570
And also, the music became
a big part of this scene.

35
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,920
We have a score by
Alexandre Desplat.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,030
It’s very heavy on
percussion and saxophones,

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,180
and it became a big part
of what the scene became.

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,190
We also, throughout
the movie, we

39
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,220
have different things that
are happening on TV screens

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,510
or projected.

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,500
Those, we’ve all done
in hand-drawn animation

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,780
so the movie’s a
mixture of stop motion,

43
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,540
three-dimensional
photographed objects —

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,980
puppets — and 2D
hand-drawn animation,

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,960
for those parts of the story.

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,330
It takes a significant focus,
for me, to make it clear,

47
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,720
how everything is working
together spatially so you

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,240
can follow the action clearly.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,030
Now here, we go
into split screen,

50
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,790
and it’s a very good
technique, especially when

51
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,620
you have a scene with a
lot of visual information

52
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,460
that needs to be communicated
and you need to keep the pace.

53
00:02:49,460 --> 00:00:00,000
