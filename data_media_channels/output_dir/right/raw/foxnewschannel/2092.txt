1
00:00:00,924 --> 00:00:01,224
LAWS.

2
00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:03,360
MUST BUILD A WALL.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,562
ABBY, OVER TO YOU.

4
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:06,696
ABBY: THANK YOU, PETE.

5
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:08,365
WELL, A MAJOR BREAST CANCER

6
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:09,499
SCREENING MISTAKE.

7
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:11,868
UP TO 270 WOMEN IN ENGLAND

8
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:12,803
MAY HAVE DIED BECAUSE THEY

9
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:15,439
WERE NOT CALLED IN FOR THEIR

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:15,806
MAMMOGRAM.

11
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:16,807
HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE BLAMING

12
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:19,109
IT ON A COMPUTER GLITCH, BUT

13
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,410
HOW WILL THE GOVERNMENT RUN

14
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,111
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM DEAL WITH

15
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:22,479
THE BACKLOG AND COULD THIS

16
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:23,547
HAPPEN HERE IN THE U.S.?

17
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:25,282
JOINING US NOW IS BREAST

18
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:27,217
CANCER SPECIALIST DR. NICOLE

19
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:27,584
SAPHIER.

20
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:28,919
ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU,

21
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:29,252
DOCTOR.

22
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:31,254
THIS IS A PRETTY UNFORTUNATE

23
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:31,621
SITUATION.

24
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:32,322
LIVES WERE LOST.

25
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:33,223
HOW BAD IS THIS?

26
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:34,691
>> IT'S A TRAGEDY ANY TIME A

27
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:37,227
CANCER IS NOT FOUND ON EARLY

28
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:38,161
DETECTION OR SCREENING

29
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:38,595
PROGRAMS.

30
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:39,930
IT'S AN ABOMINATION WHEN IT

31
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,431
IS DUE TO A GOVERNMENT

32
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:41,998
COMPUTER GLITCH.

33
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,033
WHAT HAPPENED WAS IN THE

34
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,401
U.K., UNDER THEIR GOVERNMENT

35
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,168
SYSTEM, HAVE YOU TO BE

36
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:46,736
INVITED TO UNDERGO YOUR

37
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:47,437
CANCER SCREENING.

38
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:48,472
IT'S NOT A CONVERSATION YOU

39
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:49,506
ARE HAVING WITH THE DOCTOR.

40
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:50,841
YOU GET A LETTER THAT SAYS

41
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:52,542
YOU CAN GO AND GET YOUR

42
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:53,110
MAMMOGRAM NOW.

43
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,544
WHAT HAPPENED WAS A COMPUTER

44
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:58,248
ERROR IN 2009 MADE IT SO

45
00:00:58,248 --> 00:00:58,882
450,000 WOMEN DIDN'T GET

46
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:00,117
THAT LETTER AND THEREFORE

47
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:00,984
DIDN'T GET THEIR BREAST

48
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:01,651
CANCER SCREENING.

49
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,286
THEY ARE SAYING UP TO 270

50
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:04,921
WOMEN DIED FROM ADVANCED

51
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,223
BREAST CANCER.

52
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:07,591
PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT

53
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:08,558
UNDERGO THIS SCREENING.

54
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,393
REALLY, YOU WILL ONLY SEE

55
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,195
SUCH A MONUMENTAL DISASTER

56
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:13,797
AS THIS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT

57
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:16,333
SINGLE PAIR GOVERNMENT-RUN

58
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:16,666
SYSTEM.

59
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,636
BECAUSE PATIENTS ARE

60
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:21,138
CODIFIED NUMBERS ON A

61
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:21,538
SPREADSHEET.

62
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:22,506
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

63
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:24,975
YOU DO AWAY WITH THAT

64
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:25,709
DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP.

65
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:26,810
WHICH WE ARE STILL FORNGHTD

66
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,345
TO HAVE IN THE UNITED

67
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:28,678
STATES.

68
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:29,746
>> YOU HAVE A LOFT DEMOCRATS

69
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:30,614
CALLING FOR THAT HERE IN THE

70
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:31,414
UNITED STATES.

71
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:32,415
BERNIE SANDERS IS OFTEN

72
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:33,817
TALKING ABOUT SINGLE PAIR.

73
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:35,318
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN IF WE

74
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:36,720
IMPLEMENTED THAT HERE IN THE

75
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,020
U.S.?

76
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,422
>> BERNIE SANDERS LOVES TO

77
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:42,159
USE MY FACE WHEN HE WAS

78
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,560
UNILATERAL DEBATES WITH ME

79
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,394
ABOUT SINGLE PAIR.

80
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:45,962
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIS

81
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:47,364
POSITIVE SPIN ON THIS.

82
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:48,665
THIS IS A CATASTROPHE.

83
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:50,700
AND, YES, IF WE IMPLEMENT A

84
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,669
SINGLE PAIR SYSTEM, NOW,

85
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:54,671
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

86
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,539
IT'S CALLED UNIVERSAL

87
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,873
HEALTHCARE WHERE NOT ONLY IS

88
00:01:56,873 --> 00:01:58,341
GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE OF THE

89
00:01:58,341 --> 00:01:59,409
INSURANCE, BUT EVERYONE IS

90
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:00,410
EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

91
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,244
ALL THE PHYSICIANS ARE

92
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:03,380
EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

93
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,347
THEIR SCREENING PROGRAMS ARE

94
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:05,215
ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN

95
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:06,149
WHAT WE HAVE IN THE UNITED

96
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,483
STATES.

97
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:07,884
THEY HAVE TO COST CUT AND

98
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,019
RATION SOME OF THEIR CARE.

99
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:10,554
THEY DON'T EVEN BENEFIT FROM

100
00:02:10,554 --> 00:02:11,354
BREAST CANCER SCREENING THE

101
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:12,322
WAY WE DO IN THE UNITED

102
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:12,656
STATES.

103
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,224
IF WE ARE TO GO TO ANY FORM

104
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:15,759
OF SINGLE PAIR, BY THE WAY,

105
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,993
CANADA DOES THE SAME THING.

106
00:02:16,993 --> 00:02:18,728
THEY DON'T HAVE NEARLY GREAT

107
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:19,763
ROBUST SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

108
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,198
IN THE UNITED STATES IN

109
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:22,299
TERMS OF BREAST CANCER

110
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:22,666
SCREENING.

111
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,734
IF WE GO TO A SINGLE PAIR

112
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:25,902
SYSTEM, COST ALSO NEED TO BE

113
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:26,169
CUT.

114
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,704
AND IN THAT LARGELY DOES

115
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,573
COME FROM PREVENTATIVE

116
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:30,407
MEDICINE AND SCREENINGS.

117
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:31,808
SO THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN I

118
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,378
HAVE FOR US.

119
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:35,946
ABBY: SHOULD WOMEN BE

120
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:36,746
CONCERNED HERE IN THE U.S.?

121
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:38,515
>> WHEN YOU GO TO THE POLLS

122
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:40,050
AND VOTE FOR A SINGLE PAIR

123
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,151
SYSTEM YOU ARE SAYING I WANT

124
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,586
TO BE A NUMBER ON A

125
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:42,986
SPREADSHEET.

126
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:43,920
YOU WILL BE SEPARATING

127
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,322
YOURSELF FROM THAT

128
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:46,056
DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP.

129
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,324
INSTEAD OF YOUR DOCTOR

130
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:49,192
SAYING TO YOU THESE ARE YOUR

131
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:50,594
RISK FACTORS, YOU NEED TO

132
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:51,962
START YOUR SCREENING NOW,

133
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:53,230
YOU ARE ON A SPREADSHEET AND

134
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,698
YOU WILL GET A LETTER

135
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:56,766
TELLING YOU IF AND WHEN YOU

136
00:02:56,766 --> 00:00:00,000
NEED TO DO SOMETHING.
