1
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:11,156
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT

2
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:14,860
RUSSIA ATTACKED US.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,261
>> ATTACKS ON OUR CONSTITUTION.

4
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:17,729
>> ATTACK ON THE INTEGRITY OF

5
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:18,163
OUR ELECTIONS.

6
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:19,898
>> THERE WAS ALREADY AMPLE

7
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:20,699
EVIDENCE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN ON

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,300
THE ISSUE OF COLLUSION IF YOU

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,636
ARE WILLING TO SEE IT.

10
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:26,872
>> Martha: THAT'S IN THE

11
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:27,906
DRUMBEAT FOR THE DEMOCRATS THE

12
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,574
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT NOW IS

13
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:30,242
THE 2018 MIDTERMS ARE RIGHT

14
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,411
AROUND THE CORNER PARTY LEADERS

15
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:33,779
SAY THEY WANT TO MOVE ON AND GET

16
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:36,415
TO A NEW MESSAGE FOR THEIR

17
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:36,748
VOTERS.

18
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:37,516
THEY SAY THEY CAN'T GET ANY

19
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:38,784
PRESS ON THE REAL ISSUES BECAUSE

20
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:39,484
REPORTERS ONLY WANT TO TALK

21
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:40,719
ABOUT RUSSIA.

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,456
HERE NOW MEREDITH KELLY, THE

23
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:45,257
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.

24
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:47,559
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

25
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:48,026
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

26
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:50,462
IT'S ALL YOU HEAR ABOUT.

27
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:51,096
FLIP AROUND THE CHANNELS,

28
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,264
EVERYTHING IS ALL ABOUT RUSSIA,

29
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:53,165
SO IT MAKES IT TOUGH FOR YOU

30
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:55,667
GUYS TO GET YOUR MESSAGE OUT.

31
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,570
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANKS FOR

32
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:00,038
RUSSIA IS CERTAINLY A BIG TOPIC

33
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:01,373
IN THIS INVESTIGATION IS ONE

34
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:03,442
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED

35
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:04,141
ON, BUT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES

36
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,244
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE

37
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:07,512
ACTUALLY TALKING DIRECTLY TO

38
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:08,880
VOTERS ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT

39
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,681
IMPACT THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES.

40
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:11,283
I DO THINK THEY ARE BREAKING

41
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:11,616
THROUGH.

42
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,652
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT

43
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:14,853
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE,

44
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:17,456
PROTECTING MEDICARE AND

45
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:18,690
SOCIAL SECURITY AND MORE JOBS

46
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,691
AND BETTER WAGES.

47
00:01:19,691 --> 00:01:21,293
I DO THINK ON THE DISTRICT

48
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,328
SPECIFIC LEVEL THEY ARE HAVING

49
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:23,962
THOSE LOCAL CONVERSATIONS.

50
00:01:23,962 --> 00:01:24,663
>> Martha: DO THINK A LOT OF

51
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:25,397
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT RUSSIA WHEN

52
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:26,431
YOU TALK TO FOLKS WHO ARE OUT

53
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:26,998
THERE IN THE COUNTRY?

54
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:28,900
DO THEY CARE?

55
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,469
>> IT'S NOT THE FIRST, SECOND OR

56
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:31,169
THIRD THING THAT VOTERS ARE

57
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:33,205
TELLING US IN THE HOUSE

58
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:34,539
BATTLEFIELD IN THESE SWING

59
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,273
DISTRICTS.

60
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:37,109
I THINK PEOPLE WANT THIS

61
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,078
INVESTIGATION TO GO UNIMPEDED,

62
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,114
BUT THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT THOSE

63
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:43,081
POCKETBOOK ISSUES AND THAT'S

64
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:43,815
WHAT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE

65
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:45,317
TRYING TO FOCUS ON.

66
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:46,017
>> Martha: GENERALLY WHAT WE

67
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:46,852
FIND WHEN WE GO OUT ACROSS THE

68
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:48,286
COUNTRY AS WELL.

69
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:50,322
YOU ARE LOOKING AT ARKANSAS,

70
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:51,590
KENTUCKY, A COUPLE OF TEXAS

71
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,957
DISTRICTS.

72
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:54,292
WE HAVE A MAP TO PUT UP AT WHERE

73
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:54,860
THESE DISTRICTS ARE.

74
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,994
TELL ME WHAT OTHER TRENDS, WHAT

75
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:57,295
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR AND HOW DO

76
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:59,865
YOU HOPE TO FLIP THOSE DISTRICTS

77
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:00,699
YOU HOPE TO FLIP THOSE DISTRICT

78
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:01,066
DISTRICTS?

79
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,267
>> TOMORROW NIGHT IS A GOOD

80
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:05,804
EXAMPLE OF THE HUGE NUMBER OF

81
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:07,839
VETERANS, PROSECUTORS AND

82
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:09,107
CANDIDATES, WITH RECORDS OF

83
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:10,342
SERVICE THE RUNNING ON THE

84
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:11,409
DEMOCRATIC SIDE THE CYCLE.

85
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:13,111
THAT'S CERTAINLY A TREND WHETHER

86
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:14,546
THEY OBSERVE THE COMMUNITY OR

87
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:15,714
OUR COUNTRY OR BOTH.

88
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:17,649
YOU HAVE ALSO SEEN THE STRENGTH

89
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:18,383
OF FEMALE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE

90
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:20,085
BEEN PREVIOUS PRIMARIES --

91
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,486
>> Martha: WE CAN PUT UP THE

92
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:23,855
BOARDS ON THE PEOPLE THAT SHE IS

93
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:24,456
REFERRING TO.

94
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:25,690
GO AHEAD.

95
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,692
>> I THINK THAT LAST WEEK IN

96
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:28,860
PENNSYLVANIA AND IN NEBRASKA WE

97
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,495
SAW A NUMBER OF WOMEN DOING

98
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:31,763
WELL, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH

99
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:33,331
THE ENTHUSIASM THAT WE'VE BEEN

100
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,332
SEEING FROM WOMEN IN TERMS OF

101
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:36,501
VOTING IN THE MIDTERMS.

102
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,670
I THINK YOU ARE SEEING

103
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,905
CANDIDATES THAT FOR THESE

104
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:40,272
DISTRICTS.

105
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:41,907
ARKANSAS IS DIFFERENT FROM

106
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,341
TEXAS, WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN

107
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:45,410
KENTUCKY AND THERE IS NO

108
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,678
ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL.

109
00:02:46,678 --> 00:02:47,479
>> Martha: SOUTHERN

110
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,146
CANDIDATES, IT BOTHERS THEM,

111
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:49,881
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T GET

112
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:50,515
ENOUGH ATTENTION FROM THE

113
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,150
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE

114
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,285
PARTY.

115
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,186
>> WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD THE

116
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:56,087
LARGEST BATTLEFIELD IN A DECADE.

117
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,722
WE ARE TARGETING MORE THAN 100

118
00:02:57,722 --> 00:02:58,423
DISTRICTS, SO WE ARE DOING OUR

119
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:01,293
BEST TO PROVIDE AS MUCH

120
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:02,194
ASSISTANCE TO CANDIDATES RUNNING

121
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:04,262
FOR OFFICE AS POSSIBLE.

122
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,530
OF COURSE IT'S A BIG BATTLEFIELD

123
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,364
AND CERTAINLY WE ARE GIVING THE

124
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,700
BEST SERVICE WE CAN AND I THINK

125
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,635
WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME GREAT

126
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:11,036
CANDIDATES.

127
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:14,005
>> Martha: TELL ME ABOUT THE

128
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:14,739
ARKANSAS WASTE.

129
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,475
>> CLARK TUCKER IS A CANDIDATE

130
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:18,210
THERE, A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL

131
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,477
AND HE ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE

132
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,847
RACE -- HE IS RUNNING AGAINST

133
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:22,247
FRENCH HILL.

134
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,683
HE GOT INTO THE RACE BECAUSE HE

135
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:26,685
HAD CANCER AND HE SAW HOW FRENCH

136
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:27,786
HILL VOTED TO REPEAL AFFORDABLE

137
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:30,455

I DO EXPECT HIM TO COME THROUGH

00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:34,659
THE PRIMARY TOMORROW NIGHT IN

150
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,461
FIRST PLACE AND THAT WILL BE

151
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,262
CENTRAL, HEALTH CARE WILL BE

152
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:38,029
CENTRAL TO THAT GENERAL

153
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:38,396
ELECTION.

154
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:39,064
>> Martha: SESSIONS IS ONE

155
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:44,469
THAT YOU THINK ON TAXES?

156
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,471
>> THAT THE DALLAS AREA.

157
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:47,272
SECRETARY CLINTON WON THAT

158
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:48,006
DISTRICT AFTER A LONG STRING OF

159
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:50,709
REPUBLICANS WINNING IN THE PAST.

160
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,210
COLLIN ALLRED, WHO THE NEW

161
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,879
TRIPLE C HAS PUT ON OUR RED TO

162
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,080
BLUE PROGRAM, WHICH MEANS WE

163
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,082
THINK IT'S THE MOST COMPETITIVE

164
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:57,515
CANDIDATE.

165
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:59,251
HE'S A TENNESSEE TITANS, FORMER

166
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:00,952
NFL PLAYER.

167
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:03,288
WENT ON TO BECOME A SUCCESSFUL

168
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:05,891
LAWYER AND JUST GREW UP IN THIS

169
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,125
DISTRICT AND REALLY EMBODIES THE

170
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:07,492
DISTRICT.

171
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:08,326
>> Martha: HILLARY CLINTON AS

172
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:09,494
WE SAID IT HAD A BIG EVENT.

173
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:11,229
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

174
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:13,298
SHE SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT

175
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:14,866
WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP WERE

176
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,267
JUST LISTENING TO THEIR HUSBANDS

177
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,269
AND SHE THINKS WOMEN SHOULD NOT

178
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,105
BE AFRAID TO ELECT A WOMAN AND

179
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,238
YET IN THE NEW YORK RACE SHE'S

180
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,275
NOT BACKING CYNTHIA NIXON, SHE'S

181
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:26,077
BACKING ANDREW CUOMO.

182
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:26,711
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

183
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,146
>> I CAN'T SPEAK TO HER

184
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:28,680
DECISION.

185
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,382
I JUST KNOW THAT GOVERNOR CUOMO

186
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:31,750
AND SECRETARY CLINTON GO WAY

187
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,051
BACK I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO

188
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:33,351
THAT.

189
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:35,287
