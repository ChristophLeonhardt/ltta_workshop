1
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,719
so Jeremy how important is the mobile

2
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,190
strategy at Yelp for the overall

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,260
business model it seems to go hand in

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,330
hand with the location-based service

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,609
yeah for the content that we provide

6
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,460
which is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this reputation of</font>

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,869
particular small business it's extremely

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,820
valuable when you're on the go so you

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,779
know when you're traveling when you're

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:31,859
in an unfamiliar neighborhood

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,840
neighborhood to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull up your</font>

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,670
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find great recommendations go</font>

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,739
to the perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotspot get the service</font>

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,050
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so key and so</font>

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the very beginning we've been</font>

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,350
pretty focused on mobile we had a

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,120
website or before all the smartphones

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,460
became all the rage and then we were

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,039
there at the iphone app store launch and

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,140
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot of traction with that we</font>

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,420
now have over a million unique device is

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,160
just on iphone alone that are tapping

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,500
into Yelp every single month that's not

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,270
downloads that's actual users every

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,890
month so we've seen a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of success</font>

26
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,239
there and we continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to invest heavily</font>

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,619
in that part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business what</font>

28
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,090
percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your overall traffic that</font>

29
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,970
is mobile it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still relatively small</font>

30
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,670
minority because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have tremendous</font>

31
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,470
distribution on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web so we're north</font>

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,930
of 26 million unique visitors a month so

33
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,150
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot but you know we're</font>

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,680
certainly seeing interesting numbers and

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,659
really rapid growth on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile side</font>

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,030
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the I mean how is your</font>

37
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,590
strategy evolving there what can we see

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,970
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future come to mobile free help I</font>

39
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,530
think a big part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our strategy there</font>

40
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,079
lately has been the platform expansion

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,970
so just the other day in fact we

42
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,070
launched on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android which we have been</font>

43
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting more and more demand for as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

44
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,759
platform has become more popular and

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,710
more phones have come out and so the

46
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,750
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been really great and so</font>

47
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,640
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up keep expanding the</font>

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,950
the software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have on those</font>

49
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,479
different platforms so right now it's

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty basic for instance on Android</font>

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,340
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a read-only</font>

52
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,479
application so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can read reviews but</font>

53
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,950
you can't contribute and so getting some

54
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,540
of those contribution features going is

55
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,729
a high priority for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so high priority</font>

56
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe capitalizing on the networking</font>

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,570
effects of save logging in through

58
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook or through Twitter and being</font>

59
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to upload your review that way yeah</font>

60
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,090
so we we do

61
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,360
away on the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to</font>

62
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,830
facebook to connect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter to</font>

63
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,840
publisher reviews and so bringing some

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,220
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the phone so when you add a</font>

65
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,470
photo for instance or you add a tip that

66
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,480
that gets published is also interesting

67
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,220
and so I think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll provide</font>

68
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,840
that in the future so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

69
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,940
opportunity there as far as doing

70
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,019
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> on mobile and having it</font>

71
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,459
broadcast out to all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

72
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,319
places you might want to publish great

73
00:02:35,319 --> 00:00:00,000
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thanks</font>
