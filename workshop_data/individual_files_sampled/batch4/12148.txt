on Wednesday two delightful peace-loving Palestinian Arabs dressed themselves as all through Orthodox diners and then shot up the Sirona market in Tel Aviv 13 people were shot four Israelis were murdered the two terrorists were captured Amira Hana who's a Knesset member in Israel parliament member described the scene said people were having coffee I saw a birthday cake on one of the tables and then you see the chairs upside down and glass shattered and blood all over the dead a professor at ben-gurion University a former Special Forces fighter with two kids a young mother of four kids an engaged woman who had just enough time to call her fiance before dying of her wounds this was a textbook terror attack Israel has weathered such attacks for decades but small-scale attacks on soft targets have escalated dramatically in recent years particularly by knife Israel released information about the terrorists they were both from a village near have Rome that's Hebron in Judea both were in their twenties both were celebrated by terrorists government camasta which runs the Gaza Strip and is a member of the coalition government in the so-called West Bank Hamas praised the attack their spokesman said the shooting was quote the first of many surprises plans against Israel during Ramadan so while Western governments continue to act with sensitivity regarding going after terrorists during Ramadan terrorists don't really seem to care they're just happy to kill Jews the Palestinian Authority meanwhile blamed Israel for the terrorist attack they said quote achieving peace requires everyone to stop taking any action that will increase tensions and resorting to violence Palestinians meanwhile celebrated in the streets and they handed out candies naturally the UN Security Council they did nothing because they only condemn Israel to the hate Jews this drove Israeli ambassador to the United Nations at Dani de nonne to blast the UN he said today's heinous attack sadly proves that when the international community refuses to condemn terror against Israelis the next attack is only a matter of time terror and Tel Aviv must be treated the same as terror in Paris or Istanbul but it won't be because these are Jews so both the media and Western governments treated the attack is unrelated to the broader Muslim terror war on the West here with CNN's original tweet on the attack visitor headline quote two terrorists they put terrorists and scare quotes captured after Tel Aviv attack Israeli spokesmen tweets this is obviously terrific journalism in scare quotes so terrific that CNN had to pull the tweet an issue a quasi apology they said a previous now removed tweets appeared to call into question the Tel Aviv attack as an act of terrorism it undoubtedly was well yes thanks for that 12 hours later CNN also had to issue a correction on their website there's a reason I labeled CNN Hamas is a news network on CNN during the Gaza war meanwhile the State Department condemned the quote horrific terrorist attack in Tel Aviv but continues to pressure Israel to make concessions to the terrorist government that celebrates and supports such attacks just three days ago the New York Times reported the State Department had given a grant to produce a Palestinian reality TV shows your money in which three contestants run for the job of Palestinian president by promising to boycott Israel and designating East Jerusalem the capital of Palestine when to Muslims loosely affiliated with Isis killed Americans in San Bernardino the world's or the world rightly decried Isis when Islamic terrorists murdered journalists in Paris the hashtag is yes we Sharlee trends don't hold your breath for Ani hoody or a nice rally or I am a Jew instead just keep waiting for the West to call in Israel to make concessions to the terrorists who murder women and children in cafes i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show okay so we have a lot to talk about and we have the mailbag

and get to be part of the vaunted ben shapiro show mailbag so quickly before we begin with Hillary Clinton and the horrible interview that she did last night with Bret Baier on Fox News I want to start with this this piece by Jonathan Chait of New York magazine so yesterday I let off the show by talking about the rising tribalism in American politics and so the president obama has basically relegated universal american values to a back seat he said that black people should vote for him because he's gonna stand up for the blacks and Hispanic people should vote for him because he's gonna stand up for the Hispanics and so Donald Trump responds with well I'll stand up for the white people so the white people should follow me as you end up with these this racial tribalism that's been promoted by Obama Jonathan Chait doesn't like this Jonathan Chait at New York magazine he thinks I'm being unfair to Obama he says that I am emblematic of quote the very white racial paranoia that enabled Trump to conquer the Republican Party and I gotta admit I gotta tell you folks I'm getting kind of sick of being blamed for not on Trump when I'm like the only person who doesn't like Donald Trump right I'm the person who's standing here saying the Donald Trump is a crap show and Donald Trump is a problem I've got the Wall Street Journal blaming me on one end for Donald's Ramat I got Jonathan Chait blaming me on the other end for Donald Trump it's been such a confusing year I mean honest to god I've got the KKK calling me a kook for black people and I've got the black lives matter movement calling me KKK I don't even know where I stand anymore I'm just standing here saying true things and apparently this is this is totally terrible Chait says that Obama isn't tribal so he writes this point he says it's true and then and then I love this he actually just concedes the point in the first paragraph he says it's true of course Democrats do appeal to different members of their coalition on the basis of their interests that's what I'm saying that's called tribalism so thanks for admitting my point and then he says if you believe racial discrimination against white people is as serious a problem in American life as discrimination against racial minorities as Republicans overwhelmingly do you're inclined to view any specific appeal to minorities as the odious dangling of special favors well no that's sort of misses the point I don't have to believe that racism against the white people is worse than racism against black people I just have to believe that racism against all people is wrong and therefore if you say to black people let's be racist against the white people that's bad and when you said white people let's be racist against the black people that's also bad saying that you should be able to discriminate on the basis of race because certain races are more victimized than other races I didn't say that tribalism is okay when it's when when it's justified by victimization I said tribalism is bad it's a bad thing it's a bad thing we'll get back to tribalism in a little while okay so Hillary Clinton has now started her general election campaign and that means that unfortunately for her she has to do interviews and doing interviews means occasionally chess to answer questions and answering questions means occasionally that she's going to say stupid things and by occasionally I mean that these people have no clue what they're saying I mean Hillary Clinton is she says she says terrible stupid things all the time so Hillary Clinton does this interview with Bret Baier and it just awful we're gonna go through some of it so here is Hillary Clinton he asks her about talking to the FBI and here is Hillary's response and she looks like she just wants to leap through the screen and stranglin there is absolutely no possibility of an indictment has anybody from the DOJ talked to you or your representatives I will repeat what I said that is not going to happen there is no basis for it and I'm looking forward to this being wrapped up as soon as possible has anybody from the FBI talked to you or your representatives oh I know that they've been interviewing a number of people and I've told people to cooperate and I'm looking forward to also participating I've offered to do so since last August okay she does not offered to do so since last August the Inspector General report openly says that she has refused to cooperate and so have her aides so she's just lying straight out and Brett Barrett sort of questions are on that Bret bear says well no that's not what the investigation says actually and she says don't you know what I'm sick answering these questions nothing from this investigation is gonna change anything well again I'm not responding to any of the personal attacks that come from Donald Trump he did bring up the emails though again tonight he's going to in this general election you know that can you assure the American people and the Bernie Sanders supporters who you now have to court that there isn't anything coming from this FBI investigation that's going to change the course of your campaign absolutely you're confident absolutely yes okay so she says that nothing is gonna change the face of her campaign and this is the night of her winning the nomination there's actually different interview again these are bad answers and you want to hear some more bad answers here's Hillary Clinton rambling about the economy with Bret Baier he asks her how's the economy going not that well and she answers no everything's hunky-dory 65 percent of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction so what specifically would you do differently with the economy than President Obama has done well I think that seventy six months of job creation is a good start well it's just not different I mean what specifically would you do differently than the Obama administration right but I think what what I want to establish is that we've gotten out of that deep ditch we were dropped into it took a while because it was a pretty severe recession and a lot of people haven't yet recovered to where they were before the recession that's why I said we need a big infrastructure plan I don't me understand why today's Republican Party in Congress opposes the kind of investments in infrastructure that we've been doing literally from the beginning of the Republic she's just something she's being all dgood right I mean none of this means anything she's asked she says that the economy is going great guns which everybody knows is false the unemployment rates are not what they say they are more people have dropped out of the workforce than at any time in the last 35 years and here she is trying to cobble together an economic plan that relies on building roads sorry gang it turns out building roads is not gonna fix the economy it isn't turns out the Soviet Union had plenty of roads didn't fix their economy the economy is not fixed by building roads in fact there's a good case to be made that if you want the road system new fixed you privatize a lot of the roads but Hillary Clinton has nothing to say here and so she's just rotting out the same old crap and she does the same thing when she's asked about the Clinton Foundation so she's asked about the Clinton Foundation you know did why is it that there's so much allegations why are allegations of corruption flying around the Clinton Foundation she's asked this by Anderson Cooper and here's it and again she's doing her media tour and she's looking absolutely terrible asked by Wolf Husky Anderson Cooper about about what happened to the Clinton Foundation if you're president will your husband divest himself of any association with the foundation well Anderson you know we'll cross that bridge if and when we come to it but let me just try to set the record straight we had absolutely overwhelming disclosure where there you know one or two instances that slip through the cracks yes but was the overwhelming amount of anything that anybody gave the foundation disclosed absolutely and I'm proud of the foundation I'm proud of the work that it has done I'm sure she is proud of it since it made her it paid for those really nice jackets that she's wearing these $13,000 jackets that she's wearing that she stole off of Violet Beauregarde from from Willy Wonka the Chocolate Factory so she says that don't worry it didn't sort of slip through the cracks you know stuff happened it slipped through the cracks and then she says and then she says oh by the way bill may actually stay at the foundation if I'm elected president bill will stay at the foundation this is actually a major point that nobody is paying attention to when we talk about corruption in the political process think about this Donald Trump has not said he will put his assets in a blind trust if he's president Hillary Clinton says bill is gonna continue to run the Clinton Foundation if she's president okay this is deeply corrupt stuff think about it this way Donald Trump has a bunch of business interests right and he can use the power of his office to impact his business interests this should be illegal it's not right he could use the power of his office to impact his business interests in fact he's already doing this as a candidate he's ripping judges in cases about his own assets as the presidential candidate wait until he's president Hillary's same thing as Secretary of State there is an inherent conflict of interest in the Clinton Foundation taking money from dictatorships well she was handing favors to those same dictatorships now she wants to keep doing that as president of the United States bill was running the Clinton Foundation when she was said when she was Secretary of State it was bad enough now she's saying even if I'm elected bill may stay at the foundation but some big donors clearly want the association with you or your husband that being linked to the foundation gives them as president obviously it's vital that you order certainly your husband not appear to be in any way compromised so I guess have you considered the idea of him stepping down again you know I'm not going to consider anything until we see what the circumstances are but let me just point out that people give lots of money to presidential campaigns don't they they give lots of money to political parties as well so you know that is money that goes directly to support political activities of candidates money that has been given to the foundation goes to support humanitarian work and if people want to influence anybody in office I think they would choose the political route and indeed the work of the foundation really speaks for itself okay the work from name the work of the foundation can anyone tell me what foundation does except make them rich and by the way and she says well you know people spend money on campaigns I thought it you and Bernie Sanders saying people shouldn't spend money on campaigns right it's corrupt it's deeply corrupt if corporations give money to campaigns or if they start super PACs that's terrible so she's using that as an excuse to keep running the Clinton Foundation and by the way it's less corrupt to give money to a campaign than it is to give money to the Clinton Foundation because the Clinton Foundation can pay for her expenses the Clinton Foundation can pay for her husband's house and is her husband prostitutes right the the the campaign can't pay for any that stuff presumably so Hillary is is a total crap show by the way Obama has just come out and endorsed Hillary of course and this just shows the corruption inside the Democratic Party I said yesterday Democrats are way worse than Republicans why because Republicans look at Donald Trump and half of us say oh my god this is terrible Democrats look at Hillary oye the President of the United States who is in charge of the executive branch part of which is currently investigating Hillary Clinton came out and endorsed Hillary Clinton while she's under current FBI investigation is the difference between Republicans and Democrats and this is what's so galling this is why there are a lot of people who are saying the Democrats are so terrible I have to vote for Trump no matter how bad he is just because the Democrats are so dishonest they're so terrible there's no such thing as as a decent standard when the Democrats are playing look at President Obama President Obama is is on with Jimmy Fallon on on NBC and this is a guy who says that it's terrible that we have a reality TV star running for presidents of the United States the first reality TV star President President Obama on Jimmy Fallon last night and he says yeah I'm overjoyed that Donald Trump is their nominee do you think the Republicans are happy with their choice we are but I don't know how we are we're we're very happy and the glib Glee of that right and he says he's happy with Hillary - he said that Hillary's the most qualified candidate who has ever run for presidents of the United States he said that today he said she's SuperDuper qualified if if by qualified you mean she should be in prison he said I don't think there's ever been anyone so qualified to hold this office really no one no one in the history of the country like George Washington like maybe I don't white eisenhower perhaps and that never been anyone so qualified in the history of the United States only if you're an idiot do you believe this I mean you really have to be a stupid person to believe this in any way but President Obama believes that and then he and then he kind of sneers down his nose and he says he's worried about the Republican Party to which the response of Republicans typically is go go screw yourself like I don't yeah we nominated Donald Trump you nominated a felon at least we have the good grace to be embarrassed about who we nominated some of us here's here's Obama that was too easy but but the truth is actually I am worried about the Republican Party and I know that sounds you know what it sounds like you know what it sounds like he said he's worried about the Republican Party it's just he's easy okay the idea that that Obama is worried about them he's worried about the Republican Party in the same sense that the the chiseler son-in-law is deeply worried about the father-in-law dying and leaving all the money to him okay Obama's worried about the Republican Party that may survive Obama wants to sneak in in the dead of night and stick a pillow over the Republican Party's face and just and just suffocate it out that's what Obama wants he's worried about the Republican Party and all this is going it's so galling and Republicans we look at this women go at least we're intellectually honest at least we recognize that our guy has problems you won't even recognize that you have problems that you are the problem you have no self-awareness there's not a mirror anywhere in the White House here's President President Obama last night he was slow jamming the news again again and this is a guy who argues that the that he doesn't like reality TV candidates and he's slow jamming the news with Jimmy Fallon who's a sycophant on July 1st of this year the interest rates on Stafford student loans the same loans that many of you used to help pay for college are set to double that means some hard-working students will be paying about $1,000 extra just to get their education so I've called on Congress to prevent this from happening what we've said is simple now is not the time to make school more expensive for our young people you should listen to the prison or as I like to call them the priests of the United staes things are heating up inside Congress's chambers behind all those closed doors so the president made few discrete calls across the aisle he said hey let's get together on this one without an affordable staffer loan where can a student turn the Pell Grant is a beautiful thing but with college getting more expensive is it enough by itself to satisfy all your collegiate needs no it's egregious but this what the media have done with Obama for eight years right eight years of this what are you saying about Pell loans in Stafford grant there are too many people in college anyway they're majoring in stupid crap okay that but this is the point then the media treats Obama this way and there's how they're gonna treat Hillary Clinton - and it's galling to everybody and so the reaction the natural reaction I understand it the natural reaction is Trump right Trump because Trump's just a giant pulsating middle finger as Kevin Williamson has said this is exactly this is exactly correct and you can see the anti Trump press they were holding back now I want to point something out here Donald Trump made his first comments about Mexican judges back in February did you hear anything about it at the time anything no as the media didn't want to talk about it the media wanted him to be the nominee the media ignored all the bad things about Donald Trump because they wanted to play him up they wanted to give him media attention he was a great story they didn't want to hit him with the wave and make no mistake the media do have the capacity to put together a wave I know because I've been on the other side of a wave like this so if a few years back I did a debate with with Piers Morgan on gun control and gone viral a lot of people have seen it millions of people excuse me and one of the and one of the things that happened after that is that the media decided a lot of folks in the media clearly decided that I was a little bit of a threat and so they were gonna look for an excuse to sort of take me out so a few weeks later there was a big there's a big hubbub over Charles Hager - over a chuck hagel Chuck Hagel was being nominated for Secretary of Defense by Obama Chuck Hagel is wildly anti-israel so I got a call from a source a very highly placed source in Congress that Chuck Hagel had spoken to a group called friends of Hamas okay I didn't double source the piece and so I ran it as a rumor right this was a deliberate decision we ran it as a rumor at Breitbart we said there's a rumor floating around Capitol Hill the Chuck Hagel who has not release the people who have that he spoken to that he spoke to a group called friends of Hamas we're riding around in his room er turns out that in all likelihood that rumor wasn't true I wanted to run a retraction some other folks who were above me in the editorial trend did not in any case I you know we ran the rumor as a rumor and the rumor turned out not to be true and not that big a deal happens in the media on a pretty frequent basis people report a rumor the rumor turns out not to be true and everybody moves on with their life I wake up the next morning and it is legitimately the lead on Huffington Post it's the lead on Huffington Post it's all a hoax it's all it's all fraud it's out but they ignore the fact that I reported it as a rumor and basically say in the piece it may be true may not be true it's just a rumor right they ignore all of that and they just immediately go to well must have been a hoax and I'm getting calls from MSNBC and I'm getting calls from the New York Times I'm gonna call from everybody on what is legitimately not a big story right and I say look I haven't reported all the information I had I said it was a rumor that's all I can say about it I can't verify it because I didn't verify it which is why I reported it as a rumor the reason I tell this story and by the way I wish I'd never run that story the reason that that I tell that story aside from saying everybody makes mistakes in this business the real reason I'm saying that is because there is a moment where if you've ever there's a movie with George Hamilton called the last wave and at the very end of the movie George Hamilton walks out onto a beach it looks like deep impact all of a sudden there's a wave coming at him that's a thousand feet high right he's just standing on the beach in the waves coming at him that's the end of the film the left is capable of creating the sorts of waves and they're doing this right now they're doing this right now and the wave is gonna be a pro-hillary anti-trump wave and so for all this time we've been saying aw Trump can fight back against the waves he can stand there he can rage against the sea he can stop the tide from coming in when the media decide they're on the same page they're on the same page they're on the same page that doesn't mean they can't laugh at Hillary every so often but it's not real so you know you'll have Chris Matthews every so often laughs and Hillary Clinton or as a state gonna laugh at Hillary she's terrible with God is it go already Clinton I gotta throw up my leg but still it's not the greatest throw Lester hold on Hillary Clinton what kind of a campaign you gonna run it's gonna be a campaign of matching insults you said no insults just the issues the tuitions being quote the fact that he's the Donald Trump is unqualified to be President and he's temper mentally unfit these are the issues but she's not talking is oh okay so he's he's laughing at Hillary Clinton that she's insulting Donald Trump but then he proceeds to insult Donald Trump right he says that Donald Trump is a textbook racist this is gonna be the wave that comes against Donald Trump here's Matthews again he defines racism here the United States doesn't have clean hands when it comes to racial jobs or racial attitudes or racism itself we know when you have slavery for 20 50 years that's racism it just is its domination by white people of another group okay and he's trying to link that to Trump and thank you for that definition of racism Chris Matthews yeah well when people hood slaves it back I can tell you that's racist you can argue with me I'm going to tell you that's racist you can't hold black people it's lazy that's racist you know it's racist killing black people cuz they're black that's racist so the media are coming for Donald Trump Andrea Mitchell doing the same thing she says President Obama is gonna jump in he's gonna jump in on Hillary side he's gonna make sure Hillary wins with that big win now in California Hillary Clinton has her best argument for persuading Bernie Sanders to concede exactly eight years after Clinton's painful loss to Barack Obama now President Obama is ready to go all in to make sure that Clinton can succeed him in the Oval Office and they're so excited Andrea Mitchell was so excited she couldn't be more excited Lester Holt on NBC he's also SuperDuper excited he's asking Hillary Clinton deep questions hard questions here's a hard question from Lester Holt to Hillary Clinton is this going to be the nastiest campaign ever will you respond insult to insult no absolutely not he can run a campaign of insults I'm running a campaign of issues that are going to produce results for the American people I'm going to talk about why he's unqualified to be President based on his own words and his deeds and I'm going to continue to make the case he is tempor mentally unfit to be commander-in-chief so that is funny that's the clip that that Matthews was referring to earlier she said I'm not gonna I'm not gonna hit him with insults he's unqualified and unfit but the question is really what I'm focused on there cuz she's bad at this we know she's bad at this but Lester Holt and so are you gonna be mean like Donald Trump Donald Trump's mean or even mean and terrible like Donald Trump are you evil and horrible and ugly and stupid like Donald's for you know these are the kinds of questions Hillary's gonna feel this entire election cycle you can see it happening from even the people who are supposedly Trump's friends right so Joe Scarborough we played him yesterday and Joe Scott and and I Anna made an obscene gesture at Joe Scarborough on camera yesterday Joe Scarborough yeah yesterday he said months ago it's impossible you can't you can't calls from Mussolini or Hitler don't call them any of these things God he's just Donald Trump you can't call him any of those things here is what Joe Scarborough said today today about Donald Trump when you're talking about banning over 1.4 1.5 billion people simply because the God they worship yeah that is his unamerican is anything he's ever said is unamerican is what he said about this judge and I'm with you Willie where was the outrage then like we said on this show asking the question when this first came out is this what Germany looked like in 1933 that's every bit as a fence right but why not the outrage from the right the center of the left okay and so I guess his opinion is shifted he couldn't call him Mussolini or Hitler before but now it's like 1933 and Hitler amazing how he shifted that quickly as soon as Hillary is the nominee boom right then Trump's Hitler again amazing how that works meanwhile the reaction on the right has been exactly what I thought it would be everybody is now degrading into the worst of themselves so you've got the people on the left degrading into full-on Hillary fandom we're gonna cheer her forward we're gonna we're gonna carry her forward on a platform with a chair on top like Miley innopolis with a bunch of idiot college students and on the right you've got on the right you've got people like Laura Ingraham and their response is no matter what Trump says it's just fabulous no matter what Trump says it's just the greatest thing in the world so Laura Ingraham who in this clip looks like sort of the the funhouse mirror version of Hillary Clinton is that working exactly the same top but but here is Laura Ingraham saying something very special about Donald Trump she's a talented person she's very smart but Trump has the magic sauce he just has to sprinkle it on the issues and then he has to serve it up in a very pleasing interesting and sometimes provocative and entertaining way people want to go to rallies and have a good time they want to feel there's a champion for them he began to do that last night and a much more I think organized fashion which is what was needed for some time I for one think it was a very good first step okay so you got the magic sauce which is just a horrifying image nobody wants to nobody wants to to consume Donald Trump's magic sauce that is that is horrifying in every way Laura Ingraham thank you so much for that imagery by the way that wasn't the worst imagery of the day worst imagery of the day was Joy Behar Joy Behar tweeted today that while she is sexually she literally tweeted this well I'm sexually attracted to Bernie Sanders even I want him to pull out she actually tweeted that yep joy behar providing imagery that nobody ever wanted to think about she is a joy and Wonder so what you're seeing is that on the left everybody's degrading into Hillary Phantom cheer forward the felon and on the right you see people saying everything that Trump says is fine and dandy I'm seeing people this week like now they're a bunch of people on the right you knew it was gonna happen who are saying what Trump said about the Mexican judge and that bad I mean it's not that bad right I mean come on it's not that bad I mean the left says stuff like that all the time yes the left does say stuff like that all the time and it's bad when they do it but it's turned into no no they if the left says it's not that bad I mean Trump's doing and it's not that bad the difference again between right and left is that on the right there are a bunch of people who say Trump is still unacceptable to us we don't like him and we think on principle that he's somebody we can't support Ted Cruz was asked about supporting Donald Trump and there there is one funny story about this apparently he was asked this as who's getting on an elevator and then the reporter said that Cruz just kind of turned around and looked quizzically at them as the door slowly closed in front of him which just reminds me of that that jiff from The Simpsons where Homer slowly backs into the bush away from the question in any case here's Cruz saying that he wouldn't he's not gonna support Donald Trump probably as I said before I am looking and listening and watching the candidates I'm doing the same thing millions of voters are doing and time will tell and by time will tell that means no it's a big no hey Jeff Flake congressman from Arizona he also says that Trump isn't gonna be able to win like this and he can't back Trump either yeah I can tell you we won't have any Republican in the White House that takes these kind of positions and makes these kind of statements so it's kind of a moot point whether you'll have a trump presidency because he won't be in the White House if he continues to make these kind of statements well you said something along those lines to reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday you said Donald Trump cannot win the White House with all due respect he defeated 16 other Republican candidates some of them very impressive he's won more Republican primary votes than any other Republican candidate ever why can't he win the White House there's a big difference between winning a primary and winning in general and you can take extreme positions in a primary and win a primary but try translating that into a general election win and you just can't okay so Jeff Flake says he can't get behind Trump either John Kasich is now saying he may not support Trump this is a guy who everybody assumed you know the man who looks like his face went through the washing machine a few times in your pocket John Kasich said that he can't you know you everybody assume the only reason that John Kasich was going to continue his run was because he wanted to be Trump's VP it was the only rational reason there are only two possibilities either John Kasich is fully insane out of his mind or he was running to be Trump's VP it turns out the former was likely true here's John Kasich saying that he may not support Trump at all well you support Donald impressment hard to say you know if you look at Twitter they have this thing called trending it's trending poorly yeah I mean look I I I have a completely different message you know and you know mr. Trump called me and he said you know what are you gonna do to support me I said we're like two companies you know we have a different vision a different value system and a different objective you are the host governor down for the convention that comes to Ohio in 40 days the build what are you saying it's possible you can walk into that arena in Cleveland Ohio and not endorse absolutely of course look I've been this way since I was in politics I kind of calmed the way I see him and never before never more than today does a country need to be unified its agree we don't even sound like you're on the fence no I'm giving him a chance you are I mean no Keith doesn't sound like it he's trending the wrong way with me he's trending the wrong way first of all I like that he doesn't understand how trending topics work on Twitter you can't friend poorly he's just trend right I mean either trend read um but in any case John Kasich is not on the the Trump bandwagon by the way our managing editor jeremy boring makes the suggestion that if Hillary wants to win the presidency outright all she has to do is pick Kasich for VP do a unity ticket take some of these wavering kinda soft soft Republicans away from Trump and he's finished and I think that's probably true in any case what's happened and this is a problem also for the Republicans that there are two types of people who are backing away from Trump there are people like Kasich or liberal Republicans who just don't like how from talks and then they're people like me I don't like how Trump talks and I don't like anything that Trump has to say on policy so I don't like either of those two things I don't think it's worthwhile to to put those two together but I think it is worthwhile to point out Democrats are happy to centralize around Hillary and Republicans want I know there's a desperate desire for all of us to jump on the Trump train just so that we can fight with these people I get it I totally get it I'm I have the same gut reaction that you do I look at I look at Obama just grinning it up on Fallon and I look at Hillary lying it up all over the TV news then I think god bless america I really want to find somebody who can pummel these people and the problem is Trump makes it almost impossible to do that it just makes it almost impossible to do that okay time for some things I like and then a thing I hate and then some mailbag so things I like so we're doing sports books in movies this weeks there's a great book called Emperor's in idiots by Michael Carroll I am a a White Sox fan in baseball but I'm secondarily a Red Sox fan I grew up liking both teams but White Sox much more and this book and person idiots is maybe the best baseball book ever written it's about the the rivalry between the Yankees and the Red Sox from the beginning to the end of the of the curse and it's it's terrific it's a really good fun book to read really juicy and interesting and captures the entire fight it's it's great Emperor's and idiots by Mike McAra okay we're also going to do a sports clip so the best sports clip of of the week was actually not in sport it was before a game I don't know who teaches rappers to throw baseballs but the answer has got to be nobody right cuz Snoop Dogg threw out the first pitch at a San Diego Padres game and here is what it looks like when Snoop Dogg whose son is apparently a good athlete here's what it looks like when Snoop Dogg tries to throw out a first pitch the ballgame a featured guest today is one of my personal favorites Snoop Dogg who's about the ceremonial first pitch and this is our Cricket Wireless operator in harm's way over there so first of all I like the super white guy saying that Snoop Dogg is one of his personal favorites that's that's really that's really fun but Snoop for those who can't see it he flings the ball and he misses everything I mean he misses the catcher he misses the batter's box he misses the plate he misses the stadium I mean he almost he almost knocks a plane out of the sky so that there's there's a whole compilation of the worst first pitches now and honestly one of them has to be President Obama I'm not sure who's teaching these people to throw but it's it's nobody who knows how to throw a baseball okay other things that I like in the Rio in in the world of just pop culture there's a 12 year old dance contestant who is on a show with Paula Abdul on So You Think You Can Dance and things went wildly wrong in this particular clip okay it's a little girls dancing and they all say that they want to give her a ticket to LA or whatever that says and here's where it gets dicey and she upchucks all over Paula Abdul and she's happy again she's happy again which I guess if she if she wants to be a professional dancer it's good it's good experience for being a bulimic but in any case she she vomits all over Paula Abdul and and anybody who vomit all over Paula Abdul was my new personal hero so this is so this girl is is now one of my personal heroes so good for her the Diaz he was alright but the vomiting was first-rate so well done there okay from the ridiculous to the sublime okay we're gonna start doing Bible verse of the week because I'm big into the Bible I'm a fan of the Bible as you may know so this this week Malthus was joking because I pulled a verse from numbers all right which actually is weird that it's called numbers because it's it's Bamidbar which means in the desert there that's the the the book is called by me bar in Hebrew in the desert but it's called numbers in English because the entire book is just a bunch of counting right it's it they keep counting the Jewish people over and over and over again they're counting the tribes they're counting coins and counting everything so at the very beginning it says in Hebrew it says in Hebrew so at the RushCard happenes radical Tom Nevada Bassam the me Spanish most call Carla Google Azam right it says take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel by families following their fathers houses a head counts of every male according to the number of their names and then it says that you should for everybody who's twenty years old and up anybody who's fit to go out to the army you count them by their legions you and Aaron okay so the reason that I picked this verse or these two verses is because in in Judaism in Orthodox Judaism and in Judaism because I don't recognize other forms of Judaism other than ones that believe that the Bible is true in Judaism every week we read a section of the Bible so once a year we go through the entire five books of Moses Moses so this week's portion is the beginning of numbers so there's what I'm taking this verse so the reason I picked this verse is because I think it's important to note here that God orders Aaron and in Moses that they they're supposed to count the congregation of the children of Israel by the families following their fathers houses so there are a couple of things to note about this number one the the concept of patrilineal lineage in Judaism is an interesting one because matrilineal lineage the lineage the idea that you're if you're Jewish you're Jewish for my mom is Jewish that only comes about later really it comes about the time of Ezra thousand years 1500 years after the advent of the Torah but the idea here is that your father is what defines the house in a culture now where fathers don't define our houses where fathers are considered completely irrelevant to the house where fathers are booted because women need a man like a fish needs a bicycle the reality is that we are all counted in the end by our father's house because we carry down the values of our fathers generation to generation that's point number one point number two is back to the tribalism point that I made at the very beginning of this show and yesterday's show and that is one of the most dangerous aspects of humanity is our tendency to fall into tribes right and they're counted by tribe in numbers we're talking we're counted by tribe the Jews are counted by the tribe of Judah and they're by the tribe of Benjamin and by the tribe of Don and by the tribe of Asher right they're all counted by tribe and so you might ask well why is God forwarding that why count them as members of tribes and the answer is God recognizes that we're tribal God knows us he created us God knows where tribal God knows that we have greater allegiance to our own families than we do to other people but God then says God then says that what makes you fit to be counted is not your membership in a tribe what makes you fit to be counted is your membership in in the army of Israel right what makes you fit to be counted is the fact that you are an advocate in favor of something broader so I'm very often accused by outright anti-semites very often well you say that you're against racism and you say that you're against xenophobia and you say that you're against tribalism and yet you're in favor of a Jewish state and in Jewish exceptionalism okay I don't believe in Jewish Jewish mysticism okay I don't care that Sandy Koufax is Jewish makes no difference to me the tandy Koufax is Jewish I care about the ideas of Judaism in the same way that I don't care that no I'm Chomsky is Jewish or American he doesn't represent any of my ideas I hold nothing in common with no I'm Chomsky the same is true in Judaism God is saying here God is saying here pretty explicitly that you're counted by tribe because that's how we count ourselves but what makes you fit to be counted in front of God is your membership in a philosophical system that God cares about that's what God cares about God cares about what you believe God cares about your relationship with him and the community's relationship with him he cares a lot less about the family that you belong to he's gonna recognize that you put stock in that but he's not going to count that as the ultimate membership in the congregation of Israel ultimate membership in the congregation of Israel means what are you willing to fight for and it better not just be your tribe in fact throughout throughout the the throughout the Torah there are situations where if you are if your loyalty to tribe is greater than your loyalty to to Israel you have a major problem on your hands this happens with the tribes of Ephraim in Menasha later in the Torah later in the Bible there's a point at which a Fryman Menasha don't want to cross over that they don't want to cross over the Jordan River and fight on the other side of the Jordan River and the deal that Moses makes with them and the deal with Joshua makes with them is if you join us and fight for the liberation of Israel then you can go back across the Jordan but if you're gonna just stay across the side of the Jordan we're not gonna help you at all right you're part of the broader you're part of the broader group and the broader group is united by this document that we brought down from Moses on Sinai so that's that's the Bible verse of the week okay time for if you do it okay we live from time for thing I hate to thing I hate the Democrats keep claiming over and over and over they don't want to take away your guns okay first of all there was a Ninth Circuit ruling today that says there is no personal right to concealed carry you have no right under the Second Amendment to carry around your weapon in public which is idiotic okay the right to bear arms bare as you might know means to carry that's what it means it's English they say no that's what the Ninth Circuit says and now you have this idiot this platform committee member for the DNC says no one has the right to own a gun at all this is what Democrats actually think not just keeping the guns out of the hands of mentally ill people and and criminals but I really don't personally think anyone should have a gun I mean that's just my own you know you know philosophy nothing is ever solved you know when you have a gun in your hand except the worst possible scenario nothing has ever solved when you have a gun in your hand how about like when bad guys are coming right how about that that solves you know nothing's ever solved haven't Nazism that was solved by having guns in our hands so as communism turns out so most of the world's evils so this whole thing is nothing but this is what time of Kratz actually think at least she's honest at least she says what she thinks okay time for the mailbag so again folks you have to subscribe to daily wire.com if you want to be part of the vaunted ben shapiro well back before I forget just because I know I will why don't we start with the video question this is actually about a week old but you can submit video questions via Daily wire comm also all you have to do is post your question on YouTube and then send us the link as a member and we'll grab it and we'll use it video questions so here's a video question from Kelly hi Ben one of the theories and I have comforted myself with over the course of this election cycle has been mark Stein's idea that due to Donald Trump's unpopularity with members of Congress they will be more incentivized to use assert their constitutional powers against him do you think that this is a viable theory or do you think that they will just continue to roll over and play dead for a president Trump as they have with Obama and certainly well with Hillary okay so I think they're more likely to roll over and play dead with Trump than they would with Obama or Hillary because it's harder to buck against a member of your own party than it is to to fight somebody of the opposite party the idea that Republicans haven't fought Obama is not really true they haven't fought him hard enough I don't believe but they fought him I mean the fact is that he wanted a bigger budget than they gave him he wanted to expand spending further than they allowed him to the budget the only reason for any economic growth at all has been that Republicans have stopped Obama from doing his world-beating routine the last four years the way that he did the first couple of years so I don't think that's funny but I think Republicans will play a play dead with with from because they're playing done with Trump right now he's not even the president yet they're playing dead for him they know he's the standard bearer and they have to pose they have to push for his re-election right I mean they have to they have to they have to push for his reelection that means that they can't undercut him too much I love this Donald Trump by the way just moments ago tweeted Obama just endorsed crooked Hillary he wants four more years of Obama but nobody else does and Hillary tweeted back delete your account okay this is just that I will say this it's it's a deeply entertaining election I mean this election is is deeply entertaining but it's awful and every way okay so more of the mailbag Jacob writes Ben you had an audio clip of Hugh Hewitt in new Wednesday's podcast I've never heard him speak before the only thing I heard was Vizzini from The Princess Bride does he not sound just like him I don't know that he sounds just like Vizzini from The Princess Bride but if you I would take that as a compliment I wish I sounded like Mazzini from the Princess Bride because he's the best character in the history of film the Xenia is awesome okay never start a land war in Asia Andrew writes Ben I have a girlfriend who might be a liberal I'm pretty sure she is well dude find out who goes to my college I'm a hardcore conservative who's anti-trump as well as the anti alleged woman Hillary Clinton I told her that Hillary is a pseudonym for Hades and that she should be imprisoned and then my girlfriend told me later on she doesn't agree with my politics should I dump her or try to convert her well Andrew I think that you should make a decision rather quickly before you start getting too emotionally invested so my view is that at the very beginning at the very beginning you should decide whether your values aren't compatible because values are going to outlast your desire to have sex with somebody it turns out that after you've had sex with somebody for many many years the sex is still great but you better have something in common with them because you can't fill 24 hours a day with it the way that you did at the very beginning so that being the case I would recommend that you actually think deeply about what her values are and if her values reflect your own if she is ardently pro-hillary and she's never going to change and think she thinks Hillary's the greatest thing in the world forget about it if she's somebody who's malleable and wants to and wants to talk about these things but be honest with yourself don't let the fact that she's hot blinds you to what her actual values are you know when I met my wife I could tell pretty quickly I have it I have a I pull it at our right and there's gaydar there's politicise left dar right so I can tell within 10 seconds of speaking to somebody whether they're a conservative or whether they're leftist I knew that my wife was conservative even if she didn't know she was a conservative yet cuz she was a political but I knew that she had the same social values that I did which was in favor of traditional marriage and she was in favor of religious standards of education and she was in favor of basic freedoms and she was in favor she was generally pro-life she's become significantly more pro-life since we met I knew all this right off the bat that being said you know there's always wiggle room you can if there's a different scene so let's put this way there's a difference between somebody's apathetic politically and somebody who's fully motivated to be a leftist very difficult to get the second kind of person to become somebody conservative just for you and if they do it just for you and it gonna work out well Dean Dane writes hey Ben I'm a conservative I used to like watching Hannity now I can't stand it it's turned into a daily Trump love fest he said I see principled conservatives who believe all the right stuff fall for Trump's nationalist populist movement I don't get it do you think there's any way to win them back well I think that in order to win people back where Arden Trump supporters Trump has to lose and lose badly I think that's the only way because otherwise it's for the next six months it's gonna be if you don't back my man you're disloyal if you don't back Trump you're not conservative enough there's no way to convince people on that once you're on the Trump train there is no exit from the Trump train this sucker has headed straight foot straight for Eastwood ravine that's where that's where this is going back to the future' 3style Arielle writes hey Ben I'm a 19 year old conservative I grew up in a single-parent household my mother had to take care of me and my older brother for many years while working my mother immigrated from Ecuador when she was 18 worked in a study to become a high school teacher before that she temporarily overstayed on her visa before applying for citizenship and getting it so for a time she was technically an illegal immigrant many family members point to this when I claim I'm against illegals coming across our border does this make me a hypocrite so I have to be for illegal immigration since technically if the law had been properly enforced I might never have been more than American no there are two reasons why you're not a hypocrite one is just because somebody did something wrong it doesn't mean that that thing should continue to be done wrong forever right you know my parents I'm sure when they were younger did things that I don't like but then they changed and they don't do those things anymore they don't espouse those things so you know what you can say is illegal immigration is wrong my mother probably shouldn't have done it I'm glad that she did because it worked out for me but that doesn't mean that this is a standard that America can survive also it sounds like your mom was not a welfare illegal immigrant she didn't come here for the government benefit she came here to work and I've said many times I don't have any problem with anybody coming over the border who wants to work generally so long as they're not dependent on my dollar or your dollar or taxpayer dollars I'm for open immigration so long as those people believe in basic American values and freedoms and liberties the way that you guarantee that by the way is getting rid of the welfare state as if they can only come here here's the deal when people came over in the early 20th century when my great-grandparents great-great-grandparents came over here in the early 20th century when they did that there was no welfare they came here and the basic standard was they were giving up whatever whatever niceties they had back in their homeland to come here and then to fight and scrap their way through that's a pretty rough deal that's a pretty rough deal for anybody that's what guaranteed that we the best in the brightest because you had to be ambitious enough to give up your social welfare back in the old country to come to the United States and then forge something for yourself with no help from anybody at all that actually generated a better class of immigrants we have a different magnet now that magnet is the social welfare system Vince writes if Hillary is incited drops out of the race and dumbest decide to run Joe Biden could you vote for him over Trump no I wouldn't vote for Joe Biden over Trump I think the Joe Biden is just kooky or friendly or not as robotic Hillary Clinton they believe exactly the same things William Wright's being this is sports week what is your opinion on the seemingly annual uproar over the Washington Redskins mascot I've heard you say you hate when political BS seeps into sport so I'm sure you have an opinion on this okay so my opinion on this is that everybody who cares about this is a left wing East Coast elite who likes to make himself feel good about writing about the Washington Redskins Native Americans don't give any craps about this they give less than zero craps about this the the alcoholism and poverty rate on Native American reservations is egregious it's horrible it's something that people should try and help the Redskins are like number 100 on the list as I've said before if there are a team called the the Washington Jews let's make it even worse and say they were called the Washington Jewboys so they called the Washington kikes right and then every week the kikes were beating up the Saints in football that'd be a point of pride I think it would be somewhat hilarious right so that's yeah this whole this stuff is all nonsense there's nobody who really feels no no but no Native American is being mistreated because of the name Redskins the Redskins was initially adopted as a term of affection by the team because they had so many Native American players actually Mike writes hi van I hope you and your family are well I voted for Cruz in the primary now I will be voting for Trump in the general what do you think is the best possible outcome of Trump presidency I think the best possible outcome of Trump presidency is he goes to sleep for the next four years and does nothing because I think that he's gonna do tremendous damage to our trade I think he's gonna do tremendous damage on foreign policy maybe I'm wrong maybe I maybe Donald Trump will surround himself with the best people and suddenly transform into a guy who likes to listen but somehow I doubt it Aaron writes what did you get out of law school who should go to law school I'm a recent college grad thinking about the future also you are a legend well thank you I agree when did you get out of law school so I got out of law school I got out of law school in 2007 what I got out of it was the first year does teach you to think in a more linear fashion teaches you logical thinking and logical distinctions that are useful when it comes to political thought I enjoyed Law School a lot it taught me a lot about having left things - because sophisticated left us go to Harvard Law School so I know exactly how Obama thinks who should go to law school anybody who anybody who either wants to practice law or who can get into a law school good enough that the name of the law school is useful on your resume so one of the nice things I got out of Law School is the is Harvard Law School right whenever I say that very difficult for the left to call me stupid or parochial or a backwards hick I went to their best school and I graduated with honors so it's very difficult for them to say anything about it which fits with my general theory if you have a choice between speaking up in class and getting a bad grade and keeping your mouth shut and going to Harvard Law School keep your mouth shut and go to Harvard Law School Scott writes dear Ben as a veteran I'm interested in what President Shapiro would do to increase the access to care for veterans as well as disability claims also I'm interested in your thoughts on public sector unions please pass my congratulations to mrs. Shapiro on finishing med school yeah she did that last weekend so congratulations to the wife okay so as the as the she knows she I don't even have to talk about the congratulations for her she knows how much I love her and and I bought her very expensive gifts to prove that love in any case in any case what would I do to increase access to care for veterans well number one I would open the VA to private competition I would allow veterans to access health care outside of the VA the VA care is not bad if you can get in the problem is this bottle Mike it's a real bottleneck the VA my wife has worked with VA so I know this and so I think that we should give better benefits to veterans outside the outside the VA system I don't think you should have to work inside the VA system if you don't want to work inside the VA system as far as disability claims the same sort of thing I mean look if you're if you're disabled in the line of duty I think that it's our duty to take care of you right I do think it's our duty to take care of you because you've served and that was the bargain we made with you when you decided to serve it's a volunteer army you signed a contract and we signed the contract with you and now we owe you that's how contracts work John writes Ben you always say you're running out of time on your show but it's boss whose time constraints you operate on two words Jeremy boring okay the fact is that our producers also want to smack me in the head when I go over time but I don't care about them because they are my inferiors Jeremy is it Jeremy however is Jeremy however is my co-equal as my business partner and so when he says that we have to when he says that we have to cut off the show a little bit short we cut off the show a little bit short is that by the way we are so far beyond time right now so it just shows you it just shows you when I what I care about Zach writes I love your show I'm one of the oddballs who gets depressed listening to Andrew so I have to listen to your show after to lift my spirits I guess I have a bit I guess I have to have my pessimism validated after listening to a show first don't you think it's a bit bit sexist to call it a mailbag okay second are you still going to be debating Milo I haven't heard anything about that lately so the answer is no I won't be debating Milo the reason I won't be debating Milo is because he's a coward and the reason he's a coward is because it's two weeks ago three weeks ago yeah first of all somebody I think is Dave Rubin plus the plus steven crowder they both offered to host a debate between me and my low on the alt-right and donald trump and milan went totally silent and then he blamed Breitbart news for telling him not to do it a couple weeks later he then said fine I'm willing to do it now and he emailed me an email Dave Rubin and he emailed you know all the people involved in he said let's set this up and within an hour I had my assistant email back times right and he said in within the next couple of weeks no response nothing racist I'll get back to you no response for a week for two weeks for three weeks right and then I email him again you know last week and a half ago and I said okay well you know I'm holding these dates open and I'm not gonna keep holding dates opens how are we doing this or not no response no response because he's chicken because he's because he's chicken poop because he is a coward he's a coward he's an intellectual coward it's very easy to go on campus and fight against Wrigley puff social justice warriors with an IQ of seven it's really not difficult and it's also really not difficult to lie to college students about what is good and true because they haven't studied the issues it's also not difficult to gain attention by doing silly stunts and they're fun I watch them they're fun but when you but when you do those things and you and you then spoon feed on top of it all right white nationalism and pander some of the worst people on earth and encourage college students to do the same it's really terror I don't have to reiterate my criticisms of Milo here suffice us to say he's intellectually shallow the offers off the table I don't waste my time holding dates open for my intellectual inferior x' who are too cowardly to debate me who initiate conversations then blame me for backing out of the debate that they back out of because they because they have no stones so that's my response to the Milo debate okay drew Taylor says it seems you've flirted with never Trump will won't jump on board my question is with sixty nine years of this behavior what can he do from now to November to get your vote so drew the only thing that he can do is be not Donald Trump but we'll see if he can do it we'll see if he can do that I'm sorry that I have to stop there we've gone through most of the mailbag next week go to daily wire com subscribe and you too can be part of the mailbag and we'll be happy to have you have a wonderful week and we'll be back on Monday hopefully the world will not have burned down if it does it's been nice knowing you i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
