so if you've been watching or listening to this podcast not a single thing that's happening in the political world today is surprising you at all I told you that when the health care vote failed Trump was gonna start to make common cause with the Democrats I told you no president would sign on to mass deportations and by the way I hate to say this because it makes people angry but no matter what you think you wouldn't like it if they suddenly started mass deporting people once you saw that on television it wouldn't be as much fun as you think it would be so anyway if you're surprised you weren't listening and shame on you you should be listening but really with all the stuff I told you and everybody saying I told you so and the Trump hating and trumpets making excuses for Trump and people laughing at people who like Trump the only real question is is what's going on good for the country which means is it good for freedom so we're going to be talking about that today and we've got Kurt Schlichter on to join the conversation plus we'll talk about Shapiro's trip to Berkeley and some great Confederate stuff I like but first you know men can't do a lot of things that women can do we can't bear children or talk complete nonsense and get away with it because we're cute we can't even stand with our hands on our hips rolling our eyes and tapping one foot at the same time because it just looks silly when we do it but at least we can spend a little time each month feeling out of sorts and depressed by visiting our favorite website everyday feminism everyday feminism is the site that empowers women and minorities by making them feel angry over every little thing so that they're never satisfied with anything and ultimately end up alone in their room sobbing because people are sick and tired of hearing them complain this month's best post on everyday feminism is entitled quote coming out as queer is even more complicated for a fat person unquote now that title may strike some of you is hilarious but that's only because you have a sense of humor too most of the readers of everyday feminism fat queer dumb is a deeply serious matter which of course only makes it that much more hilarious for the rest of us the post begins quote I came out as fat to myself about five years ago now let me stop right there I find this sentence fascinating the woman who wrote this post had to come out to herself as fat one day she sat down with herself in a chair or two looking herself in the face and she I hate to break this to you but I'm fat whereupon she answered herself by saying yes I've suspected you were fat for a long time but I'm glad you finally felt comfortable telling me after that she hugged herself and some tears were shed and she was able to move on it was a very touching moment dr. Karla ever an assistant professor of sociology and Women's and Gender Studies or nonsense as it's technically called explains quote people assume that since fatness is so visible there is no need for fat people to come out as fat but some people view coming out as fat as a way of taking back and reclaiming the discourse around fatness unquote I have no idea what that means but I'm sure dr. Pfeffer doesn't either otherwise she'd be doing something more useful than teaching gender studies like standing on one foot balancing a pencil on her nose but coming out as fat is apparently not so easy if you have to come out as queer at the same time the post continues quote gay fat sis men are deemed feminine because they are fat lesbian fats this women must deal with the narrative that they chose lesbianism because their fat bodies make it impossible for any man to ever be attracted to them this paragraph raises the all-important question why does it never occur to anyone at everyday feminism that with just a little bit of courage you don't have to care what people say about you so you might want to lose some weight trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show

Nancy last night Chuck and Nancy came out and said oh we've got a deal on Dhaka we're gonna increase border security in hahaha we've heard that before and then we're gonna let all the dreamers stay and no all forget the wall you know it's not that these they're not gonna there's not gonna be a wall but just that that was not part of the deal Trump immediately says no that didn't happen there's no deal he says no deal was made last night on Dhaka massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent would be subject for a vote right so he's he's talking as he's leaving to fara de to visit the flood victims and the flood scene scenes they're shouting questions on him II have to listen kind of carefully it's we've got it pumped up loud enough you should be able to hear what he says but the chopper the Presidential choppers flapping around and back there and they ask him now we're gonna play these cuts out of order here so the first one is is number 4 when he talks about whether there's a deal and what they're looking for with it so we met last night with humor Pelosi and a whole group and I think we're fairly close but we have to get massive water to GERD oh I think he's on board yeah bitches on board for Ryan's invoice we all feel agree on Daka but what we want is we want very very powerful border security okay I don't know where that 92% number comes from but he does he likes that number he's used it before 92% so somebody says what about the wall and let's remember right the wall the wall is what made him the candidate he was build the wall we're gonna build a wall Mexico is gonna pay for the wall every time anybody said something the wall got higher the wall gets got taller you know well let's let's hear what he says let's play the cut on the walls is number three no I'm sorry it's not it's number two we're doing a lot of renovation we're building gorget for example of the wall and the wall is going to be later so ok now at the same time he's tweeting does anybody really want to throw out good educated and accomplished young people who have jobs some serving in the military really they have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own brought in by parents at a young age plus we're gonna get big border security that's his tweet it's just different you know we'll play cut number six it's really different than what he was saying during the campaign this is where it went that famous moment when he was talking to chuck whatever his name is on the plane executive order gets rescinded one good thing about send you'll resend that one too one good thing to resend the dramatics I'm gonna have to daca we have to make a whole new set of standards and when people come in they have to guess what our families are gonna deport Chuck no no we're gonna keep the families together we have to keep the families together you're gonna take me out but they have to go no place to go we will work with them they have to go Chuck and either have a country or we don't have a country so we have a country we don't have a country because of if the borders are open you don't have a country so this really this really did appeal to people remember the build the wall build the wall this was his basically his the signature of his campaign and and he is now I mean the kind of surreal thing is now he is moving to do something either bush or Obama could get done which is get this dreamer act done and remember when Marco Rubio tried to do this Marco Rubio tried to make a deal with Chuck Schumer to do this stuff he was Lam basis the reason he didn't become president because Trump pulled this on him now I was telling you I don't want to say I told you so but I just want to do want to remind you that I was telling you all the time that he was not gonna do anything else but what all the other candidates would do which was maybe hopefully increased some security but then these people are not going away and nobody wants to I'm telling you I know people get angry about this but you turn on your TV and they're carrying these children out of the country and the people are crying the screaming and grandmas losing grant right you know you're not gonna want to see it and nobody's gonna stand for this it's just a political thing I'm not talking about the principle of it I get it we want to enforce the law and the the ignoring of the border law is a tremendous insult of the people of this country this is true Bushnell was true of Obama ignoring your own laws ignoring the laws for political purposes is an absolute insult to the way of life our Constitution everything everything about it but but there's a political price to pay for dragging people out over the border ain't gonna happen so here is Steve king right he's Congressman Steve King I guess from Iowa is he is one of the big fighters against you know open borders he hates this so he he is the guy when Trump is tweeting nobody does anybody really want to throw out good educated and accomplished young people let me pause here for a minute by the way the truth about the dreamers is good educated and accomplished young people that you know most of them have small jobs they do they are employed and they do have to keep you know they're bad obviously going to be bad ones among so many it's like something like 700 800 thousand people but most of these people are people trying to make their way in the world but they have small jobs you know paying like in the 1516 dollar range so those are coming away from people who were here legally those are coming away from people who are struggling poor people in America you know in Americans and people who were trying to get in and and of course they broke the law so there are people waiting to get in that then they came and took their place but here is Steve King really upset with what he heard from Trump no I don't think 92% agree on this at all I'd say about 80% of his base agree with me that we cannot reward lawbreakers if we do that then we get more lawbreakers and here's the irony out here is that in 86 Ronald Reagan led with amnesty and in about 2006 Bush 43 led with amnesty the Obama administration and the gang of eight led with amnesty in 2013 every one of those initiatives failed because the American people know we need enforcement and if you give amnesty first with the promise of enforcement second you got where Bush 41 got when he said no new taxes read my lips he got the taxes and not the spending cuts you've got to have with the important things up front and then have the honor to follow through if you're going to make the deal now family comes that doesn't come for me I've worked for 30 years to restore the respect for the rule of law especially with regard to immigration and now we were on the cusp of doing that until the Trump announcement the other day on daca and now it looks to me like things are going downhill pretty fast and we'd better put it back together I mean it's a really good point that you know that you've got to get the good things first if you're gonna get Eve Arif I I mean II verify if you ask me you verify which means that you can't get a job unless you can prove you're here legally much better than a wall much cheaper much better than a wall if you force businesses to use e-verify when they hire no jobs people go back to Mexico they self-deport you know that that is much more effective than a wall much more effective than dragging people back and forth the wall - by the way Trump doesn't have to pass a wall or pass legislation together well he's just got he's just got to squeeze the money out of Congress because there's already walls there and he says we're still building that so I don't know you know I'm just talking about the way his base feels might me personally I don't care if there's a wall or not I truly don't I do care that our laws are enforced and I don't care if our laws are made more lenient if we need those workers if we need those workers make the laws more lenient I don't care just obey the law so the guys who were in a rough place right now are guys like Sean Hannity and I like Sean a lot I mean I like him as a both as a person when I few times I've met him and I enjoy his show but he went in on Trump a hundred percent he went all-in on Trump and so one of the things he kept talent saying was that you know Trump was gonna build this wall he was gonna do what he said he was gonna do so when he heard this and remember Trump is saying there's no deal but what he's saying sounds very much what Chuck and Nancy as we now call them Chuck Canuck and Nance I guess we should go it sounds the same as what they're saying but he says we haven't closed the deal fair enough and and Sean Hannity says he tweets out I blame the Republicans they caused this they wanted him to fail and now pushed him into the arms of political suicide if what Chuck and as you're saying is true this is what Sean Hannity says now the problem with this is I agree that the Republicans let put Trump in a position where he was going to go over the Democrats but I believe the Trump is a kind whirlwind of unprincipled narcissism so I blame the Republicans for not dealing with reality I blame the Republicans for not saying oh we have this tornado coming and we ought to play pinball with them a little bit and we won't get everything we want but let's see if we can bumper-car him into doing some of the things we like but instead they did they disagree they lied there lies came to the fore we all saw that they promised to repeal and replace Obamacare didn't do it not gonna do it and so Trump now went over to the Democrats so it's true which one Hannity says the Republicans missplay this but it's not true in the way he thinks it's true that because you know that the Trump was this principled guy he was telling us he was you know I mean it's a really really different thing now now I we have to pause here for just a moment to talk about something important which is probably the biggest expense expenditure you'll ever have in your life which is your house your house is probably the biggest thing you will ever buy a lot of your savings is gone I'm going to go into it and when you go to do this and I have done this I know what this is like you go in and you go into a bank and you try and get a mortgage and the guys explain when you sign mortgage the pack of paper it's like this you could stand on it and just like you know go over the go over the top of the wall at the border especially now but you know it's so complicated that nobody ever thinks to shop for what you're doing is shopping for money you're buying money borrowing money at a price but you can actually save you know $20,000 or more right if you get banks to compete if you find out the different prices 80% of people only get one mortgage offer and if you just go to your bank it's not that you get ripped off yeah you'll get ripped off but you only get ripped off not because they're being dishonest just because you have a shopped around Lending Tree doesn't want that to happen the average Lending Tree customer can save twenty thousand dollars over the life of the loan that's average so it means half the customers could save even more whether you're looking for a new mortgage refinance home equity loan Lending Tree is the only place where you get up to five real offers from America's top lenders and you can compare them side-by-side for free and it only takes about three minutes and by the way the bank that you're going to may well be on there so it's like shopping for flights online only you're shopping for the best mortgage offers for you rates always go up or down but regardless of what's happening with the rates you can always get the right offer for you with Lending Tree dot-com are you sure you have the right deal you can find out how much you can save today at Lending Tree

apply go ahead and shop and you'll see how much you can say all right so all the different reactions at the reaction that I think was my favorite his was on Fox and Friends because Fox & Friends is like Trump's favorite show and they're trying to get out of like this and some of these people just gonna make an excuse for him no matter what they do so they I like this take is is the wall maybe the wall is just it's just a symbol listen to this as the wall almost becomes symbolic I mean I know the president ran on it it was a mantra but at the same time border crossings have gone down dramatically and you were talking about how the border the wall exists in certain forms and there's money to go to it has to come from Congress but do you think we're gonna get to the point where maybe they won't build a wall look what Donald Trump has done is proven that he has the political will to actually enforce the current law yeah that's not a you know I got to go back to campaign Trump here for a minute is cut cut number two I'm sorry cut number three my flimsy we're gonna build a wall it's gonna be a real wall it's gonna be a wall that's powerful and that people aren't gonna be going under or up or around or anything else gonna be a real wall it's not a symbolic wall we're not talking about a symbolic walls a real wall then there are the reactions from the never trumpet I have to say and some of the never Trump errs are really good people that I really like I mean they're very into that's where a lot of the intellectual conservatives are but the reactions of the never terms are to laugh at everybody who believed in Trump so I'm not in that condition because I never really took Trump seriously I you know as in terms of what he said his word never matched his actions but but they're laughing at these people but still it really was a binary choice there's no question about it and did you want this this woman in the White House who's going to be sitting there doing single nostril yoga breathing but you know you do hold and you breathe through one and you hold it and then you exhale through the other and you keep going so that would have been your president if you hadn't gotten drum so Trump is still better for me look all I care about is what's good for the country I don't think I think it is there are some real moral hazards in letting the dreamers stay I think that it makes an incentive for more people to come over I think it means it shows people that the president's word is no good I think it's really it really can be a problem in in those terms but in the terms of that like people like Ann Coulter who really feel that this is this onslaught or the people like candidate Trump who thought these you know mostly rapists and killers coming in I really don't think that's as big a problem we have handled immigration before pardon me we've handled immigration before and we can handle it now have we got Kurt all right let's bring on Kurt Schlichter to discuss this further Kurt Schlichter there he is we've got half your head right there yeah we got to move your camera up so I can see the top of your head or down or whatever yeah or just oh yeah I just lowered your chair okay Kurt is the author and senior columnist at townhall.com he is a name partner at a growing Los Angeles trial law firm a retired Army infantry colonel with a master's in strategic studies from the United States Army he's also a just a terrific writer he's got two novels we're gonna talk about and you can find him on twitter at kurt Schlichter k u RT SC h li CH ter how you doing I can't hear hold on I can't hear you Kurt Justin of course not of course no one here okay try again oh my gosh no I got your okay because everything isn't going wrong today you know let's make a deal with does Schumer because that always works out well let's drop the sanctions against Iran because I don't know let's just do it the drummer for hüsker dü died at 56 you know everything's going wrong it's I have to ask you are you a good person who coined the term Vilonia pantsuit to describe Hillary Clinton polonium on pants yes in fact I am well it's an honor it's an honor then to have you on my show that was that is Wonder I mean I keep using it and it's it's it's brilliant so so at least we're not dealing with polonium unpassed that's I lost him again yes that's right that's right so she is not president no matter how bad it gets she's not president listen to turn your sound down a little bit okay there we go all right all right better let's see is that better yes it is a little bit so you have been you have been a kind of a supporter of Donald Trump in the sense that you don't jump on him no matter what he does you don't you haven't listened to the never Trump errs on the right on a day like this on a day like this when Trump seems to have spun a little bit out of control to come back to his Democrat instincts yeah how are you feeling what what does this make you think is gonna happen well let's put it this way at about 6:30 a.m. I wrote up a thousand word column for Town Hall which is now up called read my lips Schumer's playing you for a fool so I was a cruise guy until he became the nominee and it was either him or her I'm a military guy you you play with the pieces you're given you you come with the army you have he was the army we have I have felt my attacks on him during the primary season were brutal and accurate and I don't withdraw any I thought that my best role was over the last year or so since he got the nomination and eventually elected uh was not pick apart the things he's doing wrong and there were plenty of them there are plenty of other people doing that mine was to point out the things that he was doing right to help keep the bases morale up to point out why you know the sky isn't necessarily falling and even today this guy's not all right okay Hillary is not our president no matter what happens and of course you and I are both personally to blame along with the rest of the universe for that everything but her so you know but sometimes you just have to say wait a minute and I'm not I'm not mad that he's quote-unquote betraying me because I always knew he was a 70 percent guy right Reagan 90% Cruz 95 percent even likes the kind of sexy librarian you know oh but you know I knew it from 70% of time let's go a cool blog the climate scam fraud that's good but then he was gonna do something else like wow you know Ivanka really wants family leave and I'm not gonna like that but you know what the majority of Americans don't agree with me yeah yeah so I'm gonna take what I can you know I agree you know what is kind of surreal is that this is this is the way before Barack Obama Washington used to work you know people who lied and they went in and they made deals and they compromised and then and people follow their personalities it's amazing that a an offbeat president like Trump and really outlandish president like Trump he's actually bringing us back to normalcy after the Obama years I mean we've been sold this idea that Obama Obama was a terrible president and and he was an ideologue and now suddenly things are moving and things are flowing a little bit look I think guys like you and me you follow this stuff and are emotionally invested I get angry when he doesn't do Sloan that's super conservative sure cuz I forbid it but you know I've been listening I listened to some talk radio listen to some normal people and there are some people out there going well you know I'm very conservative guy but I like he's getting some done yeah and there are people out there who don't have my agenda and one of the things I've learned in the last two three years is a lot of Americans don't have my exact agenda and I think a lot of people and conservative incorporated of which I am a member uh forgot that normal people have a little bit different interests than we do yeah and you know you know presence free trade I love free trade but was I thinking about the guy at the carrier plant who's 58 years old and suddenly gets full your jobs going to Juarez you have a kid in college you got a mortgage maybe you should take up coding for $8 an hour if you can find a job because Milton Friedman says something yeah well that's that's exactly right and you know conservatives in fact people who love freedom who put freedom first are always in the minority we always have to find friends who have other you know who have other interests to join with us and we always have to make compromises and actually there's so many on the right who do not understand that simple fact that we are the minority being a conservative is like being a fan of a really good band that hasn't signed yet nobody else knows about yep yeah and it's like well you know you got your Nickelback but I'm you know I'm listening to you know I'm listening to you know the electric prunes to the quickening it's just so wait when do you look at the never Trump errs now I mean you you have been really hard on them you have really kicked them around the block and it's been hilarious by the way hard on a class of never trumpet I know a guy who opposes Trump but ben shapiro is the ultimate he opposed the throne what do you thinks Trump is wrong right he supports Trump what he thinks Trump is right and he's rigorously fair about it that is what he does now I don't pretend to be rigorously fair I avoid criticizing him intentionally because I think other people are filling that role and I'll tell you that you never Cruz oh he's trouble it's not never but mostly I don't because that's not I'm not a critic I'm an advocate mm-hmm I'm a trial lawyer in real life and I do dress like this and you know I I want my side to win and I think I just serve it by advocate now a lot of nevertrump first though I think are mad because Trump and his movement which is really bringing in to the Republican Party which was very concerned with being on the right they're bringing in now an anti-establishment axis so we really it's an uncomfortable coalition between people who are primarily right-wing and people are primarily any establishment and they're upset that their cynic yers are being upset you know right now maybe you know we're not maybe selling as many cruises as we used to now people aren't listening to me or reading me as much and I think I think there's some insecurity out there that's driving some of this there are a lot of guys who would like to go back to the Obama years cuz they were perfectly happy in the minority kinda in the minority though we had capital it really didn't matter much I think there's a light one of the things I've noticed is there's a lot more personality going on than you would have thought you know the Conservatives is not a rigorous debate of ideas it's human beings in a giant I school and some of us are on the debate team and some of us are jocks and some of us are never gonna make it out with a cheerleader yeah I've come to terms with that Kirk Dan stuff tell me about your novels you have written novels that you have been publishing you published your yourself but they've done tremendously well Ted what was the last one called the last was called Indian country the first was a traditional one you were one of the guys I talked to right and you were away guys he said what he got he a traditional you got to just do it and Mike Mike Walsh was an ER guy when I was talking to people like you who established doing it so I did it in conservative insurgencies at one quote real book and I got a real publishing contract which is really crummy huh like most publishing contracts and I decided to use I had done some previous things on Amazon I decided to use the new technology and do novels and I could do a my way on my time frame well it's my royalty rate and I can put them out fast you know how long it takes I know skies I could finish a novel have it proof read copy edited and have it up in a matter of days three days and then it's selling and I'm getting the check two months later it's beautiful beautiful thing what tell tell me quickly I got it I'm gonna have to go but tell me quickly what the book is about both books People's Republic in Indian country our adventure novels you got an operative in a world where the United States has split into red and blue states and he goes into the blue states and has various adventures and there's lots of there's lots of humor there's lots of shooting all the

that cut of you got to see this kind of Ted Cruz so all the stuff there's a Democratic senator on trial Menendez on trial for corruption nobody's talking about that there's a Democratic mayor of Seattle has to step down because he's been accused like five times of molesting children gay guy right and he's been he's stepped down they were they covered that but they don't mention he's Democrat they just don't use the word Democrat they do the same thing the Menendez draw but some staffer on Ted Cruz's Twitter feed liked a porn movie and that's the question on CNN I want you watch this I used to Allison Cammarata Ted Cruz calls her a knucklehead to her face on CNN and she doesn't even hear it listen to us is subtly he does this it's great you appreciate the irony that you once defended a Texas law banning sales of sex toys no actually actually I do that that's a good example Dan of act where the media runs with things that are just totally false what's what's false about that so what is false about that so I've read on online you know Cruz supports banning sex toys no no that's completely honest I just I reread the brief this morning so the sale of it all right I spent five and a half years as the Solicitor General in Texas I worked for the Attorney General the Attorney General's law job is to defend the laws passed by the Texas letters it one of those laws was a law restricting the sale of sex toys it was a stupid law listen I am one of the most libertarian members of the Senate I think it's idiotic but it's an opportunity for knuckleheads in the media to claim oh isn't this ironic that Cruz wants to ban these to be able to do we can't believe I'm gonna ask you this but so you're officially saying Ted Cruz is okay with people buying sex toys I am saying that consenting adults should be able to do whatever they want in their bedroom so so they said the headline was Ted Cruz's you know is okay with sex toys but actually it's Dana Bash Allisyn cammarata they all look alike to me back because she says to him isn't it ironic that you back this and he said no it gives a chance for knuckleheads and media to call and she's still looking at him like you know wait did I just get called a knuckle and I'm not sure yes you did anyway Ted Cruz absolutely handling that brilliantly so let's talk about ben ben shapiro is going to berkeley and there has been he's now been he's now become the news you know he has become the news because i'm reading about him in the new york times and reading about him in the Wall Street Journal those in editorial today and every time I see the story covered it says Berkeley braces for ben shapiro berkeley braces for the arrival of ben shapiro and i keep thinking you know we here at the daily white ben arrives at the daily wire every day we never brace for him why cuz he's a perfectly pleasant decent you who comes in and does his work and chats with everybody amiable him and it goes home like the rest of us do there's no reason to brace for ben shapiro and that's not what they're bracing for they're bracing for you leftist thugs who create violence when people try to exercise their right to free speech that's what they're bracing for and it's just an incredible example of the leftist tendency of media even on fox news because they're all in the same kind of bubble together II no matter what their their opinions are they're all in the same kind of bubble where they're saying oh they're bracing for ben shapiro they're not raising for ben shapiro they're bracing for an Tifa yesterday i tweeted that you know they're not then never heard anybody they're not bracing for him and people were actually tweeting back at me you can't say ben never hurt anybody he hurt people's feelings and that's important no it's not it's not important that you're hurt people's feelings it's important if you hurt your wife's feelings it's important if you hurt your children's with your friends feelings but when you're a thinker and a speaker people are coming to you to seek for truth you may not be right you're just seeking for truth everyone who speaks and seeks for truth is going to hurt someone's feelings martin luther king hurt people's feelings you know everybody who seeks the truth is gonna hurt people's feelings that's that's what free speech is about you don't have to go to these things you don't have to go and you know the New York Times Barry Weiss in the New York Times is a former newspaper you may have heard of it you know she writes this thing where she says she supports Shapiro she says the brouhaha over Ben Shapiro is significant not because of what might go down Thursday at Berkeley but because it is a perfect exhibition of a much broader phenomenon increasingly apparent in the wake of Charlottesville the sloppy conflation between actual white supremacist and well-run of and run-of-the-mill conservatives libertarians and classical liberals whose main beef is with some on the Left who seem like they'd rather do without the First Amendment and and that first of all is not sloppy the New York Times does it on purpose most of the mainstream media does it on purpose they link us together we have to answer the question any conservative especially a senator has to answer the question do you support you know the the neo-nazis but none of the Senators and none of the congressmen on the Left have to answer whether they support an Tifa who are fascists they call themselves anti-fascist but so what I call myself a ghazal that doesn't make me a Cazale they're fascists you know and I just think that this is you know this is an example I I disagreed with the New York Times because it's not about the fact that Ben is a decent guy putting forward a perfectly reasonable opinion even if he weren't even if he weren't he'd have the right to free speech your feelings don't matter he is the right to free speech this is how we find the truth by listening to one another or refusing to listen to one another and staying home this is how mankind moves forward the only way we've tried everything else this is the way that works hi favorite reaction to this has come from the onion which says Kali is an article in the onion college encourages lively exchange of idea say from Boston saying that such a dialogue was essential to the college's academic mission tres Scott University Preston and Kevin Abrams confirmed Monday that the school encourages a lively exchange of one idea as an institution of higher learning we recognize that it's inevitable that certain contentious topics will come up from time to time and when they do we want to create an atmosphere where both students and faculty feel comfortable voicing a single homogeneous opinion and said Abrams adding that no matter the subject anyone on campus is always welcome to add their support to the accepted consensus quote whether it's a discussion of a national political issue or concern here on campus an open forum in which one argument is uniformly reinforced is crucial for maintaining the exceptional learning environment we have cultivated here lively exchange of idea alright let us have things I stuff I like stuff I like as we head into the Cleveland this weekend you know we had Victor Davis Hanson on last week and I was talking to him about taking down Confederate statues and he was you know he's a historian he was talking about you know the fact that these things are not just they don't just represent what the person who was memorialized represents but they represent history and you can be an adult and discuss history and understand that you might represent some someone's you might be representing a moment in history without agreeing with the thing that that person stood for but you know and the only mentioned while he was talking he mentioned Joan Baez's recording famous left-wing protest singer country folk singer he mentioned her recording the night they drove Old Dixie down which is about a working-class guy in the south lamenting remembering the day that Dixie fell and how his brother died and he's a you know a working man his name is Virgil Kane and she basically plays out that thought and this is largely considered one of the great rock songs or folk songs of all time it constantly makes those lists you know of like the top 20 or top 100 songs it was absolutely iconic and it's time even if people have forgotten it and the thing is it is part of a tradition that the West that has been with the West from the very beginning when you go back to the earliest let's take the Iliad the Iliad you know is written by a Greek but the Trojans it's about the Greek Trojan War but the Trojans come across as noble people Hector is really the most heroic person in the Iliad the Persians right they beat the Greeks birth beat the Persians and then Aeschylus wrote the Persians where he looked at things from the Persians point of view the Trojan women by Euripides the same thing in the Middle Ages they had the Song of Roland which had the Muslim hero Saladin it was about the Crusades roll into went on it was a crusader went off in the Crusades but he talked about Saladin the great Muslim hero on the other side he's rep and as a noble person at the end of the Civil War Abraham Lincoln exemplified that tradition by welcoming the South back without wanting to impose on them terrible fines without really wanting to crush them basically if you come back you're back and many of the people who fought on the Confederate side were buried in federal graves so they were celebrated as American soldiers and that is part of the tradition of the West so these clowns who are going around attacking the Confederacy pulling down Confederate statues and of course already moving on to Thomas Jefferson and the rest these people are violating the one of the most important principles of the West the principles of preserving history of understanding the other guy's point of view I mean that is essentially what the West is about is understanding the other guy's point of view even as you fight for and stand for your principles you know there was a movie called Gods and Generals came out in 2003 I think they I can't remember if they put it on TV first and then released it but it had Robert Duvall playing robert e lee and there's this wonderful speech where he looks out at the potomac and somebody says oh that's where George Washington crossed the Potomac and he's in and General Lee says never mind that that's where I met my wife and he starts to talk about what the land means because Robert Ely was offered the generalship of the Union troops and he turned it down because he was loyal to his land and this is this great speech robert duvall as robert e lee talking about what the Yankees can't understand about the south something these Yankee do not understand will never understand you see these rivers and valleys and streams fields even towns they're just markings on a map to those people in the wharfs and Washington to us my goodness they're earth places and burial grounds they're battlefields where our ancestors fought places where you and I we learn to walk to talk to pray places where we made friendships and oh yes fell in love and the incarnation of all our memories mr. Taylor and all that we are see that kind of loyalty to the land is something we remember about people and something that makes people noble and we understand we even understand this of some of the Germans who fought for the most horrible philosophy ever we understand that some of them fought for their country because they didn't catch on that maybe their country had left them we don't we know that not all of the people who fought and died on the side of the Germans were Nazis you know that this is something that we understand about the past and why we honor people even though they stood for something that we now find reprehensible and unacceptable that is the whole point of the West is to understand because when you understand things you can build you can go forward and that's the same thing of listening to people you disagree with you know when you understand the guy you disagree with you can start to see what's what is what you're trying to move toward even making the argument even making the argument makes you a better person a more thoughtful person alright the clayvin last weekend is coming on at least there doesn't seem to be a hurricane on the way but I hope it is not a Clavin this weekend for Shapiro and Berkeley I hope he comes back even though I would seize the title of biggest podcast on The Daily wire if he doesn't but no I really hope but he does I hope you all stay safe I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show survivors of the clave this weekend will gather here again on Monday and like my brother before me I took a rebel stand or he was just 18 proud and brave but a Yankee laid him in his grave I swear by the blood below my feet you can't raise it came back up when it's in defeat they drove Old Dixie down and all the bells were ringing the night they drove Old Dixie down and all the people were singing they went nine
