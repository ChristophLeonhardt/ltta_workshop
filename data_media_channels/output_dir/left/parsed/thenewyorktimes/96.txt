Bats are
amazing fliers,
and their flexible
wings are a source
of endless fascination to
scientists who study flight.
For instance, what about
those long, thin muscles
in bat wings that aren’t
attached to any bones?
It seemed that those muscles
might help shape the wings
in flight, and now
researchers have
evidence that that’s true.
But it wasn’t easy to get.
Brown University scientists
used ultrathin electrodes
to record muscle
activity while the bats
were flying in a wind tunnel.
They also shot high-speed
video at the same time.
Sure enough, the
muscles contract
on the downstroke, and that
could make the wings
stretch less, which would
help the bat fly.
That could be good to
know if you’re making
soft-winged flying robots.
But really, the
reason to study bats
is that nothing else on
Earth flies the way they do,
and they fly very, very well.
