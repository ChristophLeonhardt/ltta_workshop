00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:08,687
[♪♪♪]

2
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:11,190
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN

3
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:18,530
BUT THIS WEEK HE CAUSED A MEDIA

4
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:26,205
EXPLOSION BY RATCHETING UP THE

5
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:28,107
MEDIA ON JEFF SESSIONS.

6
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:29,308
HE SAID THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

7
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,176
SHOULD STOP THE WITCH HUNT RIGHT

8
00:00:31,177 --> 00:00:33,579
NOW BEFORE IT CONTINUES TO STAIN

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,116
OUR COUNTRY ANY FURTHER.

10
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:38,884
JOINING US.

11
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:47,292
A "WASHINGTON EXAMINER"

12
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:49,228
CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER

13
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,197
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR IN OHIO.

14
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:53,932
HE'S SUGGESTING HIS ATTORNEY

15
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,968
GENERAL BLOW OFF THE FACT THAT

16
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:58,537
HE RECUSED HIMSELF FOR ETHICAL

17
00:00:58,538 --> 00:00:59,104
REASONS.

18
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:03,142
IS THE MEDIA STORM AROUND THIS

19
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:03,509
JUSTIFIED?

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,244
MOLLIE: IT'S GOOD TO TALK ABOUT

21
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:05,944
THIS.

22
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:07,913
BUT WE NEED MEDIA PEOPLE WHO

23
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:09,782
UNDERSTAND HOW DONALD TRUMP

24
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:10,115
SPEAKS.

25
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:11,784
AFTER TWO YEARS OF SEEING HIM

26
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:14,386
SPEAK IN PUBLIC AND SEEING HIS

27
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,927
HE'S EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION WITH

28
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:24,997
A PROBE THAT SIDELINED HIS

29
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,700
ADMINISTRATION FOR A YEAR AND A

30
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:28,901
HALF.

31
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,136
EVERYONE ELSE NOT JUST BEING

32
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:33,105
POLITICIANS, BUT PEOPLE IN THE

33
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:35,607
MEDIA ARE NOT HOLDING MUELLER

34
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:36,508
ACCOUNTABLE.

35
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,243
THEY THINK THEIR JOB IS TO

36
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:39,812
CHEERLEAD INSTEAD OF ASK

37
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:40,279
QUESTIONS.

38
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:49,722
WHY HASN'T HE FOUND COLLUSION

39
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:51,690
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH

40
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,592
WAYS WE WERE PROMISED BY THE

41
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:53,926
MEDIA.

42
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:56,562
WE ARE NOT SEEING GOOD

43
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:57,696
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PRESIDENT

44
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,131
TRUMP SPEAKS.

45
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:02,935
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT COMPLAINING

46
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:05,137
ABOUT THE WITCH HUNT AND THE

47
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,513
OF COVERAGE OF THE STORY HE

48
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:14,813
HATES?

49
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:22,221
GILLIAN: THERE IS AN OLD ADAGE

50
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,623
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES BAD

51
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,725
COVERAGE IS BETTER TO NO

52
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:30,429
THAT RULE.

53
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,699
HOWIE: HE KEEPS COMING BACK TO

54
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:41,440
IS DOING A GREAT JOB AT LARGE,

55
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:42,641
POINTING OUT TO THE PRESIDENT,

56
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,977
WHY DO YOU EVER TWEET ABOUT

57
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:46,612
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE ECONOMY.

58
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,448
WHY DO YOU TWEET ABOUT ANYTHING

59
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:52,751
OTHER THAN 4.1% GDP.

60
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:56,789
IT SEEMS YOU ARE DERAILING YOUR

61
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,423
AGENDA, YOU ARE ALREADY THE MOST

62
00:02:58,424 --> 00:02:59,958
OF WIDELY COVERED PRESIDENT IN

63
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,403
WITH RUSSIA TO STEAL AN

64
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:11,937
ELECTION.

65
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,773
I THINK HE LIKES REMINDING

66
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:21,580
PEOPLE OF THAT.

67
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:23,816
GILLIAN: HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO

68
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,118
HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION BE

69
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,952
SIDELINED?

70
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:30,989
HE'S ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS.

71
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,860
CAPRI: IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY

72
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:35,928
SHOULDN'T CONTINUE TO DO THE

73
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,729
WORK THEY ARE DOING.

74
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,432
HOWIE: I INTERVIEWED RUDY

75
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:50,342
I ASKED HIM, I SAID HE -- I SAID

76
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:51,343
HE NAMED SESSIONS.

77
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,645
AND HE SAID HE WAS TALKING ABOUT

78
00:03:53,646 --> 00:04:01,753
A GENERIC ATTORNEY GENERAL.

79
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:04,489
CAPRI: I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A

80
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,491
LOT OF SCRUTINY ON THIS.

81
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:08,493
ON ONE HAND THERE ARE SOME IN

82
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:11,163
THE MEDIA THAT UNDERSTAND SORT

83
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:14,433
OF THE NUANCES OF DONALD TRUMP.

84
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:16,668
HE GETS FRUSTRATED.

85
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:18,970
HE SEES SOMETHING, HE TAKES TO

86
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,538
TWITTER AND REACTS.

87
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,975
BUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF

88
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:23,609
THIS.

89
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,345
BECAUSE THERE IS ALL THE

90
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,446
DISCUSSION SOUNDING OBSTRUCTION

91
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,514
OF JUSTICE AND HE IS THE

92
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:30,515
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

93
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:34,419
AS WE SAW IN THAT CLIP FROM CNN.

94
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,955
WHAT HE SAYS AND WHEN HE USES

95
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:38,957
HIS WORDS, THEY MATTER.

96
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,227
HOWIE: WE CAN ALL AGREE HE'S NOT

97
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,839
AND TAX EVASION AND PRETTY MUCH

98
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,475
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DONALD

99
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:59,177
TRUMP OR THE CAMPAIGN.

100
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:01,246
MOLLIE: EVERYONE IS INTERESTED

101
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:05,484
IN THIS TRIAL AS PART OF THE

102
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,818
COLLUSION THEORY WITH RUSSIA.

103
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,554
BUT THE PROSECUTORS SAY THEY ARE

104
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:17,496
NOT BRINGING UP COLLUSION.

105
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:20,766
WE ARE NOT SEEING ANYONE

106
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,434
ACTUALLY ASKING THE DIFFICULT

107
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:23,669
QUESTIONS WITH THE MUELLER

108
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,202
PROBE.

109
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:26,872
THEY SEEM TO TRUST IT

110
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:27,272
IMPLICITLY.

111
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,708
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT TAKES TO

112
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:32,244
TWITTER AND HE SAYS, WHO WAS

113
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:39,484
TREATED WORSE, AL CAPONE OR PAUL

114
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:40,819
MANAFORT AND DRIVING ATTENTION

115
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,587
TO A TRIAL THAT WAS ALREADY

116
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:45,457
BEING COVERED, BUT MAYBE NOT

117
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,460
BEING COVERED CONSTANTLY.

118
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:51,396
ILL  * THAT WAS AN INSTANT TRUMP

119
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:52,631
TWEET.

120
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,835
SLIDING SCALE, EVERYTHING IS

121
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:01,139
COMPARATIVE -- EVES

122
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,374
COMPARATIVE -- EVERYTHING IS

123
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,275
SUBJECTIVE.

124
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:05,978
THE FIRST THING HE DID WHEN

125
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,313
MANAFORT WAS INDICTED.

126
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:12,417
HE SAID WELL, WHAT WALL MAN FOR

127
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:22,160
NOT NEARLY AS BAD PASS WHAT WAS

128
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,895
DONE BY HILLARY CLINTON.

129
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:27,265
CAPRI: SHOULD YOU NOT BE ASKING

130
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:29,134
QUESTIONS OF HILLARY CLINTON WHO

131
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:33,405
HAD A SPY GET SOURCING FROM THE

132
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:40,545
KREMLIN TO GET SOURCES INTO THE

133
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:40,912
ELECTION?

134
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,382
CAPRI: THE MANAFORT TRIAL

135
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,887
ONE OF THE THINGS TRUMP PUT IN

136
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:50,489
HIS TWEETS.

137
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,324
BASICALLY EVERYTHING IN THIS

138
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:56,228
TRIAL PREDATES MANAFORT'S

139
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:57,662
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CAMPAIGN.

140
00:06:57,663 --> 00:06:59,765
I THINK HE'S TRYING TO GET THAT

141
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,740
ON TO THIS MANAFORT TRIAL.

142
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:11,810
BREAKING COUNT AL CAPONE TWEET.

143
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:17,249
YOU SEE "SAYS INQUIRY" TALKING

144
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,683
ABOUT IT.

145
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:23,522
HOWIE: THIS RALLY WENT ON IN

146
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:24,756
OHIO.

147
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:26,525
PRESIDENT TRUMP: MSNBC IS SO

148
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:27,859
CORRUPT.

149
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,394
IT'S SO DISGUSTING.

150
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,262
SO DISGUSTING.

151
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,831
THE GUYS THAT WE LOVE, RIGHT?

152
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:34,966
THEY ARE BLOWING THEM AWAY IN

153
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:38,503
THE RACE.

154
00:07:38,504 --> 00:07:41,173
HANNITY, LAURA INGRAHAM, TUCKER

155
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:41,506
CARLSON.

156
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:46,378
STEVE DOOCY.

157
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:54,219
I AM NOT SURE IT HELPS FOX WHEN

158
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,721
HE BRINGS IN THE OPINION HOSTS

159
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:57,189
LIKE THAT.

160
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,193
IT SUGGESTS THE ENTIRE NETWORK

161
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,232
NARRATIVE THAT THERE IS A

162
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,767
PREFERRED NETWORK THAT MAY HAVE

163
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,103
A SPECIFIC BIAS AND EVERYONE

164
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:19,277
4,000 VIEWERS INTERESTINGLY

165
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:21,179
ENOUGH SHOW FOX NEWS AS NUMBER

166
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,782
TWO AS THE MOST OF TRUSTED NEWS

167
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,952
BY MOST OF AMERICAN VIEWERS THAT

168
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:28,253
WERE SURVEYED.

169
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:37,696
NUMBER 1 WAS [INAUDIBLE]

170
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:40,132
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT USED THE

171
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,567
WORD DISGUSTING AT THE

172
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,335
PENNSYLVANIA RALLY.

173
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,937
THIS MORNING HE TWEETED THEY

174
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:48,573
PURPOSELY CAUSED DISTRUST ANSWER

175
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:50,175
THEY ALSO CAUSE WAR.

176
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,218
STRAIGHT.

177
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:04,389
WHEN YOU BEHAVE IN SUCH A

178
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,724
CLOWNISH FASHION WHERE THEY ARE

179
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:12,497
OPEN ABOUT HOW THEY VIEW THEIR

180
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,332
JOB AS RESISTING HIM.

181
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:18,603
PEOPLE.

182
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:23,208
A RECENT POLL SHOWS 72% OF

183
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:31,183
AND MISLEADING INFORMATION.

184
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,817
THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE UNTIL

185
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:35,387
SUCH TIME AS THE MEDIA TAKE

186
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:37,989
THEIR JOBS MORE SERIOUSLY AND

187
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,958
START COVERING HIM STRAIGHT.

188
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:54,306
THOUGH I DO NOT LIKE THE

189
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:57,142
INACCURATE MEDIA ABOUT ME, BUT I

190
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,212
