1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,649
A
PENNSYLVANIA PASTOR WAS CAUGHT

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:06,330
IN HIS VEHICLE IN A WELL LIT
NEIGHBORHOOD.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,330
HE WAS IN THE

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,559
BACKSEAT AND IN THE FRONT SEAT
WAS A MAN WHO WAS NAKED AND

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,200
TIED BY NYLON ROPE.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,430
I WAS THAT YOU WERE GOING TO
SAY NAKED AND AFRAID.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,010
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE WAS
AFRAID.

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,860
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS A

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,890
CONSENSUAL SITUATION.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,880
BUT
NONETHELESS, PASTOR GEORGE

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,320
NELSON GREGORY MADE A BAD
DECISION WHEN HE PARKED HIS

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,079
NEIGHBORHOOD IN A WELL LIT
NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE IT WAS EASY

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,680
FOR PEOPLE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD
TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
ONE

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,010
RESIDENT ACTUALLY CALLED THE
COPS BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNED

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,899
THAT HIS DAUGHTER COULD SEE THE
NAKED MAN FROM HER BEDROOM

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:43,899
WINDOW.

18
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,040
WHEN THE COPS SHOWED
UP, THEY FOUND THE SITUATION

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,490
AGAIN THE PASTOR WAS IN THE
BACKSEAT NAKED, TIED UP MAN WAS

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,789
IN THE FRONT SEAT AND THE STORY
SEEM TO CHANGE BASED ON

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:54,910
GREGORY'S ACCOUNT.

22
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:05,140
LET ME GIVE
THE DETAILS.

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,109
BLESS YOUR HEART.

24
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,920
HE ALSO
SAID:

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,799
LATER HE KIND OF SWITCHED UP HIS
STORY.

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,270
HE SAID COPS TOTALLY

27
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,270
MADE THAT UP.

28
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,270
HE NEVER MADE
THOSE STATEMENTS.

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,270
IN FACT,

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:37,149
HERE'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

31
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,960
HE
SAID:

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,499
OKAY, BOOK.

33
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:47,880
IF HE HAD LEFT AS
THE FIRST STATEMENT, I DID

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,149
NOTHING WRONG AND IT WAS
CONSENSUAL BY THE WAY, THE NAKED

35
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,329
MAN SAYS IT WAS CONSENSUAL.

36
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,619
WE
ARE DONE WITH IT, DO WHATEVER

37
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:54,899
YOU WANT.

38
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,099
BUT HE BRINGS HIS
WIFE INTO IT.

39
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,099
HE SAYS MY WIFE

40
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:59,200
AND I HAVE BEEN COUNSELING THIS
GUY, THE TRUCK THING.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
WHAT IS

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,619
THE DRUG THING HAVE TO DO WITH A
NYLON ROPE?

43
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:03,889
AND HE SAYS THERE

44
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:04,889
WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.

45
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:05,919
THERE
WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO AS HE

46
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:09,369
TOOK HIS SHIRT OFF AND THEN HIS
PANTS AND THEN HIS UNDERWEAR AND

47
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:10,770
THEN HIS SOCKS?

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,930
AND THEN HE TIED
HIMSELF UP IN THE NYLON ROPE?

49
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,519
THERE WAS STILL NOTHING YOU
COULD DO?

50
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:17,519
MY GOD, GETTING OUT OF

51
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,420
THE CAR, YOU OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T
DO THAT BUT YOU HAD TO STAY

52
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,579
IN COUNCIL THE GUY.

53
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:24,769
I HAVE TO JUMP IN.

54
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,810
PART OF
ME IS IRRITATED WITH THIS PASTOR

55
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,400
BECAUSE OF THE HYPOCRISY.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,730
THE L
BG T COMMUNITY FACE

57
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,310
DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME

58
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,540
STILL DUE TO THE STABLE PART OF
ME FEELS REALLY BAD FOR HIM

59
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,489
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN LIVING THIS
LIFE FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT

60
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:44,969
MUST BE A TERRIBLE EXISTENCE SO
I HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR HIM

61
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,340
AND I HOPE THAT ONE DAY HE CAN
LIVE HIS AUTHENTIC SELF,

62
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,830
HIS AUTHENTIC LIFE.

63
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,861
IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF ANA
KASPARIAN, YOU DO YOU, BOO.

64
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:53,861
IF

65
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:58,519
YOU WANTED TIED IT UP WITH NYLON
ROPES, HAVE AT IT.

66
00:02:58,519 --> 00:02:59,519
BUT JUST

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T DENY WHO YOU ACTUALLY ARE.
