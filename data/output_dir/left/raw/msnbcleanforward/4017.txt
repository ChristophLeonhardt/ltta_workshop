Rachel and of course I was taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes</font>

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">learning all about Dana buente and</font>

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,410
actually taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes about his notes it</font>

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,980
was really extraordinary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see you</font>

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,929
revealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> those actual handwritten notes</font>

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,210
which I would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">until they were introduced as exhibits</font>

9
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">either in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> court room or in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing</font>

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,650
and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress it really is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as far</font>

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">as the notes go a word-for-word</font>

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">corroboration of what James</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cummings</font>

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,850

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">me as a layman looking at this stuff is</font>

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,129
that people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trained in the FBI</font>

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Justice Department people are</font>

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">occasion and Comey obviously was relying</font>

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,100
on his own notes from his conversations

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,149
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the president when he put together</font>

relying<font color="#E5E5E5"> on his own notes and he was</font>

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,430
probably relying on those same note he

28
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,600
may have been relying on those same

33

<font color="#E5E5E5">course completely unsurprising to those</font>

55

of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> who know Jim Comey and know that</font>

56

<font color="#E5E5E5">if he tells some tells you something</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in a congressional hearing</font>

58
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,120
and there's going to be corroboration of

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,569
it then

60
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,189
the corroboration is going to show you

61
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:15,989
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what happened and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">but I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the least bit surprised and</font>

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they show that as as Rachel</font>

66
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,730
reported and that that what Jim said was

67
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,609
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate in you know almost</font>

68
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:38,189

<font color="#E5E5E5">and I would urge people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

74
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,419
his testimony<font color="#CCCCCC"> to watch that testimony</font>

75
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,019
and to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the substance of the</font>

76
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,810
things that he said and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it helps that</font>

77
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we now have the then Deputy</font>

opinion from Benjamin Buddhist about
