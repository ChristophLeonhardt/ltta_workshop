1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,339
The Philippines is one of only two countries
in the world where divorce is illegal.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,710
The only other is Vatican City - and with
a population of under 1,000 made up of mostly

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,190
nuns and priests, divorce isn’t in very
high demand.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,590
But in the Philippines, a country with more
than 40,000 married couples, more than half

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,900
the population supports legalizing the practice.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,780
And as a legalization bill makes it way through
the courts … will Filipinos in unhappy marriages

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,530
finally get the chance to move on?

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,710
Hey guys I’m Alex, this is NowThis World,
and on this episode we’re looking at how

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,579
the Philippines became one the last countries
in the world with a ban on divorce, and how

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,929
that affects its people.

11
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,000
First... a little background.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,480
Divorce technically isn’t illegal for everyone.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,930
For the approximately 5% of the population
who identify as Muslim in the overwhelmingly

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,260
Catholic state, divorce is allowed.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,629
That’s because Muslim Filipinos adhere to
a separate legal system called the "Code of

16
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:54,629
Muslim Personal Laws.”

17
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,409
And, the process hasn't always been illegal
- even for non-Muslims.

18
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,820
During decades of Spanish colonization from
the 15th to 19th centuries, the practice was

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,819
all but banned in the Philippines.

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,690
But under the U.S. and Japanese occupations
in the early 1900s, divorce was legalized

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,830
- within certain limitations.

22
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,310
A few years after the country gained independence
from the U.S., the Civil Code of the Philippines

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,700
banned it again in 1950.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,000
“ The Catholic church once more reasserted
itself in Philippine politics.”

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,170
That is Attorney Evalyn Ursua.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,970
She wrote the original divorce bill that’s
been adapted into the current proposal moving

27
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,320
through the courts.

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,800
She says the Catholic Church wields a significant
influence over state.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,980
“The Catholic line is, marriage is sacred,
and those who are married should stay together

30
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,980
forever.

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:49,820
But we are a secular society, there is on
our constitution there is separation of church

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,910
and state.

33
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,790
So the Catholic church should not impose its
precepts, its morals, on everyone.”

34
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,390
And today, there are only a few ways for Filipino
couples to separate.

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,180
And none of them are quick or easy fixes.

36
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,940
The first option, is annulment.

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,090
It’s expensive, lengthy, and requires couples
to meet very strict legal guidelines.

38
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,549
People seeking an annulment have to meet requirements
that including impotence, undisclosed STDs,

39
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:18,769
lack of parental consent, and a few others.

40
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,540
But domestic violence?

41
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,920
Physical or verbal abuse?

42
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,549
Irreconcilable differences?

43
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,670
According to Article 45 of the Family Code
of the Philippines, those don’t meet the

44
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,329
standards for an annulment.

45
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:33,690
Under a legal separation, couples can live
separately and divide their possessions, but

46
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,690
the agreement doesn’t legally end a marriage
and therefore doesn’t allow either party

47
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,690
to remarry.

48
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,939
Grounds for filing a legal separation include
physical abuse and infidelity, among others.

49
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:48,780
To declare a marriage null and void, the couple
must prove that a valid marriage never legally

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,780
existed - that it was considered invalid from
the beginning.

51
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,840
The most common route attorneys take to prove
a marriage null and void is by proving that

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,629
either one or both parties has a “psychological
incapacity” to fulfill marital duties.

53
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:06,529
That usually involves a clinical psychologist
or psychiatrist who has to perform a mental

54
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:09,569
evaluation, and produce a report with the
results.

55
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,810
And Attorney Ursua says that’s enough to
keep many couples from moving forward with

56
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,810
the separation.

57
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:23,069
“I’ve had clients who refuse to be declared
psychologically incapacitated, especially

58
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:29,540
if they knew that they worked hard to make
the marriage work, they did their best.”

59
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,379
Aside from the many years it can take to overcome
these obstacles, legal proceedings can also

60
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:39,010
cost tens or hundreds of thousand of dollars,
and still there’s no guarantee the courts

61
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,299
will rule in favor of separation.

62
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,040
People who have no money to pay for the services
of a lawyer are usually stuck in their marriage.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,700
According to the Philippine Statistics Authority,
about one in five Filipinos experience poverty.

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,870
The average annulment starts at around 250,000
Philippine pesos, or approximately $4,800

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,870
USD.

66
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,760
That’s hardly less than the average family
income in the Philippines for an entire year,

67
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,209
which is about $5,000 USD.

68
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,420
This huge cost fosters a breeding ground for
scammers, who pose as lawyers offering lower

69
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,370
rates and guarantees of favorable rulings.

70
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,959
These prices also lead many people to simply
abandon their marriages.

71
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,510
But for some women, abandoning their marriage
isn’t an option.

72
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,990
One in seven married women in the Philippines
say they have been physically abused by their

73
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,390
husbands, and 8% say they’ve been sexually
abused by their husbands.

74
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,199
Many end up stuck out of fear of retaliation
or financial despair.

75
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,419
And that leads us to a very important point
- how these strict marriage termination rules

76
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,789
disproportionately affect women.

77
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:44,940
Women may make up half the country’s population,
but only 46% of them are working, compared

78
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,740
to 76% of men.

79
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,290
That means that many women rely on their husbands
for financial support.

80
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,130
That, coupled with the pervasive social stigma
surrounding ending a marriage, which is particularly

81
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,110
strong for women who are expected to hold
the family together, makes it not only logistically

82
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,610
difficult to seek an annulment or legal separation,
but financially and emotionally challenging

83
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,610
as well.

84
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,539
We spoke to one Filipina woman who says she
felt pressured into getting married and now

85
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:14,050
she is working with a lawyer to figure out
the best way for her to move on from her marriage.

86
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,030
“I got married at 19.

87
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,780
At that age, you’re not matured enough to
make wise decisions for yourself.

88
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,130
The question that was given to me was not,
do you want to get married?

89
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,580
Are you ready to get married?

90
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,940
But rather, why don’t you get married at
this date?

91
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,000
At that point, I could not say no.”

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,970
The lower house recently passed the bill,
passing the baton to the more conservative

93
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,970
Senate, who must pass a counterpart divorce
bill.

94
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,220
Then, it would head to President Duterte’s
desk, who could veto it altogether.

95
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,880
Duterte has previously expressed opposition
to the bill, despite having his own marriage

96
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,240
annulled before entering office.

97
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,389
But Speaker Alvarez, an ally of the President,
said he is optimistic that he can convince

98
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,210
Duterte to sign off on what he called the
“dissolution of marriage.”

99
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,650
Alvarez thinks it’s time for the Philippines
to catch up to the rest of the world.

100
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:11,289
“It’s a badge of stupidity… because
we are the only country left that hasn’t

101
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:12,479
seen the problem.

102
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,479
“

103
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,449
The proposed divorce legislation would make
it easier for low-income people to get free

104
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,669
legal representation and loosen the grounds
for seeking separation in the first place.

105
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:28,280
“If I were to get a divorce, it would mean
a lot to me, because it would mean freedom

106
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
for me.

107
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,100
I don’t have to use his name.

108
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,110
And also for my ex, he can marry his partner.

109
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,200
Sometimes you just want to be in love again,
you want to be with a person who truly cares

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:00:00,000
for you and respects you.”
