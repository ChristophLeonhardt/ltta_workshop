in Lawrence thanks Rachel it's been an extraordinary night watching this develop Governor Cuomo who has not had a comfortable relationship with Attorney General Eric Schneiderman both Democrats called for Schneiderman's resignation within the last hour and a half or so and that resignation was delivered right around an hour or so after the governor asked for it and this was something no one could have possibly seen coming this is again extraordinary reporting by Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow at The New Yorker Jane mayor is going to join us in a bit to tell us how this came about but this raises big political questions in New York State as you said you referred to the notoriously insane New York state legislature which many would call a charitable description and as you pointed out it falls to them now to choose the next Attorney General that's right and at a time when I mean attorneys general are always powerful jobs they're always important jobs in New York State the Attorney General position has been a particularly high-profile job it has been a stepping stone to the governor both for Eliot Spitzer and for the current Governor Andrew Cuomo it has an even higher profile than usual because of the what's we've been reported as a cooperative relationship between Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the special counsels office for albert Mohler some of the charges that have been brought already or or investigated by the special counsels office could conceivably also be pursued as state matters and there's been a question as to whether or not that might happen through Schneiderman's office if if the president is able to somehow dismantle the federal investigation or issue federal pardons this has implications in in the personal lives of any women who may have been affected by these alleged activities it has serious implications in Schneiderman's life it has big political consequences in New York and it has national implications too and we've both had Eric Schneiderman on our shows since the trouble administration began he was one of the first attorneys general to come out and start explaining the powers that that state attorneys general have to confront this presidency even before there was a special prosecutor on issues like the Muslim ban that the president tried to introduce and other policies and Eric Schneiderman even as I say even before we got to any issues of special prosecutors investigation and what Eric Schneiderman might be able to do that could be a state companion to that Eric Schneiderman was one of the attorneys general leading the resistance to the Trump presidency well that I mean even if you could wipe the slate clean and know nothing else about anything that had happened in the last year and a half to just know that right before he took office the president agreed to pay twenty five million dollars to settle a civil fraud case brought in the Trump University matter that those that fraud case was brought by Eric Schneiderman other State's Attorney General's did end up getting involved in that but Schneiderman was the one who led the way the president settled that had to pay twenty five million dollars that settlement was just finalized within the last couple of weeks the president responded in part by countersuing Eric Schneiderman in a personal capacity for having pursued that I mean being a state attorney general is always a big deal being one in New York is an even bigger deal being Eric Schneiderman in this era in the Trump era has been as high-profile as you can get with this kind of job and to have this bolt from the blue in The New Yorker tonight and now he's gone before dinner's over this is just a remarkable remarkable turn Aviva it has been an extraordinary night yeah thank you very much rachel weisz well we are joined now by phone by Jane Mayer who broke this story today in The New Yorker and Jane I was going to read a description for the audience of what it was that you discovered and that you reported about Attorney General General Eric Schneiderman that forced this resignation tonight but I'm going to now leave it to you to tell us what the key elements of your reporting are that forced the Attorney General of New York State to resign tonight well there were four women who were romantically involved with him in the past who have described just repeated episodes of non-consensual violence inflicted on them by him but they these are episodes range from someone who was just plain you know a single situation where Attorney General's started men made a sexual advance to her and she is a very well-known attorney in New York and a very prominent person and just out of the blue he according to her hit her incredibly hard across the face twice and there were photographs of this that we were able to see they were taken the next day so that's just a one-time thing to than the descriptions of similar kinds of activity that got were prolonged over a year or even longer from relationships that these some of the other women had with him who were really girlfriends and descriptions of being slapped repeatedly in the face choked which was really particularly disturbing because he was the lead sponsor of the strangulation law in New York that made it a serious crime to try to choke someone because it's so often an indicator of really serious violence in domestic violence cases so it's it was just it was just the most unexpected thing he's been such a star in the Democratic Party and you know I don't think nobody's taking any great pleasure in this his these were women who supported him who do I think you know we're crazy about him at some point but they were stuck in this situation that was really like being battered women it was kind of amazing before the Attorney General announced his resignation tonight he did give a comment to the to you at The New Yorker saying in the privacy of intimate relationships I haven't aged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity I have not assaulted anyone I have never engaged in non-consensual sex which is a line I would not cross is there in your reporting did you find any possibility for confusion here about his view of something at all you know and it was something we were very sensitive to not wanting to invade Sean's privacy or you know that was just you know some kind of you know idiosyncratic sex life or something like that but what what the - there are two women in this story who are on the record and they are speaking out because they really felt it was so important at this point and they wanted to make sure that other women didn't fall into the same situation with him but both of those women on the record used the word assault and they say that this was non-consensual and that they were subjected to it over and over and that it included also a lot of very demeaning psychological what they described as abuse and and the pattern just having done a lot of reporting here it just repeated itself with each person that we interviewed and it became familiar it was it was really kind of horrendous did the victims complain to him and did he say anything to them by way of apology in any kind of verbal explanation about this well we're talking about something that would that went on we're talking about over you know a decade here so a lot of different things happened but but yes there were there were these women say that they told him to stop and he didn't sometimes they would think that maybe he'd get better maybe they could get therapy maybe they could maybe it was their fault he they went through a lot of different things but basically they did not consent to this activity that's violence and they were incredibly upset and eventually broke up with him so he made them feel that it was their fault and they weren't liberated enough for putting up with it is one of the things that that I came across in a number of occasions jayna's you were preparing this story for publication just hours ago did it feel before publication that it could lead to the resignation of the Attorney General within hours I thought it might I didn't know how fast it would happen but I think given how important women's rights are to the Democratic Party and you know the me2 movement has been for democratic leaders it didn't seem possible that he could behave in one way that one of the women on the record describes I served you know it's a dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde to be so different in public and private I see I thought that he might say just a complete firestorm Jane Bayer thank you very much for joining us tonight on this extraordinary set night of developments as a result of your reporting in The New Yorker really appreciate your giving us the time hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
