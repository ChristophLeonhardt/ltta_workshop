00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,985
>>> TWO YOUNG CONSERVATIVES

2
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:14,023
PENNED AN OP ED IN THE WEEK LID

3
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:16,024
STANDARD HIGHLIGHTING THE GAP

4
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:18,660
BETWEEN OLD AND YOUNG

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,094
CONSERVATIVES.

6
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:24,533
ACCORDING TO A PUGH RESEARCH

7
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:31,006
STUDY, MILLENNIALS CONSIDERED

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,075
VIEWS, AND THEN THE NUMBER

9
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,445
BALLOONED WITH 15% MILLENNIALS

10
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:37,780
CALLING THEMSELVES CONSERVATIVE.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,915
WHAT SHOULD THE CONSERVATIVES

12
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,017
NEED TO DO TO APPEAL TO

13
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:42,651
MILLENNIALS.

14
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:45,954
LET'S ASK OUR MILLENNIAL PANEL.

15
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:52,161
CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL NOELLES,

16
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:52,194
CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'OELLES,

17
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:52,227
CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'NOLLES,

18
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:52,261
CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'NOLEES,

19
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:52,561
CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'NOLES,,

20
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,262
CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'NOLES, A

21
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,432
PODCASTER AND ALI.

22
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,599
GOOD MORNING TO ALL OF YOU.

23
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,167
>> GOOD MORNING.

24
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,269
>> LET'S START WITH YOU,

25
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:00,602
CHARLIE.

26
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,970
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS

27
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,305
AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT

28
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:03,605
SNIT.

29
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,174
>> FIRST, I'LL TAKE A LITTLE

30
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:06,442
EXCEPTION WITH THE ANALYSIS.

31
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,477
I THINK IT'S MORE TRAGIC ON THE

32
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:09,678
DEMOCRAT SIDE THAN ON THE

33
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:10,279
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

34
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,881
YOU'VE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF

35
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:15,017
YEARS, FAVORABILITY OF YOUNG

36
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:16,585
PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE TOWARD THE

37
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:18,053
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ABSOLUTELY GO

38
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:19,354
DOWN TREMENDOUSLY.

39
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:20,923
BARACK OBAMA GOT 66% OF THE

40
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:24,893
YOUTH VOTE IN 2008 AND 20% IN

41
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:25,194
2012.

42
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:27,729
HILLARY CLINTON WAS AROUND 51%,

43
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:27,996
52%.

44
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:29,498
THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR

45
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:30,432
DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS.

46
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:32,835
THE CORE ISSUE IS THE TERM

47
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:33,268
CONSERVATIVE.

48
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:34,736
YOUNG PEOPLE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM,

49
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:36,205
FREE MARKETS, SMALLER

50
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:36,605
GOVERNMENT.

51
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:37,873
WHEN PROPERLY ARGUED TO THEM.

52
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:39,808
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE LEFT IS

53
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:44,413
SO GOOD AT STIGMATIZING THIS

54
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:44,913
TERM CONSERVATIVE.

55
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:47,249
A WORD WE KNEAD

56
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:47,282
A WORD WE NNEAD

57
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:47,316
A WORD WE NEEAD

58
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:47,683
A WORD WE NEEDD

59
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,284
A WORD WE NEED TO RECLAIM.

60
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:50,919
>> SHOULD CONSERVATIVES BE

61
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,654
FOCUSED ON FREEDOM, LIBERTY

62
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,256
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT

63
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:56,425
THE YOUNG CONSERVATIVES ON GAY

64
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:57,659
MARRIAGE, MARIJUANA USE ARE MORE

65
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,094
ABOUT FREEDOM AND LIBERTY?

66
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:00,696
>> ABSOLUTELY.

67
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:03,799
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO REALLY IS

68
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,267
THAT MILLENNIALS CARE MORE ABOUT

69
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,635
THE WHY THAN THE WHAT.

70
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:07,803
RATHER THAN TALKING ABOUT THE

71
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:11,240
WHAT OF POLICIES OR POLITICS OF

72
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,141
CONSERVATISM, WE NEED TO TALK

73
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:14,009
ABOUT WHY THE CONSERVATIVE

74
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,043
POLICIES ARE ACTUALLY BETTER

75
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:16,745
WITH NOT JUST FOR THE RICH WHITE

76
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,447
MALE BUT FOR EVERYONE.

77
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,682
WHY CONSERVATIVE POLICIES,

78
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,051
INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY CAPITALISM,

79
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:24,453
DEREGULATION ACTUALLY HELPS THE

80
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:27,389
PEOPLE THAT MILLENNIALS CARE

81
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,124
ABOUT, THOSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF

82
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:30,526
SOCIETY, THE IMMIGRANTS, THOSE

83
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,529
IN POVERTY, WOMEN, MINORITIES,

84
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,097
THE LGBT COMMUNITY.

85
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:35,764
CHARLIE IS RIGHT.

86
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,533
WE CARE ABOUT FREEDOM, WE CARE

87
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,503
ABOUT VIDDISM AND

88
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:41,537
ABOUT IIDDISM AND

89
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:41,570
ABOUT INDDISM AND

90
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:41,603
ABOUT INDIVSM AND

91
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:41,637
ABOUT INDIVID AND

92
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:41,670
ABOUT INDIVIDUAND

93
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,471
ABOUT INDIVIDUALISM AND THOSE

94
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:45,641
TWO THINGS DON'T SEE SKIN COLOR

95
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:46,742
OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

96
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:48,710
>> ARE OLDER CONSERVATIVES

97
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,712
REALLY REACHING OUT TO SAY THE

98
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,780
LGBT COMMUNITY AS YOU SUGGEST

99
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,581
THEY SHOULD?

100
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:54,049
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE.

101
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,318
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT US TO GET

102
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:58,587
INTO IDENTITY POLITICS.

103
00:02:58,587 --> 00:02:59,922
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT.

104
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:01,523
>> I'M NOT BUT YOU JUST

105
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:01,957
MENTIONED IT.

106
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:04,293
>> BUT CONVEYING A MESSAGE THAT

107
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,161
APPEALS TO PEOPLE OF ALL SEXUAL

108
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,630
ORIENTATIONS AND BACKGROUND.

109
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,566
IT'S NOT JUST THE BABY BOOMER'S

110
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,202
JOB BUT IT'S THE MILLENNIALS

111
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,203
JOB, THE WORK OF EVERYONE ON

112
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:16,171
THIS PANEL THAT WE DO EVERY DAY,

113
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,173
GOING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES,

114
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,042
HAVING THE POD COST, THE SHOWS

115
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,710
THAT WE PUT OUT, IT'S OUR JOB

116
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,045
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I

117
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:24,680
THINK WE'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD

118
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,614
JOB.

119
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,549
>> MICHAEL, CHARLIE SEEMED TO

120
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,884
THINK THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM

121
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:30,819
FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

122
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,221
DO YOU AGREE?

123
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,157
>> I AGREE ENTIRELY.

124
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:37,960
THIS IS A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENCY

125
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,560
THUS FAR.

126
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,362
WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP DID

127
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:42,531
BETTER AMONG MILLENNIALS THAN

128
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:44,666
EITHER JOHN McCAIN OR MITT

129
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,835
ROMNEY.

130
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,771
BETTER THAN ROMNEY AMONG

131
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,274
HISPANICS AND THAT POPULATION

132
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,308
HAS INCREASED TWO AR THREEN

133
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:55,077
TIMES IN THE LAST SEVERAL

134
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:55,644
DECADES.

135
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,547
IT'S OVERWHELMINGLY YOUNG AND

136
00:03:58,547 --> 00:03:59,181
MILLENNIAL.

137
00:03:59,181 --> 00:03:59,982
NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT TRUMP

138
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,984
DID FAIRLY WELL.

139
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:03,752
IN 1984 RONALD REAGAN'S SUPPORT

140
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:07,022
AMONG YOUNG VOTERS SURGED BY

141
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,957
NEARLY 40%.

142
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,158
HIS PRESIDENCY WAS SUCCESSFUL.

143
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:11,793
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW

144
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,862
WEEKS, EXCELLENT DIPLOMACY IN

145
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:15,430
NORTH KOREA, GOOD ECONOMY,

146
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,600
RETURNED HOSTAGES, THE KANYE

152
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,170
AWAKENING IN PUBLIC.

153
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,905
THE ONLY POLL THAT'S GOING TO

154
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:26,675
MATTER IS NOVEMBER 2020.

155
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:30,212
>> CHARLIE BEN SHAPIRO WROTE

156
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,780
CAUGHT MY EYE, THE DATA SHOWS

157
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,883
THAT THE YOUNG CONSERVATIVES

158
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:39,288
TEND TOWARD LIBERTARIANISM ON

159
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:42,557
DRUGS AND SEX BUT SHARE THE SAME

160
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:46,028
PRIORITIES ON OLDER INDIVIDUALS

161
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,563
ON FISCAL.

162
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:51,099
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE ALLUDED TO

163
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:51,400
THAT.

164
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,367
LOOK, DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING

165
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,101
RESULTS ON THE ECONOMY AND MA

166
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:55,137
THE MAKER

167
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:55,170
THE MATER

168
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,038
THE MATTERS TO PEOPLE.

169
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:57,939
>> HIS VIEW HAS BEEN ON THE

170
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,107
FOREIGN POLICY ECONOMIC MATTERS

171
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:01,843
AND A DE-EMPHASIS ON THE

172
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,611
CONTROVERSIAL DIVISIVE SOCIAL

173
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:02,944
ISSUES.

174
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,346
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

175
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,447
REASONS WHY HE'S GOING TO

176
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,316
CONTINUE TO DO WELL WITH ALL

177
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:09,017
VOTERS BUT ESPECIALLY YOUNG

178
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,252
VOTERS HEADING INTO 2020.

179
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,087
WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUNG PEOPLE

180
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:13,722
AND SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATS, A

181
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:14,890
YOUNG PERSON VOTING FOR

182
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,758
DEMOCRATS IS LIKE A CHICKEN

183
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:18,093
VOTING FOR COLONEL SANDERS.

184
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:19,494
THEY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THEY

185
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:19,761
CAN.

186
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,296
IT'S OUR GENERATION THAT'S GOING

187
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:23,765
TO BE HURT THE MOST BY

188
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,734
DEMOCRATIC POLICIES AND

189
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:26,134
POLITICIANS.

190
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:27,469
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DISENGAGING

191
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:29,471
FROM THE RIGHT VERSUS LEFT

192
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,805
LABELS.

193
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:30,672
DEMOCRAT VERSUS REPUBLICAN.

194
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,307
BUT AGAIN, DEMOCRATS NEED

195
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:33,308
YOUNGER VOTERS.

196
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,943
IT'S ONE OF THE THREE GROUPS

197
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,812
THAT THEY PRIMARILY NEED TO GET

198
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:38,880
BASE TURNOUT FOR SO THAT EVERY

199
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,816
OUNCE OF SUPPORT THEY LOSE HURTS

200
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:41,917
THEM A LOT MORE THAN REPUBLICANS

201
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,885
>> THE LAST POINT HERE, WILL

202
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,554
OLDER CONSERVATIVES SAY HANG ON,

203
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,089
IF YOU'RE FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY

204
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:50,425
AND NOT ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE,

205
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,394
ARE YOU PULLING BACK FROM

206
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,595
TRADITIONAL VALUES THAT MIGHT

207
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:56,365
UPSET OLDER CONSERVATIVES ?

208
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,199
-L.

209
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,867
>> WE'RE WINNING THE CULTURAL

210
00:05:58,867 --> 00:05:59,134
WAR.

211
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:01,236
I THINK SOME CONSERVATIVES ARE

212
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,138
MISSING IT BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED

213
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:05,340

US TO START LISTENING TO BARACK.

221
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,214
WHAT WINNING IS CHANCE THE

00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:13,648
RAPPER TWEETING OUT SAYING BLACK

223
00:06:13,648 --> 00:06:16,318
PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO VOTE FOR

00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:17,919

MILLENNIALS ARE INDIVIDUALISTS.

HOW WE APPEAL TO THEM, IT'S

237
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,735
CONSERVATISM THAT WANTS YOU TO
