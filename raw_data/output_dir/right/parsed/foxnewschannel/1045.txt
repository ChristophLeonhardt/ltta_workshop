>>  WHILE OTHER WORLD LEADERS
AND EVEN SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS
ON CAPITOL HILL AREN'T A FAN OF
THE PRESIDENT'S NEW TARIFFS,
AMERICAN VOTERS ARE MORE
OPTIMISTIC THAN EVER ABOUT HOW
THE PRESIDENT IS NAVIGATING THE
ECONOMY.
A NEW FOX NEWS POLL, 50% OF
AMERICANS APPROVE OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S HANDLING OF THE ECONOMY.
HERE TO WAY IN ROSS COMISKEY.
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THIS IS MY QUESTION, YOU'VE GOT
THE DOW AND STOCK MARKETS NEAR
RECORD HIGHS, UNEMPLOYMENT NEAR
RECORD LOWS, HUGE INNOVATION IN
PLACES LIKE DENVER WHERE YOU
LIVE.
52% OF AMERICANS APPROVE HOW THE
PRESIDENT IS HANDLING OF THE
ECONOMY AND WHAT ARE THE OTHER
48% COMPLAINING ABOUT?
>> WELL, A LOT OF THE ISSUES
WHERE DONALD TRUMP INTERACTS
WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN ANY
WAY, TRADE, IMMIGRATION, FOREIGN
POLICY GENERALLY, THEY'RE A
LITTLE MORE NEGATIVE ABOUT, BUT
I ALSO THINK SOME OF IT IS JUST
NO MATTER WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
DOES, SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST BOUND
AND DETERMINED IN THEIR OWN
MINDS, I'M JUST NOT GOING TO
LIKE THIS GUY AND WE SAW IT WITH
OTHER PRESIDENTS AS WELL, BUT
MORE WITH TRUMP THAN WITH OTHERS
AP REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
ARE THEY GOING TO VOTE BASED ON
WHETHER THEY LIKE HIM OR LIKE
3.8% UNEMPLOYMENT.
LELAND: IT'S FASCINATING YOU
BRING THAT UP.
OUR FRIENDS OVER AT AXIOS
BROUGHT UP THESE DATA POINTS
THAT WERE PROFOUND.
IF YOU WERE TO FORECAST THE 2018
MIDTERMS HISTORICALLY BY
PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL, THE
G.O.P. WOULD LOSE 68 SEATS.
VIEW OF THE ECONOMY, BASED OFF
THE POLLS WE JUST SHOWED YOU THE
G.O.P. WOULD GAIN 55 SEATS.
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE
MIDDLE THERE.
>> YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOU.
ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK IT SOUNDS TRITE, BUT
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHO
IS MORE MOTIVATED.
IT HAS FELT LIKE DEMOCRATS WERE
MORE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT TO THE
POLLS IN THIS CYCLE THAN
REPUBLICANS, BUT THE PROBLEM FOR
DEMOCRATS IS THEY'RE NOT REALLY
GIVING PEOPLE A REASON TO VOTE
FOR THEM OTHER THAN JUST SAYING,
I'M
I'
I'M NOT THIS GU OR DON'T SUPPORT
THIS GUY AND THAT'S NOT USUALLY
ENOUGH.
LELAND: A LOT OF THE COMPLAINTS
YOU HEAR ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP
ARE ALMOST MORE ABOUT STYLE THAN
SUBSTANCE.
FOREIGN POLICY, HE GETS HIGH
MARKS FOR GOING TO KIM JONG-UN
IN SINGAPORE AND SITTING DOWN
FOR THIS MEETING, BUT AMERICANS
ARE STILL SKEPTICAL.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WILL NORTH KOREA EVER GIVE UP
ITS NUKES.
NOW 28% VERSUS 60 NO.
MARCH 2018, 16%-76 SAID NO.
SO YOU'VE HAD ABOUT 12% MORE
AMERICANS NOW SAY THEY MIGHT
GIVE UP THEIR NUKES.
IN TERMS OF MIDTERM ELECTION
POLITICS, HOW IMPORTANT ARE YOU
SEEING THIS SUMMIT?
>> I THINK IT'S ENORMOUS.
I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS STAKED
A LOT OF OF HIS OWN CREDIBILITY
ON IT AS A DEALMAKER AND WHEN
THIS FIRST STARTED GOING ON, A
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING, THIS
IS VERY HIGH STAKES AND IT'S
GOING TO LEAD TO WAR OR NOT AND
I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY IS THE
AREA WHERE IT'S HIGH STAKES.
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY HIGH
STAKES FOR DOMESTIC POLITICS.
I THINK THAT TRUMP HAS A LOT
RIDING ON THIS AND TO THE EXTENT
THAT HIS NUMBERS ARE KIND OF
NEGATIVE IN AREAS THAT DEAL WITH
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THIS IS
A WAY WHERE HE COULD CHANGE THAT
ALMOST OVERNIGHT.
LELAND: EVEN HAWKISH MEMBERS OF
THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS UP ON
CAPITOL HILL, EVEN HAWKISH
MEMBERS WHO ARE FANS OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP WORRY THAT FOR
JUST THE REASONS YOU POINT OUT,
THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE
DEALITIS, ESSENTIALLY BEING
WILLING TO DO ANYTHING KIM
JONG-UN WANTS TO GET A DEAL,
EVEN IF IN MANY VIEW, IT WOULD
BE A BAD DEAL, AGREE?
>> I DON'T AGREE.
I THINK THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS
THAT GUY, AND I THINK THAT
DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY SAID
EXPLICITLY, MAYBE IT WAS
YESTERDAY, I'M WILLING TO WALK
AWAY.
I DID IT ONCE BEFORE.
I'M WILLING TO WALK AWAY AGAIN.
I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR
DONALD TRUMP'S OWN PSYCHE AS
WELL--
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO GET A
GOOD DEAL THAN NO DEAL.
LELAND: TO PUSH BACK, THE
PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS WILLING TO
TALK AWAY FROM A DEAL WITH ZTE,
AND THE CHINESE AND SO MANY NOW
EVEN REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING HE
ROLLED OVER ON THAT ONE.
>> AND I THINK HE DID, I AGREE
WITH THAT CRITICISM.
LELAND: WHY DO YOU TRUST HIM NOW
THAT HE'S WILLING TO HOLD OUT
FOR A GOOD DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA
WHEN YOU'RE SAYING HE ROLLED
OVER WITH CHINA?
>> YEAH, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT
THE NORTH KOREA THING IS SO MUCH
MORE OUT IN PUBLIC.
ZTE, THOSE WHO PAY ATTENTION TO
POLITICS NOTICE THAT, BUT THIS
NOT SO MUCH.
NOT JUST AMERICA IS TALKING
ABOUT IT, THE WORLD IS TALKING
ABOUT IT AND I THINK TRUMP WILL
THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY AND I
THINK HE DID THE ZTE THINK IN
ORDER TO GET MORE HELP FROM
CHINA BEHIND THE SCENES ON THE
NORTH KOREA THING.
SO, THAT'S MY TAKE THERE.
LELAND: WELL, WE'VE SEEN THE
CHINESE USE NORTH KOREA AS
LEVERAGE IN THESE TRADE DEALS.
ROSS, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.
WE COULD TALK TO YOU A LOT
LONGER.
YOU'RE HEADED TO SINGAPORE, SO
IF THIS SUMMIT KEEPS STRETCHING
OUT LIKE THE PRESIDENT SAID IT
MIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUR
MAN ON THE GROUND IN SINGAPORE,
