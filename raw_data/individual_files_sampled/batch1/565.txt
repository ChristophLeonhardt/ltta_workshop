this the latest batch of young hopefuls sitting the Afghan police entrance exam 70 young women were included in the 4,000 applicants the highest number to date it's a career about honor and survival I want to join the police to help defend my country and fight for the rights of my people and the rights of women the war in Afghanistan has touched many but few as hard as Samira and her family her two sisters nor all higher and minora were police officers in fizzy bod in Badakhshan province as they drove to work with their mother the Taliban stopped their car dragged the young women out and strangled them their bodies were dumped in the river they were targeted because they were police I couldn't do anything my daughters were screaming help me mother help me it was terrible the family had to flee the province after receiving death threats Samira still clutches the cord used to kill her sisters despite what happened she's determined to join up I am scared of the Taliban wherever they see us they will kill us perhaps they might riddle me with bullets or strangle me I can't go home anymore so I am determined to join the police for the memory of my sisters and to serve my country females in the security services are often treated more harshly by the Taliban which has consistently opposed women's rights those rights have steadily improved for some women in Afghanistan mainly in the cities but not as fast as many would have liked the drawing up of a new penal code left out a section about penalizing violence against women and a draft law aimed at making the harassment of women an offence has been left untouched for a year they deliver speeches and play politics with their words and the women of Afghanistan are tired of the empty promises and lies changing laws is one thing but changing the conservative mindsets in much of the country is quite another there's definitely more freedom of support for some women in the country today but even so the number of cases of physical and sexual abuse against women is not falling or rising last year saw an increase of 11% in those cases and 2,300 women and girls committed suicide because of abuse but in reality those figures are said to be much higher because many women are too scared to report violence to a male-dominated police force Samira's sisters were victims not only of war but also of deep-rooted discrimination it seems clear that long after the last bullet has been fired the women of Afghanistan will still be fighting a battle Toni Berkeley al Jazeera Kabul
