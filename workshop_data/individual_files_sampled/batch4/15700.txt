here's something that won't surprise you a majority of Brits believe the government is lying to them about immigration if you live outside the Westminster bubble or if you don't have a man bun and eat vegan cheese you know very well that there's an issue with immigration in the UK we know that immigration hasn't been entirely positive for the UK although if I'm honest if you do live in Westminster or London then you should really see the issue yourselves but it seems like there's some kind of sci-fi perception filter over London whereby the people who live there no matter how much crying happens no matter no matter how many terrible things happen they just keep on voting for the Labour Party and trusting the politicians it's a weird one but new figures show that a vast majority of Brits don't trust the politicians specifically on migration and they want to see the numbers of immigrants coming into the UK slashed the study was performed on behalf of British future a think tank and the anti-fascist hate group hope not hate the study is actually one of the most extensive done in the UK looking into the attitudes of British people on immigration and no doubt to hope not hates dismay only 15% of British people said that they believe ministers are managing immigration properly 15% and in me a 17% said they trusted the government to be honest about immigration just think about that only 17% that's less than 2 in 10 people think that the government can be trusted on immigration meaning most people think the government is just lying to them and I think they're right despite eight in ten people in Britain saying they believe that the government can't be trusted on immigration in a study performed on behalf of hope nor hate the government supported hate group hope now hey continues to demonize working-class people who are simply concerned about the future of the country now the report claims that the anti-muslim prejudice is widespread in the UK as well not just anti-immigrant prejudice but anti-muslim prejudice and the report says anti-muslim prejudice took different forms with the tendency to stereotype Muslims as a homogeneous community whose values and lifestyle are incompatible with the British Way of life in some citizens panels participants talked about Muslims taking over UK cities they believed that British culture was under threat because people were forced usually by schools and councils to pander to political correctness and the sensitivities of Muslims can you honestly disagree with that icon I think that's a real concern and yet hope not hate continues to ignore those concerns and this very real threat that we're facing and while pretending to listen to the working-class hope not hate and British future the other think tank that perform this study are only interested in demonizing mocking and manipulating those with concerns make no mistake the only reason that these studies even took place in the first place are a to justify their existence for hope not hate to justify their existence and continue getting funding you know create the Nazis and then oppose the Nazis and get funding to oppose the Nazis right but also they want to find out what people think so then they can just attack them for thinking what they think they create an enemy that simply doesn't exist they brand brand large communities as Nancy's and aid the further destruction of our society a nation now a word to hope not haste now when the vast majority of the country tells you that they don't trust the politicians to manage immigration and then they say that they're worried about their communities they're not Nazis they're just telling you the truth you you
