President Trump has fired 
F.B.I. director James Comey
over his handling of the investigation 
into Hillary Clinton’s emails.
Comey was also looking into 
whether Trump campaign associates
cooperated with Russia
to undermine the 2016 election.
Over the last year, Comey’s efforts
have led to strong pushback
from Trump over everything
from Clinton emails to Russia ties.
In July 2016, 
Comey issued a bombshell:
“We are expressing to Justice 
our view
that no charges are appropriate 
in this case.”
Trump wasn’t happy.
He took to Twitter.
Comey decided to broach 
the Clinton saga again, in October,
when he said there might
be new evidence in emails
forwarded by a top Clinton aide
to her husband, Anthony Weiner.
At the time,
Trump applauded the move.
“And it took guts for Director Comey
to make the move that he made,
in light of the kind
of opposition he had,
where they’re trying to protect her
from criminal prosecution.”
But Trump then used it
as a rationale for firing Comey.
Trump had long been
dogged by rumors
that members of his campaign
had ties to Russia.
“I own nothing in Russia.
I have no loans in Russia.
I don’t have any deals in Russia.
Russia is fake news.
Russia — this is fake news
put out by the media.”
In March 2017,
Comey made it official.
“That includes investigating
the nature of any links between
individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government.”
In March, the president
issued a surprising tweet,
saying Obama had wiretapped
Trump Tower.
Comey refuted that:
“With respect to the
president’s tweets
about alleged wiretapping directed
at him by the prior administration,
I have no information
that supports those tweets,
and we have looked carefully
inside the F.B.I.”
Trump then tried to walk it back:
“And don't forget,
when I say ‘wiretapped,’
those words were in quotes.”
Less than two months later,
Comey was out.
