11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,070
where I'm literally showing you how I

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,890
make some kind of recipe and usually it

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,740
ends up being<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of gluten-free</font>

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,420
situation the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that is that my</font>

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,120
husband within the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> year my husband</font>

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,860
realized that he had a gluten

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,469
intolerance and because of that cut out

18
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">gluten from his diet and so to give him</font>

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,570
the finer things in life like cookies

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,700
and cakes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of that I began</font>

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,670
experimenting in the kitchen and trying

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,469
different gluten-free flours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,480
of that nature because it's been so

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,109
interesting and I just like creating

25
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,160
content that interests me I've decided

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to create a new channel called sans</font>

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,939
gluten where I will show you all the

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,510
different recipes that I'm trying and
