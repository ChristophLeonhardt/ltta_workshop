the Government Accountability Office has done an analysis into Scot Pruitt's spending they specifically looked at that soundproof phone booth that he built in his government office he spent forty three thousand dollars on it was that the right thing to do or did he break some laws well according to the GAO the forty three thousand dollars soundproof phone booth Environmental Protection Agency administrator scott pruett installed in his office last year violated federal spending laws the GAO general counsel said the agency failed to notify lawmakers that it was exceeding the five thousand dollar limit for agency heads to furnish redecorate or otherwise make improvements to their offices the agency also violated the federal anti-deficiency Act because EPA obligated appropriated funds in a manner specifically prohibited by law now scott pruett response to all this criticism is it's necessary for me to be able to do my job like he's the head of the EPA no other head of the EPA has ever needed a soundproof phone booth in their office in fact they have soundproof booths for employees that need it it's just not in his office he would just have to walk into another room to use it by the way forty three thousand dollars to build a phone booth booth I don't care if it's the most soundproof booth ever it $43,000 I just I feel like some contracted employees here contracted businesses here might have taken advantage of the situation yeah look I don't know how much construction costs and in Washington I'm not surprised by that what I care a lot more about is why did he want that booth but let me give you a little further context here as well so a lot of the government offices have what is called a sensitive compartmented information facility known as a SCIF so if you are the head of the EPA and for some reason you have to take a top-secret call it's a little hard to conjure up a reason why you would need to do that let alone so regularly that you need to have a phone booth in your office to do it but but there could be some hey the Chinese of attack making up some al-qaeda attack I have a perfect example when you're hitting up your homies in Morocco and you're trying to convince them to purchase some liquefied natural gas from the United States because your homies in the US let them let you stay in their condo for like $50 a night maybe that that might be the real reason yeah but like the scenario contra for real need to do this is Al Qaeda's attacked us with anthrax you're the head of the Environmental Protection Agency I can tell you all about it so go down two floors to the this compartment and and we're gonna do a call on this but that was exceedingly rare right and when the inspector general or the GAO general counsel in this case looked at it they said this phone booth is not even certified as a SCIF so he can't even use it for that reason I should I can't with this guy so no look to Anna's point I understand why he wants a sound booth I mean when Ben Carson wants a $31,000 dining room table as he himself basically explained my wife wanted a nice table right nobody wants a nice sound booth that's not a thing that exists unless you're doing a radio show right there you want to soundproof phone booth why to make illicit calls calls your donors your previous donors to your future donors could calls to the industry you do not want trace including by the government if you go into the room that they have for you those calls are probably recorded you don't want that call recorded that's why you set up your own phone booths so you could do dirty deals because that's who scott pruett is he's dirty through and through and now he's broken a law but on the Trump administration it's not the bug that's the feature he'll probably be rewarded rather than punished exactly I don't I don't think there will be any consequences for him but it is interesting to see a government organization look into this and find that he did break laws you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
