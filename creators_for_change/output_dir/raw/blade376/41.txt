hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone hope all is well today I</font>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,950
wanted to talk about documentaries

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,919
generally because<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite frankly I love</font>

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,660
them and i'm a bit geeky when watching

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,670
documentaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like to sit there with a</font>

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,089
notepad and take notes and in some cases

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,340
i'll watch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to sit</font>

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,010
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and enjoy just consume the feeling</font>

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,930
of it and then the second time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,789
over it and then you know pick out bits

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,260
of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do more</font>

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,330
research on later<font color="#E5E5E5"> i created a massive</font>

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,490
list of documentaries i wanted to see

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,189
and what I found quite depressing was

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,739
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> over 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long but I started sharing</font>

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,600
it with friends who you know what asking

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,280
what documentary should i watch now and

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,710
what I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> find is I'd send them this list</font>

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they always get back to me and go oh</font>

20
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,890
but have you seen this one I'm like

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,350
really so I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list here I just</font>

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,090
realized a notification popped up that

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunate first I'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,539
name several documentaries that I have

25
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,860
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I highly recommend</font>

32
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,320

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world in a different way and in</font>

34

differently dirty wars which is a

36
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,509
fantastic documentary about America's

Edward Snowden for me it's probably one

52
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,500
of the most important documentaries<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

53
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,329

58
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,799
where documentaries can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really create</font>

59
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,410
huge social change because we live on

had a real personal impact on you and

70
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,760
then there's the documentary that you

every month I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I'm gonna do one</font>

88
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,630
video about a particular documentary

89
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,460
I've seen that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think everyone should</font>

90
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,770
check out and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will lay out five key</font>

92
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,040
we'll be a teaser to watch the full

93
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,320
documentary but I think we'll also be

94
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,180
informative as well so by doing this

95
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,160
video it gives you an opportunity so you

96
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,340
just shout at me any documentary<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

97
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,290
think I should watch right now I'm sure

98
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,580
there are going to be lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of comments</font>

99
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,030
on this video but I look forward to

100
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,820
adding to this list of over a hundred

101
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,020
it's probably gonna quadruped or

102
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,519
something like that but when it comes to

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,709
a new video series it requires a name

104
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,720
and I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up with really</font>

105
