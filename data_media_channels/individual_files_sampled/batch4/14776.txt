Bernie Sanders is a guy who he is a communist a terrible terrible human being a guy who would like to see the United States looked like Soviet Russia in the 1960s a guy who's a world-class hypocrite because his wife is out there ripping off colleges and being criminally charged for doing so and he has multiple homes when he talks about socialism and wants everybody to live in a communal style accept him accept him and his wife Bernie Sanders tweeted and this infuriates me the killing of Palestinian demonstrators no they were terrorists they were terrorists attacking Israel's border killing of Palestinian demonstrators by Israeli forces in Gaza is tragic it is the right of all people to protest for a better future without a violent response now Bernie Sanders and I agree with the second sentence and it's the right of all people to peacefully protest for a better future without a violent response but it is not their right to launch an armed attack on Israel and call it a protest it's not their right to Pelt soldiers with rocks to use weapons to make their point because that's not a protest that's a terror attack that's an invasion and Israel had every right to defend itself he added meanwhile the situation in Gaza remains the Amana terian disaster the US must play a more positive role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all as Palestinians are no interest in peace now I've done my own homework on this and one of the things that was shocking to me is that when I started to research Gaza and the occupied territories you know what I found Airbnb listings for condos there yeah apparently is horrible hjortur in place has luxury condominiums where people from other Muslim nations can get an Airbnb want that bad please subscribe to our premium service at www.fortuigence.com we need to have Florida Governor Rick Scott remove incompetent Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel what are the app store download the rebel app thanks for doing all those things hope you all had a great Passover and Easter weekend thanks so much for watching I'll be back with you tomorrow
