well rumors are growing of a key reshuffle in Donald Trump's legal team with American media headlines warning that the president plans to fire the head of the Russia investigation Robert Muller the following two tweets fueled media attention from questions the impartiality of the investigation led by Mueller he also claims that the probe itself is based on quote a fake dossier paid for by Democrat rivals just to remind to you Robert Muller as an investigator leading the probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election his team continues to look for possible connections between Trump and Russia our reporters did manage to ask Trump himself about mullahs potential firing where the president refused to be drawn in Trump didn't tweet about him that whole time even once until this weekend I see no cause when it comes to mr. Muller he needs to be able to do his job independent of any political influence Donald Trump is gearing up to fire Robert Muller if you're innocent act innocent and right now he's looking like you know I want this over because he's got something to hide and that's a mistake we spoke to news commentator Jena Loudon she believes that the Muller issue was simply being driven by the mainstream media because it believes it could lead to Trump's impeachment the topic of Moeller is one of the most perfect examples of where Trump tweets something the media goes into apoplexy over it gets themselves all in a tailspin about it when in fact there's nothing going on there and there's nothing that's going to come of it and the media feeds right into this the media would love to believe that the president would fire Moeller and that this would somehow lead to the president's impeachment because that's exactly what the left wants they are constantly desperately clawing and scraping for some way to get this president out being the media perceives everything that the president does as strictly a prediction of his next policy move they're making a gross error that they've been making for going on a couple of years now and that's why it's not serving the media so well
