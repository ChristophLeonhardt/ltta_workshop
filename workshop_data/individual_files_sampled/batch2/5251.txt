this morning President Clinton is answering questions about sexual harassment and power Clinton and author James Patterson sat down with NBC's Craig Melvin to discuss their newest novel and the discussion turned to the impact of the me2 movement and things got heated few days ago in response to critics who've suggested that you should have resigned and they'll in the wake of the Lewinsky scandal you said that you should not have if you were president now in 2018 with with everything that's that's going on with the me2 movement how would you have approached the accusations differently well I don't think it would be an issue because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts if the facts are the same today I wouldn't in 1998 President Clinton shocked the world first denying then admitting to an affair with in White House intern Monica Lewinsky the scandal launching a lengthy investigation that ended with Clinton becoming just the second president ever to be impeached you're asking well no we have a right to change the rules yes but you don't have a right changes a lot of the facts have been conveniently omitted to make the story work but I think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don't seem to care I think I did the right thing and defended the Constitution you think this president has been given a pass with regards to the the women who have come forward and accused him of sexual Wisconsin well I think no but it hadn't gotten anything like the coverage that you would expect president Trump has been accused by numerous women of inappropriate sexual behavior all of which he denies I like the me2 movement it's way over there I think that it doesn't mean I agree with everything I still have some questions about some of the decisions that have been made this March Monica Lewinsky penned an op-ed in Vanity Fair taking responsibility for her part in the scandal but also admitting that years later she was diagnosed with PTSD from the unrelenting public scrutiny one of the things that this this me to era has done its forced a lot of women to speak out one of those women Monica Lewinsky she wrote an op-ed that the meter movement changed her view of sexual harassment quote he was my boss he was the most powerful man on the planet he was 27 years my senior with enough life experience no better he was at the time at the pinnacle of his career while I was in my first job out of college looking back on what happened then through the lens of me to now do you do you think differently or feel more responsibility no I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it did you ever apologize and know yes and nobody believes that I got out of that for free I left the White House sixteen million dollars in debt but this was litigated 20 years ago two-thirds of the American people sided with me they were not insensitive that I had a sexual harassment policy when I was governor in the eighties I had two women Chiefs of Staff when I was governor women were over-represented in the attorney general's office in the 70s for their percentage in the bar I've had nothing but women leaders in my office since I left you are giving one side and omitting mr. president I'm not I'm not trying to present aside no no you asked me if I agreed the answer is no I don't and I asked if you'd ever apologize and you said you had I have you've apologized I apologized to everybody in the world it is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I feel is genuine first and most important my family Monica Lewinsky and her family but you didn't apologize to her I have not talked to her Apollo I do I I do know I've never talked to her but I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry that's very different the followed he was public and you don't think a private apology sewed I think this thing has been it's 20 years ago come on let's talk about JFK let's talk about you know LBJ stop already I don't think president you think President Kennedy should have resigned do you believe President Johnson should resign no one should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions I dealt with it 20 years ago Plus and the American people two-thirds of them stayed with me and I've tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work that's all I have to say so I just saw the interview that I've always wanted to see with Bill Clinton thanks to Craig Melvin that's the interview I think we've been waiting decades for this abuse of power and then his wife running for president and not facing what happened and the continued abuse that happened under him and the example he set for America's children about what is is so my thanks to Craig Melvin we'll be right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on
