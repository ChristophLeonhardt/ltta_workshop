1
00:00:00,678 --> 00:00:04,748
FOR LETTING BAD ACTORS, LIKE

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:08,686
RUSSIA SLIDE WHILE TAKING SHARP

3
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:14,892
AIM AT SOME OF OUR ALLIES.

4
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:17,795
>> Brett: DENUCLEARIZATION AND A

5
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:21,098
BIG PART OF THAT IS KIM JONG-UN.

6
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:24,468
I TALKED WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN

7
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:29,373
PRESIDENT EARLIER TODAY.

8
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:30,040
YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,609
BEFORE THE SIGNING OF THE NEW

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,811
TRADE AGREEMENT SAID THIS.

11
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:39,583
>> A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS ARE

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,686
HAPPENING WITH SHERMAN KIM OF

13
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:44,555
NORTH KOREA.

14
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:47,191
>> Brett: DO YOU EXPECT A LOT OF

15
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:51,762
POSITIVE THINGS BETWEEN

16
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:52,396
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM?

17
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:54,865
>> THROUGH THE SUMMIT MEETING WE

18
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:57,501
HAD ACHIEVED PROGRESS ON

19
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:01,405
DENUCLEAR SRI --IZATION AND I

20
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:04,108
LOOK FORWARD TO A MEETING WITH

21
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:06,143
KIM AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE

22
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:07,745
NEAR FUTURE.

23
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:08,946
>> Brett: BEFORE THE END OF THE

24
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:09,880
YEAR?

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,718
>> YES, I BELIEVE SO.

26
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:15,186
>> Brett: THERE IS CONCERN IN

27
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:17,588
THE U.S. THAT MAYBE TOO MUCH IS

28
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:23,160
BEING GIVEN UP BEFORE ACTUAL

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,629
DENUCLEARIZATION IS HAPPENING IN

30
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:25,663
NORTH KOREA.

31
00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:27,698
HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT?

32
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:30,401
>> THERE IS A LOT OF SPECULATION

33
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:32,470
IF NORTH KOREA WILL ACTUALLY

34
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,639
KEEP THEIR PROMISE THIS TIME.

35
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,641
HOWEVER, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE

36
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,409
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

37
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:40,211
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN

38
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:42,780
WHAT WE HAVE IN THE PAST.

39
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,649
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY,

40
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:45,449
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

41
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:48,186
STATES AND THE LEADER OF NORTH

42
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:50,388
KOREA FRESH OUT OF A SMUMENT

43
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,457
MEETING AND THEY MADE A PROMISE

44
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:54,659
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE WORLD THAT

45
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,728
IS BINDING AND THEY HAVE A LOT

46
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:59,197
OF RESPONSIBILITY ON THEIR

47
00:01:59,197 --> 00:01:59,564
SHOULDER.

48
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,433
NORTH KOREA CAN ONLY HAVE

49
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:05,770
SANCTIONS RELIEF AFTER

50
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,007
DENUCLEARIZATION IS COMPLETED.

51
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:10,708
AS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE NEEDS

52
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,777
TO SOLVE THE NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR

53
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:16,114
PROBLEM AND THIS IS A PROBLEM

54
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,549
THAT NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO

55
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,985
SOLVE IN THE DECADES PAST.

56
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:23,221
SO, HE WILL HAVE A MAJOR

57
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,556
ACHIEVEMENT.

58
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:25,723
>> Brett: WHAT IS YOUR TOP

59
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:31,963
PRIORITY?

60
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:35,767
>> PEACE AND I HOPE THAT

61
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:39,004
UNIFICATION WILL COME NATURALLY,

62
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:39,337
AS WELL.

63
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,672
>> Brett: WHAT IS YOUR

64
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:41,373
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT

65
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:42,974
TRUMP AND HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

66
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:45,243
IT?

67
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:48,913
>> EVER SINCE MY INAUGURATION

68
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:53,084
LAST MAY, I HAD SEVEN SUMMIT

69
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:53,818
MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

70
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:55,887
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT HAVE

71
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:57,489
BECOME MORE THAN A FRIEND WITH

72
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:58,890
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND BETWEEN THE

73
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,293
TWO OF US, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

74
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:06,164
PER -- PERFECT TRUST.

75
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:08,967
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT

76
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:09,735
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCOMPLISHED

77
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:12,971
IN TERMS OF NORTH KOREA'S

78
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:14,973
DENUCLEARIZATION AND THE CHANGES

79
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,510
IN PLACE FROM NINE MONTHS AND

80
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,946
LAST NOVEMBER AND IF YOU COMPARE

81
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:23,648
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID AT THE

82
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:25,884
UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR.

83
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:29,287
>> ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE

84
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,223
MISSION FOR HIMSELF AND HIS

85
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:33,759
REGIME.

86
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,128
>> AND TODAY.

87
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,529
>> TREMENDOUS PROGRESS HAS BEEN

88
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:39,031
MADE AND I THINK THAT YOU ARE

89
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:41,366
GOING TO SEE AN OUTCOME.

90
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,435
>> EVER SINCE LAST NOVEMBER,

91
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,871
NORTH KOREA HAS NOT ENGAGED IN

92
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:49,107
ANY NUCLEAR TEST OR

93
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:50,442
PROVERYCATIONS OF THIS TIME.

94
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:54,596
AND THEY HAVE DISPANT

95
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:54,847
AND THEY HAVE DISPAN

96
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:54,880
AND THEY HAVE DISMAN

97
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:54,913
AND THEY HAVE DISMANT

98
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:55,647
AND THEY HAVE DISMANTLE

99
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:56,181
AND THEY HAVE DISMANTLED

100
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:56,215
AND THEY HAVE DISMANTLED T

101
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:56,248
AND THEY HAVE DISMANTLED THE

102
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:57,249
AND THEY HAVE DISMANTLED THEIR

103
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:57,916
NUCLEAR TEST SITE.

104
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,053
THIS IS THE ONLY NUCLEAR TEST

105
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:03,355
SITE THEY HAD.

106
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,491
THAT MEANS THEY WON'T HAVE A

107
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:07,126
SITE IN THE FUTURE.

108
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:09,862
AND WITH MY MEETING WITH KIM

109
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:12,731
JONG-UN, HE EXPRESSED HIS

110
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:18,170
WILLINGNESS TO DISMANTLE THE

111
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,839
PLATFORM UNDER AMERICAN EXPERTS.

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,641
THIS MEANS THAT NORTH KOREA WILL

113
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:25,010
NOT BE ABLE TO TEST LONG RANGE

114
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,111
MISSILES AGAIN.

115
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,013
NOW, ALL OF THIS MEANS THAT

116
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:30,749
NORTH KOREA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

117
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:32,351
THREATEN THE UNITED STATES WITH

118
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:38,524
THEIR NUCLEAR MISSILE ARSENAL.

119
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:39,792
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WILLING TO

120
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,027
TAKE ADDITIONAL MEASURES AND ALL

121
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:43,996
OF THIS CHANGE THAT WE ARE

122
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:45,831
WITNESSING RIGHT NOW IS POSSIBLE

123
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:50,336
BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE

124
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:53,939
UNITED STATES HAS THE FIRST EVER

125
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,175
SUMMIT WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH

126
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,544
KOREA IN 70 YEARS OF THEIR

127
00:04:58,544 --> 00:04:59,078
HISTORY.

128
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:01,881
ALL OF MY PRAISE GOES TO

129
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:03,115
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

130
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:05,017
>> Brett: SO YOU GIVE HIM A LOT

131
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:05,918
OF CREDIT?

132
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:07,053
>> YES.

133
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:11,123
>> Brett: YOU HAVE MET WITH KIM

134
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:12,491
JONG-UN MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE IN

135
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,492
THE WORLD.

136
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:16,128
HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

137
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:17,830
HIS SENSIBILITIES?

138
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,498
IS HE SERIOUS?

139
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:23,636
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HE COULD

140
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:26,873
COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZE THE

141
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:28,674
NORTH COMPLETELY OR IS THAT

142
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:30,577
SOMETHING THAT IS THE IDENTIFY

143
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:34,480
OF NORTH KOREA.

144
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,652
>> KIM JONG-UN HAS EXPECTATIONS

145
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:42,555
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SUCH A

146
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:45,525
MAJOR FEAT CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED

147
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,061
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

148
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:52,732
HE WANTS TO ACHIEVE THE

149
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:53,933
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA

150
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,403
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

151
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,973
AND THIS DESIRE ON MANY

152
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:00,874
OCCASIONS TOO.

153
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:02,976
IN ORDER TO MAKE PROGRESS HE

154
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:06,045
WANTS TO HAVE THE SECOND NORTH

155
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:06,946
KOREA SUMMIT AS SOON AS

156
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:08,581
POSSIBLE.

157
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,717
I WOULD SAY THAT KIM JONG-UN IS

158
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,353
YOUNG AND CANDID AND HAS CLEAR

159
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:15,755
COMMITMENTS TO DENUCLEARIZATION

160
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:19,893
AND HE'S READY TO ABANDON HIS

161
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:22,762
NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND FOCUS ON

162
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:25,031
ECONOMIC BENEFITS INSTEAD, IN

163
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,400
ORDER TO HELP HIS PEEP.

164
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,935
-- PEOPLE.

165
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:34,007
HE HAS THIS STRATEGIC MIND.

166
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:38,111
>> Brett: DO YOU THINK THAT FULL

167
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,680
VERIFIABLE DENUCLEARIZATION, THE

168
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,416
GOAL OF 2021, THAT HAS BEEN

169
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:50,924
TALKED ABOUT, IS THAT REALISTIC?

170
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:54,194
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT TO GO IN A

171
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,697
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

172
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:59,500
>> KIM JONG-UN IS WILLING TO

173
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,036
HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL

174
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,538
INSPECTORS INSPECT HIS

175
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:06,473
FACILITIES AND SAID THAT HE'S

176
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:14,348
READY TO PERMANENTLY DISABLE HIS

177
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:16,016
FACILITIES.

178
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:19,553
NOW, IF NORTH KOREA TAKES

179
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:22,856
GENUINE MEASURES IN TERMS OF

180
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:23,991
DISMANTLING THEIR NUCLEAR

181
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:26,260
PROGRAM, IT ALL COMES DOWN IF

182
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,695
THE UNITED STATES IS READY TO

183
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:31,498
PROVIDE CORRESPONDING MEASURES

184
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,067
IN A SWIFT WAY.

185
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,635
THE UNITED STATES PROMISED TO

186
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,537
END HOSTILE RELATIONS WITH NORTH

187
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:39,740
KOREA TO PROVIDE SECURITY

188
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,713
GUARANTEES AND WORK WITH NEW

189
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,648
U.S./KOREA RELATIONS.

190
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:52,486
ALTHOUGH THEY WILL NOT HAPPEN

191
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:53,254
SIMULTANEOUSLY, I BELIEVE THEY

192
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:59,593
NEED TO BE TAKEN IN PAIR HELL.

193
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:04,765
-- PAIR.

194
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:07,701
THIS IS WHY I FEEL IT IS

195
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,071
ACHIEVABLE DURING PRESIDENT

196
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,472
TRUMP'S TERM.

197
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:14,642
>> Brett: DO YOU TRUST KIM

198
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:14,975
JONG-UN?

199
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:18,579
HE DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT TRACK

200
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,381
RECORD OF PROMISING AND

201
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:21,549
DELIVERING ON THINGS.

202
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,984
WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE U.S.

203
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:24,919
ADMINISTRATION IS THEY WOULD

204
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,788
LIKE TO SEE THINGS DONE

205
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:29,457
COMPLETELY AND THEN, PULL THE

206
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,092
SANCTIONS OFF.

207
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:39,433
>> WHEN WE SAY, "COARSE PONDING

208
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,568
MEASURES" WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE

209
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,219
CHANGES

210
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,871
CHANGE

211
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:47,108
CHANGES -- THE CULTURE

212
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,375
CHANGES -- THE CULTUAL

213
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,778
EXCHANGES AND IF SO, WE CAN

214
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:55,750
THINK ABOUT ESTABLISHING A U.S.

215
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,418
LIAISON OFFICE AND BY

216
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:58,552
ESTABLISHING THIS KIND OF

217
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:00,988
OFFICE, WE CAN SHOW THE U.S.

218
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:03,457
COMMITMENT TO END HOSTILE

219
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:07,895
RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA AND

220
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:11,832
LOW GUESTICLY SUPPORT THE

221
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:12,233
ACTIVITIES.

222
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:13,701
AND EXTENDING THE ECONOMIC

223
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,169
RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.

224
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,971
I CAN TELL YOU THERE IS NOTHING

225
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:19,240
TO LOSE FOR US WHEN WE PUT OUR

226
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,374
TRUST IN NORTH KOREA.

227
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:21,876
THE MEASURES THAT NORTH KOREA

228
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:26,881
WILL BE TAKING WILL BE THE

229
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,617
PERMANENT DISMANTLEMENT OF

230
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:32,820
NUCLEAR BASES AND IF THEY ARE

231
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,655
EXISTING AND NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

232
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:38,559
THESE ARE ALL IRREVERSIBLE

233
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
MEASURES.

234
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,330
THE MEASURES THAT THE U.S. WILL

235
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,499
BE TAKING IS THE SUSPENSION OF

236
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:51,172
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES, WHICH

237
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,107
CAN BE RESUMED AT ANY TIME.

238
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:56,944
IF NORTH KOREA GOES BACK ON ITS

239
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,380
PROMISE, WE CAN PUT THESE

240
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,116
SANCTIONS ON AGAIN.

241
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,117
THE UNITED STATES HAS NOTHING TO

242
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:04,819
LOSE.

243
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:09,924
>> Brett: DID YOU IMAGINE SEEING

244
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:11,726
ONE KOREA IN YOUR LIFETIME?

245
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:13,594
>> IT IS HARD TO PREDICT WHEN

246
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:15,596
THAT CAN BE ACHIEVE.

247
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:17,899
WE CANNOT PLAN FOR THIS KIND OF

248
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:18,933
THING.

249
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:25,339
IF WE ESTABLISH COMPLETE PEACE,

250
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,275
WE CAN SEE THAT.

251
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,444
I'M HOPEFUL THAT I WILL SEE IT

252
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:31,279
IN MY LIFETIME.

253
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,081
>> Brett: DO YOU WANT TO SEE

254
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,149
U.S. TROOPS LEAVE SOONER THAN

255
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:36,117
LATER?

256
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:40,655
>> I WOULD SAY NO.

257
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,924
I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE U.S.

258
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:45,960
AND KOREA IS BENEFICIAL FOR THE

259
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,564
DETER RENT FOR NORTH KOREA AND

260
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:51,566
UPHOLDING PEACE AND STABILITY IN

261
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:58,807
THE NORTHEAST ASIAN REGION AS A

262
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:01,209
WHOLE.

263
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,012
EVEN AFTER DENUCLEARIZATION IS

264
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:06,181
ACHIEVED, I CAN SEE THE U.S.

265
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,283
TROOPS REMAIN IN KOREA FOR THE

266
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:21,729
PEACE AND STABILITY OF THE''.

267
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:23,565
I EXPECT THERE ARE GOING TO BE

268
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:26,101
PLENTY OF DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN

269
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,769
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN KIM

270
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:30,438
IN THE UPCOMING SUMMIT.

271
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:34,659
IT IS MY DESIRE TO

272
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:34,776
IT IS MY DESIRE T

273
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:34,809
IT IS MY DESIRE  T

274
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:34,943
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO

275
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:34,976
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO S

276
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:35,009
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO SIG

277
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:35,710
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO SIGN

278
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:35,744
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO SIGN T

279
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:35,777
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO SIGN THI

280
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:35,810
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO SIGN THIS

281
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:35,844
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO SIGN THIS A

282
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:36,978
IT IS MY DESIRE  TO SIGN THIS AS

283
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:42,417
SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT THE

284
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,486
TENSION BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND

285
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:47,222
THE UNITED STATES HAVE ENDED.

286
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,324
>> Brett: I WANT YOU TO ADDRESS

287
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:52,327
SOME OF YOUR CRITICS IN KOREA

288
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:53,295
AND SOME POINTS.

289
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,064
THEY SAY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN

290
00:11:56,064 --> 00:12:02,470
CLUMPING DOWN ON JOURNALISTS AND

291
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,906
MUZZLING FACTORS AND LIMITING

292
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:07,642
FREE SPEECH AND DEMOCRATIC

293
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,211
NORMS.

294
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:11,279
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

295
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,783
>> I CAN TELL YOU OUT OF THE

296
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:17,786
ENTIRE HISTORY HERE, THE FREEDOM

297
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:20,922
OF SPEECH AND PRESS HAVE NEVER

298
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:23,692
BEEN GREATER THAN AT THIS TIME.

299
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:26,127
THE PRESS THAT YOU ARE SEEING IN

300
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:28,797
THE U.S. GOES UNPUNISHED, AS

301
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:30,365
WELL.

302
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:34,069
EVERY WEEKEND YOU CAN SEE IN THE

303
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,805
CROWN PLAZA, WHICH IS RIGHT IN

304
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:40,008
FRONT OF MY OFFICE, THE

305
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:43,245
ASSEMBLIES THAT HEAVILY

306
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:44,646
CRITICIZE ME HAPPEN EVERY

307
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:47,215
WEEKEND.

308
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:49,284
>> Brett: THE THEORY IS THAT YOU

309
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:53,055
ARE TRYING TO LINE THINGS UP AND

310
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,524
NOT TAKING IT OUT OF TEXT BOOKS

311
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,928
AND YOU SAY, IN THE WORDS OF

312
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,629
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THAT'S ALL FAKE

313
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,364
NEWS.

314
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:07,703
>> OUR OBJECTION FOR ASPIRING

315
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,939
FOR UNIFICATION IS THE SAME

316
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,340
ACROSS ALL NATIONS.

317
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,744
AND THE PRESCRIPTION IS THAT WE

318
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:19,015
NEED TO WORK TOWARDS PEACEFUL RE

319
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:19,348
NEED TO WORK TOWARDS PEACEFUL  E

320
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:20,116
REUNIFICATION WITH NORTH KOREA

321
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,283
AND ONE OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES

322
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:22,385
AS A PRESIDENT.

323
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,121
AS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CRITICIZE

324
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:29,058
ME, I CAN TELL YOU, MOST OF

325
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,127
THEM, FROM PAST ADMINISTRATIONS

326
00:13:31,127 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE CALLING REUNIFICATION AS A
