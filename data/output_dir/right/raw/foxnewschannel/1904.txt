1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,020
ASSETS BEFORE.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,389
HOW WAS LAST NIGHT'S STRIKE

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:03,756
DIFFERENT.

4
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:05,024
DAVID LEE?

5
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:07,126
>> YOU MAKE A VERY GOOD POINT.

6
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:09,228
THIS WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST

7
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:10,430
STRIKES IN YEARS.

8
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,931
HOW MUCH SO?

9
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:14,033
THIS WAS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF

10
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,702
MILITARY ISRAELI ACTION WE'VE

11
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:19,038
SEEN IN SYRIA SINCE THE END OF

12
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:21,641
THE YOM KIPPUR WAR IN 1973.

13
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:23,509
ISRAEL RARELY ACKNOWLEDGES ANY

14
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,845
TYPE OF MILITARY ACTION BUT NOW

15
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,714
WE ARE SEEING ISRAELI MILITARY

16
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:29,482
MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR EVENTS

17
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:31,217
OVER THE LAST 12 HOURS.

18
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:33,786
ISRAEL IS SAYING ITS FIGHTER

19
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:36,589
JETS DESTROYED THE IRANIAN

20
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:41,627
ROCKET LAUNCHER THAT IRAN'S

21
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,696
ELITE AL QUD FORCE USED HOURS

22
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,331
EARLIER AND CAUSED SIGNIFICANT

23
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,133
DAMAGE TO THE IRANIAN MILITARY

24
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:52,171
INFRASTRUCTURE IN SYRIA,

25
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,907
SPECIFICALLY HITTING A

26
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:55,842
LOGISTICS HEADQUARTERS,

27
00:00:55,842 --> 00:00:56,943
WAREHOUSE AND A WAR MONITORING

28
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:59,579
GROUP IS SAYING THAT THERE ARE

29
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,748
23 DEAD, 18 OF WHOM ARE

30
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:03,549
FOREIGNERS, THAT IS NON-SYRIANS.

31
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:06,119
AS FOR IRAN, THEY ARE NOT

32
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,887
COMMENTING ON THE ISRAELI

33
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:08,221
ATTACK.

34
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:09,956
SYRIA, THOUGH, SAYING ONE OF

35
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:12,025
ITS OWN RADAR BASES WAS HIT

36
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:14,027
ALONG WITH A WEAPONS DEPOT AND

37
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:15,795
ITS AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM.

38
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:19,499
AT THIS HOUR, BILL, HERE ON THE

39
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:21,267
GOLAN HEIGHTS, THINGS ARE QUIET

40
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:22,568
BUT VERY, VERY TENSE.

41
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:25,438
PEOPLE HERE KNOW THE SITUATION

42
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,073
CAN CHANGE LITERALLY ANY MINUTE.

43
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:29,409
>> Bill: WHAT IS SYRIA'S ROLE

44
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,112
IN IRAN'S ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL?

45
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:35,048
>> WELL, WHAT'S NOTEWORTHY HERE

46
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:38,251
IS THE ISRAELIS SAY IT WAS THE

47
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:39,152
IRANIANS THAT LAUNCHED THIS

48
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:42,688
ATTACK BUT DID SO FROM SYRIAN

49
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:43,156
TERRITORY.

50
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:48,294
PRELIMINARY REPORTS NOW SUGGEST

51
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:49,962
THAT THE REGIME OF ASSAD IS

52
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:52,298
TRYING TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM

53
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:53,699
THE LATEST IRANIAN MILITARY

54
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:54,167
AGGRESSION.

55
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,802
FOX NEWS LEARNED THAT EUROPEAN

56
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:57,804
SOURCES HAVE BEEN TOLD ASSAD

57
00:01:57,804 --> 00:01:58,838
AND SENIOR SYRIAN LEADERS HAD

58
00:01:58,838 --> 00:02:00,106
NO KNOWLEDGE AND DID NOT

59
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:02,909
CONSENT TO THE ATTACK LED BY

60
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,679
THE IRANIAN AL QUD FORCE AND

61
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:07,380
ITS GENERAL.

62
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,850
SOURCES SAY THAT THEIR

63
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,351
COMMANDER USED FURY AND

64
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:16,289
MILITARY RESOURCES IN THE

65
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,325
LATEST ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL

66
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:19,826
WITHOUT DAMASCUS.

67
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:21,527
HE COMES AS A FREE AGENT.

68
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:23,896
THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY

69
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,798
WHATSOEVER TO DAMASCUS.

70
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:28,468
SO THIS SEEMS TO UNDERSCORE

71
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,803
THAT THERE IS A LACK OF

72
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:32,705
AWARENESS ON BEHALF OF THE

73
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:33,973
ASSAD LEADERSHIP ABOUT WHAT THE

74
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:35,274
IRANIANS MAY BE DOING ON THE

75
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:37,844
GROUND IN THEIR VERY OWN

76
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:38,177
COUNTRY.

77
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:39,245
LASTLY, BILL, IT'S WORTH NOTING

78
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:41,114
THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN ISRAEL

79
00:02:41,114 --> 00:02:45,184
HAS SAID IT WILL NOT TOLERATE

80
00:02:45,184 --> 00:00:00,000
ANY IRANIAN MILITARY PRESENCE
