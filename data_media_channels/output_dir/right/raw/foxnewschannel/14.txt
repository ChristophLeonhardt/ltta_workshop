1
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:09,929
>> THE LANGUAGE OF MORAL

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,364
CONDEMNATION AND DISTRACTIVE

3
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:14,366
ROUTINE, THESE ARE ARGUMENTS AND

4
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:16,502
DISAGREEMENTS THAT HAVE TO STOP

5
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:16,769
IT.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,506
NO ONE SHOULD CARELESSLY COMPARE

7
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:21,073
POLITICAL OPPONENTS TO

8
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:23,542
HISTORICAL VILLAINS.

9
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:26,979
WHICH IS DONE OFTEN, IT IS DONE

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,780
ALL THE TIME.

11
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:29,548
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

12
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:30,215
>> Sandra: THAT WAS

13
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:30,883
PRESIDENT TRUMP LAST NIGHT.

14
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:33,018
LET'S GET TO HER HOUSE LATER

15
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:35,854
THIS MORNING, ANTHONY SCARAMUCC

16
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:36,255
SCARAMUCCI.

17
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:37,156
FORMER WHAT HAS COMMUNICATION

18
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:38,657
DIRECTOR, AND AUTHOR OF A

19
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:41,760
BRAND-NEW BOOK, RIGHT AWAY.

20
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:42,695
YOU SPEND A LOT OF YOUR TIME

21
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:43,495
TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND

22
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:45,965
WHERE HE IS COMING FROM ON

23
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:46,298
ISSUES.

24
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:47,833
WHERE IS HE COMING FROM ON THIS

25
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:48,901
PARTICULAR ISSUE?

26
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:50,602
>> I THINK HE WAS GREAT LAST

27
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:51,403
NIGHT.

28
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:52,504
HE IS SENDING THE RIGHT MESSAGE.

29
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:55,741
IT IS A MORE TEMPERATE MESSAGE.

30
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:56,475
TRYING TO DE-ESCALATE THE

31
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:58,744
TENSION THAT IS OUT THERE.

32
00:00:58,745 --> 00:00:59,979
YOU DON'T WANT THE ROUGHNESS OF

33
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,947
THE RHETORIC TURNING INTO

34
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:02,381
VIOLENCE.

35
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:04,550
HE IS THE LEADER OF THE FREE

36
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:04,850
WORLD.

37
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:06,819
A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIM.

38
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,322
AWFULLY HE WILL DIAL DOWN AND TO

39
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:11,357
DE-ESCALATE.

40
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:12,057
>> Sandra: IS HE RESPONSIBLE?

41
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:14,593
>> I THINK WE ALL ARE.

42
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:15,394
ELEMENTS OF THE MEDIA THAT FIRES

43
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:19,598
PEOPLE UP, DEMOCRATS AND

44
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,033
REPUBLICANS, AND CERTAINLY THE

45
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,201
PRESIDENT HAS HIS MOMENTS WHERE

46
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:24,203
HE HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH

47
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:24,803
HIS RHETORIC.

48
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:26,405
KNOWING HIM AS WELL AS I FEEL I

49
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:28,073
KNOW HIM, IT IS USUALLY WHEN

50
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:29,808
SOMEONE IS COMING AFTER HIM.

51
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:31,176
I HAVE NEVER REALLY SEEN HIM GET

52
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:33,379
UP IN THE MORNING AND SAY OKAY,

53
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,180
I AM GOING TO START A VICIOUS

54
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:37,182
ATTACK OF A, B, AND C.

55
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:40,285
USUALLY SOMEONE IS FIRING A

56
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,287
MISSILE INTO HIM.

57
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,356
>> Bill: I'M GOING TO PUT TWO

58
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:44,923
THINGS ON THE SCREEN.

59
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:47,960
JUST REACT TO IT.

60
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:49,762
JEFF STUCKER OF CNN.

61
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:51,363
"THERE WAS A TOTAL AND COMPLETE

62
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:53,732
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IN THE

63
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:54,933
WHITE HOUSE OF THE CONTINUED

64
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,769
ATTACKS ON THE MEDIA.

65
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,037
THE PRESIDENT AND ESPECIALLY THE

66
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:58,937
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY

67
00:01:58,938 --> 00:01:59,938
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR

68
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:00,372
WORDS MATTER.

69
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:04,143
THUS FAR, THEY HAVE SHOWN NO

70
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:06,078
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT.

71
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,147
SARAH SANDERS HAD A VERY STRONG

72
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:08,680
REACTION TO THIS.

73
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:11,417
DONALD TRUMP ASKED AMERICANS TO

74
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:12,684
COME TOGETHER IN A VERY CLEAR,

75
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:17,556
STRONG, AND UNMISTAKABLE STANCE.

76
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:20,192
DO YOU CHOOSE TO ATTACK AND

77
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,193
DIVIDE.

78
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:21,960
SHOULD DIVIDE AGAINST ALL

79
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,729
POLITICAL VIOLENCE.

80
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,597
THOSE WHOSE LIVES ARE NOT GOING

81
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:26,765
TO COME TOGETHER.

82
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:30,736
>> THERE WAS A WAR DECLARATION.

83
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:38,177
THOSE TWO SIDES ARE AT WAR.

84
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:38,877
THE PRESIDENT FEELS JUSTIFIED

85
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:40,946
BECAUSE HE WILL LOOK AT THE

86
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:42,181
HARVARD STUDY.

87
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:44,483
92% OF THE MEDIA IS DECIDEDLY

88
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:44,817
BIASED.

89
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:46,585
THAT IS A HARVARD STUDY.

90
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:48,387
THAT IS NOT SO REPUBLICAN SAYING

91
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:48,654
IT.

92
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,356
SO JUSTIFIABLY, PEOPLE LIKE

93
00:02:51,357 --> 00:02:52,558
SARAH SANDERS FEEL THAT THEY

94
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,392
DON'T GET A FAIR SHAKE.

95
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:58,130
I AM A LITTLE SORE.

96
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:01,033
HE DOES INTENTIONALLY LIE TO

97
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:02,935
CREATE A DOG WHISTLE AND THIS

98
00:03:02,936 --> 00:03:04,002
ATMOSPHERE SO THAT YOU RAISE THE

99
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:06,438
VOLUME ON HIM LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL

100
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,940
PROCTOR.

101
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:10,742
SO THEY GO OUT AND PUT OUT A

102
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:11,610
TAGLINE.

103
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:13,112
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI CALLS THE

104
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:13,612
PRESIDENT A LIAR.

105
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:17,382
THAT IS NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.

106
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:19,017
WHEN WE GET UPSET WITH EACH

107
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:20,853
OTHER, I HAD TO CALL MY WIFE

108
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:21,553
DOWN LAST NIGHT BECAUSE SHE

109
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:24,356
WATCHED A VIDEO OF ME ON THEIR

110
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:24,957
SHOW FOUR TIMES.

111
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,358
I DID NOT SAY THAT HE WAS A

112
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:26,658
LIAR.

113
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,962
I SAID THAT HE IS USING A

114
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:30,696
METHODOLOGY OF THE MINISTRIES TO

115
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:35,501
CREATE THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY.

116
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:37,269
HE IS TRYING TO GALVANIZE HIS

117
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,569
BASE.

118
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,137
IT IS A MEDIA DEVICE.

119
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:41,340
IF YOU READ HIS BOOKS, I READ

120
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:44,610
EVERY SINGLE ONE.

121
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:45,944
ONE OF HIS STRATEGIES IS TO GET

122
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:47,012
THE VOLUME UP ON THE MEDIA.

123
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:50,215
HE HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB IN

124
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:51,383
THE CAMPAIGN AND IN THE

125
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:51,783
PRESIDENCY.

126
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,552
>> Bill: BUT WHEN YOU TALK

127
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:55,854
ABOUT NOT FIRING THE FIRST SHOT,

128
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:59,124
WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW, IS THE

129
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,726
WEST WING ON OFFENSE BASED ON

130
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,795
THE CRITICISM THAT HAS COME FROM

131
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:04,530
NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER

132
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:05,030
AND JOHN BRENNAN?

133
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:09,201
>> LISTEN, I THINK EVERYBODY

134
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:09,935
WOULD BE WELL SERVED IF THERE

135
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,937
WAS ANOTHER PIECE MEETING.

136
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:14,072
I THINK YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS

137
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:15,340
GOING BACK INTO THE TRANSITION.

138
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:17,776
OF COURSE IN DECEMBER.

139
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:21,213
A LOT OF THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVES

140
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:22,681
IN THE AREA DESCENDING ON

141
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:23,081
TRUMP TOWER.

142
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:27,786
HAD A BIG MEETING TO SEE IF WE

143
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,555
COULD WORK ON A PATTERN OF

144
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:30,189
DE-ESCALATION.

145
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,856
IT DIDN'T WORK.

146
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:33,392
BUT NOW WE ARE HERE AT THE

147
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:33,992
BORDERLINE OF VIOLENCE.

148
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:34,826
MAYBE IT IS TIME TO REVISIT THAT

149
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:37,162
IN THE WEST WING.

150
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:38,797
A GROUP OF MEDIA EXECUTIVES GET

151
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:40,799
DOWN THERE TO THE PRESIDENT.

152
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,267
THEY HAVE AN AIRING OUT OF THE

153
00:04:42,268 --> 00:04:43,969
ISSUES.

154
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,538
CLEARLY, REMEMBER WHAT THE

155
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:47,639
PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT THE

156
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,273
KHASHOGGI SITUATION.

157
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,775
HE SAID TO LESLIE STAHL, THE

158
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:51,543
FACT THAT THIS PERSON IS A

159
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:53,078
JOURNALIST, IT MAKES ME EVEN

160
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,745
MORE UPSET.

161
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:54,880
THAT IS TELLING YOU THAT HE

162
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,049
BELIEVES IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT,

163
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,784
HE WANTS THERE TO BE A RIGOROUS

164
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:00,819
DEBATE WITH THE PRESS.

165
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,554
AND OBVIOUSLY, AT TIMES IT WILL

166
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:03,922
BE ADVERSARIAL.

167
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:05,991
IT HAS BEEN FOREVER PRESIDENT OF

168
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,392
EVERY ADMINISTRATION, FRANKLY.

169
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:08,360
LEFT AND RIGHT.

170
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:10,729
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO DIAL IT

171
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,463
DOWN FROM THE WARTIME SITUATION

172
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:12,564
THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW.

173
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,566
THOSE TWO STATEMENTS THAT YOU

174
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:15,801
PUT UP, THAT IS MORE

175
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:16,201
DECLARATION.

176
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:19,338
LET'S CEASE FIRE.

177
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,639
>> Sandra: "A VERY GOOD PART

178
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,574
OF THE ANGER THAT WE SEE TODAY

179
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:24,710
IN OUR SOCIETY IS CALLED BY THE

180
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:28,547
WILL EVOLVE AND INACCURATE

181
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:32,384
REPORTING OF THE MEDIA.

182
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:33,652
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA MUST CLEAN

183
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:34,953
UP ITS ACT FAST.

184
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:37,522
WE ARE NOW 12 DAYS OUT FROM

185
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:38,590
MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

186
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,558
WHERE DO THINGS STAND?

187
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,959
>> IT IS A LOT HIGHER THAN

188
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,393
PEOPLE THINK.

189
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:44,763
IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING DATA,

190
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:46,531
SOME OF THE POLLING DATA THAT WE

191
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:47,899
ARE LOOKING AT YESTERDAY, I LOOK

192
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:56,575
AT CERTAIN POLLS THAT WERE VERY

193
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:57,843
PREDICTABLE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT

194
00:05:57,844 --> 00:05:59,578
SUCCESS, DESPITE PEOPLE LIKE

195
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,081
NATE SILVER SAME DIFFERENTLY.

196
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:03,815
86%.

197
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,183
SAID THAT THE SECRETARY CLINTON

198
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:07,552
WAS GOING TO WIN BY 86%.

199
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:08,353
LITERALLY TWO YEARS EARLIER.

200
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:11,523
BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS BOMB

201
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:12,891
SCARE, THAT THE PERPETRATION OF

202
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:14,159
THE BOMB SCARE HAS GOT SOME OF

203
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,461
THAT MOMENTUM, SOME OF MY

204
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:18,930
GALVANIZING MOMENT WAS TAKING

205
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:20,265
PLACE ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

206
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,200
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO GET OUT THE

207
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:22,501
VOTE.

208
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:23,969
YOU HAVE TO GET THE

209
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,071
PORT-AU-PRINCE PATIENT AFOOT.

210
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:30,542
HAPPY ABOUT THE ECONOMY, THE

211
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:31,576
ONES THAT ARE REALLY UPSET WITH

212
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,178
THE PRESIDENT, THEY HAVE A

213
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,579
TENDENCY TO TURN OUT.

214
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,281
THAT IS WHY MOST PRESIDENTS LOSE

215
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,116
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

216
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:44,389
LOOK, IT IS MORE MOOCH IN ONE

217
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,756
DAY.

218
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:45,991
>> Bill: I THINK WHAT IS

219
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:49,561
INTERESTING ABOUT YOUR BOOK, I

220
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,530
WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO PITCH

221
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:51,897
IT.

222
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:53,165
YOU MADE A LOT OF MONEY.

223
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,534
YOU MAKE THE CASE THAT YOU LOST

224
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:57,135
TOUCH WITH AMERICA.

225
00:06:57,136 --> 00:07:00,105
NOW, HOW DID YOU FIND A WAY TO

226
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:04,176
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING?

227
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:04,710
WEST OF NEW JERSEY?

228
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,212
>> YES, MY DAD WAS A BLUE-COLLAR

229
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:07,879
WORKER.

230
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,184
PUT HIS LUNCH PALED TOGETHER.

231
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:17,389
WE HAD A NICE MIDDLE CLASS

232
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,558
UPBRINGING.

233
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,927
THEN I STARTED TALKING TO MY

234
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:22,527
PEER GROUP.

235
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:25,564
I STARTED GETTING ALL OF THOSE

236
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:26,732
CONFIRMED BIASES OF THE

237
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,400
ESTABLISHMENT AND OF THE ELITE

238
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,736
APPEAR TO JOIN THE TRUMP

239
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,604
CAMPAIGN, ENDED UP IN

240
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:33,205
ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO.

241
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,941
WENT INTO SEE THE PEOPLE THAT

242
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:37,376
WERE TALKING ABOUT SUPPORTING

243
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:38,009
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S, THAT I

244
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,544
REALIZED HE WAS TALKING TO MY

245
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:41,046
FRIENDS AND MY NEIGHBORS, THE

246
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:42,814
ONES HE DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.

247
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:45,917
MY COUSIN BOBBY, WHO IS IN THE

248
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:47,319
AUTO GLASS INDUSTRY.

249
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,553
HE WAS TALKING TO PEOPLE THAT I

250
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:50,222
GREW UP WITH, AND TO THOSE

251
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:50,756
PEOPLE LOVE HIM.

252
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:53,225
THEY FEEL THAT THERE HAS NOT

253
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:55,727
BEEN A VOICE OF ADVOCACY FROM

254
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,162
THE OVAL OFFICE IN THE LAST

255
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:57,729
30-35 YEARS.

256
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,030
AND IF THEY LIKE HIM.

257
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:03,001
SO IF HE SAYS SOMETHING THAT

258
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:05,137
MAYBE NEEDS TO BE FACT-CHECKED,

259
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:06,338
THEY ACTUALLY DON'T CARE.

260
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,640
THEY ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THE

261
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:09,541
POLICIES.

262
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:10,375
THE NUANCES OF HIS PERSONALITY,

263
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:12,544
SO I TRIED TO PUT THAT IN THE

264
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:13,979
BOOK.

265
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,913
I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE

266
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:15,981
PRESIDENTS DATA DATA AND THE

267
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:18,583
PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS A YOUNGER

268
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,718
MAN.

269
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:21,520
PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE TRUMP

270
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:22,120
APARTMENTS.

271
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:24,523
THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT THE

272
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:27,125
25-YEAR-OLD TRUMP IN THE DJT CAR

273
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:28,527
WITH HIS LICENSE PLATE.

274
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:29,961
GOING OVER TO YOU COLLECT COINS

275
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:32,330
OF THE LAUNDRY FACILITY.

276
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:34,366
COLLECTING COINS OUT OF THE

277
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,599
VENDING MACHINE.

278
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,301
AND ALSO LETTING PEOPLE SLIDE

279
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:37,936
ONCE IN A WHILE ON RENT WHEN

280
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:39,538
THEY WERE HAVING TOUGH TIMES IN

281
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:39,971
THEIR LIVES.

282
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:43,341
SO THE PRESIDENT BROUGHT ALL OF

283
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:44,042
THAT, ALL OF THAT BLUE-COLLAR

284
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:46,578
INTERACTION, ALL OF THAT

285
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:47,846
BLUE-COLLAR INTERACTION WITH

286
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,448
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS INTO THE

287
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:50,382
GAME OF POLITICS.

288
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:53,151
HERE'S WHAT HE DID, GUYS.

289
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:54,886
HE TOOK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S

290
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:56,121
MANTLE OF LEADERSHIP WITH THE

291
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:57,923
NOMINATION, AND THEN HE STOLE A

292
00:08:57,924 --> 00:08:58,957
BASE OF THE OTHER PARTY.

293
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,493
HE BROUGHT IT OVER TO THE

294
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:02,327
REPUBLICANS.

295
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:04,129
WHILE THEY WERE FOCUSED ON

296
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,064
SOCIAL ISSUES AND POLITICAL

297
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:08,200
CORRECTNESS --

298
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,167
>> Bill: ECONOMIC DESPERATION.

299
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:12,370
>> EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A GOLDEN

300
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:13,572
TOILET SEAT, THE BLUE-COLLAR

301
00:09:13,573 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE LOVE HIM.
