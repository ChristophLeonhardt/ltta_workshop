1
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,240
>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,476
REPORT.

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,345
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:12,712
STEPHANOPOULOS.

5
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:13,279
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,747
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR RIGHT 

7
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:15,481
NOW BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

8
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,949
ABOUT TO APPEAR ON THE SOUTH 

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,051
LUNE OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

10
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,185
YOU SEE IT SURROUNDED BY 

11
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,653
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

12
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,055
TO CELEBRATE THE PASSAGE OF 

13
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:25,225
THEIR MASSIVE $1.5 TRILLION TAX 

14
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:25,658
PLAN.

15
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,193
THE LARGEST OVERHAUL IN A 

16
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:27,894
GENERATION.

17
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,829
BRINGS THE CORPORATE TAX RATE 

18
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:32,799
DOWN PERMANENTLY FROM 35% TO 

19
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,466
21%.

20
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,834
TEMPORARY CUTS ON INDIVIDUAL TAX

21
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,936
RATES INCLUDING THE TOP RATE 

22
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,339
FROM 39.6% TO 37%.

23
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,474
PAYS IT IN PART BY DOING AWAY 

24
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,576
WITH SEVERAL DEDUCTIONS 

25
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,744
INCLUDING THE STATE AND LOCAL 

26
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:45,979
PROPERTY TAX.

27
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,381
THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION 

28
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,152
IS CAPPED AT $750, DOWN FROM $1 

29
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:52,385
MILLION.

30
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,519
BEYOND THAT, IT GIVES A BENEFIT 

31
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,054
TO THE WEALTHY.

32
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,789
THE ESTATE AND GIFT TAX 

33
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,925
EXEMPTION IS DOUBLED FROM $5.6 

34
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,360
MILLION TO OVER $11 MILLION A 

35
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,593
PERSON.

36
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,229
AND IT ELIMINATES THAT OBAMACARE

37
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:19,846
MANDATE TO BUY HEALTH 

38
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,017
TEST.

39
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,218
TEST.

40
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:19,759
TEST.

41
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,428
WILL SEE AN INCOME TAX CUT OF 

42
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,830
MORE THAN $2,000.

43
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,631
THEY'LL HAVE $2,000, AND THAT'S,

44
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,166
IN MY OPINION, GOING TO BE LESS 

45
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:27,700
THAN THE AVERAGE.

46
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,267
YOU'LL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN 

47
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:31,804
THAT.

48
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,306
ONE THING VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

49
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,741
FARMERS, THE GREAT FARMERS AND 

50
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,275
THE GREAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS 

51
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,711
THAT WERE FORCED TO SELL THEIR 

52
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,047
BUSINESSES AT BARGAIN BASEMENT 

53
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:41,280
NUMBERS.

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,418
WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR THE MOST 

55
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,019
PART ESTATE TAX IS WIPED OUT SO 

56
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,955
THEY CAN KEEP THEIR FARMS IN THE

57
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,188
FAMILY.

58
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,022
THAT TO ME IS A VERY BIG FACTOR.

59
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:53,826
VERY BIG.

60
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,728
THIS IS -- THIS IS GOING TO MEAN

61
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,064
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BE COMING

62
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:58,264
BACK.

63
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,366
I CAMPAIGNED ON THE FACT THAT 

64
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,201
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE OUR 

65
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:02,702
COMPANIES ANYMORE.

66
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,903
THEY'RE GOING TO STAY IN OUR 

67
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,304
COUNTRY AND THEY'RE GOING TO 

68
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,205
STAY IN OUR COUNTRY.

69
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,840
YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT'S 

70
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,043
HAPPENING EVEN AT THIS PROSPECT,

71
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,278
BUT THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS 

72
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,312
ENTHUSIASM RIGHT NOW IN OUR 

73
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,547
COUNTRY AND WE HAVE COMPANIES 

74
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,582
POURING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRIES.

75
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,785
THAT MEANS JOBS AND REALLY THE 

76
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,420
FORMATION OF NEW, YOUNG, 

77
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,355
BEAUTIFUL, STRONG COMPANIES.

78
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,056
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY 

79
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:24,323
IMPORTANT.

80
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:27,026
THE PASSTHROUGHS YOU KNOW ALL 

81
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,594
ABOUT AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES 

82
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,730
ARE GOING TO BE BIG 

83
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,063
BENEFICIARIES.

84
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,665
WE'RE GOING TO BRING AT LEAST $4

85
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,134
TRILLION BACK IN THE COUNTRY, 

86
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,302
MONEY THAT WAS FROZEN OVERSEAS 

87
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,104
AND PARTS OF THE WORLD, SOME OF 

88
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,639
US DON'T EVEN LIKE US AND THEY 

89
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,740
HAD THE MONEY.

90
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,175
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE 

91
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:42,675
MONEY LONG.

92
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,812
SO IT'S REALLY, I GUESS IT'S 

93
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,979
VERY SIMPLE.

94
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,581
WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVEN'T HEARD

95
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,952
THIS EXPRESSION, BUT WE ARE 

96
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:53,986
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

97
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:54,586
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT, HAVE 

98
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:59,091
YOU?

99
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,093
I WANT TO -- I WANT TO HAVE THEM

100
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,129
GET UP AND GET THE GLAMOUR AND 

101
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,664
GLORY, AND I JUST WANT TO HAVE A

102
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,998
FEW COME UP AND THEY'LL SPEAK 

103
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,667
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

104
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,901
THE SHORTER THE BETTER.

105
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,136
THAT WAY WE CAN GET ALL OF YOU.

106
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,139
WE'LL GET EVERYBODY UP, RIGHT?

107
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,374
BUT I WANT TO THANK MITCH 

108
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:15,808
McCONNELL.

109
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,609
I WANT TO THANK -- WHAT A JOB.

110
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:20,813
WHAT A JOB.

111
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,783
I WANT TO THANK PAUL.

112
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,484
THEY'RE GOING TO SPEAK.

113
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,018
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY A FEW 

114
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:26,251
WORDS.

115
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:27,920
PAUL RYAN AND MITCH, IT WAS A 

116
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,654
LITTLE TEAM.

117
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,922
WE JUST GOT TOGETHER AND WE 

118
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,524
WOULD WORK VERY HARD, DIDN'T WE?

119
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,526
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS A LOT OF 

120
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:33,759
FUN.

121
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,628
ALWAYS A LOT OF FUN WHEN YOU 

122
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:35,828
WIN.

123
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,330
IF YOU WORK HARD AND LOSE, 

124
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,297
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

125
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,699
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO NAME A FEW

126
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,167
NAMES AND THEN SOME OF THEM WILL

127
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:41,868
COME UP.

128
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,736
BUT PEOPLE THAT I SAW SO MUCH 

129
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,671
OVER THE LAST MONTH AND REALLY 

130
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,139
OVER THE LAST ALMOST YEAR.

131
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,941
BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK OF IT, WE

132
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,176
HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN A YEAR.

133
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,178
AND WE DID THE LARGEST TAX CUT 

134
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,113
IN OUR HISTORY.

135
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,283
I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT WE 

136
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,518
ESSENTIALLY REPEALED OBAMACARE 

137
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,052
BOSS WE GOT RID OF THE 

138
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:00,953
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WHICH WAS 

139
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,189
TERRIBLE.

140
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,458
AND THAT WAS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF

141
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,594
FUNDING OF OBAMACARE.

142
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,931
AND ANWAR, A FRIEND OF MINE, OH,

143
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,298
CONGRATULATIONS.

144
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:12,531
AND DAN.

145
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,369
WHERE'S DAN?

146
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:16,702
AND DON, TOO.

147
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:23,376
WHERE'S DAN?

148
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,311
>> I'LL TELL YOU, BETWEEN DAN 

149
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,314
AND DON AND LISA, YOU'VE DONE A 

150
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,181
VERY GREAT JOB.

151
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,951
SO A FRIEND OF MINE CALLED UP 

152
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,019
ABOUT ANWAR.

153
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,787
HE SAID YOU DIDN'T GET ANWAR.

154
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,422
I SAID TELL ME ABOUT ANWAR.

155
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,657
HE SAID WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 

156
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,258
GET THAT PASSED, THE WHOLE 

157
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,127
COUNTRY, THE WORLD, THEY TRIED 

158
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,061
IN RONALD REAGAN.

159
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,696
THEY TRIED WITH THE BUSHES.

160
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,398
THEY TRIED WITH EVERYBODY.

161
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,500
THEY NEVER GOT ANWAR, BUT WE GOT

162
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,534
IT IN THE BILL.

163
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,368
WE HAVE MANDATE.

164
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,736
AND WE HAVE THE TAX CUT.

165
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,271
AND WE HAVE THE REFORM.

166
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,839
WHEN YOU ADD UP THE SIZE OF THIS

167
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,007
BILL, IT'S REALLY GREAT.

168
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,311
SO LISA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

169
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:58,844
LISA MURKOWSKI.

170
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,513
SO JOHN CORNYN, THE GREAT 

171
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:04,717
CHAIRMAN ORRIN HATCH.

172
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,252
GREAT JOB.

173
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,386
WOW.

174
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,322
ORRIN IS A SPECIAL PERSON.

175
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,324
TIM SCOTT, WHO HAS BEEN SO 

176
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:11,657
INCREDIBLE.

177
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,458
HE'S GOING TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

178
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:19,832
WHERE IS TIM?

179
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,499
YOU PICK IT UP.

180
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:25,738
HE'S YOUNGER THAN I AM.

181
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,974
I HAVE IT MOSTLY MEMORIZED.

182
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,376
BUT TIM SCOTT HAS BEEN GREAT.

183
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:30,676
JOHN THUNE.

184
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,946
WHERE'S JOHN?

185
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,749
JOHN, GREAT JOB, JOHN.

186
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,517
ROB PORTMAN, A REAL STUDENT OF 

187
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:39,017
THE TAX WORLD.

188
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:44,056

WE HAD FUN.

213
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,671
DID WE HAVE A GOOD TIME?

214
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,772
STEVE SCALISE.

215
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,405
HE'S BRAVER THAN ALL OF US.

216
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,808
HE'S BRAVER.

217
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,679
WHERE IS HE?

218
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:39,912
OH, BOY.

219
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:48,954
I DON'T KNOW.

220
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:49,955
NOT A GOOD WAY.

221
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,257
WE LOVE YOU, STEVE.

222
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:51,524
GREAT JOB.

223
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,826
GREAT JOB.

224
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,126
KEVIN BRADY.

225
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,363
KEVIN.

226
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,898
KEVIN BRADY.

227
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,834
SO MAYBE WHAT I'LL DO IS, AND BY

228
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,903
THE WAY, I MENTIONED AT&T, BUT 

229
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,471
MANY COMPANIES HAVE COME FORWARD

230
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,939
SAYING THEY'RE SO HAPPY AND 

231
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,607
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SIMILAR 

232
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:08,940
ANNOUNCEMENTS.

233
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,076
WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING 

234
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,410
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY SPECIAL.

235
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,545
WE'RE BRINGING THE ENTREPRENEUR 

236
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,213
BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY.

237
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,781
WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL THE 

238
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,183
KNOTS AND TIES AND YOU'RE GOING 

239
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,984
TO SEE.

240
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:19,719
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT 

241
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,020
HAPPENS.

242
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,722
ULTIMATELY WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

243
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,924
IT MEANS JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.

244
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,225
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY A 

245
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,193
SPECIAL PERIOD OF TIME.

246
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,828
WE'RE IN A SPEC PERIOD OF TIME.

247
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,129
IT'S GOING TO BE MORE SO.

248
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,964
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY BEHIND

249
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,298
ME.

250
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,633
MAYBE I COULD START WITH MITCH 

251
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,001
AND THEN PAUL AND A FEW OF THE 

252
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,369
FOLKS COME UP TO SAY A FEW WORDS

253
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,938
AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

254
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:39,205
THANK YOU.

255
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:44,410
MITCH, HOW ABOUT YOU START IT?

256
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,579
>> AND WITH THAT, A BUOYANT 

257
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,115
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT THERE, 

258
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,082
CELEBRATING THE PASSAGE OF WHAT 

259
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,984
HE CALLS THE LARGEST TAX BILL IN

260
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,685
AMERICAN HISTORY.

261
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,954
THAT'S NOT TRUE, THE 18th 

262
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,555
LARGEST IN THE LAST CENTURY, 

263
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,057
ABOUT 1% OF GDP.

264
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,025
NO QUESTION, THIS IS A MAJOR 

265
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,694
LEGISLATIVE VICTORY FOR 

266
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,995
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 

267
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,295
REPUBLICANS.

268
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,530
YOU SEE MITCH McCONNELL RIGHT 

269
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:04,763
THERE.

270
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:07,533
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR 

271
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,400
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT AS 

272
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,002
HE SPEAKED, AND MARY, THE 

273
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,003
PRESIDENT HAS HAD A ROUGH 

274
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,104
RELATIONSHIP WITH REPUBLICAN 

275
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,072
LEADERS OVER THE LAST YEAR.

276
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,740
THEY REALLY DIDN'T SUPPORT HIM 

277
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,242
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

278
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,977
BUT THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY A 

279
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,345
MAJOR TAX CUT, ONE OF THEIR 

280
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,646
MAJOR GOALS, BUT AS THE 

281
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,617
PRESIDENT SAID, IT OPENS UP THE 

282
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,719
ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE 

283
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,020
TO DRILLING AND THEY GOT AT 

284
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,588
LEAST A PIECE OF THE REPEAL OF 

285
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:29,855
OBAMACARE.

286
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,624
>> NO SIGNS OF THAT FRAUGHT 

287
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,157
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 

288
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:33,359
PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS

289
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:33,592
THERE.

290
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,727
AS THE PRESIDENT DID MENTION, 

291
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,961
IT'S ALWAYS A LOT OF FUN WHEN 

292
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:36,395
YOU WIN.

293
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,797
AND THIS IS A BIG SUBSTANTIAL 

294
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:39,899
WIN HERE FOR REPUBLICANS.

295
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,667
THE FIRST MAJOR LEGISLATIVE 

296
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,435
VICTORY OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

297
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,471
AND LOOK, IT DELIVERS IN SOME 

298
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,640
WAYS ON WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN 

299
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:47,907
PROMISING.

300
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,408
MOST AMERICANS WILL SEE A TAX 

301
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,143
CUT AT FIRST.

302
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,678
THEY WERE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF 

303
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,847
WITH NEARLY UNANIMOUS REPUBLICAN

304
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:55,915
SUPPORT HERE.

305
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,118
NO REPUBLICAN NO VOTES IN THE 

306
00:11:59,118 --> 00:11:59,351
SENATE.

307
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,152
BUT GEORGE, NOW THE CHALLENGE IS

308
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,187
TRANSLATING THIS INTO A 

309
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,188
POLITICAL WIN.

310
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,556
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO GET OUT 

311
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,757
THERE AND SELL THIS BILL.

312
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,659
IT'S DEEPLY UNPOPULAR.

313
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,759
CRITICS ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER 

314
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,295
IT WILL DO WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE 

315
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,930
PROMISING IT WILL DO IN THE LONG

316
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,130
TERM.

317
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,332
OF COURSE, IT'S GOING TO PUT A 

318
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,900
MAJOR DENT IN THE DEFICIT.

319
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,701
REPUBLICANS KNOW IF THEY WANT 

320
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,437
THIS TO HELP THEM IN THE 2018 

321
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,872
MIDDERMS, THEY HAVE TO FIX THEIR

322
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,639
MESSAGING ON THIS ONE.

323
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,574
GET THE MESSAGE OUT.

324
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,375
IN FACT, I ASKED THE SPEAKER OF 

325
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,476
THE HOUSE THAT EXACT QUESTION, 

326
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,645
IF HE HAS CONCERNS THAT THIS 

327
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,714
WON'T ULTIMATELY BE VIEWED AS A 

328
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:28,948
WIN.

329
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,449
HE SAID NO, HE TOLD ME THE 

330
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,617
RESULTS ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS 

331
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,218
BILL POPULAR.

332
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,019
>> LET'S LISTEN TO THE SPEAKER 

333
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,587
RIGHT NOW.

334
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,455
>> FOR WHAT THEY DID IN GETTING 

335
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,725
US HERE.

336
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,261
I WANT TO THANK MY PARTNER MITCH

337
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,262
McCONNELL OVER IN THE SMAT FOR 

338
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,396
GETTING US TO WHERE THEY ARE, 

339
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,066
AND I WANT TO THANK ORRIN HATCH 

340
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,234
AND KEVIN BRADY.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 

342
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:54,673
LEADERSHIP ON THIS.

343
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,242
IT IS REALLY SIMPLE.

344
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,977
THE MESSAGE TO THE HARD WORKING 

345
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,279
TAXPAYERS OF AMERICA IS YOUR TAX

346
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,747
RELIEF IS ON ITS WAY.

347
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,215
THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

348
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,150
THE MESSAGE TO THE FAMILIES IN 

349
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,152
AMERICA WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING

350
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,054
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, YOUR TAX 

351
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,858
RATES ARE GOING DOWN AND YOUR 

352
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,360
PAYCHECKS ARE GOING UP.

353
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,695
THIS IS THE KIND OF RELIEF 

354
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,497
AMERICANS DESERVE, THE KIND OF 

355
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,865
TAX CUTS THAT GET OUR ECONOMY 

356
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,433
GOING TO REACH ITS POTENTIAL.

357
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,135
THIS GETS US BETTER WAGES, 

358
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,939
BIGGER PAYCHECKS, A SIMPLER TAX 

359
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:27,172
SYSTEM.

360
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,208
THIS GETS THE AMERICAN ECONOMY 

361
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,310
COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL 

362
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:31,543
ECONOMY.

363
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:32,511
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST 

364
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,046
IMPORTANT THINGS WE COULD DO FOR

365
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,682
ALL OF THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT.

366
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,650
THIS IS GENERATIONAL.

367
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,786

00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,290

IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE 

440
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,715
THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN.

441
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,284
WE HAVE BEEN DEFENDING OUR 

442
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,986
BORDERS, UPHOLDING THE RULE OF 

443
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:54,286

444
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,354
ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ON OUR 

445
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,722
SOUTHERN BORDER ARE DOWN BY MORE

446
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,490

EARLIER TODAY, OUR NATO ALLIES 

454

ARE PAYING MORE TOWARD THEIR 

455
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,937
COMMON DEFENSE.

456
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,305
NORTH KOREA IS MORE ISOLATED 

457
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,706
THAN EVER BEFORE.

458
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,542
THIS PRESIDENT'S PUT IRAN ON 

459
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,343
NOTICE, AND PUT THE WAR ON 

460
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,012
AFGHANISTAN ON A PATH TO 

461
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:20,245
VICTORY.

462
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,580
AND THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF 

463
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,182
THIS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, AND THE

464
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,250
COURAGE OF OUR ARMED FORCES, 

465
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,319
ISIS IS ON THE RUN.

466
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,887
THEIR CAPITAL HAS FALLEN.

467
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,689
AND THEIR SO-CALLED CALIPHATE 

468
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,357
HAS CRUMBLED ACROSS SYRIA AND 

469
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:37,463
IRAQ.

470
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,898
BUT WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY IS

471
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,533
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO KNOWS 

472
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,901
THAT AMERICAN STRENGTH STARTS 

473
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,137
WITH A GROWING AMERICAN ECONOMY.

474
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,739
AND FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS 

475
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:48,974
ADMINISTRATION, THIS PRESIDENT 

476
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,375
CHAMPIONED FREE AND FAIR TRADE.

477
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,878
HE ROLLED BACK FEDERAL RED TAPE 

478
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:53,645
AT RECORD LEVELS.

479
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,481
WE HAVE UNLEASHED AMERICAN 

480
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:55,848
ENERGY.

481
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,950
AND TODAY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 

482
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,384
HAVE FULFILLED THE PROMISE YOU 

483
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,353
MADE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS 

484
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,354
STRUGGLING IN THIS ECONOMY, TO 

485
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,789
CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD.

486
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,424
FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND 

487
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,092
BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL.

488
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,292
IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR, THE 

489
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,595
PRESIDENT LAID OUT HIS VISION 

490
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,231
FOR A TAX CUT THAT WOULD BE A 

491
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,031
MIDDLE-CLASS MIRACLE.

492
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,665
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE 

493
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:23,407
CONGRESS PASSED TODAY.

494
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:24,910
THIS IS GOING TO PUT MORE MONEY 

495
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,279
IN THE POCK LTS OF THE AMERICAN 

496
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:27,512
PEOPLE.

497
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,181
IT WILL MAKE OUR TAX CODE MORE 

498
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,116
SIMPLE, MORE FAIR, MORE EASY TO 

499
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:31,416
UNDERSTAND.

500
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,285
IT WILL MAKEBEDSES ACROSS 

501
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,255
AMERICA MORE COMPETITIVE TO 

502
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,289
CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND 

503
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,290
RAISE WAGES.

504
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,426
I SERVE WITH HIM EVERY DAY.

505
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,362

WE MADE HISTORY TODAY.

513
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,380
BUT AS THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN 

514
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,148
