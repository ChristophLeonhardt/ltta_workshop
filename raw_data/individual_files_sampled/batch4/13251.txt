hey everyone I'm Alicia Kraus with your top five articles of 2017 from The Daily wire let's kick it off with number five in which a CBS executive lost it in a Facebook rant following the October massacre at a Country Music Festival in Las Vegas we have writer Emily zanotti with us can you tell us more Emily sure in just less than 24 hours after the massacre in Las Vegas Haley gelfman Gould who was a legal analyst with CBS got on Facebook and decided to say that she didn't feel sorry for the people who died in that massacre or who were injured because they were mostly Republicans judging by the fact that they were country music fans and of course if anyone deserves to be shot it's Republicans Haley was forced to take that post down and CBS actually had to apologize for it and she no longer has a job and what was the public's immediate reaction most people were just horrified by it in fact it stemmed both sides of the parties both Republicans and Democrats said it was completely unacceptable thanks for your time Emily and congrats on being at our top five thank you that brings us to number four black lives matters list of ten demands for white people and shocker they're insane Amanda presto Giacomo breaks down the list oh yeah we have Chanel helm she's a co-founder of a black lives matter chapter in Louisville Kentucky and she basically compiled a list of things white people should do demands white people should do to heal racial injustice on that list we have white people who are basically giving up all their inheritance their wealth to black and brown families only they don't have to be poor they just have to have black or brown skin and then another great one on the list is get white racists fired quote sheet liske Landman so basically if someone you assume is racist make sure you get them fired you can also use violence that's what she advocates for and apparently this is going to help relieve racial tensions in America Wow thanks for that recap Amanda thanks on to number three the gold star Widow controversy covered by The Daily wires Ryan Saavedra who's on the line to tell us more thanks for joining us Ryan thanks for having me in October a Florida congresswoman Frederika Wilson had made and created kind of national controversy claiming that Trump was rude on the phone to a Goldstar Widow and shortly after she made those comments which went back and forth in the media for a couple of days between her and the president a Goldstar Widow came forward and released a video of her comments or the comments that President Trump made towards her when he called her and it showed to be the exact opposite of everything that Frederica Wilson claimed that Trump was too you know gold star families that show that he was caring nice and highly respectful towards the families thanks Ryan number two is Ben Shapiro's takedown of Democrats for refusing to remain standing for a Navy SEALs Widow during President Trump's speech to Congress in February Ben's here to tell us more hey Ben can you fill us in sure Alicia so here's the story president Trump is giving what's basically a State of the Union address and he's paying homage to Ryan Owens a fallen Navy SEAL first soldier killed under President Trump and Ryan Owens his wife Karen Owens is there in the audience so Trump starts applauding her and everybody gets up and starts applauding and then the Democrats sit down all the we Democrats sit down they won't stand for basically a forum in innovation for the widow of a fallen Navy SEAL showing that the Democrats are more interested in avoiding a photo op for President Trump then even in paying homage to a war hero and his widow a lot of people were angry and they had a right to me thanks Ben that brings us to number one football Sunday being ruined by none other than the National Football League joining us is the Daily wires Joseph curl to summarize the kneeling controversy hey Joseph hey Lisa how are you well it all started in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick took a knee during a preseason game it really didn't catch on then but in 2017 week two it caught on he did it again he started talking about it other players began doing it then of course what really what the fuse was Donald Trump came in and said all you guys should be fired he's used to saying that from The Apprentice so he said you're all fired and of course the very next week 200 players took a knee and and I just it just spiraled from there out of control and what was America's reaction well I think I think a lot of people were rightly furious because it was geared around taking at me during the national anthem it became what a lot of people thought was was a real rejection and protest against America itself again one of the times they did it the the think it was the third week they did it was was the next day was Veterans Day and a lot of Americans really took offense to that so it got out of hand and once Trump injected a lot of politics into it really took over and and it has again spurred this this real down flow of traffic to two NFL games nobody's going because there's a lot of people that are just upset about that thanks for that recap Joseph and congrats on having the number one story this year thanks a lot appreciate it and thank you for watching this recap of the top five daily wire stories from 2017 have a happy new year
