all right let me explain what's going on
here so a couple weeks here on the vlog
I said that I hadn't traveled alone with
Owen
since Francine was born which is true
then Turkish Airlines called
and they're like hey why don't we fly
you somewhere and you can spend some
time with Owen I was like that's a great
idea but I don't have any free time so
old and I are literally going to
Istanbul for the weekend

whole thing that's what we're doing
we're flying to Turkey
we're leaving lounge now we're going to
board we both put on our pajamas
check out my sweatpants they're my
favorite our hands yeah because we
booked our flights like super
last-minute phone and I are not sitting
together and I told the flight attendant
that Owen will cry hysterically if he
doesn't sit next to me and she's doing
an amazing job getting him a seat next
