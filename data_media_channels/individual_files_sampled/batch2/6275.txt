I have an amazing guest for you guys privilege i appalled congresswoman from Washington's seventh district is in the studio she's in rebel headquarters so great to have you it's great to be here all right so now you've got a thousand amazing things that you've done and I and I don't say that lightly and and and the congresswoman is also on the three just Democrats already in Congress which is great and you're going and helping other progressives throughout the country wouldn't talk about that a little bit but I was so excited about what you found it which is the Medicare for all pack yeah okay now there's two different things there's the caucus which you're the co-chair of in Congress and then there's the PAC right let's talk about the PAC first what's what what's the point of the pack well the the PAC actually came second but we'll talk about it first yeah it is really to say that we have a movement across a country of people who want Medicare for all in all these different states and we have candidates now who are running boldly on a medicare-for-all platform and we thought why not form a PAC to really support those candidates who are ready to take this on who are running on this message who are excited about being the conveyors of this excellent policy and so we just started it grassroots all small donations and the very first email we sent out did really really well so we're slowly building that list it's passed Medicare for all org for anybody who wants to go there and the idea is that we will build the power of progressives who are running on a medicare-for-all platform help support them help do research in some cases in their districts really do whatever we can to support their candidacy and we'll put that link down below if you're watching this later on YouTube or Facebook and so conservative worried about this pack and people like Susan Collins say well you can't raise on a single issue that's not fair when she takes 21 million dollars from corporations that's apparently fair okay but so how do you answer those charges well you know what I think is funny the president wrote this article right on USA Today saying it was all about Medicare for all and how much money it's going to cost and I thought doesn't he have anything better to do with his time he must be doing this because he's afraid he knows this is a good policy and frankly the whole issue about cost we have to look at what our current health care system is costing us and over the next 10 years it will cost us thirty two billion dollars more by within the next ten years than what passing medicare for all would cost ultimately this is the system that every industrialized country in the world has depends on and we in the United States need to pass a Medicare for all type system so we're in the process of doing that no they're definitely nervous they're nervous about the the proposal otherwise as you say so only op-ed he wrote and the second thing is that they are they're nervous of the pact might work because raising money for the four cause that people believe in they're like wait were the ones allowed to raise money from corporate interests you guys are not allowed to raise money from real people yeah wrong we that you are so let's talk about the caucus that was first you're the co-chair of it how many people know Medicare for all Congress seventy eight now we had I think 77 founding and then one added on but the reason for starting that was really to say look we need to do some work within the Democratic caucus to get everybody the information they want to get the research out there to really do the work internally to help bring people around to how a policy like this may work and get them the information that they need so that they can be comfortable we're getting ready we're drafting a bill that should you know we're working off of Bernie's Medicare for all bill from the Senate but we're gonna make a few changes to that as well and just sort of take into account some feedback that's out there and our goal is to reintroduce it as six seven six right at the beginning of the next session and then work to get some hearings on it assuming we take back the house and really continue to push it and make sure that I mean I really believe this is going to be one of the defining issues of the 2020 presidential campaign yeah congressman that leads us to an uncomfortable question okay because you've got so many people who are in favor of it but obviously a lot of Democrats did not sign on and you all might have the majority in about three weeks and so if you do and you will Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats even allow vote on it well I think you know I've talked to Jim McGovern who would be chair of rules and I think that we will be able to move the policy along do I think that we will be able to pass it I don't know it depends on what kind of a majority we have it depends on how big we win it depends on what happens in the Senate you know I think Democrats will be nervous to take a vote on it if they know it's never gonna pass the Senate so I think all of that we just have to look and see but I feel pretty confident that if we take back the house that we will be able to do some significant work on moving it forward I really do congresswomen make them vote make them vote if they don't vote then it doesn't mean anything okay so I you know again I think it's all about can we that's why we're setting up this whole infrastructure that's why we're trying to make sure that we get the information to people that they need we to be fair the people that didn't sign on we didn't necessarily ask everybody we wanted to have originally actually we wanted to have 25 original founding members of the caucus and we got that like that so then we said okay let's move it up to 50 okay let's move it up to 75 so I think we can do a little bit more work and we can get you know at least hopefully at least the hundred and seventeen that were on 676 but then the goal really is with this new class coming in do we have enough people I mean just imagine that there are something like I think it's 20% of the red to blue candidates who are supporting Medicare for all you know we have veterans who are not necessarily with us on some other policies but they've always had government provided health care they for them it's a it's a no-brainer so I'm really hopeful that we can get enough to move it through a committee and let's get it to the floor let's have a debate on it let's vote on it and we'll see where we go one way to find out if they're on board um you have an ask one way to ask is to vote on it and then we'll find out well and not just Republicans but Democrats so they should not be afraid of their positions whatever their positions are well and listeners who are out there I think this is an important thing to take to your member of Congress and say we want you join the caucus we want you to you know help push this forward I mean I think that that's this is something that all of us are gonna have to do it's gonna take everybody it's a big it's a big it's a big move it's a big ambitious program and that's what I think we should be thinkin abysus so if speaking of caucuses you're in the Progressive Caucus but the Progressive Caucus is a little broad let's say okay there are some people who are brag about how they're also in moderate caucuses and pro-business caucuses nothing wrong with being pro-business unless you're taking a lot of corporate money and then you're pro-business for other reasons so is there a possibility of a justice Democratic caucus or a caucus of people who are willing to draw the line a little bit clearer well we sort of have that with I know this has been a discussion that's been going on I don't think it's out of the question but we have a group of probably 35 to 40 right now hopefully that gets bigger of people that pretty much vote the same way on most if not all issues and in fact you know out of the bills that we whip I would say 90% of folks vote the right way but we're not putting the bills forward that we always want to that's part of the reason for that so to me it's less about it's more about how you leverage the power of the Progressive Caucus how do you get more people to vote the way that you think a vote should be going how do you get them the information that they need and then how do you hold them accountable if they do or they don't and so we are in the process of also setting up a 501 C 3 and C 4 called the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center we've just raised 1.5 million in seed money for that and the whole goal is to kind of recreate what was called the Democratic Study Group long time ago Newt Gingrich shut it down we are trying to recreate that put a lot more effort into coordinating inside and outside strategy and pushing the ideas that we want and I think ultimately you know the goal is to try to get all of our members of the caucus to really consider themselves a voting group there's no reason why they shouldn't be a very powerful voting especially in the if it's the majority and and so and you know all my life I've been covering politics for over twenty years well all I ever hear is well the Republican Study Group the freedom caucus the tea party you have to do what they say cuz they have a voting bloc and they won't let things pass without their voting bloc yeah well you guys are real progressives and now you're gonna have real power right so there's no reason why they should not take you and a count just as well yeah and I think they will I mean we're also pushing our own people for leadership you know we're looking at depositions but I think that one thing Republicans did very well is they built an infrastructure I mean when when the study group was disbanded they essentially set up their own version of that they have entire networks that are the resource for pushing inside outside strategy for coordinating for leveraging the power doing all of that and I feel like we are finally getting to the place where we're putting in place some of these ideas electing progressives you know the Progressive Caucus pack tripled this year and so we were able to fund a whole bunch more progressives and we were able to really help these candidates and I think that the story we want to be telling on the day after the election if we take back the houses it was progressives who helped us get there and can people donate to that pack as well yes and we'll get you the link because I don't know it we'll have that in the description box below as well now you know you mentioned you have about 40 people who vote is a block usually roughly as versus that might soon be 50 and so we know for sure that you're gonna have I uh know Presley Alexandria Casa Cortez Ilhan Omar and so that is Holland I mean we have actually a fair number of folks that are coming in that I think will be really strong the other thing we're doing this year is we're having an orientation for our new members before they go in so they know what to expect so that if there are positions that they're running for leadership you know within even the new members you usually get to elect a couple of members nobody ever told me that when we came in so we had no idea yeah and there was somebody who was sort of anointed and appointed and put forward and then everybody voted for them not really understanding so there's a lot of things that I learned just being a new member that we're trying to institute for this year that I think will really help consolidate our progressive caucus members and and have them focus on the caucus our recommendations we're also adding staff inside by the way so we will have more people to whip votes because people just listen to K Street lobbyists there's like a hundred issues on the table in front of us and if they don't know they often will just go to whichever lobbyist is closest we want them to come to our progressive resources so that we tell them okay this is why you don't want to vote for this you know finance bill or this tax bill or whatever it is we don't want you to listen to the corporation's we want you to listen to this set of research I'm pretty sure the new just Democrats coming in are not going to be going to the K Street lobbyists right I mean it's right we can't start with three people is not going to necessarily know right we have to build a more a bigger block of folks and there are some people who are clear already before they come in but there's a lot of people who come in and you know they I think they will be with us but we need to get them what they need so that they are 100 percent right now for those of you who don't know when is when someone wins leadership comes in well this is me not Congress or when jayapal saying this but they say okay here's what you got to do you got to spend half your time raising money you're so you know the witch committee do you want to be on to raise more money it's all about money money money money etc and they're given certain guidance and to me that's most of that guidance is horrific so the fact that there are real progressives in Congress like you that can give them an orientation about wait no no how do we get policy done right how do we stick the other fight together resumes exactly and on the money there are a bunch of candidates who didn't take corporate PAC money we want to keep them not taking corporate PAC money so we're talking about that as well we're working really closely with n Citizens United to make sure that people have what they need to stay in that place of not taking corporate PAC money because 60% of the red to blue candidates now don't take court pack money and we're trying to get more and more I'm doing a lot of work you probably saw that intercept article but I'm doing a lot of work to try to help my colleagues get comfortable with nope you don't need to take back money and in fact anybody can do it you don't have to be a Bernie Sanders or you know whoever some big name you can do it and it it actually is helpful for people to see your integrity and authenticity and not taking it in fact none it's not just for anything it's now better or or having raised more money million dollars in the last quarter alone yeah incredible yeah having raised more money in a Senate campaign than anyone in history with no corporate PAC right so not only is it doable it might be more productive and and remember better now has big names against Ted Cruz and we're almost at the election but when he started he had very little name recognition right very little it's totally doable right he's an inspiring candidate but I also tell people it isn't you know cuz sometimes people are like well what are you saying that I'm voting that way just because I'm getting corporate PAC money and some people do and some people don't it doesn't really matter the point is that we need to be clear with our voters that we represent voters that we represent working people that were not representing corporate special interests and and that that Trust has been so broken that people really want to see you take all the steps necessary to start to rebuild that trust well at the very least there is clearly an appearance of corruption okay yeah and so you should try to avoid the appearance of corruption if you're the party that is supposed to be progressive I would be of course a lot harsher than you are I think yes they they do do what their donors tell them to do okay and in a sense so do you guys it's just that your donors are actual people who just want to have a better life know about that that's right so one more thing which is what you're gonna do to get more people in yeah so you're going around the country trying to get other progressives in right now I have been and it's been really fun I was in Ohio I've been in Indiana with Liz Watson I was in Nebraska with Cara who's just doing an amazing job two hundred and twenty thousand doors I think she said she's her campaign has knocked on last night I was with Katie Porter and they have an incredible campaign and you know I think this is one of the things that's really inspired me is that these candidates are running as bold progressives in swing districts in tough districts districts that have not seen a Democrat sometimes in ten twenty years and they are you know one of them in Cara Eastman's district they call him her Republican flipper because he talks to Republicans and he gets them flipped and he gets them to vote for her or say they're gonna vote for her and I said what are the things that are resonating and and he said $15 minimum wage and Medicare for all and to me I think as proud as I am to be a progressive I'm an English major we should reclaim the word centrist because the etymology of that is you serve the center of the country these policies serve the center of the country why should centrist mean a policy that serves the top 5% or 1% or 10% centrist policies should be policies like $15 minimum wage like college without debt like Medicare for all that served the majority of the country and I think that's what these candidates are running on and they're talking about real economic issues they're not afraid to talk about race they're not afraid to actually be authentic and bold and oh yeah they're talking to people they're going toward a door and they're actually talking to folks at their doors some of whom are saying I've never seen anybody and so long I didn't know anybody cared about me so they're also reestablishing that link to government it's been really really exciting and I'm very hopeful isn't it amazing guys to have strong progressives in Congress I mean it's it feels foreign but I mean for 16 years on this show I've been saying no all the polling is on our side and almost every one of the progressive issues pulls us 60 percent or better all the way up to 84 percent if that's not the center of the country what is if that's not centrist what is meanwhile everybody I came News and in the establishment lies to you and pretends you that they're giving tax cuts the richest centrist starting Wars the centrist giving more defense spending to the defense contractors is that none of those things are true none of them are true it's not in the polls in the polls that American people absolutely positively agree with us now to have those progressive fighters in Congress saying now we're gonna make that a reality and actually pass the laws so you can actually get where you want so holding the world it's been really great we did a poll the progressive caucus did that I led in 30 swing districts because we kept hearing this Oprah milla you're too progressive this just these things just work in Seattle they don't work in swing districts so I thought okay well let's test it so thirty swing districts we had half and a half that mean Democrat lean Republican you know plus or minus five I think it was and the results were off the charts you know independence and what we call our surge voters our progressive base that has tuned out to politics because they're not inspired they don't think we're fighting for them anymore we need to re-engage them but we also do in some cases need to have these independents in these swing districts and we found that they both responded incredibly well and in some cases the independence responded even better give you an example we tested it drives me crazy when people say you can't talk about race okay race is there it's you have to talk about it Donald Trump is making it an issue and so we tested an infrastructure message a bold infrastructure investment of two trillion dollars into and then we tested that against sorry did I say yeah we tested that with the same message saying white black and brown so something like a bold infrastructure package that creates opportunity for everybody white black and brown I can't remember the exact wording but everything was same except for that phrase do you know that that one that had that phrase in it just an acknowledgement of race in there actually did better with independence than not talking about it so I think we have to be authentic and real about what we're trying to do and say to people you're all in this we're all in this together and we we have to be bold that was the other thing that came through a very very clear in the polling people don't want incremental change they want bold change things are bad three people in this country have the same wealth as the bottom 50% of Americans and two of them live in my state so you know we we have got to do something 62% of Americans don't even have $1,000 in their savings account that's just untenable that means their house has a leak the roof has a leak they can't fix it their car breaks down can't fix it kid gets sick mom gets sick don't have health care can't deal with it that's just not who we are we can do so much better I'm so energized it look we don't know what's gonna happen yet you have to go out there and vote you have to volunteer you have to do small to all donations you got to do whatever you can there's only 18 days left okay but if these progressives actually get into Congress then look at all the stereotypes you're gonna break down so first of all in the issue of race notice that the four just Democrats that I named that are definitely going to win all women of color okay you add Deb Holland that's five all women of color okay so what happened I thought we hey no no you gotta appeal to just white people no that's not true it's none of those things I've ever been true medicare-for-all pulls us 70% they call it radical in Washington so 70% of the country radical 52% of Republicans are for Medicare for all are they right I mean so it's a lot of other industrialized countries by the way who are not radical yeah who just have this as a basic given that you need to have certain things provided to you to really even the playing field for everybody representative per millage i appalled one of the true leaders of the rebels we appreciate you coming to rebel headquarter thank you jank it's great to be with you all
