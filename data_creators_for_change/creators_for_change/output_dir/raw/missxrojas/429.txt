1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really really busy which is</font>

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of peculiar because I suppose to</font>

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:05,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">some degree I imagine that the whole</font>

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,580
process as I've come to call it would be

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,389
a lot more moping around the house and

6
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:14,700
watching old home videos and just

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,800
generally been very slow rather than

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,330
feeling rushed off my feet and not

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,060
really having a moment's pause maybe

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,619
that just says things about me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how I</font>

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,449
choose to deal with situations I much

12
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,310
prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep myself busy not</font>

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,140
necessarily to distract<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself but just</font>

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,240
because being busy is what I enjoy more

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,830
than anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world anyway</font>

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,300
so today was one of the few days<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,340
had a chance to be at home and you know

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,719
tidy my room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff which had</font>

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,700
accumulated a lot of things had it

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,469
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> unpacked properly from America</font>

21
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,730
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's just things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

22
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,590
everywhere I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how they</font>

23
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,120
got everywhere I was missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,620
library books and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found them under a</font>

25
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">huge part of clothes I'm starting to</font>

26
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">prepare for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> university as well my desk</font>

27
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,230
is a mess<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now it's all clear and</font>

28
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,699
nice then I came across something that

29
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,100
gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of pause it is a sealed</font>

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,359
and unopened father's day card grown-up

31
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,550
thing written on the front I didn't give

32
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,739
this to my dad because I was angry at

33
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,590
him on fathers day and I can't remember

34
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">why I was angry at him and now it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seems</font>

35
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,659
like the most stupid thing in the world

36
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,880
you know like it just it seems

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,790
ridiculous and I hope lots of you took

38
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,970
part in s<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I hope that you told</font>

39
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,590
your family that you love them because

40
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,119
it is the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing at least</font>

41
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me I find it extremely hard because</font>

42
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,990
I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be stubborn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

43
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,670
particularly good at appealing to my

44
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,100
most vulnerable part of me in fear<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

45
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">be that it shows some kind of weakness</font>

46
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,909
inside of me like that is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

47
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm really really bad at and now it just</font>

48
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,360
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I feel like such an idiot I</font>

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,189
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't just</font>

50
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely beat myself up on it i mean</font>

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,880
if i were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to regret things i would</font>

52
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more than just not giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,530
this Father's Day card but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would have</font>

54
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">been such a simple little gesture and I</font>

55
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,000
was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not only about Esther</font>

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,590
and you know that being her wish for

57
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,990
Esther day but also about was a frank at

58
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,030
VidCon and the way he was talking

59
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,130
everything he does just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to promote</font>

60
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,878
this kindness miss mentality of taking

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,679
the time for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know if you</font>

62
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,410
manage to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out but in the video</font>

63
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,030
I uploaded a little while ago with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

64
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,680
recap kind of VidCon and all that other

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,420
stuff the clip<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Zaire Frankie's him</font>

66
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,310
actually saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that say taking the time</font>

67
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,110
to compose a perfect facebook message

68
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,910
and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit you</font>

69
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bowl of love that</font>

70
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,170
makes a huge difference if kind of I've

71
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,430
always known that that's made a huge

72
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,440
difference and I've always<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to do</font>

73
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to my fullest but it's when you</font>

74
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,560
come across things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

75
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,160
unopened father's day card that you just

76
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,680
think like it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have been so</font>

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,720
much easier just to be kind they really

78
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have and the worst thing is I</font>

79
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,810
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember why I was angry at here</font>

80
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,190
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> just goes to show that it really</font>

81
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,990
didn't matter that much and as long as

82
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,490
