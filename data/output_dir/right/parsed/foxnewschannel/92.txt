SHOW.
>> GREG: THAT TAYLOR SWIFT.
BUT, ENOUGH ABOUT MY SPEEDY
GARMENT MAKER.
MERCY CLAPPING.
I WILL TAKE IT ANYWAY.
THE SINGER ENDORSED ANOTHER
DEMOCRAT THIS WEEK.
CONGRESSMAN JIM COOPER, I DON'T
CARE.
EARLIER SHE ENDORSED ANOTHER
DEMOCRAT, I STILL DON'T CARE.
MEANWHILE TEXAS CONGRESSMAN BETO
O'ROURKE IS TRYING TO OUT SEAT
TED CRUZ.
THERE CALLING HIM KENNEDY ASKED.
HE SURE DRIVES LIKE ONE.
SPEAKING OF TEXAS, SOMEONE
REALLY HATES TED CRUZ.
>> BE CAREFUL.
I HAVE ABOUT 100 OF THESE.
I'M ABOUT TO PUT MORE OUT.
>> I'LL FEEL BETTER ABOUT THIS.
>> I HATE TED CRUZ.
I HATE TED CRUZ.
I'VE BEEN OUT -- I THINK I FOUND
MY HALLOWEEN COSTUME.
AS WE COUNTDOWN TO THE MIDTERMS
LIKE TURNED TO THE COUNT DOWN
CORRESPONDENCE.
HOURGLASS JOE.
HOW MUCH TIME IS LEFT TILL
ELECTION DAY NOVEMBER?
>> 700 BILLION GRAINS OF SAND
UNTIL ELECTION DAY.
>> HOW CAN YOU BE SURE OF THAT?
>> I COUNTED THEM.
>> GREG: 700 BILLION GRAINS OF
SAND.
CAN YOU CONVERT THAT INTO A
MEASUREMENT WE UNDERSTAND?
>> A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.
>> GREG: WOULD THAT BE EASIER
FOR YOU TO SAY THAT?
>> YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
THAT WAS A DUMB IDEA.
>> GREG: THAT'S OKAY.
IF THAT'S HOW FAR WE ARE FROM
NOVEMBER, HOW FAR ARE WE FROM
THE 2020 ELECTION?
>> THAT WOULD BE ABOUT
7.5 TRILLION GRAINS OF SAND TO
THE THIRD POWER.
>> GREG: ACTUALLY IS 745 DAYS, I
CAN JUST SAY THAT.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHY DID I COUNT ALL THE SAND?
IT COULD'VE HAD A FAMILY, WIFE
AND KIDS.
A REAL LIFE.
>> GREG: JOE, WHAT IS THAT IN
YOUR HAND?
>> THE SCORPION.
THE DEADLIEST VENOM ON EARTH.
IT CAN KILL TEN MEN.
I'M GOING TO EAT IT.
MY TIME IS UP.
>> GREG: I GUESS WE LOST
HOURGLASS JOE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENINGS TO
THESE SEGMENTS BUT THEY'RE GOING
IN A DARK, DARK DIRECTION.
>> I FELT A LITTLE BIT BETTER
BECAUSE 700 BILLION IS SLIGHTLY
MORE WHAT WERE SUSPENDED IN
CALIFORNIA TO A FAST TRAIN TO
NOWHERE.
IT IS NOT YET BUILT AT ALL.
>> GREG: WAY TO SAVE THIS
SEGMENT.
>> I'M JUST SAYING.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ABOUT THE
BIGGEST SOME I COULD THINK OF
WHAT WERE SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA
FOR THAT TRAIN.
>> GREG: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
THE MIDTERMS?
>> I FEEL LIKE THERE COULD BE
SURPRISES.
PEOPLE ARE VERY AFRAID TO SAY
WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO AND MAYBE
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY INTEND
TO DO.
I ASKED ON MY RADIO SHOW, IS
DONALD TRUMP AFFECTING YOU GOING
TO THE POLLS.
PEOPLE WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING
BECAUSE I AM ANGRY, SAD, AND
SCARED OF THINGS LIKE A MOB
COMING UP THROUGH MEXICO AND THE
WAY PEOPLE BEHAVE AROUND
KAVANAUGH.
>> GREG: ESCOTT ADAM SAID, MIGHT
BE THE BIGGEST TURNOUT IN
HISTORY.
HE IS NEVER WRONG, TYRUS.
NEVER.
YOU'RE STILL THINKING ABOUT THE
SCORPION, AREN'T YOU?
>> HAVE YOU HAD SOME WEIRD
DREAMS THIS WEEK?
>> GREG: I HAVE BEEN USING A LOT
OF ZEKE WILL.
I THINK IT'S AFFECTING ME.
>> HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING A LOT
OF FRENCH FILMS?
YOU'RE ALL WEIRD.
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.
>> IS LIKE IS IT GOING TO BE I
DON'T KNOW.
THE WAS THE SCORPION THERE THE
WHOLE TIME?
IN HIS POCKET?
PLAN WITH AN HOURGLASS?
>> IT TOOK A LOT OF PREPARATION
FOR THIS.
>> I WANT YOU DRUG TESTED AFTER
THE SHOW.
I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITH THE
SHIP.
I BEEN FIRED A LOT.
I CAN PUT THAT ON MY RESUME.
>> ODDLY ENOUGH, HE'S ONLY
11000.
>> GREG: DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE WE
SHOULD LET THE DEMOCRATS AT
LEAST WHEN SOMETHING MAYBE
BEFORE THEY HAVE A COUNTRYWIDE
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN?
>> PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WERE ON THE
VERGE OF A CIVIL WAR.
NO WERE NOT.
THAT INVOLVES PEOPLE GETTING OUT
OF THEIR HOUSE.
THE ONLY WAY WERE FIGHTING THE
CIVIL WARS OF SOMEONE BUILDS AN
APP.
FORTNIGHT AS THE CIVIL WAR.
I LOVE THAT TAYLOR SWIFT CAME
OUT MADE AN ENDORSEMENT.
TWO DAYS LATER HE DUMPED THAT
FOR KATY PERRTY ENDORSEMENT.
BUT I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.
THE IDEA THAT HILLARY IS BACK ON
THE SCENE AND POSITIONING
HERSELF FOR ANOTHER RUN, WHAT IS
THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS ON HER
RUNNING?
WILL BE AT RALLIES NEXT YEAR
CHANTING HELP HER UP.
THOUGHTS ON TAYLOR SWIFT?
>> IS JUST INTERESTING THE WAY
OUR CULTURE THINK SO YOU LOOK
GOOD DANCING AROUND IN THE
LEOTARD.
I SHOULD CARE WHAT YOU THINK OF
ME WHO IS VOTING.
I DON'T GET IT.
VOTING FOR ME IS LIKE EVERY
MORNING YOU GET OUT OF BED,
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE THOSE
THOUGHTS LIKE WHAT I'M DOING
REALLY MATTER?
WHEN I GET OUT OF BED ON THE DAY
I VOTE I KNOW IT TO DEFINITELY
