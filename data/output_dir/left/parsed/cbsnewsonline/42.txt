KEY SENATORS FROM BOTH PARTIES 
ARE UNDECIDED IN REPUBLICANS 
LOSE MORE THAN ONE GOP VOTE, 
THEY WILL NEED HELP FROM THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
KERRY SEVERINO IS THE CHIEF 
COUNSEL AND POLICY DIRECTOR AT 
THE CONSERVATIVE JUDICIAL 
CRISIS NETWORK WHICH HAS BEEN 
INSTRUMENTAL IN SUPPORTING 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
WALK US THROUGH WHAT WILL BE 
TAKING PLACE NEXT. 
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE VOTE. 
>> THERE WILL BE A VOTE IN THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THESE 
NOMINATIONS WILL MOVE TO THE 
FLOOR AND THEY WILL HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF THE 
SENATE TO VOTE UP OR DOWN ON 
HIS CONFIRMATION. 
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE SENATORS 
WERE CONCERNED WE HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM BOTH 
DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
SO THAT'S WHY THE HEARINGS WERE 
SO IMPORTANT AND THEY WILL LOOK 
AT THAT. 
WE STILL DON'T HAVE 
CORROBORATION. 
SHE DID DELIVER A VERY 
PASSIONATE AND COMPELLING 
TESTIMONY BUT SODA JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
WE STILL DON'T HAVE 
CORROBORATION OR EVIDENCE 
SUPPORTING HER ALLEGATIONS AND 
WHILE A LOT OF STUFF WAS 
UNCOVERED ABOUT SOME OF THE 
DEMOCRAT WORK TO UNDERMINE THE 
INVESTIGATION PROCESS. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALL OF 
THESE SENATORS WILL HAVE ON 
MIND. 
>>> PRETTY MUCH NO MATTER WHERE 
YOU LAND IN TERMS OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND WHETHER HE IS 
WORTHY TO BE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT, I THINK EVERYONE CAN 
AGREE THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN 
GRUELING. 
YESTERDAY WAS EMOTIONALLY 
EXHAUSTING. 
JUST TO WATCH IT WAS 
EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING. 
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS 
LIKE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
DR. FORD. 
WE ARE HEARING THE AMERICAN BAR 
ASSOCIATION HAS ASKED THE 
SENATE TO WAIT UNTIL AN FBI 
BACKGROUND CHECK CAN BE 
PERFORMED BEFORE VOTING. 
>> THE FBI HAS SAID THEY'VE 
DONE THE BACKGROUND CHECK AND 
THEY ADDED THIS INFORMATION TO 
IT. 
WHAT WE SAW IS UNFORTUNATELY 
THE SENATE DEMOCRATS, WHO WERE 
THE ONLY ONES IN POSSESSION OF 
THESE ALLEGATIONS AT THE TIME 
AND THAT WOULD'VE BEEN THE MOST 
APPROPRIATE ROUTE OF 
INVESTIGATION, THEY DID 
NOTHING. 
IT'S STARK CONTRAST TO WHAT THE 
SENATOR DID DURING THE ANITA 
HILL INVESTIGATIONS. 
THEY HELD ON TO THIS AND DIDN'T 
TURN IT OVER TO THE FBI. 
WE ARE AT A POINT ONCE THE 
INVESTIGATION -- CLAIMS ARE 
BLOWN UP IN THE MEDIA, IT 
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO BACK 
AND TRY TO SEPARATE THE 
WITNESSES INDIVIDUALLY AND 
INTERVIEW THEM OR SOMETHING. 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
TAKES OVER AND THERE'S THE SAME 
PENALTIES FOR LYING TO THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT THERE 
IS THE FBI AND IS COVERED BY 
THE SAME STATUTE. 
THEY HAVE BEEN FOR TWO WEEKS 
PERFORMING AN INVESTIGATION. 
THEY HAVE TAKEN TESTIMONY 
EFFECTIVELY UNDER OATH. 
IS UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY FROM 
EVERYONE WHO WAS NAMED. 
ALL OF THE LATER ALLEGATIONS 
THAT THEY REACHED OUT. 
SOME OF THEM HAVE HAD NO 
RESPONSE AS THEY REACHED OUT 
EIGHT TIMES BUT THEY CONTINUE 
TO REACH OUT. 
FORTUNATELY SENATE DEMOCRATS 
ARE REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE. 
THAT'S A SHAME BECAUSE IT 
SHOULD BE A BIPARTISAN EFFORT. 
THEY HAVE BEEN MORE BUSY ASKING 
FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION THAN 
ACTUALLY DOING THE 
INVESTIGATION WE HAVE IN FRONT 
OF US FOR THE 
>> YOU ARE RIGHT. 
IT'S THE SENATE DEMOCRATS THAT 
KEEP ASKING FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
THEY OBVIOUSLY THINK AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION WOULD BE MORE 
VALUABLE THAN THE SENATE IS 
ABLE TO DO OR WHAT THE 
COMMITTEE IS ABLE TO DO. 
WHY IS IT THAT REPUBLICANS 
AREN'T AS INTERESTED IN AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION AT THE DEMOCRATS 
ARE? 
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
LOOKING FOR ONE MORE THING TO 
DELAY THINGS. 
SENATOR BIDEN IS GOING BACK TO 
THE ANITA HILL HEARINGS. 
THE FBI DOESN'T COME TO 
CONCLUSIONS. 
ALL THEY DO IS TAKE TESTIMOY. 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS 
DOING THAT AND IT'S THE SAME 
THING THAT HAPPENED AFTER ANITA 
HILL'S APPLICATIONS -- 
ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE PUBLIC. 
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE 
THE FBI DO IT WHEN YOU ALREADY 
HAVE THE REAL DECISION-MAKERS 
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 
THAT'S THE SENATORS AND THEY 
HAVE TO BE THE ONES MOVING 
FORWARD TAKING THAT TESTIMONY. 
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN 
INVESTIGATION, PLEASE TAKE PART 
IN THE ONE ACTUALLY HAPPENING 
BEFORE YOUR EYES. 
>> CERTAINLY SOME REPUBLICANS 
EXPRESS WHAT YOU ARE EXPRESSING 
INCLUDING SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA AS A 
DIRECTLY ADDRESS HIS FELLOW 
SENATORS. 
HE WAS VERY EMOTIONAL. 
>> TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, 
IF YOU VOTE NO, YOU'RE 
LEGITIMIZING THE MOST 
DESPICABLE THING I HAVE SEEN IN 
MY TIME IN POLITICS. 
>> AT THIS POINT, AND YOU KNOW 
THERE WERE IF YOU REPUBLICANS 
THAT WERE IN QUESTION.  
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE WAS ONE 
GOING INTO THIS HEARING. 
ARE THERE ANY SENATE 
REPUBLICANS WHO COULD JEOPARDIZE
BRETT KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION? 
>> I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL 
UNDECIDED BUT THERE'S ALSO 
SEVERAL SENATE DEMOCRATS 
UNDECIDED AND YOU HAVE SENATOR 
MANSION, HIGH CAMP, DONNELLY 
WHO HAVE NOT MADE UP THEIR 
MINDS AND IT'S A KEY VOTE. 
IN WEST VIRGINIA, WITH SENATOR 
TED MANSION THEY THINK JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE CONFIRMED 
AND THAT WAS EVEN BEFORE THESE 
HEARINGS WHICH MIGHT PUSH IT 
FATHER AMONG INDEPENDENTS. 
THAT'S 26%. 
IN NORTH DAKOTA, WITH HEIDI 
HEITKAMP, THAT'S A WIDER MARGIN 
WITH 25% OF ALL VOTERS AND 30% 
INDEPENDENCE. 
I THINK A LOT OF THOSE SENATE 
DEMOCRATS WILL BE THINKING HARD.
IF I VOTE AGAINST JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, IS THIS JUST LOOKING 
LIKE A VOTE FOR A VICIOUS 
CAMPAIGN ORCHESTRATED BY SOME 
OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATS TO 
TAINT THE NOMINATION? 
THAT WILL BE A HARD VOTE FOR 
THEM TO WANT TO TAKE IF THEY 
ARE VOTING AGAINST SOMEONE WHO 
BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS JUST ONE OF 
THE MOST QUALIFIED NOMINEES 
EVER FOR THIS POSITION. 
>> IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A 
ROUGH GO. 
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS HAS 
BEEN UGLY, HURTFUL, AND I THINK 
MANY PEOPLE WATCHING PROBABLY 
FELT SYMPATHY FOR BOTH OF THOSE 
PEOPLE TESTIFYING YESTERDAY. 
I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU THINK 
THE IMPACT OF THIS BE -- MAYBE 
MOVING FORWARD IF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IS CONFIRMED. 
WILL THERE ALWAYS BE SORT OF AN 
ASTERISK BY HIS NAME? 
WILL YOU ALWAYS ASSOCIATE THIS 
WITH THE PROCESS AND IMPACT THE 
WAY WE FEEL ABOUT THE SUPREME 
COURT? 
>> SEEMS TO BE THE GOAL BUT I 
DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE THE 
RESULT FOR THE 
>> WHEN YOU SAID THEIR GOAL 
WHAT YOU MEAN? 
>> I GUESS I MEAN THE DEMOCRATS 
PATH GOAL. 
THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO -- 
DELEGITIMIZE HIS POSITION. 
I WORK FOR JUSTICE THOMAS WHO I 
THINK IS ONE OF THE GREAT 
THINKERS IN THE COURT PEOPLE 
TRY TO DO THAT TO HIM. 
THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES KNOW 
BRETT KAVANAUGH VERY WELL AND 
THEY HAVE FOUND HIM VERY 
INFLUENTIAL. 
THEY HAVE INDICATED HIS 
OPINIONS 14 TIMES IN THEIR 
REASONING. 
HE'S A SOMEONE WHO COMMANDS A 
LOT OF RESPECT AND THEY WILL 
HAVE A LOT OF MUTUAL RESPECT 
FOR EACH OTHER EVEN ACROSS 
THE'S IDEOLOGICAL DIVIDES. 
I THINK IT SAYS MORE OF A 
PROBLEM WITH OUR SENATE 
JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION PROCESS 
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. 
THAT'S THE REAL IMPACT. 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
IS ENGAGED EVEN BEFORE THIS. 
IT WAS ALREADY A CIRCUS THE WAY 
THEY WERE TREATING THIS 
NOMINATION BUT AT THE END OF 
THE DAY ON I THINK 
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS ARE 
GOING TO HAVE A LONG-TERM 
IMPACT ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
OUTSIDE OF THE PARTISAN 
COMMUNITY. 
>>> IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL 
HOLD A VOTE ON BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION TO THE Ãº 
ED O'KEEFE IS ON CAPITOL HILL 
FOLLOWING THOSE DEVELOPMENTS. 
GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT THE 
FEELING IS LIKE ON CAPITOL 
HILL. 
>> Reporter: IT'S NAILBITING 
TIME BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
WILL TRANSPIRE IN THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 
WE THINK THAT ALL 11 
REPUBLICANS WILL VOTE FOR 
KAVANAUGH BUT AT LEAST ONE, 
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA HAS NOT 
SAID WHAT HE PLANS TO DO. 
ANY SECOND THAT COULD BE SOME 
TWEET OR ANNOUNCEMENT FROM HIS 
OFFICE OF HIS INTENTIONS. 
OTHERWISE WE WILL WAIT AND IF 
AND -- IN SUSPENSE. WE EXPECT 
THAT WILL BEGIN WITH SOME 
SQUABBLING BETWEEN THE SIDES 
AND IF YOU WERE STATEMENTS FOR 
MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES. 
AT SOME POINT, CHAIRMAN 
GRASSLEY WILL CALL OUT A VOTE. 
EVEN IF HE IS REFERRED OUT OF 
THE COMMITTEE WITHOUT A 
POSITIVE VOTE, REPORTED 
UNFAVORABLY, AS THEY SAY IN THE 
SENATE, MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 
McCONNELL SAYS HE'S BRINGING IT 
TO THE FULL SENATE AND A SERIES 
OF PROCEDURAL MOVES THAT ARE 
LIKELY TO START ON SATURDAY 
MORNING AND WOULD LEAD TO A 
VOTE ON TUESDAY. 
AGAIN, IN ADDITION TO FLAKE WE 
ARE WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT SUSAN 
COLLINS OF MAINE AND LISA 
MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND WE WILL 
SEE IF ANY DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY 
SIGN UP FOR THIS, AS WELL. 
>> ANYBODY WHO WATCHED 
YESTERDAY'S TESTIMONY PROBABLY 
WALKED AWAY EMOTIONALLY 
EXHAUSTED. 
IT'S BEEN A REALLY EXHAUSTIVE 
PROCESS. 
I WONDER IF ANY OF THE 
LAWMAKERS YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO 
HAVE DISCUSSED HOW THEY FEEL 
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE 
NOMINATION PROCESS AND HOW IT 
LOOKS AS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
WATCHES ON. 
>> I RAN INTO COREY BOOKER OF 
NEW JERSEY LAST NIGHT AFTER 
THIS HAD ENDED AND I SAID, WHAT 
DID YOU MAKE OF THIS? 
IS THIS A MOMENT THAT WILL 
STAND OUT IN YOUR MEMORY IN 
PERPETUITY? 
HE SAID THERE WASN'T ANYTHING 
TERRIBLY MEMORABLE. 
HE SAID, I KNOW TALKING TO MY 
COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES AND 
THAT THIS WAS SORT OF SICK AND 
SAD AND I THINK THAT THE 
GENERAL PERCEPTION THAT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE HAD APPEAR YESTERDAY 
AND AFTER AND DURING EIGHT 
HOURS AND 45 MINUTES OF THAT. 
THIS IS JUST NOT A GOOD MOMENT 
FOR THE SENATE, NOT A GOOD 
MOMENT FOR CONGRESS, NOT A GOOD 
MOMENT FOR THE COUNTRY AT ALL 
BECAUSE YOU HAD THE 
INTERSECTION OF PARTISAN 
POLITICS, THE ME TOO MOVEMENT, 
THE CLASSIC UNIVERSAL, HE SAID, 
SHE SAID. 
JUST GENERAL NASTINESS THAT 
PERVADES WASHINGTON THESE DAYS. 
>> SO TRUE. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY FROM 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE'S EXPECTED VOTES. 
THE REPUBLICANS HOLD A ONE SEAT 
ADVANTAGE ON THE COMMITTEE AND 
THAT WAS SENT KAVANAUGH TO THE 
FULL SENATE AFTER THAT FOR 
VOTING ALONG PARTY LINES. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS ACCUSER 
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE 
YESTERDAY. 
LAWMAKERS ARE GATHERING 
CHITCHATTING AHEAD OF THE VOTE 
TODAY AND AS YOU HEARD FROM ED 
O'KEEFE AND NANCY CORDES, THE 
EXPECTATION IS BEFORE THEY VOTE 
THEY WILL HAVE A LOT TO SAY. 
IF YESTERDAY WAS ANY INDICATION 
OF WHAT WE WILL SEE TODAY, 
PERHAPS THEY ARE EXHAUSTED, WE 
WILL PROBABLY HEAR SOME SIMILAR 
REQUESTS FROM THE DEMOCRATS 
ABOUT AN FBI INVESTIGATION, 
FARM THE REPUBLICANS 
COMPLAINING ABOUT AN 
INTENTIONAL DELAY OF THIS 
NOMINEE MOVING FORWARD. 
>>> WE ARE JOINED BY REPUBLICAN 
STRATEGIST LESLIE SANCHEZ AND 
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST JOEL 
PAYNE. 
I'M EMOTIONALLY SPENT AND I 
DIDN'T TESTIFY YESTERDAY. 
>> I THINK THAT'S THE SENTIMENT 
OF SO MANY. 
THE THING ABOUT DR. FORD'S 
TESTIMONY IS IT UNEARTHED 
CONFLICTING, EMOTIONAL 
REACTIONS FROM WOMEN OF MANY 
GENERATIONS. 
THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS 
ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT, WHAT WAS 
ACCEPTED AND EVERYBODY KNOWS 
THAT FRATERNITY TYPE OF 
CULTURE. 
IT HARKENS BACK TO WHETHER IT'S 
A FAIR CONNECTION OR NOT AND 
BECAUSE OF THAT, IT HAS A 
LINGERING EFFECT AND IT'S A 
FREQUENCY THAT I THINK A LOT OF 
WOMEN IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND. 
FOR THAT REASON, IF FOR 
KAVANAUGH MOVES FORWARD THERE 
WILL ALWAYS BE THIS SUSPICION 
AND HIS HYPERPARTISANSHIP. 
WE KNOW REPUBLICANS ARE MOVING 
THIS THROUGH POLITICALLY TO 
SAVE THEMSELVES IN THE MIDTERMS 
BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED TO 
HAVING THESE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT BUT AT WHAT EXPENSE? 
THAT WILL BE MY CAUTION TO THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE THIS 
WILL NOT GO AWAY. 
IS THIS REALLY THE BEST WE CAN 
DO? 
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. 
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AS I 
SAW THE RHETORIC HEATING UP AND 
PEOPLE BECOMING MORE PASSIONATE 
AND UNDERSTANDING THIS WAS A 
CAMPAIGN PROMISE AND THE 
PRESIDENT REALLY WANTED TO BE 
ABLE TO DELIVER ON THIS 
PROMISE. 
WILL THEY WIN THE BATTLE AND 
THAT THEY GOT KAVANAUGH? 
BUT LOSE THE WAR BECAUSE PEOPLE 
ARE FIRED UP ABOUT THIS. 
JOAL, WHAT YOUR TAKE ON HOW THE 
DEMOCRATS HANDLED THEMSELVES? 
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS 
ACQUITTED THEMSELVES RELATIVELY 
WELL. 
THIS WAS NOT SET UP TO MAKE 
ANYBODY REALLY LOOKED GREAT. 
THIS WAS NOT SET UP OBVIOUSLY 
-- I THINK THE ONE THING WE 
ACCOMPLISHED YESTERDAY IS THAT 
THE SENATE FIGURED OUT HOW TO 
NOT REDO ANITA HILL FROM 25, 30 
YEARS AGO. 
I THINK EVERYBODY WENT OUT-OF-
THE-WAY TO NOT HAVE A REPLAY OF 
THAT AND WE WILL TREAT DR. FORD 
WITH RESPECT.  
WE ARE GOING TO TREAT HER WITH 
A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CARE AND 
CONCERN. 
I WILL SAY THAT IT DOES APPEAR 
THAT EVERYBODY WENT OUT-OF-THE-
WAY IN THAT HEARING ROOM AND 
EVEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN HIS 
TESTIMONY. 
HE DID NOT REALLY GO OUT -- 
WHILE HE DENIED HE WAS THE 
PERSON THAT SHE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT, HE DID NOT CAST 
ASPERSIONS ON WHAT SHE WAS 
SAYING ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE. 
I DO THINK THAT THE SIGNIFICANT 
AND IT'S TELLING ABOUT THE 
MOMENT WE ARE IN, LESLIE, THAT 
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IN 
2018 IS AN OKAY THING TO DO. 
PEOPLE ARE NOT OKAY WITH THAT. 
>> I FEEL LIKE I HEARD ECHOES 
OF THAT. 
WE DID NOT SEE ANY OTHER 
TESTIMONY FROM ANYBODY ELSE. 
I AM PICKING OUT SOME PHRASES. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH CALLED THIS A 
CALCULATED, ORCHESTRATED, 
POLITICAL HIT AND I THOUGHT OF 
HIGH TECH LYNCHING. 
THEY BOTH CALLED IT A CIRCUS IN 
THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS. 
JUSTICE THOMAS AND KAVANAUGH 
CALLED IT A CIRCUS AND A 
DISGRACE. 
I DID HEAR LITTLE ECHOES AND 
MAYBE THAT'S JUST A 
COINCIDENCE. 
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT 
THE FACT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
-- I THINK LESLIE'S PROBABLY 
RIGHT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN 
NOT THAT HE WILL BE CONFIRMED. 
THE JOB OF THESE FOLKS IS TO 
GET IT RIGHT AND KNOW HOW TO 
COUNT TO PICK A MITCH McCONNELL 
KNOWS HOW TO COUNT. 
IT HAS JUST COME OUT IN THE 
LAST FEW MINUTES JEFF FLAKE 
WILL BE A YES VOTE. 
THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE AND HE 
WOULDN'T HAVE PUT THAT UP 
UNLESS HE KNEW THAT JEFF FLAKE 
WOULD BE A YES. 
JUST THE IDEA THAT SENATE 
REPUBLICANS FELT COMFORTABLE 
ENOUGH TO DO THAT, I THINK IT 
TELLS ABOUT HOW THEY FELT ABOUT 
THE HEARING YESTERDAY. 
THEY PASS THE LITMUS TEST TO AT 
LEAST GET BRETT KAVANAUGH OVER 
THE HUMP BUT I DON'T THINK 
BRETT KAVANAUGH PASSED TO THE 
SUPREME COURT TEST. 
WHILE HE MAY HAVE PASSED THE 
BELIEVABILITY THRESHOLD AND 
DEFEND HIMSELF AND MAY HAVE 
MADE THE AUDIENCE IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAPPY, I DON'T BELIEVE HE 
COMPORTED HIMSELF AS A SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE BECAUSE AS A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, YOU HAVE 
TO BE IMPARTIAL. 
OU HAVE TO HAVE 
I DIDN'T MAKE A DECISION. 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CLINTON 
MONEY, THE CLINTON LEFTISTS AND 
THAT IS NOT REALLY CONDUCT OF A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
>> HE IS UNBIASED. 
HE HAS WRITTEN 300 OPINIONS AND 
THERE'S A LONG RECORD BUT 
THERE'S ALMOST 2 SIDES TO BRETT 
HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF. 
THERE'S THIS ONE, YOUNG, 
EXUBERANT, DRINKING -- HE WAS 
MAD AND EMOTIONAL. 
HIS TEMPERAMENT I DO FEEL 
DISQUALIFIED HIM BECAUSE OF THE 
WAY HE BEHAVED. 
IF THAT WAS A WOMAN, SHE WOULD 
BE GONE. 
THIS DOUBLE STANDARD -- WE HAVE 
TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND LAY THAT 
OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE EXPECT 
OUR SUPREME COURT TO LOOK OUT 
-- LIKE. 
DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THIS KIND 
OF THING? 
IF WE SLOWED IT DOWN A BEETS, 
AND MIGHT HAVE A NATURAL 
CONCLUSION AND NOW I SOUND LIKE 
THESE CONSERVATIVES GETTING 
MAD. 
WE WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. 
>> LET'S LISTEN AND BECAUSE 
LAWMAKERS ARE TALKING NOW.>> 
IT'S A SHAME. I THINK SHE MADE 
A GOOD WITNESS. 
I LIKED HER AND THERE COMES A 
TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT'S 
RIGHT AND MAKE A GREAT JUDGE. 
>> TO YOU STILL BELIEVE THE 
ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE 
INVESTIGATED? 
>> I THINK SHE'S MISTAKEN. 
WITH ALL THAT I KNOW, I THINK 
SHE'S MISTAKEN AND I DO BELIEVE 
KAVANAUGH. 
HE'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTER AND A 
VERY FINE MAN. 
I THINK SHE'S A FINE WOMAN, 
TOO, SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS 
DIFFICULT. 
>> APPRECIATE IT, EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> WE WOULD JUST HEARING FROM 
ORRIN HACH AND HE EXPRESSED 
SOMETHING WE HAVE HEARD FROM A 
LOT OF OTHER REPUBLICANS AND 
HOW THEY RECONCILE THESE TWO 
COMPLETELY OPPOSING STORIES. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH STUCK TO HIS 
STORY THAT HE WAS NEVER AT AN 
EVENT LIKE THAT. 
HE DOESN'T KNOW HER. 
NOT EVEN THAT THEY WERE CASUAL 
FRIENDS AT ALL AND SHE SAYS SHE 
WAS 100% SURE HE WAS THE ONE 
THAT ASSAULTED HER. 
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WILL FLY 
AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND THE 
PUBLIC WILL EMBRACE THAT? 
>> FROM THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE 
AND THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS THEY 
WILL BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT 
DELIVERED. 
>> HOLD THAT THOUGHT. 
>> IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WE 
ARE NOT PREPARED TO DEAL WITH 
OR SUPPORT WOMEN WHO ARE 
SURVIVORS OF THIS KIND OF 
HORRIFIC ACT IN A VERY GOOD 
WAY. 
WHAT IS THE MOST TELLING OF ALL 
IS THAT THEY WILL NOT GO FOR A 
INVESTIGATION BY A NEUTRAL 
ENTITY WHICH IS THE FBI. 
THEY WILL NOT GO THERE. 
THAT IS VERY TELLING. 
FRANKLY, IF THE REPUBLICANS 
THINK THAT COMMITTEE PEOPLE 
DOING THE INVESTIGATION IS 
EQUIVALENT TO THE FBI, GIVE ME 
A BREAK.>> IF DEMOCRATS TAKE 
BACK THE SENATE WOULD YOU BE 
SUPPORTIVE OF LOOKING INTO 
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH ONCE 
AGAIN? 
>> WE ARE NOT THERE YET AND I 
AM TOTALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT WE 
NEED TO DO. 
GOING FORWARD EVEN IF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS CONFIRMED UNDER 
THIS KIND OF A HUGE CLOUD IS 
BAD ENOUGH THAT WE SENT ONE 
PERSON TO THE SUPREME COURT 
WITH THIS KIND OF CLOUD WE 
SHOULD NOT BE SENDING BOTH. 
AS I HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR 
MONTHS AND ALERTING EVERYONE TO 
THE COURT PACKING THAT IS GOING 
ON WITH THE JUDGES WHO WERE SO 
IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN AND 
OUTCOME DRIVEN THAT THAT IS NOT 
GOOD FOR THE COURT, WHICH 
SHOULD BE PEOPLE WITH -- I 
DON'T MIND IF THE CONSERVATIVE 
AS LONG AS I CAN BE ASSURED 
THAT THEY CAN BE FAIR AND 
IMPARTIAL. 
AND TOO MANY OF THESE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE REALLY FEDERALIST 
SOCIETY AND HERITAGE FOUNDATION 
ANOINTED PEOPLE HAVE AN OUTCOME 
DRIVEN AGENDA AND THAT IS NOT 
WHERE WE SHOULD BE FOR THE 
>> I'M NOT RESIGNED TO 
ANYTHING. 
I WILL JUST KEEP ON GOING. 
THERE'S OTHERS I WILL HOPE WILL 
SEARCH THEIR SOULS AND DO THE 
RIGHT THING FOR THE COURT, THE 
COUNTRY, AND ALL THE WOMEN AND 
SURVIVORS IN THIS COUNTRY. 
>> AS PROMISED, AS SOON AS THE 
VOTE STARTED, WE WOULD TAKE YOU 
THERE ALIVE SO I WILL HAVE YOU 
LISTEN. 
>>> WE WERE HAVING A LOT OF 
EMOTIONS FROM -- CAN WE HAVE 
QUIET FROM THE AUDIENCE.
IS THERE SOMEBODY THAT CAN 
SIGNAL TO ME THAT THE CHAIRS 
ARE FILLED AND THAT WE CAN HAVE 
SOME PEACE AND QUIET? 
I'D LIKE TO START OUT TODAY 
WHERE WE LEFT OFF ON SEPTEMBER 
13. 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS A NEW MEETING, 
BUT I WAS ANTICIPATING A LOT OF 
EMOTIONS FROM THE MINORITY AND 
WE DID HAVE SOME EMOTIONS FROM 
THE MINORITY BUT IF YOU 
REMEMBER, I SAID I WILL GIVE 
THE MINORITY A CHANCE TO MAKE 
THEIR MOTIONS AND THAT I WAS 
GOING TO MAKE A MOTION THAT WE 
HAVE A TIME CERTAIN TO VOTE. 
I WANT TO MAKE THAT MOTION TIME 
CERTAIN TO VOTE BUT IF THERE'S 
A MOTION FROM A MINORITY, I 
WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT MOTION 
FIRST.>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD 
LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO 
SUBPOENA MARK JUDGES A WITNESS 
BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE. 
>> LET ME -- HOLD ON A MINUTE. 
COULD YOU MAKE YOUR REMARKS 
SHORT, PLEASE AND SPEAK NOW AND 
WE WILL VOTE. 
>> WE HEARD YESTERDAY FROM AN 
EXTRAORDINARILY COURAGEOUS, 
STRONG, SURVIVOR DR. CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD. 
EVERY ONE OF US, I THINK, WERE 
RIVETED AND POWERFULLY 
IMPRESSED BY HER TRUTH. 
WE HEARD HER PROVIDE DETAILS IN 
THAT STORY THAT CAN BE 
CORROBORATED AND OTHER FACTS 
THAT CAN BE UNCOVERED. 
IF WE HEAR FROM OTHER WITNESSES 
WHO HAVE VERY RELEVANT AND 
IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED TO HER ON THAT EVENING 
IN THAT ROOM. 
THE THIRD PERSON ALLEGEDLY IN 
THE ROOM WAS MARK JUDGE. 
EVIDENTIALLY HE HAS NEVER BEEN 
INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI. 
HE IS NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY 
ANY MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE. 
HE HAS NEVER SUBMITTED A 
DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE 
KNOWS, AND, SO, I MOVE, MR. 
CHAIRMAN, THAT WE HAVE HIM 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AS A 
WITNESS. 
HE COULD BE INTERVIEWED BEFORE 
HAND ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. 
I RECOGNIZE THAT HE HAS 
SUBMITTED A CURRENT CURSORY, 
CONCLUSORY SIX SENTENCE LETTER, 
NOT EVEN SIGNED BY HIM BUT FROM 
HIS ATTORNEY AND I BELIEVE WE 
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO 
SUBPOENA, AT THE VERY LEAST, 
MARK JUDGE, BEFORE WE MOVED TO 
VOTE. 
IT IS OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY 
TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO 
UNCOVER THE TRUTH AFTER HEARING 
YESTERDAY THAT COMPELLING 
TESTIMONY FROM DR. CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD AND WE CANNOT IN 
GOOD CONSCIENCE VOTE WITHOUT 
HEARING AT LEAST FROM MARK 
JUDGE. 
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I WOULD 
SUBMIT THERE ARE OTHER 
WITNESSES ESSENTIAL TO HEAR 
FROM AND WE SHOULD HEAR FROM 
THE OTHER SEXUAL ASSAULT 
SURVIVORS WHO HAVE COME FORWARD 
WITH CREDIBLE AND POWERFUL 
STORIES, AND THAT WILL BE ALSO 
IN MY VIEW NECESSARY. 
TODAY I AM MOVING THAT WE 
SUBPOENA MARK JUDGE. 
>> BEFORE WE VOTE, I WILL READ 
A LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED FROM 
MARK JUDGE LAST NIGHT AS I 
STATED IN MY ATTORNEY BARBARA 
VAN GALDER, SEPTEMBER 18, 2018 
LETTER, I DID NOT ASK TO BE 
INVOLVED IN THIS MATTER NOR DID 
ANYONE ASK ME TO BE INVOLVED. 
WE HAVE TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT 
I DO WANT TO COMMENT -- WHEN I 
TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT I DO 
NOT WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT THESE 
EVENTS PUBLICLY, AS A 
RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC AND A 
CANCER SURVIVOR, I HAVE 
STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION AND 
ANXIETY. 
AS A RESULT, I AVOID PUBLIC 
SPEAKING. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND I WERE 
FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
BUT WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN DIRECTLY 
IN SEVERAL YEARS. 
I DO NOT RECALL THE EVENTS 
DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD IN HER 
TESTIMONY BEFORE THE U.S. 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
TOAY. 
I NEVER SAW BRETT KAVANAUGH ACT 
IN A MANNER DR. FORD DESCRIBES. 
I AM KNOWINGLY SUBMITTING THIS 
LETTER UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY. 
MARK JUDGE, WITNESSED BY 
BARBARA VAN GALDER. 
HE SIGNED IT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IF I MAY 
RESPOND -- 
>> ON THE MOTION? 
>> YES PICK UP THAT LETTER IS 
NO SUBSTITUTE FOR AN FBI 
INTERVIEW. 
>> THE ANSWER IS, NO. 
>> MR. GRAHAM -- 
>> IT IS NO TESTIMONY BEFORE 
THIS COMMITTEE. 
>>  
THE VOTES ARE 10 YAY, 11 AYE.>> 
THE MOTION IS DEFEATED AND WE 
SET THE VOTE AT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION AT 1:30 
PM TODAY.>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> POINT OF ORDER. 
>> I AM FOLLOWING THE RULES OF 
THE COMMITTEE. 
>>  
IT VIOLATES THE CUSTOMS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
>> I STRONGLY OBJECT. 
THIS IS JUST TOTALLY 
RIDICULOUS. 
THE ANSWER IS NO, NO, NO. 
>> THEY ARE NOT ANSWERING 
BECAUSE THIS IS SO UNFAIR, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
11 AYE, 8 NAY.>> MOTION 
CARRIED. 
WE HAVE AN AGENDA WITH 10 
JUDGES WHO ARE READY TO BE 
VOTED ON. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH NOMINATED TO 
THE SUPREME COURT OF, JONATHAN 
COVERS, NOMINATED TO THE EIGHTH 
CIRCUIT AND EIGHT JUST RECORD 
JUDGES. 
WE ALSO HAVE TWO BILLS ON THE 
AGENDA AND WE WILL HOLD OVER 
S3178 THE JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS 
OF LYNCHING ACT. 
WE WILL VOTE ON S ACT SPONSORED 
BY SENATORS DURBIN AND GRAHAM. 
THIS BILL COMBATS DEFENSIVE -- 
OFFENSIVE ELECTION INTERFERENCE 
TO ANY FOREIGN NATIONAL WHO HAS 
BEEN DEEMED TO ENGAGE IN 
ELECTION INTERFERENCE. 
THE AMENDMENT I WILL BE 
INTRODUCING MAKES CLEAR THE 
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
WILL MAKE THIS DECISION ON WHO 
HAS ENGAGED IN ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE AND A CONSULTATION 
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE AND THE SECRETARY 
OF STATE AND ANY FOREIGN 
NATIONAL WHO ENGAGES HER 
CONSPIRES TO ENGAGE IN THE 
IMPROPER INTERFERENCE IN OUR 
ELECTION SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED 
TO ENTER OUR COUNTRY UNDER ANY 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
EXCEPT TO STAND TRIAL. 
YESTERDAY WE HEARD TESTIMONY 
FROM DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH REGARDING 
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS THAT 
DATE BACK TO WHEN THE TWO WERE 
IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
IT WAS DIFFICULT AND EMOTIONAL 
FOR BOTH OF THEM. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 
THREE WITNESSES DR. FORD NAMED 
DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE 
EVENT SHE DESCRIBED. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FORCEFULLY 
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS. 
THE ALLEGED BEHAVIOR IS 
INCONSISTENT WITH EVERYTHING 
ELSE WE KNOW ABOUT HIM. 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING 
WOMEN HE KNEW IN HIGH SCHOOL 
ATTESTED TO HIS CHARACTER AND 
FUNDAMENTAL DECENCY AS A PERSON 
BOTH IN HIGH SCHOOL AND NOW. 
HE IS WIDELY REGARDED AS AN 
EXCELLENT HUSBAND, FATHER, 
FRIEND, COACH, PROFESSOR, JUDGE 
AND IS AN EXEMPLARY RECORD OF 
BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF 
WOMEN'S ADVANCEMENT IN THE 
LEGAL PROFESSION. 
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH SIX FBI 
FULL-TIME BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATIONS AND NO ISSUES OF 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WERE 
UNCOVERED. 
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF 
FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS THAT 
THE ACCUSER HAVE THE BURDEN OF 
PROVING ALLEGATIONS. 
IT'S TRUE YESTERDAY -- 
YESTERDAY'S HEARING WAS NOT A 
TRIAL BUT TRIALS HAVE RULES 
BASED ON COMMONSENSE NOTIONS OF 
FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS. 
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. 
A PERSON HAD ALLEGATIONS MADE 
AGAINST HIM IN A PUBLIC WAY AND 
HIS REPUTATION AND LIVELIHOOD 
WERE AT STAKE. 
IT WAS ONLY FAIR THAT HIS 
ACCUSER HAD THE BURDEN OF 
PROOF.  
IN MY OPINION, THIS WASN'T 
MEANT. 
YOU FOLKS THAT ARE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS KNOW THAT YOU ARE 
SUPPOSED TO SIT DOWN. 
MAYBE YOU JUST WANT TO LEAVE 
THE ROOM IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT 
THE RULES ARE.  
I DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY CREDIBLE 
AND BELIEVE SHE IS SINCERE IN 
HER VERSION OF THE FACTS BUT HE 
ALSO FOUND JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
TESTIMONY CREDIBLE AND SINCERE, 
ULTIMATELY THE EXISTING 
EVIDENCE INCLUDING THE 
STATEMENT OF THREE ALLEGED 
EYEWITNESSES NAMED BY DR. FORD 
REFUTES DR. FORD'S VERSION OF 
THE FACTS. 
THERE IS SIMPLY NO REASON TO 
DENY JUDGE KAVANAUGH A SEAT ON 
THE SUPREME COURT ON THE BASIS 
OF EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO US. 
I REOPEN THE HEARING AT THE 
ASSISTANCE OF DR. FORD AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
DR. FORD WANTED TO BE HEARD, 
AND WE GAVE HER THAT 
OPPORTUNITY. 
NOT ONE QUESTION TO DR. FORD 
WAS DISRESPECTFUL IN ANY WAY. 
SHE WAS TREATED WITH COURTESY 
AND DIGNITY AS I PROMISED HER 
BUT THE QUESTIONS MY DEMOCRAT 
COLLEAGUES ASKED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY 
AND UNIVERSALLY HOSTILE. 
MY COLLEAGUES FIRST CLAIMED THE 
SENATE DOESN'T CONFIRM SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEES IN MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
THE WASHINGTON POST/CHECKER 
SAID THAT'S FALSE. 
INDEED JUSTICE -- 
>> CAN WE HAVE QUIET, PLEASE. 
I WOULD EXPECT THE SAME QUIET 
FROM OTHER PEOPLE ON THE 
COMMITTEE WHEN THEY SPEAK. 
>> INDEED JUSTICE CATERER AND 
BRYAN WERE CONFIRMED AND THE 
ATTEMPT WAS TO ARGUE WE NEEDED 
TO REQUEST ALL JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
RECORDS. 
THEY COMPLETELY IGNORE THE FACT 
THAT WE DID NOT REQUEST ALL OF 
JUSTICE KAGAN'S EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH RECORDS. 
HER MOST RECENT AND RELEVANT 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH RECORDS FROM 
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL'S OFFICE 
WERE NOT REQUESTED. 
EVEN DESPITE THE FACT THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS SPENT THE 
LAST 12 YEARS ON THE SECOND 
MOST -- EVEN THOUGH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS SPENT THE LAST 12 
YEARS ON THE SECOND MOST 
POWERFUL COURT IN THE COUNTRY 
ISSUING 307 OPINIONS AND 
JOINING HUNDREDS OF OTHERS, WE 
RECEIVED OVER 480,000 PAGES OF 
DOCUMENTS FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S TIME ON THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 
THIS WAS MORE PAGES OF SUCH 
DOCUMENT THAN THE LAST FIVE 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES 
COMBINED. 
IN SHORT, IT WAS THE MOST 
THOROUGH AND TRANSPARENT 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 
I'M GOING TO PUT THE REST OF MY 
STATEMENT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE 
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
IRRITATED RIGHT NOW AND I WILL 
LET THEM EXPRESS THAT 
IRRITATION. 
WE WILL GO BY SENIORITY. 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN. I WILL PUT 
THE REST OF MY STATEMENT IN THE 
RECORD. 
>> I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT 
WE ARE HERE TODAY VOTING ON 
THIS NOMINATION. 
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE 
TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD 
YESTERDAY. 
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SPENT 
THEIR TIME AT THE HEARING 
FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON POLICY 
AND PARTISANSHIP AND PROCESS. 
THE MAJORITY ARGUED THE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT DR. FORD EXPERIENCED 
WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A 
DEMOCRATIC SMEAR CAMPAIGN AND I 
AM ALLEGEDLY ORCHESTRATING. 
MY STAFF AND I WERE ACCUSED OF 
LEAKING DR. FORD LETTER, WHICH 
WE DID NOT. 
WE WERE ACCUSED OF LEAKING 
DEBORAH RAMIREZ'S LETTER WHICH 
WE DID NOT. 
WE WERE SAID TO HAVE REFUSED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE PARTISAN, 
QUOTE, INVESTIGATION. 
YET IT IS THE REPUBLICANS WHO 
HAVE REFUSED TO TALK TO DEBBIE 
RAMIREZ OR JULIE SWETNICK. 
REPUBLICANS ALSO FAILED TO 
MENTION DEMOCRATS WERE NOT 
NOTIFIED AND HAD NO IDEA THAT 
CHAIRMAN STEPH HAD THE 
COMMUNICATING WITH MARK JUDGE 
PATRICK SMITH LEAVING KAISER 
AND APPARENTLY AT LEAST TWO 
OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT 
BEEN NAMED. 
THEY LEARNED ABOUT THIS WHEN 
VARIOUS LETTERS OR EMAILS 
APPEARED AND IN ONE CASE, WE 
LEARNED ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN 
STAFF OUTREACH AT 10 PM THE 
NIGHT BEFORE THE HEARING. 
IRONICALLY, MY COLLEAGUES ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HAD 
GONE SO FAR AS TO SAY THIS 
WHOLE SITUATION WAS NOTHING 
MORE THAN A NEFARIOUS ATTEMPT 
AT POLITICAL THEATER. 
I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DID THAT. 
THE SENATE IS A POLITICAL BODY. 
I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TAKE THE SAME TONE 
AND STRATEGY. 
CANDIDLY, IN THE 25 YEARS ON 
THIS COMMITTEE, I HAVE NEVER 
SEEN A NOMINEE FOR ANY POSITION 
BEHAVE IN THAT MANNER. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH USED AS MUCH 
POLITICAL RHETORIC AS MY 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AND HE 
WENT ON THE ATTACK. 
HE YELLED THE DEMOCRATS FOR 
HAVING THE TEMERITY TO EXPRESS 
OUR FRUSTRATION, FOR NOT HAVING 
ACCESS TO OVER 90% OF HIS 
RECORD. 
AND SAID THAT SOME DEMOCRATIC 
MEMBERS WERE, QUOTE, Aâ ND 
EMBARRASSMENT -- AN 
EMBARRASSMENT AND REFUSED -- 
ACCUSED DEMOCRATS OF LYING IN 
WAIT. 
>>> WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
JUDICIAL NOMINATION PROCESS AND 
EVERY CUSTOM THE SENATE EMBRACE 
BEFORE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 
PRETTY MUCH DESTROYED. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL EVER BE 
REVIVED. 
SOMEBODY TOOK MRS. FORD'S 
ANONYMOUS LETTER AND LEAD IT TO 
THE PRESS NOT GIVING A DAM 
ABOUT HER TO SLOW THE PURPOSE, 
DELAY THE VOTE, TRYING TO 
DESTROY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT TO THE 
EFFECT IT HAD ON DR. FORD. 
WHAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
I LIKE DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WOULD DO 
THIS BUT SOMEBODY DID. 
AND THE THREE GROUPS TO LOOK AT 
OUR HER STAFF, THE LAWYERS, AND 
THE CONGRESSWOMAN FROM 
CALIFORNIA. 
THE DETAILS THAT WERE LEAKED 
OUT DID NOT COME FROM A FRIEND. 
THIS WAS PLANNED. 
THE FOURTH LETTER -- BEFORE THE 
ACCUSATION. 
IS ANYBODY HERE FROM NBC? 
ARE YOU READY? 
CORY GARDNER RECEIVED AN 
ANONYMOUS LETTER WITH NO 
POSTMARK AND HE BROUGHT IT TO 
THE COMMITTEE SEVERAL DAYS AGO. 
ABOUT AN ALLEGED INCIDENT IN 
1998 IN A RESTAURANT WITH NO 
DETAILS OF WHO IT WAS AND NO 
POSTMARK BUT HE FELT LIKE HE 
SHOULD TURN IT OVER.  
ALL I CAN SAY IS AN ANONYMOUS 
LETTER -- IF THAT CAN MAKE NEWS 
AND AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF A 
COMMITTEE, WHERE REALLY GOING 
TO DESTROY THE PROCESS. 
WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT NBC IS 
THAT YOU RAN WITH IT AND WHAT 
BOTHERS ME MORE IS SOMEBODY ON 
THEIR SIDE GAVE IT TO YOU. 
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT 
WITH A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. 
TO MY FRIENDS AT NBC, DON'T 
WRITE OFF CONSERVATIVE CONCERNS 
ABOUT NBC TO ROGER ELSE. 
YOU NEED TO THINK LONG AND HARD 
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID ABOUT THE 
INVITATION. 
THE CUSTOMS OF THE COMMITTEE, 
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY BENT OVER 
BACKWARD TO MAKE SURE DR. FORD 
COULD BE HEARD AT ANY TIME AND 
LOCATION OF HER CHOOSING AND I 
WAS STUNNED TO HEAR FROM DR. 
FORD THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW IT 
WAS AVAILABLE TO HER TO TESTIFY 
IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE 
CONDITIONS THAT SHE WOULD 
REQUEST. 
I FIND THAT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 
>> WHY IT ACCEPTED?
IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE
DEBACLE WE WITNESSED YESTERDAY,
AND SEEMED SEEMED SO TO MY GOOD
FRIEND,
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE
ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THIS
COMMITTEE.
I DON'T TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT
AN FBI INVESTIGATION.
IF YOU REALLY WONDERED WHAT THE
FBI COULD OR SHOULD DO, YOU
WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD IN A
TIMELY MANNER.
THE FBI IS NOT GOING TO TELL US
ANY MORE THAN WE KNOW NOW.
AS TO THE ACCUSATIONS, I WENT
THROUGH ALL FIVE AND I WOULD SAY
THIS.
THERE ARE NO STATUTE OF
LIMITATIONS IN MARYLAND, SO IF
SOMEBODY WANTED TO GO THROUGH
THIS CASE, IF YOU COULD FIND OUT
WHAT TOWN IT HAPPENED AND WHEN
IT HAPPENED, AND YOU CAN MAKE A
COMPLAINT AGAINST JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AND IF THAT COMPLAINT
IS TAKEN TO A COURT AND HE'S
CONVICTED, I WILL BE THE FIRST
ONE TO SAY WE NEED TO LOOK AT
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I WILL BE IN
THE NBA.
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN
THE LOW -- LOWEST POINT OF THE
COMMITTEES SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE
AND IT'S JUST RANK WITH POLITICS
AND NOBODY REALLY CARE BODY DR.
FORD AND NOBODY REALLY CARED
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND WHEN
I HEAR MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES
OENLY SAY IF WE CAN DELAY THIS
PAST THE MID-TERMS, WE TAKE BACK
THE SENATE AND KEEP THIS SEAT
UNFILLED.
DISGUSTING.
>> SO WE JUST HEARD FROM LINDSEY
GRAHAM OUTSIDE OF THE CHAMBERS
THERE.
REITERATING SOMETHING HE SAID
VERY PASSIONENTLY DURING THE
HEARING YESTERDAY --
PASSIONATELY SINCE YESTERDAY,
BLAMING FOR POLITICIZING THIS
PROCESS, WONDERING WHO LEAKED
SOME OF THE LETTER THAT DR. FORD
WROTE ABOUT THIS ACCUSATION --
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT MORE
SENATORS TALKING.
WE'RE GOING TO DIP BACK IN.
>> THIS HAS GOT TO STOP.
I'M NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN
THIS CHARADE ANYMORE.
ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES TALKED
ABOUT THIS IS A SHAM.
THIS IS A SHAM WHAT'S GOING ON.
DEMOCRATS ARE NOT BEING HEARD.
THEY'RE PUSHING THROUGH THIS
PROCESS AND FRANKLY, THE
STATEMENTS YESTERDAY WERE ABOUT
BULLYING FELLOW SENATORS AND
ABOUT
BULLIES.
ALL WE HAVE ASKED FOR, IS THERE
BE AN FBI INVESTIGATION.
DR. FORD CAME IN AND SHE POURED
OUT HER HEART.
SHE COOPERATED WITH THE PROCESS
AND GAVE THE PROCESS DIGNITY AND
RESPECT.
THE LEAST WE COULD DO IS GIVE
HER THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT OF
HAVING A PROCESS THAT HAS
CREDIBILITY.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING
SOMEBODY ON THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT FOR A LIFETIME.
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR DEMOCRACY
AND THE INTEGRITY OF OUR
DEMOCRACY, YOU WLD THINK
MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES
SENATE WOULD SAY WAIT A MINUTE,
THERE IS ENOUGH TO PUSH PAUSE,
LET'S REFLECT ON WHAT WE'RE
ABOUT TO DO.
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ABOUT
THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE IN TERMS
OF A SYSTEM THAT IS ABOUT TO BE
AND IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT
JUSTICE.
>> I'M HERE TO JOIN MY
COLLEAGUES IN OBJECTING TO THE
SHAM PROCESS THAT IS GOING
FORWARD RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NEXT TO
US IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
THIS ADDS TO THE SEQUENCE OF
SHAM PROCESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN.
I THINK IT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN
THE HISTORY OF BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATIONS FOR NEW AND
CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS TO COME
FORWARD AND THE BACKGROUND
INVESTIGATION NOT BE REOPENED.
ALL THREE CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS
HAVE RECEIVED 0 INVESTIGATION BY
THE FBI.
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.
THE PARTISAN SHIP THAT WAS ON
DISPLAY IN YESTERDAY'S HEARING
WAS NOT RIGHT.
IT WAS NOT RIGHT FROM MY
COLLEAGUES.
IT WAS PARTICULARLY NOT RIGHT
FROM THE NOMINEE.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A DISPLAY
OF VENGEFUL, PARTISAN,
CONSPIRACY THEORY BEHAVIOR AND
NOW WE HAVE THIS SHAM PROCESS IN
THE COMMITTEE WHICH RAISES THE
QUESTION WHY?
WHY ARE THEY SO DESPERATE TO GET
THIS PERSON THE COURT WITHOUT A
PROPER INVESTIGATION.
THANKS.
>> WHAT WE'RE WATCHING IS A
BETRAYAL.
IT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A
BETRAYAL OF THE UNITED STATES
SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO
ADVISE AND CONSENT.
THAT DUTY CAN BE DONE ONLY IF WE
UNCOVER ALL OF THE FACTS, GOOD
OR BAD, ABOUT A NOMINEE.
THERE HAS BEEN NO ADEQUATE FBI
INVESTIGATION, THERE HAS BEEN NO
SUFFICIENT FACT FINDING.
THERE HAS BEEN BARELY A PROCESS
OF CONSIDERING THE PEOPLE WHO
OUGHT TO BE HEARD.
YESTERDAY WE HEARD FROM A POWER
FULLY CREDIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT
SURVIVOR.
THIS PROCESS BE TRAYS ALL OF THE
HOLLOW, HYPOCRITICAL RESPECT
THAT OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE
HER.
RAMMING THROUGH THIS NOMINATION
WITHOUT HEARING FROM MARK JUDGE,
AND OTHER RELEVANT WITNESSES,
AND WITHOUT ANY INVESTIGATION IS
A BETRAYAL OF OUR PROMISE TO
THOSE SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS
THAT THEY WOULD BE HEARD
RESPECTIVELY, AND THIS PROCESS
IS BEING WATCHED.
ALL OF AMERICA IS WATCHING THE
UNITED STATES SENATE TODAY AND
THEY SHOULD BE DEEPLY
DISAPPOINTED, EMBARRASSED,
ASHAMED OF SUPPOSEDLY THE
WORLD'S GREATEST DELIBERATIVE
BODY SINKING TO A LOW THAT
DENIES SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVEYORS,
THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD.
THERE ARE TWO THAT SHOULD BE
CALLED AS WITNESSES.
THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES LIKE
MARK JUDGE WHO NEED TO BE CALLED
ABOUT THIS NOMINEE, AND THERE
NEEDS TO BE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION.
TRAINING PROFESSIONALS, NOT THE
STAFF OF THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.
TRAINED PROFESSIONALS, NOT --
>> WE'RE TRYING TO COVER ALL THE
ACTION HERE.
THERE IS STUFF HAPPENING IN THE
CHAMBER, IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM
AND OUTSIDE THIS THE HALLWAY.
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO DRASTIC
SENATORS WHO HAVE WALKED OUT OF
THE COMMITTEE ROOM EXPLAINING
WHY THEY'VE LEFT AND NOW WE'RE
GOING TO HEAD BACK IN.
SENATOR GRASSLEY IS TALKING.
>> UNLIKE HER DEMOCRAT
COLLEAGUES, THEY DEDUCTED THEIR
OWN PRIVATE INVESTIGATION,
RATHER THAN THE CHAIRMAN.
I FIRST LEARNED OF HER
ALLEGATIONS WHEN THEY BECAME
PUBLISHED "THE NEW YORKER"
PUBLISHED LATE IN THE EVENING,
SUNDAY 23rd, AND CONTACT THE
COUNSEL, ASKING WHEN SHE WAS
AVAILABLE FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS.
THE NEXT AFTERNOON WISH HER
COUNCIL RESPONDED MS. RAMIREZ
QUOTE HAS ACCURATELY RELAYED
WHAT SHE RECALLS TO THE NEW
YORKER, END QUOTE.
HE COUNSEL ADDED, QUOTE SHE
WOULD BE WELCOMED AN
INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI INTO
THIS INVESTIGATION AND WOULD
COOPERATE WITH SUCH.
ON APPROPRIATE TERMS SHE WOULD
ALSO AGREE TO BE INTERVIEWED IN
PERSON, END QUOTE.
OVER THE 24th AND THE 25th, OF
THIS MONTH, MY STAFF REPEATEDLY
ASKED MS. RAMIREZ COUNSEL TWO
QUESTIONS BEFORE SETTING UP A
CALL TO DISCUSS HER ALLEGATIONS
SO THAT SUCH A CALL COULD
ACTUALLY BE MEANINGFUL AND
USEFUL.
NUMBER ONE WHETHER SHE HAD QUOTE
ANY OTHER EVIDENCE INCLUDING
OTHER STATEMENTS IN ADDITION TO
THOSE THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE
NEW YORKER ARTICLE END OF QUOTE,
AND TWO WHETHER SHE WAS QUOTE
WILLING TO PROVIDE HER EVIDENCE
INCLUDING HER TESTIMONY TO
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS, END OF
QUOTE.
MY STAFF REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR
THAT IT WELCOMED QUOTE RECEIPT
OF MS. RAMIREZ'S IN THE FORM OF
LETTER OR CHAIRMAN OR RANKING
MEMBER A LETTER FROM OR E-MAIL
FROM COUNSEL TO THE CHAIRMAN OR
RANKING MEMBER OR A STATEMENT TO
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS.
MS. RAMIREZ COUNSEL HAS STILL
NOT PROVIDED ANY EVIDENCE TO
COMMITTEE STAFF.
IF EVIDENCE EMERGED WE OF COURSE
WOULD PROCEED AS APPROPRIATE.
MY STAFF ALSO ACTED SWIFTLY TO
SET UP AN INTERVIEW WITH JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
HE UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED MS.
RAMIREZ'S ALLEGATIONS.
I REGRET MY DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES
AGAINST FAILED TO TIMELY BRING
THIS RELEVANT INFORMATION TO HIS
ATTENTION.
>> ALL RIGHT.
BACK OUT INTO THE HALLWAY,
LISTENING TO THE DEMOCRATIC
SENATORS OUTSIDE TALKING, HERE'S
MS. HARRIS.
>> THEY'VE BEEN PUSHING AND
RAMMING THIS THING THROUGH
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE OUR AS
OPPOSED TO POT SBEG ITY THE
INTEGRITY.
HAVE TRANSPARENCY.
THIS IS A FAILURE OF THIS BODY
TO DO WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS SAID
IT'S ABOUT, WHICH IS ABOUT
DELIBERATIVE.
>> HOW MUCH COORDINATION AND
DISCUSSION YOU-ALL DO IN ADVANCE
OF YESTERDAY'S HEARING AND WHY
WAS THERE SO MUCH FOCUS ON THE
FBI INVESTIGATION RATHER THAN
THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS PAST?
>> YOU DON'T THINK AN FBI
INVESTIGATION IS AT THE CORE OF
ALL OF THIS?
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN SAYING IF NOT
THIS?
WE DO NOT COORDINATE WALKING
OUT.
WE FEEL THIS IN HERE, OKAY, AND
THAT'S WHY ALL THE PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO SAY QUESTIONING.
>> THE LINE OF QUESTIONING AT
YESTERDAY'S HEARING DID YOU
DISCUSS THE QUESTIONS YOU WOULD
ASK JUDGE KAVANAUGH?
>> WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?
>> WE'VE BEEN CALLING FOR AN FBI
INVESTIGATION FOR THE FIRST TIME
WE LEARNED ABOUT THIS LETTER
FROM DR. BLASEY FORD.
WE HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR
HEARINGS AND ADDITIONAL
WITNESSES FROM DAY ONE.
THERE IS NOTHING NOVEL AND THERE
IS NO NEED TO COORDINATE BECAUSE
THIS POINT IS ABSOLUTELY OBVIOUS
TO EVERY AND IT'S OBVIOUS TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE SENATE
IS RAMMING THROUGH THIS
NOMINATION, EXAMINING JUDGE
KAVANAUGH THROUGH THE PROCESS
WITHOUT KNOWING THE FACTS, BUT
EVENTUALLY, FACTS WILL COME OUT
AND THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL
INVESTIGATIONS AND THE TRUTH
WILL OUT.
>> AND YOU HAVE TO BE CLEAR ALSO
THE SMOKE SCREENS THAT WE'RE
SEEING.
SO THEY PUT A PROSECUTOR IN,
RIGHT?
THIS -- THE PERSON IN FROM THE
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN MARICOPA
COUNTY TO GIVE THE SUGGESTION
THIS WAS A HEARING THAT WAS
ABOUT GETTING INTO EVIDENCE AND
FACTS.
WELL, SHE SAID HERSELF AND HER
PROTOCOL SAYS, IT'S VERY CLEAR
YOU DON'T DO THIS WITHOUT AN
INVESTIGATION.
THE FBI IS AN AGENCY OF SWORN,
TRAINED LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS.
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO AN
INVESTIGATION, SO UNDERSTAND THE
MISLEADING SUGGESTION YESTERDAY
THAT THIS HEARING WAS
SUFFICIENT.
IF THIS HEARING WERE SUFFICIENT,
WE WOULD NOT AS A MATTER OF
COURSE HAVE THE FBI DO A
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION EVERY
TIME WE HAVE A NOMINEE TO THAT
COURT BUT THEY WANTED TO CUT OFF
THAT PROCESS AND YOU HAVE TO ASK
WHY.
YOU HAVE TO ASK THAT.
>> YOU SAY THEY HAVE THE POWER.
PERHAPS WHAT CAN YOU DO NOW?
>> WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.
>> WE'RE GOING TO USE EVERY TOOL
AVAILABLE.
>> ALL RIGHT.
THERE IS A LOT GOING ON.
YOU CAN SEE THE SPLIT SCREEN
THERE.
ONE SHOWS INSIDE THE COMMITTEE
ROOM FOCUSED ON SENATOR
GRASSLEY.
OUTSIDE, YOU HAVE A GROUP OF
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO HAVE
GATHERED.
THEY WALKED OUT OF THE
PROCEEDINGS AND EXPLAINING WHY
THEY CHOSE TO WALK OUT.
I WANT TO BRING IN ED O'KEEFE SO
YOU CAN HELP US SORT OF
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WAITING FOR
A VOTE BUT THERE WAS A MOTION
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, A MOTION
FROM SENATOR BLUMENTHAL ABOUT
SUBPOENAING MARK JUDGE, AND THEN
AFTER THAT, IT SEEMED LIKE
THINGS SORT OF WENT OFF THE
RAILS.
JUST EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENED SO
FAR THIS MORNING.
>> RIGHT, SO WE CONVENED AT 9:30
AND WE WERE EXPECTING THEM TO
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF VOTING FOR
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
WHAT CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY SAID
WE'RE VOTING AT 1:30 ON BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
IF WE WANT TO SPEND THE NEXT FEW
HOURS YELLING AND SCREAMING,
FINE.
IF WE WANT TO FILE MOTIONS TO
DELAY THIS EVEN LONGER, OKAY,
BUT WE'RE HOLDING AN INTERVIEW
WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH.
WHAT YOU SAW WAS FOUR DEMOCRATIC
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE
GOING TO VOTE NO AND WALK OUT.
WHEN I ASKED THEM WILL YOUR
CHAIR BE EMPTY AT 1:30.
THEY ADMITTED THEY DON'T KNOW.
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING
IS MAKING NOISE.
AT THIS POINT, PROCEDURAL,
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL DEMOCRATS
CAN DO IS REPUBLICANS PLAN TO
HOLD THIS VOTE.
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING
WITH THIS NOMINATION.
DEMOCRATS, LIBERALS, CRITICS OF
THE PRESIDENT, CONCERNED ABOUT
IT, TRYING TO DO WHATEVER THEY
CAN DO STOP IT AND IT HAS CREDIT
SEND OWED SINCE THE ALLEGATIONS
OF BRETT KAVANAUGH.
ALL OF THESE DEMOCRATS CAN DO IS
GO TO THE MICROPHONES, ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE TO CALL AND DELAY THINGS.
AND REALLY THERE ARE PROTESTERS
IN THE BUILDING BEHIND US.
THE POLICE ARE KEEPING US BACK,
BUT THEY'VE BEEN BLOWING
WHISTLES AND SAYING THINGS LIKE,
NOVEMBER IS COMING, NOVEMBER IS
COMING, WHICH IS TO SAY
ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND
PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER THIS, AND
WE'LL SEE NOW THROUGOUT THE DAY
HOW THAT TRANZ PYRES TRAN PYRES
AND IF
ANYTHING -- TRANSPIRES AND IF
ANYTHING DOES.
AT THIS POINT WE BELIEVE ONLY
TWO REPUBLICANS WHO HAVEN'T SAID
WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO.
BEYOND THEM YOU HAVE TO KEEP AN
EYE ON JOE MANSION, JOE
DONNELLEY, AND HEIDI HEITKAMP.
HOW DOES THIS WORK FROM A
POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE?
HOW THIS NOMINATION BECOMES
FINAL, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO REALLY
IS KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE FIVE
PEOPLE.
THE REST IS JUST NOISE.
>> YOU DIDN'T MENTION JEFF
BLAKE.
IS HE NO LONGER IN CONTENTION?
>> HE SAID EARLIER ANNE-MARIE,
BEFORE THE HEARING BEGAN HE'S A
YES VOTE.
HE LAST NIGHT WAS PART OF A
MEETING WITH COLLINS AND
MURKOWSKI, HE MADE CLEAR HE WAS
WITHHOLDING JUDGMENT UNTIL THE
HEARING WAS OVER AND THIS
MORNING SAID HE WILL VOTE YES.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WITH
JEFF FLAKE BECAUSE PEOPLE GET
THIS CONFUSED SOMETIMES.
HE'S ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
BIGGEST CRITICS SO MUCH SO HE
WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT.
HE'S NOT GETTING CHRISTMAS CARDS
FROM THE TRUMP FAMILY ANYMORE
BUT WHEN YOU ASK HIM IS THERE
ANYTHING PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES
THAT HE LIKES?
HE SAID I LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE NOMINEES ON SUPREME COURTS.
THEY ARE EXACTLY LOOT MEN AND
WOMEN I WANT TO SEE SERVING ON
DISTRICT COURTS AND APPEALS
COURTS.
LAST YEAR HE WAS OVER THE
NOMINEE MOON ABOUT NOMINEE NEIL
GORSUCH AND WAS CONCERNED WHEN
THESE ALLEGATIONS HAD TO BE
HANDLED ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE SENATE AND THE WAY IT
HANDLES THINGS.
IN HIS VIEW, IT HAS.
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND HE'S
NOT POSSIBLY RULED OUT FOR 2020
AS PRESIDENT.
IF YOU VOTE AGAINST A GUY WHO IS
BY ALL MEASURES A JUDICIAL
CONSERVATIVE, WHO WANT TO BE
SEEN ON THE COURT SEPARATE FROM
HIS ALLEGED BEHAVIOR, THEN WHY
WOULDN'T YOU VOTE FOR SOMEBODY
LIKE THIS IF YOU'RE STILL
THINKING ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL
FUTURE.
>>IT WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT
OF TAPE.
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PROFIT ORS
DOWN THE HALL AND ABOUT THE
MESSAGE -- PROTESTORS DOWN THE
HALL BUILT MESSAGE THEY'RE
TRYING SEND AND WHO KNOWS WHAT
FLAKE'S FUTURE PLANS ARE.
HE WAS ACCOSTED EARLIER.
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THAT.
>> I WANT THE STORY OF MY SEXUAL
ASSAULT.
I TOLD THEM I RECOGNIZE SHE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH.
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ALLOWING
SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY VIOLATED A
WOMAN TO SIT IN THE SUPREME
COURT.
THIS IS HORRIBLE.
YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN YOUR
FAMILY.
THINK ABOUT THEM.
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN.
I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT FOR THE
NEXT 50 YEARS, THEY WILL HAVE TO
HAVE SOMEONE IN THE SUPREME
COURT WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
VIOLATING A YOUNG GIRL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIR?
>> I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND
NOBODY BELIEVES ME.
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE AND YOU'RE
TELLING ALL WOMEN THEY DON'T
MATTER, THEY SHOULD JUST STAY
QUIET BECAUSE IF THEY TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM, YOU'RE
GOING TO IGNORE THEM.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ALL
WOMEN IN AMERICA, THAT THEY
DON'T MATTER.
YOU SHOULD JUST KEEP IT TO
THEMSELVES BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE
TOLD THE TRUTH, YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO HELP THAT MAN TO POWER
ANY WAY.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ALL
THE WOMEN.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
RIGHT NOW.
LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO
YOU.
YOU'RE TELLING ME MY ASSAULT
DOESN'T MATTER.
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DOESN'T
MATTER.
AND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LET
PEOPLE WHO DO THESE THINGS INTO
POWER.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHEN YOU VOTE FOR HIM.
DON'T LOOK AWAY FROM ME.
LOOK AT ME AND TELL ME THAT
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN TO ME, THAT
YOU'LL LET PEOPLE LIKE THAT COME
INTO A HIGHEST COURT OF THE LAND
AND TELL EVERYONE WHAT THEY CAN
DO TO THEIR BODIES.
DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER, SENATOR?
>> DO YOU THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH
IS TELLING THE TRUTH?
DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S ABLE TO
FEEL THE PAIN OF HIS COUNTRY AND
REPAIR IT?
THAT IS THE WORK OF JUSTICE, THE
WAY THAT JUSTICE WORKS IS YOU
RECOGNIZE HURT, YOU TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT, AND THEN
YOU BEGIN TO REPAIR IT.
YOU'RE ALLOWING SOMEONE WHO IS
UNWILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS AND HARM HE
DOES TO ONE WOMAN -- ACTUALLY
THREE WOMEN AND END REPAIR IT.
YOU ARE ALLOWING SOMEONE WHO IS
UNWILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS ACTIONS TO SIT IN THE
HIGHER COURT OF THE COUNTRY AND
TO HAVE THE JOB OF PREPARING THE
HARM THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS
COUNTRY TO MANY PEOPLE.
NO THANK YOU.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER?
>> QUESTIONS FOR THE SENATOR?
>> I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.
DON'T TALK TO ME.
TELL ME.
I'M STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF
YOU.
DO YOU THINK HE'S TELLING THE
TRUTH?
DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH TO THE COUNTRY?
>> SO MANY WOMEN ARE POWERLESS.
>> I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU.
>> CAN YOU NOT GIVE HIM AN
ANSWER, SENATOR?
YOU JUST RELEASED A PRESS
STATEMENT.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO
GIVE THEM AN ANSWER?
THANK YOU IS NOT AN ANSWER,
SENATOR.
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU IS NOT AN ANSWER.
WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR
COUNTRY, SIR?
>> YOU CAN BE A HERO TODAY.
>> BE A HERO.
>> YOU COULD BE A HERO AND VOTE
NO.
WHY NOT WAIT?
WHY NOT WAIT?
WHY NOT WAIT FOR THE
INVESTIGATION?
THERE'S NO ARM.
>> HOW YOU CAN BE SPEECHLESS?
WE DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING.
DO YOU STAND WITH WOMEN?
DO YOU STAND WITH THIS NATION
WHO DESERVES DUE PROCESS?
>> SENATOR DO YOU WANT TO
RESPOND TO THEIR COMPLAINTS?
SENATOR DO YOU CARE TO RESPOND
TO THOSE COMPLAINTS?
>> I NEED TO GO TO THE HEARING.
I ISSUED A STATEMENT.
>> YOU CAN SEND AN E-MAIL?
YOU CAN'T GIVE AN ANSWER?
>> THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF
QUESTIONS.
DO THESE WOMEN NOT DESERVE AN
ANSWER?
>> WHY DON'T YOU WAIT FOR AN FIB
INVESTIGATION?
>> EVERYONE DESERVES AN ANSWER.
>> BE A HERO.
DO WHAT IS RIGHT.
>> ED O'KEEFE, I KNOW YOU'RE
STANDING BY, THAT WAS SENATOR
JEFF FLAKE BEING CONFRONTED BY
SOME PROTESTORS AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING WAS WHEN WE
FIRST HEART ABOUT BRETT
KAVANAUGH, THE CONCERN FOR SOME
PEOPLE WAS IDEALOGICAL, HIS
POINT OF VIEW ON ROE V. WADE AND
SUCH THINGS IN RELATIONS TO THE
ISSUES THAT AFFECT WOMEN AND NOW
IT'S BECOME VERY PERSONAL, THOSE
WOMEN WERE TELLING JEFF FLAKE
THEY WERE ALSO VICTIMS, THAT
THEY FELT THAT BY SUPPORTING
BRETT KAVANAUGH THEY WERE --
THAT HE WAS DISPLAYING A LACK OF
COMPASSION, A LACK OF
UNDERSTANDING FOR VICTIMS ACROSS
THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING
THEMSELVES.
SENATOR FLAKE REALLY FOUND
HIMSELF IN A POSITION WHERE
THERE WAS NO RIGHT OR WRONG
ANSWER.
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY TO
THESE LADIES.
>> AND THIS KIND OF DIRECT
CONFRONTATION IS RARE, BUT THERE
WAS A SIMILAR EXCHANGE YESTERDAY
BETWEEN LINDSEY GRAHAM AND A
WOMAN WHO TOLD THEM SHE HAD BEEN
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND HE
BASICALLY TOLD HER IN RESPONSE,
YOU SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO THE
POLICE ABOUT THAT.
BASICALLY SAYING THERE IS REALLY
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
THIS PLACE IS TEAMING WITH
PROTESTORS AND COPS.
YESTERDAY WE WERE TOLD AT LEAST
1,200 WERE HERE.
EVERY AVAILABLE CAPITAL POLICE
OFFICER IS ON DUTY TODAY.
SOME OF THEM WORKING 16-HOUR
DAYS TO MAKE SURE THIS PLACE
REMAINS SOMEWHAT CALM AND
ORDERLY.
THEY KEEP DEPLOYING OUT OF A
BACK ROAD HERE JUST TO THE SIDE
OF THE HEARING ROOM AND THEY'VE
BEEN BLOCKING OFF THE ABILITY OF
PROTESTORS TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR
THIS HEARING ROOM, CHECKING
I.D.s AS YOU ROUND EVERY CORNER.
THAT'S A RARE SIGHT HERE BUT
SPEAKS TO THE STAKES AND WHAT'S
GOING ON.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN
APPOINTMENT, YOU CAN STILL COME
IN.
EVERYONE RESPECTS IT AS LONG AS
YOU'RE ORDERLY.
THIS KIND OF CON41TATION, RARE
BUT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE REAL
PASSION AND CONCERN THAT A LOT
OF PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON.
>> HOW DIFFICULT IS THIS FOR
THESE -- THESE OLDER MALE
LAWMAKERS?
WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE
COMMITTEE HEARING THEY BROUGHT
IN A FEMALE PROSECUTOR TO
QUESTION THE VICTIM, DR. FORD,
BUT AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD, AS
I'M WATCHING SENATOR FLAKE'S
FACE AND THEY'RE DEMANDING SOME
SORT OF RESPONSE FROM HIM AS TO
WHETHER OR NOT HE KNOWS JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AND HE SAID HE DID
BELIEVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IT'S
JUST VERY EASY I WOULD THINK FOR
SOME OF THESE SENATORS TO SAY
THE WRONG THING WHEN THEY TALK
ABOUT HOW THEY WERE PERSONALLY
VIOLATED IT'S GOT TO BE A TIGHT
ROPE WALK FOR THEM.
>> IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING
THEY'RE NOT USED TO AND THE
REASON WHY THEY BROUGHT IN THAT
PROSECUTOR FROM MARICOPA COUNTY,
ARIZONA WHO QUIZZED DR. FORD
DURING THE HEARING.
THERE WAS GRAVE CONCERN A PANEL
OF ALL WHITE OLDER MEN TRYING TO
ASK THIS WOMAN QUESTIONS WOULD
BE SEEN IN THIS ERA AS SOMETHING
JUST TOTALLY OUT OF THE NORM AND
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE REALLY
POLITICALLY RISKY.
THEY TOOK IT, THEMSELVES TO
QUESTION JUDGE KAVANAUGH, OR
SPEAK TO HIS CHARACTER.
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT A LOT OF THESE
PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY
CONFRONTED ON A REGULAR BAY SUS.
NOT ONLY ARE THEY OLDER MEN BUT
CAN COME IN STATES THAT SUPPORT
THE PRESIDENT, THAT ARE MORE
CONSERVE TIFF WHERE VOTERS ARE
PROBABLY FAVORING JUDGE
KAVANAUGH OVER THE ALTERNATIVE
AND CORRECT TO SEE PEOPLE LIKE
HIM WHEN 2 TO HIS RULE IT
BECOMES IN
CONNECTION WITH HIS IDEOLOGY,
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER ONES IN
PLACES LIKE ARIZONA, TEXAS FOR
TED CRUZ, IS FACING A BIG
RE-ELECTION THIS YEAR.
YESTERDAY BROKE ALL SORTS OF
NORMS.
THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF
DEQUORUM.
I DO WONDER BECAUSE WE'VE
STARTED TO SEE A LOT MORE OF
THIS, WHETHER DIRECT
CONFRONTATION, EITHER HERE OR
WHEN THEY'RE OUT FOR DINNER, ON
THE AIRPLANE HOME, WHETHER THAT
WILL BE THE NORM AND WHETHER
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
WE'VE SEEN THE THREATS AGAINST
LAW MAKERS SPIKE TO RECORD
LEVELS ESPECIALLY REPUBLICANS
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN POWER.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ARE NOT
ACCUSTOMED TO AND FRANKLY
THEY'RE CONCERNED AND AFRAID OF.
>> IT'S DEFINITELY UNDER -- ONE
CAN UNDERSTAND I'M THINKING
ABOUT ORIN HATCH BEING ASKED
WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT DR. FORD
WAS SHE WAS ATTRACTED AND NICE
AND UNDERSTOOD AS AN ATTRACTIVE
WITNESS BUT IT WAS JUST SORT OF
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF, YOU KNOW,
HERE'S A GUY THAT MAY NOT QUITE
SORT OF GET IT, WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE.
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE
COMMITTEE ROOM BUT I WANT TO ASK
YOU ONE MORE QUESTION, IF
DEMOCRATS DO NOT RETURN AT 1:30,
DOES THE VOTE GO AHEAD?
DOES IT MATTER HOW MANY SENATORS
ARE THERE?
>> YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE QUORUM,
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
AT LEAST ONE OR TWO DEMOCRATS IN
THE ROOM AND YOU PROBABLY WILL,
AND IN THEY DO AND WE ALREADY
SENSE AND KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE
A PARTY LINE VOTE, IT'S GOING TO
BE 11 YESES AND HOWEVER
DEMOCRATS SHOWED UP.
I THINK IF THEY'RE NOT THERE,
THEY'RE RECORDED AS NOT PRESENT
UNLESS THEY SENT A PROXY VOTE
AND I DON'T KNOW IN THE CASE OF
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE THEY
CAN DO THAT.
YOU'RE TESTING MY KNOWLEDGE OF
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RULES.
I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D HAVE TO GET
INTO IT.
>> I'M SORRY.
>> SUCH AS THE TIMES WE LIVE IN.
>> I'M SORRY EVERY QUESTION I
USUALLY COME AT YOU, YOU COME
BACK WITH A GREAT ANSWER.
>> WE HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE
BARREL.
ED O'KEEFE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> WE'RE GOING TO HEAD BACK
INTO THE COMMITTEE ROOM NOW.
SENATOR LEHI IS TALKING.
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S DEFIANT AND
EVASIVENESS, VEHEMENT ATTACKS IN
THEHE FACE OF POWERFUL AND WILL
INCRIMINATING TESTIMONY
SURPASSING THAT OF CLARENCE
THOMAS AND ANITA HILL.
HE TRIED TO PORTRAY DR. FORD'S
ALLEGATION AS PART OF A
CALCULATION K ISOLATED AND
ORCHESTRATED -- CALCULATED AND
ORCHESTRATED HIT.
PEOPLE TRY TO BLAME THE VICTIM,
NOT TO OWN UP TO THEIR OWN
DEEDS.
HE ANGLY ASSERTED BAYLESS
POLITICAL TIRADES AND WAS ALL
TOO EAGER TO PROMOTE THE TALKING
POINT SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS
LYING IN WAIT WITH THIS
ALLEGATION AND CLAIMED THE
ALLEGATIONS WERE DRIVEN BY
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE
CLINTONS.
IT'S HARD TO MAKE THIS STUFF UP.
THAT AMOUNTS TO CONSPIRTORYIAL
MADNESS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH VOLATILITY,
PARTISAN SHIP AND LACK OF
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT FROM ANY
NOMINEE, ANY COURT, IN ANY
ADMINISTRATION.
THERE IS NO SECRET THAT I'M
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT JUSTICE
KAVANAUGH WOULD MEAN FOR THE
WRITINGS OF WOMEN, FOR WORKERS,
FOR UNCHECKED PRESIDENTIAL POWER
AND OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES.
I ALSO BELIEVE HE'S UNFIT TO
SERVE ON OUR NATION'S HIGHEST
COURT BECAUSE OF HIS HISTORY OF
MISLEADING THE SENATE WHILE
UNDER OATH.
BUT AS SERIOUS AS THESE CONCERNS
ARE, THIS IS DIFFERENT.
VOTING TO ADVANCE AND ULTIMATELY
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHILE
HE'S UNDER THIS DARK CLOUD OF
SUSPICION, WILL FOREVER CHANGE
THIS SENATE AND OUR NATION'S
HIGHEST COURT.
HE POLITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT
WHICH SHOULD BE ABOVE POLITICS
AND FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL
VIOLENCE STRUGGLING TO COME
FORWARD, THE CONSEQUENCES MAY BE
EVEN WORSE.
EVERY ONE OF US WHO HAS BEEN A
PROSECUTOR HAS SEEN HOW HARD IT
IS SOMETIMES FOR VICTIMS TO COME
FORWARD AND ARE WE SENDING THE
SIGNAL THAT YOU STAY THERE,
DON'T COME FORTH?
YOU KNOW HOW THIS COMMITTEE
HANDLE THIS IS NOMINATION WILL
BE VIEWED AS A REFLECTION OF OUR
SERIOUSLY OUR SOCIETY VIEWS
CREDIBLE CLAIMS OF SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT.
DURING DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY, THE
NATIONAL SEXUAL HOTLINE SAW AN
UNPRECEDENTED 147% INCREASE IN
CALLS.
WHEN SURVIVORS SEE US TAKING
SEXUAL ASSAULT SERIOUSLY,
THEY'RE EMPOWERED TO COME
FORWARD.
IF THEY SEE US CAL USUALLY
SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG I FEEL
THEY'LL HAVE DISASTERS,
CONSEQUENCES.
IF VICTIMS THINK THEY'LL NEVER
BE BELIEVED OR NOT MATTER EVEN
IF THEY ARE BELIEVED, THEN WHY
COME FORWARD AT ALL.
DR. FORD DESERVES TO BE HEARD.
AND THAT MUST MEAN MORE THAN
JUST CHECKING A BOX.
REMEMBER, DR. FORD DID NOT SPEND
HER ENTIRE LIFE PREPARING FOR
THIS MOMENT.
SHE IS NOT BACKED BY THE MOST
POWERFUL OFFICIALS IN OUR
NATION'S GOVERNMENT.
SHE DID NOT COME WITH A
POLITICAL AGENDA AND DID NOT
TESTIFY WITH A JOB PROMOTION ON
THE LINE.
SHE DID NOT EVADE OUR QUESTIONS
AND SHE DID NOT DEMEAN OUR
MOTIVES OF EITHER REPUBLICANS OR
DEMOCRATS.
SHE INSTEAD PLAINLY, WITH GRACE,
AND AT TIMES E EMOTIONALLY,
RECOUNTED THE DRAMA THAT SHE
EXPERIENCED AS A 15-YEAR-OLD
GIRL.
TRAUMA HAS BEEN HAUNTING HER FOR
THE 36 YEARS SINCE.
SHE HAD NOTHING TO GAIN,
EVERYTHING TO LOSE, BY COMING
FORWARD.
I LISTEN CLOSELY TO BOTH HER AND
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND I BELIEVE
HER AS I BELIEVED ANITA HILL.
I'LL BE VOTING NO ON JUDGE
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION.
HE DOES NOT HAVE THE VERACITY OR
TEMPERAMENT TO THE HIGHER COURT
IN OUR NATION.
AND NO SUCH NOMINEE SHOULD BE
CONFIRMED IN THE FACE OF SUCH
SERIOUS, CREDIBLE, AND
UNRESOLVED -- AND UNRESOLVED
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.
>> SENATOR GRAHAM.
>> THANK YOU.
I KNOW I'M A SINGLE WHITE MALE
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AND I'M TOLD
I SHOULD SHUT UP BUT I WILL NOT
SHUT UP IF THAT'S OKAY, BECAUSE
I GOT HERE THE SAME WAY
EVERYBODY ELSE DID.
THE PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA
VOTED FOR ME AND SENATOR SCOTT
TO BE THEIR VOICE OF MEN AND
WOMEN AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE
THEIR VOICE TODAY AND MAYBE NOT
JUST FOR SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS
GOING ON HERE.
JOE BIDEN, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
SAYING THIS ON OUR SIDE,
LISTENED TO JOE, BUT JOE WAS
RIGHT A LOT.
JOE BIDEN IS A UNIQUE GUY, IF
YOU HAD ONE LAST CONVERSATION
BEFORE YOU DIE, YOU'D WANT TO
HAVE IT WITH JOE.
YOU'D BE AROUND FOR A WHILE.
HE'S A DECENT GUY.
IF HE RUNS FOR PRESIDENT,
BE HART TO BEAT.
HE CAME TO SENATOR THURMAN'S
FUNERAL.
HE SAID I JUST LIKE THE OLD GUY.
I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM AND I
DIDN'T LIKE SOME OF THE THINGS
HE DID IN HIS LIFE, BUT WHEN I
WAS DOWN AND OUT HE WAS THERE
FOR ME.
AND TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE
OTHER SIDE, THIS WILL END AND
WE'LL SEE WHAT WE DO NEXT.
I HOPE WE CAN MUSTER THE ABILITY
TO COME FORWARD, BUT FROM
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WHERE WE FIND
OURSELVES AND HOW WE GOT HERE.
I WROTE A BOOK AND I THINK
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL IS THE ONLY
PERSON THAT READ IT.
IT WAS ONLINE AND I GOT 1% SO
I'VE HAD MY TIME TO BE
PRESIDENT.
DIDN'T GO VERY FAR
AND I LOST.
I DIDN'T THINK TRUMP WOULD WIN.
I RAN OUT OF ORANGETIVES TO
DESCRIBE ABOUT HOW I FELT -- OUT
OF ADJECTIVES AND ABOUT HOW I
FELT ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN.
HE WON AND I LOST AND HE'S
PRESIDENT AND I'LL TRY TO HELP
HIM WHERE I CAN AND SAY NO WHEN
HI MUST AND THE ELECTION'S --
SAY NO WHEN I MUST AND THE
ELECTION'S OVER FOR ME.
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL HIM YOU HAD
A CHOICE TO MAKE FOR THE SUPREME
COURT VACANCY OF JUSTICE
KENNEDY.
I THINK DID YOU A GOOD JOB, MR.
PRESIDENT.
FOR SOMEBODY WHO SUPPOSEDLY
CRAZY AND THERE IS CHAOS
EVERYWHERE, HE DID A GOOD JOB
HERE.
NOW WHY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
GORSUCH AND KENNEDY -- GORSUCH
AND KAVANAUGH?
IT'S THE KENNEDY SEEP.
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT YOU'RE NOT
PAYING MUCH ATTENTION.
GORSUCH IS AN EVEN SWAP FOR J
ANTONIN
SCALIA, BUT THIS IS THE GUY IN
THE MIDDLE THAT RISKS, KAVANAUGH
CLERKED FOR JUSTICE KENNEDY.
WOULD YOU HAVE PICKED HIM?
NO, BUT YOU LOST THE ELECTION.
AND THAT DOES HAVE CONSEQUENCES.
WHEN I SAID IT, ABOUT OBAMA
WINNING, I MEANT IT.
MERRICK GARLAND, ANTONIN SCALIA
DIES IN THE ELECTION YEAR, THE
LAST YEAR OF THE TERM OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA, THE PRIMARIES
ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY.
NOT IN 100 YEARS HAS ANYBODY
BEEN NOMINATED UNDERSTAND THAT
CIRCUMSTANCE SO I DON'T THINK I
DID ANYTHING UNFAIR TO GARLAND.
AS TO SOTOMAYOR, I WAS TOLD THEY
HATE GUNS AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THEM OFF THE COURT.
THEY HATE GUNS, ON, AND ON, AND
ON.
I TRIED TO GO BACK TO WHAT THIS
COMMITTEE USED TO DO.
THURMAN VOTED BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
AGREE WITH THEIR PHILOSOPHY, I
THINK HE SAW IN HER A QUALIFIED
PERSON AND HOT I GUESS VOTED FOR
SCALIA.
THE SAME IS TRUE.
96 AND 97 VOTES.
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
MOST OF THE NOMINEES IN THE
SUPREME COURT NEVER HAD A
HEARING.
IT WAS ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED
THEY'RE QUALIFIED AND ARE NOT
HACKS, THEY'RE GOING TO GO
FORWARD.
ELECTIONS DO MATTER.
WHEN IT COMES TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP, ELECTIONS DO MATTER.
NOW, ABOUT THE LAW, AND TO MY
FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN
PROSECUTORS.
I'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR, I'VE
BEEN A DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND I'VE
BEEN A JUDGE.
EVERY WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN
VICTIMIZED NEEDS TO BE HEARD,
COUNT ME IN A THOUSAND TIMES
OVER.
COUNT ME IN FOR THE PROPOSITION
OF EVERY ONE WOMAN WHO COMES
FORWARD, ONLY GOD KNOWS HOW MANY
WOMEN AND CHILDREN GO TO THEIR
GRAVE WITH THE ABUSE.
IF YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT, YOU
JUST DON'T KNOW THIS AREA OF
LIFE, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE
HEARD IN THE UNITED STATES.
I HAD A YOUNG MAN ACCUSED OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN I WAS IN THE
AIR FORCE AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY.
THE CASE EVENTUALLY FELL APART
AND HE ALMOST KILLED HIMSELF.
I HAD WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN GANG
RAPED AND DIDN'T WANT TO TESTIFY
BUT THEY DID, ALONG WITH
COUNSELORS, I SAT WITH THEM ALL
NIGHT.
TOUGH STUFF.
EMOTIONAL.
WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED?
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS LEGAL STUFF
MOST OF MY LIFE.
I'VE NEVER HEARD A MORE
COMPELLING DEFENSE OF ONE'S
HONOR AND SBEGITY THAN I DID
FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH.
HE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE,
EVERYBODY IN THE EYE AND HE WAS
MAD AND HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAD.
HE COULD TELL YOU WHERE HE WAS
AT AND WHAT HE WAS DOING HIGH
SCHOOL IN A WAY THAT JUST BLEW
ME AWAY.
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND WOMEN, IF
YOU'RE A GANG RAPIST IN HIGH
SCHOOL, YOU DON'T LET IT GO.
EVERYONE WOMAN WHO KNOWS BRETT
KAVANAUGH HAS COME FORWARD TO
SAY HE'S NOT THAT KIND OF GUY.
HE'S BEEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL
OFFER IS HAVE YOU, SIX FBI
INVESTIGATIONS AND WE MISSED THE
SOPHOMORE JUNIOR GANG RAPIST.
WE DIDN'T MISS IT.
IT'S A BUNCH OF GARBAGE.
WE'RE IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE AND
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY, MS.
FORD, ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT MS.
FORD, I FEEL SORRY FOR HER AND I
DO BELIEVE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO
HER AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN AND
WHERE, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT
WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH AND AS A
PROSECUTOR, YOU COULDN'T GET OUT
OF THE BATTER'S BOX BECAUSE IN
AMERICA, BEFORE YOU CAN ACCUSE
SOMEBODY OF A CRIME YOU HAVE TO
TELL THEM WHEN IT HAPPENED AND
WHERE IT HAPPENED AND YOU HAVE
TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE
DOUBT IT DID HAPPEN.
THE REASON THIS CASE WILL NEVER
BE BROUGHT IN MARYLAND OR
ANYWHERE ELSE, YOU JUST CAN'T
GET THERE.
IF YOU WANTED TO GET A WARRANT,
WHICH IS A PROXIMATE CAUSE
STANDARD TO SEARCH OR ARREST
SOMEONE -- PROBABLY CAUSE,
YOU -- PROBALBLE CAUSE WHERE AND
WHEN IT HAPPENED.
AT THIS TIME BURDEN ON YOU TO
PROVE YOU WERE NOT AT A PARTY
35 YEARS AGO AND WON'T TELL YOU
WHERE OR WHEN IT WAS?
SO ALL THE I CAN SAY IS UNDER
ANY REASONABLE STANDARD, ANY
CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, THIS
WOULD NOT GO FORWARD.
THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE ALLEGATIONS
HERE.
THE FIFTH ALLEGATION WAS BROUGHT
TO ME BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE WHO
DID ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING.
SOMEBODY CONTACTED HIM IN RHODE
ISLAND AND SAID, A FRIEND OF HIS
WAS ON A BOAT WITH MARK JUDGE
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH AND TREATED
HER BAT BODILY.
HE WENT DOWN AND BEAT HIM UP AND
SHE WON'T COME FORWARD.
I SAID I'LL MAKE SURE, I'LL JOIN
WITH YOU, LET THE FBI LOOK AT
IT, AND TURNED OUT NOT TO BE
TRUE.
THE FOURTH ALLEGATION WAS AN
ANONYMOUS ALLEGATION, ALERT ARE
WITHOUT A DATE OR RETURN ADDRESS
SENT TO CORY GARDNER JUST A FEW
DAYS AGO AND HE TURNED IT OVER
TO THE COMMITTEE AND SOMEBODY
LEAK TODAY TO NBC NEWS AND IT
MADE IT ON THE -- LEAKED IT ON
THE NEWS AND MADE IT ON THE
NEWS, THE FOURTH ALLEGATION.
THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE BUT THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
IT WAS SOMEBODY OVER THERE.
NOW ABOUT MS. FORD I FEEL REALLY
BAD SHE WANTED TO REMAIN
ANONYMOUS AND COULD NOT.
THE ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE IS
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WOULD NOT DO
THIS AND DID NOT DO THIS.
I KNOW FOR SURE SOMEBODY DID.
IT WASN'T SHATTER FROM A FRIEND.
THREE GROUPS HAD THIS LETTER
THAT WAS REQUESTED TO BE
ANONYMOUS.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND HER STAFF,
THE CONGRESSWOMAN FROM
CALIFORNIA AND HER STAFF, AND
THE LAWYERS.
SOMEBODY BETRAYED HER TRUST, AND
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY YOU
SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING.
TO DELAY THIS HEARING, TO SET IN
MOTION THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS
MAN TO KEEP THIS SEAT OPEN PAST
THE ELECTION.
THAT I KNOW BEYOND ANY, ANY
DOUBT.
WHAT ELSE DO I KNOW?
ABOUT FELL OUT OF MY CHAIR WHEN
DR. FORD SAID YESTERDAY, I
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WOULD BE WILLING
TO COME TO ME.
THE E-MAIL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN
THIS COMMITTEE AND HER LAWYERS,
MY STAFF WOULD STILL WELCOME THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH DR.
FORD AT ANY TIME, ANYPLACE
CONVENIENT TO HER.
COME TO US OR WE TO YOU AND I'M
WILLING TO HAVE MY STAFF TRAVEL
TO DR. FORD IN CALIFORNIA OR
ANYWHERE ELSE TO OBTAIN HER
TESTIMONY SEPTEMBER 19th.
WELL, THAT WOULDN'T FIT IN THE
PLAN.
IT WOULDN'T BE PUBLIC, AND IT
WOULD GET OVER WITH SOONER THAN
PEOPLE WANTED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE BUT
I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT DR. FORD
DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS
INVITATION.
AND I'VE BEEN A LAWYER MOST OF
MY ADULT LIFE AND SOMEBODY NEEDS
TO ASK THE QUESTION, TO HER
LAWYERS, HOW COULD SHE NOT KNOW
ABOUT THIS.
ARE YOU BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A VERY
LONG TIME IN THIS CASE, IT'S NOT
THAT HARD TO FIGURE OUT.
SO IF THIS IS THE NEW STANDARD,
THE ACCUSATION PROVES ITSELF TO
THOSE WHO WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS,
YOU HATE WOMEN, GOT HELP US ALL.
IF THE NEW STANDARD FOR THE
COMMITTEE, IS THERE IS NO
PRESUMPTION OF ANYTHING, THAT
YOU HAVE TO PROVE WHY SOMEBODY
OULD ACCUSE YOU, NOI
DIDN'T DO IT AND HERE'S WHY I
DIDN'T DO IT BUT YOU HAVE TO
PROVE THE MOTIVES OF YOUR
ACCUSER.
GOD HELP US ALL.
THE MICHAEL AVENATTI MOMENT,
TELLS YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
IF WE KEEP THIS FORCE GOING.
PLENTY OF TIME, PLENTY OF
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET TO THE
TRUTH.
THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE
TRUTH.
THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT DELAY AND
DESTRUCTION, AND IF WE REWARD
THIS, IT IS THE END OF GOOD
PEOPLE WANTING TO BE JUDGES, IT
IS THE END OF WANTING ANY
CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS
THAT WILL TEAR THIS COUNTRY
APART.
AND IF I AM CHAIRMAN, NEXT YEAR,
IF WE KEEP THE MAJORITY AND
SENATOR GRASSLEY MOVES OVER, AND
I HOPE HE DOESN'T BECAUSE I
THINK HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB.
I'M GOING TO REMEMBER THIS.
THERE IS THE PROCESS BEFORE
KAVANAUGH AND THE PROCESS AFTER
KAVANAUGH.
IF YOU WANT TO VET THE NOMINEE,
YOU CAN.
IF YOU WANT TO DELAY THINGS FOR
THE NEXT ELECTION, YOU WILL NOT.
IF YOU TRY TO DESTROY SOMEBODY
YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH IT.
JEFF IS LEAVING.
HE HAS WRESTLED WITH THIS.
HE'S TRYING TO BE FAIR.
I CANNOT TELL YOU, JEFF, WHAT
HAPPENED 35 YEARS AGO.
I CAN TELL YOU THIS, THAT
THROUGH ANY LEGAL SYSTEM, THIS
THING WOULD NOT GET OUT OF THE
BATTER'S BOX AND THAT EVERYTHING
I KNOW ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH
SCREAMS THAT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN.
AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS SO
TO MY GOOD FRIEND, FRIENDS ON
THE OTHER SIDE WHO ARE
STRUGGLING, I THINK AN FBI
INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO DO
NOTHING.
IT'S NOT GOING TO TELL KNEW MORE
THAN WE KNOW NOW.
IT'S GOING TO JUST KEEP IT
GOING, AND GOING, AND GOING
UNTIL HE BREAKS UNTIL THE NEXT
FIVE COME FORWARD.
I'M GOING TO VOTE YES.
AND I'M GOING TO TELL HIS TWO
DAUGHTERS THAT I'M PROUD OF YOUR
DAD AND I REALLY, REALLY BELIEVO
TELL DR. FORD I'M SORRY YOU HAD
TO GO THROUGH THIS, TOO.
>> SENATOR DURBIN.
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.
THURSDAY WAS A HISTORIC DAY IN
THE SENATE COMMIT WE MORE THAN
ITS FAIR SHARE OF HISTORY AND IN
OUR DELIBERATIONS OVER THE
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH WE
HAVE CONFRONTED SOME OF THE MOST
SERIOUS CHARGES EVER LEVELED
AGAINST A NOMINEE.
THOSE CHARGES WERE MADE AT A
MOMENT IN THE NATION'S HISTORY
WHEN WE WERE LIVING THROUGH
CULTURAL REVOLUTION.
WOMEN IN AMERICA ARE NOT ONLY
EMERGING INTO MORE AND MORE
POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY,
THEY ARE NOW AIRING GRIEVANCES
OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ABUSE
AT EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY,
CAUGHT IN THE VORTEX OF THIS
CULTURAL SHIFT, THERE IS NOT A
PERSON IN THIS ROOM WHO CAN
TRULY MEASURE THE TRAJECTORY OR
ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS
HISTORIC CHANGE.
AMERICA IS MARCHING FORWARD IN
THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE FOR WOMEN
IN THIS COUNTRY.
SADLY, MANY ON THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ARE STILL
MIRED IN THE DEAD SPACE IT WAS
27 YEARS AGO DURING THE CLARENCE
THOMAS HEARING.
YESTERDAY IN THIS ROOM, AMERICA
SAW THIS INFLAMMATORY ISSUE IN
REAL TIME IN REAL LIFE.
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS
CREDIBLE, COOPERATIVE, AND
RESOLUTE.
WHEN I ASKED HER DIRECTLY UNDER
OATH, THE DEGREE OF THE
CERTAINTY THAT SHE HAD SHE WAS
ASSAULTED BY BRETT KAVANAUGH,
SHE RESPONDED "100%", WHEN THE
PROSECUTOR ON THE REPUBLICAN
SIDE TRY TO WAVE A POLITICAL
CONSPIRACY, OR MAKE HER A TOOL
OVER LIARS, IT FELL FLAT.
THIS WOMAN WHO IDENTIFIED BRETT
KAVANAUGH AS HER ASSAILANT TO
HER HUSBAND AND THERAPIST SIX
YEARS AGO BELIEVED SHE HAD A
RESPONSIBILITY AS A CITIZEN --
AS A CITIZEN TO COME FORWARD AND
TELL HER STORY.
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE WORDS SHE
USED DURING THE COURSE OF HER
TESTIMONY YESTERDAY, THE WORD
SHE USED MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WAS
"HELPFUL."
SHE WANTED TO BE HELPFUL TO THIS
IN
COMMITTEE AND.
I BELIEVE HER.
SHE WAS AFRAID FOR HER FAMILY
AND CONFIDED IN HER COLLEAGUE,
DIANNE FEINSTEIN, WITH THE CLEAR
UNDERSTANDING I DID KNOW WOULD
PROTECT HER IDENTITY AND I HAVE
NO DOUBT THAT DIANE ACCEPTED
THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND KEPT HER
WORD.
YESTERDAY TWO MEMBERS OF THIS
COMMIT LEVELED PERSONAL ATTACKS
AT SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND SAID
SHE CONCEALED HER LETTER FOR
PARTISAN REASONS AND ONE WENT SO
FAR TO SAY SHE LEAKED THE
CONTENTS OF THAT LETTER OR HER
STAFF TO THE PRESS.
PERHAPS IN THIS TRUMPIAN ERA,
THOSE SOUTH CAROLINAS OF
BASELESS CHARGES ARE TO BE
EXACTED BUT IF WE DESCEND TO
THIS LEVEL OF POLITICAL
DISCOURSE WE HAVE FORSAKEN THE
TRADITIONS OF SENATE AND THE
COMEDY, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO
OUR PUBLIC SERVICE AND FOR THE
RECORD, THIS BASELESS CLAIM WAS
REFUTED IMMEDIATELY BY THE
INTERSEPT, WHICH WAS FIRST TO
PUBLISH THE STORY ABOUT DR.ÃºFOR.
THEIR REPORTER SAID LAST NIGHT
AND I QUOTE, FEINSTEIN'S STAFF
DID NOT LEAK THE LETTER TO THE
INTERSEPT.
YESTERDAY, DR. FORD MADE THE
PENALTY DECISION TO TELL HER
STORY PUBLICLY.
SHE CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE
UNDERNEATH AND VOLUNTEERED TO
ANSWER EVERY QUESTION.
NONE OF THE REPUBLICANS ON THIS
COMMITTEE WERE WILLING TO
QUESTION OR CONFRONT HER, NOT
ONE.
THEY SAT SILENT AS THEIR
PROSECUTOR MS. MITCHELL TRIED TO
DO THE WORK.
IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY, LAST
NIGHT ON A TV SHOW ONE SENATOR
SAID AND I QUOTE, MS. FORD HAS
GOT A PROBLEM, AND DESTROYING
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S LIFE WON'T FIX
HER PROBLEM.
HOW COULD YOU LISTEN TO HER
HONEST AND DIRECT TEST TIMONY.
LOOKING AT HIS FRIENDS TO GAYER
AND SUPPORT HIM, ONE COULD NOT
HELP BUT FEEL AS OUR COLLEAGUE
SENATE THE SENATOR FLAKE
REMINDED US IS THIS IS DEEPLY
PERSONAL AND THERE IS MANNER TO
RECONCILE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
LEDGER.
I CAN FEEL THE INTENSITY OVER
WHAT HE'S EXPERIENCED DURING THE
LAST FEW WEEKS BUT I COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND HOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH
COULD SAY THAT HE QUOTE NO NO
ILL WILL TOWARDS DR. FORD AND
CALLED HER CHARGES A CALCULATED,
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT,
CITING APPARENT PENT UP ANGER
ABOUT THE 2016 ELECTION AND
QUOTE REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE
CLINTONS.
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE
CLINTONS.
THIS LOCK HER UP GRACE NOTE IN
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S REMARKS MAY
HAVE RAISED A CHEER IT UP MOMENT
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE EXCHANGE I HAD WAS AN HONEST
EFFORT TO LOOSE THE GOURDIAN
KNOT THIS COMMITTEE FACES WHEN
TWO SWORN WITNESSES ARE IN
CONDITION.
WHAT I ASKED FOR, WHAT MANY HAVE
ASKED FOR, IS OBVIOUS.
TURN OVER THE FAX THE WE KNOW TO
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF
INVESTIGATION.
LET THEM CONNECT THE DOTS, LET
THEM COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION,
THEN LET US MEET AND EVALUATE
THEIR FINDINGS.
DO YOU REMEMBER YESTERDAY?
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE
REPUBLICANS MADE A POINT OF
QUOTING THE AMERICAN BAR
ASSOCIATION?
MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD LIKE
PERMISSION TO ENTER INTO THE
RECORD A LETTER FROM SENT TO
THIS COMMITTEE ON SEPTEMBER
27th, 2018 BY THE AMERICAN BAR
ASSOCIATION.
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION, LET ME
READ IT.
>> AS APPROPRIATE, THE FULL
SENATE WILL CONDUCT A
CONFIRMATION VOTE ON JUDGE
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION ONLY
AFTER AN APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND
CHECK IN THE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY
PROFESSOR FORD AND OTHERS IS
COMPLETED BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU
OF INVESTGATION.
WE MAKE THIS REQUEST BECAUSE OF
THE ABA'S RESPECT FOR THE RULE
OF LAW AND DUE PROCESS UNDER
LAW.
THE BASIC PRINCIPALS THAT
UNDERSCORE THE SENATE'S
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY AND CONSENT
ON FEDERAL JOOULD IGDSIAL
JUDICIAL NOMINATION
REQUIRE NOTHING BUT THE FACTS BY
THE FBI.
AS WITH ALL OTHERS, IT'S SIMPLY
TOO IMPORTANT TO RUSH TO A VOTE.
DECIDING TO PROCEED WITHOUT
CONDUCTING ADDITIONAL
INVESTIGATION WOULD NOT ONLY
HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THE
SENATE'S REPUTATION, BUT IT WILL
ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE GREAT
TRUST NECESSARY FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE TO HAVE IN THE SUPREME
COURT.
IT MUST REMAIN AN CONSTITUTION
THAT'LL RELIABLY FOLLOW THE LAW
AND NOT POLITICS.
RESPECTFULLY, THE SENATE SHOULD
RECOGNIZE THAT A THUGT ROW FBI
INVESTIGATION WILL DEMONSTRATE
ITS COMMITMENT TO A SUPREME
COURT THAT IS ABOVE REPROACH.
THAT LETTER WAS SIGNED BY ROBERT
CARLSON, PRESIDENT OF THE
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.
ALL OF THE QUOTES YES ABOUT THE
ABA'S FINDING ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH
ARE A DISTANT SECOND TO WHAT
WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE SAME ORG
ZAGDS TO DO AND IT IS NOT AN
UNREASONABLE REQUEST.
WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH?
TWO SWORN WITNESSES IN DIRECT
CONTRADICTION, BUT THERE IS ONE
CONTDIGDS.
ONE OF THESE SWORN WITNESSES HAS
STEPPED FORWARD AND SAID I WOULD
SUBMIT MY TEST SKBRN I MONY AND
MYSELF TO THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF
INVESTIGATION, UNDERSTANDING
ANYONE WHO DIES TO THE FEDERAL
BUREAU IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL
PROSECUTION.
THE OTHER WITNESS EVADED THAT
QUESTION OVER AND OVER AND OVER.
OH, I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO THE
COMMITTEE, IT'S UP TO THE
CHAIRMAN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DECIDE ON THAT, YOU MAKE THAT
DECISION.
JUDGE KAVANAUGH KNOWS BETTER.
HE KNOWS IF HE HAD TURNED
YESTERDAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE
COUNSEL AND SAID SUSPEND THIS
UNTIL WE HAVE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR MY NAME,
MY REPRESENTATION AND MY
NOMINATION TO THIS COURT IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE
THOSE SCALES HAVE BEEN TIPPED IN
FAVOR OF THE ONE SWORN WITNESS
WHO WAS WILLING TO TAKE HER CASE
BEFORE THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF
INVESTIGATION, I'LL BE VOTING NO
ON THE NOMINATION OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH TO THE SUPREME COURT.
>> BEFORE I CALL ON SENATOR
CORNYN, SINCE THE ABA LETTER
CAME UP, I HAVE THIS COMMENT,
THAT PRESIDENT OF THE ABA CALLED
FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION AS YOU
JUST HEARD AND TO DO IT BEFORE A
VOTE.
I'VE EXPLAINED MANY TIMES
ANOTHER FBI INVESTIGATION IS NOT
NECESSARY.
THE ABA IS AN OUTSIDE
ORGANIZATION LIKE ANY OTHER THAT
CAN SEND US LETTERS AND SHARE
THEIR ADVICE, BUT WE'RE NOT
GOING TO LET THEM DICTATE OUR
COMMITTEE'S BUSINESS.
ALSO, THIS LETTER IS FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE ABA.
ONE SIDE, HE DOESN'T REPRESENT
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
LAWYERS IN THE UNITED STATES.
IT ISN'T AT ALL CLEAR THAT ABA
PRESIDENT HAS AUTHORITY TO SPEAK
FOR THE ORGANIZATION ON THIS
MATTER.
THIS LETTER DOESN'T SAY HE
CONFERRED WITH ANYONE ELSE OR
CONVENED THE QUALITICASION
COMMITTEE BY CONFERENCE CALL OR
OTHERWISE, DOESN'T REITERATE THE
FACT JUDGE KAVANAUGH RECEIVED A
VERY WELL QUALIFIED RATING FROM
THE ABA STANDING COMMITTEE ON
THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, AND THE
STANDING COMMITTEE DID NOT JOIN
THIS LETTER.
SENATOR CORNYN.
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.
I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT I BELIEVE
THAT IN CONSIDERING DR. FORD'S
TESTIMONY WE SHOULD TREAT HER
THE SAME WAY I WOULD WANT MY
WIFE, MY DAUGHTERS, OR MY MOTHER
TREATED IF THEY WERE IN SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES.
CONVERSELY, I WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE TREAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH THE
SAME WAY WE WOULD TREAT MY
FATHER, MY BROTHER, OR A SON.
WE OWE THAT TO BOTH JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AND TO DR. FORD.
IT IS SIMPLY FALSE TO SAY THAT
SOMEHOW WE HAVE IN DRAWING
ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS
HAS BEEN AN ORCHESTRATED EFFORT
TO DELAY THE VOTE ON THIS
NOMINATION, THAT WE HAVE SOMEHOW
BEEN DISRESPECTFUL OF DR. FORD.
I'M PROUD OF THE WAY THIS
COMMITTEE TREATED DR. FORD
YESTERDAY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE,
DIGNIFIED, AND APPARENTLY OUR
FRIENDS ACROSS THE AISLE ARE
SOMEHOW UPSET WE GOT A TRAINED
LAWYER WHO HANDLES CLAIMS LIKE
THIS ON A DAILY BASIS, TO HANDLE
IT IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY TO ELICIT
FACTS AND INFORMATION FROM DR.
FORD.
>> IT IS SIMPLY TRYING TO TAKE 
OUR I OFF THE BALL. 
IT HAS BEEN A QUICKWITTED 
EFFORT TO MANIPULATE THIS 
PROCESS IN A WAY THAT IS UNFAIR 
TO DR. FORD  AND TO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH.  
AND THAT IS SHAMEFUL. 
I SAID YESTERDAY I THINK THIS 
IS ONE OF THE DARKEST DAYS FOR 
THE UNITED STATE S SENATE SINCE 
THE McCARTHY HEARINGS IN THE 
50s. 
YOU MAY RECALL THE COMMENTS OF 
ONE OF THE LAWYERS WHO SAID, I 
NEVER REALLY GAUGED YOUR CRUELTY
OR RECKLESSNESS BEFORE TODAY. 
AND ASKED, DO YOU HAVE NO SENSE 
OF DECENCY? 
I THINK THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN 
CRUEL AND RECKLESS AND INDECENT 
FOR BOTH DR. FORD  AND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH . AND IT DID NOT HAVE 
TO BE THAT WAY. 
WHEN WE LEARNED YESTERDAY FROM 
DR. FORD  THAT SHE DID NOT 
AUTHORIZE THE RELEASE OF THE 
LETTER OF JULY 30 THAT SHE SENT 
TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN, SHE DID 
NOT AUTHORIZE IT, SHE DID NOT 
WANT IT LEAKED, BUT IT WAS 
LEAKED. 
AND SHE SAID THE ONLY PEOPLE 
THAT HAD POSSESSION OF WITH 
WERE HER LA, SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN, AND REPRESENTATIVE --
THE LETTER HAD TO COME FROM 
SUMMER WHEN SHE TESTIFIED SHE 
WAS NOT INFORMED OF GERMAN 
GRASSLEY'S -- GERMAN GRASSLEY'S 
INTERVIEW WITH BIPARTISAN 
PARTICIPATION ABOUT HER CLAIMS, 
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T -- IT 
WASN'T CLEAR THAT OFFER HAD 
EVER BEEN MADE. 
SO ONE THE LETTER WAS LEAKED BY 
SOMEBODY, WHEN THE OFFER TO 
INTERVIW HER BEFORE A PANEL OF 
INVESTIGATORS AT A PLACE AND 
TIME OF HER CHOOSING, OUT OF 
THE PUBLIC EYE, -- WHEN THAT 
WAS NOT COMMUNICATED, IT SURE 
LOOKS TO ME TO THE DESIRE TO 
HAVE WHAT WE HAD YESTERDAY. 
AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT HAS 
ONLY BEEN DESCRIBED AS A CIRCUS 
ATMOSPHERE. 
CRUEL, RECKLESS, NO SENSE OF 
DECENCY. I WOULD POINT TO THE 
FACT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH  SAID 
AS LONG AS THIS NOMINATION HAS 
BEEN PENDING, YOU HAVE SEEN IT 
TREND TOWARDS MORE AND MORE 
SCURRILOUS, SALACIOUS, AND ON 
COOPERATED ALLEGATIONS BEING 
MADE AGAINST HIM. 
ALL OF WHICH THE CHAIRMAN AND 
THE COMMITTEE, PROFESSIONAL 
STAFF HAVE ATTEMPTED TO 
INVESTIGATE. WE HEARD FROM DR. 
FORD . WE ALSO SAW A CLAIM BY A 
MISS RAMIREZ THAT WAS ON 
COOPERATED BY THE DOZENS OF 
WITNESSES THAT ALLEGEDLY EXISTED
. THE NEW YORK TIMES COULD NOT 
CONFIRM THAT. 
NOBODY WOULD CONFIRM HER 
ALLEGATION. AND THEN YESTERDAY 
THE RANKING MEMBER QUOTED FROM 
SOME OF THE CLAIMS. 
REPRESENTATIVE -- REPRESENTED 
BY MICHAEL AVENATTI, AND I WAS 
STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT SOME OF 
THE ALLEGATIONS MADE IN THE 
STATEMENT THAT WE GOT ON 
SEPTEMBER 25 2018, ACCUSED MARK 
JUDGE AND BRENT KAVANAUGH TO 
GANG RAPE  HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS AT 
A TIME WHEN SHE WAS IN COLLEGE 
AND SAYS SHE WENT BACK TO 
PARTIES IN HIGH SCHOOL NOT ON 
ONE OCCASION, NOT AN TWO 
OCCASIONS. SHE WENT TO 10 SUCH 
PARTIES I AM SHOCKED THAT 
COLLEAGUES WOULD EMBRACE THIS 
KIND OF ON COOPERATED, 
OUTRAGEOUS, SALACIOUS ALLEGATION
CONSIDERING THE FACTS AND THE 
TIMING AND THE REPRESENTATION 
BY STORMY DANIELS'S LAWYER. 
HE'S OBVIOUSLY EAGER FOR MORE 
PUBLIC ATTENTION AND NOTORIETY. 
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT IN THE 
QUOTE FROM THE RANKING MEMBER 
YESTERDAY WHEN SHE QUOTED FROM 
SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY 
MS. SWETNICK.  
OUR FRIEND SAID THE INTEGRITY 
OF THE SENATE IS ON TRIAL. 
I AGREE WITH THAT. 
AND WE ARE FAILING BADLY. 
CRUELTY, RECKLESSNESS, INDECENCY
TOWARDS THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD BE 
TREATING WITH RESPECT AND 
DIGNITY. THAT EXTENDS TO MARK 
JUDGE. ISN'T IT OBVIOUS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING HERE WITH MARK JUDGE? 
HE SAYS -- HAS SUBMITTED A 
STATEMENT UNDER ENTITY OF 
PENALTIES SAYING THAT BRENT 
KAVANAUGH AND I WERE FRIENDS IN 
HIGH SCHOOL BUT WE NEVER -- 
HAVE NOT SPOKEN IN YEARS. 
I DO NOT RECALL THE EVENTS. HE 
SUBMITTED THAT STATEMENT 
YESTERDAY. 
SHE SAID I NEVER SAW BRETT ACT 
IN THE MATTER THAT DR. FORD 
DESCRIBES. 
I AM SUBMITTING THIS UNDER 
PENALTY OF PENALTY. 
HE SAYS HE HAS NOTHING MORE TO 
OFFER. 
HE SUBMITTED THE STATEMENT UNDER
PENALTY OF FELONY. 
HERE IS THE OTHER PART -- HE 
ADMITS TO BEING A RECOVERING 
ALCOHOLIC. 
AS WELL AS A CANCER SURVIVOR. 
HE SAID HE STRUGGLES WITH 
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SO MUCH 
THAT HE AVOIDS PUBLIC SPEAKING 
OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE 
BELIEVE THE APPROPRIATE COURSE 
OF CONDUCT IS TO DRAG MR. JUDGE 
INTO THIS CIRCUS LIKE ATMOSPHERE
AND TO SUBJECT HIS BATTLE WITH 
ALCOHOLISM AND ADDICTION TO 
PUBLIC INVESTIGATION AND 
SCRUTINY AND CRITICAL -- 
RIDICULE. 
THAT IS CRUEL. 
THAT IS RECKLESS. THAT IS 
INDECENT. 
SO MR. CHAIRMAN, IN CONCLUSION, 
I BELIEVE THIS IS A QUICKWITTED 
EFFORT TO DELAY THE VOTE. 
I THINK THE EVIDENCE ALL POINTS 
TO THAT. 
AND THE LONGER WE GO WITHOUT 
VOTING, IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT 
PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL AVENATTI 
AND OTHERS EAGER TO GET 
ATTENTION AND WILLING TO HELD 
THE MOST SALACIOUS ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST THIS NOMINEE THAT WAY 
-- WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE THE 
SAME. 
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ABOUT 150 
NOMINATIONS ARE PENDING ON THE 
SENATE CALENDAR. 
IF THERE IS BEEN ONE THING THAT 
HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES CONDUCT CROSS THE 
AISLE DURING THE TIME OF THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TO 
OBSTRUCT, DELAY, AND DENY THIS 
ADMINISTRATION THE BENEFIT OF 
THE NOMINEES WHICH THEY HAVE 
SENT TO THE SENATE FOR ADVICE 
AND CONSENT. 
THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY JUDGES 
BUT ALL ASPECTS OF THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT. 
150 NOMINATIONS BENNETT -- 
PENDING ON THE CALENDAR BECAUSE 
THEY WANT TO OBSTRUCT, DELAY, 
AND DELIGHT THE ADMINISTRATION 
THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE THEY 
HAVE CHOSEN TO HELP GOVERN. 
SO IT STRIKES ME AS ENTIRELY 
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE 
SEEN ON THIS NOMINATION. 
AND I THINK IT IS DISGRACEFUL 
AS SENATOR HATCH SAID YESTERDAY
,  I THINK THE WAY DR. FORD  
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH  HAVE BEEN 
TREATED IS A SCANDAL AND IT IS 
CRUEL, RECKLESS, AND INDECENT. 
>> SENATOR. 
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. 
I WILL BE FAIRLY BRIEF BECAUSE 
I ANNOUNCE -- ANNOUNCED BY 
ATTENTION TO VOTE AGAINST 
KAVANAUGH ALREADY.  
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS AN 
UNPLEASANT RECORD BOTH OF 
ASSOCIATIONS WITH AND RULINGS 
FOR A POWERFUL ARRAY OF ACTIVIST
REPUBLICAN SPECIAL INTERESTS. 
TO WHOM HE GIVES IN 90% WIN RATE
-- THE SUPREME COURT HAS AN 
EQUALLY UNPLEASANT RECORD I'VE 
5 TO 4 RULINGS FOR THE SAME BIG 
INTERESTS. 
NOT THREE OR FOUR TIMES, NOT 
EVEN ONE OR TWO DOZEN TIMES, 
BUT UNDER CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS,
70 TIMES. 
ALL 5 TO 4 PARTISAN DECISIONS. 
THE COURT IS FLYING ALL THE 
WARNING FLAGS OF A CAPTURED 
AGENCY, DANCING TO SPECIAL 
INTEREST TUNES, AND RAM 
PAINTINGS -- RAMPAGING THROUGH 
PRESIDENT AND PRINCIPAL TO GET 
THERE. 
THIS WILL BE A DISASTER FOR THE 
COURT AND I BELIEVE KAVANAUGH 
WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THAT 
DISASTER.  
HIS PARTNER SAID -- PARTISAN 
SCREED YESTERDAY WAS TELLING. 
AS TO YESTERDAY, LET ME BE 
FRANK, I BELIEVE DR. FORD.  
I MAY BE WRONG. 
BUT I BELIEVED HER. 
AND I BELIEVE KAVANAUGH  DODGE 
-- DODGED, RANTED AND RAVED, 
FILIBUSTERED, AND PREVARICATE 
IT. 
I DID NOT FIND HIM CREDITABLE. 
I DON'T BELIEVE HIS FLATULENCE, 
I DON'T BELIEVE A DOUBLE 
TRIANGLE IS A DRINKING CAME, 
AND I DON'T BELIEVE CALLING 
YOURSELF A GIRLS ALUMNI US IS 
BEING HER FRIEND. 
AND I THINK DRINKING UNTIL YOU 
RALPH OR FALL OUT OF THE BUS OR 
DON'T REMEMBER THE GAME OR NEED 
TO PIECE TOGETHER YOUR MEMORY 
THE NEXT DAY IS MORE CONSISTENT 
WITH DR. FORD 'S AND OTHERS 
TESTIMONY THAN HIS OWN. 
IF DR. FORD'S  TESTIMONY IS 
TRUE, I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE 
KAVANAUGH  HAS NO BUSINESS ON 
THE COURT. AND I FOR ONE, 
BELIEVED HER. 
BUT SET ASIDE MY OWN BELIEF, AS 
A PROSECUTOR I AM HORRIFIED AT 
WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE. 
TERMINATING THE FBI BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION BEFORE THESE NEW 
ALLEGATIONS WERE EVEN CONSIDERED
, DOING PARTISAN INTERVIEWS BY 
PARTISAN STAFFERS TO CLEARLY 
DETERMINE TO -- DECLARATIVELY 
DETERMINED TO FORCE IT THROUGH. 
LETTING THE ALLEGED ACCOMPLISH 
IN THE ASSAULT, THE GUY IN THE 
ROOM WITH HIM WHEN IT HAPPENED 
GET AWAY WITH A LAWYER'S LETTER 
AND NO TESTIMONY, NO CROSS-
EXAMINATION, THE LAWYERS WILL 
KNOW THE REVERENCE WITH WHICH 
WIGMORE IS CITED AS LEGAL 
AUTHORITY IN DECISIONS ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY AND FOR DECADES. 
BEYOND ANY DOUBT, HE WROTE, THE 
GREATEST LEGAL ENGINE EVER 
INVENTED FOR THE DISCOVERY OF 
TRUTH IS CROSS-EXAMINATION. 
MARK JUDGE IS IN HIDING INSTEAD 
OF UNDER EXAMINATION. 
THAT HAS BEEN DISABLED IN THIS 
MATTER. 
LET ME HAVE ONE EXAMPLE OF WHERE
INVESTIGATION MIGHT HELP. HERE 
IS KAVANAUGH 'S CALENDAR. 
DR. FORD SAID THAT  KAVANAUGH  
AND JUDGE AND PJ AND AT LEAST 
ONE OTHER BOY WERE ALL AT A 
HOUSE. WELL, WE KNOW KAVANAUGH 
WAS THERE.  
IT IS A SCHEDULE. 
AND HERE IS JUDGE AND HERE IS 
PJ. 
HERE ARE ALL THOSE THREE NA 
BOYS AND OTHERS AT A HOUSE 
TOGETHER, JUST AS SHE SAID. 
SHE SAID KAVANAUGH AND JUDGE 
WERE DRUNK  AND THAT SHE HAD A 
BEER. 
BREWSKIS, BEER, THEY WERE 
DRINKING. 
JUST AS SHE SAID. 
KNOW I WILL CONCEDE THAT THE 
TWO GIRLS ARE NOT MENTIONED BUT 
SPOT ME THIS, IF YOU HAD JUST 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ONE OF THE 
TWO GIRLS, WOULD YOU ADD THE 
GIRL'S NAME TO YOUR CALENDAR? 
I DOUBT IT. 
THIS MAY BE POWERFUL 
COOPERATING EVIDENCE THAT THE 
ASSAULT HAPPENED, THAT IT 
HAPPENED THAT DAY, AND THAT IT 
HAPPENED IN THAT PLACE. 
BUT WITH NO FBI INVESTIGATION, 
WE CAN'T TELL. 
THAT'S HOW YOU GET OUT OF THE 
BATTER'S BOX. 
YOU INVESTIGATE. 
IT IS THE LEAST THING A SEXUAL 
ASSAULT VICTIM IS ENTITLED TO 
WHEN SHE COMES FORWARD. 
THE FBI COULD INTERVIEW ALL THE 
ATTENDEES, NOT JUST TO OBTAIN 
SIMPLE DENIALS BUT TO CROSSCHECK
AND SEE IF THE STORIES ADD UP. 
THE FBI COULD SEE IF THE HOUSE 
MATCHES THE LOCALITY AND 
DESCRIPTION DR. FORD  GAVE. THE 
FBI COULD INQUIRE AFTER AND 
PURSUE OTHER COOPERATING OR 
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. IT IS 
WHAT THEY DO. 
ANYBODY WHO HAS DONE ANY SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION KNOWS, YOU DON'T 
STOP JUST WITH WITNESS 
STATEMENTS OF INTERESTED PARTIES
. YOU RUNDOWN COOPERATING AND 
IMPEACHING -- COOPERATING AND 
IMPEACHING EVIDENCE. 
YOU ASK AND GO BACK AGAIN. YOU 
DO THE BASIC BLOCKING AND 
INVESTIGATION. 
PARTISAN INTERVIEWS BY 
POLITICAL STAFF PRE-DETERMINED 
TO CLEAR THE NAM -- NOMINEE 
JUST AREN'T THE SAME AS REAL 
INVESTIGATORS DOING REAL 
INVESTIGATION AND COOPERATION. 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS EVER 
HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY 
OF BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. 
CLOSING OUT THE INVESTIGATION 
WITHOUT INVESTIGATING THOSE 
CRITICAL -- CREDIBLE -- THEY 
WERE CREDIBLE ENOUGH TO GET HER 
BEFORE THE SENATE AND YET SHE 
WAS NOT GIVEN THE MOST ASIC, 
DECENT -- BASIC, DECENT THINK 
THAT A WITNESS COULD BE GIVEN 
AFTER THEY COME FORWARD. 
SINCERE OR THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION. 
CLOSING OUT THE BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION WITHOUT 
INVESTIGATING NEW, CREDIBLE 
ALLEGATIONS, NOT ANY OF THREE 
ALLEGATIONS ALL FROM WOMEN 
DEMONSTRABLY IN KAVANAUGH 'S 
SOCIAL CIRCLE. 
LOOK AT THIS RIDICULOUS LETTER 
FROM THE OTHER ALLEGED SALIENT 
-- ASSAILANT IN THE ROOM. 
IT IS EQUALLY RIDICULOUS IS 
YESTERDAY'S FIG LEAF, I GUESS 
YOU WOULD CALL IT. 
THE SAME STATEMENT IS REPEATED 
WITH HIS SIGNATURE ON IT. 
AND ASK YOURSELF, DO YOU THINK 
INVESTIGATOR KAVANAUGH  WOULD 
HAVE TOLERATED LETTERS LIKE THIS
FROM THE THIRD PERSON IN THE 
ROOM HAD THERE BEEN ONE WITH 
MR. CLINTON AND MONICA LEWINSKY?
NEVER IN 1 MILLION YEARS. 
AND YET THIS IS WHAT WE ARE 
SUPPOSED TO SATISFY OURSELVES 
WITH IN THIS MATTER. 
IT IS PREPOSTEROUS TO ANYONE 
WHO HAS EVER DONE SERIOUS 
INVESTIGATION. 
YET THIS IS WHAT WE ARE LEFT 
WITH. 
WE HAVE DONE A BUNCH OF AN 
INVESTIGATION. 
OVERTIME, I EXPECT THE FACTS TO 
COME OUT. 
THEY HAVE A WAY OF DOING THAT. 
COVERUPS NEVER LAST. THE SAND IS
RUNNING THROUGH KAVANAUGH 'S 
HOURGLASS. 
I PLEDGE WHATEVER I CAN DO TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THE TRUTH OF HIS 
CONDUCT IS ULTIMATELY 
DETERMINED. 
SETTING ASIDE THIS, WE GO BACK 
TO A SUPREME COURT FAR TOO 
OFTEN DANCING TO THE TUNE OF A 
HANDFUL OF BIG REPUBLICAN 
SPECIAL INTERESTS. 
FUNDING THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 
THAT IS NOW SELECTING SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEES, BIG REPUBLICANS 
USING THE UNLIMITED DARK MONEY 
POWER THE SUPREME COURT GAVE 
THEM TO MOUNT TV AD CAMPAIGNS 
FOR SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. BIG 
REPUBLICAN SPECIAL INTEREST 
FUNDING FREQUENT FLYER -- SO-
CALLED FRIENDS OF THE COURT, 
OFFERING CONSTANT INSTRUCTION 
AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE FIVE 
REPUBLICANS ON THE SUPREME COURT
AND BIG REPUBLICAN SPECIAL 
INTERESTS ON THE WINNING SIDE 
OF THOSE 70 FIVE MAC TO 4 -- 5 
TO 4 VICTORIES. 
PEOPLE ARE CATCHING ON. THE 
RECORD OF THIS IS UNDENIABLE. 
AND AS I SAID, IT WILL BE A 
DISASTER FOR THE COURT. 
YOU HAVE MY TIME. 
>> I THINK I SHOULD TRY TO 
CLARIFY ABOUT THE CALENDAR THAT 
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE PUT UP THERE.
THE ENTRY HAS SIX BOYS LISTED 
FOR JULY 1, 1982. IT SAYS GO TO 
TIMMY'S HOUSE WITH JUDGE, TOM, 
BJ, BRADY AND -- DR. FORD SAID 
THERE WERE  FORM -- FOUR BOYS 
THERE. 
THAT IS A WRONG GATHERING. 
TWO ALLEGATIONS MADE BY MY 
COLLEAGUE ARE INCORRECT. FIRST, 
I NEVER TERMINATED AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO 
OPEN OR CLOSE AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
THE FBI CONSIDERS THIS MATTER 
CLOSED. 
IF MY COLLEAGUES WERE WORRIED 
ABOUT THE PARTISANSHIP OF THE 
INVESTIGATION THE DEMOCRATS 
COULD HAVE JOINED US AT EVERY 
STEP OF THE WAY. 
HOWEVER, WE ALL KNOW THEY 
DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE. 
SECONDLY, WE DID RECEIVE A 
LETTER SIGNED BY MARK JUDGE 
HIMSELF UNDER PENALTY OF 
PENALTY. 
I READ IT PREVIOUSLY THIS 
MORNING. 
SENATOR LEAHY. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK 
ABOUT THE NEED FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO WISH 
THAT IS WHERE THIS WOULD HAVE 
BEGUN AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEGUN. 
AS IT COULD HAVE BEGUN HAD 
THESE LETTERS BEEN HANDED OVER 
TO THE FBI WITH THE REQUEST 
THAT THEY BE INVESTIGATED AT AN 
EARLIER TIME. 
AS EARLY AS LATE JULY OR EARLY 
AUGUST -- AND LET'S TALK ABOUT 
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD 
THAT OCCURRED. 
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO DR. 
FORD  AND INTERVIEWED HER. 
A WOULD HAVE PREPARED. 
REPORT -- PREPARED A REPORT. 
THAT WOULD HAVE REFLECTED MORE 
OR LESS WHAT WE HEARD YESTERDAY.
PROBABLY A MORE DISTILLED 
VERSION OF THAT SIMILAR TO WHAT 
WE SAW IN HER WRITTEN 
STATEMENTS BEFORE SHE APPEARED 
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH .  THEY WOULD HAVE 
INTERVIEWED JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD HAVE TOLD 
US  THEN AS HE TOLD US 
YESTERDAY THAT NO SUCH EVENT 
EVER OCCURRED. HE NEVER DID 
THIS TO ANY WOMAN, NOT IN HIGH 
SCHOOL, NOT IN COLLEGE, NOT 
BEFORE, NOT AFTER. 
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE 
OTHER ALLEGED EYEWITNESSES TO 
THIS EVENT INCLUDING MARK 
JUDGE, PATRICK SMITH, AND 
LELAND KAISER. 
THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN 
STATEMENTS FROM EACH OF THEM 
AND THOSE STATEMENTS WOULD HAVE 
INDICATED AS THEY HAVE EACH 
INDICATED IN WRITTEN STATEMENTS 
SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT 
THEY RECALL NO SUCH EVENT EVER 
OCCURRING. AND SO, WE HAVE 
INVESTIGATED. 
I TOO WISH IT HAD BEEN INVESTED 
BY THE FBI. 
AND HAD IT BEEN INVESTIGATED AS 
IT COULD'VE BEEN, AS IT 
SHOULD'VE BEEN, AS IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN WHEN THESE LETTERS 
WERE RECEIVED, THIS COULD HAVE 
BEEN HANDLED IN A MORE DIGNIFIED
MANNER. 
IN A MANNER MUCH MORE 
RESPECTFUL TO DR. FORD AND  TO 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH  AND THE 
FAMILIES AND THE PROCESS. 
SOME HAVE MENTIONED TODAY THAT 
THERE WAS SOME EMOTION IN THE 
ROOM YESTERDAY. 
CERTAINLY. 
THESE ARE EMOTIONAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
MY HEART GOES OUT TO DR. FORD 
AND HER FAMILY AND  JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY.  
THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN THROUGH A 
LOT. 
I DON'T BLAME EITHER ONE OF 
THEM FOR DEMONSTRATING SOME 
EMOTION. NOT FOR A MOMENT 
HURRICANE IN THE CASE OF DR. 
FORD,  CLEARLY SHE HAS BEEN 
THROUGH SOMETHING AWFUL. 
IN THE CASE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
HE HAS SEEN  IN ADDITION TO 
THIS ALLEGATION, DRAGGING HIS 
NAME INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD, HE 
HAS SEEN HIS NAME DRAGGED 
THROUGH THE MUD ON A LOT OF 
OTHER THINGS INCLUDING AN 
ALLEGATION THAT HE WAS INVOLVED 
IN AND RUNNING A DRUG 
DISTRIBUTION AND GANG RAPE RING.
ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION IF YOU
OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE WAS ALLEGED 
TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN 
RUNNING SOMETHING LIKE THAT, 
MIGHT NOT YOU FEEL A LITTLE 
EMOTIONAL AS WELL? 
MIGHT NOT THAT SPILL INTO YOUR 
TESTIMONY IF YOU ARE CALLED IN 
FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE? 
LOOK, WE HAVE A JOB TO DO HERE 
TODAY. 
OUR JOB YESTERDAY WAS TO HEAR 
FROM DR. FORD  AND TO HEAR FROM 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
WE HAVE DONE THAT. 
OUR JOB NOW IS TO VOTE. 
TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. 
THANK, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I SAID THE FIRST DAY OF THE 
FIRST HEARING REGARDING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH  THAT THIS IS NOT 
NORMAL. IT MIGHT LOOK NORMAL. 
WE HAVE THE NOMINEE. 
WE HAVE THE FAMILY BEHIND THEM. 
YOU HAVE THE CAMERAS ON. 
IT WASN'T NORMAL. 
IT WASN'T NORMAL BECAUSE THIS 
NOMINEE WAS HANDPICKED BY A 
PRESENT WHO IN THE LAST WEEK 
HAS GONE AFTER HIS ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, THREATENED TO FIRE THE 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS 
OVERSEEING A MAJOR 
INVESTIGATION, AND NATIONAL 
SECURITY INVESTIGATION, 
HANDPICKED BY A PRESIDENT WHO 
IS UNDERMINING LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
CONSTANTLY UNDERMINING THE FBI, 
AND YET, THIS PRESIDENT 
SELECTED A NOMINEE WHO HAS THE 
MOST EXPENSIVE YOU OF EXECUTIVE 
POWER THAT WE HAVE SEEN. 
A PRESIDENT -- A VIEW OF 
EXECUTIVE POWER ACCORDING TO 
HIS WRITINGS SAY IN AN OPINION 
THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO DECLARE LAWS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN HIS OWN 
VIEWS IN LEGAL WRITINGS THAT A 
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE 
IMMUNE FROM INVESTIGATION WHILE 
SITTING IN OFFICE. 
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A SPECIAL 
COUNSEL STATUTE. 
THAT'S WHERE WE START. 
THAT'S THE CORE HERE AS WE LOOK 
AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES 
THAT WE ARE FACING. 
THE SECOND REASON THIS ISN'T 
NORMAL IS THAT WE DID NOT GET 
THE INFORMATION WE NEEDED TO 
MAKE A DECISION. 
I COME FROM A STATE THAT 
BELIEVES IN PROCESS. 
IN MY OLD JOB, I HEADED UP THE 
HENNEPIN COUNTY ATTORNEY'S 
OFFICE. 
WE HANDLED 12,000 JUVENILE 
CASES EVERY SINGLE YEAR. 
SO I SAW CASES JUST LIKE THE 
ONE WE HEARD ABOUT YESTERDAY. 
BUT I WOULD ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE 
IF WE HAD TO LET A CASE GO, IF 
WE HAD TO MAKE A DEAL THAT 
PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE, OUR ROLE 
WAS TO BE MINISTERS OF JUSTICE. 
IT WAS TO CONVICT THE GUILTY 
BUT ALSO PROTECTING THE INNOCENT
. I DON'T THINK WE PROTECTED 
THE INNOCENT VERY WELL 
YESTERDAY. 
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK 
THAT WE ARE DOING TODAY. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEST BEATING
THAT WENT ON YESTERDAY ON THE 
OTHER SIDE. 
AND IT WAS PRETTY EFFECTIVE, I 
GUESS, IF THE GOAL WAS TO 
DISTRACT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
FROM WHAT THEY HAD HEARD IN THE 
MORNING, TO DISTRACT AND DEFLECT
FROM THE MOVING, POWERFUL, 
TESTIMONY WE HEARD. 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT 
RESPECTING DR. FORD  WHEN WE 
ARE NOT GIVING HER THE RESPECT 
OF HAVING AN INVESTIGATION OF 
THE CASE THAT SHE MADE TO US 
YESTERDAY. IT WAS A WHILE AGO 
THAT THIS HAPPEN. 
THERE ARE OTHER CLAIMS OUT 
THERE AS WELL. 
BUT IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE 
AS SENATOR WHITEHOUSE 
ARTICULATED, IF YOU DON'T GO 
BACK AND LOOK AT THINGS AND YOU 
DON'T LOOK AT COOPERATING 
EVIDENCE -- COOPERATING -- 
CORROBORATING  EVIDENCE, YOU 
WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. 
THERE IS A FINITE PERIOD FOR AN 
F PI INVESTIGATION. 
-- FBI INVESTIGATION. 
GEORGE H.W. 
BUSH ORDERED THAT IN THE ANITA 
HILL CASE. 
THAT HAPPENED. 
IT'S HAPPENED. 
THAT IS NOT EVEN HAPPENING 
HERE. 
WE ARE NOT GIVING DR. FORD  THE 
RESPECT OF HAVING THAT 
INVESTIGATION. 
THAT IS WRONG. 
THAT IS NOT BEING MINISTERS OF 
JUSTICE. 
THIS WAS A WOMAN WITH NO 
POLITICAL BACKGROUND WHO MADE 
AN ATTEMPT TO CALL THE FRONT 
OFFICE OF HURT CONGRESSWOMAN. 
THAT'S WHAT SHE DID. 
SHE DID THIS BEFORE THE NOMINEE 
WAS EVEN SELECTED. SHE DID IT 
WHEN THE NOMINEE WAS ON THE 
SHORTLIST. 
SHE WAS CONCERNED. 
THAT SO SHE DID. 
DON'T ARGUE THAT SHE IS PART OF 
SOME MASSIVE POLITICAL STRATEGY.
THOSE ARE THE FACTS. 
AND YES, IT IS MESSY. 
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS MESSY. 
THINGS COME IN AT THE LAST 
MINUTE. 
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. 
IT HAPPENS BEFORE TRIAL. 
IT HAPPENS BEFORE THE HEARING. 
THE QUESTION IS NOT IF IT IS 
MESSY, SENATOR FLAKE HIMSELF 
SAID YESTERDAY, THIS IS NOT A 
GOOD PROCESS. 
BUT IT IS ALL WE'VE GOT. 
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DO YOU DO 
WHEN IT HAPPENS? 
WHEN YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF 
POWER, WHAT YOU DO WHEN IT 
HAPPENS? 
YOU MAY NOT LIKE HOW THIS CAME 
IN AT THE LAST MINUTE. 
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOWN 
ABOUT IT EARLIER TOO. 
BUT I DID NOT. 
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU DO 
WHEN IT HAPPENS? 
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS, YOU DON'T 
JUST PUT IT UNDER THE RUG. 
FOR SO MANY YEARS, THIS IS WHAT 
HAPPENED TO CLAIMS LIKE THIS. 
THEY WERE JUST SWEPT UNDER THE 
RUG. 
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOUSE, NO 
MATTER HOW BAD IT WAS DIDN'T 
BELONG IN THE COURTHOUSE. 
AND THAT HURT WOMEN AND THAT 
HER CHILDREN FOR A LONG, LONG 
TIME. 
BUT THE TIMES ARE CHANGING NOW. 
WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO MADE A 
CREDIBLE CLAIM. 
THE CHAIRMAN EVEN THANKED HER 
FOR HER BRAVERY. 
WHERE IS THE BRAVERY IN THIS 
ROOM? 
THIS RUSH, WHEN WE COULD HAVE A 
FINITE PERIOD OF TIME TO 
INTERVIEW A FINITE PERIOD OF 
WITNESSES. SOMEONE SHE ALLEGES 
WAS IN THE VERY ROOM WHERE IT 
HAPPENED. 
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CROSS-
EXAMINE THEN -- THEM OR ASK 
QUESTIONS. 
WE DON'T GET TO SAY YOU WILL GET
IN CRITICAL -- CRIMINAL TROUBLE 
IF YOU DON'T ANSWER THESE 
QUESTIONS CORRECTLY. 
THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING. 
WE HAVE A POLYGRAPH EXPERT. 
YESTERDAY, I PUT THAT EXAM ON 
THE RECORD. 
PEOPLE WERE BRISTLING OVER 
THERE. 
WE WENT TO SEE THE CHARTS. 
WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE THE 
EXPERT TESTIFY AND EXPLAIN HOW 
THIS WAS VERIFIED. 
AND YES, AS JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
POINTED OUT  THIS IS NOT A TEST 
THAT IS ADMISSIBLE IN COURT. 
GUESS WHAT? 
WE USE IT FOR JOB INTERVIEWS, 
THE FBI, THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
, THE CIA, AND THE NOMINEE 
HIMSELF HAS EVEN SAID THAT THIS 
IS USEFUL TO USE FOR THOSE 
PURPOSES IN A CASE THAT HE 
DECIDED IN 2016. 
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF WITNESSES 
WE COULD HEAR FROM IF WE HAD 
THE OPPORTUNITY, MAYBE ONE WEEK 
TO DO IT. 
I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. 
IF WE WANT TO SHOW DR. FORD 
RESPECT, WE GAVE HER THE 
RSPECT OF HAVING HER CASE 
HEARD  AND THE EVIDENCE LOOKED 
AT. 
I LOOK AT IT AS WHAT ARE YOU 
HIDING? 
WHAT WOULD IT HURT? 
IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH  IS SO SURE 
THAT HE HAS THIS CORROBORATING  
EVIDENCE AND WHAT THESE THINGS 
MEAN, WHAT IS HE AFRAID OF IF 
WE JUST SPEND ONE WEEK LOOKING 
AT THE EVIDENCE? 
WHAT I HAVE HEARD TODAY JUST 
ADDS TO THIS. WHEN I HEARD THE 
SANCTIMONIOUS TALK ABOUT 
SOMETIME -- SOME KIND OF A 
POLITICAL STRATEGY, I WILL GIVE 
YOU EXHIBIT A. YOU TALK ABOUT A 
NOMINEE GETTING OFF THE FLOOR 
WHEN ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS 
ONE WEEK FOR AN INVESTIGATION. 
AND YOU KEPT GARLAND AWAY FROM 
THIS COMMITTEE FOR 10 MONTHS. 
THAT'S NOT EVEN A COMPARISON. 
THAT WAS A STRATEGY YESTERDAY. 
BOY, IT WAS A STRATEGY. 
I HOPE THAT SOME OF THE 
SENATORS WERE NOT MADE A 
DECISION, CORE NOT ON THIS 
COMMITTEE, A LOOK AT THE 
EVIDENCE AND LOOK AT WHAT 
HAPPENED AND SEE IT FOR THE 
STRATEGY THAT IT WAS. 
I ASKED DR. FORD  YESTERDAY 
ABOUT WHAT SHE REMEMBERS FROM 
THAT NIGHT, AND I ALSO ASKED 
HER WHAT SHE COULDN'T FORGET. 
AND HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID, THE 
STAIRWELL, THE LIVING ROOM, THE 
BEDROOM, THE BED ON THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE ROOM, THE BATHROOM 
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY, THE 
LAUGHTER, THEY ARE GLORIOUS 
LAUGHTER, THE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS 
TO ESCAPE IN THE FINAL ABILITY 
TO DO SO. 
WE HEARD HER TALK ABOUT HOW SHE 
HAD A CIVIC DUTY TO BRING THIS 
UP. 
WE HEARD HER TESTIFY HOW SHE 
BROUGHT THIS UP 6 YEARS BEFORE 
TO A COUNSELOR ABOUT HOW HER 
HUSBAND RECALLS USING THE 
JUDGE'S NAME. 
IN THE RULES OF EVIDENCE IT 
SAYS THAT STATEMENTS MADE TO A 
PROFESSIONAL ARE CONSIDERED 
CREDIBLE. 
YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE'S GOALS. 
WHAT WOULD BE THEIR REASONS TO 
LIKE? 
I LOOK AT A JUDGE WHO HAS A 
CAREER MAKING MOMENT TO GET ON 
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
. AND NOBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE 
ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 
COURT. 
AND THEN YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO 
CAME FORWARD, SENT A LETTER AND 
TRIED TO DO WHAT SHE COULD DO 
KEEP HER NAME OUT OF THE NEWS 
AND FINALLY WHEN THE REPORTERS 
SHOWED UP, SHE CAME FORWARD. 
I JUST SEE THESE AS DIFFERENT. 
THE FACT THAT SHE MENTIONED 
THIS YEARS BEFORE MEANS A LOT. 
BUT YOU COULD HAVE DOUBTERS. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT. 
BUT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AN 
INVESTIGATION ARE THINGS IN 
WRITING TO LOOK AT THE FACTS, 
WHERE ARE WE? 
I HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE. 
I HAVE BEEN BRIEFED ON 
BACKGROUND CHECKS. 
A NUMBER OF TIMES, NOMINEES 
WOULD DROP BECAUSE OF WHAT IS 
IN THOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS. 
THE PRESS NEVER KNOWS IT BUT IT 
HAPPENS. OR SOMETIMES WE ARE 
PRESENTED WITH INFORMATION THAT 
IS NOT PUBLIC. 
DOES THIS AMOUNT TO SOMETHING? 
DOES LOOK -- LOOKING AT THIS 
WEBSITE AMOUNT TO THIS? 
THESE ARE THINGS WE HAVE 
ACTUALLY CONSIDERED. 
THAT'S THE KIND OF AFFIRMATION 
WE GET FROM THOSE BACKGROUND 
CHECKS. 
I THINK IT IS A GOOD THING. NOT 
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE DRAGGED 
THROUGH THE MUD. 
LATE MAY WE HAVE ORDER? 
-- 
>> MAY WE HAVE ORDER? 
>> I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN AN 
EVIDENCE FREEZONE. 
WE NEED THIS INFORMATION. 
I WOULD SUBMIT TO MY FRIENDS 
ACROSS THE AISLE, THIS IS NOT A 
HE SAID, SHE SAID. 
THIS IS A HE SAID, THEY SAID. 
THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO 
OPEN TALKING ABOUT THE FACT 
INCLUDING A NOMINEE'S ROOMMATE 
THAT HE IS BELLIGERENT WHEN HE 
GETS DRUNK. 
YES, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. 
MAYBE HE DOESN'T DO THAT 
ANYMORE. 
I KNOW PEOPLE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
DRINK A LOT AND IN COLLEGE BUT 
WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THIS, TO TRY 
TO GET TO THE FACTS, I'M NOT AN 
FBI AGENT BUT I WAS TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT MAYBE HE HAS PARTIAL 
MEMORY LOSS WHEN HE GETS THAT 
DRUNK OR MAYBE HE BLACKS OUT. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
I WAS TRYING TO GET THAT. 
WHAT DID I GET? 
A QUESTION IF I BLACKOUT. 
DID HE APOLOGIZE? HE DID. 
AND I APPRECIATE THAT. 
BUT THE POINT IS, IF WE COULD 
HAVE THE FBI LIKE WE DO WITH 
ALL BACKGROUND CHECKS 
INTERVIEWED THESE WITNESSES, WE 
COULD GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE 
FAX. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SAID ON FOX 
NEWS AND YESTERDAY  THAT HE 
WANTS A FAIR PROCESS. 
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID HE WANTS. 
AND WHEN I ASKED THE JUDGE WHY 
HE WOULDN'T AS THE PRESIDENT TO 
HAVE THE FBI REOPENED THE 
INVESTIGATION YESTERDAY, HE 
DIDN'T MAKE THAT REQUEST. 
HE DIDN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. 
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE IN 
AMERICA RIGHT NOW THAT CAN 
REOPEN THAT INVESTIGATION. 
THE ONE SITTING ACROSS THE ROOM 
BECAUSE YES, SENATOR GRASSLEY 
COULD HAVE HELD OFF THIS VOTE 
UNTIL WE HAD THAT 
INVESTIGATION. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH COULD HAVE 
EASILY SAID FOR THIS TO MOVE 
FORWARD,  I WANT TO AT LEAST 
CLEAR MY NAME BUT MOSTLY I WANT 
TO HAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS TRUE OR 
NOT. 
HE COULD'VE DONE THAT. 
WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT? 
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF WHAT 
THEY WILL FIND OUT. 
YESTERDAY THE AMERICAN BAR 
ASSOCIATION AND SENATOR DURBIN 
HAS JUST NOTED AND SENT A 
LETTER URGING THE COMMITTEE NOT 
TO VOTE ON THE NOMINATION AND 
TELL THE FBI HAS CONDUCTED 
APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-UP. 
IT MADE THAT REQUEST BECAUSE OF 
ITS QUOTE, RESPECT FOR THE RULE 
OF LAW AND DUE PROCESS UNDER LAW
. I'M JUST WAITING UNTIL THE 
STAFF IS DONE TALKING OVER 
THERE. 
>> I APOLOGIZED -- 
>> IT MADE THE REQUEST BECAUSE 
OF ITS RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF 
LAW AND DUE PROCESS UNDER THE 
LAW. 
I CHOSE TO GET ON THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
I DIDN'T GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY. 
I HAD DONE THIS WORK FOR 8 
YEARS BEFORE I GOT ON HERE. 
I GOT ON HERE 2 YEARS AFTER I 
GOT TO THE SENATE. 
I DECIDED I WANTED TO CONTINUE 
THAT WORK. 
TO UPHOLD THE RESPECT FOR THE 
RULE OF LAW AND DUE PROCESS 
UNDER THE LAW. 
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAW 
YESTERDAY. 
SO IF THIS COMMITTEE ISN'T 
GOING TO RESPECT THE LAW AND IF 
WE GO TO THE FLOOR AND THE SAME 
THING HAPPENS AGAIN, I WOULD 
REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE 
CONSTITUTION DOES NOT SAY WE 
THE RULING PARTY. 
THE CONSTITUTION SAYS WE THE 
PEOPLE. AND IF THE PEOPLE OF 
THIS COUNTRY WANT TO HAVE A 
CHECK AND BALANCE IN THE 
SUPREME COURT, A CHECK AND 
BALANCE ON THIS ADMINISTRATION, 
IF THEY WANT A FAIR PROCESS, 
THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT TO 
PITCH IN HERE. 
THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT TO 
HAVE A SAY. 
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THE WAY THIS 
PROCESS IS RUN, WE ARE NOT 
RUNNING LIKE WE THE PEOPLE. 
IT IS BEING RUN LIKE WE THE 
RULING PARTY. 
I VOTE NO. 
>> SENATOR. 
>> WE HEAR ABOUT FAIR AND OPEN 
AND THOROUGH AND EVERYTHING 
THAT I JUST HEARD, WE HEARD 
INFERENCE OF A POLITICAL 
STRATEGY ON THE SIDE OF THE 
AISLE NOT TO BE FAIR AND 
THOROUGH. I HAVE SEARED IN THE 
BACK OF MY MIND SOMETHING THAT 
WAS SAID SOON AFTER JULY 9, THAT
THE SENATOR SAID THAT TELLS ME 
ABOUT A POLITICAL STRATEGY THAT 
IS CARRIED ON HERE, THE WAY IT 
HAS TO DELAY AND DELAY AND 
DELAY AND DELAY BECAUSE HE SAID 
I'M GOING TO FIGHT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH 'S NOMINATION WITH 
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. 
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT HAS HAPPENED 
OVER THE LAST 90 DAYS. 
SENATOR. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
WE ARE LIVING IN A DIVIDED TIME.
THIS COUNTRY IS DIVIDED RIGHT 
DOWN THE MIDDLE. 
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF 
ANGER, THERE IS RANGE -- RAGE, 
HATRED. WE SEE DEMONSTRATORS 
SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER. THEY 
REFLECT THAT RAGE, THE ANGER. 
I KNOW THERE ARE GREAT NUMBER 
OF AMERICANS WHO WISH WE COULD 
AND BELIEVE WE CAN GET BACK TO 
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE TREAT 
EACH OTHER WITH CIVILITY AND 
DECENCY, IT BACK TO AN 
ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE HAVE 
POLICY DISAGREEMENTS, WE AGREE 
ON THE RIGHT LEGISLATION AND WE 
EVEN HAVE VIGOROUS DEBATES 
ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT POLICY IS. 
BUT WE DO SO IN A CONTEXT THAT 
RESPECTS EACH OTHER. 
THAT DOESN'T DEMEAN THE 
HUMANITY OF EACH OTHER. 
THAT DOESN'T ATTACK THE 
CHARACTER AND DRAG PEOPLE 
THROUGH THE MUD. THE POLITICS 
OF PERSONAL DESTRUCTION THAT WE 
HAVE SEEN ON DISPLAY IN RECENT 
DAYS IS WASHINGTON, D.C. AT ITS 
VERY UGLIEST. 
AND ALL OF US SHOULD REMEMBER 
THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REAL 
HUMAN BEINGS HERE. 
THESE AREN'T PONDS IN A 
CHESSBOARD. 
-- PAWNS ON A  CHESSBOARD. 
DR. FORD HAS BEEN THROUGH   I 
HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS BEEN 
PAINFUL FOR HER AND HER FAMILY. 
THE TESTIMONY THAT SHE GAVE 
YESTERDAY WAS POWERFUL. 
IT WAS REALLY HEART WRENCHING, 
IT WAS CLEAR SHE WAS HURTING. 
HAVING HER NAME MADE PUBLIC 
AGAINST HER WISHES AND DRAGGED 
THROUGH THE MUD WAS A HURTFUL 
THING TO DO. 
IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO. 
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH , HE TOO 
HAS BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH THE 
MUD FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN A 
WAY THAT HAS NO PRECEDENT 
HURRICANE -- PRECEDENT. 
IT IS ALMOST TRIBAL LYSED -- 
TRIBALIZED. 
EVERYTHING WE SEE THROUGH THE 
LENS OF THE JERSEY. 
IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY A SIGNIFICANT
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE AISLE 
SIDE YESTERDAY WAS TESTIMONY 
AND CONCLUDED -- YESTERDAY'S 
TESTIMONY AND CONCLUDED HE MUST 
BE GUILTY. 
ANYONE SURPRISE ME IF THOSE ON 
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE CONCLUDED 
HE MUST BE INNOCENT. 
ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT 
-- JUDGE KAVANAUGH  TALKED 
ABOUT HOW THE SMEARS AND THE 
MANY THAT HAVE BEEN LEVELED 
AGAINST HIM IN THE LAST TWO 
WEEKS AS HE PUT IT, HAVE 
DESTROYED HIS FAMILY. 
TO SOME THAT MAY SOUND LIKE 
HYPERBOLE. 
I DON'T THINK IT IS. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS  TWO YOUNG 
DAUGHTERS. 
A 10-YEAR-OLD AND A 13-YEAR-OLD.
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES, 
THEIR DAUGHTERS OR GO TO SCHOOL 
AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE, MANY 
OF WHOM ARE CONVINCED THEIR 
FATHER IS A RAPIST. 
I WANT YOU TO THINK OF THE 
EFFECT THAT HAS WHEN THOSE ARE 
THE ALLEGATIONS. 
THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS. 
NOT I THINK YOU ARE WRONG ON 
HOW YOU INTERPRET THE 
CONSTITUTION -- AND LET'S BE 
CLEAR, HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF 
AMONG OTHER THINGS 
PARTICIPATING IN REPEATEDLY 
DRUGGING AND GANG RAPING WOMEN 
TO TAKE SOME OF THE LUDICROUS 
CLAIMS THAT OF BEEN ERRED. 
THESE LITTLE GIRLS ARE GOING TO 
HAVE CLASSMATES REPEAT THOSE 
CHARGES TO THEM. 
SOME OF THE MOST POIGNANT 
TESTIMONY YESTERDAY WAS WHEN 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DESCRIBED  HOW 
HE HAS TAUGHT LAW FOR OVER A 
DECADE AND HE SAID HE MAY NEVER 
GET TO TEACH LAW AGAIN. 
AND THAT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. 
THAT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE EVEN 
IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH  IS 
CONFIRMED AS A SITTING JUSTICE. 
I'M A GRADUATE OF THE HARVARD 
SCHOOL. 
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THOSE ON 
THE LEFT WOULD SAY WE DON'T 
WANT SOMEONE WE BELIEVE IS A 
RAPIST EVER TEACHING AGAIN. 
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH 
HE IS LOVED -- HAS LOVED 
COACHING GIRLS BASKETBALL. 
HE MENTIONED HE MAY NEVER COACH 
AGAIN. 
THAT'S A VERY REAL POSSIBLE 
CONSEQUENCE OF THE MUDSLINGING 
AND IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR OF 
THE LAST TWO WEEKS. 
IT MAY WELL BE IN THIS DIVIDED 
WORLD THAT THE PARENTS OF THE 
OTHER GIRLS SAY WE DON'T WANT 
HIM AS A COACH ANYMORE. 
WORLDS AND -- WORDS AND ACTIONS 
HAVE CONSEQUENCES. 
THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS A 
PARTISAN TIME. 
I HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
I HAVE FAITH IN THE PEOPLE THAT 
WE WANT TO BE FAIR-MINDED. 
WE WANT TO ASSESS WHAT HAPPENS. 
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT ONCE 
THESE BECAME PUBLIC THAT DR. 
FORD WAS GIVEN A FULL  AND FAIR 
OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HER STORY. 
I URGED MY COLLEAGUES THAT WAS 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO GIVE 
HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY 
IN PUBLIC. 
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT SHE BE 
GIVEN A FAIR AND RESPECTFUL 
ENVIRONMENT. 
THAT SHE NOT BE DEMEANED OR 
ATTACKED. 
AND SHE WAS NOT HURRICANE THAT 
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS TO 
GIVE HER A PUBLIC FORUM AND A 
FULL PUBLIC FORUM TO TELL HER 
STORY. 
BUT THE RIGHT THING ALSO 
REQUIRES -- AND WE SAW 
YESTERDAY, JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
GIVEN A FULL AND FAIR 
OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND HIMSELF. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WATCHED 
THAT TESTIMONY. AND YOU COME 
AWAY WITH A NUMBER OF 
CONCLUSIONS. 
IT IS CLEAR THE TESTIMONY IS IN 
DIRECT CONFLICT. 
WHAT THEY SAID IS CORRECT 
>> CONFLICTING. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH  CATEGORICALLY 
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS. 
THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU 
RESOLVE THAT DISCREPANCY? 
HOW DOES THE COMMITTEE? 
HOW DOES A SENATE? 
HOW DID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO WITNESSES WHO 
TESTIFIED TO THINGS THAT ARE 
OPPOSED? THE ONLY WAY I KNOW TO 
DO IT  AND THIS IS HOW A 
COURT OF LAW OPERATES AND MOST 
REASONABLE OPERATE, YOU LOOK TO 
WATERS -- WHAT DOES THE REST OF 
THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATE? 
WHAT DOES IT DEMONSTRATE? 
DR. FORD  NAMED THREE WITNESSES.
SHE SAYS THEY WERE THERE AND 
COULD CORROBARATE  THE STORY. 
NONE OF THE THREE SENATOR LEAHY 
THE STORY.  
ALL THREE OF THE WITNESSES 
EXPLICITLY REFUTED HER STORY. 
AND THEY DID SO UNDER PENALTY 
OF PERJURY. THEY DIDN'T DO SO 
LIGHTLY. 
THEY DIDN'T JUST SAY IT. 
THEY DID IT IN A CONTEXT UNDER 
THE CODE THEY CAN FACE UP TO 5 
YEARS IN PRISON IF THEY LIE TO 
THE COMMITTEE. 
SO EVERY SINGLE FACT WITNESS 
THAT DR. FORD  NAMED HAS 
DISPUTED HER ALLEGATIONS. 
NOW, ONE OF THOSE PERFECT 
WITNESSES WAS MR. JUDGE. 
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MR. JUDGE. 
A LOT OF THE COLLEAGUES SAYING 
WHY DIDN'T WE HEAR TESTIMONY 
FROM MR. JUDGE? 
WELL, MR. JUDGE REFUSED TO TALK 
TO THE COMMITTEE. 
HE SUBMITTED A STATEMENT, A 
STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF 
PERJURY, UNDER PENALTY OF 
FENNEL THE -- FELONY, BUT IT IS 
NOT COMPETENT TO UNDERSTAND 
WHY. 
PUBLIC RECORD INDICATES MR. 
JUDGE HAS HAD A TROUBLED LIFE. 
HE HAS BATTLED WITH ADDICTION 
FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE. 
WE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT HE HAS 
BEEN NEAR BATH. 
-- DEATH. HE IS A CANCER 
SURVIVOR. 
HE HAS ALSO BEEN DIRECTLY 
ACCUSED OF MULTIPLE FELONIES. 
SO WHEN INVESTIGATORS ASKED TO 
INTERVIEW HIM, HE SAID NO. 
THAT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE ANYBODY.
WE HAD A VOTE EARLIER TODAY ON 
SUBPOENAING HIM. 
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN IF YOU WERE SUBPOENAED. 
IF HE CAME BEFORE THIS 
COMMITTEE, ANY DEFENSE LAWYER 
WOULD TELL MR. JUDGE NOT TO 
TESTIFY. 
I UNDERSTAND POLITICALLY 
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS WOULD VERY 
MUCH LIKE TO SEE A MAN WHO 
STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION MOST 
OF HIS LIFE SITTING BEFORE THIS 
COMMITTEE AND PLEADING THE 
FIFTH. 
THAT WOULD MAKE GREAT 
THEATRICS. 
THAT WOULD MAKE GREAT POLITICAL 
THEATRICS. 
IT WOULDN'T HELP ONE IOTA IN 
THE SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH. 
BUT IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT 
PUBLIC SHOW. 
AND I WILL SAY OF THE THREE 
FACT WITNESSES, THE ONE WHO I 
THINK IS MOST REVEALING IS 
LEGAL IN KAISER. -- LELAND 
KAISER. 
MS. KAISER HAD EVERY INCENTIVE 
TO BACK UP HER STORY. 
INSTEAD, MS. KAISER UNDER 
PENALTY OF PERJURY SAYS SHE 
DOESN'T KNOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
AND SHE HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF 
ANY PARTY LIKE THE ONE DR. FORD 
DESCRIBES.  DR. FORD TESTIFIED  
THAT MS. KAISER TEXTED HER 
AFTER SUBMITTING THAT STATEMENT 
TO SAY SHE WAS SORRY, SORRY FOR 
NOT BACKING UP HER STORY. 
I THINK THAT INDICATES 
POWERFULLY THAT HER INCENTIVES 
IF AT ALL POSSIBLE WORK TO BACK 
UP THE STORY AND YET SHE DIDN'T 
FEEL SHE COULD. 
SHE HAD NO MOTIVE TO LIE. 
EVERY INCENTIVE TO AGREE WITH 
DR. FORD'S  STORY AND YET SHE 
DID NOT DO SO. 
SO ALL THREE FACT WITNESSES 
HAVE EXPLICITLY DISPUTED THE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE? 
WE HAVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  
CALENDARS. 
I HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN THEY WERE 
FIRST RELEASED THERE WERE 
STORIES ABOUT THEM. 
I DIDN'T FIND THAT PERSUASIVE 
EVIDENCE. 
UNTIL JUDGE KAVANAUGH  WALKED 
THROUGH DAY BY DAY EACH OF THE 
POSSIBLE DAYS WHEN THIS WAS 
ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENE AND 
WALKED THROUGH THE SPECIFIC 
CONFLICT HOW HE WAS OUT OF TOWN 
FOR MANY OF THE DAYS. 
HAD CONFLICTS FOR MANY OF THE 
DAYS. 
THE NOTIONS THAT THEY WERE 
ALMOST LIKE DIARIES IS KIND OF 
ODD. 
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING MANY 
PEOPLE DO BUT IT IS SOMETHING 
HE AND HIS FATHER BOTH DO. 
THAT EVIDENCE THAT HE KEPT IN 
1982 -- THAT KIND OF EVIDENCE 
WOULD BE POWERFUL IN COURT. 
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ASCERTAIN 
TWO CONFLICTING WITNESSES, YOU 
LOOK FOR CONTEMPORANEOUS 
EVIDENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. 
AND FINALLY, WE KNOW JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S  IMPECCABLE RECORD 
OF DECADES OF PUBLIC SERVICE. 
HE IS 53 YEARS OLD. 
AND PRIOR TO TWO WEEKS AGO, 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ALLEGATIONS 
WHATSOEVER OF THIS KIND. 
SIX FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS, 
NOBODY RAISED ANY CLAIM LIKE 
THIS. 
NOW ALL OF US KNOW FROM HUMAN 
EXPERIENCE THAT IF SOMEONE IS A 
SEXUAL PREDATOR, IF SOMEONE IS 
COMMITTING THESE KINDS OF 
ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLEGED, 
THAT IT IS VERY RARE THAT THEY 
ARE A ONE TIME OFFENDER. 
IF SOMEONE IS CARRYING OUT THIS 
KIND OF CONDUCT, THEY TYPICALLY 
HAVE A PATTERN OF DOING SO OVER 
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 
WE HAVE SEEN POWERFUL MEN IN 
POLITICS AND HOLLYWOOD WHOSE 
CAREERS HAVE BEEN RIGHTLY ENDED 
BUT FOR A PATTERN OF HARASSMENT 
AND ABUSE THAT TYPICALLY 
EXTENDS DECADES. 
WHEN SOMEONE BEHAVES LIKE THIS, 
THEY BEHAVE LIKE THIS OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN. 
THERE IS NO CREDIBLE INDICATION 
THAT THAT HAS OCCURRED. 
INDEED, IT IS STRIKING THAT IN 
HIS 12 YEARS AS A FEDERAL JUDGE 
MAJORITY OF HIS LAW CLERKS HAVE 
BEEN WOMEN. 
THAT IS EXCEPTIONALLY UNUSUAL. 
I DO NOT KNOW OF ANOTHER 
FEDERAL APPELLATE JUDGE FOR 
WHOM THAT IS THE CASE. 
I CAN TELL YOU HIS LAW CLERKS 
REVERE HIM. 
THEY HOLD HIM IN THE VERY 
HIGHEST OF RESPECT. 
HIS REPUTATION IN THIS TOWN IS 
OF BEING A BOY SCOUT. 
IT IS OF BEING A BORING BOY 
SCOUT. THAT HAS BEEN HIS 
REPUTATION FOR LONG TIME. 
NOW, SOME MIGHT SAY, THERE HAVE 
BEEN THESE OTHER SENSATIONAL 
ALLEGATIONS. 
WE HAVE SEEN OTHERS THAT HAVE 
POPPED UP AFTER THIS ONE. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS STRIKING 
YESTERDAY THAT NOT A SINGLE 
DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CHOSE TO ASK 
ABOUT ANY OF THE OTHER 
ALLEGATIONS. 
I THINK THAT INDICATES HOW 
LITTLE CREDIBILITY THERE IS 
BEHIND THOSE ALLEGATIONS. 
THE ONE THAT IS THE MOST 
SENSATIONAL BY THE CLIENT OF 
MICHAEL AVENATTI MAKES 
EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS WHICH 
APPARENTLY THE COLLEAGUES ARE 
EMBARRASSED TO SAY PUBLICLY 
BECAUSE THEY DEMONSTRATE THIS 
IS A PARTISAN CIRCUS. 
IT IS NOT ABOUT SUBSTANCE. 
THIS IS ABOUT SMEARS. 
>> COULD I ASKED THE SENATOR TO 
SUM IT UP? 
THE REASON I HAVE DONE THAT IS 
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE 
EVERYBODY A CHANCE TO SPEAK. 
>> THIS COMMITTEE HAS GIVEN DR. 
FORD AND  JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
AFFAIR OPPORTUNITY TO LAY OUT 
THEIR VIEWS. 
AND I WILL SAY, UNFORTUNATELY, 
THE CONDUCT OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES, IT HAS BEEN CLEAR 
THAT THIS HAS ALL BEEN ABOUT 
POLITICS AND DELAYING THIS 
CONFIRMATION UNTIL AFTER THE 
ELECTION, HOPING THEY WIN THE 
SENATE IN THE ELECTION AND THEN 
KEEPING THE SEAT VACANT UNTIL 
2021. 
EVERY DEMOCRATIC MEMBER BEFORE 
THE CONFIRMATION HEARING STARTED
SAID THEY OPPOSED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH  BEFORE A SINGLE 
THING STARTED. 
AND NOT ONLY THAT, THIS 
ALLEGATION -- THEY HAD IT IN 
WRITING ON JULY 30. 
IF THAT HAD BEEN REPORTED TO 
THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. 
WE HAVE A PROCESS TO 
INVESTIGATE THAT IS 
CONFIDENTIAL.
>> THAT'S THE WAY THIS PROCESS 
SHOULD'VE WORKED AND THAT 
TESTIMONY YESTERDAY FROM DR. 
FORD  IS THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO 
HAD COPIES OF THE LETTER WERE 
HERSELF, THE LAWYERS, 
REPRESENTATIVE ESHOO , AND THE 
RANKING MEMBER. 
NEITHER SHE NOR HER LAWYERS 
HANDED THE LETTER OVER. 
THAT LEADS THE ONLY CONCLUSION 
POSSIBLE IS IT WAS THE -- LEAKED
TO THE MEMBER S OF CONGRESS OR 
TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO THEY GAVE 
IT. 
IF THERE ARE ONLY FOUR PEOPLE IN
TWO DID NOT GIVE IT THAN THE 
OTHER TWO ARE THE ONLY POSSIBLE 
SOURCES. 
AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY 
DEMONSTRATES A CYNICISM, A 
WILLINGNESS TO SMEAR DR. FORD  
IF IT HELPS POLITICALLY DELAY 
THIS NOMINATION. 
I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION 
TO BE FAIR, IMPARTIAL, TO 
LISTEN TO THE EVIDENCE. 
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 
AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE THIS 
COMMITTEE DOES. 
THAT'S WHAT I HOPE THE FULL 
SENATE DOES. 
>> SENATOR. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
YESTERDAY WAS AN IMPORTANT AND 
DIFFICULT DAY. 
A LONG DAY. 
FOR DR. FORD,  FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, FOR THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, FOR THE 
NATION. 
AND I WILL SAY  BRIEFLY THAT 
BEFORE YESTERDAY BEGAN I 
PRAYED. 
I PRAYED FOR DR. FORD AND HER 
FAMILY. 
I PRAYED FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
I PRAYED FOR THE CHAIRMAN  AND 
RANKING MEMBER. 
I PRAYED FOR THE PRESIDENT. 
I PRAYED FOR ALL WHO WOULD 
WATCH YESTERDAY WHO ARE VICTIMS 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND I PRAYED 
FOR ALL WHO WOULD WATCH 
YESTERDAY UNCERTAIN IF WE COULD 
CONDUCT OURSELVES RESPECTFULLY. 
AND I MUST SAY AFTER EVERYTHING 
I HAVE HEARD, I'M STRUCK THAT 
IN THE TWITTER FIELD POLITICS 
OF OUR DAY, WE MUST ASK 
OURSELVES WHAT ABOUT OUR 
CONDUCT? 
WHAT ABOUT THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE 
ANYONE TO COME FORWARD WITH 
CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, TO SEEK A NOMINATION 
TO FEDERAL COURT OR OTHER 
POSITION OF -- POSITION OF TRUST
, OR TO SERVE HERE? 
I WILL PRAY FOR OUR NATION 
TONIGHT. 
THE BURDEN ON THIS COMMITTEE 
WAS TO ADDRESS, INVESTIGATE, 
AND RESOLVE REASONABLE DOUBTS 
AS TO CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST THE NOMINEE BEFORE THEM.
BY THAT TEST, THIS COMMITTEE 
HAS FAILED. 
I KNOW WE HAVE HEARD STRONG 
WORDS ABOUT MANY COLLEAGUES. 
AND MY PREDECESSOR, LONG 
SERVING SENATOR JOE BIDEN HAS 
BEEN COURTED BY MANY AND I 
WOULD SAY MISQUOTED AT TIMES. 
I WANT TO SHARE ONE QUOTE HE 
SAID TO ME. 
IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO 
QUESTION ANOTHER SENATOR'S 
POLICIES. 
IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO 
QUESTION PRIORITIES BUT IS 
NEVER APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION 
MOTIVES. 
AND THERE HAS BEEN FAR TOO MUCH 
OF THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
THIS PROCESS. 
IN A WAY THAT, FRANKLY, WILL 
MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO 
TAKE OFF OUR PARTISAN JERSEYS 
AND GET BACK TO THE IMPORTANT 
WORK OF FINDING SOLUTIONS TO 
THE REAL CHALLENGES FACING THIS 
COUNTRY. 
WHAT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR 
IN THIS PROCESS IS THE FAX. 
-- FACTS. 
MANY OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONED THE 
TIMING. 
I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THESE 
POINTS AND WANT TO EXPLAIN 
BRIEFLY WHY. 
THE FIRST TIME I LEARNED OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH  SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 
HER WAS ON SEPTEMBER 12. 
RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN 
DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION TO 
MYSELF AND OTHER DEMOCRATS ONLY 
AFTER REPORTERS HAD LEARNED OF 
THE LETTER DR. FORD PROVIDED.  
I REGRET THAT THIS LEAK. 
THE DECISION IF SHE CAME FOR 
SHOULD'VE BEEN DR. FORD 'S AND 
DR. FORD 'S ALONE. 
I CANNOT RULE OUT THAT THE 
PERSON WHO LEAKED THIS HAD AN 
AGENDA BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT 
RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN DID 
NOT DISCLOSE THAT PRIOR TO THAT 
DATE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIRS 
TO SHARE. 
I THINK IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT 
LONG SERVING HONORABLE 
COLLEAGUES OF HERS HAVE 
QUESTIONED HER MOTIVES. 
I KNOW SINCE THE DAY THAT MY 
COLLEAGUES AND I LEARNED OF 
THESE ALLEGATIONS WE'VE HAD ONE 
CONSISTENT REQUEST TO ALLOW THE 
FBI TO INVESTIGATE THEM IN A 
NONPARTISAN, PROFESSIONAL, 
EVENHANDED MANNER AND DELIVERED 
THEIR FINDINGS SO WE COULD 
REACH A CONCLUSION. 
THAT SAME NIGHT SHE SENT A 
LETTER REQUESTING SUCH AN 
INVESTIGATION. 
ASSESSED -- TO SUGGEST THAT 
LETTERS ARE AN ADEQUATE 
SUBSTITUTE FOR EFFECT GATHERING 
PROCESS THAT WE MIGHT THEN 
CONSIDER IS NOT CREDIBLE AND 
REFLECTS SADLY, A WILLFUL 
BLINDNESS TO THE INSTITUTION. 
TO MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE 
AISLE, YOU KNOW ME. 
YOU KNOW I TRY TO BE FAIR TO 
NOMINEES. 
I RESPECT THIS PROCESS AND THE 
MIDI OF THOSE WITH WHOM I 
PASSIONATELY DISAGREE. IF I 
WERE CONVINCED THIS WERE 
NOTHING MORE THAN A PARTISAN 
HIT JOB DESIGNED TO TAKE DOWN A 
GUNMAN AND HOLD THE POSITION 
VACANT, I WOULD NOT STAND FOR 
IT. 
AN INVESTIGATION WOULD BE 
HELPFUL BECAUSE DR. FORD 'S 
RECOLLECTION OF HER ASSAULT WAS 
SEARING BUT INCOMPLETE. 
DR. FORD  TESTIFIED CREDIBLY 
ABOUT THESE PAINFUL MEMORIES 
SHE'S CARRIED WITH HER. 
THE FEELING OF A HAND CLASPED 
OVER HER MOUTH AND NOT BEING 
ABLE TO BREATHE. 
THE SOUND OF LAUGHTER WHILE SHE 
WAS PINNED ON A BED. THE WEIGHT 
OF A BODY ON TOP OF HER AND OF 
FEELING OF RELIEF FLEEING THE 
HOUSE. 
SHE TESTIFIED WITH CERTAINTY 
THAT THE PERSON WHO ASSAULTED 
HER WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH WHO SHE 
KNEW THROUGH MULTIPLE  
ACQUAINTANCES AND HAD 
SOCIALIZED WITH HIM MULTIPLE 
OCCASIONS. 
BUT IT IS TRUE AS WIDELY 
REPEATED THAT DR. FORD CANNOT 
PINPOINT  THE DATE OR THE TIME 
OF THE ASSAULT, THE EXACT 
LOCATION, AND THAT SHE DID NOT 
TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THAT ASSAULT 
AT THAT TIME. 
THERE IS NOT AN EYEWITNESS WHO 
IS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THE 
DETAILS OF THIS. 
ALL OF WHICH IS TYPICAL OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT. MANY EXPERTS 
HAVE SAID HOW COMMON IT IS FOR 
SURVIVORS TO REMEMBER SOME 
FACTS WITH CLARITY AND NOT 
OTHERS. 
IT HAS TO DO A SURVIVAL MODE 
THAT TURNS ON WHEN WE 
EXPERIENCE TRAUMA. 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF VICTIMS 
DELAY DISCLOSING WHAT HAPPENED 
OR NEVER DISCLOSE IT AT ALL. 
ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING THINGS 
ABOUT THIS HEARING FOR ME HAS 
BEEN THE SO FAR FIVE, FIVE 
PERSONAL FRIENDS, ACQUAINTANCES
, PEOPLE I'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS 
OR DECADES WHO HAVE CONVEYED TO 
ME THEIR EXPERIENCES OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT ON THIS PHONE WHILE 
THIS TESTIMONY WAS GOING ON. 
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS AN 
OCEAN OF PAIN IN THIS NATION 
NOT FULLY HEARD, NOT FULLY 
ADDRESSED, NOT APPROPRIATELY 
RESOLVED. 
AND I FOR ONE WILL NOT -- THE 
REFRAIN SAID BY TOO MANY IN 
RESPONSE TO THESE ALLEGATIONS BY
DR. FORD THAT IT HAPPENED TOO 
LONG AGO THAT  BOYS WILL BE 
BOYS. 
WE MUST DO BETTER THAN THAT. 
WE MUST SET A BETTER STANDARD 
FOR OUR OWN FAMILIES AND OUR 
FUTURE. 
I WORRY SINCERELY ABOUT THE 
MESSAGE WE ARE SENDING TO 
ASSAULT SURVIVORS IF WE PLOW 
AHEAD WITH THIS NOMINATION 
DESPITE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
AND I HAVE CONVEYED TO MY 
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES THAT 
I'VE WISHED WE WOULD TAKE A ONE-
WEEK BREAK. 
ONE WEEK ONLY. 
NOT TO SPELL THIS OUT PAST THE 
ELECTION, NOT TO PURSUE SOME 
PART A SINGLE, BUT TO ALLOW AN 
INTERVIEW WITH EVERYONE WHO MAY 
HAVE RELEVANT INFORMATION. 
STARTING, YES, WITH MARK JUDGE 
WHO OBVIOUSLY WILL NOT BE 
SUBPOENAED TO APPEAR BEFORE US. 
I WILL REMIND YOU BRIEFLY THAT 
MANY OF THOSE WHO CAME FORWARD 
TO SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
INCLUDING MY OWN PROFESSOR FROM 
YALE LAW SCHOOL AND AN 
ORGANIZATION I'VE LONG LONG TO 
HAVE SPOKEN UP TO ALSO REQUEST 
A THOROUGH AND PROFESSIONAL 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. 
I THINK TO ASK FOR A WEEK IS 
NOT TO ASK FOR TOO MUCH. 
WHEN ANITA HILL CAME FORWARD, 
THE WHITE HOUSE COOPERATED AND 
IN FOUR DAYS, IN FOUR DAYS A 
HEARING WAS PUT TOGETHER WITH 
22 WITNESSES. 
I THINK THAT IS WHAT DR. FORD 
DESERVES.  
I THINK THAT IS WHAT HER 
BRAVERY DESERVES. 
I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE NATION 
DESERVES. 
I WOULD NOT GO THROUGH A LONG 
POINT BY POINT -- OF WHAT WE 
HAVE JUST HEARD BUT LET ME 
SIMPLY SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT 
DR. FORD'S  TESTIMONY. 
SHE HAD THE PAIN OF THIS ATTACK 
FOR TOO LONG. 
HER MEMORIES DO NOT SAVORS 
LOAN. 
DR. FORD  TOLD HER HUSBAND IN 
2002. 
SHE TOLD THERAPISTS IN 2012 AND 
2013. 
SHE TOLD FRIENDS IN SEVERAL 
YEARS. 
AND HAS SUBMITTED TESTIMONY 
ABOUT ALL OF THAT TO THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
DR. FORD  WHEN SHE CAME FORWARD 
ESTERDAY, HAD N 
AND A LOT TO LOSE. 
SHE CAME FORWARD TO TESTIFY 
ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE OF 
ASSAULT. 
I'M GOING TO USE HER WORDS. 
SHE SAID I'M HERE TODAY NOT 
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE, I'M 
TERRIFIED. 
I'M HERE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT 
IS MY CIVIC DUTY TO TELL YOU 
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHILE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH  AND I WERE IN HIGH 
SCHOOL. 
CIVIC DUTY. 
THE CIVIC DUTY TO TELL THE 
TRUTH. 
DR. FORD CAME FORWARD TO VOICE 
CONCERNS ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
BEFORE HE WAS NOMINATED. 
SHE REACHED OUT TO HER 
CONGRESSWOMAN ANONYMOUSLY AND 
TO THE WASHINGTON POST AS WELL 
WHEN HIS NAME WAS ON THE 
SHORTLIST. 
SHE WAS NOT LYING IN WAIT FOR A 
TIME TO MAKE A BIG REVEAL TO 
SINK A NOMINEE. 
SHE WANTED THIS INFORMATION TO 
GET TO PRESIDENT -- THE 
PRESIDENT BEFORE HE MADE HIS 
SELECTION. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH  UNEQUIVOCALLY 
DENIED THAT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 
HIM YESTERDAY. 
BUT SOMETHING HE SAID 
REPEATEDLY WAS NOT ACCURATE. 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE 
TESTIFIED AND WE JUST HEARD 
REPEATED TODAY THAT DR. FORD'S  
ACCOUNT WAS REFUTED BY THREE 
INDIVIDUALS. 
THAT'S NOT THE CASE. 
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH KNOWS IT.  
NOT RECALL IT IS NOT THE SAME 
AS REFUTING. 
THEIR STATEMENTS SAY THEY DON'T 
REMEMBER THE GATHERING. OF 
COURSE, NONE OF THESE THREE 
PEOPLE WERE SALTED THAT NIGHT. 
FOR TWO OF THEM IT WOULD'VE 
BEEN AN UNREMARKABLE EVENING. 
JUST ANOTHER CASUAL SUMMER. 
LELAND KAISER SAID THAT SHE 
BELIEVES DR. FORD'S  ACCOUNT. 
THAT'S A FACT THAT HASN'T BEEN 
ACKNOWLEDGED. 
IN MY FIELD -- VIEW, -- IT IS A 
FAILURE IN THE EFFORT TO GET TO 
THE TRUTH. 
WE ALSO HAVE TO FACE THE 
REALITY, THERE ARE ADDITIONAL 
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS BROUGHT IN 
BY MS. RAMIREZ AND MISS 
SWETNICK WHO OF BOTH  ASPIRIN 
FBI INVESTIGATION. 
THEIR CLAIMS HAVE VARYING 
CREDIBILITY BUT DESERVE TO BE 
HEARD. 
I WISH JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD 
HAVE SUPPORTED A SHORT  PAUSE 
FOR AN INVESTIGATION FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF CLEARING HIS OWN 
NAME. 
WHAT I WILL SAY AS I CONCLUDE 
-- BUT I WILL SAY AS I 
CONCLUDE, THERE IS SUCH THING 
-- SUCH -- SOMETHING GREATER AT 
STAKE. 
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT HIS 
CREDIBILITY. 
IT'S ABOUT THE COURT'S 
LEGITIMACY. 
WE ARE LEFT WITH THE REALITY IF 
HIS NOMINATION GOES FORWARD 
THIS MORNING, AFTER TESTIMONY 
FULL OF RAGE AND VITRIOL BUT 
WITHOUT A BRIEF PAUSE FOR 
NONPARTISAN INVESTIGATIONS, HIS 
SERVICE MAY HAVE AN ASTERIX. 
THEY WILL HAVE REASON TO 
QUESTION THE FAIRNESS OF THE 
INSTITUTION. 
THAT IS TOO GREAT A COST TO 
IMPOSE IN EXCHANGE FOR ANY ONE 
MAN. 
IT IS MY HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES
, THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET 
DECIDED OR DECLARED THEIR 
DECISION WILL STILL JOIN IN A 
REQUEST TO ALLOW THE FBI TO DO 
IT'S IMPORTANT WORK AND FOR 
THIS COMMITTEE TO ALLOW ITSELF 
THE TIME TO GET TO THE BOTTOM 
OF THE REMAINING ALLEGATIONS. 
EVEN THE VOTE, I KNOW THAT IS 
HIGHLY UNLIKELY. 
-- GIVEN THE VOTE, I KNOW THAT 
IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. 
THOSE HEARINGS BEGAN WITHOUT A 
DECLARED POSITION BY MANY OF MY 
COLLEAGUES ON THIS SIDE. 
FOR ME, IT WAS JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S  EXTREME VIEWS ON 
PRESIDENTIAL POWER THAT I 
ENGAGE WITH HIM VIGOROUSLY ON 
AND THAT I BELIEVE I ENGAGE 
WITH HIM RESPECTFULLY ON THAT 
DETERMINED MY VOTE ON HIM. 
BUT FOR US TO PROCEED TODAY 
WITHOUT GIVING THE THOUGHTFUL, 
SERIOUS, AND THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION IS FOR THIS 
COMMITTEE TO FAIL TO DO ITS JOB.
I PRAY THAT AFTER TODAY WE MAY 
YET FIND A WAY TO WORK TOGETHER 
BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY, THE 
COUNTRY, THE WORLD DESERVES NO 
LESS. 
THANK YOU. 
>> I'M GOING TO ASK MY 
COLLEAGUES ON THE SIDE OF THE 
AISLE IF -- AND I'M NOT GOING 
TO ASK THE DEMOCRATS TO DO THIS 
BUT COULD WE KIND OF -- I HAVE 
ONLY INTERRUPTED SENATOR CRUISE.
CAN WE MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE 
REMARKS A LITTLE SHORT SO 
EVERYBODY CAN SPEAK? 
SENATOR KENNEDY. 
OKAY. 
I GUESS I'M WRONG. 
SENATOR. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I WILL DO THAT. 
I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND FIRST 
TO A NUMBER OF THE COMMENTS 
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION AND THE 
DYNAMIC OF WHAT THIS COMMITTEE 
HAS DONE. 
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THIS 
COMMITTEE HAS CHANGED ITS 
PROCEDURE. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT HAS 
CONDUCTED THIS BUSINESS IN THIS 
WAY. 
AGAIN, AS I SAID YESTERDAY, I 
THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE 
CLARIFIED AND CORRECTED. 
THE FACT IS THAT WHEN THE FBI 
DOES ITS BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION, IT DOES JUST THAT
. A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. 
TALKS TO PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE NOMINEE. 
IT TAKES A STATEMENT FROM THEM. 
AND THEN IT DELIVERS ITS 
PACKAGE OF INVESTIGATIVE 
INFORMATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
WHICH PASSES IT ON TO THE 
COMMITTEE. 
THAT'S THE REPORT THIS COMMITTEE
RECEIVES FROM THE FBI. 
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT PRESIDENT 
BUSH REOPENED THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION WHEN THE ANITA 
HILL AFFIRMATION CAME OUT. 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS -- AND IF 
I'M WRONG, PLEASE CORRECT ME BUT
WHEN YOU AS THE CHAIRMAN 
FINALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE 
INFORMATION, THAT INFORMATION 
ALSO WENT TO THE FBI. 
PERHAPS IT WAS THE RANKING 
MEMBER THAT GAVE THE LETTER TO 
THE FBI. 
BUT THE FBI WAS GIVEN THE 
INFORMATION. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> THAT'S CORRECT. 
AND HE SAID TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
IN THE USUAL WAY THEY DO, THEY 
CONSIDER IT CLOSED. 
>> SO FIRST OF ALL, THE FULL 
LETTER UNREACTED WAS GIVEN TO 
THE FBI -- REDACTED WAS GIVEN 
TO THE FBI. 
THEY DID EXACTLY WHAT USUALLY 
DOES. 
THAT IS TO REOPEN IT, IF YOU 
WILL, EVALUATE THE LETTER, AND 
I UNDERSTAND THE FBI THEN 
CLOSED IT AND SENT THE 
INFORMATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
AS THEY DID WITH THE PREVIOUS 
REPORT BEFORE THIS ALLEGATION 
CAME UP. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> THE ONLY THING I CAN VERIFY 
IS THAT THE FBI DID WHAT THEY 
WOULD USUALLY DO AND THEY -- 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS. 
AND THEY PROBABLY WOULD KEEP 
THEIR OWN INTERNAL STUFF TO 
THEMSELVES. 
THEY SENT A COVER LETTER TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE SAYING THE ISSUE 
WAS CLOSE. 
>> SO THE FBI DID LOOK AT THIS. 
THEY DID WHATEVER IT DOES IN 
BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND THEN 
THEY RESENT AN UPDATED AMOUNT 
OF INFORMATION TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE WHICH THEY THEN FORWARDED 
TO US. 
AND THEN THE PROCESS WHICH HAS 
BEEN TRADITIONALLY FOLLOWED WAS 
FOLLOWED AGAIN. 
AND I BELIEVE THAT IMMEDIATELY 
THE CHAIRMAN OPENED UP AN 
INVESTIGATION BY THIS COMMITTEE.
THAT ALSO IS CUSTOMARY PRACTICE.
AND AS HAS BEEN STATED BUT I 
WILL RESTATE AGAIN, OUR 
COMMITTEE STAFF WHICH IS 
EXTENSIVE AND WELL TRAIN HAS 
LEGAL AUTHORITIES -- TRAINED 
HAS LEGAL AUTHORITIES SIMILAR TO
FBI INVESTIGATORS. 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERVIEWED 
AND THOSE WHO ARE REACHED OUT 
TO BY THE COMMITTEE ARE UNDER 
PENALTY OF A FELONY THAT COULD 
RESULT IN 5 YEARS IN PRISON IF 
THEY DON'T RESPOND HONESTLY AND 
CORRECTLY TO THE QUESTIONS. 
EVERY ONE OF THE WITNESSES THAT 
WAS IDENTIFIED HAS BEEN REACHED 
OUT TO. 
NOW, SOME COMMENTS HAVE BEEN 
THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY SUBMIT 
THEMSELVES TO A DEPOSITION OR 
TO SOME KIND OF A COURT PROCESS 
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
AS WE ARE AWARE OF, THE 
ALTERNATIVE IS TO TRY TO GET A 
STATEMENT FROM THEM. 
AND IN THIS CASE, UNDER PENALTY 
OF FELONY WERE FROM ALL OF THE 
WITNESSES. 
I THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE 
WAS SOME PROCESS THAT WAS NOT 
FAIR. THE ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS 
NOT THE SAME THAT IT IS 
FOLLOWED IN THE PAST IS ALSO 
INACCURATE. 
THAT'S ALSO VERY CRITICAL. 
TO TURN TO THE ISSUE AT HAND, 
WE RECEIVED HOURS AND HOURS OF 
TESTIMONY FROM TWO WITNESSES. 
AND BOTH OF THEM, FRANKLY MADE 
STRONG CASES. 
THIS COMMITTEE IS UNDER THE NEED
TO EVALUATE THE TESTIMONY THAT 
WAS GIVEN. 
AND DETERMINE HOW IT WILL -- IN 
THAT CONTEXT, I CAME AWAY 
BELIEVING THERE HAD BEEN A 
SEXUAL ASSAULT IN DR. FORD'S  
PAST. 
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WHEN, 
WHERE, AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES. 
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
THAT SHE TRUTHFULLY TESTIFIED 
THAT SHE HAD HAD A SEXUAL 
ASSAULT. 
I HAVE TO SAY, I ALSO LISTENED 
FAIRLY -- VERY CAREFULLY TO 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS HE  
TESTIFIED. 
AND I FELT THAT THE TESTIMONY 
HE GAVE WAS ALSO HONEST. 
HE GAVE VERY STRONG TESTIMONY 
THAT HE WAS NOT THERE. 
AND SO, THIS COMMITTEE HAS TO 
FACE THE DIFFICULT TASK OF WHAT 
BURDEN OF PROOF APPLIES AND 
WHAT STANDARD DOESN'T APPLY IN 
EXERCISING THE ADVICE AND 
CONSENT THAT IT GIVES, AND 
THAT'S IT DIFFICULT THINK THAT 
EACH ONE OF US INDIVIDUALLY 
NEEDS TO FACE AND DEAL WITH. 
AS I HAVE SAID, I DON'T FEEL 
THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS THERE NOT 
NIGHT . I BELIEVE HIS TESTIMONY.
I BELIEVE DR. FORD'S  TESTIMONY 
ABOUT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND 
BECAUSE OF THAT, I WILL VOTE 
YES TODAY TO MOVE THE NOMINATION
FORWARD TO THE FLOOR. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS HAS BEEN 
MY FIRST PROCESS. 
MY FIRST TIME THROUGH A SUPREME 
COURT NOMINATION PROCESS. 
I FOUGHT FOR YEARS TO BE ON 
THIS COMMITTEE. 
IT'S THE ONE I WANTED TO BE ON 
AS SOON AS I GOT TO THE SENATE 
IN 2013. 
I MADE YOU AWARE OF THAT, SIR. 
IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE 
EXPERIENCE, A LIFETIME DREAM TO 
BE A PART OF THIS COMMITTEE. 
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOU.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE EVEN 
CRITICIZED ME FOR THE AFFECTION 
WITH WHICH I HAVE FOR YOU, SIR. 
YOU HAVE BEEN A PARTNER. 
THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE 
SENIOR MEMBERS, YOU ALL -- 
SENATOR HATCH, SENATOR GRASSLEY,
SENATOR LEAHY, SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN, YOU WILL HAVE BEEN 
ANCHORS IN THIS ENTIRE 
INSTITUTION TO A TIME WHERE THE 
COMEDY WAS DEEPER AND GREATER 
AND HAVE RESISTED IN MANY WAYS 
THAT I FIND ADMIRABLE. THE 
DRIFT TOWARDS TRIBALISM WITHIN 
THIS INSTITUTION. WHEN A 
VACANCY HAPPENED, I WAS ONE OF 
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO NOT 
WAIT LONG BEFORE I NOTICED MY 
INTENTIONS TO VOTE AGAINST 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
AND, SIR, I DID IT FOR 
SINCERELY HELD BELIEFS. 
I DID IT BECAUSE I FELT THIS 
WAS A PERSON THAT HAD MADE IT 
CLEAR AND THAT ENTIRE LIST 
PREPARED, THAT THIS WAS A GUY 
THAT SPOKE DIRECTLY TOWARDS A 
VIEW OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER, 
RESIDENTIAL IMMUNITIES. 
IN THIS PEERLESS TIME WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT IS THE SUBJECT OF A 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, HE WAS 
GOING TO PROTECT THAT PRESIDENT 
AND SAID AS MUCH. 
MAKE SURE THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WAS ABOVE THE LAW AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY. 
AND, SIR, I HAVE LEARNED A LOT. 
I'M ONE OF THE GUYS ON THE SIDE 
OF THE AISLE, WHEN MY 
COLLEAGUES SPEAK, I LISTEN. 
I TRIED TO GIVE THEM MY FULL 
ATTENTION. 
AND I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE, BUT 
I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM MY 
COLLEAGUES. AND MY FRIENDSHIPS 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, 
MY SINCERE FRIENDSHIPS -- THERE 
IS BEEN TIMES I'VE TEXTED BACK 
AND FORTH WITH PEOPLE ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. 
I RESPECT THEM. 
AND I HAVE FOUGHT HARD DURING 
THIS PROCESS. 
I HAVE GIVEN IT EVERYTHING I 
GOT. 
I HAVE LEARNED THAT GOING BACK 
TO BEING A FOOTBALL PLAYER. 
BETWEEN THE WHISTLES YOU FIGHT 
AS HARD AS YOU CAN FOR WHAT YOU 
BELIEVE. 
IF YOU WANT TO CALL THAT 
PARTISANSHIP, FIND. 
-- FINE. 
I HAVE BEEN EXUBERANT IN MY 
BELIEFS. 
AND I HAVE LEARNED A LOT 
THROUGH THIS PROCESS. 
SOME OF MY COMMENTS HAVE BEEN 
REFERENCED NUMEROUS TIMES AND I 
KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN AS 
PER SIZED AND ALLOWED COMMENTS 
TO BE MISCHARACTERIZED. 
AND I DON'T BLAME THOSE PEOPLE. 
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND HAVE 
LEARNED TO BE MORE PRECISE. 
I TALKED TO THESE ISSUES AND 
VALUES AS MUCH AS I CAN. 
I TRAVEL AROUND THIS COUNTRY 
CALLING FOR RESPECT, DIGNITY OF 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND 
RECOGNIZING AS MUCH AS I CAN -- 
AND I SAY IT. 
YOU CANNOT LOVE YOUR COUNTRY 
UNLESS YOU LOVE ALL YOUR COUNTRY
MEN AND WOMEN. 
THE GOODNESS AND THE DECENCY OF 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IS 
SELF-EVIDENT. WE DEMONIZE EACH 
OTHER IN WAYS THAT I WILL BE IN 
CONTINUE TO BE TRYING TO GET 
THE DIALOGUE TO RISE TO 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, TO BE A 
COUNTRY THAT SEES WE NEED EACH 
OTHER. 
THERE IS NO DEMOCRATIC OR 
REPUBLICAN WAY. 
THERE IS ONLY AN AMERICAN WAY. 
SIR, YOU KNOW, -- AND I'VE SAID 
THIS TO YOU PERSONALLY AND 
PUBLICLY, IN THE HARDNES IN 
WHICH I FIGHT, I MADE NO 
PERSONAL INSULT. 
THE CHARGES CAME UP AND I SAY 
SINCERELY THAT I THINK THE WAY 
THIS PROCESS WAS RUN WAS A 
SHAM. 
I USED THAT WORD, SIR. 
AND IT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE 
EVALUATING SOMEONE FOR THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND WITH 
SUCH A SMALL PART OF HIS 
RELEVANT PRODUCT. 
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO MUCH OF 
HIS WRITING -- APPROXIMATELY 
90% WAS NOT BEING SEEN BY THIS 
COMMITTEE AND CONTROLLED BY A 
PROCESS THAT WAS SO BROKEN. 
AND THEN, SIR, I VIOLATED THE 
RULES THAT YOU PUT FORWARD IN 
THIS COMMITTEE. 
WILLFULLY AND KNOWINGLY AND 
ACCEPTING THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
THAT. 
AND I DID SO BECAUSE THE 
DOCUMENTS THAT WERE BEING 
WITHHELD FROM THE PUBLIC, I 
FELT THEY HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW. 
THEY WEREN'T CLASSIFIED. 
WERE NO NATIONAL SECURITY 
ISSUES. 
WE DISAGREED ON THAT, SIR. 
I LOCKED HORNS WITH PEOPLE 
ACROSS THE AISLE AND EVEN AFTER 
ALL THAT, I WAS GRATEFUL FOR 
THE COMEDY. 
THE GENTLEMAN SAID I WAS TAUGHT 
TO HATE THE SIN BUT LOVE THE 
SINNER. 
I REALLY LOVE BEING ON THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
I LOVE IT. 
FROM LIVING IN NEWARK, NEW 
JERSEY, THIS IS WHERE WANTED TO 
BE, SIR. 
I WANTED TO BE ON A COMMITTEE 
THAT DEALT WITH ISSUES OF 
JUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE 
WHEN WE SWEAR AN OATH TO 
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, I 
DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET AS 
A COUNTRY. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY NOW, AS I'M 
SITTING HERE THAT I DEEPLY 
RESENT THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW 
WHEN DR. FORD CAME FORWARD  
THAT THIS DEALT WITH 
PARTISANSHIP. THIS HAS SHIFTED 
THE DEBATE IN THIS COMMITTEE 
AND IN THIS COUNTRY FROM RAW 
PARTISANSHIP TO SOMETHING MUCH 
DEEPER. 
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR THE 
RANKING MEMBER. AND I WAS IN 
THE ROOM WHEN WE DISCUSSED, 
LITERALLY, HOURS AFTER I WAS 
MADE AWARE OF THE LETTER 
EXISTING ABOUT WHAT HER 
MOTIVATIONS WERE. 
FORGIVE ME FOR SPEAKING OUT OF 
TURN IF THE RANKING MEMBER 
BELIEVES I AM, BUT HER ENTIRE 
SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS. 
POLITICS WAS NOT MENTIONED. 
HER ENTIRE CONCERN WAS ABOUT 
THE DIGNITY AND HUMIDITY AND 
THE RESPECT FOR DR. FORD.  
THE CONVERSATION WE HAD WAS 
ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE 
THE INFORMATION THAT WAS JUST 
PRESENTED TO ALL OF US. 
I HAVE NOW BEEN IN NUMEROUS 
MEETINGS WERE POLITICS HAS NOT 
BEEN DISCUSSED. 
-- WHERE POLITICS HAS NOT BEEN 
DISCUSSED. 
THERE BEEN SOME OF THE MOST 
ELOQUENT SPEAKING S OF -- I'VE 
HEARD COLLEAGUES READ LETTERS 
THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY 
AMERICANS WHO ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THIS ISSUE. 
THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT 
FOR THE COUNTRY. 
BACK IN THE EARLY 1990S, I WAS 
A STUDENT DURING THE ANITA HILL 
CLARENCE THOMAS HEARINGS. 
AND I THINK THERE PEOPLE ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THAT 
AGREED THAT WAS DEALT WITH 
WRONGLY. 
THE PROX US -- PROCESS DID NOT 
MERIT THE DIGNITY AND DECENCY 
OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED ARE OF 
THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 
YET, THAT INVOLVED MULTIPLE 
HEARINGS. 
THAT INVOLVED MULTIPLE 
WITNESSES. 
THAT INVOLVED AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
AND YET WE STILL CRITICIZE THAT 
PROCESS. 
NOW WE ARE HERE TODAY AND WE 
HAVE FALLEN EVEN FAR SHORT OF 
WHAT I BELIEVED WAS AN 
INADEQUATE PROCESS. 
SIR, THIS IS NOT ABOUT 
PARTISANSHIP. 
AND A LOT OF FOLKS ARE TRYING 
TO MAKE THIS ABOUT THE -- IF 
SHE WAS FLYING TO CALIFORNIA OR 
NOT. 
IF THE LETTER WAS AUTHORIZED TO 
BE RELEASED OR NOT. 
IF THE PROCESS SERVED HER NOT. 
THAT SEEMS TO BE STRIPPING AWAY 
THE HEROISM OF DR. FORD  TO 
COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE 
WILLINGLY EVEN UNDER 
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE SAID 
HERSELF WERE NOT HER WISHES. 
SHE ASKED FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
SHE HAS FOR MORE WITNESSES. 
SHE WASN'T GIVEN THAT SHE STILL 
CAME HER SET BEFORE THE 
COMMITTEE. 
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY, SIR? 
WHEN SOMEONE WHO HAS THE 
COURAGE TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE 
MOST POWERFUL BODIES IN THE 
LAND, WHAT DID SHE SAY? 
SHE SHARED A RAW AND VISCERAL 
INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY WITH THIS 
COMMITTEE AND THE WORLD AND SHE 
WAS BELIEVABLE. 
I BELIEVE HER. 
SHE TOLD US OF HER INDELIBLE 
MEMORY, USING WORDS LIKE SEARED 
INTO HER MEMORY. 
SPEAKING TO BRAIN CHEMISTRY -- 
SHE SPOKE OF UPROARIOUS 
LAUGHTER  OF BRETT KAVANAUGH 
AND  MARK JUDGE. BEING PINNED 
TO A BED, BEING -- HANDOVER THE 
MOST, FEARING FOR HER LIFE. 
SHE WAS TERRIFIED OF BEING 
RAPED OR ACCIDENTALLY KILLED. 
WHEN ASKED BY THIS COMMITTEE 
WHAT LEVEL OF CERTAINTY, THIS 
WAS I DON'T KNOW. 
I'M NOT 100% SURE. 
SHE SAID I AM 100 PERCENT 
CERTAIN -- 100% CERTAIN IT WAS 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
IT WAS SEARED INTO HER MEMORY. 
SHE KNOWS 100%. 
THAT'S CREDIBLE BECAUSE SHE 
KNEW HIM. 
SHE HAD INTERACTED WITH HIM 
SOCIALLY. 
BEFORE HE ATTACKED HER. 
SHE DIDN'T NEED TO PICK A 
MODIFIED LINEUP. 
-- HIM OUT OF A LINEUP. 
SHE KNEW HIM. 
THIS IS NOT STAND ON ITS OWN. 
IT IS BOLSTERED BY SIGNIFICANT 
CORROBARATE.  
IN 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 SHE 
SPOKE OF IT. 
SHE TOLD TO FIVE PEOPLE LONG 
BEFORE JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS  
NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME COURT. 
SHE TOLD MULTIPLE PEOPLE THAT 
SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 
AS A TEENAGER. 
SHE IDENTIFIED HIM SPECIFICALLY 
NAME IN SOME INSTANCES. 
IN OTHERS SHE DESCRIBED HER 
ATTACKER AS A FEDERAL JUDGE. 
EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE 
PROVIDED THIS COMMITTEE WITH 
THEIR SWORN STATEMENTS 
ATTESTING TO THESE FACTS. 
WE COULD'VE CALLED THOSE 
INDIVIDUALS TO TESTIFY THAT 
THIS WAS NOT WHAT I HAVE HEARD. 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 
CLINTONS AND ALL THE OTHER ÃºALL 
IN THE EARLY YEARS HAD TALKED 
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH  
ASSAULTING HER. 
IT'S NOT A POLITICAL ATTACK. 
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH HER 
STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
CORROBARATE  D AND DR. FORD'S  
ATTACK IS ALSO COOPERATED WITH 
INDEPENDENT FACTS. 
THEY WERE FRIENDS OF KAVANAUGH  
AND PRESENT IS CORROBARATE  T --
CORROBRATED. 
DR. FORD  TESTIFIED SHORTLY 
AFTER THE ASSAULT, AROUND SIX 
TO EIGHT WEEKS LATER SHE RAN 
INTO MARK JUDGE AT A LOCAL 
GROCERY STORE. 
AND HE SEEMED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
TO SEE HER. 
IN HIS BOOK, MARK JUDGE 
DESCRIBED WORKING AT A LOCAL 
GROCERY STORE IN THE SUMMER OF 
1982. 
IT IS ALL CONSISTENT. THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES ALSO SUPPORT HER. 
FIRST SHE MADE CONTACT WITH 
ELECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES BEFORE 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS EVEN 
NOMINATED.  
THIS ISN'T SOME POLITICAL HIT 
JOB. BEFORE HE WAS EVEN 
NOMINATED, SHE CAME FORWARD 
WITH THIS TESTIMONY. 
THE SECOND SHE SUBMITTED TO A 
LENGTHY, EMOTIONAL POLYGRAPH 
RECORD -- WE DIDN'T CALL FOR 
THE TESTER TO SIT BEFORE US SO 
WE COULD QUESTION HIM. 
THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT SHE 
WAS TRUTHFUL. AND IT IS NOW 
PART OF THE RECORD. 
NUMBER THREE, SHE REPORTEDLY 
CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE CLAIMS. 
FULLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT 
COULD SUBJECT HER TO CRIMINAL 
PENALTIES. 
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHEN 
YOU GET A CALL FROM A COMMITTEE 
STAFFER OR PARTISAN STAFFER 
VERSUS WHEN YOU GET A CALL FROM 
THE FBI. 
LYING TO THEM IS A FELONY. 
THAT IS A POWERFUL DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN A COMMITTEE 
INVESTIGATION AND AN FBI AGENT 
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE, CHASING 
AFTER FACTS, PULLING ON THE 
LOOSE THREADS THAT HAVE BEEN 
EVIDENT IN JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  
RECORD. 
FOURTH, SHE CAME FORWARD 
PUBLICLY DESPITE KNOWING SHE 
WOULD FACE HARSH PUBLIC 
SCRUTINY, THREATS, RELENTLESS 
INVASIONS OF PRIVACY. 
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE 
EFFECT ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHICH 
IS REAL  AND NOT EXAGGERATED. 
BUT THE EFFECT ON HER AS WELL, 
AND WHAT SHE HAD TO SUBMIT TO 
BY COMING FORWARD AND MAKING 
THAT COURAGEOUS TESTIMONY. 
NOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  TESTIMONY
STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO DR. 
FORD'S TESTIMONY. 
FIRST JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS 
EVERYTHING TO LOSE  SHOULD 
THESE BE FULLY INVESTIGATED AND 
PROVEN TRUE. 
EVERYTHING TO LOSE. 
THAT'S WHY HE DOESN'T WANT A 
FULL INVESTIGATION. 
SECONDLY, HE HAS GIVEN NUMEROUS 
OPPORTUNITIES TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN TO CALL FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION, AND IN BENEFIT --
AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION 
BUT HE IS REFUSED TO DO SO. 
IF I WAS IN THE BALANCE AND BE 
ACCUSED OF THINGS THAT WERE 
ALLIES, I WOULD BE DEMANDING 
EVERY BIT OF INVESTIGATION 
POSSIBLE. 
NOT JUST THE FBI. 
I WOULD BE CALLING FOR 
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS. 
I WOULD BE CALLING ON EVERY 
LOOSE THREAD. 
BUT HE HAS NOT. 
HE HAS REFUSED TO CALL FOR THIS 
COMMITTEE TO HEAR LIVE 
TESTIMONY FROM WITNESSES THAT 
COULD CORROBARATE  HIS STORY OR 
DR. FORD'S.  
THIRD, HIS TESTIMONY REGARDING 
HIS DRINKING HABITS HAVE BEEN 
CONTRADICTED BY SO MANY PEOPLE. 
HIS STATEMENTS HAVE PROVEN TO BE
NOT TRUE. 
HIS ROOMMATE HAS SAID THAT HE 
WAS FREQUENTLY INCOHERENTLY 
DRUNK AND THAT HE BECAME 
AGGRESSIVE AND BELLIGERENT. 
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT 
SAID THAT'S. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  FRIEND TO 
WHOM HE REFERRED TO NUMEROUS 
TIMES SAID IS NOT CREDIBLE FOR 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO SAY THAT HE 
HAS NO MEMORY  LAPSES IN THE 
NIGHTS THAT HE DRINK TO EXCESS. 
AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS, MR. 
CHAIRMAN, LYNN BROOKS WHO SAID 
SHE DID NOT WANT TO COME 
FORWARD, ANOTHER FRIEND FROM 
YALE, SHE IS A REPUBLICAN, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. SHE DID NOT WANT TO 
COME FORWARD BUT LAST NIGHT 
AFTER LISTENING TO HIS 
TESTIMONY, WAS SO OFFENDED BY 
HIS LIES THAT THIS IS WHAT HIS 
FRIEND FROM YALE, A REGISTERED 
REPUBLICAN SAID, THERE IS NO 
DOUBT IN MY MIND WHILE AT YALE 
HE WAS A BIG PARTY OR. HE OFTEN 
DRINK TO EXCESS. 
AND THERE HAD TO BE A NUMBER OF 
NIGHTS HE DOES NOT REMEMBER. 
IN FACT, I WAS WITNESSED TO THE 
NIGHT HE GOT TAPPED INTO HIS 
FRATERNITY AND WAS STUMBLING 
DRUNK AND HE WAS IN A RIDICULOUS
-- SAYING REALLY DUMB THINGS. 
I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE THAT 
THERE IS NO WAY THAT HE 
REMEMBERS THAT NIGHT. 
THIS IS A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN 
WHO DID NOT WANT TO COME 
FORWARD. 
THERE WERE MULTIPLE EMAILS AND 
TEXT CIRCLING AMONGST HER 
CLASSMATES ABOUT HOW KAVANAUGH 
WAS QUOTE  LYING TO THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  IN HIS 
TESTIMONY. 
THAT'S FROM A REPUBLICAN WHO 
DID NOT WANT TO COME FORWARD 
UNTIL SHE WITNESSED THOSE LIES. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S  
TESTIMONY OSTOMATE -- ALSO 
MISCHARACTERIZED WHAT THREE 
OTHER PEOPLE INDICATED. 
HE TOLD US AS HIS EXONERATING 
EVIDENCE -- HE KEPT MENTIONING 
THREE NAMES. 
HE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT FOUR 
PEOPLE WHO KNEW DR. FORD  WHO 
DR. FORD SAID WAS PRESENT  AT 
THE GATHERING SAID IT DIDN'T 
HAPPEN. 
THAT'S PATENTLY UNTRUE. 
MARK JUDGE SAID I HAVE NO 
MEMORY OF THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT.
PJ SMITH SAID HE HAS NO 
KNOWLEDGE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS. 
THAT IS NOT, IT DID NOT HAPPEN. 
LELAND KAISER HAS SAID THROUGH 
HER ATTORNEY SHE HAS NO 
RECOLLECTION OF BEING AT A 
PARTY OR GATHERING WHEN 
KAVANAUGH WAS PRESENT . THAT 
WAS NOT, IT DID NOT HAPPEN. 
IN FACT, LELAND KAISER HAS SAID 
SHE BELIEVES DR. FORD.  
THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS DENIED 
THIS IS TAKEN PLACE WHO SAYS IT 
DID NOT HAPPEN IS JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH.  
AND SO NOW THIS IS THE REAL 
POINT, SERVE. 
>> CAN YOU -- 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO FINISH, 
SERVE. 
-- SIR. 
>> YOU'VE GONE 70 MINUTES. 
I HAVE THREE OTHER PEOPLE WHO 
WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE. 
ARE YOU WILLING TO LET THREE 
OTHER PEOPLE SPEAK? 
>> I WANT TO FINISH MY COMMENTS.
YOU CAN LET WHOEVER SPEAK, 
SPEAK. 
>> GO AHEAD, SIR. 
>> HE CAN TAKE MY TIME. 
>> THIS NATION IS WATCHING. 
WHICH IS SAW ONE REPUBLICAN SO 
OFFENDED BECAUSE SHE KNOWS 
KAVANAUGH.  
THIS IS AMERICANS WATCHING 
RIGHT NOW TO SEE WHAT THIS BODY 
WILL DO. 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS OR 
PARTISANSHIP. 
I WILL FOREVER REMEMBER WHAT 
DR. FORD SAID WHEN SHE CAME 
BEFORE US. 
SHE WAS PERFORMING FOR CIVIC  
DUTY. 
SHE WASN'T TRYING TO DESTROY A 
MAN. 
SHE WAS A COURAGEOUS WOMAN 
TELLING HER TRUTH OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 
THIS IS WHAT WAS DONE TO ME, 
SHE SAYS. 
MANY COLLEAGUES SAID THEY FOUND 
DR. FORD CREDIBLE. 
BUT TO CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
YOU WOULD SAY THAT YOU DON'T 
BELIEVE HER ,  DR. FORD , BUT 
THAT YOU ARE SO CERTAIN THIS 
DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT YOU ARE 
WILLING TO FORCE A VOTE NOW 
WITHOUT ANY FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION. 
AT BEST, THIS MEANS YOU THINK 
SHE WAS CONFUSED AND DOESN'T 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. 
EVEN THOUGH YESTERDAY SHE TOLD 
US SHE REMEMBERS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH  COVERING HER MOUTH 
SEARED INTO HER MEMORY, 
EXPRESSING FEAR THAT HE MIGHT 
ACCIDENTALLY KILL HER. 
SHE TOLD US DETAILS FROM 2012, 
2013, 2016, AND 2017. 
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE IN THE 
UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW. 
THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT. 
IT IS A MORAL MOMENT. 
WE DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE THIS 
VOTE TODAY. 
WE CAN CORRECT FROM THE 
MISTAKES OF THE PAST IN THIS 
NATION. 
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, 
MEN AND WOMEN, SURVIVORS OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO ARE WATCHING 
THIS BODY OF POWERFUL PEOPLE 
AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 
THIS TOXIC CULTURE, THIS 
PERNICIOUS PATRIARCHY HAS TO 
STOP. 
IT IS REAL IN THIS COUNTRY. 
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. 
THERE WATCHING THIS BODY RIGHT 
NOW. 
CHILDREN ABUSED, WATCHING WHAT 
PEOPLE SWEEP IT ASIDE, DENY, 
ATTACK. 
PEOPLE IN CORPORATIONS OR NEWS 
MEDIA OUTLETS WHO ARE ABUSED 
AND HARASSED FOR YEARS AND 
THEIR TESTIMONY, THEIR TRUTH 
WAS SWEPT ASIDE, BELITTLED. 
THEY WERE VILIFIED. 
THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY 
INVESTIGATORS. 
MILLIONS ARE WATCHING THIS BODY 
AND HOW WE ACT. 
WILL WE BRUSH ASIDE A CREDIBLE 
WITNESS TESTIMONY? WILL WE 
BELITTLE AND ATTACK CREDIBLE 
TESTIMONY? 
WILL WE IGNORE CREDIBLE 
TESTIMONY? 
WILL WE LISTEN? 
WILL WE BELIEVE? 
IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW, 
THERE ARE DARK CORNERS OF THE 
CULTURE. 
THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL 
REPORTS ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE 
AMERICAN WOMEN, ONE OUT OF 
THREE, WILL EXPERIENCE SOME 
FORM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. 
ONE OUT OF SIX MEN. 60% OF THEM 
GO UNREPORTED. 
AND THERE ARE THOSE RIGHT NOW 
WATCHING THIS GROUP OF POWERFUL 
PEOPLE. HOW WILL WE DEAL WITH A 
PRIVILEGED MAN? 
A SEAT ON THE SUPREME COURT IS 
NOT AN ENTITLEMENT. JUST 
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE CAPTAIN OF 
YOUR BEST BALL TEAM, THIS IS NOT
AN ENTITLEMENT. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS IS NOT A 
COURT OF LAW. 
WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT THIS MAN 
IS GUILTY OF WHAT YOU SAID. 
THE QUESTION IS, DO WE KNOW 
ENOUGH NOW TO DELAY THIS? 
OR WE GOING TO RUSH TO PUT 
SOMEONE ON THE SUPREME COURT 
WITH THIS CLOUD HANGING OVER 
THEM? 
I CANNOT STOMACH THAT WE ARE 
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD, THAT WE 
ARE GOING TO SAY TO WOMEN 
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND TO MEN 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- 
>> I THINK THAT QUESTION YOU 
JUST ASKED IS A GOOD PLACE TO 
STOP. 
>> I WILL STOP WITH THIS. 
I WILL STOP WITH THIS. 
WITH RESPECT FOR THIS COMMITTEE 
AND RESPECT FOR YOU, I CANNOT 
SIT HERE, I CANNOT PARTICIPATE 
IN WHAT IS GOING TO BE A DARK 
MOMENT AGAIN, THE SAME WAY WE 
LOOK AT THE ANITA HILL TRIALS. 
I CANNOT PARTICIPATE. I 
CONCLUDE MY REMARKS, WE SHOULD 
NOT BRUSH ASIDE HER COMMENTS. 
WE SHOULD NOT BELITTLE HER 
TESTIMONY. 
WHICH LISTEN TO HER. WE SHOULD 
LISTEN TO WOMEN. 
WE SHOULD THOROUGHLY 
INVESTIGATE THIS BEFORE MOVING 
FORWARD. TO DO ANY OTHER THING 
IS TO DISS MINUTES -- DIMINISH 
THE TRUTH. AND TO AGAIN, 
RELEGATE OURSELVES TO WHAT I 
BELIEVE IS A DARK, DARK ELEMENT 
OF SOCIETY. 
WITH THAT, I WILL LEAVE. 
>> SENATOR KENNEDY. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
IN MY JUDGMENT, THERE WERE NO 
WINNERS IN THIS ROOM YESTERDAY. 
NONE. 
ALL I SAW WERE TWO PEOPLE -- TWO
HUMAN BEINGS IN PAIN. 
ALL OF US IN MY OPINION, 
INCLUDING DR. FORD AND  JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH  HAVE A BLINKERED 
PERSPECTIVE. WHATEVER HAPPENED, 
HAPPENED 40 YEARS AGO. 
AND THAT IS JUST A FACT. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO 
DR. FORD.  
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WILL EVER 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO DR. FORD. 
I DO BELIEVE  THAT SOMETHING 
VERY, VERY, VERY BAD HAPPENED 
TO DR. FORD. 
AND I'M VERY SORRY.  
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH  WAS INVOLVED. 
AND THAT'S WHY I WILL SUPPORT 
HIS NOMINATION. 
LET ME TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT
I'M A LITTLE MORE CERTAIN OF, 
AND I WILL BE BRIEF, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
THIS HAS BEEN, AS SOMEONE PUT 
IT IN AN ARTICLE THIS MORNING, 
A GROTESQUE CARNIVAL. 
IN MY OPINION, THIS HAS BEEN AN 
INTERGALACTIC FREAK SHOW. 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, 
CONGRESS HAS HIT ROCK BOTTOM 
AND STARTED TO DIG. AND ALL OF 
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED, 
EVERY BIT OF IT. THE OTHER 
THING I AM CERTAIN OF IS THAT 
THESE GAMES, THIS CHARACTER 
ASSASSINATION HAS DAMAGED DR. 
FORD  AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH  AND 
THEIR FAMILIES IRREPARABLY. 
AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. 
NOW, SENATOR FEINSTEIN TALKED 
ABOUT THIS EARLIER AND SHE IS 
RIGHT. 
HOW WE TREAT WOMEN IN AMERICA 
DOES MATTER. 
THIS IS NO COUNTRY FOR CREEPY 
OLD MEN. YOUNG MEN, MIDDLE-AGED 
MEN, -- BUT THIS IS NO COUNTRY 
AT ALL IN MY OPINION, NOT THE 
KIND OF COUNTRY I WANT TO LIVE 
IN WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. BOTH 
THE ACCUSER AND THE ACCUSED IS 
ENTITLED TO RESPECT, AND 
FAIRNESS, AND YES, TO DUE 
PROCESS. 
TO THE PERSON WHO LEAKED DR. 
FORD'S  LETTER, TO THE PERSON 
WHO BREACHED DR. FORD'S  
ANONYMITY, AND TO THE PERSON 
WHO DID NOT TELL HER SHE COULD 
HAVE AVOIDED THIS BY TESTIFYING 
PRIVATELY IN HER HOME IN 
CALIFORNIA, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
. YOU SHOULD BOW YOUR HEAD IN 
SHAME IN MY OPINION AND YOU 
SHOULD HANG -- HIDE YOUR HEAD 
IN A BAG FOR EVERYDAY FOR THE 
REST OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE. 
AND YOU ALSO OUGHT TO READ 
SOMETHING. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE IN 
GOD OR IF YOU READ THE BIBLE BUT
THERE IS WISDOM IN A PASSAGE IF 
YOU READ THE BIBLE OR BELIEVE 
IN GOD OR NOT. 
AND I WOULD REFERRED YOU TO 
MATTHEW 16. WHAT IS A PERSON 
PROFITED? FOR WHAT IS A PERSON 
PROFITED IF HE GAINS THE ENTIRE 
WORLD AND HE LOSES HIS SOUL? 
THANK, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THESE TOTALLY -- THE GAVEL. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> YOU YIELDED YOUR TIME. 
>> I YIELDED PART OF MY TIME TO 
SENATOR BOOKER. 
TO HAVE ANY LEFT? 
>> YOU MAY PROCEED. 
>> I WILL YIELD MY TIME TO HIM, 
MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT 
GRACIOUSNESS AND I HOPE IT IS A 
SIGN THAT WE WILL REBUILD 
ACROSS THE AISLE. 
YESTERDAY, THERE WERE WORDS 
SPOKEN AND WE KNOW IN FAMILIES 
THAT WORDS ARE SPOKEN IN ANGER 
AND SOMETIMES IN THE MOMENT THAT
WE LATER WALKED BACK. 
THOSE WORDS YESTERDAY FROM 
MEMBERS ACROSS THE AISLE TO 
DECIDE -- TO THIS SIDE WERE 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
I KNOW THEY WOULD SAY SOME OF 
OUR WORDS TO THEM MAY BE ON THE 
SAME LEVEL. 
BUT WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER, 
TRAVELED TOGETHER, WE HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY TOGETHER TO DO 
THE BUSINESS OF THE UNITED 
STATES SENATE. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU MAY NOT AGREE 
WITH ME BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF 
WORKING TOGETHER, A DELAY WOULD 
BE APPROPRIATE. 
I'M HERE TO MAKE A LAST APPEAL 
THAT WE AVOID THE RUSH TO 
JUDGMENT WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR 
YOUR POSITION. THE SESSION 
YESTERDAY WAS A JOB INTERVIEW 
AND IT IS A JOB INTERVIEW FOR A 
POSITION UNLIKE ANY OTHER. 
I HAVE TREMENDOUS REVERENCE FOR 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER 
IN THE COURTS AND MY BELIEVE IS 
THAT THIS DECISION ON HOW TO 
VOTE -- AND I WILL VOTE NO, IS 
AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT I WILL 
MAKE AS A UNITED STATES 
SENATOR. 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
DESERVES NOT JUST A GOOD NOMINEE
BUT THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB.
AND THE PERSON THAT WE SAW COME 
BEFORE US YESTERDAY WAS FILLED 
WITH SUCH RANCOR AND -- SUCH 
ANGER, THAT I CANNOT ACCEPT 
THAT HE WOULD BE AN IMPARTIAL 
AND OBJECTIVE JUSTICE ON THE 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. 
TO DESCRIBE MEMBERS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE AS A LEFT-WING 
CONSPIRACY TO THREATEN UNITED 
STATES SENATORS, I SIMPLY 
CANNOT ACCEPT. 
WE ARE INTERVIEWING -- OR WE 
WERE INTERVIEWING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH FOR  A POSITION THAT 
IS A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO 
THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 
HE CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT 
THROUGH IMPEACHMENT. 
AND HE WILL BE THERE FOR 
DECADES TO COME. 
I MADE NO SECRET OF MY 
OPPOSITION TO HIM BASED ON HIS 
OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM VIEWS AND 
JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY, HE IS 
APPARENT GOAL TO CHIP AWAY, IF 
NOT OVERTURN ROE V WADE AND THE 
GUARANTEES THAT ALLOW WOMEN TO 
DECIDE WHEN AND IF THEY BECOME 
PREGNANT AND HAVE CHILDREN, THE 
DECISION BY MILLIONS OF 
AMERICANS TO MARRY THE PERSON 
THEY LOVE, WORKERS RIGHTS, THE 
POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT WHICH I 
THINK WOULD BECOME AN IMPERIAL 
PRESIDENCY IF HE BECOMES A 
JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT. 
BUT YESTERDAY, MY OPPOSITION 
SOLIDIFIED BECAUSE OF 
TEMPERAMENT AND FITNESS WHICH I 
BELIEVE HE LACKS. 
BY VIRTUE OF THE SCREED THAT HE 
SAT HERE AND GAVE US HIS VIEWS 
STILL ARE DISQUALIFYING FOR ME 
BUT HIS CHARACTER AND FITNESS 
OUGHT TO BE A REASON FOR ÃºEVERY 
WE SAW EYEWITNESS YESTERDAY OF 
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CHARACTER 
AND TEMPERAMENT. 
A WOMAN WHO TOLD US HER STORY 
IN STEADY, EVEN, HELPFUL TERMS. 
A STORY THAT WAS DEEPLY PAINFUL 
FOR HER. AND SHE HAS ENDURED 
THREATS AND PUBLIC ASSASSINATION
, CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, 
PUBLIC SHAMING THAT NO ONE 
SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER. 
MY HEART GOES OUT TO HER AS 
WELL AS TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  
FAMILIES -- FAMILY. 
THESE COMMENTS HAVE NO THREAT IN
-- NO PLACE IN PUBLIC COURT -- 
DISCORD. 
SHE HAS EVERY REASON TO REMAIN 
SILENT AND NO INCENTIVE 
PERSONALLY TO COME FORWARD 
EXCEPT TO DO A PUBLIC SERVICE 
FOR THE NASCENT DESIGNATION AS 
SHE STATED. 
HER STORY WAS POWERFUL, 
COMPELLING, PERSONAL. 
I BELIEVE HER. 
I HAVE TO DISBELIEVE AN ANGRY 
AND DEFIANT MEN WHOSE STORY 
SIMPLY DOES NOT HOLD UP. HE 
CLAIMED THAT THE FBI ALREADY 
INVESTIGATED HIM BECAUSE THEY 
DID A BACKGROUND CHECK SIX 
TIMES. 
THE FBI NEVER INVESTIGATED DR. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S  
ALLEGATIONS. 
IT NEVER INVESTIGATED JULIE 
SWETNICK'S  ALLEGATIONS. 
THOSE ARE GAPS IN THE WORK THAT 
REMAIN TO BE DONE. 
IN FACT, THE ABA ISSUED A 
STATEMENT SUPPORTING AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION INTO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH  ACCORDING TO A 
COLLEAGUE. 
THE RATING IS THE GOLD STANDARD.
THE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS MAY 
BE CONSCIENTIOUS AND DEDICATED 
BUT THEY ARE SIMPLY NO 
SUBSTITUTE FOR THE TRAINED 
PROFESSIONALS WITH THE 
EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE OF FBI 
AGENTS.KAVANAUGH REFUSED TO MAK 
THAT REQUEST. 
DR. BLASEY FORD DID SO. 
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE 
HIDING, WHAT IS THE 
ADMINISTRATION CONCEALING, WHY 
HAVE WE NOT RECEIVED THOSE 
MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS 
THAT REMAIN HIDDEN? 
WHY HAS JUDGE KAVANAUGH NOT 
TAKEN A POLYGRAPH? 
HE SAYS THEY'RE NOT RELIABLE. 
AND THAT THE POLYGRAPH DR. FORD 
SUBJECTED HERSELF TO WAS 
MEANINGLESS. 
SHE PASSED IT. 
AS A JUDGE ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH RULED THAT THEY 
ARE IN FACT MEANINGFUL. 
HE WROTE, QUOTE, LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE 
POLYGRAPHS TO TEST THE 
CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES AND 
CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS, REFUSING 
TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS FAILED THAT TEST. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH CLAIMED THAT 
ALL FOUR WITNESSES, DR. BLASEY 
FORD IDENTIFIED AS BEING 
PRESENT AT THE PARTY HAVE SAID 
THAT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT, QUOTE, 
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 
ONLY ONE PERSON HAS SAID THE 
SEXUAL ASSAULT DIDN'T HAPPEN, 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
DR. BLASEY FORD IDENTIFIED SAID 
THEY DO NOT REMEMBER THE 
INCIDENT. 
THAT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE. 
DO NOT RECALL IS A DIFFERENT 
STATEMENT THAN IT DIDN'T 
HAPPEN. 
AND THE OTHER WOMAN DOCTOR 
BLASEY FORD NAMED WHO WAS THERE 
HAS SINCE PUBLICLY STATED THAT 
SHE BELIEVES DR. BLASEY FORD'S 
ACCOUNT. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TRIED TO GIVE 
HIMSELF AN ALIBI, MAKING IT 
SOUND LIKE HE DIDN'T DRINK ON 
WEEKNIGHTS. 
HIS OWN HIGH SCHOOL CALENDAR 
WHICH HE PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE 
AS EVIDENCE CONTRADICTS THAT 
STATEMENT. 
DURING THE HEARING AND AN 
EXCHANGE WITH MY COLLEAGUE 
SENATOR BOOKER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
ADMITTED THAT ONE OF THE 
ENTRIES ON HIS CALENDAR FROM A 
THURSDAY SIGNIFIED THAT HE WENT 
TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE TO DRINK. 
HE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HE 
NEVER IN HIS LIFE DRANK SO MUCH 
THAT HE COULDN'T REMEMBER. 
NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO SPENT 
CONSIDERABLE TIME WITH HIM 
DURING THE HEARING IN HIGH 
SCHOOL, DURING HIS HIGH SCHOOL, 
COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL YEARS 
CONFIRMED THAT HE FREQUENTLY 
DRANK TO EXCESS AND SOMETIMES 
BECAME BELLIGERENT. 
FINALLY, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
CLAIMED THAT HE HAS ALWAYS 
TREATED WOMEN WITH DIGNITY AND 
RESPECT, HIS WORDS, YET HE AND 
HIS HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS NAMED 
ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS RONATTA 
DAUPHIN IN THEIR YEARBOOK PAGE 
SAYING THEY WERE HER ALUM NEWS, 
REDUCING HER TO A SEXUAL 
CONQUEST. 
THAT IS NO WAY TO TREAT WOMEN 
WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. 
IN FACT, SHE ATTESTED TO THE 
PAIN THAT IT HAS CAUSED HER. 
HE WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT 
THESE BRAVE COURAGEOUS SEXUAL 
ASSAULT SURVIVORS HAVE COME 
FORWARD AS PART OF A VAST RIGHT 
WING CONSPIRACY. 
HOW INSULTING TO THEM TO SAY 
THAT THEY ARE PAWNS OR PUPPETS 
OF US OR ANYONE ELSE. 
IN FACT, THEY ARE BRAVE 
COURAGEOUS INDEPENDENT WOMEN 
WHO HAVE STEPPED FORWARD. 
SO I WANT TO SAY IN CONCLUSION 
TO THE MEN OF AMERICA, FOR YOU 
I HOPE THIS WILL BE A TEACHING 
MOMENT NOT TOO DENTIGRATE 
ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN A SURVIVOR 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT TO LIFT 
THEM UP. 
I WANT TO ENTER INTO THE RECORD 
THE STORIES OF A NUMBER OF 
CONSTITUENTS OF MINE WHOSE 
PAIN, SADNESS, SHAME, SELF-
DOUBT, GUILT, FEAR POWERFULLY 
ATTESTED TO IN THESE 
STATEMENTS, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION, SO 
ORDERED. 
>> THEY ARE THE HEROS HERE. 
DR. BLASEY FORD IS A PROFILE IN 
COURAGE. 
AND I WANT TO SAY TO HER SONS, 
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR 
MOTHER. 
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR 
MOM. 
SHE IS A PROFILE IN COURAGE, 
AND HER NAME WILL BE IN THE 
HISTORY BOOKS LONG AFTER OURS 
ARE GONE. 
SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS 
SOMEONE WHO STEPPED FORWARD 
TRULY TO SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. 
WE USE THAT PHRASE A LOT. 
SHE DID IT YESTERDAY, AND I AM 
PROUD TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE DR. 
BLASEY FORD AND I HOPE THAT HER 
TWO SONS AND HER HUSBAND ARE AS 
PROUD OF HER AS WE SHOULD BE. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
AND WITH THAT, I WILL POSE -- 
OPPOSE THE NOMINEE AND I WILL 
STEP OUT. 
>> WE'LL STAND AT EASE UNTIL 
THE FALL OF THE GAVEL. 
>> WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THE 
ACTION ON CAPITOL HILL. 
WE SEE THERE SENATOR GRASSLEY. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ED 
O'KEEFE. 
HE JOIN US NOW FROM CAPITOL 
HILL. 
ED, I TOOK THE KIDS TO THE BUS 
STOP THIS MORNING AND A MOM 
STOPPED ME TO SAY WHY ARE ALL 
THERE THESE VOTES TO HAVE A 
VOTE ON THE VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH. 
CAN YOU SORT OF EXPLAIN AND 
WALK US THROUGH THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS AND PARTICULARLY THIS 1:30 
VOTE WE'RE EXPECTING, ED, WHAT 
IS IT? 
WHAT IF THE DEMOCRATS DON'T 
SHOW UP? 
>>REPORTER:  YOU KNOW, THE NICE 
THING ABOUT THESE MOMENTS, 
REENA, IS IT REMINDS EVERYONE 
OF EXACTLY HOW THINGS ARE 
SUPPOSED TO WORK. 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE AT 1:30 IS A 
VOTE OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
ON THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION 
ITSELF. 
YOU GOT 11 REPUBLICAN, 10 
DEMOCRATS. 
I PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE CHEAT 
SHEET FOR MYSELF. 
FOLKS AT HOME MIGHT WANT TO 
GOOGLE THEIR NAMES AND WRITE 
THEM ALL OFF AND YOU MIGHT WANT 
TO CHECK THEM OFF AS THEY GO 
HERE IN A LITTLE BIT. 
ONCE THAT VOTE HAPPENS AND HE 
IS REPORTED OUT OF THE 
COMMITTEE FAVORABLY, WE EXWK 
THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO START 
IN THE FULL -- WE EXPECT THAT 
THINGS ARE GOING TO START IN 
THE FULL SENATE TOMORROW 
MORNING. 
THEY'LL HOLD A VOTE TO LAUNCH 
FULL SENATE DEBATE ON THE 
NOMINATION. 
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER PROCEDURAL 
VOTE AT SOME POINT ON MONDAY, 
AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE 
ACTUAL FINAL CONFIRMATION VOTE 
WOULD OCCUR ON TUESDAY. 
A FEW THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND. 
IF FOR SOME REASON HERE IN THE 
NEXT FEW MINUTES IT ENDS UP 
BEING THAT A MINORITY OF THE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS VOTE FOR 
KAVANAUGH INSTEAD OF THE 
MAJORITY, IT STILL GETS 
REFERRED TO THE FULL SENATE, 
AND IT'S UP TO THE SENATE 
LEADER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT 
TO HOLD THAT VOTE AND STILL 
CONSIDER THE NOMINATION. 
IT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST. 
IT'LL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, AND 
MITCH McCONNELL HAS SAID THAT 
WIN OR LOSE IN THE COMMITTEE, 
HE'S BRINGING THE NOMINATION TO 
THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. 
WE'RE STILL AT THIS POINT 
WAITING ON THE FATE OF ABOUT WE 
THINK ONLY FOUR SENATORS ACROSS 
THE 100-MEMBER BODY. 
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE, THE 
REPUBLICAN, LISA MURKOWSKI, 
REPUBLICAN OF ALASKA, JOE 
MANCHIN OF WEST VIRGINIA AND 
HEIDI HEITKAMP DEMOCRAT OF 
NORTH DAKOTA. 
AT THIS POINT THEY'RE REALLY 
THE ONLY FOUR WHO HAVEN'T SAID 
WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO. 
WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE STILL 
MULLING THAT DECISION AND 
BASICALLY THEY'VE GOTTA SHOW 
THEIR CARDS BY SATURDAY MORNING 
WHEN THAT FIRST PROCEDURAL VOTE 
HAPPENS. 
AND AT THAT POINT IT 
ESSENTIALLY GIVE US A SENSE OF 
HOW THE VOTE WOULD GO ON 
TUESDAY AND WE START TO LOSE 
SOME OF THE DRAMA AND THE 
UNCERTAINTY AROUND ALL THIS. 
SO IT'S THE NEXT FEW MINUTES 
HERE WHERE WE NOW ANTICIPATE IT 
WILL BE AN 11-10 VOTE WHERE -- 
AND THAT ESSENTIALLY THEN 
BEGINS THE FORMAL PROCESS OF 
TAKING IT TO THE FULL SENATE. 
>> AND, ED, I HEARD SENATOR 
McCONNELL SAY THAT EVEN IF THEY 
DON'T VOTE THIS OUT OF 
COMMITTEE IN JUDICIARY, HE'S 
STILL GOING TO TAKE IT UP IN 
THE SENATE, IS THAT -- IS WHAT 
I'M HEARING ACCURATE, AND CAN 
HE DO THAT? 
>>REPORTER:  YES. 
YES. 
AS SENATE LEADER HE HAS THE 
ABILITY TO DO THAT. 
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO OVERRIDE 
COMMITTEES AND BRING ANYTHING 
HE WANTS TO THE FLOOR. 
THAT'S THE AWESOME OF POWER 
THAT WHOEVER IS SENATE LEADER 
HAS. 
IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS 
OF THE SENATE IN RECENT YEARS 
UNDER DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN 
CONTROL THAT THE LEADERS CAN 
BASICALLY DO WHATEVER THEY WANT 
AND BYPASS THE COMMITTEES WHICH 
TRADITIONALLY HAVE HELD MUCH 
MORE POWER IN ULTIMATELY 
DECIDING WHAT GETS DECIDED BY 
THE FULL SENATE. 
>> YOU'RE SO RIGHT, ED, ABOUT 
THESE PROCEDURES. 
IT GIVES US A WINDOW INTO 
EXACTLY HOW CONGRESS RUNS. 
WE SEE HERE SUSAN COLLINS AND 
SENATOR MURKOWSKI, EXACTLY 
WAITING TO SEE WHAT THESE 
POTENTIAL SWING VOTERS, WHERE 
THEY MIGHT TURN. 
ED, I WANT TO THANK YOU. 
WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU 
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AS 
HE'S GOT THE LATEST. 
>>>  I WANT TO BRING IN NOW CBS 
NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG. 
WEIJIA, WHAT'S BEEN ABOUT THE 
IMPENDING VOTE ON KAVANAUGH? 
>>REPORTER:  WE DID HEAR FROM 
THE OFFICIAL SPOKESPERSON FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO HAS BEEN 
TALKING TO REPORTERS FROM THE 
VERY BEGINNING ABOUT THIS 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND THAT 
IS RAJ  SHAH. 
HE SPOKE THIS MORNING RIGHT 
HERE ON THE NORTH LAWN OF THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
AND HE SAID HE'S VERY 
CONFIDENT. 
HE HASN'T BEEN GIVEN ANY 
ASSURANCES FROM ALL THE 
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE A VOTE IN 
THIS, BUT HE BELIEVES THAT 
ULTIMATELY KAVANAUGH WILL BE 
CONFIRMED. 
SO THE MOOD HERE IS VERY 
UPBEAT. 
OFFICIALS I THINK WERE 
BREATHING A COLLECTIVE SIGH OF 
RELIEF AFTER THEY WERE ABLE TO 
HEAR KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY 
BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE POINT 
THAT I THINK THEY WERE SHAKEN 
AFTER JUST HEARING FROM DR. 
FORD. 
OFFICIALS SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, 
STAFFERS WERE WORRIED, FRANKLY, 
BECAUSE HER TESTIMONY WAS ALSO 
SO POWERFUL AND COMPELLING AND 
THEY WERE NOT SURE WHAT THEY 
WOULD GET FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME WE SAW 
HIM ANSWERING QUESTIONS WAS 
DURING A NEWS INTERVIEW, AND IT 
WAS A VERY DIFFERENT KAVANAUGH. 
HE WAS SUBDUED, HE WAS ALMOST 
ROBOTIC, AND HE RECEIVED 
CRITICISM FROM THAT OFFICIALS 
SAY FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT 
THE PRESIDENT VALUES 
PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN 
CAMERAS ARE ROLLING AND I THINK 
THAT HE BELIEVES THAT KAVANAUGH 
IN THAT INTERVIEW COULD HAVE 
DONE BETTER AND HE CERTAINLY 
DELIVERED YESTERDAY BEFORE THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
SO I THINK THERE'S AN 
OVERWHELMING SENSE OF RELIEF 
AND OPTIMISM HERE AS THEY WAIT 
FOR THESE VOTES TO COME 
THROUGH. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
WEIJIA JIANG. 
WEIJIA, WE WILL CHECK BACK IN 
WITH YOU AS WELL. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN OUR 
PANEL HERE. 
JOINING ME ON SET CAITLIN HUEY 
BURNS, A CBSN POLITICAL REPORT 
HE, NIALL STANAGE, A WHITE 
HOUSE COLUMNIST FOR THE HILL, 
LESLIE SANCHEZ, A CBSN 
CONTRIBUTOR AND REPUBLICAN 
STRATEGIST AND JOEL PAYNE WHO 
IS A DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST. 
OKAY, CAITLIN, I WANT TO START 
WITH YOU FIRST OFF. 
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING AND WHAT 
STANDS OUT TO YOU AS WE'RE 
WAITING ON THESE VOTE? 
>> WELL, I THINK JEFF FLAKE 
COMING OUT THIS MORNING AND 
SAYING HE WILL VOTE TO CONFIRM 
KAVANAUGH I THINK REALLY 
CHANGED THE GAME IN TERMS OF 
OUR EXPECT ALLEGATIONS FOR THIS 
 REALLY NOT 
EXPLAINING WHERE HE WAS ON THIS 
VOTE. 
YESTERDAY PUTTING, YOU KNOW, 
SAYING, YOU KNOW, KIND OF 
LAMENTING THE WHOLE PROCESS AND 
ALSO RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT, 
YOU KNOW, BELIEVABILITY AND WHO 
COMES -- WHO TO BELIEVE. 
HE WASN'T QUITE SURE HE HAD THE 
ANSWERS. 
MORNING HE KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT. 
SO SAYING THAT THERE'S AS MUCH 
DOUBT AS CERTAINTY AS IT 
PERTAINS TO KAVANAUGH. 
SO IN FACT IF THE COMMITTEE 
DOES VOTE AS WE'RE EXPECTING AT 
2:00 TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH, THAT 
CERTAINLY GIVES HIM MOMENTUM, 
AND REPUBLICANS ARE ALREADY 
FEELING MOMENTUM AFTER 
YESTERDAY. 
THE KEY IS THE TIMING AND 
GETTING THIS DONE QUICKLY SO 
THAT THERE ISN'T ROOM FOR MORE 
POLLING, MORE REACTION FROM THE 
PUBLIC. 
THERE ARE THINGS THAT COULD 
INFLUENCE VOTES. 
>> NIALL, CAITLIN WAS TALKING 
ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN MOMENTUM, 
BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO 
CREATE THEIR OWN MOMENTUM LED 
BY KAMALA HARRIS. 
DO WE KNOW THOSE MODERATE RED 
STATE DEMOCRAT, DO WE KNOW HOW 
THEY'RE VOTING AT THIS POINT? 
>> WE DO IN A COUPLE OF CASES. 
AND THIS ACTUALLY BUILDS ON THE 
POINT THAT CAITLIN WAS MAKING 
ABOUT REPUBLICANS ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WE'RE SEEING 
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
EXPECTED TO BUCK THE PARTY 
LINE, NOT DOING SO. 
JOE DONNELLY IN INDIANA 
PARTICULARLY IS A PRIME EXAMPLE 
OF THAT. 
HE'S GOING TO VOTE AGAINST 
KAVANAUGH. 
I WAS SPEAKING WITH A 
REPUBLICAN SOURCE LAST NIGHT 
HOFF HAVING HEARD JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY BELIEVED 
A COUPLE OF RED STATE DEMOCRATS 
COULD BE FLIPPED ONTO THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE. 
THAT SOURCE WAS CLEARLY 
IMPLYING THAT DONNELLY COULD BE 
ONE OF THEM. 
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE. 
SO I THINK THAT SHOWS THAT 
WE'RE REALLY GOING BACK TO MORE 
PREDICTABLE LINES FOR THE MOST 
PART, EVEN THOUGH WE DO HAVE 
THE FOUR SENATORS, TWO ON EACH 
SIDE WHO ED MENTIONED, AND 
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ATTENTION 
IS GOING TO GO WHEN IT COMES TO 
A FULL SENATE VOTE. 
>> LESLIE, WHAT DO REPUBLICANS 
HAVE TO GAIN AT THIS POINT BY 
GETTING THIS THROUGH RIGHT 
AWAY? 
>> SURE. 
IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT 
CAMPAIGN PROMISE FOR THE 
PRESIDENT, AND YOU HAVE MANY 
FOLKS ESPECIALLY IN THE RED 
STATES WHO FEEL THAT THIS IS 
REALLY THE NOMINEE, THE RIGHT 
NOMINEE FOR THE SUPREME COURT, 
AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT ELSE IS 
SAID, LIKE SHE SAID, HE SAID, 
THAT THEY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT 
HE'S THE RIGHT CHOICE. 
AND THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS THAT 
HAVE THIS CONFLICT OF 
CONSCIENCES, YOU KNOW, THAT 
THEY DO FEEL THAT DR. FORD WAS 
VERY SYMPATHIZING CANDIDATE, 
VERY TRUTHFUL, AND THAT THERE 
IS SOMETHING THERE, BUT THEY'RE 
NOT WILLING TO GIVE A LOT OF 
DAYLIGHT BECAUSE THEY REALIZE 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS THIS DONE, 
THERE'S MOMENTUM BEHIND THE 
CANDIDATE AND THEY REALLY HAVE 
TO PUSH IT THROUGH. 
I JUST WONDER THE CONSEQUENCE 
AFTER THE MIDTERMS. 
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 
IS THERE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR 
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT? 
>> PARTICULARLY I THINK WOMEN. 
THERE'S NOT AN EASY SOLUTION. 
THERE'S A LOT OF LAYERS TO 
THIS. 
WHILE I SEE A LOT OF MY 
COLLEAGUES ESPECIALLY IN RED 
STATES, THEY FEEL THAT 
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN TO DR. 
FORD BUT IT'S MISTAKEN 
IDENTITY. 
I THINK IT'S JUST THIS WAY OF 
RECONCILING A VERY DIFFICULT, 
TRAUMATIC SITUATION IN A WAY 
THAT'S DIGESTIBLE, BUT I DON'T 
THINK IT'S THAT EASY. 
AND DOI THINK THE CONVERSATION 
IS GOING -- AND I DO THINK THE 
CONVERSATION IS GOING TO 
CONTINUE, THE LEGITIMACY OF A 
PARTISAN NOOM KNEE, THAT'S 
GOING TO CONTINUE AS WELL. 
>> I THINK CAITLIN WHO SAID 
THIS WAS A CAMPAIGN PROMISE 
THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE ABOUT 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
HE'S TRYING TO FULFILL THESE 
PROMISES. 
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS -- 
WHETHER KAVANAUGH GETS THROUGH 
OR NOT, HOW IS IT GOING TO 
AFFECT 2020? 
>> WELL, THIS IS INTERESTING. 
SO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE 
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS ON THE 
PANEL, RIGHT? 
THINK ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS, CORY 
BOOKER, SOME OF THE MORE 
OUTSPOKEN FOLKS. 
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS WALKED OUT 
EARLIER, LOOK AT THE ONES WHO 
ARE STAYED, THEY ARE THE 
INSTITUTIONALISTS, THE DICK 
DURBINS, THE PAT LEAHYS, THE 
DIANNE FEINSTEINS, THOSE WHO 
REALLY DON'T HAVE A FUTURE IN 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
THOSE WHO DO, DICK BLUMENTHAL, 
MAZIE HIRONO, BOOKER, HARRIS, 
THEY NEEDED TO SHOW THE BASE 
THAT THEY HAD SPINE, AND THAT 
REALLY IS KIND OF THE WORD OF 
THE DAY FOR ME FOR DEMOCRATS IS 
SPINE. 
DO THEY HAVE ENOUGH STEEL IN 
THEIR SPINE TO SHOW THAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO RESIST, 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO 
SAY I DISAGREE WITH THIS 
NOMINATION, I'M AGAINST IT, YOU 
HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE 
ACTIVELY GOING TO RESIST THIS 
PRESIDENT. 
THAT'S WHAT THE BASE IS 
EXPECTING. 
>> YOU KNOW, NIALL, ONE THING I 
KEEP HEARING OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN FROM REPUBLICANS, AND 
PARTICULARLY FEMALE REPUBLICANS 
I'VE SPOKEN TO, THEY COULD 
BRING THIS UP WAY EARLIER, WHY 
DID THEY PULL THESE DIRTY 
POLITICAL TRICKS AND TRY TO 
BRING THIS UP AT THE LAST 
MINUTE ON THE 11th HOUR? 
>> THAT IS DEFINITELY AN 
ARGUMENT WE'RE HEARING ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE A LOT. 
I THINK IT'S CLEARLY IN THE 
REPUBLICAN INTEREST TO SUGGEST 
THAT THIS IS ALL POLITICAL -- 
THE MORE POLITICIZED IT IS, THE 
BETTER IT IS FOR BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S CHANCES OF 
CONFIRMATION. 
BUT JUST TO PICK UP ON LESLIE'S 
POINT, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 
WE'RE ALL IN THE INSTANT 
REACTION BUSINESS, BUT 
YESTERDAY'S TESTIMONY WAS SO 
POWERFUL THAT I THINK WE'RE 
ONLY REALLY BEGINNING TO WORK 
THROUGH THE RAMIFICATIONS OF 
THAT WHICH COULD BE SEEN 
CERTAINLY IN THE MIDTERMS BUT 
ALSO BEYOND THAT. 
IF REPUBLICANS ARE PERCEIVED TO 
BE DISMISSIVE OF A WOMAN WHO 
DID BRING FORTH VERY CREDIBLE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
>> YOU COULD ALMOST POINT TO -- 
SO 2016 WAS A TURNING POINT FOR 
A LOT OF WOMEN TO SAY, OH, WE 
WANT TO GET INVOLVED, WE DON'T 
LIKE THIS, KIND OF THE COARSING 
OF THE CULTURE AND A LOT OF THE 
SEXISM THEY FELT, SEXIST 
COMMENTS. 
MORE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN THAN 
REPUBLICAN, BUT MORE WOMEN ARE 
RUNNING IN 2018. 
THERE IS A DIRECT CAUSE EFFECT 
THAT YOU SEE. 
AND I THINK WITH YOUNGER WOMEN 
OR MILLENNIAL WOMEN, WOMEN THAT 
ARE GETTING ENGAGED, IT'S NOT 
AN EASY CHOICE ANYMORE. 
IT'S REALLY -- YOU KNOW, THAT'S 
WHY SENATOR FLAKE AND SOME OF 
THESE OTHERS ARE HAVING SUCH A 
DIFFICULT TIME NOW IN THIS NEW 
POPULIST REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT 
IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT IS REALLY 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO? 
AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY 
WOMEN THAT FEEL THEY WANT TO 
KNOW MORE AND RUSHING THIS 
THROUGH WHICH IS A SLEUD 
POLITICAL MOVE IS -- SHREWD 
POLITICAL MOVE, IT'S ADVAN 
TEENAGOUS TO THE PARTY. 
BUT WHERE DO WE GO AFTER THAT? 
>> IT'S FUNNY. 
WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS PICKED 
INSTEAD OF AMY CONEY BARRETT, 
EVERYBODY SAID, OH, I THINK THE 
PRESIDENT DECIDED TO STAY OUT 
OF A CULTURE WAR. 
IF YOU PICK CONEY BARRETT, 
THAT'S A CULTURAL WAR THAT HE'S 
DOING TO RIAL UP HIS BASE. 
THIS HAS TURNED INTO A CULTURE 
WAR. 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS 
EARLIER. 
THINK ABOUT THE INSIDE TALK OF 
WHAT IT'S LIKE AT SOME OF THESE 
PREP SCHOOLS, THESE CLUBBY TYPE 
OF ENVIRONMENTS AND THINGS OF 
THAT NATURE AND LOOK AT THE 
REACTION OF FOLKS LIKE LINDSAY 
GRAHAM, RIGHT? 
IT FEELS VERY EXCLUSIVE AND IT 
DOESN'T FEEL VERY INCLUSIVE. 
THIS IS NOT A FACE TO AMERICA 
THAT SHOWS THAT THERE'S A LOT 
OF INCLUSIVITY. 
IT FEELS LIKE, AGAIN, THIS IS A 
CULTURE WAR LIKE WHOSE SIDE ARE 
YOU ON. 
IT FEELS LIKE THIS CAME UP HERE 
UNEXPECTEDLY. 
>> THAT WAS CERTAINLY A MOMENT, 
ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN. 
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN. 
CAITLIN, AT THIS POINT 
DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED MANY 
THINGS. 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS, 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE VOTING 
POWER, IS THERE ANYTHING THEY 
CAN DO AT THIS POINT TO KEEP 
KAVANAUGH OFF THE COURT? 
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW THEY'RE 
TRYING TO APPLY PLEASURE NOT 
ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN CAUCUS 
TOGETHER, BUT TO APPLY PRESSURE 
ON LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND 
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE. 
WE'VE SEEN THAT OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF WEEKS IN TERMS OF THE 
ADVERTISING DOLLARS 
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT THOSE 
TWO SENATORS. 
SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO 
CREATE MOMENTUM TO PUT THE 
PLEASURE ON THOSE TWO SENATORS 
WHO HAVE BEEN SWING VOTES IN 
SOME CASES, HEALTHCARE WAS A 
GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY COULD DO. 
IF IN FACT MURKOWSKI AND 
COLLINS AND THE REPUBLICAN 
CONFERENCE STAY TOGETHER AND 
PERHAPS PULL OFF SOMEONE LIKE A 
JOE MANCHIN WHO IS RUNNING FOR 
RE-ELECTION IN A STATE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS OVERWHELMINGLY 
POPULAR, THAT COULD INCENTIVIZE 
DEMOCRATS TO REALLY REV IT UP 
IN NOVEMBER AND SAY -- START TO 
KIND OF USE THE SUPREME COURT 
AND JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS AS AN 
ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE THE WAY 
THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE FOR 
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. 
>> AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE 
WHO ARE NOT LEAVING IT UP TO 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
TODAY WE ACTUALLY SAW SOME 
PROTESTERS IN AN ELEVATOR 
CONFRONTING SENATOR JEFF FLAKE 
AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HE WOULD 
VOTE YES. 
>> I TOLD IT BECAUSE I 
RECOGNIZED DR. FORD'S STORY 
THAT SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH. 
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ALLOWING 
SOMEONE  TO SIT 
IN THE SUPREME COURT. 
THIS IS HORRIBLE. 
YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN YOUR 
FAMILY. 
THINK ABOUT THEM. 
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN. 
 WHAT ARE 
YOU DOING, SIR? 
>> I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE AND 
YOU'RE TELLING ALL WOMEN THAT 
THEY DON'T MATTER, THAT THEY 
SHOULD JUST STAY QUIET BECAUSE 
IF THEY TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED 
TO THEM, YOU'RE GOING TO IGNORE 
THEM. 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME 
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING 
ALL WOMEN IN AMERICA. 
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING 
ALL WOMEN IN AMERICA. 
NEW ZEALAND IALL, AT THIS POINT 
DO -- NIALL, AT THIS POINT DO 
WE KNOW WHAT PLAYED INTO JEFF 
FLAKE ANNOUNCING HE'S GOING TO 
VOTE YES? 
>> I DON'T THINK WE CAN LOOK 
INSIDE OF HIS HEAD. 
I THINK JEFF FLAKE HAS BEEN 
SOMEONE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN 
VERBALLY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, BUT THOSE ON THE LEFT 
SAID HE HAS NOT QUITE WALKED 
THE WALK THE WAY HE'S TALKED 
THE TALK. 
AND OBVIOUSLY THAT FOOTAGE YOU 
SHOWED WAS VERY EMOTIONALLY 
POWERFUL. 
WHERE JEFF FLAKE IS CONTESTING 
RE-ELECTION AGAIN, THAT COULD 
BE PROBLEMATIC, BUT HE'S NOT. 
I THINK THE FACT HE'S LEAVING 
THE SENATE MAKES IT A LITTLE 
BIT MORE SURPRISING TO SOME 
PEOPLE THAT HE HAS CHOSEN TO 
VOTE THE WAY HE HAS. 
HE HAS NOTHING TO LOSE 
ESSENTIALLY POLITICALLY 
SPEAKING. 
>> LESLIE, WALK US THROUGH THE 
POLITICS IN THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY AT THIS POINT WHETHER YOU 
VOTE YES OR WHETHER YOU VOTE 
NO. 
>> WHEN YOU VOTE YES -- THE ONE 
THING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, AND 
I TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, 
THERE USED TO BE KIND OF THIS 
WHISPER ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, 
AND HE'S TALKED ABOUT IT 
BEFORE, THE REPUBLICANS THAT 
ARE THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON 
THAT ARE AGAINST HIM, BUT AS HE 
CONTINUES TO WIN, GAINS 
MOMENTUM AND HE IN THE MIDTERMS 
WHERE YOU EXPECT A LARGE LOSS 
TRADITIONAL FIRST-TERM 
PRESIDENT, IT MAY ONLY BE FIVE 
OR SIX WHEN IT ALL SHAKES OUT. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS MANAGED TO 
HOLD THE LINE, SO THAT WHISPER 
-- THAT ROAR, EXCUSE ME, THE 
ROAR AGAINST THE PRESIDENT HAS 
NOW BECOME A WHISPER. 
SO THE PRESIDENT HAS THE 
MOMENTUM, THEY REALIZE THAT 
THIS IS ABOUT VOTES AND KIND OF 
THEIR OWN POLITICAL SKIN. 
THAT'S THE CALCULATION THAT'S 
HAPPENING HERE. 
BUT, AGAIN, WHAT WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT IS THIS IS MORE 
NUANCED THAN THAT. 
WHAT ARE WE SEEING AS THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHAT DO WE 
FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE IN AT ANY 
COST? 
AND I THINK THE IRONY HERE, AS 
YOU SEE ALL THIS EMOTION, AND 
THEY'RE SAYING IF -- THE 
EMOTION AROUND THESE WOMEN WHO 
ARE TALKING ABOUT THESE 
CHARGES, BUT IT'S THE 
REPUBLICAN MEN RIGHT NOW WHO 
HAVE SO MUCH EMOTION, NOT ONLY 
WITH KAVANAUGH, BUT LINDSAY 
GRAHAM AND SOME OF THESE 
OTHERS. 
SO I THINK WE'RE JUST LOST IN 
TERMS OF WHERE THIS IS GOING TO 
BE, WIN AT ALL COST, BUT THE 
FUTURE RAMIFICATIONS ARE 
UNKNOWN. 
>>I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU -- 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF 
IMPASSIONED ARGUMENTS ON BOTH 
SIDES. 
SENATOR DIANE DIANNE FEINSTEIN 
HAD THIS TO SAY ACTUALLY ABOUT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S BEHAVIOR 
DURING THE HEARING YESTERDAY. 
>> THIS WAS NOT SOMEONE WHO 
REFLECTED AN IMPARTIAL 
TEMPERAMENT OR THE FAIRNESS AND 
EVENHANDEDNESS ONE WOULD SEE IN 
A JUDGE. 
THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS 
AGGRESSIVE AND BELLIGERENT. 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE WHO 
WANTS TO BE ELEVATED TO THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN OUR COUNTRY 
BEHAVE IN THAT MANNER. 
>> SENATOR KLOBUCHAR ACTUALLY 
TOLD "CBS THIS MORNING" THAT IF 
SHE HAD ACTED THE WAY KAVANAUGH 
DID IN THE COURTROOM, SHE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT AT THIS 
POINT. 
JOEL, IS THIS JUST A DEMOCRATIC 
TALKING POINT ABOUT 
TEMPERAMENT? 
>> NO. 
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS 
YESTERDAY, I THINK THAT 
KAVANAUGH MAY HAVE WON THE 
BATTLE FOR SAVING HIS SKIN FOR 
THE DAY IN TERMS OF THE 
BELIEVABILITY. 
BUT I THINK HE LOST THE WAR. 
I DON'T THINK HE SHOWED HIMSELF 
TO HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
AGAIN, I BROUGHT THIS UP. 
IF YOU'RE A GROUP THAT'S 
PROGRESSIVE OR THAT'S, QUOTE, 
LEFT WING AND YOU'RE COMING FOR 
THE COURT, IF YOU'RE A PLANNED 
PARENTHOOD, IF YOU'RE SOMEONE 
WHO OBVIOUSLY FALLS ON THE LEFT 
SIDE, I MEAN, THIS IS AN IDEA 
LOG, A SERIOUS IDEALOGUE, NOT 
JUST IN THE ABSTRACT, THIS IS 
SOMEBODY WHO IS A POLITICAL 
OPERATIVE FOR THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY WHO'S NOW GOING TO BE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT IT SEEMS 
LIKE. 
SO I THINK THAT'S GOTTA BE 
REALLY TROUBLING. 
ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO 
MENTION HERE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE 
THINKING ABOUT WHO'S VOTING AND 
HOW PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT 
VOTING. 
IF YOU'RE JOE MANCHIN, OKAY, 
JUST READING THE TEA LEAVES, IT 
ACTUALLY WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR 
YOU IF YOU WERE GOING TO BE A 
NO VOTE ON KAVANAUGH TO DO IT A 
LITTLE BIT EARLIER, KIND OF DO 
WHAT JOE DONNELLY DID A LITTLE 
BIT EARLIER TODAY, NOT BE THE 
LAST ONE OUT. 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE GAME OF 
HOT POTATO, WHO'S LEFT HOLDING 
THE BAG AT THE END. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT. 
SO THAT TELLS ME A LITTLE 
SOMETHING ABOUT MAYBE WHAT 
MANCHIN IS THINKING WITH NO 
INFORMATION TO WORK OFF OF. 
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE, YOU 
KNOW, BOXED IN AS THE LAST 
PERSON, THE PERSON WHO'S REALLY 
IN THE TARGET ZONE, YOU'D 
PROBABLY WANT TO ANNOUNCE YOUR 
DECISION A LITTLE EARLIER. 
THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME 
INSIGHT INTO WHAT JOE MAN DLIP 
CHIN MIGHT BE THINK -- MANCHIN 
MIGHT BE THINKING. 
>> I KNOW SOME OF THIS IS 
SUSPENSE AND THEE AT RICKS AND 
DRAMA AND COO BOOKIE BOOKIE KA 
BOOKIE THEATER. 
DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 
RIGHT NOW? 
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS ON 
THE PART OF MAPCHIN AND COLLINS 
AND MUR -- MANCHIN, COLLINS AND 
MURKOWSKI. 
WE'RE HEARING REPORTS THAT 
COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI ARE 
DISCUSSING MOVING TOGETHER 
PERHAPS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. 
THAT WILL BE FASCINATING IF IT 
HAPPENS YES IT IS -- YOU WOULD 
THINK IT WOULD BE CLEAR ENOUGH 
BY NOW, BUT I THINK THERE'S 
GENUINE SUSPENSE AND GENUINE 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THIS VOTE 
STILL. 
>> I WANT TO CHING IN -- CHECK 
IN WITH ANGELICA ALVAREZ. 
WHAT'S THE LATEST THERE? 
>>REPORTER:  HI, YES. 
WE ARE WAITING ON THAT VOTE, IT 
SHOULD BE COMING AT 1:30. 
IN THE MEANTIME, WE'VE BEEN 
HEARING FROM THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND HEARING 
FROM BOTH SIDES, A LOT OF 
PASSION ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH 
SIDES OF THE AISLE, REPUBLICANS 
 
WE HEARD YESTERDAY, SIMPLY 
ANGRY ABOUT THE PROCESS 
ACCORDING TO THEM. 
IN THEIR OPINION THEY FEEL THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE REALLY 
MISTREATED JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
EVEN DR. FORD. 
WE'RE ALSO HEARING ANGER FROM 
THE DEMOCRATS' SIDE. 
THEY ARE UPSET THAT THEY HAVE 
NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION, THEY'VE ASKED 
FOR IT REPEATEDLY AND THEY HAVE 
ALSO SAID THAT THEY HAVE NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO SWAY REPUBLICANS 
TO DELAY THE VOTE. 
>> ALL RIGHT, ANGELICA. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
I WANT TO TURN BACK NOW TO OUR 
PANEL. 
LESLIE, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
THIS, I THINK THERE WAS A COOK 
REPORT LAST WEEK, THERE'S 
CONCERN THAT PARTICULARLY THE 
HISPANIC VOTING BLOCK MIGHT NOT 
COME OUT TO VOTE IN MIDTERMS 
WHICH I HAVE TO SAY I WAS 
SURPRISED. 
IF THERE'S ONE SECTOR OF THIS 
COUNTRY THAT HAS A LOT TO LOSE, 
IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE THIS 
GROUP. 
SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
THE HISPANIC VOTERS AND WHO DO 
YOU THINK IN PARTICULAR IF 
KAVANAUGH DOES MAKE IT ONTO THE 
COURT, WHO DOES THIS MOBILIZE 
MORE? 
>> THE INTERESTING PART, WE 
HAVE WANTED FOR GENERATIONS FOR 
LATINOS OR ANY MINORITY GROUP 
TO REALLY BE GALVANIZED AND 
VOTE TO THEIR NUMBERS, TO THEIR 
POLITICAL POWER, BUT THEY 
DON'T. 
BUT THE ISSUE WITH LATINOS IS 
THEY TEND TO TURN OUT MORE IN 
NATIONAL ELECTIONS THAN 
MIDTERMS BECAUSE THEY IDENTIFY 
WITH THE PERSON WHO'S AT THE 
TOP OF THE TICKET, NOT THE 
PARTY. 
WE DID A LOTZ OF POLLING FOR 
YEARS AND IF YOU SAY YOU KNOW 
WHAT? 
YOU KNOW, JUST THE REFERENCES, 
THE ELEPHANT AND THE DONKEY, 
WHICH IS WHICH, YOU HAVE A LOT 
OF NEW VOTERS WHO DON'T NASAILY 
KNOW. 
SO THE STEREOTYPES THAT THE 
PARTIES FALL INTO, IT'S NOT AN 
EASY LINE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR NEWER 
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. 
BUT ON THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT, WHETHER IT IS 
THE RAIDS, WHETHER IT IS THE 
DREAMERS, WHETHER IT'S BUILDING 
THE WALL, THERE'S CERTAINLY A 
LOT OF CONVERSATION. 
I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IS 
YOU HAVE MORE CANDIDATES 
RUNNING. 
THE POLITICAL POWER, WHETHER 
IT'S GENDER OR ETHNIC IT'S 
ACTUALLY WHEN PEOPLE RUN AND 
GAL SLP VANNIZE, NOT WHEN THEY 
VOTE BECAUSE THEY DON'T TURN 
OUT, BUT WHEN THEY DECIDE TO 
THROW THEIR HAND IN THE RING 
AND RUN AND RAISE MONEY AROUND 
THAT, THAT'S WHEN THAT STARTS 
TO BECOME SO INTERESTING. 
>> CAITLIN, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN 
A CONCERN THAT DEMOCRATS AREN'T 
ABLE TO GET THE VOTE OUT, 
ESPECIALLY MIDTERMS, IT'S ALL 
ABOUT TURNOUT. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHAT ARE THEY 
MOST CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW? 
>> WELL, CERTAINLY THE PRIMARY 
SHOWED AN INTENSE LEVEL OF 
ENTHUSIASM AMONG DEMOCRATIC 
VOTERS WHICH IS REMARKABLE FOR 
A PRIMARY AND ALSO MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS, BECAUSE AS WE KNOW 
REPUBLICANS TEND TO TURN OUT IN 
HIGHER NUMBERS THAN DEMOCRATS 
JUST IN TERMS OF THEIR VOTING 
BASE MORE OLDER VOTERS TEND TO 
BE MORE RELIABLE IN TURNING 
OUT. 
THE BIG QUESTION I HAVE IS 
THERE A CEILING FOR DEMOCRATIC 
ENTHUSISM, IN OTHER WORDS, CAN 
THEY BE MORE MOBILIZED AND 
ENERGIZED THAN THEY ALREADY 
ARE. 
AND SOME DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS 
SAY THAT THE SUPREME COURT 
COULD START TO BECOME SOMETHING 
THAT REALLY MOTIVATES PEOPLE, 
KIND OF CRYSTALLIZES THE 
IMPORTANCE OF SHOWING UP TO 
VOTE. 
SO NOT ONLY EXPRESSING ENERGY 
AND ENTHUSIASM AND SAYING 
YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE, BUT 
ACTUALLY TURNING OUT TO VOTE. 
THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF 
COMPLACENCY, RIGHT? 
WE SAW THAT A LITTLE BIT 
LEADING INTO 2016 WHERE 
DEMOCRATS WERE LOOKING AT THE 
NATIONAL POLLS AND SEEING 
CLINTON AHEAD AND THERE WASN'T 
THE TURNOUT THAT SHE NEEDED TO 
WIN THE ELECTION. 
THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT 
DEMOCRATS WON'T TURN OUT AT THE 
LEVEL THAT THEY'RE EXPRESSING 
NOW. 
SO IT'S TRYING TO KEEP YOUR 
BASE REVVED UP BUT ALSO TO GET 
THEM OUT TO ACTUALLY VOTE. 
OF COURSE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
CORE CONSTITUENCIES THAT WE'RE 
LOOKING AT AND WOMEN, 
PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE 
SUBURBS, IN THESE DISTRICTS 
THAT COULD DECIDE CONTROL OF 
CONGRESS HOW THEY WILL REACT TO 
KAVANAUGH, WHETHER THEY REACT 
TO IT INDIVIDUALLY OR TAKE IT 
IN THE AGGREGATE, I THINK THERE 
ARE STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 
AND WOMEN AS WE KNOW ARE NOT A 
MONOLITHIC GROUP, SO YOU'VE HAD 
SOME -- TRUMP LIKES TO SAY HE 
WON WOMEN VOTERS, THAT'S NOT 
TRUE, BUT HE WON A MAJORITY OF 
WHITE WOMEN VOTERS, SO THEY 
MIGHT REACT TO KAVANAUGH 
DIFFERENTLY. 
THEN YOU HAVE WOMEN LIVING IN 
OTHER AREAS OR -- IT JUST 
REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW THEY'RE 
KIND OF DIGESTING AND ABSORBING 
THIS WHICH, AGAIN, SPEAKS TO 
THE TIMELINE WHY REPUBLICANS 
WANT TO GET THIS OUT NOW. 
>> SPEAKING OF TIMELINE, I WANT 
TO REMIND EVERYONE YOU'RE 
WATCHING RIGHT HERE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ANY MOMENT 
NOW WE ARE THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE TO VOTE TO VOTE ON 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
IT'S A VOTE TO GET IT TO THE 
VOTE TO GET IT TO THE VOTE. 
DID I GET THAT RIGHT, GUYS? 
>> YOU MISSED ONE VOTE MAYBE. 
>> I MISSED ONE VOTE. 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE THIS 
OUT OF COMMITTEE, AND THEN 
TOMORROW WE ARE EXPECTING 
POTENTIALLY THIS WILL GO TO THE 
SENATE. 
A LOT CAN HAPPEN AS WE HAVE 
DISCOVERED IN JUST ONE DAY. 
WE ARE EXPECTING 1:30, THOUGH, 
THIS IS WHEN THE VOTE IS 
EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE. 
WE DO KNOW -- NIALL, I WANT TO 
GO BACK TO YOU ABOUT THIS, 
THOSE FOUR DEMOCRATS WHO CHOSE 
TODAY TO WALK OUT. 
TAKE US BACK AND SORT OF 
EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED TODAY. 
>> SO ESSENTIALLY CHUCK 
GRASSLEY THE REPUBLICAN 
CHAIRMAN WAS READING A 
STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF 
KAVANAUGH, AND AT THAT POINT 
FOUR DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WALKED 
OUT. 
THE MOST PROMINENT AMONG THEM 
IS SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS OF 
CALIFORNIA. 
SHE'S ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS 
MOST' PERSUASIVE QUESTIONERS I 
THINK IN THAT -- DEMOCRATS' 
MOST PERSUASIVE I THINK 
QUESTIONERS BUT A MORE CERTAIN 
CANDIDATE IN 2020. 
SO I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO 
THE KIND OF JOCKEYING FOR 
POSITION THAT JOEL WAS TALKING 
ABOUT. 
IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR 
OR ANY DEMOCRAT WHO HAS 
THOUGHTS OF RUNNING IN 2020, 
YOU CAN'T REALLY GET TOO FAR TO 
THE LEFT. 
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GET TOO 
ADAMANT IN YOUR OPPOSITION TO 
THIS GUY, SO IT WAS INTERESTING 
TO ME THAT HARRIS WAS LEADING 
THAT GROUP, WAS TAKING TO THE 
LEAD IN TALKING TO REPORTERS AT 
AN IMPROMPTU  NEWS CONFERENCE 
AFTERWARD, REALLY PUTTING 
HERSELF IN THE VAN GARD 
POSITION. 
>> WE ARE WATCHING THE SENATORS 
OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, LINDSAY GRAHAM, 
ORRIN HATCH AS WELL. 
I BELIEVE I JUST SAW CHUCK 
GRASSLEY TAKING HIS SEAT ALONG 
WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WHISPERING 
AND HOVERING OVER. 
CURIOUS TO KNOW. 
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE 
WHISPERING. 
LINDSAY GRAHAM IS CERTAINLY 
BEING PRAISED AMONG REPUBLICAN 
CIRCLES FOR STANDING UP. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WAS WRONGLY ACCUSED 
AND HE IS VERY MUCH RIDING THE 
COURSE BECAUSE THIS IS SO 
POLITICIZED, AND IT'S PART OF 
THESE DEMOCRAT SHANNON BEGANS 
AND A SMEAR CAMPAIGN WHICH IS 
ALL TALKING POINTS OF THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION. 
BUT THE CAUTION I WOULD GIVE, 
AGAIN, SAYING THERE'S TWO SIDES 
TO THIS IS LOOK AT THE OTHER 
OUTSIDE INSTITUTIONS, WHETHER 
IT BE HARVARD UNIVERSITY, YALE, 
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, 
THEY'RE SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD 
TAKE A SECOND HERE. 
AND THE REASON I SAY WE POINT 
TO THAT, REPUBLICANS COULD SAY 
IT'S THE IVORY TOWER, IT'S THE 
ELITE INSTITUTIONS WHO ARE 
REALLY BEING CRITICAL OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, BUT I THINK IT'S 
ABOUT THE MONEY. 
IT'S ABOUT THE TRUSTEES, THE 
DONORS, THE PEOPLE THAT ATTEND 
THESE UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE 
SAYING, WAIT A MINUTE, THERE IS 
SOMETHING HERE THAT NEEDS TO BE 
EVALUATED, WE HAD NEED -- WE 
NEED TO TAKE A SECOND MORE, AND 
BECAUSE SUCH POWERFUL 
INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING THAT I 
THINK IT WILL HAVE A RIPPLE 
EFFECT, NOT NECESSARILY DENYING 
THE CONFIRMATION TO SUPREME 
COURT, BUT WILL HAVE A RIPPLE 
EFFECT IN HOW WE LOOK AT THIS 
PROCESS, WHETHER WE ARE SEEN AS 
AN EGREGIOUS EFFORT TO HAVE 
THIS CLOUD OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
POTENTIALLY OUT THERE AND 
REALLY WHAT THE STANDARD IS 
GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE. 
WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GO BACK 
TO WHERE WE ARE BEFORE THE 
KAVANAUGH HEARING. 
>> THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT 
WE HAVEN'T UNPACKED MUCH, BUT 
IT IS JUST A VERY SERIOUS 
SITUATION WITH THE SUPREME 
COURT WHETHER YOU LOOK AT 
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO GET THROUGH 
MERRICK GARLAND, YOU LOOK RIGHT 
NOW WITH KAVANAUGH, HAS THE 
LITMUS TEST OF HOW YOU PROCEED 
FORWARD IN GETTING SOMEONE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT, IS IT JUST 
PARTISAN AND THAT'S IT AND 
WE'VE JUST ACCEPTED IT? 
>> SO I ACTUALLY THINK -- YOU 
KNOW, WE WERE TALKING EARLIER 
ABOUT THE COURT AS AN 
ORGANIZING ISSUE FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. 
HISTORICALLY DEMOCRATS REALLY 
HAVE NOT ORGANIZED AROUND THE 
COURT, REPUBLICANS HAVE. 
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT'S WHY 
THEY'VE PACKED THE COURT SO 
SUCCESSFULLY IN THE LAST, YOU 
KNOW, TWO DECADES, EVEN AT THE 
LOWER LEVELS. 
BUT NOW THIS IS EMERGING AS A 
LEADING ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS, 
AND THIS IS THE ULTIMATE LITMUS 
TEST, RIGHT? 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE CLEAREST 
EXAMPLE OF YOU SHOWING YOUR 
PUSHBACK TO DONALD TRUMP IS 
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN 
EFFECTIVELY ARTICULATE A CASE 
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH AND, 
AGAIN, IT'S A 20/20 TEST THAT 
IS VERY, VERY SERIOUS, AND, BY 
THE WAY, IT'S NOT JUST THESE 
FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE. 
IT'S GOVERNORS, IT'S GOING TO 
BE HOUSE CANDIDATES, IT'S GOING 
TO BE PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY WHO ARE RUNNING AGAINST. 
THIS IS SETTING UP TO BE A REAL 
ORGANIZING ISSUE FOR BOTH 
SIDES. 
>> AND BECAUSE IT IS A LASTING 
LEGACY OF THE PRESIDENT, UNLIKE 
A POLICY OR A LAW THAT CAN BE 
UNRAVELED OR REPEALED AS 
DIFFICULT AS THAT HAS PROVEN TO 
BE, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO 
IMPEACH OR RESCIND A SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE, THAT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT TO DO. 
THIS IS A GENERATIONAL 
APPOINTMENT WHICH IS WHY 
ESPECIALLY FOR THIS SEAT 
BECAUSE IT WILL CHANGE THE 
MAKEUP OF THE COURT FROM A 
CONSERVATIVE STANDPOINT, THAT'S 
WHY THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL FOR 
PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S 
SUCH AN ENERGY AND, YOU KNOW, 
ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS. 
>> WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE, WE HAVE 
A REPORTING THAT GEORGE W. BUSH 
HAVE CALLED CERTAIN SENATORS 
THAT ARE ON THE FENCE SAYING I 
KNOW THAT KAVANAUGH WORKED VERY 
CLOSELY WITH BUSH, YOU SHOULD 
VOTE, THIS IS IMPORTANT. 
>> AND THAT SPEAKS TO THE WAY 
IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT 
FIGHT HAS GALVANIZED EVERYONE 
IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HAS 
BEEN KIND OF THE GLUE THAT 
KEEPS IT ALL TOGETHER. 
REMEMBER THERE WERE A LOT OF 
CONSERVATIVES WHO WERE OPPOSED 
TO DONALD TRUMP FOR A VARIETY 
OF DIFFERENT REASONS. 
>> THE BUSH FAMILY AMONG THEM. 
>> THE BUSH FAMILY AMONG THEM, 
YES. 
AND THE COURT WAS THE ONE ISSUE 
THAT THEY KIND OF COALESCED 
AROUND AND EVANGELICALS AS 
WELL. 
THIS HAS BEEN A DRIVING 
PRINCIPLE FOR THEM, AND SO THIS 
IS WHAT IS KEEPS THE PARTY -- 
KEEPING THE PARTY TOGETHER. 
>> NIALL, WE KNOW SENATOR 
MURKOWSKI, SENATOR COLLINS, 
WE'RE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY, DO 
WE KNOW, DO THEY HAVE A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP? 
>> DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE 
RELATIONSHIP. 
TES PRETTY TENSE THERE. 
-- IT'S PRETTY TENSE THERE. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TRIED TO 
KEEP THEM ON BOARD TO SOME 
EXTENT, HE CERTAINLY HAS NOT 
BEEN CRITICAL OF THEM AS HE DID 
THE BUSH FAMILY FOR THAT 
MATTER. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE IN THE 
SENATE, THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO 
MAKE THESE DECISIONS TO SOME 
EXTENT ON THEIR OWN INTERESTS, 
AND SOMEONE LIKE SUSAN COLLINS 
WHO HAS CREATED A NICHE FOR 
HERSELF POLITICALLY AS THAT 
MODERATE, AS THAT PERSON WHO IS 
WILLING TO BUCK THE PARTY LINE, 
I'M NOT SURE HOW SHE IS GOING 
TO BE TO TIE HERSELF COMPLETELY 
TO DONALD TRUMP. 
A LITTLE BIT OF DISTANCE THERE 
IS PROBABLY BENEFICIAL FOR HER, 
AND JUST ONE OTHER POINT 
QUICKLY, REENA, THIS ALL THAT 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO ME GETS 
TO THE FACT THAT THE COUNTRY IS 
SO POLARIZED AT THE MOMENT THAT 
THE SUPREME COURT HAD BEEN SORT 
OF THE LAST OF THE BASTION OF 
THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE CAN 
TRANSCEND PARTISAN LINES IF YOU 
WERE NOMINATED BY A DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENT OR A REPUBLICAN 
PRESIDENT, THAT DIDN'T MARK THE 
REST OF YOUR TENURE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
NOW I THINK WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO 
A POINT WHERE BOTH POLITICAL 
PARTIES SIMPLY SEE SUPREME 
COURT SEATS AS PART OF THE 
SPOILS OF THE ELECTION WINS. 
THAT'S A BIT OF A SHAME, BUT I 
THINK IT'S INEVITABLE. 
>> I'M SO SORRY. 
BUT ON HIS POINT, SO THE VENEER 
IS OFF ON KAVANAUGH. 
IT USED TO BE THIS IDEA, YES, 
HE'S A CONSERVATIVE JURIST, BUT 
HE WOULD BE IMPARTIAL AND 
UNBIASED. 
IT WAS A POLITICAL SPEECH 
TESTIMONY THAT HE GAVE 
YESTERDAY WHICH FOR EVEN 
CONSERVATIVES, ECONOMIC 
CONSERVATIVES WERE, LIKE, WOW, 
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE 
COME FROM A JUDGE, AND WE 
REALIZE HE'S DEFENDING HIS 
INTEGRITY, HE IS THE ACCUSED 
VERSUS BEING THE JUDGE, BUT 
THERE WAS A LINE HE CROSSED 
THAT WAS SO PARTISAN IT MADE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE PAUSE. 
AND TO CAITLIN'S POINT ABOUT 
THE EVANGELICALS, THE REASON 
THE GLUE WAS THERE WAS 
PROTECTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS, 
DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD 
WHICH THE PRESIDENT GAVE. 
THEY'RE WILLING TO BE BLIND FOR 
EVERYTHING ELSE TO HAVE THOSE 
PROTECTIONS YOU HAVE SOLELY 
THROUGH THE SUPREME COURT. 
SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO -- 
>> I KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE A 
POINT, BUT I JUST WANT TO TAKE 
YOU LIVE HERE FOR ONE SECOND TO 
GIVE YOU AN IMAGE HERE. 
THIS IS THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 
IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY, LOOK 
AT THOSE CHAIRS. 
A LOT OF SENATORS NOT IN THOSE 
CHAIRS. 
WE'RE HEARING FROM ED O'KEEFE 
ALL DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF THE 
HEARING ROOM AND A GOOD PORTION 
OF THE DEMOCRATIC STAFF, THOSE 
ARE THE PEOPLE WHO USUALLY SIT 
BEHIND THE SENATORS, THEY JUST 
EXITED THE HEARING ROOM. 
IT'S NOW 1:38 P.M. 
EASTERN, EIGHT MINUTES AGO THEY 
WERE SUPPOSED TO HOLD THIS 
VOTE. 
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS TO SHOW UP AND AS OUR 
ED O'KEEFE IS REPORTING, THEY 
DID NOT SHOW UP, AND THEIR OWN 
STAFFERS, THEIR DEMOCRATIC 
STAFFERS HAVE ACTUALLY EXITED 
THE ROOM. 
JOEL, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE? 
>> SO I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
MATH FOR A SECOND. 
>> MATZ, OKAY. 
>> NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITE 
TOPICS. 
LOOK, YOU DON'T GET TO BE 
MAJORITY LEADER UNLESS YOU CAN 
COUNT VOTES. 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. 
SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS, 
OKAY? 
51-49, OKAY. 
SO REPUBLICANS CAN ESSENTIALLY 
AFFORD TO LOSE TWO IF THEY 
REPLACE THEM WITH ONE DEMOCRAT 
OR THEY CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ONE 
AND THEN PENCE IS THE 
TIEBREAKER. 
SO YOU COULD POTENTIALLY SEE A 
SCENARIO HERE WHERE REPUBLICANS 
LOSE A MURKOWSKI, OKAY, BUT 
THEY REPLACE A MURKOWSKI WITH 
LIKE A MANCHIN OR A HEITKAMP, I 
THINK THAT'S FASCINATING, AND I 
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY 
INTERESTING DYNAMICS FOR A 
DEMOCRAT LIKE THAT WHO 
ESSENTIALLY GIVES DONALD TRUMP 
HIS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHEN 
HE COULDN'T EVEN KEEP HIS 
ENTIRE PARTY IN LINE. 
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY 
FASCINATING PHENOMENON THAT 
COULD EMERGE THIS AFTERNOON. 
AND WHILE JOE MANCHIN IS 
PROBABLY BULLET-PROOF IN A 
PLACE LIKE WEST VIRGINIA 
BECAUSE NO ONE IS GOING TO RUN 
TO THE LEFT OF HIM THERE, OR 
HIDIEST HEITKAMP IN NORTH 
DAKOTA, THE RAGE -- OR HEIDI 
HEITKAMP IN NORTH DAKOTA, THE 
RAGE, THE PROGRESSIVE WING OF 
THE PARTY, IF THAT WERE TO 
HAPPEN I THINK WOULD BE REALLY 
FASCINATING TO WATCH AND 
OBSERVE. 
>> DOES ANYBODY KNOW IF THE 
DEMOCRATS DON'T SHOW UP AT THIS 
POINT, DO THEY STILL HOLD THE 
VOTE? 
>> I BELIEVE THAT THEY DO. 
VIEWERS CAN THEN CALL IN AND 
COMPLAIN HOW WRONG I AM. 
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S CONSIDERED 
AN ABSENTIAN IF THEY DON'T SHOW 
UP. 
THIS IMAGE THAT IS BEING 
BROADCAST INTERNATIONALLY AT 
THIS POINT STREAMING LIVE THAT 
DEMOCRATS CHOSE NOT TO ATTEND 
AT 1:30. 
WE KNOW -- JOEL, YOU WERE 
TALKING TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE 
MATH. 
WE KNOW AT THIS POINT THAT THE 
REPUBLICANS, THEY HAVE THE 
MAJORITY, WE DON'T KNOW, DO 
THEY HAVE THE VOTES? 
WE'RE STILL WAITING TO SEE 
EXACTLY HOW FOLKS ARE VOTING ON 
KAVANAUGH, BUT WHAT MORE CAN 
THE DEMOCRATS REALLY DO AT THIS 
POINT? 
>> WELL, I THINK THIS IMAGE 
SPEAKS TO IT, RIGHT? 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE VOTES TO 
OVERTAKE THE MAJORITY IN THE 
SENATE, BUT THEY CAN DO A LOT 
TO CREATE VISUALS, TO CREATE 
SOME MOMENTUM TO CREATE EVEN 
MORE ENERGY TO APPLY EVEN MORE 
PRESSURE HAVING THIS IMAGE, 
REFUSING TO BE PART OF THIS, 
DELAYING THE VOTE AS MUCH AS 
THEY CAN TO ALLOW FOR, AGAIN, 
THE PUBLIC TO KEEP REACTING TO 
THIS IN REAL TIME. 
I THINK THESE ARE THE KINDS OF 
MANEUVERS THAT THEY CAN DO TO 
DO THIS AND REPUBLICANS ARE 
GOING TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS 
POLITICAL ON THEIR PART. 
>> JUST BRIEFLY, THOSE PICTURES 
THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT JUST 
NOW, I MEAN, THOSE ARE GOING TO 
BE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF 
NEWSPAPERS. 
THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE ALL 
THROUGH PEOPLE'S SOCIAL MEDIA 
FEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE LAST -- 
OR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, GETTING 
TO THE POINT THAT WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE 
DEGREE TO WHICH THIS HOUSE 
BECOMES SO POLARIZED, THE MAN 
MAY BE CONFIRMED TOTHE SUPREME 
COURT AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE 
THAT IMAGE AROUND HIM FROM THE 
OUTSET. 
>> TALK ABOUT PICTURES, THOUGH, 
AND I TALKED ABOUT OPTICS 
YESTERDAY, OKAY? 
THERE WERE SOME OPTICS THAT WE 
DIDN'T TALK. 
THERE'S AN IMAGE OF LINDSAY 
GRAHAM AND/ORIN HATCH AND 
OTHERS LAUGHING DURING THE 
MIDDLE OF THE PROCEEDINGS 
YESTERDAY WHICH WERE KIND OF 
CAUGHT FIRE, PARTICULARLY 
AROUND PROGRESSIVE TWITTER AS I 
LIKE TO CALL IT. 
THERE'S THESE IMAGES OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WHILE HE IS DEFENDING 
HIMSELF VERY ANG RILE DEFENDING 
HIMSELF, SOME VERY POWERFUL 
SHOTS. 
I THINK THIS IS ALSO ABOUT 
OPTICS A LOT OF THIS, THE 
OPTICS THAT YOU'RE HIGHLIGHTING 
HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM, BUT 
ALSO ALL THOSE, YOU KNOW, WHITE 
MEN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
WHO OPTED TO GIVE RACHEL 
MITCHELL THE GAVEL ESSENTIALLY 
YESTERDAY TO LEAD ON THEIR 
SIDE. 
THERE ARE SO MANY IMAGE, HOW 
ARE AMERICANS GOING TO PROCESS 
THIS, HOW ARE VOTERS GOING TO 
PROCESS THIS WHEN THEY GO TO 
THE POLLS IN TWO MONTH? 
>> AND TAKE THE GAVEL BACK. 
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS IMAGE. 
THIS WAS THE IMAGE -- I DON'T 
KNOW HOW CLOSE I CAN GET, THIS 
IS THE IMAGE IN "NEW YORK 
TIMES" TODAY. 
I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE HEADLINE 
FOR TOMORROW'S NEWSPAPER WILL 
BE NOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO 
HAVE THIS VOTE AND AS WE KNOW 
SENATOR McCONNELL HAS WEIGHED 
IN SAYING IT'S STILL GOING TO 
GO TO THE SENATE FLOOR. 
>> WELL -- 
>> THIS IS AGAIN -- YOU WIN THE 
BATTLE, MAYBE PERHAPS LOSE THE 
WAR. 
THE BATTLE IS THEY MUST GET 
THIS CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE CONFIRMED. 
THAT'S THE GOAL LYING BEFORE 
THE MIDTERM ELECTION. 
AND EVERYTHING ELSE PEOPLE HAVE 
RATIONALIZED IT'S A CASE OF 
MISTAKEN IDENTITY AND HE'S 
STILL A VERY STRONG JURIST. 
>> I JUST WANT TO WEIGH IN 
HERE. 
WE'RE GETTING SOME REPORTING, I 
BELIEVE THIS IS FROM OUR NANCY 
CORDES WHO'S SAYING THAT FLAKE 
HAS NOT APPEARED IN THIS 
HEARING ROOM, IS ONE OF THE 
PEOPLE MISSING, AS YOU CAN SEE 
WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND HERE. 
GRAHAM IS NOW GOING BACK TO AN 
ADJACENT ROOM. 
THE ONLY SENATORS THAT ARE 
CURRENTLY IN THIS HEARING ROOM, 
AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, I 
CAN'T SEE FULLY HERE, I SEE 
IT'S KENNEDY, HATCH, GRASSLEY, 
GRAHAM IS ACTUALLY IN THAT 
ROOM, SO KENNEDY, HATCH, 
GRASSLEY AND GRAHAM THE ONLY 
ONES IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW. 
>> IT'S SO STRANGE AND PEOPLE 
KEEP SAYING, OH, THIS STUFF, 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING FOR 
THIS F.B.I. 
INQUIRY AND THE WHOLE PROCESS 
HAS BEEN POLITICIZED, SO THERE 
IS TRUTH TO THAT THAT THEY 
SHOULD HAVE NEVER REVEALED THE 
IDENTITY OF DR. FORD, SHE 
DESERVED THAT. 
BUT NOW THAT IT'S IN THIS 
HEIGHTENED ENVIRONMENT, THERE 
ARE STILL QUESTIONS REMAINING 
ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, PRICE. 
D THIS IS NOT -- 
>> WHAT WOULD THAT PRICE BE, 
THOUGH, LESLIE? 
>> THIS IS NOT -- REENA, I WISH 
I COULD SAY ONE FOR ONE. 
THIS IS GOING TO PERCOLATE. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE TALKED 
ABOUT IN THE BEAUTY PARLORS, ON 
THE GOLF RANGE, AT THE ELITE 
BOARDING SCHOOLS, IN THE IVORY 
TOWER AND EVERYBODY IS GETTING 
A CAR WASH. 
THE INTERESTING PART, YOU 
TALKED ABOUT IT, PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING I SAW THIS, BUT I DIDN'T 
HEAR IT, MAYBE PERHAPS WE WERE 
GOING THROUGH AN AIRPORT, 
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY 
LISTENING, BUT REASONABLE 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHAT IS THE 
RUSH? 
CAN WE FINALLY JUST REALLY KNOW 
THE TRUTH HERE ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED? 
AND THAT'S THE REASON PEOPLE 
WHO ARE NOT POLITICAL, THAT 
THEY FEEL THAT A LITTLE BIT OF 
TIME WOULD GIVE IT A NATURAL 
INCLUSION, MORE PEOPLE WOULD 
COME OUT, HE'D BE CLEARED BY 
THE F.B.I. 
IF THAT WERE THE CASE, I FEEL 
THERE WOULD BE A LOT MORE 
COMFORT LEVEL AMONG WOMEN. 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A LUXURY 
THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> REALLY QUICKLY. 
I WAS GOING TO SAY, LESLIE, YOU 
BROUGHT UP EARLIER IS 
ESSENTIALLY THEY HAVE NO CHOICE 
IN WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. 
IS IT REALLY? 
I WOULD ARGUE IF YOU'RE A 
REPUBLICAN, THE BEST SCENARIO 
IS BRETT KAVANAUGH IS CONVINCE, 
HE WITHDRAWS, YOU PUT ANOTHER 
CONSERVATIVE WHO'S JUST AS 
STRONG AND YOU USE IT TO WHIP 
UP YOUR BASE THIS NOVEMBER. 
INSTEAD YOU HAVE AN OPPOSITE 
SITUATION WHERE NOW WOMEN AND 
DEMOCRATS ARE EVEN MORE 
GALVANIZED. 
>> I WANT TO INTERRUPT ONE 
SECOND. 
WE SEE FLAKE, FEINSTEIN, SOME 
OF THE DEMOCRATS EMERGING THERE 
AND GRASSLEY HAS ALSO ENTERED. 
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE 
DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN. 
WE ARE -- OUR CAPITOL HILL TEAM 
IS ON THE GROUND THERE, ALSO 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY 
WHAT WENT ON. 
BEN SASSE AS WELL. 
WE JUST SAW FLAKE ENTER AND 
EXIT A SHORT TIME AGO. 
LET ME ASK YOU GUYS, LET'S SAY 
FLAKE CHANGES HIS MIND, BECAUSE 
THESE AREN'T COMMITTED VOTES ÃºY 
>> WELL, ESSENTIALLY IT MEANS 
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD NOT 
HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE 
COMMITTEE UNLESS SOMETHING 
TOTALLY UNEXPECTED HAPPENS. 
THAT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS 
BLACK MARK AGAINST HIM. 
AND, REMEMBER, WE ALL TRY TO 
MAKE PRIXES ACCORDING TO 
PROCEDURE -- PREDICTIONS 
ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE, BUT 
UNEXPECTED THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 
THE FAMOUS VOTE WHERE JOHN 
MCCAIN VOTED AGAINST THE REPEAL 
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, HE 
HAD ACTUALLY VOTED ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE BEFORE THAT ON 
A PROCEDURAL MATTER AND THEN 
CHANGED HIS MIND. 
AND JUST TO GET BACK TO YOUR 
POINT THAT LESLIE RAISED. 
THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE KIND 
OF ISSUE THAT TRANSCENDS THE 
POLITICAL BUBBLE OR BURSTS OUT 
OF THE POLITICAL BUBBLE, I 
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, 
THAT CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S 
TESTIMONY HAD SUCH VISCERAL 
FORCE YESTERDAY. 
A FEMALE FRIEND OF MINE FROM 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC 
WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW, THAT 
COULD HAVE BEEN ME. 
SHE WAS WATCHING IT THINKING 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME. 
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF VISCERAL 
ISSUE THAT POLITICS TYPICALLY 
THROWS UP, AND I THINK THAT'S 
WHERE ITS POWER RESIDES AND 
THAT'S WHY IT IS STILL 
PECKLATING, WHY PEOPLE HAVE 
STILL -- PERCOLATING, WHY 
PEOPLE STILL HAVE NOT 
THOROUGHLY COME TO THEIR 
CONCLUDE OF WHAT IT MEANS. 
>> WE ARE JUST LEARNING -- WE 
SAW SENATOR FLAKE EXIT THE ROOM 
WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
THEY ARE NOW IN AN ADJACENT 
BACK ROOM DISCUSSING AND 
TALKING AT THIS POIMENT. 
WE KNOW THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
VOTE AS WE WERE EXPECTING 20 
MINUTES AGO, REALLY, IT'S NOW 
DELAYED, A SENATOR IN THE ROOM 
CONFIRMS THAT VIA TEXT MESSAGE 
THAT SOMETHING IS AFOOT 
INVOLVING SENATOR JEFF FLAKE OF 
ARIZONA. 
WHAT IS IT, HOW LONG THE 
PROCEEDING WILL BE DELAYED 
WHRKS WILL THIS VOTE HAPPEN -- 
WHEN WILL THIS VOTE HAPPEN, IT 
IS STILL UNCLEAR, IT'S STILL 
FLUID. 
THIS NOTE FROM ED O'KEEFE SAYS 
THE WORD OF THE DAY HERE FLUID. 
AND THERE'S ALSO A TOP 
DEMOCRATIC AIDE SAYING 
REGARDING FLAKE IT LOOKS LIKE 
HE IS WAVERING. 
I ASKED IF HE'S WAVERING ON 
KAVANAUGH OR WAVERING ON JUST 
HOLDING THE VOTE WITHOUT AN 
INVESTIGATION. 
HE DIDN'T KNOW. 
AND THIS IS A QUOTE, CAN'T 
TELL, I WASN'T IN THERE FROM 
THE START. 
SO EVEN FOLKS WHO ARE AIDES AND 
PART OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S 
GOING ON. 
>> REENA, I'LL SAY REALLY 
QUICKLY, THIS IS A REALLY 
FASCINATING THING BECAUSE SINCE 
PEOPLE BELIEVE IF YOU JUST GAVE 
IT A MINUTE, TO INVESTIGATE 
MORE, FIND OUT MORE, JUST CLEAR 
THE AIR SOME THAT IT WOULD COME 
TO ITS OWN NATURAL CONCLUSION. 
THAT'S A TERM WE HEARD THIS 
MORNING. 
WE HEARD ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON 
WHO SAID HIS WIFE CALLED HIM 
AFTER WATCHING THIS TESTIMONY 
AND SAID CAN YOU TAKE SOME TIME 
NOW BECAUSE I NEED TO SPEAK TO 
YOU ABOUT THIS, AND SHE JUST 
REALLY HAD TO PROCESS THIS WITH 
HER HUSBAND BECAUSE THIS 
BROUGHT UP A LOT OF EMOTION. 
AND THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT 
IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR FAMILY 
AND THEIR CHILDREN AND THE 
PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW. 
SO THIS IS GENERATING -- WHICH 
IS WHAT I'M SAYING -- 
CONVERSATIONS IN WAYS THAT 
PEOPLE JUST CANNOT FULLY 
PROCESS IN 24 HOURS. 
THEY NEED A SECOND. 
AND TO RUSH THIS, THAT'S MY 
CHALLENGE TO REPUBLICANS, IF 
HE'S A GOOD ENOUGH NOMINEE, HE 
CAN STAND THE TIME. 
BUT THEY FEEL WHICH IS FAIR, A 
WAVE IS COMING. 
>> LESLIE, HOLD ON ONE SECOND. 
SENATOR GRASSLEY HAS GAVELED 
IN. 
>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ACTION 
OVER THE MOTION THAT'S BEFORE 
US. 
WE GOTTA MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE 
HAVE A QUORUM. 
>> AS A POINT OF PERSONAL 
PRIVILEGE, I'M GOING TO CALL ON 
SENATOR FLAKE TO SPEAK. 
NORMALLY WE WOULD START THE 
VOTE RIGHT NOW, BUT AS A POINT 
OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE, I WOULD 
CALL ON SENATOR FLAKE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH A 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER 
SIDE. 
WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS 
ONGOING FOR A WHILE WITH REGARD 
TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO DUE 
DILIGENCE HERE, AND I THINK IT 
WOULD BE PROPER TO DELAY THE 
FLOOR VOTE FOR UP TO BUT NOT 
MORE THAN ONE WEEK IN ORDER TO 
LET THE F.B.I. 
TO DO AN INVESTIGATION LIMITED 
IN TIME AND SCOPE TO THE 
CURRENT ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE 
THERE AND LIMIT IN TIME TO NO 
MORE THAN ONE WEEK. 
AND I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE 
BILL TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT 
UNDERSTANDING. 
AND I'VE SPOKEN TO A FEW OTHER 
MEMBERS WHO -- ON MY SIDE OF 
THE AISLE WHO MAY BE SUPPORTIVE 
AS WELL. 
BUT THAT'S MY POSITION. 
I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO DO 
WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WE DO ALL DUE DILIGENCE WITH A 
NOMINATION THIS IMPORTANT. 
AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS 
COMMITTEE HAS ACTED PROPERLY 
AND THE CHAIRMAN HAS BENT OVER 
BACKWARDS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS 
FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND TO 
DELAY THIS VOTE IN THIS 
COMMITTEE FOR A WEEK SO THAT 
JUDGE -- OR THAT MS. FORD, DR. 
FORD COULD BE HEARD, AND SHE 
WAS YESTERDAY. 
SO THAT'S -- WITH THAT 
AGREEMENT, I WILL VOTE TO 
ADVANCE THE BILL TO THE FLOOR. 
>> CALL ROLL. 
>> WAIT JUST ONE SECOND, COULD 
DIANNE SPEAK? 
>> WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON? 
>> WE ARE VOTING ON THE MOTION 
TO REPORT THE NOMINATION TO THE 
FLOOR. 
CALL THE ROLL. 
>> MR. GRAHAM -- 
>> THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING 
OF WHAT MR. CHAIRMAN LET THE 
SENATOR EXPLAIN IT. 
>> MY UNDERSTANDING, AND IF THE 
DEMOCRATS COULD SPEAK TO IT, IF 
CHRIS OR YOU AS WE TALKED ABOUT 
BEFORE THAT THE DEMOCRATS WOULD 
ACCEPT AND ENDORSE A ONE-WEEK 
F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION LIMITED IN TIME 
AND SCOPE. 
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 
>> SINCE YOU'RE THE DECIDING 
VOTE HERE, WE'LL VOTE AND THEN 
IF THERE'S ANY SORT OF 
DISCUSSION WE'LL GO DO THAT 
AFTER THE VOTE. 
CALL THE ROLL. 
>> MR. GRAHAM. 
>> I. 
>> MR. CORNYN. 
>> I. 
>> MR. LEE. 
>> I. 
>> MR. CRUZ. 
>> I. 
>> MR. FLAKE. 
>> I. 
I. 
>> MR. TILLIS. 
>> I. 
>> MS. FEINSTEIN. 
>> ON THE NOMINEE, NO. 
>> MR. LEAHY. 
>> ON THE NOMINEE, NO. 
>> MR. BUR DURBIN. 
NO 
>> MR. WHITEHOUSE. 
>> NO. 
>> MS. KLOBUCHAR. 
NO. 
>> MR. HIRONO, NO. 
>> MR. HOOKER. 
NO 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> I. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN THE VOTES ARE 
11YAYS, 10NAYS. 
>> THE NOMINEE WILL BE REPORTED 
TO THE FLOOR. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MAY I BE 
RECOGNIZED? 
>> YES. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I JUST WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND 
AND COLLEAGUE SENATOR FLAKE AND 
THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE 
TIME TODAY TO HAVE A 
CONVERSATION. 
A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE 
ASKED FOR A ONE-WEEK DELAY IN 
ORDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN 
F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION OF WHAT 
ALLEGATIONS ARE CURRENTLY 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. 
I RESPECT SENATOR FLAKE'S VIEW 
THAT IN HIS OPINION IT WAS BEST 
TO RESPECT YOUR HAVING GIVEN 
DR. FORD THE TIME TO BE HEARD 
YESTERDAY AND ADVANCE THE 
NOMINEE TO THE FLOOR, BUT IT IS 
MY HOPE THAT WE COULD WORK 
TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS 
TO DILIGENTLY PURSUE AN F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION WITHIN THE NEXT 
WEEK, NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
DELAY, BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
INVESTIGATING FURTHER EITHER 
ALLEGATIONS MADE BY DR. FORD OR 
OTHERS WITH A GOAL TOWARDS 
DEMONSTRATING A BIPARTISAN 
COMMITMENT TO DILIGENTLY 
INVESTIGATING THESE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU, SENATOR FLAKE. 
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I WOULD SUPPORT THAT MOTION. 
I THINK WE DO NEED THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I SORT OF 
MISUNDERSTOOD SENATOR FLAKE 
WHAT YOU WERE DOING. 
I THOUGHT IT INCLUDED A ONE-
WEEK INVESTIGATION. 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE 
MOTION FOR THAT INVESTIGATION. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
SENATOR. TAKE TURNS HERE. -
>> I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE, BUT 
WE'RE NOT THE MAJORITY LEADER. 
SENATOR FLAKE HAS MADE CLEAR 
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO BE 
COMFORTABLE ON A FINAL PASSAGE 
VOTE. 
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE 
SAY HERE. 
THIS WILL BE UP TO SENATOR 
SCHUMER AND SENATOR McCONNELL. 
>> IT IS COMPLETELY UP TO THEM. 
>> YEAH. 
AND I THINK HE'S MADE HIMSELF 
VERY CLEAR -- 
>> SENATOR. 
LET'S MOVE. 
SENATOR LEAHY. 
SENATOR LEAHY. 
>> WELL, CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO 
MAKE SURE BECAUSE THIS IS 
SOMEWHAT UNPRECEDENTED. 
I DO AGREE WITH THE SENATOR 
FROM ARIZONA THAT WE SHOULD 
HAVE THIS FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION. 
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT 
DURING THE WEEK THAT THAT IS 
TAKING PLACE, THERE WILL BE NO 
ACTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE ON THIS 
NOMINATION, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> THAT CANNOT -- I CANNOT SAY 
THAT -- 
>> LET ME SAY AGAIN, I'M NOT 
MAKING -- I CAN'T MAKE THAT 
COMMITMENT FOR THE LEADERSHIP. 
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WOULD BE 
ONLY COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD 
ON THE FLOOR -- I'LL MOVE IT 
OUT OF COMMITTEE, BUT I WILL 
ONLY BE COMFORTABLE MOVING ON 
THE FLOOR UNTIL THE F.B.I. 
HAS DONE MORE INVESTIGATION 
THAN THEY HAVE ALREADY. 
IT MAY NOT TAKE THEM A WEEK. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THESE 
WITNESSES MAY NOT WANT TO 
DISCUSS ANYTHING FURTHER, BUT I 
THINK WE OWE THEM DUE 
DILIGENCE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> JUST A MINUTE. 
ALL I HAVE SAID TO SENATOR 
FLAKE IS THAT I WOULD ADVOCATE 
FOR THE POSITION HE TOOK, BUT I 
DON'T CONTROL THAT. 
SENATOR. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> YES. 
SENATOR KLOBUCHAR. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE 
OTHER SENATORS AS WELL WHO MAY 
BE INTERESTED IN THIS 
NEGOTIATION ON THE REPUBLICAN 
SIDE AND THERE'S NOT REALLY A 
SET AGREEMENT HERE. 
ALL OF US HAD ALREADY SAID WE 
WERE VOTING NO. 
IT IS SIMPLY SENATOR FLAKE 
WORKING WITH ALL OF US TO SAY 
FOR THE GOOD OF THE SENATE AND 
THE GOOD OF THE COURT, THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE 
THE FACTS FOLLOWED UP ON. 
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS 
WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT. 
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. 
THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT -- AND, BY 
THE WAY, IF SENATOR McCONNELL 
WANTS TO GO FORWARD IN LIGHT OF 
THAT AND WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL 
SENATORS THAT HAVEN'T SAID HOW 
THEY'RE VOTING ON THIS NOMINEE, 
I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS VERY 
IMPORTANT WHAT JUST HAPPENED 
RIGHT NOW. 
SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE AN 
AGREEMENT. 
IT IS ONE SENATOR WHO'S 
STANDING UP. 
>> SENATOR CORNYN. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I JUST WANT TO 
EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO 
SENATOR FLAKE FOR ALLOWING THIS 
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. 
THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCE OF 
OPINION AMONG US AS TO WHAT 
EXACTLY THE F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION WOULD CONSIST OF. 
SOME OF US THINK IT HAS BEEN 
CONCLUDED AND SUPPLEMENTED BY 
THIS COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION, 
OTHERS DISAGREE WITH THAT. 
BUT I RESPECT THE FACT THAT NOT 
ONLY SENATOR FLAKE ADVOCATED TO 
GIVE DR. FORD A CHANCE TO 
APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE 
COMMITTEE WHICH WAS THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO, BUT ALSO THAT HE'S 
ALLOWED THIS PROCESS TO MOVE 
FORWARD SUBJECT TO FURTHER 
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT ABOUT 
WHAT THE F.B.I. 
MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COME 
UP WITH, BUT CERTAINLY HE 
REMAINS WITH HIS RIGHT TO CAST 
HIS VOTE AND MAINTAIN 
SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE THAT WAY. 
BUT I APPRECIATE HIS SUPPORT 
FOR A FULL AND FAIR HEARING FOR 
DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS 
WELL AS HIS WILLINGNESS TO 
ALLOW THIS TO GO FORWARD 
SUBJECT TO HIS REQUEST. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> I THINK I OUGHT TO CALL ON 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
>> IF I THROUGH THE CHAIR COULD 
ASK A QUESTION OF SENATOR 
FLAKE, DOES YOUR AMENDMENT 
INCLUDE CONTINUING THE 
INVESTIGATION DURING THIS 
PERIOD OF TIME? 
>> IF I CAN RESPOND, THERE IS 
NO AMENDMENT. 
I'M SIMPLY STATING THE 
DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD BETWEEN 
US ALL IS THAT I WOULD HOPE AND 
I THINK WE HAD SOME AGREEMENT 
BEFORE THAT THE DEMOCRATS WHO 
HAVE BEEN I THINK JUSTIFIABLY 
UNCOMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD 
COULD PUBLICLY IN AN EFFORT TO 
BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER SAY 
THAT WE WOULD FEEL BETTER -- 
I'M NOT EXPECTING AND TO VOTE 
YES, BUT NOT TO COMPLAIN THAT 
AN F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION HAS NOT OCCURRED, 
AND THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO 
DO. 
THIS COUNTRY IS BEING RIPPED 
APART HERE, AND WE'VE GOT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO DUE 
DILIGENCE. 
I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE 
A GOOD JOB, BUT I DO THINK THAT 
WE CAN HAVE A SHORT PAUSE AND 
MAKE SURE THAT THE F.B.I. 
CAN INVESTIGATE. 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME 
OF US WOULD HAVE TO AND I'M 
PREPARED TO DO IT, MAKE A 
REQUEST TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO 
ASK THE F.B.I. 
TO DO THAT INVESTIGATION. 
IT WOULD BE SHORT AND LIMITED 
IN SCOPE TO THE CURRENT 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 
MADE. 
>> BECAUSE THERE'S A TWO-HOUR 
RULING WE'RE ADJOURNED.
>>
TWO HOUR RULE, WE ARE ADJOURNED.
>> WHAT? 
>> SURROUNDING MORE HIGH DRAMA 
ON CAPITOL HILL THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS VOTED 
TO SEND BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION TO THE FULL SENATE 
FOR A VOTE EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
THAT WAS AN 11-10 VOTE BUT AS 
PART OF THE PROCESS, SENATOR 
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA SAID THAT 
-- HE VOTED YES TO MOVE THE 
PROCESS FORWARD AND HE SAID HE 
WILL NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BEING CONFIRMED NEXT 
WEEK ON THE FULL FLOOR UNLESS 
HE SEES AN FBI INVESTIGATION OF 
UP TO ONE WEEK INTO THE 
ALLEGATIONS OF CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD A LOT TOOK PLACE RIGHT NOW 
AS THESE NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE 
AND IT O'KEEFE IS STANDING BY.  
>> Reporter:  THIS IS AN 
INCREDIBLE DEVELOPMENT. 
IT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SENATE 
IS DESIGNED FOR. 
ESSENTIALLY THE LEVERAGE AND 
ALL OF THE ATTENTION SHIFTS 
FROM THE COMMITTEE ROOM TO THE 
FULL SENATE, WHERE IT IS AN 
ISSUE FOR ALL 100 SENATORS AND 
NOT JUST THE 21 ON THE 
COMMITTEE. 
WHAT JEFF FLAKE DID THERE IS 
SAY, I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR 
THE MOTIONS TO PROCEED TO A 
FULL DEBATE ON THE SENATE ON 
THIS NOMINATION UNLESS AND UNTIL
THERE IS A WEEKLONG FBI 
INVESTIGATION, AND HE DID THAT, 
MOST LIKELY KNOWING THAT HE IS 
NOT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN THAT 
FEELS THAT WAY. 
REMEMBER THAT AT THIS HOUR, WE 
ARE WAITING TO SEE YOUR -- TO 
HEAR WHAT SUSAN COLLINS OF 
MAINE AND LISA MURKOWSKI OF 
ALASKA WOULD DO IN THIS 
SITUATION. 
WE KNOW THAT HE HAS CONSULTED 
WITH THEM ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT 
VOTE FOR WE HAVE 51 
REPUBLICANS, 49 MEMBERS OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. 
IF MORE THAN ONE VOTES NO ON 
ANY VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE 
SENATE RIGHT NOW, IT IS DEAD IN 
THE WATER. 
SO JEFF FLAKE IS SAYING, I AND 
PRESUMABLY A HANDFUL OF OTHER 
REPUBLICANS DO NOT WANT TO 
PROCEED ULESS WE KNOW THAT 
THERE IS SOME KIND OF FBI 
INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY. 
>> RIGHT NOW, THE UP IN THE AIR 
VOTES -- CORRECT ME IF I AM 
WRONG. 
JEFF FLAKE, SUSAN COLLINS, LISA 
MURKOWSKI, AND THE DEMOCRATS 
JOE MANSION AND ALSO HEIDI 
HEITKAMP. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> Reporter: CORRECT.  
IT HAS GONE BACK TO FIVE. 
THOSE FIVE HAVE NOT PUBLICLY 
ANNOUNCED WHAT THEY WOULD DO 
BEYOND THAT JEFF FLAKE AND WE 
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN 
CONSULTATION. 
SUSAN COLLINS REMAINS IN THE 
CAPITAL, IN HER PRIVATE OFFICE, 
CONSULTING WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH 
PARTIES. 
JOE MANSION IS BACK IN WEST 
VIRGINIA TODAY, CAMPAIGNING, 
BUT HE HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH 
HIS COLLEAGUES AND WHAT WE WILL 
THAT, YES, THERE IS A CONSENSUS 
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME 
KIND OF FBI INVESTIGATION 
BEFORE THERE IS A FINAL VOTE. 
REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THE 
STICKING POINT. 
IT IS THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HAS 
TO REQUEST THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION SO THIS GETS 
THROWN TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT WILL DECIDE. 
DO WE HAVE SOME KIND OF 
INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO SAVE 
THE NOMINATION? 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
NANCY COURTESANS AND CAPITOL 
HILL DOING GREAT REPORTING. 
WE WILL CHECK IN WITH YOU 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. 
THERE IS NANCY. 
REALLY QUICKLY BEFORE WE LEAVE, 
CAN YOU GIVE US A QUICK 
DEBRIEFING ON WHAT WE JUST SAW 
AND WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT? 
>> Reporter:  THIS SHOWS HOW 
MUCH POWER ONE SENATOR HAS WHEN 
THE SENATE IS DIVIDED 51-49. 
REPUBLICANS CAN ONLY AFFORD TO 
LOSE ONE SENATOR AND SO JEFF 
FLAKE KNOWS THAT HE HAS GOT A 
LOT OF LEVERAGE. 
ALL EYES ARE ON THE SENATE 
MAJORITY LEADER, MITCH 
McCONNELL. 
WILL HE AGREE TO HOLD THAT VOTE 
FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK? 
WILL THE WHITE HOUSE AGREED TO 
ENABLE THE FBI TO DO THIS 
INVESTIGATION? 
JEFF FLAKE HAS BEEN AGONIZING 
OVER THIS FOR THE PAST DAY AND 
HE WAS IN THE HEARING, WALKED 
OUT SAYING THAT HE HAD A LOT OF 
DOUBTS. 
>> NANCY CORTEZ, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR IT O'KEEFE. 
WE WILL BE CHECKING IN LATER 
TONIGHT  MORE ABOUT ALL OF THIS 
ON YOUR LOCAL NEWS ON THIS 
STATION ON THE 24 HOUR 
STREAMING SERVICE, CBSN AND 
TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS.
TO RECAP, THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE HAS VOTED TO SEND THE 
FULL VOTE FOR BRETT KAVANAUG 
TO THE FLOOR NEXT WEEK, BUT 
THERE ARE CAVEATS AND THERE ARE 
NEGOTIATIONS THAT CONTINUE 
FOLLOWING WHAT JEFF FLAKE 
JUSTIN JEFF GLOR, CBS NEWS, NEW 
YORK. 
WE WILL SEE YOU LATER. 
>>> FOUR NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, 
GO TO CBS NEWS.COM. 
>> WE ARE CONTINUING TO FOLLOW 
THE DRAMATIC REVERSAL BY JEFF 
FLAKE OF ARIZONA. 
THIS MORNING HE SAID THAT HE 
WOULD VOTE YES ON BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND MOMENTS AGO HE 
ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS HOLDING 
THAT VOTE OF YES, PENDING A FULL
FBI INVESTIGATION THAT HE IS 
REQUESTING FOR A WEEK. 
I WANT TO BRING IN THE PANEL TO 
DISCUSS HIS. 
ONE OF THE BIG FOCUSES THAT IT 
O'KEEFE WAS MENTIONING IS THAT 
THE WHITE HOUSE NEEDS TO CALL 
FOR THE INVESTIGATION. 
YOU DID SOME REPORTING. 
>>> REMEMBER THAT LAST WEEK 
WHEN CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S 
LAWYERS AND DEMOCRATS CALLED 
FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION  
BEFORE ALL OF THIS, REPUBLICAN 
SAID NO. 
FIRST OF ALL, -- STOMACH I 
APOLOGIZE. 
>> THIS ADDITIONAL 
INVESTIGATION, BEFORE I VOTE 
FOR THIS NOMINEE. 
IF HE IS JOINED BY ONE OR TWO 
OTHER REPUBLICANS IN THAT 
REQUEST, THEN THEY WOULD NOT 
HAVE THE VOTES UNLESS THE 
INVESTIGATION OCCURRED. 
I DON'T NOW. 
YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK THEM. 
IT IS ONE WEEK IS WHAT SENATOR 
JEFF FLAKE WAS INTERESTED IN 
AND YOU CAN DO A LOT IF YOU 
HAVE THE WHOLE FBI LOOKING AT 
THINGS IN ONE WEEK. 
>> DID SENATOR FLAKE BRING THE 
IDEA TO THE DEMOCRATS? 
>> YOU SHOULD TALK TO SENATOR 
FLAKE ABOUT THAT BUT YOU HAVE 
SEEN HIM TO BE INDEPENDENT IN 
TERMS OF THE DECISIONS HE MAKES 
AND WHAT HE SAYS AND HE FELT 
THAT HE HAD A VERY IMPORTANT 
ROLE TO PLAY AS A MEMBER OF THE 
COMMITTEE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> Reporter: IS HE STILL IN 
THERE? 
NO I BELIEVE HE IS STILL IN 
THERE A NUMBER OF US  HAD 
SUGGESTED THE WEEK. 
I SUGGESTED IT TODAY DID WE 
ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY? 
NO. 
WE ARE IN A BETTER PLACE THAN 
WE WERE AT 8 AM THIS MORNING. 
>>> WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THIS 
SWITCHED? 
BUT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD 
TALK TO HIM. 
>> THAT WAS AMY KLOBUCHAR WAVY 
JUDGMENT WEIGHING IN. 
WE ARE EXPECTING -- LET'S 
LISTEN TO THIS. 
THIS IS LINDSEY GRAHAM. 
>> I HOPE SOME DEMOCRATS WILL 
SAY, IF WE DO WHAT JEFF FLAKE 
SAID, THAT WOULD END THE 
PROCESS DISPUTE, AT LEAST A FEW 
OF THEM I DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO 
VOTE FOR THE GUY BUT IF WE 
ASKED THE FBI TO LOOK AT WHAT 
IS IN FRONT OF US, NO LONGER 
THAN A WEEK, THEN THEY WOULD 
SAY THAT WOULD BE A BETTER 
PROCESS. 
THAT WOULD BE PROGRESS AND JEFF 
FLAKE IS TRYING HIS BEST TO 
BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND 
VOTE THE BEST WAY HE KNOWS HOW. 
I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT IS THE 
AGREEMENT THAT I WILL GET BACK 
WITH YOU. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM NOW. 
>> Reporter: IS IT A GOOD IDEA 
FIANNA DOES? 
>> THE LAST TIME I LOOKED, YOU 
NEED 50 VOTES . 
>>>  
>> ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT RIGHT 
NOW, WHAT JEFF FLAKE IS SAYING 
MAKES SENSE TO ME. 
I AM NOT SPEAKING FOR MITCH. 
I'M GOING TO TALK WITH JEFF 
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO EXPLAIN 
THIS TO DONALD TRUMP I GUESS 
THAT WILL BE MY JOB. 
>> Reporter: ARE YOU GOING TO 
BACK THIS MOVE? 
>> IF I AM NOTHING, I AM 
PRACTICAL. 
OKAY?  
>> Reporter: THIS IS 
ASTOUNDING.  
>> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM 
WEIGHING IN, A SLIGHTLY 
LIGHTHEARTED MOMENT, AND SAYING 
THAT IF ANYTHING I AM A 
REALIST. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS CHIMED IN AND 
WE ARE EXPECTING THAT VIDEO. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT HE 
THOUGHT, QUOTE, HE HAS NOT 
THOUGHT AND I'M QUOTING, EVEN A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT A POSSIBLE 
REPLACEMENT FOR BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
YOU NEED THE WHITE HOUSE TO 
WEIGH IN AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE 
HEARD LINDSEY GRAHAM, A 
DIFFERENT TONE FROM YESTERDAY. 
>> REPULICANS ARE SIGNALING, 
FINE, WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT 
TAKES TO GET THE NOMINATION 
THROUGH. 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DURING ÃºT 
JEFF FLAKE MUST HAVE SOME 
CONSENSUS FROM AMY MURKOWSKI -- 
FROM JOE MANSION, THAT THEY 
WILL NOT HAVE THE VOTES UNLESS 
THE INVESTIGATION GOES FORWARD. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO AUTHORIZE 
THE FBI INVESTIGATION AND THE 
ARGUMENT FROM REPUBLICANS HAS 
BEEN THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
UNDERWENT A SIX FBI 
INVESTIGATIONS AND NOTHING CAME 
UP, THAT THEY PUT THE NEW 
ALLEGATION FROM FORD INTO HIS 
FILE AND SEND IT BACK TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE THERE WAS 
NO EVIDENCE OF A FEDERAL CRIME, 
THAT IT WAS NOT THE FBI'S ROLE. 
THERE IS THE CONCERN THAT 
DEMOCRATS -- SPLIT I APOLOGIZE 
TO INTERRUPT. 
WE WANT TO LISTEN TO LINDSEY 
GRAHAM. 
>> SOME OF THE GAMES BEING 
PLAYED. 
HE BELIEVES THAT IF THE FBI HAD 
A FEW MORE DAYS, SOME DEMOCRATS 
HAVE TOLD HIM THAT WOULD 
ALLEVIATE THE PROCESS CONCERNS, 
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT GOING 
TO VOTE FOR HIM. 
I THINK THAT WHAT HE IS TRYING 
TO DO IS END THIS THE BEST THAT 
HE POSSIBLY CAN, TO ACCOMMODATE 
SOME PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
AND TO BRING THE COMMITTEE 
TOGETHER IF POSSIBLE. 
SO THIS IS DEMOCRACY. 
AM I MAD AT JEFF PLAY? 
AM I IN A DIFFERENT PLACE? 
YES. 
TURN WHAT IF THE FBI IS NOT 
DONE WITH THE BACKGROUND CHECK? 
>> I THINK THAT WHAT JEFF FLAKE 
IS A, 130 CAN HAVE THE FBI, 
CIA, AND FOREIGN LEGION AND 
THEY WILL NOT TELL YOU ANYTHING 
MORE THAN YOU KNOW NOW. 
THAT IS MY VIEW BUT WE WILL SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS. 
HE SAID THAT A WEEK IS ENOUGH 
FOR HIM OR MAYBE LESS. 
WE ARE NOT PLAYING THIS GAME OF 
OPENING THIS UP AND IT GOES ON 
FOREVER. 
WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT I WOULD 
FEEL BETTER IF THEY HAD A WEEK 
TO LOOK AT WHAT IS IN FRONT OF 
US, NO MORE. 
SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID, OKAY 
WITH THAT. 
I WOULD LIKE THEM TO COME 
FORWARD. 
I'M GOING TO TALK TO MITCH 
McCONNELL AND JEFF AND 
EVENTUALLY ENGAGE WITH THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
AGAIN, I DO NOT THINK THAT WE 
NEED THIS. 
I AM LONG SINCE READY TO VOTE I 
THINK HE HAS BEEN VERY POORLY 
TREATED, JUDGE KAVANAUGH., DO 
YOU THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO 
SAVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION? 
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. 
I THINK THAT JEFF FLAKE FEELS 
GOOD ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
PROCESS IS FAIR BUT YOU NEED TO 
ASK YOU BUT I'VE NEVER FELT 
BETTER ABOUT HIM BEING ON THE 
BENCH THAN I DO RIGHT NOW. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
WE HAVE SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, A 
DEMOCRAT FROM CONNECTICUT. 
>> LET'S BE REAL AND PENETRATING
SO THAT THE TRUTH AND FACTS AND 
EVIDENCE ARE ALL UNCOVERED. 
THIS FBI INVESTIGATION CANNOT 
BE A SHOW OR A CHARADE. 
IT MUST BE REAL AND IT MUST GO 
TO THE WITNESSES WHO ARE LIKELY 
TO PRODUCE FACTS AND EVIDENCE. 
>> Reporter: IS IT YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING THAT JEFF FLAKE 
HAD THE ASSURANCES OF OTHER 
SENATORS IN THE PARTY BEFORE 
YOU MADE THIS DECISION? 
>> SENATOR FLAKE TALKED TO A 
NUMBER OF SENATORS IN HIS OWN 
PARTY AS WELL AS  ON OUR SIDE, 
AND I APPRECIATE THAT HE WAS 
SEEKING COMMON GROUND. 
>> Reporter: WHAT CAN HE AND 
HIS COLLEAGUE TO IF LEADERSHIP 
DECIDES TO GO AHEAD WITH THE 
VOTE ANYWAY? 
>> OBVIOUSLY, SENATOR FLAKE 
COULD VOTE AGAINST THE 
NOMINATION.  
>> Reporter:  DID HE SAY HE 
WOULD DO THAT? 
>> NO. 
HE HAS NOT INDICATED TO ME WHAT 
HE WOULD DO BUT THE INCENTIVE 
FOR THE LEADERSHIP FOLLOWING 
HIS WISHES AS TO THE DELAY AS 
THEY NEED HIS VOTE. 
ALONG WITH ALL OF THE OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE MAJORITY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> Reporter: WHO INITIATED 
THESE CONVERSATIONS TODAY? 
WAS IT HIM OR ANOTHER DEMOCRAT? 
>> I CANNOT COMMENT.  
>> WE JUST HEARD SENATOR 
BLUMENTHAL THERE. 
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS 
TOSSED BY A CAPITOL HILL 
REPORTER WAS, DO YOU KNOW IF 
SENATOR FLAKE HAD SPOKEN TO 
OTHER REPUBLICAN SENATORS, 
WHICH IS KEY? 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW 
POWERFUL SENATOR McCONNELL IS 
BEEN HAVING JEFF FLAKE WITH 
OTHER REPUBLICANS TAG TEAMING 
Ãº 
>>> THAT IS RIGHT REPUBLICANS 
COULD LOSE A VOTE AND MIKE 
PENCE COULD BE THE TIEBREAKER 
BUT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT 
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY WITH 
JEFF FLAKE MEETING WITH A 
COUPLE OF SENATORS THAT WERE 
KIND OF ON THE FENCE, IT SEEMS 
TO US THAT, FOR WHAT WE ARE 
SEEING, THAT JEFF FLAKE DOES 
HAVE SOME SICK -- SOME CONSENSUS
AND OTHERWISE THERE WOULD NOT 
BE INCENTIVE FOR MITCH 
McCONNELL TO NOT BRING THIS TO 
THE FLOOR. 
>>> WE ARE HEARING FROM THE 
PRESIDENT AND HE CHIMED IN ON 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
IN MY UNDERSTANDING, NOT 
CONFIRMED FULLY, BUT THIS IS 
BEFORE THE JEFF FLAKE SITUATION 
UNFOLDED HE SAID THAT HE IS 
DEFERRING TO THE GOP'S 
SENATORS. 
HE SPOKE FONDLY ABOUT FORD 
TESTIMONY AND WHATEVER THEY 
THINK IS NECESSARY, WITHOUT A 
DELIBERATE INTERESTING THAT HE 
SAID WITHOUT A DELAY. 
>> ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND 
ABOUT AN FBI INVESTIGATION IS 
THAT IT WOULD NOT TAKE THAT 
LONG. 
>> HERE IS THE PRESIDENT. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT, ANY 
COMMENT ON THE REQUEST FOR THE 
DELAY FROM SENATOR FLAKE, A ONE 
WEEK DELAY FOR THE FBI? 
I'M GOING TO LET THE SENATE 
HANDLE THAT. 
THEY WILL MAKE THEIR DECISIONS 
AND DO A GOOD JOB.  
VERY PROFESSIONAL. 
I AM JUST HEARING A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN 
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF CHILLY 
AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
IMPORTANT SUBJECTS.  
I AM SURE THAT IT WILL ALL BE 
VERY GOOD. 
I GUESS THE BOAT WAS POSITIVE 
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A DELAY. 
I WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT IT AS 
THE DAY GOES ON. 
I JUST HEARD ABOUT IT BECAUSE 
WE WERE TOGETHER. 
>> Reporter: WHAT DID YOU THINK 
ABOUT  THE DOCTOR FOR 
TESTIMONY? 
>> I THOUGHT THAT HER TESTIMONY 
WAS VERY COMPELLING AND SHE 
LOOKS LIKE A VERY FINE WOMAN TO 
ME. 
A VERY FINE WOMAN. 
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, LIKEWISE,
WAS REALLY SOMETHING THAT I 
HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. 
IT WAS INCREDIBLE. 
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT, I 
THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
BUT CERTAINLY SHE WAS A VERY 
CREDIBLE WITNESS. 
SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY 
RESPECTS, AND I THINK THAT -- I 
DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO 
CONTINUE ONWARD OR WE ARE GOING 
TO GET A VOTE OF BUT, AGAIN, I 
AM HERE. 
I'M NOT OUT THERE WATCHING 
BECAUSE I CANNOT BE. 
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT, ALTHOUGH 
IT MAY BE BE WILL WATCH 
TOGETHER. 
OKAY? 
WE WILL WATCH TOGETHER I THINK 
THAT IT WILL WORK OUT VERY WELL 
FOR THE COUNTRY. 
I JUST WANTED TO WORK OUT WELL 
FOR THE COUNTRY. 
IF THAT HAPPENS, I AM HAPPY. 
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU THOUGHT 
ABOUT A REPLACEMENT FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH? 
>> NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  
I HAVE NO MESSAGE. 
IT HAS TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IS 
RIGHT. 
THERE IS NO MESSAGE WHATSOEVER. 
THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY THINK 
IS RIGHT. 
THEY HAVE TO -- I AM SURE THAT 
IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 
I'M GOING TO RELY ON ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE, INCLUDING SENATOR 
GRASSLEY, WHO IS DOING A VERY 
GOOD JOB. 
THAT WOULD BE A DECISION THAT 
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE AND I 
SUSPECT THEY WILL BE MAKING 
SOME DECISIONS SOON, WEATHER TO 
TAKE A BOAT OR DO WHATEVER THEY 
WANT TO DO. 
I WILL BE TOTALLY RELIANT ON 
WHAT SENATOR GRASSLEY AND THE 
GROUP DECIDES TO DO.  
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
VENEZUELA. 
I WAS WAITING FOR THE QUESTION. 
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING VENEZUELA 
A MAGNET MANY OTHER THINGS. 
A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS 
GOING ON IN THAT PART OF THE 
WORLD. 
CHILE IS REALLY SOMETHING 
SPECIAL IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT 
THEY HAVE DONE, HOW FAR THEY 
HAVE COME. 
YOU LOOK AT HOW WELL RUN THE 
COUNTRY IS. 
I JUST WANT TO SAY IT IS AN 
HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. 
A GREAT HONOR. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
WHATEVER THEY THINK IS 
NECESSARY IS OKAY WITH ME. 
>> IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT -- 
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS MADE 
AWARE OF THE DECISION BY JEFF 
FLAKE AND IN THIS PRESS AVAIL 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS 
AWARE THAT SENATOR FLAKE HAS 
REVERSED HIS VOTE AND PENDING 
AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 
WHEN ASKED WHAT MESSAGE HE HAS 
FOR SENATOR MURKOWSKI AND 
SENATOR COLLINS, HE SAID I HAVE 
NO MESSAGE BUT THEY HAVE TO DO 
WHAT IS RIGHT. 
CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG 
JOINS US RIGHT NOW. 
I AM JUST CURIOUS WHAT A 
MORNING IT HAS BEEN FOR YOU AND 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN HEARING? 
IS THE MESSAGE FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE PRESS OFFICE VARIED OR 
BEEN CONSISTENT? 
>> Reporter: IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
POINT OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE 
PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS 
AWARE OF SOME SORT OF 
DEVELOPMENT  THAT INVOLVE JEFF 
FLAKE, I REALLY DO NOT THINK 
THAT HE KNOWS YET EXACTLY WHAT 
THAT MEANS AND HOW THIS COULD 
PLAY OUT AND A DECISION THAT HE 
HAS TO MAKE IN THE UPCOMING 
DAYS. 
HE CONTINUED TO DEFER TO GOP'S 
SENATORS, SAYING THAT HE TRUSTS 
THEM. 
HE THINKS THAT THEY ARE GOING 
TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 
THE FACT IS THAT HE IS THE ONE 
THAT WILL HAVE TO DECIDE 
WHETHER TO ORDER THIS  
INVESTIGATION FROM THE FBI SO 
EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
THAT HE WILL RELY ON SENATOR 
GRASSLEY AND MITCH McCONNELL, 
THAT IS A CONVERSATION THAT 
THEY WILL ALL, I EXPECT, HAVE 
VERY SOON AND THEY WILL BE 
COMING TO HIM TO SAY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, LISTEN, I DO NOT THINK 
THAT WE HAVE THE VOTES ON THE 
FULL SENATE FLOOR NOW THAT JEFF 
FLAKE HAS COME OUT. 
I IMAGINE THAT SENATORS COLLINS 
AND MURKOWSKI ARE ALSO WITH HIM 
AND TO DEMAND THAT THIS 
INVESTIGATION BEFORE THEY MOVE 
FORWARD WITH A FULL VOTE. 
EVEN THOUGH, YOU ARE RIGHT AND 
THAT HE HAD KNOWLEDGED THAT 
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND IT 
MADE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE, I'M 
NOT QUITE SURE THAT HE HAS BEEN 
BRIEFED ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAS 
TRANSPIRED AND THAT JEFF FLAKE 
AND OTHERS COULD BE CALLING FOR 
THIS INVESTIGATION. 
IT IS HIS DECISION, EVEN THOUGH 
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT IT IS 
UP TO THE SENATORS. 
HE IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO CALL FOR THE BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION. 
BEFORE THIS DEVELOPMENT, THE 
WHITE HOUSE WAS CERTAINLY A 
VERY OPTIMISTIC. 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEY 
THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO 
MAKE IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE. 
THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT 
ULTIMATELY BRETT KAVANAUGH 
WOULD BE CONFIRMED BUT THIS 
DOES CHANGE THE GAME A LITTLE 
BIT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR 
ALL ALONG. 
THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE 
FACTS  AS ALL THE SENATORS MADE 
THE FINAL VOTE ON THE SENATE 
FLOOR ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE. 
WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL TRANSPIRE 
FROM THE FBI INVESTIGATION? 
IF THERE WILL BE ONE. 
BUT I IMAGINE IF IT IS MADE 
CLEAR BY JEFF FLAKE AND OTHER 
REPUBLICANS THAT THEY WILL NOT 
VOTE YES WITHOUT AN 
INVESTIGATION, THE PRESIDENT 
DOES NOT HAVE MUCH CHOICE BUT 
TO ORDER ONE, I THINK.  
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS SAYING, NOTHING YET SO 
FAR ABOUT THIS CIVIC 
DEVELOPMENT. 
BEFORE THIS, THE MOOD WAS 
CERTAINLY UPBEAT ABOUT THAT 
1:30 PM VOTE AND I IMAGINE, 
ONCE SOMEBODY EXPLAINS TO THE 
PRESIDENT THE SITUATION, WE CAN 
EXPECT MORE FROM HIM AND AS WE 
HEAR FROM SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM, HE APPARENTLY THINKS 
THAT HE IS THE ONE TO DO A. 
>> WEED THAT BUT THAT WAS A 
FUNNY MOMENT AND A GOOD POINT 
OF DISTINCTION THAT YOU MADE 
THAT THE PRESIDENT MIGHT NOT BE 
FULLY BRIEFED ON THIS SO WE 
SHOULD GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF 
ROOM TO SEE IF HE TIMES IN 
LATER. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
I WANT TO TURN TO IT O'KEEFE, 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ON 
CAPITOL HILL.  
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? 
>> Reporter:  AT THIS POINT, AS 
WEIJIA JIANG JUST SAID, THIS IS 
IN THE HANDS OF MITCH 
McCONNELL. 
IT HAS LEFT THE COMMITTEE ROOM. 
IT IS THE FULL SENATE'S PROBLEM 
SO IT HAS BECOME MITCH 
McCONNELL'S JOB, NUMBER ONE 
NOW, TO SAVE THIS NOMINATION AS 
HAS BEEN HIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGE 
AND HIS VOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 
BUT LAST WE CHECKED, AGAIN, IT 
IS THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HAS TO 
REQUEST AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 
WHAT MITCH McCONNELL HAS TO DO 
IS CHECK AND SAY WHO IS WITH 
JEFF FLAKE? 
HOW MANY REPUBLICANS AGREE THAT 
WE SHOULD WAIT? 
IF MORE THAN ONE OR MORE, SUSAN 
COLLINS, LISA MURKOWSKI, 
SOMEBODY ELSE SAYING THAT I AM 
WITH HIM, THEN MATHEMATICALLY 
HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO WAIT 
UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION HAPPENS 
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE NO 
REASON TO VOTE YES, MEANING ANY 
ATTEMPT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 
THE NOMINATION IN THE FULL 
SENATE STYLES. 
THAT IS THE CONVERSATION THAT 
AS LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID EARLIER 
HAS TO HAPPEN WITH THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
I HAVE TO SAY THE REALITY IS 
THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MATH 
UNLESS YOU LET THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION HAPPEN. 
HOW MANY DAYS IT LASTS, WHAT 
EXACTLY LOOKS INTO COME TO GET 
SUBPOENAED, ALL OF THAT IS A 
DETAIL THAT WE DO NOT HAVE AND 
WE DO NOT KNOW AND WE WILL HAVE 
TO WAIT AND SEE. 
AS YOU MENTIONED, WE DO NOT 
KNOW BUT THERE IS ALSO A THIRD 
ACCUSER, MICHAEL AVENATTI, 
REPRESENTING THE THIRD ACCUSER. 
IS THERE ANY APPETITE ON 
CAPITOL HILL TO TAKE THAT ON? 
DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WOULD 
JUST FOCUS ON DR. FORD? 
WE DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO 
UNDERSTAND. 
IT ONLY HAPPENED THE ONLY THING 
THAT WILL MATTER IS THE 
APPETITE AMONG REPUBLICANS. IF 
MORE THAN ONE REPUBLICAN AGREES 
WITH THE DEMOCRATS THAT THERE 
SHOULD BE SOMETHING, IT WILL 
HAPPEN UNDER THIS SCENARIO 
BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE 
MATH. 
AGAIN, YOU HAVE GOT TO START 
WITH WHAT DOES SUSAN COLLINS 
WANT TO DO? 
WHAT DOES LISA MURKOWSKI WANT 
TO DO? 
DO THEY AGREE WITH THE JEFF 
FLAKE AND THE DEMOCRATS THAT 
THERE SHOULD BE A DELAY? 
IF THEY SIGNAL AT THIS POINT 
SOME TIME THIS AFTERNOON 
TOMORROW THAT THEY AGREE, AND 
INSTALLS, THEY HAVE TO GET 
INVOLVED. 
THERE ARE DEMOCRATS THAT SAY 
THAT ALL OF THIS SHOULD BE 
INVESTIGATED. 
THE FBI SHOULD TAKE EVERYTHING 
AND FIGURE IT OUT. 
THAT WOULD LEAD TO SOMETHING 
THAT LASTS SEVERAL WEEKS WHICH 
WOULD CERTAINLY BE OKAY WITH 
MOST DEMOCRATS. 
IT IS NOT PROBABLY WHAT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN. 
THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE REST 
OF THE DAY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT 
TRANSPIRES, AND WE WILL WAIT 
AND SEE IF WE HEAR BY THE END 
OF THE DAY, THAT THE PRESIDENT 
TELLS CHRIS WRAY THAT THEY HAVE 
TO LOOK INTO THIS. 
>> DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF 
EXACTLY WHO SENATOR FLAKE HAS 
BEEN SPEAKING TO ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE? 
YOU MIGHT BE BEHIND HIM AND 
SUPPORTING THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> Reporter:  WHETHER THEY 
SUPPORT THE FBI INVESTIGATION 
IS STILL UNCLEAR BUT WE KNOW 
THAT LAST NIGHT  CONSULTATIONS 
BEGAN WITH LISA MURKOWSKI OF 
ALASKA, SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE 
AND JOE MANSION OF WEST 
VIRGINIA THAT IS THE ONE 
DEMOCRAT MUST HAVE EXPECTED 
WOULD ULTIMATELY SUPPORT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, GIVEN THE POLITICS 
OF HIS STATE AND THE FACT THAT 
HE IS UP FOR REELECTION THIS 
YEAR. 
THE PRESIDENT WON THERE BY MORE 
THAN 40 POINTS AND FACE A LOT 
OF PRESSURE TO VOTE YES BUT HAS 
NOT NECESSARILY TELEGRAPHED 
THAT HE IS GOING TO DO THAT HE 
HAS BEEN TALKING TO THOSE TWO 
REPUBLICANS AND CONVERSATIONS. 
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 
WERE MADE AWARE OF THIS. 
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS STARTED, 
SPARKED BY SOME COMMENTS THAT 
WERE MADE DURING THE COMMITTEE 
PROCEEDINGS BY CHRIS OF 
DELAWARE, A DEMOCRAT. 
HE AND JEFF FLAKE ARE GOOD 
FRIENDS, ON THE FOREIGN 
RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND THEY DO 
A LOT OF OVERSEAS TRAVEL AND 
THERE AROUND THE SAME AGE AND 
HAVE WORKED TO TRY TO BRIDGE 
THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE TWO 
PARTIES. 
HE SPOKE OF THE COMMITTEE. 
>> I APOLOGIZE. 
I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU. 
WE HAVE GOT HIM AND WE ARE 
GOING TO TAKE CHRIS OF 
DELAWARE. 
THEY SIMPLY PRESENT EVIDENCE. 
I THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER 
OF SENATORS THAT AFTER DR. 
FORD'S TESTIMONY BELIEVE THAT 
THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE 
THAT HAD NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY 
EXAMINED AND IT SHOULD BE DONE 
BUT WE AS SENATORS REACHED THE 
ULTIMATE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT 
VOTING FOR OR AGAINST JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH BUT I THINK THAT 
THERE WAS ENOUGH DOUBT RAISED 
YESTERDAY BY DR. FORD'S 
TESTIMONY THAT A NUMBER OF 
SENATORS FELT THAT A FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION WAS JUSTIFIED. 
>> DID SENATOR FLAKE A MENTION 
THE PROTESTERS THIS MORNING? 
DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE 
STATE OF MIND? 
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO 
TALK TO SENATOR FLAKE BUT LET 
ME SIMPLY SAY THIS BUT SENATOR 
FLAKE IS A GENUINE 
CONSERVATIVE. 
HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THE 
CONSCIENCE OF A CONSERVATIVE. 
WE DO NOT SHARE A LOT OF 
POLITICAL VIEWS BUT WE SHARE A 
DEEP CONCERN -- SORRY. SENATOR 
FLAKE AND I SHARE A DEEP 
CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH OF THIS 
INSTITUTION AND WHAT IT MEANS 
TO THE REST OF THIS WORLD AND 
IN THE COUNTRY IF WE ARE UNABLE 
TO CONDUCT OURSELVES 
RESPECTFULLY AND IN A WAY THAT 
HEARS EACH OTHER. 
IN THE BACK HALLWAY 
CONVERSATION, A NUMBER OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES ALSO HAD VERY SHARP 
CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER 
ABOUT SOME OF THE PARTISANSHIP 
AND SOME OF THE POSTURING, AND 
I FRANKLY THINK THAT WHAT 
SENATOR FLAKE IS TRYING TO DO 
IS BOTH ACHIEVE A BRIEF 
CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION OF 
ALLEGATIONS IN FRONT OF US AND 
SERVE AS A ROLE MODEL, AS HE 
HAS FOR ME TODAY, OF SOMEONE 
WHO IS REAL JUDGMENT WILLING TO 
TAKE A REAL POLITICAL RISK AND 
UPSET MANY IN HIS PARTY BY 
ASKING FOR A BREAK SO THAT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HEAR THAT 
WE ARE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER ON 
SOME THINGS AND THAT EVEN 
THOUGH HE AND I ARE FROM 
DIFFERENT PARTIES WITH 
DIFFERENT VALUES AND DIFFERENT 
BACKGROUNDS, WE RESPECT EACH 
OTHER AND WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. 
I HAVE TRAVELED TO COUNTRIES IN 
OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD WITH 
SENATOR FLAKE AND I KNOW HOW 
PASSIONATELY HE FEELS THAT OUR 
DIVISION RIGHT NOW TEACHES THE 
WRONG THING TO THE WORLD ABOUT 
OUR DEMOCRACY AND SUGGEST THAT 
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESPECT EACH 
OTHER OR WORK TOGETHER BUT IF 
YOU LOOK AT HIS VOTING RECORD 
IN THE LAST CONGRESS AND MINE, 
THEY ARE ALMOST AS FAR APART AS 
THEY CAN BE, YET WE RESPECT 
EACH OTHER AND CAN WORK 
TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT IS AN 
IMPORTANT LESSON. 
>> WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF THE 
IMPACT ON THE INSTITUTION AND 
COUNTRY WOULD BE IF HE DID NOT 
SUPPORT THIS? 
>> EXACTLY MY CONCERN AS 
EXPRESSED IN MY SPEECH TO THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
MY CONCERN WAS THAT BY BOWLING 
THROUGH THE NOMINATION WITHOUT 
ANY INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD 
SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL ABOUT 
PARTISANSHIP. 
HE WAS IN THE CHAMBER. 
TRAUMA CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE 
CONVERSATIONS? 
YOU SAID THAT THERE WERE SHARP 
CONVERSATIONS IN THE BACK. 
>> ANYONE THAT WATCHED THE 
JUDICIARY HEARING PROCESS 
YESTERDAY OR THE SPEECHES 
BEFORE TODAY KNOWS THAT THERE 
ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 
WHO ARE ACCUSING EACH OTHER OF 
ALL SORTS OF THINGS. 
MY ONE COMMENT WAS SENATOR 
BIDEN WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR AND 
SAID TO ME, YOU CAN ALWAYS 
QUESTION ANOTHER COLLEAGUE 
PRIORITIES AND YOU CAN QUESTION 
THEIR POLICIES BUT YOU SHOULD 
NOT QUESTION THEIR CHARACTER 
AND MOTIVES. 
THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH OF 
QUESTIOING EACH OTHER'S 
CHARACTERS AND MOTIVES AND 
THEIR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW 
WE ALL NEEDED TO LIGHTEN THE 
EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE GOING 
AFTER EACH OTHER PERSONALLY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 
SPANK SENATOR CHRIS WEIGHING IN 
AND I WANT TO BRING IN IT 
O'KEEFE. 
YOU COULD NOT HAVE PUT THAT 
SOUND ANY BETTER. 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JEFF 
FLAKE AND CHRIS AND I DO NOT 
KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE AND HEAR IT 
BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE WAS 
TEARING UP.  
>> YEAH. 
AS IF ON CUE, HE SHOWED UP AND 
WAS QUITE HELPFUL AND COLORING 
OUR UNDERSTANDING. 
HERE HE IS AGAIN. 
THIS IS FOR THE -- ALL RIGHT. 
>> SENATOR FLAKE AND I RESPECT 
EACH OTHER. 
WE HAVE TRAVELED THE WORLD 
TOGETHER AND LEGISLATED 
TOGETHER AND WE ARE CONCERNED 
THAT WHAT WE SAW IN YESTERDAY'S 
CONFIRMATION HEARING AND IN 
TODAY'S SPEECHES AND THE 
COMMITTEE IS TEARING THE 
COUNTRY APART HE FELT VERY 
STRONGLY THAT HE WANTED TO SEND 
A SIGNAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. 
WE CAN BREAK ON THE FINAL VOTE 
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO ASK THE 
FBI FOR A BRIEF FOCUSED IN 
SCOPE AND TIME INVESTIGATION 
AND I SAID I WOULD COME FORWARD 
AND SAY THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT 
AND SIGNIFICANT THING FOR HIM 
TO DO. 
I BELIEVE THAT HE HAS THE 
SUPPORT OF SEVERAL COLLEAGUES 
I HOLDING UP THE FINAL VOTE 
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS. 
I'M HOPEFUL THAT HE WILL HOLD 
FIRM UNTIL THAT HAPPENS. 
I AM GOING TO INSIST THAT THIS 
BE VIEWED AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
US TO WORK TOGETHER ACROSS THE 
AISLE. 
>> DID HE TELL YOU THAT HE HAS 
THE SUPPORT OF THE SENATORS 
COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI TO GET 
THE LEVERAGE? 
MAY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK HIM 
THAT BUT I KNOW THAT I HAVE 
ACTIVELY BEEN IN CONVERSATION 
WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES, DEMOCRAT 
AND REPUBLICAN, ABOUT THIS IDEA 
OF A ONE-WEEK PAUSE FOR A 
LIMITED IN SCOPE FBI 
INVESTIGATION AND I THINK THAT 
IS AN ADMIRABLE THING FOR A 
NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES TO BE 
ALSO ADVOCATED. 
>> Reporter: ANY CHANCE THAT 
YOU COULD VOTE YES  AFTER 
THIS.? 
WHAT I AM TENDING TO DO AND 
WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS 
CELEBRATING AND RECOGNIZING THE 
FACT THAT SENATOR FLAKE IS 
HOLDING THE DOOR OPEN FOR 
FURTHER INVESTIGATION IN THE 
INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
SEEING THAT THE JUDGE CAME -- 
DR. FORD CAME FORWARD WITH 
ALLEGATIONS AND THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY ARE 
TORMENTED BY THE MORE EXTREME 
ALLEGATIONS MADE AND THAT IN 
BOTH CASES A FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED. 
>> WE HAVE GOT TO GO. 
>> IN ESSENCE, THEY HAVE A 
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP. 
THERE WAS SOME REAL STRAIGHT 
TALK AMONGST EACH OTHER TODAY 
ABOUT WHAT POTENTIAL DAMAGE 
YESTERDAY COULD CAUSE TO THE 
INSTITUTION OF THE SENATE AND 
TO THE COUNTRY OVERALL. 
IT IS A HIGH WIRE ACT FOR 
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY'RE 
PUTTING A LOT OF FAITH IN JEFF 
FLAKE AND A SMALL HANDFUL OF 
REPUBLICANS TO GET THAT ONE 
WEEK, UP TO ONE WEEK EXTENSION, 
AND PROCEED WITH A VOTE. 
DO COOLER HEADS PREVAIL AFTER 
THAT? 
DOES THE SENATE ULTIMATELY TAKE 
THE TEACUP AND COOL IT OFF A 
LITTLE BIT? 
WE WILL SEE. 
CERTAINLY AN INTERESTING 
DEVELOPMENT AND DRIVEN BY GUYS 
LIKE CHRIS AND JEFF FLAKE THAT 
HAVE SPENT YEARS TRYING TO 
BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO 
PARTIES. 
>> JUST REALLY QUICKLY TO 
RECAP, DO WE -- IS THE NEXT 
THING THAT WE ARE WAITING ON TO 
HEAR FROM THE WHITE HOUSE? 
IS THE -- IT IS IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE COURT TO DETERMINE IF THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION HAPPENS? 
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON? 
>> Reporter: WE ARE WAITING FOR 
A SIGNAL FROM A  LEADER 
McCONNELL THAT HE IS ON BOARD 
WITH HIS AND HE UNDERSTANDS IT 
IS SOMETHING THAT HIS 
COLLEAGUES WANT AND THEN THEY 
WILL HAVE TO TALK TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE ABOUT POSSIBLY GETTING 
THIS DONE. 
WE WILL SEE. 
WE SHOULD EXPECTED TO BE FLUID 
ALL AFTERNOON LONG BUT 
DEFINITELY START WITH MITCH 
McCONNELL AND GO TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
AT SOME POINT LATER TODAY, WE 
WILL GET A BETTER SIGNAL. 
>> IT O'KEEFE. 
>>> I WAS JUST CHECKING.  
DEVELOPMENTS ARE SO FLUTED THAT 
THEY COULD BE ARRIVING IN THE 
INBOX. 
SO FAR THEY HAVE NOT. 
>> WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE 
CHECKING AND GRATEFUL FOR 
STREAMING BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE 
US WHEREVER YOU GO. 
IT O'KEEFE, WE WILL CHECK BACK 
WITH YOU . I WANT TO CHECK WITH 
THE PANEL. 
THE CBSN POLITICAL REPORTER, 
AND A COLUMNIST FOR THE HILL, 
LESLIE SANCHEZ, CBS NEWS 
CONTRIBUTOR AND REPUBLICAN 
STRATEGIST, A DEMOCRATIC 
STRATEGIST. 
YOU HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED 
MULTIPLE TIMES. 
WE HAVE GONE FROM THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION BUT I WANT TO GET 
YOUR THOUGHTS.  
>> Reporter:  THEY LAID OUT 
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET AN 
FBI INVESTIGATION. 
IT IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO 
NOTE THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATION 
WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE 
CONCLUSIVE. 
SO FAR AS THE DECISION, IT WILL 
STILL BE UP TO THESE LAWMAKERS. 
THE FBI WILL COMPLETE IT UNDER 
THE PROSPECT THAT MITCH 
McCONNELL SIGNS OFF AND DONALD 
TRUMP SIGNS OFF AND THE FBI 
TALKS TOO MANY OF THOSE MEMBERS 
THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS OR 
ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED, TALK TO 
THEM, DOES THE BACKGROUND 
CHECK, WHICH ACTUALLY COULD BE 
COMPLETED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. 
WITH ANITA HILL, IT WAS 
COMPLETED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS 
AND SANCTIONED BY PRESIDENT 
ÃºBU 
AGAIN, IT WILL PROVIDE SOME 
INFORMATION AND PRESENT IT BACK 
TO THE WHITE HOUSE INTO THE 
SENATE. 
AGAIN, THE FBI CANNOT DECIDE 
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, BUT THEY 
CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION 
AND AS LESLIE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
EARLIER, FROM A POLITICAL 
STANDPOINT, THIS SEEMS TO MAKE 
A LOT OF SENSE FOR REPUBLICANS 
ABOUT WANTING THIS -- NOT 
WANTING THIS TO HOVER OVER THE 
NOMINEE. 
BACK JUST TO RECAP, THE DRAMA 
STARTED JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, 
1:30 PM EASTERN, EXPECTING A 
VOTE IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 
IT WAS DELAYED AND DEMOCRATS 
DID NOT SHOW UP AND SENATOR 
JEFF FLAKE LATER ANNOUNCES THAT 
HE IS HOLDING HIS YES VOTE. 
HE ANNOUNCED EARLY IN THE 
MORNING THAT THERE WAS A YES 
VOTE AND HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE 
A LIMITED IN SCOPE ONE-WEEK 
SENATE AND FBI INVESTIGATION 
INTO THESE ALLEGATIONS. 
WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT 
THAT WOULD MEAN AND DOES HE 
HAVE THE SUPPORT? 
WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHETHER 
OR NOT -- HOW DO YOU THINK THAT 
MITCH McCONNELL IS GOING TO 
RESPOND?  
MIKE WELL, HE THOUGHT THAT THE 
SENATE WAS BORING. 
RIGHT? 
THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY TURN OF 
EVENTS TO HAVE JEFF FLAKE 
SWITCH HIS VOTE OR POSITION IN 
THIS MATTER AFTER EVERYBODY 
THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ESSENTIALLY 
BOWED TO PARTY LOYALTY EARLIER 
ON IN THE DAY. 
MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN 
VIGOROUS IN SUGGESTING THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH NEEDS TO BE 
CONFIRMED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. 
BUT DOES THIS MAKE IT 
POLITICALLY UNTENABLE TO DO SO 
WITHOUT THE ONE WEEK DELAY? 
I THINK IT DOES. 
JEFF FLAKE APPEARS TO SUGGEST 
THAT HE WILL NOT VOTE UNLESS 
THE DELAY HAPPENS. 
IF JEFF FLAKE DOES NOT GO TO 
CONFIRM, I DO NOT SEE WHY 
COLLINS OR MAKOWSKI WOULD. 
CEMENT WE HEARD SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM SOFTEN HIS TONE. 
IT WAS DIFFERENT 24 HOURS AGO. 
SPENT EVEN THOUGH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP MAY NOT HAVE FULLY 
GRASPED WHAT IS GOING ON, THAT 
WAS A MUCH MORE MUTED TONE THAT 
WE HAVE HEARD FROM HIM OVER THE 
PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. 
IT IS CLEARLY A VERY FEBRILE 
ATMOSPHERE. 
ONE FINAL POINT. 
IT IS NOT JUST THE FACT THAT 
THERE IS THE ALLEGATIONS FROM 
DR. FOR THAT MADE THEM WANT TO 
GET IT OVER AND DONE WITH THAT 
BUT THE FEAR THAT THE LONGER 
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH HANGS OUT 
THERE THE MORE ALLEGATIONS 
COULD COME FORWARD. 
THE MORE THAT THE OTHER TWO 
WOMEN THAT HAVE MADE SEPARATE 
ALLEGATIONS COULD DEMAND THEIR 
MOMENT IN FRONT OF SOME FORM OF 
TESTIMONY. 
SO ALL OF THE PROBLEMS JUST 
MULTIPLY. 
MITCH McCONNELL CERTAINLY HAS 
GOT A HEADACHE AT BEST. 
>> I AM LOOKING AT THE 
CALENDAR. 
WE HAVE GOT A MONTH. 
WE HAVE GOT A MONTH. 
THE SUPREME COURT IS SEATED ON 
MONDAY. 
IT IS THE LAST FRIDAY IN 
SEPTEMBER. 
WE HAVE GOT FOUR WEEKS. 
THERE IS NO PLAN B THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE HAS SAID IF HE DOES 
NOT GO THROUGH. 
>> Reporter: LET'S UNPACK A BIT 
OF THIS BUT IT WAS NOT EVEN THE 
CHANGE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF 
LINDSEY GRAHAM BUT IN THE LAST 
FEW HOURS. 
WE STARTED THIS MORNING AND IT 
WAS MUCH MORE HOSTILE, KIND OF 
BRISTLING AT THE IDEA OF 
SLOWING THE MOMENTUM AND WE ARE 
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD 100 MILES 
PER HOUR TO HAVE THIS VOTE.  
REGARDLESS OF WHO IS WITH US OR 
NOT. 
DR. FORD WAS GIVEN TO HER DUE, 
CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY AND 
LET'S GO AHEAD AND PROCEED WITH 
IT IT WAS -- IT IS THE FEMALE 
CENTERS THAT SAID, WHAT WOULD 
AN FBI INVESTIGATION INTO THIS 
ISSUE -- IT WOULD CERTAINLY 
ILLUMINATE AND IT WOULD 
CERTAINLY HELP AND THEN COLLINS 
-- THERE IS SOME REPORTING, I 
DO NOT KNOW HOW TO, SAY THAT 
THEY WERE A BIT CONCERNED AT 
THE TONE AND TEMPERAMENT THAT 
THE JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAD 
YESTERDAY DEFENDING HIMSELF. 
THERE IS THE IDEA THAT THERE 
ARE TWO SIDES OF IT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WHEN HE DRINKS AND 
WHEN HE DOES NOT. 
THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES CAUSING
PAUSE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 
SAYING THAT TONE, THAT SIGNAL 
THAT IT IS SENDING THAT IT IS 
SERIOUS ENOUGH. 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE WAY THAT 
HE WOULD VOTE ON AN ISSUE BUT 
THIS IS PERSONAL CHARACTER AND 
TEMPERAMENT AND JUST TAKING 
ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THIS IS REALLY BEEN A 
THOROUGHLY DOING THEIR DUE 
DILIGENCE WILL GIVE COMFORT TO 
A LOT OF EVEN REPUBLICANS LIKE 
MYSELF WHO ARE REALLY CONCERNED 
ABOUT THAT. 
>> WE ARE GETTING INFORMATION 
ABOUT SENATOR MURKOWSKI AND HE 
IS SAYING THEY -- SHE SAYS THAT 
SHE SUPPORTS SAYING  THEY -- 
DELAYING THAT VOTE. 
DO WE KNOW IF SHE IS IN FAVOR 
OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION? 
WE DO NOT KNOW IF SHE IS IN 
FAVOR OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION. 
WE ARE HEARING THAT SHE IS IN 
FAVOR OF DELAYING THE VOTE. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU. 
LESLIE WAS TALKING ABOUT TOWN. 
THE PHRASE THAT I HAVE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT IS, WHEN ASKED ABOUT 
MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS, WHAT IS 
THE MESSAGE YOU HAVE? 
I HAVE NO MESSAGE THEY HAVE TO 
DO WHAT IS RIGHT THAT STRUCK ME 
AS SUCH A DIFFERENT TONE? 
MAKE IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY 
HAS BEEN IN HIS EAR A LITTLE 
BIT AND TELLING HIM THAT THE 
BEST THING RIGHT NOW IS NOT A 
DONALD TRUMP TWEETING STORM OR 
INTENSE PRESSURE BUT THESE ARE 
VERY -- WE SAW HOW QUICKLY 
WITHIN 30 MINUTES THIS CHANGED 
INSIDE THE COMMITTEE ROOM FOR 
THESE ARE VERY, VERY TENSE 
MOMENTS. 
THEY ARE VERY HIGH-STAKES 
THINGS GOING ON. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE VERY 
CAREFUL WITH HIS RHETORIC AND 
WITH HIS TONE. 
A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WANT 
TO POINT OUT. 
TIME. 
YOU BROUGHT UP TIME EARLIER BUT 
TIME IS NOT THE FRIEND OF 
SENATE REPUBLICANS THAT BELIEVE 
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE 
ON THE SUPREME COURT. 
I BROUGHT THIS UP YESTERDAY. 
I WAS IN THE SENATE WHEN WE 
WENT THROUGH THIS WITH A 
DIFFERENT ISSUE, HEALTHCARE, 
AND 20 -- AND WHAT WE FOUND IS 
THAT MORE TIME DID NOT DO 
ANYTHING TO HELP US PASS THE 
BILL THAT WE WANT TO DO PASS. 
IT WATERED IT DOWN AND IT ENDED 
UP HURTING US IN THE FOLLOWING 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
IF YOU REMEMBER, THIS WAS SCOTT 
BROWN REPLACING TED KENNEDY. 
THAT WAS A BAD CYCLE FOR 
DEMOCRATS. 
IN PART, PART OF WHY THAT 
HAPPENED IS BECAUSE TIME 
DRAGGED OUT AND THERE WAS MORE 
BAD STUFF ABOUT THE BILL. 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE NACVE TO 
THINK THAT ONLY GOOD THINGS ARE 
GOING TO COME OUT ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
JUST IN THE TIME WE HAVE BEEN 
HERE, ANOTHER BIG STORY THAT 
CAME OUT, TALKING ABOUT WHAT 
SENATE REPUBLICAN STAFFERS DUE 
TO POTENTIALLY GUM UP THE WORKS 
IN TERMS OF MORE ACCUSERS OR 
MORE CONCERNS ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BEING HEARD. 
TIME IS NOT THE FRIEND OF 
REPUBLICANS AND THE LAST THING 
THAT I WILL SAY IS GANGS. 
GANG OF FOUR. 
IT IS NOT JUST JEFF FLAKE. 
JEFF FLAKE HAS THE POLITICAL 
CAPITAL --  HE IS THE ONLY 
PERSON UP THERE BUT IT IS NOT 
COINCIDENTAL THAT JEFF FLAKE 
DOES NOT HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION 
TO GO BACK ON THE BALLOT BOX. 
THESE OTHER SENATORS ARE 
DEPENDING ON HIM TO GIVE THEM 
THE COVER, THE AIR COVER, TO BE 
ABLE TO HAVE THIS POSITION. 
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO 
NOTE AS WELL. 
>> THAT IS WHERE THE 
RELATIONSHIPS MATTER A TIDE IN 
THE SENATE. 
JEFF FLAKE DOES NOT HAVE A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AT ALL. 
YOU CAN SAY IT IS NEGATIVE. 
IN FACT, HE HAS BEEN A TOP 
CRITIC OF THE PRESIDENT WHICH 
IS WHY IT WAS SO REMARKABLE 
THIS MORNING WHEN HE CAME OUT 
WITH THAT NO VOTE AND REMEMBER 
THE VIDEO THAT WAS PLAYING OF 
THE PROTESTER CORNERING HIM IN 
THE ELEVATOR. 
YOU COULD SENSING HER VOICE AND 
WHAT SHE WAS SAYING TO HIM HOW 
EMOTIONAL THIS IS EVER 
QUESTIONS TO HIM ARE QUESTIONS 
THAT A LOT OF WOMEN IN THIS 
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN PUTTING TO 
LAWMAKERS ELSEWHERE. 
CLEARLY THAT MOMENT RAISED SOME 
QUESTIONS. 
POLITICALLY SPEAKING, THE 
QUESTION THAT I HAD YESTERDAY 
WAS WHY BRETT KAVANAUGH WOULD 
NOT JUST AGREE TO AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
REPUBLICANS ESPECIALLY A 
REPUBLICAN LIKE JEFF FLAKE, FOR 
WHOM THE SUPREME COURT IS A KEY 
ISSUE -- I MEAN, HE IS A 
TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVE AS FAR 
AS THE COURTS ARE CONCERNED IN 
SOME OTHER ISSUES. 
WHY NOT HAVE THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION TO ALLEVIATE ANY 
QUESTIONS THAT THE PUBLIC MIGHT 
HAVE? 
EVEN IF THEY ARE INCONCLUSIVE? 
AT LEAST SAYING THAT WE DID 
EVERYTHING WE DID WE COULD TO 
TRY TO INVESTIGATE THIS AND 
THIS IS THE INFORMATION WE 
HAVE. 
WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. 
POLITICALLY SPEAKING, IT SEEMS 
TO BE AN ADVANTAGE FOR 
REPUBLICANS IF THEY ARE TO GO 
AHEAD AND DO THIS. 
>> WE WERE TALKING A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT LEVERAGE AND PRESSURE. 
I WOULD LOVE TO ASK SENATOR 
FLAKE TODAY EXACTLY HOW MUCH 
THE PROTESTERS IN THAT ELEVATOR 
MAY HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I WANT 
TO PLAY YOU THE VIDEO THAT OUR 
PRODUCER ON CAPITOL HILL GOT. 
EXPECT I -- I TOLD THE STORY OF 
MY SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
TELLING THE TRUTH. 
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ALLOWING 
SOMEONE WHO IS ACTUALLY 
VIOLATED A WOMAN TO SIT IN THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
THIS IS NOT TOLERABLE. 
YOU HAVE CHILDREN. THINK ABOUT 
THEM. 
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN. 
I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT FOR THE 
NEXT 50 YEARS, THEY WILL HAVE 
SOMEBODY IN THE SUPREME COURT 
THAT HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF 
VIOLATING THAT YOUNG GIRL. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIR? 
>> NOBODY BELIEVED ME. 
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE AND YOU 
ARE TELLING ALL WOMEN THAT THEY 
DON'T MATTER. 
THAT THEY SHOULD STAY QUIET 
BECAUSE IF THEY TELL YOU WHAT 
HAPPENED TO THEM, YOU ARE GOING 
TO IGNORE THEM. 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND 
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE TELLING 
ALL WOMEN IN AMERICA. 
>> HE STOOD THERE IN SILENCE 
LISTENING AND THEN HE MADE A 
DRAMATIC REVERSAL. 
>> Reporter: I HAVE BEEN 
SPEAKING  WITH MEMBERS ON THE 
OTHER SIDE AND WE HAD 
CONVERSATIONS GOING ON WITH 
REGARD TO MAKING SURE THAT WE 
DO DUE DILIGENCE. 
I THINK IT WOULD BE PROPER TO 
DELAY THE FLOOR VOTE IN ORDER 
TO LET THE FBI CONTINUE TO DO 
AN INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN 
TIME AND SCOPE TO THE CURRENT 
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE THE AND 
LIMIT IT IN TIME TO NO MORE 
THAN ONE WEEK. 
I WOULD VOTE TO ADVANCE THE 
BILL TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT 
UNDERSTANDING. 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO A FEW OTHER 
MEMBERS ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE 
THAT MAY BE SUPPORTIVE AS WELL. 
THAT IS MY POSITION. 
I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO DO 
WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WE DO ALL DUE DILIGENCE WITH A 
NOMINATION THIS IMPORTANT AND I 
WANT TO SAY THAT THIS COMMITTEE 
HAS ACTED PROPERLY AND THE 
CHAIRMAN HAS BENT OVER 
BACKWARDS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS 
FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND TO DELAY
THIS VOTE IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR 
A WEEK SO THAT DR. FORD COULD 
BE HEARD AND SHE WAS YESTERDAY. 
SO THAT -- WITH THAT AGREEMENT, 
I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL 
TO THE FLOOR. 
>> WE ARE LEARNING THAT SENATOR 
MURKOWSKI, LISA MURKOWSKI IS, 
IN FACT, BEHIND SENATOR FLAKE, 
SAYING THAT SHE DOES SUPPORT A 
DELAY BUT WE DO NOT KNOW IF SHE 
SUPPORTS AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
OPTICS AND THE POLITICS. 
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? 
>> WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS 
THE SCIENCE FROM SENATOR 
COLLINS, THE THIRD REPUBLICAN 
THAT IS HERE. 
I THINK THAT REALLY, THE KEY 
THING IS, ARE REPUBLICANS 
INCLUDING MR. McCONNELL GOING TO
ACCEDE TO THIS DEMAND? 
I DO NOT SEE HOW THEY CANNOT. 
THIS INVESTIGATION HAS TO TAKE 
PLACE FOR A WEEK. 
IT IS JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY 
ROLLER COASTER THAT WE ARE ON 
WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO 
PREDICT ANYTHING. 
ROUGHLY 24 HOURS AGO AFTER DR. 
FORD FINISHED TESTIFYING I WAS 
SPEAKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE 
DONALD TRUMP LOYALISTS THAT 
WERE CONCERNED WITH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S FATE. 
SIX HOURS LATER, FOUR HOURS 
LATER THEY WERE BULLISH ABOUT 
IT AFTER HE TESTIFIED. 
TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE JEFF FLAKE 
WAS FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH AND NOW 
HE IS PULLING BACK FROM THAT. 
HOW MANY TWISTS ARE WE GOING TO 
HAPPEN THIS TALE? 
>> NO MATTER WHAT, WILL 
REPUBLICANS ULTIMATELY WIN? 
IF A BRETT KAVANAUGH MAKES IT 
TO THE COURT, THEY WIN AND IF 
HE DOES NOT, DOES IT THEN 
MOBILIZE THEIR BASE TO GET OUT 
IN NOVEMBER? 
>> I DO. 
I THINK THAT IT DOES 
ABSOLUTELY. 
I THINK THAT THERE ARE BIG 
POSITIVES. 
I AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT TIME 
KILLS DEALS AND IT WORKS AND 
THIS IS THAT WE, TOO BUT WHAT 
WOMEN NEED IS TO FEEL HURT BUT 
WE KNOW THIS. 
SENSITIVITY TRAINING, EVERYONE, 
IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW. 
THEY NEED TO FEEL HURT BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY THEY LIKE TO DO 
THEIR OWN THING -- DUE 
DILIGENCE AND THEY LIKE A THIRD 
PARTY SOURCE WHEN YOU TALK TO 
VOTERS AND TEMPERAMENT. 
THEY WANT TO KNOW IS THAT -- IT 
IS OUTSIDE OF THE POLITICAL 
PROCESS. 
THE FBI IS THE KEY. 
THEY ARE GOING TO PRESENT 
EVIDENCE BUT LET'S SAY THAT 
THEY COME FORWARD AND SAY WE 
HAVE READ IT AND SEEN IT 
PRIVATELY AND WE HAVE 
CONFIDENCE THAT HE IS 
QUALIFIED. 
THERE WILL BE A BIG SIGH OF 
RELIEF AND PEOPLE SAY, OKAY, WE 
TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT. 
YOU LOOK AT INDEPENDENT 
RESEARCH AND HUMAN FARMER WITH 
THE CONFIRMATION. 
THERE WILL BE A MUCH BETTER 
SUPPORT LAID OUT FOR THE JUDGE. 
IF YOU ROLLTHAT BACK, 
CONVERSELY, IF THEY SEE THIS 
INFORMATION AND PULL AWAY, THAT 
THEY WILL HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 
THAT AS WELL. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE A 
POINT. 
AS LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID, 
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO EXPLAIN 
THIS TO DONALD TRUMP WHEN 
SOMEBODY EXPLAINS IT TO DONALD 
TRUMP AND SAYS THAT THE FBI, 
THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 
BEATING UP ON FOR THE LAST 
THREE YEARS, SO WE ARE GOING TO 
ENTRUST THEM WITH THE FATE OF 
YOUR SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 
HOW IS THAT GOING TO PLAY? 
THIS PRESIDENT HAS TREATED THE 
FBI AS THE HOBBY HORSE TO BEAT 
ON FOR THE LAST TWO, THREE 
YEARS, TAKING ANY OUNCE OF 
CREDIBILITY THAT HE COULD TAKE 
OUT OF THEM WITH EVERY PASSING 
DAY. 
ISN'T IT REMARKABLE? 
ISN'T IT INTERESTING? 
NOW THE FBI COULD HOLD THE KEY 
TO HIS NOMINATION. 
I THINK THAT IS FASCINATING. 
I WONDER AGAIN, WHEN AS LINDSEY 
GRAHAM SAID, SOMEBODY EXPLAINS 
THIS TO DONALD TRUMP, HOW HE IS 
GOING TO REACT TO THAT REALITY. 
I SUSPECT WE WILL READ ABOUT IT 
ON TWITTER. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU. 
AS YOU LOOK FORWARD AND 
OBVIOUSLY MIDTERMS IS WHAT 
MAKES THIS LARGER MAGNITUDE. 
WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR DEMOCRATS 
AND REPUBLICANS ULTIMATELY? 
>> FOR REPUBLICANS, THE SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE WAS SUPPOSED TO 
BE A KEY SELLING POINT TO THEIR 
VOTERS, TO REMIND THEM, 
ESPECIALLY THOSE SOFT 
REPUBLICAN VOTERS OR 
INDEPENDENTLY MINDED REPUBLICANS
WHO TEND TO VOTE REPUBLICAN AND 
ESPECIALLY WOMEN THAT MAY BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE 
SAYING, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE 
EVERYTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS 
DOING AND HIS RHETORIC AND WHAT 
HE IS TALKING ABOUT BUT 
REMEMBER WHY YOU SUPPORTED HIM 
IN THE FIRST PLACE? 
REMEMBER WHAT WE WANTED TO 
ACCOMPLISH AS REPUBLICANS 
TOGETHER THE AGENDA? 
THE SUPREME COURT WAS SUPPOSED 
TO BE THAT AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY 
A KEY LEGISLATIVE -- SORRY -- A 
KEY LEGACY FOR THE PRESIDENT 
BECAUSE THIS IS A LIFETIME 
APPOINTMENT. 
THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR 
REPUBLICANS AND IT IS CLEAR 
THAT THEY WILL DO WHAT IT TAKES 
TO GET THAT THROUGH. 
FOR DEMOCRATS, WE KNOW THAT 
THEY'RE HIGHLY ENERGIZED AND 
MOBILIZED, READY TO COME OUT IN 
THE ELECTION. 
WE HAVE SEEN THAT BACKED UP BY 
THE PRIMARIES AND REPORTED 
NUMBERS OF THE TURNOUT. 
THE QUESTION IS, THAT THE -- 
DOES THE SUPREME COURT BECOME 
AN ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE FOR 
DEMOCRATS THE WAY IT HAS BEEN 
FOR REPUBLICANS? 
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 
ALSO WHAT IS REALLY TELLING 
ABOUT THE REASON THAT DEMOCRATS 
WANTED AN FBI INVESTIGATION IN 
THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE THEY 
KNOW THAT PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN 
CONGRESS RIGHT NOW IS AT A VERY 
LOW LEVEL. 
WE HAVE SEEN COMMITTEES THAT 
WERE TRADITIONALLY KNOWN FOR 
THEIR BIPARTISANSHIP. 
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND NOW 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THE 
SENATE. 
EVEN THOUGH DIANNE FEINSTEIN 
AND CHUCK GRASSLEY HAVE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP, THERE IS NOT THE 
LEVEL OF COMPETENCE IN THE 
PUBLIC THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE 
CONGRESS HANDLE IT. 
THE FBI INVESTIGATION IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE SEEN AS AN 
INDEPENDENT ARBITER TO MAKE 
PEOPLE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE 
WITH GOING FORWARD, EVEN THOUGH 
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY 
TRADITIONALLY GET INVOLVED IN. 
>> TALKING WITH DEMOCRATS AND 
THINKING ABOUT THE RED STATE 
DEMOCRATS, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO CHIME IN? 
>> RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE EVERY 
COVER TO CONTINUE THEIR 
OPPOSITION TO BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
THE PRESSURE FOR THEM WAS ONLY 
REALLY GOING TO BUILD IF 
REPUBLICANS WERE MONOLITHIC IN 
SUPPORTING BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 
WE ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS ALL 
A POLITICAL PLOY. 
THERE IS NO REAL INCENTIVE 
RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE RED STATE 
DEMOCRATS TO BACK A BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BUT TO PICK UP ON 
CAITLIN'S POINT AND LESLIE 
MENTIONED IT AS WELL. 
SUBURBAN WOMEN, WOMEN NOT AVID 
SUPPORTERS OF ONE PARTY OR THE 
OTHER ARE GOING TO BE CRUCIAL 
IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
OVERALL BACK IN 2016 DONALD 
TRUMP LOST WOMEN OVERALL BUT I 
THINK THAT HE KEPT CLINTON'S 
MARGIN TO 7 POINTS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT POLL 
SHOWING REPUBLICANS LOSING THE 
FEMALE VOTE BY 15, 20 POINTS 
AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE EVENTS 
OF THE PAST 48 HOURS. 
IF THAT GAP IS PROVEN BIGGER, 
THAT IS POTENTIALLY 
CATASTROPHIC FOR THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY. 
>> AS YOU ARE BREAKING DOWN HOW 
REPUBLICAN WOMEN ARE LOOKING AT 
THIS, THEY WERE A CRUCIAL 
VOTING BLOCK FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
. WHITE REPUBLICAN WOMEN IN 
PARTICULAR BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
THE SECTOR, HAVE YOU DONE ANY 
POLLING? 
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY POLLING ON 
HOW THEIR THOUGHTS WERE GOING 
INTO THIS? 
>> YOU HAD A MORNING POLITICAL 
POLL THAT SAID THAT REPUBLICAN 
WOMEN WERE DROPPING SUPPORT FOR 
BRETT KAVANAUGH BY 11 POINTS 
AND THAT IS BEFORE YOU HEARD 
THE TESTIMONY AND IF YOU GOT 
THEM BETWEEN THE TESTIMONES IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT 
STORY OVERALL. 
THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT DR. 
FORD -- IT WAS SO PASSIONATE 
AND SO COMPELLING THAT PEOPLE 
REALLY BELIEVE HER AND 100% 
IDENTITY OF IDENTIFYING THE 
ASSAULTER BEING BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
THAT IS A PROBLEM. 
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH NOT TO 
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE, AND I DO 
NOT WANT TO DO THE FBI THING, 
MARK JUDGE IS A RECOVERING 
ADDICT AND WE CANNOT REALLY 
RELY ON HIS JUDGMENT ANYWAY. 
THAT IS ALMOST WHAT THEY WERE 
TRYING TO DO IS MINIMIZE THAT 
PERSON AS A WITNESS. 
IT JUST SEEMED ODD AND THEN HIS 
TEMPERAMENT. 
SO IT LEFT A LOT OF UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS THAT REPUBLICANS NEED 
TO ADDRESS IF THEY WANT TO KEEP 
THE REPUBLICANS. 
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RED 
STATE DEMOCRATS. 
JOE MANSION SAYS THAT HE 
SUPPORTS JEFF FLAKE'S CALL FOR 
AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 
SPIRIT I THINK THAT WE ARE 
HEARING THE GANG OF FOUR COME 
OUT AND REVEAL THEMSELVES. 
WE HAD JEFF FLAKE AND MURKOWSKI 
AND NOW WE HAVE GOT MANSION AND 
THE WATCH WILL BE ON FOR HEIDI 
HEITKAMP OR FOR SUSAN COLLINS. 
THAT MAKES SENSE AND I TAKE 
YOUR POINT EARLIER ABOUT RED 
STATE DEMOCRATS. 
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THEY 
STILL FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE. 
PRETTY GOOD CONTACTS WITH SOME 
REALLY HIGH-PROFILE RED STATE 
DEMOCRATS AND THEY HONEST-TO-
GOODNESS DO NOT FEEL LIKE ANY 
OF THIS HAS TAKEN THEM OFF THE 
GRIDDLE. 
THEY THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS STILL WILDLY POPULAR IN SOME 
OF THEIR STATES, PLACES LIKE 
NORTH DAKOTA, WEST VIRGINIA, 
MONTANA, EVEN THOUGH WE HEARD 
TESTER COME OUT AGAINST BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BUT WE KNOW THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS POPULAR THERE AND 
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT IS NOT 
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH BUT IT IS 
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. 
THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
COUNTRY DO NOT SEE THIS AS 
BRETT KAVANAUGH BUT THEY SEE IT 
AS DONALD TRUMP IF I KNOW 
ANYTHING ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
I BET THAT NONE OF THE PEOPLE 
IN WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH 
DAKOTA, NO OFFENSE, PROBABLY 
COULD NOT CITE CASELAW FROM 
BRETT KAVANAUGH OR ANY PARTS OF 
HIS RESUME BUT THEY KNOW THAT 
HE IS DONALD TRUMP'S CHOICE AND 
THAT IS JOE MANSION OR HEIDI 
HEITKAMP OR JOE DONNELLY GOES 
AGAINST THEM, THAT MEANS THAT 
THEY ARE GOING AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT. 
I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE 
HOW THE RIVALS ARE GOING TO 
PLAY. 
WE SAW MIKE BRAUN IN INDIANA 
COMING OUT STRONGLY TO TRY TO 
BRACKET JOE DONNELLY ON THAT 
ISSUE. 
I IMAGINE WE WILL SEE THE SAME 
THING EVEN THOUGH MANSION HAS 
NOT COMMITTED. 
I DO NOT KNOW IF THE PRESS 
RELEASE WILL GO OUT AFTER JEFF 
FLAKE DID THIS. 
>> ONE SECOND THAT WE HAVE A 
PRESS RELEASE FROM JOE MANSION 
AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS BUT 
FOLLOWING THE STATEMENT OF 
SENATOR FLAKE, CALLING FOR THE 
ONE WEEK FBI INVESTIGATION, I'M 
CODY, I APPLAUD THE DECISION TO 
RISE ABOVE THE PARTISAN CIRCUS 
ON DISPLAY DURING THIS ENTIRE 
PROCESS. 
IT TOOK COURAGE TO TAKE A STAND 
AND CALL FOR A ONE WEEK FBI 
DESICCATION TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THIS HAS BEEN A PARTISAN AND A 
DIVISIVE PROCESS. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
PULLED APART BY THIS ENTIRE 
SPECTACLE AND WE NEED TO TAKE 
TIME TO ADDRESS THESE CLAIMS 
INDEPENDENTLY SO THAT OUR 
COUNTRY CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 
THE OUTCOME OF THIS VOTE BUT IT 
IS WHAT IS RIGHT AND FAIR FOR 
DR. FORD, JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
ANYBODY SURPRISED? 
>> NO. 
IN TERMS OF JUST GOING BACK TO 
THE BARE POLITICS OF THIS, 
ASSUMING THAT NOTHING COMES OUT 
OF THIS INVESTIGATION, IT DOES 
GIVE THOSE RED STATE DEMOCRATS 
SOME COVER TO SAY, LOOK, I DID 
SUPPORT LOOKING AT THIS 
FURTHER. 
I DID NOT COME OUT RIGHT AWAY I 
SUPPORT HIM. 
I DID NOT COME OUT RIGHT AWAY 
AND DENY HIM. 
I AM DOING MY DUE DILIGENCE AS 
A MEMBER OF THE SENATE WERE 
ADVISE AND CONSENT IS OR TO THE 
DUTY OF THE UPPER CHAMBER. 
I THINK THIS WORKS WELL FOR 
THEM RIGHT NOW. 
AGAIN, BARRING NOTHING COMES 
UP, IF SOMETHING DOES COME UP, 
THEY ARE ABLE TO SAY, THE FBI, 
INDEPENDENT BODY, FOUND THIS 
INFORMATION. 
SELECT JUST TO JUMP IN QUICKLY, 
I THINK THAT WE ARE ALL 
DISCUSSING THIS ON THE BASIS 
THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATION THAT 
I UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE NOT 
DOING THAT. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DENIES 
WRONGDOING. 
WHAT IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE? 
WHAT IF THEY DO IN FACT CUT -- 
UNCOVER SOME DAMAGING 
INFORMATION? 
WHAT IF MORE ALLEGATIONS COME 
FORWARD THAT ARE SEEN AS 
CREDIBLE AND NOT JUST SOME 
PARTS EMPLOYEE OR SOMETHING 
FROM THE FRINGES? 
THEN YOU ARE IN A VERY SERIOUS 
SITUATION DOES THAT BLOWBACK ON 
THOSE REPUBLICAN SENATORS THAT 
IT'S RADICALLY WANTED TO GO 
AHEAD WITH THE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION? 
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO 
DEFY THESE CALLS TO HOLD BACK? 
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
THAT WE WILL NOT KNOW THE 
ANSWER TO FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT 
LEAST. 
>>> THE INTERESTING PART IS 
THAT MANY REPUBLICANS FEEL THAT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS FALSELY 
ACCUSED AND THEY POINT TO THAT 
HE WAS A CIRCUS LEADER OF SOME 
GANG RAPE KIND OF POSSE AND 
THAT RIDICULOUS EXTREME, THESE 
ANONYMOUS LETTERS THAT CAME IN. 
THEY POINT TO ALL OF THAT. 
HE IS DEFENDING HIMSELF BECAUSE 
HE IS ACCUSED OF NOT DOING THIS 
UNDER THE PRETENSE OF A JUDGE. 
OKAY. 
THOSE ARE VERY FAIR ARGUMENTS 
AND IT IS POLITICIZED. 
LET'S ASSUME, I SEE A SCENARIO 
WHERE YOU CAN SEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH CONFIRM THAT YOU COME 
BACK AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT 
COMES OUT THAT IS ANY DIFFERENT 
THERE IS A LITTLE OF THE HEAT 
IS TAKEN OFF OF THE SPIRIT AND 
LOOKED REASONABLE AND THEY CAME 
TO AGREE THAT HE IS QUALIFIED 
AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED IN 35 
YEARS BUT WE CANNOT RESOLVE 
THAT. 
THEY MOVE FORWARD. 
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A GREAT 
BODY OF LOVE FOR HIM BUT AT 
LEAST IT IS A SENSIBLE SOLUTION 
I THINK THAT IS WHAT WOMEN 
PARTICULARLY SWEET WOMEN ARE 
LOOKING FOR. 
SWING VOTERS, REPUBLICAN OR 
MAN. 
MALE OR FEMALE. 
I THINK THAT THESE FOLKS ARE 
LOOKING FOR A REASON TO SAY 
YES. 
MANSION, JEFF FLAKE, SUSAN 
COLLINS, MURKOWSKI TO A LESSER 
EXTENT. 
THEY WANT A REASON TO SAY YES. 
THEY ARE WAITING TO LOOK FOR A 
REASON TO SAY YES AND THEY'RE 
WAITING TO SEE IF MAYBE WITH 
TIME AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 
TIME, MAYBE TIME TAKES THE 
PRESSURE OFF. 
WHAT IS INTERESTING IF YOU ARE 
JOE MANSION I THINK IT IS IN 
YOUR INTEREST TO GET THIS 
RESOLVED, THAT THIS OUT-OF-THE-
WAY AND GET BACK TO TALKING 
ABOUT HEALTHCARE AND HOW MUCH 
THE REPUBLICANS SCREWED OVER 
YOUR ESTATE WITH HEALTHCARE AND 
THE TAX BILL AND THINGS LIKE 
THAT, THAT WORK IN YOUR FAVOR 
FROM THE POLLS. 
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I DO 
NOT THINK JOE MANSION WANTED TO 
HANG OUT ANY LONGER. 
>> WE HAVE GOT TO HIT A BREAK 
AND CAFFEINATED BEVERAGE. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE 
BREAK RIGHT NOW. 
WE HAVE GOT ERROR CONTINUING 
COVERAGE. 
AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN THE 
U.S. SENATE. 
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> HI, EVERYONE. 
I AM REENA NINAN. 
A DRAMATIC AFTERNOON PLAYING 
OUT ON CAPITOL HILL AS A 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR CALLS FOR A 
DELAY IN THE CONFIRMATION OF 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
JEFF FLAKE HAD A MAJOR REVERSAL.
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
WAS PREPARING TO VOTE AND HE 
SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO 
VOTE IN COMMITTEE BUT HE WANTED 
A WEEKLONG DELAY FOR THE FBI TO 
LOOK INTO ALLGATIONS OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT AGAINST THE SUPREME OR 
NOMINEE BEFORE A FULL SENATE 
VOTE. 
>> I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH A 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER 
SIDE. 
WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS ON 
GOING FOR A WHILE WITH REGARD 
TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO DUE 
DILIGENCE HERE, AND I THINK IT 
WOULD BE PROPER TO DELAY THE 
FLOOR VOTE FOR UP TO BUT NOT 
MORE THAN ONE WEEK IN ORDER TO 
LET THE FBI CONTINUE -- TO DO AN
INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN TIME 
AND SCOPE, TO THE CURRENT 
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE THERE. 
>> THIS COMES AFTER A DAY OF 
EMOTIONAL, HIGH-STAKES 
TESTIMONY BY BOTH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND HIS ACCUSER, DR. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD ON THE 
HELP IT FORD SAYS SHE IS 100% 
CERTAIN IT IS KAVANAUGH THAT 
TRY TO RAPE HER WHILE THEY WERE 
IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH DENIES THE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
PRIOR TO THE DELAY,  IT WAS 
UNCLEAR IF REPUBLICANS HAD THE 
VOTES TO CONFIRM BRETT 
KAVANAUGH.  
LISA MURKOWSKI SAYS SHE BACKS 
JEFF FLAKE'S CALL FOR A DELAY 
AND JOE MANSION, DECIDE, BACKS 
THE IDEA AS WELL. 
THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR THE 
SENATE TO VOTE. 
IN THE WAKE OF TODAY'S 
DEVELOPERS, HE SAID HE JUST 
WANTS THINGS TO WORK OUT WELL 
FOR THE COUNTRY. 
HE ALSO HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT 
YESTERDAY'S GUT WRENCHING 
TESTIMONY. 
>> I FEEL LIKE HER TESTIMONY 
WAS VERY COMPELLING AND SHE 
LOOKS LIKE A VERY FINE WOMAN TO 
ME. 
A VERY FINE WOMAN. 
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, 
LIKEWISE, WAS REALLY SOMETHING 
THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. 
IT WAS INCREDIBLE. 
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT, I 
THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
BUT CERTAINLY SHE WAS A VERY 
CREDIBLE WITNESS. 
SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY 
RESPECTS, AND I THINK THAT -- I 
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO 
CONTINUE ONWARD OR IF WE ARE 
GOING TO GET A VOTE. 
>> CBS NEWS POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT IT O'KEEFE JOINS 
US FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
I KNOW THAT MORE AND MORE 
SENATORS ARE SUPPORTED  -- 
SUPPORTIVE OF THE DELAY. 
>> Reporter: IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES, JOE MANSION, THE 
DEMOCRAT IN WEST VIRGINIA SAID 
THAT HE IS ON BOARD WITH JEFF 
FLAKE'S IDEA.  
SO IS LISA MURKOWSKI, THE 
REPUBLICAN OUT OF ALASKA, 
WALKING INTO THE CAPITAL 
SHORTLY AFTER THE DRAMA IN THE 
BUILDING BROKE UP, SAYING, 
YEAH, I, TOO, AM ON BOARD THAT 
IS AN UPPER THREE MODERATES, 
TWO REPUBLICANS, ONE DEMOCRAT 
SAY THAT I DO NOT WANT TO MOVE 
FORWARD UNTIL THE FBI GETS THE 
BALL. 
THERE IS A GROUP OF REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS OVER AT THE OFFICE OF 
MITCH McCONNELL DISCUSSING THIS 
AND MAKING CLEAR THAT YOU DO 
NOT HAVE THE MATH AND UNLESS 
AND UNTIL YOU AGREE WITH THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION YOU PROBABLY 
WILL NOT SO MANSION A LITTLE 
WHILE AGO PUTTING OUT A 
STATEMENT THAT SAYS IN PART OF 
MY APOLOGY -- SENATOR JEFF 
FLAKE'S DECISION TO RISE ABOVE 
THE PARTISAN CIRCUS ON DISPLAY 
DURING THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. 
IT TOOK COURAGE, HE SAYS, TO 
TAKE A STAND AND CALL FOR A ONE-
WEEK FBI INVESTIGATION TO GET 
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
HE SAYS LATER IT IS RIGHT AND 
FAIR FOR DR. FORD, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
THIS PATIENT THEY MENTION TIME 
AND THERE ARE OTHER MODERATE 
DEMOCRATS. 
MANSION IS FACING PRESSURE TO 
SUPPORT BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
THIS WILL PLAY OUT FOR ANOTHER 
WEEK. 
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
WHAT WE ARE WAITING RIGHT NOW 
IS SIGNAL FROM THE CAPITAL, 
DOWN TO THE WHITE HOUSE THAT 
YOU GOT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 
THE FBI INVESTIGATION OR SHALL 
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH NOMINATION 
ENTIRELY. 
>> ANYTHING FROM MITCH 
McCONNELL? 
>> Reporter: NO. 
THEY ARE MEETING IN HIS OFFICE 
RIGHT NOW, AS WE SPEAK.  
WE HAVE GOT NO SIGNALS FROM HIS 
AIDES OR FROM HIM, HIMSELF. 
WE MIGHT LATER THIS AFTERNOON. 
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. 
IT O'KEEFE COMING TO US FROM 
CAPITOL HILL. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  
WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING EARLIER 
ABOUT -- LET ME INTRODUCE THE 
PANEL. 
KATELYN HUEY BURNS, JOINING US, 
NIALL STANEK, LESLIE SANCHEZ 
AND JOEL AS WELL, JILL PENA. 
LET ME START WITH YOU. 
WE WERE TALKING LAST NIGHT. WE 
WERE ALL DISCUSSING ABOUT 2020. 
I KNOW THAT THIS IS -- I WANT 
TO TAKE A BIG STEP BACK. 
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT 2020. 
THERE WERE A LOT OF MOMENTS IN 
THE TESTIMONY YESTERDAY OF 
POTENTIAL FOLKS, PRODUCING THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT MIGHT BE 
RUNNING. 
>> THERE WERE. 
BROOKER, CAMILLA HARRIS, INSIDE 
THE COMMITTEE BUT WE HAVE NOT 
EVEN -- LET'S THINK ABOUT 
ELIZABETH WARREN AND ABOUT 
BERNIE SANDERS, JOE BIDEN WHO, 
BY THE WAY, CAME UP 
TANGENTIALLY A COUPLE TIMES 
TODAY, NOT JUST FOR HIS ROLE 
BACK WITH ANITA HILL, 25 YEARS 
AGO, BUT ALSO FOR SOME 
PRESIDENT THAT HE ESTABLISHED 
ON THE COMMITTEE. 
IT IS HERE. 
BOTH WITH THE INDIVIDUALS BUT 
ALSO WITH THE FRAMING OF THE 
ISSUES. 
RIGHT? 
AGAIN, THIS IS NOT GENERALLY AN 
ORGANIZING ISSUE THAT DEMOCRATS 
USE. 
DEMOCRATS DO NOT GENERALLY VOTE 
ON THE SUPREME COURT. 
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT 
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
BUILD A GIGANTIC LEAD, NOT JUST 
WITH THE SUPREME COURT BUT WITH 
A LOWER COURTS, ETC. 
THAT CHANGES. 
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO TREAT 
THIS AS AN ORGANIZING ISSUE. 
I AM SURE OF IT. 
NOT JUST BECAUSE IT IS A 
DEMOCRATIC ISSUE BUT BECAUSEIT 
IS A WOMAN'S ISSUE AND THE FACT 
THAT WOMEN ARE AT THE FOREFRONT.
RECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN RUNNING 
FOR SENATE, HOUSE, GOVERNORS 
RACES, ALL LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT. 
THIS IS A GAME CHANGER IN TERMS 
OF 2020. 
I DO NOT THINK THAT THIS IS 
GOING TO BE A BACK BURNER ISSUE 
FOR DEMOCRATS. 
>> WE HAVE SEEN TO YOUR POINT 
ABOUT WOMEN AND BEING AN 
OUTSIZED CONSTITUENCY AND CORE 
CONSTITUENCY FOR EVERYBODY 
RUNNING IN 2015 INCLUDING THE 
CANDIDATES THEMSELVES AT A 
RECORD PACE IN TERMS OF WOMEN 
CANDIDATES. 
YOU HAVE SEEN FROM REPUBLICANS 
AND THE PRESIDENT, STARTING TO 
REALIZE THAT THIS IS A REALLY 
POTENTIALLY BIG ISSUE IN TERMS 
OF WOMEN AND THE SENSITIVITIES 
AROUND THAT. 
LISTENIG TO THE PRESIDENTS 
STATEMENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
TODAY, I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY 
REMARKABLE, CALLING CHRISTINE 
FORD'S TESTIMONY COMPELLING AND 
CALLING HER A FINE WOMAN. 
ESSENTIALLY GIVING HER A 
CREDENCE WHICH WAS REALLY 
INTERESTING. 
THE REPUBLIAN SENATORS KNOW 
THAT THE OPTICS OF YESTERDAY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE HAD 
THEY BEEN THE ONES QUESTIONING 
FORD. 
CERTAINLY THAT IS PLAYING INTO 
ALL OF THIS. 
>> THERE IS ALSO THIS ONE 
MOMENT WHEN YOU SEE HER, RACHEL 
MITCHELL, QUESTIONING AND 
SILENT REPUBLICAN SAID -- 
SENATORS AND SOMEBODY TWEETED 
OUT, I BELIEVE IT WAS MOM'S 
DEMAND JUSTICE, TWEETING OUT, 
WHY NOT VOTE MORE WOMEN AND IF 
IT TAKES A WOMAN TO DO THE 
QUESTIONING? 
I AGREE COMPLETELY. 
LET'S  THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS GONE TO THIS IS A CONCEPT 
TO THE ONE HOUR PRESS 
CONFERENCE WHERE HE SAID I HAVE 
BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED AND THE 
TWO DOZEN WOMEN ALL OF THEM AND 
CORRECTED RECEPTION AND SO HE 
WAS LOOKING AT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
THROUGH THAT CAMERA LENS AND 
THEN VERY QUICK TO DEFEND HIM 
AT ALL COST AND MANY OF THE 
REPUBLICAN STUDY LINE, LINDSEY 
GRAHAM LEADING THAT MARCH. 
WE HEARD HER AND WE HEARD HIM. 
WE BELIEVE HER. 
WE BELIEVE HIM. 
CONFUSED OR FALSE IDENTITY, 
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY IS THE 
WAY THAT THEY RECONCILE IT. 
LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD 
BUT I THINK THAT IS WHERE THE 
CRY AND THE HEAT WAS GETTING SO 
INTENSE. 
REALLY CALM HER VOICES, A 
POLITICAL WIN AT WHAT COST? 
WE BELIEVE THAT REPUBLICANS 
SHOULD HAVE THE SEED AND 
REPUBLICANS DESERVE THE SEAT 
BECAUSE OF THE WIN IN 2016. 
IS HE THE BEST CANDIDATE? 
I THINK HE COULD BE. 
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A REASON 
TO VOTE YES, THE SENATORS ARE, 
AND GIVING IT THIS PAUSE COULD 
GIVE THEM THAT. 
>>> WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE 
ELEVATION, BRINKSMANSHIP IN THE 
BATTLE IN COURT. 
YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK ABOUT 
THIS, NOT JUST ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
THIS IS ABOUT MERRICK GARLAND. 
IT IS ABOUT HARRY REID, NUCLEAR 
OPTION ON THE COURT A COUPLE OF 
YEARS AGO, AND IT IS ABOUT 
BOARD. 
OKAY? 
THIS IS A BATTLE FOR THE COURT 
THAT HAS BEEN ELEVATING FOR 
PROBABLY THE PAST 20+ YEARS AND 
REALLY IT IS REACHING CRESCENDO 
POINT. 
I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS 
ANY SIGNS THAT THIS IS GOING TO 
BACK OFF. 
ÃºI AM INTERESTED IN Y 
REPORTING IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT 
WOULD SAY. 
I DO NOT GET THE SENSE THAT 
THIS IS -- ANYBODY'S GOING TO 
COME IN AND BE LIKE, YOU KNOW 
WHAT? 
LET'S JUST LOOK PAST ALL OF THE 
ORIGINAL SINS OF THE PAST. 
LET'S LOOK FAR. 
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT NOBODY IS 
GOING TO UNILATERALLY DISARM OR 
VOLUNTEER TO DO THAT. 
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE 
THIS OUT OF THE SENATE. 
TAKE IT OUT OF THE SUPREME 
COURT NOMINATION IN AND OF 
ITSELF. 
THIS HAS BECOME A CULTURAL 
RECKONING IN THIS COUNTRY. 
YOU MENTIONED YESTERDAY DURING 
THE LIVE COVERAGE THAT THE 
WORLD IS KIND OF WATCHING ALL 
OF THIS BECAUSE THIS IS 
SPEAKING TO SO MANY DIFFERENT 
ISSUES OF IDENTITY, OF WOMEN, 
OF ISSUES THAT OUR COUNTRY IS 
FACING ON MULTIPLE FRONTS. 
SO THIS HAS TAKEN A SIGNIFICANCE
AND IT HAS BECOME ACCESSIBLE TO 
PEOPLE BEYOND JUST THE NEXT 
SUPREME COURT PICK? 
RICK WE TALK ABOUT WOMEN AND 
WHAT A KEY ISSUE AND MOMENT 
THIS WAS. 
WE ALSO LOOK BACK AT ANITA HILL 
IN THE 26 YEARS. 
I HAD RITA BRAVER ON, SUNNY 
MORNING, CORRESPOND TO, A 
CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT FOR 
CBS NEWS AT THE TIME. 
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE 
ACTUALLY FEELS IN THOSE 26 
YEARS WHAT LITTLE HAS CHANGED 
WHEN IT COMES TO PROGRESS FOR 
WOMEN AND SEXUAL ASSAULT 
>> IT WAS CLEAR YESTERDAY THAT 
THE COMMITTEE, THAT SAME 
COMMITTEE, HAD STILL NOT REALLY 
FIGURED OUT HOW TO HANDLE THIS. 
IT WAS REMARKABLE. 
ORRIN HATCH, RETIRING THIS SOON 
AND CHUCK GRASSLEY WERE THERE 
IN THAT ROOM. 
THERE ARE STILL NO REPUBLICAN 
WOMEN ON THAT SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 
THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF 
THEM STILL IN CONGRESS RIGHT 
NOW. 
SO IT IS REMARKABLE. WE TALK 
ABOUT HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED 
SINCE THEN AND WE ALSO NEED TO 
ALK ABOUT HOW LITTLE HA 
CHANGED AND HOW MUCH REMAINS 
THE SAME. 
>> I WANT TO PLAY -- I'M 
CURIOUS IF SENATOR FLAKE WOULD 
SAY THAT THIS WAS A PIVOTAL 
MOMENT THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED 
HIS DECISION ON HOW HE VOTES. 
HE WAS CONFRONTED BY SOME 
PROTESTERS IN AN ELEVATOR AS HE 
WAS EXITING. 
>> I TOLD THE STORY OF MY 
SEXUAL ASSAULT I TOLD THEM -- 
TELLING THE TRUTH. 
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ALLOWING 
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY VIOLATED A 
WOMAN TO SIT IN THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
THIS IS NOT TOLERABLE. 
YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN YOUR 
FAMILY. 
THINK ABOUT THEM. 
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN. 
I CANNOT IMAGINE FOR THE NEXT 
50 YEARS THEY WILL HAVE TO HAVE 
SOMEONE IN THE SUPREME COURT 
THAT HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF 
VIOLATING A YOUNG GIRL. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIR? 
>> NOBODY BELIEVES ME. 
I DID NOT TELL ANYONE AND YOU 
ARE TELLING ALL WOMEN THAT IF 
YOU TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENS, YOU 
ARE GOING TO IGNORE THEM. 
THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ALL 
WOMEN IN AMERICA. 
>> I WANT TO TURN TO JOE PAIN. 
YOU SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME 
ON CAPITOL HILL. 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW 
OPTICS MATTER PICKETS I WAS 
SENATOR FLAKE, WHAT DO YOU DO? 
>> HE HANDLED THAT THE BEST 
THAT HE COULD. 
WE HAD CHATTER THAT MAYBE STAFF 
COULD HAVE HELPED HIM OUT. 
CURIOUS AS TO WHERE THAT WAS, 
IN THE MEMBERS ONLY AREA AND 
CLEARLY IT WAS NOT. 
I THINK THAT IF CITIZENS ARE 
WATCHING WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT AN 
HOUR OR TWO HOURS LATER, THAT 
MATTERS. 
THAT TYPE OF ADVOCACY MATTERS. 
YOU CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF US AT SOME 
POINT IN OUR CAREER SPENT TIME 
IN CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE. 
YOU GET THE LETTERS AND EMAILS. 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK IT 
DOESN'T MATTER. 
PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION. 
IF YOU GET 10,000 LETTERS, 
10,000 EMAILS IN A DAY OR 70 
CONFRONTS YOU IN A HALLWAY THAT 
PASSIONATELY OR SOMEBODY SHARES 
A MESSAGE THAT SINCE HOME WITH 
YOU, THAT MATTERS. 
THAT SITS WITH YOU IN A 
COMMITTEE HEARING AND WHEN YOU 
ARE VOTING ON THE FLOOR. 
I THINK THAT CITIZEN ACTION AND 
PROGRESS RIGHT THERE THAT WE 
CANNOT IGNORE. 
>> THE UNDERCURRENT THERE AND 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT IS THIS 
AWAKENING ON THE ISSUE OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE NERVE IT 
HITS IN THE TONE AND 
CONVERSATION AND HITTING 
FREQUENCY WITH WOMEN -- 
>> IF IT IS AN AWAKENING, SO 
MANY WOMEN HAVE ASKED ME, IF HE 
MAKES IT ONTO THE COURT, WHAT 
DOES IT SAY TO US THAT YOU 
STILL DO NOT BELIEVE IS? 
THERE IS NO SOLID PROOF. 
THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE. 
WE DO NOT HAVE SOLID PROOF OVER 
WHOSE TESTIMONY TO BELIEVE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THAT IS THE PUSHBACK. 
WE SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMING THAT 
HE IS GUILTY OF A LOT OF 
REPUBLICAN WOMEN ARE LIKE, WAIT 
A MINUTE, THERE ARE TWO SIDES 
AND HE DESERVES A FAIR HEARING 
BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT IT WAS 
NECESSARILY FAIR. 
I THINK THEY WERE BOTH VERY 
COMPELLING. 
THAT IS THE QUESTION. 
IT IS NOT LINING UP IN TERMS OF 
HOW PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO IT. 
SOME PEOPLE ARE HAVING A 
VISCERAL REACTION BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING 
THEMSELVES AND IT'S PERSONAL TO 
THEM. 
IT SPEAKS TO THAT FREQUENCY DR. 
FORD IS TALKING TO BUT OTHER 
WOMEN MAY SAY, BOYS WILL BE 
BOYS OR MEN AND THEY DISMISS IT 
AND THIS IS NOT HAVE THAT 
SEVERITY. 
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE 
TRUTH. 
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND 
LEADERS HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE 
MOMENT OF INTENSITY TO MAKE THE 
RIGHT DECISION. 
THAT IS WHY RUSHING THIS IS A 
DETRIMENTAL THING FOR THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY TO PUSH IT 
THROUGH. 
IT WILL SHOW THAT POINT. 
WE DID NOT LISTEN. 
WE DID NOT CARE. 
SHE IS WRONG. 
SHE IS MISINFORMED. 
THAT IS COUNTING OF ANY WOMAN 
OR ANY VOTER HAS MAJOR, MAJOR 
IMPACT. 
>> I AGREE WITH THAT 
COMPLETELY. 
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE 
GET CAUGHT UP IN STRONGMAN 
ARGUMENTS. 
IT SEEMS TO ME TALKING TO 
FEMALE FRIENDS, GENERALLY 
SPEAKING, WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
CALLING FOR HIS ALLEGATIONS TO 
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY 
ARISE. 
IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO GO 
AHEAD AND CONFIRM SOMEONE 
WITHOUT EVEN PAUSING FOR A WEEK 
WHICH IS WHAT SENATOR FLAKE IS 
CALLING FOR, THAT SEEMS TO BE 
EMBLEMATIC OF A LACK OF TAKING 
THE ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. 
IT IS ONLY A MINORITY OF PEOPLE 
THAT ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE 
SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING, IT IS 
AUTOMATICALLY TRUE, BUT LET'S 
HAVE A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION 
INTO IF CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS 
ARE TRUE. 
I WANT TO WEIGH IN THAT AMY 
KLOBUCHAR SPOKE AFTER THE 
DRAMATIC TURN BY SENATOR FLAKE. 
>> IT IS SIMPLY DECEMBER FLAKE 
WORKING WITH ALL OF US TO SAY 
FOR THE GOOD OF THE SENATE AND 
THE GOOD OF THE COURT, THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE 
THE FACTS FOLLOWED UP ON, AND I 
REALLY APPRECIATE HIS 
WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT AND THAT 
IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. 
THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT -- AND BY 
THE WAY, IF SENATOR McCONNELL 
WANTS TO GO FORWARD IN LIGHT OF 
THAT AND WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL 
SENATORS THAT HAVE NOT SAID HOW 
THEY'RE VOTING ON THIS NOMINEE, 
I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT 
WHAT JUST HAPPENED RIGHT NOW. 
CX SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR 
WEIGHING IN AND THERE WAS A 
DRAMATIC MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE 
TALKING ABOUT DRINKING. 
>> YES. 
AND AMY KLOBUCHAR, THE WOMAN -- 
SENATOR WAS THAT HER FATHER WAS 
AN ALCOHOLIC AND SHE WAS ASKING 
HIM ABOUT DRINKING ANY TURN THE 
TABLE BACK AT HER AND SAID I 
DON'T KNOW. 
HAVE YOU EVER HAD TOO MUCH TO 
DRINK? 
HAVE YOU EVER BLACKED OUT? 
IT WAS COMPLETELY INSENSITIVE 
AND WHAT WAS REMARKABLE IS THAT 
WE NOTICE THE WOMAN BEHIND 
BRETT, KIND OF SLIPPED HIM A 
PAPER AND THEN THEY TOOK A 
BREAK AND THEN HE CAME BACK AND 
HE ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED TO HER 
BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT, AS 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SENATE 
RELATIONSHIPS AND HOW THE 
SENATE AS OF YESTERDAY JUST 
SEEMED TO STOOP TO A LEVEL THAT 
EVERYBODY WAS UNCOMFORTABLE 
WITH AT THE TIME AFTER WATCHING 
THAT HEARING. TODAY I THINK IT 
SHOWS THAT SOME OF THESE 
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SENATE DO 
MATTER. 
AND ALSO JEFF FLAKE, THE REASON 
THAT WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON FLAKE 
IS TALKING ABOUT FLAKE IS THAT 
HE IS RETIRING. 
HE IS A TOP CRITIC OF THE 
PRESIDENT AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT 
HE HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT OF A 
PARIAH IN HIS OWN PARTY. 
HE WAS NOT GOING TO RUN FOR 
REELECTION BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR 
THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO 
SURVIVE A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN 
HIS OWN STATE SO HE IS FULLY 
AWARE OF THE POLITICS HERE AND 
HE HAS NO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. 
INSTEAD, IT IS A COMBATIVE ONE. 
YOU HEARD CHRIS TALK ABOUT HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH JEFF FLAKE. 
HE IS VERY WELL-LIKED AMONG 
REPUBLICANS EVEN THOUGH HE IS A 
DEMOCRAT SO WE ARE STARTING TO 
SEE THE COMMITTEE TRYING TO GET 
TO SOME KIND OF SOLUTION. 
WE WILL SEE HOW LONG THAT LASTS 
BUT CERTAINLY A DIFFERENCE FROM 
YESTERDAY AS FAR AS RIGHT NOW AT
>> TWO OTHER THINGS JUMP OUT. 
IT IS HARD TO LOOK AT JEFF LIKE 
AND NOT THINK ABOUT JOHN McCAIN 
AND CARING THAT LEGACY AND I 
WONDER HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS 
WITH HIM AS HE WAS REACHING FOR 
THAT MOMENT AND REALLY STANDING 
FOR THE INSTITUTION AND 
STANDING FOR INDEPENDENCE IN 
TERMS OF DECIDING THINGS LIKE 
JUDICIAL NOMINEES AND THINGS 
LIKE THAT. 
WE KNOW THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO 
JOHN McCAIN SO I HAVE TO WONDER 
HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS IN JEFF 
FLAKE'S MINE. 
ANOTHER THING. 
I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE GANG OF 
FOUR THAT WE FEEL LIKE HAS 
EMERGED. 
I COME FROM A TIME IN THE 
SENATE WHEN THAT USED TO BE 
VERY COMMON TO HAVE A GANG OF 
EIGHT, A GANG OF 13. 
WHEN I STARTED WORKING THE 
SENATE IN 2005, IT WAS COMMON 
TO HAVE THESE BIPARTISAN GROUPS 
GET TOGETHER TO INFLUENCE AND 
SWAY LEGISLATION. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A 
BYGONE TIME. 
BUT ABSOLUTELY IT FEELS ALMOST 
LIKE THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK A 
LITTLE BIT. 
PEOPLE TRYING TO RECAPTURE SOME 
OF THAT MOMENT FROM THE PAST. 
>> I AM ALSO CURIOUS. 
WE KNOW MARK JUDGE WROTE A BOOK 
AND A CLOSE FRIEND TO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IF THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION GOES FORWARD 
WHICH WE ARE NOT CLEAR IF IT 
WILL OR NOT IF IT HAS THE 
SUPPORT. 
IF HE WILL APPEAR AND ANSWER 
QUESTIONS AND WHAT THE SCOPE OF 
THIS MIGHT BE. 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> IF HE WOULD ANSWER THEM 
UNDER OATH OR UNDER PENALTY OF 
PERJURY SOMETHING THAT 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN HAMMERING Ãº 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WAS VERY RESISTANT 
TO. 
I THOUGHT SOMEWHAT EVASIVE 
ABOUT DURING THE TESTIMONY. 
THIS IS THE WHOLE DANGER THAT 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. 
TIME IS NOT A FRIEND TO BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IN THIS RESPECT. 
THE LONGER THAT THIS PROCESS IS 
ELONGATED, THEN THE MORE 
OPPORTUNITY THERE IS FOR 
NEGATIVE INFORMATION FOR HIM TO 
EMERGE FROM ACCUSERS TO PERHAPS 
COME FORWARD. 
I DO NOT SEE HOW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH GAINS FROM THIS DELAY 
UNLESS IT ENDS UP WITH A 
COMPLETELY CLEAN BILL OF 
HEALTH. 
BACK WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE 
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU. 
HAS BEEN A MARATHON. 
GRATEFUL TO YOU. 
SO GRATEFUL YOU GUYS WILL BE 
HERE WITH US. 
AS I MENTIONED, THE PRESIDENT 
SAID THAT HE DID FIND DR. 
FORDE'S TESTIMONY CREDIBLE, BUT 
HE ALSO SAID THAT HE HAS NOT 
CONSIDER REPLACING HIS SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE. 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE, IT 
WAS UNCLEAR HOW MUCH HE KNEW 
ABOUT THE SUPPORT FOR SENATOR 
FLAKE'S POSITION. 
CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG 
JOINS US RIGHT NOW. 
I AM CURIOUS WHAT A MORNING IT 
HAS BEEN FOR YOU AND WHAT HAVE 
YOU BEEN HERE? 
HAS THE MESSAGE BURIED 
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING OR HAS 
IT BEEN CONSISTENT?, AND IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT 
EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT 
ACKNOWLEDGED HE WAS AWARE OF 
SOME SORT OF DEVELOPMENT THAT 
INVOLVED JEFF FLAKE, I REALLY 
DO NOT THINK THAT HE KNOWS YET 
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW 
THIS COULD PLAY OUT AND THE 
DECISION THAT HE HAS TO MAKE IN 
THE UPCOMING DAYS. 
HE CONTINUED TO DEFER TO G.O.P. 
SENATORS, SAYING THAT HE TRUSTS 
THEM PICKING THINGS THEY ARE 
GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 
TH FACT IS THAT HE IS THE ONE 
WHO WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER 
TO ORDER THIS INVESTIGATION  SO 
EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
THAT HE WILL RELY ON SENATOR 
GRASSLEY AND MITCH McCONNELL, 
THAT IS A CONVERSATION THAT 
THEY WILL ALL, I EXPECT, HAVE 
VERY SOON AND THEY WILL BE 
COMING TO HIM TO SAY, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, LISTEN, I DO NOT THINK 
THAT WE HAVE THE VOTES ON THE 
FULL SENATE FLOOR NOW THAT JEFF 
FLAKE HAS COME OUT AND I 
IMAGINE THAT SENATOR COLLINS 
AND SENATOR McCLOSKEY ARE WITH 
HIM TO DEMAND THIS 
INVESTIGATION BEFORE THEY MOVE 
FORWARD WITH THE FULL VOTE. 
EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE RIGHT IN 
THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND THAT 
IT MADE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE, I 
AM NOT QUITE SURE THAT HE HAS 
BEEN BRIEFED ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT 
HAS TRANSPIRED AND THAT JEFF 
FLAKE AND OTHERS COULD BE 
CALLING FOR THIS INVESTIGATION. 
IT IS HIS DECISION, EVEN THOUGH 
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT IT IS 
UP TO THE SENATORS. 
HE IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO CALL FOR THAT 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. 
BEFORE THIS DEVELOPMENT, 
THOUGH, THE WHITE HOUSE WAS 
CERTAINLY VERY OPTIMISTIC AND 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY THEY THOUGHT 
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO MAKE IT 
OUT OF COMMITTEE. 
THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT 
ULTIMATELY BRETT KAVANAUGH 
WOULD BE CONFIRMED BUT THIS 
CHANGES THE GAME A LITTLE BIT 
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRATS 
HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR ALL ALONG. 
THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE 
FACTS AS ALL OF THE SENATOR 
MADE THE FINAL VOTE ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR ABOUT THE SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE. 
WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL TRANSPIRE 
FROM THE FBI INVESTIGATION IF 
THERE WILL BE ONE. 
I IMAGINE THAT IF IT IS MADE 
CLEAR BY JEFF FLAKE AND OTHER 
REPUBLICANS, THAT THEY WILL NOT 
VOTE YES WITHOUT AN 
INVESTIGATION BUT THE PRESIDENT 
DOES NOT HAVE MUCH CHOICE BUT 
TO ORDER ONE, I THINK. 
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS SICK, NOTHING SO FAR 
ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT 
BUT BEFORE THIS, THE MOOD WAS 
UPBEAT. 
ABOUT THAT 1:30 PM VOTE. 
I IMAGINE THAT ONCE SOMEBODY 
EXPLAINS TO THE PRESIDENT THE 
SITUATION, WE CAN EXPECT MORE 
FROM HIM AND AS WE HEAR FROM 
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, HE 
APPARENTLY THINKS THAT HE IS 
THE ONE TO DO IT. 
>> THAT WAS A FUNNY MOMENT AND 
IT WAS A GOOD POINT OF 
DISTINCTION THAT YOU MAY THAT 
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT NOT BE 
FULLY BRIEFED ON THIS SO WE 
SHOULD GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF 
ROOM AS TO SEE IF HE WEIGHS IN 
THAT LATER. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU. 
SPAMMING AFTER A BREAK, 
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JOE MANSION
IS ONE OF THE SWING VOTES THAT 
COULD DECIDE IF BRETT KAVANAUGH 
GETS ON THE SUPREME COURT AND 
ALSO FACING A TOUGH REELECTION 
PLATE IN WEST VIRGINIA. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
