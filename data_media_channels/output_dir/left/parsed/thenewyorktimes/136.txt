I know words.
I have the best words.
I’m a cleanliness freak.
I love washing my
hands before I eat.
And you go to a restaurant,
and you wash your hands,
and you sterilize everything,
and the water’s nice and hot.
And then you wash them again.
And then you go to the
table, and you sit down.
And a guy walks out, and
he says, hey, Mr. Trump.
How are you doing?
I’m a fan of yours.
And he sticks out his hand.
And then four or five
other people come out.
And sometimes you’re
not in the mood
to shake hands with
everybody and to say hello
to everybody.
And you really just
don’t want to do it.
But the only good thing is
you tend not to eat as much.
