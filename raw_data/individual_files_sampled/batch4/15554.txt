we're standing in a kid's park in the neighborhood directly adjacent to the Kinder Morgan trans mountain protest site Camp cloud and this park it's being expanded it's being worked on for the kids of the neighborhood but the real shame about this park is that it backs on to a field where just over the hill is camp cloud the protest site and now I'm not saying that they have been violent yet but they have threatened an oak alike scenario towards the police and we know back in 1990 a police officer was shot and killed by Mohawk warriors in Oklahoma in a standoff there and these protesters up the hill have raised that specter when talking about their eviction today that is the real shame is that these people in this community didn't ask for any of this but they're living with the consequences for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun reads we're here today on Burnaby Mountain covering the camp cloud protest camp and I'll be frank with you the hopeful eviction of all of them now to see all of our footage and to help cover the cost of our travel here and to cover the cost of our security garden if you watch our footage you'll see exactly why we need it go to rebel Burnaby calm you
