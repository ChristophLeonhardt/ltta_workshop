TRUMP IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO FIGHT AND WIN. THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE HIS SUPREME COURT PICK SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO IS EN ROUTE TO NORTH KOREA TO PROVE THE ROGUE REGIME IS COMMITTED TO DENUCLEARIZATION. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT? ONE OF OUR FAVORITES, NORTH KOREA TAKES OVER THE WORLD, GORDON CHANG, THANK YOU FOR STAND SO FAR? MIKE POMPEO'S THIRD TRIP TO NORTH KOREA ON THE HEELS OF THE SATELLITE IMAGES WE HAVE SEEN. UP THEIR NUCLEAR FACILITIES? THIS IS A MAKE OR BREAK TRIP FOR TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POLICY. THE TRUMP POLICY IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION KIM JONG UN MADE A DECISION TO GIVE UP HIS WEAPONS BUT WE HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OVER THE LAST WEEK THAT SHOWS NORTH KOREA RACING AHEAD NOT ONLY ON MISSILES SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM THEM TO GIVE UP THEIR NUKES AND MISSILES, DISMANTLE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND PERMIT INSPECTIONS. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMING DOWN ON ITS DEMANDS. DON'T KNOW THAT IS TRUE BUT WE WILL GET A GOOD INDICATION WHEN THIS TRIP IS OVER SO IT IS NOW OR NEVER FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. HEATHER: HE SENT A TWEET SAYING MANY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. IT IS GOING WELL. IN THE MEANTIME NO ROCKET LAUNCHES OR NUCLEAR TESTING IN INCLUDES THE FAKE NEWS IS COMPLAINING. IF NOT FOR ME WE WOULD NOW BE AT I DON'T THINK THERE IS A FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE CLAIM WE WOULD BE AT WAR WERE IT NOT FOR HIM. WITH REGARD TO WHETHER NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING WELL OR NOT WE WILL KNOW BY THE END OF NORTH KOREANS BECAUSE THEY ARE SCHEDULED FOR A DAY AND A HALF, FRIDAY AND SATURDAY LOCAL TIME. I THINK IN SOME SENSE THEY ARE GOING WELL BUT THERE IS CONCERN THEY WOULDN'T BE LEAKING IF THEY THOUGHT THINGS WERE GOING THE WAY THEY WANTED SO THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS AN OBLIGATION TO TALK INTELLIGENCE IS REAL AND NOT JUST FROM LEAKS BUT FROM OBSERVATION OF SATELLITE IMAGERY BY PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THEY'LL POINT IN THE SAME DIRECTION, NORTH KOREA IS RACING AHEAD AND THAT IS TROUBLESOME. IS IT A NEGOTIATION TYPE SURE AND IT COULD BE A NEGOTIATION TACTIC THAT THE NORTH KOREANS ARE RACING AHEAD ON THEIR PROGRAM TO GET IS GOOD A DEAL AS POSSIBLE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION BUT THIS PARTICULAR TIME THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO BACK DOWN AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF AT THE END OF JUNE TALKED ABOUT NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA IS LIKE COOKING TURKEYS, IT IS DONE BETTER OVER A LONG ADMINISTRATION SAID IT WOULDN'T DO AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO STICK TO ITS OWN POSITIONS.
