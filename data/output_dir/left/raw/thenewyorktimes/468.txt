1
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,548
Tip number one is that
less is more.

2
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,288
Steam and iron
the entire bed.

3
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:25,392
Not only the sheets
and the comforter,

4
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,726
but also the pillows.

5
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:26,760
but also the pillows.
Makes it look as fresh 
as it can possibly look.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,397
Makes it look as fresh 
as it can possibly look.

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,202
I love color, but

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,706
it needs to be used
correctly.

9
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,641
Yellow is my go to.

10
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,344
It's sort of like the center of
a flower is yellow.

11
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:47,280
The center of photograph should
also pull you in.

12
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:58,124
Regarding plants, the more
palmy-type plants are

13
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,894
in the lounge area
of the outside space.

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,297
hile the more evergreen and
hearty varieties are closer

15
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,600
to the dining and cooking
areas.

16
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,642
The main living room had a
very high ceiling.

17
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,044
So we wanted to really show the
height of it.

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,979
So the art that we installed

19
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,849
was very vertical and very tall.

20
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:30,924
Allow the viewer to target
and focus on just a few items.

21
00:01:30,924 --> 00:00:00,000
So if something is not exactly
necessary for the shoot, take it away.
