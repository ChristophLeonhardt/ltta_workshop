is it big enough crowd candidates are gonna wish they weren't doing interviews with me remotely they're gonna wish they were out here campaigning but we wouldn't be doing to meet the midterm voters tour of swing states without visiting America's eternal swing state it's Florida it'll be in our tombstone but as we told you earlier polls in the Sunshine State have taken on a blue tint in recent days joining me now from Miami is the Tallahassee mayor and the nominee for the Democratic Party for governor Florida we've got a lot of fans out here Andrew Gilliam hey everybody I was just gonna say it I don't think they're here to see me so I think they were hoping to get a get to see you but let me I'm gonna start off with is there enough down here in the area I grew up in in Richmond Heights I used to play football on this field out here I'm sorry I can't be with you but I'm enjoying being back home I have a feeling I lost football games and Pop Warner on that very field because I remember doing that I was inviting will I've no doubt let me ask you about some news of the day here having to do with this FBI investigation and the fact that there is now some text messages that indicate this issue of who paid for these Hamilton tickets and did you ever pay for these tickets or were these freebies can you clear this up once and for all well yeah I mean so today's news was no news for us at all I always knew that if we were able to connect at New York we would go and see Hamilton when I got to the theater my brother handed me the ticket the idea that I accepted a gift never came to me what I've tried to do throughout this whole process is be as open and transparent as I possibly can be I understand that my opponent is attempting as best he can to muddy the waters here and again I'm sorry that he doesn't have a plan for the state of Florida and therefore has worked extremely hard to distract but I think what Florida voters need to know about me is that for 15 years I've served honorably expect respectably and have served my community without so much as a stain on my record or on my name until I decided to run for governor but that's okay we're gonna push through it and we're gonna win this race how would you have handled this differently well it's a good question I think in hindsight obviously you would be much more circumspect about anybody who comes around you I never frankly feared for people coming into my space because I never assumed people to have negative or ill intentions toward me that never been the case really up to this point and if I had to do it again I would have been a lot more circumspect about the people that I allowed to be around me and they come into my space but you know what you live and you learn and you move on I've had the opportunity to grow from it learn from it and move on and is there any other because I'll tell you we actually we canvassed the crowd they came up with a bunch of great questions but one of them was this issue that there's concern from your supporters out here that this FBI investigation could become a problem at the polls can you assure them there's nothing else out there yeah I mean there's absolutely nothing out there that would in any way suggest that I've done anything illegal or earnt toward my opponent will continue to spread you know lies quite frankly every one of its ads as it relates to me have all been considered and called false Yeti continues to air them in my opinion the one thing test that you have to pass with Florida voters they just you act you got to be able to tell the truth and in my case that's what I've tried to do it every step of the way in DeSantis this case he is spread lie after lie after lie and in my opinion that disqualifies him from the office my grandmother always used to say if you tell the truth you don't have to worry about covering up for lies I've told the truth consistently today's text messages and other releases by mr. Kouri only substantiate exactly what I've said up to this point I stand by it and I'll continue to stand by the truth so long as I'm breathing let's move on to some other questions some other parts of the campaign you ended up you would governor Scott he's running in another race but you you you and him ended up talking almost every day I take it during the aftermath of hurricane Michael how would you assess the state's response what have you taken away from it if you're elected governor are there some things that you would do similarly now there's some things you would do differently yeah you know one of the I think hallmark traditions of people here in Florida certainly people who run for elected office statewide is that when a storm approaches and when a storm comes and when our people are in any danger we suspend with negative attacks and and quite frankly try to work more closely together in this case that's what Governor Scott and I attempted to do we did talk on a daily basis in the lead-up and through and in the aftermath of the storm I appreciated his willingness to I think subside with politics as I did I took my ads off the air even though they were positive ads in that part of the state he took his ads off the air senator Nelson took his ads off the air my opponent doubled down with his ads negative ads as people were trying to flee a category for denier category 5 hurricane he kept his negative ads up that were untrue and quite frankly I thought he had a moment to show leadership and quite frankly to show a little bit of bipartisanship that in times of trouble and times of natural disaster we come together a number of us chose to do that senator Nelson Governor Skye myself my opponent chose the exact opposite course I want to ask you speaking of some nastiness out there and we're gonna play some of these but there's some pretty nasty Robo radio ads and some audio some phone calls that are out very very racist in its intention some gross stereotypes look races popping up in this campaign the first time you and I talked on air on the day you were the nominee the issue of race popped up with with a phrase that your opponent had used what would you like to see there the Republican Party is distance itself from this in fact they've all been ounce this ad is there more do you think the Republican already can do to help eradicate this style of politicking well I have to tell you leadership starts at the top when mr. DeSantis became his party's nominee he went on fox news and told people not to monkey up the state by electing me a phrase that I've it's not commonly used so far as I know certainly not amongst any of the circles that I'm in and and and and quite frankly I think people are taking their cues there what I think they ought to do is quite frankly stop the dog whistles stop the bull horns the attacks on me the false ads that are being running are all intended to quite frankly further a stereotype about black men illegal unethical take things for free monkey it up jungle animals I mean those kinds of things it's not hard to understand why neo-nazis would take an extension of that and then take it to the next level of extremity what I think they're doing however is they're grossly under estimating and miss estimating the people of this state the people of Florida are going to dismiss they're going to in fact reject that brand of divisive destructive rhetoric we're one of the most richly diverse states in all of America we're going to show them on November 6 that they have played their hand the wrong way we're going to do do you think that's why we've had two polls in a row let's have shown you up substantially frankly well I lead that I don't believe and I you know it's a it's a surprising lead do you think you're that far ahead elicits you don't want to ask me about polls there wasn't a single poll showing me winning the Democratic nomination at all even the day before the election I think the poll had me seven points behind my closest opponent as I've told a lot of supporters forget the polls the only poll that matters is Election Day November 6 early voting has already started in this state and I'm encouraging everybody to get out there and vote when we vote we win when our voters organize and get out there and vote we win and so forget the polls I don't care about them I want people to get out there and let their voices be heard at the ballot box that's how we're going to win this race Andrew Gilliam mayor of Tallahassee Democratic nominee for governor thanks for coming on sharing your views they're even saying bring it home thanks to have your message has gotten fruit of these we get home yeah thanks for coming on I much appreciate it hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
