forecasting in a really nice pictorial

9
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,470
fashion and I also loved Christina

Horner's videos of things i'm into for

11

October the Casual Vacancy by JK<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rowling</font>

17
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,410
of course that book technically came out

18
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,480
at the end of sep tember but me and

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,309
everyone I know has taken quite a while

20
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,530
to read it just savoring it and savoring

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,149
the luxury of not having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rush through</font>

22
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,980
it find out what happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harry the</font>

23
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,930
Casual Vacancy the story told in many

24
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,760
parts with multiple narratives it said

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,170
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fictional town of pagford which</font>

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,940
is in the West Country narration flicks

27
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,980
between people of varying social status

28
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,390
within this town characters such as

29
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,280
crystal who lives on an estate and

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Samantha who lives in a very</font>

who<font color="#CCCCCC"> lives with her husband and her</font>

35
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,970
daughters and the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> is told from a</font>

36
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,320
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other perspectives as well</font>

37
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,490
there's the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to note about</font>

38
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,500
this book it feels extremely populated

39
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,909
my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about JK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowling's</font>

40
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,260
writing has probably always been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

41
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">dialogue I think she's amazing at</font>

42
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,830
writing dialogue she's so funny but not

43
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a forced way and I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love love</font>

44
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,790
love love reading her dialogue this book

45
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,290
is full of dialogue but it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

46
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions about the significance of</font>

47
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,520
local council council elections and the

48
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,770
relationship between people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

49
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,170
supposing ruling parties whether the

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are in control of certain</font>

51
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,259
decisions are really the right people

52
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,520
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that job and have the understanding</font>

53
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,200
of the people that they are making

<font color="#E5E5E5">decisions to affect the delightful</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">genoise at the Daily Mail called it a</font>

56
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,340
500-page socialist manifesto I can

57
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine her saying that scathingly and a</font>

58

a long cigarette holder<font color="#CCCCCC"> what do you</font>

60
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a socialist manifesto is a good or</font>

61
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,590
a bad thing for a book to become

62
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,210
personally I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the worst</font>

63
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that it could be the Casual</font>

64
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,030
Vacancy calls into question how we

65
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,040
interact one another and why that

66
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
matters why we have to see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

67
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,790
farther than our echo chambers there was

68
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,560
a certain pleasure in reading books that

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
someone had just clearly enjoyed writing

70
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,098
so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the best book I've read this</font>

71
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,300
year and I wouldn't rave about a

72
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,679
different Street to Street but that's

73
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,480
not to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was in any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

74
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,220
average or bad so that's where I felt

75
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,019
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Casual Vacancy by JK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowling it is</font>

76
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,390
strictly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my going up list the second</font>

email by a company called<font color="#CCCCCC"> caseville who</font>

79
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,549
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> me whether i could review one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I was at first a little bit like</font>

82
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,620
skeptical because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't like</font>

83
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,209
to do product placement stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

84
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:31,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything it seems like product business</font>

85
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I'd give it a shot</font>

86
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,010
and be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> transparent about the fact</font>

87
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,900
that they sent this to me but it was

88
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,760
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a that took place that</font>

89
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,260
they sent me and you can pick from like

90
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,670
some of the artists designs on the

91
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,409
website and so I picked this one because

92
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:44,730
i thought was beautiful and it's really

93
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">durable and I like it a lot it's</font>

97
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,150
by going up for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> month is related to</font>

the gossip<font color="#E5E5E5"> girl video that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I posted the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">other week now I got a couple of</font>

100
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,079
comments and have received<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of</font>

comments over the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months from</font>

102
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,379
people saying I should watch Pretty

103
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,030
Little Liars I have a confession to make

104
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,010
I have watched 40 episodes of pretty

105
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,840
little liars over the past fortnight it

106
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,010
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only recently that preceded our</font>

107
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,500
lives came out on DVD in the UK and it's

108
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,629
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's just so addictive but</font>

109
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's also not terrible every time I</font>

110
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,870
watch an episode of Pretty Little Liars

111
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,370
I'm just amazed that they've maintained

112
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,959
this thriller feeling of it and even

113
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,030
though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fundamentally disagree</font>

114
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,260
with some of the things on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this program</font>

115
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">aria and Ezra for example even though</font>

116
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,000
Ezra is beautiful in so many ways it's a

117
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,889
story that's just told really well I

118
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,630
suppose we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say am i watching it</font>

119
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,090
for the writing writing research that's

120
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,150
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watched 40 episodes of it i will</font>

121
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,190
see you on Wednesday for be going down

122
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,930
