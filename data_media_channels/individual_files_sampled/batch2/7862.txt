look another call it has been a called for Chris Papas we were sort of just waiting to see how long they would wait they waited until 23% reporting but he still has a 30 point lead and so it was extremely unlikely and apparently impossible at this point the more Sullivan was going to catch up okay so a mixed bag so far in New Hampshire okay a couple more comments here by the way John's wearing a shirt from the last Drive that we did and so we don't make this anymore I know this such creatures and again drawn up by one of our viewers yeah did you see the drawing that whatever viewers sent in today I said so there's a great draw will show it to you guys on another day maybe tomorrow night when we do Rhode Island because everybody I think it looks great with two notable exceptions giant roller for some reason looks like Barack Obama I do look a little bit like Barack Obama yeah and people have said from time to time yeah I get one as ever said yeah yeah Trump asked me for my Bursar's every once and I was like that's not me and one of the hosts was driven or this is a person who's off on air was drawn as a monkey yeah that's a good one yes but it's not really nailed like I thought jr. looked just like jr. will show it at some point yeah yeah yeah yeah let's try to do tomorrow all right speaking of the members couple comments here for the member section finally is shock now writes in finally able to watch live I found TYT from a clip of Anna on CNN I watched a couple episodes after that and joined within the week that was almost two years ago and I've never looked back thank you appreciate it we stole one from CNN okay so that happens sometimes Connor writes and watch CYT for a long time it took me from a teenage conservative to a 21 year old progressive just became a member to show my support I would love to see rebel headquarters ask the candidates what they have on about disabled rights okay very good boy you're important by the way tonight we're gonna do a post here for the members to after the election coverage is over so Michael sure might be the clock on that one and one of the things we're gonna discuss is why am i named you gir you got the you Gers in China being impress right now mm-hmm and I want to go back to the Serena Williams story kiss one part of the reaction to our video there I hit one of my pet peeves and kind of enraged me so I wanted to go back to that in fact I wanted to break my racket over how mad I was if you do I'm gonna draw a picture of you okay yeah yeah the pictures are just terrible okay so of course TYT complex join to become a member so John there it is and it's got hey what have you guys asked earlier about having home progressives logo and there it is it's don't show receive I think it's good yes I am working on that okay so I let me read a comment from a New Hampshire voter who's a member okay Sean Laurie chandlery sorry wrote in New Hampshire voter here I voted for Chris Pappas today solely to defeat more o'sullivan fascinating I would have liked to vote for another candidate but Sullivan came here was tremendous out-of-state money and a record of not voting in midterm elections she's not my choice at all on a separate note shanks rant on northeast voting for Republican governors last week really struck a nerve we're gonna need a massive blue wave to oust Sununu come on guys stop voting for Republicans in the Northeast so look at what happened with the other Sununu john sununu oh I'm a moderate from New Hampshire I'm an old-school Republican I'm reasonable and then went on to be same and do monstrous things at the federal level for a while even at the federal level he appeared moderate but as time went on and the right-wing party got crazy and crazier it turns out soon it was crazy all along and he's like Oh finally I have permission Yeah right so he'd go on CNN and say outrageous things even before Trump yeah yeah so I want to say something about that what you were just talking about about the the voter was saying about the coming in with the huge outside money I think it was like I think she raised one point eight five million dollars for the primary it's just crazy money insane money imagine the good you could do in the district if you spent it on people in the district rather than trying to represent the district but that's what they do and I also saw we showed a graph on the damage report this morning of independent expenditures in support of Ted Cruz going back to the very beginning of this year and in total it counts a million dollars which I'm sure is a massive undercounting but it starts at like if the charts here it starts at the bottom and like month by month by month by month by month go by until like two weeks ago who shoots up and we know why Beto Rourke down now only one by one point in the most recent poll and it just seems weird that you can just flood the race with money that has absolutely nothing to do with Texas I get that that's in our system you're allowed to do that and in some cases it can be done in a positive way like we encourage you to support other candidates I guess in some way that's the same thing you know although these are not coming from individuals obviously but the fact that like what if he wins because some PACs headquartered in DC flooded you know two three million dollars in the last weeks of the race what do you mean what if that's how most of them because they despise him even more like you finally have a Democrat in striking distance of winning a Senate seat in Texas and he might be saved by this outside money yeah it's devastating look or he's just like drink look he started at the bottom and now he's here yeah you think that all of a sudden and a lot of small donors from Texas who were conservatives got worked up and they're like you know what I think this is the time to give money to beta okay so I'm gonna rush out there give money goes no it's millionaires billionaires corporations coming in and going Oh Ted Cruz will give us everything we want I would remember how Trump humiliated him and and then he begged Trump for his endorsement and you know and look Ted Cruz is a perfect example of what at least politicians will do for donors you remember this story that Cruz does not endorse Trump during the RNC and it's a big controversial move and I was like hey you know what here's a guy who I can't stand at all but a little bit of respect here for having the balls to go into the convention give a speech where he doesn't endorse the candidate because the candidate is too monstrous and had said terrible things about his wife is that etc so he then goes upstairs in the convention I where they have the Suites where the donors are and he goes to his top donor the Mercer's Robert and Rebecca Mercer in the primaries they had given him thirteen million dollars when he gets to the suite they open the door and then slam it in his face because they had switched and now we're backing Trump after that happens to Ted Cruz mr. tough guy will not endorse starts phone-banking for Trump because he's a bitch for leagues okay and so that is what donors get him to do so that's why all that donor money is flooding into Cruz now they're like he'll do anything we could spit in his wife's face slap his dad across the face and he'll still serve us that's why that there it is and that's the donor money flooding into Ted Cruz because he is their servant they found a nice little servant in Ted Cruz and and that's why the money's coming in and and they realized uh-oh Beto might win last thing about the donors in this regard the more osullivan fact that John gave you one point eight five million dollars spent in the primaries okay why do you have to find a more conservative person to put into a primary against progressives and Papas which is you know moderate progressive right remember the talking point a use against progressives for years decades don't do primaries don't you primaries against our establishment incumbent Democrats because they waste money you need to save the money for the general election what do you guys doing wasting money in primaries that hurts the party and all of a sudden when there's progressives in the race they don't mind wasting money in the primaries at all two million dollars it's almost as if the establishment Democrats had been lying through their teeth the entire time yeah almost by the way well at least today an ain't good you know backing up our member who wrote that in thank you very much for wasting two million dollars of establishment money yeah you just flushed that down the toilet sad day for you too easy wasteful Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're
