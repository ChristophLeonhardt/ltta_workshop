>>LATE LAST NIGHT DONALD TRUMP
ANNOUNCED HE WOULD BE MAKING A
SIGNIFICANT AND MORE THAN LIKELY
DISASTROUS CHANGE TO THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH HE PUT
OUT A PRESS RELEASE FOR AND THEN
DID, THE PRESS RELEASE READ IN
PART --
>>IF YOU AREN'T SURE WHAT THAT
MEANS BECAUSE IT'S WEIRD SPEAK,
THERE ARE THESE IMPORTANT
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THAT GO TO
MAKE SURE THE LOWEST INCOME
AMERICANS CAN MAKE SURE TO
AFFORD THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE,
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WILL
NOW APPARENTLY COME OUT --
>>WE WILL BREAK DOWN ALL THE
REASONS THAT CUTTING OUT THESE
SUBSIDIES IS DISASTROUS, WHY
IT'S INTENTIONALLY DISASTROUS,
BUT IMMEDIATELY AT THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES
FINALIZED THEIR PREMIUMS FOR THE
UPCOMING YEAR IN LATE SEPTEMBER.
SOME OF THEM THANKFULLY BECAUSE
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH
UNCERTAINTY THIS YEAR ABOUT
WHETHER THOSE SUBSIDIES WOULD
VANISH FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT,
A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVE COME UP
WITH TWO SETS OF POTENTIAL
PREMIUMS BASED ON THE SUBSIDIES
EXISTING OR NOT, WHICH MEANS
THEORETICALLY THEY MIGHT HAVE
MADE SOME MOVES THAT WOULD
MITIGATE SOME OF THE DAMAGE IN
THE RISE IN PREMIUMS, BUT AT
LEAST 14 MAJOR INSURANCE
COMPANIES DIDN'T DO THAT, WHICH
MEANS NOW YOU AREN'T JUST GOING
TO HAVE A RISE IN YOUR PREMIUMS
AS A RESULT OF THIS IF YOU ARE
IN THAT CSR CATEGORY, YOU WILL
HAVE A DRASTIC, SIGNIFICANT RISE
AS THEY SCRAMBLE TO MAKE ENDS
MEET NOW THAT THIS MOVE HAS BEEN
ANNOUNCED.
>>HE DID A TRIFECTA OF DAMAGE,
WHICH I GUESS IS NORMAL FOR
TRUMP, AND PART OF THIS, I HAVE
TO BE HONEST, I LIKE TO CLARIFY,
DIVE IN AND TRY TO MAKE IT
SIMPLE, BUT I READ ABOUT EIGHT
ARTICLES AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW HE PULLED THIS OFF.
YOUR
PRICES WILL GENERALLY GO UP 20
OR 25%, 20% NOW, AS JOHN POINTED
OUT IT'S MONTH-TO-MONTH, IT
MIGHT BE NEXT MONTH THAT YOUR
PRICES GO UP DEPENDING ON IF IT
GOT BAKED INTO THE PRICE OR NOT.
BY THE WAY LET ME PAUSE FOR A
SECOND, THAT'S AN IMPORTANT
POINT, YOU WERE MAD AT OBAMACARE
BECAUSE THE PRICES KEPT GOING
UP?
PART OF IT WAS BECAUSE THEY
ALREADY INCREASED THE PRICES
BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S EARLIER
THREATS THAT HE WOULD DO THIS.
OBAMACARE, THE PRICES ARE UP --
BY THE WAY SOME OF THAT IS
MERITED, BUT THE OTHER PART WAS
BECAUSE TRUMP SAID I WILL
DESTROY OBAMACARE, THIS IS HOW,
YOU WILL NEED TO INCREASE
PRICES, THEY BAKED THAT IN, SO
GO AHEAD AND PREEMPTIVELY
GET ANGRY AT TRUMP, OR GET ANGRY
IN HINDSIGHT.
>>POST-EMPTIVELY.
>>TO MAKE UP A WORD THAT TRUMP
WOULD ENJOY/NOT UNDERSTAND.
>>THEN CLAIM HE INVENTED.
>>TO THE HEART OF IT, THE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HE SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO INCREASE YOUR PRICES
BY 20% AND INCREASE THE DEFICIT
BY $200 BILLION.
HOW IS THAT
POSSIBLE?
I KEPT READING IT AND
REREADING IT, BUT HE'S A
MAGICIAN.
IF YOU NEED SOMETHING
SCREWED UP ROYALLY, YOU BRING IN
DONALD TRUMP AND HE WILL FIND A
WAY TO DO THAT.
>>BECAUSE NOW THAT MONEY WILL
HAVE TO BE PAID OUT OF THE
FEDS, IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING?
>>BUT YOUR PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP
ANYWAY.
THE GOVERNMENT WAS
HELPING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES,
NOT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO, BUT
BECAUSE THAT WAS TO OFFSET THE
COST FOR REALLY POOR PEOPLE WHO
HAVE THIS, AND THIS AFFECTS POOR
PEOPLE MORE THAN MIDDLE-CLASS,
REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE, YES, WHO
CARES ABOUT POOR PEOPLE?
ONCE
THAT MONEY IS TAKEN AWAY
INSURANCE COMPANIES GO OKAY,
SINCE THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE
AFTER INCREASE YOUR PREMIUMS,
THAT PART I UNDERSTAND.
>>THE REASON IT INCREASES THE
DEFICIT IS HOW IT WORKS NOW IS
YOU RECEIVE THIS MONEY FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD
LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS, AND OTHER
PREMIUMS WILL BE HIGHER BUT
THERE'S ALREADY A STIPULATION
THAT YOU CAN DEDUCT FROM YOUR
TAXES SOME OF THESE PREMIUMS YOU
PAY, SINCE YOU WILL BE PAYING
MORE, THAT MEANS YOU'LL BE
PAYING LESS IN TAXES
SPECIFICALLY, YOU WILL STILL BE
PAYING MUCH MORE OVERALL, SO THE
GOVERNMENT WILL LOSE OUT ON THAT
MONEY THEY WOULD'VE OTHERWISE
GOTTEN IN TAXES.
THE TAX CREDITS
DO IT.
FOR ALL WE KNOW MAYBE HE
WILL ELIMINATE THOSE AS WELL, HE
SEEMS DEAD SET ON SCREWING OVER
HIS VOTERS.
>>THE TRIFECTA PART, THE LAST
PART, NOW THE MARKETS ARE WAY
MORE UNSTABLE FOR HEALTH
INSURANCE.
SOME OF THOSE
INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT IN
THEIR MIND WEREN'T MAKING ENOUGH
MONEY, NOW THEY WILL MAKE EVEN
LESS, THEIR MERCHANTS WILL BE
SMALLER, AND THEY MIGHT GO I'M
JUST NOT GOING TO PROVIDE
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE,
WHICH THEN LIMITS YOUR CHOICES
AND SCREWS YOU OVER EVEN
FURTHER, AND DESTABILIZES THE
WHOLE THING, AND THEN HE WILL
TURN AROUND AND GO SEE THAT?
OBAMACARE IS IMPLODING.
YOU MADE
IT IMPLODE.
IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE
WAY OF DOING UNTOLD DAMAGE IN
SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS, AND BY
THE WAY LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT DOES
IT HELP?
NOTHING!
NOTHING.
>>IT ONLY HELPS UNDO THE OBAMA
LEGACY.
>>YES.
IN TERMS OF HOW DOES IT
HELP YOU WITH YOUR INSURANCE,
THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE A CLAIM,
THEY CAN'T WITH A STRAIGHT FACE
SAY IT WILL LOWER PREMIUMS OR
GIVE YOU MORE BENEFITS OR ANY OF
THE THINGS THEY PROMISED, THEY
DON'T EVEN MAKE THAT CLAIM.
THE
ONLY THING THEY SAY IS WE ARE
DESTROYING OBAMACARE, THAT'S IT.
>>I WISH WE COULD DO THE ENTIRE
HOUR ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO
IMPORTANT, YOU ALLUDED TO THIS
BUT WHEN I POSTED THAT THIS WAS
GOING TO LEAD TO INCREASED
PREMIUMS SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS
WHO REFUSE TO REALIZE THAT
THEY'VE BEEN HOODWINKED AND
SCREWED OVER RESPOND WITH
PREMIUMS HAVE BEEN GOING UP.
YES, THEY HAVE, BUT YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN
THE NATURAL GROWTH IN PREMIUMS
FROM OUR EFFED-UP HEALTHCARE
SYSTEM ON ONE HAND, AND THE
POLITICIAN YOU SUPPORT
INTENTIONALLY RAISING YOUR
PREMIUMS WITH THE STROKE OF THE
PEN.
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS,
ONE DOESN'T SEEM QUITE AS
NECESSARY HONESTLY.
OVERALL IT
IS EXPECTED THAT AT LEAST 1
MILLION PEOPLE WILL GO OFF OF
INSURANCE AS A RESULT OF THIS.
AND REALLY FAST, BECAUSE WE
TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER, IT'S
NOT THE ONLY CHANGE THAT CAME TO
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THIS
WEEK ALONE, THERE WERE OTHER
CHANGES A DAY AGO, WHEN WE SAY
THAT THIS WILL INCREASE YOUR
PREMIUMS BY 20% WE DON'T MEAN
THEY WILL ONLY GO UP TWENTY
PERCENT FROM ALL THE STUFF THAT
IS HAPPENING, WE MEAN THIS ONE
WILL RAISE IT BY 20%.
THE
LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YESTERDAY'S
CHANGE, WHICH WILL TAKE HEALTHY
PEOPLE OUT OF THE POOL AND RAISE
THE COST OVERALL FOR OTHER
PEOPLE, THAT'S A SEPARATE
INCREASE TO YOUR PREMIUMS
THAT WILL HAPPEN.
SO GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT YOUR
BILLS WILL LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR.
>>THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME, I
FORGOT THE FOURTH WAY IT
DAMAGES YOU IS THAT 1 MILLION
PEOPLE LOSE INSURANCE.
>>JUST FROM THIS.
MORE PEOPLE WILL LOSE INSURANCE
WHEN THE SYSTEM COLLAPSES
OVERALL, THAT'S JUST FROM THIS.
>>THERE WAS A LOT WRONG WITH
OBAMACARE, IT WAS AN INSURANCE
COMPANY GRAB, INSURANCE
COMPANIES WITH BIG MONEY BEHIND
THEM HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE
WHAT IS HEALTHCARE POLICY IN
THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME SO
EVEN THIS OBAMACARE WHICH
BROUGHT ALL THIS INSURANCE TO
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, AND THOSE
PEOPLE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE
WERE PROVIDED WITH THESE
SUPPLEMENTS, THOSE SUPPLEMENTS
ARE NOW GOING AWAY, IT WAS A
FLAWED POLICY BUT TRUMP HAS
TAKEN THIS FLAWED POLICY AND
REALLY TORCHED IT IN A WAY SO AS
TO TAKE -- AS I SAY TAKE
SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY FLAWED
AND TURN IT ON ITS SIDE SO IT
DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO SUSTAIN
ITSELF IN ANY WAY, AND WE WILL
GET TO A COUPLE OTHER ASPECTS
WHERE THE LAW FALLS SHORT NOW.
>>ONE QUICK THING ABOUT THAT,
THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT OUR
SITE IS HONEST SO WE WILL TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THE FLAWS OF
OBAMACARE, WE WILL TOUCH ON THAT
MORE, THEIR SITE IS NOT HONEST.
THEIR PROPOSALS WHICH ARE
DISASTROUS, THEY SAY IT'S
WONDERFUL, IT'S THE BEST THING
YOU WILL EVER HAVE, YOU LOSING
YOUR INSURANCE IS WONDERFUL,
PREMIUMS GOING UP BY 25% IS
GREAT FOR YOU.
THEY DON'T
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY PART OF IT AND
LIE OVER AND OVER.
AND WHEN WE
ARE HONEST EVERYONE GOES
EVERYONE ADMITS THAT OBAMACARE
IS BAD BUT ONLY HALF THE PEOPLE
ADMIT TRUMP CARE IS A DISASTER.
THAT'S NOT TRUE, EVERY PROPOSAL
OF TRUMP HAS COST PEOPLE
INSURANCE AND INCREASED PREMIUMS
AT LEAST FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
YOUNG AND HEALTHY.
AND AS I
EXPLAINED YESTERDAY IT'S A TRAP,
THE THING HE DID YESTERDAY, YOU
THINK I GOT BETTER INSURANCE, IT
ONLY LASTS FOR THREE MONTHS, BUT
THE MINUTE YOU GET SICK THEY
DON'T RENEW, THEN YOU HAVE
A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION WHICH
MEANS YOU ARE SCREWED WHICH
MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE.
>>THAT WAS THE BIG THING WITH
OBAMACARE, THE PRE-EXISTING
CONDITIONS CLAUSE WAS HUGE.
I'VE
MET PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES
WERE LITERALLY SAVED BY THAT ONE
FACT, THAT PRE-EXISTING -- THIS
IS THE BEGINNING OF AN
UNRAVELING THAT COULD AFFECT
LIVES, NOT THAT TRUMP HAS EVER
MET OR WILL EVER MEET ANY
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE
AFFECTED.
>>ONE MORE THING ABOUT THE
REPUBLICANS IS THAT THEY KNOW
HOW BAD IT IS, THEY AREN'T
SAYING IT PUBLICLY, BUT THE
NOTED CONCERN FOR REPUBLICANS IN
CONGRESS FOR THE 2018 ELECTIONS,
WHY WOULD YOU BE CONCERNED IF
YOUR PLAN IS BETTER AND IT
BROUGHT PEOPLE LOWER INSURANCE
AND BETTER BENEFITS LIKE YOU
PRETENDED?
WHY WOULD YOU BE CONCERNED?
THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT HE DID
IT THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE
ORDER AND NOT THROUGH CONGRESS
THAT IT MIGHT LOSE THEM SEATS,
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SEATS
BECAUSE THE PLAN IS WAY WORSE.
>>IT'S NOT LIKE IF IT HAD BEEN
THE RESULT OF A BILLET SOMEONE
LOST THEIR HOUSE, AT LEAST IT
WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.
I WANT
TO BRING THIS UP, JUST THIS ONE
CHANGE, THE EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE
ON PEOPLE'S LIVES, THIS IS
BEFORE THIS CHANGE --
>>I WANT TO 
LOOK AT THAT FIRST
ONE, IF YOU DO SOME QUICK MATH
IN YOUR HEAD YOU WILL SEE THAT
THE CSRs DROPPED THE DEDUCTIBLE,
BUT WHEN YOU ARE BELOW THE
POVERTY LINE THAT ISN'T JUST
$3400 BECAUSE IN MANY CASES YOU
WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY IT WITHOUT
THAT.
IT'S NOT $3400, ITS
BANKRUPTCY AND HOMELESSNESS, IN
MANY CASES IT'S DEATH, IT'S NOT
A DOLLAR VALUE, IT'S A
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE FOR YOUR
FAMILY'S ENTIRE LIFE, AND TO
CALLOUSLY THROW THIS OUT THERE
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF OBAMA'S
LEGACY, TO DESTROY IT WITHOUT
EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING THE
LIVES YOU WILL DESTROY IS
INCREDIBLY CRAVEN EVEN BY
TRUMP'S STANDARDS.
>>FINALLY OBAMACARE'S UPSIDE IS
IT PROTECTED YOU, IF YOU HAD A
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION YOU
WEREN'T GOING TO DIE ANYMORE.
THAT'S A BIG DEAL, AND IF YOU
WERE AROUND THE POVERTY LINE AS
JOHN DESCRIBED, YOU MAKE VERY
LITTLE MONEY, NOW YOU ARE
WORKING POOR, YOU ARE NOT A BUM,
YOU ARE WORKING HARD AND MAKING
MONEY BUT NOT ENOUGH MONEY AND
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT $3400 LYING
AROUND, I THINK THE NUMBER IS
SOMETHING LIKE 75% OF AMERICANS
ARE ONLY $700 AWAY FROM
BANKRUPTCY, THAT'S UNREAL.
>>THAT'S ONE FOURTH OF THE
DIFFERENCE IN YOUR DEDUCTIBLE.
>>THAT'S WHAT I KEEP TRYING TO
EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE IN POWER, THEY
DON'T HAVE THOSE PROBLEMS, THEY
CAN'T UNDERSTAND THOSE PROBLEMS,
THEY LITERALLY DON'T BELIEVE
THOSE PROBLEMS, THEN THEY WONDER
WHY PEOPLE ARE ANGRY.
SO TRUMP
IS PLAYING WITH YOUR LIVES, BUT
AS GOOD AS THOSE PROVISIONS IN
OBAMACARE ARE, MY GOD, DID THEY
MAKE THEM COMPLICATED.
MEDICARE
IS LOWER PREMIUMS, HIGHER
BENEFITS, COVERS EVERYONE.
IT
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLICATED,
JUST DO MEDICARE FOR ALL.
POLITICALLY IT HELPS YOU 60%, AS
TRUMP IS CHIPPING AWAY AT
OBAMACARE AND TRYING TO DESTROY
AND DISMANTLE IT ONE BY ONE,
DEMOCRATS, THIS IS THE TIME.
THEY ARE SO SCARED, SOMETIMES
THEY ARE SO PATHETIC, THERE ARE
ALWAYS ARTICLES LIKE BERNIE
SANDERS, HE IS PROPOSING IT, AND
NOW SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
TO PRETEND TO BE IN FAVOR OF IT
BUT IT GIVES REPUBLICANS
AMMUNITION TO COUNTERATTACK.
>>THEY ATTACKED YOU.
>>FIRST OF ALL REPUBLICANS
ALWAYS ATTACK.
SECOND OF ALL
THEY ARE DESTROYING HEALTHCARE,
THIRD OF ALL THEY ARE
COUNTERATTACKING ON A POSITION
WHERE YOU HAVE 60% POPULARITY.
FOR GOD'S SAKE TAKE ACTION TO
FIX IT, THE WAY TO FIX IT IS NOT
TO MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED,
IT'S TO GIVE US MEDICARE FOR
ALL, AND I PROMISE YOU THAT IF
TRUMP DID ANYTHING DECENT LIKE
FOR EXAMPLE PROMISED TO TAKE
AWAY THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES AND
MEDICARE, THAT'S PART OF
OBAMACARE, IT'S AN OUTRAGE, IT'S
TOTALLY WRONG, BUSH HAD DONE
THE SAME THING OBAMA SAID HE
WOULD STOP IT AND HE DIDN'T,
TRUMP SAID HE WOULD STOP IT AND
HE DIDN'T, THEY ARE ALL BOUGHT
BY THESE DRUG COMPANIES AND IT'S
GROSS, IF TRUMP KILLED THAT PART
OF OBAMACARE I WOULD'VE LOVED
IT.
>>THAT ONE PART.
>>THAT ONE PART.
BUT THAT WOULD
SAVE US UNTOLD BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS, MAYBE EVEN TRILLIONS,
IT'S A GIANT PART OF THE
EQUATION.
AND IT'S A MONOPOLY
THEY DON'T DESERVE.
BUT TRUMP OF
COURSE DIDN'T DO THE ONE THING
THAT COULD HELP EVEN THOUGH HE
PROMISED IT, HE DID THE OPPOSITE
AND SCREWED YOU OVER ON
YOUR INSURANCE.
