1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:02,666
MUST SEE TV HEARINGS ON CAPITOL

2
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:02,967
HILL.

3
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:05,403
BUT THIS WOULD BE TOWARDS THE

4
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:06,003
TOP OF THE LIST.

5
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:07,171
>> THANKS.

6
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,641
JOINING US NOW TO REACTION TO

7
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:22,253
HER REPORT, TOM, FORMER CLINTON

8
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:25,022
ADVISOR.

9
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:29,226
AND GUYS, I WILL START WITH YOU,

10
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:29,627
GREG.

11
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:32,863
WE ARE SENDING NOW THIS GUY

12
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:36,934
MANAFORT TO JAIL CLAIMING THE --

13
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:39,403
THE JUDGE IS SAYING HE TRIED TO

14
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:42,540
TAMPER WITH WITNESSES.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,642
WHY IS HE IN THE JAIL AND THE

16
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:45,409
REST ARE NOT?

17
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:46,744
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

18
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:48,412
THE JUDGE SHOULD BLAME HERSELF.

19
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:52,316
SHE FAILED TO ISSUE A NO CONTACT

20
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:55,286
HEARD WITH REGARD TO THE

21
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:56,353
WITNESSES.

22
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:57,555
I READ THROUGH THE COURT

23
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:58,255
DOCUMENTS.

24
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:00,624
WEISSMAN AND ROBERT MUELLER'S

25
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:03,661
EVIDENCE OF THIS IS SCANT.

26
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:04,795
AND CRYPTIC.

27
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:07,665
IT'S ENOUGH TO REVOKE BAIL

28
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:10,601
BECAUSE THAT'S A LOW THRESHOLD.

29
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:14,205
BUT THEY ALSO WERE CHARGING HIM

30
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:16,040
WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IN

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,274
AN INDICTMENT.

32
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:19,176
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS GIVEN THE

33
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:19,543
EVIDENCE.

34
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:21,645
>> YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT FOR

35
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:25,883
THEM TO DO THIS, THEY INDICT HIM

36
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:26,183
AGAIN.

37
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:28,185
THEY THREATEN HIM AND NOW THROW

38
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:29,487
HIM IN JAIL.

39
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:31,255
THEY MUST BE DESPERATE.

40
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:33,724
THIS IS A GUY WHO IS CHARGED

41
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:35,259
WITH A CRIME THAT OCCURRED 12

42
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,127
YEARS AGO THAT HALF OF THE

43
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:37,595
PEOPLE WHO ARE LOBBYING SHOULD

44
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:40,264
BE IN THE SAME LOCK UP WITH HIM.

45
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:41,899
WHAT DO THEY THINK HE HAS ON

46
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:42,199
TRUMP?

47
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:45,803
HE WAS ONLY WITH HIM FOR A FEW

48
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:46,137
MONTHS.

49
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:47,938
>> THEY KNOW HE HAS NOTHING ON

50
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:48,239
TRUMP.

51
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,007
THAT NEVER STOPPED PROSECUTORS

52
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,475
FROM PUTTING A DOCUMENT IN FRONT

53
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:53,944
OF SOMEBODY THAT THEY ARE

54
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:55,980
SQUEEZING AND SAY SIGN THIS.

55
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,014
THEY DON'T CARE THOSE

56
00:01:57,014 --> 00:02:00,084
PROSECUTORS ABOUT THE RULE OF

57
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:03,888
LAW AND PERJURY.

58
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:07,725
THEY SUBBORN PERJURY BY

59
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,092
SQUEEZING WITNESSES AND THAT'S A

60
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:09,393
TIME.

61
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:12,029
>> TOM, THE PROSECUTOR IN ME

62
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:15,733
WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT KIND OF

63
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,600
THING.

64
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,335
THE FEDS ARE A DIFFERENT FREED

65
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:19,203
OF CATS.

66
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:21,772
YOUR TAKE WITH MANAFORT BEING IN

67
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:22,072
JAIL?

68
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:25,309
WHAT DO THEY THINK HE WILL SAY

69
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:27,077
OTHER THAN PERJURE HIMSELF?

70
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:29,413
>> AS THE ANTI-CORRUPT WATCH DOG

71
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,650
IN ME SUGGESTS THIS IS

72
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,851
RETALIATION BY THE MUELLER TEAM

73
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:36,887
FOR MANAFORT'S PUSHING BACK

74
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:37,421
AGAINST AUTHORITIES.

75
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:37,788
>> YES.

76
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:40,491
>> I THINK IT'S OVERKILL.

77
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:42,226
I THINK THE MUELLER OPERATION

78
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:43,027
RECOGNIZES THAT MANAFORT IS THE

79
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:44,895
REASON FOR BEING.

80
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:47,364
THERE IS NO MUELLER

81
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:49,667
INVESTIGATION TO SPEAK OF

82
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,736
WITHOUT THIS BIG MANAFORT

83
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:53,137
INDICTMENT.

84
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:54,438
MULTIPLE INDICTMENTS NOW.

85
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:57,308
YOU SHUT DOWN THE MANAFORT

86
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:57,741
INVESTIGATION.

87
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:00,377
EVERYTHING FLITTERS AWAY BECAUSE

88
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:02,546
THE TRUMP INVESTIGATION IS GOING

89
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:02,880
NOWHERE.

90
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,417
THERE IS NO RUSSIAN COLLUSION.

91
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,686
A NICE DISTRACTION FROM THE IG

92
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,554
REPORT THAT CONFIRMS THE MUELLER

93
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:14,525
OPERATION WAS GENERATED AS A

94
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,093
RESULT OF THE CROOKED FBI AGENTS

95
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:17,528
WHO HATED DONALD TRUMP AND SET

96
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:20,664
THIS THING IN NOTION AND WERE

97
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:21,832
WORKING FOR MUELLER FOR A GOOD

98
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:22,633
PERIOD OF TIME.

99
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:26,437
THE WHOLE THING IS TAINTED.

100
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,006
WHITEHURST SCANDAL WITH THE FBI

101
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:29,306
LABS.

102
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:32,643
THROW OUT ALL OF THE CASES.

103
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:36,247
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IS AMAZING TO

104
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:37,381
ME, TOM.

105
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:40,050
I HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN YOU CREDIT

106
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,118
FOR YOUR INFORMATION.

107
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:43,420
NOW WE FIND OUT WHY WAS THIS

108
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,456
TEXT NEVER GIVEN TO CONGRESS?

109
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:48,092
THE ONE WHERE HE SAID, WE ARE

110
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,960
GOING TO STOP IT.

111
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,962
HE WON'T BE PRESIDENT?

112
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,330
NO, WE WILL STOP IT.

113
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,033
SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR NOT

114
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,768
GIVING THAT TO CONGRESS.

115
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:00,938
>> YOU CAN'T BLAME THE OBAMA

116
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:03,707
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR THAT.

117
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:07,478
IT'S THIS FBI COVERING UP ALL OF

118
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:08,646
THESE EMAILS.

119
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:10,848
THEY ARE FIGHTING EVERY SCANDAL

120
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:13,250
ISSUE THE IG HAS RAISED.

121
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,152
THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN US ONE TEXT

122
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,019
MESSAGE.

123
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,488
THEY ARE HOLDING BACK

124
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,523
INFORMATION ABOUT DOJ COLLUSION

125
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:20,891
WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

126
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:21,925
THIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND NOT

127
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,227
THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

128
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,529
>> ALL RIGHT.

129
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:27,731
MARK PENCE, AS YOU LISTEN TO

130
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,868
THIS, WHAT HE SAID IS THE CASE.

131
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:33,270
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN JUSTICE

132
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,671
DEPARTMENT.

133
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:36,140
>> WELL, BUT IT'S REALLY A STATE

134
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,840
UNTO ITSELF.

135
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,345
WHAT HAPPENED HERE WITH THE

136
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:43,147
RECUSAL AND THE INDEPENDENT

137
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:44,281
COUNSEL AND ROB ROSENSTEIN THEY

138
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:45,582
ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO CONGRESS

139
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:46,817
AND CAN'T BE FIRED BY THE

140
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:47,184
PRESIDENT.

141
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:50,587
THEY CREATED A GOVERNMENT OF

142
00:04:50,587 --> 00:05:00,297
THEIR OWN WHICH WE THOUGHT COULD

143
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:02,733
NO LONGER HAPPENING.

144
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,500
MANAFORT.

145
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,336
WEINSTEIN IS OUT ON A MILLION

146
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:06,136
DOLLARS BAIL.

147
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:08,138
>> HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

148
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:09,039
>> RIGHT.

149
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,908
>> TELL ME WHAT LEAGUE IS

150
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:12,242
MANAFORT IN?

151
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:15,212
THE JUDGE HERE IS CAHOOTS WITH

152
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:17,147
THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO

153
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,248
PRESSURE MANAFORT TO THE LIMIT

154
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:19,516
BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY GUY

155
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:20,317
PLEADING NOT GUILTY.

156
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:22,753
>> I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,

157
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:24,822
MARK, THAT'S INTERESTING.

158
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:27,057
AS THE PUBLIC WATCHES THIS

159
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:27,558
PROCEED.

160
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:30,027
WHO WOULD THINK IF MANAFORT

161
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:33,597
TURNED ON THE PRESIDENT NOW IF

162
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:35,165
ANYTHING HE SAID WOULD HAVE ANY

163
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:37,568
TRUTH TO IT GIVEN THE FACT THEY

164
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:39,236
ARE SQUEEZING HIM.

165
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:41,071
RIGHT NOW HOROWITZ IS GOING TO

166
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:43,240
TESTIFY ON MONDAY.

167
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,711
HE WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY IN

168
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,313
SPITE OF THE PREJUDICES HE

169
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:51,849
STATED AND THE REPORT AND THE

170
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,450
ACTIONS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO

171
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,252
CALL FOR A CRIMINAL CHARGE

172
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:55,719
AGAINST ANYONE.

173
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,089
>> HE NEEDS TO SAY, LOOK, I

174
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:01,792
COULD NOT PROVE THEIR BIASSED

175
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:02,593
INFLUENCED DECISIONS.

176
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:03,260
>> CORRECT.

177
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,995
>> I HAVE TO SHOW YOU THIS.

178
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:06,563
THIS IS PROOF.

179
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:07,931
500 PAGES OF PROOF.

180
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:10,934
>> OH, SURE.

181
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:17,741
IT'S A REPORT OF BIAS.

182
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,676
DID IT INFLUENCE THE DECISION TO

183
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:22,045
CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON?

184
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,782
I CAN'T PROVE IT TRUE.

185
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,250
OF COURSE HE CAN'T.

186
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,385
NOBODY PUTS THEIR CRIMES IN

187
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:30,621
RECT.

188
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:38,729
NOBODY CONFESSES TO HOROWITZ.WRT

189
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:38,762
NOBODY CONFESSES TO HOROWITZ.WRN

190
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:40,931
NOBODY CONFESSES TO HOROWITZ.

191
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:44,401
>> A TRIED A LOT OF MURDER CASES

192
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,103
WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

193
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:47,271
THIS IS MORE THAN

194
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:47,738
CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

195
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:48,672
PEOPLE ARE DESCRIBING WHAT THEIR

196
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:50,607
STATE EVER MIND IT.

197
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:53,677
>> THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS A

198
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:55,412
TYPICAL GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRAT.

199
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:56,380
EVERYTHING THAT HILLARY CLINTON

200
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,647
DID.

201
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,650
ALL OF THESE DECISIONS THAT THE

202
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,452
PROSECUTORS AND FBI MADE, THAT

203
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:03,153
FELL DOWN IN HER FAVOR AND

204
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:06,290
HELPED PROTECT HER, THEY ALL

205
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,292
WERE DEFENSIBLE.

206
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:10,494
HE COULD NOT SECOND GUESS THEM.

207
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:13,897
I DON'T BUY ANY OF THAT.

208
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:17,401
PEOPLE SHOULD READ THE REPORT

209
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:17,734
AGAIN.

210
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:20,103
THE CLINTON EMAILS INVESTIGATION

211
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:21,004
WAS A SHAM AND THE RUSSIAN

212
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:22,539
INVESTIGATION WAS TAINTED BY

213
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:24,441
THIS ANTI-TRUMP BIAS.

214
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:25,709
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE STILL

215
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:26,810
TALKING ABOUT A MUELLER

216
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,911
INVESTIGATION AFTER THERE STRZOK

217
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,613
SAID HIS GOAL WAS TO STOP TRUMP.

218
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:31,081
>> RIGHT.

219
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,649
MARK, LAST QUESTION.

220
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:37,354
WHAT HAPPENS TO JIM COMEY'S BOOK

221
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:38,789
A HIGHER LOYALTY NOW?

222
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,492
>> I HOPE SALES ARE CUT OFF.

223
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:46,563
THE WHOLE WAY HE ACTED HERE IN

224
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:49,166
DEFIANCE.

225
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,435
YOU EXPECT HIM TO BE IN DEFIANCE

226
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:52,936
NOW THAT HE IS A PRIVATE

227
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:53,270
CITIZEN.

228
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,375
I THOUGHT AND I WROTE A PIECE A

229
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,510
HIGHER DISLOYALTY.

230
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,615
I THINK HE BROUGHT DOWN THE FBI.

231
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:08,552
HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE WINNER

232
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:11,321
IN THIS REPORT BECAUSE THEY SAID

233
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:14,191
THE ACTIONS WERE REASONABLE.

234
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:17,127
I THINK COMEY AND THE FBI WERE

235
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:17,561
LOSERS.

236
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:20,731
THEY DIDN'T OPERATE IN A

237
00:08:20,731 --> 00:00:00,000
REMOTELY PROFESSIONAL WAY.
