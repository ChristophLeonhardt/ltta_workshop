00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:12,526
REPORTEDLY WEIGHING THEIR

00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:13,794
OPTIONS OF HOUSING MILITARY

00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:14,661
CHILDREN AT MILITARY BASES AND A

9
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:16,663
NEW BILL COULD LEAD TO JAIL TIME

10
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:18,231
FOR SANCTUARY CITY LEADERS.

11
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:20,233
ALL THIS IS THE PRESIDENT MEETS

12
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:21,968

18
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:30,644
PULL ANY PUNCHES: U.S.

19
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:31,345
IMMIGRATION LAWS THE WORST IN

20
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:32,045
THE WORLD.

21
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,680
THE PRESIDENT WAS CLEARLY

22
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,082
SURROUNDED BY A FRIENDLY

00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:38,618
WHO SUPPORT HIS IMMIGRATION

25
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:39,419
POLICY, SO THERE WAS LITTLE IN

26
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,221
THE WAY OF DEBATE.

27
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:42,155
THE MEETING WAS INTENDED MORE TO

28
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:43,757
PUSH THE IMMIGRATION AGENDA

29
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:46,460
FORWARD AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS

30
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,627
THERE ARE SMALL STEPS IN THE

31
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:48,428
RIGHT DIRECTION.

32
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:49,429
WATCH.

LOOPHOLES, ESPECIALLY THE

36
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:57,637
DISGRACEFUL PRACTICE OF CATCH

37
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:58,438
AND RELEASE.

38
00:00:58,438 --> 00:00:59,306
THAT'S WHERE YOU CATCH SOMEBODY,

39
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:01,875
TALK TO THEM, SIGN THEM AND THEN

40
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:05,010
YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM.

41
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,014
AND IT'S A HORRIBLE SITUATION.

CHILDREN.

59
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:38,712
HHS WON'T CONFIRM THE STORY

60
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,848
