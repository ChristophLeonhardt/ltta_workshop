well the sensors at Facebook are at it again yeah we all know that nudity even an Elaine Benes style nip slip is verboten on Facebook but banning a Picasso that depicted an abstract nude image oh yeah it really did happen I still want to know if the censors at Facebook are real albeit really dumb human beings or if those sensors are part of an artificial intelligence algorithm that's big on artificiality but severely lacking in intelligence and I'm sure the fine folk at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts are pondering this query too recently the museum took out an online ad for its Picasso exhibit and the ad was promptly rejected for wait for it violating Facebook's anti nudity policy now according to a story in the National Post Museum spokeswoman Pascal chase says the advertisement was blocked because it showed Picasso's painting entitled the femme Zala toilet which features two nude woman by the way just in case the phrase two nude woman conjures up a hustler magazine centerfold this is what Femmes a lot eyelet looks like yeah pretty photorealistic wouldn't you say but wait now I think I see a breast maybe two oh my god there are boobs a poppet in that painting granted abstract boobs rendered in the cubism style I believe but mammary gland flesh nevertheless how outrageous what are those dirty Birds at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts going to do for an encore screen the entire Russ Meyer catalog from faster pussycat kill kill to beneath the valley of the ultra vixens golly thankfully after receiving well deserved international mocking Facebook did an about-face the museum's original ad is back online and in an attempt to further save face the Facebook flashes are I mean fellows are promising to review their policies regarding fine art in fact while Facebook's current criteria doesn't generally allow nudity and ads the company said it wants to make sure museums can share their most iconic paintings oh that's mighty highbrow of them don't you think now Facebook's flip-flop turned out to be a good news story for the Montreux Museum of Fine Art given the reams of free publicity that came from it there remains a disturbing element to this story namely the likes of Facebook and other social media companies such as YouTube and Twitter are getting increasingly more sense or happy especially with content that does not fit into their particular worldview if we can't expect a company like Facebook to get it right regarding an iconic work of art then how can we expect them to get it right regarding anything else for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
