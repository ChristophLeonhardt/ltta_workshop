00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,759
let's dive headfirst right into these

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,850
awesome questions Roger says in the long

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,590
haul can<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve Jobs compete against</font>

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,090
millions of innovators around the world

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,920
who are hungry after apple's obscene

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,580
profit awesome question Roger I don't

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,619
think in the long long haul Steve Jobs

8
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,449
candies one man there's millions coming

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,969
after him but in the short term 5-10

10
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,230
years I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine they've</font>

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,180
got crazy amounts of cash and they're

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,270
very inventive<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is a better</font>

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,219
question I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think are a better company to</font>

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,780
look at in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this regard because they have</font>

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,280
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great product and they're</font>

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,989
sort of feeling around looking for that

17
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,059
second thing and if they'll find it

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,200
they'll be in great shape but a lot of

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after them I think</font>

00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,270
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> question from Jeremy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hua handsets</font>

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,219
will evolve into your go everywhere do

22

everything device Microsoft has nothing

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that arena and the best it could do</font>

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,438
embarrassing failure zune coming on the

heels of its previous failure played for

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,420
sure has anyone actually ever seen a

zune in the wild anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that doesn't exist and hasn't been even</font>

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,420
hinted at by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple much less confirmed</font>

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,210
it's retarded do you guys really have

34
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,579
nothing better to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> than argue the</font>

35
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,380
merits and price points of an imaginary

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,040
device Daniel you must be new here

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,090
obviously we don't have anything better

38
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,030
to do but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a product</font>

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,829
that seems you know a lot of speculation

40
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,180
that's coming out it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a big</font>

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal for Apple and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

42
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,750
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal just not just for Apple you</font>

43
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,790
talk about publishers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or trying to use</font>

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,560
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to position themselves for the future</font>

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,320
it's um it's a big product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,700
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it if it</font>

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
does come out and it turns out our

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,100
readers<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enjoy reading about it</font>

49
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,380
final question from lily white with the

50
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,000
juju have been more impressive if

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,790
TechCrunch were still involved honestly

52
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,259
I don't see how it would have been more

53
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,568
impressive from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the reports that</font>

54
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,450
Arrington is put on TechCrunch he said

55
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically they were involved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

56
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,830
up until the last minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we saw</font>

57
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,500
appears to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they were testing and</font>

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,780
working on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TechCrunch isn't you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

59
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,630
Michael Arrington isn't a coder Engineer

60
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,600
designer he could have put a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font>

61
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,060
of input into it and he probably did but

62
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,130
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what having him pull out at</font>

63
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,670
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a month before it was</font>

64
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,310
shown to the public would have helped

65
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,810
would it have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been better for the juju</font>

66
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,400
that have TechCrunch on board and not

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,560
have animosity I think so you have a

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,480
really huge community around TechCrunch

69
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,280
and people who like Michael Arrington

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're sort of angry at the juju for</font>

71
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,760
coming out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it's been</font>

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,540
portrayed so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the design and</font>

73
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,280
the product itself want to benefit about

74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,470
marketing certainly would have well

75
00:02:58,470 --> 00:00:00,000
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> hanging out guys</font>
