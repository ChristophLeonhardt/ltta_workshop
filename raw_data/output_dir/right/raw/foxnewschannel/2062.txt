TO JOHN KERRY IN LIGHT OF THIS?

37
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:10,916
>> HE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED UNDER

38
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,517
THE LOGAN ACT, I DON'T

39
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:15,153
PARTICULARLY LIKE THE LAW.

00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:18,823
IT WAS USE TODAY THREATEN PEOPLE

00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:20,559
, BUT IF IT'S GOING TO BE

42
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,527
USED AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND IT

43
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:26,031
WAS CERTAINLY USED AGAINST MIKE

44
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,701
FLYNN TO CREATE ENTRAPMENT, IF

45
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:32,737
YOU WILL, IT'S A PRETTY PLAIN

46
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:34,139
THAT HE'S IN VIOLATION OF THE

47
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:37,309
ACT SO WHY NOT THROW IT AT HIM?

48
00:01:37,309 --> 00:01:39,945
JILLIAN: PART OF LOGAN ACT, ANY

49
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:40,912
CITIZEN WITHOUT AUTHORITY OF THE

00:01:40,912 --> 00:01:42,547
UNITED STATES DIRECTLY OR

ON ANY CORRESPONDENCE WITH ANY

53
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:47,252
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT WITH INTENT

54
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:50,522
TO INFLUENCE THE MEASURES IN

55
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:55,393
RELATION TO TO ANY DISPUTES

56
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:57,362
SHOULD BE TITLED OR IMPRISONED,

57
00:01:57,362 --> 00:02:04,169
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

58
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:05,036
>> IT'S BEEN USED.

59
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:07,439
JOHN KERRY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,074
TO TEST AGAINST HIMSELF AND I

61
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:10,675
DON'T THINK THE FOREIGN MINISTER

62
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:10,976
WILL.

63
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:12,043
IF CONGRESS DOESN'T LIKE IT,

64
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:13,244
THEY CAN REPEAL IT.

65
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:13,912
WE HAVE TO HAVE FAIRNESS.

66
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:16,715
THE LAWS HAVE TO APPLY TO

67
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:17,082
EVERYONE.

68
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:18,183
JILLIAN: RIGHT.

69
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,551
ROB: LET'S LISTEN TO CHAIRMAN OF

70
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:23,688
THE ARM FORCES COMMITTEE TALKING

71
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:25,223
ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION.

72
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,291
>> I'M NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED

73
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,560
TO STICKING WITH THE DEAL

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,463
FOREVER, YOU NEED TO HAVE CLEAR

75
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:34,332
IDEA OF NEXT STEPS, MAYBE THE

76
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:35,600
BEST THING FOR THE PRESIDENT TO

77
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,235
DELAY A BIT MORE THE DEADLINE OF

78
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:38,503
THIS MONTH AND PUT THE FRENCH

79
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,338
AND THE BRITISH UP TO THE TEST

80
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:41,706
ABOUT WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO

81
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:44,109
GET THIS OTHER SORT OF

82
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:44,476
AGREEMENT.

83
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:47,045
ROB: SO CHRISTIAN, HEARING HIS

84
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:48,446
SIDE, AND THAT WAS FROM

85
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:49,648
YESTERDAY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS

86
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:50,915
THING, I THINK WHAT IT IS IS

87
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:52,117
THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF THE

88
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:53,485
DIFFERENT VOICES SAYING, WE NEED

89
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:55,320
TO STAY IN THE DEAL, ALL OF

90
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,022
EUROPE, MOST DEMOCRATS, A LOT OF

91
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:58,356
REPUBLICANS TOO, WHAT BOTHERS

92
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:01,393
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WHAT I

93
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:02,360
THINK BOTHERS THE TRUMP

94
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,428
ADMINISTRATION, WE ENTER DEALS

95
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:04,663
AND WE NEGOTIATE WITH THE

96
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:05,730
HORRIBLE COUNTRIES THAT HATE US

97
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,932
AND WE TRY TO BASICALLY PAY THEM

98
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:14,205
TO PLAY NICE, I MEAN, THAT BOTHE

99
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:15,540
TO PLAY NICE, I MEAN, THAT BOTHS

100
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:15,940
PEOPLE.

101
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,309
>> RIGHT, AND THE AMERICAN

102
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:19,811
PEOPLE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE

103
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,513
IRANIAN REGIME IS ABOUT.

104
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:25,183
WE MAY HAVE IRANIAN MODERATES

105
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:28,553
THAT WE CAN REACH OUT TO BUT

106
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:29,921
IRANIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN AT

107
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:35,427
WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.

108
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:38,029
THE IDEA IS TO MOVE BEYOND THIS

109
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,731
APPEASEMENT PACT TO BE ABLE TO

110
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,366
PUT TOUGHER SANCTIONS ON IRAN IF

111
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,968
THEY DO VIOLATE, YOU KNOW, BUILD

112
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:46,271
UP A NUCLEAR ARSENAL OR DO OTHER

113
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,806
THINGS THAT ARE HARMFUL TO US.

114
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:49,174
SO ALSO, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT

115
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:50,842
WAS CLEAR, HE TOOK THE SIDE OF

116
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:52,544
THE IRANIANS WHO WERE IN THE

117
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:54,079
STREETS PROTESTING THE REGIME

118
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,613
AND SO THOSE ARE THE FUNDMENTS

119
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,749
OF BIG AND IMPORTANT POLICY.

120
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:59,584
JILLIAN: CHRISTIAN, WE HAVE TO

121
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:02,787
LET YOU GO, WHAT DO YOU THINK

122
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:03,788
ENDS UP HAPPENING?

123
00:04:03,788 --> 00:00:00,000
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT PULLING
