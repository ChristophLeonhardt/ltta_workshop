1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,977
SCARE ME.

2
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:02,312
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT I

3
00:00:02,312 --> 00:00:03,680
WATCH THIS STUFF EVERY DAY.

4
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,948
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

5
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:05,749
SMART ANALYSIS AS ALWAYS.

6
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:06,216
>> THANK YOU.

7
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:08,752
>> THE BEAUTY OF BEING A

8
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:10,954
LIBERAL POLITICAL ANALYST IN

9
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:12,756
2018 IS, IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.

10
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:13,890
NO MATTER WHAT THE ISSUE IS,

11
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,292
OR THE CONCERN MIGHT BE,

12
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:17,060
IT'S THE SAFE BET THAT YOU

13
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,361
TIE IT DIRECTLY TO TRUMP.

14
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,297
NO MATTER WHAT, HURRICANES,

15
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,564
HIGHER GAS PRICES.

16
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:26,136
THE ONGOING WAR OR FAMINE.

17
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,438
EVEN ROSEANNE BARR'S TWITTER

18
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:29,506
FEED, ALL OF THEM ARE ABOUT

19
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:29,806
TRUMP.

20
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:30,874
WATCH THIS AS COLLEGE

21
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:31,808
PROFESSOR AND PROFESSIONAL

22
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:33,910
SHAKE DOWN ARTIST MICHAEL

23
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,112
ERIC DYSON SHOW US HOW IT'S

24
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:36,413
DONE.

25
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:37,080
THIS IS MSNBC LAST NIGHT.

26
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,548
>> WE HAVE A BIGOTED CHIEF

27
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:39,849
AND RACIST IN RESIDENCE.

28
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:40,417
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

29
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,419
HE HAS UNLEASHED SOME OF THE

30
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:44,487
MOST HORRENDOUS VIEWPOINTS,

31
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:45,822
BIGOTRIES AND RACISM IN THIS

32
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:46,156
COUNTRY.

33
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:48,124
HE HAS LEGITIMATED THEM,

34
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:48,692
VALIDATED THEM.

35
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:50,026
HE SAID LOOK, IT'S OKAY.

36
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:51,094
COME OUT THE CLOSET.

37
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,829
COME OUT AND SPEAK

38
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:53,496
STRAIGHTFORWARDLY AND TELL

39
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:57,734
THE WORLD WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

40
00:00:57,734 --> 00:00:58,601
>> Tucker: WE LOWER OUR

41
00:00:58,601 --> 00:00:59,502
STANDARDS.

42
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:01,705
I KNOW WE ALL HATE TRUMP.

43
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:02,739
BUT SO STUPID.

44
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,607
NOT STUPID IS MARK STEYN WHO

45
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:05,474
JOINS US TONIGHT.

46
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:06,509
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

47
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,345
I FEEL LIKE -- YOU KNOW, I

48
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:09,412
DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE AND

49
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:11,147
I DON'T WANT TO BE

50
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:12,982
HISTORICAL

51
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:13,049
HYSTORICAL

52
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,684
HYSTERICAL LIKE THEY ARE.

53
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:15,785
THEY ARE MELTING DOWN IT

54
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:16,353
LOOKS LIKE TO ME.

55
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:16,986
>> YEAH.

56
00:01:16,986 --> 00:01:18,588
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING

57
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:19,055
ON, TUCKER.

58
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:22,258
I MEAN, WE LIVE IN A

59
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,493
COARSENED CULTURE.

60
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:24,627
AND EVERYBODY HAS SAID THAT.

61
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,963
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS

62
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:28,932
WHY SAMANTHA BEE, FOR

63
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:30,433
EXAMPLE, USED THE C-WORD IS

64
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,901
THAT THE F-WORD HAS BEEN

65
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:34,871
DRAINED OF ITS POWER.

66
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:38,808
IT WAS -- WHEN I BELIEVE IT

67
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,111
WAS KEN KINAN WHO FIRST SAID

68
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,147
THE F WORD ON THE TV IN THE

69
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:48,218
BBC BACK IN THE 1960'S, THE

70
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:49,686
IRISH PLAYWRIGHT IT H. DONE

71
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,488
IT A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE.

72
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,490
HE WAS SO DRUNK NOBODY

73
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,791
UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS THE

74
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:55,091
WORD.

75
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:56,826
KEN KINAN GOT THE CREDIT FOR

76
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,496
IT ON THE BBC.

77
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:02,532
AND THAT WORD HAS SO LOST

78
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:03,700
ITS FORCE IN PART BECAUSE

79
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,169
IT'S NOW SAID ROUTINELY ON

80
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,670
FAMILY SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE

81
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,107
HAD TO MOVE TO -- SAMANTHA

82
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:14,444
BEE HAD TO MOVE TO THE

83
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:14,778
C-WORD.

84
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:15,712
WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IS

85
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,947
THAT THE CROWD WENT

86
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:18,815
DELIRIOUSLY WILD ABOUT IT.

87
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:19,983
THERE IS NO JOKE THERE.

88
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,384
THERE IS NO INSIGHT THERE.

89
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:22,852
THERE IS NO PARTICULAR POINT

90
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:23,153
THERE.

91
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:24,387
BUT THE FACT THAT SHE SAID

92
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:28,291
THE C-WORD HAS THE -- WELL,

93
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,193
WE REALLY GOT OUR VALUE FOR

94
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:30,660
MONEY.

95
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,495
IF WE HAD BEEN HERE 120

96
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:33,630
YEARS AGO.

97
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,565
WE WOULD HAVE WANTED TO SEE

98
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:37,801
A TRAPEZE ARTIST OR A TAP

99
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,736
DANCER OR IRISH TENOR.

100
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,438
TODAY WE ARE HAPPY TO GO IN

101
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:43,373
A THEATER AND CHEER

102
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:44,073
DELIRIOUSLY WHEN SOMEBODY

103
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:45,341
SAYS THE C-WORD.

104
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:47,243
THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING

105
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:48,611
THAT IF ANYONE DIGS THAT

106
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,547
CLIP OUT IN SEVERAL DECADES,

107
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:54,250
THEY WILL BE INTERESTED TO

108
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,020
LOOK AT, I THINK.

109
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,021
>> Tucker: IT IS LOOK LIKE

110
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,189
AT OLD PICTURES FROM THE

111
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,390
REVOLUTION IN CHINA CHILDREN

112
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,925
WITH LITTLE RED BOOKS AND

113
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:03,626
SALUTING ALL THIS NONSENSE.

114
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,695
HOW COULD A HUGE GROUP OF

115
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:07,430
PEOPLE GO SIMULTANEOUSLY

116
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,897
INSANE?

117
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:09,799
IT'S MASS TIS HAIR I CAN'T.

118
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,067
IT'S A HUMAN THING.

119
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,902
WHAT IN THE END IS THE

120
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:13,570
EFFECTIVENESS.

121
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,505
DO NORMAL PEOPLE LOOK ON AND

122
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:18,074
SAY SAMANTHA BEE HAS GOT TO

123
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,008
BE KATHY GRIFFIN TWO.

124
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,510
TWO OF THE UNHAPPIEST PEOPLE

125
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,411
IN AMERICA I DON'T WANT

126
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:22,145
ANYTHING THEY ARE SELLING.

127
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:23,813
OR DO THEY SAY WOW, SIGN ME

128
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:25,014
UP FOR WHATEVER SHE HAS GOT?

129
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:26,816
>> NO, I THINK THAT YOU ARE

130
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,384
TRITE DETECT A CERTAIN

131
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,085
JOYLESSNESS IN IT.

132
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,553
I THINK THERE IS ALSO A

133
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:31,921
LOGIC THOUGH.

134
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,090
WE HAVE TWO INCOT AT THAT

135
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,091
TIME TILLABLE TRACKS.

136
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,893
ON THE ONE HAND HAVE YOU

137
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:39,295
THIS GENERAL COARSENING F

138
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,030
WORD, C WORD, F WORD.

139
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,499
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE

140
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,133
YOU EVERMORE PROTECTED

141
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,902
CLASSES OF PEOPLE.

142
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:47,737
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT BECAUSE

143
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:48,972
THEY ARE BLACK, THEY ARE

144
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:50,106
GAY, THEY ARE MUSLIM, THEY

145
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,307
ARE TRANSGENDER, WHATEVER IS

146
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:52,375
NEXT DOWN THE PIKE.

147
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,344
WHICH MEEPTION THAT IT'S

148
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:56,479
ACTUALLY ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE

149
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,414
ASSOCIATED WITH TRUMP OR WHO

150
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,983
ARE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES

151
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:01,217
OR WHO ARE WHATEVER.

152
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:05,989
IT'S A VERY NAY ROW SLIVER

153
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,857
OF PEOPLE CAN YOU UNLEASH

154
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,792
THE BLIZZARD MUCH FNC WORDS

155
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,059
ON.

156
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,194
THAT'S THE CONTRADICTION.

157
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:12,962
AS WE HAVE TALKED BEFORE B.

158
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,464
BEFORE, TUCKER, IT'S

159
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,832
ACTUALLY KILLING COMEDY.

160
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:16,933
THE FANTASTIC THING ABOUT

161
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,134
THIS SCHOLARSHIP THAT IT IS

162
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,503
A SUPPOSED COMEDY SHOW.

163
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:22,137
IT'S GOT WRITERS AS TAMMY

164
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,573
WAS SAYING.

165
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:24,541
IT'S PRETAPED.

166
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,743
IT'S ALL CAREFULLY EDITED.

167
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:27,644
BUT THERE ACTUALLY ISN'T A

168
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:31,581
JOKE IN THERE UNDER NEATH.

169
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:33,950
THERE IS JUST THE WORD.

170
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,584
>> Tucker: I KNOW IT WAS

171
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,619
ONLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO

172
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:38,821
REMIND ME WHY NTSB FIRED

173
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:39,589
BILLY BUSH.

174
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:42,125
HE LAUGHED AT A JOKE THAT

175
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,459
WAS LESS VULGAR THAN THIS

176
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,228
AND HE GOT FIRED AND THEY

177
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,529
DESTROYED HIS LIFE BECAUSE,

178
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:46,796
WHY?

179
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:47,430
DO YOU REMEMBER?

180
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,269
I DON'T REMEMBER.

181
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:55,038
THAT'S THE INJUSTICE HERE.

182
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:55,672
ROSEANNE WHO I DON'T THINK

183
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:56,806
IS ANY KIND OF CONSERVATIVE.

184
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:58,341
I HAVE NEVER SAID THAT BUT

185
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,544
ROSEANNE HAS HAD 40 YEARS OF

186
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:03,346
WORK VAPORIZED OVER HER

187
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:04,180
TWEET.

188
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,182
AND UNLIKE SAMANTHA BEE, SHE

189
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,383
IS ACTUALLY FUNNY AND SHE

190
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:09,252
WAS FUNNY IN A LEFTY WAY.

191
