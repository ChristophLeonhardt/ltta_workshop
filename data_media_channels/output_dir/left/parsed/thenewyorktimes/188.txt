“How you doing?
Got a driver’s license?
Where’s it at?”
“What—”
“Where’s your drivers li—
Back up.
You don’t see—”
“Hold on, hold on, hold on.”
“Don't touch me.”
You don’t see the issue here?
Hold on.”
“Don’t touch me.”
“You don’t see the issue here?”
“You’re not parked
across three lanes?”
“That’s cool. That’s cool.
We good, you can get back
in the car.”
“Yeah it’s cool?”
“Yeah, we good.”
“Back up.”
“Back up.”
“For what?”
“Are you obstructing me?”
“I just told you to back up.
I just told you to back up.”
“I just did.”
“—camera, O.K.?
“You touch me first so—”
“That’s right.
I told you to back off.”
“But don’t touch me.”
“”Cause you’re going to try
and get in the car.
I’ll do what I want, alright?”
“No you won’t.”
“I own this right here.”
“You don’t own me, though.”
“So, what’s your name?”
“I didn’t say I own you.
I said I own this.”
“But this is me.
Don‘t touch me, though.
You don’t own me.
”
“What’s your name?”
“What‘s your name?”
“It’s on there. Sterling Brown.”
“I’m asking you.”
“I’m telling you. Sterling Brown.”
“These are simple questions, man.”
“No, I’m answering them.”
“These are simple questions
and you’re being—
—and you‘re being like—
and you’re being all bad ass to me,
alright?”
“I’m not—”
I asked you a question
so I could verify this, O.K.?
You don’t think I
see these at our, whatever?”
“I don’t know.”
“So I‘m asking you your name.”
“I use real IDs, I don’t—”
“O.K., I don’t know who you are.
O.K.? So that’s why I asked.”
“O.K.”
“I asked for an I—
These are— These are
legitimate questions, right?
“I ain’t got no problem
with it.”
“O.K., well you look at me
like I got something
growing out of my head.”
“No, I'm just saying you
touching me.
That’s the initial—”
“Right because you
got up in my face, O.K.?“
“I got up in your face?”
“Right.”
“Really? Come on.”
“I ask you to back
up and you did not do it.
I asked you to back up
and you did not do it.
You backed up about three inches.
All right?
Everything I’m
doing is on camera, dude.”
“I don’t care—”
“These are legitimate—
These are legitimate requests.
Alright?
So can you explain this to me?”
“I mean—”
“Parked across— Parked across two—
You have an entirely
empty parking lot,
and you parked across two—
—go into the Walgreens,
at what time?”
“In and out.”
“Long enough time where
I sat here
about a minute and—”
“I was in and out.”
“—came out.”
“I was in and out, that’s it.”
“I did. I pulled up.
Parked right here.
I was in and out, right here.”
“So, what— what.
Like, what we doing?”
“I don’t know.
We're going to wait.”
“On what, though?”
“I'm waiting for my partner.”
“I understand that, but—”
“Well, you had time to park
across these lanes here,
so—”
“So?”
“So we’re going to wait
a little longer.”
“So, what?”
“We’re just going to
figure it out, man.”
“I know, all right, so what
are we figuring out right now?”
“We’re going to figure out
what we’re going to do.”
“Whether you’re going
to get tickets.
Whatever.”
“You can’t do that
by yourself?”
“Take your hands out
of your pockets now!”
“Hold on.
I got stuff in my hands.”
“Get down!”
“ Taser?”
“Hold on.”
“Watch the head!”
“Tase him. Tase him.”
“Taser! Taser! Taser!”
“Initially,
 roll up, I was going
to take a piss.
I see his car parked
like that.
He’s gone.
I say:
‘Is there a reason for this?’
An emergency or what not,
you know?
Which I’m thinking,
hey, maybe he’s got
a medical emergency
or something.
He needs to get in there?
And I asked her.
I said, ‘Where is he?’
He comes out and starts
getting in my face.
And I said,
‘Hey, back up.’
You know,
same thing as before.
And that‘s when I called 
for somebody else.
If the guy hadn’t been 
such a dick
it would have just been,
‘Hey, have a nice day.’
You know?
But then I thought, O.K.,
he’s being an ass.
He’s trying to hide something.”
“You, uh, you initiated everything.”
“No, you initiated everything.”
“You touched me.”
“Yeah I did.”
