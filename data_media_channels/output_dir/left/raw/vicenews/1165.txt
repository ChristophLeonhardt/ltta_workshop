1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,380
— Today, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,800
announced major new charges related
to the water crisis in Flint:

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,540
— Let me say that involuntary
manslaughter is a very serious crime.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,520
— Schuette charged the state’s Health
and Human Services Director, Nick Lyon,

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,320
with involuntary manslaughter in
the death of 85-year-old Robert Skidmore,

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,880
who lived in a Flint suburb and
died during a Legionnaire’s outbreak

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,600
connected to the city’s lead water crisis.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,760
— After allegedly being informed about
the growing legionellis situation in Flint,

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,040
Nick Lyon failed to inform the public
of this health threat...

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,480
— In fact,

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,420
Lyon allegedly knew about the outbreak
for a year before telling anyone.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,880
Four other state officials,

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,660
who have already pled not guilty to lesser allegations,

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,600
were also brought up on
involuntary manslaughter charges,

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,360
including the city’s former
Emergency Manager, Darnell Earley—

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,700
the man at the helm when
Flint switched its water source.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,640
That brings the total number of
current or former officials indicted to 17.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,280
Lyon and four others could go to prison for 15 years,

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,820
and the indictments mark a
turning point in the Flint investigation—

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,840
it’s the first time government officials have been

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,580
directly linked to deaths of Flint residents.

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,020
The culpability only goes so far—

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,940
today, Schuette confirmed that he won’t
be charging Michigan Governor Rick Snyder.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,980
— The fact that he's letting Governor Snyder
off the hook for manslaughter is appalling.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,480
That man, the Governor,

26
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,060
since we have been under state control since 2011,

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,040
has been the single decision-maker for the city of Flint.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,960
Every decision landed on his desk, and so he knew.

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,200
— Snyder and Schuette are both Republicans,

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,620
but they’ve frequently been on the
opposite sides of the Flint crisis.

31
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,980
There’s speculation that Schuette is
eyeing the governor’s mansion next year,

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,900
when Snyder term-limits out,

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,020
and the two men traded some
not-so-subtle political digs today—

34
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,520
when Snyder hit back at Schuette,

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,400
saying he had “full faith and confidence”
in the HHS Director,

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,200
and called on the AG to hurry up and give court dates

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,340
to people who’ve already been charged
with crimes against Flint.

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,880
— Everything that's happened to us
in Flint has been political.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,840
People have died.

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,859
All of these deaths could have
been prevented if these people,

41
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,700
who are in charge of our public safety and our health,

42
00:02:14,700 --> 00:00:00,000
did their job.
