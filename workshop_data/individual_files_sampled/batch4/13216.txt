according to a brand-new Rasmussen poll president Trump's approval numbers have now climbed back to 46% which is near the highest of his presidency all the other polls have reflected that bump as well the NBC Wall Street Journal poll over the weekend showed Trump at an all-time high of 45 percent now it is important to note that 45% is not 50% but it is also important to note that the presidents of the United States won his election when his approval rating was about 40 to 43 percent so you don't have to have really high approval ratings in order to win a presidential election and all of this despite the fact that president Trump's moves with Vladimir Putin last week in the Helsinki conference were not wildly popular with anybody except for Republicans the poll showed 53% of Republicans approved of Trump's behavior at his meeting with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin which isn't a good number among Republicans only six percent of Democrats did but none of that mattered much to the overall approval for President Trump the overall approval among Republicans for president Trump currently stands at 88 percent that is the highest intra-party approval ever polled ever polled so among Republicans no president has ever been more popular than president Trump is right now and that has something to do with President Truman has a lot more to do with President Trump's opponents as we'll talk about in a little while so what exactly is bolstering Trump's high approval rating or at least decent approval rating right now well the NBC Wall Street Journal poll suggests that Trump is very very reliant on the economy so 50 percent of Americans like the way he is handling the economy as opposed to only 36 percent of Americans who don't so all the Democratic talk about how the economy is going to collapse because of the tax cuts around the verge of an economic breakdown most Americans don't believe that they believe the economy is strong and President Trump is feeling the effects of that 51 percent of Americans dislike the way that Trump has handle Putin overall 58 percent disapprove of his immigration policy 53 percent approve of his tariff policy but this adds up to is about 45% of Americans overall approve of President Trump which for president Trump is a very good number 45 46 % and here's the thing those poll numbers have really not budged much for the President of the United States in the last two-and-a-half years Trump's approval rating has been remarkably stable since long before he was President of the United States he began his presidency at about 44 percent he is now at 45 percent after a year and a half not a lot of volatility in those polls news coverage simply doesn't touch Trump it doesn't touch him because pretty much everything is baked in and when people have an image of particular people and they jump to that image whenever they are in town so Republicans have an image of President Trump as a fighter who's willing to take on the media and who's being wrongly maligned by a bunch of people on the left and so whenever anything bad happens to Trump they jump right into that framework and Democrats have a framework of Trump where everything he's doing is simultaneously buffoonish and evil it's manipulative and clownish those are the two things that Trump is according to the left and so anything that Trump does has to fall into one of those two categories but the bottom line is that Trump is basically the Superbowl of public opinion
