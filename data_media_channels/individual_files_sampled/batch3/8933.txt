REALLY. Harris: CHRIS,VILLE TO CUT IN. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SPEAKING. LET'S WATCH. LOOKED LIKE A VERY FINE WOMAN TO ME. VERY FINE WOMAN. AND I THOUGHT THAT BRET'S TESTIMONY LIKEWISE WAS VERY SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT, I THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. BUT CERTAINLY SHE WAS A VERY CREDIBLE WITNESS. SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY RESPECTS. AND I THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE ON WARD OR IF WE ARE GOING TO GET A VOTE. AGAIN, I'M HERE, SO I'M NOT OUT THERE WATCHING BECAUSE I CAN'T BE I HAVE GREAT RESPECT ALTHOUGH MAYBE WE WILL GO WATCH TOGETHER, OKAY? WE WILL WATCH TOGETHER. BUT I THINK IT WILL WORK OUT VERY WELL FOR THE COUNTRY. I JUST WANT IT TO WORK OUT WELL FOR THE COUNTRY. IF THAT HAPPENS, I'M HAPPY. HAVE YOU THOUGHT AT ALL ABOUT A REPLACEMENT FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT. NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT. WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE FOR MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS? I HAVE NO MESSAGE. I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IT IS RIGHT. THERE IS NO MESSAGE WHATSOEVER. THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IS RIGHT. THEY HAVE TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THEMSELVES AND I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO REOPEN BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION INTO KAVANAUGH. I'M GOING TO RELY ON ALL OF THE PEOPLE, INCLUDING SENATOR GRASSLEY WHO IS DOING A VERY GOOD JOB. THAT WILL BE A DECISION THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE AND IS HE SUSPECT THEY WILL BE MAKING SOME DECISION SOON, WHETHER TO TAKE A VOTE OR TO DO WHATEVER ELSE HE WANT THIS TO DO. I WILL BE TOTALLY RELIKE ON WHAT SENATOR GRASSLEY AND THE GROUP DECIDES TO DO. OKAY? GOING TO TALK ABOUT VENEZUELA TODAY. I WAS WAITING FOR THAT QUESTION. WE WILL BE DISCUSSING VENEZUELA AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS. A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS GOING ON IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD. BUT, CHELE IS REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL. LOOK HOW FAR THEY HAVE COME. LOOK HOW WELL RUB THE COUNTRY IS. IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. WHATEVER THEY THINK IS NECESSARY IS OKAY. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE KNOW HE WANTS TO MEET WITH US. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
