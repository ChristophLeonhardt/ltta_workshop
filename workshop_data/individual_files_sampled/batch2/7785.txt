hurricane Harvey has severely flooded Houston Texas in fact there has been more than 20 inches of rain reported 300,000 people were left without power at various times and more than 7,000 people were evacuated and forced to stay at various shelters including the Brown Convention Center on Monday night now I'm sorry the George R Brown Convention Center now the capacity of that Convention Center is about 5,000 however there are varying reports indicating that there were between 7,000 to 11,000 people attempting to find shelter there so the situation is dire let's go to graphic 27 one individual says that it's quote hell he also says all my stuff damaged I have no clothes no shoes no clothing so people are desperate to find shelter and unfortunately there is very little room to house these individuals and keep them safe so as a result there have been some public figures who have faced criticism for what appeared to be them closing the doors on the residents of Houston Joel Olsteen who is a very well known prosperity gospel preacher originally shut his doors to residents of Houston he lives in the area as well however after criticism it appears that he opened the doors to his gigantic church which can house 16800 people and is now taking care of them now on Sunday Lakewood Church posted on Facebook that it was quote inaccessible due to severe flooding and directed displaced residents to shelters in the city the church can hold more than sixteen thousand eight hundred people the Facebook post did court criticism on social media where photos appear to suggest that the massive building had not been damaged by the rains all right so I'm gonna be as clear as I can on this story there is not a lot of clarity on what's really going on right so Joel Osteen is claiming that it was in an area that had a flood warning he claimed that you know the church was not flooded itself but the parking garage was full people who lived in the area said that's not true they shared pictures on social media and said there are cars driving in this area there's no flooding the church is completely fine even Snopes looked into it and said that the results of this story are mixed so it's really hard to assess the situation but what I will say is if I put myself in his shoes and I have very little love for him if I put myself in his shoes and I had a megachurch that used to be a stadium and there was any potential of flooding or harm I probably wouldn't take that risk because I don't want to risk anyone's life that's just where I'm at let me have it but here's the thing the entire city virtually the entire city of Houston is flooded yeah the people that are seeking refuge are seeking refuge from terrible flooding and if they go to some flooding or perhaps a place where there are services that's an improvement over where they're leaving yeah and so I think the fact that he didn't open it up as a shelter to some of these people I mean shelter is a funny word too because that church is a 16,000 capacity tax shelter right I mean they are subsidized yeah you know and he who gets shelter from our government didn't give shelter at a time where the risk I understand it I understand why you as Joel Osteen would be you know how reluctant hesitant right hesitancy a better word but still this is a disaster like you don't you know and he is a minister and he's an incredibly wealthy minister he lives in a $10,000,000 I have them over there but both what I'm saying what I'm saying is forget if he was the poorest minister in the world but he had a 16,000 seat sanctuary literally to have people that can come in there and there was a risk of flooding there's flooding everywhere it just doesn't ring true to me and I'm not saying you know I don't know enough about Joel Osteen it just it looks terrible to me it does look terrible to be fair in 2005 he did open his church to victims of Hurricane Katrina so you know in the past hee hee has helped people and and in a big way so I feel like with this story it's kind of hard to tell what's really going on and I feel bad criticizing him because again any time we do a story I want to put myself in the shoes of the person that I'm about to criticise and think about what I would do I don't have hard evidence indicating that you know it was either completely flooded a little flooded no threat of flooding whatsoever and so I just I hate the story because I don't know I don't know and Snopes doesn't know there's no article that's even clear on it and so you have to make a decision do you risk people's lives potentially risk people's lives or do you you know open your doors and shelter them any way you shut the open your doors near Sullivan yeah well he's doing that now so to me that and most ministers and pastors and and men and women of the cloth there are doing it and you know he may have done in Katrina he may have done many many things that have that make him a worthwhile citizen he made a bad call so despite where there wouldn't happen because there was water then there wasn't water there wasn't and it was again the the thought that I had when I saw this was Barris again it goes back to the policies and also support from your government that you fund many people mostly conservatives will say hey you know we got to stop handing out all this money to these gimme-gimme people and let the churches and charities help yeah churches and charities don't always help sometimes they do a lot of times they do sometimes they don't in this case when they don't whatever reason out of being cautious or just not feeling like it because he doesn't want all these people in his church whatever reason it may be he wasn't able to help or wasn't willing to help that's why you always have your government that you actually pay for do this right help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
