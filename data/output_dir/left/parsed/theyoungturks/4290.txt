>> FAMILY IN TENNESSEE HAS FILED
A FEDERAL CIVIL LAWSUITS AGAINST
A POLICE DEPARTMENT AFTER HE WAS
ARRESTED, RESTRAINED, AND TASED
SEVERAL TIMES WHILE HE WAS
RESTRAINED.
THE TEENAGER AT THE
CENTER IS AN 18-YEAR-OLD.
HE 
HAD
BEEN BOOKED ON CHARGES OF Ã± AND
APPARENTLY WHILE HE WAS IN A
CELL, HE HAD A MENTAL EPISODE
AND STARTED BANGING HIS HEAD
AGAINST THE WALL.
COPS WHO WORK
TO THEIR RESTRAINED HIM AND
WHILE HE WAS RESTRAINED THEY
TASED HIM.
WE HAVE THE VIDEO.
IT
IS HARD TO LOOK AT.
I WANT TO
GIVE YOU A WARNING.
LET'S TAKE A
LOOK.
>> SO HE IS OBVIOUSLY
RESTRAINED.
ARE THEY CLAIMING
THEY DID THIS BECAUSE THEY
DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO STUFF
AFTER?
OTHERWISE THIS IS JUST
GRATUITOUS TORTURE.
>>THIS VIDEO WENT ON FOR A LONG
TIME.
IT IS REALLY HARD TO LOOK
AT.
THE WHOLE REASON WHY THE
TASER IS AVAILABLE IS SO THEY
CAN SUBDUE SOMEONE WHO IS NOT
EASILY SUBDUED.
THERE HAVE BEEN
CASES OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED
BECAUSE THE TASER HIT THEIR
HEART.
>> IF SOMEONE IS HAVING A MENTAL
EPISODE, PLEASE BRING IN AN
EXPERT.
YOU ARE APPLYING THE
WRONG TOOL TO THE JOB.
THE ISSUE
IS HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT?
IF
THEY ARE HAVING A MENTAL EPISODE
THEY ARE NOT USING LOGIC.
YOU NEED A PROFESSIONAL TO HELP
YOU.
USING BRUTE FORCE IS LIKELY
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND WILL MAKE
HIM WANT TO REPEL MORE.
>> HE HAD AN EPISODE AND MAYBE
THAT IS WHY THEY WANTED TO
RESTRAIN HIM.
BY THE WAY HIS
STEPFATHER SAID THAT AFTER THE
TEEN WAS RELEASED ON BOND HE
COUNTED MORE THAN 40 BURNS ON
HIS BODY.
HERE IS MORE EVIDENCE
THEY PLAN ON USING IN THIS CASE.
IT IS JUST SO STUPID.
>> IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO THE
SAME THING, TRAINING.
AND NOT
EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES 
IT
THAT WAY.
SO LUCKILY IN THIS
CASE IT WAS NOT LETHAL BUT IT
COULD HAVE BEEN.
JUST BECAUSE
YOU HAVE A HAMMER DOESN'T
MEAN IT IS A NAIL.
THIS WAS NOT A HAMMER SITUATION.
>>LUCKILY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
MANAGED TO GET THAT VIDEO
RELEASED.
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE 
A
CASE.
