so I want to talk about abstinence before marriage and let me just say that this is the you know this is not this is not a religious conversation I'm not going to make a moral arguments non religious people you know they like to dismiss these kinds of these kinds of discussions and because they say well this is just religious it's it's it's fundamentalist but I think that's kind of it's kind of funny in a way it's kind of ironic because these those same non-religious people will also insist that you do not need to be religious in order to act with wisdom and prudence and you know that's religious people don't have a monopoly on that they'll say well saving sex for marriage is without question the wisest and most prudent path I don't think any rational person would deny that or can deny it convincingly yet it is a wise and prudent path that we are told is only open to the religious I disagree with that I guess I have a higher opinion I guess of non-religious people that non-religious people have of themselves because I don't you know I don't see it that way yeah it's true that religious people generally believe in saving sex for marriage I mean they believe you to believe in it ideally how successful they are and following through is a different matter but it's oh it's true that they believe in it but it's not true that you have to be religious in order to see the wisdom in such a strategy and I think if you wish to address our most serious social problems if you if you does if you desire the benefits that could come from solving these problems then then you should advocate for abstinence before marriage whether you're religious or not it doesn't doesn't matter this is a practical position now it may be a spiritual position as well but that's not you know that those two things don't necessarily have to be linked all the time like I also believe that that that murder is wrong and that is a I I believe that spiritually you know I believe it's wrong because the Ten Commandments says that it's wrong because God says it's wrong but um but I would still believe I would still advocate outlawing homicide you the Ten Commandments didn't exist and I would I would hold that position for very obvious and practical reasons right well I think the same is true of saving sex for marriage and I'm not comparing you know I'm not comparing having sex before marriage to murder I'm just saying that you know this is a this you can make a very practical argument in favor of it and I think anyone can see the benefits of that path and anyone can pursue that path regardless of religion so now what I want to do is I want to talk about the great societal this great societal crises that could be solved or at least greatly reduced by keeping sex within the framework of a monogamous and lifelong marriage so I'm not gonna say anything you'll notice I'm not gonna say anything about sin or avoiding hell or anything like that it's a different discussion from the one that I'm gonna have right now I want to talk about the temporal practical benefits of this course and I think that you know it's a very difficult thing when we look at our cultural problems and we say how are we gonna solve these problems but then at the outset we rule out the most effective solutions and it seems like we're always doing that you know there's like the the fundamental basic solution that gets right to the root of the problem but we rule that out we always rule those solutions out because those are lifestyle solutions those are solutions that require sacrifice and effort and hard work and so we rule those how do we say no no not not that but let's find something a little bit further up on the tree right the weekend with you know let's find a solution that's a little bit further up here that's a little bit closer to the surface a little bit more superficial and therefore easier and I just don't think I just don't think it works I think we have to get to the root of it and and and that's the only way to solve some of these problems
