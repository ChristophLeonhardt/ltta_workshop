1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,370
WE HAVE THE ANNUAL TRADITION
HERE IN AMERICA WHERE THE

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,970
PRESIDENT PARDONS A TURKEY, IT'S
PREPOSTEROUS.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,970
WE SLAUGHTER

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,990
MILLIONS OF THEM FOR THIS
HOLIDAY OF OURS, LET'S KEEP IT

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,930
REAL, BUT WE PARDON ONE -- ARE
WE NOT MAGNANIMOUS?

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,930
ANYWAY, IT'S

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,209
OKAY, IT HAPPENS.

8
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:17,490
TRUMP HAS NOT
DONE IT PARTICULARLY WORSE

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,460
NECESSARILY THAN ANYONE ELSE.

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,929
WELL, BE THE JUDGE FOR YOURSELF

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,230
-- I WANT TO SHOW YOU TRUMP
THINKING HE'S PARDONING A TURKEY

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,910
AND HOW IT TURNS OUT.

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,990
LET'S
WATCH.

14
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:37,289
WE WON'T SHOW THE ASPIRIN
OVER HERE.

15
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,370
HIS ASPIRIN.

16
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,160
AFTER THAT HE SAID I WILL NOT
PARDON YOU, YOU ARE TERRIBLE,

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,249
YOU ARE A FAKE TURKEY.

18
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,120
IN THAT
CASE THAT WOULD BE TRUE.

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
THAT

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,249
WAS FROM THE CAMPAIGN WHEN HE
HAD A GOOFY SHOOT WITH AN EAGLE.

21
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:57,219
ARE YOU READY, DRUMSTICK?

22
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,379
OKAY?

23
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:04,269
DRUMSTICK, YOU ARE HEREBY

24
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:10,640
PARDONED.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,189
PEOPLE TRY TO FIND SOMETHING
WRONG WITH EVERY SINGLE THING

26
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,320
DONALD TRUMP DOES.

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,030
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LOOK THAT HARD.

28
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,030
BUT IN

29
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,479
THIS CASE, SOME FOLKS HAVE
LOOKED TOO HARD.

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,479
I DON'T KNOW IF

31
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,640
THIS GUY IS JOKING OR NOT, BUT
DAVE BROWN WRITES TRUMP MAY HAVE

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,150
PARDONED THE WRONG BIRD.

33
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,250
OH MY
GOD, WE HAVE A CONSPIRACY AFOOT.

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,260
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE
WRONG BIRD.

35
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,329
WE ARE KILLING

36
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,859
99.999% OF THEM, IT COULD HAVE
BEEN ANOTHER BIRD AND WHAT

37
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:40,939
DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE?

38
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,320
I HOPE
HE WAS JOKING -- THERE'S NO REAL

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,369
CONSPIRACY HERE.

40
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,310
IN FACT, I
PARDON DONALD TRUMP'S PARDON.

41
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,310
IT

42
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,429
WAS PERFECTLY FINE, THERE WAS
NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.

43
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:51,429
BUT WE

44
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:54,971
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE FUN
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PASS UP AN

45
00:01:54,971 --> 00:02:00,100
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING BACK THE
LEGENDARY SARAH PALIN PARDONING

46
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,270
OF A TURKEY THAT WENT
DISASTROUSLY WRONG, AND

47
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,039
AFTERWARDS I WILL READ YOU SOME
GREAT TWEETS ON THE TRUMP PARDON

48
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:06,469
OF THE TURKEY.

49
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:07,469
BUT REMEMBER THIS
MOMENT?

50
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,469
SHE GOES TO PARDON A

51
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,280
TURKEY AND DOESN'T NOTICE WHAT
IS HAPPENING IN THE BACKGROUND

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,090
WHICH IS DECIDEDLY NOT PARDONING
A TURKEY, WATCH.

53
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,480
THANKFULLY WE ARE IN A GOOD
POSITION STILL FISCALLY

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
SPEAKING.

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,500
ACCOUNTING FOR THAT, ALL THAT
COMES INTO PLAY NOW AT $50

56
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,660
A BARREL OIL.

57
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,980
ESPECIALLY WITH SO MUCH THAT
HAS GONE ON IN THE LAST COUPLE

58
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,770
OF MONTHS THAT HAS BEEN SO
POLITICAL, OBVIOUSLY --

59
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,760
HEAVY-HANDED POLITICS THAT
INVITES CRITICISM, CERTAINLY

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,910
WILL PROBABLY INVITE CRITICISM
FOR EVEN DOING THIS TOO BUT

61
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,150
AT LEAST THIS WAS FUN.

62
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,460
I'LL BE IN CHARGE OF THE
TURKEY.

63
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,460
I'M WHERE I NEED TO BE

64
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,910
TODAY TO PREPARE FOR THAT.

65
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,610
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PART OF THAT
VIDEO I LOVE MOST.

66
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,030
IS IT THE

67
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,760
TURKEY GOING THROUGH THE GRINDER
IN THE BACKGROUND?

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
AND I'M

69
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,630
SORRY, FOR ALL YOU VEGANS, SHE'S
LIKE I'M HERE TO PARDON A

70
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,720
TURKEY, I WILL PROBABLY EVEN GET
CRITICIZED FOR THIS.

71
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
MEANWHILE

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,310
THE TURKEY IS TWITCHING IN THE
BACKGROUND -- YOU PROBABLY WILL

73
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,600
GET CRITICIZED FOR THAT BECAUSE
YOU ARE A KNUCKLEHEAD.

74
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,700
OR THE

75
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:21,770
GUY WHO KEEPS LOOKING BACK --
YES, DUDE, YOU ARE IN THE VIDEO.

76
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:28,350
NOW BACK TO TRUMP, MATT FULLER
WITH A GREAT TWEET, IMITATING

77
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:40,260
TRUMP AFTER THE 
PARDON --

78
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:50,670
ELON GALE WITH ANOTHER GREAT
ONE, WRITING IN --

79
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:59,930
I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T NAME
IT LAVAR.

80
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,930
AND FINALLY THIS ONE

81
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,680
--

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,490
NICE TRY, MIKE FLYNN.

83
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:12,180
[LAUGHTER] AH, THIS IS TOO MUCH

84
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,180
FUN.

85
00:04:13,180 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT IMPORTANT, JUST FUN,
WE'RE MOVING ON.
