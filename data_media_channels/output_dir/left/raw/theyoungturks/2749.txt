1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,070
THE SECRETARY OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,590
TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF CONGRESS
AND BOY, SHE HAD SOME

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,140
INTERESTING AND AMUSING EXCUSES
FOR DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,140
HER

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,600
NAME IS KIRSTJEN NIELSEN AND SHE
WAS QUESTIONED BY A LOT OF THE

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,640
SENATORS, MANY OF WHOM WERE
FRUSTRATED.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
LET'S START WITH

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,060
DICK DURBIN WHO WAS IN THE
INFAMOUS MEETING WERE DONALD

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,900
TRUMP MADE THE SHITHOLE
COMMENTS, AND DURBIN IS THE ONE

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,909
WHO CALLED HIM OUT ON IT IN THE
FIRST PLACE, WHERE THE PRESIDENT

11
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:30,050
CALLED HAITI, SOMEWHAT IN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AND ALL OF

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,220
THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES SHITHOLES.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,290
HERE IS THE EXCHANGE BACK AND
FORTH.

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,000
>>WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER THE
PRESIDENT SAYING ABOUT

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,670
IMMIGRATION FROM AFRICAN
COUNTRIES TO THE UNITED STATES?

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,290
>>WHAT I HEARD HIM SAYING WAS
THAT HE'D LIKE TO MOVE AWAY FROM

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,740
A COUNTRY-BASED QUOTA SYSTEM TO
A MERIT-BASED SYSTEM, IT

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,100
SHOULDN'T MATTER WHERE YOU'RE
FROM, IT SHOULD MATTER WHAT YOU

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,080
CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNITED
STATES.

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,000
>>HOW DID HE CHARACTERIZE THOSE
COUNTRIES IN AFRICA?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,440
>>I DON'T SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER
A CATEGORIZATION OF COUNTRIES IN

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
AFRICA.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,500
I THINK WHAT HE WAS
SAYING, AS BEST I COULD TELL AND

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,170
AS YOU KNOW THERE WERE ABOUT A
DOZEN PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, THERE

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,999
WERE A LOT OF CROSS
CONVERSATIONS, THERE WAS A

26
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:15,320
LOT OF ROUGH TALK BY A LOT OF
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, BUT

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,770
WHAT I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO BE
SAYING WAS LET'S MOVE AWAY

28
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,869
FROM THE COUNTRIES AND LET'S
LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND MAKE

29
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,930
SURE THAT THOSE WE BRING HERE
CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY.

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,439
>>WHAT I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO BE
SAYING -- NOT WHAT HE SAID --

31
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,310
WHAT I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO BE
SAYING IS LET'S LOOK AWAY FROM

32
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,740
THE COUNTRIES AND LOOK AT THE
INDIVIDUALS.

33
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,789
BUT HE DIDN'T

34
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,899
ACTUALLY SAY THAT AT ALL, IN
FACT HE SAID THE OPPOSITE.

35
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:37,899
HE

36
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,499
SAID WHY ARE WE LETTING THESE
COUNTRIES IN, WHICH HE DESCRIBED

37
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,609
AS SHITHOLE COUNTRIES, AND HE
SAID ABOUT THE HAITIANS TAKE

38
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:47,390
THEM OUT. AND HE SAID WHEN WE
LET IN PEOPLE FROM NORWAY?

39
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,979
THAT'S NOT PERSON BASED OR
MERIT-BASED, IT'S COUNTRY-BASED.

40
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,500
I LIKE NORWEGIANS, I DON'T LIKE
OTHER COUNTRIES, LET'S LET THOSE

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,539
GUYS IN.

42
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,039
SHE SAID I DON'T
SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER WHAT HE

43
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,749
SAID WHEN HE WAS TALKING HIS
ROUGH TALK.

44
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,749
NOW YOU KNOW THE

45
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:07,569
CUES THEY ARE USING, RIGHT?

46
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,770
THE
PRESIDENT DIDN'T NECESSARILY SAY

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,590
SHITHOLE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S FAKE
NEWS.

48
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,590
HE MIGHT HAVE JUST SAID

49
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,590
SHITHOUSE.

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,760
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING?

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
THAT SOUND LOVELY.

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,980
MORE OF THIS
NONSENSE.

53
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,030
>>DO YOU REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT
SAYING WHY CAN'T WE HAVE MORE

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,570
IMMIGRANTS FROM NORWAY?

55
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:31,620
>>I REMEMBER HIM ASKING ABOUT
THE CONCEPT OF UNDERREPRESENTED

56
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,400
COUNTRIES AS A FIX, THIS WAS IN
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT REMOVING

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,350
THE DIVERSITY LOTTERY, AND HOW
WE CAN REALLOCATE THAT, AND I DO

58
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,960
REMEMBER HIM ASKING IF WE DO
THAT AND WE THEN ASSIGN THOSE

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,430
TO COUNTRIES THAT ARE
UNREPRESENTED, WE JUST

60
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,970
CONTINUING ON MERIT-BASED
IMMIGRATION?

61
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,530
>>THE LAST PART GETS UNDER MY
SKIN.

62
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,530
UNDERREPRESENTED COUNTRIES

63
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,040
-- AND NORWAY DOES HAVE FAR
GREATER WEALTH THAN, FOR

64
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,920
EXAMPLE, HAITI, OF COURSE THAT'S
TRUE.

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
BUT PART OF THE REASON WE

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,180
DON'T HAVE AS MANY IMMIGRANTS
COMING IN FROM NORWAY IS BECAUSE

67
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,370
THEY ARE DOING FINE IN NORWAY.

68
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,540
THEY HAD UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, A

69
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,340
MORE PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT,
THEY ARE GENERALLY WAY HAPPIER

70
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,230
FROM HERE, THAT'S BASED ON
ACTUAL STUDIES, NORTHERN

71
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,900
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE GENERALLY
PRETTY HAPPY.

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,220
THEY ARE ALSO

73
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,370
OVERALL ASTOUNDINGLY LIBERAL, SO
THEY DON'T WANT TO COME HERE TO

74
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,350
THIS DRACONIAN SYSTEM WHERE WE
HAVE THE FREE MARKET RUN AMOK

75
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,370
WITH NO REGULATIONS, ETC., AND
GREAT WEALTH DISPARITY.

76
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,370
THAT'S

77
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,890
PART OF THE REASON WE AREN'T AS
HAPPY AS NORTHERN EUROPE.

78
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,890
WHEN

79
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,260
THE IRISH CAME OVER TO AMERICA
THEY DIDN'T COME BECAUSE THEY

80
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,750
ARE LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT,
EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT IN

81
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,120
IRELAND, WE ARE ALL REALLY RICH,
DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE OUR

82
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,730
MANSIONS AND GO TO AMERICA?

83
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,340
NO,
THEY WERE DYING, THERE WAS THE

84
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,170
POTATO FAMINE, THEY LOOKED FOR A
NEW HOPE AND CAME TO AMERICA.

85
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,170
IF

86
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:08,340
WE SAY WE WANT A MERIT-BASED
SYSTEM, MERIT-BASED ON WHAT?

87
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,340
THE

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:19,190
IRISH AND ITALIANS AND JEWS AND
BLACKS AND LATINOS HAVE BEEN

89
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,580
TERRIFIC FOR AMERICA AND BUILD
AMERICA, A LOT OF THEM WITH

90
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,700
THEIR BARE HANDS, AND THEY
DIDN'T COME BECAUSE THEY WERE

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,710
ALREADY RICH.

92
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,790
WHAT OTHER MERIT
WOULD USE?

93
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,790
THE S.A.T.S?

94
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,130
AN I.Q.

95
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,130
TEST?

96
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,610
WE'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

97
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,930
GIVE US YOUR HUDDLED MASSES.

98
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,550
THEY MADE AMERICA GREAT BECAUSE
THEY WERE HUNGRY TO DO BETTER,

99
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,220
IN CASE OF THE IRISH LITERALLY,
THERE WAS A FAMINE GOING ON.

100
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,220
SO

101
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,930
THIS WHOLE IDEA OF A MERIT-BASED
SYSTEM, IT MEANS LET'S LET

102
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,889
RICH WHITE PEOPLE IN,
THAT'S GROSS.

103
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,350
THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICA IS.

104
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,970
WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVEN TO
FIND A BETTER LIFE AND LIVE

105
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,280
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

106
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
ONE MORE FROM HER.

107
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,090
>>YOU SAID ON FOX NEWS THAT THE
PRESIDENT USED STRONG LANGUAGE,

108
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,510
WAS THAT STRONG LANGUAGE?

109
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,180
>>LET'S SEE.

110
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,100
STRONG LANGUAGE,
THERE WAS -- APOLOGIES, I DON'T

111
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,680
REMEMBER A SPECIFIC WORD.

112
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,520
WHAT I
WAS STRUCK WITH AS I'M SURE YOU

113
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,630
WERE AS WELL WAS JUST THE
GENERAL PROFANITY THAT WAS USED

114
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,440
IN THE ROOM BY ALMOST EVERYONE.

115
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,040
>>DID YOU HEAR ME USE
PROFANITY?

116
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,100
>>NO SIR, NEITHER DID I.

117
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,230
>>DID YOU HEAR SENATOR GRAHAM
USE PROFANITY?

118
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,639
>>I HEARD TOUGH LANGUAGE FROM
SENATOR GRAHAM, YES SIR.

119
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,470
>>WHAT DID HE SAY?

120
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,370
>>HE WAS IMPASSIONED, TO
UNDERSCORE A POINT I THINK HE

121
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,870
USED SOME STRONG LANGUAGE.

122
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,790
>>DO YOU CALL THAT THE STRONG
LANGUAGE HE USED REPEATED

123
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,980
EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD
SAID PRIOR TO THAT?

124
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,610
>>I REMEMBER SPECIFIC CUSS
WORDS BEING USED BY A

125
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,780
VARIETY OF MEMBERS.

126
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,710
>>JUST SAY IT.

127
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,400
WHAT DOES ROUGH
TALK MEAN?

128
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,060
WHAT IS THE

129
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,940
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHITHOLE AND
SHITHOUSE?

130
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,940
ROUGH TALK ISN'T

131
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,000
LIKE, BOY, I AM VEXED.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,430
IT'S NOT
LIKE, I ROUGH TALK THEM AND RUN

133
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,150
THEM OFF.

134
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,520
OLD SCHOOL TYT
REFERENCE, GIT, GIT!

135
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
NO, THAT

136
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,110
MEANS CURSE WORDS LIKE SHITHOLE.

137
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,560
I THOUGHT CONSERVATIVES WERE

138
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
REAL TOUGH GUYS.

139
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,320
OH, WE ARE
GOING TO CALL IT LIKE IT IS, WE

140
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,000
LIKE TRUMP BECAUSE HE TELLS IT
LIKE IT IS.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ALL OF A SUDDEN I

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,580
GUESS HE'S SCARED, I GUESS
THAT'S YOUR BIG BOLD LEADER.

143
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,530
THEY ADMIT IT WAS ROUGH TALK,
YOU KNOW HE'S CURSING,

144
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,580
DENIGRATING, PUTTING THEM DOWN,
I GUESS THEY ARE TOO SCARED TO

145
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,360
SAY THE ACTUAL WORDS.

146
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,940
WHAT
HAPPENED, I THOUGHT YOU WERE

147
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
TOUGH GUYS?

148
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
NO.

149
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,960
HE WANTS CREDIT
FROM HIS BASE BUT DOESN'T WANT

150
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,120
IT FOR ANYBODY ELSE.

151
00:06:56,120 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT SOUND
LIKE A STANDARD POLITICIAN.
