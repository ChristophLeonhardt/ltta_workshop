CHINESE ABOUT THAT. THERE WILL BE CHINESE ABOUT THAT. THERE WILL BE NEAR AND LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. HEATHER: THE PENTAGON CALLING ON THE CHINESE DO INCIDENT DIVISION INVESTIGATE THESE INCIDENTS. HE RAN FIRING BACK AT DONALD TRUMP'S THREAD TO PULL OUT OF THE OBAMA ERA NUCLEAR AGREEMENT. THE TOP DIPLOMAT IN TEHRAN SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE WHITE HOUSE, ONE WEEK BEFORE THE DEADLINE TO RECERTIFY THE DEAL. THE US HAS CONSISTENTLY VIOLATED THE AGREEMENT, ESPECIALLY BY BULLYING OTHERS FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN. WE NEED TO OUTSOURCE OUR SECURITY, NOR WILL WE RENEGOTIATE OR ADD ON TO A DEED WE HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED. HEATHER: WHAT HAPPENS NOW? JOINING ME IS RYAN MORROW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE APPRECIATE IT. NOT ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED. IRAN NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS. THE US PULLING OUT AND SAYING THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PLAY GAMES. WHAT ELSE IS NEW? THE IRANIAN REGIME IS WHINING AGAIN. WHAT THEIR STRATEGY WAS, THEY HOPE TO MAKE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM OIL DEALS AND OTHER DEALS WITH INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE DEAL DID HAPPEN YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP IN THERE NOW, MIKE POMPEO AND BOLTON WHO HAVE THEIR EYE ON STOPPING THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM ALTOGETHER THE STATE SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM AND EVEN KILLING THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION ALTOGETHER SO IT IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT BUSINESSES DON'T WANT TO ENTER CONTRACT WITH THE LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. BILL: HAVE THE UN, OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES ALL SAYING, TELLING DONALD TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION TO STAY IN THE DEAL. THEY ARE BUT ALSO SAYING THEY WANT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL DEMANDS, SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT TO THE CURRENT DEAL. I DON'T THINK THERE'S AS MUCH DISTANCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE AS IT APPEARS AND BEHIND THE BLUSTER, YOU SEE FEAR ON THE PART OF THE IRANIAN REGIME ESPECIALLY WITH NORTH KOREA, THEY KNOW A LOT OF THOSE NUCLEAR SECRETS AND IF NORTH KOREA IS RUNNING SCARED THE IRANIAN REGIME SHOULD BE AS WELL. DIANE: NORTH KOREA WATCHING WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE IRANI AND DEAL AND HOW THAT IS HANDLED, THEY WERE LISTENING TO BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT SPIES THAT WENT IN, BRINGING OUT INFORMATION THAT CONFIRMED THEY WERE NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE DEAL. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS? I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE NEXT MOVE. IF THEY DON'T TRY TO RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL, AS ANGRY AS THEY ARE, THEY COULD GET SANCTIONS AND ARE VULNERABLE TO INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS EVEN IF PEOPLE TRY TO BLAME TRUMP FOR WHATEVER DIPLOMATIC CONFLICT ARISES OR MAKE A MAD DASH TOWARDS NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHICH WOULD BE A BAD RESULT FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO REALIZE THE ISRAELIS AND AMERICANS AND OTHERS PENETRATED THE MOST COVETED SECRETS OF THE IRANI AND REGIME AND SAY I PROBABLY GOT A SPY BEHIND ME WATCHING ME RIGHT NOW. JOHN: THE TO LISTEN TO THEM THEY ARE NOT BACKING DOWN. THIS IS WHAT A TOP URANIAN DIPLOMAT HAD TO SAY. TO PUT IT IN REAL ESTATE TERMS, WHEN YOU BUY HOUSE AND MOVE YOUR FAMILY IN IT OR DEMOLISH IT TO BUILD A SKYSCRAPER YOU CANNOT COME BACK 20 YEARS LATER AND RENEGOTIATE THE PRICE. THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE TERMS WHEN ISRAEL HAS PROOF THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE TERMS WHICH WAS SUSPECTED ALL ALONG. TYPICAL PROPAGANDA FROM THE IRANI REGIME TO ENGAGE IN WITTY BANTER BECAUSE THESE 1-LINERS HAPPEN NOWADAYS. THEY ARE BAD AT IT AND THAT IS WHAT WORKED FOR THEM IN THE PAST. IT WILL NOT WORK ANYMORE. THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AS WEAK CLOWNS WAS ALL DO RESPECT THEY ARE A THREAT, BUT LET'S NOT OVERESTIMATE IT AND APPRECIATE OUR POSITION OF STRENGTH. HEATHER: AS NORTH KOREA SEEMS TO
