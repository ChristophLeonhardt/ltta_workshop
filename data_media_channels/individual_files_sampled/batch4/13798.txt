one of the things that I've been just fascinated by in the trumpet I'm always I'm always fascinated by the press obviously I'm always fascinated by the media because I'm a storyteller and I'm watching them tell stories and I'm watching the way those stories do set the agenda for what we're talking about and one of the things that's been so fascinating about Donald Trump is that he manipulates the media he under because he's a media guy he manipulates them so expertly not always in ways that I like but he forces them to cover the things that they would bury so you know they made fun of him for attacking or making fun of Christine Ford but he swen out there and talked about the fact that she didn't remember things very conveniently and remembered things conveniently and they said he's mocking her but in order to attack him they also had to report what was true was that she didn't remember a lot of details that would have been able would have made the story possible to check but she did remember a lot of details that condemn Brett Kavanaugh so it was kind of suspicious and he brought that he forced them to cover that yesterday or the day before when he called stormy Daniels horse face he forced them to cover the fact that he had won the lawsuit so Michael avenatti for all his big talk and all his swaggering around and all CNN made him a big you know made him a big hero he's not he's obviously not very good at what he does you know he actually put her in a situation where she was humiliated and he by being Reuter just forced them to do that because they hate him so much you can actually watch the news process go wrong this is the thing that fascinates me you can actually watch the news you know how they say you don't like to see the sausage being made you can actually watch the news go into the grinder and come out crap
