1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:00,938
NEGATIVE REACTION.

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:06,844
TARIFFS IN JULY.

3
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:08,345
>> Bret: KEVIN CORKE OF THE

4
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:12,650
POLITICS AND THE OTHER STORIES

5
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:14,285
OF THE DAY.

6
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:16,387
BRIT HUME IS HERE TONIGHT.

7
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:18,656
JUST BEFORE WE CAME OUT HERE,

8
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:21,225
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT THE

9
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:21,525
STORY.

10
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:22,226
SURPRISED THAT HARLEY-DAVIDSON

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,597
I FOUGHT HARD FOR THEM AND

12
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:27,798
ULTIMATELY THEY WILL NOT PAY

13
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:30,401
TARIFFS SELLING INTO THE E.U.,

14
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:34,205
WHICH HAS FOR US BADLY ON TRADE.

15
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:42,780
THOUGHTS ON THAT?

16
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:46,617
>> I WOULD INTERPRET "BE

17
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:48,786
PATIENT," JUST LET THIS GO FOR A

18
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:49,720
WHILE HARLEY-DAVIDSON, DON'T DO

19
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:50,221
ANYTHING.

20
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:51,789
I THINK WE WILL GET A DEAL OUT

21
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,724
OF THAT AND EVERYONE WILL BE

22
00:00:55,994 --> 00:00:57,862
AND IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY CLEAR

23
00:00:57,863 --> 00:00:59,597
WHAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDERWAY.

24
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:00,831
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE

25
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:02,233
PRESIDENT'S DESIRE TO TAMP THIS

26
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,635
DOWN BECAUSE IT IS AN

27
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:05,168
EMBARRASSING RESULT.

28
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,103
>> Bret: BUT ON THE BIG

29
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:07,505
PICTURE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS

30
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:24,255
DOES IT PAY OFF DOWN THE ROAD?

31
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:24,955
>> THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT HAS

32
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:25,689
BEDEVILED TRADING NATIONS FOR AS

33
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,357
LONG AS THERE HAS BEEN SUCH

34
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:26,690
THINGS.

35
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:27,391
NATIONS ENGAGED IN AN UNFAIR

36
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:27,858
TRADE PRACTICE.

37
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,795
TARIFFS THEMSELVES COULD BE

38
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:31,962
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE.

39
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:34,865
THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR

40
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:36,433
ECONOMIES AND THEIR

41
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:37,401
DISADVANTAGES OF OTHERS, AND

42
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:38,202
IT'S NOT FAIR.

43
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:42,673
WE HAVE A SET OF RULES TO BE

44
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:51,415
IT TAKES TOO LONG AND IT'S TOO

45
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:51,849
BUREAUCRATIC.

46
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,152
THAT LEAVES YOU WITH WHAT OTHER

47
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:55,653
WEAPON IN HAND?

48
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:56,587
TARIFFS.

49
00:01:56,588 --> 00:02:01,792
SO IN A SENSE, YOU END UP

50
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:02,493
FIGHTING TRADE PRACTICES WITH

51
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:03,260
TARIFFS.

52
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:04,795
NOW TARIFFS CAN BE EFFECTIVE AND

53
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,233
AND IF YOU TRIGGER A TRADE WAR

54
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:12,436
IN WHICH YOU GO TIT FOR TAT,

55
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:13,704
TIT FOR TAT, PRETTY SOON YOU

56
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:15,306
HAVE A BIGGER THAN THE NATION

57
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,841
SITUATION GOING ON LIKE WE HAD

58
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,242
DURING THE DEPRESSION AND

59
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:19,276
EVERYBODY LOSES.

60
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:20,477
THAT'S THE DANGER, THE PRESIDENT

61
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:21,478
MAKE IT DEALS OUT OF THIS AND IT

62
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,848
MAY WORK BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE

63
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,817
ABOUT IT, IS PLAYING WITH FIRE.

64
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:31,622
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE

65
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:32,790
STABILITY STORY.

66
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,993
YOU HEARD CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE

67
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:37,595
WATERS WALKING BACK YOUR

68
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,599
AND GET IN THEIR FACE AFTER THE

69
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,634
SARAH SANDERS INCIDENT OVER THE

70
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,640
PLAY WELL WITH THE PUBLIC AT

71
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:51,408
LARGE NO MATTER YOUR POLITICAL

72
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:51,809
AFFILIATION.

73
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,210
BUT IT DOES EXEMPLIFY THE

74
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:54,245
EXTREMES TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE

75
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:55,579
GOING AND THE EXTREMES TO WHICH

76
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,314
PEOPLE ARE FEELING IN REACTION

77
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:59,216
TO THIS PRESIDENT.

78
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,685
I'M NOT SAYING IT IS HIS FAULT

79
00:03:01,686 --> 00:03:02,820
BUT PEOPLE RESPONDING TO THEM IN

80
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:03,821
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WAY.

81
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:06,123
EVERY TIME HE DOES OR SAYS

82
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:09,426
SOMETHING, WHAT HAPPENS IS,

83
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:10,594
EXTRAPOLATING FROM HIS SOMETIMES

84
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,463
NOT VERY CLEAR LANGUAGE, PEOPLE

85
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,634
DOING OR TRYING TO DO AND REACTS

86
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:17,801
TO THEM ACCORDINGLY.

87
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:18,903
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU ARE

88
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,576
I DON'T THINK IT WILL PLAY VERY

89
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:27,444
WELL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

90
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:28,245
MAXINE WATERS WAS TALKING ABOUT

91
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:35,819
IS HARMFUL.

92
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,288
IT'S NOT PHYSICAL HARM BUT IT'S

93
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:37,788
HARM NONETHELESS.

94
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:40,724
I THINK SHE WILL BE QUIETED BY

95
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,226
HER COLLEAGUES.

96
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:44,228
>> Bret: AND OBVIOUSLY THE

97
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,696
PRESIDENT HAS A HISTORY OF BEING

98
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,531
A COUNTER PUNCH HER, HE TWEETED

99
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:51,402
OUT, YOU MAY NOT BE HAPPY WITH

100
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:52,503
WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR.

101
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:55,239
>> RIGHT WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY

102
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,640
TAKEN AS A VEILED THREAT.

103
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,242
A THREAT TO DO WHAT?

104
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:01,879
OVER AGAIN.

105
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,447
WE NEED TO STOP ALL THIS AND

106
00:04:03,448 --> 00:00:00,000
BEGIN TO BEHAVE IN A CIVILIZED
