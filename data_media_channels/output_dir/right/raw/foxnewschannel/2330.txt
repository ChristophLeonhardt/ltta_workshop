I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT

93
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:14,866
DESERVES A TON OF CREDIT FOR

94
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:15,767

WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO SAY

100
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,776

00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:26,144

GENERAL JUST SAID.

106
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:31,750
WE VIEW EVERYTHING WITH

107
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,650
SKEPTICISM WHEN IT COMES TO

108
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,384
KIM JONG UN.

109
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,854
