one of the biggest issues in the 2016 election was the fact that many young voters decided to sit this one out they didn't go to the polls they didn't vote and I can understand that I mean there was a lot of terrible things happening during that election on the Democratic side you had people who were outraged over what happened to Bernie Sanders and then on the Republican side you had Trump and so people felt uncomfortable voting and I completely understand that but the midterms are coming and this is an incredibly important election and so there are various ad campaigns out there to encourage young people to go out and vote to register and then go out to vote so one of the ads that stood out to me was by knock the vote and what it did was feature the generation that is very politically active usually always votes and just take a look at what they did in order to encourage young people to go to the polls dear young people don't vote don't vote anything's fine the way it is termed that was us he's our guy tax cuts for the rich hell yeah all right climate change that's a you problem I'll be dead soon sure school shootings are sad but I haven't been in a school for 50 years I can't keep track of which lives matter sure you don't like yourself you'll like some meme on Instagram if the weather is nice maybe you could go to one of those little marches you might even share this video on Facebook you young people never do but I do I do I do midterms primaries every single election will be there about you oats because we're a generation of doers not whiners we're doing great that was amazing so as I was watching that it's funny cuz look I know I know that this is an ad campaign to encourage young people to vote I know those are actors but it like started making me angry like I registered to vote obviously I'm gonna vote but if I was not planning to that would I don't know it would encourage me to do is to do so absolutely and something like I'm going to be a poll person and I've done it before and so you're looking for something fun to do it is very fun to do it you to meet a lot of people hangout sees in the neighborhood it's a way to socialize also do your civic duty and you get to vote while you're there so I recommend it to anybody exactly and also depending on what state you're in there are ballot initiatives that you should be aware of I mean local politics matter we talked about national level politics quite a bit but just figure out what's going on in your state because those ballot measures do matter they're complicated I know that there's a lot of like false advertising regarding either side of any issue but those are the issues that will impact your day to day so be aware of those things go out there and just educate yourself just be aware of what's happening there's nothing sexy about apathy and I like you complain a lot right we complain a lot so taking I did a little sexy like when you're younger and then there's like that cool guy in class right now but yeah when the guy ignores you and you like them more the thing is that I i I did hear a lot of people say you know they're both the both parties are corrupt and both parties are this you know what even though that is the case that that state that that a prosecutor in Florida is gone with regards to that Trayvon Martin case because people voted them out so if if you don't realize how impactful local politics are for you on your data in your day to day life you black and brown people I'm gonna make my own campaign right now it shouldn't take a whole bunch of all white people to tell you not to vote when your great-great great-great grandparents fought and died for the rights of both so just on the strength of that exercise your vote and let's get these people out of here yeah exactly so again I know that they're all actors and actresses but like it's kind of weird right like the one woman who mentioned climate change yeah like I don't care I'm gonna die soon yeah we got like man that is that is a hard thing to it's a very real thing you know the fact is that often people voter they make decisions on what is most significant to them and what's gonna impact them and so you do have this class and generation of people who they care about certain issues that may not be our focus and that generally are not our focus so is if you essentially want our future to be decided and to be geared toward a direction of something that doesn't serve you it's like keep doing you but if you actually want to have people in power who want to do things that serve you you need to go to the ballot box Oh exactly and that man with the tweed jacket is not rich AF thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a TYT member today for more exclusive content join now at TYT dot-com /join
