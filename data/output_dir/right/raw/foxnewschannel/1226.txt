>>  WITH REPUBLICAN CLOUT

2
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:14,799
RAPIDLY FADING IN CALIFORNIA,

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,434
THE FAILURE TO HAVE ANY GENERAL

4
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,702
ELECTION CANDIDATES FOR THE

5
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:19,904
SENATE AP GOVERNOR'S RACES IS A

6
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:21,806
VERY REAL POSSIBILITY AND COULD

7
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:24,942
PROVE DISASTROUS FOR THE

8
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,845
G.O.P.'S FUTURE IN THE STATE AND

9
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:28,713
POTENTIALLY THE

10
00:00:28,713 --> 00:00:29,580
G.O.P.-CONTROLLED CONGRESS IN

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,514
WASHINGTON.

12
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:32,383
CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY IS TUESDAY.

13
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:35,119
IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE TOP TWO

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,287
CANDIDATES ADVANCE REGARDLESS OF

15
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:36,621
PARTY.

16
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,889
THE JUNGLE PRIMARY IT'S CALLED.

17
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:39,757
REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE OF

18
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:41,926
THE POLLS THERE AND THOSE ARE

19
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:45,663
CURRENTLY THE STATE'S DEMOCRATIC

20
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,666
LT. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOME AND

21
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,601
REPUBLICAN BUSINESSMAN JOHN COX,

22
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:51,936
ONE AND TWO.

23
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:54,005
JOHN COX JOINING US FROM SAN

24
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,140
DIEGO AND PROESH IT.

25
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,443
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, LELAND,

26
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:00,011
THANK YOU.

27
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,079
LELAND: HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,715
ABOUT KEEPING REPUBLICANS

29
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:06,117
RELEVANT, MUCH LESS TRYING TO

30
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:06,984
WIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE?

31
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,020
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE FORGET

32
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,023
THAT IN CALIFORNIA, WE'VE HAD A

33
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:13,758
SUCCESSION OF REPUBLICAN

34
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:14,158
GOVERNORS.

35
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,259
YOU GO BACK TO RONALD REAGAN IN

36
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:19,430
THE '60S AND PETE WILSON AND

37
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,064
GEORGE, AND ARNOLD

38
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:21,632
SCHWARZENEGGER, AND WE'VE

39
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:22,633
ELECTED A LOT OF REPUBLICAN

40
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,902
GOVERNORS HERE, YOU KNOW, JERRY

41
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,971
BROWN, AS A MATTER OF FACT, IS

42
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,706
THE ONLY DEMOCRAT.

43
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,608
GRAY DAVIS, YOU KNOW, WAS

44
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,610
ELECTED AS A DEMOCRAT AND THEN

45
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,912
WAS RECALLED, SO PEOPLE--

46
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:38,749
>> I UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY

47
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:40,885
HILLARY CLINTON WON THAT STATE.

48
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:41,452
>> SHE DID.

49
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:44,822
LELAND: YOU'RE FIGHTING AN

50
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:45,790
UPHILL BATTLE, FAIR TO SAY?

51
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,058
>> YES, EXCEPT WHAT THE

52
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:48,626
DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IN THIS

53
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:50,294
STATE, THEY'VE OVERREACHED.

54
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:51,762
CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST TAX

55
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,698
BURDEN IN THE COUNTRY, THE

56
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,199
HIGHEST POVERTY RATE, OUR ROADS,

57
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,534
OUR SCHOOLS ARE A MESS.

58
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,235
WATER HAS BEEN UNAVAILABLE FOR

59
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:00,638
FARMERS AND FOR PEOPLE, OUR

60
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:03,174
EDUCATION SYSTEM SPENDS HUGE

61
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:04,608
AMOUNTS AND HAS POOR RESULTS.

62
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:07,445
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE

63
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:11,549
WANT A BUSINESSMAN IN THE

64
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,517
GOVERNOR'S MANSION JUST LIKE WE

65
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,653
HAVE A BUSINESSMAN IN THE WHITE

66
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:15,986
HOUSE.

67
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:18,723
I THINK THAT'S THE DEFINING

68
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:21,025
ISSUE HERE.

69
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:23,394
NEWSOME IS AN ELITIST AND WAY

70
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:23,861
LEFT--

71
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:26,330
>> YOU'VE GOT THE PRESIDENT'S

72
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,033
ENDORSEMENT AND GAVIN NEWSOME

73
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,602
WANTS SINGLE PAYER HEALTH CARE

74
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:32,236
IN YOUR STATE.

75
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,637
THE PROBLEM IS FUNDAMENTAL.

76
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:35,473
IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE IN THAT

77
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:37,074
YOU ARE WHAT THE PEOPLE OF

78
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,542
CALIFORNIA WANT, WHY IS IT WHEN

79
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,544
I TALK TO REPUBLICAN DONORS,

80
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:41,445
INCLUDING BIG TOP REPUBLICAN

81
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,447
DONOR IN CALIFORNIA, HE SAYS HE

82
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,382
FEELS LIKE THIS IS SORT OF AN

83
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,951
EXERCISE IN FUTILITY AND IT'S

84
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,019
MORE ABOUT TRYING TO PRESERVE

85
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,489
REPUBLICAN LEGACY AND PRESERVING

86
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:52,757
SPOTS FOR REPUBLICANS AND

87
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,558
REPUBLICANS TURNOUTS FARTHER

88
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:55,126
DOWN BALLOT?

89
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:57,128
>> THIS IS THE MEDIA INFLUENCE

90
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:57,495
HERE.

91
00:02:57,495 --> 00:02:59,463
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY

92
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:00,831
TO IT, LELAND.

93
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,533
IT'S FAKE NEWS, THEY THINK THAT

94
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,368
DEMOCRATS ARE INVINCIBLE.

95
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:06,103
I'M HERE TOLE IT YOU THAT THE

96
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,538
MIDDLE CLASS IN THE STATE IS

97
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:08,639
ALMOST NONEXISTENT.

98
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,040
WORKING PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD A

99
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,374
HOUSE.

100
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,642
THE GAS TAX IS THE BIGGEST

101
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:12,743
THING, LELAND.

102
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:15,179
THIS GAS TAX HAS RESULTED IN

103
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:18,315
PEOPLE BEING PUSHED INTO THE

104
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:19,350
POVERTY RANKS.

105
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,585
GAS IT NOW OVER $4 A GALLON.

106
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:23,721
AND PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, HAVE HAD

107
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:25,656
TO MOVE FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY

108
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:26,657
FROM THEIR JOB BECAUSE OF THE

109
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:29,293
COST OF HOUSING AND THEN GET HIT

110
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,862
WITH THIS GAS TAX, INSTEAD OF

111
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:34,398
REFORMING CAL TRANS, WHICH IS

112
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:35,900
FULL OF WASTE AND CORRUPTION.

113
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,768
I REALLY BELIEVE, LELAND, THE

114
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:38,636
VOTERS OF THE STATE.

115
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,304
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE MODERATE

116
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,439
DEMOCRATS OR INDEPENDENTS, THEY

117
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,641
WANT CHANGE.

118
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,975
THEY ARE SICK OF THE CORRUPTION

119
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,010
IN SACRAMENTO.

120
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,444
THEY REALLY WANT TO HAVE AN

121
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:48,112
AFFORDABLE LIFE.

122
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,547
THEY DOESN'T WANT TO WORK TWO

123
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:49,880
JOBS.

124
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,816
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, UNEMPLOYMENT'S

125
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,517
PRETTY LOW HERE, BUT PEOPLE ARE

126
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:54,718
WORKING TWO AND SOMETIMES THREE

127
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,387
JOBS IN ORDER TO MAKE A LIVING.

128
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:57,388
LELAND: THAT BRINGS UP AN

129
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:58,189
IMPORTANT POINT.

130
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,157
WE SAW THE JOB NUMBERS COME OUT

131
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,392
YESTERDAY AND WE SAW PRESIDENT

132
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,159
TRUMP TOUT THEM.

133
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,294
THESE ARE RECORD LOW

134
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:03,861
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS.

135
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:04,195
>> YES.

136
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,596
LELAND: AS YOU POINT OUT, SO

137
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,031
MANY PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO

138
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:08,465
GET BY.

139
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,533
HOW DO REPUBLICANS ANSWER THAT

140
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,669
AND PUT THAT TOGETHER?

141
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,806
>> LOWER THE COST OF LIVING.

142
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,241
I BUILT APARTMENTS FOR A LIVING

143
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,510
AND BUILT THEM FOR $80,000 A

144
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,245
UNIT IN INDIANA.

145
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,714
IT'S 500,000, AND 700,000 HERE,

146
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:24,748
AND WHY?

147
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:26,350
GOVERNMENT.

148
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,552
IT'S NOT THE COST OF LAND.

149
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:31,055
IT'S GOVERNMENT REGULATION, IT'S

150
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:32,756
LITIGATION, IT'S APPROVALS AND

151
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:33,123
DELAYS.

152
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:34,625
THAT'S WHAT ENDS UP IN THE PRICE

153
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,726
OF A HOUSE.

154
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:38,128
AND THAT'S THE LARGEST SINGLE

155
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:40,664
COST TO ANY FAMILY AND IT'S

156
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:42,566
DRIVING PEOPLE INTO POVERTY.

157
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,134
THEY CAN'T SAVE MONEY OR PROVIDE

158
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,202
FOR THEIR FAMILIES.

159
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,303
THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE.

160
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:48,205
LELAND: WELL, MR. COX, MUCH LIKE

161
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:52,676
A BUSINESSMAN, UP AGAINST A HARD

162
00:04:52,676 --> 00:00:00,000
LINE OR A
