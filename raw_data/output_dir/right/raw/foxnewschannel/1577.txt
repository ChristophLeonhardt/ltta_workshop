WHAT THEY WERE DOING FOR 1 1/2

YEARS AND THE DEEP STATE REAL,

33
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:56,617
FISA ABUSES REAL, SPIES IN THE

34
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:57,752
TRUMP CAMPAIGN ARE REAL.

35
00:00:57,752 --> 00:00:59,954
YOU'RE THE GREAT HISTORIAN.

36
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:03,124
TELL ME WHERE IN HISTORY THIS

37
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:05,693
WILL STACK UP TO.

38
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:10,064
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S RAPIDLY

39
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:13,401
BECOMING THE BIGGEST AND MOST

40
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:16,804
SOBERING POLITICAL SCANDAL IN

41
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:17,672
AMERICAN HISTORY.

42
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:20,007
SOMEBODY POINTED OUT EARLIER,

43
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:23,544
BACK WHEN J. EDGAR HOOVER WAS

44
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:26,347
SPYING ON LYNDON JOHNSON'S

45
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:28,382
BEHEST OF RICHARD NEXT SON, WE

46
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:29,984
THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE.

47
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:31,986
WHEN THEY HAD A BREAK IN AT

48
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:33,621
WATERGATE, WE THOUGHT IT WAS

49
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,823
TERRIBLE, THIS IS A MULTIYEAR

50
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:36,490
EFFORT WITH TWO DIFFERENT

51
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:36,824
FRONTS.

52
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:38,025
PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT.

53
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:40,227
ONE FRONT WAS PROTECTING,

54
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,330
COVERING UP FOR BILL AND HILLARY

55
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:42,663
CLINTON.

56
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:44,332
THE OTHER FRONT, AS TRUMP BECAME

57
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:46,968
MORE AND MORE SERIOUS, THE OTHER

58
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:50,171
FRONT WAS TO STOP TRUMP AT ANY

59
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:50,471
COST.

60
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:52,707
I BELIEVE THAT THE REASON YOU

61
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:58,379
SEE PEOPLE LIKE SALLY YATES GO

62
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,182
BERSERK, GENERAL CLAPPER THEY'RE

63
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:02,183
ALL GUILTY.

64
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:03,584
WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE IN THE

65
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:05,152
OBAMA TEAM THAT GETS THAT

66
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,354
RATTLED, THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH

67
00:02:06,354 --> 00:02:07,722
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET DRAWN

68
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:08,322
INTO THIS.

69
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:09,957
THEIR ROLE WILL COME OUT AND IT

70
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:12,026
WILL INVOLVE I THINK FELONIES

71
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:14,729
AND FRANKLY I SUSPECT IT REACHES

72
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,263
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.

73
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:18,366
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT

74
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,301
PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD HAVE HAD

75
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:22,903
THIS MANY THINGS GOING ON AND

76
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,705
NOT KNOWN IT BECAUSE HIS

77
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:26,707
ADMINISTRATION WAS VERY

78
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:27,608
CONTROLLING, VERY TIGHT AND I

79
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,210
THINK WE'RE GOING TO DISCOVER

80
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,312
ALL OF THE STUFF IN THE END ENDS

81
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:33,347
UP WITH THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE

82
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:35,916
AND HAS THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

83
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,985
SENIOR STAFF'S FINGERPRINTS ALL

84
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:38,386
OVER IT.

85
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,487
>> Sean: THE QUESTION REMAINS

86
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:42,323
WHAT DID HE KNOW, WHAT DID KERRY

87
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:44,125
KNOW AND SUSAN RICE AND WHAT DID

88
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,593
CLAPPER AND BRENNAN KNOW.

89
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:47,528
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT

90
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:47,895
UNMASKING.

91
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:48,729
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

92
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,065
HILLARY GETS A RIGGED

93
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:52,733
INVESTIGATION AND THEN COMES THE

94
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,970
EFFORT TO UNDERMINE A PRESIDENT

95
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,905
OR CANDIDATE AND A

96
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:58,706
PRESIDENT-ELECT AND THE

97
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:00,307
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

98
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:06,147
YOU PUT SPIES AND YOU LIE TO

99
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:07,214
FISA JUDGES?

100
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:08,783
>> I THINK THE NUMBER ONE THING

101
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:11,585
THE AVERAGE EVERYDAY AMERICAN

102
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:13,187
CAN TAKE FROM THIS, THE

103
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:15,589
CORRUPTION WAS SO DEEP AT THE

104
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,990
TOP.

105
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,425
REMEMBER, WE'RE NOT TAKING ABOUT

106
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:20,027
THE EVERY DAY FBI AGENT DOING

107
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:20,494
THEIR JOB.

108
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,829
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AT

109
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,797
THE TOP.

110
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:25,466
THEY WERE SO CORRUPT AND SO

111
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,168
ARROGANT THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY

112
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:28,836
COULD GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.

113
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:30,905
SO THEY JUST PROCEEDED DOWN THE

114
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,706
ROAD, PROTECTING HILLARY,

115
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:35,409
COVERING UPHILLRY, GIVING

116
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,243
IMMUNITY TO PEOPLE BREAKING THE

117
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:39,780
LAW AND GOING AFTER TRUMP AND

118
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,615
GOING AFTER TRUMP SUPPORTERS.

119
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,751
WHEN ALL OF THIS COMES OUT AS

120
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,387
ONE IN A WAY THAT IS EASY TO

121
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:47,988
UNDERSTAND, WHICH MAY TAKE

122
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,490
ANOTHER YEAR OR 1 1/2 YEARS

123
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,292
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH OF IT.

124
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:54,028
EVERY TIME WE TURN AROUND,

125
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:55,429
ANOTHER PIECE UNRAVELS.

126
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:57,765
YOU'VE HAD MORE BIG STORIES IN

127
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:59,467
THE LAST 1 1/2 YEARS THAN I

128
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,302
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

129
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:03,270
AGAIN AND AGAIN, YOU'VE BEEN

130
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,172
RIGHT AND INCH BY INCH EVEN "THE

131
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:07,007
NEW YORK TIMES" IS STARTING TO

132
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:07,475
CONCEDE.

133
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:10,411
BY THE WAY, MARK PENN'S COLUMN

134
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:12,780
TODAY IS A REAL BREAK-THROUGH.

135
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,349
HERE YOU HAVE A GENUINE

136
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:16,750
INQUALIFIED MEMBER OF THE LEFT

137
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,652
SAYING THIS IS A THREAT TO ALL

138
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:20,821
OF US AND WE HAVE GOT TO GET RID

139
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:23,491
OF MUELLER BECAUSE HE THREATENS

140
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:25,226
EVERY AMERICAN'S FREEDOM.

141
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:28,229
>> Sean: MR. SPEAKER, YOU

142
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:29,263
UNDERSTAND THE CONSTITUTION.

143
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:30,865
YOU UNDERSTAND CHECKS AND

144
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:33,267
BALANCES, SEPARATION OF POWERS,

145
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,169
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY,

146
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,237
OVERSIGHT OF CONGRESS.

147
00:04:36,237 --> 00:04:37,872
HOW DARE ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHO

148
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:39,673
ALREADY IS CONFLICTED IN THIS BY

149
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:40,708
RECOMMENDING THE FIRING OF COMEY

150
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,880
AND SIGNING ONE OF THE FISA

151
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,181
WARRANTS, HOW DARE THEY NOT TURN

152
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,749
THIS OVER TO CONGRESS?

153
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:49,850
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE DONE WHAT

154
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,719
SHOULD CONGRESS DO.

155
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,053
YOU'RE A FORMER SPEAKER.

156
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:55,389
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S BEGINNING

157
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:56,957
TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

158
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,425
THE PRESIDENT IS BEGINNING TO

159
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,528
WAY IN TO REINFORCE THE

160
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:01,495
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.

161
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:03,731
I THINK YOU -- GENERAL KELLY

162
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,866
BEING GIVEN THIS ASSIGNMENT IS A

163
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:08,936
VERY TOUGH, VERY SERIOUS MAN.

164
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:11,672
I THINK HE'S GOING TO IMPOSE ON

165
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:13,874
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOING

166
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:16,210
THEIR JOB OF TURNING OVER

167
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,711
LEGITIMATE APPROPRIATE

168
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,180
INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATIVE

169
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,513
BRANCH.

170
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:21,282
EVERYBODY OUGHT TO REMEMBER, YOU

171
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:22,516
MENTIONED THE CONSTITUTION.

172
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:23,851
REMEMBER THAT WHEN THEY WERE

173
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:26,187
DONE WRITING IT, BENJAMIN

174
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:29,089
FRANKLIN WAS ASKED BY A WOMAN,

175
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,090
WHO HAVE WE GOT?

176
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,260
HE SAID WE HAVE A REPUBLIC IF WE

177
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,228
CAN KEEP IT.

178
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:36,130
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT TESTS

179
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,933
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

180
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:39,867
CORRUPTION CAME CLOSE TO

181
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,802
DESTROYING THE LIBERTIES YOU AND

182
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:42,269
I BELIEVE IN.

183
00:05:42,269 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sean: IF HILLARY GOT ELECTED,
