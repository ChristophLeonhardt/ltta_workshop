Okay, yeah mom you sure this wasn't my backpack because again

This is like a toy that I used to have when I was young

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,659
I think you may have just got one of my old backpacks Morgan you didnt used to have a Barbie sorehead thing

11
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,798
You want a Peppa Pig toy you preferred Peppa Pig. Anyway, you know what? This looks absolutely

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,509
Beautiful. I mean she's got the same color hair  as me  for a star even though I do prefer Peppa Pig need this picture

13
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,079

This bart again. It's not bart .Oh, man. Oh, yeah. We got homer simpson. Teddy guys. Nice build

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
How much do you think its  worth ,more than pound 20?

18
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,420
\\\\\\\\\\\\\Pounds guys, we've already made profit on this bag. Okay, this feels interesting. This could be expert huh? Oh,

19
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,120

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,820
Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci  Gucci very cool Gucci

21
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:04,360
Rather hold back. Okay. This is getting a bit weird now and then what looks like okay well

22
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:12,249
Back scrubber back scrubber what kind of young  princess takes a back scrubber on holiday

23
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,789
Okay guys, so by the looks of it that was the first bag a bit

24
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,530
Weird one guys

25
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,839
Well, I I didn't do anything well I guess we got the Homer Simpson teddy we got the Barbie oh, oh

26
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,720
Oh cool, that's a good back scratch  that's very good.I think maybe I'll I'll keep keep this

27
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,040
Obviously as well as all the dope stuff inside the bag we have this fresh new bag mom

28
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,049
The question is which bag is fresher the MGZED bag or the princess

29
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,140
Morgan its the princess

30
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:08,439
Well what can I say the bag is pretty dope for the next bit of lost luggage we've got this brown bag right here

31
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,350
What do you think could be in this up to me? Looks like a man-bag to be honest

32
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,570
You guys know I'm a little bit of a fashion icon and I would not be seen dead with this bag. It's ugly

33
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,299
It looks like something my grandpa would wear Morgan

34
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,910
I don't think grandpa would even wear that anyway, who knows maybe we'll find some dope stuff inside

35
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,160
Hear we go Oh

36
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,580
Would you look at that forget what I said about this guy not being fashionable he got one of the gold signature tees what a

37
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,740
Coincidence I think the guy probably got it on sale because if you don't know already

38
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,729

00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:02,318
