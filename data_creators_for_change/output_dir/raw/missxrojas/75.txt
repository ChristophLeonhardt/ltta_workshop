3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about taking the</font>

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,799
time to listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the tracks and</font>

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,900
order that is such a precious moment I

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">listened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the whole thing through once</font>

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">just paying attention to the songs and</font>

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,610

awesome organizing and all sorts of

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,970
other things too and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so</font>

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,369
motivational just having that creative

13
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,699
energy I don't want to use a word energy

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,050
there I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say it's like a</font>

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,609
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dementor but you know what it's</font>

16
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,230
like it's a Patronus it makes me feel

17
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,450
protected it makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel full of</font>

18
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">creative gusto it makes you feel excited</font>

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,820
like in part of some kind of group

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,950
moment and that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling that I</font>

21
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,600
want from the internet if you've seen my

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,890
blood brothers video today it's about

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,480
logging off and about the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took</font>

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,980
off but also about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as</font>

25
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,750
infrastructure and possibility and

26
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,270
something open not something static not

27
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,699
some finite thing that we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,500
get to someone in comments said to me

29
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know obviously there's got a</font>

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,960
little bit under my skin otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

31
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,430
won't be remembering enough to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

32
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,809
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone said to me you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what you</font>

33
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,250
want you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want an expansion of your</font>

34
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,438
echo chamber I want everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apart</font>

35
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,150
the internet i went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see things break</font>

36
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,920
and exploit and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,290
everything but firstly that's not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

38
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,119
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see this echo chamber and it</font>

39
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,369
scares<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I think that it's terrible for</font>

40
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,930
us to be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own echo chambers in the</font>

41
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,590
one hand there is the safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> side of it</font>

42
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,240
that sense of going back into something

43
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that you may go out into the world</font>

44
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,350
and that sets of genuine protection but

45
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,600
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it does lend</font>

46
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,799
to a lack of listening and a failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

47
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079
imagine other people as anything more

48
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,549
than less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you or somehow deficient</font>

49
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,220
in some way and I also think that it

50
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">really shapes the way we talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

51
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,759
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd like playing around a</font>

52
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,500
lot of the idea of tiny internet and

53
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,210
what a tiny internet would constitute

54
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,680
and whether why I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back</font>

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,689
personally to some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tiny internet</font>

56
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,700
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind just to get my head around</font>

57
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,770
play around with pieces and under

58
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,539
and what fits and where one thing I do

59
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,490
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this love miss is a</font>

60
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,829
state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in boxes because i have so</font>

61
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">many in boxes and i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,670
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the purpose and what I'm going there</font>

63
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,979
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what other people are using them</font>

64
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,179
for that sounds really boring but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

65
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,860
think it's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be exciting I'm excited</font>

66
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">for it there are great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lease the</font>

67
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,400
internet and Twitter a place that I

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,750
honed in on at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my video</font>

69
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,099
because i think that twitter has been

70
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the central a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these discussions</font>

71
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,340
about echo chambers and rightly so

72
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,400
because it's like a Shakespearean

73
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,799
heroine or hero its biggest and best

74
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,140
tree is also its downfall it's the

75
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,239
vaulting ambition of Macbeth it's the

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,790
procrastination of Hamlet these things

77
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are so good about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter the fact</font>

78
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,440
that you can actively curate voices and

79
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,870
have the option of listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font>

80
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,239
that you've never heard foreign voices

81
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,700
and thoughts and ideas and histories and

82
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">stories and presents and futures</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

83
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,209
you've never heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before or that</font>

84
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,069
you want to him or that you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

85
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,160
lack of in other forms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

86
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,569
you're interacting with whether that's

87
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,400
muse or people your interaction with

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,260
your day to day life countries are

89
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,790
interacting and interacting with

90
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,319
interacting is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard word to say</font>

91
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,489
a lot when you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a lot of</font>

92
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,049
thoughts at once interacting with in

93
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,790
your day-to-day life the possibility

94
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,109
thereof including those voices in the

95
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:09,150
conversation is massive however on the

96
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,090
other hand it does allow us to create

97
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,069
these spaces where we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing</font>

98
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,590
from other voices and we also kind of

99
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,079
see things as a self-fulfilling prophecy

100
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of strange</font>

101
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,859
confirmation bias<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and then</font>

102
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:25,319
everyone kind of not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily as</font>

103
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,239
harshness this but sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pat's each</font>

104
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,780
other on the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and doesn't</font>

105
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,930
develop that listening skill as much

106
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,840
maybe or develops it in a very

107
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,180
particular environment in a very

108
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,790
particular context but not necessarily

109
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,400
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadly as we need to address some of</font>

110
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,850
the problems that we're coming across

111
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,790
and to really make progress on some of

112
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,540
the stickier issues as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it were whether</font>

113
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,600
that's something as politically specific

114
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,640
as immigration or something less

115
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,770
politically specific and border rural

116
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,410
versus urban areas and that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

117
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,750
divide there or English speaking and

118
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,820
non-english speaking countries and how

119
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,320
they interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one another and talk</font>

120
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,300
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about one another talk to one</font>

121
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,040
another make things accessible and

122
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,779
inaccessible to one another there are so

123
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,029
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that it can and cannot</font>

124
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,310
address and often they're tired along

125
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same lines I think partly because</font>

126
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,150
not necessarily even how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose</font>

127
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,370
design but how we have used it I don't

128
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,500
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when they made Twitter they</font>

129
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,470
went wit<font color="#CCCCCC"> er</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was created on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7th day I</font>

130
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think that could have been any</font>

131
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,500
idea about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would necessarily</font>

132
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,920
use it in 2016 it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be our</font>

133
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,900
response to platforms like that and the

134
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">platform's response as well but I think</font>

135
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">more so our response to it and where we</font>

136
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,500
choose to pitch our tent next that's

137
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,030
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the way where we understand</font>

138
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,120
more about ourselves and it also

139
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,350
communicates more about what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

140
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,200
from our online experience but really

141
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,420
it's kind of false wait to separate that

142
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,730
from my day-to-day experience that's the

143
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,740
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Twitter in particular I</font>

144
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,680
worry a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and journalism</font>

145
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,840
because I was having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conversation with</font>

146
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,060
John I think recently we were talking

147
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,790
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether Twitter was better than</font>

148
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,580
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has replaced you know like</font>

149
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,860
Twitter as your home base for news which

150
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,690
I know it is for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people twitter</font>

151
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,110
is the place where you expect to hear

152
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">up-to-the-minute factual accounts of</font>

153
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,620
what's happening right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now at least from</font>

154
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,150
some sources depending on who you're

155
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,700
following is that kind of headline

156
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,880
journalism and articles being skewed

157
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,700
towards the headline and skewed towards

158
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,490
the preview image is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that better than</font>

159
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it's replaced because maybe it's</font>

160
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,930
given access to more people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the news</font>

161
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,060
so that it's not being communicated in

162
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,830
the same way as Bibles were written in

163
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,720
Latin so people who went to church and

164
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,550
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Bible didn't really</font>

165
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,300
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they were talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

166
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,540
because they weren't given access

167
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,820
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> latin unless it were wealthy i don't</font>

168
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,380
know is that this I'm kind of like

169
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,940
getting stuck in on myself a little bit

170
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,550
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've lost the rigor in</font>

171
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,650
journalism and I think that part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

172
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we feasted upon this</font>

173
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,990
minute by minute feeling and this on the

174
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,590
ground use dad then their headline

175
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,410
itself the 140 characters itself became

176
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,480
the news and i think that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> its credit</font>

177
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter as a platform has responded to</font>

178
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,440
that by trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things like moments</font>

179
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,790
and include lots of different

180
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,740
perspectives that and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

181
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,570
certain general is so pushing back on

182
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and finding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways around that and</font>

183
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,110
challenging that and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a lot</font>

184
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,220
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those other voices in there as well</font>

185
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">but challenge those headlines that are</font>

186
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,570
just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> clickbait and that we see</font>

187
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> replicated in print media because</font>

188
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,320
they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

189
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,390
sharing tomorrow's papers over<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter</font>

190
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,740
so there was a wall street<font color="#E5E5E5"> journal</font>

191
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,180
covered recently for example that

192
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,590
twitter or at least the people i follow

193
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,560
on twitter said wait a minute it takes

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,350
three paragraphs if used to get what to

195
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,210
the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this article which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

196
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,770
this person is lying about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're</font>

197
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,140
saying and it's the front page story so

198
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,700
those kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of examinations are</font>

199
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,890
interesting but at the same time I still

200
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,440
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> convinced that it is better than</font>

201
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,510
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has replaced and that is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

202
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,190
say that which necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> go backwards</font>

203
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,160
and delete or and that was sufficient

204
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,930
because it wasn't and a huge part of

205
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was all on us we weren't paying</font>

206
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,410
enough attention to the stories inside

207
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,730
the newspaper from around the world

208
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,200
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> things were pushing our buttons</font>

209
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,390
much more than others it's not that

210
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">different from what it has replaced in</font>

211
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,780
some ways but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's this feeling of</font>

212
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,670
getting the full story and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

213
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,920
getting the full story being an expert

214
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,680
on it that I feel as a little bit new

215
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,460
and I feel is a sort of change in

216
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,050
attitude and yeah I didn't know

217
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">something about that hyper intellectual</font>

218
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,410
expert culture confuses me because

219
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,550
intellectualism to me had always been

220
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,580
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspire to and to celebrate</font>

221
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,970
and you know was classified as<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

222
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,310
the

223
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,800
things that made people outsiders and I

224
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,690
was like well why is knowing more things

225
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,850
and outside but there's so much allowing

226
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,650
to me is choosing to open the door and

227
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,000
see all of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't</font>

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,710
know and maybe that's what I don't see

229
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,510
reflected I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of also spoke by that</font>

230
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,030
my vlog brothers video that despite as

231
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,420
hyper intellectualism the most

232
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,190
intellectual thing to me almost has

233
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,040
always been saying I don't know here's a

234
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,110
way we could think about it what do you

235
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">think and there's less of that there's</font>

236
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,750
more well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what you meant by what</font>

237
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,660
you said or<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is what you</font>

238
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,750
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't think I'm taking that</font>

239
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,550
person me I've got a pretty thick skin I

240
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,240
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about me being offended</font>

241
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,230
or not I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way we</font>

242
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">have chosen to communicate knowledge</font>

243
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,240
online and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it wasn't an</font>

244
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,130
active choice but maybe it's slightly

245
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,730
born of the way we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools on</font>

246
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

247
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,580
