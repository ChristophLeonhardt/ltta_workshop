thanks to at home for joining us this hour she said later looking back at it that the hardest thing for her was having her parents there she said she needed them there to support her they did provide her great support it gave her strength she loved that they were there to support her but the single most difficult part of the whole ordeal was that they were there that specifically she couldn't protect her mom she couldn't protect her elderly mom and her elderly dad from what happened there in the room the most difficult part my parents were in my mother turned 80 the day of the vote to confirm Clarence Thomas and I believe the difficult part was to watch my parents who were elderly people that live good lives and raise their children and to be honest and truthful and hard-working and all of the things that we want parents to do for their children to watch them go through it the sense that they it that they felt that they couldn't protect me and I think it was really hard on them it undermine their confidence in whether or not the government truly represented them and for an african-american family those kinds of questions have existed to have it personalized I think was really difficult but I have to say they were so strong and so wonderful and so supportive and they never wavered and so but it was still hard for me to watch them go through that and know that I couldn't protect them from the feelings that they had I was so hard on me to know that I couldn't protect them it's hard for them to see that they couldn't protect me it was hard for me to see that I couldn't protect them that portion of that interview with Anita Hill that you just saw there that has actually never been aired before I had seen it in a transcript from that interview they did for the headliner show for which she was interviewed because I had seen that in the transcript I asked for it to be restored so I could show it tonight specifically because this moment for me had always been such a kind of heart in your throat moment from that hearing that hearing where Anita Hill came forward reluctantly she did not want to testify it was after the confirmation hearings for judge Clarence Thomas were already over after the close of those hearings professor Hills allegations came to light and they basically reopened the proceedings to hear from her and it has always stuck with me this this part that happened right at the very start we will make room for your family to be able to sit it's a very large family - well we will we will begin but attempt to accommodate as quietly as we can what may be an unusual arrangement I might ask is everyone who is sitting behind you necessary and to sit behind you and maybe they could stand and let your family sit we must get this hearing moving would there two chairs on the end here we will find everyone a seat but we must begin now professor Hill at the risk of though everyone behind you standing up would you be kind enough to introduce your primary family members to us I'd like to introduce first of all my father Albert Hill mr. Hill welcome my mother miss Hill my mother is going to be celebrating her 80th birthday on the 16th happy birthday in advance that chairman there is very recognizable a much younger Joe Biden then senator chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that's of course before he went on to multiple runs for president and ultimately the vice presidency for eight years under President Barack Obama and as you can see he's being very kind there to Professor Hills family she had just explained in her opening statement that she had grown up on a farm in rural Oklahoma she was the youngest of 13 children she and her siblings were raised by those parents she said in a deeply religious atmosphere and the Baptist Church she'd explained that that was still a very important part of her life and then her parents are shown in after she explains it and and then the hearing gets underway there are parents sitting there behind them her mother on the eve of her 80th birthday and then with them sitting there behind her to support her this is how it goes and actually this is almost the best of how it goes I should tell you if you have kiddos watching with you tonight at home and you do not want them to hear how this went this might be a good time to hit hit pause or hit the mute button can you tell me what incidence has occurred of the ones you've described to us occurred in his office well I recall specifically that the incident about the coke can occurred in his office at the EEOC and what was that incident again the incident with regard to the coke can it's about that state once again for me please the incident involved his going to his desk getting up from a work table going to his desk looking at this can and saying who put pubic hair on my coke was anyone else in his office at the time no was the door closed I don't recall are there any other incidences that occurred in his office with just in his office period there is I recall at least one instance in his office at the EEOC where he discussed some pornographic material or he brought up the substance or the content of pornographic material again it's difficult but for the record what substance did he bring up in this instance in his at EEOC in his office what was the content of what he said this was a reference to an individual who had a very large penis and he used the name that he had been referred to in the pornographic material do you recall it was yes I do the name that was referred to was long dong silver let's go back to the first time you allege judge judge Thomas indicated he had more than a professional interest in you do you recall what the first time was and what he was as much precision as you can what he said to you I recall it either happened at lunch or it happened in his office when he said to me very casually you ought to go out with me sometime you ought to or you are to you ought to with regard to the other incidences that you have mentioned in your opening state can you tell us how you felt at the time were you were uncomfortable you're embarrassed did it not concern you how did you feel about it the pressure to go out with him I felt embarrassed about because I didn't I had given him an explanation that I thought it was not good for me as an employee to working directly for him to go out I thought he didn't take seriously my decision to say no and that he didn't not respect my having said no to him I the the conversations about sex I was much more embarrassed and humiliated by the two combined really made me feel sort of helpless in a job situation because I really wanted to do the work that I was doing I enjoyed that work but I felt that that was being put in jeopardy by the other thinks that were going on in the office and so I was really really very troubled by it and distressed over can you tell the committee what was the most embarrassing of all the incidences that you have alleged I think the one that was the most embarrassing was his discussion of pornography involving these women with large breasts and and engaged in variety of sex with different people or animals that was a thing that embarrass me the most and made me feel the most humiliated if you can in his words not yours in his words can you tell us what on that occasion he said to you you have described the essence of the conversation in order for us to determine well can you tell us in his words what he said I really cannot quote him verbatim I can remember something like you really ought to see these films that I've seen or this material that I've seen this woman has this kind of breast that or that meant a breast that measure this size and they got her in there with all kinds of things she's doing all kinds of different sex acts and you know that kind of though those were the kinds of words where he he he expressed his enjoyment of it and seemed to try to encourage me to enjoy that kind of material professor at your press conference one of your press conferences you said that the issues that you raised about Judge Thomas she referred to as an ugly issue is that how you viewed these conversations yes they were very ugly they were very dirty maybe they were disgusting where any one of these conversations this is my last question my time is up for any one of these conversations other than being asked to go out there any one of them repeated more than once not the same the same conversation reference to their reference to his own physical attributes was repeated more than once yes again for the record did he just say I have great physical capability and attributes or was he more graphic he was much more graphic can you tell us what he said well I can tell you that he compared his penis size he measured his penis in terms of leg length those kinds of comments thank you Mike my time is up under our agreement but this was 1991 professor Anita Hill had not sought this out she had not sought to testify but she told what she said was the truth about her experience with her former employer Clarence Thomas when he was being vetted for the US Supreme Court they had finished his confirmation hearings but she had this tale to tell her story came out she ended up testifying and years later 25 years later she said the single hardest thing about that testimony was not being able to protect her elderly parents in that room from hearing what they had here after chairman Biden went first their Republican senator Arlen Specter went right after Joe Biden and he had some very specific follow-ups he needed to ask professor hill stuff he urgently needed to clear up you testified this morning in response to Senator Biden that the most embarrassing question involved this is not too bad women's large breasts that's the word we use all the time that was the most embarrassing aspect of what Judge Thomas had said to you know the most embarrassing aspect was his description of the acts of these individuals these women that the acts that those particular people would engage in it wasn't just the breast it was the continuation of his story about what happened in those films with the people of with this characteristic physical characteristic with the physical characteristic of the large breath well in your statement to the FBI you did refer to the films but there's no reference to the physical characteristic you described but I don't want to attach too much weight to it but I had thought you said that the aspect of the large breasts was the aspect that concerned you and that was missing from the statement to the FBI I then I have been misunderstood it wasn't the physical characteristic of having large breasts it was the description of the acts that this person with this characteristic would do the acts that they would engage in group acts excellent animals things of that nature involving women professor Hill I'd like you now to turn to page three of your statement that you submitted to the committee we got just this morning and the last sentence on the first full paragraph you again make on that statement a very serious allegation as to Judge Thomas and I would ask you why you didn't tell the FBI about that when they interviewed you I suppose my response would be the same I did not tell the FBI all of the information the FBI agent made clear that if I were embarrassed about talking about something that I could decline to discuss things that were too embarrassing oh you thought you thought that was too embarrassing well how do you feel now professor Hill how's this going for you now how do you feel about having come forward now tell me more details about that so that was 1991 she's a long time ago right 27 years ago senator Biden of course moved on from the Senate became vice president senator Specter has since died senator Orrin Hatch was on that committee he literally at one point waved around a copy of the book The Exorcist at the hearing and accused a Nita Hill of making up some of her claims about Judge Thomas by adapting them from scenes in The Exorcist Senator Chuck Grassley was on that committee back then 27 years ago he's now chair of that committee today it was an all-male roster on the Judiciary Committee today it is still now an all-male roster on the Judiciary Committee on the Republican side but now we're about to get a a second chance as a country some of those settlers from back then are going to have a second chance themselves to figure out how we as a country should hear out allegations of sexual misconduct by a nominee to the United States Supreme Court except this time it's not lurid and extensive allegations of sexual harassment on the job this time the accuser of the Supreme Court nominee is alleging attempted rape reporter Ryan grim at the intercept was first to report that a serious allegation had been made about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that was late Wednesday by Friday morning Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer at The New Yorker were reporting on the rough nature of the allegation which they dated back to Cavanaugh's time in high school at an elite private academy called Georgetown Prep by yesterday professor Christine Blasi Ford had forward saying that although she had tried to protect her anonymity through this process numerous reporters had apparently learned of her identity and so she decided that she would come forward on her own terms and she spoke with Washington Post reporter Emma brown we're going to speak with reporter Emma brown in just a couple of minutes fester block Professor Blasi has has not spoken to anybody other than the Washington Post at this point though someone leaked the contents of the letter she initially wrote to senator Feinstein detailing her allegation that letter has now been published by CNN and the details in that allegation track with what the Washington Post was able to report based on their interview about the content of professor's blah seized allegations against Brett Kavanaugh now the nominee is denying the allegation vehemently he's denying specifically having been present at the party at which Professor Blasi says Brett Kavanaugh drunkenly tried to rape her Republicans on the committee initially tried to handle this development today by just scheduling a call with judge Kavanagh so staffers working for senators on the Judiciary Committee could ask him questions about the allegations they thought that's how they'd handle it Democrats immediately said that was ridiculous they were not going to join in something like that so Republicans could say the allegations had been looked into then Republicans started telling reporters that if there was going to be any looking into these allegations surely it would happen quote in a closed session but then after 6:00 p.m. Eastern tonight Republican senators met in the office of the top Republican in the Senate Mitch McConnell and they emerged from that meeting to announce their decision which was that in fact they will be reopening the Brett Kavanaugh hearings specifically to hear this allegation against the nominee professor Christine Blasi Ford said through her attorney that she will testify under oath judge Kavanagh has also offered to do the same and so number one we now have another week in which more reporting will be done on this story and during which Christine Blasi Ford will presumably continue to bear the slings and air that are now being flung at her from the right for having come forward with this accusation number two this means that the vote that was due to take place on Thursday of this week on Cavanaugh's nomination that will now not take place on Thursday of this week but number three there's now a live issue concerning the FBI senator Feinstein you will remember referred this attempted rape allegation to the FBI we learned of that late last week the FBI did not investigate this allegation they just added the letter laying out the allegation to the background file they had prepared for the White House on the occasion of Cavanaugh's background check now Bloomberg News reported this afternoon that in order for the FBI to further investigate this allegation as part of Cavanaugh's background check they would need the White House to request that the FBI do that the White House has not requested that the FBI should do that and so now tonight's and it Democrats have made a formal request to the White House Counsel done magan formally requesting that the White House through him should make that request should ask the FBI to do due diligence on this allegation against Brett Kavanaugh and that Senate Democrats want that done now they want that done before they hold this open hearing on this allegation next week this is actually just from tonight we just got this audio in from MSNBC congressional reporters Leon Caldwell in Frankfort did you ever get a chance to meet with you I have not yet we have requested several times many times I wanted to wait until after the hearings same they're not the hearings ain't done yet well as of today there weren't some Democrats are concerned because they would prefer the FBI to investigate but before there are hearing this is that what there needs to be some you know look I'm an old prosecutor okay I mean the way this should go is there should be some level of investigation to prepare the committee in my opinion whether that's the FBI or whoever it is to to update background checks and to do some level of investigation that just makes sense to me I think there does need to be first there's only one pad for and it's absolutely crystal clear a complete FBI investigation if there's a hearing before that investigation the committee's going to be shooting in the dark with questions in fact we are blinded working in the dark the FBI has to interview those witnesses under oath all of them and you know it as a former prosecutor and state attorney general there's no way I would put a crime survivor on the stand in front of a jury let alone the American people without a full investigation so that I know what the facts are before I start asking question and that's why going ahead on Monday without an FBI investigation is just a sham and a charade Democrats want the FBI to investigate this allegation that has been referred to them they need the White House to ask the FBI to do that senator Blumenthal saying going ahead on Monday in this open hearing without an SP FBI investigation is a sham and a charade senator Blumenthal be joining us live in just a moment but basically this is a fast evolving story now right this has changed 90 degrees and then another 90 degrees and then another 90 degrees and then it took off on another axis all just since this afternoon so do not check out on this story we are we are living through history here and of course this comes in the midst of an absolutely wild and hugely consequential news environment I mean the storm that started as hurricane Florence will not quit the deaf pole now and the Carolinas is up to 31 Americans as of tonight this devastating flooding continues and continues to spread even though the storm made landfall late last week some rivers in the worst affected areas will not crest until tomorrow night so the flooding is continuing to get worse even now we're gonna have more on that coming up including the latest on a really serious pollution problem and even a nuclear alert in North Carolina just today because of this flooding also we learned today that Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn is finally going to be sentenced he pled guilty the russia investigation and signed an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors in the in sorry-sorry agreement to cooperative prosecutors in the special counsel's office we now know that in the last week of november so after the midterm elections they now plan to finally sentence Mike Flynn for the felony charge to which he pled guilty that means among other things that in court filings between now and then between now and his sentence we're gonna learn how much cooperating my Flynn has actually been doing we will get a description of the extent and the helpfulness of his cooperation from prosecutors in the special counsel's office starting relatively soon now now that they have scheduled his sentencing we also just got this statement from the White House tonight announcing that the president has ordered the declassification of a whole bunch of internal FBI and Justice Department documents from the ongoing Russia investigation he's gonna start making public more text messages among FBI and DOJ officials and specific pages from the applications for search warrants and FBI materials related to Bruce or who was the top Justice Department official working on Russian organized crime and it's connections to the Russian government Bruce or is now the next senior law enforcement or intelligence official who the president seems intent on destroying we have not yet seen any of these documents that the president tonight has ordered Declassified but they'll reportedly start pumping them out over the next few days I will have more on that coming up as well including a very stark warning from one well-informed Democrat who is very alarmed about this turn of events so there's been a world of news breaking over the course of today and particularly into tonight but if you have a sense right now as an American that you are living through history it's because you are you are living through nearly unprecedented scandal and drama surrounding a very troubled presidency you are living through the most consequential counterintelligence and criminal investigation of a sitting US president ever right this second tonight you are living through one of the most controversial and unpopular Supreme Court nominations ever in the history of this country this is history but just because it's history doesn't mean it can't sometimes rhyme with some of the most traumatic political and cultural events we have already lived through we've got the reporter who broke the story open on these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh here with us live next we've got senator Blumenthal joining us live in just a few minutes a big night tonight we'll be right back my name is Anita F Hill and I am a
