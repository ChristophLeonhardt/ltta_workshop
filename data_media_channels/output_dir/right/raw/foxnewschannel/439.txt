00:00:00,818 --> 00:00:01,218
SQUATS.

2
00:00:01,218 --> 00:00:03,020
AINSLEY: WITH A DIAMOND

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,420
CUTTER?

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,155
BRIAN: ANOTHER MAN WHO COOKS

5
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:07,124
ALL THE TIME AND LOVES

6
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:08,525
STEVE'S RECIPES

7
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:09,126
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.

8
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:11,028
HE HAS A BOOK COMING OUT.

9
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:11,728
IT'S UPCOMING.

10
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:14,298
WHY WE FIGHT.

11
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:14,999
DEFEATING AMERICA'S ENEMIES

12
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:16,065
WITH NO APOLOGIES.

13
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:16,800
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

14
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,235
STATES HAD A BIG

15
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,470
ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY.

16
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,471
HE REDID NAFTA.

17
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:21,872
HE HAD ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

18
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,340
PUT IT TOGETHER BEHIND HIM.

19
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,242
BUT AT WHICH TIME HE MADE IT

20
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:26,811
CLEAR WHEN HE OPENED UP FOR

21
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,380
QUESTIONS, KAVANAUGH WAS ON

22
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,980
EVERYBODY'S MIND.

23
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,681
AINSLEY: YESTERDAY HE WAS AT

24
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:31,549
THE RALLY AND HE TALKED

25
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:33,150
ABOUT THE MEDIA AND THE

26
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,450
LEFT.

27
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,585
LISTEN TO THIS AND WE WILL

28
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,220
GET YOUR REACTION.

29
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,788
>> THIS WEEKEND,

30
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,856
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAID THAT

31
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:39,890
IT'S INCORRECT TO SAY YOU

32
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,759
ARE LIMITING THE SCOPE OF

33
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,727
THE FBI INVESTIGATION.

34
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:44,495
>> WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO

35
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:45,296
WITH TRADE?

36
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:46,697
LET'S DO THAT LATER BUT I

37
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,165
WILL CALL YOU A SECOND TIME.

38
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:49,300
YOU ARE GOING BACK TO HIGH

39
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,035
SCHOOL BECAUSE HE HAD BEER?

40
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,503
NOW FOR YOU DEMOCRATS, AND I

41
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:53,804
GUESS I'M INCLUDING YOU TOO,

42
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:54,839
THE MEDIA, RIGHT?

43
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,907
I CONSIDER YOU A PART OF THE

44
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:57,441
DEMOCRAT PARTY.

45
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,176
I THINK THE PRESS HAS

46
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,945
TREATED ME UNBELIEVABLY

47
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:01,279
UNFAIR.

48
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:03,014
THEY ARE LOCO BUT THAT'S

49
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:03,314
OKAY.

50
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,516
I PUT UP WITH IT.

51
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:06,651
AINSLEY: HE TALKED ABOUT IT

52
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,952
AT THE ROSE GARDEN TOO.

53
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:08,719
DR. GORKA, WHAT IS YOUR

54
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,554
REACTION TO THAT?

55
00:01:09,554 --> 00:01:10,354
>> SPOT ON.

56
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:11,589
HE IS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON.

57
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:14,025
THEY HAVE LOST THEIR MINDS.

58
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:14,859
LET'S START WITH THE

59
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,993
KAVANAUGH HEARING.

60
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,728

WE HAVE PEOPLE LIKE DIANNE

64
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:23,935
FEINSTEIN WHO HAD A CHINESE

65
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:26,337
SPY ON HER PAYROLL FOR 20

66
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:26,637
YEARS.

67
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:29,941
WE HAVE PEOPLE LIKE RICHARD

68
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,675
BLUMENTHAL WHO LIED ABOUT

69
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,910
BEING A COMBAT VETERAN IN

70
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,244
VIETNAM.

71
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:34,412
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING

72
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:36,814

00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:38,616
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WHO HAS A

74
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:39,650
SPOTLESS REPUTATION?

75
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,918
LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE

76
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:42,720
IN JUST THE LAST 10 DAYS.

77
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,988
THEY ARE SO DESPERATE TO

78
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,857
STOP THIS GOOD MAN, THIS

79
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,725
GODLY MAN, THEY HAVE TRIED

80
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,193
TO ACCUSE HIM OF BEING A

81
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,428
SERIAL RAPIST.

82
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:52,563
THEY TRIED TO ACCUSE HIM OF

83
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:54,365
TRYING TO KILL THIS WOMAN,

84
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:54,732

AND NOW WHAT'S THE LATEST

86
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:57,502

ANYTHING STICK?

88
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,772
THIS IS LIKE AN SNL SKIT.

89
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:03,575
HE THREW ICE OVER SOMEBODY

90
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:06,644
30 YEARS AGO IN COLLEGE.

91
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,913
THEY ARE LOCO.

92
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:10,481
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

93
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,149
STEVE: THERE WAS SOME SORT

94
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:14,686

95
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,221
HE WAS NOT CHARGED.

96
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:17,455
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE RIGHT.

97
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:18,757

SEBASTIAN, YOU KNOW WHY THE

100
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:21,993
DEMOCRATS ARE DOING.

101
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:23,161
THIS THEY WOULD LIKING TO

102
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:25,263
RUN OUT THE CLOCK,

103
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:25,664
ESSENTIALLY.

104
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,531
HAVE THE REPUBLICANS LOSE

105
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:27,366
CONTROL OF THE SENATE, IT

106
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:30,302
WOULD BE A TIE AND THAT WAY,

107
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:31,870
YOU KNOW, THEIR AGENDA WOULD

108
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,438
NOT BE CHANGED.

109
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:34,873
>> YEAH.

110
00:02:34,873 --> 00:02:36,541
THEY HAVE LOST THE WILL OF

111
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,243
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

112
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,078
DONALD TRUMP BECAME THE

113
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:40,445
PRESIDENT.

114
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:41,546
THEY THOUGHT HILLARY WAS A

115
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:42,748
SHOE IN.

116
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:44,416
REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF THE

117
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,684

00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:48,320
TIMES" 94% CHANCE OF

119
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,653
WINNING.

120
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:49,888
HUFFINGTON POST SAID 97%

121
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:51,390
CHANCE OF WINNING.

122
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,190
IT WAS LOCK INTERESTED IN

123
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,691
FOR HILLARY.

124
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:53,992
THEY LOST, THE AMERICAN

125
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:55,560
PEOPLE DECIDED THAT DONALD

126
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,728
TRUMP WOULD BE PRESIDENT, SO

127
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,363
WHAT'S THEIR ONLY HOPE NOW?

128
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:01,633
TO WIN THE HIGHEST COURT IN

129
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,435

00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:05,470
CONTROL THROUGH THE SUPREME

132
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:05,771
COURT.

133
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,272
AND THAT'S WHY BRETT

134
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:08,473
KAVANAUGH HAS TO BE TAKEN

135
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:10,475
OUT AND WE CAN'T LET IT

136
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:11,009
HAPPEN.

137
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:11,610
BRIAN: IT'S LIKE THIS.

138
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,211
I MEAN, YOU BASICALLY CAN

139
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,212
BLAME THE FIELD.

140
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:23,388
YOU CAN BLAME THE REFS.

141
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:24,890
THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING I

142
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,325
WILL EXPAND THE FBI

143
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:28,026
INVESTIGATION BUT EVERYTHING

144
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:29,494
IS GOING TO END ON FRIDAY.

145
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:30,929
ONE THING TELLING HE SAID

146
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:32,731
LISTEN, I'M USED TO THE

147
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:33,131
ATTACKS.

00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,433
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH

149
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,000
THIS JOB.

150
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,734
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS NOT.

151
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,235
I WORRY ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

152
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:38,503
MAYBE LIKE YOU COULD REALLY

153
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:39,838
IDENTIFY WITH IT.

154
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:40,605
WAITING FOR THE NOMINATION

155
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:41,606
PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE.

156
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:42,841
AND IT NEVER HAPPENED.

157
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,443
THEY QUIT THEIR JOBS.

158
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:45,911
THEY LINE UP THEIR

159
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:46,378
BACKGROUND.

160
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:47,546
THEY GIVE INTO ALL OF THIS

161
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:49,281
THEY JUST WAIT, WAIT, AND

162
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:49,581
WAIT.

163
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:50,382
AND OUR GOVERNMENT IS

164
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:53,051
WORKING WITH AN ARM BEHIND

165
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,618
ITS BACK.

166
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:55,120
IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP

167
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,754
REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS OR

168
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:56,221
THE COUNTRY.

169
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,389
WHO WATCHES BRETT KAVANAUGH

170
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,757
AND THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR

171
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:00,025
THEM AND THEIR FAMILY TO GO

172
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,493
FORWARD WITH SERVING THE

173
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:01,893
GOVERNMENT.

174
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,261
BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET RICH

175
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:03,962
DOING IT.

176
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,063
>> RIGHT.

177
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,366
BRIAN, LOOK.

178
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,467
I HAVE BEEN THERE.

179
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:09,735
