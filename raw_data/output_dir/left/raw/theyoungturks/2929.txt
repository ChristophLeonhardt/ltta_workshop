1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,890
>>A MAN PERSONALLY DELIVERED
HORSE SHIT IN A GIFTWRAPPED

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,650
PACKAGE TO STEVEN MNUCHIN'S
HOUSE THIS YEAR AS A CHRISTMAS

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,320
GIFT TO REPAY THE TREASURY
SECRETARY FOR THE NEW TAX LAW.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,631
HE ENCLOSED A NICE LITTLE LETTER
TO HIM SAYING HEY STEVIE, WE ARE

5
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:20,720
RETURNING THE GIFT OF THE
CHRISTMAS TAX BILL, IT'S

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
BULLSHIT.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,620
THIS CAME FROM ROBBY
STRONG, AND HE WROTE, WARMEST

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,240
WISHES, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,880
THIS IS A PICTURE OF ROBBY

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,600
STRONG WHO ADMITTEDLY SENT THE
MANURE --

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:47,289
>>ON FACEBOOK STRONG WROTE --

12
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:57,359
>>HE CONTINUED HIS INTERVIEWS
TO OTHER NEWS OUTLETS, IN ONE HE

13
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,000
SAID HE WAS LIKE JESUS.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,829
I WILL
READ HIS QUOTE --

15
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:17,720
>>HE SAID THAT HE'S NOT WORRIED
ABOUT BEING ARRESTED, HE DOESN'T

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,790
THINK IT'S ILLEGAL TO DELIVER
MANURE TO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE, AND

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,860
ACCORDING TO ONE OFFICIAL, IF
THE GIFT DOESN'T PRESENT ANY

18
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,480
DANGER HE MIGHT NOT GET ARRESTED
FOR IT.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
HE HASN'T BEEN ARRESTED

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,560
THUS FAR, AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
MIGHT NOT FACE ANY CHARGES FOR

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,100
THIS ACT, HE'S JUST GETTING
DEATH THREATS ONLINE BUT THAT'S

22
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,010
HOW THE INTERNET WORKS.

23
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,210
>>LOOK, HE'S A FUNNY GUY AND I
THINK HE DID THIS IN THE RIGHT

24
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,810
SPIRIT, BUT I'M GOING TO BE A
LITTLE BAH HUMBUG ABOUT IT -- HE

25
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,750
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

26
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,142
BECAUSE
GOING TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES IS A

27
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:52,830
DIFFERENT LAYER.

28
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,340
THEN EVERYBODY
IS SHOWING UP EVERYBODY'S HOUSE

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,500
WAS SHIT, AND AT SOME POINT IT'S
WENT TO HIT THE FAN. AND IN THE

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,630
CASE OF MANURE, SOMETIMES THEY
USE MANURE FOR EXPLOSIVES,

31
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,080
THAT'S WHY THE COPS HAD TO BE
SUPER CAREFUL AND DUMP IT ALL

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,810
OVER THE PLACE, WHICH ACTUALLY
LED TO THE FUNNIEST QUOTE, THE

33
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,350
WINTER WERE OF ZSA ZSA GABOR
SAID WE HAVE $50 MILLION HOMES

34
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,590
AND WE CAN'T MOVE, THEY HAVE TO
FIND ANOTHER WAY.

35
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,590
I WOULDN'T

36
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,560
HAVE PHRASED IT THAT WAY TO THE
PRESS.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,700
I THINK YOU WILL BE OKAY

38
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,300
AND YOUR $50 MILLION HOME FOR A
LITTLE LONGER.

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,340
BUT DON'T GO TO

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,440
PEOPLE'S HOUSE.

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,830
I LIKE THAT IT'S
NO SUBTERFUGE, HE WAS LIKE, THIS

42
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,701
IS ME, I'M NOT A TROLL, I DON'T
HAVE ANY BAD INTENT, I WANT TO

43
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:45,600
POINT OUT THE TAX BILL IS
BULLSHIT -- BUT STILL, I WOULD

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,830
HAVE COUNSELED AGAINST IT.

45
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,709
>>I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM GOING
TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE, BUT I'M KIND

46
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,250
OF GLAD THAT HE DID IT WITH THE
SHIT.

47
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,900
THAT'S A GUY WHO WANTED TO

48
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,510
USE THE GOVERNMENT PLANE FOR A
PERSONAL TRIP, RIGHT?

49
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,510
THE ONE

50
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,440
WHO IS WITH THE ACTRESS, THEY
WANTED -- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,590
WHEN PEOPLE GET FED UP.

52
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,930
THESE
ARE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE

53
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,060
SHITTING ON, AND NOW THE PEOPLE
YOU ARE SHITTING ON ARE TAKING

54
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,260
THE SHIT BACK TO YOUR HOUSE.

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,660
I
DON'T THINK IT'S COOL TO SHOW UP

56
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,260
TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES, ESPECIALLY
PEOPLE WHO HAVE FAMILIES WHO

57
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,670
AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU
ARE DOING, BUT I DEFINITELY

58
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,800
THINK IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT
EVERYBODY IS ACCESSIBLE AT THIS

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,170
POINT, YOUR ADDRESS IS ONLINE,
AND YOU HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE

60
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,880
FOR HOW YOU TREAT PEOPLE BECAUSE
NOT EVERYONE IS 100% AND SOMEONE

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,610
MIGHT SHOW UP AT YOUR HOUSE WITH
A BOX OF SHIT.

62
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,430
>>HE SAID THIS IS HIS FORM OF
PROTEST, WE'VE BEEN SO JADED

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,040
TOWARD PROTESTS AND THIS IS HIS
WAY OF BRINGING ATTENTION TO

64
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,270
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT, THIS
TAX BILL THAT IS SCREWING OVER

65
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,560
AMERICANS, I'M WITH HIM ON THAT,
BUT DON'T GO TO ANYONE' IS

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,000
HOUSE, DON'T DELIVER SHIT TO
ANYONE.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,260
WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO

68
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
HIGH.

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,540
>>I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD
PHRASE IT THAT WAY.

70
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,540
LAST THING

71
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,070
ON THIS, HE SHOWS UP WITH SHIT,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE SHOWING

72
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,470
UP WITH OTHER STUFF.

73
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,440
WASHINGTON
THINKS WE ARE THE RADICAL LEFT,

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,709
YOU WILL FIND THAT WE ARE THE
MODERATES.

75
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,709
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH

76
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,130
PITCHFORKS BEHIND US.

77
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,800
AND SOME
WAS SHIT FORKS.

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,410
AIDA IS RIGHT,

79
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:36,380
THEY ARE PUSHING PEOPLE TOO FAR,
BUT DON'T GO TO SOMEONE' IS

80
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,380
HOUSE.

81
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:44,050
THAT'S 
A RECIPE FOR

82
00:04:44,050 --> 00:00:00,000
DISASTER.
