a Palestinian man who's attempting to have the right to remain in the UK is now getting the backing of British MPs they're pressuring the Home Office to rethink so-called stateless asylum applications the man in question has been without legal status since he was a child and was rejected under British law Mohammed was referred to us because he was destitute and on the streets for several years and he stayed in a family home for the first time in many many years they have told him to go back to Palestine on repeated occasions and he said okay I'm willing to go back he couldn't go back he didn't have the paperwork and then the Home Office accused him of not being Palestinian even if you have left Palestine as a child you should be able to demonstrate knowledge of your heritage and culture having no identity documents does not make you stateless we then find somebody amongst our host who is willing to take Herman it's also important because he is more likely to get the emotional human pastoral support that he needs you
