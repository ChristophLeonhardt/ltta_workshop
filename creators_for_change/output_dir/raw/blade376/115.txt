1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,860
every day I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of so many things I</font>

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,140
want to make a video on and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,050
choose what to do and when to do it you

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you've got to choose the right</font>

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,560
moment that I feel people will be most

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,020
engaged with the topics because it's

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,730
about inspiring it's about educating

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,380
it's about having a discussion about

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,170
things that matter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be honest I</font>

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,970
wasn't going to do a video today but

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,649
this evening I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just about to go to</font>

12
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,739
bed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was watching the Senate in the</font>

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">state's talking about the NDAA about</font>

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,020
indefinite detention I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,900
disgusted by the irrational behavior

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,810
rhetoric many of these are elected

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,600
officials were using and when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,260
passed the legislation or at least to go

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,780
to the president for Obama to have his

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,650
last chance of making a veto on it I

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,060
actually was sick from anxiety and I get

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,920
it from time to time and I say its

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,560
realization of what a mess this world is

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,420
in but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth is I thought I always</font>

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,420
know what a mess<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world is in its why</font>

26
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,300
every second I have free time I don't

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,420
spend it watching TV or and you know

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,310
just chatting rubbish about whatever I

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">just think about what is the best thing</font>

30
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us to do now because the truth is</font>

31
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,500
time is running out and there are going

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,560
to be people who straight away go I'm

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,690
paranoid I'm crazy and so I'm just going

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,900
to give you I'll give you two things to

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,310
really consider and if you don't

36
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,680
understand them fully then research it

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,820
and if you're not sure how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,560
researching stuff I've actually come up

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,330
with my own method recently which I

40
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,430
think you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> find handy but first the</font>

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,680
two things the first thing is an

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,930
infinite growth paradigm this is the

43
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,570
call reasoning I am so concerned about

44
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,159
the course the planet is taking right

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,400
now because we live in a monetary system

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,399
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about making money it's about using</font>

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">money to allocate resources on supply</font>

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,780
and demand but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has no relationship</font>

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,189
with the finite resources on the planet

50
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:19,080
now you can say well it does because

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,680
when supply goes low the price goes up

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,200
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the resources were using but</font>

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,950
it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about knee-jerk reactions</font>

54
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,690
about last<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute things like we will</font>

55
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,910
only change what we're doing when we

56
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,459
have to it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about short-term gains and</font>

57
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,230
so the question I want to ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in</font>

58
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,200
the current way that we live is this

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,870
sustainable because the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no</font>

60
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,010
it's not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I reckon that we have due</font>

61
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,540
to a lot of research I've looked into

62
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,420
you have to about twenty fifty for us to

63
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,340
change our patterns because population

64
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,930
will hit a critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> mass in which is no</font>

65
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer sustainable which can only mean</font>

66
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">mass starvation will territorial</font>

67
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,290
disputes and this comes to the whole

68
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,079
issue of why we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to act now because</font>

69
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,260
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chance we possibly</font>

70
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,569
have of changing things for the better

71
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:13,120
and the further down the line we go the

72
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,709
worse it's going to get and i'll give

73
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a metaphor that i use again and</font>

74
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,950
again which I think really demonstrates

75
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,650
well what I'm talking about and it's

76
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,360
imagined being on a ship let's say the

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,000
Titanic which is about to sink there

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,340
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be people who are in the bar who</font>

79
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,569
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking and thinking it's</font>

80
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,930
unsinkable but as it starts sinking some

81
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,450
people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for life raft and try and</font>

82
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">get away but what I'm saying is well put</font>

83
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:40,299
the ship is sinking we need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

84
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,239
a plan B we need to think of some

85
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,430
solutions because if we leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

86
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,680
the very last minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it's like well</font>

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,079
it's jump off now or we're dead we're

88
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,299
all going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going for the life rafts</font>

89
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there we haven't prepared</font>

90
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,620
ourselves and it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only lead in chaos</font>

91
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,980
in which we are fighting for survival

92
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,920
amongst ourselves the second thing I

93
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,440
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to look up is technological</font>

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,680
singularity it's a really interesting

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology is evolving</font>

96
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,170
at such an exponential rate like

97
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,720
population and therefore it becomes an

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,228
issue by 2050<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whether we're going to</font>

99
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:22,240
prevail or perish are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to learn</font>

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technology to benefit humanity or</font>

101
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:28,510
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be used in ways that</font>

102
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,760
destroys us because if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a lot</font>

103
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,070
of technology it can liberate humanity

104
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,289
but when you look at it in terms of the

105
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,780
monetary<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know efficiency in</font>

106
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,000
technological one

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,850
appointment it's not compatible and

108
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,900
that's why we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

109
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,720
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge changes and battles of</font>

110
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,360
traditional verse emergent structures

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,420
happening in society over the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

112
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,340
years you know when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> young it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

113
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,410
about we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta recycle and look after</font>

114
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,380
the planet now for future generations

115
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,040
sure that is true<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what is also true</font>

116
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,290
is it's about our<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation we are</font>

117
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,910
going to be living through this and the

118
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,740
sooner<font color="#CCCCCC"> we act the better a chance we</font>

119
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,720
have of sorting this out and so when it

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,850
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to research what's my advice well</font>

121
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,370
the way I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now is this it's all</font>

122
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,710
about validating what you research

123
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,440
ensuring that what you have isn't just

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,390
an opinion that you've researched it as

125
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,240
best as you can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore what I do</font>

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,250
is when I watch a YouTube video or look

127
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,530
at a news article anything that

128
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,390
interests me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think has some really</font>

129
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,120
interesting points I sit down and I take

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">bullet point notes but after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each bullet</font>

131
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,010
point I will draw a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and in</font>

132
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box i'll put verified and then after</font>

133
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,750
I've done all my notes on the article or

134
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,720
the video either straight after or I'll

135
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,300
you know have a break go off and come

136
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,430
back to it later I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> then go through</font>

137
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,919
each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those bullet points and research</font>

138
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,530
them and validate them you know find

139
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,720
other evidence around the internet and

140
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,780
using articles to validate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

141
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> process you may disprove it you may</font>

142
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,050
prove it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

143
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,450
even more than what you got from reading

144
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,800
that initial article you'll get a

145
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,340
broader sense of things which for me is

146
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,229
worked so well and I urge<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do it</font>

147
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:17,790
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone can educate themselves</font>

148
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,820
the internet is the best tool for doing

149
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,760
there and finally I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

150
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,300
project I'm doing in 2012 I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

151
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,600
up a UK tool in which if there are any

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,900
radio stations if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any</font>

153
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,650
newspapers whether mainstream or local

154
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,080
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are schools that allow people</font>

155
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,140
to come in for talks universities

156
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,240
anything I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set up a tour in</font>

157
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,789
which I will take one to two weeks off

158
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:48,340
work

159
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will go around the country doing</font>

160

that I'm right but just to you know make

163
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,210
people start asking the right questions

164
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,490
and I think it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing to</font>

165
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,830
engage young people with because people

166
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,740
do care it's just allowing them to feel

167
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a</font>

168
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,930
community of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the world that</font>

going to talk about it's mainly going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

177
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,530
be identifying the biggest problems in

178
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,560
society today and also suggesting some

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,440
solutions which aren't common knowledge

180
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,419
one example is something i learned five

181
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,039
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a technique in which</font>

182
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,960
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can read up to a hundred pages a</font>

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,479
minute with total recal now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

184
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,370
already you'll be going that's that's

185
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">impossible yeah we would have heard</font>

186
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,760
about it already well the question is

187
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,470
people haven't or a lot of people

188
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard about it already so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

189
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:59,710
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be asking yourself why is that</font>

190
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,860
and there are some logical reasons

191
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,160
behind that but I have done it it is an

192
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,320
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool and I think that alone</font>

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,260
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available to the mainstream so</font>

194
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,700
these are sort of things I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

195
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,940
into so am I wanted to get that off my

196
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,229
chest um keep fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the good fight</font>
