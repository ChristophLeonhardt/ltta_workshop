Andrew Gillum’s surprise
win in the primary race
for Florida’s governor
is the latest in a series 
of breakthrough victories
for black Democratic
candidates,
which also includes 
Ben Jealous of Maryland
and Stacey Abrams of Georgia.
Gillum, the mayor
of Tallahassee,
played unapologetically
to the progressive left.
“How about running for
governor and being
the most progressive Democrat,
who would invest a billion dollars
in education, and create
Medicare for all?”
His strategy?
Appeal to voters
who have historically
skipped the midterms,
like young people
and minority voters.
And get them
to the polls.
“In order for a candidate
like me to win,
I’ve got to be
able to turn out
those voters who
are highly skeptical
of the political process.”
Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s 
Democratic nominee for governor,
is making a similar bet.
“My approach is, every
Democratic voter we can get,
especially those who
don’t think their voices matter,
and independent thinkers
who realize they are
heading down the wrong path
if they don’t vote
for a Democrat this time.
And there are enough 
of us to win an election.”
Both Gillum and Abrams
are running against
Trump-style conservatives.
Ron DeSantis in Florida.
“Ron loves playing with the kids.”
“Build the wall!”
And Brian Kemp in Georgia.
“I got a big truck, just
in case I need to round up
criminal illegals and take
them home myself.”
In Maryland, Ben Jealous,
former president of the N.A.A.C.P.,
beat out a crowded
field of candidates
to win the Democratic
nomination for governor.
Jealous faces long
odds to unseat
Larry Hogan, a popular
Republican incumbent,
but believes he has
a shot at turning out
enough left-leaning 
voters to win.
“Larry Hogan’s go-along
to get-along politics,
and his policies on
almost every issue,
stand in direct contrast
to those I laid out 
in this campaign.”
All three candidates
have also benefited
from the endorsement
of Vermont senator
and progressive standard-bearer
Bernie Sanders.
“We are going to elect this man
as the next governor
of this state.”
If they win,
Gillum and Jealous will be
the first black governors
in their states.
And Abrams, the first
black female governor
in the nation.
