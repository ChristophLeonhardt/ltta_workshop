Donald Trump's new admission that he was lying about the Trump Tower meeting was so brazen and so dramatic it could be a Hollywood movie confession scene and that's why in a moment i'm joined by filmmaker and activist Rob Reider who knows his way around a plot first let's look at the context it was just last year when Donald Trump said that his son's meeting with the Russians was only about Russian adoption then this weekend he comes out and says no it was to get information on an opponent foreign information could be a crime in other words Trump is telling everyone he was lying this is the kind of moment you rarely see where a main character if you will a protagonist admits they were lying something we've even seen in Rob Reiner zone films who blames means to bluff so you're probably playing cards and he cheated you can't handle the truth the movie was about 80% accurate and 20% book which I guess by Hollywood standards is an accomplishment the director of the film's you just saw a few good men as well as the new film shock and awe which deals with government lies thanks for being here my pleasure lies yes why do people admit them and keep getting away with them in plots including potentially this American plot well they get away with them in plots until somebody uncovers the lie and that becomes a big focal point of the story when all of a sudden the story flips because a lie is exposed we are having an experience with a guy who lies all the time constantly constantly lies and is lying right to our face and we have not as yet gotten to that point where those lies become the plot twists that flips and nails them there's something that's been was told to me and when we were doing the the case against a Proposition 8 which was to establish marriage equality one of the lawyers says to me you know you can say whatever you want on but the minute you go into a courtroom and you put your hand on the Bible and swear to tell the truth you have to tell the truth that's the reason why this president who is a pathological liar is not going to talk to robert muller he is incapable of telling the truth but at a certain point he's gonna hit the wall where the truth and reality are gonna come and smack him upside the head and he's gonna have big problems big big problems sort of an upside your head moment but and it's gonna be the biggest political plot twist you'll have ever seen in the history of this country because you've got a guy lying by way admitting to crimes all over the place everybody in this administration is committing crimes and admitting to it but at a certain point they're gonna be held accountable the first step is for us to take back the house and start having the right kind of hearings that will get the truth out and then ultimately over time people hopefully will come around to accepting the truth because if we don't then then we don't have democracy anymore I wonder in your view about a character who knows they're lying versus doesn't care and doesn't keep track of it we showed a few good men where what is so unrealistic what rarely happens in the courtroom no offense is a bit of what Donald Trump does on Twitter where someone actually says yeah no you know what everything I said was bull I was lying now I'm saying this which always raises the question why would we believe you now take a look at Donald Trump lying based on what we've been able to figure out about his well known and documented practice of pretending to be another person his spokesperson which is a lie and then he lies about it take a look at this from the tenacious non baron here we go that become where he is Donald Trump now and you can just come somebody showed me the article and I think yet 200 and 200 there was not me on the phone and it doesn't sound like me on the phone I will tell you that and it was not me on the phone okay so first of all it was him on the phone and when I heard this this was during the campaign I learned about this this habit he has going on and talking as this guy John Baron or one of these other characters I thought to myself this guy is certifiably insane because think about this for a second who do you know that gets on a phone and pretends to be somebody else on this kind of level and talks to a journalist to get information out that's insane that's insanity and I thought when I heard that is how can that guy be president Howard how we gonna allow a person who does a thing like that become President of the United States and and you know it happened but that's as crazy that's kind of beyond pathological there's some kind of mental illness that that allows for something like we got that we don't know at a distance what it is we know that he's caught on tape to tape plays and he has the ability to just say that wasn't me or in this weekend's version admit to his supporters I was lying the whole time and I want people to stay with me on that yeah well I think you know he has a certain cult of followers for whatever reason they're gonna follow him but he has no problem lying if it's transactional does it help him to lie to that guy and say about Donald Trump on the phone yes does it help him try to say that wasn't Donald Trump yes whatever's gonna help them at that moment that's what he does and he doesn't care about the you know the ramifications of it and with 15 seconds to go Rick gates testimony today as someone who's been following Russia that's right you as an important day it is I don't think it's as important right this second because it's ultimately about Paul Manta Forte's you know financial dealings but he will also have a lot of information about Manta Ford's connection to Roger and his connection to Trump Rob Reiner thanks you can
