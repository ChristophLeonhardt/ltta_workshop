tonight we are balancing competing news stories and competing interests and for that we are happy to be joined by telephone by John Brennan former director of the CIA and newly minted MSNBC senior national security and intelligence analyst director Brennan I'm very curious to get your take on the personnel moves today that followed the word that Rex Tillerson would be leaving as Secretary of State we'll take them first things first and that is mr. Pompeo leaves your old agency and goes to state and it is said that he made an impression on Donald Trump by being his daily briefer I know it is a role you served in for Bill Clinton in 94 and 95 so your opinion of mr. Pompeo as he goes over to state from CIA Administrator over the last 14 months that he is a very loyal and strong supporter of Donald Trump and someone who has been able to establish good rapport with him which is a real positive when it comes to having a Secretary of State who is aligned with a president so I think Donald Trump saw and Mike Pompeo someone who obviously is very smart he also was very partisan but I think above all mr. Trump values loyalty and I think Mike Pompeo has demonstrated that what's he gonna be like toward the Russians well that's a good question I think when pressed he has had to say that he certainly supports the CIA assessment about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and he has met with his Russian counterparts I hope he's going to take a very firm and hardline with the Russians I think Russian activities continues around the globe we see at least some implications in the UK that at least according to the British reports that the Russians like they were involved in the poisoning of individual and the daughter so I think it's probably important for the Secretary of State if he is confirmed to hold the hardline and also make sure that Donald Trump understands just how dangerous the Russians can be and the need to demonstrate strengthen resolve but toward them of course this move creates a vacancy at your beloved former headquarters in Langley Virginia and for that the president has put forward the name of Jena Haspel a veteran of the CIA but not without controversy herself because of her involvement there are degrees people argue of her involvement in in torture at black sites after 9/11 now I heard a longtime colleague of hers say on television today let's not judge her for actions in Oh - based solely on 2018 standards and by this he meant that we were all some form of crazy back then we were all morning we were all shaken and we had kind of given our proxy to a whole lot of people at the top of our government to do what it was required to keep us safe and a whole lot of Democrats and a whole lot of Republicans had given the president and his administration a lot of leeway so having set that up for our audience your view professionally of Gina Haspel who is the nominee to take over as head of CIA what's the points first of all Gina is a exceptionally well-respected professional within CIA she has held a number of senior level positions over the years and has acquitted herself very competently and I think she has the experience the breadth and depth on intelligence issues and dealing with these meddlesome foreign policy issues for many many years so that she would be able to provide that unvarnished a political objective intelligence input to adopt something to others secondly yes the CIA was involved in a very controversial program the detention segregation program but let's not forget that that was a program that was directed and authorized by President Bush and it was deemed woful by the department justice and CI officers including Gina hospital time carried out those responsibilities to the best of their ability there were some CIA officers that were held to account for excessive expenses during that time but Gena by all my recollection was not involved in anything that was not authorized I'll be a controversial so I do think that her role in that program will be subject to scrutiny by the Senate Intelligence Committee and rightly so but I have confidence that Gina is going to be able to provide them a full and honest accounting of her role in her actions during that time and last question the part of her role that smacks of skullduggery especially if you listen to some of the Democrats who intend to oppose it is her alleged role in the destruction of video evidence of acts of torture do you can you speak to that allegation circulating the press and I can't get into any classify the patient yeah but she served as the chief of staff for individual who had authorized those destruction so she was in the agency at that time again involved in this this program and again I think that she will need to explain to the Senate subcommittee personally and directly what happened at that time both in terms of the program itself her role as well as than the destruction of the videotapes director Brennan were awfully happy to have you of counsel around here and thank you very much for making time to join us by telephone on this busy night we appreciate it thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
