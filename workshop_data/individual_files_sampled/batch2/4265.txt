we've got new and actually somewhat mysterious developments in the Russia probe this morning Special Counsel Robert Muller is looking to give five potential witnesses immunity to testify in Paul manna for its upcoming trial but here's the mystery we don't know who they are because Muller also asked a federal judge to keep those five names under seal unless they're actually called to testify Trump's former campaign chairman is currently in jail after having his bail revoked last month jury selection in the first of his two trials set to start one week from today NBC News investigative reporter Tom winter joins me now so what do we know about this latest development okay so this is what's called a use immunity deal crest and basically what it means is that anything that they say on the witness stand if they're called to testify will not be used against them in any sort of future proceeding or any sort of future criminal case or any case so basically they have immunity the second they step on that witness stand to testify truthfully and accurately in even if it's incriminating against them that that testimony is struck from any future proceedings so it immune and immune it gives them thank you very much it gives them immunity moving forward so that's the advantage for the people that are going to testify but we don't know who they are and we won't know right unless unless they've testified that's exactly correct the other thing that I want to point out is they technically have to testify the things that Manta Ford has been charged with so I know there was a lot of speculation yesterday about what could they say what could they indicate well it really is going to be pretty tightly narrowing scope is to the charges that Manta Ford already faces here so this is really a situation where I think if people are expecting some sort of a bombshell development to come out of this testimony it's possible but really it has to be towards the the things that Manta Ford is actually charged with yeah metaphors lawyers one of this trial move the judge essentially said doesn't matter where you go right your everybody knows what's going on here exactly right so they argued two things one that there's a tremendous amount of pretrial publicity obviously we seem to talk about this case every single day and that it also has there's also a lot of interest in the Washington DC Alexandria area where this trial is going to be held the second thing that they argued is look at the voting record from the last election most people in this area where the jury is going to be picked from voted Democratic so they wanted to move this towards Western Virginia to the Roanoke area in so that they could have a voter base there or a jury base there where the vote is much more 50/50 these things almost never succeed you know you're not constitutionally allowed to have a a split jury out for public and half Democrat or a jury of your peers and the other thing is the judge said look we've got an exaustive juror questionnaire here we're gonna voir dire these jurors we're going to talk to them we're gonna interview them and the judge said look if I find that we can't find unbiased jurors to be put on this jury I'll reconsider it but really these motions almost never succeed all right Tom thank you let me bring in Glenn Kirchner former federal prosecutor what is it signal to you Glenn why would Muller ask for immunity for five potential witnesses whoever they may be well Chris let me say first of all that grants of immunity are pretty common in criminal trials and let's use one of the more usual scenarios let's assume that there is a murder that's committed and it's committed late at night in a dark alley and there's only one witness and that witness was selling crack cocaine at the time he observed the murder what would happen if that witness were called to testify in the homicide trial he would be asked sir what were you doing at the time you observed the the murder and he would have to truthfully testify I was selling crack cocaine so that would incriminate him because the government the prosecutors could turn around use that statement against the witness and bring a charge of distributing illegal narcotics that's why prosecutors will secure grants of immunity for witnesses so they can feel comfortable testifying fully and truthfully even if some of that testimony includes crimes they may have committed that use immunity guarantees that the statements the witness makes at that trial cannot be used against him and not surprising that they would keep their identity secret right because especially if you have someone who went to jail because he was charged with witness tampering you don't necessarily want these folks to be known or even just to be harassed right in a situation where you have such a high profile trial exactly Chris and you know there's another thing because Bob Muller has sought grants of immunity for five witnesses it may be that the prosecution will only need to put two of those witnesses on so the identity of the other three immunized witnesses would never have to be made public and if I can let me just talk about how this might play out in Paul Manafort trial and against the backdrop that I just explained Paul Manafort among other things is charged with bank fraud let's assume that when he was filling out his application for the loan he fraudulently included information that maybe overstated his assets or understated his debts and liabilities and the bank manager basically was aware of it covered it up and granted the loan anyway that bank manager could very well have a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination so Bob Muller's team would secure immunity for that bank manager so he or she could testify a Paul Manafort trial without fear of reprisal let me ask you finally about all these requests and again these requests not unusual to move the trial as Tom said also we know man affords team one of the trial date push back we're still waiting to hear from the judge on that do you think that's at all likely and is there anything out of the ordinary about all these requests there's nothing out of the ordinary first of all with respect to a motion to change venue that is move the location of the trial from Alexandria Virginia to another jurisdiction farther outside the Washington DC area in my nearly 30 years as a prosecutor I have never once seen a judge grant a change of venue motion it just doesn't happen particularly in a case like this where the publicity is not just nationwide it's worldwide and so I don't think that's unusual I also do think that judge Ellis will continue to deny motions to continue the trial and we're gonna see this trial kick off on July 25th hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me
