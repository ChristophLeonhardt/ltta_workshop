Wendie Vitter the wife of former Louisiana Senator David Vitter has been nominated by Donald Trump to become a federal judge a district judge she according to reports is the general counsel or a lawyer to the Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans and is currently being considered for the position of US District Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans now she is undergoing hearings and in those hearings a lot of her views on social issues are coming up including her views on reproductive rights she is very much right-wing very much against reproductive rights and in the next video she is specifically asked about the issue of segregation okay so she's asked about brown v board of education which I think most people would be comfortable answering 9 nothing Supreme Court decision okay here's how she handled that question take a look he's better do you believe that Brown versus Board of Education was correctly decided center I don't mean to be coy but I think I get into a difficult a different difficult area when I start commenting on Supreme Court decisions which are correctly decided and which I may disagree with again my personal political or religious views I would set aside that is Supreme Court precedent do you believe it was correctly decided again no respectfully not comment on what could be my bosses ruling the Supreme Court I would be bound by it and if I start commenting on I agree with this case or don't agree with this case I think we get into a slippery slope she she a judge now she Bennett she's a lawyer for the Catholic Church well yeah here was it it was the easiest question in the history of questions ever asked know it this is insane so by the way she was a follow-up to that and it was a little bit of a softball actually to kind of give her an opportunity to say I do agree with that decision because that is a terrible way of answering that question there's no job that she is disqualified from by saying yes I believe it was correctly decided right that is nothing bad will happen to anyone who answers that question what about Plessy versus Ferguson they get that one right earlier yeah yeah well yeah that's yeah she wouldn't know that one right so let's get to the issue of reproductive rights in the past Vitter has given speeches in regard to Planned Parenthood and has out just lied about what Planned Parenthood does so for instance I'll give you an example of a quote from a previous speech that she had given she said and I quote Planned Parenthood says they promote women's health it is the saddest of ironies that they kill over a hundred fifty thousand females a year the first step in promoting women's health is to let them live so she was asked about that among other reproductive rights related questions here's how she handled handled those questions take a look you density yourself do you consider yourself to be pro-life now yes senator I am pro-life unqualifiedly pro-life senator I can only speak for myself I I am pro-life so you are against a woman's exercise of reproductive rights as guaranteed by the United States Constitution so there was more to that exchange and we'll get to that in just a second but I want you guys to jump in I like this thing where she at that moment where she sought to distance herself from that panel this 2013 panel called abortion hurts women and the brochure promoted a variety of unsubstantiated claims I'm reading from NPR here linking birth control pills to breast cancer cervical and liver cancers and quote violent death right so at this on this last point violent death the brochure alleged that women who take oral contraceptives prefer men with similar DNA so if you take the pill you you respond to men with similar DNA and that women in these partnerships have you were sexual relations leading to more adultery and quote understandably violence yep she's a lunchbox yeah this is a common tactic common strategy used by these pregnancy crisis centers they make themselves appear to be a clinics much like Planned Parenthood for instance and women unwittingly go to these clinics thinking that they could get abortion services there and unfortunately they're met with people pretending to be doctors they're not even medical professionals usually they're wearing you know the white doctors outfit I don't know what it's called coat and and then they're told all sorts of misinformation if you have an abortion you will risk higher chances of breast cancer it's it's dangerous it's unsafe and then they pressure the women to you know bring the pregnancy to term that is a common thing that happens here in the United States pregnancy crisis centers they lie to women they lure them in by pretending like there's something that they're not and then they give them all sorts of misinformation to scare them so to be clear that was in a brochure at a 2013 conference didn't and she encouraged people to hand out you words the audience this is mazie Hirono of Hawaii saying that she urged the audience to distribute the materials making these outrageous these dangerous claims do you believe the claims that abortion cause breast cancer and birth control causes women to be assaulted and murdered because they have they're attracted right similar Sanatana you understand the scientist yeah bitter asserted she had no background and that she was not a medical professional god bless and had never heard those opinions opinion before and and senator Hirono said you called them facts bitter says I did say facts but I stopped myself and I said brochure by the way and she was asked just now by Blumenthal do you consider yourself pro-life and she said well I can only speak for myself yeah yeah that's that's what we're asking here so here's what she did say on in the clip by the way go to dr. Angela's website breast cancer prevention Institute downloaded and your next physical walk into your pro-life doctor and say have you thought about putting these facts or this brochure in your waiting room they're not facts they have been disproven time and time again again it's just a way to scare with and pressure them to bring a pregnancy to term a pregnancy that they don't want and like say a call girl got pregnant well for example let's let's just fill the audience in on that so her husband this is a very Family Values oriented couple okay so Wendy Vitter and her husband very right-wing consider themselves hardcore Christians her husband apparently had an affair am i correct not apparently he had it he had it he used call girls yeah it was a who used a was the Washington madam what was she called the DC madam the DC madam right okay if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying give them like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me TYT Network comm slash joy
