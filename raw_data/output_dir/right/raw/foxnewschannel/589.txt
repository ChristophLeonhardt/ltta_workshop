HERE.

18
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:32,913
THE BOOK, ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS

19
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:33,814
TRUE OR NOT.

20
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:40,887
THAT THE TAPE WAS OF THE TRUMP

00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:42,656
USING THE N-WORD.

22
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:43,323
SOMEONE WHO KNEW FRANK LUNTZ

23
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:51,732
TOLD HER THAT HE HAD HEARD IT.

24
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:52,466
THE LONGTIME TRUMP AIDE REPORTED

25
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:53,200
SHE ASKED TRUMP ABOUT IT ON THE

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,246
DID THAT HAPPEN?

31
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:06,713
>> NO.

32
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:07,814
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S WRITING A

33
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:09,249
SCRIPT FOR A MOVIE.

34
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,417
I'VE BEEN OUT THERE TALKING

35
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,991
I HAVE NO CONNECTIONS TO ANYONE

36
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:19,126
AT "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE," OTHER

37
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:19,626
THAN OMAROSA.

38
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:22,229
IN FACT, SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE

39
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:34,941
DESPERATE SITUATION.

40
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:37,611
I REALLY DO FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

41
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:42,516
I WAS REALLY CONCERNED WITH

42
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:43,950
OMAROSA WHEN SHE GOT MARRIED,

43
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,385
WHEN SHE HAD TO BUY A FAKE

44
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:48,855
BUT I WILL NOT STAND BY AND

45
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:51,892
ALLOW HER TO CONTINUE TO TARNISH

46
00:01:58,833 --> 00:01:59,800
>> Ed: WE GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO

47
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,133
RESPOND.

48
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:01,568
I WANT TO GET TO THE NEW

49
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,637
INFORMATION BUT FIRST, I WANT TO

50
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:05,272
BE CLEAR, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THE

51
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:06,239
PRESIDENT DURING THE CAMPAIGN,

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,808
SINCE THE CAMPAIGN, SINCE HE WAS

53
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:08,308
ELECTED PRESIDENT.

54
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:10,243
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD HIM USE THE

55
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:12,746
N-WORD, ANY SORT OF RACIAL SLUR?

56
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:13,613
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

57
00:02:13,614 --> 00:02:14,448
THE ANSWER IS NO.

58
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:16,316
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

59
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:18,852
FAMILY HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT

60
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:20,420
KIND, GENEROUS, AND RESPECTFUL

61
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,121
TO MYSELF AND EVERYBODY ELSE

62
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:22,656
THAT I KNOW OF COLOR OF COLOR.

63
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:33,967
DEVELOPMENT, LONGTIME TRUMP

64
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:37,204
ADVISOR, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

65
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:37,604
GOVERNMENT.

66
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:38,338
I UNDERSTAND SHE'S PUTTING OUT A

67
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,606
STATEMENT THIS HOUR THAT IS

68
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:40,173
REFUTING THESE CLAIMS.

69
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,208
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?

70
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,211
>> AS I MENTIONED, OMAROSA WAS

71
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:47,247
THE SOURCE OF THIS TAPE, SHE WAS

72
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,983
CAMPAIGN.

73
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,585
IN MY OPINION, AS A TOOL OF

74
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:52,352
MANIPULATION OF THE PEOPLE

75
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:52,986
AROUND HER.

76
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:54,154
SHE HAS BEEN MENTIONING LYNNE

77
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,359
INTERVIEWS AS SOMEONE WHO COULD

78
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:03,363
HAS RELEASED A STATEMENT THIS

79
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:05,632
EVENING AND SHE HAS GIVEN AN

80
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:08,802
>> IT'S RUNNING IN

81
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:13,473
MORE IMPORTANTLY, ED, IT'S THE

82
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:14,374
TIMELINE.

83
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,509
THE REASON WHY OMAROSA IS FACING

84
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,478
A RAPID CONTRADICTIONS IS

85
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,713
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP HER

86
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:20,213
LICENSE STRAIGHT.

87
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:20,914
SHE'S GOT OUT THERE AND SAID

88
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:23,984
THAT SHE HAS NOT HEARD THE TAPES

89
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:25,752
UNTIL HER BOOK WAS FINALIZED.

90
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:27,788
WHATEVER HE WANTED IT NOW AND

91
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:28,588
WHAT LYNNE PATTON IS ANNOUNCING

92
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:29,156
TONIGHT --

93
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:30,390
>> Ed: THAT IS LYNNE PATTON

94
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:30,791
RIGHT THERE.

95
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,392
JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.

96
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:44,371
A PHONE CALL SHE SAYS, OMAROSA

97
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:46,573
TOLD HER THEN THAT SHE HAD HEARD

98
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,208
THE TAPE WHERE THE PRESIDENT

99
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,676
ALLEGEDLY SAID THE N-WORD.

100
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,611
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE NOW IN

101
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,313
RECENT DAYS, OMAROSA HAS SAID

102
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,749
THAT SHE HAS NOT HEARD IT UNTIL

103
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,418
AFTER WRITING HER BOOK.

104
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,119
DECEMBER 12, 2017, SHE HADN'T

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,153
WRITTEN THE BOOK AND SHE WAS

106
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:00,887
STILL IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

107
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,189
THAT IS OF A CONTRADICTION.

108
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,424
IS THAT WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING

109
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:04,991
IS TONIGHT?

110
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,827
>> IT'S A MAJOR CONTRADICTION.

111
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:07,828
IT'S A BOMBSHELL, LYNNE PATTON.

112
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,932
TWO DAYS AFTER THAT, SHE WENT ON

113
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,967
ABC NEWS INTERVIEW DEFENDING A

114
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,802
PRESIDENT, SAYING, "THAT HE IS

115
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:16,536
NOT A RACIST."

116
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,237
SO HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE IF

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,172
SHE HEARD THE TAPE ALREADY, THAT

118
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,574
SHE WAS USING AS THEIR EXCUSE TO

119
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,177
>> Ed: ANOTHER QUICK POINT I

120
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:25,612
WANT TO MAKE.

121
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,415
MARK BURNETT, TOP -- ONE OF THE

122
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,283
CREATORS OF "THE APPRENTICE,"

123
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:33,854
EXISTS.

124
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:40,427
BILL PRUITT, ANOTHER PRODUCER ON

125
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:40,961
"THE APPRENTICE" IS

126
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:41,595
CORROBORATING HER STORY.

127
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,765
>> BILL PRUITT WAS THE PRODUCER

128
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,334
OF SEASONS ONE AND TWO, WHERE

129
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:49,636
SHE IS CLAIMING THAT THIS

130
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,204
APPARENTLY TOOK PLACE.

131
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:52,505
SHE ALSO TOLD LYNNE PATTON THAT

132
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:55,575
BILL PRUITT WAS HER ORIGINAL

133
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:56,977
SOURCE OF THE TAPE, AND LYNNE

134
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:57,911
PATTON SPOKE WITH BILL THIS

135
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:58,645
EVENING AND IS ANNOUNCING THAT

136
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:01,982
THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE AND AS I

137
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:04,784
SUSPECTED, ALL ALONG, THIS TAPE

138
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,386
DOES NOT EXIST.

139
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:07,187
OMAROSA EXTRAS DESPERATE FOR

140
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:07,988
MONEY FOR MONEY.

141
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:09,222
>> Ed: ALL RIGHT.

142
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:09,789
LAST QUESTION.

143
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,557
YOU ARE AT HER WEDDING.

144
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:13,693
THERE ARE PHOTOS OF YOU ONLINE

145
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:14,728
HAVING FUN WITH OMAROSA.

146
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,997
I KNOW PEOPLE, FRIENDS, THEY

WHITE HOUSE.

150
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:25,105
THE PRESIDENT AND THE CAMPAIGNS

151
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,406
THAT HE WAS GOING TO HIRE THE

152
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:27,674
BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST, THAT HE

155
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:31,711
HE'S HAD PROBLEMS NOW WITH

156
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:32,312
MICHAEL COHEN AS WELL.

157
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:42,622
STATING THE FACT BRAIDS BE WHEN

158
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:43,590
YOU TALKED ABOUT HER RING --

159
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:45,158
>> I DID FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

160
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,426
>> Ed: YOU SAID IT WAS TRASH

161
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:46,793
FOR CASH.

162
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:48,428
I WANT TO BE CLEAR.

163
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,729
YOU'VE BEEN FRIENDS WITH HER AND

164
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,431
THE PRESIDENT HIRED HER TO A

165
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:52,632
SENSITIVE WHITE HOUSE POST,

166
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,434
BEING PAID ALMOST $200,000 A

167
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,635

ACHIEVE GREATNESS.

171
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,514
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN OUT THERE

172
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:09,149
CHAMPION HERE COMMUNITIES WITH A

173
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,983
