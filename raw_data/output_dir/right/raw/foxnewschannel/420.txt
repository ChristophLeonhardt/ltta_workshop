00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:03,120
TRACKED HIM DOWN.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,788
STEVE: BUT, THEY HAVE GOT

3
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:05,289
THEIR MAN.

4
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:05,923
MEANWHILE, HILLARY CLINTON

5
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,759
IS GOING BACK AFTER THE

6
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,694
DEPLORABLE THEME WITH SOME

7
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:15,399

00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:15,733
IN 2016.

9
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,201
>> HE HAS BEEN RACIST.

10
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:19,136
HE HAS BEEN SEXIST.

11
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:20,137
HE HAS BEEN ISLAMOPHOBIC.

12
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:23,274
HE HAS BEEN ANTI-LBGTQ.

13
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,575
I MEAN, THERE IS A LONG

14
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:24,909
LIST.

15
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:26,077
HE TALKS TO THAT AMERICA.

16
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:30,481
HE TALKS TO THEM ALL THE

17
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,016
TIME IT IS A VERY HARD CORE

18
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,819
WHO ARE RESPONDING TO HIM

19
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:39,991
AND SUPPORTING HIM.

20
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:40,591
AINSLEY: HILLARY CLINTON

21
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:42,393
RATTLING OFF LIST OF

22
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:42,727
INSULTS.

23
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:44,795
HERE TO REACT IS FOX NATION

24
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:45,897
HOST TOMI LAHREN.

25
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:47,298
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

26
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,401
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH

27
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:50,801
HILLARY.

28
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,402
AINSLEY: TUCKER CARLSON

29
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:52,970
SAYING THIS IS DEPLORABLE

30
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,237
2.0.

31
00:00:53,237 --> 00:00:54,472
ATTACKING THE PEOPLE WHO

32
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,139
VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

33
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:55,606
IT SOUNDS LIKE.

34
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:57,108
>> WELL, YOU GUYS ARE

35
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:58,376
EXACTLY RIGHT.

36
00:00:58,376 --> 00:00:59,677
EARLIER, WHEN SHE IS

37
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:00,411
ATTACKING PRESIDENT DONALD

38
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:00,711
TRUMP.

39
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,646
SHE IS ACTUALLY ATTACKING

40
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:02,880
AMERICANS AND SHE IS

41
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,848
ATTACKING HIS SUPPORTERS.

42
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:06,317
AND SHE COULDN'T BE MORE

43
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:06,751
TONE DEAF.

44
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:09,187
WHAT SHE IS REALLY DOING

45
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:10,555
WHEN SHE IS SAYING HE IS

46
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:11,289
RACIST AND DISTRACT FROM THE

47
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:12,557
POINT THAT BLACK

48
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:13,291
UNEMPLOYMENT IS HISTORIC

49
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:13,591
LOWS.

50
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,460
WHEN SHE IS SAYING HE IS

51
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,428
SEXIST TRYING TO DISTRACT

52
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:18,696
FROM THE G.D.P. GROWTH OVER

53
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:18,963
4%.

54
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:21,232
WHEN SHE SAYS HE IS

55
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:21,666
ISLAMOPHOBIC.

56
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,401
TRYING TO DISTRACT FROM THE

57
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,837
FACT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF

58
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:28,239
OVERSEEING THE ISIS.

59
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,309
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

60
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:31,876
AND DISTRACT VOTERS.

61
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:34,445
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

62
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:35,113
STEVE: MEANWHILE, TOMI, YOU

63
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:36,447
HAVE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF

64
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:37,348
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.

65
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,816
THEY HAVE TRIED TO DO THEIR

66
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,985
BEST, IT APPEARS, TO

67
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:41,619
DIMINISH JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

68
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:44,222
I KNOW THERE WAS A "U.S.A.

69
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:45,623
TODAY" OPINION PIECE THAT

70
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:46,457
SAID THAT KAVANAUGH SHOULD

71
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:47,859
STAY OFF THE BASKETBALL

72
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:48,393
COURTS.

73
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,295
HE SHOULD NOT BE COACHING

74
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:50,662
CHILDREN.

75
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:52,130
AND THEN THERE WAS A CARTOON

76
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,099
THAT WAS WIDELY CIRCULATED

77
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,434
THAT SHOWED KAVANAUGH'S

78
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:57,202
10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER PRAYING

79
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:58,002
FOR DR. FORD.

80
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:00,505
AND THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.

81
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:01,706
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING

82
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:04,375
ON HERE?

83
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,611
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME IS ALL IN

84
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:09,547
ON KILLING KAVANAUGH.

85
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,014
>> IMAGINE THAT OF COURSE.

86
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:11,716
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS ALL

87
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:14,018
IN ON KILLING ANYTHING THAT

88
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,220
HAS TO DO WITH PRAWFN AND

89
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,988
KAVANAUGH IS JUST ANOTHER

90
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:18,957
SYMPTOM OF OF THAT TRUMP

91
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:19,991
DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

92
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:20,625
FURTHERMORE, THEY ARE NOT

93
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,493
HELPING THEMSELVES BY DOING.

94
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,328
THIS ALL THEY ARE DOING FOR

95
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:24,963
KAVANAUGH SUPPORTERS, FOR

96
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:25,830
TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND

97
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,165
AMERICANS CONCERNED WITH DUE

98
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:27,499
PROCESS.

99
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:29,000
JUSTICE AND HAVING A GREAT

100
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,235
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

101
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:31,103
ALL THEY ARE DOING IN THE

102
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:33,839
MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND ON THE

103
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,574
LEFT ARE ENCOURAGING TRUMP

104
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:36,775
SUPPORTERS AND RED WAIVE TO

105
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,043
COME OUT IN FORCE.

106
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:39,011
WHAT THEY THINK THEY ARE

107
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:40,579
DOING IS CHANGING THE MINDS

108
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,381
OF VOTERS AND THINK THEY ARE

109
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,716
GOING TO MAKE A BLUE WAVE.

110
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:46,518
IN FACT WHAT THEY ARE DOING

111
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:47,553
IS STRENGTH THE RED WAVE,

112
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:50,622
THEY WILL SEE THAT IN

113
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:51,056
NOVEMBER.

114
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:51,657
BRIAN: REPUBLICANS ARE

115
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:53,325
BEGINNING TO SURGE IN THE

116
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:53,992
GENERIC POLL.

117
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:54,793
WONDER HOW MUCH IS GOING TO

118
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:56,328
HINGE ON KAVANAUGH

119
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:57,796
ESPECIALLY HEIDI HEITKAMP

120
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:00,232
DOWN BY 10 POINTS IN NORTH

121
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:00,566
DAKOTA.

122
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:01,500
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR THERE

123
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,935
MIGHT SHE NOT HAVE A CHOICE

124
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:06,572
TO VOTE FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH?

125
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,140
>> I HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE

126
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,941
DEMOCRATS IN VULNERABLE

127
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,609
STATES LIKE NORTH DAKOTA ARE

128
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:11,510
REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO

129
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,645
WHAT'S GOING ON THIS DOESN'T

130
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:19,451
EVEN FALL ON PARTY LINES

131
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,187
AMERICANS ARE QUITE TIRED OF

132
00:03:22,187 --> 00:03:22,454
IT.

133
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:23,355
>> 344 MINUTES ON

134
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:23,989
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST

135
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,190
CAUSATIVE AMONGST THE

136
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,557
NETWORKS.

137
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:26,992
14 MINUTES ON KAVANAUGH'S

138
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:27,492
DENIALS.

139
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:28,794
AND THIS IS MEDIA RESEARCH

140
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:31,196
CENTER LOOKED AT ABC, CBS,

141
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:32,565
AND NTSB MORNING AND EVENING

142
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:33,766
NEWS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 13TH

143
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:34,834
AND THE 24TH.

144
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:36,068
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO

145
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:36,369
THAT?

146
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:37,837
IS THAT FAIR?

147
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:38,838
>> WELL, OF COURSE IT'S NOT

148
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:39,138
FAIR.

149
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:40,273
BUT I THINK OUT AMERICAN

150
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:41,707
PEOPLE GO OUTSIDE OF A LOT

151
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:43,242
OF THINGS FROM NEWS AS WELL.

152
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:44,410
THEY ARE LOOKING AT SOCIAL

153
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,877
MEDIA.

154
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:46,179
THEY AT WATCHING FOX NEWS TO

155
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:47,113
GET THE REAL STORY.

156
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:48,080
THEY ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO

157
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,981
OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE

158
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,049
ANALYSIS ON THIS.

159
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,318
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST THE

160
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:53,019
MAINSTREAM MEDIA.

161
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,487
THE LEFTIST MAINSTREAM MEDIA

162
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:54,954
ANYMORE.

163
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:55,888
AGAIN, THEY ARE SHOOTING

164
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:56,822
THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT WITH

165
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,124
THIS CONTINUOUS, NEGATIVE

166
00:03:58,124 --> 00:03:58,758
COVERAGE BECAUSE THE

167
00:03:58,758 --> 00:03:59,492
AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T WANT

168
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:01,093
TO SEE A GOOD MAN BE TREATED

169
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:01,794
THIS WAY.

170
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,162
DOESN'T MATTER IF HE IS

171
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:04,263
CONSERVATIVE, LIBERAL, OR IN

172
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,164
THE MIDDLE.

173
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:05,932
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT

174
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,366
WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN TO A

175
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,701
GOOD MAN.

176
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:09,468
STEVE: WELL, THE FBI REPORT

177
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:11,504
COULD BE SUBMITTED TO THE

178
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:12,772
ADMINISTRATION LATER TODAY.

179
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,173
COULD BE A VOTE LATER THIS

180
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:14,473
WEEK.

181
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:15,841
SO STAY TUNED.

182
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:16,576
TOMI, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

183
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:18,177
FOR JOINING US U OF COURSE,

184
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:19,345
ONE OF THE HOSTS FROM FOX

NATION.
