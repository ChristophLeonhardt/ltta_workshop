1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,172
>>> WE HAVE REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,007
ON THE FBI INVESTIGATION 

3
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,177
LOOKING INTO THE SUPREME COURT 

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,112
NOMINEE, BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:12,445
HIS RECORD. 

6
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,848
LET'S LISTEN IN.  

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:19,886
>>  THE SECOND THING WE KNOW 

8
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,154
FOR SURE IS THAT THERE IS NO 

9
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,822
WAY THAT ANYTHING WE DID WOULD 

10
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,757
SATISFY THE DEMOCRATS. 

11
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,761
THEY ALWAYS HAVE A REASON WHY 

12
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,728
THE GOALPOST NEEDS TO BE MOVED 

13
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:33,233
FURTHER DOWN THE FIELD. NOTHING 

14
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,803
WE COULD DO WOULD SATISFY THEM. 

15
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,738
YOU HAVE SEEN IT FROM THE 

16
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,640
BEGINNING AND WITH THAT, I WANT 

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,877
TO TURN IT OVER TO MEMBERS OF 

18
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,944
THE COMMITTEE WHO I THINK HAVE 

19
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,781
DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB. 

20
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:54,687
>>  BEFORE I SAY A FEW WORDS, 

21
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,956
SO THAT I WILL HAVE TO DOES NOT 

22
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,926
ANNOUNCE EACH PERSON, PLEASE 

23
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:07,233
JUST COME -- JUST SO THAT I DO 

24
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,134
NOT ANNOUNCE EACH PERSON, JUST 

25
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,302
COME TO THE PODIUM AND WE WILL 

26
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:09,702
TAKE QUESTIONS. 

27
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,704
THIS IS THE 87 DAY. THAT IS 

28
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,605
THREE WEEKS LONGER THAN THE 

29
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,774
AVERAGE OF THE LAST THREE OR 

30
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:18,445
FOUR NOMINEES TO THE SUPREME 

31
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:18,978
COURT. 

32
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,014
DO NOT TELL ME THAT WE HAVE NOT 

33
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,116
SPENT ENOUGH TIME. 

34
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,118
ALSO, I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT 

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,519
WHERE THIS NOMINATION IS RIGHT 

36
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:26,719
NOW. 

37
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,489
I DO NOT SAY THAT FROM THE 

38
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,456
STANDPOINT OF COUNTING VOTES. 

39
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,725
I SAY THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT 

40
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,128
OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THIS 

41
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,896
CANDIDATE AND THE FACT THAT 

42
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,199
THOSE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE A 

43
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,267
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BASED 

44
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,870
UPON HIS 12 YEARS ON THE D.C. 

45
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,173
CIRCUIT WITHOUT ANYBODY FINDING 

46
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,641
ANY FAULT WITH HIS 

47
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,778
QUALIFICATIONS TO SERVE BUT 

48
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,882
THAT HAS NOT BEEN TALKED ABOUT 

49
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:56,516
MUCH. 

50
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:56,916
EVERYTHING ELSE. 

51
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,151
THIS PERSON IS VERY WELL-

52
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,619
QUALIFIED. A PERSON THAT 

53
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,154
BELIEVES IN THE VEGETABLES OF 

54
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,623
DUE PROCESS AND THE PRESUMPTION 

55
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,493
OF INNOCENCE AND READINESS TO 

56
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,329
SERVE. SO, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

57
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:11,898
SHOULD BE CONFIRMED ON SATURDAY 

58
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:18,071
. NOW, THIS STARTED DOWNHILL 

59
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,074
VERY QUICKLY ON JULY 10 WHEN 

60
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,544
CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THAT WE WILL 

61
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,946
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP 

62
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,415
THIS NOMINATION. 

63
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,150
YOU CAN LOOK BACK 87 DAYS AND 

64
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,888
YOU CAN SEE THAT EVERYTHING BUT 

65
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,390
WHETHER HE IS QUALIFIED TO 

66
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,996
SERVE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP. 

67
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,230
I HAVE TRIED TO COMMIT AND I 

68
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,165
THINK I HAVE CARRIED OUT WHAT I 

69
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,967
PROMISED IMMEDIATELY. 

70
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,436
THAT WE WILL HAVE A FAIR AND 

71
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,739
THOROUGH PROCESS. 

72
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,574
WE HAVE HAD A FAIR AND THOROUGH 

73
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:58,011
PROCESS AND I THINK THAT IS 

74
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,948
BEST DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT 

75
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,316
THAT THE MINUTE I READ ABOUT 

76
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,952
WHO THE PERSON WAS IN THE 

77
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:10,557
FEINSTEIN LETTER WITH DOCTOR 

78
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:10,757
FORD. 

79
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,891
I READ ABOUT HER NAME IN THE 

80
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,126
PAPER AND WE GOT ON IT RIGHT 

81
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,361
AWAY TO PROVIDE WHAT SHE WANTED 

82
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,396
AND IN TURN, WE PROVIDED THE 

83
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,598
SAME FOR HIM FOR KAVANAUGH  -- 

84
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,769
FORUM FOR KAVANAUGH . WHAT I 

85
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,971
HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH IS THE 

86
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,873
DOWNHILL SLOPE THAT CHUCK 

87
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,076
SCHUMER HAS PUT US ON AND IT'S 

88
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,377
REALLY DEALING WITH THE 

89
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,947
DEMOLITION DERBY. 

90
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,884
THEY JUST ABOUT DESTROYED A 

91
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,653
GOOD PERSON TO BE ON THE 

92
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:47,627
SUPREME COURT. HOPEFULLY, WE 

93
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,861
ARE 48 HOURS AWAY FROM HAVING A 

94
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:57,103
NEW PERSON ON THE SUPREME COURT.

95
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:57,937
>> I CERTAINLY ENDORSE 

96
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,838
EVERYTHING THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF 

97
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,240
THE COMMITTEE HAS SAID.  

98
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,108
I AM DISAPPOINTED IN MY 

99
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,042
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES FOR WHAT 

100
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:03,442
THEY ARE DOING. 

101
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,044
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR IT BUT 

102
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,914
THEY ARE DOING IT. 

103
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,482
I AM GRATEFUL TO THE FBI FOR 

104
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,085
THEIR EFFORT IN DOING A THOROUGH

105
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,288
AND IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION. 

106
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,790
MANY OF US HAVE SAID THAT IF 

107
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,791
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DID WHAT HE WAS 

108
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,959
ACCUSED OF DOING  BY SOME OF 

109
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,931
THE DEMOCRATS AND OUTSIDE PEOPLE

110
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,234
, HE SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED. 

111
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,435
AFTER INVESTIGATIONS FROM BOTH 

112
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,972
OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE FBI, 

113
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,475
WE HAVE FOUND ABSOLUTELY 

114
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,278
NOTHING TO CORROBORATE  

115
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,279
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM. 

116
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,783
WE NEED TO CONFIRM HIM RIGHT 

117
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,251
AWAY. 

118
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,619
THIS CONFIRMATION WILL BE A 

119
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,988
VICTORY FOR THE SENATE AS AN 

120
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,291
INSTITUTION AND A REMINDER THAT 

121
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,760
THE POLITICS ARE BASELESS AND 

122
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,061
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION HAS NO 

123
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,799
PLACE HERE. 

124
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,303
I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE BEST 

125
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,270
NOMINEES THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN 

126
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,104
IN MY 42 YEARS IN THE U. S. 

127
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:07,874
SENATE. I APOLOGIZE TO HIM FOR 

128
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,009
THE WAY HE HAS BEEN TREATED. 

129
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,376
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POSITION 

130
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:13,446
AND DEMOCRATS DO HAVE A RIGHT 

131
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:18,584
TO FEEL WORRIED AND UPSET ABOUT 

132
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,420
A REPUBLICAN GETTING THE SEAT 

133
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,854
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD 

134
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,822
WON THE ELECTION BUT THAT IS 

135
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:27,660
NOT THE CASE AND OUR SIDE HAS 

136
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,799
HANDLED THIS WITH DISCRETION, 

137
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,899
HANDLING EVERY PROBLEM THAT HAS 

138
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:37,303
COME UP AND FRANKLY, I HOPE WE 

139
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,804
CAN MOVE FORWARD AND GET THIS 

140
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,773
DONE. 

141
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,509
IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND 

142
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,911
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A GREAT 

143
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,447
JUDGE  AND HE WILL MAKE A GREAT 

144
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,948
JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT 

145
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,583
AND I INTEND TO DO EVERYTHING I 

146
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,084
CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT HE GETS 

147
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:58,624
THERE AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN. 

148
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:03,062
>> OUR FRIEND , THE SENIOR 

149
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:06,833
SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA SAID 

150
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,466
ABOUT THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS 

151
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:08,601
-- SHE SAID THIS IS NOT NORMAL 

152
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,937
AND I AGREE WITH HER. 

153
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,874
IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL, 

154
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,879
WHILE TO THE SENATE AND ANY 

155
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,980
NOMINEE THAT WOULD BE SUBJECTED 

156
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,883
TO THE UNACCEPTABLE CHARACTER 

157
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,651
ASSASSINATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN 

158
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,220
DIRECTED AT THIS NOMINEE WITH 

159
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,588
THIS CASE. 

160
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,156
IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL, I DO 

161
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:32,191
NOT KNOW WHO WOULD WANT TO 

162
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,194
SERVE AND I THINK PEOPLE WOULD 

163
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:35,895
BE JUSTIFIED IN LIVING ANY 

164
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,796
RESPECT FOR THE SENATE AND THE 

165
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,631
WAY IT CONDUCTS ITS SELF IN THE 

166
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,432
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 

167
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,935
MORE IS AT STAKE THAN JUST THIS 

168
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,370
NOMINATION. 

169
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,871
THE SENATE ITSELF IS ON TRIAL 

170
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:49,208
HERE. 

171
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,042
A VOTE AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

172
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:50,743
TOMORROW WOULD BE AN 

173
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,843
ENDORSEMENT  WITH THE 

174
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:54,046
MISHANDLING OF THIS 

175
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,983
CONFIRMATION PROCESS BECAUSE OF 

176
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,652
HIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION 

177
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,553
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXAMINED 

178
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,388
ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IN A WAY 

179
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,456
THAT RESPECTED DOCTOR FORD TO 

180
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:10,363
REQUEST FOR PRIVACY -- DOCTOR 

181
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:15,768
FORD'S REQUEST FOR PRIVACY. 

182
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,872
A VOTE AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

183
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,308
WOULD BE A VOTE FOR ABUSING THE 

184
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,876
CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND A GOOD 

185
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,679
PERSON AND IT WILL BE A VOTE 

186
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,946
FOR THE SHAMEFUL INTIMIDATION 

187
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,715
TACTICS THAT HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED 

188
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,985
AS PART OF AN ORCHESTRATED 

189
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,386
SMEAR CAMPAIGN. 

190
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:37,490
I AGREE THAT THE FBI 

191
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,091
INVESTIGATION, THEY HAVE TALKED 

192
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,195
TO 150 DIFFERENT PEOPLE THROUGH 

193
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,964
THE SEVEN BACKGROUND 

194
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,799
INVESTIGATIONS THAT JUDGE 

195
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,800
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN THROUGH 

196
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:59,879
SINCE 1993 . NO COOPERATION -- 

197
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,547
CORROBORATION. 

198
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,082
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS COULD HAVE 

199
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,951
BEEN AVOIDED WITH MOST OF THE 

200
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,119
EMBARRASSMENT TO DOCTOR FORD 

201
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,523
AND THE PUBLIC CIRCUS -LIKE 

202
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,891
ATMOSPHERE IS THE RANKING 

203
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,093
NUMBER HAD JUST MADE THE 

204
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,494
ALLEGATIONS KNOWN IN THE 

205
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:18,898
REGULAR PROCESS IN A WAY THAT 

206
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,167
WOULD HAVE PROTECTED HER AND 

207
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,836
HER CONFIDENTIALITY. 

208
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,638
I HAVE SAID BEFORE AND I WILL 

209
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,606
SAY AGAIN THAT I BELIEVE THAT 

210
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,709
WE SHOULD AND WE DID TREAT 

211
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,977
DOCTOR FORD IN THE SAME MANNER 

212
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,977
THAT I WOULD WANT MY DAUGHTERS 

213
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:35,780
TREATED OR MY WIFE BUT WE HAVE 

214
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,316
TO REMEMBER THAT JUDGE 

215
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:42,087
KAVANAUGH  IS ENTITLED TO A 

216
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,356
FAIR PROCESS AS WELL AND HE HAS 

217
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,957
NOT BEEN SUBJECTED TO A FAIR 

218
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:45,257
PROCESS. 

219
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,425
ANYTHING BUT. 

220
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,694
NOW IS THE TIME TO QUIT ALL OF 

221
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,797
THE ANTICS AND HIJINKS AND THE 

222
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,668
SURFACE -- THE CIRCUS LIKE 

223
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:55,968
ATMOSPHERE. 

224
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,271
WE WILL DO THAT TOMORROW AND 

225
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:00,372
SATURDAY WHEN WE FINALLY VOTE 

226
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,675
TO CONFIRM THIS FINE MAN IN 

227
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:07,579
THIS IMPORTANT POSITION. 

228
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:08,648
>> THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE 

229
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,249
FBI REPORTS  THAT WE HAVE 

230
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:14,987
RECEIVED THIS MORNING HAS BEEN 

231
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,522
EXHAUSTIVE. IT HAS BEEN A 

232
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,892
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH MY 

233
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,562
COLLEAGUES AND IT OCCURRED IN A 

234
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,195
CLASSIFIED ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE 

235
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:23,863
THESE WERE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE 

236
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,298
NOT ALLOWED TO BE DISCLOSED TO 

237
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:25,631
THE PUBLIC. 

238
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,467
BECAUSE WE CAN REVIEW THEM IN 

239
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,770
ONLY ONE PLACE, WE REVIEWED 

240
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,770
THEM TOGETHER AND WE STOPPED 

241
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,272
AND TALKED ABOUT EACH POINT 

242
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,108
MADE TO MADE SURE -- TO MAKE 

243
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,010
SURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD EACH 

244
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:45,551
INTERVIEW AND EACH REPORT. 

245
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,652
ALTHOUGH THAT PART OF IT BY 

246
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,653
OPERATION OF LAW IS NOT ALLOWED 

247
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,854
TO BE PUBLIC, I WANT TO GIVE 

248
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:49,722
YOU THE ASSURANCE THAT WE 

249
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,556
TREATED THESE DOCUMENTS JUST AS 

250
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,623
WE HAVE TREATED EACH AND EVERY 

251
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:52,123
ALLEGATION WITH UTMOST 

252
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:53,326
SERIOUSNESS AND A DESIRE TO DO 

253
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,561
NOTHING MORE THAN SEARCH FOR 

254
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,062
THE TRUTH. 

255
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,229
AS WE HAVE SPENT HOURS UPON 

256
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,067
HOURS WITH HEARING TESTIMONY IN 

257
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:01,934
THE OPEN HEARINGS BEFORE THE 

258
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,469
PUBLIC, WE HAVE ALSO HAD HOURS 

259
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,137
UPON HOURS REVIEWING THE 

260
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,472
DOCUMENTS IN A CLASSIFIED 

261
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,440
ENVIRONMENT. 

262
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,742
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

263
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,613
ARE SERIOUS AND SEXUAL ASSAULT, 

264
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,914
THEY ARE OF THE MOST SERIOUS 

265
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,616
NATURE AND HAVE TO BE TREATED 

266
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,551
WITH UTMOST SERIOUSNESS. 

267
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,487
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS CASE. 

268
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,555
AGAIN, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS 

269
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,789
BEEN THROUGH SEVEN BACKGROUND 

270
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,959
INVESTIGATIONS IN THE COURSE OF 

271
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,228
THE LAST THREE DECADES. 

272
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,930
WITH OVER 150 PEOPLE 

273
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,767
INTERVIEWED WITH REGARD TO HIM. 

274
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,767
THIS IS A MAN OF OUTSTANDING 

275
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,604
CHARACTER WHO HAS LIVED AN 

276
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,204
EXEMPLARY LIFE. 

277
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:45,511
HE HAD HIS FAMILY -- HE AND HIS 

278
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,445
FAMILY HAVEN'T OBJECTED TO A 

279
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,112
LOT OF HUMILIATION AND 

280
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:50,883
QUESTIONING IN THE RECENT WEEKS.

281
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,117
THAT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT PART 

282
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:53,819
OF THIS PROCESS FOR HIM BUT IN 

283
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,488
THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT, HE 

284
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,492
HAS PROVEN HIS CHARACTER AND 

285
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,893
WILLINGNESS TO BE CANDID WITH 

286
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,928
THE PUBLIC AND EVEN SHARING 

287
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,563
FACTS THAT ARE AT TIMES 

288
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,198
UNCOMFORTABLE. 

289
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,833
I AM CONVINCED OF THIS MAN'S 

290
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:13,872
CHARACTER AND HISTORY SLOWNESS 

291
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:14,740
AND QUALIFICATIONS TO SERVE ON 

292
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,775
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 

293
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,542
STATES AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY 

294
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,209
SUPPORT HIS CONFIRMATION AND 

295
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,244
LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR HIM 

296
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:22,014
IN THE COMING HOURS. 

297
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,982
>> I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING MY 

298
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,350
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID . I ALSO 

299
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,721
WANT TO SAY THAT DOCTOR FORD, I 

300
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,588
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT SHE DID 

301
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,389
EXPERIENCE A TRAUMATIC EVENT IN 

302
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,158
HER LIFE BUT I ALSO BELIEVE 

303
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,125
THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT 

304
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,961
WE HAVE SEEN TO THE FBI 

305
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,296
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE TIME 

306
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,064
THAT WE HAVE SPENT IN THE 

307
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:43,835
HEARING TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT 

308
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:44,502
THESE CLAIMS ARE PROPERLY 

309
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:45,771
ALLEGED AND DIRECTED TOWARDS 

310
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,372
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

311
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,941
THOUSANDS OF PAGES IN THAT 

312
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,876
BRIEFING ROOM, CENTERED ONLY 

313
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,677
AND I WERE IN THAT ROOM FOR AN 

314
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:58,017
HOUR AND AT THE DESK IS ALSO 

315
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:02,054
SOME 1500 PAGES THAT DOCUMENT 

316
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:06,192
THE FBI INVESTIGATIONS AND 

317
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,626
ANOTHER OF THOSE WAS THERE ANY 

318
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,128
REFERENCE -- KEEP IN MIND THIS 

319
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,697
GOES BACK 23 TO 24 YEARS. 

320
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,532
THIS WOULD ONLY BE SIX OR SEVEN 

321
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,867
YEARS AFTER HE WAS OUT OF 

322
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,568
COLLEGE AND CERTAINLY IF IT WAS 

323
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,370
RECENT MEMORY, YOU WOULD SEE 

324
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,672
SOME SUGGESTION BUT THERE WAS 

325
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,307
NONE. 

326
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,942
THE LAST THING I WILL LEAVE YOU 

327
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,245
WITH IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT 

328
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:32,218
SINCE MY COLLEAGUES ARE NOT 

329
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,785
ABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE 

330
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:38,858
ALLEGATIONS BUT THEY HAVE MOVED 

331
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:39,825
TO THIS NARRATIVE OF THE WAY 

332
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,093
THAT HE BEHAVED IN THE HEARING 

333
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,060
LAST WEEK AND IT WAS SOMEHOW 

334
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,896
PUT INTO QUESTION HIS JUDICIAL 

335
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,965
TEMPERAMENT. IN THE 31 HOURS 

336
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,335
THAT HE WAS BEFORE THE 

337
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,837
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, I SAW 

338
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:52,237
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

339
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:54,673
HE WAS ACTUALLY PATIENT  WITH 

340
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,041
UNFAIR QUESTIONS AND BEING CUT 

341
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,644
OFF BUT HE MAINTAINED HIS POISE 

342
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,746
THROUGHOUT THE 32 HOURS WITH 

343
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,014
VERY FEW BREAKS. 

344
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:06,018
LAST WEEK, I SAW BRETT 

345
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:06,318
KAVANAUGH. 

346
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,386
I WAS NOT JUDGING HIM AS A 

347
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:11,190
JUDGE  BUT A HUMAN BEING HE WAS 

348
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,790
HAVING HIS LIFE DESTROYED 

349
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,826
BEFORE HIS VERY EYES AND HAVING 

350
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,127
HIS DAUGHTER HEARTBROKEN AND 

351
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:22,735
HIS WIFE ISSUED DEATH THREATS. 

352
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,869
IF ANYONE IN THIS ROOM HAD GONE 

353
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,172
TO THE SAME EXPERIENCE, YOU 

354
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:27,973
WOULD HAVE THE SAME EMOTIONS 

355
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,008
AND DID THE COURSE OF THAT 

356
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,809
TESTIMONY, I THINK HE STILL 

357
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,712
COMPOSED HIMSELF AND DID A GOOD 

358
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,613
JOB IN ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS 

359
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,983
AND DEFENDING HIS GOOD NAME. 

360
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:42,321
>> WE ARE READY FOR QUESTIONS . 

361
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:50,362
>>  CAN YOU TELL US HOW YOU 

362
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,563
CAME UP WITH THE LIST OF WHO 

363
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:52,364
SHOULD BE INTERVIEWED BY THE 

364
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:52,665
FBI? 

365
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,301
>>  I THINK I WILL LET YOU DO 

366
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,368
THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE AT THE 

367
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,235
SAME MEETING I WAS AT. 

368
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:58,704
>> WE DID NOT COME UP WITH A

FBI SHOULD INTERVIEW. 

371
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,876
THE FBI WAS JUST TO CONDUCT AN

MISCONDUCT BY DOES KAVANAUGH  

376
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,282
AND THE FBI MADE THAT DECISION 

377
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:17,890
AS TO WHO TO INTERVIEW.

I REQUEST WAS TO THE WHITE

383
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,976
REQUEST OF THE FBI TO CONDUCT 

384
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,179

SEXUAL WAS CONDUCT. 

387
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:46,352
THEY DID THAT. 

388
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,886
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE DID NOT 

389
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,354
GIVE THEM A LIST OF PEOPLE  

390
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:50,355
WILL AND ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT 

391
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,725
THEY CAN SPEAK WITH. 

392
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,959
WE HAVE THEM GO BACK TO THOSE 

393
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,394
THAT ISSUED STATEMENTS AND PART 

394
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,331
OF THE PROTOCOL IS IF THERE'S 

395
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,500
ANYONE ELSE TO SPEAK TO. 

396
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,068
THEY IDENTIFIED OTHERS THAT PUT 

397
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,638
FORWARD STATEMENTS BEFORE AND 

398
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,306
WE SAW THAT IN THE RECORD THIS 

399
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,476
MORNING.

COOPERATE -- CORROBORATE THIS  

403
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,958
AND TO TELL THE WHITE HOUSE TO 

404
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,693
DO THIS FBI INVESTIGATION. 

405
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:33,699
>> THE FBI HAS  GOTTEN ALL OF 

406
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,666
THE PERSON THEY NEED IN ORDER 

407
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,567
TO INTERVIEW WHOEVER THEY THINK 

408
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:35,901
IS NECESSARY. 

409
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:41,407
THERE HAS BEEN NO ONE TO

CORROBORATE'S ALLEGATIONS BY 

411
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,974
DOCTOR FORD OR MISS RAMIREZ AND 

412
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,977
THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED BACK TO 

413
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,913
US. 

414
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,980
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS IS 

415
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,348
THE WAY. 

416
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,516
THIS WAS NOT A SEARCH FOR THE 

417
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:50,749
TRUTH. 

418
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,652
IT BECAME CLEAR EARLY ON WHEN 

419
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,788
THIS WAS HIDDEN FROM THE 

420
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,892
COMMITTEE AND HANDLED IN SUCH 

421
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,660
THIS WAY AGAINST HER WISHES, 

422
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,928
THIS IS A SEARCH AND DESTROY 

423
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:03,194
MISSION. 

424
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:05,130
NOT SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH. 

425
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,765
WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN 

426
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,600
TO TREAT BOTH JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

427
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,969
AND DOCTOR FORD  FAIRLY AND TO 

428
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,104
TREAT ALL ALLEGATIONS MADE 

429
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,039
SERIOUSLY AND IT HAS BEEN 

430
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,544
STUDIED BY THE FBI AS WELL IS 

431
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,178
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STAFF 

432
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,445
AND THERE IS NOT REALLY 

433
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:21,313
ANYTHING ELSE. 

434
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,516
>>  THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE 

435
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,084
SHOULD NOT EVEN BE A LITTLE 

436
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:27,786
DOUBT. 

437
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,590
ACCUSERS ARE SUGGESTING THAT 

438
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,758
THEY COULD QUADRATE THEIR 

439
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,428
STORIES -- CORROBORATE THEIR 

440
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,530

>>  OF PEOPLE HAVE TESTIFY 

442
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,468
CONTRARY TO IT THAT MISS RAMIREZ

443
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,836
AND DOCTOR FORD HAVE ALLEGED. 

444
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,004
THE WITNESSES THEY HAVE 

445
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,106
IDENTIFIED THING THEY WERE 

446
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,540
PRESENT AT THE EVENT HAVE ALL 

447
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,744
REFUTED THEIR ALLEGATIONS SO I 

448
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:56,047
THINKTHAT OUGHT TO SETTLE IT. 

449
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,449
>> ONE THING THAT WAS 

450
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:02,755
NOTICEABLE  WAS THAT IT WAS NOT 

451
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,856
CLEAR IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD GO 

452
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:11,530
TO COUNSEL BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS,

453
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,731
REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS, 

454
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,598
WHILE THE NEED TAKE ANYTHING 

455
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,667
BACK TO THE ATTORNEYS FOR 

456
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:20,439
DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 

457
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,776
OR WILL YOU REFER THEM TO THE 

458
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,077
AVA? 

459
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,444
>> RIGHT NOW I DO NOT KNOW WHEN 

460
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:27,813
I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE IS ANY 

461
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,580
REASON TO.  

462
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,915
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO -- THIS 

463
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:30,716
IS ALMOST ROCK-BOTTOM SO I 

464
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,085
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE FUTURE 

465
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,953
OF MENDING THINGS SO THAT WE 

466
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,555
CAN DO THINGS IN A COLLEGIAL 

467
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:41,593
WAY THAT THE SENDER OUGHT TO DO 

468
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,427
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES 

469
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:43,996
TO THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATION.

470
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,164
YOU FOLKS CAN HAVE SOMETHING TO 

471
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:45,731
DO WITH THIS. 

472
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,467
I WOULD NEVER USE THE WORD FAKE 

473
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,668
NEWS BECAUSE I CONSIDER YOU 

474
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,803
FOLKS POLICEMAN FOR OUR 

475
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:54,573
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT 

476
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,576
BUT SOME OF YOU DO HAVE BIAS. 

477
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,610
I HAVE HAD DEMONSTRATORS IN MY 

478
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,480
OFFICE FOR TWO WEEKS BOTH FOR 

479
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,048
KAVANAUGH AND AGAINST KAVANAUGH 

480
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,852
. ONE TIME, THE PEOPLE THAT 

481
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,053
WERE FOR KAVANAUGH  WANTED TO 

482
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,790
BE INTERVIEWED AND THEY SAID WE 

483
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,159
ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN 

484
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,794
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE AGAINST 

485
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,095
KAVANAUGH.  

486
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:22,835
THAT IS A BIAS. 

487
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,337
>>  THE LEGAL TEAM SENT A 

488
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,675
LETTER AND THEY ARE 

489
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:35,681
CHARACTERIZING THIS VISITATION 

490
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:41,587
-- [ INAUDIBLE COMMENT ] 

491
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,721
>> LET THE FBI DO WHAT THEY 

492
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,922
HAVE BEEN HIRED TO DO AND KEY 

493
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:44,756
POLITICAL INTERFERENCE OUT OF 

494
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:44,989
IT.  

495
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,191
MY MAKING A CALL TO THE FBI 

496
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,627
THAT YOU OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING, 

497
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,064
I MAY KNOW CALL TO THE FBI 

498
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:52,731
SINCE THIS WHOLE PROCESS 

499
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:57,002
STARTED A WEEK AGO AND I AM NOT 

500
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:57,402
GOING TO. 

501
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,237
I NEVER HAD ANY CONVERSATION 

502
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,271
WITH ANYONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

503
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,272
BECAUSE I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 

504
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:00,839
THE F VI. 

505
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,676
THEY GO WHERE THE FACTS LEAD. 

506
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,477
>> I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT 

507
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,414
TO CONSIDER THE SOURCE . THIS 

508
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,415
IS A LEGAL TEAM EMILY FORMALLY 

509
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,283
COMMUNICATED ON MORE THAN ONE 

510
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,951
OCCASION THAT WE WOULD COME TO 

511
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,287
CALIFORNIA AND HAVE AN 

512
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:21,459
INTERVIEW ON HER TERMS. DOCTOR 

513
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:22,628
FORD WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT AND 

514
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,231
IT MAKES ME WONDER OF THE 

515
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,799
COMPETENCE OF THE FOLKS THAT 

516
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,434
ARE ADVISING HER. 

517
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,838
>> EITHER  THE COMPETENCY OR 

518
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,240
POLITICAL BIAS THAT THEY HAVE. 

519
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:43,282
>>  [ INAUDIBLE COMMENT ] 

520
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:50,989
>>  NONE OF THIS HAS THAT 

521
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,192
PERSPECTIVE YET BUT I HOPE WHAT 

522
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,260
HISTORY DOCUMENTS IS WHAT I 

523
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,627
SAID EARLIER. 

524
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,796
ONCE WE LEARNED OF HER IDENTITY 

525
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,631
AND ONCE HER NAME WAS LEE, 

526
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,501
CONTRARY TO HER WISHES AND 

527
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,403
CONSENT TO THE PUBLIC, SHE WAS 

528
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,572
FORCED TO TELL HER STORY NOT IN 

529
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,107
A SAFE SETTING BUT IN A CIRCUS 

530
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:12,144
LIKE ATMOSPHERE. I HOPE WE DID 

531
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,845
THE BEST THAT WE COULD IN THOSE 

532
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,046
AWFUL SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT 

533
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,649
HE -- TO TREAT HER WITH RESPECT 

534
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,885
AND DIGNITY BUT THAT DOES NOT 

535
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,653
MEAN THAT WE FORGET OUR BASIC 

536
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,591
CONCEPT OF FAIR PLAY WITH DUE 

537
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,124
PROCESS. 

538
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,259
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TRIED TO 

539
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,294
INTERVIEW EVERY WITNESS THAT 

540
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,998
HAS ANY ALLEGED KNOWLEDGE OF 

541
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:38,370
THE FACTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN 

542
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,670
THE PROCESS AND WHAT WE KNOW 

543
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:47,779
NOW IS THERE IS NO 

544
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,114
CORROBORATION, EVEN WITH THE 

545
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,850
PEOPLE THAT SHE HAS IDENTIFIED 

546
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,751
AS BEING AT THE SCENE. 

547
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,086
I THINK WE HAVE DONE THE BEST 

548
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,689
ESPECIALLY WITH THE MISHANDLING 

549
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,092
WITH THE RANKING NUMBER ON THIS 

550
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,995
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO TREAT 

551
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,563
EVERYONE FAIRLY. 

552
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,764
IT'S TIME NOW TO VOTE AND THAT 

553
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,466
IS WHAT WE WILL DO STARTING 

554
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:07,866
TOMORROW MORNING. 

555
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,469
>> I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING  

556
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,506
BEFORE YOU ASK YOUR QUESTION. 

557
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,440
AS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY TRIED 

558
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,908
CASES IN THE FEDERAL COURT 

559
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,577
SYSTEM AND IN FRONT OF TWO OF 

560
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:23,415
THE MOST NOTORIOUS JUDGES FOR 

561
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,319
OUR COUNTRY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW 

562
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,454
THAT I TAKE THIS STUFF VERY 

563
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:34,026
SERIOUSLY. I DO NOT KNOW THAT I 

564
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,594
HAVE EVER SEEN ANYBODY THAT 

565
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:40,198
WOULD EXCEED JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

566
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,833
AS A JUDGE IN THE FEDERAL COURT 

567
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,201
SYSTEM. 

568
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,339
I PERSONALLY RESENT WHAT HAS 

569
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,376
BEEN HEAPED UPON HIM. 

570
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,111
IT'S NOT RIGHT OR FAIR AND IT 

571
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:58,216
SENDS A MESSAGE TO EVERYBODY. 

572
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:02,187
THIS IS JUST WRONG. 

573
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:02,821
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE SOME 

574
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,425
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT CARE AND THEY 

575
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,359
KNOW THAT THESE JUDGES ON THE 

576
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,127
SUPREME COURT WILL HANDLE 

577
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:16,601
DIFFICULT ISSUES AND I AM SURE 

578
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,635
THAT WHEN THE JUDGES THERE ON 

579
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:18,503
THE SUPREME COURT, HE WILL 

580
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,904
DECIDE ISSUES THAT WILL 

581
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,006
TERRIBLY DISAPPOINT REPUBLICANS 

582
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,840
AND MAYBE TERRIBLY DISAPPOINT 

583
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,445
DEMOCRATS FROM TIME TO TIME BUT 

584
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,645
I KNOW ONE THING, HE IS HONEST 

585
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:28,714
AND HE WILL DECIDE BASED -- 

586
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,917
DECIDE CASES BASED UPON THE LAW 

587
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,318
AND HE WILL DO A GOOD JOB IN 

588
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:33,651
DOING IT. 

589
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,520
THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE FELT 

590
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,990
SO DEEPLY ABOUT THIS. 

591
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,059
FRANKLY, I RESENT THIS BUSINESS 

592
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,929
OF TAKING ON ANYBODY IN THE 

593
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,231
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC PARTY 

594
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:51,002
FOR A FEDERAL JUDGESHIP. IT'S 

595
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,370
REALLY IRRITATING AND THESE 

596
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,207
PEOPLE HAVE SPENT A LIFETIME 

597
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:57,042
GETTING AV RATINGS, THE HIGHEST 

598
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,878
RATING YOU CAN GET FROM THE 

599
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,014
SERVICE OF ATTORNEYS IN THIS 

600
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,116
COUNTRY. 

601
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:08,220
I HAVE THE HIGHEST RATING YOU 

602
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,254
CAN POSSIBLY HAVE SO I KNOW 

603
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,790
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. 

604
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,593
HERE IN UTAH AND BACK IN 

605
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:14,926
PENNSYLVANIA. 

606
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:15,627
THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO 

607
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:15,793
ME. 

608
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,996
WHEN I GOT UP TO PRACTICE LAW 

609
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:25,704
IN UTAH, I WAS TOLD THAT 

610
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,705
JUDGE'S WINTER WAS WHEN YOU HAD 

611
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,775
TO WATCH BUT I GOT ALONG WITH 

612
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:35,781
HIM. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT 

613
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,917
POSITION IN THIS MAN IS 

614
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,920
QUALIFIED AND TO PUT HIM THROUGH

615
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,358
THIS TYPE OF A MESS JUST BECAUSE

616
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,294
THEY ARE UNHAPPY THAT DONALD 

617
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,295
TRUMP HAD THE RIGHT TO APPOINT 

618
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,497
HIM IS JUST PLAIN WRONG. 

619
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:57,002
I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM PROUD 

620
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:57,835
OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR STANDING 

621
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:00,638
UP ON THIS ISSUE AND WE ALL 

622
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:01,673
OUGHT TO BE STANDING UP ON 

623
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,007
THESE ISSUES. 

624
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,776
WE WANT COMPETENT FEDERAL JUDGES

625
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:09,548
WHO WERE NOT BIAS AND WILL 

626
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,517
ABIDE BY THE LAWS THEMSELVES. 

627
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,020
THIS MAN IS ONE OF THOSE. 

628
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,791
>> LAST QUESTION.  

629
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,795
>>  WILL THE PUBLIC EVER GET 

630
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:28,667
ANY SORT OF A SUMMARY OF THIS? 

631
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,202
>> TELL HER ABOUT THE RULE.  

632
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:33,638
>> IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO US  IN 

633
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,807
THE MEMORANDUM OF 2009 BETWEEN 

634
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:42,347
OBAMA AND THE CHAIRMAN THAT 

635
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,083
THERE IS ONE DOCUMENT AND NO 

636
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:50,822
COPIES MADE AND NOT RELEASED TO 

637
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,891
THE PUBLIC. 

638
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,792
SO, WE CANNOT DO THAT. 

639
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:59,764
THERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT 

640
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,199
THE WHITE HOUSE CAN DO IT BUT 

641
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,133
YOU WILL HAVE TO GO TO THE 

642
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,168
WHITE HOUSE TO GET THAT ANSWER 

643
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:10,375
TO YOUR QUESTION. 

644
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,242
>> SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT 

645
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:12,076
HOLDING BACK SAYING THE PROCESS 

646
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,545
IS FAIR  AND THOROUGH WHEN 

647
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,078
INVESTIGATING NEW CLAIMS 

648
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,513
AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT 

649
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,482
NOMINEE. 

650
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,516
I WANT TO BRING IN THE 

651
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,784
POLITICAL REPORTER WHO JOINS ME 

652
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:25,056
NOW. THE BIG DEVELOPMENT THIS 

653
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,024
AFTERNOON HAS BEEN AT THE 

654
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,459
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN HAS SAID 

655
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,628
SHE WILL VOTE NO. 

656
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,797
SHE IS A RED STATE AND SHE HAS 

657
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:33,164
DOUBLE DIGITS. 

658
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,532
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? 

659
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:40,572
>>  SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST 

660
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,307
DEMOCRATS EFFORT RELAXING. 

661
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,542
SHE IS UNDERWATER BY THE DOUBLE 

662
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,712
DIGITS AND THERE ARE A COUPLE 

663
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,913
OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO TAKE 

664
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:50,682
AWAY. 

665
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,283
ONE, OR BROKEN STRATEGISTS ARE 

666
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:53,251
PUSHING THAT SHE IS SO FAR GONE 

667
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,053
THAT THE RACE IS OVER AND SHE 

668
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,155
IS TAKING WITH DEMOCRATS IN THE 

669
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,756
FINAL DAYS HERE AND ANOTHER WAY 

670
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,426
TO LOOK AT IT IS THAT SHE IS 

671
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,395
GOING WITH HER GUT AND WHERE 

672
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,831
SHE THINKS SHE SHOULD BE AND 

673
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,000
PERHAPS TRYING TO MOTIVATE 

674
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,036
REPUBLICANS -- SORRY, SOME 

675
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,237
DEMOCRATS THAT MIGHT NOT TURN 

676
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,105
UP IN A PLACE LIKE NORTH DAKOTA.

677
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,808
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT 

678
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,576
WITH HER OUT OF THE GAME, THAT 

679
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,012
PUTS THE SPOTLIGHT RIGHT BACK 

680
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,147
ON JOE MANSION. 

681
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,281
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT 

682
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:23,682
THAT.  

683
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,917
WE DO NOT KNOW IF HE WILL CROSS 

684
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,284
THE AISLE. 

685
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:32,624
HE HAS A CLOSE RACE.  TALK TO 

686
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,258
ME ABOUT THE MATH? 

687
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,125
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING 

688
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,360
BECAUSE  MANSION AND JOE 

689
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,095
DONNELLY HAVE CROSSED THE AISLE 

690
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,198
LAST YEAR TO VOTE FOR NEIL SO 

691
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,866
EVERYONE WAS LOOKING AT THEM AS 

692
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,435
A BAROMETER FOR WHERE THE RED 

693
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,470
STATE DEMOCRATS MIGHT BE. 

694
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:55,480
WE HAVE NOW SEEN DONNELLY AND 

695
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,750
HEITKAMP SAYING NO. 

696
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,550
THEN YOU HAVE MANSION. 

697
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,120
HIS DATE LOVES TRUMP AND THERE 

698
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:10,629
IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIM. 

699
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,631
HE IS REALLY ON HIS OWN HERE. 

700
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,666
I TALKED TO A REPORT IN 

701
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,267
STRATEGISTS WHO HANGS IS 

702
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,170
MANSION DOES IN FACT VOTE FOR 

703
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,238
KAVANAUGH, HE THINKS HE CAN PUT 

704
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,140
THE RACE AWAY  BUT IF HE VOTES 

705
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,443
AGAINST IT, THERE WILL BE A LOT 

706
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,411
OF PRESSURE POINTS COMING FOR 

707
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:26,611
HIM. 

708
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:30,615
ALL EYES ON HIM AND ESPECIALLY 

709
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:35,520
IF THESE REPUBLICANS VOTE NO ON 

710
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,321
KAVANAUGH, DOES MENTION THAT 

711
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,723
WITH THEM OR CROSSOVER  AND 

712
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,891
MAKE UP THE VOTES OF THEIR 

713
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:40,258
PELICANS NEED? 

714
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,261
>> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT  LISA 

715
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:43,561
MURKOWSKI. 

716
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:49,968
TALK ABOUT THE INTERNAL POLITICS

717
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:50,301
.  

718
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,636
>> THAT IS A GOOD POINT AND THE 

719
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,504
GOVERNOR HAS COME OUT IN 

720
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,371
OPPOSITION TO KAVANAUGH . THERE 

721
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,807
ARE A LOT OF NATIVE AMERICAN 

722
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,008
RESISTANCE TO KAVANAUGH OVER 

723
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,878
HIS RULINGS  REGARDING TRIBAL 

724
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,847
RIGHTS SO THAT COULD BE AN 

725
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,848
ISSUE THAT IS PLAYING AND SHE 

726
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,849
HAS BEEN GETTING A LOT OF 

727
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,918
PRESSURE BACK HOME ON THE ISSUE 

728
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:07,952
ALONE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO 

729
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,020
CONSIDER IN THE WAY SHE HAS 

730
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,954
BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THIS. 

731
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,123
WE HAVE HEARD OF HER -- OTHER 

732
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,826
CENTERS TALK FAVORABLY BUT FOR 

733
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,996
HER, SHE HAS BEEN A WILDCARD. 

734
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,798
LISA MURKOWSKI HAS ENGAGED  THE 

735
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,901
DEBATE OVER ME TOO AND WHAT 

736
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,002
THIS MEANS IN THE LARGER 

737
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:24,268
CONTEXT. 

738
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:26,871
YOU CAN IMAGINE A SITUATION 

739
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,772
WHERE SHE DOES NOT FEEL 

740
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,507
COMPELLED TO VOTE FOR HIM. 

741
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:33,978
>> IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK  AS

742
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:34,812
JEFF FLAKE MADE THE 

743
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:36,080
ANNOUNCEMENT CALLING FOR THE 

744
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,950
FBI INVESTIGATION. 

745
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,151
WOULD YOU SAY THIS IS REALLY A 

746
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,018
GIFT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 

747
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,788
WHILE -- FOR CALLING FOR THIS 

748
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:44,889
INVESTIGATION? 

749
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,157
>> IT COULD UNIFY THEM AND HELP 

750
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:49,694
TO SUPPORT KAVANAUGH  EVEN 

751
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,896
AFTER THE ALLEGATIONS SURFACED. 

752
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,197
>> YOU COULD LOOK AT IT IN A 

753
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:56,901
WAY THAT JEFF  FLAKE PROVIDED 

754
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,271
SOME COVER BECAUSE THERE WAS 

755
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,007
SOME ANXIETY ABOUT NOMINATING 

756
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,108
KAVANAUGH  OR CONFIRMING 

757
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:04,575
KAVANAUGH WITH THESE 

758
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:05,243
ALLEGATIONS OUT THERE . 

759
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,214
REPUBLICANS AS YOU HEARD SEEMED 

760
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,317
PRETTY EMBOLDENED BY THIS 

761
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,084
REPORT BECAUSE THEY THINK 

762
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,452
ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY LIMITED IN 

763
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,789
SCOPE BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

764
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,423
THAT IS SOMETHING BEING 

765
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,023
CONTESTED, REPUBLICANS FEEL 

766
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,358
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO SAY WE 

767
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,659
DID ANOTHER BACKGROUND 

768
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,928
INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI WHICH 

769
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,265
IS INDEPENDENT HERE AND THEY 

770
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,634
DID NOT FIND THE EVIDENCE 

771
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,302
NEEDED TO CORROBORATE THIS.  

772
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:34,405
THEY FILL THIS WILL GIVE SOME 

773
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,773
MOMENTUM AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY 

774
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,242
SEEN THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE 

775
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:41,512
RALLIED AROUND THIS CAUSE. 

776
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:42,680
THIS IS SIMILAR TO HOW WE SAW 

777
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,782
DONE IN 2016 OVER THE ISSUE OF 

778
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:45,817
THE SUPREME COURT. 

779
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,953
>>  WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER 

780
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,888
MANSION WILL CROSS THE AISLE OR 

781
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,725
NOT BUT PUTTING DEMOCRATS 

782
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:54,559
ASIDE, LET'S SAY THEY DON'T 

783
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,760
HAVE ANY AT THIS POINT, HOW 

784
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,530
MANY REPUBLICANS DO THEY NEED? 

785
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,765
>> IT IS SUCH A NARROW MARGIN. 

786
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,902
REMEMBER WHEN JONES  WON THAT 

787
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:04,502
SEAT? 

788
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,840
LET ME THE MARGIN FOR CONTROL 

789
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,140
RAZOR THIN. 

790
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,609
THEY CAN ONLY LOSE ONE VOTE AND 

791
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,444
THEN MIKE PENCE COULD COME IN 

792
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,713
AND BE A TIEBREAKER. 

793
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,448
YOU CAN IMAGINE A SCENARIO IN 

794
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:27,692
WHICH MURKOWSKI VOTES NO BUT 

795
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,125
MANSION VOTES YES. 

796
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,127
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE 

797
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:29,761
CONFERENCE TOGETHER AND WHY 

798
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,262
THERE IS SO MUCH CONCERN. 

799
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:31,996
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THE 

800
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,465
SENATORS  HAVE THIS BIG 

801
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,800
DRAMATIC ROLLOUT, WHY CAN'T 

802
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:42,540
THEY TELL US ABOUT THIS? 

803
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,574
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. 

804
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:44,776
NO ONE WANTS TO BE A DECIDING 

805
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,810
VOTE ON ANYTHING  AND 

806
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,845
ESPECIALLY SOMETHING THAT IS 

807
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,813
GIVING SUCH A REACTION ON ALL 

808
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:55,086
SIDES TO THIS NOMINATION. 

809
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,320
IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT, YOU DO 

810
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,321
NOT WANT TO BE THE DECIDING 

811
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,557
VOTE FOR OR AGAINST HIM. 

812
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,126
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE REMOVED 

813
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:06,898
THAT ELEMENT BUT THE OTHER 

814
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:07,932
THING IS THAT IT DOES ALLOW 

815
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,467
REPUBLICANS TO SAY WE TOOK A 

816
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,403
WEEK AND NOW WE ARE GOING INTO 

817
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,471
FRIDAY AND WE TOOK SEVERAL DAYS 

818
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,373
TO VET THIS OUT AGAIN AND IT 

819
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,476
DID NOT COME BACK WITH ANYTHING 

820
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,510
SO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE 

821
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,445
SOMETHING TO STAND ON. 

822
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,781
DEMOCRATS FEEL THAT THIS WILL 

823
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:24,749
RALLY THE TROOPS AND THERE IS 

824
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,384
THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH HIGHER 

825
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,054
THAT ENTHUSIASM CAN GO. THEY 

826
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,891
THINK THEY HAVE AN ARGUMENT TO 

827
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,093
MAKE WHICH IS THAT THE WHITE 

828
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,627
HOUSE IS IN CONTROL OF THE BEST 

829
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:39,797
PATIENT AND THEY ORDERED THE 

830
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:40,832
FBI TO TALK TO CERTAIN PEOPLE 

831
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,866
AND THEY THINK THEY COULD HAVE 

832
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:45,770
DONE A BETTER JOB. 

833
00:31:45,770 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THANK YOU FOR BREAK
