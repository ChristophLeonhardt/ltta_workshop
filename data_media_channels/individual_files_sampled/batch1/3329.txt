well the great thing about cleaning and again I talked about this in my book is understanding the products the tools and the techniques that you need to do an effective clean so products you don't have to go right to the top and use the most harsh product to do a cleaning you can oftentimes accomplish a lot of work with a pretty gentle product whether it's one that you're purchasing or one that you're making on your own and half of cleaning comes down to tools so understanding exactly what kind of cleaning tools do I need to use because you know you walk down the aisle the cleaning aisle in a big-box store and you're like what's this what's this do I need that you know so once you have an understanding of the products and the tools you can then choose the right thing for the job and then apply the appropriate technique that's what I call the P TTS products tools and techniques and you can get the job done even a hard one toothbrush is great at cleaning toothbrush they're very inexpensive and frankly a great way to upcycle you can clean your toothbrush when you're finished using it for your mouth and you want to move on to cleaning by just mixing up a solution of equal parts hydrogen peroxide and water and soaking it for 30 minutes then it's good to go for cleaning this soap is another one of my favorites I tell you I've probably cleaned like 50 60 percent of my house with some solution including dish soap I also of course use it in the kitchen and baking soda is like I have a love affair with baking soda so yeah baking soda is a wonderful cleaning triple threaded deodorizes it has mild abrasion and it also helps to brighten and whiten great one of the most basic recipes that I love and they whip up I mean I don't know we probably go through a bottle of it once a week I would say it's a cup of water 1/2 cup of rubbing alcohol 10 drops of essential oil and it's my house so obviously I have a whole selection of essential oils in my kitchen I love using thyme and a little squirt of dish soap about half a teaspoon and there's your all-purpose cleaner right there that's a great one
