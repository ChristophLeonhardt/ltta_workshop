>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> GOOD DAY WE'RE COMING ON THE 
AIR.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT TO ENTER 
THE DIPLOMATIC ROOM OF THE WHITE
HOUSE AND ANNOUNCE HEAL FORMALLY
ANNOUNCE JERUSALEM AS THE 
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND ULTIMATELY
MOVE THE EMBASSY THERE.
IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL DECISION 
FROM PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THE 
STATUS SHOULD BE HANDLED IN 
PEACE TALKS.
MANY U.S. PRESIDENTS PROMISED TO
MAKE THIS MOVE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP THE FIRST TO 
FOLLOW THROUGH.
I WANT TO BRING IN IS HE CECILIA
VEGA. 
>> I'M TOLD BY AIDES HE WANTED 
TO DO THIS SOONER THAN TODAY.
HE LEARNED YOU CAN'T SNAP YOUR 
FINGER AND MOVE AN EMBASSY.
HE'S BEEN UNDER I AM MENS 
PRESSURE TO MAKE THIS MOVE.
IF THE EMBASSY DOESN'T OPEN ANY 
TIME SOON -- IT'S EXPECTED TO 
TAKE YEARS.
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO 
PAINT THIS AS A CAMPAIGN PROMISE
FULFILLED PERHAPS AT THE EXPENSE
OF THE PEACE PROCESS. 
>> I WANT TO BRING IN MARTHA 
RADDATZ.
YOU'VE SEEN OUR ALLIES IN EUROPE
CONDEMN THIS MOVE.
THEY SAY IT'S GOING TO BE 
DANGEROUS AND COMPLICATE THE 
PEACE PROCESS. 
>> IT CERTAINLY WILL, GEORGE.
WHATEVER PEACE PROCESS THERE IS,
WHATEVER PEACE NISH TRIF THERE 
IS -- OF COURSE JARED KUSHNER 
HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS.
I THINK IT'S A SIGNAL THINGS 
HAVING BEEN GOING WELL.
I'LL TOSS IT BACK TO YOU GEORGE.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ENTERING WITH
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. 
>> THANK YOU.
WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE, I 
PROMISED TO LOOK AT THE WORLD'S 
CHALLENGES WITH OPEN EYES AND 
VERY FRESH THINKING.
WE CANNOT SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS BY 
MAKING THE SAME FAILED 
ASSUMPTIONS AND REPEATING THE 
SAME FAILED STRATEGIES OF THE 
PAST.
OLD CHALLENGES DEMAND NEW 
APPROACHES.
MY ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY MARKS THE 
BEGINNING OF A NEW APPROACH TO 
CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE 
PALESTINIANS.
IN 1995 CONGRESS ADOPTED THE 
JERUSALEM EMBASSY ACT URGING THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RELOCATE 
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO 
JERUSALEM AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT 
THAT CITY AND SO IMPORTANTLY IS 
ISRAEL'S CAPITAL.
THIS ACT PASSED CONGRESS BY AN 
OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN MAJORITY
AND WAS REAFFIRMED BY UNANIMOUS 
VOTE OF THE SENATOR, ONLY SIX 
MONTHS AGO.
YET FOR OVER 20 YEARS EVERY 
PREVIOUS AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS 
EXERCISED THE LAWS WAIVER 
REFUSING TO MOVE THE U.S. 
EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM OR TO 
RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS ISRAEL'S 
CAPITAL CITY.
PRESIDENTS ISSUED THESE WAIVERS 
UNDER THE BELIEF THAT DELAYING 
THE RECOGNITION OF JERUSALEM 
WOULD ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF 
PEACE.
SOME SAY THEY LACKED COURAGE, 
BUT THEY MADE THEIR BEST 
JUDGMENT BASED ON FACTS AS THEY 
UNDERSTOOD THEM AT THE TIME.
NEVERTHELESS THE RECORD IS IN.
AFTER MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF 
WAIVERS WE ARE NO CLOSER TO A 
LASTING PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS.
IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO ASSUME 
REPEATING THE EXACT SAME FORMULA
WOULD NOW PRODUCE A DIFFERENT OR
BETTER RESULT.
THEREFORE I HAVE DETERMINED THAT
IT IS TIME TO OFFICIALLY 
RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE 
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.
WHILE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS HAVE 
MADE THIS A MAJOR CAMPAIGN 
PROMISE, THEY FAILED TO DELIVER.
TODAY I AM DELIVERING.
I'VE JUDGED THIS COURSE OF 
ACTION TO BE IN THE BEST 
INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND THE PURSUIT OF PEACE BETWEEN
ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS.
THIS IS A LONG OVERDUE STEP TO 
ADVANCE THE PEACE PROCESS AND TO
WORK TOWARDS A LASTING 
AGREEMENT.
ISRAEL IS A SOVEREIGN NATION 
WITH THE RIGHT LIKE EVERY OTHER 
SOVEREIGN NATION TO DETERMINE 
ITS OWN CAPITAL.
ACKNOWLEDGING THIS AS A FACT IS 
A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR 
ACHIEVING PEACE.
IT WAS 70 YEARS AGO THAT THE 
UNITED STATES UNDER PRESIDENT 
TRUEMAN RECOGNIZED THE STATE OF 
ISRAEL.
EVER SINCE THAT ISRAEL HAS MADE 
ITS CAPITAL IN THE CITY OF 
JERUSALEM.
THE CAPITAL THE JEWISH PEOPLE 
ESTABLISHED IN ANCIENT TIMES.
TODAY IT IS THE SEAT OF THE 
MODERN ISRAELRY GOVERNMENT.
IT'S THE HOME OF THE ISRAELRY 
PARLIAMENT AS WELL AS THE 
ISRAELRY SUPREME COURT.
IT'S THE LOCATION OF THE 
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE OF THE PRIME 
MEN AND THE PRESIDENT.
IT IS THE HEAD QUARTERS OF MANY 
GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES.
FOR DECADES VISITING AMERICAN 
PRESIDENTS, SECRETARIES OF STATE
AND MILITARY LEADERS HAVE MET 
THEIR ISRAELI COUNTER PARTS IN 
JERUSALEM AS I DID ON MY TRIP TO
ISRAEL EARLIER THIS YEAR.
JERUSALEM IS NOT JUST THE HEART 
OF THREE GREAT RELIGIONS.
IT'S NOW ALSO THE HEART OF ONE 
OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
DEMOCRACIES IN THE WORLD.
OVER THE PAST SEVEN DECADES THE 
ISRAELI PEOPLE HAVE BUILT A 
COUNTRY WHERE JEWS, MUSLIMS AND 
CHRISTIANS CAN WORSHIP ACCORDING
TO THEIR CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS.
JERUSALEM IS TODAY AND MUST 
REMAIN A PLACE WHERE JEWS PRAY 
AT THE WESTERN WALL.
WHERE CHRISTIANS WALK THE 
STATIONS OF THE CROSS AND WHERE 
MUSLIMS WORSHIP AT THEIR MOSQUE.
HOWEVER THROUGH ALL OF THESE 
YEARS PRESIDENTS REPRESENTING 
THE UNITED STATES HAVE DID HE 
CLI 
DECLINED TO OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE
JERUSALEM AS ISRAEL'S CAPITAL.
IN FACT, WE HAVE DECLINED TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY ISRAELI CAPITAL 
AT ALL.
TODAY WE FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE
OBVIOUS, THAT JERUSALEM IS 
ISRAEL'S CAPITAL.
THIS IS NOTHING MORE OR LESS 
THAN A RECOGNITION OF REALITY.
IT IS ALSO THE RIGHT THING TO 
DO.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE 
DONE.
THAT IS WHY CONSISTENT WITH THE 
JERUSALEM EMBASSY ACT I AM ALSO 
DIRECTING THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
TO BEGIN PREPARATION TO MOVE THE
AMERICAN EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV 
TO JERUSALEM.
THIS WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE 
PROCESS OF HIRING ARCHITECTS, 
ENGINEERS AND PLANNERS SO THAT A
NEW EMBASSY, WHEN COMPLETED, 
WILL BE A MAGNIFICENT TRIBUTE TO
PEACE. 
>> IN MAKING THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT 
VERY CLEAR.
THIS DECISION IS NOT INTENDED IN
ANY WAY TO REFLECT A DEPARTURE 
FROM OUR STRONG COMMITMENT TO 
FACILITATE A LASTING PEACE 
AGREEMENT.
WE WANT AN AGREEMENT THAT IS A 
GREAT DEAL FOR THE ISRAELIS AND 
A GREAT DEAL FOR THE 
PALESTINIANS.
WE ARE NOT TAKING A POSITION OF 
ANY FINAL STATUS ISSUES, 
INCLUDING THE SPECIFIC 
BOUNDARIES OF THE ISRAELI 
SOVEREIGNTY IN JERUSALEM OR THE 
RESOLUTION OF CONTESTED BORDERS.
THOSE QUESTIONS ARE UP TO THE 
PARTIES INVOLVED.
THE UNITED STATES REMAINS DEEPLY
COMMITTED TO HELPING FACILITATE 
A PEACE AGREEMENT THAT IS 
ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES.
I INTEND TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY 
POWER TO HELP FORGE SUCH AN 
AGREEMENT.
WITHOUT QUESTION JERUSALEM IS 
ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE ISSUES
IN THOSE TALKS.
THE UNITED STATES WOULD SUPPORT 
A TWO-STATE SOLUTION IF AGREED 
TO BY BOTH SIDES.
IN THE MEANTIME I CALL ON ALL 
PARTIES TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS 
QUO AS JERUSALEM'S HOLY SITES 
INCLUDING THE TEMPLE MOUNT.
ABOVE ALL OUR GREATEST HOPE IS 
FOR PEACE.
THE UNIVERSAL YEARNING IN EVERY 
HUMAN SOUL.
WITH TODAY'S ACTION, I REAFFIRM 
MY ADMINISTRATION'S 
LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO A 
FUTURE OF PEACE AND SECURITY FOR
THE REGION.
THERE WILL OF COURSE BE 
DISAGREEMENT AND DI SENT 
REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
WE'RE CONFIDENT AS WE WORK 
THROUGH THESE DISAGREEMENTS 
WE'LL ARRIVE AT A PEACE AND A 
PLACE FAR GREATER IN 
UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.
THIS SACRED CITY SHOULD CALL 
FORTH THE BEST IN HUMANITY, 
LIFTING OUR SIGHTS TO WHAT IS 
POSSIBLE, NOT PULLING US BACK 
AND DOWN TO THE OLD FIGHTS THAT 
HAVE BECOME SO TOTALLY 
PREDICTABLE.
PEACE IS NEVER BEYOND THE GRASP 
OF THOSE WILLING TO REACH IT.
SO TODAY WE CALL FOR CALM, FOR 
MODERATION AND FOR THE VOICES OF
TOLERANCE TO PREVAIL OVER THE 
PURVEY ORS OF HATE.
OUR CHILDREN SHOULD INHERIT OUR 
LOVE, NOT OUR CONFLICTS.
I REPEAT THE MESSAGE I DELIVERED
AT THE HISTORIC AND 
EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT IN SAUDI 
ARABIA EARLIER THIS YEAR.
ITS PEOPLE ARE BRILLIANT PROUD 
ANDY VERSE, VIBRANT AND STRONG.
THE INCREDIBLE FUTURE AWAITING 
THIS REGION IS HELD AT BAY BY 
BLOOD SHED, IGNORANCE AND 
TERROR.
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WILL 
TRAVEL TO THE REGION TO REPEAT 
OUR COMMITMENT TO DEFEAT THE 
RADICALISM THAT DASHES THE HOPES
AND DREAMS OF FUTURE 
GENERATIONS.
IT IS TIME FOR THE MANY WHO 
DESIRE PEACE TO EXPEL THE 
EXTREMISTS FROM THEIR MIDSTS.
IT IS TIME FOR ALL SIF LIEZED 
NATIONS AND PEOPLE TO RESPOND TO
DISAGREEMENT WITH REASONABLE 
DEBATE, NOT VIOLENCE.
IT IS TIME FOR YOUNG AND 
MODERATE VOICES ALL ACROSS THE 
MIDDLE EAST TO CLAIM FOR 
THEMSELVES A BRIGHT AND 
BEAUTIFUL FUTURE.
TODAY LET US REDEDICATE 
OURSELVES TO A PATH OF MUTUAL 
UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT.
LET US RETHINK OLD ASSUMPTIONS 
AND OPEN OUR HEARTS AND MINDS TO
POSSIBLE AND POSSIBILITIES.
FINALLY I ASK THE LEADERS OF THE
REGION, POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS,
ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN, JEWISH,
CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM TO JOIN US 
IN THE NOBLE QUEST FOR LASTING 
PEACE.
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU.
GOD BLESS ISRAEL.
GOD BLESS THE PALESTINIANS AND 
GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES.
THANK YOU HAVE MUCH. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP CLOSING THE 
REMARKS ASKING FOR PEACE AND 
CALM.
AFTER PLACING HIM IN THE 
TRADITION OF HARRY TRUEMAN THE 
FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO 
RECOGNIZE ISRAEL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP BECOMING THE 
FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO 
RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM THE CAPITAL 
OF ISRAEL.
PUTTING HIS SIGNATURES ON THE 
PAGINGS.
HE SAYS AFTER PLANNING HE'LL 
MOVE THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY 
FROM TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYS THIS IS 
A RECOGNITION OF REALITY.
JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITAL OF 
ISRAEL.
HE'S SAYING IT'S ALSO THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO.
WHERE IT MIGHT NOT BE A 
RECOGNITION OF REALITY IS HIS 
POINT THIS DOES NOT SIGNAL A 
DEPARTURE FRFT PEACE PROCESS. 
>> THAT'S NOT HOW OUR ALLIES IN 
THE ARAB WORLD SEE IT. 
>> AND ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS 
THEIR EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM.
NOW THE UNITED STATES WILL IF 
THIS CONTINUES.
ASK YOURSELF WHY.
THE REASON IS BECAUSE EVERY 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS 
RECOGNIZED HOW DANGEROUS, HOW 
INTENTIONALLY EMOTIONAL, HOW 
PROFOUND AN ISSUE THIS IS.
SACRED GROUND FOR THREE OF THE 
WORLD'S MAJOR RELIGIONS.
NOT ONLY DOES THIS PUT THE 
UNITED STATES OUT OF STEP WITH 
ARAB ALLIES AND EUROPEAN ALLIES 
IT PUTS US OUT OF STEP WITH 
LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD.
IT NULL FIES THE POSSIBILITY OF 
NEGOTIATION ON THIS PROCESS.
HE SAYS THAT HE'S STILL OPEN TO 
A TWO-STATE SOLUTION.
PALESTINIANS WHO ALSO BELIEVE 
THAT JERUSALEM IS THEIR CAPITAL 
NOW FEEL THAT CONVERSATION HAS 
BEEN CLOSED.
THE UNITED STATES REALLY GOT 
NOTHING FORGIVING AWAY THIS 
CONCESSION IN THESE 
NEGOTIATIONS.
IT'S A UNILATERAL STEP OUT OF 
STEP WITH COUNTRIES AROUND THE 
WORLD. 
>> IT WAS A FULL THROATED 
ARTICULATION OF THE ISRAELI 
POSITION.
I WANT TO BRING IN JON KARL.
THERE'S A LITTLE AN LOG TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S APPROACH TO DOMESTIC
POLITICS. 
>> STRONG SUPPORTER OF ISRAEL, 
STRONG SUPPORTER OF BENJAMIN 
NETANYAHU. 
>> FOCUSING ON KEEPING WHAT WAS 
A CORE CAMPAIGN PROMISE.
HE PROMISED LIKE MANY REPUBLICAN
CANADA DATDS IN THE PAST HE 
PROMISED HE WOULD RECOGNIZE 
JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL.
HE PROMISED HE WOULD MOVE THE 
U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.
HE DID HOLD BACK A LITTLE BIT.
HE SAID HE'LL BEGIN THE PROCESS 
OF STUDYING AN MOVING TOWARDS 
MOVING THE EMBASSY.
IF HE WANTED TO GO FURTHER HE 
COULD HAVE.
THERE IS A U.S. KONS LATE IN 
JERUSALEM.
THAT COULD BE IMMEDIATELY CHRIS 
EVENED AS THE EMBASSY.
HE STOPPED SHORT OF THAT.
THERE IS STILL NEGOTIATION ON 
THIS POINT BECAUSE THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS NOT RULING OUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A PALESTINIAN 
STATE HAVING ITS CAPITAL IN 
JERUSALEM AS WELL, HAVING ITS 
CAPITAL IN EAST JERUSALEM.
IT'S NOT AS FAR AS HE COULD HAVE
GONE.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO SAY
THEY'RE LEAFING OPEN THE PEACE 
PROCESS. 
>> THEY'RE SAYING IT COULD TAKE 
YEARS TO MOVE THE EMBASSY.
LET ME BRING BACK MARTHA 
RADDATZ.
HE SAID OLD CHALLENGES NEED NEW 
APPROACHES.
WHAT WE DIDN'T HEAR IS ANY 
'NUANCE YAGS WHAT THAT APPROACH 
MIGHT LOOK LIKE. 
>> EXACTLY GEORGE.
BASICALLY HE LEFT IT AS IF IT'S 
THE ONLY REASON WE DIDN'T HAVE A
PEACE AGREEMENT BEFORE BY 
DECLARING JERUSALEM THE CAPITAL.
ALSO HAVE TO SAY IT'S A BIG 
WORLD OUT THERE.
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT DOMESTIC 
POLITICS.
WE'RE AT A PLACE IN THE WORLD 
WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY 
CONFLICTS STILL ONGOING.
LOOK AT IRAQ.
WE'RE TRYING TO STABILIZE IRAQ.
LOOK AT NORTH KOREA.
A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF 
ALLIES, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE 
ARAB WORLD ARE SAYING WHY NOW?
WHY THROW FLAMES. 
>> WE WANT TO GO TO JAMES 
LONGMAN IN THE REGION.
JAMES, THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR 
CALM IN THAT STATEMENT AS WELL.
THIS IS A TENSE REGION NOW. 
>> GEORGE, IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
WHAT PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING FOR 
THE CLARITY T. DONALD TRUMP MADE
NO MENTION OF THE WORDS EAST OR 
WEST.
HE SAID ISRAEL SHOULD HAVE A 
CAPITAL CITY AND THAT SHOULD BE 
JERUSALEM.
PALESTINIANS WILL BE LOOKING FOR
CLARITY.
MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY 
BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP WOULD MAKE 
THIS SORT OF STATEMENT.
THERE WAS SOME DISBELIEF HERE.
AS THE REALIZATION STARTS TO 
SINK IN -- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE 
THE SYMBOLISM.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THIS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME, THE UNITED 
STATES SAYING SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS, THAT KIND OF SYMBOLISM TO 
THE EAST COULD MEAN TROUBLE.
FOR THE MOMENT PALESTINIANS 
TAKING IT IN.
I THINK IT COULD MEAN TROUBLE AS
THE WEEK GOES ON. 
>> LET ME GO BACK TO IS HE 
CECILIA VEGA.
JARED KUSHNER HAS BEEN THE POINT
PERSON ON THIS, BUT HE JUST SAID
HE WAS SENDING THE VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> YES.
VERY PROM DANTLY DISPLAYED 
BEHIND PRESIDENT TRUMP.
PERHAPS A NOD TO THE 
EVANGELICALS.
HE HAS FACED A LOT OF PRESSURE 
FROM PRO ISRAEL GROUPS 
PARTICULARING SHELDON, A HUGE 
DONOR.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT WAS 
PART OF THE PRESSURE THIS 
PRESIDENT FACED.
HE HAS TO SIGN THE WAIVER AGAIN.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO SIGN IT 
WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE HE WASN'T 
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE 
CAMPAIGN PROMISE.
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN GEORGE 
GOING FORWARD WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
WITH THIS.
THERE ARE NO PLANS TO BUILD THE 
EMBASSY.
WE'LL SEE WHETHER IT HAPPENS 
UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP TENURE OR 
SOMEONE ELSE. 
>> DRAMATIC MOVE FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP.
HE'S ANNOUNCING BECOMING THE 
FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT AS 
FORMERLY RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM 
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.
