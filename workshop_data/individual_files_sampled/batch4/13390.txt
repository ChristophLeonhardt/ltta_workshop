peeled net neutrality and everybody literally died and then then he reformed our tax code he lowered people's taxes lowered the corporate rate I don't know how many people died in that but now he's gone too far Donald Trump is now criticizing murderous psychopath gangsters it's too far here are Donald Trump's comments yeah an ms-13 gang member I know about if they don't we just the best certain threshold I cannot tell ice about them we have people coming into the country of trying to come in we're stopping a lot of them but we're taking people out of the country you wouldn't believe how bad these people are these aren't people these are animals and we're taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that's never happened before and because of the weak laws they come in fast we get them we release them we get them again we bring them out it's crazy the mainstream media are furious that Donald Trump would say such a thing that violent terrible criminals are animals so we'll get to the headlines in a second we'll get to the mainstream media and the Democrat response in a second first just a little bit of context here's a quick rundown of some of ms-13 s gang crimes from just this year and last year last November Donald Trump's administration arrested 200 members of this gang in America this year we've arrested a hundred we don't know how many gang members are in this country it's a violent gang primarily from El Salvador ms-13 here's a quick rundown let's just look at this week on Tuesday a man's body was discovered in a shallow grave dug in a park in Washington DC ms-13 gang members dug that grave before they stabbed the man more than 100 times cut off his head and ripped out his heart and then so Donald Trump called those guys animals that mainstream media they're furious they're furious here are some other ms-13 gang crimes just for last year ms-13 affiliate Venis Romero tortured stabbed and killed a fifteen year old girl for dating her boyfriend in January of last year another ms-13 gang member murdered 15 year old de Morris Alexandra raised Rivas and by the way just notice something here a lot of these victims are Hispanic a lot of these victims actually are immigrants from the same places that this gang comes from so they say oh it's a racist you're talking about these these animals accusing these people of the crimes that they have obviously committed a lot of the victims are from the same areas they're from the same immigrant groups another another crime Miguel Alvarez Flores in Diego Hernandez Rivera kidnapped sexually tortured and murdered a teenage girl I was last February 3 ms-13 gang members stabbed and mutilated 17 year-old Raymond wood before running him over with their car cutting off his hands and leaving him for dead that was in March also in March Hector Lazo and Pedro Rivera shot 37 year old Nelson Rodriguez in the back of the head he was just walking down the street in April to document 'add ms-13 gang members shot an 11-year old girl in two teenage boys in Houston documented meaning we knew who they were we knew they were here illegally we knew that they were members of this gang but we couldn't do anything hard to do anything about that we wouldn't want people to think that we think of them as animals we that would would that would be racist for some reason or whatever the mainstream media says in April of last year ms-13 gangsters wielding machetes mutilated and murdered four victims between 16 and 20 around the same time as they murdered seven others in the same neighborhoods Alexi signs murdered three Long Island high school students last year ms-13 gang member he attacked two young girls at the same time when they were walking through their suburban neighborhood a three ms-13 gangsters were arrested last May after they slashed a 19 year old with a machete and shot him point-blank ms-13 gang member Carlos Gonzales murdered his girlfriend maritza Lopez last year that guy is still at large I could go I could go on for the whole rest of this show with these peoples crimes they are face tattooed demons from hell only God can judge people but the Donald Trump administration can arrange the meeting there's nothing wrong with that and actually what in the more you read about these crimes you realize that what Donald Trump said is not true these people are not animals they are much much worse than animals because animals aren't morally culpable for what they do when the tiger eats the little animal in the jungle that it's not that like the tiger is sinning it's not like the tiger has committed some immoral act it's just in the tigers nature to eat other animals but when human beings who have a moral conscience when they mutilate people kill teenage girls maim cut off body parts cut off heads when they do that they are committing evil they are they are pervaded by evil and when they should know better when they do know better but they choose to do evil things it's much worse than animals we should all be able to agree that these guys are pretty bad right I think that I think you know I know we're in a time of political disagreement political rancor I think we can all agree that face tattooed gangsters who decapitate little teenage girls probably those guys are not good people right that's what you would think how did the Democrats and the mainstream media react they defended the psychopath gangsters this is so some of some of the headlines we have here Trump lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a White House meeting calling those trying to breach the country's borders animals who saw this in the New York Times but he wasn't lashing out at undocumented immigrant lashing out at illegal aliens he was lashing out at violent criminals and this actually gets to an incredible point of the mainstream media and the Democrat party's bigotry which is that they're conflating violent Psychopaths gangsters with all illegal aliens Donald Trump didn't do that he made a he was very specific he said these people are animals these people are sick monsters and we got to get them out and the mainstream media said you're calling all illegal aliens all immigrants animals all immigrants are less than human I said what are you talking about I never said that the illegal aliens are all psychopath criminals you said that it goes on Jennifer Rubin said she writes for The Washington Post she pretends to be a Republican she's one of the biggest Democrat chills in the entire country she tweeted quote this is disgusting and Trump's evangelical sycophants will applaud his utter dehumanization of men women and children I don't know how many little girls are members of ms-13 I suspect zero none of them are but this actress this really lowers my estimation of Jennifer Rubin I always thought she was just one of those fake Republicans that the mainstream media hires so that they can pretend that they have a Republican opinion and they just use that person constantly to criticize Republicans but here she's just flat-out lying I don't think she's stupid enough to actually think that Donald Trump is is saying something that he obviously didn't say so here we just have a flat outlier in Jennifer Rubin it's really pathetic from Andrea Mitchell at NBC but by the way just a point on Andrea Mitchell it took me approximately twenty four years of my life on this earth to realize that Andrea Mitchell and Mika Brzezinski are not the same person did you know that that they're not the same person it's just that maybe other people realize it this was news to me so she tweets that quote a tough takedown by the California Governor after real Donald Trump calls people trying to get into the country animals not people again he didn't call people trying to get it well he called some people trying to get into the country animals not people like they're vicious gangsters and this gets to it an important point of illegal immigration some of the people trying to get into our country are vicious gangster criminals who should not be allowed in she's she's actually unwittingly tried to she's unwittingly made our point right which is that it's not all just really nice polite workers coming in who are the the people entering our country some of them are criminals some are those bad people that Trump talked about when he launched his campaign from Bengie Sorrell and a political reporter at NBC quote one of trumps most consistent rhetorical moves is comparing large classes of human beings to animals a political tactic with a long and deadly history I think he's making the argument amad Hitler room at this point you know any anybody who disagrees with me is Hitler that's what he's saying about Trump Chris Christian feat Farias from New York Magazine never ever forget this fact Donald Trump reserves the word animals only for brown people so what you're saying buddy is that all brown people are criminals that's what you're saying you're saying that they're animals and they're criminals but that's not what Donald Trump is saying he's saying some people are criminals and those people are animals you're conflating race and and crime it's not the Republicans doing it it's not Donald Trump doing it it's a you mainstream media and drownded all that Tyler Hansen from the d-trip the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee he sends out these pictures of these little the current kids these like sweet little kids and crying parents says Trump we're taking people out of the country you wouldn't believe how bad these people are these aren't people these are animals so that's just a lie right he's not talking about those people he's talking about gangsters the mainstream media the Democrats they're now defending ms-13 the the strategy that they have undertaken is to oppose anything that Trump does the trouble for them is the Trump is doing successful and popular things on the economy on foreign affairs on domestic affairs on immigration so they're opposing that but that leads them into these absurd positions like defending ms-13 they're not they say okay Trump likes kicking out gangsters so so we need to bring them into the country that then will just do the opposite keep it up guys keep it up Democrats good work yeah I can't wait for November okay let's bring on our guest Lord Conrad Black Conrad Black is a member of the British House of Lords he's a financier a newspaper tycoon historian biographer excellent columnist I suggest you read his writings he has a new book out I really really like this book I highly recommend Donald J Trump a president like no other this book has just come out this week you have to read it Lorde black thank you for being here thank you for having me Michael and I want to say I agreed with everything you've said in the part that I've seen especially that beastly woman Jennifer Rubin it's high time she was unmasked it is it is so frustrating because I so many times with these Republicans who all they ever do is try to get Democrats to like them I say okay you're opportunistic that's fine but this is outright lies and there are a lot of lies about a president Donald Trump you have written the best coverage of Donald Trump that I have read this book is so so good and it gives a perspective that people are just not getting in the media I want to delve into that some of the lies some of the distortions that we have let's begin with a sort of obvious one a lot of people are telling us here that Donald Trump is secretly an idiot he's just a dummy he doesn't know anything and he's just made it to the highest points of real estate and casinos and politics and television just by luck or by whatever what is it you you write about how Donald Trump has a real genius for real estate how did he manage to make it to the top of that industry and every other well in the case of real estate he he had an absolutely tireless devotion as he has said at times to putting the deal together and it means going to a bankrupt organization persuading claimants and suitors to hand over for some sort of consideration but not not tangible and not upfront their claims in respect real estate assets and then and then shopping this around through proper financial circles to get building loans and municipal approvals and approval of creditors and it is it is an unbelievably exacting process but his first big deal the old Commodore hotel between the Chrysler Building in Grand Central Station in New York that's what he did and he didn't have anything he said I have you're a signed contract and it one of his many held press conferences every days and and he was just very young men and and he did have a sign counter it was signed by him but not by the other party even say that it always puts you into the position of being a bit of a huckster and and a peddler and a slightly shabby middleman but but if you stay at it hard enough and there is ingenious at it as he was well it couldn't have % you make a fortune and and that's what he did and now he got carried away and he ended up for a time with a negative net worth but he convened the bankers himself and he ain't knew the last thing in the world they wanted to do was call the loans that have to acknowledge the assets where we're going to be severely devalued and the last thing in the world a banker once said he was trying to run a real estate business and all he had to do was say look just sit tight I'll give you all the pledge you only collateral I can and this is my plan of action to work my way out of this and that's what happened and what you going back to what you said about this allegation against him of being essentially deep down he shower the fact is as I pointed out towards the end of the book and thank you for your kind words about it he achieved more objectively speaking he achieved more before he was inaugurated president than any previous holder of that office except Washington Jefferson Madison grant and Eisenhower I'm not denigrating the others most of the others had serious careers some of them very substantial like Woodrow Wilson at Princeton University and so forth but not like that not where you make billions of dollars you've you've decided to become a television performer from day one and for 15 years without one single interruption you're pulling over 25 million viewers top slot every week for 15 years except two nights opposite American Idol and I never watched that kind of television I'm not what I've done as programs but that's not the point he was a great success and and to take over the Republican Party either party but the only other person who did this was Wendell Willkie where you have never sought or held a public office elected or non elected or a military command and and you and you take over the party Wilkie did it for the great honor of running it against Franklin Delano Roosevelt it was invincible nobody could ever defeat and and and Donald Trump did it and and then and then he actually won this election it was an astonishing feat and how anyone I mean I understand why people don't like them I understand why they feel threatened by I understand how they find him distasteful all about I understood but to say that he is not an accomplished and capable man is an outrage and I love that the book is actually rather even-handed there it's there's no hiding I I think you admire Donald Trump I admire Donald Trump but the account is well the the fact of the biography is that it is honest about hit some of his flaws as you mentioned the hucksterism you're you're quite open about that even some of his business failings some of his untruths that he's told along the way you what university was I mean it in one sense it's magnificent if you've been actually in that PT Burnham wave ever go bankrupt on you know whose edge rating the intelligence of the public but I mean you it's it's outrageous and it's but it's a music but it is egregious it is I've actually only been referring to Wharton School in the University of Pennsylvania as Trump University these days because I know it bothers the students there but but you write early on in the book you say it is also Trump's nature honed by the rough and tumble of his career including observing his father's business to believe that no competitive activity beyond the playing field if that is quite as pristine as represented he is not so much a cynic as a methodological agnostic not a liar as much as a disbeliever in absolute secular truths and there is a lot in that sentence what do you mean by it and what is Donald Trump's relationship to the truth just and I'll take the last part first if I may you have to examine his relationship to the truth in looking upon him as we are or as a public figure and indeed as the holder of the great office of president of the u.s. you have to examine it I think at two levels at one level he has the habits of his career and engages in what he calls truthful hyperbole now how truthful it is sometimes has opened a legitimate question although often it's partly truthful and he and he believes in exaggerating in a manner that is somewhat self-serving and he's only slowly I think but definitely gradually recognizing that if he scales that back he'll he'll gain by doing so that he's got he's got people watching and listening so carefully many of them in hostile to him that he's giving ammunition to his enemies if he doesn't if he doesn't reel it back a bit but on the other level in terms of addressing the country promising the country what he will do if they elevate into this supreme office it must be said that in doing precisely what he promised to do his record is absolutely historically outstanding and not surpassed by anyone else I mean he said he would pull out of the Paris Accord it shocked people and he did it but he did it he was right to do it it's a ridiculous of court he said he'd move the embassy in Israel he did it and he was right to do it he said he walked out of the Iran agreement and even highly serious foreign policy people said well it's no point during that we've already given them the money was a terrible agreement but why walk out now but he's walking out in order to Korean eyes the issue and really put the heat on Iran to make a permanent renunciation of nuclear weapons he's absolutely right he said he would do it it was controversial and in the case of course of the Israeli embassy that has been promised by several of his predecessors who then didn't do anything he said he would eliminate oil imports he's doing it every president since Eisenhower said that and some of them were very good presidents but they didn't do that he's doing so at that level he absolutely is truthful and well yeah that's right yeah I think you you have you examine it on two planes one is the traditional Donald Trump who made who made his way in in various entertainment related or or highly financially speculative occupations where a liberality with the truth was customary and profitable and was not looked upon as obscenely unethical because it was customary and on the other hand as Donald Trump the relatively new Donald Trump as that as a leader of the nation and particularly the head of a vast faction of voters adequate in their size to put him in the White House he is absolutely truthful so it depends which angle you take the subject and I think when his critics say that he's a liar because that's all they say no he's a liar he's this first of all it coming from holders of the highest offices of national security who lied repeatedly under oath and should be and soon will be in front of the grand jury which in your country means they're out to jail that's right that's that's absolutely right you have people on television and not not even just the Susan Rice's of the world who lied to us not even just the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton but even up to Barack Obama lied right to our face and we can we can check so many of those lies the president would but I don't believe he lied under oath in fairness all president Russell I even mr. Lincoln engaged in truthful hyperbole at times but but yeah I'm talking about lying under oath which is a crime present anyway yeah there's not the slightest that that Hillary Clinton most of that entourage of hers James clapper John Brennan James Comey Andrew McCabe they all did that and and it is a bit rich taking it from the Democrats complaining about mr. Trump being a liar when they are all basically just waiting for indictment right that's right they're just sitting there checking their iPhones you know so if it's not today and the distinction that they they seem not to make is the difference between a lie and unsubtle T so if Trump in this extreme political way is able to stretch the truth let's say he's very unsubtle about it this is always the case it's so it's always hyperbole so one of Donald Trump's first acts when he became president of the Trump Organization when he entered into business as a young man was to hire Roy Cohn the former counsel to commie slamming Senator Joe McCarthy and unsubtle man himself to defend the Trump Organization against a great many other people including Rupert Murdoch and made a lot of very respectable very successful people of course and I'm a defender of Joe McCarthy for that matter so I I don't even consider him disreputable but he it got a little carried far enough okay yeah so Roosevelt Truman and Eisenhower commies was going to was it was a useful hyperbole so yeah but what does that tell us the choice of Roy Cohn relying on Roy Cohn this hard-charging guy never never give up never defend and what effect do you think if any Roy Cohn had on Donald Trump we're all unlicensed psychiatrists but as a historian I'm always careful about mind-reading I in my conversations with them mentioned him now there was no particular reason why he would but but I don't have the impression he was an immense formative influence I think when he even is from the spacious areas of Southern California it may not seem like a great thing but as you would know and many of your viewers would when you move from from z Street in Brooklyn to Manhattan it is a trend it's not far in miles but it's a tremendous cultural and sociological change and and Donald Trump felt he needed a roughed-up lawyer the last thing he wanted is a sort of person that many of us including me have a lot of unpleasant experience with which are ambiguous mealy-mouthed counsel who only reach a point of a general mcarthur like executive decision-making at sending out their invoices the rest of the time all they did was walk and that is not what Donald wanted he wanted a fighter and he wanted someone who would get in the face of his opponents and drive them crazy and Roy Cohn by all accounts were the firm people who've just like them too beautifully liked him and everyone in between agreed that he was very effective absolutely was guy to go to and he also helped introduce him to a lot of people that's right you you write about how Donald Trump was very quick to make good political connections he just clearly seems like an operator and this gets to the last point I won't ask you to predict the future but I will ask you to observe the character of Donald Trump which is that Donald Trump appears to be a survivor by your account and by all that we know of the man he he just survives he makes it out of bankruptcy as he makes it out of difficult situations all the time you opened the account talking about the political assassination of Richard Nixon and it looks like there's deja vu all over again but Trump is a survivor do you think that the bureaucracy the Democrats the media the political establishment are are enough and have enough to succeed in ousting him or do you think that Trump has the character to withstand that assault I am very very completely satisfied that this is a terrible mismatch and Donald Trump is going to wipe the floor with them they had no idea he is he is a fanatically determined man and and he has in the comparison of mr. Nixon he has the advantage of this criminalization of policy differences in this attempt to harass and tear down presidents having gone on for nearly 50 years prior to trumping inaugurated so so he knows how it's worked I mean mr. Nixon who was a great president and what happened to him was a disgrace a terrible thing but to some degree he cooperated inadvertently with his enemies because he didn't handle it properly didn't handle the issue proudly but there's still not a serious case in my opinion he committed any crimes but he did squander his political governance but there had not been discussion of the impeachment of a president from more than a century prior to Watergate and Nixon had no idea how to deal with it then after that you know Bill Clinton fought it out and and and and and in between you had the iran-contra business where they never really got that close to the president cuz Admiral Poindexter said the boat you know the buck stops here that was the end of it and and it was near the end of his term and he was a popular president but the the the impeaches if you will jumped mr. Nixon and there and there was no relevant recent history Trump had all of this pass to go by for tactical planning purposes and and he has a particularly strong and powerful nature of self-defense and and these these people if they had just given to me reasonable Honeyman like most incoming presidents get he would never bother all the stuff about Hillary will be in jail he wouldn't have done a thing but when they attacked him they invented this spurious nonsense about the collusion with a fort from Reagan which no one ever nominated by a major party to put into the office of President in the US whatever have done not Ehrenburg not anybody and that was a declaration of war and and it became a fight to the death and he's going to kill him I mean he is going and I don't mean physically of course but politically he's going to kill him and this is by far the greatest scandal in the history of the United States Watergate was nonsense it was infected nonsense it was a forced entry there was no injury there was no vandalism there was no economic damage it was a bungled investigation that was allowed to hemorrhage and was and was a sort of primal scream therapy for the left-wing press of the United States who then who then spawned generations of people who fancied themselves to be investigative journalists this this is the it's all the shoe is on the other foot and you see the balance tipping these accusers of his are all going to prison and that's where they belong I agree entirely I agree with that account of Watergate entirely because of me at one point in support of something you said just about how asinine his accusers are the righteousness on this business of he lies is at some point during the campaign well on in the campaign he said that Obama was the founder of Isis so the fact-checking department of CNN which has got to be the most under worked organization they're all in Cabo somewhere sipping pina coladas there's the cargo Department of Sanitation under Mayor Daley looked like an efficient operation but the they laborious they went through this process and put up and both Blitzer darting around the studio they're saying no Isis was founded by al Baghdadi and aimed at other Iraqis and and as if Trump meant that our famine there sat there and raised the black flag I mean it is so you're so accurately imbecilic I can hardly imagine it's happening after think it is that's a wonderful way to put it is imbecilic and you're just look and you say I can't tell if these people are being absurdly obtuse or if they're really as dumb as they appear to be and you have such a good point so many of the political problems we're dealing with is because this country took all of the wrong lessons from Watergate from that awful miscarriage of justice around Watergate but we've got a different guy in office now and I agree with your estimation of it I also have to recommend to everybody 'lord black I will let you go finally you've been very generous with your time everybody has to go ahead and read this book it is really really enjoyable it is it's a fair take on Donald Trump it's not fawning it's not attacking him it gives a really fair look at it and it tells you so much that our mainstream media won't tell us because all of the fact checkers are in Cabo sipping pina coladas Lorde black thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it thank you Michael can I just leave you one phrase it's the best and Gorky acute somebody was on a panel with them of being obnoxiously teased it's a wonderful expression I'm gonna have to start using that I'm gonna start going to tweet that at Gorky now I think then obnoxiously obtuse tune in to the Michael Noel's show obnoxiously obtuse thank you Lord black all right before we cut we've got a lot of mailbag to go to before we get to this point I do want to make my most unpopular opinion I'm going to alienate all of the rest of my audience a note on Starbucks a man so there's been a lot of talk in Starbucks there was that black man who was arrested or the cops were called on him because he refused to purchase anything and sat in a Starbucks for a long time and it was all kind of a strange situation and now a man in LA cañada in California says that he is a Hispanic man when he received a cup of coffee with a racial slur on and I'll just say it because you need to hear this learn for the pun and it's not it's sort of a silly slur is the beaner is the name of the that was on the cup so how do we know this only his friend the man's friend has been interviewed about this and the friend doesn't speak in English so he's just talking in Spanish and what he explained though through a translator is that apparently the guy's name is Peter so he said Peter but I don't know if the guy can speak English his friends certainly can't speak English so I said they wrote down beaner to Peter right who knows what happened I don't know what happened it could have been three options right it could have been an honest mistake and like a pretty stupid mistake but it could have been an honest one never never underestimate the stupidity of people when you encounter them so it could have been an honest mistake it could have been an insult there could have been some hateful racist employee who said I'm gonna show this guy who doesn't possibly speak English anyway but I'll show him I'll get a kick out of it okay could have been that or it could have been a hoax it could have just been a hoax I hate to there everyone's gonna call me a bigot now for saying it could be a hoax we've seen a ton of these hoaxes all over the place we've seen it on the issue of gay cakes you remember there's like a gay guy said that someone wrote a derogatory slur on his cake that he bought in a bakery they that he wrote it himself we've seen racial hoaxes around the country we've seen a lot of these sort of hoaxes I suppose it could have been that the question you have to ask yourself is what is the point here is that is the allegation that Starbucks is racist Starbucks which makes a point to be as progressive on questions of race as possible as Starbucks which is so overwhelmingly pushing all of those progressive narratives that really secretly it's this Confederate holdout that hates racial minorities is that what they're saying nobody believes that everybody is just pretending it's a I kind of like it on the Left because it's a circular firing squad they all just keep killing each other rhetorically killing each other I don't want that to be misinterpreted - now that's gonna be the next boycott they're gonna boycott the whole show you know obnoxiously obtuse but the but the question with Starbucks is what do people really think nobody really believes that Starbucks is racist on the point of Starbucks I love Starbucks I think it's just terrific I love Starbucks I don't know it's overpriced it's not overpriced Dunkin Donuts is more expensive per ounce of coffee than Starbucks Dunkin Donuts is dirty Dunkin Donuts you know has that awful fluorescent lighting most of the people there don't speak English at the ones that I've gone to they give you way too much milk when you ask for just a drop of milk I go to my beautiful Starbucks it smells great the baristas are smiling they have silly purple hair and weird piercings I don't care I find it sort of charming in my barista I go in I can plug in my computer I can sit I can use a clean bathroom I can do work for hours and hours I just have to buy a $2 cup of coffee I get unlimited refills I love Starbucks Starbucks has done more for cities in this country and around the world than any other organization in history because it is the best public bathroom in any any city in the history of the world I love Starbucks the lefties now don't like it because it's allegedly racist conservatives don't like it because it's so just obnoxiously liberal I don't care it's a good company it grew very big because it offered a good product enough I will defend Starbucks even poor Starbucks whom nobody likes anymore we have a lot in the mail back to get to but you've got to go to Daley wire calm you have to I'm sorry but we had a really good mailbag today we have to burn through it in like six minutes so go to Daley why calm right now what do you get you getting me you get the end reclaim ensure you get the magic Bureau show you just ask questions in a mailbag like the one that we're just about to go to you can't ask questions in the conversation the next one up is the big boss ben shapiro and none of that matters mmmmmm so these are the leftist tears this is coming out of the leftist years tumblr lord Conrad black has just suggested that members of Hillary Clinton's cabal could go to jail because they lied under oath they've we've seen the mainstream media and the Democrats defending violent Psychopaths gang members who behead little children probably won't look that good in November get this before it's too late because otherwise you're gonna drown and that'll be no good go to daily wire comm we'll be right back with the mailbag we're gonna burn through these questions because I want to spread all of the cough fa to all of the people have asked first from Amy hi Michael how would you solve the homelessness problem in LA a bulldozer probably or maybe a steamroller in the Knowles mayorship in LA I am only slightly kidding the answer is police though because this has worked in other cities it would work in LA we have a terrible mayor in Eric Garcetti we have an awful administration they're destroying this city huge surges in people sleeping on the street and committing crimes on the street and it's just awful because this mayor is terrible the police should approach homeless people every time they see them and offer three choices shelters psych wards or jail those that those are the three choices shelters psych wards were Jail so just to begin I would stop subsidizing homelessness which the City of LA does you can get a ton of benefits you can get all of these really nice things the police don't bother you they construct whole city's terrible crime ridden little tent cities under bridges in otherwise nice neighborhoods they've destroyed downtown LA I would stop subsidizing homelessness and I would start arresting people if they refused shelter I forget who said this I think Giuliani said this a few years ago sleeping on the street is a dysfunctional Act which harms the individual who does it and society at large people have no right to do it they have no right to sleep on the streets that is public property they have no right to do it Giuliani did this in the 90s he sent the cops and said you either go to that shelter you get arrested you go and it worked it worked because nobody benefits there's nothing compassionate about letting these people sleep on the street nothing compassionate at all it's cruel to let people do it the compassionate solution is to give these people help and get them off the street nobody benefits from letting vagabonds and psychotics and drug addicts sleep there least of all them there are AM place'll homeless shelters in LA it creates a lot of dangerous situations excuse me I saw this in New Haven when I would live there there was a tent city that sprung up and everyone said oh that's so nice let's all be compassionate cool man I was one of the few people on campus who said this is really a terrible idea they said how cruel of you to say that how awful and sure enough within a matter of days a woman was raped in that camp that bad things happen when you let people sleep on the street wouldn't tolerate it and a compassionate and serious administration wouldn't tolerate it from James James hey Michael I'm sure you have recently seen the video where the Pope answered the question of a dead a theists son if not I have seen it but I'll read this for everyone else if not the boy said his dad was an atheist but still baptized his four children he asked if his dad was going to heaven the Pope replied something to the effect of this was a father who loved his kids he got them all baptized what do you think do you think God would keep this man out of heaven of course not in other words the Pope answered that even though the dad thought Jesus was as fake as the tooth fairy this guy would still make it into heaven because he baptized his four kids what do you make of this thanks James well I would say first of all I can't blame Pope Francis for some poor little boy comes up and says my daddy's dead is he roasting in hell for eternity was Pope Francis supposed to say yeah he is you bet kid and you better watch out or you'll end up there too no but on the but again we're talking about the truth not just comfort and even on the mat the question of truth I will point out the father baptized his four kids why did he do that if he thinks Jesus is just as fake as the tooth fairy why did he baptize his four kids I don't know our faculties of reason are quite limited very frequently we convince ourselves of things that we know really aren't true I'm sort of convinced that there aren't really atheists at all nor McDonald has a bit on this he says you know the reason there can't be a theist is if you don't believe in something you usually don't spend all of your time thinking about it like a atheists to that line an atheist a vegan and a crossfitter walk into a bar how do I know they told me within two seconds the atheists they're always talking about God they're always grappling with God so I don't really buy it and moreover I can't say who's in heaven or who's in hell I really can't do that I do not even know definitively if Judas Iscariot is in hell I have my suspicions you know but I you can't say that indefinitely had a conversion and repentance at the very end as he's hanging on that noose who knows so I really I think there there is a lot to question in this pontificate I've put up put that very diplomatically but I actually don't think his interaction with that kid is one of them I think the answer was perfectly fun from Dylan hello king of trolls can I get a happy birthday thanks Dylan no from Andy no I'm kidding okay happy birthday Dylan from Andy hey Michael do you foresee a breaking point for the left it seems they pin themselves into identity politics which almost forces them to continue becoming more and more extreme or I suppose always forces them as a college student I was surprised to see that a lot of my classmates and friends find this way of thinking useless and counterproductive contrary to popular belief there are a lot of us that actually crave genuine debate and an exchange of ideas and it seems to me that this postmodern way of thinking makes honest conversation impossible could we see a reduction in this way of thinking in the Democrat Party I do not see them being able to win elections with this message or lack thereof thanks yeah they're gonna have to change or they're gonna die as a political party again I'm speaking rhetorically I just wanna be very clear the the Democratic Party has has moved in this way really since the ascendance of Barack Obama into this very vicious divisive angry identity politics which says we don't like America we want to fundamentally transform America we don't like our countrymen you have privilege you have this you have that and let's free me during that period of time they lost a thousand seats across the country during the the presidency of Barack Obama it lost a thousand seats across the country they lost the house they lost the Senate they ultimately lost the presidency to Donald Trump you know what a lot of people think Donald Trump wasn't a great candidate for president I won't go into that here but if you think that the fact that even that candidate was able to win tells you something about the state of the Democrats so I hope they don't change I hope they keep keep it up keep it right up and the Republicans are gonna rule for the next century from James we'll get a couple more good sir Michael canola's according to the political spectrum is Islam considered extreme right-wing religious conservative or has it been co-opted by the leftists in America in Europe for identi politics and is now a far left ideology similar to fascism particularly National Socialism sidenote thank you for keeping the cigar industry alive as well I'm also an enthusiast particularly of the Maduro variety great commentaries always Jim a very good question the left certainly has embraced Islam they've invented that word Islamophobia to smear people who don't want to get their heads chopped off or something I don't I don't know exactly what the word means but with regard to the left-right spectrum here I don't think you can fit everything neatly into those categories and frankly even using those terms sometimes plays into the modernist hand it it doesn't really get to what you're talking about the terms right and left they come from the French Revolution in 1789 relatively recently in historical terms supporters of the king and religion at the National Assembly were seated on the president's right and supporters of the French Revolution were seated on his left that's where we get it from that's the whole place left and right and the French Revolution referred to seating not necessarily ideology so and actually at the time the right sort of opposed this breakdown because they opposed shallow factions and political parties but because the left-right spectrum originates in this radical modernity and the French Revolution it doesn't really capture the variety of political views conservatives just to use one of the examples you give conservatives always quibble over whether fascism is on the left or the right in some ways it seems like it's right-wing because there's a great love of country you could say in fascism but in some ways it's obviously left-wing it's atheistic usually hostile to religion hostile to many traditions collectivist so it seems rather left-wing there too really what you could say is it's just modern fascism and communism they're two sides of the same coin now this doesn't work when you try to apply it to older ideas what would you call the Aristotelian system of ethics would you call that left or right I don't know predates left and right by thousands of years Islam also predates left and right by a thousand years aslam is not modern what what is Islam Islam is a religion that grew out of a Christian heresy in the seventh century and involved aspects of Arab nationalism pan-arab nationalism and came as a strange new twist on the Abrahamic faiths so I don't really think it's a question of right or left I think you should expand the thought there and make it a question of right or wrong on that point I'll say Islam crucially denies the crucifixion of Christ the conquest of death so when you're trying to answer that question it's a good good one to ask can I do one more will you let me do one more I can do one why I can only do one more let's make it a good one let's make sure that we can do a really good one okay all right we'll just do the next one and then we'll just have to get the rest of them next week from Emily hey Michael I've been reading a hagiography about the life of st. Catherine of Siena it's been a great read but it leaves me with a nagging question st. Catherine had a vision of God at the age of seven she was extremely aware from a young age of the presence of God and his importance in her life why is it that God would give her major confirmation that he exists but others languish in a sea of uncertainty their entire lives her life thanks to revisions was certainly not an easy one but it does seem like a life of virtue would be so much easier if you have zero doubts about God's existence thanks Emily I love st. Catherine of Siena but I don't think a life of virtue is necessarily easier if you have more evidence than others of God's existence just take st. Peter and Judas let's take Judas first Judas spends Christ's ministry with Christ he sees Christ raised dead people to make them living again he sees Christ multiply fishes and to feed thousands of people and bread to feed thousands of people he sees him heals the lame and the blind and the sick and walk on water and then he betrays him but he saw it he know he sees Christ as who he is he sees the incarnation of God he betrays him anyway st. Peter st. Peter sees the Transfiguration of Christ on the mountain he sees this unbelievable vision you knows for certain the father reveals to Peter that Christ is the Christ and what does he do he denies him three times what he doesn't he denies him three times so I don't know that that's necessarily the case it just in one's own experience if you've ever had a numinous experience or religious experience of God it's unmistakable when it happened it's unmistakable it's also ineffable so it's not much use trying to explain it but it's unmistakable when it happens use you're shocked by this you're in all holy fear and then like five minutes later you just start sitting again you know it's not it's not funny it's kind of sad but just you have this experience and then regardless you fall away because it's a fallen world and that's an aspect of human nature so I don't know about that the evidence for God is ample and there were no good arguments for atheism there just temptations basically they're just temptations and all of us have temptations st. Catherine of Siena as well okay hope that helps there are other so many other good questions we'll just bring them back next week have a good weekend I'll see you on Monday I'm Michael Doyle this is the Michael Noel's show I will see you Monday the Michael Nolt show is produced by seniya Villarreal executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising producer mathis Glover and our technical producer is Austen Stevens edited by Jim nickel audio is mixed by Mike core Amina hair and makeup is by Jeshua alvera the Michael Noel's show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for word publishing 2018 you
