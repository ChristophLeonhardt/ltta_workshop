oh hi priests Clavin praise be unto you I met a girl who shares all the same values I do she is Christian and conservative she is beautiful and I think she may be the loveliest woman I have ever met so far I'm not seeing the problem she's moving to Texas in a month and I live in Virginia I feel it is extremely rare to find someone with these beliefs in 2017 I believe there is an unspoken attraction between us and I am unsure whether to say anything or not since you will be moving a good distance away soon I would like to pursue this further but it seems in vain since we will hardly ever see each other what should I do Kyle Kyle congratulations you have asked me the easiest question I've ever received make your move gam boon go go for it dude if this is if this is the right woman it will all work out if it's not it won't you know I mean that's the thing but do not do not let her get away do not let her get on that plane without telling her how you feel you don't have to make a big show out of it just talk to her just say what you said basically to me to her you know I mean that I felt there was something between us and I think you are terrific and a lovely person and you know we share a lot of values and I would like to stay in touch you know distance you know I would say that love conquers all but distance is not the biggest problem we actually they have injected invented this gigantic thing flies through the sky between Virginia and Texas you will be able to visit they've invented the internet you will be able to see one another but don't let her get away I mean come on that's an easy right I mean I said that's an easy one I'm sorry
