Andrew thanks for being with us given a non-opec production struggles shale gas etc what are your current views on crude oil for the market for 2010 well first off thank you heather for being here and see it's my pleasure take a look in the 2010 our commodity price forecast for oil is 475 dollars a barrel oil has remained much firmer than the natural gas over the last 12 months and the forward curve is it still hoping up that strength so we're optimistic that as the economy kind of regained some footing that you know oil price war remain firm that's a little bit under Iran's forecast of 100 others we've a barrel certainly I mean that there are folks out there who think that the political risk component could always come back into playing a much larger fashion but you know we tend to be a little more traditional and think well you know let's think on supply and demand and ultimately i think what comes down to global growth what were the growth rates in the fourth quarter and last year on the oil side you know we're starting to get numbers right now with earnings coming out of most of the companies that i cover we're reporting really in two weeks overall the initial data points have been excuse me on the smaller mid-cap side that we've had a little bit of production declines really reflecting a year of reduced capital spending and lower rig counts sir producers hedging going into 2010-11 and what does that mean for the gas bowls yes producer is generally heads for to project cash flows and as we look in 2010 with a higher oil and gas futures curve the additional hedging that my companies have added in had largely been to protect 2010 activity which again following on 2009 where activity was very low now that provides an opportunity to develop more production growth those capex budgets are they growing and is that going to continue throughout the year yes capex so far has been up I think around ten to fifteen percent across my companies and I think really coming out of winter in my mind skizz that if gas prices and seventy percent of my companies or my companies produce on average seventy percent natural gas if gas prices soften from the kind of 556 our level out there currently at then we could see softening and capex otherwise i would expect it because of the hedging because of the forward curve that will see kind of the current spending plans kind of sustained through the year so even oil opponents are saying we're going to have to start drilling in the US what does that mean for domestic oil companies well I mean there's certainly a lot of oil potential in the US the question is what time frame will it take to get the oil to market I mean that's it's certainly a very complex question you know from my standpoint you know we've seen discoveries in parts of the Gulf of Mexico that a peep a lot of interest here in the last month that Plus that you know the addition of shale gas over the last couple of years you know provides an interesting opportunity for us to increase our indigenous oil and gas supplies so there was a new accounting standard that I believe was applied to your company's is this last a quarter or this last year what what is that and how does it how does it affect your companies or how you look at them sure it really has to do with how oil and gas reserves are priced historically the old rule was that you would use the price in effect on December 31st and companies were concerned you know in prior years that if you had a lot of volatility that the December 31st price did not reflect real kind of sustainable kind of activity and so the SEC moved last year to go to a essentially average price for the year and so this will be the first year that we see those prices roll through the reserve reports given recent acquisitions in the space Exxon XTO do you see that continuing or is it more of joint ventures or is it outright sales I mean in the oil and gas space there's always a healthy amount of properties divestitures and acquisitions and across what with most of my companies being kind of under five billion a market cap that they tend to be more active at than the larger players if you look at 1998 in 2004 Big Ma waves you know that those kicked off in the summertime and night 98 with I think BP buying amico and ExxonMobil as well as in 2004 with some of the you know the small and mid-cap guys kind of consolidating now if thats suggest that maybe heading into the spring you know if commodity prices soften again that we could see additional M&A activity great thank you Andrew thank you
