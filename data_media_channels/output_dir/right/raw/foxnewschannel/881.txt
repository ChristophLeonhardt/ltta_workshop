00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:05,434
IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME WORKING

3
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:07,202
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MAKE THE

4
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:09,805
WORLD A BETTER PLACE I DON'T

5
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:13,408
GIVE A [BLEEP].

6
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:16,979
>> CONGRESSMAN, THIS HAS BEEN A

7
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:19,581
LONG TIME EFFORT ON YOUR PART TO

8
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:20,716
GET TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

9
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:21,083
REPORT.

10
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:25,387
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

11
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:27,456
OVER 500 PAGES.

12
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:28,624
I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO READ

13
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:31,260
IT ALL, BUT I WILL BEFORE MY

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,163
SHOW TOMORROW NIGHT.

15
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:36,832
YOUR TAKE, CONGRESSMAN?

16
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:40,369
>> WHAT IT'S DONE, IT'S

17
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,771
VINDICATED TRUMP ON BOTH PRONGS

18
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,407
OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

19
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:48,043
YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT INSPECTOR

20
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:49,878
GENERAL SAYING COMEY SHOULD BE

21
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:50,179
FIRED.

22
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,480
I THAT SAID AND YOU BELIEVE

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:51,780
THAT.

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,016
THE IDEA YOU WILL HAVE AN

25
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,616
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

26
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:56,518
INVESTIGATION BECAUSE TRUMP

27
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,887
FIRED THE FBI DIRECTOR WHO THE

28
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:02,391
IG ACKNOWLEDGED HAD NO BUSINESS

29
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:06,094
BEING THE FBI DIRECTOR IS A

30
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:06,762
FARCE.

31
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:08,664
AND THIS SO-CALLED COLLUSION

32
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:09,898
NARRATIVE, THEY DIDN'T GIVE THAT

33
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:12,067
TEXT MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS

34
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:14,369
WHEN WE ASKED WHERE STRZOK SAID

35
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,072
WE WILL STOP TRUMP FROM BECOMING

36
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:17,472
PRESIDENT.

37
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:20,309
6 DAYS EARLIER HE OPENED UP A

38
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:20,876
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE

39
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:24,012
INVESTIGATION AGAINST TRUMP'S

40
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:24,379
CAMPAIGN.

41
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,881
THIS WHOLE THING IS AFFECTED

42
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:29,551
WITH BIAS AND IT NEEDS TO STOP.

43
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,486
>> CONGRESSMAN GATES, WITH

44
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:34,156
RESPECT TO WHAT HE SAID, ONE OF

45
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:37,693
THE DAMNING TEXT MESSAGES HAD TO

46
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:39,027
DO WITH STRZOK SAYING DON'T

47
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:39,895
WORRY ABOUT IT.

48
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:42,097
WE WILL STOP IT WHEN ASKED DO

49
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:44,166
YOU THINK HE WILL EVER BE

50
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:44,766
ELECTED PRESIDENT?

51
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:46,802
THAT INFORMATION WAS NOT GIVEN

52
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:47,669
TO CONGRESS.

53
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,671
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO

54
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,907
ABOUT IT BESIDES GET ON A SHOW

55
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:52,674
AND COMPLAIN ABOUT IT?

56
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:56,144
>> FRANKLY, I THINK WE NEED TO

57
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:56,845
IMPEACH ROB ROSENSTEIN.

58
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:58,747
THESE TEXT MESSAGES THAT SHOWED

59
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:00,749
THERE WAS AN EFFORT NOT ONLY TO

60
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:01,650
REFLECT BIAS AGAINST THE

61
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,553
PRESIDENT BUT TO MANIFEST THAT

62
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:06,788
BIAS IN A WAY THAT IMPACTED

63
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:11,026
PEOPLE'S OFFICIALACS AS

64
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:15,898
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES IS

65
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:16,331
REPREHENSIBLE.

66
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:19,501
THIS WAS BACKFIELD OUT.

67
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,639
-- BLACKED OUT.

68
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,407
IT WAS EMBARRASSING TO THE FBI

69
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:29,177
THEY HAD SWAMP ALLIGATORS DOING

70
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:30,646
EVERYTHING TO BE DESTRUCTIVE.

71
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:31,880
>> WHAT IS FRUSTRATING WHEN THE

72
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,449
VIEWERS WATCH THIS AND LAST

73
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,018
NIGHT I WAS ON SEAN HANNITY'S

74
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,386
SHOW WHEN HE WAS HOSTING.

75
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:38,387
IT'S SO SAD.

76
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:41,123
I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN THE SYSTEM.

77
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:44,526
CAN AMERICANS BELIEVE IN THE FBI

78
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:48,297
BASE UPON ON THE FACT IT SEEMS

79
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:49,331
LONG-TERM DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE

80
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:50,098
TO THE INSTITUTION?

81
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:50,966
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY

82
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,035
QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

83
00:02:53,035 --> 00:02:55,570
IT'S NOT JUST STRZOK AND PAGE.

84
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,706
THERE WERE OTHER FBI AGENTS.

85
00:02:57,706 --> 00:03:00,575
ONE SAID AFTER TRUMP WON WHO WAS

86
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:01,877
PART OF THE HILLARY

87
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,512
INVESTIGATION AND PART OF THE

88
00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:06,348
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, HE SAID,

89
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:07,616
VIVA LARESISTANCE.

90
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:09,151
THIS IS A GUY WORKING WITH

91
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:10,385
MUELLER?

92
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:11,954
GIVE ME A BREAK.

93
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,555
YOU ALSO HAVE ALL OF THE LEAKING

94
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:15,324
IN THE REPORT.

95
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:18,493
SHOWING THE CASCADE OF LEAKS.

96
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:21,129
YOU HAVE AGENTS GETTING GIFTS

97
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:21,897
FROM REPORTERS.

98
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:26,368
THERE ARE BROAD PROBLEMS IN THE

99
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:27,302
HEADQUARTERS THERE.

100
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:28,870
>> EVERYONE IS FRUSTRATED.

101
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,940
WE KNOW IT'S WRONG.

102
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,811
WE KNOW JOE WOULD BE IN JAIL.

103
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:36,845
BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

104
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:40,449
>> HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.

105
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:41,516
THE TEXT MESSAGE.

106
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:43,218
EITHER ROB ROSENSTEIN KNEW THAT

107
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:44,553
TEXT MESSAGE HAD NOT BEEN

108
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:44,920
PRODUCED.

109
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,155
IF THAT'S THE CASE HE NEEDS TO

110
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:47,456
GO.

111
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,992
OR HE WAS NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH

112
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:54,896
TO GET US THE INFORMATION WE

113
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:55,263
ASKED.

114
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:56,999
HE SHOULD GO.

115
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,034
>> ALL RIGHT.

116
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:02,804
AND CONGRESSMAN GATES, I HEARD

117
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:04,373
EVERYBODY SAY ROSENSTEIN SHOULD

118
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:04,906
BE GOING.

119
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:07,576
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT

120
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:07,843
IT?

121
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:10,846
>> WE NEED TO FILE ARTICLES OF

122
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:11,747
IMPPEACHMENT.

123
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:14,816
THIS IS THE SAME ROB ROSENSTEIN

124
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:17,052
WHO SAID.

125
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:17,586
>> WHEN?

126
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:18,086
>> IMMEDIATELY.

127
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:19,421
>> WHAT DO YOU NEED?

128
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:21,390
>> 218 VOTES IN THE CONGRESS OF

129
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,058
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO

130
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:24,393
STAND UP AGAINST THE DEEP STATE

131
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:27,829
THAT IS WORKING AGAINST OUR

132
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:28,397
PRESIDENT TODAY.

133
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:29,531
WHAT DOES PETER STRZOK STILL

134
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,732
HAVE A JOB?

135
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:32,634
STILL AN ALLIGATOR CRAWLING

136
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:33,568
AROUND IN THE SWAMP OF

137
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,403
WASHINGTON, D.C.?

138
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,104
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF HIM.

139
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:38,740
THE FACT WE HAVE NOT SHOWS A

140
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,078
LOCK OF LEADERSHIP FOR THE FBI

141
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,479
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

142
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,115
>> HE MIGHT BE COOPERATING?

143
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:53,655
BUT I SAY TO MYSELF, WHO IS HE

144
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:55,090
COOPERATING WITH?

145
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,627
>> EXACTLY.

146
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:01,596
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT.

147
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:02,831
I WOULD SAY YOU HOLD THESE

148
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,332
PEOPLE IN CONTEMPT.

149
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:06,468
IF THEY DON'T PRODUCE WHAT WE

150
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:08,470
WANT YOU MOVE TO IMPEACH THEM

151
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,305
AND REMOVE THEM FROM OFFICE.

152
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:11,940
IF WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE THAT

153
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,475
POWER, WE WILL HAVE THE SAME

154
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:15,343
STUFF WHEN WE COME ON YOUR SHOW

155
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:17,712
AND COMPLAIN AND DON'T GET ANY

156
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:18,046
RESULTS.

157
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:21,583
WE HAVE TO USE THE POWER WE

158
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:21,883
HAVE.

159
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:25,854
>> CONGRESSMAN, WHAT GATES JUST

160
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:29,624
SAID WAS WE NEED OVER 200 VOTES

161
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:32,461
FOR AN ACTUAL IMPEACHMENT OF

162
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:32,861
ROSENSTEIN.

163
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:33,728
EVERY TIME SOMETHING COMES OUT

164
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:36,298
WE SAY THIS IS ANOTHER REASON TO

165
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:37,365
IMPEACH HIM.

166
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:40,302
>> IF YOU HAVE A SPEAKER OF THE

167
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:41,770
HOUSE EXERCISING LEADERSHIP AND

168
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,672
THE MAJORITY LEADER AND THEY SAY

169
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:45,373
ROSENSTEIN HAS TO GO, THEY COULD

170
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,575
MARSHALL THE SUPPORT OF THE

171
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:47,109
CONGRESS.

172
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:49,377
IT WOULD NOT COME TO AN

173
00:05:49,377 --> 00:05:49,778
IMPEACHMENT.

174
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:51,079
WHEN YOU LOSE THE SUPPORT OF THE

175
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,247
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP IN A

176
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:55,517
POSITION LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T

177
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:55,784
GO.

178
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:57,986
IF WE PUT A RESOLUTION ON THE

179
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,154
FLOOR SAYING ROSENSTEIN SHOULD

180
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:02,724
GO AND THAT PASSED HE WOULD BE

181
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:03,125
DONE.

182
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:10,599
WE NEED PEOPLE TO EXERCISE

183
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:10,999
LEADERSHIP.

184
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:14,102
>> WHY ISN'T PAUL RYAN DOING

185
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:14,402
THIS?

186
00:06:14,402 --> 00:06:15,770
>> HAVE HIM ON YOUR SHOW.

187
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,139
>> I WILL CALL HIM TOMORROW

188
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:17,506
NIGHT.

189
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:22,010
FINAL QUESTION, IN TERMS OF THE

190
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,884
FBI, DOUBLE THAT CHRISTOPHER

191
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:31,653

194
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,047
WRAY WHO WATCHED THIS AND DIDN'T

TAKE A WREC

196
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:42,397

207
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,134
>> CHRISTOPHER WRAY NEEDS TO

208
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:48,236
IMMEDIATELY FIRE PETER STRZOK

209
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:50,305
AND TAKE SWIFTER ACTION.

210
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:51,273
I BELIEVE CHRISTOPHER WRAY

211
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:54,376
UNDERSTANDS HOW DAMAGING THE ACT

212
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,343
OF THE ANTI-TRUMP PEOPLE WERE TO

213
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:56,044
THE FBI.

214
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:57,312
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

215
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:58,346
DOCUMENTS THAT GET TO THE ROOT

216
00:06:58,346 --> 00:06:58,914
OF THIS.

217
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,849
THE ROOT IS RUSSIA.

218
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,217
THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF THE

219
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:03,251
HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION.

220
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:06,888
THEY WANTED TO LAUNCH A PHONEY

221
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:07,856
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

222
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:08,890
I DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

223
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,092
ANYBODY UNTIL THE DOCUMENTS ARE

224
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:11,593
TURNED OVER.

225
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,595
>> THE PROBLEM WITH NOT GETTING

226
00:07:13,595 --> 00:00:00,000
RID OF STRZOK, IF HE IS
