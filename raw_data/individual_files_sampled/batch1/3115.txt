the millennium bear is pure marketing the only thing is you've got a crease in this particular tag which decreases value so I know like with like mistakes that people tended to want them that's a myth it is that's a myth let's start with the Princess Diana beanie bear now let's talk a little bit about her beanie babies actually work so out of the protective cube which is a good idea first of all the Princess Diana beanie baby has been very very popular why well of course she raised a lot of money for the Princess Diana Memorial Foundation Fund she's introduced 1997-1998 and they're a couple things you want to look for now protective tag covers there's the ear tag and there's the touch tag on every single beanie baby if you don't have one of the tags it's not worth as much I always like people to actually take a look at condition cuz people are just saying what about the tags the people who don't know what they're talking about with respect to expertise about beanie babies are only focusing on tags there's a lot to focus on not only tags so I want you to look at condition so if you were to sit your beanie baby in your hand I want you to look here at this area to see how the PE or PVC pellets have deteriorated over time okay condition is two collectibles what location is to real estate it has to be in good shape first of all you have the protective cover the plastic covers are a great thing to have and then this one just opens right up can you open that up for me the gloves are to protect the objects from the oils on my hands so they don't get transferred any expert who's not wearing gloves to handle your object is not an expert the piece is like this one that have PE pellets are worth less than those that have PVC pellets this particular piece is worth about $100 as it is with PE pellets in this condition which is good condition it's not excellence not mint it's not very good in good condition and they sell for that that's based on a sales record retail where someone actually paid that much for similar piece in good condition the Millennium now is your marketing the millennium bear is pure marketing at the time of the millennium we're saying oh it's gonna be there mm and this is very important we've got a new millennium so they start to create these particular bears so this particular bear has is also has a condition issue and we have to look at the tag now it has this hologram on the back of the tag and the hologram touch tags are relatively collectible value on this piece is about $25 so Maureen this is Valentino and he was very popular every Valentine's Day so far the boyfriend who didn't know what to get you right and he can afford jewelry he's getting a Valentino right so basically what you're seeing here is the Valentino beanie babies made with PVC pellets okay so that's one of your check marks for is it valuable he's in good condition around the torso okay looks like the PVC pellets have not deteriorated after being seated for all this time you're seeing also that there is a little bit of dirt you can see a little bit of real oil from the hands a little bit of dirt in the back mainly around the ear and then you have the original hartney of the original bow and the like but typically the nose color is going to be important the brown nose versus the black nose so Valentino is relatively important he's also made in 1993 and introduced in 1993 which is quite old for of course the beanie babies the introductory years of the beanie babies value on this about $100 Wow now doesn't have the same historical background as of course the Princess Diana but the Princess Diana is much younger to that wouldn't that be any baby from 1997 this one from 1993 so that's a nice one too and highly collectible lots of people have it with the brown nose you have a pretty good collection there are some that are here that are pretty interesting like this one this one is pati the platypus pati the platypus is one of the nine original beanie babies and they come up all the time their date to 1993 and the only thing is you've got a crease in this particular tag which decreases value a little bit so she's worth about $60 in this condition so that's what you have here then there are some that aren't worth much at all you're gonna find actually beanie babies that are worth a buck oh my hand a buck and they cost more than that when they were made right attaboy yeah today the market is dropped on these certain other ones that aren't worth all that much if we're gonna go through and of course it's good that you put them in the bag some of them are not worth the cost of the bag this one because this one is just sort of the free-for-all party beanie baby would have been used all the time not particularly again popular and notice the your Valentino had a brown nose and this one has is the same doll basically with a black nose worth less about a buck so these are the tiny beanies for the baby beanies and you know little kids love small so these tiny ones well popular are worth about 10 to 50 cents apiece so some even drop it yeah yeah because they were probably utilized and then taken out of the original packages original packaging is very important these would have had an original package where others done anytime you have a collection and you increase you can increase value just by buying more so people go I didn't know that anytime you add to your collection you actually increase the value a little bit of the entire collection so is good a little bit crazy tell me about Bongo so you bought Bongo the monkey yes and what happened so I know like with like mistakes that people tended to want them well that's a myth it is that's a myth all this information about mistakes is one of the big myths on the internet people sometimes do it for sport that give you misinformation or they discredit experts all that information about oh it has this mistake oh it has that mistake not always relates to value now this becomes a conditioned issue yeah you wrote on this for mom so she wrote on and it's lovely yeah it's a nice sentiment but sentiment just decreased about okay so don't write on the time but yeah all this thing about mistakes on tags yes mistakes can have an impact on value but usually it's a myth that it's going to spike value so that's bonk of the monkey let's talk about some of the other words they're not worth all that much for example your unicorns are not worth all that much they don't collect very well any ones that relates to a particular situation or time period in this particular case the season of you know graduation seasons oftentimes the beanie baby pumpkins are not all that collectible these are all oftentimes worth somewhere around a buck a piece so about a dollar a piece so you want to try to think about those you know a Santa Claus that is a beanie baby not usually very collectible so again these are about a dollar each they're fine they're good to collect they're good stocking stuffers but beyond that they're not the same kind of collectible element as others might be then they're them's what I call the middle range beanie babies like inky and hippity and hoppity that were always of course the bunny rabbits that were very popular inky the squid who's popular and this is just for basic popularity sake so these become relatively important and I'm scanning as we look to see which other ones Oh Clawd the crab here is oftentimes quite popular sorry to reach over you there Cara so that's what you're looking at versus so these are anywhere between 15 and 35 dollars apiece okay okay so these are relatively valuable but the most valuable group are some that you have right here you have almost the whole group of the original nine beanie babies and they include chocolate the moose legs the Frog Squealer the pig this is patty the platypus and pincers the lobster so of the original nine you have five the other ones are splash flash ones a dolphin ones a whale and spot the dog who I looked and you don't seem to have spa unfortunately so basically what you're looking at are these and these are a really good collection of the original nine to have five of the original line is pretty good I've had of course some clients who have all nine so these range in value between about 125 and 150 dollars apiece they're worth more because you keep them in a collection if you had all nine or if you're at your mom's house you're like wow we found another table of beanie babies which might happen at your mom's house right possible then basically you might be able to actually increase the value but anytime you add to that collection you increase value a little bit more so these are about 150 apiece they're all in very good shape chocolate is among one of the most popular and sometimes he sells as high as 250 your condition on chocolate is not worth that okay okay so these are the real values this is what they're really worth so good handbooks the McDonald's ones are usually less valuable okay unless they're within a collection of other McDonaldland toys okay I have like full collection full collection so whole collection will increase value about 20% because you've already assembled a collection for the next guy that has a value to it because that person doesn't have to run around and do the work that you and your mother did going to Canada getting them here going to gift shop right but these books these hand books not only this hand book but any handbook that talks about a value is going to be obsolete about the time right in a minute after it's printed a minute after it's printed it's obsolete and the reason not that it's a bad thing people like it people collect them it shows you the different pieces and it's nice and fun to do but again any of these price guides are only good for the person who's basically writing the price guide because the price can change within a minute of somebody paying more or less than the value in the price guide so I don't care what our antique or collectible it is price guides not really what you're looking for this is really a thing of the past if you retain the tag that's better than just go on okay you know like I threw it out I don't know where it is kind of thing value on this piece is about 25 dollars
