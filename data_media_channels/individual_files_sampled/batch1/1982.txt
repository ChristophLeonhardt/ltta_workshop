hello I'm Sammy Zaidan this is counting the cost on al Jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week investors publicly distanced themselves from Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of a journalist sparks an international outcry we examine what that means for the kingdom's economic ambitions also this week the future of food the new technology trying to shape agriculture plus sunshine and Suk's Tunisia's tourism industry is back in business now the alleged killing of saudi journalist jamal keshavjee at this country's consulate in Istanbul has shocked the world Saudi Arabia is under intense pressure to explain what happened the world's largest oil exporter could face international sanctions the cost of insuring against Saudi default has increased 32 percent that means investors view the country as a much riskier bet now the government may now be forced to raise more debt at a higher cost it's already running a budget deficit the Saudi government is trying to court investment for new cities and projects big names in business and finance ministers including US Treasury Secretary Stephen minuchin are boycotting a key investment event the conference is scheduled to run from October the 23rd to the 25th Rob Matheson reports only last week Christine Lagarde the head of the International Monetary Fund said she was still going to Saudi Arabia even though she was horrified at the disappearance of jamal haji now her office says her trip is being deferred Jamie Dimon the CEO of JPMorgan Chase has also pulled out it's had 85 years of business in Saudi Arabia it began by helping us oil firms start up there Stephen Schwarzman chief executive of Blackstone isn't going either he said to have been one of the first Western finance ears to actively caught crime Prince Mohammed bin Salman Ford of the Ford Motor Company's pulled out - he's blaming a scheduling conflict Ford was hoping to boost sales are to Saudi Arabian woman were allowed to drive media companies including CNBC Financial Times CNN and the New York Times have also withdrawn so have some banks including HSBC BNP Paribas and so cities Jennifer some countries have said they won't not be sending trade delegations but it's important to remember this just because key individuals might not be going that doesn't guarantee their organizations or their countries won't be represented US Treasury Secretary Stephen Minuten and the multinational conglomerate Softbank chose to wait before making a decision this conference was a chance for the Saudis to resuscitate business confidence which has been slacking off in certain sectors for months some investors may now need a lot of persuading well joining me here in Doha is no Harlem Bear Lahore is a senior policy analyst at Qatar University's Social and Economic Survey Research Institute good to have you with us so I guess the reason why the Saudi economies risk profile is rising is because of underlying fears that it might be about to be hit by sanctions or some kind of punitive measures how likely is that scenario to you only time would tell if there are sanctions if there are sanctions that would be terrible for the plans of their young crown prince now whether sanctions are imposed or not in a sense has the damage already been done to investor confidence in Saudi Arabia to a great deal to a great deal because this is not just the first case of that can disrupt the confidence that investors had towards her Arabia in Saudi Arabia a year ago a number of prominent businessman in Rodie Saudi royal family members were arrested in a corruption crackdown the problem is that there was little transparency no real trials and at the end of the day people believed that this was a form of extortion so how people could believe in the judicial system of Saudi Arabia that's also a concern for investors and then there were spats with Germany at low profile higher profile spat with Canada or the human rights and now there is dis latest news which doesn't bode well for tool your investments how justify then our fears that the oil market might be dragged into this given what you're saying well you know the oil market is always a market which is very reactive to news for good or worse generally for worse there are speculators especially very active on the oil market and generally when a bad news happen geopolitical news for instance it does affect negatively deon market meaning the oil price increases this is something the Trump administration doesn't want to see coming they have been very adamant very very insisted insisting very strongly towards the Saudis and other oil producers that they want to have more production to cool down the prices but the contrary might happen if sanctions were imposed the analysts have interpreted some of the Saudi measures as an indication that they are willing to use the oil card should things get messy shall we say in economic ties or sanctions how realistic do you think that card could really be used by Riyadh well we need to distinguish two things the willingness to express to show we're strong to show that we can retaliate if we are meaning the Saudis are to receive sanctions so that they are very clear about that they want to show that they are not a small country that can be bullied but at the same time they don't want to disrupt any global economy because it'll backfire backfire on them - exactly they are completely depending for their oil exports which is their key source of all right let's do you think there is a fair share of bluff but you know this is diplomacy so some investors have already pulled out so what about the Saudi investment conference our so-called Davos of the desert to what extent is that being impacted by the Hoggy affair well we have seen a number of people who had to come who cancelled in in a very in a series of people canceling their coming so this made the news and this is not good for business of course at the same time the conference has its own domestic and regional audience so it was not completely depending on these essentially Western investors but it's a setback for the Saudi economy definitely will it translate into actual a drying up of deal-making a slowing down of FDI acceleration into Saudi Arabia or will business just go on as normal well but that's the problem business as normal is the problem the Saudi Crown Prince wanted to show he could boost the Saudi economy that it could go beyond oil real estate and big infrastructure construction that he could trigger investors to kick-start a knowledge economy to kick-start an industry of robots especially to build hits touristic City but all that seems in jeopardy because these needs fresher capital not just recycling the oil rents but having investors from abroad from the West from China and Japan coming this is less promising so given what you're saying where does that leave vision 2030 then well might happen in 2050 more seriously I think that for now the momentum is not there so they are very unlikely to have the kind of diversification the way it is now they are very unlikely to have the kind of diversification they aspire to well they have to raise more debt than to fund some of these 2030 projects it could be a solution where will that leave the the deficit the budget deficit though well that's the main concern because especially this year they have a significant budget deficit already so this would not be a good sign also for investors because that threatens the currency and so people for now don't know if the macroeconomic indicators of Saudi Arabia will stay stable enough so many investors are waiting and seeing and for now the diversification strategy is not on track a lot of tech companies are funded by Saudi money aren't they is that going to continue after this or the Saudi money becomes something sort of suspect now well there are two things there is investments from technology companies into Saudi Arabia that's what is frozen but money coming from Saudi Arabia will always be well run like spawned on the market yes so beat Silicon Valley beat you know in eastern Asia also where there are some companies that are receiving a lot of investments this will keep on going but the concern again is that the diversification is not happening and has the OGF air do you think pushed the Aramco NE Aramco listing even further back into the horizon I don't think we can link the two things Saudi Aramco IPO was already stalled for a number of reasons some are technical some are more political technical reasons well there is no transparency as to the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia there for long exaggerated how much oil there is in their reserves and now to disclose it to disclose the real reserves because for an IPO you need transparency this is a main problem and on the political side making transparency giving more transparency on how the money from the oil is spent that's a major issue all right no hon thanks so much for talking to us thank you semi some other stories on our radar this week China could be facing a debt iceberg that's according to S&P global the ratings agency is highlighting what it called Titanic credit risks because of underreported local government debt meanwhile the world's number two economy reported its

first tunisia is enjoying a tourism revival the industry had gone into decline following a series of attacks by armed groups on visitors in 2015 mohamed val has the story Tunisia's tourism industry is taken off the sandy beaches of sewers in the north-east are again bustling Sophia amber cloutie is a general manager of Siebel hotel all 480 beds are fully booked even though the hot season has ended although his deserts come to more necesitas in 2017 we started to feel like European tourists are coming back and in 2018 there was a remarkable increase of European tourism especially Western European tourists classic markets like Belgian English Luxembourgers and also French seems like these have not been seen since early 2011 for the uprising that toppled former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali that triggered a series of popular revolts in the region known as the Arab Spring as in all Arab Spring nations Tunisia paid a hefty price for the sudden political upheaval and groups linked to al-qaeda and ISIL staged attacks across the country the bloodiest was on the Bardo Museum in the capital Tunis in March 2015 that killed 22 people 20 of them European tourists the attacks led to a severe drop in visitor numbers hitting the country's economy this is also on politically British considered the hot season has ended but urgent season is excellent as well and there are still lots of hotels which will be full forked over an early November it was positive and statistics are here to confirm that but that situation began to change early 2017 with a marked improvement this year nearly 5.5 million tourists have arrived since January and major European operators including Thomas Cook to you I have resumed holidays to Tunisia the government says it expects visitor numbers to hit a record eight million by the end of the year for Tunisians tourism means not only economic ease but also peace a feeling shared by those arriving in the country safe yes of course I'm safe in Tunisia I like Tunisia very much the people are very kind here old culture good food I like it very much the bazaars in zoos and elsewhere are testament to the changed atmosphere handicraft sellers are again busy on hoping but the bad times are over for good the UN's Food and Agriculture Agency says the world will need to change the way it produces its food in order to cater to an increasing global population Emma Heywood went to Scotland to look at an alternative approach to farming there's no tractor or trailer or reliance on the Sun or the rain instead special lighting is helping this crop of basil and dill to grow this is the UK's first fully automated vertical farm where the vents built into the trays pump the right amount of air to regulate the temperature and humidity we've taken a field we've cut it into tray sized pieces up at six and a half square meters and as you can see behind me we've stacked them up on top of each other then we've put them in a box and we've made the weather inside the box so we've made our own sunshine we've made our own rain we've made our own wind we can heat we can cool we can deal with humidity under this system being developed in Scotland crops can grow quickly using 97 percent less water than normally would be used this method of farming isn't being seen as a replacement for more traditional methods of Agriculture but it could be useful in areas where it's difficult to grow crops and where the climate is extreme and changing the way we produce food will be vital in the future the UN is warning that by 2050 the global population will be more than 9 billion and will need to produce 70% more food to feed everyone this technology allows us to grow food in areas of the world where it's very difficult because of the climate or inators of the world where there's actually very little land available so it changes the whole food system supply chain for example but also seriously reduces the amount of energy and inputs that we have to put into making food they're aiming to be energy neutral as the demands of our population increase so too will our need for innovation well joining me now from Amsterdam is Adam Anders Adam is a co-founder and managing partner at enteric capital good to have you with us so can the world produce enough food for 9 billion people that's the big concern going forward where do you think we're heading you know I think if it's just about delivering calories there is enough land around the world and probably enough resourceful people I think the problem is where that food has to be and whether it's nutritious enough whether it's affordable what exactly is AG tech so for us AG tech is the adoption of new ideas new technologies being digital biotech material sciences applied to any aspect of the food and agriculture value chain that works from the stage of breeding to pesticides on farm practices transportation shelf-life logistics give us some examples though some practical examples of what a normal farm that's converted into AG tag how does it look different and so for example if we're dealing at the farm level you could first of all what AG input the farmer might choose so the genetics the actual performance of the plant how do we know that that plant is suitable for that soil how do we know that the writer model that C is going to be used and then from there once you've actually make a planting decision how can you use data in order to be more precise both about that first moment of planting and then how to treat that that plant as it grows then we go through that treatment process with different forms of pesticide fungicide herbicide traditionally an area where some quite brutal chemicals have been used and it's time to the next generation and then it's harvesting time how do we record that yield how can the farmer best market that product and digital or biotech solutions are available to help every aspect for the power okay but listening to you there one wonders this are we talking about a system of farming that really requires a fundamental maybe complicated set of changes to the whole process of farming you know I don't think so and also farmers can adopt it in different degrees so if it's just a better performing sea in a saline soil or an low moisture environment that's something that could be distributed anywhere in the world and just help productivity and use you can also go very high-tech and be analyzing your farm not even at the field over at the plant level eventually maybe so I think that's going to be up to the farmer is there enough investment going on then in Ag tech because it sounds great the investment activity is moved from let's say five years ago practically non-existent so globally when we started looking at actor ten years ago was three hundred million globally invested a year in the one of the largest centers in the earth these days were looking in the billions an egg tak alone probably three to four billion last year if you include food tech some people say ten billion so it's definitely growing is it enough that I'm not sure about you what about developing countries will they be left behind the AG tech revolution if they're not able to put as much money as others into the game I personally think some of the best opportunities for improvement are in emerging countries and also some of the best opportunities for getting a return on that application of technology for entrepreneurs and that's in part because we've got a very big gap in developed countries farmers are achieving seventy sometimes 80% of yield potential in emerging markets often 30 percent another key reason would be we're seeing a step change in technology where you turn it to going through the farming practices that have helped emerging and the developed markets but arguably these days are holding them back a bit and that links to my third reason why it's going to be great for emerging markets it's less arrogant about how to farm and there's more openness to some of these suggestions than we see in farmers in say the Netherlands taking advice on how to do dairy when they've been world leaders for 400 years in that sector I like the point there are you touched upon an issue you made me think of an issue there when you said there'll be less arrogant how different will the farmer of the future look like then compared to now because when you say farmer you know you kind of think of a chap in a field with a you know raking the field will the farmer instead be sitting on a computer with big data and doing statistical manipulations or something like that look at definitely don't think a computers part of the answer farmers will always want to be in the food and be close to their plants their animals their land and there's a big part of that that's that's a part of grew up on a farm that's a part of being a farmer but using your smartphone or an iPad in order to prioritize what to do that day to know more in more specificity where there might be disease pressure how you can more accurately apply a pesticide or look after your field and actually farming at that more detailed level will be helped by technology I'm quite certain of it whether it be 3d printing our food for example but look I think that's a different solution in a different data set and it's possible that 3d printing will helpful but I don't see that as a fundamental revolution in the same way of what I see happening on the farm I do think it's a novel idea and I think it'll solve some transportation issues some ingredient issues and certainly it can be a lot of fun in terms of different flavors textures and everything else that we're seeing in high-end restaurants alright thanks so much for coming and talking to us about that that's a great pleasure thank you for having me and finally Canada has joined the very exclusive club of countries that allows the sale of recreational marijuana after Uruguay it's only the second country to do so Daniel lack reports from Toronto illegal no more at midnight in the easternmost timezone the first non medicinal cannabis is sold without breaking Canadian law feels great wouldn't you be super happy to if you're the first person in line legalization is being celebrated countrywide and not just by smokers Canadian cannabis companies have seen their share prices soar in recent months as the big day approached there's not one client that I've met yet that has not been touched by the introduction of cannabis in Canada life sciences technology the banking industry retailers but in addition to food and beverage companies you're gonna start seeing a lot of activity as they touch the cannabis market how Canadians buy their cannabis depends on where they live there will be different distribution rules in each of the ten provinces and 3 territories some will have government-run online and real stores other's private retail prices will also differ some critics say that puts too many restrictions on an activity most Canadians have long wanted to be legal we can't really stop it with prohibition we better call it legalization unfortunately the government has tried to maintain all of the details of prohibition and just call it legalizations legalizing cannabis fulfills a campaign promise made in 2015 by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who himself admitted several years ago that he was an occasional user in the past the government is also offering pardons to people convicted of possession now that the drug is legal because cannabis has been outlawed for so long its effects on mind and body are being studied in detail at this Toronto medical lab they're using a simulator to see how drivers who've smoked a joint react to virtual traffic conditions police and Road Safety advisors are also part of the research the most important thing is for drivers to understand what's going on in their bodies and prevent things from happening I think everybody's interested in keeping our world safer so we'll help drivers to maintain that safety polls show most Canadians are not opposed to legal cannabis so long as it could be kept away from children and the multibillion-dollar profits from an industry once dominated by organized crime can be taxed and used to benefit society well that's our show for this week but
