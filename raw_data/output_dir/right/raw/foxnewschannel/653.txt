â™ª

2
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:08,744
>> TODAY WE'RE TALKING

3
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:10,346
TRADE, WE'RE TALKING

4
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:11,981
MILITARY.

5
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:15,317
WE JUST LOOKED AT SOME

6
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:15,918
INCREDIBLE ANTITERRORISM

7
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:19,255
STATES.

8
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:20,789
AND THE RELATIONSHIP IS

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,523
VERY, VERY STRONG.

10
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:25,628
STEVE: THEY GOT PRESIDENT

11
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:32,568
BRIAN: GOING TO HAVE A BIG

12
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:33,469
PRESS CONFERENCE IN TWO

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,769
HOURS.

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,371
THE MEETING COMES AFTER THE

15
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:37,573
PRESIDENT SLAMS THERESA MAY

16
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:38,974
INDIRECTLY KIND OF OVER HER

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,679
FOR U.S. RELATIONS FOR THE

18
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,416
AINSLEY: HERE TO REACT IS

19
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:49,118
U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,918
LEADER AND FOX NEWS

21
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,187
CONTRIBUTOR AND OUR FRIEND

22
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:52,621
NIGEL FARAGE.

23
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:53,822
GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS

24
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:54,156
MORNING.

25
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:55,124
>> GOOD MORNING.

26
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:55,758
AINSLEY: HE HAD THE

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,592
INTERVIEW WITH THE SUN AND

28
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:58,761
HE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT

29
00:00:58,762 --> 00:00:59,928
THERESA MAY THE SOFT EXIT

30
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:00,596
FROM BREXIT.

31
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:01,864
THAT'S NOT WHAT HE

32
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:02,264
RECOMMENDED.

33
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:03,799
IF SHE MAINTAINS CLOSE TIES

34
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,434
WITH THE EU, THEN THAT

35
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:07,202
LUCRATIVE U.S. TRADE DEAL IS

36
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:07,970
HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

37
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,905
HE WAS PRAISING BORIS

38
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,273
JOHNSON, SAYING HE WOULD BE

39
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:11,840
A GOOD PRIME MINISTER.

40
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:12,741
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

41
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:13,776
ALL OF THIS RIGHT BEFORE IS

42
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:14,576
HE SITTING DOWN WITH THE

43
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:16,679
PRIME MINISTER?

44
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:16,979
>>

45
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,247
THIS INTERVENTION HAS COME

46
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:19,315
AS A BOMBSHELL TO THE

47
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:20,749
ESTABLISHMENT HERE IN

48
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,720
AND THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR

49
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,390
KILLER LINE.

50
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:29,992
IT'S WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

51
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:31,927
SAYS THIS IS NOT THE BREXIT

52
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:35,264
THAT PEOPLE VOTED FOR.

53
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,666
WHAT HE IS REFERRING TO IS A

54
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:38,801
MEETING OF THE U.K. CABINET

55
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:41,270
A WEEK AGO TODAY WHERE THEY

56
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:45,174
AGREED TO WATER DOWN BREXIT

57
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,745
BAKE CONTROL PROPERLY OF OUR

58
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:50,379
LAWS.

59
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,314
WE WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO

60
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:53,582
THE EUROPEAN COURT.

61
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,384
WE WOULDN'T HAVE FULL BORDER

62
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:55,751
CONTROLS.

63
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:57,953
AND CRUCIALLY FOR AMERICA,

64
00:01:57,954 --> 00:02:01,156
YOU KNOW, MRS. MAY HAS BEEN

65
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:03,592
TELLING TRUMP ONCE WE ARE

66
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:05,594
DONE WITH THE BREXIT WE WILL

67
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:06,328
BE DEAL.

68
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,130
THIS DOCUMENT MEANS THAT'S

69
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,398
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

70
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,232
TRUMP'S INTERVENTION IS

71
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,200
BASED ON TWO THINGS.

72
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:12,735
BY THE WAY, I WASN'T

73
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:13,535
SURPRISED BY THIS BECAUSE I

74
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:15,771
KNOW HOW HE AND THOSE IN HIS

75
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:17,439
ADMINISTRATION FEEL ON THESE

76
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,773
ISSUES.

77
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:19,608
NUMBER ONE, TRUMP BELIEVES

78
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,209
IN BREXIT.

79
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,578
HE BELIEVES IN A WORLD OF

80
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,479
DEMOCRATIC NATION STATES

81
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,314
COOPERATING WITH EACH OTHER.

82
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:26,749
NOT GLOBALIST STRUCTURES

83
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,150
LIKE THE EUROPEAN UNION.

84
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,386
AND NUMBER TWO, I THINK HE

85
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:31,787
FEELS THAT THE U.S.

86
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:32,788
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY

87
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,190
BADLY LET DOWN.

88
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,492
STEVE: WELL, YOU SUPPORTED

89
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:36,825
BREXIT.

90
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,927
DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTED

91
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:39,261
BREXIT.

92
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,295
THERESA MAY DID NOT SUPPORT

93
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:43,298
BREXIT AND NOW SHE HAS ON

94
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,633
HER HANDS TRYING TO FIGURE

95
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:45,567
OUT HOW TO DO IT.

96
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:46,635
DO YOU THINK HER TIME IS

97
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:49,438
LIMITED NOW AT 10 DOWNING

98
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:49,772
STREET.

99
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,340
IS THE METER RUNNING AND

100
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:52,941
MAYBE BORIS JOHNSON IS IN

101
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:53,242
NEXT?

102
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,309
>> DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING, TO

103
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,744
PUT THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE

104
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:03,819
TO DO THESE THINGS, YOU HAVE

105
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,354
TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN IT.

106
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:06,522
AND THERESA MAY AS YOU POINT

107
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:08,157
OUT WAS A REMAINER.

108
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:09,925
LET'S BE FRANK, SHE'S NOT UP

109
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:10,392
TO THE JOB.

110
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:11,794
IF SHE STAYS AS PRIME

111
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:12,561
MINISTER, WE ARE NOT GOING

112
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:14,563
TO GET THE BREXIT WE VOTED

113
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:14,897
FOR.

114
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:16,799
THE SENSE OF BETRAYAL IN

115
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,267
THIS COUNTRY WILL BE HUGE.

116
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:20,302
AND I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT

117
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:23,272
YEAH.

118
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:25,174
THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED HER

119
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,108
IS BORIS.

120
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:28,510
YOU KNOW, AND BORIS DID AND

121
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:29,711
OKAY IT TOOK A LONG TIME,

122
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:31,246
BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE

123
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:36,218
LINE, BORIS DID BACK BREXIT.

124
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,553
BRIAN: NIGEL, A COUPLE OF

125
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:37,886
THINGS.

126
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,721
IT SEEMS BEHIND THE SCENES

127
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:41,223
THE PRESIDENT DID BACK THE

128
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:42,224
PRESIDENT BEHIND CLOSED

129
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,292
DOORS AT THE NATO SUMMIT.

130
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,827
THEY DO SEEM TO BE BUILDING

131
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:45,360
A PERSONAL BOND.

132
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,862
WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN THIS

133
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:48,297
STORY BROKE, DO YOU THINK,

134
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:48,997
DURING DINNER YESTERDAY?

135
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:50,933
>> I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE IT.

136
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:53,302
I MEAN, THE SCENE, YOU KNOW,

137
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:55,237
THE PALACE, THE BIRTHPLACE

138
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:56,305
OF WINSTON CHURCHILL.

139
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:57,406
WE HAD THE BIG MILITARY

140
00:03:57,407 --> 00:03:58,540
BANDS ON PARADE.

141
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,809
THE WEATHER WAS BEAUTIFUL.

142
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,877
THERESA MAY WAS IN HER

143
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:02,778
EVENING DRESS.

144
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,180
MET THE PRESIDENT AND I

145
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:08,150
CAN'T IMAGINE AS COFFEE WAS

146
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:09,852
SERVED SOMEBODY WHISPERING

147
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,920
IN THERESA MAY'S EAR PRIME

148
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,654
MINISTER THERE IS SOMETHING

149
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:13,856
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IT MUST

150
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:16,258
HAVE BEEN A VERY AWKWARD

151
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:16,658
MOMENT.

152
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:17,259
STEVE: I DON'T THINK YOU

153
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,960
WANT TO READ THE PAPER IN

154
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:18,393
THE MORNING.

155
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:19,661
>> I WOULD LOVE TO BE A FLY

156
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,761
ON THE WALL RIGHT NOW AT THE

157
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:23,365
PRIME MINISTER'S COUNTRY

158
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:23,799
RESIDENCE.

159
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:27,536
PROTESTING OUR PRESIDENT

160
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,171
WHEN THEY GIVE PRESIDENT

161
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:31,607
ERDOGAN OF TURKEY A PASS WHO

162
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:34,943
THAT COUNTRY.

163
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:38,614
THEY ARE UPSET AT OUR

164
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:39,381
PRESIDENT.

165
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:41,583
>> LOOK, WE HAVE THE CHINESE

166
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:42,718
PREMIER AND SAUDI ARABIA

167
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,524
AND WE GAVE HIM A STATE

168
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:49,825
VISIT AND THERE WERE HARDLY

169
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,193
ANY PROTESTS AT ALL.

170
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:52,194
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

171
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:54,596
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS THE

172
00:04:54,597 --> 00:04:56,999
LIBERAL LEFT PRESS DEMONIZE

173
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:00,202
UNFORTUNATELY, QUITE A FEW

174
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:01,537
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT I HAVE

175
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,539
TO SAY PROTEST IS FINE IN A

176
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,906
DEMOCRACY.

177
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:06,475
BUT TO BE FLYING THIS BLIMP,

178
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:08,377
THIS KITE OF DONALD TRUMP

179
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:12,781
OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT HOW SADIQ

180
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:15,684
IS HN

181
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:17,753
IS HE

182
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:17,786
SA HE

183
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:17,819
SADIE

184
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,688
SADIQKHAN COULD V.A. LOUED IT I

185
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,123
WILL NEVER KNOW.

186
00:05:21,124 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M ASHAMED OF THAT TODAY.
