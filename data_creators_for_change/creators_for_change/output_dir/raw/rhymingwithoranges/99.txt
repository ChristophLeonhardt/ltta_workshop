13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,210
Thatcher was an incredibly divisive

14
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,880
figure she was renowned as being a

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,540
forceful leader a strong character<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

disastrous late 1970s when the UK was

renowned as being the sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> man of Europe</font>

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,789
but her policies were seen as extreme

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,890
and ruthless bringing great prosperity

23
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,920
to some and making lives much worse for

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,170
many others she decimated mining

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,020
communities in the north where yuppies

in the city became<font color="#E5E5E5"> super bitch it's</font>

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,659
to her death now there have been several

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,490
forms of protest organized around the

33
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,680
death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,180
one of those that has been more

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,520
extensively reported on is the facebook

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,830
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maggie's good riddance party which</font>

37
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,080
aims to line the streets along where

she's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be carried as she's taken</font>

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,310
to st. Paul's Cathedral and turn their

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,259
backs on her this protest has been

41
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,930
reported on in a few newspapers and

42
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,210
media outlets as having several thousand

43
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,299
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning on taking part but when</font>

44
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at the facebook group itself</font>

45
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,360
there's only about 300 people who are

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
confirmed as going and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,799
accurate confirmed attendance can be on

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook not very much so the chances of</font>

49
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,200
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook group and this protest</font>

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
being significant in any way are

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,740
probably quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> slipped another more</font>

52
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,840
prominent campaign that has been getting

53
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">a significant amount of attention has</font>

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,640
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attempts to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get this song</font>

55
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,490
to number one sadly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it only got</font>

56
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,530
two number two and the BBC decided to

57
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,810
only play five seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the clip on</font>

58
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,640
their radio<font color="#E5E5E5"> one chart show out of</font>

59
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">respect for the family whilst also</font>

60
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,450
compromising with the protesters

61
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,580
interestingly a direct counterpoint to

62
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,470
this protest which was a song by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

63
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,360
sensibles called I love Margaret

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,730
Thatcher which got it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and number 35 was</font>

65
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,590
played in full so what do you guys think

66
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,870
of this specific decision was the BBC

67
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,390
right to only play a clip of the ding

68
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,550
dong the witch is dead<font color="#E5E5E5"> song should they</font>

69
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,160
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact not played it at all let me</font>

70
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,630
know in the comments what you think most

71
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,980
people that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in contact with</font>

72
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">have mentioned that we should respect</font>

73
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,090
the traditions of freedom of speech that

74
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,980
we have in this country that the song

75
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,780
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protest should be allowed to go</font>

76
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,840
ahead however<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are in very bad</font>

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,550
taste and that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something quite</font>

78
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,770
undignified about dancing on a dead

79
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,540
woman's grave I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

80
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,010
thought of this on Twitter and most of

81
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,890
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to agree with this stands but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Ali specifically asked me to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

83
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,660
explain the reasoning behind these

84
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,820
protests that could be interpreted is

85
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,860
quite disrespectful and so in order for

86
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,690
me to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that here's a quote</font>

87
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,810
from one of the protesters who has been

88
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to get ding dong the witch is</font>

89
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,440
dead<font color="#E5E5E5"> too number one at the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

90
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,850
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a voice</font>

91
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,010
that song must have hit a nerve because

92
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,140
people didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a voice they have a</font>

93
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,090
voice now number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one in Scotland's</font>

94
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,880
number one in Wales not all but most of

95
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,020
the coverage and the commentary

96
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,940
surrounding Thatcher's death has been

97
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,450
incredibly respectful and reflective but

98
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,340
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still a large number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

99
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,160
who are angry and bitter about the

100
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,620
policies that her government introduced

101
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,780
that in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases destroyed their</font>

102
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,940
culture and their livelihoods if the

103
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,950
figure that represented<font color="#CCCCCC"> the destruction</font>

their greatness then would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you too not</font>

107
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,790
also want the other side of the argument

108
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,330
to be heard this is what the turn your

109

represented what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think of these</font>

114
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,299
protests are they childish or are they a

115
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,220
necessary counterpoint to the

116
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tina phrase that has been afforded</font>

117
