tonight<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what they did in the first</font>

20
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,910

player<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't turn up again like he</font>

the score line<font color="#E5E5E5"> three nil is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a fair</font>

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,369
reflection of the game<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dirty game</font>

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,770
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say a very very a very rough</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I mean at times it was it was a</font>

39
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit too much that he was allowing</font>

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,460
through the game and you know the only

<font color="#E5E5E5">ones that are really hurt Argentina and</font>

43
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,439
that's completely down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own</font>

44
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,899
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much all the talk</font>

45
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,820
coming into this game was<font color="#E5E5E5"> their margin</font>

horrific<font color="#E5E5E5"> fashion let's just look at the</font>

opening goal and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goalkeeper of</font>

50

Argentina really<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought to blame this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

51
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:10,810
what

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,310
did all<font color="#E5E5E5"> day they put pressure on it</font>

53
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">everywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they must play from</font>

the back I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> auntie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rabbit the way that he</font>

finished that is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that was</font>

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,030
beautiful absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> my god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that ball</font>

59
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,099
even even when the ball<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

60
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,560
goalkeeper made the mistake that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,480
a goal that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a certainty it</font>

62
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,590
goes up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the air</font>

63
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,110
that gives defenders time to come back

64
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">it gives a goalkeeper time to recuperate</font>

65
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and go back in the goal to do what he</font>

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,390
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tell you I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you this right</font>

67
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I was surprised he did it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of players would have taken it down and</font>

69
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,930
tried to beat the goalkeeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean he</font>

70
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,640
smashed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the top corner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what a</font>

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">he showed his eyes I've never seen that</font>

79
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,310
with a coach before anyway hey I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

80
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,680
he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to put on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grass grass</font>

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,670

82
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,030
but don't take the one guy who will give

83
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,609
you a goal out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nothing don't take him</font>

84
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,069
off and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> where is that player Aquarius</font>

85
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,989
the only guy who's scored<font color="#CCCCCC"> frog and</font>

86
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,170
Argentina so far he will find a goal I

87
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Guerra always scores and for him</font>

88
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,459
there's no such thing as being<font color="#E5E5E5"> in form</font>

89
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of form he's a bouncer he's someone</font>

90
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,060
who who finds a chance and he scores

91
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">from him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so why take him off that that</font>

92
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,010
was

93
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,230
I was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad as taking</font>

off his shirt<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was some spectacle</font>

95
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,660
now if there was some<font color="#E5E5E5"> element of</font>

96
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-harm about that first goal</font>

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,978
could score from here but what dynamite

102
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,460
didn't that right foot<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big players</font>

said the Barcelona player also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

112
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,930
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best midfield players in the</font>

world he's turned up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn and so</font>

114
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,130
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contrast you know what</font>

115
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Argentina didn't have their players</font>

116
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,240
playing or performing as you expect them

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,690
to do that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Croatia wins today</font>

118
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,550
because the players all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the players</font>

119
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,740
perform fantastically well<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when you</font>

120
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,530
need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> your big player steps up</font>

121
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,660
to the plate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they deliver and ragga</font>

122
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">touch and market it then I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

123
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,450
see that racket<font color="#CCCCCC"> head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goal it was right</font>

124
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,030
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the game I have to say and</font>

125
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well we don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but</font>

126
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,350
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to put it at this point</font>

127
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">because at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> halftime we talked about that</font>

128
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,590
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite an ill-tempered game</font>

129
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tension</font>

130
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,880
between the teams and not many yellow

cards<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the first art</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then they</font>

132
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,030
started developers as Argentina became

133
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">more frustrated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we saw some</font>

134
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,310
pretty vindictive<font color="#CCCCCC"> tackles going I think</font>

135
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,780
Otto Mendes should not have had a yellow
