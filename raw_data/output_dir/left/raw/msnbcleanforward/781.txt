00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,543
today with TD Ameritrade.

2
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:11,645
>>> WELCOME BACK.

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,848
>>> WELCOME BACK. WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRESIDENT’S

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,051
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRESIDENT’S POLITICAL STANDING, THE STORY SO

5
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,586
POLITICAL STANDING, THE STORY SO FAR HAS BEEN THAT PRESIDENT

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,555
FAR HAS BEEN THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP’S APPROVAL RATING IS

7
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:21,922
TRUMP’S APPROVAL RATING IS DROPPING.

8
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:22,756
DROPPING. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,191
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS THE AVERAGE OF EVERY

10
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,358
THIS IS THE AVERAGE OF EVERY POLL OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.

11
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:28,328
POLL OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. HIS APPROVAL RATING SITTING AT

12
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:28,661
HIS APPROVAL RATING SITTING AT 40.9%.

13
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:29,863
40.9%. WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER,

14
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,364
WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER, IF YOU WENT BACK TO LATE AUGUST,

15
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,099
IF YOU WENT BACK TO LATE AUGUST, JUST A LITTLE LESS THAN A MONTH

16
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,935
JUST A LITTLE LESS THAN A MONTH AGO, HIS AVERAGE BACK THEN WAS

17
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:37,170
AGO, HIS AVERAGE BACK THEN WAS GETTING CLOSER TO THE MID 40s.

18
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:38,838
GETTING CLOSER TO THE MID 40s. DOWN 2.5 POINTS.

19
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,640
DOWN 2.5 POINTS. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT DROP,

20
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:41,775
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT DROP, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

21
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,678
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, WHOSE NUMBERS HAVE

22
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,713
DONALD TRUMP, WHOSE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN WITHIN SUCH A NARROW RANGE.

23
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:48,448
BEEN WITHIN SUCH A NARROW RANGE. THAT’S A CRITICAL NUMBER WHEN IT

24
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,783
THAT’S A CRITICAL NUMBER WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRATS AND THEIR

25
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,852
COMES TO DEMOCRATS AND THEIR HOPES FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

26
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,387
HOPES FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. JOINING ME TO TALK ABOUT THE

27
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,822
JOINING ME TO TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT’S POLITICAL STANDINGS,

28
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,490
PRESIDENT’S POLITICAL STANDINGS, AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE

29
00:00:56,524 --> 00:01:00,661
AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A BLUE WAVE.

30
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,498
POSSIBILITY OF A BLUE WAVE. MONMOUTH HAS HAD SOME OF THE

31
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,966
MONMOUTH HAS HAD SOME OF THE BEST POLLS WE HAVE SEEN THIS

32
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:09,770
BEST POLLS WE HAVE SEEN THIS CYCLE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS.

33
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,606
CYCLE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. THE PRESIDENT’S APPROVAL RATING,

34
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,908
THE PRESIDENT’S APPROVAL RATING, DOWN THE 2 1/2 POINTS.

35
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:15,742
DOWN THE 2 1/2 POINTS. THAT’S SIGNIFICANT.

36
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:18,512
THAT’S SIGNIFICANT. WHAT HAS BEEN DRIVING THAT?

37
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:21,915
WHAT HAS BEEN DRIVING THAT? >> IT’S BEEN ABSOLUTELY STABLE

38
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:22,983
>> IT’S BEEN ABSOLUTELY STABLE UNTIL THREE WEEKS AGO.

39
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,218
UNTIL THREE WEEKS AGO. WE HAVE SEEN THESE CYCLE WHERE

40
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,220
WE HAVE SEEN THESE CYCLE WHERE IS IT’S GONE DOWN AND COME BACK

41
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:26,487
IS IT’S GONE DOWN AND COME BACK UP.

42
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,322
UP. SO WE’RE NOT SURE IF IT WILL

43
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,456
SO WE’RE NOT SURE IF IT WILL COME BACK UP BEFORE THE

44
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:29,823
COME BACK UP BEFORE THE ELECTION.

45
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:30,957
ELECTION. BUT IT HAPPENS WHEN THERE’S A

46
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:33,794
BUT IT HAPPENS WHEN THERE’S A LOT OF TWEETING ACTIVITY GOING

47
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:37,131
LOT OF TWEETING ACTIVITY GOING ON, WHEN HE OBVIOUSLY IS UPSET

48
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:38,432
ON, WHEN HE OBVIOUSLY IS UPSET WITH THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

49
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,934
WITH THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. I THINK THAT’S GOING TO

50
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,235
I THINK THAT’S GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO HIM TWEETING A LOT

51
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,069
CONTRIBUTE TO HIM TWEETING A LOT MORE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WILL

52
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:44,338
MORE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WILL BE RELEASED.

53
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,240
BE RELEASED. AND THE PUBLIC DOESN’T LIKE

54
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:46,640
AND THE PUBLIC DOESN’T LIKE THAT.

55
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:48,408
THAT. THAT’S WHEN HIS NUMBERS GO DOWN.

56
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,544
THAT’S WHEN HIS NUMBERS GO DOWN. IT’S JUST TOO MUCH CHAOS.

57
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,780
IT’S JUST TOO MUCH CHAOS. >> SO IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT

58
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:54,749
>> SO IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THE PEOPLE SAY THE McCAIN

59
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:55,917
THE PEOPLE SAY THE McCAIN FUNERAL, AND I THINK THAT WAS

60
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:00,221
FUNERAL, AND I THINK THAT WAS PART OF IT, BUT MANAFORT, THE

61
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:02,423
PART OF IT, BUT MANAFORT, THE CONVICTION AT THE END OF THE

62
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:03,658
CONVICTION AT THE END OF THE AUGUST, WHICH HAPPENED AT THE

63
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,359
AUGUST, WHICH HAPPENED AT THE SAME DEAL AS THE MICHAEL COHEN

64
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:08,295
SAME DEAL AS THE MICHAEL COHEN PLEA DEAL, WHICH ROLLS INTO THIS

65
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,864
PLEA DEAL, WHICH ROLLS INTO THIS SECOND DEAL WITH PAUL MANAFORT,

66
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,899
SECOND DEAL WITH PAUL MANAFORT, WHICH ROLLS INTO FISA.

67
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,768
WHICH ROLLS INTO FISA. THERE’S THIS ESCALATED LEVEL OF

68
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:14,068
THERE’S THIS ESCALATED LEVEL OF CHAOS.

69
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,270
CHAOS. >> THE PUBLIC LIKES SHAKING UP

70
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:18,205
>> THE PUBLIC LIKES SHAKING UP OF WASHINGTON, BUT IT’S JUST

71
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,873
OF WASHINGTON, BUT IT’S JUST WHEN THAT CHAOS GETS OUT OF

72
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:22,376
WHEN THAT CHAOS GETS OUT OF CONTROL.

73
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,911
CONTROL. THAT’S WHAT WAS GOING ON IN LATE

74
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:26,581
THAT’S WHAT WAS GOING ON IN LATE DECEMBER LAST YEAR WHEN HIS

75
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:28,349
DECEMBER LAST YEAR WHEN HIS NUMBERS JUMPED BACK UP WHEN WE

76
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,650
NUMBERS JUMPED BACK UP WHEN WE GOT THE TAX REFORM.

77
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,985
GOT THE TAX REFORM. THE NUMBERS STABILIZE.

78
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:32,353
THE NUMBERS STABILIZE. NOW THEY’RE GOING DOWN AGAIN FOR

79
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:33,354
NOW THEY’RE GOING DOWN AGAIN FOR THE SAME REASON.

80
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:35,590
THE SAME REASON. SO I’M WONDERING IF THE BREAKING

81
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:36,891
SO I’M WONDERING IF THE BREAKING NEWS CONTRIBUTES TO THAT GOING

82
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:37,992
NEWS CONTRIBUTES TO THAT GOING DOWN FURTHER.

83
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:39,427
DOWN FURTHER. THAT’S NOT WHERE TRUMP NEEDS TO

84
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:39,694
THAT’S NOT WHERE TRUMP NEEDS TO BE.

85
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,263
BE. THE MIDTERM RACES THAT WE’RE

86
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:44,199
THE MIDTERM RACES THAT WE’RE SEEING RIGHT NOW ARE HINGING

87
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
SEEING RIGHT NOW ARE HINGING ALMOST TOTALLY ON DONALD TRUMP

88
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,401
ALMOST TOTALLY ON DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW.

89
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:47,769
RIGHT NOW. >> AND THAT’S INTERESTING,

90
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:48,970
>> AND THAT’S INTERESTING, BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK TO

91
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,104
BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK TO REPUBLICANS, AND THEY’RE TRYING

92
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,340
REPUBLICANS, AND THEY’RE TRYING TO HANG ON TO THE HOUSE, THEY

93
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:55,009
TO HANG ON TO THE HOUSE, THEY CAN’T GIVE UP 23 OR MORE SEATS.

94
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:56,978
CAN’T GIVE UP 23 OR MORE SEATS. THEY SAY THE CLOSER TO JUST GET

95
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:59,514
THEY SAY THE CLOSER TO JUST GET TRUMP TO THE MID 40s, THE BETTER

96
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:00,715
TRUMP TO THE MID 40s, THE BETTER THEIR CHANCES ARE.

97
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,417
THEIR CHANCES ARE. >> THERE’S A WHOLE SLEW OF HOUSE

98
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:03,852
>> THERE’S A WHOLE SLEW OF HOUSE POLLS COMING OUT.

99
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:05,920
POLLS COMING OUT. ALL OF THEM SUGGEST WE HAVE A

100
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:08,423
ALL OF THEM SUGGEST WE HAVE A BLUE HIGH TIDE BUT NOT A BLUE

101
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:08,723
BLUE HIGH TIDE BUT NOT A BLUE WAVE.

102
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:09,958
WAVE. DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO PICK UP

103
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:12,093
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO PICK UP 10, 15 SEATS, BUT THE QUESTION

104
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:15,630
10, 15 SEATS, BUT THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY GOING TO GET THOSE

105
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:16,865
IS ARE THEY GOING TO GET THOSE 40 SEATS AND A TSUNAMI?

106
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,433
40 SEATS AND A TSUNAMI? WE’RE NOT THERE.

107
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:19,534
WE’RE NOT THERE. AND DONALD TRUMP BEING STABLE IS

108
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:20,902
AND DONALD TRUMP BEING STABLE IS GOING TO HELP REPUBLICANS.

109
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:22,337
GOING TO HELP REPUBLICANS. RIGHT NOW THE INDICATION IS THAT

110
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:23,905
RIGHT NOW THE INDICATION IS THAT THEY’RE GOING TO CONTINUE INTO

111
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
THEY’RE GOING TO CONTINUE INTO THIS SPIRAL OF CHAOS.

112
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,943
THIS SPIRAL OF CHAOS. >> IS THERE A MOMENT, I GUESS

113
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,812
>> IS THERE A MOMENT, I GUESS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT’S

114
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:32,414
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT’S SELF-EVIDENT, BUT IS THERE A

115
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,115
SELF-EVIDENT, BUT IS THERE A MOMENT WHEN ALL OF THIS DOES

116
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:33,849
MOMENT WHEN ALL OF THIS DOES LOCK IN FOR VOTERS?

117
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,051
LOCK IN FOR VOTERS? >> PROBABLY ABOUT TWO WEEKS AWAY

118
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:37,352
>> PROBABLY ABOUT TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM WHERE THIS TREND IS

119
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:38,653
FROM WHERE THIS TREND IS GOING -- WE’LL KNOW WHERE THIS

120
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:39,587
GOING -- WE’LL KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.

121
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:41,056
IS GOING. BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN’T REEL IT

122
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,356
BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN’T REEL IT BACK.

123
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:43,058
BACK. IF YOU’RE THE PRESIDENT, YOU

124
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,826
IF YOU’RE THE PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME BIT OF

125
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,327
HAVE TO HAVE SOME BIT OF ACCOMPLISHMENT.

126
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:47,262
ACCOMPLISHMENT. HE’S GOING TO HAVE TO DO

127
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:48,063
HE’S GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THE

128
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:50,098
SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THE QUESTION, WHICH IS NOT OUT OF

129
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,533
QUESTION, WHICH IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR DONALD TRUMP.

130
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,769
THE QUESTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. >> IN 2016, THAT ACCESS

131
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,870
>> IN 2016, THAT ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPE COMES OUT BEFORE

132
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:55,871
HOLLYWOOD TAPE COMES OUT BEFORE THE ELECTION.

133
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:57,573
THE ELECTION. HIS WHOLE PARTY IS TELLING HIM

134
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:59,241
HIS WHOLE PARTY IS TELLING HIM TO GET OUT OF THE RACE.

135
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,777
TO GET OUT OF THE RACE. HE DID NARROWLY EKE OUT A

136
00:04:01,778 --> 00:04:02,077
HE DID NARROWLY EKE OUT A VICTORY.

137
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:03,378
VICTORY. HE DID RECOVER ENOUGH TO WIN AT

138
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,913
HE DID RECOVER ENOUGH TO WIN AT THE END OF THAT.

139
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,382
THE END OF THAT. >> WELL, HERE WE’RE DEALING WITH

140
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,783
>> WELL, HERE WE’RE DEALING WITH AT LEAST 40 OR 50 DIFFERENT

141
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:10,919
AT LEAST 40 OR 50 DIFFERENT SENATE AND HOUSE SEATS THAT ARE

142
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:11,353
SENATE AND HOUSE SEATS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE.

143
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:14,089
COMPETITIVE. AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU HAVE

144
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:16,024
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU HAVE THE QUALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL

145
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,092
THE QUALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATES THAT ARE GOING TO

146
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:17,626
CANDIDATES THAT ARE GOING TO COME INTO PLAY.

147
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,995
COME INTO PLAY. SO WE CAN’T HAVE THAT ONE SINGLE

148
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,200
SO WE CAN’T HAVE THAT ONE SINGLE THING LIKE THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD

149
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:28,103
THING LIKE THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPE THEN THE COMEY LETTER.

150
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:30,339
TAPE THEN THE COMEY LETTER. DONALD TRUMP IS THE LINCHPIN

151
00:04:30,373 --> 00:00:00,000
DONALD TRUMP IS THE LINCHPIN BETWEEN WHETHER REPUBLICANS HOLD
