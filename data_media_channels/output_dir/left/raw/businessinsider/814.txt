00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,170
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 52 seconds</font>

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,330
my biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> cookie trick when I'm running</font>

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I smile frequently during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,039
races which seems strange<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're</font>

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,449
in a lot of pain and if you're running

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,359
fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to be hurting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I find</font>

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when I smile I run</font>

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,729
faster maybe the first time that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> smile</font>

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,770
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> your race was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in high school when</font>

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was pouring pouring rain and I</font>

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,920
thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just just gonna be the</font>

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,739
worst race ever decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to laugh at the</font>

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,440
experience sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and I smiled and I</font>

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">ran my best race at that point ever when</font>

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,629
I refigured that trick out in college<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

18
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:53,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">seem to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot better kind of</font>

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,219
instantly it's all correlation obviously

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,530
but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started smiling I started</font>

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,690
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot faster it doesn't have to</font>

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,780
be natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily you can just</font>

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,330
think to smile<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of a sudden</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

24
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">body</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll feel more relaxed you'll be</font>

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,740
less stressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you'll feel happier</font>

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,600
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you have more energy even if</font>

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,070
you're in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pain and you're</font>

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's really</font>

29

helpful to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have some kind of a</font>

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,200
mental<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy and something to focus</font>

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">work for a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people but just</font>

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,180
