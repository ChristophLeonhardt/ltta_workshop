ladies what a pleasure to have you join us live from North Carolina via Skype I don't know if I need you know a police officer standing by me to protect me or Mark Zuckerberg permission but I guess I'm doing something unsafe by even talking with you well according to Facebook yes because we are now deemed unsafe to the community see what Facebook didn't realize that the brand and the content that we put out we are our brand that's right we are human beings to black chicks down with politics we love our president we love our country were very patriotic so we don't understand how did they come to the conclusion that we are a danger we are a danger to our community because that's basically what they're saying and they did not specify the Facebook community so we was taken aback by it so when we look at all of this to us this feel like censorship discrimination a violation of our civil rights and defamation of our characters and our brand yeah you know you tainted our brand by stereotyping and putting this stigma on us yeah we are unsafe to the community so that's a problem yeah well I I've enjoyed watching you I first saw you online and then I saw you on TV at live events your fan favorites and your family friendly I mean you say tough things politically but you're I've never heard you curse I've never heard you say anything remotely threatening I like your stomach that's a personal choice of other people don't like the style they can click away did they ever give you an example like an evidence of something that they said you've done wrong was there a specific incident they referred to or was it just a general political disagreement did Facebook ever complain about something in particular no no warnings nothing no nothing we just woke up one morning it was back in September of 2017 our page was like it was like the content wouldn't come up for several hours and then once the once they fix that and call them self fixing that BAM we saw our numbers plummeted right that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
