00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> becoming increasingly aware of how</font>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,959
my behavior is aligned with stereotypes

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,910
of grown-ups for instance it's raining

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,919

11
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,560

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,939
