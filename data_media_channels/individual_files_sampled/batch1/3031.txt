Rowdy gentleman is a clothing brand the idea behind it was to create a brand that captured a lot of the same vibes as TFM but put it under a brand name that was a little broader that wasn't so attorneys already specific it's a funny slogan it's patriotic the modern college student they love patriotism I think it was submitted as a one-liner to TFM I think somebody said America : back to back World War champs and we were all dying laughing at it we put it on a tank top I believe was the first thing we put it on and it just went absolutely nuts that one design took peril side the business to a new level I went from fulfilling 15 to 25 words a day to 200 to 400 words a day it went crazy we now have several iterations of that design with that that was definitely one of the designs that really took off and kind of got word out about the products that were though that we were doing another popular design was the reagan-bush 84 shirt it's nostalgic it's patriotic its conservative and says Bush on the shirt to the people to visit our website just love that stuff
