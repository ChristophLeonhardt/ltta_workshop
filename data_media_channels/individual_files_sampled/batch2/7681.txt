the fact that better or ork has a good chance at beating him in the Senate race and he is now turning to some tricks in order to raise money for his campaign now keep in mind that better o'rourke refuses to take corporate PAC money he is accepting donations from small donors you know people that he wishes to represent and so he's actually raised about as much money as Ted Cruz has and Ted Cruz relies specifically on these big donors and super PACs and all that now with that said Cruz is trying to figure out ways to raise even more money and he's doing it in an insanely deceptive way he's sending out letters that look like their official summonses okay this isn't bad she's such a bad guy okay so let me give you the details the brown envelopes read summons and clothes open immediately in large black letters and have a return address of official county summons okay it's actually worse than that this is official travis county summons there's no way that you would know that that wasn't from travis county because that's where it says it's from it doesn't say anything on the front of the of the piece of mail that says ted cruz at least in the return section here so if you see in the kind of part that this almost covered up because the paper is shifting within there from senator ted cruz but the giant letters that you that everybody notices is summons and closed-open immediately well where is it from what do i do i always go to the thing that's printed on the upper left corner says officials travis county summons voter enrollment campaign division okay then it says Ted Cruz for Senate 2018 it's like the the last line so if you're paying really careful attention you'll see the last line and you might see the little note in the corner but the overall things this summons and it looks like it's official it's obviously meant to be deceptive okay so it is meant to be deceptive and some of the voters in Texas are upset about this because they have elderly family members or or maybe not even elderly family members in some case who have been tricked by this so one person who spoke out is Texas resident Sean Owen and here's what he said via Twitter receive this for my 88 year old grandma says it's a summons from Travis County but is actually asking for money for Ted Cruz did your campaign this is this even legal shame on you that's one more better or work voter so Sean made it clear that he's not gonna be voting for Ted Cruz and he also spoke to the press about this and Owens said the following I am used to ignoring junk mail with urgent or final notice written on it but this fooled even me for a moment as it plainly wants us to think it's from our county government when it isn't it made me mad because my grandmother suffered from some dementia and could easily have followed the urgent request inside to send money it's unbelievable so because this clown can't get anyone but giant corporations and billionaires to give him money whereas better or Roark has raised over twenty three million dollars without taking any corporate money and any PAC money it's unbelievable I don't even know how he's doing it it's i outside of Bernie Sanders I'm not sure I've ever seen a campaign this successful raising small dollar donations from real people so Ted Cruz being the comical corporate robot that he is can't get any real people to give him money so he has to try to trick them into it summers enclosed open immediately you owe money and then if you actually fall for it you're actually sending money to Ted Cruz hey Ted if you're so proud and you think that you represent Texas principles why doesn't let us say from Ted Cruz open to help Ted Cruz no because you're trying to trick people so Craig Murphy is a Republican operative he's a strategist and of course he thinks okay because they do this all the time he says these appeals are self-healing what does that mean self-healing he explains it people don't like it they don't give it's the most normal thing in politics it's the attention getter no no but the problem isn't whether people like it or not I mean people who caught on to this trick don't like it obviously but the problem is some people might not catch on and realize that this isn't an official summons from the county and they might give money they might be fooled into giving a candidate that they may not even support money Craig you perennial liar and and that's exactly what Republicans do because they are not popular you're if you sent a notice that said as I've been telling you this is for Ted Cruz then it's self-healing you like Ted Cruz to give money to Ted Cruz nobody objects to that I wish Ted Cruz would only take small dollar donations like better or workers doing and then I actually would trust them to be an honest conservative I might not agree with this conservative principles but I know that he's working for conservatives and not for donors but he but he's a liar just like you Craig and so he says well I gotta trick people I had to pretend that it's the son it's from the government and the day old money otherwise they'll never set me up money have you seen me I'm Ted Cruz so at least have the decency to be honest about it of course we're Republicans all we ever do is trick people if the Republicans are honest in their ads about their actual policy proposals you think that ever win any elections hey we gave tax two trillion dollars of tax cuts for the rich and soon we'll be cutting your Social Security and Medicare that is their actual proposals you put that in an ad in every Republican in the country loses so that their whole party is based on lies right so to that point some of you might be wondering why are there hunks of meat in this master graphic behind you right well there's another trick that Ted Cruz is trying to play that is hilarious so he was at a campaign event where Peter was protesting him and he decided to use that situation against Barrow or Roarke by accusing him of trying to ban barbecue in the state of Texas Oh because homeboy can't figure out how to attack beto on the actual idea so he makes up nonsense about barbecue okay so let's go to that graphic he said the following protested our Town Hall yesterday PETA protested our town yesterday handing out barbecued tofu we were glad to welcome them but it illustrates the stakes of the election if better wins barbecue will be illegal with emojis because that's exactly what you want to see from a grown man who is a u.s. senator yeah so look if he attacked Peter okay that's normal politics all these liberals they hate steaks and barbecue weird texture for barbecue but of course you couldn't leave it alone somehow better or ork is going to ban barbecue okay he put the crying emojis I guess that means he's joking right mm-hmm not sure that's clear but he did it again yeah and when asked about it he's like oh yeah better O'Rourke's gonna ban barbecues in Texas she's so pathetic but you know what sad first of all you're right sad baby okay lyin Ted okay that's what Trump used to golf I guess he was right about one thing okay uh but it does show you he's in a world of hurt I mean you're not going to desperate measures like hey better work my ban barbecue okay he's worried that you know pigs will be banned and then Ted Cruz will have to leave the state oh okay by the way he went on to add the second time that he talked about our barbecue he said quote this is quote Cruz you want to talk about an issue to mobilize the people I'm telling it everybody and so that's his way of saying remember black people like barbecue - oh god you're the worst I didn't pick up on that yes I'm talking about everybody why people like barbecue Latinos black people like barbecue Beto hates barbecue is never said any such thing this is an old trick by Cruz in 2016 he also sent Iowa voters before the caucus a note that said voting violation and expel letters and he explained that you had to go and vote for him in the caucuses to improve your score otherwise your bad score would be sent to your neighbors oh my god such a bad guy but to be fair to Ted Cruz if Ted told the truth about his record who the hell would vote for him yeah every time we do a story about Ted Cruz I always think about the 2016 election there were many embarrassing moments for him back then and today but that one time when he was speaking there was a weird white thing on his lower lip like it just it's such a ted cruz thing to happen floating away on their face in a national moment it would be Ted Cruz and well you know my favorite of course the old picture of Ted phone-banking for Donald Trump after he was unmanned sad do they do that in Texas that like what you see click this
