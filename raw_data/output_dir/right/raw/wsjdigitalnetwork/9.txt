1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,780
The automation

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,409
Revolution is beginning to come into fashion

3
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:10,829
The clothing industry is among the latest economic sectors to be making the leap

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:14,939
Which is ironic because it was among the first to be mechanized

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,340
today they still require

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,289
Skilled human hands to guide and handle the materials

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,639
In this episode of moving upstream our third on the robotics revolution

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:34,979
Looking at what these new cutting-edge technologies can do and the impact they're beginning to have on the developing world

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,390
Across the globe 60 million people toil each day in the garment industry

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,929
It offers the poor poor women in particular job opportunities they might not have otherwise

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,679
The journal visited garment factories in Bangladesh

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,330
They employ more than three and a half million people most working for a little more than the country's minimum wage

13
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,868
around sixty four US dollars a month and

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,759
sometimes toiling under conditions that endanger their lives

15
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,140
There has been another horrific incident at a garment factory in Bangladesh at least a hundred and twelve people died

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,419
hundreds of injured were rushed from the scene

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,899
Now a new threat is emerging to workers livelihoods

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,180
Machines that automate parts of the clothes making process

19
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,459
This german-made robot for example is knitting sweaters for brands like H&M and Zara

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,669
in January WS J's John amant visited garment factories in Bangladesh

21
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,459
I would visit factories in Dhaka

22
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,619
where workers would work manually to make sweaters while automated machines would also work to do the exact same thing and

23
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,989
It was quite clear that the workers were going to be replaced by these machines, and I would ask the workers

24
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:22,548
Are you afraid that your jobs would be taken away by the automated machines, and they would say yes?

25
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:30,470
We're scared until recently machines lacked the versatility the dexterity to handle soft

26
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,009
materials, and that comes naturally to humans, but thanks to machine learning and other forms of AI

27
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,120
What you're seeing here?

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,390
May be just the tip of the needle

29
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,879
New types of machines capable of ever more complex tasks are on the way

30
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:57,229
Machines like these threatened to make the situation worse for a country in dire need of more jobs

31
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:06,200
Bangladesh according to the World Bank needs to add 2 million jobs a year to keep pace with its

32
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,110
expanding labor force, but the number of new jobs added by the garment rate has fallen to

33
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,000
60,000 a year

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,839
When you zoom out a bit you see a region bursting at the seams with people needing work

35
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,979
Close to a million individuals are projected to enter the workforce here every month for the next two decades

36
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,340
by one estimate if automation

37
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:37,578
Reaches its potential some countries could lose more than 80 percent of their garment textile and apparel

38
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,079
Manufacturing jobs, how worried are you for countries like Bangladesh? I'm very worried

39
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:48,739
It's given that their economy is dominated 85 percent by the garment industry Carrie Northland a professor at Brown University

40
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,650
teaches about the impact of

41
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,729
Globalization on women because women have these jobs and often are the sole breadwinners for their families the sole breadwinners, that's right

42
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:05,840
They've been able to lift their families out of the depths of poverty those low-skilled jobs may become extinct very soon

43
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,569
Erik Brynjolfsson who studies the economic impact of what he calls the second Machine Age

44
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,899
Thinks the only solution for these countries is

45
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,380
Education they're gonna have to leapfrog and get up to the level that Europe the United States

46
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,010
Japan and other advanced countries have and that's not an easy task

47
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,530
Technology can help there, too

48
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,820
We have online programs at MIT MIT before anything literally that's right a lot of these women have very basic

49
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:46,199
Basic reading basic math skills, so where will these women go will they have opportunities for retraining. This is the open question?

50
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:52,378
Fortunately for them societies that employ massive armies of sewers still have some time

51
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,258
Autonomous sewing machines aren't nearly as far along as say autonomous vehicles

52
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:08,129
On a recent trip to Japan we visited a company that's been taking intermediary steps in the autonomous direction

53
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:17,669
That's where we visited you hub a company that's been working for decades on the challenge of replacing sewing machines

54
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,309
with machines that do the show

55
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:29,669
This is akikusa Takagi the 77 year old founder and chairman of juha machine all wound up with on a night

56
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:35,158
So I thought what a nice so you know whatever. I next ride is so focus or you like yoga overnight?

57
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,949
euros machines automate some of the more time-consuming steps

58
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,409
You know they compute

59
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,409
You all suggested that we visit a place where we could see some of its machines in actual practice

60
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,560
They sent us to a prison

61
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,349
What kind of uniforms are they making here k mikanos a school jose sales at Nagasaki prison in Japan

62
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:24,419
euros machines help the inmates whose faces the prison authorities required us to blur meet their daily quotas and

63
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,019
How much training do you need to be able to use one of these?

64
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,019
They use this one for example to add pockets to uniforms a job that would otherwise take

65
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,840
Three people and a lot more time to complete

66
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,750
the inmates must produce at least

67
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:47,989
50 pairs of pants and coats or day you hose owner tells us his machines are used in China

68
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:54,979
Where labor costs are rising to help make clothes for Uniqlo, but the developing world hasn't been all that interested

69
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,859
He says because the price tag for them is so high

70
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:05,239
Cost is one reason why automation in the garment industry may take root first in the West

71
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:10,489
One US company called software is aiming to do something uooo has not

72
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,280
Removing almost entirely human involvement in the process of making to start with t-shirts

73
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,819
The company provided this footage of its prototype

74
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,780
sohbats

75
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,570
software touts that it's so bots and will bring garment production back to

76
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:31,909
America by the end of 2018 it plans to open a factory in Arkansas

77
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,440
capable of cranking out over a million t-shirts a year at

78
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,509
Prices the company says are on par with the lowest wage countries

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,440
So the day when sohbats from start to finish can produce articles of clothing appears to be not so far upstream

80
00:07:51,870 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think will these technologies have a dramatic impact on the US and on the developing world we'd love to hear your comments
