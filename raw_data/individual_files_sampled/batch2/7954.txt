kanye west stopped by TMZ and he said a number of controversial things one of them is that uh slavery he says quote is a choice we have a video from TMZ let's take a look right now you hear about slavery for 400 years for 400 years that's sound like a choice like he was there for 400 years and it's all y'all you know like it's like we're we're mentally in prison I like the word prison cuz slavery goes to to direct to the idea of blacks it's like slavery Holocaust Holocaust Jews slavery is blacks so prison is something that unites us is one race blacks and whites being one race that we're one we're with a human race okay so before I toss over to the panel I want to apply a little bit of more context because that was just Kanye West's quote he then served turns it over to the newsroom and TMZ and van Lathan who was a writer at TMZ responded and this is what he said he says you're entitled to believe whatever you want but there is fact and real-world real-life consequence behind everything you just said and while you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you've earned by being a genius the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives you have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice ending by saying that he was disappointed appalled and unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something that to me is not real so really powerful words this is going absolutely viral right now what was the response when you guys saw this I know this was sort of a breaking story that we got just before he went to tape what did you think I think Kanye's really trying to sell an album and I think that this is a social experiment I hope and he's trying to see if he can go as far as he can go and still get people to buy his albums and show people that he owns it I like I said last time and I got really angry about it and then I started thinking and reflecting and I'm like why is Kanye was does he matter in my everyday and he doesn't and he doesn't matter in the lives of all of the people who have to go to work and all of the people who are suffering the the effects the systemic oppression died been in place for hundreds of years which is not a figment of anybody's imagination and it was in a decision or choice it seems to me like it is Kanye's choice to be mentally imprisoned right now with this ideology that he's trying to drop on the young minds who are impressionable and listening to him but as far as being disappointed I mean we really hold him to a high standard and really keep giving him a mic and I just think that they need to cut Kanye's microphone off because like I said last time when Kanye tweeted a picture of his home and tweeted about his Tesla he is completely disconnected from the struggle that every single person on the planet who is working to live another day is he he is basking in his wealth and in his privilege and he is completely disconnected to the everyday experience that those of us who have to go to work and really live in reality so may they do you think that van Lathan's words really woke him up because it seemed like in that moment how incredibly bold that must have been to just stand up in this workroom and address Kanye West I was incredibly moved by van Latham statements because he was in a work space and he took it upon himself to intervene in this moment when the rest of the TMZ team was just listening to him without rebuke and so I really wanted to see that interaction after Kanye came up to him and and apologized but apologized and then what apologized that he felt hurt and that was it and I think this is I couldn't agree with you more I think this is a product also of our education system we focus and emphasize more on opinions over curious questions I mean what is he tweeting about in terms of history he in 400 years he's erasing all the slave rebellions he's erasing all the NAT Turner's he's erasing all the Harriet Tubman's he's erasing the white abolitionists that fought against slavery like John Brown and sacrificed their lives and then the the period afterwards that some historians call slavery by another name the convict leasing system the rise of the prison industrial complex the way that this encoded in our laws and how Jim Crow rises up as well so this man is just literally speaking from the hip and we are listening to him and I think that's absolutely the issue is when are we gonna say I don't want to give you the mic if folks can give him the mic and I know we're talking about him too but it's because his statements are so irresponsible they do have consequences and the right-wing the alt-right is gonna use it as fodder and it's gonna be such a devastating blow just for promotion I you know he's so big on on freethought it's been sort of his his main narrative these pushing right now you can't stifle my free throw this is just you know free thinking I love people who think freely but you have to recognize that this free thought is being used as basically just a pawn for a side that would serve to just further marginalize these communities and I don't understand how he was seeing that and how he's not being manipulated and now when you see Donald Trump calling Kanye West out at a rally you know as this you know he is the the spokesman for whatever cause how he's being a puppet but it's also it's contradictory is conflicting when he was trying to do his clothing line he was talking about how racism was marginalize it's just when it's convenient it's whatever is whatever the wind goes and everybody keeps falling for it he just talked about racism today he was talking about racism racism is a direct it is a is a result of slavery right so then if slavery doesn't exist why you talk why does racism exist when it pertains to you but not everybody yeah well two easy ways to follow
