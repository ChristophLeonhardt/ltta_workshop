so let me ask a question do you also that sinking suspicion that Hollywood has been just a bit anti white American recently well if you're not convinced by the Oscar nominated best film lineup look no further than the recent advertisement for the latest installment of the horror gore franchise the purge if you haven't seen it don't worry Forbes eloquently sums it up as such quote the general idea was that the purge night encouraged the right white American male citizens to declare war on those they deemed inferior by nature of gender race religion etc while encouraging the poor it'll wipe each other out unquote I'm not kidding and it gets worse I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood the creators of the purge pulled no punches in the way they meticulously advertised this movie even posting a 30 second advertisement during the State of the Union in the commercial there's a voiceover of a manly southern adult praising America and his traditions showing beautiful photos of white Americans farming playing baseball attending American rallies laughing together and then one specific shot in this all-white cast of a black man looking down at his son very worried and then back to a photo of a white dad and his son laughing looking hopeful and then the southern voice closes the commercial by saying dad I want to purge too unquote and if that didn't seem on the nose and specific enough for you check out the poster for the film a red baseball cap with the white lettering the first purge also it'll be released on July 4th our day of Independence and here's the thing just imagine the chaos if we reverse this for a second keep in mind this isn't just people liking the president this is an entire group of people at Forbes described as being passionate and willing to perform mass genocide I mean really can you imagine if this was flipped it for one night everyone living as a gay man in America all just went out and searched to molest little boys so the entire country boards up their houses to protect their children from these monsters or once a year every progressive runs out and collects children and pumps them full of hormone blockers because it's the cisgender purge day like no this would be so awful and extremely troubling to make a movie with such a troubling stereotype towards one massive group of people now people have every right to spend their money creating and writing stories that they want to and people want to go see them go ahead but I also have the right to give my opinion and call it out for being the regressive race baiting nonsense that it is I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood all right if you like this video and others like it please consider becoming a Premium Member to the rebel that way you'll have first access to pure Hollywood and the entire rebel lineup you
