previously we went to McDonald's and
order it off their secret menu mmm no
but today we're gonna order off the
secret menu at Chipotle specifically the
case of reasoning Cimino do you know how
to make the case Rito
this is my first time how many people
order it
how much you guys talk about
three
this is the chicken kayseri toe and it's
1.84 pounds and it's also 1205 calories
with a flour tortilla
melted cheese white rice black beans
chicken tomato salsa corn salsa lettuce
sour cream and more cheese
so it was really disappointing watching
them make a case of Rito at Chipotle
because I took an extra five minutes to
make this thing and they use just a
little bit of cheese and only one flour
tortilla you know I expected it to be
two flour tortillas with a bunch of
cheese wrapped around a burrito so let's
see if it tastes as disappointing as it
looks
I expected sort of a cheese explosion in
a case Cerrito you know that's what it
sounds like but honestly this was a
little underwhelming and you can see why
it's not on the regular menu it tastes
just about the same and maybe it's like
a little toasted but it's not really
worth your time as a customer to order
it
