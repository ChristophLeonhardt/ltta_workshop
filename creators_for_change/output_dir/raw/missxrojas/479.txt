hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I could spend the next</font>

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,540
two minutes telling you about how I

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,609
actually did make videos I just never

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">got around to uploading them like this</font>

5

home for a while I which you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and</font>

11
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,369
I actually just came back from watching

12
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,140
The King's Speech in the Sonora and I

13
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought it was absolutely terrific I</font>

14
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,320
really recommend it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

massive film buff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go to the cinema</font>

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,080
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really enjoy the</font>

17
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,510
experience it's just fun i'm going to

18
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,980
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and going to see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,140
represent stores in a different way than

20
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,120
kind of my preferred way of books and

21
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,790
how the now to changes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

22
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,230
writing changes when you're writing for

23
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,600
film and when you're waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in</font>

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,640
a book but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i always didn't have five</font>

25
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,440
seconds to even think about that kind of

26
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,410
stuff because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> King's Speech was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

27
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,059
so beautifully done it just ran together

28
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,390
incredibly well and Geoffrey Rush and

29
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,149
Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter

30
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:57,000
just stood out beyond most things that

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen this year actually not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,379
and I've just I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so impressed a lot</font>

34
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,790
of people tell me that I should go see

35
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,930
black swan though because everyone

36
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,430
saying very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good things like that but if</font>

37
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,750
you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen the king's speech then</font>

38
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">i encourage you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so my mother</font>

39
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,140
brought me a cup of tea for biscuit and

40
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,689
a mince pie and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pies aren't meaty</font>

41
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,000
they have raisins in them and other

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,240
sultanas and things anyway look<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

43
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,890
recently finished and got for christmas

44
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,509
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth but Stephen Fry's to fry</font>

45
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:25,979
chronicles which is the second part to

46
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,630
his autobiography the first part being

47
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,390
mayor up if my wash pot and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

48
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,610
alluded to future biographies coming I

49
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,619
hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do I hope they're written</font>

50
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,350
because I I find seen the frame to be

51
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">really interesting I don't know what it</font>

52
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,090
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about him I think it's because and</font>

53
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,110
this is something that he talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

54
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,119
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit in the book he's seen as</font>

55
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,460
being like the quintessential Englishman

56
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,790
and almost retro vintage anachronism

57
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,740
living amongst<font color="#E5E5E5"> us I find it interesting</font>

58
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,500
why we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see him like that to what</font>

59
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,689
extent he presents himself like that how

60
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">that whole idea works within our</font>

61
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:00,689
culture's it's been really interesting

62
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,420
to read about his university years and

63
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,680
the friends he made there obviously

64
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,540
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> hugh laurie and emma thompson</font>

65
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,890
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to hear him</font>

66
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,179
talk about his encounters with other

67
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,370
writers especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> ben elton who was</font>

68
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,800
kind of prolific writer would put

69
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,020
like 50 pages while Stephen Fry and Hugh

70
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,940
Laurie would write like one some points

71
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,020
it felt like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of an</font>

72
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,310
out-of-body experience they were

73
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly insecurities that you talked</font>

74
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,430
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I found like oh I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

75
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,080
identified what they were saying this is

76
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,340
stephen fry<font color="#E5E5E5"> like he's a big day how can</font>

77
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">i identify with them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it just goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

78
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,240
show like the power of celebrity and

79
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,390
making you feel like you're wrong to

80
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,880
identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> with something in an</font>

81
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,860
autobiography my head is weird secondly

82
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finish never let me go in your</font>

83
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,460
pants which I actually really did love

84
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,020
and a commenter when I first thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

85
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,820
was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read it I'm sorry I can't</font>

86
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,650
remember your username said that and

87
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,940
when they first<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it they finish that</font>

88
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,740
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were like oh it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright whatever</font>

89
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,990
wasn't really that big a deal but then

90
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,490
once you start thinking about it more

91
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more it has like this kind of slow</font>

92
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,030
burning impact on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

93
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,650
I've really found as well especially

94
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,330
seeing the trailer for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the film is</font>

95
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,390
actually making a very big comment on

96
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,640
again how we come to recognize ourselves

97
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,410
as human and recognize other people as

98
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,280
human and how we fail at doing that you

99
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,020
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

100
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,580
let me go the narration was really good

101
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,590
it's from a female perspective of lady

102
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">called Kathy H the novels written by man</font>

103
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that's always quite impressive</font>

104
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,800
but i really i really like never let me

105
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,209
go also if you don't feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

106
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,430
the cinema and I don't know you've got

107
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,290
some DVD vouchers and stuff especially

108
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,730
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the USA cuz I don't think</font>

112
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,739
times at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> points that I just can't</font>
