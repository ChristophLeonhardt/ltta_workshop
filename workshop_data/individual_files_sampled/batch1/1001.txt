inside this makeshift kitchen in Guatemala's Highlands Martha quiqui prepares lunch for children her son Alex looks healthy but the one-year-old is in medical terms chronically malnourished traditional diets here lack vital nutrients meaning children can be 15 centimeters shorter than they should be but stunting also affects brain development and a child's ability to learn making it harder to break the cycle of poverty our children eat the same things that we eat and when there's a possibility to give them something extra you do it because you want what's best for your children I gave my children what I'm able to but sometimes it's a struggle around half of all Guatemalan children under five are chronically malnourished and in indigenous communities like Martha's that number is even higher Guatemala might be one of the region's main agricultural producers but it also has the world's sixth highest rate of chronic child malnutrition it's a combination of poverty lack of access to education and lack of access to health care that's causing the problem but one group says that they're trying something new to resolve this Rosetta Coon brings health care to the rural families who need it the most armed with scales a measuring board and nutrition booklets Rosa visits mothers with children under two to combat stunting the NGO she works for focuses on the first thousand days of life raising awareness and empowering women is key but building that trust takes time some others simply don't know about child malnutrition or the importance of complimentary foods it's good for them to learn how to look after their children better and you see how happy they are when their children gain weight the program's project manager says this personal approach is paying off Ella community and with our hands in the communities where we've introduced this program we've seen a reduction in chronic child malnutrition by up to 20% of the last two or three years this is a big achievement people here are becoming more aware this problem exists it's not just families like Marta's who pay the price for chronic childhood malnutrition it's estimated that stunting costs Guatemala around 3.5 billion dollars a year but without a major investment by the government to private groups millions of children here will fail to reach their potential David Mercer al-jazeera baarish keen Guatemala
