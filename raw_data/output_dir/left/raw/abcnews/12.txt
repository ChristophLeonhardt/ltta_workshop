1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,845
GOOD DAY.

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,079
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,313
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING HIS 

4
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:16,449
FIRST ON CAMERA COMMENTS SINCE 

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,285
ARRIVING HOME TO THE BIPARTISAN 

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,953
BACKLASH TO HIS APPEARANCE 

7
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:23,423
YESTERDAY HE STOOD ALONGSIDE THE

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,457
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN

9
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,658
AND APPEARED TO THROW THE 

10
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,526
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,861
UNDER THE BUS.

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,362
TRUMP WAS ASKED BY A REPORTER 

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,297
WHO HE BELIEVED WHEN IT CAME TO 

14
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,367
ELECTION MEDDLING IN 2016, PUTIN

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,968
OR THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE 

16
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:36,235
AGENCIES?

17
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:38,771
TRUMP SEEMED TO SIDE WITH PUTIN.

18
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:40,173
THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST SPOKEN TO

19
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,741
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 

20
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,210
AT THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THE 

21
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:44,577
UPROAR.

22
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,811
WE'LL HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY IN

23
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:46,812
A MINUTE.

24
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,814
FIRST, WE'LL CHECK IN WITH 

25
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:49,381
PIERRE THOMAS.

26
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,751
>> Reporter: I THINK THE KEY TO 

27
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:57,356
WATCH FOR IS THE PRESIDENT 

28
00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:58,858
DIRECTLY ADDRESS WHERE HE 

29
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,793
APPEARED TO SIDE WITH PUTIN AND 

30
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:03,362
DISAGREE WITH HIS OWN 

31
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:03,963
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT 

32
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,364
CONCLUDED EMPHATICALLY THAT THE 

33
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:06,799
RUSSIANS DID, IN FACT, TARGET 

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,666
THE 2016 ELECTION. 

35
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:14,073
>> AND ARE YOU HEARING WHAT KIND

36
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,508
OF RUMBLING ARE YOU HEARING FROM

37
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,010
THE COMMUNITY?

38
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,713
>> Reporter: THEIR DRAWS 

39
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:20,947
DROPPED.

40
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,783
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY 

41
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,551
SAW THE PRESIDENT DO.

42
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,287
THEY WERE SHOCKED. 

43
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,187
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THE 

44
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:31,891
PRESIDENT COULD SAY TO REASSURE 

45
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,625
THEM COMPLETELY?

46
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,426
>> Reporter: WELL, WE'RE GOING 

47
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,360
IT HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE 

48
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,428
PRESIDENT SAYS.

49
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,129
I KNOW THEY'RE WAITING TO SEE 

50
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:39,098
PRECISELY HOW HE ADDRESSES THE 

51
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:39,331
ISSUE. 

52
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:41,567
>> AND AS WE KNOW, WE WILL BE 

53
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,770
HEARING OURSELVES IN JUST A FEW 

54
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,271
SECONDS, AS THE VIDEO TAPE COMES

55
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,174
IN FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

56
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,242
THE PRESIDENT IN THE ROOSEVELT 

57
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,344
ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 

58
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,044
REPUBLICANS OF THE HOUSE WAYS 

59
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:53,112
AND MEANS COMMITTEE.

60
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:53,846
HERE HE IS. 

61
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:54,914
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

62
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,583
YESTERDAY I RETURNED FROM A TRIP

63
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,351
FROM EUROPE WHERE I MET WITH 

64
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,587
LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE REGION 

65
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,122
TO SEEK A MORE PEACEFUL FUTURE 

66
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:03,722
FOR THE UNITED STATES.

67
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:07,694
WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD WITH OUR

68
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,729
ALLIES AND ALL OVER THE WORLD.

69
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,795
WE'RE WORKING WE'RE GOING TO 

70
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:11,598
HAVE PEACE.

71
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,398
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.

72
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,900
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.

73
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,569
I SAY PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.

74
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,874
I HAVE HELPED THE NATO ALLIANCE 

75
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:23,843
GREATLY BY INCREASING DEFENSE 

76
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,345
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR NATO 

77
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,314
ALLIES BY OVER $44 BILLION, AND 

78
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,116
SECRETARY WAS FANTASTIC, AS YOU 

79
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,517
KNOW, HE REPORTED THAT THEY 

80
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,586
NEVER HAD AN INCREASE LIKE IN IN

81
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,521
THE HISTORY AND NATO IS GOING 

82
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,890
DOWN AS OPPOSED TO GOING UP.

83
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,526
I INCREASED IT BY MY MEETING 

84
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,328
LAST YEAR $44 BILLION.

85
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,330
THIS YEAR WILL BE OVER HUNDREDS 

86
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,567
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE 

87
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,335
COMING YEARS.

88
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,037
I THINK THERE'S GREAT UNITY WITH

89
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,405
NATO, AND THERE'S A LOT OF VERY 

90
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,173
POSITIVE THINGS HAPPENING.

91
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,841
THERE'S A GREAT SPIRIT THAT WE 

92
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:56,876
DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE, AND THERE'S 

93
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,544
A LOT OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE 

94
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,078
PUTTING UP.

95
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,212
THEY WEREN'T PAYING THEIR BILLS 

96
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:03,182
ON TIME, AND NOW THEY'RE DOING 

97
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,019
THAT.

98
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,453
AND I WANT TO JUST SAY THANK YOU

99
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:12,958
VERY MUCH TO THE SECRETARY HE'S 

100
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,360
BEEN TERRIFIC.

101
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,461
WE HAD A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.

102
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,662
I HAD MEETINGS WITH PRIME 

103
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:19,632
MINISTER MAY ON THE RANGE OF 

104
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:23,302
ISSUES CONCERNING OUR SPECIAL 

105
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:23,936
RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT'S BETWEEN

106
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,439
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 

107
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:26,706
OURSELVES.

108
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,075
WE MET WITH THE QUEEN, WHO WAS 

109
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,877
ABSOLUTELY A TERRIFIC PERSON.

110
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,980
SHE REVIEWED HER HONOR GUARD FOR

111
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,817
THE FIRST TIME IN 70 YEARS, THEY

112
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,118
TELL ME.

113
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,786
WE WALKED IN FRONT OF THE HONOR 

114
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:42,288
GUARD AND THAT WAS VERY 

115
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,091
INSPIRING TO SEE AND BE WITH 

116
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,160
HER, AND I THINK THE 

117
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,561
RELATIONSHIP I CAN TRULY SAY, IS

118
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,462
A GOOD ONE.

119
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,030
BUT SHE WAS VERY, VERY 

120
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,431
INSPIRING, INDEED.

121
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:57,737
MOST RECENTLY, I RETURNED FROM 

122
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,637
HELSENKE, FINLAND AND I WAS 

123
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,873
GOING TO GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE 

124
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,942
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS 

125
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,077
ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.

126
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,878
AS SUCCESSFUL AS NATO WAS, I 

127
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,980
THINK THIS WAS OUR MOST 

128
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,349
SUCCESSFUL VISIT, AND THAT HAD 

129
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,317
TO DO, AS YOU KNOW, WITH RUSSIA.

130
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,253
I MET WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 

131
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,088
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO 

132
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,357
TACKLE SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING

133
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,358
ISSUES FACING HUMANITY.

134
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,229
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN AT A WORSE 

135
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,398
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIAN THAN 

136
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,200
WE ARE AS OF A FEW DAYS AGO.

137
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,634
I THINK THAT'S GOTTEN 

138
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:29,602
SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER.

139
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,335
I THINK IT HAS THE POSSIBILITY 

140
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,171
OF GETTING MUCH BETTER.

141
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,940
I USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS DURING

142
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,609
THE CAMPAIGN GETTING ALONG WITH 

143
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,309
RUSSIA WOULD BE A GOOD THING.

144
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:38,277
GETTING ALONG WITH CHINA WOULD 

145
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,045
BE A GOOD THING.

146
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,079
NOT A BAD THING.

147
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,646
A GOOD THING.

148
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:46,686
IN FACT, A VERY GOOD THING.

149
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,721
RUSSIA AND US HAVE 90% OF THE 

150
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,089
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

151
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,091
I'VE FELT GETTING ALONG IS A 

152
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:52,658
POSITIVE THING.

153
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,959
NOT JUST FOR THAT REASON.

154
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,928
I ENTERED THE MEETING WITH THE 

155
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,496
FIRM CONVICTION THAT DIPLOMACY 

156
00:04:57,496 --> 00:04:59,532
AND ENGAGEMENT IS BETTER THAN 

157
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,567
HOSTILITY AND CONFLICT.

158
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,504
I FEEL THAT WITH EVERYBODY.

159
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,772
WE HAVE 29 MEMBERS IN NATO, AS 

160
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:07,874
AN EXAMPLE.

161
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,974
AND I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS 

162
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:10,610
OR AT LEAST VERY GOOD 

163
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,244
RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVERYBODY.

164
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,080
THE PRESS COVERED IT QUITE 

165
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,414
INACCURATELY.

166
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:17,116
THEY SAID I INSULTED PEOPLE.

167
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,718
I'M ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO PAY UP 

168
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,655
MONEY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY IS

169
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,589
INSULTING, MAYBE I DID.

170
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,758
BUT I CAN TELL YOU, WHEN I LEFT,

171
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,725
EVERYBODY WAS THRILLED AND 

172
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:30,129
THAT'S THE WAY THIS WAS, TOO.

173
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,732
MY MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 

174
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,734
WAS REALLY INTERESTING IN SO 

175
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,035
MANY WAYS, BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T 

176
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,404
HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH RUSSIA 

177
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,008
FOR A LONG TIME, AND WE STARTED.

178
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,178
LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT ONCE

179
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,079
AGAIN, THE FULL FAITH AND 

180
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,382
SUPPORT FOR AMERICA'S 

181
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,917
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, I HAVE A 

182
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:54,753
FULL FAITH IN OUR INTELLIGENCE 

183
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:55,020
AGENCIES.

184
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,956
WHOOPS, THEY TURNED OFF THE 

185
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:57,189
LIGHTS.

186
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,959
THAT MUST BE THE INTELLIGENCE 

187
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,226
AGENCIES.

188
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,227
THERE IT GOES.

189
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:01,494
OKAY.

190
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,730
YOU GUYS OKAY?

191
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,631
ALL RIGHT.

192
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,031
THAT WAS STRANGE.

193
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,601
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

194
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,205
I'LL BEGIN BY STATING THAT I 

195
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,007
HAVE FULL FAITH AND SUPPORT FOR 

196
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,608
AMERICA'S GREAT INTELLIGENCE 

197
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,710
AGENCIES.

198
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,811
ALWAYS HAVE.

199
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,846
AND I HAVE FELT VERY STRONGLY 

200
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:24,850
THAT WHILE RUSSIA'S ACTIONS HAD 

201
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,819
NO EFFECT AT ALL ON THE OUTCOME 

202
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,287
OF THE ELECTION, LET ME BE 

203
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,389
TOTALLY CLEAR IN SAYING THAT, 

204
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,026
AND I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES, I

205
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:37,096
ACCEPT OUR INTELLIGENCE 

206
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:37,963
COMMUNITIES' CONCLUSION THAT 

207
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:43,903
RUSSIA'S MEDDLING IN THE 2016 

208
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,605
ELECTION TOOK PLACE.

209
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,905
COULD BE OTHER PEOPLE, ALSO.

210
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,609
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT 

211
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:49,809
THERE.

212
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,277
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AT ALL.

213
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,712
AND PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THAT.

214
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,946
THEY'VE SEEN THAT STRONGLY.

215
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,314
THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY COME OUT 

216
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,616
VERY STRONGLY ON THAT.

217
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,883
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT 

218
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:58,684
STRONGLY ON THAT.

219
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,519
I THOUGHT THAT I MADE MYSELF 

220
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,823
VERY CLEAR BY HAVING JUST 

221
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,590
REVIEWED THE TRANSCRIPT.

222
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,625
NOW I HAVE TO SAY, I CAME BACK 

223
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,160
AND I SAID WHAT IS GOING ON?

224
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,362
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

225
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,031
SO I GOT A TRANSCRIPT, I 

226
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:12,965
REVIEWED IT.

227
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,435
I ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND REVIEWED

228
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,772
IT WITH AN ANSWER I GAVE, AND I 

229
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,442
REALIZE THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME

230
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:23,775
CLARIFICATION.

231
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:25,611
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS, I 

232
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,813
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OBVIOUS, BUT

233
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,282
I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY, IN CASE

234
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,083
IT WASN'T, IN A KEY SENTENCE IN 

235
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,787
MY REMARKS, I SAID THE WORD 

236
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,157
"WOULD" INSTEAD OF WITH THE 

237
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:38,658
WOULDN'T."

238
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,059
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN I DON'T SEE 

239
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,661
ANY REASON WHY I WOULDN'T OR WHY

240
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,931
IT WOULDN'T BE RUSSIA.

241
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,266
SO JUST TO REPEAT IT.

242
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,937
I SAID THE WORD "WOULD" INSTEAD 

243
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,937
OF" WOULDN'T."

244
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:55,107
AND THE SENTENCE WAS I THOUGHT I

245
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,174
WOULD BE MAYBE A LITTLE UNCLEAR 

246
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:58,611
ON THE TRANSCRIPT OR THE VIDEO.

247
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,014
THE SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, I

248
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:02,614
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY IT 

249
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:04,683
WOULDN'T BE RUSSIA.

250
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:07,887
SORT OF A DOUBLE NEGATIVE.

251
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,422
SO YOU CAN PUT THAT IN.

252
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,589
AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY 

253
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,292
CLARIFIES THINGS PRETTY GOOD BY 

254
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:13,759
ITSELF.

255
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,795
I HAVE ON, NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, 

256
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:17,930
NOTED OUR INTELLIGENCE FINDINGS 

257
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,200
THAT RUSSIANS ATTEMPTED TO 

258
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,767
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS.

259
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,669
UNLIKE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS,

260
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,371
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS AND WILL 

261
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,974
CONTINUE TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY TO

262
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,210
REPEAL ANY EFFORTS AND REPEL.

263
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,280
WE'LL STOP IT, WE'LL REPEL IT.

264
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,416
ANY EFFORTS TO INTERFERE IN OUR 

265
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:37,683
ELECTIONS.

266
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,051
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR 

267
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,354
POWER TO PREVENT RUSSIAN 

268
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,623
INTERFERENCE IN 2018, AND WE 

269
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:46,492
HAVE A LOT OF POWER.

270
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,862
AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS

271
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,431
GIVEN INFORMATION JUST PRIOR TO 

272
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,834
THE ELECTION, THE LAST ELECTION,

273
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,569
2016, AND THEY DECIDED NOT TO DO

274
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,004
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

275
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,906
THE REASON THEY DECIDED THAT WAS

276
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,174
PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ALL.

277
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,744
THEY THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS

278
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,844
GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION.

279
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,212
THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A BIG 

280
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:07,513
DEAL.

281
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,348
WHEN I WON THE ELECTION, THEY 

282
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,483
THOUGHT IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

283
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,617
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WENT INTO 

284
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:11,951
ACTION.

285
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,620
BUT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LATE.

286
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,755
SO HE WAS GIVEN THAT IN SHARP 

287
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:20,459
CONTRAST TO THE WAY IT SHOULD 

288
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:20,626
BE.

289
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,762
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, ALONG WITH 

290
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,063
BRENNAN AND CLAPPER AND THE 

291
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,464
WHOLE GROUP THAT YOU SEE ON 

292
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,632
TELEVISION NOW PROBABLY GETTING 

293
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,233
PAID A LOT OF MONEY BY YOUR 

294
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,569
NETWORKS, THEY KNEW ABOUT 

295
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,370
RUSSIA'S ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE IN

296
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,773
THE ELECTION IN SEPTEMBER.

297
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:35,908
THEY TOTALLY BURIED IT.

298
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,776
AS I SAID, THEY BURIED IT 

299
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:38,677
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT 

300
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,046
HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO 

301
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:41,580
WIN.

302
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,982
IT TURNED OUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN 

303
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,315
THAT WAY.

304
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,050
BY CONTRAST, MY ADMINISTRATION 

305
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,956
IS TAKING A VERY FIRM STANCE.

306
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:53,726
IT'S A FIRM STANCE ON A STRONG 

307
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:53,960
ACTION.

308
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,528
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE STRONG 

309
00:09:56,528 --> 00:10:02,201
ACTION TO SECURE OUR ELECTION 

310
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,070
SYSTEMS AND THE PROCESS.

311
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,738
FURTHER MORE, AS HAS BEEN STATED

312
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,073
AND WE'VE STATED PREVIOUSLY IN 

313
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:11,377
MANY OCCASIONS, NO COLLUSION.

314
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,211
YESTERDAY WE MADE SIGNIFICANT 

315
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,980
PROGRESS TOWARD IMPRESSING SOME 

316
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,049
OF THE WORST CONFLICTS ON EARTH.

317
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,618
WHEN I MET WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 

318
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:25,858
FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS,

319
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,227
AND AMONG THOSE THINGS ARE THE 

320
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,764
PROBLEMS THAT YOU SEE IN THE 

321
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,499
MIDDLE EAST WHERE THEY ARE VERY 

322
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,366
MUCH INVOLVED.

323
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:35,034
WE ARE VERY MUCH INVOLVED.

324
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,203
I ENTERED THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH 

325
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,470
PRESIDENT PUTIN FROM A POSITION 

326
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,039
OF TREMENDOUS STRENGTH.

327
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,407
OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING.

328
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:45,478
AND OUR MILITARY IS BEING FUNDED

329
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,681
$700 BILLION THIS YEAR.

330
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,715
$716 BILLION NEXT YEAR.

331
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,350
IT WILL BE MORE POWERFUL AS A 

332
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,120
MILITARY THAN WE'VE EVER HAD 

333
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,353
BEFORE.

334
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,988
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I ADDRESSED 

335
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,957
A RANGE OF ISSUES STARTING WITH 

336
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:03,863
THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA, AND NEED

337
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,631
FOR HUMANITARIAN AID AND HELP 

338
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,833
FOR PEOPLE IN SYRIA.

339
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,401
WE ALSO SPOKE OF IRAN AND THE 

340
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,637
NEED TO HOLD THE NUCLEAR 

341
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,074
AMBITIONS AND THE DESTABILIZING 

342
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,911
ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE IN IRAN,

343
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,948
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW WE ENDED THE

344
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,017
IRAN DEAL WHICH WAS ONE OF THE 

345
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,184
WORST DEALS ANYONE COULD 

346
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:26,719
IMAGINE.

347
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,587
AND THAT'S HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON

348
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,790
IRAN AND SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKENED 

349
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,990
IRAN.

350
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,491
AND WE HOPE AT SOME POINT IRAN 

351
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,259
WILL CALL US AND MAYBE WE'LL 

352
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,895
MAKE A NEW DEAL.

353
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,594
MAYBE WE WON'T.

354
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:39,198
BUT IRAN IS NOT THE SAME COUNTRY

355
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,466
IT WAS FIVE MONTHS AGO.

356
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,235
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.

357
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,036
THEY ARE NO LONGER LOOKING SO 

358
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,371
MUCH TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AND 

359
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,205
THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST.

360
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,109
THEY HAVE BIG PROBLEMS THAT THEY

361
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,111
CAN SOLVE PROBABLY MUCH EASIER 

362
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,613
IF THEY DEAL WITH US.

363
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,847
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

364
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,650
BUT WE DID DISCUSS.

365
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,218
WE DISCUSSED ISRAEL AND THE 

366
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,553
SECURITY OF ISRAEL.

367
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,023
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN IS VERY MUCH

368
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,226
INVOLVED NOW WITH US.

369
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,328
AND THE DISCUSSION WITH 

370
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,697
NETANYAHU ON WORKING SOMETHING 

371
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,133
OUT ON WORKING SOMETHING OUT 

372
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,634
WITH SURROUNDING SYRIA, AND 

373
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,670
SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE

374
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,238
SECURITY AND LONG-TERM SECURITY 

375
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,707
OF CENTRAL ISRAEL.

376
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,041
A MAJOR TOPIC OF DISCUSSION WAS 

377
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,576
NORTH KOREA, THE NEED TO REMOVE 

378
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,213
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

379
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,547
RUSSIA HAS ASSURED US OF ITS 

380
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:30,449
SUPPORT.

381
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,451
PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS HE AGREES 

382
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,286
WITH HIS 100% AND THEY WILL DO 

383
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,955
WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO TO MAKE

384
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:36,555
IT HAPPEN.

385
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,224
DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING AND 

386
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,625
GOING WELL.

387
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,328
WE HAVE NO RUSH FOR SPEED.

388
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,496
THE SANCTIONS ARE REMAINING.

389
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:46,532
THE HOSTAGES ARE BACK.

390
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,601
THERE HAVE BEEN NO TESTS.

391
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,635
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ROCKETS GOING

392
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,404
UP FOR A PERIOD OF NINE MONTHS.

393
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,906
AND I THINK THE RELATIONSHIPS 

394
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,840
ARE VERY GOOD.

395
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,775
SO WELL SEE HOW THAT GOES.

396
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,142
.

397
00:12:57,142 --> 00:13:00,379
WE HAVE NO TIME LIMIT AND NO 

398
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:00,779
SPEED LIMIT.

399
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,581
WE ARE JUST GOING THREW THE 

400
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:02,814
PROCESS.

401
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:04,216
BUT THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY 

402
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:04,650
GOOD.

403
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,152
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS GOING TO BE 

404
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,621
INVOLVED IN THE SENSE THAT HE 

405
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,690
IS -- HE IS WITH US AND WOULD 

406
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,158
LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

407
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,059
PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE

408
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,061
WE DISCUSSED AT THE MEETING 

409
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,029
PRIOR TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE 

410
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,997
WAS THE REDUCTION OF NUCLEAR 

411
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:21,000
WEAPONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

412
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,968
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA 

413
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,903
HAVE 90%, AS I SAID, AND WE CAN 

414
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,639
HAVE A BIG IMPACT.

415
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,841
BUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS I THINK 

416
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,544
THE GREATEST THREAT OF OUR WORLD

417
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:33,045
TODAY.

418
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,246
AND THEY'RE A GREAT NUCLEAR 

419
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:34,713
POWER.

420
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,783
WE ARE A GREAT NUCLEAR POWER.

421
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,586
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 

422
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:40,920
NUCLEAR.

423
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,022
AND SO THAT WAS A MATTER THAT WE

424
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,590
DISCUSSED ACTUALLY IN GREAT 

425
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,157
DETAIL.

426
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,059
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN AGREES WITH 

427
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,460
ME.

428
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,629
THE MATTERS WE DISCUSSED ARE 

429
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,697
PROFOUND IN THEIR IMPORTANCE AND

430
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:57,102
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE 

431
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:57,502
MILLIONS OF LIVES.

432
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:59,371
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MANY 

433
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,772
DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN OUR 

434
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:01,507
COUNTRIES.

435
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,775
BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE 

436
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,543
DIALOGUE -- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

437
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,278
IT, DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA OR 

438
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,513
DIALOGUE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES 

439
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,548
BUT DIALOGUE IN THIS CASE WHERE 

440
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,016
WE HAVE HAD SUCH POOR 

441
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,618
RELATIONSHIPS FOR SO MANY YEARS.

442
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,819
DIALOGUE IS A VERY IMPORTANT 

443
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,220
THING AND A GOOD THING.

444
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,889
SO IF WE GET ALONG WITH THEM, 

445
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:18,324
DRAET.

446
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,758
IF WE DON'T GET ALONG WITH THEM 

447
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,493
THEN WE WON'T GET ALONG WITH 

448
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:21,693
THEM.

449
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,062
BUT I THINK WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 

450
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,196
CHANCE OF HAVING SOME VERY 

451
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:25,998
POSITIVE THINGS.

452
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,434
I THOUGHT THE MEETING I HAD WITH

453
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,902
PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS REALLY 

454
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:30,135
STRONG.

455
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,103
I THINK THAT THEY WERE WILLING 

456
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,606
TO DO THINGS THAT, FRANKLY I 

457
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:35,306
WASN'T SURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY 

458
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:36,909
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO.

459
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,677
AND WE'LL BE HAVING FUTURE 

460
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:38,944
MEETINGS.

461
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,078
AND WE'LL SEE WHETHER OR NOT 

462
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:41,914
THAT COMES TO FRUITION.

463
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,483
BUT WE HAD A VERY VERY GOOD 

464
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:44,950
MEETING.

465
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,219
I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR UP -- I 

466
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:51,223
HAVE THE STRONGEST RESPECT FOR 

467
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,325
OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HEADED

468
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,060
BY MY PEOPLE.

469
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,229
WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE, WHETHER 

470
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,100
IT'S GINA, DAN COATES, ANY OF 

471
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,533
THEM.

472
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,536
I MEAN WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 

473
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:04,937
PEOPLE.

474
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,306
TREMENDOUS TALENT WITHIN THE 

475
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:07,773
AGENCIES.

476
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,441
I THINK THEY'RE BEING GUIDED 

477
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:09,708
PROPERLY.

478
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,977
AND WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING.

479
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,012
WE WANT SUCCESS FOR OUR COUNTRY.

480
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:14,613
SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO 

481
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,349
START A MEETING NOW ON TAX 

482
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:17,649
REDUCTIONS.

483
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,085
WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING IN A 

484
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,588
BILL, KEVIN BRADY IS WITH US.

485
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,323
AND I MIGHT ASK KEVIN TO SAY A 

486
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,392
COUPLE OF WORDS ABOUT THAT.

487
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,459
AND THEN WE'LL GET BACK TO 

488
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:27,926
PRIVATE MEETING.

489
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,529
BUT KEVIN COULD YOU MAYBE GIVE A

490
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,598

WE'LL BE TALK ETALKING ZBRA OKAY

WE'RE CUTTING IN HERE YOU JUST 

493
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:37,903
HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAK IN 

494
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,104
THE ROOSEVELT ROOM AT THE WHITE 

495
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:39,438
HOUSE.

496
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,507
HIS FIRST ON CAMERA COMMENTS 

497
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:43,842
SINCE ARRIVING BACK HOME AFTER 

498
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,043
THE CONTROVERSY HE SPARKED OVER 

499
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,879
IN HELSINKI, FINLAND WHEN HE 

500
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,981
APPEARED ALONGSIDE THE RUSSIAN 

501
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,015
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN.

502
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,951
AND APPEARED TO SIDE WITH PUTIN 

503
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,219
OVER AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE 

504
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:59,224
AGENCIES ON THE QUESTION OF 2016

505
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,192
ELECTION MEDDLING.

506
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,726
RIGHT THERE HE SAID, HOWEVER, HE

507
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:02,727
DOES ACCEPT THE CONCLUSIONS AND 

508
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:06,498
THAT HE STRONGLY SUPPORTS AND 

509
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,634
APPRECIATES THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF

510
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,069
THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE 

511
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,336
AGENCIES.

512
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,939
LET'S BRING IN ABC'S CHIEF 

513
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:14,539
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PIERRE 

514
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,274
THOMAS WHO COVERS THE 

515
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:18,010
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES FOR US.

516
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,778
PIERRE, THE PRESIDENT SATISFIES 

517
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,246
CASE SEEMED TO WHITTLE DOWN TO 

518
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,448
WONDER WON WORD.

519
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,448
HE SAID YESTERDAY ON THE PODIUM 

520
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,617
UP NEXT TO VLADIMIR PUTIN WHEN 

521
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:30,789
ASKED WHETHER THE RUSSIAN 

522
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,191
MEDDLED, HE SAID I DON'T SEE ANY

523
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,826
REASON WHY IT WOULD BE RUSSIA.

524
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,564
BUT HE SAID TODAY WHAT HE MEANT 

525
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,231
TO SAY HE MEANT TO SAY I DON'T 

526
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,899
SEE ANY REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T 

527
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,568
BE RUSSIA.

528
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,902
WILL THAT ONE WORD TWEAK BE 

529
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,871
ENOUGH TO SATISFY SOURCES OVER 

530
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,672
IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 

531
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,208
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY, DAN BUT THE

532
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,977
PRESIDENT IS BASICALLY SAYING HE

533
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:52,478
MISSPOKE.

534
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,346
HE INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT RUSSIA

535
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,515
HAD EVERY REASON TO WANT TO 

536
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,216
ATTACKS THE ELECTION BUT THAT'S 

537
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,884
NOT HOW IT CAME ACROSS.

538
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,586
AND HE CERTAINLY DID NOT ATTACK 

539
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,321
THE RUSSIANS FOR WHAT THEY DID.

540
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,589
AND THAT'S WHAT SOME IN THE 

541
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,022
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WANTED 

542
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:05,790
HIM TO DO.

543
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,726
FRANKLY THEY WANTED HIM TO ISSUE

544
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,261
A STATEMENT ALONG THE LINE THAT 

545
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,229
IS DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

546
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,797
AND THEY DIDN'T GET THAT.

547
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,066
TODAY, THEY SAW THE PRESIDENT 

548
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,968
ATTEMPT TO BASICALLY EXPRESS HIS

549
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:16,667
FULL SUPPORT.

550
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,871
HE SAID HE HAD FAITH IN THE 

551
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,371
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

552
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,807
THAT THEY -- HE SUPPORTED THEM.

553
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:22,941
BUT YESTERDAY IT DIDN'T APPEAR 

554
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,208
TO BE.

555
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,577
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN AS TO 

556
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,645
WHETHER THEY WILL ACCEPT BHA HE 

557
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,045
SAID TODAY, DAN. 

558
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,147
>> AND THE CONCERN GOES BEYOND 

559
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:30,448
NOT ACCEPTING OR APPEARING NOT 

560
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:33,652
TO ACCEPT THEIR CONCLUSION AT 

561
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,819
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE IN 

562
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:35,687
HELSINKI YESTERDAY.

563
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,356
AND IT GOES BEYOND NOT ATTACKING

564
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,224
THE RUSSIANS WHO ARE ATTACKING 

565
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,259
US.

566
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,059
BUT ALSO WHAT THE "WALL  STREET 

567
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,562
JOURNAL" IN THEIR EDITORIAL 

568
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,129
TODAY -- THE "WALL  STREET 

569
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,864
JOURNAL" NOT KNOWN TO BE A LEFT 

570
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,700
LEANING PUBLICATION REFERRED TO 

571
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,237
AS A BESEECHING DEMEANOR BY THE 

572
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,272
U.S. PRESIDENT IN THE PRESENCE 

573
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,240
OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT.

574
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,075
WILL THE COMMENTS TODAY BE 

575
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,944
ENOUGH TO TAKE SOME OF THE EDGE 

576
00:17:58,944 --> 00:17:59,311
OFF THAT. 

577
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,513
>> DAN, I THINK THE BIG QUESTION

578
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,848
REMAINING IS THE WHY.

579
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:03,682
WHY DID THE PRESIDENT ACT THE 

580
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,784
WAY HE DID YESTERDAY?

581
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,052
NOW SOME PEOPLE SUPPORTERS WHO 

582
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,722
I'VE TALKED TO IN THE PAST 

583
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,791
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 

584
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,493
ANGRY THAT HIS ELECTION WIN WAS 

585
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,694
TAINTED BY HACKING BY RUSSIANS.

586
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:19,965
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE 

587
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,099
KNOWS HE DIDN'T COLLUDE AND HE 

588
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,568
IS FRUSTRATED.

589
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,136
AND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO AREN'T 

590
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,237
SURE ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE.

591
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,105
THAT'S THE QUESTION REMAINS.

592
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,674
WHY HAS HE BEEN SO WILLING TO 

593
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,209
NOT PROVOKE PUTIN?

594
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,210
>> PIERRE THOMAS.

595
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,677
THANK YOU.

596
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,479
LET'S BRING IN ABC'S TOREY MORAN

597
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,012
IN HELSINKI.

598
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:36,748
HE WAS IN THE ROOM DURING THE 

599
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:41,186
PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY.

600
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,222
TERRY LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 

601
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,856
DOMESTIC POLITICS OF THIS.

602
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:46,725
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN 

603
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,594
HEAT FROM MANY WHO ARE NORMALLY 

604
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,196
IN HIS CORNER PB THE FORMER 

605
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,631
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NEWT 

606
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,099
GINRICH CALLING THIS THE SINGLE 

607
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,634
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS 

608
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:55,934
PRESIDENCY.

609
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,169
DO YOU THINK WHAT WE JUST HEARD 

610
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,337
INCLUDING THE TWEAK FROM THE 

611
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:01,807
WORD WOULD TO WOULDN'T WILL HELP

612
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,409
THE PRESIDENT WITH HIS ALLIES?

613
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,112
>> I DO, DAN, BECAUSE THE 

614
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:07,912
AMERICAN POLITICS RIGHT NOW HAS 

615
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,414
LESS TO DO WITH WHO YOU BELIEVE 

616
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,917
IN SOME WAYS THAN WHO YOU HATE, 

617
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,719
FRANKLY.

618
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,087
AND DONALD TRUMP HAS A GENIUS IN

619
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,588
GETTING PEOPLE ON THAT TURF.

620
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,992
AS LONG AS HE DOES A JOB OF 

621
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,192
EXPRESSING FAITH IN THE 

622
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:21,960
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND 

623
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,863
EXPLAINING WHAT HE DID HERE, 

624
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,232
JUST IN THAT BUILDING BEHIND ME 

625
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,202
SAYING HE MISSPOKE HE WILL RALLY

626
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,136
I THINK HIS TROOPS BECAUSE HE IS

627
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,772
SHIFTING THE GROUND TO IT'S OOB,

628
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,806
THE LIBERALS, THE MEDIA, THE 

629
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,073
DEMOCRATS.

630
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,541
I THINK THAT WILL HELP HIM.

631
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,743
I THINK, HOWEVER, THERE WILL BE 

632
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:41,446
SOME WHO HAVE A LINGERING BAD 

633
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,614
FEELING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN 

634
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,049
THAT BUILDING BEHIND ME.

635
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,018
AND MIGHT NOTE THAT IT'S BEEN 30

636
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,952
HOURS SINCE HE MISSPOKE.

637
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,853
HE HAS GIVEN TWO INTERVIEWS 

638
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,889
SINCE THEN TO TUCKER CARLSON AND

639
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:55,927
TO SEAN HANNITY OF FOX NEWS AND 

640
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,663
TWEETS AS HE CAME HOME AND HE 

641
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,830
NEVER REALIZED OR RESPONDED IN 

642
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,466
THIS WAY THAT HE HAD MISSPOKEN.

643
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,134
ONE MORE THING.

644
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,736
IT MAY BE ONE THING TO RALLY THE

645
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,136
DOMESTIC AUDIENCE.

646
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:06,738
IT'S QUITE ANOTHER TO CHANGE THE

647
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,106
PERCEPTION OF PEOPLE AROUND THE 

648
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,174
WORLD WHO SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN 

649
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:13,111
THAT ROOM, READ AND SAW THE 

650
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,180
BESEECHING DEMEANOR, THE 

651
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,282
SUBSERVIENT DEMEANOR THAT THE 

652
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:19,551
"WALL  STREET JOURNAL" JOET 

653
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:19,818
FLOATED.

654
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,853
I WAS IN BRUT WHEN BARACK OBAMA 

655
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,821
DREW THE RED LYNN AND SAID THE 

656
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,524
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA

657
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,860
WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED AND 

658
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,196
FOLLOWED BY MILITARY ACTION.

659
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,931
AND HE BLINKED HE NEVER 

660
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,533
RECOVERED IN THE ARAB WORLD.

661
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,735
AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT HIM 

662
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,569
CHANGED AROUND THE WORLD.

663
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,304
I THINK THE WORLD, CERTAINLY 

664
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,274
WORLD LEADERS THEY SAW A MAN 

665
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,442
ONE-ON-ONE WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 

666
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:47,045
WHO WAS SUBSERVIENT, BEE 

667
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,081
SEARCHING AS THE "WALL  STREET 

668
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,682
JOURNAL" PUTS IT.

669
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,984
THAT'S HARD FOR DONALD TRUMP TO 

670
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:53,284
OVERCOMING. 

671
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,187
>> THE GLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS WILL

672
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,021
CONTINUE TO UNFOLD AND THE 

673
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,488
POLITICAL FORCES HERE AT HOME AS

00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,357
WELL BECAUSE THERE IS SOME TALK 

675
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,826
THAT CONGRESS MAY TAKE ACTION.

676
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:02,760
WE'LL OF COURSE BE FOLLOWING 

677
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:02,994
THAT.

678
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:06,031
