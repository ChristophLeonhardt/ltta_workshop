00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so in today's video I want</font>

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,879
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you a little bit about the</font>

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,950
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think are going up in May</font>

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,710
yes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my first thing maybe a little</font>

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,780
unconventional but i would say gardening

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,490
the sun's out now so you can stay out

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,500
gardening till the evenings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if like</font>

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,240
me you've left your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christmas tree out</font>

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,480
to die in the garden until May then it's

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,279
probably time to haul it to the house

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,410
pine needles<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all and throw it in the</font>

12
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,330
communal bin outside your flat<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you</font>

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,890
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good shoes preferably ones</font>

14
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,449
that cover your ankles because you never

15
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,550
know those pesky nettles I wore like

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,189
some great boots that I have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

17
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,559
some light clothing because one tends to

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,719
get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit sweaty when gardening</font>

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,510
and some good gardening gloves hours

20
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,370
were actually once we found at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99p</font>

21
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">store but they're good 99p store gloves</font>

106
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,350
beautiful and thin and light and that's

107
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,000
what I really like about that's the

108
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,200
clothes I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go for like the really</font>

109
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,299
thin light ones that you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,739
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about moving in that's why i love</font>

112
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,350
those clothes I don't like things that

113
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,730
feel constricted that's why don't really

114
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">wear any jeans because I feel like jeans</font>

115
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,790
really constrict me that's why I'll

116
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,380
never be Lauren Conrad properly then

117
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,359
there's this dress so cool the best

118
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:49,620
thing at the moment is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Topsail has</font>

125
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,900
much good stuff I've literally had to

126
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,060
ban myself from shopping at topshop but

127
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,769
then also they were staples things like

128
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">my leather dress that I bought over</font>

133
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,779
because I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy it</font>

134
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,700
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love topshop so chop chop is also</font>

135
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,320
going up sticking in the fashion vein

136
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,450
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a vein</font>

137
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,280
we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> go too much on this channel</font>

138
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,500

spring colors it's just so good like I

143
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,030
