NOW BACK TO "JUSTICE WITH JUDGE
JEANINE."
JUDGE JEANINE: WELCOME BACK TO
ALL OF YOU SAY THE AND MOST OF
YOU PROBABLY HEARD MY AND
WHOOPI'S VERSION.
WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEE WAS AFTER I
WAS THROWN OFF THE SET.
I'M NOT HERE TO REHASH OLD NEWS,
AND IN THE SPIRIT OF TONIGHT'S
OPENING STATEMENT I WOULD LIKE
TO CLOSE THE BOOK ON THIS AND
SOME OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT I
HAVE KNOWN WHOOPI GOLDBERG FOR
YEARS, AND OUR RIP UP UNTIL THIS
WEEK HAS ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDLY.
FURTHERMORE, I HAVE BEEN A GUEST
ON THE VIEW MANY TIMES BEFORE
THURSDAY'S APPEARANCE AND WAS
ALWAYS TREATED WITH RESPECT.
MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT ABOUT HOW
I CONDUCTED MYSELF AND HOW I WAS
TREATED.
TO WHOOPI, I ACCEPT YOU AND I
HAVE DIFFERENCE VERSIONS OF WHAT
WENT ON BOTH ON AND OFF THE AIR
AND WE HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
TAKES ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE
JOB HE'S DOING.
LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE AND PUT
THIS EPISODE TO BED ONCE AND FOR
ALL.
THANKS FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF
YOUR COMMENTS FRIDAY TO PAY ME A
COMPLIMENT.
>> GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR BOOK.
I HEAR IT'S NUMBER ONE.
I PREFERRED YOUR LAST BOOK.
BUT THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR
TASTE.
I LOOKED THE BOOK.
JUDGE JEANINE: THANKS, WHOOPI, I
PREFERRED YOU IN THE MOVIE
GHOSTS MUCH MORE THAN I DO ON
