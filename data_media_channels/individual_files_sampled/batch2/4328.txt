it was almost midnight on January 16th which was a school night but Wisconsin's Republican Governor Scott Walker wanted everybody to please wake the heck up 11:28 p.m. all caps wake up call can't presume that voters know we are getting positive things done in Wisconsin two minutes later 11:30 p.m. again all caps wake up call can't presume voters know that more people are working than ever before another two minutes later 1132 p.m. all caps wake up call can't presume that voters know that we invested more actual dollars and if presumably Governor Walker went to bed with his phone in his hand because he woke up and then just kept going 909 a.m. the next morning all caps wake up call 914 a.m. all caps wake up call 919 a.m. wake up call 923 a.m. wake up call and on and on and on he's like the world's most broken snooze button the thing Governor Walker was trying to alert everyone to was the fact that Democrats in his state had just flipped a deep red state Senate seat in western Wisconsin Donald Trump had won that red district by 17 points but it was the Democrat in a special election who won that seat and won by 10 points it was a 27 point swing in the Democrats favor on what was considered to be a safe a safe Republican district and and when that supposedly safe Republican district suddenly went to a Democrat in a special election this past January Governor Scott Walker then spent the better part of the night and following morning rage tweeting at Wisconsin Republicans for letting it happen for letting that safe Republican seat slip through their fingers wake up call wake up call but it turns out that Governor Scott Walker had something else to work with besides just his phone by that time that he was raged tweeting that way Governor Walker had Walker had already decided that he would refuse to hold the special election for two other vacants legislative seats in Wisconsin seats that had both previously been held by Republicans and honestly it seemed a little suspicious basically everybody in the state thought it was pretty clear and obvious the governor was just worried that Republicans might lose those seats to Democrats if the people of Wisconsin actually had a chance to vote on filling those seats in into more special elections whether or not that was the governor's naked partisan motivation for refusing to hold elections and fill those seats the law in Wisconsin was pretty clear in saying that he had to you can't just leave seats open for months and months and months and months and not let people vote on somebody to fill them it's a representative democracy you need representatives but that that is what the governor tried to do and for a long time it looked like he was going to get away with it until somebody intervened and that someone was Eric Holder former attorney general of the United States under President Obama after the 2016 election Eric Holder and President Obama formed a new group called the National Democratic redistricting committee and one of the first places they made themselves known was Wisconsin where Governor Walker was outright refusing to hold elections to fill those open seats in the state legislature they sued Governor Walker to force him to hold special elections for those open seats and it took three separate judges to rule against him in that case but finally Governor Walker admitted defeat and put a couple of special elections on the calendar Eric Holder won Scott Walker 0cu won in court today yep in Wisconsin that's another that's another gift that keeps on giving you know Scott Walker just keeps he keeps gifts they like hit me Eric I'm like oh okay that was March of this year right after Eric Holder's group won that court battle against governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin a couple of months later Eric Holder and his group notched another win when Rebecca dalit won a 10-year term to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and it's weird to vote on judges but they do in Wisconsin and in that race that was the the first time a candidate backed by liberals had won an open seat on that court in 23 years Eric Holder had campaigned for delat in Madison and Milwaukee his group had pushed over a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in digital ads to boost her campaign meanwhile a conservative candidate who governor scott walker personally endorsed for a different judgeship that walker endorsed candidate lost his race in that election and just to put a little bit of icing on the cake voters also rejected a Republican ballot initiative that had been supported by Governor Walker as well so what have you been up to since 2016 Eric Holder has been busy he's been beating one of the highest profile Republican governors in the country up and down the ballot in and out of court on the governor's home turf and he's up for more the main thrust of this group that Eric Holder founded with President Obama is actually about the district maps that determine which candidates run where when Republicans swept the midterm elections in 2010 the first midterms of the Obama era not only did they retake control of Congress they also took control of 21 legislative chambers across the country and legislative chambers draw district maps them taking all those legislative chambers allowed Republicans to rewrite legislative and congressional maps in all those states in what turned out to be an organized effective effort to basically lock Republicans into power for the next 10 years by virtue of the districts that they had drawn for themselves the Eric Holder National Democratic redistricting committee this group that he founded with President Obama they're fighting that battle they're trying to fight back for Democrats against what Republicans so successfully pulled off with those new maps that they got drawn after 2010 the Eric Holder Barack Obama group has has pursued lawsuits in Virginia and Georgia and Texas and North Carolina and Pennsylvania to try to get States to UM gerrymander their Maps in January North Carolina's gerrymandered congressional map got ruled unconstitutional by a phantom panel of federal judges who found that the maps were quote motivated by invidious partisan intent in February the Pennsylvania Supreme Court also took apart the pro-republican gerrymandered maps for that state to the court issued a new sort of technocratic lead wrong congressional map where the districts were redrawn to be more fair to both parties so at least in those two states the voting districts will already be more fair in time for this year's midterm elections in November and that's just one part of the multi-pronged strategy that Eric Holder's group is working on this year Steve Kornacki got the group's executive director to explain what that effort looks like now and what to expect next so when you look at the map you know Democrats trying to take I think 23 seats right now to get control of the house where is gerrymandering the gerrymandering you say Republicans have done where is that most prevalent on that sort of house battlefield right now well our job is to look at the map through every districting lens and when you do that you want to go after the states that are most gerrymandering so those states are Ohio Michigan North Carolina Texas Virginia Florida Wisconsin all the big systems like so all the big ones and you can you see from that there is a direct correlation particularly with the governor's races there are a lot of gubernatorial races in those states this year which means we are electing the governor who will oversee the redistricting process and there are a lot of House seats in those states as well what is your your group folks looking at this and saying hey I'm a Democrat Knight this is my hope for fixing this issue what is it that if they're looking to support your group or something what is it you're giving them this year is it is it looking at getting ballot you know questions in these states is it just elect Democrats is that the solution here just elect Democrats in these states so our model which is what makes us different and what has never been done before is a comprehensive approach so it does include elections it includes getting Democrats elected so that the Republicans aren't controlling the entire process again it does include reform where we can reform the system and make the process more fair we also have a very aggressive litigation strategy because they broke the law and they should be held accountable and so we've seen real success on redistricting in the courts and then also voter engagement and making sure that the grass roots are involved in redistricting that there's real public awareness about the significance of this issue and in terms of public activity we're gonna see from you from from your group this fall what's that going to look like publicly are people gonna see you guys out there talking about this absolutely we've seen us a lot already we were very involved in the governor's race in Virginia we've been involved in some of the reform efforts that you've seen we were very involved in a Supreme Court race in Wisconsin because that was an important race for redistricting we've identified 12 target states around the country Attorney General Holder has been on the road traveling for candidates and we've done a lot as well in terms of raising awareness around gerrymandering filing lawsuits and the rest so you will see more of us throughout 2018 and beyond what about Barack Obama are we gonna see him at all he's talked about this as one of his his most important issues this is one of his most important issues and I think we will all see more of him as 2018 continues is that a hint of something you know that we don't you'll have to ask him that was Steve Kornacki with the executive director of Eric Holder's new organization that is committed to unjam and during congressional maps across the country as you heard their state lawmakers across the country play a really important role not just in how State Politics work but also how the entire US Congress looks as well and right now it is of unavoidable political importance to the US Congress that members of that Congress are grappling with one of the biggest political scandals to hit this country in decades I have more on that next hey
