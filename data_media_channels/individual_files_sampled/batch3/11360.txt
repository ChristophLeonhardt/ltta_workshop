one of Hollywood's biggest scandals was kept under wraps by a prominent news channel that's the claim of one NBC producer who says journalists were deliberately stopped from breaking accusations against Harvey Weinstein I was told not to do the interview and ordered to stand down thus effectively killing the story those orders came to me from the highest levels of NBC that was unethical and a massive breach of journalistic integrity McHugh is the first person linked to NBC to publicly accuse the network of meddling in his and freelance correspondent Ronan Pharos attempts to pursue the story McHugh and Pharos spent months collecting material on the allegations two months after they faced resistance from the network fara went to the New Yorker and published the first in his series of articles on Weinstein the pieces won him a Pulitzer Prize since the publication of Pharos article in October 2017 more than 70 women have come forward with allegations against the film producer Weinstein handed himself into New York police in May 2000 18 and shortly afterwards was charged with rape and several counts of sexual abuse he denies all allegations with the court cases still ongoing NBC says that the assertion that key Vevey tried to kill the Weinstein story is an outright lie instead the network suggests that Pharos material lacked sufficient evidence and was simply not ready for broadcast if he was threatened by the chief counsel legal counsel of NBC News and that's a big if with with you know destroying his persona and slamming his reputation even after he left and be hey then he might have a legal case against that attorney and NBC well I gotta tell you you know legally killing a story for whatever reason I hate to say it it happens all the time I mean I've been in this business for over 35 years and people have told me oh don't go there don't do that calm down on that so that's not unusual it might be disturbing and should be disturbing to the viewers of NBC when it when the story gets out if this is true but as far as pursuing a story I'm sure like I said it happens all the time but if you are employed there and you come out and you say you're being stymied in your efforts to unveil or in you know investigate a story you're not going to be working there much longer so I'm sure it happens all the time you
