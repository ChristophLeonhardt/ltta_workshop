now they're both doing it first Donald Trump then Vladimir Putin fighting about which one of them has the biggest missile here is Donald Trump at the State of the Union address as part of our defense we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal hopefully never having to use it but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression and so of course the other insecure man with the weaker military and their weaker economy has to do it too today in the Russian equivalent of a State of the Union address Vladimir Putin said that Russia has developed a new generation of nuclear weapons he describes some of them as invincible one is an intercontinental cruise missile and the other is a nuclear torpedo in his speech today President Putin promised a giant increase in social spending including doubling spending on health care and at the same time announced this massive new spending on nuclear weapons Putin insisted that these weapons already exist but instead of showing the weapons he showed an animation video of what the new nuclear cruise missiles could do with the route of the missile ending over Florida where the President of the United States is known to spend so many of his weekends on golf courses Moscow has not come close to such an overt rhetorical threat against the United States since the darkest days of the Soviet Union all previous presidents have always stood publicly and immediately against threats from Moscow but not the current President of the United States but of course Donald Trump continues to behave as if he is owned by Vladimir Putin he did not say a single word about the Putin threats today here is some of an interview NBC's megyn kelly conducted with Vladimir Putin in Moscow today after Putin's announcement of those weapons several analysts and the West's have said this is the declaration of a new Cold War are we in a new arms race right now my point of view is the individuals who have said that new Cold War has started are not really analysts they do propaganda if you were to speak about arms race then an arms race began at exactly the time and moment when the u.s. opted out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty some analysts are suggesting you've tested it and it's failed and that's why you only showed animations of it today and have not yet produced any actual videos are you talking about IC BM yes the one that you claim renders defense systems useless as a matter of fact every single weapon system discussed today easily surpasses and avoids an anti-missile defense system you've tested it the test was excellent some of them still have to be fine-tuned and worked on others are already available to the troops and already are battle ready for the record right now do you have a workable ICBM that's powered by nukes that you've tested successfully all of those tests were successful it's just each of these weapon systems is at a different stage of readiness one of them is already on combat duty it's with troops NBC News says that megyn kelly will have more reporting from Russia in the next few days hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
