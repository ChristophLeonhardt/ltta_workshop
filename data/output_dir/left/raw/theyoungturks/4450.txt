1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,810
DONALD TRUMP HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF
CRITICISM, FROM OUR SHOW

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,550
PRIMARILY, BUT FROM A LOT OF
QUARTERS, THAT HE DOESN'T

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,820
FUNDAMENTALLY KNOW THE FACTS
ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,820
BUT A

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,230
LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT'S NOT
JUST HEY IT'S SAD THAT OUR

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,799
PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW THE
DETAILS OF ONE OF THE MOST

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,939
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT NEEDS TO
BE DONE, A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO

8
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:20,350
BE SOLVED IN AMERICA, BUT ALSO
THAT IT'S HURTING HIS PARTY'S

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,240
CHANCE OF PASSING SOME SORT OF
ALTERNATE PLAN.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
SO HE CAN'T TALK

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,410
ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE SENATE BILL
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T SEEM TO

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,410
UNDERSTAND.

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,099
IF YOU GAVE HIM A
COUPLE OF TERMS HE WOULDN'T

14
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,980
REMEMBER THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE
ATTACHED TO ANY CONCEPTS IN HIS

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,980
BRAIN.

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,590
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
THEY TRIED TO PREPARE HIM A

17
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,040
LITTLE BIT FOR THIS MEETING.

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,920
SO
JAYAR JACKSON WENT THROUGH AND

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,930
COMPILED SOME OF THE THINGS HE
REFERENCED ABOUT THE PLAN, NOW

20
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,060
HE IS TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICS
ABOUT IT, BUT WATCH THIS VIDEO

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,260
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT
THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT THOSE

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,400
SPECIFICS.

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,270
>>WE NEVER SELL OUR PLAN.

24
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,020
IF WE
ARE WEAK ON ANYTHING IT'S ABOUT

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,150
LETTING PEOPLE KNOW HOW GOOD IT
WAS SO WE WROTE THESE THINGS.

26
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,050
REPEALS THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE,
REPEALS JOB KILLING EMPLOYER

27
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,780
MANDATE, WILL SUBSTANTIALLY
LOWER PREMIUMS.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
YOUR PREMIUMS

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,780
WILL BE DOWN 60 AND THESE
THINGS.

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,780
REPEALS THE INDIVIDUAL

31
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,780
MANDATE, REPEALS JOB KILLING
EMPLOYER MANDATE, WILL

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,780
SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PREMIUMS.

33
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,780
YOUR PREMIUMS WILL BE DOWN

34
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,780
60, 70%, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT.

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
REPEALS BURDENSOME TAXES, BIG.

36
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,020
ALSO PROVIDES FOR EXPANDED
COVERAGE OPTIONS.

37
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
WILL STABILIZE

38
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,250
INSURANCE MARKETS.

39
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,159
WILL PROTECT
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION COVERAGE.

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,860
YOU WILL HAVE BETTER
PRE-EXISTING THAN THEY HAD IN

41
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,960
THEIR PLAN.

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,280
WILL ALLOW THE USE
OF PRETAX DOLLARS TO PAY

43
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
PREMIUMS.

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,030
WILL DEVOTE
SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO FIGHT

45
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,280
OPIOID AND OTHER SUBSTANCE
ABUSE.

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
WILL PROVIDE BETTER

47
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,260
COVERAGE FOR LOW-INCOME
AMERICANS.

48
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,620
PUTS MEDICAID ON A

49
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,500
SUSTAINABLE PATH, WHICH IT'S NOT
ON RIGHT NOW.

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,530
REFORMS MAJOR

51
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,299
ENTITLEMENTS, NOW A PRINCIPAL
DRIVER OF THE $20

52
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,830
TRILLION DEBT WE HAVE.

53
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,210
>>WE CAN PICK APART THE VARIOUS
LIES IMPLICIT IN THAT, THE 70%

54
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,780
PREMIUM DROPS, THAT'S ABSOLUTE
B.S., BUT JAYAR PRINTED UP HIS

55
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,360
TALKING POINTS BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT HE WAS GIVEN.

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
THEY KNEW HE

57
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,068
COULDN'T GO TO THAT MEETING AND
TALK ABOUT THE BILL WITH

58
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,540
AUTHORITY AND KNOWLEDGE, SO THEY
DID WHAT YOU SHOULD DO FOR

59
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,300
POLITICIANS, I'M NOT EVEN
KNOCKING THE AIDES, THEY PRINTED

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,310
UP THINGS FOR HIM TO SORT OF
EXTEMPORANEOUSLY REFER TO.

61
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,310
LET

62
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,310
ME TALK ABOUT THE TAXES, ETC.

63
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,349
BUT INSTEAD THIS KNUCKLEHEAD

64
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,079
JUST READS THE LITERAL WORDS IN
A BULLET POINT LIST BECAUSE THEY

65
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,780
DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO HIM.

66
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,420
YOU
COULDN'T SEE ANA'S REACTION BUT

67
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,980
WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, HE SAID

68
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,069
YOU WILL HAVE BETTER
PRE-EXISTING THAN YOU HAVE NOW.

69
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,790
BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT THAT
MEANS.

70
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,849
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY

71
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,819
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PRE-EXISTING
CONDITIONS OR HOW HISTORICALLY

72
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,470
THEY MADE IT HARDER FOR YOU TO
GET HEALTH INSURANCE -- TO HIM

73
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,870
THE WORD PRE-EXISTING JUST MEANS
SOMETHING.

74
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,109
SO HE THROWS IT OUT

75
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:55,159
THERE IS A BUZZWORD.

76
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,329
THIS MEANS
NOTHING TO HIM.

77
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:02,859
>>IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE
ALREADY KNOW, BASED ON POLLING,

78
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:05,719
THAT IS BASE HAS MADE VERY
LOYAL TO HIM.

79
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,029
BUT I'M CURIOUS

80
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:10,239
WHAT HIS BASE -- IF YOU SIT DOWN
AND HAVE A POLITE CONVERSATION

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,969
WITH THEM AND BRING UP THE FACT
THAT HE JUST SAID IT REPEALS THE

82
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,730
EMPLOYER MANDATE, THAT
ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT IF YOU

83
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,909
ARE A COMPANY THAT EMPLOYS A
CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNDER

84
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,340
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT YOU ARE
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE HEALTH

85
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,830
INSURANCE.

86
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,749
HE JUST BRAGGED ABOUT
HOW THE REPLACEMENT PLAN WOULD

87
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:32,299
DO AWAY WITH THAT, SO YOUR
EMPLOYER DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE

88
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,419
YOU THAT BENEFIT.

89
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,670
IS THAT
SOMETHING HIS BASE IS IN FAVOR

90
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,670
OF?

91
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,370
>>MAYBE SOME PEOPLE VALUE THEIR
COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE MORE THAN

92
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,620
THEIR FAMILY'S HEALTH.

93
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,060
IT'S
POSSIBLE.

94
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,600
>>I THINK THEY BEEN DISTANT
FORMED TO THE POINT WHERE THEY

95
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,569
UNFORTUNATELY VOTE IN FAVOR OF
THINGS LIKE THAT WITHOUT

96
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,400
REALIZING HOW MUCH IT WOULD
NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEM.

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
BUT

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,439
AGAIN, HE JUST BRAGGED ABOUT
YEAH, YOUR EMPLOYER DOESN'T HAVE

99
00:03:58,439 --> 00:00:00,000
TO PROVIDE THIS BENEFIT THAT
WOULD SAVE YOUR LIFE.
