well I don't know if you've been able to follow the the latest news revolving around the church sex abuse scandal over the last couple of days I know there's been a lot of a lot of blood of big news out there but this is this this development is truly massive it is is breathtaking words words really fail to describe it I'm gonna I'm gonna do my best to unpack this and to kind of break it down for you and then I'll give a few thoughts of my own but my main point here the main thing I want to do is just kind of give you the basics of this because it's kind of hard to follow along so Pope Francis has been accused of personally when he was Pope personally covering up sexual abuse this accusation comes from us from an archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano who's a former papal nuncio to the United States that's basically an ambassador for the Vatican so this is a high-ranking person this is not some random nobody okay this is a person with intimate knowledge of what's going on with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the church and the hierarchy this isn't a conspiracy theorist on a blog somewhere this isn't a guy ranting in his car okay because why would you want to listen to somebody like that this is this is one of the guys who has been in the upper echelon of the church hierarchy and now he's spilling his guts which is absolutely incredible um the allegations revolve around Cardinal McCarrick who was one of the most powerful was one of the most powerful Catholics in the United States in the world really and it's recently been revealed that Cardinal McCarrick is a serial pervert and an abuser he's been accused many accusations gonna against them he's been accused of molesting two children but the lion's share and that's the only reason that we're finding out about everything involving mckarrick is because of those accusations but the lion's share of his alleged sins have to do with his behavior with young priests and seminarians he's been accused of groping assaulting a young priests and seminarians he's been accused of using seminaries as as if they're you know some kind of gay prostitution house where he would come in and select his own little harem of of homosexual seminaries and and and seminarians and and priests and he would take them back to his beach house or whatever and they would have gay orgies and all these kind of thing I mean this is just just he was a deviant pervert abuser and disappear until I quit whinin in Hollywood this was an open secret from secret for many years in the church although the secret was not open or known among average lay Catholics this was a secret openly known by many bishops and Cardinals and if you believe Vigano the Pope as well Pagano discharged his accusations in a stunning 11 page document I cannot begin to summarize everything that he says but again I emphasize this is somebody who has he's 77 years old now he's been in the church it's been in the hierarchy of the church for many many years he has seen a lot of things he's heard a lot of things he's documentation for a lot of things he's been involved in many conversations and now he is just pouring it all out and saying look this is what this is what I know and he's putting it all out there he essentially drops so it's worth reading the entire report if you haven't done that he essentially drops an atomic bomb on the entire network of cowards and perverts in the church he names names he calls out some of the highest-ranking people at church accuses them of lying conspiring covering up or of actually being homosexual predators themselves he tells a story about an actual conspiracy of homosexuals and homosexual defenders in the church who have worked in tandem together to keep men like mckarrick in positions of power this is something that little old people like myself and many others have been saying it exists in the church an actual high-ranking powerful network of homosexual predators we've been saying this for a long time that that exists and now you have someone who's in the nose who has seen it for himself and he is saying yes it's yes that that exists and this is not just a crackpot making up accusation this is like you know this is the equivalent of this will be like if nikki Haley came out and made musicians against the Trump administration that's that's what it would be like about halfway through the document so he spends the first half calling out one after another naming names a lot of names that you know most of us have never heard before although these are powerful people in the church but he's he's good one after the other he's calling people out he's putting their names out there about halfway through Vigano talks about Francis and he alleges that Pope Francis knew personally about mckarrick s abuses he says that he Vigano personally had a conversation about McCarrick with Francis so that's how he he knows that Francis knew because he spoke with him about Francis so he knows this isn't something he got second hand he knows it personally let me here's how he recounts a conversation he had with Francis about McCarrick he says I'm quoting for him him now he says the Pope asked me it asked me in a deceitful way what is Cardinal McCarrick like now the reason he says that this was deceitful is because Vigano alleges that Francis already knew about McCarrick he knew all about him and yet he was asking this question pretending like he didn't know so yes asks me what is Cardinal Carrick like I answered him with complete frankness and if you want with great naivete a holy father I don't know if you know McArdle mckarrick but if you ask the Congregation for bishops there's a dulce ere this thick about him he corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance the Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine it did not show any expression of surprise on his face as if he had already known the matter for some time and he immediately changed the subject later on díganos says he had a similar conversation with Cardinal Wuerl about McCarrick yet whorl has since pretended that in Cardon and whirl was was the bishop and in Pittsburgh he's the one he's been accused of covering up sex abuse crimes whirl has pretended ever since the information came out about McCarrick whirl has said oh I had no idea about this I'm so shocked and horrified and and saddened by it but Vigano says says that war will quote lies shamelessly called him a shameless liar it's like he knew about it because I talked with him about it as to the Pope it is alleged that Francis even after we got out established that Francis knew about the abuses and you'd talk to Francis about it Francis still kept mckarrick in positions of power and visibility allowing him to continue in his predations took no action against him until a few years later when the public found out about mckarrick and then he took actions against me what's more the Gallo says that that that Pope Benedict before Francis eventually found out about mckarrick when he was Pope he didn't find out sooner even though people had made an effort to let Benedict know about what about what mccarroll McCarrick had been up to and Vigano himself had sent memos to the Vatican to alert Pope Benedict as to the situation but according to Vigano there were there people high up in the Vatican who were keeping that information from Benedict but he did find out eventually he sanctioned mckarrick forbidding him from serving the church in any kind of public way requiring him to go into seclusion into a life of penance and fasting and the guy too alleges that Francis actually lifted those sanctions and reinstalled mckarrick despite knowing that McCarrick is a predator deviant he lifted the sanctions and put him back in public life where he could continue doing what he'd been doing Vigano then calls for a francis to step down which is think about this is is is incredible but to have someone in his position calling for the Pope to resign is it just it does not happen very often this is a kind of thing that just hardly ever happens so that's the summary of the report what else has happened since then well one of the men mentioned in díganos report a Monsignor Jean Francois has corroborated the report Vigano says that John Francois told him about the sanctions that Benedict placed on the carrick and now jean francois has given a two-sentence statement to the media saying Vigano said the truth that's all so that's a corroborations also a bishop from Texas and Cardinal Burke have both come out said that they think that the report is that the accusations are credible and that there needs to be a full investigation into them on the other side defenders of the Pope have made a few points number one they've claimed that Vigano himself it covered up sexual abuses years ago and they indicted his credibility by saying that hey you know if he knew about all this stuff why why didn't he come out earlier and say it why is he waiting till now now I don't know if the first thing is true or not I don't know if he's guilty of his own cover-ups but both of these points really do nothing to absolve Francis because in fact Vigano said himself in his report it tells us why he's coming out now and he says it's because he's an old man and he's looking to clear his conscience he knows he's gonna be standing before God before long and he doesn't want to go to God with all of this on his conscience so he's he's letting it out now he's trying to do the right thing now near the end before he has to face God so what guilty or innocent he personally is it's kind of irrelevant number two they have poked holes in the claim that Benedict sanctioned McCarrick pointing out that McCarrick was still celebrating mass was still going to other functions and everything under under Benedict maybe this means that the sanctions never occurred maybe it means they did but mckarrick defied them this the the whole thing about the sanctions that's one of the only things in the ganas report that he got secondhand okay he he heard about them and he says he heard about them from this Monsignor Jean Francois who has since corroborated most of the other stuff it's not secondhand he's saying these are conversations I personally had with the Pope and with others in the church so that means that the sanctions never happened I don't know but whether there were sanctions or not doesn't doesn't actually matter the real question the real question is did Francis know about McCarrick that's it that's like that's it that's that's the question did Francis know about Meharry before all of this came out in the media because if he did then we know he's guilty of covering for him because we know that he took no action against McCarrick until all this came out and that he did he had McCarrick in a position of power and visibility where he could you know he had access to priests and seminarians and everything else whether he was restored to power or simply allowed to remain in power is irrelevant actually all that matters is whether Francis knew that McCarrick was a predator and deviant and yet allowed him to continue that's what matters finally Pope Francis on the plane on the way home from Ireland was asked about this report and now you would think put yourself in Pope Francis's shoes you're the Pope okay and you've just been accused of this this this stunning accusation has just been leveled against you by someone who was high up in the church and someone who wrote an 11 page report detailing not just accusations against you but against many members of the hierarchy and people that are around you and that accusation comes out if it weren't true if it was all fake and made-up and false because that's what would have to be that that's kind of that's the situation that we're in either it's true or Archbishop Vigano is a desperate liar who at the age of 77 has concocted this whole story out of whole cloth and it for some reason and and is is you know his putting it out there even though he stands to gain absolutely nothing from it whatsoever but if that were the case you know near the Pope and somebody just invented this story and you're given the chance to clarify things you would think you'd be very eager to say no this is false it didn't happen it's it's it is simply false but that's not what the Pope said the Pope on the plane he was asked by CBS about this and this is what he said he said I will respond to your question but I would prefer that we first speak about the trip and then other topics this morning I read that statement I read it and I will say sincerely that I must tell you all this you CBS and all you who are interested read the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment I am not going to say a word about this I believe that the statement it speaks for itself and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions it is an act of trust when a little time goes by and you have drawn conclusions perhaps I will speak about it but I would like your professional maturity to do this work it will do you all good really what what I mean this is incredible Francis was asked directly if he knew about mckarrick if he lifted sanctions these are simple yes or no answer it's not it's not complicated there's no nuance to it you either knew about them but you did if you didn't then you just say no I didn't know about him there's absolutely no reason to to refrain from saying no I didn't know about him I didn't know it it's not true and if you didn't live sanctions then again no it's a couple it's crazy I didn't never happened but instead he refuses to answer the question and even encourages people to make up their own conclusions what and then even even chides the media and says and says like it'll be a character building exercise for them to draw their own conclusions which is exactly what they're not supposed to do in fact the media news news media is not supposed to draw its own conclusions about things like this they're supposed to do what they did which is go to the Pope go to the source and ask him did this happen get both sides of the story and Pope Francis is saying I'm not gonna give you my side of the story now there are only two ways to interpret this from Francis only two ways one he's guilty two he has so much disdain for the faithful in his church and so much hubris that he doesn't think he that he doesn't think he owes an explanation that's possible that both of these explanations are true at once or maybe one of them but there is no flattering interpretation for Pope Francis here refusing to answer the question either way this is a despicable response from Pope Francis he's being accused of a very serious infraction and people are calling him on him to step down in disgrace from the papacy which which again never happens and he doesn't even bother to respond what you don't even give a response and not only that but I mean forget about the media forget about Lugano or anyone that any other bishop or Cardinal whoever uh just the faithful ok the his flock the faithful in the church are reading about this stuff and they are greatly distressed and troubled and and I mean plenty out there who are teetering on the edge of despair over all this stuff and this is Pope Francis's response draw your own conclusions I won't respond as a service it's despicable um here's what I'll say if these allegations are true then Francis has to resign and if he won't resign then he has to be pushed out there has to be an outcry so loud from every Catholic and every good bishop and priest that he has no choice but to resign and disgrace if they're true because then he whacks the moral capacity to hold the office that he holds and he simply cannot continue holding um are the allegations true as the next question well we know that they're from a credible source and they're from a source who provides dates and quotations and says that he has further documentation we also know that he claims in the report that it will be corroborated by at least one of the person it is corroborated by that person the allegations are as I said breathtaking but not fantastical not unbelievable they are perfectly reasonable allegations and they fit with what we already know doesn't make them true but I think anytime somebody comes out with allegations like this you have to look and does it kind of fit in to the picture that we already does it's like when you're doing a putting together a puzzle and you know you see there are a lot of blank spaces and then you pick up a piece and you can look like does this does this piece even belong to this puzzle or not you should be able to at least tell that much based on what you've already put together and so in that sense it does appear to be a piece of the puzzle that belongs to this puzzle so we know all that and we also know that the Pope refused to refuse to respond one other point about that the only like I said refusing to respond when you're accused of something like this it could be that you're guilty and so you you don't want to say anything yet because you got to go back and you got to talk to your lawyers and you got a craft uh you talk to your PR people and you've got to talk to whole team of people and craft what your response is gonna be that that's only if you're guilty not if you're innocent that it's right if somebody comes up to you and says if police come up to you and say you're accused of murdering so-and-so did you do it and you didn't do it then you don't I mean you venture you'll talk to it you'll get a lawyer as well if you're arrested but but right off the bat you would say no I didn't do that of course you would deny it if you didn't do it there'll be no reason to refuse to deny it if it didn't happen I think much of the time the only the only only time when you really refuse to say anything even to issue a denial of something that of a very clear accusation is if there's at least some truth to it and so you need to figure out how to craft it but then the other as I said the other the other explanation is that you you have disdain for the person asking the question and you think that the accusations are so ridiculous that they aren't due or response now that is that's like there's there's a video of a but Buzz Aldrin he was confronted a few years ago by a moon landing conspiracy theorist one of these guys that thinks the moon landing never happened and Alderon refuses to respond to him and that eventually just punches him in the face which is great by the way just think that's awesome refused to respond just plant clocks the guy in the face now that is an appropriate response because the claim that you faked the moon landing is so stupid so ridiculous so beneath it's so really contemptible that it is not do an answer except for a punch in the nose this doesn't fall into that because we already know that there has been a far-reaching conspiracy within the hierarchy of the church to cover up sexual abuse we know that perfect so this is not a moon landing conspiracy and when you're asked about it is your moral duty to respond and if it's not true to issue that clarification and to give reassurance to the faithful and all people around the world so as I said if it is true than he has to resign whether or not it is true I guess we can at this point say with a hundred percent say you know say with a hundred percent certainty whether or not it is I think the dirt they're credible and I will say that I'm inclined to if I have to choose between believing somebody like Archbishop Vigano and believing the Cardinal Wuerl Cardinal McCarrick and now Pope Francis contingent I am going to be more inclined to believe the former either way these are very troubling times and many more bishops aside from just two of them need to speak up and say there has to be a full investigation into this we need a full investigation no more messing around with it and if there is any truth to these allegations then Pope Francis has to go thanks everybody for watching thanks for listening Godspeed
