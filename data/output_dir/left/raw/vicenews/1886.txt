3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,330
former home of Jefferson Davis was the

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,309
first and<font color="#E5E5E5"> only president of the</font>

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,590
Confederate States of America<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,240
grounds also include a Confederate

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Presidential Library cemetery and museum</font>

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,400
complete with tour guides in some pretty

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,680
sweet period clothes so what's the

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,500
significance of this place to you and

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,230
your family well Jefferson Davis was the

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,490
president of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Confederate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> states and</font>

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,460
in that time period soldiers I had no

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,719
place to go they would come here and

15
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,000
they you know they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> buried here they</font>

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,950
stayed till they died and then they were

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,010
buried here it's irritating when history

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,530
is told and accurately you know I mean

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,239
and we should all want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the truth</font>

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,390
all history is important not just civil

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,340
history but American history<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of</font>

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,770
American history you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people say oh</font>

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,430
the flag was on design to represent

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,460
white supremacy to us it symbolizes our

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,780
history not white people or black people

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,869
but all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in the south don't want to</font>

27
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,939
be buried and that want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice</font>

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> words</font>

31
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,110
for the average southern ER in 1861 they

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,780
had gotten incredibly tired of a

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">government that was not willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,580
its citizens play there are embargoes

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,710
and special taxation on southern

36
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,660
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to Europe for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> North</font>

37
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,970
it was an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Americanism keeping in</font>

38
