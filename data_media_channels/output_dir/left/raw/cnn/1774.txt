1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
joining us now is veteran NBC sports
broadcaster Bob Costas Bob great to have

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,429
you out so here on the snoring you've
seen it all in this business what's your

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,990
reaction to what happened this weekend
the reaction is so universal including

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,369
from prominent NFL owners who have
supported and donated to Trump's

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,369
campaign and to his inaugural committee
bob across the board and you have not

6
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,560
heard a single person within the NFL
raise a voice in support of what Trump

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,010
said Rex Ryan says he's appalled and now
ashamed that he once introduced Trump at

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,320
a rally in Buffalo where he then was the
coach what's happened here is that what

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,180
was already an issue raised primarily by
Colin Kaepernick has expanded beyond the

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,510
specific point that Kaepernick was
trying to make which is a very valid

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,149
point and now has become near-universal
disgust with the president's insulting

12
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,559
remarks your friend Peter King noted
that last week there are fewer than 10

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,670
NFL players who Neal did it some kind of
protests this weekend depending on how

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,140
you count it 250 include AI entire teams
how significant is that to see a

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,820
movement like that I can't think of
anything like that ever in the NFL no

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:19,650
but the president has galvanized players
of all backgrounds of all beliefs Drew

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,220
Brees and his complete statement says
that he'd never would feel comfortable

18
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,200
not standing for the national anthem but
he would stand locking arms with his

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,540
fellow players black and white or with a
hand on the shoulder of a black player

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,610
who is expressing his point of view and
he pointedly said that he found the

21
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,170
president's remarks inappropriate which
is kind I mean you know what's

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,890
interesting is the president could have
used this as a teachable moment to say

23
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,579
here's why I believe we should stand for
the national anthem here's what I

24
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,110
believe it stands for but he took a
different tact and it has I mean look we

25
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,969
saw what that was happening with just
the fans yelling at each other you know

26
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,280
there is something contagious about
divisive Ness yeah and it plays in

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,288
certain quarters you stir people's
emotions and resentments that's actually

28
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,650
a business plan in certain quarters of
the

29
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,560
or cable television it's a business plan
and it's the way President Trump for

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,200
better or worse approached his campaign
and approaches his presidency to give

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,879
him the extreme benefit of the doubt
extreme benefit of the doubt you'd say

32
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,349
he's insensitive to the racial
implications to make comments like this

33
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:40,019
at a rally in Alabama all right he likes
sheep applause lines which has no

34
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,319
football team and he delivered them has
no football electro football team yeah

35
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,760
and they're they're rabid football fans
down there that's to give them the

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,150
extreme benefit of the doubt but do you
want a President of the United States

37
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,230
who even if you're giving him the
benefit of that doubt is so tone deaf to

38
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,400
the racial implications of this it's
interesting because this morning one of

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,180
the things the president has written he
writes the issue of kneeling has nothing

40
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,810
to do with race it's about respect for
our country flag a national anthem NFL

41
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,280
must respect this now if you take your
attack there and say giving him the

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,939
extreme benefit of the doubt maybe for
him to the extreme benefit that it out

43
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,510
the issue of kneeling isn't about race
but for the players especially the

44
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,549
players initially to say it's not about
race that's not true 70 percent of the

45
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,079
players in the NFL roughly are African
American

46
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:34,349
virtually every player who knelt in the
initial stages of this was black and the

47
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:39,269
initial impetus from it before it came
from Colin Kaepernick and it was about

48
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,650
police brutality and mistreatment of
African Americans you can't separate

49
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,629
those two things now if you want to make
the point that the national anthem is

50
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:54,030
about something more than the nation's
flaws and shortcomings it's also about

51
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,250
its ideals and that people can see some
texture to what the national anthem

52
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,560
means and you might prefer that people
protest or make their point outside of

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,739
the national anthem that's something
that can be argued but the idea that

54
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,650
this doesn't have something to do with
race is preposterous michael steele

55
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,510
african american former head of the
Republican National Committee was

56
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,988
unsparing in his remarks about what
Trump had to say Bob Kraft who

57
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,479
contributed to the inaugural committee
you're not gonna find many voices of

58
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,310
support outside his base is a
scream base for these remarks Tom Brady

59
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,940
I mean Tom Brady back he said this
morning I believe this yeah just this

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,580
morning on a radio show I certainly
disagree with what he said I thought it

61
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,420
was divisive have we heard from Colin
Kaepernick no and I don't expect that we

62
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,140
will because he's been quiet for a long
long time sometimes he tweets some

63
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,910
things out I think it's actually a good
thing that this has gone now beyond

64
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,630
Colin Kaepernick and I'll tell you why
but we have to give Kaepernick credit

65
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,630
first of all taking a knee the first
game he sat and then it occurred to him

66
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,940
maybe sitting seems contemptuous
kneeling can be an act of grace Tim

67
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,980
Tebow knelt at various times it can be
an act of grace and an act of respect

68
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,620
but Kaepernick has whether people know
it or not has raised and or donated

69
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,760
millions and millions of dollars to
worthy causes he's walking the walk he's

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,160
involved in the community but Kaepernick
himself was an imperfect messenger he's

71
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,750
given to saying things like I don't vote
because the oppressor will never let you

72
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,700
vote your way out of your oppression so
I guess it doesn't matter to him who

73
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,390
wound up being president of the United
States it doesn't matter that when he

74
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:42,060
first knelt Barak Obama was president
and now someone who many of his fellow

75
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,610
African Americans and importantly many
of his fellow citizens of all races and

76
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,610
backgrounds object to it doesn't matter
to him he sometimes what Colin says when

77
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,440
he does speak makes it sound as if and I
say this with great respect for his

78
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,390
intentions and for what he has done
beyond kneeling on the field sometimes

79
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,370
he sounded like someone who took one
semester from a radical professor when

80
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,210
he was a freshman and that's all he
knows about the world so I think it's

81
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,330
better that additional voices hear from
multiple backgrounds weigh in because

82
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,980
Colin Kaepernick despite what some
people want to say is not the natural

83
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,260
heir to Muhammad Ali or Arthur Ashe or
to Kareem abdul-jabbar who continues to

84
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,910
be a public intellectual he's not he's
he's done he's tried to do a good thing

85
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,450
from his heart I don't know that he's
equipped to carry that baton in whether

86
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,520
or not he's the right person for he's
being punished I don't think there's any

87
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,030
question right he has the talent to be
playing football right now and he's now

88
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,320
yeah because of this he's better than
some starters and better than most

89
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,740
backups let me ask you again about a lot
of where the debate is about right now

90
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,810
because you hear from the president you
certainly hear it from his cabinet

91
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,240
including Steve manoosh and I'm not sure
we have that quote but the Treasury

92
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,400
secretary went on TV this weekend and
said this isn't about race it's about

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,390
respect for the military and first
responders and when you kneel you're

94
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,400
disrespecting the military and first
responders part of what's happened is

95
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,850
that sports and patriotism and the flag
have been conflated to such an extent

96
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:21,110
that people can't separate out any
nuance if you go to see Hamilton which

97
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,560
is about the founding of the Republic no
one says wait don't raise the curtain

98
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,040
until we hear the national anthem when
you went to see Private Ryan

99
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,880
no one said turn off the projector
Saving Private Ryan no one said turn off

100
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,720
the projector until we've had the
national anthem it's in sports where

101
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,890
this stuff happens sometimes movingly
sometimes I'd submit cynically because

102
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,250
wrapping yourself in the flag and
honoring the military is something which

103
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,080
no one is going to object to we all
respect their sacrifice we all honor

104
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,830
their sacrifice and yet what it has come
to mean is that the flag is primarily

105
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:04,070
and only about the military this is no
disrespect to the military it's a huge

106
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,140
part of the narrative but Martin Luther
King was a patriot susan b anthony was a

107
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,000
patriot dissidents are patriots
school teachers and social workers are

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,350
patriots and yet at Yankee Stadium if we
can shift sports not only do they play

109
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,740
the national anthem before the game but
they play god Bless America at the

110
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,130
seventh-inning stretch
81 times a year at home games and in

111
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:31,070
every case they say please rise as the
Yankees honor a military guest I have no

112
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,339
problem with that
I stand every time in the ballpark no

113
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,669
matter what it is I stand and I
certainly respect the military person

114
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,909
they bring out there but there's never a
schoolteacher there's never a social

115
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,210
worker patriotism comes in many forms
and what has happened is that it's been

116
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,970
conflated with with kind of a bumper
sticker kind of flag waving and with the

117
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,020
military only so that people
cannot see that in his own way colin

118
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,180
kaepernick however imperfectly is doing
a patriotic thing and so too are some of

119
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,750
these other players what do you think
this does this season for football do

120
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,700
you think that it will hurt ratings no I
think creases interesting yes yesterday

121
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,530
every telecast including Sunday Night
Football on NBC showed the National

122
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,960
Anthem generally speaking and this is
interesting

123
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,530
generally speaking be at baseball
football whatever the network's try to

124
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:26,630
cover the national anthem they try to be
in commercial I've heard it in my ear

125
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,440
where the producer says wait a minute
they may still be in the anthem when we

126
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,050
come out of this commercial and
sometimes they are and then you're just

127
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,770
quiet for the last few notes and you
note that the anthem has concluded now

128
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,600
people want to see the anthem they're
interested in it how long it lasts we'll

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,920
have to wait and see by the way I did
this may this is not as important but in

130
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,030
his comments in Alabama Trump went on to
say that they're ruining the NFL there's

131
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,550
not enough hitting there I guess sisse
fiying the game you wonder how many

132
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,600
times people who believe that have
themselves been hit in the head the

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,800
science is clear and the more that
science emerges the more it will become

134
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,480
clear that football and brain trauma are
linked it doesn't matter how much you

135
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,310
like the game they are linked and to
deny that is to live in a fantasy world

136
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,480
when you hear people say that sports is
about entertainment sports it is about

137
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,540
distraction sports is about something
other than politics politics shouldn't

138
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:32,540
be in sports largely true but sometimes
they intersect inevitably and to ignore

139
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,150
it is to ignore the elephant in the room
when I commented about various issues

140
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,130
only occasionally on NBC being on
football or during the Olympics it was

141
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,060
never during the action it was never at
the expense of the action and the drama

142
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,470
it was always in a little niche that was
carved out when nothing else was going

143
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,450
on in terms of the game itself but you
have to acknowledge these things and you

144
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,730
have to address them they're important
and very often because sports appeals

145
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,290
across demographic lines like nothing
else we live in a niche world but the

146
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,780
one thing that draws not only a large
audio

147
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,040
but a varied audience outside of the
Academy Awards in the Emmys I guess the

148
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,240
one thing that draws that kind of
across-the-board interest is big sports

149
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,410
events and and very often that's where
these issues play themselves out I heard

150
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,230
a little bit of relevant history
yesterday that I think is important to

151
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,940
just reiterate and that is that before
2009 the players often worked on the

152
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,130
field for the national anthem something
changed and patriotism became a larger

153
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,930
component of all this sometimes paid
patriotism yeah and so yesterday what

154
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,290
did you think of the teams that stayed
in the locker room for the national

155
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,380
anthem they released statement saying we
believe in patriotism we believe in our

156
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,290
flag and we believe in our first
responders that they stayed in a locker

157
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,690
room
what did you I was ok with it I think

158
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,940
what Mike Tomlin said the coach of the
Steelers made a lot of sense so we don't

159
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,020
want our players to have to choose they
may feel one way they may feel another

160
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,020
they may be apolitical so we'll stay off
villanueva one of the players for the

161
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,920
Steelers who was an Army Ranger in
Afghanistan came out of the locker room

162
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,430
and stood at the edge of the field not
on the field but sort of at the at the

163
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,750
lip of the runway that would lead to the
field with his hand over his heart and

164
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,170
that was his decision to make and I
would respect that to what cross the

165
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,670
line specifically do you think what
broke the dam here

166
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:32,600
well would you call people's sons of
bitches across the board that offends

167
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,210
everybody white and black they've stood
shoulder-to-shoulder on those fields in

168
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,080
those locker rooms what kind of a
statement is that to make and I don't

169
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,480
think it's irrelevant that clearly the
President had more passion and

170
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,770
conviction for those remarks than he did
when he finally got around after

171
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:58,700
equivocating to distancing himself to
some extent from white nationalists and

172
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,460
neo-nazis you he clearly had more fervor
for this than for that it's one thing to

173
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,330
take a knee or raise a fist it's your
right and there's a point here to be

174
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,320
made but I hope others follow
Kaepernick's lead not in some of the

175
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,010
naive political statements he's
occasionally made but in getting

176
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:21,410
involved in the community and actually
doing things which many NFL players

177
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,380
already do
but it's just not spotlighted it's not

178
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,089
just the NFL NBA Major League Baseball
whatever it may be and I think it would

179
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:34,310
the reason why Kaepernick is an
imperfect messenger is that you think

180
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,459
about Muhammad Ali a different time and
of course he was a transcendent figure

181
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,579
and he was so entertaining even when he
was polarizing people couldn't take

182
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:45,589
their eyes off him he was so charismatic
and magnetic but you need people out

183
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:51,440
there articulating as a few did this
weekend out there articulating we love

184
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,089
our country we support the military we
know that most policemen not only are

185
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:00,050
not guilty of misbehavior
but many of them are heroic and

186
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,279
dedicated many of them are themselves
African America merican or Hispanic and

187
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,959
they're dedicated to protecting and
serving people of all backgrounds we get

188
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,149
that but there is still a problem and it
and that problem a police brutality

189
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:19,970
specifically is real it's true it's
urgent and because it it's connected

190
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:27,019
historically to the mistreatment of
African Americans by government by the

191
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,120
justice system and by the police because
it's connected it resonates all the more

192
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,029
if people can make those distinctions
and voice those distinctions rather than

193
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:41,060
just kneeling or rather than just
raising a fist then then the

194
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,260
conversations really on and I hope it
goes there it's hard to say all of what

195
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,560
you just said on Twitter which is I
think one of the problems right now yeah

196
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,889
that's my ship in this country that's
right it's a complicated and portable

197
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,250
discussion the world that plays its
discussions out on social media is not a

198
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,790
world of texture and nuance now Bob
Costas thank you for being part of the

199
00:14:58,790 --> 00:00:00,000
conversation with us thank you all
