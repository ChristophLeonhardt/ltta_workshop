TO ORLANDO, FLORIDA, WHERE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP LANDED A SHORT 
TIME AGO, AND HE IS THERE TO 
SPEAK WITH A HOST OF POLICE 
CHIEFS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. 
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE HE IS 
GREETING GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT, 
WHO HAS PLENTY ON HIS PLATE AS 
THEY PREPARE FOR HURRICANE 
MICHAEL. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS APPROACHING 
THE PODIUM NOW. 
LET'S LISTEN IN NOW. 
>> YOU CAN SIT. 
IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. 
AND I WANT TO THANK CHIEF 
DEKMAR FOR THE WONDERFUL 
INTRODUCTION AND FOR YOUR 
LIFETIME OF DISTINGUISHED 
SERVICE. 
A VERY SPECIAL FRIEND OF MINE. 
I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE IN THE 
GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA, WITH 
THE INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
ON BEHALF OF ALL AMERICANS I 
WANT TO EXPRESS OUR ETERNAL 
GRATITUDE FOR WHAT YOU DO EVERY 
SINGLE DAY TO PROTECT OUR 
FAMILIES, DEFEND OUR STREETS, 
AND TAKE DOWN CRIMINALS. 
AND WHAT YOU DO IS KEEP AMERICA 
SAFE. 
AND NOBODY DOES IT BETTER THAN 
YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
  
THANK YOU. 
AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR 
AMAZING FAMILIES. 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT 
THEM YOU COULDN'T DO IT. 
AND THEY'RE HERE, AND THEY ARE 
INDEED FANTASTIC PEOPLE. 
SO THANK YOU TO THE FAMILIES. 
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. 
 
WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED 
TODAY BY A TRUE FRIEND OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, GOVERNOR RICK 
SCOTT. 
AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT RICK 
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE WHEN IT 
COMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
ANYTIME YOU NEED FUNDS FROM THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, HE'S ON THE 
PHONE. 
MR. PRESIDENT, WE NEED MORE 
FUNDS. 
WHAT'S IT FOR THIS TIME, RICK? 
IT'S FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
AND I SAY YOU GOT THEM. 
AND SPEAKING OF THAT. 
YOU GOT THEM. 
 
YOU GOT THEM. 
WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT WANTS IT, 
THEY'RE REASONABLE. 
THEY WANT IT, AND WHAT YOU DO 
IS SO INCREDIBLE. 
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY RICK IS A 
TREMENDOUS GOVERNOR, AND HE IS 
YOUR BIGGEST FAN. 
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
AND ALSO, ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR 
BIG FANS, I WILL TELL YOU THAT 
IS ATTORNEY GENERAL, PAM BONDY 
WHO IS WITH US TODAY. 
AND THANK YOU, PAM. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WHEREVER YOU MAY BE. 
SHE'S IN THIS BIG ROOM, SOME 
PLACE. 
THANK YOU. 
INCREDIBLE WOMAN. 
THANK YOU AS WELL TO OUR DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN 
FOR BEING HERE. 
FLEW DOWN TOGETHER. 
THE PRESS WANTS TO KNOW WHAT 
DID YOU TALK ABOUT. 
BUT WE HAD A VERY GOOD TALK, I 
WILL SAY. 
THAT BECAME A VERY BIG STORY, 
ACTUALLY, FOLKS. 
WE HAD A GOOD TALK. 
AS HURRICANE MICHAEL NEARS 
LANDFALL, WE ARE WORKING WITH 
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS IN 
FLORIDA TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY 
PRECAUTIONS AND WE URGE ALL 
RESIDENTS TO BE PREPARED AND TO 
HEED LOCAL OFFICIALS. 
I TOLD RICK SCOTT THAT WE'RE 
READY FOR YOU. 
WE HAVE ALREADY BRIEFED FEMA, 
AND FEMA'S GETTING PREPARED, 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG ONE. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 
IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER BIG ONE. 
BUT WE'VE HANDLED THEM WELL. 
WE'VE HANDLED THEM VERY WELL. 
AND THAT INCLUDES THE ONE THAT 
JUST LEFT US IN FLORIDA. 
IT NEVER ENDS. 
BUT WE'RE ALL PREPARED, AND 
HOPEFULLY IT WON'T BE AS BAD AS 
IT'S LOOKING. 
IT LOOKED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO 
LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE MUCH, 
AND NOW IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT 
COULD BE A BIG ONE. 
I WANT TO ALSO EXTEND MY THANKS 
TO ORLANDO CHIEF JOHN MINA AND 
THE ENTIRE ORLANDO POLICE 
DEPARTMENT FOR HOSTING US IN 
THIS GREAT CITY. 
JOHN, WHERE IS JOHN? 
THANK YOU, JOHN. 
GREAT JOB. 
GREAT CITY. 
SAFE CITY TOO, JOHN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
GREAT JOB. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE BOARD 
OF IACP AND CONGRATULATIONS TO 
YOUR INCOMING PRESIDENT CHIEF 
PAUL SELL. 
WHERE IS CHIEF? 
GOOD CHIEF. 
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE 
CHIEF. 
I KNOW THE CHIEF. 
THAT MEANS I GUESS I HAVE TO BE 
HERE NEXT YEAR, CHIEF, IS THAT 
RIGHT? 
LOOKING LIKE THAT, RIGHT? 
IT'S OKAY. 
FOR YOU GUYS, ANYTHING I CAN DO 
I'LL DO. 
VERY IMPORTANTLY --  
I WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS FROM 
AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE 
TRAVELED HERE TO SHARE THEIR 
EXPERIENCE, AND TO STRENGTHEN 
THE FINAL COOPERATION THAT WE 
ALL PRACTICE TOGETHER. 
WE HAVE GREAT, GREAT 
COOPERATION ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
WE DEEPLY VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP 
AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP. 
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCHER FOR  
-- VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. 
THANK YOU. 
 
THIS YEAR, WE PROUDLY CELEBRATE 
THE 125th ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
CHIEFS OF POLICE. 
IT'S A GREAT GROUP. 
TODAY I STAND BEFORE YOU AS 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
TO TELL YOU THAT MY 
ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS 
HONOR, CHERISH, AND SUPPORT THE 
MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE, AND WE 
ARE PROUD TO DO IT. 
 
WORKING TOGETHER WE HAVE 
ACHIEVED EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS 
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST VIOLENT 
CRIME. 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT REDUCING 
CRIME BEGINS WITH RESPECTING 
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
FOR TOO MANY YEARS, WE HAVE 
WATCHED POLITICIANS ESCALATE 
POLITICAL ATTACKS ON OUR 
COURAGEOUS POLICE OFFICERS. 
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN IT MORE 
THAN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. 
IT'S DISGRACEFUL. 
POLITICIANS WHO SPREAD THIS 
DANGEROUS ANTI-POLICE SENTIMENT 
MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR CRIMINALS, 
AND MORE DANGEROUS FOR LAW-
ABIDING CITIZENS. 
 
AND THEY ALSO MAKE IT MORE 
DANGEROUS FOR POLICE. 
AND IT MUST STOP, AND IT MUST 
STOP NOW. 
BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE LESS THAN 
TWO YEARS AGO, OUR NATION WAS 
EXPERIENCING A HISTORIC SURGE 
IN VIOLENT CRIME. 
IN 2015, 2016, ADDITIONAL 
128,000 VIOLENT CRIMES WERE 
COMMITTED NATIONWIDE COMPARED 
TO THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS. 
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF 
ADDITIONAL CRIME. 
OVER THE SAME PERIOD, WE 
WITNESSED THE STEEPEST TWO YEAR 
CONSECUTIVE INCREASE IN MURDERS 
IN NEARLY HALF A CENTURY. 
BUT WE ARE TURNING THAT TIDE 
AROUND VERY RAPIDLY, AS YOU ALL 
KNOW IN THIS ROOM. 
WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR STREETS 
FROM DRUG LORDS, GANGS, AND 
CRIMES. 
WE ARE BEING TOUGH. 
WE'RE BEING SMART. 
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR MURDERS 
IN MAJOR CITIES ARE ESTIMATED 
TO DROP BY CLOSE TO 10% FROM 
THEIR LEVELS IN 2016. 
AND I HAVE DIRECTED THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO 
IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE GREAT 
CITY OF CHICAGO TO HELP 
STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TERRIBLE 
SHOOTING WAVE. 
WE WANT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT 
FAST. 
THERE'S NO REASON FOR WHAT'S 
GOING ON THERE. 
 
I'VE TOLD THEM TO WORK WITH 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TRY TO 
CHANGE THE TERRIBLE DEAL THE 
CITY OF CHICAGO ENTERED INTO 
WITH ACLU, WHICH TIES LAW 
ENFORCEMENT'S HANDS. 
AND TO STRONGLY CONSIDER STOP 
AND FRISK. 
IT WORKS AND WAS MEANT FOR 
PROBLEMS LIKE CHICAGO. 
IT WAS MEANT FOR IT. 
STOP AND FRISK. 
 
AND RUDY GIULIANI WHEN HE WAS 
MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY HAD A 
VERY STRONG PROGRAM OF STOP AND 
FRISK AND IT WENT FROM AN 
UNACCEPTABLY DANGEROUS CITY TO 
ONE OF THE SAFEST CITIES IN THE 
COUNTRY, AND I THINK THE SAFEST 
BIG CITY IN THE COUNTRY, SO IT 
WORKS. 
GOT TO BE SAFELY APPLIED, BUT 
STOP AND FRISK WORKS. 
THE CRIME SPREE IS A TERRIBLE 
BLIGHT ON THAT CITY, AND WE'LL 
DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET 
IT DONE. 
I KNOW THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PEOPLE IN CHICAGO, AND I KNOW 
HOW GOOD THEY ARE. 
THEY COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF 
THEY WERE SIMPLY ALLOWED TO DO 
THEIR JOB, AND DO THEIR JOB 
PROPERLY, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY 
WANT TO DO. 
SO CHICAGO, WE'RE GOING TO 
START WORKING WITH YOU, AS OF 
TODAY. 
 
THANK YOU. 
IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018, MY 
ADMINISTRATION BROUGHT CHARGES 
AGAINST MORE FEDERAL FIREARM 
DEFENDANTS, AND MORE VIOLENT 
CRIMINALS THAN EVER BEFORE IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
AND TO HELP FORMER INMATES 
BECOME LAW-ABIDING AND 
PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY, 
WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON A PRISON 
REFORM BILL. 
VERY, VERY BIG AND 
COMPREHENSIVE ONE. 
AND THE BEST THING THAT COULD 
HAPPEN, I THINK WE'VE ALREADY 
DONE. 
WE HAVE RECORD NUMBERS OF JOBS 
RIGHT NOW IN THE UNITED STATES. 
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME WHERE 
MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN OUR 
COUNTRY THAN RIGHT NOW. 
 
AND OUR UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS IN 
ALMOST EVERY CATEGORY ARE AT 
RECORD LOWS. 
THEY ARE RECORD LOWS. 
AFRICAN AMERICAN, BEST IN 
HISTORY. 
ASIAN AMERICAN, BEST IN 
HISTORY. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN, BEST IN 
HISTORY. 
WE ARE DOING INCREDIBLY WELL AS 
AN ECONOMY, AND THAT'S A GREAT 
THING WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISON, 
UNABLE TO GET A JOB. 
TOTALLY UNABLE TO GET A JOB. 
IT'S A HOPELESS SITUATION. 
NOW THEY'RE GETTING JOBS TO A 
CERTAIN EXTENT, AND TO A LARGE 
EXTENT, BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SO 
WELL. 
EMPLOYERS ARE FORCED TO TAKE 
PEOPLE THAT THEY MAY BE 
WOULDN'T HAVEDONE, AND SOME OF 
THOSE EMPLOYERS GET BACK TO ME, 
AND SAY MR. PRESIDENTS, IT'S 
AMAZING HOW GOOD THESE PEOPLE 
ARE. 
NOT ALL OF THEM. 
NOT ALL OF ANYBODY OR ANY 
CATEGORY IS GOING TO BE GREAT. 
BUT TREMENDOUS RESPONSE. 
AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN A SECOND, OR EVEN IN SOME 
CASES A THIRD SHOT AT IT, AND 
THEY'RE DOING REALLY WELL. 
SO THE ECONOMY BEING SO GREAT, 
AND THE JOBS PICTURING ABOUT -- 
PICTURE BEING SO STRONG, PEOPLE 
ARE GETTING A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY. 
I JUST WANT TO THANK LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
IT'S A GREAT THING. 
AND IN PARTICULAR, I HAVE TO 
THANK THE IACP FOR WORKING WITH 
US ON THIS EFFORT, AND FOR 
ENDORSING IMPORTANT PRISON 
REFORM LEGISLATION ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRY, AND WE'RE DOING 
FEDERAL LEGISLATION, BUT ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY. 
YOU FOLKS HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC. 
EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY 
ADMINISTRATION WE WILL STAND 
FOR LAW, ORDER, AND JUSTICE. 
JUST TWO DAYS AGO THE SENATE 
CONFIRMED A SUPREMELY QUALIFIED 
NOMINEE WHO WILL BE A FAITHFUL 
DEFENDER OF THE RULE OF LAW. 
 
AND WILL DEFEND THE UNITED 
STATES CONSTITUTION. 
THE NEWEST SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE, BRETT KAVANAUGH 
 
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I 
DECIDED ON BRETT, AND WE HAVE 
TREMENDOUS TALENT IN OUR LEGAL 
SYSTEM. 
BUT I DECIDED ON BRETT. 
I SAID HE'S FLAWLESS. 
A FLAWLESS PERSON. 
THE BEST STUDENT. 
A GREAT SCHOLAR. 
INCREDIBLE RECORD OVER MANY 
YEARS, AND YET HE'S A YOUNG 
MAN. 
I SAID BRETT, CONGRATULATIONS, 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A PIECE OF 
CAKE GET YOU CONFIRMED. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE SO EASY. 
IT SHOULD GO QUICKLY, NICELY. 
DON'T EVEN WORRY. 
HE WAS SO THANKFUL. 
HE SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS 
THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. 
THE GREATEST OF MY LIFE. 
SO I HAVEN'T HEARD HIM SAY THAT 
AGAIN TO ME. 
BUT HE'S A GREAT PERSON, AND IT 
WAS VERY, VERY UNFAIR WHAT 
HAPPENED TO HIM. 
FALSE CHARGES. 
FALSE ACCUSATIONS. 
HORRIBLE STATEMENTS THAT WERE 
TOTALLY UNTRUE, THAT HE KNEW 
NOTHING ABOUT. 
FRANKLY TERMS THAT HE HAD NEVER 
HEARD IN HIS LIFE. 
HE WAS THIS, HE WAS THAT. 
HE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THESE 
TERMS. 
WAS A DISGRACEFUL SITUATION, 
BROUGHT ABOUT PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE EVIL, AND HE TOUGHED IT 
OUT. 
WE ALL TOUGHED IT OUT TOGETHER. 
WE HAVE TO THANK THE REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS THAT FOUGHT SO HARD 
FOR THIS, BECAUSE IT WASN'T 
EASY, AND IT WAS A GREAT HONOR 
TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS 
SITUATION. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE  
SAID LET'S GIVE IT UP, LET'S GO 
IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION. 
WE DON'T GIVE UP. 
YOU DON'T GIVE UP. 
JUST DON'T DO IT. 
HE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
WATCH. 
A GREAT ONE. 
HE WILL BE A GREAT ONE. 
WE WILL PERFORM THE SWEARING IN 
TONIGHT AT 7:00 P.M. 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THAT'S A VERY EXCITING. 
SO I LEAVE HERE, AND I GO HOME, 
AND I SWEAR IN A MAN WHO WILL 
BE A TRULY GREAT UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, THAT'S 
GOING TO BE MY HONOR. 
THANK YOU. 
I'M GOING TO TELL HIM ABOUT THE 
SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE BEFORE I 
EVEN FINISH YOU PEOPLE. 
BECAUSE YOU KNEW WHAT I WAS 
ABOUT TO SAY, AND I DIDN'T SAY 
IT AND YOU STARTED BEFORE I 
COMPLETED. 
THAT'S THE KIND OF, THAT'S ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY, I'M DOING 
RALLIES, AND PEOPLE ARE LOVING 
THAT MAN, AND LOVING THAT 
CHOICE, SO I THINK WE'RE ALL 
GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY IN ORDER 
TO KEEP EVERY AMERICAN SAFE WE 
ARE ALSO MAKING OFFICER SAFETY 
A TOP PRIORITY. 
IN 2016, AN OFFICER WAS 
ASSAULTED IN AMERICA AN AVERAGE 
OF EVERY 9 MINUTES. 
11 OFFICERS WERE SHOT IN 
FLORENCE,  KILLED AND
NUMEROUS INJURED.
OUR HEARTS BREAK
FOR THE FAMILY OF
FALLEN OFFICER,
CARAWAY.
WE PRAY FOR HIS
LOVED ONES AND
THOSE OFFICERS
STILL RECOVERING.
WHEN AN OFFICER
IS ASSAULTED OR
KILLED IT'S A
WOUND INFLICTED
UPON OUR ENTIRE
NATION.
>> AND I HAVE TO
SAY THIS, I DON'T
THINK YOU
UNDERSTAND ONE
THING, HOW MUCH
OUR COUNTRY LOVES
YOU AND THE JOB
YOU DO.
YOU DON'T HEAR IT
FROM THEM.
>> YOU DON'T HEAR
IT FROM THEM.
>> THEY DON'T
TELL YOU THE REAL
FEELING.
[CHEERS AND
APPLAUSE]
>> THEY DON'T
TELL YOU THE TRUE
FEELING BUT I
KNOW THE TRUE
FEELING.
I KNOW THE TRUE
FEELING.
YOU DON'T HEAR IT
FROM THE MEDIA,
BUT I CAN TELL
YOU I KNOW THE
FEELING, AND
THESE PEOPLE --
THE PEOPLE OF OUR
COUNTRY LOVE YOU.
SO I JUST WANT
YOU TO KNOW IT
DIRECT.
THANK YOU, THANK
YOU.
[CHEERS AND
APPLAUSE]
>> THANK YOU.
I LOVE HIM TOO.
HE'S JUST NOT MY
TYPE.
I'M SORRY.
>>
>> HE'S NOT MY
TYPE.
THANK YOU.
ONE OF MY VERY
FIRST ACTIONS AS
PRESIDENT WAS TO
DIRECT MY
ADMINISTRATION TO
TAKE ALL
NECESSARY ACTION
TO PROTECT LAW
ENFORCEMENT FROM
ACTS OF VIOLENCE
AGAINST ALL OF
YOU.
WE BELIEVE THAT
CRIMINALS WHO
KILL OUR POLICE
OFFICERS SHOULD
IMMEDIATELY WITH
TRIAL, BUT
RAPIDLY AS
POSSIBLE, NOT 15
YEARS LATER, 20
YEARS LATER, GET
THE DEATH
PENALTY.
[CHEERS AND
APPLAUSE]
>> AND
IMPORTANTLY WE
ARE ALSO MAKING
SURE YOU HAVE THE
EQUIPMENT YOU
NEED TO DO THE
JOB.
[CHEERS AND
APPLAUSE]
>> THAT'S WHY WE
ARE ALLOWING
LOCAL POLICE TO
ACCESS SURPLUS
MILITARY
EQUIPMENT.
>> WE'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FROM
THE FIRST DAY OF
MY
ADMINISTRATION.
WHERE OTHERS
DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE THAT
EQUIPMENT FOR
VERY STRANGE
REASONS.
>>
>> THEY SAID THEY
LOOK TOO TOUGH.
THEY LOOK TOO
STRONG.
IT'S NOT A GOOD
LOOK.
PEOPLE ARE
SHOOTING AT YOU
AND THEY'RE
WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR LOOK.
SOME DAY YOU'LL
EXPLAIN THAT ONE
TO ME, PLEASE.
I DON'T QUITE GET
IT.
[CHEERS AND
APPLAUSE]
>> EXPLAIN IT.
THIS EQUIPMENT
DOESN'T ONLY
PROTECT YOUR
LIVES AND SAFETY,
IT PROJECTS THE
LIVES AND SAFETY
OF EVERY CITIZEN
THAT YOU SERVE.
DURING HURRICANE
HARVEY, SURPLUS
MILITARY
EQUIPMENT HELPED
RESCUE MORE THAN
9,000 PEOPLE.
>> WE ARE ALSO
TAKING
UNPRECEDENTED
ACTION TO HELP
OUR LOCAL POLICE
FIGHT THE WORST
DRUG EPIDEMIC IN
OUR HISTORY.
THE OPIOID CRISIS
WHICH TOOK NEARLY
50,000 AMERICAN
LIVES LAST YEAR.
WE HAVE SECURED
THE MOST FUNDING
IN HISTORY TO
GIVE YOU THE
TOOLS YOU NEED TO
HUNT DOWN THE
TRAFFICKERS AND
STOP THESE POISON
US DRUGS FROM
COMING INTO OUR
COUNTRY.
I'M ANNOUNCING
$42.4 MILLION FOR
THE HIGH
INTENSITY DRUG
TRAFFICKING AREAS
PROGRAM TO ATTACK
THIS EPIDEMIC.
>> THIS GRAND
FUNDING WILL GO
TO MORE THAN 50
INNOVATVE
PROJECTS
TARGETING THE
GREATEST DRUG
THREATS FACING
THE UNITED
STATES.
AND I WILL TELL
YOU THAT LAST
YEAR IN THE
BUDGET, THIS
YEAR, ALSO LAST
YEAR WE GOT $6
BILLION -- $6
BILLION TO WORK
ON THE OPIOID
PROBLEM AT EVERY
LEVEL.
INCLUDING HELPING
PEOPLE, REALLY
HELPING PEOPLE
THAT ARE IN NEED
OF HELP.
LAST YEAR WE
INCREASED THE
AVERAGE FEDERAL
SENTENCE FOR DRUG
TRAFFICKING TO
ITS HIGHEST LEVEL
SINCE 2013.
FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN YEARS,
WE'RE ENSURING
THERE ARE REAL
TOUGH
CONSEQUENCES FOR
THOSE WHO FLOOD
OUR STREETS WITH
DEADLY POISON.
THANKS TO YOUR
PARTNERSHIP, LAST
YEAR OUR BRAVE,
ICE AGENTS SEIZED
1 MILLION POUNDS
OF NARCOTICS
INCLUDING ALMOST
7,000 POUNDS OF
HEROIN AND MORE
THAN 2,300 POUNDS
OF FENTANYL,
SAVING THOUSANDS
UPON THOUSANDS OF
AMERICAN LIVES.
AND THIS YEAR
WE'RE WAY AHEAD
OF THOSE NUMBERS.
LAST YEAR ALONE,
ICE REMOVED
NEARLY 130,000
CRIMINAL ALIENS
FROM OUR COUNTRY.
AND AS YOU KNOW
MY COMPETITORS
DON'T LIKE THAT.
THEY DON'T LIKE
THAT.
THAT'S THE OTHER
THING YOU HAVE TO
EXPLAIN TO ME
SOME DAY.
INCLUDING
THOUSANDS OF
VICIOUS GANG
MEMBERS AND MS 13
PREDATORS,
THEY'RE GONE.
>> THEY'RE GONE.
YET THESE BRAVE
ICE OFFICERS HAVE
BEEN SUBJECTED TO
SHAMELESS ATTACKS
BY LEADING
MEMBERS OF THE
DEMOCRAT PARTY
INCLUDING
OUTRAGEOUS CALLS
TO ABOLISH ICE,
AND ALSO THEY'RE
NOT A BIG HELP TO
US IN LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
THEY DON'T WANT
TO GIVE US THE
KIND OF FUNDS YOU
PEOPLE ARE
REQUESTING, BUT
YOU'RE GETTING
THEM ANYWAY
BECAUSE WE'RE
GIVING THEM TO
YOU, BUT THEY
FIGHT US AT EVERY
TURN.
THE DEMOCRATS
FIGHT US AT EVERY
SINGLE TURN
WHETHER IT'S LAW
ENFORCEMENT OR
MILITARY, THEY
FIGHT US AT EVERY
TURN BUT WE WIN.
WE CONDEMN THE
VILLA FICATION
WITH LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND
WE STAND WITH
BORDER PATROL AND
LAW ENFORCEMENT
IN GENERAL.
WE ALSO STRONGLY
OPPOSE EFFORTS
FROM POLITICIANS
TO SHACKLE LOCAL
POLICE
DEPARTMENTS AND
PREVENT THEM FROM
COOPERATING WITH
THEIR FEDERAL
PARTNER, SO LET'S
SEE WHETHER OR
NOT CHICAGO AS AN
EXAMPLE LOCALLY
ACCEPTS HELP.
THEY NEED IT.
WE'LL STRAIGHTEN
IT OUT FAST.
WE'RE GOING TO
STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
FAST.
I ASSUME THEY
WANT TO
STRAIGHTEN IT
OUT.
SOMETIMES I THINK
MAYBE IS IT
POSSIBLE THEY
DON'T.
BUT WE'RE GOING
TO BE THERE.
WE'RE GOING TO
TRY AND HELP
THEM.
EVERY DAY THESE
SANCTUARY CITY
POLICIES FORCE
THE RELEASE OF
CRIMINAL ALIENS
AND GANG MEMBERS
RIGHT BACK ONTO
OUR STREETS.
PUTTING INNOCENT
CIVILIANS AT
GRAVE RISK, MANY
PEOPLE BEING
KILLED.
I WILL FIGHT
EVERYDAY FOR YOUR
RIGHT TO
COOPERATE WITH
FEDERAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND
TO PROTECT YOUR
COMMUNITIES AS
YOU WISH AND I
KNOW MOST OF YOU
IN THIS ROOM, I
THINK PROBABLY
EVERYBODY IN THIS
ROOM WORKS
BRILLIANTLY WITH
OUR FEDERAL
AUTHORITIES, AND
IT'S OUR HONOR TO
DO IT INCLUDING
FUNDING BY THE
WAY, INCLUDING
FUNDING.
THANK YOU.
>> LAST WEEK, MY
ADMINISTRATION
ALSO PROVIDED
HISTORIC LEVELS
OF FUNDING TO
IMPROVE SCHOOL
SAFETY THROUGH
STOP SCHOOL
VIOLENCE GRANTS,
WE'RE GIVING
LOCAL SCHOOLS AND
POLICE
DEPARTMENTS THE
RESOURCES THEY
NEED TO HIRE MORE
OFFICERS AND
TRAIN MORE
TEACHERS AND
BETTER DETECT AND
ADDRESS EARLY
WARNING SIGNS OF
MENTAL ILLNESS
BEFORE IT'S TOO
LATE.
I MADE A LOT OF
STRIDES IN THE
LAST YEAR.
>> HEAVY FUNDING
BUT YOU'VE MADE A
LOT OF STRIDES.
IN EVERY ACTION
WE TAKE, WE ARE
DEFENDING
AMERICAN SAFETY
AND TREASURY, THE
EXTRAORDINARY --
I MEAN WE'RE
HELPING AS MANY
MEN AND WOMEN WHO
PROTECT OUR
COMMUNITIES.
HERE WITH US

TAYLOR?
COME ON UP HERE,
TAYLOR.
RUN UP HERE.
THEY'LL LET YOU

>> A YEAR AGO,
TAYLOR RACED TO
THE SCENE OF AN
ACTIVE SHOOTER IN
A NEIGHBORHOOD,
ENTERED THE HOUSE
WITHOUT ANY
BACKUP AT ALL,
AND SHOT AND
KILLED A MURDER.
IT TURNED OUT TO
BE SOMEONE WITH A
BAD PAST, SAVING
THE LIVES OF FOUR
CIVILIANS.
OFFICER RUST, WE
SALUTE YOU AND
YOUR REMARKABLE
COURAGE.
YOU'RE AN
INCREDIBLE
GENTLEMAN.
STAY UP HERE WITH
ME.
COME ON.
SAY A COUPLE OF
WORDS.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
YOU'LL HAVE TO
FORGIVE ME.
I'M MUCH MORE
COMFORTABLE IN
THE SITUATION,
THAT THE
PRESIDENT
DESCRIBED THAN
BEING HERE UP.
IT'S A TREMENDOUS
HONOR FOR ME TO
BE HERE.
I APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING ICAP
HAS DONE FOR ME,
MY FAMILY AND MY
WIFE AMBER IS
HERE.
SHE'S BEEN A
TREMENDOUS
SUPPORT AS WELL
THROUGH THIS
WHOLE THING.
>> IT HAS BEEN A
HUMBLING
EXPERIENCE FOR ME
AND IT'S AN HONOR
TO BE SPOKEN IN
THE SAME BREATH
AS THE OTHER
OFFICERS SITTING
OVER THERE.
THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
>> THAT WAS A
GOOD JOB.
HE'S RUNNING FOR
OFFICE SOON, YOU
WATCH.
THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
LAST MAY, OFFICER
MARK DALLAS WAS
ON DUTY AT DIXON
HIGH SCHOOL IN
ILLINOIS WHEN HE
HEARD GUNSHOTS.
WITHIN, LISTEN TO
THIS, THREE
SECONDS, HE WAS
AT THE SCENE
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE
AUDITORIUM WHERE
THE ENTIRE SENIOR
CLASS WAS
GATHERED AND WAS
IN A LOT OF
TROUBLE.
THE SHOOTER FLED
AND FIRED SHOTS
AT HIM.
BUT OFFICER
DALLAS CHASED HIM
DOWN BEFORE A
SINGLE STUDENT
WAS INJURED.
OFFICER DALLAS'
SON JOSHUA --
>> -- WAS ONE OF
THE SENIORS
INSIDE OF THAT
AUDITORIUM.
AFTERWARDS JOSHUA
SAID, I WASN'T
SCARED FOR MY
LIFE AT ALL
BECAUSE I KNEW MY
DAD WOULD PROTECT
US.
HOW GOOD THAT IS
THAT?
>> THANK YOU
OFFICER DALLAS.
WHERE ARE YOU?úCOME UP HERE.
THAT'S PRETTY
GOOD.
>> THAT'S PRETTY
GOOD.
SO HIS SON HAD A
LITTLE CONFIDENCE
IN HIM.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL STORY.
>> THANK YOU.
>> PUBLIC
SPEAKING IS NOT
MY BEST, BUT I'M
EXTREMELY
NERVOUS,
MR. PRESIDENT.
I APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING, THE
SUPPORT YOU GIVE
US AND I'M
HONORED TO BE
HERE WITH ICAP
AND THE OTHER
NOMINEES AND MY
SON SAID HE
WASN'T SCARED
BECAUSE DAD WAS
OUT THERE.
I WAS DAD TO 128
OTHER KIDS IN
THAT GYMNASIUM.
>> I WANT TO SAY
THANK YOU.
I'M HONORED AND
BLESSED TO BE
HERE.
>> BEAUTIFUL
STORY.
THANK YOU.
>> THAT'S A
BEAUTIFUL STORY.
AND YOUR SON WAS
RIGHT.
IN OCTOBER OF
LAST YEAR,
WASHINGTON STATE
TROOPER NATHANIEL
DAWSON PURSUED A
CAR THAT VIOLATED
A TRAFFIC LAW.
WHEN THE CAR
STOPPED, TWO
GUNMAN BEGAN
SHOOTING AT
TROOPER DAWSON.
AND SHOOTING VERY
VIOLENTLY.
DESPITE HEAVY
FIRE, TROOPER
DAWSON GOT OUT OF
HIS VEHICLE, AND
FIRED BACK UNTIL
THE SHOOTERS RAN
AWAY AND WERE
LATER
APPREHENDED.
THEY WERE VERY
DANGEROUS
CRIMINALS.
OUR STREETS ARE
SAFER, AND OUR
CRIMINALS RECOIL
IN FEAR BECAUSE
OF BRAVE OFFICERS
LIKE TROOPER
DAWSON, AND I
WANT TO THANK
YOU.
COME UP, PLEASE.
TROOPER DAWSON.
>> WELL, IT'S A
GREAT HONOR TO BE
HERE TONIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR ALL
COMING,
MR. PRESIDENT.
I THINK WE ALL
WOULD SAY THE
SAME.
WE'RE DOING OUR
JOB AND TO BE
RECOGNIZED IS
JST EXTRA.
SO THANK YOU
AGAIN.
>> THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
>> THESE PEOPLE HAVE A
LOT OF
RESPECT FOR YOU.
THEY DON'T SIT
DOWN WHEN YOU'RE
UP HERE.
THEY HAVE A LOT
OF RESPECT,

>> THAT'S RIGHT.
BEAUTIFUL.
FINALLY, SERGEANT
LOUISE SELIS OF
THE DURAL,
FLORIDA POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
THEY'RE
INCREDIBLE.
A SHOOTER WAS IN
THE LOBBY OF
TRUMP NATIONAL
DURAL.
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING
TO ME AND I
DIDN'T SAY PUT
THIS MAN.
I KNEW WHAT HE
DID.
BUT THEY PUT HIM.
THREATENING A LOT
OF PEOPLE THAT
WERE IN THE HOTEL
INCLUDING THE
EMPLOYEES.
SERGEANT SELIS
ENTERED THE
