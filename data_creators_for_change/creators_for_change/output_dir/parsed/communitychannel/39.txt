have you ever spared a thought for how
awkward Valentine's Day is for bears he
put me out here for this romantic picnic

don't come
the tide is getting high there's so much
pressure when you're the surprise I
would have brushed my ah oh oh I will
leave at least she likes me well that's
great
at least you oh no oh no third wheel but
no I can't see boobs boobs oh oh it was
the chocolates it was just the
chocolates how would you like it if
someone just tattooed stuff on your foot
no one thinks what it's like for last
year's bear this is the worst
this is an area sleep ages ago he's not
going to make his date she's gonna dump
him I'm going to have to live in a man's
house
