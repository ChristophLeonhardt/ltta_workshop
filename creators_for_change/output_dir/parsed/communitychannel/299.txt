hi now why is it when a friends up to
you in Oz pana what hey does this hurt
oh yes honestly if you ever noticed how
people ask you something that is
obviously going to hurt hurts and you
know what's even stranger
the attraction we had to get hurt it's
like what's it what now
chill and you tell me this new trick
totally hurts makes you feel like your
arms burning off stupid try and you know
it's gonna end one of two ways either
this way oh I know right oh it hurts
Philip my third off at which case you
pretty much had it coming otherwise we
do this strange thing where if it
doesn't hurt we ask for it to hurt like
this that doesn't hurt men too
try harder yeah that's good
you guys know what I mean right
otherwise the other option is somebody
will be doing something on you and it
will hurt and you'll pretend it won't
but no that doesn't doesn't hurt at all
but you know I don't know perhaps we
just have this sick fascination with
getting hurt maybe that's just me maybe
that's you and me no oh off topic I'm
pretty stoked
umm I ever celebrated Christmas ever and
my friend did though and she can't go
home unfortunately for Christmas so
she's staying here and so I decided to
have her over and to make him feel more
at home I thought you know I'd get into
the whole festive festive with the hands
thing so I bought all these Christmas
decorations look and I never ever got to
decorate or anything look I got these
these little sparkly things there did a
tree or something um yes so I'm pretty
stoked to get to decorate the house I'm
gonna start that tomorrow and maybe I
can show you guys a little bit of months
to it happening yeah
move over Martha Stewart he's a paddle
pop stick Christmas tree um yeah no that
is all by the way this is a no I won't
ask because that's don't worry all good
and sorry
Wow
I was just gonna ask I have a cat that's
pregnant under my house keeps making
those noises if anyone else had to get
rid of pregnant cats let me know
yes Hamish playing should be all over
this by now he's not I like that very
music when I was funny and the odds are
how I speak man let it go I don't know
what that last comment meant and I think
someone should just tell Edward Cullen
that he's a bad character I think sorry
Janie Twilight fans
I thought this was a really cute story
because it's the kind of stuff that I
would do that was a funny video
okay bye LA lights thanks for thinking
that I have huge boob man like this I
actually kind of get you got that and
look they're okay they're not that good
they're okay
