now to an exclusive on the beat tonight the man who some say was Trump's michael cohen before michael cohen is here to talk to us he might put it differently but Jay Goldberg did predict on the beat that Cohen was likely to flip over the legal fees and pressure he faced he decided at someone Michael Cohen is someone who was always talking about even stories and links to the MA this was his Trump world is possibly turning on all the investigators into Trump world longtime Trump CFO Alan Whitesell Berg well he's cut a deal of sorts in the Cohen case David Packard the head of the National Enquirer has now left the Canadian media company all over the scrutiny on him for what he did with Cohen to pay off multiple women three Trump world associates apparently turning on their boss and there once loyal friend joining me now as I mentioned is Jay Goldberg he was Donald Trump's exclusive litigator for 15 years he also has a new book coming out this winter the courtroom is my theatre my lifelong representation of famous politicians industrialists entertainers men of honor and more and another seasoned attorney Maya Wiley also at the table Jay let's take a look at your prediction which has proven correct in part that Cohen would buckle under the pressure and you also talked about other crimes he might be affiliated with take a look we hear a lot now about potential money laundering and the Mafia why do you think that comes up with Michael Cohen well people involved in the building trades are at the mercy of the mob do you think Michael Cohen's job at times was to keep the mob away from Donald Trump the question is what did he fix and what needed fixing what needed fixing was relations with the mob how did you get it right that he would plea and if you were right about relations with the mob why was that not charged well I said on another program that I couldn't see him after he got his inmate closing and was told to walk down Broadway that there would be inmates clanging their phone cups against the bars saying to him you're gonna be my wife and I didn't think he would have the stomach to risk what really goes on in a prison setting do you think he won't get a real sentence he will get a real sentence only after he provides substantial assistance why don't mob charges why no charges related to the mob well that could be a long-standing investigation conducted by the Southern District they have in the past looked into the building trades and seeing that builders in New York are at the mercy of mobsters who threatened his labor strife in order to unduly burden a builder and a payoff is the order of the day now you like Donald Trump I liked him and I still like him a great deal let me read to you some of his language you talk about the law he said John McGann quote isn't - John Dean style rat it dawn McGann he said he knows all about quote flippers he prays mana for because he wouldn't quote break and he talks a lot about loyalty does that remind you of some of the accused mafiosos that you've ever represented yes that's typical language meanness is that the right language for the president I wouldn't know precedent that I could turn to to say whether it's right or wrong it's correct as far as I can tell and hinge a interview on a word that he used as opposed to another word yeah you think that's not the focus I'm gonna come back to you let me let me bring in Maya for any response well first I would say we actually don't know whether Michael Cohen is getting any kind of a break what he has done is shifted his plea but what and whether there's a cooperation agreement what he's getting in exchange for it we don't know I absolutely agree with mr. Goldberg that the question is whether he has something to offer and the question about what he has to offer related to business dealings that interact with with Russians is something that there's been a lot of news reporting about a long history of Michael Cohen have having relationships with people who appear to be mob connected so that is something we don't know but it's something that I would expect prosecutors to be interested still be looking at it could still be looking at and not necessarily there yet no Jay as you know this story has captivated the entire nation I'm sure you hear from people as you have taken a public role I don't know if you're familiar with Curtis Jackson the the musician fitty cent you heard of him yeah he's a pretty prominent musician and when we were covering this he spoke about this and he agreed with you that the nature of Michael Cohen that who he is would lead to him cutting a deal take a look at that I wonder if you could contrast that analysis with overlaps with yours about the type of person mr. Cohen is and the reports that mr. Manafort also entered some discussions of a plea whether or not it involved cooperating information I think anybody facing a long prison term caves in I can only I can only think of two people Tom I'm the snake Persico and Fat Tony Salerno as the two people who stood up and said 80 years I'll do it and other than that people mafioso or others faced with a long prison term quote cooperate but you must remember this Eric the fact that they're cooperating doesn't ensure that they're telling the truth their role is to win the cooperation of the government so the government tells the judge that you have provided substantial assistance and the judge can go outside the guidelines and give them a more lenient sentence what do you think of mr. stone Roger stone who has sworn up and down he would know cooperate what do you think of him as a as you put it a snake level resistor well I know him because he yeah you know everybody well that's true and David Packer as well but the point is Roger stone is a well-heeled creative guy who if there's a way to put something favoring your client he thinks of it he's a very crafty individual so I he's unique and I can't say where he would come out but as I said before nobody looks at the prison walls and says he can do the time except for the two people I've mentioned hey I'm re Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our You Tube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
