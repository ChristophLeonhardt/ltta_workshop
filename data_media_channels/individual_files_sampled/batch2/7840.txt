earlier this week we learned that the Trump administration down at the border is actually seizing people's passports because they don't think they're American citizens despite their inability to present any evidence that these are not American citizens that's the government but now we have banks doing sort of a version of that with the Bank of America in recent months Bank of America has been accused of freezing or threatening to freeze customers accounts after asking about their legal status in the u.s. in July The Washington Post reported that multiple customers have been locked out of their accounts after Bank of America questioned whether the account holders were u.s. citizens or dual citizens now it's important to note proof of citizenship is not required to open a bank account in the US according to a spokesperson for the Office of the Comptroller of the currency that's the federal agency that supervises branch baking banks are merely required to identify and report suspicious transactions and maintain and update customer information banks do not received any new instructions to collect more information about customers for instance from the Trump administration and it would seem that if their job was to check for suspicious transactions I would say you're probably looking in the wrong direction I would look up CEOs and the corporations but as of right now despite those banks saying either not giving statements or saying nothing has changed many people are saying that they're losing access to their accounts because of questions about their citizenship despite no legal reason for that to happen I mean you might I see your point you want to might want to look at the top for corruption are these companies but in defense of of policies like this a lot of people tap these companies are not Muslim on the T no and so that's why they're not doing it well but if they're foreigners and they've got like you know a bunch of bags and with unmarked bills and they just want to dump them and like we don't say anything drug money goes through banks y'all standard but listen if you haven't already gotten yourself a credit union get one go to one SF fire credit union shout out to all the firemen and people in San Francisco that's where my money is and the credit union do it if you didn't do it after the 2008 crash and the bailout and all that do it now it's absolutely important that we that we boycott these banks and then we actually put our money into our communities and guess they just don't want our money oops yeah yeah their regulations and their laws of governing some of this stuff with these huge banks that we bail out if they get into trouble as Francesca has just said but this strikes me is another arm of a brutal government policy that we're seeing played out and and I don't know that there are apparently any laws to protect protect against this policy being implemented it's ugly that's the only thing I can say and and I would add that it's incredibly scary because if banks are able to do this I mean at a certain point what are your rights worth if you don't have some of the fundamental things required to go about your life like having access to your bank account it's not like I'm locked out of a movie pass that is about as fundamental a thing a person needs to hold down a job to maintain an apartment just to go about their life like if you lose access to your money then you're pretty much done with anything and banks apparently especially under this administration like do you do you believe that they're gonna like Larry Kudlow is gonna look at this and say well I just got to fix this tomorrow it's not gonna happen this is incredibly scary and I want to jump ahead actually to graphic 17 because this is it for me for for this week on t YT and I want to leave you with one more a bit of news in this area the banks and the Trump administration want you to believe that fake birth certificates that's the real scandal or people who have access to bank accounts when they shouldn't is the real scandal that's not the real scandal in this area the real scandal is that a new filing from the Justice Department in the ACLU shows that 497 children remain in US government custody separated from their fam 22 of those children are under the age of five and the parents of the bulk of those children 322 have already been deported so while I am saying that they're still separated from their parents other people the news might say that they're still separated from their parents it is far more accurate to say that they are permanently separated from their parents they will never see their parents again they will never be reunited so the Bank of America can try to make you scared of people who have access to these bank accounts border guards are having their passports taken away who they're really scary you know what's scary is that the government has gotten away with kidnapping permanently literally hundreds of children and for the most part the median the countries moves on to easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is
