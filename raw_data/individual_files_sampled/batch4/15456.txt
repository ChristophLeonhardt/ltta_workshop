here's what Rachel Notley said now just just a reminder I want to show you how tough she was talking seven days earlier when Kinder Morgan said yeah there they're gonna pull out in a month of things aren't fixed take a look premiere horrigan believes he can harrass this project without economic consequences for British Columbia there he is wrong we will be bringing forward legislation in coming days giving our government the powers it needs to impose serious economic consequences on British Columbia if its government continues on its present course so it's been a week since she said that and what is her legislation what are those super tough consequences nothing I am quite confident that the nature of the conversation that we are having at this point will get the job done in terms of eliminating the uncertainty that's caused the May 31st deadline and I'm confident that it will be felt but I think at the end of the day one of the the messages that will be sent to investors is that when the government the federal government makes a decision that is in the national interest to approve a piece of infrastructure that is critical to an overall industry the size and depth and breadth of Canada's energy industry that investors can know that that decision will in fact be implemented and that's what that's what we're working on insuring happens so so nothing nothing's gonna happen she's she's quite confident though she says but obviously she's not confident if her only solution is that taxpayers will now have to buy this pipeline because Kinder Morgan is obviously getting out she has not convinced them to stay obviously but what about all that super tough legislation and all those super mean consequences that she had promised well nothing nothing so let's go to the third guy in this play fighting play-acting charade John Oregon the only guy who's actually saying what he means he's pretty much the long on the short of it here take a look however despite all of the commonality between the three of us we continue to disagree on the question of moving the bitch women from Alberta to the Port of Vancouver so no just plain old no that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
