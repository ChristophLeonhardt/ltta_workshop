1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,889
What do you see when you look at a pinball
machine?

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:06,050
I kind of see, like, a giant slot machine.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,340
There’s shiny things and bright lights.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,789
Letters that don’t mean anything that aren’t
linked up to anything.

5
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:13,030
It’s just designed for beeps and boops.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,700
But what happens if you do this?

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,240
And what if you do it again?

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,000
And again?

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,300
This is how you’re meant to play pinball.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,890
And while a casual player might see a bunch
of blinking lights, a skilled pinball player

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,620
sees a map.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,800
People tend to get overwhelmed by pinball
because they think the game is random.

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,970
I never know what to look at.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,600
Every time I play, I feel like the ball just
goes wherever the hell it wants to go.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,910
I’m just, like, hitting things aggressively
and hoping it works out.

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,720
But just like any arcade game, you can learn
how to get better.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,890
Don’t take it from me, though.

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,590
My name is Roger Sharpe, and I have been playing
pinball for far too long.

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,340
There’s so much luck here, not skill.

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,640
I’m breaking the bank and I don’t even
know what I’m doing!

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,850
Well, what you’re doing kinetically is manipulating
flippers to hit a ball, and you’re going

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,180
in a certain line of action when the ball’s
down on the flipper.

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,180
That is skill.

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,330
I think the biggest hurdle for most people
is that they think that the ball is not controllable.

25
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,250
And if the game is working against you, it
makes sense to just jump from game to game

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,250
and try your luck.

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:18,900
Right?

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,460
Well, no, each game was different.

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,290
Each game had different geometry; each game
had different rules.

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,000
Even though each game is unique, there are
common elements to look for on any pinball

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
machine.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,960
At the bottom, you’ve got a plunger to get
the ball going and flippers that keep it from

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,380
draining and hit it toward targets.

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,159
Knowing how to use these is the key to the
game.

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,330
But If you’re like me, you probably use
flippers like this:

36
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,409
When you’re supposed to play like this:

37
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,480
If you can slow things down, it’s to your
advantage.

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,340
Just above the flippers are slingshots.

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,689
They add a little chaos to the ball’s path.

40
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:56,110
The middle of the board is where you’ll
usually find target banks, like this one,

41
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,659
that spell out a word, and chutes, which will
take your ball and kick it out somewhere else

42
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,659
on the play field.

43
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,560
And there’s always these guys: jet bumpers.

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,419
And while it might seem like they’re meant
to derail your game, they’re actually pretty

45
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,259
harmless.

46
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,620
Most of those are done in clusters – done
in clusters for a reason.

47
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,610
It’ll bounce a little bit, maybe go back
up a lane. It’s not necessarily going

48
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,180
to come back in your face.

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,599
Up top, you’ve the source of a lot of big
points: ramps.

50
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,340
They’re usually designed to drop the ball
straight back onto the flipper, so you’re

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,650
incentivized to crack shots at them again
and again.

52
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,590
Those are your basic targets, and deciding
which one to go for is actually pretty simple.

53
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,860
At least initially, go for whatever targets
are lit – that means they’re activated

54
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,450
and worth points.

55
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,650
And when you hit them, the game will light
something else, telling you where to go next.

56
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,030
One way to get the high score is by completing
simple objectives called modes.

57
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,090
Modes feature specific targets on the play
field and usually increase their value temporarily

58
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,670
– you just need to figure out how to unlock
them.

59
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,730
So if it is completing a target bank to light
a particular mode, let me complete those targets,

60
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,080
and now suddenly, that center ramp is lit.

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,560
But if you want to get really good at pinball,
there’s one thing you’ll find in almost

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,440
every game: multiball.

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,120
Multiball is a hectic, beautiful, and terrifying
mode where you juggle multiple balls simultaneously

64
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,440
and try to hit specific shots called jackpots.

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,790
Jackpot!

66
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,040
Jackpots only light up during multiball, and
they’re worth a lot of points.

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,599
Here’s how you do it: Check the game’s
rule card and figure out what you need to

68
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,440
complete to light the locks.

69
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:37,440
Once lit, these will hold on to your ball
and give you a new one.

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,560
Lock three balls and the game spits them all
back out at once.

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,069
It sounds simple, but hitting all the right
targets is not an easy task.

72
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,780
I am building from ball to ball to get to
some objective.

73
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,390
And I have to build and go through cycles
of finishing target banks or whatever else

74
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,599
to get to multiball, in order to maybe get
a jackpot, where my higher scoring thresholds

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,100
are.

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,920
People tend to give up easily on pinball because
it sometimes seems like the game has a mind

77
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,620
of its own.

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,660
I mean, I give up because I literally end
the game in five seconds, so.

79
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,860
Sometimes I, like, will get the multiball
– I have no idea what makes multiball happen.

80
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,979
It all feels random.

81
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,749
The idea of it being totally random takes
away the fact that you can actually accomplish

82
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:29,830
something that you’ve never accomplished
before.

83
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,430
“I’ve never gotten multiball before – oh,
my god, I just got multiball.

84
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,389
I’m blinded by it; it happened so quickly.

85
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,500
But I got it.

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,680
Next time, I’ll be ready.

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe I’ll get a jackpot.”
