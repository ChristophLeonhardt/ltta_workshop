it's not just Anjem Choudary that's getting out of prison there's dozens of them Islamist hate preacher Anjem Choudary is being released from prison after serving only half of his prison sentence and despite the fact that this guy's been preaching hate and extremist Islam for 20 odd years he's connected to multiple terror attacks his own disciples have gone on to murder people and even behead people in our own streets but no the government doesn't seem to be willing to do anything the letting him walk free they're not accepting that the system's broken and doesn't work they're letting him out that's by the way that's why I started jail and Jim calm if you've not done it already please go to jail and Jim calm sign the petition and consider chipping in as well for our fund because I want to get if we can make enough money billboards in London telling the government that we want to jail Anjem and I'd love to Commission a professional opinion poll to show that the British people want Anjem Choudary in jail if we can raise enough money I'll do that but I need your help so do please go to jail and Jim calm and share it with everyone you know this is super important but the message today is I want people to realize that it's not just an tiem Chowdhury no no no there's way more to this story it's more than just Anjem Choudary in fact first of all let's talk about missing or raman probably pronouncing his name home he's a 35 year old disciple of Chowdhury who's potentially even more dangerous than he is amazingly he was jailed alongside an jim Chowdhury but his works quite different because he has experience operating secret websites and forums for Islamic radicals so he's way more tech savvy than our dear old Anjem in fact The Telegraph reports on this and they said Raman from North London was groomed at 17 by Chowdhury and the exiled hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed he studied under both men Raman became a web designer and created secret internet forums for Al Muhajiroun disciples why was also prolific on social media including Twitter under the name Abu baraa and yet somehow were meant to believe the authorities and the police when they say that him and his mate childr he are going to abide by a court or and definitely not reach out to the other extremist makes on the Internet right give me a break this man's dangerous he knows how to use the Internet he knows how to go undetected for long periods of time I don't believe that these people are going to be watched effectively enough to stop them from committing any atrocities or inspiring others to commit atrocities and it's more than just those - way more in fact I reported earlier this year that as many as 80 terrorists are being released from prison later this year yes I'm serious Ben Weiss the security minister admitted that dozens of terrorists will be released from prison but that we shouldn't worry by the way but we shouldn't worry he says because the Home Office will be monitoring convicted terrorists in an attempt to help disengage them from extremism I'm sure that's going to go well The Times reported that more than 40% of sentences for terrorism issued between the years 2007 and 2016 will have ended by the end of 2018 so that means 80 out of 193 convicted terrorists will be released this year does that make you feel safe does that make you and your family feel safe will you be comfortable with your kids going out by themselves knowing that these terrorists are on our streets and knowing that there's 20,000 potential terrorists on the streets as well this is insane just think about it shouldn't this be the evidence for the government the evidence that they need the evidence that slaps them in the face and says this system doesn't work terrorists convicted terrorists are going back onto our streets and over 20,000 potential terrorists are walking our streets right now and they tell us they're gonna they're going to watch these people and try and disengage them from terrorism meanwhile people they've been watching for years are going out committing terrorist atrocities this has to end this system doesn't work the government needs to realize something needs to change and that's where you come in I want you to help me as I say please go to jail and Jim calm we're taking donations because I want to get a big billboard in central London if we can raise enough money I'll do that I promise but we need to raise the money so if you Eve no matter what you can chip in or if you can't please share please share the link jail Jim calm sign the petition share with all your friends I will do my best to get a billboard out there will Commission a public opinion poll to prove to the government and prove to the mainstream media that the British people want an geum to go away for good regardless a political opinion people want this man off our streets I want to prove that I want to get billboards out on the streets I want to be a thorn in the side of the government reminding them we want this man locked up along with all his mates and I will take that petition to number 10 on behalf of you so please go to jail and Jim calm and let's lock up these monsters if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
