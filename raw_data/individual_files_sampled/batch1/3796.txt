and so what was that failure would you learn oh my god oh I mean where do I start you know management failure you know so so basically we eat Oh are two things one is how to be a boss how to lead the magazine second was what was our story if I was betting not that the internet you know was had failed but that it had succeeded if the Revolution was won the question is what revolutionaries do when the revolution is one do you come a counterrevolutionary do you become an establishment figure you know what is that story and we sort of assumed the story had meant about the subculture the rise the subculture we're going to say okay look right now everyone's something's fallen subculture but we're going to bet is the ability of the subculture that the Internet becomes from papers we'll just follow it into the mainstream and will declare victory and you know and now and then we're going to stop writing about tcp/ip and start writing about about how technologies changes people's lives what that means month in month out really I really messed up just time and time again could not find you know that the story that resonated for all people didn't believe the positive story in those days and second of all I wasn't you know I just wasn't able to articulate anything that was compelling and eventually was science that saved us the first issue that I did that it really felt distinct and fresh again was a science and religion just the sort of they the clash of cultures between those two and so science has become a core of what we what we do it wired and kind of taps into my background and plays really well of our readers and and is essentially you know some people say that the science is the only real news and it kind of speaks to kind of core truths about our world
