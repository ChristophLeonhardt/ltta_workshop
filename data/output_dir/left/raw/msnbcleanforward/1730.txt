COMPUTERS, SO THEREFORE THEY HAD TO BE SIMPLE TO EASE AND VERY

140
00:04:55,398 --> 00:05:01,828

164
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,980
SOMETHING THAT WE DON’T KNOW HOW TO DO YET, AND THAT IS WHAT I

165
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:55,448
TO DO YET, AND THAT IS WHAT I CALL SPEED TO SCALE.

166
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,417
CALL SPEED TO SCALE. THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT A

167
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,819
THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT A COMPANY LIKE OFO, A BIKE RENTAL

168
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,321
COMPANY LIKE OFO, A BIKE RENTAL COMPANY IN CHINA, STARTED JUST A

169
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:05,558
COMPANY IN CHINA, STARTED JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THEY NOW

170
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,960
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THEY NOW RENT 35 MILLION BICYCLES A DAY.

171
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,429
RENT 35 MILLION BICYCLES A DAY. AND THEY’RE PROJECTING NEXT YEAR

172
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,864
AND THEY’RE PROJECTING NEXT YEAR THEY’LL BE RENTING 300 MILLION

173
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:12,165
THEY’LL BE RENTING 300 MILLION BICYCLES A DAY.

174
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:13,166
BICYCLES A DAY. WE DON’T KNOW HOW TO BUILD A

175
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,267
WE DON’T KNOW HOW TO BUILD A COMPANY THAT FAST.

176
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:15,702
COMPANY THAT FAST. THERE ARE SKILLS THAT WE HAVE

177
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:18,271
THERE ARE SKILLS THAT WE HAVE WITH INNOVATION OF TECHNOLOGY,

178
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,440
WITH INNOVATION OF TECHNOLOGY, BUT TECHNOLOGY IS COMMODITIZING

179
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,375
BUT TECHNOLOGY IS COMMODITIZING SO RAPIDLY, THE CHINESE ARE

180
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:23,943
SO RAPIDLY, THE CHINESE ARE SAYING THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT WHO

181
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:24,878
SAYING THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT WHO OWNS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,

182
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:26,379
OWNS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THEY’LL JUST USE IT EVEN IF IT’S

183
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,946
THEY’LL JUST USE IT EVEN IF IT’S OURS.

184
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,982
OURS. BUT THEY UNDERSTAND SPEED OF

185
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:30,383
BUT THEY UNDERSTAND SPEED OF SCALE IN THEIR VERY LARGE

186
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:30,984
SCALE IN THEIR VERY LARGE DOMESTIC MARKET.

187
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:32,285
DOMESTIC MARKET. SO THE GROUND RULES OF

188
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,154
SO THE GROUND RULES OF COMPETITION, EVEN IN TECH, ARE

189
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:35,989
COMPETITION, EVEN IN TECH, ARE STARTING TO CHANGE ON A GLOBAL

190
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:36,289
STARTING TO CHANGE ON A GLOBAL SCALE.

191
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:38,525
SCALE. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF APPLE’S

192
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:41,361
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF APPLE’S ABILITY TO WIN OUR LOYALTY?

193
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,296
ABILITY TO WIN OUR LOYALTY? TODAY WE’RE NOT LOYAL TO MANY

194
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:43,663
TODAY WE’RE NOT LOYAL TO MANY COMPANIES.

195
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:46,599
COMPANIES. BUT ONCE YOU BECOME AN APPLE

196
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,602
BUT ONCE YOU BECOME AN APPLE USER, ONCE IT IS IN YOUR HOME,

197
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,204
USER, ONCE IT IS IN YOUR HOME, IT’S A HARD SYSTEM TO QUIT.

198
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:52,639
IT’S A HARD SYSTEM TO QUIT. >> WELL, IT HAS VERY LITTLE TO

199
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,408
>> WELL, IT HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY.

200
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:57,711
DO WITH TECHNOLOGY. IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH

201
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:58,679
IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH EXPERIENCED MARKETING.

202
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:01,315
EXPERIENCED MARKETING. AND WHEN STEVE JOBS RECRUITED ME

203
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,016
AND WHEN STEVE JOBS RECRUITED ME TO APPLE, I DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING

204
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:04,251
TO APPLE, I DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS.

205
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:06,219
ABOUT COMPUTERS. BUT HE WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE

206
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,789
BUT HE WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT DURING THE COLA WARS

207
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,226
FACT THAT DURING THE COLA WARS OF THE 1970s, THAT PEPSI HAD

208
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:16,897
OF THE 1970s, THAT PEPSI HAD BEEN OUTSOLD TEN TO 12 TO ONE BY

209
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:18,332
BEEN OUTSOLD TEN TO 12 TO ONE BY COCA-COLA IN 50% OF THE UNITED

210
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:19,733
COCA-COLA IN 50% OF THE UNITED STATES YET BY THE END OF THE

211
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:22,636
STATES YET BY THE END OF THE DECADE, PEPSI HAD BECOME THE

212
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:23,437
DECADE, PEPSI HAD BECOME THE LARGEST SELLING CONSUMER PRODUCT

213
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,573
LARGEST SELLING CONSUMER PRODUCT IN THE WORLD, OR IN THE UNITED

214
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:26,940
IN THE WORLD, OR IN THE UNITED STATES.

215
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:28,875
STATES. AND THE WAY WE DID THAT WAS, WE

216
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,046
AND THE WAY WE DID THAT WAS, WE SAID COCA-COLA OWNS REALITY.

217
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:32,947
SAID COCA-COLA OWNS REALITY. PERCEPTION LEADS REALITY.

218
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:34,782
PERCEPTION LEADS REALITY. WE’VE GOT TO OWN PERCEPTION.

219
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:36,450
WE’VE GOT TO OWN PERCEPTION. SO WE CREATED THE PEPSI

220
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,318
SO WE CREATED THE PEPSI CHALLENGE, WE DID OTHER THINGS

221
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:39,320
CHALLENGE, WE DID OTHER THINGS TO OWN THE EXPERIENCE.

222
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,855
TO OWN THE EXPERIENCE. AND STEVE SAID, YOU’VE GOT TO

223
00:07:40,898 --> 00:07:42,490
AND STEVE SAID, YOU’VE GOT TO TEACH ME HOW TO DO THAT BECAUSE
