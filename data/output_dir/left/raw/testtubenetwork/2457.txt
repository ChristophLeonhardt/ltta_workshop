00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:04,660
In 1942, after hundreds of years of persecution
and abuse, the US government

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,299
legally defined the “federal Indian trust
responsibility.”

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,679
It was a pivotal time in history

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,009
when the US Government, building upon previous
court rulings, officially took moral

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,289
responsibility for the plight of Native Americans.

6
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:18,820
Since then there have been many other

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,300
acts intended to improve conditions for indigenous
populations.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,960
The question is what

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,360
has the US done and is it working?

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,050
For the most part, Native Americans have access
to free medical care.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,049
There are

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,510
also scholarships and loans specifically for
them and unique financial opportunities.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,150
In the 1980’s, the Supreme Court ruled that
in states where some form of gambling

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,070
is legal, be it something minimal like Bingo
or horse racing, tribes in those states can

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,290
operate casino like halls and gaming activities
on their reservations.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,290
According to

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,980
the National Indian Gaming Commission, casinos
now gross about 28 billion dollars

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,570
annually and have stimulated job creation
and population growth.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,570
The US Justice

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,190
Department is also now allowing some tribes
to grow and sell marijuana.

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,970
These policies are intended to help combat
poverty and other socio-economic

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,970
problems.

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,850
But as of yet there is little proof that they’re
working.

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,510
In 2012, those who identified exclusively
as Native American or Alaska Native, had

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,320
a poverty rate of almost 30 percent.And Native
American and Alaska Natives are more

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,030
at risk for substance abuse, gang-involvement,
mental-health issues, child-victimization

27
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,030
and suicide.

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,790
Before Obamacare, many free clinics for Native
Americans did not provide a full

29
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,840
array of services, and 30 percent of Native
Americans remained uninsured.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,850
Casinos also have a spotty record.

31
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,890
According to the Native American Rights Fund,

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,270
“Gaming on Indian reservations has not appreciably
lowered the high levels of poverty

33
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,710
on Indian lands nationwide.”

34
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,030
Some even argue that casinos have created
a false

35
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,790
perception that Native American communities
are getting rich, which can be detrimental

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,060
to fundraising efforts for much needed relief
services and community development

37
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,630
projects.

38
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,930
Tribal leaders are also hesitant about the
new policies surrounding the growth and

39
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,480
sale of marijuana.

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,489
According to one representative, “Indian
tribes have been decimated

41
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:11,879
by drug use.

42
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,480
Tribal regulations of pot are going to have
to dovetail with tribal values,

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,379
making sure marijuana isn’t a scourge like
alcohol or tobacco.”

44
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,790
Native American communities are still among
the poorest in the United States.

45
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,790
This is

46
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:33,010
largely the residual effect of hundreds of
years of persecution at the hands of the Government,

47
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,129
including some mistreatment that is still
on-going.

48
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,390
And many see it as a problem that cannot be

49
00:02:39,390 --> 00:00:00,000
solved through more lenient gaming or narcotic
laws.
