in the Mueller investigation but very little of it has to do with Trump Russia collusion now we were promised that Trump Russia collusion was what this entire thing was about it appears more and more day by day now this investigation has nothing to do with Trump Russia collusion it has everything to do with obstruction of justice that's what it looks like it is moving toward so on Wednesday there a bevy of news stories about the Mueller investigation and apparently the Special Counsel is now trying to get Trump himself in for an interview Trump would be a fool to do the interview because the minute the Trump interviews with the guy it's a perjury trap right every time you talk with the federal government this is it first rule okay just as a lawyer and this is true right left center everybody if the police ever asks you talk to you the answer is wait let me call my lawyer okay that's always the answer if you want to be safe your answer is wait let me call my lawyer not because you just trust the police or you think they're gonna do something wrong but because you're gonna get caught in traps where you don't know exactly how to navigate these waters right the first word of any defense counsel when you walk into that room is don't talk here without a lawyer and that would certainly be true for Mike Flynn Mike Flynn talked to the FBI without a lawyer and now he finds himself i sat facing five years in federal prison I do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer this is certainly true of Trump who has a tendency to babble on at the mouth while this interview would presumably be focused on Trump's firing a former FBI director James Comey his alleged request to call me to let now indicted former national security adviser Flynn go and his pressure on various officials ranging from Attorney General Jeff Sessions to Deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe with regard to the Trump Russia collusion investigation so according to the Washington Post Robert Mueller wants to investigate Trump especially about the firings of Flynn and Comey sessions in Comey have both met with the special counsel investigators already Anna sources told the Post that Mueller quote has also expressed interest in Trump's efforts to remove sessions as Attorney General or pressure him into quitting the person said the special counsel was seeking to determine whether there was a pattern of behavior by the president so here's the pattern of behavior to go back in time according to Comey Trump asked him for a loyalty oath back in January then in February Trump fired Flynn because back in December Flynn had called up the Russian government and asked them to vote a certain way on a resolution at the UN and then he'd lie about the FBI to it so Trump fires Flynn immediately thereafter Comey says that Trump asked Co me to let Flynn go Trump didn't help his case when he tweeted out that he had to let Flynn go because Flynn lied to the FBI that makes it sound like Trump was trying to manipulate Comey into allowing Flynn to get off on federal charges which could be seen as him trying to move the investigation in one direction or another and then in May then then of course Trump fires call me and then says on national TV that he did it because of the Russian investigation and then in May Trump asked Andrew McCabe the deputy FBI director how he voted in the last election cycle when he was taking over his interim director throughout this period Trump was harassing Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Twitter presumably for accusing himself from the Russia investigation so what exactly is Mueller doing with all of this what here was illegal supposedly this is all about him obstructing justice Trump obstructing justice getting in the way of justice and Democrats been saying this for months that this is the direction they thought the investigation was moving now note this investigation began with the accusation that the Trump campaign works with the Russians in order to win the election and to stop Hillary Clinton from becoming president now what we're talking about has nothing to do with any of this so you talk about an investigation that is broadened out and moved sideways just like every Special Counsel investigation ever this is what has happened here and that is Robert Mueller's fault yeah when your job is to find crime you find crime even if that crime has to be manipulated on the back of other crimes meaning that Flynn probably didn't do anything wrong when he called up the Russian government but he lied to the FBI she's caught in sort of a perjury trap as I suggested before and then Trump is now gonna be caught in a an obstruction trap because he said something to call me about it at least that is what it looks like is happening here Dianne Feinstein the senator from California she's been suggesting this for months back in December she said quote I think what we're beginning to see is the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice I think we see this in the indictments the four indictments and the police that have just taken place in some of the comments that are being made I see it in the hyper frenetic attitude of the White House the comments every day the continual tweets and I see it most importantly in what happened with the firing of former FBI director Comey it is my belief that it is directly because he did not agree to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation that's obstruction of justice now is it really obstruction of justice as I've explained multiple times on the show the answer is no there are three separate federal laws that deal with obstruction of justice there's 18 US Code 1503 that is called the Omnibus clause of obstruction of justice it covers quote corruptly or by any threatening letter or communication influencing or impeding or endeavoring to influence obstruct or impede the due administration of justice but the clause requires a pending judicial proceeding that was supposedly obstructed there is no pending judicial proceeding that has been found here as of yet okay so that really does not apply also you'd have to prove that Trump materially impeded the investigation there's no real suggestion he's done that right the special counsel continues to investigate he hasn't fired Robert Mueller he fired James Comey but that didn't stop the investigation whatever he said to call me about investigating Flynn didn't stop Comey from investigating Flynn as Comey freely admitted in front of Congress okay second clause is 18 US Code 1512 C this provision of law covers anyone who quote obstructs influences or impedes an official proceeding or attempts to do so first of all it's not clear that an FBI investigation is actually an official proceeding but also you have to prove intent under this crime you have to prove that there was an intent to obstruct justice and a substantial step toward the accomplishment of that goal what was the substantial step now maybe make the case that the substantial step was him firing Comey but Trump can fire call me for any reason whatsoever that's not obstruction of justice unless he actually stops the investigation unless he stands in and stops the investigation cold and says you are no longer allowed to perform this investigation even that may not be able structure of justice by the way but he would actually have to come in and say I want you to find me innocent that be obstruction of justice he comes in he says I will fire you unless you find me innocent in this probe that's probably obstruction of justice but there is no there's no clear evidence that that was the case he wanted to call me to find him innocent but I didn't shut down the investigation after call me refused to do so and there's 18 US Code 15-19 this provision covers destroying evidence there's no evidence that Trump has destroyed evidence so what exactly is Robert Mueller doing at this point it looks like he's setting the groundwork for what would be an impeachment hunt by Democrats after the 2018 house elections if they went back a control of the house all over non illegal obstruction of an investigation that found no underlying crime other than lying to the FBI which is a crime but is not the crime that we were promised now Trump is gonna be tempted to pardon everybody who lied to the FBI Republicans will surely defend Trump Democrats will say this is all impeachable because people lied to the FBI and then Trump quote-unquote obstructed justice even if he didn't legally do so so he could get a nasty knock-down drag-out fight over an issue completely unrelated to Trump Russia collusion right that's the direction that investigation is moving and it's no wonder that people in Republican power Republican places of power are finding this difficult to deal with they're finding this discomforting because this is not what was suggested right this is not what the investigation was originally about Democrats said Hillary Clinton's election was stolen Donald Trump stole the election of Vladimir Putin's help that obviously is not what has happened here and no evidence has been provided that suggests that this is what has happened here now Democrats aren't letting the Russia stuff go obviously because they can they've told their base that Russia Russia Russia Russia is behind everything like just today Dianne Feinstein and Adam Schiff both Democrats from California pushed Facebook and Twitter to investigate the release the memo social media campaign like that campaign as you recall we've talked about it for the last week that is a campaign to release Devin nuñez's House Intelligence memo that apparently compiles a bunch of failures of FISA including presumably that FISA based its original investigation its original warrant on Carter page from foreign policy advisor on bad Intel right on bad Intel provided by a democratic capo firm so now Feinstein and Schiff are pushing Facebook and Twitter suggesting that perhaps Russian bots are manipulating the hashtag released the memo the whole goal here by the way is to push Facebook and Twitter so they shut down conservative news and information that's what the Democrats want to do here so they are corrupted they are pushing the rush of stuff in a way that is dishonest I think but you know I think that there's there's another side to this story too and in a second I'm gonna discuss the other sides of this story because the way that Republicans are responding to this investigation could be right and it could be very wrong now I'll explain what I mean by that in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over equip so you have a face on that face is a mouth in that mouth

with our advertisers so check that out as well okay so with all of this said about the Mueller investigation there is another controversy that has arisen and that of course is whether the Mueller investigation should be done away with completely now the Republican case that the Mueller investigation should be done away with completely is not the Mueller investigation has found nothing on Trump Russia so far because we don't know that right we don't know what Mueller has found he hasn't revealed that and it's a little bit of a jump from saying that the investigation was initially compromised to suggesting that the entire investigation will find nothing we just don't know right by all implication I would think that they really have nothing that's my opinion though I don't have the underlying facts and so I'm trying to separate my own opinion from the facts so we'll have to wait to find out whether the Mueller investigation actually finds something if all they find is Flynn and obstruction of justice I think everyone is going to be disappointed and should be at least in terms of what they were promised so meanwhile the Republicans are attacking the investigation itself by is hacking the FBI here is the problem either the FBI was corrupted by Democrats or it is not corrupt and Republicans are corrupting the FBI and and targeting the FBI to defend Trump neither of these answers is good neither of these is good for the country if it turns out the Democrats compromised the FBI an attempt to stop President Trump from becoming president and then continued to use the FBI in an attempt to curb Trump's presidency then that is corruption at the highest levels that is the destruction of one of the great American institutions destruction of a law-enforcement agency that requires the trust of the American people it's just along the lines of the Obama administration compromising the IRS and using it as a political baton so that's option number one Republicans are right and the FBI has been significantly compromised by Democrats and there is a quote-unquote deep state problem going on then there's Theory number two then there's Theory number two right theory number two is that the Democrats did not actually compromise the FBI the FBI may have some problematic figures like Peter struck and Lisa Paige in it but that does not mean the FBI's actually compromised the investigation is moving as most investigations do there's not serious democratic infiltration of the FBI it's just working as a law enforcement agency does in which case Republicans are targeting a law enforcement agency for Destruction in order to defend President Trump which is a really really bad look okay here's the basis for all of this so in the last few weeks heard the revelations regarding alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government and most of all regarding the FBI's investigation of it okay text messages between FBI agents Peter struck and his mistress Lisa Paige talked openly about a quarter unquote path you threw out for consideration in deputy director Andrew McCabe's office as a quote insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40 with reference to a trump election meaning we I mean here's how it reads anyway just to a layman what it reads like is we have an insurance policy against Trump being elected and that is this investigation into into Trump right struck worked heavily on the Hillary investigation he helped exonerate her he was also deeply involved in the Trump Russia collusion investigation hey that's breaking story number one breaking Story number two representatives trey Gowdy and John Ratcliffe they said that there are text messages between struck and and page that referenced a quote-unquote secret society working against Trump we haven't seen any of that so far and now Senator Ron Johnson who had echoed those comments he said that his secret society comments were based on an informant and the words used in the struck page text exchange he says he does not know exactly what they meant so everybody is taking that super seriously and suggesting that the secret society is some sort of you know Bilderberg conspiracy to take down Trump inside the FBI Ron Johnson is saying that he doesn't really know what that means so we got to take all that with a grain of salt Lorna theory is that the FBI somehow lost a batch of text messages between struck and page they turned over about 50,000 struck page text messages but the period in which they do not have messages from struck to page and vice versa is December 2016 to May 2017 which is during this entire compromising period writes during the bulk of the investigation into Flynn the firing of Comey the the supposed via quasi threats he Andrew McCabe okay and apparently the text messages stopped going missing conveniently enough the day that Robert Mueller took over the part of the probe which suggests that maybe they were texting about James Comey and then they got rid of all of those texts all those texts were deleted or the FBI got rid of all of them as soon as Mueller took over because it made the investigation look bad okay the FBI did change its language regarding Hillary Clinton before Hillary was even interviewed and of course the the news that the Democrats hate is this House Intelligence Committee chairman Nunez four-page memo that purportedly blew the lid off the FISA malfeasance in the Trump Russia collusion case presumably suggesting that the original FISA warrants against Carter page was garnered based on a bad dossier compiled by fusion GPS at the behalf of Democrats and in collusion with the Obama administration the DOJ and the FBI okay so that's all of the that's all of the information now here's the question is the FBI actually a corrupt deeply corrupt place so they're a bunch of Republicans who are suggesting that the answer is yes that there's a deeply corrupt thing going on here right President Trump is suggesting this himself president Trump tweeted this out yesterday he tweeted out well where are the fifty thousand important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Paige and Peter struck blaming Samsung right so that of course is a joke the Democrats in the media don't understand a joke so they thought that Trump was actually blaming Samsung which is idiotic he is joking that the FBI did away with these there were not by the way fifty thousand text messages that were lost between struck and page they're fifty thousand text messages total between struck and page and some of those were lost we don't know exactly how many now sarah huckabee sanders says that she that the Trump is deeply concerned that the FBI agents are biased against him and that the FBI has been deeply corrupted and compromised why does he think this is I think he thinks that there's a great cause for concern that five months worth of text messages have gone missing particularly given the individual that has part of that process has already been shown to be extremely biased against the president and was involved in what seems to be some very inappropriate behavior and that certainly is a great concern you guys are absolutely obsessed with everything to do with collusion if it has anything to do with the president we hope that you'll take some of that same obsession energy and fervor and direct it to some of the places where it looks like there could have been some really inappropriate and possibly illegal behavior okay so obviously the Trump administration thinks that the FBI is going after them Ron Johnson as I mentioned the senator from Wisconsin he is suggesting the same thing he says we see serious corruption inside the FBI so when the DOJ censured this letter saying that there was this glitch that prevented those five months of text from being released to you did you buy it or do you buy it well I'm suspicious I want to get to the bottom of it and there's so many experts in IT that say that those messages are somewhere and they need to be retrieved we need to see because the timing is very suspicious from mid December of 2016 after the election until the day that Robert Muller was actually appointed what this is all about is further evidence of corruption more than bias but corruption at the highest levels of the FBI and that secret society okay so this is the Republican theory right there the Republic the Republican theory is that is that the Trump administration is being targeted from inside the FBI by a secret society you know this all sounds conspiratorial maybe it is maybe it isn't but one of two things is true either the FBI is deeply corrupt or the Republicans are targeting the FBI in order to defend Trump which would be deeply corrupt in and of itself you know I was really disappointed yesterday Rush Limbaugh who of course I'm a big fan of he's the granddaddy of us all in in talk radio and in in sort of the conservative commentary at least those of us who speak for a living yesterday rush I thought went over the line when he was discussing the Intel community he suggested in almost true therus fashion that maybe the Iraq war Intel was compromised in order to get Bush maybe the Intel community has always been out to get Republican presidents here's what Rush had to say yesterday you remember what the agencies were telling this is the war in Iraq do you remember what they were telling us there was detail there were photos there was conclusive evidence Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and it wasn't just us until it was mi5 mi6 it was intelligence agencies all over the world what if just what if remember they all thought Gore had won that election until the Supreme Court came along and stole it for Bush this is what they thought the Democrat Party is the Washington establishment and the Washington establishment believes that Gore won the presidency in the Florida recount aftermath was bogus okay rush goes on here it says basically suggests then maybe the Iraq war Intel was compromised in order to get bush which doesn't make any sense along the time line the Iraq war wasn't launched until 2003 Bush was elected in 2000 beyond that the Iraq war never would've gone forward if it had not been for 9/11 Ann Coulter has been targeting the FBI as well suggesting the FBI was always corrupted what's weird is the chief she's conflating corrupt and incompetent the FBI has certainly made mistakes no question about it right she suggests that the FBI is responsible for for 9/11 to a certain extent which i think is dubious in the extreme but this is the danger that Republicans run into okay you can question corruption at the FBI without even questioning the corruption of the entire institution you can say there are bad apples at the FBI who corrupted this investigation fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine the entire investigations corrupt but instead Republicans are falling into this trap of now targeting the entire FBI which of course is not good for the country and it's especially not good for the country if the Republican Party is corruptly targeting the FBI because there is something there and they're just defending Trump no matter what I don't know enough to answer this question you don't know enough to answer this question the only way this question gets answered is once we know exactly what Mueller knows know what was in that file which by the way Trump can declassify at any time that FISA warrants on Carter page I want to know what's in that warrant don't you Trump can Declassified it any time I want more information whether before I decide that either the FBI is corrupt or that the Republicans are corrupt for calling the FBI corrupt right one of these two things is apparently true and there is no third answer right there really is no third answer maybe there's a third answer I think that answer actually would be that there are members of the FBI who are corrupt like Peter struck and Lisa Paige but not the entire FBI and that doesn't necessarily compromise the entire investigation or if it does compromise the entire investigation that's not an indictment of the entire FBI that would be I think the reasonable third position but those are not the positions people are taking Democrats are saying the FBI is spotless and therefore Trump was engaged in obstruction of justice in attempting to get the FBI Republicans are saying the FBI is deeply corrupt and was corrupted by the Obama administration and therefore ending the Mueller investigation is necessary I don't think actually either of those two positions are correct and I think both of them lack significant evidence well on just one second and move on to the B fallout from daca and and what's coming next on the DAC negotiations first I want to say thank you to our sponsor is over at Dollar Shave Club so you've heard me talk about the great razors you get from Dollar Shave Club especially when you use their dr.

temptation for Trump here is going to be fire Mueller pardon everyone and this thing as soon as it's I think that would be a big mistake at this point believe me if it turns out that there's nothing to the Mueller investigation if it turns out that this is really I think flimsy stuff then people will out there be out there on mass defending Trump right I'll be out there I'll be out there defending Trump I mean I've been trying to take as much as I can't a factually based look at what's happening here and try and base my opinion on those facts so I'm gonna wait for more facts to decide whether or not this investigation is just deeply corrupt I will say that it looks like there are problems inside the FBI I don't know those problems go to the entire FBI I don't know they discredit the entire investigation I'll also say that you know the pattern of obstruction that Muller is trying to find in Trump can be explained one of two ways either Trump is trying to obstruct justice in order to defend his friends and hide from something nefarious or Trump is dolt is a dolt and and he just says stuff because he feels it like I like Flynn they call me could you leave Milan or Flynn's or commis annoying me because he won't just say I'm innocent I know I'm innocent he's fired all right I think honestly what makes all of these scandals seem to seem to go away a little bit anyway is if you suggest that they are mostly based on stupidity rather than malice when it comes to government that is oh that's almost always a good bet it's not just for Trump it's true pretty much everyone's stupidity rather than malice usually rules the day when it is mouse it's pretty clear like Adam Schiff and Diane Feinstein suggesting the Russian bots are behind release the memo that's malice to me because Feinstein and Schiff are both smart people and they know better than this but this most all of this mostly looks like an insane amount of stupidity piled on top of stupidity rather than malice in a get Trump effort but my mind is willing to be persuaded on any of these scores I just need more evidence okay so meanwhile more fallout from daca so obviously the government shutdown ended earlier this week Democrats got nothing in return but they are receiving some protests which is which is quite entertaining apparently they're a bunch of daca recipients dreamers actually went outside Chuck Schumer's house and were protesting outside chuck schumer's house yesterday that wasn't the only place that they were protesting by the way they apparently blocked an entrance to Disneyland on Monday now we were at Disneyland on Sunday we had a great time met some fans which was always a party when it's kind of fun going to places like Disneyland you meet a lot of listeners and and hello to all of the people I met at Disneyland that was always party but according to the LA Times the next day monday daca recipients stood in a crosswalk at South Harbor around 10:00 a.m. and blocked buses from entering the Anaheim theme park 15 protesters were quickly removed by law enforcement officers and were relocated to a sidewalk where they held signs and chanted no dream no deal so it's about 20 people and Disneyland operated completely normally I do have a question as I say as a regular Disneyland patron and yes season ticket holder I have two young children this is insanely idiotic what in the hell does the happiest place on earth have to do with people illegally in the country retaining their ability to stay in the country it ought to be noted that Disneyland has a pretty strict immigration policy no ticket no entry and they have a wall a giant fence around the entire park and if you try to climb the wall they will call the police on you so Disneyland unless they are protesting for free entry to Disneyland which is something I might be able to get behind on occasion I don't know why they would do this but it just demonstrates the demonstrators themselves just do things without really any thought simply to get the press meanwhile Chuck Schumer is idiotic Lee trying to blackmail Republicans I don't think any of this is going anywhere as I suggested yesterday I don't think a daca deal was imminent I don't think that Mitch McConnell is going to push one I don't think Trump is going to sign one I think in all likelihood we hit the March 5th deadline for for reinstating for for reinstating deportations and Trump just says listen we're not gonna give you papers but we're also not going to deport most of the dreamers and they go back to sort of this in the shadows in between status I got some emails yesterday and they're quite correct suggesting this is bad for the dreamers because with their current sort of green card status they can get jobs Trump would prevent them from getting jobs the truth is that illegal immigrants in this country have been working for a very long time which is how they've been able to stay in the country and and yes it will revoke certain legal status in terms of work but it won't it won't actually deport them anyway Chuck Schumer is trying to blackmail McConnell saying you have 16 days or or or I'm gonna get really mad like he's saying that he's not gonna shut down the government again so I'm or at least he's implied that so I'm not sure what the other what the stick is I understand that the carrot is the dock ideology don't know what the stick is here's Chuck Schumer Center Minority Leader warning McConnell so the Republican majority now has 16 days to work with us to write a bill that can get 60 votes and prevent the dreamers from being deported the clock is ticking 16 days that's not much time gotta get moving okay so I don't know what what clock is ticking like on February 8th they gonna shut down the government again I mean Schumer just gave well as leverage he also said yesterday that he was pretty obvious the Democrats weren't gonna be willing to shut down the government for the dreamers I mean he said this literally yesterday now for two days the government was shut down but all of us in the Democratic caucus not just the moderates but the Liberals as well came to the view that if we carried it on much longer two things would happen a no one would budge the public would lose support of the shut down the public does not like shutdowns and we'd actually lose support for dreamers too because people love the dreamers but don't want the government shutdown for it so we cut the best deal that we could so I'm really confused as to what the threat is he's saying you know 16 days or I won't shut down the government again because our people don't want us to do this and good luck with that strategy yeah it's going nowhere the realities Schumer doesn't want to deal because he wants to be able to claim Republicans stopped the deal Republicans do want to deal but not on the terms Democrats are offering and the Democrats are basically offering nothing now I mean Schumer yesterday decided that he was gonna withdraw his pittance of an offer one point six billion dollars in border security in return for legal status for the dreamers and their parents and Trump said no and then Schumer withdrew the offer after Trump said no so this is going and this is going nowhere what is hilarious I mentioned is the dreamers showing up a truck shimmers house here here are some of the dreamers protesting outside Schumer's house okay he says if Chuck won't let us dream then we won't let him sleep the note to these people Chuck Schumer was not sleeping in his house last night he was in Washington DC so there are very bright stuff again the Democrats are offering nothing Blumenthal a senator senator Blumenthal from Connecticut he Richard Blumenthal he he said that Democrats would support increased border security but no wall so obviously this negotiation is going nowhere a border wall is a waste of money squandering billions of dollars on an ineffective solution of border security is really reprehensible so we are going to be supporting border security surveillance drones more training for the agents who are there and additional agents the guys nonsense they don't want more border security they don't want to deal right then they don't want to deal of any sort here okay so here's so here's the reality the Democrats are not interested in a deal because Democrats aren't in favor of illegal immigration okay they really are okay the reason that I say this is because the the state of California my home state one of the perhaps I don't think perhaps that is the dumbest state the dumbest state in the Union apparently there's a new California policy and it begins on April 2nd that automatically registers people who obtain or renew driver's licenses to vote okay this is this is the new policy the new the new state policy is that you are registered to vote automatically when you obtain or renew your driver's license well here's the problem in the state of California illegal immigrants have driver's licenses so you can renew you can actually register to vote in the state of California as an illegal immigrant right now so the the idea that they're trying to crack down on the dilemma grants is silly by the way there are certain principalities I believe in California where they're openly saying maybe we should allow illegal immigrants to vote we'll just give them to facto citizenship and allow them to vote so pretty amazing stuff but Democrats obviously have an interest in the continuation of illegal immigration that's why they are fighting so hard against a border security and that is constantly worth pointing out okay in just a second I'm gonna discuss with you the latest that's happening at Yukon I'm supposed to speak at University of Connecticut tonight Plus is it worthwhile to forgive President Trump for his sins for his trespasses because it seems like some evangelicals are willing to do just that and I'll discuss whether that's appropriate or not but first you're gonna have to go over and subscribe so first of all before we get to that I just want to say that on January 30th you need to be watching because our president is gonna be speaking to the nation in the first State of the Union address right it's gonna be a really exciting event and you should watch it with us here at the daily what we're doing a special broadcast can be awesome starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern 5:00 p.m. Pacific we're gonna be hanging out with you the entire time leading up to

political leaders it'll basically be like MS 3tk Mystery Science Theater it'll be like that except with politics so it should be a lot of fun if you watched our election night broadcast it was a lot

8 p.m. Eastern 5:00 p.m. Pacific follow us on Facebook and YouTube get notified when we go live so we can spend every single terrible moment of the state I hate the State of the Union I freaking hate it I think the state of unions garbage I'll talk about that more next week but I really really hate the State of the Union I think it's an imperial spectacle that is absolute nonsense and Horse and hogwash it is not mandated by the Constitution okay the Constitution suggests that the president can be requested to give an update to Congress from time to time he could send it in a letter that I think would be better but instead we're all gonna have to pretend to think there's a great American spectacle left anyway we're gonna be there and be negative and terrible about it or at least I will and then Michael Mills and Andrew Clavin will be all happy to happy do about it and then turn me boring will sit there and drinks that'll basically be how the evening goes and you can join us again

the guy hurriedly took his daily wire Facebook his daily wire tumblr off his desk and hid it in his drawer and so our stalwart friends then had a half hour meeting about how awesome we are you can be part of that secret society our own daily wire secret society by becoming an annual member and getting the leftist tears hot or cold tumblr which is your past passcode it is your ticket to the secret society also just wanna listen later iTunes SoundCloud stitcher Google Play all of these places have our podcast on audio you can subscribe at YouTube as well we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty so I want to give you the update from the University of Connecticut so I am supposed to speak at University of Connecticut tonight originally this event was open to the public as always as usual the left made enough trouble that now they're they're staffing up with police officers and they have barred the general public from attending the speech which is just in nain apparently we're only in a room that fits about 250 people there have been over 500 student reservations and a minimum if they'd open it up to the public that probably would've been another thousand but as it is it is restricted to students alone they say for security reasons oddly enough when Anita Hill spoke here just about a month and a half ago there was no security presence necessary essentially and everyone from the general public was allowed to attend this is the new way of preventing the message from getting out is by preventing the public from coming and listening now I'm not gonna put that all on UConn I don't think it's the administration that is that is making this making this issue happen except to the extent that they are allowing the HEC waters veto to prevent the public from hearing what we do so that is happening tonight at 7 p.m. at Yukons we'll be speaking there the aunt the anti-fog Rupe there is upset with me apparently they had encouraged people to show up and directly confront Lucia Nguyen French but instead of protesting me directly they say that they are going to set up a parallel event with some guy that I've really never heard of who's kind of an obscure gadfly who his only as far as I can tell his only prominence in life has come from writing a piece about me for an for a magazine that he self funds or funds on charitable contributions and that nobody has ever read except for this one article about me he's speaking at the same time so I will say I am very excited that I have generated an entire Bendis tree I'm very excited that I have generated an entire cottage industry of people who can just follow me around critiquing me so that's exciting but they're having a separate event because they're trying to draw people away from hearing my message because this is what the left does instead of holding their events at a different time or coming to the event and then asking questions instead they're going to hold a separate event where they have some guys who liberally misconstrue everything I've ever written and then talk about how I'm not as smart as I think I am that's actually the title of it that I'm not as insightful as I think I am which is weird so I actually don't think I'm that insightful I actually think that I say things that are pretty obvious most of the time in any case and Tifa says that I am an extreme conservative who thrives on media attention of the campus opposition so rather than getting people to fill out to fill the auditorium we decided our general meeting to support students pushing for alternative programming to counter his toxic and politics so no good yeah don't show up and we might ruin my event that's great I'd prefer I'd much prefer to to push instead for for civilized conversation my favorite part of their little letter to the editor is that my beliefs caused me to overlook the need for ethnic studies and diversity related education in the United States who know oh no I oppose ethnic studies ooh useless branches of study that provides zero jobs to anyone outside of the ethnic studies divisions at universities like you come on so they've decided that they're going to fight for Scioscia fight for social injustice that makes sense they're fighting for social injustice that's true in our own forums in which we frame the message they're not gonna come to my event tonight that's fine with me I don't need you in my event it turns out to get the crowd out turns out a lot of people want to hear what I have to say anyway so so that is so that works for me so we'll give you all of the updates tomorrow after this speech beyond that in other news there is a lot of hubbub and now over over comments from Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council so I know Tony Perkins I like Tony Perkins but he he made some comments that I thought were were sort of weird regarding bad behavior in public fora so here is what Tony Perkins had to say about president Trump and his bad behavior in 2016 he allegedly paid off a pornstar 130,000 dollars to avoid talking about an affair that they had while he was married Melania and shortly after she'd given birth to their son Barron I here's tony perkins defending trump let me try understand you used the exact word mulligan to talk about this and obviously the most recent allegations involve an affair with a porn star that began a few months after his wife gave birth the president's wife and they also involved the president's personal attorney reportedly paying off the porn star for her silence and you're saying you got a mulligan you get a do-over here I'm quoting you why well if this behavior were occurring today right now as he is president United States I can assure you that's my support and support of Evangelicals would be dissipating very rapidly but we're talking about something that occurred ten years ago among a number of things that occurred with this president prior to being president and myself along with a lot of Evangelicals were not supportive of him in the primary in fact I've campaigned hard for one of his competitors it was windows down to him and Hillary Clinton he wanted to have the support of evangelicals and he came to them saying I'm gonna pro pro pro life justices I'm picking a pro-life conservative running mate so here's my big problem with all of this okay so he's basically saying the Trump gets a mulligan because it happened ten years ago okay you don't get a mulligan what you do get is us saying you like your policies but please you having sex with porn stars and then paying them off allegedly is disgusting behavior and inexcusable and gross and I don't understand for the life of me why religious people Christians Jews anyone can't understand the simple distinction you don't have to defend every bad thing that Trump does or give him a mulligan on it just because he's doing a bunch of stuff that you like lots of people do stuff that I like Bill Clinton pursued policies that today I would like in terms of deficit reduction okay that doesn't mean that I gave him a pass on all of his evils and the idea by the way that evangelicals or religious people would would break with Trump on mass if it turned out he was having sex with a porn star right now in the White House is just not true it's just not true I don't see any basis for that in any of the polling data that I've seen so far and this is anti biblical okay I'm just gonna put it out there it is the anti-biblical to suggest that Trump gets a mulligan you got to do over for it for the evils that he has committed when he's never repented when he's never repented so normally we saved the Bible segment for the end of the show but let me talk a little bit about what the Bible has to say about repentance because President Trump is somebody who has said that he doesn't seek forgiveness right these back in 2015 Trump was asked about seeking forgiveness and here's what he had to say Donald Trump was having difficulty to even talking about his own relationship with God he was asked several times about that he wasn't even able to say so in an ask point-blank has he ever asked God for forgiveness Donald Trump said no okay so if you never were able to ask God for forgiveness let me just point this out okay the reason that he is not like David is because David did repent okay Psalm thirty two David famously repents right it says of David blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the one whose sin the lord does not count against them and who in whose spirit is no deceit when I kept silent my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long for day and night your hand was heavy on me my strength was sapped as in the heat of then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin right that's the point if you want to rejoice in the Lord you actually have to confess you actually have to repent this is something Trump has not done so does not tony Perkins his job or my job or your job right absolution to the president on these charges the president is gonna have to go to God for that absolution right we can say that we back all of his policy when it comes to abortion we back his policy when it comes to religious freedom we back a lot of his policies America when it comes to judges but it is not our job to give him Mulligan's on personal transgressions okay if you can't hold these two thoughts in your in your head at the same time I would suggest that you are doing something wrong I think part of the problem here is that there has been a widespread worship of government that is spread throughout the land there's a poll from yesterday from the Wall Street journal/nbc that suggests Americans when they were asked whether government should do more or whether government is already doing too much they split 58 38 right saying that that the government should do more 58% whether the government is already doing too much a 38 percent worth noting in 1995 after the after Congress took over after Republicans took over Congress and the Republican revolution of Gingrich the split was 32 percent said more government 62% said less government in October 27 2010 just before the GOP swamped Democrats and took back the house that divided was 54 45 to 50 so in other words more Americans thought we should do have a government that does less then have a government that does more but ever since we've thought that government ought to do more and that now includes a large number of Republicans right a huge number of Republicans now say that the government should do more right so if you look at January 2010 the role of government 17% of Republicans in 2010 said that the government should do more today that number has almost doubled 33 percent of Republicans say the government should do more if you think that the government is going to save you if you think the government's job is to is to help you and save you and enrich your life and it's not just there to protect you then you're more likely to give a lot of leeway to politicians you're gonna say I want the guy in charge who agrees with me because the government needs to save me the government needs to help me this is a mistake it's a big mistake hey you shouldn't be worshiping that ahead of the government just cuz he's the head of the government and you shouldn't be making excuses or giving him Mulligan's over behavior that he has not repented for I find this this whole thing rather distasteful now speaking of distasteful in John Kerry apparently John Kerry did something so insane yesterday or the day before that it's just it's it's ridiculous according to The Jerusalem Post the White House confirms that since the Jerusalem declaration there's been a complete disconnect between the Palestinian Authority and the Trump administration but it now turns out the previous administration maintains contact with PA officials Maariv reported that former unity Israeli newspaper reported that Secretary of State John Kerry met in London with a close associate of terrorists Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas terrorist is my word for a long an open conversation apparently the this this guy who's representing Abbas a guy named Hussein Agha reported details of the conversation to senior PA officials in Ramallah a senior pay official closer confirmed Temari of the meeting took place so what exactly did Kerry say listen to this this is insane during the conversation according to the report John Kerry asked akka to convey a message to Abbas and to ask him to hold on and be strong tell Abbas a terrorist leader who openly came out two weeks ago and said the trumps house she basically burned down and suggest that nikki hailey should feel the wrath of god and suggested that israel is not Jewish territory and suggested that terrorism ought to be pursued hold on and be strong this is the minute the former administration that goes around saying that Trump is danger to the Middle East in the world this administration the Obama administration I mean you wonder why evangelicals rally to trump they shouldn't rally do his sins but you want to ride a rally to trump it's because of garbage like this John Kerry apparently told a guy who was again the stand-in for Malcolm to boss who's now serving the 14th year of his four-year election term he's originally elected back in 2004 for a four-year term he's never given up power since he's the quasi dictator apparently Kerry said that that Abbas should quote stay strong in his spirit and play for time he will not break he will not yield to president Trump's to mounds so you have Kerry over there performing his own foreign policy hilarious that Mike Flynn is basically gonna go to jail because he lied to the FBI about a supposed violation of the Logan Act you got John Kerry going out openly saying two foreign terrorists by the way just hold on don't do anything we're coming and we're gonna help you funny how the media don't seem to care about this story very much funny how it's just the right-wing media picking up on this and the Jerusalem Post and when Mike Flynn was talking to the Russians during the transition this is a big story but John Kerry who's not in power and hasn't been in power for a year and a half John Kerry is is is sitting around talking with with with the Palestinian terrorists about why they should hold the hold up hope against Trump and then he said maybe it is time for the Palestinians to find their peace principles and present a positive plan and then he suggested that he was gonna run for president and he suggested that if he just waits till 2020 then Trump will be ousted and perhaps Kerry will run for president this is why Republicans do not trust Democrats it's why people don't trust the media if the media refused to cover stories like this but they are gonna go hog-wild over Trump Russia collusion no wonder the media has has lost the trust of the American people okay so now let's do some things I like and some things that I hate so a couple of one quick thing that I like today so we've been doing fantasy stories this of course is the classic fantasy story of all time it's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll it's just a delightful book you know forget about all of the allegations about Lewis Carroll for just a second because I don't think we need to get into you know whether he was into small children in order to judge the quality of his work this is actually an interesting issue there are a lot of people who think that if somebody's a really bad person that we can't enjoy their art I've always found this a bizarre stipulation if the art itself is replete with the disgustingness that's one thing but if you're just saying that a bad person can make a great painting I think that's idiotic this book is is really terrific Alice's Adventures in Wonderland I remember reading this when I was probably eight and the characters the the wordplay it's just it's a lot of fun children's books from that period are so clever you read Winnie the Pooh it's incredibly clever Alice's Adventures in Wonderland incredibly clever The Wizard of Oz incredibly clever children's literature now is I think not clever at all I know a lot of people love Harry Potter which is really children's literature Harry Potter can't hold a candle to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland it is it is I think dunderheaded and right on the nose I'm not a Harry Potter fan but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland I think is quite great and and utterly worth reading okay time for a couple of things that I hate okay so first thing that I hate the New York Times is Mike Rosenberg actually tweeted out that he was he's very upset because I guess he's a Seattle Times reporter actually so he was very upset because after the Amazon Gold launch Amazon go launched yesterday and Jeff Bezos stock gained about 2.8 billion dollars in value okay Amazon go or basically these convenience stores you walk in there's no attendant you grab your products off the shelf you walk out no problem it's charge carry Amazon accounts and and so Jeff Bezos had a stock game because this is a cool invention so here's what Mike Rosenberg tweeted Jeff Bezos made 2.8 billion dollars in one day after his company introduced technology that eliminates the need for cashiers all cashiers in America make an average of 210 million dollars a day combined so what I'm confused why is that why is that a thing like that that doesn't make like what here here's what that's a stupid point the reason that's a stupid point is even if you were to assume that Jeff Bezos is somehow taking money out of the pockets of a bunch of poor cashiers okay the reality is that it's not that he's making 2.8 billion dollars off cashiers losing money to the tune of 210 million dollars a day that means that if he saved if he saved the the entire industry the cost of cashiers for ten days they would pay for that 2.8 billion dollars right the point is that you are number one the statistic is severely flawed they're taking the stock price which is reflecting the power of a new technology that is going to affect the market over time and comparing that to a one-day take away for cashiers and the statistic just makes no sense but the suggestion of course by Mike Rosenberg is that something terrible has happened here that the evil Jeff Bezos has stolen the livelihoods of cashiers know evil Jeff Bezos just made technology better and lower your cost at the supermarket because guess who pays for those cashiers it's you right when you go to the supermarket and you pay for things you're paying the cashier is why do you think that all of these like Ralph's is put in these these self studies self use items right these self use kiosks where you can checkout yourself the whole point is to cut cost what what absolute silliness and lack of economic understanding okay other things that I hate too Lester Holt over at NBC he went to North Korea and then he proclaimed that he'd been treated with respect by the North Koreans we in North Korea on Saturday we flew the North Korean state airline it's about an hour-and-a-half flight from Beijing they even make an announcement in flight when you eventually cross the border into North Korea we quickly pass their immigrations went through a very lengthy and very detailed customs inspection of not only our equipment but our personal items down to the novels we were reading even in one case a toothbrush of our crew members but we had been treated with respect here we have been invited and our guests of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs we stayed in a guest house outside Pyongyang last night and then made our way to this ski resort to get a look at a part of North Korea that most Americans don't see yeah so what right so so was so as Walter Durant he treated by the Soviets there the idea that they were treated really well by an evil regime that means the regime is fine just stupidity he's raked over the coals as well he should be okay we'll be back here tomorrow we will be broadcasting I believe from Dallas remove around the country a lot we'll be broadcasting from Dallas but I will give you the update on how it went at UConn tonight you can also watch the UConn broadcast tonight at yah org I believe we'll also put it up on our Facebook page and Twitter and and all of the usual places so check it out I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis
