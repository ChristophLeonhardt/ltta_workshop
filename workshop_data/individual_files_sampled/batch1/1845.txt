it's still night in Mexico City but already the queue is forming at this house the headquarters of president-elect Andales Manuel Lopez Obrador the leftist populace doesn't take over until December but already people are hand delivering him petitions it's a pilgrimage of sorts to ask for small miracles 70 year-old Raphael and his companions won a place to put their market stalls after they were moved on by authorities 14 years ago for him it's simple we believe in him and we know that he'll come through for us there's huge faith here in the next president mixed with desperation after years of knocking on the doors of seemingly uncaring authorities else's roof fell in with last year's earthquake she just wants someone to take up her case they just lie to me the authorities say they're going to see me and then just send me from one office to another telling me to wait and that's just not fair there's around 200 people coming every day with a spectacular array of requests help to get a pension or medical treatment to find a missing relative or get someone out of jail many like Raul have travelled hundreds of kilometres those of any American we want him to give us a hand to get a dairy farm running and to get our local economy going again as the day goes on the crowd swells and the man himself makes a brief appearance by mid-morning there's quite a scene here with people presenting their complaints lots of cameras and still the long line of petitioners here waiting to be seen and this is something that's not usual in Mexico where the political class is often seen as aloof and out of touch it's happening now because president-elect Lopez Obrador has worked to try and establish a direct link between himself and the poor and vulnerable to critics that also presents dangers there are worries that he could become a strong man willing to circumvent Mexico's already fragile institutions those here are ready to take a chance there's no one else left to get us out of this hole not because he's a messiah but because he's in power now and he said he'll bring change folks for that change are very high in this small side street if it doesn't come the disappointment will also be immense John Holman al-jazeera Mexico City
