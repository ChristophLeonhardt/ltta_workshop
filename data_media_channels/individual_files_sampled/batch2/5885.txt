let's put the Sun back on the screen some of the subhead some of the sidebar stories we're not getting to down at the bottom Boris Johnson who just resigned from the may cabinet would make a great prime minister that would be like someone coming for a state dinner at the White House saying you know I've I've always liked that Jeb Bush fella the center story immigration is killing Europe and on the right the mayor of London is at fault for terrorism apparently always a good way to get in with your hosts so Michael let's back up to NATO and what is left of NATO and how existential a crisis have they been through this week well it's this is a tricky one to evaluate Brian because you know on paper NATO is doing fine and the spending is up on a trajectory that began before Trump's presidency despite his inaccurate claims that defense spending by NATO members has increased since his election they are spending more on defense their capabilities are improving there are a lot there there's good news coming out of NATO sort of on paper but there's a huge kind of political psychological dynamic here and Trump just swung a wrecking ball through the psyche of the NATO alliance and you know frankly according to reporting from Politico as reporters who were in Brussels we actually have a European branch of Politico that's based there so we have good sources there you know the the European leaders there were just completely even in the context of the Donald Trump they've experienced for 18 months were completely bewildered by this performance didn't know what to make of it Brian it made me think of the scene in Apocalypse Now when Colonel Kurtz says do you think my methods are unsound and Charlie Sheen responds to him I don't see any method at all that was the response of these European leaders they just feel like he is all over the map there's there's they don't many of them don't actually think there's some hidden strategy behind it they just see a very erratic man you know Trump today maybe jokingly referred to himself as a very stable genius I think a lot of the NATO officials in that room felt exactly the opposite and and you know just to conclude the point the sensitive implication of that is that they're not sure they can rely on the United States at least over the next two and a half years and are going to have to be looking for looking out for themselves more and possibly looking for other protectors if it's not going to be America so Catherine lunch with the prime minister tea with the Queen one is not supposed to raise politics when one is with the Queen but one Donald Trump just might how to avoid the discomfort we are all guessing will be in the air tomorrow you know I think that when it comes to tea with the Queen even president Trump is going to probably be on his good behavior and we know he's a lot of that we believe this is a meeting he has wanted he presumably has been coached on protocol and the queen is not someone who's going to be political and she of course has met any number of political leaders of all stripes over a very long time in her role so I went and the first lady I believe will be there as well if I'm correct so I think that probably will be a sort of a temperature lowering moment and the Prime Minister's meeting maybe something different it'll be interesting to get a readout of how they get along with that story splashed on the front page of the Sun hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
