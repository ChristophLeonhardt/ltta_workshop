you couldn't make that up you could if I said hey political opponent of mine you won't start to hate the country they say tell me I won't you know and then they start doing it that's the perfect opportunity for us they've embraced an ideology called intersectionality and this is all the all the rage on college campuses so I go to college campuses sometimes and so you hear this all the time intersectionality is basically the theory that everybody who isn't a straight white man is good and straight white men are really bad and and it basically tells you that the problems in your life are not your fault they're that guy's fault you didn't know you're you know you've had a tough life you haven't worked that hard or you haven't that's not your fault that isn't know that was that guy and actually they even leave an out for the the straight white men because if you're a straight white man who doesn't think he's a man but instead thinks he's a woman then you too can claim the coveted victim status offered by the intersectional left it is an ideology and a political agenda of division and destruction it's not one based on a love of country Donald Trump ran he said I love this country I love of my countrymen I want us all to loved one another and love each other in the bonds of patriotism Ronald Reagan said the same thing what is the left office today they say oh I hate that guy I hate him I hate this group I hate that group and we need to divide and divide and divide along ever-expanding demographic lines
