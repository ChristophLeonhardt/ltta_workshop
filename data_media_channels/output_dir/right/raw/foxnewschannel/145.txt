BRYAN?

00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:09,273
>> HI, DANA.

00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:15,045
JUSTIN TRUDEAU SAID THAT CAN HAS

00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:15,946
THE HIGHEST MARIJUANA USE IN THE

7
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:16,246
WORLD.

8
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:20,384
SO THEY WANT TO CONTROL IT, KEEP

9
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:24,154
IT OUT OF THE HANDS OF GANGS.

10
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:25,889
THAT'S ONE THOUGHT.

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,257
A LOT OF FOLKS TRYING MARIJUANA

OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, THIS IS

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,095
A GOVERNMENT-OPENED STORE.

14
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:32,596
SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LINED UP

15
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:34,531
SINCE 4:00 A.M.

16
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:36,000
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO

17
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,334
PURCHASE MARIJUANA FOR THE FIRST

18
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:38,736
TIME.

COMMUNITY DOWN THERE.

27
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,351
TO SEE THAT CANADA IS PULLING IT

28
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:56,220
OFF.

29
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:58,222
I THINK THAT SHOULD GIVE THEM A

30
00:00:58,223 --> 00:01:00,457
LITTLE MOOSE AND HOPE THAT IT'S

31
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:04,428
POSSIBLE AND IT SHOULD HAPPEN.

32
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,097

CANADA, IT WILL BE ORDER ONLINE.

38

39
00:01:20,912 --> 00:01:23,113
HOW THERE THIS AFFECT THE UNITED

40
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,014
STATES IF AT ALL?

41
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:26,617
>> WELL, THERE'S A COUPLE OF

42
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:27,084
THOUGHTS HERE.

43
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,419
PROBLEMS PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE

44
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,587
FEARING ABOUT THE BORDER.

45
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:31,655

SAYS THAT IT'S ILLEGAL TO CROSS

50
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:40,531
THE BORDER WITH MARIJUANA.

51
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:42,199
THEY ALSO ARE SAYING THAT THOSE

52
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,301

00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:45,536
MARIJUANA INDUSTRY NEED TO WATCH
