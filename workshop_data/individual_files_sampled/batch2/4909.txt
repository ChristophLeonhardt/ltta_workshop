joining us now former CIA director now senior national security and intelligence contributor for MSNBC and NBC News John Brennan what did you think seeing those three Americans there and and can you just explain for me and for our viewers why no previous American president ever got to this point does this get more difficult from this moment on well first of all it's great that three American citizens have returned home I mean we should not diminish at all the significance of that that is good but now we are on the eve of a summit meeting between the president the United States the most powerful person in the world and Kim jong-un the leader of North Korea who is a bloody and murderous despot who has wanted to have the world stage before with an American president and what has he actually given for that well over the last year and a half or so he accelerated the program he has now conducted six nuclear tests he says he's going to dismantle the nuclear test site well it has collapsed by reports so I think he is very smartly and very masterfully kim-jong escalated and saber rattled so that he could then switch and appear much more accommodating and present a more peaceful face and so now we've gone from mr. Trump calling him Rocket Man and sick puppy to honorable and nice an act fine and excellent and and so I do think that Kim jong-un who I despise because of the brutality that he has put upon the North Korean people but unfortunately I think he has been masterful and how he has manipulated perceptions and how he's manipulated and quite frankly duped mr. Trump I hope that a summit meeting is going to result in a democratization of the Korean Peninsula what are they I think they're probably you know less than 0.1% I don't think he's going to I think he is going to pause he has worked over the last you know six years and then his father work to have this nuclear capability as a way to deter foreign military aggression led by the United States in South Korea I don't see on any scenario that he is going to give that up quickly willingly and so I think what he's trying to do is to again present a an appearance of accommodation he is going to put on pause a program that already has developed a nuclear stockpile he has ballistic missile capability already and so if he says he's not going to do anything more I think it's gonna buy him time and what he's trying to do is to get sanctions relaxed so that he can help his economy while maintaining that nuclear capability and this is gonna drag gain leverage or lose leverage when that happens I think we we have lost some leverage because now Kim jong-un is looked upon worldwide as you know because of the way mr. Trump has presented him very honorable and as somebody who you know we can work with and negotiate with well I'm glad that they're negotiated they're talking you know between the United States North Korea and Mike Pompeo talking I think that's important I think it's very important that South Korea in North Korea also are bringing tensions out on the border but I think what Kim jong-un is counting on is having relaxed pressure on him from China from South Korea from the United States so that he can maintain that nuclear capability let's not forget he already has nuclear capability unlike Iran that was prevented from obtaining one so I think again I think he's been quite masterful I think it's very deliberate I think he's been very strategic I think he again he escalated in order to de-escalate and then to reach a plateau that allows him to retain that nuclear and ballistic missile capability draw out negotiations over time and in the meantime be able to get the economic benefits that he has been looking for I want to ask you I wanna switch topics to Russia and I want to ask you about my old boss John McCain's an excerpt that leaked today from his new book he writes that Putin's goal isn't to defeat a candidate or a party he means to defeat the West's President Trump seems to vary from refusing to believe what Putin is doing to just not caring about it we must fight Vladimir Putin as determinedly as he fights us we we will stop him when we stop letting our partisan and personal interest expose our national security interests even the integrity of our democracy in the rule of law to his predation you have testified to your dire concerns about Russia's role in 2016 and I think it's your view correct me if I'm wrong that we are still not doing enough it has certainly been the sworn testimony of Christopher Ray that he hasn't been directed by Donald Trump to do more about mo Rogers and he hasn't been he's in an exasperated manner acknowledged to democratic senators that they're not doing enough it has been the testimony of every national security official who's been pushed largely by Democrats that we are not doing enough to protect ourselves from what John McCain describes how worried are you about the role that Russia might play in 2018 I'm very worried I think in two dimensions one I don't think we're doing nearly enough nationally as far as cybersecurity is concerned I just heard that name John Bolton the White House is going to do away with the cybersecurity coordinator what Russia did in 2016 just demonstrates the vulnerability of this country in that digital domain where our adversaries and male actors whether it be nation-states and uh nation-states can manipulate exploit and destroy things that are in that domain that we depend on so heavily so we're not doing enough on cybersecurity but secondly on Russia I think mr. Trump's policies and statements and interactions with mr. Putin are really quite perplexing obvious are you are you perplexed well I'm still perplexed as to why he is not doing what he needs to do on behalf of this country well you know people have speculated and I was peculiar that maybe he has something to fear from mr. mr. Putin and from Russia mr. Putin I agree with John McCain in terms of Putin looks at the world in a through a prism of a zero-sum game especially when it comes to the United States he believes that then when the United States is hurt or has is you know pulling back from the areas or issues Russia gains by definition you mentioned that we talked in the day that the president was through from the Iran deal and that was your point that the the in the vacuum and John Kerry made a similar point that in a vacuum we strengthen our adversaries adversaries like Russia and Iran yeah and I think Putin and Xi Jinping are demonstrating to the world that they are going to work with other countries they were also going to engage in some multilateral initiatives while the United States continues just to look out for its own interests first you know America first America first that's interpreted by many people around the world as is coming at the expense of others so I do think that mr. Putin is is continuing to try to make gains across the board and he sees opportunities now under mister Trump that the United States is not going to be that leader of the Western world that in the liberal democratic order that we have been for many many years I know you spent your career trying to stay out of politics but it seems that this president is inserting foreign policy into politics fill Rutgers a great piece out and and I've heard some similar things that he plans to take and as yet unrealized achievement in North Korea to the country is the midterm message for voting in Republicans and keeping a Republican majority does that make you how does it make you feel is it make you feel squeamish to see the stakes become obviously the North Koreans have access to American media they know what what's been reported here the president hasn't denied this does that make you uncomfortable where do you think that takes us in our diplomacy a lot of things that mr. Trump does made me uncomfortable I think he is first and foremost a showman and obviously quite a successful showman and he is out there on the domestic stage and on the world stage and he is able to convince people by just repeated statements of his about what he how he views the world and how he views how he pursues the policies so I am concerned when there are issues such as the Iranian nuclear program that we had as a result of our very close work with our allies partners and even all the members of the UN Security Council had put that in a box basically and he was trashing it and discarding it simply because he promised her in the campaign he would do so and because it was his predecessor who did it and so everything that came before Trump in his view is wrong and and so that just by every president it just reflects his his arrogance his self-promotion and unfortunately his very he has a prism it looks the world through as well what how is he going to manipulate perceptions and issues to advance his own personal and political interests and whether it's North Korea Iran or whether its domestic issues and I think that's that's what drives him every day let me get you on the record on a rarer area of agreement with the Trump administration you support the appointment or the nomination of Gina hospital to head the CIA why she is a very experienced professional she is somebody who is well respected within the organization I worked with Gina for many years I think she is very much nonpartisan she's a political she will speak truth to power and I do believe that she's going to particular extinct she didn't do that around the questions of enhanced interrogation well yes and as she I think very articulate said yesterday it was a much different time I think many of us if we look back on that time we wish we would have done some things differently I wish I would have yelled a little bit more about it I think a lot of people were involved in that but it was at a time when the embers of the World Trade Center was still burning and so I think Gina's somebody is going to protect the institution from being exploited and used by Donald Trump and so you know and also Gina is the best hope to keep the CIA independent from what the White House is doing with so many other departments and agencies by putting people in there who are true loyal lists and so I am very glad I think Gina's gonna be a breath of fresh air quite frankly at the agency so that you're going to have somebody there who knows the intelligence business and will not try to just give Donald Trump and senior policymakers what they want in order to give them the basis to continue all along some of these paths I understand what you're saying better than you can imagine thank you so much for spending time with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
