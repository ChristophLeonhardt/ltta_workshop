IS THE LEADER HERE IN WEST

33
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:47,724
VIRGINIA.

41
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:56,033
WHY?

42
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,502
>> BECAUSE, I'M SO UNCERTAIN

43
00:00:58,502 --> 00:00:59,937
ABOUT THE THREE CANDIDATES

44
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:02,172
I'M NOT WILD ABOUT ANY OF

45
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:02,506
THEM.

46
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,541
I'M A REPUBLICAN BUT I

47
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:08,445
ACTUALLY DISAPPOINT

48
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:08,479

ACTUALLY LIKE JOE MANCHIN

54
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,952
BETTER THAN THE DEMOCRATS.

55
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:15,919
TODD: IF THERE WAS A

56
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:17,087
REPUBLICAN WHO WOULD YOU BE.

57
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,989
>> EVAN JENKINS.

58
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,224
I DON'T LIKE THE OTHER TWO.

59
00:01:20,224 --> 00:01:22,793
I DID CALL A FRIEND IN

60
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:23,527
SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA AND

61
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:25,028
DID HE HAVE SOME GOOD THINGS

62
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:27,764
TO SAY ABOUT JENKINS.

63
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:28,799
TODD: WADE, YOU ARE A SMALL

64
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,766
BUSINESS OWNER YOU SAID YOU

65
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:33,370
ARE VOTING FOR PATRICK

66
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:33,837
MORRISEY, WHY?

67
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:35,138
>> I LIKE THE WORK HE HAS

68
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:36,740
DONE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL.

69
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,609
HE HAS BEEN VERY

70
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,643
CONSERVATIVE ON E.P.A.

71
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:40,010
OVERREACH.

72
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,144
HE HAS BEEN GOOD ON THE

73
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:41,979
SECOND AMENDMENT AND HE HAS

74
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,348
BEEN GOOD AT FIGHTING ON THE

75
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:45,549
OPIOID CRISIS.

76
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:46,316
TODD: IN TERMS OF WEST

77
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,217
VIRGINIA, THE ISSUES THAT

78
00:01:47,217 --> 00:01:48,519
MATTER MOST HERE, YOU SAY

79
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,387
JOBS IS NUMBER ONE.

80
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:50,654
WHY?

81
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:52,222
>> WELL, IF YOU DON'T HAVE

82
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:54,024
JOBS, THEN PEOPLE AREN'T

83
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:56,627
WORKING, AND, YOU KNOW, JOBS

84
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:57,594
IS IMPORTANT EVERYWHERE.

85
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:58,896
BUT WE PARTICULARLY NEED

86
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:00,264
THEM IN WEST VIRGINIA.

87
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:01,231
TODD: WE WERE TALKING

88
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:03,367
EARLIER, YOU SAID GOVERNMENT

89
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:08,639
OVERREACH, REGULATIONS UNDER

90
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,239
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

91
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:09,773
REALLY DID HURT WEST

92
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:10,440
VIRGINIA AND YOU FEEL THAT

93
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,643
JENKINS, EXCUSE ME, MORRISEY

94
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:13,877
IS THE GUY GOING TO GET RID

95
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:14,711
OF REGULATIONS WHY DO YOU

96
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:15,112
THINK THAT?

97
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:16,213
>> AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE

98
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:17,514
FOUGHT AGAINST THOSE

99
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:18,448
REGULATIONS IN FEDERAL

100
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:20,717
COURT.

101
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:21,251
AGAINST THE OBAMA

102
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,686
ADMINISTRATION AND WAS

103
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:23,086
SUCCESSFUL.

104
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:24,454
AND SO I THINK HE WOULD BE A

105
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:26,323
GOOD CANDIDATE.

106
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:27,357
ALTHOUGH ULTIMATELY LIKE

107
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:29,226
KAREN, I THINK JOE MANCHIN

108
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:30,727
IS THE MAN THAT IS GOING TO

109
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,195
WIN THE ELECTION.

110
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:32,829
TODD: THAT'S INTERESTING.

111
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,331
I'M GOING TO GO TO GARY

112
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:34,798
QUICKLY.

113
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:35,933
GARY, YOU HAD A VERY

114
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:36,900
INTERESTING TAKE ON THIS

115
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,267
ELECTION.

116
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,368
YOU SAID YOU HAVE THE SAME

117
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,003
FEELING ABOUT JENKINS THAT

118
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:41,605
YOU DID ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

119
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:42,506
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

120
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:45,008
>> JUST A FEEL GOOD

121
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:45,976
COMFORTABLE FEELING.

122
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:52,783
AND FEEL LIKE THOUGHTS MIGHT

123
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:53,684
IMPROVE THE ECONOMY IN WEST

124
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:54,918
VIRGINIA AND BRING SOME

125
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:55,686
JOBS.

126
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:56,019
IN.

127
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:56,920
TODD: LIKE WADE YOU SAY JOBS

128
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,422
IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

129
00:02:58,422 --> 00:02:59,456
FACING WEST VIRGINIA, WHY DO

130
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,324
YOU SAY THAT?

131
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:01,625
>> I'M RETIRED.

132
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,260
I'M ON A FIXED INCOME, SO

133
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,194
I'M DOING OKAY.

134
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:05,329
BUT WHEN I DRIVE AROUND AND

135
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:08,465
SEE PEOPLE, I KNOW THEY ARE

136
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:10,767
HURTING AND NEED HELP AND

137
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,469
TRAINING IN SOMETHING NEW TO

138
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:13,904
DO MAYBE SOLAR OR SOMETHING

139
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:14,838
LIKE THAT.

140
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:15,672
TODD: HATS THIS PRESIDENT

141
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:16,206
HELPED CREATE JOBS.

142
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,741
>> I THINK HE HAS DONE

143
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,609
EVERYTHING RIGHT.

144
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:19,576
I VOTED FOR HIM.

145
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,978
I HAVE NO REGRETS ABOUT

146
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,746
VOTING FOR HIM.

147
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:27,284
I FEEL LIKE HE HAS STAND UP

148
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:28,552
AGAINST ANY WORLD POWER THAT

149
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:29,453
WOULD THREATEN US.

150
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:30,887
AND I FEEL LIKE THE STOCK

151
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:33,056
MARKET IS LIKE BOOMING OUT

152
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:34,324
OF CREATION AND I FEEL LIKE

153
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:35,559
IS HE DOING GOOD FOR THE

154
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,260
UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD.

155
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,562
TODD: WITH THAT IN MIND, DO

156
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:39,963
YOU THINK THE REPUBLICANS

157
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:42,099
WILL TAKE THE MID TERMS OR

158
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,800
DO YOU LISTEN TO WHAT THE

159
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:47,838
THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO

160
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:49,906
>> I CAN'T AGREE WITH THAT I

161
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,475
FEEL AS THOUGH REPUBLICANS

162
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:53,377
HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF

163
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,512
MAKING IT.

164
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:56,179
TODD: GARY, THANK YOU VERY

165
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:56,480

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,514
WE ARE ALSO GOING TO SETTLE

167
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,082
A DEBATE HERE LATER ON.

168
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:02,019
MOST PEOPLE HERE ARE FOR THE

169
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:02,552
MOUNTAINEERS OF WEST

170
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:02,919
VIRGINIA.

171
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,155
BUT WE HEAR ABOUT THE
