IMAGEY.

00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,507

00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:31,582

>> COLLEAGUES EVERYWHERE.

25
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,136
VETERANS IN THE AUDIENCE

26
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,204
SCREAM AT HER TO STAND UP

27
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:56,573

28
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:57,441
DOESN'T SEEM TO BOTHER HER.

29
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:58,976
SHE IS AGAINST THE FLAG AND

STEVE: IN PARTICULAR SHE IS

33
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,147

LET'S PLAY SOME OF THAT.

38
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,620
>> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING

39
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:12,222
WHEN YOU KNEELED DOWN FOR

40
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:12,790
THE SACRED PLEDGE OF

41
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,991
ALLEGIANCE WHAT THOSE PEOPLE

42
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:15,259
DIED FOR GIVES YOU THE RIGHT

43
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,796
TO DO THAT AND DISRESPECT.

44
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:20,664
I THINK IT'S --

45
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:23,867
>> I WHOLEHEARTEDLY RESPECT

46
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:24,935
YOUR RIGHT TO PROTEST IF

47
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,270
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE

48
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:32,142
[APPLAUSE]

49
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,411
>> KNEEL AND TURN YOUR BACK

50
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:35,145
ON THAT FLAG.

51
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,313
YOU TURNED IT ON HALF OF

52
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:38,549
THIS TOWN.

53
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,417
STEVE: A LOT OF FOLKS IN

54
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:41,952
HADDAM WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER

55
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:42,286
RESIGN.

56
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:43,720
SHE SAID SHE WOULD NOT.

57
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:44,555
AINSLEY: SHE HAS NO PLANS TO

58
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,258
SHE HAS RECEIVED HARASSMENT

59
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,126
AND THREATS OVER HER PROTEST

60
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:51,662
AND CALLS FOR HER

61
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:52,129
RESIGNATION.

62
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,230
BRIAN: IS THIS ABOUT FREEDOM

63
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:56,834
OR IS THIS ABOUT DISRESPECT?

64
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:57,901
TOMI SLARN CONTRIBUTOR UP

65
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,736
EARLY FOR US OR OUT LATE.

66
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:00,571
WE'RE NOT SURE.

67
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:04,374
THE REACTION I FIND

68
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,442
HEARTENING.

69
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:06,944
>> WELL, THE CITIZENS OF

70
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,748
YOU COULD SEE THEIR EMOTION

71
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:16,854
AND OPERATISM WHICH IS PATRIOTIS

72
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:21,291
RIGHT.

73
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:22,159
AND IT ALSO DOESN'T MEAN

74
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,460
THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE

75
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,194
SHIELDED FROM CRITICISM.

76
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:25,496
SHE IS CHOOSING TO DO THIS

77
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:26,663
AND CHOOSING TO DISRESPECT

78
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:27,664
THE FLAG, CLEARLY.

79
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:28,899
VETERANS IN THE CROWD FEEL

80
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,933
THAT SHE IS DISRESPECTING

81
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:34,505
AINSLEY: IT'S HARD REALLY TO

82
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:35,672
WATCH THIS IN MY PERSONAL

83
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,109
THE REMAINS THAT ARE IN

84
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,410
CASKETS COMING HOME TO

85
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:40,744
AMERICA.

86
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:41,945
FAMILIES WITHOUT THEIR LOVED

87
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,447
ONES, THEY MADE THE ULTIMATE

88
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:43,814
SACRIFICE.

89
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,816
WE HAD A GUY ON THE SHOW THE

90
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:49,853
BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING IN

91
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:50,220
ACTION.

92
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,655
DAD NEVER CAME HOME.

93
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:52,723
DOESN'T HAVE ANSWERS.

94
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:54,424
SO, I MEAN, WHEN YOU HEAR

95
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,293
THESE STORIES AND THEN YOU

96
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:57,461
SEE PEOPLE KNEELING FOR THE

97
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:58,595
FLAG, KNOWING WHAT OUR

98
00:02:58,596 --> 00:02:59,329
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN HAVE

99
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,797
DONE FOR THIS COUNTRY, I

100
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:02,165
MEAN, TO ME, IT'S JUST SO

101
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,268
SAD.

102
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:06,937
>> IT'S SAD AND IT'S

103
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:07,371
DISHEARTENING.

104
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:08,472
I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON

105
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:10,374
THE HEAD THERE BECAUSE WE

106
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,275
HAVE SOME AMERICANS FOUGHT

107
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,676
AND DIED FOR THIS COUNTRY.

108
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:13,844
IT JUST SHOWS THERE ARE

109
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,647
SOME, USUALLY ON THE

110
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:17,548
DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE AISLE

111
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:18,782
THIS DISDAIN FOR THIS

112
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:19,716
PRESIDENT IS GREATER THAN

113
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:21,218
THEIR LOVE FOR THIS COUNTRY.

114
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:22,819
WE NEED REMEMBER THAT

115
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,488
WHATEVER THEIR ISSUE IS WITH

116
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,156
THIS PRESIDENT AND WITH THIS

117
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:26,857
ADMINISTRATION OR

118
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,893
TRUMP, IF YOU WILL, THEIR

119
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,830
FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THIS

120
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:34,698
COUNTRY.

121
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:35,732
WHY THAT HAS BECOME

122
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,200
SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

123
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:37,834
EMBRACESIDE BEYOND ME.

124
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:40,604
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY IS

125
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:41,705
PATRIOTISM NOT SOMETHING

126
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:43,674
THAT ALL AMERICANS BELIEVE

127
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:43,941
IN.

128
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:44,708
YOU CAN DISLIKE THIS

129
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,609
PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION

130
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,244
CAN YOU USE THE OTHER 28

131
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:49,112
HOURS AND 58 MINUTES A DAY

132
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:50,614
TO SHOW THAT DISDAIN FOR

133
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:51,281
THIS PRESIDENT AND

134
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:51,748
ADMINISTRATION.

135
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,116
YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ANTHEM

136
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,352
AND PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.

137
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:56,286
STEVE: FELLOW RIGHT BEHIND

138
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,323

00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,692
WEEK AGO LARRY MAGI.

140
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,427
THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE IN

141
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:04,428
THE SOLID GREEN SHIRT WITH

142
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:05,329
THE HAND OVER THE HEART

143
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,897
RIGHT THERE, HE SAID HE WAS

144
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,198
SO SHOCKED THAT SHE HAD DONE

145
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,100
IT, HE KIND OF LOST HIS

146
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,935
PLACE IN THE PLEDGE OF

147
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:12,336
ALLEGIANCE.

148
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,937
FAST FORWARD, HE TOLD US ON

149
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:15,305
OUR AIR THAT APPARENTLY SHE

150
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:19,977
HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR A

151
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:20,277
WHILE.

152
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:21,612
AND IN FACT THIS IS THE

153
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:22,980
FIRST MONTH OR SO SHE HAS

154
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:23,547
TAKEN A KNEE.

155
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:25,983
SHE HAS REMOVED FLAGS FROM

156
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:27,217
DIFFERENT EVENTS, THE

157
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:28,518
AMERICAN FLAG AND I BELIEVE

158
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:30,921
MEANWHILE HERE IS HER

159
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,289
REACTION TO THE FOLKS IN THE

160
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,156
AUDIENCE CALLING HER OUT.

161
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:39,997
LISTEN TO THIS.

162
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:40,464
[INAUDIBLE]

163
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:41,198
STEVE: THE TOWN DOESN'T LIKE

00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:53,744
COUNTRY.

168
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:54,378
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF

169
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,912
SHE IS REMOVING AMERICAN

170
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:57,381
FLAGS AND KNEELING FOR THE

00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,515
PLEEDGES, HAS DISRESPECT FOR

172
00:04:58,516 --> 00:04:59,816
THE STARS AND STRIPES.

173
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:00,951
WHY IS SHE CHOOSING TO

174
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,586
REPRESENT HER CITY, HER

175
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:04,554
TOWN, HER COUNTRY AS AN

00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,824
IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT SO

00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,693
MUCH AND HAS SO MUCH DISDAIN

178
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:10,961
FOR THE COUNTRY IN WHICH SHE

00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:12,663
LIVES, WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST

180
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,331
LEAVE LIKE THE REST OF THE

181
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:15,532
ANTI-TRUMP CROWD WHO

182
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,367
PROMISED TO MOVE.

183
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:18,301
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING WHEN

184
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:19,970
YOU LOOK AT THIS DEBATE AND

185
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,837
ONGOING PROTESTING IT, JUST

186
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,205
GOES TO SHOW THAT EVEN THE

187
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:23,507
PEOPLE THAT CLAIM TO HATE

188
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:24,808
THIS COUNTRY REFUSE TO LEAVE

189
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:27,678
ONE, RIGHT?

190
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,412
BRIAN: OR DO WHAT CALIFORNIA

191
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:32,382
HALF THE STATE THEY ARE

192
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:34,651
