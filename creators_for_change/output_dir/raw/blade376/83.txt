318
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,220
be nice I've learned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hostility</font>

319
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,439
that comes with debating politics<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

320
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,239
with those that are closest to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

321
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,730
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason alone I've concluded</font>

322
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,889
that politics is never going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

323
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,600
solution for most of the world's

324
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems I work with some very talented</font>

325
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:40,649
musicians in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> bands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just know</font>

326
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,209
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go really really far and</font>

327
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,269
to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform to put my thoughts</font>

328
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:48,569
and words to music is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dream</font>

329
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,759
country I've really thrived on knowledge

330
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,439
this year I've done whatever I can to

331
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:53,939
educate myself I've been reading

332
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:55,859
articles making notes while watching

333
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:59,939
documentaries doing online courses but I

334
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:01,619
do really want to become a much better

335
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,600
critical thinker although I'll never get

336
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how the story ends with humanity</font>

337
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:07,619
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live as much of it as possible</font>

338
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:10,639
it's also become clear to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that you</font>

339
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">know people come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and go in life</font>

340
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:15,839
sometimes friends disappear sometimes

341
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,079
you meet up again sometimes you

342
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,389
experience death and therefore the only

343
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,399
thing you can really be certain of is

344
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,649
yourself the control you have on your

345
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,239
life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why you should just live</font>

346
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,160
life to the full every second<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

347
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,959
which is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and do</font>

348
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,489
so let me leave you with three things

349
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:34,139
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been quoted on saying this year</font>

350
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,689
when you encounter ignorant views don't

351
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,209
hate educate no matter how painful

352
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,850
things maybe today don't let politicians

353
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,910
hijack your feelings and finally the

354
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,309
truth sometimes hurts but I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

355
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,269
regard that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing pains at Easter</font>

356
00:12:51,269 --> 00:00:00,000
next time
