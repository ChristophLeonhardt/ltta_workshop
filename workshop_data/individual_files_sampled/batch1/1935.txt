a frantic charge towards a rescue ship and a desperate plea not to be sent back to Libya all 87 people stranded off the Libyan coast saved by a Spanish charity vessel a week ago after a brutal journey they are among the tens of thousands of people who have crossed from Africa to Europe this year the ones that make it are the lucky ones many do not survive Amnesty International says that in June and July of this year more than 700 people drowned in the Mediterranean an increase in deaths from the same time last year and that's despite a drop in the numbers of people making that same journey alongside this there has also been a dramatic rise in the number of people being held in overcrowded detention centers in Libya in recent months the number of detainees has shot up from four thousand four hundred and March to more than ten thousand by the end of July nearly all were taken to centers such as this after being intercepted at sea and returned to Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard the surge comes after a backdrop of intensifying anti-migrant politics in Europe Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel faced a fierce backlash for allowing more than a million refugees mainly from Syria and Afghanistan into the country now the government is seeking agreements with fellow members of the European Union to send migrants back to the countries where they initially registered but this has done little to calm populist figures all over the continent who are keen to be seen as cracking down on asylum seekers amongst them Italian far-right interior minister Matteo salvini speaking to Al Jazeera more than 700 thousand people have arrived in Italy across the Mediterranean Sea alone we cannot continue this way this helps neither Italy nor Africa therefore I wanted to stop such action such human trafficking which could be tied to terrorism or to drug or arms trade whilst the European Union has provided financial incentives for member countries to take in asylum seekers it has been criticized for failing to act but until there is a coordinated effort by the EU as a whole this may simply be seen as a delaying tactic for a crisis that is not going away anytime soon Sonia go al-jazeera
