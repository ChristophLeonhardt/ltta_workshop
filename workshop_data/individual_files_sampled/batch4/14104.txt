dear parents outraged over Peter Rabbit any chance you could just lighten up of it you know see the funny side of life yes I know little Theobald is allergic to 28 kinds of foodstuffs including nuts chai latte and digestive biscuits I even get that one sniff of a peanut butter sandwich Worrell and little arabella in A&E gasping for air and I do accept that last year there was an awful story of a child who died at school after he was exposed to cheese I repeat cheese but please can you all just get your chubby little fingers off of social media encouraging each other to boycott Peter Rabbit in a game of competitive neurosis and calm the hell down it's a bloody rabbit a computer generated digitally manipulated thing of nothingness even its fur is fake which I would have thought would have pleased the militant vegans like yourself your ability to lend an imaginary rabbit sufficient credence that actually offend you says when more about you than it does about Sony Pictures or whomever else you want to blame for your issues this week how the hell did you survive Tom and Jerry isn't wondering what all the outrage is about in Peter Rabbit the movie Peter Rabbit and his mates attack Tom MacGregor with blackberries knowing he's allergic to them and he quickly goes into anaphylactic shock and has to stab himself in the leg with an EpiPen imagine my shook excuse my cynicism but food allergies are very much in vogue allergic reactions to food have increased over five times in the last decade if you aren't gluten-free you're virtually prehistoric cheddar man and remember kids cheese can kill it's strange we don't meet many gluten free kids in Syrian refugee camps or kids with nut allergies displaced from the Yemen funny that as a full-blown drop-down fit in the street and dislocate both arms in the process epileptic I can honestly say that even if Peter Rabbit had a grand mal seizure and wet himself in the process I'd still be able to understand this was not a direct dig at me all my kids the American group kids with food allergies Foundation issued parents with a Facebook warning about the film saying that food allergy jokes are harmful to our community aha there it is the badge of the eternally afflicted community making light of this condition hurts our members because it encourages the public not to take the risk of allergic reactions seriously and this cavalier attitude may make them act in ways that will put an allergic person in danger they say did you hear that children never be Cavalier unless you're a spaniel especially not about nuts or gluten or cheese all too predictably an apology was forthcoming from Sony Pictures who grovelled that the film should not have made light of a character being allergic to blackberries even in a cartoonish way and that they regretted not being more aware and sensitive to the issue but that wasn't enough take it from me never apologize it will either be too little too late or too disingenuous once the offender Tron's get a hashtag in a hard-on only blood will do boycott Peter Rabbit is the most tragic case of its kind what next boycott butterflies and wonder what Beatrix Potter would make of these pathetic parents the real danger to our kids is not Knut's or even cheese it's obsessive parents like these with a hashtag and a hard-on you
