00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,737
COUNCIL ARE UNITED ON THE FINAL 

2
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:08,641
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA 

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:13,113
AS AGREED TO BY KIM JONG-UN. 

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:13,813
NEGOTIATIONS ARE CRITICAL TO 

5
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,147
ACHIEVING THIS GOAL, MEMBERS OF 

6
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:18,284
THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, AND 

7
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,687
MEMBER STATES, HAVE UNANIMOUSLY 

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,353
AGREED TO FULLY ENFORCE 

9
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:23,923
SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA, WE 

10
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:24,791
EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO 

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,228
HONOR THOSE COMMITMENTS. 

12
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,095
WHEN SANCTIONS ARE NOT IN 

13
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,429
FORCE, THE PROSPECTS FOR THE 

14
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:31,164
SUCCESSFUL DENUCLEARIZATION OF 

15
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,866
NORTH KOREA ARE DIMINISHED. 

16
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,200
RIGHT NOW, NORTH KOREA IS 

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,571
ILLEGALLY SMUGGLING PETROLEUM 

18
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,606
PRODUCTS AT A LEVEL THAT FAR 

19
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,506
EXCEEDS THE QUOTA ESTABLISHD 

20
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:42,075
BY THE UNITED NATIONS. 

21
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:46,312
THESE ILLEGAL SHIP TO SHIP 

22
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,013
TRANSFERS ARE THE MOST 

23
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,047
ROMINENT MEANS BY WHICH THIS 

24
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:48,380
IS HAPPENING 

25
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,783
THEY HAPPENED AT LEAST 89 TIMES 

26
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,385
IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF 

27
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,019
THIS YEAR, AND THEY CONTINUE TO 

28
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:57,323
OCCUR. 

29
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,158
THE UNITED STATES REMINDS EVERY 

30
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,692
UN MEMBER STATE OF ITS 

31
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:03,829
RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP ILLEGAL

SHIP TO SHIP TRANSFERS, AND WE 

33
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,899
URGE THEM TO STEP UP THEIR 

34
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,800
ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AS WELL. 

35
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,937
WE MUST ALSO CRACKDOWN ANOTHER 

36
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,105
SANCTIONS, SMUGGLING OF COAL BY 

37
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:16,376
SEA, OVER LAND BORDERS, AND THE 

38
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,076
PRESENCE OF NORTH KOREAN 

39
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,278
GUESTWORKERS IN CERTAIN 

40
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:18,611
COUNTRIES. 

41
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,012
NORTH KOREAN CYBER THEFTS, 

42
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:23,116
GENERATING SIGNIFICANT REVENUES 

43
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,484
FOR THE REGIME, THEY MUST BE 

44
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,218
STOPPED. 

45
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,720
PRESIDENT TRUMP REMAINS UPBEAT 

46
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,289
ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF 

47
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,723
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA.

48
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,726
SO DO I. AS PROGRESS IS 

49
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,162
HAPPENING. 

50
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:36,863
IT IS THE TRUMP 

51
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:37,730
ADMINISTRATION'S HOPE THAT ONE 

52
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,668
DAY, THE D PRK COULD BE IN OUR 

53
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,534
MIDST HERE IN THE UNITED 

54
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:45,071

55
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,540
A FRIEND, IMAGINE UN SECURITY 

56
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,877
COUNCIL MEETINGS WHERE DPRK  

57
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,513
NUCLEAR PROGRAMS WERE NOT THE 

58
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,915
AGENDA TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 

59
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,150
WE WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS OUR 

60
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,184
ENERGY ON SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT 

61
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:04,724
FACE OUR WORLD, I BELIEVE THAT 

62
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,558
REALITY IS POSSIBLE, AND SO 

63
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,426
DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT IT 

64
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,259
WILL TAKE FULL ENFORCEMENT OF 

65
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,294
SANCTIONS TO GET THERE, IT WILL 

66
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,764
ALSO TAKE KIM JONG-UN FOLLOWING 

67
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,465
THROUGH ON HIS PERSONAL 

68
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,299
COMMITMENTS THAT HE MADE TO 

69
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN SINGAPORE. 

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,702
THE PATH AHEAD IS NOT EASY, IT 

71
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:20,173
WILL TAKE TIME, BUT OUR HOPE IS 

72
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,540
FOR A SAFER WORLD FOR ARLISS, 

73
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,276
AND A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR NORTH 

74
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,613
KOREA, IS OUR OBJECTIVE, AND 

75
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,981
HOPE ENDURES.

76
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:35,989
>>> I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO 

77
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,689

COMING OUT AND MEETING WITH THE 

79
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,558
SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY, THIS IS 

80
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,091
WHAT WE KNOW. 

81
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,793
18 MONTHS AGO WHEN I CAME IN, 

82
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,195
OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WAS NORTH 

83
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,896
KOREA. 

84
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:44,764
EVERYONE WAS WONDERING WHEN THE 

85
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:45,964
NEW TEST WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, 

86
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:48,601
WHEN THE NEW THREAT WOULD OCCUR,

87
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,969
AND THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL 

88
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,203
COMMUNITY KNEW SOMETHING HAD TO 

89
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:52,505
HAPPEN. 

90
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,308
IT WAS A HERCULEAN TASK BY THE 

91
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,977
SECURITY COUNCIL TO PASS THREE 

92
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,046
MASSIVE SANCTIONS PACKAGES. 

93
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,982

94
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,085
OF THEIR TRADE, 30% OF THEIR 

95
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,355

96
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,556

DOWN, MAKING SURE ALL JOINT 

98
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:18,097
VENTURES STOPPED. ALL OF THAT, 

99
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:18,864
COMBINED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 

100
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,166
COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER AND 

101
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,902

WITH THE PRESIDENTS TOUGH 

104
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,508
STANCE, ALL OF THAT WAS REALLY 

105
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,177
THE COMBINATION THAT BROUGHT 

106
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,447
NORTH KOREA TO THE TABLE. 

107
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,481
NOW, NORTH KOREA AND THE U.S. 

108
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,217

AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND 

111

THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 

112

HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE TALKS, 

113
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,726
THE BEST WAY WE CAN SUPPORT 

114
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,761
THOSE TALKS IS TO NOT LOOSEN 

115
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,929
THE SANCTIONS. 

116
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,700
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS, 

117
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,567

CERTAIN COUNTRIES WANTING TO DO 

121
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,774
MORE.

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,055
DENUCLEARIZE, WE HAVE TO SEE 

128
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,589

129
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,624
HAPPENS, THE SECURITY COUNCIL

FORWARD. 

134
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,131
THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE 

135
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:28,935
ENCOUNTERING IS THAT SOME OF 

136
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,802
OUR FRIENDS HAVE DECIDED THAT 

137
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,270
THEY WANT TO GO AROUND THE 

138
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,372
RULES. 

139
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,239

THAT THIS STOPS. 

148
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,992
SO THE U.S. PUT A HALT TO ALL

WANT TO CONTINUE SUPPLYING THE 

156
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:16,015
SOIL? 

157
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,083

00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,805
ENFORCEMENT. 

187
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,675
DID THE PRESIDENT MENTION THAT 

188
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,043
IN HIS MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA 

189
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,979
-- WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN? 

190
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,049
IS RUSSIA RENEGING ON AN 

191
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,250
AGREEMENT THAT IT MADE WITH THE 

192
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,550
PRESIDENT? 

193
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,053
WHAT ELSE TO THE TWO PRESIDENTS 

194
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:32,692
AGREE TO -- WHAT ELSE DID THE 2 

195
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,026
PRESIDENTS AGREE TO WHEN THEY 

196
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,928
MET? 

197
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,064
>> THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PLACES 

198
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,433
WHERE THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN 

199
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,634
HELPFUL, THEY HAVE DONE MANY 

200
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,369
THINGS TO ENFORCE SANCTIONS, 

201
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,770
AND WE ARE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE 

202
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,938
OF THAT. 

203
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,139
WHAT WE NEED NOW THOUGH, IS WE 

204
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,743
NEED TO CONTINUE THAT. 

205
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,378
THIS IS NOT AN AMERICAN DEMAND 

206
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,582
FOR THE NORTH KOREANS TO 

207
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,449
DENUCLEARIZE, IT IS THE WORLD'S 

208
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,019
DEMAND, SO WHERE WE FIND ISSUES 

209
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:00,887
WHERE ANY COUNTRY, WHETHER IT 

210
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,955
IS RUSSIA, OR SOMEONE ELSE NOT 

211
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,691
DOING THEIR PART TO ENFORCE IT, 

212
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,559
WE PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THEM, 

213
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:11,364
THE WORLD CAN SEE IT, WE WILL 

214
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,231
REQUEST THAT EVERY COUNTRY IN 

215
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:16,269
THE WORLD DO THEIR PART.

216
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,907
>> THERE WAS THIS QUESTION 

217
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,075
ABOUT RUSSIA, WHY IS IT A GOOD 

218
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,078
IDEA FOR THE PRESIDENT TO INVITE

219
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,081
VLADIMIR PUTIN TO THE WHITE 

220
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,982
HOUSE? 

221
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,183
WHAT DOES THE U.S. HAVE TO GAIN 

222
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,952
FROM THAT VISIT? 

223
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,787
>> I AM HAPPY THAT THE TWO 

224
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,454
LEADERS OF IMPORTANT COUNTRIES 

225
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,890
ARE CONTINUING TO MEET, IF IT 

226
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,824
TAKES PLACE IN WASHINGTON, IT 

227
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:40,192
IS ALL TO THE GOOD, THOSE 

228
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,327
CONVERSATIONS ARE INCREDIBLY 

229
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,497
IMPORTANT. 

230
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,898
WE HAVE OUR SENIOR LEADERS 

231
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:51,571
MEETING ACROSS THE WORLD, IT IS 

232
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,404
VALUABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF 

233
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:58,077
UNITD STATES OF AMERICA, THAT 

234
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:58,778
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND TRUMP 

235
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,644
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE 

236
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:00,512
TO RESOLVE THE DIFFICULT ISSUES 

237
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:01,180
THAT ARE COUNTRIES FACE. 

238
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,614
I THINK THIS MAKES ENORMOUS 

239
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:04,116
SENSE, I AM HOPEFUL THE MEETING 

240
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,653
WILL TAKE PLACE THIS FALL.>> 

241
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,688
MR. SECRETARY, WHAT CONCRETE 

242
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:15,127
STEPS DO YOU NEED TO TAKE AN 

243
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,162
NORTH KOREA TO TAKE, TO SHOW 

244
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,530
THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO 

245
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:17,930
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

246
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,834
AND ON RUSSIA, THEY SAID THEY 

247
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,102
SENT A PROPOSAL TO WASHINGTON 

248
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,437
ABOUT THE RETURN OF MILLIONS OF 

249
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,673
SYRIAN REFUGEES, BASED ON AN 

250
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,007
AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED BY 

251
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:32,044
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND TRUMP, HAVE 

252
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,880
YOU SEEN THAT?>> I WILL TAKE 

253
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,183
THE SECOND ONE FIRST, LOTS OF 

254
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,452
DISCUSSION TAKING PLACE, A 

255
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:44,724
DISCUSSION BETWEEN PRESIDENT 

256
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,591
TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN ABOUT 

257
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,195
THE SYRIAN REFUGEE ISSUE, THE 

258
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,062
PRESIDENT SHARED WITH ME THE 

259
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,730
CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD, IT IS 

260
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,269
IMPORTANT TO THE WORLD THAT AT 

261
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,104
THE RIGHT TIME THROUGH A 

262
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,238
VOLUNTARY MECHANISM, THESE 

263
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,907
REFUGEES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

264
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:02,942
RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY, WE ARE 

265
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,510
WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM, SO 

266
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,777
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND PRESIDENT 

267
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,980
TRUMP DID DISCUSS THAT, LOTS OF 

268
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,383
WORK TO IMPLEMENT THAT, UNITED 

269
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,451
STATES WAS TO BE PART OF 

270
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,618
ACHIEVING THAT RESOLUTION IN 

271
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:15,688
SYRIA. 

272
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,555
YOUR FIRST QUESTION WAS ABOUT 

273
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,858
WHAT WE NEED TO SEE, IT IS 

274
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,395
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. 

275
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,429
IT IS NOT MY DESCRIPTION OF 

276
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,064
WHAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE, 

277
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,267
CHAIRMAN KIM MADE A PROMISE, HE 

278
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,003
TOLD NOT ONLY PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

279
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,606
BUT PRESIDENT MOON, THAT HE WAS 

280
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,910
PREPARED TO DENUCLEARIZE. 

281
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,944
THE SCOPE AND SCALE IS AGREED 

282
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:39,611
TO, THE NORTH KOREANS 

283
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:41,347
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS, 

284
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,381
THERE IS NO MISTAKE ABOUT WHAT 

285
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,182
THE SCOPE OF DENUCLEARIZATION 

286
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,684
LOOKS LIKE, WE NEED TO SEE 

287
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,519
CHAIRMAN KIM DO WHAT HE 

288
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,554
PROMISED THE WORLD HE WOULD DO. 

289
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,422
IT IS NOT FANCY, BUT IT IS THE 

290
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,893
TRUTH.

291
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:58,030
>> THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

292
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,065
>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

293
00:09:59,065 --> 00:09:59,932
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 

294
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,701
AND NIKKI HALEY, THE AMBASSADOR 

295
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,303
TO THE UNITED NATIONS, THEY MET 

296
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,639
WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL THIS 

297
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,640
MORNING, THE MAIN FOCUS WAS TO 

298
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,875
CONTINUE TO PUSH THE 

299
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,408
ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS 

300
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:11,811
AGAINST NORTH KOREA, MIKE 

301
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:16,816
POMPEO SAYING THAT CHAIRMAN KIM 

302
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,650
NEEDS TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH 

303
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,118
HIS PERSONAL COMMITMENT THAT HE 

304
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,154
MADE WITH DONALD TRUMP, THAT HE 

305
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,589
WOULD DENUCLEARIZE, THAT IS TO 

306
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,925
BE VERIFIED, BUT THERE SEEMS TO 

307
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,959
BE AN ISSUE OF THE VIOLATIONS 

308
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,827
OF THE SANCTIONS THAT NORTH 

309
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,195
KOREA IS ABLE TO PURCHASE 

310
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,730
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND THEY 

311
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,032
WANT TO SORT OF REINFORCE THE 

312
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,001
IDEA THAT THIS IS AN ILLEGAL 

313
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,238
ACTIVITY, PUSHING AN EFFORT TO 

314
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,773
ENCOURAGE MEMBER STATES, NOT TO 

315
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,542
BREAK THE SANCTIONS, AND CHINA 

316
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,077
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY RUSSIA, 

317
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:49,715
BLOCKED THAT EFFORT. 

318
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,750
THE REASON IT IS IMPORTANT IS 

319
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,617
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

320
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,152
TWEETING HIS APPRECIATION, OF 

321
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,787
HOW MUCH WORK RUSSIA HAS DONE, 

322
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,121
AND HOW RUSSIA HAS HELPED SO 

323
00:10:56,121 --> 00:11:00,025
MUCH WITH NORTH KOREA. 

324
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,227
SO IF THEY ARE HELPING, WHY ARE 

325
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,128
THEY BLOCKING AN EFFORT TO 

326
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:02,962
REINFORCE THE SANCTIONS, ONE OF 

327
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,329
THE MANY QUESTIONS TO BE 

328
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,766
ASKED.>>> FOR NOW, WE WILL TAKE 

329
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,134
A BIT OF A BREAK RIGHT NOW, WE 

330
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,668
WILL HAVE MORE NEWS TO COME, 

331
00:11:09,668 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
