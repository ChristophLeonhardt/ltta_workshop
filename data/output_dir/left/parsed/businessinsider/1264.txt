I think what will happen with the
president-elect is there going to be
certain elements of his temperament that
will not serve him well unless he
recognizes them and corrects them
because when you're a candidate and you
say something that is inaccurate or
controversial it has less impact than it
does when your brother the United States
everybody around the world's paying
attention markets move national security
issues require a level of precision in
order to make sure that you don't make
mistakes and I think he's be recognizes
that this is different and so do the
American people
