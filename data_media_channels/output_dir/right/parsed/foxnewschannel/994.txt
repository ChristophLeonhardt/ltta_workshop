2,000 HOMES HAVE BEEN EVACUATED
BECAUSE OF A FOREST FIRE THAT
HAS BURNED 30 SQUARE MILES SO
FAR.
SO A HANDSHAKE SEEN AROUND THE
WORLD AS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM
JONG-UN MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME.
SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THE PEOPLE OF
NORTH KOREA KNEW KIM WAS IN
SINGAPORE FOR THE SUMMIT WITH
THE COUNTRY'S MAIN NEWSPAPER
OFFERING STATE-DIRECTED
COVERAGE.
JOINING ME RIGHT NOW, BRIAN
McKEON.
LET ME START WITH YOU.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A
GENERAL FEELING THAT THE SUMMIT
DECLARATION IS LESS THAN
EXPECTED BUT IS IT A STEP IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION?
>> CERTAINLY THE MEETING IS AN
IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION AND NOW WE BEGIN A
PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION.
I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THAT.
I THINK THE STATEMENT WAS A
LITTLE LIGHT ON SUBSTANCE.
REMINDS ME OF THE PEGGY LEE SONG
"IS THAT ALL THERE IS?"
A LOT LESS DETAIL THAT HAVE BEEN
IN PRIOR STATEMENTS OF THIS
KIND.
>> Dana: IS THAT BECAUSE THE
PRESIDENT ENVISIONS -- HE SAID
EXPECTATIONS TO SAY, THIS IS
PROBABLY THE FIRST OF WHAT WILL
BE MANY MEETINGS THE COME?
>> YEAH, A LOT OF THE HARD WORK
REMAINS, DANA.
WE HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THIS
IMPORTANT FACT.
THE FIRST TIME IN THE 65 SOME
ODD YEARS SINCE THE END OF
THE -- THE CESSATION OF
CONFLICT.
THERE'S AN IMAGERY AND POMP AND
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT GOES JUST
BEYOND THIS MEETING AND GOES TO
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A LENGTHY
PROCESS AHEAD AND IT'S IMPORTANT
TO BEAR THAT IN MIND.
>> Dana: AND I DO THINK OF THE
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.
FEATURES COLOR PHOTOS OF KIM
JONG-UN WALKING AROUND
SINGAPORE, A BREATHTAKING CITY
WITH AN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY THAT
NORTH KOREANS CAN ONLY DREAM
ABOUT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE NORTH KOREA
REPORTED THIS SO QUICKLY.
USUALLY THEY TAKE DAYS TO REPORT
NEWS.
HERE THEY TOOK HOURS.
BASED ON YOUR EXPERTISE OF THE
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK THIS MIGHT
INDICATE?
>> IT INDICATES THAT KIM JONG-UN
IS FEELING CONFIDENT IN HIS
POSITION AND STEPPING FORWARD
AND HAVING TO INITIAL
NEGOTIATIONS WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
HE CERTAINLY WILL TAKE A VICTORY
LAP AT HOME TO SHOW HIS PEOPLE
THAT HE'S ADVANCING THEIR
SECURITY INTERESTING AND HE'S ON
THE WORLD STAGE AT A LEVEL WITH
THE LEADING COUNTRY IN THE
WORLD.
>> Dana: THERE'S OTHER NEWS WITH
THE TRADE SUMMIT THAT THE
PRESIDENT JUST CAME OUT OF WITH
THE G-7 SUMMIT.
HE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN HIS
PRESS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> THE PICTURE WITH ANGELA
MERKEL, THAT I GET ALONG WITH
VERY WELL, THAT PICTURE IS WE'RE
WAITING FOR THE DOCUMENT BECAUSE
I WANTED TO SEE THE FINAL
DOCUMENT AS CHANGED BY THE
CHANGES THAT I REQUESTED.
VERY FRIENDLY.
DIDN'T LOOK FRIENDLY.
IT WAS REPORTED LIKE NASTY BOTH
WAYS.
I WAS ANGRY AT HER.
ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST TALKING
THE WHOLE GROUP ABOUT SOMETHING
UNRELATED TO EVERYTHING.
VERY FRIENDLY WAITING FOR THE
DOCUMENT TO COME BACK SO I COULD
READ IT BEFORE I LEAVE.
>> Dana: I HAD SOME SYMPATHY FOR
THE PRESIDENT, SOMEONE LIKE
LOOKED AT A PHOTOGRAPH AND SAY
THAT'S NOT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT
HAS HAPPENED THERE.
DO YOU THINK THAT TENSIONS
AMONGST THE G-7 ARE NOT AS
DIFFICULT AS THE MEDIA HAS BEEN
REPORT SOMETHING.
>> YEAH, LOOK, IT'S VERY EASY
FOR FOLKS ON THE OUTSIDE TO
CRAFT A NARRATIVE AROUND THIS.
OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE SOME HURT
FEELINGS, SOME BACK AND FORTH
MAYBE BEFORE AND DURING THE
SUMMIT.
THE REALITY IS, ONLY THE FOLKS
IN THAT ROOM REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT WAS GOING ON.
THE DYNAMIC IS VERY COMPLICATED
RIGHT NOW.
THE UNITED STATES IS IN
UNCHARTERED TERRITORY WHEN WE
THINK ABOUT OUR TRADING
RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPANIES AS
WELL AS THE FACT AS THE
PRESIDENT REACHING OUT TO KIM
JONG-UN IN A HISTORIC MOMENT.
THE STATUS QUO HAS BEEN TURNED
UPSIDE-DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S PREMATURE FOR US TO DRAW
CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FREYING
ALLIANCES WITH EUROPE.
>> Dana: AND THE PRESIDENT
WANTED TO DEAL WITH NATO AND
THERE'S STARTING TO BE MOVEMENT
IN EUROPE.
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT SO MORE
AFTER THIS G-7 SUMMIT TO TRY TO
COUPLE TO THE TABLE WITH
SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY CAN SAY
THEY GAVE AND THEY WON A LITTLE
BIT?
THE ALLIANCE AND WITHIN OUR
CLOSE PARTNERS BECAUSE OF THE
PRESIDENT'S MOVE ON THE IRAN
DEAL AND THE PARIS CLIMATE
AGREEMENT AND WHAT HE'S DONE ON
TRADE.
YOU CAN'T REALLY -- SURE, WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT
ROOM AND THAT PICTURE, WHAT IT'S
ABOUT.
WE KNOW THERE'S REAL TENSIONS
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
ITS ALLIES.
COUNTRIES IN EUROPE ARE STEPPING
UP WITH INCREASED DEFENSE
SPENDING.
THEY DID THAT AFTER THE RUSSIANS
WENT TO CRIMEA AND THE EASTERN
UKRAINE.
THAT HAS CONTINUED AND IT'S A
GOOD THING.
>> Dana: LAST WORD TO YOU, LANNY
ON THIS TRADE ISSUE, ESPECIALLY
WITH THE NAFTA DEAL NOT SETTLED
EITHER.
>> RIGHT.
THAT IS A BIG CONCERN.
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH CANADA
AND MEXICO.
THAT IS DIFFICULT, PARTICULARLY
WHEN WE'VE BEEN OPERATING ON THE
NAFTA REGIME FOR TWO DECADES.
HOPEFULLY THEY CAN REACH AN
AGREEMENT AND HOPEFULLY MOVE THE
BALL FORWARD.
