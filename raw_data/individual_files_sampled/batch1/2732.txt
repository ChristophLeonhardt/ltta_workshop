this winding stairway leads to a place where time has Stood Still since 1994 this is old which underground station it's one of London's many abandoned tube stations but its history is more interesting than most the station has unique surviving features of London's Edwardian stations like the tiled signs by the Strand entrance the wooden ticket office windows the move gran oolitic flooring and the timber glad lifts it opened in 1907 and served the Piccadilly line but it only had one stop the trains could go from old which to hold water and back for some context it only takes six minutes to walk from old witch to Holborn I know what you think it why was the station constructed the only had one stop especially when that one stop was easily within walking distance it was originally meant to be the southern terminus of the Great Northern and Strand Railway which basically means it was meant to serve more than just one stop various changes in planning and route linking isolated oldrich leaving it a single station branch so what happened to it and why did he close the maintenance for the lifts the heavy price Tony weighed up against the amount of people that used the station on a regular basis on a daily basis they didn't equate to kind of putting the investment in so the station was closed when the station was closed in 1994 it was running an annual loss of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds and it needed major investment to replace the lifts the business case for neither could be made so what a TfL doing with the huge underground space now there's a lot of organizations that do training down here including the police and the fire brigade they use it for tours for public tours but the museum do and obviously filming or photographing shoots inside the station there is a 1972 tube train and it still works I mean you can study they were just don't don't touch anything yeah well I'm allowed to sit on the seat yeah just don't touch any of the controls buttons or anything yeah the train is often used during film shoots which is why it's been left operational like many other underground stations Aldwych was used as a bomb shelter during World War two but unlike other stations it was also used to hide treasures from the British Museum including the Elgin marbles this is the room where it was all hidden at the top of the station there are even public toilets this doesn't seem like exciting but Londoners will know that locating and LU on the tube is pretty difficult still working yeah mr. work Transport for London have no plans to reopen the station at this time but it will carry on being used for training and film shoes that means it will stay as it is a place where time Stood Still for decades you
