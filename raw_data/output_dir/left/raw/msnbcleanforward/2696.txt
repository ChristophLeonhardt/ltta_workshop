1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,026
JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER IN MEXICO.

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,128
BORDER IN MEXICO. HERE I AM IN TEXAS.

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,830
HERE I AM IN TEXAS. I WANT TO BRING IN A MAN WHO

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,065
I WANT TO BRING IN A MAN WHO KNOWS THIS REGION WELL.

5
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,700
KNOWS THIS REGION WELL. THE MAYOR, JIM DARLING.

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,035
THE MAYOR, JIM DARLING. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING DOWN

7
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:12,435
I APPRECIATE YOU COMING DOWN THIS MORNING.

8
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,770
THIS MORNING. CLEARLY RELATIONS WITH MEXICO

9
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,305
CLEARLY RELATIONS WITH MEXICO AND THE MIGRANT ISSUE IS A BIG

10
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,239
AND THE MIGRANT ISSUE IS A BIG ONE FOR YOU.

11
00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:22,145
ONE FOR YOU. SO LET’S GO BACK.

12
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:22,879
SO LET’S GO BACK. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESENTED

13
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:23,647
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESENTED THE IDEA OF THE BORDER WALL, HOW

14
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:24,347
THE IDEA OF THE BORDER WALL, HOW DID THAT SIT WITH YOU IN THIS

15
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:24,714
DID THAT SIT WITH YOU IN THIS COMMUNITY?

16
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:25,615
COMMUNITY? >> I THINK THE BORDER WALL

17
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,850
>> I THINK THE BORDER WALL ITSELF, WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH

18
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,853
ITSELF, WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THAT FOR LAND OWNER RIGHTS AND

19
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,021
THAT FOR LAND OWNER RIGHTS AND THOSE THINGS.

20
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,522
THOSE THINGS. AND I DON’T THINK IT AFFECTED A

21
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,556
AND I DON’T THINK IT AFFECTED A RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO UNTIL

22
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,925
RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO UNTIL HE SAID THEY’RE GOING TO PAY FOR

23
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:35,158
HE SAID THEY’RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT.

24
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,527
IT. AND THEN WE HAD A BACKLASH NOT

25
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,929
AND THEN WE HAD A BACKLASH NOT ONLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE WALL

26
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,063
ONLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE WALL IS GOING TO DO WITH OUR

27
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,865
IS GOING TO DO WITH OUR COMMUNITIES BUT RESENTMENT IN

28
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,567
COMMUNITIES BUT RESENTMENT IN MEXICO AFFECTING OUR VISITORS

29
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,968
MEXICO AFFECTING OUR VISITORS AND TOURISM.

30
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,871
AND TOURISM. WE’RE VERY STRONG ON TOURISM.

31
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,073
WE’RE VERY STRONG ON TOURISM. THAT HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON

32
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,241
THAT HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR ECONOMY.

33
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,676
OUR ECONOMY. >> WE NEED BORDER SECURITY AND

34
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,478
>> WE NEED BORDER SECURITY AND THE WALL WASN’T A BAD IDEA.

35
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,580
THE WALL WASN’T A BAD IDEA. HERE WE ARE WITH A MIGRANT

36
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,114
HERE WE ARE WITH A MIGRANT SITUATION.

37
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,181
SITUATION. THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE

38
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,383
THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE SAYING IT’S CLEARLY AN ISSUE,

39
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:00,851
SAYING IT’S CLEARLY AN ISSUE, BUT IT’S NOT A CRISIS.

40
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,486
BUT IT’S NOT A CRISIS. DO YOU VIEW IT AS A CRISIS?

41
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,254
DO YOU VIEW IT AS A CRISIS? WHEN I LOOK AT DETENTION CENTERS

42
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,789
WHEN I LOOK AT DETENTION CENTERS AND MOTHERS BEING SEPARATED FROM

43
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,357
AND MOTHERS BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN, I’M SAYING IF

44
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,760
THEIR CHILDREN, I’M SAYING IF IT’S NOT A CRISIS, WHY ARE WE

45
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,694
IT’S NOT A CRISIS, WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

46
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,865
DOING THIS? >> 2014 IT BECAME A CRISIS WHEN

47
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,166
>> 2014 IT BECAME A CRISIS WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKED ABOUT

48
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,001
PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKED ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM.

49
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,703
IMMIGRATION REFORM. THE CARTEL SAID IF YOU’RE NOT IN

50
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:21,438
THE CARTEL SAID IF YOU’RE NOT IN THE COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES,

51
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,474
THE COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES, YOU’RE NOT GETTING IN.

52
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,676
YOU’RE NOT GETTING IN. THE CRISIS IS IN CENTRAL

53
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:26,010
THE CRISIS IS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

54
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,278
AMERICA. PEOPLE THINK THEY’RE NOT GOING

55
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,212
PEOPLE THINK THEY’RE NOT GOING TO COME BECAUSE OF SEPARATION.

56
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,215
TO COME BECAUSE OF SEPARATION. WE HAVE TENS AND THOUSANDS OF

57
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,716
WE HAVE TENS AND THOUSANDS OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WHO GO

58
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:38,322
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WHO GO THROUGH A TRAUMATIC BYPASS

59
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,023
THROUGH A TRAUMATIC BYPASS THROUGH MEXICO WITH CARTEL

60
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:39,390
THROUGH MEXICO WITH CARTEL INFLUENCE.

61
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,190
INFLUENCE. TERRIBLE STORIES.

62
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,625
TERRIBLE STORIES. IF THEY’RE NOT GOING TO STOP FOR

63
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,794
IF THEY’RE NOT GOING TO STOP FOR THAT, THEY’RE NOT GOING TO STOP

64
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:44,295
THAT, THEY’RE NOT GOING TO STOP FOR THIS.

65
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,129
FOR THIS. I DON’T BELIEVE IN IT.

66
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:49,133
I DON’T BELIEVE IN IT. I THINK IT’S INEFFECTIVE AND

67
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,034
I THINK IT’S INEFFECTIVE AND INHUMANE

68
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:50,768
INHUMANE INHUMANE, BUT IT’S NOT GOING TO

69
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:51,335
INHUMANE, BUT IT’S NOT GOING TO AFFECT THE PROBLEM.

70
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,536
AFFECT THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE TO GO TO WASHINGTON

71
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,737
THEY HAVE TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND THEY HAVE TO GET TOGETHER

72
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,073
AND THEY HAVE TO GET TOGETHER AND DO IMMIGRATION REFORM.

73
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,540
AND DO IMMIGRATION REFORM. WE’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR

74
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:57,775
WE’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR FOUR YEARS IN OUR AREA.

75
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,443
FOUR YEARS IN OUR AREA. THIS IS NOT GOING TO STOP

76
00:01:59,453 --> 00:01:59,810
THIS IS NOT GOING TO STOP ANYTHING.

77
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,111
ANYTHING. >> IF THEY’RE FLEEING FOR THEIR

78
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,114
>> IF THEY’RE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES AND COMING TO THE BUT NOW

79
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,148
LIVES AND COMING TO THE BUT NOW WE’RE PUTTING THE CHILDREN IN

80
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,650
WE’RE PUTTING THE CHILDREN IN DETENTION CENTERS AND SEPARATING

81
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,151
DETENTION CENTERS AND SEPARATING THEM FROM THEIR MOTHERS, AND TO

82
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:09,353
THEM FROM THEIR MOTHERS, AND TO YOUR POINT, IT’S INHUMANE.

83
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,321
YOUR POINT, IT’S INHUMANE. IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE.

84
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,756
IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE. WHO EXACTLY DOES IT SERVE?

85
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,558
WHO EXACTLY DOES IT SERVE? WHEN I LOOK AT THE DETENTION

86
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,526
WHEN I LOOK AT THE DETENTION CENTERS AND READ THAT DHS IS

87
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:17,228
CENTERS AND READ THAT DHS IS SPENDING TENS AND MILLIONS OF

88
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,663
SPENDING TENS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, I THINK WOW, IF YOU

89
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,832
DOLLARS, I THINK WOW, IF YOU DROP TENS AND MILLIONS OF

90
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,033
DROP TENS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE AND DID SOMETHING

91
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:24,235
DOLLARS HERE AND DID SOMETHING FOR THE PEOPLE HERE, THAT MIGHT

92
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,470
FOR THE PEOPLE HERE, THAT MIGHT HAVE A BETTER EFFECT.

93
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:29,007
HAVE A BETTER EFFECT. >> IT TURNED THE IMMIGRATION AND

94
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,175
>> IT TURNED THE IMMIGRATION AND PEOPLE AT THE BORDER INTO

95
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:34,245
PEOPLE AT THE BORDER INTO IMMIGRATION OFFICERS.

96
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:37,282
IMMIGRATION OFFICERS. THAT’S AFFECTED THEIR

97
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:37,749
THAT’S AFFECTED THEIR OPERATIONS.

98
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,384
OPERATIONS. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE

99
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:41,853
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE SOCIAL WORKERS TO HELP THEM

100
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:42,654
SOCIAL WORKERS TO HELP THEM INSTEAD OF HAVING LAW

101
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:43,388
INSTEAD OF HAVING LAW ENFORCEMENT DO IT.

102
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,256
ENFORCEMENT DO IT. THAT’S BEEN A PARTICULAR

103
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:44,589
THAT’S BEEN A PARTICULAR PROBLEM.

104
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:47,926
PROBLEM. BUT I THINK THIS IS WHAT THEY

105
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,796
BUT I THINK THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY IS TRYING TO PREVENT PEOPLE.

106
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:52,497
SAY IS TRYING TO PREVENT PEOPLE. IF THE JOURNEY DOESN’T PREVENT,

107
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,165
IF THE JOURNEY DOESN’T PREVENT, THIS ISN’T GOING TO.

108
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,267
THIS ISN’T GOING TO. WE HAVE TO RUN THIS UNTIL THE

109
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:57,702
WE HAVE TO RUN THIS UNTIL THE PRESIDENT’S STAFF FIGURES OUT

110
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,270
PRESIDENT’S STAFF FIGURES OUT THIS IS NOT STOPPING THE FLOW,

111
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:01,206
THIS IS NOT STOPPING THE FLOW, AND EVEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

112
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:03,108
AND EVEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM, THAT’S GOING

113
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,609
IMMIGRATION REFORM, THAT’S GOING TO MAKE IT COME EVEN MORE.

114
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,177
TO MAKE IT COME EVEN MORE. >> ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS TO DO

115
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,512
>> ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS TO DO THIS IS THAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS

116
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,114
THIS IS THAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS THESE ARE CRIMINALS COMING IN,

117
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:10,715
THESE ARE CRIMINALS COMING IN, AND WE DON’T KNOW THAT, BUT HE

118
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,085
AND WE DON’T KNOW THAT, BUT HE ALSO SAYS THE MIGRANTS, THEY’RE

119
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,287
ALSO SAYS THE MIGRANTS, THEY’RE STEALING OUR JOBS.

120
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:16,521
STEALING OUR JOBS. THEY’RE IN YOUR BACKYARD.

121
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:17,923
THEY’RE IN YOUR BACKYARD. ARE THEY STEALING JOBS AND ARE

122
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,158
ARE THEY STEALING JOBS AND ARE THEY MAKING YOUR COMMUNITY

123
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,991
THEY MAKING YOUR COMMUNITY WORSE?

124
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,226
WORSE? >> WE’RE A SHRIMPING AREA.

125
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,961
>> WE’RE A SHRIMPING AREA. THE SHRIMPING FLEET WAS HURT

126
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,128
THE SHRIMPING FLEET WAS HURT BECAUSE WE DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH

127
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:25,931
BECAUSE WE DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO WORK FROM MEXICO.

128
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,866
PEOPLE TO WORK FROM MEXICO. >> YOU NEED MORE TO WORK ON YOUR

129
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:28,333
>> YOU NEED MORE TO WORK ON YOUR BOATS?

130
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:29,701
BOATS? >> WE DO, ABSOLUTELY.

131
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,536
>> WE DO, ABSOLUTELY. I KNOW IT’S A STOPGAP.

132
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,038
I KNOW IT’S A STOPGAP. IT’S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING

133
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:34,239
IT’S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING BUT PROBABLY INCREASE THE FLOW

134
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:35,440
BUT PROBABLY INCREASE THE FLOW BECAUSE THE CLOSER YOU GET TO

135
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:37,042
BECAUSE THE CLOSER YOU GET TO IMMIGRATION REFORM, PEOPLE ARE

136
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:38,010
IMMIGRATION REFORM, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE IN THE COUNTRY

137
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:39,845
GOING TO BE IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

138
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,346
BEFORE IT HAPPENS. >> THEN FROM HERE WHERE YOU’RE

139
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:42,647
>> THEN FROM HERE WHERE YOU’RE SAYING WE NEED IMMIGRANTS TO

140
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,915
SAYING WE NEED IMMIGRANTS TO FILL JOBS AND THESE PEOPLE

141
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,151
FILL JOBS AND THESE PEOPLE AREN’T HURTING YOUR COMMUNITY,

142
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:48,153
AREN’T HURTING YOUR COMMUNITY, WHAT IS THE SOLUTION OR WHAT DO

143
00:03:48,163 --> 00:03:49,621
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION OR WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE

144
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:50,455
YOU SAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE DETENTION CENTERS?

145
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:53,325
DETENTION CENTERS? >> IT TAKES SOME OF THE MONEY WE

146
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,327
>> IT TAKES SOME OF THE MONEY WE NEED TO DO FOREIGN POLICY IN

147
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:56,528
NEED TO DO FOREIGN POLICY IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

148
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:59,464
CENTRAL AMERICA. THE DRUG CARTELS HAVE MORE MONEY

149
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:01,366
THE DRUG CARTELS HAVE MORE MONEY THAN THE GOVERNMENT.

150
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:03,702
THAN THE GOVERNMENT. THEY SPEND MORE MONEY ON BORDER

151
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:04,069
THEY SPEND MORE MONEY ON BORDER SECURITY.

152
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:06,572
SECURITY. WE REALIZE THAT YOU CAN DO THESE

153
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:10,175
WE REALIZE THAT YOU CAN DO THESE LITTLE THINGS AND RHETORIC

154
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:12,644
LITTLE THINGS AND RHETORIC DOESN’T HELP.

155
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:14,947
DOESN’T HELP. WE NEED TO RESTORE THE ORDER OF

156
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:15,180
WE NEED TO RESTORE THE ORDER OF LAW.

157
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:17,349
LAW. BY THE WAY, THAT’S NAFTA GOING

158
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:18,182
BY THE WAY, THAT’S NAFTA GOING ACROSS THERE.

159
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:19,485
ACROSS THERE. RESTORE THE ORDER OF LAW IN

RESTORE THE ORDER OF LAW IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND HELP THE

00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:23,956
CENTRAL AMERICA AND HELP THE GOVERNMENTS DO THAT, AND BUILD

162
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,492
GOVERNMENTS DO THAT, AND BUILD OUR ECONOMY TO GIVE THEM A

163
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:27,092
OUR ECONOMY TO GIVE THEM A REASON NOT TO COME HERE.

164
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,694
REASON NOT TO COME HERE. >> HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT

165
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:29,862
