00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,840
ways little things nothing significant

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,260
but we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and together with a cross</font>

48
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,920
section of the UK community they're all

49
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> story I've put all</font>

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the links in the description box and I'm</font>

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,670

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,489
and when you've spent time in a hotel

56
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,850
with these people and you only move when

57
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,980
you leave by security taxis and you'll

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,600
separate from the world and finish the

59
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,070
show use and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back about one in</font>

60
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,470
the morning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you go to sleep</font>

61
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,420
after doing some promotion work so three

62
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,480
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep a night and it's constant</font>

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,950
final and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really intense and my</font>

65
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">vision has always been on you achieve</font>

66
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,860
about community and there's a lot of

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,079
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who talk about community but it's</font>

68
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,489
questionable is that really their

69
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,340
intention had lost people free

70
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,880
accusations my way am I genuine your

71
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,660
name do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care about humanity am</font>

72
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,450
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it just for myself and I guess</font>

73
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,070
with those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way I can</font>

74
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,780
prove it is if you meet up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

75
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,980
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who have met me in person</font>

76
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,980
can sort of defend me tula because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

77
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,820
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way you can't</font>

78
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,310
relay when you post up a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

79
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,579
website it's some ideas it's not the

80
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,440
person necessarily although they may be

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,239
honest but you're only focusing on

82
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,370
particular ideas when you meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> son in</font>

83
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,329
person you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to influence the</font>

84
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,970
conversation and ask questions which

85
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,880
allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly know in your own</font>

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,720
opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say a huge thank</font>

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,780
you to everyone who supported us<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

88
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,720
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

89
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,850
so so special to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and the other</font>

90
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,290
members and the community as a whole

91
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,570
online so I've always one of the proof

92
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,700
was just how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet can achieve</font>

93
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,950
anything and although a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

94
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,358
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really see it when we were doing</font>

95
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this show we got a lot of doing at times</font>

96
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,120
we got I love

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,530
got a lot of criticisms from across the

98
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,510
board of other acts of what a disgrace

99
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,130
it was we were allowed to be in it about

100
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we were cheating how we were making</font>

101
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,690
a joke<font color="#E5E5E5"> this competition how we weren't</font>

102
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,330
talented all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these sort of things and I</font>

103
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,220
guess that sir caters to the next level

104
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,200
and the fact that I stood there

105
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,210
alongside other people I mean in the

106
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,770
semi-finals I said how shocked I was

107
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,550
thank you and you hear people screaming

108
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,350
get a life you loser blah blah

109
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,360
blah if you can deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that I think</font>

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,890
he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with anything and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just when</font>

111
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,660
we heard the final result it's now time

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,370
um today I don't know what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font>

118
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,080
myself I<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoken with other members of</font>

setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this video I've been walking</font>

121
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,410
around the house not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what to do um</font>

122
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,960
I've got finals prayer for you need a

123
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,300
week oh that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

124
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,450
it happened too quickly and I don't know

125
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,610
how to explain it but I've had a vision

126
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,010
for online community for years now and

127
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,350
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've you know gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

128
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,260
incredibly of you know gatherings I've

129
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,230
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK I did stick aid for</font>

130
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,180
charity events and that was an emotional

131
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,580
thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the most emotional</font>

132
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,360
because it's it's the fact that there

133
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">are people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all across the world who</font>

134
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,020
spend their time together and they

135
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,290
believed in us and I just find that

136
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,980
absolutely remarkable and I can't

137
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,150
express my thanks enough people haven't

138
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,590
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> since primary school secondary</font>

139
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,620
school people who may have not spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

143
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,140
funny because I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told that for</font>

144
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,820
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years now and although I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font>

145
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,520
up a profile perhaps I always care about

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,140
sort of put myself above people people

149
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">who come into my room I'll spend the</font>

150
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,780
time I'll try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your names</font>

151
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,270
all this sort of stuff cuz people mean

152
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,270
the world to me and I'm I find it so

153
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,070
emotional and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you probably saw when</font>

154
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,420
we got that result I didn't say anything

155

<font color="#E5E5E5">and after four hours performing live on</font>

156

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:20,670
ultimate upstage champion and the winner

160
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:32,970
of the 10,000 pound prize is I was

161
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,790
almost in tears and is it was just the

162
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:41,700
pressure that and I've made videos likes

163
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,800
before but two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago over two years</font>

164
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,610
ago people didn't believe in me people

165
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,800
didn't understand things I was trying to

166
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,630
say and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help help</font>

167
00:07:51,630 --> 00:08:04,200
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to a point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my life which</font>

168
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,170
is overwhelming I don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

169
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,470
with myself today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saw him crying I</font>

170
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,919
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about crying but it just</font>

171
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,120
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me look rough but um this means a</font>

172
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,940
great deal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know a big</font>

173
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,490
criticism with us winning the show and I

174
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,230
go back to criticisms because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

175
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,360
it's fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put both perspectives in</font>

176
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,550
there so you know what was thrown us but

177
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,560
Don who we were against was a great guy

178
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,719
but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course he was doing stuff on an</font>

179
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,400
emotional basis people criticize that

180
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,080
there was no emotion behind what we did

181
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,360
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was because we were more</font>

182
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,770
focused on what we were doing and

183
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,020
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of back stories to us</font>

184
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">individually and as a group and for</font>

185
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,950
those here involved in the stage

186
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,530
community the specific you will know we

187
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">lost a great great supporter and this</font>

188
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,570
was definitely dedicated to the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

189
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,870
her we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention it on the show um</font>

190
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,640
cuz personally we didn't feel it was

191
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,960
right to sort of add to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> competition a</font>

192
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,610
strengthened emotional element but

193
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just the way we are and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

194
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,730
the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've played it all the</font>

195
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,030
way free by just doing what we do and

196
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,310
putting trust in the community and was

197
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,029
incredible<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> staged bloggers from the</font>

201
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,269
everything you know because it shows

202
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,579

<font color="#E5E5E5">the acts that took five is events but I</font>

206
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to say to anyone out there</font>

207
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're from today till the end of time</font>

208
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,140
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing what I'm doing is that my</font>

209
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,790
intentions are always for the best if

210
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,829
you don't like what I do I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

211
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hate you for it because we all have</font>

212
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,459
opinions<font color="#CCCCCC"> and different things if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

213
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,579
come across as arrogant or pretentious

214
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:05,200
it's not because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is because I'm</font>

215
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,260
passionate and when I accept that saying

216
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,790
that I can do can benefit other people

217
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,820
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to strive to that because</font>

218
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,290
surely if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did a positive thing you</font>

219
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,450
should keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going with that and that's</font>

220
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,410
what I plan on doing if people think

221
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,959
that I act godlike then I apologize

222
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I'm the same guy that was</font>

223
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,730
posting videos two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when i was</font>

224
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,450
getting 10 to 50 views per video it's

225
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,980
just it's on a wider audience and

226
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,010
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that you may think</font>

227
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,570
my hood mentality has changed but how

228
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,519
can I prove it to you then I just hope

229
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,779
to meet you<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

230
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,010
this on the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's to meet new</font>

231
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:51,370
people and to make differences as lame

232
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,230
as it sounds I don't care what I do in

233
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,940
my life I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop making a living</font>

234
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,760
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in life but as long as</font>

235
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,500
I'm helping people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all that</font>

236
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,589
matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me in life and I think that's</font>

237
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:03,670
something people really need to

238
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,320
understand is the core of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentality</font>

239
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,050
is um if other people happy then I'm

240
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,130
happy and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same of all passions</font>

241
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,720
in life people say it's so much effort

242
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do particular things if sounds</font>

243
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,500
passionate about it it doesn't feel like

244
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">an effort and I guess I just feel</font>

245
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,420
privileged that my<font color="#E5E5E5"> passion is in</font>

246
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,940
something which could possibly make me

247
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,149
live in and help other people I want to

248
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">become a counselor but I'd have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to study</font>

249
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,560
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 30 to do most of the</font>

250
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,899
things but if i can do it for a medium

251
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,060
like this where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can help people on a</font>

252
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,980
wide basis to help other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

253
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,589
spiral continues in that surely a good

254
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,829
thing

255
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,430
sure I'm channel on this video but I

256
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,260
just felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the early way to sort</font>

257
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,790
of help me get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back into the swing of</font>

258
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,990
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> because today I'm really</font>

259
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">struggling with getting back to everyday</font>

276
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,480
they left at the beginning or they stay

internet is more than just people who

284

spend too much time on the computer it's

285
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,940
a way in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can allocate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> resources</font>

286
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,850
and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people together who are isolated</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">because people are distant to each other</font>

people can't come together but the

internet you all can and we can achieve

292
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,020
things and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

294
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,180
upstage is a clear indicator that we

295
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
were surely dominant in his competition

296
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,180
not because we cheated not because we

297
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,820
bent the rules in a disgusting manner

298
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,339
not because it was rigged but<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

299

all understand how the community works

300

we realize if people want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch</font>

301
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,360
musical acts for six hours that they can

302
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,160
just watch a video online of what they

303
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">want no one would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> favourite</font>
