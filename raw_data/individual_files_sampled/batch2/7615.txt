sam brownback is the governor of kansas or he was i'm gonna tell you what i havend doom in a second and what he did was an epic disaster in Kansas and even Republicans admit that in fact they are now reversing his policies so he's got a new job and I want to tell you about that and this is gonna be great kansas governor sam brownback will leave that role as governor in favor of a job in the trump administration oh great yet another incompetent person joining the Trump administration that's what the White House announced on Wednesday so how bad is Brownback I mean he's a deeply Republican governor in a deeply Republican state of Kansas so and he got to do all the things that Republicans always promised which is tax cuts for the rich and corporations he did it and it was supposed to trickle down all over Kansas it did but not in the way that they were expecting so but still it's he's a Republican governor it's a Republican state say they should love what he did right new Sam Brownback should thank chris christie because he's the only reason why he's the second most unpopular governor in the country so he's coming in at number 49 because chris Christie's shutting down beaches in lying all over New Jersey so if you can't be a popular Republican Governor in Kansas you really suck at your job so he's I think he's at what 27 percent approval rating sixty-six percent disapproval those numbers are miserable by the way he's more unpopular than Rick Snyder who poisoned Flint Michigan this is unbelievable so why why did the Republicans in Kansas turn on him well he did tax cut bill in 2012 when he came he's like tax cuts for the rich yes and he did 3.7 billion dollars for over five years now for a state like Kansas that's a giant number but hey this is the experiment Republicans have been waiting for their whole lives you know you got you had the whole legislature you had the government you got to do whatever you want you did a giant tax cut for the top and so did it work because their idea is not a doesn't help their economy but once it helps the economy you could actually collect more revenue for the government no it won't create deficits that we just took 3.7 billion dollars out of the budget no no magically with fairy-dust great surpluses so did it so between 2014 and 2017 not the whole five year span 715 million dollars in deficits oops so then they had to pretty much butcher everything else in the budget because they got to get to balanced budget so there's now a 715 million dollar hole in the budget over those set of years in a small state like Kansas so there's throwing things overboard look I give you a dozen examples I'll just give you one education budget cuts in just one year in 2015 totaled forty four and a half million dollars so when you throw people's kids overboard because your dumbass tax cuts for the rich didn't work well then people start to get mad so and right before he left and I'm gonna tell you his job in a second in a stunning blow to Brownback's legacy and CPM reports Kansas legislators overrode the governor's veto in June to pass a bill reversing the income tax cuts that had come to haunt the state and mark Brownback's governorship so that is not a democratic legislature that is a deeply Republican legislature he vetoed it they overrode the veto they had to get almost everybody on board a huge majority on board to say no our Republican governor is a dumbass and those income tax cuts that we told you would work for the corporations and for for mainly the proceeds go to the rich only a small portion for the middle class and we told you they would eventually help the middle class they didn't it was a grotesque failure we Republicans in Kansas admit it was a failure we're gonna override his veto and make sure we don't do tax cuts anymore what have we been telling you all this time it doesn't work they had to they got everything they wanted they did their experiment and it was an epic failure so where's Brownback going now he has a very important job at the Trump White House he's going to be ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom if you're wondering what that is you're not alone that looks like a made-up job now it's not to be fair we looked into it Clinton administration passed a law that created this office for friends who are religious that you're an ambassador at large float away and what are you working on international how do you work on International Religious Freedom by the way if you want to do that you pick the wrong guy let's look at his record on that front Talking Points Memo explains the March of last year Brownback signed into law a measure enabling student groups at public colleges to discriminate on the basis of religion okay such that only Christian students for example could join a Christian Student Association now like you might agree with Hague only Christians should get to join Christian groups that's fine but what he did was say you are allowed to discriminate based on religion his new job is to make sure no one discriminates based on religion the ACLU of Kansas noted in a statement Wednesday that quote throughout his tumultuous tenure governor Brownback worked tirelessly to erode the protections that the First Amendment affords for separation of church and state the other thing the First Amendment does this it says you shall not establish a religion and you shall have freedom of religion because if you establish a religion which is also in other parts of the Constitution then you have eroded the freedom of other religions it's a simple concept one that sam Brownback doesn't understand hence why he got this job but overall look he's leaving for an incredibly unimportant job with almost no responsibility because he had to get the hell out of Dodge Dodge is actually in Kansas so it in this case is perfect he's like I don't want to be governor anymore this is so embarrassing please please get me anything and the Trump administration is like yeah okay hey we got this Sam come here so we actually have video here it's video 14 of Sam Brownback in his new important role Sam how's the rest of your political career going let's watch the track now echo Sam's well I think their ambassador at large is republicanism for you if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT
