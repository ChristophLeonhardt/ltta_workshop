when you hear that a water tanker is coming and you're in a heatwave without water tears I do not spend about a week now without water in our house in the foothills of the Himalayas the town of Shimla has run out of water residents say it's like living in an oven where they can't cook let alone shower we are suffering from the water crisis the whole community is only one Tiger comes but it's not enough we do not even get one bucket of water it is not just this area but in other areas as well it has been 2 to 3 weeks without water water tankers are being used across northern India but even that is rationed some people are allows just 5 litres of water a day in comparison when Cape Town was in drought earlier this year the limit was 10 times that the risk of waterborne illnesses increases when people try to live on less than 50 liters a day and northern India is seeing that firsthand oh he's suffering from vomiting diarrhea and fever the doctor has given him injections and put him on a saline drip now things are better nearly 500 kilometers from Shimla the muradabad district hospital was full of children sick from heat exposure and contaminated water patients come in here are suffering from a mix of viral and bacterial diarrhea 80% of the children coming into outpatient department are affected by seasonal communicable diseases it is my belief that the children are falling ill due to the rise in temperatures water shortages are not new in India the climate change is the country cracking under ever hotter summers the length of heat waves is increasing last year was India's fourth hottest on record and reservoir levels are at their lowest in a decade leaving drinking water out of reach just when it's needed the most Charlotte Bellis al-jazeera
