Donald Trump loves to talk about fake news anytime anyone in the media writes something that appears to be critical Trump just brushes it off as false reporting and fake however it turns out that him repeatedly saying that is kind of working and some Americans do believe that the media is fabricating stories about Trump and his administration so Politico and morning consult did a poll on this and here's what they found if you look at all voters you take a representative sample and look at all voters it turns out that 46% of voters say yes the media is making up stories about Trump 37% say no and 17% are undecided look this is really important they're not saying that the media is biased and slanting the stories or giving their opinion on the stories they're saying that the news media is fabricating the stories fabricating just making it up out of whole cloth so in fact Donald Trump did have a record-breaking size that is inauguration but the news media got together and decided to fabricate that it that the crowds were not that big and they fabricated the pictures I mean I'm just giving you one example are we fabricating his tweets - are we fabricating things that he says on television himself I mean anyway okay it's just absurd because even if we did absolutely no reporting whatsoever he says things himself he tweets he can't stop himself from tweeting he attacks people he gets involved in these ridiculous like non issues and these fights anyway all right let's focus on Republicans Democrats independents yada yada what do they think like when you divvy it up when you divvy up the voters and look at their ideological background what do they think in regard to news coverage on Trump when it comes to Republicans of course the vast majority think that the media is fabricating stories about them 76% of Republican voters say yes there are fabrications in the media on Trump 11% say no well okay so let's pause there for a second now you're gonna say okay yeah of course the problems believe that more now let's pause the note that 3/4 of Republicans in this country have lost their minds so if you say the corporate media is buying so I'm going to agree with you guys I'm not trying to defend their bias and then you know I've said this a million times I think they have an establishment bias the status quo is great they work for a multi-billion dollar corporation but I also have worked there I I know a lot of those folks I know how the system works they don't just sit in a room and go what can we make up about anyone whether it's Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders who I really like no they they are slanted they think Bernie Sanders should be President they will take something he said and twist his words a little bit right so I understand that I feel your pain if you think they're biased whether we're on the same side or not but they don't go in a room and go let's just make up a story about Bernie Sanders at a whole cloth let's just imagine it and you know don't worry our editors won't fire us for fabricating a story they don't do it about Trump and three-quarters of Republicans in this country believe something that isn't remotely true then we've lost them we've lost them they don't live in this reality they live in an alternate reality so the numbers are different when it comes to Democrats only 20 percent of Democrats believe that the media is fabricating stories about Trump in the administration sixty-five percent say no sorry real quick pause there to 20 percent of Democrats think the media is inventing stories fabricating stories about Trump oh my god the media has lost all credibility no no it's gonna get it's about to get a lot worse and and also it's something that I think everyone regardless of your ideology should be concerned about because this is you know this is like the road map to a tyrannical government and the reason why I say that is because the media is so important in holding elected officials accountable whether they're on the right or the left it doesn't matter journalism is important right and if you have an American electorate that is distrustful of the media doesn't see the value of journalism you are essentially paving the way for someone like Trump to do some pretty terrible things so group very quickly when it comes to independence 44% believe the media is making up stories about Trump 31% say no we've lost independence yeah independence there are actually now real before they were just you know they were to some degree Republican leaning for a long time the independents are now true independence and and they do decide elections I've seen that happen right in front of my eyes over the course of the last decade or so and and partly because people are no longer attached to party labels like they were in in earlier times and if you've lost independence that's really bad news and for the majority of Independence or at least the plurality of Independence to say yes the news media is liars who just make up stories about Trump well that's a really bad news and we didn't invent that so just to give you more bad news and what I would argue is the scariest part about all of this there are Americans who believe that the government Trump specifically should have the ability to take licenses away from news organizations now if you could recall recently Trump criticized NBC News and said that NBC News should have its license revoked and apparently there are Americans who think that the president should have the power to do that let's go to graphic 18 now it's a small portion of the country overall but it still concerns me twenty-eight percent think the government should have the power to revoke broadcast licenses of major news organizations that it says are fabricating news stories about a president or the administration while fifty-one percent think the government should not be able to do that another 21 percent are undecided so here are specific numbers that are tied to parties more than two-thirds of Democrats 68 percent think the federal government should not have the power to revoke broadcast licenses of those organizations only 68 percent like what's go going on you like there are Democrats that think that it's okay for the government to revoke licenses from news organizations that it doesn't like you're gonna allow them to be the arbiter of what is and is not fabricated news and have the power to revoke their licenses what is wrong with you that is fucking insane that is so incredibly devastating like Democrats okay well we've completely lost it so let's go on to Republicans 46% of Republicans think the government should have the power and 1/3 of GOP voters who don't think so so 1/3 of GOP voters say no shouldn't have the power to do that but but 46% of Republicans believe yeah yeah definitely the government should have the power to revoke licenses from news organizations that it doesn't like okay so if you're in that camp who believes that you're on American you are it's one of the most central parts of our government but the First Amendment guarantees the freedom of the press if you don't agree first of all if you don't think that we should apply the First Amendment I assume that you will immediately agree that we also should not apply the Second Amendment oh wait you you like to pick and choose among amendments I thought you were constitutionalist right-wingers no you don't love the Constitution you don't love this country you don't love our system you guys are throwing feces at one another over ben shapiro giving a speech at Berkeley right because oh my god this is a violation of our constitutional amendments if they don't allow him to speak which by the way again for the billing it's time I agree with that he should be allowed to speak and Coulter should be allowed to speak whatever deplorable individual you want on that campus should be allowed to speak but at the same time you're gonna turn around and say that the government should be able to revoke licenses for media organizations that it doesn't like so Wow so that's deeply disturbing for what Americans think how Donald Trump has driven that narrative and unfortunately it's worked he recently did a tweet Amy you know he said fakeness a million times and he accused CNN and on all the rest of being quote fiction writers he just tweeted that the other day but there is one other factor here and and one other party that's responsible and that is the mainstream media and so now there are a lot of things that I disagree with the major you know I've done stories about a thousand morning job mistakes and and and the way that they frame it they're preposterous they talk about what the American people think and they don't back it up with polling I did want to uncheck Todd it Center do I think that NBC's license should be taken away are you insane no I also can speak and I could show you their clip and then I could show you our clip that I could show your data to prove us right that is called more speech and by the way you're allowed to do the same exact thing you're allowed to do it on YouTube Facebook anywhere you like and you could even make stuff up and you often do on the right wing over and over and over again and then turn around and go can you believe people are making stuff up okay are you kidding me look at the right wing blogs half of it on that half the stuff on there is made-up and we're not talking about ending their freedom of speech even though they consistently actually lie oh by the way you know that journalists can get sued at any time for defamation like we have laws that prevent people from flat-out lying about people whether it's an elected official or a private citizen if you are found guilty of defamation laws you're gonna face some serious consequences for that no one is allowed to just fabricate stories about anyone okay there are already laws preventing that from happening do journalists sometimes get facts wrong absolutely they're humans and should they get criticized for that yes but to say that they're making up stories about the president is absolutely ludicrous and quite honestly it makes me feel like we're just wasting our time right like what are we doing we're wasting our time they just did they don't want to believe it because it goes against what they already believe their preconceived notions no no we have to win the independence and that is why I'm so mad at the establishment media because they don't need you refuse to acknowledge their bias and thereby hurt the rest of the media because they keep saying oh we're neutral we're objective we have no bias at all and for some of them that's absolutely true and a lot of the print guys are terrific Reuters McClatchy The Guardian and intercept I can go on and on and on right but for cable news guys and for a lot of the broadcast news guys they say the status quo they do they do but they don't recognize it they think that everything is wonderful we shouldn't have too much change everyone on the left is a radical everyone on the right is a radical and they say it and they pound that message home all the day now I don't care I don't care in that I'm not going to shut him down for it I disagree with them that's okay but when they say that that they have a monopoly on the truth and the truth is that the status quo is great what the rest of the country hears is screw you you're not on my side and when I say that to the establishment media they get really angry but knuckleheads weren't unlike these guys we're not trying to tear you down we're trying to make it better so that people actually trust you again but if you keep telling everybody that anyone who wants changes of radical and people like Hillary Clinton and and by the way Mike Pence and we established Republicans in establishment Democrats are awesome and they're honorable gentlemen and that we should go back to the middle and keep doing what their donors say when you do ridiculous things like pretend that money in politics doesn't matter no these are honorable gentlemen having a debate in Congress they're not having a debate they took a check and then they did what their donors told them to do when you pretend things like that you lose all credibility and what you're doing and unfortunately is helping the other side attack the core principles of America and helping them destroy the freedom of the press you're not helping you're hurting we're trying to fix it but I I don't know that we're ever gonna get through the establishment press or to the right wing or now even some Democrats who think no they just get in a room have like fantasy time make up random stories and then print them or put them on TV man this is incredibly embarrassing and and depressing and by the way and no matter what you guys are saying and honestly what we're saying Trump is at 44% now for most presidents that's a really bad number but for him he's climbing he was in the mid 30s he's going up to 44% man they are just folks in America are not listening the media the media has been overwhelmingly negative to trump and people are going I don't care I like him anyway all right enjoy what he's about to do to your life and what he's been doing to your life to be quite honest enjoy it yeah have fun unfortunately will be proven right again about Trump but it won't be pretty in the meanwhile help us build independent media together TYT Network comm / join
