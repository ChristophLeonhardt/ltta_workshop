1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,460
A funny thing happens if you travel
north in January.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,420
Go far enough and it gets dark in the
middle of the day.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,440
This is what the brief winter daylight looks like in northern Norway.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,060
That's where I meet up with a team of researchers bound for the Arctic Ocean.

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm Eli Kintisch and I'm spending two
weeks with scientists

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,620
exploring the Arctic during the polar night.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,520
The time of year that brings 24-hour darkness.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,140
We're here in the dark to study 
the Arctic ecosystem before

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,800
the ice that defines it disappears.

10
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,140
Seasons are supercharged in the Arctic.

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,640
As the Earth orbits the Sun,

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,580
the amount of light reaching the northern
hemisphere changes.

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,160
You may have noticed your days shrinking in the winter,

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,140
but it's way more drastic near the North Pole.

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,840
Where for four months the Sun never
rises above the horizon,

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,275
and then in the summer,
 the Sun never sets.

17
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,420
The sea ice floating on the Arctic Ocean

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,660
follows a similar pattern.

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,300
Growing in the fall and
winter and melting in the spring

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,134
when the massive spring blooms of algae 
feed the ecosystem.

21
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:27,390
But alongside those drastic seasons,

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,620
scientists have also detected 
a long-term trend that's underway.

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,800
Back here on earth, new word
that the Arctic sea ice

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,020
has melted to near record levels.

25
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,140
Global warming will leave the Arctic ice free

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,400
during the summer within two decades.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Look at where the sea ice was in the 1980s

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,360
compared to the first decade of the 2000s.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,840
And this line shows the data from 2018 so far.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,500
Twenty years ago, the part of the sea we
explored on the Helmer Hanssen

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,560
would have been coated with ice three to six feet thick.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,140
We visit 22 stations on our journey

33
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,000
collecting measurements and samples

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,700
to gauge the health of the ecosystem

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,100
before the light returns in the spring.

36
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,520
Scientists have mostly ignored the Arctic winter

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,680
assuming that life here is dormant 
during the dark months.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,260
But when they looked closer, they found
 an ecosystem teeming with life.

39
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,200
The mission of this journey is to track 
the physical and biological

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,000
aspects of the ocean as the ice vanishes above it.

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,880
Water samples from the deep
helped scientists

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,160
identify currents that may be changing.

43
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,420
Robotic gliders roam the sea for months

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,980
measuring the properties of water

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,600
and probing for signs of life.

46
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,700
You've probably heard that big arctic species like

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,420
polar bears are endangered by the melting ice,

48
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,020
but tiny creatures also rely on it.

49
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,780
Some types of algae cling to its surface

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,700
and when they die, they fall to the muddy sea floor

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,260
becoming food for mollusks, worms, and crustaceans

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,760
and those creatures are food
for fish, seals, and ...

53
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,280
walruses.

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Stir crazy scientists really like walruses.

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,160
Other scientists zap the water with light to

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,000
detect algae cells and measure their response.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,820
Animals called zooplankton just a few millimeters long

58
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,480
come up in the nets.

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,320
And the scientists test how they behave

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,580
under different light and water conditions.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,980
They also document which species are present

62
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,980
and how many. As do the team's studying fish.

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,020
Without this data we won't be able to measure

64
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,460
how less ice and more light will change the ecosystem.

65
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,139
Shrinking sea ice means more light reaches

66
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,560
the Arctic Ocean in the spring and fall.

67
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,440
And that light is fueling massive new

68
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,700
blooms of algae called phytoplankton.

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,000
That's already helping several species of whales

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
thrive in the Arctic.

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,200
But will the extra light benefit the
entire ecosystem in the future?

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,260
It depends.

73
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,040
These nutrients like nitrogen and phosphate

74
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,960
are found naturally in the ocean.

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,860
They nourish the algae like fertilizer for a garden.

76
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,020
But we don't know whether their levels will rise

77
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,180
along with all the new sunlight.

78
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,980
As the light floods in a separate problem 
is disruptions in timing.

79
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,000
The blooms are coming earlier in
the spring on average.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,700
But if they appear too early baby zooplankton that

81
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,740
hatch later could go hungry. And fish populations in turn

82
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,800
would diminish as well.

83
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,600
The Arctic has undergone massive changes before.

84
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,340
But carbon pollution is causing Arctic

85
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,300
summer temperatures to rise
faster than they have in 1,500 years.

86
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,560
It is too soon to know how severe these
disruptions

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,420
will be on the ecosystem.

88
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,980
So scientists will return to the same
stations in the spring and early summer

89
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,180
to monitor a rapidly changing landscape.

90
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,640
Thanks for watching Thaw.

91
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,760
The next episode in this three-part series

92
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,560
we'll look at how the Arctic could be affecting

93
00:05:57,560 --> 00:00:00,000
weather across the world.
