Tucker: THE SOVIET BLOC COLLAPSED NEARLY 30 YEARS AGO BUT LIVES ON NEW YORK COLLEGE CAMPUS. MORE THAN 200 SCHOOLS MAINTAIN WHAT THEY CALLED BIAS AND RESPONSE TEAMS. THEIR JOB IS TO INVESTIGATE THOUGHT CRIMES THE STUDENTS MAY HAVE COMMITTED. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, STUDENTS ARE URGED TO SPY ON THEIR PEERS AND MAKE ANONYMOUS REPORTS IF THEY SEE OR HEAR ANYONE USING THE WRONG WORDS OR THINKING UNAPPROVED THOUGHTS. THE SCHOOL IS BEING SUED BY ADVOCATES FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT WHO POINT OUT THAT CREEPY THOUGHT POLICE PROBABLY VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. PRESIDENT OF SPEECH FIRST WHICH BROUGHT THAT LAWSUIT, JOINS US TONIGHT TO EXPLAIN IT. THAT I OVERSTATE THAT? BIAS RESPONSE TEAM FACE WILL POPPED UP THE YOU CAN REPORT SPEECH. NOT EVEN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO, BUT THAT YOU'VE OVERHEARD. MAYBE WHAT YOU AND I ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TV SHOW. SOMEBODY WALKS BY OUR WALKING BY AND THEY THINK I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD AND WE WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE BIAS RESPONSE TEAMS AND WE WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN OURSELVES. Tucker: YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE POLICE IF SOMEONE REPORTS YOU FOR SAYING SOMETHING UNAPPROVED. SO WHAT IF YOU SAY I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THIS KIND OF THING AND I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU AND BUZZ OFF? YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO PUNISHMENTS, WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE REMEDIATION, THEY CALL IT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO CULTURAL APPROPRIATION TRAINING OR SOME OTHER KIND OF DIVERSITY UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING WHICH I HEAR IS A THING THESE DAYS.

THERE'VE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT IT, THE FOUNDATION HAS DONE INCREDIBLE WORK. Tucker: WHAT ABOUT THE A ACLU? THEY HAVEN'T WAITED ON THIS. Tucker: I THOUGHT THEY CARE ABOUT FREE SPEECH THOUGH? DAVIS STEPPED BACK ON THAT RECENTLY. WE DECIDED TO BRING A LAWSUIT. LET'S DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND. WE ARE A MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION SO WE HAVE THREE STUDENTS ON THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ON THE CAMPUS WHO HAVE ENROLLED WHO HAVE DECIDED LET'S PUSHED BACK. WE WILL BE REPRESENTING THEM AS OUR ASSOCIATION BECAUSE THEY ARE SCARED, WITH GOOD REASON. THEY DON'T WANT THEIR NAMES OUT THERE. Tucker: WHAT IS THE UNIVERSITY 'S POSITION ON THIS? IT DOESN'T COVER COLLEGE CAMPUSES OR DO THEY HAVE AN ARGUMENT? THEY HAVEN'T RESPONDED TO US YET. WE WILL BE FILING FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. WE HOPE TO HALT ON THE PROGRAMS UNTIL WE CAN COME TO THE CONCLUSION WHETHER RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED. Tucker: DID YOU PUT THE UNIVERSITY OUT OF BUSINESS AND MAKE SURE IT NEVER RISES AGAIN FROM THE ASHES? AS YOU SAID BEFORE THERE ARE OVER 200 SCHOOLS THAT HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. Tucker: I HOPE YOU CRUSH THEM ALL BECAUSE THIS IS A THREAT TO EVERYTHING THAT WE
