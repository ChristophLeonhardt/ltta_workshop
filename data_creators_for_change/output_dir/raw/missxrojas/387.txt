blogging<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my coat on again what</font>

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,000
could it mean by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rick pile of books</font>

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,380
recently and they're two very different

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,029
genres there's a 911 genre which is

5
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,740
dissertation relatedness the children's

6
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,880
book genre which is somewhat different

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,620
so my elective module is children's

8
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,120
literature and so far infrared buy shoes

9
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,009
and I capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> castle and autumn time</font>

10
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,389
so as it happens we didn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

11
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,310
sea I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Jamaica and a comment</font>

12
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,420
products but we've read a lot of books

13
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,710
so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three every</font>

14
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,090
week and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this week's books were Brennan</font>

15
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,619
chase and hatchet I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really very</font>

16
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,330
inspired<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the ending of hatchet and I</font>

17
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,039
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the brighter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

18
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,779
inspired<font color="#CCCCCC"> by himself with a lot of them</font>

19
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this series although at first I</font>

20
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,029
thought was kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> along the Flies</font>

21
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,590
effect of taking out and realizing that

22
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,668
it was a child<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's something</font>

23
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,020
very it wasn't very sad actually about

24
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,040
the ending whereas there are lots of

25
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,420
really satisfactory bits throughout

26
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,100
hatchet is about a 13 year old boy

27
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,480
called Brian his parents are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,809
and little<font color="#CCCCCC"> plane the pilot has a heart</font>

30
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,370
attack and the plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> crash lands into</font>

31
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,200
the lake this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the wilds of</font>

32
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,660
Canada that wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> area he has this one</font>

33
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,190
little hatchet this is what acts that

34
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,570
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> mother has given him it becomes this</font>

35
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,070
maze essential tool becomes quite a

36
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,539
large space of time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does it very</font>

37
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,010
quickly I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the size of the</font>

38
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,219
text and as I think 150 354 pages i was

39
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,390
really bowled over with bits of it

40
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,559
especially the parts that talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

41
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,910
tough hope but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't completely</font>

42
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">convinced but I thought was a really</font>

43
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">great example of compact storytelling</font>

44
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,080
something that isn't necessarily a short

45
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,729
story was a bit longer than that so

46
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,290
that's hatchet the other why<font color="#CCCCCC"> read was</font>

47
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,549

connected in circumstances and

117
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
everything was absolutely excellent if

118
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,140
you are personally extremely affected by

119
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,760
their 911<font color="#CCCCCC"> tax</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably not one for</font>

detailed descriptions or phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> calls</font>

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,970
exactly what was going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people get</font>

124
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,170
trapped in this like that that is

125
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,329
extremely difficult to read this is 600

126
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:13,890
pages or so it's got really good notes

127
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,090
to the back I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> the book is in</font>

128
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,680
some sense structured around the events

129
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,030
of 911 it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard when you're</font>

130
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,410
looking back at everything that built up

131
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,239
to it to say how do people not see this

132
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,010
for example there was Richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clark and</font>

133
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the government working at the time who</font>

134
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,879
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very aware and onkyo about the risks</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> al-qaeda and and on various occasions</font>

this wise<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention to this</font>

Rice a week before the 911 attacks

140
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,959
saying we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be serious what is</font>

141
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,549
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our angle al-qaeda do we think</font>

142
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,049
it's a strat r you need to decide the

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,069
moves<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but you want to reach</font>
