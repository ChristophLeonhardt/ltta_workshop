41
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,810

42
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that another thing that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do is</font>

44
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,290
going to be is Vicki and I are gonna get

45
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,580
a challenge that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

46
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,620
against each other and then we're going

47
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,899
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> record ourselves both cameras we're</font>

48
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,239
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to record ourselves doing that</font>

51
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,879
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is called parent</font>

of us ranting like about a parrot thing

55
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,860
and it probably won't be so funny to

56
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,660
people that aren't parents but I think

57
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,190
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really funny for people</font>

58
