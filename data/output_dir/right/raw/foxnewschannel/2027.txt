1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,387
THEY DON'T MENTION IMPEACHMENT.

2
00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:04,156
THEY USE ON USE UNELECTED

3
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:05,324
BUREAUCRATS WITH GUNS TO CROSS

4
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:05,958
THE PRESIDENCY.

5
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:07,092
THE WORST PART IS THAT IT'S

6
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:09,061
WORKING.

7
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:10,829
BYRON YORK FOR THE

8
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,698
"WASHINGTON EXAMINER."

9
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:15,200
JONATHAN TURLEY, THEY BOTH JOIN

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,601
US TONIGHT.

11
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,769
PROFESSOR, FIRST TO YOU, WHY NOT

12
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,972
JUST SAY WE WANT TO IMPEACH THE

13
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:20,839
PRESIDENT, WE THINK WE'VE

14
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:21,974
COMMITTED HIGH TIME, CRIMES AND

15
00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:22,841
MISDEMEANORS, THEY DO THINK

16
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:23,942
THAT.

17
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:25,777
WHY SHOULD THAT BE EMBARRASSING,

18
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:27,379
IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURE?

19
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:28,180
>> THEY CERTAINLY SHOULD BE OPEN

20
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,982
ABOUT IT IF THAT IS THEIR

21
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:30,382
MOTIVATION.

22
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:31,617
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE

23
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:32,384
PREFERRED ROUTE FOR THE

24
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:34,520
CONSTITUTION IS TO HAVE A TRIAL

25
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,254
IN THE SENATE AFTER IMPEACHMENT

26
00:00:35,254 --> 00:00:37,723
IN THE HOUSE, TO HAVE THAT

27
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:38,323
DECISION.

28
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:39,525
YOU CAN ALWAYS STILL IMPEACH

29
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:41,326
SOMEONE ONCE THEY ARE REMOVED

30
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:41,727
FROM OFFICE.

31
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:44,229
THERE IS AN ONGOING ACADEMIC

32
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,863
DEBATE WHETHER ANY SITTING

33
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:47,799
PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED BUT

34
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,301
MOST PROSECUTORS YIELD TO THE

35
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:49,902
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

36
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:51,537
>> Tucker: THERE'S NO DEBATE

37
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:52,704
OVER WHAT'S THE MOST DEMOCRATIC

38
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:53,605
MECHANISM FOR DEALING WITH THE

39
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:54,540
PRESIDENT WHO'S DONE SOMETHING

40
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,142
WRONG, IT'S BY USING THE

41
00:00:57,142 --> 00:00:57,809
REPRESENTATIVE THAT VOTERS

42
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,179
ELECTED, CORRECT?

43
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:00,946
>> THAT'S THE PREFERRED WAY.

44
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:02,648
THE FACT IS THAT THE FRAMERS

45
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:05,050
GAVE US A PROCESS BY WHICH WE

46
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,751
COULD FIRST IMPEACH AND THEN

47
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:07,119
REMOVE THE PRESIDENT.

48
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,388
AS LONG AS YOU CAN PROVE HIGH

49
00:01:09,388 --> 00:01:10,889
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, CLEARLY

50
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:11,557
SOME DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS ARE

51
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:12,958
RUNNING ON THAT.

52
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,661
I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM, FRANKLY

53
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,129
WITH TRUMP ALSO RUNNING ON THAT.

54
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:19,398
I THINK FOR HIM TO SAY THIS IS

55
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:20,933
ABOUT MY IMPEACHMENT, I HAVE NO

56
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:22,034
PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE

57
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:23,702
OBVIOUSLY THAT IS AN UNDERLYING

58
00:01:23,702 --> 00:01:26,738
NARRATIVE FOR THE OTHER SIDE.

59
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:29,508
BUT I THINK WHAT WILL HAVE TO

60
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:30,209
HAPPEN FIRST IS MUELLER WILL

61
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:33,912
HAVE TO ISSUE A REPORT AND THEN

62
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:35,514
IF CONGRESS CHANGES HANDS,

63
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:36,415
PARTICULARLY IN THE HOUSE, YOU

64
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:38,517
COULD VERY WELL SEE THE

65
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:39,084
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

66
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:41,320
>> Tucker: THE QUESTION OF THE

67
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,987
SUBPOENA, WE SAW YET ANOTHER

68
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:44,523
PIECE OF INFORMATION LEAKED IN

69
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:46,658
THE PRESS RECENTLY THAT THE

70
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:48,493
MUELLER PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING

71
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:50,095
SUBPOENAING A PRESIDENT.

72
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:52,130
AT THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING WE

73
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,131
MAY REJECT THAT.

74
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:53,932
WHERE DOES IT STAND?

75
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:55,033
>> THAT'S WHERE IT STANDS RIGHT

76
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:55,534
NOW.

77
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:56,602
WE DON'T KNOW IF MUELLER IS

78
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:57,803
REALLY GOING TO DO THIS.

79
00:01:57,803 --> 00:02:01,206
WE HAVE NEVER HAD THIS COME TO A

80
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:02,274
CONFLICT IN HISTORY.

81
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:04,276
THE NIXON CASE WAS ABOUT

82
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:05,877
SUBPOENAING DOCUMENTS ABOUT

83
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:07,946
EVIDENCE, NOT ACTUALLY TESTIMONY

84
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:08,747
EVIDENCE, NOT ACTUALLY TESTIMON

85
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:09,114
TESTIMONY.

86
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:10,282
WITH BILL CLINTON, KEN STARR

87
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:11,049
SUBPOENAED BILL CLINTON AND THEN

88
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,918
THEY WORK SOMETHING OUT SO THAT

89
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:15,520
KEN STARR WOULD WITHDRAW THE

90
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,722
SUBPOENA WHILE BILL CLINTON

91
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,557
TESTIFIED, BUT HE DID GET A FEW

92
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:20,726
THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NOT GET

93
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,261
IT, HE GOT TO KEEP HIS LAWYERS

94
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,395
IN THE ROOM WITH HIM.

95
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:25,764
IF HE DID IT ON VIDEO.

96
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:26,932
HE DIDN'T GO TO A GRAND JURY

97
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:28,734
ROOM, AND THE TIME WAS LIMITED.

98
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:30,569
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE ACTUALLY

99
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:31,003
DID TESTIFY.

100
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:32,070
I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

101
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,806
RIGHT NOW WITH THIS CASE IS THAT

102
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,976
TRUMP IS REALIZED, PERHAPS THAT

103
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,978
THIS IS MORE OF A POLITICAL

104
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:40,946
FIGHT, THIS IS AN IMPEACHMENT

105
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:43,548
FIGHT MORE THAN ANYTHING.

106
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:44,750
WHILE HIS LAWYERS TALKED ABOUT

107
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,918
WHETHER A PRESIDENT CAN OR

108
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,754
CANNOT BE SUBPOENAED OR CALLED

109
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:49,921
TO TESTIFY, RUDY GIULIANI, WHO

110
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,157
IS REALLY MORE OF A SPOKESMAN

111
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:54,726
RIGHT NOW, AND OTHERS, ARE

112
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:55,961
WORKING TO DISCREDIT THE

113
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,062
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, OR THE

114
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:57,996
SPECIAL COUNSEL IN THIS CASE

115
00:02:57,996 --> 00:02:59,064
BECAUSE IF IT DOES COME TO THE

116
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:00,832
HOUSE -- BY THE WAY, THE REASONS

117
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,267
DEMOCRATS ARE DOING THIS IS

118
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:04,970
BECAUSE THEY ARE A MINORITY.

119
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,405
>> Tucker: THEY ARE ALSO NOT

120
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:08,607
TALKING ABOUT IT, MOST OF THEM.

121
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:09,741
SOME FRINGE MEMBERS ARE.

122
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:12,778
>> WERE MEMBER THE 2006 EXAMPLE

123
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:15,180
WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH'S NUMBERS

124
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,181
WERE JUST TERRIBLE.

125
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,116
THE IRAQ WAR WAS GOING TERRIBLY.

126
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,751
THE DEMOCRATS WERE RUNNING TO

127
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,820
TRY TO WIN BACK CONGRESS IN

128
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,287
THOSE MIDTERMS.

129
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,588
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WERE TALKING

130
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:25,791
ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, BUT THE

131
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,958
PUBLIC REALLY DIDN'T WANT IT.

132
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,160
NANCY PELOSI CAME OUT ABOUT THIS

133
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,628
TIME OF THE YEAR IN 2006 AND

134
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:31,830
SAID IMPEACHMENT IS OFF THE

135
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,132
TABLE.

136
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:34,966
TODAY, 71% OF DEMOCRATS IN A

137
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,136
RECENT POLL SAID THEY WANT TO

138
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,171
SEE TRUMP IMPEACHED IF DEMOCRATS

139
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,172
TAKE THE HOUSE.

140
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:41,139
THE LEADERS KNOW THAT.

141
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,708
>> Tucker: THAT'S WHY IT'S SO

142
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,843
DISINGENUOUS TO DENY IT.

143
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:47,779
IF YOU ARE RUNNING THE

144
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,014
PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM, AND YOU

145
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,282
SHOULD BE, I WOULD SAY, WOULD

146
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:54,286
YOU ALLOW HIM TO SPEAK TO ANYONE

147
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:54,853
FROM ROBERT MUELLER'S

148
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:56,588
INVESTIGATION?

149
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:57,556
>> THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION, BUT

150
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:59,324
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT HE SHOULD

151
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:03,161
HAVE TAKEN THE DEAL TO GO SOME

152
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:03,729
TIME AGO AND SAT DOWN.

153
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,997
I WROTE A COLUMN MONTHS AGO THAT

154
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,699
SAID IT'S A GOOD DEAL IF THEY

155
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:10,769
STICK WITH THE FOUR CATEGORIES

156
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,871
THAT DOWD AND TY COBB NEGOTIATED

157
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:13,739
THAT DOWD AND TY COBB NEGOTIATE

158
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:14,139
NEGOTIATED.

159
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:14,873
COULD YOU PREPARE THE PRESIDENT

160
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:15,240
FOR THAT?

161
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,141
I THINK YOU COULD.

162
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:18,310
I THINK THAT WAS THE QUICKEST

163
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,944
WAY TO DEFUSE THIS.

164
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:21,012
THE QUESTION IS REALLY THE END

165
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:21,313
GAME.

166
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,615
IF YOU BASICALLY DEFY THE

167
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:25,183
SUBPOENA, I THINK THAT HE WILL

168
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:25,484
LOSE.

169
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:28,954
THE EXISTING CASE LAW FAVORS

170
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:31,223
MUELLER AND ONCE HE WINS IN THAT

171
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:33,992
PROCESS YOU GIVE HIM A COURT

172
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:35,293
ORDER WHERE YOU CAN NEGOTIATE

173
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,195
WITH HIM BUT HE'S IN A MUCH

174
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:37,763
STRONGER POSITION.

175
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:39,564
HE COULD DEMAND AND A COURT

176
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:41,099
COULD VERY WELL GO ALONG WITH

177
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,268
THE CONVENTIONAL GRAND JURY

178
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:44,903
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE END

179
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:47,105
GAME THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO LAY

180
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:47,372
OUT?

181
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,741
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THE

182
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:50,642
PRESIDENT -- PEOPLE KEEP ON

183
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:51,676
SAYING HE'S GOING TO BE A

184
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,612
DISASTER, HE'S GOING TO BURST

185
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:54,146
INTO FLAMES.

186
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:55,347
I DISAGREE WITH THAT.

187
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:56,415
I'VE DONE A LOT OF DEPOSITIONS

188
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:57,282
THAT WERE MORE COMPLICATED THAN

189
