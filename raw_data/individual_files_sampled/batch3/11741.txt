Afghan citizens have submitted more than a million statements to the International Criminal Court alleging they were victims of war crimes the court began collecting testimonies in November last year the statements described accounts of alleged atrocities perpetrated not only by the Taliban or by Islamic state but also by the Afghan army and by American military forces stationed there some of the testimonies were submitted on behalf of a number of people so the actual number of crimes could be higher we spoke to Abdul Ahad 52 members of whose family were killed in the conflict in fact there are different kind of war crimes happen in Afghanistan in the past 16 17 years american-born villages the bomb wedding parties that's one kind of crime another type of crime Afghan security forces in ters villages and without any reason do you kill people without you know identifying whether they are armed they're against the government or they're just simple people living in the village at the end of last year the International Criminal Court released a statement alleging American our armed forces as well as a CIA committed war crimes in Afghanistan in the early 2000s jennipher Breeden who's an attorney specializing in foreign policy believes that it's going to be very difficult to bring about justice there could be many more claims that come out these claims have come out against three different factions the Taliban and their Haqqani network in Afghanistan also against Afghani government forces or Afghanistan military there and as well as US military and US military personnel in Afghanistan's now on the domestic side the United States military code has a very strict and stringent a very long list of laws that military personnel men and women have to be subject to and they have to follow but in terms of international crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court then no then the u.s. cannot be held under the jurisdiction because the United States is not a signatory to the Rome Statute to which created the international criminal so in that case it would be less likely that they'd be brought to justice by member states are those that are aligned or fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC
