say guess who's coming home for dinner yes it's Joshua boil that sometimes alleged hostage that sometimes alleged sexual assault err and that sometimes honored guests of Justin Trudeau yet as the bizarre boil saga continues to unfold why is it that there's still so much about this soap opera that doesn't make any sense and why does the mainstream media continue to veer away from asking the truly hard questions you may remember Joshua Boyle he's that goofball who thought it was a groovy idea to take his pregnant American wife on a backpacking trip through Afghanistan some six years ago I think it would have been safer to scale Mount Everest during a blizzard but what is a homebody like me know about the international jet set anyway the inevitable happened as the boils went tiptoeing through the tulips and one of the most upside-down gunned up regimes in the entire world namely Joshua and Kaitlin met up with some really bad G Hattie's who allegedly kidnapped them well those daddy's really weren't all that bad mind you I mean the couple were allowed regular conjugal visits producing three children as a result it should be noted that Caitlyn's original baby perished either via abortion or miscarriage depending on whom you believed but eventually the Boyle clan was rescued and whisked back home to Canada and they all lived happily ever after right now quite for this fine young man was arrested back on New Year's Day in Ottawa and charged with good golly 19 criminal acts including sexual assault unlawful confinement an assault with a weapon these charges covered off a wide range of offenses committed during October to December of last year right after his return to Canada hey that's gratitude for you eh but after going to the crowbar Motel for a spell he now out on bail thanks to a $10,000 bond posted by his beleaguered parents and what's more Ottawa citizens crime reporter Gary Dimmick reports that Joshua Boyles wife wants a divorce do you blame her in any event so many questions beg to be answered here but I'll have to whittle it down to a list of the top four number one how in blue hell can Joshua Boyle afford Lawrence Green spawn as his attorney mr. greens one is a top-shelf legal eagle who's paying those bills number two why doesn't the media have more questions about the alleged kidnapping and what brought Joshua Boyle to Afghanistan in the first place number three did Prime Minister Justin Trudeau know if the police were investigating Joshua Boyle for his 19 charges when he personally met with the family back in November and finally number four am I the only one who is rattled by the fact that Joshua's previous wife happens to be the odious Pro al Qaeda is an Abe Cotter yes none other than the sister of all mark Carter yeah that poor kid who was given a multi million dollar payout of your money and a public apology by your prime minister last summer then again little Omar did suffer years of incarceration at Gitmo and all the kid did was murder an American servicemen and partially blind another in any event so many questions so few answers look I don't claim to know what's really going on when it comes to the whole Boyle brouhaha but it just gets evermore confusing with each passing month but I do know this in the here and now this case stinks worse than rancid tuna left out in the Kandahar Sun and how very odd how very sad that someone like a Joshua Boyle is a free man today while someone like Tommy Robinson rots behind bars what's wrong with this picture for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
