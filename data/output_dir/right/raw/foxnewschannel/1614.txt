1
00:00:01,137 --> 00:00:02,705
PLAY HIM BECAUSE IF YOU DO

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:04,340
THAT, WE'LL HAVE A WAR AND YOU

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,743
ARE GOING TO LOSE IT.

4
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:11,581
>> Sandra: CHRIS WALLACE IS THE

5
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,850
ANCHOR OF "FOX NEWS SUNDAY".

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,117
GOOD AFTERNOON FROM WINDSOR.

7
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:18,020
>> I HAVE TO SAY YOU LOOK

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,789
SMASHING, I GUESS IS WHAT THE

9
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:20,957
BRITISH WOULD SAY.

10
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:22,758
THAT'S QUITE A BACK DROP BEHIND

11
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:23,793
YOU, SANDRA.

12
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:24,994
>> Sandra: THAT'S QUITE PROPER

13
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:25,661
OF YOU.

14
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:26,596
YOU ARE ALWAYS A GENTLEMAN,

15
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:26,896
CHRIS.

16
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,931
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

17
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:30,099
MEANWHILE THERE IS SO MUCH

18
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,734
GOING ON BACK AT HOME AND BIG

19
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:33,369
DECISIONS THE MAKE WHEN IT

20
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:35,238
COMES TO NORTH KOREA AND

21
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:36,873
STRATEGIZING WHAT TO DO NEXT.

22
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,774
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU

23
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:40,176
JUST HEARD FROM LINDSEY GRAHAM

24
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:40,643
THERE?

25
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:42,278
>> WELL LOOK, A LOT OF THIS IS

26
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:44,380
PLAYED OUT ACTUALLY ON "FOX

27
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,081
NEWS SUNDAY".

28
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:47,183
A FEW WEEKS AGO JOHN BOLTON IN

29
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:49,318
HIS FIRST INTERVIEW AS NATIONAL

30
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:52,054
SECURITY ADVISOR CAME ON "FOX

31
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:54,423
NEWS SUNDAY" AND SAID DRAMATIC

32
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:56,559
TERMS AS TO WHAT THE NORTH

33
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,027
KOREANS WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP

34
00:00:58,027 --> 00:00:59,929
IN GETTING RELIEF FROM ECONOMIC

35
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,330
SANCTIONS.

36
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,834
HE TALKED ABOUT THE LIBYAN

37
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:11,040
MODEL FROM 2003-2004 AND THAT'S

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,744
WHEN LIBYAN DICTATOR GADHAFI

39
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:16,746
GAVE UP LIBYA'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM

40
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,247
FOR RELAXATION IN SANCTIONS.

41
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:22,218
THE NORTH KOREANS READ THAT

42
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:22,685
DIFFERENTLY.

43
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:25,021
LATER ON IN 2011, 2012, THE

44
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,656
U.S. AND THE ALLIES MOVED

45
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:28,824
AGAINST GADHAFI AND HE ENDED UP

46
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:30,860
BEING KILLED BY REBELS IN THE

47
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,193
STREET.

48
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:32,595
SO IF YOU'RE KIM JONG-UN, THAT

49
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:34,163
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A VERY GOOD

50
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:35,331
MODEL AND THEY SAID LOOK, THE

51
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:37,199
LAST THING WE WANT IS THE

52
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,501
LIBYAN MODEL WHICH IS WHY THE

53
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:39,568
PRESIDENT WAS AT PAINS

54
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:41,404
YESTERDAY TO SAY WE AREN'T

55
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:43,306
TALKING ABOUT THE LIBYAN MODEL

56
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:44,941
WITH JOHN BOLTON STANDING IN

57
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,443
HIS SHADOW IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

58
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:48,711
SO BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO HAVE

59
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:49,278
THIS MEETING TODAY.

60
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:51,781
THEY HAVE TO GET ON THE RIGHT

61
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,816
PAGE.

62
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:54,750
THREE SENDING MIXED SIGNALS

63
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,619
PARTICULARLY SECRETARY OF STATE

64
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,721
POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON AND MAKE

65
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,423
SURE THEY'RE SENDING EXACTLY

66
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,725
THE RIGHT SIGNAL TO KIM JONG-UN.

67
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:05,061
AS FAR AS WHAT LINDSEY GRAHAM

68
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:07,163
SAID IT IS WHAT MIKE MULLEN

69
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:09,065
SAID ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY" LAST

70
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:10,265
WEEK WHICH IS THIS IS VERY

71
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:12,134
HOPEFUL THAT YOU HAVE THE

72
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:12,468
SUMMIT.

73
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:15,471
IF IT FALLS APART, THERE IS NOT

74
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:17,340
MUCH MORE ROOM FOR DIPLOMACY

75
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,941
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ISN'T GOING

76
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:20,843
TO FEEL WITHOUT ROOM FOR

77
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:23,379
DIPLOMACY HE HAS TO ENGAGE IN

78
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,814
MILITARY STRIKE AGAINST NORTH

79
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:26,682
KOREA TO STOP ITS NUCLEAR

80
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:27,016
PROGRAM.

81
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:31,053
SO THAT'S THE HIGH RISK AND

82
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,221
HIGH REWARD OF THIS KIM/TRUMP

83
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,389
SUMMIT.

84
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,057
>> Sandra: WHAT EXTENT IS

85
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:37,226
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOWING THAT HE

86
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,328
IS WILLING TO GO TO MAKE THIS

87
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:40,730
SUMMIT HAPPEN, CHRIS?

88
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,267
>> WELL, HE HAS ACCEPTED THE

89
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:48,070
DEAL AND CLEARLY HE SEEMS

90
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,471
INTERESTED.

91
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:51,640
I WAS GOING TO SAY ENAMORED OF

92
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,275
THE IDEA HE COULD PULL OFF A

93
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:54,910
DEAL THAT EVERYBODY IN THE

94
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,345
WORLD THOUGHT WAS UNTHINKABLE A

95
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:57,046
COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

96
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,382
THE IDEA THAT KIM WOULD GIVE UP

97
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:02,018
HIS ENTIRE NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN

98
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,419
RETURN FOR RELIEF IN SANCTIONS

99
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,587
AND THE PRESIDENT ALSO

100
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:06,455
YESTERDAY SORT OF UPPED THE

101
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:07,623
ANTE IN TERMS OF WHAT HE WOULD

102
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:09,959
BE WILLING TO GIVE KIM AND

103
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:10,926
BASICALLY SAID SECURITY

104
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,094
GUARANTEE THAT THE U.S. WOULD

105
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:15,664
NEVER OR AT LEAST AS LONG AS

106
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:18,167
KIM MINDED HIS MANNERS, KEPT TO

107
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,302
HIS WORD, THAT HE WOULD NEVER

108
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,405
MOVE AGAINST THE KIM REGIME.

109
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:25,474
SO HE IS WILLING TO DO A LOT

110
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:27,376
BUT HAVING SEEN HOW KIM AND HIS

111
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,778
FATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER WENT

112
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:31,113
BACK ON THEIR WORD IN PREVIOUS

113
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:33,449
CASES, CLEARLY HE WANTS CLEAR

114
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,084
ASSURANCES AND PROOF AND A WAY

115
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:38,154
TO VERIFY THAT KIM IS GIVING UP

116
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,555
HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND HIS

117
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:40,956
MISSILE PROGRAM BEFORE HE IS

118
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:43,426
WILLING TO MAKE ANY PROMISES OF

119
00:03:43,426 --> 00:03:46,362
SECURITY OR ECONOMIC RELIEF.

120
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,530
>> Sandra: WE ALWAYS LOOK

121
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,432
FORWARD TO YOU MAKING NEWS ON

122
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,599

WEEKENDS.

124
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:54,437
WHO DO YOU HAVE AS A GUEST THIS

125
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:54,770
WEEKEND?

126
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,474
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM, I HAVE TO

127
00:03:58,474 --> 00:03:59,308
SAY MY COLLEAGUE MARTHA

128
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,043
MACCALLUM GOT A LOT OUT OF THE

129
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:03,846
SENATOR.

130
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:05,514
HE IS ALWAYS INTERESTING AND

131
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:07,817
INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS

132
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:09,452
TO SAY ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

133
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,854
PROMISE IN THE OVAL OFFICE TO

134
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:14,223
SAY IF KIM MAKES A DEAL NORTH

135
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:16,091
KOREA WILL BE A PROSPEROUS

136
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:16,425
COUNTRY.

137
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,160
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS TO GRAHAM

138
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,894
ARE WE GIVING UP TOO MUCH IN

139
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:20,963
RETURN FOR WHAT NORTH KOREA

140
00:04:20,963 --> 00:04:22,231
MIGHT PROMISE TO DO?

141
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:27,536
>> Sandra: MARK YOUR CALENDARS.

142
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:29,305
FIRST WATCH SHEP, AINSLEY AND I

143
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:31,073

>> I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU.

148
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:42,051
ARE YOU GOING TO WEAR ONE OF

149
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:43,452
THOSE SILLY FASCINATEOR HATS

150
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:47,423

153
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,194
SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK I SHOULD.

00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:54,063
WE'LL SEE WHAT SHEP IS WEARING,

155
