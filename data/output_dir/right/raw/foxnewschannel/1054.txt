1
00:00:00,894 --> 00:00:01,528
>> Sean: CEASE AND DESIST?

2
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:02,562
THE IDEA CAME FROM ME.

3
00:00:02,562 --> 00:00:03,730
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW STUPID

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,064
SOME OF YOU PEOPLE ARE THAT

5
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:05,832
SUPPOSEDLY WORK IN THE

6
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:06,366
BUSINESS.

THE CASE AGAINST THE

ANTI-TRUMP CONSPIRACY."

12
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:16,109
JUDGE PIRRO IN THE HOUSE.

13
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,410
ALSO WITH US THE NUMBER ONE

14
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,179

WITH US.

17
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:30,423
OKAY.

18
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:31,824
I SAD BAD IDEA, THIS WON'T

19
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:35,261
WORK OUT WELL FOR YOU.

20
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:37,430
THEY ARE MORE MAD -- HOW DID

21
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,298
THEY NOT GET IT?

22
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:40,900
>> THEY DON'T GET IT BECAUSE

23
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,537
THEY ARE SO CONSUMED WITH THE

24
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:47,307
TRUMP ARRANGEMENT SYNDROME IT

25
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:48,508
DOESN'T MATTER WHO DOES RIGHT

26
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:48,875
OR WRONG.

27
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,376
IF YOU SAY ANYTHING THEY WILL

28
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:51,611
HATE YOU FOR IT.

29
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:52,879
WHEREAS ONE SAID, I WROTE IT

30
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,347
DOWN, WHERE DID THE IDEA COME

31
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:54,781
FROM?

32
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:55,715
>> Sean: FROM ME.

33
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:56,049
>> NO.

34
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:57,150
THE IDEA CAME FROM HILLARY

35
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,550
CLINTON.

36
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,152
IT WAS A JOKE ON WHAT HILLARY

37
00:00:59,152 --> 00:00:59,752
CLINTON DID.

38
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:00,253
C'MON!

39
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:01,554
>> Sean: SHE DID THESE

40
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:02,055
THINGS.

41
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:03,723
>> SHE GOT A WARNING -- LOOK,

42
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:04,456
YOU BETTER --

43
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,925
>> Sean: A WARNING?

44
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:07,393
SHE BROKE THE LAW.

45
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:09,429
>> LEAK E-MAIL AND DESTROY THE

46
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:11,231
EVIDENCE IN CASE WE COME FOR

47
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:12,632
YOU BUT WE'RE NOT COMING FROM

48
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:13,066
YOU.

49
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,801
>> FOR THE FOLKS TO TAKE YOU

50
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:15,435
SERIOUSLY SUGGESTS ONE

51
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:16,069
THING --

52
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:19,272
>> Sean: THAT SOUNDS BAD.

53
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:21,975
THAT MOMENT WAS SARCASTIC AS

54
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:22,342
HELL.

55
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:22,775
>> ABSOLUTELY.

56
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,244
AS A MATTER OF FACT I HEARD

57
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:24,711
YOU LIVE.

58
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,279
IT WAS A FUNNY BIT.

59
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:27,580
I WAS TERRIFIC.

60
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,883
BUT FOR THOSE FOLKS TO TRY TO

61
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,986
PRETEND IN FRONT OF THEIR

62
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:34,754
AUDIENCES WHO COME TO THEM FOR

63
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:36,556
A SEMBLANCE ON PERSPECTIVE ON

64
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,392
THE WORLD AND TAKE THEM

65
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:42,328
SERIOUSLY -- LET ME EXPLAINS

66
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,297
WHAMMED HERE.

67
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:45,698
I DON'T KNOW A NAME OF THE

68
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:46,866
SINGLE PERSON YOU PUT IN FRONT

69
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:47,800
OF US IN THE AUDIENCE.

70
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,968
>> Sean: I DON'T EITHER.

71
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:51,671
>> I'LL BET THAT THE MSNBC

72
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:52,639
AUDIENCE DOESN'T KNOW THE NAME

73
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:53,239
OF THOSE FOLKS.

74
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,476
THE REASON THEY ARE MENTIONED

75
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:57,877
THE NAME AND ANY CONTEXT AT

76
00:01:57,877 --> 00:01:59,879
ALL THEY ARE TRYING TO AFFIX

77
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,880
THEMSELVES TO SOME PART OF

78
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,447
THE --

79
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:02,448
>> Sean: WAIT.

80
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:03,049
>>  -- STATUS.

81
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,450
>> Sean: HOW DID I BECOME

82
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:04,851
CLICK BAIT?

83
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:11,357
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

84
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:12,859
>> THE WHOLE IDEA TO SAY WOMEN

85
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:16,863
WHO SUPPORT TRUMP ARE NUMB OR

86
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:17,497
DEAD INSIDE.

87
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,831
HOW DARE YOU CRASH THE WOMEN

88
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:21,801
OF THIS COUNTRY AS DEAD INSIDE

89
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,269
BECAUSE WE DON'T AGREE WITH

90
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,771
YOU.

91
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:26,339
>> Sean: ANYBODY WATCHING

92
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:27,140
KNOWS THAT'S FALSE.

93
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,508
YOU ARE VERY ALIVE.

94
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:30,276
WHAT A HISTORIC WEEK WE ARE

95
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,110
HEADING INTO.

96
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,878
>> YOU BET.

97
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:33,479
>> THERE IS NO RISK TO THE

98
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,247
PRESIDENT HERE.

99
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:38,117
HE MANAGED THE EXPECTATIONS.

100
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,585
MAYBE IT NEEDS FIVE MEETINGS

101
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,953
OR MAYBE WE END THE KOREAN

102
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:41,354
WAR.

103
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:42,989
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS

104
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,825
COMMUNICATED THIS WEEK IN HIS

105
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,093
BODY LANGUAGE AND HIS WORDS

106
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,528
AND HIS ACTIONS JUST HOW ON

107
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:50,630
TAXPAYER OF HIS GAME HE IS.

108
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,931
THIS IS A PRESIDENT NOT ONLY

109
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:55,201
HAD THE MOST HISTORIC LIST OF

110
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,770
ACHIEVEMENTS OF ANY PRESIDENT

111
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,507
SINCE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT IN A

112
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:02,942
YEAR AND A HALF BUT HE HAS

113
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:04,444
GROWN IMMENSELY AS A LEADER.

114
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:06,245
THIS IS A MAN WHO IS A NATURAL

115
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:07,013
BORN LEADER.

116
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:08,381
HE HAS LED BUSINESS.

117
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,216
HE HAS LED NOW THE COUNTRY.

118
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:11,284
>> Sean: I THINK HE HAS

119
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,052
FIGURED IT OUT.

120
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:14,420
>> THIS MAN FOUND HIS VOICE.

121
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,656
HE KNOWS, HE HAS KNOWN WHO HE

122
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:17,290
IS THROUGHOUT.

123
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,925
AND NOW HE KNOWS THE JOB.

124
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:23,296
THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE RYAN,

125
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:24,397
McCONNELL, SCHUMER, PELOSI,

126
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:25,598
RUN FOR COVER BECAUSE HE IS

127
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:27,600
GOING TO HAVE HIS WAY.

128
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,334
MARK MY WORDS.

129
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,369
>> Sean: IT'S SAD THAT THE

130
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:29,802
REPUBLICANS.

131
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:30,703
THIS IS THEIR BEST

132
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,104
OPPORTUNITY.

133
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:32,538
ALL THEY HAVE TO SAY THIS IS A

134
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:33,406
GREAT AGENDA.

135
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:34,474
LOOK AT THE ECONOMY AND

136
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:34,941
FOREIGN POLICY.

137
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,442
EVERYTHING IS GETTING BETTER.

138
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:37,844
THEY SHOULD BE HAPPY AND WANT

139
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:40,179
TO BE PART OF IT.

140
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,347
>> PAUL RYAN CAN'T STAND THE

141
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,083
FACT THAT HE DOESN'T AMOUNT TO

142
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,485
SHOE LACES ON THE

143
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:46,152
PRESIDENT'S --

144
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:48,554
>> Sean: YOU SCARED ME

145
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:52,191
THERE.

146
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,159
SHHH-SHOE LACES.

147
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,561
>> I'M USED TO GOING OTHER

148
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:55,995
PLACES.

149
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,230
>> Sean: I HEARD IT, LOU.

150
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,831
LET ME ASK YOU, NOT ONLY THE

151
00:03:58,831 --> 00:03:59,699
NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT.

152
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,100
NOW WE HAVE AN I.G. REPORT.

153
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,535
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE

154
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,703
TIMING OF THE RELEASE.

155
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:05,204
18 MONTHS AND WE ARE GOING TO

156
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,506
RELEASE IT TWO DAYS AFTER THE

157
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:06,839
SUMMIT.

158
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:12,211
THE LEAKS I HEAR.

159
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:12,912
INSUBORDINATE WITH JAMES

160
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:13,246
COMEY.

161
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:14,981
ARE THEY GOING TO TELL US THE

162
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:15,415
TRUTH?

163
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,216
HILLARY BROKE THE LAW.

164
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,118
HILLARY COMMITTED FELONIES AND

165
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:19,918
OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE.

166
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,255
AND COMEY AND OTHERS PUT THE

167
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:23,623
FIX IN AND WROTE THE

168
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:24,457
EXONERATION MONTHS BEFORE THEY

169
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,258
DID THE INVESTIGATION.

170
00:04:25,258 --> 00:04:26,125
>> HERE IS THE TRUTH.

171
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,660
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS NO

172
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,194
POWER.

173
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:29,429
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH YOU WANT

174
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:30,630
TO SAY THANKS FOR THE REPORT.

175
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,098
BUT WHERE IS THE BEEF?

176
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:34,567
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO

177
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,134
INDICT.

178
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:36,302
SHOULD JAMES COMEY BE

179
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:36,669
INDICTED?

180
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,204
THE QUESTION BASED ON WHAT I

181
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:39,906
HAVE HEARD IS YES.

182
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,240
>> Sean: McCAIN GOT A

183
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,308
CRIMINAL REFERRAL AFTER THE

184
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:43,209
I.G. REPORT.

185
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,212
WE'LL DO THIS WITH SARAH AND

186
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:47,480
GREGG NEXT.

187
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,414
>> COMEY, THEY HAVE TO.

188
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,751
>> Sean: I THINK COMEY,

189
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:52,885
STROZK, McCABE ALL IN DEEP

190
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:53,352
TROUBLE.

191
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:55,154
>> WILL THEY TURN AGAINST

192
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:55,822
