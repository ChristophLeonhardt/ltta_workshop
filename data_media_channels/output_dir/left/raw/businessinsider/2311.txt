00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,560
bubbles bursting throughout history<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,819
to say what lessons can we learn from

13
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:28,310
history and it's a pretty strong lesson

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,589
from the 1930s<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you the government</font>

15
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,900
does need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reflate the economy when</font>

you go the quiddity crisis of the kind

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've had when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you win the public</font>

18
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,780
panic Sandra trenches and stop spending

19
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,280
that the government has to take up the

20
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">slack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you know I think it's right</font>

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,910
and it's good that the governments of

22
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,890
the world have learned that one lesson

23
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,130
from the 1930s the trouble is as we also

24
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,240
observed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the 1970s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keynesianism</font>

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,370
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess that reflationary policy was</font>

26
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,280
was known as you know actually ran out

27
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,070
of steam<font color="#CCCCCC"> that governments actually</font>

28
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,150
aren't very good at spending money

29
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,960
effectively and that in the end we had

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,740
unsustainable large states that were

31
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,869
sucking all the entrepreneurial capital

32
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:14,060
out of the system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have to at</font>

33
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,909
some point reverse track and the thing

34
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,770
is America already had a serious fiscal

35
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,499
problem before we got into this crisis

36
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,020
because you've got unfunded social

37
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,420
security and medical which is obligation

38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">aren't even doubted you know we</font>

apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> fannie and freddie's bailout</font>

40
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:31,670
is not counted<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some of the</font>

41
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,959
deficit numbers that we're seeing as

42
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,719
well there were real questions out in

43
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,060
the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> economy when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up see china has</font>

44
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">been buying a lot of american securities</font>

45
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,219
and there's growing worries that maybe

46
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,569
you know that actually they'll say we

47
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,659
will lose confidence in American debt

48
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,289
paper and maybe even the ratings

49
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">agencies were considered downgrading</font>

50
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,759
American debt which would have sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,069
catastrophic implications in the capital

52
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:59,899
markets so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reason to</font>

53
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,159
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's why the</font>

54
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,840
government is under pressure rightly to

55
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,789
actually come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a plan I can't see</font>

56
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,859
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening before the midterm</font>

57
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">elections because the pressure is going</font>

58
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:08,860
to be on

59
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,650
on the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend and that's</font>

60
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,230
about it and create jobs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so as soon</font>

61
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">as we see the midterms out of the way I</font>

62
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's going to be a huge crisis</font>

63
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about spending America and how to</font>

64
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,260
actually bring this this sort of rising

65
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,270
debt problem under control so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend</font>

66
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,830
through the midterms then we have this

67
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,540
debate if the economist's were running

68
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,180
the country what would we do well i

69
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,130
think you know we would continue

70
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,410
stimulating at the moment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we</font>

71
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,970
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some very tough proposals on</font>

72
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,780
privatizing a lot of what's going on the

73
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,709
state getting rid of a lot of

74
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,270
entitlements particularly around social

75
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,100
security will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be raising</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the retirement</font>

76
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,459
age very aggressively for people who are

77
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,989
approaching retirement now rather than

78
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,459
people 20 years in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future which</font>

79
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,260
tends to be what politicians<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposing</font>

80
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,110
but you have to get very aggressive with

81
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,459
a number of the promises<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been</font>

82
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,080
made which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just not sustainable in</font>

83
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,790
this in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world we're now entering</font>

84
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,440
raise taxes well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we we we would</font>

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually look more introducing va te</font>

86
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,630
here and actually moving towards more of

87
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,989
a flat tanks getting rid of some of the

88
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,070
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that you can just</font>

89
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply tax the rich to solve this</font>

90
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,280
problem is ludicrous it's the thing that

91
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,900
politicians often save it was the

92
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,250
easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say but it's not going</font>

93
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,600
to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems of America's</font>

94
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,519
face and anyone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> travels in Europe</font>

95
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,019
America to travel europe very familiar

96
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the vit what is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DAT and what's</font>

97
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,310
the opposition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if it's such a good</font>

98
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,049
idea well i'm adding the big it's an

99
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,000
it's just attacks on the the value each

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,799
stage that value is added to the

101
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,049
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are being made you take a</font>

102
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,519
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tax out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the system it's very</font>

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,680
easy to collect because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's on goods</font>

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,920
and services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are bought so there's</font>

105
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,959
a key point at which money is collected

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,060
that you can actually tax the problem

107
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,280
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that is it's regressive that</font>

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,470
poor<font color="#E5E5E5"> people it hits poorer people harder</font>

109
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,840
than richer people and so that makes it

110
00:03:55,840 --> 00:00:00,000
quite a hard sell politically
