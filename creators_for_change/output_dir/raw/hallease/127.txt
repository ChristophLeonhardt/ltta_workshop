talking about accountability and why you

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,270
shouldn't necessarily say and proclaim

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,370
out loud what your goals are because it

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,079

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,079
really pursue just a few so I realized

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,629
myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmmm ok if you don't have someone</font>
