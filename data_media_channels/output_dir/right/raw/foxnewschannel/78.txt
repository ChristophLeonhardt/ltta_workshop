1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,988
MADE US LAUGH THAT WAS CUTE.

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:06,123
BRIAN: BIG STATE, BIG FUN, JESS

3
00:00:06,124 --> 00:00:08,425
EWATERS IS A BIG STAR.

4
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:09,893
STEVE: THAT WAS HOUSTON OF THE

5
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:10,728
COUPLE HUNDRED MILES TO THE

6
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:13,230
NORTH IN DALLAS, FORD STADIUM,

7
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,232
BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS OF SMU WHERE

8
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,201
ONE OF THE DOOCY CHILDREN DID

9
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:19,503
ONCE UPON A TIME DID ATTEND,

10
00:00:19,504 --> 00:00:22,172
JESSE WATTERS.

11
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:24,908
JESSE, PEOPLE OF TEXAS ARE

12
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:26,410
EXCITED ABOUT THE SENATE RACE,

13
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:26,810
AREN'T THEY?

14
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:28,879
>> IT'S A HOT RACE.

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,047
TRUMP IS UP ABOUT SEVEN.

16
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:31,582
I THINK BETO IS GOING DOWN.

17
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,950
HE CHANGED HIS NAME.

18
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:34,418
WHO DOES THAT.

19
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:35,886
AINSLEY, YOU NEVER CHANGED YOUR

20
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:36,186
NAME.

21
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:37,588
I NEVER CHANGED MY NAME.

22
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,690
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS

23
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:39,990
ABOUT.

24
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:41,558
IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR HIM.

25
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,961
LIKE THE REPORTER JUST SAID,

26
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,230
LIKE BIEBER MANIA.

27
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:47,398
PEOPLE PITCHING TENTS.

28
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,633
IT IS ELECTRIC.

29
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,502
"THE FIVE" IS DOWN HERE TO FEEL

30
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:53,470
THE PULSE OF THE SITUATION DOWN

31
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:53,771
HERE.

32
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:56,173
JUAN MIGHT HANG OUT WITH BETO.

33
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:58,042
WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THAT HE

34
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:00,010
HAS KIND OF GOT BETO FEVER.

35
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:01,712
IT IS GOING TO BE A FUN TIME

36
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:02,646
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE DOWN

37
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,982
HERE AT SMU TAKING QUESTIONS

38
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:05,983
FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS.

39
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,252
I'M NERVOUS BECAUSE USUALLY I'M

40
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:09,253
ASKING THE QUESTIONS.

41
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:10,587
SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE TURNING

42
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:11,822
THE TABLE ON US.

43
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,391
WE WENT TO A BARBECUE JOINT LAST

44
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:14,692
NIGHT.

45
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:16,493
I THINK GREG IS STILL ASLEEP.

46
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,662
HE HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH SWEET

47
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:19,063
TEA.

48
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:20,764
BUT WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF FUN

49
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:21,799
DOWN HERE.

50
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,433
STEVE: YEAH.

51
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,201
BRIAN: JESSE, WHEN YOU GO ON THE

52
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:25,936
ROAD WITH A CREW LIKE YOU GO ON

53
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:27,604
THE ROAD, EITHER BRINGS YOU

54
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:29,173
CLOSER OR BRINGS YOU APART.

55
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:30,874
I KNOW IT IS EARLY IN THE TRIP

56
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,143
BUT DO YOU SENSE AN ADDITIONAL

57
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:35,879
BONDING GOING ON AMONGST

61
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:42,419
>> I THINK DANA AND I HAVE

62
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,753
BONDED.

63
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:45,289
GREG AND I ARE KIND OF, YOU

64
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,523
KNOW, COULD BE BETTER.

65
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,925
LAST NIGHT WAS A LITTLE ROUGH.

66
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,794
HE LIKES TO HOG A LOT OF THE

67
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:51,161
ATTENTION.

68
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:52,930
BRIAN: GREG IS NOT NORMAL,

69
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:53,230
JESSE.

70
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:55,099
YOU ARE.

71
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,799
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

72
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,068
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH STEVE.

73
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:00,471
STEVE TRIES TO DOMINATE THE

74
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:00,938
SITUATION.

75
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:01,772
STEVE: RIGHT NOW.

00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,173
DARN IT.

>> LIKE RIGHT NOW.

78
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:06,443
BUT WE'RE ALL GETTING ALONG.

79
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:07,711
JUAN'S NOT HERE.

80
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,880
WE ALWAYS ASK, WHERE IS JUAN?

81
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,982
APPARENTLY JUAN'S COMING BUT WE

82
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:13,283
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM YET.

83
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:14,852
HOPEFULLY HE WILL BE HERE TODAY.

84
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:15,686
AINSLEY: HE DOESN'T WANT TO

85
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,254
TRAVEL WITH YOU.

86
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,690
