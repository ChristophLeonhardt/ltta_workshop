1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:04,070
Matt in one sentence what is the Pirates

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,950
dilemma so the Pirates dilemma is the

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,200
problem of what we do about digital

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,320
information and content spilling out

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,030
everywhere without anybody being able to

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,579
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so what have we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learned from</font>

7
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pirates thus far what's our biggest</font>

8
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:20,539
lesson I think the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,909
really learn from piracy is that often

10
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:24,859
it's a market signal often it's a sign

11
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,269
of market failure it's a sign that

12
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,730
something's not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite right in the</font>

13
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,829
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> marketplace that you</font>

14
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">operate in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if pirates are doing</font>

15
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that your consumers really get</font>

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,640
behind then fighting priority isn't

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,410
always the best strategy sometimes it's

18
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,730
better to look at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> those pirates are</font>

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,890
doing figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out where the value is in</font>

20
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,800
copy them so like you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> limewire for</font>

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,100
instance it's on one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in three computers</font>

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,390
what happens when society gets behind

23
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">pirates well the music industry is is</font>

24
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,170
the perfect example it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

25
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,579
canary in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coal mine for what's</font>

26
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,120
happening with with digital so if you

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at something like limewire if you</font>

28
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,989
can you imagine if someone like<font color="#CCCCCC"> sony</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BMG</font>

29
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">ori mi if they'd bought limewire in 1999</font>

30
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,810
or bought naps faster they would have

31
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iTunes is today Steve Jobs</font>

32
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,040
once said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to beat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pirates</font>

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,260
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compete with them and that's</font>

34
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,910
exactly what he did<font color="#CCCCCC"> with iTunes and</font>

35
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,590
that's why Apple was able to make this

36
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,420
really aggressive move into the music

37
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,630
business so in the music industry

38
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,650
competing with it and not fighting with

39
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,990
it proved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the best answer</font>

40
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,940
absolutely i mean if you look at where

41
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,610
digital's gone in terms of music all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

42
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,870
businesses that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing really well of</font>

43
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,370
the businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> that worked out new ways</font>

44
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,530
to engage with audiences and to find

45
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,750
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> into and to connect with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

46
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,670
and earn money in other places rather

47
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,280
than just selling them plastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> discs so</font>

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,890
other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> itunes and apples are Apple</font>

49
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,630
what has been the most effective

50
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,210
corporate response so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most effective</font>

51
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,560
corporate response and you see this

52
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,510
everywhere is people looking at what

53
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,490
Pirates do looking at the value and then

54
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,110
and then doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it themselves there's</font>

55
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,990
examples everywhere from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nike looking at</font>

56
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,790
sneaker pirates and people copying their

57
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,770
designs and then looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool</font>

58
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,060
things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those designs and coming out</font>

59
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,280
with better designs there's examples in

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,100
the pharmaceutical business of big big

61
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,230
companies watching where people are

62
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,270
pirating their drugs

63
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,160
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into those markets and</font>

64
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,620
establishing new markets and giving away

65
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,450
the drug sometimes sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

66
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,390
lower prices often<font color="#E5E5E5"> pirates are fighting</font>

67
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,980
new pioneers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of finding new</font>

68
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,260
markets and new things that people kind

69
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the marketplace can't</font>

70
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,970
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> see now you offered your book for</font>

71
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">free on your website you also have it on</font>

72
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,920
amazon has offering it for free open up

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,340
more opportunity for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you absolutely so I</font>

74
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,410
offer it under a pay-what-you-want model

75
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,000
on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> website about ten to fifteen</font>

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,640
percent of the people pay five dollars

77
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,130
or more for a copy of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> book it</font>

78
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,860
didn't cannibalize digital book sales

79
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,110
physical book sales at all it actually

80
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,300
caused a spike in physical book sales

81
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,980
because of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> press we got mm-hmm</font>

82
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,800
and in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunities in terms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of speaking at</font>

84
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,140
conferences or consulting or all the

85
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,240
opportunities that business books are

86
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,800
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about they're really giant</font>

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,180
business cards a lot of business book

88
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,700
authors myself included making<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

89
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">more money from all the things they do</font>

90
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,020
other than selling books so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

91
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the free where is the answer</font>

92
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,800
further our entrepreneur or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> artist</font>

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,630
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting started I don't</font>

94
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,130
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the right answer for everybody</font>

95
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,990
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the music industry again</font>

96
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,000
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't one business model that fits</font>

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,370
every single artist Justin Timberlake

98
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,830
has 150 revenue streams now that works

99
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,150
for him it might not work for another

100
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,250
band on the same label as him let alone

101
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,380
a different label the problem we're

102
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,300
dealing with online with digital is is

103
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a problem of complexity and us</font>

104
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">not understanding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you make all these</font>

105
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,900
new smaller revenue streams work

106
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,970
together rather than one big<font color="#E5E5E5"> revenue</font>

107
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,160
stream which may be sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case in</font>

108
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,100
the industry you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we're</font>

109
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,750
starting to get it but the answer is

110
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this route is really about you and</font>

111
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,620
what you do where your customers are and

112
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,820
how you can create a really unique

113
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,800
business model so one last question in

114
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,540
terms of films how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

115
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,120
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the problem of privacy so</font>

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,580
it's definitely be compete with it right

117
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,040
so this this kind of two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

118
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,780
one is the box office which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

119
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">been stronger I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

120
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change until we invent a better way</font>

121
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go on a first date with someone spend</font>

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,980
two hours in the dark<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think holly was</font>

123
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,020
going to be fine in terms of the shift

124
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,240
from DVD to digital formats

125
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,530
think blu-ray or any other physical

126
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,060
format is going to be the answer because

127
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,120
customers have already moved on the

128
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,919
answer really for them i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is coming</font>

129
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,389
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's so many ways to</font>

130
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,639
pirate the film it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about giving</font>

131
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,580
consumers as many ways in fact more ways

132
00:04:39,580 --> 00:00:00,000
to get something legitimately
