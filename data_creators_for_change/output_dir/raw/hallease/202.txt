00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,360

5
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,030
started out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first HTC evo</font>

6
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,110
back end I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even know what year</font>

7
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,030
that was and then I upgraded it to the

8
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,200
little HTC evo the desire and now I

9
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,810
decided let's break away from HTC for a

10
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,850
hot minute and try something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else so i</font>

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,640
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 10 minutes to download all the</font>

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,680
apps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them being</font>

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,619

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">i also figured out how all these people</font>

25
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,140
on Instagram take pictures without it

26
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,300
being a<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect square and it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

27
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,660
app called no crop downloaded that

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,239
really quick and now my pictures can be

29
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,790
in sixteen by nine crazy awesome and I

30
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,900
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all i've downloaded so far</font>

31
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,030
i still am staying true to some of my

32
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,480
android love so i do have google maps on

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,799

36
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,860
heard that it's not so great so that's

37
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,170
why i downloaded

38
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google Maps because I'm not trying to</font>

39
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,730

40
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,270

41
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,480
me know and i will try them out one

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,819
thing that this iphone does not have

43
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,910
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really sad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that the</font>

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,670
android phones used to you or do is this

45
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,650
app called pocket it's an app that

46
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,540
basically stores all of your like

47
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,720
personal login information and things

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,050
like that without without like any type

49
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,090
of developer knowing what it is so it

50
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,860
does it through dropbox and like in

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,560
crypts all your logins through dropbox

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,239
and so it's like you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> your dropbox</font>

53
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,890
account it links<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that and every time</font>

54
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,440
you update it on your phone it links and

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,180
saves it and updates it to your dropbox

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,030
and i really miss that app because being

57
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,670
a freelancer there are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many things</font>

58
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,680
that I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign into like Adobe's</font>

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,640
Creative Cloud and like all the web

60
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,620
hosting<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have for the</font>

61
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,040
company and this and that and logins out

62
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,080
the wazoo and that thing was really good

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,739
on my android phone the developer has

64
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">not made one for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone but i'm sure</font>

65
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's an app that's similar to that</font>

66
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,890
basically just something that holds all

67
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,390
your private information without

68
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,430
actually holding all your private

69
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,298
information is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want so if anyone</font>

70
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,700
knows where to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I will be</font>

71
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,500
eternally grateful when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bought a case</font>

72
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,100
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> otter box case for it</font>

73
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,340
it's pretty snazzy<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it's not too thick</font>

74
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,850
it's the commuter one commute instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

75
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the not commuter one I don't know what</font>

76
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,919
it's called but it's like fatter didn't

77
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,539
want that one I think the main

78
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference between these two brands like</font>

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,910
Apple versus Android colliding all the

80
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,750
time I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the iphone is probably</font>

81
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,090
more popular because it's incredibly

82
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,060
simplistic and because of its operating

83
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,710
system you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get too much lag</font>

84
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,870
whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel like with androids at</font>

85
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,539
least in my experience which is roughly

86
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,660
five years of having android phones I

87
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,830
guess yeah like four years of having

88
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,610
android phones is that

89
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,469
at the more widgets you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and things</font>

90
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:11,939
like that running on your phone

91
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,710
constantly the slower it's going to be

92
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,340
and become so I mean I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

93
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,259
iphone will eventually start slowing

94
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,729
down and sucking or whatever but for now

95
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,000
it is a breath<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very fresh air</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I still</font>

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the HTC one though is a pretty</font>

97
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,419
nifty phone so it's really more about

98
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,889
preference I think than actual like I

99
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:39,270
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know technology so to say but I</font>

100
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,930
will see you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> tomorrow beta people</font>
