00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,141
>> Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND

2
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:11,209
WELCOME TO TUCKER CARLSON

3
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:11,543
TONIGHT.

4
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:13,311
IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING 24 HOURS

5
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:15,113
EVEN BY THE ACTION-PACKED

6
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:16,514
STANDARDS OF 2018, THERE HAS

7
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:17,715
BEEN LOTS OF DRAMA AND

8
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:18,550
WASHINGTON.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,020
AS YOU WELL KNOW, RUDY GIULIANI

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,022
REVEALED ON THE SHALE ON HANNITY

11
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:27,725
SHOW THAT PAYMENTS COHAN MADE TO

12
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:28,426
A STAR STORMY DANIELS, WHICH

13
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:32,130
SEEMED LIKE A MAJOR STORY AT THE

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,430
TIME.

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,865
BUT WITHIN HOURS IT WASN'T EVEN

16
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:36,968
THE BIGGEST STORY OF THE DAY.

17
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:37,669
NBC NEWS REPORTED THAT FEDERAL

18
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:40,204
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD WIRETAPPED

19
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:46,444
COHEN'S PHONE, IT AND RECORDED A

20
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:47,378
CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH THE

21
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:48,913
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

22
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:50,882
BUT THEN THAT STORY CHANGED.

23
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:52,383
THE NEW ACCOUNT REPORTS HE

24
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:53,384
SIMPLY RECORDED THE NUMBERS THAT

25
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:54,319
HE DIALED AND NOT THE CONTENT OF

26
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:55,553
THE CALLS MADE OF.

27
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:58,356
AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW, AT

28
00:00:58,356 --> 00:00:58,957
8:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME.

29
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:01,960
ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE IS

30
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,094
THAT NBC SCREWED UP, BUT THAT'S

31
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:04,762
PRETTY MUCH ALL WE CAN BE

32
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:06,798
CERTAIN OF.

33
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:08,433
IF NBC'S FIRST STORY WAS WRONG,

34
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:10,768
WHY DO WE ASSUME THE SECOND WAS

35
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:11,069
RIGHT?

36
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:12,537
WE DON'T KNOW THE TRUTH AND WE

37
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,539
HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING.

38
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,740
IN THE ABSENCE OF HONESTY FROM

39
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,675
OUR GOVERNMENT, WE ARE TOTALLY

40
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:18,776
DEPENDENT UPON LEAKS FOR OUR

41
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:20,979
NEWS AND MANY OF THOSE ARE

42
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,014
DISHONEST.

43
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,616
MICHAEL COHEN BY THE WAY STILL

44
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,584
DOESN'T KNOW WHY HIS OFFICE WAS

45
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,720
RATED WHY HIS PHONES AND EMAILS

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,488
WERE REPORTED TO THE GOVERNMENT.

47
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:32,690
NO ONE IN THE GOVERNMENT IS

48
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,658
REQUIRED TO TELL HIM NOR WILL

49
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,561
THEY TELL HIM.

50
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:40,498
HOW ARE WE, MEN ARRIVE AT YOUR

51
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:42,333
HOME AND SEES YOUR COMPUTERS AND

52
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,501
PHONES AT GUNPOINT BUT NEVER

53
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,372
DESCRIBE WHY THEY ARE DOING IT.

54
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:51,376
MICHAEL:        COHAN CERTAINLYS

55
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:51,409
MICHAEL:        COHAN CERTAINLYE

56
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:51,676
MICHAEL:        COHAN CERTAINLYS

57
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:51,709
MICHAEL:        COHAN CERTAINLYL

58
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:51,743
MICHAEL:        COHAN CERTAINLYK

59
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:52,477
MICHAEL:        COHAN CERTAINLYE

60
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:52,744
MICHAEL:        COHAN CERTAINLYA

61
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:53,945
SHADY CHARACTER BUT SHADINESS IS

62
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:54,979
NOT A CRY.

63
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,980
THE FBI CAN'T DESTROY YOUR LIFE

64
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,482
BECAUSE YOU TALK LIKE A

65
00:01:57,482 --> 00:02:00,718
CHARACTER FROM "THE SOPRANOS,"

66
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,121
THOSE AREN'T FELONIES.

67
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:03,921
BASIC NORMS WERE VIOLATED,

68
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:05,223
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE IS AN

69
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:08,493
ANCIENT AND VITAL CONCEPT, AND

70
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:08,925
SO IS PRIVACY.

71
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,328
LET'S HOPE THEY HAD A VERY GOOD

72
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:13,131
REASON FOR DOING IT.

73
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,866
THEY'VE BETTER HAVE GOOD

74
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:15,600
EVIDENCE THAT MICHAEL COHEN WAS

75
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,003
DOING SOMETHING AWFUL IN ORDER

76
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:19,604
TO JUSTIFY THIS.

77
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:21,806
IT TURNS OUT THAT ALL OF THIS

78
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:23,841
WAS ABOUT A FINANCIAL SEDIMENT

79
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:25,510
WITH SOME STAR WHICH IS BY THE

80
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,845
WAY A STORY THAT NOT A SINGLE

81
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:28,713
AMERICAN IS HONESTLY SHOCKED OR

82
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:30,782
THREATENED BY NO MATTER WHAT

83
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:31,749
ANDERSON COOPER TELLS YOU.

84
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,718
IF THAT IS ALL IT'S ABOUT THEN

85
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,920
WHAT WE ARE WATCHING IS A

86
00:02:35,920 --> 00:00:00,000
GROTESQUE VIOLATION OF CIVIL
