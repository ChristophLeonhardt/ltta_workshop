00:00:00,823 --> 00:00:00,823
bring your own phone.
That Matter

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:10,533
>> WE HAVE LAWS THAT ARE THE

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:14,070
WORST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AS

4
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:16,572
COMING IN, WITH THAT THAT BEING

5
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:21,144
SAID WE ARE DOWN OVER 40% ON

6
00:00:21,144 --> 00:00:21,744
BORDER CROSSINGS.

7
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:22,945
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT I

8
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:24,681
THINK NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN ABLE

9
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:24,981
TO DO.

10
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,182
>> Laura: THAT WAS

11
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:26,883
PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT

12
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:28,584
THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS

13
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:29,352
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T

14
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:33,756
OFTEN HEAR ABOUT, ILLEGAL

15
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:35,758
IMMIGRATION CRISIS THANKS TO

16
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:36,359
CHAIN MIGRATION.

17
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,560
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS RELEASED

18
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,961
FIGURES SHOWING THAT CHAIN

19
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,197
MIGRATION, CHECK THIS OUT, IS

20
00:00:41,197 --> 00:00:43,366
RESPONSIBLE FOR 7.8 MILLION

21
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,600
IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE COME TO THE

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,171
UNITED STATES IN THE LAST

23
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:48,571
DECADE.

24
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:49,605
THAT'S THE SIZE OF

25
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:50,039
NEW YORK CITY.

26
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,642
THE VAST MAJORITY OF ROUGHLY

27
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:53,743
10.8 MILLION IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE

28
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:56,746
COME HERE SINCE 2008.

29
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:58,748
CHAIN MIGRATION ALLOWS NEWLY

30
00:00:58,748 --> 00:00:59,549
NATURALIZED CITIZENS TO BRING IN

31
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:01,718
ESSENTIALLY UNLIMITED NUMBER OF

32
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:04,554
FOREIGN RELATIVES TO THE

33
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:05,254
COUNTRY, EVEN OFTEN DISTANT

34
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:06,222
RELATIVES.

35
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:09,092
HERE TO DISCUSS THIS IS ACTING

36
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:09,792
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF U.S.

37
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,594
CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION.

38
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:12,295
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

39
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:13,596
THANKS FOR BEING IN HERE

40
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:14,163
TONIGHT.

41
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:15,798
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

42
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:16,532
>> Laura: WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT

43
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:18,568
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BUT THAT

44
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:19,736
PART OF THE IMMIGRATION QUESTION

45
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:22,205
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET

46
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:22,672
ABOUT, THAT WHAT

47
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:23,406
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WANTED TO DO

48
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:24,974
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AS WELL

49
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:26,175
AS ENFORCE THE BORDER WE ARE

50
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:28,144
GOING TO TALK ABOUT, IS TO HAVE

51
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:28,778
SENSIBLE LEGAL IMMIGRATION

52
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:30,680
POLICIES THAT BRING IN PEOPLE

53
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,115
THAT CAN REALLY ADD VALUE TO OUR

54
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:32,448
COUNTRY.

55
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:34,684
>> HE CERTAINLY RENEWED THE

56
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:38,621
SPIRIT OF THE MEN AND WOMEN IN

57
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:39,555
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS

58
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:40,556
ENFORCEMENT AT CDP FOR US TO DO

59
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:41,090
MORE ON THE BORDER.

60
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,992
THERE IS A GENEROUS IMMIGRATION

61
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:44,160
SYSTEM BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE ON

62
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,262
THE BORDER AND HE HAS ASKED ALSO

63
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:47,396
FOR THE LOOPHOLES TO BE CLOSED.

64
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:48,097
THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

65
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:50,299
THINGS THAT WE WANT TO SEE GET

66
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:50,600
DONE.

67
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,834
>> Laura: THE ASYLUM FRAUD,

68
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,503
HOW IMPORTANT WITH THAT BEFORE

69
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:54,971
YOU AND THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE

70
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,539
FRONT LINES DOING THIS JOB EVERY

71
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:04,347
DAY TO GET THAT ASYLUM, THE

72
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:05,047
LOOPHOLES IN THAT SYSTEM THAT

73
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:05,815
ALLOWS SO MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN

74
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:06,449
NOW AND THEN JUST FRANKLY,

75
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:06,949
SADLY, DISAPPEAR.

76
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:09,585
>> WE HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE

77
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:10,586
WHERE IF THEY HAVE TO PROCESS

78
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:11,788
THEY HAVE THAT WHILE THEY ARE

79
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:12,588
STILL IN CUSTODY SO THEY ARE NOT

80
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,524
ABUSING THE SYSTEM.

81
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:15,391
>> Laura: SO IN OTHER WORDS

82
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,225
THEY DON'T FULLY AND NEVER SHOW

83
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:17,260
UP FOR THE HEARING WHICH IS WHAT

84
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,362
THEY OFTEN DO.

85
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:20,997
>> WE CAN DO MORE ON THE BORDER.

86
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:22,231
WE ARE DOING BETTER ON THE

87
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:22,565
BORDER.

88
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:23,399
WITH THIS PRESIDENT WE HAVE A

89
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,401
NEW WALL GOING IN.

90
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:26,602
WE HAVE THE NATIONAL GUARD

91
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:27,036
DEPLOYMENTS.

92
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:28,371
>> Laura: TELL US ABOUT THE

93
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:28,671
WALL.

94
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:29,405
I HEAR CONFLICTING THINGS ABOUT

95
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:30,807
THE WALL.

96
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:31,774
WE HEARD THAT OMNIBUS FUND OF

97
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,242
THE WALL BUT THEN WE HEARD IT

98
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:34,277
ACTUALLY DIDN'T FIND THE WALL

99
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:35,344
AND THE PRESIDENT WASN'T TOLD

100
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:36,813
THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT, CERTAINLY

101
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:38,681
NOT THE WALL THAT HE WANTS.

102
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:39,682
>> WE ARE INSTALLING THE WALL

103
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:42,819
RIGHT NOW WHICH IS REPLACING THE

104
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:43,553
FENCE THAT WAS ON THE BOARD AND

105
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:43,820
OUT.

106
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,022
WE HAVE NEW CAPABILITY GOING IN

107
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:46,656
THERE.

108
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,592
NEW CAPABILITY IN SANTA TERESA

109
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,193
NEW MEXICO.

110
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:51,561
WE HAVE PROJECTS AND PLANNING

111
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:54,397
UNDERWAY FOR SOUTH TEXAS AND

112
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:55,097
SAN DIEGO FOR REPLACEMENT IN

113
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:55,765
CALIFORNIA.

114
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:56,432
ALL OF THOSE ARE GOING TO BE

115
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,601
IMPROVED CONDITIONS FOR OUR

116
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:01,204
AGENTS TO WORK IN, SAFER BORDER

117
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:02,405
ENVIRONMENT AND WORK TECHNOLOGY

118
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:02,972
TO GO ALONG WITH IT.

119
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:05,007
>> Laura: I HAD OVER THE YEARS

120
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:06,742
INTERVIEWED SO MANY BORDER

121
00:03:06,742 --> 00:03:08,611
PATROL AGENTS AND CUSTOMS AGENTS

122
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:10,279
WHO WERE SO DEMORALIZED BECAUSE

123
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,114
THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB AND

124
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:14,617
THEY FELT LIKE, I'M NOT TRYING

125
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:16,886
TO GET POLITICAL HERE, BUT UNDER

126
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:17,954
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THEY

127
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,223
WERE KIND OF BEING HELD BACK OR

128
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:22,358
EVEN SOMETIMES VILIFIED UNFAIRLY

129
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:23,092
EVEN SOMETIMES VILIFIED UNFAIRL

130
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:23,459
UNFAIRLY.

131
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,327
TELL ME ABOUT JUST THE

132
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:26,963
GENERAL -- YOU REFERENCED IT

133
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:28,731
BRIEFLY, BUT THE GENERAL MOOD OF

134
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:30,066
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO DO THIS

135
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,634
JOB AND OFTEN TIMES IT IS NOT A

136
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:34,203
SAFE JOB, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.

137
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:35,404
>> THEY TAKE ENORMOUS RISKS AND

138
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:37,607
THEY WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO

139
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,375
THE RENEWED FOCUS ON BORDER

140
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,209
SECURITY HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT

141
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:40,810
FOR US.

142
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,944
ADDING CAPABILITIES, DOING

143
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,412
BETTER, DOING THEM IN A SAFER

144
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:44,480
ENVIRONMENT AND GIVING THEM WHAT

145
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,648
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT, THEY

146
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:47,250
WANT A SAFER BORDER AND NOW WE

147
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,017
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS

148
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:48,818
PRESIDENT TO TRY TO GET MORE OF

149
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,586
THAT CAPABILITY DOWN THERE SO

150
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:52,588
THAT WE CAN DO OUR JOBS.

151
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:54,390
>> Laura: TELL ME WHAT YOU ALL

152
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,358
NEED CONGRESS TO DO.

153
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:56,692
YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS IN CHARGE

154
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:57,393
OF THE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS IN

155
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:59,795
CHARGE OF THE SENATE AND A

156
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:00,496
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO MADE

157
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:04,567
BORDER ENFORCEMENT A PRIMARY

158
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,168
FOCUS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION.

159
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:07,169
>> WE WANTED TO PRIORITIZE

160
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,971
INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN ADD

161
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:09,405
CAPABILITIES.

162
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,706
WE ARE TRYING TO HIRE AGENTS, WE

163
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:12,975
NEED TO DO THAT AND WE ALSO NEED

164
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:13,809
TO CLOSE THE LOOP PULSE.

165
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:15,978
WE NEED THE LOOP TO BE CLOSED ON

166
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:16,478
THE ASYLUM SYSTEM.

167
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,813
WE NEED TO HAVE A WEIGHT OF HOLD

168
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:19,916
PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME INTO THE

169
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,584
COUNTRY UNTIL THEIR TIME TO BE

170
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,485
REMOVED ONCE THEY HAVE THE DUE

171
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:22,818
PROCESS.

172
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:24,086
IF WE CAN DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS

173
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:25,021
AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL HAVE A

174
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:26,856
MUCH SAFER BORDER.

175
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:29,225
FEWER PEOPLE WILL TRY TO TAKE

176
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:29,825
THAT DANGEROUS JOURNEY.

177
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:31,193
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ASKING.

178
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:33,396
>> Laura: WE HAVE PEOPLE IN

179
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,865
CONGRESS NOW, MOSTLY MORE

180
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:36,565
MODERATE LIBERAL REPUBLICANS

181
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:37,266
TRYING TO PUSH A NEW AMNESTY

182
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:41,470
THEY CALL IT, A TECHNICAL WAY OF

183
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,305
GETTING A LOT OF BILLS ON THE

184
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:42,705
FLOOR.

185
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:45,908
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO IT, BUT

186
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:47,009
WOULD AMNESTY OR DANGLING THE

187
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:48,044
PROSPECT OF AMNESTY AT THIS

188
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:49,912
POINT AS WE APPROACH THE SUMMER

189
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,781
MONTHS, WITH THAT MAKE YOUR JOB

190
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:52,782
EASIER OR MORE DIFFICULT GIMMICK

191
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:55,351
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

192
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:56,285
>> Laura: WHICH ONE GIMMICK

193
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:57,486
EASIER OR MORE DIFFICULT GIMMICK

194
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:58,187
>> I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MAKE

195
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,889
IT EASIER.

196
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,190
>> Laura: IT WOULD MAKE IT

197
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,158
MORE DIFFICULT, WOULD IT NOT

198
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:05,962
LIKE THE SUMMER OF 2014      201

199
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:05,995
LIKE THE SUMMER OF 2014      204

200
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:06,028
LIKE THE SUMMER OF 2014      20W

201
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:06,062
LIKE THE SUMMER OF 2014      20T

202
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:06,095
LIKE THE SUMMER OF 2014      20H

203
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:06,128
LIKE THE SUMMER OF 2014      20T

204
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:06,562
LIKE THE SUMMER OF 2014      20E

205
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,563
POSSIBILITY OF AMNESTY AND THERE

206
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:09,165
WAS A BIG WAVE OF UNACCOMPANIED

207
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:12,902
MINORS CROSSING THE BORDER.

208
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:13,569
>> CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES AND

209
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,538
ADDING THE CAPABILITY, BORDER

210
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:17,840
LAW, THE NATIONAL GUARD, GIVING

211
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,009
US MORE TECHNOLOGY ON THE

212
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:20,977
BORDER, HIRING AGENTS, THAT'S

213
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:21,577
WHAT WE NEED.

214
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:22,545
>> Laura: HOW ABOUT THE

215
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:24,647
PROSECUTORS AT THE BORDER,

216
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,983
IMMIGRATION JUDGES DOWN THERE.

217
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,317
AGAIN, THEY HAVE LIKE 6,000 MORE

218
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:31,387
PERSONNEL I BELIEVE, IMMIGRATION

219
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:33,189
OFFICIALS AND JUDGES DOWN THERE,

220
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:34,023
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT I

221
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:34,790
BELIEVE IS GETTING.

222
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,960
BUT WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

223
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,329
PEOPLE CROSSING IN A 3-4 WEEK

224
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:40,763
PERIOD.

225
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:43,432
YOU NEED MORE THAN THAT, DO YOU

226
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:44,033
NOT?

227
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:44,700
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS

228
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,101
STEPPING UP.

229
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:48,170
THEY ARE ADDING RESOURCES.

230
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,672
THE SECRETARY HAS DIRECTED US TO

231
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,574
REFER ALL PEOPLE WHO CROSS THE

232
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:52,308
BORDER ILLEGALLY FOR PROSECUTION

233
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,110
AND SO WE ARE STARTING TO RAMP

234
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,944
UP THOSE CAPABILITIES AS WELL.

235
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:57,046
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE

236
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:59,815
YEARS IS THE CONSEQUENCES OF

237
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:00,783
PEOPLE DOING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.

238
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,418
>> Laura: HEAVEN FORBID YOU

239
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:04,020
ACTUALLY HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR

240
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,587
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

241
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:06,288
KEEP US UPDATED BECAUSE I THINK

242
00:06:06,288 --> 00:00:00,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR
