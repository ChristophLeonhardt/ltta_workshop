so the Supreme Court avoided the big issue so the headline that you're hearing today from the left is oh my god the Supreme Court has stood with religious people against gay people that's what the Supreme Court just did okay first of all here's my view of this case and every other case like it I do not believe that it is the government's job to tell you who you can and cannot do business with and that includes discrimination okay I'm open about this I think that if you want to discriminate against a Jew that is your problem and you know what I will do I will go start an alternative business and I will run you out of business I will go through the business across the street and they will get my patronage and they will run you out of business I think this is true across the board I don't see why this is a freedom of religion issue per se because it seems like a freedom of association issue to me now I understand is unpalatable to people because we have this weird idea in America that if you don't like something it ought to be illegal well I don't like a lot of things I don't think they ought to be illegal I'm not a same-sex marriage fan I don't think it ought to be illegal I'm a libertarian on same-sex marriage I think the government should get completely out of the business of marriage well just as I and libertarian on the issue of same-sex marriage I'm a libertarian on the issue of whether a business owner ought to be forced to cater to a particular population even if that business owner is a jerk even if that business owner is a racist or a homophobe well you want to be a racist or homophobic you're gonna go out of business because that's the way the market works capitalism is the single greatest force for Tolerance in the history of humanity not government control from above okay so that's my perspective on this but this case doesn't go that far it also doesn't go as far as to even say that religious people have a right to act religiously in their business the case doesn't even say that if you are a baker that you have the right to reject catering to a same-sex wedding instead this case has decided 72 on the narrowest possible grounds and that is the Colorado Civil Rights Commission is mean really that's how the case was decided the case is written by Anthony Kennedy who's an ex cripple justice just an awful awful justice he has never seen a copy of the Constitution apparently and so he just sort of wanders around in his bathrobe and depending on whether he had his Metamucil led bowel movement that morning he decides how to rule so here is his ruling today delivering the opinion of the court and there's a nonsensical ruling it's a nonsensical ruling because it doesn't get to any key issue it's good for the particular Baker in this case but it does not establish a broad principle that religious people can actually act religiously in their businesses which you would assume would be protected by freedom of religion I mean when I say freedom of religion generally what I mean is my ability to act religious throughout my life including in my business that's not what the Supreme Court says instead they simply evade the issue
