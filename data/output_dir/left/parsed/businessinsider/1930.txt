my name is Doran Wong executive chef at
unum barbecue in Lower East Side New
York City today we are making our Baku
chassis of pork ribs let's start off
with what the Chinese barbecue is we
marinate the the meats for a couple days
before we cook them very not traditional
from the american version where they
actually cook it for a very long time
and they smoked it
it's marinate for two days and then it's
cooked in a 400 degree oven for about 45
minutes until it becomes nice and golden
brown
you
we actually glaze it with the with honey
so can caramelize the our secret
ingredient to Chinese barbecue is honey
