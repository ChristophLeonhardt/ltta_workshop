the United States economy is surging reaching its strongest growth in four years and President Donald Trump predicts more to come this isn't a one-time shot I happen to think we're gonna do extraordinarily well in our next report next quarter the Trump administration reported that US gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 4.1% almost double the rate in the first three months of the year but many economists don't expect the surge to last with many predicting actual GDP growth will settle to about three percent this year that is because second quarter numbers were boosted by foreign purchases of US soybeans and other products before a trade war raises tariffs on them well I think the growth number today four point one percent in the second quarter is good news but it's very temporary there are two important caveats to the second quarter growth number one is that they were propelled in large part by a sharp increase in government spending coming off the increase in the budget deficit from earlier this year are the tax cuts the second is a sharp spike in exports as traders accelerated shipments to get in ahead of the risk of higher trade barriers coming off the threat of trade wars but President Trump says his actions have helped cut the US trade deficit by fifty billion dollars these tax cuts particularly on the business and investment side are going to be boosting wages livelihoods and jobs for middle American ordinary working folks and it's starting to take effect and that's why I agree with the president this is a boom that will be sustainable wage increases have not kept up with overall economic growth but for an administration facing a lengthy probe into the president's ties to Russia and a diplomatic feud with allies a growing economy and rising employment numbers even in manufacturing is cause for celebration and a hastily scheduled presidential appearance we have added 3.7 million new jobs since the election a number that is unthinkable we are in the midst of the longest positive job growth streak in history those numbers could prove hard to sustain as us trading partners around the globe raised tariffs answering a trade war set off by Trump himself John Hendren al Jazeera
