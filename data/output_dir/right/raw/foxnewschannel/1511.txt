00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:11,491
>> Greg: NEW YORK STATE JUDGE

2
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:12,192
ORDERED A 30-YEAR-OLD MAN TO

3
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:15,929
CLEAR OUT OF HIS PARENTS HOUSE.

4
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,697
MICHAEL ROTONDO DIDN'T PAY RENT

5
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:18,331
OR DO CHORES.

6
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:20,433
BASICALLY HE IS A TINY VERSION

7
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:20,834
OF CONGRESS.

8
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:23,503
HE WAS SUED BY MOM AND DAD AFTER

9
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:25,238
HE REFUSED TO LEAVE.

10
00:00:25,238 --> 00:00:26,539
SELF-EMPLOYED BUSINESSMAN, THE

11
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,708
PARENTS HAVE YET TO SEE ANY OF

12
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,509
MICHAEL'S SECRET SOURCE OF

13
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:30,110
INCOME.

14
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,745
I AM BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT

15
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:33,313
THAT IS.

16
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:35,949
HIS PARENTS HOME WAS ACTUALLY A

17
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:39,519
SANCTUARY CITY.

18
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,454
AND HE REAPS THE BENEFITS,

19
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:42,188
APPARENTLY THINKING EVERYTHING

20
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:43,390
SHOULD BE FREE.

21
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,327
HE ALMOST QUALIFIES AS A

22
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:49,095
COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER OR AT LEAST

23
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:50,096
A VERMONT SENATOR.

24
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:51,898
AFTER A PILE OF IGNORED EVICTION

25
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:54,100
LETTER SOME OF THE JUDGE RULED

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,701
FOR MOM-AND-POP.

27
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,836
BEING GOOD PARENTS, THEY OFFERED

28
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:58,738
HIM MONEY TO HELP THEM FIND A

29
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:01,141
PLACE TO STAY AND FIX HIS CAR.

30
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:03,677
THEY ALSO GAVE HIM SOUND ADVICE,

31
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:05,444
INCLUDING "ORGANIZE THE THINGS

32
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:08,315
YOU NEED FOR WORK AND MANAGE AN

33
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:08,782
APARTMENT.

34
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:13,286
"AND "THERE WILL BE OTHER THINGS

35
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:14,821
THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT VALUE."

36
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:19,125
THERE ARE JOBS AVAILABLE EVEN

37
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,694
FOR THOSE WITH A POOR WORK

38
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:21,895
HISTORY LIKE YOU.

39
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:22,295
GET ONE.

40
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,697
YOU HAVE TO WORK.

41
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:26,833
TRANSLATION: GET OFF YOUR BUTT

42
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,436
AND DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.

43
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:37,477
NOW EVICTED, HE DID SEE HIS

44
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:38,144
PARENTS AFTER THE RULING AND

45
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:38,878
SAID IT WAS PRETTY AWKWARD PRINT

46
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:39,612
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE COME HE COULD

47
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:40,313
ALWAYS MOVE INTO A STARBUCKS.

48
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:41,514
>> Kimberly: THIS IS THE

49
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:42,682
PROBLEM.

50
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,451
THIS IS WHY I'M GOING TO

51
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:44,918
DUNKIN' DONUTS.

52
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,721
>> Greg: KIMBERLY, THIS GUY'S

53
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,089
ALL OVER THE NEWS.

54
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:50,490
HE'S GOING TO BE ON

55
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,124
MARTHA MacCALLUM TONIGHT.

56
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:54,527
I MOVED IN WITH MY MOM WHEN I

57
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:54,961
WAS 23.

58
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,495
I SAVED FOR A YEAR.

59
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,297
I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

60
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:58,698
THIS KID IS PUSHING IT.

61
00:01:58,698 --> 00:01:59,899
>> Kimberly: HE IS PUSHING IT.

62
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,434
DIDN'T HE GO BACK TO THEIR HOUSE

63
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,936
AFTER THE JUDGE TOLD HIM TO GET

64
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:05,839
A LIFE AND GET A JOB.

65
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,708
KNOCK, KNOCK.

66
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,377
HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO FIND SOME

67
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,311
POOR UNFORTUNATE INDIVIDUAL WHO

68
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:12,278
WILL TAKE HIM IN.

69
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:14,981
HE'S GOT HIS 15 MINUTES OF FAME.

70
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,083
PEOPLE TAKING SELFIES WITH THIS

71
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:17,350
GUY.

72
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,485
WHEN THAT PASSES OVER COME I

73
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,286
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO DO.

74
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:22,389
PROBABLY MOVE BACK IN WITH HIS

75
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:22,889
PARENTS.

76
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,724
WHAT KIND OF SELF-RESPECT DOES

77
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:25,091
HE HAVE?

78
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:26,326
HIS PARENTS ARE SO SWEET.

79
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:28,795
>> Dana: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

80
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:29,329
GET A GIRL?

81
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,398
>> Kimberly: HE GOT ONE FOR A

82
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:32,832
SECOND, I GUESS.

83
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,338
>> Greg: YOU KNOW WHAT THE

84
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:40,340
SOLUTION IS, MOVEMENT AND BECOME

85
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,341
A BUTLER.

86
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,043
BECOME SOMEONE'S BUTLER.

87
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:46,579
BUT A BAD ONE, A LAZY ONE.

88
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,215
>> Richard: I THINK THE WORD

89
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:51,217
MILLENNIAL IN THE SCREEN BEHIND

90
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:53,119
ME.

91
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:55,755
>> Dana: THAT BOTHERS YOU?

92
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:57,324
>> Richard: I PACKED UP AND

93
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:59,159
WENT TO COLLEGE AND 18.

94
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,094
I WAS LIKE MOM, I AM NEVER

95
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,095
COMING BACK HOME.

96
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,496
YOU COULD ALWAYS COME HOME.

97
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:05,398
NO, I'M GOING TO GET A JOB AND

98
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:06,766
WORK AND THAT'S WHAT MY FRIENDS

99
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,701
DID AND WE ARE DOING GREAT AND

100
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:10,637
WE ARE ALL MILLENNIAL.

101
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:11,771
THEY WORK AND THEY HAVE THEIR

102
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,206
OWN APARTMENTS AND THEY DON'T

103
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,074
LIVE AT HOME WITH THEIR PARENTS

104
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:17,510
AND THEY PAY RENT.

105
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,347
>> Greg: THIS IS ON AN EARLIER

106
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:23,116
SHOW, ON THEIR NETWORK, I CAN'T

107
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:24,617
THINK OF THE NAME OF IT.

108
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:27,220
>> DO YOU NOT WANT TO FIND YOUR

109
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,587
OWN PLACE?

110
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:30,490
>> NO.

111
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,091
>> WHY NOT?

112
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,594
>> I DON'T WANT TO LIVE THERE

113
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:34,928
ANYMORE.

114
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:36,696
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH

115
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:37,163
YOUR PARENTS?

116
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:37,597
>> NO.

117
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,700
>> WHY DON'T YOU MOVE OUT

118
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,067
TOMORROW?

119
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,202
>> I DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO DO

120
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:45,305
THAT TOMORROW.

121
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:47,173
>> DO YOU HAVE A JOB?

122
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:55,048
>> NO.

123
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:57,717
>> DON'T YOU WANT TO RECONCILE?

124
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:02,088
>> NO.

125
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:04,491
>> Dana: I KIND OF FEEL BAD.

126
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:06,359
I FEEL BAD FOR EVERYBODY.

127
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:07,694
>> Greg: YOU DO.

128
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:09,095
HE IS DOING THE TV.

129
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,930
HE COULD HAVE MOVED OUT.

130
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,399
HE >> Dana: I THINK THE LURE

131
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,667
OF BEING ON TV, I WILL GO INTO

132
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:18,004
THE INTO MY STORY.

133
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:23,076
EVERYBODY, I'M SURE

134
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,711
MARTHA MacCALLUM WILL BE ABLE

135
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:26,279
TO GET MORE OUT OF HIM.

136
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,215
>> Pete: HE IS BAD AT BEING A

137
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:28,582
DEADBEAT.

138
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,183
HE WANT TO STAY AT YOUR PARENTS

139
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,719
HOUSE FOREVER?

140
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,321
MAKE THEM DINNER ONCE IN A

141
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:35,689
WHILE.

142
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:36,156
DO SOME CHORES.

143
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:38,091
DO A COUPLE CHORES.

144
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:40,293
THEN THEY GIVE YOU ANOTHER YEAR.

145
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,495
INSTEAD HE IS LIKE, I WILL DO

146
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:43,096
NOTHING.

147
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:43,964
YOU WILL HAVE TO EVICT ME.

148
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,198
>> Dana: IT'S A WEIRD THING

149
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:48,702
HAVING TO GO TO COURT.

150
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:49,836
>> Kimberly: WHY DIDN'T THEY

151
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:50,270
CALL THE COPS?

152
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,439
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

153
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,908
>> Dana: RONAN COMES HOME,

154
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:58,478
IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN ARMS.

155
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,646
>> Greg: I'M GOING TO DEFEND

156
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:01,581
HIM AND SAY BECAUSE WE ARE

157
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:04,684
LIVING LONGER, 31 IS THE NEW 13.

158
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:07,154
>> Dana: I AGREE.

159
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:09,656
>> Richard: I AM 31 AND I AM

160
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:09,990
NOT 13.

161
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,893
>> Greg: I BEG TO DIFFER.

162
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:13,727
LIVING LONGER.

163
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,228
YOU CAN STAY LONGER AT HOME.

164
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:17,531
>> Dana: IT'S A GOOD POINT.

165
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:18,932
WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE AGE?

166
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,201
LET'S SAY IT'S 25.

167
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:23,303
KIDS SHOULD BE ON THEIR PARENT'S

168
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:24,538
HEALTH INSURANCE UNTIL 25.

169
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:27,340
I DON'T SAY THAT BUT THE LAW

170
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,542
SAYS THAT.

171
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:28,809
26.

172
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:29,075
30.

173
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,545
MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT.

174
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:34,448
>> Greg: I AM FOR CLOSE

175
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:35,549
FAMILIES, MULTIGENERATIONAL

176
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:35,916
FAMILIES.

177
00:05:35,916 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, THEY ARE
