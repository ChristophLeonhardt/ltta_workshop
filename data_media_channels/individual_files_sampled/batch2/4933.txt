day 463 of the Trump administration brought an end to another week of this president trying to balance his own legal battles with the running of the White House and while conducting foreign affairs and what at first sounded like something of a break from a federal judge today wound up more like a good-news bad-news proposition a few hours ago a federal judge agreed to a 90-day delay in the stormy Daniels suit against the President and notably his attorney Michael Cohen but in doing that the judge agreed it appeared likely Cohen will face charges linked to that separate criminal investigation this week the president's ties to Cohen were back in the spotlight amid speculation about a possible pardon mr. president what about Michael Cohen are are you considering it thank you very much stupid question mr. Trump was also asked for details about his relationship to Cohen mr. president how much of your legal work was handled by Michael Cohen well as a percentage of my overall legal work a tiny tiny little fraction he represents me like with this crazy stormy Daniels deal he represented me and you know from what I see he did absolutely nothing wrong crucial comment right there it turned out meanwhile it's been reported that the newest member of the president's legal team won Rudolph Giuliani of New York is trying to work out an interview between Trump and Special Counsel Robert Muller today the president welcomed the House Intel committee's finding authored only by the Republicans on that committee they're in the majority that there was no cooperation with Russia by the Trump campaign it's a witch hunt that's all it is I've always said there was no collision the constant churn in the president's cabinet was also a theme this past week as we witness the precipitous collapse of White House dr. Ronnie Jackson's bid to run the VA according to reports tonight Jackson has gone back to work in the White House medical office his nomination came under intense scrutiny amid allegations of drinking on duty misuse of medications and at one point this week the president seemed to sit just Jackson should end his quest for the job I wouldn't if I were him I really don't think personally he should do it so after Jackson did drop out the president hinted partisan politics that made it hard for Jackson to continue I called him today I said in a certain way you're in a in a very big way you're an American Hero because you've exposed the system for some horrible things I've had it happen to me with the Russian collusion hoax to hoax this week the president also played host to two critically important leaders but in very different ways he welcomed French President Emmanuel macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House at the top of both leaders agendas keeping the u.s. from leaving that Iran nuclear deal president Trump appeared to be mostly focused on warning Iran about resuming its nuclear program they're not gonna be restarting anything they restarted taking up big problems bigger than they've ever had before Trump continued his efforts to remake u.s. foreign policy by talking up the remarkable summit between the leaders of North and South Korea and putting himself at the center of the effort to end decades of hostility do you feel like it's your responsibility for this to eventually get settled between North and South Korea I think I have a responsibility I think other presidents should have done it I think the responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the President of the United States and I think we have I think I have a responsibility to see if I can do it and if I can't do it it'll be a very tough time for a lot of countries and a lot of people it's certainly something that I hope I can do for the world we get a kick every once in a while out of the fact that I'll be watching people that fail so badly over the last 25 years explaining to me how to make a deal with North Korea I get a big big kick out of that let's bring in our leadoff panels shall we for another Friday night we are so happy to welcome to our broadcast Katie Rogers White House correspondent for The New York Times catherine Lucey is back with us White House reporter for The Associated Press as his Jeremy bash former chief of staff at CIA in the Pentagon and an MSNBC national security analyst hey Jeremy I want to do something unusual and that is first things first go back up to our our list of particulars about the news today and ask you what we should think about this federal judge ruling in the Trump cohen matter well cohen won the battle but he lost the war because he won a 90-day reprieve from the civil suit that was filed by stormy Daniels and her attorney against him basically to nullify that hush agreement where Michael Cohen on behalf of President Trump paid Storme 160 thousand dollars so the G federal judge there said we can't go forward with the civil suit why because Michael Cohen is likely going to be indicted based on evidence collected by that rate on his offices his hotel in his home and therefore there's too much factual overlap between the civil case regarding stormy Daniels and the federal criminal investigation into Michael Cohen's conduct and so Brian just to kind of wrap this up here you have a very distressing development if you're in the Michael Cohen legal camp so Katie if you were assigned the news analysis thought piece for tomorrow's New York Times as people left the West Wing tonight people on the staff what do you think the mood was after this week that was well luckily I'm not assigned that news analysis Brian thanks for having me by the way I think that it's one of the things that strikes me about the West Wing is how much it takes to rattle them at this point they describe their work as in the trenches with each other I do think that one of the the obstacles for this crew now will be dealing with the president who's obviously very frustrated with the ongoing investigation and also who appears to be visibly trying to distance himself from Michael Cohen I think as Michael Cohen's legal problems mount there's there's a growing distance there and I think you know for White House aides I think managing that managing his tendency to sort of go back and forth on on Cohen I think last week he was encouraging him to stay on Twitter and and yesterday it was a stupid question and then it was I barely know the guy on Fox and Friends so I think for the West Wing AIDS just knowing which end is up is is is often a problem and Catherine now it can be told yours was the voice in the distance that got President Trump to react to the one hundred thirty thousand dollar payment he was standing in the doorway in front of the press cabin there in Air Force One making the choice not to of course enter the press cabin on Air Force One how surprised were you to hear that he went there on cowan Vasavi stormy on Fox and Friends well it was notable wasn't it Brian I mean two weeks ago when asked did you know about this hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment he said no I asked you know why did Cohen make it then and he said you know Michael Cohen is my lawyer you'll have to ask Michael but then this week on Fox and Friends he he seemed to you know he I mean he's clearly said that but the Cohen did represent him and quote this crazy stormy Daniels deal so he seems to be struggling with what he should say in this matter and you saw he said two things with Fox and Friends he spoke about : represented him at the same time he also said he does a tiny fraction of my legal work and you saw in court in New York you know those words were quickly seized upon as an example of why you know certain papers should be should be a usable and not subject to attorney-client privilege so one thing that it shows is that every time he speaks about this I mean it's potentially creates new legal vulnerabilities for him hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC
