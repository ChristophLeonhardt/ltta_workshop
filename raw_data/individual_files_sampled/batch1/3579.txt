please welcome Richard plepler with Henry Blodgett thanks everybody so Richard seven years ago everybody thought Netflix was a complete joke you were the gorilla in the industry I did not think that a lot of people did people less smart than you or less prophetic than you then two or three years ago suddenly Netflix blows past you you're the old dinosaur HBO in trouble doesn't have the retail model that Netflix has this year I look at your last quarter you have 12% subscriber revenue growth for a business that's supposed to be dying you were incredibly alive all around the world what's going on why why are you not dead so I think I think yes remember what was Twain's great line you know rumors of our demise were quite premature so I think a couple things are going on we took a look at the marketplace five years ago and everybody thought we were kind of locked in it 30% penetration and I asked a simple question of the team and of some pollsters who we brought in which is are we so in love with ourselves that we just assumed that everybody out there knows what this brand is that everybody out there just assumes they understand what's in our library and I think maybe we're wrong about that and there's a kind of undecided vote out there and if we explained it to them better would that matter and would that enable us to get closer to 50% maybe 60% penetration in the country and they're the the research came back and said look your instinct is exactly right there is a huge undecided vote out there they don't understand what's in your library they don't understand you have 3,000 hours of programming they don't know the range of your content they don't realize you have for Hollywood movie studios first pay window they don't get all that and so at that moment there were only say beginning 15 5 million broadband only homes in the United States we hypothesized that was obviously going to move exponentially and if we could talk directly to our consumer and then we could convince our partners in the traditional ecosystem that there was gold in the hills and we could motivate them to package and market us we saw a real opportunity for growth so that's why we built our streaming service that's why when we negotiated our deals with our partners over the course of the last 18 months two years we built deals that drove scale and were motivated to give them an opportunity to drop their net effective rates that they were paying us we understood that the wholesale rate and the retail rate of HBO had essentially gone as high as it could go without running out of runway and what we wanted to do is incentivize our partners so that they could see the opportunity in getting to 50% and above with penetration so we did both of those things over two year period and the dig on us when we did it was I remember my my my friend rich greenfield saying on investor day in 14 well what do you guys know about technology you're not gonna be able to do it and to even if you do do it you're gonna cannibalize your core business and we said well give us an opportunity to partner with the right people we'll build a streaming service it'll work and by the way it won't be cannibalistic it'll simply increase the pot and fortunately that's exactly what's happened and we're on track for our biggest year in history in terms of subscriber revenue growth and I see that revenue curve just growing over the coming years so why how do we compete in the most intense environment oh just to stop you make sure I understand so it's not coming from price increases no it's actually coming from price decreases on average because you're going out to noodle device it exactly at $14.99 incentivizing the our partners in the traditional cable satellite telco business with penetration in scale their net effective rates go down and keeping our retail price at $14.99 in in the digital universe none of this would matter if the product weren't good right and so I think people you know ask us all the time well you know Netflix is spending this amount of money and Amazon is spending that amount of money and Hulu is spending and everybody's spending money and everybody's competing and everybody's taking a page out of your book that's all true but our brand means something and it means to us the curation of excellence and fortunately it also means that to talented writers and producers and directors and actors who understand that it means something to be inside the HBO cocoon and so I think the I've said before and I think it has a virtue of truth the best brand ambassadors for HBO are not all of us in executive chairs the best brand ambassadors for HBO are the talent because when people come inside the company to work whether it's Nicole Kidman Reese Witherspoon doing big little lies a Steve Zaillian who wrote the night of or De Niro who did Wizard of lies whoever it is they have an experience because the marketing experience is bespoke the promotion is bespoke the development process is unique they become kind of catalytic prosthetists for our brand and that's infectious so or not really is what brings the line at the door so just so I totally understand so are you saying that it's not just about money and when folks say hey next year Netflix is gonna spend eight billion you have 2.7 billion I guess this year to spend you're saying DeNiro and Reese are going to do business with you even if you pay them less than Netflix obviously we have to pay competitively with the market and we will what I'm saying too is that when people have an experience of working in the company I think it's differentiated and if I was full of in saying that and our team was full of in saying that we would lose the opportunity to work with the next generation and the next group that's coming in the door but what's happening is that the line at our door of talent is bigger as we sit here today in November of 17 than it was last year or the year before there's no shortage of people who are bringing us ideas every Friday in our in our company we know of something we didn't know about the previous Monday so we have to spend and we're gonna take some of this revenue growth that you spoke about and I spoke about a minute ago and we're going to invest that more and more in content because the key for us is making sure that we have a product which is always reflective of the implicit promise we make to our consumer which is you are going to get a kind of curated excellence across all genres doc use half hours late night miniseries hours plus hour for Hollywood studios that we have to continue to deliver on if we don't do that then we don't deserve and nor will we continue to grow but I like our batting average I like our team and I like the range of people who want to come work for us that's I think our great advantage so one mistake that I think a lot of analysts have made about the media industry is they've assumed that it is like the technology industry in which you have five ideas start at once three years later there's one with 95% of the market most the others are toast maybe somebody has some crumbs in media it's not a winner-take-all game multiple survive absolutely un Netflix are both crushing it right but how many can crush it hulu has won Amazon Prime so many others how many are going to survive I don't know how many are gonna survive but I know that in a I think there's so much there's such a surfeit of content out in the ecosystem life right you you eat I'm a junkie I'm a journalistic junkie I'm a culture junkie you can't see everything right I try to tap into competitors work I try to look at everything there are some things I watch all the way through but no matter how much time you have and I do this for a living you can't keep up with everything so brands amidst all that clutter matter more than ever and what our brand has has always stood for and will continue to stand for is excellence and quality and so if we do that and if we keep delivering on that so that people recognize they may not love everything I'm tribe said before I'm trying to build attics and I want people addicted to something every week and they come in they watched John Oliver they get excited they come back and they say I missed the deuce I missed big little lies I miss curb I'm gonna go over I'm gonna go over here and watch insecure once we get them into the house we think that becomes a very engaging and dynamic experience and what what we're seeing is less churn more engagement more subscriber satisfaction and we want to put our foot on the accelerator and do more of that for us for me I I want us never to your question about money I want us never to have to say no to what we want to say yes to and that's my marker just we're not to say yes to everything we're not gonna have every great show I've said I say this when I talked to Ted Saran Desai say this when I talked to les I say this when at Doug comes crowns great good for you stranger things is great good for you do you think that takes anything away from Westworld the biggest first year show in the history of HBO you think that takes anything away from big little lies from the night of from from Thrones of course not did you want to say yes to the Lord of the Rings before Amazon came in and paid 200 million dollars no no and I'll tell you why because we are working on a number of prequels to Thrones we have one two three four five separate Bibles that have been submitted a couple of them that were particularly high on i'd rather own our IP one hundred percent like we do with thrones and I'd rather have the ability to work with a product that is inextricably linked to our brand and then monetize that out across the world so if I have to make a bet on a genre piece I'm gonna go with the Game of Thrones prequel I'm gonna go with the Game of Thrones prequel that is part of our brand Halo and we felt very comfortable with that so you disagree with folks who say that now that Game of Thrones n me you're toast well that I mean look that's kind of I mean when I got had my old job you know seven I became co-president and I sat at the Television Critics my first television critics thing in their first question was I just bit of that tone which was oh ho Sopranos off the air Sex in the City you guys suck The Times wrote a piece five minutes after I got my old job that said HBO's competitors say they've stumbled with a particularly shitty picture of me up in the right-hand corner of the New York business section in The New York Times and we just said look we're gonna roll up our sleeves they're never gonna be another Sopranos and everybody know this but what there's going to be is the next great creative idea and in came Alan Ball with True Blood and in came this young lady who had never done a TV show and her life named Lena Dunham called girls and in came Amanda we annucci with a parody and satire in American politics called V and there came Mike judge with this idea to take a look at the preciousness of the of the tech world and induce Silicon Valley and then there were these two guys who had never done a TV show in their life right who had very very almost no experience in the entertainment industry pitching a fantasy show with dragons to us and we believed in them and we bet on them and it was a good bet and so the key for us is are we a magnet for the next great writers I think we are like a gallery right we are like an art gallery and we want to be the place where the best artists want to hang their stuff you're gonna have emerging artists contemporary artists you can have masters pointillist you can have all kinds of different painters the that our job is to make that our environment exciting for them and dynamic for them and addictive for them and I think the fact that we've done that don't trust me listen to them is the reason the line is as big as it is and the reason we're so excited about the next generation of shows that are currently being produced developed in may so what is the next game of Thrones then is it West world you mention well again I'd give you the exact I think Westeros fantastic West world by the way is double the number in its first year on HBO thirteen million that Game of Thrones was in its first year just so we're clear and when people get into this what's the you know Bill Goldman the great writer of all the President's Men and Butch Cassidy had this wonderful line about our business which has the which is true which is nobody knows anything and and there there's there's a great deal of veracity to that what you know is that you are working with people with whom you have a shared vision and whose voice you trust and then you're making bets on the writers and the talent that come in Nick pizzolatto who did true detective is just written the first five scripts of season three and they're fantastic and the big little lies guys David Kelly's master has written the next iteration of big little lies and Steve Zaillian is out working on the night up and I told you about the prequel one of them is being written by a guy called Bryan cogman who was an apprentice of David and Dan and then became one of the leading writers on the show Jesse Armstrong produced by frank rich's written a show called succession starring Brian Cox which is the story of a media Canadian media potentate who's turning 80 it's not meant to be you know it's not about anybody but it's it's it's about a potentate who's meant to give his Empire over to his second oldest son on his 80th birthday changes his mind the Faustian nature of power stories of fathers and sons families I just kind of dynasty for smart people is one way to look at the show so we have this young writer named Misha Greene as adopting the series the literary series Lovecraft which is horror and in the 1950s in the south which I think is maybe the best first script we've seen in a long time Damon with JJ Abrams Damon Lindelof is doing watch man so I don't know which one of those turns into two gold they may all turn into gold but we're working with people we believe in we're working with people who we have a kind of shorthand with and that's how we do it and we trust that if nobody knows anything and Netflix is now able to spend more than twice as much money as you can spend Amazon who let's not overdo the bill Goldman I think I think I think what I think that what would bill go man let's just be clear on this is important what Goldman was saying was no one knows when something is going to hit the zeitgeist in the way that Sopranos did in the way that Thrones did let me be clear because I was in the room Annie and I had to make the throne anyone who tells you we knew that Thrones was going to be Thrones is completely full of okay you don't know that you just know these are great storytellers they're working off great IP which is George RR Martin's extraordinary books and you got an unbelievable team of producers and in talented filmmakers let's make the bat so you do know something which is that you're working with talent that you believe in and you're telling a story that you think is going to resonate that it that it hits that part of the cultural imagination in that way nobody knows that so don't don't it can't be so reductive that you know what we're just sitting here throwing darts against the board that's that's not right what we're saying is you never know where the next great thing is so what you want to do is work across the canvas with a wide range of talent and if you make enough bets you're going to hit the kinds of gold that I think are if you look at us over the last decade we have a pretty good batting average some years ago when Netflix made its first big bad hundred million dollars for house of cards everyone says just ridiculous it's gonna bomb turned out to be a huge home run I gather Jeff Bezos said recently I want a game of Thrones and he came up with Lord of the Rings you took a good look at it Amazon has paid again reportedly two hundred to two hundred and fifty million for it is this a house of cards or is it a Marco Polo nobody knows but if I'm Jeff Bezos that's monopoly money so you know he he wants to make a bet on a great franchise which by the way are cousins at Warner Brothers you know have a piece of that's a that's a good bet why not make that bet we don't need to make that bet because we have something quite precious which is a franchise called Game of Thrones and we're not manufacturing the creative idea with the prequel the creative idea is coming to us with energy and vision from the creative team from Bryan cogman who's been a part of this the whole time we're not going out and saying you know what go find us a prequel to Game of Thrones they're coming to us and saying we have an idea and then another team's coming in and saying so do we so we've let a thousand flowers bloom in terms of the pilot process and I think you know we'll probably get a couple of very good ideas out of that so another trend that's become clear over the last decade is just what an international business this is you now have I think a hundred and thirty million subscriber through one hundred and thirty five million around the world take us ahead five ten years how big can HBO how big could Netflix get are we still looking at this and saying hey wait a minute it's gonna cap around 150 200 million people or a billion people is that it is that a look first you got to walk the cat back just a little bit to our international strategy which is different than Netflix's international strategy for decidedly important reasons we have networks in 60 countries in Latin America and in Asia in in Eastern Europe and then we have licensing deals in about 130 countries and then we have particular arrangements in very big markets like England in Germany in Canada and Australia we're in 17 separate countries where we have what's called home of HBO deals so we lend our name and it's Sky Atlantic home of HBO in Great Britain Sky Italia home of HBO and in Italy those are very very high margin low risk revenue deals and we have them going out you know for the next three four years and then we have an OTT business because we will have one global platform by by next year and our OTT business and Nordics in Spain and elsewhere is growing as well and so what we're gonna do over the next couple of years is we're gonna look at each market and we're gonna make a decision whether or not it's smarter for us to build OTT businesses because we own our own content in more countries than we have them or whether the licensing deals that we're doing in those countries where the price of content as you know is going up our deals have great margins they're going up and so we're just looking market by market and deciding where the profits are and where the great long-range plan is if I were betting I would think you would see more and more OTT but we're gonna take it on a case by case by case basis how big can it go content with this is interesting parenthetical by the way in each country indigenous programming even in our networks businesses indigenous programming made in Brazil made in Argentina made in Singapore made in Malaysia right outperforms even our programming even Thrones even Westworld sometimes by two to three to one so we have raised our budget in opie around the world by 20 to 23 percent and we're doing more and more original programming leaving the kind of patina of HBO in the hands of our local partners in our local offices because we're watching how well that programming is doing so the key there just like here is differentiated content that resonates in that marketplace what we wanted to build internationally this is important is the same thing we wanted to build domestically optionality for the consumer so as we saw that broadband only audience rising we said this is not that complicated it was five million then it was eight and a half million when I stood on stage in Cupertino and announced our deal with Apple it's 19 and a half million or so right now 19 million and we're growing very robustly in that market but but the large preponderance people are still watching through cable satellite Intel Co packages so we want to be there as well and remember we weren't fully penetrated basic cable networks were largely fully penetrated we had a very low penetration rate and so as those packages began to break up that was actually a good thing for HBO because buying HBO off 60 or $70 package skinnier bundle was better than having to buy it off 110 dollar package same same thing is true around the globe we want optionality there too so the reason we enhanced our technology the reason we built a big office in Seattle the reason we have world-class engineers working for us now is so we have that flexibility and dexterity to move however we wanted so your parent company is in the midst of purgatory and this big deal that trying to do with AT&T can you tell us what's gonna happen yeah I am you know look I know what basically what you know from reading the papers you know they'll apparently be a case you know the arguments as well as I do there's never been a vertical merger in 40 years which has been upended I would say just speaking from the HBO chair that one of these theories that I've heard which is that somehow the price it is gonna raise the price of HBO for its competitors would be so disagree the business over the last year and a half two years be so disick anomic for us to do that or to step on our toes by creating this disincentives for Comcast or for spectrum or for Verizon or for dish or for anybody else not to mention what it would do to the exponential growth of our digital business so we have strove to do the exact opposite we have strove to motivate them to lower prices not to raise prices because we saw growth in scale and in penetration not in price increases so I'm having a little bit of trouble getting my arms around that theory of the case that's from our chair I don't see how that makes sense but you know that that will be you know and anecdotally to support your argument in fact ask you another question is I was on the phone with my AT&T Wireless representatives perhaps less somewhere around a year ago and they said oh we're talking about my bill and they said well wouldn't you like our new plan which is considerably less expensive than the one you're playing and by the way will give you HBO for free so that's not a bad price how much do you get of that how does that well that it is not for free.you them to us right exactly we're getting paid as I Godfather to Hyman Roth always makes money for his partners we always make money for our partners and they have to pay us the wholesale price that we've agreed to as their penetration look the deal that we did with AT&T in the summer of 2016 the HBO deal with 18k had a couple of very central tenants in it which punctuated everything I just said to you we said to them look you guys are penetrating somewhere in the high 30s Direct TV which you've just bought is not doing as well let's build some incentives for you guys to get up above 50% and I don't care if you sell it here I don't care if you sell it on Direct TV now I don't care if you sell it on Direct TV let's get you guys motivated to package and market HBO and as you do your price will go down and that's the deal that we did with AT&T that's a good deal for 18t that's a good deal for the consumer and that's a good deal for HBO and if they want to market it that way we can't control the retail price or the retail strategy of our partners we can the wholesale price and that's the deal we built for them they're doing that now and to finish my personal anecdote we have HBO from our cable provider in the living room and now I get HBO for free from 18t are you getting paid twice for me sure thank you wonderful that is a good business Richard thank you so much pleasure to have you nice to make you all you
