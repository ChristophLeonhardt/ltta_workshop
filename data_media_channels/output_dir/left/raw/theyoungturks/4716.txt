1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,390
>> WE ARE LESS THAN ONE WEEK OUT
FROM THE PHILANDO CASTILE

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,610
VERDICT WHERE A POLICE OFFICER
WHO ON CAMERA MURDERED HIM AND

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,800
WALKED FREE.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,290
SINCE THEN SEVERAL

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,429
MORE VIDEOS HAVE BEEN RELEASED.

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,150
EACH ONE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,150
WATCH.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,460
WE HAVE ONE FOR YOU TODAY
TO GIVE YOU AN INDICATION OF

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,440
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE
MINUTES IMMEDIATELY AFTER

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,429
PHILANDO CASTILE WAS SHOT.

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,130
WARNING, THIS ONE IS

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,659
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO WATCH.

13
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:36,280
>>
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,770
>> CHILD CRYING.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:57,960
>> I WANT TO TAKE THESE OFF.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:24,060
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SHOOT ME

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,780
OKAY.

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:42,690
I'M ALREADY IN HANDCUFFS.

19
00:01:42,690 --> 00:02:05,060
TELL THEM YOU WISH THAT THEY

20
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,720
DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL ME.

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,320
>> I MEAN, I REALLY WATCH THAT
VIDEO BUT WATCHING IT AGAIN ñ

22
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,420
THAT IS A FOUR-YEAR-OLD KID.

23
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,130
THE
VIDEO WAS SHOT IN THE BACK OF A

24
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,810
SQUAD CAR.

25
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,810
PHILANDO CASTILE'S
GIRLFRIEND, AND THEIR DAUGHTER.

26
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,060
IT IS A FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,250
SAYING I WANT THIS TOWN
TO BE SAFER.

28
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,430
THE SHOOTING WAS BY A
POLICE OFFICER.

29
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,650
>> IT IS OBVIOUS SHE WAS
BRAINWASHED BY BLACK LIVES

30
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,910
MATTER.

31
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,620
SHE WORRIES ABOUT THESE
THINGS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE

32
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,940
HAS BEEN TOLD THAT IS WHAT

33
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,980
ACTUALLY HAPPENS.

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,160
SHE IS IN THE
BACK OF A POLICE CAR AFTER

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,910
WATCHING HER FATHER GET SHOT

36
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,520
MULTIPLE TIMES.

37
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,000
AND SHE WAS IN
THE LINE OF FIRE ON TOP OF IT.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
AND NOW SHE IS IN THE BACK OF A

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,849
POLICE CAR WITH ENOUGH
WHEREWITHAL TO TELL HER MOTHER

40
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,910
TO KEEP HER HANDCUFFS ON.

41
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,590
HOW
MANY OF YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN IN

42
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,660
THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR?

43
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,790
HOW
MANY ADULTS?

44
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,470
WERE YOU SCARED OR

45
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,470
WORRIED?

46
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,380
OR DID YOU HAVE ENOUGH
WHEREWITHAL TO CALM THE PERSON

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,040
DOWN NEXT TO YOU WHO WAS AN

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,810
ADULT AND TALK TO HER BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING MORE TO

49
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,810
HAPPEN?

50
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,220
BECAUSE SHE WANTS THIS
TOWN TO BE SAFER.

51
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
THIS ASS HAT

52
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,460
THAT RAN SOME CAMPAIGN ñ I THINK
IT WAS A LOCAL OFFICE, A FORMER

53
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,690
POLICE OFFICER AND HIS AD HAD
POLICE CARS RACING DOWN THE

54
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,800
STREET.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,700
THAT IS NOT SAFE TO A
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.

56
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,900
YOU CAN KEEP CALLING PEOPLE BAD

57
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:56,390
GUYS, OR IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF
BLACK PEOPLE TO BE EVIL.

58
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,390
DO YOU

59
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,390
THINK SHE IS?

60
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,430
OR DO YOU THINK
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILL TEACH

61
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,860
HER THAT SHE CAN'T TRUST YOU?

62
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,150
WHICH ONE IS IT?

63
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,720
IS IT LEARNED

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,930
OR IS IT NATURAL?

65
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,830
YOU HAVE TO
ASK

66
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:20,519
YOURSELF THAT QUESTION.

67
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,460
>> YOUR POINT REMINDED ME OF
WHAT SCARBOROUGH SAID ABOUT

68
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,490
MUSLIMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

69
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,620
THEY
HATE US BECAUSE THEY HATE US.

70
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,400
NO, THERE IS USUALLY A REASON.

71
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,139
THEY SAY WHY DO BLACK PEOPLE RUN

72
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,990
AWAY FROM THE COPS?

73
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,539
WELL, THIS

74
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,860
IS A REASON.

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,689
I BOTH CAN'T
BELIEVE AND CAN BELIEVE THE

76
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,339
SECOND AMENDMENT AND THESEUS IN
THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT GOING

77
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,860
LITERALLY BALLISTIC OVER THIS

78
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,860
CASE.

79
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,910
HERE IS A GUY WHO HAD
EVERY RIGHT TO CARRY THAT

80
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,449
WEAPON.

81
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,300
IF YOU REMEMBER THIS

82
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:04,319
CASE, THIS GUY GETS PULLED OVER,
HE'S JUST IN THE WRONG PART OF

83
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:11,470
TOWN BEING BLACK.

84
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,789
HE IS A
LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, HE HAS A

85
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:20,120
GOOD JOB, NOT IN TROUBLE WITH
THE LAW BUT THEY KEEP PULLING

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
HIM OVER.

87
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,139
THEY DON'T GIVE HIM
TICKETS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO

88
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,280
ANYTHING WRONG.

89
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,840
IN THIS CASE HE
GETS PULLED OVER AND SAYS

90
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,719
OFFICER, I HAVE A LEGALLY

91
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,800
REGISTERED WEAPON.

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,300
THE GUY FLIPS
OUT AND SHOOTS HIM.

93
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,360
WHAT WAS THE

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,339
CUP CHARGED WITH?

95
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,089
2ND DEGREE

96
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,469
MANSLAUGHTER.

97
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:44,800
IT'S NOT
FIRST-DEGREE, SECOND-DEGREE.

98
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
HE

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:54,550
HAD TO SHOW THAT IT WAS SO
NEGLIGENT BUT IT LED TO THE MEN

100
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,509
DYING.

101
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:58,259
AND HE WAS ALSO CHARGED
WITH TWO FELONY COUNTS OF

102
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,349
INTENTIONALLY DISCHARGING THE
GUN.

103
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:01,460
HE DIDN'T EVEN GET

104
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,889
CONVICTED OF THAT.

105
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,160
NOTHING AT ALL.

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,750
>>DID HE ACCIDENTALLY DISCHARGED
IT SEVEN TIMES?

107
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,750
>> IF YOU ARE A SECOND AMENDMENT
ADVOCATE DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF

108
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,319
YOU SAY YOU CARRY YOUR WEAPON
LEGALLY AND YOU TELL AN OFFICER

109
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,660
HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO EXECUTE
YOU?

110
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,039
THE GUY GOT ACQUITTED, SO I

111
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:27,189
GUESS THAT MEANS HE HAS EVERY
RIGHT TO EXECUTE YOU.

112
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:31,149
>> THAT EXACT SITUATION HE DID
EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO.

113
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,749
HE TOLD THE GUY AS SOON AS HE

114
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:42,860
CAME UP.

115
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,389
THE COP UNLOADED LIKE A
BEAR WAS RUSHING HIM.

116
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,389
THINK

117
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:49,960
ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FEAR YOU

118
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,379
HAVE TO OPERATE WITH THAT YOU
ARE 2 FEET AWAY FROM A PERSON,

119
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,919
YOU HAVE A GUN POINTED AT THEIR

120
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:57,919
CHEST.

121
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,069
LET'S SAY THIS GUY
BELIEVED HE HAD A GUN.

122
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:02,069
HE

123
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:03,939
THOUGHT THIS GUY IS JUST GOING

124
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:10,639
TO GO FOR IT.

125
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,279
WHAT KIND OF
BIZARRE FICTIONAL WORLD DOES

126
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,749
THIS COP LIVE IN THAT HE THINKS
A PERSON WOULD TRY TO PULL A GUN

127
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:20,349
IN THAT SITUATION.

128
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:23,029
HE FIRES
SEVEN TIMES ALMOST POINT-BLANK.

129
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:26,349
ALSO KNOWING THAT THERE WERE
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CAR AND A

130
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:31,419
FOUR-YEAR-OLD IN THE
LINE OF FIRE.

131
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:36,740
>> IF HE WAS A WHITE RIGHT-WING
PATRIOT AND THE COPS EXECUTED

132
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,849
HIM, WHAT KIND OF FEAR HE WOULD

133
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,059
THERE BE ON THE RIGHT?

134
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,490
IMAGINE
IT WAS A BUNDY BOY?

135
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,770
THERE WOULD

136
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,479
BE NATIONAL PROTESTS.

137
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,169
>>WHAT EXCUSES THERE FURTHER TO
NOT BE.

138
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,169
NORMALLY THEY COME UP

139
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:57,789
WITH SOMETHING ñ THEY COMMITTED

140
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,849
A CRIME, THERE WAS A PROFILE ON
HIM.

141
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,419
IN THIS CASE THEY HAVE

142
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,770
NOTHING AND THEY STILL DON'T

143
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,770
CARE.

144
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,929
THEY EVEN KNOW HOW
HYPOCRITICAL IT LOOKS AND EVEN

145
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:12,910
THEN THEY CAN PRETEND TO CARE.

146
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,119
>>IF YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND
THEY STILL KILL YOU, THEN DON'T

147
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:22,580
BLACK PEOPLE HAVE SOME
JUSTIFIABLE REASON TO BE AFRAID

148
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,259
OF THE POLICE?

149
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,080
VIOLENCE DOESN'T
SOLVE VIOLENCE, IT MAKES IT

150
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,559
WORSE.

151
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,769
SHOULD YOU HAVE A
REASONABLE FEAR OF COPS IF YOU

152
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,260
ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN?

153
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,810
I MEAN
LOOK, AS FAR AS BLACK LIVES

154
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,140
MATTER, DO THEY MATTER?

155
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,630
THE MOST
GUTWRENCHING STUFF HAPPENED

156
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,800
AFTER THE SHOOTING.

157
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,790
THE FAMOUS
VIDEO THAT THE WOMAN IN A VIDEO

158
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,340
SHOT, WAS THE COP AFTER
SHOOTING HIM KEEPS POINTING THE

159
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,340
WEAPON AT HIM.

160
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,090
IT TAKES FOREVER
FOR THEM TO GET PHILANDO CASTILE

161
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:12,230
OUT OF THE CAR AND GET HIM HELP.

162
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:21,330
THEN THEY HANDCUFF HER.

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,330
LET'S

164
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,350
PUT THE RACIAL STUFF ASIDE AND
LET'S LOOK AT CLASS.

165
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,740
IF YOU JUST

166
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,930
SHOT THE MAYOR OF BEVERLY HILLS

167
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,080
AND THEN YOU HANDCUFF HIS WIFE ñ
YOU LET HIM BLEED OUT THEN HE

168
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,460
DIES AND THEN YOU HANDCUFF HIS

169
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,650
WIFE AND HAVE THE FOUR-YEAR-OLD
IN THE BACK THAT YOU DON'T GET ñ

170
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,490
THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE SO

171
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,490
OVERWHELMING.

172
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:54,070
AND 
HERE THERE ARE

173
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,750
NO CONSEQUENCES AT ALL.

174
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,750
SO

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,900
FINALLY WE GET TO ñ PHILANDO
CASTILE IS DEAD, HIS GIRLFRIEND

176
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:12,450
IS HANDCUFFED, THE IMMEDIATE
REACTION WAS OH MY GOD I

177
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,450
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT THIS GUY.

178
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,450
SOMEBODY HELP!

179
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,450
BUT HIS REACTION

180
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:29,780
IS COPS NEED TO BE SAFE- THEN I
MAKE SURE I TAKE THE PERSON WHO

181
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,160
HAS BEEN TERRIBLY TRAUMATIZED,

182
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,330
HANDCUFF THEM AND HAVE THEIR
FOUR-YEAR-OLD WATCHING.

183
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,330
THE

184
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,540
THINGS SHE SAID THAT BROOKE MY
HEART WAS, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO

185
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,030
GET SHOOTED."

186
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,290
COINCIDENTALLY I
HAVE A FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

187
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,210
THEY SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.

188
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,970
CAN
YOU IMAGINE IF YOUR DAUGHTER HAD

189
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,880
TO SAY THIS TO YOU?

190
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,030
SHE ALSO
SAYS I WISH THIS TOWN WAS SAFER.

191
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,550
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THE COPS.

192
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,160
SHE AT ONE POINT HUGGED HER MOM

193
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:21,600
AND SAID I CAN KEEP YOU SAFE.

194
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,480
AS
YOU'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN

195
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,080
THEY DON'T SEEM TO MATTER AS
MUCH AS OTHER PEOPLE IN THE

196
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
COUNTRY.

197
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:35,060
AND THE ONLY WAY SHE
CAN THINK OF TO KEEP HER MOM

198
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,980
SAFE WHEN SHE KEPT SAYING KEEP

199
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,500
YOUR HANDCUFFS ON.

200
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:47,510
BECAUSE IF
YOU'RE NOT HANDCUFFED AND YOU

201
00:11:47,510 --> 00:12:02,250
ARE 
A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA,

202
00:12:02,250 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU ARE NOT SAFE.
