Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign or as it's known for short among her friends the cesspool of hellacious corruption and dishonesty bent on elevating a desiccated soulless hag to the highest office in the land I can't tell you what our enemies call it but in any case the campaign has been searching for a response to FBI director James Comey zz announcement that he's investigating a new catch of Hillary's emails while at a beauty salon preparing for her next appearance Hillary Clinton said she wanted to send this message to Comey I was too much to handle but before the campaign settled on that response they rejected a number of other suggestions and today projects clava toss a 501c3 nonprofit charitable corporation designed to funnel money into my personal offshore account has recovered those suggested responses here's the list of Clinton responses to the latest scandal that were rejected by her campaign number one claim that this investigation is part of the same vast right-wing conspiracy that falsely accused Bill Clinton of having an affair with an intern in the Oval Office number two run screaming through the streets look behind you Donald Trump is coming run for your life then shriek loudly in hopes of causing a panic number three admit that you made a mistake in using a private server but point out that you only did it to hide your other illegal activities number four admit that you've been a naughty girl in a sultry seductive voice and then hiked up the hem of your pants suit and say but how'd you like a piece of this action huh big boy you can see why they rejected some of these five point out that after centuries of American men oppressing women by working to support them in their children the only way these men can properly atone for their crimes is by electing a lesbian president number six point out that uma Abbadon were for a radical Islamic magazine and has ties to the Islamic Brotherhood and therefore anyone who has a problem with Hillary's classified emails appearing on her computer is clearly Islamophobic number seven point out that America's economy is suffering her wars overseas are getting worse and corruption has run rampant through the highest levels of government and therefore the legacy of Barack Obama must be preserved number eight shame Donald Trump for saying he can get away with molesting women just because he's a celebrity by producing women who claim he molested them but they never said anything about it because he's a celebrity number nine tell the public that the presidency is yours by right and anyone who stands in your way is gonna get it in the neck big time believe you me and number ten confess to your crimes beg for forgiveness resigned from the presidential race because America deserves better get a reality TV show become a star then run for president trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show you never get this long out of your worm to end all your worms

put it up he shows up dressed in a short Pocahontas skirt wearing a blonde wig because he's Elizabeth Warren so he's not only culturally he's not only culturally appropriating the Indians he's here let's see if we get a he's not only culturally appropriating the Indians he's culturally appropriating somebody who's culturally appropriating the Indians we get it all right and that on top that was on top of of course Shapiro putting up his thug Thug like thing with Taylor poor tailor our beautiful makeup ladies on the back and now everybody on my Twitter fee did you put it on that you can't get that out of your head right now everybody on my Twitter view is making these obscene remarks about how lovely Taylor is because my followers are like 12 year old kids you know it's flattering but have a little ghost a little bit of glass that's all I ask all right absolute polarity is ensuing in this political season I have to say in the wake of Comey you know coming up with these emails remember remember Clavin second rule of MSM journalism right if the scandal is on the right the story is the scandal if the scandal is on the left the story is what kind of rotten guy got this scandal and what kind of illegal ways so it's all Comey hears from News Buster's ever since it was announced on Friday that the FBI was pursuing new leads into the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server scandal the big three networks ABC CBS and NBC have gone into attack mode against James Comey turning what should be a scandal about Clinton into a smear against the FBI director this is cliff Clavin do you have that chart did you get that chart I sent this or like this this is much of the coverage is about Comey and how much of it is about Hillary Clinton beginning on with the evening of the announcement through Monday morning Mr CS Media Research Council analysts what's that santur Media Resources Center analysts reviewed all statements by reporters analysts and partisans that took a position on Comey and Clinton and found arguments against Comey swamped those against Clinton by a ratio of almost 300 won the New York Times is is going insane in real-time it's like it's like journalism dying as you watch it like you just you open the New York Times many people don't know this it used to be a newspaper used to be a newspaper and you pick it up here's here's their story on Trump today Donald Trump used legally dubious method to avoid paying taxes the translation of that is Donald Trump used legal methods to avoid paying taxes it's like you know and that's and we're supposed to care about this and says this method was so legally dubious that the law that allowed it was repealed many years later this is their news story the other one of course is that the investigation into the connections between his campaign and Russia have come up with nothing all right so this is let's let's hear Hillary this is how Hillary is pushing it why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing that's a good question and first of all for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email I understand and as I've said I'm not making excuses I've said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means they shouldn't look at them and I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they look at my emails for the last year there is so-so morning Joe put out this compilation about how the Democrats reacted to Comey after he didn't indict her cuz I that's that's her big argument right that is basically her campaign slogan vote for me I'm unindicted right so when we didn't indict her this was the reaction among Democrats and tough career public servant Jim call me is somebody with the highest standards of integrity I think director Comey could not have been more exhaustive I am grateful for the professionalism of the FBI and the Department of Justice this is a great man we are very privileged in our country to have him be the director of the FBI no one can question the integrity the competence I don't know whether your family's watching this but I hope that they are as proud of you we are so proud of your Jim God it's like we feel like your parents were so proud of you and that love that Harry Reid is and there Harry Reid is now on the floor of the Senate accusing him of violating the Hatch Act which forbids any employee of the federal agency of interfering with elections Reid who's he not only is he slime he's cowardly slime because when he's speaking that on the floor of the Senate you can't be sued that's why he was always demonizing the Koch brothers the Koch brothers just these guys who believe in free enterprise who contribute to candidates who support free enterprise not not like George Soros like this guy in his Tower like the guy what's the who's the evil guy from Lord of the Rings you know isn't it his dour plotting in the you know to control the whole world you know the Koch brothers are given a little money to their case and he's demonizing but always on the Senate floor so he can't get sued he's such a slime the president meanwhile isn't playing he's forget about this Josh Ernst the president's spokesman the president's assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed for example the president doesn't believe that director Comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election the president doesn't believe that he's secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party he's in a tough spot you see I believe this for a long time a lot of people who afraid that Obama is gonna like pardon Hillary or something that's possible vaguely possible that if she gets elected he might do something like that to you know keep the investigators off her case but in in Barack Obama's mind Barack Obama is the greatest president who ever lived there's Barack Obama and then maybe Lincoln and that this isn't Barack Obama's money there is no he hates this woman he thinks she's dirty because Obama is not dirty in the way she is he's not money dirty the way she is there's no way he's sacrificing his legacy to get her off the hook I mean then he's just Gerald Ford he's just this guy who like let somebody got somebody off the hook he's a machine Paul and everything she does after that is on him you know and I don't think I don't think Obama's gonna go there I don't think it's gonna go so meanwhile I just have to play so a little bit more of this because some of it is so funny James Carville goes on to you listen absolutely not serious he was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans in the story I think I'd lend to him they gave it to Fox News also we have an extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from from the Clinton campaign that they hacked so we American democracy is really under attack here and the question is how are we and particularly how Democrats going to respond to this and we have to understand this is really really quite extraordinary and it would seem to me that the FBI shouldn't be getting wronged by the House Republicans that if that's it that's what happened yes and there's nothing else that's going on and at meantime we do know that our democracy is under so by the KGB I mean to me that's something we ought to be talking about that's a very pertinent relevant issue in this campaign and people have to decide do we want do we want our country for ourselves and people in charge oh we're gonna let the KGB and the House Republicans decide this election I love it because the KGB is in line with the Republicans who are in line with Fox News who are like yeah that's like it's a massive block and and and that's not even the best one that my favorite here's my favorite is from Robin Lake off professor of linguistics writing in Time magazine you can't I'm not making it you know what I got to say goodbye if you're on Facebook and YouTube but you can come over to the Daily wire and hear the rest and you should subscribe and send in questions for the mailbag tomorrow you
