thing one tonight a spectacle in Pennsylvania as Republicans try to have it both ways in the special election there they are desperate to downplay expectations today the Pennsylvania GOP Chairman called the district they're a Democrat district it's democratic district technically but even though Romney wanted by 17 points and Trump wanted by a whopping 20 but the congressional race is becoming such a symbolic prize that millions of dollars are being spent even though the district will be redrawn by the midterm elections eight months from now President Trump rally there and now on the eve of the election they sent in the closer Donald Trump jr. hair net and all who brought his own special campaigning touch and lots of sugar that's thing too in 60 seconds the stakes couldn't be lower for the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th which will be redrawn by midterm elections just eight months from now but Donald Trump jr. campaigned there today taking a torrent of candy factory hair nets required and spawning memes such as if it's what you say I love it maybe later in the spring Don jr. also held an impromptu news conference along with a replicant candidate Rex a cone and a big bowl of ice cream I had a coal miner down a rally down in Greene County just the other day production is way up so I don't know where you're getting that and that's the that's the forecast I have for : mr.
