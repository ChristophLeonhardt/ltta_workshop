1
00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:08,393
â™ª

2
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:09,895
>> IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE

3
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:11,797
ARE BEING ASKED TO TRUST THE

4
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:13,031
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHO WE

5
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:15,834
KNOW DID, IN FACT, USE A LAW

6
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,102
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SPY BUT

7
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:18,704
LIED TO GET THE WARRANTS.

8
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:20,339
LIED TO A FEDERAL JUDGE

9
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:21,907
UNDER THE FISA ACT.

10
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:24,276
MAKE NO BONES ABOUT IT, A

11
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:25,811
FISA WARRANT IS, IN FACT, A

12
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:27,079
LICENSE TO SPY.

13
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,081
NOW, THE QUESTION IS:  DID

14
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,916
YOU LIE, CHEAT, OR STEAL IN

15
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,017
ORDER TO DO THAT?

16
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:33,552
THEY DID MISLEAD THE JUDGE,

17
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:36,522
GET A WARRANT, MULTIPLE, YOU

18
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:39,525
KNOW, ABILITY TO SPY, AND

19
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:41,026
NOW WE'RE ASKED TO BELIEVE

20
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:42,261
THAT YOU CAN TRUST THE VERY

21
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,529
PEOPLE WHO KNOW THIS AND ARE

22
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,731
COVERING IT UP.

23
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:47,666
STEVE: THERE YOU'VE GOT

24
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,600
DARRELL ISSA YESTERDAY ON

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,635
ONE OF THE SUNDAY SHOWS

26
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,435
TALKING ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT

27
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:51,570
OF JUSTICE AND THE

28
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,204
REPUBLICAN'S INVESTIGATION

29
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:53,939
THEY WANT A WHOLE BUNCH OF

30
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:54,506
DOCUMENTS THEY ARE NOT

31
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:55,040
GETTING THEM.

32
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,108
THE DOJ SAYS THEY ARE

33
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:56,942
PROVIDING THEM.

34
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:58,810
LET'S BRING IN DAN BONGINO.

35
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,646
HE HAS A LOT OF SOURCES ON

36
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:02,147
THIS FORMER NEW YORK CITY

37
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,248
POLICE OFFICERS.

38
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:04,081
SECRET SERVICE GUY.

39
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:05,316
HOST OF THE DAN BONGINO

40
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:05,651
SHOW.

00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:06,685
THANKS FOR JOINING US FROM

42
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:07,186
FLORIDA TODAY.

43
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:08,720
YOU KNOW, FORT END OF THE

44
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,322
WEEK WE STARTED TO HEAR

45
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:13,025
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

46
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:14,359
THAT THE REPUBLICANS GET ALL

47
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,627
THE DOCUMENTS REGARDING THIS

48
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:16,528
SECRET INTEL SOURCE.

49
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:18,764
THEY ALMOST REGARD THAT

50
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,199
INFORMATION AS IMPORTANT AS

51
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:22,601
THE WHOLE RUSSIA DOSSIER.

52
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:23,268
>> RIGHT.

53
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:26,471
AND THERE'S A REASON, STEVE.

54
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:28,106
LISTEN, I'VE SPENT NEARLY 20

55
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:29,374
YEARS OF MY LIFE AS A COP

56
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:30,275
AND FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR.

57
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:32,211
I HAVE NEVER, IN MY LIFE,

58
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:33,912
SEEN SUCH AN OBVIOUS FRAME

59
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:34,947
JOB AND SETUP.

60
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:36,215
THIS WAS A STING OPERATION

61
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,115
AGAINST THE TRUMP TEAM.

62
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:38,350
THAT IS WHY IT'S CRITICAL

63
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,385
THAT THEY HIDE THE SOURCE.

64
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:41,220
WHY IS IT CRITICAL THAT THEY

65
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,588
HIDE THE SOURCE, STEVE?

66
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:43,488
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD

67
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:45,057
THE ENTIRE TIME BY THE HACKS

68
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:46,792
IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA,

69
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:47,893
DEMOCRATS AND SOME

70
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:48,527
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS

71
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:50,429
THAT THE CASE AGAINST TRUMP

72
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,364
WAS JUST A SERIES OF

73
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:53,065
ACCIDENTAL CONTACTS WHERE

74
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,399
THEY RAN INTO THE TRUMP TEAM

75
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,567
AND THEY SAID STUFF.

76
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:57,803
BUT, STEVE, LET ME ASK YOU

77
00:01:57,803 --> 00:01:59,771
THIS, WHAT IF THOSE CONTACTS

78
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:00,806
WERE DELIBERATE THAT THROWS

79
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:02,841
THIS WHOLE STORY OUT THE

80
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:03,175
WINDOW?

81
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,643
I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS,

82
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:05,844
SO HAVE MANY OTHER PEOPLE.

83
00:02:05,844 --> 00:02:07,846
THESE WERE DELIBERATE

84
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:08,280
CONTACTS.

85
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,947
BRIAN: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

86
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:09,615
MEAN BY THAT I DON'T KNOW

87
00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:10,916
WHAT YOU MEAN DELIBERATE

88
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:11,250
CONTACT?

89
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,317
PEOPLE SET UP THERE TO SET

90
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:14,519
UP PEOPLE ON THE TRUMP TEAM,

91
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:15,854
SET UP THIS INTERACTION AND

92
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:17,522
MAKE IT LOOK TERRIBLE?

93
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:19,391
>> YES!

94
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:19,825
EXACTLY.

95
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:20,993
BRIAN, IT'S LIKE I WIND UP

96
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:22,194
ON A PARK BENCH WITH YOU AND

97
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:23,662
ASK YOU TO ROB A BANK WITH

98
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:25,097
ME AND HAVE YOU NEVER MET ME

99
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:25,430
BEFORE.

100
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,332
YOU ARE LIKE WHO IS THIS

101
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:27,599
GUY?

102
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,967
THERE IS ONLY TWO POSSIBLE

103
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:29,401
EXPLANATIONS.

104
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,302
EITHER YOU REALLY WANT ME TO

105
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:31,803
ROB A BANK WITH YOU OR I'M

106
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:34,506
TRYING TO ROB

107
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:34,539
TRYING TO FOB

108
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:35,540
TRYING TO FRAME YOU FOR

109
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,375
ROBBING THE BANK.

110
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,977
I WOULD SAY IT'S THE LATTER

111
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:39,378
WITH TRUMP.

112
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:40,979
>> THEY SAY THERE WAS A

113
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,114
SOURCE EMBEDDED IN THE TRUMP

114
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:43,715
TEAM THAT PROVIDED A LOT OF

115
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:44,650
INFORMATION TO GLENN SIMPSON

116
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,351
AND THE DOSSIER CREW, RIGHT?

117
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:50,989
>> BRIAN, SIMPSON'S ALREADY

118
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:51,823
ADMITTED IN SWORN TESTIMONY

119
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:52,924
IN THE SENATE THAT THE FBI

120
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:53,759
TOLD CHRISTOPHER STEELE THEY

121
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,793
HAD A SOURCE IN THE

122
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:55,160
CAMPAIGN.

123
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,561
NONE OF THIS IS NEW NEWS.

124
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:57,963
AND BY THE WAY THE LIST OF

125
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,531
SUBJECTS FOR THAT SOURCE OR

126
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,099
SUSPECTS IS VERY SHORT.

127
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,968
AND VERY DISTURBING.

128
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:03,669
STEVE: SOUNDS LIKE ACCORDING

129
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,103
TO WHAT WE HAVE READ, THE

130
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,372
SOURCE WAS NOT FEEDING

131
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:08,206
THINGS TO THE FUSION.

132
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:09,308
THE SOURCE WAS ACTUALLY

133
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:10,575
FEEDING IT DIRECTLY TO THE

134
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:13,078
FBI.

135
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,013
>> AND WHEN WE FIND OUT HOT

136
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:16,548
SOURCE IS, I THINK SOME

137
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:17,349
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS

138
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,117
ARE GOING IT BE A LITTLE

139
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,485
WORRIED, TOO U THIS WAS A

140
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:21,386
SWAMP OPERATION.

141
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:23,855
THIS WASN'T JUST DEMOCRATS.

142
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:24,556
AINSLEY: WE WANT TO SHOW YOU

143
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:25,023
THIS INTERVIEW.

144
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:25,957
IT WAS BERNIE SANDERS, HE

145
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,260
WAS ON WITH JAKE TAPPER.

146
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,696
JAKE WAS ASKING WHY DO YOU

147
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:31,563
SUPPORT -- WHY DID YOU

148
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:33,131
SUPPORT JOHN BRENNAN FOR CIA

149
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,366
DIRECTOR AND THEN YOU DON'T

150
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,635
WHEN HE WAS GINA HASPEL'S

151
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:36,935
BOSS.

152
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,437
BUT WHY DON'T YOU SUPPORT

153
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:39,504
GINA HASPEL WHEN THEY WERE

154
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:40,839
DOING THE SAME THING RIGHT

155
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,540
AFTER 9/11?

156
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,607
LISTEN TO THIS.

157
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:49,881
>> WHY IS BRENNAN OKAY BUT

158
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:50,782
GINA HASPEL IS NOT.

159
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:52,617
>> IF THE UNITED STATES

160
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:53,685
CONDONES TORTURE FOR OTHER

161
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:54,986
PEOPLE, THEN THAT SUBJECTS

162
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,188
OUR OWN MEN AND WOMEN WHO

163
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:58,457
WERE CAPTURED TO BE TORTURED

164
00:03:58,457 --> 00:03:59,057
AS WELL.

165
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:01,059
I THINK BRENNAN DID A GOOD

166
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:02,594
JOB IN HIS POSITION.

167
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,764
I HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS

168
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:06,665
ABOUT THIS NOMINEE.

169
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,467
>> YOU DIDN'T HAVE

170
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:09,434
RESERVATIONS ABOUT JOHN

171
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:09,768
BRENNAN.

172
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:12,304
YOU VOTED FOR JOHN BRENNAN.

173
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:13,872
>> IT GOES DEEPER THAN THAT

174
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:14,973
AND THAT IS THE FOREIGN

175
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:17,909
POLICY THAT WE HAVE SEEN

176
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,211
FROM MR. TRUMP, SOMETHING

177
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,644
THAT I ALSO STRONGLY

178
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,614
DISAGREE WITH.

179
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:23,315
BRIAN: SO BECAUSE IT'S

180
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:24,983
DONALD TRUMP.

181
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:25,784
>> YEAH.

182
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:27,452
GUYS, IT DOESN'T GO --

183
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,454
BERNIE SAYS WELL, IT GOES

184
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:30,689
DEEPER THAN THAT IT DOESN'T

185
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:31,790
GO DEEPER THAN THAT.

186
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,759
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT'S

187
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,160
GOING ON FROM A GUY WHO HAS

188
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,329
RUN FOR OFFICE BEFORE.

189
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,530
THE DEMOCRATIC BASE HAS

190
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,031
BLOOD FROM ITS FANGS FOR

191
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:40,465
TRUMP.

192
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:41,767
THEY CAN'T STAND HIM.

193
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,935
THEY WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE

194
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:45,203
ON THERE WITH A D IN FRONT

195
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:47,372
OF THEIR NAME, ANYONE TO DO

196
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,273
ANYTHING PRO-TRUMP EVER.

197
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:49,975
EVEN IF IT VIOLATES

198
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:50,675
PRINCIPLES THEY HAVE HAD IN

199
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:51,243
THE PAST.

200
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:52,477
LOOK AT THE TAX CUT THING.

201
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:53,478
THE ARGUMENT THEY MADE ABOUT

202
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:54,813
THE TAX CUT THING NANCY

203
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:56,114
PELOSI JUST CRUMBS.

204
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:56,715
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

205
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:58,450
I THOUGHT YOU HATED TAX CUTS

206
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,685
AND NOW YOU WANT THEM TO BE

207
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:01,019
BIGGER?

208
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,155
COMPLETE HYPOCRITES ON THIS

209
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:03,522
STUFF.

210
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:04,623
BRIAN: WE DON'T KNOW HOW

211
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:06,491
HASPEL IS GOING TO GO.

212
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,193
PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC.

213
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:09,928
SLEEPY JOE DONNELLY SAYS HE

214
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:10,328
WOULD DO IT.

215
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:11,797
JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WOULD DO

216
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:12,364
IT.

217
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:13,899
OBVIOUSLY JOHN MCCAIN ISN'T

218
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,233
GOING TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT

219
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:15,500
IT.

220
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,635
WE KNOW JEFF FLAKE IS

221
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:17,769
CONSIDERING NOT DOING IT.

222
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:19,070
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT RAND

223
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,338
PAUL IS GOING TO DO.

224
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:21,807
BUT THEY DO THINK THAT MORE

225
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:22,941
DEMOCRATS WILL END UP

226
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:24,109
PUTTING HER OVER THE TOP,

227
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:25,477
JUST BARELY.

228
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:27,979
>> WELL, AT LEAST RAND PAUL

229
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,880
IS PRINCIPLED ON IT.

230
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,881
THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING IT

231
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:31,750
JUST TO GET REELECTED.

232
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,251
YOU MAY SEE HEITCAMP AS

233
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:33,552
WELL.

234
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:34,920
YOU WILL SEE A COUPLE MORE.

235
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,620
THIS IS A TOUGH FIGHT FOR

236
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,488
THE DEMOCRATS TO GET

237
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:37,289
INVOLVED IN.

238
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:38,523
AFTER 9/11 WAS A FAR

239
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:39,458
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT.

240
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,926
AND JUDGING IT NOW BY THOSE

241
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:43,528
STANDARDS IS KIND OF

242
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:43,962
HYPOCRITICAL.

243
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:44,529
>> I THINK.

244
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:45,931
SO OBVIOUSLY THE ONLY REASON

245
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:46,765
THEY ARE DOING THAT BECAUSE

246
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:48,066
THEY ARE IN RED STATES AND

247
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,067
THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST

248
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,435
VOTES THEY HAVE TO SHOW THEY

249
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,136
WERE ACTUALLY WITH DONALD

250
00:05:51,136 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUMP AS THEY RUN FOR
