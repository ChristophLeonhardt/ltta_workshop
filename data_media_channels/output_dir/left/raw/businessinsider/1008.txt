1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,469
probably the the thing that's mattered

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,550
most for me was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I did by</font>

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,700
accident<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some number of</font>

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim Urban who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> writes the wait</font>

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">but why blog he posted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he had taken</font>

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the typing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test and I was like this is</font>

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">so interesting I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would never thought to</font>

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,870
assess my typing speed maybe we did that

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,820
in middle school but had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it forgot about</font>

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,090
it

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,820
I took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I found out that I type at</font>

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,650
a rate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me highly qualified to</font>

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,930
be an administrative assistant<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like</font>

14
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,720
okay you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> university tenure goes</font>

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,170
away that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good backup plan but</font>

16
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,120
I've actually learned that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,980
investing real time and practicing

18
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,110
typing more quickly has made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

19
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,300
more productive<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a writer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assuming I</font>

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,800
know what I want to say right if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,780
write a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> more words you know per</font>

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,120
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before then I</font>

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
generate a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those ideas and</font>

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know throw more of them away but</font>

25
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll also have more to keep and I think</font>

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,899
until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point where voice</font>

27
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,550
recognition technology just<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes typing</font>

28
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,320
obsolete<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think like spending</font>

29
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,420
a couple hours a week for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few weeks</font>

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,890
improving your typing speed is a great

31
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,760
way to be more productive

00:01:00,760 --> 00:00:00,000
