Chameleons are known
for changing color.
But their powers are
more than just skin-deep.
They fire their tongues out
to capture insects to eat.
And those are some tongues —
usually about
two times body length.
Now, a scientist
at Brown University
has found that the
smallest chameleons
pack an extra punch.
This is Rhampholeon spinosus.
It’s just under
2 inches long.
Its tongue shoots
out to about
two and a half times
that body length
and accelerates so fast,
it’s pulling about 264 Gs.
That acceleration
and the power output
of 14,000 watts per kilogram,
top any known movement
by any reptile,
bird or mammal.
The researchers found that the
smaller chameleons in general
packed a bigger punch.
The reason seems to be
that smaller animals tend
to have higher
metabolisms, so they
need to eat more per pound,
or per fraction of an ounce.
To do that, these
chameleons evolved
an oversized, souped-up
feeding mechanism.
Apparently, power
to the little
is an evolutionary maxim.
