welcome back everybody joining us some Washington with a look at Axios a.m. national political reporter for Axios Jonathan Swan Jonathan good to talk to you once again this morning what's Axios is one big thing for this morning we take you inside the Oval Office to explain why Trump wants to take on Amazon not Facebook the biggest business story in America today is that Washington wants Facebook's blood but the guy who actually sits in the Oval Office President Trump he's not interested we spoke to sources who've discussed these issues with the president he never brings up Facebook he never talks about Mark Zuckerberg but he is obsessed that is a direct quote obsessed with Amazon he's amused he's wondered aloud about using antitrust or competition law to go after Amazon he's talked about changing their tax treatments and it's this sort of ideas he floats continually in meetings but they actually haven't resulted in any plan yet why is the president obsessed with Amazon and Jeff Bezos what's at the root of all this lots of different things but he's real OTT of his wealthy friends particularly his real estate buddies tell him that Amazon is putting them out of business that it's killing bricks and mortar retailers and shopping malls and he's really got that into his head he believes that another thing that he repeats again and again and again in meetings private meetings is that he believes that US taxpayers and the US Postal Service have been subsidizing Amazon he believes that they're getting a free ride off the Postal Service he sort of flicked at that in a tweet in December where people were confused about what he meant by this tweet saying that they should charge and they should charge Amazon more but a source told me that it's been explained to him multiple times that actually the post office makes quite a lot of money off Amazon and that's it's not true but he's again he's internalized this idea and believes it he just won't let it go is there any real action that the president could take to sort of crackdown as he wants to do it seems on Amazon well there of course there are hypothetical actions but there is nothing in the works or or in planning another thing I should say is that the personal elements of this which is Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon he views and obviously Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post which Trump views as business's political weapon so part of this is also wanting to clip bees AUSA's wings that's what sources have spoken to the president say anyway so your sources are also telling you that despite this sort of data scandal engulfing Facebook right now in Cameron's analytic oh and all that it's not really on the president's radar why why is that does he feel like if he mentions camera did a Linda Claire Facebook it kind of deal Ajith amaizing the 2016 election also legitimizes the Bob Muller investigation in Russia I can't speak to that level of what he feels but certainly the perception of sources who speak to him who say he just never brings it up is twofold one is that he believes the whole Russia investigation is a hoax that's his words the second is that he just doesn't really understand the issues at play he's not tuned into the whole debate over data and information and really he is I mean my colleague one of axes founders Jim VandeHei wrote a piece describing Trump as a 1950's man and in many ways he is he sees industry in those terms he sees you know the smokestacks and the heavy industry and you know the bricks and mortar retailers groceries physical mail delivery and those are exactly the industries that Amazon is going after and Amazon is disrupting more than Facebook so it actually stands to reason that he sees Amazon as more of a threat to the America that he understands all right so the president's not really interested in Facebook our cameras analytical at that but Facebook not really out of the woods quite yet what's going on there what other thing that we reveal in this piece that's coming in Mike gallons newsletter is that the Vice President Mike Pence is concerned with Facebook and Google and he believes that they've become dangerously powerful almost monopolistic with control over the media how the media coverage covers I am issues how the advertising industry and over people's data it's been described to me by a source was direct knowledge that when people have raised the idea of ding up Facebook and Google he's listened with a very open mind so I think that he hasn't I'm told he hasn't pushed to any of this in meetings yet he's not pursuing any specific policy yet but I will also stress the word yet all right Jonathan Swan thank you will be reading actually of Sam in just a little while and to all of our viewers out there you
