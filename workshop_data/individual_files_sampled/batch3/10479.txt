I think Irish people are known worldwide for their hospitality and it's time to step up and engage with people whose lives have been completely affected by the war and also for the government to put the call out for people to engage in this way as well I don't have a spare bed myself but it is something I do a lot of work with asylum seekers and refugees and well a year is a long time I think if you're being asked to provide obviously room board and maybe money I don't know and so maybe a lot of people might find that a year is quite a long time and given the fact that as you just said is we have a housing crisis and not that I was like to have our own first and I think each case should be done on its merits but I think that might find a knock serve a great response here especially in Dublin I think it's very good idea very good idea it would be a one that'll be appeal to me anyway definitely yeah I think so yeah though we should have a second chance to get out of there a war-torn country or something that so definitely it would be a good idea absolutely I think it's really positive and at the moment that my own housing situation is bit up in the air but yeah it definitely would be something that I think it's very positive whenever definitely be done yet my biggest problems with the homeless here we're not looking after them yes but if people can help yeah please do
