what a Taylor Swift you that really angered Amy Zimmerman over at The Daily Beast the pop superstar endorsed the women's March in a simple tweet but after staying remarkably silent during the election many sought his opportunism and far too little far too late so she didn't show up to this idiot woman's March with this with Ashley Judd and Lena Dunham and Madonna all screaming about their vajayjays instead of doing that she just sent out a tweet and her tweet basically just said that she was proud of the people who were marching and said so much love pride and respect for those who March I'm proud to be a woman today and everyday hashtag women's March okay pretty bland right pretty bland stuff but this according to Amy Zimmerman makes her a villainous she's a bad person why because she didn't use the power of her celebrity or Ana cramdown radical political views about vaginas and their inherent values as is making you a complete human being the piece itself is totally crazy it says with all of the pink posturing on display last weekend conversation naturally turned toward Taylor Swift our nation's most opportunistic celebrity Taylor has an unrivaled ability to read the room in seize a moment but strangely enough Swift has no interest in leaning in to her true potential instead she's resolutely tried to preserve her public images the sweet romantic girl next door question why does Amy Zimmerman I thought that this idea of the women's March was female autonomy why does she get to determine what Swift's true potential is I didn't realize the Taylor Swift's true potential was being a public politician it turned out that her true potential was in making overrated pop songs and that was her true potential and she's fulfilled that she's eighty two point three million Twitter followers and she's one of the richest people on planet earth so she's done fine in maximizing her true potential but the left worship celebrity to the extent that they think that if you are celebrity you should therefore be a leader and if you abdicate political leadership therefore you are a member of the bad guys you remember the bad guys this is a pretty amazing statement this what Zimmermann writes is a pretty white girl who has written songs that rely heavily on fiddles Swift undoubtedly counts a healthy handful of Trump supporters among her fanbase right that's like 50% of the country Taylor Swift has all used always valued a politicize 'im even to a fault her girl squad has been infamously silent on social issues there's a crave and calculus to winning brownie points without offending your most offensive fans cutesy sentiments and political palatability are no longer acceptable if you're not overtly onboard with resistance you're tacitly chill with being proclaimed in Aryan goddess trying or pretending to be woke without displaying any sort of political preference or informed opinion is almost more offensive than saying nothing at all almost more offensive but if she'd said nothing then you would've been shit about it wouldn't you so the idea is that if you don't overtly endorse the women's March you are therefore an enemy of women everywhere and you're on board with not just Donald Trump but Donald from its most extreme supporters the peppy people who think that she's an Aryan goddess and this is the routine that a lot of these senem or online trolls have been pushing what utter stupidity what ideological fascism taylor swift is a fully autonomous woman she can do whatever she wants with her politics I don't have to like her music to understand that she has the same rights that Amy Zimmerman does on her politics and the idea that you are going to browbeat her because she is famous for playing songs on a guitar into endorsing your stupid March is just a monster of how radical the left has become and how polarized they have made politics its ideological fascism in action the idea if you don't fall in with Lena Dunham you're in league with Richard Spencer is just pure idiocy and it's demagoguery of the highest sort look what you've made me do leftist defend Taylor Swift damn you
