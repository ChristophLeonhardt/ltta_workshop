1
00:00:00,327 --> 00:00:01,660
My name is
Baltasar Kormakur.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,180
I’m the director of "Adrift."

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,610
So now we see Shailene and
Sam playing Tami and Richard.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,140
There — she’s dragging him.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,220
He’s not as
courageous as she is.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,680
She’s more like an
outgoing person.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,740
He’s more like an
English gentleman.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,310
And they recently met.

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,600
And they’re kind
of falling in love.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,550
He’s excited about her
outgoingness and wildness.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,740
We start with a crane here.

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,880
And there she jumps.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,260
You know the
camera follows her.

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,725
We come up on Sam.

15
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,285
Tami!

16
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:39,019
And we hand over the camera
from a crane to a handheld.

17
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:40,810
And now we have a
handheld camera operator.

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,120
He’s trying to be
as steady as he can.

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,790
And then, whoop!

20
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,540
And he goes up with him
and bang into the water.

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,230
So I wanted to give the
audience the jump as well,

22
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,620
not only the actors.

23
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,890
And here we stay and
he’s looking for her

24
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,350
as he doesn’t know,
you know, maybe she

25
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,650
hurt herself when she
jumped down or something,

26
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,830
hit the bottom.

27
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,370
So he goes down
to look for her.

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,860
And she is just
pulling his tail

29
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,380
having a little meditation.

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,950
And here she has a rock
around her legs

31
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,241
because if not, she would
just be floating down the river.

32
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:12,620
There was a lot
of stream there.

33
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,310
And now we have
three moving elements

34
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,460
in the water, the camera
who is circling around them

35
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,310
and they’re circling around.

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,090
And by doing
this, I was hoping

37
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,930
to put you more into the
perspective of the actor

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,402
and give you the feeling of
being in the water with them

39
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:30,110
instead of just making
beauty shots

40
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,470
around them.

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,246
And you know, you see partly
the beautiful environment.

42
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:37,370
Like when I watch something
like that, I’m curious.

43
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,170
Where are they?

44
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,770
Where are these
rocks, you know?

45
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,660
It becomes more
interesting to me.

46
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,980
And it was actually quite
a tricky one to get.

47
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,780
We had to draft down
this river after driving

48
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,620
for hours up there.

49
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,500
It’s high up in the
mountains in Fiji

50
00:01:51,500 --> 00:00:00,000
and the rocks around
there are so unique.
