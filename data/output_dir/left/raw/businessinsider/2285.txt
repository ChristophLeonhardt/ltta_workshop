00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,340
Google Maps is huge and they're in this

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,080
space now and there are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,969
location-based apps launched all the

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,070
time how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hops not fighting these</font>

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,559
behemoths competitors to tell you the

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">truth in terms of what we do which is</font>

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,690
get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from point A to point B</font>

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,190
through a combination of walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mass</font>

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,660
transit directions there's really only

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,699
one other company that is doing that and

11
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,119
it's google right through google transit

12
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,150
no none of the other location-based

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,550
services or companies that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of</font>

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">are providing that user experience in</font>

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that service that said you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know Google's</font>

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,409
of the company and we have a challenge

17
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of us in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to</font>

18
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,409
differentiate ourselves versus the

19
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:47,000
behemoth there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I've always</font>

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to know how do you keep track of</font>

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,519
changes in the transit system yeah it's

22
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,750
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great question at the end of the day</font>

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're data company we're data aggregator</font>

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> data normalizer so we source data</font>

25
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,220
from the hundreds of different transit

26
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,260
agencies throughout the country we're

27
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,110
now actually in 17 cities not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> New</font>

28
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,420
York so within any one city there's

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,609
numerous transit agencies i think in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New</font>

30
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">York there's over 30 trip different</font>

31
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,380
transit agencies not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> MTA so we need</font>

32
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,079
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are sourcing the</font>

33
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,049
most current<font color="#E5E5E5"> and accurate data from them</font>

34
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,689
and are staying<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of any changes</font>

35
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are happening in real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time out on</font>

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the railways and on the roadways which</font>

37
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,009
we do that through both structured data

38
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,780
feeds as well as unstructured data fit

39
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,149
so you get you get regular updates so we

40
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:39,710
do get regular updates from the transit

41
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,240
agencies but then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sense</font>

42
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those updates and ingest them into</font>

43
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:44,899
our routing engine and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

44
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:47,450
what's most important the end user sees

45
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,789
those updates and gets rerouted in real

46
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,350
time based on what's happening out there

47
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,759
on the tracks so you make your money

48
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">from advertising we are largely ad</font>

49
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">supported but we also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

50
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,630
service revenue as well best way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about that is our user experience</font>

52
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,939
embedded on other media and publisher

53
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,880
sites to help their users get from point

54
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,280
A to point B in the same way we help<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

55
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,340
users get from pointed

56
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are you profitable we are currently</font>

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,540
profitable you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Foursquare and</font>

58
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">what Facebook is going to have check-ins</font>

59
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,430
what's your take on all this and is it

60
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,989
something that hop stops going to look

61
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,239
at as well so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the growth and</font>

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,400
local growth in mobile the growth in

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,069
location-based services is great it's a

64
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,709
huge market it's still somewhat untapped

65
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,370
it's still somewhat uncracked and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

66
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">think companies like foursquare and</font>

67
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,410
gowalla and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hopstop or proving that</font>

68
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,120
helping people in their everyday lives

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,930
in their local communities is very

70
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">valuable we do what we do well</font>

71
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,730
Foursquare does what it does well I

72
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,709
could definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a relationship</font>

73
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,569
between those two<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies in terms of</font>

74
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,390
the services that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we provide being</font>

75
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,489
married together but all in good time

76
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,379
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> compete with Google Maps</font>

77
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,420
getting installed on every<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone yeah</font>

78
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,760
we it's it's challenging I mean google

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,560
is pervasively distributed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhones</font>

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,629
that said that's just one form of

81
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,130
interfacing with your users from a

82
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,260
mobile perspective we not only have an

83
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,450
iphone app we obviously have a website

84
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,790
to a mobile enabled site and then we

85
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,670
also power directions via SMS to any

86
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,930
user can send us<font color="#CCCCCC"> two addresses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from here</font>

87
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,569
to there the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> message and we'll send</font>

88
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,069
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a text message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back with the</font>

89
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:37,319
directions within one second so there's

90
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,090
multiple ways that you can interface

91
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,250
with us and we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just looking at</font>

92
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,440
mobile and equated it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone</font>

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,049
looking at mobile and saying iphone is

94
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,849
one of the ways that you can consume

95
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,590
information in a mobile environment but

96
00:03:49,590 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's many other ways as well</font>
