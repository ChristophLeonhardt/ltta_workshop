00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,520
really book based cuz I'm read quite a

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,200
bit the moment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought I'd talk</font>

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,760
about it as well as things that I'm

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,160
about to read before is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let</font>

any Leo for for telling me about Guidry

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,980
would have kind of fallen in love with

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,500
an old crazy one and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't loads of</font>

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,170
books and now much for them like 90

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,730
go yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been reading a moment I</font>

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,160
recently well I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently but a few</font>

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks ago I finished the winter of our</font>

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,050
discontent which I really enjoyed I

18
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,899
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was I don't know Edward quite</font>

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,739
a bit lighter stuff at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and I</font>

20
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,480
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read something slightly more</font>

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,289
intellectual per se and I really enjoyed

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,430
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting how</font>

23
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,000
incredibly honest he was about human

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,479
personality I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,390
there's kind of dust over and sugar her

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,110
everything and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,540
them steals and when they would but then

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,420
again he was also very honest about our

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,549
kind of hesitation about everything and

30
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,600
just in general and<font color="#CCCCCC"> on kind of feels</font>

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,930
like an expendable but it's the

32
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,070
everything's not black and white that's

33
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,520
kind of that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand unlike the edge</font>

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,400
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> either go one way you can get another</font>

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,869
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be does not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet there's nothing</font>

36
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,729
else to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a one ended because you</font>

37
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,680
constantly flipping back between these

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,950
two sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know you should do it</font>

39
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,030
will be will do and then you kind of go

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,530
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what you should do damage oh now</font>

41
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,689
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enjoyed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I it will</font>

42
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,720
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in the right mindset and really</font>

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,159
sass differently to read and that's

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely something that i would</font>

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,270
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read another book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've read</font>

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,490
recently was filing violet park but

47
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,090
Johnny Valentine which was one quickly

48
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,100
gone quite a recognition recently it's

49
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,519
quite nice read because it wasn't quite

50
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's really thinking heavy you</font>

51
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,440
thought heavy it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought for</font>

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,140
anything they're not in the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,560
same way it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Vista very well</font>

54
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,650
told story it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clever and it's</font>

55
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,819
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things everything just</font>

56
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,560
comes together at the end and you just

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,629
had this understanding than skateland

58
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,160
and I really like the main character as

59
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,690
well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we let all the characters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

60
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">just thought it was a really good</font>

61
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,629
stories look how Wednesday was running

62
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,940
my favorite stories but it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting</font>

63
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,860
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> four out of five stars and like</font>

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,989
it's really quite well watching

65
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,819
forbidden little glad that was going so

66
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">much recognition because it means up a</font>

67
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,310
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who go only on awards and</font>

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,099
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> they buy books solely based on</font>

69
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,720
that for their children or for

70
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,390
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a good lead which</font>

71
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,290
is refreshing for change<font color="#CCCCCC"> slightly better</font>

72
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,110
than the kind of average which nudie

73
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,569
pics another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read was a gathering</font>

74
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,310
light by Jennifer Donelan which I

75
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,209
realized wait something's actually

76
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,940
published in those states under and more

77
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,560
than Northern Lights I think that's the

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">original and move them like I think I</font>

79
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,239
don't know why that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if that</font>

80
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,470
changed me it was cuz the whole northern

81
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,709
lights thing but I really loved it I

82
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,139
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of I was get powering through it</font>

83
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,599
until about three quarters the way

84
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,480
through when I just instantly fell in

85
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,900
love with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the book I kind of brittle was</font>

86
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,000
a bit kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of screaming my head mentally</font>

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">at main character units where's were</font>

88
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,250
about about 1900s and I met kind of

89
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,480
parallels with the merger in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,230
nineteen hundreds and you just see

91
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,780
separate it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of reason why I</font>

92
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,079
say is is like kind of jewel collect

93
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,819
regional action<font color="#E5E5E5"> its row two different</font>

94
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,299
types of space not rising actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

95
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,269
something else anyhow that and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses</font>

96
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,910
like something of power in one place of

97
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,510
time

98
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,980
they found another piece of time and

99
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,390
it's just able just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so brilliant and I</font>

100
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,659
really enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and finished it going</font>

101
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,920
this might have been to possibly because

102
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,209
I can feel myself talking about that

103
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">with his lips</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree and then the next</font>

104
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,699
one which is probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

105
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:19,459
controversial one that I've never talked

106
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,680
about it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be Twilight chair</font>

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,870
finish last night and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I need</font>

108
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,240
be one person in the world really didn't

109
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,789
like it Bella just I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

110
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,880
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Moodle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Edward I just</font>

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,250
got myself screaming at her I just like

112
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,760
I can't stand her I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> her I really</font>

113
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,669
like such strong personalities and I

114
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,130
really like people who just step in and

115
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,919
do stuff only sometimes it might not

116
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">need the most realistic thing but when</font>

117
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,830
you writing a story I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt so</font>

118
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,620
weak that she<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of annoyed me and I</font>

119
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,960
didn't feel that it was realistic of I

120
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,940
mean obviously pinging what do I know

121
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,320
about high school hierarchies but I

122
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,600
didn't feel it was realistic about high

123
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,389
school in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I don't know I didn't</font>

124
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,680
think she captured it very well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

125
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,900
I'm already into vampire stories either

126
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,880
and I reckon<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I went into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it slightly</font>

127
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,889
attention to me but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of</font>

128
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,690
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone says it's fantastic and</font>

129
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,580
this obviously quite were loud thump I

130
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,500
sorry the plot was really weak and

131
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,970
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> really happened in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end was a</font>

132
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,800
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> relative climax it was all just like</font>

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,150
oh so I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed the last my red</font>

which was really depressing but I was in

136
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,860
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> depressed mood at the time I was</font>

137
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">quiet like reading stuff and it kind of</font>

138
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,320
brings you down quite a lot throw bits

bladder<font color="#CCCCCC"> glitcher and it's amazing</font>

140
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,490
because it's about its own manic

141
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,130
depression is amazing when they have
