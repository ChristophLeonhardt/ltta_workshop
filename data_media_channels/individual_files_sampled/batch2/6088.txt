the Los Angeles Times has published a piece indicating that six women have spoken to the reporters and Amie Kaufman and Daniel Miller implicating Brett Ratner in sexual harassment or misconduct cases now these are women who had been silent about what they had gone through previously and decided to come forward following this domino effect that the allegations against Harvey Weinstein have had now there are a number of women I'm gonna do my best to detail all of them but first I want to start with Olivia Munn because Olivia Munn had written something about Ratner in her book back in 2010 although she didn't name him and you know the the allegations that she's now detailing are horrendous so here is what she had to say about it she had alleged that back when she had first moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting she was working on set for a movie that Ratner was in charge of he was a filmmaker for that movie I've got the exact quotes here from the Los Angeles Times which did a great job of reporting on this story Olivia Munn said that while visiting the set of the 2004 Ratner directed after the sunset when she was still an aspiring actress he masturbated in front of her in his trailer where she went to deliver a meal Martin wrote about the incident in her 2010 collection of essays without naming Ratner when I television show a year later Ratner identified himself as a director and claimed that he had quote banged her and now let me go to Ratner's quotes about that which were all lies and we'll explain that in a second he said I used to date Olivia Munn I'll be honest with everybody here was she was Lisa and that was a name that he claimed she used that was the problem she was an Asian back then and he go went on to say I banged her a few times but I forgot her days later he went on the Howard Stern Show it admitted that he had in fact never slept with Munn he was quoted as saying on Howard Stern Show I felt horrible I said I banged her three times which wasn't true so back in 2010 we Julie covered this story and it was because Ratner had used a gay slur and when he had used that gay slur and got criticism for it Olivia Munn's book also came up and all of the reporting about it made it seem as though they had some sort of consensual sexual relationship with one another and that Olivia Munn went on to say disparaging things about him in the book she made comments about his penis size and we talked about that and again for for those of you who might have missed that story because it was seven years ago we were under the impression because it was reported over and over again that they had a consensual sexual relationship Entertainment Weekly specifically said that and then later retracted it after a Radner made it clear that he lied about having sex with her so they did apologize for it Entertainment Weekly incorrectly stated in an earlier post that Muntz says she dated the unnamed actor we regret the error okay so based on that false reporting erroneous reporting we commented on it and I unfortunately called Olivia Munn classless because I was under the assumption that she just sent disparaging things about him after having consensual sex they never had sex he had harassed her I did not know that not giving myself any excuses at all under any circumstances and I feel horrible our commentary was based on bad reporting and I should have known better well okay so first of all the most important thing here is that Olivia Munn was completely smeared and it's horrible and and so the the way that it went down as an I explained is first Brett Ratner lied about what happened and she had actually the class to not name him in the book even though he'd done something terrible to her and the more of the details of that story now that it has fully come out is that she was new to Hollywood they told her that he wasn't even gonna be in the trailer they're like you need just deliver this meal to the trailer she goes in thinks it's empty he comes out with a shrimp cocktail illness and naked masturbating and and and finishes there and she said what are the world and she screams as she runs out afterwards he lies as all yeah I banged her as you as the in the quotes that we read to you now when we did the story seven years ago Ratner had not admitted that he had lied and there was incorrect reporting that she had said that she did have sex with him which is totally false that she created him not just sex that they were dating yeah and so based on that that incorrect fact pattern we said wait if you dated the guy and and now you're calling out his size etc that's wrong okay but we have the wrong facts so now that we see the full facts adhere in like I said Eliot I was wonderful piece of reporting not just from Olivia Munn who has three different people corroborating our story from at the time not now and five other women also with corroborated witnesses at the time not now okay that we see that in fact it was Brett Ratner who was lying all throughout and had done all these terrible things and and and Olivia Munn was the one who was the victim undoubtedly and had to suffer through this and then have to deal with the Ratner saying all these terrible things for all these years yeah and and look I think not I think I know that the mo for these types of people these types of predatory individuals is to smear the person that they victimized and look even though it was false reporting I feel terrible that that I fell for it and I just want to be clear about that because I feel like I should have been more skeptical first of all of Entertainment Weekly and I should have done a better job in covering that story so I just want to be clear about that now let's move on to other women and the accusations that they have made against Brett Ratner one of them is a model named Natasha Hine Strich and she said that when she was 19 years old and Ratner was in his 20s he prevented her from leaving his apartment after watching a movie and her accusations are so disturbing he's strong on me in a real weh-weh he physically forced himself on me at some point I gave in and did his thing she claims that he had forced her to perform oral sex on him so look I want to talk a little bit more about the courage of these women because unfortunately still in today's society there's great shame and oftentimes embarrassment and even if it's a situation you can't control and and it takes so much courage to come out and say this happened and I was an unwilling participant in this and for Henstridge to come out and say yeah it happened and I'm not gonna take it anymore for Olivia Munn to say look in the beginning she was actually trying to hide his identity and she was doing the right thing and now saying look enough is enough man there was another incident late years later Olivia Munn runs into a Ratner at a party and he's ago why do you hate me gee I wonder why Brett I can't quite tell right and and he's she says why I'd say dislike being again super nice super nice right and he says well I mean I'm so nice to you I bought ten magazines with your picture on and I masturbated to it okay and talked about ejaculating on the covers of the magazines etc by the way corroborating witnesses at the time at the party that here's I'm saying that so for her and so Olivia Munn very rightfully so coming out and saying no I'm not gonna take it anymore we all shouldn't take it anymore I love the strength and courage of these women and so there's there's many others here and it's about time that everybody fought back and and and I agree with Anna I feel terrible that at the beginning the this story was incorrectly reported and then and we took the wrong facts and and had there reacted to it yeah and and look the worst part is I know from personal experience what it's like to be lied about in the media and then have people pile on based on something that's not true at all in any way shape or form and to know that I played a role that's similar to that in any way makes me feel horrible I would never make excuses for any type of sexual predator I feel terrible if she ever saw that video or you know thinks that we have that type of mindset because we don't okay anyway it's this is this is a very humbling experience for me personally and it makes you realize you got to do better another actress by the name of Newman says that she encountered Ratner in a 2000 in 2005 Jamie ray Newman to be specific encountered him in 2005 when they were both in first class on an Air Canada flight the filmmakers swap seats with his assistant before departure so he could be next to her within five minutes of the plane taking off she said Ratner began loudly describing sex acts he wanted to perform on her in explicit detail so he was so loud that other people on the plane allegedly heard what he was saying and she was incredibly uncomfortable and obviously they're on a plane and she can't get away from him and he took complete advantage of that opportunity he was graphically describing giving me oral sex and how he was addicted to it look there are acts that are despicable and there are acts that are illegal and so I don't understand guys who who do this stuff I guess that they think they they're used to wielding their power especially on a plane people can't get away from you they have to sit next to you for god knows how long and on this show we had a co-host who told about how she was sexually assaulted on a plane and and women have to deal with being hit on all the time non-stop but then Ratner on top of that the things that he did to Henstridge and Olivia Munn which were non-consensual sexual acts it's just there's no end to to this he brags about how his best friends are the the director Toback who just who is also facing allegations from 300 incidents 300 he also brings out one of his best friends is Roman Polanski who brags about that so when you read the entire LA Times story he gives a great context into what happened and and beyond just Ratner it is unfortunately it appears endemic to not just Hollywood but to society that men in powerful positions whether it was TV like Roger Ailes Bill Cosby and Brett Ratner and Harvey Weinstein took advantage of those positions far far too often and and not just in the 1970s 80s 90s but all the way up until now and and I think that it's a wonderful phenomenon that women are coming out and saying no more help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
