IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A TOUGHER OR MORE IMPORTANT JOB THAN BEING A AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER. GO AHEAD AND TRY, IT WILL TAKE YOU A WHILE. EVERY DAY MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS FLY IN OR OUT OF U.S. AIRPORTS, ALONG WITH MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CARGO. AT ANY ONE TIME THERE ARE 5,000 AIRCRAFT ABOVE THE UNITED STATES. ON 9/11, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS GUIDED EVERY ONE OF THEM TO A SAFE LANDING IN A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR. GO AHEAD AND TRY THAT. IT'S A JOB WHERE A SMALL MISTAKE COULD LEAD INSTANTLY TO THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE HIRING STANDARDS FOR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS WERE LONG AMONG THE MOST SELECTIVE OF ALL FEDERAL JOBS. APPLICANTS TYPICALLY NEEDED TO COMPLETE MILITARY SERVICE OR PASS THE FAA'S COLLEGIATE TRAINING INITIATIVE PROGRAM. AFTER THAT THEY SAT FOR A SPECIALLY-DESIGNED EXAM THAT TESTED FOR MATH ABILITY AND COMPLEX PROBLEM-SOLVING. ONLY THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST SCORES MADE THE CUT. THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO CHOOSE THE BEST. FOR DECADES IT WORKED. THEN DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, ACTIVIST BUREAUCRATS DECIDED THAT THE POOL OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS WASN'T DIVERSE ENOUGH. THEY NEVER EXPLAINED WHY DIVERSITY OUGHT TO MATTER IN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, OR WHY IT WAS MORE THAN TRADITIONAL GOALS LIKE COMPETENCE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE FAA WITHOUT A VOTE, JUST SCRAPPED THE OLD HIRING SYSTEM AND REPLACED IT WITH A DIVERSITY FRIENDLY VERSION. MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA THIS HAPPENED. THE FAA REQUIRES APPLICANTS TO FILL OUT A BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE ANOTHER SCREENING. THOSE THAT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IN A WAY THAT DIVERSITY MONITORS DON'T LIKE WILL NOT GO FURTHER, BECAUSE THE BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONNAIRE IS ALL IMPORTANT. WE GOT A COPY OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE, HOW IT'S SCORED. IT'S SHOCKING. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE QUESTION ASKED TEST-TAKERS TO NAME THEIR WORST THE PROTESTER ANSWER FOR THAT IS SCIENCE. IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU CAN'T DO SCIENCE, THE FAA IS SPECIALLY EAGER TO HIRE YOU AS AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER. YOU GET 10 POINTS FOR BEING BAD AT SCIENCE, ACCORDING TO THE SCORING SHEET. ANOTHER QUESTION ASKED ABOUT WORK HISTORY. ACCORDING TO THE FAA, THE BEST ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YOU HAVEN'T WORKED AT ALL IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. YOU GET 10 POINTS FOR NOT WORKING. APPARENTLY UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE MAKE THE BEST AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. THIS IS DEMENTED, BY THE WAY, BUT IT'S REAL. SO DO APPLICANTS WHO PLAYED A LOT OF SPORTS IN HIGH SCHOOL. THEY'RE REWARDED TOO. BY CONTRAST APPLICANTS WHO SAY THEY KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL GET ONLY FIVE POINTS. TRAINED PILOTS GET TWO POINTS. ONCE AGAIN, APPLICANTS WHO HAVEN'T WORKED AT ALL, WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, GET 10 POINTS. PILOTS TWO POINTS. THIS IS INSANE. IT'S DANGEROUS. IT'S ALSO INDEFENSIBLE. WE ASKED THE FAA'S TOP SPOKESMAN WHY APPLICANTS FOR AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL JOB WOULD GET MORE POINTS FOR HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS THAN FLYING PLANES OR KNOWING A LOT ABOUT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. HIS RESPONSE, QUOTE, I'M TRYING TO FIND THAT OUT AS WELL. WELL, NOT TRYING VERY HARD IT TURNS OUT. WE STILL HAVEN'T HEARD BACK WITH A REAL EXPLANATION, AND OF COURSE WE WON'T BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ONE, OTHER THAN SHUT UP, DIVERSITY. WE WON'T SHUT UP. THIS IS TOO PAR. LIVES ARE AT STAKE. JOINING IS MICHAEL PEARSON, A LAWYER REPRESENTING A MAN SUING THE FAA FOR ITS UPDATED HIRING PRACTICES. MR. PEARSON, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. THANK YOU, TUCKER. GOOD TO BE HERE. WHY WOULD THE FAA AWARD EXTRA POINTS FOR INCOMPETENCE? SCIENCE, FOR EXAMPLE? WELL, THE BIOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT WAS MADE TO SCREEN OUT PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE. IT WASN'T MEANT IN ANY FORM OR FUNCTION, THAT I CAN FIND AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS NOW, INCLUDING LOOKING OVER MANY DOCUMENTS WE HAD TO FIGHT THE FAA FOR SEVERAL YEARS THAT THEY KEPT HIDDEN TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THE TEST WAS BASICALLY MEANT TO SCREEN OUT PEOPLE WITH AVIATION EXPERIENCE. THERE'S EVEN WORSE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE TEST, BUT YOU DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF PORTRAYING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE TEST. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. JUST TO RESTATE FOR OUR AUDIENCE, SO NUMB TO THIS KIND OF THINKING THAT IT MAY NOT PENETRATE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HIRING A SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS, WITH A LINCHPIN OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRANSPORTATION. WHY WOULD THE FAA WANT PEOPLE WITH LESS RELEVANT SKILLS IN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FOR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS? BECAUSE A GROUP WITHIN THE FAA, INCLUDING THE HUMAN RESOURCES FUNCTION WITHIN THE FAA, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL BLACK COALITION OF FEDERAL AVIATION EMPLOYEES, DETERMINED THAT THE WORKFORCE WAS TOO WHITE. THEY HAD A CONCERTED EFFORT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, TO CHANGE THAT. AND QUITE FRANKLY, THEY'RE SACRIFICING, AND HAVE SACRIFICED SAFETY AT THE 589ER OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. IT OFFENDS THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUS, BUT ALSO FEDERAL LAW. WE'RE EXPOSING THAT. WHY WOULD THIS GO ON FOR YEARS WITHOUT ANYBODY IN ELECTED OFFICE SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT IT? JUST ONCE AGAIN I'M HARD TO SHOCK, BECAUSE I DO THIS STUFF FOR A LIVING WE ARE LOWERING THE STANDARDS, AND INTENTIONALLY HIRING PEOPLE LESS COMPETENT FOR ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL JOBS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? WHY WOULD NO ONE IN CONGRESS DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT? WELL, OUR LAW FIRM, ALONG WITH MOUNTAIN STATE'S LEGAL FOUNDATION, FILED THE INITIAL LAWSUIT. THEN THE GROUP OF SCHOOLS GOT TOGETHER, OVER 30 COLLEGIATE TRAINING INSTITUTIONAL SCHOOLS GOT TOGETHER AND WENT TO CONGRESS. THERE HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT HAVE HELD HEARINGS ON THIS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UNION CONTROLS A LARGE PACT THAT FUNDS POLITICIANS, AND NOTHING WILL GET PAST WITHOUT THE BLESSING OF THE CONTROLLERS UNION. THEIR POSITION RADICALLY CHANGED WHEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CAME IN. I'M NOT SAYING THAT LIGHTLY. I WAS AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER AT FOUR OF THE BUSIEST FACILITIES IN THE COUNTRY FOR ALMOST 27 YEARS, ALONG WITH BEING AN ATTORNEY AND PROFESSOR. WHEN I SAY THESE THINGS, IT'S NOT ONLY BASED ON EXPERIENCE, BUT DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND PROOF I HAVE. AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYONE FLIES, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHO FLY QUITE OFTEN. I THINK THE ONES THAT HEARD THE STORY WERE OFFENDED BY IT, BECAUSE IT'S IN THEIR BACKYARD. IT'S A SAFETY INTEREST FOR THEM. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE, QUITE FRANKLY, BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT'S THE SAFETY OF THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE AT RISK HERE. I CAN TELL YOU FROM TRAINING WELL OVER A HUNDRED, PROBABLY 300 CONTROLLERS IN MY LIFETIME AS AN FAA CONTROLLER, THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. THIS IS AIKEN TO THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HIRING DOCTORS AND TRYING TO TELL THE PUBLIC THAT THE BEST PHYSICIAN IS ONE THAT NEVER WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THAT THE VA CAN TRAIN THEM BETTER. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S OCCURRED HERE. TO BE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS NOT COVERED THIS, AND HAS COVERED UP THIS ISSUE, AND HAS NOT REVEALED WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S A SHAME. IT'S NOT ONLY SHAMEFUL, IT AGAIN SACRIFICES PUBLIC SAFETY. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING, PEOPLE IN THE FAA WE SPOKE TO, WERE SUCH COWARDLY WORMS, I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY, BUT THEY WON'T COME ON AND DEFEND THIS. A RHETORICAL QUESTION, DID THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION EVER SHOW WITH DATA THAT SOMEHOW INCREASED DIVERSITY? THE RANKS OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS WOULD MAKE THE PUBLIC SAFER? ABSOLUTELY NOT. THERE'S DATA THAT SHOWS IT'S A PUBLIC FARCE, INCORRECT. THERE'S NO DATA TO SUPPORT THAT. THIS IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST AT THE SACRIFICE AGAIN OF PUBLIC SAFETY. IT'S TOTALLY DEMENTED. WE'LL RIDE THIS UNTIL IT'S MADE
