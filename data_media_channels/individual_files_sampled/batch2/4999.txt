Hillary Clinton is for open borders she is in favor of even taking Syrian refugees even though the Islamic state has told us they're going to put their operatives in with the Syrian refugees operatives who are terrorists who are going to come to Western Europe and come here and tell us many people have noted that Rudolph Giuliani has how do we say this change since the days when he earned the title America's mayor here in New York in the aftermath of 9/11 people who go way back with him have been struck by his turn toward the authoritarian his willingness to say things he never would have dreamed of saying as a law-and-order Republican of old like referring to the FBI as stormtroopers he's back in the news tonight for blowing up the Trump legal strategy on stormy Daniels just last night but during that same appearance with Sean Hannity Giuliani seemingly used his live television opportunity to publicly negotiate with Muller on what it would take to get Donald Trump to agree to an interview along the way he engaged in some creative constitutional law which we'll talk about in just a moment beginning with his pronouncement on presidents and subpoenas if they issue a subpoena that will be that will be unprecedented in the sense that it's pretty clear that a president can't be subpoenaed to a criminal proceeding about him we have the real life circumstance going on that the founding fathers thought about which is a president cannot be distracted by a criminal investigation you can always prosecute them after if most said to me tomorrow bring them in two hours it's like you want no questions that you don't want and we're pretty much ready to clear him I could not go to the president United States and say take two days off to get ready for that and screw the whole thing with North Korea he is going to negotiate I believe a non-nuclear situation on the Korean evening thanks a lot nobody thought about here all right now you're gonna interfere with that that's why the founding fathers created this immunity from prosecution and subpoena now if it's a civil case couldn't submitted because with a civil case so much to react to there so little time but we have the perfect attorney to do @jill wine banks attorney and former assistant Watergate special counsel all so thankfully an MSNBC legal analyst Jill let's take them in order can presidents be subpoenaed and we have looked in vain for the shalt not distract the president clause and a constitution and we haven't darn had all been able to find it do you know of it gosh darn know it doesn't exist Rudy Giuliani is making up precedent he said it's unprecedented what is US v Nixon the case in Watergate when the president was subpoenaed for his documents and the Supreme Court said in absolutely unmistakable language that that was enforceable he had to produce them that's what led to the smoking gun tape the one that forced him to resign rather than be convicted in the Senate after articles of impeachment in the house so yes the president can be subpoenaed in a criminal case involving his own conduct I'm not being argumentative I will say that in the hour after Giuliani made those comments last night on Lawrence O'Donnell's program the point was made Richard Nixon was running the Vietnam War during all of his legal troubles some of which were caused by you and secondly no one has factored in the distraction of this president on an average day and I say not with humor Fox and Friends for a couple hours every morning well I would say that's a very legitimate thing there is of course no excuse for he can't be distracted the founders didn't think about that they didn't write it but this president spends an untold number of hours watching television he spends an untold number of hours playing golf if he has time for Twitter golf and television and calling in to Fox and Friends whenever he wants in his pajamas then he has time to prepare his defense and if the president can be brought before a civil court which is far less important than defending in a criminal case then he certainly can be called upon to defend in a criminal case and we know that Bill Clinton the court said could have a civil case proceeded against him while he was president so this just makes no sense this is just made-up false information as we Rudy Giuliani should know better as we mentioned mr. avenatti made news with Lawrence tonight I want to play a little bit more of that just to have you explained to all of us laypeople why it's significant so here it is there were extensive discussions in October of 2016 when this was being negotiated relating to the fact that the payment had to be made prior to or in it well in advance of the presidential election the 2016 presidential election so this whole idea that the payment had nothing to do with the timing associated with the election or happened to just be a coincidence is completely bogus everybody and their brother knew it had everything to do with the election it had everything to do with making sure nothing was disclosed prior to the election it had everything to do with the payment and the receipt of the money prior to the election period okay counselor why is that important it's important for two reasons one there's been some talk that oh this was just done to protect Melania poor Melania had to be protected that totally undercuts it because it shows that the reason that it was done was to protect the president from it coming out before the election he didn't want this information to be in the voters hands and minds when they pulled the levers for the election and so it also goes to the intent of the payment if the payment was to influence the election which that seems to clearly suggest that it is then it is a campaign violation and not something personal hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos
