you and I were sort of talking a little bit off-camera about this notion of major banks now divesting from fossil fuels and this sort of started in the EU with the World Bank and then ing divesting from coal and fossil fuels but then we saw it trickle into Canada so HSBC has now said that they're not going to invest in any sort of oil sands energy projects and last week some wackadoodles in Seattle were protesting outside of Chase Bank to encourage them to divest from fossil fuels and you were saying this is sort of a coordinated next step in the environmentalist attack on fossil fuels yes and you have to realize that this has gone on for a very long time like I think was Rainforest Action Network or a.n or ran as they call themselves back in about 2004 they did a big attack on banks and there's a group that was set up in around 2003 I believe it was called Bank track they rapidly hate fossil fuels they're out of the Netherlands and they're about 40 nonprofit NGOs that are all associated and basically their mandate in life is to harass the heck out of banks and try and get them to not fund any fossil fuel projects they certainly love to hate the oil sands most of their rabbit material our website is against the oil sands they've recently really gone after coal and we just did a report called unfriend a NGOs because these NGOs are now attacking also the insurance companies so if you can't finance your project and if you can't get insurance for it you can't do business now you know as you said this is not scientific this is activism pure ideological activism because the world runs on about 80% fossil fuels right now and the balance is maybe you know hydro and biomass and nuclear with maybe 2% maybe 2% from wind and solar for all the people who say autumn are oh if we kept fossil fuels we can just go to wind and solar that's impossible so these people are very very dangerous to society because they're unelected they're unaccountable they have no regulations that they have to abide by and they can say anything they want they can do any kind of inflammatory protest and say anything they want that may or may not be true or may be wildly exaggerated and you know we've seen that in the past over and over again especially about the oil sands and actually when you look at it it is a geopolitical green trade war against Canada that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
