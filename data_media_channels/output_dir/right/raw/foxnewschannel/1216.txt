LET'S BE CLEAR HERE.

114
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:45,577
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS

115
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:46,778
VIOLATED THE CLAUSE IN THE

116
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:47,212

138
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:17,976

>> THIS IS WHAT THE RUSSIANS

142
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,347
JUST DID.

143
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:23,448
THE RUSSIANS JUST ACTUALLY

144
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:24,382
PUT OUT SOMETHING IN

145
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:25,550
RESPONSE TO THIS AD SAYING

PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE THEY

148
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:30,355
WANTED TO SEE HIM WIN.

149
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:30,989
PETE: RUSSIANS CAN SAY

150
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:31,890
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,291
LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THEY

152
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,793

PETE: ARE THEY BOTH ENEMIES.

188
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:17,969

THAT'S THE PROPAGANDA THAT

238
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,567
COMES OUT SOMETIMES.

239
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:23,935
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE
