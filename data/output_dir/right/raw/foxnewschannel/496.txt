1
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:03,721
MEAN SENATOR CHRIS, WHO WATCHED

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,323
AND HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF

3
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:05,623
TEARS.

4
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:07,325
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT

5
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:09,661
HAPPENS GOING FORWARD.

6
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,929
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS VOTE

7
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,730
RIGHT NOW AND WE WILL KNOW IN

8
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,666
JUST A FEW MOMENTS IF IT DOES

9
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:15,900
SHAKE OUT 11-10 OR SOMEHOW

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,037
DIFFERENT THAN THAT, WE WILL

11
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:20,805
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT JUDGE BRETT

12
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:21,539
KAVANAUGH WILL BE FULL SENATE

13
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,977
VOTE NEXT WEEK TO BECOME THE

14
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:27,979
NEXT JUSTICE ON THE

15
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:28,446
SUPREME COURT.

16
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,849
WHERE DO WE STAND IN WASHINGTON

17
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:32,317
WITH PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO WORK

18
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:33,251
THINGS OUT?

19
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:36,021
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY, REALLY

20
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:36,454
NASTY, CHRIS.

21
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:38,056
>> LET ME TALK FIRST OF ALL

22
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:40,225
ABOUT THE PROCESS BECAUSE EVEN

23
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:43,862
IF THEY WERE TO VOTE NOT TO

24
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:44,796
REFER THE NOMINATION OF BRETT

25
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:45,930
KAVANAUGH, THAT WOULD NOT STOP

26
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,432
THE SENATE FROM TAKING A VOTE.

27
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:51,036
IF YOU WERE TO GO DOWN 11-10

28
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:51,703
RATHER THAN REPORTED OUT

29
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:54,372
FAVORABLY 11-10, IT CAN STILL BE

30
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:55,607
BROUGHT TO THE SENATE FLOOR IN

31
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:56,908
THE WAY THAT WOULD WORK IS THAT

32
00:00:56,908 --> 00:01:00,312
TOMORROW IT WOULD BE BROUGHT UP

33
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:03,615
AND ON MONDAY THERE WOULD BE A

34
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:06,051
VOTE TO CUT OFF DEBATE AND THE

35
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:07,853
CONFIRMATION WOULD HAPPEN ON

36
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:08,186
TUESDAY.

37
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:09,287
AS BRET BAIER MENTIONED A FEW

38
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:10,622
MOMENTS AGO, THERE IS STILL SOME

39
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:14,926
DOUBT ABOUT TWO MODERATE WOMEN

40
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:16,962
IN THE SENATE, REPUBLICAN WOMEN,

41
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:17,929
LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND

42
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:20,799
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE.

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,567
WE DON'T KNOW, THEY HAVE NOT

44
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,369
ANNOUNCED.

45
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,738
SUSAN COLLINS AS OF LATE MORNING

46
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:28,173
HAS SAID SHE IS STILL UNDECIDED

47
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:29,408
ON THIS AND I SUSPECT IF WE ARE

48
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:31,810
NOT GOING TO HAVE US UNTIL

49
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,211
TUESDAY SHE WILL HEAR FROM A LOT

50
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:36,048
OF CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME IN

51
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:37,049
MAINE.

52
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,417
AS FAR AS RELATIONS ON

53
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,585
CAPITOL HILL AND BETWEEN THE TWO

54
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:41,787
PARTIES, YESTERDAY WAS ABOUT AS

55
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:42,554
UGLY AS I'VE EVER SEEN IT AND

56
00:01:42,554 --> 00:01:45,223
I'VE BEEN IN THIS TOWN FOR 40

57
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:46,425
YEARS.

58
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:48,193
YOU'VE SEEN SPIRITED DEBATES,

59
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:50,162
SOME ANGRY DEBATES, BUT

60
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:54,766
YESTERDAY WAS UGLY AND BITTER.

61
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,802
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU SAW

62
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:59,905
LINDSEY GRAHAM SNAP BACK AFTER

63
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:03,842
THESE ATTACKS BY DEMOCRATS ON

64
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:05,277
KAVANAUGH WHEN THEY WERE TALKING

65
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:06,812
ABOUT DRINKING GAMES AND HIS

66
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:07,379
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

67
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:08,814
AND HE SAID THIS IS THE MOST

68
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:09,548
DESPICABLE THING I'VE EVER SEEN

69
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:13,218
IN THIS TOWN AND ANY REPUBLICAN

70
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:16,021
WHO VOTES NO VOTES AGAINST THE

71
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:20,826
NOMINATION IS LEGITIMIZING THAT,

72
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:21,694
THIS ISN'T JUST PEOPLE PLAYING

73
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:26,131
ON TV AND THEY GO AS IT OFTEN

74
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,300
HAPPENS, HOPEFULLY SO, YOU CAN

75
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,635
ARGUE ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND GO

76
00:02:29,635 --> 00:00:00,000
OUT AND HAVE A DRINK OR
