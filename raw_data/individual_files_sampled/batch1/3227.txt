eventually I realized that's who he is the inner guide there is no inner guy I did interview him a number of times I went to his office a number of times and then I saw him on other occasions around the country so I saw him a lot certainly when I came to his office I'd have a long list of questions I was a proper biographer your childhood influences you know all the things that biographers want to pursue I never could get an answer really on anything or if I did it was like a monosyllabic what was the influence of military school you'd say something like I got a good education period just there was no I couldn't get any nuance I couldn't get beneath the surface around it was that was all I would get and then he would kind of ramble and then he would talk about one of his accomplishments and it was it was very hard to really dig into anything donnell had no rearview mirror he was just looking ahead you know the past who cares and he just wasn't interested in pursuing that at all and at the time I thought like oh if I just asked it a different way maybe there's a different way to put this question and then I could like get to the inner guy eventually I realized that's who he is the inner guy there is no inner guy he's not an insightful you know introspective guy I mean we've all seen this but in private he's the same way as we see him in public
