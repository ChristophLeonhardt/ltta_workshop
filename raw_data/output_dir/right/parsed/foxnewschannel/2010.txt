BRIAN: PRESIDENT TRUMP
TAKING ON JOHN KERRY AHEAD
OF TODAY'S IRAN
ANNOUNCEMENT.
HE IS THE ONE WHO CREATED
THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THIS IN RESPONSE OF THE
SECRETARY OF STATE SHADOW
DIPLOMACY ON THE VERY BADLY
NEGOTIATED IRANIAN DEAL.
HE WAS THE ONE THAT -- SAVE
THE OBAMA ERA DEAL.
THE BEST OF LUCK
THE BULT OF LUCK
THE BULK OF LUCK
THE BULK OF TUCK
THE BULK OF THEK
THE BULK OF THE NEGOTIATION.
HERE TO EXPLAIN CIA OFFICER
AND RADIO TALK SHOW HOST
BUCK SEXTON.
BUCK, THIS SEEMS TO BE A
VIOLATION OF THE LOGAN ACT,
WHICH IS NEVER PROSECUTED.
THIS IS REALLY OUT OF LINE,
ISN'T IT?
>> I THINK THE FORMER
SECRETARY OF STATE AND HE
NEEDS A REMINDER THAT HE IS
IN FACT FORMER IS WRONG ON
EVERY CONCEIVABLE LEVEL
HERE.
I THINK HE IS WRONG ON THE
SUBSTANCE, WHICH PEOPLE CAN
DISAGREE ON BUT THE IRAN
DEAL HAS SOME FATAL FLAWS IN
IT.
IT HAS FROM THE START.
BALLISTIC MISSILES, THE SUN
SET PROVISIONS, SOME OF THE
SITES THAT DO NOT ACTUALLY
GET INSPECTIONS.
WE CAN DISAGREE ON THAT.
THAT ALL SAID, THERE IS ALSO
A BAD FAITH ELEMENT HERE.
YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE
SECRETARY OF STATE, ONE
ADMINISTRATION AT A TIME.
AND FOR A FORMER SECRETARY
OF STATE TO STEP IN HERE,
BRIAN, AND ACT LIKE THE
SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE
REALLY UNDERMINES THE
AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ENGAGED
IN THESE KIND OF
NEGOTIATIONS.
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
THAT JOHN KERRY IS COACHING
THE OTHER SIDE HERE.
AND THEN AS YOU MENTIONED
THE LOGAN ACT BRINGS IN A
LEGAL ASPECT OF IT.
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW, IT'S BEEN
REPEATED A LOT.
THE LOGAN ACT HAS NEVER BEEN
USED TO PROSECUTE ANYONE.
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED TO
PROSECUTE ANYONE.
IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL IF
IT'S CHALLENGED.
THAT SAID, BRIAN, WHY DO WE
ALL KNOW WHAT THE LOGAN ACT
IS?
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT OF
DISCUSSION ABOUT IT WHEN IT
CAME TO GENERAL FLYNN THE
INCOMING NATIONAL SECURITY
ADVISOR FOR TRUMP.
THE HYPOCRISY HERE IS
JAW-DROPPING.
IN ONE CASE IT'S A BIG DEAL.
IN THIS CASE A MORE
EGREGIOUS AND OBVIOUS
VIOLATION OF THE LOGAN ACT,
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE
CONTRADICTS ON THIS.
AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHY.
BRIAN: FLYNN WAS ABOUT TO
GET THE JOB.
KERRY IS OUT OF A JOB.
>> CORRECT.
BRIAN: NUMBER TWO, MET WITH
THE EU FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF.
HE HAS MET WITH MACRON OF
FRANCE.
HE HAS MET WITH THE GERMAN
PRESIDENT AND MET TWICE WITH
THE IRANIAN FOREIGN
MINISTER.
ALL TO KEEP THIS GOING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW THE --
ANY BUSH OFFICIAL FELT LIKE
SECRETARY OF STATE RICE
PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDE TO
PULL US OUT OF IRAQ
THEREFORE CREATING ISIS KEPT
HIS MOUTH SHUT.
WHAT DID SIS KISSINGER DO AS
WE ABANDONED VIETNAM?
HOW DID HE FEEL ABOUT THAT.
HE KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT.
IF ASKED HE WOULD RESPOND
BUT NOT LOBBY OTHER
GOVERNMENTS.
HERE IS WHAT THE KERRY
SPOKESPERSON HAD TO SAY.
HE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT
THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT THAT
TOOK THE WORLD YEARS TO
NEGOTIATE REMAIN EFFECTIVE
AS COUNTRIES FOCUS ON
STABILITY IN REGION.
HE SAID TRUMP IS ONLY GOING
TO BE IN POWER A COUPLE OF
YEARS.
>> THIS IS SOMETHING WE
EXPECT FROM THE TALIBAN TO
HAVE A SHADOW GOVERNMENT IN
PLACE.
NOT FROM OUR OWN FORMER
SECRETARY OF STATE.
BRIAN: GOTCHA.
>> THIS IS REALLY BEYOND THE
PALE TO.
HAVE MEETINGS LIKE THIS,
THIS IS NOT CASUAL, THIS IS
NOT SOMEONE WHO IS JUST
TALKING.
