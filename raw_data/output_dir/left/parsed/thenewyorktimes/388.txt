He runs one of the most
enigmatic countries
on the planet, a nuclear-armed
police state all but sealed off
from the rest of the world.
Kim Jong Un is only 33, but
since taking power after his
father Kim Jong Il died in 2011,
he's asserted himself using
missile tests, ruthless
purges of top advisers,
and a war of words
with the rest.
Like other dictators before
him, he rules the country with
an iron fist.
Dissent doesn't
exist in North Korea.
And its citizens are fed a
steady stream of propaganda
designed to prop up Kim's
cult of personality.
Kim is often seen presiding
over vast military parades
or missile tests.
In one of the odder moments
on the international stage,
he appears palling around with
former NBA player Dennis Rodman
in Pyongyang.
The athlete even serenaded
the leader for his birthday.
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday dear .
Gauging Kim's
intentions is difficult.
Many experts say he's a rational
leader whose sole purpose is
staying in power.
They think he uses his missile
arsenal and nuclear ambitions
to quell dissent internally, but
also to ward off any attempts
by other nations to try and
topple him or call for his
ouster.
In a public address, broadcast
live inside North Korea
in 2012, he pledged to continue
his father's military-first
strategy, demonstrating
his commitment to expanding
the country's nuclear program.
Observers have long pointed
out that Kim Jong Un's rotund
appearance and wide smile signal
his attempts to channel his
grandfather, Kim Il Sung,
the country's founder.
The international community
has tried to put the squeeze
on North Korea's
nuclear program,
using everything from
sanctions to threats.
But like his grandfather
and father before him,
Kim Jong Un tends to meet
pressure with pressure when it
comes to rhetoric or weapons.
