AN HONEST AND AS QUICK A MANNER
AS WE CAN.
>> Mike: CONGRESSMAN CHRIS
STUART, THANKS FOR COMING IN.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
REPORTEDLY WEIGHING THEIR
OPTIONS OF HOUSING MILITARY
CHILDREN AT MILITARY BASES AND A
NEW BILL COULD LEAD TO JAIL TIME
FOR SANCTUARY CITY LEADERS.
ALL THIS IS THE PRESIDENT MEETS
WITH G.O.P. GOVERNORS ON BORDER
SECURITY TONIGHT.
TRACE GALLAGHER IS FOLLOWING THE
LATEST ON IMMIGRATION TONIGHT.
>> MIGHT, AS EXPECTED DURING A
MEETING, THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T
PULL ANY PUNCHES: U.S.
IMMIGRATION LAWS THE WORST IN
THE WORLD.
THE PRESIDENT WAS CLEARLY
SURROUNDED BY A FRIENDLY
AUDIENCE, FIVE G.O.P. GOVERNORS
WHO SUPPORT HIS IMMIGRATION
POLICY, SO THERE WAS LITTLE IN
THE WAY OF DEBATE.
THE MEETING WAS INTENDED MORE TO
PUSH THE IMMIGRATION AGENDA
FORWARD AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS
THERE ARE SMALL STEPS IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION.
WATCH.
>> WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH
CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE CRIPPLING
LOOPHOLES, ESPECIALLY THE
DISGRACEFUL PRACTICE OF CATCH
AND RELEASE.
THAT'S WHERE YOU CATCH SOMEBODY,
TALK TO THEM, SIGN THEM AND THEN
YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM.
AND IT'S A HORRIBLE SITUATION.
>> MEANTIME, THE RECENT SURGE OF
SEVERAL AMERICAN -- REPORTEDLY
HAS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
LOOKING AT FOR MILITARY BASES IN
TEXAS AND ARKANSAS THAT CAN BE
USED TO TEMPORARILY HOUSE
CHILDREN PICKED UP CROSSING THE
BORDER.
THESE ARE EITHER UNACCOMPANIED
MINORS OR KIDS WHOSE PARENTS GOT
ARRESTED FOR ILLEGALLY CROSSING
THE BORDER.
IN APRIL ALONE MORE THAN 10,000
PEOPLE ACROSS THE BORDER AS
FAMILIES WERE APPREHENDED ALONG
WITH SOME 4300 UNACCOMPANIED
CHILDREN.
HHS WON'T CONFIRM THE STORY
EXCEPT TO SAY IT IS ALWAYS
EVALUATING NEW LOCATIONS TO USE
TEMPORARY HOUSING.
IN FACT IT ALREADY OPERATES MORE
THAN 100 SHELTERS FOR MINORS
CAUGHT AT THE BORDER AND DESPITE
THE INFERENCE HERE, SEPARATING
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM
THEIR FAMILIES IS NOT NEW UNDER
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IN FACT, BACK IN 2014 DURING A
SURGE IN CHILDREN FROM
CENTRAL AMERICA HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA
SET UP TEMPORARY HOUSING AT
MILITARY BASES IN CALIFORNIA,
TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA.
AND REMEMBER WHEN THE MAYOR OF
OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, TIPPED OFF
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE
SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA THAT
FEDERAL AGENTS WERE ABOUT TO
CONDUCT AN OPERATION?
NOW IOWA G.O.P. CONGRESSMAN
STEVE KING HAS INTRODUCED THE
ACT, WHICH CALLS FOR JAIL TIME
FOR CITY LEADERS WHO TIPPED OFF
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
KING SAYS I WANT WALLACE
SANCTUARY CITY POLITICIANS TO
HEAR THIS MESSAGE CLEARLY.
IF YOU OBSTRUCT ICE, MEANING
IMMIGRATIONS AND CUSTOMS
ENFORCEMENT, YOU ARE GOING TO
END UP IN THE COOLER.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ARTIE CALLED
FOR HER TO BE PROSECUTED AND SHE
RESPONDED, QUOTING AGAIN,
MR. PRESIDENT, I AM NOT
OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE, I AM
SEEKING IT.
IF THE BILL PASSES CONGRESSMAN
KING'S MEASURE COULD RESULT IN
FIVE-YEAR PRISON TERMS.
