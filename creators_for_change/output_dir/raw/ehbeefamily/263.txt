104
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,280

111
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,200
So

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,700
what we should do is make a pit stop at the grocery store

113
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,200
Why don't we make a giant cookie?

114
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,820
What do you think?

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,159
That's a good idea

116
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,020
uh, no

117
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:33,880
four

118
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,720
no four

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,220
it won't fit in the tray relax

120
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,360

121
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,920

OK let's go

124
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,680
Hello it's time for giant cookie

125
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,220
Woo

126
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,380
I think two tubes is going to be too much

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
Oh

128
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,500

Cookie Cookie

131
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500

133
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,900
I think one tube is enough

134
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,060
One tube fills a whole tray of cookies

135
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,440
if you do two tubes it's gonna pour over and then be a big mess

136
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,480
can we just try?

137
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,140

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,260

Oh, does she get crazy when she's expecting cookies?

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,460
AH

154
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,060
OK let's get this cookie in the oven before she freaks out

155
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,040

well, let me just stick my finger in just to make sure...

166
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,960
No don't stick your finger in it's very dangerous

167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,040
I need to make sure it's the right temperature

168
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,300

169
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,300
