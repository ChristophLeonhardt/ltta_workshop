a book from beyond the grave Junior our Tolkien's final story is on the shelves much to the delight of middle-earth fans this is apparently final yes what's that mean to you it means that they haven't found any other extra writings basically he might have had something stored in a book you know in a shelf somewhere but it means there's no other kind of unpublished stuff the fall of Gondolin was described by the author before his death in 1973 as the first real story of middle-earth it has a Dark Lord orcs elves and unlikely heroes a template for everything he wrote afterwards including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy the work was edited by Tolkien son 93 year-old Christopher Tolkien and illustrated by Alan Lee who's brought numerous Tolkien books to life I don't really think of Tolkien as a as a novelist so much as a storyteller in the tradition of the great storytellers of the past I think that in generations to come we'll be viewing talking on the writer of particularly genre but as somebody who kind of belongs to world literature and and the great kind of ocean of stories oscar-winner Lee was also the conceptual designer for several middle-earth movies the generated fantastical prophets the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogy 'he's made six billion dollars of bag-end Tolkien was one of the first authors to popularize the fantasy genre but many of his themes are grounded in reality he wrote this book whilst recuperating in hospital after the first world war battle of the somme horrors and the bravery he witnessed greatly inspired his work there are stories of adventure adversity and friendship they are tales for all time NIMH Barca al-jazeera London
