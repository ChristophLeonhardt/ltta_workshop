day 624 of the Trump administration and just like that as they say it's all over but the shouting and Brett Kavanaugh appears poised to be the next Justice of the Supreme Court on this front we have some breaking news from the New York Times tonight and we're standing by to talk to one of the reporters breaking the story in just a moment about today we may now have a new benchmark for the division in our country in one of the more dramatic days ever witnessed in Washington the nation watched as the Senate voted to move his nomination to a final vote his confirmation is expected to be approved tomorrow we also saw two key senators who've been publicly undecided until today come out and say how they will vote on Kavanagh this is obviously a huge win for the president we're going to begin with a look at how the day unfolded on Capitol Hill senator Grassley do you know how this votes going to go today I think it'll be very successful what left-wing groups and their Democratic allies have done to judge Kavanagh isn't nothing short of monstrous I hope we can say no to mob rule by voting to confirm judge Kavanagh I miss Murkowski Murkowski know I'm being told she is not voting to move forward on this vote the yeas are 51 the noes are 49 the motion is agreed to I did not come to a decision on this until walking into the floor this morning I believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a good man I believe he is a good man it just may be that in my view he's not the right man for the court at this time do you plan to vote YES tomorrow something big change see what would but this is a difficult decision for everybody it really is and so anyway did our best I would think so the facts presented do not mean that president that Professor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night or at some other time but they do lead me to conclude that the allegations failed to me the more likely than not standard therefore I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court mr. president I will vote to confirm judge cabinet so shortly after Senator Collins announced her long-awaited decision the sole remaining undecided senator Democrat joe Manchin announced his intention to vote yes to putting Kavanaugh on the High Court that's shame you can hear the protesters yelling in the background and just a few hours ago senator Lisa Murkowski said that while she is in her mind a no vote tomorrow she's going to be marked present when the vote actually happens this is procedural and it means that Republican senator Steve Daines of Montana will not have to leave his daughter's wedding in Montana tomorrow to be the 51st vote to put it over the top the White House is likely waiting for that final vote to put out any kind of official response to today's apparent victory however our NBC News colleagues in Washington reports tonight the mood inside the West Wing was one of quote euphoria and release and then tonight as we mentioned this brand new reporting from the New York Times which adds to what we already knew that the scope of the investigation was limited from the start but there's more here the paper says that quote Don McGann according to people familiar with the conversation told the president that even though the White House was facing a storm of condemnation for limiting the FBI background check into sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Breton Cavanaugh a wide-ranging inquiry like some Democrats were demanding and mr. Trump was suggesting would be potentially disastrous for judge Kavanaugh chances of confirmation to the Supreme Court this is a three by line piece of reporting tonight one of the three is standing by by telephone to join us that would be Pulitzer Prize winning Washington correspondent Michael Schmitt and Mike as I said we know that the investigation was limited in scope we know that because there are anywhere from 28 to 40 individuals out there who wanted or expected or both to be contacted by the FBI we know that dr. Ford and judge Cavanaugh were never contacted but you add to it by telling us how this went down and I'll ask you to go ahead and retell the story what we're trying to do here is explain how a background fact investigation work it's not the same thing as a full-blown FBI investigation where agents have subpoenas and can execute search warrants it's very limited and they have to take their direction from their client their client in this case being the White House and that's what gave the White House a lot of say over what could be done Trump saw the political pressure he saw others saying look this is a narrative thing and he says them again let the FBI do whatever they want let them rummage around and find whatever they want about Cavanaugh and McGann says look legally we can't do that we don't have we can't let the FBI run free and just dig through whatever it wants they have to be directed but what we will do is tell them on these particular issues we've asked them to look into accusations from three women they can interview whomever they want to this piece kind of paints McGann as reining in even his boss the president's desire to open this up yes the president it's interesting we've seen the president interact so many different ways with the Justice Department in this case he wants to use the FBI as a way of giving him political cover saying look I don't think they're gonna find anything let him take a look at whatever they want and began saying look we can't do that legally that's not possible we're far more constrained than that we can direct them to different issues we can have them check back with us and report back to us but we can't just say hey guys take a look at what's in the newspaper take a look at every lead you have and see what you see what you can come up with there was no evidence of a criminal a crime being committed at least in the eyes of the White House I think the Democrats would say that Cavanaugh had committed perjury but in the White House's eyes there was no criminal thing to be investigated and it was obviously a political thing something that that Coons and flake had created this seven-day short investigation final question and in asking it I'm thinking about a guy like Jeff Flake who has been so publicly tortured a brow that has been in furrow mode for days let's say your piece of journalism tonight is one of several that drop over the next 12 to 24 hours let's say the sum total is something less than a stellar effort by the White House DOJ FBI something just north of malpractice the vote hasn't taken place yet is it possible that journalism and and leaks could still affect the outcome I'm not sure what could affect the outcome at this point but what we do know is that in any investigation when you put an end time on it you're limiting what you can find and what you can really get to the bottom of there's a reason why when Bob Waller was appointed the Special Counsel he didn't come out and say hey I'll be done with my investigation in six months and a year an investigation if it's out to really find the facts has all the time and resources to go out and do that obviously this is a political thing hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
