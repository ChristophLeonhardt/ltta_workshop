the president is again calling for a government shutdown tweeting I would be willing to shut down the government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for border security which includes the wall the president wants five billion bucks and funding for that wall to finally begin the construction he is continually continuously claiming is underway but so far that's correct it's not underway but so far House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell haven't been willing to Ben Ryan said he hopes the president can be patient last week while hoping while McConnell said that except this when he was asked about a shutdown on Kentucky radio he is the funding of the border wall going to wait until after the midterm elections probably and that's something we do have a disagreement on and homeland security won't get funded before the midterm probably not but most of the government will be covered so you're not worried about a government shutdown because that's not going to happen the president says we need a wall at the southern border to stop immigrants he claims pour in and infest our country so for facts sake let's see what his own department his own Department of Homeland Security says about that situation at the border in government fiscal year 2016 there were just over five hundred and sixty three thousand apprehensions at the southern border by Customs and Border Patrol according to the agency's own data it had more than eighty two percent effectiveness rate in fiscal year 2016 beating its own target of eighty one percent that is eighty-two percent of people who are at the southern border stopped from illegally entering the country meanwhile DHS data shows there were nearly six hundred and thirty thousand in country visa overstays that same fiscal year those as you know are people who fly into the country and just don't leave that is almost sixty six thousand more people in the country unauthorized by simply flying in and staying than those crossing the southern border and that is something a wall absolutely will not stop and an example that the president and other pro wall Republicans have pointed out is Israel's wall along the Gaza Strip but that wall was along a border one-tenth of the size of our border with Mexico and it was coupled with policies aimed at making immigration less desirable like prohibiting immigrants from sending money out of the country and forcing employers to deposit 20% of immigrant employees pay into a bank account available when the employee leaves the country so unless the president wants to adopt similar policies which he has not advocated for or beefed up the Border Patrol any wall would cost billions of dollars and have very limited effectiveness the concept of stop the overstaying of visas I guess doesn't have the same ring to it as build that wall it doesn't but you build a wall and someone else is gonna build a higher ladder joining us now is NBC News senior editor politics Pat phooey Beth good to see you we were talking about this in the break what does it get the president to continue to carry on about this wall he's been fact-checked about it he's got all the voters who think they want somebody who's tough on crime on border immigration already he needs to broaden his base we're coming up 90 90 min term elections this doesn't seem like a great political strategy he may have those people but he hasn't gotten them committed to vote yet and as you guys know in midterms typically the the party that's in power in the White House loses seats right now we've got tons of prognosticators really smart ones including in our own Network saying that there is a making of a blue wave coming in November he's doing whatever he can to stop that and that includes getting his his voters as you identified already very Pro wall really revved up about immigration to actually get out of their homes and go vote in the midterms rather than staying home he sees that it's the only way to keep C so that is what Trump is doing but Trump isn't actually running Republicans across the country how do they feel about it because trunk for example loves to talk about tax cuts and how they benefit the American people yet when you trickle down to those states Republicans are not talking about the tax cuts and they're not talking about this wall yeah and even more importantly the most of the Republicans who are running or in competitive seats they're in 25 of them now that are running in seats that Hillary Clinton won so the Democrats only need 23 to retake the house they've got those 25 sitting right there in Hillary Clinton districts they do not want this discussion at all so while he's bringing out these bass voters who chances are living in pretty living a pretty safe Republican red districts these mixed districts where Hillary won this is not a good approach hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by
