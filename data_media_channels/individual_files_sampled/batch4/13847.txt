one of the great irritants I think one of the things that's helping to destroy comedy in the country is the feeling that there are certain areas of American life that used to be off-limits for politics where we didn't feel like we were gonna be assaulted based on our politics when we turned on our TV and we watched Johnny Carson Johnny Carson was studiously anti political meaning that he was a Democrat apparently he was not a Reagan panel but he got to know Reagan and ended up liking him Johnny Carson was a Democrat but you wouldn't know that from watching Johnny Carson Jay Leno was a sort of halfway Republican you wouldn't have known that from watching him because Jay Leno was studiously non-political now all of our late-night host have basically become political hacks and you can see that at work so last night Colbert Kimmel Fallon all of them are ardent leftist and all of them have decided and they need to go balls to the wall in pushing for gun control so here here's a mash-up of Colbert and Kimmel and Fallon here hear them talking about Trump's gun proposals with the Olympics over 90 countries have departed South Korea yep 90 groups waving goodbye or as the NRA calls those sponsors although gun owners if you go into almost any business and show them your gun you get stuff for free it's really here in reality there was an armed sheriff's deputy on site and it made no difference but Trump even has an explanation for that the reason a teacher with a handgun would be able to neutralize a shooter with an automatic weapon is because teachers love the kids more see this is what happens when we elect a president who thought paul blart mall cop was a documentary it would be ridiculous coming from anyone but especially from Trump he's gonna run in yo when Trump ran for president that was the first time he ran in his entire life okay so all the late night hosts universally talking about how stupid it is to talk about why good people with guns can stop bad people with guns of course this is idiocy Kimmel's point particularly is incredibly stupid first of all he says if the shooter had an automatic weapon the shooters did not have an automatic weapon people on the Left who are talking about this stuff should at least learn basic terminology so they don't sound so they don't sound like complete morons but they're not bothering to do that and it's evidence
