1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,140
Narrator: What makes these
shoes worth almost $800?

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,160
Christian Louboutin is the mastermind

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,410
behind these iconic red-bottomed shoes.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,810
It's safe to say his footwear

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,760
has stepped into the mainstream.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,570
Celebrities all over the world wear them.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,660
"You know the ones with the high heels

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,803
and the red bottoms?"

9
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:26,009
♪ These expensive, these is red bottoms ♪

10
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,670
♪ These is bloody shoes ♪

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,960
Narrator: Louboutin even had
the red bottoms trademarked.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,350
The signature Louboutin
pumps, start at $695.

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,510
The most expensive pair, nearly $6,000.

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,950
So how did this craze start?

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,410
Christian Louboutin had the
idea for red soles in 1993.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,190
An employee was painting her nails red.

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,730
Louboutin snagged the
bottle and painted the soles

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,720
of a prototype shoe.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,530
Just like that, the red soles were born.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,400
So, what makes these shoes worth the cost?

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,430
In 2013, when the New York
Times asked Louboutin,

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,519
why his shoes are so expensive,

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,750
he blamed production costs.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,690
Louboutin said, "It's expensive
to make shoes in Europe."

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,770
From 2008 to 2013, he said
his company's production costs

26
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,260
had doubled as the euro
strengthened against the dollar,

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,800
and competition increased
for quality materials

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
from factories in Asia.

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,650
David Mesquita, the
co-owner of Leather Spa,

30
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,670
says craftsmanship also plays a part

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,393
in the shoes' high price tag.

32
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,890
His company works directly with Louboutin

33
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,943
to repair its shoes, repainting
and replacing the red soles.

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,075
David Mesquita: I mean
there's a lot of things

35
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,175
that go into the design

36
00:01:40,175 --> 00:01:42,310
of a shoe, and the making of a shoe.

37
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,290
Most importantly, I think
is, who's designing it,

38
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,690
who's manufacturing it,
and also what materials

39
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,391
they're using to make the shoes.

40
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:52,140
Whether you're talking
about feathers, rhinestones,

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,860
or exotic materials, there's
so much attention to detail

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,413
that they put into their manufacturing and

43
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:58,785
designing of their shoes.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,500
Narrator: For instance,
these $3,595 Louboutins

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,023
are embellished with Swarovski Crystals.

46
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,620
And these raccoon fur boots cost $1,995.

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,400
When it all comes down to it,

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,190
people are paying for the status symbol.

49
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,960
Producer Spencer Alben bought a pair

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,730
of Louboutins for her wedding.

51
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,350
Spencer Alben: It makes
me sound so stuck up,

52
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,540
but I love the red soles

53
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,880
because it's such like
a fashion icon symbol.

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,780
There's something about them

55
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,030
that when you see them in a picture,

56
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,010
you instantly know what those are.

57
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,790
So it's like a status symbol I guess,

58
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,330
which makes me sound terrible.

59
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,020
They were over $1,000,
which when I say that now,

60
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,440
is insane for one pair of shoes

61
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,190
that you're probably
never gonna wear again.

62
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,240
It's like something that everyone knows,

63
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,180
so the second you see the red bottoms,

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,560
it's like, I know what those are,

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,880
I know what those cost.

66
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,830
And it's so superficial
that we care about that,

67
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,220
but it really is something
that is universal.

68
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,990
You see that and you
instantly know what those are,

69
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,440
and it's something special.

70
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,850
So I think, something as silly

71
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,540
as the color of the sole on the shoe,

72
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,250
makes them so special,

73
00:03:03,250 --> 00:00:00,000
because it's universally identifiable.
