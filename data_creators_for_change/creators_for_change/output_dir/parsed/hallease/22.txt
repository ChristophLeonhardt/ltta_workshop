-  Hey everyone.
I'm Hallease.
I'm a video producer
and digital storyteller
primarily on YouTube.
(funky music)
Welcome to my Patreon.
I tell digital stories
about my chaotic good life
and anything else I'm vibing.
And I do that through
documentary-style vlogs,
reviews and tutorials.
By joining my production team
here on Patreon,
you'll get early exclusive
and extended access
to my videos,
as well as monthly live streams
where we can chill together
and discuss videos that I've released,
or anything else you want to talk about.
I call y'all producers
because that's what you are.
You're helping me produce the channel
and everything that goes into that,
whether it be gear,
travel expenses,
crew costs,
or living expenses.
Thanks for stopping by
and I hope you join the production team.
