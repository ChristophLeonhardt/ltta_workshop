1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,169
My sisters and I were all on
the front porch watching this

2
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:12,520
green tank coming down
the street with the barrel up,

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,799
hitting the leaves and we were,
like, in awe with disbelief.

4
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:21,290
We heard gunshots,
we heard sirens, police,

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,240
cars running down the street.

6
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,280
We would see people running up and
down the street with TVs on their backs.

7
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:08,120
The riots started all the exodus
of white people, families, elderly blacks,

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,110
because everybody started moving out.

9
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,170
And this neighborhood was
the most beautiful neighborhood

10
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,140
I have ever seen in my life.
Everybody took care of their property.

11
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,270
It was so nice. We had 
the Drome bowling alley.

12
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,010
We had a furniture store, record stores.
We had a cleaners.

13
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,800
It will never be like I remembered it.
It will never be that again.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:00:00,000
They say that it's coming back,
but I don't see it.
