so if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the common</font>

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,220
interview the common negotiation that we

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,559
do we go into the room somebody says why

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,050
briefcase technique is something totally

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,510
different it's almost theatrical you

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,070
would say something like you know I did

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,840
a little bit of research and I know that

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,310
one of the biggest challenges for your

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,500
company as it grows is making sure you

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,050
maintain culture so actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared a</font>

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,630
few ideas well pull it out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,090
briefcase or your back and say here you

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">go no one has ever prepared like that</font>

17

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,510

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,460
telling the CEO what to do no you did

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,350
