Germany is commemorating one of its most famous and controversial thinkers Saturday is the 200th anniversary of the birth of the author of the Communist Manifesto Karl Marx to say that his ideas of class struggle and the overthrow of the ruling classes by the workers were and remain divisive here well that is beyond understatement Marx's ideas were literally at the root of the ideological division between East and West Germany post-world War two but that's not stopping his place of birth tria in the southwest from hosting a series of events to mark his big birthday bash it surprised many when it was announced that the guest of honor at the big party entry would be jean-claude juncker the EU Commission president hardly has proletariat credentials in fact the former prime minister of Luxembourg has been accused in the past of exuding the worst excesses of the bourgeoisie so perhaps mr. Jonker has been a closeted comrade of Marx all these years Karl Marx is not responsible for all the atrocities carried out by his followers his writings dust capital and the Communist Manifesto changed the world as we know it Marx's name and image has appeared all over the place from a major street here in the German capital for this t-shirt you can even save your capitalists pennies inside the head of one of communism founding thinkers Marx's also appeared in more than his fair share of TV shows and advertisements as well non materialistic and sweet will be on who on the English football Cup in 1949 he controls me the production the struggle of the urban proletariat no it was Wolverhampton Wanderers who read Leicester 3:1 oh my god but I have sweet here dad my son is a communist the ideas put forward by mark Singh here alongside Frederick angles haven't been consigned to the 19th or for that matter the 20th centuries a recent poll of people from 28 different nations showed that half of them said it to get a better society we should follow socialist ideals however it is worth noting that in the same poll around the same number said that political systems based on the writings of these two were far more likely to be oppressive I asked the people of Berlin what they thought those marks have a place in today's society and politics so when it comes to politics like maybe you use it to get votes but it's not really like that ideology in it of itself has never been practiced so it doesn't exist not only like about economic inequalities but also other types of inequalities that could be used they could they could use marxist theory to to be examined more in today's culture capitalism steals labor from its people seals labor from the workers and from from our point of view it's still important it's an idea a utopia in reality things in differently at Marx's funeral in London in 1883 angles said of his friend the greatest living thinker has ceased to think well that may well have been but 200 years after his birth the ideas put forward by Marx continue to inspire others to think Peter Oliver Artie Berlin earlier we spoke with philosophers logic about Karl Marx's legacy what we today perceive as so-called cultural Marxism all this phenomena like politically correctness the new leftist moralism Puritanism presenting much of feminism and so on is really if I may use old Marxist terms more a kind of old the bourgeois moralism masked as the left it's a political correctness if you ask me why Trump born is a reaction to it political correctness is the last liberal bourgeois defense against true emancipatory social and economic movement
