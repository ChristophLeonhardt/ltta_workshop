1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:02,936
THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE JUST 

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:03,736
MOMENTS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP 

3
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:04,771
MADE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT ON 

4
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,037
TRADE. 

5
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:05,839
YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT GETTING 

6
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,408
READY TO SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE. 

7
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,108
LET'S DIP IN. 

8
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:19,185
THE FOCUS IS NAFTA. 

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,920
>> THIS HAS TO DO, THEY USED TO 

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,854
CALL IT NAFTA. 

11
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,323
WE ARE GOING TO CALL IT THE 

12
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,257
UNITED STATES-MEXICO TRADE 

13
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:24,557
AGREEMENT. 

14
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,992
WE WILL GET RID OF THE NAME 

15
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:26,225
NAFTA. 

16
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:30,063
HAS A BAD CONNOTATION. 

17
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,432
NOW IT IS A REALLY GOOD DEAL 

18
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,133
FOR BOTH COUNTRIES, AND WE LOOK 

19
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,301
VERY MUCH FORWARD TO IT. 

20
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:41,141
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS ON 

21
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,477
THE PHONE. 

22
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:49,883
HENRIQUE? 

23
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,620
YOU CAN HOOK THEM UP. 

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:02,462
YOU TELL ME WHEN. 

25
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,029
IT'S A BIG THING. 

26
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:14,908
A LOT OF PEOPLE WAITING. 

27
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,141
HELLO? 

28
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:21,147
YOU WANT TO PUT THAT ON THIS 

29
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:21,480
PHONE PLEASE? 

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,384
HELLO. 

31
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:38,731
THAT BE HELPFUL. 

32
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:46,539
THANK YOU. 

33
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,841
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOW ARE 

34
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,274
YOU, GOOD MORNING. 

35
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:48,808
>> THANK YOU. 

36
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:49,208
CONGRATULATIONS. 

37
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:49,976
IT'S REALLY A FANTASTIC THING. 

38
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,012
WE HAVE ALL WORKED REALLY HARD. 

39
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:53,646
YOUR BRILLIANT REPRESENTATIVES 

40
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,981
ARE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF 

41
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,516
ME, AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD 

42
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,183
CONGRATULATE EACH OTHER BEFORE 

43
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,218
IT GOT OUT, AND I KNOW WE WILL 

44
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:00,586
HAVE A FORMAL NEWS CONFERENCE 

45
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:03,056
IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE 

46
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:03,489
-- DISTANT FUTURE. 

47
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:09,195
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 

48
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:09,627
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

49
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:13,032
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING VERY 

50
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:18,871
POSITIVE FOR THE UNITED STATES 

51
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:32,151
AND MEXICO. THE FIRST REASON 

52
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:32,785
FOR THIS CALL, MR. PRESIDENT, 

53
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,087
IS, FIRST OF ALL, TO CELEBRATE 

54
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:34,687
THE UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE 

55
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:42,362
BETWEEN BOTH NEGOTIATING TEAMS 

56
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:47,233
ON NAFTA. THIS IS INTEREST WE 

57
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:52,071
HAVE HAD FOR QUITE A FEW MONTHS 

58
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,339
NOW TO RENEW IT, TO MODERNIZE 

59
00:02:53,339 --> 00:03:00,880
IT, TWO UPDATE IT, AND TO 

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,253
GENERATE A FRAMEWORK THAT WILL 

61
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:15,128
CREATE PRODUCTIVITY IN NORTH 

62
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,931
AMERICA. 

63
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,599
IT IS OUR WISH, MR. PRESIDENT, 

64
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,903
THAT NOW CANADA WILL ULTIMATELY 

65
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:29,909
WANT TO BE INCORPORATED IN ALL 

66
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:37,951
OF THIS. 

67
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,386
AND I ASSUME THAT WE ARE GOING 

68
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,555
TO CARRY OUT NEGOTIATIONS OF 

69
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,191
THE SENSITIVE BILATERAL ISSUES 

70
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,392
BETWEEN MEXICO -- RATHER, 

71
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:52,432
BETWEEN CANADA AND THE UNITED 

72
00:03:52,432 --> 00:04:02,041
STATES. 

73
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,841
I AM REALLY GRATEFUL, MR. 

74
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:03,141
PRESIDENT. 

75
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:04,510
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I 

76
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,347
GREATLY RECOGNIZE AND 

77
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,014
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR POLITICAL WILL 

78
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:20,159
AND YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS. 

79
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,963
AND ON THE SAME PATH, I WANT TO 

80
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,731
BEAR MY TESTIMONY, MR. 

81
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,865
PRESIDENT, AND MY 

82
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:32,372
ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO BOTH 

83
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,039
NEGOTIATING TEAMS, ESPECIALLY 

84
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,376
THE TEAM THAT IS HEADED AND LED 

85
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:44,584
BY MR. ROBERT, AND ALSO THE 

86
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,686
ACCOMPANIMENT AND THE SUPPORT 

87
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:53,593
FROM THE HOUSE THROUGH JARED 

88
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:53,860
KUSHNER. 

89
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,762
AND I ALSO EXTEND THIS 

90
00:04:55,762 --> 00:05:02,435
RECOGNITION TO THE MEXICAN TEAMS

91
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:14,647
. WE ARE LISTENING TO YOU. 

92
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,881
THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND THE 

93
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:24,424
SECRETARY OF THE CURRENT 

94
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:57,990
MINISTER. 

95
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,158
THIS IS, OF COURSE, A 

96
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,126
NEGOTIATION THAT HAS TAKEN 

97
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:00,359
MONTHS. 

98
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,127
IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT. 

99
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,295
IT'S A VERY HARD NEGOTIATION 

100
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,096
ALTOGETHER WITH DIFFICULT 

101
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,332
MOMENTS, OF COURSE, BUT I TRULY 

102
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,099
ACKNOWLEDGE NOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE 

103
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:12,972
TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WE 

104
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,207
ARE ABOUT TO MAKE PUBLIC, AND 

105
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,674
THIS IS THE RESULT OF GOOD 

106
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,411
UNDERSTANDING AND GOOD WORK, 

107
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,579
AND I, OF COURSE, AND QUITE 

108
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,080
HOPEFUL THAT NOW CANADA WILL 

109
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,081
START DISCUSSING WITH THE 

110
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:27,453
UNITED STATES THE SENSITIVE 

111
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,488
BILATERAL ISSUES. 

112
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:39,165
CONGRATULATIONS. I AM VERY 

113
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,299
GRATEFUL AND I AM ATTENTIVE TO 

114
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:40,666
YOUR COMMENTS. 

115
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,701
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU 

116
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,201
VERY MUCH. 

117
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:42,668
IT'S AN HONOR. 

118
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:48,007
YOU HAVE BEEN MY FRIEND. 

119
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,742
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE 

120
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,943
I'VE TRAVELED TO MEXICO WHERE 

121
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,645
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER QUITE 

122
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,247
WELL, AND WE ACTUALLY HAD A 

123
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:54,580
GOOD MEETING. 

124
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,948
SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T SURE IF IT 

125
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,383
WAS A GOOD MEETING, BUT I WAS. 

126
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,151
I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MEETINGS 

127
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,853
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T 

128
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,288
SURE IF THEY WERE GOOD OR NOT. 

129
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,890
BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, AND 

130
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,157
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY 

131
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:06,225
SPECIAL FOR OUR MANUFACTURERS 

132
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,059
AND FOR OUR FARMERS. 

133
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,628
ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR 

134
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,795
JOBS, IT'S ALSO GREAT TRADE. 

135
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,597
IT MAKES IT A MUCH MORE FAIR 

136
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,798
BILL, AND WE ARE VERY, VERY 

137
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:21,374
EXCITED ABOUT THAT. 

138
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,808
WE HAVE WORKED WANT -- WORKED 

139
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:23,643
LONG AND HARD. 

140
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,343
YOUR REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN 

141
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:24,610
TERRIFIC. 

142
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,378
MY REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN 

143
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:25,878
FANTASTIC, TOO. 

144
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,846
THEY'VE GOTTEN ALONG VERY WELL 

145
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,281
AND THEY WORKED LATE INTO THE 

146
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:28,681
NIGHT FOR MONTHS. 

147
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,882
AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX BILL, AND 

148
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:34,220
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE 

149
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,788
WILL TALK ABOUT FOR MANY YEARS 

150
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,088
TO COME. 

151
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,125
JUST GOOD FOR BOTH COUNTRIES. 

152
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,393
AS FAR AS CANADA IS CONCERNED, 

153
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:42,662
WE HAVEN'T STARTED WITH CANADA 

154
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:42,929
YET. 

155
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,530
WE WANTED TO DO MEXICO AND SEE 

156
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,100
IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE TO DO, AND 

157
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,735
I THINK IT WASN'T FROM ANY 

158
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:50,470
STANDPOINT SOMETHING THAT MOST 

159
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,173
PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS EVEN DOABLE 

160
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,908
WHEN WE STARTED, IF YOU LOOK AT 

161
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:56,074
IT. 

162
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,176
YOU REMEMBER AT THE BEGINNING 

163
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,511
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THIS 

164
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,378
WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST 

165
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,646
COULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE OF ALL 

166
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,950
THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS, ALL THE 

167
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,850
DIFFERENT SIDES, AND THE 

168
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,150
COMPLEXITY. 

169
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,452
WE MADE IT MUCH SIMPLER, MUCH 

170
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,920
BETTER, MUCH BETTER FOR BOTH 

171
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,220
COUNTRIES. 

172
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,688
CANADA WILL START NEGOTIATIONS 

173
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:12,425
SHORTLY. 

174
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,161
I'LL BE CALLING THE PRIME 

175
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,029
MINISTER VERY SOON AND WE WILL 

176
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,462
START NEGOTIATIONS. 

177
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:23,302
IF THEY LIKE TO NEGOTIATE 

178
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,837
FAIRLY, WE WILL DO THAT. 

179
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,105
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE TARIFFS OF 

180
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,573
ALMOST 300% ON SOME OF OUR 

181
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,008
DAIRY PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN'T 

182
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,308
HAVE THAT. 

183
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,810
WE ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR 

184
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,010
THAT. 

185
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,043
I THINK WITH CANADA, FRANKLY, 

186
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,379
THE EASIEST THING WE COULD DO 

187
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:39,051
IS TO TERRACE THEIR CARS COMING 

188
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:39,217
IN. 

189
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:40,385
IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 

190
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,821
MONEY AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE 

191
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,188
NEGOTIATION. 

192
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,023
IT COULD END IN ONE DAY AND WE 

193
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,892
TAKE IN A LOT OF MONEY THE 

194
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:46,259
FOLLOWING DAY. 

195
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,927
BUT I THINK WE WILL GIVE THEM 

196
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,262
THE CHANCE TO PROBABLY HAVE A 

197
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:49,629
SEPARATE DEAL. 

198
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,030
WE COULD HAVE A SEPARATE DEAL 

199
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,732
THAT WE COULD PUT IT INTO THIS 

200
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:52,965
DEAL. 

201
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,299
I LIKE TO CALL THIS DEAL UNITED 

202
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,701
STATES-MEXICO TRADE AGREEMENT. 

203
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,836
I THINK IT'S AN ELEGANT NAME. 

204
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,504
I THINK NAFTA HAS A LOT OF BAD 

205
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,705
CONNOTATIONS FOR THE UNITED 

206
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,839
STATES BECAUSE IT WAS A RIPOFF. 

207
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,308
IT WAS A DEAL THAT WAS A 

208
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,476
HORRIBLE DEAL FOR OUR COUNTRY. 

209
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,379
I THINK IT'S GOT A LOT OF BAD 

210
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,513
CONNOTATIONS TO A LOT OF 

211
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,216
PEOPLE, AND SO WE WILL -- 

212
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,617
PROBABLY YOU AND I WILL AGREE 

213
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,118
TO THE NAME. 

214
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,753
WE WILL SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE 

215
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,124
DECIDE TO PUT UP CANADA OR JUST 

216
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,725
DO A SEPARATE DEAL WITH CANADA 

217
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,394
IF THEY WANT TO MAKE THE DEAL 

218
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,561
THE SIMPLEST DEAL IS MORE OR 

219
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,929
LESS ALREADY MADE AND VERY EASY 

220
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:26,031
TO DO AND EXECUTE. 

221
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,233
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT 

222
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,035
WORKING WITH YOU HAS BEEN A 

223
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:29,302
PLEASURE. 

224
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,637
SPEAKING WITH AND WORKING WITH 

225
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:35,174
PRESIDENT-ELECT LOPEZ HAS BEEN 

226
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:40,813
ABSOLUTELY A VERY, VERY SPECIAL 

227
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,013
TIME. 

228
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,414
YOU BOTH CAME TOGETHER FOR YOUR 

229
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:42,882
COUNTRY. 

230
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,315
YOU WORK TOGETHER. 

231
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:44,350
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR 

232
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,985
THE MEDIA TO KNOW WE HAVE A 

233
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:51,957
SMALL AMOUNT OF MEDIA IN OUR 

234
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:53,826
PRESENCE LIKE EVERYBODY. 

235
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,561
THE MEDIA SHOULD KNOW THAT THE 

236
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,395
PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT 

237
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,329
ELECT WORKED VERY CLOSELY 

238
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,130
TOGETHER BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT 

239
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,232
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT THE 

240
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,367
PRESIDENT-ELECT LIKED WHAT HE 

241
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:08,474
WAS SEEING AND OUR TEAMS WORK 

242
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:08,741
TOGETHER. 

243
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,909
OUR TEAMS WERE REALLY WELL 

244
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,544
UNIFIED, AND YOUR TEAM WAS VERY 

245
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:11,877
WELL UNIFIED. 

246
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:12,878
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE 

247
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,013
FACT THAT THE TWO PRESIDENTS 

248
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:20,386
CAME TOGETHER AND WORKED OUT 

249
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,087
SOMETHING MUTUALLY AGREEABLE. 

250
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,288
SO IT'S AN INCREDIBLE DEAL. 

251
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,456
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE DEAL FOR 

252
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:23,856
BOTH PARTIES. 

253
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,924
MOST IMPORTANT, IT'S AN 

254
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,891
INCREDIBLE DEAL FOR THE WORKERS 

255
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,193
AND FOR THE CITIZENS OF BOTH 

256
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:27,493
COUNTRIES. 

257
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,262
OUR FARMERS ARE GOING TO BE SO 

258
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:30,495
HAPPY. 

259
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,696
THE FARMERS HAVE STUCK WITH ME. 

260
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:34,133
I SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO 

261
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:34,333
THIS. 

262
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,402
MEXICO HAS PROMISED TO 

263
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,637
IMMEDIATELY START PURCHASING AS 

264
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,972
MUCH FARM PRODUCT AS THEY CAN. 

265
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,674
THEY ARE GOING TO WORK ON THAT 

266
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:41,974
VERY HARD. 

267
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,911
AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE WORKING -- 

268
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,179
UNRELATED TO THIS, WE ARE 

269
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,481
WORKING VERY MUCH WITH OTHER 

270
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:48,781
COUNTRIES. 

271
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,785
CHINA IS ONE. 

272
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,719
THEY WANT TO TALK. 

273
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,354
IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO 

274
00:10:55,354 --> 00:11:01,460
TALK RIGHT NOW, TO BE HONEST. 

275
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,429
IT'S TOO ONE-SIDED FOR TOO MANY 

276
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,496
YEARS AND TOO MANY DECADES. 

277
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,265
SO IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO 

278
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,466
TALK, BUT EVENTUALLY I'M SURE 

279
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,368
WE ARE ABLE TO WORK OUT A DEAL 

280
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:09,768
WITH CHINA. 

281
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,237
IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE DOING 

282
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:11,970
VERY WELL WITH CHINA. 

283
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,805
OUR ECONOMY IS UP. 

284
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,873
IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS GOOD 

285
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,274
BEFORE, AND I THINK IT'S ONLY 

286
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:15,941
GOING TO GET BETTER. 

287
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,109
BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'VE BEEN 

288
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,511
MY FRIEND AND YOU HAVE BEEN 

289
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,512
SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN VERY 

290
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,180
SPECIAL IN A LOT OF WAYS. 

291
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,948
WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS DEAL 

292
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,016
AND I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE 

293
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,520
YOU AND THE MEXICAN PEOPLE. 

294
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,259
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 

295
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:33,959
PRESIDENT. 

296
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,597
I RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE NOW 

297
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:48,374
REACHING ON THIS DEAL. 

298
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,611
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THE PART 

299
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,746
WITH CANADA WILL BE 

300
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:59,251
MATERIALIZING IN A VERY QUICK 

301
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,986
FASHION. 

302
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:15,167
THAT WE CAN HAVE AN AGREEMENT. 

303
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,270
BUT TODAY I CELEBRATE THE 

304
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,942
UNITED STATES AND MEXICO, 

305
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:28,380
BECAUSE WE ARE REACHING A FINAL 

306
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:38,724
UNDERSTANDING, AND I HOPE THAT 

307
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,360
IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS WE CAN 

308
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,328
MATERIALIZE SOMETHING IN THE 

309
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,232
FORMALIZATION OF THIS 

310
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,500
AGREEMENT, SOMETHING 

311
00:12:48,500 --> 00:13:01,146
ADDITIONAL, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 

312
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:02,081
HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IT. 

313
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:07,453
IT HAS TO DO WITH PARTICIPATION 

314
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,119
OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE 

315
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:13,993
PRESIDENT-ELECT OF MEXICO. 

316
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,428
AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOW GOING 

317
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:25,404
THROUGH A TRANSITION, AND IT 

318
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,538
HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO CREATE A 

319
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:29,508
HIGHLY UNIFIED FRONT BETWEEN 

320
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:35,714
THE NEGOTIATING TEAM OF THIS 

321
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,151
ADMINISTRATION, THE PEOPLE 

322
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:39,918
APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT-

323
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:52,965

UNDERSTANDING TO REACH THIS 

326
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:12,985
TIME WE ARE NOW REACHING. 

327
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,954
PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS BEEN AWARE 

328
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,222
OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN 

329
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:20,492
HAPPENING, AND I AM ALSO HAVING 

330
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,593
THE OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING HIM 

331
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:24,430
DIRECTLY AND PERSONALLY ON THE 

332
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,800
PROGRESS BEING MADE. 

333
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,169
YOU HAVE ALSO HAD DIRECT 

334
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:36,375
CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENT-

335
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,144
ELECT. 

336
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:45,517
I HOPE WE HAVE THE SPACE TO DO 

337
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:52,257
IT, TO A GOOD TOAST WITH 

338
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:56,428
TEQUILA, OF COURSE, TO 

339
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,263
CELEBRATE THIS UNDERSTANDING. 

340
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,597
>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY 

341
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,798
RIGHT, AND YOU KNOW THE GOOD 

342
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,634
RELATIONSHIP THAT I'VE ALREADY 

343
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,267
ESTABLISHED WITH THE PRESIDENT-

344
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:02,501
ELECT. 

345
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,502
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIM, 

346
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,402
I MUST TELL YOU. 

347
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:08,073
HE WAS TERRIFIC IN EVERY WAY. 

348
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,141
HE LOVES YOUR COUNTRY LIKE YOU 

349
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,109
LOVE YOUR COUNTRY. 

350
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,543
YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 

351
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,678
WE ARE REALLY DOING THE RIGHT 

352
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,080
THING FOR ALL OF US, SO I 

353
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,681
REALLY ENJOYED THAT. 

354
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:25,124
PLEASE SEND HIM MY REGARDS. I 

355
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,692
WILL SPEAK TO HIM VERY SHORTLY, 

356
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,427
BUT THIS WAS GREAT THAT YOU ARE 

357
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,561
ABLE TO DO IT TOGETHER. 

358
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,063
I THINK DOING IT MUTUALLY AS 

359
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,531
OPPOSED TO JUST YOU DOING IT, 

360
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,667
OR EVEN JUST HIM DOING IT, I 

361
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,367
THINK A MUTUAL AGREEMENT 

362
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:35,968
BETWEEN YOUR TWO 

363
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:36,835
ADMINISTRATIONS WAS A FANTASTIC 

364
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:37,068
THING. 

365
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,437
I SUGGESTED THAT EARLY ON, AND 

366
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,838
I THINK IT WAS IMMEDIATELY 

367
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,306
EMBRACED AND I THINK IT WAS A 

368
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,441
REALLY FANTASTIC THING THAT YOU 

369
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,575
WERE ABLE TO DO IT. 

370
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,077
AND WITH GREAT SPIRIT. 

371
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,211
IT WAS GREAT COORDINATION AND 

372
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:46,444
SPIRIT. 

373
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:47,913
I THINK THAT IS REALLY JUST 

374
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,146
GREAT. 

375
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:53,919
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M 

376
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,455
EXCITED ABOUT IS YOU ARE GOING 

377
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,923
TO BE HELPING US AT THE BORDER. 

378
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:58,991
YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING 

379
00:15:58,991 --> 00:15:59,825
TOGETHER WITH US ON 

380
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,158
AGRICULTURE. 

381
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,293
YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING IN 

382
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,694
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, AND WE ARE 

383
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:05,197
GOING TO BE WORKING WITH YOU IN

00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:05,664
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. 

385
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,298
IT'S A VERY COMPREHENSIVE 

386
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:06,598
AGREEMENT. 

387
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,433
I WILL SEE YOU SOON. 

388
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,201
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A 

389
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,636
VERY FORMAL CEREMONY. 

390
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,936
THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST 

391
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,305
TRADE DEALS EVER MADE, MAYBE 

392
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,041
THE LARGEST TRADE DEAL EVER 

393
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,342
MADE, AND IT'S REALLY SOMETHING 

394
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:18,377
VERY SPECIAL THAT TWO COUNTRIES 

395
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,878
WERE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AND 

396
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,947
GET IT DONE, AND I JUST WANT TO 

397
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:22,814
THANK ALL OF MY PEOPLE. 

398
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:27,653
BOB AND JARED AND, GENTLEMEN, 

399
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,121

I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN GOING TILL

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

407
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,868
I CAN SAY THAT MEXICO IS VERY 

408
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:43,335
PROUD OF YOU. 

409
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,536
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU. 

410
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,171

JOB WELL DONE. 

415
00:16:52,478 --> 00:17:12,131
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

416
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,231
WE WILL BE WAITING FOR CANADA 

417
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:19,037
TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THIS 

418
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:22,741
PROCESS. 

419
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,208
MY REGARDS. 

420
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,010
>> A HUG FROM YOU WOULD BE VERY 

421
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,279
NICE. 

422
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,815
THANK YOU. 

423
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,484
SO LONG. 

424
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,118
THANKS. 

425
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:33,318
OKAY. 

426
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,653
SO WE HAVE MADE THE DEAL WITH 

427
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,521
CANADA. 

428
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:40,392
IT'S A VERY -- SORRY, WE MADE 

429
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,660
THE DEAL WITH MEXICO, AND I 

430
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,494
THINK IT'S A GREAT DEAL. 

431
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,697
WE ARE STARTING NEGOTIATIONS 

432
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,431
WITH CANADA PRETTY MUCH 

433
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:46,764
IMMEDIATELY. 

434
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:55,040
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE THOSE 

435
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,941
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE GONE. 

436
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,209
IT'S A SMALLER SEGMENT, AS YOU 

437
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:57,409
KNOW. 

438
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,677
MEXICO IS A VERY LARGE TRADING 

439
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,678
PARTNER, BUT WE HAVE NOW 

440
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,114
CONCLUDED OUR DEAL, AND IT'S 

441
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,381
BEING FINALIZED AND, BOB, WHEN 

442
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,984
WOULD YOU SAY IT WOULD BE 

443
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,217
SIGNED? 

444
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:07,519
>> WELL, IT WOULD LIKELY BE 

445
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,957
SIGNED AT THE END OF NOVEMBER. 

446
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,425
IT MIGHT BE A DAY LAYOVER 

447
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,693
BECAUSE OF OUR STAFF, BUT WE 

448
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,195
EXPECT TO SEE THAT OUR LETTER 

449
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:22,134
TO CONGRESS BEGINNING THAT úPRO 

450
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,201
90 DAYS LATER IT WILL BE 

451
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:23,435
SIGNED. 

452
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,404
>> WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WHERE, 

453
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,772
BOTH WITH CANADA AND WITH 

454
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:31,543
MEXICO, I WILL TERMINATE THE 

455
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:31,910
EXISTING DEAL. 

456
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,278
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I CAN'T 

457
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:39,418
QUITE TELL YOU. IT DEPENDS ON 

458
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,786
WHAT THE TIMETABLE IS WITH 

459
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,054
CONGRESS, BUT I WILL BE 

460
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,088
TERMINATING THE EXISTING DEAL 

461
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,223
AND GOING INTO THIS DEAL. 

462
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,057
WE WILL START NEGOTIATING WITH 

463
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:45,757
CANADA RELATIVELY SOON. 

464
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,159
THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE VERY 

465
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,195
BADLY, BUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 

466
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:55,767
WE WILL HAVE A DEAL WITH 

467
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:56,000
CANADA. 

468
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,002
IT WILL BE A TERRORIST OR 

469
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:57,402
NEGOTIATED DEAL. 

470
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:05,444
FRANKLY, A TARIFF IS A MUCH 

471
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,945
EASIER WAY TO GO, BUT PERHAPS 

472
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,480
THE OTHER WOULD BE EASIER FOR 

473
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:08,914
CANADA. 

474
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,015
WE ARE LOOKING TO HELP OUR 

475
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:10,382
NEIGHBORS, TOO. 

476
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,850
IF WE CAN HELP OUR NEIGHBORS, 

477
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,518
THAT'S A GOOD THING, NOT A BAD 

478
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:13,785
THING. 

479
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,354
SO WE ARE GOING TO START THE 

480
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:15,854
NEGOTIATION IMMINENTLY. 

481
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:16,888
I WILL BE SPEAKING WITH PRIME 

482
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:18,423
MINISTER TRUDEAU IN A LITTLE 

483
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:18,656
WHILE. 

484
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:19,891
SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. 

485
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:20,725
I WANT TO THANK YOU. 

486
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,427
WHAT A GREAT JOB YOU HAVE ALL 

487
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:27,566
DONE, AND IT HAS BEEN A LONG 

488
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,101
ONE, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

489
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,469
THOUGHT THIS WAS NOT A DOABLE 

490
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:30,802
TRANSACTION. 

491
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:36,641
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR OUR 

492
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:40,379
PEOPLE. AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK 

493
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,014
YOU FOLKS, AND WE WILL SEE YOU 

494
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,715
AT THE SIGNING AND WE WILL SEE 

495
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,816
MANY TIMES BEFORE THAT I'M 

496
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,217
SURE. 

497
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:45,784
SO CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 

498
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,652
PEOPLE OF MEXICO. 

499
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:46,952
GREAT JOB. 

500
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:47,619
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 

501
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,352
>> MR. PRESIDENT, ANY THOUGHTS 

502
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:49,221
ON JOHN McCAIN? 

503
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,657
ANY THOUGHTS ON JOHN McCAIN, 

504
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,090
SIR? 

505
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,590
>> THANKS, EVERYBODY. 

506
00:19:52,590 --> 00:20:00,432
LET'S GO THIS WAY. 

507
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,000
>> SO WE HAVE JUST BEEN 

508
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,634
LISTENING TO PRESIDENT DONALD 

509
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:07,806
TRUMP AND MEXICAN PRESIDENT ON 

510
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,106
THE PHONE. 

511
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,041
HE'S THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT 

512
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:15,447
TALKING ABOUT A NEW DEAL, 

513
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,548
BILATERAL TRADE DEAL THAT THE 

514
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,449
TWO COUNTRIES HAVE HAMMERED 

515
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:17,649
OUT. 

516
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,750
YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT THE 

517
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,385
PRESIDENT, ONE OF THE THINGS HE 

518
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,953
CAMPAIGNED ON WAS REVISING 

519
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:22,186
NAFTA. 

520
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:23,455
NOW, THIS WASN'T A REVISION OF 

521
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,589
NAFTA BECAUSE THAT WOULD ALSO 

522
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,425
HAVE TO INCLUDE CANADA, BUT IT 

523
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,294
WAS A SEPARATE DEAL WITH 

524
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:35,467
MEXICO, AND IF YOU HEARD ON THE 

525
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:40,272
PHONE THAT HE WOULD ENCOURAGE 

526
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,573
CANADA BECAUSE CANADA HAD 

527
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:46,178
STEPPED AWAY FROM ANY SORT OF 

528
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,379
REVISION NO GO SHE ADDITIONS. 

529
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,213
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN 

530
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:48,814
TALKING ABOUT. 

531
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:53,118
THE FOCUS IS PRIMARILY ON THE 

532
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,353
AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AND METAL 

533
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,353
GOODS, ALUMINUM, STEEL, AND THE 

534
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:57,189
ISSUE WITH THAT INDUSTRY IN 

535
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:05,931
PARTICULAR IS A SUPPLY CHAIN IS 

536
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,999
INTEGRATED THROUGHOUT ALL THREE 

537
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,100
COUNTRIES, SO IT'S VERY 

538
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,435
IMPORTANT THAT ALL THREE 

539
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,403
COUNTRIES AGREE ON TARIFFS AND 

540
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,437
ON THINGS MOVING FORWARD. 

541
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,840
CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 

542
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,941
CORRESPONDENT WE SHOULD JANG 

543
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:22,013
JOINED ME NOW WITH MORE ON THE 

544
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:23,148
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS. 

545
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,750
SO THIS IS NOT A REVISION OF 

546
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:24,983
NAFTA. 

547
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,119
THE PRESIDENT COULDN'T DO THAT 

548
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,986
WITHOUT CANADA AND WITHOUT 

549
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:28,519
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL. 

550
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:32,424
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BRAND-NEW 

551
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,159
DEAL WITH MEXICO. 

552
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:34,426
>> RIGHT. 

553
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,494
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BILATERAL 

554
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,795
DEAL WITH MEXICO, AND THE 

555
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,696
PRESIDENT SET THE STAGE FOR 

556
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,030
THAT WHEN HE TWEETED THIS 

557
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,399
MORNING, A BIG DEAL LOOKING 

558
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:40,799
GOOD WITH MEXICO. 

559
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,070
AT THAT TIME, BEFORE THIS 

560
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,837
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE 

561
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,940
OVAL OFFICE, THE ASSUMPTION WAS 

562
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,342
THAT MEXICO AND THE U.S. WERE 

563
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,343
GOING TO HASH OUT THEIR 

564
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,079
DISAGREEMENTS AND THAT WOULD 

565
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,081
ALLOW CANADA TO COME BACK TO 

566
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,182
THE TABLE BECAUSE JUST FRIDAY 

567
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,250
THE CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 

568
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,385
SAID THAT CANADA WOULD BE HAPPY 

569
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,922
TO REJOIN THE TALKS ONCE THE 

570
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,890
U.S. AND MEXICO WORKED OUT 

571
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,795
THEIR ISSUES, SO THAT WAS THIS 

572
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:11,163
MORNING. 

573
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,397
HERE WE ARE NOW WITH THE 

574
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,932
PRESIDENT SAYING HE WANTS TO 

575
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,801
GET RID OF THE NAME NAFTA 

576
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:16,401
BECAUSE IT HAS NEGATIVE 

577
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:22,441
CONNOTATIONS WITH IT. 

578
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,875
NOW, EVEN THOUGH THAT'S THE 

579
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,410
NAME OF THIS AGREEMENT, HE ALSO 

580
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,611
SAYS CANADA IS WELCOME TO JOIN 

581
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,179
IT. 

582
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,114
PERHAPS THEY WOULD BRING IN THE 

583
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,415
NAME CANADA AS WELL BUT THE 

584
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,750
PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR THIS 

585
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,051
IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM 

586
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:33,284
NAFTA. 

587
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:34,019
AS YOU POINTED OUT, THE THREE-

588
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,521
WAY TALKS ALREADY DISSOLVED 

589
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,425
EARLIER THIS SUMMER, AND THEY 

590
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,359
REALLY IMPLODED WHEN VICE 

591
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,427
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE SAID THAT 

592
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,296
THERE HAD TO BE A SUNSET CLAUSE 

593
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,330
IN A NEW NAFTA DEAL. 

594
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,264
NOW, THAT MEANS THAT, 

595
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:46,965
ESSENTIALLY, THE AGREEMENT 

596
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,500
WOULD EXPIRE ON ITS OWN IN FIVE 

597
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,403
YEARS AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF 

598
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:56,241
CANADA SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT. 

599
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,676
THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTINUE 

600
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,010
THESE TALKS BECAUSE WE WILL NOT 

601
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,781
AGREE TO SUCH A CLAUSE. 

602
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:04,883
AT THAT TIME THE PRESIDENT 

603
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,117
REALLY STARTED FOCUSING ON 

604
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:06,885
THESE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH 

605
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:11,323
MEXICO AND WITH CANADA, AND 

606
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,924
THAT SORT OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT 

607
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,124
NOW. 

608
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,493
HE SAYS THAT HE'S REACHED THIS 

609
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,527
DEAL WITH MEXICO AND NOW HE 

610
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,528
WILL START NEGOTIATIONS WITH 

611
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:16,761
CANADA. 

612
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:17,896
AS YOU ALSO POINTED OUT, THE 

613
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,166
PRESIDENT OF MEXICO HAS A VERY 

614
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,400
DIFFERENT TONE ON THE PHONE 

615
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,135
THAT WE JUST HEARD HIM ON 

616
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:25,737
SPEAKERPHONE IN THE OVAL 

617
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,271
OFFICE. 

618
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,240
>> HE SAID HE WANTED TO GIVE 

619
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,807
THE PRESIDENT A HUG. 

620
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,774
>> HE DID SAY THAT. 

621
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:30,942
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WOULD 

622
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:35,880
LOVE ONE FROM HIM AS WELL. 

623
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,482
IN TERMS OF THEIR TONE TOWARD 

624
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:41,953
CANADA, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT 

625
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,087
REALLY LAID OUT THREE OPTIONS 

626
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:44,122
FOR THE PRIME MINISTER. 

627
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,389
YOU CAN EITHER HAVE A BILATERAL 

628
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,393
DEAL WITH US, YOU CAN COME JOIN 

629
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,128
THE STEEL, OR WE CAN TAX ALL OF 

630
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:54,165
YOUR CARS WITH TERRORISTS. 

631
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:55,467
NOW, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S 

632
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,101
VERY WELCOMING, ENCOURAGING 

633
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:56,334
CANADA. 

634
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,068
HE TWEETED THAT HE REALLY HOPES 

635
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:00,338
THAT JUSTIN TRUDEAU WILL JOIN 

636
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,374
AND THAT HE EVEN CALLED HIM 

637
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,308
THIS MORNING AFTER THIS 

638
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,578
ANNOUNCEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. 

639
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:06,878
AND MEXICO. 

640
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:12,683
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT WHAT WE 

641
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:14,152
EXPECTED, RIGHT? 

642
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,186
WE EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD 

643
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:16,955
JUST SORT OF AGREE TO TAKE ONE 

644
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,390
STEP FORWARD AGAIN SO THEY CAN 

645
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,724
FOCUS ON NAFTA, BUT CANADA ALSO 

646
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,024
RESPONDED. 

647
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:21,259
I SHOULD MENTION THAT THEY 

648
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,062
DELIVER THIS STATEMENT TO US 

649
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:24,962
BEFORE THE OVAL OFFICE 

650
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,164
ANNOUNCEMENT, AND THEY SAID 

651
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:26,998
THAT THEY ARE ENCOURAGED BY 

652
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,066
CONTINUED OPTIMISM THAT IS 

653
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,303
SHOWN BY OUR NEGOTIATING 

654
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,203
PARTNERS, BUT THEY MENTIONED 

655
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:34,472
MANY TIMES IN THIS STATEMENT 

656
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,640
THAT THEY WANTED TO WORK TOWARD 

657
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,144
A NEW NAFTA AGREEMENT, SO THEY 

658
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,412
ARE STILL CALLING IT NAFTA. 

659
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:44,149
THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, THEY WILL 

660
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,850
ONLY SIGN A NEW NAFTA DEAL THAT 

661
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,452
IS GOOD FOR CANADA AS WELL AND 

662
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,086
ENDED WITH SAYING CANADA'S 

663
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:52,991
SIGNATURE IS REQUIRED. 

664
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,426
BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT 

665
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,393
SAYING, WE DON'T NEED NAFTA. 

666
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,327
WE DON'T NEED THREE COUNTRIES. 

667
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:59,097
I'M DOING THIS WITH MEXICO AND 

668
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,699
I CAN ALSO DO IT WITH CANADA 

669
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:00,932
ALONE. 

670
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,500
RIGHT NOW WE WILL JUST HAVE TO 

671
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,668
SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT BETWEEN 

672
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,169
THE U.S. AND CANADA. 

673
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,640
METAL GOODS. 

674
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,310
CANADA RESPONDED IN KIND AND 

675
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,945
THEN THERE WAS A REALLY WEIRD 

676
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,181
WAR OF WORDS WEIJA JIANG. 

677
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,884
>> Reporter: YES, WE WATCHED IT 

678
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,820
PLAY OUT ON TWITTER AND YOU 

679
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,124
MENTIONED THAT SUMMIT AND ALL 

680
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,458
OF THE PHOTO OPS, THEY WERE 

681
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,592
SHAKING HANDS, PRIME MINISTER 

682
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:05,663
TRUDEAU WELCOMED THE PRESIDENT 

683
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:06,597
TO CANADA, IT SEEMED LIKE HE 

684
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:07,932
WAS GOING TO JOIN THIS 

685
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:14,239
COMMUNIQUC BETWEEN ALL OF THE 

686
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:14,572
G7 NATIONS. 

687
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,473
EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A TRADE 

688
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,441
DISPUTE GOING ON AT THE TIME 

689
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,708
WITH TARIFFS ON CANADA AND 

690
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,945
MEXICO AND THE EU, WHEN THE 

691
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:21,779
PRESIDENT LEFT THE SUMMIT IT 

692
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,615
SEEMED AS IF THEY HAD REACHED 

693
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,182
AN AGREEMENT TO CONTINUE 

694
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,819
NEGOTIATIONS IN GOOD FAITH. 

695
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,387
BUT THEN, ON THE PLANE, THE 

696
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,654
PRESIDENT HEARD PRIME MINISTER 

697
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:37,395
TRUDEAU'S PRESS CONFERENCE IN 

698
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,162
WHICH HE STRESSED THAT CANADA 

699
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:39,097
WOULD NOT BE BULLIED WHEN IT 

700
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,432
CAME TO TRADE DEALS, INCLUDING 

701
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:47,972
TARIFFS AND NAFTA. 

702
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:48,939
YOU ARE RIGHT, IT THEN IGNITED 

703
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:50,075
A WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN THESE 

704
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:50,809
TWO LEADERS THAT PLAYED OUT ON 

705
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:51,643
SOCIAL MEDIA WITH THE PRESIDENT 

706
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,510
SAYING, FORGET IT, I AM NOT 

707
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,077
SIGNING THIS COMMUNIQUC 

708
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:54,079
ON TOP OF THAT, I AM NOT 

709
00:26:54,079 --> 00:27:03,121
BACKING DOWN ON THE TARIFFS. 

710
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,021
THAT TRIGGERED TARIFFS FROM 

711
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:04,388
CANADA AS WELL. 

712
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:05,089
THIS IS ALL HAPPENING PARALLEL 

713
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:05,990
TO THE NAFTA AGREEMENT THAT HAS 

714
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,925
BEEN IN THE WORKS THAT THEY 

715
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:07,892
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HASH OUT 

716
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:08,526
FOR ONE YEAR NOW. 

717
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,427
CANADA HAS MADE CLEAR THAT THEY 

718
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:13,064
ARE WILLING TO TALK. THEY ARE 

719
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,098
HAPPY TO DO THAT, BUT THEY WILL 

720
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:14,966
NOT SIGN ANYTHING THAT THEY 

721
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,301
BELIEVE DOES NOT BENEFIT CANADA 

722
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:16,935
AS WELL. 

723
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,269
THERE HAS TO BE SOME COMMON 

724
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,505
GROUND BETWEEN WHAT THESE TWO 

725
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,539
COUNTRIES AGREE UPON.  

726
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,512
>>> RIGHT, LET'S NOT FORGET THE 

727
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,179
PRESIDENTS TRADE ADVISOR, PETER 

728
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:28,980
NAVARRO, SAYING THERE IS A 

729
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,214
SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR 

730
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:38,022
FOREIGN LEADERS THAT ENGAGE IN 

731
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:38,489
BAD-FAITH DIPLOMACY. 

732
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,156
HE LATER APOLOGIZED FOR THAT 

733
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:39,891
PHRASING, BUT MANY PEOPLE WERE 

734
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,292
SORT OF SURPRISED BY THE 

735
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,827
NEGATIVE WORDS. WHEN AROUND 

736
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,394
THAT SAME TIME, PRESIDENT 

737
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:47,431
DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO SORT OF 

738
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:48,933
THROWING A LOT OF PRAISE ON 

739
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,034
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND SOME OTHERS 

740
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:50,835
THAT WERE TYPICALLY LEADERS 

741
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,570
THAT DID NOT RECEIVE PRAISE 

742
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,306
FROM THE UNITED STATES. BUT 

743
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,641

CONFERENCE YOU COULD HEAR 

748
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,151
REPORTERS ASKING THE PRESIDENT 

749
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,286
WHETHER OR NOT HE WANTED TO 

750
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:12,190
MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT JOHN McCAIN

751
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,491
. I DO NOT KNOW IF HE DID NOT 

752
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,925
HEAR, BUT HE CERTAINLY DID NOT 

753
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:15,827
RESPOND. 

754
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:16,628

THAT QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES AT 

756
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,666
THE END OF THE SORT OF PHOTO 

757
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,367
úO 

758
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,402
SEVERAL DIFFERENT TIMES 

759
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,403
REPORTERS ASKED, DO YOU HAVE 

760
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,671
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE LATE 

761
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,139
SENATOR? 

762
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,140
SO FAR THE ONLY THING THAT WE 

763
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,707
HAVE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT 

764
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,409
DONALD TRUMP IS VIA TWEET. 

765
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,078
HE DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING 

766
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:35,947
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SENATOR 

767
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,384
OR PERSONALLY ABOUT HIM, HE 

768
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,419
DOES EXTEND HIS CONDOLENCES TO 

769
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,722
SENATOR McCAIN'S FAMILY. OF 

770
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:47,425
COURSE THESE TWO MEN HAVE A 

771
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:51,062
LONG HISTORY ABOUT LONG TENSE 

772
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:56,501
MOMENTS BETWEEN ONE ANOTHER. 

773
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,535
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING AND 

774
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,636
EXPECTING THE PRESIDENT TO SAY 

775
00:28:58,636 --> 00:28:59,403
SOMETHING GIVEN HOW THE SENATOR 

776
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:02,706
SERVED HIS COUNTRY BOTH IN THE 

777
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:05,810
MILITARY AND IN CONGRESS. 

778
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,445
BY THE WAY, I AM LOOKING RIGHT 

779
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,849
NOW, THE FLAGS HERE HAVE BEEN A 

780
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:11,949
SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY ALL 

781
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,451
MORNING BECAUSE THEY WERE 

782
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,452
LOWERED OVER THE WEEKEND HERE 

783
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,856
AT THE WHITE HOUSE TO PAY úTRIB 

784
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,891
THIS MORNING THEY WERE RAISED 

785
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:24,162
BACK TO FULL STAFF. 

786
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,396
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE 

787
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:29,466
PRESIDENT ORDERED THEM TO BE 

788
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:32,570
RAISED, BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT 

789
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,038
HE DID NOT ORDER THEM TO REMAIN 

790
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,807
LOWERED. 

791
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:36,741
HE COULD'VE DONE THAT THROUGH A 

792
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:37,809
PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION WHICH 

793
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,344
IS TRADITIONAL IN A CASE LIKE 

794
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,146
THIS TO KEEP THE FLAGS AT HALF 

795
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:45,116
STAFF UNTIL THE SENATOR IS 

796
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,417
BURIED WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN 

797
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,254
UNTIL SUNDAY. 

798
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,388
AND SO, WE ARE NOT ONLY WAITING 

799
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,322
TO SEE IF THE PRESIDENT HAS 

800
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:58,730
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE 

801
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,330
SENATOR'S SERVICE, BUT ALSO 

802
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,231
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS 

803
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:00,865
DECISION NOT TO EXTEND THAT 

804
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,532
PROCLAMATION WHICH MANY CRITICS 

805
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:02,267
FROM BOTH SIDES ARE NOW 

806
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,801
DEMANDING THAT HE DO THAT JUST 

807
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:09,106
TO PAY ONE FINAL NOD TO SENATOR 

808
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,808
McCAIN WHO HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR 

809
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:14,712
THIS COUNTRY. 

810
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:15,813
SO FAR HE HAS NOT TAKEN THE 

811
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:16,447
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN EITHER 

812
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,615
WHEN HE JUST SPOKE.  

813
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:22,219
>> YES, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT 

814
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:23,254
HE DECIDED DELIBERATELY NOT TO 

815
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,389
ISSUE AN OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE 

816
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,491
STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF 

817
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,692
JOHN McCAIN, INSTEAD CHOOSING 

818
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,594
THIS TWEET WHICH YOU RIGHTLY 

819
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,064
POINTED OUT EXTENDS SYMPATHIES 

820
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:33,864
TO HIS FAMILY, BUT NOTHING 

821
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:42,106
ABOUT THE GREAT SERVICE 

822
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:42,706
PROVIDED BY JOHN McCAIN 

823
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:43,508
THROUGHOUT HIS DECADES AND 

824
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,008
DECADES OF SERVICE IN 

825
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,209
WASHINGTON AND ALSO MILITARY 

826
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,778
SERVICE. 

827
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,046
WE WILL SEE, HE STILL HAS TIME 

828
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,113
TO MAKE A COMMENT. 

829
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:54,886
>> Reporter: HE HAS TIME, BUT 

830
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:55,787
ANNE-MARIE, I WANT TO POINT 

831
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,621
OUT, LET'S SAY THAT HE HAD 

832
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,425
ISSUED A STATEMENT, PART OF THE 

833
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,826
CONVERSATION WOULD BE, HOW 

834
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:02,460
SINCERE IS THIS STATEMENT? 

835
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,360
THEY REALLY DO HAVE A LONG 

836
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,162
HISTORY OF PRETTY HARSH WORDS 

837
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,095
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. 

838
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:06,197
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, THE 

839
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,267
PRESIDENT NOT BY NAME MENTIONED 

840
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:11,035
SENATOR McCAIN WHEN HE WAS 

841
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,203
TALKING ABOUT REPEALING OBAMA 

842
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,604
CARE WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN 

843
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,840
BECAUSE OF McCAIN'S VOTE THAT 

844
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,374
WAS TONS DOWN ON THE SENATE 

845
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:20,545
FLOOR -- THUMBS DOWN ON THE 

846
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:20,912
SENATE FLOOR. 

847
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,047
SO THE PRESIDENT'S YOU KNOW 

848
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,151
DEFINITELY -- THE PRESIDENT, 

849
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,519
YOU KNOW, DEFTLY HAS SPOKEN A 

850
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,123
LOT ABOUT HOW HE BELIEVES THE 

851
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,358
SENATOR DISAPPOINTED THE PARTY 

852
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:41,332
AND AMERICANS. 

853
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,333
McCAIN DID NOT CARE, HE STOOD 

854
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,234
BY HIS BELIEFS AND HAD HARSH 

855
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,002
WORDS FOR THE PRESIDENT AS 

856
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:44,202
WELL. 

857
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,236
THERE IS NO LOVE LOST, SO IF 

858
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,037
THE PRESIDENT HAD ISSUED A 

859
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:46,771
STATEMENT WITH VERY KIND WORDS 

860
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,405
FOR McCAIN, PERHAPS THE 

861
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,940
CRITICISM THEN WOULD BE DOES HE 

862
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:56,981
MEAN IT? 

863
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,949
IT IS HARD TO TELL, WHAT WE DO 

864
00:31:58,949 --> 00:31:59,150
 

865
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,117
STATEMENT, AT LEAST SO FAR FROM 

866
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:00,517
THE PRESIDENT.  

867
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:01,519
>>> GOOD POINTS, WEIJA JIANG,

WE HAVE A LOT MORE NEWS AHEAD, 

872
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,595
THIS IS CBSN. 

873
