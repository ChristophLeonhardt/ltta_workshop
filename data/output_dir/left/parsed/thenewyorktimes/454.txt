I had just gotten out of high school
when Pearl Harbor was bombed
and changed our lives.
By 1942, the order would come
and we would have to move out.
We would get sandstorms,
frequently.
And the sand would seep into the
living quarters and everything
else you forget when
these storms started.
We became “no-noes” so-called.
We were protesting because we
weren't being treated as citizens.
There were guards, armed guards.
If people got too close to the
fence and looked suspicious,
you’d be shot.
Tule Lake has really affected my,
my life. Because for a long time
I thought that I was
responsible for it.
But the truth is that
I was just the victim.
We have to remember what's
guaranteed in the Constitution,
because it seems that it’s
easy to disregard it, somehow.
