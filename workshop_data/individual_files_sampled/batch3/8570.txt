THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STAND THE SELF-DRIVING CARS. BRIAN: IT PUTS DRIVERS OUT OF BUSINESS. LET'S GO TO NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND AUTHOR OF A BRAND NEW BOOK, IT'S COMING OUT SOON, JUNE 5TH, ACTUALLY. CALLED TRUMP'S AMERICA. NEWT, WOULD YOU EVER GET IN A DRIVERLESS CAR? SURE, IN FACT, I WENT OUT TWO YEARS AGO WITH MY TEAM AND WE RODE AROUND ON GOOGLE'S DRIVERLESS CAR AND IT WAS FASCINATING. BRIAN: DID YOU SURVIVE? WELL, LOOK, IS A TIS PARTICULARLY THEY ARE SAFER THAN DRIVERS. IF YOU ARE OUT LATE AT NIGHT AND YOUR CHOICE COMING OUT OF THE BAR IS YOUR COUSIN WHO HAS HAD FIVE DRINKS TOO MUCH. AINSLEY: GOOD POINT. OR DRIVERLESS CAR. TAKE THE DRIVERLESS CAR. IT'S SAFER. BRIAN: WHAT ABOUT A SKATEBOARD? BRIAN: THOSE ARE YOUR ONLY TWO CHOICES. AINSLEY: MR. SPEAKER LET'S TALK ABOUT LAST NIGHT THE RALLY IN NASHVILLE PRESIDENT SAYING OUR COUNTRY IS NOW RESPECTED AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE HIGH STAKES NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. HOW DO YOU FEEL? WELL, I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE REALLY GAINING MOMENTUM AND THE REPORT BY THE RESERVE THAT WE MIGHT BE AT 4.1% ECONOMIC GROWTH THIS QUARTER. THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS IN EUROPE AND IN JAPAN, AND ELSEWHERE. HAVING AMERICA BACK WITH JOB CREATION, HAVING US BACK WITH EXPLORATION IN SPACE. HAVING US REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, ALL THOSE THINGS GIVE US MUSCLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA. AND I THINK THE FIRM TOUGHNESS, ACTUALLY I THOUGHT SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO'S SPEECH ABOUT IRAN KOREA. IT IS A VERY TOUGH SPEECH. AND SAYS TO THE IRANIANS HERE ARE THE BAD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU DON'T FALL IN LINE. WELL, IN A SENSE, IF YOU ARE KIM JONG UN AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT THAT SPEECH, YOU ARE THINKING OH YEAH, THAT COULD APPLY TO ME, TOO. I THINK THE PRESIDENT SO FAR HAS BASICALLY DONE PRETTY GOOD JOB. THE NORTH KOREANS FOR YEARS GOT A DEAL, TOOK THE MONEY AND BROKE THEIR WORD. WE WILL KEEP ALL THE SANCTIONS ON UNTIL WE CAN VERIFY THAT YOU ARE DOING THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE. FRANKLY THE SOUTH KOREANS ARE BEGGING THE NORTH KOREANS TO CUT A DEAL. SOUTH KOREAS ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE DANGERS OF A REAL WAR DANGEROUS FOR SOUTH KOREA. THEY ARE DRAWING KIM JONG UN. YOU WILL NOTICE HE WENT FOR A SURPRISE SUMMIT MEETING OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA. SENT BACK THE WORD OH, YEAH. I REALLY DO WANT TO MEET, SORRY YOU FELT BAD ABOUT IT. AND, THEY HAVE TEAMS NOW WORKING IN SINGAPORE, THEY APPARENTLY HAVE A TEAM MEETING MEETING IN NEW YORK. NOT GOING TO BE A MAGIC MOMENT KIM JONG UN DECIDES TO GIVE UP ALL OF HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN RETURN FOR A VISIT TO MAR-A-LAGO OR A PROMISE BY TRUMP TO OPEN UP THREE GOLF COURSES. I MEAN THESE GUYS ARE TOUGH. THEY SPENT THREE GENERATIONS GOING THROUGH TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES TRYING TO BUILD THESE WEAPONS. AND IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY TOUGH GETTING THEM TO GIVE THEM UP. BRIAN: SO IT'S JUNE 12TH HAPPENS, IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE THE START. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WALK OUT WITH A DEAL. I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE MIND SET SHOULD BE THE MIND SET GOING IN, CORRECT? THE MIE MIND SET. TOUGHEN THEM UNLESS THEY ARE BEING REASONABLE. REAGAN USED TO SAY OLD VERIFY. THESE GUYS HAVE SUCH A TERRIBLE RECORD. THE PHRASE IS MISTRUST AND VERIFY, VERIFY, VERIFY. BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THEIR TRACK RECORD IS SUCH THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET OUT OF DOING ANYTHING REAL. PETE: HAS BEEN UNDER SIEGE AT HOME. AS YOU OFTEN DO YOU DISSECTED WHAT HE IS FACING IN THE MUELLER PROBE. YOU SAY IT'S NOT ONE SCANDAL. IT'S ACTUALLY FIVE SCANDALS. DISSECT THAT FOR US. WILL YOU? YEAH. I ACTUALLY WROTE A PIECE A NEWSLETTER BOTH FOR GINGRICH PRODUCTIONS AND POSTED @FOXNEWS.COM. THE CHALLENGE HAVE YOU GOT IS YOU ORIGINALLY HAVE THE CLINTON SCANDALS GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO CATTLE FUTURE IN 1978 WHEN SHE MADE $98,000 ON A $1,000 INVESTMENT WHICH IS CLEARLY JUST CALLED FRAUD. BUT THE CLINTONS HAVE HAD SCANDALS THEIR WHOLE CAREER. THEN YOU HAVE THE SCANDAL OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEEP STATE COVERING UP FOR THE CLINTONS, OFFERING IMMUNITY. YOU KNOW, IMAGINE, THIS GUY BLEACH BITS THE COMPUTER SO THEY GIVE HIM IMMUNITY? THEY DON'T CHARGE EITHER OF HER TOP STAFF PEOPLE? I MEAN, LOOK AT HOW THEY TREAT THE TRUMP PEOPLE. LOOK AT HOW THEY TREATED THE HILLARY CLINTON PEOPLE. THEN, THIRD, YOU HAVE THE SCANDAL OF A TOTALLY FALSE, WE'RE NOW LEARNING VERY LONG OBAMA ADMINISTRATION EFFORT TO DESTROY TRUMP THROUGH A VARIETY OF INVESTIGATIONS. AND I'M CONVINCED IT GOES UP TO VALERIE JARRETT AND TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. YOU COULDN'T HAVE HAD THIS SCALE OF ACTIVITY ON THAT FRONT. THEN, FOURTH, YOU HAVE THE SCANDAL OF THE FBI ITSELF BREAKING DOWN. WE NOW HAVE HAD THE TOP GUY RESIGN. WE HAVE HAD THE NUMBER TWO GUY RESIGN. BOTH OF THEM MAY WELL FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES. YOU HAD SEVERAL OTHER TOP PEOPLE HAD TO RESIGN OR RETIRE. ALL OF THAT TIES BACK INTO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE. AND THEN FINALLY, YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME PEOPLE LIKE GENERAL CLAPPER KIND OF MELT DOWN BECAUSE I THINK THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO THOUGHT THEY COULD GO AHEAD AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO BECAUSE HILLARY WOULD COVER IT UP. IT'S GRADUALLY SINKING IT THEY MIGHT BE VULNERABLE AND I LOOK AT THE CIA DIRECTOR AND THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, YOU KNOW, TWO OF THE GOOD EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO REALLY WENT OVER THE LINE ASSUMING THEY WOULD BE PROTECTED AND NOW THEY COULD BE FACED WITH SERIOUS CHARGES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. BRIAN: BOTH GUYS WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE TO VERIFY INTELLIGENCE AND COME OUT WITH VERY LEARNED OPINIONS HAVE SAID WELL, I THINK THAT PUTIN HAS BEEN HAS COMPROMISED TRUMP AND CLAPPER THINKS RUSSIA THREW THE ELECTION. I'M JUST SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T POINT TO THAT TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE. THEY ARE ACTING LIKE GUILTY PEOPLE. NEWT, THANKS SO MUCH. I CANNOT WAIT FOR YOUR BOOK. WELL, LOOK, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE BREAKING POINT FOR ME WAS THE INTERVIEW CLAPPER DID WHERE HE SAID HE HATED TO USE THE WORD SPY. AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, THIS GUY WAS THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. AINSLEY: I KNOW, RIGHT. HE WAS THEORETICALLY IN CHARGE OF ALL OF OUR SPIES THAT WOULD BE LIKE HAVING A GUY WHO IS A BAR KEEPER WHO DOESN'T LIKE ALCOHOL AND REFUSES TO SERVE IT I MEAN, JUST CHALLENGING HOW SCREWED UP THESE GUYS ARE GETTING AS THEY FACE A WORLD THEY NEVER
