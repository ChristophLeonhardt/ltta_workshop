Shannon: FBI AGENTS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES FEELING THE HEAT FROM THE WATCHDOG REPORT. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, FORMER OFFICIAL FOR SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT THE CLINTON EMAIL PROBE WITH HER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN JOHN PODESTA. THE IG SAYS FORMER ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL PETER KESWICK DEMONSTRATED POOR JUDGMENT IN FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. KESWICK TRIED TO GET HIS SON A JOB WITH DAILY CONTENT CAMPAIGN, EMAILING A CLINTON STAFFER LET ME KNOW IF YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE NEEDS A GREAT ASSISTANT. BY 25-YEAR-OLD SON IS READY FOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. LET'S BRING IN PETER SCHWEIZER, WELCOME. LET'S START WITH PETER KADLEC. HE CLEARLY HAD SOME CONNECTION, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT INITIAL ASSESSMENT BY THE IG THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF CONNECTION BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO TAINT THIS. I THINK IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHY WAS HE INTERACTING THE WAY HE WAS AND WHY WAS HE SHARING INFORMATION WITH JOHN PODESTA? THE IG REPORT POINTS OUT THAT HE ACTUALLY TIPPED OFF JOHN PODESTA WHO WAS HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN ABOUT THE RELEASE SCHEDULE OF THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAILS IN 2016. AT THE SAME TIME THAT IS YOUR POINT OF OUTCOME HE IS TRYING TO GET A JOB FOR HIS 25-YEAR-OLD SON. IT JUST LOOKS BAD. THIS IS THE KIND OF SMALL FISH BEHAVIOR PEOPLE DON'T LIKE. YOU SAY DIDN'T REALLY BREAK ANY LAWS. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE EXPECT IMPARTIALITY AND WE DON'T EXPECT THEM TO BE SHARING INFORMATION THEY SHOULDN'T BE SHARING WHILE THE SAME TIME GETTING FAVORS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT'S CLEARLY WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO. Shannon: SOMEONE ELSE MENTIONED QUITE A FEW TIMES IN THIS REPORT THAT A LOT OF FOLKS MAY NOT HAVE EXPECTED TO FIGURE SO PROMINENTLY IS FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR TERRY McAULIFFE. OBVIOUSLY VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THE CLINTONS, KEY POLITICAL PLAYER WITH THEM. AND THE PARTY MORE BROADLY. THERE IS TALK AND HEAR OF HIS CONNECTION, HIS TAX CONNECTION INTONATIONS TO ANDREW MCCABE'S WIFE. WE'VE BEEN OVER THE TERRITORY BEFORE. BUT THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF ADMONISHMENT HERE THAT THERE WERE SIZABLE DONATIONS THAT THE RECUSAL TO HAPPEN BUT MAYBE IT WASN'T FULLY RESPECTED BY McCABE ONCE THIS WAS IN FULL PLAY. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. ENTER McCABE WAS TOLD TO RECUSE HIMSELF AND NOT BE INVOLVED IN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION INVESTIGATION, AND HE WAS ANYWAY. LOOK, THIS IS THE WAY THE CLINTONS OF OPERATED FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS IN POLITICS. AND THAT IS THAT THEY HAVE A NETWORK OF RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDS. IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT AS FAR AS A LEGAL STANDARD IS CONCERNED OF PROVING A QUID PROQ CONCERNED OF PROVING A QUID PROO CONCERNED OF PROVING A QUID PROR SOME KIND OF COLLUSION BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IT'S A THIRD PARTY INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, HILLARY CLINTON IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI. HILLARY CLINTON HAS NO CONNECTION WITH ANDREW McKAY BUT ONE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CLOSE POLITICAL ALLIES, THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDING GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINH GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINN GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINR GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDIND GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINS GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINO GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDIN GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINH GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINU GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINA GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDIND GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINS OF DOLLARS TO THE CAMPAIGN OF ANGER McCABE'S WIFE. IT'S TANGLED, INDIRECT, HARD TO PROVE BUT IT STILL LEAVES THE SAME KIND OF STENCH AND THAT'S REALLY THE PROBLEM. PEOPLE WILL SAY, SHANNON, WHY IS THERE THIS OBSESSION WITH HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON ON ALL THE STUFF? SHE'S NOT IN OFFICE ANYMORE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE CLINTONS. IT'S ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW. IT'S ABOUT IMPARTIAL JUSTICE. AND I THINK AS THIS IG REPORT SHOWS, THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT WE GOTTEN THESE CLINTON INVESTIGATIONS. Shannon: A LOT OF FOLKS, CONSERVATIVES LOOKING AT THE REPORTS AND HILLARY CLINTON GOT ALL KINDS OF PASSES THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE. EXCLUDED THERE WERE FINDINGS THAT THE FBI AGENTS WERE SUPPORTIVE OF HILLARY CLINTON AND ANTI-DONALD TRUMP, THEN A CANDIDATE. HERE IS WHAT THE SENATE'S TOP DEMOCRAT CHUCK SCHUMER HAD TO SAY TODAY. DIRECTOR COMEY'S MISHANDLING OF THE PUBLICITY AROUND THE CLINTON EMAIL CAMPAIGN WILL PROVE TO THE BENEFIT OF THEN CANDIDATE TRUMP COMING NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. IT WAS TRUMP WHO BENEFITED FROM ALL THESE MISTAKES. SO IT HARDLY REFLECTS DEEP STATE OR BIAS AGAINST. Shannon: THAT SORT OF SUMS UP ALL THE PRESS RELEASES I GOT FROM EVERY DEMOCRAT ON THE HILL TODAY. IT DIDN'T HELP HILLARY. IT HURT HER. AND HELP DONALD TRUMP. THERE WAS NO BIAS. THE G.O.P. IS TRYING TO LINK THIS TO SOMEHOW DISCREDIT THE MEAL INVESTIGATION. THERE'S NO PROOF OF THE DEEP STATE. AND THAT JAMES COMEY WENT PUBLIC WITH A HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION BUT STAYED SILENT ON THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. ON AND ON AND ON. THEY SAY THAT IT ACTUALLY WAS VERY BAD FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN THE END. DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATION AND EVERY SINGLE TURN WHETHER IT WAS THE INTERVIEW WITH HER, THE INTERVIEW WITH HER COLLEAGUES, AND THE SPECIAL CONCESSIONS THEY WERE GRANTED. THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T SUBPOENA THE DEVICES. THEY SIMPLY ASKED FOR THEM. I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON. EACH ONE OF THOSE CASES THE BENEFIT WAS TO HILLARY CLINTON. IN ONE CASE IN WHICH THEY ARGUE THAT IT HURT HILLARY CLINTON, IT WAS THE COMEY ANNOUNCEMENTS OF LEADER THAT THEY WERE REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION. HE HAD TO DO THAT BECAUSE HE HAD TOLD A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE EARLIER THAT THEY THERE WERE NO EMAILS OUT THERE AND THERE WAS NO LONGER THE CASE. HE WAS FORCED TO DO THAT NOT OUT OF POLITICAL CALCULATION BUT BECAUSE HE FACED THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF BEING ACCUSED OF LYING TO CONGRESS. SO IT'S LAUGHABLE TO ME THAT THEY TAKE ONE INCIDENT IN A LONG CHAIN OF EVENTS AND SAY THIS ONE INCIDENT PROVES THAT THERE WAS NO BIAS. YOU SIMPLY CAN'T LOOK AT THIS IN ANY SYSTEMATIC WAY AND COME TO ANY OTHER CONCLUSION THAT HILLARY CLINTON GOT FAVORABLE
