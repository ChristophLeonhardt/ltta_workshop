so Rex Tillerson fired by Donald Trump he pointedly refused to resign and then was fired which again is not unprecedented but incredibly rare especially for a position as high as Secretary of State so then he's gonna give a press conference which is also weird and rare that as a person has been fired he now has to go give a press conference about all the people he's thanking so first he makes it clear that in fact he will be leaving let's watch I received a call today from the Friends of the United States at a little after noontime from Air Force One and I've also spoken the White House chief of staff Kelly to ensure we have clarity as to the days ahead what is most important is to ensure an orderly of smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges as such effective at the end of the day I'm delegating all responsibilities of the office of the secretary to Deputy Secretary of State Sullivan my commission as Secretary of State will terminate at midnight March the 31st so let me interpret a couple of things in there his term is supposed to end March 31st were not at March 31st he's Lee he says I'm leaving midnight tonight in other words I'm out I'm God man I don't want any piece of this then the reason he said he got a call from the president is because reports are from inside the State Department that the first time he officially knew that he was fired was in a tweet so that again is very non-standard to say the least but there he's clarifying no I got a call from the president and he fired me so and then that happened okay so then he goes on to thank people for six long minutes and one person he did not mention in those six minutes was president Donald Trump so then of course Washington goes into overdrive on this knob heard around the world oh my god he snubbed him he snubbed him of course he just got fired by the guy what is he supposed to say like now it was an honor to be fired by President Trump now remember he was earlier what about how Tillison thought Trump is a moron in fact an effing moron and he never liked when he was first brought in everything was hunky-dory said wow I'm gonna be Secretary of State this is amazing it's an honor wonderful all that stuff he spent some time with Donald Trump he's like okay this guy's a moron I don't know I gotta get a D right and and and at that point he realizes what a clown that Donald Trump is eventually that clown fires him why in the world would he thank that guy of course he's not gonna thank him it would be preposterous to thank him so at least he's not a standard politician in that way and he didn't humiliate himself in that way on his way out so I respect that so now more importantly at the end he's gonna take one more shot at Russia here now remember Tillison used to be great friends with Putin the leader of Rosneft which is the largest Russian oil company he had gotten a medal from Putin and they were on great terms and in fact I believe he was brought in because of the deal between ExxonMobil and Russia so but since then things have gone sour and Tillerson has not been able to lift the old sanctions and just last week exxon mobil announced that no we are not going to do with the deal with russia anymore so Russia is now irate at Rex Tillerson and so he comes out on Monday right before he's fired and says the Russians are the ones who did the poisoning of the X agent of theirs in the UK now that was not sanctioned by the Trump administration apparently they were furious about that cuz Trump basically works for Putin and you all of you thinking that's hyperbole I'll see you guys in the indictments and I expect apologies at that time so and you're still not seeing it okay anyway so now Tillerson because he knows what's going on behind the scenes pase one more shot at rush on his way out and much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior actions on the part of the Russian government Russia must assess carefully as to how its actions are in the best interest of the Russian people and of the world more broadly continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead you're greater isolation on their part a situation which is not in anyone's interest so it's like look man this isn't gonna work out for any of you guys now one last thing that's unspoken here and and and no one else is pointing at till it's just a crafty guy you don't get to be the CEO of ExxonMobil by not being bright now you could say other things about how I got to be the CEO of Exxon Mobil you might say lacking a certain degree of morals as the fossil fuel companies light up the world with climate change etc so don't get me wrong I'm not praising Rex Tillerson in that sense but he's no dummy you don't get to rise up politically with an Exxon Mobil if you're not bright so part of what he's doing is taking a party shot at Trump and Russia but the other thing that he's doing is basically saying man when this stuff goes down ain't got nothing do with it man remember at the end I was against Russia remember all the things I said against Russia when you hand out the indictments I don't want any piece of that he's a crafty guy and that's what he was saying there that that I think is clear at least to me apparently not as clear to the rest of the media what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream
