>> MAKING QUITE CLEAR HOW THEY
FEEL ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
NOMINEE ABOUT THE HIGHEST COURT.
FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND
COLLUSION BE ALLOWED TO PICK A
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHO WILL
BE THERE?
I WILL BE DEAD.
THERE WILL BE MANY PEOPLE IN
THIS ROOM WHO WILL STILL BE
ALIVE AND ABORTIONS, WHAT HAVE
YOU, NEED HEALTH CARE.
HOW DARE HE BE ALLOWED TO DO
STEVE: OUR NEXT GUEST SHOWS HOW
DISCONNECTED THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAS BECOME.
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, RADIO TALK
SHOW HOST TAMMY BRUCE IS HERE TO
EXPLAIN.
APPARENTLY SHE HAS NEVER PROVEN
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.
>> THAT IS GREAT DEAL IS FAULT.
MADE CLEAR THE PRESIDENT IS NOT
QUOTE, UNDER INVESTIGATION.
SEEING, MOST EXPENSIVE GROUP
THERAPY WE'VE EVER SEEN IN THIS
COUNTRY.
THE FACT ALL OF THIS WON'T STOP
THIS NOMINATION.
WHEN YOU HAVE THE PROCESS THAT
YOU HAVE AS REPRESENTATIVE
GOVERNMENT.
PRESIDENT WON.
EVERYBODY GENERALLY AGREES THAT
JUSTICE, JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A
SMART MAN, HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS
DOING.
THIS SEEMS TO BE EFFORT TO GIN
UP SPORT FOR THE MIDTERMS.
IF THERE WAS ACTUAL POLICY
SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE YOU
WOULD NOT NEED TO GIN UP SUPPORT
COMES TO WHAT WE NEED IN THIS
COUNTRY, GENUINE, THOUGHTFUL,
BALANCED, FAIR APPROACH TO
JUSTICE THAT IS WHAT KAVANAUGH
THIS MELTDOWN WE'VE SEEN ACROSS
THE BOARD.
IN GENERAL THEY REALLY DON'T
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO BECAUSE THE
PRESIDENT IS DOING SO WELL.
AINSLEY: WHAT DID YOU THINK
ABOUT THE WOMEN'S MARCH WRITING
FILLED IN KAVANAUGH'S NAME, BUT
IN THE SUBJECT, IT SAID IN
RESPONSE TO DONALD TRUMP'S
NOMINATION OF XX, FORGOT TO FILL
IN HIS NAME TO THE SUPREME COURT
THE WOMEN'S MARCH RELEASED
FOLLOWING STATEMENT.
TRUMP'S ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY IS
DEATH SENTENCE FOR THOUSANDS OF
>> OTHER ES DID THAT.
ONE GROUP PUT OUT A RELEASE
OPPOSES ROE V. WADE.
THERE WAS A FIND AND REPLACE
TELLS YOU THEY'RE NOT REALLY
THINKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS.
HERE IS WHAT THEY'RE MISSING.
THEY'RE NOT EVEN MAKING AN
EFFORT TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES
WITH HIM, TO MOVE IN THERE, THEY
DEMOCRAT SENATORS.
WE HAVE NO INTERESTS, KAMALA
HARRIS.
HE IS PERSUADABLE.
THAT IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST
CONCERNS ABOUT HIM, HE CAN BE
MOVED.
DEMOCRATS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO DO
THAT I CONTEND BECAUSE THEY WANT
THIS INSTEAD.
THEY WANT THE DIVISION.
AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST, MAYBE
FEEL AS THOUGH WE ARE.
BRIAN: I GET THE SENSE THE
NUMBER OF INDEPENDENTS IN THIS
GETTING DISTATEFUL ON BOTH
PARTIES AND CATACLYSMIC THEORIES
AND STATEMENTS.
BOTH KNOW THEY'RE FOOLHARDY.
I SENSE TOO, TAMMY, THIS IS THE
SENATORS IN RED STATES.
>> HE HAS NO REAL LEVERAGE
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALREADY
OBSTRUCTING.
THEN WHAT DO THEY EXPECT IF THEY
ARE YOU GOING TO GET AMY BARRETT
WHO WOULD BE EXCELLENT JURIST?
WHAT DO THEY EXPECT?
THEY NEED TO ENGAGE, THIS IS
PART OF A PROCESS WORKING
TOGETHER.
FOR THE MIDTERMS.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S THIRD TERM AND CYBER
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 50 YEARS.
THEIR OBSTRUCTION.
IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
IF THEY WORK TOGETHER WITH HIM.
