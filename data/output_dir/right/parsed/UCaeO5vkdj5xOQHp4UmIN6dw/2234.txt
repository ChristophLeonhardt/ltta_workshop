then I didn't really know each other
very well we were always you know always
greet each other pleasantly but I do
remember this that I didn't pay much
attention to him you know cuz he was
kind of a kid you know I wasn't really
paying attention and one day I was
recording an audio book I was recording
one of my books and it was one of the
rare times when I wasn't working in the
morning so I was in my car driving to
record my audio book and I turned on the
radio and I'm listening to this guy and
I thought wow this guy's a really
talented broadcaster and it was bent and
and I wrote to him and I said gee I
never knew you had any talent but that
was the first moment I actually noticed
him that I noticed that he was actually
quite good on the air
