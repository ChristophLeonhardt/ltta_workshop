OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES,

00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,349
TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT JOHN

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:16,950
MCCAIN MEANT FOR ARIZONA.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,116
THIS

5
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:19,185
IS A REGION THAT HAS EXPLODED

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:19,685
OVER THE YEARS.

7
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:22,422
>> WHEN YOU ARE INVOLVED IN

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,090
TRYING TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN,

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,426
THE EXPANSION OF THE PLAZA

10
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:28,828
DOWNTOWN, THE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM,

11
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:40,507
THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. I

12
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,143
NEEDED TO LEAN ON OUR LEADERSHIP

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:43,910
WHO REPRESENTED ARIZONA WHO

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,478
REPRESENT US WELL IN WASHINGTON

15
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,045
DC.

16
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,514
SO WE WERE GETTING OUR FAIR

17
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,615
SHARE OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED FOR

18
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,650
US TO MOVE FORWARD TO, EXPAND,

19
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:50,883
TO GROW.

20
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:52,718
TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS.

21
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:58,191
MANY, MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH

22
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,592
JOHN ABOUT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF

23
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:00,226
THOSE ISSUES.

24
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:00,993
AND HE WAS ALWAYS

25
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:02,061
THERE TO BE SUPPORTIVE.

26
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,797
>> AND WE KNOW OF SENATOR

27
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,964
MCCAIN AS A FIGHTER, WHAT CAN

28
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:07,767
YOU TELL US AS A CLOSE FRIEND TO

29
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,904
SHED SOME LIGHT ON HIS BEHAVIOR

30
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,538
AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS?

31
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,372
DID HE SAY

32
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,173
ANYTHING TO YOU OR EXPRESS

33
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:15,141
ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT THIS

34
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,311
LATEST FIGHT IN HIS LIFE?

35
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,314
>> I WOULD SAY THIS.

36
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:21,580
WATCHING

37
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,185
HIM FROM A DISTANCE AS IT

38
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,420
RELATES TO POSTANNOUNCEMENT

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,391
REGARDING HIS ILLNESS, HE DID

40
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,058
THIS WITH SUCH CLASS, HE DID IT

41
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:36,229
WITH SUCH DIGNITY.

42
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,564
IT'S AMAZING.

43
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,833
I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE,

44
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,735
MYSELF INCLUDED, WOULD RESPOND.

45
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,773
BUT HE SET A GREAT EXAMPLE ABOUT

46
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,975
HOW TO FADE AWAY IN SUCH A

47
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,443
CLASSY WAY.

48
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,246
>> JERRY, HANG ON THE PHONE FOR

49
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:53,646
US.

50
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,947
BUT WE DO HAVE REACTION THAT

51
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,051
IS NOW POURING IN FROM SO MANY

52
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,284

WORD IN FROM THE MCCAIN CAMPAIGN

BETTER THAN AVERAGE.

WITH HIM ON HIS CAMPAIGN.

385
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,225
THEN

386
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,427
HE CAMPAIGNED ON MINE.

387
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:35,760
AND WE'D

388
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,731
GO OUT TO SNOWFLAKE, AND HE'D

389
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,632
JOKE ENDLESSLY THAT IF I DIDN'T

390
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:42,368
HAVE 69 FIRST COUSINS ON MY

391
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,402
FATHER'S SIDE, I WOULD NEVER

392
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,736

00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,722
I JUST WROTE AN OPED, I

402
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,193
THINK THE WASHINGTON POST WILL

403
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:12,864
BE RUNNING IT. I WAS JUST IN THE

404
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:14,667

SPENDING.

412
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,581
AND I REMEMBERED ON A

413

FLIGHT, JOHN CAME BACK TO ME AND

414
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,550
STUCK HIS FINGER IN MY CHEST,

415
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,118

00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,520
LET ME HAVE IT!

00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,844
BEHAVIOR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER

435
00:12:58,844 --> 00:12:59,411
THE PAST YEAR.

PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM.

446
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,493
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT HAS HAD AN

447
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,329
IMPACT ON THE SENATOR OVER THE

448

THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.

AND JOHN

00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:40,152
FAMILIAR WITH HIS CAMPAIGN WHEN

463
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,887

AND

00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:51,363
THAT'S JUST A LITTLE REMOVED

468
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,533
FROM THE POLITICS WE SEE TODAY,

469
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,634

00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,409
THINK HE'S SO APPRECIATED AND

474
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,109
LOVED.

00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:09,181
ABOUT THE SENATOR'S INTELLECTUAL

477
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,082
CURIOSITY.

478
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,117

SENATORS, LAWMAKERS GO OFF TO

480
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,521

481
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,790
BEEN THERE AS LONG AS JOHN HAD

482
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,091
BEEN, THEY START MAILING IT IN.

483
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,592

495
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,075

00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,088
WAS INTELLECTUALLY CURIOUS TO

AND HE SHOWED ME WHAT IT IS TO

573
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,894
BE A MAN.

574
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,463
SHE ENDED THIS NOTE

575
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,064
WITH A QUOTE "THE DREAM IS

576
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:39,297
ENDING.

577
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,432
THIS IS THE MORNING".

578
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:45,804
AND THAT IS A QUOTE FROM CS.

579
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,305
LEWIS.

580
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,873
HIS WORK CALLED THE LAST

581
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,173
BATTLE.

582
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,374
>> IT IS A POWERFUL, POWERFUL

583
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,109
MESSAGE.

584
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,510
THE BOND THAT WE HAVE

585
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,314
SEEN BETWEEN FATHER AND

586
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:57,916
DAUGHTER.

587
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,918
AND I HAVE MET MEGAN

588
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,954
MCCAIN ON MULTIPLE TIMES, RAN

589
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,488
INTO HER ON STREETS IN NEW YORK

590
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,424
CITY TWO YEARS AGO.

591
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,592
SHE IS A

592
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,260
SPITFIRE HERSELF.

593
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,127
SHE IS JUST

594
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:09,560
LIKE HER FATHER.

595
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,396
I SWEAR SHE

596
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,263
CHANNELS SOME OF HER FATHER'S

597
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:13,198
FIGHT IN HER.

598
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,633
>> VERY TRUE.

599
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,468
>> YOU'LL SEE THE JOHN MCCAIN

600
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,670
IN HIS DAUGHTER.

601
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,039
>> FAMILY WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO

602
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,240
HIM.

603
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,839
AND HE OBVIOUSLY SHOWED

604
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,242
THAT CARING FOR HIS FAMILY

605
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,077
THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER.

606
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,513
AND JUST ALWAYS EXPRESSING --

607
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:29,815
YOU ALWAYS SAW HER AROUND,

608
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,983
ESPECIALLY DURING THE 2008

609
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:31,750
CAMPAIGN.

610
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,521
ALWAYS BY HIS SIDE IN

611
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:45,363
THOSE BIG MOMENTS.

612
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:46,999
>> A LOT OF REACTION POURING IN

613
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,501
FROM THE PRESIDENT.

614
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,369
THE PHOENIX

615
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:50,936
MAYOR.

616
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:51,303
CINDY MCCAIN.

617
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:55,007
>> WE LITERALLY HAVE A BUNCH OF

618
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,109
TABS OPEN HERE WITH SO MANY

619
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,578
PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSE TO JOHN

620
00:17:59,578 --> 00:17:59,845
MCCAIN.

621
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,846
ALL OF THEM HAVE STUFF

622
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,213
TO SAY.

623
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,181
AND WE WANT TO START

624
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,448
WITH CINDY MCCAIN.

625
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:04,283
THE SENATOR'S

626
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:04,483
WIFE.

627
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,118
SHE HAS A NEW TWEET THAT

628
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,120
SAYS "MY HEART IS BROKEN.

629
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,387
I'M SO

LUCKY TO HAVE LIVED THE

631
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:10,589
ADVENTURE OF LOVING THIS

632
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,024
INCREDIBLE MAN FOR 38 YEARS.

633
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:12,157
HE

634
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,259
PASSED THE WAY HE LIVED, ON HIS

00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,527
OWN TERMS, SURROUNDED BY THE

00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,097
PEOPLE HE LOVED IN THE PLACE HE

THESE TWEETS

648
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,951

THIS NEWS, WE'RE SEEING THE

652
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,555
TWEETS APPEAR FROM OTHER FIGURES

653
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,824
WHO HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO JOHN

654
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:46,925
MCCAIN IN VARIOUS ASPECTS.

655
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,526
ONE

656
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,027
FROM LINDSEY GRAHAM, A SENATOR

657
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,795
HIMSELF, AND HIS FIRST REACTION

658
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:55,433
ON TWITTER WAS "AMERICA LOST ONE

659
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,902
OF ITS GREATEST CHAMPIONS, AND

660
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,804
I'VE LOST ONE OF MY DEAREF

661
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,304
FRIENDS AND MENTORS."

662
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,441
>> THE TWO OF THEM WERE ALLIES.

663
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:02,975
>> YEAH.

664
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,176
AND WHAT KIND OF

665
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,212
THINGS DID THEY HAVE

666
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,981
SHOWCASES THE BOND THEY HAD?

667
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,549
>> WHEN YOU FIRST THINK ABOUT

668
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,052
LINDSEY GRAHAM, THEY SAT SIDE BY

669
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:14,252
SIDE.

670
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:16,255
WHEN GRAHAM RAN FOR

671
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,056
PRESIDENT, YES, A LOT OF PEOPLE

672
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,891
FORGET THAT, BUT JOHN MCCAIN WAS

673
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:25,831
HIS LOYAL FRIEND AND ENDORSED

674
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,098
HIM.

675
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:26,999
A VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT.

676
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,102
IT'S HARD NOT TO GET CHOKED UP.

677
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,504
BUT LINDSEY GRAHAM LOVES JOHN

678
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,004
MCCAIN LIKE A BROTHER.

679
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:33,572
THEY ARE

680
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:33,905
SO TIGHT.

681
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:35,440
AND IT'S JUST AMAZING.

682
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,445
>> HE WAS A MENTOR TOO.

683
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:40,979
WHEN

684
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,347
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS ELECTED TO

685
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,882
THE U.S. SENATE, I BELIEVE IT

686
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:51,556
WAS THE YEAR 2002, HE ATTACHED

687
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:55,060
HIMSELF TO SENATOR MCCAIN.

688
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,226
AND

689
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:56,661
MCCAIN BROUGHT GRAHAM OVERSEAS

690
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,363
AS OUR COUNTRY WAS BATTLING

691
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,231
WARS.

692
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,232
AND SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM

693
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:04,002
WANTED TO ABSORB AS MUCH OF THE

694
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,438
POLICY AND INFLUENCE AS HE COULD

695
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:06,872
FROM MCCAIN.

696
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,605
THEY TRULY BONDED

697
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:10,442
IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP.

698
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,476
THE WAR AND

699
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,310
TRAVELLING OVERSEAS TOGETHER.

700
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,912
>> AND I'M THINKING ABOUT THE

701
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,648
GANG OF EIGHT BILL, THE

702
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,215
BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION BILL,

703
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,717
DIDN'T WIN A LOT OF FRIENDS ON

704
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,587
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, VERY

705
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,020
CONTROVERSIAL BILL.

706
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,454
THEY WENT

707
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,422
THROUGH IT, YOU KNOW?

708
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,389
AND THAT

709
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,358
SHOWS THE KIND OF FIERCE LOYALTY

710
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,726
AND THE TOUGHNESS OF JOHN MCCAIN

711
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,960
AND THE LOYALTY AND THE BOND

712
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,129
BETWEEN LINDSEY GRAHAM AND MR.

713
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:31,363
MCCAIN.

714
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:37,235
>> MORE REACTION IS POURING IN

715
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:54,853
TONIGHT.

716
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,088
>> HE ADDED HE WAS HONORED TO

717
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,523
KNOW HIM AND WILL CONTINUE TO

718
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,825
WORK ON ISSUES THAT WERE WELL

719
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:00,525
KNOWN TO HIM.

720
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:24,716
>>> GODSPEED, SENATOR McCAIN. 

721
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,717
MY PRAYERS FOR CINDY AND THE 

722
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,719
BEAUTIFUL McCAIN FAMILY. 

723
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,223
>> I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A FULL 

724
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,325
SCREEN MADE OF THIS BUT YOU CAN 

725
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,393
COME BACK TO THE STUDIO BECAUSE 

726
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,494
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT 

727
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,528
FROM HIS GOOD FRIEND ON THE 

728
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,596
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. 

729
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:37,996
JOE BIDEN. 

730
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:48,206
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. H 

731
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,574
-- A POND OF GUYS WHO WERE TWO 

732
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,242
TRUE BEST FRIENDS. 

733
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,443
>> I WANT TO READ THIS YEAR. 

734
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,611
JOHN McCAIN WAS MANY THINGS, A 

735
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,578
PROUD GRADUATE OF THE NAVAL 

736
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,479
ACADEMY, A SENATE COLLEAGUE, A 

737
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,914
POLITICAL OPPONENT BUT MORE 

738
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:56,848
THAN ANYTHING, HE WILL BE 

739
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:57,215
MISSED DEARLY. 

740
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,383
>> ONE OF THE BONDS THAT THEY 

741
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,685
SHARED TOGETHER, JOE BIDEN'S 

742
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,920
SON, BEAU, DIED OF THE EXACT 

743
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,824
SAME BRAIN TUMOR.  

744
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,491
THAT WAS THE CONNECTION. 

745
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,325
BECAUSE MEGHAN McCAIN HAS SAID 

746
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:14,433
ON MULTIPLE COUNTS  THAT JOE 

747
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,267
BIDEN HAS TURNED INTO A 

748
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,134
SECONDARY FATHER AND HAS TRULY 

749
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,335
HELPED MEGHAN McCAIN AND THE 

750
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:18,603
McCAIN FAMILY GET THROUGH THIS 

751
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,239
TIME.  

752
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,541
MEGHAN SAID SHE WOULD CALL ON 

753
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,508
JOE BIDEN ALL THE TIME SAYING, 

754
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,643
HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH THIS? 

755
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:25,310
GIVE ME SOME HELP. 

756
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,078
GIVE ME SOME PERSPECTIVE.  

757
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:27,979
>> A TRULY EMOTIONA MOMENT, 

758
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,681
WHEN JOE BIDEN APPEARED ON HER 

759
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:36,621
MORNING TALKSHOW. 

760

00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,029
HE WAS A MUSLIM. 

944
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,197
AND HE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED HER 

945
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,801
AND SAID, NO, MA'AM, NO, MA'AM. 

946
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,702
AGAIN, EXCUSE ME, WE ARE 

947
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,170
SHOWING YOU THESE LIVE PICTURES 

948
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,006
RIGHT NOW. 

949
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,408
THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE 

950
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:56,775
THE MOTORCADE. 

951
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,642
FROM MY PRODUCERS WHO ARE 

952
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,710
FEEDING ME THIS POSITION, IS 

953
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,246
THIS MOTOR COUNTRY FROM HIS 

954
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,147
RANCH? IT IS. 

955
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:02,981
THESE ARE PICTURES COMING FROM 

956
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,215
THE McCAIN RANCH. 

957
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,316
SENATOR KYLE, I DON'T KNOW IF 

958
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:09,154
YOU ARE WATCHING 3TV AT YOUR 

959
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,989
HOME RIGHT NOW BUT THERE IS A 

960
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,826
LARGE MOTORCADE  THAT APPEARS 

961
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,660
TO EITHER BE LEAVING OR 

962
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,361
ENTERING THE COMPOUND, THE 

963
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,362
McCAIN COMPOUND UP IN 

964
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:17,662
CORNVILLE.  

965
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,563
THAT IS WHERE THE SENATOR 

966
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:23,535
PASSED AWAY EARLIER THIS 

967
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:28,206
AFTERNOON. 

968
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,140
LET'S KEEP THESE LIVE PICTURES 

969
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,373
GOING. 

970
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:30,274
SENATOR, BACK TO THE STORY 

971
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:31,843
ABOUT HOWHE CUT OFF THAT WOMAN 

972
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,844
AT THE TOWN HALL AND GOES, NO, 

973
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,944
MA'AM, HE IS NOT A MUSLIM. 

974
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:35,647
HE IS OF GOOD CHRISTIAN FAITH. 

975
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:36,681
HE IS A FAMILY MAN. 

976
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,615
WE JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE 

977
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,316
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES ON THE 

978
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,087
ISSUES OF THIS COUNTRY BUT I'LL 

979
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,020
NEVER FORGET WHEN SENATOR 

980
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,122
McCAIN SAYS OBAMA IS A DECENT 

981
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,289
MAN AND THAT ALWAYS STOOD OUT 

982
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:45,724
TO ME. 

983
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,025
BECAUSE AS SENATOR JEFF FLAKE 

984
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,227
SAID, HE ALWAYS SAW THE BEST IN 

985
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:49,794
HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS. 

986
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:54,132
WHAT CAN YOU ADD ON THAT? 

987
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:54,899
>> THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT. 

988
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,967
AND I HEARD WHAT SENATOR FLAKE 

989
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:56,167
SAID. 

990
00:28:56,167 --> 00:29:00,038
HE IS EXACTLY RIGHT. 

991
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,205
AND I KNOW THAT'S A FAMOUS BIT 

992
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:02,507
OF FILM AND A GOOD THING TO 

993
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,808
KEEP IN YOUR FILE BECAUSE IT 

994
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,009
DOES ILLUSTRATE THE WAY THAT 

995
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:05,877
JOHN APPROACHED HIS CAMPAIGNS 

996
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,011
AND THE WAY THAT HE APPROACHED 

997
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:07,211
LIFE. 

998
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:13,585
HE WAS A PERSON, HE WAS NOT 

999
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,819
GOING TO LET ANYBODY TRY TO 

1000
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:15,653
SCORE INAPPROPRIATE POINTS ON 

1001
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,988
THINGS THAT HE JUST THAT WERE 

1002
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,823
NOT PROPER DISCOURSE. 

1003
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,391
AND THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF 

1004
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,562
EXACTLY WHAT HE FELT. 

1005
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,763
I CAN REMEMBER HIM COMING ON 

1006
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,533
THE SENATE FLOOR, AND SAYING, 

1007
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,268
LOOK, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 

1008
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,371
SITUATION HERE, THESE DEMOCRATS 

1009
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,772
DESERVE A VOTE ON WHATEVER IT 

1010
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:35,974
WAS THEY WERE TRYING TO GET A 

1011
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:36,307
VOTE ON. 

1012
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:46,651
I CAN REMEMBER HIM DOING THAT. 

1013
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,886
SO, HE WAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN 

1014
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:48,686
HIS CRITICISM, AND HIS SUPPORT. 

1015
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,787
>> AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS KNOWN 

1016
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:50,555
HIM PROFESSIONALLY AND HE 

1017
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,456
WORKED ALONGSIDE HIM I BELIEVE 

1018
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,359
YOU SAID FOR 18 YEARS, SENATOR 

1019
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,727
KYL,  YOU SEE THE CURRENT STATE 

1020
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,895
OF POLITICS THAT WE ARE LIVING 

1021
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,495
IN RIGHT NOW. 

1022
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,563
ONE OF THE BIGGEST BOATS THAT 

1023
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,931
WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY WHEN WE 

1024
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,834
ALL REFLECT BACK ON SENATOR 

1025
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,035
McCAIN WITH THE OBAMA CARE VOTE 

1026
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,170
WHERE HE GAVE THE THUMBS DOWN 

1027
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:05,803
ON THE SENATE FLOOR. 

1028
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:06,604
AND HE DID. 

1029
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:07,906
YOU KNOW, SENATOR McCAIN  WOULD 

1030
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,140
OFTEN TIMES GET BEAT UP BY 

1031
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,141
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY, BY 

1032
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:17,649
REPUBLICANS IN GENERAL. 

1033
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,616
AND ESPECIALLY, IT HAS GOTTEN 

1034
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,951
THAT WAY OVER THE PAST YEAR OR 

1035
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:20,318
TWO. 

1036
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,252
I'M JUST WONDERING AS YOU ARE 

1037
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,353
SITTING THERE ON THE SIDELINES 

1038
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,755
NOW AS A FORMER SENATOR FROM 

1039
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,924
ARIZONA, AND I KNOW THAT YOU 

1040
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:26,924
ARE OBSERVING ALL OF THIS 

1041
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:27,992
STUFF, HAT HAS BEEN SOME OF 

1042
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,127
THE FEELINGS YOU'VE SEEN OVER 

1043
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,061
THE PRESS COVERAGE OR SOME OF 

1044
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,629
THE STATEMENS BEING MADE BY 

1045
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,296
MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN 

1046
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:32,529
PARTY? 

1047
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,398
AGAINST SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. 

1048
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,799
AND JUST YOUR REFLECTION ON 

1049
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:34,999
THAT. 

1050
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,870
>> WELL, JOHN DIDN'T ALWAYS 

1051
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,038
ADHERE TO THE PARTY LINE, AND 

1052
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,873
DID NOT ALWAYS VOTE WITH ALL OF 

1053
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,741
HIS COLLEAGUES. 

1054
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:44,842
HE AND I HAD SOME 

1055
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:45,209
DISAGREEMENTS. 

1056
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,244
ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS I 

1057
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,180
REMEMBER IN THE SENATE IS, I 

1058
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,448
HAD ONLY BEEN THERE THREE OR 

1059
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:50,748
FOUR DAYS. 

1060
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,816
I WENT DOWN TO BOAT AND 

1061
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:52,884
REALIZED HE HAD ALREADY VOTED. 

1062
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:58,523
AND BEFORE I VOTED, I WAS GOING 

1063
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,058
TO VOTE YES AND I SEE YOU VOTED 

1064
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:00,258
NO. 

1065
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,560
AND HE JUST -- 

1066
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:12,003
>> YEAH, YEAH. 

1067
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,671
>> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT 

1068
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:14,338
OF DISAGREEMENTS. 

1069
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:15,306
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE WAY I 

1070
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,541
VOTED, YOU BOUGHT THE WAY YOU 

1071
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:16,774
VOTED. 

1072
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:17,408
SOMETIMES WE VOTED DIFFERENTLY 

1073
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,376
AND I WOULD HAVE VOTED 

1074
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,043
DIFFERENTLY ON THAT PARTICULAR 

1075
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:19,243
BOAT. 

1076
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:20,011
IT DID NOT MATTER. 

1077
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,645
HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT IS RIGHT 

1078
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:23,214
AND, HE AND I, WHILE WE MAY 

1079
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,148
HAVE HAD OUR PRIVATE 

1080
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,318
DISAGREEMENTS, WE DID NOT LET 

1081
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,453
THAT INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY 

1082
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,553
TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF 

1083
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:30,655
ARIZONA. 

1084
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,522
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I THINK 

1085
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,524
WE DID A VERY GOOD JOB AS A 

1086
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:37,195
TEAM. 

1087
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,696
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, CAN YOU 

1088
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,998
TALK TO US ABOUT THE MAVERICK 

1089
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:40,231
LEGACY? 

1090
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,968
DO YOU THINK THERE IS A FAIR 

1091
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:44,869
LEGACY FOR THIS MAN? 

1092
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,636
OBVIOUSLY HE DID PICK HIS 

1093
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:46,604
MOMENTS WHERE HE BUCKED THE 

1094
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,539
PARTY BUT HE WAS A REPUBLICAN 

1095
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,442
MAN THROUGH AND THROUGH. 

1096
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,310
>> HE WAS BOTH. 

1097
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,111
ELECT THE PHRASE MAVERICK AND 

1098
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,545
AT ONE POINT SAID, NO, NO, I'M 

1099
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,314
NOT REALLY A MAVERICK. 

1100
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,615
BUT HE WAS AND I THINK YOU 

1101
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,316
WOULD AGREE TO THAT. 

1102
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,684
HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS BEST 

1103
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,885
AND, YOU KNOW, DAMN THE 

1104
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:01,218
CONSEQUENCES. 

1105
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:08,893
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE DID NOT TELL 

1106
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:09,761
THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA ANY 

1107
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,061
DIFFERENT. 

1108
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,329
HE SAID, THIS IS WHO I AM AND 

1109
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,331
IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT ME, I 

1110
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,499
WILL DO WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT 

1111
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,666
AND I WILL COME BACK AND 

1112
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:23,474
EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY. 

1113
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:24,609
>> SENATOR KYL, THANK YOU SO 

1114
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,443
MUCH FOR SPENDING SOME MOMENTS 

1115
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,744
ON THIS AFTERNOON ON A DAY THAT 

1116
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,812
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GRIEVING AND 

1117
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,313
I KNOW THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY 

1118
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:30,114
ARE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF 

1119
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:30,615
SENATOR McCAIN.  

1120
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,783
THANK YOU FOR CALLING US TODAY 

1121
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,817
AND SHARING SOME OF THOSE 

1122
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:33,417
PERSONAL STORIES REFLECTING

SENATOR JOHN McCAIN FOR 18

00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,193
YEARS. 

1129
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,394
SENATOR KYL,  THANK YOU VERY

00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,269
OR TWO. 

1134
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,470
I WANT TO BRING IN MY GOOD 

1135
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,104
FRIEND FROM "GOOD MORNING 

1136
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,273
ARIZONA" JAVIER SOTO, WHO 

1137
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,976
RECALLED -- WE CALLED LAST 

1138
00:32:58,976 --> 00:32:59,944
MINUTE AS THE NEWS BROKE. 

1139
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,212
YOU'VE BEEN HERE IN THE STATE 

1140
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,146
OF ARIZONA, AND I KNOW YOU'VE 

1141
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,081
HAD YOUR EXPERIENCES OF DEALING 

1142
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:03,915
WITH SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, 

1143
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:04,949
REFLECT BACK ON THE MOMENT THAT 

1144
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:05,817
YOU HEARD THE NEWS FROM 

1145
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,051
YESTERDAY WHEN HE WAS GOING TO 

1146
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,419
STOP TREATMENT AND JUST YOUR 

1147
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,088
REACTION. 

1148
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,122
>> I THINK IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU 

1149
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,623
HEAR THAT THEY WERE GOING TO 

1150
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:23,367
SUSPEND TREATMENT, YOU START 

1151
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:24,268
DRAWING ON SOME OF THOSE 

1152
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:24,535
MEMORIES. 

1153
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,603
AND I THINK ONE OF THE MORE 

1154
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,437
VIVID MEMORIES THAT STICKS OUT 

1155
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,972
TO ME, AND DENNIS, I DON'T KNOW 

1156
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,540
IF YOU WERE AT 3TV YET OR IF 

1157
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,708
YOU WERE THERE COVERING IT AS A 

1158
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,509
NEWSPAPER REPORTER,  BUT, THE 

1159
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,176
2008 CAMPAIGN. 

1160
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:32,876
WHEN HE GAVE HIS ACCEPTANCE 

1161
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:33,110
SPECH. 

1162
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,146
YOU SAW HIM TOWARD THE END OF 

1163
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:35,513
THAT RUN. 

1164
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,280
HE WAS BEAT UP. 

1165
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,915
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS AN UNDERDOG 

1166
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:44,088
IN THAT, BUT HE CONTINUED THAT 

1167
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:44,922
WITH SO MUCH GRACE. 

1168
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,656
AND, THAT LAST CONCESSION 

1169
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,824
SPEECH THAT HE GAVE WITH SO 

1170
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:47,925
MUCH GRACE RIGHT IN FRONT OF 

1171
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,393
HIS HOME CROWD THERE AT THE 

1172
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:50,695
BILTMORE. 

1173
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,762
>> AND YOU JUST KNEW WHAT KIND 

1174
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:52,663
OF MAN HE WAS. 

1175
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,498
HE WANTED TO WIN. 

1176
00:33:53,498 --> 00:34:00,638
AND HE OFTEN JOKED ABOUT THAT. 

1177
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,772
HE SAID, HOW DID YOU GET 

1178
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:02,473
THROUGH THE LOSS? 

1179
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,708
AND HE WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW, I 

1180
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,408
CRIED LIKE A BABY. 

1181
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:05,710
I WOULD SLEEP FOR A LITTLE BIT, 

1182
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,878
I WOULD WAKE UP, I'D CRY. 

1183
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,778
THAT BECAME S SIGNATURE JOKE. 

1184
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:08,913
BUT WITH SO MUCH GRACE, AND 

1185
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,547
THEN JUMPED RIGHT BACK INTO IT 

1186
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:15,686
AND SAID, LET'S GET BACK TO 

1187
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,020
WORK. 

1188
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,654
DURING THE CONCESSION SPEECH, 

1189
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:17,755
YOU WILL RECALL HE TRIED TO 

1190
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:18,856
GATHER THE AMERICANS TO SUPPORT 

1191
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,123
PRESIDENT OBAMA, SAYING THIS IS 

1192
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:24,362
ONE AMERICA. 

1193
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,196
WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. 

1194
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,531
>> WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO 

1195
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:26,964
DOWNTOWN PHOENIX. 

1196
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:27,931
WE WERE MENTIONING EARLIER THAT 

1197
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:28,966
GOVERNOR DUCEY SENT OUT A TWEET 

1198
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:29,867
SAYING ALL FLIGHTS WILL BE 

1199
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:30,935
LOWERED AT HALF  STAFF. 

1200
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:31,935
WE HAVE A CREW IN DOWNTOWN 

1201
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:33,004
PHOENIX, MY PRODUCER TELLING US 

1202
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:33,971
THAT ONE OF OUR REPORTERS, 

1203
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:37,175
BREANNA WHITNEY, IS THERE. 

1204
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,742
I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE IN THE 

1205
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:39,409
PROCESS OF LOWERING THE FLAG 

1206
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,545
DOWN AT THE CAPITOL TO HAVE 

1207
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:40,777
STAFF. 

1208
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:44,715
TALK US THROUGH IT. 

1209
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,081
>> THEY ARE. 

1210
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:46,184
HE JUST GOT TO THE CAPITAL 

1211
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:46,417
HERE. 

1212
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:51,088
IS GOING TO GO LOWER, ACTUALLY, 

1213
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,023
WE WERE TALKING TO HIM. 

1214
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,190
HE SAID HE FOUND OUT FROM HIS 

1215
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,125
GRAND DAUGHTER TODAY THAT JOHN 

1216
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,293
McCAIN HAD PASSED AWAY AND IT 

1217
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:59,497
WAS HIS JOB TODAY TO COME OUT 

1218
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,664
HERE AND LOWER THESE FLAGS TO 

1219
00:35:00,664 --> 00:35:01,766
HALF STAFF HERE AT THE CAPITAL 

1220
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,833
AND THE CAPITOL COMPLEX IN THE 

1221
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,233
DOWNTOWN AREA. 

1222
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,936
HE SAYS HE'S BEEN WORKING FOR 

1223
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,471
THE STATE FOR 30 YEARS. 

1224
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,205
SO, YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH HE 

1225
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:13,277
FELT WHEN HE HEARD THAT JOHN 

1226
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,212
McCAIN HAD PASSED AWAY EARLIER 

1227
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:14,445
TODAY. 

1228
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,446
HE'S GOING TO BE DOING THIS 

1229
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,947
AROUND HERE IN THE AREA. 

1230
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,049
NOT A LOT OF ACTIVITY AROUND 

1231
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,183
THE CAPITAL RIGHT NOW BUT WE 

1232
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,117
ARE SEEING MORE PEOPLE STOPPING 

1233
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:21,252
BY AS THEY HEAR ABOUT WHAT'S 

1234
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:21,619
GOING ON. 

1235
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:29,560
SO, RAY JUST FINISHED UP. 

1236
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,595
HE SAID IT'S ALWAYS THE 

1237
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,495
NATIONAL FLAG THAT GOES DOWN 

1238
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:32,563
HALF STAFF LAST, IT'S ALSO THE 

1239
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,231
FLAG THAT GOES UP FIRST IN THE 

1240
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:39,670
MORNING. 

1241
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,738
NONE OF THESE FLAGS CAN BE 

1242
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:41,872
HIGHER THAN OUR NATION'S FLAG. 

1243
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:42,640
HE'S FINISHING UP RIGHT NOW. 

1244
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,941
YOU CAN SEE THE ANGLE WE'VE GOT 

1245
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:44,141
HERE. 

1246
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,511
JUST A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT AT THE 

1247
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:48,579
CAPITAL. 

1248
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,881
WE'VE GOT THE CLOUDS IN THE 

1249
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:50,881
BACKGROUND, WE NOW SEE THESE 

1250
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:51,649
FLAGS AT HALF STAFF, OBVIOUSLY 

1251
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,583
HONORING AN AMERICAN HERO THAT 

1252
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,018
MANY RESPECTED ARIZONA. 

1253
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:54,818
GUYS, BACK TO YOU. 

1254
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:55,753

1255
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,321
LIVE PICTURES INTO OUR NEWSROOM 

1256
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,824
TONIGHT, GOVERNOR DUCEY HAS 

1257
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,791
ORDERED ALL FLAGS ACROSS THE 

1258
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,161
STATE BE LOWERED AT HALF STAFF. 

1259
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,795
WE DO HAVE A COMMENT COMING IN, 

1260
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,165
SOME REACTION FROM FORMER 

1261
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,066
PRESIDENT OBAMA. 

1262
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,368
>> HE JUST TWEETED OUT AND I 

1263
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,502
QUOTE, JOHN McCAIN AND I WERE 

1264
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,603
MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT 

1265
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,704
GENERATIONS. 

1266
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:14,572
CAME FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 

1267
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,473
BACKGROUNDS AND COMPETED AT THE 

1268
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,642
HIGHEST LEVEL OF POLITICS. 

1269
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:20,044
BUT WE SHARED, FOR ALL OF OUR 

1270
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,212
DIFFERENCES, A FIDELITY OF 

1271
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,514
SOMETHING HIGHER. 

1272
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,048
THE IDEALS FOR WHICH 

1273
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:24,815
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS AND 

1274
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,451
IMMIGRANTS ALIKE HAVE FOUGHT, 

1275
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,119
MARCHED, AND SACRIFICED. 

1276
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:33,057
WE SAW OUR POLITICAL BATTLES, 

1277
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:33,991
EVEN AS A PRIVILEGE, SOMETHING 

1278
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:34,925
NOBLE, AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE 

1279
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:41,032
AS STEWARDS OF THOSE HIGH 

1280
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,199
IDEALS AT HOME, AND TO ADVANCE 

1281
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:42,867
THEM AROUND THE WORLD. 

1282
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,135
WE SAW THIS COUNTRY AS A PLACE 

1283
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,103
WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, AND 

1284
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:46,837
CITIZENSHIP AS OUR PATRIOTIC 

1285
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,405
OBLIGATION TO ENSURE IT FOREVER 

1286
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:51,642
REMAINS THAT WAY. 

1287
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,943
FEW OF US HAVE BEEN TESTED THE 

1288
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:54,045
WAY JOHN ONCE WAS ARE REQUIRED 

1289
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,212
TO SHOW THE KIND OF COURAGE 

1290
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,881
THAT HE DID. 

1291
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,415
BUT ALL OF US CAN ASPIRE TO THE 

1292
00:36:58,415 --> 00:36:59,517
COURAGE TO PUT THE GREATER GOOD 

1293
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,084
ABOUT OUR OWN. 

1294
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,185
AT JOHN'S BEST, HE SHOWED US 

1295
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:09,493
WHAT THAT MEANS, AND FOR THAT, 

1296
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,561
WE ARE ALL IN HIS DEBT. 

1297
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,662
MICHELLE AND I SEND OUR MOST 

1298
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,064
HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES TO CINDY 

1299
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:18,269
AND THEIR FAMILY. 

1300
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,737
>> TWO GUYS WHO BATTLED IT OUT

ABOUT, REMINDING VOTERS ABOUT 

1310
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:43,194

WOMAN SAID SHE COULD NOT TRUST 

1312
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,496
BARACK OBAMA BECAUSE HE WAS A 

1313
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:45,729
MUSLIM. 

1314
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:46,731
HE CORRECTED HER ON THAT POINT 

1315
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:47,331

1480
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,442
TWEETING OUT A STATEMENT TODAY, 

1481
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,443
SAYING THIS, ALL OF THE 

1482
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:26,910
POWERFUL ACTIONS AND 

1483
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,711
INFLUENTIAL WORDS OF SENATOR 

1484
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,545
McCAIN'S CAREER BOILED DOWN TO 

1485
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:41,225
A SIMPLE PHRASE, COUNTRY FIRST. 

1486
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:41,925
SHE ADDED, "McCAIN DEDICATED 

1487
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:42,993
HIS LIFE TO KEYWORD TO 

1488
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:43,560
DEFENDING AND ENHANCING OUR 

1489
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:43,860
DEMOCRACY. 

1490
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,595
SENATOR McCAIN PUSHED ASIDE 

1491
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:45,262
PARTISAN POLITICS WHEN IT 

1492
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:45,862
CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

1493
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:46,597
PROCESS AND OUR AMERICAN 

1494
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:46,830
VALUES. 

1495
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:52,402
HE MAY HAVE BEEN MY TOUGHEST 

1496
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:53,170
OPPONENT AT ONE TIME. 

1497
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:53,904
HOWEVER, HIS RESPECT AND 

1498
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,604
DEDICATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE 

1499
00:42:54,604 --> 00:42:55,873
AND HIS LOVE FOR ARIZONA IS 

1500
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:56,607
SOMETHING I STRONGLY ADMIRE." 

1501
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,808
SHE ALSO GOES ON TO SAY THAT 

1502
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,009
THE STATE OF ARIZONA IS SO 

1503
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:00,110
LUCKY TO HAVE HIM REPRESENT ALL 

1504
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:00,577
OF US. 

1505
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:06,050
REST IN PEACE, MAVERICK. 

1506
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:06,850
>> SO VERY TRUE. 

1507
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,918
WE ARE ALSO GETTING WORD RIGHT 

1508
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,119
NOW FROM THE SPEAKER OF THE 

1509
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:09,620
HOUSE, JD MESSNER. 

1510
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,422
AND HE SENT OUT THIS TWEET 

1511
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:16,960
SAYING, "ARIZONA HAS LOST A 

1512
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,427
RELENTLESS WARRIOR. 

1513
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:18,562
OUR NATION HAS LOST A STEADFAST 

1514
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:19,630
DEFENDER AND THE WORLD HAS LOST 

1515
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,364
A BEACON OF DEMOCRACY. 

1516
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,498
HE FIERCELY FOUGHT TO PROTECT 

1517
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,199
AND EXPAND FREEDOM AROUND THE 

1518
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,300
GLOBE, AND HIS LEGACY IS A 

1519
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,701
LIFETIME OF COURAGE AND PUBLIC 

1520
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:33,243
SERVICE. 

1521
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:33,810
#RESTINPEACE, JOHN McCAIN." 

1522
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,712
>> THESE ARE TWO OPPONENTS ON 

1523
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,214
FAR POLITICAL SIZE OF THE 

1524
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,116
SPECTRUM.  

1525
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,417
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, REALLY 

1526
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,318
STRONG WORDS AND ELEGANT WORDS 

1527
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,187
FROM A MAN, FROM BOTH SIDES OF 

1528
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:43,654
THE AISLE. 

1529
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,154
THESE ARE AUTHENTIC. 

1530
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,088
THESE ARE NOT JUST TRITE 

1531
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:45,823
PLATITUDES THAT THEY ARE 

1532
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:46,290
TWEETING OUT. 

1533
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:52,395
THIS IS VERY AUTHENTIC. 

1534
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:53,497
I READ A TWEET, AND I'M 

1535
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,465
PARAPHRASING FROM A "NEW YORK 

1536
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,299
TIMES" REPORTER. 

1537
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,067
HE SAID BASICALLY, JOHN McCAIN 

1538
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,435
WASN'T PERFECT BUT THE THING 

1539
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:59,370
THAT MADE HIM GREAT WAS, HE 

1540
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:06,310
KNEW HE WASN'T. 

1541
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,377
>> HE ADMITTED IT OFTEN TIMES. 

1542
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:08,245
>> AN IMPERFECT MAN. 

1543
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,279
>> HE ADMITTED IT OFTEN TIMES. 

1544
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,547
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD THE 

1545
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,482
OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH THE HBO 

1546
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,216
SPECIAL THAT THEY DID ON HIM, A 

1547
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:14,885
BIOGRAPHY. 

1548
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:15,819
"JOHN McCAIN" FOR WHOM THE 

1549
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,223
BELLS WILL POLE." 

1550
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,758
ANYHOW, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 

1551
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:21,825
WHEN HE WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE, AND 

1552
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:31,001
HOW HE CHOSE TO STAY IN, 

1553
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,102
BECAUSE HE KNEW THEY WOULD USE 

1554
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,069
IT FOR PROPAGANDA, OFTEN TIMES 

1555
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:34,004
ASKING HIM AND REMINDING HIM 

1556
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:34,905
AND QUESTIONING HIM, WHO IS 

1557
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:35,506
YOUR FATHER AGAIN? 

1558
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,507
WHO IS YOUR FATHER AGAIN? 

1559
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,741
BUT HE SAYS WHEN HE ACCEPTED 

1560
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,510
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR 

1561
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,744
PRESIDENT, MY COUNTRY SAVED ME 

1562
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:41,812
AND I CANNOT FORGET IT. 

1563
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:45,849
I WILL FIGHT FOR HER AS LONG AS 

1564
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,317
I DRAW A BREATH, SO HELP ME 

1565
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:47,517
GOD. 

1566
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:48,452
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW HE LIVED 

1567
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:48,919
HIS LIFE. 

1568
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,255
AND IT TALKS ABOUT HOW, 

1569
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,222
REMEMBER, THIS WAS THE GRANDSON 

1570
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,258
AND THE SON OF A NAVAL OFFICER. 

1571
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,959
AND WHEN YOU SERVE TO THAT 

1572
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,861
HIGHEST DEGREE, HONOR IS THE 

1573
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:02,633
BOTTOM LINE THERE. 

1574
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,834
>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 

1575
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:04,568
EXPECTATIONS OF BEING THE 

1576
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,436
GRANDSON AND THE SON OF TWO 

1577
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:08,505
NAVY ADMIRALS, THE EXPECTATIONS 

1578
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,840
PUT UPON YOU, I THINK YOU CAN 

1579
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,941
LOOK BACK AND SEE THAT HE 

1580
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:14,111
EXCEEDED THOSE EXPECTATIONS. 

1581
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,713
>> GROWING UP, HE WAS A BIT OF 

1582
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:15,979
A REBEL. 

1583
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,114
>> HE WAS A REBEL BEING 

1584
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,015
INVOLVED AS A MAVERICK. 

1585
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,317
HE ALWAYS HAD A REBEL IN HIM. 

1586
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:25,622
AND HE ENJOYED IT. 

1587
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:26,356
HE ENJOYED RUFFLING THE 

1588
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,457
FEATHERS, A THE CAPITAL AND IN 

1589
00:45:27,457 --> 00:45:31,195
CONGRESS, AND THINGS AND SUCH. 

1590
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,362
BUT AS YOU SO MENTIONED, THAT 

1591
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:32,896
IS HIS LIFE. 

1592
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,231
WHAT WE SAW AS A PRISONER OF 

1593
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:39,102
WAR AND HIM SAYING, NO, DO NOT 

1594
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:40,137
LET HIM RELEASE ME UNLESS YOU 

1595
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,505
ARE GOING TO RELEASE ALL OF MY 

1596
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:41,772
MEN. 

1597
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,073
HE WAS GOING TO STAY IN THE 

1598
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:43,740
TRENCHES WITH HIS MEN. 

1599
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,942
THAT IS THE TRUE EMBODIMENT OF 

1600
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,009
THE MAN WHO SENATOR JOHN McCAIN 

1601
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:46,276
IS. 

1602
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,213
BY THE WAY,  JOHN McCAIN FIRST 

1603
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:49,947
BECAME KNOWN TO AMERICANS WHEN 

1604
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,115
HE WAS TAKEN AGAIN AS A 

1605
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,482
PRISONER OF WAR IN VIETNAM. 

1606
00:45:52,482 --> 00:46:02,159
>> A REPORTER TRAVEL TO HANOI 

1607
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,260
AND FOUND McCAIN TICKET TIME IS

1611

HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF HANOI 

1612
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,133
AROUND US. 

1613
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:11,068
THIS IS WHERE JOHN McCAIN 

1614
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:11,501
CRASHED IN 1967. 

1615
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:12,803
HE WAS ON A MISSION, TRYING TO 

1616
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:13,971
TAKE DOWN A POWER PLANT OUTSIDE 

1617
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:17,441
OF HANOI WHEN HIS PLANE WAS HIT.

1618
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,742
HE ENDED UP HERE SHOOTING INTO 

1619
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:19,042
THIS LAKE. 

1620
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:19,877
HE WAS BADLY INJURED. 

1621
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,145
HE HAD A NUMBER OF BROKEN BONES 

1622
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,379
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 

1623
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,513
HAPPENED TO BE IN THIS AREA SAW 

1624
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:24,448
HIM LAND IN THE WATER. 

1625
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,849
THEY DID NOT TRY TO HELP HIM. 

1626
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:26,984
THEY BEAT HIM SEVERELY AND THEN 

1627
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,786
PULLED HIM OUT OF THE WATER. 

1628
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,053
McCAIN WAS TAKEN ON A SHORT 

1629
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:30,787
DRIVE THROUGH WHAT ARE NOW 

1630
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:34,558
KNOWN AS CRAZY, CROWDED STREETS 

1631
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:37,227
IN HANOI, TO A NEARBY PRISON, 

1632
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:41,298
WHICH U.S. P.O.W.s NICKNAMED, 

1633
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:41,698
THE HANOI HILTON. 

1634
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,866
MOST OF THE OLD PRISON COMPLEX 

1635
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,602
HAS BEEN TORN DOWN.  

1636
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,837
THE REMAINING PART HAS BEEN 

1637
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,437
TURNED INTO A MUSEUM WHICH 

1638
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:48,605
REALLY WHITE WASHES OVER A LOT 

1639
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:49,573
OF THE TORTURE AND MISTREATMENT 

1640

HIS GEAR IS DAMAGED, BUT INTACT 

1645
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,050
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. 

1646
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,420
IT'S ENCASED IN A ROOM FULL OF 

1647
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,989
VIETNAMESE PROPAGANDA.

SPENT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. 

1654
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:21,605
WHEN THE NORTH VIETNAMESE 

1655
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,572
REALIZED HIS FATHER HAD BEEN 

1656
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:28,211
ELEVATED TO A NAVAL COMMANDER, 

1657
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:29,279
THEY OFFERED TO RELEASE McCAIN. 

1658
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,480
HE REFUSED TO LEAVE THE OTHER 

1659
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,181
P.O.W.s BEHIND AND ENDED UP 

1660
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,951
SPENDING FIVE AND HALF YEARS  

1661
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:34,384
BEHIND THIS PRISON. 

1662
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,485
>> Reporter: SOME OF THESE 

1663
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,053
SMALL, DARK CELLS WERE 

1664
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:36,854
PRESERVED. 

1665
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,755
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER McCAIN 

1666
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,190
SPENT ANY TIME IN ANY OF THE 

1667
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,227
CELLS, WHICH STILL STAND HERE 

1668
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,595
TODAY. 

1669
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:46,630
JOHN McCAIN FIRST RETURNED HERE 

1670
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,864
IN 1985 AND HE HAS COME BACK 

1671
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:48,832
MANY TIMES THROUGH THE YEARS 

1672
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,701
AND HAS BECOME A HUGE PROPONENT 

1673
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,468
OF OPENING UP RELATIONS BETWEEN 

1674
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,870
VIETNAM AND THE UNITED STATES. 

1675
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,538
AND BACK HERE AT THE LAKE 

1676
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:56,840
McCAIN PARACHUTE, THERE IS ONE 

1677
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,509
MEMORIAL TO HIM. 

1678
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:00,978
HIS NAME IS RIGHT HERE ON THIS 

1679
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:04,548
MEMORIAL ON ONE OF THE BRIDGES. 

1680
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,882
THIS LAKE IS A BEAUTIFUL SPOT, 

1681
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,217
AGAIN, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF 

1682
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,186
HANOI. 

1683
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,487
IT IS SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF 

1684
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,354
FAMILIES IN DIFFERENT PARKS, A 

1685
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:12,055
LOT OF RESTAURANTS. 

1686
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,257
A LOT HAS CHANGED HERE IN THE 

1687
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:16,760
LAST 50 YEARS. 

1688
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,861
IN HANOI, VIETNAM, I'M JERRY 

1689
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:18,661
DEALING HIM FOR ARIZONA'S 

1690
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:18,895
FAMILY. 

1691
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:27,404
>> WHAT A FASCINATING STORY. 

1692
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,538
WHEN JERRY DEALING HIM TOLD OUR 

1693
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:29,573
BOSSES HE WAS HEADING TO 

1694
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,707
VIETNAM AND HE GOT THERE AND 

1695
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:31,508
SAID, FOLKS, THERE IS AN 

1696
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,611
INCREDIBLE MUSEUM, DESIGNATED TO

1697
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,913
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND WHAT HE 

1698
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,313
WENT THROUGH. 

1699
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:37,748
I GOT TO SHOOT A STORY ON THAT. 

1700
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,284
THAT IS THE STORY HE FILED. 

1701
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,484
>> GREAT WORK THERE BUT IT ALSO 

1702
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:43,219
SHOWS, WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE 

1703
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:46,857
MADE FRIENDS. 

1704
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:47,457
HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES. 

1705
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,291
LOOK, HE LED THE WAY. 

1706
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,192
JOHN McCAIN WAS VERY INSTRUMENT 

1707
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,127
IN NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH 

1708
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:50,727
VIETNAM AFTER THAT REALLY 

1709
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,895
CONTENTIOUS CHAPTER, AND DARK 

1710
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:55,365
CHAPTER. 

1711
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,566
BOTH HE AND JOHN KERRY DID 

1712
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:56,833
THAT. 

1713
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,437
THEY LED THE WAY ON THAT. 

1714
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,538
>> YOU KNOW, THAT TALKS ABOUT 

1715
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,106
HOW HE CONTINUED TO REACH 

1716
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:03,640
ACROSS THE AISLE. 

1717
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,308
HERE IS JOHN KERRY, HERE IS 

1718
00:49:05,308 --> 00:49:07,210
JOHN McCAIN. 

1719
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,011
THEY BOTH STOOD ON DIFFERENT 

1720
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,515
SIDES OF THE VIETNAM WAR, AND 

1721
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,649
THEY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO 

1722
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:13,750
FORGE IT FORWARD AND THEY WERE 

1723
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:18,221
GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. 

1724
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,356
AND, AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY 

1725
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,557
CALLED A DARK PLACE IN HISTORY. 

1726
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,493
AND, JOHN McCAIN APPARENTLY 

1727
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:24,494
GOING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

1728
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:25,761
SAYING, LISTEN, I'M TIRED OF 

1729
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:31,201
THIS STAYING NOT ONLY ON THE 

1730
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:32,502
COUNTRY BUT MY LIFE AS WELL. 

1731
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,069
THAT'S WHEN CHANGE GAME. 

1732
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:35,372
>> THAT'S A MUTUAL RESPECT 

1733
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:39,242
BETWEEN SENATOR JOHN KERRY AND 

1734
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,177
JOHN McCAIN, SAYING, WE BOTH 

1735
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:45,649
SERVED OUR COUNTRY VERY PROUDLY.

1736
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,616
WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT 

1737
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:47,517
FUNDAMENTAL VIEWS OF WHERE WE 

1738
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,685
WANT THIS COUNTRY TO GO BUT 

1739
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:49,686
LET'S FIND OURSELVES IN THE 

1740
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:50,687
COMMONALITY OF WHAT WE 54 IN 

1741
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:56,326
THIS COUNTRY AND THE LOVE FOR 

1742
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:56,760
THIS COUNTRY. 

1743
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,928
JOHN McCAIN SAID, IF WE FOCUS, 

1744
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,029
ALL OF US HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES. 

1745
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,097
BUT IF WE FOCUS ON OUR 

1746
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,098
SIMILARITIES AND THE LOVE WE 

1747
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,099
HAVE FOR THIS COUNTRY, WE CAN 

1748
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,300
WORK TOGETHER AND GET SOMETHING 

1749
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,500
DONE. 

1750
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,201
THAT'S THE LEGACY THAT JOHN 

1751
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:04,901
McCAIN ALWAYS PREACHED. 

1752
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:05,735
WE CAN HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES. 

1753
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:09,439
LET'S FIND THE THINGS WE AGREE 

1754
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:10,841
ON AND TRY TO WORK TOGETHER. 

1755
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,541
>> IN THE ENORMITY OF 

1756
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:15,078
EVERYTHING THAT IS JOHN McCAIN, 

1757
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,045
SOMETIMES YOU FORGET ALL THE 

1758
00:50:16,045 --> 00:50:16,746
THINGS THAT HE DID. 

1759
00:50:16,746 --> 00:50:17,614
I THINK NORMALIZING RELATIONS 

1760
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,749
HEALED THE WOUND AGAIN. 

1761
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:20,884
THAT WAS A DARK CHAPTER IN 

1762
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:21,318
AMERICAN LIFE. 

1763
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,652
HE NEARLY TORE THE COUNTRY 

1764
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:25,722
APART. 

1765
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:26,556
AND I THINK NORMALIZING THOSE 

1766
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,724
RELATIONSHIPS DID A LOT TO HEAL 

1767
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,126
THE COUNTRY AND MEANT A LOT TO 

1768
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,194
THE PEOPLE THAT SERVED OVER 

1769
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,195

1770
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,263

HE WAS A HERO. 

1795
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,076
AS HIS MANY YEARS OF SERVICE 

1796
