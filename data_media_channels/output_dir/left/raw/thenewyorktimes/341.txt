1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,810
In a remote part
of Afghanistan —

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,740
a US military outpost.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,200
In the middle of Niger

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,620
the outlines of an expanded
base and airstrip.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,880
In Syria,

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,370
exercise routines and
possible patrolling routes

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,030
on a base where American
special forces trained.

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,100
By design, these secretive
locations are supposed

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,260
to be difficult to spot.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,810
But a heat map posted
online by Strava,

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,630
a company that tracks
people’s exercise routes,

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,310
has inadvertently put these places
on public display

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,400
for all the world to see.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,850
Many of the military
bases are already well known,

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,990
like Bagram
and Kandahar air fields

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,010
in Afghanistan.

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,010
And the material
we’re revealing here

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,320
doesn’t go beyond anything
that isn’t already available

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,610
on the open web.

20
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,940
But Strava’s platform has
drawn attention in a new way

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,240
to the activity of military
personnel in far flung outposts

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,400
and has laid bare some
loopholes in the security

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,900
of military bases.

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,220
How did this happen?

25
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,200
Strava is an app
and social network

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,180
that connects with
devices like Fitbit

27
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,880
and is used to log workouts.

28
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,665
It’s popular with U.S. soldiers
and others stationed abroad

29
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:09,040
and the Pentagon has distributed
several thousand of them

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
to its personnel.

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,740
They use it to
track their exercise

32
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,350
routines and everyday activities
like walks or patrols.

33
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,570
But it also tracks
users' locations,

34
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,540
and in November 2017

35
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,400
the company updated
a map showing over

36
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,580
1 billion activities and
3 trillion GPS points.

37
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,930
Twenty-year-old international
security student Nathan Ruser

38
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,750
was the first to point out how
Strava’s map could compromise

39
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,940
operational security.

40
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,460
The map alone doesn’t
show the complete picture

41
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,640
and its satellite
images are outdated,

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,420
but it does tell
you where to look.

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,220
So by combining it
with recent satellite

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,430
imagery and other reporting, we
get a clearer sense of what’s

45
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,930
happening on the ground.

46
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,530
Take this new U.S. Air
Force Base in Sarrin, Syria.

47
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,590
The map shows workouts are
walking routes — activities that

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,290
provide a clear blueprint of the
base and by tracing the lines,

49
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,730
we can follow soldiers to a
newly set up helicopter pad.

50
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,740
Here’s what else we found.

51
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,100
A new compound at a French
military site in Mali,

52
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,190
Strava highlighted the camp
in the first place

53
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,950
and no other mapping
platforms had marked the site.

54
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,920
These U.S. forward operating
bases in Afghanistan.

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,190
The location of a U.S. drone
base under construction

56
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,170
in Agadez, Niger, and various
military facilities in Djibouti,

57
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,180
where the U.S. is fighting
extremist groups

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,220
in the Horn of Africa.

59
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,690
And there are some
mysterious sites

60
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,500
that we can’t yet identify.

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,510
An area in the middle

62
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,570
of the Nigerian desert.

63
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,800
Two remote locations surrounded
by sand barriers in Yemen

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,150
And here’s an unusual activity
in the desert in Mauritania

65
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,590
that led us to a
suspected military site,

66
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,420
including an extended
airstrip nearby.

67
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,070
Strava also allows users
to share photos

68
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,470
and workout routes.

69
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,491
It’s basically
Facebook for athletes.

70
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:54,990
This allows everyone
with an account

71
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,880
to see who is working out
where.

72
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,990
For example,
the “King of the Camp” run

73
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,470
at a U.S. military base
in Iraq,

74
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,410
or the
“Embassy River Wall Segment”

75
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,920
in Baghdad’s green zone,

76
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,280
or the perimeter base run
where more than 15 individuals

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,470
stationed at a U.S. military base
challenge themselves.

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,760
We found photos posted by users
from inside military bases

79
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,510
and the online profiles
of several U.S. service members

80
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,250
stationed at one
base near Mosul in Iraq.

81
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,770
A Pentagon spokeswoman
said that this data release

82
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,360
emphasized the
need for personnel

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,980
to have situational awareness.

84
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,400
And it’s assessing if any
additional training or guidance

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,164
is required.

86
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,330
There are some areas where
people presumably are not

87
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,410
allowed to bring their
cellphones.

88
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,870
User activity at C.I.A.

89
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,690
and N.S.A. headquarters, 
for instance, can be seen

90
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,170
around the perimeters,
but not beyond certain points

91
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,730
inside the structure.

92
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,530
But out in the remote
corners of the world

93
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,600
where the U.S. military
is operating,

94
00:03:51,600 --> 00:00:00,000
there’s plenty to see.
