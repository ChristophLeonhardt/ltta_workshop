thousands of people at Google have called on the tech giant to cancel its cooperation with a Pentagon artificial intelligence project in a letter to google's chief executive the employees pointed out that involvement in the business of war could harm the company's reputation whose motto is don't be evil we believe that Google should not be in the business of war therefore we ask that project maven be cancelled building this technology to assist the US government in military surveillance and potentially lethal outcomes is not acceptable project maven is described by Google employees as a customized artificial intelligence engine it's said to detect and track objects in images provided by US government drones and sends the results to the Pentagon and while Google's management described the project as non offensive in nature the tech giant's involvement with the Pentagon has still led to divisions inside the company the military link was first reported last month and the employees les also points out that it could damage Google's brand and its ability to compete for talent first despite competitors like Amazon and Microsoft already being involved with defense contracts Google's former boss Eric Schmidt has been head of the Pentagon's defense innovation advisory board since 2016 and while defense expert mark goo bird says it's admirable that Google's employees are defending the company's core ideal he adds it's unlikely to change the corporation's plans it's very exciting to see a movement arise among Google employees of concern that their company's contribution and the world's drift towards autonomous weapons I'm not so sure that you know this letter or if Google does what the letter asked them to do in any way sever its involvement in this project maven how big of a difference that's going to make to the Pentagon's efforts I can't really say they're using open source software that Google makes available to anybody so somebody else could just come along and use the Google software and and other resources to do the same kind of work for the Pentagon but I think it's still very important to see this kind of a statement being made by the employees of Google we requested a comment on the story from Google and the company's spokesperson told us that conversations about new technologies with employees are hugely important and beneficial the statement also pointed out once again that the technology in question is non offensive and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do tedious work
