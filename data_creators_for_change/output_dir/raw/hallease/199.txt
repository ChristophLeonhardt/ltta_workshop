00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,089
yo Veda what's up so today's the this

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,500
and today's topic is do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,019
you give good advice / do you like

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,680
getting advice and giving advice advice

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,090
everywhere and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth um by</font>

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,369
the way is my break from work I have to

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,619
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work after they make this</font>

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,220
quick video uh I like giving advice I

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,520
like helping my friends if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need</font>

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,469
that I find that when I'm giving advice

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:35,880
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just doing is listening</font>

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,129
feel like someone people just need

13
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,340
someone to juice from listen to them and

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,899
so they can just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all out and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think most of time I feel like most</font>

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,480
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be</font>

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,600
done they just for one reason or another

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,629
don't want to admit it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves or</font>

19
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,649
whatever so have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been told also that I</font>

20
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,829
give good advice because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can be and</font>

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,870
this can be a good thing or a bad thing

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,330
relatively detached from situations

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,520
including within my own life so a lot of

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,530
times I have the ability to just kind of

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,990
break away from things emotionally and

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,820
look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the big picture</font>

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
logically of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what the next</font>

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,680
step is and apparently I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">people can do that but it's also kind of</font>

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,880
a bad thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> because at times I can just</font>

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,310
seemed unemotional about things that are

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,409
happening and it's not because I don't

33
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">care it's just because in my mind I know</font>

34
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,150
it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done so I'm just gonna do</font>

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,590
it and deal with it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um I've</font>

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">been told that about myself a lot and</font>

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,020
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like to get advice</font>

38
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">from me and I'll so that's also why some</font>

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,280
people don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get advice for me</font>

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,869
because they know that I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them</font>

41
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,409
what needs to be said and they don't

42
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to hear it that's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,990
reason why sometimes my friends will

44
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,579
have situations that happen and they

45
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,140
purposely won't ask me for advice

46
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,509
because they don't want me to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

47
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,038
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they already know is true so it's a</font>

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,540
double-edged sword do I like getting

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,620
advice

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,120
I do when it is solicited I do like I

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,099
often ask people what they think of

52
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,080
whatever I'm doing and listen that and a

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,730
lot of times I'll ask Chris<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

54
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,750
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what you'd be when you're</font>

55
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,420
married you kind of like ask your spouse

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,360
for advice a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh whether they've been</font>

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,220
in a similar situation or not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

58
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,019
ask them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah a lot of times I go</font>

59
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,000
to my parents for most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my advice</font>

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,819
whether its financial advice life advice

61
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,299
I mean advice on how to what to do with

62
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,599
my dog like I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my parents for a lot</font>

63
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,390
of guidance especially now that I feel

64
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I'm older and I can see how they</font>

65
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,660
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking back and really</font>

66
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,299
realizing that they did it right you

67
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,750
know um that they're good people to

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,340
their core you know so I asked them a

69
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,970
lot because they are kind of like the

70
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,120
prototype to me of what a marriage

71
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,329
should be what a family<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

72
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,579
and all of that kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I go to</font>

73
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">my parents a lot for that kind of advice</font>

74
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,160
life advice if you will them and my

75
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,889
sister my sister<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> older sister she's</font>

76
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,680
like basically a second mom to me /

77
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">confidant kind of thing so we confide a</font>

78
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,200
lot in each other and unlike me she has

79
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,629
the ability to be I think more emotional

80
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,030
about things and more compassionate

81
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,699
whereas with me since I'm so logical you

82
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,139
know strike one strike two strike three

83
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,359
and I'm done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you or she'll forgive</font>

84
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:54,180
and you know let you come back and keep

85
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,340
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that kind of thing where I'm</font>

86
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">just kind of like get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of my face</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

87
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,829
hate you now you know what I hate but

88
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,810
like you've wronged me so many times

89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,879
that I don't feel the need to have you

90
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,980
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my life whereas show you know she'll</font>

91
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,019
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time to understand your frame</font>

92
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know say I understand</font>

93
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,359
why you did it hurt me but I understand

94
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,310
where you're coming from whereas I'm

95
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,329
like you hurt me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I know I wouldn't</font>

96
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,920
do that to you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> go away</font>

97
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,300
so I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> often will go to her when I feel</font>

98
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,220
like I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more compassionate so</font>

99
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,930
we kind of balance each other out in

100
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,380
that respect I think um well yeah that's

101
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,720
really mostly it i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I like</font>

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,970
giving advice I like getting it from my

103
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,040
loved ones when people just try to like

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,990
just throw advice to me like they know

105
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,100
me and I'm like um back away but I did

106
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,250
not solicit your advice so that's one

107
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,600
thing I always try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure I do</font>

108
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,280
when people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of starting to tell</font>

109
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">me something relatively you know</font>

110
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,440
controversial in their life the first

111
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,610
thing I'll kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of say is well like do</font>

112
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,750
you want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

113
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,600
yeah that's the first thing I say I try

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,670
not to give unwarranted advice you know

115
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,310
like if they aren't purposely asking me

116
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,440
for it I don't give it to them so yeah

117
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,610
that is me on advice-giving um I don't

118
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what the topic is tomorrow do you</font>

119
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,490
look at calendar but I also need to get

120
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,440
back to work because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to get some</font>

121
00:05:27,440 --> 00:00:00,000
videos out the door to some clients so
