as you all know housing is an issue that I care a lot about and so when I came across this story regarding Kushner's company the Kushner family real estate company and what they did to drive out tenants in rent controlled buildings in New York and to jump on it and I have to tell you guys about the details of this story because it is alarming and this is something that is actually pretty widespread when it comes to rent control buildings throughout the country so let's dive right in now back in 2015 Kushner's family business purchased a number of buildings in New York in gentrified areas or quickly gentrifying areas so when the Kushner company or Kushner COEs bought three apartment buildings in the gentrifying neighborhood of Queens in 2015 most of the tenants were protected by special rules that prevent developers from pushing them out raising rents and turning a tidy profit but that's exactly what the company then run by Jared Kushner did and with remarkable speed two years later it sold all three buildings for 60 million nearly 50% more than it paid so what did they do to increase the rent of these units these units that were rent controlled well first let me quickly give you context and explain how rent control works when you're living in a rent-controlled building the landlord can only increase the rent by a tiny percentage each year so you can't be surprised with a $500 rent increase which you know non rent controlled buildings sometimes do have to deal with so one thing that landlords sometimes do is make the conditions so uncomfortable that people decide to leave and that's what appears to have happened in this case now a clue is emerged as to how President Donald Trump's son-in-law son-in-law sperm was able to move so fast the cushion echoes routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent regulated tenants in dozens of its buildings across the city when in fact it had hundreds so they falsified documents they said that they had none zero rent control tenants or units in these buildings for the three Queens buildings in the boroughs of Astoria neighbourhood of the Astoria neighborhood the Kushner coast checked a box on construction permit applications in 2015 that indicated the buildings had zero rent regulated tenants tax records filed a few months later show the company inherited as many as 90 for rent regulated units from the previous owner so when you're applying for units to do construction to renovate the the building they want to know whether or not you have rent control tenants or units in that building because they want to make sure that you're not trying to make the living conditions so disruptive and so uncomfortable that you're trying to drive people out they just straight out lied and so then the construction begins and it's uncomfortable okay so kosher would never deny any tenant their due process rights that's according to a statement by a representative obviously that statement is a lot rights okay so here's what really happened in all housing rights initiative this is an organization that looks out for people who are renting found the Kushner coast filed at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016 all of them indicating there were no rent regulated tenants instead tax documents show there were more than 300 rent regulated units okay also tax records show those rent regulated units that numbered as many as ninety four when Kushner took over fell to twenty five by 2016 so all of a sudden people are leaving right why are people leaving so they apply for these construction permits they get the permits which by the way again they lied and then they have workers contractors working on the buildings at all hours of the day all hours of the night so some of these tenants complained about how all of a sudden they see a huge number of rats in their building right where's the rats all of a sudden come from then they start talking about how there's drilling above them at all hours of the day all hours of the night it's so incredibly uncomfortable that people start leaving that is how they get rid of the rent controlled tenants and once someone leaves then you can set the price for the unit at whatever you want and that's how they were able to increase the rent and turn a tidy profit yeah yeah is it but is there any reason to believe that the Kushner family would engage in these sorts of activities on purpose I mean they're the white house respectable family Oh super respectable I believe this story 100% I mean there was an investigation into this and they found the evidence of how they lied in these documents to get those permits it could be like if I were Kushner how I would defend myself was I would point out all of the times he's had to amend his documents when he entered the White House where he'd forgotten about different businesses and things like that and just say that he has some sort of terrible memory problem and that's why you would forget 300 rent controlled units yeah as you say I mean this sort of thing like he his father you know as a former felon like he he engaged in these sorts of activities as well like he seems to have learned from it I think it's not a coincidence that he took up with Donald Trump another guy who's willing to engage in these sorts of behaviors or worse as you've said I don't think it's probably pretty rare across other companies as well but now he made the mistake of moving into the White House and casting more of a spotlight on his company's activities but has he has he made a mean they're investigating it now sure they're investigating it but I I mean we'll see we can find that for all of these I find it but that's the thing a fine isn't good enough I mean he's wealthy he'll pay the fine whatever he doesn't care I mean this is in my opinion you know criminal activity you are pushing people out of their homes because you want to increase rent you want to turn an even larger profit I mean this guy is already supposed to be tremendously wealthy and he potentially destroyed the lives of all these people they're living in New York it is not a cheap place to live to begin with where are they going to go once they're pushed out of their red controlled units so I want to read a few of the quotes by the tenants who experienced some of these incredibly disruptive living conditions Rudolph Romano said the following it was noisy there were complaints I got mice they cleaned the place out I watch the whole building leave another tenant said all of a sudden there was drilling drilling you heard the drilling in the middle of the night there were rats coming in from the abandoned building next door the hallways were always filled with lumber and sawdust and plaster having gone through renovation recently I know how incredibly annoying and difficult it is to live in those conditions obviously I made the decision to live like that to do the updates to our place but these are little Christian out drilling all night long but this was this was done intentionally to push these people out of their homes yeah yeah I still think I mean I doubt that they're gonna throw Kushner or you know the CEO in jail over this I still think large fines is the way that you you deal with this both to potentially to get some money that could then be given to the people who are driven out based on interviews about why they left and all that but again if this is a decision that's being made based on the idea that if we drive these people out we can make more money and they see that the Kushner company had to pay gigantic fines far more than they made by increased rents then hopefully it will stop other companies from doing the same thing but you need to make sure that you actually institute the fine so let's just quickly mention what the fines are because they are not gigantic in the context of Kushner's firm so according to New York law submitting false documents to the city's Department of Buildings for construction permits is a misdemeanor which can can carry fines of up to $25,000 they should raise that considerably I think it should be more than a misdemeanor well and I also I assume that it probably does but if it doesn't it should that if you do this a certain number of times it should either definitely trigger higher scrutiny for future applications for construction or renovation or possibly lose some sort of business license once you've done it half times absolutely if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm /join and once you do you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me TYT Network comm slash joy
