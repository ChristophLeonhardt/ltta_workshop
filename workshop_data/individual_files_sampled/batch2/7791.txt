take a look at the new results of an analysis by the Tax Policy Center of Trump's proposed tax plan now this is from about a month month and a half ago he had these bullet point lists of some his priorities for taxes now we've over the past year or two given you multiple breakdowns of what his tax plan is likely to look at alike at one point I went back through some of trumps old books and looked at his principles on what tax reform should look like and the numbers have always been stark these newer ones also extremely stark the tax cuts included in the Trump administration's outline for tax reform released in April could cut federal revenues by as much as seven point eight trillion dollars over ten years and the benefits would go almost exclusively to the top of five percent not the top ten percent forget the top ten percent business that's that's from like five six years ago now we're focusing on at least the top five percent just for context this is a smaller tax cut a three point four trillion dollar tax cut would amount to about twelve percent of GDP by 2027 slightly larger than all the tax cuts george w bush passed while in office that's less than half as big as the expected effect of these tax cuts and so bigger than all of the george w tax cuts so the reason they used a three point four trillion dollar number is if you believe the republicans can give them every benefit of the doubt yes and that they grant take away loopholes so some of those loopholes i think they will take away because that actually helps the middle class more and they don't really care about helping the middle class yeah some of them there's no way they're taking your way but if you gave them all the benefit of the doubt and said okay so we'll give you credit for those the the amount of the tax cut form goes from seven point eight trillion to only three point four trillion dollars which goes almost all to the rich yeah and so the best-case scenario is for the republicans who claim that they care about balanced budgets they're gonna put a three point four trillion dollar hole in the bunch and by the way that's not it's not just assuming that they'll do the loopholes it's also giving them the benefit of the doubt on their dynamic scoring where you believe all their propaganda about how much these tax cuts are gonna help the economy if you soon a bunch of economic growth that has not been proven and we've seen under george w bush how great did the economy do after these tax cuts well the economy fell apart just a few years later so i don't know why we would give him the dynamic scoring but they did to get to that three point four trillion dollars so i think it's much more likely to be near the eight trillion dollar mark if you support these tax cuts you're never ever allowed to talk about balanced budgets again because you don't believe it you don't come close to believing and all you want is taxes for the rich that's fine just own up to it yeah and now let's look at how they prioritize different classes in america the overall plan would give the average family earning under twenty five thousand dollars per year a forty dollar tax cut Wow or eight point three percent boost and after-tax income which look hey that's nice you can you take your spouse out go see wonder woman or something you with your forty dollars I mean you're not gonna get popcorn soda anyway that's what you can maybe see the movie in most parts of the country looks a little bit different for the richest Americans the top point one percent earning above three point four million dollars a year would get an average tax cut of nine hundred and thirty seven thousand seven hundred dollars or a thirteen point three percent boost in after-tax income there they're already earning over three million dollars a year and you're just gonna toss another million dollars of them yeah enjoy that while you're at the movies so just a little bit of context there the top point one percent starts at three point four million dollars yeah right so the reason why the tax cut is on average nearly a million bucks billion goes all the way up to the billionaires now for all the numbers a little bit right so having said that look a million now a tax cut for the richest people in the country is unreal and painful to think about on average of course someone like Sheldon Adelson is gonna get far more obviously yeah and and what even a tiny proportion of another tax cut give from the health care bill gives gives shit'll Sheldon Adelson I think like a forty million million dollars a year right this will give him way more than that so okay so but that's why the percentages matter so if the numbers were huge but they said hey look you know what for the poor it actually is a bigger percentage of their income that we're helping so yeah the rich are getting a lot too but what we're really trying to do is help before most importantly the middle class right but that is not the case for the poor in the middle class you get a tiny tiny percentage help not just raw numbers percentage-wise tiny minuscule but the rich get a huge percentage break when they need it the least thirteen point three percent of their income goes right back to them and and and it's a giant giveaway so I just want to give you two last couple of things here so if you look at the tax cuts that are proposed here sixty-one percent of the tax cuts goes to the top one percent sixty one percent so only 31 percent I'm sorry thirty nine percent have to be shared by ninety nine percent of us okay so when they say it's for all of us understand that's not true sixty-one percent goes straight to the to the very richest people in the country but even that is not that big a deal but when you look at the effects of the cut and the revenue raisers in the plan for the top five percent they get ninety four point eight percent of all of the benefits so the five percent richest people in the country get ninety five percent of the benefits of this tax cut and the other 95 percent of us get only five percent of the benefits so if you ever ever had a doubt about what the Republican Party stands for and who they stand for that is now resolved that you cannot argue that this is anything but a gigantic historic giveaway to the rich so don't if you're a Republican don't ever ever talk about wealth redistribution again because you love wealth redistribution you just want to redistribute it to the top and and lastly the corporate taxes are also going to be kind of in fact that is going to be the largest cut in the entirety of this plan is for corporate taxes because poor old corporations which happen to give billions of dollars in donations to the politicians who are passing these they just don't get enough of a break John in the golden era of the 1950s detected taxes on corporations weren't that bad that's why we were so successful that's why we're the number one here I mean we grew the way that we did and now they're so overburdened by taxes so let me show you the reality so here's the chart in 1952 corporations paid 32% of all taxes in America in 2015 they were down to less than 11% of taxes at they for Trump they reduce their tax burden by two-thirds and it is that money does not go away that is wealth redistribution it's a pie chart it goes to other parts where guess where it goes to it mainly went to the payroll tax for social issuance and retirement and the payroll tax is paid by the middle class they redistributed their tax burden from corporations to you and now they come back and go up it wasn't enough it wasn't enough now they're gonna cut corporate taxes from thirty five percent to fifteen percent so now you'll pay an even bigger burden of taxes and it's a win-win for them because then they turn around and go aren't you paying so much taxes and you go oh my god you're right I am so let's cut taxes but what they don't tell you is they're gonna cut taxes not for you but for the rich and for corporations yeah so it's a double win for them you get mad at the Democrats when in fact they just pulled off the biggest wealth redistribution of
