the Trump administration is planning on revoking a program that protects immigrant parents who had their children here in the United States now uh this of course is another attempt to undo anything that Obama did during his time as the president United States and what's interesting about this is Trump keeps going after uh policies that Obama attempted to implement but actually never even went into effect so let me give you the details on that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly revoked the memo creating the deferred action for parents of Americans program the program was created by President Barack Obama back in 2014 to protect people living in the US illegally who have children uh who are US citizens or legal residents they would have been kept safe from deportation and provided with renewable work permits uh so this did not go into effect because the program was blocked by a federal judge after twenty-six states sued and also this was a memo by Obama it was an executive order he didn't you know it was kind of non-binding so you know the lawsuit was interesting but nonetheless the federal judge did block it from ever going into action now Trump has also pledged to immediately cancel the program known as deferred action for childhood arrivals also known as daca uh he had originally said that he wouldn't touch that but who knows he keeps going back and forth but so far most immigrants protected by the effort have not been targeted by uh stepped up efforts to find and deport immigrants living in the country illegally yet they will be yeah this never this does not answer I just I mean a couple things Republican saw as a backdoor amnesty better that's because it that's what was paid because it was a thoughtful and and caring and and at a way to solve a problem and take some people out of the mix of a demand to deport like one when they had their kid here the kids six uh always leave that you know family are here their family and the kids citizen we can't do anything about that even though you'd like to one quick clarification um the program only protected individuals who are here in the United States but had a clean record no criminal activity whatsoever any without seconds about saying but some people you know immediately they hear undocumented immigrants and they think like these are criminals or any unsafe so I just want to make sure I clarify that their argument is that's you're a criminal because you hear that you are you're on your own but also just the 2016 I mean Billy this way you got into politics that's why you did it attorney general they're in there they're Secretary of State or ever Susan Kansas I'm gonna guess Kansas was one of them in Oklahoma in Texas because you want to send the parents of six-year-olds home when they're the person when that's when the six-year-old is a citizen and even though you'd like to revoke revoke the anchor baby part of the Constitution where it actually says anchor baby uh it's real pro-life minimize humans to anchors by the way that's right yes so you want to revoke that you're gonna sue really that's why you did this is always to me what I think about when cops that cop in in and and George I guess it was and Hardwick versus Georgia maybe had the name robbed the the the sodomy law that eventually went to the Supreme Court some kicked down the door because two gay guys grown-ups were having sex was there they wanted to in there grown-ups uh and I'm like and then and cited was incited them for sodomy and really this is what you get this is why you became conscious Oriole private sin so if they can go to prison right so they can go to where it would never have sent you to prison I will put an end to that it is you know it's staggering now the thing about this and another thing powers were heartless just remember add the racial component to this because they are only talking about Latin kids you know they're not going to be checked like I say those Canadians they've been sneaking in here having babies I got an eye on them nobody's Chan you know you know I mean nobody's going to actually what they're there is a trend of um Chinese foreigners rush on a tree and and there's there are businesses like these dark underground businesses that you know will bring Chinese women to these hotels they have the baby in the baby as an American citizen there's also that the case with Jared Kushner where his company that he did business with if you invested Chinese and you invest a half a million dollars you get a green card basically guaranteed you you get a green now they're not going to be checking any of those kids this is going to be Latin kids you know they they hate any sort of social program right they call that entitlement you know whether it be welfare food stamps or education or anything so what are you going to do here you want to send the parents home and it's just gonna be a kid like what-what are you gonna do you I don't I don't know and they don't know they haven't thought that through they haven't thought no I think thought it through I think they know that if they're forced to leave that what are their kids gonna do they're gonna go with that but this is another one where I say they just better hope Jesus doesn't come back imagine Jesus shows up and you've been orphanage children Jesus is like excuse me we need to talk yeah we're gonna have a little we have a little sit down you know it is it's horrible it's it's what I joke about it as a comedian but but behind the joke it's how can you just be so horrible as a person right who is a person just like you said Ben who's a person who says you know who we need to go after we need to go after parents of we need to get rid of like yeah what with everything going bust I'm a suit last up comes all the criminal old problems we have that's the group you need to go after that oh you had an American baby and you're not American a week you're right at the top of the list like a Raylan's that's why I got in you know just public service that's why I got into it yeah yeah yeah Young Turks membership creates independent media believe me no ads believe me all
