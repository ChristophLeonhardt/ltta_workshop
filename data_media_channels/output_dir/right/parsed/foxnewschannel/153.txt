ISSUE?
HAS TO PROVE HIS MANHOOD?
STEVE: LET'S TALK TO TOMI
LAHREN.
SHE IS OUT ON THE LEFT
COAST.
SHE IS ONE OF THE HOSTS FROM
THE UPCOMING FOX NATION.
TOMI, WHAT IS FORMER SPEAKER
PELOSI TALKING ABOUT WITH
THE IT'S A MANHOOD ISSUE?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I
WILL REMIND YOU THAT SPEAKER
PELOSI IS ALSO THE SAME
WOMAN THAT TOLD US THAT
SOMETIMES MOWING THE GRASS
NEAR THE BORDER IS A MORE
EFFECTIVE OPTION THAN A
BORDER WALL SO LET'S START
THERE.
BUT, FURTHERMORE, A BORDER
WALL IS NOT A MANHOOD ISSUE
IT'S AN AMERICAN ISSUE.
I WILL REMIND YOU MILLIONS
OF AMERICAN WOMEN WHO VOTED
FOR DONALD TRUMP TO BUILD
THAT WALL AND WE CERTAINLY
DON'T HAVE A MANHOOD ISSUE.
STEVE: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THIS CARAVAN COMING TOWARD
THE UNITED STATES?
I THINK IT'S CURRENTLY IN
HONDURAS AND THE PRESIDENT
YESTERDAY SAID HEY,
HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, HE WILL EL
SALVADOR.
IF YOU DON'T STOP YOUR
PEOPLE FROM COMING HERE WE
WILL CUT OFF THE CASH.
>> IS HE EXACTLY RIGHT AND
WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TO
SECURE OUR BORDER.
IF OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NOT
GOING TO COOPERATE TO HELP
SECURE OUR BORDER AND THEIR
OWN WE HAVE TO RESORT TO
THAT WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF
WE HAD A BIG FAT BORDER WALL
THERE SO WHEN THIS CARAVAN
CAME TO OUR BORDER WE
WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
THIS ISSUE?
BOY, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT
TO HAPPEN.
AINSLEY: TOMI, THERE WAS A
HEADLINE IN BUZZFEED AND
THIS IS WHAT IT READS.
SUBURBAN WOMEN ARE FED UP
WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
AND COULD DRIVE A BLUE WAVE.
ARE THEY UNDER ESTIMATING
THE POWER OF WOMEN LIKE YOU
THE REPUBLICAN BASE?
>> WELL, THEY ALSO TOLD US
THAT HILLARY HAD A 93%
CHANCE OF WINNING AND I
REMIND THEM THAT HILLARY IS
NOT YOUR PRESIDENT AND NOT
MY PRESIDENT EITHER.
THEY UNDERESTIMATE THE
WHISPER VOTER.
THE VOTERS WHO DON'T GO OUT
IN THE STREET AND MARCH WITH
PINK HATS AND VOTING SIGNS.
WE DO MARCH INTO THE VOTING
BOOTH.
LIKE THEY THOUGHT IN
NOVEMBER OF 2016 GOING TO
HAVE SURGE OF WOMEN VOTING
FOR HILLARY AND DEMOCRATS,
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE GOING TO
VOTE WITH OUR POCKETBOOK.
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR
NATIONAL SECURITY, BORDER
SECURITY.
AND WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR
OUR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
WHO ARE GOING TO SECURE
THAT.
BRIAN: HILLARY GOT THE
FEMALE VOTE, PRESIDENT TRUMP
GOT 53% OF THE WHITE FEMALE
VOTE.
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS WILL
BE ANOTHER CHANCE FOR BOTH
GENDERS TO WEIGH IN
HYPOTHETICALLY, WE ASSUME
THEY WILL.
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT
SAID ABOUT IT?
>> I HAD WORSE POLL NUMBERS
WHEN I WENT INTO THE LAST
ELECTION AND YOU SAW HOW
WELL DID I WITH WOMEN.
IF YOU LOOKED AT MY POLL
NUMBERS GOING INTO 2016, YOU
WOULD HAVE SAID THERE IS NOT
A WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY
THAT'S GOING TO VOTE FOR ME,
AND I DID PHENOMENAL WITH
WOMEN.
THEY WANT SECURITY AND THEY
WANT FINANCIAL SECURITY,
TOO.
BRIAN: TOMI, HE FEELS
OPTIMISTIC THE POLLS ARE
JUST WRONG.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN POLLS
SINCE THE LAST ELECTION
EITHER BECAUSE, AGAIN, A LOT
OF THE THINGS THAT WOMEN OR
MEN, FOR THAT MATTER, SAY TO
POLSTERS THAT THEY SAY WHEN
THEY ARE TAKING ANY TYPE OF
A SURVEY IS NOT WHAT THEY
ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IN
THEIR VOTE.
IN THIS COUNTRY TRUMP
SUPPORTERS AND REPUBLICAN
SUPPORTERS SHAMED INTO
SAYING WHO THEY ARE GOING TO
SUPPORT.
AGAIN WHEN THEY GOAT IN
VOTING BOOTH BY THEMSELVES
THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR
CONSCIOUS AND AMERICA FIRST
AND CANDIDATES WHO WILL MAKE
SURE THAT HAPPENS.
BRIAN: DO YOU THINK IT'S
PROBLEMATIC FOR MORE THAN
JUST STORMY DANIELS WHEN THE
PRESIDENT TWEETS OUT HORSE
FACE?
>> AGAIN, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE
THE PRESIDENT'S STYLE IF IS
HE EFFECTIVE ECONOMICALLY
AND BUILD US THAT BORDER
WALL I CAN REALLY CARE LESS
WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT STORMY
DANIELS.
STEVE: TOMI LAHREN JOINING
US FROM LOS ANGELES.
WIN OF THE UPCOMING HOSTS ON
