president Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met today in Hamburg Germany in it along with the g20 summit of course no media was present except for some photographers in the beginning so all we know is what Sergey Lavrov the Russian ambassador and Rex Tillerson have to tell us and so far they have said that Syria was discussed and that apparently Russia meddling in the 2016 election was discussed now also the meeting went on for two hours and 15 minutes when it was I think scheduled for a lot less apparently Melania Trump was came in and had to interrupt the meeting and she was quickly rushed away but according to what Tillerson told The Times about this meeting he says that that Donald Trump began by raising the concern of the American people of Russian interference in the 2016 election and that he pressed him more than once right okay so that's on one side on the other side mr. Lavrov right the Russian prime minister said that the campaign had already taken on a rather strange character because over the many months that these accusations have been made not a single fact has been presented according to Lavrov then he said the President Trump said that that he had heard the clear statements from President Putin about this being untrue that the Russian leadership did not interfere in the election and that he accepts these statements that he being Trump accepts these statements so on the one hand Tillerson on the one hand Lavrov back-to-back to what I thought was a great quote from Tillerson saying that that pretty much essentially at the end when it comes down to Russian meddling that quote it may be simply an intractable disagreement at this point so that's super important so let me give a little bit of context here so first off Lavrov the Foreign Minister in Russia also of course is going to do propaganda so I know some on the right and some on the left here in America say all the US government does propaganda first of all congratulations you just figured it out yes of course we do right but that doesn't mean that everybody else is full of roses and rainbows the relations also do propaganda so I wouldn't go and trust necessarily what Lavrov is saying about what Trump said which is all is forgiven don't worry about it I'm not holding you against that you know not holding that against you at all right which I wouldn't be surprised if Trump said it but that's Lavrov saying Trump said it's you take it with a giant grain of salt right but I think the most important part is Tillerson so first off I you know this is all being presented as super important because Trump is Tillison point out raised the issue of the Russian meddling in the beginning twice so what like like David Gergen in here today there you go again on CNN saying he seemed presidential today how many times are they gonna declare him president first of all he is president whether we like it or not second of all stop saying the most mundane things now have made him president right and they've made him modern-day presidential yes and so so it's not look I mean sometimes is he ate a bologna sandwich and so he looked presidential today eating that Bologna's gathered but most of the time it's more warlike things he bomb Syria now he's presidential he threatened the Russians so now he's president it's a minimal defense of American sovereignty and American democracy like hey remember that thing and you know remember the you know dozen officials that came out and saying that you actually hacked up the election and and you know voter roles are compromised remember that thing don't do that and you know I don't know cool cool cool yeah whoa never would I like backing off like that's not presidential at all well no Tillerson saying that it's sort of like an intractable disagreement and so I mean I guess we'll move on to other things that's the essence of it so when the Girgis of the world say on CNN quote this is presidential that's his second time saying in this was big-league stuff no it wasn't so when he says oh I raised the issue the meddling and then Tillison comes out and says well where is it and we confided as their so we're now going forward and we're done with it the reality of that news story is not that he raised the issue it's that they closed the issue they said okay we mentioned it once now but he did help us so we don't care we're done with it I said there's no sanctions there's no consequences there's nothing in fact what we did was the opposite we agreed to a ceasefire in Syria I'm happy with a ceasefire but it does cement Bashar Assad's you need at this point which is what Putin wanted so there was no consequences to the meddling stop giving Trump credit for that when in fact each you're playing into his hands this is exactly what do you want to do window dressing and no substance at all it's embarrassing can I say embarrassing I mean and you know I've never been more patriotic than I have been in the last six months I kind of tell you but I think something that would have been presidential is like and work you know creating even just a shell of accountability maybe like a you know some kind of investigation a joint investigation how about into you know potential meddling or how we can talk about cybersecurity you know just throw the American people a bone right there's no bones being thrown there is no attempt at covering this up it's just what I heard from Tillerson is you know play Adele's water under the bridge because that is exactly what this is going to be pretty soon yeah yeah and so one other thing that sort of came up during this meeting is a continuation of one of my biggest concerns from his trip to Europe so far I know that in the production meeting you mentioned in his speech in Poland there were these strong sort of authoritarian like nationalist statements he was making very scary stuff but also in the press conference there he repeatedly as he has been doing for months now attacked the press I know some people want to just lay down and let him do that and not worry about it but he's continuing to do it he's doing it with other right-wing leaders around the globe and in the meeting today Vladimir Putin clearly knows that because at one point he apparently leaned over and said something to the effect of are those the ones that insulted you talking about reporters that had to be translated to Trump but Trump sort of laughs hahaha this guy who also shuts down the Free Press thinks it's funny but what's more interesting about that interaction is this guy Jules who worked with seeker and I'm not sure if he still works at seeker that he said that the particular word that volodymyr Putin used for insulted there is the one you would use for a child whose feelings have been hurt and I thought well that's too good to be true but we had Mary our russian-speaking editor check and she said yes that is the form of insult you would use if you wanted to sort of condescend and speak down to a child like oh you've got a boo-boo that's what Vladimir Putin said to Donald Trump well to be fair he's just speaking his language so the Trump understands what he's saying but but to the interpreter point another really important point that is being not emphasized enough in this interaction so it's it's meant to be short as Francesca pointed out half an hour or so why is that being two hours of fifteen minutes there's only six people in the room so it's Trump and and Tillerson both huge allies of Russia in the past Trump has had tremendous amount of financial dealings his son say they got all the money for their golf course at Center from the Russians and so and obviously throughout has been saying very publicly although this whole thing's overblown there is no such thing as a Russia thing and center Rex Tillerson when he was the CEO of ExxonMobil had a half a trillion dollar deal with the Russians okay on their side they have just Putin and Lavrov their foreign minister and then the other two people on them are their interpreters who will soon wind up dead now okay if the if what happens the Russian ambassador's is through diplomats throughout the world is any indication I'm obviously kind of kidding about that okay so but my point is these are all people that if there was a deal with the Russians are in on the deal there was no one allowed in the room that was not in on the deal and we don't know that for certain of course and I don't know to what degree Tillerson knows you know what Trump had in the history with Russia when Trump's making deals for golf courses back in oh nine etc Towson's not involved in that so I of course this part of what I'm saying is to some degree speculation but we do know there was nobody in the room that if they had said something hey guys this is how we'll actually handle it that would have said whoa wait a minute what do you mean actually handle it like these are all guys who stamp again from lifting to Russian sanctions and they all were in the room and they come out and say oh boy we were tough on one another but I've decided that it's water under the bridge and we're done with it and we're moving forward support independent media come join us
