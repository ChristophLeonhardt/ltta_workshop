<font color="#E5E5E5">remind you of monsters incorporated</font>

25
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,979
where they have to hit the door and like

26
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,210
opens<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to a kid's bedroom or whatever</font>

27
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,820
I scare them it's like the door factory

28
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,649
