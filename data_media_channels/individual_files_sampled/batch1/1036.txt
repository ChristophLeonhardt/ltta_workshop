a nuclear pause North Korea's leader announces the suspension of all missile tests ahead of his story talks with South Korea and the u.s. what's brought about this dramatic shift and is Kim jong-un serious about peace this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm fully battable after a series of missile tests that kept the world on edge North Korea's leader Kim jong-un has announced his suspending all missile tests and shutting down a nuclear test site the surprise announcement comes ahead of two important summits with South Korea and the United States both countries have been pushing North Korea to denuclearize US President Donald Trump described this latest move as a positive step but is it a real change in Pyongyang's policy we'll get to our guests in just a moment but first Kathy Novak has this report from South Korea's capital Seoul North Korea regularly tested increasingly threatening ballistic missiles last year including weapons that could have the range to hit the United States in September it conducted its most powerful nuclear bomb test now North Korea says those tests are over totaled a Georgia Tech we will discontinue nuclear testing an intercontinental ballistic rocket test firing from April 21st the northern nuclear test ground of the DPRK will also be dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuance of nuclear testing it's welcome news for the US president who's planning to meet North Korea's leader Kim jong-un within weeks Donald Trump tweeted North Korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site this is very good news for North Korea and the world big progress look forward to our summit state media says Kim jong-un made the announcement as he chaired a meeting of the Workers Party Central Committee a gathering to rubber-stamp the Supreme Leader's decisions it was at a similar meeting five years ago that Kim unveiled his signature policy to prioritize the development of nuclear weapons and the economy the message from the leader now is that weapons program development is complete and the focus will shift to the economy currently under pressure from a us-led sanctions campaign would you call Kim Jong unclarified that now that the DPRK is position as a world level political ideological and military power has been successfully established is the strategic line of the Workers Party to concentrate all efforts of the whole party and country on the socialist economic construction Kim is apparently seeking to cement his position on the world stage following his meeting in Beijing last month with China's President Xi Jingping talks with CIA director Mike Pompeo in Pyongyang and ahead of a historic summit with South Korea's president moon jae-in on Friday South Korea welcomed the announcement calling North Korea's decision meaningful progress for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the president's office said it will contribute to creating a positive environment for the success of the upcoming inter-korean and u.s. North Korea summits China has also welcomed the announcement while japan's Prime Minister was more cautious hey North Korea's announcement is forward motion that I'd like to welcome but what's important is that this motion leads to complete verifiable and irreversible Andelman of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs North Korea's promise to stop weapons testing didn't go that far it pledged to never use nuclear weapons unless there are nuclear threats and nuclear provocations against it Kathy Novak al Jazeera Seoul well the pledge to stop missile testing comes after a busy year of launches by North Korea in 2017 there were 23 in total last September North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan it's flight distance was 3,700 kilometers which put the u.s. territory of Guam under threat a few days later speaking at the UN the u.s. president called kim jeong-hoon a rocket man on a suicide mission and he warned the US may have to totally destroy North Korea but then a breakthrough came on the diplomatic front in February athletes from North and South Korea march under a unified flag at the Winter Olympics and a month later South Korea announced Pyongyang was ready for talks with the US Donald Trump accepted the invitation within two days weeks later came made his first overseas visit to China following a meeting with North Korea's strongest ally they were more conciliatory gestures and Trump this week confirmed his administration has been in direct touch with Pyongyang a historic meeting is expected to take place in late May or early June well let's bring in our panel for today's inside story from Busan in South Korea Robert Kelley professor of political science and diplomacy at Pusan National University in Singapore Graham on web a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University and in Washington DC mark Fitzpatrick a 26 year veteran of the US State Department where he specialized in non-proliferation gentlemen thank you all for being with us on inside story Robert Kelley is this in your view a genuine set forward by North Korea or a negotiating tactic ahead of the summit with South Korea and the u.s. I think it's a step forward it's a smaller one though then I think maybe many people want to find it to be um broadly though I think the news reaction today globally and in South Korea has been properly restrained right cautious optimism um it's good the North Koreans are saying these things it's certainly better than we were four months or six months ago um the real issue of course will be verification right the North Koreans may say they're gonna shut these things down and close them down on the rest of it but at this point after 30 years of negotiating with North Korea nobody's gonna believe them until we can get international inspectors and their cameras and stuff like that and big question of the North Koreans always is will they allow that kind of stuff traditionally they've been quite hostile to it so um maybe this is sort of an early bid to cut help frame the the upcoming summits but you know it's positive if small step-grandma magma in Singapore you thought the big question of course now is why is North Korea acting in this way now not just on nuclear and missile tests but in other areas too agreeing to drop its objections for instance on us South Korean military exercises and so on why do you think this is happening now well it's very likely that Kim Jong moon doesn't want to see anything railing the prospects for meeting between himself and president Donald Trump in May or June and he's just setting the path for that for success essentially what are we been seeing over the last few weeks in my assessment just a series of carrots to make sure that things stay on track that as we know President Trump has the wherewithal to actually decline a meeting from now until it may happen and kim jeong-hoon is just taking chances on that and trying to ensure that that meeting does happen because it's it's a very important objective for him but there are those as you know who see this perhaps as something more sinister graham i mean that this could perhaps signal that North Korea has made enough progress with its nuclear weapons program that they've moved on to a next phase for instance very likely I concur with Professor Kelly's assessment he's made that the North Korea's nuclear weapons program is more mature than many of us think yes barring a final two tests at many technical experts say that North Korea ought to go through to completely verify the viability and robustness of its nuclear weapons capability North Korea under Kim Jong Un's charge over the last few years I've gone in leaps and bounds in achieving a good number of successful tests and have a relatively mature program and clearly what's happened over the last few days and not weeks indicate a sense of confidence in that that the nuclear deterrent is relatively credible enough for them to go around to cash in on that and to you know to reach out to major powers including the u.s. and South Korea and China and possibly Japan markets Patrick in Washington see present Donald Trump has welcomed that the North Korean announcement as a positive step but his incoming National Security Advisor John Bolton has made an entire career on the notion that you can't believe anything North Korea says so how can the Trump administration the u.s. justified today basically giving the benefit of the doubt to North Korea you know should they be satisfied with just a pledge you know I'm happy to see Donald Trump's instincts speaking positively about this development of course it's not verified it closing down the nuclear test site may just be because of the tired mountain syndrome they've conducted so many tests there that the mountain can't take any more and it could collapse so maybe there's not that much here to hang a hat on but it's one of what has been a series of positive steps by Kim jong-un and I think we have to have some humility that we don't really know exactly what he's thinking what he intends to do but applauding it and hoping for more is a good thing it may not be totally verifiable and as you said I think there may well be some tensions between Donald Trump and national security advisor john bolton who his entire career has been an entirely skeptical of diplomacy and distrustful of north korean so it'll be interesting to see that dynamic play out let me get Robert Kelley's views on that I saw you smile Robert when I mentioned John Bolton's name how is the Trump administration going to be speaking with one voice on this issue what is the strategy going to be going forward yeah well the term administration probably won't speak with one voice I mean this is I think it's pretty well established now after 15 months that the term administration is perpetually chaotic that's one of my big concerns actually about the Trump Kim summit is that we just don't know we're gonna get on the president's gonna go all kinds of conflicting advice he's gonna throw it all kinds of stuff on Twitter he's not really gonna read his briefing notes we know he doesn't read a great deal he might just walk in there and who knows what he's gonna say um my big concern in terms of sort of Bolton specifically in the Trump administration is that if this thing really goes badly if it turns into a food fight with Donald Trump and kim jonghwan exchanging insults the way they did last year on Twitter you know Batman Rocketman and orange man or whatever that Trump is gonna walk out of there and John Bolton's gonna say to him look I told you you can't trust these people I told you the only thing to do with them is hit them that's my real concern if this thing fails it could be a casus belli for Bolton Graham on the Trump Kim summit what does Kim Jang own gain in sitting alongside Donald Trump is it worth more than losing a nuclear test site well we capital e the point about the punggye-ri site it is run its full course and there's nothing to really lose in and shutting it down or dismantling it so Kim jong-un has really lost nothing there in offering it forward to everyone and saying that he's gonna put it down the meeting itself is gonna be of immense value to Kim Jong Hwan this is a man who is looking for legitimacy not just internally in eyes of his own people he's had to work very hard since he came to power upon his father's demise back in 2010 2011 to work hard to hold the reins over the country and he's done as execute a series of measures to achieve that he's moved his enemies and adversaries within his administration all the way he's put a very strong grip on his government machinery but he's had to had to win the confidence and hearts and minds of his people and in order to fulfill that he's got that requires him going on to the world stage leaving but how does he I'm curious to know Graham how does he justify this changing policy this shifting policy to his people as you say it's a very different policy from his father's how does he justify it how does he justify the changing anti-american rhetoric to his people look closely at the directory speeches even it's translated into the English language in terms of what he said since New Year's his newest speech and so on it has been very little change or any betrayal of office you know his established sense of mission and objectives for the country I think by and large we can take it that North Korea's nuclear deterrent is going to be irreversible I mean this is where the sticking point about utilization is going to come up there are clearly North Korea and the rest of the world or in the least the United States own different we're on different pages when it comes to what constitutes in the polarization and I think this is gonna be one of the big things to look out for during the summit how that's gonna be worked out but essentially coming back to North Korea and Kim Jong Un's messaging to his own people I don't think he's given up very much I don't think he's he's put himself in a position of contradiction in terms of you know swing hard one way last year with oodles of tests and then swinging hard the other way in first few months of this year in a sense of you know what seems to be what some people some people call equivalent of glass nose so I think he's playing a very a very careful and very well calculated game and I think he hasn't compromised at all in terms of what he's trying to achieve okay let me bring back mark in Washington DC mark you seem to think that this is a positive said if North Korea is living up to its side of the bargain if we see that they are indeed making positive steps in the coming weeks what then can we expect from the other side from the Trump administration they are going to have to make a gesture to North Korea somehow or nay what can we expect are we going to see a lifting of sanctions perhaps well I think the Trump administration has already made a huge gesture in just agreeing to sit down at the table with Kim jong-un and give him the status that the other guests have noted he craved so much but they will want something you know there is a belief by some in Washington including John Bolton that they're going to get something for nothing and absolutely have to give up something one thing that is in the works is no additional sanctions I think there's a pretty firm policy by the US government not to relaxed the current sanctions but not accelerating is something also the no more talk about attacking North Korea in terms of what North Korea wants this is a big plus they're no longer in the crosshairs and the threat of a US strike would have been very bad for both sides but disaster for North Korea so putting that off is a plus ultimately though the United States will have to do more and already the idea of peace treaty is on the table that's something that Donald Trump has indicated a positive attitude toward and maybe the biggest benefit for North Korea coming out of these series of summits both with South Korea and with United States so what are the next steps and what do we know about North Korea's nuclear arsenal its intercontinental ballistic missile V huangshan 15 flies at a higher altitude than farther than any of its previous missiles it was last tested in November and the US mainland was theoretically within range u.s. officials estimate North Korea has 16 nuclear weapons independent experts suggest Pyongyang has enough uranium to produce six new nuclear bombs a year in January 2016 Kim jong-un announced North Korea's first hydrogen bomb test but nuclear scientists have questioned that claim so Robert Kelley what happens next I mean if they are genuine and serious about peace North Korea are they going to open up you know these sites for verification are they going to be come are they going to be come clean about what they have you think yeah and that's the I mean that's gonna be the big fight right I mean if the North Koreans stop now that's a good thing right a Cape's them at where they are right so it freezes them in place um you know 10 15 20 years from now we'll all look back and say if they do this that that was a good thing right because nuclear weapons like everything else become obsolescent over time and need repair and things like that right so if they stop and they genuinely do that's a good thing going forward the real question is you say is what do we do with the extant program right and the missiles are you know they seem like they have a lot of them right dozens if not hundreds and warheads to it and right there the last one was somewhere on 250 to 300 kilotons which is pretty large they may have a fusion weapon too so ultimately if there's gonna be a deal if there's got to be some kind of denuclearization compact I mean the North Koreans have got to give on something otherwise a peace tree is impossible and you know sanctions are be huge pushback from Hawks both in Seoul and Washington if it looks like the North Korean is allowed to keep you know 50 weapons or something like that I mean that's really what the some it's gonna be about the North Koreans are gonna try and change the subject to things like even with cooperation sanctions and everything else but then the real acid test is will the North Koreans move on the program and right now we just don't know I mean there's been a lot of good atmospherics but not actually a lot of concrete detail from the four KCNA the North Koreans must be aware as Robert says Graham that they have to undergo some sort of verification process do you think they will be willing to give access and if they do give access who are they going to give it to will it be the IAEA or will it be the US yeah that's gonna be that's an important question and it remains to be seen I mean we've seen in the past how the North Koreans couldn't for long endure the scrutiny of inspectors when North Korea was under the NPT the nuclear proliferation treaty which have pulled out of eventually and so one can't really imagine that happening yet it's clearly a thing that North Koreans will have to accede to in order to establish a confidence and trust that is doing something tangible in Robert Kelley as mentioned obviously mentioned capping its current program and you know making good of efforts towards the tangible denuclearization but just imagine that's difficult I mean having foreign US inspectors or inspectors and at least coming in to scrutinize its facilities in full knowledge of the North Korean public I mean that's doing something that's maybe difficult to square off or kim jeong-hoon in terms of the kind of credibility and prestige and respect he's trying to build for his country on the world stage michael sorry mark fitzpatrick your thoughts about this whether they will give access to the US or to IAEA inspectors I mean where do you see this denuclearization process heading if it does happen I think they will give at least partial access they've done it in the past there was a time once when the North Koreans allowed a team of American inspectors to go check out an underground facility that the United States suspected was a nuclear plant and it turned out to be nothing so they've done that before and they can do that again they've had the IAEA in before and they absolutely have to allow the IAEA back into at least inspect the declared facilities that young beyond the the reactor that have been producing plutonium the uranium enrichment the reprocessing facilities those have all been declared and it shouldn't be problematic in terms of of public attitudes and so forth in North Korea to allow them in the problematic thing will be that the United States won't be satisfied with just going to a couple of sites they'll want to have greater verification throughout the the country and that's not something that North Korea will allow so in the past deals have often floundered on the degree of access for verification and that may well be the case here that at the beginning a summit will produce a very positive outcome but that'll all fall down in the ensuing months over verification what would be the positive outcome for this summit for the u.s. you talk about the summit we have no date yet for it does the US even have a strategy going into this summit well the u.s. definitely has a strategy they're taking this very very seriously and I think we can see that by the fact that CIA director Mike Pompeo went to uh Pyongyang and had discussions with Kim jong-un himself the United States definitely has a strategy they've been careful about stating it they don't want to raise expectations too high because you know the outcome is not going to be anything perfect it's going to be some degree of promise by North Korea some process for fulfilling that promise some early dismantlement by North Korea of the test site maybe of some of the facilities at Yongbyon and then a lot to be determined in the months and years ahead okay Robert do you agree with that do you think the US has a solid strategy going into this summit I mean we we still don't have a US ambassador to South Korea is there a team in place so do they know what they're getting into yeah I'm a little bit more skeptical on that primarily because of the president's own erratic personality I'm genuinely doubtful that President Trump can actually sit there for several hours and endure a lengthy complicated discussion about denuclearization now one would normally not expect that occurs there'd be a lot of staff work and diplomacy that had taken place before the summit I mean summits normally happened after months or years of effort this thing is flying along it's gonna happen in six or eight weeks or something like that again I mean maybe it's possible all these things are being hammered out lightning fast but it seems unlikely given how previous negotiations in North Korea during the agreed framework and the six-party talks plan all that tells me that a lot of things gonna be left unresolved when Trump walks in the room and who knows what he's gonna say I mean that's sort of the big question mark any other president I would say yeah we can see where this is gonna go they're gonna be a bunch of small beer discussions and and and agreements and stuff like that and then verification will be the big issue that's where it has been in the past but it might also turn out that the president just wanders off the reservation and says all kinds of erratic stuff I mean just watch him on YouTube it's grandmum Webb in Singapore your thoughts on this where is this headed the summit between Donald Trump and Kim jong-un of course but there is a the one coming up next week between the North and South Korean leaders do you think you know you were headed for better relations between North and South Korea well in a short to medium term I think we will president moon has been working very hard to make sure that that's happened in fact I think Kim Jeong RunAs read the ground extremely well and then at least in the least reading his South Korean counterpart screaming well sums up how he's you know basically skipped along and in extremely happy about the overtures from from Pyongyang and has reciprocated very quickly in fact quite desperately I would say and in most occasions and what do you think should be credited with the progress and the concessions that we've seen so far is it China is it is it South Korea the South Korean leader or is it the maximum pressure that the Trump administration has applied it's really hard to say I mean one could always sit on the fence I say all of these things and these theories are still flying about as to whether or not the maximum pressure effort of straight economic sanctions all around has actually tighten the noose and brought North Korea to its knees and now it's trying to negotiate but you know there's also a lot of countering evidence suggests that the listed in illicit trade exchanges between China and North Korea have been also propping up the North Korean regime so it's pretty hard to say about the maximum pressure argument I would say that right now my assessment is that Kim Jong Un's been driving the series of events right from the beginning of this year and he's been reading the the geopolitical ground extremely well he knows what his players have been reacting or gue had been going to react and he's he's the one who's calling the shots right now and I think he's the person who gains the most from the summit coming up in the new tune to legitimize North Korea as a normal state well it'll be interesting to see how things develop thank you very much gentlemen for an interesting discussion Robert Kelley Graham on Webb and mark
