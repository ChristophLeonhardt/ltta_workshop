in a good year farmers like Wayne Dunford wouldn't need to buy hay at all they'd grow crops and their sheep and cows would eat them straight out of the ground but drought has hit Australia's eastern states this hay has been trucked in from a thousand kilometres away with transport it costs about two hundred and fifty dollars a bale one hay bale will feed 60 cows for a day Dunford has three hundred and eighty so feeding them is costing him more than ten thousand dollars a week the ground of Adria gets too you know like you get a 50 count here wind blown in your face all day and there's a bit of dust mix through it and you still got to feed your stock and happen and what wind does but it gets everyone a bit cranky for some reason and you tend to get that but it's just the fact that you're out there every day and things are going backwards not forwards you know Dunford is mixing some hay with wheat grain and compacted wet grass silage to keep the cost down but making that mix is harder work even if it is slightly cheaper across eastern Australia the drought means that farmers are putting in a lot more effort and paying out a lot more money now the government can't help with but it can and is helping with the money Australia's national and state governments are subsidizing transport costs offering low interest loans and giving cash payments to farmers worth $9,000 only having assets of more than three point seven five million dollars to scola Faiz farming families from the handout it's the sort of help people in no other industry get this is a way of life that is important to Australia's future and as a result of that I think that means there's a special responsibility here but some economists think farms need to deal with drought as any business deals with risk in good years economically viable farms make lots of money which should carry them through the tough ones few Australians though see it that way most live in cities but they have a deep cultural affinity with rural communities it dates back to stories of colonial settlers taming a rugged land today the media adds to the emotional mix drought makes great television and in Australia visually ad droughts are really confronting so people in the city who don't necessarily understand the economics of Agriculture who have this deep cultural sympathy for farmers want their governments to act so it's good politics but not necessarily good economics addre Thomas al-jazeera near parks in eastern Australia
