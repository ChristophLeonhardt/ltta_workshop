last week California State University Los Angeles held a healing space to provide a safe forum for students and professors to unleash their feelings about my campus speech back in February sponsored by Young America's foundation that speech as you may recall was originally canceled by the university president William Covino after I decided to go to the campus anyway hundreds of screaming students blocked the doorways and they assaulted prospective speech goers and pulled the fire alarm professor to the egged on the protesters one even threatened student organizers I was forced to enter through a back door I exited surrounded by a full failings of armed and uniformed officers thanks to the near riotous conditions outside so naturally the professors and students who caused the commotion had some hurt feelings right there little get-together Covino announced he would quote never have anybody like ben shapiro to campus have you know fretted that very tragically and unfortunately somebody like me could show up on campus again meanwhile professor molina abdullah who is the chair of the university's useless pan-african Studies department said i had advocated quote anti blackness she called me a neo-nazi after realizing it was sort of awkward to label an Orthodox Jew a neo-nazi she then shifted her language slightly and she said that I was a neo KKK member she said students came to her feeling traumatized by a speech they definitely didn't hear and feeling brutalized physically emotionally and mentally by me I spent the bulk of my speech talking about how racial diversity was irrelevant diversity a viewpoint mattered this was enough to drive chaos and insanity at the school for months apparently quoting Martin Luther King which I did makes me a neo KKK member meanwhile David - who's the former KKK Grand Wizard has labeled me an enemy of the KKK I've been hit daily on Twitter by certain alright white supremacists Donald Trump supporters labeling me a kook which means a weak-kneed leftist who wants to watch his wife have sex with a black man prominent Breitbart news columnist and provocateur milo gianopolous tweeted a picture of a black child at me upon my announcement of the birth of my second child a boy the neo-nazi daily stormer routinely attacks me some of trumps alt-right fans tweeted that i along with my wife and two kids should be sent to the gas chambers those joyful pranksters as Milo likes to call them this is the toxicity of our crazy politics the campus left enthused by people like Bernie Sanders and sought by Hillary Clinton call anybody who disagree a neo KKK the KKK meanwhile calls anybody who won't support Donald Trump a cop this is what happens when basic American principles are no longer taught this is what happens when grievance politics replace the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States if you speak in favor of free speech it makes you a pariah for those who would control speech in order to build their own magical utopia so what happens to people like me who really hate the KKK and think the black lives matter movement is terrible what about those of us who think white nationalism is despicable and that the censorious brutality of the diversity clique is gross well I've got a bit of a long road we're gonna have to teach a new generation from scratch that freedom and liberties still matter regardless of race we'll have to attempt to restore the notion of a social fabric rather than the racial tribalism that now seems to dominate our conversation we'll have to stand against authoritarianism unfortunately from both sides I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show don't care about your feelings so first of all let me lead off by saying it's time for you to subscribe to daily wire if you haven't done it it's because you're a bad person I'm tired of waiting for you go to daily wire right now and subscribe and you can get this podcast for free well at least for 30 days and then you have to pay and we also take your kidney but for the first thing just like Trump University it's a great deal for the first 30 days so Jake sure that you put a daily whiner calm and and you can check out the video you can see my smiling face and you can also watch the videos and there will be videos today that you are definitely going to want to see so let's begin okay so the big news of yesterday is that Bill Kristol who's the editor of The Weekly Standard and an ardent never Trumper he has come out and he says that he now has the guy he thinks is gonna run a third-party candidacy against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and this person is David French Mark Halperin of Bloomberg he he's the one who announced this yesterday but wait everybody wants to know who's the independent candidate who bill cliffs crystal has been cowdung according to our sources we can now report that the man being hide by crystal is a conservative lawyer writer and Iraqi war veteran named David French you've probably not heard of him we hadn't either the big guessing game has been going on since crystal truth tweeted this weekend that he has a candidate in mind who he said would be a strong candidate John and I both talked to French and crystal late this afternoon both of them declined to comment but here's what we know French is a staff writer for the National Review he lives in Tennessee with his wife and three kids we reached him tonight he was traveling he says he declined to comment but with the two Republican sources to intimately familiar with what crystal has in mind says that while French has not made a final decision that is indeed who crystal was talking about in John he wrote about French in the current issue of The Weekly Standard kind of hiding him in plain sight okay so the fact is that the David French has has been let's give a little bit of information about about David French so first of all David French nobody knows who he is and you know I know who he is because I follow national review and I've read his stuff and I'm a big fan of his writing and have been for a very long time here's his basic biography graduated from Harvard Law School and then he became a constitutional lawyer for the foundation for individual rights in education so if you like how the campuses are going that's exactly what David French is trying to fight he's trying to stop the sense aureus left the the people who want to stop free speech on campus and and rip on religious people on campus he worked also for the American constant constitutional law and Justice Society so he's worked for a bunch of right-wing conservative constitutionalist organizations as a lawyer after 9/11 and after the beginning of the Iraq war he was sitting around and he was reading about how the Iraq war was going really badly and he realized that he felt like he wasn't doing his part so even though he had a couple of young kids he signed up for the Iraq war even sees a middle-aged guy in this particular picture and he signed up as a middle-aged guy to go fight in Iraq he did a tour in Iraq came back and now he is a lawyer in Tennessee so everybody is is asking the question who is this guy why why is this guy even here so first things first do I think it's a good idea for conservatives to run a third party and it I've said before I'm not sure that it's a good idea for conservatives to run a third party candidate for a few reasons first of all I think that it won't work and it's he's not gonna beat Hillary or Trump I don't think that it appears non desperate it appears desperate it looks like he's just like crystal was just searching for somebody and grabbed somebody and threw him out there it minimizes the level of actual disenchantment with Trump and Hillary because there gonna be a lot of people who don't vote for David French you don't like either Trump or Hillary Clinton and also there's something to be said for the idea that the Trumpster is sort of deserve what's coming to them in November that if you ardently support a Donald Trump and now you say it's the Trump train or be run over that what happens in November basically ought to be on you now with all of that said I think there are some good arguments in favor of David French by the way I would vote in a heartbeat for David French about both Hillary and Trump and it would not take any debt I I vote for David French in probably a primary David French is is a is a very very good thing or David French is a real constitutional thinker with a with a sterling personal record he's a obviously a veteran and and there are a lot of things to recommend David David French let me explain to you six reasons why I think it's good for the country the David French is going to be running apparently first of all I like the fact that he's a relative unknown so everybody to know he's not famous he's not famous good good really I think this is a good thing for America it's good for America for the for the critique of a Kansan it to be about his ideas and not about his persona we've had a year of Donald Trump and all of his various scandals and all of his various peccadilloes and all of it all of his various personality quirks analyzed on the front page of your daily paper we've had 20 years of Hillary Clinton's foibles on the front pages of papers they both have 100% name recognition and everybody thinks they both stink how about we get somebody who's just a normal person you know somebody who's not famous nobody who didn't make his money off the apprentice or off riding her husband's coattails to the White House I like the idea of somebody who just has principles but isn't famous running for the highest office in the land because I care about the principles I don't care about the level of fame and here's the thing nobody's gonna know what to talk about David French except for principles when he's on the air cuz they don't know anything about him so what are they gonna say about him they don't get to talk to him about whether he molested people they don't get to talk to him about whether he said he wanted to have sex with his daughter so they're actually gonna have to talk with him presumably about issues so I like that he's also honest I mean I've read David French and the nice thing about French is no one expects him to do any damage in this campaign so he can say whatever he wants he can say what he thinks all of the Trump people keep saying well Trump is honest he's honest he says what's on his mind no sometimes Trump says what's on his mind and sometimes he's lying to you and he changes his mind every so often so you don't really get the full honest Trump you didn't you never get the full honest Trump French you actually will you'll get the full honest French because he has nothing to lose he has nothing to lose the third reason the fact that he's an Iraq war vet is pretty is pretty cool here's what he wrote about being an Iraq war vet why he joined up the military as a middle-aged guy your America wasn't too soft to fight a long war I was too soft and I had no excuse think about that wounded officer did he love his wife less than I loved my wife did he love his kiss the kids at less than I love my kids yet he was risking everything and I was risking nothing so I enlisted I think him a Jag officer in the US Army and deployed to Iraq as part of the surge in 2007 attached to the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment I prayed throughout my deployment every night when I fell asleep every time a friend and brother fell every time I put on my gear we called it battle rattle to go outside the wire no assurance came no assurance ever came now granted Donald Trump that tough guy Donald Trump did survive his own personal Vietnam while attempting to avoid STDs during the go-go 80s this is what he actually called it because it was his own personal Vietnam quote I feel like a great and very brave soldier grant I mean that's that's real bravery and Trump did go to a military high school which is basically like serving in the military except not like serving in the military and he did dodge the draft of course and granted I mean Hillary Clinton did get four Americans killed in Benghazi and then blamed a video and tried to mandate when she was in the White House the military members not be able to wear the uniform in the White House and she did try to join the Marines as a woman specifically in order to try and call them out for sexism but I mean we can't all be we can't all be heroes I mean David French can bribe so those standards better still I think that that's that's kind of nice what he did fourth he's a constitutional scholar he actually knows something about the document so watching him argue with Trump or Hillary if they actually gave him the time of day which they probably won't watching him argue with them would be entertaining to say the least since he's actually read the Constitution which puts him one-up on Don Trump and actually believes in the Constitution which puts him one-up on Hillary Clinton fifth reason he's actually a family man so one of the attacks on David French that was brought up immediately immediately upon the the immediately upon this whole thing breaking was by Kevin Robert of Politico he tweeted this this section about about David friendships from a national review article before David left for Iraq he and Nancy put together rules Nancy's his wife in a painfully honest conversation about human frailty there'd be no drinking during the year of separation Nancy would not have phone conversations with men or meaningful email exchanges about politics or any other subject she wouldn't be on Facebook where the ghost of boyfriend's past could contact her when Nancy innocently started emailing about faith with the man associated with the radio show she was on she told David about it and he asked her to end the relationship David knew with his stomach clenching that the most intimate conversations a person has about are about life and faith and that spiritual and emotional intimacy frequently leads to physical intimacy so Robillard tweeted when David French was in Iraq he wouldn't let his wife email men or use Facebook that's not what that says but that says that he and his wife jointly agreed that there are certain restrictions they would place on themselves so they didn't put themselves in risky situations which by the way every married couple does to one extent or another and I assume that if you're gone for two years overseas those restrictions would have to be a little bit more heavy-handed than me going to the supermarket now granted I mean that granted the man has clearly he has marital issues he doesn't have a he doesn't have a joyful three marriages like Donald Trump with children from all of them and his wife raising them and he hasn't made jokes about having sex with his own daughter granted I mean he doesn't have a great family life like Donald Trump and granted he doesn't have a great family life like Hillary Clinton defending her husband against charges of rape by attacking the rapist and it's not like his not like David French has has you know great children it's not like he adopted a kid from Ethiopia what she did he adopted a kid from Ethiopia and here's what he wrote about adopting his daughter I think has three kids his third from Ethiopia says in 2010 we adopted Naomi our beautiful youngest daughter she's from Ethiopia for those who have not adopted it's difficult to fully communicate the immediate intensity of the connection I remember looking at her sleep in the crib the night we arrived back in America and feeling indescribably blessed the same feeling I had with her older biological kids just with more jetlag and she's one incredible joyful little girl we grow more thankful for and Iommi every day she's the light of our lives we pray every night for the strength and wisdom to be the parents God intends for us to be and this immediately was met with tweets from Donald Trump supporters calling his his daughter and this is direct quote a niglet which is the n-word but a but a small but it but for a child apparently and a picture of Donald Trump hitting the button on a gas chamber with the black girl inside it so this is these Granton I mean David French doesn't have delightful people like that supporting him but you know at least he seems like a decent guy finally final reason why David French would be good he's an alternative so there are a lot of people who were worried that those of us who don't support Trump will be blamed if he loses hey if Donald Trump loses because David French draws too much support that just demonstrates what a weakling Donald Trump is as a candidate five people in the United States know who David French is right I'm one of them but very few people know who David French is if David French starts to draw ten fifteen percent of the vote that's a testament to the fact that Donald Trump is insanely weak right you would figure that the Trump people who are super confidence about their man they would look at David French and they'd laugh they go David French I didn't heard of this guy like like that's gonna go anywhere like that's good but instead what I'm seeing is people very angry that did somebody named David French is right they know who he is but they're very angry that he would be running because Trump can only run unopposed and hope to win is sort of the idea in reality do I think that French's candidacy will go anywhere no I don't think that he's gonna win a ton of votes I don't think David's gonna win a lot about I can't predict anything because this this election cycle is not predictable I don't think he's gonna get a lot of votes but his campaign will be worthwhile and one of the reasons his campaign will be worthwhile is because of what I said in the intro here America has been lacking the capacity to even have basic conversations about constitutional freedoms and our candidates are not gonna have those conversations our candidates are not interested in those conversations Donald Trump wants to talk about how the presses means him and Hillary Clinton wants to talk about how Donald Trump is mean to everybody and that's the level of our political conversation David French is actually going to talk about values I would love to see a campaign based on that I would love to see a campaign based on that you know I think that that would be something that's worthwhile now all that said the media is addicted to its own gas fumes the media they're there as a friend mine likes to put a day there the kinds of folks who art in closed cars and enjoy the smell and the and the media are really they're very upset that David French anybody would would deign to to jump into a race that's so clearly gonna be won by these famous people but they made famous like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump how dare anybody try to jump into a race edge into a race but the media doesn't run so Mika Brzezinski who she along with Joe Scarborough big Donald Trump fans she is she's very upset about that she's Bill Kristol who recruited David French he needs to take a long vacation oh I never saw this coming literally I never saw this coming I think bill needs to take a vacation like a long walk okay and and that's not that there's anything wrong with this okay he handed over the weekend to the possibility of a third-party candidate to rival Donald Trump now remember it was the possibility of a third-party candidate to rival Donald Trump right right okay so that's got to be someone big big and aggressive and somehow has got that talent that can punch back and yet lead the country in the right direction well no political ally you rather have immediate record you now we know who this person might be Mark Halperin John Heilemann Bloomberg politics news yesterday that I love the guy he's a great guy he's been on our show but you know man okay so it's all dismissive he's not famous he's not famous okay so I got this argument also from my co-host in the morning I do morning radio here in LA and he and he was very upset about this and you can see that the media is very excuse me very upset about this it's just terrible how dare anyone how dare they I mean come on what does the country come to if this is where you draw the line as to what the country has come to if where you're dropping line is not the nomination by a major party of a felon if where your drug line is not the nomination by a major party of a know-nothing isolationist all right idiot if where you draw the line is a constitute attorney with a harvard law background in iraq war experience if that's where you drop online because you don't know who he is you're shallow you're shallow if that's where you draw the line it's because you're shallow because you want a celebrity politician you want somebody you know and you feel comfortable with you're too lazy to do the research yourself because the fact is conservatives who are not voting for David French let me let me ask you this why I vote for Trump is a vote for Hillary and you could be voting for David French I vote for Trump is a vote for Hillary Ryan you're preventing David French from being the president or somebody good like David French from being the president and by the way you vote for Trump and you're gonna get half Hillary no matter what the only question is whether you get the full Hillary or authoritarian Hillary so they say this idea that that a French running is the end of the world look again do I think French is gonna win no but I think it is what I like about it is is his entry into the race provides clarity on a few crucial questions do you value principled over party do you care about the Constitution or do you just care about quote unquote winning do you think that Donald Trump is the best conservative in the race and these are these are questions that I think people ought to answer and that's what I like about this is a crystallizing moment whether you vote for David French or you don't vote for David French and I again hear the argument you got a vote for Donald Trump is only he can beat Hillary Clinton David French has no shot at beating Hillary Clinton okay I guess that argument still holds but you have to acknowledge that you're rejecting principled in favor of a lesser of two evils that's because now you have a choice you don't have choice but you're not gonna take that choice because the reason that David French is not gonna be a viable candidate is because people think they have to vote for Donald Trump in order to stop Hillary Clinton they think Trump has a better shot of stopping Hillary then somebody who actually is a decent human being like David French well you know then there's the argument and then the entire media is on the side of this so Charles Krauthammer says it's a mistake to run a third party candidate I actually agree it may be a mistake generally to run a third party candidate but as long as there's going to be one I think that many ways French is is almost the ideal because he's not going to quote-unquote steal the election from Trump he's gonna be coming from nowhere he's not gonna jump in with a base of 15% support he's not somebody who's going to quote-unquote split the vote with Trump to allow Hillary in he's going to be building on the basis of conservatism and we'll see how far that building gets him here's Charles Krauthammer saying that a third party candidacy is not a good idea however sure until you put the name behind it you don't know where the numbers fall last word whatever name it is I think it's a mistake for conservatives to run another candidate with the explicit intent essentially a blocking Trump from winning either he's going to win he is the nominee of the GOP chosen by the people he's either gonna win or not and if he doesn't win it he should not be able to claim he was stabbed in the back that would be a terrible mistake in the future and that's the argument that I've heard and I think it's a good argument that that Trump is gonna start his whole stabs in the back myth and anybody who didn't back Trump is gonna be on the table okay if I back David French and he gets a hundred thousand votes and Donald Trump loses by 10 million votes that ain't on me that's on Trump okay because I voted for the guy Ralph Nader can only be a spoiler in Florida my Ralph Nader can only be a spoiler in a state that's so close that Ralph Nader is the margin of difference hey Ralph Nader isn't the spoiler in a Barack Obama vs. John McCain election and the same thing holds true here either David French and one of two things happens either he's wildly successful beyond his imagining in which case it underscores how weak Trump was or David French doesn't go anywhere in which case me voting for David French is not gonna make any difference in this election because he's not gonna have enough votes to actually make a difference he's not gonna be the margin of difference in this election but the part again that that's I that's amazing is that Chris Matthews you know he's out there smacking third party talk and he's very upset with the third party talk because obviously that would take control out of the hands of a media that have generated Hillary and Trump that's what we can't get past her folks the media created Donald Trump he's an apprentice guy for 20 years the media created Hillary Clinton she was a nothing she was the the first first lady to actually be considered as a political candidate she's a nothing of a nothing and the media created her and made her a hero here's chris matthews going after the third party talk number two i think in a win states i don't know if they can win states but that's really not at this point the objective okay the objective here is to get to 15% this is a step-by-step process for them should be governed by some way around the presidency good for the country to be but governed by somebody who loses a three-way race what happens Ralph Nader gets 92 thousand votes in Florida Al Gore loses blocks not what this is about I dropped anti Hillary Clinton but but you know even as the come first of all I don't think the country is ready for the Libertarian Party and if the country begins to sort of look at libertarians if they're going to try to reach out to the quote-unquote Obama coalition and go after women and african-americans people are going to start asking questions like for example and when when Johnson over the weekend said he would have voted for the civil rights era diaper taste the real joy of returns begin the table - exactly so one of them will be present the questions don't we want honest voting you vote for the person you want against the other person you start voting for third or fourth party Kennedy's you are not expert all shouting but at some point a third or fourth party candidacy has to begin to take hold this is the perfect cycle for that to happen if it's going to parties however the libertarian libertarians are not going to appeal primarily to disgruntled Democrats okay okay so so Chris Matthews you the media they're just flustered what do we do with this what do we do with this mean why'd you have to point out one thing that's ironic Mitch McConnell who so many of the the Trump people think it's just he's the establishment he's terrible Mitch McConnell as always as soon as Mitch McConnell swings behind Donald Trump Mitch McConnell becomes a working-class hero so here is Mitch McConnell going after Bill Kristol and all the Trump stirs were tweeting this today well I hope he's not successful because that will help elect Hillary Clinton to the presidency it's hard to run as an independent and be successful you could conceivably take votes away from a right of senator nominee and make it more likely that our liberal gets elected president so I hope like Bill Kristol he's a smart guy but I hope he's unsuccessful in this effort and the Trump people off suddenly love Mitch McConnell they found love for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and so it's and so the fact that they're all of a sudden getting behind Mitch McConnell demonstrates that this is at least for a segment of the Trump base a cultish support for Trump not a principled support for Trump but again I think one of the things that's been driving Trump is the media the media if you want to make sure that you get media attention attacked the press because they are self-obsessed they exist in a world of mirrors and cameras all they care about is themselves and that was nowhere was that more obvious then yesterday Donald Trump did a press conference yesterday we talked about it and what she called the press sleazy and he said they were terrible and the press kind of the they're like an abused woman the press they they they they hate it but I sort of love it you know the the girl who you really should get out of there because your husband is a terrible person please leave but she keeps going back because she feels like she deserves it it's not even that they don't think they deserve it they actually like the attention they they're so sick that they like the attention no matter what so they're obsessed with this stuff they love it they can't stop talking about Trump because if they're babbling with Trump then the stories about them I remember when Barack Obama started cracking down on the press he started cracking down on the AAP and he was wiretapping them and people like me were saying well where were you guys when they were doing this to other people and the answer was they didn't care when it was everybody else the press cares about the press they're very upset with Obama when he attacks the AP they're not as upset about President Obama when his IRS is attacking Friends of a right that's that's a different thing so the watch the press obsession with itself Chris Cuomo who again should not be anywhere near a television studio I mean Chris Cuomo who is the brother of Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York and the son of Mario Cuomo the former governor of New York Chris Cuomo is now an anchor at CNN he's talking to Katrina Pierson and look how self upset I mean this is just such a self-absorbed interview here we go Katrina when you don't like what I say do you call me an idiot no why not why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it but not for you to do it right now with me this is your chance you don't like the reporting you don't like how I put the questions you're not gonna call me something like that right why is it okay for him to do it well it depends if you're attacking me personally I might call you an idiot but you don't do that and we are talking about the issues a mr. Trump is being attacked personally on it has anybody ever saw mr. Trump mr. Trump you're an idiot aren't you nobody's ever asked him a question like that to invited to invite this kind of invective and again the media actually I do know absolutely at Chris there was a debate where he was actually asked if his kiss campaign was a clown if it was an ACME of course he's been attacked personally by the media and you see it in social media as well by reporters specifically and look it's not just mr. Trump that doesn't trust the media and leaves that they're dishonest I mean gallup tracking she that's absolutely true only thirty it's absolutely true I would argue that's why he does it I would argue that's why he does it because Donald Trump loves the media more than you ever have on your best day he loves the media he works the media he uses it he appreciates its value and it has served him well those tactics and it's both ways he's right he the media he loves the media and the media loves Trump they they love Donald Trump so you got Chris Cuomo there and this is why they love covering Trump because Trump will talk about the media to the media the media will talk about itself to Donald Trump by the way guys great dating strategy just ask the girl questions about herself everybody loves to talk about themselves right and this is nowhere more true than the media the media love the media of all the people in the United States the media love the media are number one on their list I mean it's it's it's Woody Allen's old line about self pleasure at least it's sex in someone he loves that so that's the media that's how the media treats itself so if you're talking about the media then the media loves it they're so happy with all of this and you can see that the media even when they're angry at Trump they still love that they get to talk about themselves as the righteous defenders of truth so CNN's Dana Bash she was blasting Trump yesterday because she says well Trump's attacking us for no reason were the great defenders of truth so that's Dana Bash is that with clip 11 instead what did he do he attacked the press as you said as sleazy as dishonest multiple times and you know not to get too too corny about it but it is the press number one it is our job to ask questions particularly of public figures especially somebody who wants to be the leader of the free world when they make a promise and they do it in a very public way like you did with this big rally for veterans to say it is our job to say where is the money where did it go how much did you raise it is a fundamental requirement and responsibility of a free press it's what makes us different than North Korea or other places and he hasn't had to answer questions like this in his prior life he's been a public figure for decades and he hasn't had to answer questions because he's been a public figure in the present but it's been bashing loves this Dana Bash is the same person who attacked who was it major carrot for going after President Obama too hard but here she's a crusader for truth here's what she loves then a bachelors in love with the idea that that she is the great crusader for true than the median lost this stuff I mean they love it Trump talks about the media it's just a giant echo chamber just a giant echo chamber then there are the people who are actually in love with Donald Trump so last night breaking news Sean Hannity's gonna vote for Donald Trump I know don't be surprised it'll be okay we'll get through it together sean hannity announced that he would vote for donald trump and and it got pretty romantic actually i am not the corrupt press I am I'm actually the conservative cheers mark it happens if you happen to be right about that yeah well I do I'm an opinion show and I I don't hold back that I'll be voting for Donald Trump in November all right okay that's I mean but that's that's just the text of what he's saying we also have the subtext of what he's saying and here's the subtext of what sean hannity is saying you really have to sort of subscribe to see this and enjoy it but their slow motion sean hannity endorsing Donald Trump I did see very funny tweet about this that somebody tweeted I wish my wife looked at me the way Sean Hannity looks at there's any luck Sean's been pushing Trump for a long time the only thing that's wrong with that in my view is number one though back Trump but number two this idea that you're just as obsequious to the other candidates as clearly not true but look at Hannity I love what he says there even in that clip Sean Hannity says I'm not the corrupt press I'm nice to you right so it's pretty spectacular he's not the crop press he's nice to Donald Trump I mean why I got the corrupt press anger Donald Trump we're not the corrupt press let's give you lots of media coverage should be nice to Hillary Clinton so you're all the corrupt press we get it you're all the crop press and there's nothing you like better than talking about you there's nothing you like better than time about you so you've got CNN and and this is this is again how Trump turns the entire media narrative on its head and it's amazing and it's that I've been saying for literally my entire political career the media is terrible they lie about conservatives they're unfair to conservatives totally true Trump comes in and he says the media is lying they're terrible and they treat me unfairly but he says it about things where they're actually not treating him unfairly where they're actually saying things that are true as you mentioned yesterday it is perfectly in in bounds to say you pledged to give a million dollars to the vets it's five months later where's the cash that is totally in bounds there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever right so but so the left press attacks him he calls them corrupt and then what happened members of the right press come to his defense because they're so used to being reactive to the left press that they just come to his defense so Sean Hannity he comes out and he says what did the press think that you were gonna steal the money or something is that mean why were they even asking these questions I watched this and I'm thinking what do they think you need the money do they think you're going to steal it you were going through a process though of vetting these groups which by the way is a responsible thing to do right but I just feed them the entire defense Sean I mean like word for word you want actually just put your hand up the back of his jacket and control his mouth behind what who didn't do the things that these charities had to be vetted that would be responsible that yes I think they would be there correct I mean but it wasn't just Sean Hannity Bill O'Reilly did the same thing last night he says that you know it's just it's terrible that anybody would accuse Donald Trump of holding back guys he said he gave them the money five months ago the day the Washington Post report came out the day it's just a big coincidence that's when the vetting of the charities ended big coincidence five months nothing report comes out that day he signs a bunch of checks to charities here's here's bill o'reilly doing doing the same routine the lead is thank you for giving money to the vets but he created his own controversy but why would you say that when there was no data colonel that said he didn't give the money it was basically a supposition fabricated by anti-trump well in the press I mean there was no data that came out and said Trump is stiffing the vets there was no accounting that said that so why would you be so hard on Trump okay we can stop it there but there's no accounting okay you can't prove a negative you can't prove a negative if I say if I say Lindsey you need to stop beating small children in your apartment right and Lindsey says well I don't do that so we'll prove it prove it there's no way to prove it right there's no way to prove she doesn't beat small children in her apartment there's no way to prove it because she wasn't a camera in her apartment 24 hours a day or if she does she shouldn't show that tape to anyone because it's weird but but the fact is that this is the same way that so that's what a rally signai saying well there was no proof that he didn't give the money yeah there was none of the veterans groups said they'd received the money that's the best proof that you can offer but again I'm not gonna say that that Hannity and O'Reilly are just in the tank totally for Trump although I think that there's some truth to that there's also I mean listen Bill O'Reilly they I don't want to have milkshakes with Trump and Sean Hannity is is I mean gazing lovingly into Trump's eyes during these interviews but there's something else too and that is they're just reacting to a media that has been habitually and and consistently in favor of Hillary Clinton and the left so for example look Hillary Clinton she came out and she talked about Trump not making these contributions and then finally making the contributions here's what Hillary had to say about that whole scandal is clip six what is your action - what happened it's from tower today well I think the problem here is the difference between what Donald Trump says and what Donald Trump Trump does you know he's bred for months about raising six million dollars for veterans and donating a million dollars himself but it took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution and getting money to veterans group I of course over the course of my life I've not only donated personally but I have worked to provide hundreds of you know millions of dollars over time to help our veterans by what I voted for what I've worked for actually John McCain and I helped raise funds for the intrepid fallen heroes fund to build a rehab facility at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio so that our returning she's terrible in every way she's talking about how she raised lots of money for the troops yeah sure yeah I mean you used my money for the troops there's a difference all right that's me giving money to the troops that's not you giving money to the troops when you tax me and give money to the troops that's actually my money not your money and you ran a hundred billion dollar scam foundation I mean the the Clinton Foundation so yeah no I don't buy that in any way shape or form so people react to that and they say okay well if Hillary says it then it must be then it must be false therefore Trump must be justified in all of this the the lengths to which people are willing to go to defend Trump this is why I think the French run is interesting because it's it's it's casting a light on the lengths to which people will go to defend Donald Trump so last night I was on with megyn kelly and she had me talking about Donald Trump of course because that's all anybody can talk about and I was on with with Robert wool who's or David Wallace is his name I think and David walls a lawyer was a very Pro Trump lawyer and she had me talking about the fact that Donald Trump during one of his rallies came out and attacked a judge in his Trump University case so for people who haven't been following this Trump University is a scam University Trump setup it's basically a timeshare company and what he would do is he would get people into the room you would upsell them and tell them these really expensive courses on how to make money in real estate only one problem nobody really ever learned money on real estate that you spent tons and tons of money to get Trump's imprimatur Trump would tell them things like I'm gonna come and you're gonna take pictures with me and then they would actually end up just taking pictures with cardboard cutouts of Trump they revealed in court filings court papers the the kind of playbook for people to get people enrolled in Trump University it's not like Prager University which is also not accredited but is a donation driven system that has an educational product there is no real educational product apparently at least that's the allegation in any case Trump was talking about the judge the judge releases a bunch of documents the judge happens to be a guy who whose parents are Mexican he was born in Indiana his parents are Mexican naturally this means that Donald Trump has to attack the judge for being Mexican right doesn't attack him for saying you're an Obama appointee or attack him on the grounds that he would he has associations with group that Trump doesn't like instead he goes directly to this guy's a Mexican that's why he doesn't like me so that would be in any real-world pretty unacceptable right just saying that you're Mexican therefore you must not like me you're Mexican therefore you must believe X okay Mexican it turns out is not an ideology or philosophy it's an ethnicity but it doesn't matter to term so watch you know I'm beautiful and handsome here but watch David wool who's the lawyer because his defense of Trump this is how far Trump advocates are willing to go in defense of a man and if you say that this doesn't tear the beating heart out of decency and conservatism I don't know what does for Trump there's some sort of bizarre connection between the ethnicity of the person and the idea the ideology the person must hold I don't know why him being a Mexican would even be relevant to the conversation especially when he's not from Mexico and his parents are Mexican why would it be yeah I don't think it is I think it's a non sequitur making trouble mentions many many ver women rips on this judge yep I think he's and his ethnicity is Hispanic he's from Indiana non sequitur making the issue of him going after the judge though I got to say you know this is how is this any different than Barack Obama in 2010 at the State of the Union when he ripped he excoriated Supreme Court justices were sitting horribly appropriate and the Citizens United case may be many of them he bullied them right in front of him and you know what make it after you justify this behavior by blocking another bad behavior well Megan I'm just saying and you know what Bill Burton by the way who is Obama's press secretary at the time you gotta listen to this he said I'm quoting one of the great things about our democracy is that powerful members of government of high levels can disagree in public and in private and this is one of those instances Wow this is all it is Megan he's got the First Amendment right common does have issues as Ben pointed out really frustrating him because I've reviewed this case it should've been dismissed a long time ago on a summary judgment motion no question about know I mean Ben is not a lawyer David and I are lawyers that completely disagree with you on that and the court of appeals and the Court of Appeals the Court of Appeals actually upheld this it wasn't all this judge listen you can say that there's no merits to the case and Trump will get his day in court but to go after the judge as they quote Mexican and hater takes it to a different level Ben well absolutely and the fact that Trump defenders have to rely on Barack Obama was a bad guy therefore if I got our guy does the exact same thing it's it's just EE as awesome it's definitely a Trump campaign I mean why why is it okay so why so you tell me David why is it better the Trump did it now the Barack Obama said I thought we were running against Barack Obama if we're on the right I thought the idea was Obama's point is the point is you know what he said immediately after they said love the Mexican people I've got this opportunity to express my love for the Mexicans sometimes you have a slip of the tongue and I submit to you nobody listen listen nobody give Trump a hard time if he said I don't like this judge I don't think it's been fair to me I'm gonna get my days I'm gonna win this case great go for it that's good that's right no it isn't that what we're debating here is is taking it a step further personalizing it going after the guys ethnicity and he does it every time you know you know something make it he did he is remember he may be misconstrued that membership in la raza Lawyers Association I don't know there are a lot of people that have gone after him because of his border policy I don't know whether he felt this judge should he should recuse himself because of those issues it creates a bias where none exists and then demands it the person is right after dumbbells with this judge after mr. Trump right after mr. Trump complained last week about the judge the judge releases the documents immediately right up there after I submit to you does that create an appearance of impropriety may well do so and if he doesn't recuse himself it may be up to mr. Trump's lawyers to file the motion for recusal with a different choice I've done that you don't know so basically you insult the judge and then when the judge does something that he's perfectly allowed to do under the law and there's a motion before the court murder released these documents then you say he has to recuse himself to create the oh you don't find the only way to resolve our issue nobody so you create the issue and then the only solution is for Trump to get what he wants it by the way oh this is a whole slip of the tongue nonsense when your tongue keeps slipping in the same direction at a certain point you sort of have to figure that there's a little bit of intentionality to it the guy's tongue is a slip and slide he doesn't just slip every so often okay you know the the reason I played the whole segment here beyond the fact that it's wildly entertaining is is if you look at Trump's lawyer he's spinning every which way and this is what Trump's defenders have to do and the media is happy to cover it because with every spin with every spin the media either gets to portray itself as the beautiful victors or as stumped by Trump which means that they're still being sucked by the by this wonderful man by the by this egregious man so media gets to play itself is great in opposition of Trump Trump's their foil or Trump is just a master manipulator of the media and so we're still worshipping at our own altar right because we're the ones who still make the make the power decisions it's all about the media for Trump and that's why it would be wonderful would be wonderful if conservatives would actually stand up for principle and stop backing this this nonsense because you're gonna you're gonna go down with the ship you want this ship you're gonna go down with this ship you you want to defend Donald Trump calling judges Mexican because he opposes it's all yours baby I mean this is that you broke it you bought it you you said you want to break the Republican Party well you did so and now there's an alternative for you you may not like you may think he's obscure he may not be his fancy he may not have the same number of wives he may not have the Solomon esque kingdom of horses but he but he's somebody who actually believes in principles you supposedly do so I'd like to see you defend why exactly Trump is your man instead of somebody like David French okay time for a couple of things I like and then a thing I hate so couple of things that I like there's this great show it's I think it's the best show on TV there are two shows I'm in the middle of right now now I'll talk about one of them tomorrow I'll mention its man in the high castle but I'll talk about that one tomorrow the other one that I'm really into and the last episode was last night his turn turn on AMC great great show the show is about Washington spy ring how he was gathering information on the British and and it really is a fascinating well written period sensitive piece it's it's it's really good all the characters are really well drawn Washington plays a major on is it pretty cool character it's it's a terrific show here's what the preview look like for the first season well he's almost a year old Oh faster he learns to walk centering moves to march it's a good point Lord ah you need someone to protect you captain thank you sorry we're celebrating your king's victory in we are the beacon of authority and we bear the burden of that authority I saw Ben Tallmadge trying to recruit me for a secret mission against the British I won't do it why not hi Baberaham what ho what more do they need to take from us do sincerely and faithfully promise and swear Washington's been trying to get a man inside the city since out to be Oliver but I will bear true allegiance to His Majesty King George the third you're doing I can't afford to lose you that was impressive I know you lied the whole show is really terrific it's getting better and better actually it started off solid show now third season is really really good it's got Benedict Arnold in his whole story in the back story it's got the story of John Andre who is the sort of charming spy master for the British it's a really good show so you should check it out it's not kid appropriate but a teenager appropriate and and it's really really good okay other things that I like to snoop dump it's being there's a show on TV they're doing a remake of roots and this remake of roots is apparently a even less flattering portrayal of white people in America than the then then the original version of roots so the original version of roots by Alex Haley it turns out a lot of it was fabricated which is not to say slavery wasn't horrific of course it was but that but roots factually speaking was fabricated it was a very big scandal at the time the new version of roots says there are no good white people right all the white people are bad basically that's what all the reviewers say snoop dogg has now done a video in which he talks about why he's not watching roots he has one comment here that I'll quibble with and then the rest of it is actually pretty spot-on so I mean I can only assume he was high when he did this cuz he's high like 98% of the time and the other 2% of the time he's either sleeping around the toilet so since he was filming a video I'm gonna assume he was high but he hears Snoop Dogg explaining why he's not watching roots no disrespect but I can't watch no mother mo black movies would get dogged out 12 years of slave roots underground I can't watch the none today sick of it not if they're gonna put roots on Memorial Day they're gonna just keep beating that's in our heads or how they did that huh I mean I don't understand America I just wanted to keep showing the abuse that we took hundreds and hundreds of years ago but guess what we're taking the same abuse think about that point when y'all gonna make about the series about the success that black folks is having the only success we have is roots and 12 years of slave like that huh y'all and watching that and I advise you mother that's brilliant like myself dim television shows let's create our own based on the day how we live and how we inspire people today black is was real ghetto right Jews and then he cuts to shot of his dog so obviously the one cripple I have is is when he says that that we have the same stuff going on today that was happening in the days of slavery this is factually incorrect as noted by the fact that Snoop Dogg is a convicted criminal who's worth a bajillion dollars mainly because he raps and smelt enormous quantities of ganja so the idea that that the Snoop Dogg is living just as his ancestors lived during the times of slavery yeah not so much but when he says that it would be good to actually provide a vision for young black people in America of what black success looks like that's exactly right well you don't need is more victim and victimization TV and listen I think we should all know our history I saw it 12 years a slave I think it's an important film I saw the original route I rented that I think that it was important for what it did at the time I think that it's significantly more important for black people in the United States and Jewish people every person in the United States to see the possibilities of the American Dream what you can do if you put your nose to the grindstone than it is to talk about all the terrible things that have happened to people who look like you 150 years ago okay thing I hate okay so Marco Rubio has now endorsed Donald Trump this is not a huge surprise it was kind of predictable but and and that's not something I like but I can't say it's something that I truly hate that it's the worst thing in the world some people feel really betrayed by Marco Rubio I think that Marco Rubio like most Republican politicians feels the necessity to rally around the candidate because he feels like he wants a future in Republican establishment politics and party politics is all about the in party politics is all about the the establishment so that's one thing but Marco Rubio Marco Rubio now says that he wants to apologize to Donald Trump this is the part that I hate we go and I actually told Donald one of the debates I forget which one I apologize to him for that I said you know I'm sorry that I said that it's not who I am and I shouldn't have done it and I didn't say it in front of the cameras I didn't want any political benefit I'm not a candidate now so I can say that to you because not because of him but because of me you know I didn't like what it reflected on me it embarrassed my family it's not who I am and you did it almost in a sense of you know nothing at this point you know nothing is working I mean this guy is out there every day making mocking people saying horrible things about people but if you respond to him somehow you you know you're been you banette you're hitting below the belt and and that was my sense of it at the time what I didn't realize was you know it it isn't Who I am and if you're not being who you are it doesn't come across well and and he could do that because for whatever reason he can do that but but I couldn't do that it's not who I am it's not what I do and by doing it I ended up hurting myself not him oh my god okay so this whole you gotta pay homage to mr. Trump you gotta go before unbending knee and apologize for using exactly the same tactics on Trump that he's been using on you this is sad sack kind of stuff and the fact is that it's revisionist history to suggest that that Marco Rubio lost because he was harsh with Trump no the reason he lost is because he lost he was already trailing in the polls in Florida by the time he decided to go after Trump it was too late Trump had already been defined in the public mind there was not much that he could do there but it's just it's it's sad that this campaign has basically come down to a bunch of people now going on bended knee before Donald Trump there's nothing wrong with going after Donald Trump in the manner that he attacks you I'm not a civility guy and I don't think that civility is necessary when you're talking about a Vulgarian like Donald Trump I think it makes you look like a fool okay final thing that I hate so UCLA there's apparently a shooting today at UCLA my alma mater where my wife is graduating med school in the week and and it's a really apparently what they're reporting now is the latest news so it may change but they're currently reporting is that it was a murder-suicide at UCLA they at the campus on lockdown this prompted Debra Messing who has not been relevant since Will and Grace to come out and tweet this so she tweeted a picture of herself and she wrote horrendous watching news about shooting at UCLA with casualties while taking selfie to bring awareness to gun violence and then it's a picture of her wearing the t-shirt that is the that is the t-shirt for Katie Couric's new documentary okay there are a couple of things about this that are just asinine to number one Katie Couric's documentary has been discredited to the point where epics actually pulled it that's the the network that was gonna run it they pulled it because as we discussed yesterday Katie Couric inserted a pause in the film to make it look like the the gun advocates she was talking to her stupid and didn't know answers to her questions so that's number one number two isn't a typical celebrity garbage - there's a shooting going on and so they say I'm posting a selfie like this is the way you solve the world's problems well I guess I if she I wish that she had a black shirt that said hashtag no death and then we could end death in the world that probably the best way to do all this we could really just or maybe even better we could do hashtag world peace could be pink and then we could really just finish this whole thing off once and for all world peace no death boom all your problems solved and but this is how celebrities treat the world what I say is so deeply important what I say is more important than what I do I can hey I assume she's a nice person but it wouldn't matter even if she weren't there plenty of not nice people like Sean Penn II did the same kind of stuff what I do as a human doesn't matter what I say as a human matters and so if I selfie myself wearing a t-shirt about gun violence you know how many less people will die and gun violence because she took the selfie the answer is zero the answer is zero but it's all moral posturing that's all this is it's just moral posturing the real morality would have been if somebody UCLA had a gun to stop this person presumably UCLA does in fact have a gun-free zone policy so if you are a if you are a person who wants to carry a gun at UCLA that is verboten you're not allowed to do that California is already the most heavily gun regulated state in America they got an A from the Brady Campaign and right now there are a bunch of bills on Jerry Brown's desk including a bill to ban so-called assault rifles that have a capacity for switching the magazine so they I guess want to go back to either bolt-action or back to you're stuck with one magazine and you can't eject the magazine and change magazines which means you have to unscrew the magazine between each time you use it which is just absurd every time I go shooting I'm supposed to unscrew the magazine when I practice with my rifle and it makes perfect sense to me so again moral posturing from the left this is what they do okay so end of story politics is not about moral posturing but it is about the idea that you should have some principles in your life that you centralize you maybe your principle is just stop Hillary Clinton if so I got you all right I understand why you're voting for Trump maybe your principles are beyond that maybe you actually want somebody that you can vote for whatever your principles are make them clear and don't make them subject to the whims of any one political figure because at the moment you do that you're no longer a principled person you're just a follower of a god-king orange or otherwise i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
