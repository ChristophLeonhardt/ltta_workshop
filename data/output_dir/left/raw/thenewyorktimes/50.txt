1
00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:03,700
This African grey parrot is
about to make

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,090
a successful trade.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,740
Instead of immediately
eating a sunflower,

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,600
it takes a plastic
ring that it

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,660
can trade for a walnut,
which parrots like better.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,760
This green macaw faces
a different decision:

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,260
a walnut now, or the ring
to trade for a walnut later?

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,860
Well, walnut now, obviously.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,690
All of this is
part of a new study

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,800
of parrot decision-making.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,690
Here’s the question:

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,340
Would the birds
be able to judge

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,070
the value of a treat
versus a token,

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,950
and wait for the better
option if necessary?

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,540
Here’s how the
experiment — involving

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,670
four different kinds
of parrots — work:

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,100
Birds first learn that
each token could be traded

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,110
for a specific kind of food.

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,590
A metal loop for dry corn —
the least appealing.

20
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,170
A metal bracket for a
sunflower seed — a bit better.

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,850
And a plastic ring
for a walnut —

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,570
which they liked best.

23
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,960
Then they were offered
complicated choices,

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,340
like dry corn now versus
the ring to trade later.

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,380
They were able to see
that it made more sense

26
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,540
to take the ring
and wait to trade it

27
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,950
for a piece of walnut.

28
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,490
They also reliably
rejected low-value corn

29
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,820
for a medium-value
bracket, which gave

30
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,020
them a sunflower seed.

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,160
They weren’t perfect.

32
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,570
This African grey,
for example,

33
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,860
seems to have a real taste
for immediate gratification.

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,350
Overall, out of the
four species tested,

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,840
the green macaws were
consistently the best

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
at making the right trades.

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,070
But even for them,
birds like Shouty here,

38
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,185
were occasionally of
two minds about their trades.

39
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,710
Should I?

40
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,100
Shouldn’t I?

41
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,680
Don’t worry, Shouty.

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:00:00,000
We all have trouble
making decisions.
