<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so without further ado I'm going to</font>

24
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,370

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,949
impact her opportunities in the future

28
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,610
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-key terrified of Trump</font>

29
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,140
actually makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me really sad that I got</font>

30
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,120
a question like that I would never<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,390
em with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> women how to respond to</font>

32
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">this increasing climate as a song for</font>

33
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,420
you because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different for everyone</font>

34
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,000
one thing that I always say is that your

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,400
security is above all<font color="#E5E5E5"> else definitely</font>

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,990
protect yourself to do what you have to

37
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,760
do to make sure that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> safe and</font>

38
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,520
you're okay for me personally it I would

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,560
never choose to compromise mind and it's

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,330
just something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did when I was</font>

41
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,100
child and that's some things that I

42
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,570
promised myself I would never do again

43
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,430
you being scared that people aren't

44
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,560
gonna open doors for you because they

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,869
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like who you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or where you come</font>

46
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,299
from those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> serious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you shouldn't</font>

47
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,009
even let get in the way if you're

48
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">missing out on opportunities because of</font>

49
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,729
your job those might not be

50
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,049
opportunities you want in the first

51
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,450
place and trust me if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you catch up on</font>

52
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,240
those opportunities then ways are things

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,770
are going to follow me or<font color="#CCCCCC"> loss of the</font>

54
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,479
way it works it's called carbon I went

55
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,570
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ton of that of a lot of doors</font>

56
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,220
being slammed in my face for me to get

57
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,990
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I am right now and the same</font>

58
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,420
time the proudest of is the fact that

59
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm able to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've got here</font>

60
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,689
without compromising myself in the leaf

61
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,210
that's no excuse that's not to say that

62
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,210
it's cool or acceptable

63
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay by any means for an opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

64
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,770
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost on someone because their</font>

background or whatever walk of life they

67
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,760
may come from for us as as marginalized

68
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,190
people it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my response to it and</font>

69
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,260
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that we should respond</font>

70
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,100
to it is by us being loud AF and never

71
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,630
backing down and just keeps fighting

72
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,520
through it right like that's what people

73
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,830
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> sport they call for a fight so just</font>

74
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep fighting what do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think is the</font>

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">best way squared Arabic by going to Nair</font>

82
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,170
Arabic out of eighth grade level during

83
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,150
a time when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Arabic even</font>

86
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,660

95
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,820
for this one of a double major in

96
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,320
political science and middle eastern

97
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,680
studies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I double minored in</font>

98
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,790
international relations and one was in

99
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,010
understudies and I got a certificate in

advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> it against my little brothers</font>

104
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,260
when they started college I<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

105
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,049
like South programs overlap really well

106
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:47,030
and that were huge passionate interest

107
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,670
of mine and then I would basically find

108
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,799
classes that satisfy requirements for

109
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,930
multiple programs at once like killing

110
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,310

112
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:58,820
time to do it and it also was<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved</font>

113
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,320
with like every organization on campus

114
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,180
but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be involved in it was</font>

115
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,640
always

116
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,370
that didn't do well structure you know

117
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,740
what it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high school classroom or a</font>

118
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,990
Polish one I was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> person that kept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

119
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,680
walking into my classes like 30 minutes

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,529
late because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> under bed somewhere</font>

121
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,620
like doing something or i would give

class completely and my attendance

123
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,370

124
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,350
felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i were to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into practice</font>

125
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,880
the things that we were learning outside

126
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
of the classroom more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just didn't</font>

127
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,240
got a desk somewhere I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think she</font>

132
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,550
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a shared assurance</font>

133

136
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,640
impression because we're all too busy is

137
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,800
doing things and pushing back against us

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,780
to be depressed right now but a lot of

see a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplishments and</font>

157
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,200
milestones and they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a person</font>

158
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,640
can't have anything wrong there they

159
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,960
must<font color="#CCCCCC"> really feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> confident all the time</font>

160
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,419
and stuff when I was in college there

161
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a period of time where there was</font>

162
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,979
like a huge heartbreak conflict i had

163
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was dealing with and it reached a</font>

164
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,800
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where there were days where i was</font>

165
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,289
wondering if i was made to the next day

166
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,710
that's how bad it was

167
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,000
it was moments of hopelessness and total

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,830
English like those that just really

169
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,419
reminded me of how important my faceless

170
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,060
to me would not have gotten through that

171
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,380
survives on if i didn't have something

172
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,250
that I've we did so passionately like

173
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,870
that everything happens for a reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

174
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,600
cooked with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> by just recognizing that</font>

175
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,850
this was a new challenge that I had to

176
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,740
overcome and that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably change</font>

177
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,550
me for something bigger it was probably

178
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,530
exactly what I needed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever God</font>

179
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,449
had in store for games not really just

180
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,130

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,630
of the tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a really good</font>

undying loyalty I think I'm a really
