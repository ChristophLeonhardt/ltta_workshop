"Lumen" operates as an environment.
It's integrated with its context.
It's not an object.
So what you see here is the
main courtyard, which
features the largest
canopy within "Lumen."
"Lumen" is a project that is
composed of thousands of digitally knitted
cells and stalactite conical
forms, which you can see here.
In the interest of creating
multiple experiences,
and transformation of
materiality within "Lumen,"
an additional aspect that inspires
change and different types of uses
is the misting system.
So you can actually hear it
and see the nozzles within
the conical forms,
misting and providing
a sort of cool microclimate on
hot days.
And the photoluminescent threads
are also responsive.
If you were to come back at night,
the photoluminescent threads would
glow or emit knitted light.
