00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,785
LONGER THAN A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

164
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,253
PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, DESPITE WHATEVER CREDIBILITY

165
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,054
DESPITE WHATEVER CREDIBILITY ISSUES SHE MIGHT HAVE.

166
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:56,455
ISSUES SHE MIGHT HAVE. SHE IS SOMEONE WHO GETS

167
00:04:56,465 --> 00:04:57,590
SHE IS SOMEONE WHO GETS PRESIDENT TRUMP, AT LEAST IN HIS

168
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,991
PRESIDENT TRUMP, AT LEAST IN HIS PERSONALITY AND THE FACT HE WAS

169
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,893
PERSONALITY AND THE FACT HE WAS AN ENTERTAINER MUCH LIKE SHE IS

170
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:01,861
AN ENTERTAINER MUCH LIKE SHE IS AN ENTERTAINER.

171
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:04,297
AN ENTERTAINER. SO I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING

172
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:04,597
SO I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING THERE.

173
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:05,298
THERE. I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS

174
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,799
I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS

175
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,234
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS FORCEFULLY COME OUT AGAINST

176
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:08,601
FORCEFULLY COME OUT AGAINST OMAROSA.

177
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:09,769
OMAROSA. THEY SAID THEY FIRED HER

178
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,403
THEY SAID THEY FIRED HER SOMETHING LIKE FOUR TIMES.

179
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:13,005
SOMETHING LIKE FOUR TIMES. THEY TALK ABOUT THE IDEA SHE WAS

180
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:13,639
THEY TALK ABOUT THE IDEA SHE WAS A LOW LIFE.

181
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:14,807
A LOW LIFE. THE PRESIDENT JUST CALLED HER A

182
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,042
THE PRESIDENT JUST CALLED HER A LOW LIFE YESTERDAY.

183
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:17,577
LOW LIFE YESTERDAY. SO WHILE THIS RECORDING DOES

184
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:18,711
SO WHILE THIS RECORDING DOES HAVE THE PRESIDENT KIND OF BEING

185
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:20,413
HAVE THE PRESIDENT KIND OF BEING NICE TO HER AND SAYING, HEY, I

186
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:21,614
NICE TO HER AND SAYING, HEY, I DIDN’T THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE

187
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,182
DIDN’T THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE FIRED, THERE’S THIS IDEA THAT

188
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:25,084
FIRED, THERE’S THIS IDEA THAT OMAROSA IS TRYING TO SAY THAT

189
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:26,285
OMAROSA IS TRYING TO SAY THAT JOHN KELLY IS RUNNING THE WHITE

190
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:27,820
JOHN KELLY IS RUNNING THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN IN REALITY JOHN KELLY

191
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:28,921
HOUSE WHEN IN REALITY JOHN KELLY IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNING THE

192
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:29,688
IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNING THE STAFF OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

193
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:31,024
STAFF OF THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT

194
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,192
THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PERSONNEL DECISION

195
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:34,327
EVERY SINGLE PERSONNEL DECISION THAT HE MAKES.

196
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:34,827
THAT HE MAKES. >> YEAH.

197
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:37,630
>> YEAH. BUT I’M JUST WONDERING, EDDIE,

198
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,500
BUT I’M JUST WONDERING, EDDIE, AS WE STEP BACK OUT, JUST AGAIN

199
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:43,536
AS WE STEP BACK OUT, JUST AGAIN TALKING ABOUT THE TYPE OF PEOPLE

200
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,973
TALKING ABOUT THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT NOT ONLY DONALD TRUMP

201
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:48,841
THAT NOT ONLY DONALD TRUMP ATTACKS OR THAT HE HIRES, BUT

202
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:52,545
ATTACKS OR THAT HE HIRES, BUT THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT DONALD

203
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:53,813
THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT DONALD TRUMP IS HIMSELF.

204
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:55,448
TRUMP IS HIMSELF. THIS IS JUST ALL VERY CREEPY.

205
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:56,950
THIS IS JUST ALL VERY CREEPY. YOU HAVE TRUMP THAT, YOU KNOW,

206
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,886
YOU HAVE TRUMP THAT, YOU KNOW, USED TO GET ON THE PHONE AND

207
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:01,554
USED TO GET ON THE PHONE AND PRETEND THAT HE WAS JOHN BARON

208
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:04,257
PRETEND THAT HE WAS JOHN BARON OR WHOEVER HE WAS AS HIS PR GUY.

209
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:09,929
OR WHOEVER HE WAS AS HIS PR GUY. YOU HEARD THAT HE WOULD RECORD

210
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,164
YOU HEARD THAT HE WOULD RECORD CONVERSATIONS, AND NOW YOU HAVE

211
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,901
CONVERSATIONS, AND NOW YOU HAVE OMAROSA RECORDING CONVERSATIONS.

212
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:16,670
OMAROSA RECORDING CONVERSATIONS. YOU’VE GOT THE PRESIDENT’S

213
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,405
YOU’VE GOT THE PRESIDENT’S FORMER FIXER RECORDING

214
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:18,872
FORMER FIXER RECORDING CONVERSATIONS.

215
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:19,239
CONVERSATIONS. WHO KNOWS?

216
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,675
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE THEY’RE DOING IT, LIKE I

217
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:24,044
MAYBE THEY’RE DOING IT, LIKE I SAID, FOR THE SAME REASON MONICA

218
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,378
SAID, FOR THE SAME REASON MONICA KEPT THE DRESS, BECAUSE SHE KNEW

219
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:28,014
KEPT THE DRESS, BECAUSE SHE KNEW SHE WOULD BE ATTACKED AND NEEDED

220
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:28,381
SHE WOULD BE ATTACKED AND NEEDED EVIDENCE.

221
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:31,684
EVIDENCE. BUT IT JUST ALL SEEMS SO CREEPY

222
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:33,954
BUT IT JUST ALL SEEMS SO CREEPY TO ME, THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:35,255

227
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,865
DEFINED BY DEEP, AND SEEMS TO ME REASONABLE DISTRUST.

228
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,300
REASONABLE DISTRUST. >> IT IS REASONABLE, YEAH.

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,780
BUT IT FEELS LIKE WE’VE BEEN TABLOIDED.

234
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,915
TABLOIDED. >> TABLOIDIZED.

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,324
ASSAULT ON SERIOUSNESS, THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE MOMENT.

SERIOUSNESS OF THE MOMENT. IT IS LIKE WE’RE PASSING BY
