Paul Manafort is being investigated for his ties to foreign governments and the money that he's been paid by these foreign governments including Turkey and Russia and so interestingly enough there was a report today indicating that the FBI conducted what's known as a pre-dawn raid a no-knock raid of his home in late July so federal agents appeared at Paul mana Ford's home without advance warning in the pre-dawn hours of July 26th the day after he met voluntarily with the staff for the Senate Intelligence Committee real quick what's what's interesting is that mana forts team is saying that he's been cooperating there's no reason for them to do this rate he has given them all the documentation that they have asked for but the only time that these types of raid usually happened is when the person being investigated refuses to cooperate so look I don't know what's really going on behind the scenes manna fort could be telling the truth or it could be that he's not cooperating or investigators feel as though he's not being completely honest with them it could also mean in one other thing which is that that one they're not sure they think he might be cooperating but they're investigating for serious crimes so they're not going to take his word for it but secondarily you could also be a signal to them don't as Washington Post put it don't expect gentle treatment so we're not kidding around you are gonna go to jail and if if you if we catch you at cetera and you might also he might have deleted some of the documents if he I don't think he's stupid enough to have kept him on his home computer that would be monstrously stupid yes he worked for Trump but he's not Trump nobody's that dumb right so but even if you wiped him away we got some pretty good IT guys in the federal government and they might be able to find them anyway in your hard drive and so it's kind of a warning shot to him you better cooperate not necessarily about your case what about the other kids there's also another implication that his team is worried about and I think that I think that it's warranted so they're concerned that these investigators are attempting to make things so difficult for manna fort and they're trying really hard to find as much dirt on him as possible to kind of use against him as leverage so he can maybe disclose some of the financial ties that members of the Trump administration have or Trump himself has with the Russian government so this is prosecution 101 now so if they find that metaphor did something wrong even if it's not connected to the Trump campaign that he was a part of and remember he was Trump's campaign manager he was a huge part of the Trump campaign well first of all they found evidence of a crime they're not gonna cover that up and second of all that is how exactly how you get people to flip so they go now look Paul you know you're facing 20 to life now you could go in that direction have at it Hoss or you could give us evidence on another case that we're working on oh that happens to be the connections of Russia and Trump now if he doesn't have any evidence to give then he won't have any onus to give anyway and if he didn't commit a crime I mean this is conservative 101 right well if you didn't commit a crime he's got nothing to hide so there should be no problem at all by the way this has not done any kind of untoward way they got it did it exactly the right where you're supposed to under our system they got a warrant they went to a court they had an independent judicial body say yes you have enough evidence to go execute that warrant and get further evidence on manna Ford which already means he's in some degree of trouble right and and honestly that's extremely important for me I know people might have different opinions on doing it the right way with the warrant but regardless of someone's political motivations or regardless of how bad man affords ties to foreign governments might be I want to go through the process the legal way I want to make sure they get the proper warrants I want to make sure that justice is served and and justice means that we do go through the right channels the legal channels in order to prosecute someone fairly I studied law be I am technically a lawyer obviously I'm not a practicing one but back when I was in law school I also interned for a couple of prosecutors office and but you don't need any of these you just turn on the TV any other crime shows you're it's all over there what so for the people who are like well that's not right they shouldn't be investigating other crimes and they shouldn't use one crime as leverage to get information on another crime you don't know anything about prosecution if you're saying that of course that's that's exactly what you do as a prosecutor if you got a low-level drug dealer you get him on none this you could get them on drug dealing or you might get them on stealing your car or anything else and then you go now turning the actual higher-level drug dealer prosecution 101 but that it implies that there is actually something to prosecute and you don't know that until he actually turns in the evidence so let them go through their process do it the right way of course get a warrant nobody's interested in doing anything that isn't the American Way and the right way to do it with checks and balances and at the end let's see what they got watch the young turks commercial-free downloaded or stream it watch it any way you like a TYT Network comm /join
