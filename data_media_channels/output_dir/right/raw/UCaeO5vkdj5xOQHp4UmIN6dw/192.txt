1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,880
- I'm a computer
information science major,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,260
what can people getting into computers

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,483
do to help the conservative movement?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,520
- Tweet, you should tweet.
(audience laughing)

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,820
I'm actually, I am a Russian bot.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,460
So I don't know if you're
a Russian bot, too.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,840
But we could tweet, that
would be a great idea.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,030
It's very difficult the
place that you're in.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,250
Very often I get questions
from people in show business

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,180
who say, should I tell
people in show business

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,920
that I'm conservative, to which I say,

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,590
probably not if you want to work.

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,030
Google showed us that that's
probably the same in tech.

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,510
My friends who are in tech
largely are left wing,

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,220
those are not hospitable places.

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,220
Jack Dorsey, for all intents and purposes,

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,600
has admitted that he
has a leftist culture.

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,720
Google fired James Delmore.

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,280
One question you'll have to ask yourself,

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,750
as you get along in your career is

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,230
should you be open and public
and publicize your views,

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,420
or should you lay a little bit lower.

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,320
I can't answer that.

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,450
You probably know the answer
to that better than I do,

25
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,220
but I've been very open with my views,

26
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,700
it's probably cost me
professionally in certain areas,

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,750
but I don't really mind it.

28
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,890
But if you want to actually
work in that field,

29
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,058
you might have to play a longer game.

30
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,950
Be wise as a serpent
and innocent as a dove.

31
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,630
Unfortunately, today
we have a lot of people

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,890
who are as innocent as
serpents and wise as doves,

33
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,570
but you should do the opposite.

34
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,840
And I wish you luck.

35
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,860
And if you do make your way in there,

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,658
please stop censoring my show.

37
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:28,095
Stop it, man, get them to
let my show air, all right?

38
00:01:28,095 --> 00:00:00,000
(audience clapping)
