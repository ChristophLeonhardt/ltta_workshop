an undercover probe by Britain's channel for TV has revealed that tech giant Facebook doesn't always remove content even if it violates company's guidelines a reporter attended a six-week training session on Facebook's content moderation we now cross live to our T's ISA Ally for the details now you saw what prompted the investigation so this channel for documentary there dispatches as said they sent an undercover reporter to work for a contract called Cpl they provide services such as moderating content on behalf on behalf of Facebook and as part of their revelations they found that the social media giant was essentially protecting far-right groups and individuals at like Britain first like Tommy Robinson because those pages had huge followings and those huge followings meant revenue and actually in the documentary that's exactly what one of the contents one of the content moderators says to the undercover reports of that because pages like those belonging to Robinson are so hugely followed it means that Facebook don't want to get rid of them because of the revenue that they generate now another revelation to come out of that is that four pages such as the bigger ones like mr. Robinson's like Britain first Facebook actually take that out of the hands of these contractors and look after them in terms of moderation themselves so that they themselves can decide which pages are to be banned and which pages are to be allowed to continue now normal Facebook rules state that should a page violate the rules five times or more than the entire page gets taken down and not just the offending posts but again in the case of these pages that simply wasn't happening which is why it's led to claims that Facebook are actually protecting these individuals who are being accused of spreading hate now since that documentary and the revelations has come to the surface Facebook have responded and said that they are appreciative of those journalists for bringing it to their attention and that they are going to investigate we take this mistakes incredibly seriously and are grateful to the journalists who brought them to our attention we have been investigating exactly what happened so we can prevent these issues from happening again now who exactly is Tommy Robinson his real name is Steven Yaxley Lennon he was the former leader of the English Defence League the EDL and he was recently jailed for 13 months here in the UK because he was live streaming an ongoing trial to do with child grooming now that trial was subject to reporting restrictions in the media and mr. Robinson had previously been told in another instance by another judge not to do this kind of behavior and if he had done it again it would lead to a custodial sentence and that's what eventually happened now it would appear that despite mr. Robinson's breaking of well the law and Facebook's rules its money which decides for the social media giant which which behavior in which content is acceptable and which isn't and it's interesting because this comes as Ofcom the regulator here have warned those social media giants like Facebook and others that they have to do more to police their sites r2z saleh thank you for bringing us that report you
