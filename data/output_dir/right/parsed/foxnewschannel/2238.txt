AINSLEY: COMEDIAN MICHELLE
WOLF DOUBLING DOWN ON
INSULTING JE'KELS AT THE
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS
DINNER.
>> HONESTLY I WENT CHANGE A
SINGLE WORD THAT I SAID.
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT I
SAID.
AND I'M GLAD I STUCK TO MY
GUNS.
AINSLEY: WHO IS MITCHELL
WOLF AND WHY DIDN'T THE
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS
ASSOCIATION KNOW WHAT SHE
WAS GOING TO SAY.
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY IS A FOX
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
AINSLEY: SHE SAID I'M GLAD I
STUCK TO MY GUNS LIKE SHE IS
A MARTYR.
>> MICHELLE WOLF THIS WORKED
OUT WELL FOR HER.
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE KNEW
WHO SHE WAS BEFORE AND NOW
SHE IS MUCH MORE OF A COMMON
NAME.
IT REALLY ISN'T ABOUT
WHETHER SHE SHOULD
APOLOGIZE.
THIS IS WHO SHE IS.
THIS IS WHO SHE HAS BEEN.
I HAVE SEEN HER DO STANDUP
BEFORE WHEN SHE OPENED UP
FOR LOUIE C.K.
I WAS NOT SURPRISED BY WHAT
SHE DID ON THE DASE THERE.
SHE IS A WRITER FOR THE
DAILY SHOW.
UNEVEN POLITICAL COMMENTARY
ATTACKING REPUBLICANS AND
CONSERVATIVES AND PROTECTING
LIBERALS FOR A DECADE OR
MORE.
SO THIS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT
MICHELLE WOLF.
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS
ASSOCIATION AND WHY THEY
THOUGHT MICHELLE WOLF WOULD
BE A GOOD PERSON TO HAVE AT
THE EVENT KNOWING HER
HISTORY.
AINSLEY: MAYBE THEY KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE
GETTING.
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE
SOUND BITES SHE WAS A
COMEDIAN ON THE DAILY SHOW?
>> BEFORE YOU PUT TOO MUCH
HOPE IN IVANKA, REMEMBER,
SHE BROUGHT A BRAND OF
FESTIVAL THAT MAKES HER RICH
BY EXPLOITING THE VERY
PEOPLE SHE IS CLAIMING TO
HEM.
THAT'S NOT BEING A FEMINIST.
THAT'S BEING A TRUMP.
DONALD J. TRUMP YOU JUST
BECAME AMERICA'S BUTLER.
NOW, GO FIX OUR HEALTHCARE.
MAKE SHE A SANDWICH YOU
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE
BACK STORY IS?
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT
AND THE FOLKS THAT WORK FOR
THE DINNER ITSELF AND
ORGANIZE IT, DO YOU THINK
THEY KNEW WHO SHE WAS AND
WHAT THEY WERE GETTING?
>> THOSE CLIPS ARE A GOOD
REMINDER THAT THE BIG CRIME
FOR MICHELLE WOLF REALLY
THAT SHE WASN'T FUNNY AT AN
EVENT WHERE THAT WAS HER ONE
JOB TO BE FUNNY.
THIS IS, AGAIN, THIS IS
â™ª JUST MICHELLE WOLF.
THIS IS A PATTERN GOING BACK
MANY YEARS.
THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER IS A
VERY RITZY, VERY BIG AFFAIR
WHERE ALL OF D.C.
JOURNALISTS GET TOGETHER AND
COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER ON
WHAT A GREAT JOB THEY ARE
DOING EVEN AFTER YEARS OF
DOING DEMONSTRABLY BAD WORK
SUCH AS MISSING THE ENTIRE
STORY OF THE 2016 ELECTION.
OR COMING UP WITH CONSPIRACY
THEORIES ABOUT RUSSIA AND
PUSHING THEM DESPITE
EVIDENCE.
THEN THEY GIVE AWARDS TO
EACH OTHER OVER THEIR BAD
JOB.
THIS IS A DINNER THAT'S
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED.
THEY LIKE TO SAY THIS DINNER
IS ABOUT GIVING SCHOLARSHIPS
WHEN REALLY ANYBODY WHO
OBSERVES IT SEES THIS IS A
DINNER WHERE THEY DO LIGHT
JOKES AGAINST DEMOCRATS SUCH
AS DURING THE ENTIRE EIGHT
YEARS OF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WHERE THE
COMEDIANS OR THE TALENT
WOULD JUST AFOOSBALLLY
PRAISE OBAMA OR GO AFTER
REPUBLICANS OR WHEN
REPUBLICAN IS PRESIDENT
GOING AFTER REPUBLICANS.
GOING AFTER CONSERVATIVES
AND REPUBLICANS HARD AND
PERSONALLY AND LIGHTLY
JABBING THEIR OWN PEOPLE THE
MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS IS JUST
WHAT THE CORRESPONDENTS
DINNER HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR.
IT IS -- IT'S A PERFECT
ENCAPSULATION OF WHAT THE
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE
MEDIA RIGHT NOW.
IT WAS A VERY HONEST DINNER
ABOUT THE STATE OF D.C.
RIGHT NOW.
AINSLEY: THIS IS WHY THE
PRESIDENT REFUSES TO GO.
IS SHE AN ACTIVIST OR
