joining us now from the great state of Hawaii is Connie Ella Inge he is a just Democrat and he is in an interesting race there and boy Connie Ella you must gotta you must have him run as scared because I whenever a candidates doing well here comes a smear job so what's the one they unleashed on you well they went first of all thanks for having me on but the rumor has it or at least what we're hearing is that they hired one of the best opposition researchers from DC this guy was notorious who's Chuck Schumer's guy and they paid him tens of thousands of dollars to fly to Hawaii and dig up a folder about everything that they could possibly use negative against me so there's you know accusing me of all sorts of things looked at my LinkedIn profile and things that were not updated and you know just just throwing the book at me so we're just trying to get beyond that it's called an apple dump right they fed it to the media and it's it's kind of expected because we've been calling out a lot of the forces that not just control our politics but also our the advertisers for corporate media and they pay these people's salaries right so in Hawaii that's like luxury developers that's the longline fishing lobby that's corporations like Monsanto so we expected this much but it seems like this is about more than the race they want to make an example out of me and stop the progressive movement and it tracks here so we're just talking about the issues pushing it not just Medicare for all ending reckless wars that free college pushing the envelope talking about student loan cancellation universal basic income federal job guarantee and of course getting money out of politics rejecting all corporate PAC money this is the first time it's ever been done in this district I think that's part of the problem too there's never been a candidate who was fully funded by the people and you know 5,000 donors this race by far the district record averaging around $20 at a time and you know I don't think that the establishment is afraid of me I think they're afraid of those people is 5,000 who are building a movement hearing about you so part of the problem is the you have our research I've never it and correct me if I'm wrong I've just never seen a progressive candidate that had an opera research part of their campaign whereas almost all the establishment Democrats have an opera research team so then you run into an uneven playing field I bet you if I went in to your primary opponents LinkedIn she probably didn't refresh it either but we never get to find out about that yeah I mean there's all sorts of stuff going on and it does seem like the skels is often tilted to one side but yeah I mean our donor our donors are like working-class people all right chipping in $5 $10 I was $1 at a time they're not rich people who are investing like you said in in the races to see windfalls later in their corporation so every dollar counts and it's idea that I'm gonna use the money that these working people give me to just smear my opponents just seem very unattractive for me looking back maybe it's like necessary but it just just seemed like such a bad way to campaign or rather inspire people with in affirmative vision like of a better world you know where people have health care and they can afford homes here in Hawaii when right now for my generation you gotta be making $200,000 a year out of high school or college just to be in the middle class to afford a home because homes are seventy seven hundred seventy thousand dollars now so you know that that's what I want to talk about I don't want to be talking about how like how many homes my opponent owns or what kind of suits he wears or whatever it's just not it's just I don't feel like that's what people care about but that's all we tend to see in the corporate media because because of the incentives so you know we're just sticking to the issues and continuing to build a positive movement and try our best to just brush it off and keep trucking along so I'm with two minds on that Kayne Ellis so I mean here you are you got a ton of momentum and you're doing great and they try to stop your new tracks by by doing the smear job right so and and Bernie Sanders didn't ahead Hillary Clinton either right and a lot of us progressive asked him to hit her but it's not in his nature and he didn't do it but they started Oppo research on Bernie right now political did two negative articles about him this week back to back right so the 20/20 smears have begun loading in in race like yours by the way cannula I know you're doing great because there are no smears and campaigns that aren't doing well alright they don't bother to send Schumer's guy out right so maybe the answer is to fight back against the media because it's I doing spending people's money on Oppo research of your opponent and finding out you know what they did wrong back in nineteen eighty seven instead of those kind of stuff that they do is one thing it's another thing to say hey media where did you get that story right did you go and and look it up yourself it was your idea why don't you be honest about it right who gave you that story so they never ever talk about it they make it seem like oh man I'm an enterprising young reporter and golly gee look at what I dug up so III don't know what you're taking on that cuz it's you you can't just have it be one side well first of all I should say that you know one of the complaints has been some like misreporting in my past races when I was in my early 20s and we don't working full-time and campaigning and also trying to do the counting so you know one person thing ten jobs I have made mistakes and you know I'm taking ownership for them and uh you know do whatever I can to fix it in the meantime the fact that that's been dug up on me and not other candidates who have similar irregularities is uh is concerning and I do think there's there's some sort of bias there so you know it I think it's fair to call a spade a spade but also just to ask media like you know why aren't you talking about these issues that that matter to people like we had a video where I talked about like the things holding that change here nobody how the same people who donate the Donald Trump are donating to Democrats yet the Democrats want to despite Trump and pretend it takes courage to stand up to Donald Trump in a blue state where ninety percent of people hate him and I said that in a speech right and it went viral over nine point four million people have seen it is the most watched congressional video in the nation but that doesn't make the news there because I'm exposing the people that are kind of controlling our politics here in Hawaii and speaking with a new level of truth that's rare so if someone's speaking truth and they're gonna say you know this person is inauthentic and here's why if someone's young and refreshing you're gonna say well it's immature and irresponsible and that's kind of the narrative and then they fit all the opposition into that narrative so that's what's happening here and it's maybe that's that's just that the tap you're taking now I don't I don't mind looking at comparing my record to my opponents record I think that's fair that's what campaign should be all about I'm the only candidate in this race who of course does not accept any corporate PAC money but I'm the only kind of championing debt-free college or tuition free college a medicare-for-all ending reckless Wars abolishing ice where I'm the only candidate just not even progressive values just baseline democratic values all three out of four of my opponents have histories opposing marriage equality a woman's reproductive freedom and criminal justice reform so it's just when you talk about the issues and you know our records we're gonna win and we don't really need to talk about the personal stuff really yeah I mean look you're pointing out two different things that makes me way angrier than you are even though you're the one being attacked so number one is you're right you never get positive coverage when's the last time they so hilarious that they call the mainstream media liberal when's the last time any liberal got any positive coverage for the mainstream media I mean that viral video of yours and I saw it nine point four million views for a congressional candidate who's not an incumbent I mean that is astounding that should have been all over the news in Hawaii oh my god are this native son of Hawaii is on fire the whole world is watching his video right and and that's probably more views than almost all other candidates in the country combined I can't overstate that that is that's huge right nothing nothing and then on the other side did that same reporter I'm way angrier than you are the that same reporter dig into the same exact campaign finance records of all your opponent's no no way they did so when you just do to one candidate that tells me that you were targeting that candidate and by the way it wasn't even you it was a apparatchik who gave you that and you pretend to be a reporter now if the apparatchik gave you that and then you and your did your independent research and looked at all the candidates in the race that's a different story but they don't do that so they ate an event the destruction of progressives so anyway that's your art for staying positive brother all right so look give us a sense before you go although I'm gonna look up that report I'm gonna come for them anyway give us a sense of the state of your race and why they chose to attack you in the first place because obviously you've got momentum they're not gonna bother doing it otherwise so how many volunteers do you have any other positive news in the race yeah we have hundreds of volunteers signed up over 5,000 individual donors of the stated earlier phone banking's every day canvassing every weekend we're picking up a lot of momentum and we're speaking the truth with a new level of truth that hasn't ever before what's seen here and how about you before so it's exciting I'm really encouraged of course we need a lot more support as most of these progressive candidates we cannot raise as much as the Machine candidates can we're talking about Lockheed Martin Boeing the longline fishing Lobby that's gonna wipe out tuna from the ocean if you guys like sushi you should support our campaign oil I just don't hit no seriously like tuna will be gone by 2040 in Hawaii we're like control the fish supply here and this Lobby does not want any protections they're one of the biggest lobbies here same goes for Monsanto so same goes for Big Oil there with an anti solar corporation that's trying to take over our utility here in Hawaii and these are problems that are happening all across the nation how more islands will be underwater within my son's lifetime unless we act on climate now so that's why we're taking such aggressive stances and we're naming names it's never been done before because that's not Aloha right that's not Aloha style to name names what's not a law is allowing like these corporations to trample over the most vulnerable people in our society the people we love and that's what's happening that's what's been happening in in my lifetime and it's just so sad to see seventy percent on my classmates moved to the mainland they couldn't afford it here I have a two year old son I just want to make sure here the shot right that's why we do this work and that's why you know if any of your viewers can chip in whatever they can to Kanye low income just $5 $10 whatever you can afford it goes a long way I think last time we're on the show we had a quite a big boost of a few thousand dollars and that kind of thing really helps because look if I say this in a TV ad even though we don't really like TV that's how most you know elderly voters get their information if we say these things in an ad it's gonna stick more than the plastic stuff that my opponents are saying right because we're able to be more honest and so you know if we can get this message on TV and on the radio and continue to knock on doors like I did since my first race we're gonna win so so please you know whatever you can do right any if you watch this video later we'll have a links down below for donating volunteering etc but anyone watching it live or otherwise kaniela ENCOM okay and and get in the fight and look if you if you're if you're out there and you're watching this interview and you're anywhere near so mad as I am about the non-stopping attack against progressives circle the wagons man circle the wagons to support your own so con yell is out there fighting and if you know you should watch my previous centers with them the way you got elected in the first place by knocking on every voters door three times it's one of the greatest stories I've ever heard so cannula I'm a believer so keep fighting brother thank you this is our fight especially our generation you know the it's been rigged against us so we got it we got to join in this battle and we gotta seize power it's not going to be given to us they're not gonna relinquish the Sidra we need a revolution to take it back there you go okay all right thank you man thanks for joining us
