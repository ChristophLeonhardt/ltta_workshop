“I’m David Gordon Green,
director of “Halloween.”
With horror movies,
it’s as much
of what you’re not showing
as what you are showing.
One of the things that
we talked about a lot
on set and in the edit room
is surprise versus suspense.
The same is in this sequence.
We’re having
Laurie and Michael
preparing for their final
confrontation in the movie.
We shot it in two
ways, where we
could track Michael, track
Laurie, and then build
to this encounter.”
“Michael’s here.
Get downstairs.
(SCREAMING) Go, baby, go!”
“One of the invaluable
assets that we
had on this production was
the master of horror himself.
John Carpenter was not only
a godfather to our project,
the originator of
these characters,
but also a creative
collaborator.
He did the score, and was
an advisor and counsel,
executive producer
on the film.
A sequence like this, we let
the actors do their thing.
It was not scripted dialogue.
We kind of set
up the scenario,
put two cameras
in an environment,
and then let the
actors just play.
We probably did three
takes of the sequence.
It was a heightened
anxiety, and we really
wanted to give the
audience that uncertainty
before the reveal of Michael.”
