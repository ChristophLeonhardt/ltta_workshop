This is John
Krasinski, the director
and one of the actors
in “A Quiet Place."
What you’re watching now
is at the very beginning
of the movie.
This is our hero
family walking home
from a — now established
as an abandoned town.
And this sort of sets up a lot
of the rules of the movie, one
of which you’re
seeing right here,
which is the idea of
perspective and sound.
When we’re close
up on something,
you can really hear it.
And then when you
go to a wider shot,
you can’t hear that
exact same sound,
which is one of the things
we really loved doing
throughout the whole movie.
We shot this film
in Upstate New York.
The idea was to be in a
very rural area in sort
of a post-apocalyptic
time to feel isolation.
And so being in the
middle of nowhere
helps this family
feel like they’re
in the middle of nowhere.
And it adds tension,
I think, to the fact
that they have nowhere to
turn or nobody around them
to help them.
Sound design in this is huge.
It’s totally a main
character that is right along
here with the family.
So Millie, one of the
actresses, is a deaf actress.
And we’re about to do
one of my favorite things
in the movie, which is
play with her perspective.
We wanted the sound of
the movie to reflect
her own actual experience.
So you can hear sound when
you’re walking with Emily
and I, like this, and with Noah.
And then right here, you cut to
Millie, and we pull sound out.
So we’re in “the envelope,"
we called it — the envelope
being in her head, she can
hear very little thanks
to a hearing aid that she has.
But she can’t hear
much of anything.
And so we play with that
throughout the entire movie.
So she can’t tell that
there’s a sound being
made behind her right now.
And so this is her
perspective — seeing me run,
seeing me look scared,
but she doesn’t know why.
And then she
realizes right here.
And when she realizes is
that her little brother just
made the first big
sound of the movie.
And you can see that that sound
has horrible consequences.
