00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,850
“I’m David Gordon Green,
director of “Halloween.”

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,540
With horror movies,
it’s as much

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,047
of what you’re not showing
as what you are showing.

4
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:10,880
One of the things that
we talked about a lot

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,000
on set and in the edit room
is surprise versus suspense.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,300
The same is in this sequence.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,900
We’re having
Laurie and Michael

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,450
preparing for their final
confrontation in the movie.

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,980
We shot it in two
ways, where we

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,040
could track Michael, track
Laurie, and then build

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,935
to this encounter.”

12
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:27,870
“Michael’s here.

13
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,760
Get downstairs.

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,180
(SCREAMING) Go, baby, go!”

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,070
“One of the invaluable
assets that we

16
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,430
had on this production was
the master of horror himself.

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,142
John Carpenter was not only
a godfather to our project,

18
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,600
the originator of
these characters,

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,450
but also a creative
collaborator.

20
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,270
He did the score, and was
an advisor and counsel,

21
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,540
executive producer
on the film.

22
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,970
A sequence like this, we let
the actors do their thing.

23
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,650
It was not scripted dialogue.

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,380
We kind of set
up the scenario,

25
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,920
put two cameras
in an environment,

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,390
and then let the
actors just play.

27
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,760
We probably did three
takes of the sequence.

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,129
It was a heightened
anxiety, and we really

29
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,020
wanted to give the
audience that uncertainty

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,270
before the reveal of Michael.”
