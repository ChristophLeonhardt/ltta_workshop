the French interior minister met police officers in Calais deployed to stop fighting between hundreds of refugees on Thursday five eretrians were shot in the violence The Situation's Yahav column said was unacceptable we see we've reached a new level of violence an escalation of violence that's become completely unbearable for the people of Calais and for the migrants we can't allow a sense of survival of the fittest in our country so yes we'll do things everywhere we can police say a hundred Afghan and thirty Eritrean refugees fought for nearly two hours on the outskirts of the city they were a charity food hand out when gunfire triggered the clashes police are searching for an Afghan man in connection with the shooting this is one of the main areas where the fighting took place and what the French Interior Minister is saying is that organized gangs are behind much of this violence and there's no doubt when you speak to refugees here what many of them tell us is that people smugglers have been increasingly active security is high in Calais traffickers target refugees who want to cross the English Channel and reach the UK there are some people they have some power they're just they are collect the money to to enter that track or that glory for the refugees stuck here the conditions are grim activists say the difficulties are fueling tensions the conditions are seriously challenging here and help refugees and other organisations have spoken repeatedly about this and and warned about the the context in which people are living which also has potential for sparking into the kind of situation that we saw yesterday the French government says it will not allow camps in Calais and security will be boosted but for now it seems little can deter the many desperate refugees who continue to arrive here each day in the hope of a better life Natasha Butler al Jazeera Calais
