more than 100 people killed in just one day in Syria's rebel-held areas of eastern Goethe and Edith they were supposed to be part of the so-called de-escalation zones but the bombing has intensified so what triggered this and who can stop it this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm fully battable the truce was supposed to bring temporary relief to hundreds of thousands of Syrians suffering from severe food and medicine shortages instead Russian and Syrian government forces launched a new wave of airstrikes and shelling plunging besieged rebel-held areas into even more despair more than 100 people have been killed in the past 24 hours in eastern Goethe just outside the capital damascus and italy province activists have described it as one of the most violent days in a nearly seven-year conflict the region's targeted by the Syrian government and his Russian Ally are supposed to be in a so-called de-escalation zones part of a russian-led ceasefire deal for territory held by the rebels the UN says the increasing violence is making a mockery of these zones and has called for a month-long truths to allow the delivery of aid now the for de-escalation zones were created after many rounds of talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana and were meant to reduce violence protect civilians and ensure humanitarian access to mainly opposition-held areas Russia Turkey and Iran who signed the deal act as guarantors now the exact borders of those zones remain unclear but they cover parts of Idlib and Latakia province western areas of Aleppo and northern areas of Hama the second zone is eastern Goethe in the northern countryside of damascus where over 400,000 people have been besieged by government forces for the past four years the third de-escalation zone is in parts of northern Homs and finally the last one is further down to the south along the border with Jordan so let's bring in our guest for today's inside story joining us in Moscow Dmitry filarsky political analysts who researches Russian Affairs in the Middle East in Beirut Hisham Chabert a retired Lebanese army general and joining us also from arezzo in Italy joshua landis director of the center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma gentlemen thank you for being on Inside Story welcome to the show Dimitri in Moscow if I can start with you Russia was the main guarantor of these de-escalation zones and now is Lee in the onslaught of airstrikes in Italy province and civilians are bearing the brunt of these strikes what happened to Russia wanting to reach a compromise in Syria well I think if we look at what's the Russian general policy in Syria it's important to look at what's happened in Sochi just recently and this the conference that took place is pretty much it's is the posture of the single Astana Sochi peace process and by Russian standards there has been a success there has been a right now there is a way for creating a constitution the Syria is somehow a transitional body and so right now Russia pretty much feels that it's on the path for bringing the Syrian reconstruction to Syria and the same time in doing it on our own terms in Astana as you say and talk of reconstruction when at the same time they're bombing these areas in Syria well again Russia even thought the Putin has announced that they're gonna start to his drone troops from the country it is never - is the Moscow is never about to leave this area and the basis there will stay for many many decades for now in Russia but they won't stop bombed in Syria unless this 75% of Detroiter right now pretty much will be controlled by the Damascus I mean we could speak that the northern part of the Syria were the so-called the buffer zone created by Washington who remain intact but the majority of Syria 75% will be right now pretty much whether attacked by Bashar Assad or Russian until the control over there isn't fully joshua landis the agreement on the de-escalation zones had many people thinking that the war in syria could finally be winding down worthy ceasefires ever meant to hold in your view well the cease fires were really negotiated by the for the United States because everybody wanted to fight Isis the United States was very eager to fight Isis Isis is now largely destroyed and all the great powers are trying to grab as much land as they can the United States has grabbed 28% of Syria in the north with most of its oil and good resources turkey is grabbing a freeing and wants to consolidate in it Lib and Syria of course is trying to take the last pockets of rebel resistance and that's why the who does being pounded they're moving down towards the Jordan border and of course making a big push to keep the Turks from taking much of it Lib so they're trying to take back in the province this is the endgame as people jostle for control turkey in America want leverage Assad wants as much of his country as he can get Hisham Jabbar in Beirut your view on this the first weeks of 2018 certainly have been very bloody of a very bloody period in Syria's seven years civil war what do you think the strategy is here from the Assad government in its Russian ally why are we seeing this new push this aggressive push at a time when they are winning militarily on the ground when they have regained so much territory of course one Moscow tried to find a peaceful solution try to play the role of sponsor and Sochi Astana cetera on the land who have to make advance and the land to make again and in the military success cell look at the map in Syria find mr. offer at the American control region especially what the Kurds are and the western side of of Syria especially in each lab and north and Athene and Aleppo and Hama and Hamas a Moscow is playing to explain the role of the sponsor or find a solution it's normal that military escalation is normal expression in ED lab after the shutdown the Sukhoi you know they took advantage the Russia Russia Moscow took advantage from this for escalate their operation and order to solve the problem of adept later on with the combination of Turkey turkey was given you know a price you know for example an exchange of adlet was given a free a green light from Moscow a yellow light from Washington for example I think the scenario and north of Syria will be like separated thing a dream they are several fronts as you say and I just want to come back to what happened in Italy over the weekend you say that the current offensive we're seeing from the Syrian government and Russia is normal militarily and at the same time we're seeing that the rebels are not backing down I mean the rebels you know were involved in an incident this weekend where there is said to have used the a man-portable air-defense system to shoot down a Russian warplane this is considered a sophisticated weapon Hisham Chabert where would they have found this you know this weapon what kind of support are the rebels getting right now and where is it coming from I'm not saying right now who gave those missiles to the rebel and when I believe - you know solution some observers said and most of them was given by providers wouldn't the last three years like because they are they were provided by several a most of second weapon but was tenant by provider not not use it until a new order the other solution they pretend they some observers said they were second buy from I'm serious military bases but this you know this solution is difficult to believe first of all the Syrian youth use sam-7 as a missile land air and mother earth the first system of Syria was not you know no one tell us that they took such waters second they were shelling by the Syrian Air Force several times for them traitors ten years they did not use it okay no I see your point through Turkey yeah I see your point and I just want to hear from joshua landis are on this because that we want to talk a bit more about this incident in Italy and Joshua where are the rebels getting their support from right now where is it coming from and how concerned should the the Russians and the Syrian government be that they have access it seems to such sophisticated weaponry now well we don't know exactly where the weapons come from the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia said a year ago that it was going to supply the Syrian rebels with ground-to-air missiles to shoot down Russian planes it's quite possible that it actually did it and it wasn't just threatening it could be Turkey it could be many places where these get smuggled in clearly the rebels desperately need these sorts of ground-to-air missiles in order to neutralize Soviet planes the Soviets have 70 Soviets excuse me the Russians have said that they're just simply going to fly their airplanes higher in the air where they won't be vulnerable to these missiles so this is a deterrent but it won't make a big difference I don't think this is the endgame Syria is trying to push the rebels from it live into Turkey and get rid of them turkey does not want that to happen and it's going to help the rebels push back a little bit properly Dmitry do you agree with Josh were they about what Russia's endgame is in Syria right now and I also want to ask you about you know whether Russia is concerned or not about the type of weapons the rebels seem to be using now in the fact that they're not backing down despite the intense airstrikes and you know the the intense offensive against them well first to answer your question about the weapons again there is there's been always concerned about this kind of weapons in Russia there are some ideas that the weapons are coming for probably from diluted storages all across the Syria after the Syrian army or the perhaps coming from Ukraine or somehow transported things to countries or Saudi or Turkish efforts so we never know but in Russia there is differently concerned about it and I think one of the reasons if you look at what's happened to the plane is pretty much this whole a situation when the plane got shut downs happen primarily because the plane was flying lower than it Russian socially expected and this also has been some human factor as many people in Russian saying so that's pretty much has been kind of pilots fault as well because the Russians pretty much know that this the rebels they always have this kind of weapons it's only was only matter when they used it well the Russians will make mistake for the plane to get shot if and if saying in terms of the Indians fine fighting well right now it's pretty much if you look at the ad lib it's pretty much one of the last remaining stronghold in Syria and those remain fractions of rebels are still fighting there and obviously they will fight until they and these people just have nowhere to go they just have to fight that they couldn't get back through the Turkish territory they couldn't give up so they couldn't do anything so for them fighting last resort and obviously right now fighters have been intensified and yes understand as well Hisham Jabbar in Beirut just coming back to the current government strategy the Assad government strategy right now and looking specifically at eastern Goethe on the outskirts of Damascus which has been under siege now for almost four years by government forces that strategy doesn't seem to have worked there are some reports now suggesting that the Assad regime could be considering a ground offensive there how risky would that be yeah first of all let me that something whoever about the missile whoever provide the surgeon by this method or other missiles and when those missiles delivered to the insertion through the borders of Turkey whether 2 years or 3 years ago second why as a droite astrology - officer first of all at the north of Syria I said the second advantage from the situation and north of Syria and Turkish involvement and - is making a very big again under Lane success and the three angles between Aleppo and south except and north of Hama it's very important to protect to protect the the highway between Aleppo and Damascus and and every day they can make a new advance and order to solve the problem as adept on the table right later on with comprehension a second and the eastern side of Damascus as only two places two fronts the Syrian army is fighting and now the Syrian army is in a situation of break of relax he has only two fronts sense the Kuta Eastern water threatened Damascus itself every day every week some training to Damascus why not take advantage this time and to let a big offensive against to solve try to to push away the neck surgeon from domestic let's move the discussion forward now because with all of this happening across Syria the United Nations has said it's investigating reports of another chemical weapons attack in rebel-held areas the US has accused the Syrian government of continuing to use these types of weapons bomb suspected of containing chlorine were reportedly dropped in duma in eastern goot on thursday and this was followed by another attack later in the town of Saraqeb in Italy province activists video appears to show people being treated for suffocation and a foul smell was reported the Syrian government denies it was behind these attacks joshua landis Donald Trump last year when there was another chemical weapons attack in Syria launched airstrikes there was a targeted strike in response to to that air strike at - the chemical weapons attack use at the time and many have seen as as a key test of Trump's leadership on the world stage do you think we could see the u.s. take a similar action now that there are new reports of chemical attacks use against civilians it's possible the u.s. the u.s. seems to have made a small distinction between nerve gas which was used in Conshohocken where the United States responded very vigorously that had been prescribed in the original deal with Syria in 2013 the chlorine which is not quite not as anywhere near as deadly but of course is is very bad is very widespread it's used for swimming pools clearing water it's used for pharmaceuticals it's all over the place very hard to keep it out of Syria and the United States I think is reluctant to get drawn in to reprisals against Syria on the use of chlorine but it may do it it's it's unclear what Washington's policy is right now it seems to be going through a period of change I saw Tillerson and others say that they want regime change and that they're going to stay in Syria until Assad is removed from government and that there are free elections run by the UN this is a very new policy and I'm not sure it's really sunk in yet right in Washington all the different corridors of power we'll see Dmitry what would the Russian reaction be if the US were to decide to get further involved in the Syrian conflict in response for instance to this reported chemical weapons attack well I think here is interesting if we look at the US policy in Syria in red perspective and will measure will measure like its US involvement over the past few years I mean like and from in in Russian right now what's happened with the creation of a buffer zone and drum strikes in in during the last year it's pretty much seen that on the and begin a Russians thought that the would trump policy toward Syria will be different than Obama's and right now people actually think that Trump is actually going to take more aggressive stance towards Syria and this pretty much has been proven recently by this creation of the buffer zone at the same time I think that Russians are pretty confident that United States will not strike Syria it has happened in the last year and pretty much they believe that the whole US influence four remain within the established buffer zone speaking of changing policies on Syria it is Russia today still intent on having Bashar al-assad remain in power in Syria because at one point they seem to be flexible almost on the idea of Assad not being in power what's what's their position right now on Bashar Assad well I think that's actually a great question because if you look at general what how Russia Syria and I think there has been very mistaken consideration that Russia has made all of it bets on Bashar I mean like for Russia there's only one thing that matters for Russia is happen in Syria reliable and still stable client state that could supply this sort of foothold for its Navy base at first basis and some fluency in the Middle East and it doesn't really matter whether it's Bashar Assad or somebody else but it has to be somebody who's loyal to Russia right now obviously there is nobody no such alternative but it's very pro-russian in Syria and I think in the upcoming years I mean we probably have Bashar Assad remaining power and then we'll see al goes hisham Chabert what is your view of Russia's endgame and this now is beyond Syria what do you see as Russia's endgame in in this region right now in the Middle East and who do you think is benefiting from prolonged Russian involvement whether its interior other areas in the region you see Russia has interest in Syria for the first time meta clear that arrived to dominate the Mediterranean made a naval patient our tools and you know average and and and also Latakia anyway Russia didn't come to Syria to live tomorrow has a lot of interest and has want to influence in Syria and motto the Russia don't want occupy Syria but want an Android Syria seems a very rich region you know for the oil and gas and natural resources and we we saw in that disorder you know the fighting there around death oil resources anyway Syria one it's a part in the Syrian cake it's normal weather as I'd say an energy effort Russia want to expand the Syrian cake weather as I'd say in a regime or not arrested rush Assad present a large part of the Syrian people Russia want a regime not or style - Russia - Moscow and protect its interests and see what what Russia want ok well let me give the last word to joshua landis in a reso and joshua i want to come back to the current situation in syria today the Civil War is now entering its seventh year we've seen in the last 48 hours more than a hundred people killed in Italy in eastern Goethe civilians really bearing the brunt of this conflict the humanitarian situation is disastrous as the UN has said where does this all leave this current escalation where does this leave peace efforts whether it's Astana whether it's Sochi whether it's Geneva can they be a negotiated solution still in Syria or is this war only going to be one and settled on the battlefield I think it's going to be settled on the battlefield it seems quite clear both Geneva is really a dead process Geneva is hooked up on asking for Assad's removal it doesn't look like he's going to be removed Astana is really a a vehicle for getting the surrender of the remaining rebel groups and that's going to be done with this fight on the ground and that's why you're seeing the war escalate now because there's a scramble for the last bits of Syria as everybody tries to get leverage America turkey trying to increase their their hold on on Syrian territory and Assad is racing to drive the rebels out and not to give any more pretext to Turkey to take more land or to the United States to increase its position in Syria so this is the I think we're seeing the end of this and there's an all-out rush to grab the last bits of Syria that are held by rebels certainly an unfortunate situation for the civilians there thank you all for taking part in this discussion Dmitry for laughs key Hisham Jabbar and joshua landis thank you for being on inside story and thank you for watching as always you can watch this program again anytime by going to our websites at Al Jazeera dot-com for further discussion go to our Facebook page at facebook.com /h a inside story and of course you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me fully battable and the whole team here at inside story thank you for watching bye for now you you
