a breaking piece of news with regard to Roy more allegations Al Franken fallout plus CNN does its best to go after Trump on Russia and falls directly on its face as does the entire media I'll tell you about that one plus the mailbag I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so the news coming fast and furious today if my energy level seems a little bit down is just because I was back from San Francisco I was there last night doing sam Harris's podcast was really entertaining and fun Tim's a really good guy and while we disagree strenuously on issues regarding religion we have a lot of agreement about how arguments are to be approached and so it was really entertaining a good time that podcast should be up I think in the next couple of weeks is some time so you should listen for that but I want to get to all the latest news particularly a piece of breaking news with regard to Roy Moore's chief accuser there really - chief accusers in the Roy Moore case one is a woman named Lee Kaufman who says when she was 14 years old that Roy Moore attempted to molest her and a woman named Beverly young Nelson who accused Roy Moore of basically putting on her car and almost attempting to rape her when she was 16 years old she's the one of course who came out with the yearbook the signed yearbook we'll talk about a breaking piece of news in that case that really throws Beverly young

remember her we played significant portions of her audio when she first broke news was sitting next to the execrable Gloria Allred that she was allegedly molested by Roy Moore the Senate Republican candidate in Alabama when she was 16 years old so all the way back in 1977 she claims that Roy Moore had met her at a restaurant was hitting on her wrote her a note in her yearbook and then one night when she wouldn't when she'd have a ride home he offered to give her a ride brought around the back in the car to lock the door and then proceeded to try to molest her that was her claim and she trotted out this yearbook as proof that she knew Roy Moore because Moore said he never met her he'd know who she was so she trotted out this yearbook and Moore said it's a forgery and she said it's not a forgery and actually Gloria Allred went even further to Gloria Allred said the entire thing the entire thing is genuine and the entire thing was written by Roy Moore well a very bad thing happened on the way to Beverly young Nelson's credibility okay and that is that Beverly young Nelson admitted in an interview with ABC News that she wrote part of the inscription now she didn't write according to heard the actual note she didn't write Roy Moore's actual signature but she did write the date and the place underneath right now the reason that this is a problem I'll show you I'll show you what she had to say the reason this is a problem is because if they just come out at the very beginning and they'd said Roy Moore wrote this note and then to remind myself where this was I wrote the eight and the place underneath right just like you would on the back of a photo everybody would have gone okay especially because there's now a second note that Roy Moore wrote a graduation card to a seventeen-year-old that looks very much like this no right the signatures look pretty much the same but because people were automatically saying this was a forgery and because Gloria Allred refused to turn it over to any sort of impartial third hand source or secondhand source or refused to turn over to any sort of handwriting expert because of all that this now throws the entire story in jeopardy here's Beverly young Nelson talking about this and admitting that she wrote the little inscription under the note Young's proof that she knew more her yearbook with this inscription but Moore and his supporters have called into question that inscription noting the riding under the signature appears to be different let's look at Beverly Nelson everybody knows her in yearbook is a forgery Nelson says she did make notes to the inscription but the message was all Rome or Beverly he signed your yearbook he did sign it and you made some notes underneath yes okay so how number one does the GMA reporter who's reporting that's not ask why when were the notes made what were the specific notes made right it says the date and the and the and the the place the this steakhouse that apparently she worked now does this throw the entire story into into severe a credibility crisis not quite because Roy Moore said he never knew the woman he said that the restaurant didn't exist the signatures again looked the same they should submit it now to an independent handwriting expert they should have already Gloria Allred is a hack it's unbelievable to me that Gloria Allred's didn't submit this in the first place but there is a tendency to run too far with the story so I'm seeing headlines today as a headline from Breitbart bombshell she admits she forged the signature no she did not admit she forward us the signature what you just saw is the entirety of the tape right the actual headline over at Breitbart right now I want to make sure that I don't I don't give a steer you bomb on what exactly their headline is bombshell more accuser admits forging yearbook silence for weeks as evidence of hoax grew write more admits admits forging yearbook she did not admit forging the yearbook she admitted to writing a note underneath the signature so again this throws no credit to things can be true at once won her credibility can be it can have serious problems now because she didn't admit the from the start and because gloria allred openly stated the entire thing was written by this woman but it's also true that she didn't admit to forging the entire note she specifically said she didn't Forge the entire note in this particular element so I don't know why people have to lie about what yeah I really don't know why people have to lie about what exactly she admitted in order to throw this woman's credibility into crisis I don't really understand how how that's the case it's it's confusing to me but again it does have a real credibility problem and there gonna be a lot of people who hang their hats on this peg now again she's not the only accuser against forum or there's another accuser who says she was molested when she was 14 that was the one that was tracked down by the Washington Post they're a bunch of other women who say that Roy Moore was dating them and trying to kiss them and hit on them when they were under the age of 18 there were many of those women there were reports that he was banned from the local food court at the mall but all of that said is this a problem for beverly young nelson it is but it shows the dishonesty of our politics number one that gloria allred didn't admit this stuff up front and number two that GMA didn't bother to press the questions and number three the people are now saying this discredit the entirety of the signature and the note because it doesn't okay so all of those things can be true once it can also be true that this doesn't really change some of the underlying other allegations that people are using this to to dismiss all the allegations all the other allegations are now dismissed because there is this this problem with Beverly young Nelson's credibility now that seems to me overkill as well so with all that I'm trying to give you the most intellectually honest take I can it's a serious problem for her credibility it's a serious problem for Gloria Allred who once again demonstrates to the world that she is terrible at her job and as a hack lawyer and Ana troll but it doesn't do it doesn't do it doesn't carry all the heavy weight that I think a lot of people wanted to carry the weight that says that Roy Moore is now off the hook I think that's that's a little bit that's a little bit of a stretch all all that being said Roy Moore is gonna win there's no question the Roy Moore is gonna win this election now he's gonna win the election by eight to ten points he was already winning the election these charges that started to fade in the public memory and not only in the public memory but in the minds of a lot of conservatives because conservatives have made the concerted effort now the concerted move that they have decided that when so on the initial attack on somebody like Roy Moore is initially over an issue where they agree with Roy Moore then all further attacks will be attributed to malice add motivations and fraud right it's not just with Roy more this is true for Donald Trump too when the initial attacks on Donald Trump were suggestions that his right-wing views made him unpalatable then when there were later suggestions that were of a more personal nature everybody just rocked that up to media animus for Donald Trump the same thing is true of Joe Arpaio Joe Arpaio in Arizona is now apparently considering a run for the Senate he told the daily what are the daily beast that he is seriously seriously seriously considering running for the US Senate to repeal to replace Jeff Flake he'd obviously have an upper hand in the primaries because specifically because of all the media attacks on him because he had to be pardoned by President Trump and that means that a lot of people on the right think that he's a martyr to the cause right that he's somebody who is anti illegal immigration he is somebody who used to dress up his prisoners in pink outfits we like that sort of stuff since we don't like crime and we don't like illegal immigration and the initial media attacks were on that stuff not on corruption in the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office which apparently did exist they paid a 3.5 million dollar settlement to a local newspaper after trying to arrest newspaper reporters for reporting on a subpoena but all of that puts it aside one of the things that unites the sort of feeling for Trump and Roy Moore and and ang RPO is this feeling like if the initial attack on them was over their conservatism or over their right-wing views then all further attacks must be discredited based on the malice of the media and the media doesn't help its own case when it doesn't press Beverly young Nelson for a better explanation of why they didn't come out with this fact earlier why it was weeks before they came out with the fact that the last two lines of this thing at the very least according to Beverly young Nelson were written by Beverly young Nelson so yeah I think that Republicans are being a little disingenuous if they say that all allegations against Joe Arpaio are false because the initial attack on Joe Arpaio was wrong or all the allegations against Roy Moore are false because the initial attack on Roy Moore was wrong over the 10 commandments stuff like the fact is that Roy Moore says a lot of stuff that is inappropriate he says a lot of stuff that is bad but because again I think that you basically have ten seconds in the public eye to make people's minds up about what exactly you are then once their minds been made up it's almost impossible to change them is actually what the social science data tends to suggest then when you walk down the street you make a decision within the first 10 seconds of meeting someone whether you like them or not and it's very difficult to change your opinion the same is true in politics the first impression is the lasting impression that people have about you with regard to politics the first impression about Roy Moore is that he was a very religious guy who took the Ten Commandment seriously and wasn't going to bow to judicial supremacy and that image has basically carried him through all of the credibility questions about him it carries him through with saying ridiculous things right in just a second I'm gonna play you a quote by Roy Moore himself that if any Democrats had at the right would be going nuts but the right doesn't care because anything that is used to attack worry more is now being seen as bad faith here is a little bit of the the tape that I'm talking about Roy Moore was asked by the Guardian about Ronald Reagan once saying that the Russians were the the evil empire and the focus of evil in the modern world and here was Roy Moore's answer he said the Russia was the focus of evil in the modern world you could say that very well by America couldn't you do you think well we promote a lot of bad things you know like same-sex marriage that's the very argument of aladdhin mere Peter makes well then maybe Putin is right maybe he's more kin to me than I know okay so if any Democrat said that right that America's the focus of modern evil in this world and then they cited say not same-sex marriage but but high tea but low taxes and then they said maybe Putin is right we'd lose our minds but Roy Moore says that is totally fine again because people have made up their mind about Roy Moore already the same is true there's a quote apparently and I don't want to put too much stake in this quote I'll read it to you and then I'll tell you why according to the LA Times Roy Moore in September was asked about when he last thought America was great because he's run very much on they make America great again kind of bandwagon and more apparently acknowledged the nation's ugly history of race and racism and then he said I think it was great at the time when families were united even though we had slavery they cared for one another our families were strong our country had a direction so the way the media has run with this is saying that Roy Moore says the last time America was great as when there was slavery I don't think that's what Roy Moore is saying but it's certainly badly our it's another one of these cases where because we just trust the media on the right we want the entire context we don't trust them to tell the truth and this is just another example of why that is so that distrust of the media allows people to take a molehill and make it into a mountain in the case of Beverly young Nelson and all the rest of the accusers it allows them the ability to hang their hat on pegs that are not particularly sturdy again does this call beverly young Nelson herself in a question absolutely does it call Gloria Allred in the question absolutely and I will only follow where the evidence leads when she first came out I said I thought this was very credible I think it's a lot less credible now that that you have this this statement that she wrote in the yearbook herself do I think it completely destroys her credibility no I'm not willing to go that far but it's a problem for her that said for people to say this destroys all of the allegations against Roy Moore is is an overkill that I think is pretty shameless okay before I go any further and I'll talk a little bit about Al Franken first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at us ECA so right now do you remember that gun giveaway I told you about a little bit earlier this week well if you want and you really do have to hurry the US ECA wants to give you for free chances to win a brand-new gun plus all the ammo you

1.com so if you were waiting for the Red Ryder BB gun but now you've upgraded to an actual AR then defend my family now one calm is the place to go go ahead and check that out okay so while the Republicans are having all of this hubbub over more mother more is guilty or innocence and Joe Arpaio and Trent Franks so Trent Franks stepped down yesterday he says he's gonna step down from Congress because two former female staffers are now complaining of sexual harassment apparently franks said that he and his wife have been struggling to get pregnant and that he discussed surrogacy with two women in the workplace and it caused them to stress I'm confused as to why that exactly would be sexual harassment unless he said I want to put a baby in you in which case it is sexual harassment but if it was you work here I trust you seem like a nice gal have you ever considered surrogacy I'm not sure why that sexual harassment per se like I just may be the power melons but that doesn't seem like typical sexual harassment to me so I'm not sure we're getting the entire story on that well all that breaks down on the Republican side the Democrats are preening the Democrats are walking around preening we are just the moral guideposts for the United States we are the most moral of the moral this is the new shtick that Democrats have been trying out on a regular basis yesterday Al Franken did a bad job with it right he he tried to grab the moral high ground but that failed because Al Franken wasn't really willing to acknowledge that he'd done anything wrong here's what Al Franken said yesterday and in saying that he was going to resign now that he did resign yesterday but he would resign in short order if more gets elected and is not thrown out of the Senate I think there's a significant possibility that Franken actually retracts his retirement and says you know what I'm gonna stick around now if the Republicans aren't gonna clean house I'm certainly not gonna leave over this here's what Moore said yesterday Franken said yesterday nevertheless today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate I of all people and aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who is bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with with the full support of his party ok so there he there he does is he also called himself a champion for women and said that the women who are accusing him and gotten it all wrong but he's stepping down anyway it's hard for you to claim the moral high ground when you're blaming the women right I thought the whole shtick here is that women always have to be believed unless you're Al Franken and Franken himself he you know he is his accusers are angry at him and I think for good reason one of the Franken accusers she comes out and she says she's just appalled that Franken won't up to own up to the situation and so is there anything that for you would be justice I I have to say that I I'm so sad and appalled at his lack of response and him owning up to what he did I feel that he just keeps he just keeps passing the buck and making it out to be something that we we took his behavior the wrong way or we misconstrued something it's hard for them to grab the moral high ground in any case while they're busy giving it away but they're trying to grab the moral high ground anyway right they're trying to say that Republicans don't understand the plight of women but we Democrats we understand the plight of women now this is all cynical pandering I mean what they're actually attempting to do is flip the script so they can go after more and Trump right that's the whole goal here is that okay we'll sacrifice one of ours and then we'll use their bodies as a bridge in order to in order to climb the ramparts of Trump and and Roy Moore that's the whole goal here and you see Chris Matthews did the clearest and dumbest version of this so last night on his show he got up younger they show good I might say he talked about Democrats a great people the entire world is just that does fantastic go chasing your thoughts about the possibly positive education that the public hearing I don't know how you can avoid the education in this the worst you can say about the Democrats is they're too pure and that's the good thing to say but that's the worst thing you can say about these guys said to highest standard for public office yeah that's clearly the worst thing you can say about Democrats and their to appear the only pets the only you can say I mean preening just self-aggrandizing stupidity of this nonsense that the only thing Monica Lewinsky's dress disagrees all right the Ted Kennedy's sexual assault victims disagree the worst you can say about Democrats that they're too pure but this is their new routine we have the moral high ground and you can see how cynical this is right Democratic Representative Katherine Kathleen Rice she comes out and she says you know really the guy who should resign here is of course Trump Trump is the one who should really go now although Democrats you know our leadership came to this issue a little late they did call on the resignations that have happened and we need the Republicans to do the same thing we need Paul Ryan to stand up and be the leader of his party I know it's difficult for him to do that when the standard-bearer of the Republican Party for right now is the President of the United States and we know his history with this issue of harassment so my hope and my call is for Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership to get with the program and start forcing people out why shouldn't he resign today like Franken did if you're being consistent said before that he I have said before that he should I don't think that's gonna happen right that's the cynical move the Democrats are making but they're claiming that they have the moral high ground while they're doing it again two things can be true that Franken probably should go and also the Democrats are using this for cynical reasons but the preening is a little much or I mean that the Democrats for claiming themselves on loan from God is pretty astonishing Nancy Pelosi did that as well yesterday she extended it right not only are they Nancy Pelosi was defending Al Franken until five seconds ago and John Conyers until five seconds ago not only does it turn out that the Democrats have a direct pipeline to God when it comes to sexual harassment they also have a direct pipeline to God when it comes to legitimizing the children of illegal immigrants who came here when they were kids we're not going to turn this country into a reign of terror of domestic enforcement look at the jet and have the daca the dreamers pay that price but the I'm optimistic I always have been God is with us on this our country is great we know their greatness Springs from the vitality that newcomers bring to our God is with us you understand they're so holy now don't you see the holiness that they have in getting rid of Al Franken has now translated over to everything including daca and the killing of human babies in the woman till the ninth month it's just amazing how this has happened so before everybody jumps on their high horse and talks about how the Democrats have their holy and now they're they're all wonderful and they're too pure as Chris Matthews says yeah not so much okay so I want to talk a little bit about media malfeasance this is an amazing story so CNN reported this apparent bombshell and they got it totally wrong I'll explain all of it to you in just a second but first I don't say thank you to our sponsor over at men crates so this is one of my favorite sponsors man crates calm it is the best gift that you can get for any man in your family is it great for dads it's

skeptical of the media even on things like Roy Moore you cannot count out the fact that the media are willing to jump over any barrier in order to get Republicans they really are and so when you ask when the left looks at us and they say on the right how could you possibly how could you possibly not just credit the media with great reporting when they report something it's because within three hours half of this stuff gets discredited half is a little much but a certain percentage of gets discredit so for example there was a report from CNN and the report from CNN said that on September 4th there was an email that was sent to the Trump administration - Donald J Trump - channel 2 Donald Trump jr. - other members of the administration and that this email had a key code a decryption key for WikiLeaks that had not yet been released publicly as a big scandal if it turns out then that's one step removed from actual collusion right if it turns out that the WikiLeaks people at the behest of the Russian government send a decryption key the Trump administration the Trump campaign and that the Trump campaign used it in order to go in and spy on Hillary Clinton's emails before those things were released publicly that would look a lot like collusion would it not it turns out every elements of the stories bullcrap every single one so first of all the email was not sent on September 4th before the wiki leaks were leaked it was sent on September 14th after they were all are in public information you didn't need a decryption key for public information number two there's no evidence that Donald Trump jr. or Donald Trump ever saw this email number three there's no evidence that the email itself is legit that it didn't just come from some spammer so the way that this originally was run the way the original headline was run was something like I want to I want to find if I can the actual headline CNN report Trump and Trump jr. got September 2016 email with decryption key right here's what David Wright from CNN tweeted he tweeted candidate Donald Trump Donald Trump jr. and others in the Trump org received email in September 2016 offering a decryption key and website address for hacked WikiLeaks documents according to email provided to congressional investigators write bombshell before any of this was public they were being offered a special in by WikiLeaks aka the Russian government except again it turns out it may not have come from the Russian government there's no evidence Trump looked at it and the email came ten days after the initial CNN report said which means that the email came out after all the information was public I mean this is a Brian Ross level screw-up it is a massive massive screw-up somebody needs to get suspended for it at the very least because to misreport in that from Attica fashion does a disservice to the Trump administration then you wonder why Trump runs around shouting fake news you wonder why Republicans distrust reporting from places like the Washington Post you wonder why Republicans have now come to the conclusion then nothing can be trusted part of it is because they're taking the message too far but part of it is because there is a grain of truth which is that a lot of the media are willing to jump on stories that have not been vetted and are not true in order to promulgate a particular narrative and this is just the best example of that Democrats are doing this too representative hooli and Castro who has presidential aspirations he comes out and he says that don't worry even though there really is no hard information connecting trump and russia at this point disturbing things will definitely come out I mean come on well as you know I can't discuss most of that stuff now but you know I told you months ago and when I said it back then I think it was considered a little bit brash but I said I think in April that I thought that there would be people who would end up in jail and and as I stand here now I think that there gonna be some things that come out that will be very surprising and disturbing right they just want to read the chyron right this is earlier this was earlier yesterday and says CNN exclusive undisclosed email show follow-up after Don jr. meeting with Russians at Trump Tower but the follow-up didn't actually have anything bad to that either there's no evidence that any follow-up was even responded to by the Trump people so everything that CNN is reporting and when you watch CNN half their coverage is about Russia stuff there not only is there no smoking gun there is no bullet there's no gun like we I don't even know what these stories are supposed to be proving when they're this bad and then they and then again it's amazing to me people are wondering how could it possibly be how can it possibly be that people don't trust the mainstream media this is why people don't trust the mainstream media seriously okay I mean wow there's more fallout over the Jerusalem situation so Donald Trump I have to give him credit for this tweet this tweet he gets credit for it he moved the he says he's gonna move the embassy to Jerusalem acknowledges Jerusalem is the capital of Israel as I've said initiate a move of moral bravery and courage and he released this tweet which is I have to say pretty funny he tweeted out above this I fulfilled my campaign promise others didn't full credit to trump this is exactly true now there's a lot of violence that has been breaking out around the world there are clashes in in Judea Samaria and the Gaza Strip Hamas of course calling for an uprising because they're a terrorist group that's what they do one Palestinian protesters been shot dead but to be frank with you the levels of terror that I've seen so far the levels of violence that I've seen so far have been relatively innocuous so they say that their rallies in Malaysia Indonesia Iran Syria and even America ooh I mean people in Syria are angry oh noes you mean people in Iran are upset well I guess that changes everything because Iran was our best friend before you mean Muslims in Malaysia are very upset about things well unless people are actually like getting hurt or killed I don't really see so what their protest big big freaking deal they protest over if you if you said tomorrow we're gonna have a Day of Rage well we'll call it the Nakba right the day that Israel was established the Palestinians called the knock by the disaster will have a day of rage on that day you don't the same people protesting there's nothing to it Jerusalem it has to do it the fact they hate Israel it's that simple so Thursday apparently there were 16 Palestinians wounded they said that most of the injuries were from tear gas and rubber bullets and and of course you have all of the all the usual leftist suspects saying this is going to be the end of the world it won't be the end of the world Trump was right to do it I do want to point out how the media have exacerbated the situation so Richard angle the media like to embed in the Middle East in in places like Gaza and then they just stand around with cameras and watch people burn their own towns and then they treat it as though something heroic is taking place this is in Ramallah Ramallah is completely run by the Palestinian Authority the Israelis do not run Ramallah and Richard Engel over on NBC here as here's him reporting good morning as you can probably see clashes and civil unrest have broken out here in the West Bank we are on the outskirts of the Palestinian city of Ramallah these protesters have begun setting fires they're burning tires to create a smoke screen and they are throwing stones and other debris it's difficult to see but behind this smoke our Israeli troops and they have been firing volleys of tear gas occasionally to drive the demonstrators back all these protesters say they are here for one reason because Palestinians they say will not give up on their right to Jerusalem no matter what President Trump says okay well the me look at the excitement from Richard Engel you can see the media are really turned on about all of this what would happen let me just pose something what would happen if the media minimized the coverage in the same way that the media minimize the coverage of serial killers but this seems to me very much like the coverage of the riots in Ferguson or the riots in Baltimore the media love the stuff and they egg it on and then they're surprised when violence breaks out that doesn't wash it doesn't wash at all okay so in other news now there are a couple of stories that are kind of astonishing today so one is with regard to yours truly so apparently I was supposed to speak at Concordia College Concordia College in Moorhead at things in New Hampshire and they had funded it the Student Government Association had voted to fund it in November 30th they voted 13 to 10 to allocate about $7,000 to young America's for freedom to fund one of my appearances and now student leaders voted 28 to 2 against funding it so they would through the funding more than 150 students and faculty filled Barre auditorium for an hour-long discussion leading up to the vote that nullified a previous decision to have me and the SGA sent an executive email said SGA's first goal is to listen to represent and act on the feedback of its students and there will be a motion put forward to rescind the funding you're welcome to add to the discussion during the meeting some concordia students according to the motion to rescind funding have a sort of that Shapiro's harmful messages targeting LGBTQ qya Elzey communities and other marginalized identities is in direct opposition to the dedication of Concordia and SGA to support diversity equity and inclusion of all persons from all backgrounds and identities so this was an appeasement move it's pretty astonishing and and pretty obvious young Americans for freedom at Concordia they said bringing ben shapiro to campus would be assigned from Concordia College that they value intellectual and political diversity and that they care about the marginalized and underrepresented conserved underrepresented conservative voices on campus but they're not gonna do it they've decided that it's not about diversity instead it's mostly about shutting down people who you don't like it's shutting down folks that you don't like which of course we already knew from my experiences on college campuses before speaking of free speech concerns isn't a formal free speech concern because I believe Concordia is a private college they can do whatever they want it does demonstrate that they're supposed to commitment to free speech however is a joke but you know in terms of social Center for unpopular opinions that are true this is an astonishingly bad story so there's a woman who's a porn star or was a porn star her name was August Ames and she's 23 she was found dead from an apparent suicide she was bullied and branded a homophobe for refusing to shoot with a man who has sex with men on camera she made it clear she was not homophobic apparently she's bisexual or was bisexual but she said that she wasn't gonna do it for safety reasons so law enforcement sources said that Ames was found early Tuesday morning in Camarillo she was pronounced dead at the scene we're told there's no indication of foul play or any other crime occurring toxicology tests are being conducted while the death is investigated close friends say she'd suffer from long-term depression and they believe a recent incident with online harassment may have contributed to her death the backlash was fierce when she took to Twitter on Sunday to warn women who had been tapped to replace her at erotica acts that the man she'd be worked that she'd be working with has filmed with other men so whichever lady performers replacing me tomorrow for erotica X news you're shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn just to let you know BS is all I can say do agents really not care about who they're representing I do my homework for my body she was ridiculed as homophobic she wrote not homophobic most girls don't shoot with guys who shot gay porn for safety that's just how it is with me I'm not putting my body at risk I don't know what they do in their private lives she says how am i homophobic if I myself am attracted to women not wanting to have sex with gay men is not homophobic they don't want to have sex with me either so by okay that seems to me completely fair but the point that she's making here is a statistically true one okay the rates of STDs in among men who have sex with men are significantly higher than they are among men who have sex with women right STDs among men who have sex with men are much much higher they just are and the idea that a homosexual man or a man who has had sex with men was is is going to sex the woman it increases her risk it increases her ass pretty dramatically actually I'm looking up some of the statistics if I can find them from from some of the more recent CDC statistics so let's say less able to find something really quick here so gay bisexual and other men who have had to this front corn CDC gay bisexual other men who have had sex with men are 17 times more likely to get anal cancer than heterosexual men gay and bisexual men are significantly more likely to have other forms of STDs CDC recommends sexually active gay and bisexual men test for HIV at least once a year hepatitis C hepatitis B gonorrhea medea right the rates are jet that they're higher because they're higher I mean there's there's nothing else to say about that and so the idea that this woman was basically run off Twitter and then she committed suicide over this it demonstrates the insanity of the social censoring that goes on on social media like Twitter people digging up tweets that are ten years old or finding a tweet these said yesterday that's completely innocuous and then taking it out of context in order to hurt you it's it's over it's it's just overboard it's all overboard and people need to rein it in there's a digital lynch mob that exists now and it's pretty scary out there okay so I do want to get two things I like things I hate and the mail bag will do a nice mail bag today but for that you're gonna have to go over to Daley wire.com and

want to be a part of we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty so let's do a quick thing I like in a quick thing that I hate and then we will move to the mailbag so things I like today I should have a couple of things that I like today so watching all this hubbub over particularly crappy candidates on both sides of the aisle makes it reminds me of movie called the best man this is not a well remembered movie that's Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson Edie Adams very good cast the movie was written by gore Vidal so it is a left-leaning movie but the basic plot of it is that Henry Fonda is a former Secretary of State based on Adlai Stevenson who's supposed to be running for president and Cliff Robertson is supposed to be based on Richard Nixon he's running for president - cliff Robertson's the bad guy Henry Fonda's the good guy and basically they are the two leading candidates for president battling it out the question is who's gonna win and what sort of dirty tricks they'll use it an open convention in order to win it's entertaining it's definitely entertaining and it doesn't say something about about you know what what lengths people are willing to go to for power this is Secretary of State William Russell candidate for president of the United States is he the best man you have no sense of responsibility toward anybody or anything and that is a tragedy and a man and it is a disaster and a president this is Senator Joe Cantwell candidate for president of the United States is he the best man you don't understand politics you don't understand this country this is art hochstätter former president of the United States will he back the best man power is not a toy that we give the good children it's a weapon and the strong man takes it and he uses it to get here some men will stop at nothing the film itself is it's very entertaining and it's all about sort of the manipulations behind the scenes it's it's definitely a a strained movie in the sense that a bunch of sort of wild coincidences happen at the same time and and there's a lot of scandal going on it's an exaggeration of reality but it's a it's a fun movie to watch and the acting is quite good Cliff Robertson particularly gives a very good performance in it okay other things that I like so Believe It or Not DeRay McKesson tweeted something out that I liked yesterday it was not anything of contents or significance but it was very funny back in 1996 Patti LaBelle sang for Christmas and Patti LaBelle and Patti LaBelle was singing some song that I don't know she didn't know the song either is the biggest is the bigger problem so here's a little bit the video of Patti LaBelle singing and she realizes that she actually does not know any of the words that she's about to sing okay so you watching the whole that goes on for two minutes like this it's pretty amazing so thank you patti labelle for giving us all a spot of cheer in a dark time okay time for a quick thing that I hate and then we'll get to the mailbag alrighty so thing that I hate today there's this tweet that was going around yesterday that's just nuts it's from a family a feminist of course so I needed I didn't even need to tell you that it was kind of crazy uh her she calls herself mrs. Claus and here's what you tweeted listen guys let me clarify something for you when women's spaces say men are welcome that's not true we're just scared to tell you no so just to be clear no means no but yes also means no so everything means no unless yes means yes but it probably means no because you're scared if you're wondering why men may be slightly confused about what the standards of behavior ought to be it's folks like mrs. Claus who are not making things any easier here okay time for the mailbag so let's start with Robert Robert says Ben what is your view on mandatory drug testing for welfare recipients the answer is yes good stuff the reason that you should have mandatory drug testing for welfare recipients is because there should be some strings attached if the idea on welfare is to get you back to work we don't want you drugging out in your free time and then going and getting my taxpayer dollars to sponsor your drug habit Matthew says hey Ben knowing that Trump has declared Jerusalem to be Israel's capital and promised to move the embassy do you regret not voting from last year we consider voting from for reelection i personally feel out switch my vote to him so as far as regretting my vote I could only base my vote on the evidence that was in evidence at the time so I've said where I think that I was wrong about Trump right I thought that I was wrong about him on Gorsuch I think he's governed much more conservative than the evidence suggested that he was going to to that point I didn't think he was gonna do it he just stayed on Jerusalem he did it and I've given him I think more than full points on that as far as what I consider voting from next time sure I'd consider voting for him next time you know I'll look at the options that come up and we'll see where we are in three years but yeah of course I'd consider voting form next time I considered voting from last time so you know I think that you can only make your decision based on the evidence that was at hand at the time but he has exceeded my expectations in a variety of ways and summer he is not and I've been clear on that as well Joseph says hi then I believe from a theological and historical perspective Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel but how do I argue against those who contain that contend that after 70 AD the Jews were evicted through military means and thus lost their claim to the land could the Mexicans or Native Americans make the same historical and ancestral claims about the southwestern United States well the answer is no the reason being because even after the expulsion of Jews in 70 AD Jews had a continuous presence in the land and there was never an independent state of Palestine that existed outside of Jewish rule it was always part of a broader Empire it was never an actual state or land that was run by an independent conglomerate of people that just never happened so the the longest-lasting group of people it's more like a native Reservation than it would be like anything else in the sense that Jews were always there and maintained a presence there and again if you look at the original Native American treaties in the United States before the Trail of Tears in the attempt to force Indians off their land Native Americans off there I think there's a good case that those people should know how to stay on their land Heather says hi Ben I'm a big fan I greatly respect your values politically and personally my question is religiously based I'm a critical-care registered nurse I've had some emotionally taxing events at work recently I've never considered myself a religious person lately I've felt a desire for spiritual guidance I do not belong to a church nor does my family you have any advice on how I should begin well I think that you have to decide whether what you're looking for is a community experience you're just looking for a comforting religious thought or deep religious thought I think that good beginning religious thought is CS Lewis I like a lot of CS Lewis's work you should go check out his religious thought I've recommended many of his books including the abolition of man and and mere christianity i my show of momiji oh i think there's a lot mira christian and they particularly the first third before he gets to the super christian part that I agree with and so that is that is worth checking out as far as the community that you're looking for I would check out some churches see where you feel welcome see where you feel like you find people who are thinking along the same lines if you have questions does the pastor or a preacher some more or priest somebody who is ins answering those questions in a fair and honest fashion morgan's has been how did you know you wanted to marry your wife and how long did it take for you to propose I knew I wanted to marry her for a couple of reasons so I think that here is the typical pathway for men deciding they want to get married first there has to be physical attraction okay this is just the reality when men our first attracted to a woman it's because there's a physical attraction of the woman so my wife happens to be smoking hot so this definitely was the was the initial draw but the in the first date I mean I dated a lot of women one time and decided in one day anymore because they were not either intellectually stimulating or have the same values she not only there was more than just a spark there's what I'm saying it's easy to find I think a certain level of chemistry particularly sexual chemistry with people I don't think that's the hardest thing in the world to find what is hard to find as somebody who shares your values and my wife and I on our first date for three hours discussed free will and determinism and how many kids we each wanted to have I mean we're dating for marriage and so you have to do I'm not saying it saying sit there with a checklist but you do have to have a group of things in your head that you want out of a spouse and I don't mean like they're going to you know shine your shoes or make dinner for you I mean things like what kind of life do they want to build and what kind of values do they hold dear because that's the stuff you're gonna be able to build a future on Jonathan height has a chapter in the happiness hypothesis about love and one of the things he points out is that when you first meet your potential mate then the level of passion and passionate love is an equals a passionate love and companionate love compassionate love is like here on the scale and companionate love meaning how well you know the person how much you love them for who they are as a companion is down here and this falls off from in about six months passionate love falls off within six months or a year a couple of years the most it doesn't mean that doesn't exist anymore but it just is different okay I can tell you as somebody's in married for ten years the feeling that you have for your spouse particularly kind of the kind of fiery need that you have for your spouse at the very beginning is not the same is not the same burning need that you have for your spouse throughout your life and the companion to love tends to rise so passionate love declines companionate love Rises that's the way it should happen because companion at love is more important when you're building a life and building a family who you want to have sex with is a pretty arbitrary decision to a certain extent okay so Tanner says hi Ben I have a quick question my older brother got a girl pregnant he has only been dating for maybe a month and a half does not know what to do he wants to settle down and get married with the girl take responsibility for the kid she's unwilling to get married and take responsibility for the kid she wants to put the kid up for adoption with my brother which my brother does not want to do I want to give him some helpful advice what should he do well here's my feeling if he if she's not gonna take care of the kid and he is not going to get married and adopt the kid and have a spouse adopt the kid or if your parents are not available to adopt the children children need a mother and a father a single father is not a good solution a single mother is not a good solution if those are the only two solutions on the table put the kid up for adoption put them in a loving two-parent family it would be a benefit to the child you know the best outcome is biological mother and father bringing up child on average not for every family but on average but it is more important that the child grew up in a two-parent family a solid two-parent family than that your brother be with his own child there being an active ferment of self-sacrifice by a brother actually I think to to put the child in the best of living scenario unless your parents are willing to adopt the kids the kid Joseph says do you think Trump's become more conservative since his first day in office why are why not it's hard for me to say whether Trump himself has become more conservative I will say that his policy has become more conservative his policy in the last week and a half last two weeks has been as conservative as anything I've ever seen more conservative than then I would say the Reagan administration the last couple of weeks but as far as him personally I never get into the business of reading what's going on in Donald Trump's head because I think that that's a risky business Jenna says heaven after years of morning's learned the violin I finally coughed up the money about my first violin I've been taking lessons for a few months now but I'm curious as to what advice would be when learning to play what is the most important thing to remember when playing well I mean it differs based on your skill level so when you become as good as I am when you've been playing for 15 years and you better be good at that point or quit when it when you've played I've been playing since I was five years old so what you're thinking about then is making sure that there's musicality to what you're playing you're actually thinking about what you want things to sound like when you're at beginning stages it is really practice practice practice make sure that all the muscle memory is in place metronome is your friend people tend to lose tempo intonation is your friend if you have somebody who can play the piano with you that would definitely help because otherwise you ends up with a sort of bizarre relative pitch Tyler says what individual in American history has caused the most damage to the country this is a good question there there there there are many individuals who caused tremendous damage to the country I would say there's a very solid case for well I mean slave holders I would put Woodrow Wilson up there I would put FDR up there I would put LBJ up there there number of demagogues who I think have driven public opinion the wrong direction it's hard to name one person but though I would say that the leggo the legacy of slavery continues to continues to cruelly divide our politics even though we all agree that slavery is bad now Danny says I'm a cradle Catholic I take my faith extremely seriously however in the past few years I've felt extremely drawn to Judaism which is where my own Christian faith has roots the subtraction is growing ever stronger even through my own research and also because of your inspiration I wonder what your opinion was on Christians celebrating Hanukkah and Pesach so the halacha pinion is the christians the kind of the Jewish law pinion is the Christians shouldn't celebrate these things I will you know add a bit of heresy here I think that is fine for Christians to celebrate these things I think anything that connects you to the god of the judeo-christian by a religion is a good thing and Jesus celebrated Passover so I don't really see the the problem with this per se so the the in fact my family has invited non-jews over to Passover for years and for Hanukkah parties so if you want to go for it go for it whatever whatever makes you feel closer to God Christoph says then I believe your understanding of abortion be somewhat flawed or at least there's one part of your position you've not been clear about this pertains when you define life to begin to introduce what I mean let me pose a very practical question and one very applicable to go 200 couples that want to have children for having difficulty doing so do you support in vitro fertilization this procedure always results in the destruction of several embryos our couples that pursue this method of fertility killing humans in the process so they are ending a human potential incipient human life IVF I have always said that if you have the money to use every fertilized egg that's how IVF should be performed and in fact I've said this and there's a member of my synagogue who his wife had gotten in vitro and she had frozen the leftover egg and they were gonna throw it away and his wife said I don't think that that's moral they implanted the egg and they had a baby and this baby is now their child I think that every every fertilized egg ought to be treated with the respect due to at the very least potential human life and so if you're going to treat in vitro in the most moral possible way you creates fertilized eggs just for destruction instead you implant the number of fertilized eggs that you're willing to bear to fruition Michaels has been what is your thought on the amount of money we spend on the military we spend it's less about amount than what we spend the military money on and in some cases we're spending it on frivolous nonsense weapon systems we don't need and all that but I don't really have a problem with us spending an enormous amount of money on the military I think it's one of the only decent functions of the government let's see Nicholas says howdy Ben what are your thoughts on the Rockefeller Carnegie and Vanderbilt monopolies also deal well we're going back to like 1880 here this is great what do you think the government do you think the government is right to break up the Standard Oil Trust and should the government have broken up other monopolies so I think that the government was not right to break up the trust I think a lot of trust busting was based on a fallacious assumption about how monopolies actually operated a lot of those monopolies were not actual monopolies and I think that a lot of the trust-busting was basic class warfare that was taking place at the time to speak to specific trusts I would actually do a little more research on that so I will do that let's see okay final one Philip says as a small limited government proponent what suggestions would you have to rationalize my desire to fund NASA two historic highs and literally shoot for the stars on outer space science exploration I get the low Earth orbit launches and deliveries to the ISS are best suited to private entities but there seems to be very little motivation or reward for private entity like SpaceX to explore for the sake of exploration well I think you'd have to talk about - Elon Musk about that because I believe that Elon Musk has actually talked about doing deep-space exploration i if it's privately fund about I think I'd be great the only purpose for actual government funding of deep deep space exploration would be for defense purposes or for the possibility of creating you know new cures to disease or something you know creating new inventions but as a general rule I think that NASA funding non-connected - defense is a mistake and should be best left in private hands I do think private funding will fill in the gaps there I mean as SpaceX is showing okay so we will be back
