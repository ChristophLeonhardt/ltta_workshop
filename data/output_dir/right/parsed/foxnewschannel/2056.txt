>> IN THE STREETS SAYING DEATH
TO AMERICA.
I SAID WHO SIGNS A DEAL WHEN
THEY'RE MARCHING SAYING, DEATH
TO AMERICA?
BRIAN: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
DEADLINE TO DECIDE THE FATE OF
IRANIAN DEAL JUST DAYS AWAY, MAY
12th.
OUR NEXT GUEST WHO IS MEETING
THE VICE PRESIDENT TODAY ON THE
VERY ISSUE WARNS IT OFFERS THE
FEWEST DISADVANTAGES.
ONLY IRAN BENEFITS BY
WITHDRAWING.
HERE TO EXPLAIN BRITISH FOREIGN
SECRETARY BORIS JOHNSON.
MR. SECRETARY, MAKE YOUR CASE BY
STAYING IN THIS DEAL, THAT YOU
EVEN TOLD US IS FLAWED.
>> IT IS.
OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT
TO SEE FLAWS IN IT.
HE SET A VERY REASONABLE
CHALLENGE TO THE WORLD.
LOOK, IRAN IS BEHAVING BADLY.
IRAN HAS A TENDENCY TO DEVELOP
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC
MISSILES.
WE HAVE TO PUSH BACK WHAT IRAN
IS DOING IN THE REGION.
WE HAVE TO BE TOUGHER ON IRAN.
WE HAVE TO FIX THE FLAWS IN THE
DEAL.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS
THIS SUNSET CLAUSE WHICH MEANS
THAT AFTER 2025 IT ALLOWS, THE
CURRENT DEAL ALLOWS TO GO
FORWARD FAST WITH ENRICHMENT
PROGRAMS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A
NUCLEAR WEAPON.
NOW, NO SANCTIONS GO BACK ON.
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY OF FIXING
THAT AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
RIGHT TO CALL ATTENTION TO IT.
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT
JUST THROWING THE BABY OUT WITH
THE BATH WATER.
WITHOUT SCRAPPING THE WHOLE
THING.
IF YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE TO
ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHAT NEXT?
WHAT IF THE IRANIANS RUSH TO A
NUCLEAR WEAPON?
ARE WE SERIOUSLY SAYING THAT
WE'LL BOMB THE FACILITIES AT
FORDA AND NATANZ?
OR WE WORK WITH WHAT WE GOT AND
PUSH BACK.
BRIAN: CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMS
SERVICES COMMITTEE AGREES WITH
YOU.
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE DEAL BUT
WHAT REPLACES IT.
ARE YOU PROPOSING TAKE 60 DAYS,
MR. PRESIDENT, HOLD ON THE
EUROPEAN LEADERS WILL COME
TOGETHER WITH YOUR CONCERNS AND
PUT AN OVERLAY ON IT?
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS, IRAN
DOES NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING.
IRAN SIGHS I'M STICKING STICKIN
IRAN SIGHS I'M STICKING STICKINI
IRAN SIGHS I'M STICKING STICKINH
THIS DEAL.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A NEW
DEAL.
>> THAT IS RIGHT.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.
SO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, YOU'VE
GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE HEART
OF THE OLD DEAL, THE EXISTING
DEAL IS THAT IT GIVES IRAN SOME
REASON TO HOPE THAT THEY WILL
HAVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN THE
LONG RUN.
ACTUALLY THEY HAVEN'T HAD MUCH
IN THE LAST FEW YEAR.
IN RETURN FOR WHICH THEY DON'T
EQUIP THEMSELVES WITH A NUCLEAR
WEAPON.
LET ME JUST REMIND YOU IF THEY
DO GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON YOU WILL
GET AN ARMS RACE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
YOU WILL HAVE THE SAUDIS WANTING
ONE, THE EGYPTIANS, EMIRATIS
