a debate has started among members of Congress as to whether or not Donald Trump should or needs to seek congressional approval to do a preemptive strike on North Korea now thankfully there are Republican members of Congress who are speaking up and saying that congressional approval is absolutely necessary senator Dan Sullivan who's a Republican from Alaska and who sits on the Armed Services Committee and comes from a state North Korea claims is within range of its missile said pre-emptive war on the Korean Peninsula would require authorization of Congress he continues to say that article 1 of the US Constitution is very clear about that we also have another Republican who says I think it would be to the president's advantage to consult with Congress it lets North Korea know we mean business that's representative Daniel Webster from Florida of course there are Democrats who would definitely prefer congressional approval let's hear from one of them we know that the president is suggesting potential use of military force this is a conversation that needs to take place representative dan Kildee from Michigan and so the list goes on and on and I'm glad that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are now speaking up about this because there is a potential preemptive strike against North Korea based on some of the rhetoric that we've heard from Donald Trump but I also want to note that even though our law indicates that they're supposed to get congressional approval there have been lawmakers on the Left who have violated that so in 1973 there was the War Powers Act that essentially says gives the president the power to wage war for 60 days before an authorization from Congress is needed after that if Congress says no or if they don't get congressional approval they have about an additional 30 days to withdraw troops and Bill Clinton you know did the bombing in Kosovo without congressional approval also there was the case involving Barack Obama and his military actions in Libya okay so usually both parties are enormous ly hypocritical about this and depending on who's in office they'll just say oh yeah total power if it's the president from their party and and if it's not they'll say all the president has no power to do that it's outrageous and then read the Constitution so what's the reality yeah so I think that even the War Powers Act of 1973 is unconstitutional because it clearly says the Constitution that Congress has to declare war so now we've made all sorts of nonsense compromises that have nothing doing what's right in the Constitution if you're a judicial conservative and you believe in strict interpretation all this should be clearly obviously out of bounds and and very quickly remember after 9/11 Congress essentially allowed presidents to go after terrorism without congressional approval so that kind of opened the floodgates for more power concentrated in the executive branch so I want to get back to that in one quick second but so dropping a bomb on a country even if it's not against the government of that country there is no such exception in the Constitution they there's no exception for drone strikes signature strikes only air wars against Libya there's no exceptions for any of this and there's certainly not an exemption for nuclear war which is as war as war gets so going to Anna's point about the 2001 authorization for the President to act against the global war on terror which is way too broad Barbara Lee did a wonderful thing she's a very progressive member of Congress and she if she sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee and she suggested that that authorization be taken away because it was from 16 years ago and it's too broad and guess what it passed the committee and that's great that's amazing and then of course Republican leaders came in and killed it and took it out of the bill that they were considering so that's again the Republicans being hypocrites at the leadership level but to be fair to the Republicans here finally we are beginning to break some partisan ranks and and in the case in this case it's the Republicans who deserve credit with a Republican president sitting in office some of them not most of them but some of them are beginning to say maybe we should go back to what the Constitution says obviously partly because they can see Trump too they have eyes right they see him as a rational actor I think that's the reason why they're speaking up and they realize what's at stake yes so they realize how erratic he is and they're worried that he might actually start a nuclear war which would be unbelievable even a representative atom Kissinger Republican of Illinois trying to support Trump had to admit that he the words he use against North Korea were quote silly words and that he wouldn't have said them then and he hopes that the president can find a smart way of saying it good luck with that approach and finally representative ted Lieu Democrat of California and Ed Markey Democrat of Massachusetts who's a senator wrote companion bills saying that Trump should not have the authority to launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks before Congress declares war now that to me is the most reasonable thing in the world you shouldn't even have to pass that bill it's already in the Constitution but it's great to clarify and of course the Republicans overall the majority of them said hell no so well that now sends a message to Trump despite some breaking in the ranks the Republican Congress says if you want to do preemptive nuclear war it's still okay by them it's crazy help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
