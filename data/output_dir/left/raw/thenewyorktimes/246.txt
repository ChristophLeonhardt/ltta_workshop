00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,370
The YouTube shooter,
Nasim Aghdam,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,600
was widely known on 
Iranian social media

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,270
as Nasim Sabz, which 
means “Green Nasim,”

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,730
because of her advocacy for 
animal rights, healthy living

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,130
and veganism.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,250
Her specific style of videos
made her relatively

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,430
famous among Iran’s growing
YouTube and Instagram influencers.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,320
For instance, one showing
a rabbit where she explains

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,870
the differences
between vegetarianism

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,870
and being vegan.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,700
In another video, 
she explains the benefits

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,280
of eating a papaya.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,610
One of her most
well-known videos here

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,010
is one where she’s
wearing a revealing purple dress.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,080
Don’t believe what
you see, is a message

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,730
appearing in the video screen.

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,810
“I’m being discriminated,
and filtered on YouTube,

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,470
and I’m not the only one.”

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,490
“And if you go and
check my videos,

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,510
you see that my
new videos hardly get views.”

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,150
She also criticizes YouTube,
and makes a physical protest,

22
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,870
a year ago, by going on the
streets, posting what she claims

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,770
to be a picture of herself
holding up a sign saying,

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,050
“YouTube dictatorship.”

25
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,270
And then there is a video that
gives more insight, if you will,

26
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,390
into the life of Ms. Aghdam.

27
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,540
She had fled her native
Iran decades ago.

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,930
In that video, she explains
that even though

29
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,250
she was a member of
the Baha'i faith,

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,410
which is a persecuted
faith in Iran,

31
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,280
she doesn’t really like
life in the United States.

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,540
And she literally says: 
In Iran they kill you by axe.

33
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,440
But in the United States 
they kill you with cotton,

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,150
an Iranian expression
for saying that she is

35
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,570
dying a slow death
in the United States.

36
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,500
She was also repeatedly being
teased online for her comments.

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,710
Many Iranian users
in social media

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,290
would ridicule her, would
tell her that she’s crazy.

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,850
And in one video she
actually explains

40
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,166
that she's doing very well,

41
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,540
and that it's actually the people

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,400
who are making those comments
who are mentally ill.

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,450
She also criticizes Instagram,
by saying that her followers

44
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,390
are all real.

45
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,970
She actually has several
Instagram accounts.

46
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,020
She also had a Telegram channel.

47
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,140
Before she attacked 
the YouTube office,

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,220
and subsequently
killed herself,

49
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,200
one of her last posts there 
is a childhood photo of herself

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:00:00,000
posing between flowers,
with one flower stuck in her hair.
