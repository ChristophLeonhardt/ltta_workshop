00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,803
>> Tucker: HILLARY CLINTON

2
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:11,471
FAILED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

3
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:12,572
TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE HAS BEEN

4
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:13,940
DETERMINED TO REMAIN IN THE

5
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:15,675
PUBLIC EYE EVER SINCE.

6
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:17,343
NOW THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

7
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:18,811
EDITORIAL BOARD IS FED UP WITH

8
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:21,180
IT IN AN OPINION PIECE.

9
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:24,250
BOARD MEMBER MICHELLE COTTLE

10
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:28,621
COMPLAINS ABOUT CLINTON MASTER

11
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:29,956
CLASS.

12
00:00:29,957 --> 00:00:32,358
AND SHE CLAIMS SHA SHE IS

13
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,960
DELUDING THE PARTY MESSAGE.

14
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,429
IN SHORT, HILLARY PLEASE GO

15
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:36,763
AWAY.

16
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:40,032
AND DAVE RUBEN HOST OF "RUBEN

17
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,367
REPORT" AND JOINS US TONIGHT.

18
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:42,335
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

19
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:43,169
>> GREAT TO SEE YOU.

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,036
>> Tucker: ONE OF THE

21
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:45,204
BENEFIT TO BEING IN LOS

22
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,072
ANGELES BECAUSE YOU ARE ON THE

23
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:46,372
SET.

24
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:49,709
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HILLARY

25
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,076
CLINTON?

26
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:51,511
SHE STILL IS THE STANDARD

27
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:53,112
BEARER OF THE PARTY, ISN'T

28
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:53,479
SHE?

29
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,680
THE LAST NOMINEE.

30
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:55,982
>> THE LINE ABOUT THE CIVILITY

31
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:57,383
WE CAN NO LONGER BE CIVIL WITH

32
00:00:57,384 --> 00:00:58,384
THE POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

33
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:00,686
THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS.

34
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:01,487
WORD IT DIFFERENTLY.

35
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:02,855
WE SHOULD BE UNCIVIL?

36
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:09,862
THAT IS WHAT SHE IS SAYING.

37
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,665
HUNT THEM DOWN IN ELEVATORS GO

38
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,133
TO THEIR JOB, STOP THEM ON THE

39
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:14,434
ROAD?

40
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:15,334
WHERE DOES IT GO?

41
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:17,303
WHAT WE HAVE IS WE CAN DO THIS

42
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:20,173
EVERY NIGHT, YOU, TUCKER, CAN

43
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,507
ARGUE WITH SOMEONE ABOUT

44
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:22,108
SOMETHING POLITICAL.

45
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:23,075
IT DOESN'T GET VIOLENT.

46
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:24,510
YOU WRAP IT UP AT THE END OF

47
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:24,877
THE DAY.

48
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,179
YOU GO HOME AND DO IT AGAIN

49
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,979
THE NEXT DAY.

50
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,181
CIVILITY IS ALL WE HAVE.

51
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:31,784
THEY ARE MAKING IT VERY CLEAR.

52
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:33,486
THIS IS SOMEONE ON THE LEFT MY

53
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:33,886
WHOLE LIFE.

54
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:36,489
I NEVER VOTED -- ONE TIME IN

55
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,058
MY LIFE I VOTED FOR A

56
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:40,693
REPUBLICAN, MIKE BLOOMBERG IN

57
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:42,161
HIS THIRD TERM IN NEW YORK

58
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:43,262
CITY LONG TIME AGO.

59
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:45,965
HAZY REPUBLICAN SITUATION.

60
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,266
I SAY THIS AS SOMEONE TRYING

61
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,734
TO CALL IT OUT AS I CONSIDER

62
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:52,071
MY SIDE FOR A LONG TIME.

63
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:58,744
GUYS, LET'S REIN IT BACK IN.

64
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,346
THIS IS DANGEROUS.

65
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:01,547
>> Tucker: I WONDER IF SHE

66
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:01,948
DOES.

67
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:03,216
>> I THINK THEY REALIZE THEY

68
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:04,250
LOST CONTROL OF THE PARTY.

69
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:05,785
THE CLINTON MACHINE DOESN'T

70
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:06,853
HAVE CONTROL OF THE PARTY.

71
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:08,387
AND THE PARTY IS GOING THROUGH

72
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:09,956
A DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST OR THE

73
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:10,523
SOCIALIST DEMOCRAT.

74
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:12,592
WHATEVER THEY WILL DROP THE

75
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:13,960
DEMOCRAT PAR SOON ENOUGH.

76
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:20,900
SHE IS TRYING TO GRAB TO MAKE

77
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:21,701
HER FEEL RELEVANT.

78
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:23,135
IN A WEIRD WAY SHE HAS TO GET

79
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,303
OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE OTHER

80
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:25,004
THING TO TAKE OVER.

81
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,305
NOT THAT I THINK THE OTHER

82
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:27,006
THING IS GREAT.

83
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,008
BUT I THINK THE OTHER THING,

84
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,977
THE MORE FAR LEFT WING OF THE

85
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,011
PARTY IS MUCH WORSE.

86
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:33,145
>> I WOULD TAKE HILLARY

87
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:34,280
CLINTON ANY DAY OVER SOME OF

88
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,214
THESE PEOPLE.

89
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:36,949
>> WE WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY

90
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,017
CLINTONS WERE THE GOOD OLD

91
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:38,417
DAYS.

92
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:40,219
I VOTED FOR BILL CLINTON

93
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,520
TWICE.

94
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,587
HILLARY CLINTON, THEY ARE

95
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:42,188
LOSING CONTROL.

96
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,990
THAT IS WHY ERIC HOLDER WHEN

97
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:45,291
THEY GO LOW, WE KICK THEM.

98
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,093
OWL OF THE THINGS, THESE ARE

99
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:48,160
NOT COINCIDENCES.

100
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:48,728
>> Tucker: RIGHT.

101
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,029
>> THIS IS NOT MAXINE WATERS

102
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,397
FIND THEM AND HUNT THEM DOWN

103
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:52,465
OR WHATEVER SHE SAID.

104
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,166
AND CORY BOOKER DID THE SAME

105
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:54,467
THING.

106
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:56,235
I HAVE SEEN ARTICLES ABOUT

107
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:57,036
YOU.

108
00:02:57,037 --> 00:02:58,371
FIND TUCKER CARLSON IN A

109
00:02:58,372 --> 00:02:58,771
RESTAURANT.

110
00:02:58,772 --> 00:02:59,872
SO UPSET HE WON'T GO TO A

111
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:00,273
RESTAURANT.

112
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:02,275
IF THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT WE

113
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:04,844
WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY MAN, WE

114
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:06,279
HAVE SCREWED UP THE MOST

115
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,346
BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENT DONE IN

116
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:08,514
WORLD HISTORY.

117
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:09,048
>> I AGREE.

118
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,616
>> ABOUT HOW YOU GET DIFFERENT

119
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:11,617
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

120
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:12,585
TO COME TOGETHER AND LIVE

121
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:12,952
TOGETHER.

122
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:14,287
WE HAVE DONE IT RIGHT HERE.

123
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:15,888
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PERFECT

124
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,423
FOR EVERYONE OR THAT THERE

125
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:19,191
AREN'T RACISTS OR THAT WE HAVE

126
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,294
THE CLASS ISSUES.

127
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,728
AND ECONOMIC ISSUES AND ALL

128
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:23,496
SORT OF THINGS.

129
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:25,097
BUT IF WE DON'T PULL BACK THIS

130
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:26,766
THING, IT WILL BE MUCH WORSE

131
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:27,433
FASTER THAN ANYONE CAN

132
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:27,833
IMAGINE.

133
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:28,768
>> Tucker: TOTALLY RIGHT.

134
00:03:28,769 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S MORE FRAGILE THAN WE
