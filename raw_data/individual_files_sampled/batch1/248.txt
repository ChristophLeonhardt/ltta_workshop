more death sentences imposed in Egypt 75 people for allegedly protesting against the 2013 coup will it deter opponents of the government will we see another military crackdown and is a reconciliation even possible now this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I am Hoshi mahabharatha there's been strong condemnation from human rights groups are the latest wave of death sentences imposed in Egypt most of the 75 convicted were taking part in a sit-in at a public square in Cairo five years ago protesting against a military coup hundreds of people died when security forces moved in the sentences are the latest in unrelenting crackdown on dissent in Egypt since current president Abdel Fattah has c.c. toppled Mohamed Morsi the country's first democratically elected president colleague has more five years after what's been called the largest mass killing in Egypt's modern history it seems the bloodshed has yet to end more than 900 protesters were killed by Egyptian security forces in a matter of hours during a sit-in in Cairo's rabaa al-adawiya Square in 2013 they were protesting against the military takeover by this man President Abdel Fattah el-sisi who deposed Egypt's first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi as more than 85,000 supporters demonstrated against the coup security forces moved in now five years on a court in Cairo has sentenced 75 people to death it's mine Mohamed roschmann and you see Mohammad Suleman are sentenced to death those sentenced to death were part of a mass trial of 739 people convicted of charges from incitement to violence murder and membership of the now outlawed group the Muslim Brotherhood senior members of the organization were among those given life sentences including its spiritual leader Mohammed Boudia the judge handed prison terms to 39 others as well as the known photojournalist Mahmoud Abbas eard also known as Chacon he'll now be released after serving his five-year sentence in pretrial detention having been arrested while photographing the day that changed many Egyptian lives in hizmet joking homes I did the sentence is unfair because shokhin didn't commit any crime to be imprisoned for five years he was a journalist only doing his job the sentence wasn't based on any evidence it was based only on police investigations as the court has said we also have proof of his innocence human rights organizations have condemned the mass trial calling it a mockery of justice we have yet to see according to Amnesty International calls the greatest massacre of protesters by a government in modern history of over a thousand people shocked by it by the Egyptian security apparatus is not a single person has yet to be held into account and so in many ways today just signifies the symbolic force that has become of the Egyptian judiciary and political establishment the court's decision now goes to Egypt top religious leader the Grand Mufti but his judgement is seen as a formality and he's expected to approve the executions lawyers of the convicted say they'll appeal the sentences for Inside Story Kara leg al-jazeera let's bring in our panel in Doha Mohammed Al Masry associate professor of media and cultural studies and chair of the journalism program at the door Institute for Graduate Studies New York Sahar Aziz professor of law at the Rogers University in New Jersey and director of the center security rays and rice from Zurich via Skype Maggie diamond or a political analyst welcome to the program Mohammad are we going to see any and to these mass trials any time soon in Egypt well it's unlikely the Egyptian government post 2013 has been hell-bent on an elimination ax strategy right they're trying to root out all forms of dissent and opposition obviously we know about the mass killings that they carried out in the streets we know about banning political parties and media outlets part of this though is intimidating activists and so there are 60,000 plus political prisoners we've seen several mass death sentences following mass trials which are quite absurd there's no possibility to establish individual guilt in these mass trials and so this was this was just one in a long line it's unfortunate and it's probably unlikely that this sort of repression stops anytime soon sorry this is a campaign of intimidation as Mohamed has been just saying I mean every single mass trial has been described by international human rights groups as a charade grotesque parody of justice yet the government insists this is quite legitimate what kind of message do you think the government is trying to convey here I think it shows that the Sisi regime feels very insecure internally they seem to be approaching it as an existential threat to their political power by taking the scorched earth approach to mass prosecutions mass death sentences and as you said engaging in activities that undermines the rule of law in Egypt and effectively defames Egypt's reputation internationally part of the reason that he can get a with it is because President Trump of the United States has signaled to him that he can and that he will not be punishing Egypt at least in terms of holding any foreign aid or criticizing in the public arena in the international public arena so Sisi feels quite emboldened and in fact in July the u.s. just approved another 195 million dollars of foreign aid to Egypt notwithstanding that there is the Leahy Act that prohibits the u.s. from providing for an aid to countries that violate human rights so we as a country here in the United States where I'm based we've essentially given him the green light and I think the American citizens need to be very concerned about where their taxpayer money is going because right now it's supporting human rights violations in Egypt Magadh what are people saying about these trials well it's it's very hard to gauge and very hard to know because as you would know this is all very censored and very controlled so even though the even though the Brotherhood has lost a lot of popular support it remains an integral part of the Egyptian let's say society so I'm pretty sure that it's not widely accepted that it's fair however there is also a lot of support for the regime so we're not as quick as as it as it might look mm-hmm Mohamed you you said that basically you expect this crackdown to continue however one of the cases mohamed abu zaid known as Shokan spent five years in jail he's been he warned the unesco world freedom prize i mean you you can see on one hand the government is determined by the same time there's an international backlash at least when it comes to the coverage of the cases of the activists who have been detained by the syria by the egyptian government yeah well i think first of all the the backlash has waned a little bit over the last couple of years and just to sadhas point I think she made a good point when she said that the Egyptian government pretty much feels emboldened and why wouldn't they feel emboldened there has been very little consequence there have been very few repercussions for them they've committed more human rights violations than any government in in the history of modern Egypt and yet international diplomacy military aid weapons sales they've all they've all proceeded as you know business as usual in terms of Chokin wood was aid I think that it's interesting to note as my colleague professor Daniel Femi noted yesterday that after you know five years keeping him in jail charging him with you know felony offenses including murder that they're just gonna let they're gonna let him go and that's an indication that they never had any evidence on him to begin with so here's a young man who's lost five who essentially lost five years of his life Saha in technical terms can some of these cases be overturned or do you think that they would ultimately be upheld by the by the grand mufti and by the Supreme Court's well a lot of it depends on what at what extent that judiciary is independent and in the last four or five years we've seen an erosion of judicial independence primarily through unspoken behind-the-scenes fear tactics against judges so the Egyptian executive has successfully placed certain judges that are known to be loyalists in these cases so that they could predict the outcome which would be convictions and at the same time has signaled to those judges who have not been as obedient to the executive as this president would like they have forced them into retirement they had subjected them to false pretextual disciplinary hearings and they have punished them in other ways so much of it is going to depend on the judges some of these cases do get reversed and some of the death sentences are not approved by the most evil who also faces pressure by the state unfortunately I think most of the pressure has to come from the International Human Rights communities we can no longer rely on the US government we certainly can't rely on the Egyptian government and I think it's time for those who care about human rights abroad to be advocating very aggressively for support of those rights and not allowing Western taxpayer dollars to support these dictatorial regimes that effectively produce more instability in that region and I predict there will probably be another mass uprising although this time we will be based on economic hardship because Egypt is suffering from very severe economic problems right now Magadh what would the government gain internationally from the scenes of some of the old leaders hit by the death penalty some of them out of their 80s who were part of an official political parties that want the elections and they have their one of their members elected as the first democratically elected president in Egypt I mean you would it begs the question what is government trying to do here well I think the government is trying to send a very clear signal is that there will be no reconciliation there will be no reintegration of the Brotherhood in any way shape or form into the political process and that means that one of the largest political parties in the country will not that they participate legally if they will carry out the death sentences that remains to be seen but also the strategy can be to prolong it and they would remain in jail for a long period until they pass away because the conditions as well in in in in jails are our our let's say horrendous and so that can be a strategy that they're following as well Mohamed has been this feeling after the last elections that SEC would go for a softer approach trying to reach out to the opposition and the Muslim Brotherhood in particular with this particular mass right that does not seem to be the case anymore no I I think that I I agree with with Magadh that the message that's being sent here is that reconciliation is not is not on the table it's not an option the government has tried very hard to bury the Muslim Brotherhood right so and certainly they've succeeded in that at least at least publicly they've they've arrested or killed the first several tiers of Brotherhood leadership they've banned their their media they've banned their political party and and they've carried out these these mass arrests mass death sentences on Brotherhood members and supporters obviously they broke up protests and so they shut down NGOs which I don't think we should we should we should forget we should they shut down websites that shut down charitable organizations so the Brotherhood is essentially buried at least from from the public from public view the Brotherhood is still popular in Egypt we don't know exactly how popular because the Egyptian government doesn't allow opinion polling any longer but I think that certainly from a political standpoint from a social standpoint the government wants the Brotherhood to sort of to sort of go away they don't want to deal with her Brotherhood as a political rival any longer and certainly at this point there doesn't look like there's any space for the Brotherhood to operate Saha the man who used to deliver stinger remarks and rebukes about Egypt's track record when it comes to human rights was the late Senator McCain are we likely to see anyone who would step in in the near future under the trump administration to try to change the course of things I don't think there's any hope for expecting anything from the White House because frankly I think and domestic level Trump himself as an authoritarian and the only thing that's keeping him from being as severe as other authoritarians are the institutions within the United States and the press and civil society which is precisely why CC has gone after and tried to destroy the Free Press and civil society in Egypt and by the way it's not only the Muslim Brotherhood that he has effectively quashed but it's also the self-identified liberals of Egypt who now have no political space to have meaningful political parties in fact during Ramadan an iftar dinner was attacked by the police that was hosted by a bunch of liberal parties so the the plan in Egypt is we don't want any competition any type of political activity whatsoever going back to the US I think unfortunately in Congress right now most congressional leaders are either focused on the domestic arena in trying to switch the Congress to be more democratic controlled by the Democratic Party and very few of them are globally focused so I don't expect much pressure from the US government but I do want to know one thing we have 20 American citizens in Egyptian jails right now and what is our government doing to protect them and to ensure that they're getting fair due process trials Mostafa Qasim is one of them who was a New York City Taxi Driver and was at the wrong place at the wrong time during the robber suckers we have Ola Cara da we who is the daughter of the shiokara da minha she's a u.s. green card holder she's not a citizen but she has children that are US citizens and she lived much of her life in the u.s. she's in jail for retaliation against her father and we have again 20 American citizens and I I cannot believe that the Trump administration does not care about its own citizens and what signal does this send about the value of US citizenship abroad in front of these dictators imagine speaking of the muted international response could it be an indication that leaders across the board are trying to tell the Muslim Brotherhood and the activists in Egypt you have to leave that chapter behind and move forward and that ultimately you have to face reality which is basically that the military establishment and the Fatah has c.c. are the ones who call the final shots well there is no reality to look forward to there is no space for any democratic participation CC is basically trying to convert the country into a full-blown military dictatorship there is no reconciliation in any way shape or form and he doesn't seem to allow to leave some space at least for some sort of controlled descent there is no room for any disagreements so I don't know what they would be saying to any political activist the moment okay it it's a ridiculous notion the Mohamed the establishment is quite interesting when you have the latest developments in Egypt the establishment does not seem to tolerate opposition that is not necessary which is not necessarily confined to the Islamists or to the Muslim Brotherhood we've seen the case of Samia man who was sent to jail just because he was seen as a potential rival Bassam irzu Yaga's as Hisham Janina all sent to jail because they express their views what does it tell about the about about ceases situation in Egypt you know I think as somebody mentioned previously he's obviously insecure I mean I think that's that's one of the messages here one of the lessons that we can that we can learn but I think the other thing I think the bigger issue is that the Egyptian military establishment and the security forces in general learned a very valuable lesson during the Arab Spring and in particular in Egypt in 2011 when Hosni Mubarak the 30 year dictator was ousted there the lesson that they learned unfortunately for for Egyptian citizens is that the government hadn't been harsh enough and so they're really trying to sort of be more repressive more authoritarian than the Mubarak government ever was and that's why we see all of these unprecedented human rights abuses so how this is their what baffles me I mean the government wants to build a new capital in the desert encourages investors to come in and tourists to pick up a tourism to pick up pick up in his country but how can you achieve that when your track record is is contested challenged by the international community and I think that is effectively his weak spot both domestically and internationally so internationally Egypt needs to have a good reputation particularly to attract tourists the last thing it needs is to be seen as an unsafe place or a place that is repressive in a way that could cause already sensitive tourists not to want to go there and that's where I think Sisi should be reconsidering his practices and domestically domestically his weaknesses economic the inflation rate is officially at 13 percent I think more effectively it's in the 20s and 30s unemployment's at 11 percent officially when you look at people under the age of 35 it goes up to the 20 percentile you have many college students or college graduates who are now driving uber because that is the only way to make money they have no employment prospects and inflation is up wages are stagnant he's now starting to increase taxes through value-added taxes through income taxes and the Egyptian people are starting to become very resentful and that is one area where you are hearing open dissent against him so if the Egyptian government wants to be smart about its governance at the very least it needs to ensure that it develops its economy and violating human rights does not assist it in that objective market we've seen over the last few months president of the Fatah has c.c. of firing some of his closest aides implementing new restrictions on media particularly the new law about social media accounts and the fact that if you have more than 5,000 followers and Twitter for example then you would be monitored by a particular body in Egypt some of the staunch journalists who are defending al Sisi have recently been banned we talking here about a new transformation in Egypt or what was it in particular well it's very hard to tell because the regime is quite let's say opaque but how whether it is very clear that that that he is taking more of a hard line and that he is becoming more and more repressive especially after the elections so it seems to be general direction and the general policy were even insider descendants within the regime itself is no longer tolerate okay Mohammed I mean don't you think that this also begs another question about being realistic in Egypt a particular when it comes to the Muslim Brotherhood it also they don't seem to have supporters anymore all over the world the facing a harsh new reality they've been completely undermined that top leadership is in jail and we haven't seen their own people on the streets for quite some time is this the moment for the MB to start reinventing itself I don't know how successful they would be you know doing that right now as I mentioned earlier they've been they've been pretty much completely buried they've lost members either through death or imprisonment some people have left the organization I think that it's you know ideally this would be a time for the Muslim Brotherhood to you know to do some soul-searching and to try to reinvent itself but how does one reinvent himself or herself in in such a closed and repressive environment they are officially banned Muslim Brotherhood supporters or people who are known to have been Brotherhood members are not even allowed to run for office in Egypt as independent candidates so how can you reinvent yourself in that context in less than 30 seconds haha can international human rights organizations now step in and try to change things in Egypt or at least change the perception that we seen internationally about what's happening absolutely I think international human rights organizations have access to the media they can mobilize citizens in the West where there is more democratic processes they can give a platform two Egyptians and other Arabs who seek reform within their countries and give them a voice and human rights has always been the underdog and the only way that you fight for justice is to take risks so I think this is exactly the time when the international human rights community needs to step up and challenge these dictators
