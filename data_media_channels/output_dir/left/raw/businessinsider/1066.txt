10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,590
executive order is a directive by the

President to the officers and officials

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,600
of the executive branch you wouldn't

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,040
have an executive order directing a

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,870
private person to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do</font>

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,670
have the effect of law and they do find

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,650
private persons for example in their

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,490
dealings with executive officials

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,020
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pursuant to a congressional</font>

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,869
statute as most executive orders are the

21
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,670
Congress can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say no we</font>

22
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,470
didn't mean that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have a some</font>

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,300
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bill considered in both houses</font>

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,130
that would then be an enactment that

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,320
would go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> present pre signature</font>

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,119
now remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the president has the</font>

27
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,070
power of the veto so if he interprets

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,020
the statute a certain way issues an

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,430

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">and both houses of Congress disagree he</font>

31
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,960
can still be telling Congress will have

to pass legislation over<font color="#E5E5E5"> his veto by two</font>

34
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,080
they can't override it if on the other

overridden by Congress but it could be

42
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:05,940
overridden by the courts courts could
