let me bring in Matt Miller MSNBC justice and security analyst and former chief spokesman from the Justice Department former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York Jennifer Rogers Peter Baker is Whitehouse bureau chief for the New York Times and an MSNBC political analyst it's great to have you all here on set so Peter within the last 48 hours give or take you had Rudy Giuliani issuing what was I guess sort of a retraction or correction at the behest of the president but then he goes on TV he talks about maybe hush money for some other women who are not sir me daniels he talks about potentially the Fifth Amendment against incrimination this is a guy right listen he brought in to smooth the waters with robert muller and improve communication to the outside world well I think when it brought into was to be on television I think what President Trump has shown it repeatedly as he likes people who he's seen on television battling on his behalf being tough on some of these issues and I think he decided his last lawyers weren't doing that right John Dowd and Ty Cobb had preached the idea of cooperation with the special cutting back so and listening to legal analysts after legal analysts after legal analysts including some quoted in your newspaper saying he's digging the president deeper and deeper and deeper the difference between a television personality and a lawyer right and most lawyers who have a client trouble are very careful and cautious about what they say Matt obviously knows about this obviously know about this this is not Ruby's role that's not how he sees his old his role isn't get out there and hit hit hit against the investigation you hear a guy who's to be US Attorney talking about his old Justice Department ways are pretty surprising right and maybe gives him more credibility because he had been there but he's been very critical of the just Department Robert Mahler at the same time sort of speaking out of turn you would think and in the way that the White House would prefer a talk yeah out of turn is one way to put it Alan Dershowitz who has gone repeatedly on television backing up the president I'm gonna suggest it's not a good day when Alan Dershowitz goes on TV and questions what's happening with Rudy Giuliani let's take a listen is this legal strategy that mr. Giuliani is pursuing here is this been well thought out over the last few days no I don't think so I think this was a very bad week for the Trump team the Trump team has to speak with a single narrative they have to get their story clearly set out it has to be put in writing it shouldn't be put on television shows off the cuff bottom line question Jennifer is the president in more legal trouble now potentially than he was before Rudy Giuliani started talking on his bath I think you're right Chris he's he isn't a bit more trouble there have been inconsistent statements and you know listen if prosecutors actually decide to bring this campaign finance violation as a case they'll be looking underneath these comments they're gonna be looking for what actually happened who paid the money how it was paid who knew what what the communications were but they'll keep these back-and-forth the Rudy comments the Trump comments kind of in their back pocket and you know probably use those too if that ends up going to court where's the specific peril in what Rudy Giuliani said well specific peril is that he comes out and says things that aren't necessarily backed up by the facts as you've seen by his own admission he's making claims about law for example that there was no campaign finance violation and then coming back afterwards and saying actually I haven't gathered all the facts so you have both him creating new legal liabilities when he says things that add potential motive to what the president did for you explain that the prey that it might be a cat you know might have been a campaign finance problem the stormy Daniels reimbursement but then also in terms of a public relations strategy this is kind of what would happen if Donald Trump was a lawyer so he's coming out he's doing everything on the fly he's talking on TV a lot but without a plan in advance and without necessarily what he says being backed up by the facts and the problem is in a legal situation the facts are gonna come out eventually now what Rudy Giuliani has said is not true it both creates legal problems and it is hugely embarrassing for the White House what are you hearing inside the White House Peter I mean how much concern is there is there a sense that Rudy Giuliani look you can make the argument that anybody who goes to work for this White House could have a short shelf life we have certainly seen evidence to support that and yet as you rightfully point out this is someone who has consistently come out and been an attack dog on behalf of this president yeah look at what people who have been surprised by this just like everybody there watching TV and learning things just like everyone else or if not learning things hearing things and not quite sure what to credit what not to credit and it's very frustrating I think for a white house that is trying to defend a president and trying to focus on the things that they want to care about they want to talk about North Korea they want to talk about Iran they want to talk about all kinds of big issues that are coming up this week and instead they're watching Rudy Giuliani kind of in the slow motion car crash that forces them to answer questions they disengage Ani suggested as we said that maybe he doesn't know for sure but maybe other payments were made to other women as hush money in addition to stormy Daniels here's what Michael avenatti who loves to respond and does it well so this kind of thing had to say about it according to Rudy Giuliani this was basically commonplace that the president had effectively an extramarital affair slush fund that was administered by Michael Cohen and that he would just be expected to take care of these things they were a regular occurrence I mean that in and of itself should be very disturbing most people of means most people have wealth is celebrity they don't have extramarital that affair slush funds and the suggestion is insulting so then that brings us to the Wall Street Journal story today they say as much as seven hundred and seventy four thousand dollars were taken out his lines of credit by Michael Cohen we know that one hundred and thirty thousand dollars went to stormy Daniels does that raise the question if you're an investigator for Matt Miller where'd the rest of the money go and we know that Michael avenatti has said there are other women who have come to him with stories that could potentially also be believable yeah it raises the question and I think that money that The Wall Street Journal reported that Michael Cohen has withdrawn that could be money to for settlements on behalf of the president that could be money that was used for other activities that are under an investigation by the Southern District New York I think Michael Cohen's legal liabilities both include the president whatever he did on behalf of the president and his own problems that are his uniquely we don't know the answer that but to this point of Rudy Giuliani so when you are the president's lawyer or even if you're not his real lawyer but his play-play lawyer on TV is Peter posits you're supposed to put out fires not create new ones in addition to learning about this money the 700,000 he told Maggie Haberman of the New York Times that Donald Trump paid Michael Cohen somewhere between 450 and 460 thousand dollars obviously only 130,000 of it went to stormy Daniels was the rest of it for other women as he said might have occurred on television yesterday was it for some other purpose for Donald Trump we don't know the answer to that but that's a new fact that Rudy Giuliani put on the record that could be hugely damaging just I just was reminded I was sitting exactly where I am now and there was a four water gate process prosecutor saying exactly where you are at the beginning of all this who said to me to quote the movie follow the money as you again follow the money the other question that's been raised is Cohen is somebody who supposedly made tens of millions of dollars right on real estate transactions why is he taking out of a line of credit for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars who's that the kind of basic question that prosecutors are gonna follow yeah that's a good question I mean who knows right a lot of people make a lot of money losing miles a lot of money spend a lot of money but the great thing about following the money when you're in court is it it puts to the side all of these political arguments you know you you can't you can't show that the money goes where it goes you can't fake it right it's it's evidence it doesn't rely on people believing someone or not believing someone so it's it's kind of incontrovertible evidence and that's why prosecutors love to use it because this argument that they're just after Trump they'll make things up thereafter Cohen you know they'll lie doesn't hold up when you talk about following money and tracing it through its steps so that's why that kind of evidence is so important and why they will continue to do that as these cases move forward and one of the questions I get maybe you guys do too is that that people sometimes get confused like well what does it matter if Rudy Giuliani says something what does that have to do with a legal case against the president I think that congressman Adam Schiff who by the way is the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee kind of tried to answer that question here's the point he made yes he can lie to the public and he can't be charged with lying to the public now if you lies to Bob Muller it's a different story but these public statements by the president that are demonstrable false do demonstrate some consciousness of guilt and if I were the prosecutor in the case I would certainly introduce these false statements as evidence against the president you can make the argument could you Peter that when somebody like Rudy Guiliani makes the statements he makes and suggests that it came from the president or then the president has to respond to it and then has conflicting stories all of this then does become intertwined but we've seen so far in 15 16 months in office is the president's own words have been used against him in court repeatedly not just in a criminal type situation we're talking about with Bob mola but even in cases like the travel ban for instance every time a policy is challenged in court lawyers have gone in and said look what the president said and the White House lawyers have been put in the awkward position is basically saying let's not pay attention to what the president said let's only pay attention to the policy or this memo or have you in effect that's what Rudy Giuliani has sort of set up here in this case as well in which there's going to be a don't pay attention to what was said on television kind of argument just pay attention to the the facts the evidence the documents but it's gonna be really hard because it's another distraction for them yeah and I would think it'd be really hard if you were really Rudy Giuliani and you were doing everything well and your job is to try to smooth the waters with Robert Muller when your boss constantly repeats witch-hunt witch-hunt which on it complicates matters Matt Miller Jennifer Rogers Peter Baker good to have all of you here hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC
