AINSLEY: THIS IS A FOX NEWS
ALERT.
THE SENATE PREPARING TO VOTE
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH WITH THE
CAUSATIVE LATEST REPORT.
PETE: WITH A.
BRIAN: HIS OR HER TO WEIGH
IN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
FRONT AND CENTER THE ENTIRE
PROCESS.
CHUCK GRASSLEY.
SENATOR, FIRST OFF, TODAY WE
ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE
VOTE AT 11:00.
DUPE ALREADY HOW IT'S GOING
TO GO?
OUR LEADER SAID YESTERDAY
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE
WE WON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING
TO GO UNTIL EVERYBODY HAS
CAST THEIR VOTE.
SO WE DON'T AS OF NOW I
DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY ELSE DOES.
BRIAN: THE CLOTURE VOTE WILL
THAT LIKELY PASS BECAUSE
THAT'S NOT THE FINAL VOTE
AND THE ONE UP FOR GRABS IS
THE BIG ONE?
>> I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO
FIND BOTH VOTES ABOUT THE
SAME FOR EVERYBODY.
AINSLEY: SENATOR, HOW DO WE
NOT KNOW HOW JEFF FLAKE AND
SUSAN COLLINS, MURKOWSKI AND
MANCHIN ARE GOING TO VOTE?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY
ARE NOT SAYING?
ARE THEY WAITING UNTIL THE
VERY END BECAUSE THEY DON'T
WANT TO BE SWAYED BY THEIR
VOTERS?
WHAT MORE INFORMATION DO
THEY NEED?
WE ALREADY HAVE THE FBI
REPORT.
WHY DON'T WE KNOW HOW THEY
ARE GOING TO VOTE?
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY
PERSONAL, VERY QUIET ABOUT
IT AND I THINK THAT THEY
WANT -- LEGITIMATELY I FOUND
MYSELF IN THE SAME POSITION.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE BEFORE
YOU MAKE A FINAL DECISION,
YOU WANT YOUR CONSTITUENTS
TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE VERY
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT IT AND WHAT
MIGHT COME UP NEW.
THEY ARE GOING TO WAIT IN
THE LAST MINUTE.
I HAVE BEEN IN THAT SAME
POSITION.
SO I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD IT
AGAINST THEM FOR NOT
ANNOUNCING AHEAD OF TIME.
BRIAN: WE WILL SEE WHERE
THAT GOES.
MURKOWSKI WANTS TO GO BACK
AND SEE MORE.
DOESN'T FEEL AS THOUGH SHE
HAD ENOUGH TIME.
SO DOES MANCHIN, I THINK.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE LINED UP
ALMOST IN UNISON OUTSIDE OF
MANCHIN SAYING THIS IS A
SHAM.
MENENDEZ USES AN EXPLICATIVE
SAYING IT'S ALL B.S.
DESPITE THE THOUSAND PAGES
AND THE MULTIPLE INTERVIEWS.
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE
PEOPLE THAT DEMANDED ONE
WEEK FOR AN EVALUATION LAST
WEEK ARE SAYING IT'S NOT
ENOUGH THIS WEEK?
>> NOT ONLY THAT BUT DURING
OUR LAST HEARING, THEY SAID
WE OUGHT TO BE HAVING THE
FBI LOOK AT ONE PERSON, ONLY
ONE PERSON.
ENDED UP LOOKING AT ABOUT 12
PEOPLE.
BUT THEY NEED TO LOOK AT
THIS GUY, HIS LAST NAME IS
JUDGE.
THEY WENT WAY BEYOND THAT
THEY AREN'T SATISFIED.
THEY ARE ALWAYS MOVING THE
GOAL POST.
I THINK YOU HAVE GOT TO GO
BACK TO JULY THE 10TH.
WHEN SCHUMER SAID HE IS
GOING TO DO ANYTHING UNDER
THE SUN TO DEFEAT THIS
NOMINATION.
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HAVE A
FAIR AND THOROUGH AND OPEN
HEARING AND I THINK WE HAVE
DONE EXACTLY THAT TO GET
EVERYTHING OUT ON THE TAPE.
AND I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH
A DEMOLITION DERBY ON THE
PART OF THE DEMOCRATS WHERE
THEY HAVE BEEN OUT TO DO
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO
DEFEAT HIM.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU
WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD
BE CONCENTRATING ON IS HE
QUALIFIED TO COME ON
QUALIFIED TO BOME ON
QUALIFIED TO BEME ON
QUALIFIED TO BE O ON
QUALIFIED TO BE ONON
QUALIFIED TO BE ON THE
COURT.
12 YEARS ON THE D.C.
CIRCUIT.
307 DECISIONS.
WHAT IS THERE ABOUT THIS
PERSON THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE
ON THE SUPREME COURT.
NO, HIS QUALIFICATIONS HAVE
NOT BEEN AT ISSUE.
EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN AT
ISSUE IS SECONDARY THINGS.
AINSLEY: SENATOR, WHAT DO
YOU THINK ABOUT PROTESTERS
ATTACKING YOUR COLLEAGUES IN
ELEVATORS.
ORRIN HAPPEN AND JEFF
ORRIN HATPEN AND JEFF
ORRIN HATCHN AND JEFF
ORRIN HATCH AAND JEFF
ORRIN HATCH ANDD JEFF
ORRIN HATCH AND JJEFF
ORRIN HATCH AND JEFFF
ORRIN HATCH AND JEFF FLAKE.
>> I THINK IT'S A REFLECTION
OF THE INCIVILITY OF
AMERICAN SOCIETY GENERALLY
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO
EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WILL GO
TO ANY LENGTH WHEN THEY ARE
ENCOURAGED BY PEOPLE ON
CAPITOL HILL LIKE ONE
CONGRESSWOMAN SAYING
CONFRONT THEM IN THE
RESTROOMS.
GO UP AND ANOTHER SENATOR
SAYING GET IN THEIR FACE.
WE AS SENATORS OUGHT TO BE
SETTING EXAMPLES FOR
CIVILITY, NOT ENCOURAGING
INCIVILITY.
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE
RESISTANCE SINCE
NOVEMBER 2016.
YOU ARE SEEING THE REISIS
RESISTANCE HEADQUARTERS
RIGHT HERE ON CAPITOL HILL
ALL AMONG DEMOCRATS.
PETE: WOULD ANY OF YOUR
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ADMIT
THAT?
YOU SAY WE HAVE GONE TOO
FAR?
HEAT TOO HIGH.
THIS NEVER HAPPENED TO ELENA
KAGAN AND SOTOMAYOR IN THE
HALLWAYS.
>> DON'T FORGET, THERE ARE
SOME PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT
THAT GET OVERLY AMBITIOUS
AND VICIOUS AS WELL.
WE HERE ON CAPITOL HILL,
HAVE TO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR
CIVILITY.
BRIAN: RIGHT.
SENATOR, CHAIRMAN,
UNDERSTAND THAT LEE LAND
KAISER, THE FORMER FRIEND OF
DR. FORD FEELS PRESSURE TO
REVISIT OTHER DENIAL OF
KNOWING ABOUT THE ALLEGED
ASSAULT BACK IN 10TH GRADE.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HER
SAYING THAT SHE FEELS
PRESSURED BY DEMOCRATS TO
CHANGE HER STORY?
>> THERE IS EVIDENCE -- I
CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT BECAUSE
IT'S IN THE FBI REPORT.
BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE ABOUT
OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN
QUESTIONED THAT THEY WERE
LED INTO IT AS WELL.
THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
HEADQUARTERS FOR THE
RESISTANCE BEING RIGHT HERE
ON CAPITOL HILL.
>> AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH
DEBRA -- DR. FORD'S
COLLABORATION WITH THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
WHAT PAPERWORK DO YOU WANT
TO SEE THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
YET?
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE IN
TERMS OF THE COMMUNICATION?
>> POLYGRAPH.
OTHER THINGS THAT SHE TALKED
ABOUT TO "THE WASHINGTON
POST."
IF SHE CAN TALK TO THE "THE
WASHINGTON POST" ABOUT IT,
SHE OUGHT TO TALK TO US.
BUT, LET'S GET BACK TO THE
WILL
LELL
LEGITIMACY OF FORD COMING
FORWARD.
IF SHE WAS -- SHE WAS
ASSAULTED, I BELIEVE SHE WAS
ASSAULTED.
THERE IS NO CORROBORATION
ABOUT HER JUDGMENT THAT IT
WAS JUDGE KAVANAUGH, BUT
HAVE YOU GOT TO TAKE SEXUAL
ASSAULT ACCUSATIONS VERY
SERIOUSLY.
WE DON'T DO THAT ENOUGH IN
AMERICAN SOCIETY.
AND THIS -- WHETHER FORD IS
RIGHT ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH
OR NOT, THE FACT THAT WE HAD
A BRINGING TO PEOPLE'S
ATTENTION THE MAJOR SOCIAL
PROBLEM WE HAVE ABOUT SEXUAL
ASSAULT, THAT IS AT LEAST
ONE GOOD ACCOMPLISHED BY
DR. FORD COMING FORWARD EVEN
EVEN THOUGH SHE WANTED
ANONYMITY AND EVEN THOUGH
SENATOR FEINSTEIN OR OTHER
DEMOCRATS ON THE COMMITTEE
DIDN'T PROTECT HER
CONFIDENTIALITY.
AINSLEY: THANK YOU FOR
