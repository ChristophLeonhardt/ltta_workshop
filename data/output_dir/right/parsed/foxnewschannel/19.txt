COMMISSIONER, STAND BY FOR JUST
A SECOND.
SIDE NOTE, THE FBI ALSO
INVESTIGATING AS WE MENTIONED A
DELAWARE POST OFFICE WE
MENTIONED AND A NINTH PACKAGE
ADDRESSED TO VICE PRESIDENT
JOE BIDEN, FORMER
VICE PRESIDENT.
THE POST OFFICE IS 10 MILES FROM
WHERE MR. BIDEN LIVES.
THAT IS A NEW IMAGE WE HAVE NOT
SEEN YET.
IT COMES AFTER POSSIBLY BEING
MAILED TO HIS HOME YESTERDAY.
WE THIS PICTURE FROM FOX 29
REPORTER CHRIS O'CONNELL OF THE
DEVICE SENT TO THE POST OFFICE.
BERNIE KERIK, WE SAW THE ONE
IMAGE OF THE PACKAGE THAT
ARRIVED AT CNN ADDRESSED TO JOHN
BRENNAN WHICH WAS MISSPELLED BUT
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE
GOTTEN A REALLY CLEAR LOOK.
IF WE COULD PUT IT UP ONCE
AGAIN, A REALLY CLEAR LOOK AT
THE PACKAGE ADDRESSED TO
JOE BIDEN.
AINSLEY: JUST LIKE THE ONE
ADDRESSED TO JOHN BRENNAN,
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE, MAYBE I'M
WRONG, DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE
IS ANY INK OVER THE STAMPS,
NORMALLY SENT THROUGH THE POSTAL
SERVICE.
STEVE: HASN'T BEEN CANCELED.
AINSLEY: SO YOU CAN'T REUSE THE
STAMPS.
>> RIGHT.
STEVE: PUT THE IMAGE BIGGER IN
THE CONTROL ROOM.
GO AHEAD, BERNIE.
>> LISTEN, THE ONE THING I FOUND
FASCINATING HAND DELIVERY
ELEMENT OF THIS, THE
INVESTIGATION, WHERE THESE
THINGS WERE DELIVERED BY HAND OF
SOME SORT TO SOROS, TO THE
CLINTON RESIDENCE AND MAYBE
OTHERS.
THERE'S NO WAY, THESE PEOPLE,
WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS,
THERE'S NO WAY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
CAPTURED ON VIDEO ALREADY.
BRIAN: YEAH.
WE SAW THAT IN AUSTIN, RIGHT?
REMEMBER WE SAW THAT IN AUSTINS.
DIDN'T SHARE IT UNTIL THEY FOUND
THE GUY?
>> EXACTLY.
STEVE: ONE OTHER THING ABOUT IT
PARTICULAR PACKAGE, APPARENTLY
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ'S
RETURN ADDRESS AS WELL, SEE THE
BAND AT A DIAGONAL, APPARENTLY
POSTAGE DUE, WHO SENT IT TO
JOE BIDEN WAS $3 AND CHANGE
SHORT.
HE PUT THE SIX FOREVER STAMPS
THINKING, COMMISSIONER, HE
WOULDN'T HAVE TO TALK TO
SOMEBODY BEHIND THE COUNTER AT
THE POST OFFICE BUT HE WAS
SHORT.
AINSLEY: WHICH MEANS IT WILL BE
RETURNED TO DEBBIE
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
>> EXACTLY.
THIS IS AMATEUR STUFF.
FOR ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT
THAT HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR A
WHILE, IF YOU SAW THAT PACKAGE,
YOU WOULD PUT THAT PACKAGE ASIDE
TO WANT A LOOK AT IT AS IT IS.
I GIVE THE GUYS IN THE POSTAL
SERVICE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF
CREDIT.
THEY CAUGHT SOME OF THIS STUFF,
EARLY ON STUFF IN SCREENING.
YOU KNOW NORMAL SCREENING.
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO THINK
THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING.
THAT IS A CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE
TOO.
BRIAN: COMMISSIONER, THANKS SO
MUCH.
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING, PLEASE
CALL US.
WE'RE HEARING SIRENS IN THE
BACKGROUND.
WE'RE IN DOWNTOWN NEW YORK CITY.
AINSLEY: AMBULANCE.
BRIAN: AS WE FOCUS ON PLACE
WE'RE LOCATED IT IS NOT ONLY
PLACE WHERE THERE IS ACTION, WE
HAVE A MAN WORKING ACROSS THE
POLICE FROM THE POST OFFICE
REACTING WHAT HE SAW WHEN HE GOT
TO WORK IN THE PHILADELPHIA
AREA.
STEVE: NEW CASTLE, DELAWARE.
BRIAN: NEW, CASTLE, DELAWARE, HE
DIDN'T KNOW -- LET'S WATCH.
>> THAT'S CRAZY.
WE LIVE IN A CRAZY WORLD.
IT IS NONSENSE THAT THEY DO
THINGS LIKE THIS.
IT IS JUST FOR ATTENTION.
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
BE LIKE THIS.
STEVE: SOUNDS AS IF A NIGHT
PACKAGE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED TO
THE VICE PRESIDENT.
THEY DID A SWEEP OF HIS HOME
YESTERDAY IN DELAWARE AND THEY
COULD NOT FIND, YOU KNOW, THAT
PACKAGE.
AS IT TURNS OUT IT WAS STILL AT
THE POST OFFICE.
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE WITH
POSTAGE DUE, WITH A DEBBIE
