now here's why I don't think it's true I mean there are lots of reasons where I don't think it's true this lady you know I don't I'm not gonna attack her maybe she remembers this maybe she doesn't she told it to a therapist in 2012 this is the first thing she told it to it there in the story to a therapist in in 2012 30 years after it happened she had never told it to anyone before that he was trying to take off her bathing suit this story in the therapist note don't mint match the story that she's telling now they don't name Kavanagh and they say that there were four men in the room now she says that his two men in the room you know but this she says that's the therapists fault she took the notes wrong how on earth how on earth do you defend yourself against the charge like that how on earth do you defend yourself so I dismiss it on that the the woman Christine Blasi Ford has a hazy recollection of the energy of the incident she was drunk she doesn't remember what happened this the idea I spend this before but the idea that they released this year this charge after the healing was over they did the same thing this is the Anita Hill playbook this is the Anita Hill playbook Anita Hill came forward and I didn't care about that either you know you know in with Clinton I didn't want Clinton to be impeached for what what he did the only thing about Clinton was it was revelatory of his constant character Bill Clinton's affair that he had in the offices that we pay for was revelatory of his constant character he was constantly using and abusing women for his pleasure he was constantly using and abusing Hillary for his power you know I mean she treated her like garbage and she didn't like it very much by according to all accounts so that said something about his character this says nothing about the guy however again Kavanagh has been investigated six times there all these women who have come forward and said that he was a wonderful guy 65 women signed an affidavit the left's response to that was that proves he's a bad guy why would he have to have so many people come forward if you know if he didn't it wasn't defending anything else himself against something so the more people who come forward to defend you if you happen to be a conservative that condemns you that if that's what condemns you the other thing about this woman and and this is important well let me get to that in a minute I want to talk about the way her students she's a teacher a professor I want to talk about the fact that the way her students reacted but first Cavanaugh's mother who was a circuit court judge once ruled against her parents that's something that may give her a grudge and finally she is a very left-wing Bernie supporting Democrat who donates the left-wing causes and has previously signed an open letter challenging Trump's border policy some people said for instance that well when she first talked about this it was 2012 and so Cavanaugh but she didn't mention Cavanaugh at the time it seems like so why would she say it then Cavanaugh wasn't going to be in the Supreme Court in 2012 but Mitt Romney said he would pick Cavanaugh - he put Cavanaugh a very high on his list so that she may have had a grudge against him political grudge against them too
