Donald Trump is criticizing Twitter and threatening to investigate the issue of shadow banning this is respond response to reporting by vice news indicating that Twitter's algorithms seem to hide the accounts of certain right-wingers if people search for their names on the site now here's what Donald Trump had to say about it Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans not good we will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once many complaints but it is true that there are many complaints because nothing that right-wing likes to do more than cry so they've been crying ever since the story came out I mainly don't believe it and I'll tell you why this happens every time oh my god i RS is investigating conservatives more oh my god let's all cry let's do hearings let's make sure that we take away money from the IRS so they can't catch rich people cheating on their taxes right and then you find out at the very end of the investigation just kidding they investigated liberals more than servers so now why says one story where they looked up a couple of people they looked up and to be fair to the people I'm sure that their methods were highly scientific and accurate and that they did like a full like blown investigation to ensure that everything that they're reporting is accurate about it and will give you Twitter's response in a second too but they looked up a couple of people and they say that they didn't show up in the search if their official profile and a couple conserves in a show of a couple of liberals did now my guess is people will do it all you know over and over again and after Ted Cruz's the stupid hearings on it which is probably coming up any time now right because they love to pounce on stuff like this someone will actually do a scientific study and realize they've probably banned liberals more so okay that's my guess because that's how almost every one of these stories goes out but more importantly look I know that everyone who uses social media thinks that the world revolves around them and that Twitter cares a lot about them and is watching like there's literate they think there's literally a person sitting at a desk who's just following them and tracking them at Twitter right that's not what's happening so everything on these social media accounts there's so many users guys come on be smarter than that they use an algorithm and guess what sometimes algorithms suck and what they do is try to use this technology to decipher whether or not certain accounts are following their guidelines and if you know the algorithm Flags someone's page because it appears to not follow its guidelines then look it's an issue if it's incorrect and it appears from this story that the algorithm was faulty and so Twitter has fixed it and I'm happy that they fixed it because I don't want you know prominent Republicans or prominent Democrats to be shadow bands simply for their political ideology but it has nothing to do with political ideology it has everything to do with them trying to balance the heat that they get for all the crazy people on Twitter right and then also you know make sure that they provide an open forum for well-meaning people who want to engage in political debate it's a difficult thing to do Twitter is I just look it by the way this applies to the right on the left I get it you don't like the social media right social media gets crazy people like cry and whine about social media all day thinking off of social media like these are private companies they are not obligated to do anything for you they're just not look I understand it but we can say something that the mainstream media cannot say mainstream media cannot tell you well there's a reason why sometimes right where's he a band more on Twitter or the shadow banning or whatever else is going on and I'm gonna give you both sides in a second just Twitter did admit to something and it's important you should know the whole story okay but the point that they leave out is because the right wing is much bigger douches they are they say terrible things on Twitter all the time look saying hideous things shirt that's bad I guess right but I don't have a problem with that people are gonna hold on people are gonna say hideous things what I do have a problem with is the smear campaigns that take place on Twitter that intentionally spread lies about people intentionally spreads propaganda about people defame people try to destroy people's lie fives you know what sort of itch tried to do with Sam cedar is a perfect example of that he's tried to do that with other individuals as well I mean look people took a picture of me and my husband okay and Photoshop Genk onto it and then started to spread it all over the Internet and it looked very realistic and it was terrible because you have family members who are like what is that is that real and it's an it's a way of trying to defame people and try to destroy their lives that goes on on Twitter and that is specifically done by right-wingers like cirno bitch so it's not an even playing field so when the mainstream media tell calls it 5015 goes oh our Republicans being discriminated against they're leaving out a giant context of the story which is that right-wingers on purpose make up lies photoshopped pictures and then spread it all across the internet and when occasionally social media catches them and says that violates our Terms of Service because you're lying they go oh my god you are discriminating against Republicans though they're discriminating against these they should block things that are lies things that are outrageous things that are abusive and by abusive I don't mean your opinion but when they personally attack people when they Doc's people and I don't mean attack like hey they call me a brown buffalo have at it Hoss right a thousand a million tweets about that I don't care that shouldn't be banned at all you think I'm terrible guy you think it√≠s eyes me in a hundred different ways that's fine but when you attack someone you know calling them all sorts of racial names as they did with the woman from Saturday and live and then on top of that you a layer in this is her house and you should do something well if social media is in an impossible spot either they do nothing and go yeah sure go ahead go see if you could be a herder right or you say well you monsters I can't allow you to do that I'm gonna be in legal trouble then they turn around and cry and cry and cry they're the biggest bitches in the world they're so pathetic and then they will pretend like for now labor who he said bitches I guarantee you they will cry about that as if they care these are the people who are writing pro rape tweets and they turn around and pretend they care about women so we don't have an even playing field so now let me give you just two piece of context that are important to this particular story twitter did say we are aware that some accounts are not automatically populating in our search box so I'm giving you the full context so Twitter said that is that is true that some are not populating the search box now we're looking to fix it we did fix it but is it based on bias so here's what Twitter product head Cavin a big pore said to be clear our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgments based on political views or the substance of tweets there's no there's no human being who's going around going I don't like Rhonda McDaniel who writes the runs the RNC and they did not program into the code of the algorithm discriminate against some Republicans but not others they don't and I gonna put that in an algorithm it would destroy the company right no and so what what they do explain is that they do focus sometimes on bad conduct as opposed to ideas okay so a lot of times that affects the right-wing more because they commit more bad conduct so and by the way if there was a people on the Left who are daxing people and saying go get him and hurt him we'd be a hundred percent against them and instead of doing what the right-wing does Oh Twitter's opposed against liberals what we would say is no that's unacceptable and you should ban that person but there are some people who are not great actors on the left it is nowhere near the mountain of awful hideous people in the right wing who do this on a regular basis and if you're not one of them then you don't have to cry then go do your criticism do your harsh criticism of me of anyone else but that's not what's happening here the only ones they take action against are the ones that actually endanger people an overwhelming majority of the time that's the right wing to easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe
