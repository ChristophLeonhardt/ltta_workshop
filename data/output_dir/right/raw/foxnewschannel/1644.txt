10
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:15,733
STARTED GOING SQUISHY ON THE

11
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,501
IDEA OF THE SUBJECT, BUT TODAY

12
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,236
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN A CHATTY

13
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:23,474
MOOD AND STILL OPTIMISTIC.

HIS JUNE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN

20
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,889
APPEARS TO BE STILL BE ON TRACK.

21
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:39,557
>> President Trump: NOTHING

22
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:40,291
HAS CHANGED ON NORTH KOREA THAT

23
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,892
WE KNOW OF.

24
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:43,694
WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ANYTHING,

25
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:45,863
AND IF IT DOES, THAT'S FINE.

26
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:48,165
IF IT DOESN'T, I THINK WE WILL

27
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:51,268

NORTH KOREAN DISARMAMENT.

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,317
THE LIBYA MODEL FROM 2003-2004.

37
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,319
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCES,

38
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,587
THE LIBYAN PROGRAM WAS MUCH

39
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:11,622
SMALLER, BUT THAT WAS BASICALLY

40
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:15,493
THE AGREEMENT THAT WE MADE.

41
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:16,861

00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:20,464
QUICK TO REMIND THE WORLD THAT

43
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:24,268
THE U.S. TURNED ON QADDAFI.

44
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:25,903
THE U.S. THREATENED TO OVERTHROW

45
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:26,637
QADDAFI WHO WAS LATER MURDERED

46
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,939
IN THE STREETS BY AN ANGRY MOB.

MODEL FOR NORTH KOREAN

00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:36,714
DISARMAMENT WILL BE MUCH

52
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:37,481
DIFFERENT THAN LIBYA.

53
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,382
>> President Trump: THE MODEL

54
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:40,084
ISN'T WHAT WE HAVE AT ALL WHEN

55
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,719
WE THINK OF NORTH KOREA.

56
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,921
IN LIBYA, WE DECIMATED THAT

57
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,321
COUNTRY.

58
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,524
WE NEVER SAID TO QADDAFI, WE ARE

59
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,526
GOING TO GIVE YOU PROTECTION, WE

60
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:52,263

DISMANTLING HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM,

64
00:01:57,068 --> 00:02:00,071
CAN LOOK AT GUARANTY'S.

65
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:00,871
ECONOMIC, SECURITY AND

66
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,238
POLITICAL.

67
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,139
>> President Trump: HE WOULD

68
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:04,141
BE RUNNING HIS COUNTRY, HIS

69
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,843
COUNTRY WOULD BE VERY RICH.

70
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,746
>> WHAT SECURITY GUARANTEES ARE

71
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:09,312

WILLING TO DO A LOT AND HE'S

74
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:13,918
WILLING TO DO A LOT, ALSO.

75
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:15,453
I THINK WE WILL HAVE A GOOD

76
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:16,387
RELATIONSHIP ASSUMING WE HAVE

77
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,988
THE MEETING AND SOMETHING COMES

78
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:18,322
OF IT.

79
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:21,726
HE WILL GET PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

80
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:22,126
VERY STRONG.

81
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:24,361
>> Reporter: BUT

82
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:29,700
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO WARNED THAT

83
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,337
THE IT COULD HAPPEN.

84
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:36,474
A DEAL, I THINK KIM JONG UN WILL

85
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:38,275
BE VERY, VERY HAPPY.

86
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,677
>> Reporter: PRESENT HAS

87
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:40,411
TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO REDUCE

88
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,846
THE SIZE OF THE U.S. PROTECTION

89
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:43,280
FORCE IN SOUTH KOREA COME DOWN

90
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,151
FROM THE CURRENT 28,500 TROOPS.

91
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:47,918
NORTH KOREA HAS LONG DEMANDED

92
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,588
THAT THE U.S. REMOVE TROOPS FROM

93
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:51,021
SOUTH KOREA.

94
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:51,922
TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD NOT

95
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,492
SAY IF THAT WAS ON THE TABLE.

96
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:55,493
>> President Trump: I'M NOT

97
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,294
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT, I WILL

98
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,163

99
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:00,064
ADEQUATE PROTECTION AND WE WILL

100
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:01,899
SEE HOW IT ALL TURNS OUT.

101
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,167
I THINK THIS, THE BEST THING HE

102
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,870
COULD EVER DO IS TO MAKE A DEAL.

103
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,739

PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO HIGHLIGHTED

106
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,109

108
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:15,913
