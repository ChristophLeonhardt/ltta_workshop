A YEAR AGO
TODAY 49 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN
THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO.
IT WAS THE UNITED STATES MOST
DEADLIEST KILLING EVER.
>> I MISS PULSE.
I MISS
EVERYTHING IT STOOD FOR.
I MISS
SERVING THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY
IN A WAY THAT ONLY A GAY BAR
CAN.
I AM GRATEFUL AND COMFORTED
WHEN I SEE YOUR PICTURES OF THE
BEST TIMES OF YOUR LIVES.
IT BREAKS MY HEART THAT YOUR
SANCTUARY WAS
TAKEN FROM YOU, BUT I KNOW WE
ARE RESILIENT AND I KNOW WE
WILL NOT LET HATE WIN.
>> THAT WAS EXTREMELY MOVING.
SHE ALSO HELD A MEMORIAL SERVICE
AT 
THE NIGHTCLUB.
YOU CAN SEE
HERE A PICTURE OF THE LARGE
GROUP THAT MADE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE
THE CLUB.
PULSE HAS BEEN BOARDED
UP SINCE THE EVENT LAST YEAR.
THE SHOOTING LAST YEAR WAS
DEVASTATING BUT IT WAS NOT THE
ONLY TIME THAT THE LGBTQ
COMMUNITY FACED A VIOLENT
BACKLASH.
LAST 
YEAR WAS ACTUALLY
THE DEADLIEST YEAR FOR MEMBERS
OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY.
THIS IS
A TIME WHEN WE ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE MORE TOLERANT AND ACCEPTING,
AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE AND SAD
THAT WE ARE STILL FACING THESE
HATE CRIMES.
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE
WITH THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY
ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS WHITES
AND ABLE BODIES TO BE THE
VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT.
JUNE IS
PRIDE MONTH, THAT IS WHY THE
ATTACKER TARGETED PULSE THAT
NIGHT.
AS A WAY TO REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED I LIKE THAT SHE IS
COMING OUT AND SAYING THAT SHE
WILL MAKE A MUSEUM AND
MEMORIAL FOR THOSE MEMBERS
THAT PASSED AWAY.
>> I WENT BY THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB
A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT IS WEIRD.
I
WAS ON MY WAY TO A PORT TO CATCH
A BOAT.
IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT,
MAYBE 11 OR MIDNIGHT.
WHILE
BOARDED UP IT WAS SURROUNDED BY
FLOWERS AND A LIVING MEMORIAL AS
TO WHAT HAPPEN THERE.
THAT
COMMUNITY IS STILL VERY
CONNECTED TO THAT PLACE AND
REMEMBERING THAT HISTORY.
THE
OTHER THING THAT STRIKES ME IS
THAT THIS IS A TIME WHEN THE
LGBTQ COMMUNITY IS ñ
NOW WE FIND OURSELVES IN A
SITUATION WHERE THE COMMUNITY
IS ON THE DEFENSIVE A BIT.
>> I THINK MEMBERS OF THAT
COMMUNITY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON
THE DEFENSIVE.
I THINK THAT IS
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE
REPORTING, OR LACK THEREOF.
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WITH PULSE
WE SEE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED,
EVEN IN CERTAIN PRIDE MARCHES WE
STILL SEE LGBTQ FOLKS TO
DE-CENTER WHITENESS, DESPITE THE
FACT THAT INSTANCES OF VIOLENCE
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT PEOPLE
OF COLOR AND FOLKS WHO ARE NOT
ABLE-BODIED OR ARE DIFFERENT.
I THINK THAT IS 
KIND OF
WHAT THE RECORD OR REPORT IS
GETTING AT.
I THINK IF WE HAVE
MORE COVERAGE WE ALSO FORCE A
CONVERSATION AROUND SEXUAL
IDENTITY, RACE AND THINGS THAT
WE NEED TO TALK TO ABOUT.
>> I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THERE IS A CONVERSATION BUT ON
THE WRONG SIDE.
TRUMP IS PASSING
THESE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY
EXECUTIVE ORDERS.
HE IS ALSO NOT
PROTECTING PEOPLE OF COLOR, AND
THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY,
DISABLED PEOPLE ñ THERE IS SO
MUCH OF THIS RHETORIC OUT THERE
THAT I THINK THERE IS MORE OF AN
ACCEPTANCE FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST
THEM OR HATE SPEECH AGAINST
PEOPLE WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES
THAN EVER BEFORE.
WE NEED TO SHIFT IT BACK TO
TOLERANCE AND ACCEPTANCE.
>> BUT THOSE LEGISLATIVE
ROLLBACKS ARE SIGNIFICANT.
IT IS
NOT JUST THE RHETORIC, IT'S THE
FACT THAT THEY ARE REALLY
ROLLING BACK LEGISLATIVE GAINS.
THIS IS A TURNING POINT.
BECAUSE
OF THE RHETORIC AND THOSE MOVES
YOU NEED TO HAVE ANY KIND OF
DIALOGUE OR CONVERSATION, AND IT
IS HARDER TO HAVE IT.
I AM
ACTUALLY EMBARRASSED TO SAY I
HAVEN'T EVEN CONSIDERED THAT
WITHIN AN OPPRESSED COMMUNITY
THERE IS EVEN A MORE OPPRESSED
COMMUNITY.
THERE IS A LOT THAT
IS NEGATIVE AT THIS MOMENT IN
TIME.
