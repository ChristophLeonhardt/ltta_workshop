ABBY: WELCOME BACK. THE PRESIDENT EXPECTED TO TOUCH DOWN IN SINGAPORE WITHIN THE HOUR. AND HIS WEEKEND ABROAD APPEARS TO BE SENDING THE MEDIA INTO A BIT OF A MELTDOWN. HERE TO BREAK IT ALL DOWN, DISTRICT MEDIA GROUP PRESIDENT AND HERITAGE FOUNDATION PRESIDENT BEVERLY HALBURG. GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON WITH US. THANK YOU. ABBY: ALL RIGHT, OF COURSE HE HAD LEFT THE G7 SUMMIT BEFORE HE LANDS THERE IN SINGAPORE, WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOME IMAGES THAT HAVE GONE VIRAL. FIRST, THE IMAGE OF TRUMP AND EMMANUEL MACRON IN THIS HANDSHAKE. THERE WERE A LOT OF THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE, A FIRM GRIP. HERE'S ONE TWEET FROM THE MANAGING EDITOR AT POLITICO'S USA: MACRON OWNS TRUMP WITH G7 DEATH GRIP HANDSHAKE. YOUR RESPONSE. WELL, LET'S NOT FORGET THEY HAVE WHAT MANY CALL A BROMANCE WHEN MACRON DID COME TO THE UNITED STATES IN APRIL FOR THE FIRST STATE DINNER UNDER THE PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESIDENCY. THERE WAS LOTS OF HANDSHAKES AND HUGS. SO I THINK THIS HANDSHAKE PHOTO IS HOW THE RELATIONSHIP'S CHANGED. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN THIS MEETING WAS COME IN, BE STRONG, BE VERY PRO-AMERICA. I THINK A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES DISAGREE WITH HIM ON TARIFFS, BUT I THINK HE WANTED TO ASSERT WHAT HE THINKS THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE IN WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE DEALS. AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF OUR ALLIES, NOT ALL OF THEM TOOK KINDLY TO THAT. ABBY: YEAH. WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH FUN ON SOCIAL MEDIA THESE DAYS WITH THESE PHOTOS OF THESE IMPORTANT MEETINGS. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE, PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH ANGELA MERKEL. EVERYONE HAS SEEN THIS PICTURE BY NOW, SHE'S BASICALLY STARING HIM DOWN. WHO KNOWS, BEVERLY, WHAT WAS ACTUALLY GOING ON IN THAT MOMENT. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN A FLY ON THE WALL AND ALSO KNOW WHAT SHINZO ABE WAS THINKING. BUT HERE'S A TWEET: ANGELA MERKEL'S OFFICE HAS RELEASED THIS PHOTO TAKEN TODAY AT THE G7 WHICH TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW THINGS WENT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? A PICTURE CAN SPEAK A THOUSAND WORDS. I THINK IT'S A VERY POWERFUL IMAGE, LIKE YOU SAID. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING, BUT THE BODY LANGUAGE IS FASCINATING. YOU HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED, ANGELA MERKEL KIND OF PEERING OVER HIM IN A VERY OMINOUS WAY. AND I THINK THIS SHOWS PERFECTLY THE TENSION THAT WAS AT THIS MEETING. I WILL SAY ONE OF THE MOST POSITIVE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF IT, SOMETHING THAT I HOPE DOES HAPPEN IS THAT THE PRESIDENT DID SAY THAT HE WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE TARIFF-FREE AND FREE TRADE. THAT IS A GOOD THING. ABBY: SO HE DID Q&A AT THE END, THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING PARTS OF THE SUMMIT, AND HE CALLS OUT A REPORTER THE PRESIDENT DOES AND IS ASKS THEM WHO ARE THEY REPORTING FOR. WATCH THIS. THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THE AMERICAN ALLIES WERE FRUSTRATED AND THAT YOU'RE LEAVING HERE TO GO MEET FOR FRIENDLIER TALKS WITH KIM JONG UN IN SINGAPORE, AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU VIEW IT WHO ARE YOU WITH, OUT OF CURIOSITY? IS. CNN. I FIGURED. FAKE NEWS CNN. THE WORST. ABBY: BEVERLY? WELL, THE TERM FAKE NEWS HAS PLAYED WELL FOR HIM. HE'S CONTINUING WITH THAT. SO I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT AS HE MOVES TO NORTH KOREA THOUGH WE CAN GET OFF CALLING CNN FAKE NEWS FOR NOW AND GET TO SOME AGREEMENTS, BUT IT'S ALWAYS ENTERTAINING WHEN HE DOES IT. ABBY: YEAH, IT IS. AN IMPORTANT COUPLE DAYS TO GO,
