1
00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:02,386
TO HIM.

2
00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:04,255
>> Bill: BEN HALL IN ISTANBUL.

3
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:08,025
>> Sandra: LET'S GO TO OUR

4
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:09,226
HEADLINER NEWT GINGRICH FORMER

5
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:11,095
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND FOX

6
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:11,595
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

7
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:12,863
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

8
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:13,764
PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THIS

9
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:17,201
SITUATION WITH SAUDI ARABIA?

10
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:21,005
>> WELL, I THINK HE IS IN A

11
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:22,206
DIFFICULT SITUATION BECAUSE THE

12
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:23,140
IRANIANS, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD

13
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:24,976
LOVE FOR US TO SEPARATE

14
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,911
OURSELVES FROM SAUDI ARABIA.

15
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:28,646
BUT THE ISRAELIS AND OTHERS ALL

16
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:30,648
REALIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY,

17
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,316
VERY IMPORTANT ALLY OF OURS.

18
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:35,786
I THINK THE STEP ONE IS EXACTLY

19
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:36,587
WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO IS DOING.

20
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:38,622
WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

21
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:38,923
THIS.

22
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:40,758
IF IT DOES TURN OUT TO BE

23
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,926
SOMEBODY VERY CLOSE TO THE

24
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:43,561
CROWN PRINCE, I THINK THE CROWN

25
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:45,296
PRINCE WILL BE IN VERY

26
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:45,830
SUBSTANTIAL TROUBLE.

27
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:47,865
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE

28
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:48,599
GOING TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH

29
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,434
SAUDI ARABIA BUT IT DOES MEAN

30
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,738
WE'LL FIND WAYS TO TAKE STEPS

31
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,106
TO COMMUNICATE VERY INTENSELY

32
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:58,009
THAT WE JUST DON'T ACCEPT THIS

33
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,512
WHEN THE RUSSIANS POISON PEOPLE

34
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:04,982
IN BRITAIN AND WE WOULD NOT

35
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,685
ACCEPT IT IF THE SAUDIS KILLED

36
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:08,953
A JOURNALIST IN TURKEY.

37
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:10,488
STEP ONE TO GET THE FACTS.

38
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,256
THEY'RE WORKING AT IT.

39
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:13,657
SECRETARY POMPEO GOT A STRONG

40
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:14,125
PLEDGE.

41
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:15,526
WE'LL SEE IF THE SAUDIS FOLLOW

42
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:17,328
THROUGH.

43
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,264
>> Bill: AND WHAT POMPEO SAYS

44
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:21,565
WHEN HE COMES BACK.

45
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:22,733
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MID-TERMS.

46
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:26,604
THERE IS A PIECE OUT THERE

47
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:28,406
ABOUT REPUBLICANS GETTING

48
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:30,508
PRETTY TAKEN ON THE MONEY SIDE.

49
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,675
THERE IS SOME OTHER STORIES

50
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,811
THAT COUNTER AND SAY THE RNC IS

51
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:34,645
DOING JUST FINE.

52
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:39,216
WHERE DO YOU SEE AT THE MOMENT

53
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:42,319
US GOING ON NOVEMBER 7th?

54
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,589
>> LET ME JUST WARN THAT ALL OF

55
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,757
THE SO-CALLED EXPERTS ON

56
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,392
TELEVISION WHO WERE WRONG IN

57
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:49,560
2016 ARE BACK THIS YEAR AS

58
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:50,961
CONFIDENT AS THEY WERE WHEN

59
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:54,598
THEY WERE TOTALLY WRONG IN 2016.

60
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,734
NANCY PELOSI YESTERDAY GAVE THE

61
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:57,668
REPUBLICANS THE GREATEST GIFT

62
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,770
SHE COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM.

63
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,872
HER QUOTES AT HARVARD IN WHICH

64
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,442
SHE EXPLAINED YOU DON'T REALLY

65
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:04,875
NEED BORDERS.

66
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,577
AFTER ALL, YOU OUGHT TO BE

67
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:07,244
FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE AND

68
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,380
WANTING TO HAVE A WALL IS A

69
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:09,814
MACHO THING.

70
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:12,183
THAT IS AS CLEAR A STATEMENT OF

71
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:14,285
THE INSANITY OF THE OPEN

72
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:16,153
BORDERS DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS WE

73
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:17,321
COULD POSSIBLY GET.

74
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,956
AND WHEN COMBINED WITH SENATOR

75
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:20,858
FEINSTEIN, BOTH OF THEM OF

76
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:21,826
COURSE FROM SAN FRANCISCO,

77
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:23,894
HAVING INTRODUCED A BILL IN THE

78
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,763
SENATE FOR OPEN BORDERS,

79
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:27,164
SUPPORTED BY THE WAY

80
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:27,898
CO-SPONSORED BY EVERY SINGLE

81
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:33,270
DEMOCRAT IN THE SENATE.

82
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:37,408
I THINK IF THAT'S OUR CHOICE --

83
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,311
I THINK THAT WE HAVE A -- I

84
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:44,448
THINK WE HAVE A VERY REAL

85
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:45,616
CHANCE HERE.

86
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:47,485
>> Bill: I THINK YOU'RE HEARING

87
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:49,420
SOMETHING ELSE IN YOUR EAR.

88
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:51,755
>> IF THE REPUBLICANS DOUBLE

89
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:54,325
DOWN AND FOCUS ON KEVIN

90
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:55,493
McCARUTHERS EAR'S BILL TO ALLOW

91
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:57,161
US TO CONTROL THE BORDER AND

92
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,964
COMPARE THAT WITH THE

93
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:00,698
PELOSI/FEINSTEIN POSITION OF

94
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,066
TOTALLY OPEN BORDERS AT A TIME

95
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,934
WHEN YOU HAVE A CARAVAN OF

96
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,569
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING OUT

97
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,771
OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND THEN THE

98
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,406
AMERICAN CITIZENS CAN DECIDE DO

99
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,876
YOU WANT SANCTUARY CITIES?

100
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:14,178
YOU WANT MS-13?

101
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:16,080
YOU WANT FENTANYL AND OPIOIDS

102
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,715
AND AN UNENDING FLOOD OF

103
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:20,718
IMMIGRANTS FROM ALL OVER THE

104
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,051
PLANET?

105
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:21,519
VOTE DEMOCRAT.

106
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,853
AND ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU

107
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,955
THINK AMERICA HAS THE RIGHT TO

108
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:25,656
CONTROL ITS BORDER, VOTE

109
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:26,123
REPUBLICAN.

110
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,758
>> Sandra: IT SOUNDS LIKE

111
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,161
THAT'S THE ISSUE THE PRESIDENT

112
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:32,029
IS PUSHING AT THIS MOMENT.

113
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,664
CONSIDERING THE LAST TWO TWEETS

114
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:35,766
FROM HIM HAVE BEEN ON THAT

115
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,635
TALKING ABOUT THOSE CARAVANS

116
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:39,637
SAYING DEMOCRATS WON'T APPROVE

117
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:40,905
LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS LAWS

118
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:42,773
FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR

119
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:43,240
COUNTRY.

120
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,109
GREAT MID-TERM ISSUE FOR

121
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,809
REPUBLICANS.

122
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,678
MOMENTS AGO HE SAYS REPUBLICANS

123
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,547
MUST MAKE THE HORRENDOUS WEAK

124
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:50,347
AND OUTDATED IMMIGRATION LAWS

125
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:52,583
AND BORDER A PART OF THE

126
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:53,317
MID-TERMS.

127
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:57,588
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE LATEST PUSH.

128
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:58,756
>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

129
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:00,891
WHEN YOU SAY TO THE AVERAGE

130
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:03,761
AMERICAN WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC

131
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:05,229
CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR STACY

132
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,397
ABRAMS IN GEORGIA WHO BASICALLY

133
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:08,299
WOULD MAKE ALL THE GEORGIA A

134
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,233
SANCTUARY STATE.

135
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:11,602
YOU HAVE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR

136
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:12,336
IN CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRAT WHO

137
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,805
SAID HE WANTS TO HAVE UNIVERSAL

138
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:15,606
HEALTHCARE PAID BY THE

139
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,107
GOVERNMENT AND WANTS IT TO

140
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,109
APPLY TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

141
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,144
THAT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA THE

142
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:21,244
MAGNET FOR THE PLANET.

143
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,113
IF YOU HAVE A SICKNESS MOVE TO

144
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:24,048
CALIFORNIA AND THEY'LL TAKE

145
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:24,648
CARE OF YOU.

146
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,417
THIS IS A CORE CHOICE.

147
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:28,052
IS AMERICA A COUNTRY THAT HAS

148
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:29,954
THE RIGHT TO PROTECT ITSELF AND

149
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:33,023
TO DEFINE WHO COMES IN, OR IS

150
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,992
AMERICA NOW GOING TO BE JUST AN

151
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:36,227
OPEN SYSTEM WHERE EVERYBODY ON

152
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:37,494
THE PLANET CAN COME HERE?

153
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,129
THAT'S HOW BIG THE CHOICE IS

154
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,531
GOING TO BE BY ELECTION DAY.

155
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:41,966
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS WILL LOSE

156
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,601
THAT DEBATE BY A HUGE MARGIN.

157
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:50,741
>> Bill: LET'S GO TO TRISH

158
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:52,142
REGAN'S INTERVIEW WITH THE

159
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:52,710
PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT.

160
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,245
THE SOUND BITE FROM THE

161
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:55,379
PRESIDENT AND AN A.P. QUOTE AS

162
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,679
WELL.

163
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,082
>> President Trump: I THINK

164
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,583
WE'LL DO REALLY WELL.

165
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:02,052
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE

166
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:02,453
PREDICTIONS.

167
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:05,055
WE HAVE GREAT POLL NUMBERS AND

168
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,290
TREMENDOUS TURN-OUTS AT THE

169
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:06,624
RALLIES.

170
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,325
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MORE THAN

171
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:11,161
WE CAN HOLD.

172
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,063
ENTHUSIASM LIKE WE HAD AT 2016,

173
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,932
THE LAST ELECTION.

174
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:15,833
QUITE A SPECTACULAR DAY AND

175
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:16,166
EVENING.

176
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,202
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF

177
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:18,602
ENTHUSIASM.

178
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:21,171
I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE

179
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:22,406
ENTHUSIASM, THE BLUE WAVE.

180
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:26,477
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TREMENDOUS

181
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:26,944
ENTHUSIASM.

182
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:29,280
>> Bill: HE WILL BE IN MONTANA,

183
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,615
NEVADA AND ARIZONA THIS WEEK.

184
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,251
IF DEMOCRATS WIN THE HOUSE, IF

185
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,920
NANCY PELOSI IS SPEAKER, HOW

186
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,055
MUCH HAVE YOU STOPPED TO

187
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:39,723
CONSIDER HOW THIS PRESIDENT

188
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:40,424
WOULD WORK WITH DEMOCRATIC

189
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:41,458
LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE?

190
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,227
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?

191
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:45,396
>> HOW DO YOU WORK WITH A

192
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:50,234
PERSON THAT SAYS SHE WANTS TO

193
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:51,802
IMPEACH YOU, WHO DESPISES

194
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:54,004
EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR, AND

195
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,472
WHO REPRESENTS A SAN FRANCISCO

196
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:57,274
HARD LEFT WORLDVIEW IN A PARTY

197
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,709
WHICH IS BECOMING THE SOCIALIST

198
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,209
PARTY OF AMERICA?

199
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,446
I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY

200
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:02,880
CONTENTIOUS --

201
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:03,847
>> Bill: GRIDLOCK?

202
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:05,649
>> ON THE HOUSE SIDE.

203
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,117
ON THE SENATE SIDE THE

204
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,453
REPUBLICANS WILL GAIN SENATE

205
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:09,753
SEATS.

206
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:10,988
I THINK KEVIN MCCARTHY'S BILL

207
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,489
IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE

208
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,657
RIGHT DIRECTION TO CONTROL OUR

209
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:13,991
BORDERS.

210
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,759
I THINK THE ODDS ARE

211
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,360
INCREASINGLY GOOD THE

212
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:18,329
REPUBLICANS WILL KEEP THEIR

213
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,431
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND I

214
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:21,598
WENT THROUGH THIS IN 2016.

215
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,767
I WAS ON A SHOW TWO WEEKS TO

216
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,269
THE DAY BEFORE SOMEBODY SAID TO

217
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,603
ME IF YOU LOSE THE SENATE AND

218
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:27,771
YOU LOSE THE PRESIDENCY DID YOU

219
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,340
PICK THE WRONG GUY?

220
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,909
I SAID WE'RE TWO WEEKS OUT AND

221
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,776
YOU ARE ASSUMING?

222
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:34,712
I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW ON THE

223
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:35,913
ISSUES, REPUBLICANS HAVE A

224
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:38,482
CHANCE TO HAVE A HISTORIC

225
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,416
ELECTION NIGHT.

226
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,453
KEEP THE HOUSE, INCREASE THE

227
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:43,654
SENATE AND HAVE THE DEFENDANT

228
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:44,321
TOTALLY SHOCKED.

229
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,489
>> Sandra: THE PRESIDENT IS

230
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,358
ALREADY PREPARING FOR IF THE

231
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,625
REPUBLICANS DO LOSE THE HOUSE

232
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:50,661
HE SAYS IT WON'T BE ON ME.

233
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:55,499
HERE HE IS IN AN A.P. INTERVIEW.

234
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,066
IT'S A QUOTE.

235
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,935
HERE IS WHAT HE SAYS ON THAT.

236
00:06:57,936 --> 00:06:59,803
IT'S A TOUGH YEAR, THE

237
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:00,938
MID-TERMS ARE TOUGH FOR

238
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,506
EVERYBODY OPPOSITE OF PRESIDENT

239
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:03,807
FOR WHATEVER REASON NOBODY HAS

240
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:07,444
BEEN ABLE TO SAY.

241
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,079
A.P. ASKS THE QUESTION IF

242
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,747
REPUBLICANS WERE TO LOSE

243
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:12,349
CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OR A

244
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,517
COUPLE DAYS LATER DEPENDING HOW

245
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,685
LONG IT TAKES TO COUNT THE

246
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:16,186
VOTES DO YOU BELIEVE YOU WEAR

247
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,488
SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT?

248
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,123
HE SAID NO, I THINK I'M HELPING

249
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:19,456
PEOPLE.

250
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:21,759
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

251
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,094
>> FIRST OF ALL THE PRESIDENT

252
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,963
CAME OUT AND POINTED OUT THE

253
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:27,631
A.P. HEADLINE WAS TOTALLY WRONG

254
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:28,332
AND MISLEADING.

255
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,200
WHAT HE SAID IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

256
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,069
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY PRESIDENT

257
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,937
WHO HAS CAMPAIGNED HARDER AND

258
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,672
HE IS ADDING MORE RALLIES BY

259
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:36,039
THE DAY.

260
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,175
I THINK HE WILL HAVE GOTTEN TO

261
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,544
50 RALLIES BY THE TIME OF THE

262
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:40,911
ELECTION.

263
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:44,982
SO HE IS DOING HIS JOB.

264
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,417
HE HAS ALSO RAISED A TREMENDOUS

265
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:47,117
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

266
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:48,018
HE IS DOING HIS JOB.

267
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,586
NOW THE CANDIDATES HAVE TO DO

268
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:50,154
THEIR JOBS.

269
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:52,723
IT IS FAIR FOR HIM TO SAY, YOU

270
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:55,793
KNOW, IT'S NOT -- THIS IS NOT

271
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:57,194
PURELY A REFERENDUM ON TRUMP

272
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,929
BUT THE PREMISE IS WRONG.

273
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,899
I WOULD NOT UNTIL -- I WOULD

274
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,101
NOT CONCEDE LOSING THE HOUSE

275
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:05,569
FOR ONE MINUTE.

276
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,204
I THINK THAT WE HAVE -- I THINK

277
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:10,507
WE HAVE THE ISSUES ON OUR SIDE,

278
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:13,510
JOBS VERSUS MOBS, RESULTS

279
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:15,712
VERSUS RESISTANCE, CONSERVATIVE

280
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:17,347
JUDGES VERSUS RADICALS, AND

281
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:18,782
CONTROLLING THE BORDER VERSUS

282
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:19,216
OPEN BORDERS.

283
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:21,452
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A

284
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:22,820
VERY SURPRISING ELECTION NIGHT.

285
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:25,189
>> Bill: HE WENT ON TO TWEET

286
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:25,656
ABOUT THAT.

287
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:27,758
>> BY THE WAY, AT THAT POINT IF

288
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,293
WE KEEP THE HOUSE, IF WE KEEP

289
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:30,327
THE HOUSE DOES "THE NEW YORK

290
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:31,929
TIMES" HAVE TO SAY THAT TRUMP

291
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,597
WON?

292
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,032
>> Bill: GUESS SO.

293
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:39,503
STAND BY FOR THAT.

294
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:40,671
A.P. HEADLINE WAS DIFFERENT

295
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:41,271
FROM MY QUOTE.

296
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,240
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.

297
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:43,707
FAKE NEWS.

298
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:46,610
HOW MUCH IS A TRUMP REFERENDUM?

299
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:48,145
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT REALLY

300
00:08:48,146 --> 00:08:50,581
IS ABOUT HIM?

301
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:52,216
>> I THINK LESS THAN PEOPLE

302
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:54,084
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TWO MONTHS

303
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:54,351
AGO.

304
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:56,153
THE ISSUES ARE INCREASINGLY

305
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:56,520
IMPORTANT.

306
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:57,688
THE COUNTRY UNDERSTANDS ON THE

307
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:00,858
KAVANAUGH FIGHT AND THE WAY IN

308
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,227
WHICH NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS

309
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:05,562
LIED ABOUT, SMEARED, HAD

310
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:06,497
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, THE

311
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:08,599
CHILDISH BEHAVIOR OF THE

312
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,438
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, THE

313
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,372
IMAGERY OF LEFT WING RADICALS

314
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:17,441
SCRATCHING AT THE DOORS OF THE

315
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:18,876
SUPREME COURT.

316
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:20,978
IT HAS GALVANIZED THE COUNTRY

317
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:26,049
AND MADE  THE ISSUE BIGGER.

318
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,150
WHICH KIND OF AMERICA DO YOU

319
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,453
WANT?

320
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:30,254
I WAS JUST?

321
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,722
SEATTLE, DALLAS, DES MOINES.

322
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:33,457
PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE

323
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:33,790
COUNTRY.

324
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,858
THEY JUST WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT

325
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:35,325
THE PRESIDENT.

326
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,094
THEY WERE MORE FIRED UP THAN I

327
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:38,428
EVER REMEMBER SEEING THEM.

328
00:09:38,429 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Bill: INTERESTING.
