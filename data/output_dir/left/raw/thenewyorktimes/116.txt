2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,576
This is Gus Van Sant.

3
00:00:01,576 --> 00:00:02,950
I’m the director
of “Don’t Worry,

4
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,930
He Won’t Get Far on Foot."

5
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,760
This is our character
John Callahan

6
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,170
played by Joaquin Phoenix.

7
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,590
In the story, he’s had
a catastrophic accident,

8
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,250
and now he’s given an
electric wheelchair.

9
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,540
So now, this is the cure-all
to his motion problems.

10
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,030
I think in the screenplay
there was suggestion

11
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,940
that there would be,
like, a series of shots

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,060
that were related to his first
time working a wheelchair.

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,820
On the set, the
day we shot it,

14
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,750
we had gotten into the habit
of very loosely interpreting

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,290
the script.

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,310
I think it was more
we had a long lens,

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,620
we had the shots
in our head, we

18
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,420
had by then decided to use the
zoom lens a lot in the film.

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,580
So we were like zooming
in, zooming into wheels,

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,460
zooming into the joystick,
zooming into his face,

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,000
zooming out again.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,290
But a lot of
what’s going on is

23
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,810
Joaquin, himself, wanted
to act as if he’d never

24
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,950
used the wheelchair before.

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,800
So he was doing a lot of the
revalatory parts himself,

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,080
and we were basically
just capturing it.

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,900
We had a number of
different things

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,270
that we could do
with the wheelchair.

29
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,190
We could put the camera
on the wheelchair,

30
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,980
and we had a kind
of rickshaw as well.

31
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,020
And we had a skateboard
and we had a slider

32
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,990
and we had a spinner that
could spin the camera around.

33
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,000
And it was in a wheel that
could make it go in a circle

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,890
on the axis of its lens,
so that it was sort

35
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,660
of spinning on that axis.

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,100
The revelation of a thing
that can actually take you out

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,820
of your confinement in the way
that it does with motorized

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,160
wheels was a big moment.

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:00:00,000
