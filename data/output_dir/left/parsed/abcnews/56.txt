NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR 
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST 
SPOKEN WITH REPORTERS.
A PACKED DAY IN THE CAPITAL, 
JUST TWO HOURS AFTER A NORTH 
KOREAN LAUNCH OF 
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 
MISSILE, THE THIRD EVER LAUNCHED
FROM NORTH KOREA.
600 MILES TOWARDS JAPAN.
THE PRESIDENT EXPECTED TO 
ADDRESS THAT JUST MOMENTS AGO.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD, AND 
SOME OF YOU HAVE REPORTED, A 
MISSILE WAS LAUNCHED A LITTLE 
WHILE AGO FROM NORTH KOREA.
I WILL ONLY TELL YOU THAT WE 
WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.
WE HAVE GENERAL WITH US AND 
WE'VE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ON 
IT.
IT IS A SITUATION THAT WE WILL 
HANDLE.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, CHUCK 
SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI DID NOT
SHOW UP FOR OUR MEETING TODAY.
I'M NOT REALLY THAT SURPRISED.
WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES.
THEY ARE WEAK ON CRIME.
THEY ARE WEAK ON ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION.
THEY WANT THE ILLEGAL FOLKS THAT
COME POURING INTO OUR BORDER AND
A LOT OF PROBLEMS BEING CAUSED, 
ALTHOUGH WE'VE STOPPED IT TO A 
LARGE EXTENT, AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
WITHOUT THE WALL, WHICH WE'RE 
GOING TO GET.
THEY BEFORE THIS MEETING AND 
BEFORE THIS MISSILE LAUNCH, THEY
HAVE BEEN WEAK ON MILITARY IN 
TERMS OF SPENDING AND VERY HARD 
TO GET THE MILITARY FOR A LOT OF
OTHER THINGS.
MILITARY IS SECONDARY TO THEM, 
NOT TO ME.
FOR ONE THING, WE WON'T BE HERE 
WITHOUT OUR MILITARY.
WE'RE BUILDING STRONGER, BIGGER,
BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.
GENERAL MATTIS CAN TESTIFY TO 
THEY WANT TAX INCREASES AND WE 
WANT MAJOR TAX DECREASES SO THEY
DECIDED NOT TO SHELL UP.
THEY'VE BEEN ALL TALK AND NO 
ACTION.
AND NOW IT'S EVEN WORSE.
NOW IT'S NOT EVEN TALK.
SO THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP FOR 
THE MEETING.
IN LIGHT OF THE MISSILE LAUNCH, 
THEY'LL PROBABLY BE HERE FAIRLY 
QUICKLY OR AT LEAST DISCUSSIONS 
WILL AT LEAST START TAKING PLACE
FAIRLY QUICKLY.
I THINK THAT WE'RE IN A VERY 
GOOD POSITION IN TERMS OF THE 
MEETING.
WE JUST HAD OVER AT THE CAPITAL 
WITH THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
THAT WAS OUTSTANDING.
I THINK WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 
SUPPORT AND INFORMED BY MITCH 
THAT WE HAD A UNANIMOUS VOTE 
FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, AT 
LEAST.
WE HAD A VOTE ON THE 
TAX BILL AND I THINK IT'S GOING 
TO PASS AND GOING TO BE VERY 
POPULAR AND LOTS OF ADJUSTMENTS 
BEFORE IT ENDS BUT THE END 
RESULT WOULD BE A VERY, VERY 
MASSIVE, THE LARGEST IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY TAX CUT 
AND LOTS OF GOOD THINGS ARE 
GOING TO HAPPEN INCLUDING 
BRINGING BACK TO OUR COUNTRY OF 
PROBABLY END UP BEING OVER $4 
TRILLION, MONEY OFFSHORE THAT'S 
STAGNANT THAT COMPANIES AND JUST
NOT ABLE TO BRING IT BACK, SO I 
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A NUMBER 
OVER  4 TRILLION DOLLARS.
IF YOU LOOK AT CHINA AND SO MANY
OTHER COUNTRIES, MANY OTHER 
COUNTRIES, CHINA IS AT 15%.
THEY'RE LOWER THAN US, A LEVEL 
EITHER LOWER OR RIGHT IN THE 
BALLPARK SO THAT WE COULD 
COMPETE MUCH BETTER WITH OUR 
COMPANIES, OUR GREAT, GREAT 
COMPANIES AND THAT MEANS JOBS, 
THAT MEANS LOTS OF OTHER THINGS.
I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LEVEL IS 
JUST ABOUT THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER
BEEN.
IN FACT, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE 
ANY MISTAKES IN FRONT OF THE 
PRESS BUT YOU'LL GET ME ON IT 
BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IT'S THE 
HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN.
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PEOPLE 
LEADING THEIR COUNTRY.
AND I WILL SAY THAT I THINK IT'S
GOING TO GO BETTER AND BETTER 
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS VOTE 
ON TAXES WHICH ARE REALLY TAX 
CUTS AND REFORM IS GOING TO BE 
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.
SO WE HAD A GOOD DAY TODAY.
WE HAD A PHENOMENAL MEETING WITH
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS.
WE HAD, VERY SPECIAL THAT 
MEETING.
I WISH YOU COULD BE INSIDE THAT 
ROOM.
IT WAS VERY SPECIAL.
THE CAMARADERIE.
IT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A LOVEFEST.
THEY WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN.
NOT ONLY FOR THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY.
I THINK MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
THEY WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN FOR 
THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY KNOW 
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.
FOR US TO COMPETE AND WIN AND 
WITH THAT, I MAYBE WILL START 
WITH PAUL RYAN TO SAY A FEW 
WORDS ABOUT WHERE WE STAND WITH 
DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEN MITCH 
McCONNELL.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE 
SPEAKING TO REPORTERS IN THE 
ROOSEVELT ROOM ON A NUMBER OF OF
ISSUES THAT BROKE TODAY 
INCLUDING THE NORTH KOREA 
MISSILE TEST AND THEN THE 
RESPONSE TO THE SENATE TAX 
COMMITTEE WITH THE BILL GOING TO
THE SENATE FLOOR NOW AND THE 
EMPTY SEATS NEXT TO HIM FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN THE HOUSE 
AND SENATE, CHUCK SCHUMER AND 
NANCY PELOSI CHOSE NOT TO GO TO 
THE MEETING LOOMING THE SHUTDOWN
AFTER THE TAUNTING TWEET FROM 
THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING.
MARTHA WITH MORE ON THE THIRD 
EVER ICBM TEST FROM THE NORTH 
KOREANS.
THE FIRST ONE IN TWO MONTHS.
A RELATIVELY MEASURED RESPONSE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT. 
>> CERTAINLY SOMETIMES HE 
DOESN'T RESPOND AT ALL AND OTHER
TIMES, WITH STATEMENTS CALLING 
FOR FIRE ANDIN THE SPOT AND THI 
THIRD MISSILE TRAVELED FARTHER 
INTO SPACE THAN ANY OF THE TWO 
PRIOR ONES AND ALTHOUGH, IT WAS 
FLYING FOR A LONGER AMOUNT OF 
TIME, ABOUT 50 MINUTES, THIS 
ALSO FOLLOWS CHINA SENDING A 
HIGH LEVEL DELEGATION INTO NORTH
KOREA AND THE U.S. PUTTING IT 
BACK ON A STATE SPONSOR OF LISTS
BEING REMOVED FROM THAT IN 2008 
AND YET, THIS IS HOW NORTH KOREA
RESPONDS. 
>> IT APPEARED TO LAND IN WATERS
JUST OFF OF JAPAN INSIDE 
JAPANESE TERRITORY.
>> THE ECONOMIC INCLUSION ZONE 
IS CALLED, BUT I THINK WHAT'S 
ALSO IMPORTANT, GEORGE, IT 
WASN'T AIMED AT GUAM.
IT TRAVELED INTO THE SEA OF 
JAPAN WHERE THE OTHERS HAVE, SO 
IT WASN'T AS PRO VOCATIVE AS IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN BUT PROVOCATIVE 
NONETHELESS.
>> PRESIDENT TAKING QUESTIONS 
NOW.
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.
>> IT'S GOING TO BE BIGGER, 
STRONGER, BETTER THAN BEFORE.
WE WANT TO GET GOING ON THAT 
NOW.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE FROM THIS 
MORNING WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT WE
WERE WAY, WAY FAR AWAY AND WITH 
THAT, I MAY JUST HAVE GENERAL 
MATTIS SAY JUST A COUPLE OF 
WORDS ABOUT WHAT HE HAS FOUND 
OUT.
DO YOU WANT TO SAY JUST A COUPLE
LITTLE PIECES OF INFORMATION?
>> SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES 
MATTIS. 
>> 2.5 HOURS AGO, NORTH KOREA 
LAUNCHED AN INTERCONTINENTAL 
BALLISTIC MISSILE.
IT WENT HIGHER, FRANKLY, THAN 
ANY OTHER THAT HAS TAKEN.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON 
THEIR PART TO BUILD BALLISTIC 
MISSILES THAT COULD THREATEN 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BASICALLY 
AND IN RESPONSE, THE SOUTH 
KOREANS HAVE FIRED SOME END 
POINT MISSILES OUT INTO THE 
WATER TO MAKE CERTAIN NORTH 
KOREA UNDERSTANDS THEY COULD BE 
TAKEN UNDER FIRE BY OUR ALLY.
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S A 
CONTINUED EFFORT TO BUILD 
THREAT, BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT
THAT ENDANGERS WORLD PEACE, 
REGIONAL PEACE AND CERTAINLY THE
UNITED STATES.
>> THANK YOU, GENERAL.
AND WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT 
SITUATION.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH THE 
REMARKS IN THE ROOM.
OUR CORRESPONDENT WITH MORE ON 
THIS.
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT GOT GOOD
NEWS AND SOME SOMEWHAT BAD NEWS 
ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT TODAY.
SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE PASSED 
THEIR VERSION OF THE TAX CUT 
PLAN TO HEAD TO THE SENATE FLOOR
RIGHT NOW BUT FARTHER AWAY THAN 
EVER FROM THE DEMOCRATS TO AVOID
THE POSSIBLE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 8. 
>> IT HAS BEEN A REAL TIT FOR 
TAT ALL DAY HERE WITH CAPITOL 
HILL AND THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU SAW THAT HE IS SITTING THERE
WITH A STRATEGICALLY PLACED 
EMPTY CHAIRS AS YOU MENTIONED.
THE CHAIRS SUPPOSED TO BE CHUCK 
AND NANCY.
NO MENTION OF HIS OWN TWEET THAT
PROMPTED CHUCK AND NANCY, IF YOU
WILL, SCHUMER AND PELOSI TO NOT 
SHOW UP, THIS BAITING TWEET HE 
SENT OUT THIS MORNING GOADING 
THEM ESSENTIALLY AND THEY DIDN'T
SHOW UP.
BUT I WAS REALLY STRUCK, CAMERAS
WERE NOT INITIALLY SUPPOSED TO 
BE IN THAT ROOSEVELT ROOM TODAY.
THIS WAS GOING TO BE A CLOSED 
EVENT WITH THE BIG FIVE AND FOUR
AND THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND AT
THE LAST MINUTE, THEY WERE LET 
IN BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAD A 
MESSAGE TO GET OUT THERE.
HOW LITTLE THIS PRESIDENT SAID 
ABOUT NORTH KOREA IN THE WAKE OF
WHAT WE WERE TOLD IS THE LONGEST
DURATION OF THE MISSILE IN THE 
AIR.
50 MINUTES, THE HIGHEST EVER 
FIRED.
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST MENTIONED 
IT AND THEN MOVED ON TO GOING 
RIGHT BACK ABOUT NANCY AND 
CHUCK.
SO CLEARLY, THE MESSAGE REALLY 
THAT HE WANTED TO SEND HERE, 
PARTLY NORTH KOREA BUT 
PREDOMINANTLY ABOUT THE FIGHT 
AND THIS TIT FOR TAT HAPPENING 
BETWEEN HIM AND THE DEMOCRATS ON
TAX REFORM. 
>> WE'LL SEE IF THIS IS A FIRST 
IN THE SERIES OF NEW TESTS FROM 
THE NORTH KOREA GOVERNMENT.
WE'LL SIGN OFF RIGHT NOW.
MUCH MORE ON OUR WORLD NEWS 
TONIGHT WITH DAVID MUIR AND SEE 
YOU TOMORROW ON GMA.
>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 
REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
