so Bill Bennett is a disgraced Republican is there any other kind anyway he wrote a book on morality and then admitted that he lost all his family's money gambling okay I'll just let that sit there for a little while look I know folks who like to gamble but we didn't lose all of our family money on losing millions of dollars on the slots dude that takes some effort to be fair to Bill Bennett he worked hard at losing that money so he is going after the media and Democrats of course and he went on Fox News and he is going to address Nancy Pelosi statement saying that the press are guardians of our democracy Free Press is an important part of our democracy but if the bad guys are coming over the wall who do you want defending you the staff at CNN or the United States Marine o'clock point okay all right there are different things that contribute to our democracy that doesn't mean that they are better than Marines at fighting like this is a conversation we're having the Supreme Court an important part of our democracy right I hope so I hope most of you agree with that right so from now on only Marines on the Supreme Court I can go on and on really we're gonna be this stupid so the only ones qualified to say anything are people with guns otherwise you're not really part of our democracy if you wanna grab of God let's start opposed you're gonna run i order go red and they make that point at how if I said like oh that was good bill nailed it man let's go play some slots watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded or stream it watch it any way you like at TYT Network com slash join
