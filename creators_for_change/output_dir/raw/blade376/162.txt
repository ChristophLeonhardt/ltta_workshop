1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
a subject in life that's always

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,410
fascinated me is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject of free</font>

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,130
will do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it and when studying my</font>

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,620
psychology degree the parts of

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,870
psychology I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enjoyed most was</font>

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,900
anything related to what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,990
human what makes us human and what makes

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,119
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> special so I'll give my explanation</font>

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,890
on things and then I'll leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to you</font>

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,869
guys out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to post your video</font>

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,369
responses and comments on what you think

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,260
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> free will is one of those things</font>

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,150
that we all know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but when it</font>

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,420
comes to explaining it in words it

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,520
becomes quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult but I have pen</font>

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
and paper so I can show you on here so

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,350
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine we had a box of marbles</font>

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,980
and for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> sake let's say there</font>

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,590
were five in this box if we were to

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,320
shake this box side to side really

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,629
really fiercely but there was no

22
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,100
friction with it they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keep</font>

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,860
bouncing around forever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever now</font>

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,440
keeping that in mind if we had a

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer program that monitored the</font>

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,340
movement it would actually be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,069
calculate if fast enough a prediction of

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,189
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> movement of every marble from now</font>

29
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,320
till the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of time and it doesn't</font>

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the marbles collide or bounce</font>

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,180
off the side of the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer would have calculated this</font>

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,409
there would only be one variable present

34
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,630
which is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the marbles themselves</font>

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,920
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it comes to talking about</font>

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,320
people we have personalities we talk we

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,520
experience life now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about on the physiological level</font>

39
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,299
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would experience me talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,490
right now goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your ears and your</font>

41
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,119
brain processes it and then you react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,829
it you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to close down the</font>

43
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,090
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might want to leave I hate a</font>

44
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,740
comment because<font color="#CCCCCC"> some things come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you need to say it but now when</font>

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,610
you take those actions is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

47
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,799
you've taken full control to do it or

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,860
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing it anyway because</font>

49
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,540
like that makes us human special

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,479
compared to other<font color="#E5E5E5"> animals and this can</font>

51
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,829
be argued is our ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rationalize</font>

52
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,799
and a famous example<font color="#CCCCCC"> is with a bird if a</font>

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,369
bird feels a drop of water<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit its peak</font>

54
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,139
it will fly off because it's hardwired

55
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,750
to go

56
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,150
danger and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just an instinctive</font>

57
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing as human beings we can rationalize</font>

58
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,300
our thoughts but what that is saying is

59
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,560
we're actually only thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

60
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,480
things that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already happened but</font>

61
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may say oh well I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might make the</font>

62
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
choice to head out the front door now

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,380
and go to the shops well it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

64
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,670
your free choice that could be how you

65
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,700
feel but the truth is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the desire</font>

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,620
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to go out that front door and</font>

67
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,390
the desire for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to go to the shops</font>

68
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,230
was already made by an internal desire

69
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,080
from your body whether it's needing food

70
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,930
needing drink or needing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out</font>

71
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,540
somewhere I think the point is that what

72
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,239
we experience is the illusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of free</font>

73
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,190
will but this address is a really

74
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting question doesn't it and that</font>

75
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,150
is responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I think this has</font>

76
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,640
already been addressed and that is with

77
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,630
religion we take atheism you know

78
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,459
something I remember the chaplain<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

79
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,640
high school said how atheists would be

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,050
more willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out a murder people</font>

81
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,780
because they would have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> consequences</font>

82
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their actions because they don't</font>

83
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe in god or an afterlife and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

84
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">just thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was really ignorant</font>

85
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,180
because I mean someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> like me who is</font>

86
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,430
just open minded I don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

87
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,190
particular religion ID take

88
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,040
responsibility because I have a desire

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,380
to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be decent other people and</font>

90
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">make my choices in life in ways that</font>

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,430
will never have a negative impact on

92
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,340
other people I mean sure negative things

93
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,160
sometimes do happen but you try perhaps

94
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,959
though it would never<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible for us</font>

95
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,970
to accept that freeway was just an

96
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,160
illusion because it kind of makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

97
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,640
same I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people before they've done</font>

98
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,209
research on free will and some of them

99
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,950
have actually gone into counseling as a

100
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,590
result because of the realization<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

101
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,110
their minds that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we aren't actually in</font>

102
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,110
control and I just find<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a fascinating</font>

103
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,019
thing but what do I think well i'm just

104
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to live life for what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

105
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,440
enjoy the<font color="#E5E5E5"> experiences and if it means</font>

106
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,729
I'm gonna stay held within the illusion

107
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,330
of having free will then say beer

108
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,849
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think</font>

109
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,220
from a philosophical and scientific

110
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,319
perspective the whole aspects of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Destiny</font>

111
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,930
like these marbles if the computer

112
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">program would see them bouncing off each</font>

113
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,240
other technically you would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,449
predict<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future but obviously with</font>

115
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,000
humanity and how many human beings there

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,949
are in this world and how many varying

117
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,509
factors there are politics or with

118
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:54,180
scientific developments social factors

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,889
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the world is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

120
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,810
complex that we would never be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

121
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,909
predict the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future in that way but in</font>

122
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:06,330
theory everything is predetermined what

123
00:05:06,330 --> 00:00:00,000
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>
