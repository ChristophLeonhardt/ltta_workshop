DAN HELMER, I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. I'M DIFFERENT, I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. I'M A ROAD SCHOLAR SERVED IN MILITARY. I'M FOR MEDICATION AND I WILL PROTECT THE GUN WILL PROTECT THE CUN WILL PROTECT THE CHILDREN FROM THE GUN LOBBY. ONCE OUR GREATEST THREAT WAS IN A CAVE TODAY HE LIVES IN THE WHITE HOUSE. BARBARA COMSTOCK HAS BEATEN EVERY POLITICIAN. I'M DIFFERENT. PETE: YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. A NEW DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN AD FOR A CONGRESSIONAL RACE IN VIRGINIA COMPARING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP TO USAMA BIN LADEN; JOINING ME NOW THE MAN BEHIND THE AD VIRGINIA DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE DAN HELMER. THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE. PETER. I'M HAPPY TO BE ON THE SHOW. PETE: YOU SERVED OUR COUNTRY INFANTRY IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. THANK YOU I DO KNOW. PETE: SAME PLACES. I'M SURE WE DID, THANK YOU. PETE: THAT GOES AS A GIVEN, NO MATTER WHAT. WE KNOW YOU ARE RUNNING IN A PROUD OF PRIMARIES AND TRYING TO GET NOTICED. I'M TRYING TO TALK ABOUT AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE. PETE: OBVIOUSLY AN AD LIKE THIS GETS NOTED WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS ON THE HIGHEST RATED CABLE SHOW IN AMERICA. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. PETE: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF USAMA BIN LADEN? I ACTUALLY THINK, YOU KNOW, ON 9/11, MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL OF THOSE WE LOST THAT DAY AND THEIR FAMILIES. I WAS A CADET AT WEST POINT. AND I KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE SPENDING THE NEXT TWO YEARS PREPARING TO LEAD SOLDIERS IN COMBAT AND I SERVED COMBAT TOURS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. DID I IT FOR A SIMPLE REASON. I SWORE AN OATH TO UPHOLD AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC. AND RIGHT NOW,. PETE: I SWORE THE SAME OATH. PRESIDENT TRUMP SWORE THE SAME OATH. ARE YOU SAYING IS ARE YOU SAYING DS ARE YOU SAYING DOMESTIC ENEMY? OBVIOUSLY SOBBELL A FOREIGN ENEMY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A DOMESTIC ENEMY? I'M SAYING THAT THE OATH WE TOOK TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION I TAKE SERIOUSLY. THIS PRESIDENT DOESN'T. ONE OF THE REASONS I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE ON A SHOW THAT I KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT WATCHES EVERY MORNING IS TO MAKE SURE WE DELIVER A MESSAGE THAT CHANGE IS COMING. THAT NO ONE, NOT EVEN OUR PRESIDENT, IS ABOVE THE LAW. PETE: HOLD ON. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A CONGRESS THAT HOLDS HIM ACCOUNTABLE. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE WHO THINK WE NEED TO WAIT AND SEE ABOUT A PRESIDENT WHO HAS VIOLATED OUR CONSTITUTION AND OUR LAWS. PETE: BECAUSE HE FIRED JAMES COMEY AND SAYS BAD THINGS ABOUT BOB MUELLER. LET'S BE CLEAR HERE. THE PRESIDENT HAS VIOLATED THE CLAUSE IN THE CONSTITUTION. HE HAS DONE ACTIONS THAT OBSTRUCT JUSTIFIABLE AND HAMPERED WITHENSES WITH. HE HAS VIOLATED CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS. ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS ENGAGED IN CONDUCT UNBECOMING OF A PRESIDENT. PETE: A EQUALS B. DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRORIST? I SAID THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY RIGHT NOW IS A PRESIDENT WHO REFUSES TO UPHOLD HIS OATH TO ABIDE BY OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEFEND IT WE CAN SEE WHO HIS FRIENDS ARE. AFTER I WENT AFTER THIS AFTER I LAUNCHED THIS AD, RT ATTACKED ME BECAUSE THEY ALSO HELPED HIM WITH THE ELECTION. PETE: BECAUSE THEY HELPED HIM WITH THE ELECTION? THIS IS WHAT THE RUSSIANS JUST DID. THE RUSSIANS JUST ACTUALLY PUT OUT SOMETHING IN RESPONSE TO THIS AD SAYING THEY WERE DEFENDING PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SEE HIM WIN. PETE: RUSSIANS CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT. LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT. GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION. I'M STANDING ON THE ISLAND OF MANHATTAN, YOU WERE AT WEST POINT. WE ARE NOT DEBATING. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED. WE AGREE, USAMA BIN LADEN'S ATTACK WAS ABHORRENT. I WAS WILLING TO PUT US ON THE LINE TO DEFEND US AGAINST THAT. PETE: I GOT IT SO DID SO MANY PEOPLE. THAT'S A GOOD LINE. SO MANY PEOPLE DIED FOR THAT. BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT OUR CONSTITUTION. PETE: YOU ARE RETURNING FOR OFFICE. WHEN YOU RUN FOR OFFICE YOU GET SCRUTINIZED. AND WHEN YOU PUT AN AD OUT USAMA BIN LADEN, TRUMP ARE THE SAME THING. YOU HAVE TO DEFEND THAT TELL ME IS, THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USAMA BIN LADEN AND DONALD TRUMP? THEY ARE. THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT THREATS. PETE: ARE THEY BOTH ENEMIES. GREATETH THREAT IS A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T TAKE THE OATH TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION, SERIOUSLY. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT? LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AD. TALK ABOUT PROGRESSIVE PATRIOTISM THAT STANDS FOR MAKING SURE EVERY AMERICAN HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. PETE: YOU ARE ACCUSING OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE RACE SAYING THEY IN BED WITH THE NRA BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS THOUSAND DEFEND A SCHOOL THAN YOU DO. BARBARA COMSTOCK HAS TAKEN OVER $130,000 FROM THE NRA. AND SO YOU CAN WALK INTO A GUN SHOW IN MY DISTRICT AND WALK OUT WITHOUT A BACKGROUND CHECK WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU AND I CARRY. PETE: DID YOU ANOTHER VIDEO ON THAT. I SAW THAT MY POINT IS HERE. I DIDN'T DO A VIDEO ON IT THE POINT IS THAT THE NRA. PETE: SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY AND REASONABLE GUY. YOU ARE A ROAD SCHOLAR. I HAVE BEEN TO SOME GOOD SCHOOLS TOO. I GOT IT YOU ARE DIGGING YOUR HEELS IN ON AN ARGUMENT THAT'S UNTENABLE AND MAKING YOURSELF LOOK BAD, A PROGRESSIVE WHO SAYS OUR PRESIDENT IS THE SAME AS THE GUY WHO MURDERED THREE THOUSAND AMERICANS. I DIDN'T SAY THEY ARE THE SAME. I SAID HE IS A THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY. YOU ARE CHANGING WORDS. THAT'S THE PROPAGANDA THAT COMES OUT SOMETIMES. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE LEADERS THAT ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE. PETE: THAT'S WHY WE DO HAVE ELECTIONS. WE DO HAVE ELECTIONS.
