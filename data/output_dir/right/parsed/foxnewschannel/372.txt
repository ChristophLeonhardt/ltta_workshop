IT'S AS WRITTEN.
PETE: THAT WAS PRESIDENT
TRUMP LAST NIGHT ABOUT 15
MINUTES FROM MY PARENT'S
HOMETOWN IN ROCHESTER,
OVERFLOWING THE CROWD AT THE
ARENA.
WE WILL BRING IN KELLYANNE
CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE
THIS MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
PETE: EVERYONE IS TALKING
ABOUT THIS VOTE COMING AND
COME ON SATURDAY.
YOU ARE ON THE INSIDE.
HANDICAP WHERE WE ARE RIGHT
NOW WITH THOSE KEY VOTES.
>> YOU HEARD CHAIRMAN
GRASSLEY AND I LIKE TO ECHO
SOME OF WHAT HE SAID THAT
THE PROCESS HAS BEEN
THOROUGH.
IT'S GONE ON MUCH LONGER AND
MUCH DEEPER THAN ANY SUPREME
COURT JUSTICE IN MODERN
HISTORY IF NOT EVER AND NOW
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.
I WON'T GET AHEAD OF THOSE
SENATORS WHO TRULY SEEM TO
BE GRAPPLING WITH THEIR
DECISION.
I WOULD POINT OUT WHAT
SEVERAL OF THOSE SENATORS
HAVE REQUESTED HAS BEEN
DONE.
WE HAD RACHEL MITCHELL FROM
ARIZONA.
JEFF FLAKE'S HOME STATE
HIGHLY REGARDED SEX CRIMES
PROSECUTOR.
DOING THE QUESTIONING ON
BEHALF OF THE REPUBLICANS ON
THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.
SHE THEN CAME OUT WITH A
FIVE-PAGE MEMO SAYING SHE
COULD NEVER EVEN BRING
CHARGES LET ALONE
SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE A
CASE LIKE THIS BASED ON WHAT
SHE HAD REVIEWED.
WE HAD THE INVESTIGATION AND
HAVING COMPLETED THE SEVENTH
INVESTIGATION OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH IN HIS ADULT LIFE,
INCLUDING TWO THIS VERY
CALENDAR YEAR.
ONE COMPLETED IN JULY.
ONE COMPLETED JUST THIS WEEK
ALL OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE
BEEN ANSWERED.
MANY ALL OF THE PEOPLE ARE
THUMPING THEIR CHEST AND
STOMPING THEIR FEET.
WE MUST HAVE AN FBI
INVESTIGATION.
IT WON'T TAKE THAT LONG
CRITICAL TO OUR VOTE.
NOW THEY HAVE IT.
IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH FOR
THEM.
I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO HAVE
SAID TWO AND A HALF WEEKS
AGO.
LET THIS WOMAN BE HEARD.
WE DID HEAR HER.
WE HEARD HER FOR HOURS UNDER
OATH.
WE HEARD FROM THE PEOPLE WHO
SAID COULD CORROBORATE WHAT
SHE ALLEGES HAPPENED 36
YEARS AS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DON'T
FORGET THAT WE HAVE ALSO
HEARD FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH
33 HOURS ORIGINALLY, 1200
WRITTEN RESPONSES TO
QUESTIONS OVER 1 MILLION
PIECES OF PAPER PRODUCED
OVER HIS CAREER.
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE SO ANGRY
AND CHASING DOWN SENATORS IN
THE HALLS AND SCREAMING
THEIR HEADS OFF AS IF THOSE
MEN HAVE PERSONALLY AND
INDIVIDUALLY WRONGED THEM,
THEY DON'T EVEN STOP AND
THINK ABOUT THE 28 YEARS OF
PUBLIC SERVICE OF JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
FEMALE.
ALL OF THEM ARE STANDING BY
THEM.
NOT ALL OF THEM VOTED FOR
DONALD TRUMP.
THE PRESIDENT NOMINATED
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
THOSE WHO ARE ANGRY.
I RESPECT THE FACT THAT I
LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE
CAN DISAGREE.
THEY ARE NOT DISAGREEING.
THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROY.
THIS IS ACRIMONY AND ANGER
THAT DIDN'T METASTASIZE
THREE WEEKS AGO.
SOME OF THESE WOMEN HAVE
BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND
MARINATING IN IT FOR YEARS.
CHASING DOWN ORRIN HATCH AND
CHUCK GRASSLEY DID.
THEY INDIVIDUALLY WRONG
THESE WOMEN?
THEY CAN'T BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER MAN
OR MEN HAVE WRONGED THESE
WOMEN CHASING PEOPLE OUT OF
RESTAURANTS.
BRIAN: REPUBLICANS ARE NOT
CHASING DOWN DEMOCRATS.
AINSLEY: NO.
BRIAN: THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
HAS BEEN REGARDING THE
ISSUE.
REAL QUICK.
WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT
HOW THESE FOUR ARE GOING TO
VOTE.
YOU BROUGHT UP AN
INTERESTING POINT IN THE
BREAK ABOUT SENATOR JEFF
FLAKE.
THERE MIGHT BE SOME TYPE OF
CONNECTION.
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
CONSERVATIVE EVEN THOUGH HE
HAS BEEN AT ODDS WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THERE MIGHT BE A CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE PROSECUTOR,
MITCHELL, WHO ASKED THE
QUESTIONS.
AND CAME TO THOSE
CONCLUSIONS.
THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF
HOLES IN THE STORY THAT
COULDN'T PROSECUTE
DR. FORD'S CASE.
AND HOW FLAKE GOES.
IN WHAT WAY?
>> NO.
THE ONLY THING I WAS SAYING
THAT RACHEL MITCHELL THE SEX
CRIMES PROSECUTOR THE
REPUBLICANS OF THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE ASKED TO STAND IN
FOR THEM AND POSE THE
QUESTIONS TO DR. FORD AND
SHE DID.
AND I THOUGHT SHE DID A
GREAT JOB IN SO DOING.
I'M SURE THAT SENATOR FLAKE
IS FAMILIAR WITH HER AND HER
WORK.
BECAUSE IS HE A LONG-TIME
CONGRESSMAN AND SENATOR
REPRESENTING THE STATE OF
ARIZONA.
BUT, THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING ABOUT SENATOR FLAKE
AND I RESPECT THAT HE IS
GRAPPLING WITH THIS DECISION
AND I APPRECIATE THE
INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY IN
WHICH HE HAS APPROACHED THIS
PROCESS.
THE THING ABOUT SENATOR
FLAKE IS, ONE SHORT WEEK
AGO, HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE
WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
AND HE DID TO GET JUDGE
KAVANAUGH OUT OF COMMITTEE.
REMEMBER, THAT VOTE HAPPENED
A WEEK AGO.
THAT VOTE STANDS.
HE ADVANCED FROM THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,
INCLUDING WITH AN
AFFIRMATIVE VOTE FROM
SENATOR FLAKE.
WHAT CHANGED IS HE WAS
APPROACHED OR CONFRONTED IN
THE HE WILL VARIED BY THESE
WOMEN WHO I SAID GOD BLESS
THEM FOR COMING FORWARD BUT
ALSO, THEY NEED TO FEEL THAT
ANGER TOWARD THEIR
INDIVIDUAL PERPETRATORS, NOT
TOWARDS SENATORS UNCONNECTED
COMPLETELY FROM THE AWFUL
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO
THEM IN THE PAST.
BUT SENATOR FLAKE ALREADY
HAS MADE JOYFUL NOISES ABOUT
SUPPORTING JUDGE KAVANAUGH
TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME
COURT.
HE ASKED FOR THE
SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION
BY THE FBI U AND IT WAS
SENATOR FLAKE WHO SAID NO
LONGER THAN ONE WEEK.
AND ALL OF THAT HAS COME TO
PASS.
SO, NOW HE WILL ANNOUNCE HIS
DECISION.
I THINK THE WILD CARD HERE
IS ALSO SENATOR JOE MANCHIN
FROM WEST VIRGINIA.
A STATE WHERE THE VAST
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO
VOTED HIM IN TO OFFICE HAVE
SAID THEY ALSO WANT JUDGE
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED TO THE
SUPREME COURT.
DO YOU LISTEN TO THE WILL OF
YOUR VOTERS BACK AT HOME OR
DO YOU LISTEN TO THE LEADERS
OF A DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO
HAVE BEEN SO DISHONEST AND
DO YOU POLICE TIS IN
DO YOU DOLICE TIS IN
DO YOU DO YCE TIS IN
DO YOU DO YOU TIS IN
DO YOU DO YOU PIS IN
DO YOU DO YOU POL IN
DO YOU DO YOU POLICN
DO YOU DO YOU POLICE TIS.
THEY WANTED TESTIMONY AND
THEY GOT IT THEY WANTED
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI
INVESTIGATION THEY GOT IT
HAS A SINGLE DEMOCRAT
CHANGED HIS OR HER MIND
BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT
THEY HAVE ASKED FOR AND HAVE
RECEIVED?
AND LET ME TELL YOU ONE MORE
THING, EVERY WAY THAT DONALD
TRUMP, MY BOSS AND OUR
PRESIDENT IS DESCRIBED BY
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS
EXACTLY HOW THE CRAZY LEFT
IS ACTING DESCRIBE HIM AS
FUMING AND ANGRY AND
ISOLATED AND THROWING
THINGS.
HE IS NOT THAT WAY AT ALL.
I'M WITH HIM EVERY DAY.
THE WAY THEY BEHAVE WILL NOT
ENDING WITH THE CONFIRMATION
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, THEY HAVE
BEEN WATCHING.
IT'S WHY THERE IS MORE
ENTHUSIASM NOW ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE.
THEY ARE SO APPALLED AT THE
TREATMENT OF ONE MAN WHO HAS
HAD 28 YEARS IN PUBLIC
SERVICE AND AN IMPECCABLE
RECORD TO SERVE IN THE
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.
SEARCH AND DESTROY IS
EXACTLY THE WAY NOT ADVICE
AND CONSENT.
AINSLEY: SO MUCH HYPOCRISY.
WOMEN GETTING IN FACES.
THEY ARE USING GENDER TO GET
THEIR POINTS ACROSS.
BUT, YET, THEY'RE ARE THE
RUNNING ATTACKING MEN IN THE
ELEVATOR AND YELLING AT
THEM.
HOW DARE YOU TALK TO A WOMAN
THAT WAY.
IT'S DANGEROUS.
>> AINSLEY LET'S SAY AS
AMERICANS AND MOMS, TERRIFIC
THAT LOTS OF WOMEN ARE
COMING FORWARD.
>> CORRECT.
>> THEY WANT TO TELL THEIR
STORIES.
THEY NEED TO BE HEARD, BUT
WHY JUST IN THE CONTEXT OF
THIS SUPREME COURT HEARING
FOR THIS MAN BASED ON 36
YEARS OLD ALLEGATIONS THAT
ARE STILL UNCORROBORATED TO
THIS MOMENT?
IF YOU WANT -- IF WE WANT TO
HELP WOMEN, SEXUAL ASSAULT
VICTIMS, LET'S DO IT.
BUT I DIDN'T SEE NANCY
PELOSI DOING MUCH ABOUT IT
WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKER.
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HEAR MUCH
ABOUT IT IN THE 2016
ELECTION WITH QUEEN BEE
TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP
AND ALL ASSORTED OF NONSENSE
THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE
VOTERS.
IN FACT, I DON'T HEAR ABOUT
THE HILLARY CLINTON CENTER
FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS NOW TWO
YEARS LATER.
THE BILL CLINTON SENATOR
CENTER FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS
MIGHT BE A MORE INTERESTING
ENDEAVOR.
HILLARY CLINTON CENTER FOR
WOMEN AND GIRLS.
WHERE IS THAT?
SHE IS STILL TALKING ABOUT
THE 2016 ELECTION.
OF THE HYPOCRISY OF EVEN
TRYING TO HELP WOMEN WHO
HAVE BEEN HARMED BY THE LEFT
IS SO -- IT'S SO PERVERTED
OF AND SUBVERTED NOW.
I FEEL SORRY FOR THESE WOMEN
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET
SATISFACTION REPUBLICAN
SENATORS CONFIRMATION
HEARING THROUGH THE UNITED
