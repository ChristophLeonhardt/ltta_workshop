the trick is to not overspray so the question then leads to how much is over spraying and where do we spray probably the easiest way I would describe it is if you just sort of stretched your arms out if somebody is within that circle of your arms with that's the first cent they ought to get if they're further away than that it's a little bit too much so you can spray your hands around your body but no more than maybe two or three spritzes from the bottle once you go past that you may be moving into dangerous territory generally speaking the pulse points work so maybe a little bit on your wrist to spray the wrist through this behind your ears so that you enjoy the fragrance yourself there's nothing wrong with putting a little bit right here just see you're you're catching that set a lot of people do that
