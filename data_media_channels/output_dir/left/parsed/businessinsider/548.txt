you
it is the planter box vineyard system on
a 15,000 square foot rooftop here in the
Brooklyn Navy Yard
after you
this is a micro vineyard each one of
these vines gets so much more attention
than a traditional vine would in a 40 or
acre or 150 acre block
it's literally the Freedom Tower in the
background and people on a deck
overlooking a rooftop vineyard enjoying
a glass of wine and doing the tasting
and that's exactly what you can do
