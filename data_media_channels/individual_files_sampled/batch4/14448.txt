it's September 14th I'm Ezra Levant and you're watching battleground oh hi everybody it's Friday and I'm in the city so what a pleasure to join you as I like to do every Friday at 12:00 noon Eastern Time 5 p.m. UK time for battleground a live chat super chat super chat is a funny word invented by YouTube it means that as we chant live on the right hand side of the screen you can make your comments as usual but if you chip in a few dollars or pounds or pesos your comment is put in a bright highlighted color and I can see it out of the corner of my eye and I'll read it out loud and it's sometimes appended to the top of the box there so it's a fun way to make your questions stand out and I do endeavor to read every super chat comment plus speaking as a content creator we get 70% of the dough so it's a good way for us to survive given the general D monetization of of YouTube I mean as you know they have D monetized the conservative side of the aisle and in fact why don't we start off with that as you may know YouTube is owned by Google so Google obviously by far the largest search engine in the world YouTube I think it's the second largest search engine in the world it's amazing how many YouTube videos there are how to any how to tie a tie how to fix a lightbulb I mean it really it's an enormous search engine and thus it is susceptible and powerful as a tool a political bias and the reason I mention this is because just a few days ago Breitbart comm and our friend Alan Bukhari their senior tech correspondent there got a copy of an internal video from Google three days after Donald Trump won the u.s. presidential election 2016 so they have I guess a traditionally at Google to have Friday staff meetings I don't know if it's every Friday I think they call it TGIF or something and they obviously gathered in the theater of the Google headquarters and it was recorded probably four people on off-site locations and someone recorded it and shared it with breitbart.com and it is unbelievable and I want to show you there's so many clips and you got to watch the whole thing at breitbart.com but let me show you a clip of the CFO that's the chief financial officer you know in any company especially when the size of Google there's a lot of executives but there's only a handful of what they call c-level executives that's the CEO chief executive officer CEO chief operating officer C F Oh chief financial officer the c-level executives are the most senior and of course Sergey Brin the top dog himself was there let me show you what I think her name is Ruth Porat said and you'll see that Google is not just a company Google is a political organization bordering on a cult and just no more for me take it from Ruth Porat CFO 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday night I was at home with a friends and family watching the election returns and as we started to see the direction of the voting I reached out to someone close to me who was at the Javits Center where the big celebration was supposed to occur in New York City somebody been working on the campaign and I just sent him a note said you know are you ok it looked like it's going the wrong way and I got back a very sad short text that read people are leaving staff is crying we're going to lose how was the first moment I really felt like we were gonna lose and it was as massive like kick in the gut that we were gonna lose and it was really meaningful it did feel like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest and I've had a chance to talk to a lot of fellow Googlers and people have said different words similar concept this how painful is it how painful this is now I should tell you that that clip there is absolutely indicative and representative of the rest of the incredible interview and a video and and in case it doesn't jump right out on you let me tell you what I thought was interesting there number one this is at a staff meeting I know every single person never will talk about Donald Trump's victory in Hillary Clinton's loss of course it was the most important news day in 2016 and perhaps over the other decade I talked about it but imagine having a staff meeting of hundreds of Google staff and it's a the subject of a staff meeting it's it's not banter over lunch suck going out after drinks you have to work for drinks it's not a coffee talk over you know at the photocopier this is an official Google meaning to talk about it and she's in tears she's a grown woman probably toughest as you don't get to be a CFO of Google unless you were made of ayran I don't know maybe she's an affirmative action hire but I don't think I don't think companies generally put affirmative action hires in the CFO position it's one of the most important and she's crying and she said she was texting with someone at Hillary Clinton's leadership victory party probably Eric Schmidt who was her senior who basically the the former executive vice president of Google who was a campaign staffer for Hillary Clinton we don't know the attending that person but besides the fact that this was at an official meeting and they were all bawling like this The Crying the the cult-like affiliation talking as if a personal friend had died or something that an election result did you notice she said we we lost not Hillary Clinton lost not the Democrats lost not they lost we we so she's a senior executive at Google at an official Google meeting on Google premises in the name of Google during business hours and she said we lost and she wasn't an outlier every single person in that room from the CEO on down said the same thing they're absolutely an embedded integral part of the Democrats and there were other clips and I won't show them now because I did a great segment I thought with Helen Bukhari on this you can find it on our web site elsewhere we went through about four different clips four or five clips you can find them there but where they said we have to get in the arena and fix things one Google staffers asked a question though is this a disaster of historic proportions and and the other senior executives said we have to get in the arena and stop it and and there was some self denunciation some weird beta male white male said we have we white males have to denounce ourselves and I'm gonna do that and you should too and it was applause from all it was just really really crazy cult-like and you know there was some shoutouts to every single sort of diversity racial diversity ethnic diversity religious diversity sexual diversity at this meaning he should watch it but I'm but the one diversity that was not allowed was diversity of opinion imagine being a secret trump supporter at that meeting that would be like you know saying you were a Nazi or something like the shrill insanity they're the reason I tell you that is because they continue to infect the Google algorithm with their politics just for fun I'll play the white privilege clip I don't want to spend too much more time on it because I did a segment on it this week but take a look at this guy just take a look yes sorry I'll take one at each mic sorry sir maybe speaking to white men there's an opportunity for you right now to understand your privilege in the society take the opportunity to go through the bias busting training read about privilege read about the real history of oppression in our country and tomorrow night watch 13th the movie that is here if you can't watch it here watch it on Netflix discuss the issues you're passionate about during Thanksgiving dinner and don't back down and laugh it off when you hear the voice of oppression speak through metaphors and I promise to do this what a weird kook you know Sergey Brin the guy with the the mop of hair and the beard he was born in the former Soviet Union he was the son his dad was a math professor he came from smart people and let me just say a little story about Sergey Brin because they were there was some hoods were there of that self-hating beta male with a backpack on who said you know I'm I'm reading these self-hating books and I encourage everyone to do so and learn about the oppression of our country and that's the irony there because Sergey Brin did not come from oppression America he came from the former Soviet Union's born in Moscow and his dad was a was a math professor and if I know my history right his dad went to a conference in Warsaw Poland which of course was under the Soviet bloc the Warsaw Pact as it was called actually and his dad at this conference in Warsaw met some professors from the West I don't know from where France probably something like that and he discovered that the West through this conference as the history goes that the West was not full of monsters and in fact it looked like a pretty great place with open minds I see the super chat from Andrew Dodds $2 thanks very much and if you have a comment I'll read it so Sergey Brin's dad goes to Poland meets some people from the West and realizes all the propaganda he's been fed about the West's Ally and the West is not evil in fact the Soviet Union is evil and he decides he's going to leave now this was during the brief period of time when Jimmy Carter and I think there's leonid brezhnev had what was called date talk they were trying to warm things up you know Carter was a real lefty and he had more than a lefty he was naive I mean this and he served in the military which is more than a lot of candidates these days I think he was a submariner but there's a brief period from about 77 to 80 and it ended with the Afghan war when Russians mainly Russian Jews actually could apply for exit visas and could get them so Sergey Brin's dad came back from this conference in Poland talked to the fam and said we're gonna leave for the West and he applied for an exit visa was immediately fired from his job because such disloyalty only a traitor but in the end he got to FISA and he got out of the country with his wife and his kid and from what I understand Sergey Brin accepted his father's world view that the Soviet was indeed an evil place and was most grateful for freedom and of course has used that freedom not only to create create great ideas and a great company but become what the world's 10th richest man worth what 50 billion dollars or something so that is a story of real oppression now in the end they were not tortured they were not killed they got out they were they had a rough go of it but they left a place of oppression to come to America and the other senior executives you saw another guy there I've just briefly forgotten his name obviously a visible minority whose family also came from an a less free country so the story of Google is the story of freedom in America and you have this beta male Google employees saying study the oppression of our country of your country the oppression of your country it was the freedom of your country that made Sergey Brin's Dada say we're going to leave Russia and we're going to go to a mirror and sergey brin applauded that lie a plot of that lie those are the people who adjust the algorithms and the reason I mentioned that it's not just because it's an interesting story but let me show you I'm going to show you I mentioned Tommy Robinson I sat down with him last week in London for an interview I'll show you some clips from that I thought well I was very powerful interview it's almost two hours long we had it in a professional set right on the River Thames in London Tommy was in good form despite the fact he's still recovering from his solitary confinement and starvation I was good enough especially considering I just got off the night night flight from Toronto so we put this video up and we thought it would do very well we thought it would have a hundreds of thousands of views look at this chart I snapped from you YouTube's analytics now let me explain this so this is as the publisher of YouTube videos we have access to this dashboard and as you can see these are the analytics as they call them of the video so the video is called Tommy Robinson and Ezreal of an excuse of interview the blue chart it shows hour by hour and the green chart shows minute by minute if you can believe it so when we rolled out the Tommy Robinson video I don't know if you can see that but the first hour it got put that back up if you would it got almost 10,000 views and the first hour holding up here for a while it's about 9,800 views in the first 60 minutes and then as word spread that this video was online even more people watched and you see the second bar there touches 10,000 so this video was going viral 10,000 people a minute we're watching it and our excuse me 10,000 people an hour it's still very variable a lot that's three people a second because of course there's 60 minutes an hour 60 seconds in a minute so 3,600 seconds per hour ten thousand three people per second we're watching the video three people per second and then what happened there it was cut down to five thousand and then to two thousand and it's been at about a thousand ever since that is not that's not natural now I have no evidence of this but it was an outstanding video of great newsworthiness professionally produced and edited and for the first two hours it was the most popular thing we had done in a month and then BAM almost like someone pushed a button and that video has been suppressed now you might say as are your conspiracy theorists or as are you're making it up or there was some other reason why people were only interested in that video for two hours and then they weren't or you could remember what you saw in those video clips from Google headquarters Google runs YouTube and say yeah someone suppressed that video which is the more likely explanation all right we have two clips from the Tommy interview and I recommend you go see the whole thing it's an hour and a half hour forty minutes you can find the whole thing at the rebel dawn media slash Tommy Robinson but here let's give you a promo this is just a little what we what we used to advertise the video and the day before released it take a look now this prize in what can only be described as a kind of record the first night down there there was a prison of conk on of salad straightaway there's a price up to me I'm taken straight down to the block another first week but didn't a single thing my son cried every day for two months I truly believe I'll be back in prison nice outside force my life tomorrow to bring the changes needed this isn't about my kids yeah this battle is about every single child if they're going to be about then let begin by myself so that's a little teaser of it by the way I see a little super chat by T pilot 1/2 pounds says great man lovely work well thanks very much can I play for you a clip from Tommy and let me set this up a bit so Tommy was in prison he never should have been in prison the Court of Appeal ruled that his imprisonment was illegal the way he was arrested tried convicted sentenced and then handled in prison all of it was illegal it was quashed he was freed but before that court of appeal ruling he was in prison and he was met by officers of the British prison system there's something they call tagged over there in the UK I think in Canada the best analogy would be called a parole that's when you're still under that under a sentence but you're allowed to leave prison on certain conditions and I think the word tag Tommy says comes from they put a little tag like an anklet on you like a GPS anklet or something so what do you think Tommy's conditions would be for bail for for parole often if there are conditions it's don't leave the country or something or maybe the conditions are don't associate with any particular person if you added some quarrel with them but Tommy remember was convicted of contempt of court so maybe don't do something involving courts I don't know let me tell you what the parole officers with the tag officers said would be Tommy's conditions to that amount of prison take a look what condition upon release will be I will be banned from the internet banned from using there till June 2019 how what does that have to do with me you tell me you know you're on my previous present sentence when I was leading mr. venta league my condition which was for legally and in America my condition then was not to contact the EDL so anyone anyone who wants to sit and say that this case this current case is not politically motivated that means that they'd have to accept they'd have to accept for it not to be politically motivated let's have to accept the judge by accident incorrectly a judge of 30 years whele top judge would not realize they has to ask me if I'm guilty or not guilty would not have to tell me what I've done wrong would not have to let me speak to my solicitor with it so then they'll have to buy into that they didn't have to buy into the fact that the prison accidently hold me as a criminal prisoner not a civil prisoner they then have to buy into the fact that just by accident I was moved from the safety of whole into HMP only and put under all of these conditions they then have to see that it's normal for someone to be banned from the internet just never put you out of business and it would shut you up on a hundred other masters will you respect your unrelated to this court case which is what all of this is about who would have drafted that they're tagged condition who wouldn't who's that who's the probation services or not run by the government in prison for can d'accord why would you say you can't make any political videos what's that got to do with contempt of court and as he says when he had other prison matters unrelated to politics his tag conditions censored his politics I mean anyone who thinks Tommy Robinson is being treated fairly by the state just has to look at those bail conditions the whole thing is Tommy would say is a stitch-up I see a very generous super check by Dylan Elle who says your legendary keep up the great work and thanks to you and all the rebels well that's very nice you to say I don't think I'm particularly a legend but I think Tommy is and I'm very affectionate towards Tommy you know he used to be an employee of the rebel but he's a handful I mean the guy's not built to have a boss especially a boss 3,000 miles away five time zones away so we parted ways amicably enough I mean but when we saw him getting into a pickle we thought well geez we got to help this guy out so I'm glad he's out of prison it was nice to see him again I saw him the day he got out of prison but I didn't want to spend a lot of time with him because every minute I was with him I was keeping him away from his family I was very touched that the 90 got out of prison he said come have dinner with me and my family and I tell you every bone in my body wanted to accept that invitation but there was just no bloody way I was going to inject myself into his own personal family situation the first night they have dinner with their dad you know so I was sort of you know I took a lot of personal discipline if I may say so for me to decline that friendly invitation from him he gave me 15 minutes that night if you recall and then I got out of there so it was nice for me to fly back to London last week and sit down from for two hours obviously it's the most we've talked since he was released and then when went out for a nice lunch afterwards right there on the River Thames just sat right next to the river at some little I forget what it was called so sort of fun to see him again and he's got plans he's got plans for stuff he's going to do and I don't know when he's going to announce it and you know will will still be interested in him I don't propose so we go back into business with him so to speak I don't think that's the right way to do it but we'll help him he sat down this legal business yet as you know they're still insisting that he have another contempt of court hearing it be redone so if that proceeds obviously I'm gonna go back out there to London to cover that again and who knows maybe they'll be another court date they'll delay the results and maybe that'll be appealed I mean I shouldn't even start thinking of different scenarios but I mean theoretically you could have another rehearing of the contempt case right and then you could have the results of that rehearing announced on another day and then you could have Tommy appealing that on another day so theoretically you've got three more days they're not done with them and as as is so clear their goal is to break him physically psychologically and financially is that not obvious do I do I even need to try to persuade you of that I see out of the corner of my eye some super chance let me jump in there Blane Sandberg very generous super shot fifty fifty dollars that's unbelievable thank you very much I see you have a car I just hear in my ear that you have a comment down there let me just do asmath thanks so much for having the courage to carry on the fight for free speech truth conservative values and Tommy Robinson it is so important to keep this effort going well thanks Blaine I appreciate that um I mean I like hanging out with Tommy he's fun and he's very British and I should tell you a lot of people have said if you read the comments both to us directly and even online a lot of people say get out of the UK what are you doing in the UK moved to America moved to Poland the surprising number of people say that I don't think he would ever leave the UK he's so British not just in his style and history in psychology and his turf I just I I don't think he would leave to leave would be to surrender like he would equate that with giving up and I mean if I don't know if you've watched the extended interview we would by the way we have two versions of their interview we have a 1 hour and 40 minute version that sounds extremely long I know but it I don't think it drags and then there's a longer version that's over two hours we thought we just got to cut that back a bit because not everyone's got two hours so we cut what we thought were extraneous elements if you want to watch the whole bloody thing you can we've got a link to that so you can watch the two-hour version you couldn't watch the hour and 40 and you're probably saying that's not much of a cop well there were so many gems in there but one of the things Tommy said was he's going to keep finding he has a confidence to keep fighting now because he saw the massive public support including it rallies and one of the things he said and it was sort of a little bit shocking to hear it but not surprising if you know Tommy is that he believes he will be killed in this campaign but that the issues will live on past him and I don't mean to be dark and macabre but I think that the likelihood of him being killed is high in prison obviously he had death threats literally every day including a most serious death threat and again I recommend you watch our interview with him if you haven't where he says there's a there's a convicted terrorist in Britain named saiful islam which means sword of Islam that's obviously an a nickname - is his nom de guerre and this terrorist named saiful islam told another muslim prisoner who was transferred into Tommy's prison to go to Tommy's cell and bring him a death threat from Saif al-islam that happened and by the way the prisoner who passed on the death threat nothing there was no disciplining in whatsoever he wasn't punished so Tommy receives death threats from terror he receives regular death threats from other prisoners I've been with Tommy in the United Kingdom just on the highway when we pull into a gas station to fill up and get a sandwich or something and almost everywhere obviously fans and friends accost him and say oh he taught me how's it going but almost everywhere if there's a young Muslim man who sees Tommy he recognizes Tommy and he wants to go either pick a verbal fight with Tommy or perhaps even have a real fight because imagine being the Brit the Muslim who kills Tommy I mean obviously you go to prison but you'd be a hero of the Ummah forever you'd go to you get your 72 virgins for sure I was sorry to be so dark but if you listen to Tommy talk about it he says that with a not necessarily a fatalism but with serenity in that he believes the fight will continue even once he himself expires so that's what he said to me let's check the time it is 12 28 I'm gonna read some more chat and and we talked about Tommy affair but we talked about Google for a bit so I think we covered it I don't want to spend the whole time talking about Tommy although I find it very interesting but if you haven't yet watch to go to the rebel da media slash Tommy Robinson you can see the one hour and 40 minute edited version or you can if you want the full meal deal you can find a link to it there also on our Twitter page which is twitter.com slash the rebel TV we have 32 short clips of the interview and that might actually be a fun way to watch it if you don't want to sit down and spend a hundred hundred minutes you can watch these clips there none of them are longer than two minutes and 20 seconds that's the longest you can upload a video clip to Twitter I think it's not in periscope mode so if you want a good summary of the conversation just go to our Twitter feed and you those little 32 snacks so to speak um I have a few other things I want to talk about but perhaps a transition would be a trailer for our second rebel documentary we did a documentary earlier this year called save the Christians which was about the ethnic cleansing of the ancient Christian community in Mesopotamia which is a fancy way of saying Syria and Iraq and we went over there and we saw what was going on Isis hates Christians they try and kill them all our second documentary is about another form of ethnic cleansing actually so there's that similarity without further to do let me show you our trailer for a movie called The Killing Fields if you don't do what we are telling you to do we're gonna rip your life in front of you and my husband was murdered in what they classify as a former Tech and they shot him in the head in front of us and he fell at my feet in the last year they were roughly 84 farm murders if you didn't tell us to say which the money becomes desert and becomes untruth a perfect they took my arm like this and they tell me there were cows how long were you raped for these weapons opened I eat the ground they started hitting me and said today we're going to kill you even white poster it's a ratio fee and the world can say what they want the black people don't want to see we belong to each other and we owe it to each other if we want to keep on farming they can come and kill me but I won't go there you go very powerful stuff Katie Hopkins the writer director producer everything or of that movie she went to South Africa for almost two weeks and it's very powerful can we get the full clip of Julius Malema leading that shoot the Boer chant I mean they were there was some shocking things said and done there right at the beginning there was a attacker who said what he says I mean if you don't give us what we want will rape you and we'll rape the little ones that's shocking of course but if it's said by a criminal or a rapist it I suppose is less shocking than if a leading political party Authority the leader of the I think it's the e FF party leads in public this is not in private this is not secretive this is not furtive if he leads a chant by hundreds or maybe thousands of people conditioning them getting hepped up excited about murdering it's that normalization and confirmation and authorization that to me is the most diabolical part here we've got the more extended clip of that so it's a famous song now it's a chant it would be like you know make America great or Locker up in South Africa the chances shoot to kill here take a look there were at least a thousand people there and they all know the words and they all know the call-and-response shoot to kill a pal shoot to kill pow pow the Brewer is the the name of the Dutch heritage white farmers say I mean there's South Africa is British in heritage but it's also Dutch the Dutch were there hundreds of years ago and have been farming ever since so they're not they're not late comers in fact many black Africans migrated to South Africa I mean to share in the benefits of the rather stable and successful economy and of course apartheid was anti-democratic because there were far fewer white people than black people apartheid is gone and without constitutional protections and with that kind of race baiting I don't think this small white minority has much of a future there and it sounded fairly obvious just even from that trailer that they don't even think so - it's it's quite sad I don't think the world gives a damn certainly not the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Teresa May who recently went on a trip to Africa I didn't say a cross word about this oh by the way I didn't mention that extremist politician break away from the ANC in in South Africa the South Africans Parliament is bringing in legislation for expropriation without compensation so just take the land away from the white farmers to take it don't have to pay him anything just steal it and it's shocking legislation not a word against it by Theresa May in fact sort of the opposite Teresa Maine pledging billions in foreign aid I want to make things a little more lighthearted now after that very very heavy trailer and let me show you and what can you do but laugh what are you gonna do except for laughs Teresa made perhaps the weakest Prime Minister in the UK since Chamberlain and that's an insult to Chamberlain because I wouldn't necessarily say he was weak I said he just made one huge mistake and by the way after Chamberlain sold out Czechoslovakia and said peace in our time once he realized the gravity of his error he came around and actually worked loyally with Winston Churchill's so Neville Chamberlain whose name is synonymous with cowardice and appeasement I don't think you can say his entire life was Carrodus I think it was a moment of self delusion and grave error in judgment and there was you know selling out Czechoslovakia this is surely an unforgivable act as well but I don't think there is anyone quite as weak as Theresa May but let me show you the image that once you see you just can't unsee it this is Teresa May busting a move take a look it looked like she had like a palsy of some sort whenever I saw someone like that I think they're having an epileptic attack yet get them a ruler higher education so they don't bite off their tongue kids I don't know if you know this it's just a little bit of home wisdom if you see someone having an epileptic attack take anything like a ruler a pen clarinet Rouge because otherwise there's a routine you know you could god forbid an epileptic can can bite off their tongue so someone should have just you know maybe she had some sort of tropical disease out can we watch that one more time Theresa May I mean she makes a lane of Seinfeld look like a prima ballerina you put your right hand in can you give me the audio you put your right hand in you put your right hand up you put your right hand and you shake it all about you do the Hokey Pokey you turn yourself around that's what it's all about sexy that's a mating dance that's her in Kenya on August 30th what are you gonna say the only thing more embarrassing perhaps is justin trudeau dancing Bangla style because because the Bhangra dancing by Justin Trudeau was not even like that was at least at a dance they were playing music they were sort of saying come on let's get into it Justin Trudeau's sort of inflicted his dancing on people all right well now I know what to picture in my mind when I'm trying to delay a moment of ecstasy we don't need that personal information but we'll just that's about the most unappealing image I can imagine angry Kate Warner will you comment about the monkeys and children at Queen's Park yes I'll do my show on that tonight for those in Canada mmm Doug Ford the duly-elected Premier of Ontario has decided to the City of Toronto does not need 47 city councilors and you know what I Green Los Angeles is 15 Boston has 14 Dallas has 14 these are large important successful cities Toronto has 47 for a population of 2.8 million it's not even a population thing I mean you just can't have 47 people running a city when they're all basically one-man parties that everyone has to have a say on everything everyone's a faction everyone is showboating and nothing gets done Doug Ford wants to reduce that to 25 still almost double Boston Dallas LA Seattle in Canada provinces have the diction to amande cities if their cities are called creatures of the province citizens they're controlled and owned by the provinces and dug for did so but a radical judge who by the way this radical judge is the same way same one who denied omar Cotters victims grieving family the right to sue omekata for the money that he got from justin trudeau the same radical judge since our doug ford you can't reduce the number of city politicians back before it's gonna use to notwithstanding clause so the opposition parties are literally having tantrums shouting screaming pounding on desks i don't think it's gonna work with the public I don't think that us-style resistance style semi riding style is gonna go over with the public I think Canadians are sort of done with that I hope I hope I saw today a story in Bloomberg can we call up that Bloomberg story I tweeted it about an hour ago Bloomberg as you know is a news corporation with a business focus but now it's in politics too named after Michael Bloomberg the founder of it based in New York of course and they have a headline about the looming Quebec election I see some super chests I'll come back to them in a moment don't you worry party vowing to curb immigration favored to win Quebec election let me read those sub headlines there caq coalition Alvo near into Quebec that means the future coalition of Quebec is ahead in the polls for the October 1st Canadian provincial votes dissatisfaction with Liberals runs high despite economic gains yeah I mean this is where that open border of every scammer and schemer and bogus migrant that Donald Trump is deport and they're all walking across to Quebec so look my point is calling people race as shenanigans it's not working anymore Quebec is about to vote if this headline holds up if these polls hold up for a populist nationalist Democratic Party throwing out the left-wing glow those parties and I give that to you as evidence the people are just sick of the media party the political media globalist establishment that says no you shut up you racists open borders are good crime is fine I think Quebec is starting to speak backwards ironic is I have to read about it in the new york-based Bloomberg because the Canadian media will never tell you that I see a Nigel a surgeon or was generous enough to chip in 50 bucks that's amazing Nigel by the way thank you very much for that unbelievable and and I want to say thanks again to Blaine Sandburg for doing the same now I just says didn't Zimbabwe take land away from farmers and liens collapsed you're exactly right we've seen this movie before and for the same reasons I mean you can talk about decolonization and you can talk about local sovereignty and autonomy and you can talk about racial equity and things of that sort but this is nothing more than vengeance and theft it was shrouded by in the language of economic justice but where's your economic justice when you all starve because the one thing about the Boers is they know how to farm they've been doing it for centuries and you steal a man's farm and you give it to someone as a prize they don't have a farm farming isn't as easy as it looks farming is a science and an art it's a skill it's years of experience and wisdom it's knowing every hill and stream and curve and the quirks of your land and the quirks of the seasons you can't just steal a man's farm that he's had in the family for two or three hundred years and give it to the thugs you saw the thugs and use that word because they're saying shoot the bull or bang bang so you give your paramilitaries their farm it'll be overgrown in weeds in weeks and y'all going to starve I guess you can ask for foreign aid from Theresa May and a herky-jerky you know with that dance Miley Cyrus is dad Billy Ray the Macarena or my Achy Breaky Heart the herky-jerky dance that Theresa May was too and I'm like God I'm sorry for that ramble hey speaking of dancing I can I show you a couple of dance moves the left for some reason I think is more artistic than the right would you agree with me there are some great artists on the right it's true and there are some on the left who have no artistic but I just think in general I don't know why it is I don't know why but artists tend to be on the left or maybe it's it may be if you're an artist you're sort of forced to be on the left um I think artists and left us there sometimes cooler I don't know why but I want to show you the least cool liberals you're ever gonna meet in your life Theresa May was just an embarrassment but let me show you some New York liberals I don't know if you know this but an actress from about 20 years ago about 20 years ago there was a show called Sex in the City fifteen years ago I guess and um one of the actresses it was named Cynthia Nixon I don't know what character she played on the show one of the one of the single women she is a real life person of course the actress and she is running to be the governor of New York and she has no hope because New York is such a you know if you've ever read Plunket of Tammany Hall you know that the Machine politics of New York unless you're part of the system you have no chance so she's running against Governor Cuomo she has no chance but some you'd think you're a Hollywood celebrity actress who is in Sex in the City in Manhattan and Democrat you'd think you'd have some moves right and then there's Alexandria okay zo Cortez who looks sort of half I think and then there's an attorney general candidate named Zephyr Teachout so these are like if your name is Zephyr like if your mom and dad named you Zephyr which means a breeze and you kept that name and you were stood it you'd think you'd be sort of hip you think you'd dance beautifully let me show Cynthia Nixon Alexandra occasional cook days and Zephyr Teachout dancing in an homage to Theresa May or something take a look the one in the gray jacket and the Cynthia Nixon to the left and there's Alexandria okay Joe Cortez I think she's dancing okay but Cynthia Nixon is back is to the camera now am I wrong is she an awful cringy dancer I just thought I'd show you a politician's dancing it's never a pretty sight you know what I'm not gonna inflict it on you now and I'm sure our producers don't have it handy but there's a video in fact you want to try and find it Jason Kenney at Caribana it is you know I'll stop picking on Democrats Jason Kenney dancing and Caribana your eyes will burn I'm gonna get to the super chats that I've been missing but before I want to show you Hillary Clinton dancing with Bill Clinton and this was a couple years back and it's unbelievable here's Hillary Clinton and Bill perhaps the whitest women in politics moves on it that's the white woman on the favorite planet moves around and now by them perhaps the whitest woman in the world who has not had their skin but perhaps the whitest women the world was not covered in cotton powder but do we have the clip of her dancing with bill oh we don't have it handy you know it actually was the next one if we can find it it was on that same website that wasn't that bad that was her just doing the hand dancing kind of thing which is a mercy but she was dancing with Bill Clinton and it was just incredible let's show Jason Kennedy I want to be an equal opportunity dance mocker and that's John Tory by the way what is that what is that this is a strange mating ritual indeed the male of the species peacocks the male of the species all two males are quarreling over a mate show that again because I'm gonna I'm gonna narrate honey badger style the males of the species size each other up like Bucks who will be dominant who will win the affections of the female Jason Kenney and John Tory thrust themselves about and work their hips whilst the female shows the prize to be won by who will be the dull I get a stop right there merci merci okay let's say you know what I just wished that if this were not live chat I would say to the team can we delete everything we've shown for the last five minutes let me read some super chats saint-jean dark chips in five bucks Maxine Burnie announced People's Party of Canada today it's grassroots supporters phenomenal he's going to make a dent in this election I've reached out to Maxime twice to invite him to come for an interview I'll reach out a third time funky monkey says great work Ezra I'm sure you wrote that before I showed you all those dance clips for which I apologize Michael a high as reduce states in the US have constitutional authority over municipalities as provinces in Canada have oh boy you know I don't even want to guess I would I would imagine because the United States Constitution tilts towards states rights more than Canada in fact in Canada if there's any ambiguity it's resolved in favor of the federal government let me just check if I've answered all the all the super sir I think I've caught up on the super chance will you guys forgive me for showing you all those awful dance moves actually

just will not look at Hillary's looking at any other woman in the room feel is worse where dem interns where's Epstein I want to fly to his Island on the jet yeah I tell you I I've never seen a bigger contract this is so this singers singing with the soul of Aretha and then you've never seen a lamer pair than Hillary and Bill each thinking about someone else bill thinking about the intern of the

should it's like a it says like a big poncho she wears these ponchos and there's you know it's a lot of chitchat on the internet that it's to hide some medical device I find that credible can we can we call up the video of her on 9/11 September 11 2016 when she was the 9/11 ceremony in New York and suddenly felt faint and left quickly to go to her limo and she almost fell over I'm going to show you and it was there that questions about her health really broke through from the internet into the mainstream media because that ain't normal what happened to her in this play that last video if we can find it mmm oh here's AI here we have this plan so there she is in the blonde hair leaning up against the pole she's leaning up against a Ballard and then watch this she's literally lifted lifted wobbling what she's lifted by two men and whoa she falls and she's thrown into the truck The Secret Service blocking the shot she was whisked away to a private clinic and by the way one of her shoes was left on the curb that was only filmed by a quick-witted pedestrian because the rest of the media was utterly incurious okay there is one more dance video you're gonna see I see it mentioned by v6 as we're dancing to what the Fox said in the Sun News studio I love that you know I'm a terrible dancer terrible I wouldn't make John Tory and Jason Kenney look like the Baryshnikov's that they were in their own minds that day but I've had what I lack in talent I make up for with enthusiasm and therefore in the closing minutes of today's unusual show I present to you me singing what did the Fox
