This home has been empty for
the past six years.
it is in Namie, a small town
in Fukushima Prefecture,
where an earthquake and tsunami
triggered a nuclear meltdown
at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
power plant in 2011.
Pachinko parlors, popular
gambling sites in Tomioka,
another town evacuated because
of the high radiation levels,
have not yet been cleaned up
after the earthquake toppled
money buckets to the floor.
We came upon this eerie scene
at an empty ramen restaurant,
where the dishes were left in
the sink and the menus are
strewn along the counter.
In a graveyard along the coast,
damage from the earthquake and
tsunami six years ago remains.
The plant and its surrounding
areas are the site of the
world's largest ongoing nuclear
waste cleanup.
Containing the radiated 
material is a
problem with no end in sight.
Thousands of bags of
contaminated soil are piled
high across the prefecture.
After being exposed 
to radiation,
fields were scraped
of their soil and trees cut at
the stump.
In the town of Namie,
not far from the plant,
this house is being demolished.
Its owners have decided to
>settle elsewhere.
The materials of the home
with risk of contamination,
are being packed 
into bags
and will be stored 
in yet another lot.
The government plans to lift
the evacuation order 
this spring.
A few residents plan 
to come back.
But many others,
including those with 
young children,
will never return.
