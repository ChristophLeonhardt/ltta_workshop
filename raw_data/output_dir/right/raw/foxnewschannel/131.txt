1
00:00:00,915 --> 00:00:01,815
OUT POLITICALLY.

2
00:00:01,816 --> 00:00:03,216
>> Bill: THE ECONOMY IS COOKING.

3
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:05,819
>> Julie: BACK TO ONE OF OUR

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,786
TOP STORIES, FORMER F.B.I.

5
00:00:06,787 --> 00:00:08,154
ATTORNEY JAMES BAKER SOON TO

6
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:11,458
REAPPEAR BEFORE THE HOUSE

7
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:12,859
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR ANOTHER

8
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,561
HIGH STAKES HEARING.

9
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:16,429
HE WILL FACE TOUGH QUESTIONS

10
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,264
ABOUT DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

11
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:20,400
ROD ROSENSTEIN AND THE WIRETAP

12
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:20,733
CLAIMS.

13
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:21,801
LET'S BRING IN CONGRESSMAN JIM

14
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:24,370
JORDAN WHO WILL BE IN THAT ROOM

15
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:24,971
ASKING QUESTIONS TODAY.

16
00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:25,872
CONGRESSMAN ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE

17
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:29,142
YOU AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

18
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:32,278
I SHOULD NOTE THAT IT'S

19
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,713
INTERESTING TO MAKE NOTE THAT

20
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:36,816
BAKER HAD A CLOSE WORKING

21
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:38,718
RELATIONSHIP TO JAMES COMEY

22
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,353
BEFORE HE LEFT THE BUREAU.

23
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:41,888
YOU'LL BE IN TODAY'S CLOSED

24
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:42,322
DOOR MEETINGS.

25
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,090
WHAT QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE FOR

26
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,291
JAMES BAKER?

27
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:47,627
>> WHERE WE START IS ANDREW

28
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:50,396
MCCABE, LISA PAGE MET WITH ROD

29
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:51,231
ROSENSTEIN WHERE MR. ROSENSTEIN

30
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:52,866
SAID HE WAS THINKING ABOUT

31
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,033
ACTUALLY RECORDING THE

32
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:54,868
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IN THE OVAL

33
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:55,635
OFFICE, RECORDING THE PRESIDENT

34
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:56,870
OF THE UNITED STATES.

35
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:02,041
RIGHT AFTER THAT MEETING MR.

36
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:04,410
MCCABE AND MIZ PAGE TALK TO JIM

37
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:10,283
BAKER AND HE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY.

38
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:11,651
WAS THERE A LEGAL ANALYSIS

39
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:12,418
LOOKING TO RECORD THE PRESIDENT

40
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:13,853
OF THE UNITED STATES.

41
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:15,255
WHAT SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS TOOK

42
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:15,555
PLACE?

43
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:17,357
THOSE ARE THE FIRST SERIES OF

44
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:18,525
QUESTIONS WE'LL ASK MR. BAKER.

45
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:19,692
THEN A HOST OF OTHER THINGS WE

46
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:21,127
HAVE TO GET TO AS WELL.

47
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:21,828
>> Julie: RIGHT.

48
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:22,996
SO IN JUST ABOUT 30 MINUTES

49
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,497
FROM NOW YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE

50
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,499
TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS.

51
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,102
HE WILL BE TESTIFYING AFTER

52
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:30,270
SOME EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY

53
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:32,739
YESTERDAY WHERE HE BASICALLY

54
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,841
CALLED THE RUSSIA PROBE BEING

55
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:36,242
HANDLED IN AN ABNORMAL FASHION

56
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:38,611
AND ALSO MENTIONED THAT IT

57
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:39,279
REFLECTED POLITICAL BIAS.

58
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,513
THAT'S A QUOTE.

59
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:42,315
THIS IS NO SURPRISE.

60
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:44,284
I'M NOT SURE IF DEMOCRATS SEEM

61
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:46,786
SURPRISED BY THIS GIVEN THE

62
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:49,822
PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE

63
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:50,123
TEXTS.

64
00:01:50,124 --> 00:01:51,291
IS POLITICAL BIAS ENOUGH TO

65
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:52,392
DERAIL THE MUELLER PROBE?

66
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:54,794
>> I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING

67
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:55,929
THAT YESTERDAY ROD ROSENSTEIN

68
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,830
HAS TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH THE

69
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,232
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" AND DO AN

70
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:03,303
INTERVIEW WHERE HE SAYS THE

71
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:03,870
MUELLER INVESTIGATION

72
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,405
APPROPRIATE AND MOVING IN THE

73
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:05,872
RIGHT DIRECTION.

74
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:08,074
AND YET I CAN'T COME TALK TO

75
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:09,575
CONGRESS ABOUT THE IDEA THAT HE

76
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:10,176
MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT

77
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:12,946
RECORDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE

78
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:13,646
UNITED STATES?

79
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:14,714
ROSENSTEIN IS THE GUY WHO

80
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,215
PICKED MUELLER IN THE FIRST

81
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:16,516
PLACE.

82
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:19,118
THAT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING

83
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:19,419
PART.

84
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,987
YOU HAVE TIME FOR AN INTERVIEW

85
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:23,323
WHERE YOU SAY THE MUELLER

86
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:24,257
INVESTIGATION IS APPROPRIATE

87
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:25,458
AND INDEPENDENT BUT YOU CAN'T

88
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:26,459
ANSWER CONGRESS ABOUT WHAT YOU

89
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,127
SAID IN A MEETING AT THE HEAD

90
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,662
OF THE DEPUTY F.B.I. WHEN HE

91
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:32,699
WAS ACTING HEAD OF THE F.B.I.

92
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,033
BECAUSE MR. COMEY WAS FIRED BY

93
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,134
THE MEMO YOU WROTE.

94
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:36,936
THE FACT THAT HE WAS A NO SHOW

95
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,204
LAST WEEK IS NOT RIGHT.

96
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:42,308
HE IS OBLIGATED WHEN THE

97
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:45,144
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE THAT

98
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:45,845
HAS JURISDICTION OVER YOUR

99
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,214
AGENCY ASKS YOU TO COME TO

100
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:49,382
CONGRESS AND TESTIFY YOU ARE

101
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:51,050
SUPPOSED TO DO IT UNDER OATH

102
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:52,685
AND HE WAS A NO SHOW BUT HAS

103
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,787
TIME TO TALK TO THE PRESS ABOUT

104
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:55,421
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

105
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,456
GIVE ME A BREAK.

106
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,857
>> Julie: HIS INTERVIEW WITH

107
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,425
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"

108
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:01,561
DEFENDS THE MUELLER PROBE CALLS

109
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:04,998
IT APPROPRIATE AND INDEPENDENT

110
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,532
PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO BE

111
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:06,933
FRUSTRATED.

112
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:07,467
I CAN ACCEPT THAT.

113
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:09,936
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE

114
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:12,171
PUBLIC WILL HAVE CONFIDENCE THE

115
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,106
CASES WE BROUGHT WERE WARRANTED

116
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:15,274
BY THE EVIDENCE AND IT WAS AN

117
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:18,244
APPROPRIATE USE OF RESOURCES.

118
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,479
I HAVE A SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY

119
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,314
TO MAKE SURE CASES ARE PURSUED

120
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:22,949
AND PROSECUTED AND PLEASED THE

121
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,151
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE

122
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:25,518
OF THAT.

123
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,286
IF YOU GOT A CHANCE TO

124
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:28,221
INTERVIEW ROSENSTEIN WHAT WOULD

125
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:29,622
YOU ASK HIM?

126
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:31,791
>> TALK ABOUT FRUSTRATING.

127
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,894
WHY HASN'T HE GIVEN US THE

128
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:38,131
MCCABE MEMOS WE SUB AOEN ADD

129
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,667
AND THE 302 FROM BRUCE OHR AND

130
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:43,069
OPEN THE FISA APPLICATION THAT

131
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,504
CHAIRMAN NUNES TALKED ABOUT AND

132
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:45,672
AN UPDATE FROM THE U.S.

133
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:48,007
ATTORNEY LOOKING INTO THINGS

134
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:49,175
THAT WENT ON IN THE F.B.I.

135
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:50,843
WE DON'T GET ALL THAT

136
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:51,611
INFORMATION THAT WE'RE ENTITLED

137
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,546
TO GET AS A SEPARATE AND EQUAL

138
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:55,314
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND HE IS

139
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,450
A NO SHOW AND GLENN SIMPSON

140
00:03:57,451 --> 00:03:58,851
TAKES THE FIFTH.

141
00:03:58,852 --> 00:03:59,352
WE'RE FRUSTRATED.

142
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:00,720
I WANT HIM TO COME IN TO ANSWER

143
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,455
LOTS OF QUESTIONS LIKE ABOUT

144
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:04,490
THE DOCUMENTS AND REQUESTS WE

145
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:05,892
HAVE OUTSTANDING BUT MOST

146
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,027
IMPORTANTLY ABOUT THIS

147
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,228
CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH ANDY

148
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,630
MCCABE WHERE HE SAID HE WAS

149
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,632
THINKING OF RECORDING THE

150
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,635
PRESIDENT.

151
00:04:15,636 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Julie: GOOD LUCK THIS
