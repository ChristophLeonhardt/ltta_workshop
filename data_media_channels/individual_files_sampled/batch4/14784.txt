there has been a lot of Twitter controversy digging up old tweets and calling for firings and backlash this all stems from the left conservatives have been attacked relentlessly the past few years I know this personally they dig up anything from your past take it out of context even comedians can't even make jokes without the left taking it out of context losing their humor and calling them racist many people including Roseanne have lost work from this I have lost work from this it has turned into digging up anyone's tweets recently and we have found a lot of people in Hollywood with sketchy tweets and it has caused a lot of controversy the past few days there has been another controversy involving a woman that has been hired at the New York Times her name is Sarah John tweets of hers have service that are extremely racist let's take a look at some of them oh man it's kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men white people have stopped breeding you'll all go extinct soon this was my plan all along dumb effing white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants our white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the Sun thus logically being old II fit to live underground like grovelling goblins hashtag cancel white people at first I wasn't really interested in looking at more of this Twitter drama and pointing fingers because we do have the right of freedom of speech and this controversy can either go any way either you support freedom of speech or you want to play the left scam and start attacking the way that we have been attacked however her tweets are quite damning they aren't no doubt racist she claims not to be embarrassed by these tweets and did not even bother deleting them amidst backlash the New York Times published a statement defending her this is what they have to say John's journalism and the fact that she's a young Asian woman have made her a subject of frequent online harassment for a period of time she responded to that harass by imitating the rhetoric of her harassers she was not imitating the rhetoric of her harassers she was being anti white and racist flat-out no context just pumping out racist comments on Twitter with no backlash no wonder the New York Times defends Sarah within the past 24 hours they published an article that is titled Hollywood is as white straight and male as ever the left are defending her saying Sarah Jang is good her haters are bad terrible even it's not difficult the New York Times and the left together are defending her claiming that her statements are a result of white people that's right white people and white supremacy however John is a Harvard graduate people are saying that the right are taking her tweets out of context and that they are just jokes however she is not a comedian and suddenly the left have gained their context and humor back when it is convenient for them however lose all context and humor when right-wingers and like Roseanne make a joke the left have defended this racism and claim that if you attack it you are the bigot I am all for freedom of speech but I would like one rule for all of this the left cannot have both ways we can either condemn all of it as racism and acknowledge it for what it is or we are all allowed to speak freely without censorship and worry about getting fired if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
