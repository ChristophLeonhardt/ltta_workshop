00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,809
ANOTHER TREMENDOUS VICTORY FOR 

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,079
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,914
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 

5
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:15,147
ABOUT. 

6
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:19,285
WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF VICTORIES 

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,120
FOLKS. 

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,920
CAN YOU HANDLE IT? 

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,157
IN THE OVAL OFFICE OF THE WHITE 

10
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,993

TURKEY. 

13
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:40,506
HE IS NOW FREE FROM JAIL. 

14
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:43,810
THINK OF THAT. 

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,011
35 YEAR JAIL SENTENCE. 

16
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:45,278
35 YEARS. 

17
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,114
NOT ANYMORE. 

18
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,617
HE'S BACK WITH HIS FAMILY. 

19
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:54,287
TOGETHER, WITH HIS WIFE. 

20
00:00:54,287 --> 00:01:02,228
AND, HE IS ON AMERICAN SOIL. 

21
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:08,434
AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. 

22
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,069
THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER. 

23
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,470
THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER. 

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,606
WASN'T EASY. 

25
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,141
WASN'T EASY. 

26
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,744
THAT WASN'T WASN'T EASY. 

27
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:24,284
AND WE DON'T PAY RANSOM. 

28
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:35,962
WE DON'T PAY RANSOM.

29
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,932
I THINK WE WILL ESTABLISH A 

30
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,799
GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH TURKEY. 

31
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,199

37
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:12,832
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT 

38
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:13,065
FLORIDA.

39
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:15,001
ALMOST 200 MILES AN HOUR. 

40
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,670
ONE OF THE MOST VICIOUS WE HAVE 

41
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,338
EVER BEEN HIT WITH. 

42
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,275
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF 

43
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:22,842

THE PEOPLE OF FEMA. 

45
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:30,917
THE FIRST RESPONDERS. 

46
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:31,550
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

47
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,389
AND ALL OF THE THOUSANDS OF 

48
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:36,822

ELECTRIC TRUCKS ALL LINED UP. 

55
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,537
THEY'RE GETING THE ROADS 

56
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:51,804
CLEARED. 

57
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:52,104
NOT EASY. 

58
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:55,107
AND THEY HAVE DONE SOME JOB. 

59
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,242
600,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRIC 

60
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,878
IN ONE DAY. 

61
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,015
THEY GOT IT DOWN TO 250,000. 

62
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,082
THAT'S SOME JOB. 

63
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,418
ONE DAY. 

64
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,787

65
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:08,988
JOB IS DONE. 

66
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:15,695
WE'RE HERE TONIGHT TO DISCUSS 

67
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,496
EVERYTHING WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED 

68
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:24,137
TOGETHER IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS 

69
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:24,337
TIME. 

70
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:24,670
THINK OF IT. 

71
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,040
AND I'M HERE TONIGHT, ALTHOUGH 

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,746
I'VE BEEN BACK MANY TIMES, I 

73
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,248
LOVE THIS STATE. 

74
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,583
TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY 

75
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:37,883
FOR 2016. 

76
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:47,660
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG 

77
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:47,927
FOR THAT. 

78
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,796
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG 

79
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,063
FOR THAT. 

80
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,798
REMEMBER, THE VOTE IS IN, THE 

81
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:52,932
POLLS ARE CLOSED IN KENTUCKY. 

82
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:57,103
DONALD TRUMP IS THE WINNER OF 

83
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,139
KENTUCKY. 

84
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,777
THAT WAS FAST. 

85
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,511
THAT WAS FAST. 

86
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:09,082
AND, TO MAKE SURE THAT 

87
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,085
AMERICA'S EXTRAORDINARY 

88
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,022
COMEBACK, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 

89
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,356
IT GOES FULL SPEED AHEAD. 

90
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,425
WE DON'T WANT DEMOCRATS COMING 

91
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,259
FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE. 

92
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,364
WE DON'T WANT THEM GETTING IN 

93
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,064
OFFICE. 

94
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,431
ALL THEY'LL DO IS OBSTRUCT. 

95
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:30,069
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, 

96
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,272
AMERICA IS BOOMING. 

97
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:37,043
IT'S THRIVING. 

98
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,778
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN 

99
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:47,854
BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING 

100
00:04:47,854 --> 00:05:02,335
AMERICA FIRST. 

101
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:17,350
[ CHANTING USA ] OUR COUNTRY'S 

102
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,887
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS JUST 

103
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,254
FALLEN TO 3.7%. 

104
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,491
THE LOWEST IN OVER 50 YEARS. 

105
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:32,064
50 YEARS. 

106
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:36,702
MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS 

107
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:38,504
REACHED AN ALL-TIME HIGH. 

108
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,172
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 

109
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:39,806
THAT MEANS YOU'RE MAKING MORE 

110
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,573
MONEY THAN YOU EVER MADE 

111
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:40,806
BEFORE. 

112
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:42,108
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH BETTER 

113
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,977
BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET IT UP 

114
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,113
HIGHER. 

115
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:55,121
WE HAVE ELIMINATED A RECORD 

116
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,357
NUMBER OF JOB KILLING 

117
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,158
REGULATIONS. 

118
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,993
AND SOME OF YOU WILL LOVE THIS 

119
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,628
AND I'M PROUD OF IT. 

120
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:02,995
GREAT PEOPLE. 

121
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:07,467
A GREAT RESOURCE WHEN PROPERLY 

122
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:07,667
USED. 

123
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,671
WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON CLEAN, 

124
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:21,314
BEAUTIFUL COAL. 

125
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,150
WE'RE PUTTING OUR MINERS BACK 

126
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,553
TO WORK LIKE NEVER BEFORE. 

127
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,988
THEY'RE GOING BACK, BACK, BACK. 

128
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,325
AND AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING 

129
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:38,965
OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY 

130
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,700
REBUILDING OUR NATION. 

131
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,603
AND WE ARE DOING IT WITH 

132
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,270
AMERICAN IRON, ALUMINUM, AND 

133
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,839
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO STEEL. 

134
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,542
YOU SEE THE COMEBACK WITH 

135
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:49,775
STEEL? 

136
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,744
EVERYONE'S GOING BACK TO WORK. 

137
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:56,416
THE STEEL MILLS ARE OPENING UP. 

138
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:56,716
U.S. STEL. 

139
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,117
THEY'RE ALL OPENING UP THEIR 

140
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:58,450
STEEL MILLS. 

141
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,586
THAT WAS FASTER THAN I THOUGHT. 

142
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,988
AND WE'RE STOPPING THE DUMPING. 

143
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,422
IF THEY WANT TO DUMP, THEY CAN, 

144
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:08,094
BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY A LOT. 

145
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:14,467
SO, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, SO 

146
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:14,667
TRUE. 

147
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,835
DESPITE OUR SIZE, AMERICA IS 

148
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,272
NOW THE HOTTEST COUNTRY 

149
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,106
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 

150
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:25,044
THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO 

151
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:25,210
BE. 

152
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:32,985
SINCE MY ELECTION, WE PICKED UP 

153
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:39,091
IN WORTH, $11.7 TRILLION. 

154
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:39,458
THINK OF THAT. 

155
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,527
AND WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG 

156
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:41,960
GREAT WITH CHINA. 

157
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,529
WE'RE DOING THINGS WITH CHINA 

158
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,997
AND THEY DROPPED ABOUT 20 

159
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:45,263
TRILLION. 

160
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:45,697
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 

161
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,967
THEY'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE. 

162
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,870
BUT THEY HAVE TO TREAT US 

163
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,103
FAIRLY. 

164
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:56,275
THEY HAVE TO TREAT US FAIRLY. 

165
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:56,508
RIGHT? 

166
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,377
THAT'S RIGHT. 

167
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:06,184
AND EVERY DAY, WE ARE LIVING BY 

168
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:09,088
OUR MOTTO. 

169
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:09,455
PROMISES MADE. 

170
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:29,542
PROMISES KEPT.

171
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,980
AND YOU LOOK AT THE TAKE NEWS 

172
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,748
MEDIA. 

173
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:36,081
LOOK AT THEM. 

174
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:36,414
LOOK AT THEM. 

175
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,349
IT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS 

176
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,717
EVERY TIME. 

177
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:40,186
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO WALK INTO 

178
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:45,891
A PLACE ONE NIGHT AND NOT HAVE 

179
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,625
ANY OF THESE GUYS. 

180
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:51,630
BOY, IT GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER. 

181
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,732
BUT, EVEN THEY HAVE SAID THAT 

182
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,534
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND YOU KNOW, 

183
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,069
THEY PROBABLY GET FIRED THE 

184
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,606
NEXT DAY, THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

185
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,574
MADE PROMISES DURING THE 

186
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,777
CAMPAIGN AND I'VE ACTUALLY 

187
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,545
PRODUCED MORE THAN THE PROMISES 

188
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,981
I MADE. 

189
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,450
HOW OFTEN DO YOU HEAR THAT? 

190
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,121
AND WE ALL PRODUCED IT 

191
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:15,388
TOGETHER. 

192
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,555
WE HAVE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 

193
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:16,922
MITCH AND RAND. 

194
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:17,989
WE ALL PRODUCED IT TOGETHER. 

195
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,625
WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM. 

196
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,428
BUT, WE NEED MORE OF THEM. 

197
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,065
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES. 

198
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,800
WE HAVE A MAJORITY THAT'S 

199
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,701
ESSENTIALLY RAND, NOT A 

200
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,068
MAJORITY. 

201
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,569
IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, WE 

202
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,403
DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY, RIGHT? 

203
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,373
SO WE HAVE TO GET SOME MORE 

204
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:34,973
REPUBLICANS IN THERE. 

205
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:40,179
AND WE'RE HERE FOR SOME GOOD 

206
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:40,512
ONES TONIGHT. 

207
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,382
ON MONDAY NIGHT, AT THE WHITE 

208
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:43,783
HOUSE. 

209
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:48,788
WE KEPT ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND 

210
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:49,622
MOST HISTORIC PROMISES OF ALL. 

211
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,991
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING 

212
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,424
ABOUT, RIGHT? 

213
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:57,430
NEVER HAS A MAN BEEN TREATED SO 

214
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,830
BADLY. 

215
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,898
AMERICA WATCHED AS WE PROUDLY 

216
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,200
SWORE IN THE NEWEST MEMBER OF 

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,071
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 

218
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:05,304
COURT. 

219
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:21,721
JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

220
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,288
A GREAT, GREAT GENTLEMAN. 

221
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,557
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM WAS SO 

222
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:24,790
UNFAIR. 

223
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,758
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 

224
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:25,925
IT. 

225
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,094
AND WE STUCK WITH HIM ALL THE 

226
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:28,594
WAY. 

227
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,194
BECAUSE WE KNEW THE FACTS. 

228
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:35,901
WE STUCK WITH HIM ALL THE WAY. 

229
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,737
AND RAND PAUL, AND MEMBERSHIP. 

230
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:39,872
THEY STUCK WITH HIM. 

231
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:45,077
NO DOUBTS ABOUT IT. 

232
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:45,377
NO DOUBTS. 

233
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,012
REMEMBER THAT. 

234
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,081
REMEMBER THAT. 

235
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:53,119
HE NOW SITS ALONGSIDE JUSTICE 

236
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,455
NEIL GORSUCH TO DEFEND YOUR 

237
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:05,331
SACRED RIGHTS AND YOUR GOD GIVEN

238
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:05,597
FREEDOM. 

239
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:07,133
WHA THE CRAZY RADICAL 

240
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,068
DEMOCRATS DID TO JUSTICE 

241
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,304
KAVANAUGH IS A NATIONAL 

242
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:12,571
DISGRACE. 

243
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,374
FROM THE MOMENT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

244
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,844
WAS KNOWN, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT 

245
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,144
HAPPENED. 

246
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:19,544
WE NOMINATED HIM. 

247
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:22,214
AND LITERALLY FROM THE MOMENT 

248
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,515
HE WAS NOMINATED, THEY DIDN'T 

249
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:23,815
EVEN KNOW. 

250
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:26,986
IT'S ACTUALLY, IF YOU THINK OF 

251
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,955
IT, IT'S FROM BEFORE HE WAS 

252
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:30,255
NOMINATED. 

253
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,724
NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT WHO 

254
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,293
IT WAS GOING TO BE. 

255
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:38,197
I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE MY DECISION 

256
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,498
YET AND THEY STARTED SAYING 

257
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,100
HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT WHOEVER 

258
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,568
THE PERSON MIGHT BE. 

259
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:48,240
THEY WERE ON A MISSION TO 

260
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,275
OBSTRUCT, RESIST, DELAY, 

261
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,411
DEMOLISH, AND DESTROY. 

262
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,916
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME 

263
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,551
TOTALLY CONSUMED BY THEIR 

264
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,187
CHILLING LUST FOR POWER. 

265
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,088
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. 

266
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:06,492
WE HAVE A MAN, ONE OF THE MOST 

267
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:15,267
POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD, IT'S 

268
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:15,901
OKAY, COMES FROM KENTUCKY. 

269
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,168
NOT BAD. 

270
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,169
AND HE HEARD ABOUT THIS. 

271
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,040
HE SAID I WANT TO BE THERE. 

272
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,607
HE'S ONE OF YOURS. 

273
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,444
HE'S JOINING US TONIGHT. 

274
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:25,978
HE'S ROCK RIBBED. 

275
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:26,378
KENTUCKY LEADER. 

276
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:32,718
HE'S BEEN A LEADER FOR A LONG 

277
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,085
TIME. 

278
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,985
THERE'S NOBODY TOUGHER. 

279
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:34,519
THERE'S NOBODY SMARTER. 

280
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,490
HE REFUSED TO CAVE TO THE 

281
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,628
RADICAL DEMOCRATS' SHAMEFUL 

282
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,097
CAMPAIGN OF POLITICAL AND 

283
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:45,564
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION. 

284
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,667
HE STARED DOWN TOUGH COOKIE. 

285
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,368
I KNOW TOUGH PEOPLE. 

286
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:49,701
HE'S TOUGH. 

287
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,103
HE'S KENTUCKY TOUGH WHICH IS 

288
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:57,076
ABOUT AS TOUGH AS IT GETS. 

289
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:01,814
HE STARED DOWN THE ANGRY LEFT 

290
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,081
WING MOB. 

291
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,150
HE NEVER BLINKED AND HE NEVER 

292
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,752
LOOKED BACK AND HE GOT US A MAN 

293
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:15,193

00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,738
BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

374
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,005
COUNTRY. 

375
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:53,805
WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS. 

376
00:17:53,805 --> 00:18:05,117
WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL 

377
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,821
MANDATE.

378
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:13,192
WE HAD OBAMA CARE REPEALED AND 

379
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:13,459
REPLACED. 

380
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,259
WE DIDN'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT 

381
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:15,460
VOTE. 

382
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,196
BUT WE'LL GET IT DONE. 

383
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,864
WE HAD A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT 

384
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,965
THAT NIGHT. 

385
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,234
A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAPPOINT. 

386
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,135
BUT, IT'S ESSENTIALLY DONE 

387
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:23,401
ANYWAY. 

388
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,604
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET RID OF THE 

389
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,371
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, IT'S DONE. 

390
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,908
AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE 

391
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,744
REMNANT OF OBAMA CARE IS KEPT 

392
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,646
YOUR PREMIUMS DOWN BELOW WHAT 

393
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,082
ANYBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 

394
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:41,820
THROUGH GOOD MANAGEMENT. 

395
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,924
THROUGH SECRETARY ALEX AZAR. 

396
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,827
NOW A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS 

397
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:49,962
HELPED US SO MUCH. 

398
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,395
HE'S REALLY SMART. 

399
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,930
BUT I HAVE TO SAY HIS WIFE THE 

400
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,565
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAS BECOME 

401
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,668
MAYBE THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE 

402
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:56,901
FAMILY. 

403
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,871
I SAID RAND, YOU HAVE TO GET 

404
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:03,208
HER ON TELEVISION MORE. 

405
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,078
SHE'S BECOME THE BIGGEST STAR 

406
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,314
IN THE FAMILY. 

407
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:18,490
YES. 

408
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,126
A MAN THAT HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 

409
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:21,960
FRIEND OF MINE. 

410
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,462
AND HE'S REALLY SOMETHING. 

411
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:23,862
HE'S A GREAT GUY. 

412
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,132
NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. 

413
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:31,637
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. 

414
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,004
NOT EVERYBODY. 

415
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,404
IT'S LIKE MITCH. 

416
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,039
NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS MITCH IS A 

417
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,339
GREAT GUY. 

418
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:34,939
HE'S A GREAT PEOPLE. 

419
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:35,573
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS 

420
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:41,179
TO YOU WHEN YOU GROW UP IN 

421
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,983
KENTUCKY I GUESS. 

422
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:45,216
RIGHT? 

423
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:48,787
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 

424
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,722
BUT I CALL RAND A SENATOR OF 

425
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,991
TREMENDOUS COMMON SENSE. 

426
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:57,429
THAT'S A GREAT COMPLIMENT. 

427
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,832
COMMON SENSE. 

428
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:01,867
RAND IS YOUNG AND SPRY. 

429
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,702
COME UP HERE FOR A SECOND. 

430
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:13,078
COME UP HERE. 

431
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,946
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S 

432
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:15,179
TIRED. 

433
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,381
I CAN TAKE 20 OR 30 MINUTES, 

434
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:17,615
RIGHT? 

435
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,184
NO, I'LL TELL YOU A VERY QUICK 

436
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,152
STORY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. 

437
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,219
THIS SHOWS HOW HE IS DIFFERENT 

438
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,621
FROM ANY OTHER POLITICIAN AND 

439
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,455
WHY YOU'RE ALL OUT HERE. 

440
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,825
I WENT TO HIM WITH AN IDEA ON 

441
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,158
HEALTH CARE. 

442
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:28,393
I SAID, LET'S LET INDIVIDUALS 

443
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,962
BUY IN A GROUP. 

444
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,897
LET THEM JOIN AN ASSOCIATION. 

445
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,564
LET COMPETITION DRIVE PRICES 

446
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:32,764
DOWN. 

447
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,401
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT'S A 

448
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,002
GREAT IDEA. 

449
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:37,535
WHAT DID HIS STAFF SAY? 

450
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,439
OH NO, WE COULD NEVER DO THAT. 

451
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,740
MIDDLEMANNAGEMENT SAID WE COULD 

452
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,207
NEVER DO THAT. 

453
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,643
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID MAKE IT 

454
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:57,489
SO AND HE DID IT. 

455
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,057
>> BUT IT'S TRUE, WE WERE 

456
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,092
TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND 

457
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,594
RAND HAD THIS CONCEPT THAT HE 

458
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,765
WAS SO FAR ADVANCED. 

459
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,134
EVEN THE EXPERTS DIDN'T KNOW. 

460
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,104
THEY SAID HE'S RIGHT. 

461
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:12,404
HE'S RIGHT. 

462
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,005
ASSOCIATION HEALTH CARE WHERE 

463
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,541
YOU CAN TEAM UP WITH OTHER 

464
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,075
COMPANIES. 

465
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,177
YOU TEAM UP. 

466
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,447
YOU GET PHENOMENAL PRICING. 

467
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,218
YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH 

468
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:26,618
CROSSING BORDERS. 

469
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,455
AND THAT WAS RAND'S INITIAL 

470
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,091
IDEA. 

471
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,493
THAT'S TRUE. 

472
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,395
AND IT'S DOING REALLY WELL. 

473
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:36,928
INEXPENSIVE AND TERRIFIC. 

474
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,797
AND ANOTHER MAN, A VERY SPECIAL 

475
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:45,003
FRIEND OF MINE. 

476
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,137
A GREAT BUSINESSMAN. 

477
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:47,739
DECIDED TO WIN AND RUN IN 

478
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,006
KENTUCKY. 

479
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:53,979
THIS GUY WAS REALLY A 

480
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,082
SUCCESSFUL GUY. 

481
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,584
HE SAW THINGS HAPPENING IN 

482
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,018
KENTUCKY. 

483
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:08,393
HE WANTS TO GET THE JOB DONE. 

484
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,928
YOU HAVE YOUR LOWEST YOU HAVE 

485
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,663
YOUR BEST INCOMES IN HISTORY. 

486
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,365
YOU HAVE JOBS AND COMPANIES 

487
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:18,603
FLOWING BACK IN. 

488
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,839
ALL OF THAT WOULDN'T MATTER IF 

489
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,272
I DIDN'T LIKE HIM. 

490
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:22,741
IF I DIDN'T LIKE HIM, I WOULD 

491
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,241
SAY FORGET ABOUT HIM. 

492
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,377
BUT I LIKE HIM A LOT. 

493
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:31,382
HE'S A TERRIFIC MAN AND A 

494
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:33,084
TERRIFIC GOVERNOR. 

495
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:42,427
MATT BEVIN. 

496
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:42,794
THANK YOU MATT. 

497
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:43,261
THANKS MATT. 

498
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,764
SO WE'RE HERE FOR A TRULY 

499
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,097
SPECIAL GUY. 

500
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:59,344
THESE ARE ALL SPECIAL PEOPLE. 

501
00:22:59,344 --> 00:22:59,911
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLACE. 

502
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,046
WHAT DID WE WIN BY, 38? 

503
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,681
WE WON BY A LOT. 

504
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,815
I HAVE A FEELING THAT MITCH 

505
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,952
MCCONNELL IN TWO YEARS IS GOING 

506
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,087
TO DO VERY GOOD. 

507
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:20,966
VERY GOOD. 

508
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,201
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE 

509
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:23,468
TOGETHER. 

510
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,505
BUT HE IS BETTER WHEN I WAS 

511
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,040
PRESIDENT THAN HE WAS WHEN 

512
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,607
ANYONE ELSE WAS PRESIDENT. 

513
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:35,347
DOING MUCH BETTER. 

514
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,948
BUT I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE 

515
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,417
LEADER WE ARE ALL HERE FOR 

516
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:39,684
TONIGHT. 

517
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:40,752
ALL OF THE CONGRESSMEN KNOW 

518
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,452
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. 

519
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:43,155
HE HAS BEEN SO STRONG ON ALL OF 

520
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:53,298
THE THINGS THAT WE STAND FOR. 

521
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:53,565
TAX CUTS. 

522
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:53,965
REGULATION CUTS. 

523
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:57,135
EVERY SINGLE THING WE PASS. 

524
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:12,751
HE HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT. 

525
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,021
THE DEMOCRATS, IT'S THE ONLY 

526
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:20,992
WAY THEY CAN WIN. 

527
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:29,200
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. 

528
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,137
TO THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE, LOOKING 

529
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,204
AT MOVIE SCREENS, WE LOVE YOU. 

530
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:37,075
YOU HAVE TO SEE THE LINES THAT 

531
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,110
GO ALL THE WAY BACK. 

532
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,443
MANY MILES. 

533
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:42,514
BUT, A LOT OF THEM SAY IT, 

534
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,815
THEY'RE WATCHING SCREENS, I 

535
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,952
LIKE YOUR LOCATION BETTER, DO 

536
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:47,485
YOU AGREE? 

537
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,554
BUT, THIS IS A SPECIAL GUY. 

538
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,489
AND, NORMALLY, I WOULDN'T MAKE 

539
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,357
A TRIP. 

540
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,657
BUT HERE, I HAD TWO REASONS. 

541
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:59,331
ONE WAS I LOVE THE STATE OF 

542
00:24:59,331 --> 00:24:59,598
KENTUCKY. 

543
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,835
AND THE OTHER WAS THAT ANDY 

544
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,537
BARR IS A GREAT CONGRESSMAN. 

545
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:29,094
ANDY, COME ON UP. 

546
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:32,964
>>  MR. PRESIDENT, WELCOME TO 

547
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:33,598
KENTUCKY'S SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL 

548
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:40,638
DISTRICT. 

549
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:41,873
HE SWING DISTRICT THAT  

550
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,707
YEARS AGO, YOU SENT A MESSAGE 

551
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,244
TO THE NATION BECAUSE YOU WON 

552
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,948
IT BY 15 POINTS. 

553
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:50,748
AND WELCOME TO MADISON COUNTY. 

554
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:53,184
A COUNTY  MR. PRESIDENT, THAT 

555
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:57,154
YOU WON BY A WHOPPING 32 

556
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,658
POINTS. 

557
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,794

577
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,971

578
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,873

AND SIX MONTHS LATER I WAS IN

588
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,188
AND WE WORKED TOGETHER. 

589
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,090
AND WE FUNDED THE MOST 

590
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,059
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO FIGHT 

591
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:47,732
A DRUG CRISIS IN AMERICAN 

592
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:48,066
HISTORY. 

593
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,902
THIS PRESIDENT IS A MAN OF 

594
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:51,135
ACTION. 

595
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:59,010
A MAN OF ACTION. 

596
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:04,815
OTHER PEOPLE RESIST. 

597
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:08,653
BUT, THIS PRESIDENT GETS 

598
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:08,920
RESULTS. 

599
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,789
AND SO, I WANT TO TURN IT OVER 

600
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:11,056
TO HIM. 

601
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,757
BUT I JUST WANT TO REMEMBER ONE 

602
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,393
SPECIAL NIGHT TWO YEARS AGO IN 

603
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:15,693
CLEVELAND. 

604
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,195
THE MOMENT I KNEW THIS MAN 

605
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:23,268
WOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF 

606
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,402
THE UNITED STATES. 

607
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:24,669
REMEMBER. 

608
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:25,436
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID. 

609
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:29,674
HE SAID THAT MY OPPONENT HAS A 

610
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:33,144
SLOGAN AND THAT SLOGAN IS I'M 

611
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,279
WITH HER. 

612
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:34,879
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID NEXT? 

613
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:39,050
WHAT HE SAID WAS I HAVE A 

614
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,450
DIFFERENT SLOGAN. 

615
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,553
AND THAT SLOGAN IS I'M WITH 

616
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:45,089
YOU. 

617
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:51,596
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

618
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,098
MR. PRESIDENT, I'M WITH YOU TO 

619
00:28:54,098 --> 00:29:03,708
FIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! 

620
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:09,113
>> THANK YOU. 

621
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:11,749
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 

622
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,886
NOW YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING 

623
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,254
THAT ANDY DIDN'T SAY IS THAT 

624
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:21,092
SHE PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR 

625
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,459
THAT SLOGAN. 

626
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,596
AND THE MORNING AFTER I CAME UP 

627
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:29,200
WITH MY LITTLE FEEL ON IT, THEY 

628
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,301
CHANGED THE SLOGAN. 

629
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:30,901
IT WAS GONE. 

630
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:31,268
IT WAS GONE. 

631
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:33,772
BUT, WE WEREN'T GONE BECAUSE 

632
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,674
THIS WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST 

633
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:41,179
MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF 

634
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:45,783
AMERICAN POLITICS. 

635
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:48,753
AND OUR SLOGAN WAS A GREAT 

636
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:49,120
SLOGAN. 

637
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,221
I THINK IT'S THE GREATEST 

638
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,022
SLOGAN THAT ANYBODY WILL EVER 

639
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:51,456
COME UP WITH. 

640
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,893
THOUGH IN TWO YEARS WE HAVE A 

641
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,160
NEW ONE. 

642
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,961
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. 

643
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:01,199
OURS IS MAKE AMERICA GREAT 

644
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:01,432
AGAIN. 

645
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,400
LOOK AT ALL THESE HATS. 

646
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,702
AND AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING, 

647
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,270
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FAST. 

648
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:11,376
IT'S CALLED KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 

649
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:19,017
THAT WILL BE IT. 

650
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,985
RIGHT? 

651
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,420
SO I'M HERE FOR ANDY BARR. 

652
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,656

STRONG BORDERS AND KENTUCKY 

654
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:26,590
VALUES. 

655
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,293
A VOTE FOR ANDY'S OPPONENT, I 

656
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:36,434
HAD TO DO A LITTLE CHECKING. 

657
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,434
WHO'S HE RUNNING AGAINST? 

658
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:38,236
WHO? 

659
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:44,575
THIS IS AN EXTREME LIBERAL 

660
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:49,279
NAMED AMY MCGRAFF. 

661
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,917
CHOSEN BY NANCY PELOSI. 

662
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,320
MAXINE WATERS. 

663
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,886
THAT'S A REAL BEAUTY. 

664
00:30:55,886 --> 00:31:00,224
AND, THE RADICAL DEMOCRAT MOB. 

665
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:05,229
NOW, AMY SUPPORTS A SOCIALIST 

666
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:06,965
TAKEOVER OF YOUR HEALTH CARE. 

667
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,132
WHICH BY THE WAY MEANS YOUR 

668
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:15,606
TAXES ARE GOING TO TRIPLE IF 

669
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:16,373
YOU'RE LUCKY. 

670
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:18,843
SHE SUPPORTS OPEN BORDERS. 

671
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,112
SHE NEEDS THE TAX HIKES TO 

672
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,179
COVER THE THROUGH THE ROOF 

673
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:27,919
GARBAGE THAT YOU WANT NO PART 

674
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,085
OF. 

675
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:32,390
AND SHE WANTS TO IMMEDIATELY 

676
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,024
DECIMATE YOUR NOW THRIVING COAL 

677
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,160
INDUSTRY. 

678
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,199
SO IF YOU WANT TO STOP NANCY 

679
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:46,170
PELOSI FROM BECOMING SPEAKER OF 

680
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:46,470
THE HOUSE. 

681
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,637
NO. 

682
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:47,705
WE CAN'T DO THAT. 

683
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:48,439
THAT WILL NOT BE GOOD. 

684
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,109
AND YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND 

685
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,177
VOTE FOR ANDY BARR. 

686
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,646
A GREAT MAN. 

687
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:57,148
GREAT LEADER. 

688
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,583
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I MUST TELL 

689
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:02,987
YOU, KENTUCKY, YOU'RE ALWAYS 

690
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,022
INVOLVED AT THE MIDDLE OF 

691
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:05,289
POLITICS. 

692
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:08,960
THE ELECTION OF ANDY IS A VERY 

693
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,360
IMPORTANT THING. 

694
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,629
COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 

695
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:12,897
BETWEEN UNBELIEVABLE CONTINUED 

696
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:13,731
SUCCESS AND FRANKLY, FAILURE 

697
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:17,101
WHERE WE FIGHT FOR TWO MORE 

698
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,536
YEARS WITH THESE PEOPLE. 

699
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:19,771
<u>ITH THESE OBSTRUCTI </u>

700
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,472
SO, IT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT 

701
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:21,672
RACE. 

702
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:23,540
IT COULD BE THE CONGRESSMAN. 

703
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,443
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 

704
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:25,643
THEM. 

705
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,778
THEY'RE SO FAR AHEAD IN THEIR 

706
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,011
RACES. 

707
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,013
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 

708
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:29,514
THEM ANY MORE. 

709
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:29,747
RIGHT? 

710
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,882
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 

711
00:32:31,882 --> 00:32:38,790
THEM. 

712
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,523
WE WERE TALKING BACKSTAGE AND 

713
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:40,658
THEY SAID IT. 

714
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,026
THIS COULD BE THE MOST 

715
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,127
IMPORTANT RACE THERE IS. 

716
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,863
SO GET OUT AND VOTE. 

717
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:49,333
WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. 

718
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,804
A MAJORITY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS 

719
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,238
HAVE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR 

720
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,174
SOCIALIST HEALTH CARE. 

721
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,643
BY THE WAY, IT DOESN'T WORK 

722
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,210
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 

723
00:32:59,210 --> 00:32:59,644
IT DOESN'T WORK. 

724
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,179
IT'S GOOD IF YOU DON'T MIND 

725
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,283
WAITING FIVE WEEKS TO SEE A 

726
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,484
DOCTOR. 

727
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,386
THEY COME FROM SOCIALIST 

728
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:08,719
COUNTRIES. 

729
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:12,056
FRANKLY, THEY COME FROM CANADA. 

730
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,058
BECAUSE, THEY WANT TO USE OUR 

731
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:14,325
DOCTORS. 

732
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,495
THEY COME FROM ALL OVER THE 

733
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:17,728
WORLD. 

734
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:19,597
AND WE'RE MAKING IT NOW, 

735
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:19,831
BETTER. 

736
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,132
AND THEY WANT TO DESTROY 

737
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,469
EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN BUILT. 

738
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,070
ALL OF THAT GREAT FOUNDATION. 

739
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,939
THEY WANT TO OUTLAW THE PRIVATE 

740
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,273
INSURANCE PLANS OF 2.4 MILLION 

741
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:32,977
KENTUCKY RESIDENTS AND SOME OF 

742
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,680
THOSE PLANS ARE FANTASTIC. 

743
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,214
AND INEXPENSIVE. 

744
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,382
THE DEMOCRAT PLAN WOULD 

745
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:42,720
OBLITERATE MEDICARE AND 

746
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,788
TERMINATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE 

747
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:44,555
FOR MERELY 250,000 KENTUCKY 

748
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:48,425
SENIORS WHO DEPEND ON IT. 

749
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:49,827
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT 

750
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:50,094
MEDICARE. 

751
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:50,828
AND WE WILL. 

752
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:56,167
FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS WHO HAVE 

753
00:33:56,167 --> 00:34:00,505
EARNED IT AND PAID FOR IT. 

754
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,473
AND REPUBLICANS ONLY WILL 

755
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:06,911
ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH 

756
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:07,612
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. 

757
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,112
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT IT. 

758
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:14,752
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 

759
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,420
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RADICAL 

760
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,022
SOCIALISM AND OPEN BORDERS. 

761
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,324
DEMOCRATS WANT TO ABOLISH ICE. 

762
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:24,061
AND THEY WANT TO TURN AMERICA 

763
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:32,170
INTO A GIANT SANCTUARY FOR 

764
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,471
CRIMINAL ALIENS AND MS-13 

765
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:33,704
THUGS. 

766
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,871
AND DON'T KID YOURSELF. 

767
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:36,774
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. 

768
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,277
AND THEY WANT TO GET RID OF 

769
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:40,478
ICE. 

770
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,078
THEY THINK ICE ISN'T NICE. 

771
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:43,880
DID YOU EVER SEE WHAT THEY'RE 

772
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,514
DEALING WITH? 

773
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:45,181
FIRST OF ALL, THEY'RE 

774
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:45,683
INCREDIBLE PATRIOTS. 

775
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,652
THEY HAVE A JOB THAT NOBODY IN 

776
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:52,857
THIS GROUP WANTS. 

777
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,293
THEY GO IN THERE AND THEY MEET 

778
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:56,893
THE MOST VILE, MOST VICIOUS 

779
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:58,729
PEOPLE AT WORK LIKE IT'S A DAY 

780
00:34:58,729 --> 00:34:59,096
AT THE OFFICE. 

781
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:00,798
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT. 

782
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:01,866
YEAH, YOU MIGHT DO IT. 

783
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,100
THIS GUY MIGHT DO IT. 

784
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,500
YOU WANT A JOB? 

785
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,835
I'LL GET IT TO YOU. 

786
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,137
LOOK AT THIS GUY. 

787
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:09,006
THIS GUY WILL DO IT. 

788
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:09,906
I'M LOOKING AT YOU. 

789
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:14,545
HE MIGHT DO IT. 

790
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,112
YOU MIGHT DO IT. 

791
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:19,851
BUT, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT. 

792
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,519
THEY GO IN THERE AND THEY 

793
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,186
LIBERATE TOWNS. 

794
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,855
THESE PEOPLE CAME IN BY THE 

795
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:25,155
THOUSANDS. 

796
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:29,227
AND, WE'RE TAKING THEM OUT BY 

797
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,228
THE THOUSANDS. 

798
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:33,230
THEY'RE GETTING OUT. 

799
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,167
THEY'RE GETTING OUT. 

800
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,602
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY 

801
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:43,741
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-

802
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,174
ABIDING AMERICANS. 

803
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:44,642
NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. 

804
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,745
AND, REPUBLICANS AND YOU KNOW 

805
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,813
THIS, YOU KNOW THIS. 

806
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,880
REPUBLICANS STAND PROUDLY WITH 

807
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,184
THE HEROS OF ICE AND BORDER 

808
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,419
PATROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

809
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,089
YOU KNOW THAT. 

810
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:04,595
ONE BY ONE, WE ARE FIGHTING THE 

811
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,798
ILLEGAL ALIEN PREDATORS, DRUG 

812
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,133
DEALERS, M S-13 KILLERS AND 

813
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,735
SENDING THEM BACK HOME. 

814
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,070
WE ARE LIBERATING AMERICA'S 

815
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,637
CITIES AND TOWNS. 

816
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:25,082
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 

817
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,183
THE ONLY IMMIGRATION POLICY 

818
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:29,086
DEMOCRATS SUPPORT IS CATCH AND 

819
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:29,352
RELEASE. 

820
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:30,755
YOU CATCH A CRIMINAL THUG, YOU 

821
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,690
TAKE THE NAME AND YOU RELEASE 

822
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:32,890
THEM. 

823
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,225
SAY PLEASE SHOW UP IN FIVE 

824
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,727
YEARS TO COURT. 

825
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,729
NOW, NUMBER ONE, IT'S 

826
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,032
RIDICULOUS, NUMBER TWO, THEY 

827
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,199
NEVER SHOW UP. 

828
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,067
WHAT A MESS. 

829
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,169
WE HAVE THE DUMBEST IMMIGRATION 

830
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,238
LAWS IN THE WORLD. 

831
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,739
THE WORLD LAUGHS AT US. 

832
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,308
BUT, WE'RE GETTING THEM 

833
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:50,575
CHANGED. 

834
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,343
WE NEED SOME MORE REPUBLICANS. 

835
00:36:53,343 --> 00:37:02,119
WE NEED SOME VOTES. 

836
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:09,026
IF YOU ELECT REPUBLICANS THIS 

837
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,428
NOVEMBER, WE WILL PASS 

838
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,195
LEGISLATION TO END CATCH AND 

839
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:11,595
RELEASE. 

840
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:17,201
HAVE YOU HEARD THE OTHER ONE? 

841
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:17,468
LOTTERY. 

842
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:22,506
LOTTERY. 

843
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:22,773
LOTTERY. 

844
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:22,973
OKAY? 

845
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:23,206
NAMES. 

846
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:25,109
COMING TO THE UNITED STATES. 

847
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,377
LET ME ASK YOU. 

848
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,411
THESE COUNTRIES SET UP 

849
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:27,744
LOTTERIES. 

850
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:30,915
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THEY'RE 

851
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,084
GIVING US THEIR FINEST? 

852
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,186
NO. 

853
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,487
THIS IS A LOTTERY. 

854
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,023
THIS WAS CHUCK SCHUMER'S 

855
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:54,839
SPECIAL DEAL FOR THIS COUNTRY. 

856
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,844
HOW CRAZY. 

857
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,078
THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY IN 

858
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,114
MANHATTAN WHERE I LIVE. 

859
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,116
WHERE I LOVE. 

860
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,584
RIGHT ALONG THE HUDSON RIVER. 

861
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,119
HE'S DRIVING A CAR DOWN THIS 

862
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,887
ROADWAY WHERE THE SPEED LIMIT 

863
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:10,654
IS 35. 

864
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:11,555
HE'S GOING ABOUT 70. 

865
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:16,894
AND, HE DECIDES TO MAKE A RIGHT 

866
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,562
TURN INTO A BEAUTIFUL PARK THAT 

867
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:23,634
GOES ALONG THE RIVER WITH LOTS 

868
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:23,934
OF PEOPLE. 

869
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,102
MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED. 

870
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,103
NOBODY EVERY TALKS ABOUT THE 

871
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:28,105
PEOPLE THAT WERE HORRIBLY 

872
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:28,606
INJURED. 

873
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,740
THEY LOST LEGS, THEY LOST ARMS. 

874
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,642
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE 

875
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,543
RUNNING. 

876
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:36,180
THEY WANT TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN 

877
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,413
SHAPE. 

878
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:37,948
THEY WERE WORKING OUT. 

879
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:45,122
THEY WERE WALKING HAND IN HAND 

880
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:45,389
TOGETHER. 

881
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,858
THEY'RE DEAD. 

882
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,226
THEY'RE HORRIBLY WOUNDED. 

883
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,395
MANY WILL NEVER EVER RECOVER. 

884
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,396
AND WHAT HAPPENS? 

885
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,733
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? 

886
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,303
IT WILL BE YEARS OF LITIGATION. 

887
00:38:59,303 --> 00:38:59,636
HE CAME IN. 

888
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:03,207
AND THEN HE TOOK CHAIN 

889
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:07,111
MIGRATION. 

890
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,748
AND HE BROUGHT HIS MOTHER, 

891
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:15,085
FATHER, BROTHER, SISTER, AUNT, 

892
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:15,719
AND GRANDFATHER. 

893
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,321
NONE OF THEM WORKED. 

894
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,323
IT ENDED UP BEING APPROXIMATELY 

895
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,726
22 PEOPLE CAME IN. 

896
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:27,031
IT'S CALLED A CHAIN. 

897
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,498
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL? 

898
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,432
A CHAIN. 

899
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,001
AND WE'RE STUCK WITH THEM. 

900
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,103
WE'RE STUCK WITH THESE PEOPLE. 

901
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:36,240
AND I DON'T WANT A CHAIN. 

902
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,176
I WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR 

903
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:45,215
COUNTRY ON A MERIT BASED 

904
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:46,250
SYSTEM. 

905
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,688
AND I WANT THEM TO HELP ALL OF 

906
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:57,127

THEY'RE MOVING TO MICHIGAN, 

910
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,202

THEY'RE MOVING TO NORTH AND 

912

THEY'RE COMING IN. 

914
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:11,141

AND YES, THEY'RE MOVING INTO 

916
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:21,251
KENTUCKY. 

917
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,254
AND WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE, WE 

918
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,457
HAVE BECOME SO SUCCESSFUL, WE 

919
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,259

BUT WE NEED GREAT PEOPLE WHO

AND THAT WANT TO WORK.

925
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:50,281
THIS IS ABOUT SAFETY AND 

926
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:50,581
POSTERITY. 

927
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:51,115
SINCE THE LAST ELECTION. 

928
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,752
THE FAKERS NEVER WOULD HAVE 

929
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:55,886
ALLOWED ME TO SAY. 

930
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,087
NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS HAVE I 

931
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:01,492
EVER SAID THIS DURING THE 

932
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:01,759
CAMPAIGN. 

933
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,861
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD HEADLINES. 

934
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:13,070
WE HAVE CREATED OVER 4.2 

935
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,104
MILLION NEW JOBS AND LIFTED 

936
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,174
OVER 4 MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF 

937
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:21,946
FOOD STAMPS. 

938
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,447
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? 

939
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,648
THE SECOND FOOD STAMPS, IT 

940
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:30,421
MEANS NUMBER ONE, WE GET RID OF 

941
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,057
AN UNBELIEVABLE COST, YOU 

942
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,793
WOWEDN'T BELIEVE IT. 

943
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:36,460
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. 

944
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,128
BUT YOU GET A LOT OF HAPPY 

945
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,229
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING. 

946
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:43,100
IT'S A GREAT THING. 

947
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,467
A GREAT THING. 

948
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:49,006
WE'VE ADDED NEARLY 600,000 

949
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,439
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

950
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:51,108
MANUFACTURING IS NEVER GOING TO 

951
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:51,608
COME BACK. 

952
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:55,612
NEVER GOING TO COME BACK. 

953
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:56,246
REMEMBER THE PREVIOUS 

954
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:57,581
ADMINISTRATION, YOU THINK 

955
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,681
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? 

956
00:41:58,681 --> 00:41:59,550
YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND. 

957
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:05,189
I GUESS WE HAD THE MAGIC WAND. 

958
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,690
WE HAD THE MAGIC WAND. 

959
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,892
AND THESE ARE GREAT JOBS. 

960
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:10,227
THESE ARE IMPORTANT JOBS. 

961
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:14,198
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

962
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,200
COMPANIES POURING BACK IN. 

963
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,567
MANUFACTURING. 

964
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,602
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 

965
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:25,109
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL 

966
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:30,814
EVER RECORDED IN HISTORY. 

967
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,983
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS 

968
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,985
REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 

969
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:39,723
HISTORY. 

970
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,893
HISPANIC AMERICAN, ASIAN 

971
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,129
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAS 

972
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:51,302
REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 

973
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:51,602
HISTORY. 

974
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,170
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STILL 

975
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:53,537
SAYING THIS. 

976
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,304
I AM SO SORRY. 

977
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:56,974
I APOLOGIZE TO THE WOMEN IN THE 

978
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:01,045
ROOM. 

979
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:01,979
REMEMBER I GOT 52%. 

980
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,482
THEY KEPT SAYING, THE FAKE 

981
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:05,682
NEWS. 

982
00:43:05,682 --> 00:43:06,617
THAT'S RIGHT. 

983
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,119
REMEMBER, HE SAID, THEY WERE 

984
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,422
ALL SAYING HE WILL NOT DO WELL 

985
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:11,889
WITH WOMEN. 

986
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:17,127
WOW DID WE DO WELL WITH WOMEN. 

987
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:21,331
DID WE DO WELL. 

988
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:21,598
HE WILL. 

989
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,634
FAKE NEWS. 

990
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:33,477
WE DID REALLY WELL WITH WOMEN. 

991
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:34,177
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE WOMEN'S 

992
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:37,147
UNEMPLOYMENT, MITCH, IS NOT AT 

993
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:37,580
A HISTORIC LOW. 

994
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:46,890
IT'S ONLY THE BEST NUMBER IN 65 

995
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,358
YEARS. 

996
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,795
WE LET DOWN WOMEN. 

997
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,197
WE LET DOWN WOMEN. 

998
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,098
65 YEARS, 3.6%. 

999
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,332
AS THE CHARTS GROW JUST A 

1000
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:59,002
LITTLE BIT, IT WILL BE HISTORIC 

1001
00:43:59,002 --> 00:43:59,470
VERY SOON. 

1002
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,704
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE 

1003
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:05,209
DEMOCRAT IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF 

1004
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:13,183
WINNING. 

1005
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,118
YOU KNOW ABOUT WINNING. 

1006
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,819
YOU REALLY KNOW ABOUT WINNING. 

1007
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,021
YOU PEOPLE ARE WINNING. 

1008
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:18,421
THOSE HORSES WIN. 

1009
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:20,790
I'M JUST AFRAID THAT KENTUCKY 

1010
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:25,229
IS WINNING TOO MUCH. 

1011
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,263
YOU'RE GOING TO SEND MATT TO 

1012
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,866
SEE RAND PAUL AND MITCH 

1013
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,166
MCCONNELL. 

1014
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,302
AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO COME 

1015
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,037
TO THE OVAL ALWAYS TO SEE ME 

1016
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:36,140
AND SAY  MR. PRESIDENT, WE 

1017
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,007
CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE. 

1018
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,508
KENTUCKY IS WINNING TOO MUCH. 

1019
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:40,109
THEY CAN'T DO IT. 

1020
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:40,610
THEY DON'T LIKE IT. 

1021
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:47,918
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT 

1022
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:48,184
ANYMORE. 

1023
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:49,653
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WE'RE 

1024
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,955
WINNING SO MUCH, WE JUST CAN'T 

1025
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:52,623
STAND IT. 

1026
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,792
I'M GOING TO SAY MITCH, AND 

1027
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,827
MATT, AND RAND, I'M SORRY. 

1028
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:57,427
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WINNING. 

1029
00:44:57,427 --> 00:44:58,996
WE'RE GOING TO WIN MORE. 

1030
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,531
AND MORE, AND MORE, AND MORE. 

1031
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,466
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WINNING. 

1032
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,199
I'M SORRY FOLKS. 

1033
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:10,274
AND I WILL SEND THEM HAPPILY 

1034
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:14,311
BACK TO KENTUCKY. 

1035
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:14,844
YOU'RE WINNING A LOT. 

1036
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:15,278
WE WON TODAY. 

1037
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:22,820
WE WON TODAY WITH A GREAT 

1038
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,053
PASTOR. 

1039
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:23,420
PASTOR BRUNSON. 

1040
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,056
LAST WEEK, I ANNOUNCED WE ARE 

1041
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,123
REPLACING THE HORROR SHOW. 

1042
00:45:27,123 --> 00:45:32,262
ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER 

1043
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:36,600
MADE KNOWN AS NAFTA WITH AN 

1044
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,171
INCREDIBLE BRAND NEW U.S. 

1045
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,874
MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT CALLED 

1046
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:45,174
THE USMCA. 

1047
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:46,176
AND, EVEN THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

1048
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:49,079
SAYING WOW, WHAT A GREAT DEAL 

1049
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:49,512
THAT IS. 

1050
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:51,114
WE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 

1051
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:52,616
WE MAY ACTUALLY GET BIPARTISAN 

1052
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:52,883
SUPPORT. 

1053
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,384
THOUGH IF IT'S TOO GOOD. 

1054
00:45:54,384 --> 00:46:00,591
THEY WON'T SUPPORT IT. 

1055
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,257
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. 

1056
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:01,424
NO. 

1057
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:02,025
I WILL SAY. 

1058
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,160
EVEN CHUCK SCHUMER LIKED IT. 

1059
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:09,232
HE SAID THAT'S A GOOD DEAL. 

1060
00:46:09,232 --> 00:46:13,070
WE'VE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST EVER 

1061
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,938
ACTION ON CHINA'S ABUSIVE TRADE 

1062
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:15,238
PRACTICES. 

1063
00:46:15,238 --> 00:46:22,613
CHINA, AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT 

1064
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:22,946
FOR CHINA. 

1065
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:23,380
WE ALL DO. 

1066
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,215
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THEIR 

1067
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:25,515
PRESIDENT. 

1068
00:46:25,515 --> 00:46:32,356
THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE HEAD OF 

1069
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:32,990
CHINA. 

1070
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,423
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1071
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,558
THEY'VEBEEN MAKING 300 BILLION 

1072
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,360
TO $500 BILLION A YEAR TAKING 

1073
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,162
IT OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1074
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:42,599
WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. 

1075
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,035
AND I DON'T BLAME CHINA. 

1076
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:45,969
I BLAME OUR PAST LEADERS 

1077
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,271
BECAUSE THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE 

1078
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,374
LET IT HAPPEN. 

1079
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,209
I DON'T BLAME CHINA. 

1080
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:57,681
AND THANKS TO OUR STRONG TRADE, 

1081
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,049

INDUSTRIES BROKE GROUND ON A 

1083
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,120
NEW BILLION DOLLAR ALUMINUM 

1084
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:09,159
MILL THAT WILL CREATE UP TO 

1085
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:13,196
1,500 JOBS RIGHT NEXT TO 

1086
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:15,165
ASHLAND, KENTUCKY. 

1087
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,967
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING 

1088
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:18,201
ABOUT? 

1089
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:18,468
ASHLAND. 

1090
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,469
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, WE 

1091
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,238
ALSO PASS THE BIGGEST PACKAGE 

1092
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:29,179
OF TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORMS. 

1093
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,847
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1094
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,182
WE HAVE TAKEN HISTORIC ACTION 

1095
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:39,056
TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF 

1096
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:39,489
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. 

1097
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:44,895
YOU SAW THREE WEEKS AGO, A LOT 

1098
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,065
OF DRUG COMPANIES ANNOUNCED A 

1099
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,099
VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE. 

1100
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:56,139
I SAID TO SECRETARY ALEX 

1101
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,274
AUGUSTA, THIS IS NO GOOD. 

1102
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:57,808
THIS IS NO GOOD. 

1103
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,543
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING, I WANT 

1104
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,777
TO CALL THEM. 

1105
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:01,844
AND I CALLED THE HEAD OF FIZER. 

1106
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:05,782
BIG COMPANY, I GUESS LIKE THE 

1107
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:06,049
BIGGEST. 

1108
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,684
BIG, BIG DRUG COMPANY. 

1109
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,854
I CALLED THE HEADS OF THESE 

1110
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:11,154
COMPANIES. 

1111
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,556
I SAID SIR, SIR, WE WILL 

1112
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,257
IMMEDIATELY DROP THE PRICE BACK 

1113
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:15,392
TO WHERE IT WAS. 

1114
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,893
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THAT? 

1115
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,528
AND RAND PAUL, IT'S THE FIRST 

1116
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,931
TIME I REALIZED HOW POWERFUL IT 

1117
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:25,202
WAS TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

1118
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,537
UNITED STATES. 

1119
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:28,906
NO, THEY REDUCED ...  

1120
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,440
AND BY THE WAY, I KID. 

1121
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:30,740
BUT, I DO. 

1122
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,176
I RESPECT THAT THEY DID THAT. 

1123
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,478
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 

1124
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,780
AND NOW, BECAUSE OF WHAT 

1125
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,450
SECRETARY AZAR IS DOING, YOU'RE 

1126
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:45,122
GOING TO SEE DRUG PRICING, 

1127
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,357
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS GOING DOWN. 

1128
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:52,429
WE HAVE COUNTRIES, THE EXACT 

1129
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,830
SAME PILL, THE EXACT SAME 

1130
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,832
PRESCRIPTION MADE IN THE EXACT 

1131
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,434
SAME FACTORY OR PLANT IN 

1132
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:57,667
CANADA. 

1133
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:05,308
AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES ALL OVER 

1134
00:49:05,308 --> 00:49:06,276
THE WORLD. 

1135
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,711
IS MUCH LESS. 

1136
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:12,749
SOMETIMES 50%, SOMETIMES MUCH 

1137
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:12,949
LESS. 

1138
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:13,483
THAN WHAT AMERICANS PAY. 

1139
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:13,950
WE'RE DOING A NUMBER. 

1140
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,118
I'M GOING TO BE HATED SO MUCH 

1141
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,655
BY SOME PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 

1142
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:19,488
THAT MADE A FORTUNE. 

1143
00:49:19,488 --> 00:49:21,224
BUT, WE'RE GETTING DRUG PRICES 

1144
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,159
WAY DOWN. 

1145
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,195
AND WE STARTED IT LAST FRIDAY. 

1146
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:29,265
WITH THE SIGNING OF TWO BILLS. 

1147
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:30,300
AND SOMETHING THAT THE 

1148
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,435
CONGRESSMAN REALLY HELPED ME 

1149
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:31,635
WITH. 

1150
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:37,340
ALL OF THEM IN THE ROOM. 

1151
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,509
AND ANDY. 

1152
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,878
IN PARTICULAR, WE HELP, RIGHT 

1153
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,081
NOW, GET CRITICALLY ILL, 

1154
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:48,251
TERMINAL PATIENTS, ACCESS TO 

1155
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:48,985
LIFE SAVING TREATMENTS. 

1156
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:52,956
WE JUST PASSED RIGHT TO TRY. 

1157
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:57,527
RIGHT TO TRY. 

1158
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,130
I HOPE NOBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS 

1159
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:00,864
TO USE IT. 

1160
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,066
BUT THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS 

1161
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:03,433
TERMINALLY ILL. 

1162
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,434
WE HAVE THE GREATEST DRUG 

1163
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:05,836
COMPANIES AND THE GREATEST 

1164
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,537
RESEARCH IN THE WORLD BY FAR. 

1165
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:08,005
NOBODY CLOSE. 

1166
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,107
BUT WE HAVE A PIPELINE. 

1167
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:18,715
IT WOULD TAKE 12 TO 15 YEARS TO 

1168
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:19,216
GET IT APPROVED. 

1169
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:19,949
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. 

1170
00:50:19,949 --> 00:50:26,690
BUT IF WE HAD SOMETHING THAT 

1171
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,591
REALLY SHOWED GREAT PROMISE, 

1172
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:30,360
TOWARD A PROBLEM THAT SOMEBODY 

1173
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:30,994
HAD WHO IS TERMINALLY ILL. 

1174
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,497
44 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO 

1175
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,731
GET THIS PASSED. 

1176
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:35,098
THEY COULDN'T. 

1177
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,066
NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS. 

1178
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,100
BETWEEN THE INSURANCE 

1179
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,768
COMPANIES, THE LIABILITIES, THE 

1180
00:50:38,768 --> 00:50:39,135
COUNTRY ITSELF. 

1181
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:41,071
THE LAWSUITS. 

1182
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:46,910
SO I GOT EVERYBODY IN A ROOM. 

1183
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:47,577
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF. 

1184
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,378
HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW FRIENDS? 

1185
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:50,680
IF THEY HAVE MONEY, THEY TRAVEL 

1186
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,817
ALL OVER THE WORLD BEGGING AND 

1187
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,919
LOOKING FOR A CURE. 

1188
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:56,520
THEY WANT HOPE. 

1189
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,022
IF THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY, THEY 

1190
00:50:59,022 --> 00:50:59,289
GO HOME. 

1191
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,323
THEY HAVE NO HOPE. 

1192
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:08,632
AND WE HAVE RIGHT TO TRY 

1193
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:08,999
PASSED. 

1194
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,267
A MONTH-AND-A-HALF AGO. 

1195
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:17,207
ALREADY IT'S HAD AN INCREDIBLE 

1196
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:17,440
IMPACT. 

1197
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:17,874
INCREDIBLE IMPACT. 

1198
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,108
44 YEARS. 

1199
00:51:19,108 --> 00:51:22,712
SO NOW A PATIENT IS TERMINALLY 

1200
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:25,015
ILL. 

1201
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,115
WE MAKE THEM SIGN A DOCUMENT. 

1202
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:27,049
VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENT. 

1203
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:28,451
AND WE GO IN AND WE WORK WITH 

1204
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:30,987
THEM AND WE SEE IF WE CAN HELP 

1205
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:31,354
THEM. 

1206
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,789
AND WE HAVE HAD SOME INCREDIBLE 

1207
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,189
RESULTS ALREADY. 

1208
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:36,426
SO, I JUST WANT TO THANK ANDY 

1209
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:46,403
BARR AND ALL OF THE CONGRESSMEN 

1210
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:47,337
HERE. 

1211
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,172
AND MITCH AND RAND BECAUSE WE 

1212
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,273
GOT IT PASSED. 

1213
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,708
WE GOT IT PASSED. 

1214
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,076
MANY, MANY YEARS THEY WORKED ON 

1215
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:53,242
IT. 

1216
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:55,278
THEY COULDN'T GET IT DONE. 

1217
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,513
WE ALSO PASSED VETERAN'S 

1218
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:56,746
CHOICE. 

1219
00:51:56,746 --> 00:52:00,984
GIVING OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT 

1220
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:07,123
TO SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR INSTEAD 

1221
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,858
OF WAITING ONLINE. 

1222
00:52:08,858 --> 00:52:11,628
FOR 12 DAYS, 24 DAYS, 38 DAYS. 

1223
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,194
WE HAVE OUR VETERANS. 

1224
00:52:12,194 --> 00:52:14,030
WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH 

1225
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:14,363
THE VETERANS. 

1226
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:15,765
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST 

1227
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:16,165
IMPORTANT THINGS. 

1228
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:17,200
BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE WAITING 

1229
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,104
IN LINE FOR SOMETIMES MONTHS IF 

1230
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:21,972
YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. 

1231
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,473
WE HAD PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE 

1232
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,909
AND THEY WEREN'T VERY SICK. 

1233
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:33,149
BY THE TIME THEY SAW A DOCTOR 

1234
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,217
THEY WERE TERMINALLY ILL. 

1235
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:34,984
NOW, IF THERE'S A WAY. 

1236
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:36,686
BECAUSE WE HAVE GREAT DOCTORS 

1237
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:37,187
IN THE VA. 

1238
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:42,292
THAT'S ONE THING EVERYBODY 

1239
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:42,559
TELLS ME. 

1240
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,193
CAN'T GET TO THEM. 

1241
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,262
NOW, IF THERE'S A WAIT, YOU GO 

1242
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:45,729
TO A LOCAL DOCTOR. 

1243
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:49,199
YOU GET YOURSELF TAKEN CARE OF 

1244
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:56,706
AND WE PAY FOR THE BILL. 

1245
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,008
THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE. 

1246
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:58,808
THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE. 

1247
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,210
TOOK OVER 40 YEARS. 

1248
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,645
I USED TO SAY TO PEOPLE WHY 

1249
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,445
DON'T WE DO THAT? 

1250
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,145
I SAID LISTEN. 

1251
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:07,017
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA. 

1252
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:07,584
THESE LINES ARE TERRIBLE. 

1253
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,117
28 DAY, 30 DAYS. 

1254
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:09,919
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA. 

1255
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:11,621
THE GREATEST IDEA I THINK I 

1256
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:11,988
HAVE EVER HAD. 

1257
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:15,025
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM GO TO 

1258
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,993
A PRIVATE DOCTOR INSTEAD OF 

1259
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:17,393
WAITING IN LINE. 

1260
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:18,995
WE ARE TRYING TO GET THAT 

1261
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,497
PASSED 40 YEARS. 

1262
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,032
YOU HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE. 

1263
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,967
THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED BUT 

1264
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,304
WE'RE GOOD AT GETTING THINGS 

1265
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:27,737
PASSED. 

1266
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,906
WE GOT IT PASSED. 

1267
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,040
RAND AND MITCH AND ANDY. 

1268
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,445
WE GOT IT PASSED AND THE 

1269
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,247
LANDMARK VA ACCOUNTABILITY LAW 

1270
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:38,982
TO ENSURE ANYONE WHO MISTREATS 

1271
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:42,385
OUR VETERANS WILL BE HELD 

1272
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:42,919
ACCOUNTABLE. 

1273
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,019
JIM, YOU MISTREATED OUR 

1274
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,156
VETERAN, JIM. 

1275
00:53:46,156 --> 00:54:01,171
JIM, YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT. 

1276
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,941
WE JUST SECURED $700 BILLION 

1277
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:05,408
AND $716 BILLION. 

1278
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:09,145
TWO YEARS, TO FULLY REBUILD THE 

1279
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:17,187
AMERICAN MILITARY. 

1280
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,688
BIGGER, STRONGER, MORE POWERFUL 

1281
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:20,156
THAN EVER BEFORE. 

1282
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:20,957
WE ARE GIVING WARRIORS THEIR 

1283
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:25,228
LARGEST PAY RAISE IN OVER A 

1284
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,663
DECADE. 

1285
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,298
AND AT MY DIRECTION AND WE NEED 

1286
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:33,135
RAND AND WE NEED  MITCH'S HELP. 

1287
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:38,007
LET THEM KNOW HOW POPULAR IT 

1288
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:39,142
IS. 

1289
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,811
IT'S ALL ABOUT SPACE. 

1290
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:42,278
ALL ABOUT SPACE. 

1291
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:44,680
EVERYTHING WILL SOON BE ALL 

1292
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,047
ABOUT SPACE. 

1293
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:47,216
SO LET RAND AND MITCH KNOW 

1294
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:47,516
ABOUT THIS. 

1295
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:49,819
AT MY DIRECTION. 

1296
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:53,089
THE PENTAGON IS NOW WORKING TO 

1297
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,824
CREATE THE SIXTH BRANCH OF THE 

1298
00:54:54,824 --> 00:55:01,197
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES KNOWN AS 

1299
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:04,667
THE SPACE FORCE. 

1300
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,202
NOW THEY HAVE TO DO IT. 

1301
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,938
I PUT THEM ON THE SPOT. 

1302
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,274
I PUT THEM ON THE SPOT. 

1303
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:16,579
NOW THEY HAVE TO DO IT. 

1304
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:17,379
IT'S VERY POPULAR. 

1305
00:55:17,379 --> 00:55:18,615
ONE OF THE BIGGEST APPLAUSES I 

1306
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:22,152
GET IS WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE 

1307
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,052
SPACE FORCE. 

1308
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:23,986
CHINA AND RUSSIA HAVE ALREADY 

1309
00:55:23,986 --> 00:55:24,253
STARTED. 

1310
00:55:24,253 --> 00:55:25,221
THEY HAVE STARTED BUT WE HAVE 

1311
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,190
THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE 

1312
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,192
WORLD. 

1313
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,828
WE MAKE THE GREATEST EQUIPMENT 

1314
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,428
IN THE WORLD. 

1315
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:35,064
WE MAKE THE GREATEST ROCKETS 

1316
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:37,333
AND MISSILES AND TANKS AND 

1317
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:41,237
SHIPS IN THE WORLD. 

1318
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:44,974
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 

1319
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:51,147
FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE-SIDED 

1320
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,715
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 

1321
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:54,050
AND WHEN I CAME TO OFFICE, 

1322
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,019
WEEKS BEFORE I WAS GIVEN RUN 

1323
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:56,920
DOWNS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND 

1324
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,455
IRAN IS JUST A QUESTION OF WHEN 

1325
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,690
WILL THEY TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE 

1326
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,023
MIDDLE EAST. 

1327
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:05,361
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT 

1328
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:05,728
ANYMORE FOLKS. 

1329
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:07,130
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT 

1330
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:07,530
ANYMORE. 

1331
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,865
THEY HAVE A LITTLE DISASTER 

1332
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,165
GOING. 

1333
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:14,737
THEY HAVE RIOTS IN THE STREET. 

1334
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:15,271
THEIR CURRENCY IS SHOT. 

1335
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,372
THEY'LL BE COMING TO US SOME 

1336
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,708
DAY PROBABLY NOT TOO FAR OUT 

1337
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,977
AND SAY WE'D LIKE TO MAKE A 

1338
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:21,544
DEAL AND THAT'S FINE. 

1339
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:21,877
THAT'S GOOD. 

1340
00:56:21,877 --> 00:56:24,614
BUT A REAL DEAL. 

1341
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:28,017
NOT THE JOKE OF THE DEAL MADE 

1342
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,285
BY THE PAST ADMINISTRATION. 

1343
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:31,955
AN WE RECOGNIZED THE CAPITAL OF 

1344
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:32,188
ISRAEL. 

1345
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:37,460
AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY 

1346
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:43,599
IN JERUSALEM. 

1347
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:55,979
RIGHT?

1348
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,981
TOGETHER WE HAVE MADE 

1349
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:58,481
EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS. 

1350
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,749
BUT, WE'RE JUST GETTING 

1351
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,016
STARTED. 

1352
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:03,219
IF YOU VOTE TO ELECT REPUBLICAN 

1353
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:03,987
HOUSE AND REPUBLICAN SENATE, WE 

1354
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,857
WILL CONTINUE TO CUT YOUR 

1355
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:08,090
TAXES. 

1356
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,492
CUT YOUR REGULATIONS. 

1357
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:18,001
AND, RAISE YOUR INCOMES VERY, 

1358
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:18,434
VERY SUBSTANTIALLY. 

1359
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:21,170
WE, UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATS, WILL 

1360
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,572
PROTECT MEDICARE AND PROTECT 

1361
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,473
SOCIAL SECURITY. 

1362
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:26,743
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID DURING THE 

1363
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:27,010
DEBATES? 

1364
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,443
WE WILL PROTECT IT. 

1365
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:30,980
WE WILL DEFEND YOUR SECOND 

1366
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,447
AMENDMENT. 

1367
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:38,421
AND PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO FREE 

1368
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:43,659
SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. 

1369
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:47,397
WITH YOUR HELP, MITCH 

1370
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,831
MCCONNELL, RAND PAUL, AND ALL 

1371
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:51,067
OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK SO WELL 

1372
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,869
WITH US WILL CONTINUE TO 

1373
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:56,072
CONFIRM INCREDIBLE PRO 

1374
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:56,806
CONSTITUTION JUDGES. 

1375
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,143
NOT RADICAL FAR LEFT JUDGES WHO 

1376
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,413
WILL REWRITE YOUR CONSTITUTION 

1377
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,982
AND REPLACE YOUR KENTUCKY 

1378
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:06,349
VALUES. 

1379
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:07,016
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 

1380
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:07,349
84 JUDGES. 

1381
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:08,585
THINK OF THAT. 

1382
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:08,985
THAT'S A RECORD. 

1383
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:09,385
THAT'S A RECORD. 

1384
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:13,623
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT TO 

1385
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:13,789
GO. 

1386
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:14,056
A RECORD. 

1387
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:14,791
84 JUDGES APPROVED. 

1388
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,224
WHAT A DIFFERENCE. 

1389
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:18,728
GOING TO BE BY THE TIME WE 

1390
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:21,097
FINISH, MAYBE 50% OF THE COURT. 

1391
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,331
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? 

1392
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:23,399
MAYBE 50%. 

1393
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:26,603
WE'LL FULLY SECURE THE BORDER. 

1394
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:29,639
WE'LL PASS KATE'S LAW. 

1395
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,439
STOP SANCTUARY CITIES. 

1396
00:58:30,439 --> 00:58:32,308
END THE VISA LOTTERY AN CHAIN 

1397
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:32,976
MIGRATION. 

1398
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:37,246
AND WE WILL KEEP THE CRIMINALS, 

1399
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:42,852
DRUG DEALERS AND TERRORISTS OUT 

1400
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:52,195
OF OUR COUNTRY.

1401
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:56,366
WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF 

1402
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,636
OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO 

1403
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,137
WORK. 

1404
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,939
FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. 

1405
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,540
BUT, TO ACHIEVE THIS FUTURE, TO 

1406
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,276

1407
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:09,245

00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:17,654
AND MAYBE OF ANY COUNTRY, YOU 

1409
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:18,654
NEED TO VOTE REPUBLICAN.

GREAT MAN. 

1426
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:18,281
A VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN 

1427
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,150
CONGRESS IS A VOTE FOR MORE 

1428
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,719
JOBS, MORE WEALTH, AND MORE 

1429
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:29,025
PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE 

1430
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:29,392
GOOD OLD USA.

01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:34,163
IT'S A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR 

1432
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:34,363

1435
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,138
THEY ARE HEROS. 

1436
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,640
AN A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 

1437
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,745
VOTE TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT 

1438
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,781
POLITICS OF HATRED, ANGER AND 

1439
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,015
DIVISION. 

1440
01:00:53,015 --> 01:00:55,952
AND TO CELEBRATE THE GREATNESS 

1441
01:00:55,952 --> 01:01:01,324
AND THE GLORY OF BEING AN 

1442
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,391
AMERICAN. 

1443
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:06,663
IT IS NOT UP TO THE MEDIA. 

1444
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,065
IT'S NOT UP TO THE PENDANTS. 

1445
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:16,539
IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE YOUR 

1446
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:16,839
OWN FAITH. 

1447
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:23,146
YOU HAVE THE POWER WITH YOUR

01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,847
VOTE TO DEFEND YOUR FAMILY.

01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:30,219
DEPEND YOUR VALUES, YOUR FAITH, 

1450
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:30,887

1451
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,855
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP 

1452
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,956
BUILD THIS COUNTRY. 

1453
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:38,227
AND TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING 

1454
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,429

1455
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:51,140
RETURNING POWER TO THE AMERICAN 

1456
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,241
PEOPLE.

1457
01:01:52,241 --> 01:02:00,149
THIS GREAT STATE WAS SETTLED BY 

1458
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:00,817
REALLY, HOW TOUGH? 

1459
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:01,117
HOW SMART? 

1460
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:05,521
BY TOUGH, TOUGH MEN AND EVEN 

1461
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,224
TOUGHER WOMEN, BY THE WAY. 

1462
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,960
BUT IT WAS SETTLED BY TOUGH 

1463
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,029
MEN, PIONEER WOMEN WHO BRAVED 

1464
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:13,663
THE WILDERNESS AND DEFIED THE 

1465
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,264
DANGERS TO BUILD A LIFE AND A 

1466
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,199
HOME. 

1467
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,267
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 

1468
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,802
MONEY. 

1469
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:23,306
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 

1470
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:23,539
LUXURY. 

1471
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:26,642
