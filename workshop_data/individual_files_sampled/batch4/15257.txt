so what you're looking at here is just as 2008 you're looking at people who work and pay taxes that's everyone between ages 15 and 64 years old who paid some employment income in a given year and the blue lines that's what these represent and you can see if it's on the right hand side that means there was growth in a in employment if it's on the left hand side that means it's shrinking and it is shrinking in all of Central and Eastern Canada the actual number of employed people has gone down down a lot percentage-wise in Newfoundland I already showed you that Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are in next next in line for the amount of lost jobs but those are small provinces right there they're less than a million people live in each of them so if you have a six or seven percent decline that that's very bad for that province but it's not a huge number for the whole country but look at the lines for Ontario and Quebec the down about a percent or half a percent but they're down over nearly a ten-year period so let me translate now into very plain English I hope you're still watching according to this chart which is a Statistics Canada chart the average paid employment growth in Ontario and Quebec is negative from 2008 to 2015 it has gone down the number of people working has shrunk no none of it than the Northern Territory it's booming for jobs it's up 12 percent or so that's the biggest grower but again Nunavut is so tiny the fact that it grew twelve percent that doesn't really mean that much same thing with the Yukon great place I'm just saying it's only a few tens of thousands of people up there so the fact that they had strong employment growth it's not significant nationally that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
