well cz is a shorthand for cubic
zirconium
zircon is an element that can be
artificially produced in a lab so it's
what we call a diamond simulant some of
the differences that are right away very
obvious would be that for the same size
and proportions a cz weighs
approximately twice as much and so
you'll see a lot of diamond dealers
shaking their hands up and down seeing
what the weight is I'm not a diamond the
fire of a round brilliant cut is what we
call moderate cz has much more of that
because the cutters know this when they
cut CZs they cut them with bigger facets
so it reduces the fire so there are
several quick ways that a jeweller or
someone who can have access to this
information distinguish cz from a
diamond
