a grim development in the poisoning case in the UK town of Amesbury one of the victims has died she had allegedly been exposed to the nerve agent Norfolk chalk let's get details on this now and cross live to artis Anastasio truck owner who's joining us on the program now or can you bring us up to speed on on the developments what's the latest that you know well Rory indeed one of the two people that were taken to hospital last weekend from Amesbury which is just miles away from Salisbury where Sergey and Yulia scruple were said to have been poisoned by Nava choc back in March has indeed been pronounced dead we do know that 44 year old John Sturges died on Sunday night and we know that the British prime minister has expressed that she's appalled and shocked by this development indeed the partner of this woman who was also taken to hospital remains in critical condition and Scotland Yard have now announced they will be treating this as a murder investigation and despite the fact that this lead a separate incident from the one following the one with Sergey and Yulia scorp all is indeed being in its early stages of investigation we do know that some officials giving the whole mood about these incidents have still been pointing fingers at Russia already somebody is responsible for it and at the end of the day the buck stops with the Kremlin we cannot allow individuals anywhere in this country to be assassinated well some of the newspapers here in the UK have indeed already followed suit I can show you just some of this morning here we have knowledge shock mom dead and what what she's been poisoned with is described as a Russian nerve agent despite the fact that of course throughout the last several months we have heard that other countries have come forward in terms of being able to have produced this nerve agent here we have Russian poison Britt dies this one over here murdered by Nava shock and here of course murder hunt as nerve agent victim dies and surely given how much attention has been given to the original Sergei trepal poisoning which of course we have to keep in mind that himself and his daughter Yulia are now fine and well and have now for quite some time left the hospital it is it's that given the moods with the original poisoning despite the fact that an investigation is now only trying to figure out how it is exactly possible that months after the original poisoning this couple was also pronounced to have fallen ill from Nava Chuck we do know that given the moods by politician here in the UK in terms of the attitudes of blaming Russia for this despite Russia saying it has nothing to do with it is likely to stick around especially with just last week before this woman unfortunately passed away we heard the Home Secretary talked about how Russia needs to come clean in this case it is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on it is the actions of the Russian government that this that continue to undermine our security well again of course this is a story now that has taken a much more tragic turn of events so far UK officials had announced that four people had fallen sick from this nerve agent on their soil we now know of course that one person has died and which means this investigation is going to be even more vigorous and hopefully will be shedding light on who exactly was behind these incidents - t's honest ith o'connor thank you we spoke with former US diplomat Jim Jat rest's he says that claims made by the British authorities and the media they just don't quite add up evidently and as I say if the the two scruples were poisoned with some agent which the British authorities say is an avi Chuck which is a highly deadly nerve agent why why did they recover but these people who were exposed weeks after the fact didn't it was simply a residue left over after presumably the area had been scrubbed I I think the first thing I would do if I were a British citizen is demanded their government come clean tell what they actually know we don't really expect anything from the British media where the British media is even worse than the American media as being total lapdogs of whatever it is their government says you
