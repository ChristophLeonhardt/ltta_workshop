well multi multiple reports indicate that President Trump and Trump family members and Trump team members are more worried about what is happening in judge Kimbell woods courtroom in the daniel patrick moynihan courthouse in manhattan then anything that is happening in robert Weller's grand jury investigation in Washington DC judge Kimbell woods courtroom is where the president is fighting to suppress evidence obtained in FBI FBI raids of his former lawyer Michael Cohen's home and office in hotel room and safety deposit box according to the Associated Press Trump and his allies have hit a new level of anxiety after the raid on his personal Attorney's Office fearful of deeper exposure for Trump his inner circle and his adult children and more than concerned that they don't know exactly what is in those records and electronic devices seized last week a former Trump campaign official told Axios the guys that know Trump best are most worried people are very very worried because it's Michael effing Cohen who knows what he's done the clearest indication of just how worried Donald Trump is about this federal criminal case in the Southern District of New York appears on the second page of the transcript of yesterday's hearing it lists the lawyers presence and there you see Spears and iams LLP attorneys for Donald J Trump president the lead counsel for Spears and imes on this case is Joanna C Hendon she spoke for the president in court below that you see an attorney for the Trump Organization and also an attorney representing the New York Times and other news organizations who successfully argued for the release of Sean Hannity's name in court yesterday and at the bottom of the page is Michael avenatti attorney for interested party Stephanie Clifford also known as stormy Daniels and so the President of the United States once again has the honor of being the very first president in history to have his name appear in legal legal filings with a porn star and you'll remember that Michael avenatti went from the courtroom yesterday to right here at the last word last night where he described for us drama and legal incompetence of Michael Cohen's lawyers that led to Sean Hannity's name being revealed in court as one of Michael Cohen's three and only three law clients but Michael avenatti had no criticism last night for president Trump's lawyers the law firm of Spears and iams the Spears an x team is the best legal hire that Donald Trump has made in his life Donald Trump is in trouble in federal court in the Southern District of New York largely because he has been unwilling to pay top dollar for top lawyers throughout his life Donald Trump is cheap that's why Michael Cohen is in his life and that's why Michael Cohen may have ruined Donald Trump's life Donald Trump has been represented by a varying cast of lawyers in the Robert Moeller investigation none of them top-tier lawyers but Donald Trump's not fooling around in the Southern District of New York oh no Donald Trump hired the best criminal defense lawyers he could find Spears and iams is a law firm founded by two former assistant US attorneys in the Southern District of New York you cannot get better criminal defense lawyers than the spears and iams team that's the good news for Donald Trump the other good news is that he won't pay for it Donald Trump will continue to use campaign contributions to pay for his lawyers he has spent almost $100,000 already for his lawyer in the stormy Daniels civil lawsuit brought by Michael avenatti in a California Court so Donald Trump is getting the best criminal lawyers he can get in New York City and he's making his campaign contributors pay for it but here's the news about his new criminal defense law firm that Donald Trump does not know and that is going to drive him crazy than he has already been driven by what's happening in judge woods courtroom the president has been ranting repeatedly about what he believes are the political leanings of Robert Muller's team of prosecutors here's a recent example the fake and corrupt Russia investigation headed up by all Democrat lists the president's lead defense lawyer in court yesterday from the firm of Spears and iams was Johanna Hendon she was an assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York hired by the first woman US attorney in the Southern District of New York Mary Jo white who was selected for the job by Liberal Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and officially nominated by President Bill Clinton if Johanna Hendon were on Robert Muller's team Donald Trump would be calling her a Democrat loyalist instead of paying her to defend him tonight which is what he's doing but that's not the best part the most maddening thing for Donald Trump about the law firm he has hired Spears and iams the founders of that law firm Spears and iams David Spears and Linda Ives were assistant US attorneys serving with assistant US attorney James B Comey Spears and Iams and Comey all worked in the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York the same unit that Donald Trump is now fighting in court Spears and iams are friends of james commis and this is the part as bad as it already is this is the part that no one really no one should tell Donald Trump this is the part that will produce one of those leaks from inside the White House about the president raging at his team and at James Comey who continues to drive the president crazy with his book tour three days after President Trump fired James Comey Spears and iams David Spears and Linda Ives wrote a letter with the salutation dear mr. Deputy Attorney General it was to Rod J Rosenstein Deputy Attorney General of the United States the first line was we the undersigned our former United States Attorney's and Assistant United States Attorney's for the Southern District of New York the letter referred to the firing of james comey and mentioned the author's personal relationship with james comey many of us know him personally all of us respect him as a highly professional and ethical person who has devoted more than 20 years of his life to public service the letter addressed the publicly stated reason that President Trump fired James Comey while we do not all necessarily agree with the manner in which he dealt with the conclusion of the Hillary Clinton email investigation we sincerely believe that his abrupt and belated termination for this conduct occurring months later and on the heels of his public testimony about his oversight of the investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election has the appearance if not the reality of interfering with that investigation we are Republicans Democrats and independents the letter was signed by a hundred and eighty former assistant United States Attorney's and United States attorneys in the Southern District of New York the final sentence says as former prosecutors we believe the only solution in the present circumstances would be to appoint a special counsel and we urge you to take that course respectfully submitted and there on the first page of signatories is Linda iams and on the second page is David W Spears the leaders of the law firm that Donald Trump has hired and is paying to defend him in federal court in Manhattan right now Donald Trump's own lawyers called for a special prosecutor because Donald Trump fired James Comey and Donald Trump does not know that and will not know that unless some brave soul working in the white house watching MSNBC right now dares to tell Donald Trump Spears and iams are consul professionals they will fairly and fully and responsibly defend their client Donald Trump's interests without any regard to their own political leanings or the fact that they previously worked with James Comey just like special prosecutor Robert Muller has conducted himself with the utmost in professionalism without any apparent bias being shown in favor of James Comey simply because they once worked together that's the way the best most professional lawyers always operate and for once Donald Trump has the best and most professional lawyers in the Southern District of New York and he has them because he is absolutely terrified of what's happening in that courtroom Michael Cohen on the other hand is represented by a lawyer who has been lied to or or even worse did not tell the truth himself in court to federal judge Kimball wood before Sean Hannity's name was revealed in court yesterday one of Michael Cohen's lawyers Stephen Ryan stood up in court and told the judge this the client was contacted over the weekend and asked that we not disclosed their name and further that we take an appeal if the court was going to make that name public in the next few minutes we learned that that name was Sean Hannity and then last night Sean Hannity said that Michael Cohen's lawyer did not tell the truth in court here's the truth Michael Cole never represented me in any legal matter I never retained his services I never received an invoice I never paid Michael Cohen for legal fees I did have occasional brief conversations with Michael Kohn he's a great attorney about legal questions I had or I was looking for input and perspective and here's the part that could get Michael Cohen's lawyer in very very serious trouble for representing something to the court that is not true now remember Michael Cohen's lawyer Stephen Ryan stood up in court and said to the judge the client was contacted over the weekend and asked that we not disclose their name and further that we take an appeal if the court was going to make that name public Sean Hannity says that that is absolutely not true I never asked Michael Cole to bring this proceeding on my behalf I have no personal interest in this legal matter that's all there is nothing more that's not all there is for Donald Trump and Michael Cohen and now Michael Cohen's lawyer who was either lied to or lied to the court hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
