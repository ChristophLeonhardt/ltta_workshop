>>THE UN HAS DONE A STUDY INTO
POVERTY IN THE UNITED STATES.
HE RECENTLY CONDUCTED AN
INTERVIEW WITH THE LOS ANGELES
TIMES THAT SHOWS YOU JUST HOW
BAD THINGS HAVE GONE INTO THE
UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO
WEALTH INEQUALITY.
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS
IMPACTING EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF
RACE OR GENDER.
ESSENTIALLY HE SAYING THERE IS
NOW A HUGE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE
RICH AND THE POOR AND IT IS
GETTING WORSE UNDER THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
HE COMPILED DATA FOR THIS STUDY
LATE LAST YEAR.
HE IS SAYING THAT THIS WAS A
PROBLEM BEFORE BUT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION HAS EXACERBATED
THAT PROBLEM TREMENDOUSLY.
HE GIVES AN EXAMPLE 
OF WHERE
HAPPENS THE MOST.
>> ANYONE WHO WAS BEEN TO
DOWNTOWN LA KNOWS THAT AT ONE
POINT PEOPLE I KNOW WHO WERE
THINKING OF GETTING AN OFFICE
SPACE DOWNTOWN, THEY WENT DOWN
THERE AND THEY RAN WITH THEIR
HAIR ON FIRE BECAUSE SKID ROW
HAS HOMELESS, BUT A LOT OF
THEM HAVE MENTAL ISSUES.
INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING
CONSTRUCTIVE WITH THOSE FOLKS,
LA JUST PUTS THEM IN ONE AREA OF
DOWNTOWN AND THEY JUST WANDER.
I DON'T MEAN TO DENIGRATE THEM
BUT A LOT OF THEM HAVE
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.
BUT IT IS LIKE ZOMBIES.
PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.
WE JUST PENNED THEM IN ONE
PLACE AND GIVE THEM ALMOST NO
RESOURCES.
>>SOMETHING
DEVASTATING IS HAPPENING IN
DOWNTOWN LA RIGHT NOW.
FOR A LONG TIME SKID ROW WAS
BASICALLY ONE AREA WHERE
YOU WOULD FIND HOMELESS PEOPLE
WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES.
YOU WILL FIND CHILDREN THERE AS
WELL BY THE WAY.
THERE ARE HUGE DEVELOPMENTS
THROUGHOUT DOWNTOWN LA AND THERE
ARE LUXURY CONDOS OR APARTMENTS
AND THE DEVELOPERS KNOW THAT NO
ONE IS GOING TO WANT TO BUY
THOSE EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES IF
YOU HAVE SKID ROW RIGHT BESIDE
THEM.
SO THEY ARE KIND OF PUSHING THEM
OUT THROUGHOUT THE REST OF LOS
ANGELES COUNTY.
AND THE HOMELESS ISSUE IS NOW
SEEN EVERYWHERE.
DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE,
YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE SLEEPING ON
THE STREETS.
>>WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER AND
PART OF THE REASON IS THAT WE
JUST CHOSE NOT TO SPEND ANY
MONEY ON IT.
UTAH HAS AN AMAZING PROGRAM
WHERE THEY BUILT HOMES FOR
THE HOMELESS.
THAT SOUNDS BOTH LOGICAL AND
CRAZY.
IT WORKED.
AND IT COSTS A LOT LESS MONEY.
BUT WE DON'T DO THAT IN LOS
ANGELES.
AND IT IS NOT JUST THE BIG
CITIES.
YOU GO TO PARTS OF KENTUCKY,
ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, AND
YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION
THROUGHOUT THE LAND.
>>AND HE DOES TOUCH 
ON THAT.
ONE
FINAL PART THAT REALLY SPOKE OUT
TO ME BECAUSE A LOT OF US HAVE
BEEN BRAINWASHED INTO
THINKING THIS WAY.
>> IT 
IS A STAT I KEEP TELLING
YOU GUYS.
BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015 THE TOP
200 CORPORATE GIVERS THE
POLITICIANS GAVE $5.8 BILLION TO
POLITICIANS.
WHAT DO THEY RECEIVE IN RETURN?
$4.4 TRILLION.
THEY GOT SO MUCH MORE THAN ANY
WELFARE WE HAVE IN THE COUNTRY
TIMES 10.
WHY?
BECAUSE WE HAVE ENCOURAGED
AND ACCEPTED CORRUPTION.
AND THE CORRUPTION DOES NOT GO
TO THE POOR AND POWERLESS,
IT GOES TO THE RICH AND THE
POWERFUL.
THAT IS WHEN SOMEONE FROM
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY COMES IN,
SOMEONE WHO IS TRAINED IN
SPOTTING THESE PROBLEMS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES AND SAYS OH MY GOD, IT
IS HERE.
AND BY THE WAY IT IS A RACIAL
ISSUE IN A LOT OF PLACES AND
UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE
SEPARATE AND QUITE UNEQUAL
IN A LOT OF PLACES IN AMERICA.
BUT IN A LOT OF PLACES IT IS NOT
RACIAL.
YOU MIGHT SAY THOSE KNUCKLEHEADS
VOTED FOR TRUMP, THEY VOTED
FOR TRUMP BECAUSE HE WAS AGAINST
HILLARY CLINTON.
HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE
ESTABLISHMENT.
IF YOU LIVE IN WEST VIRGINIA AND
THAT ESTABLISHMENT HAS BEEN
SCREWING YOU FOR DECADE AFTER
DECADE, YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING
TO VOTE FOR THEM?
TRUMP WAS A
WILD STAB IN THE DARK AND MAYBE
THEY WOULD'VE VOTED FOR SOMEONE
ELSE BUT THAT IS WHY THERE IS
THIS GREAT ANGER AGAINST THIS
ESTABLISHMENT AND THE
POWERFUL AND THE ELITES IN THIS
COUNTRY.
WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND
THE MEDIA IN WASHINGTON AND
NEW YORK GREATLY UNDERESTIMATE.
