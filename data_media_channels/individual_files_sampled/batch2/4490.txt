joining us now because of a very lucky person is Chuck Rosenberg he's a former US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia a former top aide to Robert Muller he has served in this very senior positions in the Justice Department and the FBI Chuck Rosenberg you are learning about these things as I do I know you are not advanced prepped on this I was I was listening to you read them let me just ask your your top-line reaction if there's anything particularly intriguing to you and what you make of the fact that we are we have access to this well these are fascinating questions I have a bunch of reactions Rachel one we actually knew about a lot of this stuff from your reporting and the reporting of other very good folks in journalism too clear to me from this document that the president is a subject we had heard that before but the types of questions wide what did you know why did you do this how did you react with whom else did you speak suggest to me that the president is clearly a subject a subject as opposed to just being a witness to other people's behavior which is under scrutiny and maybe it's a good idea to go through those categories again you can be a witness somebody who merely sees something or hears something but you have no criminal exposure you can be a target at the far end of the spectrum meaning you're a putative defendant someone likely to be charged with a crime and then there's that big broad middle category subject somebody whose conduct is within the scope of the investigation a third reaction we've been talking generally about obstruction of justice as something that Muller would was would undoubtedly look at okay so many of these questions so many of these topics relate to obstruction of justice right why did you you know the target Andy McCabe or Jim Comey what were your conversations about Jeff Sessions recusal all of those go to the heart of what did the why did the president do what he did why did he make the comments he made why did he put out the tweets that he put out to me this is really interesting then a fourth let me interject don't lose your fourth point but let me just ask you there when there's a number of statements here that are phrased you know what was your opinion what did you think about what was your reaction to what was the purpose of this statement that you made to a reporter at this specific time if those questions are eventually posed to the president the way they're they're structured here seems to me like they're trying to get at the president's State of Mind because the president's State of Mind is a necessary component of any obstruction of justice charge for so second and sort of a segue to my fourth point okay that is the hard thing to prove in an obstruction of justice case what did Rachel Maddow intend to do with the actions that she took and so these questions go right to that intent issue right why was the president doing these things what was his intended effect proving obstruction requires proof of intent to you know in some way interfere with the investigation and many of these questions seem aimed at that and then I guess there's a fifth reaction which these are just topics really there they're styled as questions Rachel but they're really topics because any one of these topics could launch dozens and dozens of follow-up questions depending on what the president says so I imagine that what the Moller team is doing here is giving a broad sort of topical outline to the president's lawyers but by no means should anyone think that there's just you know 40 some-odd questions let me ask you about the process of how these things work obviously questioning the president in a criminal or civil matter is is not exactly like questioning anybody else and there are different types of negotiations that happen around making a president available for some sort of investigation like this but whether or not it's a president when you are trying to get a range and interview when you are approaching a broad complex investigation like this and you've got a high Speight high stakes interview that you want to do as the FBI or as the as Justice Department prosecutors pursuing this sort of thing does it typically work this way where prosecutors or the FBI produces the sort of known universe of things we'd like to ask about in advance before the interview happens internally sure we write these things for our selves do we hand it typically to the people were going to question no that's unusual I can't think of a time that I did that in all of my years as a federal prosecutor but in probably every case I ever prosecuted when it got to the key witness the agents and I would sit down and we would draw up a list of topics we wanted to make sure we didn't forget anything and then we would have some number of documents or emails or bank records that we wanted to show in conjunction with the questions we wanted to ask the other thing you see here and I think it's also important Rachel because how many people they've obviously talked to before they talked to the president and we've discussed this I think on your show and on others you save your most important interviews for last why because you want to talk to everybody else in the entire universe before you talk to your ultimate witness subject whatever the case may be you can see strewn throughout this document lots and lots of names Reince Priebus Sally Yates Andy McCabe Jim Comey Don Magan Coates Pompeo all of these folks we should presume have been interviewed by the Muller team all of them gave the Moller team their best recollection of what happened now they're going to test the president's knowledge or at least they would like to test the president's knowledge against stuff they've already learned I hear you saying that you would prepare a document like this a sort of roadmap to questions for an important interview and you'd use it as an internal document as a prosecutor or as an FBI that's part of an FBI investigation would you are do you ever give an important subject or witness interview a sense of the scope of the questioning so that they can prepare so that so you might say listen we want you to come in we want to talk to you about this this general field of inquiry you would do that sure under certain circumstances perhaps I would sit down with defense counsel not probably not with the person I wanted to interview but with with their lawyers with their lawyers yeah and say look here's a bunch of documents that were going to a expect we're going to ask your client about here are some broad topics that he or she ought to be prepared on mm-hmm that wouldn't be a typical but again typically this type of thing would be an internal document it strikes me as probably a courtesy to the president and his lawyers in advance of any potential interview it seems to me like this is and this is just me spitballing it seems to me that this is either a courtesy to the President and to his legal team in advance of a plan to interview or this indicates that there's not going to be an interview and the special counsel is allowing this stuff to be reported because I think they can some time pretty much control that they're not a very leaky bunch so that we all know the public what questions they believe the president should have had to ask in this map should have had to answer in this matter and and they have to someday in some form but you're quite right the Muller team may not get a chance to interview the president yet if they did you can see what's really on their mind one of the questions here that's listed in the general area of questions related to Mike Flynn what efforts were made to reach out to mr. Flynn about seeking immunity or possible pardon as far as I understand it the president's pardon Authority is almost unchecked the president can pardon anybody for anything on his own terms for any any way that he wants to that's right why would it be legally appropriate for the special counsel's office the FBI to be asking about discussions that the president might have had with Flynn about a possible partner can I give you an analogy sure it's perfectly okay for the president to decide that you ought to be the ambassador to the United Kingdom right you're qualified you're bright you're engaging they're all the things that we would want in an ambassador he has complete authority to nominate you but not in return for a million dollars in cash right and so even though he has the authority to do it what still matters to me and to prosecutors is why was it for some corrupt reason so even an act which he has almost complete authority for could be a corrupt act if done in return for something else maybe your money to become ambassador maybe general Flynn's silence in return for that gift of a pardon hypothetically speaking hypothetically if you offered somebody a pardon or spoke with them suggestively about the possibility of a pardon before that person was going to give testimony that might affect you or something like that that could be an improper use of the power proper the partner thar stay strong I have your back if you have my back I think that would be an improper use of the pardon Authority let me ask you about one of these other questions here that I just I don't it's it's a new topic for me as somebody who's covered this scandal intensively what did you think and do in reaction to the news that the special counsel was speaking to Admiral Mike Rogers head of the NSA Mike Pompeo head of the CIA and Dan coach the Director of National Intelligence we had previously known that the NSA CIA and D&I their leadership had all been interviewed by Muller why would Muller want to ask the president about what he thought about and did in reaction to news that those interviews had taken place right well I think we have to back up a little bit for instance we have reporting including from Jim Comey that the president reached out to him to say flynn's a good guy you might want to consider dropping this you should go easy on him right so if he had a similar conversation with other people Pompeyo Coates and others or had a reaction to conversations he had with other people and share that reaction with folks in the White House absolutely of interest prosecutors why it also goes to intent what was the president thinking at the time that these conversations took place did he tell anybody to do anything about it and that's why I think these Rachele are really topics rather than questions I can imagine each one conceivably taking a very long time to get through as I said we through the show away because this story broke as I was sitting down to start this hour Chuck Rosenberg is somebody who is learning this along with me and is incredibly clear and cogent given the fact that you're absorbing this in real time thank you well my pleasure thank you for doing that on zero notice Chuck Rosenberg former senior DOJ and FB official also former US Attorney and somebody I was lucky very lucky was in the building tonight when this story broke all right again the breaking news right now a remarkable turn in this story the New York Times has not just obtained they have published a list of some four dozen questions that the special counsels office is positing to the sitting president of the United States we do not know whether the president will consent to answer these questions in a formal interview setting we don't know the circumstances of how this story broke and these questions were made public tonight but we do know that Michael Schmidt at the New York Times is the way we got this information and Michael Schmidt joins us live next stay with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
