1
00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:02,591
DESTRUCTION OF THE ORGANIZATION.

2
00:00:02,591 --> 00:00:04,493
>> Sean: I KNOW I LOOK A LOT

3
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:05,261
YOUNGER THERE, BUT THE POINT IS

4
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:07,997
THAT THEY NEED TO CONFIRM HER AS

5
00:00:07,997 --> 00:00:10,633
SOON AS POSSIBLE.

6
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:12,168
FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE

7
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:12,802
PRESENT, FOX NEWS NATIONAL

8
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:14,837
SECURITY STRATEGIST.

9
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:19,008
NRA TV CONTRIBUTOR DAN BONGINO.

10
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,578
WE HAVE GOT TO START.

11
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:23,479
THE PRESIDENT KEEPS MAKING

12
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:24,113
PROMISES AND KEEPING THEM.

13
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:27,750
THE IDEA THAT YOU WILL SUCK UP

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,185
AND BRIBE DICTATORS, AND IF ONLY

15
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:30,853
WE ARE A LITTLE BIT NICER TO

16
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:33,155
THEM AND GIVE THEM $150 BILLION,

17
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:36,125
THEN THEY WILL BE NICE TO US.

18
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,727
WELL, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU

19
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:38,794
IT BLEW THAT OUT OF THE WATER

20
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:41,464
LAST WEEK, AND STILL, PEOPLE

21
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:44,200
WANT TO STAY IN THIS BAD DEAL.

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,633
WHY?

23
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:46,802
>> BECAUSE THEY DON'T LISTEN TO

24
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:47,970
THE PAST.

25
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,371
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HISTORY.

26
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:51,774
I SPENT LAST SUNDAY IN NEW YORK

27
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:53,175
WITH SOME HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS.

28
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,143
LET ME QUOTE A HOLOCAUST

29
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:56,679
SURVIVOR ON HIS LESSONS LEARNED

30
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:57,179
FROM WORLD WAR II.

31
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,515
HE HAD A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE.

32
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,517
WHEN A GROUP OF PEOPLE

33
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:02,551
REPEATEDLY CALL FOR YOUR

34
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:05,154
DESTRUCTION, SOONER OR LATER, TO

35
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:05,721
TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY.

36
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:09,158
WELL, GUESS WHAT IRAN HAS BEEN

37
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:10,893
DOING SINCE 1979?

38
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:12,561
YOU DON'T GIVE THEM PALLETS OF

39
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:12,862
CASH.

40
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:15,564
YOU DON'T SIGN A DEAL THAT

41
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:16,198
REALLY DOESN'T STOP THEM

42
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:18,601
ACQUIRING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

43
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,869
YOU STOP THEM FROM GETTING THE

44
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:22,772
WEAPONS THEY WISH TO USE AGAINST

45
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:24,573
US AND OUR FRIENDS LIKE ISRAEL.

46
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:26,976
THE PRESIDENT KNEW THIS IN HIS

47
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:28,544
BONES.

48
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:29,912
THAT THE DEAL WOULD HAVE TO BE

49
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:30,813
KILLED.

50
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:33,382
HE JUST PUT IT TO 9-MILLIMETER

51
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:34,183
BULLETS AND ITS HEAD.

52
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,851
SHE ONCE YOU KNOW, I DON'T

53
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:36,752
UNDERSTAND HOW WE DON'T LEARN

54
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:39,221
THE LESSONS OF HISTORY.

55
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:41,991
THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN NEGOTIATE

56
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:44,894
OR BRIBE DICTATORS, BRIBE THOSE

57
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:48,330
THAT CERTAIN TO DESTROY AMERICA,

58
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,967
DEATH TO AMERICA, DEATH TO

59
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:52,935
ISRAEL, AND SOMEHOW MONEY AND

60
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:53,469
BRIBERY WILL WORK.

61
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:56,071
THEY WORK IN NORTH KOREA, IT

62
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:58,007
DIDN'T WORK IN THIS DEAL, IT IS

63
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:59,175
NEVER GOING TO WORK.

64
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:00,509
AND I THINK THAT THE ONLY REASON

65
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,244
THAT KIM JONG-UN IS NOW WILLING

66
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:04,613
TO TALK IS BECAUSE THE SHOW OF

67
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:05,514
MILITARY FORCE, THE PRESIDENT

68
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:08,184
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA,

69
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:09,651
AND TO THE FACT THAT KIM JONG-UN

70
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:12,621
KNEW HE WAS GOING TO LOSE

71
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:13,455
EVERYTHING.

72
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:17,359
>> YES, SEAN, A COUPLE THINGS.

73
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:17,927
THE IRAN DEAL FIRST.

74
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:20,663
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE

75
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:21,897
INFORMED THE IRANIANS THERE WAS

76
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:22,598
A DEAL.

77
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:23,699
THIS WAS NEVER A NEGOTIATION, IT

78
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,168
WAS A MANIPULATION.

79
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:27,169
THEY PLAY TO THE ADMINISTRATION

80
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:29,071
FOR FOOLS.

81
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:30,406
I WILL ASK YOU A SIMPLE

82
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:31,040
QUESTION.

83
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,274
LET'S GET SOME COMMON SENSE

84
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:33,275
HERE.

85
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,076
IT DOLLARS TO DOUGHNUTS.

86
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:37,513
THE IRANIANS PREVENTED US FROM

87
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:39,348
LOOKING AT MILITARY

88
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:42,051
INSTALLATIONS TO HAVE THOSE

89
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:42,818
INSTALLATIONS FOR THE PRODUCTION

90
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:44,453
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

91
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:45,855
WHERE THE HECK DO YOU THINK

92
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,723
THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE A

93
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:48,357
NUCLEAR WEAPON?

94
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:49,291
THE LOCAL WALMART?

95
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,093
OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT

96
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:52,194
IN THE MILITARY INSTALLATION.

97
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:53,629
I MEAN, THIS IS COMMON SENSE.

98
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,799
THIS WAS NEVER A DEAL.

99
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,467
THE IRANIANS NEVER HAD ANY

100
00:02:58,467 --> 00:02:59,201
INTENTION OF STICKING TO THIS

101
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:01,170
DEAL, AND I APPLAUD

102
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,671
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THROWING TO

103
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:03,906
STEAL OUT THE WINDOW.

104
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,941
>> Sean: LET'S TALK ABOUT GINA

105
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:08,177
HASPEL.

106
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:08,878
HER PERSONAL COMMITMENT, AND

107
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,147
UNDER MY LEADERSHIP OF THE CIA

108
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:13,716
WILL NOT RESTART THE DETENTION

109
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:15,851
AND INTERROGATION PROGRAM.

110
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,587
I AM ASSUMING THAT MEANS WE ARE

111
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,055
NOT GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER EVENT

112
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:24,059
LIKE 9/11, WHICH I THINK CREATED

113
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:27,997
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

114
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:30,032
SPEAK OUT NOBODY CAN MAKE THAT

115
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:30,399
STATEMENT.

116
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:33,369
I THINK SHE'S FOLLOWING THE

117
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:34,136
DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN

118
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:37,273
THE UNITED STATES SINCE THAT

119
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:37,840
TIME.

120
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,542
I HAVE A SPECIFIC VIEW ON THIS.

121
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,044
I WAS A TRAINED INTERROGATOR IN

122
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:42,578
THE U.K.

123
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:43,479
I'M NOT A MASSIVE FAN OF

124
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,015
ENHANCED INTERROGATION, BUT

125
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:46,782
SOMETIMES, WHEN THERE IS A

126
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:49,885
TICKING TIME BOMB, AND WHEN YOU

127
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,153
MAY BE SAVING THOUSANDS OF

128
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:53,188
LIVES, THEN THAT DECISION MIGHT

129
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,156
HAVE TO BE TAKEN.

130
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,791
AND REMEMBER, AS YOU HAVE TOLD

131
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,259
SO MANY TIMES TO THE AMERICAN

132
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,196
PEOPLE, HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE

133
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:01,997
HUNG UP DURING THE

134
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:02,665
INTERROGATIONS IN AMERICA?

135
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:04,566
THREE.

136
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:06,335
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS.

137
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:08,237
THIS IS NOT SOME SORT OF LABOR

138
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:10,205
CAMP, WHERE WE ARE JUST USING

139
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:10,572
THIS.

140
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:12,207
THE WORST OF THE WORST WERE

141
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:14,410
COMPELLED TO GIVE UP INFORMATION

142
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:14,910
THAT SAVED LIVES.

143
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,212
AT THE END OF THIS.

144
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:18,947
>> Sean: AT LAST WORD.

145
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:21,817
>> YEAH, I AGREE.

146
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:25,554
I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF THAT

147
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,656
INTERROGATION.

148
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:28,324
BUDGET STANDING FOR A LONG

149
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:30,292
PERIOD OF TIME, SLEEP

150
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,627
DEPRIVATION, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A

151
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:33,629
LONG DAY AND THE SECRET SERVICE,

152
00:04:33,629 --> 00:00:00,000
WHERE I USED TO WORK.
