investment decisions what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what</font>

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:17,850
have you learned are the three most

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,230
important things about investing

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,480
management is of critical importance and

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,550
I gave you my examples but there there

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">are certainly many more the second is</font>

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,660
the industry dynamics it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily a bad thing to invest in a</font>

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,350
declining industry or an industry that's

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,000
not growing as long as you pay a low

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,719
enough price but I do think it's hard I

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
do think it's hard you have to really

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,789
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very tough to invest in a business</font>

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,700
that's basically on its way down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,469
and then the third thing is essentially

20
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,180
therefore is strong businesses with

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,649
strong franchises and where you know

22
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,390
they have an enduring product that is

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,010
not going to get too soon remediated

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,079
otherwise dislocated and two of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,239
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> involve real expertise about the</font>

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,920
industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> and meeting management really</font>

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,960
understanding them any advice for

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,640
individual investors do you feel like

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is a game that should be played at</font>

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,869
home or should individuals just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by index</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but I think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that individuals</font>

play this game at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home is insane would</font>

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,100
you take out your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own appendix would you</font>

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,500
write your own will would you fix your

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,500
shows after<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows devoted to telling</font>

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,030
people how to invest their own money and

38
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,970
it is the most absurd thing I have ever

39
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,880
seen of course they shouldn't whether

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,619
they invest<font color="#CCCCCC"> in index fund or pick a good</font>

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,119
mutual fund or give it if they have

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough money to a good money manager</font>

43
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,270
it's crazy it's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy why do</font>

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think that fiction continues to roll</font>

45
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,409
I think it's a little bit like why do

46
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,899
people still invest in movies why do

47
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,700
people invest in racehorses where you

48
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,290
know the average is show you're going to

49
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,090
have a loss because everybody thinks

50
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,040
they can do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better and the</font>

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,770
same is true of investing people why

52
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly i don't know but people who have</font>

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,219
no business<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking it think that they</font>

54
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,780
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do better than the market or else</font>

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,270
they should buy ETFs or something like

56
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,060
that it's I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I almost real I</font>

57
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,440
can't think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a parallel</font>

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,390
to it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other part of one's life</font>

59
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,430
where one is willing to do things

60
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves that they should so obviously</font>

61
00:02:19,170 --> 00:00:00,000
leave to professionals
