1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:01,816
If you can't afford
your medication,

2
00:00:01,816 --> 00:00:03,218
AstraZeneca
may be able to help.

3
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:11,459
>> Tucker: THE LEFT WASN'T

4
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:13,328
GOING TO LET IG'S REPORT GO

5
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:13,962
UNANSWERED.

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:14,996
EARLIER TODAY NEW YORK

7
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:16,398
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARBARA

8
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:17,198
UNDERWOOD ANNOUNCED NEW

9
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:18,433
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE TRUMP

10
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:19,467
FOUNDATION IN NEW YORK.

11
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,036
THE SUIT SEEKS TO DESOLVE

12
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:22,437
THE ORGANIZATION AND BAN

13
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:23,772
TRUMP AS WELL AS HIS THREE

14
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:26,307
CHILDREN FROM SERVING ON ANY

15
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:26,674
NONPROFIT.

16
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:27,442
DONALD TRUMP JR. IS ONE OF

17
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:28,543
THE PEOPLE TARGETED BY THAT

18
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:30,345
LAWSUIT AND HE JOINS US

19
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:30,678
TONIGHT.

20
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:32,814
DONALD TRUMP JR., THANKS FOR

21
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:33,214
JOINING US.

22
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:35,183
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU,

23
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:35,517
TUCKER.

24
00:00:35,517 --> 00:00:36,551
HOW ARE YOU?

25
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:37,385
>> Tucker: I'M DOING GREAT.

26
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:38,586
BEFORE I ASK YOU ABOUT THE

27
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:40,388
SUIT OF THE NONPROFIT.

28
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:41,890
LET ME GET YOUR TAKE ON THE

29
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,591
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT YOU

30
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,259
SAW TODAY.

31
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,427
>> PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

32
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:46,694
I LOOK AT THE ATTORNEY

33
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:47,629
GENERAL HR AT MAJOR

34
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:48,530
CORPORATION, RIGHT?

35
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,831
THEY'RE NOT REALLY THERE TO

36
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:50,665
PROTECT THE INDIVIDUALS.

37
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:51,299
THEY ARE THERE TO PROTECT

38
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:51,800
THE CORPORATION.

39
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,967
>> AS DAMNING AS IT WAS.

40
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,869
>> IT PROBABLY DOESN'T GO

41
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,037
FAR ENOUGH AS IT RELATES TO

42
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:57,272
WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON.

43
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:58,440
I THINK REAL AMERICA, AND

44
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,507
WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR

45
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:00,575
WEEKS AND LAST TIME I WAS ON

46
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:02,310
WITH YOU, REAL AMERICA SEES

47
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,344
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

48
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,447
THEY SEE THAT THESE PHONY

49
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:06,614
PLAYERS AT THE TOP OF THE

50
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:08,016
FBI, NOT THE RANK AND FILE.

51
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:10,218
NOT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

52
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:11,386
THE GUYS DOING THE REAL

53
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:11,686
WORK.

54
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:12,687
THEY SAID THESE LAWYERS THAT

55
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:13,822
NEVER WENT THROUGH THOSE

56
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:15,090
THINGS, HAD NEVER STARTED

57
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,790
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM.

58
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,358
THESE LAWYERS AT THE TOP

59
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:19,194
WERE TRYING TO INFLUENCE AN

60
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:20,562
ELECTION AND THEN UNDERMINE

61
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:22,197
A PRESIDENCY.

62
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:23,031
I LOOK AT JAMES COMEY.

63
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:24,566
IT'S LIKE THE LIBERAL

64
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:25,800
VERSION OF A SORORITY

65
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,134
SISTER.

66
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:27,836
LIKE IT'S PRETTY RIDICULOUS

67
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:28,303
AT THIS POINT.

68
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:30,071
WHEN I SEE WHAT'S GONE ON, I

69
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:31,739
THINK I SEE WHAT EVERYONE

70
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,841
ELSE IN AMERICA IS SEEING

71
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,076
AND THEY SHOULD BE

72
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:35,510
DISGUSTED.

73
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,111
>> Tucker: IF YOU ARE A

74
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:37,045
RIGHT OF CENTER PERSON NOT

75
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,179
YOU SPECIFICALLY ANY PERSON

76
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:41,082
AND YOU WERE CAUGHT UP IN AN

77
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:42,183
FBI INVESTIGATION, WOULDN'T

78
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:43,151
YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THE

79
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:44,419
MAN IDENTIFIED AS FBI LAWYER

80
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,287
NUMBER TWO WASN'T ON YOUR

81
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:46,721
INVESTIGATION?

82
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:47,789
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE

83
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,224
KIND OF IMPORTANT.

84
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:49,924
>> Tucker: WHY DON'T WE KNOW

85
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:51,059
HIS NAME AND SHOULDN'T WE

86
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:51,626
KNOW HIS NAME.

87
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:52,694
>> THAT'S WHAT I DON'T

88
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:53,094
UNDERSTAND.

89
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:53,795
ALL OF THIS STUFF GOING ON.

90
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:54,629
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STUFF

91
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:55,463
AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT

92
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:56,564
WITH YOU ON YOUR SHOW.

93
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:57,365
THE STUFF I HAVE GONE

94
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:58,566
THROUGH OVER THE LAST 18

95
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,801
MONTHS, WHETHER IT BE ABOUT

96
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,568
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

97
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:02,337
IT'S THE BIGGEST DEAL 25

98
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:03,304
HOURS OF TESTIMONY IN FRONT

99
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:03,905
OF CONGRESS.

100
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,106
HILLARY CLINTON DOES 10 FOR

101
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,274
BENGHAZI AND, GUESS WHAT?

102
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:08,276
WHEN SHE AND THE DNC TEAM UP

103
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:10,178
TO PAY A FOREIGN AGENT TO

104
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:11,546
WORK WITH RUSSIA TO COMPILE

105
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:13,815
A FAKE DOSSIER AND SPEND

106
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,083
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO

107
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,851
THIS THING, ALL OF WHICH HAS

108
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,353
BEEN DEBUNKED.

109
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:19,320
NONE OF IT PROVEN.

110
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,522
CHASING THIS THING FOR TWO

111
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:21,089
YEARS.

112
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:21,656
NOTHING.

113
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:23,091
LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENS.

114
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,426
SO I THINK IT JUST SLOWS THE

115
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:26,561
FLAGRANT DOUBLE STANDARD.

116
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,363
IF YOU ARE EVEN CENTER LET

117
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:29,197
ALONE RIGHT OF CENTER YOU

118
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:30,165
WOULD BE GETTING THE SAME

119
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:30,465
THING.

120
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:31,699
IF YOU ARE THE UBER LEFT,

121
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,334
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH AND DO

122
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:34,302
WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT

123
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:35,270
BECAUSE THERE IS NO

124
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,937
ACCOUNTABILITY THERE.

125
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:37,238
I THINK REAL PEOPLE, AGAIN,

126
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:38,706
ARE STARTING TO SEE IT THEY

127
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:41,643
SHOULD BE DISGUSTED.

128
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:43,378
>> Tucker: SO

129
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,579
>> Tucker: NEW YORK ATTORNEY

130
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,114
GENERAL ANNOUNCED A SUIT

131
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:47,382
AGAINST THE CLINTON

132
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:48,950
FOUNDATION FOR -- I'M SORRY,

133
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,285
I GOT THAT WRONG AGAINST THE

134
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:50,952
TRUMP FOUNDATION.

135
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:52,120
>> RIGHT.

136
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,787
>> Tucker: AND YOU ARE NAMED

137
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:53,188
IN IT.

138
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:54,322
>> OF COURSE.

139
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:54,923
>> Tucker: WHAT'S YOUR

140
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:55,423
REACTION TO THAT.

141
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:56,424
>> LISTEN, IT'S NONSENSE.

142
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:58,693
IN THE END THIS IS A

143
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:00,361
CHARITABLE THAT WAS FUNDED

144
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:01,696
50% BY MY FATHER'S OWN MONEY

145
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:04,232
TO GO INTO GOOD DEESDZ.

146
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:05,466
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ERIC

147
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,301
SNEIDERMAN BEFORE HE WENT

148
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,435
DOWN IN A BALL OF FLAMES AS

149
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:09,103
ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE

150
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:10,138
ORIGINAL ME TOO MOVEMENT,

151
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:15,176
YOU KNOW, WAS WORKING ON FOR

152
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:16,945
YEARS WHERE IS HE RIGHT NOW?

153
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:18,079
HE COULDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH.

154
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,847
THEY DO THIS ON THE DAY THE

155
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,249
IG REPORT TO BE ABLE TO

156
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:22,517
DOMINATE THE NEWS CYCLE.

157
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:23,418
GUESS WHAT?

158
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:25,954
MOST OF THE MEDIA WILL CARRY

159
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:27,789
BAGGAGE AND RUN WITH IT LIKE

160
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:28,656
IT'S A BIG THING.

161
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:29,524
IT REALLY ISN'T.

162
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:30,458
THIS IS A MONEY THAT WENT TO

163
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,893
GOOD AND CHARITABLE CAUSES.

164
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:34,262
HALF OF WHICH WAS FUNDED

165
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:34,996
ZERO EXPENSE RATIO.

166
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:36,631
DIDN'T HAVE EMPLOYEES.

167
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:38,266
WASN'T SENDING PEOPLE ON

168
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,767
G-5S ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE

169
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:41,536
THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AT

170
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:42,870
90% EXPENSE RATIO.

171
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,138
THAT'S THE STANDARD AND THE

172
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:45,073
DOUBLE STANDARD BY WHICH WE

173
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,541
HAVE TO LIVE AND WE'LL KEEP

174
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,642
DOING THAT AND KEEP

175
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:48,009
FIGHTING.

176
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:48,943
WE WILL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO

177
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:49,277
DO.

178
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:50,345
BUT I THINK WHAT MY FATHER

179
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,980
IS DOING IS DOING AN AMAZING

180
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,814
JOB IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

181
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:55,116
HE IS SHOWING THIS FLAGRANT

182
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:55,750
DOUBLE STANDARD.

183
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,718
IS HE HIGHLIGHTING IT TO THE

184
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:57,051
PEOPLE.

185
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:57,719
THEY ARE SEEING IT.

186
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,586
THEY ARE FED UP.

187
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,854
AND THEY ARE WATCHING HIM

188
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,289
WIN DESPITE ALL OF THE

189
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:01,756
NOISE.

190
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:03,591
DESPITE ALL OF THE

191
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,459
OBSTRUCTION.

192
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:05,593
DESPITE ALL OF THE HYSTERIA

193
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:06,294
ABOUT ANYTHING THAT DONALD

194
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:06,694
TRUMP IS.

195
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,230
I MEAN, I WATCHED LAST WEEK

196
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,832
COMING FROM SINGAPORE AND

197
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:11,666
WATCHING ALL THESE PEOPLE.

198
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,867
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT

199
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,569
I ALMOST FEEL AS THOUGH THEY

200
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:16,004
WERE HOPING FOR A NUCLEAR

201
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:16,971
WAR BECAUSE THEN THEY COULD

202
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:20,007
SAY SEE, TRUMP FAILED.

203
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,676
IT'S REALLY RIDICULOUS,

204
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:22,010
TUCKER.

205
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,778
IT'S GONE TOO FAR.

206
00:04:23,778 --> 00:04:24,646
>> Tucker: SO JUST TO GO

207
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:25,280
BACK TO THE SUIT.

208
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,481
I JUST WANT TO GET MY HEAD

209
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:27,081
AROUND IT.

210
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,549
IS THE IMPLICATION OR THE

211
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:30,084
CLAIM THAT YOU GOT RICH

212
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,386
BECAUSE YOU'RE NAMED IN IT,

213
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:32,854
THAT YOU GOT RICH BY YOUR

214
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:33,788
AFFILIATION WITH A

215
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:34,155
NONPROFIT?

216
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:35,123
DID YOU GET RICH.

217
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,324
>> I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE

218
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:37,692
CLAIM IS THE CLAIM IS THERE

219
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,227
IS SOMEHOW MISMANAGEMENT.

220
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,895
IN THE END THERE WERE NO

221
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:41,329
SALARIES PAID.

222
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:42,330
THERE IS NO EXPENSE.

223
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,098
THERE ARE NO PAID MEMBERS OF

224
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:44,999
THIS THING.

225
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,434
WE'RE SITTING THERE AS

226
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:47,669
ESSENTIALLY A BOARD TO SEE

227
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:48,803
THAT THE MONEY THAT HE IS

228
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:49,871
PUTTING IN THERE IS GOING

229
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,472
OUT TO OTHER CHARITABLE

230
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:51,806
CAUSES.

231
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:52,807
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

232
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,042
THIS ISN'T THE CLINTON

233
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:54,742
FOUNDATION WHERE THEY ARE

234
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:55,977
TAKING MONEY FROM FOREIGN

235
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:57,512
GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE THEN

236
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:59,113
GIVING TO THEIR FRIENDS TO

237
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:01,049
FLY AROUND ON G-5S FOR

238
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,350
PROJECTS THAT NEVER

239
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:02,750
MATERIALIZE.

240
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,352
YOU KNOW, IT'S REAL A LOT

241
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:04,719
DIFFERENT.

242
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:05,520
YOU CAN SEE A LIST OF ALL

243
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,321
THE CHARITIES I WENT.

244
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,555
TO SAY HALF OF THEM ARE

245
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:08,623
VETERANS CHARITIES.

246
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:09,290
>> Tucker: TO BE CLEAR, YOU

247
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:09,924
NEVER TOOK A SALARY.

248
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,626
>> I HAVE NEVER TAKEN A CENT

249
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:12,860
FROM IT, NO.

250
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,829
NEITHER ABOUT D. MY BROTHER,

251
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,097
DID MY SISTER AND NEITHER

252
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:17,965
DID MY FATHER.

253
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:19,200
>> Tucker: I'M EVEN MORE

254
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,567
CONFUSED.

255
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,268
>> AS AM I.

256
00:05:20,268 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE USED TO IT BY NOW.
