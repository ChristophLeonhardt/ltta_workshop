the automation of robots and artificial intelligence is actually pretty well advanced in in certain industries if you had a chance you've had a chance to go to an auto plant if there's one nearby go take it or shake hands with the robot so you'll see an assembly line that's already robotics the income now is shifting more and more to capital and away from workers and that's part of this general widening of the inequality in the United States and there's more of that to come so our robots are bad things that no because robots enable us to be more productive have a larger economy and if we use it right to have more leisure time to be able to do more good things to have a safer cleaner environment say with self-driving vehicle but we better share the benefit so they don't all end up in the hands of a few very very rich capital owners that's the basic point is yes expand the productivity of the economy use the technology but make sure that the income distribution doesn't go wild one very increasingly common idea for examples make sure that every young person is given a certain amount of basically financial assets or capital it's like saying everyone can own one at least one robot so that the robots get better and better in the future everyone's sharing in the benefits of an expanding economy so I'm not afraid of the technology per se in fact I love it I think it's absolutely amazing that we can have artificial intelligence systems and smart robots and voice recognition and machine learning for translation and so many other fantastic breakthroughs but the market economies will not distribute the results of that fairly and a lot of people will get first unless we sing we're all in this together let's all share the benefits through our fiscal systems and through being smart and Eason in how we approach the robotics revolution
