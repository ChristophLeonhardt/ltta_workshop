hi my name's I Stafford I'm an adventurer on Discovery Channel and I've got a new show out which is left for dead the most discussed anything I've ever eaten is a skunk because I thought I was trapping a rabbit basically made a deadfall trap trap to skunk when it got triggered killed it but then when I was butchering it I cut through the gland that it usually uses to spray gunk people and and I contaminated all the meat so that was actually gross but because I've killed it any I just thought you you've got a way this I'm not gonna allow it to go to waste so it did that was minging I think one of the dodgiest things I've eaten was a year they told me it was a Coomer it was a tribe that gave it to me Thomas of humor ended up being a Jaguar and I which is like a small Jaguar but it had been killing the villages chickens and so they'd shot it and that had been hanging for about three weeks before I was given it and I was you know having to be polite and ate it and all night long and stomach just going and starting vomiting and defecating and quite a lot the most surprisingly pleasant thing was giant armadillo actually which I didn't kill myself but it was killed by an indigenous tribe in the Amazon and just offered up as that you know this is what is available right now for you to eat and I carried got half a giant armadillo with me which is smoked and lasted about a week and it was literally delicious it was just a really refined meat if that makes any sense it was like going into a delicatessen and picking the most I don't know it's like hard far cord it was a like you imagine a ridiculously fancy me but it was just it was just I was pretty hungry at the time you've got to understand um but it was wonderful quite wonderful
