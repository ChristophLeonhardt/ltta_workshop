1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,835
ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT I BE

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,938
ALLOWED TO GIVE MY REMARKS.

3
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:06,505
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: IS

4
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:06,939
THERE OBJECTION?

5
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,741
WITHOUT OBJECTION.

6
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:09,509
MR. RUBIO: THANK YOU,

7
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,876
MR. PRESIDENT.

8
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,612
TWO WEEKS AGO THE TRAGIC

9
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,247
INCIDENT IN PARKLAND, ONE OF

10
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,916
MANY THAT HAVE IMPACTED OUR

11
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,085
COUNTRY OVER THE LAST DECADE AND

12
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,753
BEYOND, AND BOTH THAT COMMUNITY

13
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:21,955
IN PARKLAND, THE RESIDENTS OF

14
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,389
THE STATE OF FLORIDA THAT I

15
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,824
REPRESENT, AND, FRANKLY, THE

16
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,225
ENTIRE NATION HAVE DEMANDED NOT

17
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,528
JUST ACTION, BUT IMMEDIATE

18
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:28,895
ACTION.

19
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,030
WE KNOW AND ANYONE WHO WATCHES

20
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,698
THIS PROCESS IS WELL AWARE THAT

21
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,300
THERE ARE DEEP DIFFERENCES ON

22
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,136
HOW FAR AND HOW MUCH WE SHOULD

23
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:38,271
RESTRICT THE SECOND AMENDMENT

24
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,539
RIGHT OF EVERY AMERICAN.

25
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,509
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE DEEP

26
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:44,344
DIFFERENCES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

27
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,412
SOME OF THOSE PROPOSED

28
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:47,113
RESTRICTIONS WORK.

29
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,715
AND I IMAGINE THAT THOSE DEBATES

30
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,217
AND THOSE DIFFERENCES WILL NOT

31
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,420
BE EASILY RESOLVED AND WILL

32
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:54,787
CONTINUE.

33
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:56,722
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS

34
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,658
WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AND AGREEMENT

35
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,061
THAT WE MUST ACT NOW AS SOON AS

36
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:02,995
POSSIBLE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

37
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,598
TO PREVENT ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE

38
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,200
PARKLAND FROM HAPPENING ANYWHERE

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,867
ELSE EVER AGAIN.

40
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,771
THAT IS A CONSENSUS POSITION.

41
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,173
NO MATTER WHERE YOU FALL ON THIS

42
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:16,509
DEBATE, NO MATTER HOW FAR OR HOW

43
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,810
RESTRICTED RESTRICTIONS ON GUN

44
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,111
SALES IN AMERICA SHOULD BE, NO

45
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:21,514
MATTER WHAT YOUR VIEWS ARE ON

46
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,548
THAT, I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE WHO

47
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,083
IS IN FAVOR OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

48
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,017
AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE WHO

49
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:26,419
IS IN FAVOR OF SEEING ANOTHER

50
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,086
ONE HAPPEN.

51
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,822
THERE IS COMMON GROUND IN THAT

52
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:30,089
REGARD.

53
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:34,126
AND WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO

54
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:38,397
OVERRED THE -- OVER THE LAST

55
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:39,865
COUPLE OF WEEKS IS TO TRY TO

56
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:41,234
DETERMINE WHAT CHANGES IN

57
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,203
FEDERAL LAW WOULD NOT ONLY

58
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:46,038
PREVENTED THIS ATTACK BUT

59
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:46,872
PREVENT FUTURE LAWS.

60
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:50,243
I MET WITH FEDERAL LAW

61
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:50,844
ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS

62
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,113
INVOLVED IN NOT THIS CASE BUT

63
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,047
GUN LAW IN GENERAL.

64
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:58,484
I MET WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS

65
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,118
FROM MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS

66
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,686
HIGH SCHOOL INCLUDING TWO

67
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,621
TEACHERS INJURED IN THE ATTACK.

68
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,222
I MET WITH SCHOOL BOARD

69
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,724
ADMINISTRATORS, THE COMMUNITY AT

70
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,092
LARGE INCLUDING AN APPEARANCE

71
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,094
LAST WEEK AT A NATIONALLY

72
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:08,693
TELEVISED TOWN HALL.

73
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,763
I'VE BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT

74
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:11,831
WITH SEVERAL OF THE PARENTS OF

75
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,799
VICTIMS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES,

76
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:17,336
AND I'VE ALSO SPOKEN TO EXPERTS

77
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:17,937
IN FIREARMS SALES.

78
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,472
I'VE IS SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF

79
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,107
FEDERALLY LICENSED FIREARMS

80
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,175
DEALERS THAT TALK TO YOU ABOUT

81
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:24,076
SOME OF THE FRUSTRATIONS THEY

82
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,811
HAVE WITH OUR EXISTING LAW AND

83
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,280
THEIR INABILITY TO ADDRESS

84
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,481
PEOPLE THAT ULTIMATELY TURN OUT

85
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,616
TO BE INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD NOT

86
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,818
OWN ANY GUN OF ANY KIND.

87
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,787
AND SO BASED ON THESE MEETINGS,

88
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,522
BASED ON ALL OF THIS INPUT,

89
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:37,923
BASED ON ALL THE OTHER RESEARCH

90
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,425
THAT'S OUT THERE LEADING TO

91
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,826
THIS, THE FIRST THING I WANT TO

92
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:43,262
SAY, I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS

93
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:44,730
ATTACK COULD HAVE AND SHOULD

94
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,232
HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF CURRENT

95
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,967
LAW HAD BEEN FULLY ENFORCED.

96
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,502
THIS KILLER WAS A WELL-KNOWN

97
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,436
DANGER.

98
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,904
TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

99
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:55,908
HE WAS A WELL-KNOWN DANGER TO

100
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:56,542
THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S OFFICE.

101
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,244
HE WAS A WELL-KNOWN DANGER TO

102
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,312
HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

103
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,047
HE WAS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF TWO

104
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,082
SEPARATE AND SPECIFIC WARNINGS

105
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,817
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, A

106
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:05,951
CALL TO THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S

107
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,353
OFFICE LAST NOVEMBER, A CALL TO

108
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,655
AN F.B.I. HOTLINE IN JANUARY.

109
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:13,459
IN

110
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,595
-- IN ESSENCE, WE'RE TELLING

111
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,798
PEOPLE, IF YOU SEEING IS, SAY

112
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,132
SOMETHING.

113
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,633
PEOPLE SAW SOMETHING AND THEY

114
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,467
SAID SOMETHING.

115
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,169
OTHER PEOPLE SAW IT OVER A

116
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,738
COURSE OF TIME, AND YET SOMEHOW

117
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,140
THIS DERANGED AND VIOLENT

118
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,942
INDIVIDUAL PASSED A BACKGROUND

119
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:34,380
CHECK AND PURCHASED NOT ONE, BUT

120
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,116
TEN SEPARATE FIREARMS AND THIS

121
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,384
DERANGED INDIVIDUAL WAS ABLE TO

122
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,453
WALK RIGHT INTO SCHOOL A FEW

123
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,754
MINUTES BEFORE DISMISSAL AND

124
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,990
TAKE THE LIVES OF 17 INNOCENT

125
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,324
FLORIDIANS.

126
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:48,661
THIS TRAGEDY IS THE RESULT OF A

127
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,529
MASSIVE, MULTISYSTEMIC FAILURE,

128
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:53,366
A FAILURE INVOLVING FEDERAL

129
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,901
AGENCIES, STATE AGENCIES, LOCAL

130
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,536
AUTHORITIES WHO ALL FAILED TO

131
00:03:57,536 --> 00:04:00,072
BOTH IDENTIFY THE THREAT THAT HE

132
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:01,841
POSED AND COORDINATE A RESPONSE

133
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,577
TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE TOOK

134
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:04,844
ACTION.

135
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,114
AND IT IS THIS FAILURE WHICH I

136
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,949
HOPE WE WILL FOCUS ON BY

137
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,718
ADDRESSING THE SHORTCOMINGS AND

138
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:13,886
VULNERABILITIES IN OUR CURRENT

139
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,755
LAWS AND IN OUR CURRENT

140
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,089
POLICIES.

141
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,658
WE MAY STILL HAVE A DEBATE ON

142
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:22,528
THE BROADER ISSUES OF GUN SALES,

143
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,930
BUT IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT DEBATE,

144
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,133
WE STILL MUST AND SHOULD DO

145
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:27,367
THIS.

146
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,002
SO TODAY I WANTED TO COME HERE

147
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,503
AND ANNOUNCE A COMPREHENSIVE

148
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:31,737
PLAN.

149
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,639
NOT A SIMPLE BILL THAT YOU JUST

150
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,041
VOTE ON AND MOVE ON, BUT A

151
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,877
SERIES OF MEASURES THAT I

152
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,044
BELIEVE COULD PREVENT THESE

153
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,880
ATTACKS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN AND

154
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,148
ALSO HELP SCHOOLS PROTECT THEIR

155
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,316
STUDENTS AND THEIR TEACHERS.

156
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,485
I BELIEVE THESE IDEAS SHOULD

157
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:48,487
ENJOY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND, IF

158
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,523
PASSED, SHOULD AND COULD HELP

159
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,192
PREVENT THE NEXT POTENTIAL MASS

160
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:53,659
SHOOTING.

161
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,828
THESE ARE DETAILS I OUTLINED NOT

162
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,696
JUST BECAUSE THEY WORK BUT

163
00:04:57,696 --> 00:05:00,332
BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN GET THE

164
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:03,436
VOTES TO PASS THEM, 60 IN THE

165
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,505
SENATE, AND THE MAJORITY IN THE

166
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,508
HOUSE AND SIGNED BY THE

167
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:09,842
PRESIDENT.

168
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,177
THESE ARE IDEAS THAT I THINK

169
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,112
WILL ENJOY THAT WIDESPREAD

170
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,947
SUPPORT.

171
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,315
ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT OUR

172
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,083
SCHOOLS ARE NOT PREPARED TO

173
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,252
PREVENT AN ATTACK.

174
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:22,922
IN MY FOLLOWUP MEETING WITH THE

175
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,089
TEACHERS AT THE SCHOOLS, I

176
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,158
LEARNED OF CHANGES TO SCHOOL

177
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,326
FACILITIES OR PRACTICE THAT'S

178
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,295
COULD HAVE STOPPED THE ATTACK OR

179
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,496
IMPROVED THE RESPONSE.

180
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,332
THEREFORE, I WILL JOIN WITH

181
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,134
SENATOR ORRIN HATCH AND OTHERS

182
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,635
TO INTRODUCE THE STOP SCHOOL

183
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:37,570
VIOLENCE ACT.

184
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,738
IF PASSED THIS WILL PROVIDE

185
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,574
FEDERAL GRANTS THAT WILL DO

186
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,075
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE

187
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,712
BEEN HELPFUL, STRENGTHEN

188
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,447
SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE, PROVIDE

189
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:50,850
TRAINING FOR ADMINISTRATORS,

190
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,486
TEACHERS, AND EVEN STUDENTS TO

191
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,321
IDENTIFY THREATS HAND REPORT

192
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:55,555
THEM.

193
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,523
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

194
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,893
IS SCHOOL CRISIS INTERVENTION

195
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:01,127
TEAMS.

196
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,095
THERE IS A SUCCESSFUL TEAM IN

197
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,263
LOS ANGELES THAT DOES THAT.

198
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,799
THAT IS A TEAM BETWEEN LAW

199
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,067
ENFORCEMENT, OTHER STATE

200
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,835
AGENCIES AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

201
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:11,770
WHERE THEY ARE TALKING TO EACH

202
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,372
OTHER ABOUT STUDENTS THAT MAY

203
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,674
POSE A THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND

204
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:16,842
INTERVENE BEFORE THEY ACT.

205
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:19,478
A SECOND ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD

206
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,547
IDENTIFY IS EVEN IF LAW

207
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,282
ENFORCEMENT, SCHOOL

208
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,517
ADMINISTRATORS OR FAMILIES

209
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,920
BELIEVES AN INDIVIDUAL COULD

210
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,889
HAVE AN ACT OF VIOLENCE, THEY

211
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,790
WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM FROM

212
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,526
PURCHASING A GUN OR TAKE AWAY

213
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,494
THE GUNS THEY HAVE.

214
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,663
THEREFORE I INTEND TO INTRODUCE

215
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,532
A FEW LAW, PERHAPS IN

216
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,900
COORDINATION WITH OTHERS, THAT

217
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,570
WILL LEAD TO GUN VIOLENCE

218
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,038
RESTRAINING ORDER, SOMETHING

219
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,275
THAT WILL GIVE FAMILY MEMBERS AN

220
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,976
OPTION TO REMOVE GUNS FROM

221
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:53,045
INDIVIDUALS WHO POSE A THREAT,

222
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,346
AND TO BE CLEAR, THE DUE PROCESS

223
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,215
IN SUCH A SITUATION WOULD BE ON

224
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,118
THE FRONT END, NOT ON THE BACK

225
00:06:59,118 --> 00:06:59,552
END.

226
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,986
THE THIRD ISSUE WE UNCOVERED IS

227
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:03,956
THAT FEDERAL LAW APPEARS TO

228
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,457
DISCOURAGE SCHOOL SYSTEMS FROM

229
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,158
REPORTING DANGEROUS STUDENTS TO

230
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:06,926
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

231
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,261
I DON'T SUPPORT CRIMINALIZING

232
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,664
ALL SCHOOL CONDUCT OR SCHOOL

233
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,065
MISCONDUCT, BUT A STUDENT WHO

234
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,068
HAS THREATENED VIOLENCE, WHO HAS

235
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,602
EXHIBITED VIOLENT BEHAVIOR NEEDS

236
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:18,938
TO BE REPORTED TO LAW

237
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,272
ENFORCEMENT.

238
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,608
A STUDENT THAT HAS QIMENTD A

239
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,811
CRIME BY USE -- ISSUING A THREAT

240
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:26,712
OF DEATH.

241
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,382
THAT NEEDS TO BE REPORTED.

242
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,685
UNDER BROWARD COUNTY SCHOOL

243
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,519
AUTHORITIES, REPORTING A

244
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,589
STUDENT, A DANGEROUS ONE, TO LAW

245
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,991
ENFORCEMENT IS STEP SIX IN THEIR

246
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:39,491
PLAN.

247
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,260
THEREFORE, I INTEND TO PROPOSE

248
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,062
CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL YOUTH

249
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,331
PROMISE PROGRAM SO THAT A SCHOOL

250
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,632
DISTRICT PLAN UNDER THIS PROGRAM

251
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,734
DOES NOT DELAY AND DOES IN THE

252
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,401
DISCOURAGE LAW.

253
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:52,137
FROM BEING ALERTED -- LAW

254
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,839
ENFORCEMENT FROM BEING ALERTED

255
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,574
TO DANGEROUS OR VIOLENT

256
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:55,975
BEHAVIOR.

257
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,377
FOURTH, WE NEED TON

258
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:04,383
STRENGTHEN -- NEED TO STRENGEN

259
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,519
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

260
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,287
FIX NICS WILL INCENTIVIZE EVERY

261
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,389
STATE TO FULLY REPORT RELEVANT

262
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,391
INFORMATION TO THE NATIONAL

263
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,792
BACKGROUND CHECK DATABASE.

264
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,328
BECAUSE A BACKGROUND CHECK IS

265
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,630
ONLY AS GOOD AS THE INFORMATION

266
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,797
THAT IS ON IT.

267
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:21,700
AND THIS DERANGED KILLER WAS

268
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,137
ABLE TO BUY GUNS ON TEN SEPARATE

269
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,505
OCCASIONS BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE

270
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:27,906
PASSED ANY BACKGROUND CHECK

271
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:29,274
BECAUSE NONE OF THIS KNOWN ABOUT

272
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:32,177
HIM WAS REPORTED TO THAT SYSTEM.

273
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,246
FIFTH, WE MUST BEGIN TO

274
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,881
PROSECUTE THE PURCHASE OF GUN BY

275
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,316
PEOPLE PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO.

276
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,485
NEXT WEEK I HOPE TO BE JOINING A

277
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,754
BIPARTISAN GROUP LED BY SENATORS

278
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,957
TOOMEY AND COONS IN FILING THE

279
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,125
LIE AND TRY BILL.

280
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,193
WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE F.B.I. TO

281
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,795
NOTIFY STATES WHEN SOMEONE WHO

282
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,131
IS NOT ALLOWED TO BUY A GUN

283
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,466
TRIES TO BUY A GUN AND FAILS THE

284
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:56,502
BACKGROUND CHECK SO THEY CAN BE

285
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,603
INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED.

286
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,571
IN ADDITION, WE WILL PROVIDE A

287
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:03,776
NEW LAW TO GO AFTER STRAW

288
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,411
PURCHASES WHERE SOMEONE BUYS A

289
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,346
GUN ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE

290
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,847
BECAUSE THAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD

291
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,249
NOT PASS THE BACKGROUND CHECK.

292
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,218
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REFORMS I'M

293
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,853
OPEN TO, THE POSSIBILITY OF

294
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:20,693
LOOKING THE -- AT THE AGE LIMITS

295
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,628
OF SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES, THE

296
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,263
NOTION OF WHAT COULD BE DONE

297
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,665
WITH HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

298
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,367
WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE AND

299
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,601
LOOK AT THOSE.

300
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,937
THESE DO NOT ENJOY THE

301
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:32,738
WIDESPREAD SUPPORT IN CONGRESS

302
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,274
THAT THE OTHER MEASURES I HAVE

303
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,108
SAID DO.

304
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,376
THESE IDEAS WILL HAVE TO BE

305
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,777
CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT CONTRIBUTE

306
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,512
TO GREATER PUBLIC SAFETY BUT

307
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,182
ALSO DO NOT UNNECESSARILY OR

308
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,484
UNFAIRLY INFRINGE ON THE

309
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:49,955
SECOND-AMENDMENT RIGHT OF ALL

310
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:52,591
LAW-ABIDING ADULTS TO HUNT AND

311
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,126
PARTICIPATE IN RECREATIONAL

312
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:54,693
SHOOTING.

313
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:55,761
BUT ULTIMATELY THERE ARE THINGS

314
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,130
THAT WE CAN DO THAT HAVE

315
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,964
WIDESPREAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT

316
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:02,067
THAT WE CAN ACT ON, THAT WE CAN

317
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,936
GET PASSED, THAT WILL ACTUALLY

318
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,770
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

319
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,839
THESE ARE IMPACTFUL THINGS.

320
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,507
I JUST URGE THE SENATE AND THE

321
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,109
HOUSE, ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES

322
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,977
HERE, DO NOT HOLD HOSTAGE A

323
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,245
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL

324
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,114
WORK AND THAT WE ALL SUPPORT

325
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,482
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE

326
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,183
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

327
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:20,285
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN ACT ON

328
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:24,056
AND DO AND THERE ARE THINGS WE

329
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,991
CAN CONTINUE TO ARGUE OVER AND

330
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,860
DEBATE AND PERHAPS VOTE ON IN

331
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,460
THE FUTURE.

332
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,231
BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT COULD

333
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,533
HAVE POSSIBLY PREVENTED THIS

334
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,102
ATTACK AND POSSIBLY FUTURE

335
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:38,370
ATTACKS, LET'S GET IT DONE.

336
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,472
WE OWE IT NOT JUST TO THE

337
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:41,774
FAMILIES AND VICTIMS OF

338
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,275
PARKLAND, BUT TO ALL FAMILIES.

339
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,110
FOR THIS ATTACK MAY HAVE

340
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,716
HAPPENED IN SOUTHERN FLOOR

341
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,684
BUT -- SOUTHERN FLORIDA, BUT

342
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:54,520
THESE ATTACKS COULD HAPPEN

343
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,255
SOMEWHERE ELSE IF WE DON'T FIX

344
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,157
THE LAWS AND THE WAY THAT THEY

345
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:58,957
ARE ENFORCED.

346
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:00,259
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS

347
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,327
INCIDENT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS

348
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:04,196
SYSTEM AND LET US FIX IT AND WE

349
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,931
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO

350
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,566
WHILE WE CONTINUE TO DEBATE AND

351
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,001
WORK ON THE ISSUES THAT WE DO

352
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,902
NOT AGREE ON.

353
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,137
THAT IS WHAT I HOPE WE WILL DO.

354
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:17,810
THAT IS WHAT I HOPE AND WILL DO

355
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,311
EVERYTHING I CAN TO ACHIEVE.

356
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,147
WITH THAT, I YIELD THE FLOOR.

357
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,382
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: ALL TIME

358
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,450
HAS EXPIRED.

359
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,656
THE QUESTION HAS -- HAS OCCURRED

360
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,358
ON THE QUATTLEBAUM NOMINATION.

361
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,660
THERE IS A SUFFICIENT SECOND?

362
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,829
THERE APPEARS TO BE.

363
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,032
THE CLERK SHALL CALL THE ROLL.

364
00:11:41,366 --> 00:00:00,000
VOTE:
