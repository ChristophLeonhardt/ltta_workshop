00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:17,929
MORNING.

6
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:20,532
THEY INCLUDED A RACIST REMARK

7
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:22,567
ABOUT VALERIE JARRETT, TOP

8
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,304
ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.

9
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:27,105
SHE APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY AFTER

10
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:27,839
SHE WAS SEVERELY CRITICIZED BUT

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,175
THAT WASN’T ENOUGH TO SAVE HER

12
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:30,475
SHOW.

13
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:34,112
VALERIE JARRETT RESPONDED ON NBC

14
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:34,446
TONIGHT.

15
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:35,314
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO TURN IT

16
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:36,949
INTO A TEACHING MOMENT.

17
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:37,316
I’M FINE.

18
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,083
I’M WORRIED ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE

19
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,051
OUT THERE WHO DON’T HAVE A

20
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:40,719
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,887
WILL COME RIGHT TO THEIR

22
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:42,221
DEFENSE.

23
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:43,923
THE PERSON WHO WAS WALKING DOWN

24
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:44,857
THE STREET WHO’S MINDING THEIR

25
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:45,691
OWN BUSINESS AND THEY SEE

26
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,393
SOMEBODY CLING TO THEIR PURSE

27
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:50,863
BUT WANT TO CROSS THE STREET.

28
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:51,497
>> Laura: WE ARE JOINED BY

29
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:52,198
ALVEDA KING, FORMER MEMBER OF

30
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:58,437
THE GEORGIA HOUSE OF

31
00:00:58,437 --> 00:00:58,904
REPRESENTATIVES.

32
00:00:58,904 --> 00:00:59,638
THE NIECE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING.

33
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:05,311
I WENT TO START WITH YOU BECAUSE

34
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,079
THIS WAS A BREAKNECK SPEED

35
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,847
CANCELLATION OF THE MOST POPULAR

36
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:11,684
NETWORK TELEVISION SHOW OF THE

37
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:12,018
SEASON.

38
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:12,552
A HUGE SMASH HIT.

39
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:16,656
SHE APOLOGIZED, BUT THE COMMENTS

40
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:18,224
IN THE EYES OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

41
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,326
WERE PRETTY INEXCUSABLE TO SAY

42
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:21,627
THE LEAST.

43
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:23,997
>> YOU KNOW, THIS ACTUALLY IS A

44
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:25,832
TEACHABLE MOMENT.

45
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:30,503
I’M 67 YEARS OLD AND I DO USE

46
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:32,872
SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT I TRY TO STOP

47
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:34,574
AND MAY BE PRAY OR THINK OR

48
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,376
CONSIDER WHAT I’M ABOUT TO TWEET

49
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:39,712
OR PUT ON FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM

50
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:41,281
OR LINKEDIN OR ANY OF THOSE

51
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:44,017
BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL HEAR THAT OR

52
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:47,387
SEE THAT OR READ THAT AND AS YOU

53
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:49,689
SAY, ROSEANNE’S REMARKS MOVE

54
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:50,490
LIKE LIGHTNING.

55
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,658
THEY JUST MOVE EVERYWHERE AND

56
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:55,162
THEN ABC RESPONDED AND I BELIEVE

57
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:55,595
APPROPRIATELY.

58
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:58,298
SAYING WE JUST HAVE TO STOP THE

59
00:01:58,298 --> 00:01:58,598
SHOW.

60
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,900
THERE HAS TO BE A MESSAGE THAT

61
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,735
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE ARE ABOUT.

62
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:06,907
I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A TEACHABLE

63
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:07,240
MOMENT.

64
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,576
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ROSEANNE

65
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:09,910
HERSELF.

66
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,179
>> Laura: I HAVE A QUESTION

67
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:12,579
ABOUT THIS.

68
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:18,218
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO POSSIBILITY

69
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:18,952
OF REDEMPTION IN CERTAIN CASES.

70
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:21,055
YOU HAVE REDEMPTION FOR JOY

71
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:21,488
BEHAR.

72
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:22,389
LET’S REMIND EVERYONE WHAT SHE

73
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:25,726
SAID NOT SO LONG AGO.

74
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:27,161
>> IT’S ONE THING TO TALK TO

75
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:27,895
JESUS.

76
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:29,730
IT’S ANOTHER THING WHEN JESUS

77
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,931
TALKS TO YOU.

78
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:31,332
>> EXACTLY!

79
00:02:31,332 --> 00:02:34,468
THAT’S DIFFERENT!

80
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:37,738
>> THAT’S CALLED MENTAL ILLNESS

81
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:39,407
IF I’M NOT CORRECT.

82
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:40,074
>> Laura: ANDREA MITCHELL

83
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:43,110
POSED THIS VERY ODD QUESTION

84
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,078
TODAY, LET’S WATCH.

85
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:45,546
>> WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO ON SOCIAL

86
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:49,317
MEDIA TO GET FIRED FROM A TOP

87
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:49,984
RATED SHOW ON AN AMERICAN

88
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,889
BROADCAST NETWORK?

89
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,824
>> Laura: GIVEN HER PASSED

90
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:57,725
COMMENTS ABOUT HOMOSEXUALS IT

91
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:59,227
WAS KIND OF IRONIC.

92
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:00,394
>> A LOT OF COMMENTATORS AND

93
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:04,098
COMEDIANS HAVE SURVIVED THESE

94
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:04,799
OFFENSIVE COMMENTS WHEN THEY

95
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,134
HAVE APOLOGIZED.

96
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:10,505
DIFFERENT ONE ROSEANNE BART

97
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:11,306
TOUCHED RACE.

98
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:13,641
IF THIS WAS A SPECTACULAR SELF

99
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,944
IMMOLATION.

100
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:16,911
A NANOSECOND ABC PULLING THE

101
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:17,479
PLUG.

102
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,179
IT COST ABC A LOT OF MONEY BY

103
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,681
THE WAY.

104
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:22,517
ROSEANNE SAID SHE WAS ON TOP OF

105
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:24,519
THE WORLD AND CONTINUE TO SPEW

106
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:24,819
ANGER.

107
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:27,222
>> Laura: YOU SEE THE DOUBLE

108
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:27,589
STANDARD.

109
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:31,293
CHRISTIANS ARE MOCKED AND

110
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,093
RIDICULED, AND ENTIRE CLASSES

111
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:33,929
PEOPLE RIDICULED.

112
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:35,997
SOMEONE IS WAS AN APOLOGY, MAYBE

113
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:38,133
MAKES A PHONE CALL AND CAREER

114
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,568
PRESERVED.

115
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:41,470
>> IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW THE

116
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,438
ISSUE OF RACE HAS REACHED A

117
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:44,840
FEVER PITCH BOILING POINTS.

118
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,309
IF WE HAVE GOTTEN THE MESSAGE

119
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,878
YET FROM MY UNCLE FOR EXAMPLE,

120
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:50,646
REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.,

121
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:52,881
WE MUST LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER

122
00:03:52,881 --> 00:03:55,317
AS BROTHERS OR PERISH TOGETHER

123
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,118
AS FOOLS, WE ARE NOT

124
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,152
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE ONE

125
00:03:57,152 --> 00:04:00,689
RACE, ONE HUMAN RACE SO WE ARE

126
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:03,292
STILL IN THESE RACE WARS AND

127
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:04,026
BATTLING.

128
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:06,495
IT’S JUST AN ABSOLUTE TERRIBLE

129
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:08,130
THING TO TAKE A RACIAL SLUR AND

130
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,698
KIND OF THROW IT OUT THERE LIKE

131
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:10,299
THAT.

132
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:11,200
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

133
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,869
HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL

134
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:17,339
AS HUMAN BEINGS, RED-BLOODED

135
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,774
HUMAN BEINGS, OUR SKIN COLOR

136
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:19,575
REALLY DOESN’T DEFINE US, IT’S A

137
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,711
CHARACTER THAT DOES.

138
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,079
WE ARE NOT COLOR-BLIND.

139
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,880
WE CAN SEE ETHNICITY AND WE

140
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,182
SHOULD BECAUSE IF WE IGNORE OR

141
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,984
SAY WE CAN’T SEE SKIN COLOR AND

142
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:30,086
WE CAN’T SEE THE OPPRESSION AND

143
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,989
THE WRONGDOING THAT HAPPENS EVEN

144
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,557
DOWN TO THE LITTLE BABIES IN THE

145
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:37,093
WOMB ALL THE WAY TO ALL PEOPLE.

146
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,494
SO FIGHTING OVER SKIN COLOR

147
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,495
REALLY IS THE PROBLEM BUT THAT’S

148
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,564
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND

149
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:43,900
THAT’S WHY I SAY IT’S A

150
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,500
TEACHABLE MOMENT.

151
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,135
THE RACISM REALLY DOES HAVE TO

152
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:47,503
GO AND WE REALLY HAVE TO BEGIN

153
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:48,538
TO REGARD AND RESPECT EACH OTHER

154
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,940
AS HUMAN BEINGS.

155
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,344
>> Laura: HEAR, HEAR.

156
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:56,312
DID ABC NOT KNOW THOUGH WHAT

157
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,715
THEY WERE GETTING WITH ROSEANNE?

158
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,949
VENTURE WAS COMMENTS IN

159
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:01,284
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS THAT YOU

160
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,252
CAN’T CONTROL ROSEANNE.

161
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:03,319
LET’S GET HOW WE END ON THIS.

162
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,954
MANY WHO HAVE TRIED AND FAILED.

163
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:06,923
SHE’S THE ONE AND ONLY.

164
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,258
>> ABC KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS

165
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,093
GETTING WITH ROSEANNE.

166
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,127
SHE HAS BEEN SPREADING

167
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:12,629
CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT 9/11

168
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:15,465
TO NAZIS FOR MANY YEARS.

169
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,201
IT WAS A GAMBLE THAT SHE WOULD

170
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,703
ZIPPER LEFT AND IT DID CREATE A

171
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:20,303
FUNNY SHOW.

172
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,605
TOUCH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE

173
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:23,440
COUNTRY BUT ABC CANNOT CLAIM TO

174
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,141
BE BLINDSIDED.

175
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,109
THERE’S ONE MORE POINT HERE.

176
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,312
I WAS JUST WAITING, COUNTING

177
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:29,012
DOWN CNN’S DON LEMON.

178
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:31,114
ROSEANNE AT PRESIDENT TRUMP.

179
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,349
>> Laura: THEY ARE PUTTING IT

180
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:33,450
ALTOGETHER.

181
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,318
>> EVEN VALERIE JARRETT WAS

182
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:35,252
TAKING THE HIGH ROAD AND SHE WAS

183
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,957
SORT OF BLINDSIDED HERE.

184
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:42,126
THIS HAS NOTHING TO    TO DO WIH

185
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:42,559
DONALD TRUMP.

186
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,762
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TURNED

187
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:45,763
EVERY NEGATIVE CONTROVERSY INTO

188
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,196
A TRAP STORY.

189
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:49,633
>> Laura: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

190
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,101
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT TYING

191
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,102
THIS TO DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS

192
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,539
WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IN TWEETS.

193
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,775
THE GUY FROM SCANDAL, ACTOR

194
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,943
JOSHUA MOLINA SAID ABC IS

195
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:03,114
GREATER THAN G.O.P.

196
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,982
OTHERS TWEETING SIMILAR THINGS,

197
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:05,616
DONALD TRUMP CREATED THIS

198
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,918
ATMOSPHERE FOR SOMEONE LIKE

199
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,754
ROSEANNE TO TWEET THAT THINKING

200
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:11,689
SHE PROBABLY COULD GET AWAY WITH

201
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:13,524
IT.

202
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:14,492
>> I BELIEVE ROSEANNE PERHAPS.

203
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,661
AS I SAY, TEACHABLE MOMENT.

204
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,930
JUST THOUGHT SHE COULD SAY OR DO

205
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,131
WHATEVER SHE THOUGHT.

206
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,532
>> Laura: BUT DID DONALD TRUMP

207
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:23,301
CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE?

208
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,135
>> NO, NO, NO.

209
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,336
NO HE DID NOT.

210
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:26,237
I VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP.

211
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:28,940
I’M NOT A RACIST.

212
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,242
>> Laura: I THINK THAT’S

213
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:31,576
OBVIOUS.

214
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:34,946
>> WE ARE NOT RACIST.

215
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:36,781
TO TIE THIS ONE PARTICULAR ACT

216
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:37,749
FROM ONE PARTICULAR PERSON AND

217
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:41,352
SAY THAT IT’S DONALD TRUMP --

218
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:42,087
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S FAULT,

219
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:43,555
THAT’S JUST NOT TRUE.

220
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:45,724
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT DO

221
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:46,024
THAT.

222
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:46,725
>> Laura: WILL SOMEONE ELSE

223
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:48,960
PICK UP THE SHOW?

224
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,128
>> I THINK IT’S VERY HARD TO

225
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:51,563
COME BACK FROM THIS KIND OF

226
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:52,330
RADIOACTIVE CONTROVERSY.

227
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,532
>> Laura: SO NO ONE WILL PICK

228
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:54,299
UP THE SHOW?

229
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:55,367
THE MOST POPULAR SHOW OF THE

230
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:55,667
YEAR.

231
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,102
NO ONE WILL PICK IT UP?

232
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,570
ANY OF THE CAST AND CHARACTERS?

233
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,138
THEY ARE ALL OUT OF JOBS.

234
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:00,972
>> SOME OF THE PEOPLE WERE

235
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,574
SAYING THEY WERE LEAVING.

236
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:04,543
THAT’S THE SAD THING HERE.

237
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:05,844
WITH THIS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ACT,

238
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,512
ALL THE WRITERS AND TAPE EDITORS

239
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:08,580
AND PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT BE SO

240
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,916
EASY FOR THEM TO FIND JOBS,

241
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:11,350
THEY’LL GET --

242
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,185
>> Laura: IT’S A SHAME.

243
00:07:13,185 --> 00:00:00,000
I SELECT ONE MINUTE OF IT.
