1
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:11,448
He has ripped one doctor's

2
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:13,518
pocket off his shirt.

3
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:18,313
He's bit a couple of other people along the
way.

4
00:00:18,313 --> 00:00:22,678
>> [SOUND] I hear him now.

5
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:24,600
Oh my goodness.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,332
He's mad.

7
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:30,536
>> [SOUND]

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,061
People with intellectual disabilities have a
very

9
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:42,068
difficult time accessing good quality health
care.

10
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:44,698
>> It's not uncommon to hear a parent or

11
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:49,058
a guardian say the last time we went to a
dental office or a medical office,

12
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:54,008
we were told, get your son or your daughter
out of here and don't ever bring them back.

13
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:57,518
Our professions have turned their back on
them in many cases.

14
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:01,458
>> Well, recently, an ambulance refused to
transport him to

15
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,368
the hospital because of his autism.

16
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:08,878
He was transported to the hospital by a
police officer.

17
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:12,528
>> We have generations of physicians in
Venice who have been trained, and

18
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:15,668
that training didn't include taking care of
adults with developmental disabilities.

19
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:17,058
Lee Specialty Clinic, how can I help you?

20
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:21,008
>> All of our clinicians here have
exceptional expertise and

21
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:22,888
experience focused on this population.

22
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:26,158
>> You're ready for about a ride cookie,
dude?

23
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:27,838
>> Feels like we're forgetting something.

24
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:28,348
>> All yours.

25
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:32,958
>> Oh, change of pants just in case.

26
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,638
>> Due to Trey's autism, he's an odd little
fellow.

27
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:42,758
Trey was actually a joy until he hit puberty.

28
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:44,478
>> All right, Trey.

29
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:45,208
Let's go, buddy.

30
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:49,408
>> He became just extremely self-abusive.

31
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,208
He's going to go see his friends.

32
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,938
It kills me to have to restrain him and

33
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:01,938
it's amazing how many doctors, I have sat
there with the phone book and

34
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:08,948
literally called one after another to try to
get him into a certain specialist.

35
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:12,638
The answer I love the most is we are not
taking any

36
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:19,018
new Medicaid patients at this time when they
hear he's challenged.

37
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:22,358
It's been really hard to even find anyone to
take him,

38
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:27,368
much less the experience when you go into a
waiting room.

39
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:31,258
Everyone's staring and you know, why is he
like that?

40
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:34,138
>> Momma, Mom, Momma.

41
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:35,208
>> We have a term for that.

42
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,457
We call it Waiting Room Syndrome.

43
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,328
.

44
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,038
It's a syndrome that the doctors have.

45
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:42,858
It's the fear that the patient with the
disability is going to scare the other

46
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:46,908
clients or make the other patients
uncomfortable who are in that waiting room.

47
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:48,298
>> Additionally, it takes more time.

48
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:52,518
>> We're living in a time now when a doctor
may be in the room with you for

49
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:56,688
five minutes, if you're lucky, and you just
can't do that with this population.

50
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:01,458
What makes this facility different is we
offer medical care,

51
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,808
dental care, psychiatric, physical therapy,
occupational therapy,

52
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:08,878
speech therapy, all focused on people with
intellectual developmental disabilities.

53
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,658
>> When you have a child like this who can't
communicate and

54
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,508
has you know, complex issues, and has
challenging behaviors,

55
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:24,598
you can't go around to typical doctors
because they're not familiar with autism.

56
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:27,788
>> Danny also has SIB, or self injurious
behaviour,

57
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:32,578
where he hits himself and he's had a
cauliflower ear on this side.

58
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,188
He had surgeries last summer.

59
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:36,118
>> You can see the hair loss.

60
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:42,928
We, thankfully, got referred here and we
started addressing what all the physical or

61
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:45,998
dental problems could possibly be that might
contribute to this,

62
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:48,218
which we're still dealing with.

63
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:52,438
>> When you attribute a behavior to the
disability rather than looking for

64
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,878
an underlying cause, they'll start to
medicate the behavior.

65
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,008
In this population, often times there's an
underlying physical diagnosis that

66
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:04,473
is actually causing pain or discomfort and
because our patients sometimes have

67
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:11,018
limited verbal abilities, their method of
communicating to us is that behavior.

68
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,958
>> So this pain, anywhere?

69
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,098
>> He usually starts here first to give us
the signal.

70
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:23,758
Sometimes he can't decipher, he just knows he
hurts, so.

71
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:27,858
>> Sometimes people have dental pain, for
example, and the physical self-injurious

72
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:33,148
behavior might be the person actually doing
this, tapping on the part that hurts.

73
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,588
Funding is also a problem.

74
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:37,948
When a patient with an intellectual
disability reaches the age of 18

75
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:40,228
in the United States, they fall off a cliff.

76
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:41,888
A funding cliff.

77
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:47,258
Public assistance, medical assistance
services and programs just dry up.

78
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:53,348
>> In the past, when I've tried to do
anything else, punch a clock, so

79
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:59,198
to speak, it never works out because Trey
could be having a bad day,

80
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:03,288
so I've cleaned houses most of his 33 years.

81
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:06,908
The older he's gotten, the more frustrated
he's gotten.

82
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:10,218
Haven't been on vacation in at least 10
years.

83
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:14,466
It's hard for me to say, I would really like
to find placement for

84
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:18,428
him while I'm still young enough to oversee
it.

85
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:26,778
He's been on a waiting list at one facility
since he was 18 yearsold.

86
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:29,508
>> We solve the problem of healthcare here at
this clinic but for

87
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:32,134
the parents, healthcare's just one piece of
their life.

88
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,114
Everything that they do.

89
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:37,118
>> Is more complicated.

90
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:40,418
>> Mama, mama.
>> There's my boy.

91
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:43,938
>> Mama.
>> There's my boy.

92
00:05:43,938 --> 00:00:00,000
