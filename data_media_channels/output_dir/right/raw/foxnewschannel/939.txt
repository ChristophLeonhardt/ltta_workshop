1
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:04,168
CLEARLY -- IF THE PRESIDENT

2
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:07,604
FAILS, THE WORLD FAILS.

3
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:09,573
JOINING US NOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF

4
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:11,108
NEWS TO GET TO.

5
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:13,410
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,812
CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES.

7
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:16,413
MR. CHAIRMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

8
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:17,681
THE FIRST THING I WANT IS YOUR

9
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:21,218
REACTION TO ROD ROSENSTEIN, A

10
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:23,020
TWO-PART QUESTION.

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,025
DID HE THREATEN TO SUBPOENA THE

12
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,226
EMAILS OF VIEW, OTHER MEMBERS OF

13
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:34,031
CONGRESS, YOUR STAFF, AND OTHER

14
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:34,431
DOCUMENTS?

15
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:37,134
BECAUSE HE HAD ONE OF HIS TEMPER

16
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:39,970
TANTRUMS AND GOT ANGRY?

17
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:41,238
LIVE IN SINGAPORE.

18
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:42,072
I THINK YOU SHOULD COME AWAY

19
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:43,440
EVENTUALLY BUT I ENJOY SEEING

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,807
YOU THERE.

21
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:46,043
LISTEN, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON

22
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:46,677
FOR -- SINCE LAST AUGUST.

23
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:51,615
WE SUBPOENAED THEM IN LAST

24
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:52,216
AUGUST.

25
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:53,417
WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET

26
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:53,817
DOCUMENTS.

27
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,219
WE CAN'T GET DOCUMENTS.

28
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:58,322
WE'VE HAD MANY, WHAT I WOULD

29
00:00:58,322 --> 00:00:58,989
SAY, ALTERCATIONS WITH THE

30
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,724
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS

31
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:02,259
STAFF.

32
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,460
WHAT I THINK IS INAPPROPRIATE --

33
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,260
I AM FINE.

34
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,562
I CAN TAKE THE HEAT.

35
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:06,630
YOU CAN ATTACK ME ALL YOU WANT.

36
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,031
I'M USED TO IT.

37
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:08,832
I ENJOY.

38
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:10,634
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ATTACKING

39
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,069
STAFF AND WHEN THE STAFF FEELS

40
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:12,703
UNCOMFORTABLE, THAT'S WHEN

41
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:16,406
YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR.

42
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:17,608
THE STAFF ARE CITIZENS OF THE

43
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:18,942
UNITED STATES WHO WORK HARD FOR

44
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:20,410
THEIR COUNTRY, THEY ARE

45
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:20,811
PATRIOTS.

46
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:22,346
THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

47
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:23,280
COME ON TELEVISION LIKE I DO AND

48
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,683
PLEAD MY CASE.

49
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:28,185
LOOK, THE STAFF DEFINITELY HAVE

50
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:29,486
FELT THREATENED.

51
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:31,021
JUST RECENTLY, THE STAFF WERE

52
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,623
ALL KICKED OUT OF THE ROOM.

53
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:33,357
WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE CONCERNED

54
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:37,294
ABOUT THE MOST RIGHT NOW IS

55
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:39,163
OBSTRUCTION OF A VALID

56
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:39,897
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION BY

57
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:40,998
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

58
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:42,599
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU JUST ONE

59
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,434
POINT, AND I WILL GO BACK TO

60
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,469
YOU, SEAN.

61
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:46,570
ONE SIMPLE POINTS.

62
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,371
WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS

63
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:49,740
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

64
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,707
FISA ABUSE AND OTHER MATTERS.

65
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:52,009
WE NOW ARE AT THE END.

66
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,812
WE DOCUMENTS.

67
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:56,346
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT

68
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,315
ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THIS

69
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,083
SITUATION.

70
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:00,784
IN THE LAST WEEKS, THEY HAVE

71
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:02,786
KICKED OUT THE STAFF.

72
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,254
THE LEAD INVESTIGATORS ON THIS.

73
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,956
NOW THEY HAVE KICKED OUT ALL THE

74
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:07,024
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

75
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:08,225
MEMBERS, SO THE ONLY ONES THAT

76
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,494
ARE GOING TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTS

77
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:12,429
TO THE WHOLE ENTIRE HOUSE OF

78
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:13,831
REPRESENTATIVES, ONLY TO

79
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,231
REPUBLICANS.

80
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:16,633
PAUL RYAN, THE SPEAKER, AND

81
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:16,967
MYSELF.

82
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:18,068
THIS IS TOTALLY ACCEPTABLE.

83
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:20,037
IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF

84
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:21,638
OBSTRUCTION OF A CONGRESSIONAL

85
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:22,239
INVESTIGATION.

86
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,508
AT THE PROBLEM WE HAVE HERE IS,

87
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:26,977
WHO'S GOING TO INVESTIGATE THE

88
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:27,644
INVESTIGATORS?

89
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:31,548
>> Sean: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

90
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:32,683
A STAFFER, CASH PER TOWEL.

91
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:35,018
IS HE THE ONE OR ONE OF THE

92
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,186
PEOPLE WHO GOT KICKED OUT OF THE

93
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:36,486
ROOM?

94
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:41,024
I REALLY WANT TO KNOW, WHEN YOU

95
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,793
THREATEN AND INTIMIDATE, TO USE

96
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:45,128
THE POWER OF THAT OFFICE, BEING

97
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,730
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL,

98
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,866
ISN'T THAT ITSELF A FORM OF

99
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:51,034
OBSTRUCTION COMMANDOS THAT

100
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:51,902
RAISED THE QUESTION OF

101
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:52,536
IMPEACHING ROD ROSENSTEIN?

102
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:54,571
>> I WILL TELL YOU, I WOULD

103
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,639
RATHER NOT GET INTO THE NAMES OF

104
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,173
THE STAFF.

105
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:59,443
IT'S MORE THAN ONE.

106
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:00,477
FOR THE PARTICULAR INCIDENT,

107
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:01,411
THERE WERE THREE STAFF IN THE

108
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:02,579
ROOM BUT THERE'S BEEN MANY

109
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,249
OTHERS THAT HE FELT THREATENED

110
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,283
DIFFERENT LEVELS BY THE

111
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:06,917
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

112
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:19,263
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN INTIMIDATED.

113
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:19,529
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN INTIMIDATED.

114
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:20,163
OUR MEMBERS HAVE NOT BEEN

115
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:20,564
INTIMIDATED.

116
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:21,298
BUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE NOW, HOW

117
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:21,999
DO YOU GET TO OBSTRUCTION, HOW

118
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:22,599
DO YOU GET TO MISLEADING

119
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:22,966
CONGRESS?

120
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:23,667
TAKING THIS INFORMATION WE'VE

121
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,401
BEEN LEGALLY ASKING FOR, A LEGAL

122
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,102
SUBPOENA THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

123
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:25,702
ENFORCE, AND YOU MOVE IT

124
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:26,436
UPSTAIRS AND SAY NO, NO, IT'S

125
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:27,404
GOING TO BE SUPER TOP-SECRET

126
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:29,239
INFORMATION THAT WE ARE ONLY

127
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,308
GOING TO GIVE TO THE GANG OF

128
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:31,642
EIGHT.

129
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:32,409
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

130
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:34,845
PEOPLE IN AMERICA SHOULD BE

131
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:35,279
ALARMED.

132
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,480
THIS IS A WAY TO HIDE

133
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,048
INFORMATION NOT ONLY FROM THE

134
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:40,017
AMERICAN PEOPLE BUT TO THEIR

135
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:41,251
CONGRESSMEN.

136
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:44,221
AND TO THE STAFF THAT WORK FOR

137
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:44,521
THEM.

138
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:46,857
>> Sean: HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY

139
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:47,925
GET IT?

140
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,227
IS IT TRUE THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN

141
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:53,530
BLEW UP AT YOU A NUMBER OF TIMES

142
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,799
AND THAT HE HAS A HORRIBLE

143
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:56,133
TEMPER?

144
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:59,436
AND DO YOU VIEW HIS THREAT AS A

145
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,038
FORM OF OBSTRUCTION IN AND OF

146
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:01,872
ITSELF?

147
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:02,773
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION,

148
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:04,574
WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD REMAIN

149
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:05,242
IN THAT ROLE.

150
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:06,910
>> LET ME ANSWER THE FIRST PART.

151
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,949
I HAD TO PSYCHOANALYSIS ON ROD

152
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:12,349
ROSENSTEIN.

153
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:13,684
BUT I CAN TELL YOU IS THE

154
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:16,853
BEHAVIORS ON ACCEPTABLE.

155
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:18,355
HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE

156
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:18,721
DOCUMENTS.

157
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:21,458
I SAID THIS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO

158
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,426
ON MARIA'S SUNDAY MORNING SHOW

159
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:23,226
ON FOX.

160
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,728
I SAID LOOK, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO,

161
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:26,463
IF YOU -- IF THERE IS NO FISA

162
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:27,998
ABUSE HERE, NO PROBLEMS WITH THE

163
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:30,434
FISA APPLICATION, IF THERE WERE

164
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:31,969
NO PROBLEMS, INFORMANTS WERE

165
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,637
SPIES OR WHATEVER WERE RUN INTO

166
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:34,371
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COME ALL YOU

167
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:36,640
HAVE TO DO IS SHOW THE HOUSE

168
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,175
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ALL OF

169
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,209
THE DOCUMENTS.

170
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:39,876
LET THE INVESTIGATORS COMB

171
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:42,379
THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS.

172
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,414
WE ARE NOT GETTING MAD.

173
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,684
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

174
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:49,853
WE WOULD EXONERATE THEM IN A

175
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:50,854
SECOND.

176
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:51,855
WHERE DOES THIS LEAD?

177
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:52,656
TOMORROW WE HAVE THE IG REPORT

178
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:54,858
COMING OUT.

179
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:56,727
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE

180
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:57,594
FIRST STEP FOR AMERICA AND THE

181
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:00,030
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE

182
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,665
FBI BEGIN THE HEALING PROCESS.

183
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:02,933
THE HEALING PROCESS WOULD BE

184
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,836
MADE MUCH EASIER IF WE COULD

185
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:06,837
COMPLETE THAT BY THEN DELIVERING

186
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,239
ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS TO US.

187
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,440
TOMORROW THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO

188
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,042
DELIVER DOCUMENTS TO THE SPEAKER

189
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,276
AND MYSELF.

190
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:14,444
WE INFORMED EVERY REPUBLICAN

191
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,580

ACCEPTABLE.

195
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:21,685
AN INVESTIGATION THAT WE

196
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,253
STARTED --

197
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:26,323
>> Sean: HOW DO YOU STOP IT?

198
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:29,659
>> TWO WAYS.

199
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:32,229
WE CAN HOLD MR. ROSENSTEIN AND

OTHERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

201
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,631
JUSTICE IN CONTEMPT AND IMPEACH.

202
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:35,365
THE OTHER WAY WOULD BE FOR THE

203
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:37,367
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

204
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:40,070
TO DEMAND THEM, TO ORDER THEM TO

205
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,271
GIVE US ALL THE DOCUMENTS.

206
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:43,306
THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY TWO

207
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:43,607
WAYS.

208
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:44,274
>> Sean: THE PRESIDENT NEEDS

209
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:45,242

THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO HEAR THIS

211
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:47,277

212
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,546
ARE YOU WILLING TO GO, SIR, AS

213
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:50,047
FAR AS IMPEACHING?

>> WELL I AM    AM ALREADY PAST.

215
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:57,020
I WANTED TO MOVE TO CONTEMPT

216
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,421
MONTHS AGO.

217
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:58,255
THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE

218
00:05:58,255 --> 00:05:59,656
BELIEVES HE CAN WORK WITH DOJ

219
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:00,857
AND WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:02,059

221
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:05,262
BUT I CAN TELL YOU MY PATIENCE

222
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:06,229
HAS RUN OUT.

223
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:06,730
I HAVE NONE LEFT.

224
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,633

IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

228
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:17,140

>> Sean: WE CANNOT HAVE A

00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:23,046
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE

231
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:24,815
