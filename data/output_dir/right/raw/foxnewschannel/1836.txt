19
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:25,917
ABOUT THIS QUOTE THAT WAS IN THE

00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:27,319
WASHINGTON TIMES.

21
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,754
IN TALKING ABOUT THE PARKLAND

22
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:30,922
SURVIVORS, THE YOUNG PEOPLE NOW

23
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:31,857
CAMPAIGNING AGAINST SECOND

24
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,458
AMENDMENT AND GUN OWNERSHIP,

25
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,926
WHAT THEY DID VERY SUCCESSFULLY

26
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,329
WITH A FRONTAL ASSAULT AND NOW

27
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,164
INTIMIDATION AND SEXUAL

28
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:39,765
HARASSMENT?

29
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:43,368
LAW BREAKING HAS DISCUSSED TO

30
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:44,970
PEOPLE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

31
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:46,505
BEFORE WE MOVE TO KNOW SOME MORE

32
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,005
IMPORTANT STUFF.

33
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,008
FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE NEVER

34
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,776
DISPARAGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE

35
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:52,744
STUDENTS OR THE FACULTY AT THAT

36
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:53,078
SCHOOL.

37
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:53,879
EVERYTHING I SAID OR WROTE, MOST

38
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,450
OF IT ON THIS NETWORK AND FOR

39
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,087
FOX NEWS.COM WAS PALPABLE BRING

40
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:04,355
IN AFFAIR OF THE HEROISM

41
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,590
DISPLAYED BY SO MANY OF THEM

42
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,225
HAVE I SINGLE OUT ONE OF THE

43
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,293
YOUNGSTERS WAS KILLED TRYING TO

44
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:09,961
SAVE HIS CLASSMATES AND

45
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,362
SCHOOLMATES.

46
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,364
SO IT'S AN UNFAIR

47
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:12,964
CHARACTERIZATION.

48
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:14,166
WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO

49
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,734
SPECIFICALLY IN THAT ARTICLE

50
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:16,535
WASN'T THE STUDENTS.

51
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,069
THE STUDENTS I BELIEVE ARE BEING

52
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:19,337
USED, PERHAPS IN WAYS THAT MANY

53
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:21,673
OF THEM DON'T UNDERSTAND.

54
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:22,974
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN LAUNCHED

55
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:25,444
AGAINST NRA, WE JUST SAW IN

56
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:26,778
TRACE'S REPORT, THE LAWSUITS.

57
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:29,281
THERE IS A LEGAL -- THERE IS A

58
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,248
CYBER ATTACK.

59
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:31,817
THERE IS A DIRECT HARASSMENT.

60
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,452
THERE'S THREATS, THERE'S ALL

61
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:34,853
KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAVE NEVER

62
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:37,122
BEEN ADDRESSED TO A CIVIL RIGHTS

63
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:37,556
ORGANIZATION.

64
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,858
CERTAINLY NOT SINCE THE 1950s,

65
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:43,195
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS B

66
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:46,631
BDS MOVEMENT THAT'S UNDER WAY.

67
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:47,899
BOYCOTT, DIVEST AND ESSENTIALLY.

68
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,969
AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL

69
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,370
MOVEMENT VERY WELL ORCHESTRATED.

70
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,507
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS KINDS OF

71
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:58,810
THINGS LIKE IN THE MILITARY.

72
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,212
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE, AIMED AT

73
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:01,980
THE MEMBERS OF BOARD, THE

74
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,948
MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION AS A

75
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,450
WHOLE, AND IT'S THE PROP BEGAN

76
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,052
DA THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE

77
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:07,719
ICEBERG.

78
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,387
THE REST IS TRUE.

79
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:10,989
YOU CAN'T CALL IN THE FALSE

80
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:11,990
POLICE REPORT WITHOUT BREAKING

81
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,524
THE LAW.

82
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:13,592
THEY'VE DONE IT.

83
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,894
YOU CAN'T GO AFTER PEOPLE'S

84
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:17,028
PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS BY

85
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,330
HACKING INTO THEM IT'S AGAINST

86
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,030
THE LAW.

87
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,565
YOU CAN'T CALL PEOPLE UP IN THE

88
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:22,167
MIDDLE OF NIGHT AND THREATEN

89
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,435
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW, AND

90
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,803
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY WITH THAT.

91
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:26,905
>> YOU'RE NOT SAYING THE KIDS.

92
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:30,041
>> NO, THIS IS -- THIS THING WAS

93
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,043
ORGANIZED VERY WELL IN ADVANCE.

94
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,645
PARKLAND WAS SIMPLY THE NEXT

95
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:34,646
EVENT THAT HAPPENED IT COULD

96
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:35,614
HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE.

97
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,882
COULD HAVE BEEN THE EVENT THAT

98
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:37,716
HAPPENED IN THE SCHOOL IN

99
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:38,483
CALIFORNIA TODAY.

100
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:39,651
WHAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR WAS

101
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,553
ONE OF THESE EVENTS, AND WHOEVER

102
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,355
IS ORCHESTRATING IT HAS DONE AN

103
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:44,890
EFFECTIVE JOB.

104
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,391
IT HASN'T THIS INTENDED

105
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:47,359
CONSEQUENCES, HOWEVER.

106
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,427
THE NRA TODAY HAS NEARLY

107
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:50,295
6 MILLION MEMBERS.

108
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,365
WE'VE BEEN AROUND SINCE 1780 --

109
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:54,699
EXCUSE ME 1871.

110
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,134
IT'S LATE.

111
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:56,701
1871.

112
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,636
OLDEST CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION

113
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,670
IN AMERICA.

114
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,439
IT'S HERE TO TEACH MARKSMANSHIP.

115
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,341
SAFE HANDLING OF WEAPONS.

116
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,076
WE GO ON RANGES AND TRAINING FOR

117
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:07,312
LAW ENFORCEMENT, FOR MILITARY

118
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:07,812
GUYS.

119
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,415
IT'S BEEN DONE FOR LITERALLY

120
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,249
SINCE 1871.

121
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,251
>> SO I KNOW THAT THE ESTIMATES

122
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:14,920
ARE THERE ARE MORE THAN

123
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,221
100 MILLION AMERICAS WHO OWN

124
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:16,521
GUNS.

125
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:17,889
SO ONLY 6 MILLION IN THE NRA,

126
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,859
YOUR JOB IS NOW TO TRY TO BOOST

127
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:21,726
MEMBERSHIPS MIPS.

128
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:23,261
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE

129
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:27,065
CHOSEN NOT TO PARTAKE?

130
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:28,266
>> I DON'T KNOW.

131
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,535
WE'VE HAD SEVERAL MARINES AT THE

132
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:30,835
HEAD.

133
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,505
THE LAST ONE WAS JOE FLOSS,

134
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,839
MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT AND

135
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,875
HE'S THE GUY THAT BROUGHT ME IN.

136
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,977
SO HE USED HIS -- THIS IS A

137
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:39,978
LEGENDARY FIGURE.

138
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:41,980
I'M CERTAINLY NO JOE FLOSS.

139
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,682
BUT I KNOW MARINES AND I KNOW

140
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,617
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND AIRMEN

141
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:47,218
FOR 17 YEARS, THAT'S ALL I DID

142
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:49,120
FOR US HERE AT FOX NEWS.

143
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,958
THERE ARE 23 MILLION ACTIVE DUTY

00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,259
RETIRED AND RESERVE AND THEIR

145
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,460
FAMILIES.

146
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,128
AND I KNOW HOW TO REACH THEM.

147
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:59,764
WE DID 100 PLUS HOURS OF WAR

148
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:00,365
STORIES.

149
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,866
AND I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND

150
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,234
ENCOURAGE THEM, IN FACT, HERE IT

151
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:07,272
IS, JOIN NRA.ORG I'M GOING TO

THAT'S GOING TO HELP SCHOOL

00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,980
SHIELD, PROGRAM THAT WE STARTED

157
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,113
WELL BEFORE PARKLAND.

158
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:17,749
IF THEY HAD HAD SCHOOL SHIELD

159
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:19,384
PROGRAM IN THAT SCHOOL, IT'S

160
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,885
VERY UNLIKELY THAT THAT YOUNG

161
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,054
MAN COULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO THAT

162
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,257
SCHOOL WITH A FIRE APPLE

163
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:26,291

SCHOOL WITH A FIREARM.LE

166
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:29,361
WHAT THEY'RE ASKING IS THIS

PLEASE.

170
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,835
A HUNDRED MILLION MEN'S WITH

171
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,570
FIREARMS GOING TO TAKE THEM

172
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,270
AWAY?

173
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,905
A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RETIRED

174
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,173
SUGGESTS THAT WE TO THE REPEAL

175
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:43,508

176
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:45,477

00:04:51,716 --> 00:00:00,000
OF THESE KIDS?
