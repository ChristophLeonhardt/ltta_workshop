there's an old saying that goes you can't fight city hall that chestnut basically implies that it's almost impossible to go up against a faceless bureaucratic process when taking on government but what if your fight against City Hall entails an elected representative with a not so hidden agenda someone that is going to use and potentially abuse their power to prevent citizens from getting their way well just wait till you hear this story about our Richmond Hill counselor who was employing everything from falsehoods to intimidation tactics to shut down musical acts Richmond Hill resident Stephie good field is a big music aficionado and she's taken upon herself to bolster what was once a non-existent music culture in Canada's largest town she set up an organization called York Region open mic which books musicians and bands at local pubs anyone in the audience who wants to take part as a band member for a song or two is welcome to do so and this labor of love on her part has proven enormous ly successful but not everyone is happy in Richmond Hill councillor Karen Sullivan's has sent good field emails and voicemails demanding any reference to Ward 5 be removed from the posters and Facebook information Ward 5 is not only the location of the open mic event it is also one of the names of the Bands Ward 5 Jam now according to one email sent by celibates good field and one of the Ward 5 jam musicians Matt Bergman did quote not have Sullivan's authority as the ward 5 councillor nor the authority of the town of Richmond Hill to use that identification in any of their promotional and/or informational material /e material end quote councillor Sullivan's also left a threatening voicemail for good field of bergman check it out that he's going to be naming your Sunday night music event at Archibald's the ward 5 Music Jam or Music Fest what everything's going to be calling it please be advised there nobody at Richmond Hill councilors used the term Ward in any event unless you are a counselor if you met bergman and you because you are York Region open mic and this is under your name if you in way name your event which does not have my sponsorship or my authority as the ward 5 Music Jam and Archibald on Sunday night I will take legal action against both of you and your company this is not a joke I am away for the weekend in Collingwood with Derrick I don't need this kind of aggravation I don't need it from the likes of networking and I certainly don't need it from the likes of you I don't know what it is that I've ever done to you or ever done to make Gucci so you can let him listen to this if he doesn't have the balls to call me back but do you advise Fifi that if you in any way toy from that government in any way of course your Sunday night German Archibald's the Ward 5 event there is going to be serious problems that you are both gonna have to deal with illegally know that he died for us it is just not done only councilors who are elected towards use their terminology I would appreciate it if you call me back or you send me a text and you assure me that this has been taken care of by you is Yerevan thank you well councillor celibate seems to claim that Ward 5 is a registered trademark for the town the truth is that it is not proprietary language it is generic the town itself says so Ward 5 is akin to the airport designator code for Toronto why why Zed or the area code for Toronto four one six good field in Bergman have filed a complaint with the city's integrity commissioner but they are still baffled why a city councillor would want to shut down the event I mean I can only assume I don't know why else that would have been such a big deal first of all to have more music in the community I don't know why that's a bad thing and to use the word Ward 5 it was it's in Ward 5 so it was baffling why it was such a big deal and I I was a sponsor I I didn't start the open mic and even if I had I was just being bombarded by stop using this language and you better take it down now and immediately and call me back and I didn't respond like it just seemed to make no sense and musician Matt Bergman while he's also baffled by the threats on what is supposed to be a fun community event I mean what we do is good clean fun and we you know we invite the community out and we've helped a lot of people get better at playing music and you know people make friends they start bands like it's a community event and we're trying to promote you know friendship and positivity and all that kind of stuff and this is the unfortunate thing that has happened to kind of try and taint our positive environment that we create so yeah it's unfortunate I never thought I'd have to deal with this but here we are so it should be noted good field has been diagnosed with stage four cancer and despite being aware of this councillor Sullivan's has not backed down I mean who knows when things happen when I was around the time that I did have some new tumors and ended up with radiation I'm not saying that's because of the stress but certainly didn't help it and it was it was an unnecessary part of of any of this it was really unnecessary now there are two sides to every story of course so we reached out to councilor celibate she initially agreed to an interview we let her pick the day the time and the venue but just hours before the interview she abruptly cancelled not to worry the very next day the counselor was at a local park taking part in a community cleanup event so we dropped by before the event to try and get some answers oh hi Karen fancy meeting you here David Menzies I'm sorry you couldn't make our meeting yesterday no I won't be interviewed by you you got my statement according to Steffi good field and Mark Bergman they seem to think that because your partner is a musician that you are sort of on a vendetta against them bringing in other musical acts is that true hardly but as I said I will not be interviewed on camera and I certainly won't be ambushed at an event I'm holding here in this park for my for my residence I will not be interviewed by you your rebel media I know exactly what you guys do and I will not be interviewed what do we do I will not be you do this you ambush people I will not be well I wouldn't be here if you had fulfilled your promise to meet me for an interview yesterday I promise I said I would meet you there was a promise involved and I am absolutely permitted to change my mind fancy meeting you here in the park now good field says she thinks councillor Sullivan's has employed the bylaw department to ticket vehicles at venues where the Ward 5 Jam plays and one pub was told to remove a sign advertising the band even though the signage had been in place for about a year I asked celibates if this was indeed true did you employ the use of by law to have parking tickets issued at venues or to have a pub remove a sign I will very simple question councillor Sullivan's did you in fill of it I apologize I will not answer any more question it's a very simple question did you and did you employ by law to issue tickets because as that would be why don't you get in touch with by law in any fashion regarding these musicians regarding these musicians okay that is even more absurd and and ridiculous as your previous as your previous accusation simple yes or no a question that Karen as I said to you I will not respond to these questions so you can't even say because if you have used by law the answer is no but there's no absolutely 100% because if it is yes wouldn't that be abuse of authority I have never done that well the answer is no why did it take so long to get a straight answer from her I'll let you be the judge on that one and where does the town stand on this dispute well Cindy van Brussels tried to raise the issue at a town council meeting recently during a time set aside for the public to make submissions specifically she wanted to get the mayor and other councillors to weigh in on that over top voicemail Sullivan sent to good field but check it out she was literally shut down hey far be it for me to give this honorable counselor any sort of political advice especially since I'm sure she's aware that 2018 is an election year and as always in a democracy it will be the people who will have the final say for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
