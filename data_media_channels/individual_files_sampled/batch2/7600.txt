when you become a TYT member not only do you get exclusive content you become a part of our family click the link in the description box below to join the home of progressives it just broke just recently actually but megyn kelly is apparently out as the host of NBC's Today Show there had been sort of rumors going around she was not going to be appearing for the rest of this week but she is now formally out she also has dropped her talent agency and gotten a new lawyer all of us coming in the wake of her comments about Halloween and blackface coming earlier this week so although it's interesting from my point of view megyn kelly has always been extremely questionable on topics like this so i don't know why everybody so shocked all of a sudden but what she said was awful and they apparently are taking it seriously yeah I mean I thought what she said was obviously I have it I mean it was so stupid that I didn't think it rose to the level of awful because it wasn't you know was it a particular thing that she did she didn't do it right she was just saying I what I was against five because I never bothered to think outside the limited scope of my world I never yeah because I have no empathy I never thought about anybody else there were so many things that she had said that that suggested I thought that her hiring at NBC News was a terrible one and wouldn't work also if he just from a business point of view she appealed to that audience it's a very good broadcaster she a very good broadcaster she is given so I don't know what she would yeah her belief system seems a little messed up but if she's I imagine she'll go back to Fox and she'll probably do well I don't know that there's anyone else who will hire her NBC also news may also made the decision to get rid of a pretty popular last hour of the morning show with Hoda copy and and Kathie Lee Gifford and and replace it with megyn kelly today super very awkward for the next host of megyn kelly today or maybe those hire another megyn kelly if they thought they could find one but um uh so I don't know I just find it it surprises me that this is the thing that got her it's so surprising to me that I think that that the ratings were bad to make it 20 so I think my guess is it's just a guess that she's done anyway like they were go like that they were figured out maybe was gonna happen to the first of the year over the holidays something and now this happened and they're like hey what do we let's just let's get this going down they're gonna have to pay her a tremendous because that just didn't seem fireable to me and her apology her apology was was it was actually pretty good yeah yeah the thing is their apology as far as it's different than most because apologies always get bungled somehow I was I'm always confused as how someone's apology goes I can't believe you'd say that to me you should be sorry but so from that aspect she was saying she didn't know and we talked about in the shawl wasn't here but we talked about how this is based on ignorance smegging just didn't know megyn kelly is going on 48 years old I'm sorry to give her age but everyone knows it's easily searchable um I'm 38 years old I've heard of it how could you not know hey hey if you didn't grow up in the time of minstrel shows in blackface and understanding what it was your favorite celebrity since 1990 had been getting in trouble for minstrel blackface appearances at Halloween so it's not new it's not a you know I didn't know about this whole Halloween remember the orange is the new black costume that the dancer from Dancing with the Stars that I think it was her one of them did it and she darkened her face and she caught hell for it and uh and then she goes oh man I didn't know so move aside and say oh you didn't know but then I think the icing on the back of this whole conversation that megan kelly had on that show was it's just so hard to keep up with the pc nature like us normal people have to keep getting offensive that's right who's the abnormal people you're the normal person who doesn't know the history of blackface and the effectiveness and had on people in the country from as far back as any kind of entertainment that we've had and and the way that it portrayed black folks and a lot of people to have these perceptions of them that went on to murder them on a mass scale you don't know about the background of anything of that if you don't be quiet and wait and learn instead after she caught backlash then she says you know what I need it too maybe it's time for me to start listening you should start listening a long time ago back when you told that fourteen-year-old black girl was getting beat up by police in Texas hey maybe she shouldn't been doing that to Santa Claus and Jonas were why he's no angel so yes she's not she was no angel how do you know but but okay so I don't want to make any you can't make full assessments on someone's potential discriminatory basis is off of a few things that they've said but there's been several um and she's not dumb as you said no she knows you can you so I guess my problem the apology was that I'm just I'm just read a million things but somehow I missed the black face memo did you miss that and compared it to black people doing white face that was the same movie if you ever do that I'm gonna get very fit because that's always offended me to my core when black people do white face that's just that that's been going that's been going on too long in America and we got to put a stop to it hangry yeah I'm largely in the same position as you I feel like I mean considering the amount they were paying her I don't think that they would have fired her based purely off of that comment you know and obviously I mean many people find incredibly offensive people can defer on that certainly her presentation of the topic seemed to be aggressively ignorant about that topic it was like I don't want to hear it from anybody who's gonna tell me that this isn't that this is offensive you know what what I like Diana Ross hey there's a float runner I talked about this one it's a floral you guys can find out Nina anywhere ask the question should I dress in blackface Halloween all signs point to no you go no but I actually like the character I'm dressing up as that sign points to no no I'm not actually a racist that sign still points to know you're gonna have a fabulous time at your Halloween party if you dress up as Diana Ross if you dress up as Stevie Wonder and you don't darken you can I just as we go out I just don't get that as we're nearing Halloween you know you know you never better but my ex-wife was black right and I wanted to go Halloween every year we never dressed up but I wanted to go as Ike and Tina Turner but she would go as Tina Turner and I would go as Dwight Eisenhower and we would tell everybody where I can Taylor Turner and I thought come on that's so good last thing I was saying this to those who freaked out about concern about blackface I just think it's weird that they're honestly people who get more offended at being told they can't do blackface they think it's more reasonable to be mad about that than to be mad about the blackface in the first place you could literally go as any costume as you want basically and because you can't do this one particular thing you get pissed off about that I will never understand that last thing in the plug year show Wednesday on on the damage report with John we also did this ad that was down in Florida by and obviously a white supremacist racist group I mean put all the the robocall the ruble calls about a with Andrew Gilliam it's exactly what a minstrel show would be so it's 2018 but it's still happening and when you hear that robo call and you compare it to what what these minstrel shows were that were done in blackface it's not like you could miss it it's not over it once it didn't stop in 1902 it's still happening and it's purposeful to make people go you know what I hate that inward guy on the go don't worry we got you covered you still listen to TYT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at
