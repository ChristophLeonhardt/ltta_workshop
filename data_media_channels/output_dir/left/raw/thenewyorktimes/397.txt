1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,820
The environment outside the habitat 
is very barren.

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:18,430
There's very little vegetation, very 
little in the way of life, really.

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,060
It doesn't offer the sensory variety that 
the world back home offers.

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,300
You don't have traffic. You don't have
the sounds of other people.

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,270
You’re just here and that's it.

6
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,449
Putting the VR on, having been in here
for five months, is strange.

7
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,850
It's so overwhelming to have 
that much sensory input

8
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,630
that you haven’t had for five months.

9
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,809
As soon as you put the VR headset on, 
you kind of really get sucked into

10
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:42,709
this kind of different world and forget 
that you’re in a dome

11
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:45,359
on the side of a volcano.

12
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,190
It is sometimes easy to forget 
where you actually are

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,720
and that's a really interesting feeling
to sort of be nowhere.

14
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,440
It's just you there.

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,269
Maybe you're sitting alone in a forest.

16
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,169
Or maybe you're sitting 
alone in a city park.

17
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:14,599
You don't have to think about 
the five other people

18
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,289
that you're in the habitat with, and you 
don't have to hear them or see them.

19
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,659
You really get a chance to feel like 
you're alone. It's just yours.

20
00:02:23,830 --> 00:00:00,000
And that feeling is pretty rare because, 
in here, you’re never truly alone.
