Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT." LAST YEAR CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS YOU REMEMBER PAST A MAJOR TAX REFORM BILL. IT ACCOMPLISHED A BIG GOAL FOR THEM AND MANY OF THEIR DONORS. A TAX REFORM WASN'T WHAT REPUBLICANS RAN ON IN 2016. POPULAR AS IT MAY BE NOW. AT THE TIME THEY RAN YOU WILL REMEMBER ON IMMIGRATION AND A PROMISE TO TREAT AMERICA'S BORDERS LIKE THEY ARE ACTUAL BORDERS AND MATTER, LIKE THIS WAS A REAL COUNTRY. SOME REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS THINK CONGRESS WANT TO BETRAY THAT PLEDGE IN THE MOST DRAMATIC POSSIBLE WAY. THEY'RE WORKING TONIGHT TO PASS A SO-CALLED DISCHARGE PETITION IN THE HOUSE. IT WOULD FORCE BOATS ON A SLEW OF IMMIGRATION MATTERS, INCLUDING SOME THAT WOULD GIVE AMNESTY TO MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. HOW MANY? WE CAN'T SAY BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH ON THE NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT IT TURNS OUT THAT NOBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WHEN WHEN WE SAY IT NOBODY KNOWS, WE MEAN NOBODY KNOWS TO WITHIN LIKE 10 MILLION. THE ESTIMATE YOU HERE FOR ALMOST EVERYONE IS 11 MILLION. 11 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT NUMBER COMES FROM PEW. IT HASN'T CHANGED IN A DECADE AND THAT SHOULD BE A TIP-OFF BECAUSE OVER THE LAST DECADE ILLEGAL ARRIVALS HAVE CONTINUED AND NOW STATES ARE ACTIVELY SABOTAGING DEPORTATION EFFORTS. THE REAL FIGURE IT TURNS OUT IS MUCH, MUCH HIGHER. ICE DIRECTOR ADMITTED THAT MUCH LAST YEAR. WE KNOW 11 MILLION IS NOT CORRECT. SO WHAT'S THE REAL NUMBER? AN UNPUBLISHED PAPER BY GALE, THREE PROFESSORS THEIR ESTIMATES THERE COULD BE 23 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THEIR LOW-END ESTIMATE IS 17 MILLION. EVEN BACK IN 2005, THE REAL NUMBER WAS PROBABLY 20 MILLION OR MORE. AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY ARE HERE BUT SOME MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO GIVE AMNESTY TO SOME OF THEM, OR MAYBE ALL OF THEM. IT'S NOT WITH THE VOTERS WANTED, BUT THEY APPARENTLY DON'T CARE. CONGRESSMAN JEFF DENHAM IS A REPUBLICAN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT. THANKS FOR COMING OUT. THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK AGAIN. Tucker: SHOULDN'T WE FIGURE OUT HOW MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE WE ENCOURAGE MORE TO COME? WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS ACTUALLY SECURE OUR BORDER AND THE ONLY WAY WE WILL GET THE BORDER SECURED IS ACTUALLY WORKING TOGETHER TO PASS SOMETHING OFF THE FLOOR. THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO TALK ABOUT 25 MILLION AND SECURE BORDER MAKING SURE THESE CARAVANS AREN'T COMING ACROSS, THE CATCH AND RELEASE PROGRAM. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE ACTUALLY BRING UP A DEBATE AND ACTUALLY PUT SOMETHING ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK. Tucker: WAIT A SECOND. GIVING AMNESTY TO PEOPLE ENCOURAGES MORE PEOPLE TO COME HERE ILLEGALLY. IT WAS TRIED IN 1986 AND THAT WAS ITS EFFECT. IT'S THE EFFECT EVERY SINGLE TIME. BEFORE WE GET MORE PEOPLE COMING ACROSS AN BORDER SECURITY NOBODY TAKES SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A JOKE, WHY SHOULDN'T WE KNOW HOW MANY ARE HERE AND WHY DOESN'T CONGRESS DETERMINED TO FIND OUT HOW MANY ARE HERE? IT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF A BASELINE ISSUE. RATHER THAN JUST DOING A CENSUS TO FIGURE HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE, WHY DON'T WE STOP THEM FROM COMING HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? DOING NOTHING MEANS ANOTHER 500,000 PEOPLE WILL CROSS OUR BORDER EVERY SINGLE YEAR. I'VE BEEN IN THE MAJORITY NOW FOR EIGHT YEARS. THAT'S 4 MILLION PEOPLE. SHOULDN'T WE STOP RIGHT NOW AND ACTUALLY DO WITH THE PRESIDENT IS ASKING US FOR? EVEN SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATS HAD PROPOSED A FEW YEARS AGO AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE FUNDING, BUILD THE BORDER SECURITY, DO THE SURVEILLANCE, MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GUARANTEE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT WE'VE STOPPED THIS INFLUX ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. Tucker: HOW ABOUT THIS, WOULD YOU SUPPORT PUNISHING ANY EMPLOYER CAUGHT EMPLOYING AN ILLEGAL ALIEN? REALLY PUNISHING THEM. CHECKING EVERY EMPLOYEE IN AMERICA AND MAKING SURE THAT NOBODY IS EMPLOYING ILLEGAL ALIENS IN LIEU OF AMERICAN WORKERS. WHY NOT DO THAT STARTING, I DON'T KNOW, TOMORROW? AS YOU KNOW, AND A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, ESPECIALLY A NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THAT NEEDS TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T START TOMORROW. I DO SUPPORT E-VERIFY. I DO SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE Tucker: UNIVERSAL E-VERIFY? ABSOLUTELY. BUT WE HAVE TO FIX THE REST OF OUR IMMIGRATION PROCESS FIRST. REPUBLICANS HAVE SET FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW WE WILL NOT PASS A COMPREHENSIVE BILL, BUT YET THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT'S B THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT'S I THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT'S G PROPOSED TODAY. THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT DEALING WITH BORDER SECURITY, DEALING WITH OUR DREAMERS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION AFTER FOLLOWING THEIR GOVERNMENT AND SIGNING UP FOR DACA. WE NEED TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE. Tucker: FOLLOWING OUR GOVERNMENT? WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME HERE ILLEGALLY WITH THEIR PARENTS? NO. IF WE HAD A PRESIDENT THAT PASSED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH I DISAGREED WITH, BUT NEVERTHELESS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PASSED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ALLOWED DACA RECIPIENTS TO STEP FORWARD. THESE KIDS WHO HAVE GRADUATED FROM OUR HIGH SCHOOLS, WHO HAVE GROWN UP IN THIS COUNTRY, WHO KNOW OF NO OTHER COUNTRY OR NO OTHER HOME, THEY'VE DONE WITH THEIR COUNTRY HAS ASKED THEM TO DO AND THEY'VE SIGNED UP FOR THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER UNDER DACA. Tucker: THEY ARE NOT CITIZENS. OKAY. LET'S JUST BACK UP. THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR DECADES THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR DECADE DECADES. Tucker: RIGHT. I'M JUST SAYING IN A WORLD WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF PRIORITIES, WHY IS THIS YOUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY? IN YOUR STATE YOU GOT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE LIVING ON THE SIDEWALK, THOSE ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS. WHY DON'T YOU DEAL WITH A PROBLEM LIKE THAT FIRST BEFORE YOU START PASSING OUT CITIZENSHIP TO PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE KIND OF AN ARGUMENT THAT I GET FROM SOME OF THE LIBERAL NETWORKS, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A PRIORITY OR THIS PRIORITY? I BELIEVE ON ADDRESSING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES AT THE SAME TIME. Tucker: LOOK, GIVING CITIZENSHIP AND VOTING RIGHTS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY IS NOT A WAY OF SECURING OUR BORDER, SO WHY WOULDN'T YOU SECURE THE BORDER FIRST? WE HAVE TWO ISSUES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED FOR, INCLUDING HIS FOUR PILLARS, BUT THE MAIN THING HE CONTINUES TO TALK ABOUT, THE PRESIDENT ASKS FOR A SOLUTION ON DACA AND FOR BORDER SECURITY. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GIVE HIM BOTH. Tucker: OKAY. LET'S LEAVE THE PRESIDENT OUT OF THIS. IT JUST AS SOMEONE WHO IS HIRED TO REPRESENT AMERICAN CITIZENS, SPEAK SLOWLY SO I CAN UNDERSTAND, WHY WOULD WE GIVE CITIZENSHIP TO ANYBODY HERE ILLEGALLY, GIVE VOTING RIGHTS TO ANYONE WHOSE FAMILY CAME HERE ILLEGALLY BEFORE NOT A SINGLE NEW PERSON CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY? UNTIL YOU CAN LOOK YOUR VOTERS IN THE FACE AND SAY OUR BORDER IS SECURE, NOW WE CAN MAYBE GIVE CITIZENSHIP TO ILLEGALS. THAT DYNAMIC CHANGED UNDER THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT. FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T BELIEVE IN GIVING ANYBODY ANYTHING. THIS WILL BE AN EARNED PATHWAY. BY ALL OF THE DIFFERENT BILLS IT WOULD BE AT LEAST A 10-12 YEAR PROCESS. FIRST SIGNED UP FOR FIVE YEARS OF A TEMPORARY GREEN CARD THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL OR SIGN UP FOR THE MILITARY AND AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS, AFTER YOU PASS THE BACKGROUND CHECK, YOU HAVE PAID YOUR FINE AND YOUR FEE, YOU'VE ACTUALLY PROVEN THAT YOU ARE NOT ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND YOU ARE OUT THERE WORKING OR GOING TO SCHOOL OR SERVING YOUR COUNTRY AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS. Tucker: NONE OF THAT'S REAL. WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IS ANOTHER FIVE YEARS, DOING IT ALL OVER AGAIN, SO IT'S A 12 YEAR PROCESS, TEN YEARS BEFORE HE WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET A LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENT CARD. Tucker: MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WANT TO COME HERE. WHY WOULD YOU GIVE A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY AHEAD OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING IN LINE, OBEYING OUR LAWS? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M CONFUSED I GUESS. IT'S A 12 YEAR PROCESS AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS EARNED PATHWAY BELIEVE THAT THIS EARNED PATHWA PATHWAY, THIS EARNED 12 YEAR PROCESS WOULD PUT YOU AT THE BACK OF THE LINE BUT CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN HERE, WHO'S GRADUATED FROM OUR SCHOOLS THAT HAS BEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT HAS FOLLOWED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER UNDER OBAMA SHOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. Tucker: OKAY I GUESS. I DON'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY JUST TO SIT BACK AND WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Tucker: AS A CONGRESSMAN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA YOU GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS. CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS. YES. Tucker: YEAH, YOU DO. SO LIKE WHY WOULD THIS BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE TOP OF YOUR PRIORITY LIST? I'M JUST COMPLETELY CONFUSED. THESE ARE NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS. TENS OF MILLIONS OF HURTING AMERICAN CITIZENS IN YOUR PUTTING THESE PEOPLE HAD OF THEM AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. YOU ARE ELECTED TO LEAD AND WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ON THE PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED ON BORDER SECURITY. THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE RULES OF THIS HOUSE AND THE SENATE, YOU'VE GOT TO GET 60 VOTES. THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL GET THE 60 MEMBERS ON A BIPARTISAN BORDER SECURITY BILL IS WITH A SOLUTION THAT IS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT
