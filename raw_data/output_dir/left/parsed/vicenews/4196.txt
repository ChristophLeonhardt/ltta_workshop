I remember reading about this place
any paper that hired older people and
that they worked with stainless steel so
I came down here I looked around at the
place is that high this is interesting
fortunately at that time he was hiring
two people
I gave him my resume
mine going having fun
vitae needle has a mix of Ages here we
have younger people who are full-time
and older people from about in the 60s
on up to 99 and they're all part-time
the only requirement is to be able to
walk up and down the stairs and you can
be helped up and helped down that's okay
to the guys we used to help Rosa down
the stairs but she was a hundred years
old
people don't much talk about retirement
here occasionally we talk about dying I
have no idea how to sell stuff online
you know who does know Bob downstairs
supplies for change
Oh
I work quietly at my desk in fact I do
that most of the time if you would have
described how at his desk he would be
working twice working gives me a place
to go
structured in my life adds social
connection
thanks Mike some people when I tell them
I'm still working and I'm 83 this
surprise and I tell him I'm doing it
because I need the money and that
usually keeps him pretty quiet
my wife had started a catering business
we cater out of our house we didn't
expect her to get sick the business to
fail and I didn't expect her to die all
in the tight period of time you guys
Monday back at the same old shop
I won't work invited needle and they
will come by one day and think that I'm
asleep of my bench and all be dead
that's what I propose and they'll say
how would bring what dedication
you
