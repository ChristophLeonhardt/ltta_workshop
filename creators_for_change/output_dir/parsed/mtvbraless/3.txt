Today's episode Decoded has nothing
to do with race, gender, or ethnicity,
but, fellow able-bodied folks,
don't get too excited 'cause
we need to tighten up.
(lively, upbeat music)
As a woman of color, there are a lot
of phrases I'm tired of hearing.
In fact, I made a whole video about them.
Oh, cute for a black guy.
That one kinda looks like you.
But microaggressions like these
aren't just limited to race.
So on today's episode of Decoded,
we're talking about five
things people living
with disabilities are tired of hearing,
reading, and seeing from
us able-bodied folks.
And here to help us out is Danielle Perez.
- Thanks, Franchesca.
As an amputee, I can't speak
for every physically disabled person,
but across the spectrum
of physical disability,
there are some things we have in common.
And while this list of phrases could be,
like, 200 points long,
we've done you a favor
and trimmed it down to five.
Number one, how do you have sex?
People across the spectrum
of disability do indeed date.
We have romantic feelings,
romantic partners,
and yes, we (bleep).
The idea that sex must
be inherently painful,
sad, or shameful for disabled people
is an ill-informed stereotype
and one that assumes able-bodied people
are the only people whose
bodies can be desirable.
I'm fine as (bleep), and if you
can't see it, that's on you.
This stereotype tends to
disproportionately impact
physically disabled
folks, especially folks
who regularly use mobility
aids or wheelchairs like me!
And unless you're trying to
smash, mind your own business.
Number two, you don't look disabled!
Oh my God, this phrase is a hot mess.
Some people try to use this
phrase as a compliment.
It's not.
Don't erase our disability just
because it makes you feel better.
I've actually had people
tell me I'm too pretty
to be in a wheelchair.
Rude, I'm pretty and use a wheelchair.
It's important to remember the intent
doesn't always equal impact, which means
that even the best of intentions
can result in able-bodied people
speaking down to disabled folks.
Other people use you don't look disabled
as an accusation, which
what in the actual (bleep)?
Too often, able-bodied people assume
that disabilities you can't see are,
by nature, less serious
or entirely illegitimate.
Not every disability is visible.
Some people live with
invisible disabilities,
which includes people who
are deaf or hard of hearing,
and people living with chronic illnesses
that cause pain or fatigue.
But even people with physical disabilities
might not need mobile aids consistently.
Seeing someone in a wheelchair
stand up or use their legs
does not mean they
don't need a wheelchair.
Seeing someone with a
cane walking without it
doesn't mean they're
faking or exaggerating.
Y'all really think disabled people
aren't actually disabled and instead
are putting up their own
Showtime character special?
(buzzer buzzes)
We shouldn't have to prove we're disabled
in the first place, yet
we're constantly asked to,
which is why the phrase
you don't look disabled
has a particular sting to it.
Number three, I know someone
with your disability,
and something that helped them was...
People get heated when we
generalize about millennials.
We all will still assume every person
with a particular
disability will be helped
by this same exact thing.
Disability is not a monolith,
and it's not experienced
by every person in the same way.
So just 'cause your cousin
was helped by doing yoga
doesn't mean that's
helpful information for me.
You and your cousin are not my doctor,
unless it's Shelly, hey girl!
I don't mind talking about your friend
or neighbor who also
lives with X disability,
but don't assume that means
their lived experience
is similar to mine.
But also, I would much rather talk
about Cardi B coming for
Nicki Minaj's whole life
at New York Fashion Week.
'Kay, Team Cardi forever.
Number four, I was there
was a cure for you.
Not every disabled person
needs or wants to be cured.
We're people, not salami.
This mentality assumes
disability is a burden
and places the onus on disabled
people to fix themselves
rather than considering the ways we
as a society could make
our world more inclusive.
Our systems of education,
our infrastructure,
and our media are all catered
to serve the same types
of brains and bodies.
(buzzer buzzing)
When we focus on curing
rather than including,
it implies you'd rather change people
rather than infrastructure.
Inclusive design benefits everyone.
Do you really find it
threatening to live in a world
with more elevators and sidewalk cutouts?
Both of those things are
super useful to everyone.
Number five, I'm so sorry.
Disabled people are
people, and as YouTuber,
intersectional activist, and
my friend Annie Segarra writes,
"One does not need to be able-bodied
"or healthy in order to be happy.
"We can be sick or disabled and happy,
"and sad sometimes, just like you."
Yes, believe it or not, disabled people
also experience a range of emotions.
It's almost like we're human?
And fun fact, disabled people
are the largest minority
population in the US.
According to the US Census,
40 million Americans live
with a disability; it's normal.
So don't be sorry just because
someone has a disability.
Treat them like you would
any able-bodied friend
and save your sympathy for
when their goldfish dies
or they go viral on
Twitter for a bad take.
It happens to the best of us.
Anyway, I promise I'd limit
myself to five, and here we are.
Hopefully, we can get
an hour-long followup
for my backup list of
phrases I'm tired of hearing.
Kickin' it back to you, Franchesca.
- Thanks, Danielle.
And look, the truth is if
you've said any of these things
in the past, that doesn't
make you a terrible person.
We all make mistakes.
But now that you know
better, you can do better.
Problem solved.
And before we go, I just
wanna give a big thanks
to Danielle Perez.
And, as always, thanks for watching.
We'll see you next time
right here on Decoded.
(lively, upbeat music)
- I'm fine as (bleep).
I know I look good.
I'm all that and a bag of chips.
Are we still saying that,
does anyone have chips?
I'm sexy as hell.
I'm a dime on wheels,
okay, we call it a quarter.
I'm a catch, and I know
because I'm on wheels
you don't think so, but
I'm very hard to catch.
