1
00:00:00,582 --> 00:00:02,116
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND THAT

2
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:03,851
IS WHERE THEY REALLY, INNOCENCE,

3
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:07,054
SENSE, SAVE MY LIFE.

4
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:08,022
>> Martha: TONIGHT

5
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:08,722
GENERAL KEANE SHARES HIS OWN

6
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:10,824
UNTOLD STORY.

7
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:13,561
HE MADE SOME VERY CLOSE FOR

8
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:14,295
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS UP THERE

9
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:16,664
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT WE WERE

10
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:17,865
FIGHTING FOR.

11
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:18,933
THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR STORY

12
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:20,501
THAT IS SO POWERFUL FOR HIM THAT

13
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:22,870
HE HAS NOT TRADED PUBLICLY UNTIL

14
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,137
NOW.

15
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:26,807
>> I HAD TO DO AN ASSESSMENT FOR

16
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:27,942
GENERAL PETRAEUS FOR TWO YEARS

17
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:29,076
DURING THE IRAQI SURGE AND HE

18
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:31,045
ASKED ME TO DO MUCH THE SAME IN

19
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:32,413
AFGHANISTAN WHEN HE WAS ASSIGNED

20
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:32,746
THERE.

21
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:34,782
WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON

22
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:37,251
DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE

23
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:38,819
VISIT WAS TO UNITS THAT WERE

24
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,853
INVOLVED IN THE HEAVIEST

25
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:40,854
FIGHTING WE HAD EVER UNDERTAKEN

26
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,223
IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE THE

27
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:45,226
BEGINNING OF THE WAR.

28
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:48,062
THE MISSION OF THE PATROL WAS TO

29
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:50,264
TAKE ME AND LINK UP WITH THREE

30
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,199
TRIBAL CHIEFS, WHO HAD BEEN

31
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,767
HELPING THE AMERICANS EVER SINCE

32
00:00:53,768 --> 00:01:04,211
WE ARRIVED IN THE VALLEY.

33
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:04,878
AT SOME RISK TO THEMSELVES.

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,613
SO THEY PUT ME IN THE MIDDLE OF

35
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:06,280
PATROL, TOOK THE DOUBLE FILE

36
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:06,981
WALKING DOWN EACH SIDE OF THE

37
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,048
ROAD, A DIRT ROAD.

38
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:09,483
AND HE SAYS SIR, MAKE SURE YOU

39
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:10,584
PUT YOUR FOOT IN THE FOOTPRINT

40
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:12,052
OF THE SOLDIER IN FRONT OF YOU

41
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:13,887
BECAUSE JUST LAST WEEK WE LOST A

42
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,123
COUPLE OF SOLDIERS ON THIS VERY

43
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,458
ROAD DUE TO IED MINES.

44
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,526
SO OFF WE GO, A COUPLE OF MILES

45
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:21,862
AND WE HOOK UP WITH THE TRIBAL

46
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:24,498
CHIEFS IN THE MUD HUT WHICH IS

47
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:25,899
USED TO STORE HARVESTED GRAPES.

48
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,570
THIS IS A VALLEY FULL OF GRAPES

49
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:30,004
AND VINEYARDS.

WITH AK-47s AND THEY HAD PUT A

63
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:37,678
RUG DOWN.

64
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:40,481
I STARTED BY ASKING HIM, WHY?

65
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:42,082
WHY ARE YOU WILLING TO HELP THE

66
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:42,916
AMERICANS AND PUT YOURSELF SO

67
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,287
MUCH AT RISK TO DO SO?

68
00:01:46,288 --> 00:01:48,489
ONE CHIEF SPOKE AND HE SPOKE

69
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,823
THROUGHOUT THE SESSION.

70
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,693
HE SAID IT, SIR, IT'S ABOUT THE

71
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:54,561
FUTURE, ABOUT CHILDREN, AND THE

72
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:55,396
OTHERS NODDED.

73
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:57,831
HE SAID WE HAVE NO LIFE HERE

74
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,066
UNDER THE TALIBAN.

75
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,868
THE TALIBAN AND TELL US HOW TO

76
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,269
DRESS, HOW TO EAT, THEY TELL US

77
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,505
WHAT TO DO, THEY TELL US HOW TO

78
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:05,072
DO IT.

79
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:07,441
THEY BEAT US, THEY BEAT OUR

80
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,810
WOMEN, AND WE GET BLOWN UP BY

81
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,844
THE IEDs.

82
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,546
HE SAID, AMERICANS CAN HELP US

83
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,881
GET A FUTURE LIFE.

84
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:16,884
I TOOK ALL OF THAT IN AND I SAID

85
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:20,054
IT, CHIEFS, THE RISK IS REALLY

86
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:21,088
SIGNIFICANT.

87
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:21,622
TO ALL OF YOU.

88
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:25,059
AND HE CAME BACK AND HE SAID,

89
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,462
THEY ARE WATCHING US RIGHT NOW.

90
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,963
AND HE SAYS, WE KNOW WHAT THAT

91
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,432
RISK IS BUT IT'S OUR CHILDREN'S

92
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:34,868
FUTURE THAT WE CARE ABOUT.

93
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:37,271
AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING IT.

94
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:40,107
SO I SAID I JUST WANT TO

95
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:40,741
THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE

96
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:43,377
TROOPS THAT ARE HERE, ON BEHALF

97
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,578
OF GENERAL PRETORIUS, FOR THE

98
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,147
SACRIFICE THAT YOU ARE MAKING.

99
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:48,449
AND I SAID IT, IS THERE ANYTHING

100
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,652
THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU?

101
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:55,522
AND HE SAID, WELL, YES.

102
00:02:55,523 --> 00:03:00,094
WE NEED SCHOOLTEACHERS.

103
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,829
AND HE SAID, WE NEED A DIRT ROAD

104
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,064
TO GET TO THE PERIMETER ROAD TO

105
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:05,766
MAKE IT EASIER TO GET OUR GRAPES

106
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:07,267
OUT AND THEREFORE IT WILL HELP

107
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,470
US PRESERVE THEM.

108
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:11,271
I LOOKED AT THE BATTALION

109
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:12,406
COMMANDER AND THE BATTALION

110
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:14,108
COMMANDER HAD AN INTERPRETER AND

111
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,844
HE SAID, WHAT ABOUT IT?

112
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,480
AND HE SAID, IT'S IN THE SYSTEM.

113
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,648
I SAID CALL ME WHEREVER I AM.

114
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:25,853
I CAME BACK A FEW MONTHS LATER

115
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:27,087
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE

116
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:27,688
RESULTS WERE.

117
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,556
NOW NO FOOT PATROL, I'M DRIVING

118
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:32,659
ALONG THE ROWS OF THE VALLEY AND

119
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,129
THE TALIBAN I HAVE BEEN TOLD HAD

120
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,464
BEEN CLEARED OUT ENTIRELY.

121
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:38,766
ALONG THE ROADS THERE WERE

122
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,467
PEOPLE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE

123
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:41,769
STREETS, THERE WERE KIDS, I

124
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,903
STOPPED THE VEHICLE AND GOT OUT

125
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:45,005
OF THE VEHICLE AND I WAS TALKING

126
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:45,672
TO THE KIDS.

127
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:48,208
I HAD SEEN NO CHILDREN BEFORE,

128
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,109
NO VILLAGERS.

129
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,678
AND THEY ARE WAVING AT US,

130
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,479
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE AMERICAN

131
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,748
TROOPS COMING BY.

132
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:57,451
WE GET UP TO THE VILLAGE, AND

133
00:03:57,452 --> 00:03:58,218
THE BATTALION COMMANDER MEETS ME

134
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:01,655
AND HE SAYS, OKAY JOHN, I HAVE

135
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,257
TO PREPARE YOU FOR SOMETHING.

136
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:04,825
THE CHIEF THAT YOU ARE TALKING

137
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:09,463
TO, HE WAS KILLED ABOUT A WEEK

138
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:12,065
OR SO AFTER YOU LEFT, HE WAS

139
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:12,499
ASSASSINATED.

140
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,436
HE SAID ONE OF THE OTHER CHIEFS

141
00:04:15,437 --> 00:04:17,538
WAS BLOWN UP, AND HE LOST PART

142
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:18,272
OF HIS LEG.

143
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:20,240
HE WILL BE AT THE MEETING.

144
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:22,075
HE'S GOING TO DO THE TALKING.

145
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:24,478
SO I SAT DOWN ON THE RUG, NOW

146
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,747
THIS TIME IN THE VILLAGE, WITH

147
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:29,049
PEOPLE ALL AROUND, AND WE

148
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,284
ACKNOWLEDGED THE PASSING OF THE

149
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:32,286
CHIEF AND PRAISED HIM FOR HIS

150
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:33,654
BRAVERY, HIS COURAGE AND HIS

151
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,722
DETERMINATION TO BUILD A BETTER

152
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:39,259
LIFE FOR HIS PEOPLE.

153
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,662
AND, YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT

154
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:43,831
THE TALIBAN AND THEY SAID, YOU

155
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:51,705
KNOW, SIR, TODAY IS A BIG DAY.

156
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,208
SO I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN EGO

157
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,109
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I

158
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,277
WAS THERE.

159
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:59,480
AND I SAID, WHAT IS HAPPENING?

160
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,381
AND HE SAID SIR, THE TEACHER IS

161
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:01,815
COMING TODAY.

162
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:06,253
AND I SAID, OH, MY GOD, THAT'S

163
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:07,087
AMAZING.

164
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,856
HE SAID THAT WAS REAL PROGRESS.

165
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:12,059
SO I SAID, WHAT ABOUT THE ROAD?

166
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,294
DID YOU GET YOUR ROAD?

167
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:15,863
AND HE HELD UP TWO FINGERS.

168
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:16,530
I LOOKED AT THE BATTALION

169
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:18,098
COMMANDER AND HE SAID, WE OPENED

170
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:21,869
UP TO ROADS.

171
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,070
BUT I TELL THE STORY BECAUSE

172
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,272
IT'S A WINDOW INTO WHAT IS

173
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:27,241
REALLY GOING ON IN AFGHANISTAN.

174
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,610
THE TALIBAN ARE FANATICAL

175
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:33,480
TYRANTS WHO ARE PRESSING THEIR

176
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,849
FELLOW AFGHAN HE IS.

177
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,284
AND WHAT THE AMERICANS AND THE

178
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:39,686
AFGHAN STATE IS, THEY CAME IN

179
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:40,287
THERE.

180
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:41,255
AMERICANS WILLING TO SACRIFICE

181
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:42,523
EVERYTHING THAT THEY CARE ABOUT

182
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:45,659
IN LIFE, AND I COULDN'T BE MORE

183
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,093
PROUD OF THEM.

184
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:48,896
>> WHY IS THIS FIGHT SO

185
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:49,730
