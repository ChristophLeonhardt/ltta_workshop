00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,330
but the fact that they're not

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,790
represented in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Parliament or in the</font>

35
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,930
mainstream press doesn't actually

necessarily mean that they also not

37
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,450
stupid why sure why sure why should just

38
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,430
because a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have taken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

now broken Houdin never say any much as

47
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,009
far as I know well I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we in the</font>

48
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,509
media as a participating for this in

49
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,040
that what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we're constantly</font>

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,770
covering what they're doing because they

51
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,570
kind of make good copy I suppose in it

52
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,340
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not it's not just that we</font>

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,960
are covering them it's the way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
the way covering<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think particularly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,890
left-wing press and the BBC has<font color="#E5E5E5"> an aura</font>

59
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,508
start over this directional national

60
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,959
debate I think sensible conservative

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,470
newspaper

62
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,080
such as my own saw immediately that this

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,070
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing to be taken seriously</font>

64
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">but we have to now fight against this</font>

65
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,510
this tide of mental slurry as people say

66
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,630
oh gosh these people really have

67
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,460
something to say they've got they've got

68
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,260
tremendously important ideas to put

69
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,840
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> why haven't they simply haven't</font>

70
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,750
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been down and I spent several hours</font>

71
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,180
being talked to by them as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're Mary</font>

72
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,830
and I'm not backward in coming forward

73
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,780
when it comes to conversation but I was

74
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,880
reduced to silence by the streams and

75
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,010
verbiage wish these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really feel</font>

what do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has to be nice I</font>

79
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,440
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clue that they wanted Tom Lehrer</font>

we're against poverty war and injustice

unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of you squares they</font>

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,370
now we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the London</font>

157
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,590
occupy<font color="#CCCCCC"> el and what is it cool is it</font>

158
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,780
occupy LSX that's what it's actually

159
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool isn't it there's these hundreds of</font>

160
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,460
people outside some pools and I'm

161
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering now that they've said that</font>

162
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,460
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any further</font>

163
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,690
dialogue with the City of London

Corporation easy time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

165
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,150
somewhere to take some action because I

166
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,160
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather sorry for all the small</font>

167
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,110
businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that area who must</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

168
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,410
suffering starbucks of course they're

169
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,960
rather thriving because all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

170
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,340
protesters are getting all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their</font>

171
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,660
coffee there they're going in there and

172
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,250
they're actually charging up their

173
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,840
mobile phones can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you believe all day</font>

174
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,419
every day now I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> anti capitalist</font>

175
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,780
isn't it not and will says who is harmed

176
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,520
by the simples occupies if they hadn't

177
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,900
pitched their tents you wouldn't be

178
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,490
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them tonight what you've</font>

179
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,129
got a point

180
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:42,499
will and and I do sometimes wonder

181
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,199
whether we in the media actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

182
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,629
know may ensure that these protests stay

183
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,429
on for longer when we talk about them

184
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:51,499
but I think it's a legitimate point of

185
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:53,179
discussion I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of people have</font>

186
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,619
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very strong views on this</font>

187
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,849
judging by the number of phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> calls</font>

188
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,919
that coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lbc tonight that's</font>

189
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,110
certainly the case quite like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

190
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,939
from people who've actually visited the

191
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">protesters maybe you've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

192
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,779
protest yourself why have you done that

193
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:07,459
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it will achieve in the</font>

194
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,459
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> because so far the demands that I've</font>

195
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,559
read are actually things that frankly

196
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,240
most people could do agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

197
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,589
they're a bit motherhood and apple pie

198
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:18,409
and but nobody actually says well this

199
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:19,849
is how we're going to achieve our

200
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,649
demands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's all right while</font>

201
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,300
protesting against something but in the

202
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,089
end you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution and</font>

203
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:28,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've heard any</font>

204
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,409
solutions coming from anybody on this

205
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,389
protest<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0845</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 60 60</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 973 miles is in</font>

206
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,339
reading hello miles good evening a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

207
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,199
not too bad what would you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

208
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,999
it's interesting that you just said then

209
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,009
in the end there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some</font>

210
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,319
solutions as if it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

211
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,629
truth is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has only just started if</font>

212
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,669
you take Occupy Wall Street which

213
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,679
happened in New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City for example</font>

214
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it started with 13 people and</font>

215
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,479
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about four weeks that it started</font>

216
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,999
to gain quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of momentum and that</font>

217
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:01,189
was when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the press was coming on and</font>

218
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,319
your previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> caller there was so much</font>

219
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">homonym with what he was saying a lot of</font>

220
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">straw man arguments which which what</font>

221
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,610
whoever he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the points he made is</font>

222
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,309
one judging him on and it was just

223
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,619
opinion I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know firstly has he</font>

224
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,719
been down there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

225
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:19,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely give him a decent perspective</font>

226
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,409
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality of what's going on there</font>

227
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:24,289
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd ask anyone listening on LBC now</font>

228
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:26,629
to go down there and make up your own

229
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,339
minds because what you're seeing here is

230
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:31,189
you are seeing a conflict of mainstream

231
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:33,500
media verse new media like the internet

232
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,779
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just give you one example there</font>

233
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,698
are a lot of TV cameras down there which

234
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,438
will interview people and yes there are

235
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,630
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are not articulate that</font>

236
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,458
does happen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are people who</font>

237
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,410
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have solutions right now now an</font>

238
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,000
example idea for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is there are</font>

239
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,189
people in life who perhaps are suffering

240
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:51,350
with an illness and may want to complain

241
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,730
about government not giving them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

242
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,779
treatment to have it

243
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,249
but just because they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

244
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:57,980
solution in mind somehow that<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes away</font>

245
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">their right to protest about it in the</font>

246
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">first place which i think is ridiculous</font>

247
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,430
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to finish my point on this the</font>

248
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,560
cameras record these people who don't

249
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,569
make great points and obviously won't

250
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:09,980
show the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the better</font>

251
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,689
points although tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've had some</font>

252
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:13,100
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have expressed their points</font>

253
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,019
and it's actually why do you like lbc

254
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,870
and so they censor it you know you color

255
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,059
it with an agenda and then what happens

256
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,680
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else has recorded it with</font>

257
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,509
their own camera and then uploaded it to

258
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:26,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube themselves and it's the full</font>

259
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,009
uncensored version and what you're

260
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,749
seeing here is a complete shift in

261
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,970
culture social media and on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

262
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">has only evolved in the past five years</font>

263
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:35,839
which luckily enough for me I've managed

264
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">to grow up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and live with and people are</font>

265
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,319
turning away from mainstream media and

266
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,970
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet to educate themselves</font>

267
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,759
and become their own journalists and so

268
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,379
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is if you want the best</font>

269
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,329
representation of what these people are

270
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,639
standing full and what who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the types</font>

271
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,379
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here instead of saying they're</font>

272
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,879
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know losers and they're people</font>

273
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,350
that should get jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

274
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,149
statistics that say that for every for

275
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,920
unemployed people there are in the UK

276
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,079
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one job available you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know these</font>

277
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,759
aren't people that have too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

278
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have anything better</font>

279
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,519
today there are some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there who</font>

280
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,709
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have jobs and they go back to</font>

281
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the camp and sleep there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font>

282
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">them I I have a job luckily so I live in</font>

283
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,110
my house but I do go there when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

284
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,050
and participate in what is frankly an

285
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,120
amazing process and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the</font>

286
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,769
mainstream media needs to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in</font>

287
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,839
denial and give them a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more credit</font>

288
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,819
for what they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if this whole</font>

289
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:28,040
thing in society we like to spit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

290
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,959
people below us when actually the real

291
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,480
fraudsters in society are the bankers

292
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,670
and the elite that are evading millions

293
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,230
of pounds every day which you may say is

294
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,240
legal because it's you know in pack

295
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,019
paypal if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's evading it's not legal</font>

296
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,059
avoiding is<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is activate isn't my</font>

297
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,649
terminology was poured and I apologize

298
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,740
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> my point is just because something</font>

299
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">is legal or it's illegal doesn't mean</font>

300
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:57,019
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the morality is on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that same</font>

301
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,269
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all I'm so no but what what</font>

302
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,069
it means is that you then campaign to

303
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:03,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">change things and I mean I absolutely</font>

304
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,699
agree that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have got every right</font>

305
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,370
to campaign and protest absolutely

306
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,200
a problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whatsoever and I</font>

307
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,640
think you made some very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> points</font>

308
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,050
that particularly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

309
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,540
media operate I mean I'm a creature of

310
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,220
the new media I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sitting in</font>

311
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">this chair now had I not five six years</font>

312
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago started my own blog and and done all</font>

313
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,350
of that so I'm absolutely with you on

314
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,390
that and it's a very democratizing

315
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,790
process because ordinary people who

316
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,680
previously wouldn't have been able to

317
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their voices heard now can make</font>

318
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,580
their voices heard so you're absolutely

319
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,610
right on that all I'm saying is that um

320
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,130
once a point has been made is it not

321
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,410
time then to try and think well how can

322
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,900
we take this fool just just putting

323
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,460
together sort of a hundred or two

324
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,990
hundred or have many tents there are

325
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">people sleeping in them overnight that</font>

326
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
doesn't actually achieve anything of

327
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,990
itself does happen in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> no well</font>

328
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,670
again we're going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this</font>

329
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,680
rhetoric in the end we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there yet</font>

330
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a process that's going to keep</font>

331
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,070
growing and growing and it's when the

332
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,000
government have to start acknowledging

333
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,850
it not by saying stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think David</font>

334
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cameron says like along the lines of</font>

collaborated industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day it would</font>

339

have less impact with engaging with the

340
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,170
mainstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> media than it's doing now if</font>

341
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,910
you know these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> last resorts for</font>

342
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,560
people if there are better ways of

343
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,970
bringing up in Parliament and that's

344
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,800
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we can look at this you know</font>

345
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,810
this online democracy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do now</font>

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,610
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get a petition we can take</font>

347
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,830
the EU where they were X number of

348
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,480
signatures they brought it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

349
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,650
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just dismissed it whether the</font>

350
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,050
reasons were valid or not that adds<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

351
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,060
essence of apathy which has grown over

352
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,910
the years people feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we work</font>

353
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,680
our jobs and we leave the politicians to

354
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,930
do it and unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation is</font>

355
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,370
getting worse and the current system

356
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,520
isn't working and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm not</font>

357
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">anti-capitalist to be honest socialism</font>

358
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,080
capitalism communism that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

359
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,940
corrupt in their own ways they're just

360
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,380
on a sliding scale of governmental

361
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,050
intervention and there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem is</font>

362
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,790
Mars isn't it that there is no perfect

363
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,339
system no one's ever found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

364
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,440
perfect system of government the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font>

365
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,240
economic system if they would all be

366
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,390
using it that well there is and this

367
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,350
would go into a whole nother

368
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,880
conversation so i'll just leave with a

369
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,440
very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> explanation of it it is</font>

370
