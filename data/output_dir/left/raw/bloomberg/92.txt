1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,760
What does it take to change the world?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,800
A big army?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,600
A cure to a pandemic?

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
A Revolution?

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,780
All of these either take a lot of people,
thousands of hours, or massive amounts of space.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,980
But for Julian Assange, all he needs is one room, an internet connection, and the world will listen.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,000
Assange is located here, and more specifically, right
here.

8
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:31,579
And from that location he’s posted government
secrets, classified documents, and leaked

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,420
emails of some of the world’s most powerful
people.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,740
And in doing so been labeled a hero, a villain,
a nihilist, and everything in between.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,400
This is how an Australian programmer sequestered
in the Ecuadorian embassy in London became

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,220
one of the most influential and notorious
people in the world.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,000
Born in 1971 in Townsville, Australia.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
Assange has always been on the move.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,880
Living in over 30 homes by the time he was
in his mid-teens, Assange along with his mother

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,429
and half brother finally settled down in Melbourne.

17
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:06,090
His introduction to hacking started at 16
when he was given a Commodore 64

18
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,190
which he attached to a modem.

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,250
He attended the University of Melbourne where
he studied programming, physics and mathematics.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,160
He never graduated but that doesn’t mean
he didn’t get an education.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,780
By 1991, Assange hacked into the Pentagon,
US Navy and other branches of the U.S. government.

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,940
In 1996, he was caught by the Australian Federal
Police and charged for over 30 counts of hacking

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,420
and computer related crimes.

24
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,170
He didn’t get any jail time but was fined
$2,100.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,280
I think the first taste of what would come
later was the hacking that he did as a young programmer.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,860
And that really sort of foreshadowed a healthy
skepticism of the use and abuse of technology

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,880
by governments

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,960
That’s Vernon Silver.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
I’m a reporter at Bloomberg’s investigations
team.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,700
Assange's youth as a hacker laid the foundation
for him to start Wikileaks in 2006.

31
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,380
But what is WikiLeaks?

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,310
It’s a website that posts unfiltered, usually
classified documents.

33
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,170
What separates it from every other media
outlet is they have no editorial hierarchy.

34
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,110
With a publication like the NY Times, information
comes in, they take that information, package

35
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,119
it, then disseminate it for the public to
see.

36
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,600
Wikileaks however, cuts out the middleman.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,650
Wikileaks gathers information most of it given
to them anonymously so what they’re doing

38
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,181
is really very simple, they get the information
in one end from who gives it to them and out

39
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,989
the other with sometimes minimal interference.

40
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,239
Julian Assange is the leader of that, the
mastermind, the creator and really because

41
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,489
he thinks of it as a journalistic enterprise,
the editor in chief.

42
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,849
But every story starts with a source and Assange
has some unconventional sources.

43
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:40,680
Julian Assange does not hack as far as we
know.

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,310
He is the recipient of people who are either
insiders who give him secret documents or

45
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,359
hacked emails from a foreign power.

46
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,790
That’s Eli Lake.

47
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,770
I’m a columnist for Bloomberg.

48
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,019
And there was no source bigger for Assange
than Chelsea Manning, who used to be known

49
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,879
as US soldier Bradley Manning.

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,100
In 2010, Manning provided Assange and Wikileaks
with hundreds of thousands of leaked government documents.

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,600
Wikileaks quietly began releasing the documents
in February of 2010, then made big headlines

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,740
in April by posting what is now known as the
Collateral Murder video.

53
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,720
It was a vivid graphic video, it changed the
debate on the Iraq war and importantly it

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,360
put wikileaks on the map when they put it
online and they couldn't be ignored at point.

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,569
And those leaks were just the beginning.

56
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:33,269
They went on to post more than 90,000 leaked
documents known as the Afghan War logs, 390,000

57
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,599
documents known as the Iraq war logs, and
a quarter of a million private messages between

58
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,040
diplomats, called cables, in what is now known
as cablegate.

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,889
These leaks were met with very real ethical
questions.

60
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,829
The problem with publishing those cables was
that a number of confidential sources for

61
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,420
US diplomats who faced real danger when their
names were exposed...

62
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,989
Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton drove
the point home that...

63
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:05,230
Every country including the United States
must be able to have candid conversations

64
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,890
about the people and nations with whom they
deal.

65
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,569
Shortly after Cablegate the Swedish Government
issued an arrest warrant for Assange on allegations

66
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,430
of rape and molestation.

67
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,970
He claimed the allegations were fabricated
to get him extradited to the United States,

68
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,890
a claim the US government denied.

69
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,320
Either way, Assange's next move was….

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,140
to seek refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy which really was the beginning of the new chapter

71
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,470
in his life and what we are dealing with now
which is him being him stuck in london.

72
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,620
What was supposed to be an office in an embassy
is now Assange’s self-imposed prison to

73
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,090
this very day.

74
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,890
But that doesn’t mean he’s slowed down.

75
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,550
Since being trapped in the Embassy, Wikileaks
has leaked files about Guantanamo Bay prisoners,

76
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,180
Syrian political figures, and the draft to
the Trans Pacific Partnership.

77
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,280
And then came the 2016 US election.

78
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,170
Thousands of leaked emails show Democratic
party officials possibly plotting against

79
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,320
Bernie Sanders in his race against Hillary
Clinton.

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
Over the course of 68 days, Wikileaks released 20,000

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,360
confidential Democratic National Committee emails.

82
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,100
In terms of the Presidential race, if you
look right here, when Assange released the

83
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,780
first batch of emails, Trump actually takes
his first lead against Clinton.

84
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,470
I think we’ve had enough of the Clintons
in all fairness.

85
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,660
Once wikileaks started exposing secrets of
the Democratic party, Julian Assange became

86
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,620
a hero to many on the right.

87
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,080
Public opinion kind of flip flopped.

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,460
Wikileaks!

89
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,060
From the emails we now know Hillary Clinton’s
campaign manager makes risotto...

90
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,500
and also how the DNC squashed Bernie Sanders’ campaign.

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,740
One thing we don’t know is who gave Assange
the stolen emails in the first place.

92
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,260
Many leading democrats say they suspected
it was the Russians.

93
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,160
They released an analysis from a private cybersecurity
firm that had said it was the Russians.

94
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,320
But Assange claims...

95
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,380
Our source is not the Russian government and it is not state party.

96
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,900
So this is where we stand today.

97
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,270
The public still does not know who provided
the emails to WikiLeaks.

98
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,110
Meanwhile, Assange is still running Wikileaks
and still leaking documents.

99
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,090
In March 2017, he started publishing documents
from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence.

100
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,300
called “Vault 7”.

101
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,140
The CIA, the agency charged with finding and
keeping our top secrets, can’t keep its

102
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,700
own secrets.

103
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,120
As long as Assange has a connection to the
world, no government secret will never be

104
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:20,300
too far from exposure.

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,680
Julian Assange is still in the embassy, maybe
he’ll leave, maybe he won’t.

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,420
Kind of regardless, his work has been done.

107
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,030
He’s changed the way that people think about
their governments, about their own secrets,

108
00:06:31,030 --> 00:00:00,000
about their own hackability, and really the
world has changed because of him.
