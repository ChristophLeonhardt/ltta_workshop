with a world in a football frenzy we're
meeting a group of fans who've decided
to take on a different approach to make
sure they don't miss a thing
these friends living in London have
taken weeks off work to watch the World
Cup the twist is that they have to watch
each game with someone who comes from
whichever countries playing this has
been quite a journey from celebrating
with a big crowd from Iceland
to making new friends with Australians
- watching a game in a Nigerian barber
shop - even hiding in a bathroom at a
Tunisian restaurant to cheer England's
goals without offending the hosts didn't
I say to
how many countries have you guys met up
with already for the game so far we've
done 19 different countries in eight
days so exhausted
we watched England in the only Tunisian
restaurant in the UK little Portugal for
the Portugal Portugal gave main stock
well it was literally like stepping into
Lisbon what do you want to take away
football for a while I mean after the
fourth day I was invited to say to the
boys there's anyone a little bit sick of
football but then there was a another
game on and we just get straight back
into it we're seeing parts of London
we've not seen we're meeting people from
different walks of life different
countries and it's it's kind of it's
humbling and it's like it's RIT connects
us with our city more than anything we
ever do
as I say Church in our artsy London
you
