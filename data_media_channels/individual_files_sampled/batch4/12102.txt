other things that I hate so in the middle of the Super Bowl they did a preview for solo no just no no no no no so here's it will show you a little bit of this I've been running scams on the streets since I was 10 just kicked out a slight Academy for having a mind in my own I'm gonna be a pilot the best in the galaxy kid I'm putting together a crew you win that's yes that might be the only person what you really are what's that Rustam no no synthesizers please no synthesizers okay yes I see it's the Millennium Falcon yes we've all seen the one in Falkland okay so a few things about this preview so it would be the iconic use of the Millennium Falcon over and over and over and over again you can't do it again right I mean you already already did the call back in force awakens and that was nice and now you can't go back to us also Han Solo has the coolest entry in film history right his entrance in in Star Wars Episode four is one of the coolest entrances ever he's literally sitting in a cantina and shoots a guy in the middle of a conversation about how he's a rogue okay that's awesome and yes Han shot first okay and now everybody is in at night you want the backstory like I don't need the backstory he was only 31 when he did I think it was Thor twenty-nine he's a kid when he did when he did Star Wars Episode four and the movie is supposed to be even younger he's supposed to be like late 20s what could have happened to him that was so formative also I'm not seeing that the tremendous sense of humor that was sort of necessary in in Han Solo Hans whole things that he was cynical and now they're gonna make him if they make him not cynical it's gonna be so obnoxious if they make him just an innocent right the deep down he's good we know deep down he's good but that was the whole discovery of Episode four right why are you ruining it with the whole discovery of Episode four is the deep down Han Solo's good he spends the entire time being a row and then he comes back at the end and saves Luke because deep down he's actually a softy that's the whole point just your stupid stupid stupid but there was no way it was gonna be good they just maybe it'll surprise me but the reason rogue one worked is because they were using ancillary characters not because they were trying to recast the original characters is why I think the prequels for for Star Wars don't work I don't want Darth Vader's backstory I just want to ask Vader and rogue one none of these characters were in the main film except regarding fighter who appears exactly the way he appears in the main film so so we will see if it is as bad as it looks maybe it won't be I'll go see it anyway because hey it's Star Wars but well we'll save our rip on it for actually seeing it
