1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
I listened to lawyers on both sides last

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,840
night and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about things</font>

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,270
that had just nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">listened to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a panel of judges and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,010
comment on that I will not comment on

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,400
the statements made by certainly one

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,310
judge but I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest that if</font>

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,150
these judges wanted to in my opinion

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,720
help the court in terms of respect for

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,810
the court they do what they should be

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,329
doing I mean it's it's so sad they

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,309
should be you know when you read

13
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,280
something so simple and so beautifully

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,410
written and so perfectly written other

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,829
than the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement of course having</font>

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,160
to do with Yoshi but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read</font>

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,840
something so perfectly written and so

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,480
clear to anybody and then you have

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,399
lawyers and you watched I watched last

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,820
night in amazement and i heard things

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,109
that I couldn't believe things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

22
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:02,910
really had nothing to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> what i</font>

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,780
just read and I don't ever want to call

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,299
a court bias so won't call it biased and

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,979
we haven't had a decision yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> but courts</font>

26
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,689
seemed to be so political and it would

27
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">be so great for a justice system if they</font>

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,640
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read a statement and do</font>

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:00:00,000
what's right
