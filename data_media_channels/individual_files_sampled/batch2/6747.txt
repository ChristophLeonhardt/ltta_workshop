I was very happy to see that everyone in London spoke English it was really helpful when I was in Germany not on this trip but on prior trip a couple months ago everyone spoke English there too but well but in Italy a lot of wouldn't speak any English so you would have to like just stick you late and you know grunt and snort and you know communicate in some way what what sentence did you need to sort oh one one of the days we were going to a winery in the middle of Tuscany and I got lost yeah the GPS wasn't working because there's no cell reception so I go to the place that my GPS told me to go to it's just little house so that this can't be it and this like Italian grandmother comes out and she is a graduate operating super-fat I've no idea what she's saying so I I take out my phone I point to the phone I'm like I'm trying to go here with the address on it she can't see it and she's like she told me to go inside get her glasses so she goes inside she gets a glass door playing charades this is a comedy verse on her glasses and his all and then she goes like this right you should tell me where to go except it was all
