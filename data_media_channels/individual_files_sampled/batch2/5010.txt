the president's latest move in his trade war has Republicans fuming they really do not like there's 12 billion dollars in emergency aid for farmers who are hurt by the tariffs a solution to a problem created by the President himself when you choose a war of choice which is what this trade war is and then you say afterwards let's just solve it by buying people gold-plated crutches the farmers and ranchers of America they don't want crutches they want to work just a bad deal and all the way around bad for the taxpayers horrible for farmers just give me trade not aid you know we've spent decades developing these markets let us have access to them and the trade war now the president responding this morning on Twitter quote every time I see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking and let me just make something clear before I move on I don't think there is anyone saying please stop trade talks people are saying please stop with unnecessary tariffs that make no sense those are two different things and the president is conflating two issues and those tariffs are hurting the American people this is coming as he gets ready to meet with the President of the European Commission on the table tariffs on European car imports that could jeopardize a trillion dollar trade relationship with 15 million jobs at stake on both sides of the Atlantic remember states like South Carolina you know what they do have auto manufacturing plants for some of those overseas companies joining me now Fred Kemp he's the CEO and president of the Atlantic Council MSNBC political contributor and my friend Jason Johnson politics editor at the route comm and Chris Wilson who is a Republican pollster art Fred I've got to go to you first I was anxious to see Larry Kudlow this morning who was on TV because if you remember before he joined the administration he wrote a piece just a few weeks before urging the president not to move forward with tariffs he's been a true free market sky for decades yet this morning he claims that this problem was not of the president's own making please take a listen past presidents in both political parties have tried to fix the broken world trading system China is the worst all I'm saying is this is not at mr. Trump's own making this is something that mr. Trump inherited very unfair trading practices this is a very difficult task reform always is there's a swamp for the world Trading citizen and he's trying to drain it Larry Kudlow is right unfair trading practices exist credit to the president for taking them head-on but Larry Kudlow is not answering the question the issue that we're facing today is the impact of these tariffs by putting these tires forward he has now gone around Congress and he's creating 12 billion dollars in emergency aid for farmers using a tactic that was created during the Depression so while the president and his administration claimed the economy is stronger than era they are now using depression-era vessels to save trump voters ie farmers and by the way not all of them know look first and foremost this farm issue just underscores that as trade approaches and working but it's it's not working in a huge broad sense and then a narrow sense the broader sense is we are losing or could lose the ability to guide and shape the rules-based order of institutions and practices that we created with our allies after World War Two and who's going to step in to do that well it's going to be just the people that the Larry Kudlow are saying our biggest problem is and that's the Chinese in the narrower sense with the EU Commission president in town this week Yunker you have two things he's trying to achieve the first he's trying to achieve is to defuse the crisis before it gets to auto tariffs that would be that would be the worst direction and none of the advisors around the president actually wanted to go in that direction but the president may want to the best possibility is you could actually turn this around reverse the aluminum steel tariffs and and there is a potential for a transatlantic trade deal based on something close to zero tariffs the President himself talked about it the g7 in Canada and there is a possibility the Yonker will bring some sort of deal of that sort to the table even if it's just starting with with the car industry well that would be great but in the meantime GM announced today a billion dollars worth of losses and they're citing rising commodity costs that's aluminum and steel you've got Ron Johnson saying our behavior is similar to a to a Soviet for public wear , stars are doling out favors and aid to industries that they choose Lisa Murkowski is saying fine just the farmers what about other industries oil and gas seafood manufacturing they're all suffering - well what I what I don't understand about President Trump he has his name on golf courses he has his name on hotels so far what he's been doing is dismantling things the Iranian trade deal and the worst decision of his administration in terms of China and trade was was getting out of the trans-pacific partnership since he got out of that the Japanese put it together with 11 countries the US is out last week the EU and Japan signed the biggest trade deal in history and we're on the sidelines and so what he has to do right now is he talks about getting leverage by being tough on trade in many respects that could be true but now is the time to cash in that leverage to close NAFTA to get a deal on NAFTA to get a deal to reverse what we've been doing with EU and then get a better trade deal to show that he can get a trade better trade deal by being tough in the outset but he hasn't yet shown that he can turn these trade threats into better deals now is the time he has to start doing that Kevin Hassett told us just a couple of days ago it's not a trade war we're currently in a trade negotiation and to that point we have to remind our audience the president made a campaign promise to tear up TPP and give us something better he tore it up he's given us nothing and TPP continues on without us Chris let's go back to the farmers we already subsidize farmers so how unusual is this and to do it without the support of Congress well I don't think it is all that unusual because if you look at I mean to say that this isn't working yet it's sort of like saying your office of gaming plan isn't working before you've even had a chance to touch the ball and this is one thing that as you mentioned earlier President Trump was consistent about during the campaign is really consistent about this over the last 20 years of his life is a feels like the US has been tied up and getting the wrong side of the deal on all these on Iran negotiations to other countries but you know I grew up on a farm in Oklahoma and the complex system of Ag credit and contracts and lending makes it a different type of scenario than it is with the commodities that you mentioned earlier where they had to be bailed out earlier for this for this for it to be given time to be successful and look President Trump Donald Trump has always been a high-stakes gambler it worked form in the real estate world I think that's the same approach he stated they just say it works for me in the real estate world in the real estate world president Trump has gone bankrupt over four times okay in the branding and marketing world he's made a mint he's been a business genius so in getting elected he is fantastic at taking on issues where Americans have been hurt and saying I'm going to saw them and you know what that plays to the American people and it should he said I'm going to solve income inequality when no one else had the audacity to do it but when you actually look at the policies he's putting in place he's hurting those people who believed him at what he's does best was selling well right now and as he his policies are given time to take place and take hold I think it is a matter of giving it time and for to see who's gonna blame first that's what he gets down to any Republicans senator like a Ron Johnson or Ben Sasse who believe that the Trump was gonna blink first and relieve these terrorists before the other side did I think was mistaken and myopic in their approach in terms of dealing with the president it is of it this is a chance that if he was successful it could solve a lot of the problems that you mentioned earlier but if he's not to the point you're making it could also put us into a global trade war that could be very damaging to these come market okay then I'm gonna be sassy and cynical Jason one could say this is a political move ahead of the 2018 midterms when you've got people in farm state strums bass who are saying uh-oh I'm getting screwed here sir well not only that but I love when people gamble with everybody else's money because that's essentially what he's doing he's always said that's what he likes - yeah he said we're betting with the bank's money betting that the money inside of banks are the deposits from hard-working American regular people in Ohio in Indiana in Nebraska all places I've grown up and lived but here's the other issue in what this demonstrates it's just like TPP and everything else of Trump works on the guy never has a plan B I mean if you look at the plan this 12 billion dollars part of that is supposed to be spent on opening up new markets for the farmers to sell in why didn't you have that in advance why didn't you say I'm throwing down these tariffs because I've already cut four or five deals with these other countries I don't know if I'm a farmer if I necessarily want to be negotiating with the US government for prices I don't know if that's necessarily gonna be better for me and my product than what I was able to do with Mexico but I was able to do with China so there's no long-term planning it's totally about 2018 Fred let's bring you in as it relates to China you know with President Obama he was very predictable so if you are I'm gonna say let's call China a trading adversary given how predictable Obama was they knew exactly what they wanted to do could the unpredictability or irrationality of Trump in some level worked in his favor here cuz that's I don't see it but walk me through it see I think it could so here's the narrative of a pivot to the positive with our allies that could actually end up addressing China and Larry Kudlow said China is the worst well if you want to go after China then you want to have your allies on your side you don't want to have your allies against us exactly so so so you want you should have done PPP that way you get the Asia allies on your side we don't have that but we could still talk on it there are twenty more than 20 parts of the TPP agreement the Japanese and others kept open because they were in our interest we could negotiate our way back into that the first step we have to do is we have to get NAFTA done to get NAFTA done you're going to have to take aluminum and and steel tariffs off of Mexico and Canada among other things if you're going to do that you're going to have to do that for your allies as well in Europe so I'm watching this week as a truly important week with Younker in town will he start pivoting to the positive this week or will he double down with Auto tariffs if he's doubling down in Auto terrorist we've got some ways to go but I I do agree that you could get more he's actually part of the reason the Trump is very popular with his constituency is he saying things that are true we've got bad trade deals with with China we could have better trade deals with Europe but now is the time he has to pivot to the positive with the and use the leverage to get a better deal out of China and it really has to start this week we have not seen much pivoting from the president across the board but do you think ensemble on some level this is it's so crazy it just might work because we talked about how farmers are getting hurt but our own colleague Vaughn Hilliard has been out throughout the contrary visiting with farmers and many have said let's see how this goes I voted for the guy let's give him some time no I think that's really the point is is sort of the high-stakes approach of going after this and seeing who's going to blame first and I know from everything we know about Donald Trump it doesn't look like that's going to be him now at what point does that reach reach it's the line of demarcation where it begins to hurt people in a way that you can't pull back and I think that is moving into 2018 and kind of planning for it I do think there are concerns in the White House that if this does go too far and our constituency is hurting too the cost of synesthetes we might be able to pick up in North Dakota Montana West Virginia Pennsylvania and Indiana and that's why you do see them taking actions now but I think from a standpoint of it'll be really just see what comes out of these meetings because if there is the opportunity to cut a deal and Trump comes out of this with a successful with a successful renegotiating these trade deals then all bets are off in terms what could happen in 2018 it really creates a positive environment Republicans and right now it's sort of a you don't know which way it's going to go because the economy is doing very well the issue though in the wait-and-see let's see how it goes one of the problems with that is the President of the United States lies every single day and he lies unnecessarily when he talks about the stock market which is done beautifully well and it's up 30% since he won he lies and says it's up 40% and and so why it's hard for me to get my head around this the people who voted for him wanted something different and they wanted a better life and he lies every day and I can't figure out why those people support him because because he provides something sort of symbolic and emotional he's fighting back and that's what people have always wanted they didn't feel like George Bush and Barack Obama was fighting for them but but here's the other thing to remember we're talking about the midterms these other world leaders have elections to write they have reasons to not blink as well so we're talking about yeah Trump's gonna he's gonna stand up these guys in a sterile me I look there are other world leaders who are like yeah I'm not going to not gonna bend to you because I'll look bad with my own constituents oh the president not only is he gambling with other people savings and gambling with other people's finances and it is sort of harvesting season that's what we have actually going on during the midterms you have elections in other countries where other world leaders don't want to make him look good a lot of people don't seem to realize that looking like you're weak against Donald Trump is poison for you abroad it's poison for you in Europe it is poison for you in South America so if he thinks he can bully people he is forgetting they got jobs too Fred before we go can you think of an example of a policy in this administration where the president is fighting back is talking tough and actually winning at the moment there isn't a really good sign of that the people in the administration I talked to say look this is normal first two years of an administration you set the table last two years of administration yes well I think he has to start now because this is this is an administration that seems to be on acceleration in many ways and he also has to understand this really is about who's going to be the leader of the world the the Russians are trying to replace us or displaces the excuse me the Russians are trying to disrupt us the Chinese are trying to replace us or displace us you see the Chinese stepping in with the EU in the same week that he's negotiating with Trump to make a statement you see then the EU going off to Japan so the world doesn't stay in the same place and so they're amazing stakes and large strategic stakes here that I don't think the president entirely gets well I'm not saying that it's good or bad but for the White House to say this is just what any administration looks like in the first two years is absolutely untrue that's White House simply talk in their book okay there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're
