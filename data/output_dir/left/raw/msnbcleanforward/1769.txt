I DON’T THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS THAT, BUT I DO THINK

130
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,266
UNDERSTANDS THAT, BUT I DO THINK HE BELIEVES THAT THIS IS A

131
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:02,201
HE BELIEVES THAT THIS IS A WINNING STRATEGY BECAUSE THERE

132
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:03,769
WINNING STRATEGY BECAUSE THERE WILL NEVER BE A SHUT DOWN

133
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,003
WILL NEVER BE A SHUT DOWN BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT

134
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:07,806
BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT HE WILL GET SOME KIND OF FUNDING

135
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:08,607
HE WILL GET SOME KIND OF FUNDING FOR HIS WALL.

136
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:10,509
FOR HIS WALL. IT WON’T BE THE FULL AMOUNT THAT

137
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,745
IT WON’T BE THE FULL AMOUNT THAT HE’S ASKED FOR, BUT HE CAN TAKE

00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:14,413
HE’S ASKED FOR, BUT HE CAN TAKE THAT CHECK, PUT IT IN HIS POCKET

THAT CHECK, PUT IT IN HIS POCKET AND DECLARE VICTORY.

140
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,883
AND DECLARE VICTORY. SO, HE’LL SPEND THE NEXT SEVERAL

141
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:20,118
SO, HE’LL SPEND THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS BEATING UP ON CONGRESS,

00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,921
WEEKS BEATING UP ON CONGRESS, DEMANDING THIS FUNDING AND THEN
