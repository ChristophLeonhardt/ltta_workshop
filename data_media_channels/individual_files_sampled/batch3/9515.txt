A BETTER ECONOMY, YOU WANT JOBS? THAT'S TONIGHT. PEACE ON THE PENINSULA, INSPIRING OPEN MONOLOGUE FROM SINGAPORE. IT HAPPENED AFTER MONTHS OF DOUBTS, SPECULATIONS AND NEGOTIATION WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE HISTORY AND MADE THE HISTORY. BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE SUMMIT WENT VERY WELL EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS. THE MEETINGS BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN WERE REPORTEDLY PRODUCTIVE. A SOLID FIRST STEP IN NEGOTIATING WHAT IS THE COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE, IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. TRUMP AND KIM EVEN SIGNED A BILATERAL AGREEMENT. THE TWO POINTS AGREED TO ESTABLISH NEW RELATIONS. NEXT, THE COUNTRIES PROMISED TO WORK TOWARDS PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. THIRD, KIM JONG UN REAFFIRMED HIS COMMITMENT TO THE COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. AND IF THIS IS NOT REALLY WIDELY REPORTED, NORTH KOREA AGREED TO RECOVER AND RETURN THE REMAINS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS THAT WERE KILLED DURING THE KOREAN WAR. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN HAD THIS TO SAY AFTER SIGNING THAT JOINT RESOLUTION. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. SPEAK TO THE LETTER R GOODW PROUD OF WHA TOOK MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN IT HAS IN THE PAST. WE BOTH WANT TO DO SOMETHING, AND WE HAVE DEVELOPED A VERY SPECIAL BOND. PEOPLE WILL BE VERY IMPRESSED, VERY HAPPY AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF A VERY BIG AND VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR THE WORLD. Sean: TODAY THE POSITIVE REACTION CONTINUED AND THE PRESIDENT REPORTED QUOTE THE WORLD HAS TAKEN A FROM POTENTIAL NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE AND MORE ROCKET LAUNCHES, NUCLEAR TESTING, OR RESEARCH. OUR DAY TOGETHER WAS HISTORIC AND AT LEAST TALKS OCCURRED ONLY AFTER THE RELEASE OF THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES AFTER AN AGREEMENT FROM KIM JONG UN TO HALT NUCLEAR TESTS AND ICBM TESTS AND FIRING MISSILES OVER JAPAN. OF COURSE NORTH KOREA'S DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THEIR KEY MISSILE ON SITES. ALL OF THIS IS WITHOUT ANY CONCESSION. IN MY INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEY EVEN INDICATED THAT NORTH KOREANS CONCESSIONS WILL GO MUCH DEEPER THAN THEIR WHAT THEY SAID OPENLY THAN THEIR WHAT THEY SAID OPENL OPENLY. President Trump: WE LOOK AT WHAT HE HAS DONE, SO WE GOT OUR HOUSES BACK BUT WE HAVE BLOWN UP ONE OF THE PRIMARY TESTING SITES. SOME PEOPLE SAY THEIR ONLY TESTING SITES. SO IT'S THE PROCESS AND IT'S REALLY MOVING RAPIDLY. MEANWHILE SHORTLY AFTER SIGNING THE AGREEMENT OR WRAPPING UP THE TALKS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HELD A VERY LENGTHY NEWS CONFERENCE GIVING IMMEDIATE REACTION TO HIS HISTORIC MEETING. I GOT TO SIT IN THE SECOND ROW. JIM ACOSTA WAS FOUR SEATS DOWN. THEY CAN NEWS CNN, TAKE A LOOK. President Trump: CHAIRMAN KIM AND I READ JUST COMPLETED AN AGREEMENT IN WHICH HE REAFFIRMED HIS COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THIS AS MUCH, IF NOT MORE THAN ME. WE SEE A VERY BRIGHT FUTURE FOR NORTH KOREA. THE SANCTIONS WILL COME OFF WHEN WE ARE SURE THAT THE NUKES ARE NO LONGER EFFECTIVE. THE PRESIDENT HAS AGREED TO MEET, HE HAS GIVEN UP SO MUCH. I GIVE UP NOTHING, I'M HERE. I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 25 HOURS BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO DO SINCE WE HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING LITERALLY AROUND THE CLOCK. OTTO WARMBIER IS A VERY SPECIAL PERSON AND HE WILL BE IN A LONG TIME FOR A LONG TIME IN MY LIFE. HIS PARENTS ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. HE DID NOT DIE IN VAIN, HE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. OF THE PRESIDENT HAD MORE TO SAY ABOUT OTTO WARMBIER IN OUR INTERVIEW. IT'S A STRATEGY OF PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH AND A STRATEGY OF BRIBERY AND APPEASEMENT THROUGH BOWING THROUGH DICTATORS. NOW TONIGHT THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE NOW COMING INTO THE FLOOR. THE WEAK AND FECKLESS LEADERSHIP, THEY WERE LEFT TO DEAL WITH A WORLD AND THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF OBAMA'S PEOPLE OF EARTH'S THAT GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USHER IN TRUMP. RAGAN IS CALLING THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND EVIL EMPIRE WITH MANY IN THE MEDIA FREAKING OUT THAT THE CALIFORNIA COWBOY, RAGAN, WAS LEADING US TOWARD A NUCLEAR WAR. LET'S GO THROUGH HISTORY. THEY HAVE PREACHED THE SUPREMACY OF THE STATE. AND THE DOMINATION OF ALL PEOPLES ON THE EARTH. THEY ARE THE FOCUS OF EVIL ON THE MODERN WORLD. SO IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS, I URGE YOU TO BE AWARE OF THE TEMPTATION OF PRIDE AND TEMPTATION OF LIVELY DECLARING YOURSELVES ABOVE IT ALL AND EQUALLY AT FAULT. THEREBY REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG AND GOOD AND EVIL. Tucker: JUST MONTHS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO ENGAGED IN TOUGH RHETORIC CALLING KIM JONG UN, LITTLE ROCKET MAN. JUST LIKE REAGAN, HE WENT INTO A COMPLETE MELTDOWN ONCE AGAIN PREDICTING A NUCLEAR MELTDOWN. President Trump: NORTH KOREA DOES NOT MAKE ANY THREATS TOWARD THE UNITED STATES, THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE, FURY AND POWER, THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. FRANKLY, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE QUESTIONING THAT STATEMENT, MAYBE IT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS TO OUR COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME FOR MANY YEARS AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT PEOPLE SUCK UP TO THE COUNTRY AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH IS A TRAGEDY AND CAN'T BE ALLOWED. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS IN GUAM, THERE WILL BE BIG, BIG TROUBLE IN NORTH KOREA. HE DOES ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO MAMA OR ANYPLACE ELSE THAT IS AN AMERICAN TERRITORY OR AMERICAN ALLY, HE WILL REGRET IT. Tucker: THEY RAMPED UP MILITARY SPENDING, MILITARY DRILLS AND MILITARY PRESENCE AND REAFFIRMED COMMITMENTS TO SHIELD OUR ALLIES FROM HOSTILE ADVERSARIES. ONE WAY OR SIMILARITY COMES FROM THE TWO PRESIDENTS' WILLINGNESS TO WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE. AND BEFORE ULTIMATELY NEGOTIATING THE END OF THE COLD WAR, PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY FROM TALKS WITH MIKAL GORBACHEV. A FEW WEEKS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP CANCELED THE SUMMIT OVER A DISPUTE AND HAS FREQUENTLY ASSERTED HIS WILLINGNESS TO WALK AWAY FROM A BAD DEAL. AND A BONUS, BOTH REAGAN AND TRUMP OVERSAW A BOOMING ECONOMIES, BOTH IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM, TAX CUTS, REMOVING BIRDING SOME REGULAR REGULATIONS. THE MEDIA SAW THIS COMING, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED. BUT THESE WERE THE SAME PEOPLE. THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT DONALD TRUMP WINNING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AND LAUGHING WHEN HE GOT INTO THE RACE. AND AT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE WRONG ABOUT TRUMP AND RUSSIA COLLUSION IN THE SO-CALLED SCANDAL. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ONLY ONE COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS WAS HILLARY CLINTON. OF COURSE THEY ARE COMPLETELY OBSESSED WITH ANYTHING TABLOID. THIS COULD BE THE LAST NAIL IN THE COFFIN. STORMY DANIELS CLAIMS PRESIDENT TRUMP BROKE THE LAW AND HAD HER BOWLING TO. DOES STORMY DANIELS HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S NUMBER? IT SEEMS THAT WAY. HOW HIS STORMY WEATHERING THIS? STORMY SPEAKS. ARE YOU SHOCKED OR SURPRISED BY THIS? I'M NOT SURPRISED, IN ONE WAY I AM PROUD OF. WE ARE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL, AT LEAST NOT IF YOU ARE BORN IN AS THE PRESIDENT PUT IT, A COUNTRY. IS THERE A DIFFERENT, IF THE PRESIDENT SAID LEAP HOLE AND LEAP HOUSE? APPARENTLY NOT. LISTEN TO HOW THE CNN FAKE NEWS PANEL COVERED THE SUMMIT. I WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO THE MENU NOT BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY BUT BECAUSE TYPICALLY THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASES THIS KIND OF DETAILS AFTER FOR EXAMPLE THE FRENCH PRESIDENT COMES TO THE WHITE HOUSE OR ANOTHER HEAD OF STATE COMES FOR A STATE VISIT. SO BY RELEASING THE DETAILS OF THE MENU, THIS IS A LEGITIMIZING KIM JONG UN. ONE PARTICULAR THING, THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE, IF THEY KNEW WHAT WAS BEING DISHED OUT THERE, THEY CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE TYPES OF FOODS THAT YOU HAVE ROLLED OFF OF YOUR TONGUE. RIGHT. IT'S A POOR COUNTRY, BECAUSE OF KIM JONG UN, HIMSELF AND HIS COUNTRY. BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, BEEF SHORT RIBS, A COMBINATION OF CRISPY PORK, I MEAN, THAT IS IT SOUNDS REALLY YUMMY AND VERY EXPENSIVE. IT SOUNDS YUMMY AND EXPENSIVE. THAT'S NEWS? AND OF COURSE, THAT'S ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. AND SOME IT IS NOT A MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT. THE SPECTACLE OF SEEING THIS AMERICAN FLAGS IS REALLY JARRING ACTUALLY TO SEE AND WITNESS. IN FACT I WOULD SAY IT'S SOMEWHAT DISGUSTING AND IT'S A DEBASEMENT OF THE AMERICAN FLAG. THIS IS A DESPOTIC REGIME THAT MURDERS ITS OWN CITIZENS AND SO WE ARE PUTTING THEM ON THE SAME STAGE AS THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD IT'S NOT REALIZING THAT COUNTRIES HAVE INTEREST. KIM JONG UN DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF HIS NATION AND HIS OWN PERSONAL INTEREST AND HE SNICKERED DONALD TRUMP. HE MAY BE OKAY IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS BUT IT'S ODIOUS AND DISGUSTING WHEN HE'S FAWNING OVER ONE OF THE MOST VICIOUS DICTATORS ON THE PLANET. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLL, THE LESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA. THE LESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES AT HOME. Tucker: THIS HATRED CLEARLY BORDERS ON PSYCHOSIS. EVERY ANCHOR WOULD BE HERE 24/7 AND THEY WOULD ALL BE THEY WOULD TRAVEL 50 HOURS IN THE AIR FOR THAT. BY THE WAY, YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON MSNBC. THEY WEREN'T HERE. RACHEL MADDOW, CHRIS HAYES, JOLIE MIKA? TOO LONG ON THE PLANE FOR YOU. PLUS IT DOESN'T FIT YOUR FAULTS NARRATIVE, YOUR CARICATURE AND THE LIES YOU MANUFACTURE EVERY SINGLE DAY. MEANWHILE, THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PUSH FOR PEACE IN NORTH KOREA A FEW YEARS AGO, THEY WERE STEPPING ALL OVER THEMSELVES TO PRAISE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS HORRIBLY FLAWED AND DEFUNCT IRANIAN DEAL, WHICH IS THE DUMBEST DEAL IN WORLD HISTORY. $150 BILLION TO RADICAL MULLAHS IN IRAN, AND CHANTING DEATH TO AMERICA, DEATH TO ISRAEL? IT DOESN'T GET ANY DUMBER THAN THIS. BUT THEY ALL IN THE MEDIA LOVE IT. TAKE A LOOK. OF THE U.S. AND WORLD POWER IS REACHING A MAJOR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN. WATCHING ONE OF OUR BIGGEST RIVALS FROM DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO DELIVER A STATEMENT ON THIS HISTORIC NUCLEAR DEAL REACHED WITH IRAN OVERNIGHT. DISAGREEMENT IS SUPPOSED TO FREEZE THAT COUNTRY'S PURSUIT OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON. HAS THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES SUCCESSFULLY BLOCKED THE NUCLEAR BOMB FOR NOW? I THINK IT BEGINS TO CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF A TENSE RELATIONSHIP OF 36 YEARS BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND TEHRAN. I THINK THE DEAL PROVIDES MORE THAN THE UNITED STATES ANTICIPATED AND IT COULD PREVENT AN ARMS RACE IN THE REGION THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO NOT JUST OF THE LEAST BUT THE WHOLE WORLD. Tucker: IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ALL HAD THAT CHRIS MATTHEWS THRILL RUNNING UP AND DOWN HER LEG. OBVIOUSLY THIS MEDIA IS INCAPABLE OF COVERING THIS PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IN ANY FAIR AND UNBIASED WAY. AND IN THAT SENSE, HIS SUCCESS WAS THEIR FAILURE. HE WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THEY WERE WRONG. IN DOING SO, IF THEY WERE CORRECT, THE WORLD WOULD BE LEFT FAITH. SO FAR, BETTING AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT BEEN WORKING OUT PARTICULARLY WELL FOR ANY OF THEM. THEY ARE GETTING EVERYTHING WRONG. MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO START ASKING THEMSELVES, WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND MAYBE THEY SHOULD JUST KEEP PUSHING THEIR RADICAL LEFTIST AGENDA. TRUMP WOULD BE AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER. LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN, AND AS WE POINTED OUT MANY TIMES THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE ON THE ECONOMY. THEY GENERATED WEALTH LIKE NEVER BEFORE AND THAT IS WHY TONIGHT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT PROGRESS WILL HAPPEN ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY AND GOOD FOR THE WORLD. PROGRESS MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. LOOK AT THE MAP RIGHT THERE ON YOUR SCREEN. IT MERELY TOPS 10 MILLION PEOPLE MAKING IT MORE POPULOUS THAN EVEN NEW YORK CITY. SOUL IS ONLY LOCATED 35 MILES AWAY FROM THE DMZ, WELL WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF KIM JONG UN AND ONLY MILES AWAY FROM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHO WERE TASKED WITH PROTECTING SOUTH KOREA. ONE NUCLEAR WEAPON COULD WIPE IT OFF THE FACE OF THE PLANET.
