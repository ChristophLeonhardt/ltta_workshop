1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Morning Hank, it's Tuesday. It's Question Tuesday,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,720
the day that I answer a prime number of real questions from real Nerdfighters.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,060
Let's get right to it.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,020
"What specific piece of art had a big impact on your life?"

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,860
This painting,

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,160
which opened me up to the idea that there might be some kind

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,280
of like direct form or expression for the deeply abstract

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,440
and difficult to describe problem I have inside my brain.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,200
"What's your third favorite type of rock?"

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,280
Um, Dwayne Johnson, in role,

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,500
of Gibraltar.

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
The rock of Gibraltar is my third favorite type of rock.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,740
"Any news on the Looking for Alaska series?"

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,640
Yes, my first novel Looking for Alaska is going to be adapted

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,500
into a limited series on Hulu.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,260
It's still happening; I've read the script for the first episode,

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,880
it's great and that's about all I know.

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,580
Oh, I do know one other thing which is that,

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,260
in addition to not casting movies,

20
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,900
I do not cast Hulu shows

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,320
"Favorite song by the Mountain Goats?"

22
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,460
It's always changing, but at the moment my favorite

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,500
is a song called Weekend in Western Illinois

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,120
"How do you measure success?"

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,180
What did I learn and who did it help?

26
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,380
"What are you geeking out about these days?"

27
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,720
This novel by Tommy Orange,

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,600
DoctorBenjy FM's YouTube series,

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,080
in which he is the manager of a fictional football team,

30
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I have never been so invested in a series of pixels,

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,780
and the new season of the podcast In the Dark.

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,160
"Best prime number?"

33
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,120
I've always been partial to 37.

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,920
"Hey, why don't any of your books have a prime number of chapters?"

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,160
Right so, that is an inside joke I have with myself,

36
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,440
all of my books have a number of chapters

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,600
that is equal to a prime minus one.

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,340
The Fault In Our Stars and Turtles All The Way Down

39
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,420
both have 24 chapters, 23 is prime,

40
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,500
Will Grayson, Will Grayson and An Abundance Of Katherines

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,420
both have 20 chapters, 19 is prime,

42
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,100
Paper Towns,

43
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,680
if you count the prologue, has 32 chapters,

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,800
31 is prime,

45
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,280
and Looking For Alaska has 60 chapters,

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,580
if you count the authors note,

47
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,580
59 is prime.

48
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,400
Now that I'm saying this out loud, it's a little weird.

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,580
"Wait, what other inside jokes do you have?"

50
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,580
I don't know, there's a bunch of them,

51
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,760
Books take me a long time to write

52
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,720
so I have to find a way to entertain myself,

53
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,940
like one example is that I use the word 'deadpan'

54
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,120
way too many times in Looking for Alaska

55
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,900
and so in every book since,

56
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,280
I've used it exactly once.

57
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,660
"Are you writing a new book?"

58
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,220
Sometimes, but not usually.

59
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,900
"What are your most used emojis?"

60
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,780
I'm not sure what this says about me.

61
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,600
"When does the Project For Awesome start this year?"

62
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,700
December 7th.

63
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,900
So mark your calendars

64
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,660
and block out that weekend if you can.

65
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,240
This is a question from my 4 year old kid:

66
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,500
"Can you eat light?"

67
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah,

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,420
I mean, in a round about way

69
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,360
you literally can't eat anything else.

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,780
"Why do people think pineapple pizza is bad?"

71
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,420
I wrote half an episode of my podcast,

72
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,431
The Anthropocene Reviewed,

73
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:15,960
about this - link in the Doobly Doo below.

74
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,480
But, did you know that pineapple on pizza was invented

75
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,600
in 1962 by a Greek immigrant,

76
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,760
living in Canada,

77
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,200
who was inspired by Chinese cuisine

78
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,120
to put a South American food

79
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,660
on an Italian dish?

80
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,080
Pineapple pizza is peak Anthropocene,

81
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,740
for better and for worse.

82
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,680
"What are you excited about right now?"

83
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,000
I really love making The Anthropocene Reviewed, actually.

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,540
Also I am so so excited to go on tour with Hank in September.

85
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,040
I don't know the next time we're gonna get to tour together

86
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,140
and I love it

87
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,120
so I'm just gonna try to relish it

88
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,420
Now I should say by the way that tickets are selling out in many places,

89
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,960
so now is the time to get them

90
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,060
at hankgreen.com

91
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,780
"How excited are you for AFC Wimbledon's new season?"

92
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,560
Very.

93
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,620
Also all our advertisements in the stadium are now advertisements for

94
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,060
An Absolutely Remarkable Thing,

95
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,340
so Hank, you'll definitely be reaching that coveted demographic of

96
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,820
Third Tier English football supporters.

97
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,700
And finally, "are you ever gonna win at Fortnite?"

98
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,000
Right, so I play Fortnite as a pacifist

99
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,020
over on HankGames

100
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,840
because I refuse to let the Epic Game Company turn me into a violent monster

101
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,820
and I will continue to play Fortnite as a pacifist.

102
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,120
Until. I. Win.

103
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,260
Or else, people just get bored with Fortnite,

104
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,800
and stop playing.

105
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,780
Probably that one.

106
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,720
Thanks to Tuataria, for making this

107
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,140
glorious Pizza John in Fortnite playground mode.

108
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,380
Links to everything discussed in this video

109
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,400
in the Doobly Doo below.

110
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,300
Hank, I will see you on Friday.

111
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,120
P.S.

112
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,180
If you count the intro and the outro and this,

113
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,240
it's a prime plus one.

114
00:03:34,240 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
