so since I'm constantly complaining about the constant cowardice of everybody who gets criticized for anything I am so sick of people apologizing because somebody was offended especially businesses I mean even even with Nike when I thought they did this is something that was terribly wrong by elevating Colin Kaepernick to the level of a hero he's not a hero he's a Schmo you know but I thought they were wrong but I don't think they have to apologize do it do it and take the hit stand up for yourself stand up for your beliefs I just it just drives me crazy there was a story today that the funniest comedian in America Norm Macdonald was booted from The Tonight Show because he criticized me too and listen to what he said he said it used to be 100 women can't be lying then it became one woman can't lie and then became I believe all women and then you're like what and so they canceled his appearance on The Tonight Show and and he said he said of the meet two of them the model used to be admit wrongdoing show complete contrition and then we give you a second chance now it's admit wrongdoing and you're finished and so wait it's survivors to deny deny tonight and he's absolutely right but the thing is don't apologize for it so here is a story from Australia the herald-sun they ran a cartoon by mark night cartoonist mark night of Serena Williams despicable tantrum on the court when she lost at the US Open it was bad sportsmanship it was - it was ridiculous and then to attribute it to some kind of heroic feminism are speaking out or something was absolute nonsense so they ran a funny cartoon of her jumping up and down on her racket the left has this trick that they always pull it's it's two-pronged they take your comedy seriously right so you say something comic you make a joke I make a joke about women not having the capacity for reason okay and they say you think women have that you said oh my oh you know and by the time you say eight it's a joke you know chill and it's supposed to be funny it's making as much fun of me as of women you know by the time you say that you've killed the joke so you start to be careful you start to watch what you say and of course of course whenever whenever the person is of another race specifically black people it's oh you gave me to look like a black person well you know she looks like a black there's nothing wrong with that it's a cartoon it is satire what I love about this is the paper the herald-sun came back with a a front page in which they put all their cartoons all of the skys cartoons making fun of everybody with a headline welcome to PC world this is a satire free zone what does it says if the self-appointed censors of mark Knight get their way on his Serena Williams cartoon our new politically correct life will be very dull indeed good for them for standing up for themselves I hope we start doing it here like I don't think we should ever apologize for anything we are dealing with socialists we're dealing with people who don't love the Constitution we're dealing with people who attack physically attack our congressmen who call out our people in their in restaurants and chase them down the street if we make fun of you you're gonna take it and like it pal we are not apologizing for anything
