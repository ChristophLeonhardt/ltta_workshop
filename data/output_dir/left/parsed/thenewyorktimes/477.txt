We're at a drug treatment
program in Vancouver, Canada.
Where John Pinkney is injecting
himself with
prescription grade heroin.
this program is for users 
who haven't been able to
get clean using other methods.
It has taken away the
need to have to
go out and try to get 
high all the time,
try to get money to pay for it.
That's exactly the program's
goal.
It helps minimize the
health and crime related issues
that can come with heroin
addiction.
If there's any medical
emergencies or any difficulties
they're right there to help you.
They're very polite
and courteous that way.
In 2003 Vancouver opened the
first supervised injection site
in North America.
Since then many others have
popped up to deal with the
recent increase in fatal drug
overdoses.
Here people use street heroin
while volunteers stand by ready
to help.
Critics say this approach just
enables people like John to
keep using drugs,
while advocates say it keeps
everyone safer.
I just really hope that they start 
getting more clinics out there.
Because there is a need, 
look how many people are dying.
This year alone is, I think,
the most we’ve ever had die.
And there’s no need for that,
especially in this day and age.
