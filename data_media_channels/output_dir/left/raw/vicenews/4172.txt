1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,700
— Oh!

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,100
More music!

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,600
— Uh, initial thoughts is, “Tone it, tone it, tone it...”

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,080
“Feels good, yeah!”

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,960
That's all I heard the whole time.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,040
It sounded like somebody's voice
is pitched up a little bit,

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,680
Oh, that was a girl?

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,420
— Yeah.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,180
Damn.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,600
Sounds like someone needs
to take some more estrogen.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,960
A lot of testosterone in that voice.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,340
Sounds good, though.
I like the little "Build you up..."

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,600
that was kind of cool, but...

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,380
All I heard was, "Tone it, tone it, tone it."

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,060
Um... was that Kyle?

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,631
I couldn't tell, at first I thought it was Wiz Khalifa though.

17
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:54,900
And then it was, like, from the town
of Bruce Lee and somebody else,

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,320
and I was like, "Well, Bruce Lee ain't from Pittsburgh..."

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,060
so that's what kind of gave it away, but...

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,000
Next!

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,160
I don't know who that is,
but at first I thought it was like...

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,920
something from, like,
the hidden beach compilation thing,

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,320
the kind of music, like,

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,840
they remake music in a jazzy fashion.

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,820
His voice was great.

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,520
His voice was good, it had a soulful voice.

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,600
— This is Dennis Graham,

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,800
a.k.a. Drake's dad.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,860
— Word?

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,300
A soul singer.

31
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,600
That's Drake's daddy, man.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,760
Salute Dennis Graham, man.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,880
"It was cold outside..."

34
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,780
So it's country trap music?

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,820
That shit worked, though.

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,800
That shit worked.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,140
"No swimsuit, but I'm gonna jump in..."

38
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,740
Trap should've taken over the world, man.

39
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,240
In a minute, y'all motherfuckers are gonna be, "Trap!"

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,160
Goddamn.

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,660
Well, this concludes our music meeting for today.

42
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,000
Everybody can go home now.

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:00:00,000
Shit.
