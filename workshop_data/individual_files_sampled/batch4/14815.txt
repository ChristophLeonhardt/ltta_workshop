welcome to Declassified live good morning every body how's everybody doing this morning a lot to talk about I told you guys we were gonna be talking about NATO today so much to talk about with the NATO summit oh we got a lot to talk about big big big massive wins massive wins for Donald Trump yesterday over at this NATO some massive massive wins for Donald Trump I in fact I don't even know how we're gonna handle all of this winning here in the United States I really don't I simply don't I don't know it's it's it's getting to the point where we are we're just winning too much we're just winning way way way too much good morning oh the NATO summit I'm in the right shadow by all right but let's discuss let's first discuss mmm what Trump's objective was going dude in broad strokes we're also gonna talk about a little bit later judge Brett Kavanaugh Donald Trump Supreme Court pick and how the left is hysterically trying to smear him and how stupid their attacks are he'll failed they are Henrichs to do says good evening good evening Henrik where are you calling from or or logging in from it's evening where you are cuz it's early morning here on the east coast of the US alright well let's talk about NATO alright the Trump has this NATO summit and all Trump was asking I think about how ridiculous our left is all Trump was asking was for NATO nation to stop putting about 70 to 75% of the financial burden on hey John Zealand good morning hmm Norway Henrique is from Norway aww some Norway by the way looks like a gorgeous gorgeous country friend of mine goes every year one of the places on my bucket list dying to go there Luca from Finland I love I love I love our audience the International nature of our audience loved it thank you so much for watching the truck wanted at a NATO was for NATO to not impose the financial burden but really footing the bill for 70 to 75 times 72% of NATO on the United States is pretty fair right well the left was hysterical about that then they realized that trumps position was polling very well with the American people very well with the American people shadow bytes from Tunisia so it's 12 p.m. right now Wow Ross Stubbs from Australia actually from the Netherlands this is awesome I love this and so they they the left here in the United States went hysterical and said oh my god Donald Trump is alienating all allies and allies love us under Barack Obama but they don't love us anymore under Donald Trump the world's gonna hate us America we should impeach you well Americans said well you know simple math well you know if we remember a NATO and they're members of NATO and we're contributing a lot more than they are well then they should contribute more though the Democrats backed off criticizing Trump for asking me to pay their fair share bumblebee productions Texas John Zeeland says Ashley good morning Ashley Trump is opening the world's eyes to the fake EU Germany I'm Don took the words out of my mouth that was going there so the Democrats backed off being hysterical about Trump asking us who Trump asking NATO to pay their fair share right they world by the Democrats the left here in the states backed off the new hysteria is that Donald Trump had the audacity to get tough on Germany for engaging in an oil and gas pipeline deal with Russia the nation that NATO exists to protect Europe from right I mean this is how stupid this all is NATO was created to protect Europe from a Russian invasion so Trump goes out there and he says and I'm gonna paraphrase it he basically told Merkel and other German officials in essence well it doesn't make any sense you want protection from Russia up until 30 years ago you were a satellite the eastern part of your nation was a communist Russian satellite we got rid of that Nadel exists to make sure it never happens again and you're making Russia richer that's what Germany was doing and Trump essentially said to one of the German diplomats you making Russia richer that's not a hard line on Russia stop giving Russia money because when you give somebody money and make him more powerful well the hysteria here in the States was off the charts from the left it was a massive win for Donald Trump because NATO then stepped up and said well you know what you're right we're gonna spend more money now here's a story out of the Washington Times NATO mission accomplished prompt its NATO members to spend more on defense president Trump's intense pressure on fellow NATO member countries spend more on defense paid off Thursday with countries committing to spend 33 billion this year's NATO member this year NATO members also committed to accelerating the timetable to reach the agreed-upon spending level of 2% of GDP and Trump announced that at a press conference over in Brussels but that wasn't enough JC good day from Australia JC we have the same initials I like it so the predictable left gets hysterical John Kerry the weakest Secretary of State in US history puts out this cryin statement oh my god he's insulted everybody he's insulted people and he's demean them and he's oh shut up Larry shut up somewhere James Taylor is happy you're not calling him to play concerts anymore now my favorite though the most egregious lie was from Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi put out a tweet I'm not even gonna dignify her by looking for it I'll paraphrase it and her tweet said essentially by criticizing Germany Trump is showing he's more loyal to Putin than he is to Germany now Nancy Pelosi is either a mentally challenged adult or a liar maybe both Nancy Pelosi is aligning to the American people now there are a lot of low information people and that is not an insult I say low information not because I don't think they're intelligent not because I don't think they have a grasp for the subject matter they're busy there are a lot of people out there with hectic schedules working two jobs raising families who don't have time to consume news I have to do it that's a job right I have to consume everything so I can bring you analysis I don't have you know the luxury of not consuming news but a lot of people out there you get up at 5:00 a.m. they gotta get their kids ready for school they're off to their first job they come home to their second job home they eat dinner they're exhausted they get into bed and they want to watch mindless television now I admit I'm one of those people in the evening I consume news from about 5:30 a.m. prepare for the show during the morning and when I get home I want to watch anything but news i watch forged in fire and and fast and loud and shows about race cars mindless entertainment so that all being said Nancy Pelosi understands that a good portion of America wants to be able to fundamentally trust their politicians and their mainstream media so she puts out a tweet that essentially says that by being hard on Germany Trump is being soft on Putin that he's showing more loyalty to Putin it was a lie Trump literally literally at toll Germany don't give Russia more money make Russia weaker take money away from Russia don't give them money make them poorer not richer and Nancy Pelosi lied the former Speaker of the House the Democrat majority leader in the House of Representatives one minority leader I'm sorry he's never got Minority Leader she's the ranking Democrat in house representatives the Minority Leader she's in a minority Nancy Pelosi lied to the faces of the American people that didn't have the time or the inclination at dig into the facts that's reprehensible and that's where Republican majority leadership could be calling her out it's disgraceful absolutely disgraceful what I expect no less from Queen Nancy balli and Salomon say your last name Bua Kowski did I get it right or you a cow skiers pile cow ski how dare John Kerry criticize anyone he achieved nothing made no difference to the people of the USA and drew a salary he didn't earn not to mention married a rich woman and lives off her John Kerry wasn't only the worst Secretary of State in US history I think he was the most dangerous Secretary of State in US history I think John Kerry was incredibly dangerous the Iran deal allowing Isis to proliferate and now he's seemingly throwing a temper tantrum because Donald Trump had the audacity who asked NATO to pay their fair share but even worse Trump won he won now interestingly and I'm gonna talk more about the UK and shows upcoming but Teresa may was cozy with Donald Trump he needs him he needs him he is in political peril he's in the political fight of her life she needs Donald Trump right now and it's it's left to be seen how Donald Trump is going to handle that one Andre says Trump is the greatest thing to happen in the world I pray he crushes the Soviet 2.0 while the EU next love from Norway us from Norway love it look that's exactly what Trump is doing his Trump understands that yeah that certain things are inextricably linked right your economic energy homeland national security and global security policies are all linked together in really economic security as national security and as global security and those with the most money and those with the most resources win that's why the United States is asking other nations to pay their fair share that's why Donald Trump is asking Germany not to give Russia more money that's why Donald Trump is imposing tariffs on China and that's why Donald Trump has made or will make the u.s. the largest net producer and exporter of oil by 2020 to 2023 the end of his term is all of that together makes the US and its allies much richer much more powerful and much stronger and it's as simple as that but globalist like John Kerry and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton they hate that they're hysterical Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer that whole crew they are absolutely hysterical at the thought of an exceptionally strong United States the United States that can help its allies enrich its allies make its allies more powerful stronger they don't want that they do not want that Maddox Jim I'm gonna degress for one second says I just want the Yanks to understand that London does not represent the whole of the UK it's in its own liberal bubble we do understand that Jim I was asked yesterday what I think of the UK and I said that people are amazing the government especially Sadiq Khan in London suck but Jim we have the same problem here in the u.s. we don't want the rest of the world to think that San Francisco and New York City are representative of the whole United States it's those little liberally run bubbles with their pockets a weirdo leftist people so I feel you're paying Jim and we understand it believe me we do we do uh Jerry Williams says where was it go like that comment Nancy Pelosi is a psychotic clown I couldn't agree more I think that was actually a great way to sum that up a great way to sum that up inquisitor of Texas I've been laughing my ass off ever since the presidential elections this last while has been priceless and it really has it really has because Trump is winning and he's winning by keeping campaign promises you know people always said to me the never Trump errs they were particularly moronic he's not a conservative we're principled conservative roots simple vervet is he is not a conservative he said well as policies sound pretty good he's not a conservative you don't even know what a conservative is one of them apparently a conservative is open borders a conservative means being a doormat for Democrats a conservative means drinking a little tea with your pinky out and and wearing a bowtie and and speaking very politely and when people like Nancy Pelosi or vicious you want to engage in ancillary debate like those idiots Bill Kristol and George will no rug came in and he said I there are things that are fundamentally broken so instead of going from a to Q and then back to D and around the corner to are the TNS and then going in circles I'm just going to go for me to be to fix and he did and you don't want of happening the solution always turned out to be a conservative policy he that is the story that's not being told the Liberals aren't hysterical because Donald Trump is a conservative ideologue the Liberals are hysterical because he isn't and he went into it as an objective problem solver and the solutions are all shaking out to be conservative policies as we check those boxes off that's what's terrifying the left more than anything is that you got a guy who was a New York City Democrat but he's also the world's greatest pragmatist and when you figured out how to get from A to B in the most efficient way the way that best solved the problem well the end result was a conservative policy and it works it's working the u.s. is richer Isis is decimated we're getting immigration under control with zero tolerance the policies are working the Democrats have no message going into 2020 because I don't care who you're I don't care where your emotions lie you never can argue with success you can't argue with a successful end result you just can't do it that leaves be what speevak house key Sally did I get your name right please I hope I did is in Scotland Sally thanks for joining us from Scotland beautiful beautiful place Trump is much admired here in Scotland and please don't believe the English people dislike Trump the only people who taunted the loony left I know that I know that look we were told that we're gonna be all these massive protests against Trump at NATO thousands were gonna protest travel advisories like who dozen people showed up who dozen people showed up Jim says about an American and silly enough to want to visit the UK right now that I won't see the proper UK if I limit myself to London and its outskirts well fortunately I've got friends Americans and Brits who told me the same and when I can make a trip over there I'm just so busy being on air every day but when I can make a trip over I will and believe me there are many many places I want to see outside London I want to see London anyplace by London I've been to London a beautiful city much like New York and if you can just enjoy the architecture and the art and history and ignore the loonie left well then it's a great place to visit look I think Chicago is a great city great restaurants great vibe I really enjoy Chicago I just ignore the crazy leftist and I stay out of the neighborhoods where people are killing each other Sally wants the Trump plight of Scotland I would love to see that he's got a golf course over there he's got a golf course over there I know his sons I know Don better than i jr better than I know Eric but I know they love to go over there and play as well you know sorrow donated oh and I forgot to mention as I always do cuz I get so excited to bring the show we can super chat you guys can donate a couple of bucks like Peter did Peters comment is awesome Peter by the way thanks to the donation Peloso assume you mean Pelosi equals the Living Dead I like that as wells I've got her Nancy Pelosi today make a note I've got psychotic clown and I've got the Living Dead I love it let's see I think Trump is conservative on some issues and rogue one says Trump is conservative on some issues liberal on others like any sane person yeah I think look I think that's a great analysis robe I think it's a really good analysis because he's like I said he's a doer he's a problem solver I think on social issues he leans more left cuz he doesn't care like I don't care about gay marriage quite honestly I'm libertarian on that issue so many other issues for me to solve in the world all but analyze and help try to solve that I don't really care who sleeps with him but that doesn't make me a principled conservative but not obey it I just don't care who sleeps with you I couldn't care less but um because it's just not an issue of importance to me I just don't care I do care that a Christian Baker is forced to make a cake for a gay couples wedding I don't want to see that happen but I have no problem with that gay couple marrying if the Baker doesn't want to make a cake go to another bakery just don't care I don't care if states legalize marijuana I've got a friend is a neurologist he swears one of the most brilliant physicians I know in order a surgeon a brain surgeon excuse me a brain surgeon literally he swears by the marijuana trials he's given his patients for chronic pain and and other other issues and so I've got some some very good anecdotal evidence from some brilliant people to his partners in his medical practice who engaged in these trials as well swear by it don't think I don't care about those issues hear about immigration national security the economy rhyme getting NATO in check keeping Russia and China North Korea in check you guys want to sleep together and buy a house together I couldn't care less two women want to do the same who cares wouldn't care less jaesi says Trump runs the business us the business said it's a good way of thinking yeah it is dally likes my shirt with the dancing ladies so funny and cute and it's really really comfortable it's been really hot here in South Florida yeah it's a good shirt I spent when I saw this I had to pick it up it was uh it's fun it's fun and and it's really comfortable for these hot hot and humid summer summer summer South Florida days uh the way the EU is treating my president I say leave NATO and bring our troops home yeah he'll come around they'll come around they will they will come around yes you got my name right I'm an immigrant from Maine and love president Trump Sally I've got great friends in Maine they live on Mount Desert Island and right in the town of Bar Harbor when I lived in New York I would spend every summer up there for a few weeks and pop up in the fall as well Maine is absolutely beautiful actually planning a trip up there later in the summer early in the fall for a weekend haven't seen them in a while and really miss being up there by the way the best lobster in the world coming right off the boat and I'm a lobster bet the Caribbean lobster I get down here when I scuba dive a little bit different mm-hmm all right so let's talk about these other stories I'm gonna go back to the comments so Brett Kavanaugh is nominated to the Supreme Court by Donald Trump the guy by all rights and accounts is like a saint doesn't the nicest guy in the world all right he coaches his kids basketball games his daughters he feeds the homeless yesterday there's an op-ed in the Washington Post by a woman who knows him other kids go to school together her daughter is his daughter's running classmate the woman basically says look I don't follow politics that much I don't know much about him as a judge but as a human being everyone who knows him would unanimously vote to confirm him he's the greatest guy in the world a family man and then toward the end of the story her op-ed piece in The Washington Post she says that her husband passed away a few years ago one of the hardest parts was that her daughter would have felt excluded from the daddy-daughter dance at the school and she said Brett Kavanaugh without missing a beat step right up and brings her daughter with his daughter and he dances with them both and he's her stand-in dad for that event and her games and other milestones in her life isn't just a good guy he's known as Coach K he's known as the carpool dad they can't find any dirt on this guy right so here's a story in the hill repurposed from the Washington Cavanaugh incurred tens of thousands in credit card debt fine washables Nash Washington Nationals pickets a baseball team in Washington DC report they then go on to say it goes up to $200,000 the debt because of a loan well you ready for this here's why Brett Kavanaugh incurred all that daddy's terrible terrible guy actually turns out we were wrong about him he's a horrible guy he renovated his house and he bought baseball tickets in bulk for he and his friends for the kids put him on his credit card here's Rick it's really bad you know the last paragraph of the story here's the headline again haven't all incurred tens of thousands in credit card debt buying Washington Washington Nationals tickets report Washington Post report he's reported having up to $200,000 in debt well then we find out he reported it on the disclosures for his background check to be nominated for the Supreme Court he reported this home equity loan and putting baseball tickets on his credit card but here's the best part this is literally the last paragraph in the hill story should have been the first literally the last paragraph ready last year Cavanaugh's credit card debts and loan you ready hope you're sitting down because if you thought Kavanaugh was a good guy gonna shock you credit card debts and loan appeared to be paid off what appeared to be paid off or L below the years reporting requirements meaning it was down to nothing oh and by the way this $200,000 in debt for home renovations and baseball tickets a croteau occurred over the last 10 years so he probably for the bulk of that took a home equity loan to renovate his home and space it out of a 30 years something pretty much every American homeowner does at some point when they want to update their kitchens and bathroom or paint their house and then he put a few grand on his credit card each season for baseball tickets by the way that the White House says the judges friends reimbursed him for their share of the tickets and now that he's in the running for Supreme Court he's no longer buying the season tickets who this story is exactly this headline again have a non Kurd tens of thousands in credit card debt buying Washington Nationals tickets this headline and then you scroll down to the last paragraph that says Oh buddy paid it all off and it's all fine and he he disclosed the information and everything is where it should be is exactly why we call it what do we call it big exactly why we call it fake news exactly unbelievable it's just unbelievable the baby trunk balloon is the only white baby in London without hi this is funny John Zealand says the baby Trump below does yummy white baby in London without the name Muhammad well I don't think that's true but point taken Muslim Muslim migrants are over running the UK much of Europe goolby 400 is back my favorite 16 year old conservative whose dad is a Royal Marine goalie great to see you thanks for coming back into the show today okay Ben Thompson says I'm in Sweden right now now we are gonna go back to your comments and let this go so Ben Thompson says I'm in Sweden right now and I really wanna know what you think of this these attacks on judge Cavanaugh and what you think of red Cavanaugh as a Supreme Court pick I'm

what city are you in in Sweden are you in Stockholm are you in Malmo let me know I know several cities there we're having these problems curious which one you're in let's go back Ron Pez change on zealand says Trump has changed what a conservative should be and people are walking away from the Lib tarde party they are you know I spoke at length once once yesterday and again last week with Brandon Straka raka is the the gay guy from New York City who was a Democrat for leftist he started the walk away movement it was his YouTube video that went viral really really nice guy and I mean I think the guy's awesome because he really is looking at politics the way he should not about identity I hate to even say always a gay dude that wasn't it he he says it he said look I was gay it was a New Yorker I was in the fashion industry as a hairdresser and a stylist everyone around me was rabidly liberal I just thought that's what you had to be accept but then one day I started saying moping can't be that bad with Donald Trump and what the Republicans people can't be evil and I started doing my own research is Brandon Straka the head of the walk away movement and I probably spoken to the guy for about a full hour of a half an hour to an hour at length over the last two weeks and he said I just started doing my own research my own homework comparing it to what my liberal friends believed was true because of listening to people like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and only watching CNN or MSNBC or reading Mother Jones or going in New York City dinner parties that late dinner parties then and they weren't just a little bit wrong he said they were literally completely wrong like on some issues where they thought Trump did this Trump actually did that and it was something that had it been a Democrat they would be cheering and so Brandon said basically for his own personal integrity his own a personal code really he didn't want to live a lie anymore he didn't want to live a lie and you saw what happened to him he recently went to a dorama very large camera store in New York City how about I order from them online I'm a little bit of I play with photography a little bit and an employee at Adorama recognized him and refused to serve him refused to help him buying some gear whatever he's buying well the owners of Adorama got wind of this they got when to the story called him apologized invited him back in and said nope that is absolutely not our policy this is one employee this has been taboo if the employee was fired this has been taken care of you're more than welcome here the businesses are now wise ending up wise ending up to the fact that a lot of conservatives out there yeah just the Obama days are over where leftist can crush your freedom of speech your freedom of thought those days are over not doing it a lot of conservatives out there and businesses are not giving in you saw what happened at the Red Hen restaurant when they kicked out Sarah Huckabee Sanders the place is pretty much out of business the woman who owned the place had to step down off the local Chamber of Commerce then that was that bookstore in Richmond Virginia where Steve Bannon was harassed by a woman while the owner of the bookstore threatened to call the police on the woman and issued a statement saying no no no we threatened to call the police when she refused to leave she stopped harassing she wouldn't stop harassing Bannon this is a bookstore it's about an exchange of ideas he Bannon wasn't bothering anybody he was quietly looking at books he was our customer we are not gonna tolerate this and you know what business at that bookstore got better the red hens business is suffering when you don't suppress speech when you defend it when you defend freedom of expression when you're a bookstore owner that says we're a bookstore my personal politics don't matter we exist so people can learn and share their thoughts we don't care what your political affiliation we want you in here I'm debating from polar opposite sides of the issue we want you buying our books and learning it for business booms people say yep good guy right good business I want to send my money there and so this this leftist really ideological terror we lived under during the Obama administration those days are gone those days are long gone Wow get a lot of comments today guys awesome let's see where were we were we don't forget there's a Sadiq Khan counter balloon and pro-trump rally on Saturday but the BBC won't tell you that yeah I heard about that I was actually talking about that with somebody yesterday looks like the the Khan balloon already has like 40,000 dollars funded and more was coming in more was coming in let's see I've got a lot of comments here okay a cool really hoping Trump kudex solid Faraj and the baton of you Kip and Sir Boris instead of wasting time on Mather a motor well a lot of moving parts in that one a lot of moving parts in that one Robert Jackson said earning money I can't donate at the moment but I shared your feet on Facebook hope your stream grows Robert more than enough thanks for doing that that is really great support but not appreciate it more special mentioned that's and I really appreciate it and your comments over the last couple of days of an exceptional Robert as well King James says Bush Republicans do not want Trump to succeed Senator John McCain delivered the fake dossier to FBI yes on both counts and they don't want it to ski because John McCain admitted as much in a tweet a couple of weeks ago he's a globalist he believes Americans are globalist they are not John McCain is a dinosaur the iron wolverine good morning to you as well John Ziemann says the Canadian fake press are starting to turn the shiny phony overnight oh yeah they're gonna do that they're gonna do that but again the results are there the results are there and there's nothing you can do results speak for themselves the NATO nations are stepping up they committed to 33 billion more trim Skinner 777 got to address this again having awe as an SCS member along with his wife SCS is not a secret society it's a pay scale in the US government please people please stop believing these conspiracy theory lunatic sites one of my best friends on the planet the most conservative guy you'll ever meet ideologically one of us is SES all it means is he's been a federal agent in the same agency for 27 years was promoted to responsibilities above the GS pay scale and he goes into the SES pay scale it just means your executive level management it just stands for the senior executive service your pay goes from about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year to about a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year you manage more people that's it that's it you're not inducted into a secret society you're not given a secret tattoo or a brand there's no secret ceremony you just get more money in your paycheck and you get a promotion we need to stop with this SES federal judges our SES because of the salary that's all it is the information these conspiracy sites and this.q non non sizzle is giving you is really terrible terrible information it's terrible information Donald Trump is SES are you aware that Donald Trump is SES the PPM there are people in the white house who you like they are SES general Flynn friend of mine would have been SES as he static stated National Security Council it's just a pay scale for the most senior people in the government that's all SES is it is not a secret society where people get together in dark rooms and plot the demise of the world and and these sites that tell you it is they're doing you a tremendous disservice a tremendous disservice James farmer says good morning Ron Baggett says read wave in November bumblebee productions donated is super chat Thank You bumblebee says keep up the awesome broadcast oh I love doing this of course I'm gonna keep it up I love bringing this to you we're gonna grow the show and every day I'm noticing our numbers grow a little bit a little bit we wanted to work out the kinks so we're gonna start marketing it more heavily romp gee Graham says Trump doesn't take away two salary no he donates his salary every quarter to other programs in the United States but he's still paid at the SES level senior executive services all it means just management because if you're a gs-15 which would be equivalent say in the FBI or the or the DEA that would be equivalent to like a lieutenant or a captain in a police department well somebody's got to be above you and the government scale ends at 15 so you go to SES that's all it is that's all it is different pay scale it's a different pay scale so that's it and I I liked the here's the thing I don't expect most people to know those kinds there's no reason for you to I worked in side government I also analyzed it every day so these are things I'm supposed to know and those that try to make you think that SES is a secret society or this moron character you and on knows something they don't they're doing you a tremendous tremendous disservice remember if all anybody is ever telling you is what you want to hear dances are they're not real this Qi on nonsense tells people what they want to hear that's how the world works you've got to be disappointed not everything is gonna work out the way you want it to there is not some cabal going on where robert muller and trump this bump in the middle of the night and jeff sessions comes in with a big file the silent assassin and Rosenstein comes to another door and they all sit down and go okay here's how were taken down hillary and nobody sees it coming boys it's not happening guys girls it's not happening I hate to burst your bubble it's not happening general Flynn is really being maliciously prosecuted I'm a friend of the Flynn family I speak to them often Mike Flynn the son is a good friend of mine the general and I speak the man is being maliciously prosecuted I speak to people inside DOJ I love the president if sessions is m.i.a he's checked out we have no Attorney General right now give no Attorney General right now rod Rosenstein is running the oj appears maliciously a lot of things here don't add up you got to listen to the people telling you the truth me humph it and over at Judicial Watch Andrew McCarthy over at national review I'm typically not a fan of National Review and the McCarthy is the exception he does an amazing job with his analyses over there listen to these people they're telling you what's really happening not fictional characters on the internet who who are doing really what Nancy Pelosi does like I talked about at the top of the show they're relying on people who aren't gaining their own gleaning their own information obtaining their own information telling them what they want to hear and those people are running with it as truth it's exactly what Nancy Pelosi is doing to the left that's what the cue and ions and these other conspiracy theorists are doing to the right that's what they're doing to the right and let's see Brian London says Andy is brilliant about Andy McCarthy he really is one of my favorite legal analyst Brian I think he is absolutely outstanding not only is he outstanding he looks at it through the lens of a non-emotional brilliant prosecutor and he understands Criminal Procedure arguably better than most anybody and I really I think that a hundred or so analyses of his I read over the last year year and a half he's only been about 40% wrong on one I mean his success rate is like 99.999999% you can take Andy McCarthy was really wrong he made a missed call on on one ruling on emotion I mean the guy literally is about a hundred percent accuracy 100% accuracy and 777 is saying this again and I'm going to only reiterate what I said because I need people to leave this show with good in for me the past three administration's used SES to take control of the government not all are bad but most doesn't work that way a DEA person who's paid as SES probably doesn't know the FBI person has paid as SES it's not like everybody who's SES gets an email it's a pay scale all it is you really you guys are really not understanding this anybody at the head of any agency is SES Jeff sessions who many of you believe through queue is a white night a silent assassin he's SES it just means senior executive service I get very frustrated very frustrated with the amount of terrible information being imparted and I care about my audience Robert Jackson asked a good question why do you bring ben shapiro takes every chance he can to dig at the president do you think he's a rhino let me say this I don't agree with Ben on the president I don't agree with Ben on some of the dings because I think the right has to be sometimes as galvanized as the left and sometimes we can't afford to be objective we've got to fight like they do that all said Ben gets a bad cake sometimes people think he's obnoxious or ruder I've been nothing but nice personal interactions of ben shapiro we don't agree we've gone at it on twitter a little bit but every time I've ever been in a room with Bennie's been nothing but up i sky to me me to him we've had nice conversation kurt Schlichter who has a show here on the rebel one of my very very close friends he and Ben are good friends Kurt is actually Ben's lawyer Kurt represented Ben Shapiro in the suit against clock boy remember nice clock Ahmed during the Obama administration Ben Shapiro was sued by the kid for calling him out hurt one that suit and then Kurt and Ben's legal team down in Texas just won the appeal uh so you know Ben Ben and I have mutual friends I I disagree with him politically on his criticism to the president I disagreed with his never Trump positions but never been a bad guy to me quite frankly guys always been a really nice guy to me and I vote nothing a good experience with him let's see let's see I think Trump is only me somebody said they don't like sleeve tats I will tell you this so everything on here has meaning this has to do with my time in NYPD and 9/11 it's not done just to be done I think Trump is only one even Mays so he could have tea with the Queen and that out of respect for his British mother well no I think he's got to meet with hey because for the UK and near the UK and where the US and we've been great allies a couple of hundred years now so I think he's got no choice hmm let's say where are we miss Lipp pigs little pigs as I watched you JW meaning judicial watch a lot yes hmm Lawrence Hopkins interesting point the Electoral College is the only way to live in vote in a free in a society of free men and women especially with voter fraud I agree and if you see what's going on now and we're gonna talk about this a lot more on tomorrow's show gerrymandering redistricting who pushed more congressional seats the Democrats I'll go in-depth and explain but the guy leading that charge is Eric Holder the former attorney general he's the the lead lawyer on many B's gerrymandering lawsuit seen around the country of course enabled by Barack Obama and the money Obama's bring into this hole and so 777 Shoji graham says 777 is speaking of those people let's stay around longer than the administration then keep the agenda going I agree with that that's the deep state however most of those people are not SES their GS 14s and 15s SES typically come and go with the administration's except for those more operational people this senior SES people typically come and go with new administration so of anything if you understood the true nature of SES you'd know that they're the most expendable in government your deep state our guys like Peter struck who's not SES he's a GS 14 or 15 the guy that can't be fired that's in the regular government pay scale that's Doug in that has all the top secret intelligent see if people really understood the way it worked they understood the terrible information they're getting from the conspiracy theorists who want to say things that sound sensational but aren't rooted in fact and I'm glad you brought that point up Jay because it I wouldn't have really thought to explain it in that way loke 707 says there was a time that I would research outlandish claim outlandish claims made by leftist online then they turned out to be flat-out lies on misrepresentations of the truth lenita every time I don't anymore but you got to also research the outlandish claims of conservatives and conspiracy theorists you got to do that because you're gonna find the same thing shakes out in the end um let's see what else we got here they took John Dylan says bench beer on Kurt Schlichter took the hands off clock boy yeah yeah Richard Driscoll's had quoted Trump we're gonna win so much who get sick of winning well that's the one place that I disagree with the president I'm never gonna get sick of this much winning I'm not his own son said that actually I was uh I don't event with Don jr. and he got on stage and he goes I disagree with one thing my dad said I really disagree with him he was wrong that I was gonna get sick of winning and I think most Americans would agree that's the one time Donald Trump was wrong one of the few times we will never get sick of winning YouTube and Facebook are funding their own branded news what do I know about this not so sure if they're funding it on branded news I saw that YouTube is putting about twenty five million dollars into trying to combat fake news and a vetting story so clearly we know that they're gonna call left-leaning news real news and right-leaning news fake news you're smart enough to do your own research I'm not worried about that let's see what else we've got here ghouls in the graveyard says I love Metallica I really like Metallica as well good comment yeah stormy oh yeah this is good yeah John Zeeland says stormy got pinched for groping an undercover cop yeah stormy Daniels got arrest it at a strip club in Ohio for getting a little too handsy with an undercover cop or lawyer Michael avenatti is crying about it I treated it Michael avenatti this morning people arrested because of Michael avenatti seeking attention for me Daniel's one Michael Cohen zero hashtag winning how the guy out of that hashtag but yeah that's great and that is why Lawrence Hopkins says that is why their status needs to change maybe 10-year terms for upper management government employees no no need for that somebody should be able to have a job they're not a term they're just an employee if I applied who was before I left BMI PD and decided to go into the private sector I was I had offers to go into the next phase for the Secret Service and the u.s. marshals now if I had chosen down those career paths and rose to upper level management deputy director why should my career have been limited why because of some conspiracy theorists thinking that my pay scale meant I was part of a secret society so I appreciate your comment but no I think somebody that might my very good friend whose SES in a federal law enforcement agency DEA he's been there 27 years but everything right most patriotic conservative guy I know why should his career be limited he's gonna retire in about a year or so he's just done but he wants to retire and relax but he should be able to go there well right appointed but appointed positions typically leave with the administration so if you're an appointed position Lawrence you're you're wouldn't leave the administration anyway the next person coming in either has to reappoint you or you're out or you're out yeah G Grahams his facebook pledges ninety million of that fake me they're gonna do the same no but we knew about that we knew about that on the topic of the mainstream media seeing this by felix coat on the topic of the mainstream media seeing their stories boosted on youtube fee the only thing i see happening here is them disabling their comments for 5 minutes as they get hammered for lying yeah I like that each student guy how do I feel about Trump's obsession with Ivy League graduates he is he's impressed with Ivy League graduates what are you gonna do look people are products of their own experiences and successes clearly over his 40 years in business Ivy League graduates served him well they made him a very rich man he knows what he knows well I think they're always the best at what they do know I don't I think people that have gone in on a big schools are often very hungry very aggressive not as they don't have that sense of elitism but the guy won the election his call it's his call yeah I'm Wolverine says nice tattoos what do they mean well up here is my version of the Gadsden flag don't tread on me a big Second Amendment supporter this is a little tribute to 9/11 and capitalism in America that's the thievius is would normally be the serial number on a bill but it's the date nine eleven oh one the number of people killed this is my old and my PD shield names of a couple of friends that were killed that day so everything I have here is meaning this says fortune favors the bold for other reasons pretended my time in the NYPD so everything I do has an actual reason why it's permanently on my arm uh King James says respectfully sir I do agree that SES the pay scale however originally President Carter used SES to allow private industry experts into government by the federal government operate better sure but if you want to bring in top talent you gotta pay them you got to pay them you can't expect somebody to come and work for the Department of Treasury somebody who is very successful at an investment bank who can solve problems who work for peanuts which is unfortunately what government pays I have no problem with those pay scales I have nope no miracle do I believe the 911 official story yes I do you saying that's weak again you're listening I'm gonna say this and I don't mean to insult you I'm glad you're watching you're listening to more on conspiracy theorists I was in New York that day I had friends die that day the official story is the real story but again idiots idiots I'm gonna calm an idiot like Alex Jones insulted the victims they insulted the dead innocence and the dead first responders I have zero tolerance for 9/11 conspiracy theory I have zero tolerance for Sandy Hook conspiracy theories I walked through too many crime scenes I know too many of the people I was downtown on 9/11 I stepped out of my building I watched the plane hit then I watched a second plane hit I was not even half a mile north oh yeah yeah the official story is the real story uh 777 you really don't understand how SES works you really don't you're saying SES doctrines were changed by the Obama administration allowing members to be installed without coming through the ranks and without background checks simply not true you've never had to come up through the ranks who be appointed for example the administrator of DEA is an appointed official former congressman ASA Hutchinson was a great DEA administrator he was appointed he didn't come up through the ranks of DEA he eventually went through his background check but he had his congressional non-disclosure agreements you got you're getting very very bad information on how this all works and I can do a whole show one day on it right who mas natok Brandt deep state has always been permanent staff I only got the GS 12 and had no secret tattoo and they society has her and David Menzies exactly thank you thank you thank you and let me tell you what he has 12 GS 13s they're doing some of the best work out there those are the street agents they're great Oh God seven seven seven stop with building seven please I'm not going to engage in 9/11 conspiracy theories I'm not they're ignorant they're stupid and anybody who's spewing them to you doesn't deserve to have a broadcast voice it's disgraceful and disrespectful and I really encourage you I really encourage you I really encourage it but to do some real research as Rosie O'Donnell believes 9/11 was an inside job as well you want to be in the same league as Rosie O'Donnell yeah I don't I don't this is a let's say Richard Driscoll is telling people yeah see I just don't deal guys I don't deal in conspiracy theories because I've lived in the real world at least one of the worst areas in New York City for many many years the truth is usually far more brutal far more dangerous and far more disappointing conspiracy theories are great theories that tell you what you want to hear either alleviate your frustration this is the case with Russia Gate Obama gate or to explain something very tragic because you don't want to believe the reality and the people that spew them the Alex Jones's who have gotten very rich lying and spewing conspiracy theories making up things about 9/11 and I say lying because I've watched Alec Jones say that this is a a Russian airbase in upstate New York and friends of mine and I laughs arm butts off because my girlfriend I had in college her family lived down the block from well Malaya a couple miles away it's rural area from that facility it's just an old airplane junkyard and Alex Jones was was knew that he knew that and he was flat-out telling his audience factually untrue things it's terrible it's terrible people saying Sandy Hook was a conspiracy theory an inside job there are crisis actors kids weren't killed it's disgraceful I know two of the troopers that went into that school they'll never be the same with what they saw it's so terrible so disgraceful to push these conspiracy theory horrible horrible horrible really let's see what else we got here we have a lot of comments coming in a lot of comments coming in Robert says he hates that I'm closed off to 911 questions I'm not I'm not but friends of mine were in the building's my former partner was one of the detectives tasked with escorting the structural engineers you guys really you're getting your information from thousands of miles away in years later I'm literally mine came from Ground Zero being downtown you guys need to start listening to the people who were there and stop listening to morons who were a thousand miles away trying to profit off the tragedy of the tragedy this is one that I think very personally it gets me really upset right and mrs. little pig says we all be with tragic events in different ways and we do and we do and we do yep Trump is arriving in the UK huh Ben Thompson wants me to shout out to be extending from missing the gym Dave go to the gym I try to make it every day even with a busy schedule it's worth it you feel better it feel better let's see no invite to get on livestream yeah we're gonna start pushing those out on Facebook believe it or not Facebook has been I spoke to one of the powers that be over at the rebel yesterday and he said Facebook has actually been blocking our ads for the show for the show let's say this is uh I love no am I love reading your tweets your comments because you're just factually wrong again you're getting your information from people that were not there people that don't understand what happened on now John Zeeland why isn't greenpeace protesting the russian pipeline of germany isn't that funny because they know russell sink their ship a Rainbow Warrior go right down if they get nauseous face there was a great video of uh it was presumed to be a UK soccer fan jumping on a Russian police car wasn't the UK UK cops beat the Russian police beat the hell out of that guy beat the hell out of that guy and now the conspiracy theories are coming fast and furiously and I just guys I'm sorry I don't entertain them I don't entertain them because all the things you're saying were gleaned off conspiracy sites not the real Robert Jackson says he want to hear my explanation of building seven do you understand the amount of kinetic energy that was released when the towers came down its rudimentary engineering rudimentary engineering i sat in one of the court hearings when I lived in New York where structural engineers from around the world explained it but you by all means listen Alex Jones PhD professor Alex Jones yep and it's really the last i'll say on that because i won't engage in conspiracy theories but i do want to I do want to give you good information I want to give you good information but it's very very sad that so many still believe nutty conspiracy theories and it's really sad that people make money off of them it's really tragic that people make money off of conspiracy theory it's it's terrible and that's why but look it's happening now it's see we're seeing it what we talked about earlier in the show a judge Cavanaugh is confirmation he bought baseball tickets therefore he must be a credit card deadbeat we're seeing it with Trump in NATO he wants us in World War three Trump saying taking a hard line on Germany buying oil from NATO buying oil from NATO is actually him going soft buying oil from Russia is him going soft on no not conspiracy theories sound great the Jeff Sessions a silent assassin is gonna take down Hillary Clinton but sadly it's just not gonna happen it's just not gonna happen there is no there is typically things are what they are things are what they are 9/11 wasn't an inside job you know the SES is not a secret society you have sessions and Robert Miller don't fist bump in the night secretly plotting to take down Hillary Clinton general Flynn is not gonna be cleared of all charges and Hillary arrested in the courtroom no it's not gonna happen guys I try to bring you the facts if you don't want them well that's another thing entirely I love that you watch I'll debate you all day I'll debate you all day all day long but I've said but I'm gonna say on 911 I'm not gonna go into that anymore you lied I stopped entertaining those conspiracy theories years ago but we had enough comments on that that I yeah I I felt it warranted cuz I did bring it up with my tattoo to get into it but I do research for and I talk to sources and we you know try to give you the best information we thoroughly vet our editorial here at the rebel so if you know there are sites out there that don't there are people out there that'll just say anything that sounds good that's on me I'll never do it I've never been that guy I'll never be that guy I care far too much about my own integrity or too much about the brand here at the rebel that I that I work for I'll never ever be I'll never be that guy who tells you what sounds good I'm gonna give you the truth even if it doesn't and I'm gonna be doing that for you tomorrow morning at 7:30 right here on Declassified live here on the rebels youtube channel tune in cannot wait to see you guys tomorrow I have so much fun doing t-then you
