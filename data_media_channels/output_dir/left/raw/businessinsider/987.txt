00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,360
gotten more effective at restricting the

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,950
supply of prescription opiates and

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,660
driven up the price that that's just

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,050
driven people to heroin I agree with

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,880
every word of that sense except just

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's an accident that</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of initiation speak then went</font>

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,060
down I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some people for</font>

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,160
whom those prescription opiates were a

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,609
an irreplaceable stepping stones to open

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,010
use they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna start sticking a</font>

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,470
needle in their arm we're buying a

glassine bag<font color="#E5E5E5"> e full of something from</font>

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,680
some guy in a dark alley but when their

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,690
friends said oh yeah I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got some /</font>

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,860
cadets here are happy to take one and

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,200
that was relatively safe you know unless

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,670
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> control the lost control your habit</font>

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,910
taking put one broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> at one evening on</font>

21
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,649
so and then people<font color="#E5E5E5"> got strung out on the</font>

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,250
prescription drugs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trade it</font>

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,289
down to heroin because for essentially

24
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,349
unrelated reasons over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period</font>

25
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place of heroines been collapsing</font>

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,280
when I got into this business ten years

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago milligram of heroin on the street</font>

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,950
costs about two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half dollars and</font>

29
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,979
that was nineteen seventy nine dollars

30
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,740
that numbers now<font color="#CCCCCC"> 25 cents Wow so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,360
was so that's not just a ninety percent

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,710
class because the inflation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

33
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,180
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ninety-seven percent collapse</font>

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,570
it's it's absurd yeah and and and so

35
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,159
when when mr. Trump said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that drugs now</font>

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost less to the candy bar that's not</font>

37
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,250
entirely untrue because five milligrams

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,549
of heroin if you're a naive user<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lenti</font>

39
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,950
for an afternoon and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dollar a</font>

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:00:00,000
hoarders worth
