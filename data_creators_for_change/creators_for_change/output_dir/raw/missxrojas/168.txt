00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,960
some sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're staying up until 2am</font>

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,780
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then waking up at 6am so that you</font>

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,269
can work<font color="#E5E5E5"> your socks off even more you</font>

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,610
are literally just doing voluntary work

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,260
time constantly and getting to school

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,090
early so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can work loads and just</font>

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">working all the time I am in awe of your</font>

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,090
work ethic but nothing is worth burning

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,769
yourself out for which you're probably

11
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,109
going to do if you stay down this track

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,740
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all part of feeling</font>

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,600
like you're not good enough this<font color="#E5E5E5"> school</font>

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your friends or for your own</font>

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,629
sky-high expectations and but you are

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,879
enough and there are so many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,010
look out for you and you love you if

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,230
you're 13 right now you're going to have

19
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,629
a pretty difficult year and some of the

20
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:49,950
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thought your friends are</font>

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,149
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write mean things about your</font>

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,070
line but you get through it because

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,750
you're strong because you realize you

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,160
have other friends who treat you well

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,620
and because you demand respect for

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,329
yourself and because you have your

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,829
friends online who are there for you

28
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,680
there is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> power in online community</font>

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,680
there is great power in enthusiasm there

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,510
is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> power and being able to find</font>

31
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,909
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express yourself and say what</font>

32
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you actually feel so please don't be</font>

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,009
ashamed of any of that and I'll tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,689
a secret that probably breaks all the

35
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,700
rules of time travel when your friends

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,799
find out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your vlog down the line</font>

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,229
they think it's really cool and they

38
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,450
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start one too so there we go</font>

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,479
like it all turned out okay lastly drink

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,970
lots of water eat your greens and don't

41
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,590
subscribe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that in order to</font>

42
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,229
look good or fit in or exercise some

43
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,970
sort of control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over your life you have</font>

44
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,650
to deny yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your body</font>
