our air shows anti-refugee that would appear to be the latest narrative being harbored by those who have a hate on for the military well this past weekend the Canadian International Air Show took place in Toronto from spectacular formation flying two vintage flying machines hey what's not to love well a friend pass along a tweet about the airshow the author complained that loud military jets taking part in aerobatics might be triggering for Refugees oh dear we can't have that indeed this would seem to be the latest anti airshow tactic from those progressives who hate these things case in point check out this column from four years ago penned by the now thankfully retired Joe Fiorito of the Toronto Star the headline tells you all you need to know folks quote it's time to end the celebration of death and kill the air show end quote and here's some of Joe's pithy prose quote please spare me my neighbors and anyone sensible from being smothered in smoke and noise this is the sort of stuff that appeals to teenage boys or those who suffer from Arrested Development but it sort of proves my point the air show is not so much about flight prowess as it is about scaring the Wits out of people who don't have a lot of wit to spare it also caters to the sort of people who gawk at traffic accidents or the prospect of death end quote yeah that's right Joe that's what an air show is a celebration of death as spectators get smothered in smoke what a kook and only Fiorito seems oblivious to the irony that if not for those serving in the Armed Forces the freedoms he enjoys including freedom of the press would be eradicated by those tyrants in the world who do not subscribe to such liberties but apparently Joe's industrial military complex argument well that's so 2014 since it's almost 2019 we now apparently need to be concerned about the sensitivities and sensibilities of newcomers and apparently geez don't like Gator shows but is this even true is there any kind of qualitative or quantitative research out there that would prove this point or is it strictly anecdotal or is this yet more white liberal guilt being displayed by the likes of Fiorito and his ilk but if this is supposed to be our so-called new normal now what are we to take inventory of all facets of Western culture and eradicate that which might offend newcomers regardless of they are even residing here legally for example a woman in a revealing tank top and short skirt might prove triggering to someone from an Islamist regime who believes that females should be rendered invisible via the niqab or the burqa do we now tell women to cover up especially when venturing into certain neighborhoods hey diversity is our strength after all except of course when it's not for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Loyd Menzies hey folks the bubble has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
