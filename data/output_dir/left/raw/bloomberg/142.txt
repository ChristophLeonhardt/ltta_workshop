1
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,279
my name is Mati Ventrillon and we are

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,840
in Fair Isle, Scotland.

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,820
I'm a crafter, and a knitter

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,380
I design fair isle garments and sell them online

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,200
Fair Isle is known in the world as a

6
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,220
knitting technique that involves

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,739
stranded color knitting so is basically

8
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,770
carrying two colors together in one row

9
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,370
sometimes three

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,199
It's called fair isle because it originated here in the island

11
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,269
the Shetland wool was known for being

12
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,059
one of the softest wools in the world

13
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,940
Fair Isle belongs to the Shetland Islands

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,840
the population of sheep is a lot

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,440
higher than the human population

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,740
the making of a fair isle jumper I think it can

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,500
be divided in two different processes

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,229
one is the husbandry of the animals and

19
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:28,300
then the other one is the making of the

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,690
garments. You have a flock of sheep

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,399
looking after them feeding them make

22
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,680
sure that they stay healthy so that you

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
produce a good fleece.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,090
Shearing. I found

25
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,220
that the best way to do it is by

26
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,540
allowing the sheep to rest on your legs

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,860
they become very docile and kind of

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,560
happy animals the moment that becomes

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,660
like a factory thing

30
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:03,189
the relationship changes completely

31
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,220
fleece is spread out you clean any

32
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,310
debris any grass you roll it in one

33
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,580
little bundle

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,790
then it sent out to Jameson spinning in

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,500
mainland Shetland with the Good Shepherd

36
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,320
they're sorted then they're graded

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,100
according to the quality of the wool

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,660
then they get processed get washed it

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,550
gets sort of pulled apart dyed, spun

40
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:43,760
twisted and then we get the cones

41
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,240
the cones get sent normally with the aeroplane from Tingual

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,910
into Fair Isle. I receive my yarn

43
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,100
with the plane I go and collect it and bring

44
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,040
it to my studio and then the process of

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,820
making the garment begins. It comes the

46
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,340
design stage I start printing together

47
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:12,360
colors and patterns and I create swatches

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,010
once the design is approved then we go

49
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,150
into the detailing. the Knitting process

50
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,310
starts with producing the ribs taken

51
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,230
that weave transferring it into the

52
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,200
flatbed knitting machine. I place all my

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,540
wools and then I start knitting the garment.

54
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,340
The Machine reads the solid and color.

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,050
Front, back, right sleeve, left sleeve.

56
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,850
All these panels get put together

57
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,420
the sleeves get attached by a technical

58
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,239
grafting, it creates an invisible thing

59
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,610
The seam gets sown along the slip

60
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,620
I produce the neck and then the neck gets

61
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,800
grafted into the garment.

62
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,930
Once the garment is knitted is the finishing

63
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,990
process. Trimming all the insides

64
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,450
you have to weave in the end. This is the moment

65
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,089
where I can check if there's been any

66
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,819
mistake on the weavings

67
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,400
the garment gets washed in 30 degrees temperature

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,660
put it on the stretcher and the wooly horse to dry.

69
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,980
Once it's dry it gets

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,020
pressed and labeled. It's normally wrapped in

71
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,090
brown paper parcel kind of old style

72
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,470
with a little string of wool.

73
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,710
The knitting belongs to the island. People

74
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,260
stop doing it, they leave the island and

75
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,900
someone else comes and carries on so

76
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,750
feeling that I'm continuing a tradition

77
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,930
and preserving a heritage is full of

78
00:05:07,930 --> 00:00:00,000
satisfaction
