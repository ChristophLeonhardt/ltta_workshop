I believe that the first principle of conservatism is that truth matters you know why truth matters truth matters because you have value as an individual and when I lie to you i am devaluing you as a human being taking lies as part of politics is not acceptable suggesting that lying is okay so long as it's someone on your side that is not acceptable yours valuing people who have to make a free decision on the basis of information they are given you cannot do that and see yourself as a decent human being lies are not acceptable in politics just because it's politics just because everybody else is cynical doesn't mean you have to be and just because that cynicism sometimes results in victory doesn't mean it results in ultimate victory because ultimately when you promised people things they can't deliver when you promised people things that are not delivered you end up undermining your own credibility standing out to the side saying what truth matters truth always matters and if that means that sometimes we lose that means sometimes we lose in the end the only things worth winning are the things that are based on truth and I know there's this mentality that now dominates on a certain segments of Republicans that says okay well if we have to lie here here and here in order to get the bigger truth conservatism through that will be okay that's not how it works if you have to lie here here and here in order to get conservatism through if you have to pretend to be a Democrat on nine issues in order to get that big tenth one through all you're going to end up with is those nine issues being debunked and your eventual tenth victory is going to be torn away there's what Barack Obama found out on the Left you lied about Obamacare a thousand times and now Obamacare is on the ropes and it should be and right now for publicans lie about what they're going to replace it with they're going to be on the ropes to lies do not pay off
