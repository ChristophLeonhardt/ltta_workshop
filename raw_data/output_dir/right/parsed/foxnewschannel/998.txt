ABOUT OUR FAMILY.
WE'RE PROUD OF OTTO AND MISS
HIM.
HOPEFULLY SOMETHING POSITIVE CAN
COME FROM THIS."
AND WE HAVE AMBASSADOR HERE WITH
US TO GIVE US THOUGHTS ABOUT THE
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAD TO USE
SOME FLATTERY.
WAS THAT NECESSARY TO GET THE
DIPLOMACY GOING?
>> PERHAPS A LITTLE FLATTERY CAN
GO A LONG WAY.
I THINK THE OVERALL ATMOSPHERE
OF THIS MEETING WAS POSITIVE.
THAT'S GOING TO HELP CREATE A
FAVORABLE FRAME WORK FOR TALKS.
I'M DIS APPOINT
I'M DIS APPOIN
I'M DISAPPPOIN
I'M DISAPPOOIN
I'M DISAPPOINN
I'M DISAPPOINT
I'M DISAPPOINTED
I'M DISAPPOINTED A
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABO
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT T
I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE
SUBSTANCE.
THE STATEMENTS DIDN'T ADVANCE
THE BALL AT ALL DOWN THE FIELD
ON DENUCLEARIZATION.
THE LANGUAGE IS WEAKER THAN THE
AGREEMENTS THAT THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION HAD REACHED IN
2005.
SO WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE
SCOPE, DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE
TIMING OR WHETHER THERE WILL BE
ANY VERIFICATION.
>> Sandra: DO YOU THINK --
>> WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE.
>> Sandra: YOU THINK THIS IS
JUST BECAUSE THE FIRST MEETING
AND IT WAS A CHANCE TO ESTABLISH
A RELATIONSHIP?
I KNOW SECRETARY POMPEO AND JOHN
BOLTON, NOT KNOWN TO BE DUBS,
WILL BE GOING TO NORTH KOREA AND
THIS PROVIDES THEM NOW A CHANCE
TO SAY ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO
PUT YOU TO THE TEST NOW WITH
SOME MORE SPECIFICS?
>> THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.
IT'S GOOD THAT POMPEO WILL BE
LEADING THE TALKS.
HE'S ALREADY IMMERSED IN THE
SUBJECT.
HE KNOWS WHAT IS AT STAKE.
IT'S A VERY STEEP HILL TO CLIMB,
PARTICULARLY WHEN THE NORTH
KOREANS -- DESPITE ALL THE
POLITICAL GAINS THAT THEY GOT
FROM THE MEETING, JUST MEETING
WITH THE PRESIDENT ITSELF IS A
BIG GAIN, BOOST THEIR STATUS IN
THE WORLD, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
ALMOST RECOGNIZING THEM AS A
NUCLEAR POWER, THEY COULD HAVE
GIVEN US MORE.
NOW WE HAVE TO PUT THEM TO THE
TEST EARLY.
WE HAVE TO THINK OF EARLY TESTS
THAT WOULD INVOLVE DISMANTLING,
WAR HEADS.
THAT CUT INTO THEIR CAPABILITY
TO THREATEN US.
>> Sandra: CAN I HAVE YOU LISTEN
TO SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM ON THE
GOAL GOING FORWARD.
LISTEN.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A
COMPLETE THUG AND KILLER.
I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS.
HE'S NOT A NICE MAN.
BUT HE WILL DO WHAT IS BEST FOR
HIM AND HIS INNER CIRCLE.
TRUMP HAS TO CONVINCE HIM THAT
YOU'LL BE SAFER AND MORE
PROSPEROUS BY GIVING UP YOUR
NUKES IF YOU KEEP THEM.
IT'S ABOUT KIM AND HIS REGIME.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PEOPLE.
>> Sandra: AMBASSADOR, BASED ON
YOUR EXPERTISE, I WONDER WHAT
YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT
PRESIDENT MOON HAD BEEN
INSTRUMENTAL IN MENTORING AND
ADVISING MOON BEFORE THE MEETING
AND DID THE SOUTH KOREANS END UP
WITH MORE OR LESS THAN THEY
THOUGHT THEY WOULD?
>> WELL, I HAVEN'T HEARD WHAT
PRESIDENT MOON SAID.
THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED THERE WAS
NOT A SMALL STEP FORWARD ON
DENUCLEARIZATION.
WHAT IS WORRISOME TO THE SOUTH,
THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITHOUT
COORDINATING WITH THE SOUTH
KOREANS OR WITH THE PENTAGON
THAT HE'S GOING TO SUSPEND THE
MILITARY EXERCISES, WHICH ARE
CRITICAL FOR KEEPING FORCES AT A
HIGH LEVEL OF READINESS SO THAT
WE CAN GO INTO ACTION IF THERE'S
A NORTH KOREAN AGGRESSION.
SO THAT I THINK SQUANDERED SOME
OF OUR LEVERAGE THAT POMPEO WILL
HEAD AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T
UNDERMINE THE CHANCES OF GETTING
REAL DENUCLEARIZATION.
>> Sandra: IN THE BRIEFING
BEFORE THE SUMMIT, MIKE POMPEO
SAID HE BELIEVES WE'RE ON THE
SAME PAGE AND UNDERSTAND AND
HAVE THE SAME DEFINITION OF
DENUCLEARIZATION AS THE NORTH
KOREANS.
DO YOU THINK THAT IS TRUE?
>> I'M NOT YET CONVINCED OF
THAT.
HE MAY HAVE HEARD THINGS IN
PRIVATE THAT GO WELL BEYOND THIS
JOINT STATEMENT.
BUT AT THE MOMENT, WE HAVE TO
ASSUME THEIR PREVIOUS POSITIONS
STILL HOLD AND THEY'RE NOT READY
NOR THE VERY INTRUSIVE THAT IS
NEEDED FOR THE INVENTORY AND
WITNESS THE SYSTEMATIC
DISMANTLING OF THE MISSILES, THE
NUCLEAR REACTORS, ET CETERA.
I HOPE I'M WRONG.
HE'S GOTTEN THE MESSAGE BUT HE'S
