REPORT.
>> Martha: AND WE AWAIT THE
REPORT, WHICH SHOULD COME AT ANY
MOMENT.
THE PRESIDENT GOES WHERE HE
REALLY HASN'T GONE, AT LEAST IN
THE SAGA, TAKING SOME SWINGS OF
THE CREDIBILITY OF CHRISTINE
FORD.
>> President Trump: 36 YEARS
AGO, THIS HAPPEN.
I HAD ONE BEER.
RIGHT?
I HAD ONE BEER.
WELL, YOU THINK -- NO, IT WAS
ONE BEER.
HOW DID YOU GET HOME?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
HOW DID YOU GET THERE?
I DON'T REMEMBER PEER HOW MANY
YEARS AGO WAS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
>> Martha: A LOT OF CRITICISM
FOR THAT, BUT YOU HEAR THE CROWD
IN MISSISSIPPI LAST NIGHT.
JENNA ME NOW, BEN SHAPIRO,
EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE DAILY
WIRE AND HOST OF THE BEN SHAPIRO
ELECTION SPECIAL, WHICH IS
WIDELY POPULAR.
ON THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT,
TAKING THOSE AT SWINGS AT
CHRISTINE FORD.
>> TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT
ONCE.
HE CAN BE POINTING OUT SOME REAL
HOLES IN CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S
TESTIMONY.
THE SECOND, THIS IS NOT
PRODUCTIVE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF SENATORS WHO
ARE SITTING ON THE FENCE, AND
ANY EXCUSE FOR THEM TO VOTE
AGAINST KAVANAUGH IS A MISTAKE.
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING OUT AND
DOING THIS RALLY, OBVIOUSLY
PROVIDING FODDER FOR PEOPLE ON
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO WANT
TO AVOID MAKING THE HARD CHOICE
ABOUT KAVANAUGH.
INSTEAD, HOPE TO DUMP ON THE
PRESIDENT THAT I'M NOT SURE
THERE IS POLITICALLY SMART BY
THE PRESIDENT.
I AM NOT A FAN OF HIM RIPPING
INTO FORD, PERSONALLY, BUT ARE
THERE HOLES IN HER STORY?
THAT PART HE IS RIGHT ABOUT.
>> Martha: HE ALSO RAISED THE
ISSUE OF MEN, YOUNG MEN, BOYS,
THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY ARE
IN, AND THAT PROMPTED ALYSSA
MILANO, WHO IS WE ALL REMEMBER
WAS SITTING BEHIND JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AS HE ANSWERED THE
QUESTIONS AT THE HEARING WITH A
NOTEBOOK THAT SAID "VOTE NO" ON
IT.
HERE'S WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.
"CRY ME A RIVER," BASICALLY.
WATCH THIS BEARD >> WOMEN, YOUNG
PEOPLE OF HAD IT DIFFICULT FOR
GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS AND
GENERATIONS APPEAR WE WILL NOT
BE SILENCED ANY LONGER.
IF THAT MEANS THAT MEN HAVE A
HARD TIME RIGHT NOW, THEN I'M
SORRY, THIS IS THE WAY THE
PENDULUM HAS TO SHIFT.
>> Martha: BEN?
>> I MEAN, IT IS KIND OF
SHOCKING TO SEE THAT DUE PROCESS
SHOULD NOT APPLY TO MEN.
THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF SEXISM,
THE IDEA THAT ROLES SHOULD NOT
APPLY TO PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF
THEIR GENETICS.
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY DISCRIMINATION
OF THE HIGHEST ORDER, BUT THIS
IS THE WORLD WE NOW LIVE IN,
WHITE MEN PRESUMED GUILTY
BECAUSE THEY ARE WHITE MEN,
SUPPOSEDLY IN A POSITION OF
PRIVILEGE BUT I WAS NOT AWARE
THAT KAVANAUGH FOR     FORFEITED
THAT KAVANAUGH FOR     FORFEITEH
THAT KAVANAUGH FOR     FORFEITES
RESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BECAUSE
OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN OR THE
NATURE OF HIS GENETICS.
>> Martha: IT IS A VERY
INTERESTING ARGUMENT.
YOU LOOK AT CLARENCE THOMAS
DEFENDING HIMSELF, AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN, A JUDGE
WHO WANTED TO SIT ON THE COURT.
NOW YOU HAVE BRETT KAVANAUGH IN
THIS UNIQUE POSITION, WHICH I
GUARANTEE HE NEVER THOUGHT HE
WOULD BE IN, WHERE HE IS RAISING
THE FLAG FOR WHITE MEN AND
SAYING THAT THEY, LIKE EVERYONE
ELSE, NEED TO BE TREATED ON AN
INDIVIDUAL BASIS ON THE FACTS
THAT SUPPORT THEM OR THE FACTS
THAT GO AGAINST THEM.
>> MOB RULE IS NEVER A GOOD
IDEA.
THE FACT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH
HAS BEEN TURNED INTO MERELY A
WHITE GUY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE
LEFT SEES THINGS IN TERMS OF
RACE AND SEX.
CORY BOOKER SAID THAT TODAY.
>> Martha: WE HAVE THAT.
LET'S PLAY THAT AND GET YOUR
REACTION.
GO AHEAD.
>> ULTIMATELY, NOT WHETHER HE IS
INNOCENT OR GUILTY, THIS IS NOT
A TRIAL.
BUT ULTIMATELY, ENOUGH QUESTIONS
BE RAISED THAT WE SHOULD NOT
MOVE ON TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE.
>> Martha: YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> I THINK CORY BOOKER RAISES
SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS
CANDIDACY EVERY DAY, BUT IN
ORDER TO OUST HIM FROM THE
SENATE, YOU WOULD NEED EVIDENCE,
NOT JUST THE IMPLICATION THAT HE
IS A.
>> Martha: IT IS REMARKABLE --
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE
CONSTRUCT OF HIS HEARING THAT WE
SAW, IT IS NOT A COURT OF LAW,
BUT AT THE HEART OF IT, IS THE
ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY OF THESE
TWO PEOPLE AND WHETHER OR NOT IT
WAS SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF
PROVING THAT THIS HAPPENED THAT
NIGHT.
I THINK EVEN IN THE END, YOU
WILL HAVE PEOPLE THAT FEEL
UNSATISFIED BY THE AMOUNT OF
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD TO
BASE THEIR DECISION ON.
BUT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL, AREN'T
THEY DECIDING IN THEIR MIND
WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK HE WAS
GUILTY OR INNOCENT?
>> NO QUESTION.
THE IDEA THAT THIS IS JUST A JOB
INTERVIEW SO IF YOU RAISE ENOUGH
QUESTIONS THAT IS ENOUGH, THAT
RULES OUT ANYONE WHO IS GOING TO
HAVE A JOB OFFER ON THE SENATOR
LEVEL BECAUSE IT IS NOT HARD TO
RAISE QUESTIONS.
THIS IS NOT MERELY A JOB
INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A
MAN WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
ATTEMPTED A RAPE.
IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE DOESN'T
END UP ON THE SUPREME COURT, HE
WOULD PROBABLY LOSE HIS SEAT ON
THE D.C. COURT OF APPEALS, AND
HIS FAMILY IS DESTROYED.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DESCRIBED
DECIDED TO PLAY THIS WAY.
THEY'RE TRYING TO RATCHETED UP,
OBVIOUSLY.
>> Martha: LOOKING TO THE NEXT
FEW DAYS FOR US.
YOU ALREADY FEEL, AS THIS REPORT
IS ABOUT TO COME OUT, SO MUCH
PUSHBACK FROM DEMOCRATS,
PRIMARILY AT THIS POINT, AND ALL
OF THE THINGS THEY HAVEN'T SEEN
AND HEARD.
THEY ARE PREPARING THEIR
ARGUMENT.
>> SENATOR FLAKE WAS BASICALLY
GAMBLING BY USING THIS FBI
REPORT AS THE FINAL WORD THAT
THIS IS GOING TO GET MURKOWSKI
AND COLLINS ON BOARD.
WE WILL SEE IF HE IS RIGHT OR
NOT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT COMES
DOWN TO.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF RED STATE
BLUE SENATORS WHO ARE IN TROUBLE
AND MAY NEED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF
KAVANAUGH IF THE FBI REPORT
COMES BACK AS CLEAN AS IT IS
EXPECTED TO.
THIS IS SO PARTISAN AT THIS
POINT THAT THIS GOES ALONG PARTY
LINES, UNLESS, AGAIN, ONE OF
THOSE TWO SENATORS SHOCKS US.
>> Martha: WHAT CONCERNS YOU
WANT THIS WHOLE THING?
AS HE LOOKED BACK AND GO AT THE
BIG PICTURE OF IT AND LONG TERM
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COUNTRY?
>> THE PARTISAN NATURE OF
SUPREME COURT HEARINGS HAVE BEEN
KNOWN SINCE THE BORK DAYS.
WE ARE NOW SEEING THE
WILLINGNESS TO BELIEVE IN
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT POLITICAL
OPPONENTS WITHOUT ANY SORT OF
CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE, IT
REALLY DOESN'T SPELL THE END OF
CIVILIZED SOCIETY PEER NO GOOD
PERSON IS GOING TO WANT TO GO
INTO POLITICS KNOWING THEY CAN
BE DESTROYED AT A MOMENT'S
NOTICE BY ANY ALLEGATION OF ANY
SORT BROUGHT BY ANYBODY.
THAT IS NOT EVEN SAYING THAT
FORD IS NOT CREDIBLE.
IT IS SUGGESTING YOU NEED
CORROBORATION IN ORDER TO
