congressman in the state of California San Diego area and he has been indicted for misusing campaign money to the tune of 250,000 dollars a quarter million dollars in campaign money that he and his wife has spent on nonsense and I'll give you a sense of what that nonsense is in just a second now more details are coming out as this indictment has been released and what's fascinating to me is that Duncan Hunter as a politician has a salary of close to $175,000 I'm rounding it's a hundred seventy-four thousand some change but it's that's a pretty nice chunk of change that's a lot of money and apparently wasn't enough they were living well above their means and so he had spent over $400 for 30 tequila shots at a bachelor party and countless fancy dinners he visited one of his favorite bars sometimes multiple times a day piling up thousands of dollars in tabs now this is the activity that he took part in when he was in Washington but back home homeboys driving a dented up truck you know he's he's he's looking like you know working-class cowboy you know he looks like he's you know living well below his means and then he's really a representative of the people but then he goes to Washington where actually he spent most of his time and he's drinking he's partying he's living lavishly he's got cars yeah yeah in predominantly doing this so let them break them so there's a lot of like nuggets in this story it's like an Easter egg hunt in this story my one of my favorites was when he's back home they say you know he only has two beers at a time and sneaks away to have a cigarette sometimes because he didn't wanna get caught by his wife and remember this is a guy who threw his wife under the bus like hey man now I know what I know we'll get to to it but this guy's clearly got some control issues with his wife okay let's just note that okay now moving back to Washington where he's like well party the only part of the story that that made me like him was over four hundred dollars on 32 Keeley's shots at a bachelor party hey if you could afford it and it's actually your money and not campaign money yeah I mean it was 30 shots for himself but I'm kidding it wasn't but but by the way the rest of us quote that you read does make you wonder about that because then he go like it got kind of dark he visits his favorite bars no problem sometimes multiple times a day I know Kay and then thousands of dollars in tabs yeah that doesn't sound very good but you know maybe sometimes he takes up meetings at a bar I don't know I don't know why I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt so later they talked about this private club that's very near the capital and a bunch of the congressmen go there and they hang out on the patio apparently going back multiple times a day having beers in vodka I don't know if he's got an issue in that regard but let's hope he doesn't and that he's just having a good time but he's having a good time at your expense yes he's spending the campaign money that you gave him to actually win office and to push your ideology and your principles not to spend it on tequila shots and pet rabbits and so I don't mind anybody having a good time that makes me like them but this guy is one clearly overdoing it and B most importantly doing it with your money instead of his money and that's a huge problem that is a huge problem so let me give you more details cuz it gets better so well hunter was in Washington where again he spent most of his time his wife Margaret mostly stayed in California where she managed the campaign's finances and struggled to keep up appearances with things like private school tuition all on a $174,000 a year congressman salary so I wanted to read you that little nugget from The Times because are you guys having a hard time paying for your kids private school education is that what's happening do you need bootstraps do you want me to loan you some bootstrap so you can pull your site you're making one hundred seventy four thousand dollars oh by the way I thought you were going miss surgeon that's true too but well if you're having trouble affording private tuition perhaps as a government official yeah it actually make your public schools good enough for your kids to go to yes exactly so I have absolutely no sympathy for them whatsoever like if you look at what they spent the money on they actually didn't spend the majority of this campaign money again to the tune of a quarter million dollars on insanely lavish things yes there were some examples of that but they spent that money on like groceries like average everyday things that people need so I mean and by the way they were doing this while Duncan Hunter simultaneously would talk about fiscal responsibility you know a real pick yourself up by the bootstraps type of Republican hunter showed up at an Alamo rental car agency in Reno Nevada and with his own bank accounts nearly empty he dipped into campaign funds to pay three hundred fifty one dollars and four cents for a rental car to drive to Lake Tahoe for ski weekend days later there were more charges one thousand eight dollars in 72 cents for food drinks and a room for three nights at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort Spa and Casino the longest hotel name in existence also his personal bank account at the time that he withdrew $20 had only $15 and two cents remaining like they were living well above their means now all these details are coming out what is Duncan Hunter's response blame my wife and it is pathetic let's take a look at the first video this is him on a pier any accusations against your wife yeah did that'll come out in court right I mean that's but that's for the court and for her and for me right was she in charge she was the campaign manager of the campaign yeah no wife under bus hates his wife so he did it on Fox News - he keeps suing over and over again man he he's definitely got issues with his wife it's amazing by the way he blames two different things and it is not wise to lie in two different directions at the same time if you don't want to get caught just stick with one lie so his other lie is I was a deep state the deep state run by Democrats rigged this against me plus my wife did it mmm well which one is it ya know what I love unless wait a minute I just feed her doubt mm-hmm unless his wife is the deep sea okay but no he actually thank you you know he blamed a third a third group of people Oh so remember Republicans are very Pro law enforcement they love law enforcement except when they get caught doing something bad this is par for the course this is modern politics and modern media mixed in with law enforcement that has a political agenda this is the new Department of Justice this is the Democrats arm of law enforcement that that's what's happening right now it's happening with Trump and it's happening with me they could try to have a political agenda as our law enforcement as a US government I think we've we've seen with strong and and what the FBI and the DOJ have been doing let's let them expose themselves for what they are and then that's a politically motivated group of folks if you just accused the Department of Justice of being left-wing like the Attorney General is jeff Sessions one of the most right-wing racist people in existence you're gonna accuse the DOJ of being left-wing they're pathetic no what's more pathetic unfortunately is the Republican voters and so that's the thing you'll never hear in any other part of the media because they're like oh my god we don't want to offend them what if they don't we hurt our ratings okay no we're home progressives and we're here to tell you the truth okay so now let me back it up with facts so they're perfect in his district they're perfectly aware of these scandals these charges have been pending for a long time they've just come out now but they knew about and now after the charges came out formally they pulled his district and they pulled Democrats independents and Republicans so independents have turned against them but by a narrow margin it is a conservative district Democrats obviously against them for a number of reasons but seventy-seven percent of Republicans stand by hunter okay maybe they maybe they're like Robert Jeffress the pastor who supports Donald Trump and they say look yeah he's a crook but I don't care he's my crook as long as he's pro-life and whatever and in favor of tax cuts for the rich I don't care that he steals for me okay whatever that could be no but that's not it seventy two percent say the indictment either made no difference or actually increase their support for him why would it increase your support for him oh he's a crook he he flew his pet rabbit across the country on my dime well Bravo I now support him even more yeah what kind of a schmuck would say that that's unbelievable and but do they they don't really believe those insane conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice justice and Jeff Sessions being liberals right wrongs 64% of Republicans said the charges against him are politically motivated 64% that's two-thirds of Republicans in his district that have lost their minds this is California okay so look I'm telling the rest of the media won't tell you because they're so afraid of offending Republicans two-thirds of their voters in his district are insane they think the Department of Justice run by Jeff Sessions is doing a liberal conspiracy against Duncan Hunter yeah yeah that's cuckoo for cocoa puffs by the way I mean fine the the misuse of funds included the money that you donated to his campaign so if you're comfortable with this have fun like enjoy it you'll misuse your your money to go on trips to Italy or to in and out or to buy his prescriptions or to the dentist or his cable bill or trips to Walmart he will keep sending his kids to private schools where while completely dismantling and underfunding the schools that you send your kids to enjoy I don't know what else can I say yeah there's no excuses for like so the fancy Lake Tahoe stuff like maybe you can get yourself to believe oh maybe he was doing a political fundraiser no it was just him and his family but even so there's trips to Walmart and Albertsons over and over again why because he's just like oh it turns out I could rob people who gave to my campaign and not to me that I'll just keep on robbing him for year after year after year I'll just charge everything to them suckers yeah hey you know what it turns out he was right you if you are one of his donors any one of his voters in that district you are a sucker after he stole all that money from you he turns around and say Oh was the deep state liberal conspiracy led by my wife and you moron of morons believe him so enjoy giving more money he's got hey I mean there's more trips to Tahoe and Italy to take so by the way on this great Duncan Hunter story there's two other parts that I want to tell you guys about in the postgame one is about what a Blue Falcon is I didn't know what it was we'll find out what that means and apparently he's a Blue
