AND KEEPING MORE OF YOUR HARD 
EARNED MONEY WHERE IT BELONGS, 
IN YOUR POCKET OR WHEREVER ELSE 
YOU WANT TO SPEND IT. 
 
BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER, I'D 
LIKE TO ADDRESS THE HORRIFIC 
SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE 
YESTERDAY AT CAPITAL GAZETTE 
NEWS ROOM IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND. 
THIS ATTACK SHOCKED THE 
CONSCIENCE OF OUR NATION AND 
FILLED OUR HEARTS WITH GRIEF. 
JOURNALISTS LIKE ALL AMERICANS 
SHOULD BE FREE FROM THE FEAR OF 
BEING VIOLENTLY ATTACKED WHILE 
DOING THEIR JOB. 
TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, 
THERE ARE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS 
OUR SORROW FOR YOUR LOSS. 
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE EVENT. 
HORRIBLE THING HAPPENED. 
WHEN YOU ARE SUFFERING WE 
PLEDGE OUR ETERNAL SUPPORT. 
THE SUFFERING IS SO GREAT I'VE 
SEEN SOME OF THE PEOPLE, SO 
GREAT. 
MY GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REST 
UNTIL WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING 
IN OUR POWER TO REDUCE VIOLENT 
CRIME AND TO PROTECT INNOCENT 
LIFE. 
WE WILL NOT EVER LEAVE YOUR 
SIDE SO OUR WARMEST BEST WISHES 
AND REGETS.
HORRIFIC. 
HORRIBLE THING. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>>>  TODAY'S EVENT WE ARE 
HONORED TO BE JOINED BY OUR 
GREAT VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE 
PENCE. 
STAND UP MIKE.

STEVEN WHO HAS BEEN KEEPING 
VERY BUSY LATELY. 
STEVE. 
SECRETARY WILBER ROSS, WILBER.

ASSOCIATION. 
SUNNY PURDUE, THE GREAT

SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR, 
LINDA MCMANN. 
DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
 
>> DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY. 
 
AND TREASURER JOVITA CORENZA. 
THANK YOU. 
THANKS ALSO TO A REALLY GREAT 
FRIEND OF MINE, MARYLAND 
GOVERNOR PHIL BRYANT AND ALL OF 
THE OTHER STATE, LOCAL, FEDERAL 
OFFICIALS THAT HAVE DONE SO 
MUCH TO HELP US WITH THIS 
INCREDIBLE TAX CUT AND JOB 
PLAN. 
YOU SEE HOW IT'S WORKING. 
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY I THINK 
THE CUTTING OF REGULATIONS 
MAYBE HAD JUST AS BIG AN 
IMPACT. 
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU 
BUT I THINK THE CUTTING OF 
REGULATIONS HAD JUST AS BIG AN 
IMPACT. 
I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME JUANITA 
DOUGAN, KAY JAMES AND MICHAEL 
FOR HELPING US. 
YOUR SUPPORT HAS BEEN 
INCREDIBLE IN GETTING THIS VERY 
DIFFICULT LEGISLATION TO THE 
FINISH LINE. 
PLEASE STAND UP. 
STAND UP. 
WHAT A TEAM. 
GREAT TEAM. 
 
GREAT TEAM. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHERS IN 
THE ROOM. 
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE NEVER GOING 
TO SPEAK TO ME AGAIN BUT WE ARE 
NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY MORE 
NAMES, RIGHT? 
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS 
OTHER THAN THESE NAMES WHO ARE 
THE IMPORTANT ONES, OKAY? 
WE ARE ALSO ESPECIALLY PROUD OF 
THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS WHO FOUGHT WITH US. 
WE DIDN'T GET A DEMOCRAT VOTE. 
I WANT TO THANK ROGER 
REPRESENTATIVE DIANE BLACK. 
KEVIN BRADY. 
WHAT A WARRIOR. 
KEVIN, COME ON STAND UP. 
MIKE TELLY MY FRIEND AND JASON 
SMITH OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WORKED 
NIGHT AND DAY TO SCORE THIS 
LANDMARK VICTORY. 
FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS BUT MUCH 
MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE 
COUNTRY. 
UNFORTUNATELY EVERY SINGLE 
DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE AND 
SENATE, THAT'S RIGHT, EVERY 
SINGLE ONE VOTED AGAINST LOWER 
TAXES FOR THE HARD WORKING 
AMERICANS AND YOU SEE WHAT'S 
HAPPENED. 
IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE SOMETHING 
VERY SPECIAL. 
THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT 
SLASHED INCOME TAXES ALL ACROSS 
THE BOARD. 
WE NEARLY DOUBLED THE STANDARD 
DEDUCTION AND DID DOUBLE THE 
CHILD TAX CREDIT WHICH IVANKA 
WANTED VERY MUCH I WILL TELL 
YOU. 
STAND UP IVANKA. 
STAND UP HONEY. 
>> SHE I DO NOT TELL A BIGGER 
HAND THAN THE POLITICIANS. 
THAT MEANS YOU ARE ALL IN 
TROUBLE. 
THE TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR 
EARNING $75,000 WILL SEE AN 
INCOME TAX CUT OF MORE THAN 
$2,000 AND IN SOME CASES MORE. 
SLASHING THEIR TAX BILL IN 
HALF. 
WE CUT TAXES FOR BUSINESSES OF 
ALL SIZES TO MAKE THIS THE BEST 
PLACE ON EARTH TO START A 
BUSINESS TO I AM VEST. 
WE HAVE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL 
REVENUE COMING IN. 
WE LOWERED THE CORPORATE TAX 
RATE SO THE AMERICAN WORKER 
FINALLY HAS A LEVEL PLAYING 
FIELD. 
WE ALLOWED COMPANIES TO DEDUCT 
EVERY SINGLE PENNY OF 
INVESTMENT IN NEW EQUIPMENT AND 
IT'S CALLED EXPENSING. 
IT'S THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE 
PLAN. 
I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN AS 
MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT 
ELEMENT. 
IT'S ONE YEAR EXPENSING NOBODY 
THOUGHT WE WOULD EVER SEE THAT. 
SO INCREDIBLE FOR STARTING UP A 
BUSINESS OR RUNNING A BUSINESS. 
WE GREATLY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF 
THE UNFAIR ESTATE TAX COMMONLY 
KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX. 
YOU KNOW, THAT'S SUCH A BIG 
THING AND MOST FARMS AND MOST 
SMALL BUSINESS WILL NOT PAY ANY 
STATE TAX OR DEATH TAX. 
SUCH A BIG THING. 
 
WE CREATED OPPORTUNITY ZONES TO 
PROMOTE MORE JOBS IN LOW INCOME 
COMMUNITIES. 
WE OPENED ANNURE. 
THAT'S A BIG ONE. 
 
NAH WAS ONE THAT THEY SAID NO 
PRESIDENT COULD GET IT FOR MANY 
YEARS. 
I WASN'T GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE 
I WAS ANGRY AT SOMEONE. 
I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT 
AND THEN WHEN I HEARD THAT 
RONALD REAGAN COULDN'T DO IT, 
NOBODY COULD DO IT, THEY HAVE 
BEEN TRYING FOR 50 YEARS I SAID 
OH LET'S DO THAT IMMEDIATELY. 
IT'S LIKE A CHALLENGE, RIGHT? 
A CHALLENGE. 
 
AND THEY'VE STARTED THAT 
PROCESS. 
IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING ONE 
MUCH THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD. 
PLAN WE REPEALED THE MOST I 
GUESS YOU COULD SAY UNPOPULAR 
THING I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME 
IN POLITICS OR LEGISLATION, THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ON OBAMACARE.
 
>> THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, HOW 
ABOUT THAT ONE. 
THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE THE RIDGE 
OF PAYING A FORTUNE IN ORDER TO 
NOT PAY TO HAVE BAD HEALTHCARE. 
THINK OF THAT. 
IN OTHER WORDS YOU PAY A LOT OF 
MONEY NOT TO HAVE HEALTHCARE SO 
IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD. 
WE'VE GOT NO CREDIT BUT THAT'S 
OKAY. 
SOME PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND 
SAY THEY LIKE THAT AS MUCH AS 
TAX CUTS. 
THAT'S A BIG THING. 
AND OBAMACARE IS JUST ABOUT 
OVER. 
WE HAVE COME UP WITH SO MANY 
PLANS AND WE HAVE A PLAN COMING 
OUT AN ADDITIONAL PLAN, 
SECRETARY COMING OUT IN A VERY 
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS 
GOING TO BE--I THINK IT'S GOING 
TO PERHAPS MATCH YOUR PLAN FROM 
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. 
IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING VERY 
SPECIAL. 
SIX MONTHS AFTER OUR TAX CUTS 
MORE THAN 6 MILLION WORKERS 
HAVE RECEIVED BONUSES AND REAT 
ANOTHER TIME ACCOUNT 
CONTRIBUTION. 
AND ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL 
ELEMENTS OF WHAT I DO, I LOVE 
TO SEE HAPPY FACES BUT I'LL 
STAND ON THE LINE SOMETIMES 
BEFORE OR AFTER A SPEECH AND 
I'LL BE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THAT WANT PICTURES FOR WHATEVER 
REASON THEY WANT A PICTURE OF 
ME AND I STAND WITH THE POLICE 
A LOT AND I'LL SEE A POLICE MAN 
AND IN PARTICULAR ONE IN NEW 
YORK CITY AND HE SAYS SIR I 
WANT TO THANK YOU. 
YOU MADE ME A HERO TO MY WIFE 
AND FAMILY BUT THIS YEAR MY 
401K IS UP LIKE 46%. 
MY WIFE THINKS I'M A GENIUS. 
SHE THINKS I'M THE GREATEST 
INVESTOR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
MY LIFE. 
 
>> AND YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF 
VALUE OR WORTH WE HAVE CREATED 
SEVEN STRONG DOLLARS WORTH OF 
VALUE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND 
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS. 
WE ARE ALMOST DOUBLE THE SIZE. 
CHINA IS TERRIFIC. 
WE ARE STRAIGHTENING OUT THE 
BALANCE AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE 
WANT TO SEE THAT. 
BUT WE'RE THE LARGEST ECONOMY 
IN THE WORLD BY FAR AND AS YOU 
KNOW WE'VE INCREASED A LOT OVER 
THE LAST ONE AND A HALF YEARS 
BUT WE ARE ALMOST DOUBLE THE 
SIZE OF CHINA AND FAR BIGGER 
THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND WE ARE 
GOING UP VERY RAPIDLY AND IT'S 
GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO UP VERY 
RAPIDLY. 
BIGGEST IN THE WORLD BY FAR. 
THINK OF THAT. 
WE ARE THE BIGGEST--DID YOU 
KNOW THAT? 
THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE 
WORLD BY FAR. 
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT, 
RIGHT? 
IT REALLY IS. 
IT'S PRETTY GOOD. 
AND THEY HELPED US A LITTLE BIT 
BUT EVERY LITTLE BIT COULD YOU 
UNDERSTAND. 
SO THE SHARE OF SMALL 
BUSINESSES RAISING BENEFITS AND 
PAY HAS JUST SET A NEW ALL TIME 
RECORD AND MANUFACTURING 
OPTIMISM TO ME IS SO IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT OPTIMISM 
IS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED. 
THIS IS A STATISTIC THAT'S BEEN 
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME HIGHEST 
EVER REPORTED HUNDREDS OF 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COMING BACK 
FROM OVER SEAS. 
OVER $300 BILLION WAS JUST 
REPATE RATED INTO OUR COUNTRY 
IN THE FIRST QUARTER ALONE. 
THINK OF THAT, 300 MILLION. 
MONEY WE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN. 
TRILLIONS MORE DOLLARS ARE ON 
THEIR WAY BACK AND APPLE 
ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO 
SPEND $350 BILLION. 
NOT MILLION. 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH 
THAT TOO BUT $350 BILLION IS 
BEING BROUGHT BACK. 
I GUESS THE TOTAL AMOUNT THEY 
ARE BRINGING BACK IS 
APPROXIMATELY $230 BILLION AND 
THEY ARE PUTTING UP THE REST 
THE OLD FASHION WAY. 
THEY ARE BRINGING THIS MONEY 
BACK. 
IT WOULD NEVER HAVE COME BACK. 
THEY ARE GOING TO BUILD AN 
INCREDIBLE CAMPUS AND LOTS OF 
OTHER THINGS. 
WE JUST LEFT WISCONSIN AND WHAT 
IS BUILDING UP IN WISCONSIN IS 
LITERALLY AND I SAID IT THE 8 
8th WONDER OF THE WORLD. 
IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING. 
15,000 JOBS GOING TO COST $15 
BILLION. 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO 
INCREDIBLE YOU HAVE TO GO SEE 
IT. 
NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE WHAT IS 
HAPPENING. 
MORE NAN 100 UTILITY COMPANIES 
HAVE LOWERED PRICES AS A DIRECT 
RESULT OF OUR BUSINESS TAX CUTS 
SAVING AMERICANS $3 BILLION ON 
THEIR UTILITY BILLS. 
UTILITY BILLS ARE GOING DOWN. 
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ARE AT A 44 
YEAR LOW. 
THAT'S A GOOD ONE. 
44 YEARS. 
 
SOMETHING I AM SO PROUD OF. 
I LOVE IT. 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE LOWEST 
LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS 
 
I'M LOOKK AT KEVIN. 
THAT WAS A GOOD JOB. 
WE WERE ALL RIGHT. 
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WAS 
RIGHT. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY UNEMPLOYMENT 
FOR HISPANIC AMERICANS LIKEWISE 
IS AT THE LOWEST POINT IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
>> UNEMPLOYMENT FOR WOMEN IF 
YOU LISTENED TO MY SPEECH TWO 
WEEKS AGO THE LOWEST IN 21 
YEARS NOW I'M SAYING THE LOWEST 
IN 65 YEARS AND SOON WILL BE 
THE LOWEST IN HISTORY. 
BIG DIFFERENCE. 
IN A WEEK OR TWO IT WILL BE 
HISTORY CLOSE TO HISTORY. 
65 YEARS IS A LONG TIME. 
I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY 
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR DISABLED 
AMERICANS HAS REACHED RECORD 
LOWS GIVING AMERICANS THE 
CHANCE TO REALIZE THEIR 
UNLIMITED POTENTIAL, AND THAT'S 
WHAT IT IS. 
UNLIMITED POTENTIAL. 
PRAUS APPLAUSE MANY FORMER 
INPLATES ARE ALSO GETTING A 
SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE. 
WE ARE KEEPING OUR PROMISE TO 
BUY AMERICAN AND HIRE AMERICAN 
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS OUR 
ECONOMY IS SO GOOD OUR 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS SO LOW AND OUR 
EMPLOYMENT IS SO HIGH MAYBE 
THAT'S AN EVEN NICER WAY OF 
SAYING IT AND PEOPLE THAT WANT 
TO GET A SECOND CHANCE. 
INMATES PEOPLE COMING OUT OF 
JAIL WHERE THE STIGMA WAS SO 
GREAT PEOPLE WEREN'T HIRING 
BUSINESSES WEREN'T HIRING THEY 
ARE HIRING THEM NOW IN RECORD 
NUMBERS AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THESE BUSINESSES ARE SAYING 
THEY ARE FANTASTIC. 
THEY'RE SET. 
AND AS ONE GENTLEMAN IN 
PARTICULAR HE HIRED TEN INMATES 
NEVER DID IT BEFORE AND HE SAID-
-I WOULDN'T SAY HE SAID ALL OF 
THEM BUT HE SAID SEVEN OF THEM 
ARE SO INCREDIBLE. 
NOT A BAD PERCENTAGE. 
I THINK THAT'S A BETTER 
PERCENTAGE THAN WE HAVE. 
HE SAID SEVEN OF THEM ARE AS 
GOOD AS HE HAS EVER HAD AND 
HE'S GOING TO DO A LOT MORE OF 
IT SO THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A 
GREAT ECONOMY TO SOLVE THAT 
PROBLEM, JARED, RIGHT? 
 
>> AND CHRIS, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH CHRIS. 
BUT THIS IS ALL BECAUSE WE ARE 
ONE COUNTRY AND ONE FAMILY AND 
WE SALUTE ONE GREAT BEAUTIFUL 
AMERICAN FLAG. 
WE LOVE THAT FLAG. 
AND AT LAST, OUR COUNTRY 
FINALLY HAS A TAX SYSTEM THAT 
IS PRO JOBS, PRO WORKER, PRO 
FAMILY AND PRO AMERICAN. 
 
SO ONE INCREDIBLE CITIZEN WHO 
HAS BENEFITED FROM OUR TAX CUTS 
AND NEW JOB ACT IS HILL. 
I LOVE THAT NAME. 
IF I HAVE ANOTHER DAUGHTER I 
THINK I'M GOING TO NAME HER 
LASONIA. 
CAN I COPY? 
I LIKE THAT NAME. 
OF JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA. 
GREAT PLACE. 
I KNOW IT WELL. 
SHE'S THE DIRECTOR AT CUSTOMER 
CARE AT CROWLEY MARINE. 
FOLLOWING THE TACH CUTS AND 
JOBS ACT, CROWLEY WAS ABLE TO 
PAY EMPLOYEES LIKE HER A BIG 
TAX CUT BONUS. 
THEY TOOK A LOT OF MONEY AND 
THEY GAVE IT AROUND TO THE 
EMPLOYEES. 
THAT BONUS WILL HELP SUPPORT 
THE EDUCATION OF CHRISTIAN. 
 
>> PRETTY GOOD RIGHT? 
PRETTY GOOD. 
SO WE ARE SO HAPPY FOR YOUR 
FAMILY. 
AND I KNOW YOUR SONS ARE GOING 
TO MAKE YOU VERY PROUD. 
THEY ARE GREAT YOUNG MEN AND 
LASONIA, PLEASE WOULD YOU SAY A 
FEW WORDS PLEASE? 
 
>> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT FOR 
THE INVITE. 
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. 
AS YOU SAID, CROWLEY MARITIME 
WAS ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE 
TAX REFORM BY PAYING EMPLOYEES 
BONUSES. 
AND IN RETURN MY FAMILY, WE 
WERE ABLE TO INVEST IN OUR 
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. 
>> MY SON CAMERON WILL BE 
ENTERING INTO HIS SENIOR YEAR 
AT MOREHOUSE COLLEGE IN 
ATLANTA, GEORGIA  
AND MY YOUNGEST WILL BE 
ENTERING INTO HIS FRESHMAN YEAR 
AT SAVANNAH STATE BOTH IN THE 
FALL.
SO BECAUSE OF THIS CROWLEY 
MARITIME I'VE BEEN THERE FOR 28 
YEARS AND FOR THE COMPANY TO 
BENEFIT FROM SUCH A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH THEY WERE 
ABLE TO GET BACK TO THEIR 
EMPLOYEES SO I WANT TO THANK 
NOT ONLY MR. PRESIDENT FOR 
ALLOWING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
TELL OUR STORY BUT ALSO CROWLEY 
AS A COMPANY THAT I'VE BEEN 
WITH FOR SO LONG THROUGHOUT MY 
CAREER SO THANK YOU AGAIN. 
>> BY THE WAY, SHE GOT THE 
BIGGEST BY FAR INCLUDING YOU 
IVANKA AND INCLUDING ALL OF MY 
POLITICAL GENIUSES OUT HERE. 
GREAT JOB. 
IT'S LIKE YOU ARE A 
PROFESSIONAL SPEAKER. 
VERY GOOD. 
HAVE YOU DONE THAT BEFORE? 
>> I HAVE NOT. 
>> YOU HAVE NOT? 
THAT'S CALLED POTENTIAL. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. 
ANOTHER AMERICAN WHO HAS USED 
HIS TAX CUT TO GIVEN BACK TO 
OTHERS IS GUY BURKEBILE 
PRESIDENT OF GUY IN SOMERSET, 
PENNSYLVANIA THE GREAT STATE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
INCREDIBLE PLACE. 
GUY INCREASED BONUSES, RAISED 
SALARIES AND PURCHASED NEW 
EQUIPMENT. 
HE ALSO HIRED 30 NEW EMPLOYEES 
TO HELP MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND 
WHICH IS ACTUALLY BOOMING RIGHT 
NOW THE BEST HE'S EVER HAD AND 
HERE WITH GUY ARE TWO OF HIS 
TREMENDOUS EMPLOYEES. 
LEE AND DIEST AND MICHELLE 
TRUAK. 
WE WANT TO ASK GUY TO COME UP 
AND SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE 
TAX CUTS AND HOW IT'S AFFECTED 
YOUR COMPANY AND I ASSUME THE 
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR YOU ARE 
REALLY HAPPY. 
PLEASE. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAVE 
VOTED FOR THIS TAX BILL I CAN'T 
TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO 
MY COMPANY AND MY EMPLOYEES. 
WHEN I FOUNDED MY COMPANY IN 
1995 I MORTGAGED MY HOUSE SEVEN 
TIMES IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE 
GROWTH OF THE COMPANY OVER THE 
NEXT 10, 15 YEARS BEFORE THE 
COMPANY FINALLY GOT LARGE 
ENOUGH THAT IT COULD STAND ON 
ITS OWN. 
THE MONEY THAT WE ARE SAVING 
FROM THE CORPORATE TAX CUTS I 
HAVE REINVESTED WHACK INTO OUR 
BUSINESS AND INTO OUR 
EMPLOYEES. 
WE RECENTLY JUST BUILT AN 
ADDITION ONTO OUR MANUFACTURING 
FACILITY IN SOMERSET, 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
THIS ADDITION INCLUDES NEW 
EQUIPMENT, A NEW COMPOUNDING 
ROOM, AND A NEW LAB FOR 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT 
IS FIVE TIMES LARGER THAN OUR 
OLD LAB. 
 
THIS INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY 
HAS LED TO A 35% INCREASE IN 
SALES OVER THE FIRST QUARTER IN 
ADDITION TO THE 30 NEW JOBS 
THAT WE CREATED THIS YEAR SO 
FAR. 
♪  ♪
SO WITH THE TAX CUT MONEY 
INCREASING SALARIES AND ALSO 
INCREASED BONUSES TO OUR 
EMPLOYEES. 
I HAVE SOME OF MY EMPLOYEES 
THAT HAVE COME DOWN SITTING 
DOWN HERE IN THE FOURTH ROW AND 
I HAVE TWO RIGHT HERE. 
MICHELLE HER SON ALSO WORKS FOR 
US, STEW. 
MICHELLE IS ONE OF OUR LINE 
LEADERS. 
SHE'S USING THE ADDITIONAL 
MONEY FROM HER INCREASED BONUS 
TO FIX HER CAR. 
I TAKE IT SO SHE HAS A RELIABLE 
WAY TO WORK EVERY DAY. 
>> AND YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVER REMARKS 
ON THE SUCCESS OF HIS TAX PLAN 
SIGNED INTO LAW SIX MONTHS AGO. 
MR. TRUMP ALSO ADDRESSED THE 
DEADLY SHOOTING AT ANNAPOLIS 
MARYLAND YESTERDAY. 
HE SAID IT SHOCKED THE 
CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION AND 
FILLED OUR HEARTS WITH GRIEF. 
WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE ON THAT 
RAMPAGE AHEAD INCLUDING NEW 
DETAILS ON THE SUSPECT. 
KEEP IT RIGHT HERE, YOU'RE 
STREAMING CBSN.
