it's July 27th I'm Ezra Levin and you're watching battleground hello rebels it's great to be back you know I loved doing it battleground every single day at 12 min eastern time and we had a real run there for about two months but then I had to travel I went to Israel and I tried to do it from there but the internet connection was so wonky and even the time zones didn't work and then I had to go to London for Tommy Robinson's appeal and obviously during during the time I would do I mean just the times didn't work and it's just I love doing it but it just is tough for me to commit to doing it every single day and it's not great if I'm missing you know 50% or 2/3 of them but it is my goal to have a live chat every Friday and here we go so it's great to be back thank you for joining me and thanks to my friend David Menzies who did a lot of the shows when I was away just a reminder for folks for whom this is new super chat is the fun word invented by YouTube and Google to describe what we're doing it's a live chat I'm coming to you live which is the scheduling challenge we've been talking about as you can see on the side of the screen there there's comments in real time but what the super chat function is it's sort of neat you can make your comments in a bright highlighted color and you can even make it appended affixed to the top of the comment box there for a period of time by chipping in a couple of bucks and what's great for us at the rebel is that we actually get I think 70% of that money which is good in the days of D monetization where YouTube Google Twitter Facebook whatever they censor the Shadowman ad funds conservative sites so we really are advertising it's being cut back by 85 percent by YouTube so believe it or not if you chip in five bucks or five pounds or whatever currency you have that's just it goes goes to us so that's a pleasant change yeah there we have it I see it I the corner of my I got my computer open here and out of the corner of my eye I see Mary and Garcia chipping in a dollar ninety-nine well thank you very much free Tommy well that is one of the things I want to talk about today because I have news from from Tommy Robinson sorry I'm just sending another producer this morning I received a text from Tommy's family and then I spoke by phone with one of Tommy's lawyers and they confirm that the court of appeal that Tommy's lawyers argued in front of I think it was on July 18th of memory serves me correctly they will be returning with a verdict next week what's weird about the news I got both from the family and from the lawyer is that the judges indicate they'll have their verdict on Tuesday or Wednesday will that mean that's like say hey come to my wedding it's on Tuesday or Wednesday all right it's already Friday can you please tell me which of those two days well look I have not buddies with the judges I can't just text them and say which day you're talking about so I I have to I have to book my ticket assuming it'll be the earlier of the days and also permitting that it'll be the later of the two days so I got it if I'm gonna go there I mean I don't want to assume it's on the Wednesday and miss it but if I'm there early I obviously I'm gonna stick around if it is on the Wednesday so there you go so I hopped on Expedia and the cheapest flights that bring me in Monday night so in case it's Tuesday morning the cheapest flight is almost 2000 Canadian even on Expedia sorted by price economy class so that's just what it's like when you fly last-minute to London and the hotel I booked last time said they're happy to have me back at a 15% discount which is nice but it's still expensive to stay near the court and of course that makes sense I don't want to be far away from the court I don't want to miss it so I am going back to London and if you could help chip in to cover my costs please do we've set up the page at Tommy Trial calm Tommy trial calm I've just got to go over there and here's why because the mainstream media lie through their teeth that I saw that when I covered Tommy's appeal I was there in the courtroom and I was typing as fast as I could that I was very glad that the judge permitted us to live tweet from the courtroom and there was a chance he would not I asked the clerk to put the questions I got there really early as you may know and I talked to the clerk and I explained who I was and I was trying to do oh and I see another super chap thank you very much being writing biblical word to him Marianne Garcia thinks I'll get to the comments in a minute I'm just opening up with a little ramble here so I got to the court really early and I talked to the clerk he's very fancy courtroom and there there were desks there for media there's a media section in in the court Jaison Matt chipped in 279 thank you so I knew there were media friendly sort of but I didn't know if I could tweet from the court but the the clerk put it to the judge and it was actually the very first thing the judge said is yes megha ran what bet thank you the judge said yes so I sat there i actually sat next to John Carson I tried not to bug him but I asked him to explain a few things to me and he usually said it's really what he said I'd try not to be a pest but I wanted I'd like they were talking about certain cases that I was unfamiliar with and I'm like American and Canadian courts where all the court filings and briefings are public I start how it works in the UK they're they're privately filed pleadings so that was news to me anyhow so I was asked I was bugging John Carson and he kept on saying shush but I figured it out mostly I think I we did 176 times that day and I'm guessing 150 of them were from the court so I was typing as fast as my little fingers could fly and you know I may have had some typos I may have had some I may have misheard something but I think I generally got it right and my Twitter analytics if you can believe it says that those tweets were viewed 5.7 million times 5.7 million times plus I did about 10 videos now the reason I'm telling you this is because there were at least six or seven other mainstream media outlets there including the BBC I said hello to someone from the BBC including someone from The Independent the falsely named liberal newspaper and the folks who are actually in the court I think did a fair enough job of live tweeting what they saw DJ foster says thanks for all you do to keep us informed well you're welcome but what I found unbelievable is that at least two senior mainstream media journalists were tweeting about the appeal hearing and they were not there in the courtroom they were tweeting authoritative Lee they were opining they were giving their views and they weren't even in the room and they got their facts wrong Jane Reynolds $10.99 great work for Tommy thank you for saying that let me tell you why that's important and I'm game names here The Guardian the political correspondent channel 4 was their video editor who also works on their fact check so they were tweeting falsehoods about Tommy now it would be bad enough if they were in the court tweeting falsehoods but they weren't even in that courtroom in both of these cases these two Liars were were saying that Tommy was not appealing to set this itself that Tommy sorry the conviction itself for contempt of court in fact Tommy was not only appealing the sentence he was appealing his conviction in Leeds County Court and believe it or not he was appealing his conviction a year ago in Canterbury the one that happened when he worked for us and there was a technical reason he did so because and I won't get into it now but it was an interesting appeal by the lawyers I don't know if it'll be successful but I but it certainly showed to me they were leaving no stone unturned and that made me feel good I mean I thought that was a bit of stretch to be candid but the fact that they were going that far made me feel good I thought well geez if they're actually appealing the Canterbury conviction a year ago then I know they're doing everything they ought to be doing cuz they're going further I see some more super Chester let me catch up Kevin Victor 20 rupees I think that that symbol is thank you very much Scot Conklin 10 bucks thanks Colin but you can you can make a comment with your super chat by the way like Colin Buckley chipped in five pounds he says would Tommy's release mark a turning point in our fight for justice yes and I'll tell you why first of all I mean and again I'm not a British solicitor I've been talking to Tommy's lawyers and I've been trying not to bug them like I'm so curious I got so many questions but remember they don't work for me right they work for Tommy I'm we're just crowdfunding them a year ago in Canterbury the lawyers worked for me because Tommy worked for us and and it was a it was a rebel thing we're just doing the crowdfunding so they don't actually work for me of course these lawyers the Tommy's client don't mean they know I'm an ally and everything but they still have to be careful not to disclose things to me because that would violate solicitor client privilege do you understand what I'm saying if I am NOT the client and they tell me something that is secret legally it's not secret anymore right that's what solicitor client privilege is so you know they've been very professional that way and I am may I ask them a hundred questions and they give me some answers but the right thing is for them to give me a few answers if you take my meaning and even to keep from me that they know I want to know because it because their duties to their clients so they're good lawyers but to answer your question specifically Colin you say will this mark let me read your question precisely will this will Tommy's release mark a turning point in our fight for justice and I see like the east wind chipped in 20 bucks by the way you can you can write a comment with your super check yes it would mark a turning point number one my cursory research shows me that no journalist has been sentenced to prison for contempt of court since 1949 is that amazing so it's what's at almost seventy years the UK does not imprison your cripple is it's a free country right well that's something of Vladimir Putin or Iran does or Venezuela or Cuba right the United Kingdom imprisons of journalists can you name me canna maybe I mean I didn't do a very detailed search I got other things I'm doing the time can anyone out there contradict me when I say the last time a journalist was imprisoned was 1949 isn't that doesn't that tell you something's off right there and not just in prison for a week or for 30 days but for 13 months I've told you the case of George Galloway versus Aishah Ali Khan his very pretty former assistant there in some legal fight there were two court orders against her not to tweet about it to not one but two court orders she violated those two court orders more than 20 times and she was sentenced to 12 weeks that's a very high sentence I doubt she served more than 30 days but that's two court orders more than 20 violations Tommy didn't even violate the court order all he did he did not step set foot on court property he did not say that they were guilty they called them accused or alleged rapists the only thing he did not tell about anything going on in trial the only thing he read on TV was something from the state broadcaster the government of the UK they have a state broadcaster called the BBC and Tommy read from their own website the names of the accused how on earth is that contempt of court and if it is condemned to court for Tommy why is it not contempt of court for the beep see and don't tell me because they published those early the website publishes continuously if you publish something before a publication man comes in and then a publication ban comes in and it's on the website that he publishes continuously you are in contempt so do you see what I'm saying Tommy was not actually guilty of contempt in the first place and if he pled guilty it was because he did not have proper or effective counsel he was not given a proper bill of what he did wrong that's that was what was so interesting about the the appeal is we learned about the Criminal Procedure rules that were not followed either in Leeds or Canterbury a year earlier isn't that interesting isn't that interesting so that's what the appeal was about Mikey Mike chipped in 20 bucks my mouse pen to keep us informed cheers I sure will and Jaclyn and free art Tommy well I think the lawyers are going to do that and I think the judges are going to do that I got to tell you again I I was nervous about the judges cuz you know one other word a lot of fun words over the years from Tommy over the year from Tommy and one of them is a stitch-up in Canada we would say if he was framed or it was a setup but in the UK they say stitch up Tommy keeps on saying stitch up this stitch up that inside job and I and I said yeah Tommy yet so well you know what this was a stitch up and I thought well maybe this court of appeal will be a stitch up to I don't think so maybe he's an adept actor but the Lord Chief Justice of the UK who presided seemed fair now what do you know a guy can give a false face for 3-4 hours right but every intervention he made and by intervention I mean when he asked a question or when he weighed in or when he engaged because it's you know what a court of appeals like you had the lawyers doing 95% of the talking but every once in a while lawyer a judge says what about this or what about that or is that true every intervention made by the chief justice redounded to Tommy's credit he either strengthened the point that Tommy made or he challenged a point to the contrary I was very interesting now there are three judges on the panel one of them judge justice mmm Maura McGowan I'm going from memory I didn't say I didn't think she was sympathetic to Tommy but you know you don't have to be sympathetic to Tommy to look at the law and apply it properly and realize that the law was not applied properly to Tommy in Leeds and therefore whether she likes Tommy or not the verdict was improper and should be overturned and I think that's what's gonna happen let me catch up on some of these super chats urethral grundle what a great name hello it's me again every day I rep shoulders people that don't know that you exist please can you communicate with your merchandise manager and get the ball rolling on cheap bumper stickers get the word out you are so right you are so right thank you for the reminder in fact I think with bumper stickers it almost makes sense to give them away for free right it's advertising Thank You Keith McIntosh from Mexico hey Keith nice to hear from you again and I know you've super chatted before from Mexico long time no donate I haven't been able to determine through media the origin of the Toronto terrorist born in Canada or emigrated as a child refugee or a merit system if merit major failure in the process we'll talk about that see as 1216 I promise we'll spend at least half the show today talking with the Toronto terrorist incident and that's the things basic who what where why when journalism has been pushed aside by narrative spin is another truth I'll come back to that keep I promise Keith Grange thank you for all you have done free Tommy well you know what it's it's being interesting because of course when you work when I'm working with Tommy for a year and you know legally you would say employer-employee but anyone who knows Tommy knows that Tommy doesn't have a boss it's it's like I'm not gonna say like herding cats it's like herding lions you know a lion does not get herded unless it wants to so it's been an unusual change in that when Tommy was working with the rebel it was like a handful all the time but here we had one very clear mission crowdfund the legal appeal be simpler right I was not involved with the demos that was Rahim Qasim and others in the UK congratulations to them congratulations to the funders of the demonstrations thank you and to everyone who attended I can't take any credit for that I had no role in that and I do not purport to be a general spokesman for the family but on the one narrow issue of crowdfunding is legal appeal that's whether you've done and you know what credit goes to our rebel viewers hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of rebel viewers all around the world that's what's been interesting to me is to see how widespread Tommy's support is I think that maybe Tommy always sort of knew it or something but I think he will be incredibly encouraged by the width and depth of his support and of course he's been imprisoned and so his access to information is limited I've been sending him some emails I know other people have you can I don't know if it makes us I guess he's still in prison for a few more days we go to email a prisoner calm you can send him an email and I'm you know you can cut and paste a news story and put it right and you can't send I don't know if you can send a link but you can cut text and paste it so I think he's been given a lot of info in prison because it'll go crazy guys in jail cell by himself he has to read say so I think he gets a sense of how much support there's been out there but I think only when he comes out will he get the true depth of it Kris Simpson really enjoyed your James Dowling pol Breitbart podcast released today on iTunes well done on your accurate dran Danforth reporting hey thanks very much yeah you know I didn't mention that when I was in London I sat down with James telling Poole was a really good guy very you know he's your iconic slightly eccentric totally loveable Brit you know he's great guy lives in the country he made the three-hour journey into the city to meet me and we chatted for an hour and I just rambled so that podcast is up on Breitbart and so thank you for listening to it let's see what we got mics wait thanks for your support appreciate it Keith McIntosh your courtship of Spencer Fernando is becoming insufferable when are you going to put a ring on it and the rebels well you know what I like expensive rent I've never met him by the way the thing is based in Winnipeg and I just see his videos and I see his tweets and I get his emails I signed up for his email and I think he's great now I I did ask him to work for the rebel and he said no I'm too busy doing my Winnipeg stuff on yada yada it's probably true he's a busy guy he's like I think he's a one-man shop but that doesn't stop us from retweeting his stuff which I do and we I think we embed his YouTube videos on our site so he gets the clicks but we bring it to the attention of reviews so I I mean it's it's still pretty good like we get access to all this stuff he's just not a rebel branded talent so I guess the plus side first is we don't have to pay him the downside is we can't lay claim to him but I'm a fan of his I've never talked him on the phone actually I just just communicate with him via a computer but he seems like a good guy doesn't he he's really really good hmm I can't I can't quite I don't know that looks like Greek to me so it just says people if you want to have a chance to not have your guns confiscated it's time to join the CCF Ark a naming coalition for firearm rights and that looks like a Greek name at the top there and I had I can't read Greek but thank you very much for that comment I just want to make sure I haven't missed any super chance guys if I missed any super Jets combined Oh looks like I'm up to speed there okay it's 1221 time is flying we're talking about Tommy I'm going back there you know I don't mind the flight I mean it says seven-hour flight from Toronto I mean it's not the end of the world I fly to that BC it's five hours you know you fly to LA it's five hours I'm not complaining it's just it's frustrating to me that I don't know what the appeal will be issued is that Tuesday or Wednesday how can the judges not know but both the family and the lawyer and I guess that's in folks coming from the same place say Tuesday or Wednesday all right great so now I got a got to go on Monday obviously in case the the lawyers keep me away I mean kiss the Border Patrol keeps me away gotta go early got to be there in case it's on Tuesday if it's not on Tuesday got to be there on Wednesday and I got a book for Wednesday but if it's on Tuesday because I don't know so going to cover a one-hour appeal verdict uh it's four days it's four days whatever I mean what am I gonna do because I got to go in a day early because of the flights I don't want to land at like 8:30 in the morning because in case the flights late and the Heathrow is slow and if I'm detained I'm gonna miss the court so I got to go in on Sunday night land Monday I got to be there in case the verdicts on Tuesday if it's not on Tuesday I got it cool my Jets till Wednesday and if it's on Wednesday Tommy's coming back Wednesday afternoon right so I want to be there so I'm acting cute actually you know returning Thursday so we're talking Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday bits go five days four and a half days including 14 hours in the air just for four what's probably gonna be like a 90 minute court presentation but what are you gonna do that's the law the law is not a speedy thing it grinds slowly but in this case I think it's gonna I think it's gonna have a good result I think Tommy's gonna be freed you see if I missed any super chance oh yeah here we go done no nothing you know Marcin and Harding worked at the same office oh you're certain that's our friend no I think I recognize those names you're talking about the judge in Leeds and the public defender lawyer I think you are that's interesting to me do you have any background on that I'm not disputing it I would just like to corroborate it because that's an interesting thing to say all right so I'm going I'm going back over there I got to pack my bags and it's Friday so I'll get on the plane in two days I'll land in three days the vertical hopefully be on the fourth day if Donnelly's will be on the fifth day and I'll come home on the sixth day but you know why it's important I mean first of all I want to settle the accounts with all the lawyers because there's been a lot of lawyers working hard on this and and of course that's what the crowd funding is for hmm of course one hundred percent of the surplus goes to the family so we want to just tidy that all up but mainly besides you know tidying it up with lawyers and the family I know they're gonna lie about Tommy I just know it hey Alex can you get two clips from Hanna we the clips from the BBC who are the Tommy supporters I use them in a monologue the other day one is a clip of the police horses charging the peppa pig puppet balloon and the other is the BBC reporter lecturing a lady about muslim rape gangs hannah should have those clips I want to play those clips my friend alex is going to get some clips for you Calvin aren't chips in five bucks thanks very much okay while I'm waiting for those clips I'm just gonna read some non super chat comments so here's what we're gonna do it's 1225 we're almost halfway done the show we're getting two clips cuz I've told you about the lies from The Guardian and Channel four right and they're gonna lie again they hate Tommy you know you can hate someone and still report fairly you know what I mean you can be biased but still give a fair and accurate report the UK is they hate Tommy the bias against Tommy but even their facts are false do you understand what I'm saying that's different than just having a strong opinion you can say Tommy Robinson the odious bad guy blah blah blah and then what you say is true like you just gave you your vicious opinion about the guy but then you give your true facts do you understand the difference you could have a very harsh opinion but we all have the same fact son you can have your own opinions but you can't have your own facts and the Guardian and Channel four lied about the underlying facts to support their foul opinions you're never going to change the Guardian or the BBC or Channel four or sky or the Daily Mail or the time for the tiller you bimbeau Tommy it's unfair but life's unfair but why are they lying that's different do you understand what I'm saying it's different to have false facts than to have a strong opinion that's what bugs me that's why I'm going back because they're gonna lie venez case is the BBC and the Guardian the links of people who work for both is quite telling oh yeah you know in Canada here I used the phrase the media party it's like a political party mmm it's cohesive it's ideologically aligned they discipline each other like a party does if they get out of line the campaign there they're really embedded partisans who know that you can be very effective in the media you especially if you work for the state broadcaster I'm like a politician you don't have to raise money I'm like a politician you're not voted out it's a permanent political party you Kip up and down Tories labour in and out but the media party is an eternal party a perpetual party that you can never vote out and the worst thing about the state broadcasts are the BBC in the United Kingdom the CBC here the Australian Broadcasting over the worst thing about the state broadcasters is they are completely immune from public pressure I mean a private broadcaster goes absolutely nuts people can just walk away and we see that in the media so many people just aren't buying crappy left-wing papers newspapers going out of business like crazy the BBC will never go out of business because they extract they extort the money through the force of a gun that licence that is the law in the UK in Canada you don't even have licenses write off your taxes Rama radevich 20 bucks thank you very much for your support appreciate that how are we doing with that vids guys I'm ok I want to start it so thanks Alex and thanks Justin forgetting those videos when I was in London I wasn't the only one who is paying attention to Tony the United Kingdom that's right the British Broadcasting Corporation of the United Kingdom cents one of their investigative reporters on a mission to do a story who are these Tommy Robinson supporters who are they ali patel 40 rupees Thank You Ali and it was like watching a National Geographic special I'm a BBC reporter on going into the deepest darkest jungle of the Amazon to see a tribe that you've never seen before these people called Tommy Robinson supporters now we've got to be careful I've taken all my shots some of them are known to bite let's go now Shh there's the Tommy Robinson supporters in their natural habitat it was like that it was like they were going into an alien world it was like they almost were the bubble suits Oh what if they breathed on me I'll get Tommy cooties I hope I don't get infected with Tommy Robinson itis or something it really was like this the BBC so out of touch with an enormous swath of UK population who are these people so so they sent this guy and of course it being a modern modern narcissist lefty he was mainly about him him him him him him and I did this and I said this and they said this it was it was ridiculous but there's two moments from that BBC mini doc it was like a 13 minute thing two minutes that I found so telling and the first is they went to a tommy demo that's what they call rallies in the UK that calm demos William hen would for Tommy kam radevich 20 bucks thank you so they go to Trafalgar Square which is a beautiful place very important historically and remember this is at the same time that Donald Trump's in the UK I don't know if you remember there was just Trump blimp they called it a blimp it's like a it was pretty it was like a bouncy castle it was like pretty small it's like maybe 20 feet high it was a little balloon that looked like Trump is a baby and they got an enormous media coverage so I want to show you it's a bit of a two-minute clip I think maybe less from the pro Tommy demo so this is from the BBC National Geographic special about who Tommy supporters are I'm just sending this clip up and we'll play the clip in a second so this is a tommy demo and you'll see there's senior citizens kids mums dads a wide variety of people they have signs no racism no vulgarity they have a Peppa Pig balloon can you just google Peppa Pig and show me in it show everybody the image Peppa Pig is a kids show it's British it's about this pig called Peppa and I think my kids used to watch it I think if I recalled she's into ballet or something just throw it up on the screen so there you go Peppa Pig I said it's like Porky Pig in North America right Thanks so someone had a Peppa Pig kids balloon and they just taped a picture of Sadek can the anti-trump auntie Tommy Islamist Muslim Mayor of London they taped a little picture of saticon on the Peppa Pig balloon that's it she got this huge Trump balloon authorized by the mayor and the little way of fighting back is some one of the truck Tommy protests had to pet the big balloon with set economy that's it I have just told you the whole story but police decided that peppa pig balloon was illegal illegal is is this is this the United Kingdom home of John Milton and free speech in Areopagitica and the Magna Carta and it's a it's it's it's illegal now is it yeah not just was this balloon illegal but Mounted Police charged the group of people including families because they had this balloon I swear to god I'm about to show you the clip this is an outrageous clip to begin with but what is the icing on the cake is that this BBC reporter found that unremarkable sort of obvious I think he supported it you just had a family charged by Mounted Police for the Sharia crime of associating a Muslim with a pig zooom that's why it was offensive and the BBC think so yeah there's no problem yeah charge yeah here take a look a balloon catches the eye of the police it's clearly a response to the baby blimp flown by the anti-trump protesters the previous day but the police decide that Peppa Pig crosses a line as officers try to remove the offending balloon bottles of thrown is is that something to report on just in passing the police think it goes too far and they move in and maybe a bottle was thrown and that's not good you don't throw a bottle of police but that might be someone angry that might be an agent provocateur there might be someone legit but you've got nothing else to say about in a modern liberal democracy the cradle of the mother of all Parliament's the mother of freedoms and our rule of law you got your the BBC got nothing to say about police declaring a kid's balloon illegal and moving into to seize it you got bets that's not that's not remarkable - you know because you support that because you're with the BBC with the state broadcaster I see super chat that I missed Theresa Swann shipped in a pound 99 Thank You moon man 2 bucks the fake news media will soon rot in hell Deus vult Jonathan Butler 5 pounds please tell my mother Roz to stay strong for Tommy Roz stay strong for Tommy I truly believe he will be let out of prison on Tuesday or Wednesday ok so I've shown you the first clip I want to show you the second one so at the same Tommy demo at Trafalgar Square there's a lovely woman who's there mining on business and the and the BBC says let's go after and again I told you that this really was a vanity production by the BBC it was it was about a narcissistic lovey the broadcaster's showing how smart he was so so watch this clip I won't i won't set it up anymore other than to say here's a woman worried about muslim rape gangs raping indigenous white British girls that's that's what it is it's Pakistani Muslim men raping indigenous white British girls and the occasional Sikh girl they rape bolts and this is happening on an industrial scale this is what Tommy was reporting on in Leeds when he was arrested this is what Tommy was reporting on in Canterbury when he was arrested this is what happened in rather amore 1,400 girls were raped in the city of just 250,000 so it's not a matter of opinion that this is happening again opinion is I like it I don't like it it's important it's not important those are all opinions but the fact is it's happening there have been convictions and in rather amid the polluted an official report has come out and inquiry at least 1,400 girls raped so it's not a matter of opinion but watch this BBC reporter tried to Gaslight do you know I mean by Gaslight no it's not true no you don't know what you know no no no you're wrong I'm with the BBC I'm telling you wrong you didn't see what you just saw you don't know what you just don't take a look believed that they had sex with children and do you believe I do believe I believe in their country allowed to have sex with you what if I told you that wasn't true because it isn't true I mean I've been to many Muslim countries in the Middle East North Africa it's definitely not true why why we being shown in this country that it is true then why we being held and shown I don't know I believe what I read unless it's proven to be not true and I'm just wondering where you get this idea from what people for instance this rally last month we were told what Sharia law is I'm with the BBC and I'm telling you it's not true I've been to Muslim countries I haven't seen any kids being raped it's not true what you know is not true I'm with the government and I'm here to tell you you've had too much to think we know it's true I just told you how it's true all over the UK and we know it's true another lens we know that child rape is common we know in Afghanistan our Canadian troops American troops British troops discovered what is it called bacha bazi boys basically young boys that are held as male rape slaves for Muslim fighters both the terrorists and the good guys some of the post-traumatic stress from our Canadian Forces was hearing the screams of these boys being raped by their Afghan allies and I'm not even getting into historical Quranic stories like the fact that Mohammed married I sure when she was six and consummated the marriage when she was nine I'm not even talking about that we all know that child marriage is a fact child marriage is a very nice way of saying rape you can't marry someone who's nine you can't marry a nine year old that is not a marriage just on a consensual marriage that is rape that's rape that BBC reporter is a goddamn liar not only is child rape commonplace in the Muslim world even if it's technically illegal it's commonplace but it's happening throughout the United Kingdom that's what Tommy's entire motivation is exposed if there were no child rape gangs in the UK I don't even know what Tommy would do for a living because that is the number one issue that motivates him and has for years and this BBC like if that was not a problem Tommy would I didn't even know if Tommy would be in politics that's his number one issue it's like 95 percent of what he does is fight back on that and this BBC expert I'm going to meet this obscure tribe called Tommy Robinson supporters in their natural habitat and I'll try to teach these chaps a finger to these low-class nothings I'll try and educate them because I'm with the BBC and we have to give these people fire and the wheel because they're very primitive let's go to the Amazon forest now that's the BBC that was not a BBC documentary about Tommy was it that was a BBC documentary about the BBC and they're despised and their disgust for Tommy and their support for police horses charging people who have a Peppa Pig balloon for God's sakes and there's a mum or a grandmom who's worried about women girls being raped and she was just told by the government project when you work for the BBC you are a government journalist for the state broadcaster and we were just told oh and he played that because he was so proud because the documentary is really about him isn't it and how morally superior he is he's virtually signalling to his own bosses at the BBC I got this guy's I'll do I'll do a number on Tommy you see why I'm going back to London for five bloody days you see why I'm going back because do you think that gaslighting lying propagandist for the state do you think he's gonna cover Tommy's trial and verdict accurately level I'm not even talking about fair do you see the factual lie he told that woman the fact that he approved of police mounted police charging someone with a Peppa Pig balloon shows his opinions they're odious they're unreasonable they're disgraceful they're unwritten but their opinions but then he stopped about opinions and he talked about facts and he said to that woman you are wrong there is no child rape in Islam I am telling you because I know and now listen to me you stupid woman listen to me do you see the difference between an odious opinion and a damnable lie do you see the difference that's what I'm going back to London all right I miss some super chance I'm sure of it let's see Mike Disney Ezra I can help next week with a nice room near st. Albans and lifts for you free of charge thanks for all your Tama fication thanks Mike I've already made an arrangement but I but I appreciate that I I don't know my way around the city that well I'm

think he could be out as soon as Tuesday now again I don't know if it's Tuesday or Wednesday but I talked to the lawyer and the prison only prison is an hour away from Tommy's home theoretically he could be home an hour after that someone with a Greek name just read the Trudeau will ban handguns in Canada yeah let's talk about the Toronto terrorism in our remaining moments Donna nuffin says Park Square barristers Co UK about marcin talent harding linkedin park square barristers I've seen screenshots things have changed recently oh you're talking again about any connection between the judge and lore'l look at that same thing one says she had he's welcome but kill the balloon yeah yeah that isn't that the true thing and police will charge our balloon oh my god there's a pepper paint balloon oh my god there's a Peppa Pig balloon rape gangs oh don't say any finger well three in Thailand prison Tommy 23000 jihad he's giving me can you grab a headline of 23000 jihad he's just put that up on the screen people are saying oh you're making up that number I ain't making up the number what's that mi5 or mi6 throw that up on the screen 23,000 G at ease known G Hattie's you can't track 23 yeah huge scale of terror threat revealed UK home to 23,000 jihadis I think this is from the Times of London the most prestigious paper in the UK that's not even a tabloid all right I want to shift gears now mmm because it's 12:45 we talked about Tommy and I'm going back to London getting on a plane no problem if you want to help chip if you can help me with my airfare I'd be grateful I went online to Expedia and the cheapest flight was just under two thousand bucks what can I do it's less been a flight there's gonna help I'm grateful you can do that at Tommy Trial calm I wanna I want to talk about terrorism in Canada because as I've said many times what happens in the UK today it's happening in Canada few years from now so what they went through five years ago was happening here so yeah we had a terrorist attack in Canada and his name is Faisal has sane he's 29 police say he visited Pakistan and Afghanistan police say he visited Isis websites his brother is a drug dealer who right now is in a coma from a drug overdose his brother's surety in court was provided by another man who has over 300 firearms offenses so yeah we're talking about family of the year here but that's life under Justin Trudeau's Canada who knows he might have come in under Stephen Harper wouldn't surprise me Harper that in half a million Muslim migrants in his term we should not put this on the Liberals a lot of things going on here of course oh it's just mental illness nothing to do with Islam nothing to see here people don't buy that because people saw in the video footage that he was not wild he was not mad this terrorists was calm cool collected and handled firearms like an expert the way he shot the way he held the gun the way he calmly reloaded 40 bullets shot he walked by a man named jazz pulsing as the name suggests a Sikh man the picture I saw Jess was saying he just don't wear a turban so Jaspal Singh has brown skin and he could have been mistaken for a Muslim man and I say that because Jaspal Singh says the murderer walked by him and said don't worry man I'm not going to kill you Jaspal Singh said banks I they walked right by each other and Jaspal Singh went on through his life and what he's told book The Globe and Mail in the Toronto Sun Minister yeah look at this he was following me when we got to the end of the Alawis he said don't worry I am NOT going to shoot you Singh recalled seeing said he responded with a thanks and then the two men got closer together we look at each other he said to stay out of his way not as a threat but as a warning can you get the same photo can you from that same story can you get the photo of saying I want to show what he looks like because I think it's relevant because here you've got a terrorist who murdered two women right he murdered a ten year old girl and an eighteen year old young woman so when he said to Jaspal saying don't worry I'm not going to murder you is it because Jaspal Singh is a man and he was only murdering women is it because jazz was singing is brown that's jazz people saying you see what I mean he doesn't true look traditionally Sikh because he doesn't he's got the Sikh bracelet on his right arm as you can see but that's pretty low-key he's not wearing your big turban wearing a hat so that could be a Muslim fella right so did the terrorist spare Jaspal Singh's life because he's a man because he's brown skinned because the terrorist thought he was Muslim why he was an indiscriminate shooter it seems 40 shots more than a dozen wounded to murder but not Jaspal Singh why did he not shoot this man and in fact why did he positively say just be careful man I'm gonna start shooting don't go get in the way you'll you're fine I guess what I'm saying is it's a terrorist attack obviously and the calm manner in which the terrorists did it puts a lie to the official narrative it was just mental illness now our friends David Menzies went down to the Danforth neighborhood and I want to play his latest video where he does the Streeters and it's 1249 so we've got some time I'd like to play as much of his new Streeters video as possible you guys so not just 60 seconds uh how long is it his is one from yesterday it's about what it's about six minutes let's play the whole thing folks I want you to see I want you to see six minutes of David Menzies down at the Danforth David's very gentle very gentle non-inflammatory talking is fairly normal people and I want you to see what people not in the media party have to say people in the neighborhood I want you to see what they have to say about the terrorist attack do they believe the official narrative that this was just mental illness it's nothing to do with Islam Justin Trudeau is being on holiday all week it's gotta be nothing the Prime Minister surely would care was something serious here take a look at six minutes of David Menzies on Danforth day after of law enforcement finally made the name of the mass shooter Faisal Husseini public as you can see folks I'm in front of a makeshift memorial people are coming by here all day long writing words of encouragement and support but the question arises do people here on the Danforth by the official explanation that mr. Hussein was acting as a mentally ill individual or was there perhaps something more to his act of carnage are you buying the the narrative by the media and the authorities that this was merely an act of mental illness or was there perhaps something more oh absolutely not this was not active this is an act of terrorism absolutely and my personal point of view it was projected towards women maybe I'm not sure what his objective was what his motive was but I do feel he was aiming at women certainly the unfortunately the the two victims he murdered were woman sir if it was terrorism why is a reluctance on the behalf of the authorities in the immediate a called terrorism because the political agenda come out and tell the truth and the media now has been hiding a lot of this information and I think the people are just getting fed up with it so ma'am you're saying that your daughter's friends were in the second cup and they made it out in time to 17 and two close friends of my daughter and they were just out getting a cold drink at the second cup and they got two legs I needed to drink remade thank goodness or they probably would have walked out the front door just as the shooter arrived so the gunman reloaded and started shooting again through the front window and they were able to get out through the back with all of the people there just stampeding to get out got it through the back alley and then to a stranger's house and the lady took care of them and drove them home thank goodness he lives in a heavily populated Afghani Pakistani neighborhood I used to live there unfortunately had to live in the same building once before many years ago over 25 years ago it was a very nice prestigious area and and then if you actually lived at 43 torn cliff yes yes over 26 years ago what made you leave man the area start changing on the east side of that area 75 Drive if he was mentally ill how did he obtain a handgun go to the trouble of that how did he get some military training according to a police officer the way he was shooting was he absolutely had some military training or at least some training and shooting a gun and if so if he's mentally unstable how did he manage to get a gun and do this we are as fast as we're we endeavor to be caregivers and I have seen and I think perhaps if you live in this city you'd have seen the upsurge in mental challenges in in the city but in terms of Isis we have no comment on that it's been a bad year though hasn't it I mean you know in terms of how many people are being killed in this city do you guys personally feel safe in the city right now I feel safe I love to run I love to honor I feel I feel safe absolutely not absolutely not it's a cover-up well you know that did the news always like according to Trump fake news biased news that wants to hide anything like this from the people so that they don't inflame passions they don't get people upset you know the media is left-wing bias everybody knows it and people are starting to find out about it and they're starting to get pissed off in Canada were such a wonderful supportive country of many cultures why why take out that kind of anger on all of us who were supportive of different religions and cultures that would be a shame if you see the videos this guy was trained he was walking and shooting I can do that you cannot do that only a trained person can do that and he seemed to be very selective with his targets I mean he wasn't shooting at everybody was going to mean specific people I'm not sure if he was selecting but obviously he knew what he was doing definitely because if you look at the videos again you will see him the way he shoots and the way he holds the gun he had some kind of a training not not a small training he had big training if I take a gun if you take a gun and you go around I don't think you can find the target and he knew how to get the target he seemed that way on the video for sure at the end of the day was this indeed an act of terrorism Who am I to say but I believe there's some kind of a link yes he had some kind of you know I don't want to scare people but maybe he did because people are telling me that when he was walking on the street he was talking in another language and he was making sounds I don't know what kind of sounds were you saying and for all the politician is you're not doing enough for this tour-guide well you guys are not doing enough what would you like to see them do sir I don't know if they'd get rid of the gun a gun because look we're gonna get rid of the guns then what's gonna come out the knives and that we're going to get rid of the vans okay we gotta go on with our lives you can't live in fear we can't let fear anymore this is so terrible it's killing me like that's really it's just put a little girl in the eighty year old it's just every hit ripped my heart apart like when I don't wanna heard this I just could not stop crying my mom just left for Greece and then what you called me she told me I'm doing sure about this she was just a girl like I would never believe this would happen here on the dam for never never believe that to the politician is please I'm begging you I'm begging you please for the bomb of I'm Canada Toronto please do something anything open programs or young children anything I'm just so heartbroken that I I guess I I feel for everybody else the people in restaurants and very emotional ending there but what do you make of the earlier comments even that man's comments at the end you know if you take the guns they're gonna come with knives it's not a the problem with terrorism it's not the particular tool they use I was in the UK and I retrace the steps of the Westminster terrorists attacker who used a van actually a 4x4 in less than 90 seconds he sped across a bridge hopped out with a gun in the knife or sorry just just a knife he killed someone on the bridge he killed the first cop he met so he used a vehicle and a knife I also went to where Lee Rigby was murdered he was murdered by butcher knives big machetes so it's not the tool it's not the gun it's not the not the 4x4 it's the terrorist and if you you know terrorists will use anything bill the RAM airplanes into buildings it's not the tool that's terrifying it's the person and the ideology behind it there's a few super chats I missed the person with the Greek name I can't read says Trudeau talking about sending the police door-to-door to confiscate legal handguns ironically at police gunpoint I haven't heard that that I'm skeptical about that I'm sure they will ban things and when that doesn't work they'll double ban them and when that doesn't work they'll triple ban them SuperDuper ban them that's the point about gun bans is if you're gonna commit murder you're probably not going to obey a paperwork offence and not have a gun our one P buck chips in ten bucks thank you it says thanks for your honesty Ezra Harper isn't quite the conservative hero some people think he is not oh you're talking about Stephen Harper letting in half a million Muslim microts I think you're right that's not Jason Kenney to by the way you see migration Minister warrior Linda Clark says Oh believers I fight those who do not believe yeah I mean if you read the Koran it's a difficult read it's not written in the style of the Western mind it's a terrifying document is a document of war it's 1258 let me just check with my team have a missed any super chat so you guys know about no I think we're good all right well listen it's been a pleasure being back it looks like we have about a thousand people watching live that's that's nice to have you back it's great to be back believe me I really enjoyed doing these daily but and next week I'm gonna be in the UK and who knows what my schedules going to be like and who knows what the hotel Wi-Fi is going to be like I tried doing it when I was traveling a few weeks ago and it just fell apart so I don't want to make that commitment and fail to live up to it so my goal is every Friday to have a super chat I thought today was good we had a few vids we shared a few vids but we we went through a lot of comments there's a ton of comments Kalvin aren't are you saying I missed one of your your super chats if so I'm sorry I just so many things going behind there looking the camera I see its 1259 so let me say this I'll have my Regular Show tonight I'll be talking about the amazing GDP numbers in the United States over 4% growth that economy is just roaring I will fly I will not be here on Monday I will be flying to the UK because I want to land a night early again if I have any problems at Heathrow or whatever I don't think I will but and I don't want to my plane to be late I don't want to miss it so I got to be there for Tuesday morning maybe Wednesday and if Thomas let out Wednesday afternoon or something so I'm not actually going to come home so I don't have my I just don't have my tickets in front of me but it's it's it's gonna be I think I'm away for like five days but I will do as many videos as I can from the UK when I was there two weeks ago I think I did ten or something and I did over a hundred tweets so I promise I will keep you posted on the Tomi news as best I can I'm not saying I'm going to be a hundred percent perfect when you're live tweeting Full Tilt in court sometimes you get something wrong but but I think my hair is a trivial compared to the amount of information we were able to get out I believe my main mission in going to London besides taking care of the legal bills to finishing that off is through about the lies would you agree with me especially based I want to show you today from the BBC would you agree with me that they intend to lie about Tommy and they always will all right that's it for today's battleground I'll see some of you tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern for my regular show until next time on behalf of all of us here at rebel world headquarters keep fighting for freedom you
