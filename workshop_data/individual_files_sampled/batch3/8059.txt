Neil: ALWAYS GOOD CATCHING UP WITH YOU A.B. THANKS SO MUCH, NEIL. Neil: LET'S GET A READ ON ALL OF THIS. YOU MAY NOT THINK THE HOUSE HAS ANY SAY BUT INFLUENCE AND SENTIMENT AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL HOW THIS IS ALL GOING DOWN. DAN KILDEE JOINS US NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Neil: GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE WHERE MICHIGAN MIC MITCIGAN MIC THIS WAS GOING. MITCHGAN MIC MCCONNELL WAS SAYING GET THE INVESTIGATION GOING AND FBI ON IT. THEY WILL MOVE THE GOAL POST AND DEADLINE AND START COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING. YOU SNANCHTS I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF SENATORS WHO HAVE MADE THEIR MINDS UP AND OUGHT NOT FOCUS ON THEM. HANDFUL OF SENATORS WHO ACTUALLY COULD BENEFIT FROM THE INFORMATION THAT THIS INVESTIGATION MIGHT REVEAL. SO, RATHER THAN FOCUSING ONLY ON HOW QUICKLY THE PROCESS MOVES, OR WHETHER THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS CAN EITHER CRITICIZE THE PROCESS OR CONFIRM IT. LEAVE UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT INFORMATION WILL BE REVEALED THAT WILL EITHER CONFIRM OR SOMEHOW NEGATE THE CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. THERE ARE HANDFUL OF SENATORS OHIO THINK ACTUALLY WANT THAT INFORMATION. THAT MAY SEEM A LITTLE POLYANNA. WHEN YOU TOOK JEFF FLAKE'S COMMENTS AT FACE VALUE. THAT HE WANTED TO KNOW MORE AND HE FELT LIKE HE NEEDED TO KNOW MORE. LET'S LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FBI, WHICH CLEARLY CAN GET AN EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION DONE IN THE 7-DAY TIME PERIOD. Neil: YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE CONCERNED IF IT RAPID UP TOMORROW? IF THEY INTERVIEWED 24 PEOPLE AND ABLE TO SYNTHESIZE THAT INFORMATION, THE DATE ISN'T SO IMPORTANT. THIS IS A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. WE OUGHT TO GET IT RIGHT. Neil: FRIDAY DATE TO GET IT DONE. WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL WAS SAYING MOOD OF THE HOUSE AND THE MOOD IN THE SENATE. GOING TO BE A BIG ELECTION YEAR ISSUE. GOING TO BE A BIG ISSUE IN FIVE WEEKS. DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE? WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS, DO THEY SAY THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO ME HOW THIS THING GOES? I THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT FEEL THAT IF THIS CONFIRMATION WERE RAMMED THROUGH AND THERE WERE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, THEY MIGHT HOLD SOME SENATORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. BUT I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING, IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS. A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AS HARD AS IT MIGHT SEEM IT IS TO DO THIS, WE JUST NEED TO SET ASIDE THE ELECTORAL IMPACT AND JUST GET IT DONE. Neil: IT'S INTERESTING TWO DIFFERENT POLLS OUT. REPUBLICANS BY AND LARGE THINK REPUBLICANS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB WITH IT DEMOCRATS BY AND LARGE THINK DEMOCRATS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB TRYING TO FIGHT THIS. IS IT GOVERNMENT THE WAY YOU LIKE TO SEE IT FUNCTION? NO, NO. I'M REALLY TIRED OF THIS. YOU KNOW. Neil: SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES, YOU KNOW, TALKED ABOUT WE ARE NOT EVEN DONE WITH THIS EVEN IF HE MAKES IT TO THE COURT. LOOK FOR WAYS TO GETTING HIM OFF THE COURT IS THAT PRODUCTIVE. DEPENDS ON WHAT THE INFORMATION REVEALS. I'M NOT SURE HOW PRODUCTIVE IT IS. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FAULT FACTS AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO IT. THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ON EVERY QUESTION THE PARTIES RETREAT TO THEIR POLLS, AND HOLD ON TO THOSE POSITIONS RATHER THAN JUST ALLOW THE PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD, TAKE THE INFORMATION, MAKE A JUDGMENT, THIS IS A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT, WE OUGHT TO DO IT RIGHT. WE OUGHT TO GET IT DONE. Neil: SIR, WHILE I HAVE GOT YOU HERE. BIG INDUSTRIAL STATE. IMPORTANT STATE, MICHIGAN. THE PRESIDENT GETTING THE CANADIANS ON THIS COURT. AT JUST THE 11TH HOUR. AND I'M WONDERING, HE HAS TO GET CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THIS WHICH PRESUMABLY WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THE MID TERMS SO WE COULD HAVE A DIFFERENT MAKEUP IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE A DIFFERENT MAKEUP IN THE SENATE. AND I'M TOLD THAT THIS IS VERY WORKER FRIENDLY, ACTUALLY UNION FRIENDLY SO THE PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE AN EASIER TIME WITH YOU GUYS, DEMOCRATS, THAN HE WOULD REPUBLICANS IS, THAT TRUE? IT'S POSSIBLE. I MEAN, THE CHANGE WITH THE SO-CALLED RULES OF ORIGIN COULD ACTUALLY BE HELPFUL. Neil: IN OTHER WORDS, HOW MUCH IS NORTH AMERICAN. RIGHT, GOES TO 75% WHICH COULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. FOR ME THE DAIRY PROVISIONS SUPPORTING SOME OF OUR PRODUCER, MILK PRODUCERS ESPECIALLY COULD BE IMPORTANT. THE PIECE WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IS WHAT THOSE LABOR PROVISIONS LOOK LIKE AND LABOR MECHANISM IS ONE PIECE AND SECONDLY OUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS NEW AGREEMENT, WHICH I CAN'T COME UP WITH THE NAME OF IT YET IT'S NOT GOING TO BE NAFTA. Neil: THE US MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT. OUR CONSIDERATION WILL BE IN PART TRIGGERED BY MEXICAN GOVERNMENT ACTION AND I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE. MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE IN ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS WHAT THE WORKER PROTECTIONS AND WORKER WRITES AND WAGES ARE SO THAT OUR WORKERS DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST PEOPLE MAKING A DOLLAR AN HOUR. IF THAT COMES TOGETHER THE WAY IT POSSIBLY, COULD I I HAVEN'T MADE MY JUDGMENT YET, THEN I THINK WE COULD SEE THIS THING MOVE FORWARD,
