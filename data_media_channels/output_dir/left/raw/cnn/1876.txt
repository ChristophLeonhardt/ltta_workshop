1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
mr. president thank you so much a
president need to stop have a question

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,779
for you as well but if I could start
with President Trump in the middle of

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,309
hurricane Harvey hitting on Friday night
you chose to pardon former sheriff joe

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,480
arpaio I wonder if you could tell us
what was behind your thinking for

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,010
issuing a pardon for the sheriff and as
well what do you say to your critics

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,710
even some in your own party who say it
was the wrong thing to do well a lot of

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,220
people think it was the right thing to
do Jenna and actually in the middle of a

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,098
hurricane even though it was a Friday
evening I assume the ratings would be

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,219
far higher than they would be normally
you know the hurricane was just starting

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:42,149
and I put it out that I had pardoned as
we call as we say Sheriff Joe he's done

11
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,100
a great job for the people of Arizona
he's very strong on borders very strong

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,190
on illegal immigration he is loved in
Arizona I thought he was treated

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,910
unbelievably unfairly when they came
down with their big decision to go get

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,930
him right before the election voting
started as you know and he lost in a

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,040
fairly close election he would have won
the election but they just hammered him

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,619
just before the election I thought that
was a very very unfair thing to do when

17
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,159
I mentioned him the other night you saw
the massive crowd we had the people went

18
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,840
crazy when I said what do you think of
Sheriff Joe or something to that effect

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,220
the place went absolutely crazy when I
was in Arizona last week and as far as

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,520
pardons are concerned I actually did
this just before the mini because I

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,790
assumed that somebody would ask me the
question I didn't know it would be you

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,180
as you can attest you didn't even know
you're going to be called but I thought

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,850
I would and you know Sheriff Joe is a
great veteran of the military great law

24
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,340
enforcement person somebody that's won
many many elections in the state of

25
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,930
Arizona but I wanted to look at some of
the other people that were pardoned over

26
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,460
the years and if you look at as an
example President Clinton pardoned Marc

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,729
Rich who was charged with crimes going
back decades including illegally buying

28
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,180
oil from Iran while it held 53 American
hostages wasn't allowed to do that

29
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,660
selling to the enemies of the United
States he was pardoned after his wife

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,430
donated hundreds of thousands of dollars
to the Clintons

31
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,900
then you have dangerous criminals
President Clinton pardon Susan Rosenberg

32
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,109
a member of the weathered underground
charges part of a bank robbery that led

33
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:30,799
to a guard and two police officers being
killed drug dealers

34
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:35,969
President Clinton commuted the sentence
of Carlos Vick Nally a central player in

35
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:43,579
a cocaine ring that stretched from
California to Minnesota criminal leaker

36
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:49,439
you've heard the word leaker President
Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea

37
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:56,629
Manning who leaked countless sensitive
and classified documents to Wikileaks

38
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:02,969
perhaps in others but horrible horrible
thing that he did commuted the sentence

39
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:09,269
and perhaps pardoned President Obama
commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez

40
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:15,840
Rivera who was charged as part of a
violent independence group from Puerto

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,159
Rico responsible for 28 Chicago area
bombings and many deaths in the 1970s

42
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:31,560
and 1980s Sheriff Joe is a patriot
Sheriff Joe loves our country sheriff

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,260
Joe protected our borders and Sheriff
Joe was very unfairly treated by the

44
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,419
Obama administration especially right
before an election an election that he

45
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:49,859
would have won so and he was elected
many times so I stand by my pardon of

46
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:54,629
Sheriff Joe and I think the people of
Arizona who really know him best would

47
00:03:54,629 --> 00:00:00,000
agree with me thank you very much
