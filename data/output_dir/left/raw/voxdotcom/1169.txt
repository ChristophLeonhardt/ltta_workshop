1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,300
"We travelled to Leer county and it
was there that we crossed over, by just a mile

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,520
or two, into rebel territory.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,589
And a man approached me.

4
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:16,460
He started describing the horrendous violence
that had happened there.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:24,000
He said government troops came in
and killed his 5 year old child and forced

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,460
him to eat some of her body..."

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,110
That’s Jane Ferguson, a journalist who was
just in South Sudan covering a famine that’s

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:38,120
left about 100,000 people starving and 5.5
million at risk.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,760
She was here in Unity, a state where the UN
officially declared a famine in February 2017.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,010
It's also where the worst violence in South
Sudan’s 4 year old civil war has taken place,

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,309
and that’s not a coincidence...

12
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,550
The violence has destroyed crops and markets
and has forced people to flee.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,030
As a result there’s no food.

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,910
In the past, humanitarian aid has been the
best solution for famines.

15
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,390
But today, the South Sudanese government is
blocking access to much of the country in

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,970
an attempt to starve the rebels.

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,500
It's why South Sudan’s famine is man-made.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,060
And so are the 3 other famines developing
in Nigeria, Somalia, and Yemen.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,860
Wars in these countries are threatening to
starve 20 million people

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,460
"No one country is the same, no one

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,040
conflict is the same, but what we are seeing are some very dangerous patterns; the use of

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,829
food, or lack there of, as a weapon
Fighting groups in each country have created

23
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,079
food shortages to starve each other.

24
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,970
South Sudan became an independent country
in 2011, but fell into civil war just 2 years

25
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,970
later.

26
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,020
It started as a personal rivalry between president
Salva Kiir and former vice president Riek

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,020
Machar.

28
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,880
But with each leader belonging to a different
ethnic group, it soon became a tribal conflict.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,969
What we see now is this war almost
cannibalizing, where its disintegrating into

30
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,170
smaller and smaller groups across the country.

31
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,669
What we saw when we got there is clear evidence of ethnic cleansing."

32
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,080
The government has blocked humanitarian aid
to parts of rebel territory, leaving millions

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,410
of civilians trapped without access to food.

34
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,950
And it’s created chaos.

35
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,160
The fighting has forced tens of thousands
to leave their homes, often for dense marshlands

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,170
that surround cities.

37
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,700
"It’s such a good hiding place but
it’s also where people starve to death.

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,240
They have no means of finding food."

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,061
There’s a similar situation in Nigeria,
where the government’s been fighting the

40
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:37,480
Islamist militant group, Boko Haram since
2009.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,890
The terrorist group controls large portions
of Borno State. And its responsible for mass

42
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,960
killings, suicide bombings, and kidnappings
in the region.

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,980
Their violent tactics have displaced nearly
2 million people and collapsed the agricultural economy.

44
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,180
The Nigerian government restricts aid to keep

45
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,680
supplies from reaching Boko Haram territory,
where civilians continue to be at risk of

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,810
starvation.

47
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,520
Over in Somalia, another al-Qaeda linked terrorist
group al-Shabaab controls at least 10% the

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
country.

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,980
Getting aid to those areas has proven difficult
as well.

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,160
Back in 2011, during the last famine, the
group killed aid workers and looted supply

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
trucks.

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,800
Now a drought has re-created severe famine
conditions in Somalia.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
And limited access to humanitarian aid has made the situation worse.

54
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,220
This time Al-shabaab claims it will allow
people to move and find aid, but if they don’t,

55
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,880
millions will be trapped without food again.

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,950
The clearest example of a man-made famine
is just north of Somalia, across the Gulf

57
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,120
of Aden, in Yemen.

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,011
Civil war broke out in 2014 between the government
and a rebel group called the Houthis.

59
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,590
They’ve received weapons, personnel, and
support from Iran.

60
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,430
In response, Saudi Arabia, Iran’s rival
in the Middle East, intervened in 2015 on

61
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,981
behalf of the government.

62
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:51,430
It began bombing Houthi territory, but also
roads, bridges, and ports to block Iranian

63
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,540
supplies.

64
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,010
Saudis also set up a naval blockade that keeps
85% of the food supplies out of Yemen.

65
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,310
Meanwhile, in the interior, 7 million people
are at risk of starvation.

66
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,920
Yemen's food shortage is caused by internal
conflict but it's controlled by the geopolitics

67
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,270
of the region.

68
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,990
This makes man-made famines incredibly hard
to solve.

69
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:17,250
"So, if it comes down to simply trying to save lives, that’s easy to do, unless you cannot get

70
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:26,070
access, unless there are warring sides trying
to push hunger deliberately on people, and

71
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,360
unless the food simply can’t reach them.

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,440
If you get food to people they won’t starve
to death.

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,000
That's why its not particularly complicated."

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,120
But the crisis is only getting worse.

75
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,040
Massive streams of refugees are overwhelming
neighboring countries.

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,090
Uganda’s BidiBidi camp now holds 800,000
people making it the largest refugee camp

77
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,510
in the world.

78
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,430
Overcrowded camps are breeding ground for
disease, and cholera outbreaks have been reported

79
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,790
across the entire region.

80
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,810
It’s why humanitarian groups are struggling
to keep up.

81
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,270
The UN reports that it needs $4.4 billion
to address the famines, and they've only raised

82
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,300
14% of that so far.

83
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,340
But if the conflicts that are driving these
famines aren’t addressed, no amount of aid

84
00:05:05,340 --> 00:00:00,000
will solve these man-made crises.
