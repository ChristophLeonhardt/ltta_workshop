1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
“These cyber actors are
using social media platforms

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,320
to spread disinformation —”

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,070
“and set Americans
against each other —”

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,800
“targeting both sides of a
country’s most divisive issues.”

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,490
You’re watching
a recent

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,040
Senate Intelligence
Committee hearing

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,000
about how
foreign internet trolls

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,590
are using social media
to influence American politics.

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,200
In the lead-up to the
2016 presidential election,

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,690
Russian trolls used
disinformation campaigns

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,130
to sow discord.

12
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,590
Experts are now seeing
similar activity heading

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,274
into the 2018 midterms.

14
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:30,190
“The trolls are trying
to improve their tactics.

15
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,380
They’re trying to get better
at hiding their traces.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,720
So it’s going to be a
game of cat and mouse.”

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,170
Ben Nimmo is a senior fellow

18
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,640
at the Atlantic Council’s
Digital Forensic Research Lab.

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,040
He works to
identify and analyze

20
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,540
online disinformation.

21
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,680
“The way these accounts work

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,140
has always been a
combination of infiltration

23
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,294
and radicalization.”

24
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:49,960
He walked us through
some of the imagery

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,930
and strategies used by
notorious online trolls

26
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,310
from Russia and,
perhaps, elsewhere.

27
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,480
First, they pick a
hot-button issue.

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,090
“There are certain very
high-profile problems

29
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,360
that American society has,
which are well-known abroad.

30
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,910
And it tended to be those
ones which are targeted.

31
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,580
So the original
troll factory accounts

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,540
were very heavily
engaged in the debate

33
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,850
on gun control and
the Second Amendment,

34
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,220
on women’s rights
and abortion rights.

35
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,040
They were heavily engaged
on Black Lives Matter.”

36
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,500
A slew of inauthentic accounts
that Facebook recently deleted

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,070
took the same approach,

38
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,620
updated to fit
the latest top news.

39
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,820
They use identity politics
and emotion

40
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,430
to appeal to followers.

41
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,720
Next step, tap
into a community.

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,600
“So you start off by
making positive comments

43
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,820
about the target group.

44
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,390
Let’s say you
want to masquerade

45
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,150
as a Black Lives Matter supporter.

46
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,980
You start by making lots
of positive comments

47
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,521
about the
African-American community.

48
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,850
You talk about how
beautiful the girls are.

49
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,580
You talk about their
glorious cultural history

50
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,970
and you try and engage
with real activists

51
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,880
who are busy on this subject.”

52
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,942
Now it’s time to ramp it up.

53
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:57,650
“Once you’ve established
your credentials,

54
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,600
you start slipping
more and more toxic content

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,480
into the mix.

56
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,780
So, rather than
saying positive things

57
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,410
about your community,

58
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,000
you start saying negative things
about other communities.

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,139
The war against
colonialism is a theme

60
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,090
that comes up on this page
time and again.

61
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,990
It’s a hint at violence.

62
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,590
And last,

63
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,170
they try to move from the
online world into real life.

64
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,430
“And then maybe you
slip into the mix a suggestion:

65
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,870
‘Let’s have a protest.

66
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,810
Let’s get real people out
on the streets.’

67
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,340
And then,
because you’re operating

68
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,750
probably from
some time zones away,

69
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,750
you need to think, ‘Well, how
do we get this to happen?’

70
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,124
And you start
trying to reach out

71
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:35,150
to genuine local
organizations.

72
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,510
Maybe you say, ’Well, we can’t
turn up on that day

73
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,780
because we’ve got
something else going on.

74
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,420
Why don’t you
organize this for us?’”

75
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,960
In 2016, Russian trolls
organized political events

76
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,140
for and against both
presidential candidates.

77
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,860
At an Islamic center
in Houston, they organized

78
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,479
a protest and the
corresponding counterprotest.

79
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,999
“Down with the racists!

80
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,439
Down with the Nazis!”

81
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,560
So why go
to such lengths?

82
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,860
These bad actors
are trying to polarize

83
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,970
the American public

84
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,300
by exploiting existing
tensions in our society.

85
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,500
The goal?

86
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,910
Make Americans
see each other as enemies,

87
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,810
especially during high-stakes
events such as elections.

88
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,880
If people feel they can’t
trust their neighbors

89
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,990
or their government,

90
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,860
democracy falters.

91
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,530
“There is a massive,
sophisticated,

92
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,140
persistent campaign
on multiple fronts

93
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,050
to misinform, divide
and ultimately manipulate

94
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,390
the American people.

95
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,820
Is that accurate?”

96
00:03:28,820 --> 00:00:00,000
“Yes.”
