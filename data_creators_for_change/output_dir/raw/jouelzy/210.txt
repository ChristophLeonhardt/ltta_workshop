concise<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the continuation real quick</font>

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,369
inspired by my<font color="#CCCCCC"> pulse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I speak about</font>

9
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,460
Sandra bland and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback that I've</font>

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,260
been getting since posting that video on

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,769
facebook and on you tube you know what I

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">am is very clear but what I understand</font>

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,020
is the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my words and so I am</font>

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">always direct and intentional and what I</font>

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,579
say and I was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear in that</font>

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">video when I said that I have no room to</font>

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,610
make anybody comfortable in not

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,430
discussing the atrocities that happened

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,390
to Sandra bland I am beyond the point of

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,680
allowing people to feel comfortable

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">about ignoring black lives matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,199
one hundred twenty percent beyond the

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,850
point of lying anybody that comfortably

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,610
spew victim shaming respectability

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,070
politics in any discussion especially

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,869
around Sandra bland like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

27
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">time for it it is disheartening to see</font>

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,729
other black women but tell their own

29
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,990
sisters that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bow down and</font>

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,530
keep themselves meek and squash their

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,320
intelligence in order to sustain

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,630
themselves or order to keep their life

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,610
rather than discussing changing the

34
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,250
behavior of the oppressor we want to

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,380
control the behavior of the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,900
that hey you guys sign for it

no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have to respect your opinion</font>

38
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,890
on it I'm not apologizing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,899
passionate I am about this matter I'm

40
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,670
beyond the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where we can sit and</font>

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">cry about a lion now trust you me I</font>

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,979
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's some BS what that dentist</font>

43
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,439
did referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit and have an outcry</font>

44
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,250
and cry over an animal in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zimbabwe and</font>

00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,200
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> even go in touch what</font>

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,600
politically is happening to the people

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,579
of Zimbabwe but<font color="#E5E5E5"> should worry about</font>

48
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,680
aligning who can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even say nothing</font>

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,890
about the black lives matter campaign

50
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,869
I'm not asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to have an</font>

51
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">opinion or to be able to</font>

52
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,740
I have eloquent words to say about this

53
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,860
subject but if we can post memes about

54
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">our IP to a lion and we could take the</font>

55
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,860
time to say our IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bobbi Kristina then</font>

56
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,270
we could take the time to say our IP

57
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,330
Sandra bland it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hard to say</font>

58
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,120
black lives matter it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

60
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,820

<font color="#E5E5E5">that hard to simply acknowledge that</font>

63
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,020
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem I'm not asking for</font>

64
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,800
anybody to have a solution but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,440
step is awareness the second step is to

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,140
have an emotional charge to it and the

67
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,660
third step is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> within anger we</font>

Voting Rights Act of 1965 wasn't a

80
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,350
significant change in allowing
