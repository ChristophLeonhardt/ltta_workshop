â™ª AINSLEY: THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE HEADLINES THIS WEEK SENT A TWEET QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN CONFIRMED WITH THE CONFIRMATION OF KAVANAUGH HE SAYS AND THE PROCESS WHICH LED TO IT AND THE TREATMENT OF MERRICK GARLAND THE LEGITIMACY OF THE SUPREME COURT CAN JUSTIFIABLY BE QUESTIONED. THE COURT MUST NOW PROVE, THROUGH ITS WORKS, THAT IT IS BOTH OF THE NATION'S TRUST. JOINING US NOW IS CHIEF COUNSEL AND POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK AND FORMER LAW CLERK TO JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS CARRIE SEVERINO. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. GOOD TO BE HERE. AINSLEY: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ERIC HOLDER'S TWEET. THAT HAS BEEN THEIR STRATEGY. THEY WANTED IT DENY CONFIRMATION IF THEY COULD. DELAY IT IF THEY COULDN'T DELEGITIMIZE IT. HOPING TO FIND SOME WAY TO PUSH BACK AGAINST WHO IS NOW A CONSTITUTIONALIST MAJORITY. SO THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM EVERY DECISION THEY WANT. THEY WILL TRY TO UNDERCUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COURT. I THINK IT'S IRONIC WHEN YOU HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING OH THIS IS GOING TO DELEGITIMIZE THE COURT. THEY ARE DOING IT BY THEIR OWN RHETORIC. THEY KNOW THIS IS A FAIR AND LEGITIMATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. AS FAIR AS IT COULD BE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE DOING WAS VERY UNFAIR. I SAW FROM MY OWN BOSS, I WORKED FOR JUSTICE THOMAS, YOU KNOW, HE HAD OBVIOUSLY A BRUISING CONFIRMATION PROCESS AS WELL. HE HAS SERVED 27 YEARS NOW WITH DISTINCTION. SO MANY PEOPLE RECOGNIZED HIM AS ONE OF THE MOST PRINCIPLED MEMBERS OF THE COURT. HE GETS ALONG GREAT WITH HIS COLLEAGUES. SO, YOU KNOW, THEIR WISHFUL THINKING THAT SOMEHOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WILL HAVE AN ASTERISK I THINK IS JUST THAT. AINSLEY: WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT DID YOU THINK JUDGE KAVANAUGH MAKING GOOD ON PROMISE HIRING ALL FOUR OF HIS CLERKS ARE GOING TO BE WOMEN. SOMEONE WHO HAS FREQUENTLY HAD A LOT OF WOMEN CLERKS. HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY ABOUT ENCOURAGING WOMEN THIS THEIR CAREERS FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WILL HAVE HAD ALL FEMALE CLERKS. TAKE THAT JUSTICE GINSBURG. AINSLEY: A LOT OF WOMEN LOOKING AT ONE POLL, A LOT OF WOMEN SAYING REPUBLICAN WOMEN THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GO TO THE POLLS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTION TO GO TO THE POLLS AND DEMOCRATS, IT'S ACTUALLY GONE DOWN. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS POLL. IT'S NPR AND PBS MARIST POLL. IN JULY 81% OF DEMOCRATIC WOMEN SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO GO TO THE POLLS. NOW, LOOK AT OCTOBER. 79%. SLIGHTLY DOWN. FOR REPUBLICAN WOMEN 71 PERCENT SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT? JULY. NOW 83% SAY OCTOBER. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? DO YOU THINK THAT'S ACCURATE? YEAH. I MEAN, WHEN I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS IN PARTICULAR, IS SEEING HOW CONCERNED WOMEN HAVE BEEN ABOUT THIS PROCESS. THE DEMOCRATS WILL TELL THAT YOU THERE IS A MONOLITHIC VOICE FOR WOMEN. HONESTLY I'M A CONSERVATIVE WOMAN. I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, TOO. WHEN WE HAVE DONE POLLING IN RED STATES LIKE WEST VIRGINIA, OR ARIZONA, OR NORTH DAKOTA. WE SAW IT WASN'T JUST STRONG MAJORITIES THAT WANT KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED IN GENERAL. STRONG FEMALE MAJORITIES. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO SUSAN COLLINS' SPEECH LAST WEEK, I THINK IT LINED UP VERY CAREFULLY AND THOUGHTFULLY, WHAT A LOT OF WOMEN WERE THINKING WHICH IS WE CARE ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. WE WANT WOMEN TO BE HEARD, BUT WE DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE UNTHINKING SHUT UP MEN LINE LIKE SENATOR HIRONO SAID. WE THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES. THAT'S WHAT SHE DID. I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF AMERICAN WOMEN ARE DOING. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOCALS OF DUE PROCESS. THEY WANT TO SEE THAT
