1
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:01,804
STRATEGY.

2
00:00:01,805 --> 00:00:04,407
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:07,410
ANGLE.

4
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:09,145
AT SOME POINT IN LIFE, WE ALL

5
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:09,879
HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,816
TO BE VICTIMS OR VICTORS.

7
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:16,853
DO WE WANT TO BE DEFINED BY

8
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:17,386
SLIGHTS AND WRONGS?

9
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:19,522
ONES THAT ARE PERCEIVED OR REAL?

10
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:22,024
THAT WE SUFFER AT THE HANDS OF

11
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:23,793
OTHERS.

12
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:26,596
242 YEARS AGO, OUR FOREFATHERS

13
00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:28,197
MADE THE DECISION THAT KIND OF

14
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:29,265
SITTING AROUND BEMOANING OUR

15
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,433
FATE UNDER BRITISH RULE WASN'T

16
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:32,034
GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE.

17
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:32,701
THEY DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING

18
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:34,804
ABOUT IT.

19
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:37,607
WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO CHOSE

20
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:38,441
FREEDOM AND LIBERTY ROOTED IN A

21
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:41,878
SENSE OF VIRTUE OVER DESPAIR AND

22
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,212
HOPELESSNESS.

23
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,581
AND WITH COURAGE, SACRIFICE, AND

24
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:48,951
AN INDOMITABLE SPIRIT AND AN

25
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:50,820
ABIDING FAITH IN GOD, WE WON OUR

26
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,121
INDEPENDENCE AND CREATED THE

27
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:54,257
GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

28
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:55,658
POWERFUL FORCES IN TODAY'S

29
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,027
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THOUGH, ARE AT

30
00:00:58,028 --> 00:00:58,828
WAR WITH THAT FUNDAMENTAL

31
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,630
UNDERSTANDING OF THE AMERICAN

32
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:01,931
STORY.

33
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:03,866
IN FACT, MANY THINK THE FOUNDING

34
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:06,068
OF OUR COUNTRY WAS INHERENTLY

35
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:08,905
CORRUPT AND EVEN ILLEGITIMATE,

36
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:11,841
AND THEY HAVE MADE A DECISION TO

37
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:13,809
RUN AGAINST THAT VERSION OF

38
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,410
AMERICA.

39
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,913
IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ACTUAL PLAN

40
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:18,214
TO GROW AMERICAN PROSPERITY AND

41
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:21,017
KEEP US SAFE, DEMOCRATS ARE

42
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:22,518
EMBRACING VICTIMHOOD AS A

43
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,387
POLITICAL PLATFORM THIS MIDTERM

44
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,622
CYCLE.

45
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:27,356
DEMOCRAT STACEY ABRAMS IS

46
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:30,793
RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN GEORGIA.

47
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:33,129
>> THE MIASMA OF FEAR THAT'S

48
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,830
CREATED BY VOTER SUPPRESSION IS

49
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:35,631
AS MUCH ABOUT TERRIFYING PEOPLE

50
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:38,668
ABOUT TRYING TO VOTE AS IT IS

51
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:39,402
ABOUT ACTUALLY BLOCKING THEIR

52
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:40,503
ABILITY TO DO SO.

53
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:42,605
>> Laura: WHAT IS SHE TALKING

54
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:42,905
ABOUT?

55
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:44,206
VOTER REGISTRATION HAS REACHED A

56
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,008
RECORD LEVEL IN GEORGIA, AND

57
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,276
THERE WAS A 75% VOTER

58
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:50,613
PARTICIPATION THERE IN 2016.

59
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:53,849
THE AVERAGE NATIONWIDE WAS ONLY

60
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,684
55%.

61
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:57,653
ABRAMS IS SELLING FEAR

62
00:01:57,654 --> 00:02:02,024
VICTIMHOOD AT THE IDEA OF,

63
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:03,059
WEIGHT, ILLEGAL ALIENS VOTING?

64
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,994
>> THE THING IS, THE BLUE WAVE

65
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:09,432
IS AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

66
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,634
IT'S WHITE, LATINO, ASIAN

67
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:12,134
PACIFIC ISLANDER.

68
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:13,069
IT'S MADE UP OF THOSE WHO'VE

69
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,836
BEEN TOLD THEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF

70
00:02:13,837 --> 00:02:16,806
BEING HERE.

71
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:20,209
IT'S COMPRISED OF THOSE WHO ARE

72
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,477
DOCUMENTED AND UNDOCUMENTED.

73
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,245
>> Laura: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

74
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:24,747
WAIT A MIDNIGHT TRAIN TO

75
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:25,081
GEORGIA.

76
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:26,282
DID YOU CATCH THAT?

77
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:31,020
SOUNDS LIKE ABRAMS HAD HER --

78
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,721
SAID THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

79
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:34,624
WERE PART OF THE BLUE WAVE.

80
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,425
BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE?

81
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:38,260
HOW DOES THAT NOT DILUTE THE

82
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:39,228
ILLEGAL VOTES OF AMERICAN

83
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,764
CITIZENS OF ALL COLORS AND ALL

84
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:42,264
BACKGROUNDS?

85
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:47,036
IT GETS WORSE.

86
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:48,504
IN MASSACHUSETTS, WHERE FOR

87
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:49,171
YEARS ELIZABETH WARREN HAS

88
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:52,808
SHAMELESSLY PEDDLED THE IDEA

89
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,410
THAT SHE'S A CHEROKEE INDIAN.

90
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:55,478
>> MY MB HAS WALKED BY THAT

91
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,614
PICTURE AT LEAST A

92
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,317
THOUSAND TIMES, REMARKED THAT

93
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,623
HER FATHER, HAD HIGH CHEEKBONES

94
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,258
LIKE ALL OF THE INDIANS.

95
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:09,992
BEING NATIVE AMERICAN HAS BEEN

96
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:13,529
PART OF MY STORY I GUESS SINCE

97
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,865
THE DAY I WAS BORN.

98
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:17,366
>> Laura: WAS SHE BORN IN

99
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,034
1985?

100
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:18,868
I THINK THAT'S WHEN SHE STARTED

101
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:20,636
TO TELL THE STORY.

102
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:21,837
ANYWAY, WARREN IS TRYING TO PLAY

103
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:22,838
THE VICTIM.

104
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,440
AFTER YEARS OF TAKING CRITICISM

105
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:26,342
FOR HER NATIVE AMERICAN CLAIMS,

106
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,544
WARREN, WITH AN ION 2020, TRIED

107
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:30,446
TO GET IT ALL OUT OF THE WAY.

108
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:34,216
SHE RELEASED AND EFFECTIVE VIDEO

109
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:35,518
DURING A DNA SPECIALIST.

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,020
>> WHAT ARE THE FACTS SAY?

111
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,822
>> YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE NATIVE

112
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:40,923
AMERICAN ANCESTRY IN YOUR

113
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:41,290
PEDIGREE.

114
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,425
>> SOME PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONED

115
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:44,160
MY HERITAGE AND MY FAMILY

116
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:44,827
HISTORY.

117
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,429
MAYBE THEY DO IT TO INSULT ME.

118
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,030
MAYBE THEY DO IT TO DISTRACT

119
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:49,832
FROM THE KINDS OF CHANGES I'M

120
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:50,266
FIGHTING FOR.

121
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:53,502
>> Laura: ACCORDING TO A DNA

122
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,171
STUDY, ANALYZED BY STANFORD'S

123
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:57,907
CARLOS BUSTAMANTE, WHO WORKS FOR

124
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:59,742
23 AND MAY, THE ADVISOR OF

125
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:05,114
THAT COMPANY, WARREN IS POSSIBLY

126
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:10,519
1/1024, WHICH IS 0.09% NATIVE

127
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,021
AMERICAN.

128
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,423
THAT'S WHERE THE SCALE GOES.

129
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:16,659
IT GOES FROM .09% TO I DON'T

130
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,828
KNOW, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

131
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,228
ACCORDING TO

132
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,028
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," SCIENTIST

133
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,463
SAY THE AVERAGE

134
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:24,033
EUROPEAN-AMERICAN IS 0.18%

135
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:25,634
NATIVE AMERICAN.

136
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:26,669
SO THAT WOULD MAKE WARREN LESS

137
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,039
NATIVE AMERICAN THAN THE AVERAGE

138
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,207
EUROPEAN-AMERICAN.

139
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:31,841
WAIT A SECOND.

140
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:33,743
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO

141
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,644
LIBERAL CONCERNS ABOUT CULTURAL

142
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:36,078
APPROPRIATION?

143
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,813
I GUESS THAT'S OUT THE WINDOW.

144
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:40,616
WARREN IS KIND OF A TYPICAL

145
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:41,250
DENIGRATE HER.

146
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,785
SHE'S RACIALLY OBSESSED, AND

147
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:46,622
LET'S FACE IT, IT'S EASIER THAN

148
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:47,590
BEING FACTUALLY INFORMED.

149
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,625
SHE IS WILLING TO SCAM THE

150
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,227
SYSTEM, IN THIS CASE PLAY IN

151
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:53,028
INDIAN TO GET A BOOST

152
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,630
PROFESSIONALLY OR IN THIS CASE

153
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,030
POLITICALLY.

154
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:59,668
TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, HER DNA

155
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:00,436
SPECIALIST, CARLOS BUSTAMANTE,

156
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:02,204
FLATLEY ADMITTED THAT HE DIDN'T

157
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:05,808
EVEN USE NATIVE AMERICAN SAMPLES

158
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:06,842
FOR THE TEST.

159
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:07,209
SERIOUSLY?

160
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,644
TO MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF THOSE

161
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,413
SAMPLES, HE IS ONE FROM MEXICO,

162
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:14,016
PERU, AND COLOMBIA.

163
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:15,417
KEEP THIS UP AND WARREN IS GOING

164
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:19,121
TO BE CLAIMING THAT SHE'S MORE

165
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:19,688
LATINA THAN ALEXANDRIA

166
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,657
OCASIO-CORTEZ BY 2020.

167
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:23,826
SPEAKING OF LATINOS, A NEW

00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:24,827
MIGRANT CARAVAN FROM

169
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,228
CENTRAL AMERICA, THE SECOND IN

170
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,831
SIX MONTHS, IS NOW HEADED UP

171
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:30,266
THROUGH MEXICO TO THE

172
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,100
UNITED STATES THIS WEEK.

173
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:34,436
IT ALREADY HAS 1600 MEMBERS.

174
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:35,371
NATURALLY, DEMOCRATS HAVE

175
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:37,406
STARTED THEIR OLD NARRATIVE

176
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,140
ABOUT TRUMP SEPARATING FAMILIES

177
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:40,910
OF THE BORDER.

178
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:44,246
IF ONLY THEY HAD THE SAME

179
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,748
CONCERN FOR AMERICANS BRUTALLY

180
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,183
VICTIMIZED BY ILLEGALS HERE IN

181
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:47,850
THE UNITED STATES.

182
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:51,320
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, TWO

183
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:54,089
ILLEGALS HAVE COMMITTED VICIOUS

184
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,628
RAPES JUST IN THE NEW YORK AREA.

185
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,230
ONE FOLLOWED A NASSAU COUNTY

186
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:04,433
WOMAN HOME, KNOCKED HER OUT, AND

187
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,902
REPEATEDLY RAPED HER FOR ABOUT

188
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:08,237
AN HOUR.

189
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:08,904
THEN THERE'S SOMEONE WHO IS

190
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:11,807
THOUGHT TO BE A MEMBER OF MS-13.

191
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,642
HE BROKE INTO THE BEDROOM OF AN

192
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:15,244
11-YEAR-OLD GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW

193
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:17,479
AND RAPED HER ON A BUNK BED WITH

194
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,281
HER BROTHER BELOW THEM.

195
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:21,617
MEANWHILE, WE HEAR ALMOST

196
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:23,419
NOTHING ON THOSE STORIES OR SO

197
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,620
MANY MORE LIKE THEM FROM

198
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:26,222
DEMOCRATS WHO AT THE SAME TIME

199
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:28,490
AGONIZED OVER NONCITIZENS

200
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,061
OVERWHELMING OUR BORDER PATROL.

201
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,829
WHEN LESLIE STAHL TRIED TO MELT

202
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,464
HEARTS WITH HER FAMILY

203
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,633
SEPARATION NARRATIVE LAST NIGHT,

204
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:38,434
THE PRESIDENT SET HER STRAIGHT.

205
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,070
>> ARE YOU WILLING TO

206
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:43,038
REINSTITUTE THAT POLICY.

207
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,140
YOU SAID WE ARE LOOKING AT

208
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,008
EVERYTHING?

209
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,643
>> President Trump: WHAT I CAN

210
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:49,278
SAY IS THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES

211
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,579
FROM COMING INTO A COUNTRY,

212
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,616
NAMELY OUR COUNTRY, ILLEGALLY.

213
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:55,618
>> I'M NOT GOING TO ASK IT

214
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:55,918
AGAIN.

215
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,619
>> President Trump: YOU DON'T

216
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:56,952
HAVE TO.

217
00:06:56,953 --> 00:07:00,256
IT WAS THE SAME AS OBAMA.

218
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:01,657
>> Laura: DONALD TRUMP HAS

219
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:03,626
EXPOSED THE FRAUDULENT NATURE OF

220
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,461
THE LEFT-WING ARGUMENTS AND

221
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:06,462
THEIR WEAK NARRATIVES.

222
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:07,863
THERE IS A SUDDEN BOUNCE.

223
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:09,965
YOU FELT IN THE "60 MINUTES"

224
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:10,866
INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT.

225
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,735
THE LEFT IS FUMING THAT

226
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,837
60 MINUTES ACTUALLY AIR THE

227
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:15,204
INTERVIEW.

228
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:16,472
BUT HE HAS THE EXTRA BOUNCE IN

229
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:18,474
HIS STEP AND THE SENSE OF HIS

230
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:20,643
PARTY IS NOW ON THE RISE AGAIN.

231
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:21,844
FOLLOWING THE KAVANAUGH BATTLE,

232
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:23,646
YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT SO THAT THE

233
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,247
DEMOCRATS MIGHT'VE GOTTEN THE

234
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:26,649
MESSAGE THAT VICTIMHOOD FOR

235
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,984
POLITICAL GAIN IS NOT A GREAT

236
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:30,452
STRATEGY.

237
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,821
IT WON'T WORK, AND IT HASN'T.

238
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,823
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE

239
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:35,524
REPUBLICANS MAY HAVE FINALLY

240
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:38,827
FOUND THEIR GROOVE.

241
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:41,830
THEY ARE OUTSELLING THE PEACE,

242
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:43,532
PROSPERITY, AND SECURITY AGENDA

243
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,833
THAT TRUMP WON ON AND IS

244
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:45,267
DELIVERING ON.

245
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:45,901
I DON'T KNOW.

246
00:07:45,902 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THE END, I THINK MOST
