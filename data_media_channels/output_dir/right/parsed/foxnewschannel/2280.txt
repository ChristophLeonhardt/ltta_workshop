>> Julie: SO NORTH KOREA
REPORTEDLY MAKING NEW PROMISES
CONCERNING THEIR NUCLEAR TEST
SITE VOWING TO SHUT IT DOWN
AFTER ITS SUMMIT WITH THE SOUTH
AND AHEAD OF A PRESIDENTIAL
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
KIM JONG-UN IS LOOKING FOR A
SECURITY GUARANTEE FROM THE U.S.
IN RETURN.
THE QUESTION IS CAN HE BE
TRUSTED.
>> I THINK IF HE HAS MADE A
STRATEGIC DETERMINATION THAT
NORTH KOREA WOULD BE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.
IT'S UP TO THE NORTH KOREANS TO
SHOW US THEY DO PLAN ON GIVING
UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
>> Julie: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT
KIND OF SECURITY GUARANTEE IS
KIM JONG-UN TALKING ABOUT?
>> I THINK EVENTUALLY IN THE
SHORT TERM, HE'S GOING TO BE
LONGING FOR A SUSPENSION AS THE
TALKS GO ALONG.
THAT'S NOT THE CASE NOW.
AS THE TALKS PROGRESS, HE WILL
BE LOOKING FOR A SUSPENSION OF
MILITARY EXERCISES.
THE DEAL TO BE HAD IN THE
LONG-TERM AND WHAT HE WILL BE
LOOKING FOR IS FOR THE UNITED
STATES TO EITHER GREATLY
MINIMIZE OR COMPLETELY WITHDRAW
TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA.
THAT IS SOMETHING OVER THE
WEEKEND GENERAL MATTIS SEEMED TO
INDICATE COULD BE PART OF A
LONGER TERM DEAL.
>> Julie: THE PROBLEM IS
HISTORY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Julie: SIMILAR PROMISES WERE
MADE IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
HOW IS THIS ANY DIFFERENT?
>> WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN,
THERE WAS THIS INCREMENTAL
APPROACH.
THE NORTH KOREANS WOULD GIVE
SOME CONCESSIONS AND WE GIVE
FUEL AID AND OTHER PIECES, THIS
ADMINISTRATION, WHAT GIVES ME
OPTIMISM, A FEW THINGS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS EXTRACTED
CONCESSIONS THAT MILITARY
EXERCISES WILL CONTINUE.
SANCTIONS WILL STAY IN PLACE AND
THAT I THINK THE BIGGEST PIECE
IS THAT HE HAS INDICATED HE WILL
WALK AWAY.
I CAN SEE THAT BEING FRAMED OUT
IN THREE DIFFERENT
CIRCUMSTANCES.
ONE, IF KIM JONG-UN IS JUST
TRYING TO USE THIS FOR SYMBOLISM
TO BE SEEN AS ON PART WITH THE
PRESIDENT FOR HIS OWN DOMESTIC
PROPAGANDA REASONS, TWO, IF
HE'S -- HE'S TAKING A PLAY OUT
OF THE OLD NORTH KOREAN
PLAYBOOK, LET'S DRAG THIS ALONG.
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT, IF WE
GET BOGGED DOWN WHEN THE
INSPECTORS CAN COME IN, HOW MUCH
NOTICE AND MEANWHILE THE NORTH
KOREAN MISSILE ENNEARS ARE --
ENGINEERS THAT ICBM.
>> Julie: AND HOW ABOUT JAPAN?
DO THEY NEED TO BE ON THE SAME
SIDE?
>> THE SOUTH KOREANS AND THE
JAPANESE STILL HAVE A LOT OF BAD
FEELINGS, SO TO SPEAK, LEFT OVER
FROM WORLD WAR II.
THEY'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE
THAT PRESIDENT MOON WANTS A DEAL
BADLY.
HE'S A PROGRESSIVE AND REALLY
WANT TO OUTREACH TO HIS NORTH
KOREAN COUNTER PARTS.
THE JAPANESE ARE LED BY A
CONSERVATIVE ABE WHO DOES NOT
BELIEVE IN HAVING TALKS FOR THE
SAKE OF IT.
WHAT HE'S WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT
SHORT AND MEDIUM RANGE MISSILES
WILL BE LEFT OUT OF THIS.
THE UNITED STATES WILL BE
WORRIED ABOUT THE ICBM MISSILES
AND THE JAPANESE CONCERNS WON'T
BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
>> Julie: CREDIT GIVEN WHERE
CREDIT DO.
THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT STRIDES
BETWEEN THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
THERE'S CONCERN THAT THIS COULD
BE A PROPAGANDA WIN FOR KIM
JONG-UN TO HAVE A FACE-TO-FACE
MEETING WITH POTUS.
THE GUY NEVER LEFT HIS OWN
COUNTRY.
THEN HE GOES TO CHINA AND NOW
HE'S WILLING TO MEET WITH THE
PRESIDENT.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT.
>> I THINK -- ABSOLUTELY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS EYES WIDE
OPEN.
JOHN BOLTON IS CERTAINLY ON
RECORD AS A NORTH KOREAN SKEPTIC
AND RIGHTLY SO.
AND MIKE POMPEO IS GOING TO TAKE
A VERY TOUGH APPROACH AS WELL,
AGAIN, AS LONG AS THE SANCTIONS
STAY IN PLACE AND OUR FOOT STAYS
ON THE NECK OF THE NORTH KOREAN
ECONOMY WITH CHINESE SUPPORT AND
WITH THE FULL U.N. SUPPORT, I
THINK WE'LL BE IN GOOD SHAPE.
WE HAVE TO HAVE VERIFYING FULL
DENUCLEARIZATION BEFORE WE MAKE
ANY CONCESSIONS.
>> Julie: SOUNDS PROMISING.
I CAN'T LIE.
THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
STRIDE WE'VE SEEN MADE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE KEY HERE -- AND THE
PRESIDENT KNEW THIS -- IS WE HAD
TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE IF THEY GET
THIS PROGRAM IT WOULD MAKE THEIR
