Comox First Nation artist Andy Everson has decided to indigenized Star Wars images and the results are magnificent but now the question arises when are the social justice warriors going to lodge a complaint about ever since politically incorrect work Andy Everson recently decided to put his own unique indigenized take on Star Wars imagery and the results are superb indeed the vast majority of Star Wars fans love the final product the first right of merchandise depicting the Aboriginal themed Star Wars characters sold out quickly in a cbc.ca news story Everson says that growing up in the 70s Star Wars influenced him in numerous ways and eventually the opportunity arose in which he could use his artistic talents to modify the Econo images of Darth Vader the stormtroopers and so on naturally this being 2018 there's a political angle to Everson indigenized the outfits worn by the villains of Star Wars similar to how the empire in the Star Wars universe rules with an iron fist ever since Tate's indigenous peoples are still oppressed in many ways even so being a supporter of freedom of expression I applaud ever since artwork he's a gifted artist and given that the t-shirts displaying his craft work are being snapped up by Star Wars fans the world over there's clearly a market demand for this product but even so I must ponder the question what's wrong with this picture because isn't the whole idea of taking something created by others and embracing it or modifying it the very definition of cultural appropriation indeed I don't think Star Wars creator George Lucas is native not even 1/32 Cherokee a la Elizabeth Warren oh and speaking of Pocahontas the Star Wars franchise is now owned outright by Disney yes the same Disney company that was raked over the coals by certain native groups and the progressive left for its animated Pocahontas movie back in 1995 meanwhile last year alone we witnessed numerous temper tantrums from the progressives regarding alleged cultural appropriation evidently if you're a white woman you're not allowed to wear hoop earrings and if you're not an Aussie Aboriginal well don't even think about throwing a boomerang around and if you're a gringo hell don't you dare start cooking and shelah 'das and I don't think cultural appropriation works in Reverse which is to say anything created by Caucasians falls into the realm of public domain so Everson won't be condemned by the usual suspects in the first place by the way I don't have a problem with any cultural appropriation it's been happening for millennia now and should be regarded as praised for a culture not an act of thievery imitation is the sincerest form of flattery after all and I don't think ever sin is against cross pollenization either he says in the CBC piece that his Star Wars art drew inspiration from history adding that when First Nations traded with the Europeans for clothes they often found ways to put their own crest figures on them or add button designs and this is where the cultural appropriation zealots should give their heads a shake for this is really a story of an indigenous person working in tandem not just with an iconic slice of science fiction but something that bridges the gaps between people be it film art literature or music the end result is not appropriation but rather a unique creation and a tale of how two disparate groups working together can enhance each other's endeavors it's Plus+ not a matter of one group taking away from another which sadly always seems to be the lefts narrative these days for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks if you like that video please click Subscribe below and never miss another rebel rant you
