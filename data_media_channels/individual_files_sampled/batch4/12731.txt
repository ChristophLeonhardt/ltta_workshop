one of the things that I think is driving apart the country is it's not a referendum on on the president so much as it's a referendum on evangelical Christians and religious Jews and people who are overlooking at least publicly some of the president's sins in order to maintain a level of I think emotional support because I think you can intellectually support what the president does on policy and still say Rebbie Jackson the schmuck right here and it's that it's that gap that I think is really driving away young people particularly with regard to President Trump well I I don't want it to be driven away I I mean I'm her I am you know this is when you said we agree on 99.9 percent this might be the point one where we have a difference i I admire the religious community for sticking with Donald Trump I have defended them in writing a great deal whether it's whether it's religious Christians or Jews because they understand what's at play here the the fate of the United States of America the last best hope of humanity is is at risk here I'm not saying they shouldn't vote for him mind you I'm not saying they should it's so fine so look when he sins should they should they say that was bad what he just did yes that's fine but but it and and many do but they try to keep a perspective and this is where I know I am NOT for saying this I believe there's a civil war in the United States there is no joy in my saying this I've said this for years now I pray that it remains nonviolent I don't know if it will I think there's a lot of people on the Left who if they could get away with it would hurt physically hurt the people on the right and more so than the other way around as Alan Dershowitz Hillary Clinton supporter lifelong Democrat lifelong liberal said to me and it is on it's on video in his apartment in Manhattan last year he said let me tell you something as a Jew as an American as a liberal I don't fear a handful of Nazis they mean nothing I fear the far left and that's how I feel and and the far left is taking out Nazis and not taking over the Republican Party that's an absurdity it's it's a libel it's stupid but the far left is taking over their democratic so there's a civil war and I am NOT going to spend my time criticizing the only guy who has saved me from losing the country because they've been any other Republican and by the way I was against him I was and it's all in print I was against him during the entire primary I said I but I said from my first article if he wins the the nomination I'll support him because there's no choice but that there is there is such a war at stake right now nobody else would have defeated Hillary Clinton he was the only one I believe I don't think Ted Cruz would have I don't think Marco Rubio would have I don't believe Jeb Bush would have and and that was the brink Supreme Court wise values wise you name it that was the brink for this country so in light of that a moronic tweet or at or an awful statement is is is is very small because here's my bigger issue
