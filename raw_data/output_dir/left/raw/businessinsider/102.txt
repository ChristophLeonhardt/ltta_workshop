category<font color="#CCCCCC"> of test known as laboratory</font>

79

86
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,860
what are known as LD<font color="#CCCCCC"> T's because we're</font>

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,739
early 2010 it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was running out of options</font>

lie with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the retail partner and so they</font>

104
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,489
started courting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Walgreens and they told</font>

we want to partner with you and and

192
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:44,220
of what went wrong with this story is

193
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">bye-bye really draping herself in the</font>

it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of the time to behave</font>
