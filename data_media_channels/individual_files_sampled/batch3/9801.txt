JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS VIRGINIA CONGRESSMAN WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOOD MORNING, MARIA. WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT WITH YOUR TALK REQUEST ROD? WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR HIM. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THERE IS NO LIMITATIONOVER NO LIMITATION OER NO LIMITATION ONR NO LIMITATION ON THE SCOPE. IT'S LIMITED TO THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM AND IN A CLASSIFIED SETTING. WE'LL HAVE A COURT REPORTER PRESENT WITH A SECURITY CLEARANCE. WE'LL HAVE A TRANSPORTATION OF THAT INTERVIEW AND WE'LL TURN THAT OVER TO THE INTELLIGENCE. WE'LL CHECK TO SEE WHAT CAN BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. WE'LL SEE THE INTERVIEW IN IT'S CLASSIFIED FORMAT. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS WE HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF ABOUT MR. ROSENSTEIN MEETING WITH A GROUP OF DOJ AND FBI EMPLOYEES AND TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WEARING A WIRE WHEN HE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT TRUMP OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PULLING TOGETHER CABINET MEMORANDUM IF WE CAB MET MEMORANDUM IF WE CAB MEM MEMORANDUM IF WE CAB MEMBEEMORANDUM IF WE CAB MEMBERSORANDUM IF WE CAB MEMBERS TANDUM IF WE CAB MEMBERS TONDUM IF WE CAB MEMBERS TO IUM IF WE CAB MEMBERS TO INV IF WE CAB MEMBERS TO INVOKF WE CAB MEMBERS TO INVOKE WE CAB MEMBERS TO INVOKE TE CAB MEMBERS TO INVOKE THE 25th AMENDMENT OF THE CONCENTRATE CONSTITUTION. THESE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS. WE HAVE ALL OF THIS BASED ON A NEWS PAPER REPORT. WE HAVE THIRD PARTY TESTIMONY WE HEARD IN OUR INVESTIGATION. HE MET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN SATISFIED AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE ON HIS NUMBER TWO AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE CONGRESS HAS OVER SITE RESPONSIBILITY. WE'LL ASK HIM ABOUT THAT ALONG WITH OTHER THINGS. Reporter: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS TOO. THEY KNOW ROSENSTEIN SIGNED OFF ON THE FIE FISA WARRANT. WE KNOW, YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT A LOT OF DOCUMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THEY HAVE BEEN SLOW WALKING THEM. FIRST, LET ME PUSH BACK ON WHAT YOU SAID, YOU SAID IT WILL BE OPEN AND BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK TO YOUR COLLEAGUES. SOME ARE COMPLAINS ABOUT HOW THIS WILL GO. JIM AND ANOTHER MEMBER SAID THEY HAVE BEEN BLOCKED. WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR TASK FORCE WE'LL ASK ANY QUESTIONS THEY PUT FORWARD TO US AND THIS IN FACT WAS A PROPOSAL THAT THE CHAIRMAN AND I PUT FORWARD TO GET A FULL TRANSPARENT DISCUSSION IN A CLOSED ROOM WHERE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK ANY QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ASKED AND NOT HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT NOT BEING IN A CLASSIFIED SETTING. DID HE SET UP THE IDEA IT COULD ONLY BE YOU AND A FEW OTHERS IN THE RADIO. OH, NO. THAT WAS OUR PROPOSAL. OKAY. JIM IS CONCERNED ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS. HE JOINED US LAST WEEK. WE HAVE TO GET YOUR REACTION. WE NEED HIM TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ISSUES. HE SPOKE ABOUT RECORDING THE COMMANDER AND CHIEF AND THE 25th AMENDMENT. BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT SPOUSAL PIE OR PIE PRE PRIORITY. WAS HE WORRIED ABOUT WEARING THE MIC. WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TALKED TO ANYBODY IN THE ROOM YET. WE SPOKE TO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK THEM ABOUT THE INFORMATION WE GARNERED FROM THOSE FOLKS. WE ALSO KNOW, AS YOU KNOW, HE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT AND IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THE CONGRESS AS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND WE'LL BE ASKING THOSE SAME QUESTIONS. IT WASN'T OPEN TO THE MEDIA OR ANYONE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONVERSATION OR THE PRESIDENT WAS. WE HAVE THOSE AND MORE REAL RELT WE HAVE THOSE AND MORE REAL RELD TO THE INVESTIGATION. CONGRESSMAN RATCLIFF JOINED US LAST WEEK AFTER HE DID TWO INTERVIEWS HE TWEETED OUT THERE. AFTER MY INTERVIEW WITH JAMES BAKER I'M CONVINCED THE FBI AND DOJ HASN'T MET THEIR OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE FACTS. NUMBER TWO LEAKED INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA. THEY VIOLATED THEIR OWN RULES. THEY HAD A BUNCH OF TRUMP HATING AGENTS AND LAWYERS TELLING PRESIDENT TRUMP HE WASN'T UNDER INVESTIGATION WHEN HE WAS. YOUR THOUGHTS? THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT. WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK MR. ROSENSTEIN ABOUT THIS MATTER. HE WAS INVOLVED WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE THIRD RENEWAL OF THE FISA WARRANT APPLICATION. THIS IS REQUESTING A COURT IN SECRET TO APPROVE AWARE SECRET TO APPROVE A WRE SECRET TO APPROVE A WIRETAP ON AN INDIVIDUAL. THIS WENT ON FOR A FULL YEAR. THE LAST THREE MONTHS HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE APPROVAL. WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND BE SURE TO ASK PLENTY OF QUESTIONS. WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THEY HELD BACK INFORMATION. THEY DIDN'T PRESENT IT. THEY REFUTED COLLUSION BUT DIDN'T GIVE IT TO THE COURT. IS THAT WHAT YOU SAW? I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO SUGGEST WHAT HE'S SUGGESTING IS A SERIOUS CONCERN AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO RESPOND WELCOME BACK. I'M HERE WITH CHAIRMAN BOB GOOD LATTE. WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT THIS? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE A LOT OF WITNESSES WITH LOT OF WITNESSES WETH LOT OF WITNESSES WE ARE ABLE TO TALK TO AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. SO, WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A LOT OF USEFUL INFORMATION. THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON TOOK THE FIFTH AND HIS TESTIMONY MAY TEND TO INCRIMINATE THEM. THIS IS JUST ONE MORE WE'LL LOOK INTO ALL OF THESE MATTERS. AFTER THE ELECTION WE'LL PROCEED WITH A REPORT OF OUR FINDINGS. THAT'S TRUE IF REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS ARE IN THE MAJORITY. THE NEW CHAIRMAN CAN CONTINUE THAT WORK BE IN JANUARY. YOU ALSO HAVE A SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. YOU HAVE AN INSPECTOR GENERAL. YOU HAVE WARRANT ABUSE ALLEGATIONS. THIS IS A GOOD POINT. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN BE YOU WILL BE IN THE ROOM ON WEDNESDAY AND JERRY YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AGENDA. IN TWO AND HALF WEEKS TIME THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE INTENTIONS MIGHT BE. THEY WOULD BE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE OVER SITE AND WE'LL CONTINUE THIS INVESTIGATION. YOU THINK YOUR INTERIM REPORT AFTER THE MIDTERMS WILL BE ENOUGH TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WILL THE PRESIDENT DECLASSIFY THE DEMOCRATS YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR IN TERMS OF DECLASSIFYING IT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? WE URGE THE PRESIDENT TO DO THAT. IT'S MY EXPECTATION HE WILL DO THAT AT SOMETIME. NEXT WEEK IN TERMS OF THE PRIORITY IT'S THE WEARING OF THE WIRE AND WHAT ELSE? IT'S THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF MEETINGS WHICH IS WHAT MR. ROSENSTEIN SUGGESTED. WE'LL MEET AND TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE THINGS. WE SAID NO, YOU HAVE TO BE UNDER OATH. IT HAS TO BE A TRANSCRIBED INTERVIEW WITH QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS GIVEN. WE ALSO HAD PUBLIC HEARINGS WHERE HE REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. SO, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY IN THE APPROPRIATE SETTING TO ASK ALL OF THOSE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CONDUCT OF AN INVESTIGATION THAT BEGAN LONG BEFORE HE BECAME INVOLVED. HE WAS AT THE CRUX OF IT WHEN
