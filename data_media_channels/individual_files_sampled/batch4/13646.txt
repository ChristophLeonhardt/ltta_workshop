today we are joined by the former host of zonation on PJTV the current host of the zoloft the current drummer for 20-pound sledge and author of Pulitzer Prize winning political treatise weapon of ass destruction the one and only so Rachel we will analyze why the left can't take a joke then Arielle Davidson and Jacob arey joined the panel of deplorable z will discuss the convenient changes to hysterical global warming predictions the Google memo guys admiration for KKK titles and Jimmy Kimmel's latest humorless political rant his latest one not the one from yesterday the new one and finally all of your questions will be answered in the mailbag I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show before we get into it with zou we have to we have to just set all of this up yesterday we played Kimmel and Kimmel was whining about some political nonsense so he's back at it again today this is his latest threat to pound the Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade let's show it he asked me to write a blurb for his book which I did he calls my agent looking for projects he's dying to be a member of the Hollywood elite the only reason he's not a member the poly woody leaves because nobody will hire him to be one and you know the reason I'm talking about this because my son had an open heart surgery nice to have two more and because of that I learned that there are kids with no insurance in the same situation I don't get anything out of this Brian you phony little creep oh wow how do you when I see you what did I watch what am i watching I though this is supposed to be a comedy show it is funny I guess it's funny to laugh at him rather than with Jimmy Kimmel we are so lucky to have so raychel here today so first question why has the left lost its sense of humor you know there was a time when they were funny huh they I mean there was I don't know maybe right no know what I mean we had TV shows you know it's it sucks when you find out that these people that you thought were so funny you don't remember kids you sneak downstairs wing you know in the basement or something we watch their shows these guys are hilarious and then you get older and you find out what their views are and it's on such a discipline real letdown yeah that's like why is the host of the man show with the juggies who just like shotguns beers on camera why is he lecturing me they're supposed to be like oh well I guess that's their idea of being pro women while they have these chauvinistic shows but yeah they'd have lost their sense of humor you know whatever that was and why that is you know for I think possibly is because they want to seem be seen as something deeper than comedians all the while hiding behind being a comedian because when they get called out we're trying to make there's you know they're they're deep political statement and it back lashes on it's like well I'm just a comedian you guys I'm just as if you Jon Stewart thing I'm an entertainer clown nose on glass cake and eat it too that's it that is you know it's what's weird because I first I thought the reason they're losing their minds and they're not making jokes anymore is because they hate Trump Trump's been the big change but they were kind of funny under Bush there was Jon Stewart there was Colbert they were both pretty funny so what what is it about Trump it's not just any Republican right well I guess Trump is funny without even trying because it's with Trump you know he doesn't exactly really says much he's not he says anything really deep you know not trying to come down just does it you know and it causes them to start biting or you know you know chomping and stuff like that to try to get under his skin but it's happening it's backfiring and it's causing him to get under their own skin as their head goes up there oh never mind yeah there's a lot going on anatomically the you're right though yeah well you make the point about Trump's just not taking it but he's also he is funny himself yeah so he'll set you know in that debate you were that debate with megyn kelly and she says you've said this about women and you've said this and this and this about women and he just leans him he says only Rosie O'Donnell punchline and I don't know maybe it's they're not used to hmm a guy and he's he's one of them right he is a Hollywood elite he's been a celebrity forever right he was sort of a Democrat and so he's funny and they can't take it they don't know how to react right when someone can throw it back just as well as they can throw it but it's amazing to I mean you've been you've been around Hollywood a very long time the way that Kimmel talks about he says Brian Kilmeade wants to be in the Hollywood elite he wants to be but he's a loser because he's not in the Hollywood elite well the funny thing he said was that they won't hire it was like I didn't know that you got hired to be I was like is that like all the application of the job I'm here for the job to be a Hollywood and lead I didn't know that's how I worked on monster.com I said like yeah the ideal job would be Hollywood elite my qualifications I'm divorced multiple times and I do a lot of drugs will that get me that would look good on a resume through Hollywood really and easy I just you know they won't admit that hey maybe he's just not willing to do the brown nosing that they did to get to where they are you know just you know really kissing their behinds of the right people to get to where they are and it is so you've been in Hollywood a long time and you basically are you were at the forefront of conservative new media right you get to skate you're doing videos on like MySpace you're completely cutting edge in conservative commentary and then Breitbart discovered you Andrew Breitbart some of the other people bill Whittle all those guys discover you I guess so because of MySpace well that's going back you were doing you're doing videos on like Telegraph's you know you know but you were right at the beginning in this conservative internet culture that's where you are yeah well I was doing MySpace that was like like 2007 and you know started to take off a bit and in some I didn't even know about YouTube that's how under a rock I was it uh somebody say you should put this stuff up on YouTube but when I did they started going viral and uh you know I got contacted by some people long story short I ended up on PJTV you know so I was I was uh I guess one of those lonely people in front of my brick wall you know doing this uh you know rant from a conservative angle and it was well-received at the time and it those guys Andrew Breitbart you know it was kind of at the forefront of all of that but PJTV Roger Simon Bill Whittle all those guys were doing something completely new the Conservatives had been shut out of the media shut out of the mainstream comedy politics entertainment culture and then this internet exuberance happens and you break through how is it different today than it was in 2007 well it's different because I guess you know the as I call them the liberal internet overlords you know who basically facilitated these platforms you know for us to do that you turn by YouTube but you yeah man you know it uh when they realized that our voice was that you know potent what changed was is that they started putting limits on it and I you know I'm not trying to toot my own horn in I kind of been saying for a while sigh I don't think we should be dependent on their platforms that much as much no or as much as we are I think we need to create something competitive where we can have our own so in case you know they decide to you know drop the curtain on us you know we have you know some recourse and right now you know we're feeling the effects of that and you know we have all the time on alie Stuckey Millenial Fleck his talks all these big right-wing youtubers crowd or knock a cherry and they're they're revenues are being cut by sixty seventy percent our revenues have been cut dramatically this so they're clearly going after that the the funny thing I was struck with I was looking at some of your early videos today this is a video from 2010 from zonation and this is weird illegal immigrants and their so-called sympathizers believe they're being mistreated by our American government wait isn't it the government of the country you left the one that mistreats you yeah I believe it is why don't you protest that government the government of your country of origin treats its citizens like crap and you take it out on us and a lot of what that is is catharsis your life sucks and trust me you don't have to be poor for your life to suck but your life sucks and this is an event for you to bit your frustration and look for any excuse to whine about how much your butt hurts and drag as many people as you can into your misery you got these angry protestors running around with their hoodies on look like a bunch of little you know bombers acting a straight fool because they reckon if they throw enough of a hissy fit they'll get their way that video was made seven years ago that could have been made seven hours ago exactly what is the main story in the news right now does anything change does anything ever change in politics no no no it doesn't and and that's the thing man this has been going on since since God knows when and it just it gets recycled and we know how you know liberals love recycling this is recycled over and over again this is the first time that I think I'd be willing to recycle is to pull back some of these videos that's so so where's it gonna head where's it I mean right now your your drummer for 20-pound sledge you you're still putting up videos even though YouTube's trying I just squeeze them and crush them as much as they can yeah where does it head the conservative movement the conservative and entertainment movement you know these satirical videos that come out what's the future look like for it or are we gonna be just totally squeezed out and have to come up with our own platform well I think it's definitely gonna have dirt it's gonna take another platform it's gonna take being independent you know with our work and it's gonna take that support man it's it's a you know the idea of I'm looking at what the Liberals have done you know this is what they do and this is what they still do to promote their ideology they're in everything everything and conservatives really have to learn how to compete in that arena support because you know we're so big on defense you know we want you know we're Pro defensive so well you're gonna need a defense mechanism in the cultural arena to not just in the military right don't worry if you want to sustain political conservative representation well you're gonna have to have cultural representation to be underneath that too you know for them to consent you know if we're you know governed by our consent we're gonna have to have a culture that consents to that but we don't have that and what is your Christian you obviously play Christian music you Christianity is in a lot of your videos what is conservatism to you conserver doesn't mean is is uh you have to understand that you can't have your freedom at the forced expense of somebody else when you recognize what the Constitution is and what and what laws it recognizes but not what laws it creates that that uh facilitates the rights of man but the laws that it recognizes given by our Creator when you recognize that and say that okay there is a balance of freedom here you're free to do this now I know that a lot of libertarians like really appreciate this yeah that's right but no it's conservatism because you have this set of freedom that goes against this set of freedom and it has to balance those so say for instance like libertarians gonna get mad at me but I have to I have to give this example like they'll say uh you know what a woman does what her body should be her business yeah right this is you know and the government shouldn't have any say but here's the thing that woman's right to do that is affecting someone else's right what I thought the baby was just like a little scab or something there's like a little two piece of tissue that is attached to the one yeah but you know even a lot of libertarians will say that look I personally am NOT pro-abortion but what a person but the thing is you can't say that without the only reason why you would say that is recognizing a person who the kids why you can say that whenever I hear that this is what I hear I hear well I would never kill my beautiful little precious child but I would love all of those poor people to get rid of theirs so I don't need to ask for their welfare that's what I hear every time they say that argument you have to ask well why wouldn't you do it why wouldn't you and then when you once you go down that road if you feel like you're entitled to kill the kid you're gonna feel entitled for somebody else to pay for it so it's a self eating snake and it doesn't really follow something who's that's why I say you have a conservative interpretation of the Constitution that recognizes this balance of rights in a creator exactly you know it's this isn't a man-made ordinance you have to have the acknowledgement that we're endowed with this or this is an inherent right that's put there by our Creator so I totally buy it let's get some other views on what conservatism is we have Ariel Davidson coming to us from Skype from the Hoover instead tuition and the Daily wires very own Jacob areas joining on the couch I were so lucky Jacob you get to sit next to royalty like this in studio Ariel's coming to us from the Hoover Institution what do you think make the right point I want these two questions one why is the left so unfunny and what does conservatism to you well why is it so unfunny well I think they I think it really comes down to the fact that victimhood is now the most celebrated virtue on the left end of the spectrum so they prioritize not offending anyone as the ultimate good but in the same token being a person who is offended is also seen as an ultimate good and so comedy is inherently I think politically incorrect and so there is gonna they're definitely going to butt heads in terms of what comedies objectives are and what the less ultimate objectives are you know if we look back at comedians like John Cleese Jerry Seinfeld Chris Rock all of these gentlemen won't perform on college campuses anymore they explicitly won't because they think that college campuses have become too conservative and not too conservative in the sense that everyone's voting Republican they're too conservative in the sense of what's allowable and what's not allowable um conservatism to me in general I you know I think that we go back to you know the founding fathers and their principles if we go back to Irish Italian views and John Locke I look at conservatism from the mindset of you are your rights do not come from the government they come from God and they are inherent to you and they're not something gifted by daddy government and this is something that you know when did we talk about freedom of speech freedom of religion the right to bear arms these are not gifts that the government bequeathed upon us these are things that we inherently have as human beings the right to life being a huge one that we just talked about so conservatism to me is really you know government is a social compact agreement that we enter into as individuals we give up a little bit of power over ourselves but in general you know I think restoring the power of the individual is what should be the objective of the conservative movement moving forward absolutely and I think that's why those two questions are pretty related what is conservatism and why has the left lost its sense of humor I think there is in comedy there's an ultimately conservative base to it even though a lot of comedians are left-wing they'll vote for Democrats though some of the greatest do not the greatest comedian of 20th century Bob Hope was a Republican the greatest living comedian right now is Norm ik dot old avoids political classification but the guys at least not a liberal Democrat and I the reason I think is that the conservative view of the world is non-ideological it kind of accepts the world for what it is it accepts the fatik tragic fact of life in effect it accepts our fallen nature as people and then it makes jokes about that it subverts your expectation to have a comedic ending but with people who are utopian or with people who are constantly idealistic or deeply ideological there's no you can't make a joke about that they delve so far into the absurd so far away from what we know is our lived experience of the world that you can't laugh at it there's no standard against which to laugh well if you think there's also this belief that you're making a joke about something that you're inherently degrading it and the left has sort of ascribed this idea of universal values that everything is equal just different and so if you're inherently making fun of something or poking fun on it you're degrading it and thereby saying one culture a belief system practice is better than the other and that's a big no-no in terms of leftist logic so I think it kind of circles back to this idea of universal values which is a very popular notion on the left and actually within sort of the neoconservative movement as well I'd say too but that's a standard liberals don't stick to go II you know they you know as the saying goes if liberals didn't have a double standards they would have any standards at all as far as conservatives go you know I don't think we're as opportunistic opportunistic as people try to make us out to be and looking to try to so that because if we were we would have a smorgasbord of parity and lampooning because the that's what they give us all day long they give us stuff to joke about all day long and it's almost tragic that there isn't like something to just constantly we should have just like an army a legion of people you know making fun of these people you're on the front lines because you're doing a great job of it something what we need more you see you're too unique through your own good man this you know usually I'll only bring on the all-female panels of these beautiful women to come on every single day but it's nice every once in a while to get some guys on to finally give me a compliment we need to get to the very important news this actually is great news today according to courts as of April 2017 the IPCC the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is carbon budget for keeping temperature rise below 1.5 degrees centigrade was approximately 160 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide now a new study published in Nature Geoscience seems to have changed the game it suggests that the 1.5 degrees centigrade carbon budget may now be closer to 800 billion metric tons that would buy the world as much as 20 years at current emissions levels all of that summed up means that the Paris climate Accord was sold to us that we must sign it now if we wait even one single minute the entire world will explode now is the time we're the ones we've been waiting for then Trump says no he says sorry too bad and now they say well ok we have a little bit more time but you really have to do it now now is the time forget what we said before this is the real one mmm Jacob that is pretty convenient everybody says that we have to sign onto that Accord and now they seem to move the needle is that what they're doing is this just absolutely moving goal posts completely cynical or are they really just confused about the science I honestly think they're just moving goalposts there every time they said something up it either doesn't happen or it's an anecdotal event and so they move it back every every so often they do this every five years I was reading somewhere that I believe it was in the Guardian they said we really need to talk about global warming because of this new science I think Leonardo DiCaprio donated 20 million dollars to fund some research and I said what a waste of money you know give us a good movie you could use that 20 million dollars for but but I guarantee you 20 20 years down the road when your show enters its 20th season the three of us will have this conversation you'll be asking are they going to move the goalposts again and I'll say I'll just repeat this over and over I guess the rapture is gonna happen on Mother ologist predict but if not for that yeah I don't think global warming would be the thing to take us down Ariel from this same article from the same report they say that the range of prediction on how much carbon dioxide will be the threshold is between 200 negative 200 billion tons and positive 1,000 billion tons that is a pretty wide range isn't that undergirding their own point that perhaps the chaotic systems and complex systems like the climate are not predictable 100 or 200 or 500 years in the future absolutely I think what it comes down to is that this study is pretty validating for climate skeptics you know it's and when I say climate skeptics I'm not saying that people don't think the environment goes through some sort of cyclical changes I would I agree with that that's a given but I do think we need to take a hard look at the science that's being used and clearly you know if the study is coming out and it's questioning the sort of level or pace of warming that the earth is going through that maybe we should be sitting down and pausing especially for making tremendous decisions about our own economy and the global economy in general based off of these scientific studies wait you're telling me that just because all the models are or constantly getting it wrong and they're constantly changing we shouldn't destroy the entire global economy for them really done because people sort of you know they say if you at all are questioning the science science if you had all are questioning the science then you are an idiot you're a bigot you're minded you're willing to destroy the earth no I just want to have a frank and honest conversation about you know what kind of regulations are we putting in place and are they actually gonna be effective of what we're trying to do and furthermore what is it that we're trying to do right I mean what what is the impact of mankind on the climate do we really know is that something that is quantifiable but Arielle you certainly would agree that if you don't get down on your knees and worship the science then you are a sinner damage to hell right yes okay you better get owning my dear so long before the left changes its model again would you say like 15 minutes or a day or two I think that's a good measure right there that's good vintage and it all sounds like 800 billion metric tons of crap man it's like there's eight hundred metric billion metric tons of crap holding us together right now you know and I like watching the Science Channel you know and III did not you want to talk about people who contradict themselves you know all the Bible contradicts is no the Science Channel contradicts itself yeah their whole thing is that they want to colonize Mars right but they say that Mars has gone through global warming and I'm like how is I are we so evil that we cause global warming or mad before you even started we had we were worse than I thought it's almost like that person's I gained ten pounds just thinking about pie it's like dude did we cause global warming there just thinking about terraforming yeah no Morris gained eight hundred billion metric thinking about it yeah absolutely right well I know you all want to hear the most important news which is Google memo writer James - Morris comments about the KKK you want more Arielle you want more Jacob Barry maybe you definitely want more as Oh Rachel but you can't get it unless you go to daily wire.com right now you gotta go we thank you all of the current subscribers and you can go over and watch the rest of the show but if you're on Facebook and YouTube you're on the fence you say I don't know if I want to subscribe it's ten dollars a month or 100 dollars a year I guess it's not that much but what do I get will you get me okay you get the Andrew Klavan show yeah you get the Ben Shapiro ah fine this this is what you get the leftist tears tumblr this is the most beautiful vessel for leftist tears in the entire country we have a Jimmy Kimmel vintage right now that we're offering in this you can serve Jimmy Kimmel's tears hot or cold always salty and delicious and it's indestructible it's made out of crushed up steven crowder mugs so we've we've boiled them down to their essence good luck trying to destroy this thing go over there right now daily wire calm we'll be right back the engineer fired for anti diversity Google memo his name is James d'amour has now sparked outrage by branding KKK titles cool he said quote the KKK is horrible and I don't support them in any way but let's negate sentences but can we admit that their internal title names are cool eg Grand Wizard he also said you know you've moralized an issue when you can't criticize its heroes or acknowledge any positive aspect of its villains and finally he said quote if you make the actual KKK the only place where you can acknowledge the coolness of Dungeons and Dragons terms then you'll just push people into the KKK so which is less cool the KKK or Dungeons & Dragons oh man can we throw in a third category of KKK playing Dungeons & Dragons yeah that would be that would be a level of the Grand Wizard playing with the Grand Wizard absolutely I actually don't know which I know less about the KKK or Dungeons & Dragons but I don't think either I think you know learning about dungeon dragon you'll learn all you need to know about the KKK and which which is important you know if I may you know on a sober you know let's make a distinction about you know cuz people want to say that KKK or some you know radical Christian organization it's like look you don't have an organization that has titles like Grand Wizard exalted Cyclops form of centaurs you know that have that have these pagan names that you will not find in the Bible it's not a Christian organization it's a it's a fraternity it's built that has its hierarchy built more on paganism oh like the old writer yeah there's nothing to do with us and to in terms of nicknames for the KKK they already have the best and most appropriate nickname for themselves the invisible Empire the Democrats are the invisible Empire they're the ones who created the KKK and you don't and it's like it's amazing if people don't see what they do you know it's like you don't see the man behind the curtain and just like the Democrats you know who have founded a KKK if they don't like what you're doing they'll make you invisible that's why consumption disappear and it's true they share all of the same premises the the importance of identity politics the need of creating more racial disharmony country and they were founded as the terrorist wing of the Democratic Party and also there did how they despised the Jews same thing you Democrats today they despised well everybody hates the Jews so I think you would have throughout all of history from the beginning of time to the present think it's because they're God's people everybody hates them that's like the Bible tells us that's going to happen Jacob is James dumb more serious or is his comment esoteric and perhaps ironic merely trying to provoke a reaction from the left I think he's just trying to get his 15 minutes of fame back honestly yeah I am going to 16 or 17 yeah fair enough I honestly think whenever he first came on conservatives radars I was like guys this guys have left us I mean I guess a liberal maybe not a full-on leftist but he read the whole memo like he really goes after religious people and so I honestly think this is just another him just trying to do something just to stir up so he'll be in the news again I I think like you said it's just esoteric just trying to gin up more controversy mmm-hmm ariel is it is jacob right is it just these 15 minutes of fame or is he is he trying to make a point does he have any point that we should be able to say that some aspect of a terrorist organization is interesting or admirable or something like that or is he just an attention to what we've talked about a few prior shows and what we talked about before basically looking at if you're saying if you say anything radical or you know crazy or stupid you'll get enough attention and all publicity seems to be good with let's say now because then you'll trend on twitter and you'll have people talking about you and blogging about you and putting out puff pieces about you and you know what honestly i thought it was a really stupid comment and i think that I agree with Jacob a hundred percent but it was really just a cry for attention but I think given sort of the controversy around on to the Google memo that aside it was just a very it was very poorly sort of associated with what he had in the past right so he's already got the microscope on him and this was just I think a very very stupid move personally if I were like if I were in charge of his PR I would just be like I don't know what you're doing especially for those of us who defend it it's completely innocuous memo now a guy goes out and he - probably just to get attention is making comments that could be interpreted as agile Ettore at the KKK yeah credibility right and so now people are gonna go look at that memo and say wait a minute he might be a bigot you know he might have these views that are you know not combative compatible as a free society so you know I think he undoes a lot of the unfortunately he undoes some of the credit he gained from the past of writing that very well-thought-out memo and meanwhile you have actual bigots and and people like Democrat Valerie Plame who just today tweeted out an anti-jewish tweet it clearly anti-semitic tweet on Rosh Hashanah on on Kush yeah that's right on Rosh Hashanah dude but people are talking about James - more much more than that they're saying when the Klan hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's dumb or a good job Twitter whoever came up with it but do you we should talk about that a little bit Valerie Plame of course was the Democrat contrivance that was a non traversée non scandal during the Bush administration Arielle do you have any reaction to it I did I had a few reactions but I'll try I'll try to keep it short you know I thought it was interesting is that she's been a contributor on various major news networks like CNN I believe and others and many have pointed this out though that you know they're all worried about having Sean Spicer be a contributor never mind that this woman put it posted a clearly into sematic article suggesting that Jews should announce on television before they give any opinion or foreign policy expertise they should announce that they're Jews just so this is the content of the article okay but we all know how that's worked out the pastor Jews are forced to wear badges or yeah I haven't finished the book I'm reading a book about it now but I hope it turns out all right yeah no I mean it was remarkable and the best part about it was her defense was I'm not anti-semitic but you have to admit that there are many war hawks neo-cons who are Jews I'm thinking okay then she goes on to explain further and she says oh you know I didn't read the article thoroughly enough and I wasn't sure of this platform please woman you have literally sight tweeted articles from this website and from this exact author many times in the past so pleading ignorance do not fall for it she is you know and she's also been an anti-israel activist from like as long as I can remember she was part of the plowshares echo chamber of Ben Rhodes and pushing the Iran deal so you know I tweeted this on Twitter earlier today but you know and nothing makes the Iran deal sweeter than a little anti-semitism right she basically said what Mel Gibson got in trouble for saying a drunken Mel Gibson slurring his words and saying all sorts of crazy things said Jews started all the wars in the world and then this woman completely soberly said the same thing and I bet that she won't be kicked out of Hollywood for a decade oh no she doubled down on it and then kidding me this woman is she's pleading ignorance and do not fall for it she is lying she knows exactly what she tweeted and she tried to defend it so and it's not just her Chelsea Handler just a couple of days ago said on her Netflix show she said that Stacey Stacey - Sheriff David Clarke and Ben Carson are black white supremacist where's the outrage where's the outrage machine I mean this is clearly a a very racist statement that that she made and there's radio-silent stacey dash called her out on it on her new article for young cons but outside of that silence so would you also identify as a black white supremacist well I'm gonna have to say no on to to Chelsea Handler self um only a white supremist supremacist would assume how if this I would assume they have the authority to tell a black person what their disposition is supposed to be that's the irony irony in the form of what they're saying the very form throws back their assertion onto themselves absolutely right all right Ariel Jacob thank you for being here so man so good to have you in thank you so much we now unfortunately have to kick out the whole panel to talk about the mailbag so now we have the first mailbag question from Joe hey sir Knowles just wondering about some relationship advice I'm a constitutional conservative my girlfriend is left-wing in between Bernie and marks what do I do to quote Don Corleone II you're gonna act like a man what's the matter with you that you listen I've I've pretty much exclusively dated Democrats in my life cuz I'm from New York and went to a liberal college and I live in LA you know listen man the conservative view of the world is the more correct view of the world much more so than some socialist like Bernie Sanders or Karl Marx I'm not sure who's further left so just hang around there act like a normal person explain some things to her like some very basic economic and political principles and historical examples and she'll come along she's a semi even close to reasonable person you'll bring her right along not a big deal from Bryan dear Michael master of trolls Knowles as an avid reader of Milton Friedman and Thomas Sol on free-market economics I often find myself in a position to defend this point of view against these postmodern neo-marxists saying that Marxism is the greatest economic philosophy of all time then when I plead against Marxism cases like The Gulag Archipelago the gulag in the Soviet Union and even our examples about socialism doesn't work like Venezuela they always reply that's not real sysm how can you combat this argument this argument that but that's not real Marxism you hear it all the time you say look all of these terrible things have happened because of communism everywhere communist has been tried it's destroyed lives it's robbed more misery than anything else in modernity but they say that isn't real Marxism this is an informal logical fallacy called the no true Scotsman argument and the no true Scotsman argument goes like this no Scotsman would ever have sugar in his in his porridge you say well my uncle is a Scotsman and has sugar in his porridge he says well no true Scotsman would do it so you basically you move the goal posts you change the classification to you change your premise to suit your conclusion so it isn't it isn't logically valid and and obviously in other historical contexts they wouldn't make this same distinction well that isn't true capitalism well that isn't true Americanism so just throw it back in their face that's total bunk from Gary Michael I just wanted you to know that after watching your episode with Joe Villa and Chaya Jones I upgraded my monthly subscription to annual something I was considering for a while but your show brought the decision home no question just an acknowledgement thank you very much I appreciate it and you lucky duck you're gonna get that leftist here's tumblr that's great thank you I appreciate the kind words from John Deere all mighty troll King Knowles as someone who has written a book with no words do you have a favorite word or phrase is there a word or phrase you find amusing to say use a lot in conversation or that has special meaning to you if not is there a phrase or quote that you live by Churchill gave a line about this he said it's good for an uneducated man to read books of quotations and I read that quote and then I read a bunch of books of quotations I do love reading quotes and pull out so all off top of my head there are two there are two that I live by one is from Alexander Pope in his essay on man he says all nature is but art unknown to thee all chance Direction which thou canst not see I love that quoting it's really beautiful and explains a semiotic view of the world and coincidences and then of course the word that I live by if every second of the day is coffe fe co5 a CoV f e fe co frente next question from Monica dear Michael god help us Knowles why is it the English hate us but seem obsessively interested in us best Monica why did the English hate us but seem so interested in us it's because the instead of the Queen's English they would be speaking the Fuehrer's German if it weren't for us they hate us because they ain't us from Patrick how has the price of a lap dance managed to defy economics and inflation over the past decade I am going to ignore the obvious pun between lap dance and inflation and move right on to the question that that is interesting i guess i if the life cost of lap dances haven't increased it probably probably the answer is internet pornography right there one presumes there's the same supply of strippers and therefore lap dances that there ever was it's probably keeping up with population growth but the demand is probably much lower now because 20 years ago or 30 years ago if you wanted to engage in some just debaucherous carousing and lust you would have to go to your local dive and pay a lady to dance on you but now you can just close the blinds and from the comfort of your own room engage in I think a ten billion dollar industry which is internet pornography so sad for the dancers and probably probably sad for our culture too because porn industry is growing immensely from Derrick how would America be different if the founding fathers had not been Christian it's it's an impossible hypothetical because it Christianity it's impossible in the situation because of the development of America but also in the development of the West the only way that that would have happened is if we hadn't turned away the Muslim invaders at Lepanto or tours and and the West had developed entirely differently so one can't really imagine but it is worth considering the providential founding of the country I am despite my Sicilian complexion part of my family is English I think four of my ancestors came over on the Mayflower signed the Mayflower complex and so I've read a lot about the Mayflower and you know there they were headed over toward New York they were headed over toward Manhattan they get blown off course by hundreds of miles but they don't even go up to the next-best Harbor up in Boston Harbor they end up in this little strange place called Plymouth and then out of the woods immediately emerge the only two people in the hemisphere who speak English Squanto and Samoset and they find these perfectly tilled fields ready for agriculture they find stores of corn but they don't find a lot of people because a plague had wiped them all out three years earlier all of the there are some cases where Occam's razor would say the the more likely so answer is Providence rather than some random chance and so there's been this Christian character of the nation since then John Winthrop obviously gave the famous speech a city upon a hill a model of Christian charity and the founding fathers were deeply religious some were deistic some were more traditionally Christian and they said that this Constitution is only fit for a moral and religious people so I have no idea what the country would look like it wouldn't be the country would be a other Li different it would be a totally alternate universe next question from Rachel hello Michael I am enjoying your show so far thank you and I think it's a great addition to the daily wire thank you again seeing as guns trigger leftist so much pun not intended yeah right I'd like to know do you own a firearm and if you could have the firearm of your choice what would it be this would be ignoring your state's laws for example if it is not legal to have an ar-15 thanks Rachel funny you bring up the ar-15 and the gun control laws I did not have a gun I didn't own a gun I didn't especially cater it's fun to go shoot clay pigeons or something but I could rent or borrow some friends but then California passed gun pocalypse and they were going to ban the ar-15 they said in three months the ar-15 is going to be banned so I thought well if I ever won an ar-15 I have to buy it right now what did I do I immediately went out with a number of the daily wired people god-king Jeremy boring and the production King Jonathan hey and went down and when ar-15 shopping so I do sometimes wonder if the Democrats own huge stock in these gun companies because we're so reactive to it the minute they try to ban something it's the best thing that could possibly happen for sales so yeah I do have an ar-15 it's not even my favorite gun I prefer shooting shotguns and clay pigeons and stuff Marshall and I went shooting a little while ago but keep banning a man and we're just gonna keep buying them next question from Brandon dear mister the only goodness in the world thank you as a young lad getting more and more into politics have a question what are different subjects to look into when getting into politics economics government crap and all that other stuff his words not mine thanks Brendon yeah you should look at all that crap Brendon you should look at obviously history economics political philosophy all of that but you should ground all of your political thinking in in the foundational texts of the West so you should ground it all in Plato Aristotle you should read a lot of the classics you should read them the modern classics like Machiavelli's discourses on Livy and the prince and then as far as I'm concerned for even more modern political texts you ought to read Edmund Burke's reflections on the revolution in France and all of his other writing as well Russell Kirk is good to read everything Bill Buckley wrote conscience of a conservative all of that stuff but I would grant as a conservative of a grander political learning in the classics and in history because you'll figure out what has worked over time and you will avoid what the left does the left compares every single news cycle anything that possibly happens to the Third Reich or the fall of Rome and it's because those are the only two things they know about they're the only two things they've ever studied so you should study more and then you'll have more historical knowledge to pull upon from David question the Dennis Rodman's solution that's the title we send him in with a firearm that breaks down into facial piercings get him close assemble the firearm and become an international hero overnight how do you see this plan working out excuse me I'm sorry just one second tango jump shot tango jump shot there on to us they're onto us I'll have to think about it I don't have an answer on that from James dear king of trolls as a history alumnus of Yale could you please help me with my history essay about how enlightenment values influenced the American Revolution if you answer this I'll be able to cite the Michael Noel's show in my bibliography you should also cite reasons to vote for Democrats that has an extensive bibliography that might aid you the real answer is it would be easier to write about how Enlightenment values did not influence the American Revolution all of the American revolutionaries all of the ones that we saw write the Federalist Papers and craft our Constitution in the declaration war Enlightenment thinkers themselves American Enlightenment thinkers so in the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson is channeling john locke and the natural rights to life liberty and property or the pursuit of happiness you see Benjamin Franklin visited Europe a lot of times was engaged in these debates that that come out of the Enlightenment he brought those ideas back to Philadelphia and and obviously the Federalist Papers and the Constitution Express this as well not not simply the Declaration of Independence so that the real answer is everything it would be far easier to point even the writings of Thomas Paine that come later and thankfully only affected it a little bit and not entirely because he was quite radical it would be much easier to point to aspects of the Enlightenment that that did not influence the American Revolution than how they were influential on the revolution final question this is the last one from Theresa hey mister Hilary is my distant cousin Knowles you make me relive that trauma now I need a moment what is your favorite musical and/or Broadway show my favorite musical my favorite Broadway show is the first one that I ever performed in is a little eight-year-old boy and it is unsurprisingly Guys and Dolls what's not to like you get cool guys like Sky Masterson and Nathan played by Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra in the movie you get all those cute chickadees it's a it's a show about men and women I enjoy women it's a show about gambling sometimes I like gambling it's a show about Christianity I really like Christianity it's got it all it's set in New York it's said it a great time I think it's a masterfully done show that really sums up that era of American Broadway musicals alright that's it we got to get out of here thank you for watching tune back on Monday happy Rosh Hashanah to those who celebrate I'm definitely celebrating because I am NOT going to have to be in this office tomorrow so we'll see you then I'm Michael
