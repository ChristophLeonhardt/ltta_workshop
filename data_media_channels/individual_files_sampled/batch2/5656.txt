listen here's my recommendation grab your family grab your friends go to be neighbors get to the pole because if not you didn't have another - or another six years of this craziness so make sure you vote president Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen explaining to CNN on Friday his recent tweet calling on his fellow Americans to get out and vote calling the midterms the most important vote in her lifetime his plea comes after Cohen changed his voter registration from Republican to Democrat Florida's state ride races have been neck and neck but a new round of polling this weekend shows a bit of a tilt toward Democrats the CNN SSRS poll has Democratic Senator Bill Nelson with a five point lead of a Republican Governor Rick Scott fifty percent to forty five percent among likely voters then in the governor's race Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gilliam is ahead by 12 points over Republican Ron disentis fifty-four percent to 42 percent in last night's debate both men were asked about president Trump's influence on kids after that dissent after that De Santis campaign ad that showed him playing build the wall with his daughter and reading a trump book to his son do you think President Trump is a good role model for the children of Florida well Jake we my wife and I were poking a little fun at ourselves because of the way that campaign was going and I'm proud of my family though we I don't actually read the art of the deal to my son Mason he said he's a great kid he smiles in anything but that's not necessarily his cup of tea so here's what I know you know I was very passionate about moving our American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem Donald Trump promised it and he followed through with it and so to me when you give your word and you follow through with it as an elected official that is the model that we're supposed to do he was right to move the embassy to Jerusalem I was there for a historic event I know Andrew didn't support that and doesn't think that's right but to me that was true leadership mr. maryk used by the question the question was whether or not whether or not he thinks President Trump is a good role model for the children of Florida that's what I thought originally I got confused so no he's not Donald Trump is Donald Trump is weak and he performs as all weak people do they become bullies yeah well I tell you what that was that was quite a debate last night the closing remark was something Mike Barnicle something else happened that was fascinating during that debate after Parkland after the massive school shootings that have been going on Andrew Gilliam actually went after the NRA for not negotiating not compromising not doing the most basic things for gun safety and the Republican candidate stood mute who said nothing that is certainly one way politics are changing but I don't know if you saw much of that debate last night but if mayor Gilliam is 12 was 12 points ahead before that debate the interesting to see how high those numbers go after the debate because that one wasn't even close yeah Kristin and let me ask you on that point Andrew Gilliam and I'm trying not to be partisan here but he was a very it was a very impressive performance last night but Andrew Gilliam and it was a very standard political and cautious performance I would think by the Republican candidate for governor mr. DeSantis did you see the debate unfortunately I did not okay so let's look at the numbers this sudden jump to 12 points what impact do you think just on the clips that we saw and the general tenor of campaigns and the contrast between the new candidates what's your estimate where the number is going to go well one I think there's it's interesting that there's such a big difference between the way the governor's race in the Senate race is playing out in that state so you've had current Governor Rick Scott who's been a vocal supporter of President Trump along the way performing much more strongly than the gubernatorial candidate who as you saw ran that ad sort of saying like I am Trump light because I think governor Scott has one his record is governor to run on there where four run DeSantis I think he's mostly known in the state of Florida as someone who has a very strong presence on Fox News but is struggling to make that pivot away from the guy he needed to be to win the Republican primary to the guy he needs to be to win in a state that means slightly red but but is ultimately a swing state whereas I think somebody like Rick Scott already has more of an established identity which is how he's able to perform much more strongly in this environment and distance himself from the president yeah so sequin hockey Florida Florida Florida as Tim Russert would say it remains the bellwether but with you know when it looked like Donald Trump is going to pull ahead and stay ahead in Florida suddenly you knew that other states were going to fall but simply in these two races is that let's take the Senate race first it's been sort of it's been a race run in three parts right after the primary Gilliam was ahead in just about every poll and ahead comfortably I was surprised but he was ahead by three four or five points the Cavanagh hearings flattened that out suddenly it became close but here we are moving beyond the Cavanaugh debates and and suddenly you have Gilliam up comfortably and now you have bill Nelson for the first time up by what was it five points in this poll still could be an outlier but at the same time you have both Democratic candidates breaking pretty hard with two weeks to go yeah and I I do want to see some more here just in terms of the outlier potential but I would say overall you're right I mean since the primary it's been very consistent Gilliam has consistently led the governor's race this is the largest margin I've seen him have a lead by but he's consistently been ahead there the question that that's raised to me is is there going to be in effect there were Gilliam ends up helping Nelson survive because Scott as Christian says has been running so much closer in that race and the other variable I think you have to mention here is the fallout from the hurricane so you've now had two polls taken in Florida since the hurricane and what they've shown is there's there's very broad I think not surprising here there's very broad support for how Governor Scott handled the hurricane down there now one of those poles actually put him ahead of Nelson by 2 points this poll shows him behind Nelson by 5 points both of those polls show Gilliam leading in the governor's race so again it's a question here if it has this thing broken open in a new way we're Gilliam is not just a head but is a head decisively and as a head at such a level that he can pull Nelson over the top or is it a bit of an outlier and maybe that Senate race is more in play but I think yeah and the governor's race I think it's pretty clear there's an advantage to kill him right here boy it certainly does look John Heilemann like we're gonna be following two tracks all the way to Election Day the Nelson race is going to be tight the Senate race is going to be tight all the way to the end but Gilliam does look right now like he has a little bit of space between himself and DeSantis and he's back to where he was before the Cavanaugh hearings looking pretty good against a guy who as Kristen said ran a scorched earth campaign a Donald Trump campaign to get to win the primary may maybe that works in Idaho probably doesn't work in the state of Florida yeah I mean look yeah I think if you look at that Senate race that is sort of a race that reflects the state of Florida if you look at the governor's race right now what you're seeing I think is just one of these races where the difference between candidate quality is the whole story you have a candidate again as Mike said not it's not saying this in a partisan way but if you just watch that debate last night and you watch their performance over the worst of the last three or four months Gilliam is up as a very powerful presence on the stump he's a very he's got a very charismatic cannon he's very good at what he's doing his performance skills are very very high do Stannis's or not and so in that in this moment there's a lot of energy around the new face i'll forgetting for a lot of Floridians even but you know you go downstate in Florida get down to the south part of Florida yeah Andrew Gilliam is a fresh face in Florida even though he's been mayor for a while up in Tallahassee so people are just meeting him and I think he is he's electrifying the Democratic base and there are a lot of people in Florida or seeing this guy and the disparity between the two candidates in terms of what people are seeing on television every day is very very wide and I think that's starting to settle in down all right uh no morning Joe is going to be live in Florida Florida Florida Lorna this Friday we're heading to tacos John Heilemann favorite place I'm sure in Florida Rocco's tacos and tequila bar that's just for you Johnny gets in but got two favorite things on earth exactly if you're in Boca Raton come by stop be part of the show in confidence again I mean these two races that we've been talking about are going to be two of the most exciting races in America for tickets and information click on Joe dot msnbc.com and as we always say going to break as we as we go to break we mentioned Andrew gillum's closing argument last night just 15 days until voters go to the polls this was his closing argument because my mother and father would have to get up so early in the morning to go to work they would load us all into a car drive us over to my grandmother's house where she would have a ritual and do two things before she'd let us cross the threshold of the door she take her bottle of olive oil also known as blessing oil and build a cross on my forehead as a way to send us out into the day with a blessing and a covering and then she would have this mantra what she'd say go to school mind your teachers get your lesson and one day bring that education home she say bring it home for your mama for your daddy who get out there and work on somebody else's job bring it home for your little brother and your little sister what my grandmother was communicating to me was that it wasn't just about me it's about all of us and in Trump's America we've been led to believe that we've got to step on our neighbors shoulder in their face and their backs in order to get ahead well I reject that and we have an opportunity on November 6 as a collective as a state to say we deserve better we want better we want better schools access to health care a clean economy a restorative justice system networks where hand in glove the community and law enforcement work together for all of our benefit I'm asking you all for the only thing in life that my mother ever told me to ask for and that's a chance thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can collect
