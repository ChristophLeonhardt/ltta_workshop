RIGHT NOW IN SYRIA, WE ARE IN THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENT ON THE PLANET FROM OUR ADVERSARIES WERE TESTING US EVERY DAY, KNOCKING DOWN OUR COMMUNICATIONS. Martha: THAT IS ALARMING AND THAT CAME FROM THE HEAD OF U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS SAYING ELECTRONIC WHILE WARFARE IS NOW ONE OF THE MILITARY'S BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN SYRIA. OUR ENEMIES ARE ABLE TO DISABLE AMERICAN PLANES THAT ARE PROVIDING AIR SUPPORT TO U.S. COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND HERE THAT IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION. THEY ARE JAMMING THE U.S. DRONES IN THE REGION. JOHNNY MONELL, REBECCA GRAHAM REBECCA, WELCOME BACK. THAT'S DISTURBING TO READ LET'S PUT UP THE PICTURE AGAIN OF THE AC 1:30. THEY ARE ABLE TO JAM THE AC 130. WHAT ARE THESE DOING QUESTION MIKE WHAT ARE THEY FOR US? IT'S A HIGHLY CAPABLE GUNSHIP, BUT IT PROVIDES GUNFIRE. THE RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO INTERFERE WITH THE HF AND UHF RADIO FREQUENCIES. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE BEING AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE, BUT THIS IS ALL PUTIN. THEY HAVE BROUGHT ALL OF THAT TO SYRIA TO TEST OUT OUR U.S.-LED COALITION AND OUR PARTNERS. Martha: HOW DO WE FIGHT BACK AGAINST THAT? FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS NOT GOING TO STOP THE ANTI-ISIS PUBLIC OPERATIONS. WHAT WHAT WE NEED HERE, THEY'VE GOT SOME WONDERFUL RADIOS. WHAT WE HAVE IS THE ABILITY TO REBUILD AND REFORM THESE NETWORKS BECAUSE THE COALITION CONNECTS WITH RADIOS AND DIFFERENT DEVICES. WITH A NEED TO DO IS ACCELERATE THE FUELING. THE STRATEGY CALLS FOR US TO COUNTER THIS. Martha: THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT IN SYRIA. WATCH. WE HAVE FINISHED THE FIGHT. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE NOT WITHDRAWING. YOU'LL SEE IT'S A REENERGIZED EFFORT. THIS IS AN ONGOING FIGHT RIGHT NOW. IT'S A RISKY PROPOSITION. I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY REGRET IT. Martha: WHAT DO YOU MAKE THAT? WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE GROUND HELPING OUR PARTNERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER. THAT IS 100% RIGHT. WE NEED TO HAVE MORE STABILIZATION SO THEY CAN GO ON THERE. THAT'S WHY THE RUSSIAN ACTIVITY IS SO DANGEROUS, BUT MAKE NO
