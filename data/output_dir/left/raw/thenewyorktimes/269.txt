1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,110
Saudi Arabia is
conquering Iran.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,810
At least it is in this computer
generated animation

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,200
showing the kingdom's 
young crown prince

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,720
Mohammed bin Salman,
known as M.B.S.,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,863
leading his forces
to an easy victory.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,250
A Cold War between
Saudi Arabia and Iran

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,960
is already roiling
the Middle East,

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,980
fueling the fighting
in Yemen and Syria

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,890
and tensions in Iraq,
Lebanon, and beyond.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,640
But this video takes
that confrontation

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,210
to a comical new height—
a fantasy invasion.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,600
Until the recent rise of M.B.S,
this kind of propaganda

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,240
was almost unheard of
in the staid kingdom.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,100
Some scholars say
the video may even

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,150
offer a window into the hawkish
mindset of M.B.S. himself,

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,594
foreshadowing more
conflict across the region.

17
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:51,510
An official of the Saudi
embassy in Washington

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,800
said the prince had nothing
to do with the video.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,410
It appeared in
December on YouTube,

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,470
social media, and the websites 
of Saudi newspapers.

21
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,020
But if M.B.S. did not
authorize it,

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,650
the cartoon must at least 
have won his approval.

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,030
The anonymous
makers of the video

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,610
had significant resources.
They simultaneously

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,570
released the video
in several languages,

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,180
including Turkish
Mandarin and Hebrew.

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,140
They received instant promotion
in news media controlled

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,910
by the royal court,
and they knew

29
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,290
the visual details of
Iranian naval vessels,

30
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,120
as well as the vast
Saudi arsenal.

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,180
The animation shows off 
billions of dollars worth

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,800
of American, British, 
and Chinese made weapons.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,120
It is a fearsome
display of hardware,

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,100
but also underscores
the Western role

35
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,820
in backing M.B.S. 
and the Saudis.

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,700
The video begins with 
a vow from the prince:

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,150
We will not wait until the
fight is in Saudi Arabia,

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,670
we will bring the fight to Iran.

39
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,760
We then see a Saudi aid
ship in the Persian Gulf,

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,810
notably labeled here 
as the Arabian Gulf.

41
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,540
In January, shortly after this
animation appeared,

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,610
Saudi Arabia announced
that its coalition would

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,780
give $1.5 billion 
in new aid to Yemen.

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,360
The kingdom has led an air 
and sea assault for almost

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,249
three years to try to defeat a
Yemeni group allied with Iran.

46
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,670
The war has left thousands
of Yemeni civilians

47
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,988
dead and the country engulfed
by famine and disease.

48
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,970
The Iranian ships that
appear next are realistic.

49
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,100
Years of sanctions
and isolation have

50
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,700
left most of Iran’s military
out of date and poorly equipped.

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,410
But it has built up a fleet of
small, fast boats like these.

52
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,330
Last spring the White
House brokered a deal

53
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,460
for Saudi Arabia
to pay $6 billion

54
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,310
to the American company 
Lockheed Martin for four warships.

55
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,030
It was part of a total package
of arms deals with $10 billion.

56
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,540
Sir, sir! We have detected
incoming missiles.

57
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,780
Prepare the Patriots.

58
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,390
Saudi Arabia also has 
hundreds of Patriot missiles

59
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,030
from the American company
Raytheon like those seen here.

60
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,040
The kingdom is the
biggest foreign customer

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,430
for Typhoon jets from
the British company B.A.E.

62
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,850
And it also owns several
dozen British-made Tornadoes,

63
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,165
as seen here.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,440
Boeing’s F15 fighter
jet is the bedrock

65
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,830
of the Saudi Arabian and
American military partnership.

66
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,870
President Obama approved
a deal for the kingdom

67
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,240
to spend billions
buying the jets.

68
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,890
It was the most
expensive weapons deal

69
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,110
to any foreign country
at the time, an effort

70
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,940
to placate the
kingdom's opposition

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,280
to the Iranian
nuclear agreement.

72
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,980
Get me the Eastern Winds.

73
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,670
The kingdom also recently 
acknowledged that it has acquired

74
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,440
Chinese-made 
Eastern Winds missiles,

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,520
which could carry 
a nuclear warhead.

76
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,010
We then see Saudi missiles
destroy Iran’s Bushehr

77
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,430
civilian nuclear power plant.

78
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,620
This leads to 
a ground invasion.

79
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,080
In 2016 Saudi Arabia paid 
the American company

80
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,600
General Dynamics
$1.2 billion

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,630
for more than 
100 Abrams tanks.

82
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,550
But the kingdom doesn’t
have transport boats

83
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,940
to get the tanks 
to Iran.

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,450
The cowering figure 
near the end

85
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,560
is Major General 
Qassim Suleimani,

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,100
commander of Iran's
paramilitary Quds Force.

87
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,880
He's known as the chess master
moving Iranian proxy forces

88
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,710
throughout the region.

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,680
At the end, cartoon Iranians
cheer their Saudi liberators.

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,480
But flesh and blood Iranians
are unlikely to welcome

91
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,529
Saudi armed forces.

92
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,640
Perhaps most notably, 
the crowd appears to cheer

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,870
for the prince, M.B.S., 
as much as for his father,

94
00:04:23,870 --> 00:00:00,000
King Salman.
