THE CHOLERA
OUTBREAK IN YEMEN WE REPORTED ON
EARLIER THIS YEAR IS NOW BEING
CALLED THE LARGEST EVER RECORDED
IN ANY COUNTRY IN A SINGLE YEAR,
WHICH IS NOT THE WAY DISEASES
ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK IN THE
MODERN ERA.
THERE ARE NOW 5000
NEW CASES JUST WITHIN YEMEN
EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND SO FAR THE
DEATH TOLL IS ALREADY OVER 1000,
A QUARTER OF WHICH IS CHILDREN.
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A CIVIL WAR
GOING ON THERE, AND BECAUSE OF
THAT YEMEN'S INFRASTRUCTURE, IN
ALL SENSES BUT MEDICALLY AS
WELL, HAS BEEN LARGELY
DESTROYED, MOSTLY DUE TO THE
U.S.-BACKED SAUDI AIRSTRIKES.
IT'S BELIEVED THAT IT WILL GET
WORSE ONCE YEMEN ENTERS ITS
RAINY SEASON LATER ON THIS YEAR,
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY TRAGIC NEWS AND
ONLY GETTING WORSE.
BACK HERE IN
AMERICA WE HAD MADE IN AMERICA
WEEK, WE HAVE A LITTLE IRONY FOR
YOU.
NOT ONLY DURING THAT WEEK
DID TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY
CONTINUE TO PRODUCE THEIR
PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF AMERICA, BUT
MAR-A-LAGO APPLIED FOR 70 NEW
FOREIGN WORKER VISAS.
GRANTED
THEY WILL BE MAKING BIG,
BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN CAKES, BUT
THEY WILL BE FOREIGNERS.
YOU CAN'T FIND AMERICANS TO DO
THOSE JOBS.
THAT IS SKILLED,
TECHNICAL WORK YOU CAN ONLY FIND
A BROAD.
THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT
IRONY MADE IN AMERICA WEEK.
I'M DUMBFOUNDED, I THINK IT'S
A FAILURE OF POLITICS BECAUSE
I'LL THINK I MET MY CORE WRONG,
AT ITS CORE THERE WAS AN
EFFECTIVE ANTI-TRUMP STRATEGY
ABOUT MAKING ALL OF HIS PRODUCTS
ABROAD.
AND IT FAILED, IT WAS
NEVER ATTEMPTED CORRECTLY, IT
WAS NOT STUCK TO.
IT WAS LATE-NIGHT HOSTS THAT
DID MOST OF IT.
MAYBE THE GUY WAS IMPERVIOUS
TO ANY DENT IN THE ARMOR --
THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT
WAS THE CASE -- BUT I STILL FELT
LIKE THIS WAS A BASE LEVEL --
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT
AMERICANS WERE LIKE, YOU'RE
KIDDING ME, YOU DON'T MAKE YOUR
STUFF HERE.
WE WENT AFTER THE
WRONG THINGS.
THE HYPOCRISY OF TRUMP IS ON
DISPLAY IN A LOT OF WAYS, BUT
IT'S RIGHT THERE ON EVERY TAG IN
A WAY THAT'S DEMONSTRABLE.
BUT I
THINK IN A WAY HE WAS
BULLETPROOF.
AND DURING THE
CAMPAIGN, I KNOW WE ALWAYS REFER
TO THE CAMPAIGN A LOT, BUT IT
WAS SORT OF AN IMPORTANT
CAMPAIGN -- HILLARY WAS ANYTHING
BUT BULLETPROOF.
I HEARD SHE PRODUCED MOST OF
HER TRUMP PRODUCTS OVERSEAS.
I
DON'T THINK SHE GOT ENOUGH
CRITICISM FOR THAT.
THAT'S OF
COURSE WHY WE ARE MENTIONING
THIS.
IN CASE ANY TRUMP VIEWERS
ARE WATCHING THIS, YOU KNOW HE'S
NOT ON YOUR SIDE, RIGHT?
FINALLY
EARLIER THIS WEEK DURING THE
HEALTHCARE FALLOUT FROM IT
FALLING APART AND DONALD TRUMP
WANTING TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK,
HE HAD A MEETING RECALLED ON THE
SENATE TO TAKE AWAY THE RECESS
IN AUGUST AND NOT REST UNTIL
THEY PASSED A HEALTHCARE BILL.
AT THAT TIME BOTH JAYAR JACKSON
AND I PREDICTED THAT THAT WILL
PROBABLY BE A DO AS I SAY NOT AS
I DO THING, AND THERE'S EVIDENCE
THAT IS THE CASE.
THE FAA ISSUED
FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS AROUND THE
TRUMP PROPERTY IN NEW JERSEY FOR
AUGUST 3 TO AUGUST 20, WHICH IT
GENERALLY DOES WHEN DONALD TRUMP
IS OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE
AND STAYING SOMEWHERE ELSE.
IT
LOOKS LIKE HE WILL SPEND ABOUT
THREE WEEKS PLAYING GOLF IN NEW
JERSEY, WHICH IS OF COURSE AS WE
KNOW THE BEST WAY TO PASS
HEALTHCARE BILLS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING TO A NEW
JERSEY GOLF RESORT FOR 17 DAYS
WHEN YOU COULD GO ANYWHERE IN
THE WORLD?
CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING TO A NEW
JERSEY GOLF RESORT FOR 17 DAYS
AND YOUR GOLF GAME BEING STILL
SO BAD THAT YOU NEED TO OPENLY
CHEAT?
I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE IN
THAT CIRCLE, THESE CEOS WHO PLAY
GOLF WITH HIM -- HE IS A
NOTORIOUS CHEATER, EVERYONE
TALKS ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.
WE
WILL HEAR LATER ON IN THE SHOW
ABOUT HOW GOOD AT SPORTS HE IS.
HE'S GREAT AT SPORTS.
