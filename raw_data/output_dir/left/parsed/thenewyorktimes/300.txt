Dear Senator Marco Rubio,
my name is Shana Rosenthal,
and I used to be your intern.
I listened to constituent
calls day in and day out,
and logged their concerns,
which were sent to you.
And now three years later, I’m
one of those concerned citizens
pleading for change from you,
our elected Florida official.
In my short lifetime
of 21 years,
I’ve been within the vicinity
of four mass shootings
where 152 people have
been murdered or injured.
I was a mile up the street from
Pulse Nightclub.
Eight months before that, Florida State
University.
Five people at my local airport, inching
closer and closer to Marjory
Stoneman Douglas my alma mater.
I've realized no one is safe.
I don’t want this
to happen any more.
I think we need to wait to
make sure number one that most
of the laws — and I don’t
want to get into that debate
right now.
There’s people
watching this that
may have someone they
love, then that’s not
what they’re interested
at this moment.
Maybe they are.
It is your job as
our elected official
to protect your constituents.
This isn’t about party politics.
This is about human lives,
lives of my friends,
my family, my community members.
I’m begging you to implement
a systematic plan which
will end mass shootings.
Obviously, there’s a debate in
this country about what our gun
laws should be, and
I’ve always said
if there’s a gun law that
could have prevented this
or any other instance, it’s
something we should definitely
consider doing.
You can begin by
funding research
on gun violence and
gun violence prevention
so we can at least
begin to understand
the underlying crisis at hand.
Implementing stricter
gun licensing,
extensive background
checks, closing loopholes
in gun purchasing at
gun shows, implementing
a buffer period
between gun purchasing
and bringing the weapon home.
I hope you hear this
message free of influence
from wealthy lobbying
powers which impede
your senatorial judgment.
Senator Marco Rubio, I
want you to prove me wrong.
I want you to prove that you’re
not just another wasted seat
and that you truly care
about your constituents.
