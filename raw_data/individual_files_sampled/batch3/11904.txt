potentially the end in sight four months of political deadlock in Germany after days of primitive coalition talks have resulted in a breakthrough covering that Charla Dubinski next the leaders say that they satisfied that they've been able to put together this 28 page blueprint document but we are still a long way away from any potential coalition being formed they also admitted that these were incredibly difficult and intensive talks at time they say that there was deep probing and that there was a need to maintain unity so what's in that blueprint well in the blueprint they've discussed some of the thorny issues between them including tax military refugees and indeed Europe now this blueprint says that the parties have come together to agree that they would look to limit the number of refugees who can come to Germany between a hundred and eighty and two hundred and twenty thousand refugees coming to Germany annually they've also agreed that there would be a cap on the number of family members that those refugees could be able to bring to Germany that would be capped at around a thousand people per month and on Europe they say that they have agreed in this blueprint that they want to strengthen Europe financially saying that they will give more money to the EU saying that that's the only way that it can better fulfill its tasks but this agreement is just the beginning of yet a long road to go the Social Democrats will need to take this agreement and present it to their party and their party will then vote on whether this agreement is something that they want to use as a basis for formal coalition talks that vote won't take place until January 21st there's also a question as to whether the German public have the appetite for yet another grand coalition a recent poll by one of the German public broadcasters actually found that 52 percent of Germans didn't want to see another grand coalition what we do know is while Angela Merkel who's been under so much pressure to form a coalition since those elections more than three months ago is still not out of the woods she we'll be breathing a sigh of relief that it looks that she is at least another step closer to forming a new government
