1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,940
Singapore is truly an international city.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,540
There are four official languages but you'll
hear dozens more

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,000
on the streets of this island city-state

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,119
Half the population is temporary, stopping
in to work or study for short stints

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,640
And that constant coming-and-going creates a vibrant
mix of cultures.

6
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,760
Tucked under Malaysia, Singapore was only
founded in 1965

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,840
It's now one of the richest nations in the
world and a global financial hub.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,739
Singapore invested a whopping $1 billion in
startups and 37 thousand international companies

9
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:55,720
are based here

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,400
The first thing you need to know about Singapore is it's
not all work.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,080
The city now claims six of the world's
best bars, plus 47 Michelin stars.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,399
So let’s start here - at the swanky Atlas
bar

13
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:20,080
Front and centre is the colossal gin-tower,
packed with over 1000 varieties.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,880
This art-deco bar opened last year and was
quickly rated in the world's top 20

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,840
But if you’re looking for something a little
less shouty, head over to D.Bespoke

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,640
The Ginza-style bar is regularly rated one
of the best cocktail spots in the city

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,400
it’s sleek and sumptuous interior draws
in a sharply dressed crowd

18
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,880
But you don’t have to spend a fortune to
enjoy the breadth of what Singapore has to

19
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:56,881
offer

20
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:02,829
The city state has three major ethnic groups
- Chinese, Malay and Indian

21
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:08,008
To have a taste of the more traditional and
colourful side of Singapore, plan a day trip

22
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:14,710
to the cultural enclaves of Chinatown, Little
India or the Arab Quarter

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,960
But if you want to eat where the chef choose
to eat - try this.

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,330
Burnt Ends is not a good option for vegetarians

25
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,250
It specialises in grilled meats and has become
a favourite of local and visiting chefs

26
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,250
Set up by two Australians this modern barbecue
restaurant is famous for its open kitchen

27
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,440
and super-heated coal oven

28
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,760
It's actually illegal to rent out private
homes in Singapore so stick to hotels

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,870
And luckily there's plenty of those

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
We’ve saved, what’s probably singapore’s
most famous hotel and bar for last and that’s

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,270
because you can’t get in there at the moment

32
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:04,320
Raffles Hotel is where the Singapore Sling
was invented and it's reopening in the fall

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,480
of 2018 after a massive rconstruction

34
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,880
finally, if you find yourself with time some
down time go see the audacious Gardens by

35
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,010
the Bay

36
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,200
Populated with giant Super Trees, these structures
are really hanging huge gardens

37
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,120
Total cost of the public park was $1billion
part of a push by Singapore to transform into

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:00:00,000
what they call a City in a Garden.
