♪ ♪ Sean: WITH REACTION IS THE ONGOING KAVANAUGH NOMINATION SAGA, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK CIVIL RIGHTS COALITION, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ACLU, MICHAEL MYERS. YOU SAW THE AD WE PLAYED LAST NIGHT. SINCE 1981 TO 2005, YOU WERE A MEMBER, A HIGH-RANKING MEMBER OF THE ACLU? I WAS ON THE BOARD, I WAS ALSO A VOTING MEMBER MOST OF THOSE YEARS ON THE ACLU EXECUTIVE'S COMMITTEE. Sean: HOW DO YOU FEEL? I WAS PROUDEST OF THE ACLU WHEN THEY RESISTED FASCISM, WHEN THEY STOOD UP TO THE MAMA. NOW THEY HAVE BECOME THE MOM. IT HAS BECOME WHAT THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO STAND UP TO THE MOB, STAND FOR FREEDOM AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, SUPPOSED TO STAND FOR THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. IT DOESN'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. IT MAKES A PRESUMPTION THAT A PERSON IS PRESUMED TO BE INNOCENT UNLESS HE IS PROVEN GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT IN TERMS OF CIVIL MATTERS, THE PERCENT IS INNOCENT UNLESS THERE IS A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. Sean: WHAT HAPPENED, MICHAEL? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ORGANIZATION? THE THE ACLU IS HIJACKEDY THE THE ACLU IS HIJACKEDT THE THE ACLU IS HIJACKEDE LEFT. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH ANYMORE. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE RESISTANCE. AS OPPOSED TO RESISTING FASHION, THEY HAVE BEEN PART OF THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT. I Sean: DO CIVIL LIBERTARIANS COME BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE, OR DO YOU NOW JOIN PEOPLE LIKE ME, WHICH I KNOW WILL GIVE SEND SHOCK WAVES THROUGH YOUR SPINE? LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY. THE ACLU HAS BECOME LIKE THE NAACP. ONCE YOU LOSE CONTROL OF YOUR BOARD, ONCE YOU DO NOT HAVE CIVIL LIBERTARIANS ON THE BOARD, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION ORGANIZATION ANYMORE. AND YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BOTTOM-LINE LUNATICS IN TERMS OF THE LEFT. THEY WANT "JUSTICE" PEERED SO IF A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AC A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AS A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AT A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AO A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AN A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AI A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AS A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AE A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AO A WOMAN ENCOURAGES A MAN, THE AF THE ACLU. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN A PRINCIPAL OF CIVIL LIBERTIES. YOU CAN'T ACCUSE SOMEONE AND PRESUME A PERSON IS GUILTY AS OPPOSED TO INNOCENT. Sean: THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE YOU, ALAN DERSHOWITZ IN THIS
