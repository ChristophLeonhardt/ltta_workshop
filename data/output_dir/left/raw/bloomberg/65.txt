00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,600
The design of this board game started in 1904 with a woman named Elizabeth Magie.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,400
She was a fan of a book called "Progress and Poverty" by economist Henry George.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,250
In it he argued that renting out land only
profited a few individuals at the expense

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,150
of the community.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,120
To teach people about Georgeâ€™s theories,
Lizzie Magie created a game with 2 sets of rules.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,180
In one, players all shared money when someone purchased a piece of land.

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,780
And in the other, everyone tried to get as
rich as possible while bankrupting others.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,940
This way she hoped people would see how unfair land-grabbing was.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,090
The Landlord's Game as it was known, became
popular, particularly among Quakers.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,580
With each person drawing the board by hand on to tablecloths or fabric

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,810
and modifying the rules.

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,190
One of those people was Charles Darrow.

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,792
He would only use the rules which were cutthroat and made a version of the

14
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,380
board in the shape of his dining table.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,670
He also took street names from Atlantic City, grouping them by color and adding small illustrations

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,850
- to create the board we know today.

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,770
When Parker Brothers bought the rights to
Monopoly from Darrow in 1935, they soon added

18
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:18,080
a portly mascot with a top hat and cane, rumoured
to be modelled on wealthy banker J.P. Morgan.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,100
They also distributed every set with metal
tokens, inspired by the trinkets Darrow had

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,369
used from his niece's charm bracelet.

21
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:30,600
Within a year of the release, 35,000 copies of Monopoly were being made each week.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,720
Now more than 1 billion people in 114 countries have played the game.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Classic and familiar, this is the design that
set out to make us work together but has been

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:00:00,000
dividing families ever since.
