00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,540
for a run at the gym like this and yeah

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,740
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> first I need to brush</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my teeth</font>

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,540
because nothing irritates me more than

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,460
brushing my teeth brushing my teeth then

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,180
doing exercise when ah too bright when

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,119
my mouth tastes like a sock and this is

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,130
ready to work out almost when I put my

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,990
shoes on I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> retired from the gym I</font>

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,580
have so sweaty something very tragic

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,170
happened like five seconds into my

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,050
workout in that my<font color="#CCCCCC"> headphones snapped I</font>

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,550
have moved you onto the tripod why I

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,739
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> my oats to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> save my poor triceps</font>

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,110
from the pain of lifting up the 60d so

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,520
december the first which is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me today</font>

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,010
is personally the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first day in which you</font>

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,289
allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start celebrating the</font>

20
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,989
holidays in any way shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> or form i'm so</font>

21
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">glad that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you all acquiesce to my will</font>

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,550
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively especially the inflatable</font>

23
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,930
duck than I thought earlier this week

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,489
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christmas hat on it that's partly</font>

25
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,690
for me because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure of</font>

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,340
Christmas growing up I<font color="#CCCCCC"> grew up in a</font>

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,350
Roman<font color="#E5E5E5"> Catholic household you have the</font>

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,449
first Sunday of Advent first<font color="#E5E5E5"> December as</font>

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,840
when we would go and get our tree and

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,010
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this year like do I</font>

31
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,510
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a treat like a little tree</font>

32
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,000
before I go or is there no point because

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,250
I leave on the 21st I do not like the

34
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,680
sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feeling that having a piece</font>

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,110
of foliage inside adds to your life

36
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,220
especially around Christmas time

37
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,360
especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you live by yourself</font>

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,130
it's quite nice to have we shall see

39
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,380
i'll get some lights but not before the

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,350
thursday which is payday and say yeah I

41
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,060
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know oh no but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for now we eat my</font>

42
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,500
oats because that's just the kind of

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,729
wild party<font color="#CCCCCC"> girl I am</font>

44
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,430
so one thing I always do understand the

45
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,860
first is listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my favorite Christmas</font>

46
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,380
songs my absolute favorite Christmas

47
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,910
song of all time is by the killers and

48
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,280

Christmas song every single year<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,210
last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they do it but their new</font>

53
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,000

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,370
ties up like the Santa trilogy wait it's

55
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,840
too hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rubber boot socks on at the</font>

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,960
same time and sober and they were on

58
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,440
really excited about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I never watch</font>

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,580
late-night television because I'm always

60
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,160
like lying down reading in bed by that

61
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,230
time to other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on I love are</font>

62
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,540
Christmas lights by Coldplay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> white</font>

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,340
three have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tendency to make me cry a</font>

66
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,020
little bit as well my makeup routine is

67
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,330
so basic I use the gorgeous moisturizer

68
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,190
from lush which I'm running out and I

69
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,500
use this liquid powder foundation from

70
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,209
our glass which is cruelty free which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

71
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,370
excellent it's called immaculate amazing

72
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,470
it in shell because I'm putting a shell

73
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,880
around my face but it feels like powder

74
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,650
when it comes on it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's amazing</font>

75
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,840
and then this today I'm using glamorous

76
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,750
another lush lipstick also cruelty-free

77
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,510

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,130
lot of chinese food it was actually a

99
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,550
delicious

100
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,890
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried this place before and it</font>

101

<font color="#CCCCCC">was mmm today was a busy day and he saw</font>

102
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,750
basically none of it but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

103
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,430
a little bit about you doing like Who I

104
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,590
am because I don't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I talk</font>

105
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,930
about myself nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this channel no I</font>

106
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,160
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look a little bit about</font>

107
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,000
that idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of identity especially in the</font>

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,670
context of brands because I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

109
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,530
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a point at which people</font>

110
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,390
started being called brands and people

111
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,610
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed back against it and now</font>

112
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,290
it's completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in its people</font>

113
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,520
are being called Brad's and talking

114
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,140
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their brands in a way that is kind</font>

115
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,270
of joking but<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also not and that's</font>

116
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,800
fine it's just a different approach to

117
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,710
it and but reconciling myself with that

118
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,390
and finding my place within that world

119
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">has been something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've been</font>

120
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's go over</font>

121
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,339
here so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down I thought I like</font>

122
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,780
to write and now I'm realizing that I

123
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,180
actually looks like slightly hilariously

124
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,350
obscenely ridiculously tired so that is

125
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the good thing about vlogmas it is</font>

126
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,270
forcing me to reflect upon myself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

127
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,730
exhaustion and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> received a comment</font>

128
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,110
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Instagram the other day and it's not</font>

129
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I don't know that I</font>

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,580
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> bothered by it it has had me</font>

131
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,890
thinking a lot the comment was basically

132
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,650
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube self and my Instagram self</font>

133
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,419
are two very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different people we</font>

134
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:50,980
construct these identities of ourselves

135
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,800
and we are given in lots of ways

136
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,570
templates from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this life should</font>

137
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,280
look like especially on different

138
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,350
platforms and what success looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

139
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,080
different platforms we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many</font>

140
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,730
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> facets to ourself and our</font>

141
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,230
existence here I tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be quite</font>

142
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,780
serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I tend to I don't know talk</font>

143
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,130
about books a lot and talk about things

144
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,900
from quite an academic perspective and

145
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,240
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

146
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,790
personal perspective on Instagram I tend

147
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,470
to post pictures of myself when I'm

148
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,270
about to running and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I post pictures of</font>

149
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,340
my food and I post pictures of my

150
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,500
friends and I post a lot of pictures

151
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,419
because I'm incredibly snap happy and

152
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,430
always have been it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the broad</font>

153
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,650
range of experiences but it is i think

154
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,900
reflective of a broad range of different

155
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,180
aspects to each person's personality and

156
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,460
using the contrast between the different

157
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">modes of expression is I think a quite</font>

158
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,870
flawed barometer for whether someone is

159
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,810
being genuine on youtube or line in

160
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,220
general whether

161
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,380
faking it whether they're happy whether

162
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,300
they're sad I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

163
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,400
is necessarily a way in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

164
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,290
measure that but I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanting to</font>

165
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,580
measure that because we have been

166
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">brought up with advertising thrown at us</font>

167
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,060
in every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single direction and we have</font>

168
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,890
had to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an approach to it we've had</font>

169
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,350
to develop ways to spot when someone is

170
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,570
being inauthentic when someone is trying

171
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,190
to sell you something with someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

172
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,350
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell you a lifestyle that is</font>

173
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,630
not necessarily commensurate with their

174
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,670
own ideals let alone yours so completely

175
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,110
understand that approach because I do it

176
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,420
too and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't even had to become a</font>

177
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,960
teenager<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this era of like monetize</font>

178
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,210
YouTube I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changed a</font>

179
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,910
lot and monetized output and creative

180
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,880
output that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed a great deal my</font>

181
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,770
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> with advertising was quite</font>

182
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy to other it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was quite easy to put</font>

183
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,940
in a book over there even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I saw</font>

184
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,919
like Britney<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spears and sketches it was</font>

185
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,990
over there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to put a</font>

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">distance because I saw it as an advert</font>

187
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recognized it as an adverb but it</font>

188
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,150
was still giving me<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and what</font>

189
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,040
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been thinking about a lot is how</font>

190
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,100
when we become the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advert and lots of</font>

191
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,840
ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it isn't separated and you</font>

192
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,370
don't have that delineation and you

193
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,010
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> often especially outside of the UK</font>

194
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,230
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't often tell what's an</font>

195
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,450
advert and what's not how does that

196
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">affect our ability to actually see</font>

197
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,330
clears moments of genuine connection

198
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,070
because are we always because are we

199
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,080
always looking for the trick are we

200
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,490
always looking for the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which</font>

201
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,710
we're being deceived and how much is

202
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,300
that different as well like how much is

203
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,770
that something that's new or is it just

204
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,450
something that's scaled in a different

205
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,160
way we have access to more people now we

206
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,600
have access to more people's expressions

207
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,820
like how how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that how does that</font>

208
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,080
change us how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that change your</font>

209
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,850
identity these aren't rhetorical

210
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,410
questions I really want to hear your

211
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,880
hooks in it because it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

212
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,160
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been a bit fixated on</font>

213
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,990
especially over the last few days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

214
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,370
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for consistency are we</font>

215
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,620
looking for flat are we looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

216
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is reliable is that what</font>

217
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,900
we're seeking because that could make

218
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,270
sense as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know from what</font>

219
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,620
perspective but it could make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense that</font>

220
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for something like steady</font>

221
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,650
and reliable and you know what to expect

222
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">but I don't know it was a fascinating</font>

223
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,260
comment for me because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just</font>

224
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,400
it did make me think a great deal about

225
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,800
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm presenting myself which is not</font>

226
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,570
actually something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of maybe</font>

227
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,670
as often as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might think</font>

228
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,460
especially not in the context of like

229
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,870
branding or anything like that in

230
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,030
addition to going to therapy this is

231
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,460
therapy this is a mode of expression

232
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,140
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do and</font>

233
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,730
I need to feel like I'm making something

234
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,710
whether that's through this land whether

235
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> writing with us through my work</font>

236
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,670
whether that's what ever thats through

237
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,440
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that say about identity and</font>

238
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,690
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that say about what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

239
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,750
looking for and seeking and drawn to in

240
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,520
people's identities so that's what I've

241
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">been thinking about today it is now 851</font>
