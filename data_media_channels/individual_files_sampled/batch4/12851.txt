Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona says that President Trump is Stalin Eskin his approach to the press the Democrats continue to go bizarrely insane over president Trump's bleep whole comments plus we may be about to find out what President Trump is like down there and I'm not talking about his hands oh god no please god no I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show yes indeed The Daily Beast is now reporting that stormy Daniels she of the 180 IQ and the presumably large breasts and she's a porn star she apparently had an affair with President Trump back in 2006 and now they are going to run a 5500 word interview with her about her sexcapades with Trump they'll discuss the impact of this and just screaming over and over and over then trying to gouge out our eyes before this interview can

that stormy Daniels is now going to drop a long story about how she had sex with Trump in 2006 and we're all supposed to act surprised over all of this the answer is no none of us are surprised over any of this president Trump's character has long been known his latest wife Melania the First Lady of the United States is his third wife he was having an affair with her one who's married second wife he was having affair with his second wife when he was married to his first wife so no none of this is particularly surprising also he obviously has a thing for models Melania was working for a modeling agency that I believe he ran at the Tyler that he owned at the time that they were married and posing in shall we say provocative ways and and then he said that he married her specifically because he wanted to make other men feel jealous when he walked into the room so it's not particularly surprising the Trump apparently had an affair while Melania was pregnant with Barron in 2006 so in touch magazine has now run excerpts from an interview with adult film star stormy Daniels for actual name is Stephanie Clifford wherein she detailed having this affair so apparently she he approached her in in a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July in 2006 rather just four months after youngest son Barron was born he and he asked for her number and invited her to dinner when she arrived he was wearing sweat pants and they ended up eating in his hotel room which is just a classy move I mean when I'm that that was my typical seduction move but I when I first met my wife I showed up in sweatpants looking with the homeless person and then I said you want to go upstairs it works great she excused herself to the bathroom when she emerged Daniels told in touch the Trump was sitting on the bed and invited her to join him she thought oh here we go and then she went through it in anyway because apparently this is what people do I'm completely bewildered by the sex habits of rich and famous people I know that now I'm somewhat rich and also somewhat famous but I'm still bewildered by this hi this has not changed my view of sex is supposed to work apparently according to The Daily Beast the full unedited interview that will run later this week is five thousand five hundred words of cray so we can all look forward to that apparently she is going to drop full-on explicit descriptions of the president's junk so this will make the second president in the last four about whose junk we know far too much so that's going to be very exciting I'm so glad that the media are on top of this thing meanwhile Senator Jeff Flake is right now taking to the floor of the Senate to rip president Trump over his treatment of the press I'm very disappointed because today if you recall was supposed to be the day when we were gonna get the fake news Awards it was supposed to be last week then it was delayed till today and now it has been downgraded to a potential idea so it turns out the fakest news was that there was a fake news awards that is not actually taking place but Jeff Flake took to the floor of the Senate flank of course is leaving the Senate he was probably not gonna win reelection probably gonna lose his primary in Arizona anyway so he is leaving but not before he throws a few brick bats at his fellow Republicans and at president Trump over his treatment of the press some of this is earned a lot of it is Jeff Flake posturing here is what flake had to say no longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to those assaults on our institutions and mr. president an American president who cannot take criticism who must constantly deflect and distort and distract who must find someone else to blame is charting a very dangerous path in a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to that danger yeah the idea that Congress has not checked the president wondering how they're supposed to check him when he says dumb stuff like fake news about things that are not fake news now we'll get a little bit later to actual fake news you know the how the media have covered for example president Trump's health the suggestion that he is demented or that he is in the early stages of Alzheimer's that he's totally crazy or that he's about to die of a heart attack all of this nonsense and that was proved on since yesterday by a doctor for the White House was evaluated presidents going all the way back to Obama and and who basically gave Trump a clean bill of health and media refused to accept that but the idea that Congress is is sort of sitting around doing nothing when Trump says bad things I'm wondering where is this purported silence I'm hearing so much about I keep hearing their silence when Trump says stupid stuff about the media well I'm not silent I know a lot of Republicans who aren't silent Democrats certainly aren't silent the media certainly aren't silent that Jim Acosta certainly is in silent even when Trump just throws - even when Trump does something that's not terribly wrong - Jim Acosta Jim Acosta is on CNN whining about it the White House correspondent for CNN for example this happened yesterday with regard to the media here is Trump was being asked questions by a cost Acosta just won't shut up and finally Trump says get out Jim Acosta mr. president just say that you want more people to come in from Norway did you say that you wanted more people to come in from Norway is that true mr. president I want him to come in from everywhere everywhere thank you very much everybody just Caucasian or white countries sir do you want people to come in from other parts of the world where they're people of color and not sure if you can hear the end of that there wolf but as I tried to ask whether he wanted more people to come in just from white or Caucasian countries he said out he pointed at me and said out as and get out of the Oval Office okay and then he says out he says out to a Cossack has a costume won't show up and then Acosta goes online and whines about it on Twitter oh he said out to me yes I'm sure Jim it was just like the journalists who are being jailed in China this idea that the media are being somehow stonewalled by the Trump administration it's the leakiest Administration in American history and from loves the press I mean he's talking to the press on a non-stop basis Jim Acosta playing the victim is just a little bit silly you know I think that the president should not say what he says about the press I've said that many times I've said it throughout the campaign I've said that the attacks on the fake news media are ridiculous attacked the fake news when it's actually fake news don't attack it when it's not fake news but the idea that Trump is doing something you know that is under there that is undeniably destroying the image of the press among the American people pretty sure the press did that themselves and they continued to do it themselves on a fairly regular basis and just to finish with flake here's what flake had to say about politicians attacking the press and so we know well that no matter how powerful no president will ever have dominion over objective reality no politician will ever get us there tell us what the truth is and what it is not and anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the press for his own purposes should be made to realize his mistake and to be held to account that is our job here that is just as Madison Hamilton and Jay would have it isn't I'm fine with criticisms of President Trump that are earned again I think that flake making a big deal out of from suit acts on the press why don't we wait for like an actual Trump attack on the press that is worthwhile this is a pre-planned speech that he was announcing five days in advance how he was gonna go after Trump from the Senate floor this for like sort of wants to run for president it was bad timing for him because this is the same press that is busily going after Trump's health so as I mentioned White House doctor yesterday said there are no concerns about Trump's cognitive abilities here he had to stay at the White House is that I watched some of his press conference live went on for like an hour him just talking about the president's help dr. Ronnie Jackson the presidential position and the press just cannot believe that Ronnie Jackson is giving frump a clean bill of health and not declaring him a nut so I had no intentions whatsoever doing that like I said because I didn't feel it was clinically indicated and part of the reason I didn't think it was clinically indicated is because I've spent almost every day in the president in the president's president since January 20 2004 you know last year when he when he got into office and I've seen him every day I seen one two sometimes three times a day because of the location of my office we have conversations about many things most of not most don't revolve around medical issues at all but I've got to know him pretty well and I had absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability or his you know his neurological function so I was not gonna do a cognitive exam I had no intention of doing one the reason that we did the cognitive assessment is plain and simple because the president asked me okay so so Trump took the cognitive assessment he scored 30 out of 30 on that and the Pres couldn't believe it and in just a second I'm gonna tell you what the press did about it this morning because it's it's just a mantra of the fact that this is not a one-sided battle it's not just from taking on the press it so obviously the press also taking on Trump in some pretty ridiculous ways first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at tracker so you need to find your keys you need to find your wallet right this is just an exercise that I used to go through every single day I'm on my way out of the house where's my wallet where's my keys my kids stole them and hid them somewhere how do I find them well the best way that you can find them now is with the tracker pixel because you'll never have to worry about losing your things again it's the lightest Bluetooth tracking device on the market you put the tracker pixel on whatever you tend to lose your keys your wallet your purse and then you install the app on your phone and you can use your phone to find your keys your wallet your purse or if you lose your phone then you can use your keys while in a purse you hit the the tracker pixel and actually rings through on your phone so this is a common complaint around in Shapiro household or was the idea that you lose your phone it's on silent you're trying to ring it and you don't know where it is well when you have the tractor pixel it just over rules that it makes a sound from your phone even if your phone is on silence and that ensures that you can find your phone even though you put it on silent and then forgot to take it off silent later when you misplace an item that has a tracker pixel attached again a 90 decibel alert helps you find it in seconds and you can even locate your item if it's miles away because every a current user is part of the largest crowd locate network in the world so it's kind of like Waze except for finding things they also have a 30-day money-back guarantee which means you really don't have anything to lose so check it out save 20% off your order when you go to the track are calm it's the track are calm / been again the track are calm / Bend for 20% off the track are calm / been I said before it has been a saving grace in my marriage it has definitely helped relations in the Shapiro household because there's nothing worse than you're late for a dinner reservation and now you have spent 15 minutes looking for your car keys or my wife's phone which is what she usually loses it has definitely alleviated a lot of the stresses in the Shapiro house thank God those are the definite sense of the stresses in our house but it's it's stressful nonetheless which is why the track are so great the track are calm / Ben for 20% off and it lets them know that we sent you okay so I was talking about Jeff Flake suggesting the Trump's attacks on the media are bad yes they are bad I don't like them and he said that they he said that they inspired dictators around the world inspire is too strong a word the idea that that the mullahs are sitting around in Iran going ah now Trump attacked the press wish I had thought of that oh now I must not talk press like I don't know what that accent was but I certainly don't know where that logic would come from so the idea that they are there sitting around you know Kim Jong loon is sitting around thinking to himself yes Trump attacked the press now I'll be mean to the press just stupid the idea that it emboldened people because Trump isn't going to stand up for press freedoms in other parts of the world there's probably some elements of truth to that but when Trump attacks the news it makes it easy for him to attack the news when the media decide to be idiot so as I mentioned yesterday dr. Ronnie Jackson is the presidential physician and it came out and cleared Trump on health he also cleared him on heart health he said that Trump has excellent genes that the best genes the greatest genes here's doctor Randy Jackson talking about Trump's amazing James it's called genetics I don't know it's some people have you know just great genes you know I told the president that if you had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old I don't know I mean he he has incredible he has incredible genes okay so obviously the president wants the doctor out there saying that which is fine there's all these conspiracy theories going around now about Trump's height and weight people are calling them girth hers and center birthers because the the health report suggested that President Trump ways to thirty nine pounds into six three and four years he'd been saying that he was six two so apparently he gains an inch and that inch sort of prevented him from being labeled as obese as opposed to overweight as though it makes any sort of difference but here's the point his dad I think Fred Trump lived to something like 93 I believe let me let me see he he yeah he lives home 94 Fred 93 I was right the first time Fred Trump lived til 93 Trump is only 71 now so just based on life expectancy and families who'd be likely that Trump does fine right that Trump lives fine so the the doctor comes out and he says the Trump does not suffer from a heart disease well today Sanjay Gupta over at CNN came out and say well hold on a second he does suffer from heart disease Trump does have heart disease now Sanjay Gupta has not actually examined a Trump he doesn't really know much about from self other than what Ronnie Jackson said but the media have jumped on this and now they're suggesting well maybe maybe people weren't forthright about all this maybe it turns out that maybe it turns out that that Trump business is healthy is we were led to believe oh this is wishful thinking because media actually hope that he dies I mean let's be blows to be frank about that so a lot of members of the media who hope that term stops drops dead tomorrow of a heart attack here's what Jackson actually said about Trump's heart disease he said he said he does not have heart disease he and the question was he had a CT scan before the chod calcium in his coronary blood vessels and Jackson said he does he did he had technically a non non clinical arthrosclerosis coronary arthrosclerosis and so that's been mentioned in previously previous physical exams he's had done had a coronary calcium score done in 2009 it was 34 he had a coronary calcium score done in 2013 it was 98 and then we did get a calcium score from this one I didn't mention it because I think it was clinically good information it was 133 so I had a conversation with the cardiologist not only at Walter Reed but at Cleveland Clinic and several other well-known institutions everyone saw that is reassuring he's gone this period of time and he's had that little of a change in his coronary calcium load so Sanjay Gupta says well he's suffering from coronary heart disease right so technically he is right so technically pretty much everyone is he scored 133 according to the the the WebMD carry a calcium scoring chart that means they have a moderate amount of plaque in your heart you have heart disease and plaque may be blocking an artery your chance of having a heart attack is moderate to high but it also depends on your age so if you actually go over to the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis which is an actual study that you can type in your information like your your your age and your race and your and your gender when you type in 71 year old white male and 133 calcium score that calculates that you are a that you are in the 46 percentile right say basically around average right that's kind of normal for your age into in terms of in terms of what you have plus Trump's calcium score has been stable over time in 2009 he was at the 47th percentile in 2013 he was at the 52nd percentile today he's actually at the forty second at the 46th percentile so he's actually doing better now than he was in 2013 by percentile in other words his heart is not getting bad as fast as other people his age their hearts are getting bad so the media are obviously over blowing this and trying to make it seem like Trump is on the verge of having a massive heart attack and and they're suggesting that you use the I test ok Trump is fat Trump doesn't exercise he doesn't eat well all of that is true it's also true that a lot of people who don't eat well and are fat and have good genes live till really old ages without actually having heart attacks it happens all the time George Burns smoked and live til 101 that doesn't say smoking is good for you but it does suggest that not every average means that you're going to be the guy who has the heart attacks the media I made a huge deal out of all of this in the same way that they made a huge deal out of the bleep all comments and the goal of all of this is to make it seem as though Trump in some way or another is unfit for office so I've said before I think that Trump does not have the character I would wish to see in the President of the United States but the media's attempt to recast Trump's health records as a real issue now it's just insane and that's one of the reasons why people don't take the media seriously when Trump attacks the media which he does so often and so repeatedly so meanwhile obviously the S whole controversy has now entered its sixth day and this will not end I again harken back to that time when the Obama administration when President Obama specifically said about an allied Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he was chicken bleep and that controversy lasts in under 24 hours I remember because I was there and helps cover it the the bleep whole controversy continues because the media wants portrayed Trump as a racist and not only do they want him to portray him as a racist they also want to use that portrayal in order to blame from for any breakdown on attack a deal so Trump yesterday came out and he sort of clarified his policy on all this he says listen regardless of what you think you've heard from behind closed doors here's my policy I want a merit-based system the merit-based system is based on who is highly educated who is highly skilled now there are a lot of people who are coming out and saying well a merit-based system is in and of itself discriminatory because there are people from different countries who are less educated and Trump is really saying he wants white people because white people from European countries are gonna have higher levels of education on average than say people from Haiti and who cares you know three generations ago my ground and great-grandfather came here and he had no education and he did great well that's true I mean three generations ago my great-grandfather came here in 1907 and he did grade two he didn't speak didn't speak the language I'm not sure his educational level was the difference is there wasn't a massive social safety net and redistributionist Network that was designed to pick up the slack for him if he failed the idea was that we were self selecting better immigrants in terms of people who are entrepreneurial because they knew you come here you're not hands in anything and if things go wrong you're basically on your own right these are risk seeking people who came over to the United States in an attempt to better themselves it's not the same thing as people who are coming over here for redistribution and even if you're saying people are coming here to better their lives they're not coming here for redistribution if you know there's a social safety net that is going to change the level on average of people who are coming into the country just the way you're going to change the clientele of your restaurant if you say that it's a hundred bucks a plate whereas if you say all the food is free that's gonna change who shows up for your restaurant there's a difference in a soup kitchen and a five-star Michelin Rathod rated restaurant so the idea that that you are you can change the state how the United States works and not change the nature of immigration coming to the United States which necessitates a change in the standard that you're using for immigration is just le so here is Trump saying listen I want to immigrants from everywhere but I want a merit-based system I just want to thank everybody for being here did you say that you wanted working thank you very much thank you very much I want him to come in from everywhere everywhere thank you very much everybody to the left should be jumping on that and saying okay well there's from são Paulo G right if there are smart what they would say is we want a merit-based system too and that's why what Trump said about Haitian immigrants is so terrible because there are plenty of Haitian immigrants who'd be great here and then instead they they won't say that they don't want a merit-based system they do want to discriminate on the basis of country of origin it's one of the big problems and they continue to rip on the Trump administration as though the Trump administration is on the verge of deporting all the dreamers I know that's the dream of many of the hardliners in the Republican caucus and a few members of the sort of Ann Coulter Breitbart base but the reality is that's not what Trump is discussing right now Christian Nielsen is the Secretary of Homeland Security and she was specifically asked yesterday in a hearing whether the Trump administration was looking to deport so-called dreamers these would be people who are brought here as young people through quote unquote no fault of their own and now they've been here for nearly their entire lives here's what Nelson had to say it's not going to be a priority of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prioritize their removal I've said that before that's not the that's not the policy of DHS so if this doesn't get worked out and I am a dreamer the way I'm supposed to read what you just said is this is not going to be a priority of Vice if you are a daca that's compliant with your registration meaning you haven't committed a crime and you in fact are registered you're not priority of enforcement for ice should the program end okay so what she's what she's saying is basically daca is gonna remain in place even if Congress doesn't do anything about it which suggests that the two sides are really not that far apart on this thing Republicans just want some of trumps immigration priorities put in place but Democrats have no interest in providing that because in all likelihood we're not gonna deport these folks in any case so why are the media going so nuts over this why are they going to nuts over the bleep hole comment when the policy is basically so consistent when it appears that nothing really is going to change because obviously they're trying to get the Republicans to cave on all of their political priorities and I'm gonna show you how that's the case in just a second Plus Cory Booker just loses his mind I mean absolutely loses his mind it's the greatest case of acting since jon lovitz I mean it's acting it's amazing and I haven't been this moved by a piece of acting that I've seen recently since since Tommy Wiseau it's just incredible so we'll get to that in just second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Bull and branch so you know people don't agree on everything but I think that everyone can agree that you need a good night's sleep I definitely need a good night's sleep I value my sleep I Lee and that's why I need bull and branch everything bull and branch makes from bedding to blankets is made from pure 100% organic cotton which means they start out super soft and as you wash them they get even softer over time and you are buying directly from them so you're essentially paying wholesale prices luxury sheets can cost up to a thousand bucks in stores but bull and brand sheets are only a couple hundred bucks the sheets are so good that I've bought a bunch of pairs on my own we put them basically all the rooms of our house we put them in the kitchen because they're so comfortable I mean they're just they're supremely comfortable when I'm at a hotel on the road I don't sleep as well because they don't always have bullet and branch sheets everyone who tries these sheets loves them that's why three ex-presidents sleep on them Plus Bill Clinton's lovers presumably to get you started right now my listeners get 50 bucks off your first set of sheets at Beau and branch comp promo club and Plus by the way shipping is free and you can try them for 30 nights if you don't love them then you send them back and you get a full refund you're not gonna want to send them back they are that good right now listeners as I say 50 bucks off your first set of sheets at bull and branch com promo Claire bennigan that's bull and branch comm promo code been 450 bucks off your first set of sheets of Bo LL and branch comm promo code Ben go ahead and check it out Bolin Brad comm promote Club Ben and that lets them know that we sent you as well again 50 bucks off your order alright so the question is Trump is signaling he wants a merit-based system I put aside the bleep hole comments because those happened a week ago and a new cycle speak that's like basically new cycle speak is sort of like dog ears right every week is seven years in new cycle speaks so a new cycle speak this happened a long time ago we're still talking about it why are the Democrats still keeping it alive because they're more interested in using it as a club to beat Trump than actually coming to some sort of agreement over data so here's the DHS secretary yesterday testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary is the Senate Judiciary Committee I believe and she says she's not gonna talk about these comments and then Democrats lose their freakin minds at any point in that conversation on Thursday did the president United States use that four-letter word in with us in combination with any other words or alone that you heard there respectfully I have answered this I've been very patient with this line of questioning I am here to tell you about the threats our country faces and the needs and authorities that are needed by the department of homeland security if nothing further to say about a meeting that happened over a week ago I'd like to move forward and discuss ways in which we can protect our country okay and this promise the Democrats to just go not so Kamala Harris our awful awful senator from the state of California she suggests that the secretary herself might be a racist because there's what we're gonna do now we're just gonna we're gonna race bait all the way all the way till the end again I thought Trump's comments were at best ill-advised and at worst reeks of racism I think there's a plausible interpretation that does not have anything to do with race I think that in in my opinion that may be the slightly more plausible interpretation but the idea the Secretary's racist is insane it doesn't matter she suggests that the secretary is racist anyway this is a pivotal moment in the history of our country is it when we are having discussions about whether the people of Norway and I will use your words Madam Secretary and you spoke about how they were referred to as by contrast to the people of Africa and the various country the 54 countries of Africa and Haiti and we speak of them and you spoke of them according to the President as the people of Norway well you know they work very hard the inference being the people of the 54 states of Africa and Haiti do not you must understand the inference the reasonable inference that the American public is drawing from the words you speak much less the words of the President of the United States so now she's suggesting that Nilson is a racist so everyone's a racist right Nelson is sitting there basically saying I didn't hear those comments maybe she's lying maybe that's not for maybe she didn't hear the comments it doesn't matter the bottom line is she didn't say anything in this hearing those racist Kamala Harris is gonna keep screaming racism so that nobody actually has to discuss what to do with the dreamers and the truth is that Trump doesn't want to talk about the dreamers Trump basically was willing to cut any deal that he could cut at the very beginning until the spine stiffener was put in him by Tom cotton as well as as well as a couple of other senators but the Democrats lost their minds history so Cory Booker just goes nuts I mean he goes full-on John it's acting course crazy here I mean it's Lisa is tearing him apart I mean he just he goes he goes ballistic and he's bad at this I mean really bad at this this is not even good acting he says he cried tears of Rage tears of rage I'm gonna talk a little bit about tears in politics in just a second because I hate this crap but here's Cory Booker just putting on his mr. Potato Head angry eyes in order to in order to rip into Nilson and Trump in an oval office meeting referring to people from African countries and Haitians with the most vile and vulgar language the language Fester's when ignorance and bigotry is allied with power it is a dangerous force in our country your silence and your amnesia is complicity right now in our nation we have a problem I don't know if 73 percent of your time is spent on white supremists hate groups I don't know if 73 percent of your time is spent concerned about the people in fear in communities in this country Sikh Americans Muslim Americans black Americans the fact pattern is clear of the threats in this country I hurt where dick durbin called me I had tears of rage when I heard about this experience in that meeting and for you not to feel that pain and that pain and to dismiss some of the questions of my colleagues saying I've already answered that line of questions with tens of billions of Americans are hurting right now because of what they're worried about what happened in the White House that's unacceptable to me you're out of order this entire Court is out of order never go full al pacino and injustice for all never do it it's just not good and so Cory Booker of course the left loves this sort of theatricality they love the Afrika leti and deception just like Ra's al Ghul they're totally into it they love Cory Booker yeah I mean it's it is Tommy Wiseau level acting like just look at carries the it's the greatest acting I've seen since I saw this yeah can I have a dozen red roses please oh hi Johnny I didn't know what you here you go that's me how much is it it'll be $18 go keep the change hi doggie you're my favorite customer thanks a lot bye bye bye I did not hit her it's not true it's both did not hit her I did not oh hi mark yep there it is okay there it is that's it there it is there is your there is your cory booker moment from tommy wiseau I didn't you did not hit me oh hi secretary Nelson like what is this what is this nonsense then all this posturing you think they're really you think if you think Cory Booker cried tears of Rage first of all man up dude Craig tears of Rage you do politics for a living you know how many times I've ever cried about politics itself this many times zero I do it every day I'm doing it every day since I was 17 people say horrible crap all the time not just about politics generally but to me specifically and then Cory Booker talks about I get death threats yeah I've been there you know many times I whined about that in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee maybe that oh my god first of all what a secretary Nilson have to do with death threats the Cory Booker received I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to hear the explanation on that one I'll also point out here that it lets say for example that Hillary Clinton had been testifying in front of Republicans and they had started yelling at her the way Cory Booker was just yelling at secretary Nelson it's suggesting that your silence is complicity hey going full-on nutjob with it with the with the Pan's Labyrinth hands up here right oh I'm a moose right that that's basically what what cory booker is doing there he does this this insane routine imagine that we're republicans doing it to a democrat woman with the cries of sexism ever stop we're still hearing about she persisted because elizabeth warren wouldn't be quiet after she was told to be quiet by the rules of the senate and then it was oh she persisted she put what a brave woman would have brave limba cory booker rips this lady up and down for basically doing nothing right and you know what a hero he is what a hero in the this sort of this sort of nonsense just makes me sick to my stomach it's really stupid and it's really gross in its really opportunistic cory booker wants to run for president so does Kamala Harris maybe they'll have a cry off somebody call them I'm gonna talk

supposed to cry it was a sign of weakness to cry in American politics it showed that you were a wimp it showed that you couldn't handle the stress of high office now if you don't cry you are considered not in touch with your feelings I like it better the old bleh I don't want my leaders to cry and there are times by the way when it seems entirely appropriate for me to for people to cry like if you see a wounded soldier you're in a situation where you see a suffering child these are times when you cry you're walking through a Holocaust Memorial where there are times where tears I think are not out of bounds but the idea that you cried when you heard because the president said that there are some bleep whole countries women that just tears of rage first of all it sounds like a really terrible romance novel from Danielle Steel tears of rage with Korey Booker but let's go back to 1972 so all the way back in 1972 there was a there was a candidate for the presidency of the United States and the Democratic Party his name was Edmund muskie okay Edmund muskie was actually one of the frontrunners for the nomination he was the 58th Secretary of State under Jimmy Carter he was a senator from Maine from 1959 to 1980 and he was considered somebody who was probably gonna run strong in the 1972 election cycle so the polls for him were pretty good he was considered a front-runner in in 1970 he declared that he was going to run in the Iowa caucuses however George McGovern one and then muskie ended up going to New Hampshire and in New Hampshire he made a statement his wife was being attacked in the middle of the so he he he won in the New Hampshire primary and then his wife was attacked by the press and he made an emotional defense of his wife and in that defense it looks like he was crying right here's here's what the video looks like gonna sound to be a gutless coward maybe I said all I shouldn't mr. fortunate for him he's not on this platform beside me okay so he was ripped up and down right he's ripped up and down because he was supposedly crying here it turns out that that was actually just melted snowflakes because you can see that it was snowing outside but the press reported lying that the muskie had broken down and cried and that basically ended his candidacy right that ended his candidacy so we used to have a country where if you cried about people attacking your wife then that was considered wimpy now we have a cat now we have a country where Cory Booker whines about how he cried tears of rage when he heard that the president said something in a behind closed doors meeting and we're supposed to take that seriously by the way Cory Booker is a serial fabulist okay Cory Booker makes crap up on a fairly regular basis there's a story from a few years ago where Cory Booker used to go around talking about t-bone okay t-bone was a fixture of Booker's unsuccessful 2002 mayoral bid in Newark and he used to talk about his friend at t-bone and his friends he bone was alternatively a drug pusher would threaten his life and then sobbed on his shoulder according to Eliana johnson she's now over at the Washington Post I believe she was then a National Review she says the tale is when Booker admits he's told a million times but the in Booker's mind according to city councilmen it's not so much the details of the story that matter but the principle that these things happen they happen to real people they happen in the City of Newark the t-bone does not apparently exist so there's a Rutgers University history professor named Clement price of Booker supporter he told National Review Online he found the mayor story offensive because it pander to a stereotype of inner-city black men t-bone Price says is a southern inflicted name you would expect to run into somebody or something named he bone in Memphis not Newark Price said that he was a mentor and friend to Booker and says Booker conceded him in 2008 the t-bone was a composite of several people he'd met while living in Newark the professor said that he told Booker he disapproved of him inventing such a person he said if you're gonna create a compromising of a man along High Street why don't you make a WB Dubois Booker agreed that it was a mistake and then Booker stopped talking about t-bone he's never admitted by the way that t-bone does not exist but he has defended t-bones existence over and over this is not the first time of course that he fib in 2007 he described Newark activist Judi Diggs as a potty mouth educator who was always called cussing out my mama cussing out my daddy and said she had died in truly poetic way reading to children the Diggs family was angry they came forward they said that was a lie she died in her office and then Booker emphasized that his apology he apologized and said that all of that was in bad taste and again he's talked over and over about tea buns I walked up to this charismatic black guy my age called t-bone who was one of the drug lords I just said yo man what's up and he leapt in front of me looked me right in the eye and said who the blank do you think you are if you're so what you look at me again I'm put a cap in yo ass yeah this doesn't sound stilted at all but that's who cory booker is and now he's being trotted out as a hero so this is the way we're gonna do this whoever demonstrates the most emotion whoever demonstrates I think it's true on the right as well as on the left whoever demonstrates the most emotion wins I think this is one of the reasons Trump won the nomination as could Trump does angle really well Cory Booker is not all that good at anger I mean again that acting job is really not good it's a really poor acting job but it allows people I'm left to feel that he is cathartic outlet for their emotions he is an avatar for what I'm feeling I'm feeling so mad and so angry and crying tears of rage that Cory Booker is just my guy how about this how about our politicians don't have to be avatars of your feelings heaven it's the stupidest measure they say the most important measure in presidential politics is quote unquote cares about people like you I think this is a stupid measure because the way that people measure caring typically is not what you do for somebody else but how you feel about somebody else I hate intense based politics I hate it I don't think that your intentions matter nearly at all I don't think your emotions matter nearly at all I think that what you do matters right I'm of the Batman school of thought right it's it's it's not what's under the mask it's what I do that defines me right that that that's the school of thought that I apply to politics I apply it to life as well by the way I'm an axe based person I'm happy with people and I think they're doing the right thing I'm unhappy wanting to do the wrong thing but in politics too often it's oh they care about people like me because they shed a tear because I know that deep down they care about my concerns how about we stop worrying so much about how people care and what they think about their emotions and we worry more about what they do if we did that we'd have a doc I deal probably in the next couple of days here I mean while the Democrats are never gonna stop with it's a dick Durbin Wilmont stop he says the Trump says that we need more Europeans we need more people from Norway again I find the the ire from dick durbin over Trump saying that there are bleep whole countries out there a little bit ironic considering that he suggested back during the Iraq war that American soldiers were the equivalent of Nazis or the soldiers of Pol Pot from Cambodia now here at Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois Bregan but it was a long far-ranging meeting about immigration in general negative things were said about Haitians coming to the United States the president was talking and I think this is a tell if you will we need more people from Norway he said Norway they don't even take refugees in Norway said and I just met with a Norwegian Prime Minister and we need more Europeans we need I mean it was pretty clear to me what the president's message was in that meeting okay okay well I'm glad that it was clear to him but we're now a week out and nothing has changed Sarah Huckabee Sanders I think his probably is right on this now we've wasted a week fighting over Trump's verbiage behind closed doors why don't we actually get to the policy and then see if Trump actually wants to take in refugees from Norway but not Haiti how about that yeah one of the rare times while sided with with the the press secretary here's what Sarah how could be Sanders said yesterday look I wasn't in that room so I can go only off of what the individuals who were they said that term wasn't used but that tough language was look no one here is gonna pretend like the president is always politically correct he isn't I think that's one of the reasons the American people love him one of the reasons that he won and is sitting in the Oval Office today is because he isn't a scripted robot he's somebody who tells things like they are sometimes and sometimes he does use tough language the point that he's trying to make the point that the entire conversation frankly should be focused on is the issue at hand we've wasted five days fighting over one word when we should be fighting over the the people that are involved in the daca program if Democrats really want to protect these individuals that's who they should be fighting for and that's what they should be fighting about is figuring out a permanent solution to daca okay so it's the end of this Agreement not the part where Trump is politically incorrect I always object to equating political and correctness with with just being offense and silly but what she says at the end here is right that why are we still talking about this like why are we why can't we move on from this you've already made your minds up right you've already made your decision what do you want Trump to say at this point well you really want Trump to say is I resign you're not gonna get that what you really want Trump to say is I was a racist you're not gonna get that either so I guess we can keep just beating Trump about the ears on this comment but it's pretty obvious what the agenda is at this point okay meanwhile I in other news there's more nonsense from the me2 movement feminists are freaking out as I mentioned briefly yesterday at Margaret Atwood the author of the the famed book The Handmaid's Tale which is not a very good book but she's considered a feminist icon what did she do that's so wrong what's she done to piss off me the me2 movement well apparently there was a piece that she that she signed about how a guy named Steven Galloway the former chair of the Creative Writing Program at the University of British Columbia was facing serious allegations and that those allegations were not being properly examined that people were jumping to conclusions so Atwood pointed to the university's lack of transparency around the allegations and noted that Galloway had been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement she said quote the public including me was left with the impression this man was a violent serial rapist and everyone was free to attack him publicly since under the agreement he had signed he couldn't say anything to defend himself a fair-minded person would now withhold judgment as to guilt until the report and the evidence are available for us to see when she suggested this was like the Salem witch trials and that guilt was assumed of people who were accused a bunch of people on the Left win nuts on this how dare Margaret Atwood call for due process how dare Margaret Atwood suggests that we may not have all of the facts the longer the Miche movement continues with this the worse it's gonna be for them because we all agree that rape and sexual assault are bad but it is not out of bounds to suggest that we might need to see some evidence that in the initial phase we can believe objective claims about what a man has done but we need all the facts to come out and we need to hear what the guy has to say about it as well but that's not what the me2 movement apparently wants to do the Huffington Post has a piece that was leading last night about Aziz Ansari I defended as he's done sorry a couple of days ago I've been defending him now for a couple of days not because I think he's not a d-bag I think he is a d-bag but because I think that if there's any implication that he was sexually assaulting or sexually harassing this woman who came to his apartment got naked and performed sex acts on him multiple times before deciding she wasn't having fun that maybe she might have been sending some mixed signals is that a possibility like some mixed signals yeah I honestly I don't think it's particularly mixed when you get naked in the guy's apartment and perform oral sex on him twice like that doesn't seem particularly mixed to me that's that's pretty certain signal but apparently Aziz Ansari is supposed to be a mind reader so this is this article from The Huffington Post talks again about another story where a guy was not nice to a woman and how it made her feel used and we can't and we can't dismiss the Aziz Ansari story as me to movement run amok this is this writer says the sexual encounter grace described falls into what I see is a gray area of violating non criminal sex the kind of sex rebecca traced are described as bad in ways that are worth talking about and what Jessica Valenti described on Twitter is an interaction that the culture considers normal but it's oftentimes harmful harmful well maybe that's because the culture that the feminist movement created has destroyed the notion of normal sex maybe that's the problem and maybe we should start deconstructing that okay time for a couple things I like a quick thing I hate and then Bible talk so the things I like this is a minor thing I like today but I did enjoy Orrin Hatch who's gonna be the retiring senator from Utah he was in the middle of doing this questioning at the Senate Judiciary Committee of the Homeland Security Secretary and he saw it he forgot that he was wearing he was not wearing glasses and so this semi hilarious moment ensued thank you mr. chairman I'd like to begin with crucially employee side him going for those glasses that are not there and removing them I've never worn glasses I don't know if this is a regular thing that people do I assume that it's relatively common but duh minor thing that I like today we don't have to go any further than that okay time for a quick thing that I hate so my state California leads the nation in poverty doesn't matter we have a 13% state income tax does not matter we have a 10% sales tax does not matter we spend more money than any other state does not none of that matters all the matters that is the California continues to lead the nation in poverty we are one of the leaders in income inequality we have a tremendous homeless problem if you drive around LA it does look like a bleep hole la has become very shoddy and run-down the city of my birth and where I've spent the vast majority of my life and that does have something to do with the city policy pursued by Democrats in city governments in the City Council in the mayor's office for years on end and what's hilarious is that people on the left continue to be puzzled by this how could it be that California is just terrible hell right it's in the the the the report suggests that one out of five residents the other time says one out of five residents in California is poor so California has fallen behind our state's per capita GDP increase approximately twice as much as the US average over the five years ending in 2016 but the income inequality has gotten worse because the people who are making money at the top of the spectrum are people in Silicon Valley people in Hollywood people in the finance industry but all the people at the bottom are failing why because because it is very difficult to start a business and hire in in California regulations are really difficult there are eight hundred eighty three thousand full-time equivalent state and local employees in 2014 we have huge bureaucracy we have a housing crisis more than four in ten households spent more than 30% of their income on housing in 2015 that's because of regulations preventing new building in places like Los Angeles so you can't actually drive the market down in terms of housing all of this is what the people on the Left have wanted they designed this policy and now they own it California is in bad shape because of progressive policies it is simple it is just that simple there's no more to it okay time for a quick Bible analysis since it is Wednesday so I felt like this is one of the most moving portions of the Bible you know for all the people who talk about the Bible is sexist in the Torah is sexist and now all these religious people are so sexist this notion of how men and women are supposed to operate is more loving and more genuine and more real and more committed than anything that the feminist left has come with and this is written at least 3000 years ago right this is written in at the beginning of Genesis this is Genesis chapter 2 verses 22 through 25 and the Lord God built the side that he had taken from man into a woman and he brought her to man and the man said this time it is the bone of my bones and the flesh of my flesh this one shall be called a Shaw woman because this one was taken from each man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they shall become one flesh and then here is the key line right now they were both naked the man and his wife but they were not ashamed why weren't they ashamed why weren't they ashamed because there's nothing shameful about sex with a person to whom you are married there's nothing shameful about the idea of becoming one flesh with the person who is your soulmate and who is flesh of your flesh there is nothing shameful about the person you have chosen to create a life with having sex with you or being naked in front of you not only is there nothing shameful about it there's something beautiful about it but the beauty of sex is lost when it just becomes a series of casual one-night stands or when sex becomes about physical impulse rather than a spiritual of a physical desire to fulfill a spiritual impulse you got rid of commitment you got rid of love and now you're upset because everything's awkward maybe it's because you made bad decisions about how your sex life was going to go and because Society has made bad decisions to separate off spirituality and meaning and intimacy and closeness and love and commitment from the sex act itself and once man's reason pervades of one's man's just a desire to change how sex works prevails over the natural order and the natural order is the idea that man and woman are supposed to be in committed relations in order in order to have sex with one another right that's what the Bible is saying here once that happens you shouldn't be surprised when things go awry and that's exactly what's happened and that's why the me2 movement I think is destined to fail because they refuse to examine their underlying assumptions about what male-female relationships should look like where the two sides owes something to one another and therefore are not ashamed in the presence of one another okay we'll be back here tomorrow with much much more I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is
