1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,760
When I started my brief
and sloppy drag career

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,950
as Anita Lane Bryant
in Madison, Wis.,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,617
back in 2009, you could find
some drag tutorials online.

4
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:10,950
But the best way to learn how
to apply a fake lash, glue

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,644
down your eyebrows, or make hip
pads out of couch cushions,

6
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,060
was to head to the
nearest gay bar

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,380
and try to get into a drag
queen’s good graces.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,405
“Simply go up to them and say,
oh my gosh, you’re amazing.

9
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,530
Can you be my drag mother?”

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,579
But since then, drag has
exploded on the internet.

11
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:27,870
Tucking used to be something
that drag queens whispered

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,070
about to one another.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,410
But today, searching
how to tuck on YouTube

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,967
yields 2.4 million
search results.

15
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,300
If you’re trying to figure
out how to tuck in your shirt

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,090
or do flips on a
trampoline, those videos

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,085
are buried under these videos.

18
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,564
“The tucking panty holds
everything in place.”

19
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:45,480
Drag queens are no longer
just club performers

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,530
or titillating
talk show guests.

21
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,490
Online, they’re makeup
instructors, dance coaches,

22
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,650
storytellers and
international ambassadors

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,640
of being yourself.

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,455
“Just be yourself.”

25
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:55,130
“Be yourself.

26
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,714
It’s so easy.”

27
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:57,463
“Don’t you think I
should just be myself?”

28
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,040
It’s easy to see
the upside here.

29
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,060
“It gets better.”

30
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,410
“It actually does.”

31
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,200
And feel good video content
marketed to queers and allies

32
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,290
promotes the idea that drag
isn’t just for cis gay men,

33
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,810
it’s open to people of all
genders, all sexualities

34
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,320
and all ages.

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,475
But if internet has changed
how drag is produced —

36
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,575
“Work diva.”

37
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,020
— it’s also changing
how it’s consumed.

38
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,760
Queer internet
culture promotes drag

39
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,310
as an art form that’s
available to anyone.

40
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,280
“Anyone can do any
type of drag, no matter

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,465
what gender or anything.”

42
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:28,250
Which also means an
unprecedented number

43
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,349
of straight people are
consuming a queer art form.

44
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,390
Of course, queens have
performed for and profited

45
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,280
from straight
audiences for as long

46
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,545
as there have been queens.

47
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:38,620
“Well, you said you
wanted to go to slumming,

48
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,435
so I picked a place to
eat in the Village.”

49
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:41,726
But curious
straight folks used

50
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,630
to have to schlep to
a gay bar or drag club

51
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,970
if they wanted to
walk on the wildside.

52
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,130
Now, the world’s most
popular drag show

53
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,616
is no longer at a gay bar.

54
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:50,310
[cheering]

55
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,560
It streams on VH1.com, if
you happen to know someone

56
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,924
with a cable password.

57
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:57,890
[cheering]

58
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,510
“RuPaul’s Drag Race” has been
on the air for 10 seasons —

59
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,670
13, if you count “All
Stars” — and has launched

60
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,980
the careers of
126 drag queens,

61
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,680
spawned spin-offs, won
Emmys and subjected us

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,955
to dozens of dance anthems
by its contestants.

63
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:12,270
[singing]

64
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,370
It’s hard to say whether
“RuPaul’s Drag Race” is

65
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,620
a cause or a consequence
of the rise of drag

66
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,810
on the internet, but
RuPaul has become

67
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,120
the online avatar for drag.

68
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,630
When queer culture can
exist without queer space,

69
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,364
it can reach more people.

70
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:27,780
But when queer
culture is entirely

71
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,855
stripped of queer context,
it becomes something else.

72
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:32,355
“Ew.

73
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:32,850
Get off of me.”

74
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,641
In some ways, the
internet has allowed drag

75
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,820
to thrive more than ever.

76
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,225
“My friend Julie is turning
me into a drag queen.”

77
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,040
Along the way, doing
drag has become

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,972
a social experiment or a fun
stunt to post on socials.

79
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:45,430
“All the
single furries.

80
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,920
All the single furries.”

81
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,290
When any group develops
an online community,

82
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,750
it means that insiders can
connect to that subculture

83
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,447
more easily.

84
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:54,030
“What the hell is
that supposed to be?

85
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,280
The one on the right’s
not even synced.”

86
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,840
But so can outsiders.

87
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,360
That means that, you know,
professional internet critics

88
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,860
can make online
videos about you

89
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,930
for major news publications.

90
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,600
It also means that people
can admire, commodify,

91
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,400
ridicule and, uh, demonize
your subculture just as

92
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,460
handily.

93
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,190
“This drag queen demon
reading to the kids.”

94
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,005
“This man dressed
like a female demon — ”

95
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:19,225
“These drag queens,
man, just destroying

96
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,100
the whole wide world.

97
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,058
You can’t even tell if
that’s a man or a woman,

98
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:24,120
but that’s a man
dressed like a woman.”

99
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,910
The good news is that drag
has never been so accessible.

100
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,620
“Does anyone know
what a drag queen is?”

101
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,825
“A drag queen is someone
who express themselves.”

102
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:35,477
The bad news is that drag
has never been so accessible.

103
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:39,220
“The hips on the drag queen
go swish, swish, swish,

104
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,375
swish, swish, swish.”

105
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,120
“Hey, this is Amanda.”

106
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,790
“This is Shane.”

107
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,200
“He edits the videos.”

108
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,610
“She writes the videos.”

109
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,780
“Except for this video.”

110
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,112
“I wrote this video.”

111
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:51,290
“And if you like this video,
like, comment and subscribe.”

112
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,180
“And tell us, how much should we tolerate 
bachelorette parties at drag shows?”

113
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,400
“Answer in the comments.”

114
00:03:56,400 --> 00:00:00,000
“We are very thirsty.”
