00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:36,745
>> Greg: I WOULDN'T CALL IT

195
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,613
A BARBECUE AT ALL.

196
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:41,583
NOT ENOUGH FABIO MEAT THERE.

197
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,284
>> Kimberly: SITUATION WITH

198

203
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,357
>> Greg: I TRIED TO SET HIM

204
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:50,225
UP WITH FABIO.

205
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:50,959
SHE WAS INVOLVED WITH

206
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,426
SOMEBODY ELSE.

207
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:56,298

THAT'S FROM SARA.

218
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:11,480
>> Greg: PROBABLY WHEN WE

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,081
GET THINGS OUT OF STORAGE,

220
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,351
LIKE AUNT HELEN.

221
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:17,319
I DON'T HAVE ANY -- I DON'T

222
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,119

223
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,187
I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT IN

224
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:19,688
NEW YORK.

225
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:21,056
THE ONLY THING YOU DO IS

226
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,057
TURN ON THE AIRCONDITIONING

227
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,391
AND HOPE IT WORKS.

228
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,393
THAT'S MY TRADITION.

229
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:26,061
>> Kimberly: THEN YOU KNOW

230
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,297

244
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,050
SHOULD HAVE FUN.

245
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,252
FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO

246
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:51,386
IS REMEMBER ALL THOSE MEN

247
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:52,320
