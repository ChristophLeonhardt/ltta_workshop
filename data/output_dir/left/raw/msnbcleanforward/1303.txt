TEACHERS ARE SAYING, THERE IS A PROBLEM, BUT WE’RE NOT EQUIPPED

95

PROBLEM, BUT WE’RE NOT EQUIPPED TO BE THE PEOPLE THAT SHOOT

96
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:07,055
TO BE THE PEOPLE THAT SHOOT SHOOTERS.

WE RAISED THE ACCESS TO GUNS TO 21.

156
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:00,169
21. YOU DON’T HAVE KIDS WITH ACCESS

157
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,704
YOU DON’T HAVE KIDS WITH ACCESS TO GUNS THAT THEY MIGHT

158
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:02,805
TO GUNS THAT THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE DO SOMETHING WITH.

159
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:04,807
OTHERWISE DO SOMETHING WITH. HOW ABOUT RED FLAG LAWS?

00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:05,808
HOW ABOUT RED FLAG LAWS? THEY’VE ALREADY SAVED LIVES HERE

161
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:06,676
THEY’VE ALREADY SAVED LIVES HERE IN FLORIDA.

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,711
IN FLORIDA. THEY’VE BEEN USED A LOT TO

163
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:10,279
THEY’VE BEEN USED A LOT TO REMOVE WEAPONS FROM SOMEONE WHO

164
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,813
REMOVE WEAPONS FROM SOMEONE WHO INTENDS HARM.
