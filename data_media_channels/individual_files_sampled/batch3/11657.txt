a proud dad a proud Dane tonight because we were saying your son in gold your team won one room yeah then my one man one night was a really scrappy game and if Iceland defended in the last 20 minutes and defended deep well then might get exactly the same it was really a nerve wracking last period of the game for for me as a fan and I'm at the same time I have to say it wasn't a classic game it's not one of those you you want to watch again I think Peru they haven't found that figure they were trained or huffing and puffing but nothing really came to they had a few chances particularly at the end of the first half when they had that penalty call I think we can see the the highlights now it turned out to be a wasted opportunity too didn't it because this is the incident itself so the referee went to to evolve the video system the referee and he decided it was a penalty a I don't know what what he was doing here I mean lack of concentration the sort of the stop and the step up it was eventually he missed the penalty and I have to say I'm still a little bit in doubt trying to be neutrally and objective I'm little bit in doubt if it really was a penalty but then the day he missed appearances so there's no debate sure christian quaver putting that one over as a keeper as i said before you've been in that position a hugely important game you're standing there you know you've gone the wrong way but the player puts it over What's it feel like inside when you see that bull's eye over it's like standing there watching you team's gone it's the same thing it it works out the same way so it is it's really good you you tried to guess where is it gonna put the ball and as soon as he hit the ball you know straight away if you guessed right or wrong but then the next thing you realize is this is going over so first you got the disappointment of having chosen the wrong side and then obviously you get the jubilation because sure you know the balls not going to go in the back of the net and you were happy again weren't you cheering again just after the second half started because you got the breakthrough Gulf with Yosef Paulson and again someone who probably didn't have the best of game today and I was actually two minutes before he scored I said he needs to take him off because he's not doing his job and when you're under the cuff like like then my was for so long you need players to work out and he was he wasn't keeping the ball up and then Christian Eriksen got the ball he made a good run here we see and and the finish was fantastic clinical the goalkeeper comes out at the wrong angle III might suspect him that he didn't sort of think that the ball was gonna go that way but it left a little gap to the near post and he took that and took that gap and took full advantage of that so overall this evening are you satisfied with Denmark's performance I mean marks out of 10 what would you give them in terms of performance yeah in terms of output and gave 10 in terms of performance halfway there I think a 5 I think this team could do so much more than what really worked well today was the defense so they defended really well and obviously they can see the goal and in all this year of 2017 then what haven't conceded the role so that carried on so that's something to build on but but playing getting the ball up the pitch trying to or creating chances it wasn't great and there's something to work on but let me say this as well and it goes first we saw France early on today we've seen Argentina today the first game it's not why you win the world Carmel the first game and the second game and the third game is all about getting to the fourth game I know it sounds a bit sort of silly but that is all it is you play three games if you get four points you got a charity to get five points you're more or less sure so in those three games all about getting to those points sure then I got three points today so it's big smiles all around you
