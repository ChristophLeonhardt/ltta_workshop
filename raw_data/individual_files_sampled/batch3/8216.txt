NORTH KOREA AGREED TO DISMANTLE THE SITE. ONLY IF IT HAS THE FORCES IN SOUTH KOREA FIRST. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SPEAKING BEFORE THE UN TODAY. WITHOUT ANY TRUST IN THE U.S. THERE WILL BE NO CONFIDENCE IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE AS THERE IS NO WAY WE WOULD DISARM OURSELVES FIRST. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS WE ARE REAL PROGRESS THE ONE THING WE CAN SAY WE DON'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES BUT THE ONE THING YOU CAN'T SAY IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF NORTH KOREA'S SPEECH THERE WAS NO SIGN OF REAL PROGRESS. THE SECOND HALF OF THAT SPEECH WAS QUITE BELLIGERENT. THEY SAID THE FOLLOWING. THE PERCEPTION THAT SANCTIONS CAN BRING US ON OUR NEEDS AS A PIPE DREAM OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IGNORANT ABOUT US. THEY ARE DEEPENING THE MISTRUST. THE THING IS IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN EFFECT WHY GO ON ABOUT THEM. THAT'S WHAT HE DID. THE WHOLE THING IN THE SPEECH YOU CAN HEAR IT THROUGHOUT THE PROBLEM IS MISTRUST. AND THE REASON WHY IT'S MISTRUST IS BECAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES. BLAMING US FROM EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN. RIGHT NOW, OF COURSE THERE IS A LOT OF MISTRUST. BECAUSE THEY INVADED THE SOUTH KOREANS OF 1950s. AND THEY SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PAST OBVIOUSLY WE SHOULD. THE GAMES THEY ARE PLAYING. WE ARE SEEING THE SAME PLAYBOOK FROM KIM JUNG UN.
