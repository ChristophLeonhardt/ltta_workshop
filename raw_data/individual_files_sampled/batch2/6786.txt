DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER, HE WENT TO MICHIGAN, AND WHILE IN MICHIGAN HE DIDN'T BRING UP THE FLINT WATER CRISIS WHATSOEVER. HE WENT THERE TO SAY THERE'S MORE IMPORTANT STUFF, HE SAID THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE CITY IN MICHIGAN THAT HE WENT TO SO HE SKIPPED OUT ON THE MICHELLE WOLF CONVENTION TO SAY HE'S A MAN OF THE PEOPLE, AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT A MAN OF THE PEOPLE DONALD TRUMP IS, YOU HAVE TO CATCH IN BETWEEN MEMBERS ONLY EVENTS AT MAR-A-LAGO THIS WEEKEND. I TOO WOULD RATHER HAVE HIM IN WASHINGTON MICHIGAN FOR GOOD. WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE MICHELLE WOLF SITUATION? I THOUGHT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE, THE AMOUNT OF HEAT SHE TOOK. TO SAY THAT MICHELLE WOLF, A FAIRLY UNKNOWN COMEDIAN, IS BULLYING THE WHITE HOUSE, IS PREPOSTEROUS. SHE WAS HIRED TO ROAST THEM AND SHE ROASTED THEM. IT WAS TOTALLY FINE. WHAT THEY ARE REALLY MAD ABOUT IS THAT SHE MADE FUN OF THE MEDIA. SHE SAID THE MEDIA CREATED TRUMP, AND NOW THEY ARE PROFITING OFF OF HIM. AND SHE CALLED THEM OUT. AND SHE ENDED THE SEGMENT BY SAYING FLINT STILL DOESN'T HAVE CLEAN WATER. SO KUDOS TO HER, I THOUGHT SHE WAS FANTASTIC. SHE DID GREAT. SHE HAD A LOT OF JOKES THAT HIT. SHE WAS FUNNY, SHE HAD POINTS. I MEAN, THAT'S THE KIND OF COMEDY THAT I LOVE, COMEDY WITH A MESSAGE AND THE WHOLE POINT IS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE THE JOKES. IF YOU NOTICE, KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS MADE FUN OF BUT SHE WAS IN THE AUDIENCE. CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS MADE FUN OF IN THE AUDIENCE, REINCE PREBUS. THE CAMERA WOULD GO TO THEM AND THEN GO BACK. WHEN YOU SAW SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS UP IN THE FRONT, THAT IS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SMILE. SHE DIDN'T SMILE. SHE WAS SEETHING AND I FELT BAD FOR HER BECAUSE THE JOKES, THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT THE JOKE ABOUT THE LOOKS. I DON'T THINK IT WAS A JOKE ABOUT HER APPEARANCE. SHE SAID TWO THINGS, SHE TAKES LIES, TRUTHS AND BURN THEM, SHE BURNS FACTS AND MAKES A SMOKY EYE WITH THEM AND THE OTHER ONE WAS I LOVE YOU AS AUNT LYDIA IN THE HANDMAID'S TALE, PLAYED BY ANN DOWD, BUT ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT COMPARING HER, I DON'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARILY THAT THEIR LOOKS ARE BOTH BAD BUT RATHER, SHE IS THE FRONT MAN FOR THE TERRIBLE TOTALITARIAN REGIME. SO THEY WERE THE BUTT OF JOKES IN TERMS OF, BUT REGARDLESS, SHE IS SITTING UP THERE. THAT IS THE POSITION AND SHE DID HER JOB. THE PRESS, FIRST OF ALL, SOMEBODY HIRED HER SO YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING AND SECONDLY, EVERYONE IN THE PRESS WAS CRITICIZING THAT, THEY DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO STAND UP TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND MICHELLE WOLF, SHE SPOKE A LOT OF TRUTH SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO STAND UP, DON'T GO AFTER A COMEDIAN WHO HAS THE BALLS. YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO BE FUNNY AND MAKE A POINT? YES. THEY ARE LIKE WE HIRED A COMEDIAN AND WE CANNOT BELIEVE THEY TOLD JOKES. IF YOU WANT SOME SILLY GUY, GET A TRUMP IMPERSONATOR. READ THE SCRIPT FOR HIM. DO YOU KNOW WHAT WAS OFFENSIVE? THE TIME GEORGE BUSH DURING THE IRAQ WAR MADE, JOKES ABOUT, WHERE ARE THE WMDS? NOT THERE, NOT THERE. HE IS MAKING FUN OF THE FACT THAT HE COULDN'T FIND THE WMDS. SO THAT IS OFFENSIVE. PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND YOU ARE MAKING FUN OF THAT. AND SHE CALLED THEM OUT FOR LYING. THEY LIE EVERY DAY, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS LIES. DONALD TRUMP LIES SO SHE CALLED THEM OUT IN VERY FUNNY WAYS. WHY IS THE PRESS SITTING THERE GOING ALL MY GOD, I CANNOT BELIEVE SHE IS DOING THIS. MAYBE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH. I WATCH, I DO A BREAKDOWN WHERE I STAND IN FOR SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS AND HONESTLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BY THE PRESS ALL THE TIME. I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE A SEAN SPICER THAN SARAH SANDERS BECAUSE AT LEAST SPICER IS UPSET. AT LEAST HE GETS MAD, VISIBLY UPSET. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS JUST SITS THERE AND RECITES LIE AFTER LIE, LOOKING PEOPLE DIRECTLY IN THE EYE. THAT IS ALL SHE DOES ALL DAY
