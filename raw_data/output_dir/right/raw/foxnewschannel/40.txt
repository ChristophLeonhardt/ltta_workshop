>> IF MAKING IT EASY TO BE

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,647
AN ILLEGAL ALIEN ISN'T

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:08,981
ENOUGH.

4
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:10,215
HOW ABOUT OFFERING AN AWARD

5
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:12,184
FOR BEING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.

6
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:13,419
NO SANE COUNTRY WOULD DO

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,319
THAT, RIGHT?

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,154
GUESS AGAIN.

9
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:18,257
>> I VOTED NUMEROUS TIMES

10
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:19,691
WHEN I WAS A SENATOR TO

11
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:23,695
SPEND MONEY TO BUILD A

12
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:27,266
BARRIER TO TRY TO PREVENT

13
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:28,133
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM

14
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:28,500
COMING IN.

15
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,802
>> PEOPLE WHO ENTER THE

16
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:31,770
UNITED STATES WITHOUT OUR

17
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:32,671
PERMISSION ARE ILLEGAL

18
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,273
ALIENS AND ILLEGAL ALIENS

19
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:35,507
SHOULD NOT BE TREATED THE

20
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:38,277
SAME AS PEOPLE WHO ENTER THE

21
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:38,777
U.S. LEGALLY.

22
00:00:38,778 --> 00:00:39,845
BRIAN: WHAT HAPPENED TO

23
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:40,445
THOSE PEOPLE?

24
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:41,313
WAIT A SECOND, THEY ARE

25
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:41,713
STILL HERE.

26
00:00:41,714 --> 00:00:42,781
THEY HAVE TOTALLY FLIPPED ON

27
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:44,616
AN ISSUE THAT HAS NOT GONE

28
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:44,917
AWAY.

29
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:46,084
HOW ARE THEY GETTING AWAY

30
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:47,719
WITH THIS?

31
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,420
STEVE: IT'S CALLED POLITICS

32
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,222
AND RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT TO

33
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:51,123
THEIR ADVANTAGE.

34
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:52,391
TOMI LAHREN IS THE HOST OF

35
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:52,891
FOX NATION.

36
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:54,259
GO TO FOX NATION TO FIGURE

37
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,161
OUT MORE ABOUT IT YOU ARE

38
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:57,462
JOINING US TODAY FROM LOS

39

ANGELES.

40
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:58,564
LOS ANGELES HAS CERTAINLY

41
00:00:58,565 --> 00:00:59,798
HAD AN IMMIGRATION PROBLEM

42
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,465
IN THE PAST.

43
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:02,467
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE

44
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:04,136
DEMOCRATS WHO BACK IN THE

45
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:05,537
DAY WERE FOR ESSENTIALLY THE

46
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:08,440
SAME THING THAT DONALD TRUMP

47
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,308
IS SAYING?

48
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:10,976
>> WELL, DEMOCRATS DON'T

49
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:14,212
JUST HOPE, THEY WILL ENSURE

50
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:16,315
THAT THE MIGRANT CARAVANS OF

51
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:17,749
TODAY ARE THE VOTERS OF

52
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,116
TOMORROW.

53
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:19,851
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY USING

54
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:20,986
THESE PEOPLE AS POLITICAL

55
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:21,887
WEAPONS AND FOOTBALLS IN

56
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:24,222
ORDER TO GET VOTES THE

57
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:25,090
DETRIMENT OF NOT ONLY

58
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,024
AMERICANS BUT LEGAL

59
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:26,424
IMMIGRANTS.

60
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:27,759
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE CALL THEM

61
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,761
ON IT WE REPEAT THOSE SOUND

62
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:30,896
BITES THAT THEY SAID LONG

63
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,297
AGO AND ASK THEM WHY THEIR

64
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,932
POSITION HAS CHANGED?

65
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,801
WHY DO THEY NOW PLACE

66
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:37,035
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OVER

67
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:38,003
LEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND

68
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:38,370
AMERICANS?

69
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:39,738
IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY ANSWER

70
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,239
FOR THAT.

71
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,073
AINSLEY: TOMI, WHAT NEEDS TO

72
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:43,642
HAPPEN NOW WHEN IT COMES TO

73
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:44,509
IMMIGRATION REFORM?

74
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,377
>> WELL, YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL

75
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:46,878
ABOUT A WALL AND PHYSICAL

76
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,947
BARRIERS AND IT SEEMS AS

77
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:49,614
THOUGH HILLARY CLINTON ALSO

78
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:51,716
FEELS THE SAME WAY ABOUT A

79
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:52,851
PHYSICAL BARRIER TO STOP

80
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:53,218
PEOPLE.

81
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,219
LISTEN, WHAT WE'RE SEEING

82
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,453
NOW WITH THIS MIGRANT

83
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:56,922
CARAVAN IS NOT A CARAVAN,

84
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,323
IT'S AN INVASION.

85
00:01:58,324 --> 00:01:59,524
WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE

86
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,126
ABLE TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS.

87
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,427
AND, YES, PHYSICAL BARRIERS

88
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:03,061
DO WORK.

89
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,529
I HAVE SPENT TIME WITH THE

90
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,096
BORDER PATROL.

91
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:07,098
I HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY GO

92
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:07,432
THROUGH.

93
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:08,433
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE GREAT

94
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:09,134
TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER YOU HAVE

95
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,267
A PHYSICAL BARRIER YOU ARE

96
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,037
ABLE TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES

97
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:13,705
IN OTHER PLACES WHERE A

98
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:14,472
PHYSICAL BARRIER ISN'T

99
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:14,839
POSSIBLE.

100
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,940
YOU ARE ABLE TO STOP A LOT

101
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:17,308
OF THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

102
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:18,610
THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST, YOU

103
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:19,811
NEED TO GAIN THE TRUST OF

104
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:20,812
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND

105
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:22,447
BUILDING A WALL IS A FIRST

106
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:22,981
STEP TO DO IT.

107
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:23,848
THEN WE CAN DEAL WITH THE

108
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,016
PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY

109
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:25,316
HERE.

110
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:27,719
THAT WALL HAS TO BE FIRST.

111
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,120
BRIAN: NOW, WHEN DEMOCRATS

112
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:31,856
AND REPUBLICANS AGREED ON

113
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:36,594
GETTING RID OF CHAIN

114
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:37,662
MIGRATION, AGREED TO BUILD

115
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:39,564
THE BARRIER AND AGREED THAT

116
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:41,432
THEY SHOULD NOT IS HAVE FULL

117
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:45,403
FLAT ACCESS TO OUR COUNTRY

118
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:46,871
UNIMPEDED HE WOULD STILL

119
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:48,072
COULDN'T GET IMMIGRATION

120
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:48,373
DONE.

121
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:49,407
WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM EACH

122
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:49,841
OTHER.

123
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:50,475
MIKE POMPEO, THE SECRETARY

124
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:53,177
OF STATE, MADE IT CLEAR THIS

125
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:54,245
CARAVAN COMING HERE

126
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,514
UNACCEPTABLE.

127
00:02:56,515 --> 00:02:58,416
>> TO THOSE WHO SAY THIS IS

128
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,418
A HARD-HEARTED STANCE, LET'S

129
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,352
NOT FORGET THAT THE UNITED

130
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:02,820
STATES IS A HISTORICALLY

131
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:03,521
GENEROUS NATION WHEN IT

132
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:07,425
COMES TO IMMIGRATION OVER

133
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:08,459
33 MILLION PEOPLE TOTAL ARE

134
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,660
CURRENTLY HIRE WHO ARE

135
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:12,964
IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY

136
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:13,297
LEGALLY.

137
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:15,199
TO THOSE WHO WANT TO COME

138
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,201
HERE, COME HERE LEGALLY.

139
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:19,036
LEGAL IMMIGRATION IS THE

140
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:21,305
SUREST WAY TO OBTAIN THE

141
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:22,240
BETTER LIFE YOU ARE LOOKING

142
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,140
FOR HERE IN THE UNITED

143
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,177
STATES OF AMERICA.

144
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:27,612
FROM A SECURITY STANDPOINT,

145
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:28,813
THERE IS NO PROPER

146
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:30,214
ACCOUNTING OF WHO THESE

147
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,148
INDIVIDUALS IN THE CARAVAN

148
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:31,415
ARE.

149
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,551
AND THIS POSES AN

150
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:34,218
UNACCEPTABLE SECURITY RISK

151
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,621
TO THE UNITED STATES.

152
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:37,255
BRIAN: TOMI, HERE WE ARE.

153
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:38,623
THIS IS THE CARAVAN.

154
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,258
I DON'T HEAR A WORD FROM

155
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:42,293
DEMOCRATS.

156
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:42,927
WHY?

157
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:43,728
>> WELL, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN

158
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,129
ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL

159
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,765
THIS NARRATIVE THAT BORDER

160
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:48,432
ENFORCEMENT, BORDER

161
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,367
SECURITY, LAW ENFORCEMENT,

162
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:51,068
IMMIGRATION LAW IS SOMEHOW

163
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,137
BIGOTED AND INTOLERANT AND

164
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:53,971
UNFORTUNATELY, AS I HAVE

165
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,306
SEEN MANY TIMES WHEN I HAVE

166
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,141
GONE TO WEST HOLLYWOOD,

167
00:03:57,142 --> 00:04:01,112
WHICH WE KNOW IS REALLY THE

168
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:02,813
BAGSIAN

169
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:02,847
THGSIAN

170
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:06,517
THESIAN

171
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:08,352
BASTION OF LIBERALISM.

172
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:09,854
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM

173
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:10,721
INTOLERANT SO THEY WON'T SAY

174
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:12,089
A WORD ABOUT IT.

175
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,324
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

176
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:15,092
THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN

177
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:15,960
CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE IS

178
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:16,727
DONALD TRUMP.

179
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:17,828
I BELIEVE GOING INTO THE

180
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,864
MIDTERMS, I DON'T THINK THIS

181
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:20,965
MIGRANT CARAVAN IS GOING TO

182
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:21,866
HURT REPUBLICANS OR DONALD

183
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:22,166
TRUMP.

184
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,001
I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE

185
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:24,935
AMERICANS REALIZE WHAT'S AT

186
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:26,403
STAKE AND COME OUT AND VOTE

187
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:28,506
FOR BORDER SECURITY AND

188
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:28,973
ENFORCEMENT.

189
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:29,640
STEVE: YOU ARE SAYING THAT

190
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:30,508
THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE SAID

191
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,343
EARLIER THAT THE MIDTERM IS

192
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:34,245
ALL ABOUT THE CARAVAN AND

193
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:34,612
KAVANAUGH.

194
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:35,746
