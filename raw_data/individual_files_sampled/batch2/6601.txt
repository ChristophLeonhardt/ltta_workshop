secretary she decided to fill that department with former for-profit college executives that is important context for what I'm about to tell you so under the Obama administration there were new laws new regulations pertaining to for-profit colleges that were specifically defrauding students in their recruiting efforts they were telling these students yeah take out all these federal loans it'll be so worth it you're gonna you know take this course you're gonna take these classes you're gonna graduate and look at that 99% of our graduates ended up being super successful in this field so that was just an example of some of the you know fraudulent behavior that was going on with these for-profit colleges and all these students took out all this federal student loan debt that they were then unable to pay back because these were horrible institutions some of them weren't even accredited and so after some of these schools shut down Obama had a debt relief program set up for them so they're a student loan debt would be forgiven there were other programs as well where if you work in public service for ten years as long as you make your student loan payments on time and you're doing everything right after a decade you will have your student loan debt forgiven but then Betsy DeVos comes in and she's like I'm gonna scrap it I don't like this bye we're gonna we're gonna take some time to really re-evaluate it and we'll get back to you now a federal judge has decided no you can't do that it's lawful so US District Court judge Randolph Moss sided with consumer advocates and Democratic attorneys generals from nineteen states and DC who had challenged the Trump administration's postponement of the regulations known as borrower defense to repayment now Davis had taken actions to delay rules until July 1st 2019 in order to give the Education Department enough time to rewrite them now again it's important to keep in mind that the Education Department now consists of the very people who had participated in defrauding students so when they want to rewrite them that means we don't want to be able to forgive your student loans even though you were a victim of this fraudulent behavior the judge called her the boss's actions unlawful procedurally invalid arbitrary and capricious those are not positive words okay so apparently gave her a lesson okay so I love the judge's ruling because said why are you rewriting the rules they got robbed why don't you give them their money back and it's actually to be fair not even necessarily weighing in on the substance of it but the the way that they carried out delaying Obama's rules so they could rewrite the the new rules and by the way if you did it right procedurally it's okay you won the election kind of largely so and and so what you're gonna get to do is you let the Obama rules play out and then you get to write your own rules you do and then you could say hey students those of you who didn't get paid back in time we're gonna now rob you but just give it time so and but it can't stand it some of the kids who were ripped off are gonna get some of the some of their money back in that time period no I don't want them getting their money back again there's no guy I try to look what is the what is the governing philosophy here and it it when you look at people like Betsy DeVos and Scott Pruitt it really does boil down to what makes me look the most like a cartoon villain you know it's not truly conservative it unless you're a dedicated kleptocrat which does at least line up I was on the show Parks and Rec and at the beginning of that series when we were putting the show together the character of Ron Swanson was based on this person that we ran across in our research about local government which are these libertarians who don't believe in government yeah and they get into government to halt government uh and that was the the the descendant of Reagan's philosophy of government is not the solution to your problem government is the problem but I think what he meant by that was giving him a little bit of credit was it there's probably a private-sector solution to this that's better than the government solution and as somebody who's been in land the DMV I'll grant you that's but over the years that has become perverted to government is evil and now that another Ron Swanson people are gone and now you have people that are actively hostile to the concept of government Scott Pruett Betsy DeVos these people are the antithesis they are the personification of the antithesis of what their departments represent yeah it's it's giving phil spector in charge you're in charge of handgun safety you know so look i think the governor if that's all excellent points I think the government governing philosophy is what do our donors want I think it's just that simple so we keep looking at it from our perspective of like well how would that help the citizens you're supposed to be the head of the Education Department how does this help educate kids how does it help protect students but we're looking at it from the wrong lens their lenses how does this help my donors oh the for-profit colleges donate to the Republican Party and they rip people off now they got to pay him back well I don't want them to pay it back because they're my donors so what we see as the problem they see is the solution that's different yeah and and by the way so there are two issues that I want to make sure everyone knows the distinction and and Betsy DeVos has been horrible on both these issues the first one is the debt forgiveness program if you work in an approved public service type job that the federal government says yes you as you as long as you do this for 10 years after that 10 years is up we will forgive your student loan debt people that 10 years is close to up for a lot of people they've been applying to get their student loan debt forgiven Education Department responds by saying no sorry we're done but why but why no reasoning no nothing and then the second thing is the for-profit colleges some of which have shut down and DeVos refuses to forgive their federal student loan debt even though it's already been promised to them look I don't know why she's doing that with the people who have been defrauded by for-profit colleges because it's over I mean the for-profit colleges they made their money right and some of them had to shut down because of some of Obama's regulations but we're just talking about the students who have student loan debt tied to these schools that were worth nothing that gave them nothing and so the only thing that I can think of is well those students are paying interest on those debts right the those students pay a higher interest rate on their federal student loans compared to what the big banks had to pay back in those bailouts in 2008 and people make money off that one last thing here on the debt forgiveness they made a promise to those people but if you do that job we will forgive your debt and meanwhile when they when there was the housing crash they said look you made a promise to pay for that house and now you can't pay for that house that's a moral failing of yours but when the government screws over kids who relied on that or students who relied on that and worked up to ten years in a certain job based on that promise and then we break that promise that is also a moral failing of our government so we should recognize that and of course in this case the moral failing in my view unsurprisingly comes from Betsy DeVos too easy wasteful a Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our
