ask.fm yes and requires people to submit

25

questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I noticed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was</font>

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,099
so much pain coming through whether it

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,000
was so far suicide and speaking to

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
Carrie and Emma blackery at people like

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,240
that that's all they get outta school I

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,189
work in the mental health sector I'm a

31
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,110
volunteer for mind UK and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

32
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,530
what can I do with those skills and and

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,420
that because I have been through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,070
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in therapy myself for four</font>

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,490
years and I've had issues with the fact

36
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,100
that I'm gay and I still have issues

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,450
with the back home game which most

38
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,130
people fighting believe and that's why I

39
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,409
did the advice thing I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can use</font>

40
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,939
all the pain that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and</font>

41
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,490
I can read you get up and repackage it

42
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,500
and help other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a form of</font>

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">therapy is a form of fear me how does</font>

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you feel when you give out</font>

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,110
advice will I give out advice I need to

46
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,240
be needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm in therapy for one of</font>

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,670
that is why the reasons because it's a

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,649
it's almost become a full out because

49
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,810
I've worked myself to the point where

50
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,469
I'm physically and mentally<font color="#CCCCCC"> exhaustive</font>

51
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,850
which is why I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

52
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,878
advice videos so would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

do something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it too</font>

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,849
exhausting for you it was too much

55
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">because basically I set up</font>

56
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,689
see idea I don't do things by heart it's

57
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,010
easy i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm an all-or-nothing</font>

58
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,129
person and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i set up an advice tumblr and</font>

59
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:22,769
where people submit questions and I was

61
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,200
about so far I've all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about hey like</font>

62
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,450
hating yourself what do you think that

63
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,310
says about the kind of people who are

64
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,260
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube at the moment do you</font>

65
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,000
think that they are looking to the site

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,030
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find a community where they a lot</font>

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,370

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,720
I look to it do you think it's still

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,549
provider I think it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I I</font>

70
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,209

<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes be tough it's at home it's not</font>

91
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,359
bad because you make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video with</font>

92
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,370
someone it's often described as bad by

99
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,470
diving or no because its effort like

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,049
they probably just want to rub spoke to

101
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,659
marcus about<font color="#CCCCCC"> parties</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that they would</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just put out the video and</font>

103
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,409
that'd be that what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

104
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">future of YouTube is going to be when</font>

105
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are seeing people who are</font>

people running businesses they're not

108
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,879
seeing people pushing it out on a web

109
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,159
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the community do you think</font>

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,798
that that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to change the types</font>

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,228
of people that come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in i think is you</font>

112
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">really change some types of people</font>

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,740
coming in and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the you now</font>

now a lot of people have said why are

117
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,520
they bothering because all you've got to

118
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,020
do is go through the videos and just

119
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,450
fine fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> teller but that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

120
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,070
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point is it's an official</font>

121
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,900
thing or you still be here in five years

131
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,240
get adverts on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube yeah in 2006 I</font>

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,530
remember putting videos up and record

133
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,330
companies taking the covers down and

134
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,520
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just uploaded it again do it</font>

135

because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like people going to be at</font>

136
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,120
least thing I don't care what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

138
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,780
Sinatra cover up one more time so I

139
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,250
understand how YouTube is looking to

140
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,590
make some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we just got real</font>

141
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,350
but at the cost of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

142
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,240
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to say that that I</font>

143
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,730
don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but because i am very</font>

144
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,840
community driven but in reality again

145
