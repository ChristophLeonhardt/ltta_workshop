>> Sandra: NEW POLLING 15 DAYS
OUT IF MID-TERMS SHOWING THE
PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL RATING
RISING TO ITS HIGHEST NUMBER
SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE WITH 47%
OF THE REGISTERED VOTERS
SURVEYED.
NOW APPROVING UP 3 PERCENTAGE
POINTS FROM ONE MONTH AGO.
JOINING US NOW IS RONNA
McDANIEL.
CHAIRWOMAN OF THE RNC.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS
MORNING.
WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE RISE
IN THE PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL
RATING
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
LOOKING WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH
OUR ECONOMY.
3.7 UNEMPLOYMENT.
THE LOWEST SINCE WE PUT A MAN
ON THE MOON.
MORE JOBS OPEN THAN PEOPLE TO
FILL THEM.
WAGES ARE UP.
PEOPLE ARE DOING BETTER UNDER
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT'S
SHOWING IN THESE POLL NUMBERS.
HIS APPROVAL IS GOING UP
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR LIVES
ARE BETTER AND THEY ARE PROUD
OF THE JOB HE IS DOING.
>> Sandra: AS FAR AS THE
ENTHUSIASM GOES, THAT SEEMS TO
BE THE POPULAR WORD RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE TRYING TO SEE WHAT RIGHT
NOW ARE GOING TO BE THE BIG
ISSUES TO DRIVE VOTERS OUT TO
THE POLLS.
ARE YOU THINKING THAT AS WE
WATCH THIS CARAVAN MAKE ITS WAY
THROUGH MEXICO, WILL IT BE A
WINNING ISSUE FOR YOUR PARTY?
>> I DO THINK IT'S A WINNING
ISSUE AND THE PRESIDENT IS
HANDLING IT PERFECTLY TO SAY TO
THESE COUNTRIES PLEASE DON'T
SEND YOUR MIGRANTS HERE.
WE'RE GIVING YOU FOREIGN AID.
IF YOU'LL DO THIS WE'LL CUT
FOREIGN AID.
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS INFLUX OF
5,000 PEOPLE INTO OUR COUNTRY.
WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY BUT WE
HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE
WHO PAY TAXES, WE HAVE TO DO
THIS IN A SAFE WAY FOR AMERICAN
CITIZENS AND I THINK THE
PRESIDENT IS BEING TOUGH ON
THIS AND I THINK IT ALSO
HIGHLIGHTS DEMOCRATS AND SOME
OF THEIR VERY EXTREME STANCES
RIGHT NOW, ABOLISH ICE, OPEN
BORDERS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR OUR
COUNTRY?
WE NEED TO HAVE BORDERS.
WE'RE A SOVEREIGN NATION.
THIS IN THE LONG TERM I THINK
HELP US IN THESE ELECTIONS.
>> Sandra: ALSO THE LATEST IN
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL
TALKING ABOUT CONTROL OF
CONGRESS.
THOSE THAT PREFER DEMOCRATS IN
CONTROL 50%.
AND REPUBLICANS 41%.
I SAY THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF
THE PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL
RATING RISING BUT WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT?
>> WELL, HISTORICALLY THE PARTY
THAT HOLDS THE WHITE HOUSE
USUALLY LOSES SEATS IN CONGRESS
AND THE HOUSE SPECIFICALLY THAT
FIRST MID-TERM.
ALSO IN THE SENATE AS WELL.
THE SENATE WE'RE LOOKING AT
PICKING UP SEATS.
THE NUMBERS ARE LOOKING BETTER
AND BETTER.
AS WE PUT THE PRESIDENT ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL WE'RE RAMPING UP
OUR ENTHUSIASM AND HE IS MAKING
THE CASE TO REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
ALL THE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING
IN YOUR LIVES, THE HIGHER WAGES
AND JOBS COMING BACK WON'T BE
HERE IF DEMOCRATS TAKE THE
HOUSE.
THEY'LL SHUT IT ALL DOWN.
THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES AND
ABOLISH ICE AND OPEN BORDERS.
THE CONTRAST HE IS MAKING IS
CRITICAL.
IT HELPS RAMP UP OUR ENTHUSIASM
AND TURN OUT OUR VOTES WHICH IS
WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO WIN.
>> Sandra: NEARLY 2/3 OF
REGISTERED VOTERS SHOW AN
INTEREST IN THE ELECTION.
THE HIGHEST EVER REPORTED IN A
MID-TERM ELECTION SINCE THE
POLL ASKED THE QUESTION IN 2006.
HOW DO YOU WIN ON THAT?
>> WE SAW IN THE SPECIALS THAT
THE DEMOCRATS HAD A HUGE
ENTHUSIASM EDGE AS WE HAD THE
SPECIAL ELECTIONS.
REPUBLICANS ARE MATCHING THAT
WITH THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS,
SEEING WHAT'S AT STAKE.
RECOGNIZING IF PELOSI TAKES THE
LEADERSHIP WHAT IT WOULD MEAN
FOR OUR COUNTRY.
WE'RE MATCHING THE DEMOCRATS.
IT WILL BE CLOSE TO A
PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL TURNOUT IN
SOME STATES.
IT  IS INTERESTING SEEING THE
COMPARISONS TO 2014.
WE'RE LOOKING AT A HYBRID OF
2014 AND 2016.
WE EXPECT A VERY HIGH TURNOUT.
WE HAVE TO TURN OUT OUR VOTE TO
WIN AND WHY THE RNC HAS BEEN ON
THE GROUND FOR TWO YEARS AND
TRAINED 25,000 FIELD ORGANIZER
AND ORGANIZED OVER 200,000
VOLUNTEERS.
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT WILL
TAKE TO TURN OUT OUR VOTE AND
WIN IN THE MID-TERMS.
>> Sandra: WE HAVE YOU ON THE
PROGRAM REGULARLY.
CONSIDERING WE'RE JUST 15 DAYS
OUT NOW, HOW DOES THE WAY YOU
SEE THE MID-TERMS PLAYING OUT,
HOW DOES IT LOOK TODAY VERSUS
SAY A MONTH AGO?
>> IT LOOKS BETTER FOR US.
THE HOUSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR
CONCERN.
DEFY HISTORY.
I WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
LAST WEEK IN CALIFORNIA, IN
ORANGE COUNTY IN ARIZONA, AND
NEVADA AND SEEING THE
ENTHUSIASM RAMP UP AND LOOKING
AT THE EARLY VOTES IN THE
ABSENTEE VOTES.
WE GET THE TURNOUT NUMBERS
EVERY NIGHT.
I FEEL GOOD WHERE WE ARE.
I THINK WE'LL MAINTAIN CONTROL
IN THE SENATE.
PICK UP ONE OR TWO SEATS OF
MORE AND POSSIBILITY TO KEEP
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE WHICH
WOULD BE HISTORICALLY SOMETHING
THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN THAT
FIRST TERM OF A PRESIDENT IN
THE PAST 100 YEARS.
BUT IT WILL DEPEND ON OUR
VOTERS TURNING OUT.
THEY HAVE TO GO TO VOTE GOP.COM.
ENGAGE, VOLUNTEER.
WE HAVE TO TURN OUT THE BASE.
>> Sandra: FINALLY IF YOU WANT
THE PRESIDENT TO FOCUS ONE
PLACE, WHERE IS IT?
>> WELL, ALL THESE STATES THAT
HE IS GOING I WANT HIM
EVERYWHERE.
IF I COULD I WOULD CLONE HIM
AND PUT HIM EVERYTHING.
NORTH DAKOTA, WEST VIRGINIA.
HE WILL BE IN NORTH CAROLINA
THIS WEEK.
WE HAVE THREE VERY COMPETITIVE
HOUSE RACES THERE.
HE WILL BE IN WISCONSIN.
WE HAVE COMPETITIVE HOUSE RACES
THERE AND A GOVERNOR AND SENATE
RACE.
EVERYWHERE HE CAN BE WE'LL PUT
HIM THERE AND HE IS CAMPAIGNING
AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN ANY
PRESIDENT PREVIOUSLY AND
TOWARDS THE END YOU WILL SEE
HIM IN TWO OR THREE STATES A
DAY.
