Rach at erawan is upping the stakes against Saudi Arabia after the death of a Saudi journalist in Istanbul in a speech to Turkish Parliament erawan said the killing was premeditated and once the suspects tried in Turkey the Saudi Kingdom has issued conflicting statements about Jamal hisagi saying at first he was still alive then he was killed in a rogue operation then I think it was a fist fight the kingdom continues to deny that the crown prince was involved and just this week CIA director Gina has both traveled to Turkey looking for answers for more we turn to former CIA agent and whistleblower John Curtis karaoke thank you for joining us happy to do it well this is an interesting world that we're living in and the obviously situation none of us expected to be talking about but what do you make of turkish President Erdogan assertion that Chris Auggie's murder was planned weeks in advance and involved multiple teams of Saudi agents I think there are two things we should look at here one he's probably right that this is not something that you just do on a whim this is an operation that was very very poorly executed but probably was was conceived many weeks in advance but more importantly the Turks and the Saudis have not gotten along in years maybe decades the Turks have a very close relationship with the Qatar ease the countries are virtually in a state of war with the Saudis and the Turks are are absolutely obsessed with Kurds along their border of along the turkish-syrian border and of course the Saudis are financing and funding and arming fundamentalist groups in Syria so there are a lot of problems in Turkey Saudi relations the Turks have have a reason to try to embarrass the Saudis on this so I have to ask you a question going into if we had the intelligence to the United States was given the until that this was going to happen there was obviously enough things going on I think her saga Jamal himself actually said to his fiancee if I go in here if I don't come back out they've killed me why did he go in there if you knew there was that kind of a threat or is this just a threat that he lived under all the time and he probably said that about every building he went into I've spoken to friends of his over the past couple of weeks and they all say the same thing they all say that he was deeply worried about his own security now he wanted to fill out whatever form he needed to fill out in order to marry this Turkish woman he was engaged to here in Washington but he was told by the Saudi embassy in Washington that he had to do it at the consulate in Istanbul so they lured him to Istanbul and killed him inside he knew something bad could happen he was he was right the interesting thing to me is that the Saudis didn't think anybody would care or didn't think anybody would notice and we know now thanks to Jared Kushner that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has expressed surprise that this has become an issue at all well that's the question I mean can we believe the Saudis and their surprise are especially someone like the Crown Prince I mean how does this something happen to someone who is so high-profile that is so well linked I mean his family is very well entrenched in the area without so many of the high up knowing what was going on yeah you're exactly right masu the inexperience really of Mohammed bin Salman he bit off more than he can chew clearly on this operation the keshavjee family is not originally a Saudi family it's originally a Turkish family and so they have no no tribal background on which to rely and I think that in part that was one of the reasons why Mohammed bin Salman thought he could get away with this well that's the question what does this reveal about the NBS mindset did they kind of is this kind of a humbling experience or does this been happening and we're just now finding out about it I hope this is more than a humbling experience Mohammed bin Salman has shown repeatedly that he is not equipped to lead this kingdom he's launched an illegal war against Yemen he has ruined relations with Qatar he's murdered Jamal cooked you now it's time for somebody to to step in and change this leadership I think you've spent much of your adult life in Saudi Arabia what do Americans need to understand or have failed to understand about the kingdom and the political culture that's evolved especially in the region of Wahhabism the saudi version of Islam Wahhabism Wahhabi Islam is the most fundamentalist strain of the religion and so what Americans I think don't understand is that the relationship that we have with the Saudis is based and tirely on money they sell us oil we sell them weapons and we pretend that we're friends we pretend that we have a special relationship in fact we don't have a special relationship it's transactional nothing but transactional and then we choose to overlook their fundamentalism don't forget that 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudis don't forget that Saudi NGOs and governmental organizations were implicated in the financing of the 9/11 attacks the Saudis really are not our friends and we should not trust them in an operation like this does this change us going forward our relations with them or do we just accept my based on oil and money that is that does it change it going forward I'm sorry to say that this does not change it now if if the CIA director had gone to Riyadh instead of Ankara I'd say okay we're in for a change but she went to Ankara because I think the CIA doesn't have all the facts and if she had gone to Riyadh I would have told you on this program she had gone there to tell the King it's time for Mohammed bin Salman to go that is not what happened today well that's scary yeah he doesn't have the facts then who would thank you for joining us thank you you
