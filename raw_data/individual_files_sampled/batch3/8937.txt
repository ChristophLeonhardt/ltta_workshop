STATEMENT? HOWIE: AND HIS LEAKS EARLIER. WE'LL TALK NEXT SEGMENT MORE ABOUT THIS. THE PRESIDENT COMES BACK FROM NORTH KOREA AND PUTS UP THIS TWEET AND REALLY HARSH WORD FROM THE MEDIA. SO FUNNY TO WATCH THE FAKE NEWS. THEY ARE FIGHTING HARD TO DOWN PLAY THE DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA. OUR COUNTRY'S BIGGEST ENEMY IS THE FAKE NEWS SO EASILY PROMULGATED BY FOOLS. WHEN HE SAYS BIGGEST ENEMY I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH. MOLLIE: HE SAID FAKE NEWS IS AN ENEMY. JUST SPEAKING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE TELLING ACCURATE FACTS. ON THIS I.G. REPORT WE HAD TWO MAJOR STORY LINES THAT HAVE BEEN IF YOU ARED THE LAST YEAR. ONE THAT IT WAS WRONG TO FIRE JAMES COMEY. THIS I.G. REPORT CONFIRMS EVERYTHING HE SAID ABOUT ROD ROSENSTEIN'S BAD DECISION MAKING AND FAILURE TO ADHERE TO AUTHORITY AND USURPATION AND THE LIKE. WE ARE TOLD YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CRITICIZE THE FBI. THEY ARE BEYOND REPROACH. AND THIS REPORT SHOWS THEY ARE NOT BEYOND REPROACH. CRITICIZING THE FBI AND CARING WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS IMPORTANT. HOWIE: BIGGEST ENEMY? MARIE: THE PRESIDENT USES FAKE NEWS TO GO AFTER MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS TO REPORT STORIES HE DOESN'T LIKE. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH FAKE NEWS. BUT TO LINK THE NORTH KOREA SUMMIT AND HIS FLOWERY TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT KIM JONG-UN IS, CALLING THE AMERICAN PRESS THE GREATEST ENEMY IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT SHOULD DISTURB EVERYONE ON THE RIGHT, ON THE LEFT AND IN THE CENTER. IT HAS CONSEQUENCES. HOWIE: I SEE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN FAKE NEWS AND BIGGEST ENEMY. SARA: YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS PART OF TRUMP'S PLAYBOOK. HE KNOWS THAT HELPS DRIVE THAT POPULIST MOVEMENT THAT GOT HIM ELECTED. IF HE CAN DIMINISH THE FAKE NEWS
