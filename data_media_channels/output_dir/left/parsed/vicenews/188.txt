hi my name is Lindsey Jordan and my
project is called snail mail pristine is
about allowing yourself to be hopelessly
in love and still being able to make fun
of it I knew I wanted to make guitar
driven record and Christine was the
first song that I wrote for it
there's like a different lead guitar
line on every first you wouldn't maybe
notice unlike first lesson divide
carries the melody of the song a song
that was really inspirational in the
studio was incinerate by Sonic Youth
I just really like the punchy
straightforward sounding guitar tone for
the bass parts I wanted to make sure
that they had some uh it serves more of
a purpose than doubling the guitar
but isn't over-the-top and distracting
cuz I always want the guitar to be the
main focus
the same part
it was like a genuine complaint about my
life at the time which was I would like
go to a party leave and then go to
Dunkin Donuts and then like stay there
all night but it's also kind of like a
profound statement about like the
monotony of life I think that the most
honest music comes from just wanting to
write songs as an outlet rather than
thinking about where those songs will go
or how people perceive them
