1
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:03,284
DECORUM AND A CIVIL DISCOURSE.

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:07,655
AND THAT'S THE ANGLE.

3
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:09,423
JOINING ME NOW IS DAN BONGINO,

4
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:10,658
FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT AND

5
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:12,693
AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK, SPYGATE.

6
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:14,895
ALSO JOINING ME AS ROCHELLE

7
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:15,896
RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS

8
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:17,998
SECRETARY FOR THE HOUSE

9
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,266
DEMOCRATS.

10
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:21,569
WHAT WILL THE DEMOCRATIC

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,972
RESPONSE BE IF SOMETHING

12
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:29,643
HORRIFIC HAPPENS, FOR BOTH

13
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,111
CONGRESSWOMEN AND SENATORS WHO

14
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:32,179
ARE EITHER TACITLY ENCOURAGING

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,080
OR ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING WITH

16
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,883
THEIR WORDS?

17
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:38,352
>> YOU MENTIONED THAT SOMEONE

18
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:41,889
MIGHT BE KILLED, AND SOMEONE

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,590
ALREADY HAS BEEN KILLED AS A

20
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:46,293
RESULT OF WHAT'S COMING FROM THE

21
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:47,895
RIGHT, WITCHES HAD THEIR HAIR.

22
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,863
THEIR HYPOCRISY WE ARE SEEING

23
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,131
COMING FROM REPUBLICANS IS

24
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:52,299
KILLING OBJECTIVE THINKING.

25
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,701
THE INABILITY OF THE G.O.P. TO

26
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:54,902
THINK OBJECTIVELY AND TO HOLD

27
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:56,270
THEMSELVES TO THE SAME ACCORD AS

28
00:00:56,271 --> 00:01:01,241
THEY HAVE HELD EVERYONE ELSE IS

29
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:01,976
LITERALLY LIKE A PLAGUE THAT IS

30
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:03,243
SPREADING THROUGHOUT OUR

31
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:04,778
POLITICS.

32
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:10,851
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORB

33
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:10,884
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORN

34
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:10,918
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORI

35
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:10,951
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORG

36
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:10,985
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORO

37
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:11,018
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORN

38
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:11,051
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORT

39
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:11,852
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORE

40
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:11,885
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORD

41
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:11,919
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORO

42
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,152
PEOPLE WERE BEGGING ON THE DOORS

43
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:13,487
OF THE SUPREME COURT AIMLESSLY,

44
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:15,322
AND IF WE THINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE

45
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:18,292
A MOB -- >> Laura: IS THAT --

46
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:19,893
IS THAT WHAT YOU ACTUALLY

47
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:24,064
CONSIDER TO BE CIVIL PROTEST, OR

48
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:26,200
WHAT WE SAW WITH ANTIFA IN

49
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:28,102
PORTLAND?

50
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:30,904
PREVENTING A CAR OR HARASSING AN

51
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,072
ELDERLY AMERICAN?

52
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:34,174
>> I DON'T CLAIM ANTIFA, AND

53
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:36,110
LIKE I JUST SAID A COUPLE

54
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:37,645
SECONDS AGO I THOUGHT BANGING ON

55
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:38,912
THE SUPREME COURT DOORS

56
00:01:38,913 --> 00:01:40,948
AIMLESSLY WAS A LITTLE

57
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:47,054
RIDICULOUS.

58
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:47,788
CONGRESSMAN CLEAVER WAS ACTUALLY

59
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,455
SPAT ON DURING THE TEA PARTY

60
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:49,123
MOVEMENT FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE

61
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:49,823
ANGRY ABOUT OBAMACARE.

62
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,893
SO THAT -- >> Laura: WHO WAS

63
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:54,261
ENCOURAGING THAT?

64
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:55,262
NO ONE WAS ENCOURAGING THAT.

65
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:57,498
NO REPUBLICANS THAT GET IN THEIR

66
00:01:57,499 --> 00:01:59,500
FACES, GO HARASS THEM AT A

67
00:01:59,501 --> 00:01:59,900
RESTAURANT.

68
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:02,569
DAN BONGINO, LET'S GET YOU IN ON

69
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,472
THIS.

70
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:05,973
GO AHEAD.

71
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:09,543
>> I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WHAT

72
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,310
RICHELLE JUST DID IS REALLY

73
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:11,745
GROSS AND I WANT TO CALL HER OUT

74
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:15,983
FOR THAT IMMEDIATELY.

75
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:17,718
WHAT HAPPENS -- I DIDN'T

76
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,519
INTERRUPT YOU, I'D APPRECIATE IT

77
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
IF YOU LET ME SPEAK.

78
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,089
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

79
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,658
AND WE ARE TRYING TO BE CIVIL.

80
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:25,693
>> NOW WE ARE.

81
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,661
>> WHAT YOU DID WAS GROTESQUE,

82
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:30,464
WHAT YOU DID WAS QUITE GROSS.

83
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:31,265
DONALD TRUMP AND CONSERVATIVES

84
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,700
TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

85
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:33,367
WITH THE DERANGED MURDERING

86
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:37,905
MANIAC WHO RUNS A WOMAN OVER IN

87
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:39,106
CHARLOTTESVILLE.

88
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:39,540
THAT IS GROSS.

89
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,741
PRESIDENT TRUMP DENOUNCED OUT

90
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,843
IMMEDIATELY AND YOU ARE BRINGING

91
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:44,611
IT UP IN THE CONTRACT -- >>

92
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:47,147
THERE IS GOOD AND BAD ON BOTH

93
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:48,482
SIDES.

94
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:51,618
>> JUST TAKE OVER THE DEBATE.

95
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,487
>> GO AHEAD.

96
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:55,055
>> I'M ALLOWED TO SPEAK NOW.

97
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:56,123
>> LET HIM SAY SOMETHING AND

98
00:02:56,124 --> 00:02:58,592
THEN YOU CAN RESPOND, ROCHELLE.

99
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,260
THAT WILL BE FINE.

100
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:01,762
>> YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE

101
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:03,797
QUESTION, YOU DISTRACTED BY

102
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:06,333
EVERYONE BY GOING TO

103
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,034
CHARLOTTESVILLE WHICH EVERYONE

104
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:07,901
DENOUNCED.

105
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:09,703
AND YET THEN YOU FABRICATED A

106
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:11,138
STORY THAT CLEAVER WAS SPIT ON.

107
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,072
HE WAS NOT SPIT ON, YOU ARE

108
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:14,975
MAKING THAT UP.

109
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:20,447
THESE ARE NONSENSE EVENTS.

110
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,915
YOU MADE IT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

111
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,617
OTHER THAN ANSWER THE QUESTION

112
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:26,286
WHICH FREQUENTLY LIBERALS DO.

113
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,956
>> I'M JUST GOING TO RESPOND BY

114
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:29,690
SAYING THIS.

115
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,291
FIRST OF ALL THAT STORY IS

116
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:34,661
COMPLETELY TRUE.

117
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:35,763
>> Laura: LET'S TRY TO KEEP

118
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38,899
IT -- WE HAVE LIMITED TIME SO

119
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,200
LET'S KEEP IT FOCUSED TO WHAT'S

120
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:40,768
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

121
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,002
I THINK WE ALL DO CARE ABOUT

122
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:45,706
WHAT KIDS TAKE AWAY FROM THIS.

123
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:47,441
WHETHER IT'S KIDS IN AN

124
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:48,575
IMMIGRATION VIDEO SAYING F THE

125
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:49,676
PRESIDENT AND PUTTING UP THEIR

126
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,678
MIDDLE FINGER OR, PEOPLE GOING

127
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,714
UP TO INDIVIDUALS WITH THEIR

128
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:54,681
CHILDREN, THEIR FAMILY,

129
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:55,482
OTHERWISE AND THEIR HUSBANDS IN

130
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:56,583
A RESTAURANT AND SCREAMING THEM

131
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:59,686
OUT OF A RESTAURANT.

132
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:00,921
IT IS INCUMBENT UPON BOTH

133
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:02,055
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO

134
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:03,624
STAND UP AND SAY, NO.

135
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,059
YOU WILL NOT DO THIS.

136
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,164
WHEN ERIC HOLDER IS OUT THERE

137
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:10,898
SAYING, WE WILL KICK THEM --

138
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:13,300
MICHELLE OBAMA ACTUALLY SAID,

139
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,602
WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE WILL GO

140
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:16,103
HIGH.

141
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:17,303
APPARENTLY ERIC HOLDER SAYS, WE

142
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:18,639
ARE JUST GOING TO KICK THEM OR

143
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,476
EVEN WORSE.

144
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,444
>> I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD

145
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:25,879
ASSAULT ANYONE BUT I ALSO THINK

146
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,381
THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER -- AND

147
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:28,382
IF PEOPLE GO BACK AND LOOK AT

148
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:30,651
WHAT ERIC HOLDER SAID, HE

149
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:33,821
FOLLOWED UP WITH THAT STATEMENT

150
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:36,190
SAYING WE SHOULD NOT DO ANYTHING

151
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:42,963
ILLEGAL OR INAPPROPRIATE.

152
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,465
>> Laura: SO GOING BACK TO THE

153
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,167
YOUNG PEOPLE THAT CONSUME MEDIA,

154
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:51,505
WHAT WILL THEY BE CONSUMING?

155
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:53,907
>> WE JUST CAN'T SIMPLY ADMIT

156
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,242
THAT PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES AND

157
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:56,844
SAY REALLY DUMB THINGS.

158
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:59,413
NOW ERIC HOLDER WAS TALKING

159
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:00,280
ABOUT KICKING THEM OUT OF THE

160
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,783
HOUSE AND THAT IS NOT WHAT HE

161
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:07,087
SAID.

162
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:14,228
>>    >> Laura: THIS IS FROM

163
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,497
RAND PAUL'S WIFE, KELLY.

164
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:18,298
SHE SAID THIS BACK ON

165
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:19,433
OCTOBER 8TH JUST A COUPLE OF

166
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:22,502
DAYS AGO.

167
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:25,305
>> THERE ARE SO MANY FRANKLY

168
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:26,573
UNHINGED PEOPLE AND UNSTABLE

169
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:28,709
PEOPLE OUT THERE, AND WHEN THEY

170
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,776
HEAR SOMEONE ON THEIR SIDE

171
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:33,313
TELLING THEM, GET UP IN YOUR

172
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:35,315
FACE, THEY TAKE THAT LITERALLY.

173
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:36,316
BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE THAT

174
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:37,918
RAND HAS EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST

175
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,088
YEAR, IT DOES SCARE ME THAT

176
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,789
LARRY WILL BE SOMEBODY REALLY

177
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,258
UNSTABLE THAT TAKES THAT MESSAGE

178
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,125
A STEP FURTHER.

179
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,927
WE'VE UPDATED ALL OF OUR

180
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,528
SECURITY SYSTEMS AT HOME.

181
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:51,732
I SLEEP WITH A LOADED GUN BY MY

182
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,267
BED.

183
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:55,302
>> DAN, FINAL THOUGHTS?

184
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:57,304
>> HE WAS ATTACKED AND HAD

185
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:58,305
BROKEN RIBS, HE'S APPARENTLY

186
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:00,173
COMING COMING DOWN WITH FREQUENT

187
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:04,311
CASES OF PNEUMONIA NOW.

188
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:06,914
