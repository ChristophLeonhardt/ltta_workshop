1
00:00:00,307 --> 00:00:03,057
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,073
(thunder rumbles)

3
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,620
- Hurricane Maria hit us hard.

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,130
Our solar panels and house survived,

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,400
but the whole system collapsed.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,650
I needed cash, but the banks were closed,

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,475
and credit cards were just plastic.

8
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:34,520
(bright music)

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,100
A friend in Missouri told me,

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,690
"Why don't I send you money
through Western Union?"

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,660
Shortly after the devastation
from Hurricane Maria,

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,059
Western Union sent a plane
of cash to Puerto Rico.

13
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:45,892
Gracias.

14
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:48,283
Now I could begin helping my neighbors.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,560
There will be other other storms,

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:00,000
but we'll be ready to
weather them, together.
