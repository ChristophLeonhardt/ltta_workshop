after Terry Crews slams Russell Simmons on Twitter after Russell Simmons sends him an email asking him to sort of take it easy on the agent Adam Bennett who Terry Crews has accused of groping him at a party so in the email that he posted to his Twitter it's from Russell Simmons with just the subject line agent reading did he ever apologize give the agent a pass ask that he be reinstated with great love all things are possible Terry Crews then tweeted message Russell Simmons sent me regarding my sexual assault case against Adam Bennett of WME deer at uncle rush no one gets a pass in all caps and what I think is interesting I found this quote with regards to the emotional intelligence that Terry Crews displayed saying quote the email Simmons purportedly sent Cruz's more evidence of the dark side by asking Cruz to quote give the age and a pass it sends the message that a weak apology is sufficient to alleviate any severe emotional pain and suffering experienced by the victim it also implies that excusing this type of behavior is somehow taking the high road but that couldn't be further from the truth that message has since become complicated by new and disturbing allegations against Simmons himself which you can check out our discussion of that in another TYT video now just to give you guys up to date context on what's going on variety report on November 3rd that mr. Bennett was on leave as the agency looked into the actors accusations but mr. Cruz had not publicly identified mr. Bennett until Wednesday mr. Cruz who had been represented by WME but not by mr. Bennett personally left the agency last week mr. Bennett represented some of Hollywood's most well known actors including Emma Stone Adam Sandler Sylvester Stallone Michael B Jordan Dustin Hoffman and Eddie Murphy so what was your reaction when you saw Terry Crews taking this email private email correspondence to Twitter I personally thought this was incredibly like bold and awesome for calling him out no one gets the pass yeah I'm not sure I thought it was awesome and I'll tell you a couple of distinctions here so so first off of course it shouldn't matter between male and female victims but I think what it is is that there's little different standards between male and female but thick skin versus thin skin and I'm not saying that disparage people who have thin skin I'm just saying that people have different reactions you know as I was reading this story because the guy grabbed him from the front okay we've covered stories in the past year where a couple of guys here have been grabbed from the from the back and I remember I you know I told the story and one of our post games for the member is about the Cuban guy who grabbed me in the middle of a meal a and Elian Gonzalez and I was amused by it I didn't care a couple other guys here have been grabbed and then I realized as it was reading tarik whistling I remember someone once grabbed me from the front but I cared so little about it then I don't remember who it was and I just thought it was kind of weird but like he had done it jokingly or something and I was like wow that's super weird and I moved on with my life so I tell you that exactly got thick skin and so if someone says hey shank maybe let it go I would take that as a private correspondence and his opinion that I should and I wouldn't be intimidated by it if I didn't want to let it go and tell him to piss off right because I have the benefit of having the privilege of being secure and confident and in a decent place in my life in my career where I could make those decisions and I'm not intimidated by anybody but I actually think that it you know and and well that like saying that it's so like moving on I'm saying they should be left up to the victim and Terry Crews doesn't want to move on so there's nothing wrong with that at all but if someone did want to move on that's I also think there's nothing wrong with that right but it's not Russell Simmons place to then come say hey look give it give this guy a pass did he apologize asked that he be reinstated you know Terry Crews said that he felt the most emasculated in his life by the groping incident that Adam Bennett the by what happened and transpired by him and Adam Bennett and Adam edits subsequent response was just laughing in his face i I just I think that it was wildly inappropriate for Russell Simmons to insert himself into this because how you feel when you have been groped is totally different and you can't sort of project that onto how other people should feel that's my point I just want to be clear about that that's actually my point which is that you have to remember that not everybody thinks like you do because just because I'm thick-skinned doesn't mean everybody else is thick-skinned and it's still it's still a fireable offense it's a wildly awful inappropriate behavior by Adam Bennett to someone that is at his agency at a party with his wife there so he yeah he should you shouldn't be given a pass that's bad don't do that you sorry you struck out Bennett I was ragging in mind around this like sexual harassment thing and the sexual harassment I talked to it you know someone in law enforcement and they said that there's a lot that goes into it of course but one is did their their working relationship and then where it happened and then a bunch of other things but the working relationship has the most effect on it so in this situation what was the working relationship between Terry Crews and Adam Bennett was it his agent not his agent but so so then it's just some guy at that point and we're all loosely related in the production process but it wasn't at a meeting it wasn't in anything like that I I think the the thought that I can't talk Terry Crews what to do or think if it was me I've been in situations where like I knew that someone was acting inappropriately and I was like I can handle this that's not a big problem for me my priority would be like I want to help the discussion the discussion would probably be bad in my opinion would be best served by kind of a 10,000 foot view since Terry Crews is so accomplished unless this was a serial offender who has offended a lot of people it would be nice to have the discussion definitely prime if a name is dropped it's the name of Adam venoth the person who did it to bring Russell Simmons into it seems like a little outside another qualifying factor would be like what's the relationship between Terry Crews and Russell Simmons yes they're really close friends and you're and you've had a good relationship and my friend sends me this email especially with no punctuation I would think it's it sounds like a friend's email sort of because there's no punctuation but then with like this weird like I'm gonna gag with great love all things are possible he writes that all the time right I will also say but it's so connected I don't that's the one of those things like if I like Russell Simmons you're right with great love all things are possible but if the you know someone's been pulling on you know if you want to you know destroy a sweater and you just pull the string as he walks away like then he is now an evil person and I hate him because he says things like with great love all things are possible I found peace because I have two daughters now yeah another time okay so again let's be clear here in context matters yeah no one thinks that would Adam Bennett did to Terry Crews is okay nobody fixed that right so now it earlier I said I think skin if somebody had done it to me I don't encourage it and don't do that and and I might have a different opinion you know later if it if it happened to me but I'm saying that that's up to Terry Cruz's decided he was not okay with it so at a minute should never have done that that's obvious that's clear that that part is easy I think the harder part is the Russell Simmons part where it's a private correspondence and Terry Crews is putting it out there that sort of context matters a lot because if if Terry doesn't know Russell at all and Russell's all of a sudden like and Russell knows Adam Bennett and they have business together and he writes in like hey be cool but that's a different thing right on the other hand if Russell Simmons and Terry Crews know each other well and then I like if I know two guys and I step into the middle not having even do with work right and I'd be like hey guys you sure you can't work this out all of a sudden I'm a bad guy and somebody's gonna send that email out do you see what I'm saying right but what I would be what I would say back is then it sounds like he's just showing off me like hello Russell Simmons is in the room and I produce a lot of stuff and I'm saying I asked a question but regardless of the answer I say did he give it did he have ever apologized then write in to give the age in a pass ask that he be reinstated like if I care a lot I don't know I'm not Russell Simmons obviously and not Russell Simmons but you know like write more words write a thoughtful emails oppose like three things one of which is a question you don't wait for the answer for the next two are directives on how to give this get this guy a pass why this sort of resonated with me is that you know Russell Simmons is incredibly powerful in so many industries and I look at this as Terry Crews sort of speaking truth to power and calling this out especially when we think about Tara Russell Simmons relationship to Brett Ratner who had you know and his history of sexual abuse I wonder how Russell Simmons has thought of those I like all give him a pass did he apologize I understand why Terry Crews chose Russell Simmons to call out like we cannot give sexual predators a pass III understand that connection and I think that you know Twitter is just is the is the forum that everyone our world leaders are using to announce policy and if this is going to be the new policy in Hollywood I understand why Terry Crews chose the that platform qit membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded stream it podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent
