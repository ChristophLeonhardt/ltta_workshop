last week I went to see Andrew Lawrence live in London Lawrence is a comedian who used to be pretty huge on the circuit he was on live at the Apollo Mock the Week and all the standard BBC comedy shows that usually feature sickeningly left-wing so-called comedians who can't help but take easy punches about working-class people breaks it and anti-immigration sentiments but Lawrence was different you may remember a few years ago when he snapped and called out these low-lives on Facebook in his Facebook post he said that he can't help but notice increasingly a lot of political comedians cracking cheap and easy gangs about you Kip to the extent that it's got hack boring and lazy very quickly he went on to say that there is a deeply ingrained militant liberal politics at every level of the BBC despite the fact that it's taxpayer-funded and supposed to be neutral it's a biased organisation and the only sorts of political comedians that are welcome within his corridors are those that reflect its values and for all those that claim he's wrong about the BBC how then do they explain the fact that ever since his public condemnation of the cheap shots made at you Kip and his explanation of how he understands why people voted you Kip meant that he never appeared on the BBC ever again in fact Lawrence has been totally outcast from the TV camp comedy community I was honored to see him perform in Leicester Square but what I saw in stage was a man who was keeping his head above the ground barely bravely taking on political correctness and saying things that no other comedian would dare say I also saw a man who was seriously troubled and damaged by the nasty mean-spirited venomous nature of the political left who he has been for years surrounded by his jokes about being kicked off the TV doing gigs gigs in back rooms of pubs and never quite filling a room made me really respect the guy actually he's still making people laugh he's still following his passion and he won't kowtow to the bat rat she received from his co-workers and from the perpetually offended all over the country many of whom actually turned up to his gigs only to make a scene and walk out halfway through but the very fact that simply continuing his career is some form of rebellion tells us we've got a serious problem with a vocal political minority in this country now I've got a sim experience to this I was kicked out at the University of Liverpool you can read all about it in my book a paradoxical alliance sorry shameless plug there but in it you'll read about how I was targeted by politically motivated lecturers who lied about me and ignored threats to hurt and kill me along with physical intimidation inflicted against me on campus I remember walking through campus when one man whispered in my ear that he would shoot me if I step foot near Toxteth in Liverpool an older man spat on me shortly afterwards but despite being a student of politics the University claimed that my values didn't reflect theirs and that I therefore could no longer study there this was pretty much unheard of back then only about six years ago actually but now it's way more common student unions just like they were some decades ago with Labour's militant wing there now hell-bent on ensuring that nobody with opposing views dare set foot in their schools and the lecturers are on their side the left whether it's in academia or entertainment or in fact any area of life really will do everything they can to ensure that anyone who dares talk about immigration or culture is shunned from normal life they don't want them to have a career they don't want them in university and they don't even want them to have children remember the story of the couple who had their foster children taken away from them by the local council just for being members of you Kip that happened well how about the time that the Nobel Prize winner Tim hunt an important biochemist from UCL was forced to step down after cracking a joke about women or even Bev who rebel media met last year the woman who was fired from her work for supporting anne-marie Watters I mean we live in a democracy there is no grounds for firing anybody for having a political opinion anyone involved in conservative British politics will know what it's like trying to hold down any sort of a job if you're in a business the left will use their army of online crybabies to leave bad reviews from clients and intimidate them into leaving and damaging your reputation forever if you work for a business they'll phone your boss and tell them that you're in at sea for years before I join the team at rebel the left obsessively attempted to find out a where I lived and be where I worked well they know now my boss is a little advanced so go on give them a call tell Ezra I'm a racist but if the rest find out where you live they might put bricks through your window they might put notices around your neighborhood informing your neighbors that they live close to a Nazi they might even put you on an online map and while this is all bad enough that people on the right in Britain have to keep their homes and Families secret and pray that they stay out of antepers crosshairs when it comes to their job the real intention of these people seems extremely sinister to me even more sinister if their intention is to scare us out of our homes make us lose business publicly defame us and get our bosses to fire us then ultimately what is it they want us to do it's not like their intention is to stop people like us from just holding positions of power they don't want us working at all so what exactly we meant to do let's let's play this through shall we but I don't want as entertaining people they don't want us working in an office like Bev they don't like us representing the voters like Gerard batten who got a brick through his window they don't want us in education unless we're willing to be brainwashed they don't want us running businesses so what does that leave us in council properties on benefits but we struggle as of April 2016 there are almost 1.2 million households on the council house waiting lists think God knows how many homeless he'll never get a chance to get back on the property rather or even have somewhere warm to sleep and the closer you get to London the worse it gets and can you imagine in any utopia run by these Marxist lunatics that any of us would ever reach the top of that council waiting lists what with hundreds of thousands of new people arriving in the UK every year these people would never want people like us living off the state's why would they want government money funding racists I'm confident that when they say they want us out of work and out of Education what they really mean is they want us on the streets and ask yourself this if Andrew Lawrence found himself homeless out of work after being shunned by the left-wing comedy community and ignored by a left-wing audience would a member of auntie fur buy him a sandwich or spare him any change or would they walk past and spit on him I think it's time we faced up to the reality that many of these people who hound and harass anyone who dares challenged their Dogma may even want to see us dead you
