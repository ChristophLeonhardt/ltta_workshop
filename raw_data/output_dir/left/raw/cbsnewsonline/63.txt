PRESIDENT SENT A VERY 

189
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,734
THOUGHTFUL INVITATION. STUDENTS 

190
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,771
MADE A SPIFFY VIDEO. AND WHEN I 

191
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:55,241
DECLINED, I HEAR THERE WAS 

192
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,209
SPECULATION THAT I WAS 

193
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,210

194
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,313

THAT LATE NIGHT FOOD DEBATE. 

198
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,692
THE TRUTH IS, AFTER 8 YEARS IN 

199
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,127
THE WHITE HOUSE I NEEDED TO 

200
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,595

AND SHE SAYS HELLO, BY THE WAY. 

204
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,940
I ALSO WANTED TO SPEND SOME 

205
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,941
QUALITY TIME WITH MY DAUGHTERS 

206
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,677
WHO WERE SUDDENLY YOUNG WOMEN 

207
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:37,082
ON THEIR WAY OUT THE DOOR. 

208
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:38,384
AND I SHOULD ADD BY THE WAY, 

209
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,719

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,919

WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU. 

218
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:09,181
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING. 

219
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,383
AND THE TRUTH WAS, I WAS ALSO 

220
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,517
INTENT ON FOLLOWING A WISE 

221
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,453
AMERICAN TRADITION OF EX-

PRESIDENTS GRACEFULLY EXITING 

223
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,693
THE POLITICAL STAGE AND MAKING 

224
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,195
ROOM FOR NEW VOICES AND NEW 

225
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,163
IDEAS. 

226
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,499
AND WE HAVE OUR FIRST 

227
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,866
PRESIDENT, GEORGE WASHINGTON TO 

228
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:34,473
THINK FOR SETTING THAT -- THANK 

229
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,143
FOR SETTING THAT EXAMPLE. 

230
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,410
THERE WERE NO CONSTRAINTS 

231
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,178
REALLY. 

232
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,081
HE WAS PRACTICALLY A GOD TO 

233
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,749
THOSE WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO 

234
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,917
BATTLE. 

235
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,751
THERE WAS NO CONSTITUTION. 

236
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,988
THERE WERE NO DEMOCRATIC NORMS 

237
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,756
THAT GUIDED WHAT YOU SHOULD OR 

238
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,659
COULD DO. 

239
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,294
AND HE COULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF 

240
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:55,627
ALL-POWERFUL. 

241
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:56,762
HE COULD'VE MADE HIMSELF 

242
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,400
POTENTIALLY PRESIDENT FOR LIFE. 

243
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,468
INSTEAD, HE RESIGNED AS 

244
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,869
COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND MOVED 

245
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,907
BACK TO HIS COUNTRY ESTATE. 

246
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,975
6 YEARS LATER, HE WAS ELECTED 

247
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:12,344
PRESIDENT. 

248
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,313
BUT AFTER TWO TERMS, HE 

249
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,716
RESIGNED AGAIN. 

250
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,584
HE WENT OFF INTO THE SUNSET. 

251
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,989
THE POINT WASHINGTON MADE, THE 

252
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,257
POINT THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO 

253
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,160
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS THAT IN A 

254
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,398
GOVERNMENT OF AND BY AND FOR 

255
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,100
THE PEOPLE, THERE SHOULD BE NO 

256
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,338
PERMANENT RULING CLASS. 

257
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:44,777
THEY ARE ONLY CITIZENS WHO ARE 

258
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,479
TEMPORARY REPRESENTATIVES AND 

259
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,148
DETERMINE OUR COURSE AND 

260
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,250
DETERMINE OUR CHARACTER. 

261
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,421
I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE THIS IS 

262
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,422
ONE OF THOSE PIVOTAL MOMENTS 

263
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,793
ONE EVERYONE OF US, AS CITIZENS 

264
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,062
OF THE UNITED STATES NEED TO 

265
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,033
DETERMINE JUST WHO IT IS THAT 

266
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:07,266
WE ARE. 

267
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,269
JUST WHAT IT IS THAT WE STAND 

268
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,071
FOR. 

269
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,041
AND AS A FELLOW CITIZEN, NOT AS 

270
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,178
AN EX-PRESIDENT BUT AS A 

271
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,279
CITIZEN, I'M HERE TO DELIVER 

272
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,014
SIMPLE MESSAGE AND THAT IS THAT 

273
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,450
YOU NEED TO VOTE BECAUSE 

274
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,284
DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON IT. 

275
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,485
[ APPLAUSE ] 

276
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,366
NOW, SOME OF YOU MAY THINK I AM 

277
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,300
EXAGGERATING WHEN I SAY THIS 

278
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,334
ELECTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 

279
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:47,606
ANY I CAN REMEMBER IN MY 

280
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:47,873
LIFETIME. 

281
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,375
I KNOW POLITICIANS SAY THAT ALL 

282
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,843
THE TIME. 

283
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,678
I HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SING IT A 

284
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,612
FEW TIMES, PARTICULARLY WHEN I 

285
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,313
WAS ON THE BALLOT. 

286
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:59,585
[ LAUGHTER ] BUT JUST A GLANCE 

287
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,288
AT RECENT HEADLINES SHOULD TELL 

288
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,089
YOU THAT THIS MOMENT REALLY IS 

289
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:07,193
DIFFERENT. 

290
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,095
THE STAKES REALLY ARE HIGHER. 

291
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,598
THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY OF US 

292
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,001
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES ARE 

293
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,038
MORE DIRE. 

294
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,141
AND IT ISN'T AS IF WE HAVEN'T 

295
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,575
HAD BIG ELECTIONS BEFORE OR BIG 

296
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,412
CHOICES TO MAKE IN OUR HISTORY. 

297
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,548
THE FACT IS, DEMOCRACY HAS 

298
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,083
NEVER BEEN EASY AND FOUNDING 

299
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,620
FATHERS ARGUED ABOUT EVERYTHING.

300
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,959
WE WAGED A CIVIL WAR. WE 

301
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,895
OVERCAME DEPRESSION. WE HAVE 

302
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,265
LURCHED FROM ARROWS OF GREAT 

303
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,301
AGGRESSIVE CHANGE TO PERIODS OF 

304

RETRENCHMENT.

STILL, MOST AMERICANS ALIVE 

306
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:58,244
TODAY, CERTAINLY THE STUDENTS 

307
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:04,383
WERE HERE, HAVE OPERATED UNDER 

308
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,384
SOME COMMON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT 

309
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:10,489
WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND 

310
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:10,990
FOR. 

311
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,724
OUT OF THE TURMOIL OF THE 

312
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:15,360
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THE 

313
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,030
GREAT DEPRESSION, AMERICAN -- 

314
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,967
AMERICA ADOPTED A NEW ECONOMY.

AND ALL OF THIS LED TO 

325
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,567
UNRIVALED PROSPERITY. 

326
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,703
AND THE RISE OF A BROAD AND 

327
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,272
DEEP MIDDLE-CLASS. 

328
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,473
IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU WORKED 

329
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,043
HARD, YOU COULD CLIMB THE LADDER

330
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:11,016
OF SUCCESS. 

331
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,151
NOW NOT EVERYBODY WAS INCLUDED 

332
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,051
IN THIS PROSPERITY. 

333
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,987
THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. 

334
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,655
END ZONE RESPONSE TO THE STAIN 

335
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:21,160
OF SLAVERY, AND SEGREGATION, 

336
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,994
AND THE REALITY OF RACIAL 

337
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,162
DISCRIMINATION, THE CIVIL 

338
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,998

NEW DOORS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS 

340

BUT ALSO OPENED UP THE

AND ALTHOUGH DISCRIMINATION 

348
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,658
REMAINED A PERNICIOUS FORCE IN

EVERYBODY IS TREATED FAIRLY.

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,993
WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED ON YOUR 

361
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,129

00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,556
AND TO HELP POOR COUNTRIES 

372
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:03,529
DEVELOP. AND AMERICAN 

373
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,930
LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE GLOBE 

374
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,398
WASN'T PERFECT. 

375
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,335
WE MADE MISTAKES AT TIMES, WE 

376
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,905
LOST SIGHT OF IDEALS. WE HAD 

377
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,641
FIERCE ARGUMENTS ABOUT VIETNAM 

378
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,578
AND FIERCE ARGUMENTS ABOUT IRAQ.

379
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,047
BUT THANKS TO LEADERSHIP, A 

380
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:24,850
BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP, AND THE 

381
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,887
EFFORTS OF DIPLOMATS, AND PEACE 

382
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:34,226
CORPS VOLUNTEERS, AND MOST ALL 

383
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,994
THE SACRIFICES OF THE MEN AND 

384
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,062
WOMEN IN UNIFORM, RE-REDUCED 

385
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:39,098
THE PROSPECTS OF FOUR BETWEEN 

386
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,334
THE GREAT POWERS -- WAR BETWEEN 

387
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,103
THE GREAT POWERS, WE WON THE 

388
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,771
COLD WAR, WE HELPED SPREAD A 

389
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:49,007
COMMITMENT TO CERTAIN VALUES 

390
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,875
AND PRINCIPLES LIKE THE RULE OF 

391
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,213
LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND 

392
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:54,513
DEMOCRACY. 

393
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,518
AND THE NOTION OF THE INHERENT 

394
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,886
DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY 

395
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,490
INDIVIDUAL. AND EVEN THOSE 

396
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,059
COUNTRIES THAT DIDN'T ABIDE BY 

397
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,962
THOSE PRINCIPLES, WERE STILL 

398
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:14,833
SUBJECT TO SHAME AND STILL HAD 

399
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,435
TO AT LEAST GIVE LIP SERVICE TO 

400
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:20,105
THE IDEA. AND THAT PROVIDED A 

401
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,942
LEVER TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE 

402
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,678
THE PROSPECTS FOR PEOPLE AROUND 

403
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:30,582
THE WORLD. 

404
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:35,654
THAT'S THE STORY OF AMERICA. 

405
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:40,492
A STORY OF PROGRESS, FITFUL 

406
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,463
PROGRESS, INCOMPLETE PROGRESS, 

407
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,532
BUT PROGRESS. 

408
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,900
AND THAT PROGRESS WASN'T 

409
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,768
ACHIEVED BY JUST A HANDFUL OF 

410
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:54,006
FAMOUS LEADERS MAKING SPEECHES. 

411
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,709
IT WAS WON BECAUSE OF COUNTLESS 

412
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,510
QUIET ACTS OF HEROISM AND 

413
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:04,750
DEDICATION, BY CITIZENS, BY 

414
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,952
ORDINARY PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM 

415
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:13,125
NOT MUCH OLDER THAN YOU. 

416
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,828
IT WAS WON BECAUSE RATHER THAN 

417
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,262
BE BYSTANDERS TO HISTORY, 

418
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,430
ORDINARY PEOPLE THOUGHT AND 

419
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:26,138
MARCHED AND MOBILIZED AND BUILT 

420
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:34,313
AND, YES, VOTED TO MAKE HISTORY.

421
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,782
OF COURSE, THERE IS ALWAYS 

422
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:43,255
ANOTHER DARKER ASPECT TO 

423
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,458
AMERICA'S STORY. 

424
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,060
PROGRESS DOESN'T JUST MOVE IN A 

425
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,427
STRAIGHT LINE. 

426
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,128
THERE IS A REASON WHY PROGRESS 

427
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,030
HASN'T BEEN EASY. 

428
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,733
AND WHY THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY, 

429
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,737
EVERY TWO STEPS FORWARD, SEEMS 

430
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,105
TO SOMETIMESPRODUCE ONE STEP 

431
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,040
BACK. 

432
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,310
EACH TIME WE PULL OURSELVES 

433
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,915
CLOSER TO OUR FOUNDING IDEAS, 

434
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,483
THAT ALL OF US ARE CREATED 

435
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,486
EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THE CREATOR 

436
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:20,225
WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS, THE IDEALS 

437
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,161
THAT SAY EVERY CHILD SHOULD 

438
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,997
HAVE OPPORTUNITY, AND EVERY MAN 

439
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,498
AND WOMAN WHO IS WILLING TO 

440
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,900
WORK HARD SHOULD BE ABLE TO 

441
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,837
FIND A JOB AND SUPPORT THEIR 

442
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,538
FAMILY AND HAVE A SMALL PIECE 

443
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,207
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, THE 

444
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,808
IDEALS THAT SAY WE HAVE A 

445
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,143
COLLECTIVE RESPONSE ABILITY TO 

446
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,879
CARE FOR THE SICK, AND WE HAVE 

447
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,481
A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONSERVE 

448
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,850
THE AMAZING BOUNTY, THE NATURAL 

449
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,320
RESOURCES OF THIS COUNTRY, AND 

450
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,589
OF THIS PLANET. 

451
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,257
EACH TIME WE'VE GOTTEN CLOSER 

452
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:56,228
TO THOSE IDEALS, SOMEBODY 

453
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:00,332
SOMEWHERE HAS PUSHED BACK. 

454
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:06,038
THE STATUS QUO PUSHES BACK. 

455
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,807
SOMETIMES THE BACKLASH COMES 

456
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,177
FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE GENUINELY, 

457
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,580
IF WRONGLY, FEARFUL OF CHANGE. 

458
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,651
MORE OFTEN IT IS MANUFACTURED 

459
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,319
BY THE POWERFUL AND THE 

460
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,556
PRIVILEGED WHO WANT TO KEEP US 

461
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,391
DIVIDED AND KEEP US ANGRY AND 

462
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,360
KEEP US CYNICAL BECAUSE THAT 

463
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,963
HELPS THEM MAINTAIN THE STATUS 

464
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:31,263
QUO. 

465
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,398
AND KEEP THEIR POWER. 

466
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:38,770
AND KEEP THEIR PRIVILEGE. 

467
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,505
AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE COMING-OF-

468
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:46,078
AGE DURING ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS.

469
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,812
IT DID NOT START WITH DONALD 

470
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,548
TRUMP. 

471
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,384
HE IS A SYMPTOM, NOT THE CAUSE. 

472
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:59,091
[ APPLAUSE ] 

473
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:05,764
HE IS JUST CAPITALIZING ON 

474
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,733
RESENTMENTS THAT POLITICIANS 

475
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,801
HAVE BEEN PENDING FOR YEARS. 

476
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:14,840
A FEAR AND ANGER THAT IS ROOTED 

477
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,174
IN THE PAST BUT ALSO BORN OUT 

478
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,776
OF THE ENORMOUS OF PEOPLE'S 

479
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,579
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE -- 

480
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,447
UPHEAVALS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE 

481
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,116
IN YOUR BRIEF LIFETIMES. 

482
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:29,855
BY THE TIME -- BY THE WAY, IT 

483
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,155
WAS BRIEF. 

484
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,690
WHEN I HEARD THAT MARK D'AMICO  

485
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,025
WAS 11 WHEN I WAS ELECTED. 

486
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:35,460
AND NOW HE IS STARTING A 

487
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,228
COMPANY. 

488
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,930
THAT WAS YESTERDAY. 

489
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,367
[ LAUGHTER ] BUT THINK ABOUT IT,

490
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,169
YOU HAVE COME OF AGE IN A 

491
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,206
SMALLER, MORE CONNECTED WORLD 

492
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,109
WHERE DEMOCRATIC SHIFTS HAVE 

493
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:55,914
SCRAMBLED NOT ONLY TRADITIONAL 

494
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,418
ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENTS BUT OUR 

495
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,186
SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AND OUR 

496
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:06,892
RELIGIOUS COMMITMENTS AND OUR 

497
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,695
CIVIC INSTITUTIONS. 

498
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,563
MOST OF YOU DON'T REMEMBER A 

499
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,932
TIME BEFORE 9/11. 

500
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,066
WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE A 

501
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,902
FEW SHOWS AT AN AIRPORT. 

502
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:21,139
-- SHOES AT AN AIRPORT. 

503
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,474
MOST OF YOU DON'T REMEMBER A 

504
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,608
TIME WHEN AMERICA WASN'T AT 

505
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,543
WAR. 

506
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,211
OR WHEN MONEY AND IMAGES AND 

507
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,413
INFORMATION TO TRAVEL INSTANTLY 

508
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,450
AROUND THE GLOBE. 

509
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,887
OR WHEN THE CLIMATE WASN'T 

510
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:36,588
CHANGING FASTER THAN OUR 

511
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:44,296
EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IT. 

512
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,330
THIS CHANGE HAS HAPPENED FAST. 

513
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,798
FASTER THAN ANY TIME IN HUMAN 

514
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:47,766
HISTORY. 

515
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,103
AND IT CREATED A NEW ECONOMY 

516
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,403
THAT HAS UNLEASHED INCREDIBLE 

517
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:56,341
PROSPERITY BUT IT HAS ALSO 

518
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:00,946
UPENDED LIVES IN PROFOUND WAYS. 

519
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,815
FOR THOSE WITH UNIQUE SKILLS, 

520
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,049
OR ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND 

521
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,485
CAPITAL, A GLOBAL MARKET HAS 

522
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:12,123
MEANT UNPRECEDENTED WEALTH. 

523
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:16,561
FOR THOSE NOT SO LUCKY, FOR THE 

524
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,497
FACTORY WORKER, THE OFFICE 

525
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,901
WORKER, OR EVEN MIDDLE MANAGERS,

526
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,536
THOSE SAME FORCES MAY HAVE 

527
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,973
WIPED YOUR JOB OR AT LEAST PUT 

528
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,775
YOU IN NOW POSITION TO ASK FOR 

529
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,177
A RAISE. 

530
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,313
AND AS WAGES SLOWED AND 

531
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,014
INEQUALITY ACCELERATED, THOSE 

532
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,917
AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID HAVE 

533
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,385
INFLUENCED GOVERNMENT TO SKEW 

534
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,254
THINGS EVEN MORE IN THEIR 

535
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,990
DIRECTION. 

536
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,260
CUTTING TAXES ON THE WEALTHIEST 

537
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,097
AMERICANS, ON WIDENING 

538
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,132
REGULATIONS AND WEAKENING 

539
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:54,499
PROTECTIONS. 

540
00:23:54,499 --> 00:24:01,439
SHRINKING THE SAFETY NET. 

541
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,309
SO, YOU HAVE COME OF AGE DURING 

542
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:11,683
A TIME OF GROWING INEQUALITY, 

543
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,186
FRACTURING OF ECONOMIC 

544
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:14,719
OPPORTUNITY. 

545
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:18,623
AND THAT GROWING ECONOMIC DIVIDE

546
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,392
COMPOUNDED OTHER DIVISIONS IN 

547
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,060
THE COUNTRY. 

548
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,162
REGIONAL, RACIAL, RELIGIOUS, 

549
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:28,500
CULTURAL. IT MADE IT HARDER TO 

550
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,969
BUILD CONSENSUS ON ISSUES. 

551
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,472
IT MADE POLITICIANS LESS 

552
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,840
WILLING TO COMPROMISE. 

553
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,442
WHICH INCREASED GRIDLOCK, WHICH 

554
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,844
MADE PEOPLE EVEN MORE CYNICAL 

555
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:45,116
ABOUT POLITICS. AND THEN THE 

556
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,517
RECKLESS BEHAVIOR OF FINANCIAL 

557
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:50,388
ELITES TRIGGERED A MASSIVE 

558
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,223
FINANCIAL CRISIS. 10 YEARS AGO 

559
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:55,927
THIS WEEK, A CRISIS THAT 

560
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:56,561
RESULTED IN THE WORST RECESSION 

561
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,196
IN ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES AND 

562
00:24:59,196 --> 00:25:01,766
CAUSED YEARS OF HARDSHIP FOR 

563
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,904
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

564
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,305
FOR MANY OF YOUR PARENTS, FOR 

565
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:11,109
MANY OF YOUR FAMILIES -- MOST 

566
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,611
OF YOU WEREN'T OLD ENOUGH TO 

567
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:16,247
FULLY FOCUS ON WHAT WAS GOING 

568
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:18,083
ON AT THE TIME. 

569
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,219
BUT WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE IN 

570
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,188
2009, WE WERE LOSING 800,000 

571
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,191
JOBS A MONTH. 

572
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:26,725
800,000. 

573
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,526
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE LOSING 

574
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,962
HOMES. 

575
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,197
MANY WERE WORRIED WE WERE 

576
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,364
ENTERING INTO A SECOND GREAT 

577
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:36,768
DEPRESSION. 

578
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,639
SO WE WORKED HARD TO END THAT 

579
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,174
CRISIS BUT ALSO TO BREAK SOME 

580
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,811
OF THESE LONGER TERM TRENDS. 

581
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,379
THE ACTIONS WE TOOK DURING THAT 

582
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:51,615
CRAISINS -- CRISIS RETURN TO 

583
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:55,253
GROWTH. 

584
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,254
IT INITIATED THE LONGEST STREAK 

585
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:57,188
OF JOB CREATION ON RECORD. 

586
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,522
AND WE COVERED ANOTHER 20 

587
00:25:58,522 --> 00:26:00,692
MILLION AMERICANS WITH HEALTH 

588
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,760
INSURANCE AND CUT DEFICITS BY 

589
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,096
MORE THAN HALF IMMEDIATELY BY 

590
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,231
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME 

591
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,232
WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN SUCH 

592
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,500
AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES I THIS 

593
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,302
COUNTRY, PAY OUR FAIR SHARE OF 

594
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:15,373
-- BY THIS COUNTRY, PAY OUR 

595
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:18,209
FAIR SHARE OF TAXES TO HELP 

596
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,210
PEOPLE COMING UP BEHIND US. 

597
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:24,282
[ APPLAUSE ] AND BY THE TIME I 

598
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,550
LEFT OFFICE, HOUSEHOLD INCOME 

599
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,552
WAS NEAR AN ALL-TIME HIGH AND 

600
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,821
THE UNINSURED RATE HIT AN ALL-

601
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:33,258
TIME LOW. 

602
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,492
WAGES WERE RISING, POVERTY 

603
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,229
RATES WERE FALLING. 

604
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,531
I MENTION THIS SO WHEN YOU HEAR 

605
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,965
HOW GREAT THE ECONOMY IS DOING 

606
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:41,966
RIGHT NOW, LET'S JUST REMEMBER 

607
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:42,600
WHEN THIS RECOVERY STARTED. 

608
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,237
[ APPLAUSE ] 

609
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,779
I MEAN, I'M GLAD IT HAS 

610
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,915
CONTINUED BUT WHEN YOU HEAR 

611
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,416
ABOUT THIS ECONOMIC MIRACLE 

612
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,653
THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON, WHEN 

613
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,456
THE JOB NUMBERS COME OUT, 

614
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,158
MONTHLY JOB NUMBERS, SUDDENLY 

615
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,560
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING IT IS A 

616
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,330
MIRACLE. 

617
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,098
I HAVE TO KIND OF REMIND THEM, 

618
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:15,500
ACTUALLY, THOSE JOB NUMBERS ARE 

619
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,070
THE SAME AS THEY WERE IN 2015. 

620
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,972
AND 2016. 

621
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:26,678
[ APPLAUSE ] ANYWAY, I DIGRESS. 

622
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:35,587
[ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] SO WE 

623
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,123
MADE PROGRESS BUT -- AND THIS 

624
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,892
IS THE TRUTH, MY ADMINISTRATION 

625
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,594
COULDN'T REVERSE FORTY-YEAR 

626
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,531
TRENDS IN ONLY 8 YEARS. 

627
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,034
ESPECIALLY ONCE REPUBLICANS 

628
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,136
TOOK OVER THE HOUSE OF 

629
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,236
REPRESENTATIVES IN 2010 AND 

630
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:54,372
DECIDED TO BLOCK EVERYTHING WE 

631
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:54,572
DID. 

632
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:58,343
EVEN THINGS THEY USED TO SUPPORT

633
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,112
, SO WE PULLED THE ECONOMY OUT 

634
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:04,182
OF CRISIS. BUT TO THIS DAY, TOO 

635
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,886
MANY PEOPLE WHO ONCE FELT 

636
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,455
SOLIDLY MIDDLE-CLASS STILL FEEL 

637
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,790
VERY REAL. 

638
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,760
AND VERY PERSONAL ECONOMIC 

639
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,828
INSECURITY. 

640
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,030
EVEN THOUGH WE TOOK OUT OSAMA 

641
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:26,171
BIN LADEN AND TOOK DOWN THE 

642
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:35,213
WARS IN IRAQ AND GOT IRAN TO 

643
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,748
HALT THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 

644
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,584
WORLD IS STILL FULL OF THREATS. 

645
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,685
THEY COME STREAMING THROUGH THE 

646
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:41,419
TELEVISION EVERY DAY. 

647
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,656
AND THE CHALLENGES GET PEOPLE 

648
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,125
WORRIED AND IT PHRASE OUR CIVIL 

649
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:53,998
-- FRAYS OUR CIVIL TRUST. 

650
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,969
AND IT FEELS LIKE THE GAME IS 

651
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:58,202
RIGGED. 

652
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,238
AND NOBODY IS LOOKING OUT FOR 

653
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:00,438
THEM. 

654
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,439
ESPECIALLY THOSE COMMUNITIES 

655
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:07,612
OUTSIDE THE BIG URBAN CENTERS. 

656
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,613
AND EVEN THOUGH YOUR GENERATION 

657
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,784
IS THE MOST DIVERSE IN HISTORY, 

658
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,052
WITH A GREATER ACCEPTANCE AND 

659
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,254
CELEBRATION OF OUR DIFFERENCES 

660
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,491
THAN EVER BEFORE, THOSE ARE THE 

661
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,959
KINDS OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE 

662
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,862
RIGHT FOR EXPLOITATION BY 

663
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:24,863
POLITICIANS WHO HAVE NO 

664
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,665
COMPUNCTION AND NO SHAME ABOUT 

665
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,900
TAPPING INTO AMERICA'S DARK 

666
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,169
HISTORY OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC 

667
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,608
AND RELIGIOUS DIVISION. 

668
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,044
APPEALING TO TRIBE, APPEALING 

669
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,214
TO FEAR, PUTTING ONE GROUP 

670
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,417
ANNOUNCED -- AGAINST ANOTHER, 

671
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,919
TELLING PEOPLE THAT ORDER AND 

672
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,155
SECURITY WILL BE RESTORED IF IT 

673
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,623
WEREN'T FOR THOSE WHO DON'T 

674
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,825
LOOK LIKE US OR DON'T SOUND 

675
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:58,196
LIKE US OR DON'T PRAY LIKE WE DO

676
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,432
, THAT'S AN OLD PLAYBOOK. 

677
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:05,903
IT'S AS OLD AS TIME. 

678
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:07,672
AND IN A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, IT 

679
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,574
DOES NOT WORK. 

680
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,410
OUR ANTIBODIES KICK IN. AND 

681
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,511
PEOPLE OF GOODWILL FROM ACROSS 

682
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,146
THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM CALLOUT 

683
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,716
BIGOTS AND THE FEARMONGER'S AND 

684
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,119
WORK TO COMPROMISE AND GET 

685
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,153
THINGS DONE. 

686
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,922
AND PROMOTE THE BETTER AGES OF 

687
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:29,160
THE NATURE -- NATION. 

688
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,262
BUT WHEN THERE IS A VACUUM IN 

689
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,964
THE DEMOCRACY, WHEN WE DON'T 

690
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:37,402
VOTE, WHEN WE TAKE OUR BASIC 

691
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,738
RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS FOR GRANTED,

692
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,041
WHEN WE TURN AWAY AND STOP 

693
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,177
PAYING ATTENTION, AND STOP 

694
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:50,481
ENGAGING, AND STOP BELIEVING, 

695
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,450
AND LOOK FOR THE NEWEST 

696
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,420
DIVERSION, THE ELECTRONIC 

697
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,960
VERSIONS OF CIRCUSES, THEN 

698
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,065
OTHER VOICES FILL THAT VOID. 

699
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,233
POLITICS OF FEAR AND RESENTMENT 

700
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:12,336
AND ENTRENCHMENT TAKES HOLD. 

701
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:14,371
THEY PROMISE SIMPLE FIXES TO 

702
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:16,908
COMPLEX ALBUMS. 

703
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,977
NOW PROMISED TO FIGHT FOR THE 

704
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,479
-- PROBLEMS. 

705
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,480
NOW PROMISED TO FIGHT FOR THE 

706
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:22,880
LITTLE GUY. 

707
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,915
NO PROMISE TO CLEAN UP 

708
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:25,950
CORRUPTION. 

709
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:31,155
AND THEN PLUNDER AWAY. THEY 

710
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,857
START UNDERMINING NORMS THAT 

711
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:36,294
ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRY 

712
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,362
TO CHANGE THE RULES TO ENTRENCH 

713
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:40,565
THEIR POWER FURTHER. 

714
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,934
AND THEY APPEAL TO RACIAL 

715
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:56,214
NATIONALISM. SOUND FAMILIAR? 

716
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,583
I UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT JUST A 

717
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:03,054
MATTER OF DAMS VERSUS -- 

718
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,090
DEMOCRATS VERSUS REPUBLICANS. 

719
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,993
AT VARIOUS TIMES, THIS HAS 

720
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:16,200
INFECTED BOTH PARTIES. SOUTHERN 

721
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,767
DEMOCRATS WERE THE BIGGER 

722
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:20,571
DEFENDERS OF SLAVERY. 

723
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,807
IT TO REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, 

724
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,411
NEIGHBORHOOD -- ABRAHAM 

725
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:31,115
LINCOLN, TO END IT. 

726
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,785
THEY POSED THE IDEA OF 

727
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,153
EXPANDING CIVIL RIGHTS. 

728
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,588
AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS A 

729
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,056
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND A 

730
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:43,127
MAJORITY CONGRESS SPURRED BY 

731
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,263
YOUNG MARCHERS AND PROTESTERS 

732
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,464
THAT GOT THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT 

733
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:51,035
OVER THE FINISH LINE, THOSE 

734
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,370
HISTORIC LAWS ALSO GOT PASSED 

735
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,904
BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP OF 

736
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:58,309
REPUBLICANS, LIKE ILLINOIS OWN 

737
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,480
EVERETT DIRKSEN. 

738
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,048
SO NEITHER PARTY HAS HAD A 

739
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,519
MONOPOLY ON WISDOM. 

740
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,887
NEITHER PARTY HAS BEEN 

741
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,391
EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR US 

742
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,625
GOING BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF 

743
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,663
FORWARDS. 

744
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,367
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS, BECAUSE 

745
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,270
SOMETIMES WE HEAR I'M PLAYING 

746
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,004
ON BOTH HOUSES. 

747
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:33,211
OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, IT 

748
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,346
WASN'T TRUE ONE JIM EGGER WAS 

749
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,583
GOVERNOR HERE IN ILLINOIS. 

750
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:44,055
OR JIM THOMPSON WAS GOVERNOR. I 

751
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,490
HAVE A LOT OF GOOD REPUBLICAN 

752
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,691
FRIENDS HERE IN ILLINOIS. 

753
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:53,097
THE POLITICS OF DIVISION AND 

754
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,332
PARANOIA HAS FOUND A HOME, 

755
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,399
UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE 

756
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:01,139
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

757
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,540
THIS CONGRESS HAS CHAMPIONED 

758
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,575
THE UNWINDING OF CAMPAIGN 

759
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,377
FINANCE LAWS TO GIVE 

760
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,813
BILLIONAIRES INFLUENCE ON 

761
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,481
POLITICS. 

762
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,116
SYSTEMATICALLY ATTACKING VOTING 

763
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,518
RIGHTS TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR 

764
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:17,955

770
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,947
BY THOSE SURROUNDING BENGHAZI. 

771
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,014
OR MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE. 

772
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:49,020
[ LAUGHTER ] REJECTED SCIENCE, 

773
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,056
REJECTED FAX ON THINGS LIKE

00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,225
CLIMATE CHANGE. 

775
00:34:54,225 --> 00:35:00,731
EMBRACED A RISING ABSOLUTISM 

776
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,200
FROM MY WILLINGNESS TO DEFAULT 

777
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,469
ON AMERICA'S DEBT BY NOT PAYING 

778
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,037
OUR PILLS TO REFUSAL TO EVEN

EVEN MEET A QUALIFIED NOMINEE 

781
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:16,547
FOR THE SUPREME COURT. NONE OF 

782
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:24,856
THIS IS CONSERVATIVE. 

783
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:29,694
I DON'T MEAN TO PRETEND I'M 

784
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,629
CHANNELING ABRAHAM LINCOLN NOW 

785
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,363
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE HAD IN 

786
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:36,334
MIND. 

787
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:40,471
I THINK, WHEN HE HELPED FORM 

788
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,872
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT IS NOT 

789
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:42,907
CONSERVATIVE, IT SURE ISN'T 

790
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,875
NORMAL. 

791
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:48,079
IT'S RADICAL. 

792
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,348
IT'S A VISION THAT SAYS THE 

793
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,449
PROTECTION OF OUR POWER AND 

794
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:55,119
THOSE WHO BACK US IS ALL THAT 

795
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,321
MATTERS EVEN WHEN IT HURTS THE 

796
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,122
COUNTRY. 

797
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,392
IT'S A VISION THAT SAYS THE FEW 

798
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,428
WHO CAN AFFORD HIGH-PRICED 

799
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:09,900
LOBBYISTS SET THE AGENDA. AND 

800
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,802
OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS, THIS 

801
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,138
VISION IS NOW NEARING ITS 

802
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:18,943
LOGICAL CONCLUSION. 

803
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,511
SO THAT WITH REPUBLICANS IN 

804
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,546
CONTROL OF CONGRESS, WITHOUT 

805
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:23,314
ANY CHECKS OR BALANCES 

806
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,648
WHATSOEVER, THEY HAVE PROVIDED 

807
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:28,618
ANOTHER $1.5 TRILLION IN TAX 

808
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:33,791
CUTS TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO, I 

809
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:38,963
PROMISE, DON'T NEED IT. 

810
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,366
AND DON'T EVEN PRETEND TO PAY 

811
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,770
FOR THEM. 

812
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,071
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PARTY 

813
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:51,275
OF FISCAL CONSERVATIVES HIM -- 

814
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,312
CONSERVATISM. 

815
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,780
WHEN THE DEFICIT WAS LOWER, 

816
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:01,118
THEY SAID I COULDN'T AFFORD TO 

817
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:01,786
HELP WORKING FAMILIES OR 

818
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,321
SENIORS ON MEDICARE BUS -- 

819
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,923
BECAUSE IT WAS A CRISIS. 

820
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,992
WHAT CHANGED? 

821
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:15,566
[ APPLAUSE ] WHAT CHANGED? 

822
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,735
THEY ARE SUBSIDIZING CORPORATE 

823
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,203
POLLUTERS WITH TAXPAYER 

824
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:19,503
DOLLARS. 

825
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,005
ALLOWING DISHONEST LENDERS TO 

826
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,574
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VETERANS AND 

827
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,077
CONSUMERS AGAIN. 

828
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,711
THEY HAVE MADE IT SO THAT THE 

829
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:32,583
ONLY NATION ON EARTH TO PULL OUT

830
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:38,889
OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AGREEMENT

831
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,091
, IT'S NOT NORTH KOREA, IT'S 

832
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,492
NOT SYRIAC, IT'S NOT RUSSIA OR 

833
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,760
SAUDI ARABIA, IT IS US. 

834
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,198
THE ONLY COUNTRY. THERE ARE A 

835
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,933
LOT OF COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. 

836
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,401
WE ARE THE ONLY ONES. 

837
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:56,941
[ APPLAUSE ] 

838
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,247
THEY ARE UNDERMINING ALLIANCES. 

839
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,615
COZYING UP TO RUSSIA. 

840
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,051
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REPUBLICAN 

841
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:12,390
PARTY? 

842
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,825
IT IS CENTRAL ORGANIZING 

843
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,995
PRINCIPLE IN FOREIGN POLICY. 

844
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:21,832
WAS THE FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM 

845
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,768
AND NOW THEY ARE CLOSING UP TO 

846
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:28,239
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE KGB. 

847
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:28,873
ACTIVELY BLOCKING LEGISLATION 

848
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,774
THAT WOULD DEFEND OUR ELECTIONS 

849
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:33,277
FROM RUSSIAN ATTACK. 

850
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,147
WHAT HAPPENED? 

851
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,316
THEY ARE SABOTAGING THE 

852
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,551
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 

853
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,253
IT IS ALREADY COST MORE THAN 

854
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:46,090
300 -- 3 MILLION AMERICANS THEIR

855
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,390
INSURANCE. 

856
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,158
IF THEY ARE STILL IN POWER NEXT 

857
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:51,195
FALL, YOU BETTER BELIEVE THEY 

858
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,296
ARE COMING AT IT AGAIN. 

859
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:56,066
THEY HAVE SAID SO. 

860
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:57,435
IN A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, THERE 

861
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:02,039
ARE SUMS -- SOME CHECKS AND 

862
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,440
BALANCES ON THIS BEHAVIOR, THIS 

863
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,943
INCONSISTENCY. BUT RIGHT NOW 

864
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:10,481
THERE IS NOTHING. 

865
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,652
REPUBLICANS WHO KNOW BETTER -- 

866
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,186
AND THEY ARE THERE, THEY ARE 

867
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:18,255
QUOTED SAYING WE KNOW THIS IS 

868
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,992
KIND OF CRAZY. THEY ARE STILL 

869
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,227
BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO 

870
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,497
SHIELD THIS BEHAVIOR FROM 

871
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,399
SCRUTINY OR ACCOUNTABILITY OR 

872
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:31,569
CONSEQUENCE. 

873
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,804
THEY SEEM UNWILLING TO FIND THE 

874
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:34,872
BACKBONE TO SAFEGUARD THE 

875
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,041
INSTITUTION THAT MAKE THE 

876
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,476
DEMOCRACY WORK. 

877
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,811
AND BY THE WAY, THE CLAIM THAT 

878
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,580
EVERYTHING WILL TURN OUT OKAY 

879
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,814
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE INSIDE 

880
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:47,318
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO SECRETLY 

881
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,154
EARNED FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S

882
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,757
ORDERS, THAT IS NOT A CHECK. 

883
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:56,093
I'M BEING SERIOUS HERE. 

884
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:56,994
THAT IS NOT HOW DEMOCRACY IS 

885
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:57,628
SUPPOSED TO WORK. 

886
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,798
[ APPLAUSE ] THESE PEOPLE ARE 

887
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,565
NOT ELECTED. 

888
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,001
THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE. 

889
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,737
THEY ARE NOT DOING US A SERVICE 

890
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:12,843
BY ACTIVELY PROMOTING 90% OF 

891
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:13,944
THE CRAZY STUFF THAT IS COMING 

892
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:14,879
OUT OF THIS WHITE HOUSE. 

893
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,179
AND THEN SING, DON'T WORRY. 

894
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:19,450
WE ARE PREVENTING THE OTHER 10%.

895
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,551
THAT'S NOT HOW THINGS ARE 

896
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:24,255
SUPPOSED TO WORK. 

897
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:29,693
THIS IS NOT NORMAL. 

898
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:30,894
SO THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY 

899
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:32,530
TIMES. 

900
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:37,001
AND THEY ARE DANGEROUS TIMES. 

901
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,803
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, IN 

902
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:43,507
TWO MONTHS, WE HAVE THE CHANCE, 

903
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:47,678
NOT THE CERTAINTY, BUT THE 

904
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:48,379
CHANCE TO RESTORE SOME 

905
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:51,982
SEMBLANCE OF SIMILE -- SANITY 

906
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,417
TO POLITICS. 

907
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:59,890
[ APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE THERE IS 

908
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,527
ACTUALLY ONLY ONE REAL CHECK ON 

909
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,062
BAD POLICY AND ABUSES OF POWER, 

910
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,898
AND THAT IS YOU. 

911
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:16,307
YOU AND YOUR VOTE. 

912
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,242
LOOK, AMERICANS WILL ALWAYS HAVE

913
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,011
DISAGREEMENTS ON POLICY. 

914
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:21,912
THIS IS A BIG COUNTRY. 

915
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,248
IT IS A RAUCOUS COUNTRY. 

916
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,582
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT POINTS OF 

917

918
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,553

1100
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,307
MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD, TO 

1101
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,574
ACTUALLY SOLVE PROBLEMS AND 

1102
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,276
MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER, WE 

1103
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:09,546
NEED A WELL-FUNCTIONING 

1104
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,280
GOVERNMENT. 

1105
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,983
WE NEED CIVIC INSTITUTIONS TO 

1106
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,918
WORK. 

1107
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:19,056
WE NEED COOPERATION AMONG PEOPLE

1108
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,824
OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL 

1109
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,360
PERSUASIONS. 

1110
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,896
AND TO MAKE THAT WORK, WE HAVE 

1111
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,465
TO RESTORE OUR FAITH IN 

1112
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:28,999
DEMOCRACY. 

1113
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,135
AND TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, 

1114
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:38,408
NOT TEAR THEM APART. 

1115
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:42,979
WE NEED MAJORITIES IN CONGRESS 

1116
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,248
AND LEGISLATURES WHO ARE 

1117
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,283
SERIOUS ABOUT GOVERNING AND 

1118
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,718
WANT TO BRING ABOUT REAL CHANGE 

1119
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:52,255
AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PEOPLE'S 

1120
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:52,789
LIVES. 

1121
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,192
AND WE WON'T WIN PEOPLE OVER BY 

1122
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,194
CALLING THEM NAMES. 

1123
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,262
OR DISMISSING ENTIRE CHUNKS OF 

1124
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,466
THE COUNTRY AS RACIST OR SEXIST 

1125
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,769
OR HOMOPHOBIC. 

1126
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:06,970
WHEN I SAY BRING PEOPLE 

1127
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,437
TOGETHER, I MEAN ALL OF THE 

1128
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:11,041
PEOPLE. NOW, THIS ENTIRE NOTION 

1129
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,777
THAT HAS SPRUNG UP ABOUT 

1130
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:14,978
DEMOCRATS NEEDING TO CHOOSE 

1131
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:18,148
BETWEEN TRYING TO APPEAL TO 

1132
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:22,486
WHITE WORKING-CLASS VOTERS OR 

1133
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:26,056
VOTERS OF COLOR AND WOMEN AND 

1134
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,492
LGBT AMERICANS, THAT'S 

1135
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:29,926
úNONSENS 

1136
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:30,760
I DON'T BUY THAT. 

1137
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,028
I GOT VOTES FROM EVERY 

1138
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:36,900
DEMOGRAPHIC. WE WON BY REACHING 

1139
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,969
OUT TO EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC AND 

1140
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,938
FIGHTING FOR EVERY VOTE. 

1141
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,240
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO 

1142
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,374
IN THIS ELECTION AND EVERY 

1143
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:44,841
ELECTION AFTER THAT. 

1144
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,911
[ APPLAUSE ] AND WE CAN'T DO 

1145
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,079
THAT IF WE IMMEDIATELY 

1146
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,247
DISREGARD WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO 

1147
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,082
SAY FROM THE START BECAUSE THEY 

1148
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,384
ARE NOT LIKE US. 

1149
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,154
BECAUSE THEY ARE WHITE OR THEY 

1150
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,188
ARE BLACK OR THEY ARE MAN OR 

1151
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,957
WOMAN OR GAIT OR STRAIGHT. 

1152
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,895
-- GAY OR STRAIGHT. 

1153
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,363
IF WE THINK THERE IS NO WAY 

1154
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,931
THEY CAN UNDERSTAND HOW I AM 

1155
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:08,732
FEELING, AND THEREFORE DON'T 

1156
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,935
HAVE ANY STANDING TO SPEAK ON 

1157
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,436
CERTAIN MATTERS BECAUSE WE ARE 

1158
00:51:13,436 --> 00:51:15,505
ONLY DEFINED BY CERTAIN 

1159
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:20,209
CHARACTERISTICS, THAT DOESN'T 

1160
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:21,344
WORK. 

1161
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,146
IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY

1162
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:25,482
, THAT DOESN'T WORK. 

1163
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,385
WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE TRAFFIC 

1164
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,486
IN ABSOLUTES WHEN IT COMES TO 

1165
00:51:30,486 --> 00:51:32,589
POLICY. 

1166
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,359
TO MAKE DEMOCRACY WORK, WE HAVE 

1167
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,395
TO BE ABLE TO GET INSIDE THE 

1168
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:42,866
REALITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 

1169
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:43,867
DIFFERENT AND HAVE DIFFERENT 

1170
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:44,501
EXPERIENCES AND COME FROM 

1171
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,001
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. 

1172
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,102
WE HAVE TO ENGAGE THEM EVEN 

1173
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,370
WHEN IT IS FRUSTRATING. 

1174
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,772
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM. 

1175
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,873
EVEN WHEN WE DON'T LIKE WHAT 

1176
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:50,774
THEY HAVE TO SAY. 

1177
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,476
WE HAVE TO HOPE THAT WE CAN 

1178
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,277
CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND WE AFTER 

1179
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,214
REMAIN OPEN TO THEM CHANGING 

1180
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:57,481
HOURS. 

1181
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:04,354
THAT DOESN'T MEAN -- OURS. 

1182
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:06,489
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO 

1183
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:10,660
CAVED ABOUT POLICY. 

1184
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:17,334
-- CAVE TO ADD POLICY. 

1185
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:25,609
-- BAD POLICY. 

1186
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,111
AND WE WILL ISSUE VAGUE 

1187
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,279
STATEMENTS OF DISAPPOINTMENT 

1188
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,215
WHEN HE DOES SOMETHING 

1189
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,150
OUTRAGEOUS BUT NOT ACTUALLY DO 

1190
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:33,850
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 

1191
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:40,590
THAT'S NOT CIVILITY. 

1192
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,992
THAT IS ABDICATING YOUR 

1193
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:42,392
RESPONSIBILITIES. 

1194
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:46,396
BUT AGAIN, I DIGRESS. 

1195
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:50,133
MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK MEANS 

1196
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,303
HOLDING ONTO OUR PRINCIPLES AND 

1197
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:54,170
HAVING CLARITY ABOUT PRINCIPLES 

1198
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,706
AND THEN HAVING THE CONFIDENCE 

1199
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,975
TO GET IN THE ARENA AND HAVE A 

1200
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:02,912
SERIOUS DEBATE. 

1201
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:04,480
AND IT ALSO MEANS APPRECIATING 

1202
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,483
THAT PROGRESS DOES NOT HAPPEN 

1203
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,585
ALL AT ONCE BUT WHEN YOU PUT 

1204
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,521
YOUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL, IF 

1205
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,622
YOU'RE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR, 

1206
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:18,128
THINGS TO GET BETTER. AND LET 

1207
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,362
ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. 

1208
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,630
PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE 

1209
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:25,435
HERE, BETTER IS GOOD. 

1210
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,170
I USED TO HAVE TO TELL MY YOUNG 

1211
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,471
STAFF THIS ALL THE TIME IN THE 

1212
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:28,905
WHITE HOUSE. 

1213
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,640
BETTER IS GOOD. 

1214
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,176
THAT'S THE HISTORY OF PROGRESS 

1215
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,477
IN THE COUNTRY. 

1216
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:34,877
NOT PERFECT. 

1217
00:53:34,877 --> 00:53:38,014
BETTER. 

1218
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,683
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT DIDN'T END 

1219
00:53:40,683 --> 00:53:44,620
RACISM, BUT IT MADE THINGS 

1220
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:47,791
BETTER. 

1221
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,125
SOCIAL SECURITY DIDN'T ELIMINATE

1222
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,329
ALL POVERTY FOR SENIORS, BUT IT 

1223
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,230
MADE THINGS BETTER FOR MILLIONS 

1224
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,266
OF PEOPLE. 

1225
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,369
DO NOT LET PEOPLE TELL YOU THE 

1226
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,805
FIGHT IS NOT WORTH IT BECAUSE 

1227
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,373
YU WON'T GET EVERYTHING THAT 

1228
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,376
YOU WANT. 

1229
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:10,947
THEY IDEA THAT THERE IS RACISM 

1230
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,349
IN AMERICA SO I'M NOT GOING TO 

1231
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,116
BOTHER VOTING. 

1232
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,218
NO POINT. 

1233
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,419
THAT MAKES NO SENSE. 

1234
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:26,363
YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER. 

1235
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,498
BETTER IS ALWAYS WORTH FIGHTING 

1236
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:29,232
FOR. 

1237
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,468
THAT'S HOW THE FOUNDERS EXPECTED

1238
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,836
THIS SYSTEM OF SELF-GOVERNMENT 

1239
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,604
TO WORK. 

1240
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,039
THAT THROUGH THE TESTING OF 

1241
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,374
IDEAS AND THAT APPLICATION OF 

1242
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:40,210
REASON AND EVIDENCE AND PROOF 

1243
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,044
WE COULD SORT THROUGH OUR 

1244
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:47,617
DIFFERENCES AND NOBODY WOULD 

1245
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,754
GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED 

1246
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:51,855
BUT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO 

1247
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:58,762
FIND A BASIS FOR COMMON GROUND. 

1248
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:04,567
AND THAT COMMON GROUND EXISTS. 

1249
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:05,802
MAYBE IT IS NOT FASHIONABLE TO 

1250
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,003
SAY THAT RIGHT NOW. 

1251
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:10,874
IT IS HARD TO SEE IT WITH ALL 

1252
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:11,908
THE NONSENSE IN WASHINGTON. 

1253
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,676
IT'S HARD TO HEAR IT WITH ALL 

1254
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:15,245
THE NOISE. 

1255
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:19,616
BUT COMMON GROUND EXISTS. 

1256
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:20,317
I HAVE SEEN IT. 

1257
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:25,955
I HAVE LIVED IT. 

1258
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,524
I KNOW THERE ARE WHITE PEOPLE 

1259
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,692
WHO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT BLACK 

1260
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:32,696
PEOPLE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY. 

1261
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,464
I HAVE TALKED TO THEM AND LOVED 

1262
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:41,838
THEM. AND I KNOW THERE ARE 

1263
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,972
BLACK PEOPLE WHO CARE DEEPLY 

1264
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:43,773
ABOUT THE STRUGGLES OF WHITE 

1265
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:44,374
RURAL AMERICA. 

1266
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,409
I'M ONE OF THEM. 

1267
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,144
AND I HAVE A TRACK RECORD TO 

1268
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:48,978
PROVE IT. 

1269
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:52,148
I KNOW THERE ARE EVANGELICALS 

1270
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,384
WHO ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO 

1271
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,986
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE 

1272
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:57,387
CHANGE. 

1273
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:02,459
I HAVE SEEN THEM DO THE WORK. 

1274
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:03,593
I KNOW THERE ARE CONSERVATIVES 

1275
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:04,494
WHO THINK THERE IS NOTHING 

1276
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:05,195
COMPASSIONATE ABOUT SEPARATING 

1277
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,463
IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM THEIR 

1278
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:08,031
MOTHERS. 

1279
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,265
I KNOW THERE REPUBLICANS WHO 

1280

01:04:56,291 --> 01:05:01,864
YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND. 

1468
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:02,164

>> VOTE. 

1472
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:06,702
IF YOU ARE REALLY CONCERNED 

1473
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:10,373
ABOUT HOW THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 

1474
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,541
SYSTEM TREATS AFRICAN-

1475
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,377
AMERICANS, THE BEST WAY TO 

1476
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,545
PROTEST IS TO VOTE, NOT JUST 

1477
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,948
FOR SENATORS AND 

1478
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:24,186
REPRESENTATIVES BUT FOR MAYORS 

1479
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,055
AND SHERIFFS AND STATE 

1480
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:26,388
LEGISLATORS. 

1481
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:28,691
DO WHAT THEY JUST DID IN 

1482
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:29,392
PHILADELPHIA AND BOSTON AND 

1483
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,093
ELECT STATE'S ATTORNEYS AND 

1484
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,161
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO ARE 

1485
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:34,697
LOOKING AT ISSUES IN A NEW 

1486
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,799
LIGHT, WHO REALIZE THAT THE 

1487
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,801
VAST MAJORITY OF LAW 

1488
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:39,802
ENFORCEMENT DO THE RIGHT THING 

1489
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:43,005
IN A REALLY HARD JOB, AND WE 

1490
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:46,375
JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL OF 

1491
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:46,675
THEM DO. 

1492
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:48,477
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF POLITICIANS 

1493
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:52,348
WHO OFFER NOTHING BUT THOUGHTS 

1494
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,983
AND PRAYERS AFTER A MASS 

1495
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,651
SHOOTING, YOU'VE GOTTA DO WHAT 

1496
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,552
THE PARKLAND KIDS ARE DOING. 

1497
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:58,120
SOME OF THEM AREN'T EVEN 

1498
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:58,888
ELIGIBLE TO VOTE YET. 

1499
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,423
THEY'RE OUT THERE WORKING TO 

1500
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:01,090
CHANGE MINDS AND REGISTERING 

1501
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,059
PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING 

1502
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,160
UP UNTIL WE HAVE A CONGRESS 

1503
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,795
THAT SEES YOUR LIVES AS MORE 

1504
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:14,470
IMPORTANT THAN A CAMPAIGN CHECK 

1505
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:14,837
FROM THE N.R.A. 

1506
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:20,709
YOU'VE GOTTA VOTE. 

1507
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:22,678
IF YOU SUPPORT THE "ME TOO" 

1508
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,214
MOVEMENT, YOU'RE OUTRAGED BY 

1509
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,149
STORIES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT 

1510
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,285
AND ASSAULT, INSPIRED BY THE 

1511
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,053
WOMEN WHO HAVE SHARED THEM, 

1512
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,855
YOU'VE GOTTA DO MORE THAN 

1513
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,190
RETWEET HASHTAG, YOU GOTTA 

1514
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:34,390
VOTE. 

1515
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,258
PART OF THE REASON WOMEN ARE 

1516
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,394
MORE VULNERABLE IN THE WORK 

1517
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:45,601
PLACE IS BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH 

1518
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,036
WOMEN ARE BOSSES IN THE WORK 

1519
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:47,269
PLACE. 

1520
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,305
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO 

1521
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:50,206
STRENGTHEN AND ENFORCE LAWS 

1522
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:53,943
THAT PROTECT WOMEN IN THE WORK 

1523
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,245
PLACE, NOT JUST FROM 

1524
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:56,946
HARASSMENT, BUT FROM 

1525
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:57,780
DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING AND 

1526
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,015
PROMOTION AND NOT GETTING PAID 

1527
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:03,319
THE SAME AMOUNT FOR DOING THE 

1528
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:03,619
SAME WORK. 

1529
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:07,857
THAT REQUIRES LAWS, LAWS GET 

1530
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:08,624
PASSED BY LEGISLATORS, YOU'VE 

1531
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:08,957
GOTTA VOTE. 

1532
01:07:08,957 --> 01:07:11,927
WHEN YOU VOTE, YOU'VE GOT THE 

1533
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,296
POWER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO 

1534
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,931
AFFORD COLLEGE AND HARDER TO 

1535
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:16,498
SHOOT UP A SCHOOL. 

1536
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:18,467
WHEN YOU VOTE, YOU'VE GOT THE 

1537
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:22,471
POWER TO MAKE SURE A FAMILY 

1538
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:23,906
KEEPS ITS HEALTH INSURANCE. 

1539
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,408
YOU COULD SAVE SOMEBODY'S LIFE. 

1540
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:28,077
WHEN YOU VOTE, YOU'VE GOT THE 

1541
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,679
POWER TO MAKE SURE WHITE 

1542
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,882
NATIONALISTS DON'T FEEL 

1543
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:37,886
EMBOLDENED TO MARCH WITH THEIR 

1544
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:46,996
HOODS OFF OR THEIR HOODS ON IN 

1545
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:50,632
CHARLOTTESVILLE IN THE MIDDLE 

1546
01:07:50,632 --> 01:07:56,105
OF THE DAY. 

1547
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:56,605
30 MINUTES. 

1548
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:57,138
30 MINUTES OF YOUR TIME. 

1549
01:07:57,138 --> 01:08:10,486
IS DEMOCRACY WORTH THAT? WE 

1550
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,086
HAVE BEEN THROUGH MUCH DARKER 

1551
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:13,355
TIMES THAN THESE, AND SOMEHOW 

1552
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:16,292
EACH GENERATION OF AMERICANS 

1553
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,060
CARRIED US THROUGH TO THE OTHER 

1554
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,229
SIDE, NOT BY SITTING AROUND AND 

1555
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:22,564
WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO 

1556
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:28,470
HAPPEN, NOT BY LEAVING IT TO 

1557
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:33,642
OTHERS TO DO SOMETHING, BUT BY 

1558
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:34,743
LEADING THAT MOVEMENT FOR 

1559
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:35,176
CHANGE THEMSELVES. 

1560
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:36,946
AND IF YOU DO THAT, IF YOU GET 

1561
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,380
INVOLVED AND YOU GET ENGAGED 

1562
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,983
AND YOU KNOCK ON SOME DOORS AND 

1563
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,086
YOU TALK WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND 

1564
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,921
YOU ARGUE WITH YOUR FAMILY 

1565
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:53,395
MEMBERS AND YOU CHANGE SOME 

1566
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,796
MINDS AND YOU VOTE, SOMETHING 

1567
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:55,197
POWERFUL HAPPENS. 

1568
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:59,901
CHANGE HAPPENS. 

1569
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:05,340
HOPE HAPPENS, NOT PERFECTION, 

1570
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:10,179
NOT EVERY BIT OF CRUELTY AND 

1571
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,015
SADNESS AND POVERTY AND DISEASE 

1572
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:15,184
SUDDENLY IS STRICKEN FROM THE 

1573
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:15,417
EARTH. 

1574
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,283
THERE WILL STILL BE PROBLEMS. 

1575
01:09:16,283 --> 01:09:17,620
BUT WITH EACH NEW CANDIDATE 

1576
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,854
THAT SURPRISES YOU WITH A 

1577
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:22,091
VICTORY THAT YOU SUPPORTED AS A 

1578
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,425
SPARK OF HOPE HAPPENS. 

1579
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:28,330
WITH EACH NEW LAW THAT HELPS A 

1580
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,366
KID READ OR HELPS A HOMELESS 

1581
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:33,035
FAMILY FIND SHELTER OR HELPS A 

1582
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:34,370
VETERAN GET THE SUPPORT HE OR

01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,707
SHE HAS EARNED, EACH TIME THAT 

1584
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:39,207
HAPPENS HOPE HAPPENS. 

1585
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:42,377
WITH EACH NEW STEP WE TAKE IN 

1586
01:09:42,377 --> 01:09:46,948
THE DIRECTION OF FAIRNESS AND 

1587
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:48,350
JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND 

1588
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,618
OPPORTUNITY HOPE SPREADS, AND 

1589
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,254
THAT CAN BE THE LEGACY OF YOUR 

1590
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:52,587
GENERATION. 

1591
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:57,026
YOU CAN BE THE GENERATION THAT 

1592
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,062

DEMOCRACY REALLY IS, JUST HOW 

1596
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:10,406
POWERFUL IT CAN BE WHEN WE 

1597
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:14,643
FIGHT FOR IT, WHEN WE BELIEVE 

1598
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:14,876

SAYING HOW HARD CAN THAT BE,

01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:52,981
SAYING THAT NAZIS ARE BAD. 

1623
