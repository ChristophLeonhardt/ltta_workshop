I can't believe this what kanye west's did is a cool thing well kanye west Edyta ben shapiro approve yeh time for yeh ok so kanye is now meeting with candice Owens and charlie kirk which is hilarious I know both Candice and Charlie and it's really really really funny so everything is hilarious and funny and a quick clarification if I did not make clear last week I think all of this is ridiculous and stupid I think that what Kanye is doing insofar as he is speaking up on behalf of individualism is a good thing but I think that the worship of celebrity in general is hilarious and stupid I think the worship of Kanye in specific is really stupid but Kanye is is doing something that I think is deeply necessary because the closed mindedness of the left is so crazy they're calling Jordan Peterson and all right Nick and they are suggesting that joy Reid gave a good apology the other day they are so closed off they've closed the window of acceptable discourse so tightly that anyone who is even slightly outside that window of acceptable discourse now must be banned so Kanye West came out last week of course in the greatest story in human history and suggested that not all black folks have to vote Democrat chance the rapper by the way tweeted the same thing and then backed off of it then chance the rapper said I understand it's true that not all black people have to vote Democrat but I shouldn't be saying that at this important time when Trump is president which is like what the hell and well what is it I mean real real pansy move dude I mean real pansy move if you're gonna say the black people don't have to vote Democrat that is true no matter who is the president you can say I don't like Trump but black people don't have to vote Democrat this is true but in any case Kanye made a big splash when he said that he's thinking for himself now and then obviously meeting with Candice Owens and Charlie Couric is just more evidence that he is thinking for himself it's pretty fascinating in hilarious well now president Trump is touting Kanye suit in a speech on Saturday night combating the White House Correspondents Association dinner and and here is president Trump allowing Kanye West and by the way in all fairness it's so good and he saw that when he sees that african-american unemployment is the lowest in history you know people are watching that's a very important thing he's done for his legacy it's a very important thing but Hispanic unemployment lowest level in history it's just incredible ok so Kanye comes out and Trump of course is willing to go out there and talk about it and then Kanye did something else and this action thing is kind of cool ok Allah I will acknowledge when when Kanye does something that's cool right I think that it's cool that he's speaking about individualism then he did something else you released a track called yay versus the people I got it right this time it's not yeah it's yay versus the people even though it spelled ye all right and his his rap song is with a rapper named ti which is of course his given name he came out of his mother's womb and they called him ti and and Kanye and Kanye is rapping with ti and the point of this rap song is that they are discussing exactly what Kanye has been doing and he lets Ti go at him he lets see I say dude you're selling out black folks and it's really terrible what you're doing and good for Kanye right I mean this is something that we've tried to do with the daily wire like we used to have John Nolte right over here John Nolte is a very very Pro Trump guy and I disagree with him about a lot of things but what I said is listen it's a point of view I think is worth clarifying and in our conflict you can see the clarification so Kanye is actually hosting a debate here hey Kanye is saying come on into my house and we're going to have a rap battle with each other about an issue that matters which is kind of a cool thing I'll acknowledge this is kind of anything now I think the song sucks but I'm know kind of sort of rap later I think I think all rap songs suck basically but here's Kanye and Ti talking about yay-yay versus the people to show people that we just this back and forth back and forth and if you can't hear what he's actually saying says I never ever stopped fighting for the people this Kanye actually we're in this handle show people that we equal and then Ti responds you got to see the vantage point of the people what you met what you what makes you feel equal makes them feel evil and then he says that's the problem with this damn nation all blacks got to be Democrats man we ain't made it off the plantation and then Ti responds F who you chooses your political party you representing dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted with blatant disregard for the people who put you in position don't you feel an obligation to them and then Kanye responds I feel an obligation to show people new ideas and if you want to hear them there go to right here make America great again had a negative perception I took it war rocked it gave it a new direction at an empathy carrot and love and affection and y'all simply questioning my methods and can quibble with the with the rhyme scheme there but what he's attempting to do here is actually something kind of neat but he's attempting to do here is actually host again a debate about an issue inside the black community which is something more than it's happened in popular culture any time in the recent past and then at the very end but at the very end Kanye says all right tip we could be rapping about this all day man why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk so there's actually really cool what he did there like I can't believe this what Kanye West did is a cool thing what Kanye West said is something that I've been Shapiro approve okay I approve it it's a good thing like this is an actual good use of rap for opening up minds and opening up debate and again it's not just about him saying that you like Trump it's about actually opening up debate which is really a kind of anything
