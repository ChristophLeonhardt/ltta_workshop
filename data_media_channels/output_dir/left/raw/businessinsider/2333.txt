00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,420
welcome back with us gene munster at

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">piper jaffray who covers apple and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet industry gene so in two weeks</font>

4
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:22,890
supposedly there's going to be this

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple event the company hasn't said</font>

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,230
anything about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet officially but you</font>

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,510
know everyone kind of knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going</font>

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,460
to happen are you convinced<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font>

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,930
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the tablet is going to be</font>

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,210
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this event yeah we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,430
waiting for this since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer of two</font>

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,200
thousand seven so this is a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,480
they coming for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and based on some</font>

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,340
conversations we've had with a Taiwanese

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,050
components of fire we believe that that

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,129
will be the case they're going to

17
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,410
announce the tablet cool and and what's

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,180
your your vision for at least this first

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,370
tablet I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually tablet</font>

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,750
is just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a feature on a lot</font>

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,270
of apple products from portables to some

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,430
of the max<font color="#E5E5E5"> even but this first kind of</font>

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,690
series what how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they're</font>

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the public interested in a</font>

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,030
category of electronics that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,439
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do well now or doesn't even</font>

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,030
really exist yeah that's the big

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,799
questions what's the use case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,080
and there's two perspectives on it first

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,549
is to look back actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we learned</font>

31
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the ipod before the ipod or the</font>

32
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,689
iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the iphone actually came</font>

33
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">out a lot of people thought it was going</font>

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually be an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipod with one of the</font>

35
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,299
you'd go down on your click wheel on

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,159
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit phone and make a call from it</font>

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,479
turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be something very</font>

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">different so the use case turned out to</font>

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,689
be something very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different so in some</font>

40
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:31,829
ways we kind of want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and see</font>

41
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,200
exactly what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is but based on what we</font>

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,119
know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what Apple has told us in</font>

43
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,530
the past is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to be a</font>

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">product that's going to most likely</font>

45
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,250
target the netbook market so portability

46
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,540
is going to be one of its virtues a

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,860
price point that's less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font>

48
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,530
existing max in a media rich experience

49
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,600
which likely will impact from publishers

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,850
and a different type of environment that

51
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,470
you'll interact with websites in a

52
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,020
different way a new way so what's the

53
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,399
use case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's this really going</font>

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,840
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the simple way to think about it</font>

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of the edgy cutting-edge</font>

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,979
netbook user<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's got a little bit of</font>

57
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">extra money initially but over time they</font>

58
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,790
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move that price point down and maybe</font>

59
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,110
show some features that we don't know

60
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,840
about right now so last week at CES deep

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,290
bomber brought out this tab

62
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,360
from HP and a couple others and you know

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,400
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> yawn it was not very</font>

64
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting what is it do you think</font>

65
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,290
Apple is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to do that HP</font>

66
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,659
and Microsoft and the other tablet

67
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">makers so far have not been able to do</font>

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,510
both in terms of design ease of use of

69
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,370
features applications what what can

70
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,470
Apple do different and better that would

71
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,120
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to spend money well</font>

72
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this people keep coming back</font>

73
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,780
this but the reality is what Apple can

74
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,189
do is an ecosystem and this other

75
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:41,379
devices can't do it and it really starts

76
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,819
with iTunes and I don't think Apple

77
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have predicted seven years ago</font>

78
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that iTunes would be such a critical</font>

79
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,439
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their business but a device like</font>

80
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,239
this a tablet dies like this is going to

81
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,639
be a media experience and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only do</font>

82
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,709
you want music<font color="#E5E5E5"> but video and also books</font>

83
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,409
and newspapers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine this device</font>

84
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,819
and what's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than maybe what the</font>

85
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,439
HP device would be allowed to go to

86
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,620
iTunes to subscribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some some</font>

87
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,109
newsletters or or or typically what

88
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:06,700
would be a magazine a different

89
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,650
experience from that end but also just

90
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,159
an ease of use and connectivity with

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,750
iTunes I think it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that none</font>

92
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,970
of these devices can offer also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

93
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,919
from a touchscreen perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple's</font>

94
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,959
notorious for having fabulous touch

95
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,000
technology obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> this finger worse</font>

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,769
technology they acquired five years ago

97
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,629
could play<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this and so I think</font>

98
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:26,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a different</font>

99
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,260
experience and lastly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the apps is</font>

100
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,389
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device will likely run apps</font>

101
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,739
probably not the same apps as your

102
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,750
iPhone but will likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> run apps and so I</font>

103
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,849
think the combination of all three of

104
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,349
those are something that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

105
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,510
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different experience for people</font>

106
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,340
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tablet versus the HP have you</font>

107
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,709
heard of any specific corks hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

108
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,720
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> wise that it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be part of</font>

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,909
the device well we all we've heard is

110
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,760
that it's a from a screen size attendant

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,579
screen but from our perspective our

112
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:57,159
specific component supplier is more on

113
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the processing speed side and it looks</font>

114
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this is going to be a robust device</font>

115
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,680
I mean this is going to be essentially a

116
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,379
laptop and a tablet so that that's

117
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,970
that's the extent that we have I had a

118
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,370
wacky dream where Steve Ballmer pulled

119
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,159
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a stolen apple tablet prototype and</font>

120
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,079
showed it to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was aluminum back</font>

121
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">wow so did you get to use it a little</font>

122
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,339
bit not much but it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very weird</font>

123
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">dream in terms of publishers publishers</font>

124
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,360
are going nuts

125
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,009
for the tablet they don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

126
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:25,270
how much they know about what it

127
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,949
actually is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be and what</font>

128
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,240
features it's going to have and whether

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,219
they would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish magazines</font>

130
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,409
and newspapers as apps through the app

131
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,960
store or I've even<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard stuff like</font>

132
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,610
they're thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> adobe air will be</font>

133
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,580
part of this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> personally doubt that but</font>

134
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,180
do you think that that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Theus Lee books</font>

135
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,099
and magazines would be an ideal feature

136
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,689
for something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this do you think</font>

137
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,150
that's something that apple will try to

138
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,530
control the sale of the way they do via

139
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">iTunes where they stock the virtual you</font>

140
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">know music albums and videos and sell</font>

141
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,810
them direct to consumer or do you think

142
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more like the app store</font>

143
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,169
model where the publisher is the one

144
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,719
that produces the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bundle and</font>

145
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,909
sells it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the consumer and then Apple</font>

146
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:09,159
takes their cut I think it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

147
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,930
different for the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> publishers side</font>

148
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,240
versus like a book publisher versus like

149
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,710
a magazine<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example I think will be</font>

150
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,509
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different models I think more of as</font>

151
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,550
the blogsphere wants to probably address

152
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,650
an application for a tablet like this

153
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,419
they'll have kind of a self submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

154
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,340
itunes or to whatever the store they

155
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,919
might have and then also with the actual

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,360
books<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's going to be more</font>

157
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,860
regulated if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what itunes</font>

158
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,050
does today ottimo<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks are provided</font>

159
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,789
through Amazon Apple has a deal through

160
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:35,589
Amazon where they do a revenue share so

161
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:37,479
you could see something where<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon</font>

162
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,250
actually provides the books<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

163
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,379
through but we do know from some

164
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,210
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> from people close to the</font>

165
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,830
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it sounds like the book</font>

166
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,900
side is lower on their priority list in

167
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,129
other words it's probably a feature that

168
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,080
will be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tablet but as far as is</font>

169
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,550
it going to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work as well as the</font>

170
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,979
kindle probably not but the publishing

171
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,419
experience is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be something that</font>

172
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are really going to take</font>

173
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,120
notes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple may have more control</font>

174
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,539
over publishing on the tablet ecosystem

175
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:03,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">they do with the iphone where it's very</font>

176
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,289
much just a publisher makes the app app

177
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,089
goes to the consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the book</font>

178
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,889
side they'll have more control<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

179
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:10,919
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about more real-time</font>

180
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,139
magazines more more publishers online

181

publishers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a self</font>

182
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,099
submit type of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model and then lastly</font>

183
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,750
in terms of the impact on<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple's</font>

184
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,439
business the iphone in two and a half

185
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,589
years has quickly become if you remove

186
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:28,210
the subscription accounting you know a

187
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,620
massive massive part of their revenue

188
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,680
profits is the tablet something that

189
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,419
could achieve those kind of results or

190
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,910
is it going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a model of a</font>

191
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mac or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple models of the iPhone</font>

192
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,199
whether it you know it's part of a

193
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,270
larger story but not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story</font>

194
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,490
the way the iphone has become we think

195
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the tablet as part of the iphone</font>

196
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,750
story and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all part of mobile</font>

197
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,310
computing and over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next decade</font>

198
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,110
mobile is going to be the fastest growth

199
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,870
in hardware sales and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font>

200
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,850
part of this mobile family and so

201
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,590
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't think that the</font>

202
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,600
tablet is going to be at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least from from</font>

203
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,220
how we see it today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price points</font>

204
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,449
we see today it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be as</font>

205
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,460
mainstream as the iphone the addressable

206
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">market certainly isn't as big as the</font>

207
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,789
phone market but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font>

208
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,860
important piece to their overall mobile

209
00:07:12,860 --> 00:00:00,000
strategy great thanks gene thank you
