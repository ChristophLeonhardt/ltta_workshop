so let me get this straight judging by last Sunday's leadership debate NDP leader Andrea Horwath felt entitled to constantly interrupt PC leader Doug Ford and to occasionally interrupt premier Kathleen Wynn but when she's interrupted at a donut shop this makes for the end of civility as we know it Oh give me a break if you missed it here is a highlight reel or is that a lowlight reel of Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath who just couldn't stop interrupting her opponents at the last leadership debate some might say this is the Horwath being a feisty competitor I call it rude and crude you be the judge their plans their plans out the window mr. Ford not sure their plan is actually up the window you made a seven billion dollar mistakes and the Liberals are cooking the board by your childcare plan will actually create weightless your plan has people Chuck paying 2,000 dollars a month for childcare in Toronto you're spamming hong mr. 30 40 50 billion dollars where's your money coming from what was that Arnold Schwarzenegger quote from Kindergarten Cop and to think that Horwath had the utter hood spot to say that ford's constant attacks were divisive seriously Andrea anyway the day after that leadership debate Horwath drops by Tim horns for a press conference in Mississauga and like a brigade of army ants to the picnic basket who should also show up at that Timmy's but none other than the local liberal MPP Shafiq Qadri and some of his minions happening here we've got some liberal supporters who have come in to I think it's unfortunate that I think it's unfortunate that they've decided to do this but happy that I'm here in the rioting happy that I'm here nice to see you should peek you know what am I going to say I think it's a it's their decision to behave that way they'll have to explain it for themselves I'm sorry sheepy sheepy if you don't mind I'm gonna finish my press conference and then you can have all the time you want to talk to the media now unquestionably crashing this press conference was a big misstep by Qadri but still the question arises how is it that Horwath got to incessantly interrupt Ford and win at the TV studio debate without the debate moderators ever chastising her for being so rude yet a member of the media at a cafe goes to bat for her bath about Kadri flying the liberal colors during an NDP dog and pony show and like I said Cod was showing up there with a big red liberal banner that was really a dumb idea but until the reporter made an issue of it at least the guy was relatively quiet so why the double standard when it comes to interruptions well my answer was this I think the media party which usually runs interference for the Liberals recognizes a sinking ship when they see one and like so many rats abandoning the Titanic apparently orange is the new red in Ontario so it is that Doug Ford can be interrupted incessantly whereas no one dares interrupt Lady Horwath after all Andrea is soon to be the new sheriff in town or so the media party hopes given the blue alternative for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download the rebel media app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
