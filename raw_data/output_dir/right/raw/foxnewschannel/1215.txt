1
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:04,987
SO.

2
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:05,654
LELAND: MOLLY HENNEBERG WITH

3
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:07,022
THAT DEVELOPMENT.

4
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:09,024
THANK YOU GOOD LIVES.

5
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:11,927
>> FOR MORE INSIGHT, LET'S HAVE

6
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:13,262
A STAFF WRITER WITH THE

7
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:13,862
"WASHTINGTON EXAMINER."

8
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:16,832
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

9
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:18,333
RIGHT OFF THE TALK ON THE

10
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,535
DETAILS OF THE NEGOTIATION FOR

11
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:20,936
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MAY

12
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:21,703
NOT BE SOMETHING WHOLLY NEW.

13
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:24,306
AM I RIGHT?

14
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:25,941
>> THE DRAMA OVER SCHEDULING THE

15
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:26,675
SUMMIT IS NEW, BUT THE DETAILS

16
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:29,945
NECESSARILY AREN'T.

17
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,547
WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE IN THE

18
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:32,281
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION PUSHED

19
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,015
FOR AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NORTH

20
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:35,083
KOREANS EARLY ON IN THE 90s

21
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,786
ONLY TO HAVE KIM JONG UN FATHER

22
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:40,856
CHEAT ON THE AGREEMENT ENRICHED

23
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:41,423
URANIUM ON THE SIDE OF

24
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:43,358
EVERYTHING FALL APART.

25
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:45,027
THE UNITED STATES CUT OFF THE

26
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:48,697
OIL SUPPLY AND WE WERE BACK TO

27
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:49,698
SQUARE ONE.

28
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:51,767
I THINK THAT SORT OF REMEMBRANCE

29
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:52,501
IS WHAT INSPIRED THE CAUTION WE

30
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,103
ARE HEARING FROM.

31
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:55,771
GENERAL MATTIS SAID THIS IS

32
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:59,808
GOING TO BE A BUMPY RIDE.

33
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:00,943
ELIZABETH: SO WHAT IS NEW ASIDE

34
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:04,846
FROM DETAILS OF THE MEETING.

35
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:08,584
HIS ENRICHED URANIUM AND NOW WE

36
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:09,384
HAVE SOME NEW I GUESS YOU COULD

37
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:13,422
SAY FACTORS IN NEGOTIATIONS.

38
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:15,223
>> COMMEMORATIVE COINS AND

39
00:01:15,223 --> 00:01:17,893
ENVELOPES ASIDE, THERE ARE TWO

40
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:18,226
FACTORS.

41
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:18,894
NORTH KOREA HAS 16 NUCLEAR

42
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:21,263
MISSILES RIGHT NOW.

43
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:23,065
THE REAL DIFFERENCES YOU HAVE A

44
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:24,066
PRESIDENT WHO IS UNCONVENTIONAL

45
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:27,336
IN HIS APPROACH TO NEGOTIATIONS.

46
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:31,039
DECADES USING NEW FACT OR HERE

47
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,975
AND I THINK HE'S MADE

48
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:36,078
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:37,613
GETTING IN A RATIONAL ACTOR TO

50
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:38,347
ACT SOMEWHAT RATIONALLY AND COME

51
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:39,982
TO THE TABLE.

52
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:42,117
BUT THERE IS A RISK LIKE MITCH

53
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:42,884
McCONNELL WARNED THAT YOU

54
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:44,720
MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH THE DEAL

55
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,888
TOO MUCH THAT YOU DON'T FOCUS ON

56
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:50,826
THE DETAILS AND IN THE END YOU

57
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:51,693
RISK.

58
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:54,296
>> TO GO THE PRESIDENT IS BEING

59
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:54,663
CAUTIOUS?

60
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:55,330
AT ONE POINT HE DID SAY ON

61
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,299
FRIDAY WHERE HE SAID LISTEN,

62
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,668
THIS IS A PROCESS.

63
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:01,169
WE TALK ABOUT THE MEETING BUT IT

64
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:02,871
COULD BE ONE OF MANY MEETINGS.

65
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:03,639
YOU SUSPECT THAT IS THE CASE

66
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,708
AFTER JUNE 12?

67
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,276
>> CLEARLY THIS IS GOING TO BE A

68
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:09,911
PROCESS BECAUSE THE NORTH

69
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,446
KOREANS HAVE ONE DEFINITION

70
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:13,548
DENUCLEARIZATION AND WE HAVE A

71
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:14,249
VERY DIFFERENT DEFINITION AND

72
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:15,851
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW ARE WE GOING

73
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,753
TO ENFORCE AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT

74
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:18,453
THEY DON'T ACHIEVE THE SECOND

75
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:19,855
TIME AROUND.

76
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:24,159
THERE WILL BE A PROCESS, THAT

77
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,661
THERE HAVE BEEN CONFLICTING

78
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:26,395
APPROACHES FROM THE PRESIDENT.

79
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:30,098
HE GETS TOUGH ON NORTH KOREA AND

80
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:30,799
THEN KIM JONG UN NUMBER TWO IN

81
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,568
THE OVAL OFFICE.

82
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:34,770
IT'S GOING TO BE A PROCESS LIKE

83
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,771
YOU SAID.

84
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:36,571
AT THIS POINT WE HAVE TO BUCKLE

85
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:40,175
UP AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

86
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:41,810
ELIZABETH: SECRETARY MATTIS AS

87
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,511
YOU MENTIONED IN SINGAPORE AND

88
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:45,213
YOU TALK ABOUT THE GAP IN

89
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:45,681
EXPECTATIONS.

90
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:46,481
WE SEE THE GAP GETS SMALLER AND

91
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:49,117
SMALLER OVER THE NEXT NINE DAYS.

92
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,520
>> WE ALL KIND OF TALKED ABOUT

93
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,122
THAT IN THE LETTER THAT WAS

94
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:55,424
GIVEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

95
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,558
THAT'S A PERFECT ENCAPSULATION

96
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:57,459
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

97
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,762
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MORE THAN

98
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:01,963
HAPPY AND THEN THE SECRET

99
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:02,731
SERVICE SWOOPS IN AND SAYS WE

100
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:03,832
NEED TO CHECK TO MAKE CERTAIN

101
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:04,533
THERE IS NOTHING POISONOUS OR

102
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:06,268
WRONG WITH THEM.

103
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:06,968
THAT KIND OF SHOWS YOU HAVE A

104
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:10,972
PRESIDENT HERE WHO WANTS TO BE

105
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:11,540
PERSONAL, CHARMING AND

106
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,542
CHARISMATIC AND GET THE DEAL

107
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:14,376
DONE.

108
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:15,610
BUT THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE AT THE

109
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,545
STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE

110
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:17,279
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE

111
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,847
SEEN THIS PLAY OUT BEFORE.

112
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,382
IT IS UP IN THE AIR, THE

113
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:21,049
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BRINGING

114
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,821
SOMETHING NEW AND PERHAPS THAT'S

115
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:26,154
NEEDED.

116
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,656
ELIZABETH: WHAT ARE YOUR

117
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:28,390
PREDICTIONS AFTER COVERING THE

118
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,124
WHITE HOUSE AND WHAT HE THINKS

119
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:31,927
GOING TO HAPPEN?

120
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,729
>> THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SAY

121
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:34,362
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IS

122
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:35,063
EVERYTHING SO UNPREDICTABLE.

123
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:37,399
THE ONE THING WE DID SAY IS THE

124
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,934
WILLINGNESS TO WALK AWAY FROM

125
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:39,568
THE TABLE.

126
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:41,703
HE GOT KIM JONG UN TO SHOW SOME

127
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:43,238
CONFESSION TO ASK MORE POLITELY

128
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:45,607
IF YOU WILL.

129
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:49,911
I THINK WE COULD SEE AN INITIAL

130
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:50,645
AGREEMENT, BUT IT'S MUCH LONGER

131
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:52,481
IN THE FOLLOW-THROUGH.

132
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,915
>> AND ALSO LESSONS LEARNED FROM

133
00:03:53,915 --> 00:00:00,000
THE IRAN DEAL.
