1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,780
Every ten years, states have to redraw their
voting districts.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,540
In most cases, politicians get to control
that process.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,530
And if they're clever about how the districts
are drawn, they can make it easier for their

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,280
own party to win more of them.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,240
It's called "Partisan Gerrymandering".

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,380
And Pennsylvania is the latest state to get
busted for it.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,420
So when you redistrict, there's a phenomenal
degree of possible manipulation.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,659
Almost any shape you want to make is possible.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,830
Professor Cho is a political scientist who
developed an algorithm that can spot unfair

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,830
maps.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,559
The Court wants to be able to determine the
intent behind the district maps.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,320
Basically they want to read the mind of the
map drawer.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,400
It doesn't have any way to do this.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,060
Politicians have to follow a certain criteria
when they're making a new map.

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,850
Some criteria are required by law, for instance
we have to have about the same number of people

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,840
in every district and all districts have to
be contiguous.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,180
In Pennsylvania, these districts also have
to be compact.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,280
Then, there's other criteria that the Supreme
Court has emphasized when they make decisions

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,830
about redistricting.

20
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,100
The Court wants districts that preserve political
subdivisions like cities, counties, municipal

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,100
boundaries.

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,150
So whenever you find an identifiable community
of likeminded individuals, Court likes it

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,850
when those people are kept together in the
same district.

24
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,620
Pennsylvania's districts were deemed partisan
because of that last guideline.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,320
If you look at the 2011 map, the lines are
all contiguous and each district has a roughly

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
equal population.

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,600
But the map also divides up several counties,
which violates traditional districting principles.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,659
And that made it easier for Republicans to
win congressional seats in the state.

29
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:53,549
The popular vote in the House race was basically
equal in both elections that used this map,

30
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,380
but the Republicans won more than twice the
number of seats in Congress.

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,640
Then a group of voters sued.

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,760
And the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that
the map had to change.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,300
This is the new map.

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,239
The lines are still contiguous and the population
is still proportionate.

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,800
But now, only 13 counties are split up instead
of 28.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,120
That protects the traditional districting
principles.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,260
The Republican party plans to countersue,
arguing that the new map will favor Democrats.

38
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,709
They hope to win as many as five more congressional
seats in Pennsylvania because of it.

39
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:35,920
And those seats could be a part of a larger
shift in power in the House of Representatives.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,050
Which is why the fight over these two maps
is so heated.

41
00:02:39,050 --> 00:00:00,000
And it's also why Pennsylvania probably won't
be the last state to get called out for gerrymandering.
