I'm atrocious saying there's a tape of Trump saying the n-word I don't know you know cept Oracle was on yesterday saying that there was such a tape it would be out by now and I don't even want to debate it I'm sure that Donald Trump has said some terrible terrible things he says terrible things all the time yeah you know I hear him say terrible things I see him tweet terrible things I will say if he's a racist I mean a true racist a guy who's out to do harm to black people he is the worst racist in history because he's black people are doing great in the Trump administration he is elevating them I truly don't that as I said before I think if you're for him he's for you if you're against him he's against you that's the way Trump works but I don't want to say this about the n-word okay George Carlin I think back in the 60s Amos countercultural comedian he kind of got swept up in the sixties counterculture and he became this famous countercultural comedian used to do this routine called the seven words you can't say on television and he strung together every dirty word and just repeated them over and over again and the idea was they had no meaning it was just us saying you know that this these were dirty words they weren't really dirty words that that was a real it was a really funny and creative routine it wasn't true it's not true if I can say the word oaktree and you can think of an oak tree I can say the f-word and make you think that sex is a degraded violent ugly thing that can be used as a way of cursing other people out I mean words have meanings and words communicate thoughts and feelings that to say a word is ugly just because we say it's ugly is ridiculous it's ugly because that is its meaning in the world the left has managed to declare that these words that degrade sex that the grave bodily functions these words that degrade you know human beings are fine now fine you can say them on TV
