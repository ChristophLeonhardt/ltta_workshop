1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:15,280
You know this scene from The Wizard of Oz.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,270
It happens just after Dorothy croons in sepia-toned
Kansas,

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,679
Toto wags his tail,
and the house gets caught in a tornado.

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,579
She travels from a faded film strip to a Technicolor
world.

5
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,990
But there are three things about this scene
you might get wrong.

6
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,210
And each one helps show the real history of
Technicolor.

7
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,040
These misconceptions explain what the
“Technicolor triumph” really was, from

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,710
the technical aspects that made it work, to
exactly why it took over the movies, to the

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:55,600
way in which the technology shaped the look
of the 20th century.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,440
Lie #1 - Wizard of Oz is not the first Technicolor
movie.

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,610
Not even close.

12
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,249
You might know that, but a lot of people don’t.

13
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:13,460
Come on Maryland Science Center, you’re
better than this.

14
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,259
Historian Barbara Flueckiger has an exhaustive
timeline of color in film, from

15
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:21,240
hand-painted film
to the first movie filmed in “kinemacolor,”

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,929
A Visit to the Seaside.

17
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:28,770
But Technicolor stood out, and even it has
a history that long predates The Wizard of

18
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,770
Oz.

19
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:36,700
Herbert Kalmus, Daniel Frost Comstock, and
W. Burton Wescott founded the company in 1914,

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,960
with the “Tech” referring to MIT, where
Kalmus and Comstock met.

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,149
It started by merging red and green - into
a new image that roughly looked like this.

22
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:55,229
You can see the look in this range of movies
from the late 1920s and early 30s.

23
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,460
It could do passably well with skin tones,
but

24
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,049
there’s no blue in these dresses for a reason.

25
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:09,440
Blue came into the mix in 1932, when Technicolor
added the key third strip.

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,220
They showed off the process in Walt Disney’s
Flowers and Trees, a gorgeous animated feature

27
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,730
that was a botanist’s nightmare.

28
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,959
You know, there are evil trees in Wizard of
Oz, too.

29
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,180
“What do you think you’re doing?”

30
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,700
Anyway, in order to get Technicolor to work,
it was an insanely difficult process.

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,860
Technicolor distributed
guides like these

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,180
and we can make a reasonable simulation digitally,
with a scene like this.

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,840
So here’s a scene of some Lego people who
are apparently worshipping Lawrence of Arabia?

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,319
Not sure what’s going on here, but it’s
our starting image.

35
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,970
A technicolor camera would typically take
that picture and shoot it through a prism

36
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,409
that split the light into red, blue, and green
negatives for the picture.

37
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:55,439
Those negatives were then flipped into positive
“matrices,”

38
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,890
which eventually got soaked with dyes of the
complementary colors.

39
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:06,400
So the red matrix turned cyan, the green one
magenta, and the blue one yellow.

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,760
Then the dye was transferred — this was
called a “dye transfer process” to create

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,390
a final gorgeous Technicolor image.

42
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,330
So if you’re anything like me, that explanation
might make you feel like the scarecrow.

43
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,000
“Oh I’m a failure because I haven’t
got a brain.”

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,450
So let’s try it again, but only look at
that red channel.

45
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,579
So keep your eye on the View-Master, the red
in the Rubik’s cube, or maybe the Lego guy’s

46
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,579
hat.

47
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,849
It is all kind of dark now, because that’s
just the red color in the negative.

48
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:40,840
Now flipped in the matrix, that red is really
bright, which means that when it’s dyed,

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,680
it won’t get a lot of
cyan.

50
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,439
And that makes sense.

51
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,769
Cyan is the complementary color — it’s
the anti-red.

52
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,189
So where you want a lot of red, you do not
want a lot of cyan.

53
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,780
That way, when it comes together, you get
a ton of magenta and some yellow.

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,170
You don’t have a lot of cyan, because the
cyan cancels out the red.

55
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,439
In the earlier days of Technicolor, they also
had to amp up the contrast.

56
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,749
The company would add a black and white layer
underneath the matrices to serve as something

57
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:13,310
called "the key."

58
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,000
You can see the results early, in films like
1934’s La Cucaracha,

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,610
The Trail of the Lonesome Pine,
and Robin Hood, all of which came out well

60
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,920
before the Wizard of Oz.

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:33,320
It’s easy enough to roughly copy the technology
that “Technicolored” the Wizard of Oz.

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,889
RGB split, color bath, mesh, repeat.

63
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,639
But the film strip processes are just part
of the story.

64
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,220
Lie #2: this scene?

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,650
It’s not going from a black and white world
to a color one.

66
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,880
The set was actually painted sepia-tone so
the same Technicolor process could be used

67
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,540
for the bright Oz reveal.

68
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,229
Today, it’s much easier.

69
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:05,150
I can draw a box with my hand and with a click,
black and white and color play together.

70
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,479
They even had techniques to do stuff like
this in the Oz days.

71
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,520
But the fact that they built a sepia house
shows how Technicolor’s technical limitations

72
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,979
shaped all color movies.

73
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,389
“This is one of the cameras that was used
to film

74
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,389
The Wizard of Oz.”

75
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:32,030
“It weighs 4 to 500 pounds, and these cameras
were bigger than ordinary motion picture cameras

76
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,590
because they had to run three strips of film
through them at any given time.”

77
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,639
So remember — this scene?

78
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,220
That had to be done with this beast of a camera.

79
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,620
Those three strips didn’t just require more
space, they needed tons of light.

80
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,110
That set had to be blazingly overlit to get
enough light through to these three strips

81
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,110
of film.

82
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,380
The set was reportedly 100 degrees Fahrenheit
at times.

83
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,590
Sound was an issue, too.

84
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,280
“It’s so loud when you’re running three
strips of film through a camera, so they had

85
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,020
to build this blimp around it.

86
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,030
It’s filled with soundproofing material
so when you’re making a sound film you don’t

87
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,870
get all the sound from the camera throughout
the studio there.”

88
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,139
Technicolor’s advantages outweighed its
limitations.

89
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:15,770
It’s main advantage was the way in which
it could capture the tone of a scene.

90
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,379
Two movies made in the same year could have
a different look, not just because of the

91
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,110
choices made in front of the camera.

92
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,300
Technicolor consultants and directors tweaked
the palette of the film by adjusting the cyan,

93
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,930
magenta and yellow dyes.

94
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,660
The complicated dye transfer process gave
Singin’ in the Rain some of its magenta-hued

95
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,629
skin and deep saturated colors.

96
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,240
The film and technology weren’t the only
things that gave Technicolor movies their

97
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,319
distinctive look.

98
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,810
It also shaped the world that they chose to
film.

99
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,789
Lie #3: This isn’t the real Dorothy.

100
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:54,220
It’s Judy Garland’s body double.

101
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,000
She wore specially designed clothes and makeup
to match the sepia world, so Judy Garland

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,330
could swoop in, in the same shot and
a blue dress, to join Technicolor Oz.

103
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,430
These movies, and Oz, were shaped around Technicolor’s
abilities, from head to toe.

104
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,940
“The second page that you see here is the
part of the script that shows the ruby slippers

105
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,099
being unveiled, but what it shows is that
they were still silver shoes at this point,

106
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:25,050
but the producers of the film really wanted
to show off that Technicolor that they were

107
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,610
paying for, so they wanted them to be sparkly
ruby slippers that would look good against

108
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,610
the yellow brick road.

109
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,229
So they changed it at the middle of production
to ruby slippers.”

110
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,000
Today, the shoes are kept under low light
to preserve them, but during the shoot they

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,729
were blasted with light to accommodate the
camera and make those sequins sparkle.

112
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:46,300
These weren’t just on-set decisions — Technicolor
was always pulling strings behind the curtains.

113
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,289
Look at the credits for Wizard of Oz,

114
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:53,240
and The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, and A
Star is Born, and so on and so on.

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,319
You’ll see one name over and over.

116
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,789
Natalie Kalmus.

117
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,069
Once married to Technicolor cofounder Herb
Kalmus, she ruled with an iron fist over

118
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,419
Technicolor productions for many of the early
years.

119
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,849
Kalmus had over 300 film credits where she
gave Technicolor advice — and sometimes

120
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:14,639
told directors what to do.

121
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,860
This is the IMDB page for a woman born in
1882.

122
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:27,180
In 
documents like “Color Consciousness,”

123
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,479
she extended her reach into art — the essay
includes aesthetic color theory.

124
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,390
“Red: danger, blood, life, heat.

125
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,289
Green: Nature, outdoors, freedom, freshness.”

126
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:47,270
Kalmus’s influence was significant, but
it’s as important as a reflection of Technicolor’s

127
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,270
power.

128
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,950
Technicolor had its own processing facilities,
and its own camera crew that continued Natalie

129
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,670
Kalmus’ work after she left the company.

130
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,950
The technology and the production process
gave Technicolor a significant competitive

131
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,930
advantage to alternatives being used.

132
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,160
Despite all those alternatives shown on Barbara
Flueckiger’s website, studios stuck with

133
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,000
Technicolor for a long time.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,760
It had a reliable system and
could be shown in any theatre in splendid

135
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,339
color, without requiring special equipment.

136
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:23,560
Technicolor eventually fell to cheaper processes
through the 1950s, like Eastman Color, that

137
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,610
used a single strip.

138
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,790
The Godfather, Part II was one of the final
major releases to use the Technicolor we recognize.

139
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,540
But old prints remain surprisingly vibrant
today due to the dye transfer process used.

140
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,740
Today, I can snap my fingers and be in
The Matrix or in Stranger Things’ Upside

141
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,860
Down.

142
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,980
Ok.

143
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,390
What are all these dust particles?

144
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,390
Is this asbestos?

145
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,850
Am I covered in asbestos right now?

146
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,050
Technicolor was never just a click —
the look was formed by the camera’s strengths

147
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,180
and weaknesses, the artistic choices made
for color, and the Technicolor company’s

148
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,350
infrastructure and supervision.

149
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,941
In that key scene from the Wizard of Oz, you
might not have known the trivia about Dorothy’s

150
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:14,510
double, or the sepia doorway, or even that
it wasn’t Technicolor’s debut.

151
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,259
But one thing is easy to understand, intuitively.

152
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,740
The movie is all about it.

153
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,130
Technicolor wasn’t a switch or a doorway.

154
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:36,310
It was a whole world, just waiting on the
other side.

155
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,920
You can nerd out a lot more on Technicolor
by checking out Barbara Flueckiger’s website,

156
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,190
or Eastman House, which was really generous
with their time and a lot of the images that

157
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,190
you saw in this video.

158
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,070
I’ve linked both of those below.

159
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,410
You can see the director’s commentary for
this video in an additional video that we’ve

160
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,019
made where I share some behind-the-scenes
