00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone thanks for joining us</font>

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,170
we're joined today by two guests from GE

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Boff the chief marketing officer</font>

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,760
and rusty<font color="#E5E5E5"> Irving chief engineer we're</font>

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> industrial</font>

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet basically the incorporation of</font>

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,190
digital into all the big machines that

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,199
run our world and the evolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,490
marketing which is in the midst of a

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,520
seismic shift right now so let's start

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,550
with the industrial Internet what is the

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,960
industrial<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet and why should</font>

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,640
normal people care about so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you the normal people care about it</font>

15
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,000
and then rusty is going to go a little

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,969
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> deeper if you will so maybe three</font>

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">four or five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago Henry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we sort of</font>

18
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,739
said look you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know GE has been about</font>

19
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,780
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we have this deep deep</font>

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,790
heritage and manufacturing but the

21
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,559
future is going to be about making and

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,110
connecting machines big iron meets big

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,360
data if you will and we kind of helped

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,030
coin this term industrial internet the

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of really big things and this</font>

26
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,260
is the future of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company I mean this</font>

27
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,469
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a major pivot for us we've got as I</font>

28
00:00:58,469 --> 00:00:59,550
think you and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about before</font>

29
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a big group of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in san ramon</font>

30
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,349
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a thousand people in san</font>

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,049
ramon we opened maybe three weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,330
sort of mini version of san ramon a

33
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,939
foundry in Paris will have one in Boston

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our new headquarters we're hiring</font>

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,840
software engineers and computer

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,540
scientists because we you know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,950
the industrial Internet is new you'll

38
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,450
hear this from rusty is all about

39
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,670
driving outcomes for our customers so

40
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,650
you know rusty all I'll turn to you to

41
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,210
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of help dimensionalize this a</font>

42
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,460
little bit right and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know consumers</font>

43
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,930
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very familiar with the internet we</font>

44
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">watched through the 90s up through today</font>

45
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,560
how you went from you know very static

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,540
pages to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about products</font>

47
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,549
to being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to purchase products to</font>

48
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,710
today having proc products recommended

49
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,720
to you will all interconnected we have

50
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,490
many channels to interact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

51
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,070
other all digital so now all of a sudden

52
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,350
industrial<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is replace kind of</font>

53
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,750
the people as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject matter with</font>

54
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,630
things or our industrial machines except

55
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,159
that you need a much more heavyweight

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,810
type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

57
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,270
because the data is much more enormous

58
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,340
much greater<font color="#CCCCCC"> in size and much more</font>

59
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,219
complex to understand so with the advent

60
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,990
of cloud computing is really

61
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,459
one of the trends that enabled us to

62
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,440
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of it and build something</font>

63
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,270
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavyweight enough for us to</font>

64
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,400
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> an internet for our assets and</font>

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,959
make them work better for customers so

66
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,760
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifics so you make</font>

67
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,950
the engines that power<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Dreamliner</font>

68
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new Boeing plans that everybody</font>

69
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,319
loves they're all industrial<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

70
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,239
eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> too they're filled with sensors</font>

71
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,420
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do how does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that help</font>

72
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,980
sure so you know even at the most basic

73
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,709
level we take three parameters for each

74
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,450
of those engines and we can take many

75
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,670
more but just with the basic parameters

76
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,310
of exhaust gas temperature fuel flow in

77
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,110
core speed we're able to just take

78
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,120
measurements throughout the flight look

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,130
at them trend them and understand the

80
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,110
health of each<font color="#CCCCCC"> and every engine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

81
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,819
like you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the doctor may take your</font>

82
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,260
temperature of blood pressure and

83
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,670
they're a great indicator of how you're

84
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,799
doing we trend that we learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

85
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,080
engines when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment them and then</font>

86
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows us to advise our customers</font>

87
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,580
had it get more out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them how to fly</font>

88
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in ways in which they last longer</font>

89
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,299
and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to predict how much life</font>

90
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,220
they have so you can schedule when they

91
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,690
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over wing for me which</font>

92
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,250
saves them a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you get</font>

93
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,579
advance warning of problems yeah they're

94
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,650
one of the locomotives is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

95
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,290
where the heavy of weight nature of what

96
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,239
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really matters taking in</font>

97
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,190
massive amounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information and</font>

98
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,810
looking at maybe the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two</font>

99
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">anomalies you're seeing you can start</font>

100
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,470
the postulate is that a trend we should

101
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,480
be concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know one of the</font>

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that's actually happened to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

103
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">planet in the last 10 to 15 years is</font>

104
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,310
something called the dust belt we have

105
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">these particulate matter in the</font>

106
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,100
atmosphere in certain parts or the

107
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,350
engines that fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> through that don't last</font>

108
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,510
quite as long as on the ones that don't

109
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,430
fly through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're able to spot</font>

110
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,620
those trends much earlier and be able to

111
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">treat the engines before any real</font>

112
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,370
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> are honored one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the concepts</font>

113
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,639
and rain that we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> on is the</font>

114
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the advantage of having no unplanned</font>

115
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,900
downtime and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're operating in</font>

116
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,780
industry unfound unplanned downtime is a

117
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,000
bad thing that's kind of your animate

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,920
right so a lot of what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

119
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,049
drive with the industrial<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet you</font>

120
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,400
know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about GE is a digital</font>

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,590
industrial company is to help our

122
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,680
customers manage their their their

123
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">downtime their assets and the amount of</font>

124
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,639
time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're operational</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a much</font>

125
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,649
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient way and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so is this</font>

126
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:20,810
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

127
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,450
folks who fly just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all of us can</font>

128
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">look forward to in fewer delays fewer</font>

129
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,200
surprises fewer notification with the

130
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,760
cockpit oh we've just discovered that

131
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the engine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> broken and we need the TV</font>

132
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,870
team to come fix it right we've all

133
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,280
probably been on playing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least once</font>

134
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,630
if you fly a lot and all of a sudden

135
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">just about the time you think you're</font>

136
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,290
leaving the gate the pilot comes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

137
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,610
tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> you they got a light</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on or</font>

138
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,200
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

139
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,910
reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of times that happens</font>

140
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,100
tremendously on and you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

141
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,950
affects consumers right um you know it

142
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,600
will lower their fuel consumption for

143
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,010
instance right so should be able to

144
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">offer more competitive pricing on on</font>

145
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,290
tickets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linda you mentioned it to</font>

146
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">build out this business and incorporated</font>

147
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,400
in everything that she does you actually

148
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,370
opened a huge new division in Silicon

149
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,800
Valley you had an advertisement that

150
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,330
went along with it that everybody like

151
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,340
where the engineer announces to his

152
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,080
friends that he works for GE and it's

153
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,669
not why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ever do that while</font>

154
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:14,930
it's actually exciting and I work on

155
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,990

piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I mean are we now going to</font>

157
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,290
expect airlines to know how to interpret

<font color="#CCCCCC">them well i would say in you know rusty</font>

160
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">old jump in here you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think for GE</font>

161
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,600
we're 124 years old 124 year old stored

162
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,729
up if you will and people know us well

163
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,860
they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us a certain way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

164
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,150
as we have added<font color="#CCCCCC"> this whole layer of</font>

165
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,860
analytics predictive analytics data

166
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,890
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public if you will from a</font>

167
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,720
brand point of view think of us as a

168
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,669
company that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this hybrid of digital</font>

169
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,160
and industrial is important talent is a

170
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,100
big piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that so the fun campaign</font>

171
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,800
you referred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a developer</font>

172
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,200
sort of telling his perplexed friends

173
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,870
that he now works for GE well it's light

174
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,180
and it's marketing there's a there's a

175
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,500
truth to it which is we are now bringing

176
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,090
hundreds now thousands of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to work</font>

177
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">for GE in a completely new capacity and</font>

178
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,889
that leads to a new type of behavior I

179
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,690
mean rusty you might talk a little bit

180
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,760
about what you do is in the digital twin

181
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,710
because that's a piece of this sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

182
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,110
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in to the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to about you</font>

183
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,500
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> our starting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a brand new</font>

184
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,479
division of GE GE digital based in San

185
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,770
monona yes we had a ghost somewhere

186
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,720
and really dip into that ecosystem and

187
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,180
find the digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> talent what makes us so</font>

188
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,129
powerful in this is that we've married

189
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,830
it with our legacy industrial know how

190
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,930
you know the deep physics knowledge that

191
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,280
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about these machines and when</font>

192
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,080
you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things together it's a</font>

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,840
very powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so one of the work</font>

194
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,180
on one of our killer apps built on top

195
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the industrial internet there's</font>

196
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,599
something we call the digital twin so

197
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,430
for every one of these aircraft engines

198
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,680
or local motors<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we make will also</font>

199
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,599
have its digital torn think of it as the

200
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know medical record of that asset so</font>

201
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,639
we track it as it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> through its</font>

202
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifecycle from when it was built and</font>

203
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,229
commissioned to how it operates and

204
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,210
again using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data that we get off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

205
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and the physics models that we have</font>

206
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed about that we can have very</font>

207
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,539
unique insights nobody else is able to

208
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,690
calculate again to tell how to get more

209
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of the asset and again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reduce that</font>

210
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">down time and how is how unusual is what</font>

211
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,169
you're doing relative everybody else

212
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,909
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the outside listening to</font>

213
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,219
lots of big manufacturing companies so

214
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,870
that everyone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about digital as</font>

215
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,539
the next thing cloud cloud cloud is what

216
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,520
you're doing where is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

217
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,550
competitive so you know there are very

218
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,199
few companies in fact I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font>

219
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,479
singular in this way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

220
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,050
domain expertise right we know industry

221
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,330
we have been an industry for over a

222
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,729
century we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking that knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

223
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">industry and adding the data component</font>

224
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:58,500
and frankly Henry<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying it on</font>

225
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,479
ourselves I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first several years</font>

226
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">of industrial Internet has been GE</font>

227
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,029
applying the technology that rusty and I

228
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,009
are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to our own factories</font>

229
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,130
and our<font color="#CCCCCC"> own machines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of rare</font>

230
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,039
in this world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody with our</font>

231
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,110
type of expertise can add that layer

232
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,539
sort of practice it on ourselves before

233
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,449
we introduce it to customers so you know

234
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:24,120
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as sort of a you know our</font>

235
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,729
industrial<font color="#E5E5E5"> superpowers meeting data and</font>

236
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:29,250
analytics you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you know I really</font>

237
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,500
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as we've been doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

238
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,750
this for over 30 years we have started

239
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build medical monitoring and</font>

240
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,309
diagnostic centres decades ago where we

241
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,070
do watch these assets with the data we

242
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,099
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect</font>

243
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,290
now we have more sensors more data more

244
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,779
know how about what to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it again</font>

245
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:49,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the capacity though that you get</font>

246
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,790
from cloud computing allows us to do

247
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this at a completely different scale so</font>

248
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">we think what really makes us much more</font>

249
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,420
unique than anybody else doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

250
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,430
the fact that we've built<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

251
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,649
platform fall for it called predicts

252
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:05,259
right this is GES industrial internet

253
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,420
platform sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

254
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,970
operating system for industry you know

255
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,029
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build industrial apps we</font>

256
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to build them on critics</font>

257
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,269
we're doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ourselves and we're</font>

258
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,790
offering it to the world in fact

259
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,610
Microsoft I think this morning is making

260
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,319
an announcement they'll be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

261
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:26,350
so you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are seeing an uptick in</font>

262
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,199
adoption to have an operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> system and</font>

263
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:30,639
operating system<font color="#CCCCCC"> of industry is a great</font>

264
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,130
way to say it that is super strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

265
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,389
know we sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> say industrial strength</font>

266
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:36,310
strength that can hold literally

267
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,000
petabytes of data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has you know</font>

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">cyber security as sort of a number one</font>

269
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,920
feature you know we take so seriously I

270
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean you talked about jet engines before</font>

271
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:50,410
on this is data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be ironclad</font>

272
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,589
secure so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've sort of have</font>

273
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:55,240
the right to do it we have the knowledge

274
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,920
and we've been practicing it ourselves

275
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,230
and you've talked about this being a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

276
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">year plan to build that change GE and go</font>

277
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:04,029
forward we're in year three or four

278
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,370
where are we in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

279
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like not just for GE but for the</font>

280
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,839
machines themselves I mean what's that

281
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">future look like it's an interesting</font>

282
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,560
landscape to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of portray a little</font>

283
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,870
bit right well i think you know we move

284
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,579
from where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are today we have already</font>

285
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">built 35,000 twins of our assets and i</font>

286
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,670
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in that you know the</font>

287
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,420
times family meeting to full realization

288
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,220
will be millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and millions of people</font>

289
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">with digital kings built without</font>

290
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,389
technology to track their assets and

291
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:36,730
there'll be a whole you know continuum

292
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,220
of will build some of them for them

293
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll offer our digital twin and</font>

294
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,069
predicts a capability as a platform as a

295
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,870
service so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

296
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,029
sophistication as a developer you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

297
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:51,050
it yourself or we can you can unless the

298
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,120
for you and as many<font color="#E5E5E5"> options of how it's</font>

299
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,310
hosted but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think just like we saw on</font>

300
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,260
the web right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never imagined the</font>

301
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,540
number of cell phones right I think this

302
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,070
will go way<font color="#E5E5E5"> beyond</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wildest dreams</font>

303
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in the first you know four or so</font>

304
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,480
years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this we've hit every</font>

305
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,670
metric we set out for ourselves and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

306
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,019
we started they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have looked a</font>

307
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,820
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy to us but we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it</font>

308
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,440
and I'm confident we'll get all the way

309
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the ankle and have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to</font>

310
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,589
do things for customers that you didn't

311
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,269
foresee in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning because if you</font>

312
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:18,800
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the iphone for example when this</font>

313
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,769
was first introduced everyone made all

314
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:23,180
these crazy predictions and it turned

315
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,769
out they weren't anywhere near crazy

316
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,540
enough and all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things have been</font>

317
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,490
created that nobody imagined them well I

318
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">think if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can jump in on this one I</font>

319
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">think what's really interesting is just</font>

320
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,810
in some ways like iOS and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

321
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,269
Apple phone you know predicts is a

322
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,360
platform and we expect you know maybe

323
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,870
ten twenty thousand developers this year

324
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,870
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> building apps on predicts so you</font>

325
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,490
know we've got four or five thousand

326
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,050
already and I think that's where the

327
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,450
flywheel starts to starts to happen

328
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,060
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great platform developers</font>

329
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,920
industrial developers looking at this

330
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,560
and saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow I can apply what i know</font>

331
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,350
and create industrial solutions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

332
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,360
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start to you know</font>

333
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,980
make a big difference as the apps come

334
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,370
online<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean there are predictions that</font>

335
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,200
the industrial internet will be bigger

336
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">than the consumer internet hard to</font>

337
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,980
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just data but in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

338
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,200
in terms of the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market and</font>

339
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,709
frankly in terms of the impact we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

340
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,029
about marketing let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

341
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:26,270
marketing the chief marketing all most

342
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,130
innovative marketing companies so

343
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,399
stepping back yeah well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 year</font>

344
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,079
period five years ago 25 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

345
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,699
future yeah can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us a sense of</font>

346
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,040
what's happening to GES marketing and

347
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,430
add budget yeah so look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

348
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,560
Henry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you and I have had</font>

349
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this conversation at various points to</font>

350
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,660
market in the year we live at we don't

351
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of pine for the good old days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

352
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,190
there were three networks and it was

353
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,560
easy to reach people what we try to do

354
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,370
in marketing is to get the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

355
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,620
content message out where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

356
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,290
spending their time and as a result you

357
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">know do people still watch television</font>

358
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,900
you bet they do however in our opinion

359
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,360
where we might place advertising is a

360
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,490
lot different than it used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be because</font>

361
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,580
of binge watching because of DVR so

362
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,640
we've shifted most of our television<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad</font>

363
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">spent to be during live programming</font>

364
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,360
sunday night football is a good example

365
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,050
of that and our digital spend is just

366
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,990
increasing percentage wise and you know

367
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,730
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have something like Facebook</font>

368
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to make this a</font>

369
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook commercial but you know</font>

370
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook is the most efficient place to</font>

371
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,170
reach people on it's as much a

372
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,810
performance channel as it is a social

373
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel Google's really efficient and</font>

374
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,100
then you know us we love to experiment

375
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,500
you know we've experimented as a company

376
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,180
and as a business all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

377
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,000
Edison so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue that spirit of</font>

378
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,440
experimenting when it comes to our

379
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,930
marketing and that might be on doing a

380
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,750
podcast which we did last fall that was

381
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,880
terrific called the message or VR or

382
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,580
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being on an emerging platforms so</font>

383
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,610
as I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about marketing and trends</font>

384
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,960
those are those are a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> that come</font>

385
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,880
to my facebooks made no secret of its

386
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,070
desire to capture a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> percentage of</font>

387
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,240
television dollars here we are talking

388
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,620
funnily in our area what's the unit when

389
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,650
you buy when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you replace television and</font>

390
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,750
on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook what's the unit so</font>

391
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,600
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great question on I think of</font>

392
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,930
the unit as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tension right so we all</font>

393
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,450
want attention and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think when there</font>

394
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,850
were three networks for networks you got

395
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,000
attention simply by being on friends or

396
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,880
cheers or something like that on as we

397
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,670
all strive for attention attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

398
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,430
think is more and more in people's feeds

399
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,080
think about the amount of time that

400
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,030
we're on our phones and think about

401
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,710
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on our phones you know</font>

402
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,960
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows fewer and fewer apps are</font>

403
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,660
being used the apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are used are</font>

404
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,960
frequently<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones Facebook Linkedin etc</font>

405
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,270
where you're putting videos hopefully

406
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,950
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are watching us right now on</font>

407
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook live in stream but I think</font>

408
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,580
despite all the metrics available to you

409
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,130
know cider to GE

410
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,880
the the most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is our people</font>

411
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually engaging with us that's the</font>

412
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,290
unit i want to buy what are you

413
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,150
producing to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

414
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific sir there's been a lot written</font>

415
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,040
about basically add<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea people are ya</font>

416
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,260
have especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the younger generations</font>

417
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,840
don't like ads so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's</font>

418
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,030
happening is this co-creation<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yelp</font>

419
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,770
content yep you've been at the forefront

420
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,720
of that you actually created a TV series

421
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,750
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> with National Geographic dead so</font>

422
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,790
what did what is the ad unit look like

423
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,890
of the future is going to be a 30-second

424
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,360
spot is it going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a pre-roll which</font>

425
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,920
a lot of people don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes is it</font>

426
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,660
going to be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which you are</font>

427
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,730
featured that is a story created by

428
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,000
producer how do you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

429
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,420
think any and all of the above<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

430
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,630
possible but it comes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

431
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,170
quality high enough you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

432
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,640
off and again you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I have talked</font>

433
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past you know you</font>

434
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,470
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to create content that is</font>

435
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,060
second fiddle you want to create

436
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really good story</font>

437
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,050
that can be six<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours which is what we</font>

438
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,970
did with national geo it can be six

439
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,160
seconds which we've done on vine it can

440
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,860
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Instagram it can be a podcast and I</font>

441
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,310
tend to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the unit and now here</font>

442
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,410
where you're going on this can be

443
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,750
integrated so when we did this podcast

444
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,460
last fall on we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very loosely</font>

445
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,300
part of the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> very loosely but what</font>

446
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,940
we surrounded it with was this idea of

447
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,420
the GE podcast<font color="#CCCCCC"> theater and it's funny it</font>

448
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,460
kind of harkens back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 50s where</font>

449
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,130
there was once<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon a time the GE</font>

450
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,990
theater and there were soap operas

451
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,000
brought to you by consumer packaged

452
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,150
goods goods companies so sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

453
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,459
creating a franchise and in some ways

454
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,530
what we did with podcasting this one

455
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,569
podcast what we did with nat geo was

456
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,030
kind of a franchise position but make no

457
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,160
mistake there are times when we will

458
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,349
create something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks and smells</font>

459
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,689
and behaves like an ad<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it's</font>

460
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,119
really good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we talked</font>

461
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,650
about a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes ago because you</font>

462
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,849
brought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

463
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,160
sheepish bringing it up this series we

464
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,189
did on this young<font color="#CCCCCC"> developer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh n was a</font>

465
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:29,450
great story it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sell</font>

466
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,120
deprecating it was funny and recruiting

467
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,929
went up eight hundred percent so you

468
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,570
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find that bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of magic</font>

469
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,510
and it is a bit of magic right on you

470
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,309
know that can be very powerful so I

471
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,490
guess my<font color="#E5E5E5"> long answer to your smart</font>

472
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,779
question is that the unit will vary but

473
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,440
it will not be one single<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pre-roll</font>

474
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,840
it's not pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll on I think it's</font>

475
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to come in a lot of forms and</font>

476
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,690
formats so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back as the last</font>

477
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,880
question yeah one over the next five

478
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,159
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see your spending</font>

479
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,919
shifting does it go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook TV to</font>

480
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,299
Facebook is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple way to think</font>

481
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it well I I think that's it's</font>

482
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,740
that's almost too simple if you will

483
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,409
more is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to facebook but or spend</font>

484
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,720
will go where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are spending their</font>

485
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,720
time and attention look if every single

486
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,330
person in<font color="#E5E5E5"> America was watching ABC we'd</font>

487
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,429
be on ABC but every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> person isn't</font>

488
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,649
a billion and a half people are on

489
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,690
Facebook and I think for any marketer

490
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,029
that ignores where people are spending

491
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,980
their time they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at their own</font>

492
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,289
peril so our spend will shift as

493
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,049
people's behavior shifts and digital is

494
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:44,269
only going up so that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

495
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">harbinger for where our spend will go</font>

496
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,350
