with all the weed trucks and imagery all over New York these days you might think to yourself hey is marijuana legal now not quite what these companies are selling is actually something called CBD it's found in everything from lollipops to lattes and business is booming CBD products are part of what is estimated to be a roughly 1 billion dollar industry in the United States and it's perfectly legal so what does CBD have that marijuana doesn't back to the matter is were kind of in the midst of the CBD craze right now Martin Lee is the director of project CBD an educational platform that focuses on cannabis science and therapeutics CB d stands for cannabidiol that's a component of the cannabis plant that has significant therapeutic properties but it's not intoxicating it doesn't get you high like a THC as it happens not all cannabis plants are created equal take a look at these two varieties one is marijuana the other is hemp one gets you high the other doesn't the key difference is what's on the inside THC and CBD are the main components of the cantaloupe THC is what makes you feel high and marijuana plants are loaded with it hemp on the other hand has hardly any THC at all but what it lacks in THC it makes up for with higher amounts of CBD now CBD won't get you high but it does have a redeeming quality it's legal and at least according to the marketing it has a relaxing effect so since this stuff is all the rage let's see how it's made so once you have a cannabis plant one simple way to make extract can be done in your own kitchen as simple as using olive oil or butter and heating the trim from the plant a little bit of the green material from the plant obviously that's not very useful for mass industrial production - to be cooking up something in your kitchen with butter and cannabis but the more common way involves a specialized complex a machine one very widespread way is using what's called a supercritical co2 extraction it's ground up to be to have the texture initially of like a coffee grind and it's it's poured into vessels literally of a supercritical co2 machine it will stay in that machine for upwards to 24 hours under different pressures and temperatures at different times of the extraction process and ultimately you'll end up with a thick golden oil that's very waxy and texture you can also extract it using ethanol and hydrocarbons you can find this oil in a number of different products these days it can be administered in various different forms it might be ingested it might be applied topically they even have CBD oil products for your pets I stopped by a cafe in New York which sells all sorts of CBD infused products I tried a CBD matcha latte and a CBD macaron these snacks tasted great and I felt a little more relaxed after but it was hard to tell if the CBD was actually doing anything for me or if it was all in my head scientists are actually still trying to figure out exactly how CBD affects the body so there really is a scientific basis for understanding why CBD can work but we're still really a long way of mastering the house still CBD may have more benefits than just the relaxing afternoon some initial studies have shown that CBD can help with a number of different medical conditions in fact in June 2018 the FDA approved the first CBD drug epidemics which is used to treat epilepsy so who knows perhaps we'll be seeing CBD in more places than just cannabis decorated vans in the future you
