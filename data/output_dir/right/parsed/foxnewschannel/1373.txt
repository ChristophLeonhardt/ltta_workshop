WARSAW SAYS IT IS COMMITTED TO
SHARING THE BURDEN OF THE
DEFENSE SPENDING WITH THE
UNITED STATES.
>> Arthel: AS THE NATION
OBSERVES MEMORIAL DAY I'D LIKE
TO INTEREST MY GUEST.
CAROL WAS A DRIVER IN IRAQ IN
THE MID-2000s.
IN THAT TIME SHE HAD TO FEND
OFF A SEXUAL ASSAULT.
NOW SHE ADVOCATES FOR
AMERICANS TAKING CARE OF THE
MENTAL HEALTH WHEN THEY COME
BACK FROM COMBAT.
KARA LYDY TELLS THE STORY PART
OF THE "THIS IS WAR" PODCAST
SET TO BE RELEASED WEDNESDAY.
AND JOIN US NOW.
HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE.
>> HELLO.
>> Arthel: KARA, WHAT WOULD
YOU SAY THE MAIN PART OF THE
REMARKABLE STORY THAT YOU WANT
TO SHARE IN THE PODCAST.
>> THE THING FOR ME BIGGEST
PART OF SHARING MY STORY IS
THE RELATABILITY THAT ANYBODY
ELSE MIGHT HAVE.
FOR ME, COMING OUT OF THE
MILITARY YOU COME HOME TO A
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ARE BEEN
THERE.
SO FOR ME TO SHARE THE
INTIMATE DETAILS OF THE
EXPERIENCES IS MY HOPE THAT
WHOEVER HEARS IT KNOWS THAT
THEY HAVE HOPE AND THEY ARE
NOT ALONE.
IN WHAT WAYS DO YOU FEEL IT
HAS BEEN THE MOST CHALLENGING
FOR PEOPLE TO BE IT YOUR
FAMILY OR YOUR FRIENDS, THE
PEOPLE YOU SEE AT THE GROCERY
STORE TO RELATE TO YOU POST
COMBAT?
>> POST COMBAT, I KNOW
VETERANS WERE STUCK IN THE
MINDS.
WE WERE TRAINED TO DO THINGS A
CERTAIN WAY AND THEN TO ASK
FOR HELP IS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS
WHEN YOU ARE ACTIVE.
SO WHEN YOU COME HOME YOU
ALMOST DON'T KNOW HOW TO
VOCALIZE THAT WITH THE PEOPLE
YOU ARE CLOSE TO.
ESPECIALLY YOUR FAMILY AND
YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOU KNEW
BEFORE.
ESSENTIALLY TO THEM IT'S TWO
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
THE PERSON THEY KNEW BEFORE
YOU DEPLOYED VERSUS THE PERSON
THAT COMES HOME.
>> Arthel: WELL, THERE IS
CERTAINLY NOTHING WEAK ABOUT
WHAT IT IS ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE
DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO.
HOW CHALLENGING IS IT TO CARE,
FOR YOU TO CARE FOR THE
RETURNING COMBAT VETS?
DO YOU ASSIST THEIR FAMILIES
AS WELL?
>> BASICALLY, I HAVE KEPT UP
AN OUTREACH WITH THE NUMEROUS
PEOPLE I SERVE WITH OR ANYONE
I MET AFTER THE SERVICE.
THAT THE RET RANS.
WE DIDN'T -- THAT THE VETERANS
AND THAT WE DIDN'T SERVE
TOGETHER.
I MAKE IT A POINT TO LET THEM
KNOW THEY HAVE OPTIONS.
IT COULD BE A FRIEND.
SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF.
I WOULD BE THE FAMILY, THE
LOVED ONES THE SPOUSE.
REACHING OUT TO THE V.A. IF
THEY HAVE THE BENEFITS AND
GOING THAT ROUTE OR PRIVATE
CARE.
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO COME
HOME FROM OVERSEAS AND BEING
DEPLOYED IS KNOWING THEY HAVE
THINGS IN PLACE TO GO TO IF
THEY NEED IT.
>> Arthel: WHERE DO YOU FIND
YOUR PERSONAL STRENGTH?
>> I THINK I FOUND MY PERSONAL
STRENGTH IN MY FAMILY,
ESPECIALLY.
THE PEOPLE THAT STOOD BY ME
SINCE I HAVE COME HOME.
WITH MY VETERAN FAMILY IT'S
NICE TO KNOW YOU CAN PICK UP
THE PHONE SIX YEARS AFTER NOT
SEEING SOMEBODY AND SAY HEY,
YOU HAVE TIME TO LISTEN?
AND THEY DO.
THAT IS LEAPS AND BOUNDS AS
FAR AS PROGRESS.
FOR ME THAT I WHAT I HOLD NEAR
AND DEAR TO MY HEART, KNOWING
THE DOOR IS OPEN WITH THOSE
PEOPLE.
>> Arthel: IS THERE A
MESSAGE IN PARTICULAR YOU'D
LIKE TO SEND TO OUR VIEWERS ON
MANY MEMORIAL MEM -- ON THIS MEM
MANY MEMORIAL MEM -- ON THIS MER
MANY MEMORIAL MEM -- ON THIS MEA
MANY MEMORIAL MEM -- ON THIS MEL
DAY WEEKEND?
>> I'D LIKE TO SAY MEMORIAL
DAY IS A TIME OF REMEMBRANCE
BUT IT IS ALSO A TIME TO HUG
THE ONES YOU LOVE TO BE
THANKFUL FOR HAVING THE
FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL
THE THINGS WE DO FOR MEMORIAL
DAY.
IT'S MORE THAN COOKING OUT AND
HAVING FUN.
YOU KNOW, TAKE A MOMENT TO
REALIZE THE SACRIFICE IT TOOK
FOR US TO HAVE WHAT WE HAVE.
>> Arthel: KARA LYDY, I
CAN'T IMAGINE THE SACRIFICE.
I THANK YOU FOR MYSELF AND FOR
ALL OF US HERE AT FOX AND FOR
ALL OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS.
YOU ARE A HERO INDEED.
AND CONTINUED SUCCESS AND
CONTINUED HEALTH AND RECOVERY
