I'm not planning to get involved in many elections now that I don't have to run for office again but the French election is very important to the future of France and the values that we care so much about I have admired the campaign that Emmanuel macron has won he has stood up for liberal values he put forward a vision for the important role that France plays in Europe and around the world and he is committed to a better future for the French people he appeals to people's hopes and not their fears and I enjoyed speaking the manual recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France I know that you face many challenges and I want all of my friends in France to know how much I am rooting for your success because of how important this election is I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel macron to lead you forward on mush vive la France the polls say you can't win really yes they also said that breakfast wasn't going to happen the Donald Trump wasn't going to be elected wasn't even going to be his party's nominee follow the bus judge as well they're saying that less and less now they are much more cautious much more cautious poodle
