I'm sorry somebody has to say it maybe we do need a boarder in Ireland and maybe the reason why is illegal immigration I'm sorry I know it's a difficult one I'm not saying necessarily we have to have a border in Ireland but I am saying maybe we do need one maybe we need to talk about it maybe we need to talk about the possibility of actually having a border I know a lot of people in Ireland don't want it but I mean let's face it the place is already divided ideologically and now it's divided because of pregs it and there's no point with reversing on bravely because it means overturning the Democratic mandate of that decision it over - it would overturn everything but this really are reasons why we should look at the possibility of having some kind of border maybe it's a wall maybe it's people standing at the border maybe it's some kind of controls but there's a video I saw today an investigation from the BBC who from who he does a really good work here and they found that cross channel migrants are gaining gaining access to the UK via the Republic of Ireland the BBC reported on a story of smugglers taking an illegal immigrant from northern France the smugglers then drove the immigrant to Paris here he boarded a flight to Dublin he then used a real Greek passport that he obtained illegally from somebody who looked like him he handed this back to the smugglers once he reached Dublin and from there he went by bus to Belfast in Northern Ireland crossing the Irish border he then caught a ferry to Scotland and then a train to Glasgow which took him down to London so what we see is once you get to Northern Ireland it's fairly easy to get to Scotland just a quick ferry ride and then it's really easy to get back down into England now one of the reasons we voted brakes it was because of issues like this we wanted to manage our own borders illegal immigration is kind of a different issue entirely I suppose people are getting into the UK illegally through the the tunnel from Kerry to Dover but obviously people concerned about immigration if we leave the European Union and we don't maintain or create some kind of sensible border solution in Ireland then people are going to still be flooding in and people are going to be wondering well what was the point in voting what was the point we're trying to tell the government were concerned about immigration they still do nothing about it because by the looks of it the latest trend now is getting into the Republic of Ireland which people will be able to do through the European Union easily people cook people will enter the European Union through countries on the continent who are more lacs about their immigration rules people gain EU citizenship they therefore go to the Republic of Ireland easy the minute they're in the Republic of Ireland they just crossed the border get the ferry to Scotland and they've got a long journey down to England but it's easy they can do it something needs to be done here and I know it's a difficult situation but sometimes I'm just the bad guy sometimes it's just me who has to say these things too many times I've been the bogeyman for stuff like this but maybe once again I am gonna be the bogeyman and say it maybe we do need a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic now I saw an article from Daniel Hannan where he talks about the Swiss border shows free movement works perfectly well without the customs union he says Switzerland's border is crossed by around 2.4 million people every day and it's outside the customs union yet euro Files and Brussels are trying to prevent a similar deal in Ireland he went on to say it's true that there are both booths in places but they are mainly concerned with ensuring foreign vehicles of purchased Swiss Road discs the customs posts date from a time when exporters couldn't file the decorations online as Swiss borders cross by 2.4 million people across all figure for a country with a population of just 8.4 million yada-yada-yada and he goes on to talk about how Switzerland is outside that you use custom Union but I nobody wants to join it but they don't appear to be much in the way of border checks I remember when I drove from London to Switzerland and we were crossing through whichever country it was we went through before switch side was it France sorry my geography is bad I think it was friends and we were crossing through to Switzerland and I got my passport out as I'm driving went over a few speed bumps expected to go through a booth and hand it over nothing you just went straight through now maybe this border system works on a financial level and it does maybe this would work with whatever deal we end up striking with the European Union so Daniel Hannan as always is bang on the money he's right on the money side of things but what I'm concerned about is with no real checks at the border without a physical border or without at least some kind of checks with passports on routes where people will naturally go with their cars without some kind of surveillance people are going to cross the border every single day and people will be pouring in to get back into Britain pouring in as they have done for years and as our economy grows and as we do great after breaks it more people are wanting to come going to want to come more people are going to come to Ireland and more people are gonna cross that invisible border and enter the UK I'm sorry what can I say maybe we need a border in Northern Ireland if you want to see more from me and the rest of the
