I don't have to tell you how unhappy those those countries you just mentioned are with Trudeau calling these new tariffs insulting totally unacceptable Merkel says they are illegal you have McCrone who says we're not doing this thing is the potential payoff from negotiating better trade deals worth ripping these alliances apart in your view I don't think to use your words ripping these alliances apart is what's going on what we have you don't think in that direction well we have our leaders in these individual countries who are speaking to their own political base but they fully acknowledge they fully acknowledge that they're ripping this country off and what this is done what the president has done with his steel and aluminum tariffs what he's done with the threat of auto tariffs they're talking to us now I'm telling you six months ago they wouldn't even talk to us so this is the way the president works it's the art of the deal these countries have been having a great deal me look every year eight hundred billion dollars goes overseas in terms of a trade deficit that comes back with foreigners buying up this country and what president says that's not going to happen anymore let me ask you said I want to kind of do a little bit of a lightening around here Peter because I want to make sure I get all these topics that are - you're at number one try to keep up g7 does the president even want to be there well I think the president is very very focused on an issue which is far more important at this point in history which is the Singapore trip that's not that's why he's going if he didn't want to be there you know the president he wouldn't go Chile right well he's leaving early but he has a very good reason because that Singapore trip there's a lot riding on at Ford not just for the American people and the North Koreans it's for the world because North Korea yeah you know what the problem is there thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
