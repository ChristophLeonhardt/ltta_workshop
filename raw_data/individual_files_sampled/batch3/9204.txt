ADMINISTRATION DID NOTHING. I SHUT DOWN ZTE. NOW HE'S GOING TO REOPEN IT. NEIL NEI NEIL? Neil: JOHN ROBERTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THANKS VERY MUCH. AND NOW TO THE SUMMIT. CLAUDIA ROSETTE IS WITH US. YOU'RE CONCERN IS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE A LOT OF ABOUT FACING ON COMMITMENTS AND THING WOULDN'T BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME. EXACTLY. THE THING THAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME, PRESIDENT TRUMP INSTEAD OF THE USUAL U.S. DIPLOMATIC PRACTICE OF CHASING AFTER THEM, TRYING TO ENTICE THEM SAID OKAY, FINE. I'M CANCELLING THE SUMMIT. I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. Neil: SO IF THE SUMMIT IS BACK ON, WHAT WOULD CHANGE HERE? ESPECIALLY IF IT'S BACK ON FOR JUNE 12, WHICH EVERY DAY THAT GOES BUY MAKES THAT MORE PROBLEMATIC WHAT DO YOU THROUGH? YEAH, I'VE BEEN SKEPTICAL FROM THE BEGINNING THAT IT CAN ACHIEVE THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA BUT I THINK ACTUALLY THE WAY IT'S PLAYING OUT SO FAR HAS BEEN GOOD. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP CAUGHT THEM AS FAR AS THE KABOOKIE THEATER. I THINK HE CAUGHT THEM FLAT-FOOTED. THE COINCIDENCE THAT THEY WERE PUTTING ON THIS SHOW OF BLOWING UP THEIR APPARENTLY ALREADY DEFUNCT NUCLEAR TESTING SITE AS HE WAS RELEASING THE LETTER CANCELLING THE SUMMIT, I THOUGHT NORTH KOREA IS NO JOKE BUT THIS WAS ALMOST FUNNY. YOU NOTICE THEY HAVEN'T MADE A HUGE PROTEST OVER THAT. THEY KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT IT WAS AN EMPTY GESTURE. THEY WERE SORT OF OFFERING IT AS ONE MORE GIVE-AWAY TO US. IT WAS WORTH NOTHING. A GREAT DANGER IN NORTH KOREA. THE MORE THAT TRUMP GIVES THEM SOME OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE, THE BETTER I THINK THAT IS. STILL LEAVES US WITH A PROBLEM OF HOW DO WE STOP THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR THREAT. Neil: HOW DO WE? PEOPLE SAY ALL ROADS GO THROUGH CHINA. I DON'T THINK IT WAS ACCIDENTAL THAT THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO THE CHANGE IN POSTURE OF THE NORTH KOREANS POST KIM JONG-UN MEETING WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT THAT SOMETHING CHANGED SINCE THEN. MAYBE IT WAS A MORE BELLICOSE POSITION RECOMMENDED BY THE CHINESE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS THERE. BUT NOW WE HAVE THIS DEAL TO GET ZTE, THE CHINESE TELECOM CONCERN BACK ON THE TROUBLE. THAT MAYBE MEANS A TRADE CONCESSION IS COMING, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YEAH, I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN MORE TO THIS IN THE PUBLIC REALM. ZTE IS IMMESHED WITH THE BACK ROOM NEGOTIATIONS OF NORTH KOREA. I STILL WORRY ABOUT CHINESE BUYING. I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT ELECTRONICS. CHINA HAS PLANS THAT ARE NOT FRIENDLY TO US TO NEXT 30 YEARS. BY 2049, THEY WANT TO BE THE DOMINANT WORLD POWER. AS FAR AS NORTH KOREA, CHINA HAS NEVER BEEN OUR FRIEND. IN A WAY, CHINA IS NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR UMBRELLA. WOULD THEY GO TO WORE WITH US OVER NORTH KOREA? PROBABLY NOT. NORTH KOREA HAS HAD CHINA'S OKAY TO PURSUE NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR YEARS. CHINA COULD HAVE STOPPED THAT. THEY DID NOT. SO WHEN YOU READ THAT CHINA IS DISMAYED ABOUT THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, NO. THE REAL NUCLEAR POWER IS CHINA, AND RUSSIAN, BY THE WAY, THAT IS BUDDIES WITH NORTH KOREA. THERE'S BIGGER THREATS FURTHER OUT BUT MUCH BIGGER. CHINA I THINK USES NORTH KOREA AS A TEST CASE, THAT'S HOW YOU CAN PUSH THE ENVELOPE. NORTH KOREA HAS GONE TOO FAR FOR MANY YEARS TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE WORLD THAT IF YOU PLAY CHICKEN WITH THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL BACK DOWN. THAT'S THE DIFFICULT GAME THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO PLAY. WE CAN'T LET NORTH KOREA KEEP NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I DOUBT HE CAN SOLVE THIS DIPLOMATICALLY. IT MAY COME TO MILITARY ACTION. Neil: WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
