right now they're taking the weakest
smallest most frail animal they have
they can't eat a regular fish regimen so
they mash up and blend up basically a
fish smoothie they feed it to her via
stomach tube after that they put her the
pool let her calm down a little bit and
they give her her one fish ration for
the day yeah I got this thing I mera
little oh so she's basically still
learning how to eat fish yes I'm sorry I
can't watch this anymore yeah I know you
want your fish you can tell the animals
are really sick when you see as he lines
it up and I can't eat a little half a
fish oh it's pretty sad there we go
