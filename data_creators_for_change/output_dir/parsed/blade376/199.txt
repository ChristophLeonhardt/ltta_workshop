of birds and the trees outside and I was
just so annoyed and I thought you know
how would you like it if you got waked
up by our babies and then I made some
random comment to a friend of how weird

of babies crying in the trees instead of
birds don't ask me how am I trying to
thought works and last night I had a
dream guess what it was about I went to
a psychiatrist very friendly very
professional and then he told me some
good news and some bad news the good
news was yes mr. daya the dream you
speak of is quite a popular one and then
the bad news was it means you're a
pedophile there's 60 seconds of timber
