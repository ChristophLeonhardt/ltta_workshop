The tents, they were 
inside of the building.
Everyone chooses a space.
They made it like a house.
My name is Mirwaiz.
I’m from Afghanistan.
This is an old airport.
It’s used for refugees, 
as a camp.
The first time we arrived here,
the facility wasn’t good.
But step by step, Greek people, 
they helped us.
Help with clothes, foods.
We sleep in the airport, we are in the 
terminal of the airport.
But we can’t travel to any places.
I wish that one day my family and I 
could travel without any problems.
I mean not illegally, legally.
