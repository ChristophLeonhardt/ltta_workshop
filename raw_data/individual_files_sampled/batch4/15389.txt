I was taking journalism ethics I would fail right now really you would because you're talking to a bunch of 22 year old so and you're like what 50 I'll take it remember the good old days when everybody was either straight gay or bi well now the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario recognizes 15 different genders that's not just LGBTQ anymore folks it's LG G B D T TT i QQ a a P P and what does that stand for you might ask well I got to take a deep breath lesbian gay gay gender bisexual demisexual transgender transsexual two-spirit intersex queer questioning asexual allies pansexual and polyamorous and what do members of generation Trudeau after dark have to say about this gender bending business let's find out what we're asking ladies is that the elementary students Federation is now recognizing 16 different genders and we're just asking people sorry 15 if they can identify what each of these letters stand for bisexual transsexual queer lesbian gay bisexual you miss the other G there G and genderqueer genderqueer you know what that is though I know what queries I don't know what genderqueer is either L is a really easy one isn't yeah of course lesbian yeah yeah okay G double word the second G is a genderqueer okay do you know what that is by the way III don't know what it is you know what it is they're kind of different okay I'll take it so the B correct that would have been my guess but the correct answer is demisexual well if you want to ask someone evo ginger what is ginger that's like that's like on a second not not ginger gender yeah gender well they're like what's what engendered somebody roll we're all human right no matter if I'm black or white curse it's all about who you are as a person correct to 4 to 13 more to go the G genderqueer no there's no Q in this and like a hyphenated word I don't know if you're fucking Ameer this is very serious stuff you're targeting people while they don't know what you're talking about so that you can get news and fake news so you can talk to people and you can actually get news based on it and I think it's actually really rude so well a lot of people say that alcohol works as truth serum don't you subscribe to that yeah but I think that the fact that you can't do that well in like a natural state like you can't get people to talk naturally so you have to go out at night and get people to talk while they're under the influence I think that's really rude we also go on campus and do this generation Trudeau stick there are you with the Ryerson journalism program no I'm actually with Seneca York and I think that it's really rude that you do that what do you think your prospects are for a job in journalism these days I know a lot of stuff and I don't want to talk about it to you because if you have to talk to other people that are under the influence I think that you really sad and you need to know like you need to like you're like targeting people so that you can get good good stuff for your stories like I feel like that's what isn't that what it's all about getting good stuff we don't to be boring I mean you know yeah you don't want to be boring but you want to get the grill shit you don't want to get the stuff that you don't want to like do it while people are under the influence because you're really doing it when people are not at their best and like honestly that's not true ethics of journalism and honestly I don't I don't approve so I was taking journalism ethics I would fail right now really you would because you're talking to a bunch of 22 year old so and you're like what 50 I'll take it what do you think of the elementary students you know being involved in all this 15 different gender business this is from the Ontario Elementary Teachers Federation can you tell me what that means okay I'll read you the list so I don't have the gasps no no it is Canadian and it's from the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario and here's the list lesbian gay genderqueer bisexual demisexual transgender transsexual two-spirit intersex queer questioning asexual allies diversity is our strength right it's fucking bullshit and absolutely fucking Lillee how do you how do you identify I am a lesbian oh this is very interesting so as a lesbian woman you are saying this is ridiculous then absolutely it is
