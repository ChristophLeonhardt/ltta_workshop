I've just got my hands on that iPhone 6 but I've got to say I'm just not that impressed with this camera mainly because there aren't that many upgrades to this thing if you update your older device to iOS 8 you get two of the touted iPhone 6 camera features nando exposure control which allows you to lighten or darken your photos and videos in time-lapse video side note in order to create a good time lapse you have to keep your camera as steady as possible the new design of the iPhone 6 doesn't quite allow that the iPhone 6 also has the same piece of camera as the iPhone 4s 5 and 5s with an 8 megapixel sensor which means your photos come out to the same resolution yes the aplans 6 takes great photos in low light thanks to its 1.5 micron pixels and f 2.2 aperture but this already exists in the iPhone 5s now one completely unique feature that iPhone 6 is for your facing camera is that you can shoot in 1080p at 60 frames per second this creates a smoother looking video but to the untrained eye it's hard to tell the difference between the videos shot in 60 frames and another shot in 30 frames you can also shoot 720p video all the way up to 240 frames per second up from 120 frames per second in the iPhone 5s all this means is you can make even solar slow-motion videos it's cool really cool but it feels like a gimmicky feature that you won't use that often as for the front facing camera the iPhone 6 has at 1.2 megapixel blacks same as the 5 and 5s the only Edition here is his first mode feature which lets you take 10 selfies per second overall the iPhone 6 is a fine smartphone camera one that's well but good enough to shoot this entire video review the six is a slight upgrade over the 5s with better autofocus and image stabilization but if you're looking for an excuse to upgrade to the iPhone 6 don't make the camera your only reason unless here well really into selfies before you buy the new iPhone you should decide which version is right for you do you want the iPhone 6 or 6 plus and you need 16 64
