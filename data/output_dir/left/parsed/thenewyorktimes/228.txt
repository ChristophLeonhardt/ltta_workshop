For over a half century,
Cuba and the Castros
have gone hand in hand.
Often clad in green military fatigues,
Fidel ruled the island
nation as a dictator,
squashing dissent and
confronting a superpower
just 90 miles away in America.
Now, in a historic
power shift,
a new face is assuming
power in Cuba.
His name is Miguel Díaz-Canel
and he’s been lurking
in the background, standing
shoulder to shoulder
with Fidel and
his brother Raúl,
and yet all the
while, he was slowly
moving up the ranks,
becoming the country’s
vice president in 2013.
It’s the first time a non-Castro
will be president
in more than 40 years.
He takes over from
Raúl, who succeeded
his older brother in 2008.
It’s also the first
time that someone
who wasn’t part of the
revolution takes the reins.
Raúl Castro had put in
place rules that limit
a president to two five-year terms.
And he’s lived up to that.
But Castro is not
exactly disappearing.
He will continue to head
the Communist Party,
arguably the most powerful
political post in Cuba.
So this is a slow
changing of the guard.
But it signals a
huge shift in how
Cuba will operate,
politically and economically.
Unlike the Castros, who
established their legitimacy
through the
communist revolution,
Díaz-Canel will have
to cement his role
by delivering on some
much-needed reforms,
including fixing the island’s
two-currency system.
As it stands, there’s both
a national currency
and another one
pegged to the U.S. dollar,
effectively barring
parts of the population
from purchasing
certain basic goods
and from actively participating
in the larger economy.
Díaz-Canel also needs to
cultivate more opportunities
for the country’s restive youth.
“I hope that the line that
Raúl Castro established
a few years ago can be
steadily improving and
more businesses, more
licenses, that’s what I hope.”
Díaz-Canel is likely to maintain
Cuba’s ties with Russia and China
as relations with the U.S. 
continue to sour.
He has also said that he plans to 
expand access to the internet.
But on the question of
human rights, like censorship,
Cuba’s tight grip is likely
to take longer to loosen.
So just how did Díaz-Canel
emerge in a country
whose rulers have had
an iron grip on power?
He grew up 170 miles east
of Havana, in Santa Clara,
where he worked as an
engineering professor
and a local Communist Party leader.
From there, he went on to become
the youngest-ever member,
at 43 years old,
of the Politburo,
the most powerful body
within the Communist Party.
He was appointed minister
of higher education in 2009
and was handpicked to be
vice president in 2013.
Experts say he rose by
keeping a low profile
and toeing the country’s line.
And with Raúl keeping
close watch over his rule,
any change will
likely come slow.
