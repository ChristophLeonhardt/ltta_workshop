00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing because obviously the music is</font>

48
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,729
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

49
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,500
my iphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called athelia which is</font>

50
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,480
quite tragic but this is a lady<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone I</font>

51
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,430
can't stop myself and recording things

52
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,290
all the time the voice memos I'm just

53
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,730
doing everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love it</font>

54
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,190
I'm just so happy not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to top up</font>

55
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,350
my friend if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in funny emotional</font>

56
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,640
states<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you just need to call someone</font>

57
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
and you can't call someone because you

58
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any bloody credit on your phone so</font>

59
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,560
it's been quite nice to be on contract

60
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,820
so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are being quite patient with</font>

61
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,260
me for now but I half expect one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

62
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,460
friends to turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say do you</font>

63
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,570
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to stab you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the face because</font>

64
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,580
there's an app for that at to<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone</font>

65
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,300
if it weren't 140 in the morning i would

66
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,920
call someone up and do that thing that

67
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,870
iphone users always do talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

68
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,730
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iphone when they're filming a</font>

69
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,080
video and they have conversations with

70
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,729
them I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never seen anyone with any</font>

71
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,619
phone other than an iphone do that but

72
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,450
it's clearly not exclusively a knife a

73
00:02:12,450 --> 00:00:00,000
thing I don't know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get it</font>
