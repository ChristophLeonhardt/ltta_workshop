IT'S NO LONGER DOWN WITH TRUMP. IT'S TRUMP! Martha: LOVELY, RIGHT? HERE NOW CAMPAIGN MANAGER OF THE TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN. HE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS DIGITAL DIRECTOR OF THE TRUMP 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. BRAD, GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. Martha: YOU HEARD WHAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS SAYING AND TAPE, WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY THAT SHE SAID THAT THEIR DATA WAS NOT WORKABLE, IT WASN'T WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND THAT THE DATA THAT YOU GUYS WERE USING WAS BASICALLY FAKE NEWS AND DATA MINING THAT SHE THOUGHT WAS QUESTIONABLE. YES. THE THING IS, ONCE OBAMA WON, THEY BECAME COMPLACENT A LITTLE BIT. SO AFTER THAT THEY FORMED THE OFA AND WHEN THEY DID THAT THEY REALLY KIND OF SPLIT UP EVERYTHING. IN DOING SO THEY REALLY GOT THEMSELVES BEHIND. SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND IN THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE GOT AHEAD. Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE CHARGE THAT IT WAS FAKE NEWS AND NEFARIOUS DATA MINING? I DON'T THINK IT'S FAKE NEWS. FAKE NEWS AND DATA MINING? THE DEMOCRATS WERE DEFINITELY BEHIND US. WHAT WE DID IS BUILD UP A REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND VOTER PROFILE THAT YOU HAD AGGREGATE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD USE THAT INFORMATION CAME FROM THE PARTY. Martha: IN TERMS OF HOLLYWOOD, THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE TURNING TO HOLLYWOOD TO HELP THEM WITH VOTER TURNOUT AND MESSAGING. THEY HAVE CONFERENCE CALLS WORK ON THEIR EMAIL LIST AND ONE RECENT WEEK MEETING A MIDWESTERN SENATOR THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS GUN-CONTROL WITH CONSERVATIVE LEANING VOTERS IN HER STATE ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE PARTICIPANTS. THEY ARE TRYING TO TALK TO FOLKS IN HOLLYWOOD, DIRECTORS IN HOLLYWOOD, ACTORS ARE ALSO PART OF THIS GROUP AND SAY HOW CAN WE REACH THESE MIDDLE VOTERS AND GET THEM TO NOT VOTE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP? I THINK HOLLYWOOD ELITES ARE JUST BEHIND. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW IN DONALD TRUMP SOMEONE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT. HE'S THE GUY THAT TAKES SHOWERS AFTER WORK, BEFORE WORK. THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED. THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I THINK AMERICA MOVES ON. DONALD TRUMP AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT PREVIOUS HAVE NOT DONE. TRY TO CONNECT WITH HOLLYWOOD, THEY ARE JUST OUT OF TOUCH. THE PROBLEM IS DONALD TRUMP IS COMMUNICATING, THE PEOPLE HE'S MAKING THESE THINGS FOR, THE TAX CUTS, HE'S MAKING THE AVERAGE AMERICAN LIFE IN THEIR PERSONAL ECONOMY AND THE PERSONAL SECURITY IS GETTING BETTER. LOOK AT WHAT HE DID WITH NORTH KOREA. Martha: IT SO INTERESTING BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I HAD McCARTHY ON, RUNNING FOR MAYOR IN CHICAGO AND HE'S A DEMOCRAT. HE'S RUNNING AGAINST RAHM EMANUEL, WHO IS ALSO A DEMOCRAT GARY McCARTHY IS SAYING THERE ARE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO ARE LIKE ME AND HE IS SOMEONE WHO REALLY FINDS HIMSELF MORE IN THE MIDDLE POLITICALLY BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT ROBERT DE NIRO AS WE SHOWED YOU THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE TONY'S WITH THE PROFANITY-LACED TIRADE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND THEN HERE'S WHAT HE SAID TODAY, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME SORT OF APOLOGY. WATCH. I WANT TO MAKE A NOTE OF APOLOGY FOR THE IDIOTIC BEHAVIOR OF MY PRESIDENT. IT'S A DISGRACE AND I APOLOGIZE TO JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE G7. IT'S DISGUSTING. Martha: YOUR THOUGHTS? AGAIN, THESE GUYS ARE JUST DISCONNECTED. DONALD TRUMP IS FIGHTING FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER. CANADA HAS RAISED 270% TARIFFS. PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THESE COUNTRIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US EVERY DAY AND DONALD TRUMP IS FIGHTING FOR THEM. AMERICAN TRADE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE HAVE AND WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR OUR WORKERS. OUR JOBS HAVE BEEN MOVED OVERSEAS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING THE THINGS, HE NEEDS TO FIGHT AGAINST THESE. HE'S STANDING UP, HE'S STANDING STRONG AND THAT'S WHAT AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE VOTED FOR, SOMEONE LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD STAND UP TO THEM. THE HOLLYWOOD ELITES DON'T LIKE IT. THEY DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP SUCCESS. THEY DON'T LIKE SEEING WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 500, 510 DAYS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO ANYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE CRAZY COMMENTS TO GET THE STORY OFF TO SOMETHING ELSE. THEY THINK THEY CAN SHIFT THE STORY AWAY FROM THE SUCCESSES
