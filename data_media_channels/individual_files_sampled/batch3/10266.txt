I was forced to have the operation in second grade of junior high school please return the life that I've lost my life has been made pathetic however in my heart I have a feeling that I want to tell the story kita was sterilized as a teenager without warning or explanation he was taken to a hospital and operated on he was later told it was punishment for misbehavior at school something considered abnormal now he's suing the government for about two hundred and seventy thousand dollars when he married later on he couldn't bring himself to tell his wife and after decades of a childless marriage he managed only to break the news shortly before her death in 2013 when I confided to my wife about the operation I apologized her from the bottom of my heart that I made one woman unhappy I can't imagine how hurts my wife was whenever she was told by people around her that you still haven't had a child and by her friends that why can't you have a child she was just looking at me listening to my story and when she finished listening she didn't say anything about the operation at all but just said the kindest words when I die always have energy and eat well Japan's eugenic protection law was first introduced in 1948 with an intent of what was described as preserving the purity of the Japanese race it allowed for the sterilization of people with genetic disabilities with the declared intent of eliminating malignant genes however inaccurate medical tests often led to wrongful surgical treatment permitting operations on over 16,000 people in Japan until 1996 ito story is a rare one though as earlier lawsuits showed the majority of victims were women and he only revealed his story after he had heard them speak up we previously interviewed the woman who was the first to do this I had a hard time going through the middle school one of the teachers took me in as a caretaker at his house there I was constantly abused by his wife I never had the chance to see the official papers to back my diagnosis either she hated me my parents told me that I was operated on and now I cannot have babies my father didn't agree to the operation he was forced to sign documents by my teacher and welfare officers the government claims its hands are clean as it was just complying with Japanese law at the time but for the victims this isn't good enough officials plan to carry out a nationwide survey into the consequences of the now-defunct law amidst increasing scrutiny of the practice with more operations being to classify day by day it's causing more people to demand the government compensate its victims unfortunately this won't return the lives the victims say they've lost the only thing kita is left to hope for is justice for him and others I want to push forward this trial for those people who suffered too
