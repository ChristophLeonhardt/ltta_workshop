so tell me about the sweater you're
wearing it's a coat of many colors like
Dolly Parton's do you like Dolly Parton
mm-hmm
sure mamas irritated over why do you
listen to her too much
mama says hello I turn Katy Perry and
Dolly Parton like 30 times a day do you
want to grow up to be like them
mom says I might grow up to be the
president yeah what would you change
about the world if you were president um
that chance people be free and go to the
bathroom they want to go to
I feel like we're in a position now
where you know it's just not safe this
is my child like I had to look at her at
night and say please Lord protect her
like she's in the highest most likely
rate to be murdered in a hate crime in
our country she's in the highest risk
group for committing suicide in our
country she's not a higher risk because
she's trans she's at higher risk because
we're allowing this bigotry and
Prejudice to to continue
I lived most of my life trying to be
what people expected me to be me
I was a six-foot to 200-pound outside
linebacker and so yes I was guy God have
you ever been discriminated against for
being a trans woman I am recovering from
a stroke I have had my car repossessed I
have almost no money I live on Social
Security and I can trace that back to
one decision I I came out at work
up until the day that laws are changed
people don't always kill trans people
feel like they can get away with it
because it's being justified there's a
possibility that I can be murdered
because I'm trans yes there is a
possibility but at the end of the day
before I am murdered those that were
murdered before me I want to make sure
that they have a voice still do you know
anybody who's been killed for being
trans mm-hmm I know multiple people that
have been killed for being trans
you
