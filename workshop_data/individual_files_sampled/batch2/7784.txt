researchers from Toronto have developed a way to read our minds sort of but this advanced technology is essentially setting the the groundwork in order to create what is necessary to help people who are paralyzed to communicate if they are having difficulty speaking so that's the upside of it but of course if this technology is advanced to the point where people could read anyone's minds it could be abused but first let me tell you where we're at at the moment when it comes to being able to read people's minds now the researchers have developed a technique that can produce a digital image of what a person is picturing in their mind simply by reading the electrical activity of their brain now how do they do this well the researchers hooked up the volunteers to EEG via electrodes placed on their heads they then showed the participants the faces of 140 individuals one by one on the computer screen while recording their brain activity they're looking at these images on a computer screen the electrodes that are connected to their head is basically measuring the activity of their brains and then this is where things get super interesting on a computer installed with special machine learning algorithms the team recreated the images of the faces that the participants were looking at using the data recorded by the EEG essentially the algorithm searched for brain signals related to the mental image that the volunteers were holding in their mind and reproduced it as a digital image so think about it this way they look at images on a computer screen someone's face for instance in this case and then later on through the data that was recorded through the EEG the scientists were able to recreate what these individuals saw in those images right like so it wasn't perfect but what was fascinating is is how accurate it was compared to let's say how a person would describe a person's face later on yeah yeah so when I first saw the headline I was like not buying it I know we get all these futuristic article and and sometimes people get carried away now they're gonna be able to read your mind and but when's the holodeck coming okay that's the thing I'm interested and sometimes people promise that I'm stalling here right but when I read how they described how they did it I was like oh yeah that'll work okay so but the key here is they show you the images and then record electric activity in your head so that when they see that same pattern in your head they know what the images so don't let them record your head in the first place so this is literally an episode of black mirror and it was the skin for me personally it was the scariest episode but it's the same kind of situation where in order for someone to read your mind they have to put some gadget on your head so you're right don't don't let people put gadgets on your head no because it has begun they say the pictures are not bad and and better than memory and they say look it could really help people that's true that's how it always starts so for example if you can't speak they can show you the images record your how your brain a receives those images and then whenever you think that again it will show that image to someone so in a sense you are speaking to them the problem is you can't contain it so if if you're just or you know they recorded all those images and you didn't want to think about that cute girl at the mall but then no it came to your head and then your girlfriend is oh right one of a thousand different problems that could it could create and so it could be used for good genies out of the bottle could be really helpful in the times up in me to movement I mean you could check around a ton of evidence there for sexual harassment in the workplace or but I mean yeah there's a lot of ways in which this could be abused it starts to feel like like transfer of consciousness is not too far away it's not I hate all of this I'm sorry I do I don't like any of it I I see how it could potentially be good but just doing a quick cost-benefit analysis and knowing how technology already gets abused and used against us I just don't want any of this well look first of all we don't have a choice because we could try to stop it it won't work if somebody else somewhere else in the world would like it's like your opinion man but we're gonna go ahead and do it in this country and then it'll spread and spread and you can't stop technology and but I like to kind of go spin this Simone put on it as a part-time transcendentalist and Taoist that if we then use this to share consciousness in a sense then we all become one mm-hmm Buddhist surveillance yeah they're like Oh Taoism I like this but but the one good thing seriously is that if we all find out what each other is are thinking in the beginning there's gonna be madness and and terrible things that people buy now like what are the world right and then probably hopefully at some point oh oh so everybody was saying you what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you can get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network calm slash join
