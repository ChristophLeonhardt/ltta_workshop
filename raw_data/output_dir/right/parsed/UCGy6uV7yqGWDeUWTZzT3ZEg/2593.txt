I'm standing on the edge of the gaara's
Weiler coal mine and if you can see in
the distance if you can see through the
fog there are wind turbines now those
wind turbines could stop at any moment
if it gets too windy or not windy enough
but what never stops is the activity in
the coal mine beside me but that point
is lost on the environmentalists in Bonn
who need diesel to power their dinner
parties for the revolt media I'm Sheila
Gunn read we're in Bonn Germany all this
week for the UN climate change
conference we are taking you places and
showing you things the mainstream media
just won't to see all of our coverage
and to pitch in to cover the cost of our
trip go to rebel un com
