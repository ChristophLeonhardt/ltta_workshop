1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
here we go 120 miles per hour category 3
hurricane and it's headed to the US

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,309
Virgin Islands from here right over
Dominica today this is the area that's

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,900
going to get hit the hardest and then
right over Puerto Rico category 3 likely

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,789
even category 4 hurricane hunter flying
through it right now our go about 80

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,869
miles per hour 35 minutes ago about 90
miles per hour and then they found the

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,619
core then they found the key to this
storm and why they upgraded it to a

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,098
category 3 the wind gusts to 120 miles
per hour and the latest millibar if you

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,890
want to write this down 958 so still
dropping rapidly by the time it gets to

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,100
Puerto Rico 150 mile per hour sustained
winds now this goes over the southern

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,870
BVI the US Virgin Islands be Akos
Culebra and all the way into Puerto Rico

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,579
as a major major hurricane likely
category 4 on the verge of category 5

12
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,500
but at least so far not there yet the
waters warm we know what happened to

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,340
Irma Irma was slightly farther to the
north but these two are actually going

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,580
to cross here is day 5
here's day 6 7 8 6 7 8 on the US and the

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,570
American models and the European model
here so we're not gonna move very much

16
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,040
after that after that after 4 or 5 days
obviously it's entirely a guess but I

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,590
just want to show you that so far South
Florida not in the cone and also not in

18
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,159
the forecast when it comes to seven
eight days away in the computer models

19
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,119
nothing is out of the question clearly
we saw that with Irma where does the

20
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,159
cross happen the yellow line is Irma the
middle of this line here the red line

21
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,290
that is Maria right over the Turks and
Caicos rid of them dr right through

22
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,829
Punta Cana right through Dominican
Republic here and also into Puerto Rico

23
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,689
where we will see big swells on the east
side of the storm right over st. Croix

24
00:01:48,689 --> 00:00:00,000
with a damaging hit there
