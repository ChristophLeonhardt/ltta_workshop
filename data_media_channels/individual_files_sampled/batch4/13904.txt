all righty so today is the big tax reform day it finally has passed through Congress your taxes will go down the Democrats moan in lamentation we will talk about all that plus I sort of face-planted Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter and it's hilarious so we'll talk about all of that I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show yes I am back from Florida where I had a great time talking to the college students over at TP USA one of my favorite student groups and it was it was a blast I also met Donald Trump jr. which nice to meet you done as that was kind of fun but I have a lot to talk about today because a big news day and it of course starts with this massive tax reform package that is now passed the Republican house and the Republican Senate President Trump is set to sign that into law formerly probably after Christmas they have to work out a few more kinks I think and then he's gonna sign that into law so that is a big move I'm going to discuss everything that is in this tax reform package I'm going to recount the entire saga in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at helix leap so I had a really good trip to Florida there was one thing that did not go particularly well that was my sleep pattern my sleep pattern was a giant fail one of the reasons that my sleep pattern was a giant fail is because I did not have my helix sleep mattress helix sleep offers something that does not exist anywhere else it is a mattress personalize your unique preferences and sleeping style it will not set you back thousands of dollars go to helix sleep calm /ban you take there two to three minutes sleep quiz they ask you to sort of your body type do you like sleeping on your side or your stomach do you want the mattress to be firm or soft breathable or heat absorbent and then they will build a custom mattress for you it'll be the best thing that you have ever slept on my wife in actually had a more expensive mattress in our room and we moved it out of our room in favor of our helix sleep mattress it's being recommended by all of the top magazines out there your custom mattress arrives directly to your door and you it's in the box you unpack it it inflates and then it's ready to go and you can try it for a hundred nights if you don't love it they will pick it up and refund it to you in full refund you the full amount owed a helix sleep comm slash Bennett right now helix sleep comm slash Ben and you will get 50 bucks toward your custom mattress that's helix sleep comm / Ben for 50 bucks off your order helix sleep comm / menus that slash Ben also so that they know that we sent you and sleep better because this is one of those things where you invest a little bit of money in your mattress less than you would if you went retail and and you will end up making your life significantly better okay so today dawned amidst a cacophony of howling dogs mourning their dead masters men women children killed in a mass senseless slaughter by the passage of tax reform the Republicans just said that they wanted lower taxes Democrats knew the media knew that if this tax reform package were to go through then it would be like The Walking Dead zombies would wander the earth just dead bodies stacked up in cars on the highways that's exactly how it was this morning traveling back from Florida you know I was the only person on the plane I to fly myself the airports were deserted everyone was dead I don't even know who's listening to this program now I don't even know if there's anyone to listen to this program Austin over there is inanimate corpse just making this show happen from behind the screen and this is what they had warned about now the amazing thing is that I didn't know that everyone could be killed again since everyone was killed by net neutrality repeal a week ago but apparently death can be died a thousand times and so everyone's dead from that neutrality repeal and repeal of the Paris Accords and all the rest of it and now everyone has died again so you know I guess finally there's time for me to read just like burgess Meredith and Twilight Zone you know it's it's been very weird inhabiting this afterlife because it's so similar to regular life the only good thing is that Justin Bieber doesn't have any new good songs in this afterlife lately so that's been that's been excellent but otherwise it seems very similar and I will admit that now that I'm dead I feel a peculiar desire to head over to Chicago and vote Democrat which it had not occurred to me before but suffice it to say this is me being a sarcastic because not everyone is dead no one died in fact in fact your taxes just went down if you are 80% of Americans your tax went down today so here are the things you need to know about this historic tax reform bill and it really is historic okay it's historic because it is a massive reduction in the corporate tax ID everyone's focusing on the individual tax ID the part that really matters is the corporate tax reform okay so you're gonna get a little bittle bit of money back not insignificant you'll get a little bit money back on your taxes if you are in the middle class the average tax cut the average family how the average household is supposed to receive according to the Tax Policy Center a tax cut of about 1600 bucks in 2018 an average household earning 100 million bucks or more what see a tax decrease of approximately 70 grand compared to 870 bucks for households making 50 to 75 grand that's because people at the upper end of the tax spectrum are paying nearly all the net taxes in the country it's not because the Republicans just decided to benefit the rich it's that if you reduce rates for the rich they are getting back a lot more money because they're making a lot more money and they're paying a lot more money okay this isn't the big tax cut in history but it's not insignificant the idiotic idea that apparently 50% of Americans believe that you're gonna pay more tax because of this bill is just stupid and it's because the media have been lying to you the media been saying this is a redistributionist bill from poor to rich absolutely untrue now here's the thing the individual tax decreases sunset okay so in 2025 the individual tax decreases are supposed to go away but in all likelihood they're going to remain the reason they're gonna remain is who actually wants to vote openly for tax increases Democrats are probably gonna maintain those middle-class tax rates the reason that Republicans had them sunset in 2025 is because one of the budget tricks that has to be done here is if you wanted to pass in the Senate with 51 votes which is how many votes it got if you wanted to pass in the Senate with that number of votes instead of 60 to kill a filibuster then the CBO the Congressional Budget Office has to rule that the bill will be deficit-neutral so the bill is deficit neutral according to the CBO that's because of some gamesmanship by Republicans that's not rare okay here's the thing about the corporate tax rates and here's the case no one's gonna make corporate tax rates go down that means companies can afford to give raises that they can afford to actually create jobs and the early evidence of this is today AT&T announced that it would give a $1,000 across-the-board bonus to everyone thanks to the tax decrease and now that this corporate tax rate has been reduced they will give $1,000 bonus to everyone that's a pretty amazing thing now some may say that this is a cynical ploy by AT&T to basically give the Trump administration a good headline so that Trump will will allow the HNC Comcast merger to go through I'm not gonna say that that sounds right to me but it sounds exactly right to me still the corporate tax rate dropping is a good thing for business and the proof that it's a good thing for business is that in every other country where the corporate tax rate has been dropped precipitously what you see is significant GDP growth the most obvious example is Island Ireland actually has a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate so it's become a sort of business haven for corporations that wanted to business overseas and they've seen a high sustained growth thanks to that healthy business climate in 1995 they actually had a corporate business tax of 40% they dropped it to 12.5% and they've seen 23% GDP GDP growth since compared to 7.2 GDP growth from 1960 to 1995 over the course of 35 years they saw 7.2 percent GDP growth then they moved the the corporate tax rate down from 40 percent to 12.5 percent and over the last 27 years they have seen a 23 percent increase in GDP so this has also been seen in countries ranging from Germany to Spain when you reduce the corporate tax rate it makes it easier for other countries if I'm perfect for companies to invest in the United States they no longer are trying to organize his offshore companies there's also in this bill a big increase in the child tax credit that child tax credit is truly a redistribution scheme he's a lot of people who don't pay taxes are getting the child tax credit but it's backed by a lot of Republicans because they think that the families with children have higher expenses and we got to give them benefits I am actually as the father of two children I'm not really in favor of the child tax credit on a strictly libertarian viewpoint I don't think the government should be giving you incentives to behave in certain ways and I don't think anybody is having kids for the tax credit I don't think it's just you know oh well you know before I wasn't gonna have a kid now I'm getting 2,000 bucks back I suppose I'll have the child kids are a lot more expensive than that the average cost of a child from the time they're born until the time that they leave the house at 18 is hundreds of thousands of dollars but still this is something that looks good in the headlines for Republicans that they're trying to help out families that's why Marco Rubio pushed it there are a few people who'll be paying more in in income tax that includes me which makes me sad a tax reform includes reductions in tax deductions for state and local taxes so people in Heist tax states like California they're reducing my taxes through the tax rate but they're increasing my taxes because the deductions are not even close to what I'm going to be paying in my state tax in in the state of California plus the mortgage interest deduction has been decreased markedly you can now only take a mortgage interest deduction up to $750,000 alone in the state of California pretty much everybody who owns a home has a mortgage that is bigger than that itemization has been downsized so instead of you having to itemize every deduction they've doubled the standard deduction so a lot of people no longer have to itemize because you're only deducting you're only doing itemized deductions if you want deductions above and beyond the standard deduction now the standard deduction has been doubled so that means that itemized deductions are probably going to go the way the dodo burn for a lot of folks that's great it means that you don't have to hire an accountant you can now fill out your taxes on the back of a postcard you individual mandate is gone so this is a major win as well right the tax bill uses the death of the individual mandate to reduce deficits how why does it reduce deficits when you get rid of the individual mandate when people are supposedly being forced to pay into the system the reality is that because of the individual mandate because you are forced to go get health care people have gone and registered with Medicaid that costs millions and billions of dollars to the federal government fewer people are gonna register from Medicaid cuz they're not mandated to do so that means the bill goes down now is this entirely a good thing well it would be entirely a good thing just on the surface of it right you no longer have the federal government forcing you into a position where you must must must do this however it's not good for one reason that I'll explain in just a moment and the reason that the individual mandate leaving may not be the world's greatest thing is because if the individual mandate goes away you have to fill the gap for all of the sick people who are still in the individual insurance market right the way that we were filling that before is we were basically forcing young healthy people to buy insurance and that was driving the rates down in the individual insurance market they were basically paying to compensate a bunch of old sick people in the individual insurance market those rates are now likely to go up some and that means that the federal government is going to have to make a choice either they're gonna have to remove the Obamacare regulations which would be the ideal or they're going to have to fill in backfill the funding insurance companies lose because of the individual mandate that unfortunately seems like the way the federal government is going it seems like Republicans are gonna be voting basically for a new it looks like the Republicans are gonna be voting for a new entitlement program which is not a grand and glorious thing so I want to give you the rest of what's in this taxable but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Birch gold so despite the fact that the stock market is soaring despite the fact that the economy is going supremely well despite all of that I think that it is it is necessary to point out that the economy can always tank at any time right everybody thought the economy is going gangbusters in early 2007 and then it tanked on you one of the reasons that you ought to diversify it ought to have some money in precious metals is because of the risk of an economic downturn which could be brought about by anything from a public event to a foreign policy of it I'm not saying take your entire portfolio and put it in gold that'd be foolish but I am saying take some of your money and put it in precious metals when you choose to do that go to my friends at Birch golde group they have a long-standing track record of continued success with thousands of satisfied clients countless five-star reviews and a plus rating with the Better Business Bureau and right now they're giving away a comprehensive 16 page kit showing how gold and silver can protect your savings how you can legally move your IRA or 401k out of stocks and bonds and into a precious metals IRA if that's something you choose to do right now if you're looking at Bitcoin and saying wow bitcoin is doing really well that's because bitcoin is basically a controlled asset they're not making it anymore bitcoin that's the whole purpose of it gold basically performs the same function in the global market to get your no cost no obligation kit go to birchgold.com slash burn that's birchgold.com slash Ben check it out ask all your questions then when you're ready to invest talk to my friends at Birch cool comm slash bet okay so let's talk about the rest of what's in this bill so they're now opening the Anwar to oil exploration the Anwar is not on Rolla key it is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge so there's a portion of Alaska that has been ruled out of bounds by the federal government for the last couple of decades it should've been opened up a long time ago the part that they want to drill is very small it leaves a small footprint and the idea that it was going to destroy the environment in Alaska is utterly untrue supposedly their reserves under there that are about the size of Saudi Arabia possibly so drilling in the Anwar would be good for America's domestic oil reserves this is a good thing the one bad the the worst thing about this bills the deficits are gonna increase right the Republicans have said that will grow our way out of deficits that will be true to a certain extent it won't be true to the point where it'll cover for for the for the government revenue hole that's been blown in the budget but that's why Republicans should be focused on cutting now right Republicans should actually use this opportunity to cut now I know Republicans just want to win elections but what that leads to is big government at least to a battle between big government Republicans and big government Democrats and both of them end up blowing up the deficit if Republicans actually want to make a difference they're gonna have to take up another priority of speaker Ryan's and that is Medicaid reform Medicare reform block grants to States all these are things that the Republicans are gonna have to do okay so all of this said it's a good I like this bill I think it's a good bill it's not a perfect bill it has things that I would change about it but it is a fairly typical and very positive Republican tax bill people have lost their damn minds they have gone absolutely insane over this so yesterday at the Capitol in the middle of the vote there was a group of protesters who started chanting about how the bill was going to end in their imminent demise the actual medicine is not produced here it's produced in Ireland because the chair has detected a disturbance in the gallery in contravention of the law and against the rules of the house the sergeant-at-arms will identify the person or persons responsible and have them escorted from the House chamber so these idiots are up there shouting kill the bill don't kill us and apparently one of them decided to take off her top which I mean she understand she's in Congress right like in Congress like the same Congress that houses half the sexual perverts in America she just incentivized Congress to pass a tax bill every single day I didn't see a picture of the lady but I assume that you know if she is of the female persuasion and has breasts than half the congressmen in the place are excited about that that form of protest that seems to be counterproductive but kill the bill don't kill us I mean just demonstrates the extent to which the left has lost its might one of the people who's lost her mind obviously is Rosie O'Donnell she's not much of a mind left to lose sadly but Rosie O'Donnell tweeted this out she tweeted out so how about this I promise to give two million dollars to senator Susan Collins and two million to Senator Jeff Flake if they vote no no I will not kill Americans for the sewer rich she mens right super but she can't type it's suo ER rich DM me Susan DM me Jeff no bleep two million cash each it's like EE Cummings for the mentally deficient so well done there Rosie O'Donnell this by the way is a technically under federal law bribery so under 18 USC I believe the actual statute is 18 USC 2 and 1b it says quote whoever directly or indirectly corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity with intents who influenced any official act shall be fined under this title not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value which whichever is greater or in prison for not more than fifteen years or both and may be disqualified from holding any office of Honor trustor profit under the united states so she's openly offering four million dollars to republican senators for them to change their vote which is bribery under federal law she's doing that in front of apparently thirty two thousand likes so that that you know I guess she's must be willing to pay twelve million dollars to the federal government I said earlier if President Trump tells jeff sessions to initiate a prosecution against Rosie O'Donnell they will begin carving his face into Rushmore tomorrow I mean he will immediately move to the list of the nation's greatest presidents if he initiates prosecution again still against Rosie O'Donnell for for bribery so I tweeted out half jokingly this morning lock her up lock her up and Rosie O'Donnell got mad and she tweeted back at me suck my bleep Ben which doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons as far as I'm aware and so I tweeted back at her you're already a felon Rosie don't be a homophobic sexual harasser - and then I followed it up with hashtag me too so that's that is my a plus troll game right there again that is that it's the the troll is strong with me today I said Rosie O'Donnell yeah just making a fool of herself as always and she's not the only one who's going nuts the Democrats of course are going completely nuts as well the House passed the act and Paul Ryan brought out the giant gavel he brought out the the enormous gamble I guess they have this giant ceremonial gavel that they bring out for important occasions and also for sex parties and so Paul Ryan dragged that sucker out of storage when Nancy Pelosi stood there with the giant gavel and she first became Speaker and she had a bunch of children she had an aborted standing around her he brought that out of storage and he was whacking that on the on the pan on the on the podium as they passed it here was the video of them passing this thing in the house yesterday on this vote the yeas are 227 and the nays are 203 the conference report is adopted without objection the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table okay so that is a big win for Paul Ryan it's a big win for the house it's a big win for the Republican Senate and it's a big win for President Trump it is a big win for president Trump without this win he does not have a signature legislative achievement his entire first year without that win the biggest things that he's done this year are just ask or such and in the movement of the embassy to Jerusalem and the filming of the appellate judge I talked in the last podcast about all of the things that I think Trump has done right but this is a signature achievement in his first year and he needed one right for Obama he had several he had the lilly Ledbetter Act and then it took a year and a half but he got Obamacare he had passed the stimulus package which was really his big achievement in his first year george w bush passed tax cuts I believe in the middle of year one so Trump needed this he needed it pretty badly and he deserves to be able to celebrate about Paul Ryan says this is a profound change to the tax system here's what he had to say this is one the most important pieces of legislation that Congress has passed in decades to help the American worker to help grow the American economy this is profound change and this has changed that is gonna put our country on the right path okay so the Democrats of course went completely nuts because their basic belief system suggest that you don't own your own money right that any tax cut to you you keeping more of your own money is actually theft from the federal coffers and this just it demonstrates the the genuine disconnect as far as what Republicans and Democrats think in terms of where your rights come from the government the Democrats believe that your rights come from government your right to have property is because the government has allowed you to have property if it weren't for the government allowing you to have property you wouldn't have property right this is the Elizabeth Warren barack obama view that you didn't build that right your property rights are based on a government that makes those property rights available to you the Republican notion the conservative founding notion is that property rights predated government that government was instituted in order to protect those property rights and that if the government violates those property rights it has lost its raise on debt its lids lost the reason for its existence so you can see this gap in the way the Democrats talk about this so Nancy Pelosi went up there with a giant yellow sign that says hashtag GOP tax scam and says that raises taxes on 88 million middle-class families that is a lie it does not taxes on 88 million middle class families there is I don't know where the hell they're getting that statistic but there's no evidence whatsoever that that is the case does 83 percent of the benefit goes to the wealthiest 1% okay that is because the wealthiest 1% are paying a wildly disproportionate share of the taxes and says it results in 13 million more uninsured Americans that's a lie too because getting rid of the individual insurance mandate what that does it allows people to opt out you can still buy insurance right you can still go get covered by Medicaid tomorrow right you can go tomorrow if you are eligible for Medicaid you can go get covered by Medicaid what it means is that the vast majority of people are gonna be dropping out don't want to bother with doing these things and so they haven't bothered to go buy insurance and they shouldn't be forced to but in any case here's Nancy Pelosi saying that this is this tax plan is theft how how is it theft i honest to god I don't understand how it's tough for me to keep more of my own money this GOP tax scam cent is simply theft monumental brazen theft from the American middle class and from every person who aspires to reach it the GOP tax scam is not a vote for an investment in growth or jobs is a vote to install a permanent plutocracy in our nation they'll be cheering that later okay they'll be cheering the plutocracy later the theft again the plutocracy is centralized government stealing your money and using it for whatever purpose a nancy pelosi wants to put it to the idea that it is a it is a theft for the government to not take money out of my pocket is it's beyond reasoning it's beyond reasoning and that's not the only dumb thing that Nancy Pelosi had to say right Nancy Pelosi had to say something even more dumb and here's what now Andy here's the here's in one second I'm gonna play you the incredibly stupid thing that Nancy Pelosi had to say so here it is Nancy Pelosi this clip 19 Nancy Pelosi says that not only is this a is this a tax theft not only is it creating plutocracy it betrays what the founding fathers would have wanted it does violence to the vision of our founders it disrespects the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform who are a large part of our middle class and to whom we owe a future worthy of their sacrifice and it portrays the future and betrays the aspirations of our children and betrays the future and betrays our past the founding fathers does she understand that the reason that we fought a revolution is because no taxation without representation it was literally the slogan of the revolution is she aware and one of the reasons people were mad is because Britain kept putting taxes on all of the imported goods right would the Stamp Act and the tea acted like she aware of anything remotely related to American history here like the founders would have hated our tax regime the founders didn't even believe in an income tax we had to pass a constitutional amendment to allow an income tax one of the worst constitutional amendments in American history right it's it by I would say easily actually the worst constitutional amendment American history even worse than prohibition was the it was the income tax but this is just it's beyond it's beyond reason the Democrats have made up an alternative history in the United the United States in which Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and John Adams and James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were all giant government centralized government people which is just patently insane you know that if you listen to the show we go through a federalist paper every Monday have we yet come to the point where we say we need a federal government to suck up all the resources and redistribute them has that ever come up in the Federalist paper it has not nor will it ever even gonna get through all 80 odd Federalist Papers right she's not gonna happen so she's not the only one saying dumb stuff chuck schumer the the Senate Majority Minority Leader still Minority Leader thank God he says that the public knows this bill is bad and here is where the rubber hits the road we're gonna talk in a second about whether this bill really is bad for Republicans even though it is a politically useful thing they don't want to discuss it they don't want to have it have sunlight shed on it they don't want anyone to know what's in it because it is so so bad and the public knows it okay it is so so bad in the public notice to the polls show that this is wildly unpopular tax bill there are a couple reasons for that one the media are just awful the media are just awful they their treatment of the tax bill has been completely unfair the AP branded headline after it passed saying massive Republican tax giveaway to the rich that was in their headline okay that level of bias is just bizarre and insane CNN plastered its front page Joubert cnn.com with anti tax reform messages it was all over the media that this tax reform was the end of the world that millions would die it was something that we should all be deeply worried over and deeply upset about none of that was true it's why fifty percent of Americans think their taxes are going up even though their taxes are going to go down so part of that is the media part of it is that Republicans are incompetent at pitching this thing you know President Trump he gets credit for passing this thing but it would be great if the president would spend a fair bit of time explaining for example why the corporate tax rate needed to drop right that would be really excellent I'd like for him to tax honestly I would like for him use Twitter for a good effect I'd like for the president to tweet out the European corporate tax rates and then the American corporate tax rates because the average European corporate tax rate right now is eighteen point four three percent we just brought our corporate tax rate down to twenty one percent we brought it down by 14 percent and it is still higher than the average European tax rate corporate tax rate President Trump really should do a public relations blitz a big victory for him so now he should use all of the power that he has to bring cameras to him to discuss tax reform and use Twitter that way right because otherwise you know we don't need another fight with Lavar ball but what we do need is a solid public relations campaign and this is Trump specialty Trump specialty is the PR campaign it's what he is best at in life so I'd love to see him put that to good effect here to put that to good use that I think would be an excellent thing so I'd like to see the President of the United States do that also the Republicans kept pitching this thing in terms of individual tax rates none of them have ever bothered to explain why corporate tax rates going down is better and the reason corporate tax rates going down is better is because that money can now be used by the corporation to hire more people to invest more to to pay their workers more to give people raises Republicans should be making that case loudly and proudly and they should be saying every Democrat opposed this your taxes went down and every Democrat opposed this but unfortunately the Republicans have not done a good PR job now the problem is this when you have an unpopular bill and you pass it even if it's good for Americans it's pretty rare that an unpopular bill gets wildly more popular over time that is not a that is not a usual thing to happen Obamacare was very unpopular when it passed it was in net negative territory and there was 59 percent by one poll 59 percent of Americans at the time of passage of Obamacare disapproved of Obamacare and it really never recovered it was always an unpopular law the only point of popularity came when Republicans tried to get rid of it and the media went on a full-out blitz but it's pretty rare for a bill to get more popular over time even if it does get more popular it's not gonna be for front of the public's imagination you make a case for the bill well you're passing the bill you don't make the case for the bill after the bill has passed the reason for that is it fades into people's woodwork right mean you have other things to worry about now this week we're talking tax reform last week we talked tax reform the week before that we talked tax reform by the time you pay your taxes you've probably forgotten about tax reform you just signed the check and you're done with it right that's what you do your accountant handles it for you so this is this is sort of the problem the the Republican Congress does not know how to do a Public Relation blitz president Trump does but he hasn't done it yet I wish they'd been doing it for the last month they should do it now the fact they had to rush it through is going to be picked on by the media and now every piece of fallout from this bill it's going to be used to Club Republicans to death over it so Republicans had better shaped this thing in the public imagination right now not just wait for the inevitable time when Americans realize tax cuts are good that would be that I think would be a very big mistake again if you look at the polls on down on tax cuts historically then what you see is that the Bush tax cuts were were significantly more popular than the Trump tax cuts part of that is because of Trump part of that is because of the media coverage in fact these tax cuts because of the media coverage are actually less popular then some tax hikes have been okay so here is the the good rundown on the polling numbers this is from five thirty eight.com the Reagan tax cut in 1981 had a twenty five percent plus twenty five percent differential 51 percent approved twenty six percent no the 2001 W tax cut twelve percent plus 12 right forty nine to thirty seven the extension of the Bush tax cut in 2010 had a twelve percent positive upside fifty-four percent approved the extension of the Bush tax cuts to in 2013 that had a seven percent net positive rating the Bush tax cuts too right in 2003 that had a six percent positive rating the Reagan tax cuts too in 1986 that at a four percent positive rating the Clinton tax hikes of ninety three had a negative 10 percent rating forty four percent proved only 34% approved the HW Bush tax hike had a negative 11 percent approval rating so 52 to 41 disapproved and the Trump tax cuts are 14% underwater that is largely because of the media it is also because the Republicans have done a piss-poor job of selling their bill they need to get out there and they need to sell that bill because bills don't get more popular over time even when people feel the benefit of it Democrats will pay by the way when they try to raise the taxes but remember they're not gonna have to actually try to do that until 2025 they can just sit there and and let it go all the way till 2025 and then wait to see what happens okay so as we continue in just second I'm going to talk about the media bias and how the media bias plays in because it really is truly astonishing I want to show you some clips of members of the media and how they have responded to these tax cuts it is beyond the pale so here we go let's begin with Savannah Guthrie so Savannah Guthrie over at NBC News she was questioning Paul she was questioning Paul Ryan and Ryan is talking about tax cuts and what kind of good they're going to do and Savannah Guthrie literally asked him if he is living in a fantasy world on national television after they passed a massive Republican tax plan a problem is a lot of CEOs has said really candidly I'm looking at a list of CEOs who said we don't plan to reinvest what they're planning to do is do stock buybacks to line the pockets of shareholders let me quote Michael Bloomberg a billionaire hardly an enemy of business he said CEOs aren't waiting on a tax cut to jumpstart the economy a favorite phrase of politicians who have never run a company or to hand out raises it's pure fantasy to think that the tax bill will lead to significantly higher wages and growth I'll ask you plainly are you living in a fantasy world and what the hell kind of question is that are you living in a fantasy world and what what is wrong with you Haywood they asked what they asked Obama this did they ever ask Jonathan Gruber this or Obama during Obamacare you said that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor every doctor in America says that's not true every single one pretty much are you living in a fantasy world was that ever asked I mean you want to see media bias in action that right there is media bias in action then you wonder why the American people have a bad opinion of the bill it's because of people like Savannah Guthrie who are doing the job that the Democrats have been attempting to do for years and Savannah Guthrie isn't the only one Katy tur in the in the aftermath of the Republicans voting to to pass the bill she is talking with a with a GOP representative and she throws out the suggestion that the reason that Republicans are passing this thing is that they can pay less personally intact she's talking to Dave brat the Republican from Virginia the the tea partier extraordinaire and here is Katy tur going after him and suggesting that it's just because he is these rich that he wants to pay it what's the median household income of your district it's right about sixty we have it at seventy three thousand something around there whoa what are what are you making if you don't mind what's in your bank account right now in my bank account what tax bracket are you are you gonna be under under this bill well a court for you here I'll be probably in the twenty four percent bracket twenty can go look up their rates okay Republican congressman David what are you what are you at Katie so make sure you do not a lawmaker so I'm not involved in marking up this little selling it to the American people well what you got what you're making to Kato good good for Dave brat right there because the fact is that when they asked they have brat he's lowering his own taxes that's why he's doing this thing and it's not a principal thing it's just the entire premise of the question is so sick and messed up the entire premise of the question that she is asking right there is the only reason that you would want taxes decreases not because you think it's better for the American people or your constituents or the economy it's because you personally are seeking to benefit from the tax bill right but all those Democrats who are rich they're just men of the people they're just patriotic those are great patrons Michael Bloomberg great Patriot but you Dave brat you are a cruel inhumane man because if you make a lot of money that means you don't care about people I was for tax cuts when I was making sixty grand a year and I'm for tax cuts when I make a hell of a lot more than sixty thousand dollars a year I was for tax cuts when I wasn't earning anything and I was a student because ideologically speaking speaking just based on my understanding of economics tax cuts generate more revenue by putting more money in my pocket that I can spend as I see fit beyond that I'm for tax cuts because it's my money and it's your money and I don't have a right to your money but this implication is being put forward by the media the Republicans aren't like it's only doing this because he wants a tax cut are you freaking kidding me Donald Trump is worth billions of dollars even if you don't believe is worth 10 billion he's probably worth at least two okay you think Donald Trump is sitting there right now thinking to himself yeah you know I really need to give myself a tax cut that's top of my priority list is giving myself a tax cut are you crazy are you out of your mind all these Republican legislators they're sitting around thinking yeah you know what by the way if you want to get rich in Congress the easiest way to get rich in Congress is not giving yourself a tax cut the easiest way to get rich in Congress is through insider trading it's by knowing which bills are gonna pass and then you buy stock in particular companies knowing how the bills gonna impact that company Peter Schweitzer showed this in in one of his books a few years back where he talked about corruption in DC this notion that that Republican legislators are only doing this because they're so evil is just absurd by the way I'll bet you Katie turns making a lot more money than a brat if I had to bet on it I mean the Dave brand I believe was a college professor if he's in the 24 percent tax bracket that means he's not making I mean he he's making decent money I think but but the idea that he's making all sorts of cash is not actually is not actually the case so I'm gonna you know I want to look that up because I would guarantee you the Katy tour is making a lot more money than Dave Brad so yeah if Dave Brad is in the twenty four percent bracket that means he's making between $82,000 $157,000 right if he's in that bracket by the way then that means that he's probably only saving three four thousand bucks okay he's not saving fifty grand Katy tur I I I'll have to look up Katy turns contract let's see if she's paid millions I'll bet I'll bet Katy tur makes a lot of money I'll bet I'll bet that she she makes three times easily what Dave brad is making if not then she then she needs to renegotiate her contract so that's that's absurd and you sing this across the board this media coverage they NBC MSNBC gave airtime to a health care activist what did this health care activist who was battling ALS and he waited outside Lindsey Graham's office in order to yell at Lindsey Graham over this because Lindsey Graham and the Republicans voted to get rid of the individual mandate the most unpopular aspect of the of Obamacare and so they put him on MSNBC they talked about Lindsey Graham ran away from him as a sinner Graham he was talking about John McCain his beloved colleague who like me dying of a brain disease and he was talking about John McCain and I said Senator Graham will talk to me for a minute about this bill and he ran away into a place where I'm not allowed to go as a civilian I know that NBC and MSNBC have footage of that you could try to find it he ran away and that exemplifies that moment I was there with Megan Anderson a woman is almost totally paralyzed that moment exemplified our publicans are treating this legislation and treating the American people they are afraid to see our humanity and okay nonsense this is it again a cheap media setup okay I objected to it when Piers Morgan's in and on gun control and I object to it now the idea that your philosophy of governance has to change because you are now meeting somebody who is suffering from particular condition is just asinine it's just not true it's the say it's in effect the same thing as Jimmy Kimmel taking his baby out every so often and holding up his baby and saying that he knows about health care now policy is either good or bad it is not good based on whether you can have a discussion in front of cameras with a guy who has ALS and an agenda I feel awful for that person of course you feel awful for people that doesn't mean that the policy they're espousing is bad and you know how that exchange is gonna go by the way the way that exchange is going to go is that Lindsey Graham will walk up to the guy have a cordial conversation the guy will refuse to hear what Lindsey Graham is saying because he comes with an agenda he's not there for an honest conversation he's there for the photo-op and then when Lindsey Graham says you know it's been nice talking to you and the guy who refuses to shake his hand because Lindsey Graham has voting for something the guy doesn't want the media blow it up oh the this watch this courageous a man suffering from ALS take Lindsey Graham to the woodshed if I have our Lindsey Graham I wouldn't engage in that conversation either because it's not worth it right where is it where's the public relations upside and where's the win you're not even having an honest conversation it's not like this guy actually wants to discuss with Lindsey Graham he wants Alexa Lindsey Graham but this is the game the media are playing today so just like the homeless reappear every eight years when a Republican takes office it's like Groundhog Day every so often the homeless just pop up on your screen and that only happens when Republicans are in the White House so the same thing happens with regard to taxes we never talk about tax increases and how they're gonna the American people we never talk about government spending and deficits and how they're gonna hurt the American people we only talk about these things when it comes to Republicans and that's only so that the media can carry out their their crusade against tax cuts altogether which is just it's pathetic now will Trump benefit from this you know this does change the man I got an email yesterday from from somebody who's asking me you know you graded Trump last week and he gave him an overall grade for his presidency of like a c-minus it must have been I think that's probably a couple of weeks ago nothing was last week it's probably a couple of weeks ago and and I given him an overall grade of C - based on his policy and his rhetoric and he said you've been pretty glowing about him in the last couple of weeks and the answer is yes because I'm getting the things I want right that was always my math my math was always is the president doing conservative things the last three weeks of president Trump's governance have been some of the most conservative weeks of Governments that I have ever seen period from any president I'm pretty young so the last Republican administration I remember was Bush he was not as conservative as Trump has been in the last three weeks for sure and so this has been a very good three weeks of governance it's very important governance - so that means that I raised Trump's grade from a c-minus on the year to a C+ which is a pretty major chef for anything that shifts him almost a full letter grade in the last three weeks of year the only reason that he's not doing better than that is because his approval ratings are bad because Republicans are running really far behind in the generic congressional ballot they're out yeah they're down 18 points in the latest poll one of the one of the things that Trump has to do here as they spoke about the other day it's very important now that now that Trump is actually pursuing conservative policies you represent conservatism well because otherwise all of those conservative policies will be rolled back it's very important that he represents my view well right now he's a representative of my ideology when he's actually acting in consonance with my ideology I want to see him represent that ideology well just as an American I want you know it's like watching the Olympics you want to see people wearing the American flag do well Trump is now wearing the conservative flag and has been for at least the last three weeks on governance and that means that I want to see him represent that well do well in the polls because of it I want I want to see conservative governance become more popular not less popular I don't want his personal and popularity to drag down the good policy he's been making I would like to see his popularity increase on the back of that good policy and that means some discipline so mr. president if you're listening please have some discipline messaging I think that you've won some major victories even the media are gonna have to recognize that you've had a major upswing in the last month of your presidency with regard to policy wins you have some momentum going into next year do not get distracted it's the holiday season celebrate it with your family shut down your Twitter for Christmas shut it down for the next three weeks make the left go mad make them go mad right starve them of your tweets if the left are waiting for you to give them some distraction from the loss they just suffered they're waiting for an excuse to go off on you they're waiting for an excuse to go crazy don't watch TV turn off your TV have yourself a Shabbos ready have yourself a Shabbat all right one of the things that's nice about my life is that every Friday evening to Saturday evening I just shut down right there's there's no cell phone there is no internet there's no TV and it's great you deserve a rest mr. president is what I'm saying to you I mean I wish that your deserved rest on sort of the entire year but now you really do deserve a rest because you've gotten some stuff done bask in the glow of having a major piece of legislation passed let the media feed on itself let the media eat itself let the media fulminate over what is a very typical Republican tax bill let them look foolish let them stew in their own juices you have the upper hand right now don't blow it don't blow it because now there's actually there's that and here's the thing Republicans are more likely to follow you mr. president if you don't blow it and if you if you actually start to boost your own approval ratings Republicans are more likely to come around on some of your other policy priorities like immigration and please for the love of God don't don't try to tackle daca that would be a mistake okay we're gonna continue in just a second but first you're gonna have to go over to Daley wired.com and subscribe for $9.99 a month you

bit of Bible talk so things I like yesterday I did gunfight at the OK Corral and today I'm going to do another movie with a signature tune and this and I think I'm gonna try and stick to westerns with signature Tunes but this is the this is High Noon of course this is Bill Clinton's favorite movie a lot of a lot of people on the right objected to this being Bill Clinton's favorite movie because the entire plot surrounds a sheriff who is basically left alone by the town to defend the town against a bad guy and a lot of conservatives said well that's really not how towns work right that's actually if Clinton viewed himself as the lone hero striding into history that's not good for the presidency the movie however is quite good Gary Cooper plays the sheriff Grace Kelly plays the the woman in his life who is a she's a Quaker I believe and she refuses to participate in violence the movie is is pretty compelling it's very small-scale it is very tightly edited and tightly crafted I heard a little bit of preview it's Gary Cooper a man who is too proud to run the judges left town Harvey's quit and I'm having trouble getting deputy people gotta talk themselves into law and order before they do anything about it maybe because down deep they don't care they just don't care I think you better go while there's still time it's better for you and it's better for us Amy I mean if you won't go with me now I'll be on that train when it leaves you I've got to stay why must you be so stupid what if you've forgotten what he is if he forgotten what he's done to people who've had forgotten that he's crazy don't you remember when he sat in that chair and said song isn't the title song is very famous of course you know do not forsake me oh my darlin it's very very famous in Western history a High Noon great movie worth watching check that out over the weekend if you have time okay other things that I like I have I'm have to admit I cannot stop laughing at the fact that Tana he see coats and Cornel West are now going at it Cornel West of course a radical black activist Tony he's he goes to slightly less radical black activist Tony he's he coats fancies himself in the mold of James Baldwin Cornel West fancies himself in the mold of Malcolm X both of them are both of them have a rather racially separatist view of American politics and Cornel West wrote an entire column where he says Tony he see coaches we were eight years in power a book about Barack Obama's presidency and the tenacity of white supremacy has captured the attention of many of us he says Coates and I come from a great tradition of the black freedom struggle he represents the neoliberal wing that sounds militants about white supremacy but renders black fightback invisible this wing reaps the benefits of the neoliberal establishment that rewards silences on issues such as Wall Street greed or Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands and people's he says the disagreement between coaching me is clear any analysis or vision of our world that omits the centrality of Wall Street power u.s. military policies and the complex dynamics of class gender and sexuality in black America is too narrow and dangerously misleading so it is with Donaghy seed coats his worldview he says Coates rightly highlights the vicious legacy of white supremacy past and president past and present he sees it everywhere and everyone and ever reminds us of its plundering effects unfortunately he hardly keeps track of our fight back and never connects this ugly legacy to the predatory capitalist practices Imperial policies or the black elites refusal to confront poverty patriarchy or transphobia in short coats fetishizes white supremacy he makes it all mighty magical and unremovable so this is kind of hilarious taani he see Coates is now being ripped by Cornel West and Richard Spencer the white supremacist is agreeing with Cornel West against Tony he's he coats and now Tony he's he coats has suspended his he has suspended his Twitter account in response to all of this Cornel West is not wrong by the way that quote that that on t he C code sees white supremacy hiding under the bed it's just the Cornel West is even more of a Marxist and then he is a racial conflict so watching these sorts of in fights is entertaining to say the least because both of them are wrong just in in slightly different ways other things that I like so I just had to laugh at this so President Trump is now been entered into Disney's Hall of Presidents and let's just say it is not good it does not look my President Trump do you have any video by Donald John Trump do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States okay that is that look at that picture of Donald John Trump look just in the face forget the hair whose face is that that's Hillary Clinton's face it really looks a lot as though Disney made this doll of Hillary Clinton turn it male it does look at anything like Trump I mean it said this one goes in the you know I I have a great love for bad sculpture and this one goes in the bad sculpture Hall of Fame so well done Disney putting Donald Trump in the Hall of Presidents is in and of itself highly entertaining that's pretty spectacular okay time for a quick thing that I hate CNN's Chris Cuomo who he's got to be the thickest guy on cable TV and that's saying a lot there are a lot of thick people on cable TV and I don't mean that isn't like the the rap sexy thing I mean like dumb Chris Cuomo Chris Cuomo was criticizing president Trump's drinking technique like this is what we've come to now the president from throwing a speech he reaches over he picks up his glass of water he doesn't a weird way is gonna pick up the glass and drink it he takes it with both hands kind of sips it and then puts it back down and this turns into a four-minute segment on CNN the president reached for a glass of water during his national security speech and Twitter took note it has led to comparisons of how the president needs to use two hands apparently to drink from a water bottle he did that during the speech last month and then again yesterday the water works with the president started the waterworks started with the campaign of course when he poked fun at Senator Marco Rubio for pausing mid-sentence for some water but this wasn't even smaller glass yesterday where he used two hands I believe last time you called it the baby grip well that is the sippy cup grip that you're using there right now it is a very good I don't get all the hands thing in the glass you know I don't I don't know what it's all about it this is what I drink out I drink out of them and I hold it like a man with one hand but that's you know that's that's me right that's and I'm just a giant certainly not one of us this concerns you want to hold the cup with all your hands you don't you that's what you do what a sippy cup grip so there's a and then you wonder why Trump's those fake news all the time this is wise from sis fake news not because its faith that that's a weird way to grip a cup but because like why is this on the news at all maybe the Twitter is a funny place and there's lots of funny stuff on Twitter I engage in it on a regular basis but um I'm not really certain that this is appropriate CNN commentary okay finally let's do a little bit of Bible talk so there's a lot of talk from the left today about how it is unbiblical it is just terrible that we are not talking about centralizing government centralized government is is is dedicating like God wants government to create that the tendency for fairness so this is a section from the book of Judges I believe this chapter 8 of the book of Judges and talks about the rule of Gideon so Gideon was of course a prophet in Israel and he leads his men in a fight against the Philistines and other groups that are that are oppressing the Israelites and here's what it says says then the men of Israel said to Gideon rule over us both you and your son also your son son for you have saved us from the hand of Midian and Gideon said to them I shall not rule over you and my son will not rule over you the Lord will rule over you right which is a pretty astonishing statement the Bible is at best ambivalent about monarchy like really ambivalent about monarchy Moses warns that it's not going to be good Samuel Schmo it warns in in 1 Samuel 1st Samuel we call Schmo Oliphant Hebrew which is why I hesitate on the English translation in in shuo if Samuel gives an entire lecture to the people about why it's gonna suck once they point to King now you have this in the book of Judges where Gideon says rule yourselves basically don't have a centralized government that rules over you the idea of a theocratic government that is centralized from the very top is not really well spelled out in in the Old Testament at all and it's not spelled out well in the New Testament either I mean the idea of render unto Caesar in the New Testament is very much reflective of the basic Jewish idea of Dina DeMarco sadena which literally means the law of the land is the law and insofar as it doesn't conflicted the law of God you have to obey it what's fascinating about this section with regard to Gideon is not just that he says that he's not going to rule over the people that they have to rule themselves that God is gonna rule over them he says I would make a request of you that you give me every man the nose ring of his spoil for they had to go nose-rings because they were Ishmaelites and they said we shall willingly give and they spread out the garment and every man there and through the nose ring of his spoil and then gideon takes all of these rings and then he makes in a phone which is a breastplate and he said it's his up in his home city and it says then all israel went astray after it there and it became a snare to gideon into his house the importance of this the reason this matters is when a group of people decide to collectively pool their labor and make something you have to be very careful they don't begin to worship the thing that they make and this is true of the american government we're very proud of our of our government we're very proud of our system of government we're proud of Washington DC the big buildings and how pretty it is in all of us but it's very easy for us to start worshipping the thing that we have made with our own hands and to suggest that it has some sort of outsized power even though we are the ones that made it and to suggest that people in the future need to throw their nose rings into the into the pot as well that's not the way the American government was meant to be built it's not the way that that it even was in the Bible there's a reason the Bible says that this becomes a snare to the leaders it becomes a snare to the people collective collective action must be taken from time to time but the key there is from time to time ok we'll be back here tomorrow with more notes on all the fallout and Ben Shapiro there's the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring
