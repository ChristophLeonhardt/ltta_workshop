OF QUESTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT,

5
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,304
WE NEED TO ASK WHO STANDS THE

6
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:18,071
MOST TO GAIN?

7
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:19,807
THE FORMER ASSISTANT TO BOB

8
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:21,375
MUELLER BLAMED PRESIDENT TRUMP

9
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,644
FOR THE LEAK BUT TRUMP BLASTED

10
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:27,748
THE LEAK HIMSELF IN A TWEET

11
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:28,916
EARLIER TODAY.

12
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,084
A REPORT IN THE WASHINGTON

13
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:33,120
POST SUGGESTED THE LEAKED LIST

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,923
MAYBE A SERIES OF REQUESTS

15
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:37,291
COMBINED BY A TRUMP ATTORNEY.

16
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,458
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A LIST OF

17
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,827
QUESTIONS THE PRESIDENT'S

18
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:41,495
LEGAL TEAM BELIEVED TRUMP

19
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:43,730
WOULD BE ASKED, KIND OF A MOOT

20
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,165
COURT SITUATION.

21
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:47,134
LET'S ASK TWO TOP LEGAL MINDS

22
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,502
WHY THEY THINK THE LIST WAS

23
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:49,403
LEAKED.

24
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:50,671
FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE

25
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,607
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND

26
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:57,277
FORMER WHITEWATER DEPUTY

27
00:00:57,277 --> 00:00:58,145
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL.

28
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:01,315
THE INTRIGUE, JOE, ABOUT WHO

29
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:01,849
LEAKED WHAT.

30
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:03,483
WHO HAS MOTIVE.

31
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:05,117
LIKE COLUMBO.

32
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:06,353
>> I ACTUALLY DON'T CARE.

33
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:07,554
I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS

34
00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:08,689
THESE ARE CLEARLY THE TYPE OF

35
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:09,389
QUESTIONS DISCUSSED BETWEEN

36
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:11,358
THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM AND

37
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:12,926
MR. MUELLER, AND THE QUESTION,

38
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:16,163
WHAT DO THESE QUESTIONS SAY?

39
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:19,299
THEY SAY THE INVESTIGATION IS

40
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,868
NOW LURCHING INTO TERRITORY

41
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:25,239
PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION,

42
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,240
THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGES

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,208
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

44
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,743
STATES AND MUELLER, LET'S

45
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:30,744
ASSUME THE QUESTIONS ARE

46
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:31,712
ACCURATE THAT. THIS IS WHAT

47
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:32,546
MUELLER WANTS TO ASK.

48
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,581
IF THEY ARE, AND IF HE INSISTS

49
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,784
ON ANSWERS, AND WILL NOT

50
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,287
ACCEPT A WRITTEN ANSWER AND

51
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:41,555
DEMANDS AN INTERVIEW, WHICH

52
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:42,923
THE PRESIDENT REJECTS, AND

53
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:45,392
THEN MUELLER INSISTS ON A

54
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,728
SPEEN , WE'RE HEAD TODAY A --

55
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:48,962
SUBPOENA, WE'RE HEAD TODAY A

56
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:49,696
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS BECAUSE

57
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:50,797
THE PRESIDENT WON'T ANSWER

58
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:52,165
THESE QUESTIONS UNDER ANY SET

59
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,200
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

60
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,435
>> WHEN I SAW TONIGHT THIS

61
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:57,938
REPORT IN THE POST ABOUT THE

62
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:59,606
PRESIDENTIAL SUBPOENA, YOU

63
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:02,409
KNOW IT TAKES KIND OF A LOT TO

64
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:03,911
SHOCK ME THESE DAYS IN

65
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:06,146
WASHINGTON BUT I TOOK A COUPLE

66
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:07,581
EXTRA BREATHS THERE.

67
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:08,282
YOUR REACTION.

68
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:12,252
>> I'M NOT SURE.

69
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,655
I SAW THE, I'M NOT SURE I SAW

70
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:15,322
THE POSTING.

71
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:16,757
IS IT ALREADY ISSUED?

72
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:18,492
>> NO APPARENTLY MUELLER

73
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:19,660
RAISED THE POSSIBILITY WITH

74
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,161
THE TRUMP LEGAL TEAM

75
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:21,561
REPORTEDLY.

76
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,696
>> I THINK JOE IS ABSOLUTELY

77
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:23,730
RIGHT.

78
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,766
IF, IF PRESIDENT TRUMP DECIDES

79
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,567
NOT TO SIT IN FOR THE

80
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:28,969
INTERVIEW AND ANSWER THE

81
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,704
QUESTIONS, AND THESE ARE VERY

82
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:31,905
BROAD QUESTIONS THAT

83
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:33,707
DEFINITELY RAISE ISSUES OF

84
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,575
BOTH EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND

85
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,077
SEPARATION OF POWERS, IF HE

86
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:39,046
DECLINES TO ANSWER AND MUELLER

87
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:41,748
ISSUES A SUBPOENA, YOU KNOW,

88
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:43,850
IT'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF

89
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,285
DOES TRUMP INVOKE THE FIFTH OR

90
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:46,987
GO TO THE GRAND JIRX HE'LL GO

91
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,288
AND LITIGATE THIS ISSUE AND

92
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:49,990
HERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

93
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,291
INTERESTING THAT I DON'T

94
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,392
BELIEVE ANYBODY HAS TALKED

95
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:53,293
ABOUT.

96
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:54,661
REMEMBER, IN THE WATERGATE

97
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:56,997
YEARS, YOU HAD U.S. VERSUS

98
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:58,332
NIXON WHERE THE SUPREME COURT

99
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,367
REJECTED PRESIDENT NIXON'S

100
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,936
BLANKET CLAIMS OF EXECUTIVE

101
00:03:02,936 --> 00:03:04,204
PRIVILEGE, BUT IN THAT

102
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:05,772
DECISION, THEY POINTED OUT

103
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:09,743
THAT LEON JAWORSKI, THE

104
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:11,745
SPECIAL COUNSEL, HAD BEEN

105
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:13,380
EXPLICITLY GRANTED THE POWER

106
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,482
TO CON SEX EXECUTIVE

107
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:15,882
PRIVILEGE.

108
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:17,384
I'M NOT SURE BOB MUELLER HAS

109
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:18,785
THE POWER UNDER HIS

110
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:21,788
APPOINTMENT FROM ROSENSTEIN OR

111
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:24,591
THE REGULATION TO GO IN AND

112
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:25,625
CHALLENGE THE EXECUTIVE

113
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,393
PRIVILEGE SO THERE'S A

114
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:28,428
POSSIBLE THIRD WAY FOR THE

115
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:31,431
PRESIDENT TO BOTTLE THIS UP IN

116
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,767
COURT ON THE EXECUTIVE

117
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:34,668
PRIVILEGE ISSUE.

118
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:35,469
>> VERY INTERESTING.

119
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:36,770
I LOVE THAT.

120
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,871
ANY PARTICULAR QUESTIONS IN

>> YES, THE QUESTION POLLSED

124
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:45,979
BY MUELLER ABOUT WHAT WERE YOU

125
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,315
THINKING WHEN YOU FIRED COMEY?

126
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,050
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHEN

127
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,385
YOU FIRED FLYNN?

128
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:53,520
THE NOTION THAT A SPECIAL

129
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,689
COUNSEL CAN INTRUDE ON THE

130
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:58,592
THINKING PROCESS OF A SITTING

131
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,194
PRESIDENT, WHILE HE WAS

137
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:12,039
ME ONE THING ABOUT MUELLER.

138
00:04:12,039 --> 00:00:00,000
HE HAS GONE GOOFY.
