1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry</font>

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:14,800
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die so I imagined the floor</font>

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,480
was a collection plate for the ferryman

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,539
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> do coins of my fair</font>

5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,160
I lay across our I shot and dreamed my

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,390
bed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a cockpit something to die I</font>

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,619
decided that I'd wasted enough of the

8
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,119
world's time and probably took the

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,890
phrase get busy living or get busy dying

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,670
a little too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> to heart I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,879
see the world but with only a pen at a

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,070
page i decided to create my own between

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,800
blue veins contain of an a portion and

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,899
for a while showing that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> live from</font>

15
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mic was the most alive I could</font>

16
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:57,420
be I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live so I wrote my pole</font>

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,369
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked my death wishes in a book</font>

18
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,710
with a spine because someone had to have

19
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,520
one and it definitely wasn't me I wanted

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to live but living and loving two</font>

21
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,140
different things I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be loved so</font>

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,110
I attached myself to her<font color="#E5E5E5"> stayed up</font>

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">nights trying to write poems in her</font>

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,740
honor but ultimately let the page is

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,630
empty I sought to me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself I want it</font>

26
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,680
to be fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> but left the hard way that</font>

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,760
she she wasn't my fix I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,270
home because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said home is where the</font>

29
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,729
heart is and I hadn't felt my bait until

30
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,340
it started beating me up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normal because under the roof</font>

32
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,240

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing something right right I</font>

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,290
