is the new AOL going to be the content publishing platform for the 21st century that is the question Patrick you run associated content you're way ahead of what Tim Armstrong is doing at AOL but Tim actually founded associated content Owens twenty percent of it is what's coming out of AOL is that alarming to you do you think they're going to do something close to what you're doing well I don't know if I'd say it's alarming I mean Tim's a friend and is an investor in the company and I can't say that I'm privy to exactly what the strategy is a day well but I can say for sure and we talked to lots of companies that cost effective content creation is on the minds of everybody on the web today how do I build content that's discoverable that's monetizable and that's unique and how do you do that at massive scale and it does sound a lot like what Tim has been talking about what they're talking about at AOL in terms of content again I'm not sure exactly what his strategy is I can only see what's been said publicly but that's not unique to Tim I think if you look at Yahoo Yahoo if you look at Microsoft if you look at a lot of traditional publishers of content not to mention people like demand and others that are in our space I think everyone is realizing the power of search and discovery of content the power of this kind of content to be able to monetize for an advertiser's perspective and just sort of the cost-effective creation of this kind of content and right now as I understand it the core of what AOL is talking about is basically web blogs which was Jason Calacanis his company and gadget was the lead site obviously a huge leader in this new style of publishing that you have taken where you're not actually employing everybody directly yourself but you're just spreading it around you say 3,000 people can trigger it doesn't add to zero so just a remarkable number of people actually contributing to it right now AOL is still actually managing the production much smaller number of contributors do you think they will open it up and do something like what you're doing I mean I think it's possible I mean I think a lot of people look at our success I mean we've been going at this for about four years now and every important metric to us has grown well north of one hundred percent year-over-year including number of contributors traffic and audience we reach about 27 million unique users a month comscore another issue has this other number a little lower than that but when I look at quantcast and we're number the number 38 site in the u.s. right now and that's been built on a lot of user prosumer generated content and really discoverable information I think a lot of big publishers on the web or realizing that this is a really effective model for creating content and how much of that content will step away for a while for a second is sort of news content versus content as a long shelf life and how to type canta yeah no that's a great question i mean we accept there's a real democracy to how we accept content will accept content from anyone on virtually any topic making sure that again it's protected and has the right right surround it and we do take news content news to be frank is very challenging to monetize you know you have basically three days of value with that product often generates a lot of interest generally it's a lot of page views in traffic but what works best for us is this long shelf life long tail content any piece of content that was created in say 2005 on a homemade halloween costume is as useful today's the day was created so we really like content that looks like that it's really easily found through search it's easy to monetize and its unique news content will take that and we generate a lot of a lot of user interest in traffic in news but again I just think it's really hard to monetize that content so back to AOL big question for AOL leaving aside associated contact you know Tim very well very well is he going to remake this company into something that isn't going to collapse and go to zero well I would never bet against him I mean tim is you know the greatest leader I've ever worked for and I think that he has the kind of smarts to monetize virtually any platform there is a word I keep using but I think it's going to be important for them you know I think they do have some challenges on the product side of the business but you know it's it's not my DNA to ever bet against him and I think he's surrounded himself with a great team I think he's has his work cut out for him it's a product and platform and advertising opportunity that I think a lot of people need to look at again but he's got he's definitely got his work cut out for him and given that it sounds like you're both doing something quite similar and he personally already owns twenty percent of you shouldn't we just put the companies together and call it a day you'll have to ask him that okay thanks Pat
