1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:01,400
APPLIED FOR LOANS TO HELP 

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,601
SUPPLEMENT HIS INCOME, BUT 

3
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:04,537
PROVIDED FALSE INFORMATION TO 

4
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,438
THE BANKS. 

5
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,074
SO FAR THE EIGHT COUNTS THAT 

6
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,442
THE JURY COULD ACTUALLY COME TO 

7
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,342
A DECISION ON ARE ALL GUILTY. 

8
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:14,380
THESE ARE THE FIRST CONVICTIONS 

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:14,980
SECURED BY SPECIAL COUNSEL, 

10
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,381
ROBERT MUELLER. 

11
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:20,152
>> SO, THE 10 COUNTS THAT AT 

12
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:20,853
THIS POINT, THAT THEY CANNOT 

13
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:21,854
COME TO A DECISION ON -- AGAIN, 

14
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,656
IT APPEARS THE JUDGE IS 

15
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:24,858
PROCEEDING -- I'M GOING TO LET 

16
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,492
THEM PROCEED WITH HIS PARTIAL 

17
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:25,759
VERDICT. 

18
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,392
THESE 10 COUNTS WOULD MOSTLY 

19
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:32,165
APPLY TO THE LOANS THAT THE 

20
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:32,799
PROSECUTOR HAD ISSUE WITH HOW 

21
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,637
THEY WERE SECURED? 

22
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,104
>> EXACTLY. 

23
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:38,872
I EVEN COVERED THIS CASE OVER 

24
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,339
THE PAST FEW WEEKS. 

25
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,005
THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE. 

26
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:44,410
THE STRONGEST CASE FOR THE 

27
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,044
PROSECUTION WAS THE TAX FRAUD. 

28
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:45,778
THAT IS IN MANY WAYS A 

29
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:46,178
PAPERWORK CRIME. 

30
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:47,046
IT WAS SUPPORTED BY A 

31
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,647
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PAPER 

32
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,748
EVIDENCE, SUPPORTED BY DOZENS 

33
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,683
OF WITNESSES THAT THE JURY 

34
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:50,983
HEARD FROM. 

35
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:54,387
BUT, WE SAW THE QUESTIONS THAT 

36
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:54,954
THE JURY SUBMITTED LAST 

37
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:55,554
THURSDAY, SUGGESTING THEY HAD 

38
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,857
CONCERNS ABOUT HIS FAILURE TO 

39
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,227
DISCLOSE THIRD -- CERTAIN 

40
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:01,794
FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS, AND 

41
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:02,294
WHETHER HE REALLY DID 

42
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:03,229
INTENTIONALLY FAILED TO 

43
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,831
DISCLOSE THEM, OR WHETHER THEY 

44
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,431
BELIEVE THE DEFENSE'S THEORY, 

45
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:09,035
WHICH IS THAT HE FARMED THIS 

46
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:09,702
OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE, INCLUDING 

47
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,370
HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATE, RICHARD 

48
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:10,603
GATES. 

49
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,173
IT APPEARS THAT THE JURY 

50
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:13,873
BELIEVES THERE WAS REASONABLE 

51
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,308
DOUBT ABOUT THOSE CHARGES. 

52
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,843
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FACT THAT 

53
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,479
HE APPLIED FOR LOANS IN THE -- 

54
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,080
PROVIDED FALSE INFORMATION. 

55
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,150
EACH OF THESE LOANS WAS A 

56
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,683
DIFFERENT SET OF FACTS. 

57
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:25,418
IT APPEARS THAT SOME PEOPLE 

58
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,719
COULD BELIEVE THERE WAS IN FACT 

59
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,087
REASONABLE DOUBT ABOUT WHETHER 

60
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:33,726
OR NOT HE COMMITTED BRING -- 

61
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,394
BANK FRAUD FOR THOSE LOANS. 

62
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,462
SO, THIS VERDICT IS NOT A HUGE 

63
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,932
SURPRISE, HAVING BEEN IN THE 

64
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,899
COURTROOM OVER THE PAST FEW 

65
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:40,132
WEEKS. 

66
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:41,267
>> PAULA, OKAY -- SO, IF YOU 

67
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,602
ARE ROBERT MUELLER RIGHT NOW, 

68
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,435
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING BASED ON 

69
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:44,170
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING? 

70
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,408
ALSO, IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT 

71
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,210
TRUMP ? 

72
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,043
>> IF YOU ARE ROBERT MUELLER, I 

73
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,111
THINK THAT HE WOULD SAY -- YOU 

74
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,411
KNOW WHAT? 

75
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,113
I WILL TAKE IT. 

76
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,081
THE COUNTS THAT WE ALL GOT WERE 

77
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:55,315
GUILTY. 

78
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:55,949
THERE IS ANOTHER TRIAL COMING 

79
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,851
UP FOR MR. MANAFORT IN DECEMBER 

80
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:05,892
ON SIMILAR CHARGES. 

81
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,893
THIS WILL FOCUS MORE ON THE 

82
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:07,727
KIND OF WORK THAT HE WAS DOING, 

83
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,494
ON HIS LOBBYING WORK. 

84
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:09,193
THAT HE FAILED TO DISCLOSE THAT 

85
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:10,763
HE WAS DOING IT ON BEHALF OF A 

86
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,165
PRO UKRAINIAN POLITICIAN. 

87
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:12,799
THIS IS MORE ABOUT HIS 

88
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,532
FINANCES, HIS INCOME, AND THE 

89
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:15,268
FACT THAT HE ALLEGEDLY FAILED 

90
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,569
TO DISCLOSE SOME OF IT. 

91
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,041
SO, HERE ROBERT MUELLER IS 

92
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,076
SAYING -- YOU KNOW WHAT, I WILL 

93
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:23,409
TAKE US. 

94
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,076
IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU 

95
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,044
WILL SEIZE ON THE FACT THAT THE 

96
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,714
JURY COULD NOT COME TO  A 

97
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,348
CONSENSUS ON THE MAJORITY OF 

98
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:28,681
THESE COUNTS. 

99
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,449
IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT, YOU 

100
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,918
WILL . OUTÃƒPOINT OUT THAT THE 

101
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:37,156
GOVERNMENT SPOKE TO GATES 

102
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,191
SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND CHOSE NOT 

103
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:38,591
TO BRING CHARGES. 

104
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,392
HE WILL HAMMER ON THE FACT THAT 

105
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,859
THEY CANNOT COME TO A CONSENSUS 

106
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:44,297
AND CONTINUE TO PUSH THE 

107
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,031
ARGUMENT, THAT THIS IS A 

108
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:45,498
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED 

109
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:45,832
PROSECUTION. 

110
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,233
IT IS ALSO NOW UP TO PRESIDENT 

111
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,401
TRUMP  IF HE WANTS TO PARDON 

112
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,736
HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN ON 

113
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:55,675
THESE CONVICTIONS. 

114
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,409
>> A DIVIDED COUNTRY, A DIVIDED 

115
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:56,809
VERDICT SO FAR. 

116
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,710
LET'S CHECK IN WITH MAJOR 

117
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,277
GARRETT, AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

118
00:02:58,277 --> 00:02:59,979
WITH MORE ON ALL OF THIS.  

119
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,447
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, TELL US 

120
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,915
WHAT YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU ARE 

121
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:08,488
SEEING HERE. 

122
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,188
>> WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE WILL 

123
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,056
SAY WHAT PAULA SAID, THAT ALL 

124
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:10,623
OF THESE CHARGES, THE 

125
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,124
CONVICTIONS, DEAL WITH 

126
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,091
FINANCIAL CRIMES. 

127
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,028
NOW, IF CONVICTED PAULA -- PAUL 

128
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,662
MANAFORT HAS BEEN -- IT HAD 

129
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:22,068
NOTHING TO DO WITH WORKING 

130
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:22,768
AROUND PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HIS 

131
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:23,035
CAMPAIGN. 

132
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:23,870
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TRIED TO 

133
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,437
PUT AS MUCH DISTANCE AS 

134
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,037
POSSIBLE BETWEEN THESE LEGAL 

135
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:25,538
PROCEEDINGS  AND PAUL 

136
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,772
MANAFORT'S WORK AS GENERAL 

137
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:28,908
CHAIRMAN FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 

138
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,309
AND A VITAL PART OF THAT 

139
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:36,950
CAMPAIGN FROM MAY-JULY, CRUCIAL 

140
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,351
TO SECURING AND THEN HOLDING 

141
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,919
ALL OF THE DELEGATES NECESSARY 

142
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,855
TO MAKE DONALD TRUMP THE 

143
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,288
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. 

144
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:45,858
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SAID IT IS 

145
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,896
UNFAIR TO TAR THE PRESIDENT 

146
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,530
WITH THESE FINANCIAL MISDEEDS 

147
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,530
OF PAUL MANAFORT THAT OCCURRED 

148
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,800
LONG BEFORE THAT POLITICAL 

149
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,233
ACTIVITY. 

150
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,535
AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH FOR THIS 

151
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:02,842
WHITE HOUSE -- PAUL MANAFORT 

152
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,375
IMPLICATED AND CONVICTED. 

153
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,177
AND NOW RICK GATES WHO WAS A 

154
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,277
WITNESS IN THIS TRIAL AND 

155
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:08,247
ADMITTED TO MISDEEDS, BOTH WERE 

156
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:08,847
CENTRAL FIGURES IN THE TRUMP 

157
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:09,114
CAMPAIGN. 

158
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:09,949
EVEN AFTER PAUL MANAFORT LEFT 

159
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,951
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, RICK GATES 

160
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:17,957
STAYED ON. 

161
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,690
ALL THROUGH THE FALL CAMPAIGN. 

162
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,425
THEN, HE WAS A SIGNIFICANT 

163
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,426
FUNDRAISER IN DECISION-MAKER 

164
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,662
WITHIN THE PRESIDENT'S 

165
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,162
INAUGURATION COMMITTEE. 

166
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,230
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

167
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,832
ADMITTED TO WRONGDOING. ONE 

168
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,166
CONVICTED OF IT, PAUL MANAFORT, 

169
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,936
WHO DID HAVE SIGNIFICANT ROLES 

170
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,436
IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 

171
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,739
TRY AS THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TO 

172
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,539
DISTANCE ITSELF FROM WHO PAUL 

173
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,007
MANAFORT IS, AND WHAT HE DID, 

174
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,910
AND WHAT HE IS ALLEGED TO HAVE 

175
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,515
DONE, AND NOW CONVICTED OF, 

176
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,182
THESE TWO STORIES DO CO-MINGLE. 

177
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,951
THE PRESIDENT IS FLYING TO WEST 

178
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,218
VIRGINIA. 

179
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,352
I GUARANTEE YOU HIS EYES ARE ON 

180
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,654
ANOTHER LEGAL MATTER IN NEW 

181
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:53,826
YORK -- MICHAEL COHEN ABOUT 

182
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:54,894
READY TO PLEA TO OTHER CHARGES 

183
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:55,828
THAT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT 

184
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,798
REPERCUSSIONS  AND IMPLICATIONS 

185
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:00,432
FOR THE PRESIDENT, NOT JUST 

186
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,033
LEGALLY, BUT POLITICALLY. 

187
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:01,867
>> WE WILL TAKE A PICTURE OF 

188
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,669
THE COURTHOUSE IN NEW YORK WHERE

189
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,071
MICHAEL COHEN IS PLEADING 

190
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,773
GUILTY  ON THIS REMARKABLE 

191
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:15,748
LEGAL AFTERNOON WITH BOTH 

192
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,382
MICHAEL COHEN PLEADING GUILTY 

193
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,049
AND NOW PAUL MANAFORT, AT LEAST 

194
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:20,420
FOUND GUILTY ON SOME CHARGES, 

195
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,654
8/18  COUNTS IN HIS FRAUD 

196
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:21,887
TRIAL. 

197
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:22,421
YOU ARE LOOKING AT LOWER 

198
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:22,988
MANHATTAN HERE RIGHT NOW. 

199
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:23,823
THIS WAS A CASE THAT WAS 

200
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,424
REFERRED TO THE SOUTHERN 

201
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,292
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK BY ROBERT 

202
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,694
MUELLER'S TEAM. WE ARE WAITING 

203
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,129
TO GET MORE DETAILS ON EXACTLY 

204
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,000
WHAT THE CHARGES THAT MICHAEL 

205
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,668
COHEN IS PLEADING GUILTY TO --  

206
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,536
MAYBE WE CAN CIRCLE BACK TO 

207
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,437
PAULA REID  WHO IS IN VIRGINIA 

208
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:45,411
BUT HAS COVERED THE MICHAEL 

209
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:45,945
COHEN CASE EXTENSIVELY. 

210
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,012
PAULA, IF YOU ARE WITH US -- I 

211
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:47,947
KNOW THAT YOU ARE WAITING FOR A 

212
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,215
LOT OF INFORMATION HERE ON PAUL 

213
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:49,515
MANAFORT.  

214
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,450
WHAT IS YOUR GUIDE AND SO FAR 

215
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,350
ON MICHAEL COHEN IN THIS PLEA?  

216
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,754
>> Reporter: WE EXPECT THIS PLEA

217
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,222
DEAL WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY 

218
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,256
COOPERATION AGAINST THE 

219
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:57,556
PRESIDENT. 

220
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:58,925
HE IS NOT FLIPPING. 

221
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,125
THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE A 

222
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:04,831
STRAIGHT PLEA DEAL, THE KIND 

223
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,531
THAT YOU WOULD SEE WITH MANY 

224
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,132
DEFENDANTS GOING TO FEDERAL 

225
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:06,365
COURT. 

226
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:09,135
HE IS GOING TO PLEAD GUILTY TO 

227
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:09,902
SEVERAL CHARGES WHICH WE EXPECT 

228
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,370
WILL BE TAX FRAUD AND SOME 

229
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,107
CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION, AND 

230
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:15,942
SOURCES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE 

231
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,542
WATCH CAREFULLY ON WHAT HE 

232
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,844
ADMITS TO IN CONNECTION WITH 

233
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:23,182
THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION. 

234
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:23,849
AS YOU MAY REMEMBER, THE 

235
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:24,483
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN 

236
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,117
INVESTIGATING MR. MICHAEL COHEN 

237
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:25,751
FOR POSSIBLE CAMPAIGN FINANCE 

238
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:26,385
VIOLATION  RELATED TO CERTAIN 

239
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:31,424
HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS THAT HE 

240
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,191
NEGOTIATED TO KEEP WOMEN QUIET 

241
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,758
ABOUT THEIR ALLEGED AFFAIRS 

242
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:33,225
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 

243
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,427
SO, THIS WILL NOT REQUIRE HIS 

244
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,496
COOPERATION AGAINST THE 

245
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:38,163
PRESIDENT OR ANYONE ELSE, BUT 

246
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:38,797
IT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, 

247
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,032
DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS OF 

248
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,535
WHAT HE IS ADMITTING IN 

249
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,235
CONNECTION TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE 

250
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:43,536
VIOLATION. 

251
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:49,542
>> OKAY, SO AS YOU SAID, 

252
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,142
MICHAEL:NOT FLIPPING ON THE 

253
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:50,810
PRESIDENT, BUT THEN THE SPECIAL 

254
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,511
COUNSEL COULD THEN USE THAT 

255
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,111
INFORMATION FROM THE MICHAEL 

256
00:06:52,111 --> 00:07:00,786
COHEN PLEA?  

257
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:01,420
>> Reporter: HE COULD PROVIDE 

258
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,020
INFORMATION BETWEEN THE TIME 

259
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,022
THAT HE PLEASE TODAY, AND WHEN 

260
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:03,622
HE IS SENTENCED IN WEEKS OR 

261
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:03,856
MONTHS. 

262
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,456
THAT COULD HELP SENTENCING. 

263
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,392
BUT, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE 

264
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:06,992
INVESTIGATION TELL ME THAT 

265
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:07,626
MICHAEL COHEN IS CONSIDERED A 

266
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:08,093
PROBLEMATIC WITNESS. 

267
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:08,994
HE IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE  A 

268
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:09,628
VIABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION, 

269
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:13,733
BECAUSEEVEN IF HE WAS TO FLIP, 

270
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,633
IF THEY WERE TO MAKE IT TO 

271
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:15,868
TRIAL, AS YOU SEE HERE IN THE 

272
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,702
MANAFORT CASE, PUT HIM ON THE 

273
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,369
STAND, THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT 

274
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:23,142
HE COULD BE EASILY DISCREDITED 

275
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:23,509
OR UNDERMINED. 

276
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,310
HE IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A 

277
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:24,877
VALUABLE ASSET TO SPECIAL 

278
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:29,081
COUNSEL, BUT IF HE COMES UP 

279
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,815
WITH A PIECE OF PHYSICAL 

280
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:30,349
EVIDENCE OR SOME OTHER 

281
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,083
TESTIMONY THAT HE WANTS TO 

282
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:31,917
OFFER BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN HE 

283
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,953
IS SENTENCED, IT IS POSSIBLE. 

284
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,486
MUELLER COULD TAKE THAT 

285
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:35,120
COOPERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR A 

286
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,588
LIGHTER SENTENCE. 

287
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,458
BUT, AS OF RIGHT NOW, THAT IS 

288
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,426
NOT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND HE HAS 

289
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:40,960
AGREED TO DO. 

290
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,727
>> I'M JUST HEARING THAT WE ARE 

291
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,463
UNDERSTANDING NOW THAT MICHAEL 

292
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,130
COHEN HAS THE GUILTY PLEA AND 

293
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,831
IT INVOLVES A PRISON SENTENCE 

294
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:49,235
UP TO FIVE YEARS . FIVE YEARS 

295
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:49,635
AND THREE MONTHS. 

296
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,537
THAT SOUNDS SIGNIFICANT. 

297
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,973
WHAT ELSE THEN,  WHAT HAPPENS 

298
00:07:54,973 --> 00:08:02,615
NEXT WITH MICHAEL COHEN?  

299
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,282
>> WELL, HE WILL NOT BE 

300
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:03,749
SENTENCED TODAY. 

301
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,517
THIS IS THE DEAL THAT HE HAS 

302
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,117
STRUCK BETWEEN THE JUSTICE 

303
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,118
DEPARTMENT AND DEFENSE 

304
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,287
ATTORNEYS. 

305
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,021
THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL 

306
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:09,855
RECOMMEND TO A JUDGE, BUT A 

307
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:10,722
JUDGE CAN GO HARDER OR LIGHTER. 

308
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,525
IT ALSO DEPENDS ON HIS CONDUCT 

309
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,258
BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN HE IS 

310
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:13,960
SENTENCED. 

311
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,793
BUT, THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DAY. 

312
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:19,732
YOU HAVE TO OF THE PRESIDENTS 

313
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,299
TOP ASSOCIATES IN FEDERAL 

314
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:20,900
COURT, ONE PLEADING GUILTY, 

315
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,268
ANOTHER ONE BEING CONVICTED ON 

316
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,135
8 COUNTS. 

317
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:29,375
>> SO, TELL ME -- MANAFORT 

318
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,176
CONVICTED ON 8/18 COUNTS, WHAT 

319
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,343
HAPPENS TO THE OTHER 10 THEN? 

320
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:36,615
>> HE COULD BE RETRIED, BECAUSE 

321
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:37,149
THIS WAS A MISTRIAL. 

322
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:37,984
BUT, HE HAS ANOTHER TRIAL IN 

323
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:38,284
SEPTEMBER. 

324
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,551
I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE SPECIAL 

325
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,053
COUNSEL WILL WAIT AND SEE HOW 

326
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,054
THAT CASE GOES, AND THEN THEY 

327
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:42,788
WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY 

328
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:48,227
WANT TO SPEND THE RESOURCES TO 

329
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,095
RETRY HIM ON THOSE OTHER 10 

330
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:49,328
COUNTS. 

331
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:49,595
>> OKAY. 

332
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,496
PAULA REID, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

333
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,196
REPORTING ON BOTH STORIES, BACK 

334
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:55,200
TO MAJOR GARRETT.  

335
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,102
MAJOR, AS YOU SIFT THROUGH THIS 

336
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:56,802
LEGAL MAZE OF THIS AFTERNOON, 

337
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:57,436
NOW GETTING NEW INFORMATION ON 

338
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,637
MICHAEL COHEN,  AND HIS GUILTY 

339
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:02,008
PLEA, PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE 

340
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:02,708
FROM DC FOR US. 

341
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,379
>> AS PAULA SAID, WHAT DOES HE 

342
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:06,912
PLEAD TO? 

343
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,114
AND HOW SPECIFIC IS THIS CHARGE 

344
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,951
ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION? 

345
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,718
IS IT ONLY RELATED TO ACTIONS 

346
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,020
MICHAEL COHEN TOOK THAT HAVE NO 

347
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,587
LARGER IMPLICATION FOR 

348
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,554
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S KNOWLEDGE , 

349
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:21,193
EITHER AS A CANDIDATE OR 

350
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:21,493
PRESIDENT? 

351
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:22,294
OR, DOES IT SUGGEST THAT HE DID 

352
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:23,362
KNOW ABOUT IT? 

353
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,396
IF IT DOES, THAT WILL UNDERMINE 

354
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:25,364
THE PRESIDENTS SHARP DENIALS 

355
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,499
THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT 

356
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:31,436
THIS, AND IT COULD PLACE HIM IN 

357
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,137
SOME FORM OF LEGAL JEOPARDY. 

358
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:33,506
THOSE I HAVE TALKED TO AT THE 

359
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,340
WHITE HOUSE ARE MUCH MORE 

360
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,608
AFRAID OF THE POLITICAL 

361
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,509
RAMIFICATIONS. 

362
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,180
IF MICHAEL:HE SAYS SOMETHING 

363
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,814
THAT SUGGESTS THE PRESIDENT HAS 

364
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,481
BEEN LESS THAN TRUTHFUL ABOUT 

365
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,516
THIS, THAT COULD DAMAGE HIM 

366
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,417
POLITICALLY MORE SO THAN 

367
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:44,817
LEGALLY. 

368
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,720
>> OKAY, MAJOR GARRETT, THANK 

369
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,255
YOU VERY MUCH. 

370
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,089

LEGAL DRAMAS THAT HAVE  BEEN

PLAYING OUT FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS 

373
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,994

374
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,729
A CONCLUSION WITHIN AN HOUR OF 

375
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,462
EACH OTHER, THAT IS PAUL

MANAFORT BEING FOUND GUILTY ON

00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,577
YOU JUST HEARD. PAUL MANAFORT 

400
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:48,647
HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON 8/18 

401
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,248
COUNTS AGAINST HIM. 

402
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,317
THIS IS THE FIRST TRIAL VICTORY 

403
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,687
FOR THE ROBERT MUELLER 

404
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:56,054
INVESTIGATION.

408
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,727
MANAFORT WAS FOUND GUILTY ON 

409
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:06,498

BANK FRAUD CHARGES, AND ONE OF 

411
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,300
THE FOUR CHARGES RELATED TO 

412
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,003
FAILING TO DISCLOSE FOREIGN 

413
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,370

LEGAL ANALYST,  RICKY KLEEMAN. 

416
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:18,611
THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH US. 

417
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,578
THERE IS A LOT GOING ON RIGHT 

418
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:19,811
NOW. 

419
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:22,114
WE HAVE THE PAUL MANAFORT 

420
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,048
VERDICT, BUT WE HAVE ALSO HEARD 

421
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,584
AT THE SAME TIME THAT MICHAEL 

422
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,086
COHEN HAS PLEADED GUILTY TO A 

423
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:27,753
POSSIBLE PLEA BARGAIN  THAT 

424
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:31,690
INCLUDES A SENTENCE OF UP TO 

425
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,290
FIVE YEARS AND THREE MONTHS, 

426
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,392
THAT IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT, 

427
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:37,863
ISN'T IT? 

428
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,831
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION IT IS 

429
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,164
SIGNIFICANT. 

430
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:39,899
IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS YOU 

431
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,903
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THEY COULD

432
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:44,570
HAVE DONE WITH MICHAEL COHEN 

433
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,538
WHAT THE PROSECUTION DID WITH 

434
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,906
PAUL MANAFORT,  WHICH IS TAKE 

435
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,674
EVERY SINGLE THING THAT THEY 

436
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,110
BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL COHEN HAS 

437
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,281
DONE WRONG,  AND STACK THEM. 

438
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,114
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE 

439
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:57,650
THAN FIVE YEARS THREE MONTHS. 

440
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,418
WHILE I SAY THAT, I WOULD NOT 

441
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:05,491
LIKE TO DO ONE DAY IN JAIL, LET 

442
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,258
ALONE A STATE PRISON, LET ALONE 

443
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,226
FIVE YEARS AND THREE MONTHS, 

444
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,460
BUT THAT APPEARS TO BE THE 

445
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,496
CEILING THAT THE PROSECUTION 

446
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,867
HAS RECOMMENDED, FIVE YEARS 

447
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,267
THREE MONTHS. 

448
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,503
SO, IT IS REALLY UP TO MICHAEL 

449
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:17,903
COHEN.  

450
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,937
IS HE GOING TO TOUGH IT OUT AND 

451
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,339
DO THE FIVE YEARS THREE MONTHS 

452
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,742
MINUS TIME FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR? 

453
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:27,046
OR, IS HE GOING TO MAKE A 

454
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,080
DECISION TODAY, TOMORROW, OR 

455
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,414
PERHAPS EVEN WHEN HE IS IN 

456
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:32,150
PRISON OF JUST SAYING -- THIS 

457
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,386
LIFE IS NOT FOR ME, I THINK 

458
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,522
THAT I WILL COOPERATE FURTHER. 

459
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,226
IF I COOPERATE FURTHER, I GET 

460
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:40,593
SOME TIME OFF. 

461
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,230
>> SO, RICKY, AT RISK OF 

462
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,064
STATING THE OBVIOUS -- I WOULD 

463
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,565
LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ROBERT 

464
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,900
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION HAS 

465
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,034
BORNE SERIOUS FOR TODAY. 

466
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:54,340
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO READ A 

467
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,007
STATEMENT OF US SENATOR MARK 

468
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:55,641
WARNER WHO SAYS THIS VERDICT 

469
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:02,615
MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT 

470
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,349
THE ROBERT MUELLER PROBE IS NOT 

471
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,216
A WITCHHUNT, IT IS A SERIOUS 

472
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:04,850
INVESTIGATION THAT IS ROOTING 

473
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,417
OUT CORRUPTION AND RUSSIAN 

474
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,585
INFLUENCE ON OUR POLITICAL 

475
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:06,819
SYSTEM. 

476
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:07,486
SO, RICKY, WILL TODAY'S VERDICT 

477
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,922
BE ENOUGH TO PUT TO BED THE 

478
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,691
CALLS OF THE INVESTIGATION 

479
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,859
BEING A WITCHHUNT? 

480
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:14,493
>> NO. 

481
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,830
I ASSUME THAT WE WILL HEAR FROM 

482
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,698
DONALD TRUMP, VIA TWITTER, IT 

483
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:25,504
IS NOT -- IF NOT MOMENTARILY, 

484
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:25,871
CERTAINLY SOON. 

485
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,805
I THINK THAT WHAT YOU WILL FIND 

486
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,940
IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL 

487
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,377
SAY LOOK, IT IS ONE THING THAT 

488
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:39,451
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF TAX 

489
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,185
FRAUD COUNTS, THIS PRECEDED HIS 

490
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:40,853
TIME ON THE CAMPAIGN. 

491
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:41,887
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 

492
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:42,954
CAMPAIGN, OR COLLUSION, OR 

493
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:46,825
RUSSIA, AND THAT THE RUSSIA 

494
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,793
COLLUSION INVESTIGATION REMAINS 

495
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,129
A WITCHHUNT. 

496
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:50,996
WE WILL HEA THAT, NO DOUBT 

497
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,463
FROM THE PRESIDENT. 

498
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,432
WE WILL ALSO HEAR IT FROM HIS 

499
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:53,732
SURROGATES. 

500
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,401
I'M SURE THAT THIS EVENING WE 

501
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,903
WILL HEAR IT ON FOX NEWS. 

502
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,972
SO, WHEN YOU GET A VERDICT OF 

503
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:06,045
8/18, YOU HAVE TO WINNERS INTO 

504
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:06,679
LOSERS IN THIS SITUATION, YOU 

505
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,847
HAVE THE GOVERNMENT SAYING -- 

506
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,547
LOOK, WE CONVICTED HIM OF EIGHT 

507
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,484
COUNTS, IT IS ALL THE TAX 

508
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,485
CRIMES, IT IS ALSO THE BANK 

509
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,855
FRAUD COUNT, AND WE ARE DEALING 

510
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:21,026
WITH THE FACT OF THE LOANS THAT 

511
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:21,626
STARTED TO APPROACH THE TIME 

512
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:22,994
THAT HE WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN. 

513
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:24,663
AND, THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL 

514
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,298
SAY -- WE WERE SUCCESSFUL, AND 

515
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:28,033
THEN YOU WILL HAVE THE 

516
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,001
ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR 

517
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,772
SURROGATES SAYING -- NO, LOOK 

518
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,639
AT WHAT HE WAS CONVICTED OF? 

519
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,473
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 

520
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:35,707
RUSSIA. 

521
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,877
SO, BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO 

522
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,810
CLAIM THEIR OWN KIND OF 

523
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,077
VICTORY. 

524
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,479
>> YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT PAUL 

525
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:44,984
MANAFORT AND THE DEFENSE HAVE 

526
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:45,651
AND COUNTING ON A PRESIDENTIAL 

527
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:45,885
PARDON. 

528
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,552
IS THAT LIKELY TO COME HERE? 

529
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,853
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE 

530
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,489
EVIDENCE HERE AGAIN, YOU HAVE 

531
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,690
SEEN THE INDICTMENT, THE TAX 

532
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,791
FRAUD EVIDENCE IS PRETTY 

533
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,024
STRONG. 

534
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,260
WOULD IT SERVE THE PRESIDENT TO 

535
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,898
PARDON PAUL MANAFORT IN ANY WAY?

536
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:00,732
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT MAY FEEL 

537
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:02,401
THAT HE WANTS TO WAIT FOR THE 

538
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,603
WASHINGTON TRIAL, AND AT THE 

539
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,404
END OF THE TWO TRIALS, IF THERE 

540
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:10,342
IS NO TIME LIMIT ON 

541
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:10,976
PRESIDENTIAL POWER OF PARDON, 

542
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:11,610
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY DECIDE 

543
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,778
AT A LATER DATE THAT HE WANTS 

544
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:13,311
TO PARDON PAUL MANAFORT. 

545
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,780
HE HAS TO ALSO ASSUME THAT HE 

546
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:21,120
WILL HAVE TO PAY -- TAKE SOME 

547
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,720
POLITICAL FALLOUT AND PRAISE 

548
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,121
FOR THE DECISION. 

549
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,156
KEEP THIS IN MIND -- IF THERE 

550
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,927
IS TAX FRAUD ON THE FEDERAL 

551
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,763
LEVEL BY VIRTUE OF THAT, THERE 

552
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,565
WAS ALSO TAX FRAUD AT THE STATE 

553
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,033
LEVEL. 

554
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,768
SO, IF THE STATE WANTS TO GO 

555
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:40,706
AHEAD AND CHARGE THE TAX FRAUD, 

556
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,174
OR THE STATE WANTS TO GO AHEAD 

557
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,810
AND LOOK AT IF THERE ARE STATE 

558
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,913
CRIMES INVOLVING ANY OF THESE 

559
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,681
TYPES OF CRIMES THAT WOULD NOT 

560
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:53,218
BE DOUBLE JEOPARDY. 

561
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,453
THE STATE, WHETHER IT IS 

562
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,388
VIRGINIA OR NEW YORK, COULD GO 

563
00:15:57,388 --> 00:16:02,094
FORWARD AND LOOK AT ITS OWN 

564
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:02,328
CRIME. 

565
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,729
IF THAT HAPPENS, THE PRESIDENT 

566
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,863
CANNOT PARDON STATE CRIMES. 

567
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,866
THUS FAR, NO STATE HAS CHOSEN 

568
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,969
TO GO FORWARD AND CHARGE PAUL 

569
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,305
MANAFORT WITH A CRIME. 

570
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,172
THE PRESIDENT HAS CERTAINLY 

571
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:18,077
MADE ENOUGH NOISE IN HIS RECENT 

572
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,613
COMMENTARY ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT 

573
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,181
BEING A GOOD GUY. 

574
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,615
THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS A 

575
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,016
WITCHHUNT. 

576
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:29,088
THAT, EVEN WHEN ASKED IF HE WAS 

577
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:29,788
GOING TO PARDON PAUL MANAFORT, 

578
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:39,098
HE HAD SAID WE WILL SEE WHAT 

579
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:39,364
HAPPENS. 

580
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:40,032
>> WRIGHT, BECAUSE HE IS ALSO 

581
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,033
-- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN HE HAS 

582
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:41,633
DISTANCED HIMSELF AS WELL. 

583
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,668
HE SAID ALL THIS HAPPENED WAY 

584
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,435
BEFORE HE WAS WORKING FOR ME. 

585
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,336
SO, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN HE 

586
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,003
SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS 

587
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:45,671
WASHING HIS HANDS OF PAUL 

588
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,705
MANAFORT AS WELL. 

589
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,008
>> YES. 

590
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:50,876
IN FACT, HE HAS ALSO DONE BOTH 

591
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,843
SIDES WITHIN THE SAME 

592
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:52,143
COMMENTARY. 

593
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,445
ANY OF THESE THINGS HE IS 

594
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:58,317
CHARGED WITH WERE BEFORE THE 

595
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:58,584
CAMPAIGN. 

596
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,351
HE REALLY WAS NOT WORKING ON 

597
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,385
THE CAMPAIGN VERY LONG, I DID 

598
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,453
NOT KNOW HIM VERY WELL. 

599
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:05,190
AND THEN IN THE NEXT BREATH 

600
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,325
SAYING -- HE IS A GOOD GUY, AND 

601
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,059
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TERRIBLE. 

602
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,660
>> SO, IT IS UNCLEAR. 

603
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,160
>> TO SAY THE LEAST. 

604
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,933
>> RICKY, REAL QUICK -- 8 

605
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:15,767
GUILTY VERDICTS, ANY SENSE OF 

606
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:16,535
WHAT KIND OF SENTENCE THAT WILL 

607
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,502
BRING IF HE DOES NOT RECEIVE A 

608
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:17,969
PRESIDENTIAL PARDON? 

609
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,271
>> I CANNOT SAY THAT OFF THE 

610
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,440
TOP OF MY HEAD AND SPECULATION. 

611
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,643
BUT, WE HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST 

612
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,944
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS INTENT 

613
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,414
ON RECOMMENDING 8-10 YEARS. 

614
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:32,484
THAT MAY BE WITH THE 18. 

615
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,485
WE DO NOT KNOW IF THEY WILL 

616
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:37,189
FEEL THE SAME ABOUT 8. RICKY 

617
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:37,890
KLEEMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

618
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,957
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

619
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:39,257
BREAK NOW. 

620
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,058
MUCH MORE ON THIS NEXT ON RED 

621
00:17:40,058 --> 00:00:00,000
AND BLUE.
