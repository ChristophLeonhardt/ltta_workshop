JEFFREY LORD FROM CNN HAS
BEEN FIRED.
JEFFREY LORD IS THE TOKEN
CONSERVATIVE VOICE THAT COMES UP
AND SAYS TRUMP THINGS AND
THEN GETS YELLED AT BY
EVERYBODY.
APPARENTLY WENT TOO FAR.
HERE'S WHAT HE TWEETED.
SEIG HEIL, WHICH IS A NAZI
SALUTE OUT THE FULL STORY IS
THAT JEFFREY LORD HAD BEEN AT
WAR WITH MEDIA MATTERS SAYING
THEY HAD BEEN GOING AFTER SEAN
HANNITY AND TRYING TO GET HIS
SPONSORS TO PULL OUT THEIR
SPONSORSHIPS BECAUSE OF
HANNITY'S BEHAVIOR AND JEFFREY
LORD KIND OF CALLED THEM
OUT SAYING THEIR FASCISTS.
THE QUOTE THAT HE SAID IS MEDIA
MATTERS ARE FASCIST AND
ANTI-FREE SPEECH BIGOTS WHO MAKE
IT THEIR MISSION TO SHUT DOWN
FREE SPEECH THAT THEY DON'T LIKE.
IT IS KIND OF THE REACTION
FROM CONSERVATIVES TO CALL
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS
FASCISTS FOR SETTING IT DOWN.
JEFFREY LORD WROTE AN ARTICLE
ABOUT THAT.
ANGELO CALLED HIM OUT.
HERE'S THAT SWEET.
BEHOLD.
CNN'S RESIDENT TRUMP ADVOCATE
JEFFREY LORD AT LEAST THEY
AREN'T TRYING TO HIDE ANYTHING
ANYMORE.
THAT IS THE WRONG TWEET, BUT THE
TWEET WAS ESSENTIALLY HE SAID
THAT JEFFREY LORD HAD SPELLED
HIS NAME WRONG IN THE COLUMN
HEADING AND JEFFREY LORD SAID
THIS, SAYING HE'S A FASCIST
OUT THE NEXT WEEK.
NICE TRY.
I WILL HAPPY TO MOCK NAZIS AND
FASCISTS ANY DAY.
AND SINCE YOU LEAD MEDIA MATTERS
FASCIST I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU HATE IT.
SEEING THE NAZI SALUTE, IT SEEMS
THAT CNN HAS PARTED WAYS
WITH HIM SAYING NAZI SALUTES
ARE INDEFENSIBLE.
JEFFREY LORD IS NO LONGER WITH
THE NETWORK.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO
SAY.
FIRST OF ALL, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, WE GOT HIM.
THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE SAYING
THAT AT MEDIA MATTERS HEADQUARTERS
BUT WE DIDN'T GET HIM, HE GOT
HIMSELF.
COME ON, YOU HAVE TO KNOW CNN IS
GOING TO BE TOUCHY ABOUT
THAT.
ARE THEY THOUGH?
IS CNN GOING TO BE TOUCHY ABOUT
THAT?
CNN EMPLOYS ALL SORTS OF
CONTRIBUTORS THAT ARE
PASSIONATE CRAZY.
AND THEY DO IT ON PURPOSE
BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT HELPS
THEIR RATINGS.
PEOPLE LIKE THE TRAIN WRECK.
THEY KNOW OTHER MEDIA
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
METEORITE WILL COVER THEIR CLIPS
IF THEY HAVE INSANE PEOPLE
ON A REGULAR BASIS.
THEY SPECIFICALLY SEEK OUT
LUNATICS AND THEN ALL OF A
SUDDEN IT IS LIKE OH, HE SAID
SOMETHING REALLY OFFENSIVE
ON TWITTER.
TIME TO FIRE
HIM.
JEFFREY LORD IS A BAD PERSON.
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT,
BUT FIRING HIM IS PUTTING A
TINY LITTLE BAND-AID ON A
GUSHING WOUND AND THE
GUSHING WOUND IS CNN'S HIRING
DECISIONS.
THEY HIRE LUNATICS.
I AM NOT SAYING THAT THEY
SHOULDN'T REPRESENT OR HAVE
PEOPLE COME ON TO REPRESENT
CONSERVATIVES OF THE RIGHT
WING, BUT THEY SPECIFICALLY GO
FOR CRAZY PEOPLE LIKE SCOTT
HE NOW HUGHES WHO LITERALLY
HAS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK UP
ANYTHING SHE EVER SAYS AND THEY
LOVE IT.
THEY KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE
COVERED BY OTHER MEDIA
OUTLETS BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE
WATCHING TRAIN WRECKS.
I THINK CNN NEEDS TO REALLY
REEVALUATE THEIR OWN HIRING
BEHAVIOR BEFORE THEY TAKE THE
MORAL HIGH GROUND ON ANYTHING.
HAVE THE RIGHT SUITES HERE.
ONE OF THE TWEETS ANGELO USED TO
CALLOUT JEFFREY LORD.
THE ACTUAL TWEET WAS HI CNN/
CNN PR.
CARE TO COMMENT
ON YOUR ON-AIR TALENT
ISSUING IN A SERIOUS AND
NON-IRONIC WAY NOT NAZI
SALUTES?
THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH A HERE
IS I THINK JEFFREY LORD IS AN
IDIOT BUT HE WAS NOT BEING
SERIOUS WHEN HE USED IT,
ESPECIALLY IF HE HAS A HISTORY
OF CALLING CORAZON A FASCIST.
IT IS CONSISTENT TO SAY THAT
HE IS USING THIS TO MOCK CARUSONE
FOR SHUTTING HIM DOWN, EVEN
THOUGH I DON'T BUY IN TO THE
WHOLE ARGUMENT I THINK IT IS
STUPID WHEN PEOPLE SAY, THE LEFT
IS TRYING TO MUZZLE US BECAUSE
THEY ARE FASCISTS.
I DON'T THINK THAT CARUSONE, I
WOULD CALL THIS A FLOP.
IF IT WAS IN BASKETBALL IT WOULD
BE A FLOP.
ONE OF THOSE SOCCER PEOPLE GETS
HIT BARELY AND THEY GO ALL
MY GOD AND THEY FREAK OUT AND
DROP THEIR COINAGE.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE.
I THINK JEFFREY LORD HAS NO
BUSINESS BEING ON CNN.
IF YOU ARE GOING TO HIRE SOMEONE
TO REPRESENT WHATEVER HE IS
PURPORTEDLY REPRESENTING, HIRE
SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN.
NOT JUST A RUBBER CHARRED FART
CARCASS LIKE JEFFREY LORD.
HE SMILES THROUGH IT.
HE KNOWS HE IS TALKING BS.
HE KNOW HE IS JUST SIGNALING
WHAT HE IS SUPPOSED TO DO.
COLLECT THE CHECKING GOES HOME.
THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYING.
I GET WAS SEEN AND WANTS TO DO.
THEY ARE ABSCESSED WITH
PRETENDING LIKE BOTH SIDES ARE
EQUAL IN EVERY SITUATION AND
THEY WANT TO PRESENT ALL
PERSPECTIVES, BUT PRESENTING THE
RIGHT WING PERSPECTIVE DOES
NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE
LUNATICS ON YOUR SHOW AND
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO.
I THINK THEY DO THAT ON PURPOSE.
THEN WHAT REASONABLE
DISCUSSIONS.
FIRST OF ALL, LET ME BE
CLEAR.
JEFFREY LORD SHOULD NOT OF BEEN
FIRED, NOT FOR THIS I AGREE
COMPLETELY WITH BRETT.
HE
WASN'T SAYING IT IN A POSITIVE
WAY, HE WAS SAYING IT TO MEDIA
MATTERS ACCUSING THEM OF
BEING FASCISTS.
HE WASN'T SAYING I LIKE THE
SALUTE, HE WAS USING AS AN
INSULT AGAINST MEDIA MATTERS.
TO FIRE HIM BASED ON NO CONTEXT
I THINK IT'S WRONG.
YOU MISS THAT HE WAS CALLING
THEM FASCIST?
THERE MAKING IT SEEM LIKE HE WAS
PROUDLY FASCIST.
HE MAY BE FASCIST FOR OTHER
REASONS AND WE CAN ALL GET INTO
NAME-CALLING, BUT IN THIS CASE,
HE WAS USING IT AS AN INSULT.
THIS IS WHAT DRIVES PEOPLE CRAZY
ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA.
THEY HAVE THESE NONSENSE RULES.
I ALSO AGREE WITH ANNA, HE
SHOULD'VE NEVER BEEN HIRED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
IT'S NOT TO SAY YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TRUMP ADVOCATES FOR
GOOD LUCK TRYING TO FIND A
SANE ONE THAT DOESN'T
CONSISTENTLY DRAW FABRICATIONS.
THEY HAVE 12 OTHER CONSERVATIVES
ON AIR.
ITÃ­S NOT LIKE HE IS
ONLY ONE ON-AIR AND A LOT OF
THEM ARE TRUMP ADVOCATES
AND SOME OF THEM ARE REPUBLICANS
WERE AGAINST TRUMP.
THEY HAVE THE WHOLE RANGE SO NOW
BASICALLY THIS IS PROBABLY CNN
GOING WE CAN LET GO OF THIS ONE
BECAUSE WE HAVE 12 OTHERS
NOW BUT LOOK, THE STANDARD ISN'T
THAT HARD CONSERVATIVES.
THE STANDARD IS MONITOR WHAT YOU
GUYS ARE, WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTORS
ARE SAYING ON-AIR AND IF THEY
SAYING THINGS THAT ARE TRUE,
GIVEN OBLIGATIONS YOUR AUDIENCE
TO CLING THAT THEY ARE NOT TRUE
AND IF YOU WANT TO FIRE JEFFREY
LORD FOR CONSISTENTLY SAYING
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE ON-AIR,
GREAT, THAT MAKES SENSE OR GIVE
HIM A WARNING ABOUT THAT, TALK
TO YOUR AUDIENCE ABOUT IT HAVE A
DISCUSSION OVER IT AND MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T HIRE A LUNATIC IN THE
FIRST PLACE AND IF YOU CAN'T
FIND A SANE TRUMP ADVOCATE THAT
ALSO MIGHT TELL YOU SOMETHING
BUT FIRING HIM OVER THIS
MAKES NO SENSE.
IT IS AN ARBITRARY THING OF
YOU SAID A WORD THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T SAY EVEN THOUGH IT IS
IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
CONTEXT, DON'T CARE, THIRD RAIL,
YOU WERE FIRED.
THERE ARE WRONG ON EVERY FRONT
HERE BUT I CAN'T WAY THAT
THEY GOT ME TO DEFEND JEFFREY
LORD IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.
EXACTLY.
EVERY SO OFTEN YOU WILL GET
A HEADLINE ABOUT HOW
FRUSTRATING ANDERSON COOPER WAS
WITH A DISCUSSION ON HIS
SHOW HER HOW FRUSTRATED JOHN
DON WOMEN WAS WITH THESE
LUNATICS MAKING THE COMMENT THAT
THEY TYPICALLY MAKE ON HIS
SHOW, BUT WHERE YOU DURING THE
PRODUCTION OF YOUR OWN PROGRAM?
YOU SIGNED OFF ON IT.
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
THOSE PEOPLE ARE.
I THINK A LOT OF IT WITH A 24
HOUR NEWS CYCLE IS JUST LAZINESS
AND WHO IS AROUND?
WHO CAN WE RELY ON TO BE
THERE BECAUSE I 60
MINUTES AND HAVE TO FELLA.
THERE'S SO MUCH NEW STUFF
HE DESPICABLE PLATES AND THE
SINK IN THE KITCHEN AND
JEFFREY LORD IS HIDING UNDER
THEIR, HIS LITTLE SLUG NEST.
JEFFREY, ARE YOU IN THEIR QUEST
TO COME OUT AND SPEAK ON
DON WOMEN SHOW.
HE IS LIKE ALL RIGHT.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THEY HIRED
HIM TO BE TOXIC BECAUSE IT
ADDS TO THEIR SOAP OPERA SO
DON'T PRETEND THAT YOU ARE
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN OUR RACE
THAT HE IS TOXIC.
BUT AS YOU HIRED HIM FOR.
