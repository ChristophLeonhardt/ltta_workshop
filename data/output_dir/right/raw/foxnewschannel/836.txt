1
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:09,918
STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

2
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:11,219
WE ARE HAVING A PARTY HERE.

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,722
IMMIGRATION IS ON THE AGENDA

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,089
AGAIN.

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,992
THEY WILL SEE IF THEY CAN HUSH

6
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:19,194
OUT THE DEAL.

7
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:22,030
BIG BUSINESS JUMPED ON DATA

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,966
SHOWING THERE ARE MORE JOB

9
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:28,570
VACANCY THEN PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,639
THERE IS ONE PROBLEM, WE STILL

11
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:33,175
HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST LABOR

12
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:34,709
PARTICIPATION IN THE WESTERN

13
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:35,010
WORLD.

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,146
IF WE HAD THE U.K.'S RATE THAT

15
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,248
WOULD MEAN MILLIONS MORE

16
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,884
AMERICANS AT WORK.

17
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:47,022
INSTEAD OF LAZY IMPORTING

18
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,257
FOREIGN WORKERS WHY NOT TRAIN

19
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,059
AMERICAN WORKERS SO THEY CAN

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,795
TAKE THE JOB THE BOOMING ECONOMY

21
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,030
IS CREATING.

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,166
ALSO YOUR FAVORITE TOPIC, CAN WE

23
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,402
START WITH THE SADLY PREDICTABLE

24
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,304
RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS.

25
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:04,539
THAT MEANS WE NEED MORE

26
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:05,407
IMMIGRATION.

27
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:07,275
>> IT'S STRANGE, IT'S THE ONE

28
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,544
THING VERY RICH PEOPLE DON'T

29
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:09,945
BRAG ABOUT.

30
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,647
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE BRAG ABOUT

31
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:14,783
HOW EXPENSIVE THEIR CARS ARE AND

32
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,684
WINE IS.

33
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:19,120
THE ONE THING THEY DON'T WANT TO

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,357
BRAG ABOUT IS HUMAN LABOR.

35
00:01:22,357 --> 00:01:29,631
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT.

36
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,566
THEY JUST WANT CHEAPER AND

37
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:33,568
CHEAPER LABOR AND THERE IS NO

38
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:35,470
BETTER EXAMPLE OF YOUR SWAMP

39
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,306
THEN THE FACT THAT THE SIGNATURE

40
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,542
ISSUE THAT THIS HISTORIC

41
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:41,676
CANDIDATE RAN ON.

42
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:44,613
THE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE ARE

43
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:47,849
DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE TRYING

44
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,486
TO PUSH THROUGH AMNESTY.

45
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:58,860
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CALL THIS

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,928
AMNESTY.

47
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:03,899
STEVE: OKAY, LET'S SORT OF GO

48
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,735
OVER THE POLICY THING HERE.

49
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,670
THIS IS THE LAY

50
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,206
THIS IS THE LABOR PARTICIPATION.

51
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,341
WHEN THE ECONOMY GROWS RAPIDLY

52
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,744
THERE IS A CRUNCH AND YOU HEAR

53
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,779
WE CAN'T FIND WORKERS.

54
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:18,480
THAT'S TRUE.

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,215
WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE SITTING

56
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:21,917
ON THE SIDELINES.

57
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,753
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS FALLING

58
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:28,189
BUT LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE

59
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,190
ISN'T CHANGING.

60
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:39,334
PEOPLE WHO

61
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,680
RATES UP.

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,315
PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ABOUT

63
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,517
THEMSELVES AND THEY CONTRIBUTE.

64
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:57,452
YOU DON'T SPEND AS MUCH ON

65
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:59,454
WELFARE AND GIVE A HANDOUT ALL

66
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:02,157
OF THE TIME.

67
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:03,425
>> IMMIGRATION GOES HAND AND

68
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:04,526
GLOVE WITH THIS.

69
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:06,661
YOU HAVE THE SECRETARY OF

70
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:08,396
HOMELAND SECURITY TODAY SAYING

71
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,333
THEY ARE NOT COMING IN THE PORT

72
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,134
OF ENTRY BUT BETWEEN.

73
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:16,571
WE ALSO HAD THE DEBATE OF

74
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,941
WHETHER WE SHOULD SPEND 25

75
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:21,710
BILLION BUILDING A WALL TO HELP

76
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,345
BORDER PATROL.

77
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:25,780
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

78
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,049
I REJECT AMNESTY.

79
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,918
I DON'T FEEL THAT'S THE WAY TO

80
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,852
DO IT.

81
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:33,188
I FEEL A MORAL OBLIGATION.

82
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:35,724
THAT'S THE PERSON I WANT IN THE

83
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:36,191
COUNTRY.

84
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,926
AMERICANS ARE TRYING TO GET A

85
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,793
JOB.

86
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,462
>> WE HAVE THESE BILLS GOING ON

87
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:43,398
IN THE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT'S

88
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:44,099
WEIGHTING IN.

89
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,267
HE TWEETED ABOUT IT TONIGHT.

90
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,970
WHAT DO YOU SEE THE POTENTIAL

91
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,639
FOR ANYTHING HAPPENING HERE?

92
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,407
>> HE WILL DO A BETTER JOB OF

93
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:54,042
COMING UP WITH A FRESH IDEA.

94
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:56,244
THESE PEOPLE HAVE FAILED IN THE

95
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:56,544
PAST.

96
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,079
THEY HAVE FAILED AGAIN.

97
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,115
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET

98
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,316
ANYBODY TO WORK TOGETHER.

99
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:02,717
THEY ARE NOT SEVERING THE

100
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:04,052
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

101
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,787
WHY NOT EMPLOY THE PEOPLE HERE

102
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,189
AND MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT

103
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:08,923
THEMSELVES.

104
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:12,027
I'M ALL FOR GIVING SOMEONE A

105
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:13,662
HELPING HAND.

106
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:15,997
WHY NOT DO SOMETHING TO GET THEM

107
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:17,932
ENGAGED IN THE WORK FORCE.

108
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:20,135
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE MORE

109
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,469
JOBS THEN PEOPLE TO FILL THEM.

110
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:26,408
WE HAVE TO GET THE LAY BAR LABOR

111
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:27,242
PARTICIPATION UP.

112
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:30,679
THE ANSWER IS NOT AMNESTY.

113
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:33,181
WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO

114
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,316
STAY WHO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW TO

115
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,217
BEGIN WITH.

116
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:38,053
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE

117
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,388
WALL AND SECURE THE BORDERS AND

118
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,590
EVERYONE NEEDS TO TAKE THEIR

119
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,124
TURN.

120
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,859
I'M FLUSTERED WITH PEOPLE

121
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,761
BLAMING THE PRESIDENT AND

122
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,097
TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN BEING

123
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:49,464
SEPARATED.

124
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:51,032
DON'T BREAK THE LAW AND BLAME US

125
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:52,634
WHEN YOU HAVE TOTAL DISREGARD

126
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,669
FOR THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS.

127
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,105
WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS.

128
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:59,641
WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME IN.

129
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,242
FOLLOW THE RULES AND WAIT YOUR

130
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,043
TURN IN LINE.

131
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,279
WE ARE GOING TO EMPLOY THE

132
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,315
PEOPLE ARE HERE LAWFULLY AND THE

133
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:08,717
CITIZENS THAT SHOULD BE WORKING

134
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:11,486
AND MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT

135
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:11,953
THEMSELVES.

136
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:15,890
>> JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT,

137
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,760
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE

138
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,629
CHILD SEPARATION THING.

139
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:22,797
THE HUMANE ALTERNATIVE IS BUILD

140
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:24,566
THE WALL THEN YOU WON'T HAVE ANY

141
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:28,036
ONE COMING IN.

142
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,572
>> THE MOST QUOTED FEDERAL JUDGE

143
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:35,443
IN MY BOOK HE'S HARDLY A

144
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:35,944
CONSERVATIVE.

145
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:39,380
20 YEARS AGO HE WROTE AN OPINION

146
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,816
THAT INVOLVED ANCHOR BABIES THAT

147
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:44,652
SAY WE HAVE TO STOP THIS.

148
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,654
IT'S THE SAME THING WITH THE

149
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:46,955
WALL.

150
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,289
AS LONG AS PEOPLE CAN COME HERE

151
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:51,326
AND DROP A BABY --

152
00:05:51,326 --> 00:05:53,661
STEVE: THAT'S A TERM A LOT OF

153
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:56,264
PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT.

154
00:05:56,264 --> 00:06:00,135
>> IT'S WHATEVER WAY WE

155
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:01,136
COMMUNICATE IMMIGRATION.

156
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:03,071
DON'T LET THEM KNOW ANY FACTS.

157
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:07,208
THERE IS NOTHING RACIAL OR

158
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:07,542
SEXUAL.

159
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,444
YOU ANCHOR THE CHILD HERE AND

160
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:11,679
THEY CAN BRING IN ALL OF THE

161
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,180
RELATIVES.

162
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,281
IT'S A METAPHOR.

163
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,717
THEY ARE UPSET ABOUT IT BECAUSE

164
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:18,052
IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DISCUSSION

165
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:18,820
IMMIGRATION.

166
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,956
>> AND CHAIN MIGRATION.

167
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:25,226
>> BACK THEN POSENER SAID AS

168
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:27,529
LONG AS YOU INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE

169
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,264
COMING HERE THEY WILL KEEP DYING

170
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:33,334
AND CROSSING THROUGH THE DESERT

171
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:37,405
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THE MAGNET

172
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:37,772
ON.

173
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,608
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT.

174
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,043
I'LL SAY ONE OTHER THING.

175
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:44,445
THESE CHILD ACTORS WEEPING AND

176
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,415
CRYING ON ALL OF THE OTHER

177
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,416
NETWORKS 24/7.

178
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,954
DON'T FALL FOR IT MR.

179
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,321
PRESIDENT.

180
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,490
I GET NERVOUS WHEN HE GETS NEWS

181
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,058
FROM TV.

182
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:58,993
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

183
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:02,497
>> A NEW YORKER IS NOT A

184
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:03,097
CONSERVATIVE PUBLICATION

185
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:04,899
STEVE: I TOLD YOU WE WOULDN'T

186
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,135
GET A WORLD IN.

187
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,538
I'M SORRY WE HAVE TO GO.

188
00:07:10,538 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THEY ARE GETTING SCRIPTS TO
