thank you thank you so much I only wish the administration had allowed us to fill up the rest of these seats which we certainly would have well love you right back so first of all I just want to thank Berkeley which I have to say conservatives here have done something amazing they've just achieved something incredible if you look outside there's k-bar everywhere they've built basically these structures to keep an T from invading the premises so that means that Berkeley has actually achieved building a war wall before Donald Trump did thank you all for being here because obviously braving the idiots outside is not always easy their speech is apparently violence because my speech is violence all speech is violence so thank you for braving the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune by walking into a building congratulations to you thanks to Fred Allen thanks to young America's Foundation and the Berkeley College Republicans for their courage thanks to the police thank you to the police we've done an amazing job these are the folks who stand between civilization and lawlessness I saw the videos of business owners having to shut her up their windows today early Bank of America blocking off two ATMs because they were afraid that an tpho is going to break them the only people who are standing between those ATMs and anti feh are the police and all they get from the left is a bunch of crap that's all they get from the left but these are the heroes who stand between us and darkness so thank them so I have a few other thank-yous I want to say thank you to the morons who put up that sign across the way and says we say no it's your white supremacists bullshit well I say thank you because I also say no to white supremacists bullshit and if you stick around long enough in this speech you will hear me do exactly that the problem is I also say no to your identity politics bullshit thanks to aunt Eva and the supposed anti-fascist brigade for exposing what the radical left truly is all of America is watching because you guys are so stupid it's horrifying I am grateful and you can all go to hell you pathetic lying stupid jackasses the same goes for the mayor of the city who has suggested that an Tifa occasionally to give him free rein over the city and then and that conservatives should go home because we wouldn't want to provoke violence I do want to actually thank the administration for making the effort to put on this event tonight there were a lot of obstacles and I'll talk about the obstacles in a little bit but they did attempt to make the effort and they did unshackle the police to actually protect this so thank you to the administration for doing that I saw a lot of headlines on the way here about how is going to cost $600,000 in security for this event and that is not - to me I mean I'm not the one out threatening to break windows it's not due to you you're here listening it's due to the ante feh hard left morons who are out there breaking windows and I do want to say one thing which is that in a city as left as Berkeley if you're gonna blame me for the $600,000 in spending on security your alkene ziens think of all the jobs I just created now this lecture is titled say no to campus thuggery that's the title of the lecture because of an Tifa and the wave of violence that has engulfed this campus since earlier this year I spoke here last year some of you may remember I was here last year guys spoken like February 2016 hear nothing right I mean it was a packed house I had two security guards that was it no violence no nothing and now we are spending well into six figures so that I can say many of the same things it's utterly absurd it's utterly absurd but things have changed well why have they changed it's because there's a pathetic new movement arising all over the country from Sacramento to Berkeley to Dallas to Charlottesville and that movement says that speech is violence and must be treated as such this is groups like refuse fashions the world gets the all right later this is groups like refuse fascism which professes to promote protests but has actually said it won't rule out working with groups like Ann Tifa here is the poster that they put out earlier about me I don't know who designs their posters but guys this is too many words just bad logo and bad imagery just poorly done they say on this that the problem is not campus thuggery for those you can see this is no Ben Shapiro the problem is not campus thuggery the problem is fascist intellectual thuggery in the service of the Trump pense fascist regime well to believe this you have to have your head so far up your ass you can actually see your colon firsthand let's define a few terms first of all fascist intellectual thuggery let start with fascism what exactly is fascism well this is the term that gets thrown around a lot by people who have never read a book okay fascism is the phenomenon whereby people believe that they have the capacity to RAM their beliefs down your throat at the point of a gun or say the point of a baton or by throwing Molotov cocktails that's what fascism truly as fascism is even more of a tactic than it is an ideology it's sort of vague in terms of ideology you've had people on the Left who are fascist you know people like Stalin and then you've had people who are on the European right like Hitler who was fascist who's actually closer to the traditional American weapon II would be to the traditional American right but I've been spending my entire career standing up against fascism and the idea of an overreaching government that uses the power of the gun in order to compel people to do what they want and Tifa is fascist I am NOT a fascist and as far as the service to the Trump pense fascist regime first of all I just want to know something for all the talk about Trump and Pence being fascists I look at the protests outside wears orange Hitler shutting it down right he's nowhere to be found this idea that we're living in a fascist country we're actually living under a relatively ineffectual regime relatively ineffectual administration of anything but the idea that we're living in some sort of fascist dystopia is absurd as far as the idea that you know I'm a white supremacist in service to Trump pence couple problems they are one as far as the service of Trump ends again I didn't vote for Trump or Hillary in vote for either of them actually so this idea that I am somehow a servant of Trump is absurd and requires you to be functionally illiterate as far as the idea I'm a white supremacist you see the thing on the top of my head right that's funny hat it's called a yarmulke hey white supremacist aren't that fond of it which is why I was according to the anti-defamation league the number one recipient of white supremacist anti-semitism on the internet among journalists in 2016 but no I'm a white supremacist now because this is a way to left work that's right if you don't agree with them everyone's white supremacists you're a Nazi Nazi should be punched and therefore it's totally fine to stand outside and try to shut down events if you can get away with it they're not getting away with it tonight because the police have been allowed to actually do their jobs so what is their specific objection to me well according to this masterfully done poster and says Shapiro is coming to campus to spread ugly fascist views dressed up in slick talking intellectual garb I do like the slick talking it says this is harmful exclamation point he along with fascists of many stripes have targeted Berkeley because reversing Berkeley's radical history would be a major advance for the consolidation of fascism on campuses everywhere and throughout society the reason I'm here having asked this a lot the reason that I am here is because fascism does not own this university because there are students who do want to hear differing views who don't want to be told that they can only hear one view who don't believe that the First Amendment should die under the jackboots and Birkenstocks of a bunch of anarchist communist pieces of garbage but I don't just want to talk about the people who actually get violent because I think that in the civil society this is one thing we should all agree on and I've been pleased to see that even people like Nancy Pelosi have condemned antiva Nancy Pelosi with whom I disagree on literally every issue it is possible to disagree on including the the proper use of Botox but she and I agree on this right we we well agree that violence should be out of bounds and if you're on the left and you don't agree with that let me suggest you that you don't belong living in a civilized society because civilized society is based on the premise that the government has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force as Max Weber put it and the idea that you're supposed to violate that if you don't like what I'm saying makes you an uncivilized barbarian okay but it's not just that I want to talk about okay I want to talk about an ideology that goes a little bit deeper than that an sefa couldn't go anywhere without an ideology that runs broader than an Tifa without a group of people willing to look the other way well what is the view that undergirds Antipa what's the what's the view that undergirds the hard left many of whom celebrate an see for we're doing so until it became politically unpalatable to do so it's a view that America is a terrible horrible no good very bad place right now the truth is that America is an incredible place it's the greatest place in the history of the world it is the freest most prosperous country most tolerant country in the history of planet Earth this country is an incredible place full of opportunity nobody by and large cares enough about you to stop you from achieving your dreams that includes you people who are shouting out there in the audience okay no one cares about you get over yourselves I don't care about you no one cares about you no one's trying to stop you because you're irrelevant to me I have a wife and two children I care about them I don't care about you you don't mean anything to me well except for that guy who said he loves me I love that guy too but everybody else okay that means in a free country if you fail it is probably your own fault if it is somebody else's fault if somebody is actually trying to throw up obstacles in front of you in a way that is unjust and bigoted point out the specific instance so we can all side with you we all want to be on the same side we all want to help out when somebody is a racist and trying to stop you we all want to sound and stop that to the idea however that America as a whole owns your failure when you can't point to specific problems does not wash it is use shifting the buck it's a waste of time and energy blaming your failures on the system unless you've got some evidence but unfortunately on college campuses and for the left more broadly there has been this notion that America is bad and the reason that you fail is because America has historically been very bad right this is the identity politics of the left because America is bad in that it targets you America targets you and we have an entire hierarchy of intersectionality that's been built by the left to tell you whether your views are legitimate or not I mean the more victimized you are the more legitimate your views are so the hierarchy goes something like this the people whose views are most valuable and who have been most victimized the very top are people who are LGBTQ and then you get black people and then you get women and then you get Hispanic people and then you get Native Americans and then you get Asians and then you get you choose may be above Asians may be Jews then Asians in the very very bottom you get straight white males right those are the people who have nothing to say about anything because obviously they are the beneficiaries of this white privilege system now the logic of intersectionality because it suggests that the value of your opinion lies in your ethnic identity and your group identity the idea is that if I attack your ideas if I say that you have bad ideas what I am really doing is attacking you personally I'm really attacking your identity I'm aggressing you you might require counseling right this is the philosophy of microaggressions my words are violence even the term microaggressions suggests that it is an aggression against you right microaggressions I am aggressing you it's an act of violence as NYU social psychologist Jonathan Hite has said microaggressions are small actions or word choices that seem on their face to have no malicious intent but that are thought of as a kind of violence nonetheless the thing is you don't actually have to intend to offend anyone to micro aggress them they just have to feel offended and the thing is that microaggressions are actual violence this is why you see the adults outside shouting that speech is violence because they think that I'm actually doing them violence when they don't hear me right when they but if they won't hear me then presumably I'd be doing them violence and they would need counselling and if they act with violence it's because it's in response and unfortunately this university engages in precisely this of damaging attitudes at the same time they are willing to allow the police to finance Aoife they are fostering an attitude that says that certain types of speech are violence which is the gas in the tank for groups like an Tifa it's the gas in the tank for the hard left before my arrival the university obviously put in place all sorts of security measures to stop people from getting violent which is great but they also put out a letter and they put out a letter to all the students here and here's what it said it said that I was a threat because they were going to offer quote support and counseling services for students staff and faculty we are deeply concerned about the impact some speakers may have on individual sense of safety and belonging no one should be made to feel threatened or harassed simply because of who they are or what they believe for that reason the following support services are being offered and encouraged and they offer employees support services and student support services you see I'm attacking your identity if we disagree about politics and you may require counseling by the way just side note if you require counseling because of the speech let me suggest to you that was a mistake for you to have foregone psychiatric treatment long ago I know I'm super scary I look at me I'm physically intimidating as everyone knows right I mean I mean no I understand you're afraid of an attorney to the hall can ruin your life okay but the truth is I think that you're big boys and big girls and you can probably handle it I assume you're not a bunch of weaklings and pansies and snowflakes that may not be a fair assumption but I will assume it for the sake of this argument I assume you can handle disagreement if in fact you cannot handle disagreement you are making your life harder and you're making your life force and you are making the country worse you're driving political polarization by failing to engage on a level of discussion as you know we're gonna do a Q&A after this and I love taking questions my favorite thing and I have a rule which is if you disagree with me you raise your hand you go to the front of the line because discussion makes the country better by you feeling insulted and then whining about it and then suggesting that you're a victim without evidence and that I have victimized you because I won't accept your victimhood this makes the country a worse place so I want to go briefly through a couple of the intersectional hierarchy groups people who feel they're victims in American society and explain why you are not in fact a victim I need to take control of your own life and become an adult so let's start with the idea that poor people in America are victimized and this is sort of the Bernie Sanders case income inequality as the root of all evil there's an tifa's case that communism or anarchism would be a better solution than say a free and civil society that's raised half the world out of abject poverty an income inequality is not the big problem nobody rich is making you poor Bill Gates did not make you poor Bill Gates provided you a product and if you bought it that is your fault hey the upper-middle class grew from 12% of Americans in 1979 to 30% as of 2014 that is a massive growth in the upper-middle class the rich are not making you poorer they are paying your salary American income mobility by the way is just as strong as European countries with far more redistribution income mobility drops only when you drop out of high school you have a baby out of wedlock okay this is what makes you poor okay how about the idea that if you're black in America there's a white supremacist hierarchy that is keeping you down now listen you'd be a fool not to acknowledge or a liar not to acknowledge the history of racism in America everybody acknowledges that if you have half a brain of course slavery Jim Crow awful evil treatment at the hands of awful evil people we all acknowledge this we all acknowledge the collective sin of the United States in promulgating this and the individual sins more importantly of the people who actually promulgated this stuff okay we all get that but that's not what we're talking about now we're talking about now because I wasn't born when Jim Crow was in place I wasn't an adult when Jim Crow was in place I know that I'm not a racist and I know I haven't acted in a racist manner and I would bet you money that the people in this room haven't acted in a racist manner that they haven't held slaves or voted for Jim Crow I will bet you money that is the case you cannot fix past injustice is with current sin justices the only way to fix packs passed in justices is with individual freedom that's it okay the idea that black people in the United States are disproportionately poor because America is Ray that's just not true at least not in terms of American America's racism today keeping black people down it's just not the case if that were the case then you'd have to look at group income and decide based on group income who's been victimized the most and who the country was built for well by that standard the country was built by Asians okay because the racial group with the highest median income in the United States is Asians the Constitution was not written by a bunch of people who speak Korean because the Constitution is a document of freedom not a document of ethnicity so here are the three rules you wanna you want to be rich in America you want to do well in America you want to put aside the whining about the system again you point out to me an individual instance of racism I will stand next to you and fight it but if you want to whine about America no good okay here are the three rules that you need to fulfill as a person before you can start complaining about your life failure as being the result of somebody else's actions number one you need to finish high school number two you need to get married before you have babies number three you need to get a job that's it you do those things you will not be permanently poor in the United States of America according to the Brookings Institute two percent of Americans who follow these rules are in poverty seventy five percent have joined the middle class well what about racism 71 percent of poor families with children are unmarried the poverty rate among non married white families was 22 percent in 2008 that same year the poverty rate among black married couples was less than seven percent but what happened to racism why weren't those black married couples poorer than the single white moms because enough to do with color it has to do with life decisions and we can talk about differentials in crime and where these statistics come from I mean the basic rule is that if you don't commit crime you're not going to be arrested for it the police are not going around arresting black people for the fun of it they're going around arresting criminals based on criminal reports which is why the number of criminal reports based on race matches up exactly with a number of criminal arrests based on race okay if you don't report people for crime it's hard for the police to know to pick them up okay how about women this idea that women are vastly victimized in our society Hillary Clinton is making bucco dollars off of this nonsense this week I tweeted earlier this week this week we found out that a clown can emerge from the woods and scared half of Americans and also it came out but Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton is going around whining about how she there's a glass ceiling and she couldn't break through it and it's all because of sexism it's not because she was the world's worst candidate and pretty appalling human being no it was because everybody is a sexist everybody's a sexist and we here in this context very much about the wage gap right the idea that women are paid significantly less than men seventy two cents on the dollar okay that's absolute sheer nonsense it is absolute nonsense in 147 out of 150 of the biggest cities in America women make eight percent more money than men do in their peer group that wage gap is growing not shrinking at colleges fifty five percent of women in college are women that gap is getting larger 58% of all graduate degrees go to women okay the majority of voters are women if we are living in a place where women are vastly victimized by men I'd really like to see that place and as far as this idea that there's a vast rape epidemic going on on campus every rape as I have said a thousand times every rape should be dealt with by the prosecution of the rapist ending with their jailing castration or death okay that's how I feel about rape but this nonsense statistic that's been presented at one in five women on college campuses being raped it's just not true it's just not true the actual statistic according to the Department of Justice is something like one in every 58 obviously far too high but not one in five if we're one in five by the way if you're a woman at this campus you should go to your parents and ask them what kind of nuts they are to send you in a war zone where you're likely to be raped okay how about the idea that gays and lesbians are really living under the boot of American society well in terms of income they certainly aren't ok certainly not in terms of income women and lesbian couples make far more money than women in straight couples do men and gay couples make slightly less than men and straight couples but same-sex couples with both partners in the labor force make eight thousand dollars more per year than straight couples and they are typically higher educated okay so that talks about the identity politics this intersectional hierarchy of the left but there's another group that engages in identity politics that I want to talk about now and it's the battle between the identity politics of the left and the identity politics of the so-called alright that is really making the country a significantly worse place and it needs to stop now because it is utter and complete horrible bullshit the first thing to know this notion that the alt-right is actually conservative as nonsense let me define what I mean by alright because not everybody who likes peppy memes or Harambee memes is a member of the alright okay not everybody that the left says is all right is actually all right I mean the left calls me all right which is patently insane I mean you legitimately have to have a screw loose to call me all right I spend half my career attacking me all right okay what is the alt right so the alt right are a group of people who believe that ideology and ethnicity are inextricably intertwined just like the identity politics left right on the identity politics left if you're a black person who is a leftist you're a leftist because you're a black person on the identity politics right Western civilization was not built by people with good ideas it was built by people with white skin and that means that people who don't have white skin cannot properly assimilate into Western civilization this has no grounding in reality the fact is that there are lots of white people in Britain before the Romans arrived and they weren't living a civilized life as we would currently call it under Western civilization okay in fact the people who the Romans write when when Italians were coming to the United States in the early part of the 20th century there was tremendous discrimination against Italians because they weren't considered properly white the definition of white moves around a lot based on convenience right sometimes Jews are white sometimes Jews are not white it sort of depends on what you're talking about but according to the alright because ideology and race are inextricably intertwined they must have a white identity politics all their own if there's a group of people who are fighting for the group identity politics of blacks or of women or of gays and lesbians then there has to be a white group that fights back on behalf of the white race as you may have noticed I think all of this is disgusting okay Western civilization is not built on race there have been lots of countries all over Europe that were not particularly civilized and we're quite white and freedom personal responsibility separation of powers god-given rights protected by a government elected with the consent of the government these are the values of Western civilization but the alt-right actually overtly rejects these ideas they say the Constitution is outmoded that it doesn't work they say the government for white people is necessary and good because you can't assimilate people to so-called the white culture they hang out with neo-nazis because a lot of them actually believe some of the same things that they need Nazis believe white supremacy now let's be great about this is like 10,000 people across the country this is not a million people it's not ten million people this is not 63 million people it's not 200 million deplorable it's a very small select group of absolutely terrible people who believe absolutely terrible things but they're getting a lot of attention in coverage right now because we live in a reactionary moment a lot of the people are reacting to the identity politics have left by making nice with the alright there's this weird notion on the right that if you drink left his tears that's enough right drinking leftist here's enough so if the alt-right takes off the left they're fine okay that's it's disgusting it's disgusting I have no other word for it okay you actually have to stand it is not enough to stand against bad ideologies you must also stand for a good ideology you must stand for a good philosophy okay you cannot stand with bad people just because you think those bad people make your enemies cry the enemy of your enemy in a country where we're all supposed to be friends is not only bad strategy it destroys the country wholesale so how do we solve all this right we're on campus and we're hearing the identity politics of the left and then you watch the news and you see the identity politics of the all right how do you solve all of this well the way that you solve all of this first of all let's start with the campus thuggery the way you solve all that is by letting the police do their jobs okay administrators need to let the police do their jobs none of this would have gone anywhere if back in February when Milo quite significantly disliked when Milo came to speak if they had not if they had allowed the police to do their jobs and arrest everyone who even hinted at violence ok people who get violence should be arrested and they should spend time in jail and the authorities have a responsibility to allow the police to do their jobs and this is not the fault of the cops this is the fault of cowardly political actors who pusillanimous cowards who hide behind their desks every time some people on the Left whine a little bit ok the second thing that has to happen is you have to stop seeing everybody in America as an enemy who despises you based on identity again they don't care about you you're not that important a human okay not that many of us know each other not that many of us care about each other we care about our families we care about our friends and we certainly don't want to stop each other we mostly want to be treated civilly and we can all do that we stop looking into each other's eyes and seeing a potential enemy instead of seeing somebody who's just a person a person who probably doesn't care about you very much and doesn't want to stop you and doesn't mind what you do is it that difficult stuff and finally stop seeing yourself as a victim because in order to see everybody else is an enemy which justifies your violence and hate against them you have to see yourself as their victim again America is the greatest country in human history you are not a victim if you are a victim of something you need to show me what you are a victim of and I will stand beside you but do not blame the freest most civil society in the history of planet Earth for your failures because that's on you now was that so rough I mean do we need $600,000 of security to hear all of that I have a feeling the vast majority of people who are protesting the speech who've never heard of me I'm not arrogant enough to believe that an Tifa sits around watching thug life videos if they did I doubt they would be members van Tifa but the idea that they're out there protesting they're out there maybe getting violent currently four people have been arrested for carrying weapons already the idea that all that is happening is indicative of the fact that we have stopped seeing each other as individuals we are all individuals I'm an individual with a particular point of view I am NOT a cardboard cutout for you to call the white supremacist I am NOT a cardboard cutout for you to call a Nazi and neither is anybody else in this room get to know people get to know their views discuss debate that's what America that is what America is all about if we all do that I do think that America can see a better day because I think we're in a dark moment right now but I think we can get to a brighter moment if we stop seeing each other as members of groups and identifying as members of groups primarily and instead see each other as individuals made in God's image one with equal value to another in God's eyes if we do that America will see a resurgence thank you so much all right now the fun part so we're gonna do Q&A and I believe there's a microphone down here on the left as always my rule is that if you raise your hand because you disagree you get to go to the front of the line we are indeed gonna do a Q&A this is by far the most fun point I would think correct guys yeah okay so ladies and gentlemen Berkeley red tape and fire code there's gonna require everyone who wants to ask a question to walk out and around and form a line over there on the outside of the lobby right there we're gonna have a nosh or ushering people in after you ask your question there's a green arrow following this way you're gonna stand right here on this X and you're gonna walk to the back even if you're sitting in the front you're gonna have to walk all the way back and into the other doors over there thank you ladies and gentlemen and we'll wait for the first one thank you guys for having me oh hello hey I was gone hi thank you for coming I do not disagree with a lot that you just said that's why I'm here yeah so let's talk about institutions because you're saying should not blame the institutions I have an example and please tell me why you think you know that person per se is not victimized so let's start with the beginning of a life you're a baby you were born into a really poor family in a really poor community where the school is not good where crimes are high you as a baby I think you know it's you know you're quite helpless there and I would according to my thinking I would say that's quite in an unequal and that is you know I feel like that person because if you think about education that should be a public good in my opinion should be provided equally in all communities instead of just based on you know how rich your house is just could you respond to that so I mean so if I'm getting a question strakes it's a little there's a bit of an echo here so you're suggesting that children grow up in unequal circumstances because of the school district they go to not all schools are equal there are a lot of public schools that are garbage and so kids don't have an equal access to to success yes and I feel like in my world and my political thinking I think that is inequality and that is institutions yes fill people so it's so I agree with you that not all public schools are good and I agree with you that there is such a thing as inequality of course there's such a thing as inequality we're not all born in the same place for a novel born equally intelligent we're not all born with equal gifts some of us are born smart but short will never play in the NBA you know like we're not all born like this is just a truism the question is is there inequity right is there an equity that needs to be remedied and the question then is what's the best way to remedy that inequity so when you say that there's inequality is that because they're a bunch of rich people who are screwing those poor kids out of a good school I don't think so because we're spending rules of money in the public schools particularly in poor areas and it's not paying off very well what I would suggest that the best possible solution is to devolve those dollars back to parents who presumably care about those kids more than the public school system does and allow them to choose the schools for their children so I can agree with you that there's inequality then the question becomes okay how do we solve that problem so I'm not again inequality and inequity are not the same thing and equated the two I think is a mistake you can go follow up it's fine thank you so I feel like you know if we were getting really scholarly and academic here that is exactly what we saw is saying essentially talking about natural equality and contrived inequality naturally inequality would be in the quality that you're saying inequity would be the contrived point and I feel like now in our society there in institutions is contributing to the ultimate contrived inequality in the sense that public you children just do not have access to the you know the same level of education if we're gonna construct utopia and then suggest all children are going to have the same level of education and that's just not reality okay there's no place on earth that has that because that's just not the case so you're right that there's a difference between difference in smarts and difference in the poverty situation in which you grew up but the truth is that the biggest inequality is the biggest inequity and inequality I would say is parents who decide to get pregnant out of wedlock I mean if you want to look at academic underperformance it has much less to do with the school that you go to and much more to do with your family situation at home again I'm not arguing with you that any of these things are a problem the question is quote/unquote who's to blame and I think this is where we get into a problem in politics because the idea is that the person to blame must be the rich guy down the street I don't think it's the rich guys fault I think that there are certain things in life that just aren't fair and then the question becomes okay how do we maximize opportunity without invading the rights of somebody else and I think the easiest way to do that is to let people keep more of their own money and to do more to privatize the school system and give people more choice thank you as great they like reveal them from behind a curtain and they walk forth it's like a game show hey Ben I'm honored to be the second participant in this game show you made the argument that the gender Cape to the gender pay gap is a myth yes and one of the main reasons that this is the case is because that female stem education is at a lower level than it is for men females are continued discouraged to not go into STEM fields really it's like much lower than men are so I was wondering what you feel about this argument and like you know how you do you like think it should be remedied or like nothing well I mean I think it's free country can choose what profession to go into if the idea is that the pay gap is largely due to profession choice that's obviously true if you look at a lot of dangerous professions firemen people who work on oil rigs it tends to be men because men want to go into those professions it's also true that men tend to spend more hours in the workplace it's also true that women takes it to tend to take more time off with babies that's not a bad thing by the way it's not a rip on women it's always will drink to me when feminists are like it's terrible that women take time off to be with their babies why it's a wonderful thing yeah I mean completely agree I think there is a societal discouragement for women to go into these particular fields I was wondering if like you that there's societal disparagement of women going into being a firefighter what I actually see is that there's an affirmative action program in many of these cases for women going into things like firefighting because there's now an affirmative attempt to get well you bring those STEM fields like science technology so okay so the stem okay so James d'amore has an interesting memo that got him fired from Google on this but it is but it is certainly true that when you look at for example what women majoring in college the number of women who major in stem studies which has nothing to do with getting a job in paying its women majoring in humanities much more than men do men are just interested in this stuff when it's not a terrible thing I don't see why there better be like there's societal influence that occurs even before the college level right I mean I don't know that there are a lot of people saying to a seventh-grader girl who's good at math you need to stop it and go read some poetry okay I mean I am I have three younger sisters right I have my wife is a doctor by the way so talking about stem my wife's a doctor my mom runs it come my mom runs companies so I'm very much for women in the workplace and being able for them to choose what they want to choose I really don't see a lot if you tell me the person who's out there going women in science Phi Phi then I'll stand with you and say yeah that person's adult that's really stupid you know if a woman wants to go into science and she's qualified for the job the same way that I didn't equally qualified guy is great what I don't want is lowering of standards in science to meet any particular person and I also don't want this idea that because a woman chooses not to go into science and a lot of women choose not to go into science and that creates a disproportionate percentage based on an individual choice that suddenly this is some sort of group discrimination happening in front of us I first off I just want to say thank you for speaking as a fellow Jewish conservative thank you so much for the two of us man so I wanted to ask you do you believe that there's an explanation for why victimization has become the main tactic of a far left to gain support of the people yes so I think first of all I do you think victimization was always a tactic of the far left it was just economic victimization right Marxism is based on the idea that the proletariat are gonna rise up and overthrow the booze Hwa but there's this vast group of under underprivileged people as they call it who are going to rise up and they're going to break the chains that bind them and take over the world whose always based on this notion that you're being victimized by somebody else but in the 1960s particularly it was clear that as America was thriving so so much in the 1950s economically in America becoming this great world power the prominent world power in terms of the economy it was very hard to make the case to two people who are not as wealthy that you need to rise up against the country that's creating all your wealth and so instead what the Left decided to do was misdirect into a legitimate grievance which was in ethnic based and sex based grievance which made a lot more sense in the 1950s and 60s than it does in 2017 and so there's this idea that if we identify you as groups we can use those groups to tear down the American infrastructure this system that's been built by white men for the privilege of white men and we can't air that we couldn't tear that down based on class these it turns out a lot of poor people in the United States still wanted to get rich and they need that system to get rich but you can do it based on group identity because if you can make women feel that the system is designed to keep them down if you make black people feel like the system is designed to keep them down and then you can tell them that it's the capitalist system more generally that is designed to keep them down and that whole system the whole superstructure is rife with racism it has to be torn out root and branch if you can do that then you can actually build a movement on the back of that and that's what you're seeing in the Democratic Party actually right now it's fascinating to watch the conflicts between sort of the Obama identity politics Democratic Party and the Bernie Sanders socialist Democratic Party because that's actually a no-bail right I mean it's the battle between economic class distinction based victimization and identity politics based victimization which is really more what Obama used in 2012 to win reelection so would you say this is more of like get-rich-quick scheme or if I can't be rich no one can well I think that it's it depends on which people you're talking about the people who buy into the idea of victimization I don't need to get rich quick scheme so much as an I feel victimized scheme and I don't feel like taking responsibility but for the people at the top I think that it actually is a a get-rich-quick scheme I think the people at the top very often know exactly what they are doing and know because they don't they don't live like this right I mean Barack Obama didn't live his life thinking of himself as a dramatic victim of society until he decided to rent rooms for my father and revise everything right but the fact is that Barack Obama is a guy who really achieved his whole life I mean he was an achiever and if he had been sitting around thinking how victimized he was his whole life and very difficult to get for him to get where you got thank you thanks hey then given that the single biggest predictor of interchange intergenerational poverty is whether an individual was raised in a single or a two-parent household which would be for or against an affirmative action policy where the institution gives preferential treatment to applicants who were raised in a single-parent household or do you believe that that kind of policy would give rise to more problems of its own right so here's my view on affirmative action I don't believe that you should lower standards in order to let people in because your disadvantaging somebody else and you shouldn't do it by color so let me put it this way if you have a white applicant who scored 1400 on their SATs well sorry I understand they changed the system now a 2100 on their SATs and they want to go to a and they want to go to a good school and you have and that person grew up in a single family a single-parent family impoverished and you have a black person it was Colin Powell's kid who scores exactly the same score then I think that if you're going to look at all the factors you can say okay the person who had to overcome all these obstacles to get the same score deserves to get it but that's based on overcoming obstacles that's a character judgment that that is not a judgment on the basis of race and I'd also don't think that it's a hard and fast rule with regard to single motherhood again if you are the single child if you're the kid who is the the child of some famous Hollywood actress and grew up in the lap of luxury versus you grew up in Appalachia or the inner city with two parents I think you have to look at totality of the circumstances in other words okay what's the smartest person alive on the Left I left okay sorry this hardest person yeah those are two very different questions the smartest person on the left well points to the Lena Dunham shouting guy hmm let's see I do think that I mean in terms of pure intelligence I think that there are a lot of scientists who are on the left you know like I wouldn't want to get into a scientific debate with Stephen Hawking or Richard Dawkins and they're in a different field of specialty so he's taking pure IQ or in terms of being good politics in terms of like your political rival for you in terms of I mean I think there are people who I'd be interested to talk to about policy you know I think that when I was at Harvard Law School there was a they're a bunch of professors who are on the left including Elizabeth Warren actually who she was relatively interesting to talk to although got less say over time but but there was a guy named Richard Parker who's a professor there if I really liked Lani Guinier who was a professor there who actually ended up writing me a law firm recommendation she was such a leftist that she was I believe nominated for Under Secretary of Labor on her Bill Clinton and a Democratic Senate rejected her too she was so far left she was a she was a smart lady again I don't think that all the leftists are stupid or anything I think that they start from wrong foundational principles and if you're smart person starting from the wrong principles you can reason your way into virtually anything first of all I just wanted to thank you for coming as someone who is left-leaning I truly believe in freedom of speech and I think that that is a principle of it well thank you for coming so my question was about abortion and I just wanted to know why exactly do you think a first trimester fetus has moral value okay so a first trimester fetus has moral value because whether you considered a potential human life or or a full-on human life it has more value than just a cluster of cells if left to its natural processes it will grow into a baby so the real question is where do you draw the line so you can draw the line at the heartbeat because it's very hard to draw the line at the heartbeat there are people who are adults who are alive because of a pacemaker they need some sort of outside force generating their heartbeat okay you're gonna do it based on brain function okay well what about people who are in a coma should we just kill them right the problem is anytime you draw any line other than the inception of the child you end up drawing a false line that can also be applied to people who are adults so either human life has intrinsic value or it doesn't I think we both agree that adults human light has intrinsic value can we start from that premise I believe that it's sentience has is what gives something moral value not necessarily not necessarily being a human alone okay when you're - when you're asleep can I stab you I'm still considered sentient when I'm asleep okay if you are in a coma from which you may awake can I stab you well then no so that's still potential sentence and it's still a potential you know this potential sentience being a fetus the issue I have with that though is that in me if I'm in a coma and I'm not like doing anything to anyone I'm not causing any issues amongst the world whereas an unwanted child may or may not be a burden to people lots of people's parents who are unwanted right we're bunch of college students you know that the problem is that now it's an error shifting the argument right before you were making the argument based on the intrinsic value of a life based on sentience and now you're talking about the level of burden that somebody presents as a separate moral arguments okay I don't believe that you being a burden on somebody is justification for them killing you as a general rule I'll leave it at that but I appreciate you and thank you thanks hello mr. Shapiro you have consistently praised the free market as the most effective means by which to combat racism sexism etc yes right you believe legislation prohibiting such behaviors is essentially unneeded in today's day and age because you have faith that people such as yourself are conscious enough to fight discrimination in business or it can be shown and at the end of the day a business should be given immense freedom to conduct itself in the pursuit of profit my question is as follows if insurance companies can charge young males as a group higher prices for car insurance than young females because the former has statistically been shown to be more reckless drivers does this not leave open the possibility in a free market system for insurance companies to charge premiums based on certain ethnic or racial categories if these ethnic or racial categories statistically correlate with more reckless driving if you object to the notion of charging someone more based on a factor that that person has virtually no agency in choosing such as race or sex why do you not condemn the fact that young men have to pay more if you do not object to the possibility that person of a certain sex ethnic or racial group may have to pay more on that basis then are you not failing to disavow discriminatory business practice okay so that's a long paragraph but I think what it really boils down to the answer is that what you're taught you are now conflating ethnic racism with risk factors okay I don't conflate racism with ripped at risk factors meaning if you are saying that that insurance companies may use being black as a proxy for heart disease for example because black men suffer from heart disease at a higher rate than white men do of the same age once you hit a certain age then my answer is that insurance company is in the business of assessing risk not in the business of assessing racism so if they look at you and they say that this is a higher risk factor I mean another case sickle-cell anemia right there are certain diseases that actually do a flick traces differently tay-sachs affects Jews differently so the answer is you're an insurance company of course are gonna charge more to somebody who has a higher risk factor that's not racism that's just the profit motive I'm not saying that everyone's gonna get charged the same in an Insurance Scheme of course not I assume that you and I won't be charged the same I'm older than you presumably they'll measure our bodily health I don't know how much pot you smoke like they'll make a bunch of distinctions you know and they'll make a bunch of decisions as to what our risk factors are and how that measures out in terms of what I need to pay in order to cover my projections but that has nothing to do with with quote-unquote discrimination that's just a basic market design variation so there was a study in which organization but Native Americans in Arizona were found to have you know to essentially be engaged in fatal car crashes at a higher rate than any other group okay you think it's perfectly permissible for insurance companies to charge someone a surplus I mean just chart someone an extra premium by virtue of the fact that they are Native American in Arizona no I think it's a fair for an insurance company to charge someone based on the risk factor of driving so what I would suggest is that in a free market system this why I defend a free market system let's say there was an insurance company - what you're talking about right and the insurance company decided Native Americans get charged more okay there would be another insurance company that would come along and they would say okay is it really true the Native Americans universally are being charged more or can I undercut my competitor by looking at people on an individual level and looking at all of their risk factors apart from race because race is not inherently linked by drunk driving with males because for instance not all males you know are going to be in and other themselves like more reckless drivers than females however like as you said neither is that the case but this is why I mean let's be real about this is my car insurance companies have good driver discounts for example they've good student discounts right they actually do look at more than you just like my insurance rates went up through the ceiling I got caught going down the i-5 at 1:13 and had my license suspended for a month they've gone down since because I haven't had a ticket for five years so you know this is so the point that I'm making is that if you are suggesting that if you're trying to lineup discrimination with market based profit if your question is is that can you imagine a situation in which a business makes more money by discriminating and would that be okay then the answer would be it's a free it's a business you can do what you want in a free society and I have no right to use your services however it has yet to come to my attention that racial discrimination in a business is an actual profitable thing over time in a free market system where people can compete because race is not inherently connected to behavioral categories right the basis of racism is that race is connected to behavior well I just like to say for instance Tomas sole point pointed out like in his book black rednecks white liberals or whatever yes that is right yeah yeah you're right okay right yeah I got that data point you got it ah keep when not that the Irish for instance were in the Americas for hundreds of hundreds of years locked in destitute grinding poverty right okay so you just said that race you know if you're a company and you Institute racist policies won't like like there's no long term gain to be made from those policies and I think that that's erroneous to say because as you know inequities inequalities disparities do exist between certain communities so you'd have to show that the disparity based on race and why it's biologically inborn as opposed to culture I'm going to say that it's not biologically born I'm just saying that if you had a policy okay I don't want you to compare here's the problem I'm having and I think we can stop at this cuz but I don't want to confound race with behavior unless you can show me that race is the inerrant source of the behavior and if it is the inerrant source of behavior then we can have a separate discussion but I don't see that and if you show me that race is in fact that then that's that's a separate discussion as to whether we have to force businesses not to take race into account is that fair I've been has gone further north in California predominately conservative writing and my question is are you familiar with the Jefferson State movement and if so what do you think about it I'm sorry I missed it because the echo are you familiar with the Jefferson State movement and if so what do you think about it I'm sorry this is such an effort yes yes thank you so yes I am familiar with it I think that California is far too large and encompasses far too many different people of different of different political orientations for it to have this many electoral votes that said I think that the chances of separating California into from political point of view the chance of separating California into three or four states with you know six or eight senators that could be a very dangerous thing for the balance of the country okay thank you they've been Bert this is a two-parter PSA and question so PSA is that even though there was a bunch of standby tickets and there was a line out the door the administration revoked all the standby tickets for all those people and I think that that should be openly shunned that's totally bad yeah I did hear that and that's a great dress I mean obviously look at this I mean we've got empty seats here and the only reason we have it we had a we had more than three thousand people signed up for this event the administration cut off the upper balcony because they were apparently afraid that Antipa was going to somehow rip out the bolted down seats and fling them onto the people below I'm not joking like this was the actual excuse that they gave and then we thought okay there were gonna be a bunch of people who signed up on the left to get tickets and didn't show up specifically so there would be empty seats and as you say hundreds of people showed up outside and we're not allowed in because the administration sees the tickets if it's for safety reasons it's cowardice okay you know I'll try to assume the best that it's for safety reasons but if it's cowardice obviously it's cowardice and should be openly condemned all right so for my question more towards drug use and the criminalization of drug use I know that you don't particularly condone drug use but how do you feel about the criminal justice system you know with all these nonviolent offenders all the money that we spend on all the nonviolent offenders and drug use openly I mean so maybe drug use is bad but should we still criminalize it and treat those people the way that we do and so lose money like that I am actually libertarian on drugs so that means that so let me be clear about this people who smoke dope annoy the living crap out of me and they smell terrible that said if you want to smoke dope and lose brain cells then that's your problem so long as you're not coming to me for a handout I think that there are certain drugs like for example PCP that apparently makes you violent and that has externalities that's something that you have to talk about policing you'd have to talk about policing in terms of you know selling drugs to minors but it doesn't seem to me that when you're talking about things like marijuana for example you couldn't police marijuana in the same way that you police cigarettes or alcohol and just make it very difficult to sell to people who are underage the biggest problem that you have right now is that marijuana is so plentiful in places like California that even legalizing it is not gonna get rid of the black market because it actually that the price is higher in the legal market than it would be on the black market so that's that's a serious problem and suggest that deregulation is actually possibly a worthwhile thing there are some I do I'll admit that I'm split on some substances like obviously when you look at the opioid epidemic and you see the addictive level of that marijuana is slightly different because the evidence for addictiveness inand marijuana's mixed at best but when you talk about opioids which are actually addictive the higher level regulation of opioids seems to me not inappropriate so to clarify my question do you think that we should still be criminalizing these nonviolent offenders in regards to I mean any drug again it depends on the it depends on the offense so if you're selling dope to a minor yes you should that should be criminal if you are if you are smoking to open your room then no I don't think that that should be criminal alright thank you hello mr. Shapiro so I'd like to first pull up on my question before making it so mr. Shapiro as a conservative intellectual I respect you deeply and I agree with you on a host of issues however there is one where I disagree with you which is what we should do about climate change while I agree with you that we should be skeptical of climate alarmists I cannot help but think of Pascal's wager if the skeptics are right we have nothing to lose but if they are wrong then we have a world to lose in a 1984 election advertisement Ronald Reagan campaign said if there's a baron if you think there's a bear in the woods you bring your gun given this Maxim and Reagan's decision to protect the ozone layer by limiting CFCs via the Montreal Protocol at a time when the science was very much split on whether or not the ozone layer could ever be repaired would you support a revenue neutral carbon tax that would be revenue neutral in the sense that the tax would be balanced by tax by lowering of taxes on like businesses and on individuals and things like that do you think that this would be a good insurance policy that would not necessarily give the command economies of the command economists of the left what they want but also entertain the possibility that maybe climate change Israel and maybe we should do something about it okay so here's my position on climate change i am i would say lukewarm on climate change in the sense that I think that the global that the greenhouse gas effect has been proven in laboratories that carbon emissions can make the world warmer the question is the sensitivity of the climate to those greenhouse gas emissions and how much is absorbed by the oceans for example and what effect that has on the climate long term because the computer modeling has been so flawed thus far that said there even if you believed that client let's say that we take the IPCC estimate right the IPCC estimate is that we're supposed to increase I think by the end of the century by seven degrees Fahrenheit is the is the global estimate so that varies obviously place to place that also means that you have to take into account cost right so I'm you know as far as a carbon tax I haven't actually looked at the economics of what you're talking about specifically enough but general regulations they've been posed on carbon taxes talk about penalizing companies in such a way that the cost is passed on to the consumer it seems to me that if you're gonna create new taxes without dramatically lowering taxes as you suggest which is really what the left proposes the left's order proposes carbon taxes but no offsets then you're going to end up with the situation where the cost of Energy's passed on to the consumer which leaves more people in poverty and I think that pretending that there are no trade-offs when it comes to government regulation is is foolhardy I also think that the the truth is that what we've seen is that greenhouse gas emissions are declining thanks to technological development and for example the easiest way to to lower greenhouse gas emissions right now would be a build a bunch of nuclear power plants which is something that the left in California has opposed for a very very long time we have another nuclear power plant here for like 40 years there's if you look at the rise of Tesla you know the idea that there's not new technologies around the corner that are going to help us mitigate the the emissions is is foolhardy to me I think that when when Reagan says you know bring gun into the woods if you see a bear the question isn't whether you bring a gun into the woods the question is whether or if you suspected that a bear is there the question isn't whether to bring a gun into the woods right now based on the economists that I've looked at the question is whether you should randomly wander around the woods in a tank right is that worthwhile because the kind of the kind of solutions that it seems the left is suggesting are necessary in order to actually curb what they think is coming are so dramatic that you would talk about in really dramatically lowering the American and the global standard of living in order to combat an ill that may or may not happen and even if it does happen may be easier to deal with a hundred years from now or technology a hundred years from now is gonna be a lot better and the idea by the way that people don't move populations is not true of a population movement has been a consistent thing throughout human history right but what I'm what I'm specifically advocating for here is that the right to come up with its own policy in in service of solving climate change right now the discussion has been dominated by the type of people that you're talking about who want to bring tanks into the forests randomly why I'm suggesting this carbon sorry this carbon tax that is revenue neutral that should be supported by conservatives is because it is a better solution to a lot of what we're seeing on the left and I think that conservative intellectuals like yourself who have a lot of sway and who have media companies could advertise this policies I'd be happy to let if you're asking if I look at your proposal the answer is yes if you send me your proposal I'll be happy to look at it and but I think that it's worth noting that there are actually three positions right one is that the free market and new efficiencies and new technologies will help curb this on its own and that government regulation may not be the answer then there's the hard left position which is we should take over everything and then there's the position that you're advocating so I'll have to look at your position and see where I think it stacks up in the investigative things but environmental regulations I don't know many conservatives who are not in favor of some at least minimal environmental regulations because those are externalities that affect people beyond the beyond you obviously all right thank you mr. shanks hi my name is Caroline well thank you for coming yeah whenever somebody on the Left comes when my lectures it's like an AAA meeting Thank You Caroline for coming since you believe abortion is the same as murder do you believe women who get abortions even when their lives or the child's life isn't in danger should be up she should be put on trial for murder yes or no I think that I think abortionists should be put on trial I mean I don't think the women should be put on trial for a couple of different reasons so the first reason is because I don't think that it is effective in deterring abortion to put women on trial for for the killing of the unborn the second reason is because I think that we in our society have unfortunately gotten to such a point that an entire generation have been indoctrinated to believe particularly an entire generation of women since that's what we're talking about here I've been indoctrinated to believe that a baby is a polyp and so when they remove it I'm not sure there's the actual mens rea unnecessary the actual criminal intent necessary for a prosecution so when we're talking about you know the typical pro-life position here has been that the woman is a victim and abortion nearly as much as the baby is that there is that there's an entire abortion industry that is geared toward teaching women that babies are not babies and that getting and that getting a baby aborted is in fact a betterment of their life so no I'm not in favor of prosecuting women for abortions but I mean you know I mean there of women who do have the content right like if someone if a woman goes to an abortion clinic they are ordering the murder of their child in your opinion like what you would say well I just gave you I gave you two reasons one a public policy one and and one like you'd have to show me you really have to show me the case of a woman who went in there and said I know this is a baby cut its brains out I like if that's happening then that is infanticide I mean that's like it wouldn't you acknowledge I mean if a woman walked in with a baby that was one day old and said here's my baby kill it wouldn't you put her on trial but that's that's not what we're talking about in the vast majority of abortions the truth is unfortunately that women don't actually believe they are killing a child they actually believe they're killing something that is non-human and is the same thing as removing a tumor or something so are you saying that you don't no I'm not saying that at all I'm saying that women who I'm saying the vast majority of women who obtain abortions don't think that abortion is murder and intense is is a is it is a fundamental element in any criminal prosecution I feel I feel horrible for women who have abortions I think that it's terrible for them I think it's I think a lot worse for the baby obviously and you make law and public policy based on the vast majority not on the outlying case no I absolutely can because there are many types of murder right um there's there's manslaughter yeah there's unintentional murder so the doctor knows that time saying the doctor has the mens rea ax the doctor has the actual intent to commit a murder because the doctor full well knows that that is a baby in there who's beating hard he or she is stopping so was that so you would put them on trial for indirect manslaughter so I would put Kermit Gosnell on trial for first-degree murder you know I would put out put abortionist on trial for for either second-degree murder or manslaughter I mean this is this is a crime against humanity that's occurring and if you believe that obviously to be ideologically consistent you have to say that and this has been again the traditional pro-life position I'm not aware of any major pro-life or in America who believes that women should be put on trial for abortion okay hey Ben my name's Andrew and since doc has been making a huge headlines throughout the whole nation what do you think should we do now should have been repelled should have been should should they have made it something else better or should we continue having daca I'm sorry what was the daca Kodaka okay so okay so first of all my position on immigration is I'm actually very libertarian on immigration except for two factors one is government payments that go to legal immigrants and the second is the is the cultural assimilation issue for people who come across the border illegally and aren't willing to assimilate into traditional American culture right so these are two serious concerns I'm not as concerned with the economics of illegal immigration in the sense that people who say we have to restrict our labor force in order to maintain a certain wage base I don't think that's correct because this is why you see companies that actually offshore an outsource because they're looking for cheaper labor it's it's always the wildering me when conservatives say well we have to maintain a wage base by restricting the labor supply then why aren't you for raising the minimum wage that does exactly the same thing it restricts the labor supply and raises the wage base so as far as daca goes my view on daca is that people who are here illegally whether they were born here or whether they were brought here as small children or not should be assessed on a one by one judgment so I am NOT in favor of the blanket swath amnesty for millions of people based on how long they've been here I'm in favor of looking at people one-on-one and saying okay this person's in college and looks like they're gonna have a career and hasn't been taking welfare dollars this person looks like they're they're a good American or they want to be a good American put them in the back of the line on a pathway to legalization but if you're here you've taken welfare dollars you're not going to school you're not bettering yourself you're not going to be a productive part of American society you haven't imbibed basic American cultural hallmarks you do that you should go have the exact same standard for people who are currently here illegally as the people who want to enter legally I have the same exact standard except if you're here illegally you go to the back of the line you wait behind the people who came here legally thanks thanks for special fans my friend Cory hi Ben howdy I want my question it's a little bit hard to articulate for me so please just bear for like a minute I want to ask you about the recent politically polarizing tendencies of the media and a way out so I identify two problems in particular it seems the American news media has evolved to I guess promote sensationalism and intolerance toward other political views I feel that this leads to a dangerous tendency for people to just choose their own media outlets in order to confirm their own biases I hope you agree that this convert that this occurs with respect to all political affiliations Thanks the other problem deals with bacon news obviously a term that's become like super nebulous that's throwing a great it's thrown around a great deal but specifically with fake news there are a lot of news websites have like do of dubious quality and we hear stories how other countries or companies have used Facebook advertisements for example to promote opinion to promote certain websites the and sway easily impression opinions so it's clear that Americans need I guess everybody me everybody needs a basic ease a basic access of reliable information we need to have a reliable news media that informs the public but it seems by default Americans will seek out information that they find palatable but this leads to me to believe that it should be the burden of the news media to be reliable and not I guess of it rollick so like in the past we've had something I think was called the Fairness Doctrine that was repealed like a few decades ago they required new cried out was to present yes certain views but obviously government regulation towards media information that's a slippery slope what's the way out what do you think though I mean I think the way out is more informed population unfortunately I think that the idea that the government the government should never be regulating speech or access to it once the government does that then you're wandering into very dicey quasi fistic territory when it comes to consumers of media look the media are just gonna provide you what you want to read ok the media gonna provide you what you want to click on and yes most of the I would say I think most of the people in the media yes even including the left-leaning media do want to tell the truth I think a lot of them don't recognize their own biases you know look I'm conservative that means the way that I cover the news is going to be from a conservative angle I try to separate myself enough to say okay here's the facts and then here's my opinion but everything that I say is coming from that point of view I think one of the big problems in media is people don't do that right like George Stephanopoulos tries to pretend he's an objective news source all right that doesn't mean everything he says is false but it does mean that everything he says is coming from the former campaign spokesperson for Bill Clinton and that should have an impact so if that means stuff to us to look at a variety of news sources I recommend this all the time right don't just listen to my podcast go listen to pod saves America pod save America don't just read daily wire to go over and check out Huffington Post make sure that you're reading a variety of news sources if you actually want to tell what the facts are the best way to do it is to read to opposing to opposing websites or to opposing outlets and think of them as lines that intersect at one point and the point at which they intersect is the factual point and whatever those two stories have in common you can take that is probably the grain of truth in the story okay so I guess I understand I understand your emphasis on self-reliance but evidently to the extent that you believe that that one believes in the efficiency of free markets evidently people tend to cook people you know move to to confirm their own biases and that's not occurring well I'm you know I think that's why you know the founders relied on the idea that we were gonna have a civically educated public I mean in the end you're gonna have to trust the people one way or another I don't trust the government to regulate what the people see I trust the government less to regulate the people to regulate what the people see then I do the people to educate themselves and this one falls under the heading of as Winston Churchill said democracy is the worst system except for all the others right unfortunately there's no way out of this box people are going to have to inform themselves better and yes of course people have in a tendency toward confirmation bias but that's why it's your job if you know about confirmation bias to suggest to people that maybe they should stop relying so much on their own confirmation bias okay thanks Ben Thanks hey Ben my name is Rehan and I'm a Muslim and junior in high school and I've been really trying to have her in and what I believe in so I've been listening to conservatives recently and you've been one of the main educators so thank you for coming here well thank you so now I think you go a bit far when you talk about inequality being one of the stupidest things to measure because it's well dr. Dan Pearson talks about the Gini coefficient so they calculate income inequality in neighborhoods and streets and it shows that it's an increase in crime when you see your neighbor you know earning more than you so do you have any response to that yes there's greater income inequality between Bill Gates in his neighbor than there is between anybody living in the inner city and there's no crime in Bill Gates his neighborhood so I would suggest that it has more to do with poverty in the neighborhood than it has to do with income inequality in the neighborhood okay one more question you talked about institution racism in our it doesn't really exist and I don't think you've digged up enough if have you heard of bank lending discrimination and it's been well yes okay so bank lending discrimination and the idea of redlining was widely debunked in the early 2000s with regard to how banks operate the idea that banks sit around and then they figure out okay there's a black guy and he has exactly the same credit score as a white guy I'm not gonna give him alone bank's base it on credit scores if they didn't they would go out of business so the the you know a lot of this has been wildly exaggerated again if you can show me a bank that actually is redlining then they will be prosecuted under federal law that's a violation of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 he can't discriminate even in private businesses on the basis of race yeah JPMorgan Chase had a settlement for fifty five million dollars for discriminating against Hispanics and blacks who had the same score as white people right okay so then they got punished under the law and that's a good outcome okay again that would be that'd be a case where I say that says that's a great example singular case where somebody gets punished they should be punished you know and by the way even if they weren't punished let's say they weren't punished let's say you took my total libertarian theory business your fuchsias should be able to do what they want then what you would suggest is that these people should have walked across the street to another bank that wasn't redlining them and then they should have gotten a better loan well wouldn't you say if JPMorgan Chase isn't and well as an institution they did something bad and I think capitalism makes them go bankrupt again I think discriminating against clients is a very easy way for you to go bankrupt thank you so much Shalom I'm a huge fan of yours by the way I love your work you mentioned that inalienable rights are given to us by God but I've noticed that there is an argument to the contrary posited by political philosopher Hillel Steiner it consists of the following three things the will theory the interests theory and hopefully and deontic logic the will theory states that rights govern our choices and come from our choices but if we have the inability to make a choice or the incompetence to make a choice then our rights can effectively be voided the interest theory is the opposite it says that we can't void our rights but they can be affected by the breach of a duty by another party so somebody else can take away our rights under the interest theory under hopefully and deontic logic there are four types of rights privileges claims powers and immunities all of those cancel each other out and can be taken away at any time do you have any expertise on this and can you offer an argument to the contrary okay well I can't say I wouldn't want to be unfair to the author that you're citing since I have never read that author so and I'm sure that you're doing a really great you know back-of-the-envelope job summarizing the argument but with that said it's hard for me to to take on an argument that I would want to actually read more about before I before I take it on is this in is this an argument based on so here's my basic question the reason that I say that rights are based on god-given rights is the idea that is is long held in the Western can and a combination of judeo-christian values and Aristotelian philosophy that suggests that individuals have certain rights as a facet of their reason and that reason is is originally provided by an unmoved mover all right so the idea here the reason that that is important as opposed to an atheistic philosophy of right is it's very difficult for me to see why in a theistic philosophy of right I don't know if this is an atheistic philosophy is it it has no religious components okay so so if you do without reference to if you do without reference to the inherent value of a human being then certain certain people just fall by the wayside I mean even even in the theory that you're espousing to me which again I'm only getting sort of bare-bones a bit you you even in that when you say you know for example well if you don't have the capacity to exercise will your rights go away okay well there a lot of people like children who don't really have the capacity to exercise fully their will do they have any rights at all I assume they have the right not to be killed I have assumed that they have the right not to be abused to my knowledge they don't America is one of the few developed countries with no children's rights that's not true children obviously have rights which is why you have child protective services that comes in and takes kids out of their parents home if they're being abused kids don't have the rights to control you know where they where they go to school they don't have the right to control a lot of a lot of things about their life but they certainly have basic human rights I mean that I think the entire society is built around the idea of how do we assure basic human rights to children okay that essentially answers my question thank you so much Thanks yeah I didn't quite follow everything so I'm kind of trying to get up to speed with what's happening but I wanted to thank my son he's a senior in high school he's a chairman of the yaf he's sitting right over there he is brilliant he's the one that kind of turned me on to the podcast I really enjoyed listening to sound speech taking out some of the vulgarity but um we're at a college no yeah so nobody would understand me if I didn't drop a bullshit once in a while so okay so so my main question was going to be the role of the church and in the founding of our nation our nation being so great you being Jewish I'm a Christian good about follow Jesus I was able to get to the front of line because I told him I was liberal because I'm a follower of Jesus and he was one of the most liberal human beings God in the flesh human man that ever walked the face of the earth he helped people all of that good stuff so one other thing to caveat into this how you reconcile the role of the church and in influencing culture sure I am also the fact that I did briefly grew up in California it's known to be a more liberal state of our nation I lived in Tampa Florida for three and a half years work for Hillsborough County and I used the whites-only bathroom while I was there in 1995 it wasn't being used as such but I don't know if it was the coloreds or the whites but I asked the bailiff I needed to use the restroom I wasn't familiar with the courthouse he said well we usually use the one there's no sign on it going there 1956 years or 40s looked across the hall there was a men's restroom I said hmm this is interesting I grew up in California I'm living in the south so I walked across a hallway 19 fixture 1950s fixtures so I think kind of balancing out the fact that there has been in justices in our country yes you can't go back and change up but you can tell those people that are living of a victimized mentality that look yes I can sit I understand because I used I don't know which is whites or colors and whatever but um my wife grew up in Cuba and I really enjoyed it but so here's it's okay okay so a couple a couple of things as far as the role of the of the church in American society your first question my basic philosophy on this is that the government exists to preserve certain basic rights and then you have social institutions that need to provide the safety net for the rest of society so I'm very much for a strong Church in regards to communal life I mean I belong to a synagogue I believe that if you fall on hard times then that means that the first thing that you need to do is go to your family and then the second thing you need to do is go to your church and then you go to your local community and then up the scale the problem that I see in society right now is that people go to the top of the scale the federal government they don't bother with anybody lower down on the scale which is why you see this consistent growth in the federal government judeo-christian values as I have said a thousand times are the root of the of the civilization and cannot be ripped away without collapsing the civilization on top of it as far as the the idea of you know the the existence of past racism in the United States of course I agree that's true I mean I said that right in the speech you know obviously I agree that slavery and Jim Crow were some of the worst evils perpetrated by human beings I mean they're truly truly evil the question now is we have people who are living now who have not committed those sins do we somehow remove do we punish them for the sins of their fathers in other words and is the best thing to do to teach an entire generation of young black people for example that America is inalterable racist inalterable bigoted and they're living in a country with such a brutal history of racism that they cannot rise because that actually is false backwards and hurts them that's that that's my main philosophy so you can understand what when people say listen I mean as a Jew Jews have had a long history of oppression also but that doesn't mean that I think that anybody owes me anything and I don't think that it's appropriate to teach children that somebody owes you something as a general rule who have not done anything to you I think that if somebody's done something to you then they do owe you but if they haven't done anything to you then they don't owe you anything and if you build a system based on you having to rectify mistakes that were made by your grandfather we're never got beyond us we're never gonna get beyond this because we all sinned against each other's grandfathers it's a pleasure to talk to you I disagree with you on a lot of things but well thank you for coming anyway yeah of course I think the one thing that I agree with you on is a free speech should be protected but my question is has to do with like political economy I know you're a firm believer in that the government sucks Oh like at everything pretty much you're also a firm believer that you know market-based competition is good so I was wondering what do you think about the role of like bureaucratic institutions or regulatory bodies to protect competition for example like the FCC sort of trust-busting antitrust laws so I'm not a big believer in antitrust laws because I think the vast majority of things that the government declares monopolies are not in fact monopolies the definition of monopoly is ownership of a hundred percent of market share which allows you to arbitrarily set prices and also to presumably buy out all of your competitors or use regulatory capture in order to prevent them from entering the market I think the cases that are generally brought on antitrust grounds are very very weak because there are usually large competitors even within the same industry so to take an example they broke up Microsoft Microsoft did not control 100% of the market I don't even believe it controlled 75 percent of the market control something like 50 percent of the market unless I'm getting this wrong and they broke it up anyway Apple overtook it in stock you know and probably would have without breaking up Microsoft so the idea that yeah the idea that antitrust law is a is a valuable tool there may be cases in which there are actual natural monopolies but even in those cases you'd have to prove that there is actually an attempt to screw the customer that price gouging is going on because sometimes you actually have a natural monopoly in a particular market and the pricing is going just fine like nobody was complaining about Microsoft's pricing when they were as opposing monopoly okay thank you Thanks what's up in Shapiro my name is Kyle Chapman also known as bass Nick man how you doing brother okay here you just want to let you know the proud boys are here we got your back tonight man well right here we got your back brother listen I appreciate everybody having my back and I'm very glad that the police were the ones were the only ones who had to do it because that's their job absolutely absolutely well gonna leave it at that look I just want to ask you a question you talked a lot about racism there seems to be a lot of racism directed at White's these days there seems to be just a constant relent relentless diatribe about how whites should feel guilty for who they are about the the the dangers or the that how terrible whiteness is and how we need to disavow our whiteness what's your opinion on this and on the war on Western civilization and what do you think that what do you think their intent is what do you where do you think they're going with this so as I said actually in the speech I think that using identity politics as a way of posing groups in opposition to one another is terrible and I think that you do see that I referenced this in the 2012 election cycle I think that when for example Joe Biden said that Mitt Romney wants to put y'all back in Chains to to black folks I think when he said that that was quite awful and the the sort of extension of that to the idea that there's a white privilege society seeking to keep black people down or the cops are systemically racist and you can't show evidence the cops are systemically racist or they must be that white society was built on this grand lie that they have to keep other people down yeah of course that's racism of course that's racism and there's a foolish notion going around on the left but the only people can be racist in America are white people that's obviously untrue everyone is capable of being racist all that means that you're labeling another group with particular behavior of properties based on their race so of course that's true and I think that the big the big mistake we have to be careful not to make is to is to start identifying as our quote-unquote group identity just because other people's one want to box us in we're individuals right if somebody says to you you're white and you're and you are crushing my soul and you're ruining my life because you're white my proper response probably shouldn't be not making your life better because I'm white right my proper response should be I'm making your life better because I'm an individual who's not making your life wars and so I want to be careful of the identity politics on all sides but yes of course there's racism against White's there's racism against blacks there's racism against lots of people in society what I care about is the individual instances that we can fight what you do see right against people of all races not always proportionately right look at the FBI statistics but I also want to fight in the laws that are racist so for example I think affirmative action is a racist law right because it is actually judging people based on race thank you brother my birthday and I'm honored to be here and I can't thank you for coming so I have a comment and a legitimate question the comment being you know while there's a lot of things I disagree with you're saying but I definitely agree with your opinions on how culture is ruining the black community and why blacks don't graduate from high school due to culture I think there's an element that you might be missing and I'm not sure if you brought it before so you know when the late 60s early 70s or late 70s early 80s you know when CIA introduced crack into the black community which started a snowball effect of you know blacks being overly criminalized for drug possessions black fathers leaving the home and not sticking around which led into you know in the 80s of black children being grown you know being brought up without fathers with mothers not being able to like give them proper discipline and while I do agree today that black communities suffer well for not having followed in the house fathers in the household but equally due to the culture around them like I suffered for myself you know if a black person wants to be educated in you know the hood we get called you know House Negroes and you know Uncle Tom's you know if I want to better myself and but I was you know the element of originally introducing crack into those communities which eliminated father's from the home I think those still have effects today and while I agree that there isn't systemic racism keeping black people down now I think the triggers that happened then still affect us today okay so obviously past effects present no question the question is who committed the injustice and who should be punished for it as far as the CIA introducing crack of the black community I'm gonna plead ignorance on this one because I have no idea whether that's true okay but it's it but I will say that when it comes to the single motherhood in the black community that did not start in the 1980s with crack that started in in the mid 60s with the increase in welfare the increase in the welfare state dramatically increased the level of single motherhood in the black community it was 20% around 1960 today it's in excess of 70% and that's and again I don't think that the the crack epidemic can actually explain all of that because the crack up and then it really lasted from like the early 80s to basically the early 90s and you've seen it continue the single mothers continued to grow actually in the black community sort of stabilized now but it's it continued to grow for a long while after that also I think it's worthwhile noting when we say things like you know somebody introduced crack into the black community whoever quote-unquote introduced crack into the black community and again I have no information to substantiate your theory but it is individuals who take crack right unless you are forcibly being injected with crack then you have to make the choice to to take the crack in the first place and it's also worth noting that there are a lot of black legislators in the inner city who are looking for harsher sentences on crack cocaine specifically because it was in epidemic in the inner city and was ruining a lot of lives so the only way I think that when it comes to the single greatest intergenerational poverty statistic the only way to walk this back is not through reparations I think it's through a it really is from culture it's three encoding the idea that fathers need to stick around and you're a bastard if you don't stick around outside they're a child so my question and that's true for white black or great doesn't matter to me if you're I'm a data to you demanding your kids you are just the worst kind of piece of garbage absolutely so my question you know I started getting involved in so to speak right leaning issues after Milo came to Berkeley I got assaulted by an NC femme member he tried to set me on fire with the litt Flair he called me a Nazi just today I got called it was like a Nazi I gotta tell no no just today I got called a Nazi a fascist and I consider myself a left-leaning liberal centrist now what that said Magga crew has shown me so much love in these past eight months and everyone at everyone I've met has been reasonable opened up their homes to me we've had wonderful discourse so Mike my question now is as a person who like I said considered myself a liberal and I interact with people you know on the right & Magor crew I still have people in my own personal community that you know say that oh you're talking to whites appear supporting white supremacy you know you're talking to Nazis you're supporting them what would you say to a person like me who is open to discourse and people of all sides how would you combat or at least how would you approach people who come with me with hate and saying like no no you're a bad person because you're hanging out with these people so I have a basic rule on this and it's the same again regardless of color because I've said this to people of every color if somebody calls you a racist or a bigot based on no evidence this makes them a bad person and you have every right to say so they need to actually cite evidence for why you're a racist or a bigot or a bad person before they can call you that it needs to actually be justified and you have every rationale to walk away from that conversation thinking that person is the worst person if they can't explain to you what you've done wrong and why what you've done is so terrible thank you so much thank you so much so Ben III myself at a question I'm a member of the BRIC college Republicans and I myself you know this semester we're starting a new conservative newspaper at UC Berkeley it's called the Berkeley Patriot and we're fighting really hard for everything we stand for and for the principles that we've you know known to grow and love and everything like that my question kind of surrounds what's been going on politically I think UC Berkeley is kind of a microcosm for the rest of the country in a lot of ways you spoke here I mean you just said this in your speech but you spoke here in 2016 and there were no protests nothing at all and Menino it's it's crazy to me that now we have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get you in a room and and talk to us again and and I kind of think it relates to the Overton Window I'm not sure if you know about that but it basically the range of potential discourse in society that that's considered acceptable so the furthest right thing you could probably say like you know ten years ago is probably I don't believe in gay marriage that's no longer a thing you can't say that anymore and still be accepted in society so the Overton Window is consistently just shifting leftward and when I talk about this with my left leaning friends they say that's an inevitable trend you know there's this inevitable trend towards liberalism is just it's something you cannot control it's the way society is headed and my question is do you think it's an inevitable trend and if not how can we combated as conservative students you know braving this you know horrendous climate with both you know our peers calling us fascists and Nazis and the administration just being extremely terrible as well so I listen I don't think it's an inevitable trend I think that things move in cycles and I think that there's two ways that the country can break out of it one is that things can just continue to slide downward to the point where people get wise after a long time or we can have events like this one that I think are actually really useful in showing the Liberals that that they are not the left okay I do make a distinction you notice I always use the language laughs to describe the left not liberals there's a reason liberals are people who believe in open discourse and believe in discussion even if they disagree with me on the role of government in the economy for example leftists are people who believe that I need to be shut down because my speech is insulting their identity and is a form of violence if the Liberals in the country can stand up to the left and say to them enough is enough then I think that there's hope for a discourse and I do believe in the innate rationality of the American people and the capacity that they have for coming to the correct conclusions I do think there's a possibility I mean that's why I'm in the business I'm in it's why I spend my life trying to change people's minds I think there are people who are willing to listen to facts and arguments if I didn't think that then I'd just go be a lawyer so the fact is that I don't think any of this is inevitable I think that's that's a little bit of self congratulatory claptrap from your liberal from oh well you know of course society is shifting towards us well I mean if that's the case then why did Republicans just take the house the Senate all the state houses all the governorships in the president say like come on but when you talk about the Overton Window I don't mean it exists just in terms of politics left versus right I think it also exists in terms of the nature of the discourse itself and there I think that we have moved in a really negative direction I think we've moved away from discussion and toward clubbing each other and I think that that it has to be stopped in its tracks and that's why I thank everybody here for coming and being part of a free speech event that let's be let's be frank it was cordial it was nice I really enjoyed hanging out with all of you and I think that we need more of this because if we don't have more of this instead we're gonna get more of what you were almost gonna see outside if it hadn't been for the force of the police officers we have time for one more question wait a way to make me the bad guy I apologize to everyone in line so some of you may know I got attacked with a bike lock back in you know a while back and III wondering what you think about this like should I ask him the man himself who hit me to a peaceful just brotherly Olive Branch non-violent ref their wrestling match so so let me just wanna make sure I get the story straight so you were hit by somebody yeah and now and now you're asking if you should wrestle them well that's not like on a mat with a ref no hitting you know wrestling is not about violence it's about it's about you know the person to give up when I'm hurting I'm not not exchanging blows I mean listen if he's stupid enough to agree to it more power to you and I come from a place where if somebody hits me in the face I call the cops but I mean I guess that's an alternative solution if you choose to do it he doesn't have to this is right now as I say if you make him an offer and he takes you up on it I man I mean that's that's his move okay well you know the court case hasn't happened yet we'll see like I mean after the court case this doesn't have to do with the law so I'm just wondering what you think about that I'm a libertarian if you decide to do all the ten paces okay I like that thinking okay and uh Lauren if you're still here can I get your digits please check me out on youtube / Embry Bros alright okay well thank you so much I really appreciate thank you all for coming and being part of this
