so having just watched the inequality townhall put on by Bernie Sanders like I said with Elizabeth Warren Michael Moore and Derek Hamilton I I noticed a couple things that I think are important one they gave a lot of stats I love the stats and I think they're jarring I think they're important to share a couple times they mentioned the three richest men in the country have more than more money than 50% of the country more than half the country just three guys and Michael Moore point this out throughout the night which I think was helpful that it's not just the Republicans who are doing the corruption and they are but it's a lot of Democratic Party as well and by the way those three guys well Bill Gates and Warren Buffett more likely to be Democrats Bezos a little bit more likely to be Republican but they're not what is perceived as wild crazy right-wingers of the Trump ilk but it doesn't matter the bottom line is if you allow for private financing of Elections you will have the people who financed elections served the period so I love that Elizabeth Warren near the end said let's call it what it is corruption that's what it is okay and so that is how the system got raged so top 10% of earners have 75% of the wealth in the country the bottom 50% only have 1% of the wealth is that amazing 1% of the wealth for 15% top ten have 75 a lot of people yes and so then Elizabeth Warren mentioned this chart without showing it so I wanted to show it let's go to graphic 102 here she talked about how American productivity has been fantastic and if you watch The Young Turks you've seen me put this chart up a lot I think I said this years and years ago I think this is the most instructive chart there is and and now it's great to see people in power beginning to refer to it productivity who has been fantastic for the American worker throughout including now but our early conversations started flatlining wages flatline since that chart has it at 73 is the the divergence begins but a good reason to believe the 78 and 80 were the big difference and Elizabeth Warren mentioned that as well and so a couple of interesting things related to that number one that is 76 to 78 were two infamous Supreme Court decisions before Citizens United and that was Buckley v Valeo and belani where Supreme Court said corporations can give money to politicians and we were toast okay I'm gonna show you the effect it had on taxes in a second but Elizabeth Warren mentioned something really interesting I did not know about the effect it had on the wage gap and the wealth gap between african-americans and and white Americans so it turns out between 1965 and 9 1980 we actually started closing the gap and it's shrunk by 30% so african-americans were starting to catch up to white Americans which is great news white Americans were not suffering they were also going up everybody's all the votes were being lifted right and then Supreme Court makes those decisions and since then the gap has continued to expand so and and in fact Derek Hamilton pointed out that African American families make about I have about 10% a wealth of white families it's another set of numbers that I always show you guys graphics 104 105 here average two should say median two-parent black family net wealth $16,000 and median two-parent white family in America 160 $1,300 I'm shocked by that second number as well yeah I would have figured it was lower so Elizabeth Warren mentioned in Boston it's even way worse something to the tune of two hundred forty seven thousand dollars for the average white family which is great I'm surprised that's a nice number right great wonderful average black family she said in Boston eight dollars in wealth so what they emphasize throughout the night is equality of opportunity that's also great to hear because it's also something that we've been talking about on the Yonkers forever some people asked me to define a progressive I say two things one is the expansion of Liberty and so - not just property in white men but - all white men in there African Americans into women and they get gay rights etcetera but the second part is equality of opportunity and so that is what the right-wing mischaracterizes nobody's looking for a handout nobody's looking for equality of results but things like single-payer Healthcare gives you a chance because you're not gonna die you're not gonna get bankrupted by up your healthcare bills college for all gives your kids a chance so that's what we're looking for and that's what we had in things like the GI Bill in the past and the laws that we passed and one more thing they all emphasize them rightfully so that this is not how it has to be that we make choices and unfortunately the Supreme Court allowing money in politics allowed the upper class to direct those choices okay and to capture those choices but as a country together we can get back to making those choices and say it doesn't have to be this way they have free collagen in Germany as they talked about in the in the town hall but they have free health care universal health care in every developed country but ours and the list goes on and on we need to make a choice to end them on and I love that in a town hall about inequality they said the number one culprit is money in politics that is absolutely right that's why we've been laser focused on it on The Young Turks that's what you need you need an amendment to get it out so that we can fix issues like this and go back to making choices in a democracy yeah Wow raise a lot of points there okay i'ma try to remember the thing is they're saying it so I agree amazing statistics the one that Michael Moore wanted focus on the end was we have this idea of what a homeless person is why they're in that state and they pointed out that the just about half of the homeless people you come across are working they might be working a full-time job even but unable to actually afford their rents I thought that was a great statistic amongst a lot of great ones Michael Moore also cited somebody like 60% of the country if someone across the country in their family died they couldn't actually go and visit him which is another way of saying one of the points that we repeat quite often is that a four or $500 emergency could effectively wipe a family out a significant portion of them and what he's talking there is about a thousand dollars so a relatively what should be a normal thing you think that with all the work that we've put in as a society and as individuals over the past 100 years plus our technology how our society is advanced we should be able to go somewhere relatively close by if a person who is close to us dies that seems like a thing that we should expect to be able to do we don't vocalize it that way but for 60% of America we can't actually live that dream see how the statistics and I also love that they throughout when they would introduce each new section they had video testimonials from around the country of affected I saw right near us in California I sat down in the south and all over the place of individuals and their experiences and how I had to do with different sections of the town hall and I really think that you need both of those things you need to be able to talk about the broad trends and how they change over times and statistics can be very powerful in showing that but you also need to focus on individual people and their lives so that people understand that these are not simply numbers that these are experiences as people are living right now when we close off this Town Hall they will still be living that when the primaries end they will still be living that and it's something that needs to be addressed and so I'm glad that they balanced both of those things yeah John great point you almost never see poor people on TV and almost the only time you see it is in reality shows where they're basically being made fun of and and so it was a little jarring to see people who weren't perfectly groomed because everybody on TVs polished and groomed so it's almost like The Hunger Games in and they've got the elaborate outfits and you never see what's happening in the districts so in this case even in those small little videos they showed between the segment's you got to see real Americans and some of it is great and some of it is tough to watch and and I don't mean that in terms of their personality or character obviously but in terms of what they have to live through and suffer through the that John was talking about 60% of Americans and Michael Moore mentioned this in the beginning can't afford a funeral for a loved one what are you gonna do somebody your family member died your mom your dad your kid and you can't afford a funeral what do you have to do and you're gonna get knocked out by a small financial emergency let alone the funerals then you got for another stat that was mentioned by again Derek Hamilton was 44% of homeless have a job they they're actually employed but they still can't afford a home so it I want to show you one of the ways that they rigged the system because again enforcing that it's choice let's go to graphic 103 here this is the taxes in 1952 when we had amazing productivity and amazing wages in America corporations paid 32% of all taxes by 2015 that was down to ten point eight and now that the Trump administration has massively cut their taxes again it's going to be way lower than that and what do they do they shifted taxes on to the middle class in the payroll tax that's social insurance and retirement you see that it was nine point seven percent less than ten percent in 1952 in 2015 it was thirty three and a half percent of all taxes paid and soon it'll be much greater than that that is how they rigged the rules there are many other things and and finally one other thing that they talked about they had Cindy strana on from UAW Terry talked about unions as striking and celebrated the West Virginia strikes as they should tomorrow on the program I'll talk about the Kentucky possible strike for for teachers there as well and now Arizona Oklahoma all considerin teacher strikes and and the reason that they began the strikes in the first place today and back in the day when they originally created unions was for collective bargaining what does that mean it means if one of you guys is going up against your boss you're screwed but if all the workers unite and they do bargaining at a collective level you then you've gathered up your leverage and you have an even playing field yeah without that even playing field you don't have equality of opportunity don't have leverage and you have no chance so look I sometimes unions frustrate me from from some of the positions that they take and I think they put a lot of money in politics as well but unions is a concept where the workers get together and have some leverage to even the playing field is exactly right otherwise the worker has no chance at all so those are the ways that you unring the system so we can go back to actually enjoying the fruits of our labor that's that first chart where you you are just as productive as you have ever been but your wages do not show it let me give you two more stats about the differences the two differences between those lines let's put up graphic 102 one more time there's two stark amazing facts about this the difference between the two lines is that span of time is about 12 trillion dollars that's 12 trillion dollars of wealth that has been taken away from the American worker and redistributed to the top so you know they talk about class warfare whenever the middle class fights back but when the upper class rigs the rules on their behalf and takes 12 trillion dollars from you they don't call a class warfare but it was and one more amazing stat about that if our productivity had kept up with our if our wages had kept up with our productivity on average the average American would be making $17,000 more per year you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the revolution if you'd like
