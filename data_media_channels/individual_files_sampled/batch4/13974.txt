so what should we talk about today Trump's new budget or porn are we more interested in discussing our concerns over deficit spending or chatting about naked people having sex on film take your time and think about the pros and cons if we talk about the budget we can look very serious and display our virtue by lecturing each other about the spiraling federal debt if we talk about porn we can look very serious and display our virtue by condemning degrading and exploitative sex while at the same time picturing images of degrading and exploitive sex in our minds possibly sex involving two women at the same time just possibly if we talk about the budget we might learn where the true sources of spending trouble really lie and begin to conceive a realistic idea about the actual problems facing our nation that politicians aren't going to do anything about if we talk about porn we might learn about a few offbeat sexual techniques that will drive your partner to wildly ecstatic new heights of self disgust and hospitalization maybe we should combine the two subjects for instance we could talk about the budget while naked or have sex while going broke which is actually the story of my life the truth is whether you're talking about the president's budget or porn you're probably going to end up discussing outlandish scenarios that are almost certainly never going to happen and if we're going to talk about outlandish scenarios that will probably never happen why don't we talk about something really interesting like whether anyone in the corrupt Obama administration will ever be held accountable and go to jail but feel free to take your clothes off while we're talking trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right hooray it's the mailbag tomorrow so

pronounce but cheap you know I actually I'm going to talk about porn later in the show which is kind of a it's actually an important subject but what came into my mind is I was thinking about porn you know the scenario is important unrealistic and they never happened but they're very powerful in your imagination I was thinking the same thing is almost true but almost everything that we talked about in politics so Trump put out his budget yesterday and of course president's budget never gets enacted it's always just to kind of dream a kind of a vision statement as you would if you will and he puts this out and people start talking as too much spending it's so much debt and I was thinking even these things these these Christ that exists in our imagination sometimes they can create themselves and that's why everybody is always battling to own the territory of your imagination but even the debt involves your imagination just because something exists in your imagination doesn't mean it's imaginary I think Harry Potter said that I wrote it many years ago but I think a it's also an Harry Potter just because something exists lots of important stuff goes on in your imagination the country the country exists in your imagination we believe this is a country therefore it's a country but one of the most important things that exists in people's imagination is money if you are running a store and you think boy if I can just earn enough money I can buy a pair of shoes and you get enough money and you buy a pair of shoes and you come to me the shoemaker and I say yeah I don't take money I don't do money you can't get your money is worthless if I stop imagining that this money but but the big question always is does your imagination line up with reality I imagine the country of Brazil if I go to Brazil will it really be their money once we all agree to it actually does represent something real it represents the value we put on things and that's how money gets his value from the map the imaginary trust we put in the money the reason the debt is so important is because if the debt goes up beyond our GDP if we start to owe more than we can possibly pay back people lose confidence in our money and so they stop imagining that America the American dollar is the bulwark of the global economy and that's bad right that's bad for us that's what happened to Greece basically people stopped saying well I'm not loaning Greece any money because they can't possibly pay it back and suddenly you know we don't we don't want to become Greece when they talk about us becoming Greece they don't mean we're gonna have ancient buildings and beautiful beaches that's not what they mean they beautiful to get a food and you're gonna be pushing wheelbarrows full of cigarettes so that's why the debt is is you know important I mean it's that's why the imagination is important so I was thinking about this I'm thinking about all these investigations and we were investigating you know was the Hillary Clinton investigation mismanaged we're investigating investigations were investigating of course the Russian collusion and now our investigating was the investigation into the Russian collusion mishandled and wasn't untrustworthy and all this stuff and thinking you keep saying why isn't anybody going to go to jail you know and and do people ever go to jail is this whole investigation thing just a kind of political show where nobody ever ever gets you know held accountable I mean we now are fairly certain that he's got a coin to coin a protest sign Obama spied and Hillary lied you know we we now feel I feel pretty sure that the Obama administration used Hillary Oppo research to get a FISA word to spy on an American now that American Carter page had worked about a month before for the Trump campaign and so it just seems likely to me that when they were spying on him they were really spying on the Trump campaign there's been some really weird developments in this recently just just now Susan Rice on Inauguration Day she sent herself an email okay about a meeting she had with Obama in which Obama told investigators that the leak law dogs and the FBI and the Justice Department I want everything handled by the book this is Susan's writing to herself because Trump has been and you remember after Trump was elected there's all this talk about they still could stop the election if only the Elector the electors wouldn't give him the electoral votes and maybe there'd be something else that would happen maybe you know a recount who knows we're talking about all this different stuff they really did not could not believe that this was actually going to happen and so Susan Rice writes herself an email saying Obama wants this Russian investigation by the book and Lindsey Graham has written a letter to Susan Rice she was the national security adviser she was the woman who went on and lied about Benghazi like five times in one morning she went on five different talk shows so Lindsey Graham was talking about why he thinks she wrote herself this letter what I'm worried about is this an effort by the President to basically get himself on the record through Susan Rice to make sure that from his point of view everything was done by the book the question is did the president know anything about the FISA warrant application that Susan Rice know that the warrant application included a dossier from mr. Steele when he was on the payroll of the Democratic Party coming from Russian sources that he was a political operative being paid by the Democratic Party and that the information in the a warrant application was a dossier that was political in nature and that mr. Steele hated president Trump candidate Trump was trying to do everything he could to beat him that's not exactly by the book that's not exactly by the book and now they're talking about what did Obama know and when did he know and that's serious stuff of course they're only talking about it on Fox News because the rest of the news media is doing its best to colonize your imagination so you don't get outraged at what your government was doing you know when when Obama was in office and running basically the federal government like it was an arm of the Democrat Party and using the levers of power against his political opponents the other thing that came out that has just come out and this is Byron New York was just doing such great work he was writing about the that he says according to two sources familiar with the meetings James Comey told lawmakers that the FBI agents who interviewed Mike Flynn did not believe that Flynn had lied to them and this is important because Flynn confessed to lying but now it seems that they had nothing on him remember Flynn was supposed to have talked to the Russian ambassador and we know we've been some of the reporters I think at the post have seen the Washington Post I think have seen the transcript of that discussion and we know he didn't do anything wrong he was allowed to do that Trump had been elected he was contacting a Russian ambassador they have the transcript he didn't do anything wrong but Muller Robert Muller says that he lied to them flame is now letting it out kind of through sources that he was just stuck he was tie he was running out of money to defend himself he was tired of being hounded by the the feds and you know the feds and police do this to you too you know they pull you over and they say were you driving and you say no we're gonna charge you with reckless endangerment you'll go away for 10 years unless you confess to you know drunk and driving and then we'll give you a slap on the wrist and so people there's all kinds of pressures they can bring to bear to get you to confess the things you didn't do and and this is stuff so one investigation really does seem to be unraveling this Russian investigation seems to be unraveling the New York Times a former newspaper published a piece today a Q&A where people were allowed to write in to have it explained to them about the Russian investigation and somebody wrote in liberal wrote in and said you know I'm tired of this this is like this anti Russian cold war stuff is this is this investigation mean anything and the answer you should go read it for yourself because the answer is like yeah it means I'm Mike Flynn confessed to something and then another guy and that didn't have anything to do with Russia but yeah it's important you know like basically no they got nothing so so now now the Conservatives are saying somebody has got to pay for this Louie Gohmert was going crazy about this Louie Gohmert was one of the congressmen I really like and trust and this is cup 13 he says that the stuff that's coming out about Obama and Hillary is so bad someone has got to pay I am shocked really shocked that no FISA judge has put anybody in jail yet yet we have found total disregard for a propriety before the FISA courts and somebody should have been in jail long before now over them though were the end proprieties that were submitted to the court so Devin Nunez the you know cuz I get asked this question all the time if we get in the mail bag I get it on Facebook is anybody gonna go to jail Devin Nunez explains that he's the head of the house Intel committee he explains why that they can investigate forever but they can never put anybody in jail without basically the American people starting to realize what all this stuff means in the legislative branch of government we provide oversight right so so we we look at these these agencies we can investigate them and at the end of the day we can make criminal referrals but criminal referrals only we don't have a we don't have people that can go out and arrest people and bring them down to the Capitol and hold them at the you know in the bowels of the Capitol all we can do is make criminal referrals so if DOJ and FBI are not going to prosecute what what seem to be very clear cases like with Christopher still lying to them or if they're not going to investigate clear felonies like the leak of a very highly sensitive classified information in terms of phone calls that were intercepted if they're not going to go after those at some point the Bucs going to have to stop someone and we you know we will continue our investigation but I think ultimately it will be the American people who will put the pressure not only on Congress but the other branches of government to make sure that justice is served Congress has no police force that has no jail it can't arrest people even for even if they're held in contempt even if they lie it cannot do anything to these people it needs you it needs us it needs the people to start to say this because basically they're asking the DOJ to investigate the DOJ they're asking the FBI to investigate the FBI and you know how that story ends so basically they when I when I said before that money gets its power and it's reality money does have mean something but it only means something if we all agree to that meaning that it will be the thing that means that thing the same thing is true with these investigations it may only matter if we agree that no you know no it's not alright for the Obama administration to spy on the opposing party no it's not alright for them to dump a an investigation that would have put you and me in jail just because it's dealing with Hillary Clinton we have to get outraged and that's what all this stuff is about it is fighting to keep you from seeing that from to keep you from feeling that to keep the American people from knowing what's going on in not just in their minds we kind of know what's going on on our minds it's knowing in your heart and your imagination it's imagining that this has to be that justice has to be done I will go on with this in a in a moment I forgot that I don't forget to mention the tennis share walkers with us I think I did she is coming on after the break she's from campus reform they're the ones who do those great videos in which they expose leftist bias on campus so we're gonna talk to her about those and about what is going on on our campuses first though we have to talk about the post office and as you know I'm a big post-office fan writers live and die on the post office you know most of my life I've spent standing like who was it was it Snoopy in the Charlie Brown used to stand next to the mailbox that's the

that's what's happening on the right that's the right trying to get hold of your imagination which will I think are increasingly seeming to be the facts the left of course is stuck on robbed border because they feel that basically they feel that their women can be gold they feel that women are gullible and they can fool them and you got to hear this that with you know rob Porter he's the guy right he was accused by two of his wives of abusing them once as it was emotional abuse the other put out a picture of her with a black eye that apparently robbed Porter took the picture we don't know we don't know why this guy why this guy wasn't fired before Trump has been kind of ham handed in his trumpian way he hasn't come out and said it he you know the president should come out and say well it's never right to hit your wife you know and all unless she's really annoying you know Donald Trump that's what he would say but hey no but Trump should come out and say something about this but he doesn't he keeps saying you know well Porter says he's innocent and the allegations or you know untested allegations are bad and all this all that is fair but you do want to talk to women so the left is just going after women as hard as they can trying to get them really ginned up about this and here this is I love this is it you know CNN has become postmodern it's you can actually watch them building a lie into a narrative and building a narrative into a news story and here they are there's a couple for here is a CNN panel telling itself that yes we are winning they're buying these stupid women are buying our narrative listen to this you can make a prediction that this is sort of the beginning of something that actually don't mean let's just assert it the Russia investigation has not done Donald Trump much political harm do you think that defending men who abuse women and men accused of sexual misconduct is gonna be the thing that starts to eat away even at his 35% I think it's been chipping away at him ever since the Access Hollywood will video had his voice saying the kind of derogatory women the language of sexual assault coming in his own voice from his own mouth and I think that it's continuing now to these stormy Daniels payout yeah I know that I disagree but but he's a job you can tell from milania's bearing and the way that she publicly is handling herself in the White House that she's not happy this narrative is sunk in love users but my husband needs a job like that's not that's not reality these people want reality we have a narrative we have a narrative and you know but unbelievably CNN brings on a panel of Republican women who speak such common sense to them obviously how do you see nobody is in favor of spousal abuse we all know it's a villainous horrible thing to do but things get these Republican women come in to CNN and they speak such clear truth to them that he kind of gives you hope that that maybe the people are listening to reality instead of to the news media let's just play this is a kind of a long cut but it's worth it's worth listening because they just it's just the only time on CNN you ever hear any kind of common sense if the president walked on water the press would say he doesn't know how to swim he's become a little bit I guess over criticize these Republican women from Miami all support President Trump and to say strongly would be an understatement but what about this weekend's tweet about how people's lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation it was just right he said some are guilty and some are not and not every accuser is telling the truth and I think that's important to know in his tweet the president didn't mention Rob Porter by name but he also failed to mention Porter's two ex-wives who claimed they were physically abused by the now former White House aide some might look at this tweet and say the president is dismissing Rob Porter's ex-wives I think that he's speaking generally I think he's speaking from his own position as someone that has been accused wrongfully accused so I give him the benefit of the doubt do you think the president's compassion may have been misguided I don't think that it means that he doesn't have compassion for it I think that if you leave something out of a sentence or you leave someone out it doesn't mean that you're not thinking about them I think that we're victimizing the president if you will by the sunset every single word every single tweet that he puts out is being scrutinized to the last molecule I think what he what he voiced is valid should we take the victims into consideration absolutely but should lives be condemned without due process absolutely not so despite this tweet you all do believe that he is a great supporter of women and stands up as women do you expect your president to be a voice for women he's not my moral leader he's not my marriage Oh counsel he is our president and he's doing a great job law have you walked on water they say he couldn't swim that is absolutely true and listen now you know I've always talked about the problems I have with Trump this things that he doesn't does that I don't like but the the media has just blown themselves up attacking him so desperately and they have no other strategy CNN is now talking about laying off some of the guys and their digital divisions because I don't know they say that they're the Trump bump as they call it has given them all these new viewers and better ratings and better profits but they're talking about laying people off I mean soon there's gonna be CNN people X CNN laid off CNN people standing by the side of the road with little signs that say you know we'll lie for food and I think you know that's very sad but at the same time I think they're failing I literally think that the voice of reality is overwhelming the voice of the culture let me just play one last thing that that is on this show homeland which homeland had one good season the first season and now it's kind of gone off there as well as a show time I think it is so now they have a female president they introduced last year and she was supposed to be I guess like Hillary Clinton maybe when they realized that wasn't gonna play out they've now turned her into Donald Trump and they there was an assassination attempt on her and she is now arresting members of Congress you know it let's not play it it's ridiculous I don't I don't even want to play it but I mean this is what they're selling you they're selling you this whole world of danger and crisis and a scandal that's not actually happening and it matters that matters the imagination of the people become the reality of the country just like when we imagine money it takes on value when you imagine that a crime is worth punishing suddenly people are held accountable who would not be otherwise held accountable so you are in charge of your imagination and your imagination is in charge of the country because they have to serve it they have to and that's why and that's why I'm always yelling and screaming about taking back entertainment taking back news media not just complaining about them doing it and especially taking back the universities and speaking of the universities we're about to talk to a woman Hannah share Locker from campus reform but first I have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to the Daily wire comm and subscribe and you could watch the entire show just sitting there with a beer what is it like 10:00 in the morning forget the beer all right come on over to the Daily wire calm all right we have let me start by just showing you what campus reform does we played campus reform videos all the time they just a lot one of the things they do is they go on campus and they talk to students about their kind of left-wing ideology their ignorance the things they know here is one they put out of talking about how conservative women are treated on campus the conservative women are sort of looked at as an I women personally I think they're just like not educated or maybe hiding something I don't know there has to be something wrong power to everyone that has our opinions that I feel like most women need to be liberal today's day just because we obviously are still not treated equally well what would you say the response towards conservative women is here on this campus it's definitely more of a negative approach to conservative women yes people aren't very comfortable sharing that because they're afraid of backlash I just think that like liberal women or more welcomed on college campuses because they're so liberally biased I would say definitely more beneficial to be liberal or progressive here I feel like if you're this kind of sucks I feel like if you're a conservative women woman you kind of get like people don't really respect you as much and they're kind of harsh - you would think there's been more backlash against conservative ideas if you have opposing views - the majority I guess it's not very accepted acceptable Hannah sure locker is one of these conservative ill-educated bigoted conservative women she's the programming manager as well as an opinion writer for campus reform and I just loved their stuff I played here all the time her last piece of campus reform deals with how and why being an open conservative on today's college campuses is a risky proposition she also found that an anti-sex trafficking nonprofit and I'd love to talk to her about that if there's time Hannah have we got you yeah that's good - it's good to hear you I can't see you but I'll assume you're I assume that people can see it so oh there you are good to see you you know let's start with campus reform because all I really know about them are these videos which I love where do they come from how did they get started so the videos are just one part of what campus reform does we really we published about nine to ten stories a day just really exposing the liberal bias and abuse on college campuses so we started with the Leadership Institute we planted about nineteen hundred conservative and libertarian student groups on campuses across the nation and these students started running into a lot of problems like free speech zones and they started getting their their grade docked for things like not being politically correct or gender-neutral pronouns and they found themselves in a really difficult situation they were being treated unfairly for their conservative views and nobody was reporting on it no one was paying attention to these issues no one knew what was going on the mainstream media ignored it so there was really a void and that's where campus reform kind of came in in 2009 and we started reporting on these issues and exposing them and it turns out the American people were really interested in these stories and now almost every conservative outlet has a section dedicated to higher education because people are really concerned you know parents want to know where they're sending their students taxpayers want to know what their what their taxes are going to funding these ridiculous programs which I'm sure we'll get into later but it really is just crazy to see what these institutions of higher indoctrination as I like to call them from turning into well is it really that bad I mean I know conservatives get so upset about this and we have you know we have Ben Shapiro here goes out and gives speeches and starts riots you know which is unbelievable you know and they keep they keep saying you know well Ben is bring making the campus unsafe and I keep thinking Ben comes in here every day and we're all perfectly safe it's not him doing me the causing the trouble but is this is this really as bad a problem as conservatives think it really is and you know sometimes we can laugh at it when we see the courses out there like fighting fat phobia at Princeton or the University of Pennsylvania course called how to waste time on the Internet we laugh at those but you know for the students I work with I work with a network of 100 student journalists on all different campuses across the country public and private and they really are there risking their reputation their academic standing and often their safety just to stand up for their most basic First Amendment rights on their college campuses and they really do fake-face the backlash for it we have students look at look at Berkeley they're in the middle of several lost lawsuits that College Republicans are right now so these students they go to school thinking they're gonna have a good time you know drink some beer get an education hang out with friends but they're learning at 19 20 years old how to file a lawsuit how to stand up against their strainers and professors it really is bad it's it's you know it's a daily struggle for them just to exist as a conservative on college campuses they're routinely spit on harassed and stalked at Birth low you look like you were talking about ben shapiro i mean he can't even speak on a college campus without absurd security fees and protests and riots breaking out you know i i get people write to me all the time students write to me all the time how can i live with integrity in this atmosphere where it's gonna cost me grades cost me you know friends people must come to you all that i mean i just imagine when i see those guys going out and doing those videos i just imagine people students must come to them and say basically help get me out of here do you have advice for people like how do you maneuver through college without getting thrown out without getting ostracized and yet have integrity what would you tell those people well you really can't guarantee they won't face the face the backlash or the ostracized in class that's honestly the reality of the climate on campus but the most important thing students can do is is know their rights and know their principles I always tell the students I work with know how to defend principles and and not people know your rights know how know your your school's policy is a lot of times students are told they can't speak or they can't hand out constitutions or host an event but really when you look at the school's policy the schools are breaking their own rules so as long as students are aware of their rights aware of their campus policy it's even on the private schools I'm knowing the the policies they have that can really help students along the way but like I said they we can't guarantee they won't face being ostracized but campus reform you know we we put these students on national television and and we're really starting to see students get their voice back they see other students go on TV talk about their stories on national television and you can see they're starting to feel empowered they realize groups like campus reform are our standing behind them to expose their stories to give them the legal action they need to stand up to their universities but it's it's a long arduous battle you know it's it's so funny to see how the campus left is reacting ever since since Trump got elected president you know that the political correct ceiling is just absolutely shattered and college campuses are just in a perpetual state of outrage and they will do anything to silence conservatives you know I work out here in Hollywood and obviously the situation is kind of the same but the one difference in Hollywood is of course they have to make money and so they there is this little shift going on where there is some conservative entertainments of Christian entertainment being made because it pays the bills it brings in the money so they do their woke you know identity politics garbage which bombs repeatedly and then they will occasionally make something for actual human beings who want to see it what is the recourse I mean people appearance especially are paying money to have their children turned into little monsters you know who can't even have a discussion without feeling destroyed well what is the recourse I mean what is the best way that parents and the rest of us can fight back well like I said just knowing their rights really knowing their most basic principles and also just exposing the stories and calling your lawmakers calling local officials you know holding professors and administrators accountable is the biggest thing a lot of times you know these universities they cower to their their donors and their alumni once the stories are out there the biggest thing is just spreading awareness of what's really going on these campuses a lot of times what we see this is a top-down approach it's not so much I always say you can't blame the students for for being indoctrinated the way that they are this is coming from a top-down approach from an administrators we see administrators not only turn a blind eye to what's really going on but they reward it so the professor at Orange Coast College who called Trump's election an act of terrorism was awarded faculty of the year and the professor at California State University who was caught on camera as we reported punching and physically assaulting a college Republican on campus he was recently just reinstated so this behavior is rewarded so what we really need is accountability we need to constantly keep putting pressure on the schools to do something about it we at campus or forum we keep track of you know what we call campus victories where we see a policy change or a university apologizing for an extreme liberal bias or abuse so that number continues to grow only because students are you know they keep coming to us with these stories sometimes they have to send an anonymous tip because they're so afraid of the a clash in that case we report on it but it's really just about the pressure keeping pressure on and what about Trump you know you mentioned him and you mentioned the backlash man I it's something I've seen in Hollywood too just drove the left insane he drives the left and saying but the other thing that I hear is that people college age kids do not like Donald Trump that they don't like the cut of his jib they don't like the way he talks they fear they take on board some of this idea that he's racist which actually that I don't think is true but but they do seem to dislike do you get that feedback as well oh absolutely the rhetoric on campus the anti-trump rhetoric is just off the charts it's funny you were playing that video earlier of the sentiment of conservative women on college campuses and you know the the campus left likes to tell you if you're a female you have to fit inside of the small progressive feminists box that they want to put you in but and they call that women's empowerment but when I look at President Trump in his cabinet we see more women elected to high ranking positions than ever before in history and then we see professors at the new school tweet a storm of tweets saying you know to thank to her students if you're a conservative woman if you attended the March for Life then sit down and shut up so essentially the campus left is saying if you don't look it or if you don't think exactly like we do sit down and shut up you are morally depraved unworthy of being part of the conversation and this is all rooted in this this anti conservative group think Trump hating perpetual state of outrage that we're seeing on college campuses and yes it's very much an anti Trump rhetoric we see courses offered on at Ivy League schools on how to resist Trump we saw up just the other day we've reported on a northeastern professor we recorded him in class saying that he hopes president Trump dies and this is the norm on college campuses it's it's just typical what about on the right though I wonder about right wing students conservative students I mean there are obviously people in the conservative movement who don't like Trump our conservative students put off by Trump I mean is he hurting the conservative cause of the Millennial level do you you know it's it's a big mix of everything that the real difference is that the conservatives from what I see on campuses at least willing to have a conversation about it and that's the main difference between the campus left and the campus right on the campus right the students I work with range from libertarian to conservative and everything in between but the bottom line is they have their differences about Trump but they talk about it they engage in robust dialogue and debate and they want to understand and you know they have reasons for not supporting Trump not every conservative college student is on the Trump train and I respect that they at least talk about it though a real problem on college campuses is it's the end of conversation we don't want to hear it at all we don't even want to hear you say his name you know it's amazing people come in here to the daily wire and who have worked for left-wingers and are always shocked by the level of debate and openness and conversation and friendly friendly even though intense debate that goes on and they always say they never see that on the liberal side so basically a final question about this are you are you hopeful about this I mean do you feel like the tide is turning or there's any light at the end of the tunnel use as many cliches as I possibly can you know slowly but surely we are starting to see some differences for the better at the same time it is a scary place to be when we're seeing my entire generation of student entire generation leave campus completely indoctrinated I look at Google you know the average age of a Google employee is 28 years old that's my age this is my generation and we see James d'amour get fired for writing a memo about the biological differences between men and women this is my generation that pushed him out and completely silenced him and I think we're going to see more and more of that infiltrate the workplace if we don't nip this in the bud and start holding universities and higher education accountable we can only expect more behavior like that in the workplace you know if students are hiding running and hiding in their safe space when they hear president Trump's name or a conservative idea how are we these students supposed to you know enter the real world where they have to deal with leaders like Kim jong-un or deal with us the complex issues we face as a nation so I really do worry about the future and that's why I work with campus or forum because I really do see the implications that this has on society at large if we don't stop this great Anna thank you very much you know I noticed as I was reading your introduction which I did no until I was reading your introduction that you have founded an anti-sex trafficking nonprofit I would really like you to come back on and talk about that I feel is one of the Buried issues of the day basically a slave trade going on under our nose so I hope you come back again and talk to me about that as well absolutely thanks very much Hannah it's really good talking to thanks so much talk to you soon boy that gives me hope come on you know she's worried but I feel better you know let's go to sexual follies so the New York Times magazine wrote a heartbreaking piece which was heartbreaking not only in what it said but in the it's the moral stupidity of the newspaper reporting that the the world when you enter the New York Times you enter the world of the new New York East Coast elite liberal and sometimes it's very sad place to be and this thing was called why what teenagers are learning from on-line porn by maggie smith now one thing that happens is adults sometimes look at young people and they think oh in this day and age there's so much talk about sex there's so much talk about there's so much porn available there's you know people say anything there's class is that kids must know a lot about sex that we didn't know that may be true but they still don't they still don't really know of course not until you get into the world of dating and loving and interaction with real live human beings you don't know anything you don't know anything about sex and so people are learning from they take learning from things like porn any you know you all remember what it's like you go get any information anywhere you can and so in this piece it which is well researched they interview these people and one kid says it gets in your head you know you don't know whether girls want sex or what they what if they want you to do the things that they do in porn you don't know whether the girls are gonna be disappointed by the fact that you don't look like the guys and in porn I mean I do but I mean other people not and and you know it just it just the the women obviously important or sometimes mistreated it's sometimes rough then the other woman loves just being roughed up and and hurt and all this stuff and they don't know whether this is true so the answer in this article or at least one answer that's proposed is a class on what is called porn literacy what could possibly go wrong right so this is reading from the article the course with the official title the truth about pornography a pornography literacy curriculum for high school students designed to reduce sexual and dating violence is a recent addition to start strong a pure leadership program for teenagers headquartered in Boston's South End and funded by the city's public health agency about two dozen selected highs students attend every year most of them black or Latino along with a few Asian students from Boston public high schools including the city so on and on during most of the year the teenagers learned about healthy relationships dating violence and LGBT issues as opposed to English and history and math but often through group discussions role-playing and other exercise you know I mean so what they're teaching them is the point isn't necessarily reality now I mean that's a very sad answer it's a very sad answer and yet and yet what are the other answers Ross do thought in reaction to this piece Ross truth out is the Catholic op-ed writer who used to be a lot better before Trump but now I think the New York Times just does not let people write what they actually think anyway he now he wrote a piece called let's ban porn and he says the belief that it should not be restricted as a mistake the belief that it can not be censored is a superstition law and jurisprudence changed once to allow porn and can change again and while you can find anything somewhere on the internet making hardcore porn something to be quested after in dark corners would dramatically reduce its pedagogical role its cultural normalcy its power over libidos everywhere and Peter Sudirman at reason of course reason is a libertarian sight they don't wanna ban anything he says he answers due thought by saying to start with you would need to stop the production of porn by business enterprises forcing at minimum every person who has ever attended the Adult Video News Awards in a professional capacity to immediately find a new line of work you would need to find a way to stop a slew of high-profile incredibly lucrative websites from posting hosting or otherwise distributing explicit materials after you crack down on the pros you would need to go after amateurs by finding some way to stop tens of millions of iPhone wielding Americans from making home movies many of which would resemble professional products and quality you know what what's interesting about this not men at might by nature I'm a libertarian but I really see this as a plague and it's not the plagues not porn the plague is an attitude to the human body and to human relationships that was sold to us by the left all from the 60s to today and now that they're reaping the whirlwind they don't like it very much it's interesting when you look at the great ages of civilizations if you think about the Augustine age of the ancient Rome if you think about the Victorian age if you think of the American 1950s they're all marked by at least an outward display of prudery and it's always pretty that comes after a libertine age so in America we have the 1920s and the 1930s and anything goes you know in the olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked onto something shocking many thing goes but by the 1950s not so much and that was the Golden Age of this generation of this cycle of Americanism Victorian age same thing in the 1700s lots of sex lots of books about sex oh you know Tom Jones and and things like that by the 1800s by the Victorian age everybody is as you know very prudish but that's also the great that's probably one of the greatest ages of human civilizations but one of the things is is that with that comes a new respect for women in the household and the Victorians would call her the eighth nickel the angel in the house the angel in the house and of course in the 1950s the housewife was one of the key elements of all entertainment all ideas so what's interesting is the feminism feminism has always had this reactionary shadow okay first they say yes where men and women should have the same kind of sex and then oh my god you know women are being abused this is no good this is no good they've always had this idea that men's desires should be prohibited it's sex that porn was bad they've always had a strain of feminism the porn would bethe and would be interesting if feminism morphed in the same way that the left has morphed the side of free speech has now morphed into the side of no speech it would be interesting and I do think this could happen that feminism morphs into actual feminism the defense of women in their roles as guiding families guiding men civilizing men now when you say that without women men would be uncivilized feminists start screaming at you and say it's not our role to feminize to civilize men it's not our role to civilize men and yet they don't like living in a world without civilized men in it and women are the only things that civilized men do you know all this me too movement is living in a world where women have lost their power to civilize men have lost their mission to civilize men have lost their mission to form men in families and in in marriage and they don't like so much what happens when that looks like yet when they don't so much what that looks like when that actually actually happens so I have many times predicted a new Victorian age is coming I do believe that is true and it will be interesting to see if feminism morphs into the leader of some of that Victorian prudery and some of that Victorian elevation of the family alright the mailbag is tomorrow hit go to The Daily wire calm it podcast at the Andrew Klavan podcast at the
