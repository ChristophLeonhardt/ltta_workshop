IS STILL  CONTINUING  BECAUSE 

635
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,252
THE RIVERS ARE RISING IN

CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR STATE. 

637

THERE ARE NOT MORE, NOT ANOTHER 

650
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,627
LIFE LOST BUT WE KNOW THAT 

651
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,194
RAGING RIVERS ARE STILL OUT 

652
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:45,063
THERE AND MORE LIVES CAN BE 

653
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:45,329
CLAIMED.

. 

663
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,651
>> FIRST, I THINK NUMBER ONE 

664
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,220
THE ANSWER IS YES, THAT IT DOES 

665
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,422
INCLUDE THE TODDLER  TRAGICALLY 

666
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,024
DIVIDE IN UNION COUNTY. 

667
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,126

OFFICE  AND THEY ARE WORKING ON 

670
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,234
SOME ARRANGEMENTS FOR THAT. 

671
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,537
WE'REGOING TO HAVE A NUMBER OF 

672
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:30,976

AND HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY 

675
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,580
AND I'M SURE THERE WILL LIKELY 

676
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,184
BE OTHERS AS WELL.     

677
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,720

WATER IN THIS STATE AND ARE YOU 

683
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:52,496
THINKING ABOUT PLANNING FOR 

684
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:52,696
THAT? 

685
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:56,768
ANDALSO JUST  THE PUBLIC 

686
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,003
RESOURCES NEEDED TO COPE WITH 

687
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,371
SOMETHING LIKE THIS? 

688
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,872

689
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,074
SMART ABOUT OUR RECOVERY.    

690
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:03,607
AND ABOUT OUR LONG RANGE 

691
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:07,445
PLANNING.      

692
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,480
WHEN YOU HAVE 2 , 500-YEAR 

693
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,550
FLOODS  WITHIN 2 YEARS OF EACH 

694
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,086
OTHER,    IT'S PRETTY CLEAR 

695
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,522
IT'S NOT A 500-YEAR FLOOD.      

696
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:22,561
SO  AS WE  APPROACH  RECOVERY  

697
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,331
BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM, 

698
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,099
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT  FLOODED 

699
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:33,104

700
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:33,672

TO RECOVER. 

708
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:51,056
THERE'S NO QUESTIONABOUT THAT.  

709
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,891
PEOPLE NEED HELP IMMEDIATELY. 

710
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,092

717
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:07,572

718
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,774
. 

719
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,778
>> CAN YOU GIVE US SOME DAYS 

720
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,411
