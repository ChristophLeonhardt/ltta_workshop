00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,830
everyone focused on the website in the

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">campaign is being the real engine but</font>

you say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually email it really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">was email which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of pass</font>

a in many ways when in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of</font>

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,890
Twitter and social networking but the

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,990
you know just some of the anecdotes of

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,849
not only one in five voters were

10
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,919
subscribers but there's you know 3.2

11
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:33,739
million donors and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:35,540
tell the story of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the campaign and 100</font>

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,310
characters or less you can use that as

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,440
the add-on but really if you if you page

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,820
through the thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails that</font>

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,170
people received over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the course of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,210
campaign that was the book that was the

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,399
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the effort it wasn't just</font>

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">from President Obama it was from all the</font>

20
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,570
characters it was the strategy updates

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,429
from David Plouffe it was that sort of

22
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,109
transparency that gave people a

23
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:55,670
willingness to commit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

24
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,769
average person gave 2.3 times that's a

25
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,750
degree of loyalty that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just unheard</font>

26
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,690
of and so when you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so for</font>

27
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,209
example at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Red Cross getting them to</font>

28
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,100
think this way around campaign messaging

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,150
as opposed to a more traditional

30
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,670
newsletter approach makes the work of

31
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,049
the Red Cross more accessible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font>

32
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,479
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just their top of mind when</font>

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,759
a tornado hits or disaster happens but

34
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">they realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ongoing effort is</font>

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,310
in keeping that readiness there that

36
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,899
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to regular messaging in</font>

37
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,990
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my presentations there's the talk</font>

38
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,399
of that sort of shortened approval

39
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:30,860
process during the RNC convention there

40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,649
was no plans on being too active the

41
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't you know our candidate was on</font>

42
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,040
vacation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sarah Palin had been added to</font>

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ticket but then they got on stage</font>

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,299
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rudy Giuliani and then said are</font>

45
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,619
from Sarah Palin and we're really

46
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,750
viciously attacking community organizers

47
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,210
as not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> not qualified to be</font>

48
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,640
President but really just were radicals

49
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,869
and we had built the the campaign had

50
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,560
built an effort that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was based on the</font>

51
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">notion the community organizing was one</font>

52
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,710
of the ways we could sort of save the

53
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,479
country and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't let that go</font>

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,149
unresponsive to and because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

55
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">David Clough down the hall we could</font>

56
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,139
write you know two paragraphs of copy

57
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,880
literally starting I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> planning on</font>

58
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,950
writing this to you tonight but dot dot

59
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,989
it got sent out<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten minutes after Sarah</font>

60
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:16,400
Palin left the stage and was the single

biggest fundraising<font color="#CCCCCC"> F</font>

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,750
of the campaign totally off plan so that

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff that success really breeds</font>

success
