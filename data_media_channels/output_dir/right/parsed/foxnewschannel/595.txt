>> Sandra: PRESIDENT TRUMP
PRAISING JOHN JAMES AS THE
MICHIGAN'S REPUBLICAN SENATE
PRIMARY LAST NIGHT.
THE IRAQ COMBAT VETERAN FACES
INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT DEBBIE
AFTER THE BIG NIGHT LAST NIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.
HOW DO YOU FEEL THIS MORNING?
>> I FEEL GREAT.
I FEEL ENERGIZED.
THE WORK IS STARTING NOW.
FIRST THING I HAVE TO GIVE
GLORY TO GOD FOR THIS AMAZING
VICTORY AND THE PEOPLE IN THE
STATE OF MICHIGAN WHO MADE
THEIR VOICES HEARD.
SUPER EXCITED TO MAKE SURE WE
HOLD SENATOR STABENOW
TWEETING OUT ABOUT YOU SAYING
CONGRATULATIONS TO A FUTURE
STAR OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,
FUTURE SENATOR JOHN JAMES, A
BIG AND BOLD VICTORY TONIGHT IN
A GREAT STATE OF MICHIGAN.
THE FIRST OF MANY.
NOVEMBER CAN'T COME FAST ENOUGH.
ELECTION.
CAN YOU WIN?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
HER NUMBERS ARE PLUMMETING
BECAUSE SHE IS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE RESISTANCE.
DEBBIE STABENOW CARES MORE
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND HAVING
SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO GETS
RESULTS FROM THE BATTLEFIELD TO
THE RESULTS OF BRINGING MY
AIRCRAFT AND MEN HOME SAFELY.
I'M A BUSINESS LEADER GROWING
MY COMPANY AND IMPROVING THE
ECONOMIC SITUATIONS OF OVER 100
FAMILIES IN MICHIGAN EAST OF
THE MISSISSIPPI.
DEBBIE STABENOW VOTES WITH
CHUCK SCHUMER 95% OF THE TIME
AND PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN ARE
WONDERING IF THEIR LIVES WILL
GET BETTER BY BEING OBSTRUCTIVE.
>> Sandra: HOW IMPORTANT WAS
THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT?
THE PRESIDENT TOOK A LEADING
EFFORT IN GETTING THE WORD OUT,
HELPING US GET THE VOTE OUT.
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE
PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT AND
ALSO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WHO
I'M GOING TO BE RUNNING INTO IN
GRAND RAP NIDS A COUPLE HOURS.
WHY YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT U.S.
SENATOR.
YOU SAID I DON'T HAVE A BLACK
ENEMY OF THE STATE.
I SWORE AN OATH TO THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICAN AGAINST ALL
ENEMIES.
BY CONTINUING TO DRIVE A WEDGE
BETWEEN WHAT MAKES US GREAT AND
FOCUSING MORE ON THE ARBITRARY
THINGS THAT SEPARATE US, THAT
IS HOW FOLKS LIKE SENATOR
STABENOW AND CHUCK SCHUMER AND
NANCY PELOSI CONTINUE TO PLAY
THE HAVES AGAINST THE HAVE NOTS.
THE BLACKS AGAINST THE WHITES.
THE MALES AGAINST THE FEMALES
TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN THEIR
POSITIONS IN WASHINGTON
WE NEED TO BREAK THIS DOWN.
I'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT MY
EXPERIENCE, MY ENERGY, MY
ENTHUSIASM AND EMPATHY TO MAKE
SURE WE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF
THE STATE OF MICHIGAN TO STAND
UP FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND
IT'S NOT A BLACK OR WHITE
MESSAGE IT'S A RED, WHITE AND
PEOPLE, GETTING RESULTS, DOING
THE HARD THINGS AND MAKING SURE
WE CAN BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF
THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
WHAT IT MEANS FOR NOVEMBER FOR
YOUR PARTY?
>> PEOPLE WILL NOT BE DECEIVED.
THERE ARE RURAL WHITES WHO HAVE
BEEN DISMISSED BY THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS DEPLORABLE.
URBAN BLACKS DISMISSED AS
WAS FLYING IN.
SENATOR STABENOW HAS BEEN AN
ELECTED OFFICIAL FOR 43 YEARS
AND BEEN IN WASHINGTON FOR 20.
HAS DONE PRECIOUS LITTLE.
SEVEN BILLS PASSED THE LAW.
FIVE TO RENAME BUILDINGS.
MAKING SURE WE GET RID OF
IDENTITY POLITICS AND POLITICAL
CORRECTNESS TO EXECUTE AND GET
SOMEONE WHO WILL WORK WITH OUR
PRESIDENT TO BRING TALENT AND
HELP BRING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY
BACK TO THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.
>> Sandra: IN ADDITION TO THE
OTHER WORDS I READ FROM THE
PRESIDENT EARLIER RARELY HAVE I
HE IS SPECTACULAR.
IF YOU WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION
YOU WILL BE THE SECOND BLACK
REPUBLICAN SENATOR IN CONGRESS
NEXT TO TIM SCOTT FROM SOUTH
CAROLINA.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU?
>> I'M EXCITE I HAD THAT MY
ACROSS THE STREET FROM
MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY
UNABLE TO GO THERE BECAUSE HE
WAS BLACK, NOW HAS A SON WHO IS
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR OF THE
U.S. SENATE.
TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED FOR
BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THE
DEPENDENCY AND VICTIMHOOD THAT
HAVE BEEN FAED TO THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A SITUATION
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT
BOTH TABLES.
WHETHER NEITHER PARTY HAS TO
WORK FOR OUR VOTE THAT'S THE
WRONG ANSWER.
I'M EXCITED TO REPRESENT ALL
PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN AND SERVE
ALL AMERICANS UNDERSTANDING I
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IN COMBAT
AND UNDERSTANDING NATIONAL
SECURITY AND EXPERIENCE IN
BUSINESS, SIGNING THE FRONT AND
BACK OF CHECKS AND
COUNTRY BETTER.
I BELIEVE I'M THE BEST
CANDIDATE BECAUSE OF MY
EXPERIENCE.
DEBBIE STABENOW WILL HAVE A
RACE ON HER HANDS.
>> Sandra: WE'LL SEE HOW IT ALL
GOES DOWN IN NOVEMBER.
YOUR ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY IS
IMPRESSIVE AFTER A BIG NIGHT
LAST NIGHT.
YOU ARE A PROUD AMERICAN AND
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AS A
