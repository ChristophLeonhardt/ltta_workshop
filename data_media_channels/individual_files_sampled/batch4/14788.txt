the leader of the PC party has resigned but when the smoke clears and the dust settles well anything really change for those in Ontario who want to vote for a conservative alternative so within hours of allegations regarding Brown taking part in inappropriate behavior with young woman Brown staff deserted him and his caucus caved in less than 24 hours later Brown was waving the white flag of political surrender now as an aside here we don't know if the allegations of inappropriate behavior are true and Brown denied these allegations in a press conference a couple hours ago I learned about troubling allegations about my conduct and character and I'm here tonight to address them first I want to say these allegations are false categorically untrue every one of them I will defend myself as hard as I can with all means at my disposal still in the here-and-now of the Ontario political universe two huge questions arise in light of Browns dramatic resignation number one who will be the new leader of the PC party and how will he or she be selected and question number two will the PC party continue drifting left-of-center ignoring the wishes of its grassroots constituents as was par for the course under mr. Brown after all this party has alienated not just social conservatives but fiscal and democratic conservatives as well thousands of whom have abandoned the party can you blame them one a patch of Browns first moves after being elected leader was his support for a Trudeau peein style carbon tax even though Ontario is or maybe was a manufacturing province and even though he supposedly campaigned against such attacks prior to being named leader Brown also shamelessly flip-flopped on the Liberals controversial sex ed curriculum and then at local writing nomination meetings allegations of fraud abounded in which was said that Bala boxes were being stuffed to ensure that PC Party insiders and their friends got elected as opposed to the candidate of choice favored by the grassroots so much for democracy case in point Hamilton Police are continuing a criminal probe of unnamed PC members amid allegations of forgery and fraud that took place at the Hamilton West Ancaster Dundas rioting nomination meeting last May this also resulted in the spurned candidate vikramsingh suing the party the lawsuit was recently settled out of court but not before mr. Singh hand up a six-figure legal bill another spurned candidate Jeff Peller also sued the party also alleging ballot box fraud Peller settled his suit last October for undisclosed terms and seemingly driven by fear and outright paranoia the PCs have also conducted legalistic vendetta's against the role members who dare to rock the boat or ask uncomfortable questions just consider the witch-hunt against Jim Hera Hollis who headed up campaigns such as acts of carbon tax and take back our PC party even though the PC party is supposedly committed to openness and transparency it went after Jim with a so-called slap suit a strategic lawsuit against public participation in order to stifle dissent the PCs lost and now Jim is going after the party seeking a hundred and ten thousand dollars to cover his legal fees and more than thirty thousand dollars in special and punitive damages and while hope abounds when it comes to regime change well the status quo change regardless of whoever becomes the new leader as Bob yacek leader of the Trillian party told me despite the resignation of Brown quote nothing has changed in the PC party all the policies are the same all the backroom boys are the same end quote if this is indeed true talk about missed opportunity in 15 years the governing liberals who are now headed up by an extremely unpopular premier have only excelled in the Department of scandals and multi-billion duller boondoggles a health green energy that canceled gas plans orange deleted emails the list goes on and on the PCs should be offering a viable alternative to the electorate not marketing themselves as liberal light and I fear if they continue going down the progressive rather than conservative Road defeat awaits them yet again when Ontarians go to the polls craving something different something new only to be greeted by the same old same old for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks if you like that rant please consider becoming a premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
