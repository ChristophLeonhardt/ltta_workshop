so everybody's making a big deal out of the first round of the primary and the Democrat you can't vote super-delegates don't have they can't weigh in in the first ballot Oh in the second ballot and that haven't got a second ballot since you know Lincoln or whatever so what happens now this is what I think is gonna happen is that the establishment wants Elizabeth Warren to run because she's kind of friendly to the establishment even though she's a progressive mm-hmm and so then she splits they're a progressive vote and then it has to go to a second ballot the soup of a delegates vote and we get Kamala Harris or Cory Booker yeah no no tell me how that doesn't happen no I don't think that happened I just I don't see I don't see them both going that long I think that it could be the case that throughout all those primaries the vote is so closely split but I don't I don't I don't think that's the case based on the polling that I've seen Bernie has a significant advantage over Elizabeth Warren I don't think that she'd be close enough that she would want to especially considering how much affection she has for Bernie she talks constantly you know positively about him and working with him I just don't think that she would risk ruining like how the viewer the voters see her by tanking him if he's clearly winning at that point and just based on talking with now a good percentage of the people on the unity and Reform Commission that the Bernie delegates on they're talking with me to turn this morning that we talked about this issue and with Nomi they're very excited about this reform like I'd previously like I was at one of the the URC meetings and this was more than what they at that point were expecting they would be able to get so the report before it was going to be cutting down the number of super-delegates but they'd still be able to vote in the first case actually eliminating their entire ability to vote in the first round certainly isn't everything but it's pretty strong and I would say that the onus is now on us to make sure that CNN MSNBC and Fox don't still include those votes in our delegate counts because that obviously even before was how they actually had the most impact but if we can if we can shame them out of doing that by pointing out that they can't even vote in the first round then I think they will be pretty effectively hamstrung and that seemed to be what Nina Turner thought this morning okay so I'll answer Jimi's question with a bold prediction because that's how I roll so this is the day after Labor Day in the year 2018 and I will tell you the final four in the Democratic primary for 2020 so Bernie Sanders clear favorite will be in the Final Four Kamala Harris will be in the Final Four Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand so that's the four final entry ladies yes and it is the year the woman and so that by the way will be some advantage to some of those candidates as well and that's god bless well you want a different result than you go out and vote okay women are coming out to vote that's fantastic for Democrats and progressives overall now I think Bernie's the most progressive out of those candidates but I think that he's arguably as good as anyone on women's rights if not better and so here's the people who have no chance Cory Booker okay no chance whatsoever really so I don't care how much the establishment likes him see Jill burns smart she's positioning to be seen as very progressive to the voters but a wink and a nod to the establishment and they don't mind her at all right that's the smart savvy political strategy Booker's bumbling fumbling he's a serial bungler right oh I my pharmaceutical donors say don't import drugs from Canada oh did I get caught with my hand in the drug jar okay so I meant no no sure I'll work with Bernie Sanders they import drugs kind of maybe right and then he says I'm not taking any campaign corporate PAC money hey that's a great thing and I applauded him for that on air I think that's wonderful that's what we're trying to drive at and then later he said the drug companies I will not take any money from them until later Wow come on Joe you're so bad at this yes so know there any any progressive Cory Booker he has no chance okay have you noticed I left Biden out of the top four cuz Biden is a fader and I like Joe Biden he gives a fun speech I love when he leans oohs no no listen listen listen this isn't baloney okay there's so many things I like about you oh boys are my favorite speeches at political rallies yeah when a political once exactly right it's it's fake but it's a fun fake it's like a effective fake they just give a good see he was a great speech but he has never done well in presidential primaries he will not do well in this one the reason why he's polling next to Bernie Sanders in the top right now is because he has enormous name recognition enormous Leoben was ranking number one before the elections got started in oh four why cuz he was Gore's running mate in 2000 but I told you then he'd have no Joe mentum he didn't because people don't actually like him especially Democratic voters especially in primaries so now binds on anywhere near as bad as yo Lieberman but Biden will fade all those other people are posters the clover chars of the world that's funny I'm gonna move on from and that's not a real thing you didn't even put lincoln Chafee in your top four that's what I like about you the bold prediction that's right I mean I don't know if martin O'Malley stops rolling up those sleeves again you don't know okay anyway all lives matter and God knows if Jim Webb cock to brag about that man's gonna kill the new guy right now to go to the courrier question at Jimmy I think John's right all the people who worked on it that are progressives like no Mikey counts I think are happy with this deal so that does give me some comfort you know and lots of good people on our revolution working on this and and they seem relatively happy so on the other hand I do have some issues with it I wish it was stronger I know they were trying to get you know the original deal was they were going to get rid of some portion of the super-delegates right around 60% so I don't know if that's better than them not voting the first round is better since they really are almost never a second round vote so let's call them a couple hundred votes I think if they even if they reduced it by sixty percent but still let them vote that's multiple states worth of Delegates left over yeah so I hear you so it's it's it's tough to judge that one but they they really the establishment went after the caucuses cuz Bernie wins caucuses yeah and and they were pretty effective it yes this reform wound up doing some degree of damage to that progressive cause but that's complicated though because I mean when I was at the URC meetings talking with with Nina this morning there are huge communities that are effectively disenfranchised by caucuses yes and I think being able to be involved in a caucus if you can do that is far superior to just voting yeah I come from Texas where that come from there but I live there for more than half a decade where they do both actually but if you work three jobs you cannot go to a caucus you just can't no no I said immediately in case they made a very good case for it but just understand that this sound was front wing wanted to kill the caucuses cuz Bernie did so well and they accomplished a lot of their mission there and it might be for good reasons and it's a good and open question and no open debate us whether it makes sense or not and that's and it they didn't lie didn't make up stuff those are real concerns and they're not dead yeah the the you know the the federal level DNC or whatever they can't shut down state caucuses yeah I can give incentives which they're doing to try to get States to shift over but they can't actually say you know Iowa you can't do a caucus they don't actually have that power so and and by the way Nina Turner was on the damage report that's John's show you check out that podcast on our app as she also has a her own podcast on our app we the people with Nina Turner so toi t.com slash app or just become a member get all of our shows including Jimmy's 18 shows on the network the Jimmy Dore show the aggressive progressives etc and aggressive progresses just for members TYT Comstock join to become a member and then finally to come back around there the overall point Jimmy I don't think that the the first round second round is a trick for the establishment to put in Harris or Booker I think that they reach the genuine compromise and like I just said I'm not sure it's kind of a mixed compliment that's the point of a compromise it's mixed and it might be to the advantage of progressives or the disadvantage of progressives but I don't think that it was some sort of trick that the other guys went along with okay well I advise view on it is mixed that there's one step forward two steps back Johnny's correct and you're correct that the caucuses do help Bernie they got their trying get rid of those I'm actually I'm as a progressive I wish we had more caucuses because it helps progressives but in the issue of fairness which this goes against my own interest I'm actually against caucuses because I was in Des Moines and I remember I was at I was at a perk ins ordering a country-club omelet sounds good you should have topped it off with the peanut butter chocolate pie that they have which I did how do I not know about this place great perk is you're on American did you notice how he slipped in there doesn't Texas half a decade per has five years that's five years so when I was there I said Perkins they have the holiday sauce on top and I asked the waitress are you caucusing and she's like I can't call cause I that's where it first dawned on me I'm like so every bartender every person who works second shift at a warehouse every waitress they don't get to caucus so I think caucuses are undemocratic so they so even though it hurts progressives I think it's better to get rid of caucuses and if that's fair that's me being fair that's right if you're socially awkward and don't like crowds or talking to people ya can be rough could be that's also true too but understand why it helps progressives and the upside of caucuses is that the people who are most energized go to caucuses right and that by the way is also a sign of how energized your voters are going to be in the channel that's why there are significant upsides to caucuses and although these downsides are very much real so at the end of the day and that whole proceeding wound up with a big giant compromise it was a little bit of this a little bit of that which I get and those guys who were on the Commission who were progresses work super hard at that and and did very good work in at least moving the ball down the field at the same time remember the whole point was unity and Reform Commission it was supposed to be a nod to the Bernie Sanders progressive wing of the party that we are more open and receptive to what you're saying what it wound up with was a little bit of 50/50 as so and as politics and and was there some politics played there yeah absolutely but by the way the these primaries last thing is that they will settle things whoever wins will run the Democratic Party will likely become president will run a lot more than that and so the next time if Bernie were to win or someone else that you consider progressive or to win well we're not gonna have these debates we're gonna have the base where were have the advantage and they're at a disadvantage and all they ever had was money and machine once you take the Machine away they're in a world of trouble
