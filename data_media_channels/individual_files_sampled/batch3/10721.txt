Donald Trump has lashed out at motorcycle maker Harley Davidson over its plans to shift production away from the United States the Harley Davidson is using that as an excuse and I don't like that because I've been very good to Harley Davidson and they used it as an excuse and I think the people that ride Harley's are not happy with Harley Davidson and I wouldn't be either but mostly companies are coming back to our country on Twitter Trump even threatened the company saying that if Harley Davidson move it will be the beginning of the end and they will be taxed like never before Harley Davidson planned to move some of their manufacturing to Europe to avoid paying newly imposed EU tariffs when exporting to the continent the motor bike company says the move will save nearly 100 million dollars a year in taxes well the EU recently slapped import charges on American goods including motorbikes in retaliation against Trump's tariffs on EU steel and aluminium Trump claimed the levies were needed to protect US manufacturing from unfair competition but economist Jeffrey Tucker says American firms have nothing to gain from trade wars this is a consequence of Trump's trade war and it's a classic case of how these government actions tend to have the opposite effect Trump wants to make America great again what he's actually doing is causing more financial pressure for American firms that rely on imported raw goods and for American producers who rely on markets abroad to buy their products so this is very bad American companies will move aspects are their businesses abroad if it's a life or death issue the purpose of business is to serve the cause of business and and to and to stay profitable and to serve their stockholders the purpose of business is not to make Donald Trump happy you
