hey everybody welcome to Business Insider live we are here at Vinny's pizzeria in Williamsburg these are my friends Sean and Jacob say hello and today we are making the pizza box pizza so excited so let's get started all right all right so what's the first thing we do what do we have here the first thing we're gonna do is actually we're gonna make the base all right box so pizza box face I've stretched out a kind of like a box shaped pizza preparation which takes a little while to kind of mold perfectly amazing marinara sauce it's it's different than pizza sauce a little bit thicker is good for like dipping and stuff like that so that's like this part so how many of you actually all kind of do all contribute to make the feedback pizza or one of you use the adventure keys that have been teaching us all how to do all right everybody I'm not here all that I can't be here all the time right everybody here knows how to make it now was it kind of accidental that you came up with this like it was X it was me just kind of whenever it gets a little slow at work I kind of just like to experiment and try different types of pizza and also it was kind of my attempt to I always see people grab boxes people asked for pizza boxes and then they sit down at one of the seats a little bit and then it just kind of blew up and now we make started originally like the cheese can you kind of customize and put your own toppings on nice it just starts from there and just kind of thing all out it's pretty much whatever they want for those of you just joining us or at Vinny's pizzeria in Williamsburg and we're making the pizza box pizza start Freddie Sean normal right here it's kind of like a small mini pizza speaker marinara sauce are we all 100% Italian here I'm so tired and I'm Jewish for everything have you seen anyone actually eat the pizza box pizza by themselves to people they definitely did lots of people think that they can come in and take down the whole thing if you know I've never seen a one person attempt it but I have seen cheap people just like you said two people attempted and they come in with wide eyed and you don't know you don't know me I can do it and then cut to 30 minutes later there's been me the center pine yeah because the whole thing is basically like there's three different types of pizza this middle one is a you know the inside pizza is just a small pizza pepperoni pizza the box is like a Sicilian fluffy extra fluffy resto and then the top is like a garlic bread - Ethan wants to know if it's kosher sorry so this serves how many people would just add 16 now with this mini finally this is a superb mini pie another one of our specialties and some to people we make pizza on pizza what's using the cheese like many slices oh that's so neat we ran out and ladies think of how you feelin you're working hard today I just got here I'll be the hero what I am so three separate parts then for the pizza box people like garlic bread and lots of people oh that's you know by me then people rip this off and we serve it with like sides of marinara sauce and ranch whatever people want and they rip this kind of are your hours of operation one of our viewers we also have a greenway location and there 1132 big night every day 253 NASA Green Point stop by so while that's cooking you can kind of maybe film him making the pizza slice I know it's only to work alright it's called the mini Vinnie busy today Joey's been named sure try all right so you got it okay and he's gonna cut it into really small small pieces you kind of I guess it's easy to kind of break them off right in diem well these are gonna get melted into another pizza oh we call this this topping pizza topped with pizza so this time you don't cut it all the way through you're just making a line so that you know where they go carefully on top of the slices and then it goes back in the oven and they form together like it's very important presentation is very important to us so you place all these nice slices get three our nice warm Johnny slice yeah bigger pie another mini pizzeria special oh yeah it's easier when it gets to cool down for like 20 seconds then someone's waiting on it I obviously want to get it as fast as possible get a format together real quick because they're melting yeah this came out about a year ago and it has been crazy you got it give me one psyche pro screening for me all right beautiful break that apart this stays here for say as all goes in the oven when I come down it'll all be together beautiful see how the sound is gone yeah this one all right this one's not done yet maybe a couple more rounds good we're at Vinny's pizzeria right here in Williamsburg making the pizza box pizzas all right so I'm gonna ask you a few questions you ready so tell us a little bit of history of Vinny's pizzeria I'm sure he left no no video been around since 1960 it's been through about five different owners we me and Jacob and another partner Henrik bought it about ten years ago and kind of kept the name Vinny's for a long time a lot of our old recipes but kept a lot of the same stuff like the cheese and sauce recipe that's been around for so long you know everybody new guinea's are ready just add it to it their chief slice was awesome we just brought into Claire and the specialty is a delicious combination little too old-school to be okay with trying that Hannah so we have 2% piece of like black bean avocado or mac and cheese bacon how many calories right now okay so it's basically three separate prize cost is about $40 and how long would you say roughly maybe eight partakes to me people add to it start making a specialty so usually and it gets really busy it's three different pizza pies and hey usually to yourself I'd say 45 minutes children but on busy nights definitely an hour it's gotta be pretty pretty heavy like have you have anyone has anyone ordered it to go or is it pretty easy to like package it up and so right and it was me just kind of as like a you know a funny thing but people wanted to want to deliver to their house and we got to make sure that it's sanitary is so oftentimes we can wrap it in foil and plastic wrap you know so that nobody's touching it you know unless you ordered it or no touching anybody's car or anything you know it's staying very sanitary so what do you think's next what do you think is your next reiation stay tuned we got it thank you but do you find you're kind of always like experimenting or just trying to try new things out there daily has a different special responsibility to come in every morning with a new idea and something to do each day that guy he's got probably 300 special boards that he's done he's a little more creative some things you know we have two stores and then each store there's two different specials at each main switch every day how's it looking take a peek yeah that's the inside pie I'm also going

load a slice that my other partner Heather came up with and if you've ever been to a nice Mexican restaurant where you get a side of a load a it's like a mayo based corn with cilantro and cayenne and it's amazing but on a slice of pizza it's even better we also do one in Greenpoint Greenpoint is very heavily polish we do a pierogi slice every Friday there and one of my tops pierogi caramelized onions cheddar cheese sour cream and it's served to the side of apple sauce and the apple sauce just makes it it's amazing that was one of the creations that I was actually a part of I made up one of
