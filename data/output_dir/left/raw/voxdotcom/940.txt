1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,380
When you look at the world's population
density map, you might notice a trend.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,400
40% of the world's population lives within 100 kilometers of a coast.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,040
Most of those people

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,230
are living in and around large
cities and these dense urban areas are

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,960
growing.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,260
That growth calls for more
manufacturing, transportation, power plants,

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,120
and electrical grids.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,599
Resources like this are often placed in cheaper,

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,640
low elevation land. Which means that for
many coastal communities, sea level rise

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,120
caused by climate change isn't just a
problem for the future.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,140
It's a problem

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,060
right now.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,500
One of these places is the New
Jersey Meadowlands.

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,940
It's a 30 mile

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,940
stretch of small towns built on
marshlands.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,740
As the land here sinks and sea

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,840
levels rise, some communities will begin
to flood.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,620
Once impacts become noticeable

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,830
such as water on low-lying streets, water
coming in below seawalls.

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,750
Once that becomes noticeable and
problematic it's going to become chronic

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,180
rather quickly.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,180
So how do we know that
sea level is rising?

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,620
Oxon isotopes.

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,660
The Gulf Stream.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,600
Bathemetry.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,540
We have several sources of evidence.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,880
Scientists like these guys use a variety
of records to study sea-level change.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,860
The longest record where people have been
observing sea-level rise directly is

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,500
with instruments called "tide gauges."

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,700
These instruments measure the level of water

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,120
as it goes up and down with the tide.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,310
Using these gauges alongside geological

33
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,509
records and satellites, scientists have
recorded an acceleration in sea level

34
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,540
which they expect to continue through
this century.

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,490
Between 2000 and 2050 we're

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,860
probably looking at a range here in New
Jersey of about 1 to 2 feet of sea level rise.

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,340
It's going to impact low-lying
infrastructure in particular.

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,060
Imagine if

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,390
you're on a train and you had to wait for
high tide to go out before the train

40
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,300
could go through

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,780
and what a disruption
to the system that would be.

42
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,080
And then multiply that
by every other train line or roadway

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,560
that goes at sea level.

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,760
The Meadowlands is six miles away from

45
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,560
New York City's Times Square.

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,800
It's one of the
busiest transit corridors in the United States.

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,460
If you draw a line from
Philadelphia to New York City and/or

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,740
Philadelphia to Boston, you basically
have to go through the Meadowlands.

49
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,430
So as a result, all of the infrastructure that
connects this region together

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,880
bottlenecks down, comes together in the
Meadowlands.

51
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,100
By year 2050 researchers

52
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,700
estimate that 115 rail stations here
would flood on a chronic basis.

53
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,560
And by that time

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,120
nearly 60% of the region's
current power generating capacity would

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,617
be in a floodplain.

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,020
If you think back to
Superstorm Sandy and one of the

57
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,840
iconic images of that storm was all of
lower Manhattan in darkness.

58
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,720
It's not

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,730
just an inconvenience in a home losing
power, we could shut down the entire

60
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,180
Northeast if we lost power.

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,430
Hurricane Sandy was and is a historic storm.

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,090
Scientists recorded tides up to 20 feet
higher than usual along the New Jersey

63
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,560
and New York coastlines.

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,600
It was the second costliest storm on

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,380
record in the United States and the
tunnels that carry hundreds of thousands

66
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,260
of commuters every day still need repair.

67
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,940
But with a rising sea level flooding

68
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,090
will get worse during weather events
that aren't nearly as extreme as

69
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,220
Hurricane Sandy.

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,800
The simple thing to
understand is that with a higher sea

71
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,530
level it requires less of a storm to
produce the same amount of flooding and

72
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,740
the same storm will produce more
flooding.

73
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,420
And in other parts of New Jersey

74
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,560
there have been documented
nuisance flooding events.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,980
Those can happen even when it doesn't rain.
Oftentimes the water will come from the

76
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,800
ocean or river spilling its banks.

77
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,730
Not so much rainfall flooding. On America's

78
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,620
eastern coast tides cycle four times a
day from high to low to high to low, but

79
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,420
at certain points of the year they can
rise much higher than usual.

80
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,060
We're at a

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,488
point now with continued sea level rise,
that the high tides of the year often

82
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,059
times called king tides with maybe a
little extra wind behind them, they

83
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,480
become a problem and actually start to flood communities.

84
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,790
According to NOAA, the annual

85
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,450
number of high tide flood days is
projected to increase fastest in

86
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,460
New York City. And in a few decades, coastal
cities on the Atlantic could experience

87
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,360
high tide flooding as often as three
times a week.

88
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,400
Storm flooding like what

89
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,920
Hurricane Sandy brought, could become
more persistent very soon.

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,620
By the end of

91
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,560
the century, many towns in New Jersey
would find themselves underwater

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,180
frequently. Including this town in the
heart of the Meadowlands.

93
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,240
One report

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,320
suggested it would lose all of its
housing to chronic flooding.

95
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,160
The response

96
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,190
to sea level rise
boils down to three options: prevention

97
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,700
is basically building higher sea walls.

98
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,960
Things like berms.

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,720
Adaptation is elevation.

100
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,770
Some critical infrastructure
can't relocate for economic reasons, so

101
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,340
it would just end up being cheaper to
raise them.

102
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,400
Retreat is basically

103
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,320
returning the land to nature, but the
state of New Jersey doesn't seem keen on that.

104
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,960
In the last decade, a new NFL
stadium was built alongside large swaths

105
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,600
of new housing and there's an airport
expansion plan.

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,590
But all of that new

107
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,200
concrete could increase flooding from
storm water runoff.

108
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,210
The Meadowlands is

109
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,010
one of the biggest sponges in our region.
If we get rid of those wetlands or if we

110
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,420
you know pave them over, we're going to
be pushing water into other places.

111
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,780
It's very hard to find any community
that's looking at sea-level rise as a

112
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,800
threat that they're planning for today.

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,810
Even if this is something that's 20

114
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,180
years away or so, the decisions we make
today last into those 20 years and beyond

115
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,800
and we need to be doing more to prepare
for those.

116
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,660
Sea level rise impacts are

117
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,220
happening now.

118
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,120
We're seeing them in the
East Coast in terms of increased number

119
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,760
of these sunny day flooding events.

120
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,440
As sea levels continue to rise impacts

121
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,310
and become deeper, more severe, more
widespread and we're going to have to

122
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,600
come to grips with the fact that the way
that we live our lives today is not

123
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,420
going to be the way that we live our
lives in the future.

124
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,700
