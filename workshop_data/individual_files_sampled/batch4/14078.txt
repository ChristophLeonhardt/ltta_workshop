Hollywood continues to devolve into Halle wicked Kevin Spacey is the latest Tinseltown Titan accused of inappropriate sexual conduct but in embracing a very dubious damage control strategy did the house of cards star make things even worse for himself and for that matter the gay community so a list thespian Kevin Spacey says he's beyond horrified by allegations that he made sexual advances on a team boy decades ago now as the story goes Spacey hosted a party in 1986 and got very drunk that's when he allegedly made sexual advances on Anthony Rapp currently a cast member in Star Trek Discovery Rob says Spacey picked him up put him on a bed and got on top of him holding him down tightly holy Harvey Weinstein Batman however rap was somehow able to escape although I have to ask and I'm not blaming the victim here but what was a 14 year old doing at such a party in the first place in any event for his part Spacey state said he can't remember this encounter with rap Spacey then goes on to say if it did indeed happen he√µs rap quote the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior end quote now maybe Spacey was indeed too drunk to remember the incident or maybe he's just saying this in order to come up with an excuse for his behavior ie it was the booze that made him act this way who knows making this pronouncement is already a somewhat questionable crisis management strategy to begin with but did Spacey only further screw things up with the follow-up statement namely soon after offering his Mia culpa Spacey somehow thought that this was the perfect time to come out of the closet here's what he stated on Twitter quote as those closest to me know in my life I have had relationships with both men and woman I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life and I choose now to live as a gay man end quote he Heights in trying to they regret and remorse over the alleged sexual assault waving the rainbow flag is surely a huge strategical error for Spacey because in the final analysis what a sexual orientation have to do with sexual assault or for that matter inappropriate sexual advances on a fourteen-year-old boy the answer of course is nothing so why in the world would Spacey conflate these two issues to begin with how could he possibly think that coming out at this particular moment would make things better for him or did he think that playing the gay card would lead to a get out of jail free card for him regardless there are many in the gay community who are none too pleased with Spacey's mixed message and rightly so here's a sampling of tweets regarding a law fair Spacey from Richard Lawson coming out as a gay man is not the same thing as coming out as someone who preyed on a fourteen-year-old conflating those things is disgusting and from Louise Brealey Spacey trying to hide behind coming out and offering drunkenness for an excuse for jumping on a child shows his breathtaking arrogance and finally from Moshe kasher ashamed of being accused of bank robbery I forgot if I did that but this is a good time to let you know I am Jewish in one respect it's a shame really I always been a Kevin Spacey fan he's one of the best actors on the planet so in this regard is this the latest case in which one must employ that old chestnut about separating the artist from his art as well will this be a matter of things healing with the passage of time I mean just consider what transpired at the Oscars back in 2003 a Oscar goes to Roman Polanski the Academy congratulate roman polanski and accepts his award on his behalf gee too bad Han Solo didn't have time to say why mr. Polanski couldn't be in attendance at night namely that there's an international warrant out for Polanski due to his drugging and raping a 13 year old girl some 40 years ago and yet as you saw there was the who's who of Hollywood back in oh three applauding plants keep some even giving this predator a standing ovation Whoopi Goldberg would go on to a pine that what Polanski did was not rape rape another Hollywood bigwig said the Polanski incident was a quote so-called crime end quote oh by the way the person who uttered that pithy quotation none other than Harvey Weinstein so why the apparent double standard here Polanski is celebrated even though he actually raped the girl spacy meanwhile is being pilloried is Spacey's true crime due to his intentional albeit inexplicable muddying of the waters by apologizing for an act of assault while in the same sentence announcing that he's gay or post weinstein allegations have things changed in Hollyweird now one must wonder when the next Kevin Spacey sincere apology will be uttered and one must also wonder if like Roman Polanski that eventually Tinseltown will with the passage of time choose to forget and forgive Spacey's indiscretions as well hey what was the name of that movie starring that other Polanski a list apologist Meryl Streep oh yeah it's complicated for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has an all-new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
