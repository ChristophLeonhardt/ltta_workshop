it's never okay to send death threats to
someone never ever ever okay but what if
they insult my favorite band it's never
okay on my favorite book series No or if
they make fun of the way I look not even
then or okay if they say something
offensive about like my religion or my
race it is never okay but hypothetically
speaking let's say oh my god they're
really famous it's still not okay and
they have a huge security detail do I
have to spell it out and like skywriting
or pink glitter or something and all the
people making those threats and like
saying those things casually I like 12
okay i'm going to try something new here
is a list of occasions when it is
acceptable to make death threats
it is never okay to make death threats
okay adios
