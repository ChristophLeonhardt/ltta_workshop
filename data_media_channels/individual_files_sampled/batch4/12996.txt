so there was a royal wedding over the weekend I don't know if you heard about it it was kind of an intimate affair they were making a big deal about it you know just invited a few of their close family members so maybe didn't hear about it but and look I don't want to get into a whole thing a whole rant about what's the point of the royal family it's so stupid I'm not gonna get into that because although I don't care about the royal family I do appreciate in principle I appreciate the idea of countries preserving their traditions I'm a fan of that now this this tradition has turned into a bit of a soap opera too much for my taste but you know whatever I'm fine with that in any way the Brits can do what they want and if they want to spend money on keeping the royal family together then hey that's that's on them well what I wanted to talk about was jumping off using as a jumping-off point a tweet that was sent out by a Twitter user by the name of Yvan over the weekend and she was commemorating this special occasion of the Royal Wedding by celebrating divorce and what Yvan said was all my females if Meagan never left her first marriage she wouldn't be pretty princess today there is always better there is always better isn't that just a great way to go into a marriage till death do we part unless something better comes along in which case I'm out of here sorry chump I'm gone now this declaration wouldn't be notable except for the fact that it has received last I checked over 300,000 likes and something like 80 or 90 thousand retweets so obviously this marriage advice which happens to be the worst marriage advice ever recorded in human history resonated with a lot of people in our culture and so I think it's worth addressing and fortunately I think that the bright side is that it also provides a valuable opportunity for all the single men of America what you can do if you're a single man or if you're dating if you're good discerning marriage and if you're with a woman before you propose what you could do is what I would recommend if she's on Twitter go on Twitter and scroll through and see if she ever liked or retweeted or expressed any endorsement whatsoever of that tweet because a lot of women in America in America did and if you see that they're just run the other way as fast as you can just run I'm talking about even if you were like sitting at dinner and and this will be rude to do but if you happen to check your her Twitter while you're sitting at dinner with her and you saw that then just get up from the dinner table and run just run out of the run out of the restaurant don't even say goodbye I'm out of here because any woman who takes that view of marriage is not suited for marriage and is not suited for adulthood is not suited for human relationships in general okay that's someone who just is I mean that is selfishness and immaturity on a scale unimaginable okay anyone who takes that view stay away from now it should be noted that Megan Markel and I did look this up for some reason well because I was I knew I was gonna talk about it so I felt like I needed to Megan Markel did she is divorced and according to a book that's being written about her and interviews with people familiar with the situation she abandoned her husband just left her husband one day out of the blue and blindsided him he didn't see it coming she just left him and I guess they were when she decided this they were in different parts of the country she mailed him back her wedding ring and just left them couple years later she finds a richer and more famous guy and decides to marry him and were told that when it went out when I've asked women like why do you care about the royal wedding what I've been told is well it's like a fairy tale it's a fairy tale romance is it really because in order for this fairy tale romance to happen another marriage had to be destroyed and a man had to be abandoned and the vows that she made to him she had to break so she broke those vows and then she found this other guy that's a fairy tale now that's not the kind of fairy tales I'm familiar with and sadly considering the rate of divorce for second marriages is around 60% chances are this will not be the last stop in her marital tour and when you get to third marriages the rate of divorce is like 75% and I wish her no ill-will but the point is you know it's not hard to see why divorced people tend to keep on getting divorced there's this domino effect of divorce that happens it's not hard to see why because marriage there's only two ways of looking at marriage either it's a lifelong unbreakable covenant or it's not and if you've already been divorced and you're getting married again well clearly you think it's not and you're taking that attitude with you into your next marriage which is not a good way to start another way to frame it is like this for Christians another the best way to frame it is we're talking about marriage Jesus either defined marriage correctly or he didn't and as it happens many churches in America believe that he did and they teach that he didn't well he didn't know what he was talking about I guess which is why they allow which is why in so many churches they allow for their members to get up on the altar and make an undying until death do we part commitment to a person and then come back a few years later and make it to another person and then another person and another person even while the people they're divorcing are still alive so until death do we part yeah maybe not that's what many churches in America that's what they've turned the marriage vows into they've turned it into until death do we part yeah you know maybe that should be officially incorporated into the marriage ceremony is just like this this motion you know it's like yeah yeah we'll see we'll see that's what the church says and in these churches let's understand what's happening here in these churches polygamy is completely permissible because this is polygamy according to Jesus this is polygamy you're still married to that other person the bond is still there you marry another person now you've tried to marry two people that's polygamy it's just that now we allow polygamy in succession rather than all at once but a man who marries five different women is a polygamist whether he marries them one at a time at all or all at once doesn't matter it's the same thing but if marriage is not a lifelong covenant which I guess most Christians these days think it isn't then what is it and what purpose does it serve why bother with it what if it's not permanent and if you don't really mean it when you say when you vow your undying commitment and loyalty to a person why do it I understand the legal benefits but in the tax benefits let's put that aside for a moment spiritually what's the point of the exercise it has been drained of its meaning and its purpose in that case and then all it is all marriages in that case is just another thing you do hoping it'll make you happy and if it doesn't make you happy and inevitably there will come a time when you're not happy at least for a season that's what happens in most marriages you know it is not going to be a state of unbroken euphoria all the time there's going to be unhappiness there's going to be oh you know anger there's gonna be all kinds of thing so if you go into it thinking I'm doing this to make me happy and then you're not happy then you just you kind of trade the marriage in like an unsatisfying dish at a restaurant you say well this this displeases me waiter take this away and brick yeah bring me that over there bring me that on the menu let me try that one instead this is why I always say that most churches in America gave up on marriage destroyed it really long before the homosexuals came knocking you know long before there was any gay marriage fight the churches had already abdicated they had already given up when it comes to marriage by giving their blessings to rampant divorce and remarriage they had already removed from marriage its entire point and that point again is to be a spiritual and unbreakable spiritual bond between man and wife a bond that brings them closer to God and which serves as the foundation for the family and when that bond is broken then the to fall away not only from each other but from God and the foundation which was which was formed now cracks and the children who were supposed to be sheltered by and given security by this foundation are now buried under its rubble that's what happens and when I say the bond is broken you know that's not exactly the right way of putting it I guess because according to the Christian understanding according to Jesus the bond cannot be broken it is unbreakable Jesus says this very clearly in Matthew when he's asked about it by the Pharisees he says haven't you read at the beginning the creator made the male and female for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh what God has joined together let no one separate they are no longer two but one he either means that or he doesn't it's either true or it isn't in in marriage we either become one with our spouses or we don't and if we do that we must remain one no matter what that's why Jesus says you can't get remarried because you're still married to the other person that bond is still there that's the whole beauty and and in miracle and power of marriage is that it is a it's a sacrament bestowed on one spouse to the other and vice versa and that and then it is it is it is sealed by God but the point is that in a marriage ceremony something real is actually happening there's a real thing taking place a supernatural event you are witnessing a supernatural event you are witnessing two souls come together and be to be bound together for life it's a miracle and this is the problem with all the Christians today who you know they see everything is symbolic and nothing is sacramental and so they've lost so they don't even understand the if they've taken the significance and the beauty and the depth out of everything and everything now is just it's just a charade it's a pageant it's just words that you say nothing has any meaning but that's not how it's supposed to be that's not what Jesus is saying he's saying marriage has meaning something is happening you are doing something here something serious and real is happening and you can't undo it it's done just like that of course people people are familiar with the Bible will observe that Jesus allows for an exception supposedly and in Matthew he does say he says everyone who divorces his wife except on grounds of unchastity which is variously interns lated as sexual immorality adultery so everyone who divorces his wife except on those grounds makes her commit adultery now Matthew is the only place in the New Testament where you find this exception problem is that the passages in mark and in Luke they don't contain this exception they also record Jesus talking about the indissoluble indissolubility of marriage how it's an unbreakable covenant they don't include any exception whatsoever and then st. Paul he discusses marriage he talks about divorce but he but he includes no exception he says don't get divorced so what's happened though is a lot of churches and this this process really started long before this but in many churches it really began to take hold in the early 20th century where they latched on to this exception and they just are clinging to it now desperately and wringing it dry of every possibility and this little a quote-unquote exception has been used and taken and just it has destroyed the marital covenant in America which is an Internet you know it's an interesting thing when um and you find this in the Bible you know the different gospel accounts a little bit different and but when you find something like this where Jesus says it only in one gospel and in none of the others and so you you know in a sense you almost have to choose which one are you going to take to heart and it's interesting that so many Christians have I mean it's interesting they chose that's the one they could take mark and Luke's interpretation but no they say well no that's not exactly now I'm going to take this one this is the one I like now but it is there so we have to deal with it right I mean we can't just write it off and so what what is it what does it mean and and why does it appear only in one gospel and think about the gospel that it appears him matthew is a gospel that was written specially for a Jewish audience and even in that passage Jesus is talking to a Jewish audience he's talking to the Pharisees so it's Jesus talking to a Jewish audience in a gospel written specially for a Jewish audience and for some reason this one interesting mysterious vague exception appears only in that context and nowhere else why is that well it seems to me that the idea that this is really just a broad sweeping exception allowing for a divorce negating jesus's own teaching on marriage allowing for divorce in any case of unchastity or adultery well that just doesn't hold it just doesn't make sense it doesn't it doesn't work with everything else in the New Testament it doesn't work with Jesus's own words even in the context of that passage where he says man and wife become one flesh and for him to immediately a sentence later say well but maybe not that doesn't work um it also doesn't work because there's there's debate about what exactly how do you interpret that I mean what is the Dolce what does mean well Jesus also defines adultery in Matthew by saying if you look at a woman lustfully then you have committed adultery and so if we're really gonna take that exception to heart well that means that if a man so much as looks at a woman that's grounds for divorce you're done right I mean you're sitting on a park bench with your wife a woman walks by you look at her you can get divorced that's it she can leave because Jesus says that's adultery in your heart and and Jesus is being serious about that I mean we have to take him literate we'd take him at his word but if you lust after a woman even for a moment in your heart in your head then you have committed adultery but you take that and you apply it to what he's saying here at least the way people interpret it then it would seem like well you could basically get that that means that basically every marriage in America can be broken you could get out because adultery in the heart is is sadly at an extremely common thing in in marriages just in America but throughout human history right so you know that that also doesn't work he goes that would mean that he goes from saying marriage is a union you know man and woman they come together let no man separate and then and then a couple sentences later he's saying well but actually every marriage can be dissolved no doesn't make sense but that's how it's been interpreted so how can we understand it well a few different theories one theory is that Matthew put that in there as a means of avoiding the whole subject of adultery because he didn't want to alienate his Jewish audience and so he kind of just punted on it and he put that in there which is possible look the got the Gospel writers they all you know they they all kind of take from their perspective in the audience they're talking to they frame things different it's like for instance you know most biblical scholars agree that the Sermon on the Mount which appears in at least the the expanded version the Director's Cut version that appears in Matthew it's much longer than it appears elsewhere because Matthew has taken teachings that Jesus said at other points and he's kind of put them all together into this one cohesive unit it doesn't mean that Jesus actually said all that right that he did say it all but most people to scholars think he didn't say it right then he said it at various point because then other gospel comes other some teachings from the Sermon on the Mount they appeared in the Sermon on the Mount for for Matthew but then other Gospels they appear elsewhere so how do you make sense of it you know it's because the Gospel writers you know have their own ways of kind of presenting things so that's possible another is that Jesus is that this is just a matter of wording and that what Jesus is saying is that anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery unless she's already committed adultery in whiskey in which case he hasn't caused it because she already committed but I think the most logical theory and the one that makes sense of everything is that Matthew is speaking to people who do marriage differently from the rest of the world and from the way that we do it now and in Jewish custom at the time there was a marriage there was a legal marriage and then there was a period of some time before the marriage was consummated and that is made complete made full through sexual relations with husband and wife and there was this what this is called the betrothal period where there's a legal marriage but the marriage is not complete yet it isn't it has not come into its fullness yet the Jewish custom so it would make sense that Jesus is speaking to and Matthew is speaking to people who take part in that custom and what he's saying is if you commit adultery during that period before you've consummated with your husband or with your wife then the marriage is dissolved and it wouldn't even really be divorced in that case it is legally it's divorced but the point is the marriage was never complete now there's precedent for this remember that this is what G this was what Joseph was going to do with Mary originally before he came to understand or at least in some way came to understand what was really going on but no he was married to her but as he said he he had not had relations with her yet he had not consummated the marriage so when he thought for that moment that she had been unfaithful he was going to divorce her quietly too so as to preserve her dignity but the point is he was going to divorce because if she had been unfaithful then that means the marriage is dissolved anyway so you know it would seem that those theories make a heck of a lot more sense than the idea that Jesus allowed for an exception that could apply to almost all marriages right after he just said that marriages are a bond eternally between man and wife and no man can separate it you know that to me doesn't make any sense especially wouldn't make any sense that this exception this glaring huge enormous pivotal exception would only appear vaguely and confusingly in one gospel and nowhere else I think that in in modern America we have in not just in America but in modern society we have decided to interpret it that way because that's how we want it to be you know I've always been someone who was encouraged marriage I've always been a proponent of marriage but I think I need to add a disclaimer to that you know you you shouldn't be afraid to marry and I always say that I always say to two people in my generation don't be afraid of marriage you know you should you should get married if you want to don't be afraid of it but clamor is you shouldn't be afraid to marry as long as the person you're marrying has ruled out divorce as an option to start with because if the if they cannot look you in the eyes and tell you I will not leave you if they cannot say that bill Merriam and not only should you not marry them it's not even just like you shouldn't marry them it's also that you can't marry them literally you you literally cannot marry them because in a now you could go you could have the ceremony and you could say the vows you could have the reception you have the honeymoon but if a person while they're saying the vows if they don't fully mean it and if the in the back of their head if they're thinking yeah you know I could leave if this thing goes sideways if in their head they're thinking well this is not necessarily lifelong let's see how it goes if they've got somewhere in their mind kind of an escape plan in mind then it's not a marriage the marriage wasn't thought it wasn't valid it didn't take place because marriage requires full consent of the will it requires that both as I said it's a sacrament bestowed on one spouse to the other and if one of them isn't taking part in that stowing in that bestowing process if they are not bestowing their undying commitment on the other well then there's no marriage there's a disconnect there you know it's it's it's the marriage is when the two come together and connect but when the one is not taking part and there can't be a marriage that's literally that's what the vow is that's what it's all about that's why you say the Val it's when you say to the other person I will not leave you this is until death do we part that's why we say it and if somebody won't say it or if they will say it but they refuse to mean it then there can't there can there literally cannot be a marriage you um and so I think probably in America today there are a lot of invalid marriages that because there are a lot of people who go into marriage not really intending necessarily to stay in it they go into the marriage with this basically the same internal commitment as you know as as they had before the marriage which is a yeah I'm committed to you for now I love you for now but I'm not promising necessarily to always love you I may say that I promise you but I don't really think about prenuptial agreements there is prenups I mean I don't see how a marriage can be valid if there's a prenup because that means that what what what you're saying is here's my escape plan here's my escape strategy yeah I hope this works out but I mean maybe it won't and if it doesn't then here's my here's my plan B well then that means it's not till death do we part means you're not serious it's not a marriage thought a marriage is might be a legal marriage but it's not really amiss spiritually it's not a marriage what marriage is supposed to be that's where you find the security and the whole point in everything in marriage you find it when you can look at the other person and you know that there's this commitment and you will never leave them that you're in it always that's why I thought you know that's why I it's one of the many reasons why I ice so much prefer being married you know III enjoy marriage so much more than I ever did it's like the whole you know dating and everything one of the many many reasons is that is is that security that you have that kind of emotional spiritual security and knowing that you know even if there's hard times even if mistakes are made even if there are times of unhappiness and anger and everything even if those times are numerous and even if you go through a really rough patch you know that you're in it you're not going to leave because you made that commitment and you're bound to it and by it and through it to not have that in a marriage as a scary thing and scary most of all because then it's not really a marriage everything I'm saying here is just really basic biblical you know I'm just I'm being redundant and like plagiarizing the Bible everything I'm saying is just right from the Bible but and that's what makes it so sad and and and shameful really that many Christians will never hear anything like this in their churches and so the marital institution is just collapsing all around us and most churches and most Christian leaders refuse to say anything about it because their couch Jesus was not a coward which is why he spoke to this issue directly multiple times and what he said was clear and so I think we need to go back to that thanks for watching thanks for listening everybody Godspeed you
