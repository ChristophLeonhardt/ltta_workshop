and so you see this this element of hope in his early photos right and then he begins to come across things like this a mother talks about the work of her son these pictures were taken by freelance journalists Austin Tice shortly before he was abducted by armed men at a roadblock near Damascus six years ago and it was Austin's deepest desire that they could have reformed without any of these photos ever being taken and so I just want you to join him behind the camera I want you two to get a feeling for his heart of why it could be so why did Austin go there he just wanted to tell this story that was so young when he arrived the FBI has posted a 1 million dollar reward for information leading to the safe location recovery and return of Austin Tice renewing hopes that he's still alive let's believe that more than 30 abducted journalists are being held in Syria but the exact figure is impossible to ascertain in many cases the abduction is not publicized pending negotiations for release what is known is that the kidnapped journalists come from a number of countries among them France Spain Lebanon Mauritania Jordan and United States one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in the world and so events like these that raise awareness on situation in that country and the journalists who risk their lives to cover that conflict for the American public for the international community as well that's really a vital importance and in this room the awareness - there are many other fathers and mothers in Syria and beyond still hoping for the safe return of their loved ones Mike Anna al-jazeera Washington
