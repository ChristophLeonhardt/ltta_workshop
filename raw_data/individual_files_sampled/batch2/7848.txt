absolute trash the environment and your bodies yesterday we talked about how they're trying to lower the standards for protecting you from radiation saying that hey maybe some radiation will be good for you that's actually something they said their proposals so far would give new life to aging coal plants allow and gas operations to release more methane into the atmosphere prevent new cuts curbs on greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air conditioning units the vehicle rule alone that they're arguing for would put 8 billion additional tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere this century more than a year's worth of total u.s. emissions and again this is the numbers that they're providing so I want to focus on one number in particular and what they said is I believe it's 709 parts per million in the atmosphere of carbon that is what they're saying we are on path to have by 2100 as they're arguing for more emissions by the way let's bring up this chart you've probably seen this before and things like An Inconvenient Truth it's showing over time over hundreds of thousands of years the parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and you see there jumping up again they'd like to say that this is just natural variation and things like that but that huge increase that was so big they made documentaries about it you realize that that's like 380 they say we're gonna hit 709 which for comparison's sake you couldn't fit on this chart and that is what they're saying you know what screw it we're not even gonna try to stop it why don't we just you'll burn the oil burn the gas Dan you know damn the torpedoes we're gonna have whatever cars we want it doesn't matter if your refrigerator is inefficient it doesn't matter we don't care we're not going to do anything about it that was one of the things that we warned about before getting the Trump administration hopefully we can gain a little bit of control over these processes in these midterms and do something actually to not just stop it reverse it in the next presidential election 2020 absolute devastation it's so nice when you can get a silver lining out of saying that we're gonna end up in a Mad Max movie but that's ridiculous their their argument there are logical argument is that it's so bad we shouldn't try it right it's gonna happen anyway it's supposed to happen we're still not saying coin change is a thing we're saying this is something else called something else that's just supposed to happen yeah and there's a bunch of videos at TYT will be has already started releasing John did one I did one Jake did one that's out now it's part of the membership drive and it goes through the progressive platform issue-by-issue the one that john did on climate change is essentially about how you know since citizens united the entire Republican Party has changed their tune on climate change and it's based on who's been able to fund what they used to say climate change existed and it was and the money you know the climate change existed people were behind it and then the Koch brothers like no no we need to fund our pipelines yeah now this is another weird way to pervert science in a way that benefits them but doesn't even make internal logic sense if you're gonna piss on my leg and call it rain at least like have both those things be liquid yeah this is just something that doesn't even hold together they're throwing rocks in your face and saying it's rain and saying it's your and what yes yeah it does come down to funding they have been funding Republican senators and congressmen to trash the environment and that's been working we have to do the opposite you have to make clear that this is something you will vote based on and hopefully also continue the push to get people to accept that climate change is actually happening and it's something we should do something about that involves supporting politicians that also involves supporting media outlets that are going to talk about things like climate change we have made a commitment to do as much of that as possible not just on The Young Turks but on my program the damage report you could help to support us by becoming a member tea or tea calm slash join the mainstream media only rarely talks about climate change they have no particular expertise over and they certainly don't prioritize it support media that will actually give a damn about the biggest threat facing our civilization and our world thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a TYT member today for more exclusive content join now at TYT dot-com /join
