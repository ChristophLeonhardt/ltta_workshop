1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,240
In Russia,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,860
36,000 women are beaten by their partners
every day.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,040
One woman dies from domestic violence

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,800
every 40 minutes.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,020
Abusers have enjoyed impunity in Russia for years.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,460
Beating up a family member only
became a crime there in July 2016,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,140
when President Vladimir Putin introduced the
concept of domestic abuse into the criminal code.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,580
But that law was only in place for seven months.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,700
Isobel Yeung traveled to Russia to understand
the country’s rejection of women’s rights.

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,500
— Why is that? What happened here?

11
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,420
— Gulnara Orlova was abused
by her ex-husband for 20 years.

12
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,380
— She has a pin in her shoulder,

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,000
a metal plate in her knee,

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,980
and a broken bone in her skull
that caused brain damage

15
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,200
and left her deaf in one ear.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Her husband once hacked her with an axe.

17
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,800
— So even with that solid evidence,
the authorities still did nothing.

18
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,560
— Russian authorities dismissed Gulnara’s complaints,

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,400
saying there were no other witnesses.

20
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,600
— Did you ever fear for your daughter’s life?

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,320
— Stories like Gulnara’s led Vladimir Putin

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,080
to criminalize domestic violence in July 2016.

23
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,060
Under those laws,

24
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,120
beatings by relatives were punishable
by up to 360 hours of community service,

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,640
a year of forced labor,

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,240
or up to two years in prison.

27
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,140
But that didn’t last long.

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,600
This February, just seven months
after those laws had been set,

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,980
the government softened
their stance on domestic abuse.

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,580
First-time offenders, or those involved
in non-life-threatening beatings,

31
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,260
will now spend 15 days in jail,

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,280
complete just 120 hours of community service,

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,840
or pay a fine of 30,000 rubles—

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,900
the equivalent of $500.

35
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,000
— Vitaly Milonov is one of the politicians
behind this latest decriminalization.

36
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,280
— I mean, this move to decriminalize has
been widely condemned internationally

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,500
as step back on Russia’s human rights.

38
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,100
— I mean, how is that not counter-progressive?

39
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,700
— Okay.

40
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,360
The politician Yevgeny Roizman has said
that there has been a sharp increase

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,500
in domestic violence cases
since this decriminalization.

42
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,500
— Do you think that the increase
of domestic violence

43
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,100
is something that you’re willing
to risk with this decriminalization?

44
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,740
— Mari Davtyan is one of the lawyers
who drafted the law against family violence

45
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,620
that Putin passed last year.

46
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,880
She says that Russia has always
struggled with domestic abuse,

47
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,480
and that even for the short period
the criminalization law was in effect,

48
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,100
it was rarely applied.

49
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,000
— What  was the worst thing that he did to you?

50
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,520
— Gulnara’s ex-husband was sent
to prison in December 2015,

51
00:06:09,530 --> 00:00:00,000
after he beat a neighbor to death
over his lost phone.
