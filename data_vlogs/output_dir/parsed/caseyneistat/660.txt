hi today's vlog was shot in its entirety
on the new iPhone 6s in 4k resolution so
be sure to click here and then click
here to see what it looks like at its
best every shot is in 4k shot on the
iPhone including this time-lapse so
we're headed to midtown now for no
reason than to like take pictures of
something different I don't know we've
drawn a skateboard and here's Marlon
Marlon we're testing out the new iPhone
this is the brand new one
I would be in so much trouble if
somebody stole that's like pre-release
iPhone 6s we got to be
so many camera tests are up like perfect
lighting conditions and this is not that
horrible clicking sound is like some
nonsense happening with whatever's going
on over there for our next real world
camera test I'm going to use my
you stick like this I'm not actually
going to take pictures and Jack's going
to film me while I take selfie pictures
with some of the street performers I
just want to say as a disclaimer I
highly recommend you do not solicit he's
like costume street performers I'm just
doing it because I don't know it seemed
like a funny idea right yeah oh yeah
okay ready hi can I have a photo
how did you looking for Kate yeah that's
amazing pistol clear
it's like being on a strip club okay
who's next
in that situation I'm like this week
before work
the weirdest isn't it weird as they are
done in New York City
and then you got it okay one more
no okay okay thank you girls here's some
here's some dollars
I was extremely uncomfortable I could
say for the record I don't know that
I've ever really been to a strip club
but I now have blue paint on me
who's next Elmo the plan was that I get
my picture taken with every one of these
three performers but I panic around
those girls so I just wanted it to end
and I gave them all of our tipping money
let's get out of let's get out of here
man this is freaking me out look at this
woman
in conclusion pretty impressive stuff
especially crazy when you think like
this was my first vlogging camera this
was I literally used to vlog like this
back in the day this has 400 lines of
resolution that cellphone has 4,000
couple caveats I really don't like how
narrow the lenses on an iPhone on this
thing I use that this is like a
wide-angle adapter it's made by a
company called moment this is what they
look like they make really good stuff it
changes your relationship with the phone
I also put a microphone on there because
if you're gonna use this as like a
camera you need better sound other than
that nice work Apple computers I give
this thing a thumbs up hey Tony you
should follow me on beam at beam Tony so
much cool stuff in my life I just want
to share it with you alright
