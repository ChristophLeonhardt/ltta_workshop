when I was born the median price for a house was 108 thousand nine hundred dollars now it's three hundred thirty seven thousand two hundred dollars even if you account for inflation that's about a forty five percent increase in cost but buying a house is something I would like to do so I'm trying to figure out if I can the odds are pretty stacked against me I'm a millennial and I graduated college in 2010 right in the middle of the recession when I entered the workforce the job market was rough like many of my peers I have student loan debt and on top of that there aren't very many starter or mid price homes on the market my personal financial situation has to do with choices I made I changed careers at 27 I took out loans to go back to grad school and I didn't manage to save any money before that but that's not abnormal for someone my age according to a LinkedIn study it's common for Millennials to change jobs about three times in the first five years after college and in the eight years I've been out of college I lived in New York City of the whole time median cost of a home here seven hundred and seventy thousand dollars I certainly can't afford that when I look at my income cost of living and student loan debt the idea of buying something as expensive as a house seems nearly impossible my dream home would look something like this or this but even if my boyfriend and I took our combined income of a hundred thousand dollars a year that apartment is a pipe dream I went to Business Insider's own financial planner Lauren Lyons Cole I figured if anyone could help me it would be her when you're just starting out you can calculate a general price range by taking your annual income and multiplying it by three with a combined income of about $100,000 a year that means a home that costs around three hundred thousand dollars would be a good starting point that's not as bad as I was expecting but I have no idea what I can get for that price with a budget like that in New York City you probably aren't gonna find that many options so you might have to make sacrifices which couldn't even mean relocating to another city but then you have to figure out what kind of job options are there much could you get paid to do the work you want to do you have to think about which amenities you really want and which ones you can do without I've always wanted some kind of outdoor space like maybe a balcony a two-bedroom would be nice big windows maybe a turret what I'm a millennial I'm idealistic once you have an idea of what you can afford and what you're willing to give up you can take the next step and start looking at listings that are available in your price range with the budget Lauren and I came up with I browsed options in a few cities I could see myself living in I wasn't amazed with anything I came across but there were some that were nice not so much in New York especially when I compared it to the apartment I live in now which is below market rent I also checked out Grand Rapids Michigan because it was number one on Business Insider's lists of best housing markets for Millennials there I did find some amazing places within my budget but I can't see myself picking up and moving there right now for me owning a place isn't worth living somewhere where I don't know anyone and I don't have a job lined up so I think for now I'm gonna keep renting and try to save up for a down payment maybe in a few years the price of avocado toast will go down and I'll be able to afford that dream castle maybe a balcony a two-bedroom would be nice big windows maybe a turret
