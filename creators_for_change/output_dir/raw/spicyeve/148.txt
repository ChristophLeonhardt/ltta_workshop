Hey Youtube World! It's me, Evelyn. So many
people ask this question. Like everybody asks

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,579
me this question. A lot of you - a lot of
my subbies ask this question and - I get it

3
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:17,700
everywhere - A LOT. All my subbies... I get
this question a lot. It's like the most asked

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,250
question ever in life of me.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,740
Evelyn - can you share your short, tapered
natural hair routine. Alright, so let's go

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,360
ahead and get into it. *awkward pause*

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,210
Although I must note, it is exactly the same
as my regular natural hair routine - just

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,210
less hair. Like nothing changes. Like nothing's
different. Like I just wash my hair. And I

9
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,780
like, twist it. And it's like the same thing--

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,659
So the way I cleanse my hair, is I wet it.
And then I put shampoo in my hand. And then

11
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:57,989
I put it on my hair. And then I scrub.

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,650
So I suds up! I rinse the shampoo out of my
hair, and then I go into the next step, which

13
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,610
So depending on how I'm feeling, I either
grab a thinner, runnier rinse out conditioner

14
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,670
or I get a thick deep conditioner. It's just
luck of the draw. I apply it to my hair and

15
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,460
I proceed to finger detangle.

16
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,160
I will link my finger detangling video in
the video description box.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Alright!

18
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,000
All I do, with that conditioner still in my
hair, I put on a shower cap, and then I put

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,670
on my heated Hair Therapy Wrap for about 30
minutes. And then I rinse!

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,530
After I've gently dried my hair with a t-shirt
instead of a fuzzy towel, I apply a leave-in

21
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,120
conditioner to my slightly damp hair. And
then, because I'm lazy, I twist it and go

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,580
to bed.

23
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:03,210
Also as part of my laziness, I'll wear snapbacks
the first couple days in the week. Then sometimes

24
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,000
in the middle of the week when I'm feeling
more like a human being. When I'm finally

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,550
ready to style my hair -- I do exactly the
same hairstyle that I've been doing since

26
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,400
2012.

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,440
I apply my styler and first twist the perimeter
layer of my hair. Then I twist the top. You

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,910
can either wind the twist up on itself - some
people call it a hanging bantu knot - or you

29
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,250
can actually use curlers, and wind your hair
around the curler. Either way, when you take

30
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,700
it down, for me it produces the same result
- a TWIST AND CURL.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,980
I let it dry overnight, and then because I'm
lazy and I never wake up early enough to do

32
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,830
my hair, I go to work with that same headscarf
and take down my twists in the office bathroom.

33
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,830
I just grab whatever oil or serum is in the
ladies' bathroom. Drizzle it on my hands,

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,000
fluff, and VOILA!

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:19,200
*awkward poses in silence*

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Hope that answers any questions. My hair routine
has not changed. I just -- *sighs*.

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,110
Yeah, I don't really...ya know?! It's just
- it is what it is. In the comments below,

38
00:03:32,110 --> 00:00:00,000
tell me how long you spend on your hair. And
I will see you on the internet somewhere - BYE!
