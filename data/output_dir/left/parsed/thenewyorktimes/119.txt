These social
media posts belong
to an alleged Russian agent.
She’s Mariia Butina.
The U.S. has charged
her with trying
to influence
American politicians
and political groups to
advance Russian interests.
But she’s no shadowy
foreign agent.
She’s all over social media:
at least 11,000 tweets, 100
YouTube videos, 4,700 Facebook
friends, LinkedIn,
a blog, etc.
Let’s take a closer
look into these accounts
to find out who she is and
how she might have been
trying to wield influence.
This is Butina
during a photo shoot
for GQ Russia in 2014.
She was a well-known gun
rights advocate in Russia.
And her early social feeds
followed her activism.
By 2015, she started posting
from the United States.
These are from a
National Rifle Association
meeting in Nashville.
They were posted on one of her
Russian social media pages.
U.S. court records show
that infiltrating
the N.R.A. was one way
Russia tried to influence
Republican politics.
And Butina fit right in.
Here she is networking
with top N.R.A. officials.
Then there is the
Republican Party.
There’s a few ways
she gets inside:
at a teenage Republican
summer camp in South Dakota;
here she is with Wisconsin
Governor Scott Walker;
in 2015, she asked a question
of then candidate Donald Trump.
“I am visiting from Russia.”
“Ah, Putin. Good friend
of Obama, Putin.
He likes Obama a lot.
Go ahead.”
“My question will be
about foreign politics.”
At a prayer
breakfast in 2017,
she posed with her
alleged handler,
an influential
Russian official now
under U.S. sanction.
And right here is where
President Trump spoke
that same morning.
All the while, Butina
maintained the
image of an active twentysomething.
She studied
international relations
at American University.
She exercised and
took flying lessons.
But now her social
feeds are quiet as she
sits in U.S. custody.
