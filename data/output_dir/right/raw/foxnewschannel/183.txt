TILL THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND

3
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,551
FEARS OF A 2016 REPEAT ARE

4
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:14,554
CREEPING IN FOR DEMOCRATS TO

5
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:16,156
SOME EXTENT, WHILE DEMOCRATIC

6
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:18,358
ENTHUSIASM REMAINS HIGH, THE

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,026
PARTY LEADS IN THE GENERIC

8
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,927
CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT.

9
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:23,730
I THINK AT ABOUT 7%, THE AVERAGE

10
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,365
NUMBER OF THE LEAD FOR THE

11
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,234
DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW, BUT A

12
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,269
RECENT REPORT CAUTIONS NERVOUS

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,738
DEMOCRATS TO WIN ELECTION DAY

14
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:32,606
DISASTER.

15
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:33,473
HERE NOW, BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR

GOOD FOR -- YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING

19
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:42,816
AT THIS VERY CLOSELY THE PAST

20
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:43,717
FEW WEEKS.

21
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:46,753
DO YOU THINK THEIR FEARS ARE

22
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:47,120
JUSTIFIED?

23
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:48,488
>> THERE'S A REASON TO BE AFRAID

24
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:50,123
THAT THERE ARE POLES THAT CAME

25
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:51,058
OUT AND BATTLEGROUND DISTRICTS

26
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,259
DISTRICTS SHOWING REPUBLICANS

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,728
RUNNING EVEN WITH DEMOCRATS

28
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,363
IN A ENORMOUS BATTLEGROUND

29
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:57,464
DISTRICTS, THOSE BEING THE

30
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:58,632
DISTRICT THAT WERE VERY

31
00:00:58,633 --> 00:00:59,166
COMPETITIVE BETWEEN

32
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,701
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

33
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:01,168
HILLARY CLINTON.

34
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:04,338
THE MAP LOOKS, TO ME, AS THOUGH

35
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:05,739
THE RED AREAS ARE GETTING REDDER

36
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,941
AND THE BLUE AREAS ARE GETTING

37
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,709
BLUER, THE PURPLE AREAS ARE

38
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,843
GETTING MORE PURPLE.

39
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:13,080
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A WALK IN

40
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:14,014
THE PARK FOR DEMOCRATS THAT THEY

41
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:15,349
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE EVEN

42
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,383
A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I'M NOT SURE

43
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:18,585
LEADING INTO A HEAVILY CONTESTED

44
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:19,353
MIDTERM ELECTION YOU WANT YOUR

45
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:20,954
GOING AWAY MESSAGE TO BE, WE DO

46
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,523
NOT LIKE DUE PROCESS WITH JUST A

47
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:24,224
KAVANAUGH AND ALSO WE ARE NOT

48
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:27,327
REALLY SORT OF NATIVE AMERICAN

49
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:27,894
WITH ELIZABETH WARREN.

50
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:30,530
THOSE DON'T SEEM LIKE TO GO GRAY

51
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:30,897
MESSAGES.

52
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:32,232
>> Martha: THEY SEEM VERY

53
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:32,933
FIRED UP ABOUT THE ELECTORAL

54
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:36,136
COLLEGE AND THE FACT THAT EVERY

55
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:36,870
STATE GETS TO GO SENATORS TO THE

56
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,772
UNITED STATES TENETS.

57
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:40,006
THAT TELLS ME THEY ARE WORRIED

58
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:44,945
THAT AS THEY LOOK FORWARD TO

59
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:46,680
HISTORY, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD

60
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:47,047
FOR THEM.

61
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:49,750
THE COMPOSITION OF THE COUNTRY.

62
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,418
>> CERTAINLY NOT IN THE SENATE.

63
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:52,452
ALSO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

64
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:56,656
AGAIN, STATES ARE SLIGHTLY

65
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,892
OUTWEIGHING PUBLISHING CENTERS.

66
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:01,828
DEMOCRATS, WE KEPT HEARING FROM

67
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:02,863
2016 THAT HILLARY WAS GOING TO

68
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:04,498
WIN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP NEED TO

69
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,432
ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE

70
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,733
ELECTION.

71
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,101
WE'VE HEARD FROM 2016 THAT WE

72
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:10,504
NEED TO CHANGE THE CONSISTENCY

73
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,139
OF THE SENATE, ABOLISH THE

ELECTORAL COLLEGE, ABOLISH ICE.

76
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,144
I GET THE FEELING THAT

77
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:18,812
ACCEPTANCE IS NOT IN THE CARDS

78
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:20,714
ANYTIME SOON.

79
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,115

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,620
AGAIN THERE THERE WAS ONE OP-ED

83
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:29,256
ARGUING THAT SHE MIGHT -- THREE

84
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:30,757
TIMES MIGHT BE THE CHARM FOR

85
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:32,025
HILLARY CLINTON.

86
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:36,129
ALSO GETTING MORE -- WITH

87
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,663
COMMENTS LIKE THIS.

88
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:39,166
LET'S WATCH THIS.

89
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,634
>> IN RETROSPECT, DO YOU THINK

90
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:43,336
BILL SHOULD'VE RESIGNED IN THE

91
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,671
WAKE OF THE MONICA LEWINSKY

92
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:45,005
SCANDAL?

93
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:46,039
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

94
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,942
>> IT WASN'T AN ABUSE OF POWER?

95
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:49,242
>> NO.

96
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:51,278
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT

97
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,947
THE INCIDENCE OF THE '90s AND

98

A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

99
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,950

THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING AND I

107
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:09,463
CAN UNDERSTAND.

00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,274
PRE#MeToo MOVEMENT.

110
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:25,312

PRIMARIES.

144
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,297
AT THIS POINT, MICHAEL AVENATTI

145
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,899
IS AS MUCH OF A GOOD LAWYER AS

146
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,100
MUCH AS LISBETH WARREN IS NATIVE

00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,236

WHEN HE FIRST PERSON ON THE

SCENE CAN MAKE YOU REALLY LOOK

154
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:33,446
HE COULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT, BEN.

155

156
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:36,983
BECAUSE THIS IS HIGHLY HIGHLY

157
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:38,818
ENTERTAINING STUFF.

158
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,755
HE'S 1/1,024TH OF A DECENT

160
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,056
HE'S BEEN HUMILIATED A COUPLE OF

167
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:54,134
AGAIN, HARVARD IS A PRIVATE
