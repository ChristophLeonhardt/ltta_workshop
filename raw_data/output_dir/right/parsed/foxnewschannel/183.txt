>> Martha: ONLY 22 MORE DAYS
TILL THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND
FEARS OF A 2016 REPEAT ARE
CREEPING IN FOR DEMOCRATS TO
SOME EXTENT, WHILE DEMOCRATIC
ENTHUSIASM REMAINS HIGH, THE
PARTY LEADS IN THE GENERIC
CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT.
I THINK AT ABOUT 7%, THE AVERAGE
NUMBER OF THE LEAD FOR THE
DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW, BUT A
RECENT REPORT CAUTIONS NERVOUS
DEMOCRATS TO WIN ELECTION DAY
DISASTER.
HERE NOW, BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR
AND CHIEF OF THE DailyWire.com
DAILYWIRE.COM.
GOOD FOR -- YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT THIS VERY CLOSELY THE PAST
FEW WEEKS.
DO YOU THINK THEIR FEARS ARE
JUSTIFIED?
>> THERE'S A REASON TO BE AFRAID
THAT THERE ARE POLES THAT CAME
OUT AND BATTLEGROUND DISTRICTS
DISTRICTS SHOWING REPUBLICANS
RUNNING EVEN WITH DEMOCRATS
IN A ENORMOUS BATTLEGROUND
DISTRICTS, THOSE BEING THE
DISTRICT THAT WERE VERY
COMPETITIVE BETWEEN
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
HILLARY CLINTON.
THE MAP LOOKS, TO ME, AS THOUGH
THE RED AREAS ARE GETTING REDDER
AND THE BLUE AREAS ARE GETTING
BLUER, THE PURPLE AREAS ARE
GETTING MORE PURPLE.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A WALK IN
THE PARK FOR DEMOCRATS THAT THEY
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE EVEN
A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I'M NOT SURE
LEADING INTO A HEAVILY CONTESTED
MIDTERM ELECTION YOU WANT YOUR
GOING AWAY MESSAGE TO BE, WE DO
NOT LIKE DUE PROCESS WITH JUST A
KAVANAUGH AND ALSO WE ARE NOT
REALLY SORT OF NATIVE AMERICAN
WITH ELIZABETH WARREN.
THOSE DON'T SEEM LIKE TO GO GRAY
MESSAGES.
>> Martha: THEY SEEM VERY
FIRED UP ABOUT THE ELECTORAL
COLLEGE AND THE FACT THAT EVERY
STATE GETS TO GO SENATORS TO THE
UNITED STATES TENETS.
THAT TELLS ME THEY ARE WORRIED
THAT AS THEY LOOK FORWARD TO
HISTORY, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
FOR THEM.
THE COMPOSITION OF THE COUNTRY.
>> CERTAINLY NOT IN THE SENATE.
ALSO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
AGAIN, STATES ARE SLIGHTLY
OUTWEIGHING PUBLISHING CENTERS.
DEMOCRATS, WE KEPT HEARING FROM
2016 THAT HILLARY WAS GOING TO
WIN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP NEED TO
ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE
ELECTION.
WE'VE HEARD FROM 2016 THAT WE
NEED TO CHANGE THE CONSISTENCY
OF THE SENATE, ABOLISH THE
SUPREME COURT, ABOLISH THE
ELECTORAL COLLEGE, ABOLISH ICE.
I GET THE FEELING THAT
ACCEPTANCE IS NOT IN THE CARDS
ANYTIME SOON.
>> HILLARY CLINTON RAISING A LOT
OF LIGHT IN THE LIMELIGHT
RAISING CONSIDERING RUNNING
AGAIN THERE THERE WAS ONE OP-ED
ARGUING THAT SHE MIGHT -- THREE
TIMES MIGHT BE THE CHARM FOR
HILLARY CLINTON.
ALSO GETTING MORE -- WITH
COMMENTS LIKE THIS.
LET'S WATCH THIS.
>> IN RETROSPECT, DO YOU THINK
BILL SHOULD'VE RESIGNED IN THE
WAKE OF THE MONICA LEWINSKY
SCANDAL?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
>> IT WASN'T AN ABUSE OF POWER?
>> NO.
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT
THE INCIDENCE OF THE '90s AND
A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
CANNOT HAVE A CONSENSUAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH AND IN TURN,
THE POWER IMBALANCE --
>> SHE WAS AN ADULT.
SEE
YOU
>> Martha: SHE DIDN'T LIKE
THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING AND I
CAN UNDERSTAND.
SHE WAS IN ADULT FOR THE
PRE#MeToo MOVEMENT.
>> DOESN'T HAVE POWER
RELATIONSHIPS ATTACHED,
SOMETIMES GOOD, SOMETIMES BAD.
SEEMS TO DEPEND ON THE DAY.
HILLARY CLINTON MAKING LIFE A
NIGHTMARE FOR DEMOCRATIC
COLLEAGUES MUST BE WISHING THAT
THEY CAN WISH HER THE CORNFIELD.
>> IDEA WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHT
ON THIS BECAUSE IT JUST BROKE
TONIGHT.
MICHAEL AVENATTI WILL NOW HAVE
TO PAY DONALD TRUMP,
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S LEGAL
FEES.
FOR THE STORMY DANIELS CASE
WHICH IS FELL APART.
HERE IS THE QUOTE FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY ON
THIS.
"NO AMOUNT OF SPIN OR COMMENTARY
BY STORMY DANIELS OR HER LAWYER
MICHAEL AVENATTI CAN
CHARACTERIZE ANY RULING OTHER
THAN THE TOTAL VICTORY FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND TOTAL DEFEAT
FOR STORMY DANIELS."
ROUGH COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR
MICHAEL AVENATTI, BEN.
>> MICHAEL AVENATTI WHO WAS MY
ENTERTAINING FRONT RUNNER TO
2020, LOOKING FORWARD FOR HIM TO
MAKE A PLAY IN THE DEMOCRATIC
PRIMARIES.
AT THIS POINT, MICHAEL AVENATTI
IS AS MUCH OF A GOOD LAWYER AS
MUCH AS LISBETH WARREN IS NATIVE
AMERICAN.
>> CAMPAIGNING IN SOUTH CAROLIN
SOUTH CAROLINA.
YOU DID CALL FOR IT IN THIS
SHOW.
WHEN HE FIRST PERSON ON THE
SCENE CAN MAKE YOU REALLY LOOK
HE COULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT, BEN.
>> I THINK AND I STILL COULD,
BECAUSE THIS IS HIGHLY HIGHLY
ENTERTAINING STUFF.
HE'S 1/1,024TH OF A DECENT
LAWYER.
HE'S BEEN HUMILIATED A COUPLE OF
TIMES IN THREE WEEKS.
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK THE
HARVARD CASE WILL OVERTURN
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?
>> YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
IT DO SO.
AGAIN, HARVARD IS A PRIVATE
INSTITUTION, NOT A PUBLIC
INSTITUTION.
