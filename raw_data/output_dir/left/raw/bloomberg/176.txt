1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,034
BE WITH YOU TODAY.

2
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,669
I WILL DISCUSS RECENT ECONOMIC

3
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,639
DEVELOPMENTS, THE OUTLOOK, AND

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,841
THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR MONETARY

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,308
POLICY.

6
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,312
MY MESSAGE WILL BE LARGELY

7
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:16,716
FAVORABLE, ALTHOUGH RECENT

8
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:17,483
DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN MIXED.

9
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:20,053
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE ECONOMY

10
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:20,787
HAS REGISTERED CONSIDERABLE

11
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:21,521
PROGRESS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

12
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,824
YEARS TOWARDS THE FEDERAL

13
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,961
RESERVE'S GOALS OF MAXIMUM

14
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,895
EMPLOYMENT AND PRICE STABILITY.

15
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:33,199
AS I WILL EXPLAIN, THERE ARE

16
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:33,967
GOOD REASONS TO EXPECT THAT WE

17
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,102
WILL EXPAND FURTHER TOWARDS

18
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:36,569
THOSE GOALS.

19
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,906
THE NEWS FROM THE LABOR MARKET

20
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:40,640
OVER THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,142
GENERALLY GOOD.

22
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,777
WITH SIGNIFICANT JOB GAINS, THE

23
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:48,781
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO KLEIN HE

24
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,883
BELOW 5%, RISING HOUSEHOLD

25
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:53,820
INCOMES, AND TENTATIVE SIGNS OF

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,454
FASTER WAGE GROWTH.

27
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,756
AT THE SAME TIME, RECENT SIGNS

28
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,092
OF A SLOWDOWN IN JOB CREATION

29
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,695
BEAR CLOSE WATCHING.

30
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,964
INFLATION HAS BEEN LOWER THAN

31
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,933
THE OBJECTIVE OF 2%, THAT I

32
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:11,237
EXPECTED TO MOVE UP OVER TIME

33
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,472
FOR REASONS I WILL DESCRIBE.

34
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,339
IF INCOMING DATA ARE CONSISTENT

35
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,542
WITH LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS

36
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,344
STRENGTHENING, AND INFLATION

37
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:23,049
MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE 2%

38
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,651
OBJECTIVE, AS I EXPECT, FURTHER

39
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,485
GRADUAL INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL

40
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,387
FUNDS RATE ARE LIKELY TO BE

41
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,890
APPROPRIATE, AND MOST CONDUCIVE

42
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,758
TO MEETING AND MAINTAINING THOSE

43
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,493
OBJECTIVES.

44
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,028
HOWEVER, I WAS EMPHASIZED THAT

45
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,063
MONETARY POLICY IS NOT ON A

46
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:41,100
PRESET COURSE, AND SIGNIFICANT

47
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,302
SHIFTS IN THE OUTLOOK OF THE

48
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,171
ECONOMY WOULD NECESSITATE

49
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,206
CORRESPONDING SHIFTS IN THE

50
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:52,378
APPROPRIATE PATHS OF POLICY.

51
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,813
IN PARTICULAR, AN IMPORTANT

52
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:54,614
THEME OF MY REMARKS TODAY WILL

53
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616
BE THE INEVITABLE UNCERTAINTY

54
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,550
SURROUNDING THE OUTLOOK FOR THE

55
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,919
ECONOMY.

56
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,188
UNFORTUNATELY, ALL ECONOMIC

57
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,556
PROJECTIONS ARE CERTAIN TO TURN

58
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:15,068
OUT TO BE IN BE IN ACCURATE -- 

59
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:15,868
INACCURATE IN SOME RESPECTS, AND

60
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:16,602
POSSIBLY, SIGNIFICANTLY SO.

61
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:17,337
WILL THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN

62
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,104
EUROPE OR CHINA TAKE A TURN FOR

63
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:18,671
THE WORST OR EXCEED

64
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,138
EXPECTATIONS?

65
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,841
WILL U.S. PRODUCTIVITY

66
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,878
GROWTH PICK UP AND ALLOW A

67
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:26,679
STRONGER GROWTH OF GROSS TO MR.

68
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,350
PRODUCT AND INCOMES, OR WILL IT

69
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,018
CONTINUE TO STAGNATE?

70
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:32,819
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE PRICE OF

71
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,987
OIL?

72
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,958
THE UNCERTAINTIES ARE SIZABLE.

73
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,828
PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR GOALS, AND

74
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,562
BY LOCATION, THE APPROPRIATE

75
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,863
STANCE OF MONETARY POLICY, WILL

76
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,165
DEPEND ON HOW THESE

77
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,033
UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED.

78
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,669
INDEED, THE POLICY PATH THAT MY

79
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,772
COLLEAGUES AND I JUDGE AS MOST

80
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:58,478
LIKELY TO ACHIEVE A MAXIMUM

81
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,278
EMPLOYMENT AND PRICE STABILITY

82
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:00,046
HAS EVOLVED AND WILL CONTINUE TO

83
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,814
EVOLVE IN RESPONSE TO

84
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,116
DEVELOPMENTS THAT ALTER OUR

85
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,584
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND THE

86
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,788
ASSOCIATED RISKS.

87
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,622
THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION FOLLOWING

88
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,924
THE GREAT RECESSION HAS BEEN

89
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,159
UNDERWAY FOR SEVEN YEARS.

90
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,895
THE RECOVERY HAS NOT ALWAYS

91
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,965
BEEN SMOOTH, BUT OVERALL, THE

92
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:23,035
GAINS HAVE AN IMPRESSIVE, IN

93
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:26,205
PARTICULAR, THE JOB MARKET HAS

94
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:26,939
STRENGTHENED SUBSTANTIALLY.

95
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,809
I BELIEVE WE ARE NOW CLOSE TO

96
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:30,643
ELIMINATING THE SLACK THAT HAS

97
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,377
WEIGHED ON THE LABOR MARKET

98
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,547
SINCE THE RECESSION.

99
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:39,652
I WILL TURN TO THIS PAST FRIDAY

100
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:45,625
Y'S LABOR MARKET REPORT IN A

101
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,025
MOMENT.

102
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:46,659
FIRST, SOME BACKGROUND.

103
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:51,598
THE ECONOMY ADDED AN AVERAGE OF

104
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,331
 230,000 JOBS PER MONTH.

105
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:57,437
DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF

106
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,237
THIS YEAR, PAYROLLS WERE GROWING

107
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:03,242
ONLY MIRED SHIRLEY -- MODERATELY

108
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:03,643
SLOWER.

109
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,479
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAD FALLEN

110
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,384
TO A VOTE OF 5% -- BELOW 5%.

111
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,185
IN ADDITION, THE MEASURE OF THE

112
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:18,423
JOB OPENING RATE WAS AT A RECORD

113
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:21,461
HIGH IN MARCH, AND THE SHARE OF

114
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,430
EMPLOYEES VOLUNTARILY LEAVING

115
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,467
THEIR JOBS HAS MOVED UP.

116
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,739
IN MARCH, IT STOOD CLOSE TO ITS

117
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,574
PRE-RECESSION LEVELS.

118
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,043
THE INCREASE IN THE QUIT RATE

119
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,312
MEANS THAT WORKERS ARE FEELING

120
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,315
MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT THE JOB

121
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,151
MARKET AND LIKELY RECEIVING MORE

122
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:45,651
JOB OFFERS.

123
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:47,787
THE OVERALL SITUATION HAS BEEN

124
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,354
QUITE POSITIVE.

125
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,357
IN THAT CONTEXT, THIS PAST

126
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,459
FRIDAY IS LABOR MARKET REPORT

127
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,060
WAS DISAPPOINTING.

128
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,630
PAYROLL GAINS WERE REPORTED TO

129
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,798
BE MUCH SMALLER IN APRIL AND A

130
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:07,407
BEEN EARLIER IN THE YEAR -- THEN

131
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,074
EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

132
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:08,875
WHILE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS

133
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,644
REPORTED TO HAVE FALLEN

134
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:15,081
FURTHER IN MAY, THE DECLINE OF

135
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:15,882
 OCCURRED NOT BECAUSE MORE

136
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,652
PEOPLE HAD JOBS, BUT FEWER

137
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,120
PEOPLE REPORTED THAT THEY WERE

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,821
ACTIVELY SEEKING WORK.

139
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,789
A BROADER MEASURE OF LABOR

140
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,659
MARKET SLACK THAT INCLUDES

141
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,961
WORKERS MARGINALLY ATTACHED TO

142
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,597
THE WORKFORCE AND THOSE WHO ARE

143
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,466
WORKING PART-TIME THAT WOULD

144
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,570
PREFER A FULL-TIME REMAINED

145
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,037
UNCHANGED.

146
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:38,905
HOWEVER, AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS

147
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,141
FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IN THE

148
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,910
NON-FOREIGN PRIVATE SECTOR

149
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,281
INCREASED 2.5% IN THE LAST 12

150
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,316
MONTHS, A BIT FASTER IN RECENT

151
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,150
YEARS AND A WELCOME INDICATION

152
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,018
THAT WAGE GROWTH MAY FINALLY BE

153
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,822
PICKING UP.

154
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:57,623
ALTHOUGH THE RECENT LABOR MARKET

155
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,594
REPORT WAS UNBALANCED, LET ME

156
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,931
EMPHASIZE THAT ONE SHOULD NEVER

157
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:05,731
ATTACH TOO MUCH SIGNIFICANCE TO

158
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:12,638
ANY SINGLE MONTHLY REPORT.

159
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,439
OTHER TIMELY INDICATORS FROM

160
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,207
THE LABOR MARKET HAVE BEEN MORE

161
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:15,641
POSITIVE.

162
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,309
FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUMBER OF

163
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,611
PEOPLE FILING NEW CLAIMS FOR

164
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,378
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, WHICH

165
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,014
CAN BE GOOD EARLY INDICATOR OF

166
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,183
CHANGES IN LABOR MARKET

167
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,118
CONDITIONS REMAINS QUITE LOW.

168
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:28,187
THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTIONS OF THE

169
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,423
HEALTH OF THE LABOR MARKET, AS

170
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,992
REPORTED IN VARIOUS CONSUMER

171
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,461
SURVEYS, REMAINS POSITIVE.

172
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:40,199
THAT SAID, THE MONTHLY

173
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,933
LABOR MARKET REPORT IS AN

174
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,202
IMPORTANT ECONOMIC INDICATOR.

175
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,305
WE WILL NEED TO WATCH LABOR

176
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,106
MARKET DEVELOPMENTS CAREFULLY.

177
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:51,177
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HERE IN THE

178
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,111
PHILADELPHIA METROPOLITAN AREA

179
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,747
HAVE IMPROVED BROADLY IN LINE

180
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,649
WITH NATIONAL TRENDS.

181
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,185
DURING THE DOWNTURN, THE

182
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,553
PHILADELPHIA AREA AND THE CITY

183
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:06,392
ITSELF SAW UNEMPLOYMENT RISE

184
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,193
LESS THAN IT DID FOR THE NATION

185
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,461
AS A WHOLE.

186
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,429
BUT, UNEMPLOYMENT TOOK LONGER TO

187
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,697
RECOVER THEREAFTER.

188
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,801
IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA IN

189
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:16,535
PARTICULAR, UNEMPLOYMENT WAS

190
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:19,338
STILL RUNNING ABOVE 10% AS

191
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,607
RECENTLY AS 2013.

192
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,775
BUT, UNEMPLOYMENT HERE HAVE

193
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,746
FALLEN SINCE THEN HELPED BY A

194
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:31,818
REVIVAL OF CONSTRUCTION, AS

195
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,054
EVIDENCED AROUND THE CITY.

196
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:35,855
WHILE THE GENERAL PICTURE OF THE

197
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,924
LABOR MARKET IS LARGELY

198
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:39,759
POSITIVE, SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL

199
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,192
STRUGGLING.

200
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,661
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES RAISED MORE

201
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:47,933
-- ROSE MORE DURING THE

202
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:48,768
RECESSION FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS

203
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,468
AND HISPANICS THAN FOR THE

204
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,237
NATION OVERALL.

205
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,104
EVEN THOSE THOSE RATES HAVE ALSO

206
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,773
COME DOWN BY MORE DURING THE

207
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,776
ECONOMIC EXPANSION, UNEMPLOYMENT

208
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:02,248
REMAINS HIGHER FOR THESE GROUPS.

209
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,082
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE GAPS HAVE

210
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,953
NOT NARROWED NOTICEABLY

211
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,855
RELATIVE TO WHERE THEY WERE

212
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,758
BEFORE THE RECESSION.

213
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,627
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR YOUNG

214
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,730
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC

215
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,464
MEN WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE

216
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,765
REMAIN ESPECIALLY HIGH.

217
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:23,135
ONE IMPORTANT AND IF IT FROM

218
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:23,936
FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN THE LABOR

219
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,905
MARKET WOULD BE INCREASED JOB

220
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,774
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE MEN AND

221
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,542
OTHER GROUPS THAT CURRENTLY

222
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,176
STILL EXPERIENCE HIGH

223
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,010
UNEMPLOYMENT.

224
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,414
TO BE SURE, MANY OF THE FACTORS

225
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,183
THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE LABOR

226
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,650
MARKET OUTCOMES OF MINORITY

227
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,886
GROUPS ARE NOT AMENABLE TO MY

228
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,188
TERRY POLICY, AND MEASURES BE ON

229
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,858
THE SCOPE OF MONETARY POLICY

230
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,726
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO

231
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:53,065
ALLEVIATE THE ECONOMIC

232
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,433
CHALLENGES THAT THESE AND OTHER

233
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:54,967
AMERICANS FACE.

234
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:55,701
EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE OF

235
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,470
COURSE VITAL.

236
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,338
LATER TODAY, I WILL VISIT ONE

237
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:03,209
PROGRAM THAT HELPS WORKERS IN

238
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,977
PHILADELPHIA LEARN NEW SKILLS

239
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,846
AND THEN CONNECT THEM WITH

240
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,081
POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS.

241
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,950
AN INITIATIVE IN WHICH

242
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,285
GOVERNMENT, BUSINESSES, AND

243
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:15,387
LOCAL INSTITUTIONS ARE WORKING

244
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,557
TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY.

245
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,427
WHILE THE ECONOMY HAS MADE GREAT

246
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,496
STRIDES TOWARDS THE OBJECTIVE OF

247
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,832
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT, SOMEWHAT

248
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:27,600
LESS PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE

249
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,938
TOWARDS THE INFLATION OBJECTIVE.

250
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,772
INFLATION HAS RUN CONSISTENTLY

251
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,140
BELOW THE GOAL OF 2% OVER THE

252
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,275
PAST SEVERAL YEARS, EVEN AS THE

253
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,311
LABOR MARKET STRENGTH AND

254
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,981
SIGNIFICANTLY.

255
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:42,882
OVER THE 12 MONTH THROUGH APRIL,

256
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,483
THE PRICE INDEX FOR PERSONAL

257
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,185
CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES ROSE

258
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,722
ONLY ABOUT 1%.

259
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,793
I REMAIN OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE TWO

260
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,927
FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN HOLDING

261
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,728
FOUND INFLATION WILL LIKELY

262
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,397
PROVE ONLY TEMPORARY.

263
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,468
FIRST, THE SHARP DROP IN CRUDE

264
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,269
OIL PRICES SINCE THE MIDDLE OF

265
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,339
2014 HAS LOWERED PRICES OF

266
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:13,045
GASOLINE AND OTHER ENERGY

267
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:13,746
PRODUCTS, SIGNIFICANTLY

268
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,480
STRAINING OVERALL INFLATION.

269
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,181
AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE

270
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,883
FOREIGN EXCHANGE VALUE OF THE

271
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:18,651
DOLLAR STRENGTHENED, HOLDING

272
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,987
DOWN PRICES OF IMPORTED GOODS.

273
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:34,967
OIL PRICES HAVE STOPPED

274
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,434
DECLINING.

275
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,268
INDEED, THEY HAVE RISEN FROM THE

276
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:36,969
LOW POINT EARLIER THIS YEAR.

277
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,703
AND THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,

278
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:38,404
THE DOLLAR HAS BEEN ROUGHLY

279
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,171
UNCHANGED AGAINST A BROAD WRATH

280
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,239
OF CURRENCIES -- BATH OF

281
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,541
CURRENCIES.

282
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,409
AS THE LABOR MARKET STRENGTHENS

283
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,313
FURTHER, I EXPECT INFLATION TO

284
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,714
MOVE BACK TO 2%.

285
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:49,582
LET ME NOW TURN TO THE OUTLOOK

286
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,518
FOR THE ECONOMY.

287
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,520
GDP GROWTH WAS REPORTED TO HAVE

288
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,324
BEEN RELATIVELY WEAK THIS YEAR.

289
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,159
THIS MEASURE OF GROWTH AND

290
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,228
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY CAN VARY

291
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,530
SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER TO

292
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,132
QUARTER.

293
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,167
INDEED, WHILE SPENDING DATA FOR

294
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,103
THE SECOND QUARTER ARE LIMITED

295
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,372
AT PRESENT, RECENT DATA ON

296
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,573
RETAIL SALES AND MOTOR VEHICLE

297
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:20,913
SALES .2 A SIGNIFICANT STEP UP

298
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,015
IN CONSUMER SPENDING AND GDP

299
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,582
GROWTH THIS QUARTER.

300
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,084
STEPPING BACK FROM NEAR TERM

301
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:25,851
INDICATORS, I WOULD LIKE TO

302
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,586
FOCUS MORE BROADLY ON THE

303
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,890
FACTORS LIKELY TO AFFECT

304
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,690
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OVER THE

305
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,892
COMING YEARS.

306
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,794
NEXT WEEK, CONCURRENT WITH OUR

307
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:38,931
POLICY MEETING, PARTICIPANTS

308
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,167
WILL RELEASE A NEW SET OF

309
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,336
ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS.

310
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,137
THOSE COULD OF COURSE DIFFER

311
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,108
FROM THE PREVIOUS SET OF SAID

312
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,911
PROJECTIONS IN MARCH, BUT,

313
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,214
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, ALTHOUGH

314
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:55,948
THE ECONOMY HAS RECENTLY BEEN

315
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,883
AFFECTED BY A MIX OF

316
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,186
COUNTERVAILING FORCES, ICY GOOD

317
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,889
REASONS TO EXPECT THAT A

318
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,793
POSITIVE FORCE IS SUPPORTING

319
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,895
GROWTH AND HIGHER INFLATION BOOK

320
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,963
CONTINUE TO OUTWEIGH THE

321
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,599
NEGATIVE ONES.

322
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,466
AS A RESULT, I EXPECT ECONOMIC

323
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,235
EXPANSION TO CONTINUE WITH THE

324
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,506
LABOR MARKET GROWING FURTHER AND

325
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,307
GDP GROWING MODERATELY.

326
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,910
I EXPECT TO SEE GDP -- INFLATION

327
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,314
MOVING TO 2% OVER THE COMING

328
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:28,681
YEARS.

329
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,750
LET ME START WITH THE POSITIVE.

330
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,485
THE INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT OVER

331
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:34,253
THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS

332
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:39,458
CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER HOUSEHOLD

333
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,192
INCOMES AND STRENGTHENING

334
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:40,793
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.

335
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,660
IT'S IN MAY LABOR REPORT WAS AN

336
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,431
ABERRATION, OR REFLECTS A

337
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,165
TEMPORARY SLOWDOWN RESULTING

338
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,302
FROM THE WEAKNESS IN ECONOMIC

339
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,036
ACTIVITY AT THE START OF THE

340
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,205
YEAR, THEN JOB GROWTH SHOULD

341
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,441
PICK UP AND SUPPORT FURTHER

342
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,377
GROWTH IN INCOME.

343
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,178
IN ADDITION, RISING EQUITY AND

344
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,480
HOUSE PRICES HAS RESTORED

345
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,047
HOUSEHOLD WEALTH.

346
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:06,518
THE FOLLOWING -- FALL IN OIL

347
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:11,623
PRICES HAS SUPPORTED PURCHASING

348
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:12,124
POWER AS WELL.

349
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,159
AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD HAS GAINED

350
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,629
SOME $1300 IN PURCHASING POWER

351
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,564
SINCE MAY 2014 FROM THE FALL IN

352
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:23,102
GAS PRICES.

353
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:23,836
WITH CONTINUING GAINS AND

354
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,571
DISPOSABLE INCOME IN WEALTH, I

355
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,673
EXPECT CONSUMER SPENDING TO GROW

356
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,842
AT A SOLID RATE.

357
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,111
I ALSO EXPECT THE HOUSING SECTOR

358
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,480
TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS.

359
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,781
BOTH HOME SALES AND CONSTRUCTION

360
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:39,251
HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY IMPROVING

361
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,085
AND RESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT MADE

362
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,156
A NOTABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GDP

363
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,359
GROWTH OVER THE PAST YEAR.

364
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,193
HOUSING HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY

365
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:52,197
LOW MORTGAGE RATES AND ALL

366
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:52,898
MORTGAGE CREDIT IS STILL

367
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,565
DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FOR

368
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:54,433
HOUSEHOLDS WITH LOW CREDIT

369
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,268
SCORES WERE HARD TO DOCUMENT

370
00:13:56,268 --> 00:14:00,606
INCOME, THOSE WITH GOOD CREDIT

371
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,440
HISTORIES ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO

372
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,175
BORROW AT VERY FAVORABLE TERMS.

373
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:09,215
AND,  FISCAL POLICY AT

374
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,284
COMBINED LOCAL, STATE, AND

375
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:17,289
NATIONAL LEVELS HA -- IS NOW A

376
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,357
SMALL POSITIVE.

377
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:23,996
ECONOMISTS OFTEN SAY, WELL

378
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:28,133
KEEPING WITH THAT TRADITION, I

379
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:34,940
WILL NOW -- ECONOMISTS OFTEN

380
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,574
SAY, ON THE ONE HAND.

381
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,277
WELL KEEPING WITH THAT

382
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,078
TRADITION, I WILL NOW SAY, ON

383
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,448
THE OTHER HAND.

384
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,318
CONCERNS ABOUT SLOWING GROWTH

385
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,487
IN CHINA AND FALLING COMMODITY

386
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,589
PRICES WHICH AFFLICTED FINANCIAL

387
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,325
MARKETS EARLY THIS YEAR AND

388
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,160
LIKELY WEIGHED ON DEMANDS APPEAR

389
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,364
TO HAVE EASED SOMEWHAT.

390
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:01,433
INDICATORS SUGGEST THAT FOREIGN

391
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,234
ECONOMIES ARE GROWING, IT'S

392
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,839
STILL HAD ONLY A MODERATE PACE.

393
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,639
FOREIGN FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE

394
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,540
RECOVERED AND STABILIZE.

395
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:16,015
THAT SAID, AND THAT EXPORTS -- 

396
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:16,849
NET EXPORTS HAVE BEEN A DRAG

397
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,685
ON GDP OVER THE LAST YEAR.

398
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:24,022
THIS DRAG, IN PART, REFLECTS THE

399
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:24,723
PROLONGED EFFECTS OF THE

400
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,825
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

401
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,428
FOREIGN EXCHANGE VALUE OF THE

402
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,529
DOLLAR SINCE THE MIDDLE OF 2014.

403
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,898
THE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN

404
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,700
PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR

405
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,370
U.S. MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER

406
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,204
FIRMS COMPETING WITH FOREIGN

407
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:39,638
PRODUCERS.

408
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:44,877
WHILE LOWER OIL PRICES HAVE

409
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,011
LIKELY BEEN A POSITIVE INFLUENCE

410
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,812
ON THE U.S. ECONOMY OVER ALL,

411
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,814
THEY ALSO HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE

412
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:53,052
SIDE, GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE U.S.

413
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,753
ENERGY INDUSTRY.

414
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,891
NEW DRILLING AND ENERGY TO

415
00:15:58,891 --> 00:15:59,725
EMPLOYMENT HAVE PLUNGED, AND THE

416
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,027
EFFECTS HAVE SPILLED OVER TO

417
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,930
BUSINESSES SERVING THE ENERGY

418
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,364
SECTOR.

419
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,266
THE LARGEST DECLINES IN DRILLING

420
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,334
ACTIVITY ARE LIKELY NOW BEHIND

421
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:09,701
US.

422
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:15,674
WITH OIL PRICES HAVING RECOVERED

423
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,475
SOMEWHAT, I EXPECT OIL PRICES

424
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,343
WILL BECOME LESS OF A FACTOR.

425
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:22,414
THIS HAS BEEN WEAK IN THE

426
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,349
PAST SIX MONTHS OR SO.

427
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:28,420
INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT

428
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,221
IS REPORTED TO HAVE DECLINED IN

429
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,590
THE LAST QUARTER OF 2015 AND THE

430
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,558
FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR.

431
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:37,462
I SUSPECT THERE IS A TRANSITORY

432
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:41,433
ELEMENT TO THIS WEAK

433
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,634
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, AND I

434
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,503
EXPECT IT TO REBOUND.

435
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,339
THE LATEST MARKET DATA RAISES

436
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:54,780
THE LIST FAVORABLE POSSIBILITY

437
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,882
THAT FIRMS MAY EXPAND SLOWLY.

438
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,953
I INTEND TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION

439
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,720
TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS AREA.

440
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,823
AS I SAID, THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC

441
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:10,829
FORCES HAVE OUTWEIGHED THE

442
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,530
NEGATIVE, AND DESPITE THE

443
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,231
CHALLENGES THAT THE ECONOMY

444
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,267
CONTINUES TO FACE, I CONTINUED

445
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,001
TO EXPECT FURTHER PROGRESS

446
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,904
TOWARDS OUR EMPLOYMENT AND

447
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:19,538
INFLATION OBJECTIVES.

448
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,473
TO BE SURE, THERE IS

449
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:23,308
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

450
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,544
THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK THAT I HAVE

451
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,310
BEEN DISCUSSING.

452
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,047
AS I HAVE ALREADY NOTED, WE

453
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,917
SHOULD EXPECT TO BE SURPRISED IN

454
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,086
THE FUTURE, JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN

455
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:34,720
SURPRISED IN THE PAST.

456
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,192
FOR AREAS OF -- FOUR AREAS OF

457
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,193
UNCERTAINTY SEEM PARTICULARLY

458
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:46,531
SALIENT AT THE PRESENT.

459
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:47,332
THE FIRST INVOLVES THE TRUST AND

460
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,568
RESILIENCE OF DOMESTIC DEMAND.

461
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,369
THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS PERFORMED

462
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,272
BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS AROUND

463
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:53,705
THE GLOBE.

464
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,140
THAT PERFORMANCE HAS RELIED IF

465
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,876
THE ON THE RESILIENCE OF

466
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,279
DOMESTIC SOURCES OF DEMAND,

467
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,549
CONSUMER SPENDING IN PARTICULAR.

468
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,684
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHETHER

469
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,518
THE U.S. ECONOMY COULD CONTINUE

470
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:10,088
TO MAKE PROGRESS AMID FAIRLY

471
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,424
CONSIDERABLE GLOBAL BUMPING

472
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:12,758
THIS.

473
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,827
I CONTINUE TO INC. THAT THE

474
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,897
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YES,

475
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:19,631
BUT THE WEAK INVESTMENT

476
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,066
PERFORMANCE IN RECENT MONTHS IS

477
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:25,103
CONCERNING AND FRIDAY'S

478
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:30,609
EMPLOYMENT REPORT IS A REMINDER

479
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,410
THAT THE QUESTION IS STILL

480
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,044
RELEVANT.

481
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:32,911
THE SECOND UNCERTAINTY PERTAINS

482
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:33,612
TO THE ECONOMIC SITUATION

483
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,847
ABROAD.

484
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,714
EVEN THOUGH THE FINANCIAL

485
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:39,518
STRESSES EMANATED FROM ABROAD AT

486
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,252
THE START OF THIS YEAR HAS

487
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,355
EASED, GLOBAL RISKS REQUIRE

488
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,623
CONTINUED ATTENTION DURING MUCH

489
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,559
OF THE TURMOIL EARLY THIS YEAR A

490
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,363
P TO THE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

491
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,499
OUTLOOK OVER CHINESE GROWTH,

492
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,801
WHICH IN TURN, HAS BROUGHT IN

493
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,804
LOCATIONS -- BROAD IMPLICATIONS

494
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,141
FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH.

495
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,876
RECENTLY, IT HAS MOVED IN A MORE

496
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:10,882
PARTICULAR FASHION AND FLOWS

497
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:11,383
HAVE ABATED.

498
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,851
HOWEVER, IT IS WHY THEY

499
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,820
KNOWLEDGE THAT CHINA FACES

500
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,755
CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES AS IT

501
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,489
CONTINUES TO REBALANCE THE

502
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,859
ECONOMY TOWARDS DOMESTIC DEMAND

503
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,860
AND CONSUMPTION.

504
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,096
MORE GENERALLY, IN THE CURRENT

505
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,698
ENVIRONMENT OF SLUGGISH GROWTH,

506
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,599
THOUGH INFLATION, AND ALREADY

507
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,038
VERY ACCOMMODATIVE MONETARY

508
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,840
POLICIES IN MANY ADVANCED

509
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,607
ECONOMIES, INVESTOR PERCEPTIONS

510
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:41,980
OF AN APPETITE FOR RISK CAN

511
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,547
CHANGE ABRUPTLY.

512
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:43,382
ONE DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD SHIFT

513
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,082
INVESTOR SENTIMENT IS THE

514
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,184
UPCOMING REFERENDUM IN THE

515
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:46,718
UNITED KINGDOM.

516
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:51,490
A U.K. VOTE TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN

517
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,357
UNION COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT

518
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,795
ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS.

519
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:57,596
THE THIRD KEY UNCERTAINTY FOR

520
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,430
THE U.S. ECONOMY IS THE OUTLOOK

521
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,165
FOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH.

522
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:05,504
THAT IS INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT

523
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,973
OF OUTPUT PRODUCED PER HOUR

524
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:08,407
WORKED.

525
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,744
WHILE THE JOB MARKET HAS

526
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,578
STRENGTHENED SIGNIFICANTLY, GDP

527
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:16,014
INCREASES HAVE BEEN LESS

528
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:16,515
IMPRESSIVE.

529
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,315
THE COMBINATION OF SOLID LABOR

530
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:21,453
MARKET GAINS AND WATER GDP

531
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,921
GROWTH REFLECTS THE FACT THAT

532
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,357
LABOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH HAS

533
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,060
BEEN UNUSUALLY WEAK IN RECENT

534
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:35,233
YEARS, AVERAGING LESS THAN .5%

535
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:35,834
PER YEAR SINCE 2010.

536
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,202
OVER TIME, PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH

537
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:41,006
IS THE KEY DETERMINANT OF

538
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:41,706
IMPROVEMENTS IN LIVING

539
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:42,174
STANDARDS.

540
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,141
SUPPORTING HIGHER PAY FOR

541
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,344
WORKERS WITHOUT INCREASED COST

542
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:46,878
FOR WORKERS.

543
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:51,450
RECENT WEAK PRODUCTIVITY

544
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,320
GROWTH ACCOUNTS FOR WAGE GAINS

545
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,058
IN THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION.

546
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:00,926
THEREFORE, UNDERSTANDING WEATHER

547
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,563
AND BY HOW MUCH IS A CRUCIAL

548
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,797
PART OF THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.

549
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,465
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT

550
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:10,936
QUESTION AND ECONOMISTS ARE

551
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,369
DIVIDED.

552
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:13,472
SOME ARE RELATIVELY OPTIMISTIC,

553
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:18,477
POINTING TO THE ONGOING CASE

554
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:22,914
THAT PROMISE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

555
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:26,585
FROM MEDICAL THERAPIES TO SELF

556
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,118
DRIVING CARS.

557
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:27,853
OTHERS BELIEVE THAT THE LOW

558
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,821
HANGING FRUIT OF INNOVATION

559
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,755
LARGELY HAS BEEN PICKED AND

560
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:38,063
THERE IS  SIMPLY LESS SCOPE

561
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:38,630
FOR FURTHER GAINS.

562
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,132
MY POSITION HAS BEEN CAUTIOUSLY

563
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:41,600
OPTIMISTIC.

564
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,367
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE

565
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,002
DEEPER SESSION HAD A

566
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,305
LONG-LASTING EFFECT IN

567
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:51,643
DEPRESSING INVESTMENT, RESEARCH

568
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,410
AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING, AND

569
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,145
THE STARTUP OF NEW FIRMS.

570
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,047
THESE FACTORS HAVE IN TURN

571
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,183
LOWERED PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH RATE

572
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,352
WITH TIME, I EXPECT THIS EFFECT

573
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,489
TO EASE IN A STRONGER ECONOMY.

574
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,325
I ALSO SEE NO SLOW DOWN

575
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:11,563
IN THE CASE WITH THE POTENTIAL

576
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,264
BENEFITS OF INNOVATION IN

577
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,598
AMERICA, WHICH LIKEWISE MAY BEAR

578
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:19,604
MORE TRUE IN A STRONGER

579
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,005
ECONOMY.

580
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,739
IN THE MEANTIME, IT WOULD BE

581
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:28,279
HELPFUL TO ADOPT PUBLIC POLICIES

582
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:28,980
TO BOOST PRODUCTIVITY.

583
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,382
STRENGTHENING EDUCATION AND

584
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,182
PROMOTING INVESTMENT -- PUBLIC

585
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:32,217
AND PRIVATE -- WILL SUPPORT

586
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:32,884
LONGER-TERM GROWTH IN

587
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,022
PRODUCTIVITY AND GREATER

588
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,722
GAINS IN LIVING STANDARDS.

589
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:40,192
A FOURTH IMPORTANT UNCERTAINTY

590
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:40,992
FOR ECONOMIC OUTLOOK INVOLVES

591
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:44,029
HOW QUICKLY INFLATION WILL MOVE

592
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,097
BACK TO 2%.

593
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,565
AS LONG AS OIL PRICES DO NOT

594
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:52,938
RESUME THE EARLIER

595
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,838
DECLINES AND THE DOLLAR DOES NOT

596
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:54,673
RISE SUBSTANTIALLY FURTHER, MIKE

597
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,810
EXPECTATION IS THAT INFLATION

598
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,078
WILL MOVE UP TO 2% OVER THE NEXT

599
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,380
1-2 YEARS.

600
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,213
BUT, OIL PRICES AND THE DOLLAR

601
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:12,490
CAN MOVE UP ADDICTIVELY -- MOVE

602
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,062
 UNPREDICTABLY.

603
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,731
ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY

604
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:24,069
IMPRECISE AND THE EFFECT ON

605
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,903
INFLATION COULD TURN OUT TO BE

606
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,072
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT, EITHER

607
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,207
UPWARD OR DOWNWARD OF WHAT I

608
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,576
EXPECT.

609
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,344
CONSIDERING THE OUTLOOK ON

610
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,947
INFLATION ALSO CONSIDERS IN PART

611
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,382
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

612
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,584
EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE RELATIVE

613
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,687
TO PRICE SETTING.

614
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,489
FOR TWO DECADES, INFLATION HAS

615
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,360
BEEN RELATIVELY UNSTABLE,

616
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,662
REACTING LESS PERSISTENTLY THAN

617
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:54,532
BEFORE TEMPORARY FACTORS LIKE

618
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:55,266
RECESSION OR A SWING IN OIL

619
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,902
PRICES.

620
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:57,736
THE MOST CONVINCING EXPLANATION

621
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,773
FOR THIS, IN MY VIEW, IS THAT

622
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,877
LONGER-TERM EXPECTATIONS HAVE

623
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:16,053
REMAINED QUITE STABLE.

624
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:18,957
PROXIES FOR THE EXPECTATIONS

625
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,760
INFERRED FROM FINANCIAL MARKET

626
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,896
INSTRUMENTS LIKE INFLATION

627
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:25,897
PROTECTED SECURITIES HAVE MOVED

628
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:30,001
DOWN MORE NOTICEABLY.

629
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,203
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE

630
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:31,970
INDICATORS POINT TO A TRUE

631
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,906
DECLINE IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT

632
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,443
ARE RELATIVE FOR PRICE SETTING.

633
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:49,888
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MEASURES MAY

634
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:50,689
REFLECT CHANGING ATTITUDES IN

635
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:51,423
INFLATION RISKS, MORE THAN

636
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,123
ACTUAL EXPECTATIONS, BUT THE

637
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:52,891
INDICATORS HAVE MOVED ENOUGH TO

638
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:53,525
GET MY CLOSE ATTENTION.

639
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,896
IF INFLATION EXPECTATIONS REALLY

640
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:58,630
ARE MOVING LOWER, THAT COULD

641
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,297
CALL INTO QUESTION WHETHER

642
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,333
INFLATION WILL MOVE BACK TO 2%

643
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,969
AS QUICKLY AS I EXPECT LET ME

644
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:08,273
NOW TURN TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF

645
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,375
THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AS WELL AS

646
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,342
THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED

647
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:13,445
WITH THE OUTLOOK FOR MONETARY

648
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,447
POLICY.

649
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,950
MY OVERALL ASSESSMENT IS THAT

650
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,552
THE CURRENT STANCE OF MONETARY

651
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,954
POLICY IS GENERALLY APPROPRIATE

652
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,022
IN THAT IT IS PROVIDING SUPPORT

653
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:29,394
FOR THE ECONOMY BY ENCOURAGING

654
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,228
FURTHER LABOR MARKET IMPROVEMENT

655
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,629
THAT WILL HELP RETURN INFLATION

656
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:36,534
TO 2%.

657
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,368
AT THE SAME TIME, I CONTINUE TO

658
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:38,103
THINK THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS

659
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:44,275
RATE PROBABLY WILL NEED TO RISE

660
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:46,511
GRADUALLY OVER TIME TO ENSURE

661
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,178
STABILITY AND MAXIMUM

662
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,380
SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT IN THE

663
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,814
LONG RUN.

664
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,682
SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS NEED ME

665
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:56,654
TO THIS -- LEAD ME TO THIS

666
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:57,155
CONCLUSION.

667
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,724
FIRST, THE CURRENT STANCE ON

668
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:16,807
MONETARY POLICY IS IN MILITANT

669
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:17,308
 EMULATIVE.

670
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:18,042
DEFINED AS THE LEVEL OF THE

671
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:22,580
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE THAT WOULD HE

672
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,081
 BE NEITHER

673
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,451
EXPANSIONARY ORD REACTIONARY.

674
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,120
THIS NEUTRAL RATE CHANGES OVER

675
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,055
TIME.

676
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:35,393
AT ANY GIVEN DATE, IT RELIES ON

677
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,194
A CONSTELLATION OF UNDERLYING

678
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:36,928
FORCES AFFECTING THE ECONOMY.

679
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,831
AT PRESENT, MANY ESTIMATES

680
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,068
SHOWED THE RATE TO BE QUITE LOW

681
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,269
BY.

682
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,572
INDEED, CLOSE TO ZERO WHEN

683
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,741
MEASURED IN REAL OR INFLATION

684
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,278
-ADJUSTED TERMS.

685
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,112
THE CURRENT ACTUAL VALUE OF THE

686
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,814
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ALSO MEASURED

687
00:26:55,814 --> 00:27:00,451
IN REAL TERMS IS EVEN LOWER.

688
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:03,488
SOMEWHERE AROUND -1%.

689
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,722
WITH THE ACTUAL REAL FEDERAL

690
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:07,692
FUNDS RATE MODESTLY BELOW THE

691
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:13,231
RELATIVELY LOW NEUTRAL RATE, THE

692
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,099
STANCE OF MONETARY POLICY AT

693
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,034
PRESENT SHOULD BE VIEWED AS

694
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:22,606
MODESTLY ACCOMMODATIVE.

695
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:24,108
WHILE THE ECONOMY IS NOW FAIRLY

696
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:24,943
CLOSE TO THE FOMC'S GOAL OF

697
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:28,279
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT, A VIEW OF

698
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,917
MODEST ACCOMMODATIVE POLICY IS

699
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,352
APPROPRIATE FOR SEVERAL REASONS.

700
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,487
FIRST, WITH INFLATION CONTINUING

701
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,224
TO RUN BELOW OUR OBJECTIVE, A

702
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:39,958
MILD UNDERSHOOTING OF THE

703
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,426
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CONSIDERED TO

704
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,994
BE NORMAL IN THE LONGER RUN

705
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:47,498
COULD HELP INFLATION, COULD HELP

706
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:48,566
MOVE INFLATION BACK TO 2% MORE

707
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:53,204
QUICKLY.

708
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,005
SECOND, A STRONGER JOB MARKET

709
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,839
COULD ALSO SUPPORT LABOR MARKET

710
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,608
IMPROVEMENT ALONG OTHER

711
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,509
DIMENSIONS, INCLUDING GREATER

712
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:01,880
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION.

713
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,747
THE THIRD REASON RELATES TO THE

714
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,315
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

715
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,485
CONSTRAINT ON CONVENTIONAL

716
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,821
MONETARY POLICY WHEN THE FEDERAL

717
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:14,959
FUNDS RATE IS NEAR ZERO.

718
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:15,660
IF INFLATION WERE TO MOVE

719
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,428
PERSISTENTLY ABOVE 2%, OR THE

720
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:19,397
ECONOMY WERE TO BECOME

721
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:23,168
NOTICEABLY OVERHEATED, THE

722
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,035
COMMITTEE COULD READILY INCREASE

723
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,804
THE TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL

724
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:29,407
FUNDS RATE.

725
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:34,879
HOWEVER, IF INFLATION WORK TO

726
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,881
REMAIN PERSISTENTLY LOW OR IF

727
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,949
THE EXPANSION WERE TO FALTER,

728
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:38,883
THE FOMC WOULD BE ABLE TO

729
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,919
PROVIDE ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

730
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:41,753
ADDITIONAL STIMULUS THROUGH

731
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,590
CONVENTIONAL MEANS.

732
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,190
THESE MOTIVATIONS

733
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,994
NOTWITHSTANDING, I CONTINUE TO

734
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:50,762
BELIEVE IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE

735
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,864
TO GRADUALLY REDUCE THE DEGREE

736
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:57,001
OF MONETARY POLICY ACCOMMODATION

737
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,069
, PROVIDED LABOR MARKET

738
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:03,141
CONDITIONS STRENGTHEN FURTHER,

739
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:03,942
AND INFLATION CONTINUES TO MAKE

740
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:08,112
PROGRESS TOWARD OUR 2% OBJECTIVE

741
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:08,446
.

742
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,247
BECAUSE MONETARY POLICY AFFECTS

743
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,016
THE ECONOMY WITH A LAG, STEPS TO

744
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,351
WITHDRAW THIS MONETARY

745
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,220
ACCOMMODATION OUGHT TO BE

746
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,990
INITIATED BEFORE THE FOMC'S

747
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,459
GOALS ARE FULLY REACHED.

748
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,293
AND IF THE HEADWINDS THAT HAVE

749
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,296
LINGERED AS THE CRISIS SLOWLY

750
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:29,233
ABATE, AS I ANTICIPATE, THIS

751
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,936
WOULD MEAN THAT THE NEUTRAL RATE

752
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:36,140
OF INTEREST ITSELF WOULD MOVE UP

753
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,941
, PROVIDING FURTHER IMPETUS TO

754
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,775
GRADUAL INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL

755
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:41,546
ONES RIGHT -- FUNDS RATE.

756
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,015
BUT I STRESS THE ECONOMIC

757
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:44,849
OUTLOOK, INCLUDING THE PACE AT

758
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,150
WHICH THE NEUTRAL RATE MAY SHIFT

759
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,187
OVER TIME IS UNCERTAIN, SO

760
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,090
MONETARY POLICY CANNOT PROCEED

761
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,659
ON ANY PRESET PATH.

762
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,528
THIS POINT IS WELL ILLUSTRATED

763
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:01,299
BY EVENTS SO FAR THIS YEAR.

764
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,535
FOR A TIME IN JANUARY AND EARLY

765
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,570
FEBRUARY, FINANCIAL MARKETS HERE

766
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,372
AND ABROAD BECAME TURBULENT, AND

767
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:13,544
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS TIGHTENED,

768
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:14,245
REFLECTING AND REINFORCING

769
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,079
CONCERNS ABOUT DOWNSIDE RISKS TO

770
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,649
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

771
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,418
IN ADDITION, DATA RECEIVED

772
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,219
DURING THE WINTER SUGGESTED U.S.

773
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:25,590
GROWTH HAD WEAKENED, EVEN AS

774
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,324
PROGRESS IN THE LABOR MARKET

775
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,295
REMAINS SOLID.

776
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,062
BECAUSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF

777
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:31,763
THESE DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE

778
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,297
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK WERE UNCLEAR,

779
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:37,969
THE FOMC DECIDED AT ITS IN

780
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,138
JANUARY, MARCH, AND APRIL

781
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:40,905
MEETINGS, THAT IT WOULD BE

782
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,740
PRUDENT TO MAINTAIN DATE

783
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,909
EXISTING TARGET RANGE FOR THE

784
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:45,777
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.

785
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,745
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS,

786
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,646
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE

787
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,748
RECOVERED SIGNIFICANTLY AND MANY

788
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,152
OF THE RISKS FROM ABROAD HAVE

789
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,887
DIMINISHED, ALTHOUGH SOME RISKS

790
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,455
REMAIN.

791
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,957
IN ADDITION, CONSUMER SPENDING

792
00:30:59,957 --> 00:31:01,692
APPEARS TO HAVE REBOUNDED,

793
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,861
PROVIDING SOME REASSURANCE THAT

794
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:07,932
OVERALL GROWTH HAS, INDEED,

795
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,301
PICKED UP AS EXPECTED.

796
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,070
UNFORTUNATELY, AS I NOTED

797
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,305
EARLIER, NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

798
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,406
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK HAVE BEEN

799
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,174
RAISED BY THE RECENTLY FOR

800
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:21,845
MARKET DATA.

801
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:22,680
IS THE MARKEDLY REDUCED PACE OF

802
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,117
HIRING IN APRIL AND MAY A

803
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:26,851
HARBINGER OF A PERSISTENT

804
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:27,652
SLOWDOWN IN THE BROADER ECONOMY?

805
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:31,222
OR WILL MONTHLY PAYROLL GAINS

806
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,125
MOVE UP TO THE SOLID PACE THEY

807
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:34,959
MAINTAINED EARLIER THIS YEAR AND

808
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,395
IN EARLY 2015?

809
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,832
DOES THE LATEST READING ON THE

810
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,632
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE INDICATE WE

811
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:42,333
ARE ESSENTIALLY BACK TO FULL

812
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,502
EMPLOYMENT?

813
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,504
OR DOES RELATIVELY SUBDUED WAGE

814
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,171
GROWTH SIGNAL MORE SLACK

815
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,540
REMAINS?

816
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,610
MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL BE

817
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,411
WRESTLING WITH THESE AND OTHER

818
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,580
RELATED QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD.

819
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,351
TO SUMMARIZE, I HAVE EXPLAINED

820
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,152
WHY I EXPECT THE U.S. ECONOMY

821
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,353
WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND WHY

822
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:06,657
I EXPECT FURTHER GRADUAL

823
00:32:06,657 --> 00:32:07,525
INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS

824
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,460
RATE WILL PROBABLY BE

825
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,597
APPROPRIATE TO BEST PROMOTE THE

826
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:17,168
FOMC'S GOALS MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT

827
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,569
AND PRICE STABILITY.

828
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,938
I HAVE ALSO LAID OUT THE

829
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:21,706
CONSIDERABLE AND UNAFFORDABLE

830
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,908
UNCERTAIN THESE THAT APPLY TO

831
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,677
BOTH THIS OUTLOOK FOR THE

832
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,812
ECONOMY, AND TO THE APPROPRIATE

833
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,982
PATH OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.

834
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:31,782
MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL MAKE

835
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,352
OUR POLICY DECISIONS BASED ON

836
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,487
WHAT INCOMING INFORMATION

837
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,589
IMPLIES FOR THE OUTLOOK, AND THE

838
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,757
RISK TO THAT OUTLOOK.

839
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:43,861
WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT MONETARY

840
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,630
POLICY IS NOT ON A PRESET COURSE

841
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,031
AND THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL

842
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,733
RESPOND TO NEW DATA AND REASSESS

843
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,801
RISK SO AS THE BEST TO ACHIEVE

844
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:52,971
OUR GOALS.

845
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,972
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

846
00:32:53,972 --> 00:33:00,010
[APPLAUSE]

847
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:05,449
SCARLET: OF COURSE, THAT IS

848
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:06,250
VENTURE JANET YELLEN WRAPPING UP

849
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,319
HER SPEECH IN PHILADELPHIA.

850
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,153
LET'S GET SOME ANALYSIS FROM

851
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:09,954
MIKE MCKEE.

852
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,823
WHAT WAS YOUR BIG TAKE AWAY?

853
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:18,796
MIKE: JANET YELLEN WAS AS

854
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:19,630
SURPRISED BY ANYBODY ELSE AT THE

855
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,299
ECONOMIC WEAKNESS IN MAY.

856
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,133
AT THIS POINT, SHE IS TRYING TO

857
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,802
FIGURE OUT WHERE WE GO FROM HERE

858
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,538
WITHOUT BEING TOO PESSIMISTIC.

859
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,239
NOW SHE WILL TAKE SOME

860
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,007
QUESTIONS, I GUESS.

861
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,143
>> WHETHER TO KEEP SHORT-TERM

862
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,812
INTEREST RATES LOW, IS YOUR

863
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,949
PRIMARY CONCERN GDP GROWTH AND

864
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:38,849
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER THE

865
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:42,954
NEXT FEW YEARS, OR DO YOU ALSO

866
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,123
CONSIDER THE NEGATIVE FOLLOW-ON

867
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:47,892
EFFECTS THAT OCCUR MUCH LATER,

868
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:52,163
DUE TO LOW INTEREST RATES, SUCH

869
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:56,601
AS -- AS YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE

870
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,270
-- CONSUMERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

871
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:05,142
THE LOW INTEREST RATES, DEFINED

872
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,111
PENSION BENEFIT PLANS HAVING TO

873
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,914
INVEST MORE MONEY, MEANING LESS

874
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:15,518
SPENDING NOW, OR ALTERNATIVELY,

875
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:16,254
UNDERFUNDED NOW AND DEFAULT

876
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:16,587
LATER.

877
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,455
DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO

878
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,658
CONSIDERATION?

879
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,492
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU BALANCE

880
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,326
ONE VERSUS THE OTHER?

881
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,329
CHAIR YELLEN: THANK YOU FOR THE

882
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,632
QUESTION.

883
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:32,235
THE FEDERAL RESERVE TAKES ITS

884
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:32,902
MANDATE AND APPROPRIATE

885
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:38,476
OBJECTIVES FROM CONGRESS.

886
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,411
CONGRESS HAS ASSIGNED TO US TWO

887
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,581
MAIN GOALS, MAINLY FULL

888
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:48,386
EMPLOYMENT, AND PRICE STABILITY.

889
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,755
THAT IS OUR FOCUS.

890
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:55,192
THAT IS WHAT WE KEEP OUR EYES ON

891
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:55,493
.

892
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,793
YOU ASKED IF OUR FOCUS IS JUST

893
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:59,463
THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS, AND

894
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:00,631
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

895
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,466
NO.

896
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:03,267
WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE A MEDIUM

897
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,270
AND LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE IN

898
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:12,977
SETTING MONETARY POLICY.

899
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,846
WE RESPOND, AND OUR VIEWS ON

900
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,516
POLICY, RESPOND TO INCOMING DATA

901
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,317
SUCH AS THE SURPRISE LIKE THE

902
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,386
LABOR MARKET REPORT LAST FRIDAY,

903
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,489
ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

904
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:29,627
DETERMINE, OR COME TO THE VIEW,

905
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,428
THAT THE DATA IS MEANINGFUL IN

906
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,596
TERMS OF CHANGING OUR VIEW OF

907
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:33,331
THE MEDIUM AND LONGER-TERM

908
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,033
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.

909
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:36,867
SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON A MEDIUM

910
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,769
AND LONGER-TERM.

911
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:43,074
YOU MENTIONED VARIOUS NEGATIVE

912
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,475
IMPACTS OF LOW INTEREST RATES,

913
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:49,947
WHICH WE WILL RECOGNIZE -- WELL

914
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,849
RECOGNIZE.

915
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,218
YOU MENTIONED THE IMPACT ON

916
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:54,952
INSURANCE COMPANIES, PENSION

917
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:55,720
FUNDS, THE FACT THAT LOW

918
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,956
INTEREST RATES CAN REACH

919
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,925
ENTITIES LIKE NOSE, BUT ALSO

920
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,427
ORDINARY INVESTORS TO REACH FOR

921
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:07,031
YIELD TO TAKE ON RISK THAT COULD

922
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,266
ULTIMATELY HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE

923
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,168
CONSEQUENCES.

924
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:14,105
OF COURSE, AS WE SAW, MOST

925
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,140
IMPORTANTLY AND DRAMATICALLY IN

926
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,676
THE CASE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

927
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,046
, SUCH RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR,

928
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:29,153
WHEN IT BECOMES REALLY EXCESSIVE

929
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,555
, HAS IN THE MEDIUM AND

930
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,390
LONGER-TERM, VERY SERIOUS

931
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,493
AFFECTS FOR THE ECONOMY, AND THE

932
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,227
ATTAINMENT OF EMPLOYMENT AND

933
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,829
PRICE STABILITY GOALS THAT

934
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,665
CONGRESS ASSIGNED TO US.

935
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:44,568
SO WE LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT

936
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:46,704
FINANCIAL STABILITY RISKS.

937
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,273
WE TRY TO ASSESS THOSE.

938
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:58,682
ON OCCASIONS, I THINK, WHILE

939
00:36:58,682 --> 00:36:59,417
MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I

940
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,484
BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS

941
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,453
THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS

942
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,023
EMERGING FINANCIAL STABILITY

943
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,092
RISK, SO-CALLED SUPERVISORY

944
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:08,926
TOOLS, I WOULD NEVER RULE OUT

945
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:14,165
THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF WE

946
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:14,999
THOUGHT A STANCE OF LOW INTEREST

947
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,635
RATES WAS GIVING RISE TO SERIOUS

948
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,972
FINANCIAL STABILITY RISKS, THAT

949
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:22,773
THAT COULD BE A FACTOR AFFECTING

950
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,874
POLICY.

951
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:28,279
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

952
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,047
TODAY.

953
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,383
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ABOUT THE

954
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,150
DYNAMICS ON THE COMMITTEE AND

955
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,086
YOUR ROLE AS CHAIR.

956
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,388
I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF

957
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,122
IMPRESSION IN THE FINANCIAL

958
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,924
METEOR AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS

959
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,691
THAT ESSENTIALLY YOUR VOTE IS

960
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:45,429
THE ONE THAT MATTERS.

961
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,297
CLEARLY, YOU ARE THE CHAIR, BUT

962
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,265
THERE ARE ALSO THE OTHER PEOPLE

963
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:49,233
IN THE ROOM.

964
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:53,370
I WONDER HOW YOU VIEW YOUR ROLE,

965
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,171
COMING INTO THE MEETING WITH AN

966
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:54,939
OUTCOME YOU ARE EXPECTING,

967
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,308
VERSUS JUDGING WHERE THE

968
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,242
COMMITTEE IS.

969
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,977
I WONDER IF YOU FACED THIS

970
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,246
SITUATION IT DURING YOUR TERM AS

971
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,348
CHAIR, WHERE YOU WERE EXPECTING

972
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,083
ONE OUTCOME AND WERE SWAYED BY

973
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,418
THE COMMITTEE.

974
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:12,490
CHAIR YELLEN: THANK YOU.

975
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,093
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WAS

976
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:22,466
INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO BE ONE

977
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,535
WHERE MANY INDEPENDENT VOICES

978
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:30,574
AND FINGERS -- THINKERS WOULD

979
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,377
COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER,

980
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,144
BUT TO BRING TOGETHER IN THE

981
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:36,580
POINT IT -- INDEPENDENT POINTS

982
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,918
OF VIEW FORMED IN PART BY THE

983
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,720
CONTEXT BY THE RESERVE BANK

984
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,656
PRESIDENTS AND WE IN WASHINGTON

985
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,526
ALSO HAVE CONTACTS WITH OUR

986
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,561
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, BUSINESSES,

987
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,798
HOUSEHOLDS, CONSUMERS IN OUR

988
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,634
COMMUNITIES, ASSESSING AND

989
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,503
BRINGING TO BEAR INFORMATION

990
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,771
ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND THE

991
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:04,975
OUTLOOK.

992
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:05,709
I HAVE ASSEMBLED AROUND THE

993
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:09,880
TABLE AT THE MOMENT -- WE ARE

994
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,482
TWO SHORT.

995
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,918
WE ARE 17 INTELLIGENT,

996
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,821
THOUGHTFUL INDIVIDUALS WHO COME

997
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:18,522
WITH THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT

998
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,990
THOUGHTS.

999
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:25,229
I FEEL MY JOB IS TO, FIRST OF

1000
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,366
ALL, ADD MY OWN THOUGHTS.

1001
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,233
I AM ALSO THINKING ABOUT ALL OF

1002
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,036
THIS DATA AND WHAT IS THE RIGHT

1003
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,004
POLICY.

1004
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:34,772
WE SHARE OUR THOUGHTS WITH ONE

1005
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,474
ANOTHER.

1006
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,308
NOT ONLY AT THE MEETING BUT ALSO

1007
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,910
IN THE RUN-UP TO THE MEETING AND

1008
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,711
IN OTHER OCCASIONS WE TALKED TO

1009
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:45,583
ONE ANOTHER.

1010
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,483
I LOOK TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS IN

1011
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:47,184
THE COMMITTEE.

1012
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:51,255
SOMETIMES PEOPLE TO SEND --

1013
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,258
DISSENT.

1014
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,626
I BELIEVE I HAVE SEEN AS MANY AS

1015
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:59,930
THREE DISSENTS ON ONE

1016
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,364
OCCASION.

1017
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:06,236
CERTAINLY, SOME DISSENT IS TO BE

1018
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:06,937
EXPECTED IN AN ECONOMY AS

1019
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:10,174
COMPLEX AS OURS, SOMETIMES

1020
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,242
CHANGES BASED ON INTERPRETATIONS

1021
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,245
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.

1022
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,880
I AM LOOKING TO FIND A CONSENSUS

1023
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,216
TO TRY TO HELP FORM THAT

1024
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,718
CONSENSUS.

1025
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:24,588
I THINK MY COLLEAGUES LOOKED TO

1026
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,289
ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT

1027
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,890
CONSENSUS IS.

1028
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,295
I WILL SAY, I HAVE NEVER FOUND

1029
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,464
IT A DIFFICULTY TO BE IN THAT

1030
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:39,370
CONSENSUS MYSELF, SO I CANNOT

1031
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,773
THINK OF ANY OCCASION WHERE THE

1032
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,842
OUTCOME, OR DECISION AT A

1033
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,945
MEETING, IS ONE THAT I HAVE NOT

1034
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:48,712
BEEN PERSONALLY COMFORTABLE

1035
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,847
WITH.

1036
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,714
I THINK WE HAVE COME TOGETHER AS

1037
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,484
A COMMITTEE, AND WHILE THERE ARE

1038
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,419
A RANGE OF VIEWS, THE WORLD

1039
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,455
HEARS THEM EXPRESSED, I THINK WE

1040
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,391
HAVE CONSIDERABLE CONSENSUS AND

1041
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,625
RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER.

1042
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:06,697
>> MY QUESTION REGARDS

1043
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,832
COMMUNICATION AND THE ABILITY TO

1044
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:09,667
PROVIDE ANY INSIGHT OR FORWARD

1045
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,701
GUIDANCE TO THE FINANCIAL

1046
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:14,171
MARKETS, WHICH ARE NO DONE

1047
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:14,938
WATCHING ALL OF THIS VERY JUST

1048
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:15,806
DELETE.

1049
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,741
YOU REFER TO THE DESIRE TO

1050
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:18,542
GRADUALLY NORMALIZE RATES TO A

1051
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,545
REAL NORMAL LEVEL, WHICH IS

1052
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,448
ABOVE THE RATE WE SEE TODAY.

1053
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:29,019
AND YET, WITH THE DEGREE OF DATA

1054
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,888
AND UNCERTAINTY AROUND WHETHER

1055
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:31,989
THE RECENT DATA IS A TREND OR

1056
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,291
ANOMALY, I WONDER IF YOU COULD

1057
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,025
COMMENT ON THE ABILITY TO

1058
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,095
PROVIDE GUIDANCE THAT IS ANY

1059
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:38,896
MORE FORWARD-LOOKING THAN TWO OR

1060
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,030
THREE WEEKS BASED ON THE DATA

1061
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,031
COMING TO THE COMMITTEE?

1062
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:47,071
CHAIR YELLEN: LET ME START BY

1063
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:47,905
SAYING THE COMMITTEE FREQUENTLY

1064
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:48,739
REFERS TO THIS PROCESS OF

1065
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,608
NORMALIZING RATES.

1066
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,408
I THINK MAYBE IT IS USEFUL TO

1067
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:56,580
MAKE CLEAR THAT THAT IS NOT SOME

1068
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,982
INDEPENDENT GOAL OF MONETARY

1069
00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,917
POLICY THAT WE HAVE FULL

1070
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,586
EMPLOYMENT, PRICE STABILITY, AND

1071
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:06,257
NORMALIZATION OF RATES.

1072
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,025
MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I

1073
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:13,097
BELIEVE, IN A PRETTY NORMAL

1074
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,365
ECONOMY, IT IS LIKELY TO BE

1075
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:16,133
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A HIGHER

1076
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,835
LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES, PERHAPS

1077
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:22,072
NOT THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE, BUT

1078
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:22,840
SOMETHING HIGHER THAN WHAT WE

1079
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,209
HAVE HAD IN RECENT YEARS.

1080
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:30,647
EVEN THAT -- WHAT IS A NORMAL

1081
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:31,381
LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES IN A

1082
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:34,618
NORMAL ECONOMY?

1083
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,486
I TRIED TO EMPHASIZE, LET ME SAY

1084
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:39,156
AGAIN -- IT IS SOMETHING OVER

1085
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,758
WHICH WE HAVE TO BE UNCERTAIN.

1086
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,558
THERE HAVE BEEN SHIPS IN THE

1087
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:42,426
ECONOMY.

1088
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:46,263
I THINK THE CURRENT LEVEL OF

1089
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:46,997
NEUTRAL OR NORMAL RATES IS

1090
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,167
PRETTY LOW.

1091
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,034
NOW, I DO BELIEVE THAT WILL TEND

1092
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,237
TO RISE OVER TIME, WHICH IF IT

1093
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,674
DOES, MEANS INTEREST RATES WOULD

1094
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,275
APPROPRIATELY FOR THE ECONOMY

1095
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,545
MOVE FURTHER UP, BUT I HAVE TO

1096
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,681
SAY, THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE

1097
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,450
UNCERTAIN ABOUT AND HAVE TO FIND

1098
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,719
OUT OVER TIME.

1099
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:14,424
WITH RESPECT TO FORWARD GUIDANCE

1100
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:15,192
, I KNOW MARKET PARTICIPANTS

1101
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:15,993
REALLY WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

1102
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,461
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1103
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,730
[LAUGHTER]

1104
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,000
IT IS ONLY ON RARE OCCASIONS

1105
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,834
WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE

1106
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,704
THAT KIND OF GUIDANCE.

1107
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:30,908
THERE IS, AS I SAID, ABOUT 18

1108
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,043
TIMES, NO PRESET PLAN.

1109
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:33,877
WE LOOK AT DATA AND WE HAVE TO

1110
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:38,882
RETHINK THE OUTLOOK CONSTANTLY.

1111
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:39,683
IN LIGHT OF THE CHANGED OUTLOOK,

1112
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:42,119
REEVALUATE.

1113
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:42,953
I REALLY THINK THE BEST WAY WE

1114
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:48,158
CAN LEGITIMATELY DO IS EXPLAIN

1115
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,159
WHAT FACTORS ARE GUIDING OUR

1116
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:49,626
THINKING.

1117
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,728
WE DO PROVIDE DETAILED

1118
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:54,464
INFORMATION EVERY THREE MONTHS.

1119
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:57,134
EACH PARTICIPANT -- AND THIS IS

1120
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,670
NOT A COMMITTEE VIEW -- BUT ALL

1121
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,141
17 PARTICIPANTS WRITE DOWN THEIR

1122
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:04,942
ASSESSMENTS FOR THE LIKELY PATH

1123
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,978
OF GDP GROWTH, INFLATION,

1124
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,914
UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THE PATH OF

1125
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,817
POLICY OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS

1126
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,685
THAT THEY THINK GOES ALONG WITH

1127
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,321
THAT AND IS APPROPRIATE.

1128
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,323
I THINK THAT IS A LOT OF

1129
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:19,857
INFORMATION.

1130
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,726
THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT, BUT

1131
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:26,129
LOOKING AT THE CENTRAL TENDENCY,

1132
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:29,133
THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF VIEWS.

1133
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,802
BUT AGAIN, THOSE VIEWS CHANGE,

1134
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,270
THEY ARE NOT FIXED.

1135
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,339
WE WILL NEVER SAY LOOK AT THE

1136
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,073
PATH WE RUN DOWN IN MARCH.

1137
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,474
THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1138
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,242
WE CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BE

1139
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:42,045
REACTING TO NEW DATA AND

1140
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:42,746
RETHINKING AND QUESTIONING

1141
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:49,253
THINGS WE THOUGHT PREVIOUSLY.

1142
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:53,323
I THINK, DURING THE DEPTH OF THE

1143
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,226
CRISIS, WE DID PROVIDE SOME MORE

1144
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,596
CONCRETE FORWARD GUIDANCE.

1145
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:00,464
WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO

1146
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,833
DO THAT.

1147
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,101
FOR EXAMPLE, WE GAVE VARIOUS

1148
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:08,171
DATES AND SAID IT WOULD BE

1149
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:09,973
UNLIKELY WE PROBABLY DID THIS IN

1150
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,309
2011, 2012.

1151
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,444
THAT WE WOULD BE RAISING THE

1152
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:18,649
FUNDS RATE BEFORE MID-2013,

1153
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,583
2015, OR BEFORE THE UNEMPLOYMENT

1154
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:27,257
RATE DECLINED BELOW 6.5%.

1155
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,091
WE HAD THE VIEW THAT THIS WAS A

1156
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:29,493
VERY UNUSUAL DOWNTURN, THAT IT

1157
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:35,632
WOULD BE LONG-LASTING, AND THAT

1158
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:36,400
WE WOULD NEED TO HOLD INTEREST

1159
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,567
RATES AT VERY LOW LEVELS FOR AN

1160
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:43,674
UNUSUALLY LONG PERIOD OF TIME,

1161
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,243
AND WITHOUT MAKING A PROMISE,

1162
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,110
WERE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THAT

1163
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:47,644
VIEW TO MARKETS.

1164
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,913
IT HELPED BECAUSE IT BROUGHT

1165
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,381
DOWN LONGER-TERM INTEREST RATES,

1166
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,751
WHICH HELPED THE ECONOMY, BUT

1167
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,652
THAT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL PERIOD.

1168
00:45:55,652 --> 00:46:00,991
>> ONE LAST QUESTION OVER HERE.

1169
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,494
>> THANK YOU FOR COMING.

1170
00:46:04,494 --> 00:46:06,930
BEING RETIRED, BEING AN EXTREME

1171
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,702
LEHMAN INTO MY ECONOMICS, AND

1172
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:12,502
LISTENING TO ALL OF THE MORNING

1173
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:13,804
SHOWS ON SUNDAYS, AND ALL THE

1174
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:18,308
CABLE SHOWS, NOT HAVING ANY

1175
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,042
PARTICULAR INTEREST OF THE

1176
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,911
CANDIDATES, EXCEPT IN ECONOMICS

1177
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,982
AND MY RETIREMENT, THEY HAVE

1178
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:28,018
MENTIONED, IF THE REPUBLICAN

1179
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,953
CANDIDATE BECOMES PRESIDENT OF

1180
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,090
THE UNITED STATES, THAT THERE IS

1181
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:33,857
A POSSIBILITY OF AN ECONOMIC

1182
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,826
CRASH ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE

1183
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:39,096
OF THE WORLD VIEWING DONALD

1184
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:42,299
TRUMP, HOW THEY VIEW DONALD

1185
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:42,699
TRUMP.

1186
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,034
IS THIS A POSSIBILITY?

1187
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:47,171
[LAUGHTER]

1188
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:51,375
CHAIR YELLEN: I'M SORRY.

1189
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,444
I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU ON THAT.

1190
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,280
WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON DOING OUR

1191
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,616
JOBS.

1192
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:00,350
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1193
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,118
[APPLAUSE]

1194
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:08,358
>> THANK YOU.

1195
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,162
SCARLET: THIS CONCLUDES IN JANET

1196
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:16,767
YELLEN'S Q&A SESSION IN

1197
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:17,267
PHILADELPHIA.

1198
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:17,868
GREAT LAST QUESTION.

1199
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,404
MIKE: DONALD TRUMP HAS ALSO SAID

1200
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,206
THAT HE WOULD REPLACE HER, SO

1201
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:24,041
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHE COULD

1202
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:24,775
TAKE PERSONALLY BUT DID NOT.

1203
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,211
SHE JUST DODGED THE QUESTION.

1204
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:31,348
ALIX: OVERALL, WE JUST GOT THE

1205
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,717
TEXT OF HER STATEMENT.

1206
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:34,484
YOUR RESPONSE WAS THIS WAS

1207
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,319
TOWING THE PARTY LINE MORE THAN

1208
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,722
ANTICIPATED.

1209
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:39,523
DO YOU SEE THAT ONCE SHE GOT

1210
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,424
INTO TALKING?

1211
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:44,461
MIKE: BASICALLY, A REPEAT OF

1212
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,296
WHAT SHE SAID IN HARVARD,

1213
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,599
WITHOUT THE DATES.

1214
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,500
NOW WE HAVE THIS WILD CARD OF A

1215
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,268
WEAKER LABOR MARKET, AND DOES

1216
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,104
THAT CONTINUE?

1217
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:54,905
SO WE WANT TO SPREAD OUT WHAT

1218
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,840
OUR POSSIBILITIES ARE.

1219
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,676
IT DOES MEAN JUNE IS OFF THE

1220
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,078
TABLE, WHICH SHE WOULD NEED IT

1221
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:05,749
TO HAVE ENDORSE, IN ORDER TO

1222
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:06,416
HAVE THEM BE A REALISTIC

1223
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,085
POSSIBILITY.

1224
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:08,852
JULY COULD BE ON THE TABLE

1225
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,021
DEPENDING ON THE DATA.

1226
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:11,855
SEPTEMBER, CERTAINLY THEY WILL

1227
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,191
WATCH.

1228
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,025
SHE IS THINKING THE ECONOMY IS

1229
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:15,692
GETTING BETTER.

1230
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:19,696
HER FRAME OF REFERENCE IS

1231
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:20,397
PROBABLY AN ECONOMY THAT

1232
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,165
DESERVES HIGHER RATES.

1233
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:22,999
THE QUESTION IS, DOES THE DATA

1234
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:23,667
SUPPORT THAT?

1235
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:28,572
ALIX: INVESTORS SEEM PESSIMISTIC

1236
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:28,905
.

1237
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:29,806
TAKE A LOOK AT THE BLOOMBERG.

1238
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:32,375
AS WE SAW JANET YELLEN SPEAK,

1239
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,478
YOU SAW THE ODDS EVERY JULY RATE

1240
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,014
HIKE MOVE LOWER, 29%.

1241
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:42,118
IN JUNE, FORGET ABOUT IT.

1242
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:43,687
THERE IS NO 50% OR MORE

1243
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:44,554
EXPECTATION OF A RATE HIKE UNTIL

1244
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:44,988
DECEMBER.

1245
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:49,793
MIKE: WHAT WAS INTERESTING, SHE

1246
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,228
SORT OF REFERENCED IN THAT WHEN

1247
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,028
SHE SAID PEOPLE IN THE MARKETS

1248
00:48:52,028 --> 00:48:52,796
WANT TO KNOW THE EXACT TIME AND

1249
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:53,530
DATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUALLY

1250
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,966
DISAPPOINT THEM.

1251
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,734
I DON'T HAVE AN ARGUMENT WITH

1252
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,169
THE 2% FOR JUNE.

1253
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,904
PROBABLY OFF THE TABLE, BUT YOU

1254
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,106
WATCH THE JULY AND SEPTEMBER

1255
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:03,507
FIGURES.

1256
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,241
THEY WILL MOVE AROUND AS THE

1257
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,311
DATA COMES IN.

1258
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,178
AND DON'T FORGET, SHE HAS A

1259
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,080
PRESS CONFERENCE AND THEN SHE

1260
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:15,619
TESTIFIES TO CONGRESS.

1261
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,486
CONGRESS WANT TO GET OUT OF TOWN

1262
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,988
SO THEY CAN CAMPAIGN.

1263
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:20,590
SO WE WILL BE SEEING A LOT OF

1264
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,391
JANET YELLEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE

1265
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:21,791
OF WEEKS.

1266
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:22,559
THOSE NUMBERS COULD MOVE AROUND

1267
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,093
A LOT.

1268
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:27,063
SCARLET: ON OUR BLOOMBERG

1269
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:27,831
FUNCTION, ONE OF THE COMMENTS

1270
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:33,937
THAT WE HAVE COMPILED,  A HUGE

1271
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,039
CONTRAST BETWEEN THE WAY JANET

1272
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:39,009
YELLEN SPEAKS, HER TONE, AND

1273
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,077
THAT OF ONE OF HER PREDECESSORS,

1274
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:41,611
ALAN GREENSPAN.

1275
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:47,284
JANET YELLEN'S OVERALL STANCE IS

1276
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:47,884
WE DON'T KNOW.

1277
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,219
GREENSPAN WAS, WE KNOW.

1278
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,754
DIFFERENT ECONOMIC PERIOD, BUT

1279
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:54,057
IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE

1280
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:54,891
MARKETS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS

1281
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:55,525
IDEA OF WAIT AND SEE.

1282
00:49:55,525 --> 00:50:00,163
MIKE: THE FED HAS CHANGED ITS

1283
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,566
POLICY FROM BEING PROACTIVE TO

1284
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:08,605
PREACTIVE.

1285
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,472
THEY ARE FOLLOWING DATA NOW MORE

1286
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:11,742
THAN GETTING AHEAD OF IT.

1287
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:12,542
YOU ALSO HAVE A CHANGE IN THE

1288
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,243
PERSONALITY OF THE CHAIR.

1289
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:17,047
JANET YELLEN WAS ASKED, HOW

1290
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:17,814
IMPORTANT ARE YOU IN THE GRAND

1291
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:23,086
SCHEME OF THINGS?

1292
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:23,887
WITH ALAN GREENSPAN, EVERYBODY

1293
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:26,323
KNEW WHAT HE WANTED.

1294
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:29,226
SHE SAID SHE HAS NEVER HAD THREE

1295
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:34,364
DISSENTS SINCE SHE WAS CHAIR.

1296
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,299
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TIME TO 2011

1297
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,100
THE LAST TIME THERE WERE THREE.

1298
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,937
ALIX: TAKE A LOOK AT WITH THE

1299
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:41,805
MARKETS ARE DOING, ESPECIALLY IN

1300
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,840
THE YIELD MARKET.

1301
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,708
JULIE HYMAN HAS A CHECK ON SOME

1302
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,242
OF THE MOVERS.

1303
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,310
JULIE: WHEN WE WERE FIRST

1304
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,980
TALKING AT THE BEGINNING, WHEN

1305
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,181
THEY GOT THE HEADLINES, BEFORE

1306
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,718
SHE SPOKE, WE SAW A LITTLE BIT

1307
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,353
OF A SPIKE IN THE YIELD OF THE

1308
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:59,022
TWO-YEAR.

1309
00:50:59,022 --> 00:50:59,823
THEN IT CAME DOWN TO WHERE IT

1310
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:00,590
WAS BEFORE THE SPEECH.

1311
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,226
STILL AN INCREASE IN YIELD BUT

1312
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,595
NOT A FURTHER INCREASE.

1313
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,864
0.8%.

1314
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:11,668
TAKE A LOOK AT THE U.S. DOLLAR.

1315
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,937
THE BLOOMBERG DOLLAR INDEX.

1316
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:14,704
WE SAW IN SLIDE AS SHE WAS

1317
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:15,972
TALKING.

1318
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:16,773
IT HAD BEEN HIGHER BUT NOT BY

1319
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:20,143
MUCH.

1320
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:20,977
NOW LOWER ON THE DAY VERSUS A

1321
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:21,678
BASKET OF CURRENCIES.

1322
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:28,385
ALSO, I HAVE BEEN WATCHING WIRP,

1323
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,020
WATCHING THE CURVE OF

1324
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,720
POSSIBILITIES FOR WHAT MAY

1325
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,222
HAPPEN LATER IN THE YEAR.

1326
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,089
2% IS NOW THE AUNT FOR THE JUNE

1327
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,825
MEETING.

1328
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,860
25.5% FOR JULY.

1329
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,795
THEN ALL THE WAY OUT TO DECEMBER

1330
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,964
BEFORE YOU GET 61% FOR THAT

1331
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:41,898
MEETING.

1332
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:46,136
QUICK CHECK ON GOLD.

1333
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:46,936
A LOT OF VOLATILITY WHILE SHE

1334
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:49,139
WAS SPEAKING.

1335
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:49,906
STILL UP BY A THIRD OF 1%.

1336
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,842
SCARLET: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF

1337
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:53,543
THE EQUITIES MARKET?

1338
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:59,382
JULIE: NOT SEEING A LOT OF

1339
00:51:59,382 --> 00:51:59,783
CHANGE.

1340
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,550
ALL THREE MAJOR AVERAGES ARE UP

1341
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,851
ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT AS THEY

1342
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:03,053
WERE BEFORE SHE BEGAN TALKING.

1343
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,722
PARTICULARLY, THE DOW IS UP

1344
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:11,160
EXACTLY THE SAME.

1345
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,995
OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY, YOU

1346
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:12,829
HAVE A BETTER PICTURE OF WHAT WE

1347
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,331
HAVE SEEN.

1348
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,532
A DECLINE GOING INTO HER

1349
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,333
COMMENTS AND THEN COMING BACK

1350
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,134
AGAIN.

1351
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:21,471
JUST A STEADY MESSAGE IS WHAT

1352
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,138
THE MARKET SEEMS TO BE

1353
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,173
EXPRESSING.

1354
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,009
ALSO, GROUPS ON THE MOVE

1355
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,277
REMAINING RELATIVELY STABLE.

1356
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:31,748
COMMODITY-L HE.

1357
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:32,615
ENERGY, MATERIAL, FINANCIALS ALL

1358
00:52:32,615 --> 00:52:34,518
IN THE TOP SPOT.

1359
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,587
UTILITIES ARE NOW DECLINING.

1360
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,421
THEY TEND TO GO DOWN WHEN WE SEE

1361
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,725
YIELD GO UP.

1362
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:42,459
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A

1363
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,829
SURPRISE MOVE.

1364
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,696
