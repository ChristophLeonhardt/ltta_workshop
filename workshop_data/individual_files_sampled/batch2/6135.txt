investigators in New York were planning on arresting Harvey Weinstein on Friday however new reports indicate that Weinstein plans on turning himself in now there have been numerous investigations into Harvey Weinstein and the accusations of sexual misconduct that have been launched against him lawmakers in or I should say investigators in New York wanted to do their own investigation and they found enough evidence to arrest him and instead of arresting him he will turn himself in so there might not be a perp walk yeah so I don't care about the perp walk that's for optics and it helps the careers the prosecutors and the cops who were happened to be at that press conference it humiliates the defendant a little bit more in the case of Harvey Weinstein that would be a good thing but it's not important or necessary and so the most important thing is oh thank god they're gonna charge ya like I'm like what have they been waiting for right and and it turns out to be fair to them probably waiting to put together a really good case before they went charged them but I was a little worried because there was a media talker for example Russell Simmons being charged immediate like well okay but where's Weinstein hey I mean what he is accused of is way worse than almost anyone and so if it seemed that because he was rich and powerful that he was gonna get away with it or like justice delayed like in Cosby's case they finally caught up to him but after decades and decades that would not have been a good enough answer but in this case it turns out they are coming for him and and he knows it now whether he actually gets convicted god knows so he loved the same advantage Oh J did and all the other rich defendants he will get together an enormous team of lawyers and they will fight and fight and they'll try to you know find every loophole etc and then as to whether he actually gets convicted I don't know it's anybody's guess two easy ways for Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
