6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,700

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,349
weight and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just feel like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generally</font>

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,710
really attacking myself and be really

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,970
harsh myself and just be ready

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,140
frustrated that I couldn't find

videos in the past I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

23
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,520
I have I was saving for this since she

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">told me but this was like a big</font>

25
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,750
ridiculous job and I do not do not do

26
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,090
this don't don't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm really</font>

27
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,890
excited to show you what I got so let's

28
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,660
get started so a key piece was of course

29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dress and I finally found one in</font>

30
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,960
Selfridges with the help of a very very

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,730
wonderful shop assistant who basically

32
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,350
became my personal chauffeur for like an

33
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,329
hour we ended up on this dress which has

34
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,910
to kind of hyper realistic prints it's

35
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,400
by clover<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canyon which is an LA brand</font>

36
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,460
and everything is made in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

37
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,770
well so it's all good stuff there it's

38
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,210
really really beautiful and it's got

39
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,450
pockets as well just love pockets it

40
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,040
falls very nicely it's very comfortable

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,420
in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways it's very similar to</font>

42
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,740
this mink pink dress that I'm wearing

43
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,479
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> big thing for me has always</font>

44
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,700
been so I was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low girl kind of</font>

45
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">light easy fabrics maybe layering if</font>

46
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,930
necessary but just something just floats

47
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,729
and feels very comfortable then the

48
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,110
second thing for me was the shoes i

49
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,610
asked the shop assistants advice and she

50
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,750
said get something pretty bright

51
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,700
probably an orange they took her advice

52
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,430
it took it these are kg by kurt geiger

53
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,350
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i find Kurt Geiger shoes incredibly</font>

54
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,579
comfortable they're brilliant lesser

55
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,500
light bright and colorful and I don't

56
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,850
think looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the little screen right</font>

57
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,189
now it's really hard to properly convey

58
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,200
exactly how orange they are but I think

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,399
you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impression my</font>

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,840
necklace is from the wonderful company

61
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,490
made and I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of maids</font>

62
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,590
jewelry is handcrafted in Kenya they

63
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,960
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> train women</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Kenya to make</font>

64
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,570
jewelry and they give them proceeds from

65
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,189
the jewelry as well and it's it's a

66
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,210
really high-quality high-quality

67
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,040
products so even though it's apparently

68
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,119
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be 20 degrees centigrade</font>

69

71

72
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,730

73
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,350
