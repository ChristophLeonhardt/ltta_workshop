OPINION HOLDING THAT PHILLIPS

20
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,854
NEVER GOT A FAIR SHAKE WHEN HE

21
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:37,589
WAS SUED BY A GAY COUPLE AFTER

22
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,391

PHILLIPS' EXPLANATION AND

31
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:52,971
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS TO THOSE WHO

32
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,274
SUPPORTED SLAVERY AND THE

33
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:56,041
HOLOCAUST.

34
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,843
"THIS SENTIMENT IS INAPPROPRIATE

35
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,378
FOR COMMISSION CHARGED WITH THE

36
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:01,413
SOLEMN RESPONSE WILL BE A FAIR

AND NEUTRAL ENFORCEMENT OF

38
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:03,982
COLORADO'S ANTIDISCRIMINATION

46
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:16,762
KENNEDY HIMSELF NOTED THAT THE

47
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:17,996
BROADER LEGAL ISSUES IN THIS

48
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,565
DISPUTE ARE FAR FROM SETTLED.

49
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:22,034
I MUST BE DONE SO WITH TOLERANCE

50
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:24,569
FOR BOTH SIDES BECOME A LIVING

>> WE ARE CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTED

54
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:30,776
THAT THE SUPREME COURT FOUND IN

00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:32,511
THIS NARROW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES

56
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:34,012
IN FAVOR OF THE BAKER.

57
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:38,750
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS A

58
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,384
SUPREME COURT IN NO WAY

59
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:40,585
UNDERMINED OUR NATION CIVIL

60
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:40,986

AND UNFAIR TREATMENT WILL

67
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:50,963
CONTINUE.

68
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,631
WE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING UNTIL

69
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,599
NO ONE DOES."

70
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,568
IN JUSTICE GINSBURG'S DISSENT,

71
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:58,370
JOINED BY JUSTICE TOTAL MAYOR,

72
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,672
SHE FOUND IT IRRELEVANT THAT

73
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:02,174
PHILLIPS SOLD CAKES AND COOKIES

74
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:03,075
TO AND CUSTOMERS DESPITE THE

75
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:04,576
FACT THAT HE WOULD NOT CREATE

76
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:08,013
CUSTOM WEDDING CAKES FOR THEM,

77
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:09,648
ADDING "I SEE NO REASON WHY THE

00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:11,116
COMETS OF ONE OR TWO

79
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,318
COMMISSIONER SHOULD BE TAKEN TO

80
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:14,786
OVERCOME PHILLIPS REFUSAL TO

81
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,421
SELL A WEDDING CAKE."

82
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,225
BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT TODAY'S

83
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,194
OPINIONS DOES NOT SETTLE THE

84
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:22,527
ISSUES.

85
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:23,195
THE JUSTICES WILL CONSIDER

86
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:25,097
WHETHER OR NOT TO HEAR THE CASE

87
00:02:25,097 --> 00:00:00,000
OF A WASHINGTON STATE FLORIST
