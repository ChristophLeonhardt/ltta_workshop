UNITED STATES TRAVEL, BUT THEN

26
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,197
YOU PUT ON THE ADDED LAYER OF

27
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:48,365
SECURITY REQUIRED WHEN THE

28
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,367
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA TRAVELS.

29
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:51,635
KIM JONG UN TOUCHED DOWN HERE A

30
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,335
SHORT WHILE AGO.

31
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,037
WHEN HE LANDED IN SINGAPORE, IT

32
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:55,372
WAS THE THIRD COUNTRY THAT KIM

33
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:57,140
HAS BEEN TO SINCE ASSUMING

34
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,742
LEADERSHIP OF NORTH KOREA IN

MOON JAE-IN.

41
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,719
SO IT IS UNUSUAL FOR A NORTH

42
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,121
KOREAN LEADER TO BE SO FAR FROM

43
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:12,422

THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,960
KOREA CHOSE SINGAPORE IN PART

48
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,395
BECAUSE IT HAS HOSTED

49
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:19,529
INTERNATIONAL SUMMITS BEFORE.

50
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,930
THEY'VE GOT THE SECURITY ROUTINE

51
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,231
DOWN.

52
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:24,100
AND TO BE HONEST, THE ROUTINING

53
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,935
SECURITY HERE IS ALREADY ROBUST.

54
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:27,637
THE COUNTRY HAS CLOSED CERTAIN

55
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:29,205
AREAS OF THE CITY, AND THERE IS

56
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:30,073
TIGHT SECURITY THROUGHOUT MUCH

57
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,207
OF IT.

58
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,776

00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:39,082
PROPERTY.

63
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,117
THE PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG UN

64
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,886
WILL MEET ON A SECLUDED,

65
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:44,220
EXCLUSIVE RESORT HERE ON AN

66
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,222
ISLAND JUST OFF THE COAST OF

67
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:47,357
MAINLAND SINGAPORE.

68
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,858
AS FOR THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS

69
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,026
SUMMIT AND WHAT WOULD QUALIFY AS

70
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,494
A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT, WELL, THE

71
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:52,862
PRESIDENT SAYS THAT IT COULD BE

72
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,930
ANYWHERE FROM JUST ESTABLISHING

73
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,532
A GOOD RAPPORT, A GOOD

74
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,200
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN TO

75
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,201
SOMETHING BIGGER THAN THAT.

76
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,036
SO THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTED THAT

77
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,771
IF HE FEELS THIS SUMMIT WILL NOT

78
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,343
BE A SUCCESS, THAT HE WILL NOT

79
00:02:06,343 --> 00:00:00,000
WASTE HIS TIME, NOR KIM JONG
