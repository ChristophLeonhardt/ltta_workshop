setback in talks between the u.s. and North Korea also came up in a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel macron at the st. Petersburg International Economic Forum earlier Kim jong-un on his part did everything he promised before even blow up the tunnels and the silos on his test site and after that we heard about the cancellation of the summit what I would really want is for that process already underway to decrease tensions on the peninsula as well as the process of denuclearization and disarmament of the Pinscher for that process to continue Petrenko is in st. Petersburg as well following what the Russian leaders meeting with French president when Mike first when Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel macron appeared in front of TV cameras there was none of this Trump get-together style tapping on the shoulder and other things and it seemed that the leaders of Russia and friends were gonna get away with some traditional diplomatic language when they were gonna talk to the journalists however when the press conference began surprisingly I guess Emmanuel macron speech started to resemble a love letter to Russia the French president spoke for more than four times longer than his Russian counterpart mr. macron also showed off his affection for the big names in Russian literature like Dostoyevsky or Solzhenitsyn and he even paid special attention to remembering the victims of the so-called Leningrad blockade during the Second World War this was of course one of the tragedies in this city st. Petersburg known as Leningrad in the USSR besides this Emmanuel macron addressed the Russian president as share Vladimir or dear vladimer instead of mr. Putin at the beginning of what he was saying but it wasn't just about how many nice things quite surprisingly mr. macron said about Russia the presidents of Russia talked about so much and brought up so many things I'll just give you a list Syria Iran Ukraine cybersecurity the Korean crisis sanctions multipolar world freedom of speech and even football but I'll come back to that a bit later among other things the leaders of the two countries agreed in the next few weeks to come up with a mechanism to bring the competing Syria peace talk platforms together plus they want to work hand and glove to save the Iranian nuclear deal which Donald Trump has just dumped also Emmanuel macron said it out loud Russia's international role in numerous regions and conflicts needs to be praised I do acknowledge Russia has increased its role on the international arena in particular the Middle East the newly gained role of leader comes with responsibilities and I'm well aware of the role Russia plays resolving various international conflicts the presidents of France and Russia came out to talk to the journalists about two hours later than they were expecting to do in the first place and surely that was because they had many things to discuss but also I believe the reason for it is the lavish dinner that they were having I just want to give you some of the things that were on their menu pancakes with caviar as well as a crab starter than a traditional Russian soup but with a French twist also sturgeon steak and venison was the main course and that was all topped off with chocolate cake for dessert and I just want to go back to the first seconds of the summit when Emmanuel macron left his limo he was hugged by Vladimir Putin who also prepared a bouquet of flowers for macrons wife Bridget who according to the format of this official visit wasn't even supposed to come to Russia but she did from the start of it to the very end one of the journalists asked Emmanuel macron if he was ready to come back to Russia in a month to support the French national team and here's what we heard from france's leader in the end I hope to travel here to support our football team France makes it to the quarter-final I'll definitely be here to support it I'm optimistic by Nature and then we'll meet again with President Putin you
