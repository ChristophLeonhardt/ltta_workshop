few minutes from now because it's just so glorious first I want to discuss my old boss Steve Bannon who apparently has lost whatever was left of his marbles after he left the White House Steve has been trotting around globe-trotting going to hot spots like Alabama said he could talk with people about the glories of Rome or sticking his reporters from Breitbart news on unsuspecting alleged victims of child molestation while his own editor Alex Marlow was telling the press openly that he believed the victims but they still had to investigate because they needed protect Trump or something in any case Steve Allen did an interview with an author named Michael Wolfe I don't know what's going through bannon's head at this point except that he's basically lost all connection with the White House as far as I know he's lost all connection with his money in the Mercer family as far as I know and that means that he is sort of adrift in the world the reason that this is important is because when the media say today that a new controversy has arisen because of Steve Bannon where that Steve Bannon has the secret sauce he knows all of the evils inside the Trump administration when they say that he has started a new controversy understand Steve Bannon is desperate for relevance Steve Bannon is not a major player on the American political scene anymore despite the media's wishes for him to be so-and-so whatever he has to say about what's going on with regard to Trump Russia collusion you got to take it with a grain of salt now maybe it'll turn out that there's a smoking gun maybe it'll turn out there was some fire there and there was actual collusion so far I have seen nothing of the sort so far it seems like this is a lot of overblown rhetoric and maybe some stupidity from people like Carter Page and George papadopolis but I really have seen nothing so far that suggests in any significant way that Trump Russia campaign collusion was a thing well the media are jumping on bannon's comments today because Bannon suggests the opposite so on Wednesday former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon who apparently upon leaving the White House the phone bill to the New York Times has gone down dramatically because Steve was good friends some of the folks over there he tore into his former boss President Trump the man who made him famous as well as Trump's son Donald Jr his son-in-law Jared Kushner as well so basically all of his enemies inside the administration namely all of the Trump kids he ripped into and then he knocked Trump as well and then because Steve is just an unguided missile he also back handedly swiped his own publication Breitbart news which was the part I found kind of hilarious so here's what he said he spoke with the author Michael Wolfe from Wolf's new book that book has now been reported by the Guardian the UK Guardian which is a far left in newspaper which shows you Steve has a real tendency to talk to you the American Prospect and the Guardian and the New York Times you know all the fake news media that he used to cry Bannen told Wolff that Robert Muller's investigation would quote crack down jr. like an egg on national TV this is a he only speaks in metaphors from a Martin Scorsese film as I think it's Josh hammer pointed or us even though the fact is that everything that he says is a dramatic line from a bad film everything Bannon says so Bannon says that they will crack down jr. like an egg on national TV which would be weird because that's a crime he then stated it Donald Donald juniors campaign meeting with lawyer associated with the Russian government you remember Don junior back during the campaign had a meeting with a Russian lawyer named vessel Nix kaya and she came to Trump Tower and she met with some members of the campaign the members of the campaign basically blew her off blew Don jr. off and despite his willingness to hear information about Hillary Clinton no information actually exchanged hands as far as we know and Trump himself was not personally involved as far as we know in any case here's what Bannon said he said Donald juniors campaign meeting with that lawyer was quote treasonous or unpatriotic or bad bleep and added that Trump jr. and associates should have called the FBI immediately now this is weird you might say to yourself wait Steve Danon weren't you part of the campaign if you had known about this shouldn't you have called the FBI well Steve banned and joined the campaign in August this happened in July so he wasn't there for several months I guess or at least a couple of months before any of this but what when any of this was happening which means he has no special inside information but he'd found out about it shouldn't even call the FBI but he didn't and then he went on 60 minutes while he was working for the White House you remember when we had Trenton when we had banded on the cover of Time magazine and he called the Russia investigation of farce in a waste of time remember he said this on 60 minutes and everybody said look at Steve Bannon out there defending his boss well now he says that his boss a traitor and the Trump campaign was treasonous so just as soon as Steve Bannon becomes an irrelevant Lord of nothing just as Steve bannon's massive power devolves into just the bag of hot gas that he is then all of a sudden he's back out front saying that Trump is guilty of treason right into the media of jump down this is both feet off Steve Bannon must know he was there he panthan know anything didn't know anything the other reason the Steve ban was on the campaign is because the Mercer money was behind him that's the only reason Kellyanne Conway was on the campaign I know I was there okay the only reason that Steven was in the White House is because the Mercer money who's immediately shelved in a tiny office off the Oval Office with a white board filled with Trump promises that Trump had not yet fulfilled and that Bannon would leak about to the New York Times every so often any case it doesn't stop there if you're fan you should be pissed to see Bannon today because Steve Bannon just made trouble for Trump in the middle of Trump actually trying to push some good policy so Bannon went on to tell wolf that's such a meeting should have occurred quote in a Holiday Inn in Manchester need to New Hampshire with your lawyers who meet with these people and information should then have been dumped down to Breitbart or something like that or maybe some other more legitimate publication so a few things about this are hilarious number one if you just said that it was a treasonous meeting how does it make it not treasonous if your lawyers are in New Hampshire with them and it's still treason so I'm confused about that but my favorite thing by far in this interview his war ban and says that the information from the Russians should have been dumped down to Breitbart right first of all implying the Breitbart was basically a vehicle for the Trump administration and the Trump campaign which it was and that they should have acted illegally or at least colluded with the Russians that Trump should have used Breitbart as basically a go-between with the Russian government which is incredible admission and then finally the admission that maybe they should have dumped that information to some other more legitimate publications this ban and who is the chairman of Breitbart news calling his own publication illegitimate so well done Steve just remember this guy's Darth Vader remember he's the great genius he's the great the great unbreakable brilliant honey badger who was behind the Trump campaign uh-huh or is it possible he's just a doof is it just possible he's a loudmouth doof and the media treat him as something special because they hate Trump and so they want to make it seem like bandhans the real power behind the throne he didn't stop there he says about Jared Kushner quote you realize where this is going this is all about money laundering okay well first of all we knew that already because Kushner was interviewed and they requested bank records so thanks for the revelation Steve he says Muller chose Andrew Weissman a prosecutor first and he has a money laundering guide their path to effing Trump goes right through Paul Manafort town jr. and Jared Kushner it's as plain as a hair on your face it goes through Deutsche Bank and all the cushion of bleep the commissioner bleep is greasy they're gonna go right through that they're gonna roll up those two guys and say play me or trade me they're sitting on a beach trying to stop a category five again everything he says is from a bad movie trailer every single thing Steve Benton has ever said is from a bad movie trailer it's just spectacular and what's so great about this is that Bannon just blew himself up with the people who made him famous now I understand the Bandon thinks he's gonna go with Jovanka right with Jordan Ivanka that's his thing he's gonna go to war with Jordan Ivanka right but no one cares about that no one cares about Steve bannon's little petty internation fights the only thing people care about at least where I come from in the conservative movement is whether Trump gets things done or not whether Trump is winning or not for the policies that we like I don't care whether Trump even personally wins I care whether he does policy that I like yeah but see Bannon is out there making trouble for Trump and now the media are going to jump all over him of course and they're gonna try to turn this into a big story because they've been building up Bannen as something he is not for a long time I have been saying consistently for well over a year now Steve Bannon is not a powerful figure Steve Bannon doesn't know anything Steve Bannon is a leech on the ass of power who rode Michele Bachmann's name to Sarah Palin to Andrew Breitbart who died to Donald Trump to the Mercer family okay that's all that happened here that's all that happened here but the media will jump on this so ignore all the media bloviating about how Trump has abandoned he has the inside scoop he just doesn't okay moving on now we can finally talk about president Trump's magnificent set of tweets last night magnificent okay so I don't know whether Trump just has you know John Adams once said about Alexander Hamilton that Alexander Hamilton had a had in a what was it a plethora of secretions there were not enough Horrors in the world to suck off okay I am not joking that's something that John Adams actually said about Alexander Hamilton I don't know whether Trump just builds up Twitter secretions and then he has to let them off on Twitter I don't know they just he builds up steam and then he has to let it all off on Twitter I'm not sure what the story is there but whatever the story is it's spectacular okay whatever the story is it is it is magical so last night Donald Trump takes to Twitter and nothing prompts this like it wasn't like Kim jong-un did anything or like he tweeted at him or any of that sort of thing instead Donald Trump tweeted this thing and I will read it to you

this out North Korea North Korean leader Kim Jung hoon just stated that the nuclear button is on his desk at all times with someone from his depleted and food stabbed regime please inform him that I to have a nuclear button but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his and my button works amazeballs okay just amazing Donald Trump likes big buttons and he cannot lie that is just that is glorious there is is is it what can you say except we're all going to die so are we actually all going tonight so the media treated it as though we are all going tonight media treated this as though it is the end of the world as we know it and they don't feel fine the media a lot of pop culture references today the media has basically went crazy over this so an MSNBC analyst because this this actually it poses for analysis on MSNBC his name is Anand you read Herodotus she's a name for you and he says that Trump's sexual insecurities are threatening to destroy the planet so Donald Trump is very obsessed with his genital size and therefore he's tweeting this out and then we're all going to die so he's in all in with Chris Hayes talking about again the show is called all in with Chris Hayes and he's talking about sexual insecurity on national TV anyway here is the MSNBC analyst the famed MSNBC analyst anon garage Harada Brad abyss perhaps never have we seen a man whose profound sexual and masculine insecurities are literally threatening to annihilate the planet I mean the way he's literally capitalizing and that tweet is nuclear button I mean any psychiatrist or psychologists would have a field day with that but we all live in a world that could literally be ended in terms of a habitable planet no no it won't no no come on really okay the truth is no one takes from seriously about this stuff no one cares Trump says a lot of crap no one is like really is anybody at this point going yes we're really all going to die and Ross dude had I thought had a great point on Twitter last night if people actually thought that everyone's gonna die don't you think there'll be millions of people in the streets protesting from sweater feed but don't you think that there would be like some people going guys this be crazy right wouldn't there be anybody who's like oh my god bilder what wouldn't wouldn't all of my sponsors who sell survival gear be just doing unbelievably well because of these tweets they're doing unbelievably well because they sponsored with me but wouldn't they be doing unbelievably well because of the survival because of the tweets wouldn't that be what's going on no none of that's happening because no one takes this seriously okay the reality is then if Trump's tweets are gonna have any impact on foreign policy it's not gonna be because of stuff like this okay Jimmy Kimmel though he also goes crazy over this so Pope Jimmy is Mary Katharine ham has termed him he comes out he did not have his son on his hip for this one but he did say that there are two this is this is just insane two maniacs arguing over who has the bigger button he took some time off he almost seems like a new man he's very positive tonight just minutes ago he tweeted North Korean leader Kim Jong hoon just stated that the nuclear button is on his desk at all times well someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a nuclear button but it is a much bigger and more power one than his my button works that's right Happy New Year everybody we have two maniacs with nuclear warheads bragging about who has the bigger button okay so I love this first of all I wish that I had pulled the clip of Willy Wonka saying button button who's got the button because it would be so perfect here but in any case Jimmy Kimmel saying oh it's too many yet but everyone's laughing right that's the point people immediately start laughing when they hear that tweet they don't go oh my god we're all gonna die they go that's kind of funny cuz you know what it's kind of funny it is okay like Trump saying I have a bigger first of all that button on his desk it just brings some Diet Coke guys okay that button is not for the nukes right the phone is for the nukes the button is just for the Diet Coke so we can hope that he doesn't switch the phone in the button right we hope that he doesn't pick up the phone and order himself two diet cokes and people take that as a code right but at the same time come on like this idea that we're all going to die now is it stable behavior is it the kind of behavior that we would wish to see from the president would you expect this from Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln just would would tweet out silly Jefferson Davis I have an enormous army on your doorstep it's long beautiful and hard is that really what you would expect from Abraham Lincoln probably not probably not from Honest Abe it's not what we're used to in the Oval Office Jake Tapper goes after Trump over this yesterday this is the President of the United States issuing a threat to use nuclear weapons and then turning around and glibly chastising the media these tweets coming on the same day the president Trump also suggested that a former Hillary Clinton aide who has been charged with no crime should be jailed and said the former FBI director who was in a witness who is a witness in the investigation into the Trump campaign should be investigated himself and also said that his own Justice Department is part of a conspiracy known as the quote deep State none of this normal none of this acceptable none of this frankly stable behavior okay so this is just like there is that true yeah it's kind of true I mean like is this something you would expect from the president but but this idea that we're all going to die because of it is just not true okay the reality is that if you were going to actually have a situation in which the President of the United States is a threat on foreign policy it would not be because of this right Ronald Reagan back in 1984 I believe during his re-election campaign he was caught on a live mic saying the bombing of the Soviet begins in five minutes right and it's in everybody laughed actually the Soviets took it seriously enough they have to put their bombers on alert because people took Reagan seriously did North Korea put its bombers on alert no North Korea did nothing because no one's taking from seriously on this if there were to be any danger from Trump's Twitter feed its if Trump would start signaling friendliness or apathy toward a regime you should not so for example let's say that Vladimir Putin were to mass a bunch of troops on the border of Estonia or Latvia and Trump were to say well I didn't care about those places I don't even know how to spell them right then you would say okay well now we're on the brink of war right cuz Putin's just gonna walk right across that border knowing Trump's not gonna do anything because even when from Bluffs with fours there's a good shot that the force is never gonna come so if he actually says he doesn't care about something he probably really doesn't care about something but as far as him making militaristic threats like that's what why do you think Trump wanted the job it's just so he could say this kind of stuff it's just so he like Trump does have some deep insecurity right there's no question he he has some some deep insecurity but no one's taking this seriously anymore which is why I tweeted out last night that I think the President Trump should simultaneously launch nuclear weapons at North Korea during the State of the Union address in which is railing about fake news and fire Robert Mueller at the same time then the next day he should start tweeting about why no one is talking about the stock market gains like that seems like that seems like I think the best move for president Trump at this point okay so I'm moving on I want to talk a little bit more about another tweet that President Trump sent out and it is real and it is spectacular it is it is quite grand but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at stamps.com so stamps.com is the place to go

tweet that was sent out yesterday here is another fantastic Trump tweet that was sent out yesterday so Trump tweets out quote I would be announcing all capitals the most dishonest and corrupt media awards of the year on Monday at 5 o'clock subjects will cover dishonesty and bad reporting in various categories from the fake news media stay tuned okay so first of all I continue to enjoy his capitalization habits they are just I don't know it say about them like normally you know you're reading I've been reading a lot of philosophy lately and very often you'll see philosophers use terms that they've coined right you'll you'll see the new manal and the phenomenal and in conte and sometimes in certain editions they will actually capitalize those terms because there are new terms that are being introduced in contracts we do the same thing in contract law whenever we introduce a new term in parentheses we put all caps what the term means right we capitalized it but apparently Trump things he coined the terms dishonesty and bad reporting and from the fake news media and I what I'm hoping is that President Trump actually says that he wants to deliver a nationally televised address and deliver his diatribe against the fake news media on all three networks that would be pretty spectacular and I'll admit I'm gonna tune in on Monday at five o'clock like is he gonna do it on Twitter is it gonna be an actual reality show are they gonna be a Wars presenters is it gonna be like Kim Kardashian walks out who's gonna actually be the emcee is he gonna emcee it himself or is he gonna be the guy who just comes out and it opens up the envelopes I am very curious as to how this is going to go is gonna be Ted Nugent and Sarah Palin in the Oval Office actually making this happen or won't be the mooch I root for the mooch on behalf of Marshall one of the producers here I root for the mooch and I would try to get Marshall front-row seats for the mooch but in any case President Trump going after the fake news media as well again I don't know what's driving these tweets but I can safely say that it's nothing supremely rational he also tweeted about his accomplishments last night and this one was pretty good he he really one on Twitter last night and I like that the president has fun with things he tweeted out president Trump has something now he didn't have a year ago that is a set of accomplishments that nobody can deny the accomplishments are there look at his record he has had a very significant first year and then he quotes it from the Lou Dobbs show David Asman and Ed Rollins so I do love that he is now giving citations so that's exciting um also a few days ago the President of the United States suggested that he did not in fact watch a lot of TV that's not true he watches a lot of TV so here is Trump on Daniel Dale who is a reporter I believe was he for ABC or Axios in any case he he tweets out they he tweeted out Trump's schedule yesterday 11:03 p.m. live tweets fox business 8:16 p.m. urges people to watch fox show 7:49 a I assume these are all I am or I guess the I guess is this the last 24 hours okay 749 p.m. mocks Kim jong-un after Fox segment 959 13 a.m. takes credit for aviation safety after Fox segment 9:08 a.m. talks North Korea after fox segment 849 am tweets about taxes after fox segment 844 am tweets to fox 748 am attacks Justice Department Abaddon after fox segment that also actually I think I missed a couple I think the traumatic a couple of five segments as well I mean at least Fox knows who they're who they're P ones are right in radio you call them the P ones the people who listen to your entire show at least I mean they they know who they're who they are programming to so you know the President of the United States I can't say he's a deeply busy man now look at the good news about this I guess if you're on the left is that he's not busy doing other things like he could be busy paring back regulations and if you're on the right he could be busy doing other things like I guess mouthing off but he is mouthing off so I guess is that all great here is the problem that I'm having a more broad problem I've been talking about this a lot because let's face it it's freaking hilarious I mean it's just funny it's just funny okay if you can't enjoy this then take a chill pill because it is it is it is one of the more enjoyable things in life is watching the President of the United States who seems as though the the music from Benny Hill should be running under the administration continuously here is the problem the actual problem the actual problem is I am now invested in president Trump's policies I like his policies over the last six weeks I've gotten a lot of good policy in the middle of these sweet storms that I've been talking about he tweeted that perhaps he should cut aid to the Palestinian Authority which he should it's a terrorist entity right in the middle of all of this he was saying things that are true about the Middle East and Iran he was tweeting out that the United States was going to support the protesters in Iran all of this is true and good and important now if the President of the United States had but let's say the President of the United States had had been pushing nationalist populist Bandhan ISM an agenda that I didn't like let's say I was pushing a bunch of policy that I thought was bad and then he was doing all of this stuff that was stupid I would say well it's not great the president the United States is doing all that stuff but what he's really doing is he's maligning an agenda that is not my own he's hitting a magenta an agenda and I am not particularly fond of so the impact on that agenda it makes less of a difference to me right if he if he has if he sinks his own infrastructure bill I'm not gonna shed any tears over that but if the President of the United States is pushing policies that I like a lot right as he's been doing for the last six weeks now there's the significant possibility that in 2018 if he loses the house or if he loses the Senate or if things really go to hell in a handbasket he loses in 2020 that it's not just going to be seen as a repudiation of him personally and his Twitter habits it's not just gonna be seen as a repudiation of the of the President of the United States as a human being it will instead be a seen as a repudiation of his policies and my business partner Jeremy boring God king of daily wire Jeremy has been saying this for years about Herbert Hoover what he said about Herbert Hoover is that if you actually look back at Herbert Hoover's record right the president who preceded FDR his record was very much along the lines of FDR's record and he increased government spending he pushed tariffs he increased regulations he was very interventionist in the economy in fact members of the FDR administration said openly that Herbert Hoover's policies were basically the groundwork for their own but then in 1932 and he ran for re-election and afterward he posed himself as a as a real conservative is a guy who wanted small government less government intervention ISM and so Hoover ism became synonymous with conservatism and it's smeared conservatism for a generation a full generation didn't matter that Herbert Hoover wasn't actually conservative his toxicity smeared conservatism even though his own policies not been conservative this is what I fear from Trump and in some ways worse because he's actually implementing policies that I like as I don't have to go through the litany again but in the last month in the last six weeks he has announced the move of the capital of the embassy to Jerusalem in Israel he has gotten his major tax cut which will not be reversed he's nominate a bunch more appellate court judge the judges yesterday at Don Willett and joined the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals which is a fantastic pick ton well it is terrific he has cut regulations at record rates he is he has prevented the establishment of new national monuments and is paring back on some of the old ones because there's too much federal land in the West presidents of the United States has supported the protesters and run all this is good stuff but if the president makes himself toxic and therefore makes his agenda toxic then you do have a much more serious problem on your hands and that is not good okay that's not it's not a good thing that's something that has to stop and so I encouraged the president to go on break and just enjoy himself instead he went around to to Twitter and said things and that's not good again I just want I want the president to be successful for the country and I don't think that these tweets are particularly helpful in that now with that said the President of the United States did tweet something about the deep state yesterday that is not completely inaccurate so here's what he tweeted yesterday tweeted quote crooked Hillary Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols she put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents remember sailors pictures on summer in jail deep State Justice Department must finally act also on Comey and others so what he's suggesting here is that Hillary Clinton's top aide who may Abbadon should go to jail because she actually put a bunch of passwords like government passwords on her yahoo email and that yahoo was then hacked and what trump says that he's comparing this to another case are they of a woman who was jailed she was in the US Navy and she was jailed for taking pictures on submarines and then putting them on social media and this was considered a security breach and she did time in jail and he again is suggesting that the Justice Department is the deep state well the President of the United States the head of the Justice Department he can instruct them to investigate Hillary Clinton in Huma Abedin any time he wants he has not done that instead he prefers to mouth off about it but is it true that the Justice has acted in heretofore bizarre ways and did so while it was under the auspices of the Obama administration has continued to act in I would say slightly less weird ways which have sessions but the Comey investigation Robert Mueller's investigation has acted in strange ways I think that that's unquestionable and in just a second I want to tell you about the situation with Trump Russia and Hillary because there's an op-ed in The New York Times that is quite telling but first Jeffrey Toobin on CNN went off over the deep state here's what he had to say about Trump ripping the so-called deep state again well I think it's pretty reprehensible to use that that phraseology in any event I guess who that refers to or long-serving civil servants career civil servants who are patriots and dedicated to the to the country I'd point out that when you take the oath of office as a civil servant you swear to uphold the Constitution it doesn't say anything about pledging loyalty to this president or any other and if not doing so is what constitutes being part of the South deep State I think that's that's actually James clapper but James clapper you know talking about the deep state this is the problem right when James clapper says that Trump is wrong about the deep state who's gonna trust James clapper about that because James clapper was a motivated part of the so-called deep State when people say deep state I think they're think of something more conspiratorial than is it's just Obama holdovers who have a political agenda and there's no question that there are people in positions of power who do have that agenda again it was the Daily Caller that reported that Abaddon forded her State Department passwords to Yahoo before was hacked by Florida agents Luke Rossi who does some really good investigative reporting over there he's the one who reported on this yesterday he said that you know who by Abaddon regularly forded work email store personal account and then she'd used these accounts if her State account was was down or she need to print an email or document abdun further explained that it was difficult to print from the Department of State system so she routinely forwarded emails to earn on gos system which of course defeats the entire purpose Trump's not wrong to ask questions about the behavior of the Obama administration and the so called deep state during this time I just think that it's not smart of him to tweet it out there plenty of people who can ask those questions for him well in just a second I want to discuss in edie from fusion GPS that a lot of people are apparently suggesting puts an end to all of the blowback on the Mueller team for corruption but it doesn't I'll explain why in just a second first I want to say thank you to our new sponsor is over at wondering there's a new podcast that you just have to listen to it's called American

York Times that the left is trotting out as evidence that the right is conspiratorial in its views of the Mueller investigation so to recap as I said yesterday the right has suggested that there's a serious problem with the FBI investigation into Trump Russia collusion the serious problem is that the fusion GPS dossier that was allegedly used as the basis for FBI attempting to get FISA warrants on Trump administration officials was commissioned by Democrats and was full of crap basically there were Democrats inside the DOJ and the FBI they were politically motivated they got a hold of this dossier from fusion GPS which was a democratic funded Apple Research Group basically and then they used that as an excuse to go after Trump that's the allegation from Republicans well today the the the cofounders of fusion GPS Glenn Simpson and Peter fresh one of whom pled the fifth in front of Congress right they have an op-ed today talking about how fusion GPS has thing to do it that we did nothing wrong and the FBI investigation has nothing to do with fusion GPS etcetera so here's what they write they say a generation ago Republicans sought to protect President Richard Nixon by urging the Senate Watergate committee to look at supposed wrongdoing by Democrats in previous elections the committee chairman Sam Ervin and Democrat said that would be quote as foolish as the man who went bear hunting and stopped to chase rabbits today I'm in a growing and criminal inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election congressional Republicans are again chasing rabbits we know because we are their favorite quarry in the air since the publication of the so-called steel dossier the collection of intelligence reports we commissioned about Donald Trump's ties to Russia the president has repeatedly attacked us on Twitter his allies in Congress have dug through our bank records and sought to tarnish our firm to punish us for highlighting his links to Russia conservative news outlets and even our former employer The Wall Street Journal has spun a succession of mendacious conspiracy theories about our motives and backwards we are happy to correct the record in fact we already have three congressional committees have heard over 21 hours of testimony from our firm fusions ups again they're neglecting to mention several members of fusions UPS pled the fifth they say we walked investigators through a year-long effort to decipher mr. Trump's complex business past of which the steel dossier is but one chapter and we handed over our relevant bank records while drawing the line at a fishing expedition for the records of companies we work for that have nothing to do with the Trump case well they drew they don't really get to decide where they draw the line in a subpoena situation you know one of the questions is who funds you right who bankrolls you the Republicans have refused to release full transcripts of our firms testimony even as they selectively leaked details to media outlets on the far right well I'd like to see them released full transcripts because I'd like to see what was said I would also like to find out who pled the fifth and why they say we don't believe the steel dossier was the trigger for the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling as we told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August our sources said the dossier was taken so seriously because it corroborated reports the bureau had received from other sources including one inside at the Trump camp there are some problems with this particular claim the dossier corroborated reports from other sources they only started monitoring George papadopolis apparently after the Stasi a came out is my understanding of a timeline so I'm not understanding how they could corroborate reports that had already been issued unless those were basically just reportedly Zoar rumors and the intelligence committees have known for months the credible allegations of Clue between the Trump camp and Russia were pouring in from independent sources during the campaign lawmakers in thrall of the president continue to wage a cynical campaign to portray as the unwitting victims of kremlin disinformation and then they say that they'd suggested investigators look into bank records of Deutsche Bank and others funding Trump's business Congress appeared an uninterested in our tip we told Congress that we found widespread evidence that mr. Trump in his organization had worked with a wide array of dubious Russians okay all of that is being investigated by Mueller but I'm just confused in general by this claim that the dossier had nothing to do with the original launch of the of the wiretap on Carter page because there is nothing about George papadopolis that suggests that you actually have to launch a wiretap against Carter page and that's what the FISA warrant was for Carter page was apparently only mentioned in the fusion GPS dossier so again there there's something fishy here I'm not sure that all of this washes for me well meanwhile congressional investigators are saying they found written evidence of criminality in the Clinton probe so according to the hill Republicans on congressional committees conducting their own investigations have obtained highly redacted documents from the FBI that showed the agency did suspect that laws were broken lawmakers say in numerous passages the FBI stated the sheer volume of classified information that flowed to and from the former Secretary of State's unsecured private server was proof of criminality there was also an admission of false statements by a key witness the name of the witness was redacted congressional investigators say it was an employee from the computer firm that maintained Clinton's server after she left the State Department in 2013 so in other words the FBI shut down a fully plausible investigation into Hillary Clinton but launched a really sketchy investigation into Trump Russia again the only indictments that have come down right now are from Mike Flynn on obstructing justice by lying to the FBI and during the transition and George papadopolis who apparently lied to the FBI about reach outs from in London contacts who apparently had contacts with the Russian government right that's that's about all that we have so far from the Mueller investigation well meanwhile the president continues to try to push forward an agenda the Trump is trying to push forward his agenda and that agenda has been slightly hampered by the news that Orrin Hatch is out the senator from Utah who was widely seen as the only barrier between Mitt and the Senate seat in Utah he has decided that he is going to step out of the Senate he's 1,000 years old I believe he may be 1,001 he's he's actually 83 and Orrin Hatch has been in the Senate for 41 years so significantly longer than I have been alive he has actually been in the Senate and hatch is leaving and he also has said that he is fine with Mitt Romney taking over for him Romney who is 70 changed his changed his Twitter profile to highlight the fact that he is located in Holladay Utah so it looks like Romney is likely to run a lot of people in the Trump camp are not happy about this they think that Romney will be a thorn in Trump's side in the same way that Jeff Flake was sort of a thorn in Trump's side again I think that Romney will likely vote a lot of the right way on all of this but I'm confused as to you know I don't know why Romney is necessarily the logical pick I think he'll make a fine senator from Utah I don't see any serious problems there although you know we'll have to go back and rehash his record the guy did invent Obamacare so making him into the greatest Obamacare opponent there's always this revisionist history that goes on after campaigns in 2012 I did not vote for Mitt Romney in the primaries in northern and I endorsed him in the primary specifically because I didn't think he was quite as conservative as he was pledging to be right so I was pretty clear about my doubts about Romney then I think a lot of the passion about Romney now is driven by the fact that he is seen as a counterweight to Trump in reality will he be that he'll say some stuff but will he actually be that not in any way different than Jeff Flake has been which is to say not much what else on the Republican agenda for 2018 well now they're talking about welfare reform so I think Trump is on a different page than some of the members of Congress Trump is talking about immigration per se Steve Scalise who is the House Majority Whip he is saying we're gonna tackle welfare reform next again this would be a greatly necessary change this would be useful well there's a lot that we're going to be doing in 2018 and it starts where we left off tax reform is working incredibly well we're seeing our economy take off the next big thing you're going to see is a need for workers and I think the best thing we can do is to go and reform those welfare programs that are trapping people in a failed welfare state let's actually put some work requirements in place so that we can get people back to work rebuild the middle class okay so this is a useful piece of information Trump is also pushing along an agenda with regard to daca so yesterday I mentioned that Trump didn't seem to have any clear strategy on the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and that's a problem right it seems like he's saying that he's gonna reinstate daca if Democrats don't reach a deal with him which would not be a loss for Democrats it would look like Trump back down it looked like he backed down his base would be angry at him so I'm not sure how that's even close to a negotiation strategy but there are members of Trump administration now who are saying the Trump is not going to sign into law any deal for the dreamers almost it also includes an end to chain migration and what's fascinating is they're sort of a rip that's broken out among Republicans about whether Trump should go for a border funding for the wall or whether he should go for an end to chain migration if you have to pick one you have to go with chair migration mai-chan migration is significantly more of a problem in terms of immigration and illegal immigration then is the border wall itself right we can always staff up ice there is border wall in some places already I I'm in favor of border wall I've always been in favor of a border barrier no question but if you have to choose chain migration is a much greater threat to America's immigration system than is the border wall because that's basically a legal policy that says that if you come in and you get in you now get to bring all of your extended family it turns into fit week the big hearted moves from dr. Seuss I used to bring in everybody on your horns and that that's a huge mistake right the the latest terror attack that we saw in the United States was perpetrated by somebody who got in basically through a chain migration so that that's not a if they're gonna go for something let them go for chain migration I think that's the right move again the American immigration system changed radically in 1965 and it was designed instead of for making America stronger through immigration it was designed instead to be based on empathy for people from various parts of the globe that might be more downtrodden coming from places that were less European in origin places that had typically less of a history of Western civilization and that changed how immigration was done the chain migration system combined with that shift in the place where people come from means that a higher percentage of people are coming from countries that are not used to all of the all of the things that make Western civilization Western civilization so I hope that trump can push that it's one of the reasons why please mr. president stop with the Twitter distractions stop it's just not useful in any real way okay so in just a second I'm gonna do some things I like and some things that I hate but first we're gonna have to say goodbye to you over on Facebook and YouTube so I have Facebook and YouTube if

over there we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation okay time for some things I like him then some things I hate so things I like I'm the President of the United States um I mentioned this amid his tweets yesterday I made the crazy tweets there was a very good tweet okay and the tweet that he put out was with regard to Pakistan and then with regard to the Palestinians here it was - tweet he tweeted quote it's not only Pakistan we paid billions of dollars - for nothing right he cut off military aid to Pakistan which is a good move but also many other countries as well as an example we pay the Palestinians hundreds of millions of dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect they don't even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel we've taken Jerusalem toughest part of the negotiation off the table but Israel for that would have had to pay more than what the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace why should we make any of these massive future payments to them this is a good question we never should have been making these massive future payments to them at all because they are a terrorist group the Palestinian Authority is a terrorist group in a terrorist coalition with Islamic Jihad in the terrorists coalition with the with Hamas the idea that we pay the money taxpayer money my money is totally insane by the way he did not take Jerusalem off the table for for Israel right he just said we're not gonna pressure Israel on Jerusalem which is not quite the same thing the US has budgeted 251 million dollars in aid for the West Bank the Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip in 2018 that means money for Hamas we should cut off that aid immediately now we should have done it years ago and good for Trump for doing it hopefully he will actually follow up on that okay other things that I like so there's a book that I read over the weekend and it's it's kind of interesting it's it's a book by a guy named Albert J nock this was written and I think 1934 the book is called our enemy the state now there are a lot of people who are sort of anarcho-capitalists or big fans of this book because the basic premise of the book is that there's a difference between government and the state the state is this this instrument of power that is used in order to harness wealth for a particular few I obviously agree with that general premise where I think he goes off the rails he's a very Charles beardian analysis of the American Founding he basically suggests that the American founders were seeking to enrich themselves and that's why they founded the country in the way that they did as a republic he prefers the Articles of Confederation system because he thinks that a non centralized American government was a better solution I disagree with him on some of this analysis but I think that he makes a good case for the idea that the sort of German progressive style state has taken over America's perception Americans perception of what the state should do and we need to rethink that the government should basically be returned to as far of a local system as possible it's really interesting when I was growing up I was a big fan of John Adams I still am a fan of John Adams as I get older I tend to be more friendly to Jeffersonian philosophy with regard to devolution of authority to local government John Adams obviously was in favor of more centralization of function in the federal government John Jefferson was precisely the reverse but Jefferson also was happy to use the federal government to do the Louisiana Purchase an unconstitutional move that he felt would enrich the country so knock is not completely incorrect when he says that it's pretty easy for people who view themselves as small government advocates to becoming advocates a big government when it's useful for them become part of the state apparatus now the book is called our enemy of the state and it is worth a read again it's more of an anarchist book than than it is an anarchist book than it is a conservative book per se but it was apparently informative and for from William F Buckley among others okay time for a couple of things that I hate okay so we'll do one quick thing that I hate it was a couple of quick things that I hit I suppose so okay so there's a New York Times op-ed today from a woman named Kishan Akali all about how Erica garner her death on Saturday is the fault of the American system or somesuch so Erika Garner you'll recall is the daughter of Eric garner Eric garner is the guy who died after he was put in a in a suppression hold by the New York City Police Department for selling loosies which were cigarettes that were not licensed because the cigarette taxes are so high there are people undercutting them on the black market and he died he had a heart attack so here is what this woman cash anna kelly writes in the new york times she says other families could devote themselves to spending time together around tables piled with celebrity food but the garner has had to keep vigil around a hospital bed because Erika suffered a heart attack on Christmas Eve and spent most of the last week in a coma she died on fairly young at 27 that's three years after he died her dad died on fairly young at 43 when officer Daniel Pantaleo of the Newark Police Department placed him in a banned chokehold so you'll number one have to ask why a woman would have a heart attack at 27 right and that's not that's not fall to the cops right well if you have a heart attack at 27 and that's because you either have a congenital heart situation or because you have a severe weight problem which could also be congenital that leads to heart disease right Erika Garner had two kids if both she and her dad had been alive this holiday season they would have almost certainly spent it together he was a family man she said about it's all very sad obviously but here's where she starts to go off the rails this columnist she says since the country's founding black families have never been able to thrive slavery broke them apart by allowing family members to be sold at auctions to different owners obviously true millions of black family members were killed during slavery and the lynching era from 1877 to 1950 I don't know about millions I'd have to actually look up the statistics about I don't think that certainly millions of people are not lynched during that period that's that's a that's a wild exaggeration in terms of lynching itself in terms of black family members who died I mean I assume the desk millions black defendants often received far longer sentences than similarly situated white defendants so the idea here is that black families are being destroyed by the constant ongoing oppression this was true during slavery not as for during Jim Crow because even under Jim Crow families could live together I mean once you are free to marry then it is your responsibility to stay with your kids right the fact is that the the black single motherhood rate in 1960 was 20% today it's 70% how is that the fault of American government per se other than a welfare system that incentivizes men not to stick around and incentivizes women not to get married before having babies it's it's difficult for me to imagine how you can blame slavery for a in elevation a three hundred and fifty percent elevation in the black single motherhood rate since the advent of the civil rights movement essentially that's it's a very weird contention but the idea here is that it's all the fault of the system that black families are disproportionately affected by child protection systems I haven't seen the evidence for that she says she concludes by suggesting if there is no sin in killing Eric garner no crime then black families like the Garner's can be destroyed without anyone having to answer for it now we can go over the garner case again but the idea that most black families are being destroyed by the system is just not true most black families are not in place in the first place in the sense of a mother and father who are married having kids most black families are not made like that it's not like they're married couples there broken up by the state as it was the case during slavery that's not what's happening here and to pretend otherwise is just to be non factual speaking of non-factual there are a lot of people who are talking this week about the new statistics out from New York City where murders are down again and the crime levels are really low and they're suggesting that this is because of the end of stop and frisk that stop and frisk it turns out didn't do anything I find the evidence on this strangely weird you can't use New York City as the only evidence of proactive policing proactive policing has stopped in places like Ferguson and Baltimore the crime rate has risen dramatically proactive policing has stopped in Los Angeles in Detroit the crime rate has risen dramatically in New York City one of the reasons the crime rate has not written dramatically the risen dramatically is because stop and frisk was so it was so thorough and because the policing was so proactive for literally decades I mean New York City coined this stuff then now you're seeing the kind of trailing effect Heather McDonald is a very good piece you should go over and check it out in City Journal all about what's happened demographically in the city of New York and what she basically says is that the areas that were responsible for super high crime in New York have largely become Denver gentrified as a result of good policing and so you're now seeing the evolutionary overhang of good crime policies and if you continue to have bad crime policies eventually then you will see a breakdown again but you won't see it in most gentrified areas you'll see in areas that are not as gentrified ok a quick final thing we'll deconstruct the culture very briefly so Justin Timberlake has a new video out as you know I love Justin Timberlake I don't I don't know anything about Justin Timberlake except that he grabs Janet Jackson's boob occasionally in any case John Justin Timberlake has cut a new video the part that I find noteworthy about this is that the left is going crazy about this music video and I really don't see why so here it is it's produced by Pharrell and his wife Jessica Biel is is they're in a voiceover so here is the the trailer for his album man of the woods this album is really inspired by my son my wife my family but more so than any other album I've ever written where I'm from and it's personal Justin Timberlake loves nature man it's it's fire okay so in any case the reason that this is noteworthy is because first of all Justin Timberlake is from Tennessee right he is from Tennessee so people have freedom like you - oh look look at this look at the city boy going and acting like he likes all the nature and such okay he is from Memphis Tennessee he grew up in Shelby Forest which is a small community between Memphis and Millington I know this because of dr. Wikipedia right is this idea that he has no connection with sort of the country is just silly but there are bunch of people who are pissed about it so there's it there's an article in a an outlet called the outline where they say Justin Timberlake is rebranding as a white man he's embracing his authentic roots rebranding is white what was he ever black tan I missed that part because I'm pretty aware that everybody knew that he was white for like his entire life because he's white but he's a rebranding as a white man to go back to where you're from I mean he's from Memphis I just I don't understand this but again the race-baiting is so thorough here that if you are if you're a guy who wears a cowboy hat you want to talk about kind of cultural cultural discrimination if you are a white guy who wears a cowboy hat or boots in a place with a bush then all of a sudden you are considered a hick who hates black people I mean that's basically what the outline is trying to say here there's literally what they say I have to read this cuz it's insane they say the trailer for Timberlake's new album man of the woods present the former NSYNC heartthrob looking pensive in various natural settings hitting every note of the white man finding himself in the empty West trope that has long been part of America's romantic fictional past well what now like huh this is white colonialist fantasies aside there's something very familiar about this pivot and Timberlake style white colonialist fantasy he's literally standing on a rock I don't see his slaves I don't see him fighting with Native Americans right what Pocahontas is nowhere to be found but the insane race consciousness here is just beyond so that what they're saying is that Timberlake has a long history with hip-hop and R&B genre is invented and dominated by black people and to be clear without african-americans there would be no rock or country music as we know it either but I digress right say he moved from quote/unquote black culture but now he's pandering to white America um or maybe he just wants to do an album about where he's from is that possible okay what if I just like jazz I like jazz not because it was invented by black people but because classic jazz is great stuff and what if I like country music because I'm Jewish like I have no connection I have no real connection to any of these musics probably more to jazz and I need a country music but this this is this notion that everything has to be broken down by sort of cultural stereotype it just demonstrates the intersectional stupidity of so many people who are commentators in our culture I don't see what Justin Timberlake is doing wrong by standing in a jacket in a forest like the forests belong to us all okay enough enough okay so we will be back we will be back here at tomorrow with much much more because there's always news breaking and I assume president Trump will have access to his Twitter so we'll have a lot to talk about I'm Ben Shapiro this venture Pierrot show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex's and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Jael para the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright Ford publishing
