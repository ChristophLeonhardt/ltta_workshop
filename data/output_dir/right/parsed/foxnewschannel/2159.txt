MILITARY SECRETS.
THE REGIME ARRESTED HIM IN 2015,
SENTENCED HIM TO A DECADE OF
HARD LABOR.
LET'S TURN TO BILL RICHARDSON,
NEGOTIATED THE RELEASE OF AN
AMERICAN PRISONER IN NORTH KOREA
IN 1996.
NOT EASY, IS IT, SIR?
>> NO, IT'S NOT EASY.
THIS IS TYPICAL OF THE NORTH
KOREANS.
THEY DRUM UP A LOT OF INTEREST.
I SUSPECT THEY WILL RELEASE THE
THREE BUT THEN THEY USE THEM AS
BARGAINING CHIPS.
IN THE PAST, YOU SEND A BIG
FORMER PRESIDENT, CARTER OR
CLINTON, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE
PRISONERS.
IN THIS CASE, WHAT THEY GET IN
RETURN IS A SUMMIT WITH THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS
WANTED.
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT SAYS
THE ONE REASON FOR THAT SUMMIT
IS TO DO AWAY WITH THEIR NUCLEAR
PROGRAM, TO END THEIR
NUCLEARIZATION.
ARE THERE SIGNS THAT NORTH KOREA
WILL BE WILLING TO DO THAT?
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AN
INTERESTING SUMMIT.
WE HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION
FROM THE NORTH KOREANS ON WHAT
DENUCLEARIZATION IS.
FOR THE PRESIDENT, FOR US,
IT'S -- THEY'RE GOING TO
DISMANTLE THEIR WEAPONS.
FOR THE NORTH KOREANS, IT'S A
FREEZE.
WE'RE GOING TO STOP DEVELOPMENT
OF MISSILES, NUCLEAR.
SO THAT HAS TO BE NARROWED DOWN
IN THE SUMMIT.
I THINK THE RELEASE OF THIS
PRISONER, YOU SET A GOOD TONE
RELEASING THEM ON HUMANITARIAN
REASONS.
THE NORTH KOREANS, THAT I WERE
TRUMPED UP CHARGES.
YOU MENTIONED THEM.
THEY WERE AMERICANS TEACHING
THERE, DOING BUSINESS, HOSTILE
ACTS.
YOU KNOW, THE NORTH KOREANS
ALWAYS DO THAT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS TO DO IS SAY TO
NORTH KOREA, STOP DETAINING
AMERICANS.
STOP DETAINING PEOPLE THAT COME
IN AND LEAVE THEM ALONE AND STOP
USING THEM AS BARGAINING CHIPS.
THAT'S ANOTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
THAT MIGHT MAKE THE SUMMIT A
SUCCESS.
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT HAS
TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY HOLDING
THIS SUMMIT AROUND THE PEACE
HOUSE AROUND THE DENUCLEARIZED
ZONE THERE BETWEEN NORTH AND
SOUTH KOREA.
HE SAID IT WOULD BE GREAT TO
HAVE A CELEBRATION OF THINGS
THERE.
IN REALITY, WOULDN'T THERE BE A
LOT OF NEGOTIATING AFTER THE
SUMMIT?
>> YES.
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS, SHEP,
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS, YOU
NEGOTIATE NOT ACROSS THE TABLE.
THAT'S NOT WHEN THEY MAKE
CONCESSIONS.
THEY DO IT IN INFORMAL
GATHERINGS.
EITHER DINING OR WALKING
TOGETHER AND MAKING DEALS.
I THINK WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT
IS THAT THE TWO PRESIDENTS
DEVELOP SOME KIND OF A PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP.
I WORRY THAT AT THE PEACE HOUSE,
I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES, THE
FACILITY IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO
MEETING OUTSIDE OF JUST THE
FORMAL TABLE.
SO YOU KNOW, I SAW THAT
SINGAPORE IS A POSSIBILITY.
KIM JONG-UN DOESN'T LIKE TO
TRAVEL BY AIRPLANE.
HE LIKES TO TRAVEL BY RAIL.
SO MAYBE A RUSSIAN ISLAND.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING
TO DECIDE.
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE SECTION
OF THE SUMMIT FOR INFORMAL
SETTINGS.
THAT'S WHEN YOU NEGOTIATE DEALS
