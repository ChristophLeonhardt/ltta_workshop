00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:04,823
>> Bill: REACTION FROM THE

2
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:06,258
WHITE HOUSE.

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:06,892
READ THE SARAH SANDERS'

4
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:09,761
STATEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

5
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:12,097
WE CONDEMN THE ATTEMPTED

6
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:14,466
VIOLENT ATTACKS MADE AGAINST

7
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:15,867
PRESIDENT OBAMA, SECRETARY

8
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,269
CLINTON AND OTHER PUBLIC

9
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:17,736
FIGURES.

10
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:19,137
ANYONE RESPONSIBLE WILL BE HELD

11
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:19,805
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE FULLEST

12
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:20,772
EXTENT OF THE LAW.

13
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:22,207
THE UNITED STATES SECRET

14
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,109
SERVICE AND OTHER LAW

15
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,344
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE

16
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:27,145
INVESTIGATING AND WILL TAKE ALL

17
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:28,447
APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO PROTECT

18
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:30,182
ANYONE THREATENED BY THESE

19
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:33,518
COWARDS.

20
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:36,321
WANT TO BRING IN MICHAEL,

21
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:37,789
FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY MEMBER.

22
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,526
WHAT IS YOUR IMPRESSION WHAT

23
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:42,661
YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE POST

24
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:44,162
OFFICE FINDING THIS FIRST.

25
00:00:44,163 --> 00:00:46,465
>> THE CONCERN ABOUT THE POST

26
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:47,866
OFFICE IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

27
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:49,301
DON'T KNOW THIS BUT THE POST

28
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:52,804
OFFICE DOES NOT SCREEN FOR

29
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:53,205
EXPLOSIVES.

30
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:54,439
THEY HAVE BIOLOGICAL WEAPON

31
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,841
SCREENING CAPABILITIES BUT THEY

32
00:00:55,842 --> 00:00:57,009
REALLY DON'T SCREEN FOR

33
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,409
EXPLOSIVES.

34
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,578
YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP FROM

35
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,746
OTHER SOURCES TO PREVENT IT

36
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:03,548
LIKE THE SECRET SERVICE OR

37
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:06,585
ROUTINE SCREENING THAT AN

38
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:07,753
INDIVIDUAL MIGHT DO.

39
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:09,688
THE SECOND ASPECT, THOUGH, IS

40
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,356
THAT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE

41
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:12,524
STAMPS ON THE PACKAGE, YOU

42
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:14,626
MIGHT HAVE A ROADMAP TO WHERE

43
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:16,028
THE INDIVIDUAL TRIED TO MAIL

44
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:16,495
THESE THINGS.

45
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:17,996
THE INFORMATION I'M RECEIVING

46
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:20,565
ABOUT THE DEVICE IS THAT THEY

47
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,134
WERE CRUDE BUT REAL.

48
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:24,102
THIS WAS NOT A PHONY -- THESE

49
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:26,104
WERE NOT PHONY DEVICES.

50
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:27,039
THEY DIDN'T DETONATE.

51
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,608
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS ABOUT

52
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:30,042
FUNCTIONALITY.

53
00:01:30,043 --> 00:01:31,910
ALSO HEARD SOME DESCRIPTIONS

54
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:32,611
ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITY NOT

55
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:34,579
QUITE BEING WHAT YOU NEED IT TO

56
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,814
DO TO DETONATE THESE THINGS.

57
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:37,416
BUT EACH TIME THAT YOU HAVE

58
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,651
THESE TYPES OF DEVICES IT IS A

59
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:40,018
SIGNATURE.

60
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,220
THE WAY THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER,

61
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:43,488
THE MATERIALS THEY WERE

62
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,023
CONSTRUCTED OUT OF, THE TIMING.

63
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:47,392
ALL THESE THINGS ARE VERY

64
00:01:47,393 --> 00:01:48,226
IMPORTANT AND TO LEAD

65
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:49,127
INVESTIGATORS BACK TO WHO MIGHT

66
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:50,662
HAVE SENT THESE THINGS.

67
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:52,097
>> Sandra: THAT'S IMPORTANT

68
00:01:52,098 --> 00:01:53,498
CONSIDERING WE'RE LEARNING

69
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:54,666
ABOUT THESE DEVICES JUST ONE

70
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:58,170
DAY AFTER THE BOMB WAS FOUND IN

71
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:58,770
GEORGE SOROS'S MAILBOX.

72
00:01:58,771 --> 00:01:59,838
YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT THEY'LL

73
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:02,641
BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THESE

74
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:03,308
DEVICES AND POTENTIALLY TIE

75
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:05,444
TOGETHER, IF THERE IS A TIE, TO

76
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:07,179
WHO DID THESE AND WHO MADE

77
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,181
THESE AND POTENTIALLY PUT THEM

78
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:09,647
IN PLACE.

79
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,217
THAT BEING SAID, IT'S TOUGH TO

80
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:14,086
TRY TO DECIPHER BETWEEN THE

81
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:15,020
DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES THAT ARE

82
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:15,954
RELEASING INFORMATION ON THIS

83
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:17,823
WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS POINT.

84
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:19,491
THE SECRET SERVICE IN THEIR

85
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:22,761
STATEMENT CALLED THESE

86
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:23,929
POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

87
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,597
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES CERTAINLY.

88
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,466
ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS VIA

89
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,268
THE A.P. THEY'RE CALLING THESE

90
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,937
FUNCTIONAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

91
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:33,105
WERE THEY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES IS

92
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:34,740
WHAT YOU'RE CONFIRMING?

93
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:36,808
>> THEY WERE, IN FACT

94
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:37,309
FUNCTIONAL.

95
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,944
THEY DIDN'T WORK OR DETONATE

96
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:40,112
BECAUSE OF A PARTICULAR FLAW

97
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:42,948
THAT WAS IN THE DESIGN OF IT

98
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,282
WHEN THEY PUT IT TOGETHER.

99
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:45,217
THAT INFORMATION WILL CONTINUE

100
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:47,786
COMING AND WILL BE THE FOCUS OF

101
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:48,220
INVESTIGATORS.

102
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,689
BUT THIS TAKES US BACK AND

103
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,259
REMINDS US OF THE TED KOEZ

104
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,828
INSKI ATTACK THAT LASTED FROM

105
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,763
1978 TO 1995.

106
00:02:57,764 --> 00:03:00,398
HE HAD MAILED -- USED THE MAIL

107
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,534
AS A DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR HIS

108
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:03,468
DEVICES BUT HE WAS ULTIMATELY

109
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,870
FOUND BUT AFTER A VERY LONG

110
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,104
PERIOD OF TIME.

111
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:06,872
WHICH INDICATES THAT THE

112
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:08,240
INVESTIGATION COULD GO ON A

113
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:08,540
WHILE.

114
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,142
THIS MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING

115
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:11,777
THAT WITHIN THE NEXT DAY OR SO

116
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:12,277
WE'LL SEE.

117
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:15,413
THE OTHER THING THAT YOU SHOULD

118
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:19,484
PAY ATTENTION TO IS THAT THE

119
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,153
SOURCES TALKING TO ME SAY THIS

120
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:23,021
COULD BE SOMETHING MORE

121
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:23,421
WIDESPREAD.

122
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:24,689
THESE THREE PACKAGES MIGHT NOT

123
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,357
BE ALL.

124
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:27,926
>> Sandra: I WANT TO GET

125
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:28,927
BREAKING NEWS IN.

126
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:31,463
THE CNN BUREAU IN NEW YORK CITY

127
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:32,063
HAVE BEEN EVACUATED.

128
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:33,665
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW ON THAT.

129
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,200
THE TIME WARNER CENTER WE WERE

130
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,570
ALSO TOLD HAS BEEN EVACUATED IN

131
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:39,204
RECENT MOMENTS.

132
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:40,138
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING

133
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:41,373
RIGHT NOW AS WE CONTINUE TO

134
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:46,278
LEARN MORE,  MICHAEL.

135
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,413
>> THE BOMB SQUAD WAS ON ITS

136
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:49,347
WAY TO TIME WARNER CENTER WHEN

137
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:51,716
I WAS ON MY WAY HERE.

138
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:54,519
I SAW THE VEHICLES GOING BY

139
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,921
WITH SIRENS.

140
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:58,256
IF IT'S MEDIA OUTLETS AND

141
00:03:58,257 --> 00:03:59,424
INDIVIDUALS HIGH PROFILE THIS

142
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:02,727
IS A CONCERTED EFFORT TO DO A

143
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:03,461
WIDE-BASED DISTRIBUTION OF

144
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:03,895
THESE DEVICES.

145
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:05,764
>> Bill: HOW WOULD YOU KNOW

146
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:07,432
BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE, HOW

147
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,633
WOULD SOMEBODY WORKING IN A

148
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:09,534
POST OFFICE FIND THIS?

149
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:11,870
>> IT WOULD BE BY THE BOX

150
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:12,204
ITSELF.

151
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:14,206
IN OTHER WORDS, LOOKED LIKE A

152
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:14,739
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE.

153
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,075
AS I SAID BEFORE, THE POST

154
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:19,311
OFFICE DOES NOT SCREEN FOR

155
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:19,678
EXPLOSIVE.

156
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:20,644
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY DO.

157
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:21,580
BUT THEY DON'T.

158
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,248
IF YOU HAD A BOX -- WHAT

159
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:25,584
HAPPENS IF THERE IS A WIRE

160
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:27,219
STICKING OUT OR DEPENDING WHAT

161
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,154
TYPE OF DEVICE, WHAT TYPE OF

162
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:31,056
MATERIAL IS USED, THERE COULD

163
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:33,525
BE SOME TYPE OF OIL THAT SEEPS

164
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:34,960
THROUGH THE PACKAGE.

165
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:36,127
THESE ARE TYPICAL INDICATORS

166
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:38,230
THAT THE DEVICE MIGHT -- THAT A

167
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:39,097
PACKAGE MIGHT CONTAIN A DEVICE

168
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:40,765
AND IT IS WHEN YOU DO MAIL

169
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,000
SCREENING THESE ARE SOME OF THE

170
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,870
SIGNS THAT YOU LOOK FOR WHEN

171
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,504
YOU TAKE -- IN THE PACKAGE.

172
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:48,740
>> Sandra: WHAT DOES THE

173
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:49,541
INVESTIGATION LOOK LIKE, WOULD

174
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,877
YOU BE ABLE TO GIVE US AN IDEA

175
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:53,278
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THIS MOMENT

176
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,380
AS WE LEARN AND TO REPORT AGAIN

HILLARY CLINTON.

186
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:13,899
NEITHER OF THESE DEVICES WERE

187
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,468
RECEIVED BY THE OBAMAS OR THE

00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:26,544
AND LOCAL RESOURCES TO

194
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:27,846
DETERMINE WHAT THEY CAN.

195
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:28,780
WHAT DOES THE INVESTIGATION

196
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:29,948

00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:37,856
THAT PACKAGE IS RENDERED SAFE

201
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,190
AND THEN THAT'S WHY YOU'LL HAVE

202
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:41,059
THE BOMB TEAMS THAT WILL GO TO

203
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,397
A LARGE FACILITY LIKE THE TIME

204
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:46,231
WARNER CENTER.

205
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:47,632
THERE IS GREAT SECURITY, SAME

206
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:50,802
WITH THE OTHER FACILITY.

207
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,437
BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THE

208
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:53,838

WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION.

213
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:02,047
SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH

214
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:02,981
PACKAGES WERE DELIVERED BY

215
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:10,121

216
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:10,588
PLACED.

217
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,090
TED PLACED SOME DEVICES

218
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:12,557
PERSONALLY.

219
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:14,192
WHAT THE INVESTIGATION WILL DO

220
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:17,062
FIRST, GO TALK TO THE MAILMAN

221
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:20,098

HOW DID IT GET TO THE FACILITY?

224
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,537
WHAT TRUCK WAS IT IN?

225
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,073
WHAT TYPE OF STAMPS WERE ON IT?

226
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:30,175
AND TRACE IT BACK TO WHERE IT

227
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:36,581
MIGHT HAVE COME AND WHO MIGHT

228
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:38,650
HAVE DEDEPOSITED THE POST

229
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:39,117
OFFICE BOX.

POSSIBLY PUT IT INTO THE
