00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,840
to my mother who will forever live on in

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:19,980
my heart<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am my mother's incomplete</font>

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,720
poet I am the unspoken stories too young

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,150
to hear not yet ripe enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have my</font>

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,810
eyes peeled to a past long left behind I

6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,570
am that old set reminiscence stored in

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,120
the dusty bookshelf corner of your mind

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,000
I and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> old song mama mama you know I</font>

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,420
discordant flow tides kissing and

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,030
hitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sand bit of your life giving</font>

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,549
organ these melodies kept my blood

14
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,610
pumping but what are the pulses now if

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,390
the oceans turned blue I I remember the

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,479
waves of<font color="#E5E5E5"> once restless nights your</font>

17
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,580
pillars were soaked in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tears of</font>

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,610
uncertain futures of what now when how

19
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,250
will she be without me you never uttered

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,049
them to me but I could hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it through</font>

21
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,720
thin paper walls they would bang against

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,350
my door but I never opened<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now future</font>

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,280
has come but the pillows still haven't

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,610
dried can you dry them for me mama wipe

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,890
my tears just once more what I wouldn't

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,710
do to have you wipe my tears just once

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,450
more now I hold my breath that oceans

28
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,030
will let rainfall from these round

29
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,430
condensing clouds to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shore that is</font>

30
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,829
my mouth and let me swallow these salty

31
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,450
speeds let it leave when did<font color="#E5E5E5"> knots in my</font>

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,299
stomach and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that I am strong for</font>

them mama for wind and fire is my breath

34
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,340
now I'm sanctuary for these icy hollow

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,350
hearts I'm still learning

36
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,540
to turn the other cheek mama to find joy

37
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,880
in the grief because grief is but a gift

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,610
disguise this pain wrapped in this

39
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,190
present moment as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> longing for a past</font>

40

<font color="#E5E5E5">hands imprinted being of her immortal</font>

42
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,400
tenderness I can still feel the smooth

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,710
grooves of words you left on my heart

44
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,590
