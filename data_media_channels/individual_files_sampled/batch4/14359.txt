the Liberals just want to talk about feminism because they prefer to talk about it rather than the hard stuff like math yeah you know this is a really bizarre budget in that respect I don't Lee anyone object to the idea of governments eliminating barriers the women face but I did a quick word search in this budget as revealed or gender or here's three hundred and fifty nine times in this budget and the word deficit appears twelve times so in terms of a fiscal document it's a little bit weirder and I spent you know there's dozens and dozens of pages talking about the gender balance gender-based analysis that they're doing but very little about simple things like the deficit and debt and how they're who address as you said off the top the competitive tax pressure so it's just it was almost as if they didn't want to write a budget they wanted to talk about sociology and Gender Studies and that's really well made out most of the document that's I think I did the same thing too I typed in the word gender I typed in word climate and carbon and those words are all throughout there but the word farm there's only a handful of times and it's mainly the prison farm they're restarting again it's so weird it reminds me of Trudeau's great speech in Davos Switzerland at the World Economic Forum just a few weeks ago this was his great investment pitch to the world's big shots the CEOs of global companies and he basically did the feminist speech and and one of the things he promised there that there would be gender quotas or at least they would ask companies require companies to report their gender strategies now as a condition of being a company in Canada that's in the budget let me throw this at Jim Aaron I never understood why Trudeau won't shut up about feminism and Andrew claim in one of our you know society critics he said well it's because when you talk about feminism you don't have to talk about the tough stuff you can drag your opponents into some debate where they always look like the meanie the bad guy and you don't have to come up with a good answer for taxes deficits you don't have to have an understanding of NAFTA or treaties that his theory I just thought there would be some grown-up who would write a real budget while Trudeau was saying all the feminist blather I guess not yeah you know the strangest thing about it too is even the folks who are plotting this type of language they're still not happy because frankly there's no money attached to it they just talked about a bunch of stuff and I'm grateful they didn't spend a whole bunch of money they don't have on any of these initiatives but they haven't really pleased anyone they've annoyed people who are concerned about fiscal issues like us because they haven't dealt with them and then they've used a whole bunch of flowery language about feminism but they haven't back it up with dollar so they haven't kept people happy on the other side eater that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
