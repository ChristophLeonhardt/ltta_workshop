HEATHER: DONALD TRUMP SIGNING THE RIGHT TO TRY BILL INTO LAW WHICH OFFERS TERMINAL PATIENTS THE CHOICE TO TRY EXPERIENTIAL TREATMENT EVEN WITHOUT FDA APPROVAL. IS THIS A GOOD IDEA OR A BAD THING FOR PATIENTS. DR. NICOLE SAFIRE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET'S SHOW PEOPLE WHAT THIS RIGHT TO TRY LAW WOULD SAY, TO AUTHORIZE USE, DIAGNOSED WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS IT DOES IT HAVE TO BE A TERMINAL ILLNESS? THE FDA IS AMERICA'S WATCHDOG, KEEPS FAKE PRODUCTS OFF THE MARKET AND UNSAFE PRODUCTS. THE RIGHT TO TRY LAW IS ESSENTIALLY MAKING SURE THOSE WITH TERMINAL ILLNESSES WHO HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS HAVE ACCESS TO DRUG COMPANIES TO HAVE MEDICATIONS OR TREATMENTS THAT MAY WORK BUT HAVEN'T PROVEN SAFE THROUGH THE FDA. WE HAVE A PROCESS LIKE THAT IN PLACE BY THE FDA AND THEY APPROVE 99% OF REQUESTS IN THESE INSTANCES BUT THIS IS JUST REALLY A GREAT WAY FOR THE UNITED STATES TO SHOW WE ARE THERE TO GIVE AMERICANS EVERY OPTION POSSIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO TERMINAL ILLNESSES. HEATHER: DOES THE DRUG HAVE TO BE IN THE PROCESS OF APPROVAL? THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE PHASE 1. AFTER PHASE I A LOT OF DRUGS DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH FDA APPROVAL. THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE GETTING THESE MEDICATIONS, AS A PHYSICIAN WE DON'T KNOW THE SIDE EFFECTS TO LOOK FOR THEIR SAFETY PROFILE. IT IS A LITTLE CONCERNING BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE FDA IS AWARE OF THE MEDICATIONS. HOWEVER, IN AN EMOTIONAL SENSE IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE, YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM EVERY CHANCE. THERE IS ALWAYS THAT HOPE ISSUED TO GIVE THE PATIENT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NEXT ISSUE, A WARNING TO AVOID HOMEOPATHIC TEETHING PRODUCTS. GO TO ANY BABY I'LL YOU WILL SEE MEDICATIONS EQUIVALENT TO THE ADULT ONES, ORAJEL THAT YOU CAN RUB ON BABIES GUMS, THE FDA HAS FOR YEARS PUT WARNINGS OUT SAYING YOU DON'T TAKE THEM BUT THEY ARE GETTING MORE SERIOUS AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO GET THEM OFF THE CELLS BECAUSE THERE IS A COMPONENT IN THESE MEDICINES THAT CAN DISPLACE OXYGEN FROM THE CHILD'S BLOOD, FROM THE HEMOGLOBIN. THIS CAN HAPPEN IN ADULTS, BEING A CHILD EFFECTS ARE MORE SEVERE WITH A SMALLER AMOUNT OF MEDICATION. WHEN IT COMES TO TEETHING DON'T USE THE NUMBING MEDICATION, GUM MASSAGE BILL: WILL OUTGROW IT. I HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT IT BUT LEAVE IT TO TWITTER. I STARTED SEEING SUNSCREEN PILLS THEY ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO TAKE AND IT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM THE SUN'S RAYS BUT IT IS NOT TRUE. Reporter: YOU CANNOT REPLACE SUNSCREEN WITH A PILL. THEY ARE PACKED WITH ANTIOXIDANTS WHICH ARE GREAT FOR YOUR SKIN AND HAVE PROVEN SUN DAMAGE EFFECTS AND PROTECT YOU IN THE LONG TERM FROM SUN DAMAGE BUT THEY ARE NOT PROTECTING YOU FROM ACUTE SUN DAMAGE, GETTING BURNED. PEOPLE ARE TAKING THIS MEDICATION AT NOT APPLYING SUNSCREEN AND THAT IS A NO-NO. HEATHER: IF YOU TAKE MEDICATION MAKE SURE YOU PUT SUNSCREEN ON AS WELL. LONGSLEEVED, PANTS, HATS. HEATHER: REMEMBER THE PILLS THEY USED TO HAVE THAT ALLEGEDLY GAVE
