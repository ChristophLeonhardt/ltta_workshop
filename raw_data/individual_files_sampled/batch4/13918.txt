that sort of thing so instead today in the spirit of International Women's Day I will name just a few of my favorite international women Jewish Jewish women I really like obviously for obvious reasons English women are great because they have that cute little accent and also don't don't let anybody tell you that English cooking is no good a nice a nice slice of beef wellington with that flaky little dough mm-hmm there are a few things better and then of course the third Brazilian Brazilian women because they're tall and tan and young and lovely The Girl From Ipanema goes walking and when she passes each one she passes goes ah there you have it my favorite international women that's a really wonderful way to start the day happy International Women's Day everybody this is the top hashtag on Twitter I'm sure you've seen it of course nobody knows anything about the day you see these things on Twitter you say oh yeah it's international what in one day okay great yeah okay well what is the history of this as with most things that begin with the word International International Women's Day is socialist and nonsense and it's particularly nefarious socialist nonsense but we'll get to why later it changed the 20th century in some ways so it's really bad the first National Women's Day was held in 1909 in New York guess who organized the socialist Party of America not surprising in 1910 the international socialist Women's Conference created International Women's Day finally at the one year after after New York's following the October Revolution in 1917 Vladimir Lenin made it a national holiday in the Soviet Union he made International Women's Day a national holiday wonder why communist thugs made International Women's Day a national holiday it's because on International Women's Day on March 8th in 1917 a International Women's demonstration actually started the Russian Revolution it started the Communist revolution that just destroyed the 20th century is a true story a protest of women textile workers in Petrograd took place this is commonly cited as the inciting incident of the Russian Revolution Trotsky admitted Leon Trotsky admitted that he'd helped plan the protest but even he was surprised and how widespread its effects were he wrote quote meetings and actions were foreseen but we did not imagine that this Women's Day would inaugurate the revolution but it did right from the horse's mouth right from that communist horse's mouth the holiday International Women's Day was celebrated almost exclusively by communist countries and socialist activists until 1975 when it was adopted by the United Nations but maybe that wasn't very much of a change was it maybe there's a lot of continuity there enough about International Women's Day on to a serious matter American women for Donald Trump American women for Trump day for that we spoke yesterday with Tana Gertz Tana is the former star of The Apprentice senior advisor to President trumps 2016 to 2020 campaigns let's bring her on Tana thank you for being here thanks for having me so you led the Trump campaign efforts in Iowa which President Trump won in 2016 and it was a big win because Barack Obama won that state in both 2008 and 2012 how did you and he'd do it Wow well hard work that's for sure we worked so so hard we left no stone unturned it weirdly really came down to we needed to educate the people of Iowa about about this man and in Iowa we don't have real stars because we don't have professional teams like a lot of states do so they're not used to having celebrities like Donald Trump come into town and take over and and so it was just it was a process of sort of teetering back and forth with you are this huge star but we're gonna just water it down for a little bit until they get to love you then we'll show them really what you're capable of and so I known him very for a couple of well almost a little over a decade so I knew how to strategize that relationship with him because I went from being unknown an unknown Iowan to being on his show then being a known Iowan and i know how i had to tread little lightly because they don't really you know they're not used to that right and that that's so interesting your experience of him probably made it so much easier for the campaign to work I see in campaigns all the time they bring in the professional crew from DC the whole consultant class and usually it's usually those guys are full of it I mean they don't know anything about the district right no they don't have a clue actually that's what happened originally where you know let's come on in and the bravado of Trump and and all this and all that and bring in the bells and the whistles but at the end of the day no we need to tread lightly then we'll amplify it so it was it was a process but but regardless of all of that that was just a small part of it what my role was cuz I I don't have a political bone in my body I don't have a gene my parents weren't you know political junkies so this was a decision that I had to make deciding do I want to walk into this arena that I'm not interested in never had an interest in but I want to make history with this man and I know I can sell them to the American people not only the people of Iowa so I had to say you know I'm gonna approach this like it's a business and that's exactly what I did so I more or less said to all those political what they thought were guru's removals because I'm coming in and there's a new sheriff in town and I know this man and you don't that's probably why you were successful I'm sure of it because I've seen it on the races that win are the ones where the the operatives and the workers know the candidate they know the district they're the idea of a political guru I think it's totally nonsense and you say you never worked on a political campaign in any capacity so what made you jump on Trump 2016 why Donald Trump well I was on his show and so the only reason is because I knew him I knew what he was capable of it'd be like your best friend somebody going do you think Michael could you know do you think Michael could make that caller or what and they're like oh my gosh like I know this man so well of course so you were at a believer you really thought he was the solution to America's problems let me tell you what the minute he came down that escalator I said it's over like I bet the farm and literally I won I won huge because I knew he was capable of it because I'd seen him in his boardroom I'd seen him with his employees I seen him with his family I know him stayed in touch with them I know how smart he is I know what an executor is he is I knew everything that I needed to know to say hey do I want to put my professional speaking career on hold and my business coaching career on hold oh and my little radio show on hold to go make history with the President of the United States duh of course I do right and that I knew if I could get him the win in Iowa well first off he told me I have to win Iowa or I will not be the next president and I knew if I got him the win here I'd have a trump card forever that you know that it is a huge accomplishment Iowa is the state you got to win Iowa and what I really like about your story is that you've known this guy for a long time because it seems to me there's this extremely tedious debate started by Trump's critics on the right really over whether Donald Trump is a complete nincompoop he's a total dolt as the never Trump crowd disingenuously mocks he he's playing for DHS those are the two options the the critics on the right they say he's either a dolt or he's playing 12 d dimensional chess I for one don't think it's either and I am a Trump supporter and I don't know any Trump supporter who thinks he's playing 12 D chess I just he's quite good at the media and I suspect that the guy who has remained relevant for 40 years and succeeded at the highest levels of four extremely competitive industries might be smarter than your average schlub you have known for a long time how would you describe the man personally he's actually the smartest man that I know and my husband follows right underneath that and my husband's a scientist graduated magna cum latte at Florida State he's a meteorologist brilliant so when I say he's Trump is the smartest man I know I'm that's not throwing that around lightly he is three steps ahead of everyone he he predicts what's coming like all these I was on TV I can't tell you how many times defending his quote conspiracy theory and I'm like Oh imagine that that came to fruition right I mean about the Obama administration using the government to attack his political opponent it was like Michael he went back to back to back like do you think that you know he was taped wire taped do you think this do you think everything that he said and they said they they killed me for on national television and I'm like no honestly it'll come to fruition it does so he's not only the smartest man that I know but he works so hard and the other thing that I love about him is he does his homework so if he was gonna be on an interview with you he would know everything about you he would know where you're from where you live if you're single if you if you I mean he'd know everything about you so he'd come into my state and he'd be like okay so Who am I gonna see here today and I'd be like oh you're gonna meet with um Governor Branstad and he'd be like oh oh yeah yeah he really likes China right okay and what else about him and he'd he's done his homework and the thing else that I love about him is I would also give him cliff notes literally on a back of a business card this do this do that watch the swear words this is that and literally and I go oh and here was another thing I was on his plane with him once and he told me that he spends it was I believe 1015 million dollars on John Deere equipment for his golf courses and I'm like oh my gosh okay stop right there this is AG real and you got to say that out there at that rally the place will go nuts and he's like okay and he trusts me because I'd never blow him up right and he gets out there and he goes you all like John Deere and the place you know I spend fifteen million dollars in John Deere equipment the police went crazy and guess what like overnight I started farmers for Trump we had we had so many men juiced up about the fact that he spends all that money on John Deere because he you know he trusted me I told him to say it he did his homework and and that's the thing I mean he's not only super smart he works super hard he puts in the time and he really wants to make a difference and the other thing that I love about him that maybe nobody has figured out yet is and I've learned this being a nobody and then becoming famous because of the show The Apprentice if the media doesn't make you the media can't break you right guess what the media never made Donald Trump so there's no way they're gonna take him down he made him himself all the Schmucks that were never known and you can even you know put me in that category media is never gonna break my witness I'll call you a schmuck town in no way people who were on the campaign that we're just taking a paycheck didn't even probably vote for the man and I also told him about all those losers you know took a paycheck didn't even care about him didn't even work their butt off for him probably didn't even vote for him just their the job just another job don't care you know chalk it in half way you know cash it in do the lazy man way out or whatever they're on CNN every night trying to get their keep their 15 minutes of fame well guess what the medial put them on let them implode themselves and now oh boy now they're spiraling out of control because why the media built them that's right you know this reminds me of an Andrew Clavin quote about Donald Trump which is he who Donald Trump would destroy he first makes mad you know and he doesn't even they do seem to all just blow up and spiral down and on the hard work you know this especially leading the efforts in Iowa if anybody's worked on any political campaign before I've worked on a lot at all different levels even if you're working on a dog catcher campaign it is exhausting grueling thankless work and to watch Donald Trump at the highest level and with unprecedented in modern history unprecedented opposition do it with a grin do it with that kind of trumpian smirk and seem to have inexhaustible stores of energy it really makes you question all of these news reports on CNN that he isn't in good health or he's alright rambling senile or whatever nonsense that they also said about Ronald Reagan right it's so true let me tell you what when we were towards the end and I knew I mean I knew he was gonna win this when it became the candidate and we went to the convention I was like oh my god like that the RNC convention was unbelievable his family was so amazing he was so amazing and then when I knew like oh my gosh this is this is in the bag we were wrapping up like Iowa and we had maybe three rallies in one day all across the state so we were flying in Trump force one and we were so hungry I mean I I know all's I had to do was get people there get volunteers there hype up the crowd and hand the mic over to the star and he wild everybody right so my she was on a ten his was on a twelve I only had to do you know maybe five minutes we're here to do an hour we get on the plane all's I wanted was that damn Big Mac that he was put in front of me and you know what I'm like you're so hungry oh you'll want to eat your Big Mac in your fries and you just want people to just shut up and let you eat so this man is taking grief about eating Big Macs he's working his butt off he is putting us like I mean he's got a couple decades on me I got three decades on some of these kids that are in the campaign that are just like the hell's going on and I'm like get out of the way cuz this man's blowin people down we are gonna take this all the way to the White House more energy than even me and I just looked at him like I know what it's like being a professional speaker when you get on that stage and you see your crowd man you just you light up and it's not work I absolutely right and I want to know how you think that's translating to 20/20 you're on the campaign in 2020 clearly you think he's doing a good job in office I also think he's doing a good job what do you think the people of Iowa will think as he lived up to his promises as he lived up to expectations are they gonna go for him in 2020 at this obviously I know it's early on but we'll yeah that's just right are they gonna go for him they are you know why their 401ks are growing he's promises made promises kept I keep saying that when we were when he just came out to Iowa recently the bottom of the stage big sign promises made promises kept and he's telling him this is what I've done I've told you farmers I wasn't gonna do this I told you I was gonna save the Renewable Fuels standard I told you this I told you that and it's all about like he's keeping his promises we love the fact that we we have more money in our 401ks and in our pocketbooks bank accounts also what about jobs you know like what about the jobs that he's bringing back to America he is like standing up for us and we needed somebody who had a set you know it could say like hey man guess what no more it's funny it's funny because those who are have been in the conservative movement a long time or worked on a lot of campaigns or just have their heads in politics we think oh man Trump has been great we've gotten all these originalist judges on the courts we've gotten deregulation at this agency and a pivot at this agency and do to do to do but for I think a lot of Americans what it cuts as a James Carville said it's the economy stupid and what it comes down to is this guy is a pro-growth president he's a guy who was gonna deregulate he's going to to do what works for the American economy and he's gonna prioritize not what kinds of bathrooms people have to use and this state or he's going to focus on what Americans care about which is how their wallets are doing how they what they get how much disposable income they have to spend on their families and to plan for their future and also Michael one other thing I'm gonna add is he also wants to keep America safe and that was a huge huge point for a lot of women and I started up the women for Trump coalition here in Iowa and women wanted to know like I don't need to worry that somebody's gonna come Isis is gonna come and steal my kids and hurt my family and so safety and that's another thing that you know he is he's not gonna back down and anybody that thinks that President Trump is going anywhere is sadly mistaken if anybody thinks the President Trump is going to weaken or kind of get worn out he's not he's Teflon Don is what I call him you know it just rolls right off of his back and and you know what it's he's kind of like I'm the same way if somebody wants to say yeah I don't know tan if you could do it oh really to me that's a dare right yeah and I will show you that I will and so it's going well people are really excited about him they'll vote for him again and and really we're only one year into this and people are already excited about the fact of what he's done give us three more years and he'll have so many people that are excited about him that I don't have any worries we'll do the exact same thing and what I'll do is sort of be scoreboard scoreboard oh yeah that was that would you remember that yeah we did that you know I will say I was so pleased and looking at the returns from the Texas GOP primaries from both primers Democrat and Republican they told us Republicans weren't going to turnout it was going to be a load turn big blue wave what happened record high GOP turnout now Democrats turned out to might at a much lower rate so we're still should be a little careful we got to make sure Republicans go out to vote but it was really excellent to see there's still a conservative exuberance and I have one last question before I have to let you go Tanna when are you gonna run for office you'd be very good at it you have everything it takes well I I appreciate that thank you very much I'm not politically correct and I don't ever want to be because I agree with President Trump you know there's a lot of a lot of wimpy people in offices that just don't like they don't they're not strong I like strength I have that same strength but I I don't ever see me doing this I'm loving what I'm doing and I'm really excited about my new business the us-china exchange group really excited to help push president Trump's agenda but from the outs and what does that what does the us-china exchange group what is it working on right now right now we're trying to get agribusinesses to sign up to go on a mission trip and we're taking ten companies US companies that want it grow and improve their trade relationships with China we're taking them over to China and we're gonna introduce them to their counterparts over there and help sort of be the project managers for making getting through the red tape in and making that a seamless process that's excellent well that's a worthwhile activity I'm glad you're doing it I totally understand why you wouldn't want to run for office I will say though I think one thing that Donald Trump has showed us is that politically incorrect is the new politically correct it clearly works politically quite well and we can probably thank President cough FA for that so hey listen maybe maybe there's a chance that if you run for office you don't have to become one of these mealy-mouthed boring politicians you can remain true to yourself and project strength I think it's worked out pretty well and Tanna thank you for being here well let you go how cool is she I love her tan inerts so I'm sorry guys I know if you are watching us on YouTube right now get yourself some clinical health because you're having delusions hallucinations or you're probably stumbling around drunk somewhere or on drugs it may be a few of you are still able to see us on YouTube even they're censoring the rest of it if you're on Facebook I'm sorry you have to go to daily wired.com right now what do you get if you go to daily wire it's ten bucks a month 100 dollars for an annual membership you get me you get the end of Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get to ask questions in the conversation that is going to be Tuesday March 13th at 5:30 p.m. Eastern 2:30 Pacific you look anybody can watch but only subscribers can ask the questions many are called but few are chosen if you want to do that you'll what you'll just tune right in it'll be streaming all over the place you go into the Daily wire to the conversation page you ask questions in the chat box Ben will answer them in the order that they come in but none of that matters nobody we don't really care about that do we really care about this leftist here's tumblr it's already filling because of the Texas primaries because the results came out and Republicans trounced Democrats and turnout by there were Democrats for 50% lower so look if you want to protect yourself and your family obviously there's a lot of talk about the constitutional right to keep and bear arms you need to defend yourself this is the only fda-approved vessel for salty delicious leftist tears so make sure you get it at daily wire comm we'll be right back we have a lot of mailbag today and I'm gonna bulldoze through them I don't care we're gonna I'm gonna make it happen from Michael Michael if a if the a main role of the government consists of preservation of life could it not be argued then that government has the duty to fully fund a universal health care I think by that you mean socialized medicine socialist socialist healthcare the government fully funds a police force in order to preserve life against the threat of criminals why not then against the threat of sickness or disease it seems to me that if we have a right to police protection then we should have a right to health care this is not putting a gun to police officers or doctors head enforcing their labor police officers sign up knowing that they have an obligation to protect people we why can't doctors sign up knowing they have an obligation to treat people I agree with limited government but if nothing else shouldn't it exist to provide things such as this no no I thank you for your question this is a common misunderstanding but no the purpose of the federal government is outlined for us by the framers it is quote to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity so I know what you're thinking you say well getting free health care that would be that would benefit my general welfare but definitely do benefit my welfare that's right but the trouble is health care never gets so expensive as when it's free so there have been many experiments in socialist health care throughout the world and it creates a lot of dissatisfaction we have the best health care system in the world in this country when all the rich people in the world want to get good health care they don't do it in their terrible country as they come to the United States for it because we have the best the end because we're innovators all of the other countries actually benefit from our innovation the trouble with socialized medicine too is that it dramatically decreases Liberty in this country we have a second Amendment to protect your life and liberty and pursuit of happiness from a tyrannical government that our government actually tells you you get to keep a gun so that you can shoot us if we start to it take away all if we start to take away your guns socialist healthcare puts your life in the hands of the government your your very health care your medicine your doctor visits your surgery is in the hands of the government that is a lot of power that not even a gun can protect against this is why in all of countries with socialist health care they there are long long waits to get surgery and people die on waiting lists I went down to Cuba last June and I got to talk to some people in Cuba and that one of them pointed out to me and said that's the big famous National Hospital Cuba touts its socialist health care system it says look everybody has access to this and they send their doctors abroad and everything there are a hundred percent of coverage in Cuba so ok so anybody can walk in and my pal and Cuba turned to me and II said yeah yeah anybody can walk in there won't be any medicine but anybody can walk in and you have to bring your own toilet paper and your own food and you sometimes your own needles and what really happens in that country and in a lot of socialist countries is that there are private backdoors so that people can actually get the medicine they need so there's if every person with any money who cares about their health in the UK also has private health insurance and in Cuba they just pay doctors on the side all serious health care in Cuba is taken care of on the black market and people pay for it because that's that's the way to get the best care at the lowest price it socialist medicine in a way that is unacceptable intolerable abridges our Liberty it also makes the cost of health care increase dramatically it also makes the quality of care decreased dramatically doesn't promote my general welfare I don't think next question from Andy hey Michael I'm a college sophomore in one of the classes I'm taking is basically a crash course on post-modernism it's probably all the classes you're taking for example last week our classes were about the myth of the meritocracy and white male privilege these people genuinely hate and look down on the idea of individualism and being able to improve the circumstances in your life through your own effort they really believe that we live in a society that only benefits rich white straight and Christian males I probably missed some how do I push back on these ideas it seems like a very dangerous ideology to buy into because they were obsessed with their own perceived power dynamics also are there any books or articles that you would recommend for me yeah absolutely it is a horrible ideology ideology in general isn't something that we should look toward or that we should embrace but this is a particularly rough one we are the only society we in the West that hates itself especially America we hate ourselves in our history and you know on history we are also the most frequently wrong and least often in doubt you don't see China hate itself you don't see Japan hate itself you don't see a lot of countries and a lot of places around the world hate themselves and and yet in the West we judge ourselves we are judged by our worst moments and whereas other societies we're told we have to judge them by their best moments so they always say in the way they said well you know there was the Spanish Inquisition in the West there were the Crusades in the West remind you they don't know anything about either of those two events both of which are entirely defensible but that should that'll be a separate episode but then they'll say oh but the the Muslim civilization they had Andalusia didn't they oh they had the the neoplatonist they had oh isn't that as they they presented a they only talk about these fine moments and they say oh well when Muslim terrorists blow up all of our cities in the West that you can't you can't mention that that has nothing to do with Islam that has nothing to do with their civilization how dare you and yet they're holding us accountable for a crusade that happened 800 years ago which is defensible it's totally insane the way to avoid this and to avoid this awful ideology is to read the originals the reason that your class seems like a crash course at post-modernism is this awful trend in liberal education we're no longer are we reading the the people that we're reading no longer are we reading the great books the Aristotle and Plato Cicero and Thucydides and all the way Aquinas and Dante and write all the way up we're reading books about those books and books about those people and it's what Harold Bloom calls the school of resentment it's books trying to take it apart trying to deconstruct all then tell you why it's so awful forget that forget that nonsense and that's stupid ideological lens read the originals and you'll get a much better view of things from Steven milord Knowles if I may post a query to you that has been causing me great anguish and any sleepless nights it would bring me joy to my heart and solace to my immortal soul to be illuminated by your light also I'd love to hear your thoughts why can't someone who murders a pregnant woman be charged with two counts of murder why can they while abortionists are paid to legally commit one of those murders often with our tax dollars via Medicaid do our friends on the Left ever acknowledge this obvious moral and legal contradiction and if so how do they square that circle also if abortion were made illegal by a clear law or constitutional amendment would you support murder charges for doctors who continued this barbaric practice many thanks and God bless you Steve yeah there is a willful ignorance I think and the lefties who want to square that circle I do think there's a willful ignorance I do understand how someone could honestly support abortion and not think that it's murder and the way that they could do that is by saying it's not murder no a woman needs autonomy of her body a woman it's unfair that women have this particular issue and men don't have that and that's unfair and so it's not murder what are you sure yeah I'm sure how is it it kind of looks like murder no no it's not murder it's a willful ignorance it's like in The Giver by Lois Lowry and there's this scene in the movie too and in the book where they're talking the people these automatons in this utopian society without any history they are they kill babies they killed what they consider to be defective babies and you see I remember in the movie you see the person look and say oh my how are they killing those babies and they say they don't know they're doing it they don't realize they're killing babies they're just doing it so that's how they that's how they don't square that circle as for murder charges for abortionists yeah if it were against the law if there were a constitutional amendment defining the beginning of life or acknowledging the beginning of life or a law or something you would not only would I support murder charges for those people breaking the law and committing murder according to the law everyone would have to support that right you're basically the law is defining this as it as murder or as morally similar to murder so you would if that is how the law is defining it you would have to support law enforcement and the the reason that it's important to bring this up is is like the Dred Scott decision this is why the abortion issue is a lot like the slavery issue the central premise for the American nation is natural rights so the Dred Scott decision is actually a great decision it's the wrong decision but it throws the issue into stark relief which is freed blacks can't become American citizens if if there is slavery that is tolerated in the country the country's premise ton natural rights that we're endowed by our Creator with a net with natural rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but those come in nature those are innate so either blacks have natural rights or they don't have natural rights if they do have natural rights you can't tolerate slavery as an intolerable evil if they don't have natural rights then they could never attain to American citizenship which is premise on natural rights you can't gain something which is natural same thing with abortion either human life is sacred from the beginning either humans have dignity from the beginning or they don't and if they don't have dignity from the beginning then when do you get it I don't know maybe around 27 or something 29 how do we differ only smart people have dignity only retarded babies they don't have dignity oh if they're they're missing a couple limbs they don't have dig they don't get dignity oh no when you're sleeping you lose your dignity it doesn't make sense they either have the rights are they they either have human dignity or they don't add or have rights to Liberty or they don't and so by throwing that in to struck relief I think I think you'd end up within a logically a necessary conclusion from Ronald hi Michael I have a dating question bring it on baby I am subscribed to Catholic match we're just a side note I have been dating sweet little ELISA since before these apps were necessary so I did miss this whole area but now there are matches for everything they're Catholic Jewish gay straight polygamous I think so that's cool I'm Gavin match sounds like a good one as far as they go where we can compare our temperaments with those of other subscribers should I look for someone with a similar temperament to mine or should I look for someone with an opposing temperament who can balance out my negative traits thanks I think you should look for someone who has a similar outlook and prynt temperament who sees the world with similar premises but has a different temperament and it's because men and women are not supposed to be the same men and women aren't the same they're not identical there that's why there are men and there are women if they were the same there we wouldn't have two words for it they would be the same thing so you want to be complementary the sexes are complementary to one another I can say from personal experience sweet little ELISA it has in many ways a different temperament than I do and and does balance out a lot of things and gives me another perspective but you do want a similar premises you don't want someone who sees the world fundamentally different than you do that doesn't really work I don't think that's just you you you need to begin from the same place and you'll disagree and you'll complement one another but I do think it's much easier if you for instance you don't need to date someone who's conservative who likes Donald Trump or something but you might want to date someone who is dispositional e conservative you know who kind a small C or something like that shares those premises with you it'll just make it a lot easier especially with the raising of children next question from Marg I knew it hearing what Juanita said about Bill telling her not to worry that he was sterile proved what I said all along about him not being Chelsea's father his medical records were never released and I knew it was to hide something like that my brother and I were roundly criticized for making that claim we both said that web Hubbell is her father he'll and he were tight at the law firm she worked in and he died under interesting circumstances just a little too soon like so many people she and bill know great interview with Juanita may her book sell multiple millions of copies and bring you all bring all you little crumb catchers crumb crunchers up to speed on how evil these people are she was absolutely correct that the atmosphere that existed at that time victims didn't say squat they assumed guilt for what happened to them the perps got away with it and became further emboldened because we didn't speak up love your show keep the cuff fa coming Marg Thank You Marg to begin on this it is a wise child that knows his own father to quote Telemachus regarding his ostensibly his father Odysseus it is a wise child that knows his own father second Bill Clinton is a liar is of famous libraries lying is like the defining feature Bill Clinton so here's the trouble with the bill isn't Chelsea's father story one I don't care i sir I truly don't care if I don't hear from the Clintons ever again in my life that's fine by me that'll be too soon but in so much as we're talking about it the the thing we're basing bill not being Chelsea's father on is something that bill told the woman that he just raped that he's in Bill Clinton the biggest liar telling a woman that he just violated as he's saying other vile things so even if Bill were telling wanita Broderick the truth we just can't take his word for it his word isn't credible at all and I don't know I mean it's you know Bill Clinton Bill Clinton is a liar so actually his telling Juanita Broderick that he was sterile makes me almost certain that he is Chelsea's father but who knows I know the Clintons are very depraved people so you know her father might be like some alien from outer space for all I know from Kellie Knowles you were incremental II converting my husband to Catholicism cut it out just kidding but in all seriousness my husband and I are a evangelical Christians last night we had a long talk about whether or not we should move to Catholicism because of you that's very nice to hear but here's my hesitation I had Peter Kreeft as a philosophy professor in college and he explained to us that he converted to Catholicism because for him the choice was life or death if he did not convert he knew he would die I took him seriously and do not feel that I am incomplete without the Catholic faith and so I should not convert does this seem accurate to you or is this position more extreme than is warranted thanks Kelly the latter it's more extreme than is warranted I'm very pleased to hear though that you're considering coming on over you know I I also when I reverted to Christianity I read a lot of Protestants and it was in many ways Protestants who pulled me closer and then I went whole hog into the the Church Universal to paraphrase an Orthodox Jewish friend of mine too the problem with your dilemma here theology doesn't care about your feelings if I don't know I fear there's some guy I know wanders around the halls here who says something similar to that I'm reading a book right now that coincidentally drew Clavin also happens to be reading by a philosopher named Alistair McIntyre called after virtue and in it McIntyre correctly identifies emotivism as the dominant moral framework of our age and emotivism is feelings it's the feelings of the facts don't care about your feelings right it's the ideas in some ways it's the facts too but that's and for another episode it's the idea that ethical and value judgments aren't really statements of fact murder is wrong is it really a statement of fact but rather they're merely expressions of feeling or preference or attitude you say murder is wrong I say murder is wonderful and fun and exhilarating who's to say who's right who's to say so the emotivist says when when we say things like murder is wrong what we're really just doing is using a rhetorical technique to mask what are nothing more than our individual preferences here's how this ties in to the to Christianity in America and Catholicism it seems quite clear to me that in America it is the individualistic character of Protestantism that has brought emotivism to the forefront of popular culture this feelings based pseudo moral framework MacIntyre coincidentally agrees with this actually as do a great many other observers of cultural and intellectual history that we on the right all love shot bars and among them as well this is why you can observe it this is why so many Protestant churches keep changing their minds on foundational moral issues not just among the countless evangelical churches but even mainline Protestant churches huge splits within just the past few decades within the Presbyterian Church in America the Episcopal Church McIntyre I'll also point out converted to Catholicism not long after he wrote his book fairly shortly afterward in a way that's were reminiscent of GK Chesterton who took a little bit longer but also converted to Catholicism after writing orthodoxy I hope that helps I hope that helps guide you in your dilemma from nathan michael huge fan of your show our wives were dorm mates back in the day and i was wondering if you would help spread the word about a piece of compromised legislation i'm hoping to make catch on to shift the gun control bait in our favor first of all i remember your lovely wife i do remember her and i remember hearing about you and so i'm thanks for watching the show i appreciate that i won't say your names or what you do because I don't want your association with the daily wire to destroy your careers and reputations you know what your boss to find out you subscribe but very nice to hear from you he says the founders were clear that arms and common use should be available to the public I propose to restrict access to the purchase of all semi-automatic firearms to the age of 25 when the brain has fully developed as with rental car purchases unless having completed a weapon safety course as the Canadians require I've been calling it the well-regulated militia bill because the extra training is the desired outcome and not necessarily having to wait until 25 the second part of this bill would be the concealed carry reciprocity for all honorable honorably discharged veterans cheers Bubba PS get Geoff Durbin on your show to help set your heretical ways straight I could try to do that you know Geoff sounds like a perfectly nice guy and everything but whenever I want a Protestant to come on this show and punish me for my potpourri I usually call Allie Stuckey and because that's the closest that I ever get to fifty shades of gray so don't deprive me of that as for the bill I like the second part I don't like the first part there is no constitutional right to rent a car that's why companies can restrict it to 25 although some don't I rented cars at a younger age there's a great company called rent-a-wreck which rents two people below 25 a lot of states like my own already a restrict handgun ownership to age 21 and above California is an example of this the vast majority of gun deaths are from handguns though of course two-thirds of those are just suicides there so they're not homicide suicide by middle-aged man well over 21 double 21 triple 21 the media make hay about semi-automatic rifles but there is no crisis or epidemic in America on this semi-automatic rifles were involved in a relatively small number of homicides each year mass shootings have been on a steep decline since the early 1990s as have school shootings despite what the media would tell you the mainstream media pretend there's a crisis that these shooting is in these deaths are increasing that semi-automatic rifles are the cause because they want to take away your guns they want to take guns from Americans they'll do it any way they can the purpose of the Second Amendment is to protect Liberty when the zombie apocalypse strikes young men are going to be doing the fighting so they probably should have some experience with guns as for the suggestion that they can bump the age back down if they just take some safety course or take some gun shoot marksman course I actually I don't see the logic of that because what we're saying is that the only way that mass potential mass shooters can get guns is if we teach them how to shoot them better but I don't want to teach them how to shoot them better I would much rather they be bad shots and not clean their guns and have it blow up in their face that would be that's fine by me I think we should bar those people from taking safety courses then largely the mainstream media premises just aren't true so my question is on this bill why why give them an inch there isn't there is a declining problem what we have done for the last 10 years is is working the American people hate gun control they have always hated gun control Democrats always lose elections when they harp on gun control all of the crime numbers are declining and the guns that they want to ban are not the issue forget their premises keep common cuff effe keep your constitutional rights and Kofi Fay as for concealed carry reciprocity for honorably discharged vet yeah sounds great let's do it tell your wife I said hello from Nathan future st. Michael how much more time do we have we got a ton for one more we got time alright from Nathan future Saint Michael yeah thank you I appreciate that's very nice am i appropriate and my question might be more appropriate for Ben but I want to give you a chance to answer a question that doesn't have to do with Catholicism that's good at first it's a first run in a while my wife had a traumatic brain injury thirteen years ago she's physically fine but her communication ability is severely impaired she receives federal disability benefits probably will for the rest of her life unless entitlement rules change in the early years of her receiving benefits they were a great help to us but as my own salaries grown the benefits are no longer critical to our financial well-being it's not a lot of money but it does give us some breathing room in our budget we have three kids she's obviously a stay-at-home mom even if she never had the injury by this point in her life she would most likely not be working outside the home in order to raise our children in principle we think a safety net is an okay idea but only in a society with a flat tax in our opinion the current tax and entitlement arrangement is a transfer of wealth instead of being a fair social contract so my question is how we justify receiving benefits from an entitlement program we disagree with the ever expanding entitlement programs are a huge problem how do we justify being part of the problem even if we are legally entitled to the current benefits we receive what are your thoughts on this ethical dilemma we will always vote in ways that would reduce entitlement spending but should my wife voluntarily discontinue the benefit also since we have children this is no longer a question that only involves us turning down money could be irresponsible in our part thanks Nathan PS I know you will one day be declared a saint because every passing day that Ben has not fired you as another miracle that is too true man that is evidence of grace and Providence I'm sorry to hear about your wife's injury to your question it's not an ethical dilemma at all I don't think it's even close to an ethical dilemma you're probably a better man for agonizing over this but no it isn't at all do you pay taxes to support entitlement programs that you disagree with then you should take the benefits of course you do you've paid it you're taking the money because you're entitled to it the problem with entitlements is not that people aren't entitled to it it's the people are entitled to it and the spending gets out of control you shouldn't unilaterally disarm that isn't going to do anything because then you're just paying into your gonna continue to pay and fund these programs for other people to take out other people are going to take it out I promise you that and the problem still won't be solved the this is a tactic of the left they do somewhat frequently they try because we have standards and they have nothing but double standards so they you know that we have standards they say you have to live up to that standard even if the framework of the country even if the framework of policy undercuts that but you should do it anyway and it's of no benefit to anybody it's just a tactic used by lefties absolutely not take the benefit and continue to vote for entitlement reform we need entitlement reform I'm not sure if this would even affect really your your family's situation here but we do need Medicare Medicaid and Social Security reform that's not going to happen because you punish yourself and your family and decide not to take money that you've already paid into absolutely not I understand the feeling that you don't like taking money from the government but that that's what's so insidious is we live country with this massive expanding entitlement program the problem isn't that you're getting a check the problem is that we have a massive entitlement program attack that don't don't create separate rules for you that other people don't have to follow it won't help anybody I hope that helps that is our entire show make sure over the weekend that you listen to another Kingdom Andrew clave ins narrative podcast that I perform all the roles in it is all out there you can binge the whole thing all thirteen episodes we are hard at work on season two and by we I mean drew is writing it and I am smoking cigars and drinking but he's writing it so we are anywhere team so we're hard oh I am I'm smoking a lot of cigars and drinking a lot so I go over there make sure you listen to all of that and I will see you on Monday I'm Michael malls this is the Michael Nolt show the Michael Knoll show is a daily wire forward publishing production executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey supervising producer Mathis Glover our technical producer is austin stevens edited by alex Zingara audio is mixed by Mike Cora Mina hair and makeup is by Jeshua ov era copyright forward publishing 2018
