a new documentary called in the executioners shadow pulls back the curtain on the subject of capital punishment through three different stories claiming races at the heart of decision-making when it comes to the death penalty in America my team a mistake pride and they were getting this person ready for his next step in life you gotta let towards the wall into the Chi homie he said it would get no benefit it's a good thing that I didn't kill him he didn't do anything wrong you don't know because you want my shoes recent figures reveal black people make up around 41% of those on death row while making up only about a 13% of the entire US population excuse me in addition they are far more likely to be given death sentences in cases of interracial killings well we spoke to those behind this film the racial application of the death penalty is that not not to look so much at the skin color of the perpetrator but the skin color of the victim if the if the murder victim is white then the prosecuting attorney is 4 to 11 times more likely to seek a death penalty than if the victim were black and so what message is the justice system sending to society one way that it can be interpreted is that white life is worth more than black life we're going to punish people who kill a white person more severely than we are if the victim or black for every nine executions there is one exoneration so for every nine inmates executed one person is found to be innocent I think that's the most startling in in the context of the innocence and how egregious this could be and as our executioner the Jerry Givens are the former executioner for the state of Virginia States one of the things that I think is really something that he expresses so well in the film is is this idea that it's it's an imperfect system we're human we make errors and there are errors being made in the criminal justice system and as long as that's true we should not be executing people
