so this morning many people are wondering how these upcoming talks will go down between President Trump and Kim jong-un the two have been trading insults for months and the president's language has been especially colorful nobody ever mentions of North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there I wouldn't go there if he came here I'd accept him but I wouldn't give him a steak dinner best not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime little rocket man he is a sick puppy Kim jong-un hasn't backed down either last September II called the president mentally deranged and stated that a frightened dog barks louder on top of all this there's the open question of where these talks will take place if there's any indication of president Trump on where he will not go it's this tweet back in 2014 quote crazy Dennis Rodman is saying I want to go to North Korea with them never discussed no interest last place on earth I want to go - all right the prospects of direct talks with North Korea spurring a lot of mixed emotions from some people doing cartwheels over the whole thing - trepidation and skepticism that's because if these talks do happen president Trump would be the first sitting American president to meet with a North Korean leader let's see what we know about the guy he's gonna meet with Kim jong-un the man Donald Trump is going to meet with face to face he's the third member of his family to rule the reclusive communist state in fact he's been the third leader of it since it's been the state of North Korea he succeeded his father in 2011 his childhood is shrouded in secrecy he's known to have attended an english-language school in Switzerland under a fake name which is apparently where he developed a fascination with basketball he was apparently a pretty good basketball player back in the day and that fascination led to the Dennis Rodman's first visit to North Korea in 2013 since 2000 and since he's come to power in 2011 he's worked to establish himself as a revolutionary leader he's ordered the construction of lavish westernized buildings he's put on massive military displays and of course he is pushed to advance the country's nuclear program his regime continues to be tainted by reports of human rights abuses the UN's latest report on North Korea found that the government continues to commit various crimes against humanity including extermination murder and slave menteur Chur imprisonment and rape the health examination of a North Korean defector who escaped across the DMZ the Demilitarized Zone into South Korea you remember this had happened last year hinted at the poor conditions their South Korean doctors found him malnourished and full of parasites which brings me to this three Americans remain prisoners of war in North Korea whether President Trump will make their return a priority remains to be seen none of these three have been seen seen since June of last year and that's where american student otto warmbier was released and returned to the United States he suffered brain damage had fallen into a coma during a 17 month detention he died six days after arriving in Ohio on a stretcher for more on this I want to bring in NBC's chief global correspondent Bill Neely who is very very familiar with this bill I you know normally we use you to report on things but I think I need to use you for your expertise today and ask you quite simply what I would ask the most sophisticated analysts of this what do you make of this development in the last 24 hours what does a guy like you who's been to South Korea many times who's followed this very closely what do you think of this Ally I think every capital in the world has been astonished at this development and this will be a summit meeting like no other remember Kim jong-un has never met a single foreign leader president Trump's met a few and he's alienated as many as he's clicked with so you know here are two strong-willed mavericks if you like largely untested leaders 171 the other maybe 36 as you said we just don't know that much about Kim Jong they've insulted each other they've threatened each other and their meeting about nuclear weapons with no preconditions and possibly with little preparation because Ali is you know most summits start with low-level meetings often with people called Sherpas then with secretaries of state and then finally the leaders at the very end but by agreeing to meet Kim first Donald Trump's up ending all of that so look this isn't like any other summer you know I covered Clinton Yeltsin in 1993 I remember then there was talk of these two strong unpredictable leaders what would happen it's closer to Reagan Gorbachev thinking yeah in 1986 yeah you know a sudden meeting discussing ridding ridding the world of nuclear weapons and failing to agree and yet they were two men who took a risk and within a year there was a nuclear deal it was a historic summit it was a huge gamble yeah so this one - someone's described this meeting as the equivalent of a Hail Mary pass but of course as you've been saying the key question is how do we know Kim's genuine or is he just playing a bad hand very well playing president moon and now playing Donald Trump buying time for his nuclear program as North Korea has always done Ally so you bring a good point up president moon of South Korea the new president of South Korea has been in favor of direct talks with North Korea for a long time you are one of very few Westerners who have been to North Korea this is a country that is not only attached to his nucleus nuclear program but unlike Iran which didn't want to give up its nuclear program north Korea has very little else it's the biggest thing about North Korea the North Koreans have said to you they won't get and now and others they won't give up their nuclear program it has anything changed in their thinking are they desperate for money and food and relations with the west enough that they might trade some of it away well as we've been hearing me there there is the theory that actually these sanctions are biting that North career for example might be a but to run out of foreign currency but back to your point I was told I think at least three times by senior officials in North Korea over a couple of years that there is no way they will give up their nuclear weapons it's their shield against the United States it's a bargaining chip it's Kim jong-un's weapon of survival if you like for his regime why would he give it up North Korea also has always craved not just the respect of the world but especially the United States and Kim jong-un is getting that night just like that you know it's been his real goal chiefly of course to get the United States off the Korean Peninsula the other real goal of course is you know reunifying the the two Koreas you know what is Donald Trump getting here you know he's already risking enormous political capital that because of his presence he's giving that away if you like straight away and it's not clear what the reward might be you know is it a peace treaty finally with North Korea to end the Korean war formally that won't be enough a freeze on nuclear weapons again not enough getting rid of North Korea's nuclear weapons is the stated American goal we know how long the Iran deal took the deal that Donald Trump hates so much you know how complex that was so any deal with North Korea will be extremely difficult it'll need to be verifiable yeah you know I know you know it's the world's most closed most secretive country so it's not easy lots of uncertain rewards here lots of huge risks and we had a lot more information about Iran when negotiating that deal than we do about about North Korea bill don't ever be far from a camera in the next few months because we're gonna need a lot of your analysis and coverage as this gets closer thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
