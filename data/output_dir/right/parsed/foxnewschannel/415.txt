THE PRESIDENT IS NOT PULLING
ANY PUNCHES AND BRINGS US TO
OUR HEADLINER KELLYANNE CONWAY
TO THE NORTH LAWN.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING.
>> Bill: TWO THINGS I WANT TO
SET UP WITH.
THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT IN
MISSISSIPPI SAID THE FOLLOWING
ABOUT DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY.
JUST A QUICK CLIP FROM THAT.
WATCH.
>> President Trump: 36 YEARS
AGO THIS HAPPENED.
I HAD ONE BEER, RIGHT?
I HAD ONE BEER.
WELL, YOU THINK -- NOPE, IT WAS
ONE BEER.
GOOD.
HOW DID YOU GET HOME?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
HOW DID YOU GET THERE?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
>> Bill: THAT COMMENT HAS
GOTTEN A LOT OF REACTION.
SOME PEOPLE THINK HE WAS
MOCKING HER.
OTHERS SUGGESTED HE WAS
POINTING OUT INCONSISTENCIES IN
HER STORY.
WHATEVER IT IS, SUSAN COLLINS,
A CRITICAL VOTE IN THIS A
MOMENT AGO TALKED TO OUR FOX
CREW ON CAPITOL HILL AND SAID
THE FOLLOWING ABOUT THOSE
COMMENTS.
JUST ROLL THIS QUICKLY.
>> THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS
WERE JUST PLAIN WRONG.
>> Bill: IT WAS THAT SIMPLE AND
SHORT.
YOUR REACTION ON THAT,
KELLYANNE.
WERE THEY WRONG, WERE THEY
UNNECESSARY?
WHAT IS THE POSITION ON THAT?
>> BILL, SINCE THE ACCUSER WAS
REVEALED IN THE "WASHINGTON
POST" STORY SOME 17 DAYS AGO,
EVERYBODY INCLUDING THIS WHITE
HOUSE, THIS PRESIDENT, THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS BEEN
INCREDIBLY ACCOMMODATING TO HER
WISH TO TESTIFY, TO GIVING HER
THE SPACE AND DEFERENCE SHE
NEEDED TO DO SO.
SHE PROVIDED HER TESTIMONY.
SHE STILL HAS NO CORROBORATION
FOR HER TESTIMONY.
THERE IS STILL NO EVIDENCE, NO
WITNESSES THAT CONFIRMED AS FAR
AS WE KNOW.
AN EXPANDED F.B.I.
INVESTIGATION.
WE AREN'T MICROMANAGING THIS
PROCESS.
WE HAVE ALLOWED -- WE HAVE SAID
SURE, IF THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE WANTS TO HAVE THE
F.B.I. INVESTIGATE A LITTLE
FARTHER, THEN THEY'RE DOING
THAT.
WE ARE NOT MANAGING THE SCOPE,
THE WITNESSES, ANYTHING LIKE
THAT.
AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRESIDENT
IS POINTING OUT FACTUAL
INCONSISTENCIES.
BY FORD'S OWN TESTIMONY THERE
ARE GAPS IN HER MEMORY, THERE
ARE FACTS THAT SHE CANNOT
REMEMBER.
HOW SHE GOT HOME, HOW SHE GOT
THERE.
WHERE THE HOUSE WAS, WHAT THE
DATE WAS.
IF THOSE PRETENDING THEY WANT
TO FIND THE TRUTH, DON'T SAY WE
CAN'T FIND THE TRUTH WHEN SHE
DOESN'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS.
THAT'S PART OF THE TESTIMONY
SHE PUT IN UNDER SWORN
STATEMENTS.
LOOK, DELAY HAS NOT BEEN A
FRIEND TO HER, EITHER.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE FROM HER LIFE
COMING FORWARD WANTING TO SAY
THINGS.
YOU HAVE THE REVELATION BY
SENATOR HATCH THAT PERHAPS DR.
FORD'S OWN ATTORNEYS MAY HAVE
VIOLATED A STANDARD UNDER THE
ABA IN NOT PROVIDING HER THE
OPTION THAT THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE REPUBLICANS
OFFERED HER, TO TESTIFY
PRIVATELY IN CALIFORNIA.
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO HER.
THEN THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
CAMERAS AND THE ATTORNEYS
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THEIR MOMENT
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.
SO THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT, I
THINK, SATELLITES FLOATING
AROUND THE CORE ISSUE HERE,
SHOULD BRETT KAVANAUGH BE
CONFIRMED TO THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT AS A NOMINEE?
SO FAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEER
AND ICE THIS WEEK.
>> Sandra: WILL HE BE CONFIRMED
BUT BEFORE THAT WE NEED TO KNOW
WHEN THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION
WILL WRAP.
HAVE YOU OR THE WHITE HOUSE,
THE PRESIDENT, RECEIVED ANY
UPDATES YOU CAN SHARE WITH US
ON THE INVESTIGATION.
>> YOU SEE WHAT LEADER
MCCONNELL SAID PUBLICLY.
HE IS SCHEDULING A VOTE THIS
WEEK.
COULD FILE CLOTURE VERY SOON.
AND THAT THE F.B.I.
INVESTIGATION THAT WAS
REQUESTED BY MEMBERS OF THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,
INCLUDING JEFF FLAKE, SAID THAT
HE WANTED IT TO NOT BE LONGER
THAN A WEEK.
IF THE F.B.I. FEELS THAT IS
AMPLE TIME FOR THEM TO EXECUTE
ON THE LIMITED SCOPE OF THE
INVESTIGATION.
REMEMBER, THIS IS NOT A
CRIMINAL OR CIVIL PROCEEDING.
IT IS PURSUANT TO THE SENATE
CONFIRMATION HEARING OF JUDGE
KAVANAUGH TO THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT.
WE NOW HAVE A SUPREME COURT
WITHOUT ITS NINTH JUSTICE AND
YOU SEE A LOT OF THE POLLS
WHERE AMERICANS WANT THIS TO
COME TO ITS COMPLETION.
SPEAKING OF POLLING, I WANT TO
MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR I HAVEN'T
HEARD OTHERS MENTION.
FOR ALL THE SCREAMING THAT THIS
IS HELPING THE HARD LEFT, WHICH
IS THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC PARTY
AND ENERGIZING ITS BASE AND AN
EXTENDED PART OF THE #METOO
MOVEMENT, ETC.
ONLY IF THE VICTIMS OF THE
#METOO MOVEMENT ARE DEMOCRATS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S
TWEET AFTER JUDGE KAVANAUGH
TESTIFIED HE GOT OVER 300,000
LIKES WITHIN 24 HOURS.
THAT'S A LOT OF LIKES FOR A
PRESIDENTIAL TWEET AND YOUR OWN
PRIME TIMELINE-UP ON THAT SAME
NIGHT THURSDAY FOLLOWING THE
HISTORIC TESTIMONY, YOU HAD 5.3
MILLION VIEWERS IN YOUR PRIME
TIMELINE-UP.
BUT IT TELLS ME THAT THE
PRESIDENT FOCUSING ON THE
SUPREME COURT AND THAT FOLKS
WHO CARE ABOUT THE SUPREME
COURT ARE VERY FOCUSED ON WHAT
WE WANT TO POP OUT OF THIS AND
FINISH UP WITH KELLYANNE CONWAY.
YOU ARE LISTENING TO THIS,
KELLYANNE.
YOU DROPPED A BIT OF A HEADLINE
THE OTHER DAY ON SUNDAY WHEN
YOU WERE BEING INTERVIEWED
SAYING THAT YOU WERE A VICTIM
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT YOURSELF AND
AS YOU LISTEN TO MITCH
MCCONNELL AND FOLLOWED THIS
DEBATE OF DR. FORD AND THE
CONFIRMATION VOTE OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH, WHAT MORE DO YOU
WANT TO ADD ABOUT THE CONTEXT
THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR OWN LIFE
ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU
HAVE BROUGHT TO THIS ISSUE?
>> NONE, I DON'T INTEND TO BE
THE STORY AND IT WASN'T PLANNED
BUT I WILL REPEAT THE FULL
SENTENCE FOR YOU BECAUSE I
DIDN'T LEAVE IT AT THAT.
I PUT COMMA, THEREFORE, I DON'T
HOLD ALL MEN RESPONSIBLE FOR
THAT.
I HOLD THE PERPETRATOR
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.
AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE
JUDGING THE HARM, THE GRIEF,
AND THE IMPACT ON THOSE WHO
HAVE SUFFERED SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULT,
RAPE.
WE SHOULDN'T JUDGE THAT
ACCORDING TO THEIR POLITICS.
AND WHETHER YOU WORK FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHETHER YOU'RE
A LIFE LONG REGISTERED DEMOCRAT
OR HAVE DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEYS.
CERTAINLY WHETHER YOU ARE
NOMINATED TO THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT BY PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
SO THAT WAS MY ENTIRE POINT
THAT NOW WE'RE BLAMING ALL MEN,
MITCH MCCONNELL BEING CHASED
THROUGH AN AIRPORT WITH THE
FOUR LETTER WORD RAPE BEING
THROWN AT HIM.
IT'S A DISGRACE AND THE COUNTRY
SEES IT.
A LOT OF POLLS, A LOT OF VOTERS
HUMMING ALONG AGREEING BUT NOT
INTENSELY SO, ARE SWINGING BACK
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LATEST POLL.
THAT'S NOT A GREAT POLL USUALLY
FOR REPUBLICANS AND
CONSERVATIVES BECAUSE PEOPLE
ARE WATCHING THIS AND THEY DO
WORRY ABOUT THE MEN IN THEIR
LIFE.
THEY DO WORRY ABOUT THE IMPACT
GOING FORWARD OF WHAT THIS
MEANS.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT
BLAMING AN ENTIRE GENDER FOR
WHAT INDIVIDUAL MEN HAVE DONE
AND THAT WE'RE NOT JUDGING
PEOPLE AND THE DEFERENCE THEY
SHOULD BE GIVEN OR BEING
TREATED LIKE AN EGG OR BEING
TREATED LIKE CRAP BASED ON
THEIR POLITICS AND WHERE THEY
WORK.
MAY I SAY ONE THING LEADER
MCCONNELL SAID IT PERFECTLY.
THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT MANY
RANK AND FILE VOTERS ARE
FEELING.
WE HEAR FROM THEM CONSTANTLY.
NOTHING WILL EVER BE GOOD
ENOUGH NOT JUST FOR THE
DEMOCRATS ON THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE BUT ALL THOSE NOT
VOTING FOR KAVANAUGH.
IF YOU'RE A RED STATE DEMOCRAT
YOU'RE CHOOSING BETWEEN BEING
COMPLICIT IN A PROCESS THAT'S
BEEN ABOUT DELAY AND
DESTRUCTION AND THE WILL OF
YOUR PEOPLE IN THE STATE.
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE THREE
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO VOTED
FOR GORSUCH MANCHIN, HEITKAMP
AND DONLEY.
WHAT HAS CHANGED?
YOUR VOTERS WANT A SUPREME
COURT NOMINEE TO BE CONFIRMED.
THEY DON'T WANT THIS
OBSTRUCTION OR LIKE THE
SOCIALIST WAY THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY IS GOING.
>> Sandra: A CRITICAL POINT AND
MOMENT.
FRONT PAGE "NEW YORK TIMES" BIG
STORY FOR THEM.
YOUR REACTION FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE ON THEIR REPORTING TRUMP
ENGAGED IN SUSPECT TAX SCHEMES
AS HE REAPED RICHES FROM HIS
FATHER.
THIS REPORT, KELLYANNE, MAKES
THE CASE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
NOT A SELF-MADE MAN, THAT HE
HAS BEEN GIVEN MONEY FROM HIS
FAMILY SINCE HE WAS A CHILD,
AND THEY DID IT BY MEANS OF
COMPLICATED TAX SCHEMES AND
BEYOND.
>> AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID,
IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE HAS EVER
WITNESSED A MAJOR OUTLET TAKING
THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND
PUSHING IT FORWARD.
HIS ATTORNEY, CHARLES HARDER,
MADE CLEAR YESTERDAY THIS IS
100% INACCURATE AND THE PEOPLE
HIRED TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES
DECADES AGO WERE ALL
PROFESSIONALLY LICENSED AND
SWORE THEMSELVES THAT WHAT THEY
WERE ATTESTING TO WAS FACT AND
LEGAL.
SO THESE ARE CPAs, ATTORNEYS,
REAL ESTATE EXPERTS.
AND THAT HE DENIES THIS
COMPLETELY THROUGH HIS ATTORNEY
AND ALSO I THINK WHAT OUR PRESS
SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS SAID
YESTERDAY IS INSTRUCTIVE.
DOES THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER
SEE ANYTHING POSITIVE IN A
BOOMING ECONOMY?
JUST TODAY WE HAVE THE
PROJECTION OF 185,000 NEW JOBS
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT IT
WAS 230,000.
WHERE IS THAT?
WHERE IS THE HIGHEST STOCK
MARKET?
THE LOWEST EMPLOYMENT RATES.
THEY'VE NEVER MET A PIECE OF
GOOD NEWS UNDER THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION AND SAID THE
PRESIDENT IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
THIS HAS BEEN DENIED BY HIS
ATTORNEY, BY HIS PRESS
SECRETARY AND BY HIM AND I
THINK THE PLAY HERE IS TWO
THINGS, NUMBER ONE, I GUESS
THEY MOVED OFF RUSSIA COLLUSION.
IT OBSESSED THEM FOR TWO YEARS
AND HAVEN'T HEARD IT IN A WHILE.
AND NUMBER TWO THEY'RE TRYING
TO GOAD THE PRESIDENT INTO
SUING THEM TO GET HIGH TAX
RETURNS.
HAVEN'T THEY LEARNED THAT THE
PRESIDENT ALWAYS GETS THE LAST
LAUGH?
>> DO YOU HAVE A PREDICTION ON
THE KAVANAUGH VOTE.
DOES HE GET CONFIRMED AND
WHAT'S THE FINAL TALLY?
>> THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING
BEHIND HIS NOMINEE AND
RECOGNIZE THE RED STATE
DEMOCRATS ARE IN A DIFFICULT
POSITION.
COMPLICITY IN A DESTRUCTIVE
PROCESS THAT HURT FORD AND
KAVANAUGH AND DOING THE WILL OF
THEIR VOTERS.
>> Bill: THE SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT.
