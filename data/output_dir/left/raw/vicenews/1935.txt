1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
the sound science has been done when it

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes to climate change and those that</font>

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,400
aren't adhering to the the sound science

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,440
are doing it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons like ideology</font>

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">or you dismiss the science for whatever</font>

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,450
foolish reason you know you come up with

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,679
i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the they say is just crazy</font>

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,199
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm robert</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ashwin environment editor</font>

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,170
at vice news and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm joining on the line</font>

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,460
today to take your<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions about</font>

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,850
climate change and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment so</font>

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,280
who's up first Michael I Robert thanks

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,860

Robert good good oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I had a</font>

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,809
couple questions really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

19
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,629
political nature of climate change gets

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,030
a huge topic right now so my first

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,489
question is sort of a recent event of

22
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,270
Obama traveling to Alaska to study the

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,949
climate change to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring awareness so I</font>

24
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,140
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering what if anything do you</font>

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,689
think will happen after this<font color="#CCCCCC"> trip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

26
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,689
back in terms of policy changes any sort

27
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,520
of a lightning view like a politician

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,650
said this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scientist maybe we</font>

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">should listen to him like something like</font>

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,610
that do you think of anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,130
will happen after Obama returns well it

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,040
remains to be seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know obama obama</font>

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
went up there and on day one attended a

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,860
conference of foreign ministers from

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,229
arctic countries and sort of said the

36
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">same thing that he's that he and others</font>

37
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,310
who are demanding action on climate

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,439
change have said all along which is like

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,960
time is running out we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut</font>

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,090
greenhouse gas emissions and we've got

41
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,680
to do it at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this year at the</font>

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,619
UN climate talks in Paris he then went

43
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">on to look at some of the impacts of</font>

44
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,180
climate change some melting glaciers he

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,590
went and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at some indigenous</font>

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,869
communities along the coast<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

47
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,729
been impacted by<font color="#CCCCCC"> climate change but</font>

48
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,530
really this is like him doing what he

49
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,110
has done previously which is being a

50
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,659
champion for climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change but the the</font>

51
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,310
significant thing that happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with his</font>

52
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,740
trip I think was that environmentalists

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,170
pointed out a significant contradiction

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,650
in

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">his policies on one hand he's been a</font>

56
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,700
champion on climate change he's been

57
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,860
urging international action he's used

58
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,750
his executive authority in the united

59
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,989
states to impose rules that cut

60
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,730
greenhouse gas emissions from power

61
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,610
plants from automobiles but<font color="#CCCCCC"> he also</font>

62
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,870
green lighted oil drilling in the Arctic

63
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,310
he green-lighted shale drilling for oil

64
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,650
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coast of Alaska and so</font>

65
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,359
environmentalists really used and I

66
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,420
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> very successfully used Obama's</font>

67
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,489
trip up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Arctic to point out this</font>

68
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,400
contradiction<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some ways</font>

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,659
Obama's trip backfired a little bit he

70
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:51,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">went up there expecting to be sort of</font>

71
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,040
you know capture the headlines about

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,109
being a champion for climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change but</font>

73
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,819
really you know environmentalist pushed

74
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,889
the issue of his his contradictory

75
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,680
contradictory policies on on energy

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,530
development so we'll see what we'll see

77
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,959
what the fallout is of that I do you

78
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,720
think that this sort of going to Alaska

79
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,109
concept is more of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess seeing</font>

80
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,280
seeing is believing thing with other

81
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,459
politicians who haven't gone um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

82
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,680
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this the lines are pretty</font>

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,489
clearly drawn among America's political

84
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,329
class you know you have Obama many

85
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:30,299
Democrats some<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republicans although not</font>

86
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,430
many saying that yeah we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like</font>

87
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,349
produce more renewable energy we need to

88
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,629
cut greenhouse gas emissions but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

89
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:37,980
think Obama is necessarily going to

90
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,980
convince any elected official in the

91
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,549
united states that somehow that that was

92
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,500
against action to address climate change

93
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,449
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going to like turn</font>

94
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">the corner because of obama's trip but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

95
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,720
do think it highlighted you know the

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,799
issue of climate change<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how it's</font>

97
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,919
impacting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US now it's not some</font>

98
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,720
abstract thing that's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in</font>

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the future it's happening now in terms</font>

100
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,109
of glacier melt rising temperatures

101
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,569
wildfires community coastal communities

102
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:08,579
being impacted and so I think you know

103
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:11,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it elevates the issue but what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

104
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,599
that mean how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> translates into</font>

105
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,329
policy changes it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not clear</font>

106
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,159
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that that that it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

107
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,949
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and then last question is</font>

108
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,469
when you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these policy changes</font>

109
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,360
what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe the relationship</font>

110
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,979
between scientists and politicians

111
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,490
should be when talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

112
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,800
change because we see that some

113
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,479
politicians I know scientists<font color="#E5E5E5"> are wrong</font>

114
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,060
but not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a lot to back it up</font>

115
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,729
but should they be so intertwined in

116
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,949
politics that you don't know who you're

117
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,509
actually voting for if you're voting for

118
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,069
a politician or a scientist that backs

119
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,050
that politician so what do you take the

120
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,580
relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> which should be well I I</font>

121
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,099
think it there is very particular things

122
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,680
about the relationship between climate

123
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,530
scientists and politicians which is that

124
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,270
the science community is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the there's</font>

125
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,270
consensus on the fundamentals of<font color="#E5E5E5"> climate</font>

126
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,750
change that human generated emissions

127
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,110
are warming the planet and unless we cut

128
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,349
those emissions you know significantly

129
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,419
by mid-century we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font>

130
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,030
level of global temperature rise that

131
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,699
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't sustain that really</font>

132
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,470
impacts human societies significantly

133
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,650
with sea level rise with you know

134
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,569
increased precipitation in some areas

135
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,000
increased more frequent more severe

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,819
droughts and others more frequent

137
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,530
extreme weather events and so that

138
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,199
science is is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-founded it's</font>

139
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,479
established and some politic many

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,330
politicians adhere to what scientists

141
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,949
are recommending but many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them don't</font>

142
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,169
they just dismiss the the science out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

143
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,900
hand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think that I don't see</font>

144
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">that changing you know science</font>

145
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,419
scientists advise politicians I want to

146
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,900
advocate for a rule of experts obviously

147
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,580
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't i don't know that if that's what</font>

148
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,990
you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at but i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

149
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,030
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientists setting policy but i</font>

150
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,030
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want policy and you know laws</font>

151
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,069
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> united states based upon sound</font>

152
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,509
science and the sound science has been

153
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:11,949
done when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to climate change and</font>

154
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,229
those that aren't adhering to the the

155
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:16,479
sound science are doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for reasons</font>

156
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,849
like ideology<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't want government</font>

157
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,409
intervention<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the marketplace they</font>

158
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:23,440
don't want laws that restrict what power

159
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,870
plants can admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the air it's a</font>

160
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a philosophical choice for them to</font>

161
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,630
adhere to science that says you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

162
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,669
intervene in the market place to address

163
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,210
environmental pollution or you dismiss

164
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,740
the science for whatever foolish reason

165
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,479
you know you come up with i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

166
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,320
 they say is just

167
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,690
crazy you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like you know they</font>

168
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,460
and I don't see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> changing if like</font>

169
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,710
there's more reports I mean the reports

170
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are coming out or more severe</font>

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,790
they're narrowing in on some details

172
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,470
about how climate change is impacting

173
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,740
the atmosphere and oceans but you know I

174
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">think these scientific studies are going</font>

175
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,700
to going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue to come out they're</font>

176
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,080
going to continue to clarify what's

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,020
going on and the politicians that aren't

178
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,550
listening to those scientists are going

179
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,500
to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ignore the science all</font>

180
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
right all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thank you very</font>

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">much i agree questions thanks yeah all</font>

182
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,890
right thanks Matt today Robert we're

183
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,240
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> some tweets and I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this one that we got from Alex</font>

185
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,010
Alex wants to know how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oil</font>

186
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,650
and gas industry are going to play a

187
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,690
role in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> climate change debate what</font>

188
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,060
role do you think they<font color="#CCCCCC"> will play I think</font>

189
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're gonna play the exact same role</font>

190
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,230
that they've continued to play which is

191
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,320
to obstruct any sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> action</font>

192
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,670
internationally or domestically on

193
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,160
curbing emissions Michelle I mean

194
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,710
despite the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the science is</font>

195
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,700
pretty clear that whatever fossil fuel

196
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,890
reserves are in the ground and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

197
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,110
identified for by fossil fuel companies

198
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,450
those those reserves need to stand in

199
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ground they cannot be developed they</font>

200
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,490
cannot be burnt unless you really want

201
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,850
to set off a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of catastrophic level</font>

202
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,970
of global warming<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

203
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,220
have shale oil right now drilling for

204
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,870
doing exploratory drilling in the Arctic

205
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,720
Ocean looking for more oil and natural

206
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,370
gas deposits and there's a lot of it up

207
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but their interest is to generate</font>

208
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,140
profits for their investors and for

209
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,510
their shareholders and you know perhaps

210
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,770
there's going to be some fossil fuel

211
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,169
corporations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more forward</font>

212
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and transition make some sort of</font>

213
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,219
transition from developing oil and

214
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,799
natural gas deposits and you know

215
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,510
developing more wind and solar and

216
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,680
renewable energy sources but I don't see

217
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see them doing that on</font>

218
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,340
their own I see them doing that when

219
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,670
they're forced to by<font color="#E5E5E5"> societies</font>

220
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,860
and governments that restrict where and

221
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,370
what they they do cool well I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

222
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">answers your question Alex and you know</font>

223
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,360
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the oceans which about it a</font>

224
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,430
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit I know Heidi who's calling us</font>

225
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">on skype has a couple questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

226
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the oceans so let's say it I cool hey</font>

227
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,120
Heidi hi Robert thanks so much for being

228
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,000
here so I hear a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about the rising of</font>

229
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,190
sea levels the warming of surface

230
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,320
temperatures and also recently I've

231
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,810
heard about carbon dioxide levels

232
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,670
increasing which is altering the oceans

233
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,910
bacteria go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> food chain um can you</font>

234
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,950
elaborate have been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and how this</font>

235
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,240
is truly affecting the health of our

236
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,820
oceans yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think you you</font>

237
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,830
nailed it it's the the the oceans are

238
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,710
getting hotter they're absorbing the

239
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,260
majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the excess heat that's being</font>

240
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,640
trapped in the atmosphere it's going

241
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the excess heat is being trapped in</font>

242
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,550
the atmosphere because of all these

243
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,590
greenhouse gases and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is</font>

244
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,930
going into the oceans and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does two</font>

245
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,720
things it's it warms the oceans and it

246
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,210
makes them more acidic and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> warming</font>

247
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,530
oceans you see the breakdown of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

248
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,390
fundamental the very base of the food

249
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,320
chain you see species migrating to

250
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,940
different parts of the oceans you see

251
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,630
species dying out I mean they're the one

252
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,370
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really sums up a lot of</font>

253
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,020
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with climate change was</font>

254
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,640
there were researchers this spring that

255
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,700
found polar bears eating dolphins in

256
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,190
Norway and those dolphins you know they

257
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,580
they have their their habitat is that is

258
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't is pretty far north but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

259
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">spring and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry in the summer and</font>

260
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">so these dolphins are farther north</font>

261
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,100
because of warming ocean temperatures

262
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,020
and there are now in habitats where

263
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're cohabitating with bear with</font>

264
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,190
polar bears and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you see that's</font>

265
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,010
warming oceans are shifting around what

266
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,290
species reside where and during what

267
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,380
times of the year but then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as</font>

268
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,980
oceans become more acidic you know you

269
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,200
see thing you see like the great barrier

270
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
reef coral reefs<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Caribbean being</font>

271
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,040
affected and they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> also really</font>

272
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,770
crucial to ocean ecosystems in terms of

273
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,230
like habitat just places where fish and

274
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,450
other little ocean critters reside but

275
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,060
also how the food chain operates and

276
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,510
with warming ocean

277
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,350
you know going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Arctic the</font>

278
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,720
summer sea ice extent and the winter sea

279
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
ice extent for that matter has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

280
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,660
shrinking consistently year after year

281
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,340
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means is you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

282
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,310
affects weather patterns you know

283
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,660
throughout the world all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the globe</font>

284
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,470
and so the oceans are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

285
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,030
integrated like fully integrated into

286
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,580
the Earth's climate system and they're

287
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,620
being impacted by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you know we're</font>

288
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,860
 up the atmosphere well so with

289
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,840
the world's current state how how

290
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,580
rapidly are things becoming severe and

291
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,830
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> damage basically reversible you</font>

292
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,110
know species dying off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that like</font>

293
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,340
what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying the food chain I'm</font>

294
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,100
being disrupted like how how long do we

295
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,710
have until things are irreversible well

296
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,440
it there's already irreversible changes

297
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,570
i mean this spring a<font color="#CCCCCC"> us-based scientists</font>

298
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,070
every every year US government

299
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,350
scientists issue this their state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

300
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,630
climate report and this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> it focused</font>

301
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,550
very heavily on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state of the oceans</font>

302
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,410
and they say that many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes</font>

303
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,090
that we've seen or irreversible and

304
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,370
we're going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> mud and changes are</font>

305
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much more widespread and</font>

306
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,140
much deeper unless there's a significant

307
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,210
reduction in the amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pollution</font>

308
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,800
that humans are putting into the

309
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,280
atmosphere so you know it when is it a

310
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,720
reversible well that was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

311
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,670
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> these US scientists several</font>

312
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago well okay so my third and</font>

313
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,920
final question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about not about the</font>

314
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,080
ocean actually is about El Nino I'm

315
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearing this year it's gonna be globally</font>

316
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,670
like the worst we've had in 18 years so

317
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,080
can you speak a little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

318
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,640
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your knowledge about El Nino</font>

319
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,000
yeah well El Nino is in fact related to

320
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
the oceans because it is a naturally

321
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,320
occurring just for the benefit of those

322
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that don't know about el nino el ninos a</font>

323
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,770
naturally occurring phenomenon where

324
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,860
ocean temperatures become abnormally

325
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,680
warm in the eastern Pacific and this

326
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,820
generally happens it's part of the

327
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,010
natural climate system it happens every

328
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,820
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> to seven years now some scientists</font>

329
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,910
say that you put El Nino you graphed El

330
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,280
Nino on top of already hot ocean

331
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,310
temperatures and it spikes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intensity</font>

332
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,340
and so what that what that means is in

333
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,250
places along the east coast I'm sorry

334
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,779
the west coast of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

335
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">there'll be more intense rainfall which</font>

336
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,560
would be great for California

337
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,210
potentially because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's had the</font>

338
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,340
significant drought but El Nino also

339
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,360
causes the very hot dry conditions in

340
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,120
places like Indonesia Australia and the

341
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,790
Philippines and those places you know

342
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,970
Australia has been hit by extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

343
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,730
temperatures the last several years has

344
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,850
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a very intense wildfire</font>

345
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,790
seasons Indonesia of course has like

346
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,650
wildfires going on all the time because

347
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,150
they're making they're burning they're

348
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,830
slashing and burning<font color="#CCCCCC"> rainforest to make</font>

349
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,040
way for palm oil plantations and pulp

350
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,010
and paper plantations and so those all

351
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,810
of those conditions become exacerbated

352
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,150
by El Nino which is exacerbated

353
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,610
potentially it's the jury's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still out</font>

354
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,740
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> some scientists think that El Nino</font>

355
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,630
is becoming more intense perhaps more

356
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">frequent because of climate change but</font>

357
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:23,900
those were those are great questions

358
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,330
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you well thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you so much yeah</font>

359
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,790
you bet yeah thanks I do you for coming

360
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,339
on so Robert we're getting a bunch more

361
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,950
tweets and we saw two tweets actually on

362
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,040
the same topic Curtis wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what</font>

363
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,270
would you say to those people who claim

364
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,339
that the temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> increases are part</font>

365
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,130
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Earth's natural cycle and Marcus</font>

366
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,200
echoed that sentiment asking how much

367
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,480
merit does that argument carrie really

368
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,839
it has that much merit it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

369
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,260
it's complete the the science

370
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,570
has been sound there is little if any

371
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,880
disagreement among the science community

372
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,240
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that human generated</font>

373
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,089
greenhouse gases are causing the planet

374
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,360
to warm the role of natural of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

375
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,040
there is natural variability in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

376
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,740
Earth's climate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that variability</font>

377
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,500
that that fluctuation fluctuations sorry

378
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,240
temperature should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

379
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,770
and so it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

380
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,660
unequivocally unequivocally clear that

381
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,910
human beings are driving temperatures to

382
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,640
rise you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> atmosphere in the</font>

383
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,589
oceans it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not natural climate</font>

384
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:35,220
variability is not

385
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,139
you know at play here Nora's volcanoes

386
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,939
and whereas sunspots nor does any of

387
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,310
that it's human beings increasing

388
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,439
atmospheric temperatures which are being

389
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,420
absorbed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the ocean and it's</font>

390
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,730
it all up<font color="#CCCCCC"> so alien intervention is</font>

391
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,139
completely out as well there's no alien

392
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,790
interval well now you're talking about

393
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">something completely different but let's</font>

394
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it back let's get a vector climate</font>

395
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:57,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm gonna let Matt do that this is</font>

396
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:58,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matthew actually I would say to Matthew</font>

397
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:00,990
in Brooklyn hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matthew in Brooklyn hey</font>

398
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,370
good afternoon Robert nice to be here

399
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,670
nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you here or in your via</font>

400
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,290
video you're in your kitchen I guess

401
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,100
yeah so in recent years China has been

402
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,870
largely<font color="#CCCCCC"> criticized by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

403
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,600
community for its lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulation of</font>

404
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,569
carpet munitions and water pollution in

405
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,310
relation to these can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you speak to the</font>

406
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,199
role<font color="#CCCCCC"> that China plays in combating</font>

407
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,379
carbon emissions on a global scale um

408
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:27,149
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great question and in an</font>

409
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:30,029
extremely important one<font color="#E5E5E5"> China is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

410
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:32,579
right now the largest contribute annual

411
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:38,040
contributor to climb to it's got the

412
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,259
highest emissions of any nation in the

413
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,170
world I mean it's a huge country you

414
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it tops the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US so it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making a</font>

415
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,600
significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> contribution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to global</font>

416
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">climate change and so it's very</font>

417
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,069
important that<font color="#E5E5E5"> China reduce its</font>

418
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:56,399
emissions very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly if there's</font>

419
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,399
any chance of keeping global temperature

420
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,589
rise below<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 degrees Celsius</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

421
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,609
scientists say we must do in order to

422
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,709
avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of catastrophic consequences</font>

423
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,559
now the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is important about</font>

424
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,959
your question is China gets particularly

425
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,109
you know particularly with Republicans

426
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,270
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States China constantly</font>

427
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,419
gets accused of not doing anything about

428
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">climate change when in fact it's doing a</font>

429
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,230
lot of very significant things about

430
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,349
climate change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pledged to peak its</font>

431
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,100
emissions by 2030 it's unclear<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font>

432
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,809
that peak will be and what will<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

433
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">after the peak but it has its government</font>

434
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,130
has come forward and said we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

435
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,390
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> climate change we're going to</font>

436
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,730
curb emissions it's shutting down coal

437
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:46,200
plants it's trying to use cleaner lower

438
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,840
sulfur coal which is

439
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,640
which is basically to address a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

440
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,919
the air pollution<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns and cities</font>

441
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,330
like Beijing which have been blanketed

442
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,120
by you know really severe air pollution

443
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> China's doing a lot it's ramping up</font>

444
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,690
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wind and solar energy and so I</font>

445
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,490
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contributions have been</font>

446
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,270
as significant potentially even more

447
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,220
significant than say the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> States</font>

448
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I think you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

449
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,710
agreement there was a joint agreement

450
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,970
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US and China recently where</font>

451
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,980
both countries came forward with pledges

452
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,620
to reduce greenhouse gas<font color="#CCCCCC"> emissions those</font>

453
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,630
are great they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be enforced and</font>

454
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">they probably need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be increased you</font>

455
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,220
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the end of the year to</font>

456
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,570
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of send a message that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

457
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,330
two largest contributors to global

climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change are really taking it</font>

459
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,549
seriously it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to see</font>

460
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:43,460
these steps that Beijing takes around

461
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,539
important summits and meetings in their

462
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,620
capital city<font color="#E5E5E5"> they really go all out and</font>

463
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">cutting back total emissions yeah I do</font>

464
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,370
have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more question for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you though</font>

465
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,549
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fresh water in China</font>

466
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,220
and so what extent have the rivers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

467
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,720
lakes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> china have been affected by</font>

468
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,840
these pollution factors what do you mean

469
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,970
carbon pollution you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean climate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

470
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,220
talking more along the lines of water

471
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">pollution yeah well I mean the it's a</font>

472
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">China's rivers are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know essential to</font>

473
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,039
commerce to agriculture to human

474

consumption you know providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking</font>

475
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,580
water and<font color="#CCCCCC"> China faces very very serious</font>

476
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,549
environmental problems because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

477
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:31,770
amount of industry that's ramped up in

478
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,809
the last you know decade or so two

479
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:39,409
decades and it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow to impose</font>

480
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:42,779
environmental regulations but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

481
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,230
life in my view the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years</font>

482
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,230
particularly with the severe smog that's

483
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,169
hit its large cities on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> west coast I</font>

484
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:54,059
think it's cause somewhat of a

485
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,039
legitimacy legitimacy crisis for the

486
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,830
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

487
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,309
rising middle class in China saying like

488
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,799
you promised us you know if we worked

489
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,440
hard you know we achieve middle-class

490
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,530
status and then here we are blanketed in

491
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,100
in you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this smog in these</font>

492
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,799
cities and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really awful sort</font>

493
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,149
of lifestyle for people and they're

494
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">pissed and China has has tried to hide</font>

495
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the information about what its air</font>

496
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,220
quality is how poor<font color="#E5E5E5"> its air quality is</font>

497
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,840
and there's been a backlash I mean

498
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
there's there's environmental organizing

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,610
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> protests it's it's diff</font>

500
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,000
I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a reporter to China</font>

501
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,030
to really dig into the Chinese

502
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,380
environmental movement it's very

503
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,690
interesting it's a difficult thing to do

504
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,909
but it's it's very vibrant there's been

505
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,860
a lot of backlash about air quality

506
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,740
water quality in<font color="#CCCCCC"> China and i think</font>

507
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,559
that's that's that's probably it's

508
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,240
creating some pressure on the central

509
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,500
government to respond oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

510
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,659
all right Thank You Matthew so Robert

511
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're just about at the end of the show</font>

512
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got this tweet from rahul that i</font>

513
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,600
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at rel wants to know</font>

514
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,149
is it too late<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prevent a climate</font>

515
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:12,390
catastrophe and and you know if not what

516
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,679
are the odds that we're going to prevent

517
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,280
it or what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do yeah I mean I you</font>

518
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,590
know not to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it too complicated but</font>

519
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,600
you know there's already a climate

520
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,149
catastrophe for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people you know</font>

521
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,909
this summer you know July was the

522
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:31,530
hottest month on record you know how

523
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,350
does month ever recorded you know heat

524
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,289
waves earlier this year killed thousands

525
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:41,130
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> India and Pakistan so I</font>

526
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,260
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's catastrophic when</font>

527
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,419
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that level of human loss because</font>

528
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,970
the temperature rise just today there

529
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,950
was a report listed that the current

530
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,850
pledges to cut greenhouse gases will

531
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,940
likely lead to our insufficient and will

532
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,490
likely lead to three degrees<font color="#E5E5E5"> Celsius</font>

533
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,950
temperature rise compared to

534
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,220
pre-industrial age temperatures and that

535
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,350
means several<font color="#E5E5E5"> feet of sea level rise</font>

536
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,480
that means you know melting of the ice

537
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,030
caps that means melting glaciers and so

538
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,470
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i think is</font>

539
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,850
don't know that anybody would argue that

540
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not a catastrophe and so that's</font>

541
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,740
the situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so you know what are</font>

542
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,230
the odds of preventing it you know

543
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,059
that's that's the important question and

544
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that comes down to what how</font>

545
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:30,669
successful are environmentalists people

546
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:32,350
concerned about climate change how

547
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,970
successful are they at pressuring

548
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,720
governments to constrain polluters<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

549
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,490
constrain the marketplace into force

550
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,549
investment away from fossil fuel burning

551
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:45,580
and into you know renewable energy

552
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,030
sources all right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so there</font>

553
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,409
might be a little bit of hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us but</font>

554
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:52,480
they remembered thanks for coming on and

555
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,210

my job there you go so with that why you
