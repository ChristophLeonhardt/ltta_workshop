possibility of all good idea it seemed a

263
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,820
little far-fetched at first and then we

264
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,650
have this like isolated corner and we

265
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,940
just put a wall here and fill it with

266
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,940
balls home maybe that's a good idea and

267
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,560

268
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,800
