00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:05,326
THEM TO TAKE SOME OF THE FUNDS.

3
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:08,862
THEY DID SO BECAUSE THEY WERE

4
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:09,463
DESPERATE TO GET A DEAL.

ADMINISTRATION DELIBERATELY

8
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,972
MISLEADING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

9
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:18,706
BY GIVING IRAN OR ATTEMPTING TO

10
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:22,109
GIVE IRAN ACCESS TO THE US

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:22,710
FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN ITS

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,446
DESPERATION TO GET THE IRAN

13
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:27,414
NUCLEAR DEAL DONE.

14
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:29,416
>> BERRY ABOUT HER MILK SERVES

15
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,117
AS AN INTEL SPECIALIST IN THE

16
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:32,152
AIR FORCE.

17
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:35,255
HE JOINS US TO REACT.

18
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:35,990
ON THE ONE HAND THE FORMER STATE

19
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,793
DEPARTMENT COURT MADE A FOR THE

20
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:43,030
IRAN DEAL SAYING THIS IS WIDELY

21
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,397
OVERBLOWN.

22
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:44,131
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HEARD THE

23
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:44,865
SAME THING WE HEARD A MINUTE AGO

24
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:45,933
IN AN INTERVIEW.

25
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:47,167
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS?

26
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:50,571
>> IRONIC YOU HAD THE PREVIOUS

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY SAYING

29
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:58,112
TOO MANY DEALS WERE DONE BEHIND

30
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,846
CLOSED DOORS DONE BY THE STROKE

31
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:02,816
OF THE PRES.'S PLAN WITHOUT

32
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:03,550
ENGAGING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

33
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,184
GOING BEHIND THE HALLS OF

34
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:08,055
CONGRESS BUT THAT WAS DONE HE

35
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:08,455
REPEATEDLY.

36
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:09,189
THE ADMINISTRATION REPORTED TO

37
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:14,495
CONGRESS THEY WOULD HAVE NO

38
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:15,195
ACCESS TO AMERICAN FINANCIAL

39
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:15,929
SYSTEM BUT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

40
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,865
WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN THEY

41
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:25,472
ARE GIVING LICENSE AWAY.

42
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:26,240
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THE LEVEL OF

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,974
NON-TRANSPARENCY WE ARE SEEING

44
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:27,674
NOW THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE

45
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:29,043
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:32,179
DONE.

48
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:34,948
THE ADMINISTRATION TOLD A COUPLE

49
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:35,382
BANKS DO THIS.

50
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:37,217
THE PRES. AND THE WHITE HOUSE

51
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:41,588
SAYING DO THIS, THESE BANKS WERE

52
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:42,322
SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THIS SHOULD

53
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:42,656
BE DONE.

54
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,027
EVEN WITH THE WHITE HOUSE GIVING

55
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:47,528
THEM THE APPROVAL.

56
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:52,633
>> AND OF PATRIOTISM IN THIS

00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,801
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

59
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,202
THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

60
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:58,806
RIGHT AND WRONG, THEY UNDERSTAND

61
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:09,483
PRES. RONNIE --ROUHANI THEY HATE

00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:11,185
SATAN.

65
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:16,223
I SERVE A SPECIAL TASK FORCE

66
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:16,924
TRACKING TERRORIST TRAVEL ON

67
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:19,393
HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND

68
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:20,094
WE UNCOVERED SO MUCH OF WHAT

69
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:25,699
IRAN IS DOING SUPPORTING HAMAS

70
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:26,300
AND HEZBOLLAH, BRINGING

71
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,034
TERRORISTS INTO THE MIDDLE EAST

72
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:31,638
IN THE UNITED STATES AND YET

73
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:32,306
THIS MONEY THAT SUPPOSEDLY

74
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,208
SANCTION THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT

75
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,743
WAS HELPING GET INTO THE HANDS

76
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:42,416
OF URANIAN'S WHICH IS IN THE

77
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:42,950
HANDS OF TERRORISTS.

78
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,684
>> YOU WANT TO ASK WHY THIS IS

79
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:44,384
STILL SO CONTROVERSIAL YEARS

80
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:49,623
LATER BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE

81
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:50,357
GET MORE INFORMATION AND LEARN

82
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:51,024
MORE YOU GET YOUR ANSWER TO

83
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:51,325
THAT.

84
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:53,961
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THIS

85
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:54,461
HANDLED ALL ALONG?

86
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:57,865
>> THIS ENTIRE DEAL SHOULD HAVE

87
00:02:57,865 --> 00:02:58,298
DONE CONGRESS.

88
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:01,401
THE REASON THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T

89
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:02,102
DO THAT IS HE KNOWS CONGRESS

90
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:05,372
WOULD NOT APPROVE A DEAL LIKE

91
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:06,106
THIS THAT EMPOWERS THE GREATEST

92
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:06,707
ENEMIES, THE ENEMY THAT

93
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:13,780
THREATENED TO DESTROY THE UNITED

94
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,082
STATES, AND THE DEAL WAS SO

95
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:20,187
LOPSIDED IN THEIR FAVOR.

96
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:20,921
PEOPLE WENT AS FAR AS SECRETLY

97
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,690
PROVIDING $1.7 BILLION IN

98
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,628
AMERICAN CASH.

99
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:30,264
THIS MONEY WENT STRAIGHT INTO

100
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:30,864
INCREASING MILITARY AND

101
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:33,233
SUPPORTING TERRORISTS.

102
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:37,738
THIS SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A

103
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:38,405
TREATY THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

104
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:41,041
AND THAT IS NOT WHY THE

105
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:47,381
PRESIDENT WENT THE ROUTE.

106
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,115
>> DEMOCRATS SAY THIS IS THEIR

107
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:48,782
WAY OF PREVENTING IRAN FROM

108
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:49,416
GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

109
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,718
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

110
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:54,354
CONSERVATIVES DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT

111
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:54,721
THIS DEAL.

112
00:03:54,721 --> 00:04:03,964
WAS DUMPED INTO THE COUNTRY, AND

113
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:04,665
MORE IRANS IN THE WORLD, TALK

114
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,033
ABOUT A BAD DECISION FOR THE

115
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:16,843
FUTURE, MAYBE IN THE SHORT-TERM,

116
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:17,310
CREATED A MESS.

117
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,051
>> THE SANCTIONS WE AGREED TO.

118
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:27,654
THE MONEY THEY RECEIVED,

00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:28,255
ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES,

120
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:31,491
STRENGTHENING THE MILITARY, A

121
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:32,192
ROGUE REGIME HATES THE UNITED

122
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:35,495
STATES, HATE EVERYTHING WE STAND

123
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:42,502
FOR AND THEY WILL VIOLATE

124
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:43,370
DEVELOP WEAPONS AND AS PART OF

125
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,071
THE AGREEMENT THEY BANNED US

126
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:49,176
ACCESS TO THEIR MILITARY

127
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:49,810
INSTALLATIONS, TO DEVELOP

128
00:04:49,810 --> 00:05:00,254
