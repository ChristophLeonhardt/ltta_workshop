1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,780
Public housing is often considered low in quality and high in crime.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,360
But it’s a totally different story in Singapore.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,960
Government-built apartments in Singapore are clean, safe, and well-maintained.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,300
And about 80% of Singaporean households live in them.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,940
Singapore is also one of the few countries in the world

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,760
to achieve almost full homeownership status.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,380
Over 90% of the city’s households own their own homes.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,040
But it wasn't always this way.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,600
Here's how Singapore fixed its housing problem.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,000
In 1959, when Singapore obtained self-governance from the British,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,700
the city was having a severe housing crisis, struggling to accommodate its growing population.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,960
In 1960, Singapore’s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,140
and his government set up the Housing and Development Board, or HDB,

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,800
a public housing agency with a mission to build rental units for the poor.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,980
At the time, many immigrants including those from Malaysia were living in unhygienic slums.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,300
Amid increasing racial tension between Chinese and Malays,

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,560
the HDB had a hard time convincing them to leave their informal settlements for new high-rises.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Then came the still unexplained fire

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,000
which broke out in the squatter settlement of Bukit Ho Swee on May 25, 1961.

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,620
An area of 400,000 square meters was razed.

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,100
Four people were killed and around 16,000 left homeless.

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,240
The government successfully rehoused all of the fire victims within a year

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,980
and built new housing on the site of the disaster in the next five years.

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,300
Its speedy reaction won over the people and paved the way for future public housing projects.

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,540
Singapore must be one of the few places in the world

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,380
where a statutory board satisfactorily completed

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,240
everything it set out to do in its first five-year plan.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,940
By 1965, the HDB managed to build over 51,000 apartments,

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,040
rehousing 400,000 people, a quarter of the then population,

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
solving the housing shortage.

31
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,920
Apart from renting out apartments, HDB also started to sell them in 1964.

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,580
Singaporeans are required to save part of their salaries

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,919
in a state-managed plan called Central Provident Fund.

34
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,600
At first the fund only provided for retirement.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,160
Then, in 1968, the government allowed the use of the fund for housing expenses,

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,720
helping more people become homeowners.

37
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,060
Unlike many other countries, Singapore’s public housing is not only for the poor,

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,060
instead, it caters to the masses.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,480
Citizens within certain income ceilings can buy various types of property,

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,740
from basic two-room apartments to up-market units in condominiums with a swimming pool and a gym.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,720
Their prices are usually 20 to 30 percent cheaper than those in the private market.

42
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,360
But you’ve got to apply and order the apartment first,

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,340
then wait several years for it to be built.

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,240
Also, you can’t sell it until you finish the five-year minimum occupation period.

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,580
Today HDB has planned, designed and built over 1 million apartments spreading over the city-state.

46
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,320
The percentage of people living in public housing

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,280
has grown from 9% in 1960 to 82% in 2016,

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,940
and the homeownership rate has also increased rapidly with the rise of Singapore’s economy.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,980
Singapore’s public housing is considered as one of the world’s best,

50
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,340
but some see it as a way of social control.

51
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,640
For instant, quotas ensure a mix of Chinese, Indians and Malays in each HDB block,

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,760
aiming to carefully integrate ethnic groups and prevent the formation of a volatile racial enclave.

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,680
But still, a mighty agency with effective policies and strong political will

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:00:00,000
has fixed Singapore’s housing crisis and improved the living conditions of millions.
