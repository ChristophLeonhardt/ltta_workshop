THE FBI AND THE NAVY.
THEY ARE INVESTIGATING.
ABBY, DOWN TO YOU.
PETE THAT WAS QUITE A STAIR
WALK.
WELL DONE.
PETE: THANK YOU.
ABBY: LAWMAKERS IN
CALIFORNIA WANT TO GIVE TAX
BREAKS TO ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS.
GRIFF: MOVE WOULD COST
TAXPAYERS $70 MILLION.
JOHN COX CANDIDATE FOR
GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA.
HE JOINS US NOW.
HE HAS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
ENDORSEMENT.
MR. COX, GOOD MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING, GRIFF.
GOOD MORNING, ABBY.
IT'S EARLY OUT HERE.
BUT I'M UP AT&T AND AT
BUT I'M UP ANDT AND AT
BUT I'M UP AND AAND AT
BUT I'M UP AND ATND AT
BUT I'M UP AND AT E AT
BUT I'M UP AND AT ELMT
BUT I'M UP AND AT ELM.
GRIFF: BECAUSE OF SANCTUARY
CITIES AND HECK FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS THE DEMOCRATS IN
YOUR STATE OUT THERE NOW
WANT TO GIVE TAX BREAKS TO
THEM WHAT IS GOING ON.
>> TAX BREAKS IS MISNOMER.
REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT AKA
WELFARE PAYMENT, BASICALLY.
THIS IS A STATE THAT JUST
ENACTED A GAS TAX THAT IS
DRIVING THE WORKING PEOPLE
OF THIS STATE INTO POVERTY
I'M GOING TO REPEAL THAT
THIS IS JUST A GOVERNMENT
THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL AND
DOESN'T RESPOND TO THE
PEOPLE.
NOW, GAVIN NEWSOM IS THE GUY
I'M RUNNING AGAINST.
HE WANTS TO DOUBLE THE
INCOME TAX ON WORKING
CALIFORNIANS.
HE WANTS TO INCREASE
PROPERTY TAXES AND HE WANTS
TO KEEP THIS GAS TAX THEN
THEY ARE PROPOSING TO GIVE
WELFARE PAYMENTS TO ILLEGAL
ALIENS.
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU THEY
ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT
GIVING FREE MEDICAID TO
ILLEGALS.
THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO
THIS BUDGET BUT REST
ASSURED, UNDER GAVIN NEWSOM
THAT WILL BE DONE PEOPLE DO
NOT WANT THAT.
THEY ARE SICK OF HIGH TAX
CALIFORNIA.
I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO
MAKE A CHANGE IN NOVEMBER
AND THEY ARE GOING TO ELECT
ME.
ABBY: WOW.
SO WE REACHED OUT TO
GOVERNOR BROWN HIS OFFICE
ABOUT THIS STATEMENT FOR TAX
DECREASE FOR ILLEGALS.
WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK.
WE ARE WAITING FOR THEIR
RESPONSE.
AS GRIFF MENTIONED, YOU HAVE
THE ENDORSEMENT FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
GAVIN NEWSOM IS RUNNING
WITH.
THIS HE TWEETED OUT TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING
PLEASE COME OUT TO THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA.
CAMPAIGN FOR JOHN COX AS
MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.
HE FEELS THAT'S ONLY GOING
TO HELP HIM.
WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE?
>> YOU KNOW, GAVIN NEWSOM IS
EXHIBIT A IN CRAVEN
POLITICIANS.
AND, OF COURSE, HE WANTS
THIS ALL TO BE ABOUT
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS I POINTED
OUT MANY TIMES, PRESIDENT
TRUMP DIDN'T CREATE ROADS
THAT ARE SOME OF THE WORST
IN THE NATION AND MORE
EXPENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER
STATE.
HE DIDN'T -- PRESIDENT TRUMP
DIDN'T CREATE A SCHOOL
SYSTEM THAT RANKS 45TH IN
THE NATION?
STATE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
WATER BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN
TEARING DOWN RESERVOIRS
INSTEAD OF BUILDING THEM.
THIS STATE HAS THE WORST TAX
ENVIRONMENT, THE WORST
BUSINESS CLIMATE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T
CREATE THE SANCTUARY STATE
IN THIS STATE.
GAVIN NEWSOM DID THAT.
ABBY: DO YOU THINK IT WOULD
HELP OR HURT TO YOU HAVE THE
PRESIDENT ON THE GROUND
THERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH
YOU.
>> I WOULD LOVE THE
PRESIDENT TO BE OUT HERE.
BECAUSE HE IS A BUSINESSMAN.
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.
I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THE
MISMANAGEMENT OF THIS STATE.
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER
THE MANAGEMENT HERE, AND
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A
LIVABLE STATE.
A STATE THAT IS NOT THE
LAUGHING STOCK OF THE
COUNTRY BUT IS ACTUALLY THE
SHINING CITY ON A HILL THAT
PRESIDENT REAGAN, WHO WAS
THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA
BEFORE THAT, HE TALKED ABOUT
THAT.
GRIFF: THAT'S AN INTERESTING
POINT, JOHN.
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
RATINGS NOW ARE SIMILAR TO
WHAT RONALD REAGAN'S WAS AT
HIS SAME TIME IN HIS
PRESIDENCY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
GRIFF: LET ME ASK YOU THIS
THOUGH, AS GOES CALIFORNIA
GOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
IT SEEMS FOR THE DEMOCRATS
HANDBOOK ON BEING THE
HEADQUARTERS OF THE
RESISTANCE.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WHY WILL
SEE A NOVEMBER SOMETHING
HAPPENING THAT DOESN'T
AMOUNT TO THAT BLUE WAVE AND
THAT THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY, DEMOCRATS THAT IS,
WILL MAKE THAT MISTAKE.
>> I'M GOING TO NATIONALIZE
THIS RACE.
THIS STATE AND THIS RACE
HERE IS GOING TO BE THE
RESISTANCE TO THE
RESISTANCE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT
MAKING THE STATEMENT THAT
WE'RE SICK OF CAREER
POLITICIANS LIKE GAVIN
NEWSOM.
WE'RE SICK OF THE SWAMP.
I'M GOING TO CLEAN OUT THE
BARN IN SACRAMENTO AND WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT
THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET
THIS STATE MANAGED PROPERLY
WITHOUT THE CORRUPTION OF
THESE SPECIAL INTEREST AND
THESE CAREER POLITICIANS.
I'M ALL FOR THE PRESIDENT
COMING OUT HERE.
ABBY: ALL RIGHT, JOHN COX,
RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF
CALIFORNIA.
A RACE WE WILL ALL BE
WATCHING CLOSELY.
IT IS EARLY.
THANK YOU FOR WAKING UP FOR
