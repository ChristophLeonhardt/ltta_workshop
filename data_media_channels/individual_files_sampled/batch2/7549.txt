fascinating new story out of New Yorker Jane Mayer one of the best journalists we have in the country breaking a story about a second steal memo now if you don't remember steals the guy who wrote the first dossier about Trump and what he might have done with the Russians that had one cessation 'el story about golden showers in a hotel room apparently in this new jane mayer piece we find out that one of the big guys who wrote it didn't even want to include that because true or not true his word he would over sensationalize that when the more pedestrian parts of the member were far more important about Trump aids and Trump's campaigns connections to the Russians now if you read that memo at least four parts of it have already been proven to be correct and an hour now beyond dispute including very important things like Carter page of Trump campaign official meeting with Russians in Moscow now it turns out there was a second memo written and that's already huge news right there and wait till you get a load of what's in it turns out the Russians if you believe these allegations helped to pick our Secretary of State now there's very good reasons to believe it but let me give you the full context Mayer explains one subject that Steele is believed to have discussed with Muller's investigators is a memo that he wrote in late November 2016 after his contract with fusion had ended that's the people that he wrote their original dossier for this memo which did not service publicly with the others is shorter than the rest and is based on one source described as quote a senior Russian official okay now if you're a robber Muller you want to find out who that senior Russian official is and perhaps more importantly for our purposes here in the US who they were talking to on the other side so we'll get to that in a second the official said that he was merely relaying talk circulating in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs but what he'd heard was astonishing people were saying that the Kremlin had intervened to block Trump's initial choice of Secretary of State Mitt Romney all of that is true that is indeed astonishing now it might not be astonishing to you guys if you watch The Young Turks as I told you from the get-go that Rex was clearly chosen because the Russians wanted him to lift the sanctions I said that from the day that not MIDI was announced probably before he was announced when he was being considered said why in the world would you have the former CEO of Exxon Mobil be the Secretary of State that makes no sense except for the half a trillion dollar deal that Russia had with ExxonMobil and that's what the sanctions blocked so we'll get back to rice Thorson in a second but let's continue about Romney the memo said that the Kremlin through unspecified channels had asked Trump to appoint someone who would be prepared to lift Ukraine related sanctions and who would cooperate on secure issue security issues of interest to Russia such as the conflict in Syria now if Trump actually did this look I don't care about the word treason and you know whether that crime can be pursued or not but obviously he would be gone gone gone gone gone gone to let another country any country pick our sectors state so that the sanctions could be lifted on that country do I have to bother explaining why that would be horrific and not acceptable for the President of the United States to do so okay if Mullah proves this game over completely over President Trump is obviously out I imagine he would resign before he was impeached but prison would also be something that would be seriously considered and I don't know if it would go to that just because of how deeply embarrassed the whole country would be given that our president is you know working apparently at the behest of another country now you could say hey it hasn't been proven yet and hasn't been proven in a court of law but this guy has been right over and over in the beginning when I saw the Steele memo I was very skeptical about the whole thing you could watch old clips of me being skeptical about it but after it was proven right four different times and now we're on to this and it matches the logic of what we have seen in public and he's got a source well that's a lot of ands we'll see you know what Muller comes about which is the most important part but let's keep going here in any case on December 13 2016 mayor reports Trump gave Rex Tillerson the CEO of ExxonMobil the job the choice is a surprise to most and a happy one in Moscow because to OSH's business ties with a Kremlin we're long-standing and warm I detailed for you guys those ties about a year ago when tiller was first picked he's very good friends with both Putin he's gotten an award from the Russian government reckless in our Secretary of State has why because they were making business deals regarding oil so as a businessman I guess that makes sense as our Secretary of State less sense anyway he also is very good ties with the major oil companies in in Russia and one of the guys who had the sanctions put on in one of the Russian oligarchs said that till he was looking forward to come back to America so he could ride motorcycles with Rex Tillerson so in 2011 by the way he also Tillerson did brokered a historic partnership between Exxon Mobil and roastin F that's the one that I've been telling you about for a year now that's the one that was blocked by the sanctions and both Exxon Mobil and Russia was heavily motivated to left and then have that you'll go through now here's another interesting part of the mayor piece in The New Yorker the White House declined to comment about any community issues that Trump team may have had with Russia on the subject really you couldn't get a denial on that issue so a reporter calls the White House and says we have a memo saying that you let another country pick our Secretary of State and there you go well we declined to comment on that particular issue what know if you didn't do it a massive denial is an order are you insane that we let some other country pick our secretary said of course we didn't would be the correct response to that no comment declined to comment about any communications that the Trump team may have had with Russia on the subject I know that the Muellers on there allas so they're now worried about lying to the authorities etc but that appears to be very telling all right that's interesting now one more for mayor after election Congress impose additional sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its interference but Trump and Tillerson have resisted enacting them hmm so there's a one thing about how it looks like based on this information from a source within the Russian government they say no not Mitt Romney Mitt Romney was very harsh on Russia when he ran against Obama in 2012 so they don't want him under any circumstance but yes Rex Tillerson he's a good friend of ours and we have a I say half a trillion dollar deal but the revenue from that deal would actually be s it was estimated to be nine trillion dollars not billion trillion that's a lot of reasons to collaborate with someone instead we'll take Rex Tillerson they don't deny it and and since then but do you have evidence that Tillerson has helped the Russians and Trump has helped the Russians well both of them say we will not put the sanctions in place even though Trump signed into law which is not going to do it we're not gonna do it now we didn't do it before we're not gonna do it later which is not going to do it in fact a separate story unrelated this also broke today the State Department has spent zero dollars of the 120 million dollars allocated by Congress to combat foreign efforts to influence US elections whose the State Department run by oh right Rex Tillerson well what a happy coincidence again for Russia that the Secretary of State that they might have picked themselves has decided to be he's not going to combat Russian interference in our elections a despite the massive budget Huff Post reports Secretary of State Rex Olson has done little to thwart a sweeping influence campaign by the Russian government and an office tasks with countering such efforts has no employees that even speak Russian they're not even pretending it's comical Tillison himself has continued to doubt the ability of his department to combat Russia and just last month said that if Moscow wanted a medal it was quote going to find ways to do that well that's really encouraging the Secretary of State goon ah what do you want me to know about it if they're gonna meddle they get a medal what we gave you 120 million dollars to do something about it he's not going to though which begs the question who does he work for so that also goes to the president now speaking of which let's go to Dan Coates he's he works for the president he's appointed by Donald Trump huge right winger massive conservative now Director of National Intelligence so what does he have to say about whether there's Russian interference well under Trump you know imagine he'd say on its polluter that's a hoax or nope nope nope here is Trump's own Director of National Intelligence saying quote we expect Russia to continue using propaganda social media false flag personas sympathetic spokespeople and other means to influence to try to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States there should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 US midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations hey Russia you should have also told Trump who to pick as his Director of National Intelligence there's Dan Coates and although he's deeply conservative there and picked by Donald Trump is being principled and saying yes of course they interfered and they're looking to do it again I don't know if this is basically beseeching Tillerson and other parts of the government for God's sake will you do something already and by do something we don't mean warrants certainly I don't I don't mean further hostilities I mean can you take precautions to make sure that the voting booths are protected can you do standard things to make sure that our elections have integrity and that we can count on them and that it is in fact our democracy but if a foreign government is picking our cabinet officials that is not what I would call a healthy democracy that is what I would call deeply illegal and something that needs to be addressed immediately so we'll all find out soon enough I hope when Muller concludes his investigation and by the way if he looks into all this and decides no that that memo was wrong he'll let us know and if he thinks it's right he better have a lot of evidence if he's going to try to you know go after the President of the United States and he's a very careful prosecutor so if he does in fact say this happened my guess is that he will have overwhelming evidence and by the way just because the case hasn't happened there is no indictment of Trump yet doesn't mean that evidence does not exist there is a lot of evidence already in public they will not enforce the sanctions they will not try to come back Russia's meddling in our elections they refuse to spend the money they refuse to take any actions and Tillison we know for a fact was a very good ally of the Russian government and one of those sanctions lifted he was on the record on that and and he was picked when the CEO of an oil company makes no sense at all as Secretary of State with no foreign policy experience it's right in front of your eyes if you care to see it if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now tea why tea network.com slash joined get the whole young turks Oh every day
