1
00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:01,172
MANAGER COREY LEWANDOWSKI SAID

2
00:00:01,173 --> 00:00:02,239
HE NEVER HEARD THAT WORD AND

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,908
THERE WAS NEVER A CONVERSATION

4
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:06,944
>> Ed: TRACE GALLAGHER

5
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,381
THE FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR THE

6
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:11,582
2017 TRUMP CAMPAIGN, CURRENT

00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,784
SENIOR ADVISOR TO A 2020

8
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:15,152
CAMPAIGN, KATRINA PIERSON,

9
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:20,958
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT SO WE

10
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,494
DON'T HAVE YOU AT THEIR NIGHT IN

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,963
US LAST NIGHT BECAUSE I GOT AN

12
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:28,265
EMAIL THAT YOU TOLD TREVOR NOAH

13
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:29,266
AT "THE DAILY SHOW" SHE HEARD ME

14
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:31,268
TELL YOU THAT YOU KNEW NOTHING

15
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,671
ABOUT CONFERENCE CALL, TALKING

16
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:34,672
ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT USED

17
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:36,674
FOR N-WORD, YOU SAID THIS WAS A

18
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:37,508
MOVIE SCRIPT.

19
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,477
SO SHE SHE SAYS, SHE RELEASED AT

20
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:40,544
LEAST ONE OF THESE AUDIOTAPES TO

21
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:46,150
NOT TRUE AS WELL.

22
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:47,985
THERE ARE TWO OF TWO THINGS THAT

23
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:48,886
OCCURRED LAST NIGHT IN OUR

24
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:50,121
DISCUSSION.

25
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:51,722
YOU HAVE READ FOR ME A BOOK

26
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:53,290
EXCERPT THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN

27
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,358
BECAUSE THE BOOK CANNOT COME

28
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,861
OUT YET, AND YOU REFERENCED MEAN

29
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:01,465
THAT IS FALSE.

30
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,478
>> SHE HAS BEEN ON THIS CAMPAIGN

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,713
TRAIL -- ON HER LITTLE BOOK

32
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:17,314
TRAIL -- WHEN HER INTERVIEW WITH

33
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:18,616
CHUCK TODD AND SAVANNAH GUTHRIE,

34
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:18,649
CHUCK TODD AND SAVANNAH GUTHRIES

35
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:18,883
CHUCK TODD AND SAVANNAH GUTHRIEE

36
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:25,923
ADDRESSING IN ALL OF MY

37
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:26,323
INTERVIEWS.

38
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:29,493
LET'S PLAY THE CLIP FROM LAST

39
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:30,527
NIGHT.

40
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:32,696
I WAS ASKING YOU ABOUT THE

41
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:33,797
PRESIDENT TALKING TO LONGTIME

42
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:35,599
AIDE LYNNE PATTON ABOUT WHETHER

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,401
OR NOT HE HAD USED THIS BE 23.

44
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:38,702
LET'S PLAY THAT AND WE'LL GET TO

45
00:01:38,703 --> 00:01:39,870
THE FACTS.

46
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,571
SPEAK A LONG TIME TRUMP AIDE

47
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:42,306
REPORTED SHE ASKED TRUMP ABOUT

48
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:43,107
IT ON THE PLANE SPECIFICALLY,

49
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,575
WHETHER IT WAS POSSIBLE SO TREY

50
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,243
TATE MIGHT EXIST, AND HE SAID

51
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:46,510
NO.

52
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:50,647
THEN SHE, KATRINA, ASKED HIM

53
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:52,282
WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO.

54
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:53,851
KATRINA CURSED AND SAID, HE SAID

55
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:54,318
IT.

56
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,285
DID THAT HAPPEN?

57
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:56,453
>> [LAUGHS]

58
00:01:56,454 --> 00:01:56,787
NO, ED.

59
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:57,488
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

60
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,923
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS WRITING A

61
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:00,457
SCRIPT FOR A MOVIE.

62
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,726
I HAVE ALREADY BEEN OUT THERE

63
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,128
TALKING ABOUT THIS, THAT IS

64
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,129
ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.

65
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:12,669
I SAID "SHE" LAST NIGHT, I SAID,

66
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,437
"SHE," KATRINA PIERSON, WITH THE

67
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:17,674
BOOK SAYS, "YOU, WHEN PEARSON."

68
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:18,509
THAT I APOLOGIZE.

69
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,244
THAT IS AN HONEST MISTAKE.

70
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:21,512
THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT

71
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:22,579
THAT YOU ARE NOW CLAIMING THEY

72
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,647
ARE TRIGGERED EVERY PHONE CALLS,

73
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:25,449
TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WITH JASON

74
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,394
LINE WITH JASON MILLER, ONE WITO

75
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:37,427
LINE WITH JASON MILLER, ONE WITT

76
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:37,661
LINE WITH JASON MILLER, ONE WITA

77
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:39,897
SECOND.

78
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,933
THE ONE WITHOUT JASON MILLER ON

79
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:44,234
CBS, OMAROSA SAYS COME ACCORDING

80
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,202
TO A TRANSCRIPT YOU PROVIDED MAY

81
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:47,104
COME A POINT THEY ARE NOT

82
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:48,772
AIRED YET, OMAROSA SAYS, "YEAH,

83
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:50,707
IT'S OUT THERE," MEANING THIS

84
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,277
WEEK 23 TAPE, IT IS JUST -- AND

85
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:55,712
KATRINA PIERSON CUTS IN, "YEAH,

86
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:56,880
HE SAID IT.

87
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:57,915
[BLEEP], OKAY."

88
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,183
THAT IS A ROUGHLY WHAT SHE SAID

89
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:01,285
IN THE BOOK, THAT YOU CURSED HIM

90
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:03,654
AS I ASK YOU LAST NIGHT, AND YOU

91
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:05,289
SAID, HE SAID IT.

92
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,256
HE USED FOR N-WORD.

93
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:07,190
YOU DENY THAT TO ME.

94
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:08,492
>> ABSOLUTELY.

95
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:09,493
YOU KNOW WHY?

96
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,295
I'M REFUTING A CLAIM THAT

97
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,362
OMAROSA MADE AND I'LL SAY IT

98
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:14,431
AGAIN ON CHUCK TODD AND SAVANNAH

99
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:14,765
GUTHRIE.

100
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,199
>> Ed: LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT

101
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,600
CHUCK TODD.

102
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:18,502
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STATE.

103
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:19,302
PARDON ME.

104
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:21,972
I'M NOT GOING TO -- PARDON ME!

105
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:25,442
NO, NO, NO -- THE TAPE SAYS THAT

106
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:26,877
YOU SAID THAT HE SAID IT.

107
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,478
YOU TOLD ME YOU NEVER SAID THAT!

108
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,913
SPEAK ABOUT IS NOT.

109
00:03:32,283 --> 00:03:34,651
>> THIS IS THE QUESTION -- THIS

110
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:36,119
IS REGARDS TO A SPECIFIC

111
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,320
DISCUSSION -- CHECK THE TAPE OF

112
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:39,289
WHAT HE SAID ON CHUCK TODD AND

113
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:39,923
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE!

114
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:42,159
SHE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT I

115
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,127
SAID AND CONFIRMED THAT

116
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,701
THAT IS WHAT I'M REFUTING!

117
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:53,737
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY, ED, WHAT

118
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:54,904
HAPPENED TODAY, OMAROSA

119
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:58,141
SUBMITTED TWO DIFFERENT TAPES TO

120
00:03:58,142 --> 00:03:58,441
CBS --

121
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:01,578
>> WE HAVE TO!

122
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,680
>> Ed: NO, NO, PARDON ME.

123
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:04,481
IT'S OUR SHOW.

124
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:05,749
HANG ON ONE SECOND.

125
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,650
I WILL ADMIT THEIR STRUGGLE

126
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:06,950
TAPES.

127
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,721
LEAVE LEAD THIS DISCUSSION.

128
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:13,690
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

129
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,691
TODAY, YOU CLARIFIED TODAY AND

130
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:16,760
SAID, I JUST SAID, YES, HE USED

131
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:18,461
THE N-WORD BECAUSE THEY WANTED

132
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:19,796
TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION ALONG.

133
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:20,930
>> THAT WAS A DIFFERENT

134
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,330
DISCUSSION.

135
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:22,499
TO BE WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE

136
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,335
IF THAT IS THE TRUTH, WHY DIDN'T

137
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:26,803
YOU TELL ME, ED, I DON'T KNOW

138
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,242
YES, HE USED THE N-WORD TO MOVE

139
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,310
THE CONVERSATION ALONG.

140
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,778
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT LAST NIGHT.

141
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,247
>> THE QUESTION I WAS ASKED

142
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:38,648
ABOUT THIS CONFERENCE CALL WITH

143
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,450
JASON MILLER, THE ANSWER IS, NO.

144
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:42,285
THAT WAS NOT SAID BY THE

145
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:45,688
THE FIRST CALL THAT YOU WERE

146
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:46,923
TALKING ABOUT WHERE SHE IS

147
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:49,259
CLAIMING THAT I SAID THAT WAS IN

148
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,264
PATTON ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF

149
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:54,697
THIS TAPE.

150
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:56,299
LET ME EXPLAIN SOME THING TO!

151
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,669
OMAROSA HAS BEEN USING THIS TAPE

152
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,241
DOG WITH A BONE IN THIS TAPE --

153
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:08,912
>> Ed: YOU KEEP USING "DOG" --

154
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:11,481
LET'S GO TO THE FACTS ARE NOT

155
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:11,814
ATTACKS.

156
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:12,649
>> ABSOLUTELY PRIDES ME WHEN YOU

157
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,883
KEEP TALKING ABOUT A SIMILAR.

158
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:14,384
THE SECOND CALL.

159
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:17,954
>> Ed: LET TALK ABOUT THAT

160
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,891
ON THAT CALL, YOU SEE IN YOUR

161
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:23,259
STATEMENT TODAY THAT BASICALLY,

162
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,694
WE WERE JUST SIFTING THROUGH

163
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,130
HE WAS A CAMPAIGN AIDE.

164
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:28,698
IN FACT, WE HAVE A TRANSCRIPT

165
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,200
THAT YOU PROVIDED, OKAY, AND

166
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:32,135
HERE IS WHAT IS ON THE TAPE.

167
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:33,937
JASON MILLER SAYS, "IT'S KIND OF

168
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:35,305
TOUGH TO GO OUT AND DROP

169
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:35,972
SOMETHING ABOUT WHETHER THE

170
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:36,739
PRESIDENT USES THE N-WORD WHEN

171
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,575
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE CONTEXT

172
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:39,142
IS.

173
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:41,744
I HATE TO START EMAILING THINGS

174
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:43,613
AROUND WHEN WE ARE JUST -- THAT

175
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:44,480
IS SIFTING THROUGH RUMORS.

176
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:51,254
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO AROUND

177
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:52,755
MAKING THESE ACCUSATIONS AND

178
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:54,857
COMING UP WITH THINGS --

179
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,459
IT'S VERY TRUE.

180
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,428
>> Ed: YOU SAY -- HANG ON.

181
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,128
YOU JUST MISQUOTED YOURSELF.

182
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,665
YOU SAID, I SAID, THAT IS TRUE.

183
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,400
NO, YOU SAID IT'S TRUE.

184
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,269
>> THE AUDIO SAID, IT'S TRUE.

185
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,270
IT'S TRUE, YOU DON'T WANT TO

186
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:08,471
MAKE THOSE KINDS OF CLAIMS.

187
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:10,540
IF YOU BACK UP, LYNNE PATTON

188
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,507
SAYS, THAT'S TRUE, BECAUSE WE

189
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:13,843
ARE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT,

190
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:14,510
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE.

191
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,446
WE ARE SAYING, IN THIS

192
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:17,647
TRANSCRIPT, THAT THERE IS

193
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:19,449
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WE CAN FIND,

194
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,117
THEY ARE JUST RUMORS AND

195
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:22,318
INNUENDO ABOUT THIS TAPE AND IT

196
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,820
IS TRUE THAT WE CANNOT MOVE

197
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:24,554
FORWARD WITH THIS WITHOUT IT

198
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:26,322
RATES ME WHEN YOU JUST USE THE

199
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:27,890
TERM "DOG."

200
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,394
I WAS TALKING TO YOU BEFORE THE

201
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:37,266
SHOW, YOU HAVE A SON, YOU LOVE

202
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:37,700
HIM VERY MUCH.

203
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,434
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT OUT OF

204
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:38,734
THIS.

205
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,369
DO YOU RAISE YOUR SON TO CALL A

206
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:46,642
>> THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY SON.

207
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:48,844
>> Ed: WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

208
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,680
FOR YOU, OR FOR ME -- WE WILL

209
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,650
>> THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE WITH

210
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:56,686
DONALD TRUMP IN OMAROSA.

211
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:57,920
>> Ed: WE'LL LEAVE YOUR SON

212
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:58,688
OUT OF IT AND THE PRESIDENT OUT

213
00:06:58,689 --> 00:06:59,655
OF IT.

214
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:00,389
WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME

215
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,491
TO CALL THE WOMAN A DOG?

216
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:02,958
YES OR NO?

217
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,560
>> IT DEPENDS ON WHAT SHE DID TO

218
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:04,827
YOU.

219
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:06,696
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DID.

220
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:08,331
OMAROSA BIT THE HAND THAT FED

221
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:08,597
HER.

222
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:10,499
TO ME, THAT IS WHAT A DOG IS.

223
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,535
THE PRESIDENT HAS REFERENCE TO

224
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:15,838
SEVERAL MEN AS DOGS, LIKE

225
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,939
MITT ROMNEY, HE HAS OTHERS TO A

226
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:22,278
>> Ed: AS A WOMAN, DO YOU

227
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,179
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR ANY

228
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,314
MAN TO CALL THE WOMAN A DOG?

229
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:25,681
REALLY?

230
00:07:25,682 --> 00:00:00,000
>> AS A WOMAN, AS A STRONG BLACK
