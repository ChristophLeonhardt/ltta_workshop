00:00:09,248 --> 00:00:10,649
FOR POLICY IDEAS AND A GOOD

CANDIDATE TO RUN AGAINST

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,552
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020.

5
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:15,520
SOME WHO ARE CONSIDERING A RUN

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,155
WERE AT A FORUM YESTERDAY.

7
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:19,858
TESTING OUT MESSAGES.

8
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:20,259
WATCH.

9
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:23,462
>> MY NEIGHBORS, MY RESIDENTS

10
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:24,796
ARE INCREDIBLE FOLK WHO WORK

11
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:25,330
HARD AT ANYTHING.

12
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,199
IN FACT, I WOULD ARGUE THEY

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,600
ARE WORKING HARDER THAN THEIR

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,668
PARENTS DID BUT THEY ARE

15
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:30,836
MAKING LESS MONEY.

16
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:32,304
>> I THINK THIS ELECTION CALLS

17
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:32,804
FOR BOLD IDEAS.

18
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,172
I THINK THE WOMEN HAVE TO BE

19
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:35,307
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE THINGS

20
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:36,541
THEY WANT.

21
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,111

IMMIGRATION REFORM, GUN

REFORM.

26
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,852
INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY.

27
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:48,053
EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY.

28
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:49,821
REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

29
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:51,423
BREAK UP THE BANKS, BRING BACK

30
00:00:51,423 --> 00:00:53,425
THE UNIONS.

31
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:54,793
>> Dana: COLIN REED IS A

SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF

DESIGNERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND A

34
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:00,499
COLUMNIST.

35
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:02,467
RICHARD FOWLER IS A FOX NEWS

36
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:03,735
CONTRIBUTOR AND BOTH GOOD

37
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:04,468
FRIENDS.

38
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:06,004
ELIZABETH WARREN IS GIVING US

39
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:07,005
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

40
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:08,407
YOU KNOW HER WELL GIVEN THAT

41
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:09,408
YOU KNOW MASSACHUSETTS AND

42
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:10,309
BOSTON CERTAINLY.

43
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:13,512
LET ME READ TO YOU SOMETHING

44
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,381
THAT DANA MILLBANK WROTE.

45
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,416
I ALWAYS READ HIM.

46
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,483
HE WAS AT THE EVENT YESTERDAY

47
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:19,985
AND HE SAID FOR NOVEMBER'S

48
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:21,253
MID-TERM ELECTIONS IT MAY BE

49
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,654
ENOUGH FOR DEMOCRATS TO SAY

50
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:24,156
THEY ARE AGAINST TRUMP.

51
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:25,691
BUT TO BEAT TRUMP, THEY WILL

52
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:26,358
NEED MORE.

53
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:27,759
TRUMP CONVINCED TENS OF

54
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,794
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THAT

55
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:29,995
THEY ARE LOSING GROUND BECAUSE

56
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:31,963
OF IMMIGRANTS, RACIAL AND

57
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:33,098
RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND

58
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:36,301
FOREIGNERS.

59
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,869
WHAT WILL DEMOCRATS ADVANCE TO

60
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:38,704
COUNTER THAT GRIM MESSAGE?

61
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,572
DID YOU HEAR IT IN WHAT

62
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:41,873
ELIZABETH WARREN WAS SAYING?

63
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:43,942
I'LL GO TO YOU, COLIN.

64
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:45,277
>> IT'S TRUE BEFORE WE GET TO

65
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:47,779
2020, WE CAN LOOK TO 2018 AS

66
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,748
INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR HOW THE

67
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:50,682
DEMOCRATS WILL RUN.

68
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,651
IN 2018 IT IS A REFERENDUM ON

69
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,051
TRUMP.

70
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:54,386
THAT IS THEIR ONLY MESSAGE.

71
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:55,654
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ECONOMIC

72
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:55,987
MESSAGE.

73
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:57,155
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WOULD ADMIT

74
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:57,456
THAT.

75
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:59,591
I DON'T KNOW IT WILL WORK IN

76
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:00,625
2018, ESPECIALLY WITH AN

77
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,860
ECONOMY GOING THE WAY IT IS

78
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,862
AND ALSO WITH THE DEMOCRATS

79
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,364
NOMINATING BERNIE SANDERS IN

80
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:06,365
PLACES LIKE NEBRASKA LAST

81
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:06,765
NIGHT.

82
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,400
>> Dana: RICHARD, I WANT TO

83
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,401
ASK YOU TWO THINGS.

84
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,669
IS THE ECONOMIC MESSAGE WHAT

85
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,704
NANCY PELOSI HAS SUGGESTED TO

86
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:16,007
ROLL BACK THE TAX PACKAGE THAT

87
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,175
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ABLE TO

88
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:18,877
ADVANCE IN DECEMBER?

89
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:21,580
SECONDLY, DO ANY OF THE PEOPLE

90
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,814
MATTER WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO

91
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:25,650
ONE OF THE FORUMS TO TEST THE

92
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,086
WATERS FOR 2020 IF BERNIE

93
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,688
SANDERS IS GOING TO RUN AGAIN?

94
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:30,522
>> TO ANSWER THE FIRST

95
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:31,957
QUESTION TO SOME EXTENT NANCY

96
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:32,624
PELOSI IS RIGHT.

97
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,126
PART OF IT IS ROLLING BACK THE

98
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:34,893
TAX PACKAGE.

99
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,862
THE OTHER PART IS THE

100
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:38,463
DEMOCRATIC PARTY BETTER DEAL.

101
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:40,332
THAT IS WHAT YOU HEARD CONOR

102
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:41,700
LAMB TALK ABOUT WHEN HE RAN

103
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,168
FOR CONGRESS THIS PAST MARCH.

104
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,137
THE IDEAL OF HOW DO WE FIX

105
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:45,537
HEALTHCARE?

106
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:47,372
NOT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

107
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,541
BUT HOW DO WE FIX HEALTHCARE

108
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,710
ON THE EMPLOYER-BASED SIDE?

109
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,111
PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEING THE

110
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,513
HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS GO UP.

111
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:55,814
BUT TO ANSWER THE SECOND

112
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:57,416
QUESTION IT'S TOO PREMATURE TO

113
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,850
THINK ABOUT 2020 ALREADY

114
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,218
SEEING THAT, REMEMBER THIS

115
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,220
TIME IN 2014 DONALD TRUMP

116
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,488
WASN'T EVEN ON THE RADAR.

117
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,790
NOW HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

118
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,690
UNITED STATES.

119
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,159
BUT DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DO A

120
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,261
COUPLE OF THINGS GOING INTO

121
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,562
THIS MID-TERM ELECTION AND THE

122
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:10,896
GENERAL.

123
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:11,863
HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE

124
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:13,064
AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT

125
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:14,366
HEALTHCARE, AND ON TOP OF THAT

126
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,967
HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE

127
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:16,601
AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE

128
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,969
ISSUES CONCERNING THEM AT

129
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,671
THEIR KITCHEN TABLES.

130
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:20,839
FIXING PUBLIC EDUCATION.

131
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:23,375
NORTH KOREA -- NORTH CAROLINA

132
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,976
IS THE NEXT STATE TO GO ON A

133
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:26,344
STATEWIDE TEACHER STRIKE THIS

134
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:26,678
WEEK.

135
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,246
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE

136
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:28,613
DONE.

137
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:29,281
>> Dana: COLIN, THE

138
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,715
DEMOCRATS PUT OUT A DOCUMENT

139
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:32,818
CALLED "A BETTER DEAL."

140
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:33,952
I ACTUALLY READ IT.

141
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,387
THERE ARE SOME GOOD POLICY IN

142
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:35,887
THERE.

143
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:37,222
ONE OF THE THINGS I SAW THAT

144
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,524
IS FRUSTRATING DEMOCRATS IS

145
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:41,827
THAT OTHER PLACES ON CABLE

146
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:44,129
NEWS WILL NOT TALK ABOUT THIS

147
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,297
DEAL BECAUSE THEY ARE OBSESSED

148
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:46,765
WITH THE RUSSIA COVERAGE.

149
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,667
DO THE DEMOCRATS, HAVE THEY

150
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,368
BOXED THEMSELVES IN BY TALKING

151
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,003
ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

152
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:53,972
SO MUCH THAT THEY CAN'T

153
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,173
ACTUALLY GET ATTENTION FOR

154
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:56,675
POLICIES THEY WANT TO PUT

155
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:57,075
FORWARD?

156
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:57,509
>> THEY HAVE.

157
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,277
THEY HAVE BANKED EVERYTHING ON

158
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:00,712
THIS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

159
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:03,982
IF IT COMES BACK AND BOB

160
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:04,816
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION SAYS

161
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,318
NOTHING WAS THERE, THEN

162
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,120
DEMOCRATS ARE IN A TERRIBLE

163
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,422
SPOT POLITICALLY BECAUSE THEY

164
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,591
HAVE PLACED SO MUCH POLITICAL

165
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:13,792
CAPITAL ON IT.

166
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,227
CONOR LAMB DID NOT TALK ABOUT

167
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:16,027
THE BETTER WAY.

168
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:18,930
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T

169
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,065
GOING TO VOTE FOR NANCY

170
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:20,464
PELOSI.

171
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:22,467
IS THE ONLY REASON HE RAN IN

172
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:23,101
PENNSYLVANIA 18.

173
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:24,436
SHE REMAINS THE BIGGEST

174
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:25,103
LIABILITY AND SHE MADE IT

175
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:25,937
CLEAR SHE IS NOT GOING

176
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:26,304
ANYWHERE.

177
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,973
SHE IS A HUGE IMPEDIMENT FOR

178
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,841
THE DEMOCRATS TO GO ANYWHERE.

179
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:33,545
>> Dana: LAST WORD, RICHARD.

180
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:36,448
>> IT'S NAIVE TO BRING CONOR

181
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:37,215
LAMB TO ONE ISSUE.

182
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:38,683
HE TALKED ABOUT THE COAL

183
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:39,718
MINERS AS WELL.

184
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:40,886
YOU ARE RIGHT THAT BECAUSE OF

185
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:42,220
THIS RUSSIA COLLUSION THING

186
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,622
AND THE FACT THAT THE

187
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:44,723
PRESIDENT KEEPS TWEETING ABOUT

188
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:46,391
IT, THE DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T BEEN

189
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,126
ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE BETTER

190
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,427
WAY CAMPAIGN WHICH TALKS ABOUT

191
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:50,529
HOW TO LOWER THE COST OF

192
