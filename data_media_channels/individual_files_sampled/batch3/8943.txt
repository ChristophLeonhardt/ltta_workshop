Laura: TIME NOW FOR OUR "DEFENDING THE FIRST" WHERE WE DEFEND THE AMENDMENT, AND FREE THOUGHT. YOU ALL KNOW BEN SHAPIRO, AND IF YOU DON'T, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? HE'S BECOME ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING FIGURES IN THE EFFORTS TO PRESERVE FREE SPEECH, ESPECIALLY ON CAMPUS. HE'S ALSO BEEN A FREQUENT TARGET OF LEFTISTS FOR TRYING TO SHUT DOWN HIS FREE SPEECH. WHAT'S THE LATEST ATTEMPT? I WAS WAITING FOR THIS. THIS IS A CAMPAIGN TO BLAME BEN SHAPIRO FOR INCITING A DEADLY TERROR ATTACK ON A CANADIAN MOSQUE LAST YEAR. WE WELCOME BACK TO THE ANGLE, BEN SHAPIRO. THE EDITOR AND CHIEF OF THE DAILY WIRE. HE LOOKS SO UNASSUMING, AND WHAT DO YOU WEIGH, LIKE 150 POUNDS? 165, COME ON. LAUGH Laura: WHAT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING. EXPLAIN HOW YOU ARE ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN INSPIRING THIS HORRIBLE ATTACK ON A MOSQUE, BECAUSE YOU MADE COMMENTS ABOUT ISLAMIC TERROR IN THE PAST AND IT WAS ALL STITCHED TOGETHER? Ben: THERE WAS THIS EVIL PIECE OF HUMAN THAT SHOT UP A MOSQUE LAST YEAR AND HE HAPPENED TO BE SOMEBODY THAT SAW SOME OF MY TWEETS ON TWITTER. HE HAD ALSO SEEN TWEETS FROM PEOPLE, FROM YOU AND A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT I GUESS MY ACCOUNT WAS THE ONE HE HAD VIEWED THE MOST. NOW I HAVE 1.4 MILLION TWITTER FOLLOWERS SO IF SOMEONE VIEWS ENOUGH OF MY TWEETS, THEY ARE INEVITABLY GOING TO BECOME A TERRORIST. WE ARE THAT I DON'T HAVE A SPACE OF ENORMOUS TERRORISM ACROSS THE COUNTRY THANKS TO MY TWITTER FOLLOWING, BUT NONE OF THIS IS REAL. PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT DID NOT SAY THIS WAS BERNIE SANDERS' FAULT.
