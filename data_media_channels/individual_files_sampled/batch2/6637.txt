this segment is presented in partnership with down-ticket TYT and down-ticket want to remind you that every years in election year and with down-ticket you could help even the playing field against big-money and special interests by contributing directly to your favorite candidate just open up the browser on your mobile phone and go to down-ticket calm CNN recently had a focus group conversation with individuals who had voted for Trump this is an ongoing segment that Allison camerota does and I actually really enjoy and appreciate the fact that she does this because I'm curious to hear some of the reasoning that Trump supporters have for voting for him and how they feel about him following a number of controversial stories or scandals that have come up during his administration well this is the first time her panel seems to have legitimate remorse and regret for voting for Trump and there were a number of really fascinating points made that I want to share with you first what did these voters think about the Cavanaugh hearing take a look if you are affected by the Brett Kavanaugh hearings how many of you have really been affected by what you've heard go ahead just the fact that we had to go through this I think it's it's wrong so you believe the women I do the hypocrisy is is astounding to me if they were the a lot of these people are the same people who were railing against Clinton and won a Clinton to be impeach for what he did and now they are supporting Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh for essentially the same thing actly and so now the president calls the women who have come forward a hoax a Democratic hoax what do you make of that language it's just not surprising it's shameful shameful he said he's the hoax if you ask me I'm a victim of rape and to hear this woman sit in front and under oath swear until her story about what happened to her only to have grown men laugh at her mock her I just um I just don't know where the bottom is anymore Wow so I am grateful for that segment because we have seeing so much from Trump's voters that is the exact opposite of what you just experienced and it was disheartening and devastating to see that especially when we showed you a video featuring one Trump supporter at a rally that Emma biglan went to and she started she had accepted essentially that that dr. Blasi Ford had gone through what she claims she had gone through and this female Trump supporter was arguing well close your legs and stop making it look like you you you're you're asking for it I really like camera out a segment on CNN too and it's not because this one happens to agree with us no it's because it gives you a real insight into the voters and most of the time is an appointed out know a lot of the Trump voters are sticking with him that's what this panel was interesting and so CNN is not remotely ringing these as far as we can tell because again the it's mix but mainly still pro Trump which is what the polls indicate and so about Republican voters so it seems accurate based it's not just anecdotal it seems to reflect what the polling indicates as well okay so obviously by definition just picking a bunch of people are anecdotal but it's at least matches the polling so they're not giving you a skewed perspective all right now this is independent voters not Republican voters but they voted for Trump so that's why you're getting a totally different result which by the way is also shown in the polling now I don't know that it's shown to this degree in the polling but it and this is what I've been saying all along numbers are real there is no magic and people are overcompensating for what happened in 2016 since they thought Hillary Clinton was gonna win and they thought she had a 98% chance and she didn't win now they think well all polling must be wrong that's not true I told you at the time what was wrong with those polls not that polls are wrong overall but what was wrong with those particular polls we told you on The Young Turks it was nowhere near 98 percent and then Donald Trump had a real chance of winning and it might have been we guessed on election day around 35 percent and 35 percent happens that it did happen and it happened by a swing of just 39,000 votes in three states so we told you it was possible and it was but the polling is real these are real people he has lost independence he has lost them and when upon when a president is in the 30s that is a disaster for his party an absolute debacle but now everybody's making the mistake in the opposite direction well no I guess the Republic is gonna win anyway no they're not no they're not if the numbers hold and it looks like we've got three weeks left they're gonna get killed in these elections because they've lost independence look at him they're like there's no bottom I mean what Sydney Cohen said there is what I say on the show all the time there is no bottom to that barrel and that is what the whole country is recognized let's take a look at the next clip in this clip they speak specifically about Trump's affinity for dictators around the world Anthony how are you feeling afraid of what the dictator in the White House and what he has no empathy for anything he will never admit when he makes a mistake what were you imagining when you voted for President Trump he said the system is rigged and he said he was going to be a new sheriff in town and all he's done is surrounded himself with crooks how many people have been indicted that were close cahoots with him and they're in front of the world stage he looks at Putin and puts his arm around him and says this is my buddy yeah look Anna these are my guys so I don't I didn't want him voting for Donald Trump I warned people not to vote for Donald Trump but I you know independent voters sometimes are ones that are low information that's in the old days I need to talk about that all the time we've been doing the show for a long time now and then in the New Age a lot of the independent voters are different they're sick of the corruption of both the Republican and Democratic parties okay so these guys all in my opinion and now in their opinion all voted the wrong way but now since they kept an open mind they're like well I didn't vote for this I voted because the system was rigged you're right that's why if Bernie had run and said the system is rigged he would have which is what he said in the primaries he would have won easily they actually wanted someone who was gonna help them not hurt them they voted for Trump these particular folks and independents overall because they were desperate because the system has been crushing them their whole lives I want to also just point one thing out so the majority of the panel does consist of independence you're right jank but there is one person on that panel she's a woman wearing a burgundy jacket her name is Stephanie Martin and she's a lifelong Republican who considers herself part of the Religious Right we're gonna hear from her in a little bit but she's also very remorseful for voting for Trump and honestly that was the person on this panel that gave me the most hope because independents you're right I mean they are sick of the system and and it's a little bit of a wild card how they're gonna vote in any given election but when you start losing female Republican voters who consider themselves part of the Religious Right then finally I mean the the real information the data what's really going on with this administration is getting through to some of his supporters and that's all I ask for all I ask is that they have the accurate information and then they make a decision based on that because what we keep saying over and over again is members of his base who only watch fox news or only read you know Breitbart or right-wing publications that are supportive of Trump and they base their support on that misinformation yeah and look the reason main reason why I like these CNN panels is because it gives you an insight into actual voters this one in particular secondarily because I get to say told you I mean almost everything they're saying is exactly what I've been saying all along and what did I say I said he's gonna lose kansas mobs gonna lose bombs in camp and you know what you were right about that because when it comes if you break down his supporters in terms of demographics he's losing the most support among white women mostly white educated women but white women in general so that's something to keep in mind now the next clip that we're going to show you resonated with me the most mostly because of a statement that was made about his rhetoric so take a look at that the divisive 'no sin this a country right now and the rhetoric coming from the president is a daily exhausting thing I worry that the dictator the wannabe dictator in the White House will make it where we don't even have anymore elections so that was Sydney Cohen and I can I I just can't possibly agree with her more remember these are not Hillary voters she voted for Trump because the people are sick of the system whatever you do do not give them another establishment candidate don't give them a reason to vote Republican again if you give them a populist from the left they're all gonna go left just give him a chance to go left all right now let's go to the Republican woman who would change their mind I think I'm more feeling embarrassed as a lifelong Republican I guess I would consider myself you know part of the religious right and now the values that I see coming from the White House just don't mesh up with what I believe can you pinpoint a moment that you changed from being a president Trump supporters are feeling embarrassed even listening to his the inauguration speech just kind of very dark was dark and antagonistic and there there has not seemed to be any effort to unite the country it's it's always us against someone or these people against someone else ah man I'm telling you they're gonna get killed they lost independence they lost moms in Kansas okay so to that point let's go to the polls I recently I told you about a poll that where the Democrats guy had gone up from an eight-point advantage in congressional elections generic elections throughout the country to 12 points then there was another poll that I added at 13 points new poll out at 14 points they have a 14-point advantage enormous Republicans still holding on to a lead among men they're anywhere two to five points two to five points okay the lead that Democrats I might have among women is now up to 30 points 30 points I can do math five points does not beat 30 points here's another piece of math there's just as many women as there are men in the country so tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick but I got to tell you something the last thing is the most important thing if if people don't go out and vote on November 6 none of it matters and and the only thing that's concerning is there is now a little bit of based on the early voting because a lot of states that allow early voting and you can see not how people voted but who's voting registered Democrats or registered Republicans the democratic energy is not quite at the level that they expected so they're worried about a number of demographic groups that are not showing up at the levels that they were hoping for and believe based on the polling and I got to keep it real with you nobody defends young people more than we do I think you know more you're you know you grew up on the Internet you have access to all that information but young people right now not voting at the levels they need to okay so based on the early voting they if young people show up to vote on November 6th they will route Trump's party they will destroy Trump's party only question is are they going to please do please begging you look man it's it's not just our lives it's everybody's lives that are on the line and I think I've earned some credibility here 16 years doing the Yonkers I never told you a midterm election was the most important midterm election of your life I'm telling you this is it whether you're a woman a young person or just anyone that cares about the country and to me I mean there's they're all right and all those comments the one that resonate the most for me was he's a wannabe dictator he would end our democracy without a second thought my god if he retains power god help us all so you but if the Democrats get control of Congress they can do actual investigations and they can more important than anything else they can block his insane proposals so remember remember the 6th of November get out there and vote like what you see
