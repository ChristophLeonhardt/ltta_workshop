I'm fairly confident that our founding fathers did not intend the process to work this way so far it's pretty much been an intergalactic freak show senator Feinstein's had the letter since July for three months she said nothing nothing zero nada zilch she didn't say anything in the confirmation hearing she didn't say anything in our in our confidential session with judge Cavanaugh when the Senators and the nominee met privately and now after it's all over she produces the letter an accusation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could be a turning point in the battle over his nomination Kavanagh has denied the accusation well now Republicans are questioning the timing of the allegation being made public 20 now Tiffany cross at the beat DC's or Lena Maxwell Sirius XM director progressive programming and Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank I want to start just on that point because whatever else you think of the Republican argument from for ramming through this nomination no matter what Serleena there is something to the argument that senator feinstein had this report in july we even had a congresswoman Maxine Waters on earlier and even she said if you had it and you're not gonna put it out it's no good to anyone right and she didn't even share it with the fellow Democrats on the committee let them decide whether it was something worth questioning him on it illustrates just how much has not changed since 1993 um and previously Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings right you you had a moment in in in that controversy where you felt like the country was moving forward on the issue of sexual harassment and I am disappointed in senator Feinstein in the Michu era you're gonna have to do better when it comes to serious allegations of sexual misconduct and that includes informing the other Democrats and the committee that this letter exists and the allegations joy are actually serious right he's being accused of sexual misconduct and holding someone down against their will and she thankfully got away but it's not something that should be shrugged off as very minor and insignificant and indeed and his corroborating witness his high-school friend who was supposedly in the room as well who said this didn't happen absolutely not this is the friend who's not really helping Mother Jones reports that the friend wrote a book and this is the witness he wrote a memoir about his days in school that book according to Mother Jones chronicles this is a gentle mr. judges time as a teenage alcoholic like many works of the genre it deposed a lot of ink to the kinds of debauchery that leads to a a and recovery well there's nothing in the book that resembles the incident reportedly described in the private letter given to the FBI judge says his own blackout drinking while he and Kavanagh were georgetown prep students that's the school they went to reached the point where once I had the first beer I found it impossible to stop as I was completely annihilated so this is a guy who admits in a book that he got blackout drunk he's the witness and were supposed to say that we believe him and 65 girls who went to a different school and not the woman well it bucks the narrative that the Republicans are trying to paint in this guy but I have to say I think Kavanagh bucked that narrative on his own I mean when he's there in front of the Judiciary Committee which used to be a very genuine exchange I think between lawmakers and nominees now it's gotten increasingly partisan and it's really like a Kabuki theater yep in politics but when you saw him when he got up one day and the parklands students father Heyman tries to approach him and he and he says he didn't know he was right and shrug it doesn't matter you could be decent and nice and we do the fact that I think that they had 65 women ready to go to come out and rewrite and we were talking a little bit in makeup like I don't know 65 people from when I went to high school certainly not well enough to know to testify for my character today so it's almost like they knew this was happening they knew it was coming and they were ready to go with this list of women which shows that what else are they hiding we happy for the documents that nobody had today and one the producer again it doesn't pass the smell right they couldn't produce the document where they give you 65 and your anus is raped every woman they have ever met so producing 65 women that you did not sexually assault is not proof that you did not do something wrong to one other woman yeah let me bring dana Milbank in here because and I should know that Brett Kavanaugh denies the allegations you know in fairness let's let's say that he's put out a statement saying that he didn't do it so let's anote that but what the other piece here data is that Democrats are proceeding and Rachel Maddow has said this and she's absolutely right they are not proceeding as if this nomination is a done deal other than Dianne Feinstein not using this piece of ammunition that she really did have in her quiver since July Democrats are really proceeding as if they can defeat this nomination for the most part but that only works if they all hang together and react together here is doug jones elected mainly on the strength of black women getting him into into office I should know in Alabama on CNN this morning talking about his explanations regarding the nomination I just they think an anonymous letter to derail something at this late date is just not a good practice and I don't think it will happen but there are still time Jake there's still time and I'm sure that there are people talking about this and there's still time for this to come forward and to shed more light on what may or may not have happened back some 30 years ago you know data one of the things that frustrates a lot of Democratic voters baseball quickly younger voters about the Democratic Party is this hyper caution and early capitulation on issues that was that's what that was because what we're eating in the hail is that they're all gonna hang together and wait to see if Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski say yes and then they're gonna jump but this is doug jones jumping early what is going on in the Democratic caucus well look the Democratic caucus at best of times is like herding cats and I I don't want to say that this this this letter this allegation right now is a distraction but it definitely is taking Democrats away from other arguments that could be very successful against Kavanagh and indeed many of them thought they were right on the precipice of victory there now senator Kennedy can call this an intergalactic freak show but what he's actually seeing is America and there's a lot of fury and a lot of tension out there the Judiciary Committee is no longer you know this old club' bastion of older white Christian men so what he sees as a freak show is in fact America reacting to judge Cavanaugh Democrats were very strong on the document' question saying of evidence that he was basically a political hack in the Bush White House clearly Republicans don't want to get that sort of thing out so I I do agree with those who said that this is a legitimate issue but it should have been brought up in the process so that it all could have been considered together rather than make it appear to be a late hit and that's why I think you're going to see Democrats split on this they were in a way kept in the dark by their own senior colleague on the judiciary yes indeed and Dianne Feinstein is the senior she's the ranking member and she had the ability to bring this up and allow people to question Cavanaugh on it even without naming the woman and one of the people who would have been in position to do that was Camilla Harris who was incredibly effective in her questioning of judge cabin all right so here is commonly Harris Senator Harris earlier she was on politics nation with our friend and colleague Reverend Al Sharpton talking about the nomination and laying out the case against it it's not about only his beliefs it's about the fact that he has been an operative mm-hmm a political operative twice in a published opinion he used the term racial spoil system there was a young woman immigrant woman 17 years old who went through every step that the law required her to go through to obtain an abortion and yet he called it abortion on demand because those who would deprive women of their ability to make decisions about their own body are trying to suggest that you know it's just like TV on demand you just click a button and you get it one of the things that diet senator Feinstein did was deprive that woman the opportunity the attitude to interrogate Kavanagh on this issue right that is now being portrayed of the lated right and you know you saw her in the hearings she was until like 9:00 p.m. some days and some of the best moments we miss during the best hours of the day unfortunately because she's right this is about putting somebody on the Supreme Court forever that will take away fundamental rights for women and really families because we're not just talking about abortion Jory we're talking about birth control pills we're talking about contraception and IUDs we're talking about the things that nearly every woman on the planet at some point in her reproductive e reproductive years has used and I think that you know putting somebody on this dream court with that in his background on the record saying abortion inducing drugs when talking about contraception Williams anti-science I'm talking about abortion on demand when we're just talking about women making choices for their own lives joy I think that it's pretty clear where he stands on that issue and then there's all the other reasons yeah you know a sitting president can't be indicted he's also the anti-affirmative action and voting rights is something that is at stake always and so he's bad for many reasons yeah just the women's rights and the duplicates were actually making a good case I got to switch gears just a little bit Dana because I have to play this earlier we didn't get this in early but I want to play it now this is the administrator of FEMA and by the way just on a last note on that it would have been a real corrective to the Anita Hill situation have women be able to flush ran right like it so we have been you know an opportunity to sort of correct something historically wrong but anyway let's go into this this is the administrator of FEMA brock long tina responding to this trump truther ISM on Hurricane Maria it's a pretty astounding unresponsive from the field ministry over here it is one thing about President Trump is is that he is probably the one president that has had more support for what goes on back here and I think he's defensive because he knows how hard these guys behind me work day in and day out for a very complex situation and it's frustrating those studies the Harvard study was done differently than the George Washington study or this study or that study and the numbers are all over the place it's just that squishy Harvard you know they're just out to get the president's what was a popular he is the FEMA administrator does that's the veteran spot strike you as a weird response to Trump saying the deaths didn't happen know that strikes me is exactly the response you would expect from president Trump's FEMA director or president Trump's director of anything if you want to keep your job you publicly praise the boss and you tiptoe delicately to avoid contradicting him in any way unless it is on deep background in a Bob Woodward book or an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times we're to fight but people directory crossly to Maxwell's Dana Millbank have a great Sunday go get yourself some delicious brunch and coming up at the top of the
