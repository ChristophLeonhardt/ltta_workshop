these Democratic congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas thank you very much for being on this morning a lot to talk to you about I'm going to want to start with the issue of the day congressman how do you think the President did yesterday inviting family members and friends and victims of gun violence into the White House and hearing from them I thought that it was very important for him to do that I think that's good that he listened to their stories and had a conversation with them about their experience and what they believe needs to be done I think it's an important first step and we've even heard some promising statements from him about bump stocks and background checks that and some reporting about what the White House may be thinking but remember all of that right now is just talk it has to be turned into legislative action in the coming weeks and months and if that happens it will be a very positive thing for the White House and for the country Jeffrey Goldberg congressman Jeff Goldberg here do you think you know your Republican colleagues very well do you think that they are moving the way you think Donald Trump might be moving that's so hard to tell because the country has suffered through so many of these tragedies we thought there was momentum to do something and then it all fizzles out and nothing happens and the NRA wins again so I hope that this time will be different like many have said it feels like this time is different but and when we go back next week in the house I think I'll have a better sense of you know the chatter there what people are talking about and how they're feeling Roberts Congressman Cokie Roberts here senator Cornyn from your state is talking about legislation with Senator Murphy that's a big change for him do you see change in Texas that he is responding to yeah the senator quarter had talked about that several months back and then again nothing became of it he's talking about it again which is also very positive I hope that it materializes I hope that it's true that he's willing to take action but that's not the only thing that has to happen we also need universal background checks we have to but we have to ban bump stocks and you have to either abandon the assault rifle or assault weapons or limit high-capacity magazines so that somebody can't shoot off 30 rounds before somebody even turns around and has a chance to respond Michael Steele congressman want to shift gears a little bit the immigration debate is still you know sort of seething in the background here we watched the Senate shoot down that one but four bills last week the the ones supported by the president got the the least amount of support what happens on March 6th is this daca issue dead now is this is this something that becomes the new normal we watch the you know daca recipients being escorted out of the country what is this what does this look like on the 6th of March if nothing gets done about by the 5th that's a great question you know many of us have been working day in and day out to try to reach some kind of agreement on this and provide some kind of daca relief especially since 83% of Americans or more support allowing the dreamers to stay here but that marked March 5th date is an important one and what I think you'll see is many stories of people who will be deported and remember the government has all of the information of these young people so they know exactly where they are and if this administration is determined to send send agents to people's homes and a roundup fashion they can certainly do that so you could imagine for the dreamers for daca recipients this is a very scary time a lot of anxiety and fear and in Congress those of us in Congress are just going to keep pushing to get this done NBC News is reporting that federal investigators are probing whether former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort promised a chicago banker a job in the Trump White House in return for 16 million dollars in home loans to people with direct knowledge of the matter say that Special Counsel Robert Muller's team is investigating whether there's a quid pro quo agreement between manna Ford and Stephen caulk the president of the Federal Savings Bank Koch was announced as a member of candidate Trump's Council of Economic Advisers in August of 2016 around the time mana fort left the campaign after reports questioned the millions men afford had received while working for pro-russian interests in Ukraine sources say that three separate loans metaphore received in December of 2016 in January of 2017 from caulks bank were for homes in New York City Virginia and the Hamptons caulk who did not receive a job in President Trump cabinet did not return requests for comment a spokesman for mana for repeated a previous statement saying his loans were over collateralized and above market rate this as legal observers see indications that new charges against Mana Party may have been filed under seal after Muller's team indited indicated last week it has uncovered additional information involving bank fraud the White House did not respond for a request for comment congressman you're a member of the Intel committee what do you make of this and the president's tweet about Jeff Sessions yeah well first I think Robert Muller has Paul Manafort right where he wants him and based on reporting but also based on everything that I've seen over the last year it seems like Paul Manafort has been a shady character for quite some time so there's probably not only that but other things that they can still go after and I suspect that Robert Muller is trying to get Paul metaphore to cooperate with him in this investigation because remember Paul Manafort was the campaign manager of the Donald Trump campaign for a period of time but also was involved with a lot of Russians and Ukrainians and I think with head will have a lot of information if he was willing to speak with the special prosecutor about the relationships that were involved between the Trump campaign and the Russians so I would expect more to come yeah congressmen who became gastro thank you very much for being on
