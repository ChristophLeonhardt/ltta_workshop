JESSE: HE'S PUTTING HIS FOOT IN
HIS MOUTH ONE WEEK AFTER
SNAPPING AT A REPORTER FOR
ASKING IF HE APOLOGIZED TO
MONICA LEWINSKY.
>> I THINK THE NORMS HAVE REALLY
CHANGED IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CAN
DO TO SOMEBODY AGAINST THEIR
WILL.
HOW MUCH YOU CAN CROWD THEIR
SPACE AND MAKE THEM MISERABLE AT
WORK.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY
ASSAULTED SOMEONE TO MAKE THEM
UNCOMFORTABLE AT WORK OR AT HOME
OR WALKING AROUND.
JESSE: BILL WENT ON TO SAY IT'S
A GOOD THING THE NORMS HAVE
CHANGED.
BUT HERE TO RESPOND, DIAMOND AND
SILK.
HE NEEDS TO STOP TALKING ABOUT
THIS.
>> HE'S EMBARRASSING HIMSELF.
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE MIGHT BE
HAVING AN OUT OF MIND, OUT OF
TOUCH EXPERIENCE.
MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO COME CLEAN
ABOUT WHAT HE DID IN THE PAST
AND CLEAR HIS CONSCIENCE.
HE'LL PROBABLY NEVER BE
PROSECUTED FOR ANYTHING.
HE SHOULD BE IN A TIME OUT.
WHEREVER HE IS SITTING.
>> IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAVING A
COME TO JESUS MOMENT.
JESSE: WATCH TONIGHTA BROADDRICK
HAD THIS TO SAY.

WHEN HE RAPED ME AND HE KNOWS
