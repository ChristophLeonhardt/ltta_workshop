1
00:00:01,411 --> 00:00:01,711
YOURS.

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,846
TO THE ECONOMY FOR WHICH IT

3
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:05,982
STANDS, ONE ECONOMY WITH OPEN

4
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:10,253
BORDERS AND LOW WAGES FOR ALL.

5
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:12,522
HENRIQUE ESTEVAN AUTO IS AN

6
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:14,657
ANCHOR FOR UNIVISION, AND HE

7
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:15,258
JOINS US NOW.

8
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:16,793
YOU SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE

9
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:17,493
PERSON, HOW DID YOU END UP IN

10
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:21,531
THE GROUP DEFENDING MS-13?

11
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,433
>> I DON'T THINK ANY HUMAN BEING

12
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:24,834
AS AN ANIMAL, TUCKER.

13
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:27,036
BUT I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND

14
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:28,438
CRIMINALS OR ANYONE ELSE.

15
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:30,740
IF YOU ARE FOR A LAW AND ORDER,

16
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,942
I DON'T THINK DEGRADING ANYONE

17
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:36,245
TO A HUMAN SERVES THAT PURPOSE.

18
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,480
YOU WOULD EXPECT THE

19
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:42,051
TO SPEAK TO NOT JUST THE WORST

20
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:42,652
IDEALS.

21
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:43,286
>> Tucker: SO MS-13 GANGS

22
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:46,823
STABBED A MAN 100 TIMES,

23
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:48,257
DECAPITATED HIM AND RIPPED OUT

24
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,425
HIS HEART.

25
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,494
THEY BEAT A TRAFFIC GIRL WITH A

26
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:55,031
ABOUT 13 TIMES.

27
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:58,034
A NATION SATANIC SHRINE, THEY

28
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:01,471
KIDNAPPED AND A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL

29
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:02,005
KIDNAPPED AND A 13-YEAR-OLD GIR

30
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:02,839
GIRL.

31
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,241
YOU GET OFFENDED, WHY?

32
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:07,143
WHY WOULD PEOPLE WHO DO THAT

33
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:08,544
NEED TO BE DEFENDED BY YOU?

34
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:11,414
WHAT ABOUT WHAT TRUMP SAID GOT

35
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:14,450
YOU GOING?

36
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,419
>> I THINK WE CANNOT PRETEND TO

37
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:17,653
LOOK AT THIS IN A LARGER

38
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:18,254
CONTEXT.

39
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:22,291
WE CANNOT PRETEND THAT THIS IS

40
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:23,993
STARTED WAY BEFORE DONALD TRUMP

41
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:26,229
BECAME PRESIDENT, A TREND OF

42
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:28,064
CRIMINALIZING AND DEHUMANIZING

43
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,799
ALL IMMIGRANTS, AND THE QUESTION

44
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:37,507
WAS ABOUT GANG MEMBERS WHO WERE

45
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:39,242
>> Tucker: I'M NOT HERE TO

46
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:43,513
DEFEND ALL OF TRUMP'S VIEWS, BUT

47
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,081
WAS ASKED ABOUT MS-13 AND HAS

48
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,249
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR MORE

49
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,751
THAN A YEAR, AND HE SAID, THEY

50
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,652
ARE ANIMALS.

51
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,455
YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE TERM, IT'S

52
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:54,724
IMPRECISE OR WHATEVER, BUT IS

53
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:56,426
THERE NO ONE ELSE YOU CAN

54
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:56,826
DEFEND?

55
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:00,263
ARE THERE NOT OTHER WHERE THE

56
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:01,264
PEOPLE BEING ATTACKED?

57
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:03,466
DO YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

58
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:06,769
AND ASK YOURSELF, HOW DO IT HERE

59
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:07,236
AND ASK YOURSELF, HOW DO IT HER

60
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:07,537
HERE?

61
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:13,843
>> I'M NOT SURE WHAT I YOU MEAN.

62
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,244
I STARTED THIS INTERVIEW BY

63
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:17,346
SAYING I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND

64
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,249
ANY CRIMINALS -- >> NO HUMAN

65
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:22,752
BEING IS AN ANIMAL, THAT'S WHAT

66
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:34,564
>> BUT HE'S

67
00:02:45,808 --> 00:02:46,142
ARGUING.

68
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:46,776
>> SO WE ARE ALL ANIMALS.

69
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:47,477
JUST AS A BIOLOGICAL QUESTION.

70
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:48,144
MAYBE THE TERM IS IMPRECISE,

71
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:48,878
MAYBE YOU DON'T LIKE IT, BUT YOU

72
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:49,545
ARE RUSHING TO THE DEFENSE.

73
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,279
AND IT'S NOT JUST YOU, IT'S JOHN

74
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:50,947
HARWOOD, AND THE DEMOCRATIC

75
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:51,614
PARTY WHO IS UNABLE TO ADMIT

76
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:52,348
THAT THE IMMIGRANTS SHOULDN'T BE

77
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:52,648
HERE.

78
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:53,382
AND MS-13 IS PART OF THAT.

79
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:58,588
>> I THINK WE AGREE ON THAT

80
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,857
THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY TO TRY TO

81
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:03,059
ROOT THOSE BAD APPLES OUT OF

82
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,627
THERE.

83
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:07,263
>> Tucker: WHAT ABOUT THE HAS

84
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:07,997
BEEN A COMMUNITY?

85
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:10,066
>> SO THEY WON'T REPORT CRIMES

86
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,934
AND GO TO THE POLICE.

87
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:13,035
>> Tucker: THE HISPANIC

88
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,004
COMMUNITY DOESN'T HAVE THE

89
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:16,873
MONOPOLY ON CONCERNS OF ALL

90
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:17,874
AMERICANS OF ALL COLORS,

91
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:19,675
BACKGROUNDS AND FINESSE TO

92
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,444
FINESSE TO ETHNICITIES ABOUT

93
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:21,844
CRIMES.

94
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:23,045
AMERICANS DON'T WANT ANIMALS

95
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:24,881
LIKE THIS IN THE COUNTRY.

96
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:28,551
AGAIN, I JUST ASK YOU, WHY DID

97
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:30,019
I THINK THAT'S A WEIRD RESPONSE.

98
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:31,454
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO PUT

99
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:33,289
THINGS IN CONTEXT AND I WILL DO

100
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,090
THAT FOR YOU.

101
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,494
THE CONTEXT HERE HAS TO DO WITH

102
00:03:38,494 --> 00:03:42,565
A LARGER -- WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

103
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:46,836
CALLING IMMIGRANTS RAPISTS, AND

104
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:47,837
CALLING OTHERS FINE PEOPLE.

105
00:03:47,837 --> 00:04:00,650
IT HAS TO DO WITH A CONSTANT

106
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,284
REFERRAL TO CRIMINALITY.

107
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,319
>> Tucker: FIRST OF ALL, THEY

108
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,621
HAVE -- WHATEVER, THEY ARE NOT

109
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,490
REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION TO

110
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,025
COMPLEMENT IMMIGRANTS.

111
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:09,325
SORRY.

112
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:12,795
SECOND, YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH

113
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,865
SPECIFIC CASE, HE IS CRITICIZING

114
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:18,634
PEOPLE WHO ARE EVIL, AND ARE

115
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,803
KILLING, ONCE AGAIN, THE POOR

116
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,638
AND THE DEFENSELESS.

117
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:23,706
AND YOU HAVE BEEN DRIVEN SO

118
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:26,042
CRAZY BY TRUMP THAT YOU CAN'T

119
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,044
EVEN ACCEPT THAT AS TRUE.

120
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:30,646
IF I ACCEPT CHARLES MANSON AS AN

121
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,248
ANIMAL, DOES THAT BOTHER YOU?

122
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:35,318
>> OF COURSE.

123
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,252
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

124
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:44,360
BUT GUESS WHAT, LAST YEAR, ICE

125
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,463
ARMRESTS

126
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:50,032
SO FOCUS ON THAT.

127
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:52,668
FOCUS ON THOSE WHO HAVE NO

128
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:53,236
CRIMINAL RECORDS.

129
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:55,238
>> Tucker: PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE

130
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:56,038
ILLEGALLY SHOULD BE DEPORTED.

131
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:57,640
THAT'S WHAT THE LAW SAYS.

132
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,309
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE LAW,

133
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:01,844
CHANGE IT IN CONGRESS.

134
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,747
>> THEN YOU SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON

135
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:05,114
CRIMINALS.

136
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:06,682
YOU SHOULD NOT SPEND YOUR TIME

137
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,551
AND ENERGY OF MOST PEOPLE IN THE

138
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:09,452
BAD NUMBERS.

139
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:12,455
>> Tucker: I'M SICK OF BEING

140
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:15,725
TOLD BY FOREIGNERS ABOUT WHO WE

141
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:19,729
THE LAW SAYS IF YOU ARE HERE

142
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:22,865
WOULD GET DEPORTED AND I FEEL

143
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,166
SAD ABOUT THAT, BUT THAT'S A

144
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:24,867
LOT.

145
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,636
>> WE WERE ALSO CRITICIZING THAT

146
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:28,037
LAST WEEK.

147
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,640
>> FOREIGNERS HAVE NO RIGHT TO

148
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,041
WEIGH IN ON OUR ASYLUM LAWS

149
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,076
BECAUSE THEY ARE FOREIGNERS AND

150
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,044
WE ARE CITIZENS.

151
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:35,845
FINAL QUESTION.

152
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,546
WHY DOES IT NOT BOTHER YOU WHEN

153
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,282
I CALLED CHARLES MANSON AN

154
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:41,651
ANIMAL, BUT IT DOES BOTHER YOU

155
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:46,622
WHEN TRUMP CALLS MS-13 ANIMALS?

156
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:52,995
>> IT BOTHERS ME WHEN ANY

157
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,130
CRIMINAL COMMIT SUCH HEINOUS

158
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,430
ACTS.

159
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,064
PRESIDENT TRUMP SEEMS TO

160
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:58,834
UNDERSTAND VERY WELL WHAT SPEAKS

161
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:04,507
TO THE TRUMP BASE, BUT HE IS

162
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,242
ALSO NOT SPEAKING TO THE OTHER

163
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:08,244
SOCIETIES.

164
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:11,314
>> Tucker: REALLY?

165
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:13,482
ARE YOU THE APPOINTED LEADER OF

166
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:14,450
HISPANICS NOW?

167
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,253
HOW DID YOU GET THAT JOB, WERE

168
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:18,587
YOU ELECTED TO IT?

169
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:22,491
>> NO, I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR

170
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,660
HISPANICS.

171
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,031
>> VERY QUICKLY, HOW DO -- >>

172
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:29,999
THEY ARE FEELING THAT VIOLENCE

173
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,834
AND TRYING TO COME TO THE

174
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,669
COUNTRY, BUT YOU ARE CALLING

175
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:34,670
THEM PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO

176
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,805
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR LEGAL

177
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:36,138
SYSTEM.

178
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:39,342
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE MS-13

179
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:44,647
VICTIMS ARE PEOPLE IN HONDURAS.

180
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:46,549
>> Tucker: LAST THING, I HAVE

181
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:47,850
TO GO.

182
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,018
PLEASE TO CONVINCE THE DEMOCRATS

183
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:51,153
TO RUN IN DEFENSE OF MS-13.

184
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,388
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE A MAJOR

185
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:56,826
MISTAKE TO DEFEND ANY CRIMINAL.

186
00:06:56,826 --> 00:07:00,629
>> Tucker: BUT YOU DO.

187
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,798
THANK YOU, GREAT TO SEE YOU

188
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,432
TONIGHT.

189
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,667
EVEN WHEN HE ADMITTED THAT

190
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,537
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS TALKING

191
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,073
HIMSELF FROM DEFENDING MS-13.

192
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:12,141
JOHN HARWOOD WEIGHED IN ON

193
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,543
TWITTER AS HE OFTEN DOES"

194
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:20,783
HOWEVER REPUGNANT THEIR ACTIONS"

195
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:22,752
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS IN MY

196
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:23,085
OPINION.

197
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,654
>> HE DOES THINGS LIKE CALL

198
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,056
IMMIGRANTS ANIMALS.

199
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,858
>> THE DEFENSE IS THAT HE WAS

200
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:32,328
FOLLOWING UP BY A STATEMENT BY

201
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:35,264
HE WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT MS-13.

202
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,767
GOOD ENOUGH?

203
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,869
A SLIPPERY SLOPE WHEN YOU START

204
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:42,538
DEHUMANIZING PEOPLE THIS WAY.

205
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,642
THAT'S WHAT THE NAZIS DATA,

206
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,377
THAT'S WHAT SLAVE OWNERS DID.

207
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:50,913
THAT'S NOT WHAT HUMANS DO.

208
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:53,082
>> LARRY O'CONNOR IS AN

209
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:53,749
ASSOCIATE OF THE WASHINGTON

210
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:56,085
TIMES AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

211
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:58,721
THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICANS DO,

212
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:01,257
LARRY.

213
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:03,259
>> I DON'T EXPECT MUCH FROM ANNA

214
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:03,592
NAVARRO.

215
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:06,028
YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND MOST

216
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:06,662
TELLING ABOUT THAT CLIP?

217
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:09,732
CHRIS CUOMO, HE SAYS HIS DEFENSE

218
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:12,435
IS -- HE WAS TALKING ABOUT

219
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:12,735
MS-13.

220
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,670
THAT'S NOT HIS DEFENSE, THAT'S A

221
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,138
FACT, IT'S THE TRUTH.

222
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:17,840
THAT'S THE TRUTH THAT THE MEDIA

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,641
DIDN'T REPORT.

224
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:21,444
BUT FOR CHRIS CUOMO TO ACT LIKE,

225
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:22,511
HOW COULD THIS BE?

226
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,948
THAT'S LIKE SAYING I CAN'T

227
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,250
FAMILY AND CHRIS CUOMO, OR ANY

228
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,119
OTHER ITALIAN-AMERICAN.

229
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,053
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

230
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,054
AND THIS IS MY BIGGEST PROBLEM.

231
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,924
AS YOU SAID, YOU SEE

232
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,126
AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE WHO

233
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:42,130
ARE CONDEMNING REMARKS BASED ON

234
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:44,133
YOU WOULD THINK YOU WOULD SEE

235
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,067
SOME CORRECTIONS.

236
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,870
THE BEST THEY HAVE IS, EVEN

237
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,538
MS-13 DESERVES TO NOT BE

238
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:55,277
DEHUMANIZED.

239
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,846
ANIMALS, IF YOU CAN'T CALL THEM

240
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,380
OUT ON REPULSIVE BEHAVIOR,

241
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,448
YOU'VE SURRENDERED YOUR ABILITY

242
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,749
TO MAKE ANY MORAL JUDGMENTS IN

243
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,952
OUR SOCIETY.

244
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:04,453
>> Tucker: THE FIRST DRAFT,

245
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:06,589
AND I DON'T DO TOO MANY MEDIA

246
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:07,323
SEGMENTS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY

247
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:11,427
ARE JUST DUMB, BUT THE FIRST

248
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:13,329
DRAFT OF THEIR STORY SAID TRUMP

249
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,663
HAD ATTACKED UNDOCUMENTED

250
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:15,064
IMMIGRANTS.

251
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,766
>> MIGRANTS, OR MANY WHO CROSS

252
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,667
THE BORDER.

253
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,669
>> Tucker: SO THAT WAS A

254
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:21,904
DEMOCRATIC TALKING POINT.

255
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:26,909
>> IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE LIE.

256
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,444
COMPLETELY DOWN THE MIDDLE, AND

257
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:30,346
I THINK USUALLY THEY ARE, THEY

258
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:33,916
DID THE SAME THING.

259
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,852
THESE BE REPORTERS' IN-KIND

260
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:39,255
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEMOCRATIC

261
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:39,622
COMMITTEE?

262
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:42,992
>> THE ASSOCIATED PRESS BY THE

263
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,360
SEEN WHO FULLY RETRACTED IT AND

264
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,661
DELETED THEIR TWEETS.

265
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:46,962
BUT WHY ARE THEY CALLED UPON ANY

266
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,866
ETHICS QUESTIONS?

267
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,835
THEY SAID, FURTHER CONTEXT,

268
00:09:52,835 --> 00:00:00,000
SUGGESTING IT WAS OUT OF CONTEXT
