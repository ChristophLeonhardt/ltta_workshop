I'M JULIE BANDERAS IN NEW
YORK.
A JUDGE IN PENNSYLVANIA JUST
SENTENCING BILL COSBY TO
THREE TO 10 YEARS IN PRISON
FOR A 2004 SEXUAL ASSAULT.
I'M JOINED NOW BY RICK
LEVENTHAL WHO IS OUTSIDE THE
COURTROOM WITH THE VERY
LATEST.
3 TO 10 YEARS.
NOT AS MUCH AS HE COULD HAVE
SERVED BUT, NONETHELESS,
BILL COSBY IS GOING TO
PRISON, RICK.
>> HE IS, INDEED, JULIE.
NO LESS THAN THREE YEARS.
NO MORE THAN 10 YEARS.
THE JUDGE RULING THAT BILL
COSBY MUST COVER THE COST OF
THE PROSECUTION, $25,000.
APPARENTLY OVER THE FIRST 12
MONTHS NOT TO CONTACT THE
FAMILY OF THE ALLEGED VICTIM
ANDREA CONSTAND OR ANDREA
CONSTAND AND IS SUBJECT TO
SEX OFFENDER PROGRAM.
SO BILL COSBY 81.
AND ACCORDING TO HIS DEFENSE
TEAM LEGALLY BLIND WILL BE
GOING TO STATE PRISON.
IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT
HE WILL FIRST BE TAKEN TO
THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY JAIL
IN LOWER PROVIDENCE TOWNSHIP
TO AWAIT TRANSPORT TO THE
STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTE
PHOENIX NORTH OF
PHILADELPHIA WHERE BILL
COSBY HAD AN ESTATE.
WHERE BILL COSBY TOOK ANDREA
CONSTAND AND HE GAVE HER
DRUGS AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
HER.
THE BAILIFFS OF THE
AGGRAVATED INEL DECENT
ASSAULT CHARGES.
NOW BILL COSBY HAS BEEN
SENTENCED 3 TO 10 YEARS IN
STATE PRISON.
THAT MEANS THAT HE WILL MOST
LIKELY, WE ASSUME PRETTY
SHORTLY BE TAKEN OUT A BACK
DOOR OF THIS COURTHOUSE IN
HANDCUFFS, PUT IN A POLICE
TRANSPORT AND TAKEN TO THAT
COUNTY JAIL TO BE
TRANSFERRED TO A STATE
PRISON FACILITY WHERE HE
WILL BE EVALUATED AND THEN
PRESUMABLY SPEND AT LEAST
THE NEXT THREE YEARS OF HIS
LIFE, JULIE.
>> Julie: LET'S TALK APPEALS
PROCESS AS YOU KNOW, OF
COURSE HIS LAWYERS ARE GOING
TO APPEAL THIS BY SENTENCING
HIM TO 3 TO 10 YEARS.
DOES THAT HURT ACE APPEALS
PROCESS?
DOES IT MAKE IT HARDER FOR
HIS DEFENSE TRYING TO APPEAL
CONSIDERING A MINIMUM OF
THREE YEARS IS NOT NEARLY AS
MUCH AS HE COULD HAVE
SERVED.
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE
JUDGE MERGED THE THREE
CHARGES THAT HE WAS
CONVICTED OF INTO ONE.
HE COULD HAVE FACED 10 YEARS
ON EACH COUNT.
THEY PERSONAL THEM SO THE
MAX HE COULD FACE WAS 10.
THE JUDGE STEAD 3 TO 10
TOUCHING ON THAT MAXIMUM
SENTENCE THAT HE COULD HAVE
RECEIVED BASED ON THE
MERGING OF THE CHARGES.
ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS WAS
WOULD THE JUDGE ALLOW HIM
FREE ON BAIL WHILE HE
CONSIDERED ANY APPEAL THAT
MIGHT BE FILED AND THE D.A.
KEVIN STEELE SAID BECAUSE
YOU DEEMED HIM A SEXUALLY
VIOLENT PREDATOR HE DOESN'T
QUALIFY FOR HOUSE ARREST
THAT MAY HAVE PLAYED INTO
THE JUDGE'S DECISION.
WE'RE JUST NOT SURE ABOUT
THAT.
TELL YOU THIS.
BILL COSBY COULD HAVE SPOKEN
IN COURT TODAY IN HIS OWN
DEFENSE.
HE COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING
TO THE CHARGE ABOUT REMORSE
FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE.
HE DIDN'T DO THAT.
AND THERE WAS TALK BEFORE
HAND THAT HE PROBABLY
WOULDN'T BECAUSE IF HE SAYS
HE HAS REMORSE, THAT
WOULDN'T SUPPORT AN APPEAL
IF HE CLAIMS INNOCENCE.
WE CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN
BILL COSBY IN COURT WAS
INFORMED OF THE
RESPONSIBILITIES HE WOULD
HAVE AS A SEX OFFENDER, HE
WAS TOLD THAT THE VICTIMS IN
THIS CASE WOULD BE NOTIFIED.
BILL COSBY ASKED IF HE HAD
TO NOTIFY THEM AND WAS TOLD
NO.
AND COSBY, ACCORDING TO OUR
PRODUCER IN THE COURTROOM
REPLIED GOOD.
SO, THAT'S BEING HANDLED BY
THE STATE.
BILL COSBY IS NOT NOTIFYING
HIS OFFENDERS.
HE HAS BEEN TOLD YOU CAN'T
CONTACT -- EXCUSE ME, HIS
VICTIMS.
AND THERE IS ONE CONFIRMED
VICTIM HERE BUT MORE THAN 06
WOMEN CLAIM THAT BILL COSBY
ASSAULTED THEM.
AND SEVERAL OF THEM WERE IN
THE COURTROOM.
INCLUDING FORMER SUPERMODEL
JANET DICKERSON SHE WAS HERE
TO HEAR THE SENTENCE READ
INSIDE THE COURTROOM IN
NORRIS TOWN COURTHOUSE.
WE EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM A
D.A. AT A NEWS CONFERENCE.
PROBABLY SOME OF THESE WOMEN
WHO HAVE BEEN SPENDING MUCH
OF THIS TIME IN THE
COURTROOM WHO CLAIM BILL
