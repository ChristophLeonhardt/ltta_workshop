that's the great thing about America you know people love to talk about how hard it is and how little opportunity there isn't and and to me I have to tell you there's just a bunch of crap this is still the greatest country in the world for opportunity the only people that tell me there's no opportunity America our people in America when I travel the world we are still the beacon of free enterprise is it hard to get ahead absolutely but if you want to start a small business this is one of the best places America is a land of immigrants anybody that wants to close our borders and not let people in is being short-sighted America wouldn't be America without them my parents your parents scratch the surface we're all immigrants I say let people in this is the land of opportunity
