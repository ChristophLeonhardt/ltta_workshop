on over to the daily wired.com click subscribe you can become a subscriber you will have our appreciation and that's all they put on the teleprompter after every episode when Jeremy approaches mean he says I'm gonna do so much better next it's good have hope yeah exactly these sad things you can't make up the new cycle so anything like what do you even talk about on this show it's not for of material that's it there's how do you filter it all out but I feel that for the purposes of this show which is not a topical new show it's a conversation in which we try to make each other laugh or make each other think usually it's yeah I think that there's a fun intersection of two stories that happened this week that provide I was gonna say fertile ground I think happy happy hunting ground might be the better might be the better use of language and that is the story of horse face and the story of Pocahontas focus at the intersection of these two things we have the greatest moment in the history of American politics true I I have to say I know this doesn't fit well with the daily wire ethos but ever since Cavanaugh was confirmed I have been a state of political bliss I have just a bit you know because at every moment at every moment in history there's something to dread every moment but there's not always so much great stuff to celebrate right and so what I see in this this intersection is I see this wonderful transformation with Elizabeth Warren with Foca Honda's but identity politics is actually on the run and it's actually on the run because Trump is driven the left so crazy that they don't know what to throw at him next it's like you know I'm an Indian I don't know anything there's a woman take a woman by God is man and they look insane and on the other hand you have Donald Trump who is he does that kind of genius of his now occurred to me in forcing the press to cover what he wants them to cover so you sit there and you go like how how could we have a president who slept with a porn star and that was calling her horse face on Twitter on the other hand now press not have a president without a president Lincoln could have could have been only but but you does force the press the press now has to say he's called her that after he won a court case oh and they wouldn't do it they would bury that straight angry because I've been I've been calling I'm always angry but this one I'm actually angry about I really was desperate to get the White House to write Elizabeth Warren a nine hundred thousand twenty four million because that is what her native-american ISM is worth apparently because she was willing to capitalize on it but now she wanted him to give a million dollars based on her being Native American which she obviously is not you know again it's not that I'm loath to credit President Trump with this stuff I just wonder if the identity politics movement was ready to eat its own and you're right the President Trump can he has a unique capacity like iron filings to a magnet to draw or to flies to to the to the zapper to draw the media to him and so him just saying Pocahontas over and over and over made Elizabeth Warren mad which is kind of an astonishing thing these Elizabeth Warren's not stupid I mean I know Elizabeth Warren she's a professor at the law school I attended called Harvard and she went you want to hurt me it's amazing right so she she was you know a pretty good professor apparently I didn't I actually did a mock class with her when I went and visited and she was very famous for her use of Socratic methods in the classroom and she was always very lively and so she's pretty well-liked around campus she's very much left even at the time the first time I met her it was she ripped on Rush Limbaugh we were at the top of the W Hotel in down to in Westwood I mean they're in drops can we get him yeah she she was trying to recruit everybody who's at this dinner and she walks up to me and she knew that I'd written a book at that point and so she walked up my shadow so you're a right winger and I said yeah and she said well do you know you're one of those Rush Limbaugh P boys I have you ever listened to Rush Limbaugh and she said now of course not right and I said well then you don't know what you're talking about do you and so you know always making friends and she was like that always but she was not stupid and this was just insanely stupid that's the part that was bewildering about it is the it was only bewildering if you don't understand a point the Jeremy made online right which is that she was counting on the media to cover her no matter what's in it and they did and they did and they did I mean they ran with the headline and she was actually a Native American based on the idea that one relative ten generations ago maybe was Native American Rachel Dolezal is undoubtedly significantly more black genetically and Elizabeth Warren is they ran with it they defended her and then they dropped it and the reason they dropped it is Chris Wragge began these little voices everywhere this is why I wish that the president had written the check for $907 you need the image but you need the image and you and also because one of the reasons that the media was able to run with the story as a success run with it as a victory for Elizabeth Warren is because they know that people don't really understand numbers and so the you know one in 1024 is obvious to people who understand math that that's a very very tiny fraction but by giving the check for 960 some dollars saying you know 900 bucks is 2 1 million what Elizabeth Warren yes my favorite is my favorite tweet next to yours cuz you're the god king of course but on the merits my favorite wheat was from Matt's ideas shop who put out one 1020 forth of the movie Pocahontas which was have you ever heard that one at Daily wire the election one well the election was fantastic Elizabeth Warren won over 20 20 might have to buy it I don't really buy our merch I try to steal in wardrobe I'm gonna have to buy them yeah that was pretty solid also I did I really asked for a specific meme from our from our social media folks but I ran in I was late for the show and everybody's trying to get me into the studio and I literally ran down the hall the other way with them screaming at me so I could go to the social media room and tell them that they needed to make a meme with the Lone Ranger is Trump and Tonto is Elizabeth Warren and and stormy Daniels happened five days after Kanye West was in the Oval Office oh you think that it can't get more ridiculous fortunately you'd be wrong somebody somebody tweeted me isn't there a time when this bit when this becomes unfunny I said that time is not now if you're if you're 20 if you're 20 and you don't find this funny it's because you have no heart if you're 40 and you don't find this funny it's because you have no brain I mean you have a well-known Harvard Law School professor and popular senator progressive who just destroyed herself like a dying star in order to win identity politics wheel of fortune what do you tell us before the midterms - yep going in yeah that's right right at that moment one of the widest women in American politics chose to identify herself as an aggrieved minority to win intersectionality points in an election that doesn't happen for two years and this is the one of the things that I've realized that's gonna make the primaries so delightful with the Democrats over the next 24 months is that they think already every single one of them avenatti Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris they all think that they're already running against Donald Trump but they actually still have to face one another yeah that is and so Elizabeth Warren can think well there's the media will cover for me with Republicans with this outlandish claim a bin you're the one who pointed out yeah but the other people who want to be nominated won't wreck Amaris will get on stage with her and she will say how dare you how dare you seize upon minority honest you know exactly right tears of rage I'll be honest at this point I'm totally reading for entertainment value if I desperately want Michael avenatti to actually do the nominate all did you see that video of him talking about stormy Daniels okay if you want to know what the video is about you gotta wait

really people in the history okay so all this prompted me Jeremy was asking me earlier today like so what should we talk about so we were talking to talk about all of the the identity politics and and the insanity of Michael a banana first of all if our guys are in the back and you have time go pull the Michael avenatti video just because it is spectacular I showed it I showed it yeah I show this to this jerk earlier and it was it is legitimately one of the great videos in the history of the man really okay that's so good so good so guys you can hear me in the back go get it right now the avenatti video you know the other thing I know they won't let him go in just like trumpets just like trunks right one the media created and they won't let him go and then they're gonna be surprised when he starts winning primary you're not gonna be fantastic laughing are you you know what I don't even care I don't really think I agreed I marry I admit I'm right to stand on a stage with avenatti Stakes and avenatti no one really does he'll say no one has brought down him from harder than I have a try harder and longer I put back in the table there's only one Donald Trump please god I think I have to say that there's been so much great punch the line material this week Donald Trump sitting across from Kanye I'm watching the slow pan so Donald from space as he watched Kanye it was as though Donald Trump had suddenly realized what it's like for the rest of us to watch Donald Trump it was like it was like it came Jeb Bush and you can just see that the Curb Your Enthusiasm music playing in the background as Kanye West railed on about hydrogen powered airplanes and Trump was like I don't even know why I'm here but I'm not the richest person here more than those charismatic person here and slightly fascinated but also repelled took over Barack Obama's Prescott yes but what Jeremy was saying is what should we talk about so I said you know what let's do some culture stuff okay so Jeremy would you like to introduce the question the question of the day that I mean now you're my meat puppet so I'm actually just forcing you to the question of the day brought to you by endo t know the question of the day for face we have horse face and we have Elizabeth Warren Native American Iowa yeah and so the obvious question is what's your favorite what's a good point maybe this this may be my favorite was now I I love westerns I love all mystery I mean if it were if it were Western it would have to be called right tiny and the horse heads that was what I called my column this morning you know I love westerns I mean it almost all westerns and it is really interesting that when the westerns were great westerns were coming out all the critics were sitting around going you know it's really the French film that is brilliant and then we go back and we see it was I'd watch that film that by the way it's it's it's garbage garbage I went back one summer announced I'm gonna watch these French films everybody severally so that and then you go along with that and I wanted to just die you go back and watch stagecoach is one of the most beautifully shot perfectly composed films ever but the the movie that I think stands out for me as the western of westerns the Western that says what Western said is High Noon yeah and the reason is is it says to you in the in the wilderness in you know the Western is about same thing that the chivalric stories are about it's about that moment in history when men can be men for the good so in other words you can commit acts of violence and aggression for the good you're basically building the world in which women will build the civilization you're clearing the ground in which women will come in and build families and build homes and that's a wonderful moment for men because they get to shoot each other and kill each other and it's you know but but you're the goose island in fire that's all in good fun and this is the moment when you find out why it is because left on their own in a wilderness people are savages except for the guy who's not you know except for the one guy who says I stand for this I represent this I will walk down this road but against I can it was a for guys who come after him yeah I will walk about and he is put surrounded by values that simply will not work no matter how good they sound in court including the Quaker pacifism of Grace Kelly if I would buy pacifism from anybody it would be Grace Kelly the first truly the first woman I ever loved Grace Kelly and she's a pacifist and it's just about the fact that no that's not gonna do just another restraining order there was this real trend in Hollywood of movies and there's another one with with Gary Cooper I think where he plays a Quaker friendly persuasion I don't know what it was the word they're like you know what screw the Quakers just a little bit about about High Noon not in terms of its quality but in terms of the message this is something Ben and I were talking about earlier because you say that the Western is great because it's the moment when men are men and create the opportunity for then women to come along and build civilization that's also in some ways the theme of the man who shot Liberty valance but it's a great movie but High Noon is kind of a rebuke of the man who shot Liberty valance I think because the man who shot Liberty valance very directly makes the point you're making we need the John Wayne's of the world to create a world to create the circumstances where we can have the better angels the Jimmy Stewart's come in the problem is the very next thing that happens in Jimmy Stewart's world is High Noon takes place and we now remember that it's not that you need men to be men before you have civilization you need men to be men continuous continuously in order that civilization but that is what high noon happens because all civilization fails them and what's wonderful about High Noon is amazed by a liberal as a liberal statement but because it's a great story it tells a conservative story and they just can't say I heard a Clermont critique of High Noon because this is Bill Clinton's favorite movie his movie and the Grace Kelly I'm telling is the pretty blonde Thea no question but he but the the critique was that it leads to a sort of messianic complex High Noon which is that there's no civic virtue everybody in the town is bad except for this one guy who is the the guy who stands up to evil and that's really not the way that history works you require more than one man in any given in any given situation in order to truly stand up to to evil yes of course you do but it but it is a story and it's an allegory yes and it's an allegory and it is the ally we were just talking about this off stage actually before we came in here about the fact that without that one guy who stands for virtue nobody stands for okay so I do want to find out everybody else's favorite westerns but I have to show this avenatti Club yeah it's just you that it's a sad day in America when the President of the United States calls a woman a horse-faced Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself I don't care if you're on the right the left or the center no man should call a woman a horse-faced especially the President of the United States I have two daughters I think it's a disgrace I don't care what your political persuasion is you should condemn it as well it's wrong make an impromptu statement sound like reading from a television movie take on that right like if he's his internal monologue his going don't laugh when you say haven't I laughed okay take number two okay so when the the principal happen that this woman this porn star who sleeps with a guy on her own free will for money blackmails and is it takes the money and then doesn't agree to the deal when did she become a hero you know what Michael feminism no okay yeah that seriously that's all it is yes she doesn't like Trump she happens to be a woman that's all do you think it's a pun I instantly thought a lot of support like this is that no I was fine no genius where he's a genius at the nicknames you can't say he's not he's not a genius at the nicknames when he uses the same rotation of five nicknames this one was new and excited I'm not saying that it's impossible because it's possible that he actually would try to spell horse face is like the first man I think highbrow Safari means that all work together in the same way that's exactly I mean if there's anybody who's the king of solid systems like a white chief speaking of collapsing on your stuff no no yeah you know you picked that you picked the best westerns I also like I was I was saying up watched searchers the other day and the thing with that I love all of these movies but the Millennial attention span has been reduced to nothing yes to that of a fly so when I watch it with my friends or whoever they fall asleep within like three seconds and I'm really into it I'm like a product of Nick at Nite and came out smoking a cigar but I will I will then offer as one of the great a great Western in its own right the superhero movie Logan because it translates the Western that's right into a living form and it made that form which is terrible much better it's true it's also a massive cop-out it cowboy hat but I do like that it's a living form though you know it takes it takes this form that I love so much and it translates it into a way that even Millennials with the zero attention taken is basically a Western yeah yeah that's not true he's actually making the statement the filmmakers actually making the statement because it it is all about Shane and about translating a modern world losing as a gunfighter and they're saying that Shane is a famous famously a christ story and it's saying this is the way we translate this story down the ages and now we're doing it again I wish they weren't doing it in the stupid story we're gonna sail right past that or Shane is a Chrysler he descends into the valley he saves the valley and off he goes and you know he died doesn't mean it wasn't just about a cow Milly hey come back Shane no sorry about the book by the way okay fine Alex Ladd which by the way by the way we didn't know you recommend the books meaning this is for one of the great American novels it really is like 70 pages long it's so that it's so it really is it really is true what I love about saying though is that Alan Ladd is really short rags one see where he jumps off his horse and disappears in a box but not that scene so since the days of the Western stamps calm cut the earth stagecoach is a more there is no Pony Express what do you have well we do have is the capacity to get

our business in particular you know what people avoid any interaction with any guys stamps.com for like marital advice friends are stamp stuck or user questions subscriber questions and for that we turn to Alicia Krause I'm here I have a quick subscribe to subscribe the subscriber questions I am of course an employee here and a subscriber do you guys count McClintock as a Western because if so it's my fav yeah such a good movie we could probably do top John Wayne movies under a - John Wayne movie yeah Big Jake yep Jake is really enjoying Jake is really enjoyable is great here I love those old John Wayne movies well yeah you are yellow ready yeah yeah and the one for DES Patchi these were man straightest movies ever made and and we have to say this Hondo is one of the underrated films of all time seventy minutes long it's a complete history of the West in seventy minutes and it has the most wonderful thesis about the Indians which was their way of life was good but you can't build a civilization on pure honesty and that that's a one you know that lies are the beginning of civilization and it's a one decide on them in uh let's no no there's a way before Palma's yeah this is said Louie little more is Louis L'Amour's version of Shane okay but it and it but it's just it has this wonderful idea in it that in order to build the civilization you have to start lying and the Apaches I think is the Apaches I can't remember who it is but they were thrown now they won that's the warm family that's what is it but they're more a tribe but it's that they won't lie the one thing they want to is like so they can't build a civilization and John way says it was a good way of life but it's over this is how you know Elizabeth Warren isn't actually because when she says that her paternal grandparents would not accept her mother because she was so obviously so obviously Delaware and Cherokee meaning possibly one 512 yes okay so back to subscriber questions and if you're wondering how can you ask a question of the guys we'll be sure to head over to Daley we're calm to subscribe and ask your questions in the chat box over there only subscribers can ask the questions much like our monthly conversations with all of our amazing hosts first question for you guys comes from Matthew and he's saying hey all liberals regularly tell me how great RBG is he'd be interested in hearing your thoughts to the contrary and welcoming the talking points as to why she is not a good justice I think we should let knowles answer this I suffered through that whole yeah yes really I watched it because I just stayed it I watched that whole for arson I know yeah like RBG you know falling asleep at the SCOTUS that was me watching this thing it is look to call it a hagiography is under doing it under I mean it the triumph of the will is a yeah seriously I mean it but she's just awful you know her I mean you can speak more to her jurisprudence which is awful she's been naked ly partisan and political for her entire career her confirmation hearings were extolling the virtues of abortion and why it's a good thing for it to be legal everywhere and why must be legal everywhere she's criticized openly dropped Donald Trump during the campaign during his presidency she's just awful and the amazing thing about this movie with her they are notorious RBG which i think twenty leftists use the phrase and they're trying to pretend it's this culture me that isn't the thing it is not a thing but the they try to make it out in the movie like she's the first woman on the Supreme Court she's the second Ronald Reagan put the first ones right I want to forget the first one as much as anybody right but that where's the Sandra Day O'Connor movie and moreover where's the Scalia movie where's the they just make it there's a Thomas movie but it's about Annie to help exactly right that's the only way that we can do this exactly the fact is that Thomas's story is so much better than anything that Ruth Bader Ginsburg has to offer his personal story growing up like the son of a sharecropper it's so rude it's so American and they would never make that movie the only way that we can portray him is as a sexually rapacious black man that's really what HBO did to him Yeah right with he'll need a hill and it's in it really is astonishing Ginsburg as a justice to take garbage justice she's not even she doesn't even make a tempt to relate her political leanings to the Constitution of the United States or to the law at issue she has a unique capacity to simply ignore whatever constitutional provision is in front of her in order to achieve the desired result she is the perfect like the the Platonic example of legal realism she has a certain end that she seeks she's an end about it she's almost on Association well I mean sure her woes her history shows that she was over at now right she was who's the in-house counsel and now and and in they took this I mean that that's ridiculous that that is legitimately the equivalent of the Republicans nominating the in-house counsel over at the NRA you need to be Supreme Court justice they did this with no questions asked and Republicans basically went along with it because Republicans are fools orrin hatch loved her okay so I respect you judge I respect that's when we got the Ginsberg rule right which isn't it you you're allowed to avoid any serious question about your future jurisprudence simply by saying I won't answer that because I don't have all the facts in my disposal or I won't answer any future case based on what's in front of me which was the result of working which the Democrats also did so we haven't had an honest answer in a judicial confirmation hearing in the last 35 years since it since my birth or it should be said it should be said that we now have three examples Bork Clarence Thomas and Cavanaugh of this attempt to destroy the life of a man who simply is a constitutional originalist whereas we have nothing nothing to nothing remember that is a nothing with even with Ruth Bader Ginsburg right and she won she won their biggest complaint is that Republicans wouldn't vote on Merrick garland because he would have been voted down by a Republicans on it right that is that their base coming but we didn't destroy Merrick Garland's life not at all we all thought okay Tamara Carlin seems like a nice guy he just you know the most is your big brother they brought in this liberal justice to replace Antonin Scalia where every time a liberal judge goes out worship we got a replace we have to replace that we like with like yeah it's it's absurd so I don't know very much about legal thingies I just I just know that if you if your nickname calls to mind soviet-era of rocket launchers find it amusing have 11 tries to turn her into this counterculture cool thing right because it's supposed to be notorious yeah Vig right that's the the rapper did I get that right well good for me but it's been trying to turn a an 88 year old woman because she's she's in her late 80s late hundred eighties yeah and she trying to turn her into like the hot new thing and the the exemplar my favorite my favorite thing is when they put out that picture of her doing the plank oh I thought if she's in that position for the next three months check on her diet BuzzFeed went and like worked out with her like I can't even do the the work is Regensburg can do it's like well if you can then you should go check with your doctor your old woman can do but she's throwing those little tiny little you know in their movie they have her doing put and they have this like super fit room like shake weight the trainer gazes she's amazing she's like a cyborg this is she's doing real push-ups you look at the push-ups I'm look I mean the woman's a hundred years old she and whatever she's going a quarter of an inch yeah I mean there isn't barely any movement it is undistinguishable from rigor mortis and they're saying she's doing real push-ups it's just lay it does remind me exactly of the Terminator I have to say I didn't get to do my favorite Western well coming back to these westerns but we're still we're still just fine fine do more question to my well paid ten bucks a month yeah have their questions answered I don't want to hear about your favorite Western they want to know what does Andrew Clavin think we will see if the will we see the rise of an alternative political party this question comes from subscriber named Chris not necessarily a third party but maybe he thinks that there will be a replacement of either one or both current parties within the next generation or so so my favorite Western is you know I think I think that the Democrat Party is in genuine trouble and I think that if they're not in trouble we're in trouble because they have seriously lost the story of America we are no longer dealing with two parties with different visions of America where you're dealing with one party with various visions of America and one party with visions of an entirely different kind of country when I say different I mean older the old-fashioned idea of centralized government governance without individual liberty it is not the American story it's not the American experiment so my personal opinion since most things are not that dramatic most most of history is not that dramatic I suspect that the Democratic Party is going to move back toward the center at some point if they lose enough on the other hand you know anything can happen I don't know what the future is but but my guess would be if I had to put some down some money I would say the Democratic Party is gonna have to reform itself or really put itself permanently out of power I do not think we're gonna turn into Venezuela any third parties but I think that we've already watched a certain level of capture of the Republican Party first by the tea party and then by Trump and I think you've watched an internal capture of the Democratic Party by the intersectional identity politics wing of the Democratic Party and that will continue happening because whoever is the most extreme loudest voice in the room has certain advantages right there there's this Nikolas innocent Aled has this this theory I think it's called the reorientation but basically the idea is that it's not that hard to get a large group of people to assume an extreme viewpoint all you have to do is start with one person who's very loud so if you have a member of your family who's a vegetarian and therefore members of your family and your wife's cooking dinner because it's a traditional family and she decides that night what dinner am I gonna cook is she gonna cook two dinners is she gonna cook meat for everybody else and vegetarian for the for the daughter is she just gonna cook vegetarian for everybody she cooks vegetarian for everybody just to avoid the blowback and the extra work that family now goes to a party and they say well we have to do vegetarian for our daughter right now the entire party is doing vegetarian to do that and you're seeing that with I think the most the loudest elements of each party the most intransigent I think would be the best way to put it the most intransigent element of each party is going to be what drives future of each party and so you're gonna see the parties continue to radicalize I see I don't think that's true because I think that one of the things about conservatives and we keep forgetting that just happens to be good luck for us is it works you know when people do conservative I mean look at San Francisco this is one of the most beautiful cities in America it's turned into a trash and because of leftist governance this happened is how are you expecting a Republican to be elected any no but this happened before it well this happened in the 70s what is happening to San Francisco and Chicago now happened in the 70s to New York and New York you would have sat there and said are you gonna tell me that New York would elect a conservative Republican and that's exactly what it did but there were Rockefeller Republicans who are being elected New York came at the time in Mayor John Lindsay was removed yeah became a Democrat though yes that's true but there was at least a record of somebody in the recent historical paper having voted for a personal yeah the concern is that if you look at places like Detroit which fall into true ruin after generation after generation of of radical Democrat rule you don't see any sort of self correction take place at the end of that because the the thing that the Democrat Party has that we lack is that they can break things and then say that the only solution is more of what broke it well but that that works for a while but it doesn't always work look that that is this is a possible future you're absolutely right it's a possible future but it's also truly a possible future that suddenly you know got guys like Chuck Schumer he's not a radical you know he's a man Smith scary's you're watching him nationally radicalizing you're under nine there's a machine animal and if he thinks that this is going to destroy the party which it might if he thinks that he'll corrupt and don't you think also the the Trump capture of the Republican Party is not a I don't think it's a further radical yeah I think it's actually a pull back toward yeah moderation I think the tea party was far more radical than Donald Trump in terms of policy but not in terms of rhetoric yeah most intransigent like the tea the crossover between the tea party and Trump is one of the weirdest things in American politics simply because you're right that the political agenda is certainly not the same but the the emotional drive is the same which is rebellion against the established authority and you're seeing the same thing in the Democratic but the thing about the Trump that justifies Trump is the rhetoric that has been coming from the media not because remember the media drives the left in a way that it yeah people don't see that he is he is the first guy who was actually fighting the battle that needs to be fought I'm not arguing yes but but again he is he has become the representative and I don't know how much of this is accidental idol here's a place where I would agree with you that I don't think it's Trump's genius that's driving him I think Trump has been cornered into good governance in some ways but but he has been quite as gratified yeah he has been cornered into good governance the people who will follow him anywhere are following into governance which is what is actually a wonderful thing I mean I I know that I missed out since Cavanagh but this is really a wonderful moment weirdly unblessed absence course such this is different because the effort that went into yes dear absolutely run gore search what they did and the fact that listen I'm ambushed out for now - yeah what remix from an election exactly different for such because Gorsuch was evidence that Trump could do things better than we might have feared that he would do what makes Kavanagh so much more encouraging I actually think it may be a worse pick from in my crown you know but it's a better action from the concerted right that's what it took now when you say Lindsey Graham is a hero you go like wait I'm sorry what yeah because Lindsey Graham actually is Jimmy Stewart from the man who shot Liberty you have to watch that movie along radical hot take I've ever heard Bravo company manufacturing second amendments important to all of us that you can't have a Western with without the Second Amendment man well when the founders crafted the Constitution the first thing they did was make sacred our right to bear arms and you know how strongly we all believe in the right to bear arms I'm a gun owner who else in the rooms and gun owner hands up and owning a rifle is an awesome responsibility building rifles is no difference which is why Bravo Manufacturing was started in a garage by marine vet more than two decades ago to build a professional-grade product that meets combat standards BCM believes the same level of protection should be provided to every American regardless of whether they're a private citizen or a professional BCM is not a sporting arms company the design engineer and manufacturing life-saving equipment that is the goal of the gun that's the purpose of the Second Amendment it's not so you can shoot animals and it's that you can preserve her life and assume that each rifle leaving their shop will be used in a life-or-death situation by a responsible citizen every components of a BCM rifle is hand assembled tested by Americans to a life-saving standard to learn more about Bravo company manufacturing head on over to Bravo Company MFG comm you can discover more about their product special offers and upcoming news that's Bravo Company MFG comm

love about Bravo Company and some of our other sponsors who we who we get to do ads for sometimes like black rifle cause these veteran founded oh yes it's awesome or one of the great things that's happened I think right in the last 20 years and it's not like veteran Zemin's starting companies in America all along I think we have this fresh wave of it going on right now and if they make great products maybe not the most way out because they depend on products like this is one of the things in the arts one of the things that you see is arts die when they become a super intellectual or or when they're dying they become super intellectual and and the interesting thing in America is because of all the great technology and because of the individual innovation the arts are always kind of slipping into something else it's like oh you want to put up stupid paintings on your wall will invent video games and we'll do art that you've never seen before that you can walk right into and that's happening with these internet businesses too I mean these guys is just just as they thought that we're gonna regulate us into death suddenly this whole system of building businesses that popped up it's great so flex a question about the Western I know because I find it no because ok story might to my son politically incorrect story so my son is two and a half years old so that's the politically incorrect issue assigned to gender wait it gets worse so my son my son is two and a half years old and he's got an older sister and she leaves her slippers and her stuff around everywhere so she left like these princess shoes around and my son walked over because he's a little kid and he put on the princess shoes and I said no you're not putting on the princess you're a boy I know I'm a monster he's history's greatest monster and he started to fuss and he started get upset because they're cute and they're shiny and whatever so you put some back on I said no we're not doing that and so I said here's what were doing we get in the car we go over to the Western Outfitters over here on Van Nuys and we go in and we got him some cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a great dad favorite thing he's walking around going cowboy game if I put on ladies shoes will you buddy I mean there's nothing I can do to fire you yeah I mean but this is one of things about westerns that is great is there is this idea this embedded idea it's one of the reasons the Western is kind of dying now there's an embedded idea of gender roles that is politically wildly incorrect yeah and in westerns and what's funny about that is that the women in westerns are typically a lot stronger than the women that you see in a movie nowadays really mentioned I do it I mean there's a woman who Quaker who walks out and shoot some yes and maybe that in McClintock his description of Marina O'Hara and what she did in how she helped build the West and then he's talking to some you know modern woman like as what a woman is you know and it's actually it's interesting in the Bible because obviously feminists hate the Bible because they hate God they dislike some of the gender specific things that take place in the Bible you know they want to fight against even God identifying using masculine terms but they especially when a rebellious what they see is that or push backing is what they see is the the patriarchal aspects at the Bible that that what they want to change the word woman I mean you probably saw this yes we're just in the West weeks because they don't want man to be in right the idea of woman as a helpmate to man is offensive the idea of of from Ephesians of men as the head of their household or the head of their wife that they're offended by but they they make it sound as if the biblical view of femininity is that women it's almost this far yes servile Far Eastern view of femininity or something that actually isn't present in the Bible like the women in the Bible because you have female submission is key to the idea of women is what they think that's right but but the women in the Bible who are the biblical example of women are strong you drive a tent pole through a man's forehead you're okay with listen your wife now yes and Sarah's overseas a vast household you she has she actually has a job her job isn't right Moses his wife has to circumcise their child and Moses forgets to do it I mean the actual imagery of the rib is important because if you know it's not that she was plucked from the foot of daddy he's can't trod on her it's not that she's plucked from the head she just plucked from the rib right from the side there is a spiritual equality that is evoked you see this in westerns too to your point that the the women in westerns are strong characters they're they are not men but they are not servile a third class taken for granted citizens either their their typically work with their hands they typically oversee the activities of these ranches or the activities you know they they don't suffer fools lightly it was realistic they're much more real this is this is what the one point that I will grant to feminism which I just hate feminism I think it is a destructive bad philosophy and I don't think it was wishing when we say family I think we should clarify just for those who aren't listening I think all of us in the room when we talk about hating feminism what we were talking about a second and third wave feminism well not women not women voting or having you know because I think that that is part of classical liberalism right extension of classical liberalism I feel the necessity for Media Matters tonight all right I'm with auntie first wave feminist mostly second wave was fine you know but but but the thing I will grant them is the Industrial Revolution did take away the housewives economic power because it took it took what used to be home industries and put them in the factories and I think we have correcting for that by first of all the interesting so that is amazing you know it's always technology that fixes technology right but but I think that there is that there is that element of truth in what they're saying which has nothing to do with men except for men inventing stuff you know I mean every freedom that women have every extension that through technology it's because of the invention of a guy sitting around going oh here's a good idea you know birth control whatever you know I mean it's these are the things that have granted women a new world which I think we're all in favor of I mean we want women the whole thing about the West is that women have always been a history of women was marriage yeah is the single best invention actually three of them and it's the first thing that the feminist trying to murder well because they're really I mean they made women on happy I mean that there's a really fascinating longitudinal study about female happiness from 1917 to depressants and what it shows is that in the era of abortion and radical feminism and women's rights and rah-rah me too that female happiness has gone down markedly across Western civilization this is why when we say that gender roles are politically incorrect I always worry about that because I don't think women think that one of one of the reasons that one of the reasons the left always throws women under the bus first have you noticed this they will throw they will throw women under the bus but yeah they throw any it's because women actually don't want what the left are selling if they if they sit and think about it what they don't want us to be told that they're second rate that they're second perhaps that they're not they're not full citizens they're not full participants in the Western private listening that story about my son I should I should amend my wife saw my son putting on these shoes and she came to me and she said I don't want him putting on these shoes right let's go do something about how's he gonna get back to Kansas but again we live in a society where that is considered wildly sexist and terrible maybe I'm denying him in his reality and it turns out I got him boots and he loves the boots of course like of course because he's a child and I make decisions for my child because I'm not a child and then they send babies into rooms and the boys play with trucks and the girls play with dolls I mean that it's not really rhesus monkeys by the way they've done studies rhesus monkeys gender by by toy yeah like it's just that this whole thing is absurd probably always locusts I'm the female gender roles and how this affects women's happiness same is true of men the same is exactly true they don't focus on that because it's not politically expedient but when men are doing things that men naturally want to do they are better at it they are happier and when they try to do more nurturing things I unfortunately what what do you guys think because I think that I love the movie but I think it's actually quite a damaging movie what do you think of Unforgiven I like um because I love it I mean it's a great movie but the good guy in that movie is Gene Hackman there's an easy read to that movie where gene Hackman's the video yeah really but he's a he's the he's trying to keep order in the town he's the guy who says I'm not gonna execute somebody for what is a non-executable crime mmm right he's the one who's I mean he spends the entire film building his house right that's it supposed to be metaphorical right and then here comes this guy in from the plane she's basically a career criminal and killer who comes and shoots him to death because life is meaningless well it is it is a postmodern commentary on the Western there's no question in that line in that where he he says the gene Hackman says I don't deserve this he says dessert has nothing to do with it deserving has nothing to do with it that is that is the world that he is showing you he's showing you a nihilistic world in which these guys are building the order which is this basically the story of the Western yeah but it's the counter story of the West recount what is the real truth of what America was this is why I love Western so much I think is why conservatives love Western so much it's not just like guns and hats and tombstone you haven't told us your favorite Western keep AME look if you if I had one to take to a desert island I would probably have to take tombstone just because it's so remote this soup there's there's there's no point where you can't like you could turn into that movie in virtually any point and you will spend the night it's a black hole movie in Oakland it is it is spectacular and Val Kilmer is just great and every line is called about and that's and that scene where that that scene where Kurt Russell makes it like smacks around Billy Bob thorn Billy Bob thorn before it got skinny he says we just stand there and bleed we shouldn't look over the Spaghetti Westerns I mean you Clint Eastwood is the last great movie star yeah I think those are good westerns yeah and they know and Deadwood was was at its greatest moments it was great dead the first season of Deadwood isn't quite good and then that you know what the for me you know the first five episodes are good and then once they kill spoiler alert 15 years here we go but once it was once they kill Wild Bill Wow no balls killed you know to me it was a it's a hit and miss show but like every fourth episode is some one of the best TV episodes ever but it is like the guy when I read that book difficult men about the people people have created this thing he was he was this kind of wild man the guy who created it and he was show up on set and he would have a great idea and then he disappeared have a bad idea and the show plays like that every now and again you'll be sitting there and go like moments of characters it has some of the best acting in almost every role like guys will come on into three episodes and you can't believe the performance again but I think that the the reason the Western can cannot survive in this environment at least not the way that it was traditionally made is because the Western requires strong men and strong women and we can this is really the thing it's not it's not that the Western requires weak women and strong men it requires strong women and strong yet yeah and you cannot have strong men in movies anymore the only strong that this is what you know drew you've been asking for a while why are people into superhero movies the only strong men who are allowed are aliens or people who are actually strong because they have superpowers yeah like just a traditional strong male character will be destroyed by the critics for virtually any reason when's the last time you saw a movie with a traditional strong male who's not an antihero who's just a strong male of doing something the Bradley Cooper movie American sniper American sniper right and one of the critics do it they brushed it right critics it the critics decided that this thing was was terrible and patriarchal but all that goes together but there is not something well there is something else about the Western that I think is a non malign reason for its kind of fading from the scene which is that at some point in the history of my life right at some point the focus of art of especially popular or turned from the past to the future it used to be that all heroes were fighting the Nazis in westerns it was America's past this is what where we came from but there is this moment that happens especially with computers where everything is modernizing so fast that really people are thinking about what happens next in the seventies right it was right around like in the spaghetti western I don't think we're fighting the future even future movies are about fighting the present I think that the the reality of it is that the Western exists in a world where classical virtues masculine virtues still deserve to be defended and championed and because and I think we can all take a little bit of you know our tribes have our it is that religious people in particular Christians in this country over the last I don't know 25 to 50 years started this view of men and started this view of sin as masculine behaviour Christians did okay and they actually led us down a bad path as a society they started to say you know being a good Christian is being quiet in church not fidgeting with your with the flyer not staring at your shoes being women became teen you know in public schools women disproportionately our teachers over men and they started taking these sort of this view of male behavior as needing to be disciplined or even medicated out of existence and it's it's not that masculinity became worse masculinity if anything probably became better with time but it's just that women became the standard bearer the the standard setters for what they're going to accept and they didn't want to accept in either a religious setting or in a public setting masculine behaviors you know there's that story you all covered it the story of the woman the 70 year old professor who told her husband that she yes the more interesting part of that story to me is something that she says you know that wasn't Ana raised in a raised voice and she she said not in the entire history of the feminist movement have men self-selected into a group to defeat the teasing and the bullying behaviors of men and I thought right I don't agree with you that they're bad look I don't agree and other people have made good points like yes we do it's called father's yes we do this call does it but there's an even bigger point which I don't agree that teasing some men talk to each other that's how men talk to each other I don't agree that every form of bullying is equal I don't agree that that men toughen each other up yeah and I don't agree that that is in every instance a negative but because it isn't feminine right it's not a value held by women and because the church ceded its responsibility and then parents ceded their responsibility to the state and these female virtues became the only virtues now she actually can't believe that men aren't trying to destroy men you know I think I think there is something though about this and this goes back to the Western as civilization advances it does become more feminine and there was a famous line I don't remember who said it about England at its really as it was rising to its peak after the Napoleonic war somebody said England is heaven paradise for women purgatory for Men and he'll on the horses and I think that I think that there's something about that statement that is generally true of great civilizations that they do become restrictive for men because you do not go out anymore you do call the police at some point this is still I mean you need to translate masculinity into a civilized form at that point but I will say that I think that what you're saying has a lot of Merit in the sense that great civilizations once they reached their peak are about protection of the civilization it's not venturing forth and doing new things and what the Western really is at root even beyond male and female stuff is about the idea that you have people who are leaving behind safety and security and venturing into places that they've never been before where there's a pretty high likelihood of sickness and or death yeah and they're doing it specifically to better themselves and their family yeah and that that is a uniquely American thing it's why the Western is uniquely American art form and it's also why I'm not sure that I actually don't buy the we now focus in the movies on the future as much I think that because Star Trek is a Western know the original Star Trek is Western then that's what I mean I mean the originals the original Star Trek is James Kirk being a cowboy going out to venturing forth and discovering new and undiscovered territories right and impregnating the locals that was in that that was that was what Star Trek was it was Western and then new next-generation which is not a Western it's not a Western because now it's about policing of the universe and it's all about well we we have this principle we can't get involved with anything that's happening in the world and this is why when george w bush was trying to do what he was doing in iraq it was he was a cowboy and he was the cowboy to him an epithet as opposed to a compliment they did the same thing with ronald reagan you Cowboys were bad because Cowboys were people who ventured forth across the horizon in search of new things to conquer and I think we've lost the cowboy mentality we were talking about this in terms of economics and work because one of the great debates right now is sort of what do you do about the fact that the economy is bifurcating in terms of sort of more intellectually driven jobs and less intellectually driven jobs and maybe technology is killing some of the lower earning jobs again I I don't see total evidence of this there are seven million unfilled jobs in America right now an environment does not exist but there is this baseline assumption by both left and right by populous from Bernie Sanders on the left to Donald Trump on the right and I think Tucker Carlson too and on the Left Bernie and Elizabeth Warren and it's a common view now held across the political spectrum and that is that if you are in a town that is basically dying off because of globalization the factories have left and half the population is now on opiates that we have to find a way to restore your town to its former glory and it's not just it's people like Orrin castrate or ins a real intellectual and I you know I have a lot of respect for all the people who I mentioned on the right and none for the people I'm alive but with that said this idea that that town must be restored that is that's actually an tide the Western no idea right absolutely idea what the idea of all of America was built on this notion that sure I have this little plot of land or I have this crappy house in the middle of East London but you know what I'm out of here this place sucks we are crossing an ocean going into a place where I will likely be killed and then I'm gonna establish something there and then I'm gonna cross the Appalachians and I'm gonna go do it across this giant vast plain where there is no water I'm just gonna go across that entire place yeah I'm gonna go settle in the middle of nowhere where there's nobody there and where my town consists of me and three of my friends and we're gonna establish a civilization there and this this idea that all worlds have been conquered right there's there's no place left to explore there's no place left to discover for each that may be true for us as a civilization because we now can map where everything is it is not true for any individual on planet earth and you know there's a famous book written in the 60s I think a work of literary criticism called the virgin land which starts to chart out the effect of running out of wilderness and this is why for decades I have been a big supporter of going back into space because I think that we the human race has always always live by expansion and it's going to continue to live by expansion I do not believe that story is over I believe this space is the next frontier that great the point that I'm making is that maybe as a civilization we need to go to space just to keep that kind of bone in our body but as an individual you can be a cowboy just by picking up from your little town and moving through town in North Dakota and getting a fracking job you know penniless now they do they move a lot more of your working people our people are moving the mobility has actually gone down in recent years which is a shocking thing because the availability of mobility is of course higher than it has ever been in human history and we act as though it's a rough thing to get in a car and drive for hours to a town and get an apartment there when it used to cost you a year of your life and all of your assets to move across 300 miles and you you have you have businesses coming into towns and saying we're hiring but you have to pass a drug test and the room empties out yeah right you know I mean we have a we have serious serious problems it's a mentality it is a spiritual it is a spiritual ways that we are where we are in the middle of a spiritual malaise and it's a malaise that is that has a bunch of causes but if you think that it's gonna be cured by politics or by handing somebody a job it is not gonna be cleared by any of that stuff I watched a news show last night I don't actually know what networks carrying it because I watched it on on iTunes but it might be someone like discovery and it's called Mars and the show is 50% pretty decently acted very well produced fiction about the first human mission to Mars in 2033 the other half of the show is documentary taking place right now tracking Elon Musk trying to real and reusable rockets it's a really peculiar approach so sure I've never seen anyone quite do it but one of them one of my concerns about looking to space as the next frontier for conservatism because conservatism always lives at the frontier it's easy to think that maybe those values extend into space but I think we think we miss the reality of how hostile the environment of space is so a lot of our space requires government in a way that the real world doesn't a lot of the things that the left tries to convince you you need here and we know you don't you actually do need up there and conservatives are pretending that you don't so for example can you have a second amendment on a lunar base well of course not you can't even have a barbeque grill on a lunar base if you start a small fire you you kill all life on the moon like on the totality of the moon yeah a small grease fire wipes all of it out because you can't so much as open a window you can't so much as open a door yeah you there you are you live completely at the mercy of what's been constructed so I I wondered to do our values actually make it to the new oh oh I think they would first of all you know we cannot imagine what's gonna happen next that this is you know I was talking to a nanotechnologist just the other day and when I when I got out of college I went out of town yeah right when I got out of college which we're talking about 1722 right I got out of college I had two science-fiction ideas one was they would inject machines into us that would heal diseases this guy says that's what they're doing now that is what they're experimenting with now the other science fiction idea I had was a way of tricking planets into thinking they had more gravity than they do so that you could terraform them I don't think the world is gonna look like domes on Mars I don't think it's gonna look like machinery like battery operated air domes I think that we're going to actually terraform planets I think amazing stuff is going to happen I think you did you see the expanse I started it's really good I'm innocent it's her the premise of it and I think that I think that these values are values the thing conservatism is adventurous it's by nature adventurous and leftism is by nature conservancy what is in America conservatism is about adventure searching for when there's a great adventure for how we're gonna terraform Mars which is that we're gonna go to those pole you know we're all that under-underground eyes yes we're gonna nuke it like 1,000 nuclear bombs that is as it gets and then you don't need the domes no it's actually Trevor actually I do I do fear that in our attempts to make life more comfortable for a lot of folks we are actually sucking the spirit out of out of young people there was a great a great op-ed by Phil Gramm and whoever writes his op ads with him I can't remember the other guy's name about how redistribution had done wonderful things to cure actual poverty in America and at the same time it had done that it had created a dependence culture and I think that that is a wonderful puzzle that conservatives are going to have to solve because people will always go with the easy thing I mean this is the this is you and I have always talked about this is the message of Exodus basically you know it's like you God comes and takes the people out of slavery and they're in the desert for two minutes and they're like why did you take us out of slavery we had food there you know people don't want to be free they want to eat they want to have stuff and so this is what we are going to have to solve and I do it it gets solved by adventure but I I think that the other way that it gets solved honestly is by two of my favorite things guilt and shame one of the things that we've done is it's not just that we've made life easier and given people access to resources they wouldn't otherwise had we've made people feel that they are entitled to these resources got to do it not otherwise we were talking about this earlier with regard to with regards in Louise Cinderella Man where there's a boxer who before he's champion is living in absolute poverty and he's he's on the welfare dole and when he becomes champion he walks back in with a roll a wad of cash he walks back into the welfare office and he plops it back on the table he says okay well I'm paying you back now so you don't have to sir and he says well I do Yeah right is there a person a human being in America know who it not one not one human right left for Center who would do that now Harry Truman declared bankruptcy in his young life and when he became successful later in life went back and paid off the Predators the number of people who would do that sort of thing today is 0 because we have told people that they deserve everything that they have and more even even welfare workers I've talked to me talked about what they call welfare psychosis this is a term invented by welfare people who work for the welfare system they call it welfare psychosis which is people begin to get angry that they're not where's my money where's my money and they don't realize it's not your money that somebody else's money they were afraid adapt verb for it in Sweden because the the situation in in Sweden is so bad with with the crushing of the work ethic that people are legitimately staying home rather than go to work and they've created like an actual verb that's based on the name of the agency that pays the money and slips my mind right now but it's so it's it's a really serious issue and that this is why I think you're seeing this upsurge in interest in people like Jordan Peterson cuz what Jordan really is doing what Jordans big thing is when you put aside all the mythology and all of the kind of the intellectual stuff what Jordan really is doing is he's saying to young men particularly that you have to go out an adventure right he's saying go out and cultivate that's that's really his main message his message is go out and cultivate young men are hungry for this message and the left is getting them the message that you cannot succeed no matter what you do that the world is stacked against you that's an uninspiring boring message and so it's the left wants to talk about government programs all day and if we talk about government programs the left will win all day because the government left will always outcomes a program that's a really good it's really but it's it but if we what we have to start talking about is what you can do on your own in a free society yeah it's gonna be better for you and better for society then anything government can possibly do for you if you toughen up if you strengthen up this is this hump is a good thing and it's a good pitch it actually is a good this is the thing that makes me so sad sometimes when I go to colleges and I talk to people and I'll talk to a 19 year old guy who's you know because now the new generation is so much taller than we are right so you're talking about up there you're looking at he's six foot four he's ripped he's a gym rat he looks and he's talking about microaggression you say dude a microaggression first of all micro means it's so small your tool you should be your cowboy boot should be crushing that thing under you as you go on to build whatever it is you were made to build and that's that is a sad sad we lost our swagger when you can talk a man when you can talk a man into worrying I'm not even speaking for women we even talk a man into worrying about a microaggression you have taken away his man this is why I think that you know you remember in 20 Obama's campaign slogan was was yes we can write the stuff and the and the fact is that the American message was never really yes we can it was always yes you can you can go out and you said you can succeed and that was the biblical message too I mean it literally is the first command given to Abraham is get up from your home go to a place that I will show you you're not gonna know what the hell's going on you're gonna not gonna know what and the first thing that happens when it gets to the Land of Israel is there's a giant famine and he has to travel away from all right so this is this idea that you that you are guaranteed they that you're guaranteed a certain level of security or you should be guaranteed a level of security what you are guaranteed is an adventure when you're born you're guaranteed an adventure and it is a choose-your-own-adventure you get to determine which direction this adventure is gonna go and that can be really scary it can also be deeply inspiring which is why again you know I think that the the ideals of the Western if you were to pick one era of American manhood that matters and you were to say I will this is my image of America like we we all have the same images of America from Iwo Jima and our soldiers and all that but the image of the American the image of the American to me is still a cowboy on horseback who's wandering off into the the unexplored vistas trying to bring civilization to a place that doesn't have it yeah and that's and what's what the hell's wrong with that why isn't that a great pitch why isn't that a pitch we can make to people are we just so secure and we're so attached to the comfort food and so attached to our things and so attached to not moving anywhere well I think I think historically what happened and it's a good thing and it speaks so well of our country that there was a coming to conscience about how we had treated black people in this one not last and and there was a uprising of shame and uprising of self awareness and we said now this has got to change and that was a moment where the left got in a lot of good stuff and so they won't let it die and the thing is it's gone you could you can live your entire life and never face racism except in a personal way you might meet a racist you might meet somebody who hates you know so what you know I it's I mean anti-semites on a fairly regular basis you know I mean people who hate me all that know you know I had a conversation with the only mentor I've ever had in life where I said to him you know I never really came up against any anti-semitism in my life until I was older met a couple of Anthony I never really meant and he said well didn't didn't you come across the wasp who looked down on you and I cracked up and I said if I did I wouldn't have noticed I would not have noticed some clown looking down at me the left said we need to extend the opportunities of America and the wealth of America and the benefits of America to wider and wider groups and that's true but what they didn't say is we need to extend the adventure of America to these groups rather than that adventure they because they were deprived of that adventure we're not going to grant that opportunity to adventure instead we are going to grant just the benefits I'm going to grant the opportunity to adventure to some of our actual subscribers yes Alicia yeah that a remark that Ben had about Star Trek is very applicable to some of our subscribers and if you're wondering oh how do I ask the god-king and all the guys over there some questions don't forget that you can head over to daily wire.com to subscribe and ask your questions in our chat box Evan wants to know to the god-king with conservatives being based in logic and liberals based on emotion are we going to have the same results of that Vulcan Romulan war it's chump our own serac and if logic does win do we make leftists go through the the Cullen R am I saying that right sorry I'm not a Trekkie more of a Star Wars fan or do they get their own planet you have taken them to a level of not that I can't go it really it touches on a real piece of disappointment for me which is that they never actually circled back and figured out if that Romulan chick was Tasha Yar like they they dealt with a little bit like maybe as Tasha Yar daughter it's like they set up the biggest question in the entire next generation then I just let it go oh yeah nobody cares about that we care and beyond that I'm not going to answer that question what's one thing the one thing about Star Trek that I know yeah it is really important you know there's based on the Hornblower novels yeah if you haven't read the Hornblower novels are the greatest adventure novels ever really not never oh my god you would okay if you start reading the Hornblower novels we won't see you again you will be like whatever bin you love them to death they're so great oh you've made me a bunch of fiction recommendation that's 48 hours I bought some of the parties I would also second that there are really great books and I think that you can get them on your Kindle for free because of the way that copyright laws work they're so old that you don't even have to pay for them anymore so check that out Ben so some of andrew Clavin is early harsh ouch this question comes from subscriber james who wants know been assuming trump keeps on this similar trajectory to his first two years are you planning to vote for trump in 2020 yeah be heard not to vote for him if he continues on a similar trajectory and I've said this I've said this before my I had three chief concerns with President Trump when he was candidate Trump one is that who'd not govern conservative because he had said a bunch of crap all over the place there was no guarantee of where he was gonna be that has been alleviated he's governed extraordinarily conservatively problem number two I had with him is that he was going to sole suck the Republican Party and drive them to embrace positions and ideas that I found abominable some of that has happened but it's already happened and it's not gonna be alleviated again by me not voting for him because what's happened has happened and now we're already there so it's a little bit like okay now that now the car is in the river now what do you do right it's not the same thing and in fairness that has been far less of the year s first war for sure so I was worried that the entire party was suddenly going to embrace tariffs and the entire party was going to suddenly embrace the idea of being soft on Russia or and like take the worst aspects of his rhetoric and then apply those broadly and I don't think that that's been the case among most Republicans in fact I think most Republicans correctly see Trump as more of a vehicle for Policy Priorities than as a thought leader which makes sense cuz thought leaders need to have thoughts so that always meant like really especially polls and young people show that this is not how young people think so that's been alleviated and then concern number three is the one that's still very much on the table and that is the toxification of the Republican brand by President Trump with growing demographic groups in the United States it's obviously true with women it's not quite as obviously true with black folks and Hispanics so yeah well it it might be all but the evidence there is kinda skimpy but at the very least it's not really the as a deepening damage that already existed with those groups maybe maybe not with women it certainly isn't with young women with young people young people do not like President Trump I mean this is just a fact like millennial generation folks are not fans of President Trump every poll of Millennials ever shows that Trump runs very very poorly among Millennials again the question is is the damage already done and the answer there is kind of yes I mean he's president of the United States if I withhold my vote I don't understand how that's actually changing that especially when I'm standing out here critiquing all the same stuff that other Millennials are critiquing right I'm sitting here saying it's actually bad when he says that women are horror spaces it's kind of bad when guys do porn stars while they're married it's gross and yucky and I've said before he treats women like garbage because he does treat women like garbage like we all know this this is not a big shock but is any of that so the calculus has changed I'm always happy to change my actions based on the evidence that has changed and several pieces of evidence changes governance has changed and there's a difference between him being a candidate in doing stuff and being president and that stuff now being set in stone and the ground itself has changed the ground itself has shifted so I'd be surprised he has to do some some more egregious stuff for me to consider not voting for him and Justin twisted let's hear your question what do you do once the car is in the water you go home and change your clothes to establish an alibi this question comes from Zachary he wants to know Michael he's seriously considering converting to Catholicism and he's currently a Southern Baptist it sounds like he probably wants to dance and drink that's why he's good that was going to be my pitch that way out loud voice sorry he said that he's currently Southern Baptist and he has a lot of gotten a lot of pushback from his family do you have any advice about how he should deal with this well you can only believe what you believe you can't I don't think that you can you should do it just for the booze and the cigar you know Chesterton said the Catholic Church is a thick steak a glass of red wine in a good cigar which I was already there I hadn't clearly through that I was Inquisition now so you can only do what you believe it you can I don't think that you should join a church for social aspects and I don't think you should stay in a church because your family wants you to stay in that church you have to believe what you believe obviously I'm Catholic I am with the Catholic Church I believe in Catholic theology absolutely how you doin Pope Francis there I well you know to you know to demonstrate when the Pope is fallible so I think you should do that you know I've I've read a lot of different theologian theologians Protestants evangelical theologians like a lot of Catholics I fell down on the Catholic side I think you should follow that the one recommendation I will make if if you do want to become a Catholic is because the Catholic Church has been around forever you know for 2,000 years they have a resource called Catholic Answers and they answer like every single question you could pi I mean they say what should I have for breakfast on Tuesday morning it will be there and I encourage you to do it you know you know what side that I fell down on but I wouldn't I wouldn't just do it for a social reason and I wouldn't stay in a church for a social no Jeremy why shouldn't this person become a cab because he'll burn them at the stake I think is it well the religion of the god-king yeah why why should they not become a Catholic yeah this is the Jew I like I I largely agree with what Michael just said but especially the part about you have to believe what you believe a person can't I don't believe in converting exactly because I don't really believe in religious institutionalism that's why I'm not Catholic right you know I I think God doesn't exist within an institution I don't think that God created in a Christian institution I think that part of the the moving from the Old Testament to the New Testament is sort of that God creates an institution to teach me and something about himself in the Old Testament and then he frees him from that institution to teach man something about God in the New Testament that that divide to me is one that that the Catholic Church has missed the porch says it's the institution yeah yeah right for that reason though I would not tell someone who believes in Catholicism that they should you know there's a there's a line in the New Testament that says that's equal right there there's a concept in the New Testament though that someone can't live according to your view of freedom your view of gospel freedom that to to cause someone else to do so would be to cause them to stumble that you're supposed to favor the weaker brother and it's it it doesn't mean it in in terms of physical strength it's a it's a theological concept like you you may believe that you have freedom from certain legal restrictions you may want other people to participate in that freedom but the worst thing that you can do is set a an example a behavioral example that causes them to act against their own religious conviction or against their own conscience to sort of satisfy your view of freedom when they don't personally have it because then you're you haven't freed them from anything you've just caused them to move into what they view is sin you know what you because they betray yeah exactly so to that end I would think that if a person identifies with Catholic theology I'd have fun arguing the theological points with them but I wouldn't want them to give some sort of weird lip service to my beliefs or to come to my church or said to act outside of their own view of what God requires requires of them so yeah I don't disagree on on the broad way ya know I'm with you a hundred percent I'm a bit like Jesus guy I gotta say the more I read the Gospels the more I find the most complex subtle Fiat moral theology the most complex thinking is right there and if whatever gets you to Jesus I'm for you know if it's a Catholic Church if it's a stiff account you know it doesn't matter to me yeah but if you want a better answer about why a person shouldn't be Catholics cuz I don't want them to go to hell oh wow well I think that's the only time I've seen been said over there twiddle histone Nick wants to know what any of you guys support a primary challenge of President Trump in 2020 nope not now no not in not sitting here in October of 2018 mm-hmm the problem with questions like this is I think is that they require us to put ourselves into a future that doesn't yeah yeah right if there's a tape of him like whipping a black guy while shouting the other work then yes right I mean this new book is the art of mind complex right there are situations that really if you if you were caught on tape saying the n-word in like the way that race SAT like if we were Hillary Clinton's mentor senator Burke yeah I mean but is here's been my view of the primary effort this is really since like literally the day of the election because he'd won and because the party mobilized behind him you are actually doing especially if it's a primary challenge from the right you're doing the party in actual disservice you're doing conservatives an actual disservice by running against him because now you are pitting people's loyalty to a sitting president who won against Hillary Clinton and who has been governing in a conservative fashion against their ideal version of conservatism and that version is going to then be alienated from the party so what's it the f somebody like Ben Sasse who really can't stand president Trump and let's say that he were to run a primary effort I would oppose that primary effort even though I agree with Ben Sasse more than I tend to agree and President Trump specifically because I think that what will end up happening is you'll end up fringing out the view that I hold true to that's right like there is such a thing as pick your battles there is such a thing as real pose yeah I mean well you have to be strategic and how you choose to approach the wooing of people to a particular ideology or the alienation of people from a particular ideology which is why I've actually I really have made a serious effort in the past several years particularly not actually attacking other people on the right like I really try hard not to other people on the right even though obviously you know we become pretty high-profile and I'm in conflict with them a lot of the time I do I really really like that I I can't think Reagan was right aside from the alt-right who are just execrable human but there's nothing but there and they're not the right right yeah the key word there's old right aside from like actual racists in actual sexist and actual bigots like I hard pressed to find tape of me not critiquing critiquing I'll do but actually attacking somebody on our quote-unquote side of the aisle especially when it comes to differences over president Trump's clarifying they have really terrified this situation a better question would be would you vote for Trump right now because then we can actually use the facts that we have available to us right answer that one earlier Alicia we still got some more questions coming in from our awesome daily wire subscribers who are asking of course because their daily wire subscribers and they're going to daily wire calm and putting these questions at the chat box the Knost and I are pulling them for you guys yay we have a question from a lady named Claire she says out of potential candidates for the Democratic Party who do you think would be the worst for this country oh my who's anyone so there's so many so much to choose from or Liz I spoiled for choice I mean I I do think I I do think any of them have now certainly people like Elizabeth Warren have been so radicalized what they were actually talking about and so bad and so anti-american and you know I hate to use that phrase because that was in the old days that was what the right would fling at anybody who didn't you know who had any kind of liberal it lysing ideas at all but they have actually become anti-american if the American idea is to preserve the individual rights the life liberty and the pursuit of happiness they are no longer on that page they have devop you know I was just reading it you know in psychology the idea of the individual is the rare idea it is in most societies it is groupthink that is what the left but it is hilarious that they call themselves progressive when they are regressing from the one original idea people have had about politics and just about all of them now ascribe to that you know although I will say I think that Kamala Harris is more dangerous than before why and the reason that I say that is because Elizabeth Warren obviously cannot play the identity politics card in this issue here come I think one of the things that honestly the worst thing about President Obama was not even his governance was just piss-poor it was it was the fact that he pitted ethnic groups against one another for political purposes and Warren can't credibly do that Bernie Sanders can't credibly do that they can they can pursue bad economic policy which is fixable because bad economic policy tends to be somewhat self-correcting in the sense that it collapses and then you get Reagan right but what but what cannot be fixed is the continuing racial and ethnic divide based on identity politics that is being promulgated by certain wing of the Democratic Party and that's being led by Cory Booker and Kamala Harris in that Party and Harris I agree with you Harris is the bigger danger because Booker is so cynical but you remember in 2012 he was defending Mitt Romney he was defending Wall Street he was the moderate guy then he realized his only path was to pivot and become hysterical spartacus what's amazing is that he actually of all the candidates he's the most like Hillary Clinton he's so much that's exactly you can actually see the gears to every step of the way yeah and that's what makes him so amusing is what like he's the only person who would say out loud this is my Spartacus just reading from the teleprompter in the stage direction cory booker exit stage right but it's yeah I think that Harris is the most dangerous person to be president not sure that she's most dangerous candidate to be trying to come back I think I think that Trump clearly yeah because I think that she is off-putting yeah and I think that she is strident in a way that even Warren is not yeah I think that I think that the most dangerous candidate to beat Trump I thought was Warren until she did what you did this week like really I thought that she was is because because I thought that I thought no no there's no such thing as over I mean John Kerry's talking about let's not forget that it approximately this point in 2014 Donald Trump was looking for a birth certificate yeah but I will say that I had more I had a higher opinion of her political acumen well a week and a half ago than I do now yeah and so I figured okay she's smart and she knows what she's doing and now she's proved that she's smart but she certainly does not know what she's doing what do you think of this baito phenomenon that's going on in tech no I think I think he's I think they will find somebody who is like a beta but I think once bado loses to Cruz he loses that lustre I think it's right they will find but they will find somebody else to glom on to as the new fresh-faced also again Beto's masquerading as a Hispanic with this bado nonsense right so at a certain point it was gonna come out that he's again whiter than then he's all just napkin who's masquerading as a fresh face he's been in Congress for a long time I mean it's not right they're a bunch of people that they're gonna try and hold this up for they didn't try to do for hooli in Castro yes my and is that he doesn't fill a hole for them the same way that Obama really filled the hole for Democrats in 2007-2008 yeah but young fresh face you would be the best Democrat for the country of the people who are currently circling avenatti cuz he's impossible because he's a clown and so the the reactions would be able to do it I mean if one of them if one of them could achieve the office which one's the best for the country um or is that what you're saying book Booker I think right because he's the goofiest and the most cynical and no no but you're saying you're saying if you looked at that platforms and their ideas who would be and they could actually achieve those platform but which plan I mean make these things and I think I think there's a case to be made for Biden I think there's a good case provider there's a there's a case to be made because at least Biden still has sort of a pathological attachment to the country yeah and he does have a certain warmth for the Rust Belt and people working in factories in Ohio and and he doesn't he doesn't actually want to divide the cut he will cynically to by the country for political purposes what he does because he's a cynic and he's a plagiarist he's bad person who gives a hell of a back rub I like amigo sakes Trump look really smart yeah if some plugs like an intellectual we have time for one more question from one of our delightful daily wire subscribers who is probably the proud owner of a leftist here's hydro cool tumblr oh yeah and they need to apparently get a steven crowder mug because he wants to get into cigars and Dylan wants to know if you guys have any suggestions or tips on what he should get or how he should even begin this has got to be in those questions that's you know I would say one graduation somebody finally wants to finally real expertise I would never suggest violating the law you know they say that those cigars from Cuba are pretty good so I don't know who knows if those are any good there are plenty of good cigars though to get that you can get in the United States I legally a really good cigars you know there was a cigar boom in the 1990s and that's good clean there was a big cigar boom in the 90s you can there are a zillion great factories in Nicaragua Dominican Republic now even some in Florida and it's because when the Cubans communists came in and stole everybody's property ripped you know kicked people out they all went to the Dominican Republic they went to Nicaragua they went to Florida and there's some cool stuff even coming out of LA Nicaragua I mean you can get some really great smokes for 10 bucks some even last some $15 so I recommend sampling anything by this is like real inside baseball do Deion does a great work my father makes great cigars Oliva tattwa hey Pete Johnson out here all good stuff and if you want to smoke that communist trash can be pretty good Dennis Prager for that question yes thanks for watching some of us may feel that we're actually have the imaginative experience that we've been smoking a Cuban cigar really is there a way to get them legal yes we went down to to Cuba we took a little trip when it was impossible to do that now it's a little harder to do that is Obama thanks Obama that's the only time I've said thanks Obama it's you can it now you can it's very complicated talk about our this is actually a good point on our government violating its own laws all the time there is an embargo on products from Cuba you're not supposed to go there spend money the executive branch just changes the rules all the time and it has for decades yeah so now it used to be the case if you were on the streets of Europe and you were smoking a Cuban a diplomat could gun you down arrest you you know you were you could accidentally died during an interrogation you but you can if you travel abroad you know you got a suitcase you can smoke Cuban cigars there and you know it's pretty nice you might accidentally you might accidentally look our country was a history of cigars in history of this country are intertwined it's true Columbus made it here he saw the native smoking cigars it was one of the great gifts to humanity and every King died of mouth cancer after that that's right hopes did it yeah the nasal cavities astroid absolutely yeah it was this wasn't good enough PSA for tobacco cuban bubbles all right we want to say thank you to alicia for bringing us those delightful questions from our subscribers thank you to the subscribers themselves you are the reason that we are here even even Michael Knowles received some because of the good work of our of our subscribers we try thank you to you guys for
