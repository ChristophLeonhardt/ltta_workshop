FIREWORKS DURING THE QUESTION OF

FRUSTRATIONS WITH HIS HANDLING

7
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:28,809
OF THE PROBE.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,278
>> YOU WROTE THE MEMO SAYING

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,114
COMEY SHOULD BE FIRED AND SIGNED

THE FISA EXTENSION FOR CARTER

11
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:39,754
RESCUED MORE SO THAN JEFF

12
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:41,222
SESSIONS BECAUSE YOU MADE

13
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:42,490
DECISIONS AFFECTING BOTH PRONGS

14
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:43,124
OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,425
WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT?

16
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:47,728
>> I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WERE IT

17
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,463
APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO RECUSE, I

18
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:50,664
WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY.

IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THIS

24
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:02,510
PRESIDENT ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY,

25
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:05,446
WHATEVER YOU GOT.

26
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,648
FINISH THE HELL UP!

27
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:11,919
THIS COUNTRY IS BEING TORN

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,219
APART.

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,255
>> THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS

FINISH IT APPROPRIATELY DOES

00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:16,357
REACH A CONCLUSION.

32
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:22,363
EVIDENCE.

33
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:24,165
>> DID YOU READ THE FISA

00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,266
APPLICATION BEFORE YOU SIGNED?

35
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,967
>> I WON'T COMMENT.

36
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,636
>> WHY ARE YOU KEEPING

37
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:29,703
INFORMATION FROM CONGRESS?

38
00:01:29,704 --> 00:01:32,273
>> I AM NOT KEEPING ANY

39
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:35,176
INFORMATION FROM CONGRESS THAT

40
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:36,143
IS APPROPRIATE.

41
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:39,547
>> YOU ARE THE BOSS,

42
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:40,548
MR. ROSENSTEIN.

43
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:41,515
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

44
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:44,185
MY JOB IT IS TO RESPOND TO YOUR

45
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:44,552

46
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:45,786
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS.

47
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:47,188
>> I THINK THE HOUSE OF

48
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:47,922
REPRESENTATIVES WILL SAY

49
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:48,289
OTHERWISE.

50
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,193
>> YOU ARE USING THIS TO ATTACK

51
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:56,730
ACT TINGED.

52
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,532
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WON'T GIVE

53
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,367
US WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

54
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:01,569
>> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE.

55
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,103
>> IT IS ACCURATE.

56
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:06,540
WE HAVE CAUGHT YOU HIDING

57
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:06,941
INFORMATION.

58
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:07,842
>> Laura: ANYONE ELSE GET

JORDAN'S QUESTIONING WHEN YOU

68
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,134
FOUND TO BE BADGERING.

69
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:37,404
I WAS WATCHING AT MY RADIO

70
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:37,738
STUDIO.

71
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,541
I WINSED.

72
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,342
WHEN YOU HAVE TO INTERRUPT

73
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:43,444
A WITNESS IT MAKES YOUR CASE NOT

74
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:45,246
LOOK THAT STRONG.

75
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:46,514
LET HIM HAVE THE ANSWER.

76
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,349
I THINK HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT NOT

77
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,951
HAVING ENOUGH TIME.

78
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,424
PART OF JORDAN?

79
00:02:57,425 --> 00:03:00,995
>> IT WASN'T A FATAL MISTAKE.

80
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:04,565
HE WENT TO THE TEDDY KENNEDY

81
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:05,966
SCHOOL OF CROSS-EXAMINATION.

82
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,435
YOU ASK A HOSTILE QUESTION AND

83
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:10,137
INTERRUPT THE PERSON YOU ARE

84
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:10,538
QUESTIONING.

85
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:12,540
MY OBJECTION IS NOT TO THE

86
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,353
BASHING ROSENSTEIN IS SOMETHING

87
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,756
ANDY SPOKE TO SEVERAL TIMES IN

88
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:35,162
AGO.

89
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:36,864
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THE ABSOLUTE

90
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:38,899
AUTHORITY TO ORDER ROD

91
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,567
ROSENSTEIN TO TURN OVER

92
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:40,701
EVERYTHING TO THE CONGRESS.

93
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:42,570
IF HE DIDN'T, AND ROSENSTEIN

94
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:45,272
DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, HE COULD

95
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:47,408
RESIGN OR IF HE REFUSED, THE

96
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,509
PRESIDENT COULD FIRE HIM.

97
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,911
WHY HASN'T HE DONE THAT?

98
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,479
>> Laura: LET'S ASK ANDY.

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,915
WHAT IS THE DELAY?

100
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:05,726
WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT SAY

101
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,294
TOROSE ROSE ENOUGH OF THESE

102
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:09,597
CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE

103
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,835
WE ARE COMPELLING YOU TO RELEASE

104
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:15,302
THE DOCUMENTS.

105
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:17,104
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RELEASE

106
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:17,805
THE DOCUMENTS.

107
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:18,805
THAT WAS CLEAR TODAY.

108
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:21,508
WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT DEMAND

109
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:22,810
THEY BE RELEASED AND GET THIS

110
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,845
SHOW ON THE ROAD?

111
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:27,781
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION,

112
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:33,887
THE GREAT IRONY OF THE HEARING

113
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,689
WAS MY FRIEND JIM JORDAN LAYING

114
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,157
INTO ROD ROSENSTEIN SAYING YOU

115
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:38,292
ARE THE BOSS.

116
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,260
THESE PEOPLE WORK FOR YOU.

117
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:44,898
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS THAT

118
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,934
ROSENSTEIN WORKS FOR TRUMP.

119
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:48,969
PRECISELY THE POINT YOU MAKE IS

120
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,770
TRUE.

121
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,106
TRUMP CAN ORDER THIS.

122
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:55,175
WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT HE

123
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:55,776
GOTTEN ADVICE.

124
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:58,646
I DON'T THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY

125
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:00,581
GOOD ADVICE.

126
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:03,484
BECAUSE HAS BEEN UNDER

127
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,219
INVESTIGATION FOR OBSTRUCTION

128
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,991
AND BECAUSE THE CRITICS OF TRUMP

129
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:14,428
CONFLATED IN THE PUBLIC MIND THE

130
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:18,265
REPUBLICAN PERSUIT OF AGENTS

131
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,435
AND MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION.

132
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:24,505
IF TRUMP ACT TO FORCE DISCLOSURE

133
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,973
AND HELP CONGRESS HE IS

134
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:27,641
OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE.

135
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:28,909
I THINK THAT'S NUTS.

136
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,943
>> Laura: I GET IT.

137
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:32,179
>> I THINK THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE

138
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,446
AT.

139
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:33,347
>> Laura: THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE

140
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:34,148
WORRIED ABOUT.

141
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,482
JOHN, SO MANY THINGS IN THIS

142
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,751
HEARING THAT WERE WILD.

143
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:39,319
ONE WAS WHEN HE WAS ASKED,

144
00:05:57,872 --> 00:06:01,208
QUESTION ABOUT DID YOU READ THIS

145
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,876
FISA WARRANT?

146
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:05,946
HE SAID YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

147
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:10,451
HE SAID I HAVE 100,000

148
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:10,818
EMPLOYEES.

149
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,320
BUT WANTS TO ROOT OUT ANY

150
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:13,721
CORRUPTION.

151
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,859
HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T READ THE

152
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,562
WARRANT OR GLANCED OVER SO HE

153
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:23,263
CAN'T REMEMBER THE SPECIFICS.

154
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:25,365
THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS MOVING SO

155
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:25,666
SLOW.

156
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:29,570
AT THIS POINT, THE DOJ HAS TO

157
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:31,371
STOP WITH THE GLACIER

158
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,239
PERFORMANCE AND THE AMERICAN

159
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,640
PEOPLE WANT TO SPEED IT UP AND

160
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:36,276
GET THE ANSWERS OUT THERE.

161
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:38,746
>> Laura: AND GOWDY WENT CRAZY

162
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:41,482
A QUESTION.

163
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:45,152
BUT TO TAKE HIS TIME TO MAKE

164
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:47,855
SURE HE GOT QUOTED AND THE SOUND

165
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:51,825
BITE WAS USED ON MOST EVENING

166
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:52,192
NEWSCAST.

167
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:53,794
CABLE AND SOCIAL MEDIA:

168
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:54,962
GET THIS THING WRAPPED UP.

169
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:57,531
WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?

170
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:02,402
PRESSING ANOTHER MATTER ABOUT

171
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:02,836
PETER STRZOK.

172
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,238
I WANT TO PLAY THAT AND GET

173
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:10,377
>> WHY DID YOU TELL PETER STRZOK

174
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:11,912
NOT TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS

175
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:12,279
YESTERDAY.

176
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,748
I ASKED HIM IF HE EVER

177
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:19,553
COMMUNICATED WITH GLENN SYMBOLS.

178
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:22,689
-- SIMPSON.

179
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,659
HE SAID I CAN'T ANSWER THAT

180
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,393
QUESTION.

181
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:26,660
WHY?

182
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,561
>> I DIDN'T GIVE PETER STRZOK

183
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:30,230
ANY INSTRUCTIONS.

184
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:33,367
HOW DO I KNOW?

185
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,771
>> THAT WORKS FOR YOU, IT

186
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:39,673
DOESN'T WORK FOR US.

187
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:40,307
>> Laura: I DON'T THINK

188
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,441
ROSENSTEIN CAME ALL WELL.

189
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,310
HE CAME OFF AS DEFENSIVE AND

190
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:49,716
MEAN TO ME IN THE MEDIA.

191
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:51,752
WELCOME TO THE BIG-LEAGUES.

192
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:53,854
THE DEPUTY AG IS HOT RIGHT NOW.

193
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,123
THERE ARE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE 2

194
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:01,695
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CASE THE

195
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,931
RUSSIA CASE AND THE HILLARY

196
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,532
EMAIL CASE, THEY DOVE TAIL

197
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:06,500
TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THIS AGENT.

198
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:13,207
HE HAD A DUTY TO FIND OUT WHAT

199
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:13,574
HAPPENED.

200
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,108
>> I THINK HE DID BETTER THAN

201
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,414
TWO IMPORTANT THINGS.

202
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:21,548
ROSENSTEIN MADE TWO POINTS.

203
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:25,619
NUMBER 1, I AM NOT THE ONE AND

204
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,223
NOBODY AT DOJ AS OPPOSEED TO THE

205
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:32,926
FBI, NOBODY IN ROSENSTEIN'S SHOP

206
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:35,229
TOLD PETER STRZOK WHAT TO SAY OR

207
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:44,538
TO DO WITH THE REDACTIONS

208
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:52,579
INCLUDING THE LATEST OUTRAGEOUS

209
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:52,946
REDACTION.

210
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,882
WHEN HE WAS TOLD THERE WERE

211
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,717
REDACTIONS HE BROUGHT IN A U.S.

212
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:57,818
ATTORNEY FROM CHICAGO.

213
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:00,254
FOR MANY YEARS ON AND OFF, THERE

214
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,989
HAS BEEN A ROGUE ELEMENT IN THE

215
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,124
FBI LEADERSHIP THAT OBSTRUCTS

216
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,461
THESE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS.

217
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:10,230
OBVIOUSLY IT'S OUTRAGE.

218
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,232
HA TEXT MESSAGE WAS NOT SENT TO

219
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:12,666
THE CONGRESS.

220
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,501
THE QUESTION IS:

221
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:15,903
WHAT WILL BE DONE ABOUT IT?

222
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:18,171
I THINK THE DOJ SHOULD DO

223
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:20,107
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

224
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,876
>> Laura: ANDY, ANY

225
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:24,578
REPURCUSSIONS FOR WHAT WAS DONE?

226
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,914
I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT, MEANING

227
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:27,981
INTENT TO  BE A PROBLEM.

228
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:30,550
TRUMP WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

229
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:31,985
THAT DOESN'T GO TO THE CONGRESS?

230
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:32,552
>> OF COURSE.

231
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,689
THIS IS THE PROBLEM I THINK THAT

232
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,490
ROSENSTEIN HAS.

233
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:39,226
I THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, I WONDERED

234
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:47,467
HIS ANSWERS WERE SINCIBLE BUT --

235
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:49,603
SENSIBLE BUT THE SMIRK ON HIS

236
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:50,871
FACE WAS OFF PUTTING.

237
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,114
YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE

238
00:10:01,115 --> 00:10:02,249
YOUR MOUTH IS.

239
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,152
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CREDIBLE

240
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,521
AND SAY AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE

241
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,423
GIVING YOU ALL OF THIS

242
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:09,823
COOPERATION.

243
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,959
WHEN WE FIND SOMEBODY WHO WITH

244
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,227
HOLDS STUFF, WE DON'T DISCIPLINE

245
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:14,528
THEM.

246
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,930
>> Laura: WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR

247
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:18,532
FROM OFFICIALS:

248
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,650
MAKE SURE HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T

249
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:38,251
GET PROSECUTED AND THEY WERE

250
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:45,192
WHY ISN'T THIS GUY ROSENSTEIN

251
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:45,492
ANGRY?

252
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:56,470
HEAD COACHERSHIP POSITIONS.

253
00:10:56,471 --> 00:11:00,173
-- I HELD LEADERSHIP POSITIONS

254
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:01,341
AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.

255
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:03,677
>> Laura: THE BUCK STOPS HERE?

256
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:04,177
I GUESS NOT.

257
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:05,712
>> THEY LET STRZOK OUT A COUPLE

258
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:07,547
OF WEEKS AGO.

259
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,386
>> YES.

260
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:14,621
IT'S NOT LIKE HE IS GONE.

261
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,490
HE IS OVER THERE.

262
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:19,626
>> Laura: BUT HE WAS MOVED TO

263
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,628
HUMAN RESOURCES.

264
00:11:21,629 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WE NEED HUMAN RESOURCES.
