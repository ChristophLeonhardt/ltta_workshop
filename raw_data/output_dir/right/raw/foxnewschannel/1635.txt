WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS WEDDING

61
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:11,581

71
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:28,164

00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:29,399
>> IT IS.

73
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:35,939
IT'S A  VERY STRONG POPULAR TIME

STRONGEST MONARCH IN BRITISH

00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,418
HISTORY.

78
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,920
PRINCE HARRY HUGELY POPULAR

79
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,491
PARTICULARLY AMONG THE YOUNGER

80
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:54,891
GENERATION.

81
00:02:54,891 --> 00:03:01,264
THIS WEDDING DEMONSTRATES THAT.

82
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,333
ALSO IT'S WONDERFUL THAT PRINCE

83
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,070
HARRY IS MARRYING AN AMERICAN.

84
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,206
A SYMBOL OF THE DEPTH OF OUR

85
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:10,640
RELATIONSHIP.

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,776

FATHER?

93
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,828
>> IT'S SAD THAT HEALTH REASONS

94
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:32,829
PREVENT MEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER

95
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,530
FROM COMING.

96
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,265
WE WISH HIM A COMPLETE RECOVERY

97
00:03:35,265 --> 00:00:00,000
AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN
