third party time says for those saying the Cavanaugh was young when he groped young girls why don't any of these reporters ask them if it's okay for him to lie about it now that he's an adult is it okay to have a Supreme Court full of people we can't trust me truthful about their past that is a very good question because yeah I think it is different thing to say hey come on he was 17 and and one to say oh come on of course he's lying about it now why would he be truthful if he's gonna go on the Supreme Court and in fact why np7 then writes in why are we even having conversation about sexual assault this suit is blatantly lied to Congress on multiple occasions perjury should be enough to keep this guy off any court for life now if you haven't heard those stories that's absolutely right he lied about two things very very clearly a Republican Senate staffer Manuel Miranda had accessed and downloaded thousands of computer files belonging to Democratic senators in a confirmation hearing when he was appointed to be a judge lower at a lower level in the federal system they asked him about whether he had received those he said no he had not very very clearly and it turns out we just found out an emails released this year that he did receive them in fact one of them said the word spying on it so clear absolute lie in another case in the case of Charles Pickering he was nominated to the Fifth Circuit in 2001 at the time Kavanaugh was working with the Bush administration trying to confirm these judges did you work on that no I did not work on that case now we find out in fact he absolutely worked on that confirmation and in fact was the primary person handling that nomination Russ Feingold who was one of the senators questioning him back then wrote a piece saying Cavanaugh has literally never appeared before the Senate and not lied every single time that he's come in front of the Senate in any of these hearings he has lied so I heard from the Republicans that perjury was enough to impeach someone that's what they said about Bill we have clear overwhelming evidence of perjury by Cavanaugh okay there's just like who cares who cares let's promote him to the Supreme Court and and now of course with these heavier charges at play it also questions his credibility now one last comment here hashtag TYT live to tweet to us during the show when it's live 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern strange Brut says don't forget that Julie sweating his account of gang raping girls who are intoxicated is corroborated by judges ex-girlfriend who says in The New Yorker piece the judge admitted to such activity that's right so now read the New York piece New Yorker piece it has a little bit more nuance than that but but the essence of it is very similar to that it she just judge mark judge him by the way I got to correct myself a couple of times I slipped up Mike Mike judge I feel terrible about that so if I was a Republican but no it is my judge okay so it's it's it's Mark judge's girlfriend who went out with him for three years and said no they talked about he told me about trying to get girls in a state where they couldn't say no and several men being involved etc so that does match the third accusers fact pattern why is it Mark judge testifying that's a great question you don't want mark judge to testify they don't want the FBI investigation to do an extensive background check why Mark judge backs up Kavanaugh story why won't you want him to testify and why would Christine Blasi Ford put mark judge a well-known friend and conservative friend of Kavanaugh and a conservative writer to this day why would she put him in the room and make that part up if she if she was making it up for a political trick and Republicans why on God's green earth wouldn't you want a corroborating witness for Kavanaugh unless you're afraid of what we might find out about what mark judging Cavanagh have done together on the go don't worry we got you covered you still listen to TYT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google Play Store or at TYT comm slash podcast
