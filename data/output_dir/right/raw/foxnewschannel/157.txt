00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,077
OF COURSE MOST POLITICIANS

58
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:55,713
CONTINUE TO JUST IGNORE THE

59
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:56,914
WISHES OF THE PEOPLE, SO WHAT

60
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:59,717

65
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:07,291

66
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,058
THEY REFUSE TO PASS LEGISLATION

67
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:12,296
TO ALLOW FOR IMMEDIATE BORDER

68
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:13,330
TURN BACKS OF ANYONE CROSSING

00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:15,599
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY.

70
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,668

71
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,805
AGAINST ALL RULES.

72
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,708
DONALD TRUMP WON THE PRESIDENCY

73
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,877
IN LARGE PART BECAUSE HE

74
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:27,678
WOULDN'T EXPECT THE STATUS QUO

75
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,712
ON IMMIGRATION.

76
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:29,714
AS USUAL, HE WAS FIVE

77
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:32,416
STEPS AHEAD OF MOST EVERY

78
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,585
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ON THE

79
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,120
ISSUE.

80
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:38,322
IN JULY THEY FOUND THAT

81
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:39,056
AMERICANS IDENTIFIED IMMIGRATION

82
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:41,592
HAS THE TOP ISSUE FOR THEM GOING

83
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:42,660
INTO THE MIDTERMS.

84
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,728
LAST MONTH IT WAS THE SECOND

85
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:45,996
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TIED WITH

86
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:49,566
JUST GENERAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.

87
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,002
DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THAT A FOCUS

88
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:54,305
ON THE TYPICAL ISSUE OF CHILD

89
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:55,339
SEPARATION, A PRACTICE OF THE

90
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,308
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW ENDED,

91
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:58,709
THAT THAT WOULD TURN OUT TO

92
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,177
VOTERS AND GET DEMOCRATS OR

93
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:00,911
LATINO VOTERS REALLY EXCITED TO

94
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,313
GET OUT THERE.

95
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:04,581
I DON'T THINK IT IS WORKING FOR

96
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:05,516
THEM.

97
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,918
REMEMBER BACK IN 2016, AT THE

98
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,120
LATINO VOTER TURNOUT DID NOT

99
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:10,487
INCREASE.

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,558
WALL AND A LOT OF STRONGER

102
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,093
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

103
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:18,429
OF COURSE HISPANIC AMERICANS ARE

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,298
THEMSELVES DISPROPORTIONATELY

105
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,333

106
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,901
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, AND THEIR

107
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:24,702
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEIR

108
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:25,102
COMMUNITIES.

109
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:27,538
DITTO FOR BLACK AMERICANS.

110
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,709
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT AS THE

111
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,245
SECOND CARAVAN DRAMA UNFOLDS, IT

112
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,680
TURNS OUT THAT SOME

113
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:37,781
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS ARE

114
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,350
WAKING UP TO THE WISDOM OF

115
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,719
TRUMP.

116
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,487

117
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,288
DEBATE MORE ON TRUMP'S TERMS.

118
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:48,058
THERE IS NO RIGHT TO COME TO

119
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:48,892
AMERICA.

120
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:52,096
WE CAN HAVE RULES OF WHO COMES.

121
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,063
WHERE IS MEXICO?

122
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:54,064
THEY NEED TO HELP US.

123
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,499
LAST TIME I CHECKED YOU JUST

124
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,267

DOES NOT STOP, HE WILL CUT OFF

FOREIGN AID.

132
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,483
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAS WARNED

133
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:13,450
THEM ABOUT HONDURAS, GUATEMALA

134
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,886
AND EL SALVADOR TO TELL THEIR

135
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:17,488
PEOPLE DO NOT MAKE THE DANGEROUS

136
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:18,688
TREK TO AMERICA.

137
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,924
THE U.S. WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS

138
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,093
BLATANT DISREGARD FOR OUR BORDER

139
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:23,694
AND SOVEREIGNTY.

140
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,463
BY THE WAY, HONDURAS IS ON TRACK

141
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:29,066

142
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:32,036

143
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,003
UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR, 2019.

145
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,180
AS FRUSTRATED AS SO MANY AS LSR,

146
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:43,914
THE CAUSE MAY BE TOTALLY LOST IF

147
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:44,615

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,087
ABOLISHING THE ILLEGAL

IMMIGRATION GANGS COME MS-13,

155
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,964
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM FROM TOP TO

156
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:03,901
BOTTOM.

157
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:04,768
STARTING BY REPLACING I.C.E WITH

158
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:07,738
SOMETHING THAT REFLECTS OUR

159
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:08,105
MORALITY.

160
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,706
>> WE CAN REPLACE IT AND WE CAN

161
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:12,476
REPLACE IT WITH A HUMANE AGENCY

162
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:14,645
THAT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS SAFE

163
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:17,281
PASSAGE.

164

THEY ARE NOT ALONE OF COURSE.

167
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,487
THERE ARE A LOT MORE LIKE THEM

168
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,322
THAT BELIEVE THE SAME THING.

169
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:27,191
AGAIN, THEY COULD NOT BE CLEAR

170
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:28,492
FOR THE MIDTERM VOTERS.

171
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,961
THERE SO MUCH ON THE LINE FOR

172
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,196
AMERICA.

173
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,697
WE'LL TRUMP GET THE FUNDING FOR

174
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:34,264
HIS WALL?

175
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:38,001

COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA WE

177
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:40,604

CITIZENSHIP FINALLY BE ENDED?

181
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:49,513
WILL WE MANDATE TO PENALIZE

182
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:50,614
BUSINESSES WHO GAIN THE SYSTEM

183
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:53,851

184
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,819
OF THIS MY FRIENDS YOU CAN BE

185
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,721
SURE, YOUR VIEWS ON IMMIGRATION

186
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:01,458
WILL HAVE ZERO IMPACT AND ZERO

187
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,460

188
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:06,463

189
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:08,332
YOU, THE AMERICAN VOTERS, WITH

190
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,500
