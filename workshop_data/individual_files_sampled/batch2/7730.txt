wait a second wait a second you're reporting based on sources that heard this from the home bin Salman that he has been boasting that the president's son-in-law gave him us intelligence about who his own internal enemies are the prince is saying I have Kushner in my pocket because the intercepts reporting was that Jarrod's dad Charles Kushner had again asked for a big Qatari investment and the intercept reported that the Qataris again said no maybe the reason the US government took this radical and sudden unexplained turn against Qatar is because Qatar wouldn't give Jared's family any money let's start this tale in 2005 so that year Charles Kushner is under investigation by federal prosecutors for tax evasion and questionable election contributions during that time a member of his family is cooperating with prosecutors against him so he gets the idea to hire a sex worker film the sex worker doing her business with the relative then use that videotape against his family member to blackmail him into no longer cooperating with with prosecutors as you can imagine where the Coen brothers like scheme like this it all collapsed and they caught him doing that and so not only was he convicted of tax evasion and improper financial contributions to politicians but they also tacked on tampering with a witness intimidating a witness charge so he got hit with that extra felony as well so he goes to prison in 2005 because he goes to prison Jared Kushner takes over Kushner companies at the time he's something like 25 26 years old and he's brash he's ready to make his mark he's arriving on the Manhattan scene he's overseeing this billion-dollar real estate company he decides he's gonna sell all of these properties that they have in New Jersey that they're renting out the tenants and used the money from that and dumped it into a building at 666 Fifth Avenue which at the time was selling or he was willing to pay 1.8 billion dollars for so he sinks basically much of the the family's fortune into this property five hundred million dollars cash and then borrow the rest he did this in 2007 when people who weren't even involved with real estate could see that the real estate crash was coming the property becomes badly underwater and so the family is then searching around the globe for refinancing schemes in 2011 they managed to sell off almost half the building to stave off foreclosure but they have a balloon payment due in February 20 19 and so they've been hunt they've been hunting for billions since then to try and shore up this property because in real estate everything is cross-collateralized and if a big thing goes down everything else is problematic that brings us to when Jared Kushner is trying to work the Gulf region because if you need this kind of money you're you're either getting it from the Russians you're getting it from the Chinese or you're getting it from the Gulf there might be some other outliers in Malaysia or Latvia but in general those are your three big pools of capital and so cushion continues pressing hard on Qatar which is this kind of gas rich Peninsula right in the Persian Gulf and they get very close to a five hundred million dollar deal with Hamid bin Jassim Al Thani who was a foreign prime minister of Qatar and one of if not the richest person in the country that deal fell through Tom Barak good friend of Charles Kushner and Donald Trump has since told The Washington Post that they were that the cushions were crushed when that deal fell through just weeks later Jared Kushner plays a pivotal role in supporting a blockade of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and the UAE and some allied countries the nation of Qatar unfortunately has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level and in the wake of that conference nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar over its behavior all right there's the Qatar blockade Trump and Kirchner took a side against American foreign policy interests because alone was not forthcoming for a half of that's the suggestion right then there's this warring royal family in Saudi Arabia and Trump and Kushner have taken aside including possibly sharing United States intelligence in the president's Daily Brief about who your enemies are who you can round up and they've taken the side because why well we don't we don't know why but one of the sources of financing for 660 Fifth Avenue certainly would be Saudi Arabia the prince is saying I have Kushner in my pocket beacause yeah his evidence is that you know when I met with him in late October of this year he brought me the names of political dissidents within the royal family and other elites and in Saudi society that US intelligence had collected and determined we're kind of skeptical of the crown prince's rapid rise a week later is when this famous kind of rich royal roundup happened where you know that they turned the Ritz Carlton Riyadh into a into a prison cushion makes an unannounced trip to Riyadh so this is this is late October it it catches a lot of intelligence officials off-guard news didn't leak out about the trip until he had almost returned from it we learned afterwards that Kushner spent several evenings staying up till 4:00 a.m. talking strategy and politics with Mohammed bin Salman who is the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who who only became Crown Prince in June when he ousts 'td his cousin Muhammad bin Nayef who had who had been next in line a week later Mohammed bin Salman launches a crackdown he rounds up dozens of royal family members and other elites it extended eventually into hundreds he imprisoned many of them in the ritz-carlton converting it into a luxury prison some of them were tortured at least one of them was tortured to death we now know what we've been able to report now is that following his meeting with Kushner MBs told his confidants including Mohammed bin Zayed who is the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the effective leader of the UAE he told him that Kushner had given him the name of some Saudis that were disloyal to him and said that Kushner was in his pocket we were not in this meeting of course we don't know exactly what happened but independently we can confirm that there were intelligence reports that included names like this and that Kushner had access to these names and that Kushner showed an extra level of engagement when the intelligence briefings that he was in were around the subject of politics in the Gulf region Yousefi Oh Taiba I first heard about it in your reporting about sex trafficking you also reported in that article that he's a buddy of Jared Kushner's and also can you weave in Rex Tillerson to the story so it's yeah so Tom Barak who we mentioned earlier connected Oh Taiba and and Kushner because the UAE didn't just like everyone else in the planet did not expect Trump to win and so when he did they were caught a little bit flat-footed they've lucked out in the sense that Oh Taiba and Mike Pompeo have been very close for a long time and so they're going to be just fine but as they initially started out o tayba until a table and Kushner became very close and Kushner would go to a table to ask him to explain you know the Middle East and so he would tutor him o tayba the UAE and Saudi Arabia have very much hated Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when the blockade was announced by Saudi Arabia UAE in June immediately tried to negotiate a way out of it the United States has a huge military presence in Qatar it's a staging ground for the projection of all sorts of power around around the region and there are commercial interests there's defense interested on and on it was not in the United States interest for there to be a crisis among these Gulf countries immediately after Tillerson called for a negotiated end of this and called for an end of the blockade Trump put out a statement and went to Twitter to say well Qatar is just a bunch of terrorists and they fund terrorism and so you know go get him and so it later turned out that it was Jared Kushner acting on behalf of o tayba or taking a statement from o tayba you know who had instigated that about-face recently there's been more reporting and I have sources that got confirmed this that Mohammed bin Zayed and bin Salman are both bragging that they were able to get Tillerson fired they now I think that it's a little more complicated than that Trump you might remember it fired him shortly after this statement that he gave on on Russia though it's unclear already been fired before that which helped him have the confidence to make a statement like that but absolutely the influence that had been injected by these Gulf countries coloured Trump's perception of Tillerson and you know he understood that he would be doing his friends over there a favor if he got rid of them we have a question about the status of the royal family members that were arrested they've all been released a lot of them are on house arrest can't you know and a lot of them you know cut deals in order to get their freedom and and these are many of these people by the way our pieces of work themselves these are people who were indeed you know stealing from stealing from the Saudi government I mean they were they Saudi government it was it was you know it was just kind of a way of doing business there that that if you ran a private company that was funded by the government you skimmed a huge portion off the top that that absolutely happened and Mohammed Salim would be correct that you would that you would want to end that practice a lot of these stories were first reported by you and the intercept and only now for instance as Charles Kushner Jared's dead admitting that it's true that he met with right it is a good one so yeah so we reported early March March second that the April prior Charles Kushner had met with the cutter ease and hit them up for cash just earlier this week he finally gave a statement to the Washington Post saying yes it's true that I met with them but we weren't going to take their money that would be wrong I would not it would it would it would look bad that that's and that's an ethical transgression that I could never abide this is a man who hired a prostitute in order to set up a family member to try to get himself out of a fraud prosecution and got caught for it and wound up going to prison just a few years ago but maybe he has been rehabilitated and has found a new sense of of ethics but it doesn't explain why he would go to the meeting you know in the business world there's very much you know much can much can be gleaned from where a meeting was held and and what the power dynamic is so the fact that the cutter EES were staying at the st. Regis Hotel and Kushner came to them undermines his argument that he was just it was just a courtesy meeting and if they would have offered money he would have said oh please please please no put that money away here my son is in the white house that would be horrible if I took this foreign money from you so a he went to them B why the follow-up meeting why meet the next day did you need to courtesy meetings to tell him that you won't take the money that part of it never made sense okay so Sarah Talbot was bringing up the security clearance so you reported that it's actually your first paragraph that while he still had security clearance which is up until very recently and in this story it's during the time when the administration was choosing sides he was a voracious reader of the PDB I think that's the most important part that United States intelligence is being used to take sides in this royal family battle if it's true you know we weren't in the meeting we don't know what koechner actually did but but yes so the Mohammed bin Salman claim to his confidence is that Kushner shared with him this intelligence intelligence he would have been able to glean from from these briefings that's right he so Koecher only had a handful of names of the dozens that were arrested would have been from the result of this if if that's what if that's what actually happened secondly he probably knew already who he was going to round up I think it just kind of helps him politically to be able to say this guy's in my pocket look you know you're trying to go up against me you're going up against me and the White House the White House helped me with this do you see that that chain around the the gold necklace around president Trump's neck there well Saudi King Salman presented that to the president it's a gold medal here so here's something else to look at when Trump went there in May there is an exception to the public gift rule if you get if you're a public serving you get a gift that's cost more than like $50 or so you have to give it back to the government and the government keeps it puts it a museum sells it whatever they do with it there's one exception and that's awards and medals so if you get a medal for being the greatest Saudi Arabian supporter in the world you can keep that metal if these are diamonds that could be worth millions of dollars if it's is it just an ego boost or a bribe if it's studded with diamonds yeah Wow what do you think well I works both ways for Trump know you know make him feel good about himself it's been reported I think in that in The Times recently that there's a new molar witness who's been granted immunity and his story is is that the Saudis have been funneling money to Trump political organizations right and so this has been going on and this is what we've been talking about for I've been writing about for years and we've been talking about here for a long time and table was the one who kind of facilitated this for the UAE that he that that it funnels a lot of money into Washington in order to influence our foreign policy thinking in this case it was running into a counter channel through this guy George Nader to this other guy Eliot Brody who then pumped it into think tanks and the think tanks held kind of antique utter conferences where academics and policy makers would get up and give their presentations about what's wrong with what's wrong with Qatar and and we reported on these at the time because they appeared to be funded by the UAE and we asked them are you getting money from the UAE for these and they told us very specifically on we do not take foreign money on principle so no absolutely not so now we know that it depends on what your definition is a foreign money it was foreign money and then that was given to broidy and then broidy gave it to them doesn't mean it's not foreign money anymore because you had a middleman that passed it on I think that's something that they're going to have to answer for in the wake of this article but there's more reporting to be the end of investigation to be done on that well there's gonna get to the bottom of it because he has this guy Nader singing although Nader's back in the UAE didn't they call him back you can call somebody back does that mean they're gonna come back would you would you come back and he's got immunity soap and he's gone to prison twice for pedophilia oh my god real our him I probably would not come back the finest people we just define the best the best people
