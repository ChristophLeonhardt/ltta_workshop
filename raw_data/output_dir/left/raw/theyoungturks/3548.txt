1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,070
THE

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,230
OPIOID EPIDEMIC CONTINUES TO
RAVAGE HUGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,450
AND THE QUESTION STILL REMAINS:
HOW IS IT THAT THE DRUG INDUSTRY

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,379
WAS ABLE TO SELL SO MANY OF
THESE PILLS IN AN UNMITIGATED

5
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:14,379
FASHION?

6
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:17,640
WELL INTO INVESTIGATIVE
REPORT, AN INCREDIBLE ONE DONE

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,020
BY 60 MINUTES IN THE WASHINGTON
POST SHOWS A THEME THAT IS ALL

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,480
TOO COMMON IN AMERICAN POLITICS.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,029
CORRUPTION, THE REVOLVING DOOR

10
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:32,098
POLITICS, LOBBYING, AND A PROFIT
MOTIVE THAT LED INDIVIDUALS TO

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,550
SUPPORT THE SALE OF THESE DRUGS,
THE UNMITIGATED SALE OF THIS

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,440
DRUGS FOR PROFIT OVER THE LIVES
OF ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,969
HAVE DIED.

14
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,170
NOW, THE STORY IS
CRAZY BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,600
LAWMAKERS IN CONGRESS
UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,700
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD STRIP THE
DEA OF ITS ABILITY TO SUSPEND A

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,739
QUESTIONABLE AND SUSPICIOUS
NARCOTICS SALES IN THE WAY THAT

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,210
THEY DID THAT IS THEY RECEIVED A
TON OF MONEY FROM THESE

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,450
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES AND
FROM DISTRIBUTORS SO THEY COULD

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,590
STRIP THE DEA OF ANY POWER THAT
IT HAD TO REGULATE AND ENFORCE

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,300
LAWS TO PREVENT THE OVERUSE AND
THE OVER DISTRIBUTION OF

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,430
OPIOIDS.

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,050
ACCORDING TO THE PIECE:

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:27,630
SO 
WHAT HAPPENED?

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,450
WHAT WAS
THE NEW LEGISLATION AND WHAT DID

26
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:44,270
IT DO TO STRIP THE DEA OF ITS
POWER?

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,590
SO ESSENTIALLY, IN THE
BEGINNING, IF THE DEA SAW THAT

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,170
THERE WERE DRUG DISTRIBUTORS
DISTRIBUTING A SON OF OPIOID

29
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,899
PILLS TO A SPECIFIC PHARMACY,
THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY FREEZE

30
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,960
THAT TYPE OF TRANSACTION IN
ORDER TO INVESTIGATE TO MAKE

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,180
SURE THAT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
ILLEGAL OR DANGEROUS GOING ON

32
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,370
THOUGHTS WILL CONGRESS PASSED
LEGISLATION THAT CHANGE THE

33
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,480
BURDEN OF PROOF NECESSARY FOR
THE DEA TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,040
THINK ABOUT IT AS THE DIFFERENCE
OF A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,250
TO BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.

36
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,250
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE WHEN IT

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,060
COMES TO BURDEN OF PROOF THERE
AND THEY MADE IT SO DIFFICULT

38
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,530
THAT IT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THE DEA TO STEP IN AND

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,310
FREEZE OR SUSPEND THESE DRUG
SALES.

40
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,640
JUST TWO THINGS THERE
ALREADY.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,400
ONE IS THE ONLY REASON

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,620
YOU DO THAT IS YOU WANT TO
MAKE SURE THE DRUGS KEEP

43
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,830
FLOWING.

44
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,040
THE DRUG COMPANIES HAVE
A PROFIT MOTIVE HERE.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
THEY WANT

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,520
TO SELL MORE DRUGS.

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,450
SO WHAT DO
THEY DO?

48
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,730
THEY DO WHAT IS

49
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,730
LOGICAL.

50
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,870
THEY GO AND BUY OFF
AMERICAN POLITICIANS SO THEY CAN

51
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,440
CHANGE THE RULES TO ALLOW THEM
TO DO THAT AT A GREATER RATE.

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,520
THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THE
NUMBER ONE CONTRIBUTORS TO

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,850
POLITICIANS IN AMERICA.

54
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,900
MORE
THAN THE OIL COMPANIES, THE

55
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,560
BANKS, AND THEY ARE THE BIGGEST
PRACTITIONERS OF CRONY

56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,750
CAPITALISM DOS OF THE STORY IS
AMAZING, BUT THEY ALSO DO IN

57
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,860
OTHER WAYS THAT THEY HAVE
EXTENDED THAT MONOPOLY FROM FIVE

58
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,070
YEARS TO 12 ON SOME OF THESE
DRUGS.

59
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,971
THEY DON'T ALLOW US, THE

60
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:17,320
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO
NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER DRUG PRICES

61
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
FOR MEDICARE.

62
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,120
THAT IS INSANE.

63
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,810
THAT $1 MILLION THAT THEY INVEST

64
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,490
WINDS UP GETTING GREAT RETURN ON
INVESTMENT, BUT THE DEGREE TO

65
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,670
WHICH OUR POLITICIANS ARE
CROOKED IS UNFORTUNATELY

66
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,350
INDESCRIBABLE, BECAUSE
YOU KNOW THE RESULTS.

67
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,960
IT IS NOT LIKE ANYBODY VOTING ON
THAT BILL DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

68
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,810
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIGGER
FLOW OF DRUGS AND IT WAS

70
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,530
GOING TO AFFECT MORE PEOPLE AND
LEAD TO MORE ADDICTION BUT

71
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,520
THEY ARE LIKE YES, BUT
THEY DID NOT PAY ME.

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,710
THESE GUYS PAID ME.

73
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,730
PRIVATE FINANCING OF ELECTIONS
LEADS TO POLITICIANS

74
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,410
WORKING FOR PRIVATE INTERESTS.

75
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,400
AND THIS CASE, THE DRUG
COMPANIES.

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,760
WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN
THEY SELL IS OUT ON THEIR

77
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
BEHALF TO.

78
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,260
EXACTLY AND I WANT TO BE
CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING.

79
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,260
THIS WAS

80
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,680
NOT LEGISLATION THAT CONGRESS
UNANIMOUSLY PASSED SEVERAL YEARS

81
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
AGO.

82
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,530
THIS IS LEGISLATION THAT
CONGRESS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED IN

83
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,460
APRIL 2016.

84
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,740
2016, SO THIS WAS
RECENT IN NEWS OF THE OPIOID

85
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,650
EPIDEMIC WAS ALREADY MAKING
HEADLINES.

86
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,650
PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW

87
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,760
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.

88
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,120
LIVES
ARE ALREADY BEING DESTROYED

89
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,360
BECAUSE OF THE OVER DISTRIBUTION
AND OVER PRESCRIPTION OF THESE

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,610
TYPES OF DRUGS.

91
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,180
NOW A JUDGE WHO
IS ESSENTIALLY TALKING ABOUT

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:42,140
THIS AND IS WRITING ABOUT THIS
FOR A LAW REVIEW JOURNAL SAID

93
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,140
THE FOLLOWING:

94
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:52,850
HE ALSO SAYS:

95
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,830
SO TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THIS NEW

96
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,420
LEGISLATION DOES, WHAT THIS NEW
LAW DOES SINCE IT IS NOT

97
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
LEGISLATION ANYMORE.

98
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:18,480
AGAIN, THEY
UNANIMOUSLY PASSED IT.

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,420
NOW THE REASON WHY WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE THERE HAS

100
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,140
BEEN A WHISTLEBLOWER WHO USED TO
WORK FOR THE DEA.

101
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
HIS NAME IS

102
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,880
JOE AND HE USED TO
RUN THE DEA'S OFFICE OF

103
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
DIVERSION

104
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,040
CONTROL AND SO HE FOCUSED
PRIMARILY ON PHARMACEUTICAL

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,850
DRUGS AND PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG
ABUSE AND HE SAW WHAT WAS GOING

106
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,850
ON.

107
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,520
HE PROPERTY AGGRESSIVELY TO
STOP THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION

108
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,370
AND UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS
UNSUCCESSFUL SO NOW HE IS

109
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,380
SPEAKING UP ABOUT IT.

110
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,280
THERE IS NO SITUATION WHERE IF
OUR REPRESENTATIVES ACTUALLY

111
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,280
RESENTED US THEY WOULD SAY YOU
KNOW WHAT, WE JUST RANDOMLY

112
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,030
THINK DRUG COMPANIES SHOULD BE
ABLE TO SET ANY PRICE THEY LIKE

113
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,700
AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF

114
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
AMERICANS.

115
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,930
THAT IS NOT A
SITUATION THAT EXISTS IN THE

116
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,930
WORLD.

117
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,930
THE ONLY REASON YOU DO
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU WERE OWNED

118
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,750
BY THEM AND BY THE WAY, THE
HAPPENED UNDER BUSH BUT ALSO

119
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,800
HAPPEN UNDER OBAMA AND THIS IS
DURING THE OBAMA YEARS IN BOTH

120
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,880
PARTIES OFTEN PLAY ALONG WITH
THAT SO HERE THEY ARE.

121
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
HERE'S A

122
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,830
SITUATION WHERE THE ONLY REASON
YOU WOULD SET A HIGHER BAR IS TO

123
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,580
MAKE SURE THE DRUGS KEEP FLOWING
IN THE DRUG, IF MAKE MONEY EVEN

124
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,540
THOUGH YOU KNOW THE ADDICTION IS
OUT OF CONTROL THE COUNTRY, YET

125
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,260
BOTH PARTIES GO WELL, WHERE'S MY
BREAD BUTTERED.

126
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
NOT BY THE

127
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
PUBLIC.

128
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,870
WE DON'T A PUBLIC
FINANCING, WE'RE PRIVATE

129
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,870
FINANCING.

130
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,920
THESE GUYS GIVE ME A
LOT OF MONEY.

131
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
I'M GOING TO DO

132
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,460
WITH THEY ASK THAT IT IF IT
LEADS YOU TO HAVE A FILM

133
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,440
EVER WHO IS ADDICTED TO DRUGS, I
DO NOT CARE TO BECOME A MONEY.

134
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,630
I WANT TO CALLED A FEW THE
POLITICIANS THAT WERE BEHIND

135
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,940
THIS LEGISLATION.

136
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,020
THOSE WHO
SPONSORED AND THOSE WHO ENDED UP

137
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,000
SUPPORTING IT PRETTY
AGGRESSIVELY.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
IN THE VERY

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,780
BEGINNING IT WAS REPRESENTATIVE
TOM MARINO.

140
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,200
ACCORDING TO THIS

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:18,050
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT:

142
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:25,330
SO BREAKING NEWS STORY TODAY WAS
THAT TRUMP CLAIMED THAT STARTING

143
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,430
NEXT WEEK, HE WILL CLAIM THAT
THERE IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY

144
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,669
DUE TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

145
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,520
WELL, YOU ARE NOW NAMING THE

146
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,870
SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO PRESSURED
CONGRESS TO PASS THIS TYPE OF

147
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,150
LEGISLATION TO BE THE DRUGS ARE.

148
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,150
YOU THINK HE IS GOING TO LOOK

149
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,180
OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF
AMERICANS THAT ARE BATTLING WITH

150
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,550
THIS TYPE OF ADDICTION?

151
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,540
NO, HE
CARES ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND

152
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,460
LOOKING OUT FOR THE DRUG
INDUSTRY THAT IS PATTING HIS

153
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,460
POCKETS.

154
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,180
IT IS CORRUPTION 101.

155
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,370
IN THE PAST, DRUGS ARE MET
YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT DRUG

156
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,449
START AND THIS CASE IT MIGHT
MEAN THAT HE IS THE ONE THAT

157
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,850
HELPS THE AMERICAN DRUG CARTELS
PUSH MORE DRUGS TO GET US MORE

158
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,270
ADDICTED WHICH LEADS TO HEROIN
OVERDOSE, OXYCONTIN OVERDOSING

159
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,270
LIST GOES ON.

160
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,820
HE IS PATIENT ZERO FOR THE
LEGISLATIVE PROBLEMS THAT

161
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,790
LED TO THE ADDICTION IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

162
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,540
TRUMP DID NOT PICK AND
BY ACCIDENT.

163
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,140
TRUMP WILL TAKE ANYONE WHO HAS
SOLD OUT THE CORPORATE

164
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,510
INTERESTS AND PUT THEM INTO THE
TOP POSITION.

165
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,770
BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS TURNING
THE SWAMP.

166
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,090
WHAT HAPPENED?

167
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,949
IT IS GROSS HOW BRAZEN THEY
ARE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IF YOU

168
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,950
WANTED TO COVER IT UP AND HE
WANTED TO BE SOPHISTICATED, YOU

169
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,900
WOULDN'T PICK MARINO, YOU WOULD
PICK ONE OF HIS LACKEYS.

170
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
LOWER-LEVEL GUY.

171
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,150
NO, HE
PICKED THE GUY WHO DID THE CRIME

172
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,890
IN THE FIRST PLACE DESPITE THE
FACT THAT HE HELPED PUSH THE

173
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,860
DRUG ADDICTION BUT BECAUSE OF
THAT FACT THAT ONE MORE THING

174
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,760
ABOUT TRUMP AND HIS PROMISES.

175
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,830
HE SAID IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT
OVER OBAMA WE DON'T

176
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,620
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES.

177
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,360
HE CAME IN AND IMMEDIATELY
SAID THAT TRUMP WILL NOT

178
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,010
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES.

179
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,610
OF COURSE.

180
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,160
BY THE WAY, WHEN IT COMES TO
THIS LAW THAT PASSED STRIPPING

181
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,610
THE DEA OF ITS POWER TO PROTECT
AMERICANS, OBAMA SIGNED THAT

182
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,180
LEGISLATION INTO LAW, SO THAT IS
ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND

183
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,550
AND WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING WAS
THAT THE WASHINGTON POST MADE IT

184
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,089
SEEM AS THOUGH, YOU KNOW, OBAMA
DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND OR

185
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,930
REALIZE THE RAMIFICATIONS.

186
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,070
HE
WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

187
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,070
STATES.

188
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,994
IF YOU ARE GOING TO
SIGN SOMETHING, YOU ARE SIGNING

189
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:29,800
YOUR NAME AND ALLOWING
LEGISLATION TO PASS INTO LAW,

190
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,320
YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT THAT DUCK
LIKE SOME OF THE ESTABLISHMENT

191
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,581
PRESS IS IN THE JOB OF
CRITICIZING TRUMP EVEN THOUGH HE

192
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:39,450
IS PART OF THE ELITE, ETC., THEY
CONSIDER HIM NOT PART OF THE

193
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,320
ESTABLISHMENT BUT MAN, THEY LOVE
TO COVER FOR OBAMA.

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
AND HERE,

195
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,279
IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE
A WONDERFUL REPORT, GREAT JOB OF

196
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,570
INVESTIGATING THIS BUT YOU CAN'T
HELP BUT SOFT-PEDAL OBAMA.

197
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,570
WHAT

198
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,339
KIND OF EXCUSES HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS IN IT THEN HE SHOULD'VE

199
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,860
FOUND OUT HE SHOULD'VE DONE HIS
HOMEWORK SO NO, NO EXCUSE FOR

200
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,720
THE DEMOCRATS AM A NO EXCUSE FOR
OBAMA.

201
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,570
THEY WOULD MAKE IT SEEM

202
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,920
LIKE OBAMA DIDN'T, OBAMA ALSO
GOT PRIVATE FINANCING.

203
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,960
HE GOT

204
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,040
HIS ENTIRE CABINET HANDED TO
THEM BY CITIGROUP EXECUTIVE BACK

205
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,350
IN 2008.

206
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,720
HE TOOK EVERY PERSON
ON THE LIST BUT ONE.

207
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
HIS ENTIRE

208
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,510
CABINET WAS HANDED TO HIM BY
CITIGROUP BECAUSE HIS NUMBER ONE

209
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,460
SET OF DONORS BACK IN 2008 WERE
THE BANKS.

210
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
YOU KNOW, ALL THE

211
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,060
ESTABLISHMENT WANTS TO DO IS GO
BACK TO THE PRE-TRUMP DAYS.

212
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,070
THEY WERE TERRIBLE.

213
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,330
WE HAD
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

214
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,580
SELLING US OUT DAY
IN AND DAY OUT.

215
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,390
IT WAS SO BAD, PEOPLE ARE SO
FRUSTRATED THAT THEY VOTED

216
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,390
FOR TRUMP.

217
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,720
THAT IS HOW BAD THE PRE-TRUMP
DAYS WERE.

218
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,970
FOR THEM IT WAS THE STATUS
QUOTE THEY WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK

219
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,970
TO THAT.

220
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,589
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
HOME GIRL MARSHA BLACKBURN

221
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,800
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO CALL
HER OUT.

222
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
WHEN IT COMES TO

223
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,520
LOBBYING, THERE WERE SEVERAL
SPECIFIC PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED A

224
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
LOT

225
00:10:51,520 --> 00:11:10,830
OF MONEY FROM THE DRUG INDUSTRY.

226
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,190
WHEN IT COMES TO MARSHA
BLACKBURN WHO IS A

227
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,830
REPRESENTATIVE IN TENNESSEE SHE
RESUMED HUNDRED AND $50,000.

228
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,600
YOU MAY KNOW SHE IS NOW RUNNING
TO FILL BOB CORKER'S SENATE SEAT

229
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,260
IN TENNESSEE, HOWEVER SHE MADE
NEWS LAST WEEK WHEN SHE RAN A

230
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,180
CONTROVERSIAL AD THAT TWITTERED
THE MONETIZE.

231
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,350
TAKE A LOOK THAT.

232
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,550
I'M 100% PRO-LIFE.

233
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,050
I THOUGHT
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND WE

234
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,400
STOPPED THE SALE OF BABY BODY
PARTS, THANK GOD.

235
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,800
PERSONAL, GO BACK AND WATCH
A VIDEO COVERAGE OF THAT

236
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,850
BECAUSE SHE IS LYING.

237
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,970
PLANNED PARENTHOOD NEVER SOLD
BABY BODY PARTS WITH THAT

238
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,050
IS INSIDE THE POINT THAT YOU ARE
PRO-LIFE?

239
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,370
YOU REPEATEDLY COSPONSORED
LEGISLATION THAT HELPED FUEL THE

240
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,290
DEATHS OF 200,000 AMERICANS
SINCE 2011.

241
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,310
YOU ARE PRO-LIFE?

242
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,130
KNOW YOU ARE A DISGUSTING
CORRUPT FRAUD AND YOU ARE ALSO A

243
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,310
LIER, BY THE WAY.

244
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,310
IT'S PATHETIC.

245
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,900
THIS PRO-LIFE BS.

246
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,430
PANDERING TO THE RELIGIOUS-BASE.

247
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,790
SHE IS NOT PRO-LIFE THE ONLY
THING SHE CARES ABOUT THE

248
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,240
COLD HARD CASH ñ LOVE THE
CORRUPTION.

249
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,850
THINK ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM IS
NOT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO GIVE

250
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,420
$150,000 TO A LOWLY
REPRESENTATIVE FROM TENNESSEE.

251
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
WHAT YOU THINK SHE IS GOING TO
DO?

252
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,510
DO THINK SHE IS GOING TO TAKE
THE HUNDRED $50,000

253
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,510
ABOUT AGAINST THEM?

254
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,100
KNOW, SHE IS GOING TO FOR THEM.,
THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY GETS A

255
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,330
DONATION YOU MIGHT SAY, THE
CORPORATION, THE DRUG COMPANIES

256
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,540
ARE TAKING A GAMBLE ON SOMEONE
LIKE HER.

257
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,540
THE SECOND TIME THEY

258
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,330
GET THE DONATION THAT MEANS I
GAMBLE PAID OFF.

259
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,330
SHE DID

260
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,940
EXACTLY AS SHE WAS TOLD.

261
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,370
THEY
GOT A RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

262
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,540
THAT IS WHY THEY BOUGHT HER
AGAIN AND THAT IS WHAT SHE IS.

263
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,610
IT INCLUDES ALL THE PEOPLE IN
THE STORY, INCLUDING THE CENTER

264
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,860
THAT ANNA MENTIONED THERE, THE
HUNDRED AND $77 TO LAUREN HATCH.

265
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,290
HE IS DEEPLY CROWD FOR DECADES
AND ALL THE TV AND THE REST OF

266
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,500
THE MEDIA DOES OFTENTIMES AS
COVER FOR HIM AND THEY SAY OH,

267
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,190
THE HONORABLE GENTLEMAN FROM
UTAH.

268
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,190
THAT HONORABLE GENTLEMEN

269
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,560
HAS TAKEN MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN LEGALIZED

270
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,850
BRIBES AND AS EVERYTHING THAT
HIS PRIVATE DONORS HAVE

271
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,850
ASKED HIM TO DO.

272
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,660
THAT IS WHO HE IS.

273
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,960
AND THEN FINALLY, THE THIRD
PART OF THIS ISSUE IS THE

274
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,700
REVOLVING DOOR POLITICS BECAUSE
THE SAME LAWYERS WHO WORKED WITH

275
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,810
THE DEA IN ORDER TO GO AFTER THE
INDUSTRY AND MAKE SURE THAT

276
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,649
JUSTICE WAS SERVED IF THERE WERE
ILLEGAL NARCOTICS DISTRIBUTIONS,

277
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:47,960
THOSE PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE THE DEA
AND GUESS WHAT?

278
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
THEY WOULD GO

279
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,779
REPRESENT THE DRUG INDUSTRY.

280
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,649
IN
FACT, THE PRIME EXAMPLE IN THIS

281
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,080
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER WAS
LYNDON BARBER.

282
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
HE WAS THE DEA'S

283
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,860
FORMER ASSOCIATE CHIEF COUNSEL
AND IN 2011, HE LEFT THE DEA TO

284
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,390
GO REPRESENT THE DRUG COMPANIES
AND HE IS JUST ONE OF MANY

285
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,830
INDIVIDUALS WHO USED TO WORK AT
THE DEA WHO THEN WENT TO GO WORK

286
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,830
FOR THE DRUG INDUSTRY AND THE
REASON WHY THAT IS TERRIBLE IS

287
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,450
BECAUSE WILL OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS
AN ISSUE WITH THEM NOT ACTUALLY

288
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,850
BEING GENUINE AND BEING PART OF
THE DEA.

289
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,360
IT'S ALL A SHOW FOR

290
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,830
MONEY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
THEY KNEW THE TACTICS THAT THE

291
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,370
DEA USED IN ORDER TO HELP
MITIGATE THE SALE AND

292
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,930
DISTRIBUTION OF THESE DRUGS
AND SO THEY WOULD GO AND

293
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,220
ESSENTIALLY SHARE THE SECRETS OF
THE DEA WITH THE INDUSTRY

294
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,399
SO THEY COULD EFFECTIVELY LOBBY
FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

295
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,660
HELP THEM OUT.

296
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,800
AND UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN, THE
CORRUPTION IS BIPARTISAN.

297
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,610
HOWARD DEAN, NOT RELATED TO THE
STORY BUT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

298
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,080
IT, USED TO CRITICIZE THE
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY.

299
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
THEN HE

300
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,870
BECAME A LOBBYIST FOR THEM AFTER
YOU STOP BEING IN THE GOVERNMENT

301
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,860
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE
PROGRESS OF HOWARD DEAN YOU

302
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,220
KNEW, GONE.

303
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,240
NOW HE IS DOING
SYMPOSIUMS ON HOW THE PRIVATE

304
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,910
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IS HELPING
TO SAVE AMERICA.

305
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,910
IT'S FUNNY WAS

306
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,080
SOMEBODY WILL DO IF THEY ARE
PAID TO DO IT.

307
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
YOU NEED PUBLIC

308
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,440
FINANCING SO THEY WORK FOR THE
PUBLIC INTEREST.

309
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
IF YOU ALLOW

310
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,480
FOR PRIVATE FINANCING, THEY WILL
WORK FOR THE PRIVATE INTERESTS

311
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,500
AND SINCE THE DRUG COMPANIES OF
THE NUMBER ONE DONORS IN

312
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,830
AMERICA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SET
THAT OPIOID ADDICTION.

313
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,399
EVERYTHING YOU SEE WILL BE A LOT
OF HUFFING AND PUFFING THE

314
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,370
BEHIND THE SCENES, THEY WILL
ALMOST ALL AGREE YEAH,

315
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,459
LET'S GIVE THE DONORS EXACTLY
WHAT THEY WANTED EVEN IF IT

316
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,800
COSTS AMERICAN LIVES.

317
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
EXACTLY.

318
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,460
I JUST WANT TO LIVE
WITH ONE STAT THAT SHOULD BLOW

319
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
YOUR MIND.

320
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,839
WEST VIRGINIA IS ONE
PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS

321
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,340
REALLY STRUGGLING WITH OPIOID
EPIDEMIC AND THE ARTICLE

322
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,480
MENTIONS THE FACT THAT BETWEEN
2007 IN 2012 THERE WAS ONE

323
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,470
DISTRIBUTOR KNOWN AS MIAMI LUCAN
WHO SHIPPED 20 MILLION DOSES OF

324
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,410
HYDROCODONE AND OXYCODONE TO
PHARMACIES IN WEST VIRGINIA.

325
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,529
20

326
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:02,610
MILLION BETWEEN 2007 IN 2012 BUT
ACCORDING TO THE PIECE DESPITE

327
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,040
THE RISING DEATH RATE IN WEST
VIRGINIA, THE HIGHEST IN THE

328
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,020
NATION, PLEASE IN 2013
TO HALT THEIR OPERATIONS WERE

329
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,649
IGNORED BY THE LEGAL OFFICE AT
HEADQUARTERS AND IT WAS

330
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,200
BECAUSE THEY WERE PRESSURED BY
CONGRESS TO LEAVE THESE

331
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,360
DISTRIBUTORS ALONE BECAUSE THESE
DISTRIBUTORS ARE FUNDING THEM.

332
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,070
THESE ARE LITERALLY DRUG
PUSHERS AND YOU WANT TO

333
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,720
TALK ABOUT A GATEWAY DRUG?

334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
IT IS NOT MARIJUANA.

335
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,420
IT IS
THESE LEGALIZED DRUGS AND YOU DO

336
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,390
NOT SEND ABOUT THAT AMOUNT OF
DRUGS TO WEST VIRGINIA AND NOT
