00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
firstly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say sorry I look so</font>

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,470
rough I'm down with flu at the moment

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,180
and I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make myself look</font>

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,120
reasonably presentable and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,610
failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> epicly as many of you would know</font>

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,980
there was very tragic nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> today in</font>

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,430
regards<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the conservative leader</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> David</font>

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cameron and his wife Samantha who lost</font>

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,960
this morning their six-year-old child

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,910
there some was ill with cerebral palsy

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,150
and a rare condition of epilepsy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,740
although he was in rough conditions for

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,810
most of his life he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in good care and</font>

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,640
of course the loss of a child will

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,070
always be a shock no matter what the

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,140
circumstances are now for me the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">I make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this video is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knock-on effect</font>

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,350
of this happening did shock me in a

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,840
certain way and that was with the fact

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,050
that in Parliament in prime minister

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,700
question time when the prime minister

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,280
gave his condolences when William Hague

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,350
stepped in for though Cameron and other

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,930
MPs showed their thoughts they managed

25
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put all their political views aside</font>

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,670
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually seemed human and there</font>

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,519
was this degree of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sincerity that is</font>

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,010
just so rarely shown by politicians of

29
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,840
today I feel and I'm sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it won't</font>

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,090
last for long give it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few days and I'm</font>

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,479
sure they will be back to heckling

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,520
laughing like schoolchildren and this is

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,530
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shame as travesty to live in a</font>

34
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,600
free society I'm in a part of a

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,430
generation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> never experienced what</font>

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,560
it is to not be free and it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,750
perhaps a reason why a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people do</font>

38
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,400
take it for granted and why a lot of

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,950
people do<font color="#E5E5E5"> abuse the freedoms that we do</font>

40
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,200
have how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this related I just find it</font>

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,630
remarkable how unfortunately due to the

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,759
death<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a child that that is the</font>

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,430
catalyst for politicians actually been

44
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,220
able to communicate in mature manners

45
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,619
and while coming across as human beings

46
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a shame that this can't always</font>

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,320
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case now of us all being in a</font>

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,229
time of recession is a dark time

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,810
economically and we're all struggling

50
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,170
but the realism behind it is it all

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,869
gives us a chance to reflect on what is

52
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,940
important in life we will experience

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,889
bereavement in life but the loss of a

54
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,290
child is a huge exception

55
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,819
no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have to ever experience</font>

56
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,590
that so what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of the video</font>

57
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may be asking well as many of you</font>

58
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,670
know my channel is all about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

59
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,530
about who you are not worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

60
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,989
slogans of being emo when you express

61
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,909
yourself and actually being true to<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

62
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,680
you are and unfortunately we live in a

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,689
society<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's safe fabricated with</font>

64
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,909
so much political correctness stand with

65
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,750
so much of this um notion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

66
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">people want to jump on others when</font>

67
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,769
they're down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep them down which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

68
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,079
especially big in the UK so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

69
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">question to you on this video is what</font>

70
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,579
would it take to mend the world with all

71
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,620
its problems in a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is</font>

72
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,560
empathetic everyone is human when

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,450
dealing with these issues what will<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

74
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,159
take for someone to stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their</font>

75
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,480
fellow man and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what would it</font>

76
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,269
take for a politician to talk to an

77
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:02,849
opponent on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and go you know</font>

78
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,769
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you say but</font>

79
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,450
I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know you have a</font>

80
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,010
right to express<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you feel and</font>

81
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,400
together with maturity and with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

82
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,609
common goal of wanting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> improve the</font>

83
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,549
world that we realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if one of us</font>

84
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,049
has proven wrong that's not a bad thing

85
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,870
because with being wrong a lesson is

86
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">learn and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also with one idea being</font>

87
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,430
dismissed which showed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> another idea</font>

88
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,799
is promoted forward it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad when</font>

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,500
you hear of tragic news and as I said

90
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">the death of a child is just horrific</font>

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,970
and my thoughts like that of many other

92
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,500
people in the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> fopen these is</font>

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,729
with the camera and family and you know

94
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,019
sincerity should be shown on occasion

95
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,269
like this and perhaps the question of

96
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,430
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take I've already answered</font>

97
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,840
the question with some of the points

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,150
I've made in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video and if some of</font>

99
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,500
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a redundant question</font>

100
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,569
that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be asked because</font>

101
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">you may say it's just the way it's going</font>

102
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be but my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question really is does it</font>

103
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,260
take the death of a child and to bring

104
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,479
politicians together because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no matter</font>

105
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,760
what our views are we're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

106
00:04:08,760 --> 00:00:00,000
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're human</font>
