NOT THE FBI THAT I KNOW, THIS IS
NOT THE FBI THAT OUR COUNTRY
NEEDS.
CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL WITH
HIS REACTION IN MOMENTS, BUT
FIRST, FBI FORMER ASSISTANT
DIRECTOR DANNY COLSON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING, I
KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE
FBI, YOU HOLD NEAR AND DEAR TO
YOUR HEART.
LISTEN TO THE FALLOUT HERE.
>> THIS NEVER WAS AN FBI
INVESTIGATION.
THIS IS A JAMES COMEY
INVESTIGATION.
HE HIJACKED THAT INVESTIGATION,
TOOK IT AWAY FROM FBI AGENTS IN
THE FIELD AND THEY ARE NOT
INFLUENCED BY PRESSURE, FEAR OR
POLITICS.
TOOK HIM TO HIS OWN OFFICE AND
NEVER LET THE FBI DO IT.
THAT'S VERY DISTURBING TO ME
THAT HE DID THAT.
THE FBI IS INTACT.
CHRISTOPHER WRAY DID A
MAGNIFICENT JOB TODAY PUTTING
THIS THING IN PERSPECTIVE.
THIS WASN'T AN FBI DEAL, THIS
WAS A JAMES COMEY DEAL WITH HIS
MINIONS THAT STOP TO INFLUENCE
AN INVESTIGATION.
>> WHAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND
WHEN AN EXCHANGE LIKE THIS
BETWEEN PETER STRZOK AND LISA
PAGE?
SHE SAID IN A TEXT MESSAGE,
TRUMP IS NOT EVER GOING TO
BECOME PRESIDENT, RIGHT?
RIGHT?
AND STRZOK SAYS, NO, HE IS NOT.
WE WILL STOP IT.
>> I THINK THEY DID STOP IT.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANIMUS IN
THOSE EMAILS AND THE BIAS, AND
THEN WHAT THEY DIDN'T DO, HOW
THEY CONDUCTED THIS WEEK AND
EFFECTIVE SOPHOMORIC
INVESTIGATION, THEY DIDN'T USE A
GRAND JURY, AND IT WAS CONDUCTED
BY PEOPLE AT A MUCH TOO HIGH
LEVEL.
THEY SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE FBI
FIELD AGENTS TO DO THAT.
THEY ARE TOUGHER AND HARDER AND
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICS.
>> Martha: THIS IS IN THE
REPORT THAT CAME OUT TODAY.
THEY SAID THAT WE FOUND THAT ONE
OF THE REASONS FOR NOT USING
GRAND JURY FOR TESTIMONY
INVOLVED CONCERNS ABOUT EXPOSING
GRAND JURORS TO CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION.
HOW DOES NOT WASH WITH YOU?
>> IT'S LAUGHABLE.
I DID IRAN-CONTRA, THAT INVOLVED
A LOT OF CLASSIFIED MATERIALS.
THAT'S A SPECIOUS ARGUMENT, AND
I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THAT.
THEY ALL LAUGHED AT IT, ALSO.
THERE IS A PROCESS, MEGAN, TO DO
THAT.
>> Martha: IT'S MARTHA, BUT
THAT'S OKAY.
>> I'M SORRY, THERE IS A PROCESS
AND THEY DIDN'T DO IT.
>> Martha: IS ALSO REALLY
STUCK OUT TO ME.
IN TERMS OF THE INTERVIEW THAT
THEY DID WITH HILLARY CLINTON AT
THE VERY END, THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL SAID WE FOUND
THAT BY THE DATE OF HER
INTERVIEW, THE MIDYEAR TEAM AND
JAMES COMEY DID NOT CONCLUDE
THAT THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTED
CRIMINAL CHARGES.
AND IN PARENTHESES, ABSENT A A
CONFESSION OR FALSE STATEMENT,
AND THE INTERVIEW HAD LITTLE
OUTCOME ON THE INVESTIGATION,
HOW CAN THAT BE?
>> IT CAN'T BE, IT SHOULDN'T BE.
I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BIAS
HERE.
THEY WERE BIASED TO COME UP TO A
CONCLUSION, AND I DON'T KNOW THE
ANSWER TO THAT.
BUT I KNOW THAT, IT'S NOT OUR
JOB TO MAKE IT PROSECUTED
SOLUTION.
YOU DON'T FORMULATE YOUR
INVESTIGATION BASED ON A
PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF INNOCENCE
OR GUILT, THAT'S WHERE THE FBI
OPERATES.
>> Martha: I THINK IT'S
INTERESTING BECAUSE MOST OF THE
HEADLINES COMING OUT OF THIS,
BUT I ACTUALLY STARTED READING
IT, HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE
THAT TAKE AWAY REALLY CAME FROM.
BUT CHRISTOPHER WRAY SPOKE ABOUT
THIS TODAY, LET'S PUT OF THIS
CHART THAT'S PART OF THE REPORT
THAT SHOWS THE PATTERN OF LEAKS
COMING OUT OF THE FBI.
SO OBVIOUSLY AT HOME, YOU CAN'T
REALLY GRAB THIS COMPLETELY.
THE LITTLE RED CIRCLES IN THE
MIDDLE ARE REPORTERS, AND THERE
ARE NUMBERS THAT EXTEND OUT
SHOWING THE NUMBER OF EXCHANGES
BETWEEN THE REPORTER AND PEOPLE
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEPUTY
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, THE STEPP
OPERATIONS SPECIALIST, THE
GENERAL ATTORNEY, ALL GOING TO
THIS REPORTER PERSON IN THE
MIDDLE AND THERE ARE THREE
DIFFERENT CIRCLES THAT SHOW ALL
OF THE MYRIAD OF CONTACTS THAT
WERE HAD.
IS THIS THE FBI THAT YOU KNOW?
>> NO IT'S NOT.
WE HAVE MEDIA PEOPLE, AND THEY
ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA AND
NETWORKS, OR WHOEVER.
IT'S NOT THE JOB OF A THOUSAND
PEOPLE IN THE FBI TO TALK TO THE
MEDIA, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LEAKS.
I THINK CHRISTOPHER WRAY ADDRESS
THAT TODAY.
THEY WILL DO A STUDY TO SEE WHAT
THEY SHOULD DO.
WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IS GO BACK
TO WHAT WE DID.
DON'T TALK TO THEM.
>> Martha: I KNOW FBI AGENTS
THAT I TRY TO GET STUFF OUT OF
AND THEY DON'T TALK TO ME.
BUT THERE ARE GOOD ONES OUT
