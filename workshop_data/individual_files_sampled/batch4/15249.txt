believe it or not a Tory MP just spoke some sense on the NHS suggesting we slashed the foreign aid budget to pay for it if you've been watching the news recently you will know that the government needs to raise twenty billion quid to put money into the NHS and given the huge population increases over the last few decades and specifically over the last year we know from a report I showed you guys the other day that 59% of the population increases because of immigration because of this huge surge of people the amount of people accessing the NHS has just driven the cost of it up and Theresa May says that we're going to be using the brexit dividend which is the money we save from brags at which despite what the left says does exist as she says we're gonna be using this brexit dividend to pay for it but in the meantime we've not even negotiated a full exit from the European Union so in the meantime she has to raise taxes to cover the cost and that's not going down all that well and you know it really bugs me because the NHS worked so fantastically well for such a long period of time but too many people are simply accessing it these days and if we can't do something about immigration if we can't do something about how many people are accessing the NHS we at least need to do something about how much we're paying and by the way actually it's not just about how many people access the NHS it's also about efficiency management costs the waste in the NHS is just insanely high and if we can't do anything about that then we at least need to look at how we're gonna pay for it and if that means slashing the foreign aid budget then so be it and that's exactly what a Tory MP has suggested Conservative MP Robert Hoffman told the Express that we should cut the foreign aid budget to pay for the NHS and the Daily Express reported that he said it will be utter madness to balance the new funding of the NHS on the backs of lower income working people and struggling families this is the regressive tax on the white van man and woman it will be much better to cut overseas aid rather than hit workers with a fuel duty rise this doesn't affect motorists but hits bus fares and food prices puts pressure on small businesses Theresa May said this government is on the side of workers but this is the wrong way to go about doing it so this MP Robert Half and has long been a leading campaigner for the fuel duty freeze so the plans by the government to hike fuel duty and hike taxes obviously haven't gone down well with him and it's always nice to see a burst of common sense from the House of Commons it's good to see a Tory MP standing up for the interests of the white van man which was traditionally the role of the Labour Party how the the times have changed a the Labour Party wants the working man's party and now despises the white working-class it despises the white van man it's always nice to see these bursts of sanity but I don't think anything's gonna change we know that the the foreign aid budget is completely out of control we're spending tens of billions every year on foreign aid I kid you not we once spent money on the Ethiopian Spice Girls so we're spent sending money to every country you can think of including places with dictatorial regimes it's utter madness so that's not gonna change anytime soon our government has no common sense of what we can assume is that the tax hikes are just going to go ahead if you like that and want to see more remember to like and subscribe or download the rebel at from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store
