but here's my real answer Poland and Austria 80 years ago they were the central focus of Hitler's Holocaust Austria was where Hitler was born it was the first country Hitler and next to Germany Poland was the country Germany first attacked militarily in September of 1939 and it was the place where the most Jews were murdered half of the entire Holocaust but incredibly if you believe that islamification is the greatest threat to Jews or other infidels and I put it to you that Poland and Austria I put it to you that they are the safest places for Jews and other infidels and by that I mean Christians - here's my proof yesterday this man won the Austrian elections sebastien curves just 31 years old makes 45 year old Justin Trudeau look like a fossil don't you think kurz is the leader of the Austrian People's Party and yesterday they got thirty 1.4 percent of the vote in that country's legislative elections another conservative party called the freedom party got 27 percent in the votive these stats have held together that's nearly 60 percent of the vote that's enormous the typical European socialist party the Social Democrats got just 25 26 percent in the vote these numbers are going up and down a little bit because of mail-in ballots the Greens they used to be the alternative party for many Europeans they were crushed down to just above 3% that's pretty much how bad Elizabeth May did no one cares about the environment anymore in you in Europe in the panic mode Islam and terrorism and the cyma fication and open borders you vote for the wind-turbine candidate when you don't care about things anymore it's a luxury when a million Muslim men marched across Europe many streaming through Austria either on route to Germany or to stop in Austria itself yeah there are more pressing things than wind turbines a majority of Austrians voted to reject the status quo the open borders the islamification of Austria Cruz's campaign was explicit he would close the borders and deport asylum seekers he doesn't use the word refugee because they're not refugees when you literally walk into Austria from Slovakia or Slovenia you're not a refugee Austria is the place where they've tried out swimming pool posters telling us the migrants hey don't rape our girls k yeah not a lot of success there then there was an Iraqi migrant who raped a ten year old boy and told the judge it was a sexual emergency so he just had to rape the boy yes I wonder why Austrians voted for kurz now it goes without saying that every single mainstream media outlet in the world is going to call kurz and his coalition partners far-right of course they are they would probably call that ten-year-old boy far-right if he complained about being raped in the swimming pool or women who still want to swim in a public pool at all without wearing a bikini but Austrians don't seem to care about what the BBC or the CBC or The Globe and Mail calls them they want to keep Austria free and Western call it Christian if you like they want to keep it Austrian and the poles want to keep Poland polish a view like that sign up for my show every day click on the screen to subscribe you
