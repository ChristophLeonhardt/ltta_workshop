1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,680
In a city packed with iconic skyscrapers,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,540
the Equitable Building, in the heart

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,660
of New York City's Financial District,

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,580
might not seem to stand out.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,760
But according to legend, this skyscraper

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,340
was once considered so
obscenely large that it led

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,060
to the first major zoning
law in the United States.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,680
And because of that law, it was

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,112
the last skyscraper of its kind.

10
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:26,612
(light contemporary orchestral music)

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,210
When it was completed in
1915, the Equitable Building

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,257
was the largest office
building in the world,

13
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:34,863
and an engineering marvel.

14
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:47,523
The building had one
problem: it was too big.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,920
Designed to maximize
rentable office space,

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,770
it was basically a 40-story H-shaped box

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,903
crammed onto an acre-sized city block.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,180
When it was built, New
Yorkers were in an uproar

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,890
over the "evil effect" of its size.

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,960
Neighbors complained
of the enormous shadow

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,110
that cast nearby buildings and streets

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,990
into complete darkness.

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,080
Meanwhile, developers worried that a glut

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,580
of these huge office buildings

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,173
would hurt real estate values.

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,920
At the time, New York had no laws

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,370
restricting the size or
height of office buildings.

28
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,740
But as new technology
was pushing skyscrapers

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,650
like the Equitable Building
to unprecedented scale,

30
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,270
the outcry for regulation
reached a breaking point.

31
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,180
Then, something happened.

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,050
Within a year a law was passed that

33
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,820
effectively made skyscrapers
like the Equitable Building

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,160
impossible to build again.

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,720
It was called the 1916 Zoning Resolution,

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,870
and it was the first
comprehensive zoning law

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,943
in the United States.

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,690
To be clear, the Equitable Building

39
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,230
didn't directly cause the
1916 Zoning Resolution.

40
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,050
It was simply the ultimate scapegoat

41
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,210
in a debate that had
been heating up for years

42
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,723
as new technology made
skyscrapers bigger and bigger.

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,250
Instead of enacting a fixed height limit,

44
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,800
like other cities had done,

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
the drafters of the resolution
developed an ingenious plan

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,919
based on something called
a setback principle.

47
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,439
Here's how it worked.

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,550
Depending on the district,
a building's height

49
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,200
could not exceed a certain ratio
to the width of the street.

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,610
In a 1 1/2 district, for example,

51
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,140
the maximum height was limited

52
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,683
to 1 1/2 times the street width.

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,160
A building could gain
extra height, however,

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,063
if it were set back from the street.

55
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,470
In a 1 1/2 district a building
could rise another three feet

56
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,083
for each foot that it was
set back from the street.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,340
Furthermore, in any
district, 25% of the lot

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,053
had no height limit at all.

59
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,470
Working within these constraints,

60
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,080
architects began to
creatively conform designs

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,340
in what became a characteristic style,

62
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,850
starting full width at street level

63
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,700
and tapering off in steps
as it rose in height.

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,030
And once you're aware of it you start

65
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,580
to see it throughout Manhattan.

66
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:03,080
(upbeat contemporary chamber music)

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,280
And the intended effect of

68
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,030
making New York's dense
streets seem more open,

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,680
for the most part actually works.

70
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,460
The Zoning Resolution went
beyond height limits too.

71
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,820
It also set rules for
how land could be used

72
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,850
in specific areas of the city,

73
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,970
such as prohibiting industrial work

74
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,920
in residential or business districts.

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,830
Around the same time,
other American cities

76
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,590
began to adopt similar zoning plans.

77
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,670
Six years later, Congress passed a law

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,050
based partly on New York City's example

79
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,993
as a blueprint for zoning nationwide.

80
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,960
By the 1960s, New York
had grown significantly,

81
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,820
and so the city passed a new resolution

82
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,290
modifying the setback principle

83
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,403
to accommodate for new building designs.

84
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,010
Meanwhile, the Equitable Building,

85
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,610
now a historic landmark and
undergoing a major renovation,

86
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,750
is a monument to a bygone era,

87
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,340
one whose excesses led to
New York's iconic skyline,

88
00:03:58,340 --> 00:00:00,000
which you'll never look
at the same way again.
