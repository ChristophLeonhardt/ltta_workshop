- Tax day is April 17th,
but the sooner you file,
the sooner you can get your tax refund.
The IRS actually recommends
that American tax payers
file their taxes online and they also say
you should request your
refunds via direct deposit.
So we decided to take a closer look at the
two most popular online tax filing systems
to see which one is better.
So I'm here with Anya who
beat us all to the punch
when it comes to doing your taxes.
She is a true early bird
and has already filled out
her tax return on not just
one online filing service,
but two and we're here
to find out which one
she liked better.
So what type of taxpayer
would you say you are?
I'm filing one income this year.
Last year, I was filing
two for my business insider
internship and from my freelancing gig.
So that was a little more complicated.
This year, I'd say I'm a much
more streamlined taxpayer
because I only have one
income to worry about
as opposed to two.
-  Why did you
use Turbo Tax last year and
are there certain taxpayers you think
that it might be better for?
- So last year I started
off using H&R Block.
It was going very well at first,
then when it came time to
file my freelancer income,
I found it much more complicated.
It was quite unclear how to move forward,
so I ended up going to Turbo Tax.
It was a breeze.
I just filed, you know, my
regular business insider income
and my freelancer income and
it was not an issue at all.
If you are somebody who has side projects,
side hustles, you're a freelancer,
Turbo Tax is probably better.
It really allows you
to skip back and forth
between different stages of the process.
Seems a bit more acclimated to people who
have multiple sources of income.
-  Which service was easier
to go through the process?
- So they were both very
similar in that they both had
very intuitive interfaces that kind of
keep the process flowing
and also answer questions
along the way as you're going through it.
I found H&R Block more streamlined,
a little bit more intuitive than Turbo Tax
but they're both pretty
similar in terms of
how you use them.
-  Which
one had something that
really stood out as a pain point?
Something that was kind of annoying.
- Turbo Tax because
they're very pushy about
trying to get you to upgrade
to their paid services.
They keep taking you back to the screen
where you're able to
select different options
and just basically asking are you sure
you want to do this for
free and it's kind of like,
yes, I am sure, and they basically
show you all your information saying,
we did your taxes last year.
You're 50% complete if
you upgrade to plus now.
And when I declined and went
to the free service instead,
it kind of makes a point of showing you
losing all your information
and I felt that was
a bit passive aggressive.
And it's a stark contrast to H&R Block
which was very much
easier to use in the sense
it doesn't make you set
up an account right away.
You can kind of go through it.
It does ask you if you want to upgrade,
but it just feels less insistent,
less, you know, making you
second guess yourself essentially.
-  What was
one of the major differences
you noticed between the
two different services?
- So, H&R Block's service
is incredibly linear
which I liked personally because it just
takes you from beginning to end
and it's a very straight
forward march to the end.
In terms of Turbo Tax,
it really allows you
to jump around more, I felt,
in terms of its interface.
You could start one thing,
leave it, go to something else.
That might appeal to
different personalities
based on how you like to work.
-  Given your experience,
which service would you
ultimately recommend?
- I'd say, if you're like me, and you are
filing for one income, both are good.
H&R Block, for me, was
better just in terms
of its interface and the way I was able to
kind of breeze through it essentially.
So if you don't have to worry about other
free lancing or side gig income,
I would say H&R Block is probably best.
- Okay cool, so H&R Block is your pick?
- Actually, this year
I'll be using Turbo Tax
to file my taxes.
- That seems like it goes against
what you just said though.
- Well, I already have
an account on there.
I'm all set up.
They have all my
information even though they
made a point of stripping it all away
when I didn't upgrade.
I'm used to it and they're
both so similar that
you now, I just feel like
might as well start an
ongoing relationship with one of them
as opposed to switching back and forth.
- That makes sense.
I mean it is nice when you
have all of your tax returns
in one place, but if you do
want to switch back and forth
every year, you can just download the PDF
and keep your own digital copy.
Thanks so much for doing your taxes early
so the rest of us could heed your advice.
- Thanks for having me. (laughing)
