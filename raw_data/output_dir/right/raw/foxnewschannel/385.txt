1
00:00:01,892 --> 00:00:02,592
THIS HOUR IN ROCHESTER,

2
00:00:02,593 --> 00:00:04,928
MINNESOTA, AND WE WILL GO RIGHT

3
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:06,696
TO IT IF NEWS HAPPENS, AND IT

4
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:06,996
MADE.

5
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:07,897
MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE PAST

6
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:11,301
THREE WEEKS, WE WATCHED

7
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,001
SLACK-JAWED AS A PROFESSIONAL

8
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,104
LAWMAKERS ATTACKED THE RULE OF

9
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:15,505
LAW.

10
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:16,840
WE HAVE HEARD SELF-DESCRIBED

11
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:18,108
ANTIRACISM ACTIVISTS EMBRACE

12
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:18,875
FULL THROATED RACISM ON

13
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:19,275
TELEVISION.

14
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:21,478
WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WHO CALL

15
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,779
THEMSELVES ADVOCATES FOR WOMEN

16
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,115
DESTROY THE LIFE OF AN ACTUAL

17
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:26,516
WOMAN FOR POLITICAL GAIN.

18
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:27,784
THE COUNTRY IS ALL BUT INVERTED

19
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:29,886
DURING THE DEBATE OVER BRETT

20
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:32,122
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION, IT IS

21
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:32,521
BEWILDERING.

22
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:34,057
IN CASE YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE

23
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:36,092
KEEPING TRACK OF IT ALL, A

24
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:39,095
REMINDER, IT WAS ONLY A WEEK AGO

25
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:42,732
THAT DEMOCRATS ARGUED A SECOND

26
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:43,366
SENATE HEARING INTO BRETT

27
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,501
KAVANAUGH'S HIGH SCHOOL RECORD

28
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,969
WAS NOT ENOUGH TO FIND THE

29
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,269
TRUTH.

30
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,173
WE NEEDED A SUPPLEMENT TERRY FBI

31
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:51,241
INVESTIGATION AND WE NEEDED IT

32
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:51,641
IMMEDIATELY.

33
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:55,645
>> THERE NEEDS TO BE AN FBI

34
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:56,079
INVESTIGATION.

35
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,149
>> THE FBI IS AN AGENCY OF SWORN

36
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,316
TRAINED LAW ENFORCEMENT

37
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:00,850
OFFICERS.

38
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:03,753
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO AN

39
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:04,187
INVESTIGATION.

40
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,824
>> AT THE INDEPENDENT

41
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:08,558
PROFESSIONALS OF THE FBI DO AN

42
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,425
INVESTIGATION.

43
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:14,497
>>   AN FBI INVESTIGATION IS THE

44
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:17,400
ONLY WAY TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE

45
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,901
QUESTIONS.

46
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:20,970
>> Tucker: IT ALWAYS STRUCK US

47
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,372
AS A MINDLESS DEMAND DESPITE ALL

48
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,241
THE HYSTERICAL DEMANDS FOR IT.

49
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:25,942
EVERYONE INVOLVED HAD ALREADY

50
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:29,879
GIVEN SWORN STATEMENTS UNDER THE

51
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,646
PENALTY OF PERJURY ABOUT WHAT

52
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,482
THEY KNEW FOR THIS STORY.

53
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,283
THE TWO PEOPLE AT THE VERY

54
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,686
CENTER THAT HAD ALREADY

55
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:37,854
TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS ON

56
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:38,254
TELEVISION.

57
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:39,288
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S LIFE HAD BEEN

58
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,891
THE SUBJECT OF SIX PREVIOUS FBI

59
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:42,892
PROBES, AND NOT ONLY WAS HE

60
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:44,894
CLEARED AND ALL SIX OF THEM, HE

61
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:46,596
WAS GIVEN ACCESS TO AMERICA'S

62
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:48,664
NUCLEAR CODES.

63
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:51,100
WE KNEW ALL WE WERE GOING TO

64
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,702
KNOW ABOUT AN EVENT THAT

65
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:53,970
SUPPOSEDLY TOOK PLACE 37 YEARS

66
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,438
AGO AND THAT'S WHY THE FBI SAID

67
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,307
IT HAD ZERO INTEREST IN GETTING

68
00:01:58,308 --> 00:01:58,774
INVOLVED AGAIN.

69
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:03,312
AND YET DEMOCRATS INVOLVED IN AK

70
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:03,646
AND YET DEMOCRATS INVOLVED IN AD

71
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:05,514
FOR A NEW INVESTIGATION AND THEN

72
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:06,682
PROTESTERS SCREAMED AT PORT JEFF

73
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:09,485
FLAKE IN AN ELEVATOR IN THE

74
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:11,087
SENATE UNTIL HE AGREED WITH THE

75
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:11,487
DEMOCRATS.

76
00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:12,688
SO WE GOT THE INVESTIGATION.

77
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,890
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE A WEEK

78
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:17,359
BUT IT WRAPPED UP IN SIX DAYS,

79
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,128
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO FIND.

80
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:19,829
ALMOST FOUR DECADES AFTER THE

81
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,898
FACT THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE

82
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,532
LEFT TO INTERVIEW.

83
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,502
NOT SURPRISINGLY IN THE END, THE

84
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:28,104
FBI DID NOT CORROBORATE

85
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,105
CHRISTINE FORD'S STORY.

86
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:31,841
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, DON'T

87
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:32,875
YOU?

88
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,910
THE FBI MUST BE INVOLVED IN A

89
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:35,277
COVER-UP.

90
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:37,113
A DIABOLICAL SECRET PLOT

91
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,881
ORCHESTRATED WITH THEIR VERY

92
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,282
CLOSE ALLIES IN THE TRUMP

93
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:41,117
ADMINISTRATION.

94
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,519
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TELLING US.

95
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
THE VERY PEOPLE WHO DAYS AGO

96
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:48,891
WERE TELLING US THAT THE IS A

97
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:52,495
IMPEACHABLE ORGANIZATION, A

98
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:53,295
TIEBREAKER.

99
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,497
BUT NOW THE FBI AS PART OF THE

100
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:55,898
DEEP STATE.

101
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:58,267
>> OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS VERY

102
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:58,601
LIMITED.

103
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:01,937
>> THIS REPORT IS BLATANTLY AND

104
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,305
CLEARLY INCOMPLETE.

105
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:06,242
>> OUR FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED.

106
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:09,511
THIS IS NOT A THOROUGH

107
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,112
INVESTIGATION.

108
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,747
>> IN YOUR VIEW IS THIS A

109
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:16,485
FULSOME AND EDIBLE

110
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:16,919
INVESTIGATION?

111
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,621
>> IT'S OBVIOUSLY A COVER-UP.

112
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:19,888
>> Tucker: OUR FEARS HAVE BEEN

113
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:20,289
REALIZED.

114
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,191
THE FBI IS WORKING WITH THE

115
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,258
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THEY

116
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:23,759
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

117
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,296
IT'S A PLOT SO SECRET, WE

118
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:28,297
BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE IS

119
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,298
HAPPENING.

120
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:30,866
HOW IS THAT FOR CLEVER?

121
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,502
OTHERS ON THE LEFT SAY NOW WHAT

122
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:34,937
WE REALLY NEED IS FOR BRETT

123
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:36,905
KAVANAUGH TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH

124
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:39,474
EXAM, BECAUSE THOSE ARE ACCEPTED

125
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:40,175
BY SCIENCE.

126
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:43,044
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM OF

127
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:44,579
SOUTH CAROLINA SAID THE

128
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,947
LIE DETECTOR WAS LIKELY THE

129
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:49,184
FIRST DEMAND IN A LONG LIST.

130
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:53,488
WATCH.

131
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,692
>> WANDA WEED DUNK IN THE WATER,

132
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:59,127
MAYBE YOU WILL BELIEVE HE LIED

133
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:00,929
ABOUT HOW MUCH HE DRANK IN

134
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,131
HIGH SCHOOL, THAT HE THREW ICE

135
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:06,535
AT A BAR, OR HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

136
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:09,404
TEMPERAMENT, THAT HE DOESN'T

137
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:12,240
HANDLE BEING DESTROYED WELL.

138
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:12,874
ENOUGH, ENOUGH ALREADY.

139
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,677
LET'S VOTE.

140
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:17,512
>> Tucker: WHY DON'T WE JUST

141
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:19,680
DUNK HIM IN WATER AND SEE IF HE

142
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:20,515
FLOATS?

143
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:25,520
IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH IN MEDIEVAL

144
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:25,854
FRANCE.

145
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:26,688
YOU KNOW ONE INVESTIGATION WILL

146
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,591
NEVER TRULY BE GOOD ENOUGH, AND

147
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:30,291
INVESTIGATION OF SOME KIND OR

148
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,126
DUNKING OF SOME KIND THAT LAST

149
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:32,827
THROUGH JANUARY 3RD OF 2019 AND

150
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:33,495
THAT'S WHEN THE NEW CONGRESS

151
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:37,899
WILL BE'S STOCK IN.

152
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,001
THAT'S THE REAL GOAL, OR IT HAS

153
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:40,301
BEEN.

154
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,138
WIN OR LOSE, HIS NOMINATION WILL

155
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,507
BE VOTED ON IT LOOKS LIKE IN A

156
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:45,874
FEW DAYS.

157
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,675
IT SEEMS LIKELY HE WILL BE

158
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:48,343
CONFIRMED BUT WE WON'T KNOW

159
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:51,880
UNTIL THE LAST VOTE IS CAST.

160
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:52,947
STILL, IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT

161
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:54,315
WHAT THE WORLD LOOKS LIKE ONCE

162
00:04:54,316 --> 00:05:01,089
THIS IS ALL OVER, AFTER

163
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,091
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION VOTE.

164
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,092
THE LEFT HAS ACCUSED

165
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:05,326
PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESIDENT TRUMP

166
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:06,427
OF OVERTURNING NORMS AND

167
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,597
DESTROYING INSTITUTIONS, BUT AS

168
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:11,699
ALWAYS, IT IS PURE PROJECTION.

169
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,767
WHATEVER THEY ARE ACCUSING YOU

170
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:15,503
OF IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE

171
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:15,903
DOING.

172
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:19,307
AND IT'S TRUE IN THIS CASE, TOO.

173
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:20,508
THE LEFT JUST MOUNTED A FULL

174
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,310
ASSAULT ON OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM.

175
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:24,111
THEY THOUGHT NOTHING OF TOSSING

176
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:25,313
OUT THE PRESUMPTION OF

177
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:25,713
INNOCENCE.

178
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:27,715
YOU SAW ACTUAL U.S. SENATORS SAY

179
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:29,517
THINGS LIKE, THE ACCUSED HAS AN

180
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:31,385
OBLIGATION TO PROVE HIMSELF AND

181
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:33,321
HIS THEY SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

182
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,122
THEN THEY TRY TO USE THE FBI AS

183
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:36,691
A WEAPON AGAINST THEIR POLITICAL

184
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,326
OPPONENTS, AND NOT FOR THE FIRST

185
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:39,327
TIME.

186
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,162
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO THE

187
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:42,330
SAME.

188
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,464
THINK THIS.

189
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:46,467
THINK AGAIN.

190
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:47,802

192
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,706
ALREADY LAYING GROUNDWORK TO

193
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:52,740
PACK THE COURTS, SOMETHING THAT

194
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:55,509
HASN'T BEEN TRIED SINCE THE

195
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,277
1930s.

196
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:57,011
ADDING MORE DEMOCRATS TO CHANGE

197
00:05:57,012 --> 00:06:01,315
THE BALANCE, THE SMALL

198
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:02,316
DEMOCRATIC OPTION AVAILABLE.

199
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:05,686
IT'S ONLY FAIR TO OFFSET THE

200
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:07,421
THEFT OF MAYOR GARLAND'S SEAT,

201
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:09,890
AND THE APPOINTMENT OF A TEENAGE

202
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:10,524
SEX OFFENDER.

203
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:13,227
GOING FORWARD, LOOK TO THE LEFT

204
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:15,896
TO DELEGITIMIZE ANY DECISIONS BY

00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,331
BRETT KAVANAUGH OF THE COURT OR

206
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:19,099
EVEN DECISIONS IN WHICH HE IS

207
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
THE MAJORITY.

208
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:21,468
SOME STATES MAY DECIDE TO IGNORE

209
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,905
THE SUPREME COURT.

210
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,507
DOES THAT SEEM FAR-FETCHED?

211
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:27,708
MAYBE NOT.

212
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:28,509
LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

213
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,910
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW.

214
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,411

215
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:32,713
LARGEST STATE IN THE UNION HAVE

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,521

220
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:42,089
CALIFORNIA IS, IN EFFECT, IN

221
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,858
OPEN REVOLT AGAINST THE LAWS OF

222
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,326
