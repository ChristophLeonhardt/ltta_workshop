a lot has happened over the last week and unfortunately we don't have time to get into the weeds but I do have time to tell you the parts that I find the most compelling or hilarious welcome to my favorite segment my favorite things first we head to Texas where senator Ted Cruz faces a challenge from Barrow or Roarke Barrow has become quite a rock star of the progressive movement both figuratively and also literally because I didn't know this until today he actually wasn't a band my favorite thing about Ted Cruz is watching him whine about all the positive attention pedos getting political rights Texas has Beatlemania Esquire says he could be the next Obama Vanity Fair calls him kennedy-esque their favorite adjective is chaos they all talk about his hair and his teeth they talk about no substance what a weird thing to fixate on Harrod teeth what is he a horse I keep waiting for Cruz to stomp his feet and start screaming why don't they talk about my hair and my teeth trust me Ted people have been talking about your physical appearance and based on what they say about you you shouldn't encourage them to compensate for his insecurities Cruz clings ever closer to his security blanket president Trump's pledge to campaign here is welcomed by Cruz who sees the President as the reason for the tight race with the election of Donald Trump the far left has lost their minds Cruz is mad that voters are energized after losing the presidency Ted you're from the freaking Tea Party the only reason why you're at office is because when Obama won your side went nuts also how exactly has the Left lost its mind is it because we support some form of single-payer health care if that makes us crazy then 70% of Americans have lost their minds is it because we support free college tuition if so then 63% of Americans have lost their minds hell as of a year ago more Republicans support free college that oppose it damn it seems to me the only person who has lost their mind is you you're clinging to Donald Trump a man who let's not forget called your dad an assassin and said your wife was ugly not just that but while you're crying about Beddoes teeth he doesn't even mention your name can do all of those things we're running not against anyone or anything or any other political party we're running for this country and I'm so excited to be a part of it Stephen Colbert shook betos hand Ted you've got to be pulling that hair out sorry didn't mean to say hair I know that that's your trigger word oh you know you want to see more videos like this just subscribe to the channel below and don't forget to become a TYT member and download the TYT Plus app on your phone head over to TYT dot-com / join today
