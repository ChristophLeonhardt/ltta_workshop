oh well hi there many Americans look at the pathological lies of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and we wonder quietly how we reach this point two words Barack Obama on Thursday the New York Times ran a puff piece on White House national security adviser Ben Rhodes he was the man in charge of selling the terrible Iran nuclear deal to the public and the Congress Rhodes whom The Times characterizes it as a quote aspiring novelist who ended up running Barack Obama's foreign policy he apparently brags openly about manipulating the press to live for the administration he spins fiction for the left The Times notes quote his lack of conventional real-world experience of the kind that normally precedes responsibility for the fate of nations like military or diplomatic service or even a master's degree in international relations rather than creative writing is still startling but why should it be creative fiction is the name of the game in the Obama administration as the time States quote when I asked Jon Favreau Obama's lead speech writer in the 2008 campaign a close friend of Ben Rhodes whether he or roads or the President had ever thought of their individual speeches and bits of policymaking as part of some larger restructuring of the American narrative he replied quote we saw that as our entire job entire job not telling the truth not crafting decent policy for the United States writing lies for the left and Ben Rhodes has helped The Times reports that Rhodes and his lackeys have quote become adept at ventriloquism many people at once turning them into their dummies according to The Times the entire administration narrative there's their whole story about the creation and content of the Iran deal it was constructed from whole cloth the fiction went something like this the Iranian selected a moderate Hassan rouhani over the hardliners rouhani wanted to make a deal to put aside a nuclear weapons plan and a historic deal was struck only one problem this was utter BS from the get-go as The Times reports quote the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran had become in mid-2012 many months before rouhani and the so-called moderates were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran's supreme leader the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei the idea that there was a reality in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration that's the New York Times reporting now it's truly incredible about all of this is not that the Obama administration lied and lied repeatedly and activated shows like Jeffrey Goldberg to market their lives and watched as the media parroted those lies over and over and over again what's astonishing is how brazen they are about this I mean they're openly telling the media about it Richard Nixon lied about Watergate turns out you should have just switched party registrations bragged about Watergate to all the friendly leftist outlets and then let them do all of his dirty work all of this bares trumpian and Clintonian fruit when nobody can be trusted to tell the truth the truth no longer matters when the media praised you for lying the truth no longer matters we have now entered the world of knights and knaves Knights who promise they are not knaves knaves who lie that they are not knaves so everybody's a knight except some are knaves when you can't tell the difference line becomes a simple mode of communication and then the only question is which person will lie the best for you Barack Obama perfected this world of lies now he brags about it to the very people he played for fools and they're happy to report all of it knowing that their own readers will continue to buy whatever line they choose to sell I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro she tends to demonize people just don't care about your feelings so good news over the weekend as I mentioned at the end of last week's broadcast on Thursday there was a good shot that there would be indeed another Shapiro child to add to my burgeoning Empire and indeed there is another Shapiro child to add to the burgeoning Empire and well it will announce his name later because Jewish tradition suggests you're not supposed to do it until after the circumcision which is supposed to take place this Saturday but he's a beautiful kid and and thank God I'll talk more about it later in the program cuz it was it was interesting and fun and and it's very exciting so we'll talk about more of that first all of the depressing things yeah that's what we do here in case you were wondering if I was gonna take time off from depression to be happy about my child you don't know me now well do you well okay so let's start today with there's an editorial by Bobby Jindal in the Wall Street Journal and the editorial by Bobby Jindal in the Wall Street Journal basically says that he's going to support Donald Trump what's amazing about this editorial by Bobby Jon is that he actually at the very beginning of it he sort of gets the story right he says that the never Trump movement they're trying to quote preserve a remnant of the conservative movement and its credibility which can then serve as a foundation for renewal and he says that this is he's sympathetic to the aim he feels sympathetic to this but he says the priorities are just too high he has to back the lying charlatan Donald Trump who by the way he called the madman in the primaries so now he's saying that madman must be elected for the good of the country and they're a bunch of people out there who are making the case that essentially you have to vote for Stalin to stop Hitler first of all nobody voted for Stalin to stop Hitler just historically speaking second of all to pretend that Trump would be Stalin in this scenario and Hillary would be Hitler in the scenario assumes a knowledge that is not in evidence in reality this is much more like 1933 when everybody knew the Communists were bad really really bad but they didn't know quite how bad Hitler was gonna be and so they backed Hitler in order to stop the Communists right that's actually a better historical parallel that's not saying that Trump is going to be Hitler only to say that you're assuming ever you're assuming knowledge not in evidence about the nature of Donald Trump it's also ignoring the fact that Stalin and Hitler were allies for most of the time and then only after Hitler attacked Stalin did open war break out between the two but before that they had been allies so if their allies were you really comfortable backing either of them the truth is the West was relatively split on the Hitler question all the way up until the time he attacked Poland because they saw Hitler as the guy who was going to stop Stalin so these historical analogies fail most of the time but this argument is is gaining credibility and on the left some nonetheless so many people saying let anybody who opposes Trump anybody who's not willing to get behind Donald Trump it's because they're not conservative enough clearly they don't want to stop Hillary enough quick note the argument that a vote not for Trump is a vote for Hillary is a stupid argument I'll tell you why in two sentences okay you ready for this it is not the same as voting for Hillary not to vote for Trump because it is not the SID because it is not the same thing as voting for Trump not to vote for Hillary all right am i voting for Hillary if I don't vote for Trump only if I'm not voting for Hillary either does that mean that's a vote for Trump doesn't work that way right a vote not for Trump is a vote not for Trump a vote not for Hillary's vote not for Hillary I'm not voting for either of them because I think they're both terrible okay but this is insufficient and one of the things that's that's maddening about this political debate is that now you know true conservatives there's their lesson there's two sides to this debate the on a side and the dishonest side the honest side is people who are actually conservative conservative arguing with each other over whether it is worthwhile to vote for Donald Trump as a short-term expedient but acknowledging that Donald Trump is not actually conservative right sort of what Bobby Jindal did today and I respect him for that know Bobby Jindal comes out and he says yeah you know I get he's not conservative but we sort of have to do what we have to do to stop Hillary okay respectable argument then there's the argument you're a bad conservative we don't even understand you're a bad conservative if you don't vote for Donald Trump and here's why this argument is stupid we'll start off with I think it's Kylie Mac Eleni who is a who's a Trump supporter on CNN with brian Stelter yesterday and she makes exactly this argument you're not properly conservative if you don't support Donald Trump in this election here's the thing Brian you are not a conservative if you do not support Donald Trump and it's crazy to me that I hear Ben and I hear Matt using conservatism as a shield there now all of a sudden concerned about conservative values well where were they with John McCain who was for cap-and-trade who was against the Bush tax cuts where was the never McCain movement where were they with with Mitt Romney who laid out the blueprint for Obamacare where were they leading the never Romney movement the fact are those movements didn't exist what you have going on here is an establishment and a establishment that is rejecting their voters that says we know better than our voters we see that embodied in Paul Ryan and we see the courage of leaders like John McCain and Mitch McConnell to come over and say you know what my voters are agreeing with where I stand and therefore it's time for the party to change rather than kicking out our voters this party would not exist abstinence voters and it's really irresponsible it's not conservative that's never Trump movement okay so there are a couple arguments that she's making there the first argument she's making is that there was no movement against McCain there was no movement against Romney I wrote about this back at very early in this election cycle when National Review Journal Goldberg at National Review who's a friend and somebody who I think is really good writer Jona wrote a piece talking about how he didn't want to be part of any movement that Trump was a part of on the basis of Trump is not a conservative Trump is for all the reasons that that I'm now on that type and what I said was my only problem with this argument was not what what Jonah was saying it's that there was no similar argument about Romney now I made that argument in 2012 about Romney I wrote a column called no on Mitt Romney in which I specifically said it's okay to be part of the Romney movement if you're going to call out Romney for not being conservative enough and say he's the lesser of two evils which by the way is an argument I make today although I will say the difference between Trump and Romney if that's not evident to anyone then you're I don't know what world you're living in both onion character terms and in terms of conservative policy everybody who's hit me you have Kylie McIlhenny they're ripping on Mitt Romney for Romney care Donald Trump has come out in favor of single-payer health care right I mean then he walks it back and walks it back forward again Donald's a she's ripping on on john mccain for not embracing the bush tax cuts yesterday donald trump came out will talk about this he came out and he reversed himself on tax cuts he says he now wants tax increases right there is no world in which donald trump is more conservative than John John McCain and Mitt Romney she can't make the argument the purity goes out the window just for your guy meaning that if the the idea that the purity weren't pure enough when you were when you were for McCain and Romney and therefore you have to stick by Trump that's like saying that there's no such thing as grades in school right nobody got in a therefore everybody got enough that's not true okay John McCain was not conservative enough I agree neither was Mitt Romney I agree Trump is leagues less conservative than either of them by far on virtually every issue he's less conservative than either of them so this argument fails on those grounds then you get the populist argument which is they're ignoring the will of the people again 42% of Republicans voted for Donald's from 58 percent voted not for Donald Trump and if we're going to talk about ignoring the will of the people it's the Trump supporters who are saying to all the Conservatives jump on the board jump on board or get out we're not even going to try and make overtures to you so here's the irony so you have this Trump supporter saying you're not conservative if you don't support a Democrat for the Republican nomination you're not conservative enough their own guy their own guy says that he's not conservative here's Donald Trump yesterday I have to stay true to my principles also and I'm a conservative but don't forget this is called the Republican Party is now called the conservative party you know there are conservative parties it's called the Republican Party I am a conservative no you're not no you're not the one thing that he said that's honest there is when he says I'm a Republican but there's a Republican Party but it's not a conservative party that's the whole argument right now that is the entire argument will it be a conservative party or will it not and the fact that he's calling himself a conservative demonstrates the kind of damage he's going to do to conservatism like if Trump came out he said look I'm not a conservative I'm gonna ad hoc populist you know I'm just like Dwight Eisenhower who's not particularly conservative I'm just a guy who makes policy based on what I think is right I'm not conservative not a Conservative Party even that I could respect more but the damage she's gonna do to conservatives based on him saying he's a conservative is really really problematic and when he says again it's the irony of a trump supporter saying you're not conservative if you don't support Trump and then Trump saying we're not a conservative party you can't have it both ways right you can't use an ideological litmus test for me not being conservative when your guy is out there saying we're not a conservative party and by the way you don't get to claim that I'm ideologically unable to to write Trump off when he did this over the weekend so here is Donald Trump and this again he's unacceptable as a conservative he's unacceptable as a president here is Donald Trump talking about taxes over the weekend I make deals I negotiate I put in a plan that has a massive massive debt bigger than any other candidate we have to negotiate with Congress you know I'm not gonna be able to say yeah like President Obama let's do an executive order okay it would be wonderful it'd be a lot easier but you just can't do it well you're not supposed to do it he may do something but and what he's done will probably many much of it will be overturned by the courts what I'm doing is I'm putting in a plan and that's my maximum plans well the bottom line do you want taxes on the wealthy to go up or down they will go up a little bit and they may go up you know but they're going down with a plan or knowing my plan they're going down but by the time it's negotiated they'll go up huh what's amazing about this is Donald Trump is the guy who says he wants to be unpredictable right he wants to be the guy who takes a negotiating position if I were negotiate with an employer and I were to say look I'm gonna give you a number I'm gonna give you a number my real number is like 35 $40,000 below that but I'm gonna give you a number you're just out publicly here's my number is 150 but I'm really willing to do it for a hundred what do you think the counter offers gonna be do you think the counteroffer is going to be a hundred or is the counteroffer gonna be fifty because they know I know my real numbers 100 right the idea that he's going out there and he's already pre negotiating the deal for Democrats right he's negotiating against himself supposedly unless he's really not negotiating against himself unless what he really believes is that taxes should go up on the wealthy this is the guy that I'm not a real conservative high if I don't support if a real conservative would support this guy here's Donald Trump on minimum wage yesterday I will I have seen what's going on and I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour now with that being said I would like to see an increase of some magnitude but I'd rather leave it to the states let the state's decide because don't forget the states have to compete with each other right you want so much of the federal government set a floor and then you let the state I would know I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do and the states compete with each other not only other countries but they compete with each other Chuck so I like the idea of let the state's decide but I think people should get more I think they're out there they're working it is a very low number you know with what's happened to the economy with what's happened to the course I mean it's just I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour but I would say let the state's decide it is a sowing coherent so it's super incoherence like saying you know I really think the partial-birth abortion should be banned across the country and there's already laws on the books dealing with this and I don't know how anybody could believe otherwise but what the states decide Donald Trump if you were an ideologically committed Federalist like Rick Perry was or Ted Cruz that's one thing but that was from is not an ideologically committed Federalist you gotta be kidding me Donald Trump is not a federalist in any sense Donald Trump is can he goes Federalist when it's convenient for him not to get in trouble for his big government ideas but the fact is that you know there would be pressure well do you does that sound like a man who would veto a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour does that sound because he's not gonna initiate the bill but does that sound like someone who'd veto it it would come on his desk and you say no we're leaving it to the states it has to remain at 7:25 does anybody really really does anyone believe that that was not his only economic illiterate illiterate moment of the weekend here's Donald Trump the man we must vote for because he is a conservative we've heard you know it's not it's not conservative not to vote for him here Donald Trump talking about our national debt which now stands at 19 trillion dollars here's Donald Trump people said I want to go and buy dad and default on debt and ever I mean these people are crazy this the United States government first of all you never have to default because you print the money I hate to tell you okay so there's never a default but but the point is I was reported in the New York Times indirectly you said you would go to creditors and make them take less sorted in the failing New York Times and other places that that I want to default on debt you know I'm the king of debt I understand that better than probably anybody I know how to I know how to deal with that so we're very well I love that but you know it's debt is tricky and it's dangerous and you have to be careful you have to know what you're doing but let me just tell you if there's a chance to buy back debt at a discount us in other words interest rates go up and the bonds go down right and by dad that's what I'm talking about people had it the times and others wrote Oh Trump wants to go with key creditors and buy debt at a disco now there could even be a time when somebody comes in but with the government they're never going to walk in and say do me a favor would you buy my debtor business discount in business that happens all the time I brought mortgages back when the market went bad I bought mortgages back at tremendous discounts and I loved doing that I mean there's nothing like it actually gives me a great thrill but in the United States with with bonds that won't happen because you know theory the market doesn't go down so that you default on debt and that's what happens so here's the story I'm sorry he's saying nonsense he's speaking nonsense language okay what he's talking about for people who are not financial experts is the way that this works is let's say that you default on a loan let's say that you can't pay the IRS certain amount they come in and they negotiate with you to take as much money as you have right as much money as you can pay them what he's saying and what he's been saying is well if there are countries that are with a we owe massive debt and we don't want to pay them back well go to them and we'll say to them we may owe you $100 but we're gonna give you 80 so you take it or you leave it because maybe we'll go bankrupt and you'll bet you'll be paid nothing or maybe we'll inflate our way out of it and we'll pay and we'll pay less right and then he says oh no I never said that I said what I really mean is that we can always just inflate our way out of it which is a way of paying back discounted debt if you print if I owe you if I owe you $100 and I say to you okay here's two choices you're gonna take $80 or I'm gonna go in my back room I'm gonna print out a stack of money and I'm gonna hand it to you it's not worth anything but I'm gonna hand it to you and it'll say a hundred on it right that's a way of negotiating down your debt he does want to negotiate down the debt or he wants to inflate our way out of it the idea we're gonna inflate our way out of a 19 trillion dollar debt if you like what's happening in Venezuela where nobody has any money or life savings are now with zero if you like what happened in the biome our republic where people are pushing around wheelbarrows full of cash money in order to get loads of bread then you'll love Donald Trump's economic plan this is such utter insane idiocy I mean really is nut stuff we should default on our current we should default on our debt we should inflate our currency I mean this is this is this is economic illiteracy at its finest there are a lot of people who believe that it was inflation was our sort of inflationary monetary policy that led to the Great Depression and then tariffs that exacerbated it and higher taxes Trump wants to do all three of those things he wants to inflate the currency he wants to increase the tariffs and he wants to make sure that the rich are paying more in taxes so Donald Trump making depressions great again right this is this is his new this is a new campaign slogan but remember if we don't vote for Donald Trump we're not sufficiently conservative now the question becomes who do we blame for Donald Trump do we blame Trump do we blame the media do we and I think there's a lot of people who have a lot of blame but there was an interesting argument made by Matthew Dowd I don't normally like Matthew daddies on ABC news and he's a commentator kind of a left-leaning republican commentator and he says that the real problem when you get right down to it is Trump's voters know that in the end people did vote for him and you have to blame the voters for some of this is an argument that I want to talk about for just a moment here's Matthew Dowd making that case on ABC News yesterday speaker Ryan for defying Trump says Ryan motivated by 2020 white house ambitions kind of a declaration of war right there so can this breach be healed does it have to be healed well I think they actually the breach isn't between fundamentally between some levels of GOP elite and Donald Trump the breach is between various members of the elite and the GOP voters I think the problem for the GOP elite right now is the GOP voters have basically spoken and that Trump represents their party and I think Paul Ryan and others in the party have to decide if the Republican Party as it is today represented by Donald Trump is their party anymore it Donald Trump isn't the problem for the GOP elite the Republican voters of the problem for this okay so he says the voters in the end are the ones who are who are responsible for this first of all 42% of the voters are but what's fascinating is that I've been hearing from all sides all sides you see people like Ross dude had has said this over at the New York Times Andrew Klavan has said this on his show Lichter says that a lot of people saying this this is the new popular line peggy noonan Aceves does the Republican Party ignored its white working-class base a Republican Party ignored its white working-class base so this leads me to a question what should they have been doing that they didn't do what should they even doing that they didn't do so here you know Mitt Romney he just talked about globalization but he never talked about the impact of globalization on these impoverished communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania these kind of white impoverished manufacturing communities what is he supposed to do really like this is the main question and I and I hear job-training the government has never had a good job training program there's never been anybody who was trained for a job by the government and then went out and just got that job in the private sector the truth is most people almost everyone was hired either with or without a skill set and learns the job on the job that's that's usually how people learn how to do jobs so this idea the government has some sort of magical training program similar to turn some guy who does rivets into a computer engineer it's absolute nonsense it's just not true and if you offer some fifty five-year-old guy who's been working at a car factory his entire life oh now we're gonna send you to Seattle and you're gonna and you're going to learn how to work at Microsoft he's gonna look at you like you're not what you are because that's silly okay so what what what a Republicans supposed to do presumably they're supposed to lie to people presumably they're supposed to tell them that government is the solution that they can do something for them the way the Democrats do they should treat white working-class voters the same way the Democrat treats black treat black working class and unemployed voters and say we're going to either give you money or we're going to create tariffs that bring your industry back which will not happen by the way or we're going we're going to somehow help you specifically I'm gonna do for you what we do for the ethanol guys Iowa but with the farmers in Iowa and this to me is dishonest Republicans can lie they can we can lie to white working-class voters we can tell them that that free trade is bad and that we need to protect these industries and that your job is gonna come back if we somehow keep out world competition and if we impoverished consumers in the United States we can tell you those wise we can we can do that or we can recognize that this three-legged stool that so many Republicans are throwing out that was the reason white working-class voters voted Republican in the first place so let's take a quick trip through history so the idea is the white working-class voters they abandon the Republican Party when Republicans started going in favor of free trade that it was NAFTA that really did it that was NAFTA and all the outsourcing and a world economy that was free even though NAFTA and a freer world economy led to massively increased standards of living okay that's that's the argument that the Republicans lost those votes the reality is that white working-class voters always always could get more stuff from the government if they voted for Democrats so why did they vote for Republicans but everybody gets more stuff more free stuff unless you're an earner if you vote for Democrats so why did these people vote for Republicans there's a book by a guy named Thomas Frank his leftist called what's the matter with Kansas and this was sort of the question why is the Kansas is Republican when it has so many downtrodden white voters who could get more from the government what's driving them and what he found is what's driving these people are two other issues that have nothing to do with economics one is foreign policy who are the bad guys and how are we gonna fight them and two is Social Policy right I don't want my daughter having to shower with a boy I don't think that my shop should be forced to perform a gay marriage or participate in the same-sex wedding I don't think it's okay for a mother to murder her baby at nine months or for a doctor to go in and murder the baby for the mother at nine months right this is it that it was social issues it was priorities other than the government is going to save my job that led to these white working-class voters embracing the Republican Party now we've got trumpism for a second trumpism is being a Democrat he's now going to these people he's saying we're not gonna talk social policy ever social policies off the table Donald Trump is not a pro-life guy he doesn't know anything about the pro-life position he's certainly not aren't only pro-life and he doesn't talk about it certainly not anti same-sex marriage even though he says he is everybody knows that he's lying about it the same way Obama did when he talks about men going into women's bathrooms he said that it's silly for people not to allow this and he said he would allow it at Trump Tower right so so Donald Trump has taken the social issues off the table just the way the establishment wings the coast say that we should are taking these issues off the table just like the Romney campaign the Romney campaign boiled down to economics and you lost by five million votes and all these white working-class voters stayed home they didn't like him right talking about the very economic issues people on the coast said that they loved Donald Trump also takes foreign policy off the table so he says yeah Isis is bad we'll bomb the hell out of them but I don't really have a plan for them and anyways our resources are being expended in the Middle East let's just bring all that stuff home so he takes foreign policy off the table and Social Policy off the table all that leaves is economic if it comes down to economics these white working-class voters want to be lied to right because everybody wants to be lied to in the end it's not unique to white working-class voters it's true for everyone everyone who wants stuff from the government wants to be lied to that mommy and daddy are the government and they're going to take care of us and they're gonna fix all of our problems the Reagan stool was a bargain it was a bargain position okay those of us who are quote unquote true cons are at the true conservatives the people who believe that there are standards for conservatism the rare ones who agree with all three planks of the of the stool all three legs of the stool I'm a social conservative I believe in a in a strong hawkish foreign policy and I believe in a free economy right I'm one of the rarities who believes these three things the reasons Republicans were able to win was not because most people believed in all three of these things is because most of these people believed in two of the three most of the people believed in two of the three right so they're people on the coasts who didn't believe in Republican social policy but they agreed hawkish foreign policy and decent free economics there were people in the middle of the country who belives hawkish foreign policy and social conservative right there were people who believed and and and so the and so those were the those were the options right they believe two of the three they believe two of the three people who ignored social conservatism there are the people who ignored the the foreign policy conservatism there are the libertarians or the religious conservatives who didn't like what's going on in foreign policy but they like free account of free economics and they also like the social policy those people are a little bit rarer kind of isolation those are rare so the idea was that basically bargains are cut by finding people who believe in most of your platform but not all of your platform when you remove planks from your platform folks when you take legs off of the stool there's no place for coalition politics anymore there's no place for it so Donald Trump is building a new coalition the new coalition is people for for big government involvement in the economy people who don't care about social policy and people who are isolationist on foreign policy so basically the only difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on policy anyway is that Donald Trump is more isolationist on foreign policy than she is and that she will be more active in some of these other spheres than he will but they basically believe the same things he's just more isolationist and he's gonna run from her left right so that's sort of the idea here does that sound like enough to build a winning coalition does that sound like a conservative coalition to you so this is why when people say oh the Republicans need to reach out to the white working-class voters I agree but not on the basis of handouts on the basis of there's still principles worth conserving in your community your church your family there's still enemies to fight abroad it's not just about isolationism bring our boys home stuff and if you dump all that then you're gonna end up with a pretty small coalition indeed and the only way to appeal to these swing voters is to hand them stuff from the government you might as well run the Democrat okay all of this said Donald Trump continues his battle in the media and he continues his battle versus Hillary Clinton so Donald Trump as I've said for a long time he's really good at a couple of things one of the things he's good at is manipulating the media he's very very good at manipulating the media but I think it's important for his followers to note that when he's picking fights with people he's doing it III don't fully believe him here I think that Donald Trump in the end says he's an entertainer I think Donald Trump is personally offended and then he hides behind I'm an entertainer in order to cover his personal offense right just the way that Jon Stewart is a leftist and then he uses comedy as his sort of clown nose on routine oh I was just joking that's what I do around here Stephen Colbert does the same thing Trump does that with being an entertainer when he says something rude or something terrible he says all I'm just being an entertainer that's what I do I'm just an entertainer guys and then when it comes to when it comes to policy then he says well the media is out to get me so here's Donald Trump going after going after CNN and and he says that he doesn't understand why they're not congratulating him for his deal this is a nice way to start off the interview first of all you should congratulate me for having won the race I thought you know at least it'd be a small congratulations but I'm not surprised with CNN because that's the way they treat Trump it's the you know they call it the Clinton Network and I believe that so you know let me hold on I did congratulate you the last time we spoke I said congratulations on winning race thank you very much but you made that no no no no hold on hold on let's get this off on the right foot I'm trying to address what you using with a question we haven't spoken last week toward the end I was the essentially the nominee of the party and you start off with this question which is not surprising because I understand you thinks a lot better than you do okay okay let's let's you know what you're right sometimes it's good to restart here's the restart okay and then he and may goes along with it which is ridiculous I mean that the help how does it go with that it's not pathetic so Trump does this routine and his followers go yeah he's hitting CNN they are the Clinton News Network and they are and they are does Trump actually believe this or is he just faking it is he just doing this for the for the entertainment value is he doing it to appear strong he does appear stronger than Cuomo or because he won't let go of it what Cuomo should have said is look I'm the guy who asks the questions you don't get to tell me what to ask if you don't like it right and just hang up on him and see what he does about it right that's the there's no reason he doesn't have to offer him congratulations what is he yeah this is kneel before Zod kind of stuff right it really is and he doesn't have to kneel before Zod I think it's funny I think most people who are conservative think it's funny because CNN deserves everything he gets at the hands of Donald Trump although the truth is if Fox News does too at this point Donald Trump was was you know he always had a major battle with megyn kelly and and so megyn kelly has now revealed a little bit of her interview with Donald Trump this will be a clip ten and and she says that um and and you'll see what what they say to each other tend of interesting you seem to stay angry for months you know was that real or was that strategy well I'm a real person I don't say oh gee I'm angry tonight but tomorrow you're my best friend see I do I do have a theory that you know when somebody does it and this could happen again with us I mean it could be even doing this particular interview I have great respect for you that you were able to call me and say let's get together and let's talk to me I would not have done that the orange God King speaks Trump of orange and and I love this he says he would go on in that same interview by the way to talk about well actually you'll see you'll see so he says so right there you see him he's such a liar he says he says I'm not the kind of guy who says I'm angry in the night and then in the morning I say you're terrific okay cut to Donald Trump talking about how megyn kelly is terrific here we go you know Hillary Clinton the only thing she's got going she plays the woman card a hundred percent I saw her in a speech well Donald Trump spoke a little bit harshly to make and Kelly well megyn kelly was really terrific she called me and came up to my house she wanted to make peace and we did we did I mean it was very nice some of the stuff has said as as you know an entertainer because I have the apprentice or some of it was said in fun with certain shows like Howard Stern was a friend of mine and I'll tell you well you're not worried about the tapes of that coming back it comes back I mean look what am I gonna do everyone else thinks it everybody else thinks it everything that he said about women being flat-chested not being tens and women who and women should be treated like crap and and megyn kelly bleeding from her wherever everybody thinks this stuff he's just the only one who says it and he's an entertainer so he can't blame him I mean he's an entertainer come on guys he's an entertainer but this is the this is the beauty of being Trump when it comes to the media which is an entertainment business he can hide behind the ayman entertainment spiel I'm an entertainer spiel to say really quite terrible things and even get away with stupidities like this so there's an evangelical leader named Russell Moore and Russell Moore has come out very very strong against Donald Trump and and Russell Moore had tweeted that he didn't think the Trump was a good candidate and Donald Trump tweeted back at him there's a major evangelical leader Russell Moore is a truly terrible representative of evangelicals really this is what he tweeted Russell Moore is a truly terrible representative of evangelicals and of all the good they stand for a nasty guy with no heart a nasty guy with no heart he's talking about Russell Moore we're also more by the way has spent most of his career talking about the decency of interracial adoption but he's a nasty guy with no heart so he tweeted back sad right and then Instagram to the caption 1 Kings 18 17 to 19 and what that says is quote when he saw Elijah he said to him is that you you troubler of Israel the verse reads I have not made trouble for Israel lied to replied but you and your father's family have you have abandoned the Lord's commands and have followed the Baals resum were treated back to Donald Trump is it just entertainment or is it real is it just you know you can play this game as much as you want guys is this entertainment or is it real when he's the President of the United States you're not gonna get a chance to play that game anymore because he has the power of the presidency behind him it's all fun and games with this entertainer stick until it turns out that he's not actually being entertaining he's being real and it turns out that he's gonna go after members of the media he disagrees with and target them and then he's going to try and change the law of the First Amendment to allow him to personally supy pilatus agrees it's all fun and games until he actually has power right now she's the candidate he's got no power you can say whatever he wants but this whole whenever I say anything that's unpleasant I'm an entertainer and whenever I say anything that's not unpleasant that's me being presidential and it's not gonna wash when he has power all of that said Trump could still beat Hillary because Hillary is so terrible at all of this Hillary is she doesn't know how to handle Trump in any way so here is Hillary trying to fly above all of this Donald Trump just doesn't understand how government works and you combine that with a lot of what he has said about foreign policy and then recently economic policy when he said he'd renegotiate the national debt maybe he just doesn't understand that running our government is not the same as making real-estate deals that putting the Full Faith and Credit of the United States of America at risk would be a horrible outcome and it would raise interest rates it would wipe away savings it would cause a financial global meltdown people need to be pressing him and I I don't think people get especially in the media at least so far into other than just the the response which then is not followed up on okay so she says that no one ever follows up with him on what he's saying his nonsense all of this is true all of this is true right and it makes her look reasonable except that she's terrible with this first of all folks you should subscribe so you can see all of these clips because when I comment on what people look like I just want you to know how accurate I'm being I don't know who did her makeup here she looks like she died four days ago and now they've made her up they did some injections in her face and they made her up and she looks like what a person looks like when they're in the coffin and people are walking by oh she just she looked so beautiful she looks like she's asleep and she's and she's been dead for three days I mean she's got on the full pancake makeup here she doesn't look good and so she's doing this kind of robotic Trump doesn't understand government routine which is true and then here is Donald Trump responding to Hillary Clinton and it's just this is how he responds you took a small amount of the speech and you build it up like it's the biggest thing in the world but it is a big thing Hey look he was the worst abuser of women you just said I'm making too much of it now you say it's a big thing as a politician in the history of our country he was impeached he was impeached and then he lied about it he said nothing happened with Monica Lewinsky and then he said sorry folks it actually did happen and the guy was impeached for lying okay so you got Hillary Clinton saying he's bad at government and he comes back with your husband was impeached for lying okay which one do you think is gonna make the headlines which one do you think is gonna earn the media coverage which one do you think is gonna actually work with the public again he's this was always the prediction with Trump the one good thing about Trump as a candidate is he's so out of the box that he can hit her with anything I mean he's gonna I don't know that I've told this story on the air before but I can tell it because this is basically this campaign when I was at Harvard Law School we used to play poker and we'd have a poker night and one of the fellows who came and played poker was a very weird dude a very weird guy I won't give his name because this is probably criminal and he and he he would you know he would talk about how he dropped acid and he very very weird dude and so we're sitting there and we're talking one day and he talked about how he's been meeting girls on Craigslist now for folks who have kids in the car you might want to pause it here we'll pick it up again in two minutes so he says me and girls on Craigslist and and so somebody said oh what's that like as well he got some weird people you know there's one girl she came over to my place and we were going at it and she and she started saying to me I want you to hit me and he said I didn't know what to do and I didn't know what to do and she just kept saying hit me and he said know what to do and she just kept saying hit me and so I just grabbed a toaster and hit her with it that's the Donald Trump campaign right there I mean Hillary Clinton's daresay and hit me basically and he's grabbing a toaster and he's quiet and it's really you know it's maybe it'll work maybe it won't but but it sure is entertaining no one ever said the end of the world was going to was going to be boring so okay Hillary Clinton by the way still saying the Republicans are reaching out to her campaign I I don't believe there very many Republicans reaching out to her campaign and this is a good place to point out once again being anti Trump does not mean being Pro Hillary as I've said before in a race between Satan and the Antichrist I vote neither and so that's the way it is okay let's talk about one other aspect of the Hillary versus Trump race and this is I think a disturbing point in American politics lady gaga has now come out and she has tweeted this that you create this for Mother's Day happy Mother's Day Hillary Clinton this country needs a mother and you're it hashtag Hillary be our momma so know the country does not need a mother no the country does not need daddy it doesn't need a father and all of you Trump us to our core going around proclaiming that Trump is your father you're a sad little person if you believe that you need a politician to be your daddy you know if your daddy abandoned you and now you're looking for a father and a guy who has created an abandon many of his own children I don't think that you're looking in the right place for love you want to know where fascism comes from you know what if your kind of language comes from it comes from a group of people who don't believe in Family Values who don't actually have parents this idea that you need a mother in the form of Hillary Clinton because you didn't have a mother of your own I don't need a father a politician I have a dad I don't need a mother politician I have a mom and and this is this is where the disturbing kind of fascistic American political system is going okay final note here one of the reasons that Trump is seeing so much success is that is that the Obama administration has sort of created Trump I mentioned this up top that the Obama administration's lies in their prevarications they've created trumpism more evidence of that over the weekend John Kerry the Secretary of State he says that it's a commencement address he says it's time to prepare for a world without borders there are no walls big enough to stop people from anywhere tens of thousand miles away who are determined to take their own lives while they target others not in a clash of civilizations but in an assault a raw assault on civilization itself so I think that everything that we've lived and learned tells us that we will never come out on top if we accept advice from soundbite salesmen and carnival barkers who pretend the most powerful country on earth can remain great by looking inward and hiding behind walls at a time that technology has made that impossible to do and unwise to even attempt ok the hard demands ok so the idea of a borderless world this one world motion pushed by the left is wrong and scary what is also wrong and scary is the idea that America should be completely insular that we should have no trade with other countries that we shouldn't have commerce with other countries that we can be non involved in the world and that we can remove ourselves from the international sphere and things will be ok that is also wrong and scary you've got the extreme manifestations on this score right you've got the the fun of the European far-right saying nobody gets in nobody gets out maybe got people on the extreme far left saying everybody gets in every and basically everybody gets into no one gets out is it sort of the the extreme far left statement because if everybody gets in there's no place for anybody else to be so it's the the carry ism creates the reaction of trumpism so trumpism isn't coming from nowhere but it certainly isn't coming from a conservative place to come full circle on this topic it's not coming from a place of true conservatives have to side behind Trump because he's a conservative guy it's coming from a reactionary thing to the left and them saying okay well we're still reacting against the left why don't you side with us and the answer is because a lot of what you represent is still the left and lot of what you represent is still bad just because your aunt the the friend of my friend is not necessarily the the the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend sometimes the enemy of my enemy is also another enemy right it's possible the enemy of your enemy can also be another enemy there's more than two sides in this particular political debate when it comes to the Constitution the Constitution has two enemies running for higher office at this point okay time for a couple of things that I like and then a couple of things that I hate really quickly so things that I like I've just started a book by a historian and Mary beard SPQR a history of ancient Rome and I had a little light reading to do while my wife was was taking a nap from being in labor so I started this one I thought the labor was gonna be a little longer than it was to be honest with you and so this is like a 600 page book and I over prepare when I when I go for these things so I had brought like five books thank God it was a short labor in my a relatively short labor and my wife's water broke like 12:30 at night we go into the hospital and and then nothing was happening so they had to give her some pitocin to push it forward and from there moved very quickly and babies born all healthy great I have to tell you that not only do I love the new baby the the the first kid my firt my daughter is just the greatest kid who ever was she is so sweet and she is so wonderful and my parents brought her to visit us in the hospital as her staying over obviously with the new baby and my parents brought her to visit and we'd been preparing her for a while that the new baby was coming and so when she came in we did what they say are supposed to do we sort of put the new baby in the bassinet and we let her interact with us as though nothing were going on and let her kind of express her own interest as to the new baby instead of making her feel kind of left out by here's the new baby and we're really excited about it so she comes in and she and she sits and she sits on the bed and we're reading books to her and she says where's the baby because my parents had told her there was a new baby and she's really little she's like - she's two years and maybe three months and January 20th 2014 so whatever that is and she and she in so she says where's the baby and so we pick her up and she looks at the baby and she gets the most contemplative sad look on her face like everything just change and you can see the wheels turning and it was just she it's very quiet and just stares at him and kind of taking it in my wife started crying it was really sad it's like it is when you have a new baby it's especially a second baby I mean these are things I'm just learning cuz they're happening to me now but when you have a second baby I obviously very happy but it's also a little sad because you're moving beyond a certain life point just the same way that it's probably sad I didn't really feel very sad we had our first kid but there is a feeling like you're moving beyond your single days and now life is gonna change and when you have the one child and all your focus is on the one child now you're moving to to it it's hard not to feel like you're abandoning the first one a little bit but you're not and so it's and so the next day we brought the baby home or later that afternoon actually yes yesterday Freeman brought the baby home and by that point she walks out and she got curious about the baby and now she's just walking around the house kind of strutting around the house going he's little I'm big I'm a big sister he's my little brother it's it's just adorable it's too much it's too much fun also know my wife is awesome she's she's awesome at this and awesome at everything she's she's terrific and the funniest thing ever I was wearing you know this heaven middle of the night so I'm just wearing like a t-shirt and when we go into the hospital and I was wearing a t-shirt a Batman t-shirt it's like a comic Batman a graphic t-shirt and and so it shows him kind of like making a musky any screaming he's like full-out screaming she's a a like big scream and so my wife halfway through the labor she says this is the greatest labor shirt ever and I get like she's using it as the focal point when she was going through labor and going through the contractions it's like a personal trainer like she's looking at Batman yelling at her to toughen up and just do it like he's going through it I'm going through he's just like me me and Batman very funny so thank God everybody is doing really well but the brisk the the breat me law the circumcision will take place on Saturday and we're very excited about all that okay a quick thing that that I hate so the the federal government is now going after the state of North Carolina because they think that the boys should be able to pee next to girls and the men should be able to pee next to women and one of the stupider arguments that I've heard is the argument you're about to hear right here from Chris Wallace at Fox News this is to the North Carolina's governor all of this is happening of in North Carolina Pat McCrory's the name of the governor and he's the one who signed into law this statewide bill that says that local municipalities cannot force businesses to let transgender men men who think they're women into into women's bathrooms and here's chris wallace grilling him on it how many cases how many cases have you had in North Carolina in the last year where people have been convicted of using transgender protections to commit crimes and bathrooms this wasn't a problem that's the point I make and this is the Democratic Party in the left wing of the Democratic Party have there been any cases of not that I'm aware of how different any cases in the last five years why did the Democratic Party in Houston Texas but I guess the question is but forgive me if I may sir why not just then let it go if there's if there's not a case of transgender people going in and molesting little girls I I haven't used that at all this is an issue of expertise a girl going into a girl's bath that's where there's an expectation of privacy when you go into a restroom or your wife goes into a restroom you assume the elder people going to that restroom or shower facility is going to be a person of the same gender that's been an expectation of privacy that all of us there's no problem then why pass the lawnmower blades there can be a problem because the the Liberal Democrats are the ones pushing for bathroom laws and now President Obama and one of my successors is Mayor Charlotte once government to have bathroom rules I'm not interested in that we did not start this on the right who started it was the the political left in Houston Texas then Charlotte North Carolina now frankly in Washington DC okay so here's the part of this that's so stupid you've got all these people on the left they're saying when's the last time a transgender man went into a women's restroom and harassed a woman the answer is not often because men are not allowed in women's bathrooms right you see how this works if there's a law against beating puppies to death it turns out that if you remove that law from the books and then you say well have we had a lot of cases have we had a lot of cases of people beating puppies up the tire irons have you seen a lot of that why don't you get rid of oh why don't you get rid of it I mean come on right because we have a law that you're not supposed to do that so we can punish you for doing that right you see how this works it's amazing right dealing drugs when's the last time you saw somebody deal drugs to a child like right in your neighborhood ones less he'll get rid of the policing get rid of the policing cuz it doesn't happen in your neighborhood cuz they're puzzled because there's policing and when's the last time someone was murdered in your neighborhood so get rid of the laws on murder cuz it never happens come on right cuz there's a law against my mean this is the stupidest idea it's legitimately the stupidest argument ever this argument like it doesn't happen off and therefore there shouldn't be a law against it maybe there's an it's not happening because men don't go into women's bathrooms because if that happened someone would report them to the police whereas now we're going to add this to the new regime of political correctness where a man walks into a bathroom and my wife has to consider am I going to be socially sanctioned if I go outside and I say to a police officer there's a man in the bathroom and then he comes out and says no I'm a woman I'm a woman let me tell you right is now she's now she's a bigot now she's a bigot it turns out that I don't need my wife to be molested by a man's you know that I don't want a man in the bathroom with her okay this is ridiculous this is all ridiculous it's if you go back historically by the way one of the original arguments against the Equal Rights Amendment which was a there was an attempt to make a constitutional amendment that said that men and women can there can't be any discrimination on the basis of sex not an employment but just generally no law can treat men and women differently and Phyllis Schlafly who's at that time the leader of the anti er a movement the Equal Rights Amendment woman she said what's gonna happen is they're gonna get rid of separate genders in the bathrooms in the bathrooms this is what was her case then no we'll never do that no oh well never yep they're liars they're liars so and and here's my final parting question on this why am I supposed to feel safer with a mentally ill man in the bathroom with my wife and with a mentally whole man in the bathroom with my wife there's a guy in there he's dressed in a dress he's got a moustache am I supposed to feel safer now that he's wearing a dress in the bathroom with my wife then if he was wearing pants like what why and what kind of clothes suffice what if he's wearing a women's pantsuit what then you know that this whole thing is ridiculous but for the left the the idea is is the destruction of the is the destruction of sex and gender in order so they couldn't create their their more equal world where no categories exist well the categories do exist it turns out quick note on on the transgenderism issue I watched my wife push a baby out of her 36 hours ago yeah women are different than men yeah they are and you're all stupid you're all real dumb okay you people are out of your damn minds not the transgender folks who actually have mental illness but you people who are pushing the idea men and women are the same you are so stupid I mean just baseline level room temperature IQ stupid Wow Wow don't tell me Caitlyn Jenner is like my wife he's not like my wife okay this is silly talk and it turns out when the baby comes out there are only two boxes on that chart male or female pick one and stick with it gang yeah anyway we'll be back with more of the destruction of the world tomorrow but you know finding smiles in times of sadness that's what we do here and then Clavin makes you feel better about everything anyway he'll tell you that everything will be okay he's wrong but go over and
