00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,170
There are some shark species that seem to
do okay in aquariums. You’ll see a lot of

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,519
nurse sharks, zebra sharks, some reef sharks
and sand tiger sharks. But not the great white.

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,129
For decades, aquariums have tried to contain
the world’s largest predatory fish.

4
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:19,220
Institutions like Marineland, SeaWorld and
the Steinhart Aquarium repeatedly took in

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,340
white sharks during the 1970s, 80s and 90s, at times
drawing huge crowds.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,800
But they never lasted long. Some needed help swimming. None of them would eat.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,700
The longest one lasted was just 16 days.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,900
A 1984 report by the Steinhart Aquarium put it this way:

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,810
"In most cases it could be said that all these
captive sharks were merely in the process

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,400
of dying, with some taking longer than others."
They had constructed an elaborate transport

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,540
tank with a harness and IV fluids, but still
couldn’t keep the sharks alive.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,040
It wasn’t until 2004 that the Monterey Bay
Aquarium proved that it was possible to keep

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,120
white sharks for at least six months. It took
a massive effort, and no one’s done it since.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,960
JON HOECH: Our approach was one of sort of
a systematic, logical sequence of things leading

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,759
up to our success and it started with designing
a tank.

16
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,189
The Monterey Bay Aquarium had a million gallon,
egg-shaped tank, 35 feet deep, designed for

17
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:28,200
open-ocean animals like tuna and sharks. So
you need a big tank. You also need a small shark.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,460
Adult great whites reach 15 feet on average.

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,520
The Monterey Bay Aquarium nabbed one in 2004
that was 4 feet, 4 inches, less than a year old.

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,560
That made it easier to move and easier
to keep.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,100
JON HOECH: When they’re young they feed
on fish. And as they get older they transition

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,160
to feeding more on mammals. And so we were targeting
the age bracket where we knew we were more

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,220
able to feed their natural diet.
And once they collected the shark, they didn’t

24
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,120
take it straight to the aquarium. Instead,
the Monterey Bay team set up a 4 million gallon

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,799
pen right there in the ocean.
That way they could monitor the shark and

26
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,908
see if it would feed before they moved it
into a transport tank to travel from southern California

27
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:16,360
where the sharks were born up to the aquarium.
Sharks, like all fish, need to have water

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,140
continually passing through their gills in
order to get oxygen.

29
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,019
Most species can open and close their mouths
to pump the water through. But white sharks

30
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,959
and a couple dozen other species don’t do
that. To breathe, they have to move forward

31
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,189
through the water with their mouths open.
That’s why white sharks start to weaken

32
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:38,379
as soon as they’re caught in a net. And
that’s why they needed a custom built transport

33
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:42,579
tank with mobile life support.
JON HOECH: Everything from oxygen sensors

34
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:49,299
and video cameras and lighting and filtration
systems that were needed for what turned out

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,240
to roughly be 9 to 11 hour transport time.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,980
Aquarium attendance jumped 30 percent while the shark was on display.

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,800
After 6 and a half months, they decided to

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,060
release it because it had killed 2 other
sharks.

39
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,060
Over the next 6 years, the aquarium displayed
5 more baby white sharks - some they paid

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,000
fishermen to hand over, some they caught themselves.
Their stays ranged from just 11 days up to

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,549
5 months. The Monterey Bay Aquarium had succeeded
in doing what no one else could.

42
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,329
But it did take a toll on the sharks. They
developed visible sores from bumping into

43
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,769
the sides of the tank.
SEAN VAN SOMMERAN: We actually snuck in with

44
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:33,220
photographers and took pictures of the sharks
as they were beginning to attrit and fail

45
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,420
due to the constant scraping against the walls
basically. As we viewed it, it was a vase

46
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,959
of flowers that would be kept for the visitors.
Historically, aquariums kept sharks that lived

47
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,359
near the seabed or near reefs. That makes
sense - it’s easier to recreate those

48
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,560
habitats in a tank. But in recent decades,
aquariums have wanted to bring in bigger,

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,620
more pelagic sharks, those that spend time
roaming the open ocean.

50
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,560
They’ve even been able to exhibit the largest
shark in the world, the whale shark,

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,560
if they have a big enough tank.
But pelagic sharks are used to being able

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,249
to swim long distances without obstructions,
changing directions only as they please.

53
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:15,560
So the faster-moving sharks like the
white shark, mako shark, and blue shark,

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,560
they have trouble with walls when they’re
put in a tank.

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,800
That’s what was happening with the Monterey
Bay Aquarium’s sixth white shark in 2011.

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,390
They decided to release it after 55 days and
its tracking tag revealed that the shark died

57
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,820
shortly after being released. They’re not
 sure why.

58
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,520
But since then, they haven’t tried bring in
another great white shark.

59
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,140
JON HOECH: It’s just a very very very resource
intensive program and we felt like we had

60
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,950
accomplished our goal of introducing the general
public to a live white shark.

61
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,030
It took a huge, carefully planned system to
keep a white shark alive. And even then,

62
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,040
the sharks didn’t quite fit there.
We can’t seem to stop trying though.

63
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,780
Earlier this year, an 11.5-foot great white shark
was taken to an aquarium in Okinawa, Japan

64
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,500
after getting caught in a fisherman's net.
It was the only adult white shark ever to

65
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,610
be put on display, and within 3 days

66
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,900
it was dead.

67
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,540
I wanted show you a great resource online
called the Biodiversity Heritage

68
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,340
Library - it’s the product of a couple dozen
museums and libraries all agreeing to scan millions of

69
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,190
pages from books related to biodiversity.
They’ve got a bunch of great albums on Flickr,

70
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,370
including one that's all about sharks.
Some of these go back to the 16th and 17th centuries,

71
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,600
back when the naturalists used to call sharks “sea dogs”

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,210
which is funny because as we now know

73
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,360
sharks were roaming the oceans for about 300 million years

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:00:00,000
before the first mammals showed up.
