1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,909
do you ever use really strange metaphors

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,520
and similes that you don't really

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,830
understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use them first thing</font>

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">you all you they just feel very</font>

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,620
instinctive don't know whether this just

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,349
tells you more about me than it does

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,389
actually about you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the</font>

8
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,670
world probably the former but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,289
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone this morning they</font>

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,880
were asking me how I<font color="#CCCCCC"> felt and I was like</font>

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I feel a bit like a moose on a wall</font>

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,920
this coming from someone who's never

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,960
seen a moose on a wall or otherwise

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,000
except in films and things I was like

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really fight the head of</font>

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,630
moose and all I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a whole body</font>

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,559
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moose on a wall a stuffed moose</font>

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,469
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again not the person who hunted</font>

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,300
me killed me not their pride and<font color="#E5E5E5"> joy</font>

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,600
like not the big hunters like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,539
moose I feel like the moose that was

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,820
stuffed and relegated to the back of

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">right the antique shop or the charity</font>

24
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,809
shop some of you guys might call the

25
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,000
thrift store something<font color="#E5E5E5"> really random and</font>

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,070
slightly disgusting that someone would

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,500
pick up in need of something Retro<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,938
like weird and so a hipster<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am a full</font>

29
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:09,900
stuffed big hipster moose on a walk the

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,820
Moose itself as an oyster the

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">acquisition of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Moose is hipster I do</font>

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,600
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that just me or do you find</font>

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself describe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself in really</font>

34
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,580
really bizarre attempt in other news my

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,619
friend Natalie here was trying to get

36
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">into like a not particularly ripe banana</font>

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,689
and she said this is so hard it's like

38
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,280
hacking into the Pentagon and I

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,509
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really probably say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

40
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">eat you but I thought was quite funny</font>

41
00:01:32,340 --> 00:00:00,000
over and out
