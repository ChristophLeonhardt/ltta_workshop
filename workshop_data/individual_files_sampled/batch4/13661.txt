who do you think should be chosen for a Supreme Court for the Supreme Court Amy Kony Barrett Metsu I think she's terrific I think there are a lot of good options out there and it looks like the shortlist is down to three some the other people seem okay she seems to be the most rock-ribbed she seems to be the most sure thing on a personal level and you know optics do matter that the personality does matter because you know we they will be going through a confirmation process this will play out on a political stage she's just it appears unimpeachable and terrific she raised seven children while becoming a federal judge she's takes her religion seriously Dianne Feinstein said that the what is it the dogma lives loudly within her works for me and and she's been through this vetting process very recently the same process so I think it'd be good and I think it would be it'd be nice to have someone that we can rely upon to be an originalist on the court and she seems pretty rock-ribbed this isn't to say that the others are awful but she's got my support
