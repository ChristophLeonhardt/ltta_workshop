1
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:09,555
>>  WELCOME BACK.

2
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:12,024
THE HOUSE COULD TAKE UP A

3
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,159
COMPROMISED IMMIGRATION BILL

4
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:16,195
THIS COMING WEEK, AND THE

5
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:18,297
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TIGHTENING

6
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:21,434
THE THUMB SCREWS ON DEMOCRATS AS

7
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:24,103
MORE KIDS ARE SEPARATED FROM

8
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:25,504
THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER.

9
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:26,939
THE TWEET TODAY, DEMOCRATS CAN

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,875
FIX THE FORCED FAMILY BREAKUP AT

11
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,276
THE BORDER BY WORKING ON NEW

12
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:31,611
LEGISLATION FOR A CHANGE.

13
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:32,411
THIS IS WHY WE NEED MORE

14
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:34,881
REPUBLICANS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER.

15
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,282
DEMOCRATS ARE ONLY GOOD AT THREE

16
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:37,984
THINGS, HIGH, AT THATS, HIGH

17
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:40,653
CRIME AND OBSTRUCTION.

18
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:41,220
SAD.

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,358
NOT SAD, BUT A HAPPY LARRY

20
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:46,525
O'CONNOR TO DISCUSS.

21
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:48,527
THE PRESIDENT IS OF MANY THINGS,

22
00:00:48,527 --> 00:00:51,230
A MASTER AT FRAMING A DEBATE.

23
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,432
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIM FRAMING

24
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,501
THIS DEBATE ABOUT THESE KIDS

25
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,937
BEING LOCKED UP AS THE FAULT OF

26
00:00:57,937 --> 00:00:58,337
DEMOCRATS?

27
00:00:58,337 --> 00:00:58,838
IS HE WINNING?

28
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:00,573
>> WELL, I THINK SO FAR HE IS.

29
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:01,908
I THINK HE IS ACTUALLY WINNING

30
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:02,875
THAT DEBATE BECAUSE I GUESS

31
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,176
THEY'VE GOT A COUPLE OF

32
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:06,312
DIFFERENT ANGLES THEY CAN TAKE

33
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:10,516
ON THE TRUMPED UP CONTROVERSY

34
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:11,183
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

35
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:11,984
CELEBRATION OF THE KIDS.

36
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,520
WHERE WAS THE OUTCRY WHEN THIS

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,688
EXACT POLICY WAS INSTITUTED

38
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:16,255
UNDER BARACK OBAMA?

39
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,124
AND THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS

40
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:18,491
ITSELF.

41
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:19,358
THE SECOND IS THIS, THE

42
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:20,293
PRESIDENT IS ON THE RECORD

43
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:22,261
SAYING, HEY, I'M WILLING TO MEET

44
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,562
YOU GUYS SOMEWHERE, I RAN ON THE

45
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:29,235
IDEA THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO  GIVE

46
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:29,735
AMNESTY WITHOUT--

47
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:34,073
AND YOU'VE GO  GOT TO GIVE

48
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:34,440
SOMETHING.

49
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,441
>> THE FACT REMAINS THE

50
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:36,475
PRESIDENT IS A LITTLE ON

51
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:37,677
DEFENSE, IF HE WANT TODAY CHANGE

52
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:39,211
THE POLICY, HE COULD.

53
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,980
THAT'S A PREROGATIVE OF THE

54
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,348
EXECUTIVE AND THIS IS HOW HE IS

55
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:43,516
DEFENDING IT, AND THIS IS HOW

56
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:45,351
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO MAKE

57
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:46,218
HAY OUT OF IT.

58
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:46,986
TAKE A LISTEN.

59
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:48,220
>> NO, I HATE IT.

60
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,090
I HATE THE CHILDREN BEING TAKEN

61
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,791
AWAY.

62
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,826
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO CHANGE

63
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:54,226
THEIR LAW.

64
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:56,762
THAT'S THE DEMOCRATS' LAW.

65
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,965
WE CAN CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW.

66
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:01,667
>> DO YOU THINK CHILDREN,

67
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,402
WHETHER DREAMERS OR LITTLE

68
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:05,938
CHILDREN AT THE BORDER NOW FOR

69
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:07,740
POLITICAL PURPOSE, IT'S

70
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,107
SHAMEFUL.

71
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,675
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO YOU'RE

72
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,277
GOING TO AGREE WITH.

73
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:12,845
>> WHO HEAR THAT NANCY PELOSI

74
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:15,147
SAY IT'S SHAMEFUL TO USE

75
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:17,883
CHILDREN TO PUSH A POLICY, IS

76
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:18,317
RIDICULOUS.

77
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:20,920
AND DEMOCRATS SAY IT'S ALL ABOUT

78
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,754
THE CHILDREN AND CHILDREN ARE

79
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:22,154
SUFFERING.

80
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,757
ON ANY POLICY, THE IDEA OF

81
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:27,660
DEMOCRATS JUMPING UP AND MEDIA

82
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,628
JUMPING UP, MOST OF THE MEDIA

83
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:30,863
AND THUMPING THE BIBLE.

84
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:32,598
LELAND: HE STARTED THAT.

85
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:34,700
BUT HE STARTED AS WELL YOU WANT

86
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,235
TO USE CHRISTIAN VALUES, THERE

87
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:37,536
ARE OTHER CHRISTIAN VALUES.

88
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,172
THESE GUYS HAVE NOT USED THE

89
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:42,441
BIBLE TO JUSTIFY A LOT OF

90
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:43,542
POLICIES THAT GO AGAINST MY

91
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,877
CHRISTIAN VALUES AND THEY'LL

92
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:46,879
CALL ME THE PERSON WHO IS TRYING

93
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,581
TO PUSH THEOCRACY BECAUSE I WANT

94
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:50,282
TO PROTECT UNBORN CHILDREN.

95
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:52,985
LET'S SEE THEM PUSH THAT ASIDE.

96
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:56,088
WHY AREN'T THEY UPSET ABOUT THE

97
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:58,391
CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM PARENTS

98
00:02:58,391 --> 00:02:59,625
BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE CRIMES

99
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,526
COMMITTED IN THIS COUNTRY.

100
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:03,062
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CHILDREN

101
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:04,797
SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THE ILLEGAL

102
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:05,431
IMMIGRATION AND CRIMES

103
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:06,966
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

104
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:11,737
LELAND: THERE'S RHETORIC ON BOTH

105
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:12,238
SIDES.

106
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:13,706
AND IN THE END YOU SEE BOTH

107
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:15,708
SIDES JOCKEYING FOR POSITION ON

108
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,042
THIS.

109
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:16,909
THERE IS TWO BILLS IN CONGRESS

110
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,111
RIGHT NOW, THE GOOD LIVES BILL

111
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,212
AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY AGREES

112
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:21,647
IS PRETTY MUCH DEAD ON ARRIVAL

113
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:24,350
AND THE NEW, QUOTE, UNQUOTE,

114
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,684
COMPROMISE BILL THAT EVEN SOME

115
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:26,719
REPUBLICANS ARE NOW SAYING

116
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,521
THEY'RE NOT OKAY WITH.

117
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,322
SO, WHAT'S THE POINT?

118
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:31,857
IS THIS GOING TO GET SOLVED?

119
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:32,425
>> I DON'T KNOW.

120
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,159
I DON'T THINK THAT DEMOCRATS

121
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,993
WANT THIS SOLVED.

122
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:34,627
I THINK IT'S REALLY--

123
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:37,063
OTHER THAN WE'RE GOING TO

124
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:39,598
IMPEACH TRUMP, I DON'T WHAT

125
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,200
OTHER ISSUE THEY'VE GOT GOING

126
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,801
INTO NOVEMBER.

127
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:44,303
I FRANKLY DON'T THINK THEY WANT

128
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:47,373
TO FIXED.

129
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:52,311
AND I DON'T THINK THAT GOODLATTE

130
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:54,280
IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL.

131
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,314
THAT IS THE GOOD COMPROMISE BILL

132
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:57,550
GIVING AMNESTY TO 700,000

133
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,384
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

134
00:03:58,384 --> 00:03:59,285
THE PRESIDENT NEVER PLANNED ON

135
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:00,386
RUNNING ON THAT.

136
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,021
IT'S BASICALLY SAYING SOME

137
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:02,788
PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT

138
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:04,323
MOST AMERICANS AGREE WITH, WHICH

139
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:07,460
IS LET'S HAVE MANDATED E-VERIFY.

140
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,228
MAKE EVERY EMPLOYER DO AN

141
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:10,429
E-VERIFY ON THE IMMIGRATION

142
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:10,796
STATUS.

143
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:12,031
WHAT THEY'RE CALLING THE

144
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:13,532
COMPROMISE BILL, LELAND, DOESN'T

145
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:15,634
MANDATE THAT SO WE'RE NEVER

146
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:17,269
GOING TO FIX THE ILLEGAL

147
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,238
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM IF WE DON'T

148
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:20,473
WANT THAT.

149
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:21,673
LELAND: YOU DON'T THINK THAT THE

150
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:23,042
DEMOCRATS WANT TO FIX THIS

151
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:23,876
BECAUSE IT'S--

152
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:25,911
>> I'M CYNICAL.

153
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:28,280

CYNICAL WITH ME, ARE THERE SOME

166
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:34,086
REPUBLICANS THINK THIS IS BETTER

167
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:36,288
AS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE THAN TO

168
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:36,689
COMPROMISE?

169
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,290
>> I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK

170
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,426
SOME REPUBLICANS WANT IT AS A

171
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:43,562
CAMPAIGN ISSUE SADLY OPENING UP

172
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:45,364
MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ILLEGAL

173
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:49,768
IMMIGRATION BECAUSE A LOT OF

174
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:51,704
THEY RAISE A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF

175
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:54,140
IT OR REALLY THINK IT'S BETTER

176
00:04:54,140 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR OUR ECONOMY TO HAVE A FLEE
