3
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,030
THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,866
TWEETED, THIS IS MY 500TH DAY IN

5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,868
OFFICE AND WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED A

6
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:18,568
LOT.

7
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:21,972
MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENT.

8
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:22,472
VERY COMPETITIVE.

9
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:25,575
IN FACT, MOST REPUBLICANS DO

10
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:27,778
AGREE, BASED ON GALLUP NUMBERS,

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,012
TRUMP HAS THE SECOND-HIGHEST

12
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:30,781
RATINGS EVER BY A PRESIDENT'S

13
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,450
OWN PARTY AFTER THE 500 DAY MARK

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,251
AT 87%.

15
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,118
THAT SECOND ONLY TO

16
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,086
GEORGE W. BUSH AND THAT, OF

17
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:39,222
COURSE, WAS NINE AFTER 9/11.

18
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:41,258
DOES THIS SPELL TROUBLE FOR

19
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:43,226
DEMOCRATS AFTER THEY LOST THEIR

20
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:45,262
BIG LEAD IN THE MIDTERM GENERIC

00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:47,063
ELECTION GOAL TELL MY POLLS?

22
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:49,766
LET'S DIVE IN WITH MATCH LAP,

23
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,434
CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSERVATIVE

24
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,102

26
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:58,475
OUR REPORT CARDS AS WELL.

27
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,813
500 DAYS IN, MATT, I THOUGHT

28
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:03,346
TRUMP WOULD DO WELL.

29
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:04,815
I DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD DO THIS

30
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,114
WELL.

31
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,016
I DID NOT PREDICT.

32
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,552
I PREDICTED HE WOULD WIN THE

33
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:17,027
PRESIDENCY.

34
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:19,429
HISTORIC LOWS, THE LIST GOES ON.

35
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:22,766
JERUSALEM, ALL OF THE STUFF -- I

36
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,701
AM SPEECHLESS ABOUT THAT.

37
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:29,172
>> I AM AMAZED THAT THE FLOODING

38
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,741
OF DECISIONS, PROMISE MADE,

39
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,777
PROMISE KEPT ON ISSUE AFTER

00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:35,479
ISSUE, PRESIDENTS LIKE THE SPACE

41
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,948
IT OUT, TAKE A BREATH.

42
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,816
THIS PRESIDENT -- I HAD TO WRITE

43
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:40,217
IT ALL DOWN.

44
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:41,818
COULDN'T KEEP TRACK OF IT.

45
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:42,519
THERE'S SO MUCH GETTING DONE.

46
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,587
I AGREE WITH YOU.

47
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,788

50
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:48,859
SEPARATE ROSTERS FOR THEM?

51
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,460
I THINK WE DO.

56
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,804

I LOVE IT.

00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:10,312
WHY YOU IN RED?

00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:13,350
THAT USUALLY FOR A F.

64
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,620
>> THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS

65
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,888
MIGHT NOT WANT TO DEFUND IT OR

66
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,689
TAKE THE STEPS TO DO IT, BUT THE

67
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,024
PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO DO IT.

68
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:22,592

BIGGEST IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY

72
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:28,798
AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE GROWING.

73
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:30,066
>> Laura: THE TAX BILL IN

74
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:30,400
THERE.

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,836
>> GOOD, VERY GOOD.

76
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,838
BIGGER BUT I DO NOT THINK THE

77
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,573
OBAMA REGULATIONS HAD A BIGGER

78
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:41,011
DAMPENING ON THE ECONOMY.

79
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:43,013
>> I'M THE 54% OF AMERICA NOT

00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,080

FOR YOU GUYS ARE AT 46% THAT IS

82
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:46,416

I'M THE 54% THAT IS NOT HAPPY.

84
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,786
>> Laura: TELL US WHY.

85
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,989
WHY YOU GAVE THEM A F.

86
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,591
>> YOU ARE GIVING ME A HARD TIME

87
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,259
DURING THE BREAK AND I SAID, I'M

88
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,395
SORRY, THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

89
00:02:58,395 --> 00:02:59,529
LISTEN, THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

90
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:00,463

00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,971
GAS, THEY CANNOT NOW.

94
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:08,672
ALSO, THE SOCIAL SECURITY,

95
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,472
MEDICARE HAS BEEN PUT IN REST BY

96
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,207
THE PRESIDENT.

97
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,609
HE HAS BEEN A COMPLETE AND TOTAL

98
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,579
WASHOUT AS A FAILURE AS OF THE

99
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:16,980
METS GET POLICY PRESIDENT.

100
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,647
I'M SURPRISED ESTABLISHMENT

101
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:18,848
REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T STOOD UP

102
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,016
MORE TO THIS PRESIDENT TO FIGHT

103
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:20,717
FOR SOME OF THE VALUES THEY

104
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,319
CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT.

105
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,254
>> Laura: HERE IS AN

106
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:26,790
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN, RYAN

107
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,457
COSTELLO FROM PENNSYLVANIA.

108
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,861
TRUMP WON PENNSYLVANIA FIRST

109
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:39,803
TIME SINCE GW WON IN '88.

110
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,971
>> INSTANCES WHERE YOU SEE

111
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,006
REPUBLICAN PUSHBACK IN THE HOUSE

112
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,307
AND SENATE, I FOUND MYSELF VERY,

113
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,543
VERY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WE HAVE

114
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:48,612
THE RIGHT, WE HAVE THE LEFT, BUT

115
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:49,813
WE DO HAVE A CENTER.

116
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,181
I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS IN THE

117
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,415
CENTER DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO

118
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:52,782
BELIEVE.

119
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,785
YOU GET YOUR HEAD CHOPPED OFF IF

120
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,621
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRYING

121
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:58,288
TO USE COMMON SENSE.

122
00:03:58,288 --> 00:03:59,689
>> Laura: HE PICKED UP HIS

123
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:00,290
MARBLES AND WENT HOME.

124
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,225
HE'S RETIRING.

125
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,294
>> A LITTLE YOUNG TO BE

126
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:04,661
RETIRING.

127
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,829
>> A LOT OF THESE REPUBLICANS IN

128
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,797
THE HOUSE WHO AREN'T RUNNING FOR

129
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,866
REELECTION, THEY THOUGHT TRUMP

130
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,468
WAS SO ATROCIOUS THAT THEY RAN

131
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:11,868
OUT OF TOWN.

132
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,670
>> Laura: THAT IS FUNNY!

133
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,005
WE HAVE TO GO TO FOREIGN POLICY.

134
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,273
JOEL, YOU ARE A LITTLE MORE

135
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,075
GENUINE.

136
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:23,346
MORE GENEROUS.

137
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,181
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM MORE THAN

138
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:25,982
THAT.

139
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:26,916
>> WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER SEGMENT

140
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,717
FOR THAT.

141
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:29,753
>> Laura: LET'S LEAVE THAT

142
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:30,186
BEHIND.

143
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,422
YOU GAVE THEM A D+ PURE WHITE?

144
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,423
>> I PUT THE PLOTS.

145
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:36,926
I PUT A MINUS, I THINK THE GRADE

146
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:37,360
IS INCOMPLETE.

147
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,597
WE GOT TO SEE WITH NORTH KOREA.

148
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:41,865
I'M NOT A FAN OF THIS PRESIDENT.

149
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,766
I'LL GIVE IN THE FIRST PERSON TO

150
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,067
GIVE THEM CREDIT IF HE CAN

151
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:48,371
ACTUALLY BRING PEACE.

152
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,072
IF HE STABILIZES THE KOREAN

153
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,306
PENINSULA, AND WILL GIVE THEM

154
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:50,640
CREDIT.

155
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,575
HE'S EMBARRASSED US ON THE WORLD

156
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:52,876
STAGE.

157
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:53,977
DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST --

158
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:55,545
>> Laura: HOW DID HE

159
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,112
DESTABILIZE US IN THE

160
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:56,513
MIDDLE EAST?

161
00:04:56,513 --> 00:05:00,183
>> OF LET ME FINISH, I WILL

162
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:00,517
EXPLAIN.

163
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,986
DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST --

164
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:04,521
BE WHEN HE KILLED ICE IS OFF

165
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,222
ICES IS GONE.

166
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,490
ALSO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE

167
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,491
DEATH OF A LOT OF INNOCENT WOMEN

168
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,994
AND CHILDREN A COUPLE OF YEARS

169
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:11,261
AGO.

170
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,462
>> Laura: OBAMA NEVER --

171
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:13,763
DRONES -- THE LEFT TRASH OBAMA

172
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:15,165
FOR DRONES.

173
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,700
FOREIGN POLICY?

174
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,667
VEHICLE B+.

175
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:23,273
I WOULD SAY -- I DIDN'T GIVE HIM

176
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:24,007
AN A BECAUSE HE'S UPSETTING THE

177
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:27,243
APPLE CART.

178
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,611
I'M HAPPY ABOUT NAFTA, I LOVE

179
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:29,012
NORTH KOREA.

180
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,580
BUT WE'VE GOT TO SEE THE NEXT

181
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,014
STEP IS.

182
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:33,216
I THINK HE HAS A STEP TO BE

183
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:34,284
TRANSFORMATIONAL ON FOREIGN

184
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:34,617
POLICY.

185
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:38,121
IT'S ABOUT EXECUTION WITH FULTON

186
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:41,591
AND POMPEO.

187
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,961
>> I WILL MOVE THEM UP TO AC FOR

188
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:45,361
NORTH KOREA.

189
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,664

190
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:48,665
THOUGHTS ON SOMETHING THAT

191
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:49,966
DEVELOPS AMID REPORTS THAT MANY

192
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,634
PLAYERS REFUSING TO SHOW UP TO

193
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,802
THE WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW,

194
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:55,772
PRESIDENT TRUMP DISINVITED THE

195
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,473
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES AHEAD OF

00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:57,173
THEIR VISIT TO CELEBRATE THE

197
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,008
TEAM SUPER BOWL WIN.

198
00:05:59,008 --> 00:05:59,876
THE PRESIDENT AND THE STATEMENTS

199
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,511
GO TO THE TEAM OVER THE REFUSAL

200
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,514
TO PROUDLY STAND FOR THE

201
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,816
NATIONAL ANTHEM HANDOVER HEART.

202
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,385
>> IS IT SMART TO JUST INVITE

203
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:09,986
PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING?

204
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,187
I FEEL BAD FOR THE FANS MADE THE

205
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:11,755
TRIP TO BE HERE.

206
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,691
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY IN

207
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,393
AMERICA WHO FEEL SORRY FOR NFL

208
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:17,727
PLAYERS.

209
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:18,361
>> Laura: THE NBA IS MUCH

210
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:20,330
BETTER ABOUT THIS.

211
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,400
>> I WAS AT THE CAVS GAME --

212
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,702

213
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:27,370
MANAGE TO DO THIS RIGHT?

214
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,606
>> EVEN THOUGH ALL THE EAGLES

215
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,574
WITH THE ENTIRE YEAR, NO ONE

216
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:33,977
ELSE, NO ONE SAT DOWN TO CHECK

217
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,577
"THE WASHINGTON TIMES."

218
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:39,783
NONE OF THEM KNELT.

219
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:40,650
NONE OF THEM WANT TO BE THERE

220
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,651
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE

221
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,187
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

222
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,989
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA -- BY THE

223
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,290
WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA, MANY

224
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,992
PEOPLE DID NOT COME TO THE

225
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:49,759
WHITE HOUSE OVER THE EIGHT YEARS

226
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,360
OF PRESIDENT OBAMA DID.

227
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,195
DID HE EVER JUST INVITE ONE?

228
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:52,762
NOT ONE.

229
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:53,663
THIS GUY IS A SNOWFLAKE.

230
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,565
HE CAN HANDLE CRITICISM.

231
00:06:55,565 --> 00:07:00,136
HE CAN HANDLE A TOUGH CROWD.

232
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:03,807
IF HE CAN'T HANDLE CARSON ONCE,

233
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:04,374
HOPEFULLY HE --

234
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,008
>> Laura: I WOULDN'T HAVE

235
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,977
DISINVITED THEM.

236
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:11,981
FIRST OF ALL, JOEL, HE BEAT THE

237
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,784

VEHICLE YES, HE BEAT THEM BY

239
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:17,153
MINUS 3 MILLION VOTES.

240
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:19,989
DID A GREAT JOB.

241
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,524
>> Laura: OKAY, MR. GET RID OF

242
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,125
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

243
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,594
YOU CAN DO THAT NEXT SHOW.

244
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,763
HE BEAT HOLLYWOOD, THE G.O.P.

245
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:27,797
ESTABLISHMENT, HEAR CLEAR CUT

246
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:28,798
THE WHOLE FIELD --

247
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:30,733
>> A RACE TO 43%.

248
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,602
>> Laura: HE'S AFRAID OF

249
00:07:32,602 --> 00:00:00,000
COMPETITION?
