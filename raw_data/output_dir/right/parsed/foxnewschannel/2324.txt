REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY.
ALL OF US WITH AN IMPORTANT
ALLIE.
WE WISH YOU THE BEST.
>> NEWLY CONFIRMED PROMISES HAVE
BEEN MADE AND DASHED.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THIS TODAY.
>> President Trump: NO, I DON'T
THINK HE'S PLAYING.
NO I DON'T THINK HE'S PLAYING.
IT IS NEVER GONE LIKE THIS.
IT HAS NEVER GONE THIS FAR.
I DON'T THINK IT HAS THIS
ENTHUSIASM FOR THEM WANTING TO
MAKE A DEAL.
>> THE CHEN THE HOOVER INSTITUTE
FELLOW AND ADVISOR FOR MITT
ROMNEY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
AND THE FORMER PRESS SECRETARY
FOR NICKY HILLY.
GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.
>> THANK YOU, SHANNON.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
>> CHRISTOPHER HILL A LEAD
NEGOTIATOR WITH NORTH KOREA
UNDER THE GEORGE W BUSH SAYS.
>> IT IS A START WHAT WE'RE
HEARING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH
KOREA.
I'M GUIDED BY MY EXPERIENCE.
THEY SAY ALL THE RIGHT THINGS
BUT GAVE US A DECLARATION NOT
COMPLETE AND ENTIRELY ACCURATE
AND FAILED TO GIVE US ANY
VERIFICATION PROTOCOL.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TOUGH NEXT
STEPS THAT COME FROM, YOU KNOW
THIS HAPPY GLOW OVER WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH
KOREA, BUT GETTING TO BRASS TAX.
>> I THINK THERE'S GREAT REASON
TO BE OPTIMISTIC, BUT I THINK
THE WARNINGS CLEARLY MATTER A
LOT THERE.
ARE SOME VERY STICKY ISSUES.
THE QUESTION OF U.S. PRESENCE IS
SOMETHING THAT FOR, EXAMPLE, THE
NORTH KOREA CONSIDER TO BE A
NONSTARTER GOING FORWARD.
FOR THE UNITED STATES THERE IS
BY QUESTIONS AROUND
NUCLEARIZATION.
IS KIM JUNE UNIT SERIOUS ABOUT
ENDING HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAMMING?
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS HE WILL
SIT DOWN SHOULD HE SIT DOWN WITH
KIM JONG-UN.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT DESERVES
CREDIT.
BUT IT IS STILL A MAMMOTH TASK.
>> THERE WERE SKEPTICS WHETHER
WE WOULD GET TO THIS MOMENT.
>> BEN ROSE OF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION TWEETED IN
SEPTEMBER EVERY TAUNT BACK AND
FORTH BETWEEN TRUMP AND KIM
JONG-UN MEANS DIPLOMACY LESS
POSSIBLE.
>> SAYING WE ARE FAR CLOSER TO
ACTUALLY CONFLICT OVER NORTH
KOREA THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
REALIZE GEORGE SOR, OS SAYING
THE UNITED STATES IS SET ON THE
COURSE TOWARDS NUCLEAR WAR.
DO YOU THINK ANY THOUGHT WE
WOULD GET TO THIS POINT WHERE
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE HAS TO
CLOSE THE DEAL AND A LOT TO DO,
DO YOU THINK THEY EVER THOUGHT
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR WOULD
HAPPEN ON HIS WATCH?
>> THOSE PICTURES WE ALL WATCHED
YESTERDAY, AND THIS MORNING, AS
THEY HAVE BEEN REPLAYED HAVE
BEEN REMARKABLE.
WE REALLY ARE SURPRISED BY WHAT
HAS TRANSPIRED CERTAINLY BETWEEN
THE TWO-GOAL KOREAS.
BUT AS YOU SAY THERE'S A LONG
WAYS TO GO TO WORK THINGS OUT.
ALL SORTS SORTS
OFICALLYIFICATIONS LIE AHEAD,
FROM HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY PUT
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN MOTION TO
BRING TO KOREAS WITH COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS.
ONE COMPLETELY AUTOCRATIC, THAT
HAS BEEN CRUEL TO ITS OWN
PEOPLE.
ANOTHER ONE, THAT IS A LIBERAL
DEMOCRACY IN COMPARISON WITH A
FREE ECONOMY?
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
ASPIRATIONS.
THAT WERE AT WAR, AND STILL ARE
THAT HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
ANOTHER THAT DONE.
ONE THAT IS STILL AT WAR WITH
THE UNITED STATES.
LOTS OF COMPLICATIONS ALL OF
THOSE LOVELY PICTURES THAT WE
SAW THAT LOOK SOUP LISTING BELIE
A VERY COMPLICATED ROAD AHEAD.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING INTO
NEGOTIATIONS, IF THEY ACTUALLY
DO HAPPEN IN A VERYICALLYCATED
SITUATION.
NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY
WANT TO RUSH INTO.
WANT TO RUSH INTO.
NOW WE FIND OURSELVES IN A
DIFFERENT SCENARIO.
>> IT IS NOT JUST THE KOREAS AND
THE U.S.
OTHER PARTIES AND OTHER NATION
ALSO HAVE SOME SAY WHETHERRER
OUT FRONT OR THROUGH BACK DOORS
LIKE CHINA.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> LONNY.
>> THE CHINESE, NO.
THE CHINESE ARE CRITICAL IN THIS
DISCUSSION.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT
THEY WERE ACTUALLY A PARTY TO
THE ORIGINAL END OF HOST STILT
OR THE TERMINATION OF HOSTILITY
AAGREEMENT IN THE 1950S.
THEY'RE PARTY AND THEY'RE
WATCHING WITH A VERY CAREFUL EYE
TOWARDS NORTH KOREA.
IN A LOT OF WAYS, CHINA CONTROLS
THE WILL LEVERS.
IT IS REALLY THE ELEPHANT IN THE
ROOM, WHEN IT COMES TO WHERE
NORTH KOREA GOES.
IN A LOT OF WAYS.
KIM JONG-UN WILL NOT DO ANYTHING
THAT RUNS ACROSS THE CHINESE.
FUNDAMENTALLY THE ROAD TO PEACE
IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND IN
TERMS OF BRINGING NORTH AND
SOUTH TOGETHER WILL STILL
LARGELY BE DICTATED BY THE
DISCUSSIONS THE U.S. HAS WITH
CHINA, WHICH IS COMPLICATED
FURTHER WE'RE PLAYING THE THREE
DIMENSIONAL GAME OF CHESS WITH
CHINA, GIVEN THE TRADE
SITUATION.
ALL OF THE FACTOURS HAVE TO BE
TAKEN TO INTO ACCOUNT.
>> IT IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
IT IS HOPEFUL TO SEE HIS IMAGES
BUT A VERY LONG ROAD TO GO
LEADING US FORWARD.
