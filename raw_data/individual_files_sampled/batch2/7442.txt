there's a special election taking place in Texas is seventh district and it turns out that establishment Democrats are aggressively pursuing a an apple research campaign against a Democrat who is running in the primary her name is Laura Moser she is a progressive and the d-triple-c absolutely despises her and nothing made that clearer than a recent attack that they lodged against her which read as follows now this is from Meredith Kelly d-triple-c communications director she says voters in Houston have organized for over a year to hold representative John Culberson accountable and and win this Clinton district let's stop for a second so in 2016 this particular district did vote for Hillary Clinton so that's what she's referring to there unfortunately she continues Laura Moser outright disgust for life in Texas disqualifies her as a general election candidate and Edward robbed voters of their opportunity to flip Texas is seventh in November so let's stop you they actually have even worse quote about her then we're gonna get to in a second but think about how unreal this is this is the Democratic Party attacking a Democrat in the in the primaries first of all what happened to pretending to be neutral during the primaries I guess that's gone that's totally out the door right you'll find out in a second their financial motivation to be opposed to Laura Moser and why they're not neutral secondly they did an oppo research memo on her why is it Democrat the opposition shouldn't you be spending your time during the opposition research on the Republicans does they're so soft in the general election but the Democratic Party is gathering opposition research on fellow Democrats because they're progressives right this just this proves everything we were worried about about the Democratic establishment they said it in public they state this publicly which leaves a point number three about that quote you can't take it back so if Laura Moser was the primary and you're goddamn right you will and you should we'll have the links down below to donate her to volunteered or go to our website i I couldn't oppose the d-triple-c more on this issue so but if she was the primary then the Republicans are gonna run ads saying her own party right said that she's disqualified because of her disgust for Texas you monsters you corrupt idiots we emphasize the idiots part right therefore so yeah so in their mind they think we want to take back this district we don't think this is the most viable candidate and we're gonna make it a very rare step of blasting our own or one of our own candidates right if you need to understand the credibility of their political analysis just look at their political tactic here were the net effect of them attacking her just like Debbie wasserman-schultz doing what you did to Bernie has the effect of rallying tons of support around her there will now be links in this video our group is going to send an email for her tomorrow many other groups were out there endorsing her today so if you want to think about the political strategic insights of the Democratic Party establishment this is representative of it it's just shooting ourselves in the foot after shooting ourselves in the foot and that's why it's so important that we not buy into something conventional wisdom that we're told to believe over and over again about how to fight various fights we need to support our own and get some real progressives elected so Anna makes a great point the only upside of this is that now you've almost guaranteed her victory in the primary thanks a lot you god you guys are so stupid who they thought in their bubble I will show her okay we already picked our hand-picked people one of whom is a former Goldman Sachs guy so we've got this figured out and all of our rich friends in Washington will be so aghast that Laura Moser and this will end her no what you've just told everybody is she's the actual progressive in the race and she doesn't represent the donors thank you thank you you morons and so and but one other thing is Adam said we and but they don't view it as yeah as per themselves as progressive that's what we keep making that mistake I make it too from time to time they view themselves as how my get rich I'm the guy and so that goes to the second terrible thing they said about Laura Moses was according to the intercept the more serious charged the party leveled at Moser was to imply corruption and self-dealing they wrote that in 2017 Moser paid over $50,000 in campaign money to her husband's DC consulting firm more than one of every six dollars spent by her campaign went straight into her husband's DC companies bank account okay so that's true but that money went into the firm's bank account and immediately went out of the bank account because that firm bought political ads for her which is what political consultants do now here's where the d-triple-c felt like there was a misstep first of all let me be clear the tree d-triple-c does self-dealing all the time okay and what I mean by that is they have their little list of consultants that they literally force Democratic candidates to work with and may make a ton of money off of taking campaign money from these candidates and patting their own pockets okay so this whole allegation of self dealing is laughable when it comes from the very people who do it themselves on a regular basis it's become so normalized now what what you know moser did in this case is not illegal it's not unusual again that money went toward political ads which is what that money was supposed to go towards let's just be clear about what firm this is this is actually Bernie's online consulting firm yes the one that helped him build a grassroots army so essentially what she was doing was investing in the grassroots as an alternative to big money politics that's right right in this moment as she gets attacked by establishment I want to Clichy will be more empowered to put up a big sale and let the wind blow her campaign forward because she has a huge grassroots army that she's been investing in which is what we want candidates to do right I actually talked to someone a couple years ago who is the online director for a major progressive Senate turn now and what this online director said was if I made one mistake in the campaign it wasn't going to bat early enough for a bigger investment in online because that is how you build your grassroots army and have them with you for a long haul so this is I mean maybe one-fifth is too little maybe she should do more if anything but good for her for investing in the best routes yeah and I want to be clear about that it's the the companies called revolution messaging and it's Birdy's company as in not that he owns it he also used them during the 2016 campaign and to great effect so again if anything you've just done an ad for revolution messaging so congratulations now the losers who wound up losing to Donald Trump didn't use revolution messaging they use the other companies that are connected to the d-triple-c in the people who work there and they are brazen about those connections look before we get into those connections let me just say I on this show a long time ago and that what do the corrupt do it's it's you see it all across the world's not just America in fact the crown prince in Saudi Arabia is doing it right now the most corrupt the first thing they do is they smear the opposition with charges of corruption so that but we go wait a minute you but you're the corrupt one they're like oh yeah now you're just trying to copy me and and and sometimes the smear does work if you're not knee-deep in politics oh you don't know in fact I talked to a a person who voted for Bernie Sanders today who said well I didn't know she said that about Texas oh so sometimes the smears do work I think in this in the long run here it's gonna backfire because of all the things that Adam is explained but if you never heard about it you might think oh my god Laura Mosers the one that's got issues no no it's the d-triple-c which in in in DC they're known informally as the consultant factory B KITT wonders the revolving door the people who used to work the d-triple-c then become consultants and then the d-triple-c gives them all the contracts I got to give you guys some specifics on that because that is the part that really infuriated me this is all about making money this is all big business to them and it's about crushing people who have a progressive grassroots agenda that they just cannot stand so to give you some examples of elected Democrats who have spoken out against this whole consultant scam representative Tim Ryan from Ohio said after the 2016 elections that the d-triple-c quote needs to go on a consultant detox okay but there's more I want to give you specifics so consultants take a percentage of all media placement of nads that enabled consulting firm mothership strategy which was founded by d-triple-c veterans to earn 3.9 million dollars from the failed special election campaign for john asif in georgia last year around 2.5 million of that AUSA paul came from media buys so they're just they're just making money and keep in mind the d-triple-c pressures the candidates to work with their consultants it's yeah I just got to make a real quick point about that I'm gonna let Anna continue so this is what if Bernie Sanders and real progressives like Laura Moser James Thompson in Kansas Brent welder in Kansas though Alison Hardison California the list goes on if those real progressives win they're fighting to get money out of politics well that would take money from these consultants that would be devastating to them on the other hand when John Asaf loses who cares they got rich what difference does it make if Joseph wins or loses they got the three point nine million dollars anyway so it's not they don't share your priorities their priority is how do I make a buck and then for them to turn around and smear a progressive like moser beyond the pale of course you got more I do have more so why do they hate Moser so much yes it has something to do with her progressive values but Moser actually called out the d-triple-c back in 2007 2017 in a an article that she wrote for Vogue and in that article she it was titled want more women to vote here's an idea stand up for them and it went on to slam the d-triple-c for saying the party would welcome anti-choice candidates now in that piece she wrote the following as a first time congressional candidate I've been warned not to criticize Ben ray Lujan and the powerful Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee but I cannot hold my tongue while Lujan and the d-triple-c abandon the commitment to human rights that brought me to the party in the first place d-triple-c didn't like that and so the opposition research began immediately and by the way just to clarify for anyone who's confused why some people are you know why she's being smeared as someone who hates Texas she had once said that she likes living in the city more than a small town and so she gave the example of Paris Texas as a place that she didn't enjoy living in and the d-triple-c took that out of context and used it to smear her as someone who hates Texas and and by the way she was referring to Paris Texas where her grandparents are from and which is hundreds of miles away from her district but they made it seem like she's saying it about her own voters in her district disingenuous live from the d-triple-c who would have guessed so I guess this is a declaration of war against all progressives and and it's ain't against the non-corrupt look so moser by the way is also just Democrat and in just Democrats the one thing you should know and you can look at their progressive platform etc but a lot of groups are progressive P triple C's wonderfully progressive democracy for America our revolution etc but all of them have pledged not to take corporate PAC money the Justice Democrats none of them take corporate PAC money so that is what makes those consultants and DC furious so in reality the executive director for example the new exec director for d-triple-c is Daniel Santa married to Elizabeth Christi Santa who after Daniel was selected as the executive director his wife wound up being a partner at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner and then the d-triple-c paid them three hundred ninety five thousand dollars over two years and in in the 2016 election and in this cycle have already funneled five hundred and twenty five thousand dollars to them so what a wonderful little circle they have gone but there's a lot more details we'll put the article from the intercept which is excellent in a description box as well written by three excellent reporters lee fong Ryan grim it's also a TYT contributor and david day and as good as it gets yeah he might have done us a favor by outing themselves in his situation because this is honestly just a tip of the iceberg they have made explicit what they do behind the scenes every single day we don't we talked to so many candidates who feel pressured by them who are encouraged to get out of the race by them even those who are ahead in fundraising because of grassroots donations are called gather waste because they're too progressive in some cases you know other reasons that are because they're too liberal about in various ways this is reckless this should be a rallying cry for all of us and a wake-up call and I know that my grandma in the past has told me oh I wrote a ten dollar check to the Democratic Party unlike grandma I like where you going in general but let me talk to you about other places to donate right but they people just assume good intentions here and they're uh not only undermining our agenda but again I believe undermining our ability to win I'm gonna say we in the broad sense those who want a big resistance victory in 2018 our ability to win because they're intentional unintentionally sabotaging us by putting lame people on the ballot and undermining people who actually win yeah and and one last thing it's a story that that we broke at TYT t1 t investigates reporter michael tracy broke it it's referenced in this intercept story there's a memo that they sent to all the candidates now one of them said hey don't attacked one another oops you just attacked a candidate in a primary violating your own memo in the most brazen outrageous way that I have ever seen so apparently you didn't mean it that you what you meant was progressives unilaterally surrender to the establishment candidates okay don't attack us exactly god there's the worst hypocrites but number two they told the candidates and that's what James Thompson from Kansas a wonderful progressive for almost one last time in Kansas this time he will win is objected to he said why do I have to spend all of this money with only the consultants that are on your list what if I found a great person working in the middle of Kansas what if I've got great progresses no you won't help me unless I spend most of my money with those consultants that you're in bed with he said no sorry no I'm not doing it okay and that's what all these progressive candidates should say and into Adams point so all of you out there if you're gonna give money that's great cuz small dollar donations are pulled together are more effective more powerful and will beat these corporate PACs but give it to progressive groups that you trust and because those groups have earned your trust don't just hand it over to people that call themselves Democrats all right check out all links below wonderful story by the intercept and by the way all the candidates we mentioned will put their links down below to go give them small dollar donations directly don't run us through this consultant factory what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can
