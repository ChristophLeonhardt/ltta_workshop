MARIA: WELCOME BACK REPUBLICANS ARE WORKING ON THEIR STRATEGY TO RETAIN CONTROL OF CONGRESS COME NOVEMBER AMID TALK OF A BLUE WAVE IN THE UPCOMING MID-TERMS. IN THE HOUSE WITH ME NOW IS HOW MAJORITY WHIP AND REPUBLICAN LOUISIANA CONGRESSMAN STEVE SCALISE. CONGRESSMAN IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. GOOD MORNING ALWAYS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU MARIA. MARIA: SO WHAT IS THE PLAN TO RETAIN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE FROM YOUR STANDPOINT? THE PLANS TO CONTINUE FOCUSING ON GETTING THE ECONOMY MOVING, SEEING THIS GREAT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THEN LOCKING IT IN WE'RE GOING TO BRING SOME MORE BILLS TO CUT TAXES, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE TAX CUTS PERMANENT THAT BILL CHAIRMAN BRADY AND HIS COMMITTEE ARE PROVIDE MORE REGULATORY RELIEF AND DO THINS TO HELP CREATE MORE WITH THE RADICAL LEFT'S AGENDA IN WASHINGTON. PELOSI IS TALKING ABOUT RAISING TAXES, SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ABOLISHING I.C.E., SINGLE-PAYER HEALTHCARE THAT'S NOT THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO SO LET'S KEEP THE ECONOMY MOVING WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE FOCUSING ON IT THIS WEEK AND BRING A BILL TO REPEAL THE MEDICAL DEVICE TAX PUSHBACK THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARIA: AND BY THE WAY THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO SHOW MOVEMENT THIS WEEK. WE GET THE GDP NUMBER OUT ON THURSDAY, AND ALL EXPECTATIONS PLAN. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE DEMOCRATS THOUGH ARE GOING TO DO IN RESPONSE TO THAT. JOE LINER MAN, FORMER SENATOR WROTE AN OP-ED AND LIEBERMAN WRITES THIS IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THIS WEEK, VOTE JOE CROWLEY FOR WORKING FAMILIES, IT BEGINS WITH THIS QUOTE. ALEXANDRIA CORTEZ'S SURPRISE PRIMARY VICTORY OVER REPRESENTATIVE JOE CROWLEY SEEMS LIKELY TO HURT CONGRESS, AMERICA , AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO. WHAT LIEBERMAN WRITES IS THAT HE'S HOPING THAT CROWLEY'S NAME IS ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE THE IDEA TO ABOLISH I.C.E. CAME FROM HER. ALEXANDRIA CORTEZ AND TOM PEREZ THE HEAD OF THE DNC SAYS SHE'S THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY. WELL I HOPE SHE IS, BECAUSE IT SHOWS SUCH A DRAMATIC SHIFT TO THE RADICAL LEFT. THAT'S NOT WHERE AMERICA IS. AMERICA IS STILL A CENTER RIGHT COUNTRY AND YOU SAW SHE WAS OUT THERE WITH BERNIE SANDERS GOING THROUGH THE MIDWEST, GOING TO MISSOURI. SHE WAS IN KANSAS CITY. THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH THIS IDEA OF ABOLISHING I.C.E. OF ALL THIN S. THINK ABOUT THIS MARIA. THE VERY PEOPLE WHO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE I.C.E. HAS BEEN DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR STOPPING HUMAN TRAFFICKING, SAVING SOME OF THESE KIDS BEING EXPLOITED FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THEM AND WANT OPEN BORDERS THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT. I HOPE THEY KEEP GOING AROUND LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THEY WERE IN THE MAJORITY. TERMS OF THAT BEING A PLATFORM TO RUN ON, IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION AND YOUR EFFORTS WE JUST HEARD FROM BOB GOODLATTE. ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT PROTECTS THE DACA RECIPIENTS BUT ALSO PROTECTS THIS COUNTRY WITH THE PROPER SECURITY IN TERMS OF SECURING THE BORDERS? WELL MARIA WE'VE HAD TWO DIFFERENT BILLS WE BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR THAT WOULD DO JUST THAT AND AS YOU HEARD CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE SAY WE'VE HAD LARGE NUMBERS OF REPUBLICANS VOTE FOR IT BUT NOT ONE DEMOCRAT SO WHEN YOU HAVE BETWEEN THE TWO BILLS, 224 REPUBLICANS VOTING YES TO BUILD A WALL, SECURE THE BORDER, SOLVE THE DACA PROBLEM, AND THE VISA LOTTERY SYSTEM AND NOT ONE SHOWS YOU THEY DON'T WANT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND WE DO, WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON IT BUT LET'S LOOK AT THOSE VOTES TO COUNTRY'S BORDER AND EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT VOTED NO BECAUSE NANCY PELOSI BULLIED THEM AND THREATENED THEM AND SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT TO PROVIDE DONALD TRUMP WITH A WIN. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS GET THE ECONOMY MOVING, TO BRING REGULATIONS UNDER CONTROL, IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING. TO THE THINGS THAT ARE HELPING REBUILD OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS A LOSING STRATEGY FOR DEMOCRATS. MARIA: AND IN A ALSO FOREIGN POLICY YOU LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES THAT HAVE COME. JIM MATTIS APPARENTLY SAYING THAT THE NATO MEETING WAS A WRONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS THAT HE'S EVER SEEN. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND WHAT THE U.S. NEEDS TO DO WITH RUSSIA GIVEN THESE HORRIBLE STORIES WE JUST HEARD ABOUT PUTIN FROM BILL BROWDER. YEAH, PUTIN IS A BAD GUY. HE'S NOT OUR FRIEND. I THINK WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT ARE THE ACTIONS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN TO STAND UP AGAINST PUTIN AND TO STAND UP AGAINST RUSSIA AND THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT MARIA. IF YOU START WITH THE UKRAINE THEY'RE OUR FRIEND IN EASTERN EUROPE. EUROPE AND BARACK OBAMA SAT ON THE SIDELINES. THOSE COUNTRIES BY THE WAY THEY DIDN'T SAY GIVE US BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THEY SAID CAN YOU JUST SELL US ARMS SO WE CAN PUSHBACK AGAINST THE RUSSIANS AGGRESSION AND BOMB THEIR TANKS, AND OBAMA SAID NO PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID YES AND ACTUALLY SOLD THEM THOSE MISSILE S SO THEY CAN DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY AND PUSH RUSSIA OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE AND THAT'S INCREASED SANCTIONS AGAINST WE NEED TO KEEP REMINDING RUSSIA THEY'RE NOT OUR FRIEND AND GET OUT OF SYRIA, STOP ALLYING WITH SOME OF THESE ROGUE COUNTRIES. MARIA: KEVIN BRADY WAS ON THIS PROGRAM LAST WEEK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE HE WILL TRY TO GET A VOTE ON TAX CUTS 2.0 TO THE FLOOR IN SEPTEMBER. DO YOU THINK HE'LL NEED DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT HERE? IS ANYBODY GOING TO VOTE FOR TAX CUTS 2.0 WHEN THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT DEFICITS AND THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR TAX CUTS 1? EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT SHOULD VOTE FOR TAX CUTS 2.0. MARIA: BUT THEY WON'T. BECAUSE IT'S WORKED FOR OUR CHAIRMAN BRADY IS DOING IS WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CUTS INCLUDE ALL OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY GROWING. WE'RE SEEING HISTORIC GROWTH LET'S KEEP IT GROWING. IT'LL PASS THE HOUSE. THE REAL QUESTION IS WILL EVERY DEMOCRAT VOTE LIKE LAST TIME NOW KNOWING HOW WELL IT'S WORKING FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. MARIA: IT'S A WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR SURE.
