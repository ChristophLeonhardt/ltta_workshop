Emmanuel macron has lashed out at Frances media over its handling of the scandal involving the president's top security aide that's after the French leader said he was taking responsibility for his bodyguard attacking a protester Charlotte Dubinski picks up the story well in the last week French media has been in a complete frenzy over this scandal which emerged involving macrons top secret Alexandre Piniella well bonala has since been sacked and on Tuesday we heard for the first time what president Matt Warren made of this affair he said to a group of his deputies of love a public on mash that the buck stopped with him that he and only he mr. Blaine but then he turned round and then made blame at the press in the way that they've covered this story essentially saying that the press and commentators were acting like the judiciary and we're not looking to seek out the truth we have media that no longer seeks the truth the images are they shown with a desire to uncover the truth to present facts in a balanced manner no I see media powers who want to become judicial ones well we know that president macron and president Trump of the United States have been pretty chummy for a long time but it seems now that president macro might be taking a leaf out of Donald Trump's books in the way that he deals with the mainstream media we know that Donald Trump has been at war with the mainstream media since before he was even elected as fake news I don't take questions from sins I'm against the people that make up stories the level of dishonesty is out of control very effective the fake news doesn't want to talk about it BuzzFeed which is a failing pile of garbage writing it I think they're gonna suffer the consequences I'm not gonna give you a question you are fake news well some may think it's not the best idea for president macron to follow in the footsteps of a president Trump and we also know that President macarons approval ratings have dropped since this scandal emerged now the Russian media is long been familiar with criticism and being under fire from president Matt Khan but it now seems that that fire and that criticism is extending now to all media outlets in France an Elizabeth morte who's a columnist for Britain's The Sunday Telegraph believes macron is trying to shift the blame despite taking responsibility it reverts to the usual attitude of politicians when they are caught on something too late and he accuses the media that exist before Trump amitav holders did that in France she hog did that in France we've seen this before it's not especially a Trump specialty so we can expect something a the you know of this government but it certainly is the first time that this government has taken a wrong footed in in a media spin situation up till now they did very well the media love them and they're they just let this lapse for a week and that's completely uncharacteristic of them you
