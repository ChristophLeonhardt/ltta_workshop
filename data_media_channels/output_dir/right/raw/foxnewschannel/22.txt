19
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:28,852
IT'S DESPICABLE.

20
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:29,486
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENCE OF

21
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,321
OPINION ON THINGS BUT THERE

22
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,923
SHOULD BE NO VIOLENCE AND AN

23
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:35,759
ATTACK LIKE THIS ON ONE PERSON

24
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,360
AND ONE AMERICAN IS AN ATTACK ON

25
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:37,727
ALL OF US.

26
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:38,828
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT

27
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,830
AND IT GOT TO BE HELD

28
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:41,231
ACCOUNTABLE.

29
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:41,965
>> Shannon: I UNDERSTAND THAT

30
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:43,233
FOR THE MOST PART THE

RESOURCES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

41
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:58,481
NEEDS TO DO A REVIEW LIKE THIS.

42
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:00,383
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT

43
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,319

44
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,453

THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE

47
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:08,158
DISAGREEMENTS.

48
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,860
BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO -- CAN'T

49
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,428
BE ANY VIOLENCE.

50
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,029
>> Shannon: HOW CAN WE DIAL IT

51
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,330
BACK?

52
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,364
YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TOUGH

53
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,598
CAMPAIGN WHICH WE ARE GOING TO

54
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,934
TALK ABOUT, BUT DO YOU THINK

55
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,035
THERE IS A MESSAGE TO OUR FELLOW

56
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:19,903
AMERICANS THAT WE CAN ALL

57
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:21,404
SOMEHOW GET ON THE SAME PAGE AND

58
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:23,807
GET AWAY FROM THOSE EXTREMES?

59
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:25,508
>> I THINK WHAT WE GOT TO DO IS

60
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,846
JUST REALIZED THAT WE ALL HAVE

61
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:32,615
TO HAVE OUR BELIEFS.

62
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,050
IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT I'M GOING

67
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,057
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE STORIES

68
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,259
OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE HELPING EACH

00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:47,430
ARE SAYING DO YOU NEED A

75
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:53,169
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME

76
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,305
UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY JUST TO

77
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:55,839
FEED OTHER PEOPLE.

78
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,040
THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE

79
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,275
DOING, WE OUGHT TO BE COMING

80
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:00,276

82
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,545
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE I KNOW

83
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:04,647
THOSE FOLKS ARE VERY HARDWORKING

84
00:02:04,648 --> 00:02:06,883
AND RESILIENT AS WELL.

85
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:07,817
THE LAST CHECK IN WITH THE REAL

86
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:11,688
CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE HAS YOU

87
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,858

88
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:15,158
48.2%.

89
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,459
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS TO GO, HOW

90
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,230
DO YOU HOPE TO CLOSE THE GAP?

91
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:20,997
>> IT'S A CLEAR CHOICE.

92
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:23,133
WE ARE GOING TO WIN.

93
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:25,068
SOMEBODY ASKED ME TODAY, THEY

94
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:25,902
SAID WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

95
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:28,104
IN MY CASE I'M A WORKER.

96
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:30,673
IN SENATOR NELSON'S CASE HE

97
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:31,241
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

98
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:33,009
HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING.

99
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,211
HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR 42 YEARS,

100
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:35,979
NOTHING ON EDUCATION, NOTHING ON

101
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,081
THE ENVIRONMENT, NOTHING ON

102
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:38,548
TRANSPORTATION.

103
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,383
HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

104
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:43,052
AND HERE'S WHAT HE DID WITH THIS

105
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:43,420
HURRICANE.

106
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:44,454
HE DID A FEW PHOTO OPS FOR THREE

107
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,589
OR FOUR DAYS AND HE SAYS I'M

108
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,358
DONE, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN

109
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:48,858
DO.

110
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:50,693
AT THE REALITY IS THE FEDERAL

111
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:51,861

00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:54,063
GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE AND HE

114
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:56,599
SHOULD BE HELPING.

115
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,635
TOMORROW I WILL BE WITH

119
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,777
SENATOR NELSON HAS DONE NOTHING

120
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:09,879
TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOING TO GET

121
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,647
REBUILT BUT I WILL BE THERE WITH

AROUND SINCE THE 1840s AND

156
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:04,467
IT'S NATURALLY OCCURRING.

157

BUNCH OF THINGS TO HELP ALL OF

SENATOR NELSON HAS NEVER DONE

161
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:10,907
ONE THING.

162
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:12,542
WE'VE ALSO HAD ISSUE OR WE HAVE

WITHOUT ALGAE ISSUES BECAUSE

168
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,854
BILL NELSON DOESN'T DO HIS JOB.

169
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:25,622
WE HAVE FUNDED A FEDERAL PROJECT

170
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:28,024
TO STOP IT AND ACTUALLY ONCE

171
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,093

BUT HE WILL NEVER DO ANYTHING

180
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,102
ABOUT IT.

181
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:40,436

191
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,249
THAT'S THE WORK HE USED, HE SAID

192
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,853
YOU ARE A LIAR.

193
00:04:56,854 --> 00:04:58,187
>> IT'S PERSONAL TO ME.

194
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,489
I GREW UP NOT KNOWING MY DAD.

195
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,690
I HAD A BROTHER WITH A

196
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,492
SIGNIFICANT DISEASE.

197
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:03,593
MY MOM DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH CARE

198
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,463
OUR HEALTH INSURANCE -- SHE

199
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:08,631
COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY TO TAKE

200
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:09,666
CARE OF MY BROTHER.

201
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,267
SHE FINALLY FOUND A CHARITY

202
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:12,268
HOSPITAL FOUR HOURS AWAY.

203
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,269
SO I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE OUGHT

204
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,638
TO HAVE A RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE.

205
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,840
HE SHOULDN'T BE DENIED OR

206
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:18,541
HEALTH CARE INSURANCE IF YOU

207
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,577
HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.

208
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:23,446
HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE, SENATOR

209
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:24,247
SENATOR NELSON WAS A STATEHOUSE

210
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,081
MEMBER, NEVER DID ANYTHING ABOUT

211
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:25,348
IT.

212
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,784
HE WAS THE STATE INSURANCE

213
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,518
COMMISSIONER, NEVER DID ANYTHING

214
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,852
ABOUT IT.

215
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:30,920
HE WAS A CONGRESSMAN, DID

216
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:31,421
NOTHING ABOUT IT.

217
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:33,690
WHEN THEY VOTED FOR WHAT WE

218
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:35,258
COULD CALL THE UNAFFORDABLE

219
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,693
HEALTH CARE ACT IT WAS TWO

220
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:37,860
LITTLE GOOD PIECES IN THE BILL.

221
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:39,295
YOU SHOULD NOT BE DENIED

222
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,663
HEALTH CARE IF YOU HAVE A

223
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:41,297
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.

224
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,865
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAY ON

225
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:43,967
YOUR PARENTS PLAN, BUT THE REST

226
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,035
OF THE BILL IS A DISASTER.

227
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:48,338
BILL NELSON HAS NEVER DONE

228
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,072
ANYTHING TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE

229
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:51,474
OTHER THAN MAKE THE COST GO UP,

230
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,343
DEDUCTIBLES GO UP, PREMIUMS GO

231
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:54,544
UP AND COPAYMENTS GO UP.

232
00:05:54,545 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Shannon: WE WISH YOU ALL
