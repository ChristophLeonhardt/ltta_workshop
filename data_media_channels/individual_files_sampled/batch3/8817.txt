THEY TRIED TO SCARE ME. BUT IT GIVES ME POWER AND AWAY. I LOVE HILLARY, I LOVE EVERYONE, BUT THE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A GUY THAT COULD PLAY CATCH WITH HIS SON. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT ONE UP AT THIS HAT ON AND IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN. YOU MADE A SUPERMAN. THAT'S MY FAVORITE SUPERHERO. THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING. I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING, THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY, CONNIE WEST EXPRESSING HIS SUPPORT AMONG OTHER THINGS. THAT IS WHERE WE WILL START WITH OUR PANEL. JOSH CRUSH HOUR, POLITICAL EDITOR FOR THE NATIONAL JOURNAL, AMY WALTER, NASH MONITORED HER FOR THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT AND MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST. SO WHAT DOES THAT DO? IT WAS A SURREAL MOMENT ON TV, WE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT DOES FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, OR THE ELECTION IN ANY WAY? IT CERTAINLY WAS A SURREAL MOMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP LOVES CELEBRITY. HE LOVED THE BEACH BOYS AND HAD ANOTHER CELEBRITY IN THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY BUT IT REMINDED ME THAT IT COULD BE A LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. IF YOU FOCUSED ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM WHICH WAS WHY CONNIE WEST WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE FIRST PLACE, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY EARLY ON IN HIS PRESIDENCY TO EXPAND HIS COALITION AND WENT OVER SOME AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO THE TRUMP SIDE. IT WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT WHERE WE HAD ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS AFRICAN-AMERICAN CELEBRITIES HUGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT'S LATE IN THE GAME FOR THAT AND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THIS CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THIS PRESIDENT. THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME OPPORTUNITIES AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE MIDTERMS WERE TRYING TO BUILD SOME NEW SUPPORTERS BUT I DON'T THINK HE WILL MOVE A WHOLE LOT POLITICALLY. WHAT WAS INTERESTING, WHAT HE JUST SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT PUTTING ON THAT GIVES HIM POWER. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING IN OUR CULTURE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF CRITICISM OF BEING A CONSERVATIVE, A TON OF CRITICISM FOR BEING A TRUMP SUPPORTER BUT IF YOU CAN WITHSTAND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING EMPOWERING ABOUT IT. KANYE IS INTERESTING AND HE IS ALWAYS INTERESTING AND SAYS THINGS IN A WEIRD WAY, BUT I THINK THE REASON YOU ARE SEEING SO MUCH NEGATIVE REACTION IS BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT HE IS RAISING. YOU HAVE A VERY POPULAR CELEBRITY ALIGNING HIMSELF WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THERE'S SOMETHING VERY ALARMING ABOUT THAT. YOU SEE TONS OF HISPANIC SUPPORTING TED CRUZ, TONS OF HISPANICS SUPPORTING DEAN KELLER. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE FEEL VERY NERVOUS ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT PLAY THE PARTS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO. TO THAT POINT, SOME OTHER COMMENTATORS WEIGHING IN ON WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY WITH KANYE WEST. KANYE WEST IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DON'T READ IT. BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN BECAUSE HE PUT ON A HAT AND HE'S ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW THE MODEL SPOKESPERSON OR TOKEN OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE THAT LIBERALS TRY TO DO, LIBERALS TRY TO CONTROL THE BLACK PERSON TO THE CONCEPT OF RACISM BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE VERY PROUD OF, EMOTIONAL PEOPLE. SO WHEN I SAY I LIKE TRUMP TO SOMEONE THAT'S A LIBERAL, THEY SAY, HE'S RACIST. YOU THINK RACISM CAN CONTROL ME? THAT DOESN'T STOP ME. Bret: IT'S SUCH AN EXPLOSIVE THING TO TALK ABOUT. BUT HOW DOES THIS PLAY? I JUST THINK WE ARE BACK WHERE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN, AND THE DISCUSSION OF TWO AMERICAS AND A POLARIZED AMERICA, AND I DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO GET RAISE RAISED, AND KIM KARDASHIAN AND HIS WIFE OF COURSE CAME IN AND ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT ISSUES RELATED TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. INSTEAD, THIS BECOMES ABOUT WHO HIS TEAM ARE YOU ON. THE ENTIRE TRUMP PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN BASICALLY ABOUT PICKING HER ASIDE AND PICKING OUR TEAM, AND FOR KANYE TO PUT THE RED HAT ON, HE IS LITERALLY SAYING I'M GOING AGAINST MY TEAM AND THERE IS A BACKLASH TO THAT, IN THE SAME WAY THAT REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SAID OR WHO WERE NORMALLY READY TO GO INTO THE BLUE TEAM, THEY GET THE CRITICISM FOR DOING THAT. THERE IS NOTHING LEFT, THERE IS THE ELECTION WILL JUST FURTHER GET US INTO THESE DEEP, DEEP, POLAR AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE. EARLIER THIS MORNING, DONALD TRUMP CALLED INTO FOX AND FRIENDS AND HAD A LENGTHY CONVERSATION. SHE WAS REFERENCING CONNIE'S APPEARANCE. KIM CAME TO THE OVAL OFFICE AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY VERY EFFECTIVE AT GETTING THAT SENTENCE COMMUTED. BUT THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING NOW AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE THEM ON THE RIGHT BECAUSE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT PREVIOUSLY JUST PEOPLE ON THE LEFT WERE TALKING ABOUT. YOU SEE A LOT OF GOOD TO ELEMENTS WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT MANDATORY MINIMUMS AND HOW WE ADJUDICATE VARIOUS CASES. AND IT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THIS. THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT TO THIS IS SITTING IN HIS CABINET AND THAT'S JEFF SESSIONS. REPUBLICANS WANT TO PASS THIS AND HAVE ENOUGH VOTES IN SENATE TO PASS THIS. BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THE REAL REASON WHY A LOT OF THE STUFF ISN'T GETTING DONE. Bret: LET ME TURN TO THE BIG INTERNATIONAL STORY, DISMISSING SAUDI JOURNALISTS. LET'S SEE HOW THE U.S. IS DEALING WITH IT. WE ARE LOOKING AT IT VERY STRONGLY AND WE WILL HAVE A REPORT OUT SOON. WE ARE WORKING WITH TURKEY AND SAUDI ARABIA. WHAT HAPPENED WAS A TERRIBLE THING, ASSUMING THAT HAPPENED. MAYBE WE WILL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BUT SOMEHOW I DOUBT IT. I TALKED TO SENATOR CORKER AND CARDIN AND THERE WILL BE A BIPARTISAN TSUNAMI BILL AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA HERE, IF THEY DID IN FACT DO THIS. IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE LEFT ALIVE AND IT'S TIME FOR THE UNITED STATES TO LAY DOWN SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SAUDIS. Bret: THIS IS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JAMAAL KHASHOGGI AND "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND INTELLIGENCE SOURCES ARE SAYING THAT HE ORDERED THE ACTION. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH WHAT HAS BEEN AN IMPROVING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KINGDOM. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO WANT AND I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY THE PRESIDENT'S PASSIVITY AND NOT REALLY CALLING OUT SAUDI ARABIA. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL MORE FACTS BECOME AVAILABLE BUT, LIKE A LOT OF FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT EATING FROM BEHIND TO COME AT THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS. HE SAW LINDSEY GRAHAM AND MARCO RUBIO, SOME OF THE HOCKS ON THE SENATE SIDE THAT WANT ACTION. THEY MIGHT WANT SANCTIONS, BUT THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT. JARED KUSHNER HAS HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAUDI LEADERSHIP AND I THINK THEY HAVE A LOT AT STAKE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THAT. I THINK THE MESSAGE TODAY WAS, LET'S SEE WHERE THIS TAKES US, WHERE WE KNOW TO BE FACTS. OBVIOUSLY THERE IS INTELLIGENCE THAT WE ARE NOT SEEN. THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, HOW ARE WE GOING TO KNOW ACTUALLY, WILL HE FEEL LIKE IT IS A VERY DEFINITIVE CASE THAT CAN BE TOLD? WE MAY GET MORE INTELLIGENT, BUT IF SO THE ACTION WOULD BE AS JOSH POINTED OUT THAT THING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS VERY HESITANT TO DO. WHICH IS STOP ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA. YOU COULD HAVE A REALLY TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAUDI INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOW, THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD MILITARILY IF THE U.S. DID PUT SANCTIONS ON SOON. I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY MUCH JUMPING THE GUN. BOTH TURKEY AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE ALLIES AND THEY HAVE THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS. TURKEY'S PRESIDENT HAS IMPRISONED SOMETHING NORTH OF 160 JOURNALISTS THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD JUST TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD, THAT THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON SEEMS REALLY PREMATURE. WHEN YOU ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH ALLIES, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE FOCUSED ON YOUR NATIONAL INTEREST. KIDNAPPING OR KILLING A JOURNALIST IS A HORRIBLE THING. IT HAPPENS A LOT, IT'S NOT WORSE IF IT HAPPENS TO A JOURNALIST AND SOMEONE ELSE BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT
