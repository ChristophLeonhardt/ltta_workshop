00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:01,517
- [Narrator] Bitcoin's meteoric rise

2
00:00:01,517 --> 00:00:03,771
is attracting a ton of attention,

3
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:06,688
but is it ready for the mainstream?

4
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:12,156
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie
Dimon recently called Bitcoin

5
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:14,708
a fraud and said that
cryptocurrency prices

6
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:17,836
are in a bubble that
will eventually burst.

7
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:20,102
Many investors have
stayed on the sidelines

8
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,804
as cryptocurrencies are
seen as too volatile

9
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:26,828
and don't have the safeguards
that most financial assets do.

10
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,834
A number of hedge funds,
however, are investing

11
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,768
in cryptocurrencies, and
Goldman Sachs is reportedly

12
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,451
exploring how it can help
clients trade digital tokens.

13
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,089
Other companies are stepping up efforts

14
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,540
to bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream,

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,723
opening regulated exchanges,
creating futures contracts

16
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:46,004
and attempting to list
exchange traded funds.

17
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,983
The recent surge in cryptocurrency prices

18
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,956
has coincided with a flood of interest

19
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:52,702
about the blockchain
technology behind Bitcoin,

20
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:55,009
which uses a decentralized
and public ledger

21
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,049
of transactions that can't be manipulated.

22
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,700
IBM, Microsoft and Toyota have
all invested in blockchain

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,812
and are looking at potential applications

24
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:07,663
ranging from food safety
to driverless cars.

25
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:11,537
So what is preventing even
more widespread adoption?

26
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:14,204
Regulation, or the lack thereof.

27
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:19,330
In July 2017, the SEC announced
that federal securities law

28
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,124
may apply to some cryptocurrencies,

29
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,810
without providing concrete guidelines

30
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,910
to determine which ones.

31
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,506
Meanwhile, China has outright banned ICOs,

32
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,319
or Initial Coin Offerings,
along with the exchanges

33
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,622
where coins are traded.

34
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:35,815
Guidelines for individuals
that mine and trade

35
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:38,419
cryptocurrencies also vary wildly,

36
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:40,394
with countries like Venezuela going as far

37
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:42,533
as putting miners in jail.

38
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,547
So what's next in the year ahead?

39
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:46,995
The cryptocurrency community
is eager for clarity

40
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:51,552
from regulators on ICOs,
trading, mining and taxes.

41
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:54,097
As that happens, more
investors and end users

42
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:56,587
could dip their toes in the water.

43
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:59,304
Many have compared the
current state of blockchain

44
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,055
to the early days of the internet,

45
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:03,647
a digital wild west
teeming with opportunity

46
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:05,014
and just like the internet,

47
00:02:05,014 --> 00:00:00,000
there will likely be winners and losers.
