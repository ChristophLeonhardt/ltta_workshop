here we go second gear third gear come on fourth gear driving stick it's a dying skill here in the United States but still something you might want to know how to do and as luck would have it we have an $80,000 Jaguar f-type with a standard transmission to learn on so in a car with a standard transmission you have in addition to the gas pedal and the brake metal an additional pedal a third pedal and that's the clutch so when you drive in the car what you have to do is every time you want to change gears you need to put the clutch in with your foot like that and the reason you're doing this is because you're disengaging the transmission from the engine so that you can go to a different gear so you're starting out cars in first gear and you got the clutch in give it a little bit of gas slowly let the clutch out until it grabs and then the car is on its way and for most people this is the most difficult part of the whole process what happens with people when they first start trying to do this and they first start learning stick is they stall the car write book just stall it because I came out of the clutch too fast oh this is cool this is cool I stalled it and the car started itself back up that's a nice feature it's a feel thing once you stop stalling the car and you get used to how you're gonna give it a little bit of gas and let the clutch out in first gear you know you get yourself from first to second then you accelerate a little bit more then you go to third accelerate a little bit more off the gas into the clutch down into fourth a little bit faster work your way up to fifth and this car you can drop it down into sixth as well shifting down into second gear now here it comes third gear one mile per hour I'm currently going one mile per hour and I'm in first gear this is probably the best opportunity I've had to illustrate do I think it's stick shift you know horrible traffic so this is the this is the reason why people don't like stick shifts at you here we go second year third gear come on fourth gear that's like
