1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
secretary minuchin I know you're here to
talk about a lot of issues having to do

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,210
with tax reform and North Korea
sanctions etc we'll get to those in a

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,120
section but but I do want to get your
reaction to this president Trump seems

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,450
to be calling for a boycott of the NFL
he's also calling for players who take a

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,790
knee
to protest what they see as racial

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,470
inequities to be fired or suspended
what's your reaction to what we're

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,510
seeing at Wembley Stadium in London
right now good morning and great to be

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,150
here with you the NFL has all different
types of rules you can't have stickers

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,550
on your helmet you have to have your
uniforms tucked in what the president is

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,450
saying and I think the owner should meet
and they should vote on a rule this is

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,789
about respect for our military this is
about respect for our first responders

12
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,440
this is not about Republicans or
Democrats players have the right for

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,989
free speech off the field on the field
this is about respect for lots of people

14
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,430
and I don't understand why there's rules
that when the Dallas Cowboys wanted to

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,420
put stickers on their helmets out of
respect for people there they couldn't

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,409
do it but now the NFL is saying people
should be able to decide what they want

17
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,590
to do and disrespect the United States
flag well to play devil's advocate here

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,900
first of all these players don't think
they're disrespecting the United States

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,200
flag they think that they are engaging
in peaceful protest of what they see is

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,150
racial oppression and inequities and as
you know Roger Goodell the head of the

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,240
NFL and all a whole host of team owners
including Robert Kraft who is a friend

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,689
of President Trump have issued
statements supporting their players

23
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,210
right to do this and criticizing the
president's comments including Robert

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,340
Kraft specifically criticizing the
president's tone why is this a fight

25
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,470
that the president wants to have I don't
think it's a question of a fight that

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,460
the president wants to have he thinks
this is about respect for the military

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,509
and so many people who put their lives
at risk and what the country stands for

28
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,649
and the owner should meet and they
should decide on this rule the way they

29
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,000
decide on any other rule again you know
for as long as I can remember people

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,470
have stood in honor of the country this
isn't about politics if people want to

31
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,950
talk politics off the field when they're
not working for the NF

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,069
they have the absolute right to do that
all right I could do the whole interview

33
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,370
on this topic but there are some other
big pressing issues let's talk about

34
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,209
healthcare three Republican senators
john mccain susan collins rand paul have

35
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,890
expressed strong disapproval of the
gramm cassidy bill Rand Paul did open

36
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,590
the door this morning to backing the
bill if it undergoes a major change

37
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,140
getting rid of block grants is President
Trump if well let's talk about that

38
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,900
first of all is president Trump willing
to get rid of the Block Grant part of

39
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,970
this bill in order to win the support of
Senator Paul I I think the president

40
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,230
hasn't made any decisions on that what
the president has decided is Obamacare

41
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,030
is broken the taxes are going to start
hitting people the penalties are going

42
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,280
to start hitting people the premiums are
going up

43
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,690
Republicans have campaigned on repeal
and replace which the president is on

44
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,190
board and I think it's unfortunate that
last time it came down to one vote and

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,459
this time it's gonna be very close I
hope it passes if it does not pass is

46
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,359
President Trump
ready to work with Democrats to actually

47
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,410
do something to fix the problems in
Obamacare as you know there is a

48
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,639
bipartisan effort right now between
senators Alexander and patty Murray of

49
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,959
Washington State Senator Collins was
talking that up earlier today when she

50
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,790
suggested she would be in all likelihood
a no on Graham Cassidy is a bipartisan

51
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,319
approach the next approach if Graham
Cassidy fails I think the president's

52
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,190
always willing to work on a bipartisan
basis as you know we had an important

53
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,519
meeting in the Oval Office where the
president cut a deal right after the

54
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,079
Hurricanes I think we have I know we
have a meeting on taxes at the White

55
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,120
House on Tuesday with Republicans and
Democrats from the Ways and Means part I

56
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,319
think unfortunately the Democrats on
health care have put very high demands

57
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,639
on they don't want to change many
aspects of Obama care but to the extent

58
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,199
they're willing to come to the table and
fix it I think that's the president

59
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,269
would always listen to we're about
fixing Obamacare it's broken and it

60
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,108
requires people to do lots of things
that that they just shouldn't be forced

61
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,159
to do let's turn to the president's tax
agenda the president is expected to roll

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,289
out a tax plan on Wednesday
Axios is reporting that the plan would

63
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,580
cut the tax rate paid by the wealthy
Americans

64
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,250
from almost 40% to about 35% as well as
making dramatic reductions on taxes on

65
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,150
big businesses small businesses when you
were selected as Treasury secretary you

66
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,080
made a very specific promise it was
quickly dubbed the minuchin rule take a

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,039
listen
any reductions we have in upper income

68
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,590
taxes will be offset by less deductions
so that there will be no tax absolute

69
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,479
tax cut for the upper class can you
reassure me that there will be quote no

70
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,610
absolute tax cut for the upper class as
the manoosh enrolls still in effect I

71
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,789
did say that I just want to clarify it
was never a promise it was never a

72
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,440
pledge what it was and it is still it
was what the president's objective was

73
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,759
now we've been working with the
bipartisan leadership we look forward to

74
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,530
releasing the plan this week I think
what's important about this plan is it

75
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,169
creates a middle-income tax cut it makes
businesses competitive and it creates

76
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,910
jobs that's what this is all about and
as it relates to the high end you know

77
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,449
there's lots of changes we're getting
rid of lots of deductions we're trying

78
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,570
to get rid of state and local deductions
to get the federal government out of

79
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,699
subsidizing it and yes I can tell you
the current plan for many many people it

80
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,870
will not reduce taxes on the high end
let's start at North Korea you said on

81
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,919
Friday that new sanctions on North Korea
are not directed specifically at China

82
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,880
but a broader question given the China
is by far in North Korea's largest

83
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,930
trading partner and president Trump has
said the China needs to do more

84
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,389
shouldn't the sanctions be directed at
China well the President signed an

85
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,250
executive order is very very significant
it gives the Treasury more authorities

86
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,169
than we've ever had before it allows us
to block many transactions with anybody

87
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,669
that does trade or other significant
business with North Korea it gives us

88
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,419
the ability to block financial
institutions that facilitate the

89
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:24,550
president is very committed to blocking
economic transactions and that's what

90
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,360
this is all about all right
Treasury secretary Steve minuchin thank

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:00:00,000
you so much really appreciate your being
here sir great to be here thank you
