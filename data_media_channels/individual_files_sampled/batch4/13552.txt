president Trump having his big immigration meeting at the White House so there were two purposes for this immigration meeting purpose number one is to push back on the Michael wolf fire and fury narratives that narrative which we talked about at length yesterday suggest that Trump is just a crazy person Trump is a nut job a child and a man body a sort of a kook who's escaped from the asylum and is now running amuck through the White House destroying everything and so Trump wanted to hold this bipartisan meeting to show no you know I'm gonna have a basically normal meeting and we'll have a bunch of Democrats to the White House and we'll talk and nobody'll get hit in the head with a frying pan it'll totally be fine and in that he succeeded he was fine when it came into policy however things were not quite so glowing and president gave a bunch of mixed signals about what he would be willing to sign or what he would not be willing to sign in terms of daca now it's a review if you recall back in twenty sixty two back in 2012 Barack Obama passed into law sort of through executive order the executive amnesty this was the deferred action for childhood arrivals program it suggested that anyone between the ages of 16 and 30 at the time that he signed this into law that those people would be able to stay if they were brought into the country as children who had been there for a certain amount of time and that being the case all those people would eventually be legal citizens of the United States was sort of the unspoken promise that Obama was making so Trump comes into office and several months into his term he decides that he is going to overturn daca but at the time he says daca no longer applies but if Congress doesn't pass some version of daca to keep the so-called dreamers in the United States then come March maybe I'll just reinstate it which is a weird statement to make because the whole reason for striking down data in the first place was based on constitutional grounds he said it's unconstitutional for the President of the United States to simply say that a bunch of people are now going to get green cards to stay in the United States or papers that suggest that they can be her legally without the approval of Congress so it would be weird to reverse himself and then say well you know what I decided the constitutional question doesn't matter now I want this policy back in place and therefore it will be back in place that would be a weird argument for Trump to make so yesterday Trump is at the White House and he leads off with his actual proposed
