of course what happens is is the facts come in frequently it turns out there was a law on the books oh the guy slipped through nothing that they do would have made any difference but they doesn't change anything they never changed their tune that one guy that you saw Philip Mudd who's the counterterrorism expert on CNN who was making a speech about how Tokyo and Europe are so much better than we are about this he had this moment when he just completely fell apart play that clip I have 10 nieces and nephews we're talking about bump stocks we're talking about legislation a child of God is dead cannot we acknowledge in this country that we can't we cannot accept this I can't do a wolf absurd we can't do it normally I would make fun of this guy because this is CNN CNN is news people coming on and their lips tremble and their eyes fill and that is supposed to take the place of some kind of conversation I'm not gonna make fun of them because I I'm not blaming him for crying you know this is I'm gonna get a little abstract here because I'd actually don't want to sit around talking about those the shooting which is always again always the same horrible atrocious story as the last one but you know one of the reasons that that Plato didn't trust writing is he said you have to be able to look at a man to get the truth you know he should writing was a new technology and he basically said you know I it's it's going to ruin our memories and it's going to this separate us from the guy who talks and the thing is it's nothing wrong obviously with crime even on the air caught breaking down over these dead children who wouldn't it that's what tears are for but the thing that you say in the way that you say it are two separate things that affect one another I mean just a simple example if I'm trying to explain to our producer Rob that two plus two equals four and he just can't get it I may lose my temper and say damn it two plus two equals four right and you know that two plus two the words that are coming out of my mouth are literally true the tone in which I'm saying them is suggesting that Rob is dense or that he's there's something wrong with him that's not true that's so the my emotions are untrue in that case my words are literally right you know bluntly true that's all if you just put that down on paper as right you wouldn't see what had really happened there and that was plato's objection basically one of his objections in this case it's the other way around the emotions are quite reasonable completely reasonable but that has nothing to do with the words that are coming out of his mouth about bump stocks and we don't know if there were bump stocks news we don't know anything about this or whether any of this would do anything and that has become the way that issues are discussed
