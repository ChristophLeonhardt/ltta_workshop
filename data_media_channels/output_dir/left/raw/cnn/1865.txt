00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
dr. Kimmel let me just start with you
that story after all of that then trying

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,039
to get through waist-deep water to get
there

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,429
I tell us about that journey well I had
a hard time getting there on my own and

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:21,869
the hospital was able to get ahold of
the local volunteer fire department so

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,670
William and Kevin knocked on my door
and he said we're gonna run for a while

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,969
doc so we we ran through the through the
flooded streets and it was pretty windy

7
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,870
and rainy and then as you said we went
by canoe and then by waves pickup truck

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:48,530
and by canoe again and I felt that these
guys knew what they were doing so I

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:54,030
didn't worry about myself at all the
whole time and we got there in pretty

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,710
good time considering how we had to go
I mean Jacob were you surprised that dr.

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,160
Kimmel was was there I mean I know you
and your family must have had to worry

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,780
that as hard as it was for you to get
there it must have been just as hard for

13
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,549
the doctor that was so crucial to you
yes it was kind of weird cuz I got there

14
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,820
and I didn't know who was the doctor
because he got here I thought he was

15
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:25,770
just like some I don't know just some
dude and that's what my mom thought too

16
00:01:25,770 --> 00:00:00,000
and once he told me I was like oh okay I
wasn't dressed like this
