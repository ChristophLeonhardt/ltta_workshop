1
00:00:00,528 --> 00:00:03,163
MCCOWAN TEXAS, A FEW FAMILY

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:04,398
UNITS COMING ACROSS.

3
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:06,901
LET ME TOUCH ON THE IMAGES WE'RE

4
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:09,203
SEEING FROM GUATEMALA.

5
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:10,938
SECRETARY POMPEO HAVING A

6
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,139
MEETING WITH MEXICAN OFFICIALS.

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,642
THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND

8
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:16,143
IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS HERE ALSO

9
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:17,912
PLAYING A PART IN THOSE TALKS.

10
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:19,914
WHEN YOU TALK TO OFFICIALS DOWN

11
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:21,749
HERE, THEY'RE OPTIMISTIC TO SEE

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,083
THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION FROM

13
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:25,319
THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IN

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
ATTEMPTING TO ASSIST IN KEEPING

15
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:29,356
THAT CARAVAN FROM REACHING OUR

16
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:30,858
BORDER WHICH IS HUNDREDS OF

17
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,359
MILES FROM WHERE I'M STANDING.

18
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,328
AS YOU SEE FROM THAT RIVER IN

19
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,630
GUATEMALA, IT'S VERY POROUS,

20
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:39,366
MUCH LIKE THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY

21
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,869
RIVER HERE THAT MIGRANTS HAVE

22
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,773
BEEN COMING ACROSS ALL DAY.

23
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:47,808
THEY ARE STREAMING 500, 600

24
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:49,376
OFFICIALS DOWN THERE TO STOP IT.

25
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:51,111
THEY HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES.

26
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:53,047
OFFICIALS VERY ENCOURAGED TO SEE

27
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:55,215
THEM TRY AND HELP IN A WAY THEY

28
00:00:55,216 --> 00:00:56,650
HAVEN'T REALLY HELPED THAT MUCH

29
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:58,786
IN RECENT HISTORY IN TRYING TO

30
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:00,688
STAVE OFF THE OVERFLOW OF

31
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:03,123
IMMIGRANTS COMING.

32
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:03,424
DANA?

33
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:06,427
>> Dana: GRIFF, WHAT IS IT LIKE

34
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:07,328
WHERE YOU ARE?

35
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,097
IT LOOKS CALM, BUT I KNOW THOSE

36
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:11,899
AGENTS HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL.

37
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,701
>> Reporter: IT'S BEEN VERY BUSY

38
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:15,803
ALL MORNING LONG.

39
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:17,604
WE HAVE SEEN FOUR OR FIVE

40
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:19,006
DIFFERENT GROUPS.

41
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:22,910
WE'VE MADE ARRESTS OF 20, 30,

42
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:23,811
35.

43
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:24,678
OFFICIALS TELL ME THE AVERAGE

44
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:27,948
NUMBER OF ARRESTS, ILLEGAL

45
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:29,049
CROSSING ARRESTS IN THIS SECTOR

46
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,020
OF THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY IS OVER

47
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:34,355
640 A DAY.

48
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:36,090
IT IS AN UNBELIEVABLE

49
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,091
OVERWHELMING NUMBER.

50
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:40,627
SINCE THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE

51
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:42,997
FAMILY UNIT THAT HAS JUST COME

52
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:44,798
ACROSS BECAUSE I CAN'T SHOW YOU,

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,834
THEY'VE SEEN A 300% INCREASE.

54
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:50,270
SO EVEN BEFORE THAT CARAVAN GETS

55
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:53,207
HERE, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A

56
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,808
FLOODING BORDER RIGHT HERE AND

57
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:56,210
OFFICIALS TRYING TO GET THIS

58
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:58,145
UNDER CONTROL WILL HAVE TO DEAL

59
00:01:58,146 --> 00:02:00,848
WITH THINGS LIKE THAT CARAVAN,

60
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,216
SHOULD THEY SHOW UP.

61
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:04,118
SO OUR VIEWERS UNDERSTAND, IF

62
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,620
YOU SHOW UP AND CLAIM ASYLUM,

63
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:09,223
YOU WILL BE GIVEN A FAIR

64
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:09,555
HEARING.

65
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:10,390
THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE SOME OF

66
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:13,394
THE CARAVAN MAY DO.

67
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:16,530
WHEN YOU HAVE 640 ILLEGAL

68
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,332
CROSSERS EVERY MORNING THAT

69
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,467
BORDER PATROL HAS TO CHASE, IT'S

70
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:22,536
QUITE A TASK AND ONE THE

71
00:02:22,537 --> 00:00:00,000
ADMINISTRATION IS RIGHT TO
