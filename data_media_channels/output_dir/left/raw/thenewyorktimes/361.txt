[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,860
Been a very active
couple of months--

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,760
there's been probably four
major hurricanes in that time.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,450
There's been--

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,130


6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,980
--very, very severe
wildfire season in the West.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,380
Literally driving through
a fire at the moment.

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,620
Then on top of it,
we've had a couple

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,950
of very strong
earthquakes in Mexico.

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,390
Some of this is normal.

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,450
But some of it may also be a
harbinger of things to come.

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,748
Science can explain
all of these things.

13
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:31,240
[SCREAMING]

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,190
Earthquakes-- the
frequency of earthquakes

15
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,560
is remarkably
consistent year to year.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,410
A 7.0, roughly,
earthquake and then--

17
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,970
and also an 8.0 earthquake
within two weeks of each other

18
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,980
is not unusual at all.

19
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,430
The fact that they both happened
in Mexico is a little unusual.

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,465
But lots of quakes
happen in Mexico.

21
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:54,160


22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,990
Thing about earthquakes
is that most

23
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,330
of the big earthquakes,
actually, in the world

24
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,830
happen in places where
there's not a lot of people.

25
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,860
So they don't
really get noticed.

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,662
Earthquakes aside, it's tricky.

27
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:07,120
Some of what's been happening
is related to climate change.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,354
Some of it isn't.

29
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:11,020
So wildfires are an
interesting question

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,280
because there's some element of
normality and nature involved.

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,610
But there's a lot of
human influence here.

32
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,000
It's been very dry,
climate change-related.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,970
And also, there's certain
insect infestations

34
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,340
that are now worse because
of climate change that

35
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,370
can kill trees.

36
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,010
And that's fuel for fires.

37
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,770
Couple that with
human influences.

38
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,200
More and more people
are living in areas

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,650
that are close to forest.

40
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,850
The human desire to live
close to nature sort of plays

41
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,210
into the whole "what's
going on here" feeling,

42
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,180
whereas 20 years
ago, a wildfire might

43
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,210
have happened somewhere in the
Rockies and nobody lived there.

44
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,100
So nobody would really care.

45
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,040
Now the same wildfire might
happen in the same location.

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,640
And there's vacation
homes there.

47
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,050
And so people take notice.

48
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,566
Terms of hurricanes,
generally speaking,

49
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:09,399
the months of August,
September, and October

50
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,069
are the busy, active
part of the season.

51
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,110
Some years, you don't get
many hurricanes at all.

52
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,240
It's a naturally
variable situation.

53
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,870
It is probably a little
unusual that several of them

54
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,030
have been really
monster hurricanes,

55
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,820
and also have made landfall.

56
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,175
You want a big database
of things to study.

57
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:31,090
And with hurricanes, with, like,
12 or 15 storms every year,

58
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,180
that's not a huge number
that you're working with.

59
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,510
But some scientists say the
intense season we've had

60
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,810
is more likely to repeat
itself in years ahead.

61
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,720
Scientists are pretty
confident that climate change

62
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,790
will make hurricanes
worse for two reasons.

63
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,990
One is warmer air
holds more moisture.

64
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,930
The other impact is that
sea levels are rising.

65
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,740


66
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,800
Some point, particularly
if you're personally

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,420
affected by these things--

68
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,150
the scientific
explanation is not enough.

69
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,330
Whether you blame nature
or some higher being,

70
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,530
to be in awe and a little
scared or a lot scared

71
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,620
at what can happen to you in
these events is a good thing.

72
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,030
It probably means you
prepare for them better.

73
00:03:17,030 --> 00:00:00,000
