1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,560
Ezra Klein: Secretary Clinton, thank you for being
here.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,560
Hillary Rodham Clinton: Thank you, Ezra, glad to talk to you again.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,190
EK: So I wanted to start with a part of the
book that surprised me the most, which was

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,990
you almost ran on the beginning of a universal
basic income in America, which you were gonna

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,380
call Alaska for America.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,810
Tell me a bit about that idea and why it didn’t
make it into the final campaign.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:30,310
HRC: Well I wanted very much to convey a commitment
to trying to figure out ways to raise incomes.

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:37,280
Most of the emphasis on the campaign was,
as you know, on jobs and some big projects

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,130
like, really, the infrastructure program that
I put forward.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,930
But I was also really interested in what else
we were gonna be needing to do.

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,150
And so I looked at a couple of different approaches
to what’s called UBI, universal basic income.

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,720
The experiments that had been tried elsewhere.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,080
And the Alaska for America idea was really
intriguing to me because in effect it was

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:10,610
to argue that our natural patrimony really
does belong to every American — to try to

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:18,680
break mindset that the extraction of resources
is a totally private sector effort.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,870
That we, as Americans, have a stake in it
for all the reasons that you can understand.

17
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,420
And the Alaska model where they write a check
to every single Alaskan every year based on

18
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,990
a formula about the oil and gas revenues was
really intriguing to me.

19
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:44,050
And we dug deep, we tried to explain it to
some people, and it just was hard for people

20
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,350
to grasp what we were talking about because
most Americans in the Lower 48, as we like

21
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,540
to say, didn’t have any idea about what
was going on in Alaska.

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,120
So I kept looking for an opportunity to put
it in but not to make it a centerpiece of

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
the campaign.

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,810
EK: What would’ve going into a program like
that?

25
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,400
When you talk about our natural patrimony,
what would have been the inputs to that income?

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,378
HRC: Well that was one of the challenges we
had — trying to figure out exactly, when

27
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:18,130
you look nationwide, are we talking about
fossil fuels, which then might perversely

28
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:26,480
encourage the continued extraction of fossil
fuels, which would be an outcome that we weren’t

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,410
necessarily thinking was in the best interest.

30
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:37,610
Other kinds of natural patrimony — whether
it’s minerals or anything else that you

31
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,660
could look at and say, “Extracting that,
making private profit off of that, is really

32
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,830
part of America’s legacy.”

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,810
There were lots of really interesting questions.

34
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,210
We debated it for a long time — the fossil
fuels, climate change issues was one of the

35
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,210
complications.

36
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,490
EK: So the reason I start with that is when
you talk about, in the book, you say at the

37
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,709
end, “You know, maybe I should’ve proposed
that and left the details to be worked out

38
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:03,709
later.”

39
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,970
And it seems to me that this is one of the
pieces of the campaign that you’ve been

40
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,970
left reevaluating.

41
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:14,650
You say that you now have more of an appreciation
for the power of big, galvanizing ideas.

42
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,150
Do you think that one of the lessons of watching
Bernie Sanders, of watching Donald Trump,

43
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,800
is that perhaps the correct role for policy
in a campaign is to inspire?

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,739
And that the place for technocratically sound,
more pragmatic policy is in the legislative

45
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:31,739
process?

46
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:40,900
HRC: Well, that certainly is a fair conclusion
to draw from the way I try to raise the question.

47
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,050
If I could, Ezra, because you’re a policy
person and I love that about you, let me talk

48
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,550
about this a little bit more, because this
was a struggle from the very beginning.

49
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,070
This wasn’t something that I only thought
about retroactively.

50
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:04,480
I felt that I was in the following posture:
I was running to succeed a two-term president

51
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,480
from my own party who I happen to believe
did a really good job on some very difficult

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,190
issues.

53
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,910
And whether it was saving the economy, saving
the auto industry, getting us on the path

54
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,639
to universal health coverage with the Affordable
Care Act, I knew how hard it was to actually

55
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,770
get to where we got.

56
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,870
And I worried that if I were to say, “Well,
let’s go all the way, you know, with this

57
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,360
and we’ll leave the details ‘til later,”
the natural question is, “Well, why didn’t

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,339
that happen before?”

59
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:39,479
And I knew that would be my burden to bear,
because I would have the responsibility having

60
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,490
been in the administration to be able to answer
that question.

61
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,199
Secondly, I don’t think I’m held to same
standard as anybody else.

62
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:57,259
I believed that if I were to say let’s do
a carbon tax, let’s do single-payer tomorrow,

63
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:03,979
let’s do whatever it is that might be viewed
as universal and inspiring, unlike either

64
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,150
my primary opponent or my general election
opponent, who were never pinned down — except

65
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:16,189
in one case in the primary with respect to
Sen. Sanders — I would’ve been hammered

66
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,189
all the time.

67
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,360
“Okay, how are you going to do that?

68
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
How are you going to pay for it?

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Where’s the money going to come from?”

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,370
If I had said we are going to leave it to
the legislative process over here, they’ll

71
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,710
figure it out, people would’ve said, “Well,
you’ve been around, you know how it works.

72
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,710
How are you going to do that?

73
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,469
You don’t have 60 votes.”

74
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:39,300
I think I would have been hit with a thousand
different legitimate questions, and I think

75
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,460
I would have felt an obligation to answer.

76
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:48,500
So finally, you know, I do think policy matters,
and I think where I came out really made sense

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,960
for the country, made sense for the Democratic
candidate.

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:01,370
But it was hard to compete with, you know,
just the big claims and the assertions that

79
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,819
I got from both sides.

80
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:08,759
And maybe I could’ve been — in fact, I’m
sure I could’ve been — somewhat more adept

81
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,919
at trying to maneuver through that, so that
I got the benefit of saying here’s what

82
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:13,919
we are going to do.

83
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,230
I thought saying, “Look, we are gonna get
to universal coverage ’cause that’s my

84
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,039
goal — we’re at 90 percent now.

85
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,270
I think getting from 90 to 100 is a lot easier
than starting over” — I thought that made

86
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,449
sense to people.

87
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:30,270
I think in the end, a lot of people who were
going to vote for me believed that.

88
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,009
But, you know, that’s what you do when you
take a retrospective, like what could I have

89
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,009
done differently?

90
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,520
EK: So as someone that would have been asking
those agenda questions —

91
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,330
HRC: You would’ve been pinning me down,
and it would have been quite hard!

92
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,999
EK: And here is my question on that, though:
Do you think that those questions matter because

93
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,240
people would care about them?

94
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,300
Or because you would care about them?

95
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,939
Something that I have observed watching Trump
and other politicians in this era is that

96
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:01,360
a lot of what we thought can hurt a politician
is actually a relationship between them and

97
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
the press.

98
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,319
It’s their own shame, their own sense that
they’ve been pinned down, their own desire

99
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,679
to actually respond to what they feel is a
fair critique.

100
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,999
If you just don’t have that desire, if you
don’t care about that particular kind of

101
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,069
critique, it appears to lose at least some
of its power.

102
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,770
HRC: Ezra, you are 100 percent right.

103
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,770
EK: Thank you.

104
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,779
HRC: I feel like we are having a therapy session
in front of this camera.

105
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:25,889
You are 100 percent right, and I can’t change
who I am.

106
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:26,909
I knew that.

107
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:33,389
I knew that I am not someone who will say
things that aren’t true, that will not take

108
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,389
responsibility.

109
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:35,659
I had to run as me.

110
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:39,110
I love when people say, “Oh, if only we
knew her more, or she were more authentic.”

111
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,559
I’ve been around a long time.

112
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,559
I am what I am.

113
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:49,099
I care about being absolutely as accurate
as possible so people know how to judge what

114
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,689
I’m saying.

115
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:58,740
But I think this was not just a slight shift;
this was a ground-shaking shift.

116
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,669
Because I’m someone who’s observed presidential
elections a very long time, and I always saw

117
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,129
there would be a moment, maybe one or two,
where in a debate or in a really important

118
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,089
interview the candidate was asked, “How
are you going to do that?

119
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,590
Explain to me how that would work.”

120
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,180
That was certainly my experience in ’08.

121
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,379
I saw my husband go through it — in fact,
it probably saved his campaign.

122
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:25,089
I saw, you know, President Obama go through
it and be able to say both in ’08 and ’12,

123
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,419
look, here’s what we are going to do, and
I think this is realistic and we are going

124
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:29,639
to get it done.

125
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,139
But it’s going to make a difference.

126
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:37,330
He went from the specific to the upstretched
hands of the aspirational promise.

127
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,919
Yet it had to be connected to something that
was real.

128
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,709
And, you know, I’ve been around a long time.

129
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,440
I know how hard this is.

130
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,700
And I didn’t want to be either not telling
the truth about what was going to happen and

131
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,950
not being responsible about what I thought
we could do and get done together, which I

132
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,600
thought could be a pretty big deal.

133
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:09,830
But clearly in a reality TV campaign like
the one we were seeing in 2016, it was not

134
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,830
the same at all.

135
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,780
I never had those moments that I thought would
come.

136
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,140
EK: So you talk about you are what you are.

137
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,320
HRC: I am what I am.

138
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,510
EK: You are what you are.

139
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,430
And one of the things that was interesting
to me in the book was actually how you frame

140
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,330
your own history in political organizing.

141
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:32,430
So I’ve read your speech from Wellesley,
and it had always sounded like the words of

142
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,220
a radical to me.

143
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,500
But when you explain about how you thought
about running for student body president,

144
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,130
you said that “I ran for student government
president in 1968 because I thought I could

145
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:47,050
do a good job convincing college administrators
to make changes students wanted.”

146
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,800
You talk about your work with the Children’s
Defense Fund and focus on field work and making

147
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,060
reports.

148
00:09:53,060 --> 00:10:00,560
This is all in a period when a lot of people
around you were interested in upending systems.

149
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,560
How did you become more of a pragmatist who
wanted to work within the systems in a radical

150
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
era?

151
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,250
HRC: Well, there are always people who want
to upend system.

152
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:21,240
And I respect the desire for being part of
big change; I think that’s important particularly

153
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,870
when younger when you want to see that happen.

154
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:35,100
But I also became convinced early on that
in my understanding of change, it was rare

155
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,200
that in America you got those huge moments
of opportunity.

156
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,990
We saw it with President Johnson, with voting
rights, civil rights, Medicare, Medicaid,

157
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:52,350
with enormous Democratic majorities in the
House and the Senate, so a governing party

158
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:58,670
could actually implement what it chose to
pursue.

159
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,450
But that’s not that common in American political
history.

160
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:10,950
And as I watched what the hard, slow boring
of hard boards that Weber talks about meant

161
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:17,120
in our country — it was really digging in,
getting to know what you’re talking about,

162
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,370
making the case.

163
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,410
And sometimes you still ran into an immovable
political obstacle, but then you regrouped

164
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,010
and you went on again, which is what I did
with health care in the 1990s when we ended

165
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,270
up with the Children’s Health Insurance
Program.

166
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:38,470
So I’m really interested in change, I’m
really interested in the principles and the

167
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,220
values that I believe America stands for,
but I also know what it takes to get where

168
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,500
we need to go politically.

169
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,160
And that’s what I decided was the most effective
way to achieve what I was looking for.

170
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,160
EK: This feels to me like the argument that
has been at the center of both your ’08

171
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,500
and ’16 candidacies and that you have had
trouble making.

172
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,890
In both of those elections — in the primary
of ’08 and then both in the primary and

173
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,540
the general of this year, last year — you
ran against people who in some way or another

174
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,570
were saying they were going to upend whole
system.

175
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,200
They were going to bring hope and change,
they were going to bring a political revolution,

176
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,630
they were going to drain the swamp, whatever
it might have been.

177
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:24,120
In those cases you’ve always taken the stance
that you actually need to understand the system,

178
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,490
you need to work within it, the angels are
not going to come down with their violins.

179
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:36,320
And that has been I think simultaneously a
realistic and very hard-to-sell message.

180
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,570
I had a piece that I had written for if you
had won, and it was called “Hillary Clinton’s

181
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,010
Political Realism,” and it was about the
ways in which your vision of success was much

182
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,170
less about upending America’s political
system and much more about the change you

183
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,690
can bring within it.

184
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,290
Why is that such a hard message to sell to
the American people?

185
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,390
HRC: I don’t think it used to be quite as
hard.

186
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:06,290
I think it could be made harder because of
the environment in which we find ourselves

187
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:13,470
right now — but you see, I think I’m also
very realistic about the forces arrayed against

188
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,220
the kind of change I want to see.

189
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:22,410
There’s a big move for change coming from
the right that I think would be disastrous

190
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,900
for our country.

191
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,800
They want radical, pull-em-up-by-the-roots
change, they want to have a constitutional

192
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,240
convention to rewrite our Constitution to
make it friendlier to business, to inject

193
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,020
religious and ideological elements.

194
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,380
So talk about radical change — they are
pursuing it, they are funding it, and they

195
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:50,910
are electing people who are either true believers
or willing vehicles for it.

196
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,590
So what do we do on the other side?

197
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,150
Because we don’t control media the same
way the right does; it’s harder for our

198
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,720
message to get out.

199
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,980
So it’s okay to say all right, let’s really
work for change, but you’re going to have

200
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:15,800
to build an edifice under that that has the
kind of hard-fought political realities that

201
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,610
are going to be necessary to stand against
the right.

202
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,070
I thought and obviously came close — won
the popular vote and all of that — but I

203
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:32,840
thought at end of day, people would say, look,
we do want change, and we want the right kind

204
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,880
of change, and we want change that is realistic
and is going to make difference in my life

205
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
and my family’s life and my paycheck.

206
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,170
That’s what I was offering.

207
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:52,370
And I didn’t in any way want to feed into
this not just radical political argument that

208
00:14:52,370 --> 00:15:02,940
was being made on other side but a very negative
cultural argument about who we are as Americans.

209
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,670
So there was so much happening in this campaign
and a lot of it for the first time — some

210
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:16,420
of it as a result of long trends — that
I was running just trying to figure out, okay,

211
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,320
people are really that anti-immigrant?

212
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:27,230
Are they really, or is that just a convenient
excuse to rally a base?

213
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,670
How far does that really go?

214
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,279
It was a tough terrain that we were moving
through and trying to understand.

215
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,350
EK: This is something I think about in my
own writing.

216
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:44,210
Is it possible to be too realistic about the
forces arrayed against change, about the institutional

217
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,970
constraints against change in the American
political system — so realistic that you

218
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,970
miss openings, so realistic that it’s hard
to inspire people?

219
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,930
And as such, it actually begins driving the
outcomes themselves.

220
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,500
I feel like this is the critique of this kind
of politics.

221
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,010
HRC: I think it’s a fair critique.

222
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,980
I understand that critique.

223
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,340
But I don’t think the press did their job
in this election, with very few exceptions.

224
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:20,070
So the hard questions about what was real,
what was realistic, and what could happen

225
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,170
with the right kind of election outcome were
never really joined.

226
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:32,770
And so I found it frustrating obviously because
I think I could’ve defended and lifted up

227
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,120
a lot of what I believed we could do.

228
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:43,500
But really, Ezra, when you get 32 minutes
in a whole year to cover all policy, how does

229
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,000
that work?

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,020
Compare it even with ’08, when you had 200
minutes on broadcast TV — you think, well,

231
00:16:53,020 --> 00:17:01,460
is it that people are really not interested,
or is it that it’s just not as enticing

232
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:07,000
to the press because the other guy’s running
a reality TV show, which is hard to turn away

233
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,510
from.

234
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,699
And whatever we says we think is kind of goofy,
but hey, it’s good TV, and she’s over

235
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,730
there saying here’s how we’re going to
raise taxes on wealthy and here’s what we’re

236
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,030
going to do to close loopholes and here’s
where I think I can do it, and you know what,

237
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,618
she’s going to win anyway.

238
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:26,148
So let’s cover other guy ’cause he’s
a lot more fun.

239
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:33,730
And I think, in addition to everything you
say, which is fair and needs to be considered,

240
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,559
it was such a difficult environment even to
have that conversation, so who could tell

241
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,629
what was or was not realistic?

242
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:44,529
It was kind of all bets were off in the coverage
of the campaign.

243
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,840
EK: So Democrats are going to face a question
like this as we speak.

244
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,779
So right now in Washington, we’re interviewing
Sanders — another one of my reporters is

245
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,100
— who is proposing his single-payer bill
this week.

246
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,879
And a lot of Senate Democrats are expected
to sign on to the bill.

247
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:07,659
This bill would be quite sweeping; it would
upend every insurance arrangement, every private

248
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:09,740
insurance arrangement, in America.

249
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,789
Do you think that the Democratic party should
sign on, even aspirationally, to a bill that

250
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:18,559
is that radical in its vision?

251
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,559
HRC: Well, I don’t know what the particulars
are.

252
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,059
As you might remember, during the campaign
he introduced a single-payer bill every year

253
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:30,730
he was in Congress — and when somebody finally
read it, he couldn’t explain it and couldn’t

254
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,749
really tell people how much it was gonna cost.

255
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:39,750
So I haven’t seen whatever it is they’re
gonna be introducing and signing on to, so

256
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,289
I don’t know.

257
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:49,379
I’m for universal health care coverage that
is high-quality and affordable for every American.

258
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:55,299
And I think there’s a lot of ways of getting
there that I’ve advocated for, to open up

259
00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:01,059
Medicare, to open up Medicaid, to do more
on prescription drug costs, to really make

260
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:09,090
sure we get costs down and we do everything
we can to sort of break the stranglehold that

261
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:15,690
a lot of the pharmaceutical companies, which
are unfortunately still driving prices, have

262
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,769
on health care costs.

263
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:25,779
And I think it’s going to be challenging
if within that bill, there are tax increases

264
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:31,389
equivalent to what it would take to pay for
single-payer, and if you’re really telling

265
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:38,029
people — about half of the country — that
they can no longer have the policies they

266
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,200
have through employer.

267
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,629
I’ve been down this road!

268
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:43,769
This is not the first time we’ve tried to
confront this.

269
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:50,080
When I was working on health care back in
in ’93 and ’94, if we could’ve waved

270
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,440
the magic wand and started all over, I said
it numerous times, maybe we would start with

271
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,620
something resembling single-payer plus other
payers, like other countries that have universal

272
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:10,529
coverage and are much better at controlling
costs than we do, primarily in Europe.

273
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:18,590
But we were facing the reality — talk about
reality — of not just strong, powerful forces

274
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:29,010
but people’s own fears as well as their
appreciation for what they already had.

275
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:36,440
So when the bill is actually introduced, I’ll
read it, I’ll look at it, but if it doesn’t

276
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:44,360
have some kind of grandfathering in, if it
doesn’t have some kind of cost estimate

277
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,179
— because look at what happened in Vermont.

278
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,769
It wasn’t for lack of trying in Vermont.

279
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:54,789
The Democratic political establishment was
behind single-payer, and they worked for years

280
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:55,789
to achieve it.

281
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:02,080
This is in, you know, a small state, where
it might’ve been possible.

282
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,039
They were talking about an increase in the
payroll tax of 9.5 percent, or I think, no,

283
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,039
maybe 11.5 percent, they were talking about
a sliding income scale, they went up to 9.5

284
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,720
percent — it just was so difficult to put
pieces together.

285
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:24,690
Now, clearly if you had a national plan, that
would be more likely to avoid state-by-state

286
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:30,049
comparisons, but I think it’s gonna be a
big challenge.

287
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:34,570
Our goal should be universal health care coverage
— universal, affordable, quality health

288
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,940
care coverage for everybody, bar none.

289
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,710
EK: Let me ask you about the other side, about
Obamacare — which seems, for the moment,

290
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:47,269
to have withstood the attacks on it — but
that was a policy that was really built with

291
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:48,269
an eye toward realism.

292
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:52,370
An eye toward what could pass, but also an
eye toward how could you overlay something

293
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,179
on the existing system that wouldn’t disrupt
too many of the existing arrangements.

294
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:02,590
And those pieces of the plan — the exchanges,
the private insurers — have been the most

295
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,630
substantively difficult to implement and to
defend, and then also the most politically

296
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,630
difficult.

297
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,870
It’s left the administration, first Obama
and now Trump, at the mercy of private insurers

298
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,049
deciding whether or not to sell, with premium
increases they can’t defend, and what has

299
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,940
really ended up being popular in that and
defensible in that is the Medicaid expansion.

300
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:28,169
Is that a place where Democrats overread what
realism required and ended up in a position

301
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:34,799
where what they had wasn’t that inspiring
and wasn’t, in the end, that easy to either

302
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,040
implement or sustain?

303
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:44,980
I think you have to unpack what you just asked,
because even embedded in it was your reference

304
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,710
to Medicaid.

305
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,410
It was really unfortunate that because of
the drafting of the bill, it gave the Supreme

306
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:58,360
Court the opening to eliminate the Medicaid
requirement, the expansion requirement.

307
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:04,929
But what has happened is that Medicaid has
become very popular even in Republican states

308
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:11,019
because it does save money and it is a universal
program below a certain income level, and

309
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:16,590
it takes care of middle-income people when
it comes to nursing homes and disabilities

310
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,700
and all the rest.

311
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:26,100
So I think we should be focused politically,
realistically, and aspirationally on expanding,

312
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,370
continuing the expansion of Medicaid, and
going to those states that have not yet expanded

313
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,370
it.

314
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,820
And making the political case every day for
as long as it takes.

315
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:44,580
I was in favor of a Medicare buy-in; if you
start slowly moving the age down, it would

316
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,360
make a very big difference.

317
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,509
People’s health begins to have more problems
after 55, so let’s get Medicaid down to

318
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:53,019
60 and then maybe down to 55.

319
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:58,630
I am in favor of a public option, and the
Democrats thought they were going to get a

320
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:05,009
public option and at the very end didn’t
have votes for reasons that I think were inexcusable

321
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,009
at the time.

322
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:08,340
But that was just the fact.

323
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,919
You know, you gotta pass it.

324
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,609
So is that realism or aspiration?

325
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,629
Well, at the end of the day it’s votes.

326
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:16,789
And it didn’t pass.

327
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:25,549
So there are pieces that became less popular
partly because of a really well-funded, nonstop

328
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,320
campaign against it.

329
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,929
But then all of a sudden, with all this talk
about repeal and replace — which was just

330
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,049
nonsense; they never had a plan to replace,
it was just a political talking point, and

331
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:41,529
I don’t think Democrats did a good enough
job defending it against those attacks — so

332
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:47,989
when it came time to take something away that
people had gotten used to, everybody said

333
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:48,989
no.

334
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:52,039
And that’s my larger point about what our
goal really is.

335
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,580
You’re going to tell 50 percent of America,
“You are no longer to have your employer-based

336
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,789
health care, but oh, trust us, it’s going
to be really good when we finally work out

337
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:05,519
all the kinks” -- you’re going to have
massive resistance by people, who are gonna

338
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,750
say, “I’m happy with what I’ve got.”

339
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,790
But if you say, “You know what, we need
to lower age for Medicare, and here’s how

340
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,299
we can do that, and we need to continue the
expansion of Medicaid,” we will be at universal

341
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:18,690
coverage.

342
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,559
Then once we’re at universal coverage, and
people know what that feels like, then can

343
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,730
begin to say, “Okay, here’s what we’re
going to do to make it work better, to get

344
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,730
the costs down.”

345
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,529
I think that’s — you know, I think that’s
not just realistic, I think it’s thrilling.

346
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:37,509
You know, as somebody who was one of the main
advocates for the Children’s Health Insurance

347
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:41,360
Program, I see the difference it’s made
in people’s lives.

348
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,759
And all through the campaign, people would
come up to me and say, “I was on that program,”

349
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,269
or, “My family wouldn’t have been able
to afford my sister’s care if it hadn’t

350
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,039
been for that” — I find that exhilarating
because that, to me, is what public service

351
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,840
is supposed to be about.

352
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,470
The Children’s Health Insurance Program
is set to expire at end of this month — what

353
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,559
are the forces going to be that will say no,
you’re not going to take this away from

354
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,230
8, 9 million kids, where are they gonna go?

355
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:14,269
So what I think is really motivating about
being in politics in public service is you

356
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:19,549
can actually see the positive changes, whether
it’s civil rights or economics or health

357
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:24,690
care or whatever it might be — and I think
at the end of the day, that’s more important

358
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,249
than, you know, how realistic was it or aspirational
was it.

359
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:34,610
EK: So one of the pieces of the book that
really outlined, I think, the disagreement

360
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,090
between you and some of the public is right
around here.

361
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,769
So we’re talking here about the practice
of politics, what is realistic, what isn’t,

362
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:47,610
but there’s a real feeling among a lot of
folks that the long-term practice of mainstream

363
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,519
politics is itself a corrupting exercise.

364
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,619
And I think back to 2008, I was at [something]
when you were there for a debate with the

365
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:59,789
other Democratic candidates, and there was
this really interesting exchange about lobbyists.

366
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:03,940
And you defended them as part of the political
system: They have a role to play.

367
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,200
The represent people you don’t like but
also people you do like.

368
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,269
There’s a version of that in your defense
of the speeches, in which you sort of say,

369
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:15,559
looked bad, shouldn’t have done it, but
you see it as somewhat ridiculous — the

370
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:20,100
idea that Goldman Sachs paying you could have
changed what you think.

371
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,609
This to me feels like an actually pretty central
fault line in our politics now, the feeling

372
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,909
that a lot of the public has that if you’ve
been in politics a long time, in mainstream

373
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:34,649
politics, that you’ve probably gone a little
bit bad from it.

374
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:39,450
And Barack Obama coming in as an outsider
in 08, Donald Trump as an outsider, Bernie

375
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,419
Sanders, who had held back from a lot of the
political system during his career in Washington

376
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,659
— that seemed to be a place where there
was a lot of friction.

377
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:50,149
How do you think about politics versus this
anti-politics sentiment?

378
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:55,239
HRC: Look, anti-politics is part of the American
DNA — it goes back to the very beginning.

379
00:27:55,239 --> 00:28:04,820
I have no doubt that it’s just built into
America’s skepticism and disdain for the

380
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
people in politics.

381
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,919
So that’s just part of the background of
being in politics.

382
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:18,019
But I think it’s important to again try
to recognize what’s real and what’s not.

383
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:21,380
You know, I can’t help it; I’m like the
Velveteen Rabbit.

384
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,010
I believe in reality.

385
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,019
I like living in a reality-based world.

386
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:31,279
I don’t like alternative facts, I don’t
like the very concerted, well-funded effort

387
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,169
to try to distort news.

388
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,169
I don’t like any of that.

389
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:42,559
I think a democracy like ours depends upon
trying to have a vigorous, fact-based debate.

390
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,279
So: Nobody on the Republican side cares about
any of these issues, Ezra; you know that.

391
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,399
I voted for McCain-Feingold; I said in my
campaign one of the first things I would do

392
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,509
is introduce a constitutional amendment to
repeal Citizens United.

393
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:07,390
So I take a back seat to nobody in standing
up for sensible, hard-hitting campaign finance

394
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,390
rules.

395
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,029
But everybody’s got politics.

396
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:15,230
You know, I go after Bernie really hard on
the NRA — that’s politics for him.

397
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,429
And the idea that he’s set off from politics
— he’s been in politics his whole adult

398
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:20,429
life.

399
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:26,419
Donald Trump wasn’t in politics, but he
was somebody who funded people on both sides

400
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:28,559
to in order to curry favors.

401
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,710
Until we get to public financing, which I
wholeheartedly endorse, and we have this crazy

402
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,220
system where you have to go out and raise
the money — we don’t have a party structure

403
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:44,350
that funds campaigns, we don’t have public
financing — then if Democrats unilaterally

404
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,940
disarm and say, “You know, we’re holier
than Caesar’s wife, and we won’t say or

405
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,649
do anything that might raise a question”
— there is no compunction on the other side.

406
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:59,320
And there is such an imbalance right now in
our politics, in the amount of money that’s

407
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,320
on the other side — the Koch brothers say
they’re gonna spend $400 million in the

408
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,549
2018 campaign — so yeah, I think, you know,
people have to be willing to say, okay, I

409
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:16,640
understand how this might look, it’s not
really how I felt or how I acted, but okay,

410
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,499
I understand that, so let’s agree on that.

411
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:28,529
But at the end of day, it is very much an
unbalanced political environment right now

412
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:37,090
between the resources that are behind Republicans
and their campaigns — because it’s not

413
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:43,450
just a straight line between who gave you
money, it’s all the rest of the operation

414
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,639
— and what stands behind Democrats.

415
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:50,399
And you know if we don’t care about that,
then fine, but I don’t think that’s gonna

416
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,590
come out very well for us.

417
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,769
EK: But in terms of demonstrating that kind
of purity, isn’t there a dimension here

418
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:02,620
where Republicans who do not have a very high
opinion of the government do not mind particularly

419
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,850
the feeling that the government is corrupt,
that it does not work on their behalf, that

420
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,440
it might even work on behalf of special interests
— that that is not actually a threat to

421
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,019
their particular version of politics?

422
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:15,340
Whereas for Democrats, who do want people
to trust the government, who do want people

423
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,759
to have faith in public institutions, there
is a higher bar.

424
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,710
HRC: Yeah, and I think Democrats by and large
try to reach it.

425
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,489
I mean, Barack Obama took more money from
Wall Street in 08 than any other Democrat

426
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:32,129
has ever taken, and turned around and imposed
the toughest regulations under Dodd-Frank

427
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:34,659
since the Great Depression.

428
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:39,809
I tell people that all the time — if you
give me money, you will know, because I will

429
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:43,470
tell you publicly and privately what I’m
for.

430
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,730
So if you’re in a high income tax bracket,
I wanna tax you.

431
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,309
If you still want to give me money, you are
going in with your eyes open.

432
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:57,109
I think it’s theoretically an interesting
conversation, but you look at somebody like

433
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:04,139
President Obama, who inherited this disastrous
economy and, you know, I think did an incredible

434
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:10,110
job pulling it back out of the abyss — took
a lot of money from a lot of different interests,

435
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,919
but it didn’t affect how he governed.

436
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,599
And so let’s get to the second level here.

437
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:20,269
EK: I do think that’s strong, though, that
it didn’t affect how he governed.

438
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,269
HRC: Right.

439
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:25,440
EK: I think a lot of President Obama’s policies
were pretty sound, but also a lot of people

440
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,149
feel he could’ve done more to punish bankers,
that he could’ve gone further on health

441
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:33,889
care, there were deals cut before the fact
with the pharmaceutical industry, with the

442
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:35,460
insurance industry.

443
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,099
And there are other political realism considerations
in all these questions, but one thing here

444
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:44,009
is that it’s true, I think, directionally
what you’re saying, that a lot of these

445
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,359
cut against the interests who funded him.

446
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:50,090
But what a lot of people feel and what I think
there is evidence for is that these kinds

447
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,799
of donations, etc., they do give people more
of a voice, they do give these interests more

448
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,919
of a voice, and that does affect things certainly
on the margins, certainly in the details.

449
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,950
HRC: Well, but, you know, it’s always been
thus.

450
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:06,039
I mean, if you’ve seen the musical Hamilton,
you know, if you’re running a raucous —

451
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,519
EK: — I actually haven’t gotten tickets
to that.

452
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,450
HRC: — well, we’ll see if we can help
you on that.

453
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:16,440
If you’re running a raucous, pluralistic,
diverse democracy where there are literally

454
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,129
millions of different voices, you are going
to hear from all kind of voices.

455
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:26,760
I was a senator for eight years -- I bet the
vast majority of people who came through the

456
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,960
doors of my Senate office to talk to me, to
advocate, whatever they were doing, were not

457
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,200
political donors or certainly not political
donors to me.

458
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,929
They were constituents, they were citizens,
they had something to say.

459
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:47,549
So part of what -- we’ve shrunk the political
process to such a narrow set of questions,

460
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:50,960
and that’s in the interests of both the
far right and the far left, both of whom want

461
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,059
to blow up system and undermine it and all
the rest of the stuff they talk about.

462
00:33:56,059 --> 00:34:00,690
I think we operate better when we’re kind
of between center right and center left, because

463
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:06,509
that’s where at least up until recently,
maybe it’s changed now -- until recently,

464
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:08,599
that’s where most American were.

465
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,780
Look, they didn’t get up every day obsessed
with what the government and politics was

466
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,710
going to do -- they wanted to know what were
the results and is it going to make a difference

467
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,710
to my life.

468
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:25,560
And I thought we had a pretty good balance,
but I again will argue that this has gone

469
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
on for decades.

470
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:36,980
The right has been on a mission to disrupt
and overturn the political system to the benefit

471
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,810
of their commercial, ideological, and partisan
interests.

472
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,760
I don’t see how you can argue with that.

473
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,360
And it has been pretty effective, all said.

474
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:56,530
Their gerrymandering, their suppression of
votes — they have a clear agenda, and it’s

475
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:03,120
fascinating that Trump wasn’t really particularly
interested in any of this but he was, it turned

476
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,720
out to be, a great vehicle for them to promote
these interests.

477
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,690
So we’re watching the internal debate within
their party play out.

478
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,300
On our side, you know, I just disagree.

479
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,360
I was in that Senate for eight years, I know
how hard it is to get to 60 votes.

480
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,341
Now, you can say we shouldn’t have to get
to 60 votes, but the fact is whether you’re

481
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:27,690
in the majority of in the minority, and I’ve
been in both, that has been the rule: Get

482
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,130
to 60 votes.

483
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:35,320
Because that then demonstrates at least a
broader cross section of representative Americans

484
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,210
being in favor of something.

485
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:43,060
So when you talk about bankers, if you look
at the laws we had at the time, maybe more

486
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,900
could’ve been done, but I’ve heard very
credible, very tough people say not really

487
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,640
because of the burden of proof and the evidence.

488
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,360
I’m not defending it; I’m just saying
it’s not for lack of trying that a lot of

489
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,980
things were not undertaken.

490
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:03,880
There were barriers to trying that had to
be knocked down and changed.

491
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,930
And the same with Dodd-Frank.

492
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:10,050
I mean, if Dodd-Frank had been in effect before
the crash, more could have been done, but

493
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,050
it wasn’t.

494
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,050
It had to come after.

495
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,150
EK: So I want to talk and move us a little
bit to the 2016 election and what happened.

496
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,150
HRC: What Happened.

497
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,150
EK: The subject of the book.

498
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,150
HRC: My book, yes.

499
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,193
EK: There’s a premise that is not really
articulated one way or the other in the book,

500
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:25,860
and I wanted to see where you fell on it.

501
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:31,960
Was Donald Trump more or less a normal Republican
candidate who 1) should have expected to begin

502
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,000
with 40-42 percent of the vote?

503
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,340
And so you’re just explaining how did a
Republican candidate win the election?

504
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,980
Or is Donald Trump an abnormal candidate who
you should have expected to begin with 30-35

505
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,660
percent of the vote, and so you have to have
this very large, explanatory lead as to how

506
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,490
he came close enough to actually win?

507
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,090
What are you explaining?

508
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:57,650
HRC: I think given the hyperpartisanship in
the country right now, once he became the

509
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:05,460
Republican nominee, the odds were very high
that Republicans would come home to him as

510
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,880
their nominee.

511
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,610
Because regardless of what he said or how
he behaved or what came out about him, he

512
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:17,920
was their path to tax cuts, he was their path
to a Supreme Court seat.

513
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,120
There is an agenda on the other side that
really does motivate the right.

514
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,550
So at the end of the day, I think something
like 90 percent of Republicans voted for him

515
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,000
and 90 percent of Democrats voted for me.

516
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,990
That’s unfortunate in lots of ways — I
wish we weren’t in such a hyperpartisan

517
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,090
political era — but that’s what I always
expected.

518
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,980
I always thought the election would be close.

519
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,350
I never was one of those people who said,
oh, my gosh, he’s so unacceptable and this,

520
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,350
that.

521
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,910
I always thought it would be close.

522
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:55,640
I didn’t expect to be totally ambushed at
the end, which is what I believe, and obviously

523
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,060
have written about it, cost me the election
— but I always thought it would be close.

524
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:08,490
It’s not like there was going to be some
wholehearted rejection of Trump by Republicans

525
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,390
who frankly thought they could handle him.

526
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,300
They thought, you know what, it’ll be an
entertaining four years, and you know, Mike

527
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,840
Pence and Mitch McConnell will take care of
everything for us.

528
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,751
I mean, that was the thinking that I believe
went into a lot of the Republicans’ — some

529
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:26,650
of whom sort of took a deep breath before
they did it — but they didn’t take him

530
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,740
seriously, they didn’t take a potential
presidency seriously.

531
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,180
They thought getting a Republican in there,
that’s going to deliver for these things

532
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
that I care about.

533
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,280
EK: But that’s a kind of remarkable view
of politics.

534
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,620
It’s actually one that I share, but it’s
still a remarkable one, to imagine that we

535
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:47,080
are now in a time, for reasons related to
polarization and other things we talked about,

536
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,840
that anybody — anybody — who wins a party
primary, and parties no longer have control

537
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:58,120
over their primaries — anybody who wins
a party primary begins within spitting distance

538
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,310
of winning the presidential election.

539
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,510
HRC: I believe that.

540
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:04,980
EK: Does that mean we’re more vulnerable
to demagogues, to authoritarians, to dangerous

541
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,840
candidates than we were in the past?

542
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,330
HRC: Yes, we are, Ezra.

543
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:13,610
I mean, if I’d lost to what I guess we could
call a normal Republican — one of the other

544
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,280
16 people on the stage during their primary
—

545
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,550
EK: Jim Gilmore.

546
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,750
HRC: Well, somebody that might have been able
to win.

547
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:26,040
Look, I would have been disappointed, I would
have been upset and heartbroken, but — first

548
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,890
of all, I don’t think it would’ve happened,
but secondly, if it had happened, I wouldn’t

549
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,610
feel such a sense of anxiety about the country.

550
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,650
EK: I’m sorry, can I stop you there?

551
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,650
HRC: Yeah.

552
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,760
EK: That was interesting, what you just said.

553
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,330
Do you think that Donald Trump was a stronger
candidate than the other Republicans?

554
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,330
HRC: Yes.

555
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,330
EK: You would have beat the others, but you
didn’t beat him?

556
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,320
HRC: Well, I don’t want to speculate like
that, but I think the fact he emerged, and

557
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:54,060
the way he emerged, which was so unlike anybody
ever getting a nomination in recent times,

558
00:39:54,060 --> 00:40:01,370
demonstrated the strength he had, which was
really rooted in a very cynical assessment

559
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,870
of how he could build a Republican majority.

560
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:13,500
He started on the very first day saying terrible
things about Mexican immigrants — you know,

561
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:21,750
that they’re rapists and criminals — and
all of a sudden, people in the Republican

562
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,510
side of the electorate began to say, “Oh,
somebody’s speaking to me.”

563
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,730
And then he went on from there.

564
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:35,600
And all of his dog whistles and all of his
appeals began to coalesce in the primary,

565
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:42,470
and then once he won the nomination, he had
some additional advantages like Russian help

566
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:50,030
and sophisticated data analytics operation,
weaponizing information, all of that.

567
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,550
But his core base — and he was right when
he said, “I could shoot somebody in the

568
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:59,760
middle of Fifth Avenue and my supporters won’t
leave me” — because he was, in a visceral

569
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,810
way, feeding into their prejudice and paranoia.

570
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,850
EK: So then that’s an argument — because
I want to make sure I try to understand you

571
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,680
here — that’s an argument that Donald
Trump was stronger than other Republican candidates

572
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,730
because he was willing to play white resentment
politics in a way that others weren’t.

573
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,090
Is that a fair reading of what you just said?

574
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,560
HRC: I think that’s part of his appeal,
yes.

575
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:23,100
And he was willing to play, let’s not forget,
Islamophobic politics, homophobic politics,

576
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:31,790
sexist politics — I mean, hit hit every
single area of resentment and grievance that

577
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,510
people were feeling.

578
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:42,370
And his racism, which was endemic to his campaign,
wasn’t subtle at all.

579
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:50,020
And there’s now been so much analysis done
since the election demonstrating clearly that

580
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:57,450
so-called cultural/racial anxiety and prejudice
was the primary driver for a lot of his support.

581
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:02,640
EK: But one way of reading the election results
is that Donald Trump, through these appeals,

582
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,030
was able to get white voters to act as an
interest group, to coalesce them in a way

583
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,640
they had not recently been coalesced, to motivate
them, particularly downscale whites, in a

584
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,730
way they had not recently been motivated.

585
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,200
That didn’t happen as much with women voters.

586
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,910
You talked about watching the Women’s Marches
after the election — where was this solidarity

587
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,910
during the campaign?

588
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,960
Where was this outrage during the campaign?

589
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,700
Why do you think that politics worked for
Trump but you didn’t see a corresponding

590
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,040
surge, particularly among female voters?

591
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,500
HRC: Well, let’s start with this fact, though:
I did carry the women’s vote.

592
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,790
EK: You did carry the women’s vote.

593
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,790
HRC: Right.

594
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,480
I lost the white women’s vote, but I actually
got more white women votes than Barack Obama

595
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
got.

596
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,370
So this was part of a trend.

597
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,540
EK; In 2008?

598
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,230
HRC: I can’t remember if it was ’08 or
’12.

599
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,230
Yeah.

600
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,800
And so white voters have been fleeing the
Democratic Party ever since Lyndon Johnson

601
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,900
predicted they would.

602
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,100
There is no surprise to that.

603
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:05,480
Of course I hoped I could get more than a
traditional Democratic nominee did because

604
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,850
I was the first woman with the chance to be
president — but gender is not the motivating

605
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:15,250
factor that race was for President Obama.

606
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,900
And so many women — and let’s talk about
white women, because that’s the group of

607
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:32,840
women that I lost — are really quite politically
dependent on their view of their own security

608
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,550
and their own position in society, what works
and doesn’t work for them.

609
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:41,340
So as I say in the book, I had this really
revealing conversation with Sheryl Sandberg

610
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,830
before the campaign.

611
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,710
And she’s immersed herself in every bit
of research about how do women think and what

612
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,260
do they expect.

613
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,750
And she said look — and we’re talking
predominantly about white women — okay,

614
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:00,120
she said the research is really clear: The
more professionally successful a man becomes,

615
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,540
the more likable he becomes.

616
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,580
The more professionally successful a woman
becomes, the less likable she becomes.

617
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:12,630
When a woman is advocating on behalf of others,
or working for someone and working hard for

618
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:18,190
that person, the way I did as secretary of
state when I was so popular in the public

619
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:23,530
opinion polls, that is favorably received
by people.

620
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:28,910
But when a woman advocates for herself — so
if I go and say to Vox, I think Ezra deserves

621
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,370
a raise, people say, Boy is she a good person.

622
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,790
I mean, she’s out there advocating for Ezra.

623
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:38,060
If I go and I say, you know, I think I’m
working really hard and I think I deserve

624
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,280
a raise, it’s like wow, what got into her?

625
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,750
What’s the deal?

626
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:49,060
So Sheryl ended describing all this to me
by saying remember, they will have no empathy

627
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,660
for you.

628
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:58,830
Now, I believe absent Comey, I might’ve
picked up 1 or 2 points among white women.

629
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,320
I’ll give you the example I used in the
book.

630
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,040
Before the Comey letter on October 28, I was
26 points ahead in the Philadelphia suburbs.

631
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,720
That could’ve only happened if I had a big
vote from women, Republican women, independent

632
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,580
women.

633
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,870
A week later, 11 days later, I win the Philadelphia
suburbs by 13 points.

634
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,570
I needed to win by 18 points to be able to
counterbalance the rest of the state.

635
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:28,270
That wasn’t just me; that’s how Democrats
win Pennsylvania in presidential campaigns.

636
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:33,820
It stopped my momentum, and it hurt me, particularly
among women.

637
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,080
And I have so much anecdotal evidence for
this, and now researchers are starting to

638
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,610
pull some of this together.

639
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,270
You know, all of a sudden the husband turns
to the wife: I told you, she’s going to

640
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,570
be in jail, you don’t wanna waste your vote.

641
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,430
You know, the boyfriend turns to the girlfriend
and says, She’s going to get locked up!

642
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,430
Don’t you hear?

643
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,900
She’s going to get locked up.

644
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:59,300
All of a sudden it becomes a very fraught
kind of conflictual experience.

645
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,780
And so instead of saying I’m taking a chance,
I’m going to vote, it didn’t work.

646
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:11,170
So I think that there is a lot of work still
to be done to try to appeal to as broad an

647
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:18,500
electorate as possible, but not by sacrificing
the constituents we have who have stuck with

648
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:26,340
us who are part of a majority if they aren’t
suppressed and if they can be motivated to

649
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,340
turn out.

650
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,780
And I hope that happens in 2018.

651
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,970
EK: The premise of a lot of these conversations
— you would imagine what we’re talking

652
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,070
about is persuasion.

653
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:39,690
You imagine we’re talking about how do a
candidate, you in this case, get the most

654
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:40,690
votes?

655
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,060
But in this case, you did.

656
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,110
And one broader question that you don’t
really take on in the book, but since the

657
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,630
turn of the millennium, 40 percent of the
presidential elections have seen the popular

658
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,100
vote won by Democrats and seen the result
overturned in the Electoral College.

659
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
HRC: That’s right.

660
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,260
Which is just crazy in these days.

661
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,490
EK: Do Democrats have a democracy problem?

662
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,840
HRC: No, we have an Electoral College problem.

663
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,390
EK: Should there be an Electoral College?

664
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,490
HRC: As far back as 2000, I’ve said no.

665
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:11,540
I think it’s an anachronism.

666
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:18,090
I won in counties that produce two-thirds
of the economic output in the United States;

667
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:23,940
I won in places that were more on the optimistic
side of the scale than the pessimistic side.

668
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,700
I won in places that understood and appreciated
diversity.

669
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,081
I won in places where African-American and
younger voters were not suppressed, as they

670
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:39,560
successfully were in, for example, Wisconsin
and other locations that I didn’t win.

671
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,260
So I think you have to take this and pick
it apart.

672
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:47,790
If you come with just one answer, it’s not
going to give you what you need to go forward.

673
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:54,581
But at the end of day, if you look at what
where we are right now, if we don’t convince

674
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:59,270
— and when I say “we,” it’s the great
big Democratic we, not me — but if we don’t

675
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:06,630
convince people to register to vote and vote,
the simplest exercise of your citizenship

676
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:13,960
in our country, in the 2018 election, then
I really do think we’re going to see the

677
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:20,870
clear and present danger to our democracy
that I’ve been talking about come to fruition.

678
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,680
We will see a constitutional convention.

679
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,740
Now, whether it ever finally gets ratified,
I’m not sure, but so it will be so divisive

680
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:37,090
and it will rile up so much of our population,
we will see the continuing efforts on the

681
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:43,950
right to disenfranchise people, to roll back
regulations that are good for our health and

682
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:47,480
our environment and so much else, we will
not recognize America.

683
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,310
So part of the reason I wrote this book was
not just to say okay, there’s a lot of theories

684
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:57,560
floating around, here’s what I think happened,
and I’ve got evidence behind what I say,

685
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:03,540
and I hope you’ll pay attention because
if we don’t, what happened to me will continue

686
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,660
to happen, and I don’t want to see that
in America.

687
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,840
EK: But one question about that is actually
where the geography of that is going.

688
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,080
You talked about winning more of the economic
output, probably more than any Democrat has

689
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,080
before —

690
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
HRC: Yeah, probably.

691
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,300
EK: But part of that is that Democrats are
clustering in urban centers, they’re clustering

692
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,000
in big states, and the American political
system is not built to advantage that; it’s

693
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,410
built to disadvantage that.

694
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:31,200
It seems to me that the Democratic Party could
be in a position where it’s winning a lot

695
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,350
of moral victories.

696
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,620
HRC: No, I’m not interested in that alone.

697
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,020
I mean, obviously if we don’t win elections,
we don’t win.

698
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,570
But there are pieces of this you can address,
Ezra.

699
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:47,130
Let’s start with voter suppression, which
is one of the five reasons why I believe I

700
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,130
lost.

701
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:54,520
Compare Wisconsin to Illinois or Wisconsin
to Minnesota — Wisconsin has had a concerted

702
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,900
voter suppression campaign going on under
Scott Walker and the Republicans.

703
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,380
The AP says maybe 200,000 people were turned
away.

704
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,580
Illinois has had none of that.

705
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,790
In fact, they’ve made it easier to vote.

706
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,290
Minnesota is an easier-to-vote state.

707
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,450
I won both of those.

708
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,790
You’ve had voter suppression in Michigan.

709
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,960
You’ve had voter suppression in Pennsylvania.

710
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,200
Now, that is not about me.

711
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,950
That is about what’s right and decent and
constitutional.

712
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:30,520
And I was shocked when the Supreme Court threw
out the guts of the Voting Rights Act.

713
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,680
I was in the Senate, I voted for it, we voted
98 to nothing, George W. Bush signed it, and

714
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,520
along comes the Republican majority on the
Supreme Court and they throw it out, and Republican

715
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,960
governors and legislators could not have been
more gleeful.

716
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,080
Now, that is not a big-ticket item.

717
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,190
That is hard work.

718
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:55,240
We need to elect legislators, we need to elect
secretaries of state, we need to bring court

719
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,340
cases, because if we don’t deal with this
voter suppression, yeah, the electorate will

720
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,340
continue to shrink.

721
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,850
And it won’t just be the Electoral College;
it will be within these states.

722
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:10,520
A shrinkage of the legitimacy of our constitutional
democracy.

723
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,660
So I care passionately about this because
this will determine what kind of country we

724
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,420
have for my grandchildren.

725
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:22,160
And so I’m going to be out there day in
and day out trying to do what I can to support

726
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:32,840
efforts to give back voting to people, whoever
they are, across our country, so that their

727
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,200
voices can be heard and we have a democracy
that really functions right.

728
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,900
EK: Hillary Clinton, thank you very much.

729
00:51:39,900 --> 00:00:00,000
HRC: Thank you.
