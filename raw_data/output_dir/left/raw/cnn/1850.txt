1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
first question is what every American
waking up wants to know how much danger

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,570
is the United States in right now well
we're still along that predictable arc

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,160
but I think most people have been
watching this problem expected I mean

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,529
the timing may have been a bit of a
surprise but the North I believe was

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,660
going to do this this is their plan this
is where they were going they're doing

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,859
it for their own purposes
I don't mean to criticize the current

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,159
administration I think some of the
things they've done to amp up the

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,140
pressure on the North Koreans have been
absolutely appropriate but you realize

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,540
the sum total after seven months of the
Trump administration is that North Korea

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,550
is much further along in its missile and
its nuclear program just the way it

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,420
performed when President Obama was
president and President Bush was

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,550
president there's a real consistency
here a scary consistency need and you

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,230
did tell my colleague Jake Tapper what
you just alluded to there that you

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,880
believe they said this on August 9th
that Trump has a coherent plan on North

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,159
Korea and it was in artfully executed a
lot has changed since then as you just

16
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,520
mentioned do you still believe the White
House has a reasonable plan to deal with

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,140
North Korea I I do know it's still an
artfully executed you got to watch the

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,540
tweets and I think we had an unforced
error over the weekend when we brought

19
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,090
up our free trade agreement with our
South Korean friends on whom we rely on

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,200
with them we will have to cooperate for
this problem just out of the blue the

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,850
president indicated he may want to
renegotiate that agreement I think

22
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,100
that's probably wrong on the merits and
it's certainly not integrated into a

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,189
broader approach to Northeast Asia so I
think that hurt so still an artfully

24
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,460
executed but again I think our policy is
to impress upon the Chinese how

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,540
seriously we view this North Korea's
been along this predictable arc the

26
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:08,098
unpredictable actor has been us we've
actually acted with more sound and fury

27
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,350
than I think the Chinese are accustomed
to I think we've done that with purpose

28
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,080
in essence to discomfort the Chinese
with the current situation exactly and

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,500
you know in all fairness and I think
this is what you're pointing out with

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,270
the part of the Trump policy on North
Korea that you like that everything that

31
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,110
has been tried for the past two decades
has not worked so why not

32
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,670
you know rattle the cages particularly
of the Chinese but it hasn't worked not

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,180
not so far and it's not cost-free then I
mean 18 24 months ago I pointed out that

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,500
we'd probably be where we are now on
this arc with the North Koreans getting

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,870
more capable and more dangerous we would
be there almost certainly within our

36
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,580
current definition of acceptable risk
and clearly what the Trump

37
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,680
administration has decided to do was to
embrace a bit more risk to be a bit more

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,720
activist be a bit more destabilizing of
the piece of the stability of the

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,460
peninsula not to influence the North
Koreans they're not influenceable but to

40
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,750
influence the Chinese to amp up the
pressure I do think there is an absolute

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,780
marked difference between the Chinese
response to intercontinental ballistic

42
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,280
missile tests and a nuclear test I
actually do think that's a bit of a

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,040
political redline for the Chinese so
that gives us an opportunity here to try

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,020
to cooperate with the Chinese to get the
region to do more okay so President

45
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,230
Trump is gonna meet with his national
security team later today if you were in

46
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,350
that meeting
on that note on China or maybe anything

47
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,780
else you want to share what would you be
arguing for on how to act right now so

48
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,340
first of all the military options are
all bad they're not zero and the

49
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,060
chairman of the Joint Chiefs is pointed
out there they're never no military

50
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,840
options so we've got them but none of
them are good I think diplomatic

51
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,480
isolation check we've got that this may
be the time now to really hammer home

52
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,930
we're deathly serious about your
performance China on sanctions not just

53
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,709
the ones that were recently passed by
the Security Council but maybe even

54
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,839
amping up the sanctions between China
and North Korea North Korea is dependent

55
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,060
on the Chinese for their energy they can
actually pull the string there

56
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,960
and what do you think is the difference
what what makes you think that trying to

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,880
do that now with China is going to be
any more successful than it was

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,270
yesterday as bad as you and I and the
president view what Kim jong-un did

59
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,220
yesterday with the nuclear test
unbalance I don't think that was aimed

60
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,050
at us I think that was aimed at the
Chinese I think that was little Kim

61
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,320
saying - she's Jinping you can't make me
stop and there I think is a proposition

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,520
that Mister she might not be able to
accept you talk about sort of the

63
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,750
erratic policy and some of the tweets do
you have confidence that President Trump

64
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,740
can handle this I have confidence that
he has a very good team that will lay

65
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,720
out very good options I fear two things
number one the stray electron

66
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,750
all right the the tweet it just goes out
at 5:00 a.m. and it unintentionally

67
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,160
creates effects that make this go to a
place we don't want it to go the other

68
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,340
one is this all right we just got into a
duel with the North Korean chairman with

69
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,530
Kim jong-un if we had a choice of
weapons I think it was a bad choice to

70
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,970
get into a high hyperbole contest with
that kind of guy

71
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,669
the only thing I fear mr. president is
not a manhood issue this is a national

72
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,860
security issue don't don't let your
pride get ahead of white wise policy

73
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,050
here that is very sound advice thank you
so much we hope people are watching in

74
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,110
the White House general Hayden thank you
especially for coming in thank you a

75
00:06:03,110 --> 00:00:00,000
short notice with this breaking news
appreciate it
