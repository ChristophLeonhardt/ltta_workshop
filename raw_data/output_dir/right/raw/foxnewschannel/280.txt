00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:07,531
>> Sean: ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:11,202
SO AS WE EXPECTED FROM FAKE NEWS

3
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:13,104
CNN, BROOK BALDWIN AND DON LEMON

4
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:18,409
ARE DEFENDING AND TRYING TO

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,047
NORMALIZE THE MOB'S BEHAVIOR.

6
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:26,383
>> WHEN YOU SEE TED CRUZ GETTING

7
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:29,086
RUN OUT OF RESTAURANTS BY A

8
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:29,587
MOB --

9
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:30,621
>> YOU'RE MAD.

10
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:31,288
YOU'RE MAD.

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,389
A MOB?

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,023
STOP.

13
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,658
>> THAT IS MOB BEHAVIOR.

14
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,626
>> HOW MANY TIMES HAS THAT

15
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:36,427
HAPPENED --

16
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:37,561
>> STOP, STOP.

17
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:39,663
MATT, WE ALREADY DID THAT.

18
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,365
WE ALREADY SAID THEY WEREN'T

19
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:42,566
MOBS.

20
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:45,736
NO, IT'S NOT MOB BEHAVIOR.

21
00:00:45,737 --> 00:00:47,404
I'M PEOPLE UPSET THAT ARE ANGRY

22
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:48,906
WITH THE WAY THE COUNTRY IS

23
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:51,108
GOING AND THE POLICIES -- WOULD

24
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:52,843
YOU LET ME FINISH BEFORE YOU

25
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,278
JUMP IN?

26
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:54,578
OKAY?

27
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,049
>> Sean: WITH REACTION, AUTHOR

28
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,522
OF THE NEW YORK BEST SELLER,

29
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,924
"TRUMP'S AMERICA", NEWT

30
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:07,291
GINGRICH.

31
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,926
SO WE WATCH THREE WEEKS OF JUST

32
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:12,129
THE ABANDONMENT OF ANY DUE

33
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,831
PROCESS AND PRESUMPTION OF

34
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:14,198
INNOCENCE.

35
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,501
THEN YOU HAVE SARAH SANDERS, PAM

36
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,904
BODY, SECRETARY NIELSON, SENATOR

37
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:23,641
McCONNELL, BEING CHASED OUT OF

38
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:24,308
RESTAURANTS.

39
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:25,142
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS WE CANNOT

40
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:28,746
AS DEMOCRATS BE CIVIL.

41
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:31,182
WHEN ERIC HOLDER SAYS WHEN THEY

42
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:32,449
GO LOW, WE KICK THEM.

43
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,886
WILL THIS WORK IN 27 DAYS?

44
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,588
IS THAT THEIR STRATEGY?

45
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:41,091
>> WELL, WE'RE SEEING THE

46
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:42,426
EMERGENCE OF A BROWN SHIRT

47
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:44,528
PARTY, TO USE THE TERM FOR THE

48
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:47,965
PEOPLE IN GERMANY WHEN OUT AND

49
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:49,266
DOMINATED THE STREETS BY BRUTE

50
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:50,167
FORCE.

51
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,268
THEY CAN'T WIN.

52
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,306
THEY DIDN'T WIN IN THE

53
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:55,706
PRESIDENCY.

54
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:58,142
IN MY JUDGE, THEY'RE NOT GOING

55
00:01:58,143 --> 00:02:00,644
TO WIN ON ELECTION DAY AND

56
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:05,115
THEY'RE BECOMING MORE

57
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:06,584
HYSTERICAL, MORE

58
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,351
ANTI-DEMOCRATIC, MORE WILLING TO

59
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:09,920
DESTROY THE SYSTEM.

60
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,022
ABRAHAM LINCOLN WARNED THAT

61
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:14,592
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE US SO

62
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,126
MUCH IT'S THEIR WAY OR THEY

63
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:16,727
DESTROY IT.

64
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:19,830
WE'RE FACED WITH THAT KIND OF

65
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,231
OPPOSITION.

66
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:23,100
SO LET'S HAVE AN OPEN PUBLIC

67
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:23,467
DEBATE.

68
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:25,569
IF YOU THINK PEOPLE LIKE ERIC

69
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,403
HOLDER, HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD

70
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:30,207
BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL

71
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,443
BY BRUTE VIOLENCE, VOTE

72
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,510
DEMOCRAT.

73
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:35,246
IF YOU THINK THAT'S PROFOUNDLY

74
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:38,215
WRONG, THEN YOU OUGHT TO VOTE

75
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:38,616
REPUBLICAN.

76
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,918
>> Sean: WE HAVE RASMUSSEN

77
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,352
TODAY.

78
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:42,887
REPUBLICANS NOW LEAD DEMOCRATS

79
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:46,056
BY A HEALTHY MARGIN IN TERMS OF

80
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:46,457
ENTHUSIASM.

81
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,826
WHAT WAS TWO MONTHS AGO, A HUGE

82
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:51,495
GAP IN TERMS OF GENERIC BALLOT.

83
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,130
IT'S NOW DEAD EVEN ACCORDING TO

84
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:53,497
RASMUSSEN.

85
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:55,366
THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC SHIFT

86
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:55,666
HERE.

87
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,735
SO GOING FORWARD THE NEXT 27

88
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:59,169
DAYS, YOU'RE A GREAT STRATEGIST,

89
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,838
A GREAT HISTORIAN.

90
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,706
WHAT DO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES

91
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:05,309
SENATE AND HOUSE NEED TO SAY TO

92
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,377
DO AND WIN?

93
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,612
>> LOOK, I THINK MAJORITY LEADER

94
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:11,248
KEVIN McCARTHY HAS GIVEN US A

95
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,450
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF

96
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:16,186
CAMPAIGN THAT WE NEED TO WAGE

97
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:17,221
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

98
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,424
HE'S INTRODUCED A BILL THAT SAYS

99
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:24,395
IF YOU WANT TO STOP FENTANYL FOR

100
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:26,030
KILLING YOUR CHILDREN, IF YOU

101
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,933
WANT TO STOP MS-13 FROM

102
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,134
TERRORIZING YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

103
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,069
IF YOU WANT TO STOP HUMAN

104
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,570
TRACKING, WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE

105
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,471
SOUTHERN BORDER.

106
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:36,006
THE OTHER SIDE SAYS, THE

107
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,309
DEMOCRATS SAY NO, NO, WE NEED

108
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,012
OPEN BORDERS, SANCTUARY CITIES,

109
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,780
ABOLISH ICE.

110
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,448
LET'S HAVE A REFERENDUM.

111
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,450
EVERYBODY THAT THINKS WE DON'T

112
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,352
HAVE ENOUGH CRIME IN AMERICA, WE

113
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,586
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DRUGS IN

114
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:52,122
AMERICA, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

115
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:53,557
VIOLENCE IN AMERICA, VOTE

116
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:53,924
DEMOCRAT.

117
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,225
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT KEVIN

118
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:56,927
McCARTHY IS RIGHT, WE NEED TO

119
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:00,164
CONTROL THE BORDER, GET BACK TO

120
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:03,133
A POINT WHERE OUR CHILDREN AND

121
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:04,134
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE SAFE, VOTE

122
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:04,535
REPUBLICAN.

123
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,171
>> Sean: ARE WE BETTER OFF AS A

124
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:10,607
COUNTRY IN TERMS OF SECURITY?

125
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,209
IS THE ECONOMY BY EVERY MEASURE

126
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,810
BETTER OFF?

127
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:13,777
WE KNOW THE ANSWER.

128
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:14,478
IT'S INTERESTING.

129
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,480
YOU WERE ON MY RADIO SHOW.

130
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:18,015
I MENTIONED IN CALIFORNIA WHERE

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,651
IS UP BY 20 POINTS, IT'S NOW

133
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:23,654
ALMOST WITHIN THE MARGIN OF

134
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:23,954
ERROR.

135
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:25,489
JOHN COX A BUSINESS MAN IS

136
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,658
RUNNING AGAINST HIM.

137
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:30,694
THIS IS A SANCTUARY STATE AND

138
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:34,031
HE'S OFFERING HELL CARE TO

139
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:34,398
EVERYONE.

140
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,035
LEGAL, ILLEGAL, THE HIGHLY TAXED

141
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:40,204
LEVEL OF TAXATION IN CALIFORNIA.

142
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,272
IT PUTS -- ANYBODY THAT GETS

143
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:43,574
SICK IN AMERICA, GO TO

144
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,410
CALIFORNIA AND THEY'LL TAKE CARE

145
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,311
OF YOU I.

146
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:49,446
>> I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH THE

147
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,814
AUDIENCE THAT KNOWS HOW CLOSE

148
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,250
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN FOR ALL OF

149
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,151
THESE YEARS.

150
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:56,120
YOU BLEW ME AWAY ON THE RADIO

151
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:56,420
SHOW.

152
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,188
I WAS STANDING THERE GOING, OH,

153
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:58,756
MY GOD.

154
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,290
THIS IS A NEW WAY OF THINKING

155
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,291
ABOUT IT.

156
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,126
YOU'RE RIGHT.

157
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,728
BASICALLY THE WAY THAT THE

158
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:07,031
DEMOCRATS HAVE SETTLE IT UP IN

159
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:07,998
CALIFORNIA, IF YOU'RE IN

160
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,333
TENNESSEE, NEW YORK OR TEXAS AND

161
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:12,069
YOU HAVE A SERIOUS DISEASE,

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,038
GAVIN NEWSOME IS SENDING YOU A

163
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:14,371

164
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:15,973
COME TO CALIFORNIA AND LET US

165
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:16,874
PAY FOR IT.

166
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,509
EVERY GOVERNOR IN THE COUNTRY

167
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,945
OUGHT TO BE CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM.

168
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,614
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING -- THEY

169
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,182
HAVE A CHANCE HERE TO SEND EVERY

170
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:28,152
SICK PERSON IN THEIR STATE TO

00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,853
CALIFORNIA AND LET NEWSOME DO

172
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:30,421
IT.

173
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:32,089
IF I WERE A CALIFORNIAN, I WOULD

174
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,590
THINK THAT'S INSANE.

175
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,691
BUT YOU PICKED IT UP.

176
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,193
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE

177
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:38,729
DOMESTIC SIDE OF THAT.

178
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,130
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

179
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,231
>> Sean: THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

180
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:41,565
SAYING.

181
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:46,070
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A RESIDENT.

182
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:47,404
13.5% STATE INCOME TAX RIGHT

183
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:47,771
NOW.

184
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:52,543
IT'S GOING TO BE HIGHER.

185
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,845
>> UNDER NEWSOME, IT GETS TO 25.

186
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:55,979
THAT'S MY PREDICTION I.

187
00:05:55,980 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sean: OKAY.
