1
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:10,781
>> Neil: YOU KNOW, YOU CAN

2
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:13,184
ALMOST HEAR REPUBLICANS ACROSS

3
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:26,997
THE COUNTRY AFTER DEBBIE LASKO

4
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:28,766
WON IN ARIZONA.

5
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:29,266
CONGRATULATIONS.

6
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:29,600
WELCOME.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,335
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

8
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:32,336
I APPRECIATE IT.

9
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:35,906
>> YOU KNOW, THERE WERE SO MANY

10
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:37,341
CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR RACE AND

11
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:39,043
THAT YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU WANTED

12
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:41,145
TO WIN OBVIOUSLY, BUT THERE WAS

13
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:42,646
THIS TIDE GOING THAT IT WASN'T

14
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:43,381
HAPPENING THAT WAY.

15
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:45,449
VERY QUICKLY, DEMOCRATS AND MANY

16
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:47,184
IN THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA SAID

17
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:50,454
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T WIN BY THE SAME

18
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:52,323
MARGIN THAT, YOU KNOW, DONALD

19
00:00:52,323 --> 00:00:54,291
TRUMP HAD WON YOUR DISTRICT.

20
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,127
SO HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT AND

21
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:58,629
THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS THAT WERE

22
00:00:58,629 --> 00:00:58,896
HAD?

23
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:01,766
>> WELL, I CERTAINLY WISH I

24
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:04,769
WOULD HAVE WON BY MORE BUT THE

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,070
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I WIN.

26
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,439
WHO IS NOT BEING SAID IS MY

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,975
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT SPENT OVER A

28
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,943
MILLION DOLLARS ON FALSE TV

29
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:14,311
ATTACK ADDS AND I DIDN'T ATTACK

30
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:14,678
HER.

31
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:16,914
SO THAT HAS TO BE PUT IN PLAY AS

32
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:17,314
WELL.

33
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:19,884
HEY, I WON AND I'M A

34
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:21,118
CONGRESSWOMAN AND I'M GOING TO

35
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:22,486
CONTINUE TO WORK HARD FOR THE

36
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:24,221
CONSTITUENTS IN THE WEST VALLEY

37
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:27,558
OF PHOENIX AREA AND ARIZONA.

38
00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:29,527
I'M GOING TO BE GOING TO

39
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:32,563
CONGRESS SOON AND BE SWORN IN

40
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:33,397
PROBABLY MAY 7.

41
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:34,098
>> Neil: THAT SOON?

42
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:35,866
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THE

43
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:36,634
PRESIDENT AT ALL?

44
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:37,368
>> I DID.

45
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:38,803
IT WAS VERY EXCITING.

46
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:40,171
HE CALLED ME YESTERDAY MORNING.

47
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:42,706
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD

48
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:43,140
CONVERSATION.

49
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,242
WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HE

50
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,944
CONGRATULATED ME AND WE TALKED

51
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:49,647
ABOUT ARIZONA AND POLITICS AND

52
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:50,848
HOW THE RACE WENT.

53
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,483
IT WAS A GOOD LONG CONVERSATION.

54
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:54,518
I REALLY APPRECIATED IT.

55
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:56,220
I ASKED HIM IF I COULD GO MEET

56
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,023
HIM IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

57
00:01:59,023 --> 00:01:59,957
HE SAID SURE.

58
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:02,359
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM UP ON

59
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:02,927
THAT.

60
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:04,528
>> Neil: AREN'T YOU A BIG

61
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:04,862
CHEESE.

62
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:07,264
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,

63
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:07,731
CONGRATULATIONS.

64
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:10,334
IT WAS QUITE A HEROIC EFFORT.

65
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,269
IT WAS LOOKING DICEY AS YOU

66
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:13,537
POINTED OUT.

67
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:16,540
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING GIVEN THE

68
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,144
CLOSENESS OF YOUR RACE IN A

69
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:21,545
STRONG REPUBLICAN AREA, MIGHT BE

70
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:22,947
TELEGRAPHING PROBLEMS FOR

71
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:23,581
REPUBLICANS IN NOVEMBER.

72
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,648
DO YOU BUY THAT?

73
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:25,950
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT

74
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,917
A WIN IS A WIN.

75
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:27,818
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

76
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:28,986
A WIN IS A WIN.

77
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:30,387
BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN HAVING

78
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:32,189
A DEVIL OF A TIME IN A LOT OF

79
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,157
THESE CONTESTS.

80
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:34,525
YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN

81
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:36,994
PENNSYLVANIA WITH A FEW OF THOSE

82
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:39,096
CONTESTS AND IN ALABAMA.

83
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:39,830
SPECIAL SITUATIONS.

84
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,666
BUT ALL HAVE BEEN COREY SOME FOR

85
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,067
REPUBLICANS.

86
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:43,868
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

87
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,670
>> I THINK THAT REPUBLICANS NEED

88
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,406
TO CONTINUE TO BE ENERGIZED AND

89
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,175
BECOME MORE ENERGIZED.

90
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:52,810
IT'S NORMAL FOR THE PARTY THAT

91
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,845
IS NOT IN POWER TO BE ENERGIZED

92
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:55,846
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE BACK

93
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:56,881
THE MAJORITY.

94
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,349
THEY WANT TO TAKE BACK THE

95
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,850
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND THE

96
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,419
SENATE AND TAKE BACK THE

97
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:02,820
PRESIDENCY.

98
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,088
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO WORK HARD

99
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:06,991
TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T

100
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:07,324
HAPPEN.

101
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:09,126
I WANT TO BE A CONGRESSWOMAN IN

102
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,394
A MAJORITY CONGRESS.

103
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:13,230
I WANT A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT

104
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,566
THAT IS DOING A GOOD JOB.

105
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,768
>> Neil: YOU WANT TO JOIN THE

106
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:18,702
FREEDOM CAUCUS?

107
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:23,007
40 CONSERVATIVE CONGRESSMEN BUT

108
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:24,308
I STRESS ALL MEN.

109
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:26,577
YOU WOULD BE THE FIRST WOMAN.

110
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:28,112
>> YEAH, ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

111
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:29,747
I'D BE THE FIRST WOMAN BUT THE

112
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:30,748
ONLY WOMAN RIGHT NOW.

113
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:32,516
>> Neil: ONLY WOMAN NOW.

114
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:33,684
>> YEAH.

115
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:35,586
MY CONGRESSMAN, TRENT FRANKS, HE

116
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:38,155
WAS A MEMBER OF THE FREEDOM

117
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:38,489
CAUCUS.

118
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:39,924
ALMOST ALL OF THE CONGRESSMEN

119
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:43,127
FROM ARIZONA ARE MEMBERS OF THE

120
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:43,661
FREEDOM CAUCUS --

121
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,862
>> Neil: ALL OF THOSE MEMBERS AS

122
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:47,765
YOU KNOW VOTED AGAINST THE $1.3

123
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,067
TRILLION SPENDING MEASURE THAT

124
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,202
THE PRESIDENT LAMBASTED.

125
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:55,472
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO RESCIND A

126
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:56,674
LOT OF THAT SPENDING.

127
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:57,908
MITCH McCONNELL SAID HE CAN'T TO

128
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:59,243
THAT, IT'S NOT WISE.

129
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,446
HE AGREED TO IT OR HIS PEOPLE

130
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,648
AGREED TO IT PRIOR SO TOO LATE.

131
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:05,616
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

132
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,351
>> THE PART THAT I LIKED ABOUT

133
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:11,288
IT IS THAT IT INCREASED MILITARY

134
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:13,324
FUNDING AND GAVE RAISES TO THE

135
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:13,958
TROOPS.

136
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:14,959
I LIKE THAT.

137
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,295
THE THING I DON'T LOOK ABOUT IT,

138
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:20,230
INCREASES THE DEFICIT.

139
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,967
IF I WAS THERE, I WOULD HAVE

140
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,068
FOUGHT FOR CUTTING IN AREAS

141
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,170
WHERE THERE'S WASTEFUL SPENDING

142
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,972
SO WE'RE NOT INCREASING THE

143
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:28,272
DEBT.

144
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:29,440
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN

145
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,907
THIS.

146
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:31,909
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO CUT

147
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:32,276
SPENDING.

148
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:33,711
I CERTAINLY THOUGH LIKE THE TAX

149
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,212
CUTS THAT WE DID.

150
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,780
IT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA.

151
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,750
IT'S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY.

152
00:04:39,750 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S GOOD FOR MY CONGRESSIONAL
