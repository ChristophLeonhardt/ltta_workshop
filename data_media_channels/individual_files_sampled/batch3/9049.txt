BORDER CROSSERS, TODAY ANNOUNCING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WILL SEND ANYONE CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER FOR PROSECUTION. JOINS US LIVE. WE HADN'T SET YOU UP OR ASKED YOU TO COME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS DISPUTE BETWEEN THE DOJ AND THE HOUSE BUT YOU ARE JUST CHOMPING AT THE BIT, I CAN SEE, TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. DO YOU THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DID NOT SEE THE LETTER FROM NUNES AND IF NOT, WHY NOT? I THINK HE'S BEING A LITTLE BIT CHARITABLE THERE AND SESSIONS, I RESPECT INCREDIBLY, BUT HIS ANSWER THAT HE JUST SHOWED ON THE CLIP, THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE DETERMINED. THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WORK UNDERNEATH THE PRESIDENT AND THEY ARE COEQUAL TO THE CONGRESS. CONGRESS' ARTICLE ONE BEFORE ARTICLE TWO, THE PRESIDENT. WHEN WE ASK FOR DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ALL REDACTED AND MARKED UP WITH BLACK LINES IT'S NOT US ASKING, IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKING. WE ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE, SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM SESSIONS IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DON'T WANT TO GIVE DOCUMENTS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN RUN OUR GOVERNMENT OF, BY AND FOR THE PEOPLE. Shannon: YOU KNOW THE DOJ SAYS THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDING YOU THE DOCUMENTS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS GETTING CROSSED, WIRES HERE BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'VE PROVIDED DOCUMENTS. THEY HAVE A CENTER SET UP AT DOJ WERE PEOPLE FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE CAN COME AND LOOK AT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. THE MEMO THAT LAUNCHED THE ENTIRE THING, THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, HEAVILY REDACTED. I KNOW THEY SAY THEY CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT BECAUSE THERE'S AN ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BUT THERE IS A FEDERAL JUDGE THAT HAS GIVEN THEM TWO WEEKS TO COUGH IT UP. THERE IS ARTICLE THREE, THE JUDICIARY. THANK GOD A JUDGE HAS STEPPED IN AND SAID YOU DON'T DETERMINE THE SCOPE, I DO. SO THE JUDICIARY, WHY DO THEY GET TO SEE THE REDACTED DOCUMENTS WHEN CONGRESS, WHO HAS OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE, DOESN'T? CONGRESS IS NUMBER ONE BECAUSE WE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE'S INTEREST. THE PEOPLE'S INTEREST IS BEING DISMISSED HERE. Shannon: WE WILL ALLOW THERE IS SOME AGREEING TO DISAGREE BETWEEN THE HOUSE G.O.P. AND THE DOJ. LET'S TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL VERY TOUGH ON THIS TODAY, INCLUDING THIS MESSAGE HE SAID ABOUT THOSE WHO WOULD TRY TO BRING YOUNGSTERS INTO THE U.S. IF YOU SMUGGLE ILLEGAL ALIENS ACROSS OUR BORDER THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU. IF YOU ARE SMUGGLING A CHILD THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU. AND THAT CHILD MAY BE SEPARATED FROM YOU AS REQUIRED BY LAW. Shannon: "THE NEW YORK TIMES" PICKING UP ON THAT. THEY SAID MORE THAN 700 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ADULTS CLAIMING TO BE THEIR PARENTS SINCE OCTOBER. THEY GO ON TO QUOTE SOMEONE SAYING THE IDEA OF PUNISHING PARENTS FOR TRYING TO SAVE THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES IS FUNDAMENTALLY CRUEL AND UN-AMERICAN. THAT'S DIRECTOR OF MIGRANT RIGHTS AND THE JUSTICE PROGRAM AT THE WOMEN'S REFUGEE COMMISSION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? YOU LISTEN, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS WE ARE DOING THAT IN SOME CASES. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY YOU NEED TO PASS THE GOODLATTE BILL. IT'S A WELL THOUGHT OUT RATIONAL POLICY THAT IS SYSTEMATIC AND COVERS ALL OF THESE BASES. THE LEFT, WE WILL GIVE YOU 700,000 DACA RELIEF. BRING THE KIDS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, THAT'S COMPASSIONATE. TRUMP EVEN WENT BEYOND THAT, HE SAID TO MILLIE. THE LEFT SAYS NO TO THAT DEAL. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP FROM HAPPENING AS WE WANT TO BE COMPASSIONATE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE SHADOWS, BUT IF WE KEEP SHOWING COMPASSION OVER AND OVER AND OVER WE SEND A SIGNAL AND PUT OUT A GREEN LIGHT, KEEP COMING FROM HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, SOUTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA ACROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE RULE OF LAW ANYMORE. AND THAT WE HAVE TO BE STIFF ON. WE NEED TO SEND A VERY CLEAR SIGNAL AND WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP FIRST CAME INTO OFFICE OF THE BORDER CROSSINGS WENT WAY DOWN. IT'S ONLY AFTER WE HAVE GOTTEN LAX. PAUL RYAN PROMISED US WE WOULD PASS THAT GOODLATTE BILL THIS YEAR AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT WILL SEND A SIGNAL TO THE REST OF THE WORLD, THE UNITED STATES IS A BEACON OF LIBERTY. WE ARE WELCOMING, WE ARE COMPASSIONATE. WE USED TO BRING IN ABOUT 500,000 FOLKS LEGALLY, NOW A MILLION AND A HALF LAST YEAR LEGALLY. THEY WENT THROUGH THE LINE AND NOW FOLKS ARE COMING AND CLAIMING REFUGEE STATUS, SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN COAXED, ET CETERA. IF THAT PROGRESSIVE GROUPS WORKING WITH THEM. THAT'S BEEN ON THE NEWS EVERY NIGHT FOR THE PAST WEEK. SESSIONS GOT IT RIGHT, WE NEED TO MAKE A FIRM ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WILL FOLLOW THE LAW AND YOU SEE THAT IS A CONTINUING THEME. AFTER THE OBAMA YEARS THE CERTAINTY IN THE LAW WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE BORDER AND THE FBI AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. ALL OF THIS IS IN QUESTION RIGHT NOW SO WE HAVE TO RESTORE CREDIBILITY TO ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS AND WE WILL GET IT STRAIGHT. IN A FEW YEARS WE WILL HAVE THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE THE COMPASSIONATE COUNTRY WE ARE, BUT COMPASSION, GRACE GOES WITH THE LAW. Shannon: WANTED TO TALK TO ABOUT NAFTA. WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THAT? WE ARE OUT OF TIME. THOSE NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE AND
