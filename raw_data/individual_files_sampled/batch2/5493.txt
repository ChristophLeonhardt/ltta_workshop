electoral votes did he get out meet me very excited because he has Chris Matthews here and last night Chris's up he was a wanted no words two nights ago nights ago what was last night I'll think of it Amica wanted to call you yeah after the hope Hicks resignation I had some and she wanted you did say oh that was an easy one losing hope I mean there's so many oh please but I think it has been weird how about having the chair there yesterday empty with his name on it yeah and at the press comes what was the one having the empty chair so let me ask you a question we've all been talking about how there's anything this is bad for the administration this is bad for Paul but nobody let me that's what that's the general talk it's been the general talk what about in Penson what about in Pennsylvania 18 I think he's gonna at least talk about this until after the special election Pennsylvania 18 does this help him well maybe the purpose of it right and I think that I've noticed it sherrod Brown of Ohio and and Joe Manchin and Bobby Casey of Pennsylvania what come out for this because all politics is local or the tariffs and those peur a retired person a retired person in Pennsylvania earier screen what do you really want out of life you don't have really great hopes for being something different you want Social Security Medicare and maybe Medicaid for long-term care for Alzheimer's and you wanted your kids to get jobs close enough they can drive home right not go for too far away and this is about trying to keep some of the jobs in Pennsylvania this is this is Pat Buchanan's stuff it's economic nationalism it's the feeling people have the Trump said I will be with you imagine be going the other way this will not sell is Hillary con I know but the House Pat Buchanan's message in 1990 I know it'll work I hope you get 25 years ago still there who's still there the Pennsylvania voters are the jobs still there well their hope is still there that the culture is still there and this is a cultural issue as much an economic issue you've got to say look at Donald Trump the battle will be won or lost in 2020 in Wisconsin a Michigan in Pennsylvania it's not going to be fought in the voter though understands even in Pennsylvania does he not that if the factories come back and there are a lot of factories that are still around Pittsburgh that the jobs don't come back it's automated I think there's a sense that the Chinese are going to grab all the steel industry they're going to take it and by the way this sophisticated you know terms of trade this whole idea of least comparative disadvantage we're all taught in graduate school about economics that's great for New York and some of the big cities and the height but for the what are we cha is now go there's Africa and starts building Cobra funding plans and la mu because they've got all this exchange they can do anything they want with their with their tremendous trade advantage in the world we've got to do something so your answer winning so you're answering my question in the affirmative this helps Donald Trump in Pennsylvania yeah this helps Donald Trump in Ohio that's right that's right it's because its cultural and it's emotional he's looking out for people that nobody else is looking what about in Wisconsin what about in Michigan what we're gonna say I mean I think this thing's gonna shake itself down I'm listening to what McConnell is saying and what Ryan are saying that'll become much more surgical but it will end up with one message Donald Trump looked out for us and those sophisticates in New York with their advanced degrees you I don't need steel to make a living yeah by the way many people talking here for the last hour made any money in their head with their hands lately well I mean I don't really want to get into it it's a long story the point of view that comes from the gritty people out there Pennsylvania we're probably cheering this on by the way what do you think pave Kasey's for this why do you think your shirt Browns right because they're smart politicians who want to get reelected yeah now speaking of sophisticates who have never done any work with their hands that sort of like that scene in trading places where where they where she looks at dan Ackroyd's hands and since you've never done an honest day of work in your life we bring in sophisticate from Boston Oh professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and legacy University the man to which George Wallace came up with the term pointy headed bureaucrat we give you ladies daniel Dresner in new york MSNBC contributor mike barnicle who probably will agree with with chris and also we have our we have tv's own willie geist so dan actually brought you on to explain if you will that if there are people in Pennsylvania that think this is good for them or our people in Ohio that think this is good for them talk about the trade-offs how do these tariffs hurt working-class Americans when they go to buy things in Walmart in Sam's Club in their grocery store when they go to try to get a used car to give to their kids when they're about to drive off to college so basically these tariffs hurt ordinary working-class Americans in two ways the first is they're gonna raise consumer prices the price of every steel using industry is about to go up which even people like Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro acknowledged they just sort of claimed well it's just a small tax just a couple hundred dollars on a car which I guarantee you is really important to a working class and don't regard vania mmm-hmm the second thing by the way is you know to push back on Chris's point the notion that this somehow is just you know free trade just benefits if feed intellectuals on the coast is absurd the fact is the trade partnership which has produced the first analysis of what these tariffs will do suggests that it will create you know a net loss of a hundred and fifty thousand jobs primarily in the manufacturing industry and last I checked they are still using industries in Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan and Wisconsin as well so the idea that this is somehow some kind of a net gain is absolutely absurd it's dumb ass economics well don't see and that's right okay see sometimes he breaks that he doesn't sound very we know better and that's all the people that they want to hear is we know better well Maya that'll solve all the price like Mike Barnicle though this is this is not voodoo economics it's it's witchcraft economics and yes it will help maybe a hundred and fifty thousand two hundred thousand people across America it will hurt three hundred three hundred and twenty five million people whose whose cost of living goes up will it not look at Joe dan just pointed out the facts and those are the facts but loss is the key word and what we're talking about here would Chris and I are talking about here I think is not just loss but it's nostalgia it's the loss of so much over two or three decades that affected so many people losses that are never coming back but these are the same people who win the when the economy crashed in 2008 and 2009 many of them lost their homes they lost their 401ks they lost their hope in this country what little hope they had left of the job down the down the corner down the street in the same town that they grew up on many of these people also are the people who risk losing their sons and daughters in a war that's been going on for 16 years now so losses the key and lost triumphs over facts Dean has facts but losses emotion losses nostalgia and loss sends people to the polls no Casey I I think to a certain extent whatever the President may be doing here that has to do with pa-18 is a little bit of a Hail Mary I mean everybody that I am talking to thinks the Republicans they're gonna lose this race at this point I mean the NRCC just dumped another over half a million dollars they've spent millions trying to prop up their candidate Democrats have somebody who really fits the district he's from there he's a veteran you know the people who have seen him speak say hey this guy is really pretty impressive so I think the tide turning look at the Emerson College full color lamb 48% we have sat Cohn 45% this is again 20% for trial 20% for Trump is I mean it is a Republican district this race should not be closed and you know I was going to even say the day after if the Republicans only win by one or two points that's still going to be another example of massive underperformance by the GOP in 2018 yeah this is a this is just the next data point and you know obviously there's you know another week before the election so we'll sort of see how it ends up right but you know there it is clear that Trump is playing politics with all of this and I think you know the crisp and and Mike are both making compelling points about the residents of the politics here but don't tell you their word playing politics well but now we talk about politics now how about winning election but this expectation of our president how many shows the Gary they're looking at for a collective national best interest and it is not in our best interest to implement policies that have a retreads of 25300 it's worked all these years for Pennsylvania Ohio it's worked for them huh this free trade policy no I'm not saying that Chris what I'm saying is we need to have a forward-looking trade policy that actually does benefit our domestic economy in a more effective way that is something that you have you how do we keep steel how do we keep steel steel what we're trying to do is create create jobs and look what we're trying to do is create jobs in the most difficult for us to do that is to make sure that we are letting the US economy and all the advantages that we have here benefit working people dan Dresner dumb math politics go we don't have a problem with steel steel production is actually up we have a problem with steel jobs and the reason is that the steel industry even in this country is so productive that even if you apply these tariffs I think the estimates suggest that you're only going to create about 50,000 jobs no less than 50,000 you're gonna lose on the other hand 150,000 jobs the problem here isn't really trade the problem is productivity we are so good at making stuff that we don't need any workers so quit saying that the steel industry is in trouble the problem is workers in the steel industry are facing a challenge and the answer of that is not boosting the steel industry the answer to that is boosting other sectors where these people can get good jobs so the president has proposed an infrastructure program that's one way you can do this so Dan if Detroit could and if Detroit could somehow build all the cars that Americans drive in this country it it wouldn't be like 1955 it wouldn't be like 1960 I heard some remarkable stat that if you just looked at the number of people that worked in General Motors in the early 1980s you had more people employed then than you have in all of these high-tech jobs in Silicon Valley that we rave about day in and day out that's largely correct that what's happened essentially is the manufacturing is essentially gone the way of agriculture you know if you remember 150 years ago most Americans were farmers no one thinks that America is not an agricultural powerhouse right now even though approximately 2% of Americans work in that sector and the reason is is that we're so productive at it so the idea that you're going to somehow blame other countries for what is essentially a Productivity revolution is absurd and I would have one other thing on this which is to say that Donald Trump somehow seems to think that running trade deficits is a sign of weakness is a sign that America is losing there is one other economic bloc in history that practiced the notion that we only have to have sort of you know a complete trade balance which each each participating country and that block was comic-con and was led by the Soviet Union and that didn't work out terribly well so I would suggest that this sort of policy is not going to benefit the United States and if it leads to a wider trade battle then frankly even voters in Pennsylvania might actually recognize that whatever small temporary advantage they've gotten from these tariffs have actually nonetheless cause larger widespread damage to the American economy by the way let me just say do the good people of Pennsylvania Isle of voters in Pennsylvania you know larger thoughts here is you always have to be careful watching the political strategy about Pennsylvania like I've talked about this south my entire life just say I see a third party opportunity there right yeah there well I got thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest
