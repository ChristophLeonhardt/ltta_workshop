SIDE.
HERE IS THE INTERVIEW WITH
AL-JUBEIR.
BRET: JOINING US, ADEL
AL-JUBEIR.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
BRET: THERE IS SCEPTICISM AROUND
THE WORLD, HERE IN WASHINGTON,
ALL OVER OF THE LATEST
EXPLANATION ABOUT THE
DISAPPEARANCE AND DEATH OF JAMAL
KHASHOGGI.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO
LAY OUT THE LATEST EXPLANATION
AND HOW YOU CAME TO THIS.
>> WE HAD AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CAME
TO THE CONSULATE, HE WAS
APPROACHED BY THE SAUDI SECURITY
TEAM.
THEY TOLD US HE LEFT THE
CONSULATE.
THE THEY DISPATCHED A TEAM TO
TURKEY.
REPORTS WE WERE GETTING FROM
TURKEY, THEY DIRECTED THE PUBLIC
PROSECUTOR TO LAUNCH AN
INVESTIGATION WHICH HE DID.
HE DISCOVERED THERE WERE
DISCREPANCIES.
WE DISCOVERED HE WAS KILLED IN
THE CONSULATE.
WE DON'T KNOW IN DETAILS HOW.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BODY IS.
THE PROSECUTOR PUT OUT ORDERS TO
DETAIN 18 INDIVIDUALS FOR
QUESTIONING AND POSSIBLY FACING
TRIAL.
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN A LONG
JOURNEY.
WE ARE DETERMINED TO UNCOVER
EVERY STONE AND FIND OUT ALL THE
FACTS AND PUNISH THOSE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MURDER.
AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO INSURE
THAT THE INFORMATION WE HAVE
WITH INTELLIGENCE IN THE FIELD
HAS CHECKS AND BALANCES INTO
SURE THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN
AGAIN.
BRET: YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE BODY IS.
SOMEONE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS.
WAS IT CHOPPED UP AND
DISMEMBERED?
>> WE ARE WORK ON THIS WITH OUR
TURKISH COLLEAGUES, THE
PROSECUTE YEARS CONTINUING HIS
QUESTIONING.
WE ARE INTENT ON UNCOVERING ALL
THE FACTS THAT EXIST IN THIS
CASE.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE
RESPONSIBLE ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT.
BRET: WHY DID IT TAKE 18 DAYS
FOR THE SAUDI STORY GEL?
FIRST IT WAS THAT HE WALKED OUT
OF THE CONSULATE.
THEN IT WAS SILENCE.
THEN THIS FAILED EXPLANATION
MINUS WHERE THE BODY IS, AND WHO
ORDERED IT.
>> WE HAD REPORTS THAT INDICATED
THAT HE LEFT THE CONSULATE.
THEN OUR INVESTIGATING TEAM IN
TURKEY DISCOVERED THERE WERE
ELEMENTS THAT CONTRADICTED WHAT
WAS IN THE REPORT.
THEN THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR WANTS
TO DO AN INVESTIGATION AND HE
DETERMINED NAWBLG THERE WAS
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED THAT WAS
CRIMINAL AND AS A CONSEQUENCE --
WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE
THIS YOU WANT THE INFORMATION
YOU PUT OUT TO BE AS ACCURATE AS
YOU POSSIBLY CAN.
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT OUT
SPECULATION AND HEARSAY AND
GOSSIP.
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME.
YOU LOOK AT THE TIMELINE BETWEEN
WHEN THE INCIDENTS WERE
DISCOVERED AND THE REPORT CAME
OUT OF WHAT HAPPENED.
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME AND YOU
WANT TO BE CAREFUL.
BRET: YOU ARE AN AUTHORITARIAN
GOVERNMENT.
YOU ARE SAYING THE CROWN PRINCE
DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS EVEN
THOUGH THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THIS
15-PERSON TEAM THAT ARE CLOSELY
ALIGNED WITH HIM?
>> FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE MEAN IN
THE AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT.
WE ARE A MONARCHY.
WE HAVE OUR CHECKS AND BALANCES.
THE INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE THE
AUTHORITY THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS
MISTAKE MADE AND COMPOUNDED THE
MISTAKE BY TRYING TO COUCH.
THESE THINGS UNFORTUNATELY
HAPPEN.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE WHO
ARE RESPONSIBLE ARE PUNISHED AND
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE PROCEDURES
ARE IN PLACE TO PREVENT IT FROM
HAPPENING AGAIN.
SAUDI ARABIA SINCE THE FOUNDING
OF THE MODERN SAUDI STATE WE
HAVE NEVER ENGAGED IN SUCH
BEHAVIOR.
THIS IS AN ABERRATION, IT'S A
CRIMINAL ACT AND THOSE
RESPONSIBLE WILL BE PUNISHED.
BRET: DID THE CROWN PRINCE KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT IF THERE WERE
PEOPLE CLOSELY TIED TO HIM THAT
WERE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THE
OPERATION.
>> THERE WERE PICTURES OF SOME
SECURITY OFFICERS IN THE
SECURITY DETAIL FROM TIME TO
TIME.
BUT THIS IS NORMAL SECURITY,
PEOPLE WHO DEAL IN SECURITY
DETAILS ROTATE AMONG THE
OFFICIALS.
HAVING SOMEBODY IN A PICTURE
DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE CLOSE AT
ALL.
THE CROWN PRINCE IS NOT AWARE OF
THIS.
THIS WAS AN OPERATION THAT WAS A
ROGUE OPERATION.
THIS WAS AN OPERATION WHERE
INDIVIDUALS ENDED UP 
THE RESPONSIBILITIES THEY HAD.
THEY TRIED TO COVER UP FOR IT.
BRET WHERE WHAT DO YOU SAY -- DO
YOU BELIEVE THAT THE TURKS HAVE
AUDIO OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT
CONSULATE?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
THEY SAID THEY HAVE AUDIO, BUT
WE HAVEN'T HEARD IT.
AND I DON'T KNOW ANY GOVERNMENT
THAT HAS ACCESS TO THOSE
AUDIOTAPES.
BRET: DO YOU BELIEVE THE U.S.
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HAS
INTERCEPTS THAT HAS
UNDERSTANDING AT A HIGH LEVEL OF
THIS OPERATION?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD US
ABOUT IT.
I SEE A LOT OF SPECULATION AND
HEARSAY AND GOSSIP IN THE PRESS.
I CAUTION PEOPLE TO LET THE
INVESTIGATION UNFOLD.
AND WHEN THE RESULTS COME OUT,
WE'LL KNOW THE TRUTH.
BRET: YOU UNDERSTAND THE
SCEPTICISM, THAT THIS WAS A
FIGHT THAT DEVELOPED IN THE
CONSULATE, AND A 0-YEAR-OLD
COLUMNIST -- A 60-YEAR-OLD
COLUMNIST WRITER IS GOING TO
RESIST A 15-MEMBER SECURITY TEAM
AND ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE
TEAM WAS AN AUTOPSY SPECIALIST.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE ALL 15
MEMBERS WERE IN THE CONSULATE
WHEN THIS HAPPENED.
WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY
INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE TEAM.
WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW
THEY WERE AACCEPT
THEY WERE A -CEPT
THEY WERE A --EPT
THEY WERE A -- HT
THEY WERE A -- HOW THEY WERE
ASSEMBLED AND DISPATCHED AND
WHAT HAPPENED CONSEQUENT TO
THAT.
THE INITIAL RESULTS ARE NOT
CONCLUSIVE.
THE INVESTIGATION IS IN ITS
EARLY PHASES.
WE'LL PURSUE THIS TO THE END TO
UNCOVER THE TRUTH TO MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED
AND WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
BRET: I'M SURE YOU HEARD
LAWMAKERS SPEAKING OUT.
HERE IS WHAT SENATOR RAND PAUL
SAID ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY."
>> I FEEL CERTAIN THE CROWN
PRINCE WAS INVOLVED AND HE
DIRECTED THIS AND WE CAN'T
CONTINUE TO HAVE RELATIONS WITH
HIM.
HE'LL HAVE TO BE REPLACED.
SANCTIONS DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH.
BRET: THERE WERE A LOT OF
WASHINGTON LAWMAKERS IN THE SAME
BOAT.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND.
>> I FIND IT INTERESTING HOW
SOMEONE 6,000 MILES AWAY CAN
HAVE AN OPINION ON THE INCIDENT.
THIS IS A JUDGMENT CALL BY
SENATOR PAUL BASED ON
SPECULATION.
WITH RESPECT TO THE CONGRESS TO
WAIT UNTIL THEY HAVE THE FACTS,
THEN JUDGE THE RESULTS OF THE
FACTS AND TAKE POSITIONS THEN.
BUT NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS
BEFORE SOMETHING IS CONCLUDE.
THERE IS A PRESUMPTION OF
INNOCENCE AND PEOPLE HAVE TURNED
IT UPSIDE DOWN UNFORTUNATELY.
BRET: ARE YOU WORRIED THAT
SOMETHING IN THIS INVESTIGATION
WILL TURN UP SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THAN THE ORIGINAL STORY YOU PUT
OUT NOW?
>> WE PUT OUT THE VERSION WE
HAVE BASED ON THE FACTS WE HAD
AT THE TIME.
WE'LL CONTINUE TO PUT OUT
INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES
AVAILABLE AND IT IS CERTIFIED.
WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR WE'LL LEAVE
NO STONE UNTURNED.
BRET: KING SALMAN IS STANDING
BEHIND THE CROWN PRINCE ON ALL
OF THIS?
>>  THE INVESTIGATION
TO ASCERTAIN THE FACTS AND HOLD
THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE
AND DETERMINE TO PUT IN PLACE
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND
MEASURES IN THE SECURITY
SERVICES TO PREVENT SOMETHING
LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.
BRET: WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED
SURROUNDING THIS?
>> THIS IS UP TO THE COURTS TO
DECIDE.
THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR WILL BRING
CHARGES AS THE INVESTIGATION
UNFOLDS.
THEY WILL BE REFERRED TO THE
COURTS AND THE COURTS WILL
SENTENCE THEM.
BRET: DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE TO
THE KHASHOGGI FAMILY?
>> YES, THIS IS A TERRIBLE
MISTAKE, A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
WE FEEL THEIR PAIN.
I WISH THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN.
UNFORTUNATELY A FEW 
WAS MADE AND I ASSURE THOSE
RESPONSIBLE WILL BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS.
BRET: YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME AS
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., NOW AS
FOREIGN MINISTER.
HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THE
FUTURE OF THE U.S.-SAUDI
RELATIONSHIP AFTER ALL THIS?
>>  GREAT INTERESTS
THAT WE SHARE TOGETHER.
WE HAVE A GREAT TRADE
RELATIONSHIP.
WE HAVE SECURITY ISSUES
IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF US.
WE WORK CLOSELY ON COMBATING
TERRORISM AND EXTREMISM AND
CONTAINING IRAN'S AGGRESSIVE
POLICIES IN THE REGION.
TRYING TO BRING PEACE TO
PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN.
THE STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP IS
IMPORTANT FOR BOTH COUNTRIES.
I BELIEVE WHEN THE INVESTIGATION
IS OVER AND THE FACTS ARE
REVEALED, PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE AND SEE THOSE
INDIVIDUALS PUNISHED, THAT THE
