Bret: I'M SAYING THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE A HORRIBLE THING. AND NOT STANDING UP AND SPEAKING THE TRUTH ARE SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT IN A WAY THAT THEM, WHAT HAVE YOU. SO WHEN I SAID I STAND BY MY STAND UP. MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD AND EXPLAINED WHY YOU THINK THEY ARE WRONG AND YOU ARE RIGHT. SHOULD CALL FOR THE HARASSMENT OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THAT MAXINE WATERS DID OVER THE WEEKEND, REACTING TO THE STORY ABOUT SARAH SANDERS BEING THROWN OUT OF THE RESTAURANT IN VIRGINIA. YOU NEED TO TELL THEM THEY ARE NOT WELCOME ANYWHERE, ANYMORE. THE PRESIDENT TWEETING OUT ABOUT EXTRAORDINARILY LOW IQ PERSON, AS COME TOGETHER WITH NANCY PELOSI. SHE HAS JUST CALLED FOR HARM FOR SUPPORTERS, OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY INDIAN MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN MOVEMENT. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, MAX." WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT ALL THIS? CHARLES HERBERT, OPINION EDITOR FOR "THE WASHINGTON TIMES" ." CHARLIE? YOU KNOW YOU HAVE PROBABLY GONE TOO FAR WHEN YOU HAVE CHUCK SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI PULLING HER CHAIN BACK A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH. I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT REALLY EXCITES A LOT OF A SORT OF THE MOST RABID SUPPORTERS ON THE LEFT, NOT LEFT, THE MOST VOCIFEROUS HATERS OF DONALD TRUMP. BUT IT'S NOT HELPING THEM WIN ANY NEW VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE. WITH THE VAST COMPLEXITIES ON THE BORDER, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IF THE OTHER CHOICES MAXINE WATERS GOING OUT AND SAYING, PESTER THESE PEOPLE IN PUBLIC. I THINK MOST VOTERS ARE GOING TO SORT OF GO OR BE FORCED TOWARDS THE TRUNK VERSION. Bret: IF THIS DOES HAPPEN A LOT IT SEEMS WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING AT A POLITICAL UPSIDE, FOR A STORY THAT IS MEATY CRATERING ON THE REPUBLICAN HEIDI HEITKAMP AND JOE DONNELLY, PARTY TO BE THE LEFT WING MIRROR IMAGE OF THE THINGS THEY DON'T LIKE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. AND THAT IS THE CHALLENGE. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S WRONG BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN DONALD TRUMP DID IT. SECOND OF ALL IT'S TACTICALLY STUPID BECAUSE IT WILL BACKFIRE HIS SUPPORTERS ARE THE VICTIMS OF THE LEFT WING MOB. SO IT'S NOT GOING TO LEAD TO ANYTHING GOOD FOR DEMOCRATS AND THAT'S WHY YOU SAW HER CALLED OUT AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE THE MERITS. IT'S ENCOURAGING THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE CHALLENGED WHAT THEY HAVE SAID, AND DAVID AXELROD NUMBER OF FOLKS ON THE LEFT TO APPLAUD THE EXPULSION OF SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS FROM THE RESTAURANT AND THEN WENT ON TO THERE IS NO LONG-TERM UPSIDE IN THIS KIND OF INCIVILITY. POLITICS IS THE ART OF PERSUASION AND OF THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE LONG-TERM GAINS IN POLITICS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO A BETTER JOB OF PERSUADING OTHERS THAT TAKE POLITICAL MOMENTS AND MAKE THEM POLITICAL MOVEMENTS. THESE ARE NOT ABOUT ARGUMENTS, WERE NOT PERSUADING ANYBODY. IF DEMOCRATS FOLLOW MAXINE WATERS' ADVICE AND GET IN THE FACE OF DEMOCRATS AND HARASS THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS? AND IT GOES THE OTHER WAY TOO. DONALD TRUMP MADE ONE OF THOSE COMMENTS, DID HE ACTUALLY THINK HE MIGHT CONVERT A DEMOCRAT THAT COULD BE PERSUADED BY AN ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF HIS POLICY? SHORT TERM. Bret: IT RIGHT. I SAID I WAS GOING TO COME AS OF LATE FRIEND OF CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. HERE'S WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS POLITICALLY. THEY DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE, THIS IS THE SAME REGION THAT HILLARY WAS. THEY ARE NOW FIXATED ON TRUMP AND IT'S ALL ON THE RESISTANCE, ALL ABOUT TRUMP. BUT THINK OF THE BIG PICTURE, WHY DO THEY WANT TO WIN THE HOUSE? ONE REASON. NOT TAX REFORM, NOT JOBS. THEY WANT TO WIN SO THEY CAN START ON IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT AND UNDOING THE ELECTION OF 2016. THAT'S OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL MISTAKE AND POLITICAL STRATEGY I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT A WORTHY CAUSE. Bret: ONE YEAR AGO THIS WEEK. THROUGH LONG COMPLICATED LEGAL PROCESSES IS NOT THE WAY TO GO. WE WILL ALWAYS BE DYSFUNCTIONAL PEOPLE, AND THEY MUST BE STOPPED AT THE BORDER AND NOT BE BROUGHT ANY LEGALLY. IF THIS IS DONE, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WILL BE STOPPED IN ITS TRACKS AND, THIS IS THE ONLY REAL ANSWER AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO BUILD THE WALL. IS SO LAST WEEK DONALD TRUMP HAD EVERYTHING THROWN AT HIM BY EVERYBODY BASED ON THESE IMAGES DOWN ON THE BORDER, SOME OF AND OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR OF COURSE BEING THE PHOTOSHOP COVER OF "TIME" MAGAZINE, WHERE IT HAS DONALD TRUMP LOOKING AT THIS GIRL WHO IS CRYING AT IT TURNS OUT THAT CHILD WAS NEVER SEPARATED FROM HER PARENTS AND IN FACT, FOR THE REPORTING'S SHOWS OF THE MOTHER HAD LEFT HER OTHER CHILDREN BACK HOME WHICH SUGGESTS THAT MAYBE IT'S A SIGN SHE IS NOT GOING TO SUCCEED IN GETTING ASYLUM AND DOESN'T DESERVE ASYLUM BASED ON THE CRITERIA. BUT NOW AFTER A WEEK OF THE HYSTERIA HAS SORT OF PAST AND, WE ARE STILL DOWN TO A REALLY COMPLICATED SITUATION ON THE BORDER, I THINK THAT MOVED BY DONALD TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE FROM GETTING INTO THE COUNTRY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE THEM DUE PROCESS, IT'S AN ARGUMENT FOR BUILDING A WALL. OR ANYTHING, SOMETHING THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM GETTING ACROSS THE BORDER BORDER. I AGREE LAST WEEK WAS A BAD PRETTY MUDDLED. WE ARE STRONG ON BORDERS, THE DEMOCRATS ARE WEAK ON BORDERS, THAT SAFER GROUND FOR HIM. A DON McGAHN ASYLUM PROCESS IS TO SEE WHETHER THEY DESERVE TO BE LET INTO THE COUNTRY OR NOT. TO DECIDE BY FEE AT THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO, OR SEND THEM OVER THE BORDER TO MEXICO, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A UNDERCOVER. THE FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF JAY JOHNSON TALKING ABOUT NOT ONLY CHILD SEPARATION BUT STOPPING PEOPLE AT THE BORDER. WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE IMAGES AND THE REALITY FROM 2014 JUST DETENTION. WE HAD THEN 34,000 BEDS FOR FAMILY DETENTION AND ONLY 95 OF 34,000 EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH WE BELIEVED IT WAS NECESSARY AT FAMILIES. WE CAN'T HAVE CATCH AND RELEASE. WHILE THERE WERE NO PEOPLE BEING KICKED OUT OF RESTAURANTS. LOTS OF THINGS WERE MISSING BUT ONE THING THAT WAS MISSING WAS WHAT WE WERE SEEING WASN'T ON PRECEDENT. THE REASON IT WAS HAPPENING IN INCREASING NUMBERS WAS UNPRECEDENTED. IT WAS A RESULT OF IT POLICY DECISION THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD MADE BECAUSE I WANTED THIS TO SERVE AS A DETERRENT. THE ALL OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT AND THEY ARGUED THAT WHAT THEY DID, THEY HAD TO DO, AND IT WAS REGRETTABLE. BUT IT HAPPENED. WE DIDN'T HEAR IT HAPPEN UNTIL SEVERAL DAYS INTO THE DEBATE WHICH WAS A FAILURE ON MAINSTREAM MEDIA. CHARLIE IS RIGHT, THERE IS ALL THIS NAVEL-GAZING AMONG JOURNALISTS THESE DAYS ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO RESTORE CREDIBILITY. WHILE THE FIRST THING IS GET THE STORY RIGHT. BY A MISLEADING IMAGE.
