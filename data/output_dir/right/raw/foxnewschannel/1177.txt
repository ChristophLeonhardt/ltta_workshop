THE SAFEST IN THE WORLD IN PART

8
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,218

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:29,727
PRESSURED THE FAA TO MEET

NO ONE WILL EXPLAIN IT NOW.

22
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:39,837
WE CALLED THE FAA TODAY AND WE

23
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:41,239
GOT SILENCE WHEN WE ASK THAT

24
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:41,940
QUESTION, WHICH IS THE MOST

25
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,608
BASIC QUESTION.

26
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:46,211
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

27
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:48,012
STARTING IN 2014 THEY ADDED A

28
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:49,347
BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONNAIRE TO

SEARCHED FOR UNQUALIFIED AIR

40
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:08,366

41
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,201
THAT IS INSANE AND THEY KNEW IT

42
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,102
WAS INSANE WHEN THEY DID IT BUT

43
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:13,371
THEY DID IT ANYWAY.

44
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:15,373
TODAY WE OBTAINED NEW

ADMITS THAT THE TEST HE DEVISED

51
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:26,651

00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:31,356
CONTROLLERS, FIND PEOPLE WITH

56
00:01:31,356 --> 00:01:33,825
EXPERIENCE, THAT WAS HIS ADVICE.

57
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,927
THE FAA IGNORED THIS AND USED

58
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:37,295
THE BIOGRAPHICAL SCREEN ANYWAY.

59
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:38,162
THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT FINDING

THE FAA'S TOP SPOKESMAN.

67
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:50,241
WE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE FAA

68
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:51,409
WOULD EVER USE TOTALLY

69
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:52,176
IRRELEVANT CRITERIA SUCH AS WHAT

70
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:54,479

WE ALSO ASKED THE ACTING FAA

75
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:02,687
ADMINISTRATOR DANIEL EWELL TO

76
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:05,556
COME ON THIS SHOW AND EXPLAIN

77
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:06,424
EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON AND

78
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:08,826
WHY HE WAS TOO COWARDLY TO

79
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:09,426
APPEAR.

80
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:10,094

MICHAEL WHERE TO, THE ONE WHO

82
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,630
ORIGINALLY SIGNED OFF ON THE

83
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,964
POLICY.

84
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:14,232
HE'S ALSO A COWARD.

85
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:15,867
BUT WE ARE GOING TO KEEP PUSHING

86
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,068
UNTIL WE GET AN ANSWER.

87
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:18,336
IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE JOINED BY

88
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:20,605
FORMER AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

89

MICHAEL PEARSON, WHO IS ALSO A

90
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,574
LAWYER AND IS SUING THE FAA OVER

91
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:23,975
ALL OF THIS.

92
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,910
WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.

93
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,378
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.

94
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:28,680
>> Tucker: I WANT TO BE

95
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,615
CERTAIN I DIDN'T MISSTATE THAT.

96
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,650
THE BIOGRAPHICAL SCREEN, DEVISED

97
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,384
UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

98
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,353
FOR THE REASONS I EXPLAINED WAS

99
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:36,454
CREATED BY A COMPANY THAT

100
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:39,424
ADMITTED THAT IT WAS NOT THE

101
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:40,958
RIGHT WAY TO FIND THE MOST

102
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,260
TALENTED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS

103
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,930
BUT THE FAA KEPT IT IN ANY WAY,

104
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,231
IS THAT CORRECT?

105
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,433
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

106
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,434
YOU DIDN'T MISSTATE IT.

107
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:51,102
YOU UNDERSTATED WHAT OCCURRED.

108
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:54,038
TO PUT THIS STORY IN A NUTSHELL,

109
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:56,741
IN LATE 2011, EARLY 2012,

110
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:00,745
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL BLACK

111
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:04,816
CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION HAD A

112
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:08,019
MEETING WITH THE RAINBOW PUSH

113
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:08,686
COALITION, JESSE JACKSON AND

114
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:12,957
SOME HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS, PART

115
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:13,725
OF THOSE MEETINGS BY THE WAY.

116
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:15,893
RIGHT AFTER THAT MEETING THEY

117
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:17,662
PUT AN IMMEDIATE HOLD ON HIRING.

118
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:18,196
THEY STOPPED HIRING.

119
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:20,832
THEY HAVE USED IT EXCUSES LIKE

120
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:22,433
SEQUESTERING, BUT THAT'S NOT

121
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,234
REALLY WHAT HAPPENED.

122
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,268
BASICALLY THEY SHUT DOWN THE

123
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:26,404
PROCESS EVEN THOUGH THE NATION

124
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:28,840
NEEDED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS.

125
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,640
LOTS WERE RETIRING.

126
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,475
THE SYSTEM WAS NEEDING NEW

127
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:31,142
TRAINEES TO GO THROUGH THE

128
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:33,277
SYSTEM BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO

129
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,580
GET THROUGH, BUT THEY DID THAT

130
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,214
CONSCIOUSLY.

131
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:40,952
THEN, THE PURGE OF THE 2600 OR

132
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:44,021
MORE QUALIFIED CTI STUDENTS IN

133
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,623
GRADUATE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE

134
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:46,958
COUNTRY INCLUDING A

135
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,960
TRADITIONALLY BLACK AND

136
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,228
DISADVANTAGED COLLEGES WERE

137
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:52,663
WIPED OFF A LIST AND BY THE WAY,

138
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:56,434
THAT LIST, THE 2600 FOLKS

139
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,669
INCLUDED A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF

140
00:03:58,669 --> 00:03:59,637
FEMALE AND MINORITY APPLICANTS

141
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:01,239
WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC

142
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:01,873
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS.

143
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:02,807
>> Tucker: PEOPLE WHO WERE

144
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,042
GOING TO SCHOOL FOR IT BASICALLY

145
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:05,910
GOING TO SCHOOL FOR IT BASICALL

146
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,277
BASICALLY.

147
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:07,311
>> PRIOR MILITARY EXPERIENCE IN

148
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:09,480
THE AREA, PILOTS, SOME OF THESE

149
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,214
INDIVIDUALS WERE MORE QUALIFIED

150
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:12,450
CERTAINLY THAN I WAS WHEN I

151
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:12,784
STARTED.

152
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:16,421
THEN AFTER THAT THEY DESIGNED A

153
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,156
TEST TO HER SPEAKING ABOUT, IF

154
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,858
BIOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT,

155
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:21,526
BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONNAIRE.

156
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:22,059
THIS ONE IS CALLED A

157
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,995
BIOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT THAT WAS

158
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:26,831
MADE FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AS

159
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:27,231
YOU STATED.

160
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:28,299
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE USED

161
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,268
THE WAY IT WAS ACTUALLY THE

162
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:30,968
CREATOR ACTUALLY NOTIFIED THEM

163
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:33,571
OF THAT.

164
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:35,740
IN EFFECT THAT TEST PUNISHED

165
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,409
PEOPLE WITH AVIATION KNOWLEDGE,

166
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,278
ANY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

167
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:41,145
EXPERIENCE, ANY AVIATION

168
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:41,813
EXPERIENCE, ANY SCIENCE

169
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:42,547
EXPERIENCE AND THEN THEY CAME

170
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:45,783
OUT AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD ONE

171
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:48,453
INDIVIDUAL, PUBLIC RELATIONS OF

172
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:49,153
THE SOUTHWEST REGION PUBLISH

173
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:50,621
THAT IT WAS FOR DIVERSITY.

174
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,355
THAT WAS PULLED BACK IMMEDIATELY

175
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:52,657
AND THEY STATED IT WAS FOR THE

176
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:55,259
BEST AND BRIGHTEST CANDIDATES.

177
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,028
>> Tucker: THIS IS SO ROTTEN

178
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:58,029
AND CORRUPT.

179
00:04:58,029 --> 00:04:59,130
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO

180
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,131
LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE YOU

181
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:02,867
CAN'T TRUST AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

182
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,469
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DOGMATICALLY

183
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:05,436
IDEOLOGICAL THAT THEY ARE

184
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:06,637
INTENTIONALLY SEEKING THE WORST

185
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:07,038
CANDIDATES.

186
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:07,438
IT'S INSANE.

187
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:09,674
VERY QUICKLY, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE

188
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:12,677
UNIONS AND ALL THE PILOTS

189
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:13,344
GROUPS, PRIVATE COMMERCIAL

190
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:14,045
PILOTS GROUPS.

191
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,446
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE IN

192
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:16,481
AVIATION WORLD WHO KNEW THIS WAS

193
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,649
GOING ON, WHY DID NOBODY SAY

194
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:19,851
ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

195
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,085
>> I THINK CERTAIN GROUPS TO TRY

196
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:22,987
TO SAY SOMETHING BUT QUITE

197
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:23,654
FRANKLY THERE WASN'T ENOUGH

198
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:26,958
PRESS COVERAGE ON IT AND BECAUSE

199
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,025
OF OTHER POLITICAL REASONS IT

200
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,627
DIDN'T COME TO THE FOREFRONT.

201
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:30,394
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS AFTER THE

202
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:33,898
STUDENTS WERE PURGED, THE FAA

203
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:34,699
LITERALLY KNEW THAT THERE WERE

204
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,868
INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN CHEATING

205
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,636
TO PASS THE NEW BIOGRAPHICAL

206
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:40,438
ASSESSMENT, SO THEY WIPED THE

207
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:41,639
STUDENTS OFF THE LIST, THEY

208
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,540
ALLOWED A GROUP TO THEN ENGAGE

209
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,077
IN INTENTIONAL TREATING, GAVE

210
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:47,478
BASICALLY THE SUBGROUP, THE

211
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:50,848
BLACK COALITION OF AVIATION

212
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,049
EMPLOYEES, THE ANSWERS TO THE

213
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:52,683
TEST.

214
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:53,317
THAT'S AS BIG A STORY AS

215
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:55,119
ANYTHING ELSE.

216
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,120
>> Tucker: UNFORTUNATELY WE

217
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,854
ARE OUT OF TIME BUT THIS WILL

218
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:58,155
NOT BE THE LAST TIME WE ADDRESS

219
00:05:58,155 --> 00:05:58,456
THIS.

220
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:01,192
THIS IS A THREAT TO THE COUNTRY,

221
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:01,993
IT'S TOTALLY WRONG AND IT CAN

222
00:06:01,993 --> 00:00:00,000
ONLY HAPPEN IN SECRECY AND WE
