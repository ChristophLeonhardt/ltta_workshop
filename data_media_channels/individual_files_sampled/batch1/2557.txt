so we named our book extreme ownership and really that's a an attitude that we took a mentality that we had and that was taking complete ownership of everything that was in our world that was affecting our operations while we were overseas I think one of the best and worst examples of this was actually an operation that I was in charge of and things went really really bad tragically bad and when it was over we began the debrief and try and figure out what happened and who made mistakes there was a bunch of guys on the battlefield multiple different seal elements operating with US Army elements Iraqi army elements there was a whole lot of pieces in moving parts and eventually I realized and told everyone hey this is uh this is nobody's fault but mine when things go wrong you've got to take ownership of it that set an example for all of us and for those guys that were on that particular operation said no when your fault that was my fault I'm taking ownership of my little piece of it so that was a culture that was built into our task unit that sent the example and the attitude that we exhibited and it was a critical critical thing for our entire our entire deployment that certainly led to our success oftentimes when we work with different companies in the business world there are leaders who they don't want to take ownership of stuff because they think somehow it's going to make them look weaker or that people won't have respect for them if they say hey I made a mistake but everybody makes mistakes nobody is infallible no matter how experienced how confident you are as a leader when you take ownership and you stand up in front of your team and say this was we did not do what we needed to do or we failed our mission here or we have this major incident it happened and guess whose fault that is that's my fault everybody in the organization gains respect for that leader because he can admit those mistakes and that's critical because then instead of a culture of excuse making and blaming others you actually acknowledge and own those mistakes so that you can come up with a solution to overcome them and win
