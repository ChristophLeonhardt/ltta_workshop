I'm joined by california congressman democrat ted Lieu a member of the House Judiciary Committee thank you for being here congressman a busy night let me read to you from NBC report one witness asked about Trump's business interest in Moscow surmising afterward the Moller investigation may be focused now on business dealings during the campaign as well as what I mentioned at the top of the hour of focus on what Donald Trump knew about a potential criminal conspiracy involving the emails on 1 to 10 how big are these developments if if in your view true and and what do they mean to where the probe is headed in your view Thank You ru for your question I would rate it as an 8 the American people now know that special counsel Mueller's team is at a point where they asked a critical question what did Donald Trump know and when did he know it we already have been informed from George papadopolis that the Russians told him they had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails the question now is who else in the campaign knew that did Jerry Kirchner know that Donald Trump jr. know that the President himself know in terms of business interests we know that the president still refuses releases tax returns and he's given conflicting statements as to when he first met Putin and I imagine you are invoking the famous Nixon question on purpose absolutely this has all the markings of Watergate where you have a person acting not only to obstruct an investigation but also taking actions that are inconsistent with what and per innocent person would do so let's for context remember that as we sit here today the president still has not imposed bipartisan congressional sanctions on Russia he still has refused to condemn the Kremlin or Vladimir Putin for their attack on American elections in 2016 and he still has refused to order the NSA or FBI to stop an attack in their future you think about this and it does change some of the benefit of the doubt that people may have afforded to what was a bizarre rookie unusual campaign and there are bizarre rookie unusual campaigns that do not end in a series of indictments so you can understand to some degree how things may have looked the time I want to play for you though a candidate who as a bizarre rookie seemed obsessed with WikiLeaks he wasn't interested in foreign policy he wasn't interested in transparency organizations in general and yet WikiLeaks for him which we now know his under part of the criminal probe was a priority take a look well I love reading those WikiLeaks did you see another one another one came in today this WikiLeaks it's like a treasure trove out today WikiLeaks just came out with a new one this just came out WikiLeaks of course she didn't know that there was a thing called WikiLeaks right they got it all down folks WikiLeaks WikiLeaks how does that look to you now right it looks really suspicious and just because Donald Trump was so public and brazen about some of his statements doesn't mean it's not illegal if it turns out that he had advanced knowledge that the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails and he helped you strategically amplify the release of those emails then that is collusion otherwise known as conspiracy hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
