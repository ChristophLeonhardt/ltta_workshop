1
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,340
My life was changed by coming to Fiji

2
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,580
and I fell so in love with the people here

3
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,640
that I decided I want to have a
piece of this and I want to find a way

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,880
to bring people here.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,980
And then, you know, I
eventually bought the resort and then I

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,740
started building it into the top resort
in the country for the last 10 years

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,220
and top 10 in the South Pacific.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,020
How you guys doing?

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,120
Welcome!

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,300
Lomalagi — it's called "heaven" in Fijian.

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,020
Come on in.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,000
I bought this place when I was
29, so it's been 33 years.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,579
I like to make

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,400
something that feels like it's very
relaxed but you know the scale of things

15
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,800
is my scale size chairs as you've
probably noticed.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,300
Reporter: And what's your favorite spot in the home?

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,580
Tony: I'll show you one of them.

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,740
I'll show you a couple of them if you want.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,600
This is one of my favorite little hangout spots.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,140
Totally private, down by the water.

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,880
Come down here and meditate or read and so forth.

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
I actually have a set of stairs that go down under

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,060
the caves down to the beach, but the last
storm took that out and it took out the

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,220
other place I'm gonna take you that's been
my favorite, which is my upstairs bed

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,320
up on top of the building.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,940
You know, I love to hang out 
up here where you have these

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,579
unending views and I have a giant bed
that's here that's covered, that's an

28
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,480
outdoor bed, which is clearly disappeared.

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,040
It was ripped off — 
literally ripped out of the building.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,700
This is another hangout area that we really love.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,760
I got outdoor beds everywhere around the house
too, that the wife and I love.

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,120
I opened this up because I have 'fish balls.'

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,280
I have these golf balls 
that are full of fish food

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,560
and so we use these as holes here
and we come out knock balls here.

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,520
And then they dissolve in the ocean and
provide the food, so they're ecologically

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,260
sound but also the fish love it.

37
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,039
Just pop on the other side, 
just so you see it real quick.

38
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,539
I'll show you

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,660
My "extra skinny" bed (laughs)

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,460
Just you know, all the beautiful little touches.

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,780
There's a bathtub 
overlooking the ocean — like that.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,360
Reporter: When you got this property, was it
kind of a bargain back then

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,200
or did you have to fight for it? Like, this property itself.

44
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,420
Tony: The first 125 acres that

45
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,540
are part of this resort was a coconut
plantation and it was owned by a group

46
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,440
of professors from Scripps Oceanography.
This entire reef right here, they studied

47
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,470
it for like 14 years and found more
diverse life anywhere else they studied.

48
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,560
And they sold it to a couple travel
agents and they didn't have enough money

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,240
to finish it. $10 million was
one chunk and then another one was

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,230
another five but it was a giant stretch
in those days and then gradually as I

51
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,880
became more financially 
astute and strong

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,620
I was able to put more and more into it

53
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,740
Did you go up to the waterfall?

54
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,540
Reporter: Have
we gone to the waterfall?

55
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,540
No, we didn't make it to the waterfall

56
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,960
Tony: OK, we should run you up to the waterfall.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,820
Will you call them
and ask them if they've got —

58
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,840
my car's broken down, I think. 
I don't know if I fit in this car.

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,100
See if they've got somebody who can take us out to the waterfall real fast.

60
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,460
I love this.

61
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,920
Feels so good!

62
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,960
Bula!

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
Stop. Slow down, slow down.

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,020
Great job!

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,420
Great job! Really love what
you've done over here. It's looking

66
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,820
really beautiful. Thank you so much, Joe.
Take care, brother.

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,720
I'm sorry I didn't get to see you longer today.

68
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,220
Reporter: So you've really become like
an integral part of the community here?

69
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,080
Tony: Oh without a doubt.

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,560
They're my family 
on both sides.

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,840
They called me "Boss Levu," which means "Big Boss"

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,920
Reporter: You're 'Big Boss?' You're 'Big Boss' here in Fiji.

73
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,320
Tony: 'Cause this is Vanua Levu, right?

74
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,280
It's the big island, right?

75
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,740
Reporter: The big island. You're the 
"Big Boss" on the big island.

76
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,140
(Laughs) That's awesome.

77
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,820
Tony: "Are we on time? Am I late?

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,680
OK, we'll be ready to go in five minutes.

79
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,940
Time to say goodbye again. I'm so sorry
but I look forward to coming back home

80
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,920
to see all the family again. It's been a
beautiful, beautiful trip.

81
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Bula vinaka.

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:00:00,000
(Singing)
