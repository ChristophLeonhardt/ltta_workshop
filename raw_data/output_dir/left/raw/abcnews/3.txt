KAVANAUGH'S ALLEGED ALLEGATIONS 

85
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,726

00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,030
THINK HOW HE WAS GOING TO VOTE 

88
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,298

THOSE KEY SENATORS WHO WE DID 

96
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,249
NOT KNOW WHICH WAY SHE WOULD GO.

97
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,917
SHE'S A SENATOR FROM ALASKA.

98
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,519

QUOTE, WE'RE NOW IN A PLACE 

115
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,451
WHETHER OR NOT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

116
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,486
IS QUALIFIED IT'S ABOUT WHETHER 

117
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:15,955
OR NOT A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN A 

118
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,623
VICTIM AT SOME POINT IN HER LIFE

119
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,459
IS TO BE BELIEVED.

120
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,994
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT.

121
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:24,997
SENATOR MURKOWSKI'S NO VOTE IS 

122
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:25,498
SIGNIFICANT.

123
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,433
>> SHE MIGHT BE MAKING THIS 

124
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:27,867
VOTE.

125
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,035
SHE HAD BEEN UNDER TREMENDOUS 

126
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:36,142
PRESSURE FROM HER CONSTITUENTS.

127
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,710
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN 

128
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,945
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS DEBATE THAT

129
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,279
WE HAVE SEEN HERE ON THE HILL.

130
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,782
THE LEVEL OF INTERACTION BETWEEN

131
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,984
PROTESTERS AND THESE KEY 

132
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:45,985
UNDECIDED VOTES.

THESE KEY SWING VOTES HAS BEEN 

134
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:48,988
REALLY SOMETHING TO WATCH.

135
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:49,488
SOMETHING TREMENDOUS.

136
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,357
WE HAVE SEEN PROTESTERS NOT JUST

137
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,626

138
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,461

LISA MURKOWSKI UNDER TREMENDOUS 

145
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,007
PRESSURE AND NOW WE KNOW SHE'S 

146
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,778
VOTING "NO" TO ADVANCE THIS 

147
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,512
DEBATE.

THIS MORNING IN THE CLOTURE 

151
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,627
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN A "NO" 

152
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:31,731
VOTE IN THE CONFIRMATION.

153
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:38,371
>> THIS IS A PROCEDURAL VOTE.

154
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,106
HOW SENATORS VOTE TODAY DOESN'T 

155
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:42,675
NECESSARILY DIRECT HOW THEY'LL 

156
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,911
VOTE ON FINAL PASSAGE.

157
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,411
IF THIS VOTE GOES THROUGH, 

158
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:48,481
THEY'LL LIKELY VOTE ON FINAL 

159
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,483
PASSAGE SOME TIME TOMORROW 

160
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:50,750

VOTE.

164
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,890
SHE COULD TECHNICALLY VOTE NO 

165
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,194
TOMORROW BUT THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY

166
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,997
GIVEN SOME OF THE SIGNS WE HAVE 

167
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,732
SEEN COMING FROM HER.

168
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,267
SHE THOUGHT THAT THE FBI 

169
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,602
INVESTIGATION WAS THOROUGH.

170
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,170
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

171
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,973
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY LATER THIS 

172
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,108

00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,289
ON WHAT IT IS WE'RE WITNESSING.

189
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,024
WE KNOW THAT THE DEMOCRATIC 

190
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,793
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, ONE OF THE 

191
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:08,561
UNDECIDES GOING INTO THIS 

192
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:18,004
MORNING VOTING "YES" TO THIS 

193
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:18,337
CLOTURE VOTE.

194
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,339
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON 

195
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,707
SENATOR MANCHIN.

196
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,142
HE COMES FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

197
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,276
WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP WON 

198
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,613
HANDILY IN THE 2016 ELECTION.

199
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,915
MR. MAMPLIN IS A DEMOCRAT AND 

200
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,918
HAS BEEN DELIBERATING.

201
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,620
AND HAD BEEN IN THE SECURE ROOM 

202
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,090
WHERE THE FINDINGS OF THE FBI 

203
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,258
INVESTIGATION ARE, UNDER LOCK 

204
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:39,959
AND KEY.

205
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,360
HE SAID THAT HE WAS UNDECIDED.

206
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,929
HE WANTED TO LOOK AT THE 

207
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,497
FINDINGS OF THAT REPORT AGAIN, 

208
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:47,700
BEFORE HEADING INTO THIS ROOM TO

209
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,900
VOTE. 

210
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,167
>> MR. DONNELLY. 

211
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,870
>> COKIE ROBERTS WATCHING THIS 

212
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,671
UNFOLD THIS MORNING.

213
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,305
THIS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM 

214
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:54,774
WHAT WE NORMALLY SEE. 

215
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,542
>> DAVID, WHEN SENATORS TAKE A 

216
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,310
VOTE THEY'RE WANDERING ON AND 

217
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,111
OFF THE FLOOR.

218
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,980
THEY'RE TALKING TO EACH OTHER.

219
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,315
ONLY THREE, FOUR ON THE FLOOR AT

220
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:03,816
THE SAME TIME.

221
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,551
HERE, THEY'RE SITTING IN THEIR 

222
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,986
SEATS.

223
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,020
LISTENING.

224
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,521
SERIOUS.

225
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,121
CALM.

226
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,222
STANDING TO VOTE.

227
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:13,058
THIS IS A VERY, VERY SERIOUS 

228
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,893
PROCEEDING AND THEY KNOW IT AND 

229
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,462
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE BEHAVING IN 

230
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,062
THIS FASHION.

231
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:18,764
THEY'RE ALL THERE AND THEY'RE 

232
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,600
TAKING THIS QUITE RIOUSLY.

233
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,902
NORMALLY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, 

234
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,271
WITH THE CLOTURE VOTE, TO VOTE 

235
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:29,475
TO END DEBATE, IF YOU VOTE "YES"

236
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,712
ON CLOTURE, IT MEANS TAKING IT 

237
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,615
TO THE NEXT STEP.

238
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,616
IF YOU VOTE "NO" ON CLOSURE, 

239
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,184
YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T WANT TO 

240
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:41,953
TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP.

241
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:44,857
IT'S VERY, VERY UNLIKELY THAT 

242
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,993
YOU WOULD THEN VOTE FOR THE 

243
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:47,760
NOMINEE.

244
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,396
THE FACT THAT LISA MURKOWSKI HAS

245
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,164
VOTED "NO" IS HIGHLY 

246
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:52,765
SIGNIFICANT.

247
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,334
THE FACT THAT JOE MANCHIN AND 

248
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:59,104
SUE COLLINS VOTED "YES" IS ALSO 

249
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:00,640
SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT QUITE AS 

250
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:00,973
SIGNIFICANT. 

251
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,441
>> WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE 

252
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,810
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE 50 VOTES 

253
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,113
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR FOR 

254
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:07,380
CLOSURE.

255
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,948
BUT AS COKIE JUST MENTIONED, 

256
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:11,684
SOMETIMES THIS INITIAL VOTE OF 

257
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,685
CLOSURE IS AN INDICATOR OF WHAT 

258
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:14,720
TO COME.

259
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,855
FOR LISA MURKOWSKI, COKIE, THIS 

260
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:20,126
WAS SIGNIFICANT THAT SHE WAS A 

261
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,960
"NO" VOTE THIS MORNING AND 

262
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,099
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, A "YES" 

263
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:27,433
VOTE.

264
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:31,870
>> HE COULD BE THE SENATOR TO 

265
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,939
BRING JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO THE 

266
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,274
SUPREME COURT.

267
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,044
LISA MURKOWSKI IS NOT UP THIS 

268
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:38,611
YEAR.

269
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,646
SHE KNOWS HOW TO WORK ALASKA.

270
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,815
SHE LOST HER PRIMARY THE LAST 

271
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,450
TIME SHE RAN.

272
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,985
THEN, RAN AS A WRITE-IN 

273
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:47,553
CANDIDATE.

274
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,790
SHE'S NOT AS FEARFUL OF THE 

275
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,427
REPUBLICAN BASE AS SOME OF THE 

276
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:56,762
OTHERS ARE.

277
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,796
SUSSAN COLLINS I'M TOLD, IF SHE 

278
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,431
VOTES AGAINST KAVANAUGH SHE'S 

279
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:03,335
LIKELY NOT TO BE NOMINATED AGAIN

280
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:03,969
BY REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE OF 

281
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:13,646
MAINE.

282
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,147
>> JON KARL WATCHING WITH US 

283
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,148
THIS MORNING.

284
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,583
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 

285
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:17,916
CORRESPONDENT.

286
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:23,022
WHAT ARE WE TO READ INTO SENATOR

287
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,890
SUSAN COLLINS, YES TO CLOSURE 

288
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,025
BUT APPEAR LATER ON THIS 

289
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,994
AFTERNOON AND DELIVER A SPEECH 

290
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:29,995
WHAT HER FINAL DECISION WILL BE.

291
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:32,765
>> I THINK IT'S MERELY 

292
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,301
IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THAT SUSAN

293
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,369
COLLINS WOULD VOTE YES ON THIS 

294
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,071
THE CRITICAL VOTE AND THEN 

295
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,939
CHANGE HER MIND OR VOTE 

296
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,975
DIFFERENTLY ON THE FINAL VOTE.

297
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,377
SHE HAS HER BIG SPEECH AT 3:00, 

298
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:48,080
THE MOST IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF HER

299
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,349
SAYING THAT SHE'S NOT ANNOUNCING

300
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,319
YET HOW SHE'LL VOTE ON THE FINAL

301
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:53,519
VOTE.

302
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,254
I THINK IT'S A WAY TO MAKE SURE 

303
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,690
THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT DRAMA 

304
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,125
LEFT AND ATTENTION.

305
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,194
WE'LL ALL BE WATCHING HER 

306
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:02,862
SPEECH.

307
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,997
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT 

308
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,700
MARY BRUCE HAS SAID ABOUT ALL OF

309
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,601
COLLINS' COMMENTS.

310
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,802
NOW, THIS VOTE.

311
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,403
THEY ALL POINT IN THE DIRECTION 

312
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:15,441
OF HER VOTING "YES" ON THE FINAL

313
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:15,908
CONFIRMATION.

314
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,676
DAVID, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS WE 

315
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:22,014
HAVE SEEN THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

316
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,648
WILL BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

317
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,483
>> JON KARL WATCHING THIS 

318
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:24,716
MORNING.

319
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,352
AND AGAIN, THAT KEY AND CRUCIAL 

320
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,621
VOTE AS WE WERE SAYING, SENATOR 

321
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,957
JOE MANCHIN, DEMOCRAT OF WEST 

322
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,093
VIRGINIA, THIS IS NOT HIS FINAL 

323
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:34,593
VOTE.

324
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,428
HE DID VOTE "YES" THIS MORNING 

325
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,665
TO END THE DEBATE TO END THE 

326
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,900
DEBATE OF WHETHER BRETT 

327
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,635
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO

328
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:45,504
THE SUPREME COURT.

329
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,607
SOME VERY STRONG INDICATORS IT 

330
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,042
LOOKS LIKE JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL 

331
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,243
BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT 

332
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:51,577
JUSTICE.

333
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,980
IF THAT DOES HAPPEN, THE SWING 

334
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,650
SEAT ON THE SUPREME COURT WILL 

335
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,620
SHIFT TO MORE 

336
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,688
CONSERVATIVE-LEANING FOR 

337
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,222
GENERATIONS.

338
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:03,889
HISTORIC VOTE.

339
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,490
WE'RE WATCHING THE FIRST ROUND 

340
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,358
OF THIS.

341
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,794
IT'S NO GUARANTEE OF WHAT COULD 

342
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,429
COME AS EARLY AS TOMORROW.

343
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,197
SOME STRONG INDICATORS THAT 

344
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,100
WE'RE WITNESSING THIS MORNING IS

345
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,037
VERY POSITIVE FOR BOTH BRETT 

346
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:19,638
KAVANAUGH AND FOR PRESIDENT 

347
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,141
TRUMP AND THE WHITE HOUSE.

348
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,710
I WANT TO BRING IN TERRY MORAN 

349
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,745
WHO HAS COVERED THE SUPREME 

350
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,448
COURT FOR US FOR YEARS.

351
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,650
IT'S VERY RARE PERHAPS WE 

352
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,719
HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN OUR 

353
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,687
LIFETIME, A RETIRED SUPREME 

354
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,155
COURT JUSTICE WEIGHS IN ON THE 

355
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:40,159
EVE OF THIS CLOSURE VOTE.

356
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,796
JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEPHENS.

357
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,064
HE DID REVEAL THAT HE CHANGED 

358
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:47,766
HIS VIEWS FOR REASONS THAT HAD 

359
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,237
NO RELATIONSHIP TO BRETT 

360
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,938
KAVANAUGH'S INTELLECTUAL 

361
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,205
ABILITY.

362
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,773
HE REVEALED IN THE LAST 24 

363
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,808
HOURS, QUOTE, I FEEL HIS 

364
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,410
PERFORMANCE THE HEARINGS 

365
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,812
ULTIMATELY CHANGED MY MIND AND 

366
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,582
ULTIMATELY DISQUALIFIED HIM FROM

367
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,416
THE SUPREME COURT 

368
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,985
>> JOHN PAUL STEPHENS, LONGTIME 

369
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,088
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT FORD, A 

370
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,189
LIFELONG REPUBLICAN.

371
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,357
VOTED LIBERAL.

372
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,791
BUT WAS SEEN ON THIS COURT BY 

373
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,828
ALL OF THE OTHER MEMBERS AS VERY

374
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,263
CORDIAL, VERY CORRECT IN THE WAY

375
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:21,633
HE APPROACHED JUSTICE'S DUTIES.

376
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:26,505
FOR HIM TO COME FORWARD ON JUDGE

377
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,073
KAVANAUGH, KNOWN TO THESE 

378
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,876
JUSTICES, A RISING STAR FOR A 

379
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,010
GENERATION AMONG CONSERVATIVE 

380
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,046
LAWYERS TO COME OUT AND SAY HIS 

381
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,414
PERFORMANCE AT THE HEARING 

382
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,784
CHANGED MY MIND AND TO SAY IT 

383
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:50,362
PUBLICLY WAS A REBUKE.

384
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:55,434
>> ON THIS VOTE, THE AYES ARE 

385
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:55,634
51.

386
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,636
THE NOs ARE 49.

387
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,806
THE MOTION IS AGREED TO. 

388
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,975
>> WE JUST HEARD THE GAVEL THERE

389
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:03,943
MOMENTS AGO.

390
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,745
THEY HAVE NOW VOTED TO END 

391
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,048
DEBATE INTO NOMINEE JUDGE BRETT 

392
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:09,915
KAVANAUGH.

393
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,050
THIS NOW SETS THINGS IN MOTION 

394
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,054
FOR A HISTORIC VOTE AS EARLY AS 

395
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:15,321
TOMORROW.

396
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,590
WHICH COULD LEAD TO BRETT 

397
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,725
KAVANAUGH BECOMING THE NEXT 

398
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,826
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

399
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,227
VERY KEY VOTE THIS MORNING.

400
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:25,163
NOT A GUARANTEE OF WHICH WAY 

401
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:28,734
HE'LL GO THIS WEEK.

402
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,370
HE SAID THIS MORNING, HE WAS NOT

403
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,906
READY, HE WAS UNDECIDED AND THAT

404
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,808
HE HEADED BACK INTO THAT ROOM 

405
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,043
WHERE THE FINDINGS OF THIS FBI 

406
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,378
INVESTIGATION STILL REMAIN 

407
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:39,744
LOCKED UP. 

408
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,580
>> HE ACTUALLY SAID HE WAS GOING

409
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,082
TO REMAIN UNDECIDED UNTIL HE 

410
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:45,985
WALKED INTO THE CHAMBER FOR THAT

411
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:46,585
VOTE.

412
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,188
ADDING SOME DRAMA, HE DIDN'T 

413
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,456
VOTE WHEN HIS NAME WAS FIRST 

414
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:50,689
CALLED.

415
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,057
ONE OF THE FINAL SENATORS TO 

416
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,492
CAST THEIR VOTE.

417
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,461
AND WHAT MANCHIN DOES -- FIRST 

418
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,863
OF ALL, IF HE VOTED NO, THIS 

419
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,765
STILL WOULD HAVE PASSED.

420
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,434
THEY WOULD HAVE NEEDED THE 

421
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,536
TIE-BREAKING VOTE BY THE VICE 

422
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:04,870
PRESIDENT.

423
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,040
THIS MAKES THIS NOT QUITE A 

424
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,680
TOTAL PARTISAN VOTE.

425
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,013
S

426
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:17,249
WITHOUT THAT SINGLE VOTE, A 

427
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,450
SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA, A 

428
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,353
STATE THAT DONALD TRUMP WON IN A

429
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,788
LANDSLIDE, WITHOUT THAT SINGLE 

430
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,857
VOTE WE WOULD SEE HERE, WE WOULD

431
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,859
BE HEADED TOWARDS THE FIRST 

432
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,761
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE TO BE 

433
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,563
CONFIRMED STRICTLY ON PARTY 

434
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,598
LINES.

435
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,566
THIS IS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU 

436
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,501
CAN GET.

437
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,770
SINGLE VOTE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

438
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,672
THIS IS SUCH A BREAK FROM 

439
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:41,440
PRECEDENT.

440
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,846
NEIL GORSUCH HAD THREE DEMOCRAT 

441
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,380
VOTES.

442
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,716
REMEMBER, IT'S BEEN THROUGHOUT 

443
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,518
HISTORY, SUPREME COURT NOMINEES 

444
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,821
HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY WIDE 

445
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,490
BIPARTISAN MARGINS.

446
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,561
RUTH BADER GINSBURG WON 

447
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,896
CONFIRMATION WITH ONLY THREE 

448
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:09,134
SENATORS VOTING NO.

449
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,470
ANTONIN SCALIA WAS CONFIRMED TO 

450
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,339
THE SUPREME COURT, 98-0.

451
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,575
HERE WE ARE AT A STATE 

452
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,442
REFLECTING THE DIVIDE, THE 

453
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:20,846
POLITICAL DIVIDE IN OUR COUNTRY,

454
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,714
REFLECTING WHAT WE SAW WITH 

455
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:25,917
THESE HEARINGS, WE HAVE A 

456
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,253
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE HEADED 

457
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,856
TOWARDS WHAT WILL BY WOULD 

458
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,059
ARGUE, AN ALMOST CERTAIN 

459
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,428
CONFIRMATION, WITH A SINGLE VOTE

460
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,896
FROM THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTY.

461
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,698
JUST A SINGLE VOTE.

462
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,833
OTHERWISE, PARTY LINE.

463
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,268
>> PARTY LINE WITH THE IN 

464
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,036
ADDITION OF ONE DEMOCRAT, JOE 

465
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:46,371
MANCHIN BEING A SIGNIFICANT AND 

466
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:46,905
KEY VOTE.

467
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,740
THEY DID NOT NEED THE VICE 

468
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,908
PRESIDENT TO PUT THEM OVER THE 

469
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,110
TOP IN THIS CASE.

470
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,778
JOE MAMPBLIN FROM WEST VIRGINIA,

471
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,813
A DEMOCRAT, OBVIOUSLY HELPING 

472
00:16:54,813 --> 00:17:01,120
THEM TO GET THE 51 VOTES THEY 

473
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,287
NEEDED.

474
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:02,620
S

475
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,156
SO MUCH OF THIS WE HAVEN'T SEEN 

476
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,391
BEFORE LEADING UP TO THE NEXT 

477
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,392
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

478
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,828
WE SAY MARY BRUCE, THIS NOMINEE 

479
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,298
DO A SITDOWN INTERVIEW WITH HIS 

480
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:13,498
WIFE.

481
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:16,067
WE SAW THE OP-ED IN THE WALL 

482
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,036
STREET JOURNAL IN THE 11th HOUR,

483
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,738
TALKING ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT 

484
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,071
AND SUGGESTING THAT PERHAPS HE 

485
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:23,675
WAS TOO EMOTIONAL AT TIMES AND 

486
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,877
THAT OP-ED, THOUGH, IN A 

487
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,712
NATIONAL NEWSPAPER WAS LIKELY 

488
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,347
GEARS STRAIGHT TO THOSE FOUR 

489
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:31,349
SENATORS WHO WERE UNDECIDED.

490
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:32,884
WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN DELIBERATING

491
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,519
THIS ISSUE OF TEMPERAMENT THAT 

492
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,888
WAS RAISED.

493
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,889
IN ADDITION TO THESE ALLEGATIONS

494
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,624
THAT WERE RAISED AGAINST HIM BY 

495
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,460
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.

496
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,428
THEN THE DEBATE OVER 

497
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:46,231
TEMPERAMENT.

498
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,501
HOW HE DISPLAYED HIMSELF.

499
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,637
YOU CAN SEE THE OP-ED.

500
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,773
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL 

501
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,708
AT TIMES.

502
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,546
I KNOW THAT MY TONE WAS SHARP.

503
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,980
>> REMARKABLE WAY TO HAVE A 

504
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,314
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE DELIVER 

505
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,884
HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT HERE AND IT

506
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,387
WAS NOT JUST TO THE AMERICAN 

507
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:08,787
PUBLIC.

508
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,523
VERY CLEAR AIMED AT THOSE 

509
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,859
UNDECIDED KEY SWING VOTES.

510
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,661
KAVANAUGH HITTING ON SOME OF 

511
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:19,231
THOSE CONCERNS.

512
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,400
HIS TONE, HIS CONCERNS ABOUT HIS

513
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,901
PARTISAN ATTACKS ON HIS 

514
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,237
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

515
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,638
KAVANAUGH LAYING OUT IN THAT 

516
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,206
OP-ED TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF 

517
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,408
AND HIS TESTIMONY AND 

518
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:32,177
INTERESTINGLY MAKING THE 

519
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:35,013
ADMISSION THAT HE SAID THINGS 

520
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:38,349
THAT SHE -- HE SHOULD NOT HAVE 

521
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:42,955
SAID.

522
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,290
WHETHER THEY PLAYED ANY ROLE IN 

523
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,125
THEIR DECISIONMAKING HERE, THOSE

524
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,092
FOUR UNDECIDED.

525
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:49,995
THREE OF THEM SENATOR COLLINS, 

526
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,298
SENATOR FLAKE, SENATOR MANCHIN, 

527
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,201
NOW BEING A YES TO SUPPORT HIS 

528
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:56,534
CONFIRMATION.

529
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,470
IF THEY VOTE TOMORROW ON FINAL 

530
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,671
PASSAGE, JUDGE KAVANAUGH OF 

531
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,805
COURSE WILL BE CONFIRMED. 

532
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,874
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

533
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:08,780
IF IT'S AN INDICATOR OF WHAT'S 

534
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,383
TO COME TOMORROW, HE'LL BE THE 

535
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:16,555
NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

536
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:22,961
THE ONLY ONE VOTTO VOTE NO WAS 

537
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:28,233
SENATOR MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA.

538
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:32,671
EXTREMELY DIVIDED ON THIS CHOICE

539
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,872
FOR THE SUPREME COURT.

540
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,740
WE DID SAY, MARY WAS TALKING 

541
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,310
ABOUT THIS MOMENTS AGO, IN THAT 

542
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,712
OP-ED, HE WAS TALKING DIRECTLY 

543
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,247
TO THESE SENATORS, IN DOING SO 

544
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,549
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE

545
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:46,018
TEMPERAMENT HE DISPLAYED IN 

546
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,887
FRONT OF THAT SENATE JUDICIARY 

547
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,088
COMMITTEE A WEEK AGO.

548
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,890
ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR BACK IN HIS 

549
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,592
COLLEGE DAYS AND DURING HIS HIGH

550
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,459
SCHOOL YEARS.

551
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:58,363
WE SAW THAT MOMENT WHERE SENATOR

552
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,533
KLOBUCHAR ASKED HIM ABOUT 

553
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:06,204
WHETHER HE HAD EVER BLACKOUT AND

554
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,738
HE TURNED THE QUESTION AROUND 

555
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:10,275
AND SAID, I DON'T KNOW, HAVE 

556
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,977
YOU, SENATOR?

557
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,878
A MOMENT THAT PLAYED AGAIN AND 

558
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,480
AGAIN ON CABLE NEWS AND NEWS 

559
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,915
REPORT THAT FOLLOWED.

560
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,817
BROUGHT UP THIS QUESTION OF 

561
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:19,351
TEMPERAMENT.

562
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,887
TERRY, THIS WAS THE QUOTE IN HIS

563
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,454
OPENING STATEMENT.

564
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,124
THIS WAS NOT THE REACTION TO A 

565
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,026
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF HIM.

566
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,395
HE SAID THIS TWO-WEEK EFFORT HAS

567
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,965
BEEN CALCULATED POLITICAL HIT 

568
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,568
WITH APPARENT PENT-UP ANGER WITH

569
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,371
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

570
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,374
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE 

571
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:42,641
CLINTONS.

572
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,142
AND YOU'RE A VETERAN OF THE 

573
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:44,476
COURT.

574
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,013
HAVE YOU HEARD A NOMINEE TALK IN

575
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,916
SUCH SHARP, PARTISAN TERMS.

576
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,085
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

577
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,720
AN IMPORTANT POINT.

578
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,388
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A WRITER.

579
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:06,832
HE WRITES AS A JUDGE.

580
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,000
NEVER AS PARTISAN AS WHAT 

581
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,136
KAVANAUGH SAID THERE.

582
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,370
WHAT JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEPHENS 

583
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,271
WAS REMARKING ON.

584
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,840
THE ANGER AND THE TEARS, THOSE 

585
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,575
ARE UNDERSTANDABLE EMOTIONS FOR 

586
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,744
A MAN WHO WAS SAYING HE WAS 

587
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,379
FALSELY ACCUSED IN FRONT OF HIS 

588
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,714
FAMILY AND THE WORLD AND THAT 

589
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:26,585
WAS INCREDIBLY PAINFUL.

590
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,286
ANGER AND TEARS WERE A NATURAL 

591
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,489
REACTION TO THAT.

592
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,490
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS A LOYAL, 

593
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,526
PARTISAN REPUBLICAN LAWYER FOR 

594
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,028
KEN STARR IN THE FLORIDA 

595
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:39,331
ELECTION CONTEST AND THE 

596
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,498
BUSH/GORE ELECTION IN THE BUSH 

597
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:41,032
WHITE HOUSE.

598
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:42,500
I THINK PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED 

599
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,968
ABOUT WHAT WAS REVEALED ABOUT 

600
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:46,438
HIS PARTISANSHIP.

601
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,039
NOT AS MUCH ABOUT THE EMOTIONS. 

602
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,074
>> TERRY MORAN STAY WITH US. 

603
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:53,144
>>> WE'RE ON THE AIR WITH 

604
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,746
BREAKING NEWS OF THE CRUCIAL 

605
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,114
VOTE INVOLVING SUPREME COURT 

606
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,383
NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH.

607
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:02,119
11:00 A.M. EASTERN.

608
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,054
MOMENT AGO ON THE SENATE FLOOR, 

609
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:06,024
THIS MOMENT WAS CRUCIAL IN 

610
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,092
PUSHING BRETT KAVANAUGH CLOSER 

611
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,962
TO THAT POST ON THE SUPREME 

612
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:11,329
COURT.

613
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:11,997
>> THANK YOU.

614
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,033
ON THIS VOTE, THE AYES ARE 51.

615
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:18,570
THE NOES ARE 49.

616
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,974
THE MOTION IS AGREED TO.

617
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,910
>> YOU HEARD THE GAVEL THERE.

618
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,212
JUST MOMENTS AGO.

619
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,314
51 VOTES TO NOW LIMIT THIS 

620
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:29,915
DEBATE.

621
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,516
OF COURSE, SENATORS CAN CHANGE 

622
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,619
THEIR VOTE BETWEEN TODAY AND THE

623
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,154
FINAL VOTE WHICH COULD COME AS 

624
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,690
EARLY AS TOMORROW.

625
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,526
IT'S RARE THAT THAT ACTUALLY 

626
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:41,860
HAPPENS.

627
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,928
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, A DEMOCRAT 

628
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:46,698
FROM WEST VIRGINIA, HELPING THEM

629
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,667
GET THOSE 51 VOTES.

630
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:53,137
THE ONLY DEMOCRAT TO VOTE "YES" 

631
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:57,542
TO PUSH THIS NOMINEE FORWARD TO 

632
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,410
THE SUPREME COURT.

633
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,879
OF THE FOUR UNDECIDED SENATORS 

634
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,214
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING, ONLY ONE 

635
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:04,149
VOTED NO.

636
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,551
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI, 

637
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:12,958
REPUBLICAN SENATOR OF ALASKA WHO

638
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,693
VOTED NO.

639
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,962
SHE HAS HEARD FROM SURVIVORS OF 

640
00:23:17,962 --> 00:23:18,964
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

641
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,800
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT SHE MET 

642
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,502
WITH SOME IN HER OFFICE JUST 

643
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:23,769
YESTERDAY.

644
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,737
SO MANY OF THOSE POIGNANT 

645
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,104
MOMENTS.

646
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,973
WE SAW JEFF FLAKE IN THE 

647
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:30,441
ELEVATOR JUST BEFORE THE 

648
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:32,878
HEARINGS LAST WEEK.

649
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,979
WHERE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL 

650
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:36,982
ASSAULT APPROACHED HIM IN THE 

651
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,050
ELEVATOR, ONE OF THE WOMEN 

652
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,753
SAYING, LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M 

653
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,888
TALKING WITH YOU.

654
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,291
IT'S WIDELY BELIEVED THAT LED 

655
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,593
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE AND HIS 

656
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,195
COLLEAGUES ON THE SENATE 

657
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:52,864
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HE THEN 

658
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,232
JOINED DEMOCRATS IN PUSHING FOR 

659
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,768
THIS ONE-WEEK PAUSE.

660
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,405
HE AND SENATOR CHRIS COONS 

661
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,439
SUGGESTING THAT.

662
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,508
JEFF FLAKE GOING ALONG WITH THAT

663
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,276
IDEA.

664
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:04,876
REALLY CHANGED THE COURSE OF 

665
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:08,113
THIS WHOLE PROCESS.

666
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,213
MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE COME OUT 

667
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:11,983
TO SAY THAT THEY BELIEVE THE FBI

668
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,284
INVESTIGATION NOT ONLY WAS 

669
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:15,019
THOROUGH AND COMPLETE BUT DID 

670
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:18,356
NOT OFFER ANY CORROBORATING 

671
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,425
EVIDENCE TO DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY

672
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,058
FORD'S TESTIMONY.

673
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:22,527
THE ARGUMENT FROM DEMOCRATS, 

674
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,462
SOME CALLING THIS A SHAM, SAYING

675
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,664
MANY OF THE NAMES THAT WERE PUT 

676
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:29,100
FORWARD WHO HAVE CORROBORATED 

677
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,302
DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY AND THE 

678
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:34,071
TESTIMONY OF DEBBIE RAMIREZ, SHE

679
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:37,075
TALKED WITH THE FBI, MANY OF THE

680
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,676
NAMES PUT FORWARD THAT COULD 

681
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:41,079
BACK UP THEIR STORIES WERE 

682
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,948
SIMPLY NOT REACHED OUT BY THE 

683
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:43,281
FBI.

684
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,549
ULTIMATELY QUESTIONS ABOUT 

685
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,617
WHETHER OR NOT THE WHITE HOUSE 

686
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,085
CONTROLLED WHO THEY COULD TALK 

687
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,687
TO AND WHY THIS WAS TEN OR SO 

688
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:51,723
PEOPLE WHO WERE REACHED BY THE 

689
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,092
FBI AND WHY THAT NUMBER WASN'T 

690
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,026
GREATER THAN THAT.

691
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,894
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING DEBATED 

692
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:58,396
FOR SOME TIME TO COME.

693
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,932
THE TWEET THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF

694
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,567
THE SCREEN, VERY PROUD OF THE 

695
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,769
U.S. SENATE FOR VOTING "YES" TO 

696
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,005
ADVANCE THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE 

697
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,740
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

698
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,408
DEBATE CAN STILL CONTINUE BUT 

699
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,144
THIS CERTAINLY MINIMIZES THIS.

700
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,846
THE FINAL VOTE COULD COME AS 

701
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,947
EARLY AS TOMORROW.

702
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,249
STRONG INDICATORS TODAY, THIS 

703
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:20,185
VERY WELL MEANS THAT JUDGE BRETT

704
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,953
KAVANAUGH COULD BE THE NEXT 

705
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:22,553
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

706
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:24,555
IT WOULD BE AN HISTORIC SHIFT 

707
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:25,824
FOR THE COURT.

708
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,995
HE WOULD OCCUPY THAT SWING SEAT.

709
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,999
THE COURT WOULD THEN LEAN 

710
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:34,899
CONSERVATIVE LIKELY FOR 

711
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,034
GENERATIONS TO COME.

712
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,202
THE OTHER QUESTION HERE, COKIE, 

713
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:41,105
IS ABOUT HOW WOMEN AROUND THIS 

714
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,373
COUNTRY ARE SEEING THIS VOTE 

715
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:44,175
HERE THIS MORNING, NOT JUST 

716
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,178
WOMEN, MEN, MANY MEN WHO HAVE 

717
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,014
SURVIVED SEXUAL ASSAULT AS WELL.

718
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,116
THE WOMEN WHO CAME TO THE 

719
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:51,349
CAPITOL.

720
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,151
THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER THIS 

721
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,987
COUNTRY TO TRY AND INFLUENCE 

722
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,556
SOME OF THOSE SENATORS WHO WERE 

723
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:58,823
UNDECIDED.

724
00:25:58,823 --> 00:25:59,958
SOME OF THOSE FOUR.

725
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:04,262
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY'RE 

726
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,797
RECEIVING THIS?

727
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,667
>> VERY STARK AND EMOTIONAL 

728
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,101
REACTIONS TO THIS.

729
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,671
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN SEEING

730
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,307
ANY WAY EVEN BEFORE THIS VERY 

731
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:17,642
CONTENTIOUS HEARING, A BIG GAP 

732
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,311
BETWEEN THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE 

733
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,079
REACTING TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

734
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,816
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT AS BIG AS 

735
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,751
THE PARTISAN GAP WITH 

736
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,520
REPUBLICANS SUPPORTING HIM AND 

737
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,990
THE DEMOCRATS NOT SUPPORTING 

738
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,156
HIM.

739
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:33,725
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A REACTION 

740
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,193
TO THIS.

741
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,862
IT'S NOT FAIR FOR JUDGE 

742
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:38,963
KAVANAUGH TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF 

743
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,566
ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN 

744
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,735
SEXUALLY HARASSED IN HISTORY BUT

745
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,336
THAT'S PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN 

746
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:46,871
GOING ON HERE.

747
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:53,511
AND AGAIN, HIS RESPONSE TO IT 

748
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,579
EXACERBATED IT.

749
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,847
FOR WOMEN AND THE ELECTION AND 

750
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,316
ALL OF THAT, WE HAVE REAL 

751
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,518
PROBLEMS NOW WITH TWO OF OUR 

752
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,520
MAJOR INSTITUTIONS OF 

753
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:02,820
GOVERNMENT.

754
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,990
YOU HAVE A MAN WHO'S VERY LIKELY

755
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,094
TO JOIN THE SUPREME COURT, WHO 

756
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,496
DESPITE HIS OP-ED IN THE WALL 

757
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,897
STREET JOURNAL TODAY SAYING HE 

758
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,500
WOULD BE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL 

759
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,302
JUDGE, TESTIFIED IN A VERY, VERY

760
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,503
PARTISAN FASHION BEFORE THE 

761
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:18,736
SENATE.

762
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:22,474
AND YOU HAVE A SENATE THAT IS SO

763
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,344
DIVIDED THAT THE -- AS WE HAVE 

764
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,745
SAID EARLIER, ONE DEMOCRATIC 

765
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:29,848
VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH.

766
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,149
ONE REPUBLICAN VOTE ESSENTIALLY 

767
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:31,950
AGAINST HIM.

768
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,055
YOU KNOW, THROUGHOUT MUCH OF OUR

769
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:41,793
HISTORY, THEY DIDN'T CALL THE 

770
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:41,993
ROLL.

771
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,061
THEY SAID FINE.

772
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:43,895
THAT'S GONE.

773
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,229
THE SPEECHES WE HEARD TODAY 

774
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,365
LEADING UP TO THIS VOTE, FROM 

775
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,267
THE LEADERS OF THE SENATE, THE 

776
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,402
TWO LEADERS OF THE JUDICIARY 

777
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,837
COMMITTEE AND THEN THE TWO 

778
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:58,442
LEADERS OF THE SENATE, CHUCK 

779
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:00,779
SCHUMER AND MITCH McCONNELL WERE

780
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,413
SO PARTISAN AGAINST EACH OTHER 

781
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:06,384
AND ACCUSING HARD RIGHT AND HARD

782
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,186
LEFT GROUPS OF INFLUENCING THE 

783
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:08,419
MEMBERS.

784
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,221
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY HARD

785
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,257
FOR THE SENATE TO COME BACK FROM

786
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,159
THIS NOMINATION IN A WAY THAT 

787
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,527
THEY CAN COOPERATE WITH EACH 

788
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,630
OTHER AND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY,

789
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,964
VERY HARD FOR THE COURT.

790
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,699
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A 

791
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,601
CERTAIN CLOUD OVER THEM.

792
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,470
>> SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT, 

793
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:25,670
COKIE.

794
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,608
>> TERRY, IT'S SO TRUE WE 

795
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,109
HAVEN'T HEARD THE PARTISAN 

796
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:33,778
RHETORIC WHEN IT COMES TO A 

797
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,479
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE USED BY 

798
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:38,249
THAT NOMINEE HIMSELF LET ALONE 

799
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,385
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

800
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,953
WE HEARD FROM CHUCK GRASSLEY 

801
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:42,987
THIS MORNING.

802
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,256
THEN, DIANNE FEINSTEIN.

803
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,925
CLEARLY THE PARTISAN LINES 

804
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,492
DRAWN.

805
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,926
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT MOMENT IN 

806
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,328
OUR COUNTRY FROM THE SENATE AND 

807
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,729
CERTAINLY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, 

808
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,565
BUT THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF HAS

809
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:56,033
BEEN SOMEWHAT INSULATED FROM 

810
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,470
THAT FOR SO MANY YEARS, I'M SO 

811
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,606
CURIOUS WHAT THE JUSTICES ON THE

812
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,074
COURT THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY 

813
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,342
WITNESSED OVER THE COURSE OF THE

814
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,610
LAST WEEK OR TWO?

815
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,012
>> Reporter: THAT'S A GREAT 

816
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:08,913
QUESTION, DAVID.

817
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,949
THEY DREAD WHAT'S HAPPENING.

818
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,117
HOWEVER THEY FEEL ABOUT JUDGE 

819
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:13,384
KAVANAUGH.

820
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,286
THIS PLACE STILL HAS A VERY 

821
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,854
ESTIMATION IN THE OPINION OF 

822
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:17,821
MOST AMERICANS.

823
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:19,323
THEY RESPECT THE SUPREME COURT 

824
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:20,825
FOR THE MOST PART.

825
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,393
IT'S DAMAGED ITSELF IN RECENT 

826
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,061
YEARS WITH A COUPLE OF RULINGS 

827
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:27,432
IN OUR PARTISAN TIMES.

828
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,834
BUT YOU NOTICED THAT THE SUPREME

829
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,770
COURT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WAY OF 

830
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,474
ENFORCING ITS OPINIONS, EXCEPT 

831
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:42,013
ITS OWN LEGITIMACY IN THE HEARTS

832
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,816
OF AMERICANS.

833
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,685
CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS IS AN

834
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:48,519
INSTITUTIONALIST.

835
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,555
HE HAS PRACTICED HERE FOR 30 

836
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:50,755
YEARS.

837
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,891
HE LOVES THIS INSTITUTION.

838
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,892
I KNOW WHATEVER HE THINKS ABOUT 

839
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:58,195
BRETT KAVANAUGH HE'LL BE 

840
00:29:58,195 --> 00:29:59,530
CONCERNED GOING FORWARD, HOW DO 

841
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,666
I PROTECT THAT REPUTATION, THE 

842
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,101
TRUE SOURCE OF THE COURT'S 

843
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:03,401
AUTHORITY. 

844
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,403
>> TERRY, OUR THANKS TO YOU 

845
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:05,636
AGAIN.

846
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,772
>>> MARY BRUCE, SOME INTERESTING

847
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:11,342
COLOR COMING IN TO US FROM THE 

848
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:11,676
CHAMBER.

849
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,978
SENATORS COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI 

850
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,880
WHO HAD BEEN SIDE BY SIDE 

851
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,548
THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THESE 

852
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:18,749
PROCEEDINGS WERE GREETED RIGHT 

853
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,885
AFTER THE VOTE.

854
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,254
SENATORS COMING OVER TO SHAKE 

855
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,056
THEIR HANDS.

856
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,825
OBVIOUSLY, THE TWO WOMEN VOTED 

857
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:28,158
DIFFERENTLY. 

858
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:29,360
>> Reporter: YEAH, THEY'RE 

859
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,929
REPORTING A THEY WERE GREETED BY

860
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,498
BOTH PARTIES LIKE CELEBRITIES.

861
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,999
DEMOCRATS COMING OVER TO SHAKE 

862
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,235
LISA MURKOWSKI'S HAND.

863
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,604
THE REPUBLICAN FROM ALASKA WHO 

864
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:43,708
JOINED DEMOCRATS ON VOTING NO 

865
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:49,580
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

866
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,249
AND SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN 

867
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:53,251
WRESTLING WITH THIS DECISION, 

868
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,288
SHE HAS BEEN MEETING WITH 

869
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,889
CONSTITUENTS IN HER OFFICE 

870
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:01,259
TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH WHAT SHE 

871
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,293
WAS GOING TO DO.

872
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,762
TODAY, JOINING HER PARTY IN 

873
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,031
SUPPORTING BRETT KAVANAUGH.

874
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,466
>> JON KARL, 51 VOTES TO 

875
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:11,469
MINIMIZE THE DEBATE AS WE MOVE 

876
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,270
FORWARD AND MOVE CLOSER TO THAT 

877
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,106
FINAL VOTE ON BRETT KAVANAUGH.

878
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,475
IT'S LOOKING CLEARER BY THE 

879
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,143
MOMENT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

880
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,279
COULD BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT 

881
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:22,513
JUSTICE.

882
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,581
THEY HAVE TO BE HAPPY OVER AT 

883
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,081
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

884
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,183
>> ABSOLUTELY.

885
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,951
CLEAR POLITICAL IMPACT HERE AS 

886
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:27,485
WELL, DAVID.

887
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,287
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SENATORS THAT

888
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,923
WERE IN PLAY HERE, SO MANY FROM 

889
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:35,526
STATES THAT DONALD TRUMP CARRIED

890
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,093
DRAMATICALLY, REPUBLICANS 

891
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:38,796
