>> POLLS OPENING IN ONE OF THE
BIGGEST PRIMARIES IN THE
COUNTRY, THE JUNGLE PRIMARY IN
CALIFORNIA HAPPENING TODAY, THE
PRESS LOOKING TO PICK UP SEATS
IN THE STATE IN A BID TO REGAIN
THE MAJORITY BUT IF MORE
DEMOCRATS PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE
BALLOT COULD THAT SPELL DISASTER
FOR THE PARTY IN A STATE THAT
ALLOWS THE TOP TWO REGARDLESS OF
PARTY TO ADVANCE?
AND GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
THIS JUNGLE PRIMARY IS SOMETHING
CALIFORNIA VOTED ON, PROPOSITION
14 AND IT ALLOWS THE TOP TWO
VOTE GETTERS REGARDLESS OF PARTY
TO ADVANCE.
DEMOCRATS HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE
RUNNING THIS TIME AROUND, COULD
SPLIT THE VOTE AND REPUBLICANS
COULD END IT BENEFITING.
>> DEMOCRATS LOVE THE IDEA THEY
ADOPTED IN 2009 THAT MAY NOT BE
LOVING IT TONIGHT BECAUSE THE
ISSUE IS SO MANY DEMOCRATS
RUNNING IN INDIVIDUAL RACES AND
REPUBLICAN SOLIDIFIED BETWEEN
ONE, 2 OR 3 CANDIDATES, TWO
REPUBLICANS ARE THE TOP TWO VOTE
GETTERS AND NO DEMOCRATS MAKE IT
TO THE ELECTION, AND THE 38TH
AND 49TH DISTRICT, AND THE EASY
PICKUP, AND TWO STRONG
REPUBLICANS, AND 6 DEMOCRATS
HAVE REAL MONEY.
THEY COULD BASICALLY THEY
ADVANCE.
REPUBLICANS WENT NOT HAVE TO
SPEND ANY MONEY IN NOVEMBER IN
RACES THEY SPEND MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS.
>> THERE ARE 17 CANDIDATES
REPLACING SOMEONE, BEING SPEND
IN THAT RACE ALONE.
DEMOCRATS PENDING THREE, CLOSE
TO $8 MILLION IN THE TOP TWO
SPENT 100,000.
ACROSS THE BOARD FOR BOTH
PARTIES, AND IN 2010, $1 MILLION
SPENCE, $26 MILLION, OUTSIDE
MONEY COMING IN.
>> $26 MILLION
MONEY COMING IN.
>> $26 MILLION LESS THEN ANOTHER
COMPETITIVE DISTRICTS, DEMOCRATS
IN FREAK OUT MODE BECAUSE OF
THIS JUNGLE PRIMARY SYSTEM,
TRYING TO ELEVATE ONE OR TWO
CANDIDATES IN DIFFERENT RACES TO
MAKE SURE THEY MAKE THE BALLOT
IN NOVEMBER.
IT IS GREAT FOR TRUMP AND AT THE
SAME TIME, THE NUMBERS FOR
REPUBLICANS ON THE GENERIC
BALLOT.
>> BERNIE SANDERS AND JOE BIDEN
ARE BOTH BUYING A 2020 RUN, AND
ARE TOP OF THE LIST, IS THAT THE
BEST THEY HAVE?
>> THESE TWO CANDIDATES APPEAL,
BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS, AND TRYING
TO MIMIC TRUMP IN THE AGE ISSUE.
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMEBODY CLOSE TO
BEING A GREAT GRANDFATHER
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN,
MORE POWER TO HIM AND IN THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY HAVE NO
BENCH, NO BARACK OBAMAS, AND
STARTING TO STEP UP, THEY
BENCH, NO BARACK OBAMAS, AND
STARTING TO STEP UP, THEY HAVE
BEEN VICE PRESIDENTS, AND IF
DEMOCRATS RUN PEOPLE FROM EITHER
COASTS THEY ARE IN TROUBLE.
THEY HAVE TO WIN TRUMP VOTERS IN
WISCONSIN, OHIO AND
PENNSYLVANIA, LOOKING TO THESE
TWO, THE OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE
NO SHOT AT FLIPPING TRUMP VOTERS
WHO ARE SEEING INCREDIBLE
ECONOMIC SUCCESS, 270,000 NEW
MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE THE
PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED.
THEY HAVE TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO
CAN SAY THAT IS A BAD THING FOR
YOU.
HEATHER: IF BERNIE SANDERS DOES
RUN WILL HE DO BETTER THIS TIME
AROUND IF THE DNC DID NOT GET
