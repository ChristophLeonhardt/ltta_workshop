THERE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE CASE OF THE TWO
BLACK MEN WHO GOT ARRESTED FOR
ESSENTIALLY ASKING TO USE
THE BATHROOM AT STARBUCKS.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS AS A
RESULT.
AMAZING.
THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING.
COOLEST PEOPLE ALIVE.
I WOULD'VE LOOKED FOR A PAYDAY
FOR SURE, BUT I AM TERRIBLE.
THEY ARE RECEIVING SOME
COMPENSATION FROM STARBUCKS.
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT?
I COULD BE WRONG, BUT I WAS
READING THAT STARBUCKS IS
OFFERING THEM A SETTLEMENT AS
WELL, BUT FROM THE CITY
THEY ARE RECEIVING THIS.
SOME PEOPLE ONLINE WERE SAYING,
YES, THEY ARE TRYING TO DO
THE TAYLOR SWIFT ONE DOLLARS AND
THE MESSAGE THING.
IT IS NOT ABOVE THE MONEY, WHEN
THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH
WITH ONE DOLLAR BUT ULTIMATELY,
I THINK THAT IS WONDERFUL,
THAT THEY ARE FUNNELING THAT
MONEY INTO PLACES I COULD
BE BETTER SERVED TO EDUCATE
AND INFLUENCE YOUNGER
GENERATIONS TO MAKE AWESOME
THINGS IN THE FUTURE.
THERE'S NO BAD HERE.
SO GREAT.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
THE STARBUCKS THING.
HOPEFULLY IT'S AN UNDISCLOSED
SUM.
I THINK THEY JUST GOT GIFT
CARDS FROM STARBUCKS.
STARPOINTS.
ON YOUR POINT ABOUT THE
DOLLAR, THE ONLINE STUFF
THAT YOU HAD SEEN.
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST OR EVEN
THE THOUSAND EXAMPLE OF
SOMEBODY TAKING A DOLLAR ON THE
CIVIL SUIT.
OFTENTIMES CIVIL SUITS ARE
FILED TO MAKE A POINT, CIVIL
RIGHTS POINT OR OTHER AND THE
DOLLAR IS OFTEN TIMES THE
AMOUNT THAT IS SOUGHT.
YOU CAN TELL, HEY, IT IS A
HIGHER IDEAL THAT IS BEING
APPLIED HERE.
THAT IS THE REASON THEY WENT FOR
A DOLLAR TURN OF, IN THIS
CASE THE DOLLAR WAS TO BE
SYMBOLIC AND MORE IMPORTANT
THING THAT FOLLOWS IS THE GRANTS
MONEY AND THEY REEDUCATION
PROGRAM THAT THEY ARE DOING AT
STARBUCKS ARE
THE FOLLOW-THROUGH IS
IMPORTANT.
HERE IS THAT STARBUCKS
ANNOUNCED THAT IT REACHED AN
AGREEMENT FOR AN UNDISCLOSED
FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT AND
I'LL STARBUCKS IS GOING TO
CONTINUE TO LISTEN AND
CREATE A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE
PARTIES AND THE OPPORTUNITY.
I LIKE HOW STARBUCKS IS REALLY
LEANING INTO THIS.
I DO THINK THAT THEY NEEDED A
DAY, THEY ARE TAKING THE DAY MAY
29 TO CLOSE ALL DOORS TO HAVE
TRAINING ON RACIAL BIAS
WHICH SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT
THAT IS NOT COOL.
I THINK THAT IS A STEP IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION FOR A
COMPANY TO SAY, THIS IS WHAT WE
CAN DO SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.
THE RACIAL BIAS TRAINING IS
ONE THAT HAS KIND OF BECOME
EN VOGUE FOR VARIOUS
CORPORATIONS BECAUSE AS
OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS WAY OF
DOING IT WHICH LOOKED AT
FOLKS AND WAS LIKE OKAY, THIS
GUY IS THE PROBLEM, YOU ARE
BEING A PROBLEM AND IT IS YOU
PERSONALLY, IT IS MICHAEL'S
GUY HERE OF THE OFFICE WHO IS
THE PROBLEM.
NOW IT IS LIKE, IT IS NO ONE'S
FAULT, IT IS PROBABLY JUST
IMPLICIT.
SOME PEOPLE ARE MAKING
ASSUMPTIONS THAT NO ONE
EVEN KNOWS THAT THEY ARE
MAKING, IT IS JUST IMPLICIT SO
LET'S ADDRESS IT.
AT LEAST IT IS GETTING ADDRESSED
IN THESE GUYS AND THEIR
LEGAL TEAM ARE PLAYING A ROLE IN
THAT AND I THINK THAT IS GREAT.
THEY ARE CLOSING 8000
STORES, THEY'RE GOING TO PASS
OFF AMERICA.
THAT 2 PM COFFEE RUSH THAT
YOU DON'T GET IS GOING TO BE
DIRE, BUT ALSO THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY, IF YOU WANT TO GET
FINANCIAL WITH IT, THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY THAT STARBUCKS IS GOING TO
LOSE WITHIN THAT TIMEFRAME IS
SUBSTANTIAL, SO AGAIN, I LOVE
STARBUCKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
YOUR MOCHA LATTES AND YEAH,
IT IS GOOD STUFF.
HERE'S A STATEMENT FROM THE
MAYOR.
YOU WANT THE MAYOR TO REALLY
STRIKE, THE CITY OF
BROTHERLY LOVE TO MAKE IT UP.
HE GOES:
WAY TO HIT THE EMOTIONAL
TONE THERE, JIM KENNEY.
DID YOU JUST RUN A BUNCH OF
LEGAL TERMS THROUGH A BLENDER?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE MOST
HILARIOUS STATEMENT, AND ATTEMPT
TO BE LISTEN, WE WANTED TO FOCUS
ON THE FUTURE OF AMERICA
AND RIGHTING WRONGS.
HE HAS LIKE IT WOULD'VE BEEN A
LOT OF LEGAL PAIN.
PRETTY CRAZY.
