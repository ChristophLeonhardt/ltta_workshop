“The piece of metal
that remains in my body
was meant to kill me.
Suddenly, I was not
who I am.
I was an
evidence locker.”
“Still have three bullets
inside of me
that doctors
did not remove.
It can often do more
damage trying to
fish out all those pieces
than just leaving it there.”
“Here is this foreign object
in my body
that shouldn’t be there.”
“Gunman is on the loose —”
“Armed with a
Sig Sauer MCX rifle —”
“With an AR-15 —”
“And our hearts pour out
to the people in Florida —”
“Bullets started coming
through our classroom door
and then seconds later,
my whole body shook.
I was super curious to see
the pictures of what they took
out of me when they
had surgery to remove
some of the fragments.
One of those is like clearly
the shell casing.
The doctors show you
for a quick second
and then all that gets
given to the police.
You don’t even
get to keep it.
I mean, I’m not going to
make it into a necklace
or anything,
but I feel like
I carried it around in
my body for years,
that I should
be able to have it.
It’s mine.
Just last year —
10 years later —
I found out that some of the
bullet fragments on this side
had found their way
into my hip joint
and were causing the
lead levels in my blood
to elevate
to dangerous levels.
It just, like, kind of
deflated me.
I mean, it was like, you know —
I made all this progress.
I had this life.
I had a wife and kids.
Like, was totally moved on
and, like, doing well.
And now, it’s not over.
In fact, it’s this whole
other different problem.”
“It felt more like a bee sting
than anything else.
I actually didn’t
realize something
was wrong until I
had already picked
my 17-year-old daughter up,
thrown her against the wall
and covered her
with my body.
The bullet hit my rib
and it tracked around
until my spine.
It still causes quite a bit of
pain, especially if it moves.
I could have said, ‘This is
his rage inside my body.’
But I couldn’t
let it be there.
So I had to reimagine
that bullet as lucky
and a little bit
of a spark of life
inside me, encouraging me.”
“My leg started vibrating
and raised from the floor.
I was, like, laying
to the right.
I was, like, holding Martin,
so the bullets I received
in the left side.
I remember feeling
the left femur one
because it touched my femur
and exploded.
And he died next to me
on the floor.
I saw him die next to me.
You can see all
these little dots.
It looks like sand.
If they could take them out,
probably they would be more
easy to erase from my memory.”
“It just felt like
I was this, like,
warm ball of numbness.
I remember that day asking
for my friend’s phone
so that I could look at
myself in the face.
I had, like, blood down my face
and I had blood in my hair
and I couldn’t see
out of one of my eyes.
I remember looking at myself
and I was like,
‘Who is that?’
My body took all
of the shrapnel
from, like, the students —
the two students who were
shot and killed next me.
At one point, I
could like wiggle
around the piece of metal
that was above my lip.
I also have shrapnel
behind my right eye.
It kind of haunts my
dreams because like,
I’m scared that I’m going
to be, like, 40 years old
and I’m going to wake up
and I can’t see out of
one of my eyes.”
“I can instantly
go from chatting
with someone to
tears in my eyes
because the bullet
aggravated a nerve.”
“What happens to long-term
lead levels is super scary.
I mean, this is, like,
cognitive decline
and, like, neuro issues.”
“Aesthetically speaking,
it’s not a very visible thing.
But underneath the
surface, it is for me.
And I don’t really
care how many people
tell me I’m beautiful.
It doesn’t change
that feeling of not
belonging within your body
because it’s — it's not
who I was before.”
“The shooter —
I try to think that
he is a no one.
Like an individual
that doesn’t exist.
And that’s how I
treat the bullets, too.”
