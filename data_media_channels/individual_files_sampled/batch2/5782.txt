that's 1954 a young lawyer named Joseph whelps standing up to Joseph McCarthy and his anti-communist crusade our friend Richard Haass sees a parallel between that moment and a blistering column yesterday from retired four-star Navy Admiral William McRaven McRaven who commanded the mission that killed Osama bin Laden directly challenged President Trump and his quote McCarthy era takin's in the words of McRaven you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children humiliated us on the world stage and worst of all divided us as a nation good morning welcome to Morning Joe it's Friday August 17th I'm Willie Geist with us we have NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent the host of KCDC on MSNBC KC hunt almost not recognizing the lightening anymore has it worn out its welcome this time although I was I do wish we could have Donny in there he needs some well it's a man really who needs no title or sound effect that's the great Donny Deutsch we also have with us Republican communications strategist and an MSNBC political contributor Rick Tyler Republican strategist an MSNBC political analyst not pictured here Susan Dell / CEO surprised winning columnist and the associate editor of The Washington Post an MSNBC political analyst Eugene Robinson political reporter for The Daily Beast Betsy Woodruff and former NATO supreme Allied commander retired four-star Navy Admiral James stavridis he is chief international security and diplomacy analyst for NBC News and MSNBC in an operating executive at the Carlyle Group Joe and mica have the morning off so let's get right into this and some new reporting from the Washington Post that President Trump feels emboldened by stripping X CIA director John Brennan of his security clearance Trump believes he's emerged looking strong and decisive in his escalating feud with Brennan two aides are telling the Post adding the president shows a visceral disdain for the former CIA director when he sees him on television White House officials say Trump did not focus on his power to remove clearances until this summer White House aides confirmed that Trump made his decision weeks ago about Brennan who serves as an NBC News contributor senior advisors including press secretary Sarah Sanders recommended to the president that they announce the action Wednesday amid the onslaught of news coverage about former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman's new book which accuses president Trump of having made racist remarks among other things CIA director Gina Haskell is remaining silent about the treatment of her predecessor asked if hats will approved to trump stripping Brennan of his security clearance and if she'd known about it or advised the President on the issue in advance CIA spokesman Tim Barrett told The Daily Beast only CIA does not comment on individual security clearances but twelve former top Intel officials including CIA directors Webster Tennant Goths Hayden Panetta and Petraeus signed a letter that states this we feel compelled to respond in the wake of the ill-considered and unprecedented remarks and actions by the White House regarding the removal of John Brennan's security clearances it goes on we all agree that the president's action regarding Brennan and the threats of similar action against other former officials has nothing to do with who should and who should not hold security clearances and everything to do with an attempt to stifle free speech you don't have to agree with what Brennan says the letter goes on and again not all of us do to agree with his right to say it subject to his obligation to protect classified information this comes after former Navy Admiral William McRaven who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden wrote a public letter challenging the President to revoke his security clearance Makura cape and writes that brennan is one of the finest public servants i've ever known few Americans have done more to protect this country than John therefore I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency if you think for a moment that your McCarthy era tactics will suppress the voices of criticism you are sadly mistaken the criticism will continue until you become the leader we prayed you would be again that's for Merl McRaven directed at the President of the United States so Admiral stavridis let me go to you on this you are intimately familiar with many of the men and women on that letter what's your reaction this morning I would focus on the letter I think that is an extraordinary document and to see all of those former directors of the CIA and deputy directors of the CIA going back 30 years is really quite striking and there's kind of three quick pieces to hit on here first is John Brennan I know I'm extremely well he is as straight as the gate he is an absolute public servant in a a great thinker number two is why do people have these security clearances after they get out of office it's so they can go back and consult and help government and we see that example again and again and many of the people on that list do exactly that and people in office need that I needed it when I was supreme Allied commander and was able to consult with my predecessors in that job and then lastly you just have to ask yourself as a technique the politics of this are just awful if we're going to start stripping security clearances what comes next we're going to take away pensions we're gonna have special tax examinations for former officials that speak out it's a it's frightening to see the division this is causing that's what I really worry about is the polarization this is another example of it will Admiral what do you make of the argument coming out of the White House and and some conservative circles as well which is that security clearance after you leave is not a birthright the president has the right to take this away and this is a man in John Brennan who is no longer the CIA director no longer works in the government and they say is working to undermine the city and commander in chief I think that's nonsense and again the reason people hold these security clearances principally is so they can be helpful they can advise that can remain appraised to facts we would give away generations of experience if people did not have the ability to look at the facts in a classified setting and provide advice to their successors that is a good thing and we should not let that go Willie you know Gene Robinson reading reporting from your newspaper The Washington Post today about President Trump being embolden as watching as this has played out he feels better today than he did even yesterday or the day before about how this looks feels that makes him look strong and is now considering removing the security clearances of a number of other people whose name was on a list that the White House made public that was under review including James clapper General Michael Hayden and others the president likes what he sees in this yeah he thinks it looks great to have an enemies list the way President Nixon had an enemies list and to have it all be public actually and out there this is this is a just a blatant abuse of power I mean I don't know what else you can call it and and and really should be one of the eventual articles of impeachment I mean this is it this is really pretty outrageous he's kind of trying to punish individuals because they are critical of him there's an element of calculation and what he's doing there's also an element of sort of two-year-olds tantrum that is it's deeply disturbing it's it hurts the country more than it hurts John Brennan who will be fine it's short-sighted it's kind of everything that Donald Trump is one thing here that I think is important to point out Willie is that the president is actually not on an island by himself on this right now because there is a quite a significant level of Republican support for what he did and Rick Tyler I'm curious your take on this because I mean the the antipathy toward John Brennan that is coming from Republicans across the hill and not just you know anti-drug never Trump Republicans I mean it's pretty deeply seated the only Republican I heard yesterday you know acknowledge that Brennan should keep his clearance with Susan Collins and even she said I don't really like her Brennan's done yes she qualified it but there are three things I don't like about this one is that he he decided to include call me for instance who already had a security clearance revoked which meant he just wanted to publicly stick it to call me there was no there's he didn't have a screw didn't call me another person with no friends on - it was pretty clear that he did this for to quell the political damage as it was coming from the Amargosa release of the tapes and they wanted to and look that's not new it's unwise but it's not new but it illustrates that he doesn't really play well with others right I mean these are former administration CIA directors with the Intel he's been in a war with Intel and it's a luxury of his character what he likes to do is diminish others to build himself up so but I take issue with the one thing that kind of bothers me this isn't about free speech you don't need a security clearance to have free speech you know I don't have a security clearance I have free speech all of them have their security clearance if they have them all revoke they will still have free speech I don't think that's a really good central argument well I actually think it is it's basically why it was taken away basically because he's speaking if they can still speak ok still some reason why but that was the punishment for that you know I'd go back to Jean it is so NIC Sonia and we do have an enemies list here and it's interesting you take like John Brennan I would love to have tracked the last 30 years of John Brennan's life what he did what his day was like what his public service was to this country and contrast it with Donald Trump's last 30 years I have to tell you I have to applaud Admiral McRaven that is what has got to start to happen in this country on every level people speaking out in ways they haven't before public servants speaking out and once again to me the real villains in this are the Republicans are you know there is no level that Donald Trump cannot sing to I think that this point will be surprised with Casey you know in your be - tell me that there is not one Republican out there that does not have an issue with stripping the security comes with making our country one-tenth of 100 words not one there has been some Susan Collins qualified and bob Corker spoke out about it weeks ago very forcefully but for the most part yesterday we saw people saying hey you know the president had the right to do you know just as Jack Nicholson said when they took him off the wall you made country a little less safe today now that we do not have the the decades of experience to go to who knows in a situation of be if Brennan being called on does not give a piece of information that now he will not be able to be brought in because of a security clearance this country gets a little sadder every single day I do think to Willie it's so interesting that all of these as the Admiral was pointing out all of these top officials standing up and saying no this is not OK because the reality is one excuse Republicans have been using when they talk about why they're ok with something the President Trump is doing is that he has trusted national security officials around him Jim mattis you know as a name that gets thrown out a lot well you ever you ask Republicans as to you know what the what the national security implications of all of this is say give credit where it's due bob Corker did say yesterday that this is a banana republic move to strip the security clearance of the former CIA director and let's not forget susan that the president gave up the game in that interview Wednesday night with Wall Street Journal when he said this really was what he called about the Sham Russia investigation and Brennan's perceived connection to that right and once again the president puts himself above country and he shows that he is a feckless coward who know him would want to ever be in a foxhole with because he never has anyone's back but what's more important I'd like to ask the Admiral about this is these folks who have clearance they also have individual relationships that go back decades with people around the world with whether it's their knowledge on terrorism or other issues cyber security and can you maybe get into the the how that really affects how the Intel community does their job not having access to those specific relationships that perhaps a new person may not have like Pompeo for example you know that's a really good point in I was gonna add to that and say look at the optics of this outside the country bob Corker head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee saying that this looks like a Banana Republic and believe me that comment gets picked up translated into two hundred different languages they have to figure out the context of a Banana Republic but it is going to reverberate again and again in that international arena and you're right to point out that this will have a chilling effect on those national security officials formers and how they are viewed and all of it will reduce our national security that's absolutely right thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the
