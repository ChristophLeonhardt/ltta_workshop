MARIA: WELCOME BACK THE SENATE VOTING ON A NON-BINDING RESOLUTION TO OPPOSE GIVING RUSSIA ACCESS TO U.S. OFFICIALS. ALLOWING SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER ACCESS TO THE 12 RUSSIAN S INDICTED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. PUTIN MADE THE SUGGESTION DURING THAT HELSINKI NEWS CONFERENCE WATCH THIS. WE CAN ACTUALLY PERMIT OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF THIS VERY COMMISSION HEADED BY MR. MUELLER, LET THEM INTO THE COUNTRY AND THEY WILL BE PRESENT AT QUESTIONING AND THEN WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE AMERICANS WOULD RECIPRO INDICATE AND SO WE CAN BRING UP MR. BROWD ER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. MARIA: BRING UP MR. BROWDER. JOINING US RIGHT NOW IS THE MAN, BILL BROWDER. HE IS A THORN IN PUTIN'S SIDE NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS. BILL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING THANKS FOR JOINING US. GREAT TO BE HERE. MARIA: LOOK I KNOW YOU A LOT OF YEARS, BILL AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YOUR STORY FOR A LOT OF YEARS BUT EVEN THEN, FOR ME, AFTER KNOWING THE STORY AS WELL AS I DO, I'VE GOT CHILLS DOWN MY BACK WHEN I HEARD VLADIMIR PUTIN MENTIONED YOUR NAME. WHAT DID YOU THINK? WELL, I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT HE'S BEEN MENTIONING MY NAME ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. IN FACT I WOULD GO SO FAR AS SO SAY VLADIMIR PUTIN IS OBSESSED WITH ME. HE'S OBSESSED BECAUSE I WAS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FORGETTING THE HIS CORRUPTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND HE HATES THAT. MARIA: SO TELL US ABOUT THAT YOUR STORY AT ONE POINT, ONE OF THE LEADING INVESTORS IN RUSSIA. YOU OWNED A LOT OF RUSSIAN COMPANIES, RUSSIAN STOCKS IN YOUR CAPITAL FUND YOU WERE AWARE OF CORRUPTION GOING ON, ACTIVE INVESTOR CALLING OUT THIS AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED, BILL? WELL SO AFTER EXPOSING CORRUPTION IN THESE BIG COMPANIES, PUTIN EXPELLED ME FROM THE COUNTRY, DECLARED ME AS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY. THE POLICE THEN RAIDED MY OFFICES IN MOSCOW, SEIZED ALL MY DOCUMENTS I HAD A YOUNG LAWYER START TO INVESTIGATE AND HE FIGURED OUT THEY SEIZED THOSE DOCUMENTS TO STEAL $230 MILLION HE EXPOSED IT. PRE-TRIAL DETENTION, TORTURED FOR 358 DAYS AND KILLED AT THE AGE OF 37 IN A RUSSIAN PRISON ON NOVEMBER 16, 2009 AND SINCE THEN , I'VE PUT ASIDE EVERYTHING ELSE I'M DOING ON A MISSION TO GET JUSTICE FOR HIM WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE MAGNITSKYNITSKY ABOUT WHICH PUTIN HATES ME FOR. MARIA: AND IT BASICALLY PROTECTS COMPANIES AND PUNISHES THOSE WHO TRY TO HAVE FRAUD AND STEALING OF THE WEALTH BY THE OLIGARCHS AND PUTIN IS UPSET BY THAT. LET'S SHOW YOU THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD WROTE A PIECE ABOUT YOU THIS WEEKEND SAYING DONALD TRUMP MEET BILL BR OWDER. IT BEGINS LIKE THIS, VLADIMIR PUTIN KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS FROM HELP IN SILENCING BUSINESSMAN HE AND MR. BROWEDDER WERE BOTH TARGETED BY FUSION GPS THE POLITICAL GUN FOR HIRE THAT THE STEELE DOSSIER IN 2016 TELL US THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS SOME OF THE MONEY FROM THE MAGNITSKYN ITSKY CASE IN NEW YORK , THEY OPENED UP A CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH AND FUSION GPS CAME INTO WORK FOR THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCH SO A SMEAR CAMPAIGN ON ME AND THEY PUT TOGETHER ALL OF THE TALKING POINTS ABOUT ME FOR THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING WHERE SHE WENT INTO SPEAK WITH DONALD TRUMP JR. AND I WOULD DEDUCE THAT FUSION GPS AND GLENN SIMPSON THEREFORE PUT TOGETHER THE SAME TALKING POINTS FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN BECAUSE THEY WERE THE SAME SO IN THAT HELSINKI MEETING LAST WEEK, VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF ABOUT ME FROM GLENN SIMPSON. MARIA: WELL THE SENATE VOTED DOWN ANY IDEA THAT RUSSIANS WOULD BE ABLE TO QUESTION YOU AND DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY AGREED WITH THAT, SO THAT'S NOT HAPPENING BUT I'VE SEEN SOME OF YOUR QUOTES IN THE PRESS. YOU'RE AFRAID THAT IF IN FACT THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN. WELL BASICALLY EVEN IF THERE'S ONLY 1% CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING IF I GET HANDED OVER TO THE RUSSIANS AND TO VLADIMIR PUTIN, I WILL BE KILLED, THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THEY MADE DEATH THREATS ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTED TO BE KILLED. VLADIMIR PUTIN WANTS ME DEAD. THIS IS NOT, THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER. MARIA: NOW THE CHARGES THAT HE LEVELS AGAINST YOU WHICH WERE ALL DEBUNKED, BUT HE SAYS YOU AVOIDED TAXES IN RUSSIA AND IN THE U.S. AND THAT YOU GAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HILLARY CLINTON. YOUR REACTION. WELL, HE'S BEEN THROWING OUT CHARGES AGAINST ME LIKE CANDY. THESE PARTICULAR CHARGES HAVE BEEN ANALYZED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, BY BEEN REJECTED. IT'S JUST COMPLETE NONSENSE. ZERO CONTRIBUTIONS TO HILLARY CONTRIBUTIONS, AND IN FACT THIS IS ZERO. MARIA: IT'S AN INTERESTING SITUATION BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PAST IN TERMS OF VLADIMIR THROWN IN JAIL NOT TO MENTION THE ENDLESS NUMBER OF MURDERS OF JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, AND ENEMIES OF PUTIN. THEN AGAIN, RUSSIA AND THE U.S. CONTROL 90% OF THE WORLD'S NUCLEAR CAPABILITY. WHAT DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP DO? HE HAS TO WORK WITH THE OTHER PARTNER OF THE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT A PICTURE TOGETHER OF WHO VLADIMIR PUTIN IS. WELL I THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD DO IT WHAT RONALD REGAN DID. I MEAN, RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION HAVE HAD THESE NUCLEAR WAR HEADS FOR A LONG TIME. UNION AND DONALD TRUMP SHOULD CONTAIN RUSSIA. THIS IS NOT, YOU DON'T MAKE FRIENDS AND BUDDY BUDDY UP TO A HOSTILE POWER AND THAT'S WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN THING. THIS IS IT'S UNAMERICAN TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN CONTAIN ARE SEEING A NEW ERA AND IT SEEM BUT WE WILL KEEP WATCHING THAT, BILL BROWDER, GOOD TO HAVE YOU
