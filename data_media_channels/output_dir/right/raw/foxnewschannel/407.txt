1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,223
REPORT.

2
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:04,258
>> Martha: AND WE AWAIT THE

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,860
REPORT, WHICH SHOULD COME AT ANY

4
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:06,194
MOMENT.

5
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:07,395
THE PRESIDENT GOES WHERE HE

6
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:08,129
REALLY HASN'T GONE, AT LEAST IN

7
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,832
THE SAGA, TAKING SOME SWINGS OF

8
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,700
THE CREDIBILITY OF CHRISTINE

9
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:13,534
FORD.

10
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:15,136
>> President Trump: 36 YEARS

11
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:15,637
AGO, THIS HAPPEN.

12
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:18,172
I HAD ONE BEER.

13
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:18,473
RIGHT?

14
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:22,377
I HAD ONE BEER.

15
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:23,678
WELL, YOU THINK -- NO, IT WAS

16
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:24,345
ONE BEER.

17
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:24,946
HOW DID YOU GET HOME?

18
00:00:24,947 --> 00:00:27,382
I DON'T REMEMBER.

19
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:28,583
HOW DID YOU GET THERE?

20
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:29,984
I DON'T REMEMBER PEER HOW MANY

21
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:30,618
YEARS AGO WAS IT?

22
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:35,757
I DON'T KNOW.

23
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:36,591
>> Martha: A LOT OF CRITICISM

24
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:38,593
FOR THAT, BUT YOU HEAR THE CROWD

25
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:39,560
IN MISSISSIPPI LAST NIGHT.

26
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,929
JENNA ME NOW, BEN SHAPIRO,

27
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,531
EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE DAILY

28
00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:45,400
WIRE AND HOST OF THE BEN SHAPIRO

29
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:47,001
ELECTION SPECIAL, WHICH IS

30
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:50,972
WIDELY POPULAR.

31
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:52,974
ON THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT,

32
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:53,608
TAKING THOSE AT SWINGS AT

33
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,977
CHRISTINE FORD.

34
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:57,445
>> TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT

35
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:58,179
ONCE.

36
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,782
HE CAN BE POINTING OUT SOME REAL

37
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:02,150
HOLES IN CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S

38
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:03,351
TESTIMONY.

39
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:04,619
THE SECOND, THIS IS NOT

40
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,019
PRODUCTIVE.

41
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:05,753
THERE ARE A LOT OF SENATORS WHO

42
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:07,188
ARE SITTING ON THE FENCE, AND

43
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:07,889
ANY EXCUSE FOR THEM TO VOTE

44
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,992
AGAINST KAVANAUGH IS A MISTAKE.

45
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:12,727
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING OUT AND

46
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:14,295
DOING THIS RALLY, OBVIOUSLY

47
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:15,029
PROVIDING FODDER FOR PEOPLE ON

48
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,365
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO WANT

49
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,500
TO AVOID MAKING THE HARD CHOICE

50
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,568
ABOUT KAVANAUGH.

51
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:21,369
INSTEAD, HOPE TO DUMP ON THE

52
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,404
PRESIDENT THAT I'M NOT SURE

53
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:24,739
THERE IS POLITICALLY SMART BY

54
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,206
THE PRESIDENT.

55
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:26,974
I AM NOT A FAN OF HIM RIPPING

56
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:29,343
INTO FORD, PERSONALLY, BUT ARE

57
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,244
THERE HOLES IN HER STORY?

58
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:32,146
THAT PART HE IS RIGHT ABOUT.

59
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:33,981
>> Martha: HE ALSO RAISED THE

60
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:35,650
ISSUE OF MEN, YOUNG MEN, BOYS,

61
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,285
THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY ARE

62
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:41,122
IN, AND THAT PROMPTED ALYSSA

63
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:41,856
MILANO, WHO IS WE ALL REMEMBER

64
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:44,659
WAS SITTING BEHIND JUDGE

65
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,793
KAVANAUGH AS HE ANSWERED THE

66
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:47,228
QUESTIONS AT THE HEARING WITH A

67
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,998
NOTEBOOK THAT SAID "VOTE NO" ON

68
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:51,265
IT.

69
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:54,168
HERE'S WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.

70
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,571
"CRY ME A RIVER," BASICALLY.

71
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:58,372
WATCH THIS BEARD >> WOMEN, YOUNG

72
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,775
PEOPLE OF HAD IT DIFFICULT FOR

73
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:01,509
GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS AND

74
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,410
GENERATIONS APPEAR WE WILL NOT

75
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,378
BE SILENCED ANY LONGER.

76
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,780
IF THAT MEANS THAT MEN HAVE A

77
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,749
HARD TIME RIGHT NOW, THEN I'M

78
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,416
SORRY, THIS IS THE WAY THE

79
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:11,352
PENDULUM HAS TO SHIFT.

80
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:11,819
>> Martha: BEN?

81
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,222
>> I MEAN, IT IS KIND OF

82
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:15,690
SHOCKING TO SEE THAT DUE PROCESS

83
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:16,290
SHOULD NOT APPLY TO MEN.

84
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,594
THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF SEXISM,

85
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:20,728
THE IDEA THAT ROLES SHOULD NOT

86
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:21,596
APPLY TO PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF

87
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,331
THEIR GENETICS.

88
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:26,200
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY DISCRIMINATION

89
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,268
OF THE HIGHEST ORDER, BUT THIS

90
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,336
IS THE WORLD WE NOW LIVE IN,

91
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:30,471
WHITE MEN PRESUMED GUILTY

92
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:31,973
BECAUSE THEY ARE WHITE MEN,

93
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:32,774
SUPPOSEDLY IN A POSITION OF

94
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:33,474
PRIVILEGE BUT I WAS NOT AWARE

95
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:37,011
THAT KAVANAUGH FOR     FORFEITED

96
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:37,044
THAT KAVANAUGH FOR     FORFEITEH

97
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,913
THAT KAVANAUGH FOR     FORFEITES

98
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:39,647
RESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BECAUSE

99
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:41,582
OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN OR THE

100
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,183
NATURE OF HIS GENETICS.

101
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:43,117
>> Martha: IT IS A VERY

102
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:44,919
INTERESTING ARGUMENT.

103
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,754
YOU LOOK AT CLARENCE THOMAS

104
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:47,789
DEFENDING HIMSELF, AN

105
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,123
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN, A JUDGE

106
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:49,891
WHO WANTED TO SIT ON THE COURT.

107
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:51,659
NOW YOU HAVE BRETT KAVANAUGH IN

108
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,894
THIS UNIQUE POSITION, WHICH I

109
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:53,594
GUARANTEE HE NEVER THOUGHT HE

110
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,998
WOULD BE IN, WHERE HE IS RAISING

111
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,200
THE FLAG FOR WHITE MEN AND

112
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:01,202
SAYING THAT THEY, LIKE EVERYONE

113
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,804
ELSE, NEED TO BE TREATED ON AN

114
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:04,138
INDIVIDUAL BASIS ON THE FACTS

115
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:04,872
THAT SUPPORT THEM OR THE FACTS

116
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:08,342
THAT GO AGAINST THEM.

117
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:10,745
>> MOB RULE IS NEVER A GOOD

118
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:11,045
IDEA.

119
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:11,746
THE FACT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH

120
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:14,782
HAS BEEN TURNED INTO MERELY A

121
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:19,754
WHITE GUY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE

122
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:20,454
LEFT SEES THINGS IN TERMS OF

123
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:24,525
RACE AND SEX.

124
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:25,226
CORY BOOKER SAID THAT TODAY.

125
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:26,060
>> Martha: WE HAVE THAT.

126
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:28,262
LET'S PLAY THAT AND GET YOUR

127
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:28,629
REACTION.

128
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,996
GO AHEAD.

129
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:32,400
>> ULTIMATELY, NOT WHETHER HE IS

130
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,434
INNOCENT OR GUILTY, THIS IS NOT

131
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:33,768
A TRIAL.

132
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,738
BUT ULTIMATELY, ENOUGH QUESTIONS

133
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,740
BE RAISED THAT WE SHOULD NOT

134
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,542
MOVE ON TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE.

135
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:43,344
>> Martha: YOUR THOUGHTS?

136
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:47,348
>> I THINK CORY BOOKER RAISES

137
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,149
SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS

138
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,983
CANDIDACY EVERY DAY, BUT IN

139
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:49,884
ORDER TO OUST HIM FROM THE

140
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:52,320
SENATE, YOU WOULD NEED EVIDENCE,

141
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,155
NOT JUST THE IMPLICATION THAT HE

142
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:54,722
IS A.

143
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,357
>> Martha: IT IS REMARKABLE --

144
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:58,125
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE

145
00:03:58,126 --> 00:03:59,160
CONSTRUCT OF HIS HEARING THAT WE

146
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,962
SAW, IT IS NOT A COURT OF LAW,

147
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:02,096
BUT AT THE HEART OF IT, IS THE

148
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:04,232
ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY OF THESE

149
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,835
TWO PEOPLE AND WHETHER OR NOT IT

150
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:09,103
WAS SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF

151
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:09,971
PROVING THAT THIS HAPPENED THAT

152
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:10,271
NIGHT.

153
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:11,706
I THINK EVEN IN THE END, YOU

154
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:13,708
WILL HAVE PEOPLE THAT FEEL

155
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,775
UNSATISFIED BY THE AMOUNT OF

156
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:15,977
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD TO

157
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:17,378
BASE THEIR DECISION ON.

158
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:18,713
BUT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL, AREN'T

159
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:19,780
THEY DECIDING IN THEIR MIND

160
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,616
WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK HE WAS

161
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:22,149
GUILTY OR INNOCENT?

162
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,352
>> NO QUESTION.

163
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:25,853
THE IDEA THAT THIS IS JUST A JOB

164
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:27,555
INTERVIEW SO IF YOU RAISE ENOUGH

165
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:28,356
QUESTIONS THAT IS ENOUGH, THAT

166
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:30,925
RULES OUT ANYONE WHO IS GOING TO

167
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:32,360
HAVE A JOB OFFER ON THE SENATOR

168
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:33,127
LEVEL BECAUSE IT IS NOT HARD TO

169
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,762
RAISE QUESTIONS.

170
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:36,364
THIS IS NOT MERELY A JOB

171
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:37,965
INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A

172
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:39,533
MAN WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF

173
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:41,769
ATTEMPTED A RAPE.

174
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,803
IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE DOESN'T

175
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:45,873
END UP ON THE SUPREME COURT, HE

176
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:46,908
WOULD PROBABLY LOSE HIS SEAT ON

177
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,542
THE D.C. COURT OF APPEALS, AND

178
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:49,176
HIS FAMILY IS DESTROYED.

179
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:50,611
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DESCRIBED

180
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:54,749
DECIDED TO PLAY THIS WAY.

181
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,851
THEY'RE TRYING TO RATCHETED UP,

182
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:57,251
OBVIOUSLY.

183
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:58,319
>> Martha: LOOKING TO THE NEXT

184
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,786
FEW DAYS FOR US.

185
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:01,455
YOU ALREADY FEEL, AS THIS REPORT

186
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:04,358
IS ABOUT TO COME OUT, SO MUCH

187
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,760
PUSHBACK FROM DEMOCRATS,

188
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:06,727
PRIMARILY AT THIS POINT, AND ALL

189
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:07,461
OF THE THINGS THEY HAVEN'T SEEN

190
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,363
AND HEARD.

191
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:11,232
THEY ARE PREPARING THEIR

192
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:11,599
ARGUMENT.

193
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,368
>> SENATOR FLAKE WAS BASICALLY

194
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:15,102
GAMBLING BY USING THIS FBI

195
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:16,804
REPORT AS THE FINAL WORD THAT

196
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:19,140
THIS IS GOING TO GET MURKOWSKI

197
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:19,707
AND COLLINS ON BOARD.

198
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,008
WE WILL SEE IF HE IS RIGHT OR

199
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:21,742
NOT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT COMES

200
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:24,912
DOWN TO.

201
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:25,846
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF RED STATE

202
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:29,150
BLUE SENATORS WHO ARE IN TROUBLE

203
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,252
AND MAY NEED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF

204
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:32,853
KAVANAUGH IF THE FBI REPORT

205
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,255
COMES BACK AS CLEAN AS IT IS

206
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:34,956
EXPECTED TO.

207
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:36,257
THIS IS SO PARTISAN AT THIS

208
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:37,959
POINT THAT THIS GOES ALONG PARTY

209
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,561
LINES, UNLESS, AGAIN, ONE OF

210
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:41,495
THOSE TWO SENATORS SHOCKS US.

211
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:42,797
>> Martha: WHAT CONCERNS YOU

212
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:43,397
WANT THIS WHOLE THING?

213
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:44,799
AS HE LOOKED BACK AND GO AT THE

214
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,801
BIG PICTURE OF IT AND LONG TERM

215
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:49,337
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COUNTRY?

216
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:50,538
>> THE PARTISAN NATURE OF

217
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,440
SUPREME COURT HEARINGS HAVE BEEN

218
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:53,107
KNOWN SINCE THE BORK DAYS.

219
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:55,443
WE ARE NOW SEEING THE

220
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:57,511
WILLINGNESS TO BELIEVE IN

221
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:58,913
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT POLITICAL

222
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:00,181
OPPONENTS WITHOUT ANY SORT OF

223
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:01,315
CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE, IT

224
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:02,717
REALLY DOESN'T SPELL THE END OF

225
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:03,784
CIVILIZED SOCIETY PEER NO GOOD

226
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:05,319
PERSON IS GOING TO WANT TO GO

227
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,187
INTO POLITICS KNOWING THEY CAN

228
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:07,421
BE DESTROYED AT A MOMENT'S

229
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:09,056
NOTICE BY ANY ALLEGATION OF ANY

230
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:10,191
SORT BROUGHT BY ANYBODY.

231
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:11,525
THAT IS NOT EVEN SAYING THAT

232
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:13,728
FORD IS NOT CREDIBLE.

233
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:14,729
IT IS SUGGESTING YOU NEED

234
00:06:14,730 --> 00:00:00,000
CORROBORATION IN ORDER TO
