13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">know about the movie before you see it</font>

14
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,910
the better I at was actually invited to

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,770
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 minute screening of the movie we've</font>

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,100
London being sung who's not a huge fan

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,590
of 3d seeing it on this huge screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,590
it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> blew my mind and I was actually</font>

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,600
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a video about that about my</font>

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,070
excitement but then I thought I'll wait

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,480
until I've actually seen the movie and

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,610
have sinus substance and you're a big

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,010
Ridley Scott phone massive Ridley Scott

25
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">fire and alien Blade Runner do idea who</font>

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,859
doesn't like Ridley Scott don't watch

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,229
the video if don't like mr. Scott what I

28
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,840
don't think it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Ridley Scott</font>

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,400
phones no it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font>

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,710
prometheus is a film that you can watch

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,540
just being a sci-fi fan just being a

32
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,180
film fan really you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really</font>

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,270
watch alien to appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prometheus</font>

34
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,270
that is what I believe but alien is just

35
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make the experience better</font>

36
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,460
therefore makes for anyone he doesn't

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,250
know this is a it<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

38
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,990
prequel what actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened was</font>

39
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,759
Ridley Scott went to Fox<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it even</font>

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,840
got commissioned and he'd already

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,820
designed sort of the ship layout and the

42
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,590
suits they were wearing because he's

43
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,320
just very full on and he then gave the

44
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,400
script<font color="#CCCCCC"> to two writers one of which was</font>

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,860
Damon Lindelof he did lost and we are

46
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,320
both huge loss fans the reason why is

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's for me the metaphor of why</font>

48
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,460
we here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the meaning of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

49
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know anybody knows me I'm</font>

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,350
pretty intense I love films that are

51
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,990
about the bigger picture the search<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,180
answers of the world's biggest questions

53
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,159
and it was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of saw</font>

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,930
a lot of religious connections within

55
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,149
the film from watching it a second time

56
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,220
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a massive theme of the film</font>

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,288
it's only kind of there if you look for

58
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,110
it she mentions about wearing her

59
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,210
still believing in her religious use

60
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,150
which i think is quite interesting

61
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,030
considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a sci-fi and film which</font>

62
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,490
usually goes against religion definitely

63
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,420
these are ancient<font color="#E5E5E5"> civilizations that</font>

64
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,610
were separated by centuries and yet this

65
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,740
same pictogram was discovered in every

66
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,200
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them you're smiling I think they</font>

67
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,830
want us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine we're all here</font>

68
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,600
because of Matthew two kids found in a

69
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,140
cave not<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer an invitation for moon I</font>

70
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,150
was really hyped up about the movie the

71
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,280
trailers just make you really excited

72
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,700
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only going to disappoint</font>

73
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,380
people that have that much excitement

74
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,540
and actually waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the reviews to</font>

75
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,760
come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that knocked it a bit you know</font>

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,110
said there were issues there were plot

77
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,580
holes and stuff like that it was

78
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,800
visually good but the script was flawed

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,110
some people saying i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean i'm glad i</font>

80
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,250
read those reviews because they

81
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,350
downplayed my expectation i did a video

82
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,430
recently called a drop in the ocean

83
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,390
which is about how we on the grand scale

84
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,850
how long the planets being here yeah we

85
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,680
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been here very long at all and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,630
got quite depressed thinking about how

87
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,459
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology is changing at the</font>

88
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,260
moment and like we can probably

89
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,180
understand what we're going to develop

90
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the future that we're probably not</font>

91
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,840
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be around to see it and that kind</font>

92
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,709
of saddens me like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to leave</font>

93
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,390
this life until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have all the answers</font>

94
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,400
and like lost that's what it was about

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,920
really you know when lost ended there

96
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">were still questions when you had</font>

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,739
answers there were more questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

98
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:46,940
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a pretty cool but it also</font>

99
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,620
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> it open for another film if you</font>

100
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,150
want to imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i will</font>

101
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,610
possibly want them to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they</font>

102
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,920
are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already said they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

103
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,330
damon lindelof said when he wrote the

104
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,610
script that and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a prequel</font>

105
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,310
you know how it's gonna add but he says

106
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prometheus like if alien</font>

107
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,160
was said you write a 2 y yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

108
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,470
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gang going back to like lost</font>

109
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,820
its the whole point when the series<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

110
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,070
over that's kind of like your life sober

111
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,450
no still questions later it's really

112
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,130
wait cuz i got really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sucked into lost i</font>

113
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,418
was a bit of a losing with lawson at the

114
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">end ask you what was his full name Peter</font>

115
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,349
Wayland played by Guy Pearce who is the

116
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:25,370
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that funded the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

117
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,910
mission and it turns out that he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

118
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship they were cryogenically frozen</font>

119
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,510
went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this ship because they had to go</font>

120
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,669
like was at two and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> half years and he</font>

121
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,139
said that he only had a few days to live

122
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,970
anyways so he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be cryogenically</font>

123
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,150
frozen until this exhibition happened

124
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,850
for him to meet his maker and it goes

125
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,590
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what I was saying about we have</font>

126
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,110
such a short time on this planet are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

127
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,610
ever going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be satisfied because the</font>

128
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,979
conclusion the movie was it doesn't

129
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,330
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you found out who created</font>

130
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,660
humans cuz he punched him in the face

131
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,340
you find out who created us but then who

132
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,110
created them that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> she keeps her</font>

133
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,690
religious beliefs because you came from

134
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,940
them she obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> is religious person</font>

135
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,169
believes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> God there were a lot of</font>

136
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:07,940
criticisms about the movie plot holes

137
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,310
and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really find that many plot</font>

138
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,410
holes the one thing that bothered me was

139
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,180
near the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end was as the shit was</font>

140
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,289
crashing the two main characters are

141
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,960
running away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from ale and it was a thin</font>

142
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,990
ship falling that way and they kept

143
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,000
running that way they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always run</font>

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,160
forwards yeah but they're not crabs yeah

145
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,840
I know they should have run out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

146
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,120
but but saying that if I was to give it

147
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,940
plausibility in<font color="#E5E5E5"> moments of panic the</font>

148
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,979
rational thinking you just guys are

149
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,210

friends who've gone to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea in a being</font>

162
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,280
disappointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's just because</font>

163
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,289
they're expecting something that gives

164
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,270
answers to alien because it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

165
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,340
space jockey and it was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird</font>

166
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,800
because when i watched the movie

167
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,720
straight away<font color="#E5E5E5"> like i ripped for oh we're</font>

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,770
not going to see much of the space

169
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,830
jockeys and then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they examine the</font>

170
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,599
head and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized to be a helmet I</font>

171
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,940
was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of disappointed thinking I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

172
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,380
thing is gonna be an alien creature but

173
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,490
then by the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I was like</font>

174
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,460
actually no<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is amazing the</font>

175
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,719
thing i will say about the movie in

176
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,900
conclusion is it's a future classic

177
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,150
and what I think always<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens with</font>

178
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,100
movies that go down in history is

179
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,500
awesome movies and there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

180
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,449
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do really well as soon as they</font>

181
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,150
come out but it's ones that especially

182
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,650
in sci-fi and horror they always get

183
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">slighted like donnie darko rotten</font>

184
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,340
tomatoes if you go on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> website where</font>

185
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,539
they take all the reviews in the world

186
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,490
and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a blender donnie darko got</font>

187
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,259
slated when it first came out and then

188
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,300
when people saw it was a cult following

189
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,580
and people started realizing oh it's a

190
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,949
film you watch again and again yes yeah

191
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean I do think it is going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

192
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,570
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those films like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tiger depending on</font>

193
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,220
you say like this thing is one of those

194
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">films for me that an old classic I do</font>

195
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,120
it's gonna be a film that interesting is

196
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,400
time you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have people younger</font>

197
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,840
than you maybe your kids or anything

198
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,030
gonna be like watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> prometheus such a</font>

199
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,830
good food over like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when I was</font>

200
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">like 20 well you mean you look at things</font>

201
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">like alien that was like 30 years ago</font>

202
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">you always look at classic films you</font>

203
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,710
know I wonder what it would be like to

204
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,570
watch it then but now this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

205
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,479
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those men I do wonder like if I Lin</font>

206
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,039
fans will be disappointed I think if

207
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,080
you're expecting it to be an alien movie

208
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,729
alien fans are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be disappointed</font>

209
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,889
by that because I'm massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact no</font>

210
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,630
no I'm saying I love the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's</font>

211
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">open to everyone I'm saying alien fans</font>

212
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,340
who are disappointing is because they're

213
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,039
expecting like it to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely about</font>

214
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its own movie like music but</font>

215
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,510
for me there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two types of albums</font>

216
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,039
there are ones that you get them

217
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,690
straight away and you love it because

218
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're obvious singles on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the album and</font>

219
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,560
then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got ones that take a while</font>

220
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,300
to grow on you and like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to let</font>

221
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,760
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> soak in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> corrales yeah the film's I</font>

222
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,159
love and the shows i love the music club

223
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,560
is always about humanity and it's stuff

224
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,470
that just asks the bigger questions

225
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,539
because i was watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> site this is a</font>

226
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,539
bit of a digression but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Neil Tyson he's</font>

227
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,190
an astrophysicist<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay he says the</font>

228
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,900
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been spent in</font>

229
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,060
the history of NASA is less than the

230
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,039
bank bailout they recently done yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

231
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,030
he says the fact they're cutting back

232
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,699
the space programs is a joke because

233
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:32,870
they haven't got their priorities right

234
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,169
and he said that decades ago people in

235
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,789
the world started<font color="#E5E5E5"> dreaming about the</font>

236
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,469
world of tomorrow like we could go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

237
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,630
space we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see new planets and because</font>

238
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,789
we're cutting all that back now yeah you

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
promotion or doing another spreadsheet

241
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Prometheus the years of 2009 I think</font>

242
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,240
93 yes I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but but this movie</font>

243
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,019
makes me want us to go into space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

244
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go they found planets are inhabitable</font>

intelligent than we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are asking the same</font>

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,180
questions and it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

250

here somewhere to my a drop in the ocean

252
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:17,660
because there's a clip at the end of

253
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,850
that video where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it zooms out of earth</font>

254
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,380
and shows you how big the universities

255
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,959
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you just have to go we have to</font>

259
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,600
of those golden tickets that's it well

260
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,740
recently they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about if</font>

261
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,420
there was ever a journey to Mars<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

262
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,040
colonize it it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a one-way trip</font>

263
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">and would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to be one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

264
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,810
people because I said it was like death

265
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,310
which is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> something was brought</font>

266
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,290
up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prometheus this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is why she they</font>

267
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,550
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I thought they were</font>

268
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,259
going to quote lost which is this place

269
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,660
is death it's like if you left when an

270
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,440
exhibition he weren't coming back um

271
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,149
that's quite terrifying I think it would

272
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,149
depend on emotionally where you are in

273
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,180
your life<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is good point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz</font>

274
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,829
it was it was the same with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wayland</font>

275
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:06,110
wasn't it he was he was in his last days

276
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,300
of life and before he dies yes he wants

277
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,279
to meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> his creator say I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

278
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,660
conclusion of this movie it's white

279
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Donnie Darko does well people that</font>

280
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,649
review the movie for its what it is are

281
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,449
people that come out like we're doing

282
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,160
now except we've kind of gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

283
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,660
next stage which is discussing the

284
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,310
issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking about this stuff</font>

285
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,560
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's what this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what fit that is</font>

286
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,870
what makes film ticket and art yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

287
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,730
is what causes discussion and look at

288
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,649
the bigger picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the fact that an</font>

289
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,899
epic sci-fi with all these cool graphics

290
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,490
by the way the intro he said it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

291
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">good my boy I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of whispered mother I</font>

292
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,839
was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try had given too</font>

293
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,300
much away but when ya when stuff happens

294
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,399
when she went in that chamber to get the

295
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,149
baby the fetus removed I'd seen in the

296
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,439
trailer when you pause it you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

297
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:53,279
thing floating above

298
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,990
and actually what I thought the ending

299
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,339
was going to be before I'd seen it was

300
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,749
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used to create</font>

301
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first denim wolf which is the alien</font>

302
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,249
yeah and it did happen but indirectly

303
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,379
when I was connecting the trailer and

304
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:05,699
was seen there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

305
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">the movie and knew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was coming yes</font>

306
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,740
it's sports it a bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was in a</font>

307
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,999
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> different context I think</font>

308
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,829
average ratings are like eighty percent

309
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,470
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a fair review but for</font>

310
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,569
me on a personal level it's way beyond

311
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:21,059
because it connects with what sort of

312
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,170
stage i'm in my life at the moment

313
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,300
favorite films are things that make me

314
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,269
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out go home and leave me buzzing we</font>

315
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,699
were like thoughts why not have a little

316
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,470
think about life is good the other thing

317
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,029
I'd say is I wish I'd seen it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

318
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,399
imax because when i saw the 20 minute

319
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,259
preview it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also because ridley scott</font>

320
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:38,490
was there they put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this huge</font>

321
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,309
screen and I was completely immersed and

322
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,990
like that when it did the shot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

323
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,180
rotating in space around the shit the

324
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,529
sound of the engine roaring was

325
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,600
completely immersive yeah as a where we

326
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,059
saw it today the free d was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but it</font>

327
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:53,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't as immersive and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

328
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:54,509
see again for that think of what about

329
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:59,009
man maybe I wasn't very<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed by the</font>

330
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,839
trailer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed by</font>

331
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,160
the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> trailer that one it was</font>

332
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,309
kind of just tell miles that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

333
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,410
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really excited about math but I isn't</font>

334
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that good thing I'm not because then I'm</font>

335
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,149
all I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be impressed when it's</font>

336
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:13,410
think the best thing possible is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

337
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,589
just how few expectations crushed isn't

338
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,600
that they say about life they say

339
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,339
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going through anything</font>

340
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,620
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worst possible outcome and</font>

341
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,240
realize that me better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll be a</font>

prometheus and when driving home from

351
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,519
watching it there was like one major

352
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,079
part in the film<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to talk about</font>

353
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm having to edit at the end well I</font>

354
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,529
really loved and I thought was one the

355
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,230
most profound moments of the film was

356
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,709
when Elizabeth Shaw met one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space</font>

357
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,740
jockeys homemaker and it was all about

358
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,600
Wayland asking the questions because he

359
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,920
had a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days left and she kept</font>

360
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,839
interrupting saying why<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you done</font>

361
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why he done that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why you got some</font>

362
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,389
of us killed yeah and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that moment she</font>

363
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">was effectively like that was a metaphor</font>

364
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
of what people like on planet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Earth you</font>

365
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,389
know when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say how could you</font>

366
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:30,370
believe in God when He allows bad things

367
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,470
to happen yeah like family which is the

368
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,689
main argument of our religion yeah when

369
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,009
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to the questions that</font>

370
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,990
matter if we ever found our Creator

371
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,240
that's what people would ask is why did

372
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,220
you abandon us or why are you trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

373
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,310
destroy our they're bad things yeah and

374
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,430
the truth is it was probably out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

375
00:13:48,430 --> 00:00:00,000
their control yeah yeah
