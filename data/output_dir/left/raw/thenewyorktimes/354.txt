00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Caregiving is something
that people go into

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,890
most likely because they have a family
member that needed caregiving.

3
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,230
But most likely caregiving happens because
they have compassion for the person

4
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,450
that went through that particular incident
to require caregiving.

5
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,280
It’s also something
that you do out of love.

6
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,020
In 2017, Hawaii passed the Kupuna Care Act.
Kupuna means elder in Hawaiian,

7
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,880
and the program will pay $70 a day
to family caregivers.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,690
This payment helps offset caregiving 
expenses and supports hiring

9
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,310
part-time caregiving help.

10
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,270
The program is meant to help seniors who 
need some assistance

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,580
but wish to keep living at home.

12
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,560
The Kupuna program is very important for 
caregivers because you’re working

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,150
and you have to still take care of your 
elderly or your family member

14
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,380
while working full time or part time.

15
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,700
It’s very costly to caregive.

16
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:34,240
The medication, pamper supplies, the bed 
lining, the hygiene, it adds on.

17
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:45,130
If you have extra help just to give the
financial support to hire someone else,

18
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,670
so you can go to work the
next day and not be miserable.

19
00:01:49,670 --> 00:00:00,000
That's a big help.
