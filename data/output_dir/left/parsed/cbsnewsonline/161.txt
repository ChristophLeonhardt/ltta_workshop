>> WE ARE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM 
MARK ZUCKERBERG WHO WILL 
TESTIFY BEFORE A JOINT 
COMMITTEE ABOUT FACEBOOK'S 
FAILURE TO PROTECT ITS USERS 
DATA. 
AS SOON AS IT BEGINS, WE WILL 
TAKE YOU THERE LIVE. 
YOU CAN SEE A LIVE PICTURE OF 
THE ROOM RIGHT THERE. 
THOUGH THIS WILL BE THE FIRST 
DAY OF MARK ZUCKERBERG'S 
OFFICIAL TESTIMONY ON CAPITOL 
HILL, HE HAS SPOKEN TO SEVERAL 
LAWMAKERS PRIVATELY. 
HE SPENT YESTERDAY ON SOMETHING 
OF AN APOLOGY TOUR FOR ALLOWING 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA TO HARVEST 
THE DATA OF UP TO 87 MILLION 
FACEBOOK USERS AND HE REASSURED 
THOSE IN A POSITION TO PROPOSE 
REGULATING THE TECH SECTOR THAT 
THE COMPANY WILL DO BETTER IF 
ALLOWED TO POLICE ITSELF. 
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR PANEL. 
DAN PATTERSON, JENNIFER 
GREIDEL, AND, ROGER CHANG. 
DAN, LET'S START WITH YOU. 
CLEARLY,  MR. ZUCKERBERG NEEDS 
TO CONVINCE CONGRESS THAT HE IS 
THE MAN TO MAKE THESE CHANGES 
AT FACEBOOK. 
BUT, LET'S DISCUSS WHETHER HE 
REALLY IS THE PERSON TO LEAD 
FACEBOOK INTO THE FUTURE. 
DAN, LET'S START WITH YOU. 
>> WELL, IS CERTAINLY THE MOST 
POWERFUL PERSON IN FACEBOOK. 
THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER AND. 
THIS MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR HIM TO REALLY STEP UP HIS 
LEADERSHIP AND SHOW NOT JUST 
CONTRITIONS BUT NEXT STEPS. 
HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO 
ABOUT IT AN INSTEAD OF DOING 
THIS OH GOLLY SHUCKS THING, TO 
SAY IT IS SERIOUS. 
AND THE WAY WE OPERATE IT IS 
SERIOUS. 
WE WILL TAKE SERIOUS STEPS TO 
PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING 
AGAIN. 
>> JENNIFER, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
IS IT BETTER TO SPLIT UP 
FACEBOOK AND HAVE MULTIPLE 
LEADERS? 
>> TO HAVE HIM BE CEO AND HOLD 
THE MAJORITY OF SHARES IS IS A 
HUGE RISK. 
HE HAD SAID THE DATA OF 2 
BILLION USERS HAD BEEN 
COMPROMISED. 
WHEN YOU HIT THAT LEVEL OF 
CRISIS AND ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE 
TO START THINKING ABOUT RADICAL 
SOLUTIONS. 
AND MAYBE, WE NEED HIS 
AUTHORITY TO BE SPLIT UP AT 
THAT POINT. 
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? 
>> I THINK THAT IS A LOVELY 
THOUGHT. 
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF 
REALISTICALLY THAT WILL HAPPEN 
GIVEN THE CONTROL HE HAS OVER 
FACEBOOK. 
AND HE IS THE FACE OF FACEBOOK. 
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A 
ZUCKERBERG FACEBOOK WITHOUT 
ZUCKERBERG IN CHARGE. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS A 
PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO. 
>> HE CARES ABOUT HOW PEOPLE 
SEE HIM. 
HE CARES ABOUT HIS IMAGE. 
HE WENT ON THE NATIONAL TOUR TO 
TALK TO REGULAR FOLKS AROUND 
THE COUNTRY ALMOST AS IF IT WAS 
A PREPRESIDENTIAL, YOU KNOW, AS 
IF HE WERE WEIGHING THOUGHTS OF 
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SOME DAY. 
CLEARLY, HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AS 
THIS IDEALISTIC ENTREPRENEUR. 
HE SAID FACEBOOK IS IDEALISTIC. 
IT IS THE IDEA OF COMMUNITY. 
DOES THAT MESSAGE RESONATE 
ANYMORE? 
>> Reporter: WHAT IT DOES DO IS 
SYMBOLIZE FACEBOOK'S RESPONSE 
TO THESE TYPES OF CRISIS. 
WHILE THEY MAKE CHANGES, THEY 
PUT OUT CRISIS COMS AND PUT A 
BIG PRETTY FACE AS THEIR NUMBER 
ONE PRIORITY. 
SO, HE CAN GO ON A TOUR IF HE 
WANTS AND THEY CAN CERTAINLY 
PUT BIG PRETTY BUTTONS UP TO 
SAY WE WILL MANAGE YOUR 
SECURITY, BUT IT FEELS LIKE 
SPIN. 
>> SO ARE PEOPLE TIRED OF THE 
KUM BAH BHA MESSAGE? 
>> THE WAY HE HAS POSITIONED 
HIMSELF IS AS A PHILANTHROPIST 
AND SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BRING 
THE WORLD TOGETHER AND BUILD 
COMMUNITY. 
IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO 
LOOK AT HIM AND SAY YOU HAVE 
EXPOSED 2 BILLION PEOPLE AND 
THEIR PRIVACY AND DATA AND WE 
NEED TO REGULATE YOU. 
>> AND YOU MAKE MONEY OFF OF 
IT. 
>> A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY, SHE 
ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE ON 
THE PLANET SO IT IS HARD TO BE 
UPSET AT HIM WHILE HE IS 
FEEDING YOU THESE NICE LINES 
BUT AGAIN, WE NEED TO HOLD HIM 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
WE NEED OUR REGULATORS TO TAKE 
A HARD LOOK AT THIS COMPANY AN 
HOW THEY ARE IMPACTING US. 
>> RIGHT. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
A FAKE BLACK LIVES MATTER PAGE 
WAS EXPOSED VERY RECENTLY. 
APPARENTLY, ORGANIZERS OF THE 
REAL BLACK LIVES MATTER PAGE 
HAD ALERTED FACEBOOK TO THIS 
PAGE A WHILE AGO. 
WHAT WAS THE STORY THERE ROGER? 
>> IT TURNS OUT IT WAS SOMEONE 
WHO WORKED FOR THE UNION LABOR 
IN AUSTRALIA. 
A WHITE MAN WHO SET THIS UP, 
SOLICITED DONATIONS AND KEPT 
THEM. 
DID IT JUST TO MAKE A BUCK. 
THIS ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM 
THE PLATFORM HAS. 
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT FAKE NEWS 
OR THE WRONG KINDS OF ADS. 
THERE'S A BROADER PROBLEM WITH 
FACEBOOK. 
FACEBOOK DOESN'T QUITE HAVE A 
HANDLE ON IT YET. 
>> IT GREW TOO FAST AND TOO 
QUICK. 
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE UNDERLYING 
INFRASTRUCTURE OR ENOUGH PEOPLE 
THERE TO GOVERN IT IN A SAFE 
WAY. 
>> JENNIFER, YOU MENTIONED 
TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT SOMEDAY 
FOR THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. 
AS AN ENTITY. 
HOW SO? 
>> THIS IS A MONUMENTAL DAY TO 
HAVE MARK ZUCKERBERG SITTING 
BEFORE THE JOINT COMMITTEE AND 
SHOWING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE 
FIRST TIME. 
I HOPE OUR REGULATORS ASK HARD 
QUESTIONS TODAY AND GET SOME 
FACTS ON THE TABLE. 
THEN BUILD A STRUCTURE TO 
REGULATE THESE COMPANIES. 
I HOPE THEY SHOW THEY HAVE THE 
APPETITE TO DIG IN AND SHOW 
SOME REGULATION. 
>> AND WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
RELATIONSHIP TO ADVERTISING 
COMPANIES. 
IS THAT A FUNDAMENTAL 
RELATIONSHIP THAT NEED TO 
SHIFT? 
>> WELL, WE CAN LOOK TO 
PRECEDENT. 
HISTORICAL PRECEDENT. 
WE SAW MICROSOFT BEHAVE IN A 
SIMILAR WAY IN THE LATE 80s  
AND THE LATE 90s . BILL GATES 
WAS A ZUCKERBERG TYPE FIGURE. 
WHEN MICROSOFT WAS BROKEN UP, 
WE SAW IT PUT UNDER DIFFERENT 
LEADERSHIP TENTS. 
THAT IS SOMETHING WE MIGHT SEE 
HAPPEN WITH FACEBOOK. 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR 
ADVERTISERS WE SEE THEM SAYING 
THE ADVERTISERS WILL COME BACK. 
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
CULTURE CLASH WE ARE ABOUT TO 
SEE BETWEEN SILICON VALLEY AND 
CAPITOL HILL? 
>> WE SAW THIS IN NOVEMBER WITH 
GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AND TWITTER. 
WE WILL SEE IT AGAIN WITH 
ZUCKERBERG. 
CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT HIGH ON 
SILICON VALLEY'S PRIORITY LIST. 
DC IS USED TO MORE STABLE 
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES. 
I THINK WE WILL SEE A LOT OF 
BUTTING HEADS. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE 
TOPIC OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE 
TROLLS AND THESE RUSSIAN TROLL 
FARMS. 
WHAT IS ZUCKERBERG EXPECTED TO 
SAY ABOUT THOSE? 
THAT HE NEEDS HELP? 
>> THEY ARE TRYING TO RESPOND. 
AND, I THINK WHEN IT COMES DOWN 
TO ANY OF THESE FAKE NEWS 
PAGES, ANY OF THESE FAKE BLACK 
LIVES MATTER PAGES, THE REAL 
WORD WE NEED TO BE TALKING 
ABOUT IS EXPLOITATION. 
FACEBOOK UNLIKE OTHER SOCIAL 
MEDIA PLATFORMS IS RIPE FOR 
EXPLOITATION. 
THEY CAN'T SOLVE A TROLL 
PROBLEM OR THESE OTHER 
PROPAGANDA PROBLEMS WITHOUT 
TAKING A LOOK AT THE 
FUNDAMENTAL MECHANICS OF HOW 
THEIR SOCIAL NETWORK OPERATES. 
THAT MIGHT BE AN EXISTENTIAL 
THREAT. 
>> HE DID NOT WRITE THIS 
HIMSELF. 
BECAUSE HE IS BUSY ON HIS PAGE, 
BUT IT SAID IN AN HOUR I WILL 
TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THE SENATE 
ABOUT HOW FACEBOOK NEEDS TO 
TAKE A BROADER VIEW AS OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY TO USE THE TOOLS 
FOR GOOD. 
I WILL MAKE FACEBOOK A PLACE 
WHERE PEOPLE CAN STAY CLOSER 
WITH THE PEOPLE THEY CARE ABOUT 
AND MAKE SURE IT IS A POSITIVE 
FORCE IN THE WORLD. 
HE MAY HAVE WRITTEN IT. 
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HIS PR TEAM. 
WHO KNOWS. 
BUT THAT'S THE MESSAGE HE KEEPS 
REPEATING. 
HE IS A FORCE FOR POSITIVE 
CHANGE IN THE WORLD. 
>> THERE'S A LOT OF FEEL GOOD 
COMMENTS IN THERE. 
BUT, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF 
CONCRETE POINTS OR EVIDENCE 
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY DOING 
ANYTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEMS. 
>> AND WHY IT TOOK SO LONG. 
I THINK THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE ANGRY ABOUT. 
IT IS ONE THING TO SAY OOPS, 
THIS HAPPENED BUT IT IS ANOTHER 
THING TO SAY OOPS, THIS 
HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO. 
AND WE STILL DIDN'T GET A 
HANDLE ON IT. 
>> AND, THAT THERE IS NOT AN 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ALL OF THE 
BAD THINGS WE HAVE HERE AND 
THAT OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED IN 
THEIR LIVES. 
I THINK THAT THE REAL THING 
THAT IS MISSING HERE IS 
EMPATHY. 
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO FEEL THAT 
ACTUAL HARM HAS BEEN DONE TO 
HUMANS AND SAYING HEY LOOK AT 
THE GOOD THINGS HERE IN THIS 
HAND, FORGET ABOUT THE BAD 
THINGS HAPPENING HERE. 
>> AND ONE WONDER WHAT HE 
ACTUALLY FEELS BECAUSE IN 2011 
I BELIEVE IT WAS, HE WAS QUOTED 
AS SAYING PRIVACY IS DEAD. 
SO, ONE HAS TO WONDER DOES HE 
ACTUALLY FEEL THAT WAY? 
YOU KNOW, WHAT DOES HE THINK 
ABOUT OUR LIVES ONLINE? 
>> I THINK HE HAS BEEN WORKING 
TO ENSURE HIS OWN PRIVACY. 
WE HEAR ABOUT HOW HE BUYS THE 
HOMES NEXT TO HIS HOME. 
BLOCKS OUT OTHER PEOPLE. 
BUT, HE IS IN CONTROL. 
AND, HE STILL HAS HIS PRIVACY. 
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE 
TWO BILLION PLUS USERS AROUND 
THE WORLD. 
ESPECIALLY HERE IN AMERICA. 
THE FACTS ARE FACEBOOK HAS DONE 
A LOT OF HARM. 
AND A COUPLE OF SCENARIOS I'M 
SURE THEY HAVE DONE SOME GOOD, 
BUT THERE HAS BEEN REAL HARM 
FROM THE WAY HE HAS RUN HIS 
COMPANY. 
>> I WANT TO FOLLOW THAT UP 
WITH COMMENTS HE IS  EXPECTED 
TO SAME HE SAYS FACEBOOK HAS 
HELPED POSITIVE MOVEMENTS LIKE 
ME TOO. 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? 
>> I MENTIONED ME TOO AND LIVES 
FOR OUR LIVES ARE TWITTER USE 
CASES. 
IN PART, THEY WERE COORDINATED 
ON HIS PLATFORM. 
HE IS TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR 
SOME OF THE STUFF HAPPENING ON 
TWITTER WHICH DOES DRIVE A LOT 
OF SOCIAL CHANGES BUT HE IS 
REALLY SCRAPING TO FIND 
POSITIVE USE CASES. 
>> RIGHT, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT 
PACT OF -- PART OF HIS MESSAGE 
RESONATES. 
IF YOU ARE SUFFERING, IF YOU 
ARE A VICTIM IN THE ME TOO 
MOVEMENT, IT HELPS TO HAVE 
OTHERS SAY ME TOO. 
IT FORMS A SOLIDARITY. 
>> BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO MENTION 
SOME OF THE CRISIS IN MYANMAR. 
THE ETHNI CLEANSING THERE IS 
TAKING PLACE, WE KNOW ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE OF FACEBOOK AND THEIR 
FREE BASIS PROGRAM. 
THAT IS A CRISIS OVER THERE AND 
HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO 
ADDRESS IT. 
>> YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT 
JENNIFER, DAN, WHAT DO YOU 
THINK ABOUT THIS, THE WAY 
FACEBOOK HAS TO CHANGE 
PRIVACYSETTINGS DEFENDING ON 
THE COUNTRY. 
EUROPE IS ASKING FOR STRICTER 
PRIVACY SETTINGS AND THE U.S. 
WILL PROBABLY START TO ASK THAT 
AS WELL. 
HOW CAN FACEBOOK NAVIGATE THAT? 
>> FACEBOOK'S ARGUMENT IS THAT 
WE HAVE 2 BILLION USERS, THAT'S 
A LOT OF SCALE. 
TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS AT 
SCALE TO WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
RESPONDED THERE IS NO RIGHT TO 
SCALE. 
YOU DO NOT HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL 
RIGHT TO OPERATE AT LARGE SCALE 
AND IF YOU CANNOT OPERATE AT 
LARGE SCALE SAFELY, THEN 
PERHAPS YOU NEED TO BE REINED 
IN. 
WE WOULD SAY THE SAME THING TO 
AN AIRLINE COMPANY OR CAR 
MANUFACTURER. 
IF YOU CANNOT MAKE THE CAR OR 
AIRLINE SAFE, YOU HAVE TO FIX 
IT. 
>> WHY DO THEY HAVE A 
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MAKE US 
OPT OUT OF SHARING OUR 
INFORMATION RATHER THAN OPTING 
IN? 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? 
>> THAT IS INTERESTING. 
VERIZON SAND AT&T, THEY ARE SAL 
GAITING OVER THIS AD MARKET. 
BUT THEY ARE BOUND BY THE FCC 
WHERE THERE IS AN OPT IN 
MANDATORY REQUIREMENT. 
WITH THE TECH COMPANIES, THEY 
SHOULD LOOK INTO WHETHER OPT IN 
SHOULD BE THE STANDARD FOR TECH 
COMPANIES WHEN IT COMES TO 
PERSONAL DATA. 
>> THIS IS BIG IN EUROPE AS 
WELL. 
ESPECIALLY IN THE MARKETING 
SPACE. 
THE USER INTERFACE ON FACEBOOK 
WAS DESIGNED TO GET YOU TO 
CLICK ON THINGS AND DIVULGE 
MORE PERSON INFORMATION. 
IT WAS BY DESIGN. 
THIS WAS NOT A MISTAKE. 
>> JEN BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT. 
THERE WAS A SHIFT IN FACEBOOK A 
FEW YEARS AGO WHEN YOU COMPOSE 
AN E-MAIL OR EVEN A NOTE, YOU 
HIT SEND. 
EXPLICITLY YOU HAVE TO HIT 
SEND. 
FACEBOOK CHANGED THE COMMENTING 
SYSTEM AND THE NOTIFICATION 
SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME SO 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU TYPE YOUR 
SHORT COMMENT. 
THIS IS AFTER THEY TRIED TO BUY 
TWITTER. 
YOU HIT ENTER AND IT WOULD 
LEAVE A SHORTER FASTER COMMENT. 
YOU TIE THAT IN WITH A READ 
NOTIFICATION. 
YOU GET THE DOPAMINE PANG AND 
THEN THERMORE NOTIFICATIONS 
IN THE NETWORK. 
>> SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT THIS 
SHARING OF INFORMATION IS SO 
DEEPLY ENGAINED IN THE ALGA 
RHYTHM OF HOW FACEBOOK WORKS IT 
WOULD MEAN DISMANTLING IT AND 
RETOOLING IT? 
>> THE COMPANY IS DESIGNING THE 
INTERFACE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. 
WE HAVE SEEN HOW YOU DISCONNECT 
YOUR APIs . THEY MADE THAT 
EASIER. 
THEY ARE MOVING PRIVACY 
SETTINGS TO THE NEWS FEED. 
THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN IN PLACE. 
>> LET'S SAY THEY DO IMPLEMENT 
SOME SORT OF OPT IN TO SHARE 
INFORMATION RATHER THAN OPT 
OUT. 
WHO IS GOING TO OPT IN? 
NO ONE. 
>> THAT WOULD BE A SEVERE 
DETRIMENT TO ITS CORE BUSINESS 
MODEL. 
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE REALLY 
RELUCTANT TO DO THIS. 
>> THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
PROTESTERS THERE ON CAPITOL 
HILL HOLDING UP SIGNS. 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
IF THERE IS ANY REACTION FROM 
THOSE LISTENS TO THE TESTIMONY 
OF MARK ZUCKERBERG. 
HE MUST BE NERVOUS. 
HE LOOKED NERVOUS. 
WE SAW HIM COMING IN TO SPEAK 
WITH SENATORS YESTERDAY. 
HE HAD HIS GAME FACE ON, BUT 
LOOKED NERVOUS. 
>> HE IS NOT KNOWN FOR BEING 
THE MOST POLISHED SPEAKER IN 
CONTROLLED SETTINGS SO IT WILL 
BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE 
HOLDS UP TO HOURS OF TESTIMONY. 
SENATORS LOOKING TO GRAND STAND 
AND ASK SHARP QUESTIONS. 
>> HE HAD TO COME IN PERSON. 
WE KNEW THIS HAS BEEN LOOMING. 
WAS THERE ANY QUESTION WHETHER 
HE WOULD SHOW UP? 
>> NO, HE HAS TO SHOW UP. 
AND HE HAS TO SHOW UP NOT JUST 
TO FULFILL HIS RESPONSIBILITY 
AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER IN 
THE COMPANY, BUT ALSO, TO 
SATISFY LAWMAKERS. 
LAWMAKERS ARE CRAFTY AND GOOD 
AT ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. 
THEY ARE EXPERTS. 
>> DOES THAT APPLY TO THE TECH 
WORLD TOO? 
THE CULTURE CLASH BETWEEN 
SILICON VALLEY AND CAPITOL 
HILL. 
WILL THEY ASK THE RIGHT 
QUESTIONS? 
>> I MEAN, I IMAGINE THEY HAVE 
GOT AIDES COMING UP WITH THE 
EXACT QUESTIONS TO GET UNDER 
MARK'S SKIN. 
WE SAW IT A LITTLE BIT IN 
NOVEMBER. 
THOSE WERE GENERAL COUNSELS, 
LAWYERS. 
SOME OF THEM WERE GETTING FED 
UP BY THE SHEER REPETITION OF 
THE QUESTIONS. 
I'M SURE ZUCKERBERG HAS GONE 
THROUGH A FAIR AMOUNT OF MEDIA 
TRAINING FOR THIS. 
BUT IT IS HARD TO TRAIN ANYONE 
FOR TWO TO THREE HOURS OF A 
CONSTANT BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS. 
>> THERE IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF A 
CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST 
FACEBOOK. 
IS THE COMPANY PREPARED FOR 
THIS? 
>> DAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY 
COMPANY AT THIS SCALE IS 
PREPARED FOR ANY TYPE OF CIVIL 
ACTION, BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE 
A LOT OF LAWYERS SO I'M SURE 
...  
AND A LOT OF MONEY. 
SO I'M SURE THEY WILL BE 
PREPARED TO RESPOND IN SOME 
WAY. 
>> THIS COULD BE A MASSIVE 
CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THAT WOULD 
DWARF ANYTHING PREVIOUS, NO? 
>> 87 MILLION IS A FAIRLY LARGE 
NUMBER. 
SO YEAH. 
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S BRING IN 
CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ED O' 
KEEFE FROM WASHINGTON. 
WHAT ARE LAWMAKERS LOOKING TO 
HEAR FROM MARK ZUCKERBERG 
TODAY? 
>> I THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR 
HIM SAY WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN 
LEAKED OUT. 
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A VERY 
CLEAR APOLOGY. 
AND ACCEPTANCE OF 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAS 
TRANSPIRED BUT THEY WILL ALSO 
WANT SOME ANSWERS ON WHAT 
SPECIFICALLY THE COMPANY KNEW 
OR WHAT IT DIDN'T KNOW. 
AND WHEN IT LEARNED ABOUT WHAT 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WAS UP TO 
AND IF THERE IS MORE OF THIS TO 
COME OR IF HE IS WILLING TO 
REVEAL ANYTHING ELSE ALONG 
THOSE LINES. 
THE OTHER THING INTERESTING TO 
SEE IS WHETHER HE GETS DRAWN 
OUT OR CALLED OUT AT ALL. 
ON WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
CONGRESS OR FEDERAL REGULATORS 
DO. 
WHAT HE SAID IN HIS OTHER 
MEETINGS, EXECUTIVES SAID THEY 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE 
REGULATION FROM THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT. 
THAT WILL BE AN INTERESTING 
SIDE SHOW IN ALL OF THIS. 
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS CERTAINLY  
EAGER TO DO THAT. 
YOU HAVE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO 
ARE IN FAVOR OF TAKING SOME 
REGULATORY STEPS. 
BUT, OTHERS WHO WOULD PREFER TO 
SEE FACEBOOK AND OTHER SIMILAR 
COMPANIES SELF-REGULATE OR COME 
UP WITH WAYS TO MAKE CLEAR TO 
CUSTOMERS THEIR DATA IS 
PROTECTED. 
SO, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WILL 
HAVE A POLICY DEBATE OVER THE 
COURSE OF THIS. 
BUT WHAT THIS WILL PROBABLY 
HELP FOLKS WHO TRACK THE POLICY 
SIDE OF THIS AND THE POLITICS 
IS GET A BETTER SENSE OF AMONG 
THE 40 OR SO SENATORS, WHAT IS 
THE APPETITE FOR POTENTIAL 
REFORM AND WHAT IS THE 
TIMETABLE FOR THAT? 
REMEMBER, WE ARE IN AN ELECTION 
YEAR. 
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO 
DO ANYTHING DRAMATIC OR 
CONTROVERSIAL, MOST OF 
WASHINGTON IS WORRIED ABOUT 
WHAT HAPPENS IN NOVEMBER THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE. 
>> SURE, 61%, YOU KNOW, IN OUR 
OWN POLLS SAY THAT USERS 
ACTUALLY WANT INCREASED 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION TO SOCIAL 
MEDIA. 
AND TECH COMPANIES. 
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT 
POTENTIAL REGULATION COULD LOOK 
LIKE HERE. 
>> YOU ARE ASKING ME? 
>> YEAH. 
>> IT COULD BE A FEW THINGS. 
SOME OF THIS COULD BE DONE 
OBVIOUSLY THROUGH THE FEDERAL 
TRADE COMMISSION. 
OTHERWISE F IT COULD BE DONE 
THROUGH LEGISLATION. 
THAT IS WHAT IS NOT ENTIRELY 
CLEAR. 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, SILICON 
VALLEY, THE  THE TECH WORLD 
KNOWS THIS. 
THAT WASHINGTON IS FAIRLY FAR 
BEHIND TECH TRENDS AND STAYING 
AT PACE OR AHEAD OF THESE 
CHANGES. 
SO, EVEN IF THEY WERE TO PASS 
SOMETHING, YOU HAVE TO WONDER 
HOW MUCH WILL IT REALLY STICK 
AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO 
EVOLVE. 
SO I THINK THE LEVEL OF 
SPECIFICITY WE GET WILL BE 
MINIMAL AND IT REMAIN TO BE 
SEEN. 
FRANKLY WHAT WOULD DRIVE THE 
DEBATE IS IF THERE IS SOME 
OTHER REVELATION. 
IS THERE SOME OTHER CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA OUT THERE. 
HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER SIMILAR 
PROBLEMS? 
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL 
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. 
THERE HAS BEEN LEGISLATION 
PROPOSED BUT NO ACTUAL REAL 
MOVEMENT ON IT AND I SUSPECT 
YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE 
SENATORS TODAY TALK ABOUT IT. 
OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND 
TANYA, THIS IS A RARE SIGHT TO 
HAVE 43, 44 SENATORS TOGETHER 
IN A ROOM QUESTIONING ONE 
PERSON. 
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SEE 
IN THE SENATE, BUT YOU HAVE A 
JOINT HEARING HERE OF THE 
SENATE COMMERCE AND THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEES MEANING 
TOGETHER. 
THERE IS SOME OVERLAP. 
FOUR OR FIVE MEMBERS, FOUR OR 
FIVE SENATORS MEMBERS OF BOTH 
COMMITTEES BUT THEY WILL SORT 
OF GO THROUGH HERE. 
BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM HAVE 
JURISDICTION. 
AND THIS HEARING ROOM THEY ARE 
HOLDING IT, 216 IS TAILOR MADE 
FOR THIS. 
THE SKY BOXES ARE BUILT FOR OUR 
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES WHO CAN 
WATCH AND COVER THESE HEARINGS 
AS IF IT IS A TV SPECTACLE 
WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THIS IS 
ABOUT. 
THEY WILL USE THIS AS A CHANCE 
TO YELL AND SCREAM AT 
ZUCKERBERG TO SOME EXPENT. 
SCORE SOME POINTS AND HOPE WE 
WILL REPLAY THE PASSAGES LATER 
ON. 
THEY ARE EITHER UP FOR 
REELECTION THIS YEAR OR 
THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. 
ANY TIME  NAGS NAGS TELEVISION 
IS TUNED IN, THEY WILL PUT ON A 
SHOW. 
>> STRENGTHENING POLITICAL AD 
POLICIES AND ESTABLISHING A 
RESEARCH COMMISSION, IS ALL OF 
THIS ENOUGH TO PLEASE THE 
LAWMAKERS DO YOU THINK, ED? 
>> NO. 
NOT NECESSARILY. 
CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE THOSE 
PLEASED BECAUSE THEY ARE A FAN 
OF SELF-REGULATING BUT OTHERS 
WILL SAY YOU HAVE TO DO MORE, 
YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE YOU 
HAVE MADE CHANGES. 
AND THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT 
THE POLITICAL AD IDENTIFICATION 
LOOKS LIKE. 
IS IT SIMILAR TO A CANDIDATE 
SAYING HE OR SHE APPROVED THIS 
MESSAGE OR IT REVEALED WHICH 
SUPERPAC PAID FOR IT? 
IS IT SAID THROUGH AUDIO? 
WHAT WILL THAT LOOK LIKE? 
I THINK THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW 
MORE ABOUT THAT AS WELL. 
>> THANKS ED. 
WE WILL TALK TO YOU A LITTLE 
LATER. 
WE WILL GO BACK TO OUR 
ILLUSTRIOUS PANEL. 
HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT GETTING 
RID OF THESE APPS. 
THESE APPS ARE NOT GOING TO 
DISAPPEAR, THE APPS THAT 
COLLECT OUR INFORMATION. 
HE IS TALKING ABOUT REGULATING 
THEM AND MAKING SURE THERE IS 
MORE CONTROL OVER THEM. 
BUT WHY ALLOW THE APPS AT ALL? 
ROGER? 
>> WELL, I THINK ONE OF THE 
KEYS TO FACEBOOK'S GROWTH WAS 
THESE APPS. 
FUN LITTLE QUIZZES OR GAMES YOU 
WERE ABLE TO SHARE AND HELP 
CREATE THAT IDEA THAT FEELING 
OF A COMMUNITY IN FACEBOOK. 
GOING BACK TO THE CORE OF 
BUSINESS AND THE FACT THE APPS 
ARE TAKING YOUR DATA, THAT IS 
STILL CRITICAL TO HOW FACEBOOK 
MAKES ITS MONEY. 
IT SAYS IT WANTS TO REGULATE 
ITSELF. 
>> BUT IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN. 
>> I THINK WE NEED BOTH. 
WE NEED BETTER SELF-REGULATION, 
BUT WE NEED REGULATION AT THE 
GOVERNMENT LEVEL. 
DECADES AGO WHEN THE 
ADVERTISING INDUSTRY WAS FACING 
A LOT OF REGULATION, THEY 
FORMED A SELF-REGULATORY 
COUNCIL AND PUTTING FORTH THE 
IDEA THAT BIG SOCIAL TWITTER, 
ú 
ALL OF THEM, SHOULD GET 
TOGETHER AND FORM SOME INDUSTRY 
STANDARDS. 
THAT IS WHAT WE NEED ON THEIR 
END. 
>> IF CONGRESS SAID GREAT, WE 
LIKE FACEBOOK, IT IS NICE, WE 
HAVE A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT, BUT 
GET RID OF THE APPS THAT 
COLLECT PEOPLE'S INFORMATION. 
WOULD THAT DESTROY FACEBOOK? 
>> WELL, IF LAWMAKERS WERE TO 
DO THAT, THAT WOULD HAVE A 
SIGNIFICANTLY ...  
IT WOULD HARM FACEBOOK. 
BUT IT MIGHT NOT HARM FACEBOOK 
LIKE IT WOULD HAVE IN 2011 OR 
2012 AS ROGER MENTIONED. 
ALLOWING   ACCESS TO APPS. 
ZINGA BECAME A MULTIBILLION 
DOLLARS COMPANY ON ITS OWN. 
NOW, THE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT 
THE CORE PART OF FACEBOOK'S 
BUSINESS MODEL. 
THEY SELL ADS TO THE USERS 
INSIDE OF THE NEWS FEED. 
AND THE OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE 
INSTAGRAM AND WHAT'S APP. 
SO IT MIGHT NOT HARM THEM NOW, 
BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN 
EMOTIONAL BLOW. 
>> COULD IT TURN TO A 
SUBSCRIPTION MODEL? 
I STILL HAVE A YAHOO E-MAIL 
ACCOUNT. 
BUT YOU CAN PAY TO OPT OUT OF 
THE ADS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO 
SEE THEM. 
>> THE IDEA OF THE SUBSCRIPTION 
MODEL HAS BEEN BATTED ABOUT. 
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE WANTS TO 
PAY FOR FACEBOOK. 
THE PROBLEM IS, THE PEOPLE TALK 
ABOUT WANTING PRIVACY, BUT 
OFTENTIMES THEY ARE NOT WILLING 
TO PAY FOR IT OR TO REMOVE THE 
CONVENIENCE AFFORDED TO THEM. 
>> AND BEING A FREE SERVICE 
MEANS YOU CAN GET REALLY LARGE. 
THAT IS REALL ...  
THEY WANT IT TO GROW AT ALL 
COSTS. 
>> FROM IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF 
MONEY FOR GOOGLE IN THE 
ENTERPRISE, YOU CAN PAY GOOGLE 
$10 A MONTH AND HAVE AN 
ENTERPRISE ACCOUNT. 
THEY DON'T TRACK YOU IN THE 
SAME WAYS AND YOU DON'T GET 
ADS. 
>> THE  ENTERPRISE IS BUSINESS. 
FACEBOOK FOR WORK HAS NOT 
REALLY FLOWN. 
>> GOOD POINT. 
AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WILL BE ANGRY AT BEING ASKED TO 
PAY FOR THEIR PRIVACY. 
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT DOESN'T 
SIT RIGHT. 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE 
GIVING AWAY A LOT OF 
INFORMATION YOU ARE NOT AWARE 
YOU ARE GIVING AWAY. 
SO, DO YOU THINK THE END 
RESULTS OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT 
NO MATTER WHAT, FACEBOOK IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT A BIG 
CUT IN REVENUE? 
I KNOW I ASKED THIS BEFORE. 
BUT, TO ME, IT SEEMS SO ...  
IT SEEMS SO LINKED THAT GETTING 
RID OF SOME OF THESE APPS 
COLLECTING OUR PRIVACY, 
COLLECTING OUR DATA MEANS 
FACEBOOK IS GOING THE SEE A CUT 
IN REVENUE? 
>> ZUCKERBERG HAS SAID HE IS 
WILLING TO TAKE THAT HIT. 
THOSE ARE GREAT WORDS. 
BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL 
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT IS 
UNCLEAR TO ME. 
>> IN THE LONG RUN, A MORE 
SOUND BUSINESS WILL BE 
ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE COMPANY. 
IF THEY INVEST NOW, SURE, SHORT 
TERM, THEY HAVE TO LOSE A 
LITTLE BIT OF REVENUE. 
BUT IN THE LONG RUN, THEY WILL 
HAVE BETTER SHAREHOLDER 
INVESTMENTS. 
THEY WILL BE BRINGING IN 
PRODUCT AND SELLING OTHER 
THINGS. 
WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THEIR 
BUSINESS MODEL AND THEIR ETHICS 
AROUND US RIGHT NOW. 
>> LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF 
FACEBOOK, WE ALSO HAVE TO ASK 
HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD USE 
IT? 
I SAY THAT BECAUSE MY KIDS 
DON'T USE FACEBOOK. 
GRANTED THEY ARE LITTLE. 
BUT THEY ALL WANT INSTAGRAM 
ACCOUNTS. 
THEY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT 
FACEBOOK. 
>> IT'S IS SAME THING. 
INSTAGRAM IS THE SAME PRODUCT. 
>> IT IS PART OF IT. 
>> BUT YET, THE SHEEN IS OFF OF 
FACEBOOK FOR THE YOUNGER KIDS. 
>> IT HAS BEEN FOR A WHILE. 
SNAP CHAT WAS THE HOT THING FOR 
A WHILE. 
AND I THINK IT TOOK AWAY SOME 
OF THE ATTENTION FROM FACEBOOK. 
BUT FACEBOOK HAS DONE A GOOD 
JOB OF HEDGING ITS BETS. 
IT OWNS A MAJORITY OF THE WAY 
WE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER 
AROUND THE WORLD NOW. 
>> VERY TRUE. 
VERY TRUE. 
SO JEN, DO YOU THINK FACEBOOK 
HAS THE LEGS? 
>> THEY HAVE HIT THE SCALE. 
THEY WILL BE AROUND FOR A WHILE 
SO WE NEED TO PUT SOME SOUND 
REGULATION IN PLACE. 
AND TO SET SOME INDUSTRY 
STANDARDS. 
FACEBOOK IS REALLY THE ELEPHANT 
IN THE ROOM. 
WE NEED THEM TO BE LEADERS IN 
THIS SPACE. 
>> NOW, IF CONGRESS SAYS ALL 
RIGHT, WE NEED SOME REGULATION, 
MR. ZUCKERBERG WILL YOU LEAD 
THE TEAM IN CREATING 
REGULATION? 
THAT IS WHAT HE IS HOPING FOR 
RIGHT? 
HE HAS INTIMATED HE BELIEVES 
THERE NEED TO BE REGULATION AND 
HE IS OPEN TO IT BUT HE WANTS 
TO BE THE ONE IN CONTROL. 
>> HE SURELY HAS LOBBYISTS 
WRITING THE ACTUAL LEGISLATION 
AND TAKE IT TO THE HILL AND 
HAND IT OVER. 
THERE WILL BE AGREEMENTS BEFORE 
THIS GETS PUT FORTH. 
>> IS THAT LIKELY TO HAPPEN 
THAT CONGRESS WILL ACCEPT HIS 
VERSION OF REGULATIONS? 
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS LIKELY 
CONGRESS WILL ACCEPT THE THINGS 
FACEBOOK WANTS TO DO SIMPLY 
BECAUSE CONGRESS DOESN'T HAVE 
THE TECH UNDERSTANDING TO 
REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NUTS AND 
BOLTS OF WHAT FACEBOOK SELF-
REGULATION WOULD LOOK LIKE. 
BUT, ONE THING THAT IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS 
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO 
UNDERSTAND THE TECH NUTS AND 
BOLTS IN  ORDER TO HAVE YOUR 
PRIVACY PROTECTED AND WHETHER 
YOU ARE TECH SAVVY OR NOT, 
THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS. 
GOING BACK TO WHAT  MR. COOKE 
AND THE UNITED NATIONS SAID. 
IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN 
RIGHT. 
>>  MR. ZUCKERBERG HAS ENTERED 
THE ROOM. 
HE LOOKS A LITTLE NERVOUS. 
I WOULD TOO. 
HE IS ABOUT TO FACE A PUBLIC 
GRILLING WHICH WILL BE 
UNCOMFORTABLE AT TIMES I'M 
SURE. 
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK IN TERMS 
OF HIS TONE? 
HE HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A 
REPUTATION OF BEING ARROGANT IN 
THE PAST. 
CORRECT? 
O HOW IMPORTANT IS HIS TONE 
HERE ROGER? 
>> IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. 
HE WILL NEED TO SHOW 
CONTRITION. 
SHOW SOME HUMILITY. 
AND, HE HASN'T BEEN THAT GREAT 
AT COMMUNICATING. 
HE HAS OFTEN BEEN TONE DEAF AT 
COMMUNICATING HIS POINTS. 
SO HE HAS TO GET PAST THAT. 
>> WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN GET A 
GOOD SHOT OF HIM ONCE THE STILL 
PHOTOGRAPHERS. 
>> A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN 
FACEBOOK LIVE ISN'T IT? 
>> IT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
INDEED. 
YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT. 
FACEBOOK HAS SO MANY 
INITIATIVES. 
FACEBOOK LIVE. 
IT IS FINDING A WAY TO HAVE NEW 
REVENUE STREAMS. 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF NEW 
DIRECTIONS THAT IT IS FEELING 
OUT. 
>> THEY WANT EVERYTHING TO GO 
TO LIVE VIDEO. 
THEN ALL THE MURDERS GETTING 
CAPTURED ON FILM. 
ALL OF THESE TERRIBLE 
CONSEQUENCES THEY NEVER THOUGHT 
ABOUT. 
THEY HAVE HAD TO BACK OFF. 
THAT HAS BEEN THEIR HISTORY. 
THE CYCLE OF PUTTING OUT NEW 
FEATURES AND THEN DEALING WITH 
THE CONSEQUENCES. 
>> FACEBOOK LIVE IS A PERFECT 
EXAMPLE OF THE HARM THAT CAN 
OCCUR, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, 
FACEBOOK GOING COUNTER TO WHAT 
THE NARRATIVE MAY BE. 
THEY HIT 3.5 MILLION STREAMS ON 
FACEBOOK LIVE. 
>> I HATE TO CUT YOU OFF. 
BUT MARK ZUCKERBERG IS 
BEGINNING TO SPEAK SO LET'S 
LISTEN IN. 
>> SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY AND THE 
USE AND ABUSE OF DATA. 
THOUGH NOT UNPRECEDENTED, THIS 
IS A UNIQUE HEARING. 
THE ISSUES WE WILL CONSIDER 
RANGE FROM DATA PRIVACY AND 
SECURITY TO CONSUMER PROTECTION 
AND THE FEDERAL TRADE 
COMMISSION ENFORCEMENT TOUCHING 
ON JURISDICTIONS OF THESE TWO 
COMMITTEES. 
WE HAVE 44 MEMBERS BETWEEN OUR 
TWO COMMITTEES. 
THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LARGE 
GROUP IN FACEBOOK STANDARDS BUT 
IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR A HEARING 
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. 
WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO KEEP 
THINGS MOVING EFFICIENTLY GIVEN 
OUR CIRCUMSTANCES. 
WE WILL BEGIN WITH OPENING 
STATEMENTS FROM THE CHAIRMAN 
AND RANKING MEMBERS OF EACH 
COMMITTEE STARTING WITH 
CHAIRMAN THUN. 
THEN PROCEEDING WITH  MR. 
ZUCKERBERG'S OPENING STATEMENT. 
WE WILL THEN MOVE ONTO 
QUESTIONING. 
EACH MEMBER WILL HAVE FIVE 
MEMBERS TO QUESTION WITNESSES 
I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE 
MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES THAT 
TIME LIMITS WILL BE AND MUSTILY 
STRICTLY ENFORCED GIVEN THE 
NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE HERE 
TODAY. 
IF YOU ARE OVER YOUR TIME, THE 
CHAIRMAN AND I WILL MAKE SURE 
TO LET YOU KNOW. 
THERE WILL NOT BE A SECOND 
ROUND AS WELL. 
THERE WILL BE THE USUAL FOLLOW 
UP WRITTEN QUESTIONS FOR THE 
RECORD. 
QUESTIONING WILL ALTERNATE 
BETWEEN MAJORITY AND MINORITY 
BETWEEN COMMITTEES. 
WE WILL PROCEED IN ORDER BASED 
ON RESPECTIVE COMMITTEE 
SENIORITY. 
WE WILL ANTICIPATE A COUPLE OF 
SHORT BREAKS LATER IN THE 
AFTERNOON. 
AND, SO, IT IS MY PLEASURE TO 
RECOGNIZE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
COMMERCE COMMITTEE FOR HIS 
OPENING STATEMENT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
TODAY'S HEAR SERGEANT 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY TO HOLD A 
JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING. 
IT IS MORE EXTRAORDINARY TO 
HAVE A SINGLE CEO TESTIFY 
BEFORE NEARLY HALF OF THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE. 
BUT THEN FACEBOOK IS PRETTY 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
MORE THAN TWO BILLION PEOPLE 
USE FACEBOOK EVERY MONTH. 
1.4BILLION PEOPLE USE IT EVERY 
DAY. 
MORE THAN THE POPULATION OF ANY 
COUNTRY ON EARTH EXCEPT CHINA, 
AND MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE 
POPULATION OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
IT IS ALSO MORE THAN 1500 TIMES 
THE POPULATION OF MY HOME STATE 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA. 
PLUS, ROUGHLY 45% OF AMERICAN 
ADULTS REPORT GETTING AT LEAST 
SOME OF THEIR NEWS FROM 
FACEBOOK. 
IN MANY RESPECTS, FACEBOOK'S 
INCREDIBLE REACH IS WHY WE ARE 
HERE TODAY. 
WE ARE HEAR BECAUSE OF WHAT 
YOU,  MR. ZUCKERBERG HAS 
DESCRIBED AS A BREACH OF TRUST. 
A QUIZ APP USED BY 
APPROXIMATELY 300,000 PEOPLE 
LED TO INFORMATION ABOUT 87 
MILLION FACEBOOK USERS BEING 
OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA AND WE EXPECT TO HOLD 
A FUTURE HEARING ON THEM AND 
SIMILAR FIRMS. 
BUT, AS YOU HAVE SAID, THIS IS 
NOT LIKELY TO BE AN ISOLATED 
INCIDENT. 
A FACT DEMONSTRATED BY 
FACEBOOK'S SUSPENSION OF 
ANOTHER FIRM LATER IN WEEKEND. 
YOU PROMISED WHEN FACEBOOK 
FOUND OTHER APPS WITH ACCESS TO 
HUGE AMOUNTS OF USER DATA, YOU 
WILL BAN THEM AND TELL THOSE 
AFFECTED AND THAT IS 
APPROPRIATE BUT IT IS NOT 
LIKELY TO BE ENOUGH FOR THE 
FACEBOOK USERS. 
ONE REASON SO MANY PEOPLE ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IS 
BECAUSE OF WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT 
HOW IT WORKS. 
THE IDEA FOR EVERY PERSON WHO 
DECIDED TO TRY AN APP. 
INFORMATION ABOUT 300 OTHER 
PEOPLE WAS SCRAPED FROM YOUR 
SERVICES TO PUT IT MILDLY. 
DISTURBING. 
AND, THE FACT THOSE 87 MILLION 
PEOPLE MAY HAVE TECHNICALLY 
CONSENTED TO MAKING THEIR DATA 
AVAILABLE DOESN'T MAKE PEOPLE 
FEEL ANY BETTER. 
THE REVELATION THAT MALICIOUS 
ACTORS WERE ABLE TO USE 
FACEBOOK'S DEFAULT SETTINGS TO 
MATCH E-MAIL ADDRESSES AND 
PHONE NUMBERS ON THE DARK WEB 
TO PUBLIC FACEBOOK PROFILES 
POTENTIALLY AFFECTING ALL 
FACEBOOK USERS ONLY ADDS FUEL 
TO THE FIRE. 
WHAT BINDS THE TWO INCIDENTS IS 
THEY DON'T APPEAR TO BE CAUSED 
BY THE KIND OF NEGLIGENCE THAT 
CAUSING TYPICAL DATA BREACHES 
TO HAPPEN. 
INSTEAD, THEY BOTH APPEAR TO BE 
THE RESULT OF PEOPLE EXPLOITING 
THE VERY TOOLS YOU HAVE CREATED 
TO MANIPULATE USER INFORMATION. 
I KNOW FACEBOOK HAS TAKEN 
SEVERAL STEPS AND INTENDS TO 
TAKE MORE TO ADDRESS THESE 
ISSUES. 
NEVERTHELESS, SOME HAVE WARNED 
THE ACTIONS FACEBOOK IS TAKING 
TO ENSURE THIRD PARTIES DON'T 
OBTAIN DATA, WHILE NECESSARY, 
WILL ALSO ALLOW FACEBOOK TO 
MARKET SUCH DATA EXCLUSIVELY. 
MOST OF US UNDERSTAND WHETHER 
YOU ARE USING FACEBOOK OR 
GOOGLE OR SOME OTHER ONLINE 
SERVICE, WE ARE TRADING CERTAIN 
INFORMATION ABOUT OURSELVES FOR 
FREE OR LOW COST SERVICES BUT 
FOR THIS MODEL TO PERSIST, BOTH 
SIDES OF THE BARGAINED TO KNOW 
THE STAKES INVOLVED. 
RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT CONVINCED 
THAT FACEBOOK'S USERS HAVE THE 
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE 
MEANINGFUL CHOICES. 
IN THE PAST, MANY OF MY 
COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 
AISLE HAVE BEEN WILLING TO 
DEFER TO TECH COMPANY'S EFFORTS 
TO REGULATE THEMSELVES. 
BUT, THIS MAY BE CHANGING. 
JUST LAST MONTH, ABOUT 
OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN 
FASHION, CONGRESS VOTED TO MAKE 
IT EASIER FOR PROSECUTORS AND 
VICTIMS TO GO AFTER WEBSITES 
THAT KNOWINGLY FACILITATE SEX 
TRAFFICKING. 
THIS HUMAN  SHOULD BE A WAKEUP 
CALL TO THE TECH COMPANY. 
WE WANT TO HEAR MORE WITHOUT 
DELAY ON WHAT FAST  -- FASTBOOK 
FACEBOOK AND OTHER COMPANIES 
INTEND TO DO. 
HOW WILL YOU INFORM USERS ABOUT 
THE CHANGES YOU ARE MAKING AND 
HOW TO DO YOU INTEND TO STOP 
HARMFUL CONDUCT? 
IN MANY WAYS YOU AND THE 
COMPANY YOU HAVE CREATED, THE 
STORY YOU CREATED REPRESENT THE 
AMERICAN DREAM. 
MANY ARE INCREDIBLY INSPIRED BY 
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. 
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE AN 
OBLIGATION AND IT IS UP TO YOU 
TO MAKE SURE THAT DREAM DOESN'T 
BECOME A PRIVACY NIGHTMARE FOR 
THE SCORES OF PEOPLE WHO USE 
FACEBOOK. 
THIS HEARING IS AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO SPEAK TO THOSE WHO HAVE USED 
FACEBOOK AND THOSE WHO ARE 
DEEPICALLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT. 
WE ARE LISTENING, AMERICA IS 
LISTENING, AND QUITE POSSIBLY, 
THE WORLD IS LISTENING TOO. 
>> THANK YOU. 
NOW, RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH  MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU BOTH FOR HOLDING THIS 
HEARING. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANK YOU FOR 
BEING HERE, YOU HAVE A REAL 
OPPORTUNITY THIS AFTERNOON TO 
LEAD THE INDUSTRY AND 
DEMONSTRATE A MEANINGFUL 
COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING 
PRIVACY. 
WE HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL 
THAT IS ALARMING THE PAST FEW 
MONTHS. 
WE HAVE SEEN HOW FOREIGN ACTORS 
ARE ABUSING SOCIAL MEDIA 
PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK TO 
INTERFERE IN ELECTIONS AND TAKE 
MILLIONS OF AMERICAN' PERSONAL 
INFORMATION WITHOUT THEIR 
KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER TO 
MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND 
TARGET INDIVIDUAL VOTERS. 
SPECIFICALLY, ON  FEBRUARY 
16th, SPECIAL COUNCIL MUELLER 
ISSUED AN INDICTMENT AGAINST 
THE RUSSIA BASED INTERNET 
RESEARCH AGENCY. 
AND 13 OF ITS EMPLOYEES FOR 
INTERFERING OPERATIONS 
TARGETING THE UNITED STATES. 
THROUGH THIS 37 PAGE 
INDICTMENT, WE LEARNED THE IRA 
RAN A COORDINATED CAMPAIGN 
THROUGH 470 FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS 
AND PAGES. 
THE CAMPAIGN INCLUDED ADS AND 
FALSE INFORMATION TO CREATE 
DISCORD AND HARM SECRETARY 
CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN AND THE 
CONTENT WAS SEEN BY AN 
ESTIMATED 157 MILLION 
AMERICANS. 
A MONTH LATER, ON MARCH 17, 
NEWS BROKE THAT CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA EXPLOITED THE 
PERSONAL INFORMATION OF 
APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION 
FACEBOOK USERS WITHOUT THEIR 
KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION. 
AND, LAST WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT 
NUMBER WAS EVEN HIGHER. 
87MILLION FACEBOOK USERS WHO 
HAD THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION 
TAKEN WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. 
SPECIFICALLY, USING A 
PERSONALITY QUIZ HE CREATED, 
PROFESSOR COGAN COLLECTED THE 
INFORMATION OF 300,000 FACEBOOK 
USERS. 
AND THEN, COLLECTED DATA ON 
MILLIONS OF THEIR FRIENDS. 
IT APPEARS THE INFORMATION 
COLLECTED INCLUDED EVERYTHING 
THESE INDIVIDUALS HAD ON THEIR 
FACEBOOK PAGES. 
ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, EVEN 
INCLUDED PRIVATE DIRECT 
MESSAGES BETWEEN USERS. 
PROFESSOR COGAN IS SAID TO HAVE 
TAKEN DATA FROM 70 MILLION 
AMERICANS. 
IT IS ALSO REPORTED HE SOLD 
THIS DATA TO CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA FOR $800,000. 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA TOOK THIS 
DATA AND CREATED A 
PSYCHOLOGICAL WELFARE TOOL TO 
INFLUENCE UNITED STATES 
ELECTIONS. 
IN FACT, THE CEO, ALEXANDER 
NICKS, DECLARED CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA RAN ALL THE DIGITAL 
CAMPAIGN, THE TELEVISION 
CAMPAIGN AND ITS DATA. 
FORMED ALL THE STRATEGY FOR THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 
THE REPORTING HAS ALSO 
SPECULATED THAT CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA WORKED WITH THE 
INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY TO 
HELP RUSSIA IDENTIFY WHICH 
AMERICANS TO TARGET WITH ITS 
PROPAGANDA. 
I'M CONCERNED PRESS REPORTS 
INDICATE FACEBOOK LEARNED ABOUT 
THIS BREACH IN 2015. 
BUT APPEARS NOT TO HAVE TAKEN 
SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO ADDRESS IT 
UNTIL THIS YEAR, SO, THIS 
HEARING IS IMPORTANT. 
AND I APPRECIATE THE 
CONVERSATION WE HAD YESTERDAY. 
AND I BELIEVE THAT FACEBOOK 
THROUGH YOUR PRESENCE HERE 
TODAY AND THE WORDS YOU ARE 
ABOUT TO TELL US WOULD INDICATE 
HOW STRONGLY YOUR INDUSTRY WILL 
REGULATE AND OR REFORM THE 
PLATFORMS THEY CONTROL. 
I BELIEVE THIS IS 
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. 
YOU LEAD A BIG COMPANY WITH 
27,000 EMPLOYEES. 
AND, WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD 
TO YOUR COMMENTS. 
THANK YOU  MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THANK YOU SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
THE HISTORY AND GROWTH OF 
FACEBOOK MIRRORS THAT OF MANY 
OF OUR TECHNOLOGICAL GIANTS. 
FOUNDED BY  MR. ZUCKERBERG IN 
2004, FACEBOOK HAS EXPLODED 
OVER THE PAST 14 YEARS. 
FACEBOOK CURRENTLY HAS OVER 2 
BILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS 
ACROSS THE WORLD. 
OVER 25,000 EMPLOYEES, AND 
OFFICES IN VARIOUS OTHER CITIES 
AND COUNTRIES. 
LIKE THEIR EXPANDING USER BASE, 
THE DATA COLLECTED ON FACEBOOK 
USERS HAS ALSO SKYROCKETED. 
THEY HAVE MOVED ON FROM 
SCHOOLS, LIKES, AND 
RELATIONSHIPS STATUSES TODAY, 
FACEBOOK HAS ACCESS TO DOZENS 
OF DATA POINTS RANGING FROM ADS 
THAT YOU HAVE CLICKED ON. 
EVENTS YOU HAVE ATTENDED AND 
YOUR LOCATION BASED ON YOUR 
POSSIBLY DEVICE. 
FACEBOOK MAKES MONEY OFF THAT 
DAY FROM FROM ADVERTISING 
REVENUE THOUGH MANY SEEM 
CONFUSED BY OR ALTOGETHER 
UNAWARE OF THIS FACT. 
FACEBOOK GENERATES 40 BILLION 
IN REVENUE IN 2017. 
WITH ABOUT 98% COMING FROM 
ADVERTISING ACROSS FACEBOOK. 
AND INSTAGRAM. 
SIGNIFICANT DATA COLLECTION IS 
ALSO OCCURRING AT GOOGLE. 
TWITTER, APPLE. 
AND AMAZON. 
AND, EVEN AN EVER EXPANDING 
PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND 
SERVICES OFFERED BY THESE 
COMPANIES GRANT ENDLESS 
OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLECT 
INCREASING AMOUNTS OF 
INFORMATION ON THEIR CUSTOMERS. 
AS WE GET MORE FREE OR 
EXTREMELY LOW COST SERVICES, 
THE TRADE-OFF FOR THE AMERICAN 
CONSUMER IS TO PROVIDE MORE 
PERSONAL DATA. 
THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER 
GROWTH AND INNOVATION BASED ON 
COLLECTION OF DATA IS 
LIMITLESS. 
HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL FOR 
ABUSE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT. 
WHILE THE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
SITUATION IS COMING TO LIGHT, 
THERE WAS A BREACH OF CONSUMER 
TRUST AND IMPROPER TRANSFER OF 
DATA. 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL 
HOLD A SEPARATE DATA EXPLORING 
CAMBRIDGE AND OTHER DATA 
PRIVACY ISSUES. 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THOUGH, THESE 
EVENTS HAVE IGNITED A LARGER 
DISCUSSION ON CONSUMERS, 
EXPECTATIONS, AND, THE FUTURE 
OF DATA PRIVACY IN OUR SOCIETY. 
IT IS EXPOSED THAT CONSUMERS 
MAY NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND OR 
APPRECIATE THE EXPENT TO WHICH 
THEIR DATA IS COLLECTED, 
PROTECTED, TRANSFERRED, USED, 
AND MISUSED. 
DATA HAS BEEN USED IN 
ADVERTISING AND POLITICAL 
CAMPAIGNS FOR DECADES. 
THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF DATA 
OBTAINED, HOWEVER, HAS SEEN A 
VERY DRAMATIC CHANGE. 
CAMPAIGNS INCLUDING PRESIDENT'S 
BUSH, OBAMA, AND TRUMP ALL USE 
THESE INCREASING AMOUNTS OF 
DATA TO FOCUS ON MICRO 
TARGETING AND PERSONALIZATION 
OVER NUMEROUS PLATFORMS AND 
FACEBOOK. 
IN FACT, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
CAMPAIGN DEVELOPED AN APP 
UTILIZING THE SAME FACEBOOK 
FEATURE AS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
TO CAPTURE THE INFORMATION OF 
NOT JUST THE APPS USERS BUT 
MILLIONS OF THEIR FRIENDS. 
THE DIGITAL DIRECTOR FOR THAT 
CAMPAIGN FOR 2012 DESCRIBED THE 
APP AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD 
WIND UP BEING THE MOST GROUND 
BREAKING PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY 
DEVELOPED FOR THIS CAMPAIGN. 
SO, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE 
SOCIAL MEDIA TACTICS CAN BE 
DEBATED SO THEIR USE OVER THE 
PAST YEARS ACROSS THE POLITICAL 
SPECTRUM AND THEIR INCREASED 
SIGNIFICANCE CANNOT BE IGNORED. 
OUR POLICY TOWARD DATA PRIVACY 
AND SECURITY MUST KEEP PACE 
WITH THESE CHANGES. 
DATA PRIVACY SHOULD BE TETHERED 
TO CONSUMER NEEDS AND 
EXPECTATIONS. 
NOW, AT A MINIMUM, CONSUMERS 
MUST HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY 
NECESSARY TO MAKE AN INFORMED 
DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO SHARE 
THEIR DATA AND HOW IT CAN BE 
USED. 
CONSUMERS OUGHT TO HAVE CLEAR 
INFORMATION. 
NOT OPAQUE POLICIES AND COMPLEX 
CLICK THROUGH CONSENT PAGES. 
THE TECH INDUSTRY HAS AN 
OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO 
WIDESPREAD AND GROWING CONCERNS 
OVER DATA PRIVACY. 
AND, SECURITY, AND TO RESTORE 
THE PUBLIC'S TRUST. 
THE STATUS QUO NO LONGER WORKS. 
MOREOVER, CONGRESS MUST 
DETERMINE IF AND HOW WE NEED TO 
STRENGTHEN PRIVACY STANDARDS TO 
ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND 
UNDERSTANDING FOR THE BILLIONS 
OF USERS TO UTILIZE THESE 
PRODUCTS. 
SENATOR NELSON. 
>> THANK YOU  MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, GOOD AFTERNOON. 
LET ME JUST CUT TO THE CHASE. 
IF YOU AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA 
COMPANIES DO NOT GET YOUR ACT 
IN ORDER, NONE OF US ARE GOING 
TO HAVE ANY PRIVACY ANYMORE 
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FACING. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PERSONALLY 
IDENTIFYABLE INFORMATION THAT 
IF NOT KEPT BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA 
COMPANIES FROM THEFT, A VALUE 
THAT WE HAVE IN AMERICA BEING 
OUR PERSONAL PRIVACY, WE WON'T 
HAVE IT ANYMORE. 
IT'S THE ADVENT OF TECHNOLOGY. 
AND, OF COURSE, ALL OF US ARE A 
PART OF IT. 
FROM THE MOMENT THAT WE WAKE UP 
IN THE MORNING UNTIL WE GO TO 
BED, WE ARE ON THOSE HAND HELD 
TABLETS. 
AND, ONLINE COMPANIES LIKE 
FACEBOOK ARE TRACKING OUR 
ACTIVITIES AND COLLECTING 
INFORMATION. 
FACEBOOK HAS A RESPONSIBILITY 
TO PROTECT THIS PERSONAL 
INFORMATION. 
WE HAD A GOODIES CUSHION 
YESTERDAY. 
WE WENT OVER ALL OF THIS. 
YOU TOLD ME THE COMPANY HAD 
FAILED TO DO SO. 
IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME 
FACEBOOK HAS MISHANDLED ITS 
USERS INFORMATION. 
THE FTC FOUND THAT FACEBOOK'S 
PRIVACY POLICIES HAD DECEIVED 
USERS IN THE PAST. 
AND IN THE PRESENT CASE, WE 
RECOGNIZE THAT CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA AND AN APP DEVELOPER 
LIED TO CONSUMERS AND LIED TO 
YOU, LIED TO FACEBOOK. 
BUT, DID FACEBOOK WATCH OVER 
THE OPERATIONS? 
AND WHY DIDN'T FACEBOOK NOTIFY 
87 MILLION USERS THAT THEIR 
PERSONALLY IDENTIFYABLE 
INFORMATION HAD BEEN TAKEN AND 
WAS ALSO BEING USED? 
WHY WERE THEY NOT INFORMED FOR 
UNAUTHORIZED POLITICAL 
PURPOSES? 
SO, ONLY NOW, AND I APPRECIATE 
OUR CONVERSATION, ONLY NOW, 
FACEBOOK HAS PLEDGED TO INFORM 
THOSE CONSUMERS WHOSE ACCOUNTS 
WERE COMPROMISED. 
I THINK YOU ARE GENUINE. 
I GOT THAT SENSE IN CONVERSING 
WITH YOU. 
YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 
YOU WANT TO ENACT REFORMS. 
WE WANT TO KNOW IF IT IS GOING 
TO BE ENOUGH. 
AND I HOPE THAT WILL BE IN THE 
ANSWERS TODAY. 
NOW, SINCE WE STILL DON'T KNOW 
WHAT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA HAS 
DONE WITH THIS DATA, YOU HEARD 
THE CHAIRMAN SAY AS WE HAVE 
DISCUSSED, WE WANT TO HAUL 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA IN TO 
ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN A 
SEPARATE HEARING. 
I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN THUN 
FOR WORKING WITH ALL OF US ON 
SCHEDULING A HEARING. 
THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT DEAL 
OF INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT. 
I HOPE WE CAN GET TO THE BOTTOM 
OF THIS. 
IF FACEBOOK AND OTHER ONLINE 
COMPANIES WILL NOT OR CANNOT FIX
THIS. 
HOW CAN WE TRUST FOLKS OF YOUR 
COMPANY TO BE CARETAKERS OF OUR 
MOST PERSONAL OR IDENTIFYABLE 
INFORMATION? 
>> THANK YOU MY COLLEAGUES AND 
SENATOR NELSON. 
>>> OUR WITNESS TODAY IS MARK 
ZUCKERBERG. 
FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF FACEBOOK. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG LAUNCHED 
FACEBOOK FEBRUARY 4, 2004 AT 
THE AGE OF 19. 
AND AT THAT TIME, HE WAS A 
STUDENT AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY. 
THE COMPANY NOW HAS OVER 40 
BILLION OF ANNUAL REVENUE AND 
OVER 2 BILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE 
USERS. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, ALONG WITH HIS 
WIFE ALSO ESTABLISHED THE CHAN 
ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE TO 
FURTHER PHILANTHROPIC CAUSES. 
I TURN TO YOU, WELCOME TO THE 
COMMITTEE. 
AND WHATEVER YOUR STATEMENT IS 
IF YOU HAVE A LONGER ONE. 
IT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE 
RECORD. 
SO PROCEED, SIR. 
>> CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY, CHAIRMAN 
THUN, RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN, 
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. 
WE FACE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT 
ISSUES AROUND PRIVACY, SAFETY, 
AND DEMOCRACY. 
AND, YOU WILL RIGHTFULLY HAVE 
SOME HARD QUESTIONS FOR ME TO 
ANSWER. 
BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE STEPS 
WE ARE TAKING TO ADDRESS THEM, 
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT 
HERE. 
FACEBOOK IS AN IDEALISTIC AND 
OPTIMISTIC COMPANY. 
FOR MOST OF  OUR  EXISTENCE, WE 
FOCUSED ON THE GOOD IT COULD 
DO. 
PEOPLE HAVE A TOOL TO STAY 
CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE THEY 
LOVE. 
FOR MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD 
AND BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND 
BUSINESSES. 
JUST RECENTLY, WE HAVE SEEN THE 
ME TOO MOVEMENT AND THE MARCH 
FOR OUR LIVES ORGANIZED AT 
LEAST IN PART ON FACEBOOK. 
AFTER HURRICANE HARVEY, PEOPLE 
CAME TOGETHER TO RAISE MORE 
THAN $20 MILLION FOR RELIEF. 
AND, MORE THAN 70 MILLION SMALL 
BUSINESSES USE FACEBOOK TO 
CREATE JOBS AND GROW. 
BUT, IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT WE 
DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO PREVENT 
THESE TOOLS FROM BEING USED FOR 
HARM AS WELL. 
THAT GOES FOR FAKE NEWS, FOR 
FOREIGN  INTERFERENCE AND HATE 
SPEECH. 
WE DIDN'T TAKE A BROAD ENOUGH 
VIEW OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND 
THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. 
AND IT WAS MY MISTAKE AND I'M 
SORRY. 
I STARTED FACEBOOK, I RUN IT. 
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 
HAPPENS HERE. 
SO NOW, WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
ALL OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 
PEOPLE AND MAKE SURE WE ARE 
TAKING A BROAD ENOUGH VIEW OF 
OUR RESPONSIBILITY. 
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST 
CONNECT PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE 
CONNECTIONS ARE POSITIVE. 
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST GIVE 
PEOPLE A VOICE. 
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE 
NOT USING IT TO HARM OTHER 
PEOPLE OR TO SPREAD 
MISINFORMATION. 
AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST 
GIVE PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THEIR 
INFORMATION. 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE 
DEVELOPERS THEY SHARE IT WITH 
PROTECT THEIR INFORMATION TOO. 
ACROSS THE BOARD, WE HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT JUST 
BUILD TOOLS, BUT, TO MAKE SURE 
THEY ARE USED FOR GOOD. 
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO WORK 
THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES WE NEED 
TO MAKE ACROSS THE COMPANY, BUT 
I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING THIS 
RIGHT. 
THIS INCLUDES THE BASIC 
RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING 
PEOPLE'S INFORMATION WHICH WE 
FAILED TO DO WITH CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA. 
SO, HERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT 
WE ARE DOING TO ADDRESS THIS 
AND TO PREVENT IT FROM 
HAPPENING AGAIN. 
FIRST, WE ARE GETTING TO THE 
BOTTOM OF WHAT CAMBRIDE 
ANALYTICA DID AND TELLING 
EVERYONE AFFECTED. 
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THEY 
IMPROPERLY ACCESSED INFORMATION 
ABOUT MILLIONS OF FACEBOOK 
MEMBERS BY BUYING IT FROM AN 
APP DEVELOPER. 
THAT INFORMATION, THIS WAS 
INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE 
GENERALLY SHARE PUBLICLY ON 
THEIR FACEBOOK PAGES LIKE 
NAMES, AND THEIR PROFILE 
PICTURE AND THE PAGES THEY 
FOLLOW. 
WHEN WE FIRST CONTACTED 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, THEY TOLD 
US THAT THEY HAD DELETED THE 
DATA. 
ABOUT A MONTH AGO, WE HEARD NEW 
REPORTS THAT SUGGESTED THAT 
WASN'T TRUE. 
AND NOW, WE ARE WORKING WITH 
GOVERNMENTS IN THE U.S., THE 
U.K., AND AROUND THE WORLD TO 
DO A FULL AUDIT OF WHAT THEY 
HAVE DONE AND TO MAKE SURE THEY 
GET RID OF ANY DATA THEY MAY 
STILL HAVE. 
SECOND, TO MAKE SURE NO OTHER 
APP DEVELOPERS OUT THERE ARE 
MISUSING DATA, WE WILL NOW 
INVESTIGATE EVERY SINGLE APP 
THAT HAD ACCESS TO A LARGE 
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE 
PAST. 
AND IF WE FIND THAT SOMEONE 
IMPROPERLY USED DATA, WE WILL 
BAN THEM FROM FACEBOOK AND TELL 
EVERYONE AFFECTED. 
THIRD, TO PREVENT THIS FROM 
EVER HAPPENING AGAIN GOING 
FORWARD, WE ARE MAKING SURE 
THAT DEVELOPERS CAN ACCESS AS 
MUCH INFORMATION NOW. 
CAN'T ACCESS AS MUCH 
INFORMATION NOW. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE ALREADY 
MADE BIG CHANGES TO OUR 
PLATFORM IN 2014 THAT WOULD 
HAVE PREVENTED THIS SPECIFIC 
SITUATION WITH CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA FROM OCCURRING AGAIN 
TODAY. 
BUT, THERE IS MORE TO DO. 
AND, YOU CAN FIND MORE DETAILS 
IN MY WRITTEN STATEMENT. 
MY TOP PRIORITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
OUR SOCIAL MISSION. 
OF CONNECTIN PEOPLE, BUILDING 
COMMUNITY, AND BRINGING THE 
WORLD CLOSER TOGETHER. 
ADVERTISERS AND DEVELOPERS WILL 
NEVER TAKE PRIORITY OVER THAT 
AS LONG AS I AM RUNNING 
FACEBOOK. 
I STARTED FACEBOOK WHEN I WAS 
IN COLLEGE. 
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE 
THEN. 
WE NOW SERVE MORE THAN 2 
BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE 
WORLD. 
AND EVERY DAY, PEOPLE USE OUR 
SERVICES TO STAY CONNECTED WITH 
THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER TO THEM 
THE MOST. 
I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN WHAT WE ARE 
DOING. 
AND I KNOW THAT WHEN WE ADDRESS 
THESE CHALLENGES, WE WILL LOOK 
BACK AND VIEW HELPING PEOPLE 
CONNECT AND GIVING MORE PEOPLE 
A VOICE AS A POSITIVE FORCE IN 
THE WORLD. 
I REALIZE THE ISSUES WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT TODAY ARE NOT 
JUST ISSUES FOR FACEBOOK IN OUR 
COMMUNITY, BUT ISSUES FOR ALL 
OF US AS AMERICANS. 
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE 
TODAY AND I'M READY TO TAKE 
YOUR QUESTION. 
>> LY REMIND MEMBERS WHO 
WEREN'T HERE WHEN I HAD OPENING 
COMMENTS THAT WE ARE OPERATING 
UNDER THE FIVE MINUTE RULE AND 
THAT APPLIES TO ... 
 THE FIVE MINUTE 
RULE, AND THAT APPLIES TO THOSE 
OF US CHAIRING THE COMMITTEE AS 
WELL. 
I WILL START WITH YOU. 
FACEBOOK HANDLES EXTENSIVE 
AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL DATA FOR 
BILLIONS OF USERS. 
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THAT 
DATA IS SHARED WITH THIRD PARTY 
DEVELOPERS WHO UTILIZE YOUR 
PLATFORM. 
AS OF EARLY THIS YEAR, YOU DID 
NOT ACTIVELY MONITOR WHETHER 
THAT DATA WAS TRANSFERRED BY 
SUCH DEVELOPERS TO OTHER 
PARTIES. 
PARTIES SEEKING TO PROFIT FROM 
SUCH DATA. 
NUMBER ONE, BESIDES PROFESSOR 
COGAN'S TRANSFER AND NOW CUBE 
U, DO YOU KNOW OF ANY INSTANCES 
WHERE USER DATA WAS IMPROPERLY 
TRANSFERRED TO THIRD PARTY IN 
BREACH OF FACEBOOK'S TERMS? 
INVESTIGATION INTO EVERY 
HAPPENED THAT HAD A LARGE 
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. 
TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM 
ACCESSING THIS INFORMATION IN 
2014. 
WE BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO BE 
INVESTIGATING MANY APPS, TENS 
OF THOUSANDS OF APPS. 
AND IF WE FIND ANY SUSPICIOUS 
ACTIVITY, WE ARE GOING TO 
CONDUCT A FULL AUDIT OF THOSE 
APPS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE 
USING THEIR DATA AND IF THEY 
ARE DOING ANYTHING IMPROPER. 
IF WE FIND THEY ARE DOING 
ANYTHING IMPROPER, WE WILL BAN 
THEM FROM FACEBOOK AND TELL 
EVERYONE AFFECTED. 
AS FOR PAST ACTIVITY, I DON'T 
HAVE ALL OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE 
APPS THAT WE HAVE BANNED, BUT 
IF YOU WOULD LIKE, I CAN HAVE 
MY TEAM FOLLOW-UP AFTER THIS. 
> HAVE YOU EVER INQUIRED AN 
AUDIT TO ASSURE THE PROPER 
DELETION OF DATA? 
AND IF SO, HOW MANY TIMES? 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YES WE HAVE. 
I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT FIGURE 
ON HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE. 
OVERALL, THE WAY WE HAVE 
ENFORCED OUR PLATFORM POLICIES 
IN THE PAST IS, WE HAVE LOOKED 
AT PATTERNS OF HOW APPS HAVE 
USED OUR APIs AND  ACCESS 
INFORMATION, AS WELL AS LOOKING 
INTO APPS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
REPORTED THAT MIGHT BE DOING 
SKETCHY THINGS. 
GOING FORWARD, WE ARE GOING TO 
TAKE A PROACTIVE POSITION ON 
THIS AND DO MUCH MORE REGULAR 
SPOT CHECKS ON APPS, AS WELL AS 
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF AUDITS 
THAT WE DO. 
AND AGAIN, I CAN MAKE SURE THAT 
OUR TEAM FOLLOWS UP WITH YOU ON 
ANYTHING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC 
PAST STATS THAT MIGHT BE 
INTERESTING. 
>> I WAS GOING TO ASSUME THAT 
SITTING HERE TODAY, YOU HAVE NO 
IDEA. 
AND IF I'M WRONG ON THAT, YOU 
ARE ABLE -- YOU ARE TELLING ME, 
I THINK, THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO 
SUPPLY THOSE FIGURES TO US. 
AT LEAST AT THIS POINT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WILL HAVE MY 
TEAM FOLLOW-UP WITH YOU ON WHAT 
INFORMATION WE HAVE. 
>> OKAY, BUT RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE 
NO CERTAINTY ON WHETHER OR NOT, 
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS GOING ON, 
RIGHT? 
OKAY. 
FACEBOOK COLLECTS MASSIVE 
AMOUNTS OF DATA FROM CONSUMERS, 
INCLUDING CONTENT, NETWORKS, 
CONTACT LISTS, DEVICE 
INFORMATION, LOCATION, AND 
INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTIES, 
YET, YOUR DATA POLICY IS ONLY A 
FEW PAGES LONG AND PROVIDES 
CONSUMERS WITH ONLY A FEW 
EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS COLLECTED 
AND HOW IT MIGHT BE USED. 
THE EXAMPLES GIVEN EMPHASIZE 
BENIGN USES, SUCH AS CONNECTING 
WITH FRIENDS. 
BUT, YOUR POLICY DOES NOT GIVE 
ANY INDICATION FOR MORE 
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES OF SUCH 
DATA. 
MY QUESTION. 
WHY DOESN'T FACEBOOK DISCLOSE 
TO ITS USERS ALL THE WAY -- 
WAYS THE DATA MIGHT BE USED BY 
FACEBOOK, AND OTHER THIRD 
PARTIES? 
AND, WHAT IS FACEBOOK'S 
RESPONSIILITY TO INFORM USERS 
ABOUT THAT INFORMATION? 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I BELIEVE IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO TELL PEOPLE 
EXACTLY HOW THE INFORMATION 
THAT THEY SHARE ON FACEBOOK IS 
GOING TO BE USED. 
THAT'S WHY EVERY SINGLE TIME 
YOU GO TO SHARE SOMETHING ON 
FACEBOOK, WHETHER IT'S A PHOTO, 
OR A MESSAGE, A MESSAGE IN 
WHATSAPP, EVERY SIMPLE TIME, 
THERE IS A CONTROL ABOUT WHO 
YOU WILL BE SHARING IT WITH, 
WHETHER IT'S YOUR FRIENDS, 
PUBLIC, OR SPECIFIC GROUP.  
YOU CAN CHANGE ALL THAT AND 
CONTROL THAT IN LINE. 
TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE BROADER 
POLICY, THIS GETS INTO AN ISSUE 
THAT I THINK WE AND OTHERS IN 
THE TECH INDUSTRY HAVE FOUND 
CHALLENGING. 
WHICH IS THAT LONG PRIVACY 
POLICIES ARE VERY CONFUSING. 
AND IF YOU MAKE IT LONG AND 
SPELL OUT ALL THE DETAIL, YOU 
ARE PROBABLY GOING TO REDUCE 
THE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO READ 
 
THEM. 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE 
STRUGGLED WITH OVER TIME IS TO 
MAKE SOMETHING THAT IS AS 
SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE SO PEOPLE 
CAN UNDERSTAND IT, AS WELL AS 
GIVING THEM CONTROLS IN LINE, 
IN THE PRODUCTS, IN THE CONTEXT 
THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND IT. 
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE 
UNDERSTAND MOST PEOPLE DON'T 
WANT TO GO THROUGH AND READ A 
FULL LEGAL DOCUMENT. 
>> SENATOR NELSON. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
YESTERDAY WHEN WE TALKED,  I 
GAVE THE RELATIVELY HARMLESS 
EXAMPLE THAT I'M COMMUNICATING 
WITH MY FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK, 
AND INDICATE THAT I LOVE A 
CERTAIN KIND OF CHOCOLATE. 
AND, ALL OF THE SUDDEN, I START 
RECEIVING ADVERTISEMENTS FOR 
CHOCOLATE. 
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE 
THOSE COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENTS?
SO, YOUR CHIEF OPERATING 
OFFICER, MS. SANDBERG, 
SUGGESTED ON THE NBC TODAY 
SHOW, THAT FACEBOOK USERS WHO 
DO NOT WANT THEIR PERSONAL 
INFORMATION  USED FOR 
ADVERTISING,  MIGHT HAVE TO PAY 
FOR THAT PROTECTION. 
PAY FOR IT. 
ARE YOU ACTUALLY CONSIDERING 
HAVING FACEBOOK USERS PAY FOR 
YOU NOT TO USE THAT INFORMATION?
>> SENATOR, PEOPLE HAVE CONTROL 
OVER HOW THEIR INFORMATION IS 
USED IN ADS IN THE PRODUCT 
TODAY.  
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN 
EXPERIENCE, WHERE YOUR ADS 
AREN'T TARGETED USING ALL THE 
INFORMATION  WE HAVE AVAILABLE, 
YOU CAN TURN OFF THIRD-PARTY 
INFORMATION. 
WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT, EVEN 
THOUGH SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE 
ADS,  PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE 
ADS THAT AREN'T RELEVANT.  
WHILE THERE IS SOME DISCOMFORT 
FOR SURE WITH USING INFORMATION 
IN MAKING ADS,  MORE RELEVANT, 
THE OVERWHELMING FEEDBACK THAT 
WE GET FROM OUR COMMUNITY IS 
THAT PEOPLE WOULD RATHER HAVE 
US SHOW RELEVANT CONTENT THERE, 
THEN NOT. 
SO, WE OFFER THIS CONTROL THAT 
YOU ARE REFERENCING. 
SOME PEOPLE USE IT. 
IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE 
ON FACEBOOK. 
AND, I THINK THAT IS A GOOD 
EVEL OF CONTROL TO OFFER. 
I THINK WHAT SHERYL WAS SAYING 
IS THAT IN ORDER TO NOT RUN  
ADS AT ALL, WE WOULD STILL NEED 
SOME SORT OF BUSINESS MODEL.  
>> AND THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS 
MODEL. 
SO I TAKE IT THAT -- AND I USE 
THE HARMLESS EXAMPLE OF 
CHOCOLATE. 
BUT IF IT GOT INTO MORE 
PERSONAL THINGS, COMMUNICATING 
WITH FRIENDS, AND I WANT TO CUT 
IT OFF, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO 
PAY YOU IN ORDER NOT TO SEND 
ME, USING MY PERSONAL 
INFORMATION, SOMETHING THAT I 
DON'T WANT. 
THAT, IN ESSENCE, IS WHAT I 
UNDERSTAND MS. SANDBERG TO SAY. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
ALTHOUGH, TO BE CLEAR, WE DON'T 
OFFER AN OPTION TODAY FOR 
PEOPLE TO PAY  FOR NOT SHOWING 
ADS. 
WE THINK AN AD SUPPORTED 
SERVICE IS THE BEST CONNECTION 
TO THE WORLD. 
BECAUSE WE WANT TO OFFER  A 
FREE SERVICE THAT EVERYONE CAN 
AFFORD. 
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN 
REACH BILLIONS OF PEOPLE. 
>> THEREFORE, YOU CONSIDER MY 
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA, 
THE COMPANY'S DATA, NOT MY 
DATA. 
IS THAT IT? 
>> NO, SENATOR. 
ACTUALLY, THE FIRST LINE OF OUR 
TERMS OF SERVICE SAY THAT YOU 
CONTROL AND ON THE INFORMATION 
AND CONTENT THAT YOU PUT ON 
FACEBOOK. 
>> WELL, THE RECENT SCANDAL IS 
OBVIOUSLY FRUSTRATING, NOT ONLY 
BECAUSE IT AFFECTED 87 MILLION, 
BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE PART 
OF A PATTERN OF LAX DATA 
PRACTICES BY THE COMPANY GOING 
BACK YEARS. 
SO, BACK IN 2011, THERE WAS A 
SETTLEMENT WITH THE FTC, AND 
NOW WE DISCOVER YET ANOTHER 
INCIDENCE, WHERE THE  DATA WAS 
FAILED TO BE PROTECTED. 
WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THE 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA THAT HAD 
FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED ALL OF 
THIS INFORMATION, WHY DIDN'T 
YOU INFORM THOSE 87 MILLION? 
>> WHEN WE LEARNED IN 2015 THAT 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA HAD BOUGHT 
DATA FROM AN APPLE DEVELOPER ON 
FACEBOOK THAT PEOPLE HAD SHARED 
IT WITH, WE DID TAKE ACTION. 
WE TOOK DOWN THE APP, AND WE 
DEMANDED THAT BOTH THE APP 
DEVELOPER AND CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA DELETE AND STOP USING 
ANY DATA THAT THEY HAD. 
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY DID 
THIS. 
IN RETROSPECT, IT WAS CLEARLY A 
MISTAKE TO BELIEVE THEM AND WE 
SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED UP AND 
DONE A FULL AUDIT THEN. 
AND THAT IS NOT A MISTAKE THAT 
WE WILL MAKE. 
>> YES, YOU DID THAT, AND YOU 
APOLOGIZED FOR IT. 
BUT, YOU DIDN'T NOTIFY THEM. 
AND, DO YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE 
AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY 
87 MILLION FACEBOOK USERS? 
>> SENATOR, WHEN WE HEARD BACK 
FROM CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, THAT 
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY WEREN'T 
USING THE DATA AND THEY DELETED 
IT, WE CONSIDERED THAT A CLOSED 
CASE. 
IN RETROSPECT, THAT WAS CLEARLY 
 MISTAKE. 
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THEIR 
WORD FOR IT AND WE HAVE UPDATED 
POLICIES TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T 
MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN. 
>> DID ANYBODY NOTIFY THE FTC? 
>> NO, SENATOR. 
FOR THE SAME REASON, WE 
CONSIDERED IT A CLOSED CASE. 
>> SENATOR THUNE. 
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, WOULD YOU DO 
THAT  DIFFERENTLY TODAY? 
úIN RE 
QUESTION, HAVING TO DO IT OVER? 
>> YES. 
>> THIS MAY BE YOUR FIRST TIME 
TO APPEAR BEFORE CONGRESS BUT 
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME 
FACEBOOK HAS FACED TOUGH 
QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS PRIVACY 
POLICIES. 
"WIRED MAGAZINE" NOTED THAT YOU 
HAVE A HISTORY OF REGARDING ILL-
ADVISED POLICIES, REGARDING 
USER PRIVACY, NOT UNLIKE THE 
ONE YOU MADE JUST NOW IN YOUR 
OPENING STATEMENT. 
AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF 
PROMISES TO DO BETTER, HOW IS 
TODAY'S APOLOGY DIFFERENT? 
AND, WHY SHOULD WE TRUST 
FACEBOOK TO MAKE THE NECESSARY 
CHANGES TO ENSURE USER PRIVACY, 
AND GIVE PEOPLE A CLEARER 
PICTURE OF YOUR PRIVACY 
POLICIES? 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
SO, WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF 
MISTAKES IN RUNNING THE 
COMPANY. 
I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH 
IMPOSSIBLE I BELIEVE, TO START 
A COMPANY IN YOUR DORM ROOM AND 
GROW IT TO BE THE SCALE WE ARE 
AT NOW WITHOUT MAKING SOME 
MISTAKES. 
BECAUSE OUR SERVICE IS ABOUT 
HELPING PEOPLE CONNECT AND 
INFORMATION, THOSE MISTAKES 
HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT, AND WE TRY 
NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE 
MULTIPLE TIMES. 
BUT IN GENERAL, A LOT OF THE 
MISTAKES ARE AROUND HOW PEOPLE 
CONNECT TO EACH OTHER, JUST 
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE 
SERVICE. 
OVERALL, I WOULD SAY WE ARE 
GOING THROUGH A BROADER 
PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT IN HOW WE 
APPROACH OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS 
A COMPANY. 
FOR THE FIRST 10 OR 12 YEARS AS 
A COMPANY, I REVIEWED OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY AS PRIMARILY 
BUILDING TOOLS. 
THAT IF WE COULD PUT THOSE 
TOOLS IN PEOPLE'S HANDS, THAT 
WOULD EMPOWER PEOPLE TO DO GOOD 
THINGS. 
WHAT I THINK WE LEARNED NOW 
ACROSS A NUMBER OF ISSUES, NOT 
JUST DATA PRIVACY BUT ALSO FAKE 
NEWS AND FOREIGN -ELECTIONS, WE 
NEED TO TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE 
ROLE IN OUR BROADER 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO BUILD 
TOOLS. 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT  THEY 
ARE USED FOR GOOD. 
WE NEED TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE 
VIEW IN POLICING THE ECOSYSTEM, 
AND, IN WATCHING AND KIND OF 
LOOKING OUT AND MAKING SURE 
THAT ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR 
COMMUNITY IS USING THESE TOOLS 
IN A WAY THAT'S GOING TO BE 
GOOD AND HEALTHY. 
SO, AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS 
IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WHERE 
PEOPLE WILL MEASURE US BY OUR 
RESULTS ON THIS. 
IT'S NOT THAT I EXPECT ANYTHING 
I SAY HERE TODAY TO NECESSARILY 
CHANGE PEOPLE'S VIEWS. 
BUT I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING 
THIS RIGHT AND I BELIEVE OVER 
THE COMING YEARS, ONCE WE FULLY 
WORK ALL OF THESE SOLUTIONS 
THROUGH, PEOPLE WILL SEE REAL 
DIFFERENCES. 
>> AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU ALL 
HAVE GOTTEN THAT MESSAGE. 
AS WE DISCUSSED IN MY OFFICE 
YESTERDAY, THE LINE BETWEEN 
LEGITIMATE POLITICAL DISCOURSE 
AND HATE SPEECH CAN SOMETIMES 
BE HARD TO IDENTIFY. 
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN RELYING ON 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND 
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE 
INITIAL DISCOVERY. 
CAN YOU DISCUSS WHAT STEPS THAT 
FACEBOOK CURRENTLY TAKES WHEN 
MAKING THESE EVALUATIONS? 
THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE, 
AND ANY EXAMPLES OF WHERE YOU 
MAY DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT 
IS AND WHAT IS NOT HATE SPEECH? 
>> YES, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I'LL SPEAK TO HATE SPEECH, AND 
THEN I WILL TALK ABOUT 
ENFORCING OUR CONTENT POLICIES 
MORE BROADLY. 
ACTUALLY, IF YOU ARE OKAY WITH 
IT, I WILL GO IN THE OTHER 
ORDER. 
SO, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 
COMPANY, IN 2004, I STARTED IN 
MY DORM ROOM, IT WAS ME AND MY 
ROOMMATE. 
WE DID NOT HAVE AI TECHNOLOGY 
THAT COULD LOOK AT THE CONTENT 
THAT PEOPLE WERE SHARING.  
SO, WE BASICALLY HAD TO ENFORCE 
OUR CONTENT POLICIES 
REACTIVELY. 
PEOPLE COULD SHARE WHAT THEY 
WANTED, AND THEN IF SOMEBODY IN 
THE COMMUNITY FOUND IT TO BE 
OFFENSIVE OR AGAINST OUR 
POLICIES, THEY WOULD FLAG IT 
FOR US AND LOOK AT IT 
PROACTIVELY. 
NOW INCREASINGLY, WE ARE 
DEVELOPING AI TOOLS THAT CAN 
IDENTIFY CERTAIN CLASSES OF BAD 
ACTIVITY  AND FLAG IT ON 
FACEBOOK. 
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR, WE ARE 
GOING TO HAVE 20,000 PEOPLE 
WORKING ON SECURITY AND CONTENT 
REVIEW WORKING ACROSS ALL THESE 
THINGS. 
SO WHEN CONTENT GETS FLAGGED TO 
US, WE HAVE THESE PEOPLE LOOK 
AT IT. 
AND IF IT VIOLATES OUR 
POLICIES, WE CAN TAKE IT DOWN. 
SOME PROBLEMS LEND THEMSELVES 
MORE EASILY TO AI SOLUTIONS 
THAN OTHERS.  
SO, HATE SPEECH IS ONE OF THE 
HARDEST. 
BECAUSE DETERMINING IF 
SOMETHING IS HATE SPEECH IS 
VERY LINGUISTICALLY NUANCED. 
RIGHT? 
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND, WHAT IS 
A SLUR, AND WHETHER SOMETHING 
IS HATEFUL, NOT JUST IN 
ENGLISH, BUT THE MAJORITY OF 
PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK USE IT IN 
LANGUAGES THAT ARE DIFFERENT 
ACROSS THE WORLD. 
YOU CAN CONTRAST THAT, FOR 
EXAMPLE, IN AN AREA LIKE 
FINDING TERRORIST PROPAGANDA, 
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN VERY 
SUCCESSFUL AT DEPLOYING AI 
TOOLS ON ALREADY. 
TODAY AS WE SAID HERE,  95% OF 
THE ISIS AND AL QAEDA CONTENT 
THAT WE TAKE DOWN ON FACEBOOK, 
OUR AI SYSTEMS FLAG IT  BEFORE 
ANY HUMAN SEES IT. 
THAT IS A SUCCESS IN ROLLING 
OUT AI TOOLS THAT CAN 
PROACTIVELY POLICE AND ENFORCE  
SAFETY ACROSS THE COMMUNITY. 
HATE SPEECH, I'M OPTIMISTIC, 
THAT OVER A 5 TO 10 YEAR 
PERIOD, WE WILL HAVE AI TOOLS  
THAT CAN GET INTO SOME OF THE 
LINGUISTIC NUANCES OF DIFFERENT 
TYPES OF CONTENT, TO BE MORE 
ACCURATE IN FLAGGING THINGS FOR 
OUR SYSTEMS. 
BUT TODAY, WE ARE JUST NOT 
THERE ON THAT. 
A LOT OF THIS IS STILL REACTIVE.
PEOPLE WILL FLAG AT US. 
WE HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT IT. 
WE HAVE POLICIES TO TRY TO MAKE 
IT NOT AS OBJECTIVE AS 
POSSIBLE. 
UNTIL WE GET IT MODERATED, 
THERE IS A HIGHER ERROR RATE 
úT 
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
>> THANKS, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG,  WHAT IS 
FACEBOOK DOING TO PREVENT 
FOREIGN ACTORS FROM INTERFERING 
IN U.S. ELECTIONS? 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 
THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP 
PRIORITIES IN 2018, TO GET THIS 
RIGHT. 
ONE OF MY GREATEST REGRETS IN 
RUNNING THE COMPANY IS THAT WE 
WERE SLOW IN IDENTIFYING THE 
RUSSIAN INFORMATION OPERATIONS 
IN 2016. 
WE EXPECTED THEM TO DO A NUMBER 
OF MORE TRADITIONAL CYBER 
ATTACKS, WHICH WE DID IDENTIFY 
AND NOTIFY THE CAMPAIGNS THAT 
THEY WERE TRYING TO HACK INTO 
THEM. 
BUT, THEY WERE SLOW IN 
IDENTIFYING THE TYPE OF NEW 
INFORMATION OPERATIONS. 
>> WHEN DID YOU IDENTIFY NEW 
OPERATIONS? 
>> IT WAS RIGHT AROUND THE TIME 
OF THE 2016 ELECTION ITSELF. 
SO, SINCE THEN, 2018 IS AN 
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YEAR FOR 
ELECTIONS. 
NOT JUST WITH THE U.S. 
MIDTERMS, BUT AROUND THE WORLD. 
THERE ARE IMPORTANT ELECTIONS 
IN INDIA, BRAZIL, PAKISTAN, AND 
HUNGARY. 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO 
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT 
THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE 
ELECTIONS. 
I HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE THAT WE 
WILL GET THIS RIGHT, BECAUSE 
SINCE THE 2016 ELECTION, THERE 
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL IMPORTANT 
ELECTIONS AROUND THE WORLD 
úWHE 
RECORD. 
THERE WAS THE FRENCH ELECTION, 
GERMAN ELECTION, SPECIAL ALABAMA
ELECTION LAST YEAR. 
>> EXPLAIN WHAT IS BETTER ABOUT 
THE RECORD. 
>> SO, WE'VE DEPLOYED NEW AI 
TOOLS THAT DO A BETTER JOB OF 
IDENTIFYING  FAKE ACCOUNTS THAT 
MAY BE TRYING TO INTERFERE IN 
ELECTIONS OR SPREAD 
MISINFORMATION. 
AND BETWEEN THOSE THREE 
ELECTIONS, WE WERE ABLE TO 
PROACTIVELY REMOVE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS, THAT 
BEFORE THEY COULD CONTRIBUTE 
SIGNIFICANT HARM, AND THE 
NATURE OF THESE ATTACKS, THOUGH,
IS THAT, THERE ARE PEOPLE IN 
RUSSIA WHOSE JOB IT IS TO TRY 
TO EXPLOIT OUR SYSTEMS AND 
OTHER INTERNET SYSTEMS AND 
OTHER SYSTEMS AS WELL. 
SO, THIS IS AN ARMS RACE. 
THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP GETTING 
BETTER AT THIS AND WE NEED TO 
KEEP IN BEST ON GETTING BETTER 
AT THIS, TOO. 
WHICH IS WHY I MENTIONED 
BEFORE, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 
MORE THAN 20,000 PEOPLE WORKING 
ON SECURITY AND CONTENT REVIEW 
ACROSS THE COMPANY. 
>> SPEAK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT 
AUTOMATED BOTS THAT SPREAD 
DISINFORMATION.  
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PUNISH 
THOSE THAT EXPLOIT YOUR 
PLATFORM IN THAT REGARD? 
>> WELL, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO 
HAVE A FAKE ACCOUNT ON 
FACEBOOK. 
YOUR CONTENT HAS TO BE 
AUTHENTIC. 
SO, WE BUILD TECHNICAL TOOLS TO 
TRY TO IDENTIFY WHEN PEOPLE ARE 
CREATING FAKE ACCOUNTS. 
ESPECIALLY LARGE NETWORKS LIKE 
THE RUSSIANS HAVE, IN ORDER TO 
REMOVE ALL OF THAT CONTENT. 
AFTER THE 2016 ELECTION, OUR 
TOP PRIORITY WAS PROTECTING THE 
INTEGRITY OF OTHER ELECTIONS 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAD A 
PARALLEL EFFORT TO TRACE BACK 
TO RUSSIA THE IRA ACTIVITY AS 
PART OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT 
THAT DID THIS ACTIVITY IN 2016. 
AND, JUST LAST WEEK, WE WERE 
ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT A NUMBER 
OF RUSSIAN MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS 
THAT WERE SANCTIONED BY THE 
RUSSIAN REGULATOR WERE OPERATED 
AND CONTROLLED BY THIS INTERNET 
RESEARCH AGENCY. 
SO, WE TOOK A STEP LAST WEEK, 
THERE WAS A PRETTY BIG STEP OF 
TAKING DOWN THE SANCTIONED NEWS 
ORGANIZATIONS IN RUSSIA, AS 
PART OF AN OPERATION TO REMOVE 
270 FAKE ACCOUNTS AND PAGES, 
PART OF A BROADER NETWORK IN 
RUSSIA, THAT WAS ACTUALLY NOT 
TARGETING INTERNATIONAL 
INTERFERENCE AS MUCH AS -- I'M 
SORRY, LET ME CORRECT THAT. 
THAT WAS PRIMARILY SPREADING 
MISINFORMATION IN RUSSIA 
ITSELF, AS WELL AS CERTAIN 
RUSSIAN-SPEAKING NEIGHBORING 
COUNTRIES. 
>> HOW MANY ACCOUNTS OF THIS 
TYPE HAVE YOU TAKEN DOWN? 
>> IN THE IRA SPECIFICALLY, THE 
ONES THAT WE HAVE PEGGED BACK 
TO THE IRA, WE CAN IDENTIFY 470 
IN THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS, AND 
270S THAT WE SPECIFICALLY WENT 
AFTER IN RUSSIA LAST WEEK. 
THERE ARE MANY OTHERS THAT OUR 
SYSTEMS CATCH, WHICH ARE MORE 
DIFFICULT TO ATTRIBUTE 
SPECIFICALLY TO RUSSIAN 
INTELLIGENCE. 
THAT THE NUMBER WOULD BE IN THE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAKE 
ACCOUNTS THAT WE MAY REMOVE. 
AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE MY TEAM 
FOLLOW-UP WITH YOU ON MORE 
INFORMATION IF THAT WOULD BE 
HELPFUL. 
>> WOULD YOU, PLEASE? 
I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
IF YOU KNEW IN 2015 THAT 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WAS USING 
THE INFORMATION OF PROFESSOR 
COGAN, WHY DID YOU WAIT? 
>> SENATOR, THAT'S A GREAT 
QUESTION.  
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WASN'T 
USING OUR SERVICES IN 2018 AS 
FAR AS WE CAN TELL. 
SO THIS IS CLEARLY ONE OF THE 
QUESTIONS THAT WE ASKED OUR 
TEEN. 
WHY DID WE WAIT UNTIL WE FOUND 
OUT ABOUT THE REPORTS LAST 
MONTH, TO BAN THEM? 
IT'S BECAUSE, AS OF THE TIME WE 
LEARNED ABOUT THEIR ACTIVITY IN 
2015, THEY WEREN'T AN 
ADVERTISER OR RUNNING PAGES. 
SO WE HAD NOTHING TO BAN. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR FEINSTEIN.
NOW SENATOR HATCH. 
>> WELL, THIS IS THE MOST 
INTENSE PUBLIC SCRUTINY I'VE 
EVER SEEN FOR A TECH RELATED 
HEARING SINCE THE MICROSOFT 
HEARING THAT I CHAIRED BACK IN 
THE LATE 1990s. 
THE RECENT STORIES ABOUT 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AND DATA 
MINING ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE 
RAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT 
CONSUMER PRIVACY, AND 
NATURALLY, I KNOW YOU 
UNDERSTAND THAT. 
AT THE SAME TIME, THESE STORIES 
TOUCH ON THE VERY FOUNDATION OF 
THE INTERNET ECONOMY, AND THE 
WAY THE WEBSITES, THAT DRIVE 
OUR INTERNET ECONOMY, MAKE 
MONEY. 
SOME HAVE PROFESSED THEMSELVES 
SHOCKED -- SHOCKED THAT 
COMPANIES LIKE FACEBOOK AND 
GOOGLE SHARE USER DATA WITH 
ADVERTISERS. 
DID ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS 
EVER STOP TO ASK THEMSELVES WHY 
FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE DON'T CHARGE 
FOR ACCESS? 
NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE. 
EVERYTHING INVOLVES TRADE-OFFS. 
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING WITHOUT 
HAVING TO PAY MONEY FOR IT, YOU 
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT 
IN SOME OTHER WAY, IT SEEMS TO 
ME. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING 
HERE. 
THESE GREAT WEBSITES THAT DON'T 
CHARGE FOR ACCESS, THEY EXTRACT 
VALUE IN SOME OTHER WAY. 
AND, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH 
THAT, AS LONG AS THEY ARE 
UPFRONT WITH WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING. 
IN MY MIND, THE ISSUE HERE IS 
TRANSPARENCY. 
ITS CONSUMER CHOICE. 
DO USERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY 
ARE AGREEING TO WHEN THEY 
ACCESS A WEBSITE OR AGREE TO 
TERMS OF SERVICE? 
OUR WEBSITES UPFRONT ABOUT HOW 
THEY EXTRACT VALUE FROM USERS? 
OR DO THEY HIDE THE BALL? 
DO CONSUMERS HAVE THE 
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE 
AN INFORMED CHOICE REGARDING 
WHETHER OR NOT TO VISIT A 
PARTICULAR WEBSITE? 
IN MY MIND, THESE ARE QUESTIONS 
THAT WE SHOULD ASK OR BE 
FOCUSING ON. 
NOW, MR. ZUCKERBERG, I REMEMBER 
WELL YOUR FIRST VISIT TO 
CAPITOL HILL BACK IN 2010.  
YOU SPOKE TO THE SENATE 
REPUBLICAN HIGH TASK FORCE, úWH 
YOU SAID BACK THEN THAT 
FACEBOOK WOULD ALWAYS BE FREE. 
IS THAT STILL YOUR OBJECTIVE? 
>> SENATOR, YES. 
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A VERSION 
OF FACEBOOK THAT IS FREE. 
IT IS OUR MISSION TO TRY TO 
HELP CONNECT EVERYONE AROUND 
THE WORLD AND BRING THE WORLD 
CLOSER TOGETHER. 
IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO 
OFFER A SERVICE THAT EVERYONE 
CAN AFFORD AND WE ARE COMMITTED 
TO DOING THAT. 
>> IF SO, HOW DO YOU SUSTAIN A 
BUSINESS MODEL IN WHICH USERS 
DON'T PAY FOR YOUR SERVICE? 
>> SENATOR, WE RUN ADS.  
>> WHEN EVER A CONTROVERSY LIKE 
THIS ARISES, THERE'S ALWAYS A 
DANGER THAT CONGRESS' RESPONSE 
WILL BE TO STEP IN AND 
OVERREGULATED. 
THAT HAS BEEN THE EXPERIENCE 
THAT I'VE HAD IN MY 42 YEARS 
HERE. 
IN YOUR VIEW, WHAT SORTS OF 
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES WOULD HELP 
SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THE 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA STORY HAS 
REVEALED? 
AND, WHAT SORTS OF LEGISLATIVE 
CHANGES WOULD NOT HELP TO SOLVE 
THIS ISSUE? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THERE 
ARE A FEW CATEGORIES OF 
LEGISLATION THAT MAKES SENSE TO 
CONSIDER. 
AROUND PRIVACY SPECIFICALLY, 
THERE ARE A FEW PRINCIPLES THAT 
I THINK WOULD BE USEFUL TO 
DISCUSS. 
AND POTENTIALLY CODIFY INTO LAW.
ONE IS AROUND HAVING A SIMPLE 
AND PRACTICAL SET OF WAYS THAT 
YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
WITH DATA. 
AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT 
EARLIER AROUND THE COMPLEXITY 
OF LAYING OUT THESE LONG 
PRIVACY POLICIES. 
IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT PEOPLE 
FULLY UNDERSTAND SOMETHING WHEN 
IT'S ONLY WRITTEN OUT IN THE 
LONG LEGAL DOCUMENT. 
THIS STUFF NEEDS TO BE 
IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY WHERE 
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND 
IT. 
CONSUMERS CAN UNDERSTAND IT. 
BUT THAT CAN ALSO CAPTURE THE 
NUANCES OF HOW THESE SERVICES 
WORK IN A WAY THAT IS NOT 
OVERLY RESTRICTIVE ON PROVIDING 
THE SERVICES. 
THAT'S ONE. 
THE SECOND IS AROUND GIVING 
PEOPLE COMPLETE CONTROL. 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
PRINCIPLE FOR FACEBOOK. 
EVERY PIECE OF CONTENT THAT YOU 
SHARE ON FACEBOOK YOU OWN, AND 
YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER 
WHO SEES IT, AND HOW YOU SHARE 
IT. 
AND YOU CAN REMOVE IT AT ANY 
TIME. 
THAT'S WHY EVERY DAY, ABOUT 100 
BILLION TIMES A DAY, PEOPLE 
COME TO ONE OF OUR SERVICES AND 
EITHER POST A PHOTO OR SEND A 
MESSAGE TO SOMEONE, BECAUSE 
THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THAT 
CONTROL, AND WHO THEY SAY IT'S 
GOING TO GO TO IS GOING TO BE 
WHO SEES THE CONTENT. 
I THINK THAT CONTROL IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT AND 
SHOULD APPLY TO EVERY SERVICE. 
AND THE THIRD POINT IS JUST 
AROUND ENABLING INNOVATION. 
BECAUSE, SOME OF THESE USE 
CASES THAT ARE VERY SENSITIVE, 
LIKE FACE RECOGNITION, FOR 
EXAMPLE, I THINK THERE IS A 
BALANCE THAT IS EXTREMELY 
IMPORTANT TO STRIKE HERE, WHERE 
YOU OBTAIN SPECIAL CONSENT FOR 
SENSITIVE FEATURES LIKE FACE 
RECOGNITION, BUT, WE STILL NEED 
TO MAKE IT SO THAT AMERICAN 
COMPANIES CAN INNOVATE IN THOSE 
AREAS, OR ELSE WE ARE GOING TO 
FALL BEHIND CHINESE COMPETITORS 
AND OTHERS AROUND THE WORLD WHO 
HAVE DIFFERENT REGIMES FOR 
DIFFERENT NEW FEATURES LIKE 
THAT. 
>> SENATOR CANTWELL? 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
WELCOME, MR. ZUCKERBERG.  
DO YOU KNOW WHO PALANTIR IS? 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO 
THEM AS A STANFORD  ANALYTICA. 
DO YOU AGREE?  
>> I AGREE. 
>> TO AGREE WITH HOW CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA TACTICS ARE SAYING 
HOW TO DO THESE CHARGES? 
>> SENATOR, I DON'T KNOW. 
DO YOU THINK THAT PALANTIR HAS 
EVER SCRAPED  DATA FROM 
FACEBOOK? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT AWARE OF 
THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
DO YOU THINK THAT DURING THE 
2016 CAMPAIGN, AS CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA WAS PROVIDING SUPPORT 
TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN UNDER 
PROJECT ALAMO, WERE THERE ANY 
FACEBOOK PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT
SHARING OF TECHNIQUE AND 
INFORMATION? 
>> SENATOR, WE PROVIDED SUPPORT 
TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, SIMILAR 
TO WHAT WE PROVIDE TO ANY 
ADVERTISER OR CAMPAIGN, WHO 
ASKS FOR IT. 
>> SO, THAT WAS A YES. 
IS THAT A YES? 
>> CAN YOU REPEAT THE SPECIFIC 
QUESTION? 
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I 
SPECIFICALLY GET WHAT YOU ARE 
ASKING. 
>> DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WORKED WITH 
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO REFINE 
TACTICS, AND WERE FACEBOOK 
EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THAT? 
>> SENATOR, I DON'T KNOW THAT 
OUR EMPLOYEES WERE INVOLVED 
WITH CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. 
ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT WE DID 
HELP OUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 
OVERALL IN SALES SUPPORT IN THE 
SAME WAY THAT WE DO WITH OTHER 
CAMPAIGNS. ú>> SO THEY MAY HAVE 
INVOLVED IN WORKING TOGETHER 
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD? 
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING YOUR 
INVESTIGATION WILL FIND OUT. 
>> SENATOR, I CAN CERTAINLY 
HAVE MY TEAM GET BACK TO YOU ON 
ANY SPECIFIC THAT I DON'T HAVE 
HERE SITTING TODAY. 
>> HAVE YOU HEARD OF TOTAL 
INFORMATION AWARENESS? 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT? 
>> NO, I DO NOT. 
>> OKAY. 
TOTAL INFORMATION AWARENESS WAS 
2003, JOHN ASHCROFT AND OTHERS 
TRYING TO DO SIMILAR THINGS TO 
WHAT I THINK IS BEHIND ALL OF 
THIS. 
GEOPOLITICAL FORCES TRYING TO 
GET DATA AND INFORMATION TO 
INFLUENCE A PROCESS. 
SO WHEN I LOOK AT PALANTIR AND 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING, AND I LOOK 
AT  WHATSAPP, WHICH IS ANOTHER 
ACQUISITION, AND I LOOK AT 
WHERE  YOU ARE FROM THE 2011 
CONSENT DECREE, AND WHERE YOU 
ARE TODAY, I'M THINKING, IS 
THIS GUY OUTFOXING THE FOXES? 
OR, IS HE GOING ALONG WITH WHAT 
IS A MAJOR TREND IN AN 
INFORMATION AGE, TO TRY TO 
HARVEST INFORMATION FOR 
POLITICAL FORCES? 
AND SO, MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, 
DO YOU SEE THAT THOSE 
APPLICATIONS, THAT THOSE 
COMPANIES, PALANTIR, AND EVEN  
WHATSAPP, ARE GOING TO FALL 
INTO THE SAME SITUATION THAT 
YOU HAVE JUST FALLEN TO OVER 
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS? 
>> SENATOR,  I'M NOT SURE 
SPECIFICALLY. 
OVERALL, I DO THINK THAT THESE 
ISSUES AROUND INFORMATION 
ACCESS ARE CHALLENGING. 
TO THE SPECIFICS ABOUT THOSE 
APPS, I'M NOT REALLY THAT 
FAMILIARWITH WHAT PALANTIR 
DOES.  
WHATSAPP COLLECTS VERY LITTLE 
INFORMATION. 
AND I THINK IS LESS LIKELY TO 
HAVE THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SERVICE 
IS ARCHITECTED. 
BUT CERTAINLY,  I THINK THESE 
ARE BROAD ISSUES ACROSS THE 
TECH INDUSTRY. 
>> WELL I GUESS GIVEN THE TRACK 
ECORD OF WHERE FACEBOOK IS  
WHY YOU ARE HERE TODAY, I GUESS 
PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THEY DID 
NOT ACT BOLDLY ENOUGH. 
AND, THE FACT THAT PEOPLE LIKE 
JOHN BOLTON, BASICALLY WAS AN 
INVESTOR, AND THE NEW YORK 
TIMES ARTICLE EARLIER, I GUESS 
IT WAS ACTUALLY LAST MONTH, 
THAT THE BOLTON PACK WAS 
OBSESSED WITH HOW AMERICA WAS 
BECOMING LIMP WRISTED AND 
SPINELESS AND WANTED RESEARCH 
AND MESSAGING FOR NATIONAL 
SECURITY ISSUES. 
SO, THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 
ARE INTERESTED IN THIS LARGER 
EFFORT, AND WHAT I THINK MY 
CONSTITUENTS WANT TO KNOW IS, 
WAS THIS DISCUSSED AT YOUR 
BOARD MEETINGS? 
AND, WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS 
AND INTERESTS THAT ARE BEING 
DISCUSSED, WITHOUT PUTTING REAL 
TEETH INTO THIS? 
WE DON'T WANT TO COME BACK TO 
THE SITUATION AGAIN. 
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ALL THE 
TALENT. 
MY QUESTION IS, WHETHER YOU 
HAVE ALL OF THE WILL TO HELP US 
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
SO, DATA PRIVACY AND FOREIGN 
INTERFERENCE AND ELECTIONS ARE 
CERTAINLY TOPICS THAT WE'VE 
DISCUSSED AT THE BOARD MEETING. 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST 
ISSUES THAT THE COMPANY HAS 
FACED AND WE FEEL A HUGE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THESE 
RIGHT. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THE EUROPEAN 
REGULATIONS SHOULD BE APPLIED 
HERE IN THE U.S.? 
>> SENATOR, I BELIEVE EVERYONE  
PRIVACY CONTACTS. 
AND, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE 
IMPLEMENT THE EXACT SAME 
REGULATION, I WOULD GUESS THAT 
WOULD BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMEWHAT 
DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES IN THE 
U.S., AS DO OTHER COUNTRIES. 
WE ARE COMMITTED TO ROLLING OUT 
THE CONTROLS, AND THE 
AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. 
AND, THE SPECIAL CONTROLS 
AROUND SENSITIVE TYPES OF 
TECHNOLOGY, LIKE FACE 
RECOGNITION, THAT ARE REQUIRED 
IN GDPR, WE ARE DOING THAT 
AROUND THE WORLD.  
IT IS WORTH DISCUSSING WHETHER 
WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING 
SIMILAR IN THE U.S. BUT WHAT 
I'D LIKE TO SAY TODAY IS THAT 
WE ARE GOING TO GO FORWARD AND 
IMPLEMENT THAT, REGARDLESS OF 
WHAT THE REGULATORY OUTCOME IS. 
>> SENATOR THUNE WILL CHAIR 
NEXT.  
SENATOR WICKER? 
>> MY QUESTION IS GOING TO BE A 
FOLLOW-UP ON WHAT SENATOR HATCH 
WAS TALKINGABOUT.  
LET ME AGREE WITH BASICALLY HIS 
ADVICE, THAT WE DON'T WANT TO 
OVER REGULATE TO THE POINT 
WHERE WE ARE STIFLING 
INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT. 
I UNDERSTAND WITH REGARD TO 
SUGGESTED RULES, OR SUGGESTING 
LEGISLATION, THERE ARE AT LEAST 
TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT OUT 
THERE. 
ONE WOULD BE THE ISPs, THE  
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHO 
ARE ADVOCATING FOR PRIVACY 
PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS WHO 
APPLY TO ALL ONLINE ENTITIES, 
EQUALLY, ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
INTERNET ECOSYSTEM. 
NOW, FACEBOOK IS AN EDGE 
PROVIDER ON THE OTHER HAND. 
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MANY 
EDGE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS 
FACEBOOK, WILL NOT SUPPORT THAT 
EFFORT, BECAUSE EDGE PROVIDERS 
HAVE DIFFERENT RICHNESS MODELS 
THAN THE ISPS AND SHOULD NOT BE 
CONSIDERED LIKE SERVICES. 
SO, DO YOU THINK WE NEED 
CONSISTENT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS 
FROM CONSUMERS ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE INTERNE ECOSYSTEM THAT 
ARE BASED ON THE TYPE OF 
CONSUMER INFORMATION BEING 
COLLECTED, USED, OR SHARED? 
REGARDLESS OF THE ENTITY DOING 
THE COLLECTING OR USING OR 
SHARING? 
>> SENATOR, THIS IS AN 
IMPORTANT QUESTION. 
I WOULD DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN 
ISPs, WHICH I  CONSIDERED TO BE 
THE PIPES OF FACEBOOK, OR THE 
APPS LIKE GOOGLE, TWITTER, OR 
YOUTUBE, THAT ARE THE APPS OR 
PLATFORMS ON TOP OF THAT. 
I THINK IN GENERAL, THE 
EXPECTATIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
OF THE PIPES ARE SOMEWHAT 
DIFFERENT FROM THE PLATFORMS. 
SO THERE MIGHT BE AREAS WHERE 
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE 
REGULATION IN ONE AND LESS IN 
THE OTHER, BUT I THINK THERE 
WILL BE OTHER ISSUES WHERE 
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE 
REGULATION OF THE OTHER TYPE. 
SPECIFICALLY, THOUGH, ON THE 
PIPES, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT 
ISSUES THAT I THINK WE FACE, 
AND HAVE DEBATED IS -- 
>> WHEN YOU SAY PIPES, YOU MEAN 
-- 
>> ISPs. 
AND I KNOW THAT NET NEUTRALITY 
HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF DEBATE. 
ONE OF THE REASONS I SAY THAT 
SHOULD BE THE CASE IS I LOOK AT 
MY OWN STORY OF WHEN I WAS 
GETTING STARTED BUILDING 
FACEBOOK AT HARVARD. 
I ONLY HAD ONE OPTION FOR AN 
ISP TO USE AND IF I HAD TO PAY 
EXTRA IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SO 
THAT MY APP COULD POTENTIALLY 
ú 
PEOPLE, THEN WE PROBABLY WOULD 
NOT BE HERE TODAY. 
>> OKAY, BUT WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS. 
LET ME SAY, WE WILL HAVE TO 
FOLLOW UP ON THIS. 
I THINK YOU AND I AGREE, THIS 
IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR 
ITEMS OF DEBATE, IF WE HAVE TO 
GO FORWARD AND DO THIS FROM A 
GOVERNMENTAL STANDPOINT. 
LET ME JUST MOVE ON TO ANOTHER 
COUPLE OF ITEMS. 
IS IT TRUE, THAT AS WAS 
RECENTLY PUBLICIZED, THAT 
FACEBOOK COLLECTS THE CALL AND 
TEXT HISTORIES OF ITS USERS 
THAT USE ANDROID PHONES? 
>> SENATOR, WE HAVE AN APP 
CALLED MESSENGER, FOR SENDING 
MESSAGES TO YOUR FACEBOOK 
FRIENDS. 
AND THAT APP OFFERS PEOPLE AN 
OPTION TO SYNC THEIR TEXT 
MESSAGES INTO THE MESSAGING 
APP,  AND TO MAKE IT SO THAT 
BASICALLY YOU CAN HAVE ONE APP, 
WHERE IT HAS BOTH YOUR TEXTS, 
AND YOUR FACEBOOK MESSAGES IN 
ONE PLACE. 
WE ALSO ALLOW PEOPLE THE OPTION 
OF -- 
>> DO YOU OPT IN OR OUT OF 
THAT? 
>> IT IS OPT IN. 
YOU HAVE TO AFFIRMATIVELY SAY 
THAT YOU WANT TO SYNC THAT 
INFORMATION BEFORE WE GET 
ACCESS TO IT. 
>> UNLESS YOU OPT IN,  YOU 
DON'T COLLECT THAT CALL AND 
TEXT HISTORY. 
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 
>> AND IS THAT TRUE FOR -- IS 
THIS PRACTICE DONE AT ALL WITH 
MINORS? 
OR DO YOU MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR 
PERSONS AGE 13 TO 17. 
>> I DO NOT KNOW. 
I CAN FOLLOW UP ON THAT. 
>> LET'S DO THAT. 
ONE OTHER THING. 
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT 
FACEBOOK CAN TRACK USERS' 
INTERNET BROWSING HISTORY EVEN 
AFTER THAT USER HAS LOGGED OFF 
OF THE FACEBOOK PLATFORM. 
CAN YOU CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT 
THIS IS TRUE? 
>> SENATOR, I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
I GET THIS ACCURATE, SO IT 
WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER TO 
HAVE MY TEAM FOLLOW UP. 
>> YOU DON'T KNOW? 
>> I KNOW THAT PEOPLE USE 
COOKIES ON THE INTERNET, AND 
YOU CAN PROBABLY CORRELATE 
ACTIVITY BETWEEN SESSIONS. WE 
DO THAT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS,
INCLUDING SECURITY, AND 
INCLUDING AND MEASURING ADS, TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THE AD 
EXPERIENCES THE MOST EFFECTIVE, 
WHICH OF COURSE PEOPLE CAN OPT 
OUT OF. 
BUT I  WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M 
PRECISE IN THAT. 
>> WHEN YOU GET BACK TO ME, 
SIR, WOULD YOU ALSO LET US KNOW 
HOW FACEBOOK DISCLOSES TO ITS 
USERS THAT ENGAGING IN THIS 
TYPE OF TRACK GIVES US THAT 
RESULTS? 
>> YES. 
>> AND, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR WICKER.  
>> THANK YOU. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, I ASSUME THAT 
FACEBOOK HAS BEEN SERVED  THE 
SUBPOENAS FROM THE SPECIAL 
COUNCILWOMAN'S OFFICE. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> HAVE YOU OR ANYONE IN 
FACEBOOK BEEN CONTACTED BY THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE? 
HAVE YOU BEEN INTERVIEWED? 
>> I HAVE NOT. 
>> OTHERS HAVE? 
>> I BELIEVE SO. 
AND I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE, 
BECAUSE THAT OUR WORK WITH THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL IS CONFIDENTIAL 
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN 
AN OPEN SESSION, I'M NOT 
REVEALING SOMETHING THAT IS 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
>> I UNDERSTAND. 
I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT 
YOU HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND 
HAVE HAD SUBPOENAS. 
>> ACTUALLY, LET ME CLARIFY 
THAT. 
I'M ACTUALLY NOT AWARE OF A 
SUBPOENA. 
I THINK THERE MAY BE, BUT I'M 
NOT -- I KNOW THAT WE ARE 
WORKING WITH THEM. 
>> SIX MONTHS AGO, YOUR COUNSEL 
PROMISE THAT YOU ARE TAKING 
STEPS TO PREVENT FACEBOOK FROM 
SERVING WHAT IS CALLED AN 
UNWITTING CO-CONSPIRATOR, 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. 
BUT, THESE UNVERIFIED DIVISIVE 
PAGES ARE ON FACEBOOK TODAY. 
THEY LOOK A LOT LIKE THE 
ANONYMOUS GROUPS THE RUSSIAN 
AGENTS USED TO SPREAD 
PROPAGANDA DURING THE 2016 
ELECTION. 
ARE YOU ABLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER 
THEY ARE RUSSIAN CREATED 
GROUPS? 
YES OR NO. 
>> SENATOR, ARE YOU ASKING 
ABOUT THOSE SPECIFICALLY? 
>> YES. 
>> SENATOR, LAST WEEK WE 
ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED A MAJOR 
CHANGE TO OUR ADS AND PAGES 
POLICIES, THAT WE WILL BE 
VERIFYING THE IDENTITY OF EVERY 
SINGLE ADVERTISER. 
>> SPECIFIC ONES. 
DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE?  
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE 
PIECES OF CONTENT SPECIFICALLY. 
>> BUT IF YOU DECIDED THIS 
POLICY A WEEK AGO, YOU WOULD BE 
ABLE TO VERIFY THEM? 
>> WE ARE WORKING ON THAT NOW. 
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS, WE ARE 
GOING TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF 
ANY ADVERTISER WHO IS RUNNING 
APOLITICAL, OR ISSUE RELATED 
AD. 
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT  THE 
HONEST ADS ACT IS PROPOSING. 
AND, WE ARE FOLLOWING THAT. 
AND, WE ARE ALSO GOING TO DO 
THAT FOR PAGES.  
BUT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE 
SPECIFIC CASES. 
>> WILL YOU FIND OUT THE ANSWER 
AND GET BACK TO ME? 
>> I WILL HAVE MY TEAM GET BACK 
TO YOU. 
I DO THINK IT'S WORTH ADDING, 
THOUGH, THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO 
THE SAME VERIFICATION OF THE 
IDENTITY AND LOCATION OF ADMIN'S
WHO ARE RUNNING LARGE PAGES. 
SO THAT WAY, EVEN IF THEY 
AREN'T GOING TO BE BUYING ADS 
IN OUR SYSTEM, THAT WILL MAKE 
IT SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER FOR 
RUSSIAN  INTERFERENCE EFFORT, 
OR OTHER INAUTHENTIC EFFORTS, 
TO TRY TO SPREAD MISINFORMATION 
THROUGH THE NETWORK. 
>> AND IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 
SOME TIME. 
SOME MIGHT SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME. 
SIX MONTHS AGO, I ASKED GENERAL 
COUNSEL.FACEBOOK'S RULES FOR A 
BREEDING GROUND OF HATE SPEECH 
AGAINST ROHINGYA REFUGEES. 
A WEEK AGO, YOU BLAMED FACEBOOK 
FOR  THE GENOCIDE IN MYANMAR. 
AND THERE HAS BEEN GENOCIDE. 
YOU SAY THAT YOU USED AI TO 
FIND THIS.  
THIS IS A TYPE OF CONTENT THAT 
I'M REFERRING TO. 
IT CALLS FOR THE DEATH OF A 
MUSLIM JOURNALIST. 
NOW, THAT THREAT WENT STRAIGHT 
THROUGH YOUR DETECTION SYSTEMS, 
SPREAD VERY QUICKLY, AND THEN, 
IT TOOK ATTEMPT, AFTER ATTEMPT, 
AFTER ATTEMPT, AND INVOLVEMENT 
OF CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS, TO GET 
YOU TO REMOVE IT. 
WHY COULDN'T IT BE REMOVED 
WITHIN 24 HOURS? 
>> SENATOR, WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 
MYANMAR IS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. 
>> WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT. 
BUT, YOU AND INVESTIGATORS HAVE 
BLAMED FACEBOOK FOR PLAYING A 
ROLE IN THAT GENOCIDE. 
WE ALL AGREE IT'S TERRIBLE. 
HOW CAN YOU DEDICATE, AND WILL 
YOU DEDICATE THE RESOURCES THAT 
MAKES SURE SUCH HATE SPEECH IS 
TAKEN DOWN WITHIN 24 HOURS? 
>> YES, WE ARE WORKING ON THIS. 
THERE ARE THREE SPECIFIC THINGS 
WE ARE DOING. 
ONE IS, WE ARE HIRING DOZENS 
MORE BURMESE LANGUAGE CONTENT 
REVIEWERS. 
BECAUSE, HATE SPEECH IS VERY 
LANGUAGE SPECIFIC. 
IT'S HARD TO DO IT WITHOUT 
PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THE LOCAL 
LANGUAGE AND WE NEED TO RAMP UP 
OUR EFFORT THERE VERY 
DRAMATICALLY. 
SECOND IS, WE ARE WORKING WITH 
CIVIL SOCIETY IN MYANMAR TO 
IDENTIFY SPECIFIC HATE FIGURES, 
SO WE CAN TAKE DOWN THEIR 
ACCOUNTS, RATHER THAN SPECIFIC 
PIECES OF CONTENT. 
THIRD IS, WE ARE STANDING UP A 
PRODUCT TEAM TO DO SPECIFIC 
PRODUCT CHANGES IN MYANMAR AND 
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT MAY HAVE 
SIMILAR ISSUES IN THE FUTURE, 
TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. 
>> WHEN SENATOR CRUZ AND I SENT 
A LETTER TO APPLE,  ASKING WHAT 
THEY ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT 
CHINESE CENSORSHIP, -- MY 
QUESTION, I WILL PLACE FOR THE 
RECORD. 
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WILL DO 
ABOUT CHINESE CENSORSHIP WHEN 
THEY COME TO YOU. 
>> SENATOR GRAHAM IS UP NEXT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANDREW 
BOSWORTH? 
>> YES, SENATOR, I AM. 
>> HE SAYS, WE CONNECT MORE 
PEOPLE, MAYBE SOMEBODY DIES IN 
A TERRORIST ATTACK  COORDINATED 
ON OUR RULES. 
THE OF THE TRUTH IS THAT WE 
BELIEVE IN CONNECTING PEOPLE SO 
DEEPLY, THAT ANYTHING THAT 
ALLOWS US TO CONNECT PEOPLE 
MORE OFTEN IS DE FACTO GOOD. 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 
>> NO, SENATOR, I DO NOT. 
AND, IN CONTEXT, BOS WROTE THAT 
-- BOS IS WHAT WE CALL HIM 
INTERNALLY. 
HE WROTE THAT INTERNAL NOTE, 
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSION 
INTERNALLY.  
I DISAGREED WITH THAT AT THE 
TIME THAT HE WROTE IT. 
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE COMMENTS, 
 LOT OF PEOPLE INTERNALLY DID, 
TOO. 
>> DO YOU SAY THAT YOU DID A 
POOR JOB AS A CEO COMMUNICATING 
YOUR DISPLEASUE WITH SUCH 
THOUGHTS? 
BECAUSE IF HE HAD UNDERSTOOD 
WHERE YOU'RE AT, HE WOULD HAVE 
NEVER SAID IT TO BEGIN WITH. 
>> WELL SENATOR, WE TRY TO RUN 
OUR COMPANY IN A WAY WHERE 
PEOPLE CAN EXPRESS DIFFERENT 
OPINIONS INTERNALLY. 
>> WELL, THIS IS AN OPINION 
úTH 
AND IF SOMEBODY SAID THIS, I'D 
FIRE THEM. 
WHO IS YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITOR? 
>> SENATOR, WE HAVE A LOT OF 
COMPETITORS. 
>> WHO IS YOUR BIGGEST? 
>> DID YOU WANT JUST ONE? 
I'M NOT SURE I COULD GIVE JUST 
ONE. 
BUT, I COULD GIVE A BUNCH. 
THERE ARE THREE CATEGORIES I 
COULD FOCUS ON. 
ONE ARE THE OTHER TECH 
PLATFORMS, GOOGLE, APPLE, 
AMAZON, MICROSOFT. 
WE OVERLAP WITH THEM IN A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT WAYS. 
>> DO THEY PROVIDE THE SAME 
SERVICE YOU PROVIDE? 
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. 
IF I BUY A FORD AND IT DOES NOT 
WORK WELL AND I DON'T LIKE IT, 
I CAN BUY A CHEVY. 
IF I'M UPSET WITH FACEBOOK, 
WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT PRODUCT 
THAT I CAN GO AND SIGN UP FOR?  
>> THE SECOND CATEGORY I WAS 
GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS -- 
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT 
CATEGORIES. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT, IS THERE 
REAL COMPETITION THAT YOU FACE? 
CAR COMPANIES FACE A LOT OF 
COMPETITIONS. 
IF THEY MAKE A DEFECTIVE CAR, 
PEOPLE START BUYING ANOTHER 
ONE. 
IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE TO 
FACEBOOK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR? 
>> YES. 
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN USES EIGHT 
DIFFERENT APPS TO COMMUNICATE 
WITH FRIENDS AND STAY IN TOUCH 
WITH PEOPLE, RANGING FROM TEXT 
APPS AND EMAIL. 
>> WHICH IS THE SAME SERVICE 
YOU PROVIDE? 
>> WE PROVIDE A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT SERVICES. 
>> IS TWITTER THE SAME AS WHAT 
YOU DO? 
>> IT OVERLAPS. 
>> YOU DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A 
MONOPOLY? 
>> IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T FEEL 
THAT WAY TO ME. 
>> IT DOESN'T. 
SO, INSTAGRAM, YOU BOUGHT 
INSTAGRAM. 
WHY DID YOU BUY INSTAGRAM? 
>> BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY 
TALENTED APP DEVELOPERS MAKING 
GOOD USE OF OUR PLATFORM AND 
UNDERSTOOD OUR VALUES. 
>> A GOOD BUSINESS DECISION. 
MY POINT IS THAT, ONE WAY TO 
REGULATE A COMPANY IS THROUGH 
COMPETITION, THROUGH GOVERNMENT 
REGULATION. 
HERE'S THE QUESTION THAT ALL OF 
US GOT AN ANSWER. 
WHAT DO WE TELL OUR 
CONSTITUENTS, GIVEN WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED, WHY WE SHOULD LET YOU 
SELF REGULATE? 
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE IN 
SOUTH CAROLINA, GIVEN ALL OF 
THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED 
HERE, IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR US 
TO RELY UPON YOU TO REGULATE 
YOUR OWN BUSINESS PRACTICES? 
>> WELL SENATOR, MY POSITION IS 
NOT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO 
REGULATION. 
>> OKAY. 
DO YOU EMBRACE REGULATION? 
>> I THINK THE REAL QUESTION AS 
THE INTERNET BECOMES MORE 
IMPORTANT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES IS, 
WHAT IS THE RIGHT REGULATION? 
>> BUT DO YOU, AS A COMPANY, 
WELCOME REGULATION? 
>> I THINK IF IT'S THE RIGHT 
REGULATION, THEN YES. 
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THE 
EUROPEANS HAVE IT RIGHT? 
>> I THINK THAT THEY GET THINGS 
RIGHT. 
>> THAT'S TRUE. 
SO, WOULD YOU WORK WITH US IN 
TERMS OF WHAT REGULATIONS YOU 
THINK ARE NECESSARY IN YOUR 
INDUSTRY? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> OKAY. 
WOULD YOU SUBMIT TO US SOME 
PROPOSED REGULATIONS? 
>> YES. 
AND I WILL HAVE MY TEAM FOLLOW 
UP WITH YOU SO WE CAN DISCUSS 
ú 
CATEGORIES. 
>> LOOK FORWARD TO IT. 
WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR FACEBOOK, 
YOU SIGN UP FOR TERMS OF 
SERVICE. 
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT? 
>> YES. 
>> OKAY. 
IT SAYS, THE TERMS GOVERNING 
THE USE OF FACEBOOK AND ITS 
PRODUCTS, FEATURES, APPS, 
SERVICES, TECHNOLOGY, SOFTWARE 
WE OFFER, FACEBOOK PRODUCT OR 
PRODUCTS, EXCEPT WHERE WE 
EXPRESSLY STATE THAT SEPARATE 
TERMS AND THESE APPLY. 
I'M A LAWYER AND HAVE NO IDEA 
WHAT THAT MEANS. 
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT TERMS OF 
SERVICE, THIS IS WHAT YOU GET. 
DO YOU THINK THE AVERAGE 
CONSUMER UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY 
ARE SIGNING UP FOR? 
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THE 
AVERAGE PERSON LIKELY READ THAT 
WHOLE DOCUMENT. 
BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE 
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN 
COMMUNICATE THAT AND HAVE A 
RESPONSE TO DO SO. 
>> DO YOU AGREE THAT WE'VE GOT 
TO COME UP WITH OTHER WAYS 
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T WORKING? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK IN 
CERTAIN AREAS THAT IS TRUE. 
AND I THINK IN OTHER AREAS, 
LIKE THE CORE PART OF WHAT WE 
DO, IF YOU ARE THINKING AT THE 
MOST BASIC LEVEL, PEOPLE COME 
TO FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, 
WHATSAPP, MESSENGER ABOUT 100 
BILLION TIMES A DAY  TO SHARE A 
PIECE OF CONTENT OR A MESSAGE 
WITH A SPECIFIC SET OF PEOPLE. 
AND I THINK THAT THAT BASIC 
FUNCTIONALITY PEOPLE 
UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE 
CONTROLS IN LINE EVERY TIME. 
AND, GIVEN THE VOLUME OF THE 
ACTIVITY AND THE VALUE THE 
PEOPLE TELL US THEY ARE GETTING 
FROM THAT, I THINK THAT THAT 
CONTROL IN-LINE DOES SEEM TO BE 
WORKING FAIRLY WELL. 
NOW, WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER. 
AND THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES 
THAT ARE COMPLEX AND THERE IS 
MORE TO IT THAN JUST, YOU KNOW, 
YOU GO AND POST A PHOTO. 
SO I AGREE THE PLACES NEED TO 
DO BETTER. 
AS FOR THE CORE OF THE SERVICE, 
IT ACTUALLY IS QUITE CLEAR. 
>> THANK YOU. 
SENATOR KLOBUCHAR? 
>> I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREED 
THIS WAS A BREACH OF TRUST.  
THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THIS IS IF 
SOMEONE BREAKS INTO MY 
APARTMENT WITH A CROWBAR AND 
THEY TAKE MY STUFF, IT'S JUST 
LIKE IF THE MANAGER GAVE THEM 
THE KEYS OR IF THEY DID NOT 
HAVE ANY LOCKS ON THE DOORS, IT 
IS STILL A BREACH. 
IT IS STILL A BREAK IN. 
I BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE LAWS 
AND RULES THAT ARE 
SOPHISTICATED, AS THE BRILLIANT 
PRODUCTS THAT YOU HAVE 
DEVELOPED HERE. 
AND WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE THAT 
YET. 
AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I 
THINK WE FOCUSED ON IS THE 
ELECTION. 
AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT 
THAT YOU AND FACEBOOK, AND NOW 
TWITTER, HAVE GIVEN TO THE 
HONEST ADS ACT BILL, THAT I'M 
LEADING WITH SENATOR McCAIN AND 
SENATOR WARNER.  
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, AS WE WORK 
TO PASS THIS LAW, SO THAT WE 
HAVE THE SAME RULES IN PLACE TO 
DISCLOSE POLITICAL ADS AND 
ISSUE ADS AS WE DO FOR TV AND 
RADIO, AS WELL AS DISCLAIMERS, 
THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE EARLY 
ACTION AS SOON AS JUNE,  BEFORE 
THIS ELECTION, SO THAT PEOPLE 
CAN VIEW THESE ADS, INCLUDING 
ISSUE ADS, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> THAT IS CORRECT AND I WANT 
TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP  ON THIS. 
THIS, I THINK, IS AN IMPORTANT 
AREA FOR THE WHOLE INDUSTRY TO 
MOVE ON. 
THE TWO SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE 
ARE DOING OUR, ONE IS AROUND 
TRANSPARENCY. 
SO, NOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO GO AND CLICK ON ANY 
ADVERTISER OR ANY PAGE ON 
FACEBOOK AND SEE ALL OF THE ADS 
THAT THEY ARE RUNNING.  
THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS 
ADVERTISING ONLINE, ON 
FACEBOOK, TO AN EVEN HIGHER 
STANDARD THAN WHAT YOU WOULD 
HAVE ON TV OR PRINT MEDIA. 
BECAUSE THERE IS NOWHERE THAT 
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE TV ADS , 
FOR EXAMPLE. 
WHERE AS YOU WILL NOW BE ABLE 
TO SEE ON FACEBOOK WHETHER THIS 
CAMPAIGN OR THIRD PARTY IS 
SAYING DIFFERENT MESSAGES TO 
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE. 
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT 
ELEMENT OF TRANSPARENCY. 
THE OTHER IMPORTANT PIECE IS 
AROUND VERIFYING EVERY SINGLE 
ADVERTISER WHO IS GOING TO BE 
RUNNING POLITICAL OR ISSUE ADS. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 
AND, SENATOR WARREN AND I HAVE 
CALLED ON GOOGLE AND OTHER 
PLATFORMS TO DO THE SAME.  
SO A MEMO TO THE REST OF YOU, 
WE HAVE TO GET THIS DONE OR WE 
ARE GOING TO HAVE A PATCHWORK 
OF ADS. 
I HOPE YOU WILL BE WORKING WITH 
US TO PASS THIS BILL. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>> WE WILL.  
>> OKAY. 
NOW ON THE SUBJECT OF CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA, WERE THESE PEOPLE, 
THE 87 MILLION PEOPLE, USERS, 
CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN STATES? 
ARE YOU ABLE TO FIGURE OUT 
WHERE THEY ARE FROM? 
>> I DO NOT HAVE THAT 
INFORMATION WITH ME. 
BUT, WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR 
OFFICE. 
>> OKAY. 
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW, THE 
ELECTION WAS CLOSE, AND THERE 
WAS ONLY THOUSANDS OF VOTES IN 
CERTAIN STATES. 
YOU ALSO ESTIMATED THAT ROUGHLY 
126 MILLION PEOPLE MAY HAVE 
BEEN SHOWN CONTENT FROM A 
FACEBOOK PAGE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY. 
HAVE YOU DETERMINED WHETHER ANY 
OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE THE SAME 
FACEBOOK USERS WHOSE DATA WAS 
SHARED WITH CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA?
ARE YOU ABLE TO MAKE THAT 
DETERMINATION? 
>> SENATOR, WE ARE 
INVESTIGATING THAT NOW. 
WE BELIEVE IT IS ENTIRELY 
POSSIBLE THAT THERE WILL BE A 
CONNECTION THERE. 
>> OKAY, THAT SEEMS LIKE A BIG 
DEAL AS WE LOOK BACK AT THE 
LAST ELECTION. 
FORMER CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
EMPLOYEE CHRISTOPHER WILEY HAS 
SAID THAT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
IMPROPERLY OBTAINED DATA FROM 
FACEBOOK USERS THAT COULD BE 
STORED IN RUSSIA. 
DO YOU AGREE THAT THAT IS A 
POSSIBILITY? 
>> SORRY, ARE YOU ASKING IF 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA'S DATA 
COULD BE STORED IN RUSSIA? 
>> THAT'S WHAT HE SAID THIS 
WEEKEND ON A SUNDAY SHOW. 
>> SENATOR, I DON'T HAVE ANY 
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT. 
BUT ONE OF THE STEPS THAT WE 
NEED TO TAKE NOW IS GO TO A 
FULL AUDIT OF ALL OF CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA'S SYSTEMS TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE DOING, 
WHETHER THEY STILL HAVE ANY 
DATA, TO MAKE SURE THEY REMOVE 
THE DATA AND IF THEY DON'T, WE 
ARE GOING TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION 
AGAINST THEM TO DO SO. 
THAT AUDIT, WE HAVE TEMPORARILY 
 
UK GOVERNMENT COMPLETE THEIR 
INVESTIGATION FIRST BECAUSE 
THAT TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER A 
COMPANY DOING THAT. 
BUT, WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
COMPLETING THIS FULL AUDIT AND 
GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT'S 
GOING ON HERE SO THAT WAY WE 
CAN HAVE MORE ANSWERS TO THIS. 
>> OKAY, EARLIER YOU STATED 
PUBLICLY AND HEAR THAT YOU 
WOULD SUPPORT SOME PRIVACY 
RULES, SO THAT EVERYONE IS 
PLAYING BY THE SAME RULES HERE. 
AND YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU 
SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED CUSTOMERS 
EARLIER. 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT A RULE THAT 
WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO NOTIFY 
YOUR USERS OF A BREACH WITHIN 
72 HOURS? 
>> SENATOR, THAT MAKES SENSE TO 
ME. 
AND, I THINK THAT WE SHOULD 
HAVE OUR TEAM PULL UP WITH 
YOURS, TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS 
AROUND THAT MORE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I JUST SING PART OF THIS WAS 
THAT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T EVEN 
KNOW THAT THEIR DATA HAS BEEN 
BREACHED, THAT IS A HUGE 
PROBLEM. 
AND I THINK THAT WE GET TO 
SOLUTIONS FASTER WHEN THERE IS 
A HUGE PROBLEM OUT THERE. 
THANK YOU. 
WE WOULD LOVE TO PASS THIS BILL 
BEFORE THE HONEST ELECTION ON 
THE ADS, AND LOOKING FORWARD TO 
BETTER DISCLOSURE OF THIS 
ELECTION. 
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, NICE TO SEE 
YOU. 
WHEN I SAW YOU NOT TOO LONG 
AFTER  I ENTERED THE SENATE IN 
2011, I TOLD YOU WHEN I SENT MY 
BUSINESS CARDS DOWN TO BE 
PRINTED, THEY CAME BACK FROM 
THE SENATE PRINT SHOP WITH A 
MESSAGE, THAT WAS THE FIRST 
BUSINESS CARD THEY HAD EVER 
PRINTED A FACEBOOK ADDRESS ON, 
THERE ARE DAYS WHEN I HAVE 
REGRETTED THAT, BUT MORE DAYS 
WHEN WE GET LOTS OF INFORMATION
, WE NEED TO GET, I WONDER IF 
THE FACEBOOK FRIENDS IS A 
LITTLE MISSTATED. 
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE I HAVE 
THOSE EVERY SINGLE DAY. 
BUT YOU KNOW, THE PLATFORM YOU 
HAVE CREATED IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT. 
MY SON, CHARLIE, WHO IS 13, IS 
DEDICATED TO INSTAGRAM. 
HE WOULD WANT TO BE SURE THAT I 
MENTIONED HIM WHILE I WAS HERE 
WITH YOU. 
I HAVEN'T PRINTED THAT ON MY 
CARD WITH YOU. 
BUT I WILL SAY THAT. 
I THINK WE HAVE THAT ACCOUNT AS 
WELL. 
LOTS OF WAYS TO CONNECT PEOPLE. 
AND THE INFORMATION, OBVIOUSLY, 
IS AN IMPORTANT COMMODITY. 
AND, IT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR 
BUSINESS WORK. 
I GET THAT. 
HOWEVER, I WONDER ABOUT SOME OF 
THE COLLECTION EFFORTS. 
AND MAYBE WE CAN GO THROUGH 
LARGELY EVEN JUST YES OR NO, 
AND THEN GET BACK TO MORE 
EXPANSIVE DISCUSSIONS OF THIS. 
BUT, DO YOU COLLECT USER DATA 
THROUGH CROSS DEVICE TRACKING? 
>> SENATOR, I BELIEVE WE DO 
LINK PEOPLE'S ACCOUNTS BETWEEN 
DEVICES, IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THERE FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, 
AND OTHER EXPERIENCES CAN BE 
SYNCED BETWEEN DEVICES. 
>> THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE OFF-
LINE DATA? 
DATA TRACKING THAT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY LINKED TO FACEBOOK, 
BUT LINKED TO SOME DEVICE THEY 
WENT THROUGH FACEBOOK ON. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>> SENATOR, I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
I GET THIS RIGHT. 
I WANT TO HAVE MY TEAM GET WITH 
YOU AFTERWARDS. 
>> THAT DOESN'T SEEM THAT 
COMPLICATED TO ME. 
YOU UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER THAN 
I DO. 
MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY 
THAT IS COMPLICATED. 
DO YOU TRACK DEVICES THAT AN 
INDIVIDUAL WHO USES FACEBOOK 
HAS, THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE 
DEVICE THAT THEY USE FOR THEIR 
FACEBOOK CONNECTION, BUT NOT 
NECESSARILY CONNECTED TO 
FACEBOOK? 
>> I'M NOT SURE OF THE ANSWER 
TO THAT QUESTION. 
>> REALLY? 
>> YES. 
THERE MAY BE SOME DATA THAT IS 
NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE 
SERVICE THAT WE DO. 
BUT, I DON'T HAVE THAT SITTING 
HERE TODAY. 
SO THAT IS SOMETHING I WOULD 
WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON. 
>> NOW, THE FTC LAST YEAR 
FLAGGED CROSS DEVICE TRACKING 
AS ONE OF THEIR CONCERNS. 
GENERALLY, THAT PEOPLE ARE 
TRACKING DEVICES, THAT THE 
USERS OF SOMETHING LIKE FACEBOOK
DON'T KNOW THAT ARE BEING 
TRACKED. 
HOW DO YOU DISCLOSE YOUR 
COLLECTION METHODS? 
IS THAT ALL IN THIS DOCUMENT 
THAT I WOULD SEE AND AGREE TO 
BEFORE I ENTER INTO FACEBOOK? 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
THERE ARE TWO WAYS THAT WE DO 
THIS. 
ONE IS, WE TRY TO BE EXHAUSTIVE 
IN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS AROUND 
THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND 
PRIVACY POLICIES. 
BUT MORE IMPORTANT, WE TRY TO 
PROVIDE IN-LINE CONTROLS, THAT 
ARE IN PLAIN ENGLISH, SO THAT 
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. 
THEY CAN EITHER GO TO SETTINGS 
WHERE WE CAN SHOW THEM AT THE 
TOP OF THE APP PERIODICALLY. 
SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ALL 
THE CONTROLS AND SETTINGS THAT 
THEY HAVE, AND CAN CONFIGURE 
THEIR EXPERIENCE THE WAY THAT 
THEY WANT. 
>> SO, DO PEOPLE NOW GIVE YOU 
PERMISSION TO TRACK SPECIFIC 
DEVICES IN THEIR CONTRACT? 
AND IF THEY DO, IS THAT A 
RELATIVELY NEW ADDITION TO WHAT 
YOU DO? 
OR AM I ABLE TO OPT OUT? 
AM I ABLE TO SAY, IT'S OKAY FOR 
YOU TO TRACK WHAT I'M SAYING ON 
FACEBOOK, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU 
TO TRACK WHAT I'M TEXTING TO 
SOMEBODY ELSE OFF FACEBOOK, ON 
AN ANDROID? 
>> OH, OKAY. 
YES, SENATOR. 
IN GENERAL, FACEBOOK IS NOT 
COLLECTING DATA FROM OTHER APPS 
THAT YOU USE. 
THERE MAY BE SOME SPECIFIC 
THINGS ABOUT THE DEVICE THAT 
YOU ARE USING THAT FACEBOOK 
NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND IN ORDER TO 
OFFER THE SERVICE. 
BUT, IF YOU ARE USING GOOGLE, 
OR YOU ARE USING SOME TEXTING AT
, UNLESS YOU SPECIFICALLY OPT IN
THAT YOU WANT TO SHARE THE 
TEXTING APP INFORMATION, 
FACEBOOK WOULDN'T SEE THAT. 
>> HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY? 
OR IS THAT A RECENT ADDITION TO 
HOW YOU DEAL WITH THOSE OTHER 
WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT COMMUNICATE?
>> SENATOR, MY UNDERSTANDING IS 
THAT THAT IS HOW THE MOBILE 
OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE ARCHITECT.
>> SO, YOU DON'T HAVE BUNDLED 
PERMISSIONS FOR HOW I CAN AGREE 
TO WHAT DEVICES I MAY USE, THAT 
YOU MAY HAVE CONTACT WITH? 
DO YOU BUNDLE THAT PERMISSION? 
OR AM I ABLE TO INDIVIDUALLY SAY
WHAT I'M WILLING FOR YOU TO 
WATCH, AND WHAT I DON'T WANT 
YOU TO WATCH? 
AND I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE 
THAT FOR THE RECORD, BASED ON 
EVERYBODY ELSE'S TIME. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, WOULD YOU BE 
COMFORTABLE SHARING WITH US THE 
NAME OF THE HOTEL YOU STAYED IN 
LAST NIGHT?  
>> NO. 
>> IF YOU HAVE MESSAGED ANYBODY 
THIS WEEK, WOULD YOU SHARE WITH 
US THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE YOU 
HAVE MESSAGED? 
>> SENATOR, NO, I WOULD 
PROBABLY NOT CHOOSE TO DO THAT 
PUBLICLY HERE. 
>> I THINK THAT MAYBE WHAT THIS 
IS ALL ABOUT. 
YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY. 
THE LIMITS OF YOUR RIGHT TO 
PRIVACY. 
AND HOW MUCH YOU GIVE AWAY IN 
MODERN AMERICA, IN THE NAME OF, 
QUOTE, CONNECTING PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD. 
THE QUESTION BASICALLY OF, WHAT 
INFORMATION FACEBOOK IS 
COLLECTING, WHO THEY ARE 
SENDING IT TO, AND WHETHER THEY 
HAVE ASKED ME IN ADVANCE. 
MY PERMISSION TO DO THAT. 
IS THAT A FAIR THING FOR A USER 
OF FACEBOOK TO EXPECT? 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE 
CONTROL OVER HOW THE 
INFORMATION IS USED. 
AND AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN 
SOME OF THEIR OTHER QUESTIONS, 
I THINK THAT IS LAID OUT IN 
SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS. 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU WANT 
TO GIVE PEOPLE CONTROL IN THE 
PRODUCT ITSELF. 
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT WAY THAT 
THIS HAPPENS ACROSS OUR SERVICES
IS, THAT EVERY DAY, PEOPLE COME 
TO OUR SERVICES TO CHOOSE TO 
SHARE PHOTOS OR SEND MESSAGES. 
AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY 
CHOOSE TO SHARE SOMETHING, THEY 
HAVE A CONTROL RIGHT THERE 
ABOUT WHO THEY WANT TO SHARE IT 
WITH. 
BUT THAT LEVEL OF CONTROL IS 
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. 
>> THEY 
>> YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE 
DEVELOPER PLATFORM AND I WILL 
GIVE YOU BACKGROUND IF THAT IS 
USEFUL. 
>> I HAVE THREE MINUTES LESS 
AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF 
QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK. 
YOU HAVE ANNOUNCED SOMETHING 
THAT IS CALLED MESSENGER KIDS.  
THERE IS AN APP FOR KIDS 6 AND 
12 TO SEND VIDEO TEXT MESSAGES 
AND YOU HAVE CARTOON  FEATURES 
FOR THIS.  
AND THERE IS CHILDHOOD 
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS THAT 
WARNED FACEBOOK AND 
DEMONSTRATED THAT EXCESSIVE USE 
OF DIGITAL DEVICES AND SOCIAL 
MEDIA IS HARMFUL TO KIDS AND 
ARGUED THAT YOUNG CHILDREN ARE 
NOT READY TO HANDLE SOCIAL 
MEDIA ACCOUNTS AT AGE 6. 
IN ADDITION THERE ARE CONCERNS 
ABOUT DATA BEING GATHERED ABOUT 
THESE KIDS.  
NOW THERE IS CERTAIN LIMITS IN 
THE LAW, WE KNOW, CHILDREN'S 
ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT.  
WHAT GUARANTEES CAN YOU GIVE US 
THAT NO DATA FROM MESSENGER 
KIDS WILL BE COLLECTED OR 
SHARED WITH THOSE THAT MIGHT 
VIOLATE THAT LAW? 
>> ALL RIGHT.  
SENATOR, SO A NUMBER OF THINGS 
I THINK ARE IMPORTANT HERE.  
BACKGROUND ON MESSENGER KIDS IS 
THAT WE HEARD FEEDBACK FROM 
THOUSANDS OF PARENTS THAT THEY 
WANT TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN 
TOUCH WITH THEIR KIDS AND CALL 
THEM AND USE APPS LIKE FACEBOOK 
WHEN THEY ARE WORKING LATE AND 
NOT AROUND SO THEY WANT 
CONTROL.  
WE CAN AGREE IF YOUR KID IS 6 
OR 7 AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A 
PHONE YOU WANT TO CONTROL WHO 
THEY CONTACT AND THERE WAS NOT 
AN APP OUT THERE THAT DID THAT 
SO WE BILL THIS SERVICE.  
THE APP COLLECTS A MINIMAL 
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO 
OPERATE IT.  
THE MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE SEND 
IS SOMETHING THAT WE COLLECT TO 
OPERATE THE SERVICE AND IN 
GENERAL THAT DATA WON'T BE 
SHARED WITH 3rd PARTIES AND NOT 
CONNECTED TO THE BROADER 
FACEBOOK -- 
>> EXCUSE ME, AS A LAWYER I 
PICKED UP ON THAT WORD IN 
GENERAL, THAT PHRASE IN 
GENERAL, IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST IN 
SOME CASES IT WILL BE SHARED 
WITH THIRD PARTIES. 
>> NO, IT WILL NOT. 
>> ALL RIGHT.  
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO THE IDEA 
THAT SOMEONE HAVING REACHED 
ADULT AGE AND HAVING GROWN UP 
WITH MESSENGER KIDS SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO DELETE THE DATA THAT 
YOU COLLECTED? 
>> YES. 
AS A MATTER OF FACT WHEN YOU 
BECOME 13, OUR LIMIT WHERE WE 
DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE UNDER THE 
AGE OF 13 TO USE FACEBOOK, YOU 
DON AUTOMATICALLY GO FR 
HAVING A MESSENGER KID APP BUT 
START OVER.  
IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE SURE 
IT IS DELETED AND PEOPLE WILL 
START OVER WHEN THEY GET THEIR 
FACEBOOK OR OTHER ACCOUNTS. 
>> ILLINOIS HAS A BIOMETRIC 
INFORMATION ACT, OUR STATE DOES 
WHICH IS TO REGULATE THE 
COMMERCIAL USE OF FACIAL AND 
IRI SETTLEMENT SCANS AND THE 
LIKE. 
FACEBOOK HAS THE EXCEPTION TO 
THAT.  
I HOPE YOU WILL FILL ME IN ON 
THAT PROTECTING PRIVACY. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> SENATOR CORNNIN.  
I KNOW UP UNTIL 2014 THE MONTRA 
OF FACEBOOK WAS TO MOVE FAST 
AND BREAK THINGS, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>> I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE CHANGED 
IT BUT THE MONTRA IS CURRENTLY 
MOVE FAST WITH FAST WITH STABLE 
INFRASTRUCTURE. 
>> THAT SOUNDS MORE BORING BUT 
MY QUESTION IS DURING THE TIME 
THAT IT WAS FACEBOOK'S MONTRA 
OR MOTTO TO MOVE FAST AND BREAK 
THINGS, DO YOU THINK SOME OF 
THE MISJUDGMENTS PERHAPS, 
MISTAKES THAT YOU HAVE ADMITTED 
TO HERE WERE AS A RESULT OF 
THAT CULTURE OR THAT ATTITUDE 
PARTICULARLY IN REGARDS TO 
PERSONAL PRIVACY OF INFORMATION 
OF YOUR SUBSCRIBERS? 
>> SENATOR, I DO THINK THAT WE 
MADE MISTAKES BECAUSE OF THAT 
BUT THE BROADEST MISTAKES THAT 
WE MADE HERE ARE NOT TAKING A 
BROAD ENOUGH VIEW OF OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY.  
THE MOVE FAST CULTURAL VALUE IS 
MORE TACTICAL AROUND WHETHER 
ENGINEERS CAN SHIP THINGS AND 
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE OPERATE. 
BUT I THINK THE BIG MISTAKE 
THAT WE MADE LOOKING BACK ON 
THIS IS VIEWING OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY AS JUST BUILDING 
TOOLS RATHER THAN VIEWING OUR 
WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY AS MAKING 
SURE THAT THE TOOLS ARE USED 
FOR GOOD. 
>> WELL I APPRECIATE THAT. 
BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY OR EARLY -- 
IN THE PAST WE HAVE BEEN TOLD 
THAT PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK, 
TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM AND THE 
LIKE ARE NEUTRAL PLATFORMS AND 
THE PEOPLE THAT OWN AND RUN 
THOSE FOR PROFIT AND I AM NOT 
CRITICIZING DOING SOMETHING FOR 
PROFIT IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT 
THEY BOR NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THE CONTENT.  
DO YOU AGREE NOW THAT FACEBOOK 
AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA 
PLATFORMS ARE NOT NEUTRAL BUT 
BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THE CONTENT? 
>> I AGREE THAT WE ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT. 
AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BIG 
SOCIETAL QUESTIONS THAT I THINK 
WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO ANSWER 
IS THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK THAT 
WE HAVE IS BASED ON THIS 
REACTIVE MODEL THAT ASSUMES 
THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY TOOLS 
THAT WOULD PROACTIVELY TELL 
WHETHER SOMETHING WAS TERRORIST 
CONTENT OR SOMETHING BAD SO IT 
NATURALLY RELIED ON REQUIRING 
PEOPLE TO FLAG FOR A COMPANY 
AND THE COMPANY NEEDING TO TAKE 
REASONABLE ACTION.  
IN THE FUTURE, WE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TOOLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO IDENTIFY MORE TYPES OF 
BAD CONTENT AND THERE ARE MORAL 
AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND 
QUESTIONS THAT I THINK WE WILL 
HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH AS A 
SOCIETY ABOUT WHEN WE WANT TO 
REQUIRE COMPANIES TO TAKE 
ACTION, PROACTIVELY ON CERTAIN 
OF THOSE THINGS.  
AND WHEN THAT GETS IN THE WAY 
-- 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.  
I HAVE TWO MINUTES LEFT TO ASK 
YOU QUESTIONS.  
SO INTERESTINGLY THE TERMS OF 
THE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, THE 
TERMS OF SERVICE IS A LEGAL 
DOCUMENT THAT DISCLOSES TO YOUR 
SUBSCRIBERS HOW THE INFORMATION 
IS USED AND HOW FACEBOOK WILL 
OPERATE.  
BUT YOU CONCEDE THAT YOU DOUBT 
EVERYONE READS OR UNDERSTANDS 
THAT LEGALESE, THOSE TERMS OF 
SERVICE SO IS THAT TO SUGGEST 
THAT THE CONSENT THAT PEOPLE 
GIVE SUBJECT TO THAT TERMS OF 
SERVICE IS NOT INFORMED 
CONSENT? 
IN OTHER WORDS THEY MAY NOT 
READ IT AND IF THEY DON'T READ 
IT, THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND IT? 
>> I THINK WE HAVE A BROADER 
RESPONSIBILITY THAN WHAT THE 
LAW REQUIRES SO -- 
>> I'M TALKING -- I APPRECIATE 
THAT.  
WHAT I'M ASKING ABOUT IN TERMS 
OF WHAT YOUR SUBSCRIBERS 
UNDERSTAND IN TERMS OF HOW THE 
DATA WILL BE USED.  
BUT LET ME GO TO THE TERMS OF 
SERVICE UNDER PARAGRAPH NUMBER 
2, YOU SAY YOU OWN ALL OF THE 
CONTENT AND INFORMATION YOU 
POST ON FACEBOOK.  
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD US 
HERE TODAY A NUMBER OF TIMES.  
SO IF I CHOOSE TO TERMINATE MY 
FACEBOOK ACCOUNT, CAN I BAR 
FACEBOOK OR ANY THIRD PARTY 
FROM USING THE DATA THAT I HAD 
PREVIOUSLY SUPPLIED FOR ANY 
PURPOSE WHATSOEVER? 
>> YES, SENATOR.  
IF YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT WE 
SHOULD GET RID OF ALL YOUR 
INFORMATION. 
>> YOU SHOULD OR DO YOU. 
>> WE DO. 
>> HOW ABOUT THIRD PARTIES THAT 
YOU HAVE CONTRACTED WITH TO USE 
SOME OF THAT UNDERLYING 
INFORMATION PERHAPS TO TARGET 
ADVERTISING FOR THEMSELVES?  
YOU CAN'T -- DO YOU -- DO YOU 
GET BACK THAT INFORMATION AS 
WELL OR DOES THAT REMAIN IN 
THEIR CUSTODY? 
>> SENATOR, THIS IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I'M GLAD 
YOU BROUGHT THIS UP BECAUSE 
THERE IS A VERY COMMON 
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT FACEBOOK 
THAT WE SELL DATA TO 
ADVERTISERS.  
AND WE DO NOT SELL DATA TO 
ADVERTISERS. 
>> YOU CLEARLY RENT IT. 
>> WE ALLOW ADVERTISERS TO TELL 
US WHO THEY WANT TO REACH AND 
WE DO THE PLACEMENT.  
SO IF AN ADVERTISER COMES TO US 
AND SAY I AM A SKI SHOP AND I 
WANT TO SELL SKIS TO WOMEN THEN 
WE MIGHT HAVE SOME SENSE 
BECAUSE PEOPLE SHARED SKIING-
RELATED CONTENT INTEREST IN 
THAT AND THEY WERE A WOMAN AND 
WE COULD SHOW THE ADS WITHOUT 
THAT DATA GOING TO THE 
ADVERTISER.  
THIS IS A A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF 
OUR MOTTO AND MISUNDERSTOOD.  
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT 
THAT UP. 
>> THANK YOU SENATOR CORENIN. 
>> WE INDICATED THAT WE WOULD 
TAKE A COUPLE OF BREAKS AND 
GIVE OUR WITNESS AN OPPORTUNITY 
AND WE HAVE BEEN GOING FOR 
UNTWO HOURS, I THINK -- 
>> WE CAN DO A FEW MORE. 
>> YOU WANT TO KEEP GOING? 
>> MAYBE 15 MINUTES. 
>> OKAY. 
>> DOES THAT WORK? 
>> WE WILL KEEP GOING.  
SENATOR BLOOMENTHAL IS UP NEXT. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN FOR 
BEING HERE TODAY MR. 
ZUCKERBERG.  
YOU HAVE TOLD US TODAY AND YOU 
HAVE TOLD THE WORLD THAT 
FACEBOOK WAS DECEIVED BY 
ALEXANDER COLGAN WHEN HE SOLD 
INFORMATION TO CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA, CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE TERMS 
OF SERVICE THAT ALEXANDER 
COLDGAN PROVIDED TO FACEBOOK. 
AND NOTE FOR YOU THAT IN FACT 
FACEBOOK WAS ON NOTICE THAT HE 
COULD SELL THAT USER 
INFORMATION.  
HAVE YOU SEEN THESE TERMS OF 
SERVICE BEFORE? 
>> I HAVE NOT. 
>> WHO IN FACEBOOK WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEING THOSE 
TERMS OF SERVICE THAT PUT 
OUTSTANDING NOTICE THAT THAT 
INFORMATION COULD BE SOLD? 
>> SENATOR, OUR APP REVIEW TEAM 
WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. 
>> HAS ANYONE BEEN FIRED ON 
THAT APP REVIEW TEAM? 
>> SENATOR, NOT BECAUSE OF 
THIS. 
>> DOESN'T THAT TERM OF SERVICE 
CONFLICT WITH THE FTC ORDER 
THAT FACEBOOK WAS UNDER AT THAT 
VERY TIME THAT THIS TERM OF 
SERVICE WAS IN FACT PROVIDED TO 
FACEBOOK AND YOU'LL NOTE THAT 
THE FTC ORDER ORDERS THEM TO 
PROTECT PRIVACY, ISN'T THAT A 
CONFLICT? 
>> SENATOR, IT CERTAINLY 
APPEARS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN AWARE THAT THIS APP 
DEVELOPER SUBMITTED A TERM THAT 
WAS IN CONFLICT WITH THE RULES 
OF THE PLATFORM. 
>> WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS IN 
EFFECT WILLFUL BLINDNESS.  
IT WAS HEEDLESS AND RECKLESS 
WHICH IN FACT AMOUNTED TO A 
VIOLENCE OF THE FTC CONSENT 
DECREE, WOULD YOU AGREE? 
>> NO, SENATOR.  
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS 
NOT THAT THIS WAS A VIOLENCE OF 
THE CONSENT DECREE BUT AS I 
HAVE SAID A NUMBER OF TIMES 
TODAY I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A 
BROADER VIEW AND RESPONSIBILITY 
ABOUT THE PRIVACY. 
>> HERE IS MY RESERVATION, MR. 
ZUCKERBERG, I APOLOGY FOR 
INTERRUPTING BUT MY TIME IS 
LIMITED.  
WE HAVE SEEN THE APOLOGY TOURS 
BEFORE.  
YOU HAVE REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
EVEN AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO 
HAVE REPORTED THIS VIOLENCE OF 
THE FTC CONSENT DECREE AND WE 
HAVE LETTERS AND WE HAVE HAD 
CONTACTS WITH FACEBOOK 
EMPLOYEES AND I'M GOING TO 
SUBMIT A LETTER FOR THE RECORD 
FROM SANDY PARAKEELIS WITH YOUR 
PERMISSION.  
THAT INDICATES NOT ONLY A LACK 
OF RESOURCES BUT LACK OF 
ATTENTION TO PRIVACY.  
AND SO MY RESERVATION ABOUT 
YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY IS THAT I 
DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN CHANGE 
YOUR BUSINESS MOTTO UNLESS 
THERE ARE SPECIFIC RULES OF THE 
ROAD.  
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO 
MAXIMIZE PRIVATE OVER PRIVACY 
AND UNLESS THERE ARE SPECIFIC 
RULES AND REQUIREMENTS ENFORCED 
BY AN OUTSIDE AGENCY, I HAVE NO 
ASSURANCE THAT THESE KINDS OF 
VAGUE COMMITMENTS ARE GOING TO 
PRODUCE ACTION.  
SO I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE 
OF VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND 
THEY ARE BASED ON LEGISLATION 
THAT I HAVE OFFERED, MY DATA 
ACT THAT SENATOR MARKIN IS 
INTRODUCING THE CONSENT APP.  
DON'T YOU THINK THAT PLAIN 
INFORMATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED 
ABOUT HOW DATA WILL BE USED AND 
SPECIFIC ABILITY TO CONSENT TO 
THE USE OF THAT INFORMATION? 
>> SENATOR, I DO GENERALLY 
AGREE WITH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING 
AND I LAID THAT OUT EARLIER -- 
>> WOULD YOU AGREE TO AN OPT IN 
AS OPPOSED TO AN OPT OUT? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT 
CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE TO 
DISCUSS AND I THINK THE DETAILS 
AROUND THIS MATTER A LOT. 
>> DO YOU AGREE THAT USERS 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OF 
THEIR INFORMATION? 
>> SENATOR, YES, OF COURSE. 
>> ALL OF THE INFORMATION YOU 
COLLECT AS A RESULT OF 
PURCHASING FROM DATA BROKERS 
AND AS WELL AS TRACKING THEM. 
>> SENATOR, WE HAVE ALREADY 
DOWNLOAD YOUR INFORMATION TOOL 
THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SEE AND 
TO TAKE OUT ALL OF THE 
INFORMATION THAT FACEBOOK -- 
THAT THEY HAVE PUT INTO 
FACEBOOK OR THAT FACEBOOK KNOWS 
ABOUT THAT.  
WE HAVE THAT ALREADY. 
>> I HAVE A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC 
REQUESTS THAT YOU AGREE TO 
SUPPORT AS PART OF LEGISLATION. 
I THINK LEGISLATION IS 
NECESSARY, THE RULES OF THE 
ROAD HAVE TO BE THE RESULT OF 
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION.  
WE HAVE -- FACEBOOK HAS 
PARTICIPATED RECENTLY IN THE 
FIGHT AGAINST THE SCOURGE OF 
SEX TRAFFICKING AND THE BILL 
THAT WE'VE JUST PASSED AND 
SIGNED INTO LAW TOMORROW, THE 
STOP EXPLOITING SEX TRAFFICKING 
ACT WAS THE RSULT OF OUR 
COOPERATION.  
I HOPE THAT WE CAN COOPERATE ON 
THIS KIND OF MEASURE AS WELL. 
>> SENATOR, I LOOK FORWARD TO 
HAVING MY TEAMWORK WERE YOU ON 
THIS. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR.  
SENATOR CRUZ. 
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
ZUCKERBERG DOES FACEBOOK 
CONSIDER ITSELF A NEUTRAL 
FORUM. 
>> WE CONSIDER OURSELVES TO BE 
A PLATFORM FOR ALL IDEAS. 
>> LET ME ASK THE QUESTION 
AGAIN.  
DOES FACEBOOK CONSIDER ITSELF 
TO BE A NEUTRAL FORUM AND 
REPRESENTATIVES OF YOUR COMPANY 
HAVE GIVEN CONFLICTING ANSWERS, 
ARE YOU A FIRST AMENDMENT 
SPEAKER EXPRESSING VIEWS OR A 
NEUTRAL FORUM ALLOWING EVERYONE 
TO SPEAK? 
>> SENATOR HERE IS HOW WE THINK 
ABOUT THIS.  
THERE IS CERTAIN CONTENT THAT 
CLEARLY WE DO NOT ALLOW.  
HATE SPEECH, TERRORIST CONTENT, 
NUDITY, ANYTHING THAT MAKES 
PEOPLE FEEL UNSAFE IN 
COMMUNITY.  
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, THAT'S 
WHY WE GENERALLY TRY TO REFER 
TO WHAT WE DO AS A PLATFORM. 
>> LET ME TRY BECAUSE THE TIME 
IS CONSTRAINED.  
JUST A SIMPLE QUESTION, THE 
PREDICATE FOR SECTION 230 
IMMUNITY UNDER THE CDA IS THAT 
YOU ARE A NEUTRAL PUBLIC FORUM 
DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A 
NEUTRAL PUBLIC FORUM OR ENGAGED 
IN POLITICAL SPEECH WHICH IS 
YOUR RIGHT UNDER THE 1st 
AMENDMENT. 
>> OUR GOAL IS NOT TO ENGAGE IN 
POLITICAL SPEECH.  
I AM NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH THE 
SPECIFIC LEGAL LAKE OF THE LAW 
THAT YOU SPEAK TO SO I WOULD 
NEED TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON 
THAT.  
I'M JUST TRYING TO LAY OUT HOW 
BRADLEY I THINK ABOUT THIS. 
>> MR. YOUNG YUCK I  -- 
ZUCKERBERG, THERE ARE A GREAT 
NUMBER OF AMERICANS THAT ARE 
DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT FACEBOOK 
AND OTHER TECH COMPANIES ARE 
ENGAGED IN A PERVASIVE PATTERN 
OF BIAS AND POLITICAL 
CENSORSHIP. 
NUMEROUS INSTANCES WITH 
FACEBOOK, IT WAS REPORTED THAT 
FACEBOOK HAD ROUTINLY 
SUPPRESSED CONSERVATIVE STORIES 
FROM TRENDING NEWS INCLUDING 
STORIES ABOUT C PACK AND MITT 
ROMNEY AND INCLUDING STORIES 
ABOUT THE LOWEST LEARNER IRS 
SCANDAL AND STORIES ABOUT GLEN 
BECK, IN ADDITION TO THAT, 
FACEBOOK HAS INITIALLY SHUT 
DOWN THE CHICK-FIL-A 
APPRECIATION DAY PAGE AND HAS 
BLOCKED A POST OF FOX NEWS 
REPORTER AND HAS BLOCKED OVER 
2,000 FACEBOOK PAGES AND 
TRUMP'S DIME AND SILK PAGE WITH 
1.2 MILLION FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS 
AFTER DETERMINING THE CONTENT 
AND BRAN WERE UNSAFE TO THE 
COMMUNITY TO A GREAT NUMBER OF 
AMERICANS THAT APPEARINGS TO BE 
PERVASIVE PATTERN OF POLITICAL 
BIAS, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
ASSESSMENT? 
>> SENATOR, LET ME SAY A FEW 
THINGS ABOUT THIS.  
FIRST, I UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT 
CONCERN IS COMING FROM BECAUSE 
FACEBOOK AND THE TECH INDUSTRY 
ARE LOCATED IN SILICON VALLEY 
THAT IS EXTREMELY LEFT WINGING 
PLACE.  
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A CONCERN 
THAT I HAVE AND THAT I TRY TO 
ROOT OUT AND THE COMPANY IS 
MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE 
ANY BIAS IN THE WORK THAT WE DO 
AND I THINK THAT IT IS A FAIR 
CONCERN THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD 
-- 
>> SO LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION. 
ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY AD OR PAGE 
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN FROM 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD? 
>> SENATOR, I AM NOT. 
>> HOW ABOUT I MOVE ON. 
>> SORRY. 
>> HOW MOVE ON DOT ORGANIZE. 
>> I AM NOT AWARE. 
>> IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAY 
THAT YOU HAVE 15 TO 20,000 
PEOPLE WORKING ON SECURITY AND 
CONTENT REVIEW. 
DO YOU KNOW THE POLITICAL 
ORIENTATION OF THOSE 15 TO 
20,000 PEOPLE ENGAGED IN 
CONSENT REVIEW. 
>> WE DON'T ASK PEOPLE ABOUT 
THEIR POLITICAL ORGANIZATION 
JOINING THE COMPANY. 
>> AS CEO HAVE YOU MADE HIRING 
OR FIRING POSITIONS BASED ON 
POLITICAL POSITIONS OR WHAT 
CANDIDATES THEY PORTED? 
>> NO.  
WHY WAS PALMER LUCKY FIRED? 
>> THAT IS A SPECIFIC PERSONNEL 
MATTER THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE. 
>> YOU MADE A SPECIFIC 
REPRESENT SAYS THAT YOU DID NOD 
MAKE IT ON POLITICAL VIEWS. 
>> IT WAS NOT BECAUSE AFTER 
POLITICAL VIEW. 
>> OF THOSE 15 TO 20,000 PEOPLE 
ENGAGED IN CONTENT REVIEW HOW 
MANY HAVE SUPPORTED FINANCIALLY 
A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR 
OFFICE? 
>> SENATOR,  I DO NOT KNOW 
THAT. 
>> YOUR TESTIMONY IS THAT IT IS 
NOT ENOUGH TO CONNECT PEOPLE 
BUT MAKE SURE THE CONNECTIONS 
ARE POSITIVE AND MAKE SURE THAT 
PEOPLE ARE NOT USING THEIR 
VOICE TO HURT PEOPLE OR SPREAD 
MISINFORMATION.  
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBLE TO NOT 
ONLY BILL TOOLS BUT TO MAKE 
SURE THE TOOLS ARE USED FOR 
GOOD. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG DO YOU FEEL YOUR 
RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSESS USERS 
WHETHER THEY ARE GOOD AND 
POSITIVE CONNECTIONINGS WERE 
ONES THAT THOSE 15 TO 20,000 
PEOPLE DEEMED UNACCEPTABLE OR 
DEPLORABLE? 
>> SENATOR, ARE YOU ASKING 
ABOUT ME PERSONALLY? 
>> FACEBOOK. 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THERE 
ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE 
WOULD ALL AGREE ARE THAT. 
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN OUR 
ELECTION, TERRORISM AND SELF 
HARM. 
>> THOSE ARE NOT SENSORSSHIP. 
>> I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD MOVE 
TERRORIST PROPAGANDA FROM THE 
SERVICE.  
THAT IS BAD ACTIVITY THAT WE 
WANT TO GET DOWN AND WE ARE 
PROUD WITH HOW WE DO THAT. 
WHAT I CAN SAY AND I WANT TO 
GET THIS IN BEFORE THE END 
HERE.  
I AM VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING 
SURE THAT FACEBOOK IS A 
PLATFORM FOR ALL IDEAS.  
THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT 
FOUNDING PRINCIPLE OF WHAT WE 
DO.  
WE ARE PROUD OF THE DISCOURSE 
AND THE DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT 
PEOPLE CAN SHARE ON THE SERVICE 
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AS 
LONG AS I AM RUNNING THE 
COMPANY I AM SURE THAT IS THE 
CASE. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR CRUZ. 
>> DO YOU WANT A BREAK NOW?  
OR DO YOU WANT TO KEEP GOING. 
>> SURE.  
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. 
>> ALL RIGHT.  
WE HAVE SENATOR WHITEHOUSE IS 
UP NEXT.  
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A FIVE 
MINUTE BREAK RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE 
NOW BEEN GOING A GOOD TWO 
HOURS. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> WE WILL RECESS FOR FIVE 
MINUTES AND RECONVENE.  
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG 
TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF A 
CONGRESSIONAL PANEL AND FACING 
A SLEW OF QUESTIONS AND SOME 
MORE DIFFICULT THAN OTHERS AND 
WE WILL BRING IN OUR PANEL, DAN 
PATTERSON AND JENNIFER GRIGEL 
FROM SYRACUSE SCHOOL AND ROGER 
CHECK THE EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF C 
NET NEW.  
BEFORE WE BEGIN I WANT TO POINT 
OUT THAT WALL STREET CLEARLY 
LIKES WHATEVER MARK ZUCKERBERG 
HAD TO SAY.  
THE STOCK IS -- I HAVE HEAR 
FACEBOOK SHARED WITH THE 
BIGGEST GAIN SINCE APRIL 28th 
AND TWITTER HIT A HIGH OF 
13.18, HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE 
MARCH 27th.  
DO WE THINK THAT SENATORS LIKED 
IT AS MUCH AS WALL STREET, DAN. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
>> I THINK THERE WAS DIVERSE 
SPECTRUM OF REACTIONS FROM 
SENATORS AND CLEARLY SOME OF 
THEM WERE WELL TRAINED AND 
PREPARED TO ASK TECHNICAL 
QUESTIONS AND OTHER SENATORS 
WERE GETTING IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION OR POINTING IN THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION BUT MAYBE 
DIDN'T HAVE THE TEXT 
SOPHISTICATION TO ASK THE 
QUESTIONS.  
I THINK IT WILL BE A TOUGH 
COUPLE OF DAYS FOR MR. 
ZUCKERBERG. 
>> I FELT THAT THE SENATORS 
WERE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS 
BUT MARK ZUCKERBERG WAS ABLE TO 
DIVERT THEM.  
ABOUT THE QUESTION ABOUT DEVICE 
SHARING.  
THAT WAS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION. 
>> THAT COULD HAVE TOUCHED UPON 
AN INTEREST QUESTION ABOUT 
WHETHER FACEBOOK TRACKS 
MULTIPLE DEVICES WHETHER THE 
FACEBOOK APP WAS THERE, HE 
PIVOTED AWAY FROM THAT AND 
TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER APPS IN 
THE PHONE AND SAYS FACEBOOK 
DOES NOT TAKE DATA FROM OTHER 
APPS THAT IS A CLEAR NO-NO AND 
PRETTY OBVIOUS GIVE ME FOR HIM. 
>> DAN, YOU MENTIONED THERE IS 
SOMETHING OUT THERE CALLED 
SILVER PUSH. 
>> CORRECT. 
>> AND EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS AND 
WHY IT IS POSSIBLE FACEBOOK 
USES IT. 
>> THERE IS A LEGITIMATE 
ADVERTISING COMPANY CALLED 
SILVER PUSH AND WHAT THAT DOES 
IN THEIR LANGUAGE CONNECT YOUR 
DEVICES AND SO THEY WILL LISTEN 
TO YOUR TELEVISION AND YOUR 
PHONE AND PARTICULARLY ON 
ANDROID IF YOU HAVE GIVEN APPS 
THAT USE SILVER PUSH 
PERMISSION. 
THE QUESTION DOES FACEBOOK 
LISTEN TO MY PHONE HAS BEEN A 
LARGE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION.  
IT IS OFTEN DISMISSED AS A 
CONSPIRACY THEORY AND WHAT WE 
DO NO KNOW THAT AUDIO 
TECHNOLOGY THAT VIEWERS CAN GO 
THERE RIGHT NOW AND LOOK AT HOW 
THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS AND FAIR 
TO ASSUME THAT FACEBOOK ON THE 
BLEEDING EDGE OF ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE USES SIMILAR 
TECHNOLOGIES. 
>> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT A 
SIMILAR QUESTION THAT SENATOR 
CANTWELL PUT TO MR. ZUCKERBERG 
AND CAUGHT HIM OFF GUARD AND 
ASKED ABOUT MR. PETER TAIL AND 
WHAT HE ASKED ABOUT. 
>> IT IS A SOCIAL MEDIA 
COMPANY. 
THEY WORK WITH POLICE 
DEPARTMENTINGS AND PETER TAIL 
IS ON THE BOARD OF FACEBOOK AND 
MARK ZUCKERBERG WAS SHOCKED. 
WIDELY REPORTED THAT SOMEONE 
FROM PALLENTAIL HAD GONE ON 
HELPED OUT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
IN THE DESIGN OF THEIR HELP.  
IT WAS SURPRISING THAT HE JUST 
KIND OF PUNTED THAT. 
>> HE DID. 
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TIMES 
THAT THE SENATORS GAVE HIM A 
PASS AND SAID WHY SHOULDN'T 
THERE BE REGULATION AND HE SAID 
I AM OKAY WITH THAT. 
>> I WELCOME IT IF IT IS A 
RIGHT REGULATION.  
THAT IS A LOADED TERM.  
BASICALLY REGULATION ON 
FACEBOOK'S TERMS.  
AND JEN, THEY PROBABLY ALREADY 
HAVE LOBBYISTS RUNNING THE 
REGULATIONS THEY WANT TO 
PRESENT TO CONGRESS. 
>> AT LEAST ONE SENATOR ASKED 
WILL YOU PLEASE SUBMIT THE 
REGULATIONS THAT YOU THINK WE 
SHOULD IMPLEMENT. 
>> IT GOES TO SHOW YOU THERE IS 
A LACK OF TECHNICAL SAVVY WITH 
SOME OF THESE SENATORS, THEY 
ARE NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW TO 
REGULATE THESE COMPANIES. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> AND IT SHOWS YOU HOW 
POWERFUL FACEBOOK IS BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THE 
COMPANY IN REGULATION.  
IF THERE'S COMMON GROUND WHERE 
THEY AGREE ON IT START THERE SO 
THEY WHAT ABOUT THAT 
INFORMATION FROM MARK 
ZUCKERBERG. 
>> AND HE WAS ASK ABOUT THE 
EUROPEAN REGULATIONS SHOULD BE 
APPLIED TO THE U.S. AND HE SAYS 
IT IS WORTH A CONVERSATION. 
>> WELL, IT IS CERTAINLY WORTH 
A CONVERSATION FOR HIS PEERS AT 
OTHER BIG DATA FIRMS.  
IN FACT WHILE WE WERE WATCHING 
THERE, I RECEIVED A MESSAGE 
FROM A SOURCE THAT WORKS AT 
ANOTHER LARGE DATA COMPANY AND 
HE SAYS HONESTLY, THE GDPR, THE 
GENERAL DATA PRIVACY REGULATION 
THAT GOES INTO EFFECT IN MAY, 
ON MAY 25th WILL FIRST OF ALL 
IT WILL AFFECT EVERY COMPANY 
BECAUSE THE DATA IN THE CLOUD 
IS NOT IN ONE LOCATION, IT IS 
IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS SO BY 
DEFAULT THEY HAVE TO PROTECT 
YOUR DATA ACCORDING TO THE 
REGULATIONS. 
THE GDPR OR AN AMERICAN VERSION 
OF THE GDPR COULD HAVE 
SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR 
ALMOST EVERY CLOUD AND 
ALGORITHMLY BASED COMPANY 
BECAUSE IT WOULD CLAMP DOWN ON 
THE COMPONENTS AND HOW THEY 
OPERATE. 
>> AND WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 
REGULATION, HE SAYS REMEMBER WE 
DON'T WANT TO CLAMP DOWN ON 
INNOVATION AND BROUGHT UP THE 
TECHNOLOGY AROUND FACE 
RECOGNITION AND THERE ARE MANY 
WAYS THAT COULD GO WRONG AND HE 
SAID OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA 
ARE FULL STEAM AHEAD AND LET'S 
NOT CLAMP IT DOWN HERE WHICH IS 
WHAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 
HAPPY TO HERE.  
HE SUPPORTS THE HONEST ADS APP 
THAT AT THIS POINT WILL 
PROBABLY GO INTO -- 
>> IT IS SO DEEPLY TIED TO 
RUSSIA AT THIS POINT.  
THAT IS AGAIN EASY TERRITORY 
FOR HIM TO AGREE.  
HE IS FOCUSING THE REGULATORS 
ON THINGS THAT HE KNOWS HE 
NEEDS TO FIX.  
THIS IS STRATEGIC. 
>> DAN PATTERSON AND JENNIFER 
GRIGLE AND ROGER CHANGE.  
THANK YOU SO MUCH.  
LAWMAKERS ARE WARNING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ABOUT FIRING SPECIAL 
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER AFTER 
THE PRESIDENT ATTACKED THE 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AS A WITCH-
HUNT BUT TODAY AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, SARAH HUCK ABY SANDERS 
WAS PRESSED ON WHETHER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD THE 
AUTHORITY AND SHE SAYS HE DOES. 
>> DOES HE HAVE THE POWER TO 
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER. 
>> I BELIEVE SO. 
>> YOU SAY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
THE POWER TO DO THAT BECAUSE 
MOST EXPERTS THINK HE WOULD 
HAVE TO HIRE ROB LOWEN STINE 
AND COULD REFUSE. 
>> I KNOW A NUMBER OF 
INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGAL 
COMMUNITY AND INCLUDING THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT HE 
HAS THE POWER TO DO SO BUT I 
DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER 
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THAT. 
>> IT IS -- I HAVE ASKED, THEY 
SAID LOWEN STEEN, ONLY HE HAS 
THE POWER TO FIND THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL. 
>> AGAIN, WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED 
THAT THE PRESIDENT CERTAINLY 
HAS THE POWER TO MAKE THAT 
DECISION. 
I CAN'T GO ANYTHING BEYOND 
THAT. 
>> AFTER THE BRIEFING, JUSTICE 
REPORTER PAULA REED FILED THIS 
REPORT DETAILING THE WHITE 
HOUSE RESPONSE.  
THE BIGGEST HEAD LINE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE HAS THE 
UNILATERAL AUTHORITY TO FIRE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER. 
JUSTICE OFFICIALS HAVE SAID 
THAT ONLY ROB ROSENSTEIN 
OVERSEEING THE INVESTIGATION 
CAN FIRE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
AND THE ONE APPOINTED THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL.  
THIS IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT 
DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE WE SAW 
YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT'S ANGER 
ENTERED A NEW PHASE IN TERMS OF 
HIS FRUSTRATION IN TERMS OF HIS 
OWN DEPARTMENT. 
THERE'S TWO INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
THE PRESIDENT'S CIRCLE AND 
YESTERDAY THEY WERE APPROVED AT 
THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 
THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT WHAT 
HAPPENED IS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVES HE ALONE CAN FIRE THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
>>> THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ASKED 
ABOUT THE F.B.I. 
RAID OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
ATTORNEY.  
SARAH HUCK ABY DOES NOT KNOW 
WHETHER HE REPRESENTS THE 
PRESIDENT AND WHETHER THEY HAD 
SPOKEN SINCE THE RAID.  
RUSSIA HAD VETOED AN 
INVESTIGATION OVER AN ALLEGE 
CHEMICAL ATTACK. 
>>> RUSSIA CLAIM THE RESOLUTION 
WOULD CREATE A BIAS 
INVESTIGATIVE FORCE.  
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE IS 
CONSIDERING MILITARY OPTIONS IN 
LIGHT OF THE ATTACK.  
THOUGH RUSSIA HAS WARNED OF 
GRAVE REPERCUSSIONS IF THE U.S. 
INTERVENES. 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MUCH 
MORE NEWS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THIS BREAK.  
STICK WITH US.  
YOU ARE  STREAMING CBSN ALWAYS 
ON. 
>>> IF YOU OR IN ANY AT 
FACEBOOK BEEN INTERVIEWED BY 
THE SPECIAL OFFICE? 
>> YES. 
>> HAVE YOU? 
>> I HAVE NOT. 
>> I HAVE NOT. 
>> OTHERS HAVE? 
>> I BELIEVE SO.  
AND I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE 
BECAUSE THAT -- OUR WORK WITH 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS 
CONFIDENTIAL AND I WANT TO MAKE 
SURE THAT IN AN OPEN SESSION I 
AM NOT REVEALING SOMETHING THIS 
IS A CONFIDENTIAL. 
>> I UNDERSTAND. 
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
YOU HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND YOU 
HAVE HAD SUBPOENAS. 
>> ACTUALLY LET ME CLARIFY 
THAT. 
I AM NOT AWAY OF A SUBPOENA 
THERE MAY BE BUT I KNOW WE ARE 
WORKING WITH THEM. 
>> THAT WAS FACEBOOK CEO MARK 
ZUCKERBERG CAUGHT ABOUT THE 
MUELLER PROBE IN THE 
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING.  
LET'S BRING IN ED O'KEEFE FROM 
WASHINGTON.  
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?  
ZUCKERBERG WAS NOT EXPECTING 
THEM. 
>> ONE OF THE MOMENTS SO FAR 
WHEN IT COMES BEYOND GENERAL 
NEWS AND TECH POLICY WITH WHAT 
TECH FOLKS WOULD CARE ABOUT 
CONFIRMING THAT THE COMPANY HAS 
BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ROBERT 
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION AND 
SAYS HE HAS NOT BEEN 
INTERVIEWED AND THAT WOULD MAKE 
SENSE BECAUSE IT IS A COMPANY 
THAT EMPLOYS THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE.  
REGARDLESS IT SHOWS THAT 
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION COVERS 
THAT FAR AND THE OTHER NEWS IS 
THE FACT THAT HE HAS DECLINED 
SO FAR AT LEAST TO COMMIT TO 
ANY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION OR 
POTENTIAL POLICY CHANGES.  
HE WAS ASKED TWICE BY DIFFERENT 
SENATORS WHETHER THE EUROPEAN 
REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT 
IN PLACE AND DON'T ASK ME TO 
CHARACTERIZE WHAT THEY ARE BUT 
I KNOW THEY ARE PRETTY STRICT, 
WHETHER THAT MAKES SENSE IN 
THIS COUNTRY AND HE KIND OF 
FIRST SAID THAT MAY NOT WORK 
HERE AND THEN HE SAID IT MIGHT. 
POTENTIALLY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
COULD COME ABOUT. 
BUT I THINK HE HAS BEEN 
CONTRITE AND CONTRITE IN SOUND 
BYTE FRIENDLY WAYS.  
HE WAS COACHED ON WHAT HE 
SHOULD SAY AND HOW HE SHOULD 
SAY IT AND TALKS ABOUT HOW THEY 
ARE HIRING 20,000 MORE PEOPLE 
TO HELP POLICE THE SITE AND 
KEEPS HARKENING BACK TO HIS 
HUMBLE DAYS IN A HARVARD DORM 
ROOM AS IF THAT WOULD WIN HIM 
SYMPATHY AND THIS EXCHANGE WITH 
SENATORS HAVE EXPOSED MANY OF 
THEM AS ORRIN HATCH THE SECOND 
OLDEST SENATOR AND THE MOST 
SENIOR REPUBLICAN HAD NO IDEA 
THAT FACEBOOK SELLS AD IS A 
SIGN THAT SENATOR HATCH DOES 
NOT CHECK UP ON THE GRANDKIDS 
THAT WAY AND SENATOR ROGER 
WICKER FROM FACEBOOK HAD TO 
CLARIFY WHAT HE MEANT BY PIPES 
OR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS 
AND HOW THEY PIPE IN INTERNET 
TO YOUR HOME. 
EXAMPLES THAT AND REMINDERS 
FRANKLY THAT IN A BODY WHERE 
THE AVERAGE AGE IS 61, MANY OF 
THE PEOPLE QUESTIONING HIM 
TODAY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE 
PROCESS. 
>> YOU FELL AS IF THE SENATORS 
WERE ASKING QUESTIONS WRITTEN 
FOR THEM AND MR. ZUCKERBERG WAS 
ABLE TO DIVERT THEM. 
>> PRECISELY AND DEFINITELY 
DOING THAT, SOME OF THE MORE 
SENIOR MEMBERS AND SENIOR IN 
TENURE AND SENIOR IN AGE IN THE 
SENATE AND I THINK THEY WERE 
FLASHING THEIR CARDS CLEARLY. 
>>> ED O'KEEFE THANK YOU.  
WE WILL TAKE YOU BACK NOW TO 
CAPITOL HILL WHERE FACEBOOK CEO 
MARK ZUCKERBERG IS TESTIFYING 
BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE 
SENATE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE AND 
THE SENATE COMMITTEE. 
>> OUR INDIVIDUAL PRINCIPALS OF 
THE FIRM ALSO BEEN?  
P-A-L-S. 
>> WE ARE BLOCKING THEM FROM 
DOING BUSINESS BUT I DON'T 
BELIEVE WE ARE BLOCKING 
PEOPLE'S PERSONAL ACCOUNTS. 
>> CAN ANY CUSTOMER AMEND YOUR 
TERMS OF SERVICE OR IF THE 
TERMS OF SERVICE TAKE IT OR 
LEAVE IT PROPOSITION FOR THE 
AVERAGE CUSTOMER? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THE 
TERMS OF SERVICE ARE WHAT THEY 
ARE BUT THE SERVICE IS REALLY 
DEFINED BY PEOPLE.  
BECAUSE YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHAT 
INFORMATION YOU SHARE AND THE 
WHOLE SERVICE IS ABOUT WHICH 
FRIENDS YOU CONNECT TO. 
>> MY QUESTION WOULD RELATE TO 
SENATOR GRAHAM HELD UP THAT BIG 
FAT DOCUMENT IT IS EASY TO PUT 
A LOT OF THINGS BURIED IN A 
DOCUMENT THAT LATER TURN OUT TO 
BE OF CONSEQUENCE AND ALL I 
WANT TO DO IS ESTABLISH BUT 
THAT DOCUMENT THAT SENATOR 
GRAHAM HELD UP, THAT IS NOT A 
NEGOTIATE ABLE THING WITH 
INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS BUT FOR 
THEM TO USE THE SERVICE. 
>> IT IS ON THE TERMS OF 
SERVICE BUT WE OFFER A LOT OF 
CONTROLS SO PEOPLE CAN 
CONFIGURE THE EXPERIENCE OF HOW 
THEY WANT. 
>> SO LAST QUESTION ON A 
DIFFERENT SUBJECT HAVING TO DO 
WITH THE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS 
THAT YOU ARE UNDERTAKING FOR 
ENTITIES THAT ARE PUTTING UP 
POLITICAL CONTENT OR ISSUE AD 
CONTENT. 
YOU HAVE SAID THEY ALL HAVE TO 
GO THROUGH AN AUTHORIZATION  
PROCESS BEFORE THEY DO IT.  
YOU SAID YOU WILL VERIFY THE 
IDENTITY.  
HOW DO YOU LOOK BEHIND A SHELL 
CORPORATION AND FIND WHO  WHO 
IS BEHIND IT, YOUR 
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS.  
DO YOU NEED TO LOOK BEHIND 
SHELL CORPORATIONS TO FIND OUT 
WHO IS REALLY BEHIND THE 
CONTENT THAT IS BEING POSTED 
AND IF YOU MAY NEED TO LOOK 
BEHIND A SHELL CORPORATION, HOW 
WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT?  
HOW WILL YOU GET TO THE TRUE 
WHAT LAWYERS WOULD CALL 
BENEFICIAL OWNER OF THE SITE 
THAT IS PUTTING OUT THE 
POLITICALMATERIAL? 
>> SENATOR, ARE YOU REFERRING 
TO THE VERIFICATION OF 
POLITICAL ISSUE ADS? 
>> YES AND BEFORE THAT 
POLITICAL ADS, YES. 
>> WE WILL REQUIRE A VALID 
GOVERNMENT IDENTITY AND WE ARE 
GOING TO VERIFY THE LOCATION. 
SO WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT SO 
THAT WAY SOMEONE SITTING IN 
RUSSIA FOR EXAMPLE, COULD NOT 
SAY THAT THEY ARE IN AMERICA 
AND, THEREFORE, ABLE TO RUN AN 
ELECTION AD. 
>> BUT RUNNING THROUGH A 
CORPORATION DOMICILED IN 
DELAWARE, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF 
THEY WERE A RUSSIAN OWNER. 
>> SENATOR, THAT IS CORRECT. 
>> THANK YOU.  
MY TIME IS EXPIRED AND I 
APPRECIATE THE COURTESY FOR THE 
EXTRA SECONDS. 
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 
>> THANK, MR. CHAIRMAN.  
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A 
STATEMENT YOU MADE SHORTLY 
BEFORE THE BREAK A FEW MINUTES 
AGO.  
YOU SAID THAT THERE IS SOME 
CATEGORIES OF SPEECH.  
SOME TYPES OF CONTENT THAT 
FACEBOOK WOULD NEVER WANT TO 
HAVE ANY PART OF AND IT TAKES 
ACTIVE STEPS TO AVOID 
DISSEMINATING HATE SPEECH AND 
NUDITY AND RACIST SPEECH AND I 
ASSUME YOU ALSO MEANT TERRORIST 
ACTS, THREATS OF PHYSICA 
VIOLENCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT. 
BEYOND THAT, WOULD YOU AGREE 
THAT FACEBOOK OUGHT NOT TO BE 
PUTTING ITS THUMB ON THE SCALE 
WITH REGARD TO THE CONTENT OF 
SPEECH ASSUMING IT FITS OUT OF 
ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES THAT IS 
PROHIBITED? 
>> SENATOR, YES.  
THERE ARE GENERALLY TWO 
CATEGORIES OF CONTENT THAT WE 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT, ONE ARE 
THINGS THAT COULD CAUSE REAL 
WORLD HARM.  
SO TERRORISM CERTAINLY FITS 
TOWNSHIP THAT.  
SELF HARM FITS INTO THAT.  
I WOULD CONSIDER ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE AND THOSE ARE THE 
TYPES OF THINGS THAT -- I DON'T 
CONSIDER THERE TO BE MUCH 
DISCUSSION ON WHETHER THEY ARE 
GOOD OR BAD TOPICS. 
>> AND I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT. 
WHAT I'M ASKING IS ONCE YOU GET 
BEYOND THOSE CATEGORIES OF 
THINGS THAT ARE PROHIBITED AND 
SHOULD BE, IS IT FACEBOOK'S 
POSITION THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE 
PUTTING ITS THUMB ON THE SCALE 
AND IT SHOULD NOT BE FAVORING 
OR DISFAVORING SPEECH BASED ON 
ITS CONTENT AND BASED ON THE 
VIEWPOINT OF THAT SPEECH? 
>> SENATOR, IN GENERAL, THAT IS 
OUR POSITION.  
WHAT WE -- ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT IS IMPORTANT THOUGH THAT 
IN ORDER TO CREATE A SERVICE 
WHERE EVERYONE HAS A VOICE, WE 
ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
PEOPLE ARE NOT BULLIED OR 
BASICALLY INTIMIDATED OR THE 
ENVIRONMENT FEELS UNSAFE FOR 
THEM. 
>> OK.  
SO WHEN YOU SAY IN EVERYWHERE, 
THAT'S THE EXCEPTION THAT YOU 
ARE REFERRING TO, THE EXCEPTION 
BEING THAT IF SOMEONE FEELS 
BULLIED EVEN IF IT IS NOT 
NUDITY OR RACIST SPEECH OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU MAY 
STEP IN THERE.  
BEYOND THAT WOULD YOU PUT YOUR 
THUMB ON THE SCALE AS FAR AS 
THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CONTENT 
BEING POSTED? 
>> SENATOR, NO.  
IN GENERAL, OUR GOAL IS TO 
ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE AS MUCH 
EXPRESSION AS POSSIBLE. 
>> OKAY.  
SO SUBJECT TO THE EXCEPTIONS 
THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED, YOU 
WOULD STAY OUT OF THAT.  
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, ISN'T 
THERE A SIGNIFICANT FREE MARKET 
INCENTIVE THAT A SOCIAL MEDIA 
COMPANY INCLUDING YOURS HAS IN 
ORDER TO SAVE GUARD THE DATA OF 
YOUR USERS?  
DON'T YOU HAVE FREE MARKET 
INCENTIVES? 
>> YES. 
>> DON'T THEY ALIGN WITH THOSE 
OF US HERE THAT WANTS TO SEE 
DATA SAFEGUARDED. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> DO YOU HAVE THE 
TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS AVAILABLE 
AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO MAKE SURE 
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND TO 
PROTECT, SAY, AND APP DEVELOPER 
FROM TRANSFERRING FACEBOOK DATA 
TO A 3rd PARTY? 
>> SENATOR A LOT OF THAT WE DO 
AND A LOT OF IT WILL HAPPEN 
OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEMS AND 
REQUIRES NEW MEASURES.  
FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE CHOSE TO 
SHARE INFORMATION WITH AN APP 
DEVELOPER THAT WORKED ACCORDING 
TO THE SYSTEM DESIGN AND IT WAS 
TRANSFERRED OUT OF OUR SYSTEM 
TO SERVERS THAT THIS DEVELOPER 
ALEXANDER COLDGAN HAD AND THAT 
PERSON CHOSE TOSELL THE DATA 
TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA.  
THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE MUCH 
MORE ACTIVE INTERVENTION AND 
AUDITING TO PREVENT GOING 
FORWARD BECAUSE ONCE IT IS OUT 
OF OUR SYSTEM IT IS A LOT 
HARDER FOR US TO HAVE A FULL 
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS 
HAPPENING. 
>> 
>> FROM WHAT YOU HAVE SAID 
TODAY AND FROM PREVIOUS 
STATEMENTS MADE BY YOU AND 
OTHER OFFICIALS AT YOUR 
COMPANY, DATA IS AT THE CENTER 
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL, IT IS HOW 
YOU MAKE MONEY AND YOUR ABILITY 
TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS 
EFFECTIVELY EVEN THOUGH YOU 
DON'T CHARGE YOUR USERS IS 
BASED ON MONEYIZING DATA.  
THE REAL ISIS WHAT YOU TELL THE 
PUBLIC AND WHAT YOU TELL USERS 
ON FACEBOOK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE 
GOING TO DO WITH THE DATA, 
ABOUT HOW YOU ARE GOING TO USE 
IT. 
CAN YOU GIVE ME A COUPLE OF 
EXAMPLES, MAYBE TWO EXAMPLES OF 
WAYS IN WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED 
BY FACEBOOK IN A WAY THAT 
PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF? 
TWO EXAMPLES OF TYPES OF DATA 
THAT FACEBOOK COLLECTS THAT 
MIGHT BE SURPRISING TO FACEBOOK 
USERS? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, I WILL HOPE 
THAT WHAT WE DO WITH DATA IS 
NOT SURPRISING TO PEOPLE. 
>> AND HAS IT BEEN AT TIMES? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK IN 
THIS CASE PEOPLE CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T EXPECT THIS DEVELOPER TO 
SELL THE DATA TO CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA.  
IN GENERAL THERE ARE TWO TYPES 
OF DATA THAT FACEBOOK HAS, THE 
VAST MAJORITY AND THE FIRST 
CATEGORY IS CONTENT THAT PEOPLE 
CHOSE TO SHARE ON THE SERVICE 
THEMSELVES.  
SO THAT IS ALL OF THE PHOTOS 
THAT YOU SHARE, THE POSTS THAT 
YOU MAKE, WHAT YOU THINK OF AS 
THE FACEBOOK SERVICE.  
THAT IS -- EVERYONE HAS CONTROL 
EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT THEY GO 
TO SHARE THAT AND THEY COULD 
DELETE IT ANYTIME THEY WANT, 
FULL CONTROL THE MAJORITY OF 
THE DATA.  
THE SECOND CATEGORY IS AROUND 
SPECIFIC DATA THAT WE COLLECT 
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE 
ADVERTISING EXPERIENCES BETTER 
AND MORRELL VAN AND WORK FOR 
BUSINESSES AND THOSE OFTEN 
REVOLVE AROUND MEASURING IF WE 
SHOWED YOU AN AD THEN YOU CLICK 
THROUGH AND YOU GO SOMEWHERE 
ELSE WE CAN MEASURE THAT YOU 
ACTUALLY, THAT THE AD WORKS AND 
THAT MAKES IT RELEVANT FOR THE 
PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE ADS AND 
THE BUSINESSES BECAUSE THEY 
PERFORM BETTER AND YOU HAVE 
CONTROL OF THE SECOND DATA.  
YOU CAN TURN OFF THE ABILITY 
FOR FACEBOOK TO COLLECT THAT.  
ADS WILL GET WORSE SO PEOPLE 
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. 
>> SENATOR. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, I 
WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE TERMS 
OF SERVICE.  
THEY ARE ABOUT 3200 WORDS WITH 
32 LINKS AND ONE OF THE LINKS 
IS TO THE DATA POLICY AND 
PEOPLE HAVE NO EARTHLY IDEA 
WHAT THEY ARE SIGNING UP FOR 
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE 
PRESENT TIME THIS IS A LEGALLY 
BINDING BUT I AM WANDERING IF 
YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THE BILLIONS 
OF USERS IN PLAIN LANGUAGE, 
WHAT ARE THEY SIGNING UP FOR? 
>> SENATOR, THAT IS A GOOD AND 
IMPORTANT QUESTION HERE.  
IN GENERAL, YOU SIGN UP FOR THE 
FACEBOOK.  
YOU GET THE ABILITY TO SHARE 
THE INFORMATION YOU WANT WITH 
PEOPLE.  
THAT'S WHAT THE SERVICE IS, 
THAT YOU CAN CONNECT WITH THE 
PEOPLE THAT YOU WANT AND YOU 
CAN SHARE WHATEVER CONTENT 
MATTERS TO YOU.  
PHOTOS OR LINKS OR POSTS AND 
YOU CAN GET CONTROL OVER WHO 
YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH AND YOU 
CAN TAKE IT DOWN IF YOU DON'T 
WANT. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE PART THAT 
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT, NOT 
THE FUN PART. 
>> WHAT IS THAT? 
>> THE PART THAT PEOPLE ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT THAT THE DATA 
WILL BE IMPROPERLY USED SO 
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE 
OUT, ARE YOUR DMS INFORMING THE 
ADS.  
ARE YOUR BROWSING HABITS BEING 
COLLECTED? 
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT WHEN 
YOU CLICK LIKE ON SOMETHING OR 
IF YOU SAY YOU LIKE A CERTAIN 
MOVIE OR HAVE A PARTICULAR 
POLITICAL PROCLIVITY THAT I 
THINK THAT IS FAIR GAME, 
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT. 
WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND 
EXACTLY BECAUSE BOTH AS A 
MATTER OF PRACTICE AND NOT 
BEING ABLE TO DECIPHER THOSE 
TERMS OF SERVICE AND THE 
PRIVACY POLICY IS WHAT EXACTLY 
ARE YOU DOING WITH THE DATA AND 
DO YOU DRAW A DISTINCTION 
BETWEEN DATA COLLECTED IN THE 
PROCESS OF UTILIZING THE 
PLATFORM AND THAT WHICH WE 
CLEARLY VOLUNTEER TO THE PUBLIC 
TO PRESENT OURSELVES TO OTHER 
FACEBOOK USERS? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT SURE I 
FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS.  
IN GENERAL PEOPLE COME TO 
FACEBOOK TO SHARE CONTEND WITH 
OTHER PEOPLE.  
WE USE THAT IN ORDER TO ALSO IN 
FORM HOW WE RANK SERVICES LIKE 
NEWS FEED AND ADS. 
>> LET ME TRY A COUPLE OF 
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES.  
IF I AM EMAILING WITHIN AN APP, 
DOES THAT INFORM YOUR 
ADVERTISERS? 
>> NO.  
WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THE CONTENT 
IN WHAT'S APP.  
IT IS FULLY ENCRYPTED. 
>> IS THERE AN ALGORITHM THAT 
SPITS OUT SOMETHING TO YOUR AD 
PLATFORM AND I AM EMAILING 
ABOUT BLACK PANTHER IN WHAT APP 
DO I GET A BLACK PANTHER BANNER 
APP. 
>> FACEBOOK DOES NOT SEE WHAT 
IS TRANSMITTED OVER WHAT APP. 
>> BUT DO THEY TALK TO EACH 
OTHER WITHOUT THE HUMAN BEINGS 
TALKING TO EACH OTHER? 
>> THE QUESTION IS IF YOU 
MESSAGE ABOUT BLACK PANTHER AND 
WHAT APP IT WOULD NOT FORM 
ANIARDS. 
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE 
QUESTION OF DATA AND AS A 
MATTER OF PRINCIPLE YOU ARE 
SAYING WE WANT OUR CUSTOMERS TO 
HAVE MORE RATHER THAN LESS 
CONTROL OVER THE DATA.  
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE IT IS TRUE 
AS A LEGAL MATTER THAT I OWN MY 
FACEBOOK DATA BECAUSE YOU ARE 
THE WON MONITORING IT.  
DO YOU WANT TO MODIFY THAT TO 
EXPRESS THAT AS A STATEMENT OF 
PRINCIPLE AND ASPIRATIONAL GOAL 
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT 
WE OWN OUR OWN DATA, OTHERWISE 
WE WOULD BE GETTING A CUT. 
>> WELL, SENATOR, YOU OWN IT IN 
THE SENSE THAT YOU CHOOSE TO 
PUT IT THERE.  
YOU CAN TAKE IT DOWN AT ANY 
TIME AND YOU COMPLETELY CONTROL 
THE TERMS UNDER WHICH IT IS 
USED.  
ON FACEBOOK YOU ARE GRANTING US 
A LICENSE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW IT 
TO OTHER PEOPLE. 
THAT'S NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR 
THE SERVICE TO OPERATE. 
>> SO YOUR DEFINITION OF 
OWNERSHIP IS THAT I SIGN UP AND 
I VOLUNTARILY AND I MAY DELETE 
MY ACCOUNT IF I WISH BUT THAT'S 
BASICALLY IT. 
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK THAT 
THE CONTROL IS MUCH MORE 
GRANULAR THAN THAT, YOU CAN 
CHOOSE EACH PHOTO YOU WANT TO 
PUT UP OR EACH MESSAGE AND YOU 
CAN DELETE THOSE AND YOU DON'T 
NEED TO DELETE THE WHOLE 
ACCOUNT.  
YOU HAVE CONTROL AND YOU CAN 
SHARE POSTS WITH DIFFERENT 
PEOPLE. 
>> I WANT TO PROPOSE SOMETHING 
FOR YOU AND TAKE IT FOR THE 
RECORD.  
I READ AN ARTICLE BY PROFESSOR 
JACK BALCAN AT YALE THAT 
PROPOSES A CONCEPT OF 
INFORMATION FIDUCIARY THAT IS 
RESPONSIBLE IN THE ECONOMIC 
ACCEPTS BUT THIS IS A 
RELATIONSHIP LIKE DOCTORS AND 
LAWYERS, TECH COMPANIES SHOULD 
HOL IN TRUST OUR PERSONAL DATA. 
ARE YOU OPEN TO THE IDEA OF 
INFORMATION FIDUCIARY. 
>>I THINK IT IS AN INTERESTING 
IDEA AND JACK IS THOUGHTFUL IN 
THE SPACE SO I DO THINK IT 
DESERVES CONSIDERATION. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG 
FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND MR. 
CHAIRMAN.  
THE FULL SCOPE OF FACEBOOK 
USERS ACTIVITY CAN PRINT VERY 
PERSONAL PICTURE I THINK AND 
ADDITIONALLY YOU HAVE THOSE TWO 
BILLION USERS THAT ARE OUT 
THERE EVERY MONTH AND SO WE ALL 
KNOW THAT IS LARGER THAN THE 
POPULATION OF MOST COUNTRIES SO 
HOW MANY DATA CATEGORIES DO YOU 
STORE, DOES FACEBOOK STORE ON 
THE CATEGORIES THAT YOU 
COLLECT? 
>> SENATOR, CAN YOU CLARIFY 
WHAT YOU MEAN BY DATA 
CATEGORIES? 
>> THERE IS SOME PAST REPORTS 
THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT 
INDICATE THAT FACEBOOK COLLECTS 
ABOUT 96 DATA CATEGORIES FOR 
THOSE TWO BILLION ACTIVE USERS. 
THAT'S 192 BILLION DATA POINTS 
THAT ARE BEING GENERATED, I 
THINK AT ANY TIME FROM 
CONSUMERS GLOBALLY. 
SO HOW MANY DO YOU -- DOES 
FACEBOOK STORE OUT OF THAT?  
DO YOU STORE ANY? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT ACTUALLY 
SURE WHAT THAT IS REFERRING TO. 
>> ON THE POINTS THAT YOU 
COLLECT INFORMATION, IF WE CALL 
THOSE CATEGORIES.  
HOW MANY DO YOU STORE OF 
INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE 
COLLECTING? 
>> SENATOR, THE WAY THAT I 
THINK ABOUT THIS, IS THAT THERE 
ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES.  
THIS DOESN'T LINE UP WITH WHAT 
THE SPECIFIC REPORT THAT YOU 
WERE SAYING, I CAN MAKE SURE 
THAT WE FOLLOW UP WITH YOU 
AFTERWARDS TO GET YOU THE 
INFORMATION YOU NEED.  
THE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES THAT I 
THINK ABOUT ARE CONTENT THAT A 
PERSON HAS CHOSEN TO SHARE AND 
THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER IT, AND 
WHEN THEY PUT IT ON AND TAKE IT 
DOWN AND WHO SEES IT AND THE 
OTHER CATEGORY ARE DATA THAT 
ARE CONNECTED TO MAKING THE ADS 
RELEVANT.  
YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER 
BOTH AND YOU CAN TURN OFF THE 
DATA RELATED TO ADS AND CHOOSE 
NOT TO SHARE ANY CONTENT OR 
CONTROL EXACTLY WHO SEES IT OR 
TAKES DOWN THE CONTENT IN THE 
FORMER CATEGORY. 
>> DOES FACEBOOK STORE ANY OF 
THAT IF. 
>> YES. 
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU STORE OF 
THAT, EVERYTHING?  
IS THAT IN STORAGE SOMEWHERE? 
>> SENATOR, WE STORE DATA ABOUT 
WHAT PEOPLE SHARE ON THE 
SERVICE AND INFORMATION THAT IS 
REQUIRED TO DO RANKING BETTER 
AND SHOW YOU WHAT YOU CARE 
ABOUT IN NEWS FEED. 
>> DO YOU STORE TEXT, HISTORY, 
MUSIC CONTENT, ACTIVITY, DEVICE 
LOCATION? 
>> SENATOR, SOME OF THAT 
CONTENT WITH PEOPLE'S 
PERMISSION WE DO STORE. 
>> DO YOU DISCLOSE ANY OF THAT? 
>> YES.  
IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE 
THAT INFORMATION WITH FACEBOOK, 
I BELIEVE THAT ALMOST 
EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST SAID 
WOULD BE ... 
>> IN THE PRIVACY SETTINGS IT 
IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY 
LIM THE SHARING WITH OTHER 
FACEBOOK USERS, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>> YES, EVERY PERSON GETS TO 
CONTROL WHO GETS TO SEE THEIR 
CONTENT. 
>> AND DOES THAT LIMIT THE 
ABILITY FOR FACEBOOK TO COLLECT 
AND USE IT? 
>> SENATOR, YES, THERE ARE 
OTHER CONTROLS THAT DETERMINE 
WHAT FACEBOOK CAN DO AS WELL. 
SO FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE HAVE 
CONTROL ABOUT FACE RECOGNITION. 
IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT US TO HELP 
IDENTIFY WHEN THEY ARE IN 
PHOTOS THAT THEIR FRIENDS 
UPLOAD, THEY CAN TURN THAT OFF 
AND WE WON'T STORE THAT KIND OF 
TEMPLATE FOR THEM. 
>> AND THERE WAS SOME ACTION 
WROTE A FACEBOOK POST AT THE -
TIME ON A PUBLIC PAGE ON THE 
INTERNET THAT IT USED TO SEEM 
SCARY TO PEOPLE BUT AS LONG AS 
THEY COULD MAKE THEIR PAGE 
PRIVATE, THEY FELT SAFE SHARING 
WITH THEIR FRIENDS ON LINE. 
CONTROL WAS KEY.  
AND YOU JUST MENTIONED CONTROL. 
SENATOR HATCH ASKED YOU A 
QUESTION AND YOU RESPONDED 
THERE ABOUT COMPLETE CONTROL.  
SO YOU AND YOUR COMPANY HAVE 
USED THAT TERM REPEATEDLY AND I 
BELIEVE THAT YOU USE IT TO 
REASSURE USERS, IS THAT 
CORRECT?  
THAT YOU DO HAVE CONTROL AND 
COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE 
INFORMATION? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, THIS IS HOW 
THE SERVICE WORKS.  
THE CORE THING THAT FACEBOOK IS 
AND ALL OF OUR SERVICES, WHAT'S 
UP, INSTAGRAM AND MESSENGER. 
>> THIS IS A QUESTION OF 
FACEBOOK IS ABOUT FEELING SAFE 
OR ARE USERS ACTUALLY SAFE?  
IS FACEBOOK BEING SAFE? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK FACEBOOK IS 
SAFE.  
I USE IT AND MY FAMILY USE IT 
AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE I LOVE 
AND CARE ABOUT IT USE IT ALL 
THE TIME.  
THESE CONTROLS ARE NOT JUST TO 
MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE IT IS 
WHAT PEOPLE WANT IN THE 
PRODUCT.  
THE REALITY IS -- JUST THINK 
ABOUT HOW YOU USE IT YOURSELF, 
YOU TAKE A PHOTO, YOU ARE NOT 
ALWAYS GOING TO SEND THAT TO 
THE SAME PEOPLE.  
YOU MAY WANT TO TEXT IT TO ONE 
PERSON OR TO A GROUP THAT YOU 
HAVE A PAGE.  
YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO PUT 
SOME STUFF OUT THERE PUBLICLY 
TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR 
CONSTITUENTS.  
THERE ARE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF 
PEOPLE THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO 
CONNECT WITH AND THOSE CONTROLS 
ARE IMPORTANT AND IN PRACTICE 
OF OPERATION OF THE SERVICE NOT 
TO JUST BUILD TRUST BY 
PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH CONTROL 
DOES THAT BUT ACTUALLY IN ORDER 
TO MAKE IT SO PEOPLE CAN 
FULFILL THEIR GOALS WITH THE 
SERVICE. 
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN AND MR. 
ZUCKERBERG FOR JOINING US.  
I THINK THE WHOLE REASON IS 
BECAUSE OF A TENSION BETWEEN 
TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES.  
YOU HAVE SAID ABOUT THE DATA 
THAT PEOPLE POST ON FACEBOOK 
YOU CONTROL AND OWN THE DATA 
THAT YOU PUT ON FACEBOOK.  
YOU HAVE SAID SOME VERY 
POSITIVE OPTIMISTIC THINGS 
ABOUT FACEBOOK BUT IT IS A FOR 
PROFIT ENTITY THAT GENERATED $4 
BILLION IN AD REVENUES AND 
FACEBOOK CLAIMS THAT 
ADVERTISING MAKES IT EASY TO 
FIND THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND 
CAPTURE ATTENTION AND GET 
RESULTS AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT 
AN AD SUPPORTED SERVICE IS BEST 
IN LINE WITH YOUR MISSION AND 
VALUES BUT THE REALITY IS THAT 
THERE ARE EXAMPLES WHERE AD 
TARGETING HAS LED TO RESULTS 
THAT WE WOULD ALL DISAGREE WITH 
OR DISLIKE OR WOULD CONCERN US. 
YOU HAVE ALREADY ADMITTED THAT 
FACEBOOK'S OWN AD TOOLS ALLOWED 
RUSSIANS TO TARGET VOTERS BASED 
ON RACE OR VIEWS AND THAT MAY 
HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE 
UNITED STATES.  
TIME LIFE MAGAZINE SAYS THERE 
ARE FACEBOOK TOOLS TO TIES 
SALES OF PROTECTED ANIMAL PARTS 
AND I AM QUESTIONING WHETHER 
THE TOOLS WOULD ALLOW OTHER 
CONCERNING QUESTIONS LIKE DIET 
PILL MANUFACTURERS TARGETING 
TEENAGERRING STRUGGLING WITH 
THEIR WEIGHT OR GAMBLING 
PROBLEMS.  
PRO PUBLICCA BACK IN 2016 
HIGHLIGHT THE THAT FACEBOOK 
LETS ADVERTISERS EXCLUDE USERS 
BY RACE.  
IN REAL ESTATE ADVERTISING.  
THERE WAS A WAY THAT YOU COULD 
SAY THAT THIS PARTICULAR AD I 
WANT WANT TO BE SEEN BY WHITE 
FOLKS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND 
THAT VIOLATES CLEAR HOUSING LAW 
AND OUR BASIC SENSE OF FAIRNESS 
IN THE UNITED STATES AND YOU 
PROMPTLY ANNOUNCED THAT WAS A 
BAD IDEA AND YOU WOULD CHANGE 
THE TOOLS AND BUILD A NEW 
SYSTEM TO SPOT DISCRIMINATORY 
ADS AND A YEAR LATER THOSE 
CHANGES HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND 
IT WAS POSSIBLE TO TARGET THE 
HOUSING TIME IN A WAY THAT WAS 
RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY.  
MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS 
PRACTICE OF MAKING BOLD AND 
ENGAGING PROMISES ABOUT CHANGES 
IN PRACTICES AND THE REALITY OF 
HOW FACEBOOK HAS OPERATED IN 
THE REAL WORLD ARE IN 
PERSISTENT TENSION.  
>> I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND 
WAS NOTIFIED BY A WHOLE GROUP 
OF FRIENDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
ASKING IF I HAD A NEW FAMILY OR 
IF THERE WAS A FAKE FACEBOOK 
POST OF CHRIS COONS. 
I WENT TO THE ONE THEY 
SUGGESTED THAT HAD A DIFFERENT 
MIDDLE INITIAL THAN MINE AND 
THERE WAS MY PICTURE WITH 
SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN'S FAMILY, 
SAME SCHOOLS I WENT TO BUT A 
WHOLE LOT OF RUSSIAN FRIENDS. 
DAN SULLIVAN HAS GOT A VERY 
ATTRACTIVE FAMILY, BY THE WAY. 
>> KEEP THAT FOR THE RECORD, 
MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THE FRIENDS WHO BROUGHT THAT 
TO MY ATTENTION INCLUDE PEOPLE 
I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL WITH IN 
HAWAII AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
IN DELAWARE. 
I BROUGHT IT TO FACEBOOK'S 
ATTENTION AND IT WAS TAKEN DOWN 
BY MIDDAY, BUT I'M LEFT WORRIED 
BY WHAT HAPPENS TO DELAWAREANS 
WHO DON'T HAVE THESE RESOURCES. 
IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO FIND 
RUSSIAN TROLLS OPERATING IN THE 
PLATFORM. 
HATE GROUPS THRIVE IN SOME 
AREAS OF FACEBOOK EVEN THOUGH 
YOUR POLICIES PROHIBIT HATE 
SPEECH AND YOU'VE TAKEN STRONG 
STEPS AGAINST EXTREMISM, BUT 
ARE THE DELAWAREANS NOT IN THE 
SENATE GOING TO GET THE SAME 
QUICK RESPONSE? 
I'VE GOTTEN INFORMATION FROM 
FRIENDS SAYING THEY'VE HAD 
TROUBLE GETTING A RESPONSE WHEN 
THEY'VE FOUND A FACEBOOK PAGE 
CLEARLY VIOLATING THEIR 
PRINCIPLES. 
MY CORE QUESTION IS ISN'T IT 
FACEBOOK'S JOB TO PROTECT USERS 
AND WHY DO YOU PUSH THE BURDEN 
TO USERS TO FLAG INAPPROPRIATE 
CONTENT AND BE SURE IT'S TAKEN 
DOWN? 
>> NOR, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
-- SENATOR, THERE ARE A NUMBER 
OF IMPORTANT POINTS IN THERE 
AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT 
THIS IS AN AREA WE NEED TO DO A 
LOT BETTER ON OVER TIME, 
CONTENT POLICY ENFORCEMENT. 
THE HISTORY OF HOW WE GOT HERE 
IS WE STARTED OFF IN MY DORM 
ROOM WITH NOT A LOT OF 
RESOURCES AND NOT HAVING THE AI 
TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO 
PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY A LOT OF 
THIS STUFF. 
SO JUST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER 
VOLUME OF CONTENT THE MAIN WAY 
THAT THIS WORKS TODAY IS THAT 
PEOPLE REPORT THINGS TO US AND 
THEN WE HAVE OUR TEAM REVIEW 
THAT AND AS I SAID BEFORE, BY 
THE END OF THIS YEAR WE'LL HAVE 
MORE THAN 20,000 PEOPLE AT THE 
COMPANY WORKING ON SECURITY AND 
CONTENT REVIEW BECAUSE THIS IS 
IMPORTANT. 
OVER TIME WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT 
INCREASINGLY TO A METHOD WHERE 
MORE OF THIS CONTENT IS FLAGGED 
UP FRONT BY AI TOOLS THAT WE 
DEVELOP. 
WE'VE PRIORITIZED THE MOST 
IMPORTANT TYPES OF CONTENT THAT 
WE CAN BUILD AI TOOLS FOR TODAY 
LIKE TERROR-RELATED CONTENT 
WHERE I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT 
OUR SYSTEMS THAT WE DEPLOY WHEN 
WE WERE TAKING DOWN 99% OF THE 
ISIS AND AL-QAEDA-RELATED 
CONTENT THAT WE TAKE DOWN 
BEFORE A PERSON EVEN FLAGS THEM 
TO US. 
IF WE FAST FORWARD FIVE OR 10 
YEARS, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE MORE AI TECHNOLOGY THAT 
CAN DO THAT IN MORE AREAS AND I 
THINK WE NEED TO GET THERE AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE, WHICH IS WHY 
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT. 
>> I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. 
I JUST THINK WE CAN'T WAIT FIVE 
YEARS TO GET HOUSING 
DISCRIMINATION AND PERSONALLY 
OFFENSIVE MATERIAL OUT OF 
FACEBOOK. 
THANK YOU. 
>> I AGREE. 
>> SENATOR SASSE. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANKS FOR 
BEING HERE. 
AT CURRENT PACE YOU'RE DUE TO 
BE DONE WITH FIRST ROUND OF 
QUESTIONING BY ABOUT 1 A.M. 
SO CONGRATULATIONS. 
I LIKE CHRIS COONS A LOT WITH 
HIS OWN FAMILY OR WITH DAN 
SULLIVAN'S FAMILY. 
BOTH ARE GREAT PHOTOS, BUT I 
HAVE A SIMILAR SET OF QUESTIONS 
FROM THE OTHER SIDE MAYBE. 
I THINK THE CONCEPTUAL LINE 
BETWEEN MERE TECH COMPANY, MERE 
TOOLS AND AN ACTUAL CONTENT 
COMPANY, I THINK IT'S REALLY 
HARD. 
I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE A HARD 
CHALLENGE. 
I THINK REGULATION OVER TIME 
WILL HAVE A HARD CHALLENGE AND 
YOU'RE A PRIVATE COMPANY, SO 
YOU CAN MAKE POLICIES THAT MAY 
BE LESS THAN 1st AMENDMENT FULL 
SPIRIT EMBRACING IN MY VIEW, 
BUT I WORRY ABOUT THAT. 
I WORRY ABOUT A WORLD WHERE 
WHEN YOU GO FROM VIOLENT GROUPS 
TO HATE SPEECH IN A HURRY IN 
ONE OF YOUR RESPONSES TO ONE OF 
THE OPENING QUESTIONS, YOU MAY 
DECIDE OR FACEBOOK MAY DECIDE 
IT NEEDS TO POLICE A WHOLE 
BUNCH OF SPEECH THAT I THINK 
AMERICA MIGHT BE BETTER OFF NOT 
HAVING MISSED BY ONE COMPANY 
THAT HAS A REALLY BIG AND 
POWERFUL PLATFORM. 
CAN YOU DEFINE HATE SPEECH? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK OF THIS AS 
A REALLY HARD QUESTION AND I 
THINK IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS 
WHY WE STRUGGLE WITH IT. 
THERE ARE CERTAIN DEFINITIONS 
THAT WE HAVE AROUND CALLING FOR 
VIOLENCE OR -- 
>> LET'S JUST AGREE ON THAT. 
IF SOMEBODY IS CALLING FOR 
VIOLENCE THAT, SHOULDN'T BE 
THERE. 
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE 
PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES AROUND 
SPEECH. 
YOU USE LANGUAGE OF SAFETY AND 
PROTECTION EARLIER. 
WE SEE THIS HAPPENING ON 
COLLEGE CAMPUSES AROUND THE 
COUNTRY. 
IT'S DANGEROUS. 
40% OF AMERICANS UNDER AGE 35 
TELL POLLSTERS THEY THINK  THE 
1st AMENDMENT IS DANGEROUS 
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT USE YOUR 
FREEDOM TO SAY SOMETHING THAT 
HURTS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FEELINGS. 
GUESS WHAT? 
THERE'S SOME REALLY 
PASSIONATELY HELD VIEWS ON THE 
ABORTION ISSUE ON THIS PANEL 
TODAY. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE 
PRO LIFERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM 
SPEAKING ABOUT THEIR VIEWS ON 
YOUR PLATFORM? 
>> I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT 
THAT TO BE THE CASE. 
>> BUT IT MIGHT REALLY BE 
UNSELLING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
HAD AN ABORTION TO -- 
UNSETTLING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
HAD AN ABORTION TO HAVE AN OPEN 
DEBATE ABOUT THAT, WOULDN'T IT? 
>> IT MIGHT BE, BUT I DON'T 
THINK THAT WOULD FIT ANY OF THE 
DEFINITIONS OF WHAT WE HAVE, 
BUT I DO GENERALLY AGREE WITH 
THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING, 
WHICH IS AS WE'RE ABLE TO 
TECHNOLOGICALLY SHIFT TOWARD 
ESPECIALLY HAVING AI 
PROACTIVELY LOOK AT CONTENT, I 
THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO 
CREATE MASSIVE QUESTIONS FOR 
SOCIETY ABOUT WHAT OBLIGATIONS 
WE WANT TO REQUIRE COMPANIES TO 
FULFILL AND I DO THINK THAT 
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE NEED 
TO STRUGGLE WITH AS A COUNTRY 
BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE. 
>> I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE 
HERE TODAY AND THINK THERE'S A 
UNIFIED VIEW IN THE CONGRESS 
THAT YOU SHOULD BE MOVING 
TOWARD POLICING MORE AND MORE 
SPEECH. 
I THINK VIOLENCE HAS NO PLACE 
ON YOUR PLATFORM. 
SEX TRAFFICKERS AND HUMAN 
TRAFFICKERS HAVE NO PLACE ON 
YOUR PLATFORM, BUT VIGOROUS 
DEBATES, ADULTS NEED TO ENGAGE 
IN VIGOROUS DEBATES. 
I HAVE ONLY A LITTLE LESS THAN 
TWO MINUTES LEFT. 
SO I WANT TO SHIFT GEARS, BUT 
THAT WAS ABOUT ADULTS. 
YOU'RE A DAD. 
I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION. 
YOU STARTED YOUR COMMENTS TODAY 
BY TALKING ABOUT HOW FACEBOOK 
IS AND WAS FOUNDED AS AN 
OPTIMISTIC COMPANY. 
YOU AND I HAVE HAD 
CONVERSATIONS SEPARATE FROM 
HERE. 
I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN 
YOUR MOUTH, BUT I THINK AS 
YOU'VE AGED YOU MIGHT BE A 
LITTLE BIT LESS IDEALISTIC AND 
OPTIMISTIC THAN WHEN YOU 
STARTED FACEBOOK. 
AS A DAD, DO YOU WORRY ABOUT 
SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION AS A 
PROBLEM FOR AMERICA'S TEENS? 
>> WELL, MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN 
BE IDEALISTIC BUT HAVE A BROAD 
VIEW OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY. 
TO YOUR POINT ABOUT TEENS, THIS 
IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I 
THINK ANY PARENT THINKS ABOUT 
IS HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT YOUR 
KIDS USING TECHNOLOGY? 
AT FACEBOOK SPECIFICALLY I VIEW 
OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS NOT JUST 
BUILDING SERVICES THAT PEOPLE 
LIKE, BUT BUILDING SERVICES 
THAT ARE GOOD FOR PEOPLE AND 
GOOD FOR SOCIETY AS WELL. 
SO WE STUDY A LOT OF EFFECTS OF 
WELL-BEING OF OUR TOOLS AND 
BROADER TECHNOLOGY. 
LIKE ANY TOOL THERE ARE GOOD 
AND BAD USES OF IT. 
WHAT WE FIND IN GENERAL IS THAT 
IF YOU'RE USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN 
ORDER TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS, 
RIGHT, SO YOU'RE SHARING 
CONTENT WITH FRIENDS, YOU'RE 
INTERACTING, THEN THAT IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF THE LONG 
TERM MEASURES OF WELL-BEING 
THAT YOU WOULD INTUITIVELY 
THINK OF, LONG TERM HEALTH, 
HAPPINESS, FEELING CONNECTED 
AND LESS LONELY, BUT IF YOU'RE 
USING THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL 
MEDIA TO PRIMARILY JUST 
PASSIVELY CONSUME CONTENT AND 
YOU'RE NOT ENGAGING  WITH OTHER 
PEOPLE, THEN IT DOESN'T HAVE 
THOSE POSITIVE EFFECTS AND IT 
COULD BE NEGATIVE. 
>> WE'RE ALMOST AT TIME. 
DO SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HIRE 
CONSULTING FIRMS TO HELP THEM 
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE 
DOPAMINE FEEDBACK LOOPS SO THAT 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE 
PLATFORM? 
>> NO, SENATOR. 
THAT'S NOT HOW WE TALK ABOUT 
THIS OR HOW WE SET UP OUR 
PRODUCT TEAMS. 
WE WANT OUR PRODUCTS TO BE 
VALUABLE TO PEOPLE AND IF 
THEY'RE VALUABLE, PEOPLE CHOOSE 
TO USE THEM. 
>> ARE YOU AWARE THERE ARE 
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THAT DO 
HIRE SUCH CONSULTANTS? 
>> NOT SITTING HERE TODAY. 
>> THANKS. 
>> SENATOR MARKEY. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR 
BLUMENTHAL'S POINTED QUESTIONS, 
YOU REFUSED TO ANSWER WHETHER 
FACEBOOK SHOULD BE REQUIRED BY 
LAW TO OBTAIN CLEAR PERMISSION  
SHARING THEIR PERSONAL 
INFORMATION. 
SO I'M GOING TO ASK IT ONE MORE 
TIME, YES OR NO. 
SHOULD FACEBOOK GET CLEAR 
PERMISSION FROM USERS BEFORE 
SELLING OR SHARING SENSITIVE 
INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, 
YOUR FINANCES, YOUR 
RELATIONSHIPS? 
SHOULD YOU HAVE TO GET THEIR 
PERMISSION? 
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY A CONSENT 
DECREE WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE 
COMMISSION THAT YOU SIGNED IN 
2011. 
SHOULD YOU HAVE TO GET 
PERMISSION? 
SHOULD THE CONSUMER HAVE TO OPT 
IN? 
>> SENATOR, WE DO REQUIRE 
PERMISSION TO USE THE SYSTEM 
AND TO PUT INFORMATION IN THERE 
AND FOR ALL THE USES OF IT. 
I WANT TO BE CLEAR. 
WE DON'T SELL INFORMATION. 
SO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE 
COULD GET PERMISSION TO DO 
THAT, THAT'S JUST NOT A THING 
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO DO. 
>> SO WOULD YOU SUPPORT 
LEGISLATION? 
I HAVE A BILL. 
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL REFERRED TO 
IT, THE CONSENT ACT THIS WOULD 
JUST PUT ON THE BOOKS A LAW 
THAT SAID THAT FACEBOOK AND ANY 
OTHER COMPANY THAT GATHERS 
INFORMATION ABOUT AMERICANS HAS 
TO GET THEIR PERMISSION, THEIR 
AFFIRMATIVE PERMISSION, BEFORE 
IT CAN BE REUSED FOR OTHER 
PURPOSES. 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT 
LEGISLATION TO MAKE IT A 
NATIONAL STANDARD FOR NOT JUST 
FACEBOOK, BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER 
COMPANIES OUT THERE, SOME OF 
THEM BAD ACTORS? 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT 
LEGISLATION? 
>> SENATOR, IN GENERAL I THINK 
THAT THAT PRINCIPLE IS EXACTLY 
RIGHT AND I THINK WE SHOULD 
HAVE A DISCUSSION AROUND HOW TO 
BEST CODIFY THAT. 
>> BUT WOULD YOU SUPPORT 
LEGISLATION TO BACK THAT 
GENERAL PRINCIPLE, THAT OPT IN, 
THAT GETTING PERMISSION IS THE 
CENTER? 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT LEGISLATION 
AND MAKE THAT THE AMERICAN 
STANDARD? 
EUROPEANS PASSED THAT AS A LAW. 
FACEBOOK WILL LIVE WITH THAT 
LAW BEGINNING MAY 25th. 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT AS THE 
LAW IN THE UNITED STATES? 
>> SENATOR, AS A PRINCIPLE, 
YES, I WOULD. 
I THINK THE DETAILS MATTER A 
LOT. 
>> RIGHT. 
ASSUMING WE WORKED OUT THE 
DETAILS YOU DO SUPPORT OPT IN 
AS THE STANDARD, GETTING 
PERMISSION AFFIRMATIVELY AS THE 
STANDARD FOR THE UNITED STATES? 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THAT'S 
THE RIGHT PRINCIPLE AND 100 
BILLION TIMES A DAY IN OUR 
SERVICES WHEN PEOPLE GO TO 
SHARE CONTENT THEY CHOOSE WHO 
THEY WANT TO SHARE IT WITH 
AFFIRMATIVELY. 
>> SO YOU COULD SUPPORT A LAW 
THAT ENSHRINES THAT AS THE 
PROMISE THAT WE MAKE TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT PERMISSION 
HAS TO BE OBTAINED BEFORE THEIR 
INFORMATION IS USED. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> SENATOR, YES. 
I SAID THAT IN PRINCIPLE I 
THINK THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AND 
THE DETAILS MATTER AND I LOOK 
FORWARD TO HAVING OUR TEAM WORK 
WITH YOU ON FLUSHING THAT OUT. 
>> RIGHT. 
SO THE NEXT SUBJECT BECAUSE I 
WANT TO AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT WE 
KIND OF DRILL DOWN HERE, YOU 
EARLIER MADE REFERENCE TO THE 
CHILD ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION 
ACT OF 1999 WHICH I AM THE 
AUTHOR OF. 
SO THAT IS THE CONSTITUTION FOR 
CHILD PRIVACY PROTECTION ONLINE 
IN THE COUNTRY AND I'M VERY 
PROUD OF THAT, BUT THERE ARE NO 
PROTECTIONS ADDITIONALLY FOR 13 
OR 14 OR 15-YEAR-OLDS. 
THEY GET THE SAME PROTECTIONS 
THAT A 30-YEAR-OLD OR A 50-YEAR-
OLD GET. 
SO I HAVE A SEPARATE PIECE OF 
LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT KIDS 
WHO ARE UNDER 16 ABSOLUTELY 
HAVE A PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS 
AND THAT PERMISSION HAS TO BE 
RECEIVED FROM THEIR PARENTS OR 
THE CHILDREN BEFORE ANY OF 
THEIR INFORMATION IS REUSED FOR 
ANY OTHER PURPOSE OTHER THAN 
THAT WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY 
INTENDED. 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT A CHILD 
ONLINE PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS 
FOR KIDS UNDER 16 TO GUARANTEE 
THAT THAT INFORMATION IS NOT 
REUSED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE 
WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION 
FROM THE PARENTS OR THE KIDS? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK AS A 
GENERAL PRINCIPLE, I THINK 
PROTECTING MINORS AND 
PROTECTING THEIR PRIVACY IS 
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE DO A 
NUMBER OF THINGS ON FACEBOOK TO 
DO THAT ALREADY, WHICH I'M 
HAPPY TO -- 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT A LAW. 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT A LAW TO 
ENSURE THAT KIDS UNDER 16 HAVE 
THIS PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS? 
I HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH 
YOU IN YOUR OFFICE SEVEN YEARS 
AGO ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC SUBJECT 
IN PALO ALTO AND I THINK THAT'S 
REALLY WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WANT TO KNOW RIGHT NOW. 
WHAT IS THE PROTECTIONS? 
WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS THAT 
ARE GOING TO BE PUT ON THE 
BOOKS FOR THEIR FAMILIES, BUT 
ESPECIALLY FOR THEIR CHILDREN? 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT A PRIVACY 
BILL OF RIGHTS FOR KIDS WHERE 
OPT IN IS THE STANDARD, YES OR 
NO? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THAT'S 
AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 
THAT'S MY QUESTION TO YOU. 
DO YOU BELIEVE WE NEED A LAW TO 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT SURE IF WE 
NEED A LAW, BUT I THINK THIS IS 
CERTAINLY A THING THAT DESERVES 
A LOT OF DISCUSSION. 
>> I COULDN'T DISAGREE WITH YOU 
MORE. 
WE'RE LEAVING THESE CHILDREN TO 
THE MOST REFATIOUS COMMERCIAL 
-- REPATIOUS COMMERCIAL 
PREDATORS IN THE COUNTRY. 
>> PLEASE GIVE A SHORT ANSWER. 
>> SENATOR, I LOOK FORWARD TO 
HAVING MY TEAM FOLLOW UP TO 
FLUSH OUT THE DETAILS OF IT. 
>> SENATOR FLAKE. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 
THANKS FOR ENDURING SO FAR AND 
I'M SORRY IF I PLOW OLD GROUND. 
I HAD TO BE AWAY FOR A BIT. 
I MYSELF AND SENATOR COONS, 
SENATOR PETERS AND A FEW OTHERS 
WERE IN THE COUNTRY OF ZIMBABWE 
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. 
WE MET WITH OPPOSITION FIGURES 
WHO HAD TALKED ABOUT THEIR GOAL 
IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO 
STATE RUN MEDIA IN MANY AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES, MANY COUNTRIES 
AROUND THE WORLD, THIRD WORLD 
COUNTRIES, SMALL COUNTRIES. 
THE ONLY TRADITIONAL MEDIA IS 
STATE RUN AND WE ASKED THEM HOW 
THEY GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT AND 
IT'S THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. 
FACEBOOK PROVIDES A VERY 
VALUABLE SERVICE IN MANY 
COUNTRIES FOR OPPOSITION 
LEADERS OR OTHERS WHO SIMPLY 
DON'T HAVE ACCESS UNLESS MAYBE 
JUST BEFORE AN ELECTION TO 
TRADITIONAL MEDIA. 
SO THAT'S VERY VALUABLE AND I 
THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT. 
ON THE FLIP SIDE WE'VE SEEN 
WITH THE ROHINGYA, THAT EXAMPLE 
OF WHERE THE STATE CAN USE 
SIMILAR DATA OR USE THIS 
PLATFORM TO GO AFTER PEOPLE. 
YOU TALKED ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE 
DOING IN THAT REGARD, HIRING 
MORE TRADITIONAL OR LOCAL 
LANGUAGE SPEAKERS. 
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU DOING IN THAT 
REGARD TO ENSURE THAT THESE 
STATES DON'T -- OR THESE 
GOVERNMENTS DON'T GO AFTER 
OPPOSITION FIGURES OR OTHERS? 
>> SENATOR, THERE ARE THREE 
MAIN THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING IN 
MYANMAR SPECIFICALLY AND THAT 
WILL APPLY TO OTHER SITUATIONS 
LIKE THAT. 
THE FIRST IS HIRING ENOUGH 
PEOPLE TO DO LOCAL LANGUAGE 
SUPPORT BECAUSE THE DEFINITION 
OF HATE SPEECH OR THINGS THAT 
CAN BE RACIALLY CODED TO INCITE 
VIOLENCE ARE VERY LANGUAGE 
SPECIFIC AND WE CAN'T DO THAT 
WITH JUST ENGLISH SPEAKERS FOR 
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. 
SO WE NEED TO GROW THAT. 
THE SECOND IS IN THESE 
COUNTRIES THERE TEND TO BE 
ACTIVE CIVIL SOCIETY WHO CAN 
HELP US IDENTIFY THE FIGURES 
WHO ARE SPREADING HATE AND WE 
CA WORK WITH THEM IN ORDER TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FIGURES 
DON'T HAVE A PLACE ON OUR 
PLATFORM. 
THE THIRD IS THAT THERE ARE 
SPECIFIC PRODUCT CHANGES THAT 
WE CAN MAKE THAT MIGHT BE 
NECESSARY IN SOME COUNTRIES, 
BUT NOT OTHERS INCLUDING THINGS 
AROUND NEWS LITERACY, RIGHT? 
AND LIKE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE IN 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ABOUT 
RAMPING UP OUR DOWN THINGS WE 
MIGHT DO AROUND FACT CHECKING 
OF CONTENT, SPECIFIC PRODUCT 
TYPE THINGS THAT WE WOULD WANT 
TO IMPLEMENT IN DIFFERENT 
PLACES, BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S 
SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 
TO DO IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES. 
>> THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY LIMITS 
OF NATIVE SPEAKERS YOU CAN HIRE 
OR PEOPLE THAT HAVE EYES ON THE 
PAGE. 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE BULK 
OF THIS. 
HOW MUCH ARE YOU INVESTING AND 
WORKING ON THAT TOOL TO DO WHAT 
REALLY WE DON'T HAVE OR CAN'T 
HIRE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK YOU'RE 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT OVER THE 
LONG TERM BUILDING AI TOOLS IS 
GOING TO BE THE SCALABLE WAY TO 
IDENTIFY AND ROOT OUT MOST OF 
THIS HARMFUL CONTENT. 
WE'RE INVESTING A LOT IN DOING 
THAT AS WELL AS SCALING UP THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING 
CONTENT REVIEW. 
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE 
MENTIONED IS THIS YEAR OR IN 
THE LAST YEAR WE'VE BASICALLY 
DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
DOING SECURITY AND CONTENT 
REVIEW. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE THAN 
20,000 PEOPLE WORKING ON 
SECURITY AND CONTENT REVIEW BY 
THE END OF THIS YEAR. 
SO IT'S GOING TO BE COUPLING 
CONTINUING TO GROW THE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE DOING REVIEW IN THESE 
PLACES WITH BUILDING AI TOOLS. 
WE'RE WORKING AS QUICKLY AS WE 
CAN ON THAT, BUT SOME OF THE 
STUFF IS JUST HARD. 
THAT I THINK WILL HELP US GET 
TO A BETTER PLACE ON 
ELIMINATING MORE OF THIS 
HARMFUL CONTENT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
YOU'VE TALKED SOME ABOUT THAT, 
I KNOW. 
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA OR 
CHINESE GOVERNMENTS HAVE 
HARVESTED FACEBOOK DATA AND 
HAVE DETAILED DATA SETS ON 
FACEBOOK USERS? 
HAS YOUR FORENSIC ANALYSIS 
SHOWN YOU WHO ELSE OTHER THAN 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA DOWNLOADED 
THIS KIND OF DATA? 
>> SENATOR, WE HAVE KICKED OFF 
AN INVESTIGATION OF EVERY APP 
THAT HAD ACCESS TO A LARGE 
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE'S DATA BEFORE 
WE LOCKED DOWN THE PLATFORM IN 
2014. 
THAT'S UNDERWAY. 
I IMAGINE WE'LL FIND SOME 
THINGS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
TELLING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
AFFECTED WHEN WE DO. 
I DON'T THINK SITTING HERE 
TODAY THAT WE HAVE SPECIFIC 
KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER EFFORTS BY 
THOSE NATION STATES, BUT IN 
GENERAL WE ASSUME THAT A NUMBER 
OF COUNTRIES ARE TRYING TO 
ABUSE OUR SYSEMS. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THE NEXT PERSON IS SENATOR 
HERRANO. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THE U.S. 
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOM 
ENFORCEMENT HAS PROPOSED A NEW 
EXTREME VETTING INITIATIVE 
WHICH THEY HAVE RENAMED VISA 
LIFE CYCLE VETTING. 
THAT SOUNDS LESS SCARY. 
THEY HAVE ALREADY HELD AN 
INDUSTRY DAY THAT THEY 
ADVERTISED ON THE FEDERAL 
CONTRACTING WEBSITE TO GET 
INPUT FROM TECH COMPANIES ON 
THE BEST WAY TO AMONG OTHER 
THINGS AND I'M QUOTING I.C.E. 
EXPLOIT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE 
INFORMATION SUCH AS MEDIA, 
BLOGS, PUBLIC HEARINGS, 
CONFERENCES, ACADEMIC WEBSITES, 
SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES SUCH AS 
TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND LINKEDIN 
TO EXTRACT PERTINENT 
INFORMATION REGARDING TARGETS. 
BASICALLY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO 
WITH THESE TARGETS IS TO 
DETERMINE -- AND AGAIN I'M 
QUOTING THAT  I.C.E.'S OWN 
DOCUMENT, THEY WANT TO DEVELOP 
PROCESSES THAT DETERMINE AND 
EVALUATE AN APPLICANT I.E. úTAR 
BECOMING A POSITIVELY 
CONTRIBUTING MEMBER TO SOCIETY 
AND CONTRIBUTING TO NATIONAL 
INTERESTS TO MEET THE EXECUTIVE 
ORDER BY THE PRESIDENT. 
THEN I.C.E. 
MUST ALSO DEVELOP A MECHANISM 
OR METHODOLOGY THAT ALLOWS THEM 
TO ASSESS WHETHER AN APPLICANT 
INTENDS TO COMMIT CRIMINAL OR 
TERRORIST ACTS AFTER ENTERING 
THE UNITED STATES. 
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS DOES 
FACEBOOK PLAN TO COOPERATE WITH 
THIS EXTREME VETTING INITIATIVE 
AND HELP THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION TARGET PEOPLE 
FOR DEPORTATION OR OTHER I.C.E. 
ENFORCEMENT? 
>> SENATOR, I DON'T KNOW THAT 
WE'VE HAD SPECIFIC 
CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT. 
IN GENERAL -- 
>> YOU WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE OR 
COOPERATE WITH I.C.E. 
SO THAT THEY COULD DETERMINE 
WHETHER SOMEBODY IS GOING TO 
COMMIT A CRIME, FOR EXAMPLE, OR 
BECOME FRUITFUL MEMBERS OF OUR 
SOCIETY, WOULD YOU COOPERATE? 
>> WE WOULD NOT PROACTIVELY DO 
THAT. 
WE COOPERATE WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT IN TWO CASES. 
ONE IS IF WE BECOME AWARE OF AN 
IMMINENT THREAT OF HARM, THEN 
WE WILL PROACTIVELY REACH OUT 
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WE 
BELIEVE IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY 
TO DO. 
THE OTHER IS WHEN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT REACHES OUT TO US 
WITH A VALID LEGAL SUBPOENA OR 
REQUEST FOR DATA. 
IN THOSE CASES IF THEIR REQUEST 
IS OVERLY BROAD OR WE BELIEF 
IT'S NOT A LEGAL REQUEST, THEN 
WE'LL -- BELIEVE IT'S NOT A 
LEGAL REQUEST, THEN WE'LL PUSH 
BACK AGGRESSIVELY. 
>> LET'S ASSUME THERE'S NO LAW 
OR RULE THAT REQUIRES THAT 
FACEBOOK COOPERATE TO ALLOW 
I.C.E. 
TO GET THIS KIND OF INFORMATION 
SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE THOSE 
KINDS OF ASSESSMENTS. 
IT SOUNDS TO ME AS THOUGH YOU 
WOULD DECLINE. 
>> SENATOR, THAT IS CORRECT. 
>> IS THERE SOME WAY -- WELL, I 
KNOW THAT YOU DETERMINE WHAT 
KIND OF CONTENT WOULD BE DEEMED 
HARMFUL. 
SO DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I.C.E. 
CAN EVEN DO WHAT THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT, NAMELY THROUGH A 
COMBINATION OF VARIOUS KINDS OF 
INFORMATION INCLUDING 
INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULD 
HOPE TO OBTAIN FROM ENTITIES 
SUCH AS YOURS PREDICT WHO WILL 
PREDICT CRIMES OR PRESENT A 
NATIONAL SECURITY PROBLEM? 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S EVEN 
DOABLE? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT FAMILIAR 
ENOUGH WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
TO OFFER AN INFORMED OPINION ON 
THAT. 
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO MAKE 
ASSESSMENTS AS TO WHAT 
CONSTITUTES HATE SPEECH. 
THAT'S PRETTY HARD TO DO. 
YOU HAVE TO ASSESS WHAT 
ELECTION INTERFERENCE IS. 
SO THESE ARE RATHER DIFFICULT 
TO IDENTIFY, BUT WOULDN'T 
TRYING TO PREDICT WHETHER 
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO COMMIT A 
CRIME FIT INTO THE CATEGORY OF 
PRETTY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS? 
>> SENATOR, IT SOUNDS DIFFICULT 
TO ME. 
ALL THESE THINGS LIKE YOU'RE 
SAYING ARE DIFFICULT. 
I DON'T KNOW WITHOUT HAVING 
WORKED ON IT OR THINKING ABOUT 
IT HOW MUCH PROGRESS ONE WOULD 
MAKE. 
>> I THINK SOMEONE COULD TELL 
US THAT THAT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT 
AND YET THAT'S WHAT I.C.E. 
IS PROCEEDING TO DO. 
YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT 
DISCRIMINATORY ADVERTISING AND 
IN FEBRUARY OF 2017 FACEBOOK 
ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD NO 
LONGER ALLOW CERTAIN KINDS OF  
ADS THAT DISCRIMINATED ON A 
BASIS OF RACE, GENDER, FAMILY 
STATUS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, 
DISABILITY OR VETERAN STATUS, 
ALL CATEGORIES PROHIBITED BY 
FEDERAL LAW IN HOUSING AND YET 
AFTER 2017 IT WAS DISCOVERED 
THAT YOU COULD, IN FACT, PLACE 
THOSE KINDS OF ADS. 
SO WHAT IS THE STATUS AS TO 
WHETHER OR NOT THESE KIND OF 
ADS COULD BE PLACED ON FACEBOOK 
AND HAVE YOU FOLLOWED THROUGH 
ON YOUR FEBRUARY, 2017 PROMISE 
TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND IS 
THERE A WAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO 
VERIFY THAT YOU HAVE OR ARE WE 
JUST EXPECTED TO TRUST THAT 
YOU'VE DONE THIS? 
>> SENATOR, THOSE ARE ALL 
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND IN 
GENERAL IT IS AGAINST OUR 
POLICIES TO HAVE ANY ADS THAT 
ARE DISCRIMINATORY. 
>> YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T ALLOW 
IT, BUT THEN PRO PUBLICA COULD 
PLACE THESE ADS EVEN AFTER YOU 
SAID YOU NO LONGER WOULD ALLOW 
THESE KIND OF ADS. 
SO WHAT ASSURANCE DO WE HAVE 
FROM YOU THIS IS GOING TO STOP? 
>> WELL, TWO THINGS. 
ONE IS THAT WE'VE REMOVED THE 
ABILITY TO EXCLUDE ETHNIC 
GROUPS AND OTHER SENSITIVE 
CATEGORIES FROM AD TARGETING. 
SO THAT JUST ISN'T A FEATURE 
THAT'S EVEN AVAILABLE ANYMORE. 
FOR SOME OF THESE CASES WHERE 
IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO TARGET 
PROACTIVELY A GROUP, THE 
ENFORCEMENT TODAY IS STILL WE 
REVIEW ADS. 
WE SCREEN THEM UP FRONT, BUT 
MOST OF THE ENFORCEMENT TODAY 
IS STILL THAT OUR COMMUNITY 
FLAGS ISSUES FOR US WHEN THEY 
COME UP. 
SO IF THE COMMUNITY FLAGS THAT 
ISSUE FOR US, THEN OUR TEAM, 
WHICH HAS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
WORKING ON IT, SHOULD TAKE IT 
DOWN. 
WE'LL MAKE SOME MISTAKES, BUT 
WE TRY TO MAKE AS FEW AS 
POSSIBLE. 
OVER TIME I THINK THE STRATEGY 
WOULD BE TO DEVELOP MORE AI 
TOOLS THAT CAN MORE PROACTIVELY 
IDENTIFY THOSE TYPES OF CONTENT 
AND DO THAT FILTERING UP FRONT. 
>> SO IS THE WORK IN PROGRESS? 
>> THANK YOU. 
SENATOR SULLIVAN IS UP NEXT. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, QUITE A STORY, 
RIGHT? 
DORM ROOM TO THE BEHEMOTH THAT 
YOU GUYS ARE. 
ONLY IN AMERICA. 
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 
>> SENATOR, MOSTLY IN AMERICA. 
>> YOU COULDN'T DO THIS IN 
CHINA, RIGHT, WHAT YOU DID IN 
10 YEARS? 
>> THERE ARE SOME VERY STRONG 
CHINESE INTERNET COMPANIES. 
>> RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED 
TO ANSWER YES TO THIS QUESTION. 
 
>> OKAY. 
COME ON. 
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU, RIGHT? 
GIVE ME A BREAK. 
THE ANSWER IS YES, OKAY? 
SO THANK YOU. 
 
>> NOW YOUR TESTIMONY, YOU HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF POWER. 
YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN 
ELECTIONS REALLY ALL OVER THE 
WORLD. 
FACEBOOK, 2 BILLION USERS, OVER 
200 MILLION AMERICANS, 40 
BILLION IN REVENUE. 
I BELIEVE YOU AND GOOGLE HAVE 
ALMOST 75% OF THE DIGITAL 
ADVERTISING IN THE U.S. ONE OF 
THE KEY ISSUES HERE, IS 
FACEBOOK TOO POWERFUL? 
ARE YOU TOO POWERFUL? 
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TOO 
POWERFUL? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK MOST 
OF THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE TALK 
ABOUT OUR SCALE, THEY'RE 
REFERENCING THAT WE HAVE 2 
BILLION PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY 
AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIG 
QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO THINK 
THROUGH HERE IS THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF THOSE 2 BILLION 
PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. 
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S 
SOMETHING THAT TO YOUR POINT 
THAT AMERICANS SHOULD BE PROUD 
OF. 
WHEN I BROUGHT UP THE CHINESE 
INTERNET COMPANIES, I THINK 
THAT THAT'S A REAL STRATEGIC 
AND COMPETITIVE THREAT THAT AN 
AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY POLICY 
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. 
>> I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT, 
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
KIND OF THE HISTORY OF THIS 
COUNTRY AND YOU LOOK AT THE 
HISTORY OF THESE KIND OF 
HEARINGS, RIGHT, YOU'RE A SMART 
GUY. 
YOU READ A LOT OF HISTORY. 
WHEN COMPANIES BECOME BIG AND 
POWERFUL AND ACCUMULATE A LOT 
OF WELL AND POWER, WHAT 
TYPICALLY HAPPENS FROM THIS 
BODY IS THERE'S AN INSTINCT TO 
EITHER REGULATE OR BREAK UP, 
RIGHT? 
LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS 
NATION. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON 
THOSE TWO POLICY APPROACHES? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, I'M NOT THE 
TYPE OF PERSON WHO THINKS THAT 
ALL REGULATION IS BAD. 
SO I THINK THE INTERNET IS 
BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT 
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND I THINK 
WE NEED TO HAVE A FULL 
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS THE 
RIGHT REGULATION, NOT WHETHER 
IT SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE. 
>> LET ME TALK ABOUT THE 
TENSION THERE BECAUSE I THINK 
IT'S A GOOD POINT AND I 
APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING THAT. 
ONE OF MY WORRIES ON REGULATION 
AGAIN WITH A COMPANY OF YOUR 
SIZE, YOU'RE SAYING HEY, WE 
MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN BEING 
REGULATED, BUT AS YOU KNOW, 
REGULATIONS CAN ALSO CEMENT THE 
DOMINANT POWER. 
SO WHAT I DO MEAN BY THAT? 
YOU HAVE A LOT OF LOBBYISTS. 
I THINK EVERY LOBBYIST IN TOWN 
IS INVOLVED IN THIS HEARING IN 
SOME WAY OR ANOTHER, A LOT OF 
POWERFUL INTERESTS. 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH 
DODD FRANK. 
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AIMED 
AT THE BIG BANKS. 
THE REGULATIONS ENDED UP 
EMPOWERING THE BIG BANKS IN 
KEEPING THE SMALL BANKS DOWN. 
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A RISK 
GIVEN YOUR INFLUENCE THAT IF WE 
REGULATE, WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING 
TO REGULATE YOU INTO A POSITION 
OF CEMENTED AUTHORITY WHEN ONE 
OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS ABOUT 
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING IS THAT 
THE NEXT FACEBOOK, WHICH WE ALL 
WANT, THE GUY IN THE DORM ROOM, 
WE ALL WANT THAT TO START IT, 
THAT YOU ARE BECOMING SODOM THE 
MAN THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HAVE 
THAT NEXT -- SO DOMINANT THAT 
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HAVE THE NEXT 
 
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ON THAT? 
>> SENATOR, I AGREE WITH YOUR 
POINT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING 
ABOUT REGULATION ACROSS ALL 
INDUSTRIES, YOU NEED TO BE 
CAREFUL THAT IT DOESN'T CEMENT 
IN THE CURRENT COMPANIES THAT 
ARE WINNING. 
>> BUT WOULD YOU TRY TO DO 
THAT? 
ISN'T THAT THE NORMAL 
INCLINATION OF A COMPANY, TO 
SAY HEY, I'M GOING TO HIRE THE 
BEST GUYS IN TOWN AND I'M GOING 
TO CEMENT IN AN ADVANTAGE. 
YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT IF WE WERE 
REGULATING YOU? 
>> SENATOR, THAT CERTAINLY 
WOULDN'T BE OUR APPROACH, BUT I 
THINK PART OF THE CHALLENE 
WITH REGULATION IN GENERAL IS 
WHEN YOU ADD MORE RULES 
COMPANIES NEED TO FOLLOW, 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A LARGER 
COMPANY LIKE OURS INHERENTLY 
JUST HAS THE RESOURCES TO GO 
DOWN DEW AND THAT MIGHT JUST BE 
HARDER FOR -- DO AND THAT MIGHT 
JUST BE HARDER FOR A SMALL 
COMPANY JUST GETTING STARTED TO 
COMPLY WITH. 
I THINK THERE ARE REAL 
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AROUND 
CONTENT AND PRIVACY AND A 
NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS, ADS 
TRANSPARENCIES, ELECTIONS. 
>> I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT 
LET ME GET TO ONE FINAL 
QUESTION THAT KIND OF REALS TO 
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN 
TERM OF CONTENT, REGULATION AND 
WHAT EXACTLY FACEBOOK IS. 
YOU MENTION YOU'RE A TECH 
COMPANY, A PLATFORM, BUT 
THERE'S SOME WHO ARE SAYING 
YOU'RE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST 
PUBLISHER. 
I THINK ABOUT 140 MILLION 
AMERICANS GET THEIR NEWS FROM 
FACEBOOK AND WHEN YOU MENTIONED 
TO SENATOR ORNYN, YOU SAID YOU 
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR 
CONTENT. 
SO WHICH ARE YOU? 
ARE YOU A TECH COMPANY OREGON 
THE WORLD'S LARGEST PUBLISHER 
-- COMPANY OR ARE YOU THE 
WORLD'S LARGEST PUBLISHER 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT GOES TO A 
REAL PORN QUESTION ON WHAT FORM 
OF REGULAR -- REAL IMPORTANT 
QUESTION ON WHAT FORM OF 
REGULATION OR GOVERNMENT 
ACTION, IF ANY, WE WOULD TAKE. 
>> SENATOR, THIS IS A REALLY 
BIG QUESTION. 
I VIEW US AS A TECH COMPANY 
BECAUSE THE PRIMARY THING WE DO 
IS BUILD TECHNOLOGY AND 
PRODUCTS. 
>> YOU SAID YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR YOUR CONTENT WHICH MAKES 
YOU KIND OF A PUBLISHER, RIGHT? 
>> WE DON'T PRODUCE THE 
CONTENT. 
MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE 
HEART OF WHAT THEY'RE REALLY 
GETTING AT IS DO WE FEEL A 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT 
ON OUR PLATFORM? 
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS CLEARLY 
YES, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S 
INCOMPATIBLE WITH FUNDAMENTALLY 
AT OUR CORE BEING A TECHNOLOGY 
COMPANY WHERE THE MAIN THING WE 
DO IS HAVE ENGINEERS AND BUILD 
PRODUCTS. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR SULLIVAN. 
SENATOR UDALL. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, AND 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 
ZUCKERBERG, FOR BEING HERE 
TODAY. 
YOU SPOKE VERY IDEALISTICALLY 
ABOUT YOUR COMPANY AND YOU 
TALKED ABOUT THE STRONG VALUES 
AND YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE A 
POSITIVE FORCE IN THE COMMUNITY 
AND THE WORLD AND YOU WERE 
HIJACKED BY CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. 
ARE YOU ANGRY ABOUT THAT? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> AND YOU'RE DETERMINED AND I 
ASSUME YOU WANT CHANGES MADE IN 
THE LAW. 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT 
TODAY. 
>> SENATOR, THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING THAT I CARE ABOUT RIGHT 
NOW IS MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE 
INTERFERES IN THE VARIOUS 2018 
ELECTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. 
WE HAVE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT 
U.S. MIDTERM. 
WE HAVE MAJOR ELECTIONS IN 
INDIA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, 
PAKISTAN, HUNGARY COMING UP AND 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A NUMBER OF 
MEASURES FROM BUILDING IN 
DEPLOYING NEW AI TOOLS THAT 
TAKE DOWN FAKE NEWS TO GROWING 
OUR SECURITY TAME TO MORE THAN 
20,000 PEOPLE TO MAKE -- TEAM 
TO MORE THAN 20,000 PEOPLE TO 
MAKING IT SO WE VERIFY EVERY 
ADVERTISER WHO IS DOING 
POLITICAL AND ISSUE ADS TO MAKE 
SURE THAT KIND OF INTERFERENCE 
THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE ABLE TO 
DO IN 2016 IS GOING TO BE MUCH 
HARDER FOR ANYONE TO PULL OFF 
IN THE FUTURE. 
>> AND I THINK YOU'VE SAID 
EARLIER THAT YOU SUPPORT THE 
HONEST ADS ACT. 
SO I ASSUME THAT MEANS YOU WANT 
CHANGES IN THE LAW IN ORDER TO 
EFFECTUATE EXACTLY WHAT YOU 
TALKED ABOUT. 
>> SENATOR, YES. 
WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THE HONEST 
ADS ACT. 
>> ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK 
UP HERE AND BE A STRONG 
ADVOCATE TO SEE THAT THAT LAW 
IS PASSED? 
>> SENATOR, THE BIGGEST THING 
THAT I THINK WE CAN DO IS 
IMPLEMENT IT. 
>> THAT'S KIND OF A YES OR NO 
QUESTION THERE. 
I HATE TO INTERRUPT YOU, BUT 
ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK AND 
BE A STRONG ADVOCATE. 
YOU'RE ANGRY ABOUT THIS. 
YOU THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE 
CHANGE AND A LAW PUT IN PLACE. 
ARE YOU GOING TO BE AN ADVOCATE 
TO GET A LAW IN PLACE LIKE 
THAT? 
>> SENATOR, OUR TEAM IS 
CERTAINLY GOING TO WORK ON 
THIS. 
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU, ARE 
NOT YOUR TEAM. 
ARE YOU COMING BACK TO BE AN 
ADVOCATE FOR THAT LAW. 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE. 
YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT THIS. 
WE'RE UPSET ABOUT THIS. 
I'D LIKE A YES OR NO ANSWER 
ABOUT THIS. 
>> SENATOR, I'M POSTING AND 
SPEAKING OUT PUBLICLY ABOUT HOW 
IMPORTANT THIS IS. 
I DON'T COME TO WASHINGTON D.C. 
TOO OFTEN. 
I'M GOING TO DIRECT MY TEAM TO 
FOCUS ON THIS AND THE BIGGEST 
THING THAT I FEEL LIKE WE CAN 
DO IS IMPLEMENT IT, WHICH WE'RE 
DOING. 
>> WELL, THE BIGGEST THING YOU 
CAN DO IS BE A STRONG ADVOCATE 
YOURSELF PERSONALLY HERE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
JUST LET ME MAKE THAT CLEAR, 
BUT MANY OF US HAVE SEEN THE 
KINDS OF IMAGES SHOWN EARLIER 
BY SENATOR LEAHY. 
YOU SAW THOSE IMAGES THAT HE 
HELD UP. 
CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT ANY OF 
IMAGES THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED 
OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUSSIAN 
COMPANY INTERNET RESEARCH 
AGENCY HAVE BEEN PURGED FROM 
YOUR PLATFORM? 
>> SENATOR, NO, I CAN'T 
GUARANTEE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS 
AN ONGOING ARMS RACE. 
AS LONG AS THERE ARE PEOPLE 
SITTING IN RUSSIA WHOSE JOB IT 
IS TO TRY TO INTERFERE WITH 
ELECTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, 
THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING 
CONFLICT. 
WHAT I CAN COMMIT IS THAT WE'RE 
GOING TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY 
BECAUSE THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY 
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T 
SPREADING MISINFORMATION OR 
TRYING TO INTERFERE IN 
ELECTIONS ON FACEBOOK, BUT I 
DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A 
REALISTIC EXPECTATION TO ASSUME 
THAT AS LONG AS THERE ARE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN 
RUSSIA FOR WHOM THIS IS THEIR 
JOB THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 
ZERO AMOUNT OF THAT OR BE 100% 
SUCCESSFUL AT PREVENTING THAT. 
>> NOW BEYOND DISCLOSURE OF 
ONLINE ADS WHAT SPECIFIC STEPS 
ARE YOU TAKING TO ENSURE THAT 
FOREIGN MONEY IS NOT FINANCING 
POLITICAL OR ISSUE ADS ON 
FACEBOOK IN VIOLATION OF U.S. 
LAW? 
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE SUBMITS A 
DISCLOSURE THAT SAYS PAID FOR 
BY SOME 501C3 OR PAC, THAT 
PERSON HAS NO ONE IN THE U.S., 
HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT IS NOT 
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE? 
>> SENATOR, OUR VERIFICATION 
PROGRAM INVOLVES TWO PIECES. 
ONE IS VERIFYING THE IDENTITY 
OF THE PERSON WHO'S BUYING THE 
ADS THAT THEY HAVE A VALID 
GOVERNMENT IDENTITY. 
THE SECOND IS VERIFYING THEIR 
LOCATION. 
SO IF YOU'RE SITTING IN RUSSIA, 
FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU SAY THAT 
YOU'RE IN THE U.S., THEN WE'LL 
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A LOT HARDER 
TO DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE 
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IS MAIL A 
CODE TO THE ADDRESS YOU SAY 
YOU'RE AT AND IF YOU CAN'T GET 
ACCESS TO THAT CODE, YOU'RE NOT 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN ADS. 
>> NOW FACEBOOK IS CREATING AN 
INDEPENDENT GROUP TO STUDY THE 
ABUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN 
ELECTIONS. 
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT. 
WILL YOU COMMIT THAT ALL 
FINDINGS OF THIS GROUP ARE MADE 
PUBLIC NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY 
ABOUT FACEBOOK OR ITS BUSINESS 
MODEL? 
YES OR NO ANSWER. 
>> SENATOR, THAT'S THE PURPOSE 
OF THIS GROUP IS THAT FACEBOOK 
DOES NOT GET TO CONTROL WHAT 
THESE FOLKS PUBLISH. 
THESE ARE GOING TO BE 
INDEPENDENT ACADEMICS AND 
FACEBOOK HAS NO PRIOR 
PUBLISHING CONTROL. 
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO THE  
STUDIES THAT THEY'RE DOING AND 
PUBLISH THE RESULTS. 
>> YOU'RE FINE WITH THEM BEING 
PUBLIC AND WHAT'S THE TIMING ON 
GETTING THOSE OUT? 
>> SENATOR, WE'RE KICKING OFF 
THE RESEARCH NOW. 
OUR GOAL IS TO FOCUS ON BOTH 
PROVIDING IDEAS FOR PREVENTING 
INTERFERENCE IN 2018 AND BEYOND 
AND ALSO FOR HOLDING US 
ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKING SURE THAT 
THE MEASURES WE PUT IN PLACE 
ARE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT. 
SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WILL 
START TO SEE THE FIRST RESULTS 
LATER THIS YEAR. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR UDALL. 
SENATOR MORAN IS UP NEXT. 
I WOULD JUST SAY AGAIN FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO ARE HERE 
THAT AFTER A COUPLE MORE 
QUESTIONERS WE'LL PROBABLY GIVE 
THE WITNESS ANOTHER SHORT 
BREAK. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> WE'RE GETTING ABOUT ALMOST 
2/3 THROUGH THE LIST OF MEMBERS 
WHO ARE HERE TO ASK QUESTIONS. 
SENATOR MORAN. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR TESTIMONY AND PRESENCE 
HERE TODAY. 
ON MARCH THE 26th OF THIS YEAR 
THE FTC CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS 
INVESTIGATING FACEBOOK TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER ITS PRIVACY 
PRACTICES VIOLATED THE FTC ACT 
OR THE CONSENT ORDER THAT 
FACEBOOK ENTERED INTO WITH THE 
AGENCY IN 2011. 
I CHAIR THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE 
SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HAS 
JURISDICTION OVER THE FEDERAL 
TRADE COMMISSION. 
I REMAIN INTERESTED IN 
FACEBOOK'S ASSERTION THAT IT 
REJECTS ANY SUGGESTION OF 
VIOLATING THAT CONSENT ORDER. 
PART TWO OF THAT CONSENT ORDER 
REQUIRES THAT FACEBOOK "CLEARLY 
AND PROMINENTLY DISPLAY NOTICE 
AND OBTAIN USERS' AFFIRMATIVE 
CONSENT BEFORE SHARING THEIR 
INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD 
PARTY." 
MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE 
CASE OF APPROXIMATELY 87 
MILLION FACEBOOK FRIENDS HAVING 
THEIR DATA SHARED WITH A THIRD 
PARTY DUE TO THE CONSENT OF 
ONLY 300,000 CONSENTING USERS 
NOT VIOLATE THAT AGREEMENT? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, LIKE I SAID 
EARLIER, OUR VIEW IS THAT WE 
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT 
ORDER, BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE 
A BROADER RESPONSIBILITY TO 
PROTECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY EVEN 
BEYOND THAT AND IN THIS 
SPECIFIC CASE THE WAY THAT THE 
PLATFORM WORKED OR THAT YOU 
COULD SIGN INTO AN APP AND 
BRING SOME OF YOUR INFORMATION 
AND SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS' 
INFORMATION IS HOW WE EXPLAINED 
IT WOULD WORK. 
PEOPLE HAD SETTINGS TO THAT 
EFFECT. 
WE EXPLAINED AND THEY CONSENTED 
TO IT WORKING THAT WAY AND THE 
SYSTEM BASICALLY WORKED AS IT 
WAS DESIGNED. 
THE ISSUE IS THAT WE DESIGNED 
THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WASN'T 
GOOD AND NOW WE STARTING IN 
2014 HAVE CHANGED THE DESIGN OF 
THE SYSTEM SO THAT WAY IT JUST 
MASSIVELY RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT 
OF DATA ACCESS THAT A DEVELOPER 
COULD GET. 
GOING FORWARD -- 
>> I'M SORRY, THE 300,000 
PEOPLE THAT WERE TREATED IN A 
WAY THAT IS APPROPRIATE. 
THEY CONSENTED, BUT YOU'RE NOT 
SUGGESTING THAT THE FRIENDS 
CONSENTED. 
>> SENATOR, I BELIEVE THAT WE 
ROLLED OUT THIS DEVELOPER 
PLATFORM AND THAT WE EXPLAINED 
TO PEOPLE HOW IT WORKED AND 
THAT THEY DID CONSENT TO IT. 
IT MAKES SENSE I THINK TO GO 
THROUGH THE WAY THE PLATFORM 
WORKS. 
I MEAN IN 2007 WE ANNOUNCED THE 
FACEBOOK DEVELOPER PLATFORM AND 
THE IDEA WAS THAT YOU WANTED TO 
MAKE MORE EXPERIENCES SOCIAL. 
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU NIGHT 
WANT TO HAVE A CALENDAR -- 
MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A CALENDAR 
THAT CAN HAVE YOUR FRIENDS' 
BIRTHDAYS OR IT OR YOU MIGHT 
WANT YOUR ADDRESS BOOK TO HAVE 
YOUR FRIENDS' PICKS IN IT OR 
YOU MIGHT WANT A MAP THAT CAN 
SHOW YOUR FRIENDS' ADDRESSES ON 
IT. 
IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE NEEDED 
TO BUILD A TOOL THAT ALLOWED 
PEOPLE TO SIGN INTO AN APP AND 
BRING SOME OF THEIR INFORMATION 
AND SOME OF THEIR FRIENDS' 
INFORMATION TO THOSE APPS. 
WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS 
IS HOW IT WORKED AND WHEN 
PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR FACEBOOK, 
THEY SIGNED UP FOR THAT AS 
WELL. 
NOW A LOT OF GOOD USE CASES 
CAME FROM THAT. 
I MEAN THERE WERE GAMES THAT 
WERE BUILT. 
THERE WERE INTEGRATIONS WITH 
COMPANIES THAT I THINK WE'RE 
FAMILIAR WITH LIKE NETFLIX AND 
SPOTIFY, BUT OVER TIME WHAT 
BECAME CLEAR WAS THAT THAT ALSO 
ENABLED SOME ABUSE. 
THAT'S WHY IN 2014 WE TOOK THE 
STEP OF CHANGING THE PLATFORM 
SO NOW WHEN PEOPLE SIGN INTO AN 
APP, YOU DO NOT BRING SOME OF 
YOUR FRIENDS' INFORMATION WITH 
YOU. 
YOU ARE ONLY BRINGING YOUR OWN 
INFORMATION AND YOU'RE ABLE TO 
CONNECT WITH FRIENDS THAT HAVE 
ALSO AUTHORIZED THAT APP 
DRECTLY. 
>> LET ME TURN TO YOUR BUG 
BOUNTY PROGRAM. 
OUR SUBCOMMITTEE HAS HAD A 
HEARING IN REGARD TO BUG 
BOUNTY. 
YOUR PRESS RELEASE INDICATED 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE SIX CHANGES 
FACEBOOK INITIALLY OFFERED TO 
CRACK DOWN ON PLATFORM ABUSES 
WAS TO AWARD OUTSIDE PARTIES 
WHO FIND VULNERABILITIES. 
ONE CONCERN I HAVE REGARDING 
UTILITY OF THIS APPROACH IS 
THAT THE VULNERABILITY 
DISCLOSURE PROGRAMS ARE 
NORMALLY GEARED TOWARD 
IDENTIFYING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS 
TO DATA, NOT POINTING OUT DATA 
SHARING ARRANGEMENTS THAT 
LIKELY COULD HARM SOMEONE, BUT 
TECHNICALLY ABIDE BY COMPLEX 
CONSENT AGREEMENTS. 
HOW DO YOU SEE THE BUG BOUNTY 
PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE ANNOUNCED 
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THAT? 
>> SORRY. 
COULD YOU CLARIFY WHAT SPECIFIC 
-- 
>> HOW DO YOU SEE THAT THE BUG 
BOUNTY PROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE 
ANNOUNCED WILL DEAL WITH THE 
SHARING OF INFORMATION NOT 
PERMISSIBLE AS COMPARED TO JUST 
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO DATA? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT ACTUALLY 
SURE I UNDERSTAND THIS ENOUGH 
TO SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFIC POINT 
AND I CAN HAVE MY TEAM FOLLOW 
UP WITH YOU ON THE DETAILS OF 
THAT. 
IN GENERAL, BOUNTY PROGRAMS ARE 
AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE 
SECURITY ARSENAL FOR HARDENING 
A LOT OF SYSTEMS. 
I THINK WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT 
WE'RE GOING TO INVEST A LOT IN 
HARDENING OUR SYSTEMS OURSELVES 
AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO AUDIT 
AND INVESTIGATE A LOT OF THE 
FOLKS IN OUR ECOSYSTEM, BUT 
EVEN WITH THAT HAVING THE 
ABILITY TO ENLIST OTHER THIRD 
PARTIES OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY 
TO BE ABLE TO HELP US OUT BY 
GIVING THEM AN INCENTIVE TO 
POINT OUT WHEN THEY SEE ISSUES 
I THINK IS LIKELY GOING TO HELP 
US IMPROVE THE SECURITY OF THE 
PLATFORM OVERALL, WHICH IS WHY 
WE DID THIS. 
>> NEXT UP SENATOR BOOKER. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
HELLO, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 
AS YOU KNOW, MUCH OF MY LIFE 
HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON LOW INCOME 
COMMUNITIES, POOR COMMUNITIES, 
WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES AND 
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A 
FAIR SHAKE. 
THIS COUNTRY HAS A VERY BAD 
HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATORY 
PRACTICES TOWARDS LOW INCOME 
AMERICANS AND AMERICANS OF 
COLOR FROM THE RED LINING FHA 
PRACTICES AND UNTIL RECENTLY IN 
THE MORE DISCRIMINATORY 
PRACTICES IN THE MORTGAGE 
BUSINESS. 
I'VE ALWAYS SEEN TECHNOLOGY AS 
A PROMISE TO DEMOCRATIZE OUR 
NATIONS AND EXPAND 
OPPORTUNITIES, BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN HOW 
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS LIKE úFACE 
TO DOUBLE DOWN ON 
DISCRIMINATION AND GIVE PEOPLE 
MORE SOPHISTICATED TOOLS WITH 
WHICH TO DISCRIMINATE. 
IN 2016 PRO PUBLICA REVEALED 
THAT ADVERTISERS COULD USE A 
USER'S RACE TO MARKET 
CATEGORIES TO POTENTIALLY 
DISCRIMINATE OVERALL AGAINST 
FACEBOOK USERS IN THE AREAS OF 
HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT AND CREDIT 
ECHOING A DARK HISTORY IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND ALSO IN VIOLATION 
OF FEDERAL LAW. 
IN 2016 FACEBOOK COMMITTED TO 
FIXING THIS, THAT THE 
ADVERTISERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO 
THIS DATA, TO FIXING IT, BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY A YEAR LATER AS 
PRO PUBLICA'S ARTICLE SHOWED, 
THEY FOUND THE SYSTEM FACEBOOK 
BUILT WAS STILL ALLOWING 
HOUSING ADS WITHOUT -- TO GO 
FORWARD WITHOUT APPLYING THESE 
NEW RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE PUT 
ON. 
FACEBOOK THEN OPTED IN A SYSTEM 
THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH 
CAME THAT THEY COULD SELF-
CERTIFY THAT THEY WERE NOT 
ENGAGING IN THESE PRACTICES AND 
COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL LAW 
USING THIS SELF-CERTIFICATION 
WAY TO OVERCOME AND TO COMPLY 
WITH RATHER FACEBOOK'S ANTI-
DISCRIMINATION POLICY. 
UNFORTUNATELY IN A RECENT 
LAWSUIT AS OF FEBRUARY, 2018 
ALLEGES THAT DISCRIMINATORY ADS 
WERE STILL BEING CREATED ON 
FACEBOOK, STILL 
úDISPROPORTIONA 
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND 
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. 
GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU ALLOWED 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA TO SELF-
CERTIFY IN A WAY THAT AT LEAST 
I THINK YOU'VE EXPRESSED REGRET 
OVER, IS SELF-CERTIFICATION THE 
BEST AND STRONGEST WAY TO 
SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MISUSE OF 
YOUR PLATFORM AND PROTECT THE 
DATA OF USERS, NOT LET IT BE 
MANIPULATED IN SUCH A 
DISCRIMINATORY FASHION? 
>> SENATOR,  THIS IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT QUESTION. 
IN GENERAL I THINK OVER TIME 
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TOWARDS 
MORE PROACTIVE REVIEW WITH MORE 
AI TOOLS TO HELP FLAG 
PROBLEMATIC CONTENT. 
IN THE NEAR TERM WE HAVE A LOT 
OF CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM AND 
IT'S HARD TO REVIEW EVERY 
SINGLE THING UP FRONT. 
WE DO A QUICK SCREEN. 
BUT I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IN 
THIS SPECIFIC CASE I'M NOT 
HAPPY WITH WHERE WE ARE AND I 
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO REALLY 
FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT THESE 
AREAS GET MORE REVIEW SOONER. 
>> I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
THERE IS A GROWING DISTRUST. 
I KNOW A LOT OF CIVIL RIGHTS 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MET WITH YOU 
ABOUT FACEBOOK'S SENSE OF 
URGENCY TO ADDRESS THESE 
ISSUES. 
THERE'S A DISTRUST THAT STEMS 
FROM THE FACT AND I HAVE HAD 
CONVERSATIONS WITH LEADERS IN 
FACEBOOK ABOUT THE LACK OF 
DIVERSITY IN THE TECH SECTOR AS 
WELL, PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING 
THESE ALGORITHMS, PEOPLE WHO 
ARE ACTUALLY POLICING FOR THIS 
DATA, POLICING FOR THESE 
PROBLEMS. 
ARE THEY GOING TO BE A PART OF 
A MORE DIVERSE GROUP THAT'S 
LOOKING AT THIS? 
YOU'RE LOOKING TO HIRE, AS YOU 
SAID, 5,000 NEW POSITIONS FOR 
AMONG OTHER THINGS REVIEWING 
CONTENT, BUT WE KNOW IN YOUR 
INDUSTRY THE INCLUSIVE 
INCLUSIVENESS, IT'S A REALLY 
PROBLEM -- INCLUSIVENESS, IT'S 
A REAL PROBLEM, NOT JUST WITH 
FACEBOOK BUT IN THE TECH AREA. 
WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS A 
MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND 
I'M WONDERING IF YOU'D BE OPEN 
TO OPENING YOUR PLATFORM FOR 
CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS TO 
REALLY AUDIT A LOT OF THESE 
COMPANIES DEALING IN AREAS OF 
CREDIT AND HOUSING TO REALLY 
AUDIT WHAT IS ACTUALLY 
HAPPENING AND BETTER HAVE MORE 
TRANSPARENCY IN WORKING WITH 
YOUR PLATFORM? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT'S A 
VERY GOOD IDEA AND I THINK WE 
SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON THE DETAILS 
OF THAT. 
>> I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT 
THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION, 
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY 
DISTURBING TO ME IS THE FACT 
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT 
USE FACEBOOK'S PLATFORM TO 
SURVEIL AFRICAN AMERICAN 
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE BLACK LIVES 
MATTER. 
I KNOW YOU'VE EXPRESSED SUPPORT 
FOR THE GROUP AND IF I PHILANDO 
CASTILE'S KILLING WAS LIVE ON 
FACEBOOK. 
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE 
COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING AND 
INSURING THAT THE FREEDOMS THAT 
CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AND 
OTHERS ARE NOT TARGETS OR THEIR 
WORK NOT BEING UNDERMINED OR 
PEOPLE NOT USING YOUR PLATFORM 
TO UNFAIRLY SURVEIL AND TRY TO 
UNDERMINE THE ACTIVITIES THOSE 
GROUPS ARE DOING? 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT. 
WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AND IN 
GENERAL UNLESS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
HAS A VERY CLEAR SUBPOENA OR 
ABILITY OR REASON TO GET ACCESS 
TO INFORMATION, WE'RE GOING TO 
PUSH BACK ON THAT ACROSS THE 
BOARD. 
>> THEN I'D JUST LIKE FOR THE 
RECORD BECAUSE MY TIME IS 
EXPIRED, BUT THERE'S A LAWSUIT 
AGAINST FACEBOOK ABOUT 
DISCRIMINATION AND YOU MOVED 
FOR THE LAWSUIT TO BE DISMISSED 
BECAUSE NO HARM WAS SHOWN. 
COULD YOU PLEASE SUBMIT TO THE 
RECORD, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT 
PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE NOT 
RECRUITED FOR VARIOUS ECONOMIC 
OPPORTUNITIES OR BEING HARMED, 
CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY WHY YOU 
MOVED TO DISMISS THAT LAWSUIT 
FOR THE RECORD? 
>> SENATOR HELLER IS UP NEXT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU, 
APPRECIATE THE TIME AND THANK 
YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME. 
I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY AND 
I THINK YOU'RE AT THE FINAL 
STRETCH HERE, BUT I'M GLAD THAT 
YOU ARE HERE. 
YESTERDAY FACEBOOK SENT OUT A 
NOTIFICATION TO 87 MILLION 
USERS THAT INFORMATION WAS 
GIVEN TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. 
MY DAUGHTER WAS ONE OF THE 87 
MILLION AND SIX OF MY STAFF ALL 
FROM NEVADA RECEIVED THIS 
NOTIFICATION. 
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY 
NEVADANS WERE AMONG THE 87 
MILLION THAT RECEIVED THIS 
NOTIFICATION? 
>> SENATOR, I DON'T HAVE THIS 
BROKEN OUT BY STATE RIGHT NOW, 
BUT I CAN HAVE MY TEAM FOLLOW 
UP WITH YOU TO GET YOU THE 
INFORMATION. 
>> OKAY. 
I FIGURED THAT WOULD BE THE 
ANSWER. 
IF AFTER HEARING THIS, GOING 
THROUGH THIS HEARING AND 
NEVADANS NO LONGER WANT TO HAVE 
A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT, IF THAT'S 
THE CASE, IF A FACEBOOK USER 
DELETES THEIR ACCOUNT, DO YOU 
DELETE THEIR DATA? 
>> YES. 
>> MY KIDS HAVE BEEN ON 
FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM FOR YEARS. 
HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP A USER'S 
DATA? 
>> I'M SORRY. 
CAN YOU -- 
>> HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP A 
USER'S DATAAFTER THEY'VE LEFT? 
IF THEY CHOOSE TO DELETE THEIR 
ACCOUNT, HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP 
THEIR DATA? 
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 
THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. 
I KNOW WE TRY TO DELETE IT AS 
QUICKLY AS IS REASONABLE. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPLEX 
SYSTEMS AND IT TAKES A WHILE TO 
WORK THROUGH ALL THAT, BUT I 
THINK WE TRY TO MOVE AS QUICKLY 
AS POSSIBLE. 
I CAN FOLLOW UP OR HAVE MY TEAM 
FOLLOW UP TO GET YOU THE DATA 
ON THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
HAVE YOU EVER SAID THAT YOU 
WON'T SELL AN AD BASED ON 
PERSONAL INFORMATION, SIMPLY 
THAT YOU WOULDN'T SELL THIS 
DATA BECAUSE OF THE USAGE OF IT 
GOES TOO FAR? 
>> SENATOR, COULD YOU CLARIFY 
THAT? 
>> HAVE YOU EVER DRAWN THE LINE 
ON SELLING DATA TO AN 
ADVERTISER? 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
WE DON'T SELL DATA AT ALL. 
THE WAY THE AD SYSTEM WORKS IS 
ADVERTISERS CAN COME TO US AND 
SAY I HAVE A MESSAGE THAT I'M 
TRYING TO REACH A CERTAIN TYPE 
OF PEOPLE. 
THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN 
SOMETHING.  
THEY MIGHT LIVE IN A PLACE AND 
THEN WE HELP THEM GET THAT 
MESSAGE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE, BUT 
THIS IS ONE OF THE -- IT'S 
WIDELY MISCHARACTERIZED ABOUT 
OUR SYSTEM THAT WE SELL DATA 
AND IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF MOST 
IMPORTANT PARTS OF HOW FACEBOOK 
WORKS IS WE DO NOT SELL DATA. 
ADVERTISERS DO NOT GET ACCESS 
TO PEOPLE'S INDIVIDUAL DATA. 
>> HAVE YOU EVER COLLECTED THE 
CONTENT OF PHONE CALLS OR 
MESSAGES THROUGH ANY FACEBOOK 
APPLICATION OR SERVICE? 
>> SENATOR, I DON'T BELIEVE 
WE'VE EVER COLLECTED THE 
CONTENT OF PHONE CALLS. 
WE HAVE AN APP CALLED MESSENGER 
THEIR -- MOST OF THEIR FACEBOOK 
FRIENDS AND WE DO ON THE 
ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM ALLOW 
PEOPLE TO USE THAT APP AS THEIR 
CLIENT FOR BOTH FACEBOOK 
MESSAGES AND TEXTS. 
SO WE DO ALLOW PEOPLE TO IMPORT 
THEIR TEXTS INTO THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT GOVERNMENT 
SURVEILLANCE. 
FOR YEARS FACEBOOK SAID THAT 
THERE SHOULD BE STRICT LIMITS 
ON THE INFORMATN THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN ACCESS ON 
AMERICANS AND BY THE WAY, I 
AGREED WITH YOU THAT BECAUSE 
PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO 
NEVADANS. 
YOU ARGUE THAT FACEBOOK USERS 
WOULDN'T TRUST YOU IF THEY 
THOUGHT YOU WERE GIVING THEIR 
PRIVATE INFORMATION TO THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, YET YOU 
USE AND SELL THE SAME DATA TO 
MAKE MONEY AND IN THE CASE OF 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA YOU DON'T 
EVEN KNOW HOW IT'S USED AFTER 
YOU SELL IT. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHY THIS ISN'T 
HYPOCRITICAL? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, ONCE AGAIN WE 
DON'T SELL ANY DATA TO ANYONE. 
WE DON'T SELL IT TO ADVERTISERS 
AND WE DON'T SELL IT TO 
DEVELOPERS. 
WHAT WE DO ALLOW IS FOR PEOPLE 
TO SIGN INTO APPS AND BRING 
THEIR DATA AND IT USED TO BE 
THE DATA OF SOME OF THEIR 
FRIEND, BUT NOW IT ISN'T WITH 
THEM AND THAT I THINK MAKE 
SENSE. 
THAT'S BASIC DATA PORTABILITY, 
THE ABILITY THAT YOU OWN THE 
DATA. 
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE IT 
FROM ONE APP TO ANOTHER IF 
YOU'D LIKE. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE MORE 
RESPONSIBLE WITH MILLION OF 
AMERICANS' PERSONAL DATA THAN 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD 
BE? 
>> YES. 
BUT, SENATOR, YOUR POINT ABOUT 
SURVEILLANCE, I THINK THAT 
THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT 
DISTINCTION TO DRAW HERE, WHICH 
IS THAT WHEN ORGANIZATIONS DO 
SURVEILLANCE, PEOPLE DON'T HAVE 
CONTROL OVER THAT. 
ON FACEBOOK EVERYTHING THAT YOU 
SHARE THERE, YOU HAVE CONTROL 
OVER. 
YOU CAN SAY I DON'T WANT THIS 
INFORMATION TO BE THERE. 
YOU HAVE FULL ACCESS TO 
UNDERSTAND EVERY PIECE OF 
INFORMATION THAT FACEBOOK MIGHT 
KNOW ABOUT YOU AND YOU CAN GET 
RID OF ALL OF IT AND I DON'T 
KNOW OF ANY SURVEILLANCE 
ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD THAT 
OPERATES THAT WAY, WHICH IS WHY 
I THINK THAT THAT COMPARISON 
JUST ISN'T REALLY APT HERE. 
>> WITH YOU HERE TODAY DO YOU 
THINK YOU'RE A VICTIM? 
>> NO. 
>> DO YOU THINK FACEBOOK AS A 
COMPANY IS A VICTIM? 
>> SENATOR, NO. 
I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBLE 
TO PROTECT EVERYONE IN OUR 
COMMUNITY FROM -- 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 
EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY FROM 
ANYONE IN OUR ECOSYSTEM WHO IS 
GOING TO POTENTIALLY HARM THEM 
AND I THINK WE HAVEN'T DONE 
ENOUGH HISTORICALLY AND WE NEED 
TO STEP UP AND DO MORE. 
>> DO YOU CONSIDER THE 87 
MILLION USERS VICTIMS? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK YES. 
I MEAN THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR 
INFORMATION TO BE SOLD TO 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA BY A 
DEVELOPER AND THAT HAPPENED AND 
IT HAPPENED ON OUR WATCH. 
SO EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T DO IT, 
I THINK WE HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO 
PREVENT THAT AND BE ABLE TO 
TAKE ACTION SOONER AND WE'RE 
COMMITTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
DO THAT GOING FORWARD, WHICH IS 
WHY THE STEPS THAT I ANNOUNCED 
BEFORE ARE NOW -- THE TWO MOST 
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE'RE 
DOING ARE LOCKING DOWN THE 
PLATFORM TO MAKE SURE 
DEVELOPERS CAN'T GET ACCESS TO 
THAT MUCH DATA SO THIS CAN'T 
HAPPEN AGAIN GOING FORWARD, 
WHICH I THINK IS LARGELY THE 
CASE SINCE 2014, AND GOING 
BACKWARDS WE NEED TO 
INVESTIGATION EVERY SINGLE APP 
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD ACCESS TO A 
LARGE ALL OF PEOPLE'S DATA TO 
MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE WAS 
MISUSING IT. 
IF WE FIND THEY ARE, WE'RE 
GOING TO GET INTO THEIR 
SYSTMS, DO A FULL AUDIT, MAKE 
SURE THEY DELETE IT AND TELL 
EVERYONE WHO IS AFFECTED. 
>> WE'LL GO TO SENATOR PETERS 
AND THEN INTO THE BREAK AND 
SENATOR TILLIS COMING OUT OF 
THE BREAK. 
SO, SENATOR PETERS. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANK YOU FOR 
BEING HERE TODAY. 
YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR VERY 
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS IN STARTING 
FACEBOOK IN YOUR DORM ROOM, 
WHICH I APPRECIATED THAT STORY, 
BUT CERTAINLY FACEBOOK HAS 
CHANGED AN AWFUL LOT OVER A 
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF 
TIME. 
WHEN FACEBOOK LAUNCHED ITS 
TIMELINE FEATURE, CONSUMERS SAW 
THEIR FRIENDS POST 
CHRONOLOGICALLY WAS THE 
PROCESS, BUT FACEBOOK HAS SINCE 
THEN CHANGED TO A TIMELINE 
DRIVEN BY SOME VERY 
SOPHISTICATED ALGORITHMS AND I 
THINK IT HAS LEFT MANY PEOPLE 
AS A RESULT OF THAT ASKING WHY 
AM I SEEING THIS FEED AND WHY 
AM I SEEING THIS RIGHT NOW? 
NOW IN LIGHT OF THE CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA ISSUE FACEBOOK USERS 
ARE ASKING I THINK SOME NEW 
QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. 
CAN I BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING 
AND WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS 
INFORMATION ABOUT ME? 
SO I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY 
VERY SIMPLY THAT FACEBOOK IS 
LOSING THE TRUST OF AN AWFUL 
LOT OF AMERICANS AS A RESULT OF 
THIS INCIDENT. 
AND I THINK AN EXAMPLE OF THIS 
IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN 
HEARING A LOT FROM FOLKS WHO 
HAVE BEEN COMING UP TO ME AND 
TALKING ABOUT REALLY KIND OF AN 
EXPERIENCE THEY'VE HAD WHERE 
THEY'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION 
WITH FRIENDS, NOT ON THE PHONE, 
JUST TALKING, AND THEN THEY SEE 
ADS POPPING UP FAIRLY QUICKLY 
ON THEIR FACEBOOK. 
SO I'VE HEARD CONSTITUENTS FEAR 
THAT FACEBOOK IS MINING AUDIO 
FROM THEIR MOBILE DEVICES FOR 
THE PURPOSE OF AD TARGETING, 
WHICH I THINK SPEAKS TO THIS 
LACK OF TRUST THAT WE'RE SEEING 
HERE. 
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME 
TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICAL ISSUES 
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, BUT FOR THE 
RECORD, I THINK IT'S CLEAR AS I 
HEAR IT ALL THE TIME INCLUDING 
FROM MY OWN STAFF. 
YES OR NO, DOES FACEBOOK USE 
AUDIO OBTAINED FROM MOBILE 
DEVICES TO ENRICH PERSONAL 
INFORMATION ABOUT ITS USERS? 
>> NO. 
>> THE -- 
>> WELL, SENATOR, LET ME BE 
CLEAR ON THIS. 
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS 
CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT GETS 
PASSED AROUND THAT WE LISTEN TO 
WHAT'S GOING ON ON YOUR 
MICROPHONE AND USE THAT FOR 
ADS. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WE DON'T DO THAT. 
TO BE CLEAR, WE DO ALLOW PEOPLE 
TO TAKE VIDEOS ON THEIR DEVICES 
AND SHARE THOSE AND, OF COURSE, 
VIDEOS ALSO HAVE AUDIOS, SO WE 
DO WHILE YOU'RE TAKING THE 
VIDEO RECORD THAT AND USE THAT 
TO MAKE THE SERVICE BETTER BY 
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR VIDEOS 
HAVE AUDIO, BUT I MEAN THAT I 
THINK IS PRETTY CLEAR, BUT I 
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS 
EXHAUSTIVE THERE. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL DISPEL A 
LOT OF WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING. 
SO THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. 
CERTAINLY TODAY IN THE ERA OF 
MEGA DATA WE ARE FINDING THAT 
DATA DRIVES EVERYTHING 
INCLUDING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. 
CONSUMER INFORMATION IS 
PROBABLY THE MOST VALUABLE 
INFORMATION YOU CAN GET IN THE 
DATA ECOSYSTEM AND AS YOU'VE 
MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY, 
PEOPLE LIKE THE FACT THEY CAN 
HAVE TARGETED ADS THEY'LL BE 
INTERESTED IN AS OPPOSED TO 
BEING BOMBARDED BY ADS THEY 
HAVE NO INTEREST IN AND THAT 
CONSUMER INFORMATION IS 
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO TAILOR 
THAT, BUT PEOPLE ARE NOW 
BEGINNING TO WONDER IS THERE AN 
EXPENSE TO THAT? 
WHEN IT COMES TO PERHAPS 
EXPOSING THEM TO BEING 
MANIPULATED OR THROUGH 
DECEPTION. 
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE MANY TIMES DURING 
YOUR TESTIMONY AND I KNOW 
YOU'VE EMPLOYED SOME NEW 
ALGORITHMS TO TARGET BOTS, 
BRING DOWN FAKE ACCOUNTS, 
DEALING WITH TERRORISM, BUT YOU 
ALSO KNOW AI IS NOT WITHOUT 
RISK IN THAT YOU HAVE TO BE 
VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW 
THOSE ALGORITHMS ARE 
CONSTRUCTED. 
HOW DO YOU SEE ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE, MORE 
SPECIFICALLY, DEALING  WITH THE 
ECOSYSTEM BY HELPING TO GET 
CONSUMER INSIGHTS, BUT ALSO 
KEEPING CONSUMER PRIVACY SAFE? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THE CORE 
QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT AI 
TRANSPARENCY IS A REALLY 
IMPORTANT ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE 
JUST STARTING TO VERY SERIOUSLY 
STUDY AND THAT'S RAMPING UP A 
LOT. 
I THINK THIS WILL BE A VERY 
CENTRAL QUESTION FOR HOW WE 
THINK ABOUT AI SYSTEMS OVER THE 
NEXT DECADE AND BEYOND. 
RIGHT NOW A LOT OF OUR AI 
SYSTEMS MAKE DECISIONS IN WAYS 
THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY 
UNDERSTAND. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> AND I DON'T THINK THAT IN 10 
OR 20 YEARS IN THE FUTURE THAT 
WE ALL WANT TO BUILD WE WANT TO 
END UP WITH SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE 
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE 
MAKING DECISIONS. 
SO DOING THE RESEARCH NOW TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THESE SYSTEMS 
CAN HAVE THOSE PRINCIPLES AS 
WE'RE DEVELOPING THEM I THINK 
IS CERTAINLY AN EXTREMELY 
IMPORTANT THING. 
>> YOU BRING UP THE PRINCIPALS 
BECAUSE AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE, 
AI SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY IN VERY 
COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS WHEN YOU 
HAVE MACHINE LEARNING, IT'S 
SOMETIMES WE DIFFICULT TO 
UNDERSTAND AS YOU MENTIONED 
EXACTLY HOW THESE DECISIONS 
WERE ARRIVED AT. 
THERE'S EXAMPLES HOW ZIGS WERE 
MADE ON A DISCRIMINATORY BASIS 
AND THEY CAN COMPOUND IF YOU'RE 
NOT VERY CAREFUL HOW THAT  
OCCURS. 
YOU MENTIONED PRINCIPLES. 
IS YOUR COMPANY DEVELOPING A 
SET OF PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE THAT 
DEVELOPMENT AND WOULD YOU GIVE 
DETAILS AS TO HOW THEY WILL 
HELP DEVELOP THE ISSUE? 
>> YES. 
I CAN FOLLOW UP AND GET YOU 
INFORMATION ON THAT. 
WE HAVE A WHOLE AI ETHICS TEAM 
THAT IS WORKING ON DEVELOPING 
BASICALLY THE TECHNOLOGY. 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT 
PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLES. 
IT'S ALSO A TECHNOLOGICAL 
FOUNDATION FOR MAKING SURE THIS 
GOES IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE 
WANT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR PETERS. 
WE'LL RECESS FOR FIVE AND COME 
BACK IN. 
SO WE'LL GIVE MR. ZUCKERBERG A 
QUICK BREAK HERE. 
THANKS. 
>> WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG 
ANSWER SENATORS' QUESTIONS 
MOSTLY REFERRING TO THE 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA DATA 
BREACH, BUT MANY, MANY OTHER 
QUESTIONS WERE POSED REGARDING 
ISSUES ALL ACROSS THE TECH 
SECTOR. 
I WANT TO BRING BACK OUR PANEL 
NOW, DAN PATTERSON, A SENIOR 
WRITER FOR TECH REPUBLIC. 
JENNIFER GRIGEL IS AN ASSISTANT 
PROFESSOR OF COMMUNICATIONS AT 
SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY NEW SCHOOL 
OF PUBLIC COMMUNICTIONS AND 
ROGER CHANG, EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
OF CNET NEWS. 
GUYS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR 
STICKING WITH US, MARATHON 
AFTERNOON. 
THERE WERE SOME RECURRING 
THEMES WE KEEP HEARING COMING 
UP. 
ROGER, ONE OF THOSE THEMES IS 
AI, HOW AI SEEMS TO BE THE 
PANACEA THAT ZUCKERBERG IS 
POINTING TO THAT WILL SOLVE SO 
MANUFACTURE THESE ILLS, BUT 
HE'S NOT -- SO MANY OF THESE 
HIS, BUT HE'S NOT BEING 
SPECIFIC. 
>> HE'S THROWN AROUND THE TERM 
AI AS A SOLUTION FOR 
EVERYTHING. 
HE HASN'T BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT 
WHAT KIND OF AI, HOW IT WOULD 
WORK AND HASN'T REALLY TALKED 
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF AI. 
I BRING UP THE EXAMPLE OF 
MICROSOFT'S CHAT BOT THAT CAME 
OUT A FEW YEARS AGO. 
IT ONLY TOOK 24 HOURS BEFORE 
THAT FRIENDLY CHAT BOT BECAME 
THIS CRAZY RACIST PERSONALITY, 
WENT FROM EVERYTHING IS GREAT 
TO HITLER WAS RIGHT. 
>> SO AI LEARNS WHAT YOU FEED 
IT. 
IF YOU FEED IT THE WRONG THING 
EVEN ONCE, IT CAN CAUSE 
DISASTROUS RESULTS. 
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DAN? 
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
AI AND ALMOST EVERY EXPERT WE 
SPEAK TO AT TECH REPUBLIC URGES 
AGAINST USING AI BECAUSE THE 
WAY IT LEARNS HAS A LOT TO DO 
WITH THE VALUES AND THE WAY 
THAT YOU CODE. 
THAT'S ONE REASON ELON MUSK 
WARNS ABOUT ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE AND USING IT AS A 
CATCH ALL FOR ALL CYBER 
SECURITY PROBLEMS IS SIMPLY NOT 
AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. 
>> RIGHT. 
JENNIFER, IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MUCH 
OF THE SECURITY PROBLEMS GOING 
FORWARD WILL BE FIXED BY AI OR 
BY ACTUAL HUMAN BEINGS THAT 
HAVE YET TO BE HIRED, CORRECT? 
>> I'VE SAID FOR A WHILE WE 
NEED WAY MORE HUMAN BEINGS 
BEHIND THESE PLATFORMS. 
I THINK EVERY TIME THEY GO INTO 
A CRISIS THEY SAY OH, WE HIRED 
A COUPLE THOUSAND MORE HUMANS. 
SO WE'RE SEEING THAT JUST NOW 
WITH 20,000 FACEBOOK IS 
REPORTING BY THE END OF THE 
YEAR, BUT WE HAVE 2 BILLION 
USERS THERE. 
20,000 CONTENT MODERATORS? 
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. 
>> A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE 
NEEDED. 
ANOTHER THING THAT ZUCKERBERG 
MENTIONED ALMOST FOUR TIMES BY 
MY DOWN, PERHAPS MORE, TALKED 
ABOUT THIS BEING A -- COUNT, 
PERHAPS MORE, TALKED ABOUT THIS 
BEING A COMPANY I STARTED WAY 
BACK IN MY DORM ROOM, AW 
SHUCKS, IT GOT AWAY FROM ME 
AND, JEN, YOU MENTIONED HE'S 
KIND OF FALLING BACK ON 
HARVARD. 
>> HE'S KIND OF RELYING ON 
THAT. 
HE WAS GIVEN AN HONORARY DEGREE 
A FEW YEARS AGO EVEN THOUGH HE 
DIDN'T COMPLETE HIS STUDIES 
THERE, BUT HE'S KIND OF THE 
POSTER CHILD OF SUCCESSFUL. 
>> HE'S BEEN FORGIVEN FOR THAT 
AT THIS POINT. 
>> I THINK HE'S RELYING ON HIS 
LEGACY THERE AND THE 
INSTITUTIONAL CONNECTION HE'S 
TRYING TO ASSIMILATE WITH 
HARVARD TO BUILD THIS INTO HIS  
PERSONA. 
I'M SMART. 
I CAN BE TRUSSED. 
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST 
-- TRUSTED. 
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST 
AMERICAN STORIES. 
THEY'RE ALL SENSITIVE TO THAT 
FACT THIS IS AN AMERICAN 
COMPANY. 
>> THEY'RE ALL GOING TO COLLEGE 
AND SAYING I WANT MY KID TO 
COME UP WITH FACEBOOK IN THEIR 
DORM ROOM. 
ANOTHER THEME THAT KEPT COMING 
UP WAS THIS OPT IN VERSUS OPT 
OUT MODEL. 
EUROPE ADOPTED THE OPT IN 
MODEL. 
YOU HAVE TO ACTIVELY OPT IN TO 
HAVE YOUR DATA SHARED. 
HE WAS ASKED BY SEVERAL 
SENATORS IF HE WOULD SUPPORT 
SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN THE U.S. 
DAN, WE ALMOST GOT HIM TO SAY 
YES AT ONE POINT, CORRECT? 
>> WELL, I THINK HE KIND OF 
KNOWS WHEN WOULD BE A SAFER 
SOLUTION FOR THE VAST MAJORITY 
OF HIS 2 BILLION USERS, BUT, OF 
COURSE, OPT IN IS NOT -- IT 
DOESN'T HELP THE SHARE PRICE GO 
UP AND REALLY OPT IN COULD BE 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD INHIBIT 
THE GROWTH OF A SOCIAL NETWORK.
WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT FASTER 
NOTIFICATIONS AND FASTER 
COMMENTS. 
AN OPT IN MIGHT BE MORE PASSIVE 
AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING YOU'D 
ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN. 
>> AT THE END HE SAID I LOOK 
FORWARD TO KNOW ITING THIS 
CONVERSATION WITH MY TEAM -- TO 
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH 
MY TEAM. 
>> THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF 
CAVEATS AND A LOT OF PUTS AND 
TAKES WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT 
THIS WILL LOOK LIKE ACTUALLY. 
>> I WANT TO PLAY, WHEN WE CAN 
BRING IT UP, THE SOUND FROM I 
THOUGHT ONE OF THE MORE 
HUMOROUS EXCHANGES WHEN SENATOR 
DURBIN ASKED IF HE WOULD BE 
WILLING TO SHARE INFORMATION ON 
THE HOTEL HE STALED IN LAST 
NIGHT AND WHO HE WAS 
MESSENGERING THIS AFTERNOON AND 
HE LOOKED SURPRISED AND SAID 
NO. 
>> WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE 
SHARING WITH US THE NAME OF THE 
HOTEL YOU STAYED IN LAST NIGHT? 
>> NO. 
>> IF YOU'VE MESSAGED ANYBODY 
WITH US THIS WEEK, WOULD YOU 
SHARE WITH US THE NAMES OF THE 
PEOPLE YOU MESSAGED? 
>> SENATOR, NO, I WOULD 
PROBABLY NOT CHOOSE TO DO THAT 
PUBLICLY HERE. 
>> I THINK THAT MIGHT WHAT 
ABOUT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, YOUR 
RIGHT TO PRIVACY, THE LIMITS OF 
YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND HOW 
MUCH YOU GIVE AWAY IN MODERN 
AMERICA IN THE NAME OF 
"CONNECTING PEOPLE AROUND THE 
WORLD." 
THE QUESTION BASICALLY OF WHAT 
INFORMATION FACEBOOK'S 
CHECKING, WHO THEY'RE SENDING 
IT TO AND WHETHER THEY WERE 
ASKING IN ADVANCE MY PERMISSION 
TO DO THAT. 
IS THAT A FAIR THING FOR A USER 
OF FACEBOOK TO EXPECT? 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE 
CONTROL OVER HOW THEIR 
INFORMATION IS USED AND AS 
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN SOME OF 
THE OTHER QUESTIONS, I THINK 
THAT THAT IS LAID OUT IN SOME 
OF THE DOCUMENTS, BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY, YOU WANT TO GIVE 
PEOPLE CONTROL IN THE PRODUCT 
ITSELF. 
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT WAY THAT 
THIS HAPPENS ACROSS OUR 
SERVICES IS THAT EVERY DAY 
PEOPLE COME TO OUR SERVICES TO 
CHOOSE TO SHARE PHOTOS OR SEND 
MESSAGES AND EVERY SINGLE TIME 
THEY CHOOSE TO SHARE SOMETHING 
THEY HAVE A CONTROL RIGHT THERE 
ABOUT WHO THEY WANT TO SHARE IT 
WITH. 
>> SEEMS SENATOR DURBIN CAUGHT 
HIM A LITTLE OFF GUARD THERE. 
HIS PR TEAM DIDN'T PREPARE HIM 
FOR THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION 
WHICH PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE FIRST ONE THEY TOLD HIM TO 
BE PREPARED FOR. 
>> YOU CAN ALMOST SEE A GIVE OF 
STAR WARS AND ADMIRAL AKBAR 
GOING IT'S A TRAP! 
>> ASIDE FROM THAT QUESTION -- 
A GIFF OF STAR WARS AND ADMIRAL 
AKBAR GOING IT'S A TRAP! 
>> I THINK ANY TIME THERE WAS A 
SLIGHT MISWORDING OF A QUESTION 
HE POUNCED ON IT. 
HE KEPT ASKING FOR 
CLARIFICATION. 
HE KIND OF SAID I DIDN'T 
UNDERSTAND. 
COULD YOU CLARIFY. 
COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION 
AND REALLY FORCED SOME OF THE 
SENATORS TO STUMBLE UPON WHAT 
THEY WERE ASKING. 
>> A COUPLE TIMES I ALMOST FELT 
HE WAS WILLFULLY PLAYING DUMB, 
FOR INSTANCE, WHEN HE WAS ASKED 
ABOUT THE EXACT NUMBER OF DATA 
POINTS FACEBOOK COLLECTS, WHAT 
CATEGORIES OF DATA POINTS. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS CLEAR WHAT THE 
SENATOR WAS ASKING, BUT HE WAS 
SIDESTEPPING THE ISSUE AND 
ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON 
POST, FACEBOOK DOES COLLECT A 
LARGE NUMBER OF INFORMATION 
INCLUDING THING LIKE THE SQUARE 
FOOTAGE OF YOUR HOME, RIGHT? 
THOSE ARE DATA POINTS. 
WE ARE GOING TO BRING IN CBS 
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ED O'KEEFE 
FROM WASHINGTON. 
WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR TAKE-AWAY 
FROM THIS HEARING TODAY? 
>> Reporter:  I THINK IT'S 
INTERESTING, TANYA, BECAUSE IF 
YOU WERE SOMEONE WHO MAYBE 
DOESN'T ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND HOW 
FACEBOOK WORKS, YOU'VE 
CERTAINLY GOTTEN A TUTORIAL ON 
THAT AND FREQUENT REMINDERS 
FROM ZUCKERBERG ABOUT WHAT IT 
IS YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO AND 
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN OPT OUT 
OR DECIDE NOT TO SHARE CERTAIN 
THINGS AND HE'S DONE THAT 
SOMEWHAT REPEATEDLY BUT PERHAPS 
NOT AS CLEARLY AS SOME OF OTHER 
THINGS HE WAS TRYING TO SAY. 
I THINK HE'S PERHAPS LOST AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO REMIND FOLKS 
YEAH, USERS MAY BE VICTIMS AS 
SENATOR DEAN HELLER SUGGESTED 
TO HIM, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A 
CHOICE HERE EXACTLY HOW MUCH 
THEY WANT TO SHARE. 
THE OTHER THING I'M SURE IS 
FRUSTRATING TO SOME IS WE'VE 
GOTTEN NO REAL SENSE FROM HIM 
AT LEAST PUBLICLY HERE ON THE 
RECORD OF WHAT HE THINKS 
úCONGR 
IN RESPONSE. 
THIS WHOLE WE'LL GET MY STAFF 
TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT, 
THAT GOES NOWHERE. 
IF YOU WERE SOMEBODY HOPING HE 
WOULD CLARIFY WHAT HE THINKS 
AND WHAT OTHERS IN SILICON 
VALLEY MIGHT THINK SHOULD BE 
DONE, IT'S NOT HAPPENING. 
THAT'S UNDOUBTEDLY ON THE 
ADVICE OF THE FOLKS THAT 
PREPARED HIM FOR THAT THAT YOU 
DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THE 
RABBIT HOLE OF GETTING TOO 
SPECIFIC BECAUSE IT MAY TURN 
OUT WHAT YOU WERE THINKING OF 
THAT DAY ISN'T WHAT IS PASSED 
OR DOESN'T ULTIMATELY MAKE 
SENSE. 
IT'S BEEN INTERESTING. 
I THINK IT POINT OUT SOME OF 
THE GENERATIONAL AND 
TECHNOLOGICAL DIVIDES WHICH 
EXISTS BETWEEN SOME MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS AND MR. ZUCKERBERG, 
BUT IN SOME WAYS THOSE 
LAWMAKERS ARE REFLECTIVE OF 
PROBABLY A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF 
FACEBOOK USERS WHO DON'T 
ENTIRELY COMPREHEND WHAT THEY 
ARE PART OF. 
>> DAN, ONE THING I DIDN'T 
THINK WAS SATISFACTORILY 
ANSWERED TODAY WAS WHAT NOW 
HAPPENS TO ALL THE INFORMATION 
OUT THERE? 
IT DOESN'T GET CLAWED BACK. 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA MAY OR MAY 
NOT HAVE IT. 
WHERE IS IT? 
FACEBOOK CAN DO WHATEVER IT 
WANTS GOING FORWARD, BUT 
THERE'S STILL MILLIONS AND 
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO FEEL 
LIKE THEIR DATA IS OUT THERE. 
>> YEAH. 
AND HE HAS NOT NECESSARILY 
GIVEN A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT. 
THE OTHER THING I THOUGHT WAS 
INTERESTING WAS WE HAD A FEW 
QUESTIONS ABOUT CONTENT AND WHO 
WAS SHARING THAT, SPECIFICALLY 
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS OR THOUGHTS 
POLICE AND THINGS NOT DONE TO 
STOP HATE SPEECH IN TERM OF 
OTHERS. 
IT'S TELLING TO -- TERMS OF 
OTHERS. 
IT'S TELLING TO ME THAT IT'S 
COMING FROM SENATORS LIKE TED 
CRUZ AND BEN SASSE, REPUBLICANS 
FROM TEXAS AND NEBRASKA AND 
CORY BOOKER, DEMOCRAT FROM NEW 
JERSEY, WHO FRANKLY HAVE 
BROADER POLITICAL AMBITIONS AND 
ARE PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT 
2020 OR BEYOND AND KNOW THAT BY 
BRINGING THIS UP AND RAISING 
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW CERTAIN 
POLITICAL SPEECH IS HANDLED ON 
FACEBOOK, THEY MAY BE SCORING 
POINT WITH THEIR PARTY BASE. 
IT'S INTERESTING A FEW SENATORS 
THROUGHOUT THIS HAVE AT LEAST 
TAKEN AN OPPORTUNITY THERE TO 
DEFEND SOME MEMBERS OF THEIR 
IDEOLOGICAL FLANKS AND USE IT 
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF 
HIT ZUCKERBERG WITH THAT, BUT 
AGAIN VERY FEW DETAILS 
OTHERWISE ON WHAT EXACTLY 
CONGRESS MIGHT DO NECK AND WHAT 
FACEBOOK IS WILLING TO -- NEXT 
AND WHAT FACEBOOK IS WILLING TO 
DO WITH THEM TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. 
>> ED O'KEEFE, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE 
MEMBERS OF OUR PANEL. 
THAT WAS A MARATHON SESSION AND 
YOU GUYS WERE GREAT TO STICK 
WITH US. 
WE REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE 
YOUR TIME. 
WE WILL CHECK BACK IN WITH THE 
HEARING WHEN IT RESUMES. 
>>> NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 
STORMY DANIELS SAGA, CBS NEWS 
HAS LEARNED SHE IS COOPERATING  
WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
INVESTIGATORS. 
THEY ARE LOOKING INTO HER 
NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT AND A 
$130,000 PAYMENT FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S PERSONAL LAWYER MICHAEL 
COHEN. 
THIS COMES AFTER FBI AGENTS 
RAIDED COHEN'S OFFICE, HOME AND 
HOTEL ROOM AS PART OF THEIR 
PROBE. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED IT A 
WITCH HUNT. 
WE'LL HAVE MORE NEWS AFTER A 
QUICK BREAK. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN, ALWAYS 
ON. 
>>> WE'RE GOING BACK INTO THAT 
HEARING WITH FACEBOOK CEO MARK 
ZUCKERBERG TESTIFYING BEFORE 
SENATORS. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN PROUDLY 
TWEETED FACEBOOK WAS SURPRISED 
WE WERE ABLE TO SUCK OUT THE 
WHOLE SOCIAL GRAPH, BUT THEY 
DIDN'T STOP US ONCE THEY 
REALIZED THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE 
DOING. 
SO YOU CLEARLY HAD SOME PEOPLE 
IN YOUR EMPLOY THAT APPARENTLY 
KNEW IT. 
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THIS 
PERSON SAID ON TWITTER AND 
THANK GOODNESS FOR WAY BACK AND 
SOME OF THE OTHER HISTORY GRAB 
ERMA SHEENS. 
I'M SURE WE CAN -- GRABBER 
MACHINES. 
I THINK WE CAN GO BACK AND GET 
IT IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT. 
I WORKED IN DATA ANALYTICS 
PRACTICE A GOOD PART OF MY 
CAREER AND FOR ANYBODY TO 
PRETEND CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WAS 
THE FIRST PERSON TO EXPLOIT 
DATA CLEARLY HASN'T WORKED IN 
THE DATA ANALYTICS FIELD. 
SO WHEN YOU GO BACK AND DO YOUR 
RESEARCH ON CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA, I WOULD PERSONALLY 
APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D START 
BACK FROM THE FIRST KNOWN HIGH 
PROFILE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT 
EXPLOITED FACEBOOK DATA. 
IN FACT, THEY PUBLISHED AN APP 
THAT SAID IT WOULD GRAB 
INFORMATION ABOUT MY FRIENDS, 
THEIR BIRTH DATES, LOCATIONS 
AND LIKES. 
SO PRESUMABLY IF I DOWNLOADED 
THAT APP THAT WAS PUBLISHED BY 
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN, I'VE GOT 
4,900 FRIENDS ON MY FACEBOOK 
PAGE. 
I DELETE THE HATERS AND SAVE 
ROOM FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND 
TRUE FRIENDS ON MY PERSONAL 
PAGE, AS I'M SURE EVERYBODY 
DOES, THEN THAT MEANS IF I 
CLICK JUST ON THAT APP, I WOULD 
HAVE APPROVED THE ACCESS OF 
BIRTH DATES, LOCATIONS AND 
LIKES OF SOME 4,900 PEOPLE 
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. 
SO AS YOU DO THE CHRONOLOGY, I 
THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL 
SO THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY THE 
PARTISAN RHETORIC THAT'S GOING 
ON LIKE THIS IS A REPUBLICAN 
ONLY ISSUE. 
IT'S A BROAD BASED ISSUE THAT 
NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND BAD 
ACTORS AT EITHER END OF THE 
POLITICAL SPECTRUM NEED TO BE 
HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND ILL TRUST 
YOU ALL ARE GOING TO WORK -- 
AND I TRUST YOU ALL ARE GOING 
TO WORK ON THAT. 
I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE 
FACTS. 
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN ANSWER 
ANY OF THE QUESTIONS. 
I'M NOT GOING TO BURDEN YOU 
WITH THAT, BUT I THINK GETTING 
THAT CHRONOLOGY WOULD BE VERY 
HELPFUL. 
THE ONE THING I WOULD ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE TO DO IS GO TO FACEBOOK. 
I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF FACEBOOK. 
I JUST GOT A POST FROM MY 
SISTER OF THIS BEING NATIONAL 
SIBLING DAY, SO I CONNECTED 
WITH FOUR OR FIVE OF MY FAMILY 
WHILE I WAS GIVING MY UNDIVIDED 
ATTENTION, BUT GO TO YOUR  
PRIVACY TAB. 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE 
SOMETHING, DON'T SHARE IT. 
GO ON THERE AND SAY I DON'T 
WANT TO ALLOW THIRD PARTY 
ENGINES TO GET ON MY FACEBOOK 
PAGE. 
GO IN THERE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT 
YOU'RE SIGNING UP FOR. 
IT'S A FREE APP. 
NOW YOU NEED TO BE MORE AND I 
THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. 
I DIDN'T READ YOUR DISCLAIMER 
PAGE OR TERMS OF USE BECAUSE I 
DIDN'T SEE ANYWHERE IN THERE I 
COULD GET AN ATTORNEY AND 
NEGOTIATE THE TERMS. 
I WENT ON AND USED THE PRIVACY 
SETTINGS TO BE AS SAFE AS I 
COULD BE WITH A PRESENCE ON 
FACEBOOK. 
LAST THING, WE TALK ABOUT ALL 
THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION, GOOD 
IDEAS, BUT WHEN YOU WERE 
DEVELOPING THIS APP IN YOUR 
DORM, HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU 
HAVE IN YOUR REGULATORY AFFAIRS 
DIVISION UNTIL EXACTLY. 
SO IF GOVERNMENT TAKES A HEAVY 
HANDED APPROACH TO FIX THIS 
PROBLEM, THEN WE KNOW VERY WELL 
THAT THE NEXT FACEBOOK, THE 
NEXT THING YOU'LL WAKE UP AND 
WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU CONTINUE TO 
BE RELEVANT AS THE BEHEMOTH YOU 
ARE TODAY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING 
TO HAPPEN. 
SO I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A 
PLACE FOR SOME REGULATORY 
GUIDANCE HERE, BUT THERE'S A 
HUGE PLACE FOR GOOGLE, 
SNAPCHAT, TWITTER, ALL THE 
OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO 
GET TOGETHER AND CREATE 
STANDARDS AND I ALSO BELIEVE 
THAT THAT PERSON WHO MAY HAVE 
LOOKED THE OTHER WAY WHEN THE 
WHOLE SOCIAL GRAPH WAS 
EXTRACTED FOR THE OBAMA 
CAMPAIGN IF THEY'RE STILL 
WORKING FOR YOU, THEY PROBABLY 
SHOULDN'T OR AT LEAST THERE 
SHOULD BE A BUSINESS CODE OF 
CONDUCT THAT SAYS YOU DON'T 
PLAY FAVORITES. 
YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE A FAIR 
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE THEIR 
IDEAS. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR TILLIS. 
SENATOR HARRIS. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
I'VE BEEN HERE ON AND OFF THE 
LAST FOUR HOURS THAT YOU'VE 
BEEN TESTIFYING. 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M 
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH 
FACEBOOK VALUES TRUST AND 
TRANSPARENCY. 
IF WE AGREE THAT A CRITICAL 
COMPONENT OF A RELATIONSHIP OF 
TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY IS WE 
SPEAK TRUTH AND WE GET TO THE 
TRUTH. 
DURING THE COURSE OF THIS 
HEARING THE LAST FOUR HOURS 
YOU'VE BEEN ASKED SEVERAL 
CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR WHICH 
YOU DON'T HAVE ANSWERS AND 
THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE INCLUDED 
WHETHER FACEBOOK CAN TRACK 
USERS' BROWSING ACTIVITY EVEN 
AFTER THE USER HAS LOGGED OFF 
OF FACEBOOK, WHETHER FACEBOOK 
CAN TRACK YOUR ACTIVITY ACROSS 
DEVICES EVEN WHEN YOU AREN'T 
LOGGED INTO FACEBOOK, WHO IS 
FACEBOOK'S BIGGEST COMPETITION, 
WHETHER FACEBOOK MAY STORE UP 
TO 96 CATEGORIES OF USERS' 
INFORMATION, WHETHER YOU KNEW 
WHETHER KOGAN'S TERMS OF 
SERVICE AND WHETHER YOU KNEW 
THAT KOGAN COULD SELL OR 
TRANSFER DATA AND THEN ANOTHER 
CASE IN POINT SPECIFICALLY AS 
IT RELATES TO CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA IS AND A CONCERN OF 
MINE IS THAT YOU, MEANING 
FACEBOOK AND I'M GOING TO 
ASSUME YOU PERSONALLY AS CEO, 
BECAME AWARE IN DECEMBER OF 
2015 THAT DR. KOGAN AND 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
MISAPPROPRIATED DATA FROM 87 
MILLION FACEBOOK USERS. 
THAT'S 27 MONTHS AGO THAT YOU 
BECAME AS FACEBOOK AND PERHAPS 
YOU PERSONALLY BECAME AWARE. 
HOWEVER, A DECISION WAS MADE 
NOT TO NOTIFY THE USERS. 
SO MY QUESTION IS DID ANYONE AT 
FACEBOOK HAVE A CONVERSATION AT 
THE TIME THAT YOU BECAME AWARE 
OF THIS BREACH AND HAVE A 
CONVERSATION WHEREIN THE 
DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO 
CONTACT THE USERS? 
>> SENATOR, I DON'T KNOW IF 
THERE WERE ANY CONVERSATIONS ON 
FACEBOOK AT ALL BECAUSE I WAS 
IN A LOT OF THEM. 
>> ON THAT SUBJECT. 
>> I'M NOT SURE WHAT OTHER 
PEOPLE DISCUSSED. 
AT THE TIME IN 2015 WE HEARD 
THE REPORT THAT THIS DEVELOPER, 
ALEKSANDR KOGAN, HAD SOLD DATA 
TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. 
THAT'S IN VIOLATION OF OUR 
TERMS. 
>> CORRECT. 
WERE YOU PART OF A DISCUSSION 
THAT RESULTED IN A DECISION NOT 
TO INFORM YOUR USERS? 
>> I DON'T REMEMBER A 
CONVERSATION LIKE THAT, BUT THE 
REASON WHY -- 
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF ANYONE IN 
LEADERSHIP AT FACEBOOK WHO WAS 
IN A CONVERSATION WHERE A 
DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO INFORM 
YOUR USERS OR DO YOU BELIEVE NO 
SUCH CONVERSATION EVER TOOK 
PLACE? 
>> I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THERE 
WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT, 
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE THOUGHT 
PROCESS AT THE TIME OF THE 
COMPANY, WHICH WAS THAT IN 2015 
WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT THIS, WE 
BANNED THE DEVELOPER AND WE 
DEMANDED THAT THEY DELETE ALL 
THE DATA AND STOP USING IT AND 
THE SAME WITH CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA. 
>> I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY 
IN THAT REGARD, BUT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT NOTIFICATION OF THE USERS 
AND THIS RELATES TO THE ISSUE 
OF TRANSPARENCY AND THE 
RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST, 
INFORMING THE USER ABOUT WHAT 
YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF HOW THEIR 
PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN 
MISUSED AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED 
THAT WHEN YOU PERSONALLY BECAME 
AWARE OF THIS, DID YOU OR 
SENIOR LEADERSHIP DO AN INQUIRY 
TO  FIND OUT WHO AT FACEBOOK 
HAD THIS INFORMATION AND DID 
THEY NOT HAVE A DISCUSSION 
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE USERS 
SHOULD BE INFORMED BACK IN 
DECEMBER OF 2015? 
>> SENATOR, IN RETROSPECT I 
THINK WE CLEARLY VIEW IT AS A 
MISTAKE THAT WE DIDN'T INFORM 
PEOPLE AND WE DID THAT BASED ON 
FALSE INFORMATION THAT WE 
THOUGHT THAT THE CASE WAS 
CLOSED AND THAT THE DATA HAD 
BEEN DELETED. 
>> SO THERE WAS A DECISION MADE 
ON THAT BASIS NOT TO INFORM THE 
USERS. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING, 
YES, BUT IN RETROSPECT I THINK 
THAT WAS A MISTAKE AND KNOWING 
WHAT WE KNOW NOW WE SHOULD HAVE 
HANDLED A LOT OF THINGS 
DIFFERENTLY. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT POINT. 
DO YOU KNOW WHEN THAT DECISION 
WAS MADE NOT TO INFORM THE 
USERS? 
>> I DON'T. 
>> OKAY. 
LAST NOVEMBER THE SENATE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HELD A 
HEARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA 
INFLUENCE. 
I WAS A PART OF THAT HEARING. 
I SUBMITTED 50 WRITTEN 
QUESTIONS TO FACEBOOK AND OTHER 
COMPANIES AND THE RESPONSES 
THAT WE RECEIVED WERE 
UNFORTUNATELY EVASIVE AND SOME 
WERE, FRANKLY, NONRESPONSIVE. 
SO I'M GOING TO ASK THE 
QUESTION AGAIN HERE. 
HOW MUCH REVENUE DID FACEBOOK 
EARN FROM THE USER ENGAGEMENT 
THAT RESULTED FROM FOREIGN 
PROPAGANDA? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, WHAT WE DO 
KNOW IS THAT THE IRA, THE 
INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY, THE 
RUSSIAN FIRM, RAN ABOUT 
$100,000 WORTH OF ADS. 
I CAN'T SAY THAT WE'VE 
IDENTIFIED ALL OF THE FOREIGN 
ACTORS WHO ARE INVOLVED HERE. 
SO I CAN'T SAY THAT THAT'S ALL 
OF THE MONEY, BUT THAT IS WHAT 
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED. 
>> OKAY. 
MY TIME IS UP. 
I'LL SUBMIT MORE QUESTIONS FOR 
THE RECORD. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR HARRIS. 
NEXT UP, SENATOR KENNEDY. 
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, I COME IN 
PEACE. 
 
>> I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO VOTE 
TO REGULATE FACEBOOK, BUT BY 
GOD, I WILL. 
A LOT OF THAT DEPENDS ON YOU. 
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN 
THIS HEARING TODAY. 
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT 
WE'RE CONNECTING. 
SO LET ME TRY TO LAY IT OUT FOR 
YOU FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. 
I THINK YOU ARE A REALLY SMART 
GUY AND I THINK YOU HAVE BUILT 
AN EXTRAORDINARY AMERICAN 
COMPANY AND YOU'VE DONE A LOT 
OF GOOD. 
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE 
BEEN ABLE TO DO ARE MAGICAL, 
BUT OUR PROMISED DIGITAL UTOPIA 
WE HAVE DISCOVERED HAS MINE 
FIELDS. 
THERE'S SOME IMPURITIES IN THE 
FACEBOOK PUNCH BOWL. 
AND THEY GOT TO BE FIXED AND I 
THINK YOU CAN FIX THEM. 
NOW HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
THERE ARE GOING TO BE A WHOLE 
BUNCH OF BILLS INTRODUCED TO 
REGULATE FACEBOOK. 
IT'S UP TO YOU WHETHER THEY 
PASS OR NOT. 
YOU CAN GO BACK HOME. 
SPEND $10 MILLION OR LOBBYISTS 
AND FIGHT US OR YOU CAN GO BACK 
HOME AND HELP US SOLVE THIS 
PROBLEM AND THERE ARE TWO. 
ONE IS A PRIVACY PROBLEM. 
THE OTHER ONE IS WHAT I CALL A 
PROPAGANDA PROBLEM. 
LET'S START WITH THE PRIVACY 
PROBLEM FIRST. 
LET'S START WITH THE USER 
AGREEMENT. 
HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO TELL YOU TODAY AND I  
YOUR USER AGREEMENT SUCKS. 
 
>> YOU CAN SPOT MY 75 IQ 
POINTS. 
IF I CAN FIGURE IT OUT. 
YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT. 
THE PURPOSE OF THAT USER 
AGREEMENT IS TO COVER 
FACEBOOK'S REAR END. 
IT'S NOT TO INFORM YOUR USERS 
ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS. 
NOW YOU KNOW THAT AND I KNOW 
THAT. 
I'M GOING TO SUGGEST TO YOU 
THAT YOU GO BACK HOME AND 
REWRITE IT AND TELL YOUR $1,200 
AN HOUR LAWYERS NO DISRESPECT. 
THEY'RE GOOD, BUT TELL THEM YOU 
WANT IT WRITTEN IN ENGLISH AND 
NONSWAHILI SO THE AVERAGE 
AMERICAN CAN UNDERSTAND IT. 
THAT WOULD BE A START. 
AS A FACEBOOK USER, ARE YOU 
WILLING TO GIVE ME MORE CONTROL 
OVER MY DATA? 
>> SENATOR, AS SOMEONE WHO USES 
FACEBOOK, I BELIEVE THAT YOU 
SHOULD HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL 
OVER YOUR DATA. 
>> OKAY. 
ARE YOU WILLING TO GO BACK AND 
WORK ON GIVING ME A GREATER 
RIGHT TO ERASE MY DATA? 
>> SENATOR, YOU CAN ALREADY 
DELETE ANY OF THE DATA THAT'S 
THERE OR DELETE ALL OF YOUR 
DATA. 
>> ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON 
EXPANDING THAT? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK WE ALREADY 
DO WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO, 
BUT CERTAINLY WE'RE ALWAYS 
WORKING ON TRYING TO MAKE THESE 
CONTROLS EASIER. 
>> ARE YOU WILLING TO EXPAND MY 
RIGHT TO KNOW WHO YOU'RE 
SHARING MY DATA WITH? 
>> SENATOR, WE ALREADY GIVE YOU 
A LIST OF APPS THAT YOU'RE 
USING AND YOU SIGNED INTO THOSE 
YOURSELF AND PROVIDED 
AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. 
AS I SAID BEFORE, WE DON'T 
SHARE ANY DATA WITH -- 
>> LIKE ON THAT USER AGREEMENT. 
ARE YOU WILLING TO EXPAND MY 
RIGHT TO PROHIBIT YOU FROM 
SHARING MY DATA? 
>> SENATOR, AGAIN I BELIEVE 
THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT 
CONTROL. 
SO I MEAN I THINK PEOPLE HAVE 
THAT FULL CONTROL IN THE SYSTEM 
ALREADY TODAY. 
IF WE AREN'T COMMUNICATING THIS 
CLEARLY, THEN THAT'S A BIG 
THING THAT WE SHOULD WORK ON 
BECAUSE I THINK THE PRINCIPLES 
THAT YOU ARE ARTICULATING ARE 
THE ONES THAT WE BELIEVE IN AND 
TRY TO CODIFY IN THE PRODUCT 
THAT WE BUILD. 
>> ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE ME 
THE RIGHT TO TAKE MY DATA ON 
FACEBOOK AND MOVE IT TO ANOTHER 
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM? 
>> SENATOR, YOU CAN ALREADY DO 
THAT. 
WE WE HAVE A DOWNLOAD 
INFORMATION TOOL WHERE YOU CAN 
GO, GET A FILE AND ALL THE 
CONTENT AND DO WHATEVER YOU 
WANT WITH IT. 
>> THEN I ASSUME YOU'RE WILLING 
TO GIVE ME THE RIGHT TO SAY I'M 
GOING TO GO ON YOUR PLATFORM 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
TELL A LOT ABOUT ME AS A 
RESULT, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO 
SHARE IT WITH ANYBODY. 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
I BELIEVE YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT 
ABILITY TODAY. 
PEOPLE CAN SIGN ON AND CHOOSE 
TO NOT SHARE THINGS AND JUST 
FOLLOW SOME FRIENDS OR SOME 
PAGES AND READ CONTENT IF 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. 
>> OKAY. 
I WANT TO BE SURE -- I'M ABOUT 
OUT OF TIME. 
IT GOES FAST, DOESN'T IT? 
LET ME ASK YOU ONE FINAL 
QUESTION IN MY 12 SECONDS. 
CAN SOMEBODY CALL YOU UP AND 
SAY I WANT TO SEE JOHN 
KENNEDY'S FILE? 
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. 
>> COULD YOU -- NOT WOULD YOU 
DO IT. 
COULD YOU DO IT? 
>> IN THEORY. 
>> DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUT 
MY DATA, A NAME ON MY DATA, AND 
SHARE IT WITH SOMEBODY? 
>> I DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO DO THAT. 
>> DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY? 
>> SENATOR, THE DATA IS IN THE 
SYSTEM. 
EVERY, SO -- 
>> DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY -- 
SYSTEM, SO -- 
>> DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY? 
>> TECHNICALLY WE HAVE THE 
ABLE, BUT IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE 
BREACH, SO WE WOULD NEVER DO 
THAT. 
>> IT WOULD BE A BREACH. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR KENNEDY. 
SENATOR BALDWIN IS UP NEXT. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND 
ENDURING A LONG DAY, MR. 
ZUCKERBERG. 
I WANT TO START WITH WHAT I 
HOPE CAN BE A QUICK ROUND OF 
QUESTIONS JUST SO I MAKE SURE I 
UNDERSTAND YOUR PREVIOUS 
TESTIMONY. 
SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE 
PROCESS BY WHICH CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE 
FACEBOOK USERS' DATA.  
IT WAS AN APPEAR DEVELOPER 
ALEKSANDR KOGAN WHO COLLECTED 
FACEBOOK DATA THROUGH A 
PERSONALITY QUIZ. 
IS THAT CONVECT? 
>> YES. 
>> HE THEREBY -- CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> HE THEREBY IS ABLE TO GAIN 
ACCESS TO DATA NOT ONLY BY 
PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE QUIZ BUT TO 
THEIR NETWORK. 
IS THAT CORRECT, TOO? 
>> SENATOR, YES. 
THE TERMS OF THE PLATFORM AT 
THE TIME ALLOWED FOR PEOPLE TO 
SHARE THEIR INFORMATION AND 
SOME BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT 
THEIR FRIENDS AS WELL. 
WE'VE SINCE CHANGED THAT AS OF 
2014. 
NOW THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. 
>> SO IN TOTAL ABOUT 87 MILLION 
FACEBOOK USERS. 
YOU EARLIER TESTIFIED ABOUT THE 
TWO TYPES OF WAYS YOU GAINED 
DATA. 
ONE IS WHAT IS VOLUNTARILY 
SHARED BY FACEBOOK MEMBERS AND 
USERS AND THE OTHER IS IN ORDER 
TO I THINK YOU SAID IMPROVE 
YOUR ADVERTISING EXPERIENCE, 
WHATEVER THAT EXACTLY MEANS, 
THE DATA FACEBOOK COLLECTS IN 
ORDER TO CUSTOMIZE OR FOCUS ON 
THAT. 
WAS ALEKSANDR KOGAN ABLE TO GET 
BOTH OF THOSE SETS OF DATA OR 
JUST WHAT WAS VOLUNTARILY 
ENTERED BY THE USER? 
>> YES. 
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 
IT WAS JUST A SUBSET OF WHAT 
WAS ENTERED BY THE PERSON AND 
-- 
>> SO A SUBSET OF THE 95 
CATEGORIES OF DATA THAT YOU 
KEEP? 
>> YES. 
WHEN YOU SIGN INTO AN APP, THE 
APP DEVELOPER HAS TO SAY HERE 
ARE THE TYPES OF DATA THAT FROM 
YOU I'M ASKING FOR INCLUDING 
PUBLIC INFORMATION LIKE YOUR 
NAME AND PROFILE, THE PAGES YOU 
FOLLOW, OTHER INTERESTS ON YOUR 
PROFILE, THAT KIND OF CONTENT. 
>> OKAY. 
>> THE APP  DEVELOPER HAS TO 
DISCLOSE THAT UP FRONT AND YOU 
AGREE TO THAT. 
>> SPECIFICALLY TO SENATOR 
FISHER YOU TALKED ABOUT 
FACEBOOK STORING THIS DATA AND 
I THINK YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT 
THE DATA BEING IN THE SYSTEM. 
I WONDER IF OUTSIDE OF THE WAY 
IN WHICH ALEKSANDR KOGAN WAS 
ABLE TO ACCESS THIS DATA, COULD 
FACEBOOK BE VULNERABLE TO A 
DATA BREACH OR HACK? 
WHY OR WHY NOT? 
>> WELL, THERE ARE MANY KINDS 
OF SECURITY THREATS THAT A 
COMPANY LIKE OURS FACES 
INCLUDING PEOPLE TRYING TO 
BREAK INTO OUR SECURITY 
SYSTEMS. 
>> OKAY. 
AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAD 
BEEN HACKED, DO YOU BELIEVE YOU 
WOULD HAVE THE DUTY TO INFORM 
THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED? 
>> YES. 
>> DO YOU KNOW WHETHER 
ALEKSANDR KOGAN SOLD ANY OF THE 
DATA HE COLLECTED WITH ANYONE 
OTHER THAN CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA? 
>> SENATOR, YES, WE DO. 
HE SOLD IT TO A COUPLE OF OTHER 
FIRMS. 
>> CAN YOU IDENTIFY THEM? 
>> YES. 
THERE'S ONE CALLED UNNOYA AND 
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF 
OTHER AS WELL. 
>> CAN YOU FURNISH THAT TO ME? 
>> YES. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 
THANK YOU. 
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW OR HAVE 
YOU TRIED TO FIND OUT HOW 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA USED THE 
DATA WHILE THEY HAD IT BEFORE 
YOU BELIEVE THEY DELETED IT? 
>> SINCE WE JUST HEARD THAT 
THEY DIDN'T DELETE IT ABOUT A 
MONTH AGO, WE'VE KICKED OFF AN 
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION TO SEE 
IF THEY USED THAT DATA IN ANY 
OF THEIR ADS, FOR EXAMPLE. 
THAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL 
UNDERWAY AND WE WILL -- WE CAN 
COME BACK TO THE RESULTS OF 
THAT ONCE WE HAVE THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
I WANT TO SWITCH TO MY 
HOMESTATE OF WISCONSIN. 
ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, MY 
HOMESTATE OF WISCONSIN WAS A 
MAJOR TARGET OF RUSSIAN BOUGHT 
ADS ON FACEBOOK IN THE 2016 
ELECTION. 
THESE DIVISIVE ADS TOUCHING ON 
A NUMBER OF VERY POLARIZING 
ISSUES WERE DESIGNED TO 
INTERFERE WITH OUR ELECTION. 
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT RUSSIAN 
ACTORS USING ANOTHER PLATFORM, 
TWITTER, SIMILARLY TARGETED 
WISCONSIN WITH DIVISIVE CONTENT 
AIMED AT SOWING DIVISION AND 
DISSENT INCLUDING IN THE WAKE 
OF A POLICE-INVOLVED SHOOTING 
IN MILWAUKEE'S SHERMAN PARK 
NEIGHBORHOOD IN AUGUST OF 2016. 
NOW I FIND SOME ENCOURAGEMENT 
IN THE STEPS YOU'VE OUTLINED 
TODAY TO PROVIDE GREATER 
TRANSPARENCY REGARDING 
POLITICAL ADS. 
I DO WANT TO GET FURTHER 
INFORMATION ON HOW YOU CAN BE 
CONFIDENT THAT YOU HAVE 
EXCLUDED ENTITIES BASED OUTSIDE 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
>> I'LL FOLLOW UP ON THAT. 
>> AND I THINK ON THAT TOPIC IF 
YOU REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF A 
POLITICAL AD'S SPONSOR, WHAT 
SORT OF TRANSPARENCY WILL YOU 
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WITH REGARD 
TO PEOPLE  WHO WEREN'T THE 
SUBJECT OF THAT AD SEEING ITS 
CONTENT? 
>> SENATOR, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO 
GO TO ANY PAGE AND SEE ALL OF 
THE ADS THAT THAT PAGE HAS RUN. 
SO IF SOMEONE IS RUNNING A 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, FOR 
EXAMPLE, AND THEY'RE TARGETING 
ONE DISTRICT WITH ONE AD AND 
ANOTHER DISTRICT WITH ANOTHER, 
HISTORICALLY IT'S BEEN HARD TO 
TRACK THAT DOWN, BUT NOW IT 
WILL BE VERY EASY. 
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ALL 
THE ADS THREE RUN, THE 
TARGETING ASSOCIATED WITH -- 
THEY'VE RUN, THE TARGETING 
ASSOCIATED WITH EACH TO SEE 
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TO 
DIFFERENT FOLKS AND IN SOME 
CASES HOW MUCH THEY'RE SPENDING 
ON THE ADS AND ALL OF THE 
RELEVANT INFORMATION. 
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I THINK 
MORE TRANSPARENCY WILL REALLY 
HELP DISCOURSE OVERALL AND ROOT 
OUT FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN 
ELECTIONS. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR BALDWIN. 
SENATOR JOHNSON. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG, FOR 
TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY 
OF YOUR USERS ACTUALLY READ THE 
TERMS OF SERVICE, THE PRIVACY 
POLICY, THE STATEMENT OF RIGHTS 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES, I MEAN 
ACTUALLY READ IT? 
>> SENATOR, I DO NOT. 
>> WOULD YOU IMAGINE IT'S A 
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE? 
>> SENATOR, WHO READ THE WHOLE 
THING? 
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT PROBABLY 
MOST PEOPLE DO NOT READ THE 
WHOLE THING, BUT EVERYONE HAS 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO AND CONSENTS 
TO IT. 
>> I AGREE, BUT THAT'S KIND OF 
TRUE OF EVERY APPLICATION WHERE 
YOU WANT TO GET TO IT AND YOU 
HAVE TO AGREE TO IT AND PEOPLE 
JUST PRESS THAT AGREE. 
THE VAST MAJORITY, CORRECT? 
>> SENATOR, IT'S REALLY HARD 
FOR ME TO MAKE A FULL 
ASSESSMENT, BUT -- 
>> COMMON SENSE WILL TELL YOU 
THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE 
CASE. 
WITH ALL THIS PUBLICITY HAVE 
YOU DOCUMENTED ANY KIND OF 
BACKLASH FROM FACEBOOK USERS? 
HAS THERE BEEN A DRAMATIC 
FALLOFF IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WHO UTILIZE FACEBOOK BECAUSE OF 
THESE CONCERNS? 
>> SENATOR, THERE HAS NOT. 
>> YOU HAVEN'T WITNESSED ANY? 
>> SENATOR, THERE WAS A 
MOVEMENT WHERE SOME PEOPLE WERE 
ENCOURAGING THEIR FRIENDS TO 
DELETE THEIR ACCOUNT AND I 
THINK THAT THAT GOT SHARED A 
BUNCH. 
>> SO IT'S KIND OF SAFE TO SAY 
THAT FACEBOOK USERS DON'T SEEM 
TO BE OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT 
ALL THESE REVELATIONS, ALTHOUGH 
OBVIOUSLY CONGRESS APPARENTLY 
IS. 
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK 
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. 
I THINK THESE ARE INCREDIBLY 
IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT PEOPLE 
WANT US TO ADDRESS AND I THINK 
PEOPLE HAVE TOLD US THAT VERY 
CLEARLY. 
>> IT SEEMS LIKE FACEBOOK USERS 
STILL WANT TO USE THE PLATFORM 
BECAUSE THEY ENJOY SHARING 
PHOTOS AND THEY SHARE THE 
CONNECTIVITY WITH THE FAMILY 
MEMBERS, THAT TYPE OF THING AND 
THAT OVERRIDES THEIR CONCERNS 
ABOUT PRIVACY. 
YOU TALK ABOUT THE USER OWNS 
THE DATA. 
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
PROPOSALS THAT HAD THAT DATA 
STAY WITH THE USER AND ALLOW 
THE USER TO MONETIZE IT 
THEMSELVES. 
YOUR COO MISS SANDBERG 
MENTIONED POSSIBLY IF YOU CAN'T 
UTILIZE THAT DATA TOO SELL 
ADVERTISING, PERHAPS WE'D -- TO 
SELL ADVERTISING, PERHAPS WE'D 
CHARGE PEOPLE TO GO ONTO 
FACEBOOK. 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
MODEL WHERE THE USER DATA IS 
ACTUALLY MONETIZED BY THE 
ACTUAL USER? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT SURE 
EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD WORK FOR 
IT TO BE MONETIZED BY THE 
PERSON DIRECTLY. 
IN GENERAL WE BELIEVE THE ADS 
MODEL IS THE RIGHT 1 FOR US 
BECAUSE IT ALIGNS -- RIGHT ONE 
FOR US BECAUSE IT ALIGNS WITH 
OUR SOCIAL MISSION TRYING TO 
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. 
>> BUT YOU'RE AWARE OF THE 
PROPOSAL, CORRECT? 
>> SENATOR, YES. 
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUGGEST WE 
SHOULD OFFER A VERSION WHERE 
PEOPLE CANNOT HAVE ADS IF THEY 
PAY A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. 
CERTAINLY WE CONSIDER IDEAS 
LIKE THAT. 
I THINK THEY'RE REASONABLE 
IDEAS TO THINK THROUGH, BUT 
OVERALL I THINK THAT THE ADS 
EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE THE 
BEST ONE. 
I THINK IN GENERAL PEOPLE LIKE 
NOT HAVING TO TAKE FOR A 
SERVICE. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO 
PAY FOR A SERVICE AROUND THE 
WORLD AND IN ALIGNS WITH OUR 
MISSION THE BEST. 
>> YOU ANSWERED SENATOR GRAHAM 
WHEN HE ASKED YOU IF YOU 
THOUGHT YOU WERE A MONOPOLY, 
YOU DIDN'T THINK. 
SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A BIG 
PLAYER IN THE SPACE. 
THAT MIGHT BE AN AREA FOR 
COMPETITION, CORRECT, IF 
SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS TO CREATE A 
SOCIAL PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS AIL 
USER TO MONETIZE THEIR -- A 
USER TO MONETIZE THEIR OWN 
DATA. 
>> SENATOR, YES. 
THERE ARE LOTS OF NEW SOCIAL 
APPS ALL THE TIME AND AS I SAID 
BEFORE, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN I 
THINK USES EIGHT DIFFERENT 
COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL APPS. 
SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
CHOICE AND INNOVATION AND 
ACTIVITY GOING ON IN THIS 
SPACE. 
>> I WANT TO IN A VERY SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME HERE TALK ABOUT 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
ADVERTISERS AND APPLICATION 
DEVELOPERS BECAUSE AGAIN YOU 
SAID IN EARLIER TESTIMONY THE 
ADVERTISERS HAVE NO ACCESS TO 
DATA WHATSOEVER, BUT 
APPLICATION DEVELOPERS DO. 
NOW IS THAT ONLY THROUGH THEIR 
OWN IS OF AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR 
CUSTOMERS OR DO -- OWN SERVICE 
AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS 
OR DO THEY ACTUALLY ACCESS DATA 
THROUGH THEIR OWN APPLICATIONS? 
>> SENATOR, WE GIVE PEOPLE THE 
ABILITY TO TAKE THEIR DATA TO 
ANOTHER APP IF THEY WANT. 
THIS IS A QUESTION THAT SENATOR 
KENNEDY ASKED ME JUST A FEW 
MINUTES AGO. 
THE REASON WHY WE DESIGNED THE 
PLATFORM THAT WAY IS BECAUSE WE 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL 
TO MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE COULD 
EASILY BRING THEIR DATA TO 
OTHER SERVICES. 
SOME PEOPLE INSIDE THE COMPANY 
ARGUED AGAINST THAT AT THE TIME 
BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT 
-- THEY SAID HEY, WE SHOULD 
úMA 
ONES WHO DEVELOP THIS STUFF. 
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A USEFUL 
THING FOR PEOPLE. 
>> THAT'S THE USER AGREEING TO 
ALLOW YOU TO SHARE, WHEN 
THEY'RE USING THAT A.M., TO 
ALLOW FACEBOOK TO SHARE -- APP 
TO ALLOW FACEBOOK TO SHARE 
DATA.  
DO THE DEVELOPERS EVER HAVE 
ACCESS TO THAT DATA PRIOR TO 
USERS USING IT? 
USING THE TERM SCRAPED DATA, 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
WHO SCRAPED THE DATA. 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION. 
THERE'S THE DEFORM  -- 
DEVELOPER PLATFORM WHICH IS THE 
SANCTIONED WAY TO ASK THAT 
QUESTION. 
A LOT OF THE INFORMATION PEOPLE 
CHOOSE TO PUT ON FACEBOOK ARE 
SHARING WITH EVERYONE ON THE 
WORLD, NOT PRIVATELY. 
YOU PUT YOUR NAME AND PROFILE 
PICTURE, THAT'S PUBLIC 
INFORMATION PEOPLE PUT OUT 
THERE AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO 
AREN'T REGISTERED DEVELOPERS OF 
FACEBOOK TRY TO LOAD A LOT OF 
PAGES TO GET ACCESS TO A BUNCH 
OF PEOPLE'S PUBLIC INFORMATION 
AND AGGREGATE IT. 
WE FIGHT BACK HARD AGAINST THAT 
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO 
AGGREGATE INFORMATION EVEN IF 
PEOPLE MADE IT PUBLIC AND CHOSE 
TO SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR JOHNSON. 
SENATOR HANSON. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG, FOR 
BEING HERE TODAY. 
I WANT TO TALK TO A COUPLE OF 
BROADER ISSUES. 
I'M CONCERNED THAT FACEBOOK'S 
PROFITABILITY RESTS ON TWO 
POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC 
FOUNDATIONS AND WE'VE HEARD 
OTHER SENATORS TALK ABOUT THIS 
A LITTLE TODAY. 
THE FOUNDATIONS ARE MAXIMIZING 
THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPEND 
ON YOUR PRODUCT AND CHECKING 
PEOPLE'S DATA. 
I'VE LOOKED AT FACEBOOK'S 2017 
CORPORATE FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
WHERE YOU LAY OUT SOME OF THE 
MAJOR RISKS TO YOUR BUSINESS. 
ONE RISK IS A DECREASE IN -- 
AND I QUOTE -- USER ENGAGEMENT 
INCLUDING TIME SPENT ON OUR 
PRODUCTS. 
THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE OF THE 
RESEARCH WE'VE SEEN SUGGESTING 
THAT TOO MUCH TIME SPENT ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA CAN HURT PEOPLE'S 
MENTAL HEALTH, ESPECIALLY YOUNG 
PEOPLE. 
ANOTHER MAJOR RISK TO YOUR 
BUSINESS IS THE POTENTIAL 
DECLINE IN -- AND HERE'S 
ANOTHER QUOTE -- THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR AD 
TARGETING OR THE DEGREE TO 
WHICH USERS OPT OUT OF CERTAIN 
TYPES OF AD TARGETING INCLUDING 
AS A RESULT OF CHANGES THAT 
ENHANCE THE USER'S PRIVACY. 
THERE'S CLEARLY TENSION,AS 
OTHER SENATORS HAVE POINTED 
OUT, BETWEEN YOUR BOTTOM LINE 
AND WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR USERS. 
YOU'VE SAID IN YOUR TESTIMONY 
THAT FACEBOOK'S MISSION IS TO 
BRING THE WORLD CLOSER TOGETHER 
AND YOU'VE SAID THAT YOU WILL 
NEVER PRIORITIZE ADVERTISERS 
OVER THAT MISSION AND I BELIEVE 
THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT. 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOUR 
BUSINESS MODEL DOES PRIORITIZE 
ADVERTISERS OVER THE MISSION. 
FACEBOOK IS A FOR PROFIT 
COMPANY AND AS A CEO YOU HAVE A 
LEGAL DUTY TO DO WHAT'S BEST 
FOR YOUR SHAREHOLDERS. 
SO GIVEN ALL OF THAT WHY SHOULD 
WE THINK THAT FACEBOOK ON ITS 
OWN WILL EVER TRULY BE ABLE TO 
MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED 
IT TO MAKE TO PROTECT 
AMERICANS' WELL-BEING AND 
PRIVACY? 
>> WELL, SENATOR, YOU RAISE A 
NUMBER OF IMPORTANT POINTS IN 
THERE. 
LET ME RESPOND IN A COUPLE 
DIFFERENT WAYS. 
>> SURE. 
>> THE FIRST IS THAT I THINK 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK 
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS 
BUILDING THIS COMMUNITY OVER 
THE LONG TERM. 
ANY BUSINESS HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS THAT 
MIGHT INCREASE REVENUE IN THE 
SHORT TERM, BUT AT THE EXPENSE 
OF TRUST OR BUILDING ENGAGEMENT 
OVER TIME. 
WHAT WE ACTUALLY FIND IS NOT 
NECESSARILY THAT INCREASING 
TIME SPENT, ESPECIALLY NOT JUST 
IN THE SHORT TERM, IS GOING TO 
BE BEST FOR OUR BUSINESS. 
IT ACTUALLY ALIGNS VERY CLOSELY 
WITH THE WELL-BEING RESEARCH 
THAT WE'VE DONE, THAT WHEN 
PEOPLE ARE INTERACTING  WITH 
OTHER PEOPLE AND POSTING AND 
BASICALLY BUILDING 
RELATIONSHIPS, THAT IS BOTH 
CORRELATED WITH HIGHER MEASURES 
OF WELL-BEING, HEALTH, 
HAPPINESS, NOT FEELING LONELY 
AND THAT ENDS UP BEING BETTER 
FOR THE BUSINESS THAN WHEN 
THEY'RE DOING LOWER VALUE 
THINGS LIKE JUST PASSIVELY 
CONSUMING CONTENT. 
I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 
POINT. 
>> I UNDERSTAND THE POINT 
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE HERE, BUT 
HERE'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED 
ABOUT. 
WE HAVE HEARD THIS POINT FROM 
YOU OVER THE LAST DECADE PLUS 
SINCE YOU FOUNDED FACEBOOK AND 
I UNDERSTAND YOU FOUNDED IT 
PRETTY MUCH AS A SOLO 
ENTREPRENEUR WITH YOUR 
ROOMMATE, BUT NOW YOU'RE 
SITTING HERE THE HEAD OF A 
BAZILLION DOLLAR COMPANY AND 
WE'VE HEARD YOU APOLOGIZE 
NUMEROUS TIMES AND PROMISE TO 
CHANGE, BUT HERE WE ARE AGAIN, 
RIGHT? 
SO I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN FREE 
ENTERPRISE, BUT WHEN PRIVATE 
COMPANIES ARE UNWILLING OR 
UNABLE TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY, 
PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE 
HISTORICALLY IN EVERY INDUSTRY 
STEPPED UP TO PROTECT OUR 
CONSTITUENTS AND CONSUMERS. 
YOU SUPPORTED TARGETED 
REGULATION SUCH AS THE HONEST 
ADS ACT AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 
STEP FOR ELECTION INTEGRITY. 
I'M PROUD TO BE A COSPONSOR OF 
THAT BILL, BUT WE NEED TO 
ADDRESS OTHER BROADER ISSUES AS 
WELL. 
TODAY YOU SAID YOU'D BE OPEN TO 
SOME REGULATION, BUT THIS HAS 
BEEN A PRETTY GENERAL 
CONVERSATION. 
SO WILL YOU COMMIT TO WORKING 
WITH CONGRESS TO DEVELOP WAYS 
OF PROTECTING CONSTITUENT 
PRIVACY AND WELL-BEING EVEN IF 
IT MEANS THAT THAT RESULTS IN 
SOME LAWS THAT WILL REQUIRE YOU 
TO ADJUST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL? 
>> SENATOR, YES. 
WE WILL COMMIT TO THAT. 
I THINK THAT THAT'S AN 
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE. 
OUR POSITION IS NOT THAT 
REGULATION IS BAD. 
I THINK THE INTERNET IS SO 
IMPORTANT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND 
IT'S GETTING MORE IMPORTANT. 
THE EXPECTATIONS ON INTERNET 
AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES 
OVERALL ARE GROWING AND I THINK 
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT IS 
THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK FOR THIS, 
NOT SHOULD THERE BE ONE. 
>> THAT IS VERY HELPFUL. 
AND I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION 
AND IT DOESN'T JUST GO TO 
FACEBOOK IS WHETHER THE 
FRAMEWORK SHOULD INCLUDE 
FINANCIAL PENALTIES WHEN LARGE 
PROVIDERS LIKE FACEBOOK ARE 
BREACHED AND PRIVACY IS 
COMPROMISED AS A RESULT BECAUSE 
RIGHT NOW THERE IS VERY LITTLE 
INCENTIVE FOR WHETHER IT'S 
FACEBOOK OR EQUIFAX TO ACTUALLY 
BE AGGRESSIVE IN PROTECTING 
CUSTOMER PRIVACY AND LOOKING 
FOR POTENTIAL BREACHES OR 
VULNERABILITIES IN THEIR 
SYSTEM. 
SO WHAT WE HEAR AFTER THE FACT, 
AFTER PEOPLE'S PRIVACY HAS BEEN 
BREACHED, AFTER THEY'VE TAKEN 
THE HARM THAT COMES WITH THAT 
AND CONSIDERABLE INCONVENIENCE 
IN ADDITION TO THE HARM, WE'VE 
HEARD APOLOGIES, BUT THERE IS 
NO FINANCIAL INCENTIVE RIGHT 
NOW IT SEEMS TO ME FOR THESE 
COMPANIES TO AGGRESSIVELY STAND 
IN THEIR CONSUMERS' STEAD AND 
PROTECT THEIR PRIEF AND I WOULD 
REALLY LOOK FORWARD -- PRIVACY 
AND I WOULD REALLY LOOK FORWARD 
TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT AND 
GETTING YOUR OPINION ON IT. 
>> SENATOR, WE LOOK FORWARD TO 
DISCUSSING IT WITH YOU. 
I WOULD DISAGREE, HOWEVER, THAT 
WE HAVE NO FINANCIA INCENTIVE 
OR INCENTIVE OVERALL TO DO 
THIS. 
THIS EPISODE HAS CLEARLY HURT 
US AND IT HAS CLEARLY MADE IT 
HARDER FOR US TO ACHIEVE THE 
SOCIAL MISSION THAT WE CARE 
ABOUT AND WE NOW HAVE TO DO A 
LOT OF WORK AROUND BUILDING 
TRUST BACK, WHICH IS JUST A 
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS. 
>> I THANK YOU. 
MY TIME IS UP. 
I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON 
THAT. 
>> SENATOR CAPITO. 
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN, AND 
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG, FOR 
BEING HERE TODAY. 
YOU SAID MORE THAN A FEW TIME 
FACEBOOK USERS CAN DELETE FROM 
THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME. 
WE KNOW IN THE COURSE -- I DO. 
I'VE GOT GRANDCHILDREN NOW, BUT 
CHILDREN, YOU TELL YOUR 
CHILDREN ONCE YOU MAKE THAT 
MARK IN THE INTERNET SYSTEM IT 
NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY. 
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS ONCE 
AN INDIVIDUAL DELETES THE 
INFORMATION FROM THEIR PAGE, 
IT'S GONE FOREVER FROM 
FACEBOOK'S ARCHIVES. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
I THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT, 
THOUGH, WHICH IS WE WILL DELETE 
IT FROM OUR SYSTEMS, BUT IF 
YOU'VE SHARED SOMETHING TO 
SOMEONE ELSE, THEN WE CAN 
GUARANTEE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE 
IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
>> OKAY. 
SO IF SOMEBODY LEAVES FACEBOOK 
AND THEN REJOINS AND ASKS 
FACEBOOK CAN YOU RECREATE MY 
PAST, YOUR ANSWER WOULD BE? 
>> IF THEY DELETE THEIR 
ACCOUNT, THE ANSWER IS NO. 
THAT'S WHY WE ACTUALLY OFFER 
TWO OPTIONS. 
WE OFFER DEACTIVATION WHICH 
ALLOWS YOU TO SHUT DOWN OR 
SUSPEND YOUR ACCOUNT BUT NOT 
DELETE THE INFORMATION BECAUSE 
ACTUALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT 
TO AT LEAST FOR SOME PERIOD OF 
TIME -- WE HEAR STUDENTS WITH 
EXAMS COMING UP WANT TO NOT BE 
ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE THEY WANT 
TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN FOCUS ON 
THE EXAM, SO THEY DEACTIVATE 
THEIR ACCOUNT TEMPORARILY BUT 
THEN WANT THE ABILITY TO TURN 
IT BACK ON WHEN THEY'RE READY. 
YOU CAN ALSO DELETE YOUR 
ACCOUNT, WHICH IS WIPING 
EVERYTHING. 
IF YOU DO THAT, YOU CAN'T GET 
IT BACK. 
>> IT'S GONE FROM YOUR 
ARCHIVES. 
>> YES. 
>> BUT IS IT EVER REALLY GONE? 
>> FROM OUR SYSTEMS IT IS. 
>> FROM THE CLOUD OR WHEREVER 
IT IS. 
I MEAN IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE 
ABLE TO REAPPEAR IN 
INVESTIGATIONS AND OTHER 
THINGS, NOT NECESSARILY 
FACEBOOK, BUT OTHER E-MAILS AND 
OTHER THINGS OF THAT NATURE. 
WHAT ABOUT THE INFORMATION 
GOING FROM THE PAST, THE 
INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN 
IN THE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 
CASE? 
YOU CAN'T REALLY GO BACK AND 
REDO THAT. 
SO I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT 
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH ON 
THE IMPROVEMENTS YOU'RE MAKING 
NOW ON FACEBOOK IS FROM THIS 
POINT FORWARD. 
IS THAT A CORRECT ASSUMPTION? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK WE CAN GO 
BACK IN SOME CASES AND THAT'S 
WHY ONE OF THE THINGS I 
ANNOUNCED IS WE'LL INVESTIGATE 
EVERY APP THAT HAD ACCESS TO A 
LARGE ALL OF INFORMATION BEFORE 
WE LOCKED DOWN PLATFORM IN 
2014. 
IF WE FIND ANY PATTERN OF 
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, THEN WE'LL 
DO A FULL AUDIT OF THEIR 
SYSTEMS. 
IF WE FIND ANYONE IS IMPROPERLY 
USING DATA, WE'LL TAKE ACTION 
TO MAKE SURE THEY DELETE THE 
DATA AND WE'LL INFORM EVERYONE 
WHO MAY HAVE HAD THEIR USED. 
>> THE OTHER DISCUSSION I WOULD 
-- THEIR DATA MISUSED. 
>> THE OTHER DISCUSSION I WOULD 
MAKE IS YOU HEARD THE LAPSE IN 
THE TIME OF WHEN YOU DISCOVERED 
AND WHEN YOU BECAME TRANSPARENT 
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU SENT OUT 
TWO MESSAGES JUST TODAY TO 
USERS. 
I WOULD SAY YOU REGRET THAT 
DECISION, THAT YOU WISH YOU'D 
BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT AT THE 
TIME. 
SO I WOULD IMAGINE IF DURING 
THE COURSE OF YOUR 
INVESTIGATION YOU FIND MORE 
BREACHES, SO TO SPEAK, YOU WILL 
BE REINFORMING YOUR FACEBOOK 
CUSTOMERS. 
>> YES, THAT IS CORRECT. 
WE HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED THAT 
IF WE FIND ANY IMPROPER USE, WE 
WILL INFORM EVERYONE AFFECTED. 
>> OKAY. 
THANK YOU. 
YOU'VE SAID, ALSO, THAT YOU 
WANT TO HAVE AN ACTIVE VIEW ON 
CONTROLLING YOUR ECOSYSTEM. 
LAST WEEK THE FDA COMMISSIONER 
SCOTT GOTTLIEB ADDRESSED A DRUG 
SUMMIT IN ATLANTA AND SPOKE ON 
THE NATIONAL OPIOID EPIDEMIC. 
I'M FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND 
THANK YOU FOR VISITING AND NEXT 
TIME YOU INVEST, IF YOU WOULD 
PLEASE BRING SOME VISIT, IF YOU 
WOULD PLEASE BRING SOME FIBER, 
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE 
CONNECTIVITY IN OUR RURAL AREAS 
AND FACEBOOK COULD REALLY HELP 
US WITH THAT. 
THE COMMISSIONER MENTIONED 
FACEBOOK WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 
IT TO TRY TO DISRUPT THE SALE 
OF ILLEGAL DRUGS AND 
PARTICULARLY THE POWERFUL 
OPIOID FENTANYL WHICH HUBBIESED 
AND SOLD ONLINE. 
I -- WHICH HAS BEEN ADVERTISED 
AND SOLD ONLINE. 
I WANT TO NOTE CAN I GET A 
COMMITMENT TODAY THAT FACEBOOK 
WILL COMMIT TO HAVING A 
REPRESENTATIVE FOR COMMISSIONER 
GOTTLIEB TO FINALIZE WITH THIS 
MEETING. 
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN 
IMPORTANT INITIATIVE AND WE 
WILL SEND SOMEONE AND ON YOUR 
POINT ABOUT CONNECTIVITY WE DO 
HAVE A GROUP AT FACEBOOK THAT 
IS WORKING ON TRYING TO SPREAD 
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IN RURAL 
AREAS AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO 
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT AS 
WELL. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY 
PASSIONATE ABOUT. 
>> THAT'S GOOD NEWS. 
LAST QUESTION, IF SOMEBODY 
ADVERTISES ON FACEBOOK AND 
SOMEBODY PURCHASES SOMETHING, 
DOES FACEBOOK GET A PERCENTAGE 
OR ANY KIND OF A FEE ASSOCIATED 
WITH A SUCCESSFUL PURCHASE FROM 
AN ADVERTISER? 
>> SENATOR, NO. 
THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS 
IS PEOPLE -- ADVERTISERS BID 
HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH IT TO THEM 
TO SHOW AN AD OR WHEN AN ACTION 
HAPPENS. 
SO IT'S NOT THAT WE WOULD GET A 
PERCENT OF THE SALE, BUT LET'S 
JUST USE AN EXAMPLE. 
LET'S SAY YOU'RE AN APP 
DEVELOPER AND YOUR GOAL IS YOU 
WANT TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO 
INSTALL YOUR APP. 
YOU COULD BID IN THE AD SYSTEM 
AND SAY I WILL PAY $3 ANY TIME 
SOMEONE INSTALLS THIS APP AND 
THEN WE BASICALLY CALCULATE ON 
OUR SIDE WHICH ADS ARE GOING TO 
BE RELEVANT FOR PEOPLE AND WE 
HAVE INCENTIVE TO SHOW PEOPLE 
ADS THAT ARE RELEVANT BECAUSE 
WE ONLY GET PAID WHEN IT 
DELIVERS A BUSINESS RESULT AND 
THAT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. 
WE GET PAID WHEN THE ACTION 
THAT THE ADVERTISER WANTS TO 
HAPPEN HAPPENS. 
>> SENATOR CORTEZ. 
>> THANK YOU. 
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANK YOU. 
IT'S BEEN A LONG AFTERNOON AND 
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND 
TAKING THE TIME WITH EVERY 
SINGLE ONE OF US. 
I'M GOING TO ECHO A LOT OF WHAT 
I'VE HEARD MY COLLEAGUES SAY 
TODAY AS WELL. 
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. 
I APPRECIATE THE APOLOGY, BUT 
STOP APOLOGIZING AND LET'S MAKE 
THE CHANGE. 
I THINK IT'S TIME TO REALLY 
CHANGE THE CONDUCT. 
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU 
TALKED ABOUT YOUR PRINCIPLES 
FOR FACEBOOK, NOTICED USERS ON 
THE USE OF THE DATA AND THAT 
USERS HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF 
THEIR DATA, BUT THE SKEPTICISM 
THAT I HAVE AND I'M HOPING YOU 
CAN HELP ME WITH THIS IS OVER 
THE LAST WHAT, SEVEN YEARS 
HAVEN'T SEEN REALLY MUCH CHANGE 
IN INSURING THAT THE PRIVACY IS 
THERE AND THAT INDIVIDUAL USERS 
HAVE CONTROL OF THEIR DATA. 
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
BACK IN 2009 YOU MADE TWO 
CHANGES TO YOUR PRIVACY POLICY 
AND, IN FACT, PRIOR TO THAT 
MOST USERS COULD EITHER 
IDENTIFY ONLY FRIENDS OR 
FRIENDS OF FRIENDS AS PART OF 
THEIR PRIVACY. 
CORRECT? 
IF THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THEIR 
DATA, THEY COULD IDENTIFY ONLY 
FRIENDS OR FRIENDS OF FRIENDS 
WHO COULD SEE THEIR DATA. 
ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 
>> SENATOR, I BELIEVE THAT 
WE'VE HAD THE OPTION FOR PEOPLE 
TO SHARE WITH FRIENDS, FRIENDS 
OF FRIENDS, A CUSTOM AUDIENCE 
OR PUBLICLY FOR A LONG TIME. 
I DONE REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN WE 
PUT THAT IN PLACE, BUT I 
BELIEVE THAT WAS BEFORE 2009. 
>> SOAR YOU CAN CHOOSE FRIENDS 
OR FRIENDS OF FRIENDS TO DECIDE 
HOW TO SHARE OR PROTECT THAT 
DATA, CORRECT? 
>> THOSE ARE TWO OF THE 
OPTIONS. 
>> IN 2011 WHEN THE FTC BEGAN 
LOOKING AT THIS, THEY WERE 
CONCERNED THAT IF SOMEBODY 
CHOSE ONLY FRIENDS, THAT THE 
INDIVIDUAL USER WAS UNDER THE 
IMPRESSION THEY COULD CONTINUE 
TO RESTRICT SHARING OF DATA TO 
A LIMITED AUDIENCE, BUT THAT 
WASN'T THE CASE AND, IN FACT, 
SELECTING FRIENDS ONLY DID NOT 
PREVENT USERS' INFORMATION FROM 
BEING SHARED WITH THIRD-PARTY 
APPLICATIONS THEIR FRIEND USED. 
ISN'T THAT THE CASE AND THAT'S 
WHY THE FTC WAS LOOKING AT YOU 
AND MAKING THAT CHANGE BECAUSE 
THERE WAS CONCERN THAT IF YOU 
HAD FRIENDS ON YOUR PAGE, A 
THIRD PARTY COULD ACCESS THAT 
INFORMATION? 
ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 
>> WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG. 
HE'S ANSWERING SENATORS' 
QUESTIONS. 
I WANT TO THANK OUR PANEL FOR 
JOINING ME FOR TODAY'S 
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING. 
DAN PATTERSON, SENIOR WRITER 
FOR TECH REPUBLIC, JENNIFER 
úGR 
COMMUNICATIONS AT SYRACUSE 
UNIVERSITY'S SCHOOL OF 
COMMUNICATIONS AND ROGER CHEN, 
EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF CNET NEWS. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK, BUT YOU CAN KEEP 
WATCHING THE REST OF THE 
HEARING AS WELL AS READ OUR 
LIVE BLOG BY GOING TO 
CBSNEWS.COM/FACEBOOK. 
>>> WE DIDN'T TAKE A BROAD 
ENOUGH VIEW OF OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THAT WAS A 
BIG MISTAKE AND IT WAS MY 
MISTAKE. 
AND I'M SORRY. 
>> IF YOU AND OTHER SOCIAL 
MEDIA COMPANIES DO NOT GET YOUR 
ACT IN ORDER, NONE OF US ARE 
GOING TO HAVE ANY PRIVACY 
ANYMORE. 
>> I STARTED FACEBOOK. 
I RUN IT. 
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 
HAPPENS HERE. 
>>> SYRIA'S MILITARY IS ON HIGH 
ALERT PREPARING FOR A POSSIBLE 
AIRSTRIKE AFTER SATURDAY'S 
APPARENT CHEMICAL WEAPONS 
ATTACK. 
>> NOTHING'S OFF THE TABLE. 
>> Reporter: A STRIKE WOULD BE 
A NEW PRECEDENT AND COULD RISK 
ESCALATING TENSIONS WITH 
SYRIA'S ALLIES IRAN AND RUSSIA. 
>>> DO YOU BELIEVE HE HAS THE 
POWER TO FIRE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
ROBERT MUELLER? 
>> HE BELIEVES HE HAS THE POWER
. 
>> OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD ME ONLY 
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD 
ROSENSTEIN CAN FIRE THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL. 
>> I'M NOT CONCERNED THAT HE 
WILL FIRE MUELLER. 
I'M CONFIDENT THAT WOULD BE THE 
BEGINNING OF THE END AND HE'S 
NOT GOING TO DO THAT. 
>>> HI, EVERYONE, I'M MEG 
OLIVER. 
CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG MADE A VERY 
PUBLIC APOLOGY TUESDAY IN THE 
WAKE OF THE PRIVACY SCANDAL AT 
THE COMPANY HE CREATED. 
ZUCKERBERG FACED TOUGH 
QUESTIONS ON CAPITOL HILL IN 
THE FIRST OF TWO DAYS OF 
TESTIMONY ABOUT THE WAY 
FACEBOOK HANDLED USER DATA. 
IT COMES AFTER THE PERSONAL 
INFORMATION OF 87 MILLION USERS 
ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. 
NANCY CORDES IS ON CAPITOL 
HILL. 
>> Reporter: THE MAN IN THE 
MIDDLE OF A FIRESTORM OVER 
PRIVACY LED OFF WITH A FULL MEA 
CULPA. 
>> WE DIDN'T TAKE A BROAD 
ENOUGH VIEW OF OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT WAS A 
BIG MISTAKE. 
AND IT WAS MY MISTAKE. 
AND I'M SORRY. 
>> Reporter: GRILLING HIM WERE 
DOZENS OF SKEPTICAL SENATORS. 
>> WE'VE SEEN THE APOLOGY TOUR 
AS BEFORE. 
>> Reporter: FACEBOOK HAS A 
HISTORY OF JEOPARDIZING USER 
DATA. 
>> AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF 
PROMISES TO DO BETTER, HOW IS 
TODAY'S APOLOGY DIFFERENT? 
>> WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF 
MISTAKES IN RUNNING THE 
COMPANY. 
I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH 
IMPOSSIBLE, I BELIEVE, TO START 
A COMPANY IN YOUR DORM ROOM AND 
GROW IT TO BE THE SCALE THAT WE 
ARE AT NOW WITHOUT MAKING SOME 
MISTAKES. 
>> THE MISTAKE, THE HARVESTING 
OF USER INFORMATION IN 2015 BY 
A THIRD-PARTY APP POSING AS A 
PERSONALITY QUIZ. 
THE DATA WAS SOLD TO CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA, A POLITICAL 
CONSULTING FIRM THAT WORKED FOR 
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 
>> WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THE 
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA THAT HAD 
FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED ALL OF 
THIS INFORMATION, WHY DIDN'T 
YOU INFORM THOSE 87 MILLION? 
>> WE DID TAKE ACTION. 
WE TOOK DOWN THE APP. 
AND WE DEMANDED THAT BOTH THE 
DEVELOPER AND CAMBRIDGE 
ANALYTICA DELETE AND STOP USING 
ANY DATA THAT THEY HAD. 
THEY TOLD US THEY DID THIS. 
IN RETROSPECT, IT WAS CLEARLY A 
MISTAKE TO BELIEVE THEM. 
>> Reporter: SOME ARGUED THE 
PROBLEM IS FACEBOOK ITSELF. 
>> YOUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO 
MONETIZE USER INFORMATION, TO 
MAXIMIZE PROFIT, OVER PRIVACY. 
>> Reporter: THEY SAID FACEBOOK 
DOESN'T MAKE IT CLEAR TO USERS 
HOW THEIR INFORMATION IS USED 
AND HOW TO PROTECT IT. 
>> IS FACEBOOK BEING SAFE? 
>> I THINK FACEBOOK IS SAFE. 
I USE IT AND MY FAMILY USE IT. 
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE CONTROL 
OVER HOW THEIR INFORMATION IS 
USED. 
EVERY TIME THEY CHOOSE TO SHARE 
SOMETHING, THEY HAVE CONTROL 
RIGHT THERE ABOUT WHO THEY WANT 
TO SHARE IT WITH. 
>> Reporter: THE DECISION TO 
SHARE APPEARED TO PAY OFF FOR 
HIM AND THE COMPANY. 
AFTER A MONTH LONG SLUMP, 
FACEBOOK STOCK JUMPED 4.5% THIS 
AFTERNOON. 
DRIVING HIS NET WORTH UP BY 
NEARLY $3 BILLION. 
>> NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE. 
>> Reporter: REPUBLICAN ORRIN 
HATCH ARGUED DATA COLLECTION 
COMES WITH BENEFITS FOR USERS OF
FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE. 
>> THESE GREAT WEBSITES THAT 
DON'T CHARGE FOR ACCESS, THEY 
EXTRACT VALUE IN SOME OTHER 
WAY. 
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH 
THAT AS LONG AS THEY ARE 
UPFRONT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING. 
>> NANCY JOINS US NOW. 
IT HAS BEEN ALMOST FIVE HOURS 
NOW, IT IS STILL GOING ON. 
I WANT TO START WITH AFTER A 
QUESTION FROM SENATOR PATRICK 
LEAHY, ZUCKERBERG SAID FACEBOOK 
IS COOPERATING WITH
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT 
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION INTO 
RUSSIAN MEDDLING. 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS WELL-
KNOWN? 
>> Reporter: IT WAS NOT. 
NOR WAS THE FACT THAT SOME 
FACEBOOK EXECUTIVES ACCORDING 
TO ZUCKERBERG, HAVE ACTUALLY 
BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL, WHICH IS LOOKING INTO 
RUSSIAN ELECTION MEDDLING WHICH 
WE KNOW TOOK PLACE BOTH ON 
FACEBOOK SITE AND ELSEWHERE. 
ZUCKERBERG SAID HE HIMSELF HAS 
NOT BEEN INTERVIEWED, AND THEN 
HE EVEN WENT SO FAR TO SAY THAT 
HE THOUGHT THAT FACEBOOK HAS 
BEEN SERVED A SUOENA BY THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
HE LATER MODIFIED THAT AND SAID 
HE WASN'T SURE WHETHER THEY HAD 
GOTTEN A SUBPOENA OR NOT. 
AND ADDED HE DIDN'T WANT TO 
GIVE A LOT OF DETAILS BECAUSE 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY 
SERIOUS AND ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION. 
BUT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO 
LEARN THAT FACEBOOK IS ACTIVELY 
WORKING WITH THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL AND LEADS YOU TO WONDER 
HOW MANY OTHER TECH COMPANIES 
ARE DOING THE SAME. 
>> NANCY, WE HEARD FROM SENATOR 
LINDSEY GRAHAM, HE ASKED 
ZUCKERBERG ABOUT A LACK OF 
COMPETITION AND OF HIS COMPANY 
IS A MONOPOLY. 
COULD WE SEE LAWMAKERS MOVE TO 
TRY TO REGULATE FACEBOOK AND 
OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES? 
>> Reporter: THERE IS CERTAINLY 
A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN 
THAT. 
THERE ARE MANY DEMOCRATS IN 
PARTICULAR WHO FEEL THAT THIS 
IS AN UNDER-REGULATED INDUSTRY. 
THAT IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE SOME 
PRIVACY CONTROLS IMPOSED BY THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 
THEY DON'T TRUST FACEBOOK AND 
SOME OF THESE OTHER COMPANIES 
TO SELF REGULATE. 
THEY SAY FACEBOOK HAS 
APOLOGIZED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 
AND HAS MADE SOME TOKEN ATTEMPTS
TO IMPOSE NEW PRIVACY CONTROLS 
ITSELF, BUT CLEARLY THEY DON'T 
BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS 
GONE FAR ENOUGH. 
THE REALITY IS THAT CONGRESS IS 
CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS WHO 
HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ROLL BACK 
REGULATIONS, NOT IMPOSE NEW 
ONES. 
THE LIKELIHOOD THEY ARE GOING 
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN AN 
ELECTION YEAR WHERE THEY ARE 
GETTING VERY LITTLE DONE AS IT 
IS AS THEY PREPARE FOR MIDTERMS 
COMING UP, IT'S PRETTY 
UNLIKELY. 
>> ZUCKERBERG WILL TESTIFY 
BEFORE THE HOUSE ON WEDNESDAY. 
HOW WILL THAT DIFFER FROM WHAT 
WE SAW ON TUESDAY? 
>> Reporter: THE HOUSE TENDS TO 
BE MORE FREEWHEELING, THE 
QUESTIONS THAT ZUCKERBERG HAS 
BEEN GETTING IN THE SENATE HAVE 
BY AND LARGE PERTAINED TO THE 
ISSUE AT HAND. 
TO PRIVACY, RUSSIA, BUT HE 
COULD GET QUESTIONS THAT GO A 
LOT FURTHER AFIELD WHEN HE IS 
GOING BEFORE THE HOUSE. 
HE DOES NOW HAVE MANY HOURS OF 
EXPERIENCE UNDER HIS BELT. 
YOU COULD SEE HIM GET MORE AND 
MORE COMFORTABLE AS THIS 
HEARING WENT ALONG. 
IT IS HIS FIRST TIME TESTIFYING 
BEFORE CONGRESS, AND LIKE 
ANYONE, HE WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS 
AT THE BEGINNING. 
WHO WOULDN'T BE WHEN THEY ARE 
CONFRONTED WITH 50 CAMERAS IN 
THEIR FACE? 
RIGHT BEFORE THEY START TO GET 
GRILLED BY SENATORS. 
BUT HE STARTED TO LOOSEN UP AND 
IN FACT WHEN HE WAS OFFERED A 
BREAK AFTER KATE -- AFTER A 
COUPLE HOURS BY THE COMMERCE 
úC 
HE SAID NO, I'M ACTUALLY KIND 
OF ENJOYING THIS, LET'S GO ON A 
LITTLE BIT LONGER. 
AND JOHN KUHN SAID OKAY, SURE. 
SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING 
THAT ZUCKERBERG HAS GOTTEN 
PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH AS THE 
HOURS STRETCH ON. 
>> NANCY, I NEED TO ASK YOU 
ABOUT THAT FOUR-INCH CUSHION 
THAT ZUCKERBERG SET ON IN HIS 
SENATE HEARING. 
IT IS GETTING A LOT OF 
ATTENTION. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT? 
>> Reporter: WE HAVE BEEN DOING 
SOME DIGGING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS 
CAUGHT ON ON SOCIAL MEDIA, 
PEOPLE ASKING WHETHER FACEBOOK 
USED THIS CUSHION TO MAKE HIM 
LOOK TALLER, LOOK MORE 
IMPOSING, WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT
A LOT OF THESE HEARINGS COME 
DOWN TO OPTICS, BUT HERE'S WHAT 
I CAN TELL YOU. 
I HAVE SPOKEN TO A SENATE 
COMMERCE COMMITTEE AIDE WHO 
SAYS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 
WAS REQUESTED BY FACEBOOK. 
IT IS SIMPLY PART OF THE SETUP 
OF THE ROOM. 
THAT OFTEN FOLKS WHO ARE 
TESTIFYING GET THESE CUSHIONS 
BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE 
AND BECAUSE IT MAKES IT EASIER 
TO SEE THEM OVER THESE LARGE 
DESKS THEY SIT BEHIND. 
I ALSO REACHED OUT TO FACEBOOK 
AND THEY BASICALLY SAID THE 
SAME THING, THEY DID NOT ASK 
FOR THIS CUSHION, THAT IT WAS 
SIMPLY PROVIDED BY THE 
COMMITTEE. 
IF WE GET MORE ON THIS, YOU 
WILL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW. 
BUT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S 
A BIG GRAND SCHEME RIGHT NOW. 
>> WE CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU 
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. 
NANCY CORDES, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 
>>> FOR MORE ON TUESDAYS 
FACEBOOK HEARING, I WANT TO 
BRING IN DAN PATTERSON, SENIOR 
WRITER FOR TECHREPUBLIC AND 
ALSO HERE WITH ME, JENNIFER 
GRYGIEL, PROFESSOR OF 
COMMUNICATIONS AT SYRACUSE. 
AND ROGER CHENG, EXECUTIVE 
úEDI 
FOR BEING HERE. 
LET'S START WITH HOW DID HE DO? 
WAS THIS A GOOD DAY FOR 
ZUCKERBERG? 
>> A GREAT DAY. 
IN TERMS OF HIS PERFORMANCE, HE 
OVER PERFORMED EXPECTATIONS. 
HE WAS ABLE TO DODGE AND BLOCK 
A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 
WERE FROM THE LUDDITE SENATORS. 
AND FOR THE TECH SAVVY 
SENATORS, HE WAS ABLE TO SPIN 
AND PUSH AWAY QUESTIONS THAT 
WOULD BE INCISIVE. 
WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH. 
IF IF -- IF I WAS ON HIS PR 
TEAM, I WOULD BE HIGH-FIVING. 
>> JENNIFER, WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE 
AWAY WHEN YOU WATCHED HIM? 
SEEMED AS IF HE GOT MORE 
COMFORTABLE, HE WAS RESPECTFUL, 
NOT KNOWN FOR BEING A DYNAMIC 
PERSONALITY, BUT HOW DO YOU 
THINK HE DID? 
>> TODAY WAS A VERY IMPORTANT 
DAY FOR THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL 
MEDIA. 
MARK ZUCKERBERG IS THE CEO AND 
MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER. 
ALSO OWNS WHATSAPP, INSTAGRAM 
AND MESSENGER. 
HE SHOWED UP TODAY AND I THINK 
HE ANSWERED SOME TOUGH 
QUESTIONS. 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FOLLOW-ON 
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. 
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RIGHT SOME 
REGULATIONS FOR A SAFER 
ENVIRONMENT. 
>> AS WE HEARD FROM LINDSEY 
GRAHAM AS WE WERE JUST 
DISCUSSING, IS FACEBOOK A 
MONOPOLY? 
SHOULD THERE BE REGULATIONS? 
ROGER, WHAT DID YOU TAKE AWAY 
FROM WHAT WE HEARD ON THAT 
TOPIC? 
>> WE HEARD FROM ZUCKERBERG 
THAT HE IS OPEN TO REGULATION 
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ON 
HIS TERMS, HE USED THE TERM THE 
RIGHT REGULATION, WHEN HE WAS 
ASKED SEVERAL TIMES WHETHER OR 
NOT HE WOULD BE SUPPORTING OPT 
IN MEASURES FOR HIS SERVICE. 
HE SAID YES, IN PRINCIPLE. 
HE COACHED A LOT OF HIS ANSWERS 
AND DID VERY WELL -- BUT HE 
FOUND A WAY TO KIND OF GET OUT 
OF ANY TIME HE WAS BACKED INTO 
A CORNER HE GOT OUT OF THE 
QUESTION FAIRLY SMARTLY. 
>> DO YOU THINK WE WILL SEE 
REGULATIONS? 
>> SEEMS LIKE THERE WILL BE, 
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHO IS 
GOING TO DICTATE WHAT THE 
REGULATIONS LOOK LIKE? 
AS WE'VE SEEN TODAY WITH THE 
QUESTIONS, A LOT OF SENATORS 
ARE ILL-EQUIPPED TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT FACEBOOK DOES AND EVEN ITS 
CORE MODEL, SO IT'S UNCLEAR 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GOING 
TO BE CAPABLE OR JUST TAKE 
ZUCKERBERG'S SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT
REGULATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE. 
>> INTERESTING POINT. 
DO YOU THINK THE SENATORS ARE 
THE BEST PEOPLE TO BE 
QUESTIONING HIM ON THIS? 
>> THEY ARE THE PEOPLE'S 
REPRESENTATIVES AND WHEN YOU 
HAVE A PLATFORM OF THE SCALE OF 
2 BILLION PEOPLE, THERE'S A LOT 
OF AMERICANS IN THAT SAMPLE. 
THEY ARE NOT THE MOST 
TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY GROUP AS 
WE KNOW. 
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS A 
REQUIREMENT THAT YOU BE 
TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY IN ORDER 
TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL 
MECHANICS OF FACEBOOK. 
OR TO ASK THAT YOUR PRIVACY BE 
RESPECTED. 
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT. 
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO KNOW CODE 
IN ORDER FOR YOUR ACTIONS AND 
ACTIVITIES TO BE SILOED AND 
PRIVATE. 
>> THEY DID BRING UP THE TALK 
ABOUT OVERSEAS, MUCH TOUGHER 
RESTRICTIONS ABOUT DELETING 
CONTENT. 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT AND 
DO YOU THINK THAT IS SOMETHING 
LAWMAKERS ARE LOOKING AT? 
>> I THINK THE PLATFORM IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT OF 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO ADDRESS 
GDPR IN EUROPE, SO WHAT COULD 
HAPPEN IS WHAT WE CALL 
HARMONIZATION. 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE ENHANCING 
THIS PLATFORM SO THEY CAN PORT 
IT OVER HERE. 
WE COULD SEE SOME ALIGNMENT AND 
IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO START. 
EUROPE HAS BEEN LEADING THE 
WAY. 
WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT OUR POLITICIANS ARE MORE 
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN A 
LOT OF THE GENERAL POPULACE. 
YOU CAN'T RUN A MODERN 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN WITHOUT 
SOCIAL MEDIA. 
SO THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
OF A CLUE THAN MOST PEOPLE, SO 
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I 
THINK -- I THINK SOME OF THEIR 
QUESTIONING WAS PRETTY GOOD 
TODAY AND STRATEGIC. 
>> ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 
STOOD OUT TO ME, AND ROGER, 
FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN, DICK 
DURBIN ASKING ABOUT PRIVACY AND 
HE HAD THE QUESTION THAT KIND 
OF -- YOU HEARD SILENCE IN THE 
ROOM, WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE 
TELLING US WHICH HOTEL YOU 
STAYED IN LAST NIGHT? 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
>> THAT WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE 
OF SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO 
BE TECHNICALLY SAVVY BUT GOT 
THE ANSWER THAT GOT TO THE 
CORE. 
ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE LINE 
OF QUESTIONING, THE TRAP THAT 
WAS SET FOR MARK ZUCKERBERG. 
AND IT SHOWS THAT WE DON'T NEED 
TO BE TECHNICALLY SAVVY TO 
UNDERSTAND, BUT THE PRIVACY 
ISSUE IS DEFINITEY FRONT AND 
CENTER. 
>> THERE WAS A BIG PAUSE FROM 
MARK ZUCKERBERG BEFORE HE 
ANSWERED THAT. 
THAT WAS THE TIME HE REALLY -- 
THE FIRST TIME HE REALLY 
PAUSED. 
>> I THINK YOU COULD SORT OF 
SEE AND PROCESS THE FACT HE GET 
LURED INTO A TRAP AND HIS FACE 
WENT FROM A GRIN BECAUSE HE WAS 
LAUGHING ABOUT THE INITIAL 
QUESTION AND IT WENT COMPLETELY 
-- JUST STONEFACED AT THAT 
POINT. 
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SENATOR 
WHITAKER WHEN HE WAS ASKED 
ABOUT -- EVEN AFTER THEY'VE 
LOGGED OUT OF FACEBOOK, THIS IS 
AN INTERESTING EXCHANGE. 
WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT ON THE 
OTHER SIDE. 
>> SENATOR, I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
-- SO IT WOULD BE BETTER TO 
HAVE MY TEAM FOLLOW UP -- 
>> YOU DON'T KNOW? 
>> I KNOW THAT PEOPLE USE 
COOKIES ON THE INTERNET AND 
THAT YOU CAN PROBABLY CORRELATE 
ACTIVITY BETWEEN SESSIONS. WE 
DO THAT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS 
INCLUDING SECURITY AND INCLUDING
MEASURING ADS TO MAKE SURE THE 
EXPERIENCES ARE THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE, WHICH OF COURSE 
PEOPLE CAN OPT OUT OF. 
>> ALL RIGHT, THAT ANSWER COULD 
CONCERN A LOT OF USERS. 
EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT HE'S 
TALKING ABOUT. 
>> HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE USE 
OF COOKIES, WHICH ARE A 
TRACKING TECHNOLOGY -- EVERY 
WEBSITE YOU GO TO, WHETHER YOU 
ARE ON MOBILE OR DESKTOP, DROPS 
THESE LITTLE DOCUMENTS. 
WHAT HE IS NOT DOING AND THE 
WAY HE COACHED WAS SOME PEOPLE, 
YOU CAN USE THEM TO CORRELATE 
THINGS. 
HE IS NOT BEING HONEST ABOUT 
THE DEGREE TO WHICH COOKIES 
TRACK YOUR BEHAVIOR AND YOUR 
ACTIVITY. 
AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THERE 
IS A DO NOT TRACK LIST, THE 
DEGREE TO WHICH COMPANIES DO 
NOT ADHERE TO -- DO NOT ADHERE 
TO THE DO NOT TRACK LIST. 
WHAT HE IS TRYING TO COUCH IS 
ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTALLY THE 
BUSINESS MODEL OF ALMOST EVERY 
INTERNET COMPANY, TO SELL ADS, 
COOKIES ARE TREMENDOUSLY 
IMPORTANT. 
AND SUPER COOKIES, A PIECE OF 
TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL RESPOND 
ONCE YOU HAVE DELETED IT FROM 
YOUR COMPUTER, IS SOMETHING 
THAT IS PERNICIOUS AND STICKS 
AROUND ON YOUR MACHINE. 
>> JENNIFER, ZUCKERBERG DID 
ADMIT THE COMPANY WAS SLOW TO 
REACT TO THE RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION. 
YOU KNOW, HE SAID HE'S GOING TO 
TAKE STEPS TO DO BETTER IN THE 
FUTURE. 
GOING BACK TO TEACHING AT 
SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, ARE YOU 
GOING TO TELL YOUR STUDENTS, 
THAT'S ENOUGH? 
>> OH, MY GOSH, TALK TO MY 
STUDENTS, THEY ALREADY KNOW ALL 
ABOUT THIS. 
IF ANYTHING, THEY ARE WELL-
INFORMED. 
IT'S THE REST OF THE POPULATION 
THAT NEEDS TO GET UP
