we're having a meeting big meeting at mar-a-lago go up the southern white house which it actually is is originally built as the southern white ass a lot of people don't know but it's sort of strange how it got there everybody always wants to go to the southern way Trump has spent 146 days of his presidency at Trump properties it is clear his favorite is Mara Lago in Florida where he has spent sixty eight days fully 15 percent of his presidency and when he is on site he talks up the amenities of the mar-a-lago club as if he is VP of Sales and this week's visit of a Bey of Japan provided the president with just his latest opportunity many of the world's great leaders requests to come tomorrow Lago and Palm Beach they like it I like it we're comfortable we have great relationships as you remember we were here and President Xi of China was here and when we do it it was originally built as the southern white house it was called the southern white house many many people want to be here many of the leaders want to be here they request specifically thank you very much I'd like to just maybe conclude it's an honour that you wanted to be at mar-a-lago we have a lot of people they want to be here it's just a special place and somehow it makes people feel good and that's good for relationship a note about these repeated mentions of the southern white house that never happened in the end the heiress of the post serial fortune Marjorie Merriweather Post owned mar-a-lago and used it as her winter getaway she donated the property to the federal government in hopes that it would turn into the winter white house but presidents Nixon Ford and Carter passed on that opportunity because it would have cost so much for the government to maintain the famously frugal Jimmy Carter eventually gave it back to Marjorie Merriweather posts heirs in 1981 Donald Trump bought it in 85 other presidents did have vacation places in Florida most famously Harry Truman and Key West and Richard Nixon and Key Biscayne all of it brings us to the issue of trumps businesses and their operation during his presidency our friend Anita Kumar of McClatchy Newspapers who was with us just last night writes that according to a new report set for release on Monday Trump's US businesses have received at least 15 point 1 million dollars in revenue from political groups and federal agencies since 2015 the biggest chunk of money coming from his campaign mar-a-lago is listed as one of the recipients of that money hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
