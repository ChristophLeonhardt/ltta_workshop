this is an insane story brought to you by the government of Saudi Arabia so they have a lot of influence in different parts of the Middle East including Lebanon so they invited the prime minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri over to Saudi Arabia to talk to him because they were not happy because he leads a coalition government now he's Sunni and and the Saudis are Sunni that's good they should be on the same team as you gonna see historically they have been on the same team in a lot of ways but part of his coalition government Hariri score coalition government includes Shia and includes Hezbollah as well as a strange character there because they are partly a rebel group outside of the state they do terrorism from time to time but they're also a political party that participates in the Lebanese government so that's for us here in the US that's a little mind twisting it's a little hard to understand but that is the reality of Lebanon and he can't run the government without them they need some sort of coalition government otherwise they're gonna go to war and it's not like Lebanon hasn't been ripped apart by Civil War it has so it's a fragile piece that they're keeping well the Saudis are apparently upset about that so because right now they're in the middle of fighting against Shias so if you don't know the two major Muslim factions are Sunni Shia most of the Muslim world is Sunni but Iran and some of their allies including in Yemen or Shia and the Saudis right now are bombing the living hell out of Yemen and the US by selling their weapons is helping them to do that and gross human rights violations here in the US we shouldn't have a dog in that fight I've got issues with the Shia Muslims in Iran I've got issues with the Sunni Muslims in Saudi Arabia not the actual human beings with their governments and the actions that they're taking but we have decided that Saudi Arabia has more oil I mean is a more important ally than Iran and so we're backing them in the destruction of Yemen and so since some of the allies of Iran are going against Saudi Arabia there they are livid and they pull in Hariri but here's where this story gets crazy he thinks that he's going to a normal diplomatic mission he's the leader of one country he's going to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who is the leader of he's not the leader yet Saturday everybody but in effect he is because he's imprisoning people and taking action etc he's the crown prince so and and he thinks he's gonna go camping in the desert with him it turns out no they're going camping but a different kind of camp so when he goes at 8:30 in the morning to meet the Crown Prince he the New York Times picks up the story they say he was stripped of his cell phones separated from all but one of his usual cluster of bodyguards and shoved and insulted by the Saudi security officers then came the ultimate indignity he was handed a pre-written resignation speech and forced to read it on Saudi television that's the prime minister of a different country that's mental they kidnapped the leader of a foreign country and made him read a statement on air New York Times talked to a dozen diplomats both in the West and Lebanon and and in the area overall so this is really well sourced they explained this is seemed was the real reason he had been back into the Saudi capital Riyadh a day earlier to resign under pressure and publicly blame Iran as if he were an employee and not a sovereign leader before going on TV he was not even allowed to go to the house he owns there he had to ask the guards to bring him a suit so clearly a prisoner at that point so the Prince intended to send a message the crown prince New York Times explains for Saudi Arabia it was time to stop Iran's Lebanese ally Hezbollah the powerful shared organization that is Lebanon's most influential political actor from growing so stronger so why does Hariri have to listen to him I mean it would what are they gonna just keep him in prison now I think what can they do to him if he's the leader of a different country well let's look into them like his father Rafiq before him mr. Hariri owed his political career and considerable family fortune to the Saudi backing but the Saudis grumbled that mr. hurries government was giving too much sway to Hezbollah which is both a political party and a militant group not answerable to the state so he partly got there through the Saudis so they're basically calling in their chips so what else do they have on him Saudi Arabia had many pressure points to use against mr. Hariri it could threaten to expel the 250 thousand or so Lebanese workers in Saudi Arabia damaging Lebanon's economy and I don't think that was it but anyway New York Times continues and since mr. Hariri is a dual Saudi citizen with extensive business dealings in a country where kickbacks are endemic they could threaten him personally an arab diplomat said mr. hurry was threatened with corruption charges so that is the excuse that the crown prince is used to imprison his political opponents in in Saudi Arabia including one of the richest men alive Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is in a you know basically in a prison in a fancy hotel on Saturday bill along with a lot of other Saudi princes this is a massive power play by the crown prince so I guess he was threatening to imprison a prime minister of a different country I guess they think they're also untouchable all right we'll get into that a second hours later the Saudi authorities began their corruption roundups detaining two of mr. Herrera's former business partners a reminder of his own vulnerability in other words if you don't play ball we will literally imprison you just like we did with your business associates right there and make sure you don't get out so did it work well mr. hurry rescinded his resignation immediately after an international diplomatic scramble brought him safely home and and look I get frustrated with us helping the Saudis destroy Yemen helping them spread their fundamentalist Islam ideology throughout the world I don't know why in the world we would help with that that's also insane in this case the US French and other diplomats Western diplomats did do a good job of putting pressure on the Saudis to let the prime minister go and and that worked so now mr. Hariri remains in office the New York Times explains with new popularity and Hezbollah is stronger than before oops Hey look at that a dictator with a bad plan didn't see that coming but it turns the plans of the Saudi government are worse than we even expected so New York Times continues to explain as bizarre as theft so it was it was just one chapter in the story of Prince Mohammed the ambitious young heir apparent determined to shake up the power structure not just of his own country but of the entire region at home he has jailed hundreds of fellow princes and businessmen in what he cast as an anti-corruption Drive abroad he has waged war in Yemen and confronted Qatar so is it really an anti-corruption Drive you think the crown prince is not corrupt you think the king is not corrupt you think all those Prince's are not corrupt the whole system is built on corruption so at any point anyone can do a Power Move by going oh I'll point out the other princes corruptions and he rounded them all up this is a purge Trump is good friends with the Saudis I hope he's not learning these lessons but we hear purges here in the US Republican Congressmen now bragging about it all over TV that they're gonna do likewise anyway back to senator ABO with anxieties running high Lebanese officials work to head off what they had feared was a long-range plan by Saudi Arabia to destabilize Lebanon's volatile Palestinian refugee camps oh great because things aren't messed up enough in the Middle East our so-called allies Saudi Arabia are planning to destabilize Palestinian camps who do you think that's gonna blow up on its gonna blow up on Lebanon it's gonna blow up on the entire Middle East is gonna blow up on us but it's also gonna blow up on Israel you think it's a good idea to destabilize Palestinian refugee camps meanwhile the Saudi prince apparently undaunted by international concerns summon yet another leader the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and issued instructions on Palestinian politics officials differ on what mr. Abbas was told in Riyadh oh great so now he's telling a Palestinian leader what to do the satiric recommendations to mr. Abbas could destabilize the fractious Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon as senior eleven ease officials said separately a Lebanese ally of the Saudis had urged jihadist factions in one Palestinian can to form a quote Sunni and resistance militia to counter Hezbollah an ideas so dangerous that the jihadist themselves refused Lebanese and Palestinian officials and a Western diplomat said that's a lot of sources that stories incredibly likely to be true and accurate so these lunatics went to a bunch of Sunni jihadists and said hey why don't you go start fighting the Shia jihadis any that idea was so crazy that even the jihadists were like boy man that's that's a really bad idea great what wonderful allies we have in Saudi Arabia and now the latest well some parts of this planet have worked mister nasrallah that's the leader of the Hezbollah in Lebanon his speeches have omitted critiques of Prince Mohammed lately and on Wednesday he called for peace talks in Yemen a major step well look I want peace in Yemen so that's wonderful so but did it overall work one of the things that they were enraged about in Saudi Arabia was a rocket had been fired towards Riyadh their capital well you're firing non-stop rockets into Yemen and pulverizing the country but how dare you we are above everything we are the royalty of Saudi Arabia so that main intent was of course to protect themselves and to purge out all their opponents so did that work well then again on Tuesday Yemen's Houthis fired another missile at Riyadh so no it did not work it didn't work in getting Hariri out of office it didn't work and thank God destabilizing the Palestinian refugee camps and it didn't work in stopping missiles into their own country well what did the crown prince think what did the king think when they went to war in Riyadh they thought what all right wingers across the world think war will give us peace did it absolutely not now the kidnappings and the purges have begun has that given them peace absolutely not or does not lead to peace peace Lisa peace I know that that the right-wingers and unfortunately a lot of the press in the world fine to be a radical idea it's not it's a smart idea it's a logical idea we should maybe encourage our allies to go in that direction instead of these lunatic maneuvers where they try to destabilize the entirety of the Middle East with allies like this you don't need enemies Young Turks if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
