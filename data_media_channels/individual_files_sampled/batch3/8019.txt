♪ ♪ Tucker: A GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT." THE PRESIDENT HELD ITS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE IN OVER A YEAR THIS AFTERNOON, HE TOOK QUESTIONS FOR AN HOUR AND A 21 MINUTES AND 44 SECONDS, BECAUSE WE WERE COUNTING. IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH'S SUPREME COURT NOMINATION BUT IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, HERE'S PART OF WHAT HE SAID. President Trump: THEY HAVE DESTROYED A MAN'S REPUTATION AND THEY WANT TO DESTROY IT EVEN MORE AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT IN THE MIDTERMS. WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS FAMILY, BUT THEY'VE DONE TO THESE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN OF HIS AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO HIS WIFE. AND THEY KNOW IT IS A BIG FAT CON JOB. THEY GO INTO A ROOM AND I GUARANTEE YOU THEY LAUGH LIKE HELL. 36 YEARS, THERE IS NO CHARGE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE HEARINGS ARE OVER AND THE RUMORS START COMING OUT. THEN, YOU HAVE THIS OTHER CON ARTIST, MICHAEL AVENATTI, COME OUT WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY TODAY. LOOK, THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE. THESE ARE CON ARTISTS. THE PRESS DOESN'T KNOW IT IN THE PRESS DOESN'T WRITE IT. I COULD PICK ANOTHER COURT JUSTICE, I COULD PICK ANOTHER AND ANOTHER, SOMEONE COULD SAY 35 YEARS AGO, TEN YEARS AGO, FIVE YEARS AGO, HE DID A HORRIBLE THING TO ME. THIS IS JUST A GAME THAT THEY ARE PLAYING. IT'S A CON GAME AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. Tucker: WE WILL CONTINUE TO COVER THE STORY ALL NIGHT TONIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND AND INTO NEXT. THERE ARE MANY STRAINS OF IT NOW. ONE THING WE LEARNED FOR CERTAIN, DEMOCRATS BADLY WANT THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY I THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY T THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY K THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY S CONTROL OF THE SUPREME COURT AND THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY . STORMY DANIELS HAS A NEW CLIENT TONIGHT, AND HER NAME IS JULIE SWETNICK. SHE ALLEGES THAT ABOUT 35 YEARS AGO, BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS PART OF A GROUP OF TEENAGE BOYS IN THE WASHINGTON, D.C., AREA WHO COMMITTED A SERIES OF GANG. KAVANAUGH HIMSELF SEEM TO BE OLDER TODAY WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE CLAIM. HE DESCRIBED IT AS BEING PART OF AN EMPHASIS, EPISODE OF THE TWILIGHT ZONE. IN THE COMING DAYS WE WILL HAVE TIME TO CAREFULLY ASSESS ALL OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE MANY COUNTERCLAIMS IN THE STORY AND WE WILL BRING ALL OF THAT TO YO YOU. BUT TONIGHT WE WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS AND SEVERAL COME TO MIND. HERE'S THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE. WHAT EXACTLY IS THEM ALLOCATION HERE IN THIS NEW CLAIM? RICHARD BLUMENTHAL DID NOT HESITATE TO GIVE HIS ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IT IS. WHAT WE HAVE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A SWORN AFFIDAVIT THAT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES BRETT KAVANAUGH AS SEEMINGLY RATING A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN DRUGGED. Tucker: SEEMINGLY SAID SENATOR BLUMENTHAL. SHE CLAIMS SOMEONE ELSE HER, AND SO WHO EXACTLY IS THIS PERSON. NONE OF THAT IS CLEAR FROM HER ACCOUNT WHICH IS DOES MORE SUGGESTING THAN IT DOES STATING. SHE DOES CLAIM THAT SHE HERSELF WAS BY A NUMBER OF BOYS. WAS IT CAVANAUGH AMONG, AMONG THEM? WE DON'T KNOW. WHICH ITSELF RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION, WHY DOESN'T HER STATEMENT SPELL OUT CLEARLY WHAT SHE CLAIMS KAVANAUGH DEAD. WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT A ACCORDING TO JULIE SWETNICK, HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPENED IN A SERIES OF PARTIES IN SUBURBAN MARYLAND IN THE 1980s. NOT TALKING DRUNKEN NAUGHTINESS, THESE ARE WAR LEVEL CLIENT CRIMES. GROUPS OF YOUNG WOMEN DRUGGED AND GANG, IT'S HORRIFYING. SO WHY HASN'T ANYONE TAKEN US TO LAW ENFORCEMENT? DID HE CONTACT A MARYLAND POLICE FIRST, THEY ARE THE ONES WITH JURISDICTION HERE. IS IT THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE SEEN THESE ALLEGATIONS? AND IF IT IS THE FIRST TIME, HOW CAN THAT BE? SHE DESCRIBES ATTENDING AT LEAST TEN PARTIES IN WHICH PUBLIC DRUGGING AND BE SEVEN TOOK PLACE. DID ANY OF THE MANY PEOPLE AT THESE RATE SCENES MENTIONED THESE CRIMES TO POLICE, THEN OR IN YEARS SENSE? WASHINGTON IS A VERY SMALL PLACE. AMONG THE PERMANENT POPULATION HERE, EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES. SO WHERE ARE ALL THE WITNESSES TO THIS? WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SPOKEN TO WITNESSES ABOUT IT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS? DID SHE OR HERSELF TELL ANYONE OVER THAT TIME? BETH WILKINSON RAISED THESE QUESTIONS TODAY. I HAVE HAD PEOPLE CALL ME AND EMAIL ME SAYING THEY KNOW HIM, THEY WERE AT THE PARTIES, THEY'VE NEVER MET HER AND NEVER SEEN HER. IF THIS WAS HAPPENING OVER TWO YEARS WITH ALL THESE WOMEN AND ALL THESE MEN, SOMEONE ELSE WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT AND WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT BY NOW. Tucker: AFFAIR QUESTIONS. WHAT'S THE ANSWER? AND BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS JULIE SWETNICK DOING AT THESE PARTIES? SHE GRADUATED IN 1980 WHICH MEANT SHE WOULD BE IN COLLEGE WHEN THE PARTY TOOK PLACE AND YET SHE WENT PARTIES TO HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. AT THESE PARTIES SHE SAW HORRIFIC RAPES, AND SHE NEVER REPORTED THEM TO POLICE. MOST BAFFLING OF ALL, HOW DID THE FBI MISSED THE FACT THAT KAVANAUGH WAS PART OF A HUGE RING? HE'S HAD SIX FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND STAFF SECRETARY, HE HAD THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SECURITY CLEARANCE, ONE THAT ALLOWED HIM ACCESS TO THIS COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR CODES. FBI AGENTS WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO HUGE VARIETY OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW OR KNEW OF AND KAVANAUGH DURING HIS HIGH SCHOOL YEARS AND YET NOT ONE OF THEM MENTIONED HE WAS A SERIAL WHO COMMITTED HIS IN ROOMS OF CLASSMATES. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? AND IF IT DID HAPPEN WE KNOW THAT FBI INVESTIGATORS ARE CRIMINALLY INCOMPETENT. SO INCOMPETENT THEY MISS A GLARING FACT LIKE THAT. SO WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO REINVEST KAVANAUGH SEVENTH TIME? MANY PEOPLE WONDER ABOUT ALL THIS, BUT NOT THE MEDIA. HOW DARE THEY ASK, THEY SOLD, QUESTIONS ARE FORBIDDEN HERE. WHEN YOU HEAR LINDSEY GRAHAM, A SITTING SENATOR SAY THINGS LIKE I FIND IT CURIOUS THAT THESE CHARGES WERE NOT BROUGHT FORWARD UNTIL 2018, COME ON. AND IT'S MORE THAN THAT HE SAID, I HOPE PEOPLE WILL BE HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE ALLEGATION BECAUSE WHY WOULD SHE GO TO TEN PARTIES, WHY WOULD SHE CONTINUE TO HANG AROUND PEOPLE LIKE THIS? IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD OF THE PEOPLE THAT ADVOCATE FOR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT, THEY CALL THIS VICTIM BLAMING. Tucker: THEY CALL IT VICTIM BLAMING, BUT IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU THINK THE VICTIM IS. DUMB PEOPLE ON TELEVISION HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS ABOUT THAT AND THEY WOULD LIKE YOU TO SHUT UP. BUT THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULD, OR AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND IT'S YOUR COUNTRY. IT'S YOUR SUPREME COURT AND YOUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT DOESN'T BELONG TO CABLE NEWS ANCHORS OR CREEPY LAWYERS OR U.S. SENATORS WHO HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE UP ON DUE PROCESS AND INSTEAD WOULD LIKE TO ROBE ACCUSATION AND SCREAMING.
