1
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:36,080
>> HE DID RESPOND TO THIS
CRITICISM.

2
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,659
SOME 
PEOPLE DID

3
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:49,140
RESPOND ON TWITTER BECAUSE IT
TOOK HIM A DAY TO RESPOND.

4
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
ONE

5
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:58,380
PERSON SAID THIS.

6
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,000
DID YOU HAVE A
REACTION WHEN YOU SAW THIS?

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,270
DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE THE
WHEREWITHAL TO FILL MYSELF IN

9
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,899
THAT SPACE.

10
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:08,899
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO
AUSCHWITZ.

11
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,890
>> IT IS JUST PULLING HER PHONE
AND FILMING SOMETHING.

12
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,890
THEY GIVE

13
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,120
YOU RULES, AND HE SEEMS TO
UNDERSTAND THERE IS A GRAVITY TO

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,370
WHERE HE IS AT.

15
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,910
HE JUST THINKS
THIS RULE DOESN'T APPLY TO HIM.

16
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,890
I SEE HIS INTENTION IS TO RAISE
SOME KIND OF AWARENESS ABOUT

17
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,890
SOMETHING.

18
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,250
THAT IS WHY THEY KEEP
AUSCHWITZ WHERE IT IS AS IT IS,

19
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,930
TO RAISE AWARENESS AND MAKE
PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THIS.

20
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,430
NOW THEY

21
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,400
ALSO SAY, HEY, IF YOU GIVE A
DAMN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE,

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,320
WE WOULD LIKE YOU NOT 
TO TALK.

23
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,430
I
THINK HE PROBABLY THOUGHT I NEED

24
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,120
TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE.

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,960
AND HE
LINKED THIS VERY REAL MURDER

26
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,569
GENOCIDE SUFFERING TO HIS JOB
WITH HOMELAND SECURITY.

27
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,569
THAT IS

28
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,569
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO LATER.

29
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:30,650
YOU
CAN COMMUNICATE THAT LATER.

30
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,650
BUT

31
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,790
RIGHT THERE ALL WE HAVE IS
DOCUMENTATION OF YOU

32
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,650
POLITICIZING THIS WHICH IS
SOMETHING THEY JUST DON'T WANT

33
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,790
YOU TO DO.

34
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,370
>> I AM NOT ONE MUCH ON
CEREMONY.

35
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,860
HE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE

36
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,150
HIS POLITICAL OPINION ON
AUSCHWITZ.

37
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,780
I'M GLAD HE CARES

38
00:03:50,780 --> 00:04:06,099
ENOUGH TO HIGHLIGHT IT IN HIS
APOLOGY.

39
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:12,110
BUT INSIDE THE GAS

40
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,420
CHAMBER TO DO A VIDEO?

41
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,089
A BIT
MUCH.

42
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,409
SO HE HAS RETRACTED IT AND

43
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,820
REALIZES HE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE
IT.

44
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,860
IF YOU MADE IT AT A LATER

45
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,979
DATE, I WOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT.

46
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:29,979
I WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE A

47
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,599
PROBLEM WITH IT IF HE DID IT
OUTSIDE AS LONG AS HE IS

48
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:36,250
RESPECTFUL OF THE RULES THERE.

49
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,159
WHAT HE TAKES AWAY FROM IT IS

50
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:45,960
NOT HUMAN RIGHTS, IT IS NOT
CARING FOR MINORITIES.

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
THOSE

52
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,490
WOULD BE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

53
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,289
HE GOES TO WE MUST PROTECT THE

54
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:55,750
HOMELAND.

55
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:05,289
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IS KIND OF
WHAT THE OTHER SIDE SAID IN

56
00:05:05,289 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT SITUATION.
