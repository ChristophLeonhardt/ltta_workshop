it's one shot

58
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,819
I thought Stefan

00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,960
make my way to ops

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,790
to bit more there but

61
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,790
the prospect to be lobster

62
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,450
nope

63
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,150
not a street guy that anyone working and

64
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,990
anything publicly

65
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,140
could be difficult

66
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,470
and school and often not that much fun

67
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,300
and I hope you do get a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> break at</font>

68
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,490
some point even if not over the next

69
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,470
couple of weeks or so

70
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,510

any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> still there like</font>

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,750

around it it smells<font color="#CCCCCC"> delicious</font>

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,160
this is like the least practical camera

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,280
to blog with unbusy in

77
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:19,190

ideas other people but no nearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

80
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,510
focus just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take my son rip</font>

81
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,100
I was being really frustrated yesterday

82
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,130
which may have noticed if you follow me

83
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">on Twitter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a bit sarcastic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

84
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,800
tend to do and but basically there was a

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,129
situation where

86
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,569
this conversation about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

87
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,139
bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> Star</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wars boilers is very soon at</font>

88
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,679
the conversation firstly I really didn't

89
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the term rarity I think it's</font>

90
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,249
outdated and it's also been it's changed

91
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:52,779
as you switch like words and phrases

92
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:54,939
often changing their use my concern is

93
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the discussion does not seem to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

94
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">so much about whether or not someone is</font>

95
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,469
a developed character whether or not

96
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:04,330
that character is has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been written well</font>

97
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,069
enough and whether or not flawless

98
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:11,230
characters in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> genre</font>

99
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,240
our good thing to learn our<font color="#CCCCCC"> battle and</font>

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,280
so on up get the bad things everyone

101
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,410
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion sees me whether</font>

102
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,530
or not ray character Ray has a right to

103
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,690
the force and her kind of interaction

104
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,970
will default but also say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple</font>

105
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">times trophic terms like with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,600
functionally waived it needs to be

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,060
dismissed<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time we simplify something</font>

108
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,610
down to a true then we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them</font>

109
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,830
in a way that think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me dismissed or</font>

110
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,550
they are worthy of dismissal sorry I'm

111
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,110
just ripping them you run over<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

112
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that they're worthy of dismissal</font>

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
in some way that we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we not</font>

114
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,010
some quick term to just listen and

115
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,470
that's why sometimes I seek for ways in

116
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,450
which we talk about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> prejudiced and</font>

117
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,820
people and arbiters of prejudice we have

118
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,800
to be very careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't package</font>

119
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,320
it in a way that is easily dismissed

120
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,120
because we should actually look at these

121
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,470
problems with more focus and more

122
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,720
