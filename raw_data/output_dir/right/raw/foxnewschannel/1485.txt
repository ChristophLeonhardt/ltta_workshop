00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:16,143
HEATHER: DONALD TRUMP SIGNING

2
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:18,480
THE RIGHT TO TRY BILL INTO LAW

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,214
WHICH OFFERS TERMINAL PATIENTS

4
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:23,018
THE CHOICE TO TRY EXPERIENTIAL

5
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:23,685
TREATMENT EVEN WITHOUT FDA

6
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:24,052
APPROVAL.

7
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:29,725
IS THIS A GOOD IDEA OR A BAD

8
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:30,259
THING FOR PATIENTS.

9
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:31,893
DR. NICOLE SAFIRE, THANK YOU FOR

10
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:34,529
JOINING US.

11
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:36,832
LET'S SHOW PEOPLE WHAT THIS

12
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:40,302
RIGHT TO TRY LAW WOULD SAY, TO

13
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:48,543
AUTHORIZE USE, DIAGNOSED WITH A

14
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:49,244
TERMINAL ILLNESS, WHAT DO YOU

15
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:49,978
THINK OF THIS IT DOES IT HAVE TO

16
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:50,545
BE A TERMINAL ILLNESS?

17
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:55,083
>> THE FDA IS AMERICA'S

18
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:55,784
WATCHDOG, KEEPS FAKE PRODUCTS

19
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:56,418
OFF THE MARKET AND UNSAFE

20
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:58,920
PRODUCTS.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,521
THE RIGHT TO TRY LAW IS

22
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,391
ESSENTIALLY MAKING SURE THOSE

23
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:06,662
WITH TERMINAL ILLNESSES WHO HAVE

24
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:07,396
NO OTHER OPTIONS HAVE ACCESS TO

25
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:10,265
DRUG COMPANIES TO HAVE

26
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:10,999
MEDICATIONS OR TREATMENTS THAT

27
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:18,006
MAY WORK BUT HAVEN'T PROVEN SAFE

28
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:18,473
THROUGH THE FDA.

29
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:19,207
WE HAVE A PROCESS LIKE THAT IN

30
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,143
PLACE BY THE FDA AND THEY

31
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:30,886
APPROVE 99% OF REQUESTS IN THESE

32
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:31,553
INSTANCES BUT THIS IS JUST

33
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:32,220
REALLY A GREAT WAY FOR THE

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,921
UNITED STATES TO SHOW WE ARE

35
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:33,622
THERE TO GIVE AMERICANS EVERY

36
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:37,125
OPTION POSSIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO

37
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:37,659
TERMINAL ILLNESSES.

38
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:38,393
HEATHER: DOES THE DRUG HAVE TO

39
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:39,094
BE IN THE PROCESS OF APPROVAL?

40
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:40,462
>> THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE PHASE

41
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:40,696
1.

42
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:42,864
AFTER PHASE I A LOT OF DRUGS

43
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:46,435
DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH FDA

44
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:46,802
APPROVAL.

45
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:50,572
THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE GETTING

46
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:51,173
THESE MEDICATIONS, AS A

47
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:51,907
PHYSICIAN WE DON'T KNOW THE SIDE

48
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:56,345
EFFECTS TO LOOK FOR THEIR SAFETY

49
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:56,678
PROFILE.

50
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:57,312
IT IS A LITTLE CONCERNING

51
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:58,046
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE

52
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:01,316
FDA IS AWARE OF THE MEDICATIONS.

53
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:05,220
HOWEVER, IN AN EMOTIONAL SENSE

54
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,954
IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF YOU OR

55
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:12,661
SOMEONE YOU LOVE, YOU WANT TO

56
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,261
GIVE THEM EVERY CHANCE.

57
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:13,962
>> THERE IS ALWAYS THAT HOPE

58
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:14,629
ISSUED TO GIVE THE PATIENT.

59
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:20,769
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NEXT ISSUE,

60
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:21,503
A WARNING TO AVOID HOMEOPATHIC

61
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,003
TEETHING PRODUCTS.

62
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:24,239
>> GO TO ANY BABY I'LL YOU WILL

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,577
SEE MEDICATIONS EQUIVALENT TO

64
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:29,311
THE ADULT ONES, ORAJEL THAT YOU

65
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,113
CAN RUB ON BABIES GUMS, THE FDA

66
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:35,984
HAS FOR YEARS PUT WARNINGS OUT

67
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:36,718
SAYING YOU DON'T TAKE THEM BUT

68
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:39,855
THEY ARE GETTING MORE SERIOUS

69
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:40,589
AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO GET THEM

70
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:43,825
OFF THE CELLS BECAUSE THERE IS A

71
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:49,264
COMPONENT IN THESE MEDICINES

72
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:49,965
THAT CAN DISPLACE OXYGEN FROM

73
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:54,870
THE CHILD'S BLOOD, FROM THE

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,270
HEMOGLOBIN.

75
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,004
THIS CAN HAPPEN IN ADULTS, BEING

76
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:56,738
A CHILD EFFECTS ARE MORE SEVERE

77
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:57,539
WITH A SMALLER AMOUNT OF

78
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:57,939
MEDICATION.

79
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,376
WHEN IT COMES TO TEETHING DON'T

80
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:09,584
USE THE NUMBING MEDICATION, GUM

81
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:09,985
MASSAGE --

82
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:10,552
BILL: WILL OUTGROW IT.

83
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:13,221
I HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT IT BUT

84
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:17,959
LEAVE IT TO TWITTER.

85
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:18,693
I STARTED SEEING SUNSCREEN PILLS

86
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:21,329
THEY ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO TAKE

87
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,565
AND IT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM

88
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:29,671
THE SUN'S RAYS BUT IT IS NOT

89
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:29,971
TRUE.

90
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:30,705
>> Reporter: YOU CANNOT REPLACE

91
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:31,273
SUNSCREEN WITH A PILL.

92
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:31,840
THEY ARE PACKED WITH

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,808
ANTIOXIDANTS WHICH ARE GREAT FOR

94
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:34,743
YOUR SKIN AND HAVE PROVEN SUN

95
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:35,477
DAMAGE EFFECTS AND PROTECT YOU

96
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:39,114
IN THE LONG TERM FROM SUN DAMAGE

97
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:39,848
BUT THEY ARE NOT PROTECTING YOU

98
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:44,686
FROM ACUTE SUN DAMAGE, GETTING

99
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:45,020
BURNED.

100
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,620
PEOPLE ARE TAKING THIS

101
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,288
MEDICATION AT NOT APPLYING

102
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:48,857
SUNSCREEN AND THAT IS A NO-NO.

103
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:50,125
HEATHER: IF YOU TAKE MEDICATION

104
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,962
MAKE SURE YOU PUT SUNSCREEN ON

105
00:03:53,962 --> 00:04:01,102
AS WELL.

106
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:01,736
LONGSLEEVED, PANTS, HATS.

107
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:02,471
HEATHER: REMEMBER THE PILLS THEY

108
00:04:02,471 --> 00:00:00,000
USED TO HAVE THAT ALLEGEDLY GAVE
