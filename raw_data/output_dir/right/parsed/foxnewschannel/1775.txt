A VERY LONG DAY OF VIOLENCE.
>> IT HAS, INDEED.
THEY HAD HOPED THEY WOULDN'T
COME OUT IN THE NUMBERS THEY
DID BUT THEY DID.
IN FACT, THIS WAS THE MOST
VIOLENT DAY WE HAVE SEEN HERE
ON THE BORDER SINCE THE WAR OF
2014.
WE ARE JUST 90 MINUTES SOUTH
OF YOU BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE A
DIFFERENT WORLD.
ALL DAY WE HEARD GUNFIRE, LONG
VOLLEYS OF GUNFIRE.
WE SAW AIRSTRIKES TAKING PLACE
IN GAZA.
WE SAW THICK BLACK SMOKE WHERE
THEY WERE BURNING THE TIRES
AND WE SAW TEAR GAS DROPPED ON
THE PROTESTERS TRYING TO
DISBURSE THEM.
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.
IT HAS QUIETED DOWN NOW BUT
EARLIER THERE WERE TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS UP AND
DOWN THE BOARDER IN A VARIETY

BREACH THE FENCE TO GET INTO
ISRAEL AND THEY HAD TO BE
PUSHED BACK.
THEY SAY ONCE YOU HAVE CROSSED
THE FENCE IT'S JUST A
FIVE-MINUTE RUN TO THE NEAREST
VILLAGES.
THAT IS WHERE THEY WERE HAVING
TO PROTECT.
WE SAW AIRSTRIKES CARRIED OUT
HERE AND THEY ARE CARRIED OUT
ON HAMAS CAMPS.
I.D.F. WARNED HAMAS IF IT
ESCALATED THEY WOULD RESPOND
IN THIS WAY AND THAT IS WHAT
THEY DID.
THEY USED DRONES TO DROP TEAR
GAS.
52 DEAD SO FAR.
2,300 AT LEAST INJURED AND WE
EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO CONTINUE
RISING.
TOMORROW IS THE DAY THEY THEY
MOURN THE CREATION OF THE
STATE OF ISRAEL.
TOMORROW IS THE BIG DAY.
AND IT MAY BE BIGGER.
BUT TODAY THEY CAME OUT IN
PROTEST AGAINST THE OPENING OF
THE EMBASSY.
A BIGGER DAY THAN WE
ANTICIPATED.
I.D.F. SAID NO ISRAELIS WERE
WOUNDED OR KILLED AND SO IT
HAS BEEN A SUCCESS.
WE EXPECT TOMORROW MORE TO
TAKE PLACE.
THE HAMAS LEADER HAD SAID THE
PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE FENCE
WOULD BE UNARMED AND PEACEFUL
BUT SAID THEY WOULD BE LIKE A
