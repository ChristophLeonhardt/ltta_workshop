president Kofi Fei our beloved troll in chief has reportedly requested a military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue for either Memorial Day or Independence Day or Veterans Day the left and anti-trump Republicans historically ignorant frequently wrong but never in doubt insists that honoring our military is unprecedented and will destroy the Republic we will analyze the illustrious history of military parades in the United States and how Trump should stage it then Elisha Kraus and Ariel Davidson joined to discuss breaking news last night Fox News released a shocking report on texts between FBI agents Peter struck and Lisa page showing that James Comey former FBI director ordered the two agents to prepare an update on ongoing investigations because quote POTUS wants to know everything we're doing which shows that Barack Obama was lying through his teeth surprise surprise when he said on national television that he did not interfere with the Attorney General or FBI directors about pending investigations then variations on a theme trey Gowdy has all but admitted that the source of information passed to Hillary's State Department to be passed to dossier Arthur Christopher Steele to be passed to Barack Obama's FBI was none other than Clinton hatchet man Sidney Blumenthal meaning that the entire Russia collusion investigation circus may have likely been a charade funded orchestrated and executed by Clinton cronies to undermine Trump's campaign shocking isn't it and in the most important news Canada's Prime Minister Ken doll Justin Trudeau wants to change the word mankind to people kind because he's illiterate I'm Michel Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show that's a lot that's a lot to get to there is so much and this is very important because everybody is so dead certain they're making these great historical claims and they don't really know anything about what they're talking about so we'll clear that up a little bit but first look you know youyou

know you already died from tax reform and deregulation and moving our embassy and Israel to the capital of Israel and appointing an originalist to the Supreme Court and reinstituting the Mexico City policy and pulling out of the Paris climate Accord you zombie you undead drone wandering through the world suffering death after death but relentlessly existing the new mainstream media hysteria is that President Trump wants to have a military parade I wish I had pearls on like a clutch and grits so horrible here is Rear Admiral John Kirby who was the State Department spokesman under Barack Obama explaining why he hates the parade idea so Admiral Kirby what do you think of the idea of a military parade in Washington I don't like it al so not not at all this is not about showcasing our millet this is about the president showing off this is all about his ego and that's just an inappropriate use of military time and talent and resources and the week the second thing is this is beneath us as a nation we are the most powerful military on earth we're very proud of that and rightly so we don't need to be parade in our military hardware down Pennsylvania Avenue to to show that to anybody and thirdly I think it's just a waste of resources it will cost millions of dollars that's money that can be put to other better uses operations training not to mention just even just taking care of our people spouse education programs that kind of thing so I think this is just a it's a it's a tremendously bad idea the trouble with a curt of this analysis kirby comes out he says this isn't what we do in america it's okay we like the military but we don't parade our our troops down the streets we don't need to show other people our tanks or our missiles it's unamerican it's what people do in other countries and dictatorships and and the military hates it in the country hates it and we've never seen it before and it's awful the trouble with that analysis and I've heard this repeated ad nauseam all morning is that it isn't true people I understand people say if it reminds me of Soviet Russia oh it reminds me of the North Korea okay yes it were places have military parades - the United States has regularly paraded soldiers and tanks and missiles through the streets of the capital and other cities for over 150 years just a quick history of these after the Civil War President Andrew Johnson held a military parade of a hundred 45,000 Union soldiers parading down Pennsylvania Avenue the procession known as the grand review of the armies took place over two days May 23rd and 24th three years and six days before the first Memorial Day was celebrated after World War one the u.s. held military parades in New York DC countless other cities to greet doughboys as they returned from the battlefield that's what that's what sweet little ISA calls me by the way is a Doughboy I don't think it's for the same reason General Black Jack Pershing led at the parade of thousands of soldiers through the streets of New York on September 10th 1919 and then he led another parade of thousands of soldiers through the streets of DC about a week later we also had military parades in 1942 and 1946 the 1942 parade in New York lasted for more than 11 hours it was attended by two million people that parade even featured a gigantic bust of Franklin Roosevelt of the President they pulled a gigantic head of FDR down the the street in the 1942 parade and and yet we are told to have a little military parade in America today would be awful it would be Trump becoming a dictator as far as I can tell the current preparations don't include a gigantic Trump head on a float but who knows things could change in 1946 a military parade was held in New York to celebrate the Allied victory in World War two the 1946 parade saw some of the largest self-propelled howitzers in the entire army rolling down the streets of New York tanks rolling down the streets of New York in 1953 at President Eisenhower's first inauguration another event where we're commemorating a guy where we're commemorating the inauguration there were 73 bands 59 floats and lots of military assets including an 85 ton atomic cannon that could fire a shell 20 miles tanks as far as the eye could see rolled through Washington guess what happened four years later and again this this wasn't to celebrate a particular victim or this wasn't to celebrate something else other than this guy's inauguration and Eisenhower his second inauguration thousands of troops marched three miles down Washington with countless tanks rolling along side plus the 69 foot long red stone which was the first ballistic missile successfully fired by the United States missiles tanks thousands and thousands of troops all marching down the road four years later so we had 53 57 now in 1961 at JFK's inauguration dozens of missiles were paraded in front of the world including the Nike Zeus which was the first missile that could intercept ballistic missiles so we're being told now by the left and Trump critics and former Obama administration officials we we don't need to show our military equipment off we would never do that it would be such a step backward so small-minded of the United States if we ever showed off our military equipment we've been doing it for well over regularly we did 53 3761 we did and four year intervals for a while and that's not just missiles during the JFK parade even huge Navy boats were towed down Pennsylvania Avenue with Kennedy aboard waving to the throngs on boats that specifically resembled the one that he himself commanded in World War two in more recent history in 1991 President George HW Bush held a massive military parade in Washington here's the coverage then good evening well already they are saying tonight it was the biggest military celebration in the nation's capitol since World War two as Washington today honored the US servicemen and women who fought in the Gulf War both those who returned and those who died 200,000 enthusiastic spectators watched a parade of troops in their weapons all part of the national victory celebration Eric enge Burton has our report it was a day for saying thank you to heroes the president choked back tears several times as he spoke directly to loved ones of those who died on the wide boulevards just a few blocks from the White House 8,000 Desert Storm troops were moving out and once again it was general Norman Schwarzkopf who set the cadence leading the way as far as the presidential box where he spent the rest of the parade as cheerleader and spotter for a clearly delighted George Bush so much military hardware was moving that at times it appeared Washington was under attack well here justice I thank you and to celebrate our victory but to say thank you to all the men and women who serve in the armed forces now I think that this is a wonderful occasion but we don't want it to happen again we don't wonderful and of course that's the sentiment we don't want war we don't want but we want to honor the the service and the sacrifice of our troops tanks rolling through Washington DC we're now being told that the streets would all crack if we if we drove tanks down them we've done this plenty of times and it's just fine it looked like Washington was under attack but that's what these parades look like so after that were after the Persian Gulf War Iraq part 1 tributes were held nearly every day to welcome home troops though the largest celebrations were held in New York and DC yes there's plenty of precedent for this don't get that out of your mind nevertheless many leftist commentators still object Douglas Brinkley a presidential historian and insufferable lefty said on CNN quote I don't think there's a lack of love and respect for our armed forces in the United States give me a break but we'll get to that later what what are they going to do stand there while Donald Trump waves at them it smacks of something you see in a totalitarian country unless there's a genuine earnest reason to be doing it now the historian Wilfred McClay observed in 2006 that Douglas Brinkley has failed to quote put forward a single memorable idea a single original analysis or a single lapidary phrase likewise the author Bill Bryson has called Brinkley a minor American academic and sometime critic whose powers of observation and generosity of spirit would fit comfortably into a proton and still leave room for an echo absolutely right even the sentiment is totally wrong and even on the historical points he's making they're just not true at the White House for its part also rejects the notion that a military parade is totalitarian saying that it would be a celebration of the men and women who give us freedom who protect our freedom that's the opposite of a totalitarian government they say and that's true brinkley says we should only have parades when there's a genuine earnest reason to be doing it sure now by the way this wasn't always the case in the century we had three back-to-back four years four years four years that were not being done earnestly to celebrate some war victory or something though clearly there was a strategic purpose it was to frighten our enemies it was to frighten the Soviet Union just as today we have enemies that we could reasonably frighten and show off our bigger buttons that's exactly why though that there has been a groundswell and support in recent years for a military parade at like the one we're talking about to honor veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan why shouldn't we honor them the last military parade we held in Washington was to honor the veterans of the last major war we concluded but the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who served their country admirably after the September 11th terrorist attacks they've never had their own parade they've never had that moment that's why even Chuck Schumer has called for this parade in 2014 Schumer held a press conference and I know this is shocking because the most dangerous place in the world as we all know is not in the Middle East on the fighting grounds or in the air or on the sea it's the space between Chuck Schumer in a television camera I digress Schumer held a press conference on Broadway at Bowling Green right by statues of George Washington where Washington gave his farewell to the Troops and he said with the war in Afghanistan winding down now is the time to keep with long-standing American tradition and kick off a campaign for the first New York City welcome home parade for troops that served in Iraq and Afghanistan for the first that implies multiple parades that he's suggesting he goes on with the completion of the Afghanistan combat mission expected at the end of this year and with Iraq's official and far behind us it's time for New York to stake its claim and for the Department of Defense to join in planning this welcome home celebration then joining the chorus of calls for a military parade to honor those veterans came none other than New York's Bolshevik Mayor Bill DeBlasio even Bill DeBlasio said quote the brave men and women who have selflessly served our nation with courage and skill in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve a recognition for this sacrifice I stand with Senator Schumer in his call for a parade to honor our veteran heroes and New York City would be proud to host this important event I'm glad we all agree I'm glad you agree Chuck and I'm glad you bill and I fully expect you to keep your mouth shut well president Trump plans the new one so what happened why no parade there's a point here there's no parade because the war in Afghanistan was still basically in full swing by that time 75% of US casualties in Afghanistan had occurred under Barack Obama's watch that was in 2015 2014-2015 Barack Obama who insisted on restarting a war that we'd already won because he had to balance out his vocal criticism of the Iraq war which he recklessly chose to lose because his opposition to Iraq was central to his winning the Democratic nomination over Hillary Clinton the Defense Department under Barack Obama filter would not look good to host a parade for military veterans until the war in Afghanistan was completed the trouble is that our current operations in Afghanistan have increasingly become a stabilizing mission what might be called a war of empire so they're still fighting but the fear of pulling US troops out is that the country will then fall into disarray again and provide a safe haven for terrorists who have to go right back in and we know is already doing that for the years before September 11th which is the reason we had to intervene in the first place so if that's the kind of war that we're engaged in then there can be no clear moment of victory no mission accomplished banner it might look like Korea you know we've had Korea and we've had troops stationed in Korea to prevent the outbreak of new violence for 61 years Afghanistan is the longest war we have ever engaged in 16 years and counting number one on the list after that and that's followed by the Moro rebellion which is a word that absolutely no one knows about it was one in which Muslim tribes living in the southern Philippines attacked US troops after the US government had told them that they would continue their old protectorate relationship with Spain we got bogged down into that rebellion for 14 years that's followed by the Northwest Indian War at 10 years the Iraq war at 8.8 revolutionary war at a point for Vietnam and 8.1 the Second Seminole War at 6.7 the first Barbary war at 4.1 the Civil War at four and world war ii at 3.7 it's interesting to note that a full forty percent of those wars possibly more if you count the war against isis separately a full 40 percent of the longest wars in US history have been defending against Muslim forces something that isn't talked about very much and it's a strange quirk of US history now that is by no means a list of the deadliest wars in US history that list goes Civil War World War 2 World War 1 Vietnam Korea the revolution 1812 Mexican American War Iraq and Afghanistan combined as one conflict in the philippine-american war so what do we do about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan part of the reason we haven't had a parade is that they've been so politicized by the left since the beginning and we might keep troops in Afghanistan for decades we might not pull all of them out right away so can we honor the veterans who signed up to protect our freedom after the worst terrorist attack on American soil on September 11 2001 we have parades and demonstrations for a lot of other things I'll just refresh your memory of the last year pussy hats gay pride Superbowl here a lot of parades actually that Super Bowl parade I think it's just when they torched Philadelphia but that's a separate demonstration is it really so awful to celebrate and thank our troops reports indicate the president Trump is considering hosting the parade on Memorial Day or the 4th of July or Veterans Day not on a random Tuesday not just when on his birthday or something like that there if all of the reports say he's got those dates picked out for the parade of the three Veterans Day seems like the best time to me that's a time when we're already honoring the troops fourth of July celebrates the fanning of our country Veterans Day seems like the right way to do it if it's done right not only will it not be an unprecedented threat to the Republic or whatever they're saying it is it will be admirable and long overdue comfortable Americans have had the privilege of keeping war out of their minds for the most part since 9/11 because of the brave men and women who answered the call of duty and defended our freedom overseas a parade through the streets of Washington DC to honor them if done right could go a long way toward focusing Americans attention on just what our country has been doing in Iraq and Afghanistan and to remind us that our freedom doesn't come free but instead has been purchased at a high cost that we are so privileged in this country that most of the time we don't even have to notice that cost and Donald Trump in suggesting this military parade which is in well keeping with us tradition seems to be provoking the left into attacking our military like lunatics it's a it's a really bad look for them Donald Trump is very good at at putting his adversaries into a corner and making them defend the indefensible making their true colors shine through it looks like what's happening here fine by me seems like a lot of good things are being accomplished in it okay we've got to get to our panel we have a lovely panel today it's it's an old ladies panel it's much more beautiful than we usually have we have Jacob we pluck him off the sidewalks or something you know all ladies

me Marshall also took Ariel away from me but that's fine that means that I get Alicia all to myself today I thought I was gonna have to wait until the conversation but I get Alicia all to myself Alicia thank you for being here of course Thanks so the first thing I need your thoughts what do you think about this parade I gotta say reading the report at first I was kind of like yeah and then I really came to the conclusion that you did I'm a child of the 80s and I remember proper and like marching after Operation Desert Storm as you mentioned I also remember me reading the generals biography and I think it's the first time I'd asked my mom what the F word was because there was lots of those most military books my generals I remember reading for scums a biography but I think that I think that really these things exist I mean I have friends that were recently at the Rose Bowl you have flyovers you know the national anthem you've the beautiful flag displays on the field these things already kind of exist so I have mixed feelings on it I think that it is okay to show support of the military I think that it is important to especially after the horrible way that our Vietnam veterans were treated coming home from Vietnam to continue to show past present and military members and service men and women our appreciation for them but I think that you know as a trump sometimes skeptic I also get how some people jumped to the oh god he's Mussolini he's Mussolini he's Mussolini who's kim jeong-hoon it just adds fodder to like the the argument that he is this evil dictator Donald and and I think that he needs to be very careful not to play into this and I have to say I'm a fan of Sarah Huckabee Sanders but today I listened to the press conference that she did live and her answers to this were very vague and very unclear and I think that they just need to come out swinging with their talking points of this is what the president meant this is who it came from this is the purpose for it and we're looking into options but when they don't answer direct questions it feeds into the negative narrative that's right and I think there is a little bit here of Chesterton's the thought that stops thought I think a lot of people that the society is so postmodern we've questioned so much of even our own institutions even the premises of our government of our society that now in the fashionable elites circles military services taboo it so it's so not nice those men they shoot guns sometimes they shoot them at brown people that's what let's forget about that we don't we can't acknowledge that but of course the military of the guys who defend our freedom there are a lot of people who don't like our freedom and our government and they want to attack us and it is important I think to remember especially in an era where something like 1% of the country has ever served in the military 1 2 3 % that we remind ourselves that the reason that we can have lovely political debates and make art and movies and write books and in my case not write books like books yeah write blank books and have a nice life is because there are rough men out there who were shooting guns on our behalf and keeping the bad guys away that that's absolutely right they're gonna say it's fascism but they say everything with Trump is fascism they say that deregulation is fascism I don't know how they got to that okay so again variations on a theme there were new FBI texts that are exposing these are unbelievable because it gets to Barack Obama in typical Trump fashion the president tweeted quote new FBI texts are bombshells it all caps of course the new texts show FBI agent Peter struck I pronounce extrinsic because it's like 75 consonants and no syllables telling fellow agent Lisa Paige that FBI director James Comey wanted them to prepare an update on investigations because quote POTUS wants to know everything we're doing that's the same POTUS you'll remember who said on national television that he would never participate in or politicize any agency investigation here's Barack Obama I do not talk to the Attorney General about pending investigations I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations they we have a strict line and always have maintained it for those presidents just a button this up I guarantee it you I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department or the FBI not just in this case but in any case and she will all stop period and she will be treated no Deron seed full stop nobody gets treated differently when it comes to the Justice Department because nobody is above the law even if she ends up as the Democratic how many time do I have to say Chris guarantee I guarantee you how many times strive to say it how many times . . barack obama is so good at looking like the president and looking like he's telling the truth and he's so good at playing except he isn't he's this corrosive corrupt awful figure who really did significant harm to the country and to the government lying to your face and saying i am putting all my credibility on the line . . alicia is this proof positive that barack obama may have been lying not may have other things that he misled and blatantly lied about to the american people iran deal anyone it in the bible but we would call this a crock of crap because you can't you know that's the closest to a curse where it is i can get this language we ever have on this show and i think that is a crock of crap and good for chris wallace there i think of it if it had been a more friendly interview we wouldn't have that soundbite all these years later and in addition to this this this text messages between these FBI lovers by the way saying hey the director wants us to keep him apprised of what's happening so he can tell the commander in chief the President of the United States what's up means 1 the obama administration knew in addition to that they probably were they aware of the fusion gps thing were they aware of this dossier were way they were of how the FISA warrant was obtained i think any reporter worth their grain of salt who gets an opportunity to talk to Barack and Michelle Obama even though they've left the White House should definitely bring that up and loose lips sink ships these are just the loose text messages that we happen to see about this that they happen to write down very stupidly I mean you should never send a text or an email that you're not comfortable having on the cover of the New York Times but they just let these ones go what what aren't we see what what was going to there has to be other communications and there has to be emails and I want to see this the broad brush of the timeline of what was happening with the white house what was happening during the Clinton and Trump campaigns and what was happening during the investigation at this time with these now memos and emails and text messages and everything that we're going to see as they're opened up to the American public so we now see the Barack Obama himself all the way up to the president was inserting himself into what should have been independent agency investigations during the 2016 campaign investigations that pertained to Hillary Clinton we have a lot of evidence that the initial Russia investigation was triggered by Democrat money by Democrat operatives some with ties to the Clintons does all of this taken together all of this rancid stench from Barack Obama's politicized agencies does it undermine the mulher investigation I think unfortunately it does and I think that you know obviously and I think that the United States should take very seriously and I think that Trump shouldn't take it so personally that there's this investigation into Russia's meddling and there are two separate things it's did Russia metal in the investigation and I'm sorry in the election probably but that doesn't mean that they necessarily meddled in it for the purpose of Trump winning they just did it because they spy on everybody and everything they've been doing it forever Russians have been screwing us for a long time that is a very serious problem that our securities and our departments and all of the bureaucracy of government should be make sure you know people cannot meddle in our elections but I think that it also does undermine the separate investigation of you know is Trump involved with Russia and is he really a liaison to Vladimir Putin and all these ranchers in Canada is this mentoring candidate excetera I will flatly say though that Carter Paige I mean there's some shady stuff there whether or not Donald Trump knew about it I'm gonna err on the side of no he didn't and maybe once they found out that's why he left the campaign or maybe because he's just a shady McShane derson they had him kicked out of the campaign even before they knew too many of his involvement and stuff with the Kremlin but I think that unfortunately for Hillary Clinton for the Democrats going forward specifically in 2018 midterms in 2020 when you know that this is what they wanted to take and run with it President Trump it's gonna look as if the molar investigation is jeopardized by all of this stuff that's happening within the FBI and the DOJ absolutely it's inevitable even if Muller really is this man of integrity even the struck the most upstanding citizen in the room it just looks awful we know it has association with all of this Democrat hacker it's really no good I sort of feel for the guy but they they have to wrap this up it's just and who knows but some people are saying Donald Trump has to release everything you don't have to release everything he should he should absolutely not release everything he should hold all of his leverage as long as he can drip drip drip and let Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama sweat and on that point trey Gowdy has now all but admitted that the source of information passed a Hillary State Department to be passed to dossier author Christopher steel to be passed back to Barack Obama's FBI was Clinton hatch a man Sid Blumenthal that means the entire Russia collusion investigation circus it could have been funded it could have been a charade funded orchestrated and executed by Clinton cronies to undermine Trump's campaign Alicia if gaudi's suggestion is true does the FBI investigation into Trump Russia collusion blah blah blah do any of these have credibility do some of them have credibility but not all of them how do we parse this it's so confusing that my head is in this every day and sometimes I need to think okay wait no we're talking about this one we're not talking about this one oh gosh all the names all of the details all of the warrants all of the drama I mean even all of the congressmen involved at this point you have get trade Goudy that's come out and said this but then you also have Nunez that wrote the the GOP you know memo about this memo gate of what what was said and how the dossier was used to obtain the FISA warrant etc and let's just say when it comes to congressmen I think that I'm really inclined to believe a trey Gowdy / a Devin Nunez I think that Gowdy has a history of a prosecutor he is very good when it comes to QA he's he's shown that over and over again I'm so sad he's not running for re-election and so when Gowdy implies that Sidney Blumenthal who is known as you mentioned to be Hillary Clinton's hatchet man even after by the way the Obama administration and President Obama specifically told her when she was at the Department of State that they didn't want her working with good old she went around the Obama administration's back and kept doing it of course I believe this to be true mainly because it's coming from trade at Goudy but also because it totally fits into the timetable image narrative and the personality traits of the Clintons yep do you think people will go to jail for this or are they just all gonna get off clean like the Clintons always seem to do I think the latter unfortunately it seems as if anybody with the name and money whether it's in politics or Hollywood tends to get away with things that you and I never could or would that is true sad sad to quote a great man finally the most important story of the day Canada's ken-doll prime minister Justin Trudeau he now wants to change the word mankind to people kind to make it less sexist here is Prime Minister kendall maternal love is the love that's going to change the future of mankind so we'd like you to look we would like to say people kind not necessarily mankind so just to clarify for Prime Minister Kendall and anyone in the audience who has never looked at an Oxford English Dictionary the word man can be gender neutral it is a gender-neutral word in the Bible it is clearly written in the beginning God created man both male and female he created them created man both male and female how dare you use the Bible my patriotic a book written by a big Jewish man in the sky outrageous outrageous by the way I'm because I'm such a political nerd if I ever which I never will sorry mom I never will run for office I would want and be a representative on the federal level I would want to be called Congressman Krause because turns out like for that very reason that you mentioned male can man can be male or female and in Robert's Rules of Order it's supposed to be them the man this congresswoman stuff is crap every single time I see it this is the most sensible thing that's been said on my show all day maybe all year this is so it's so Elementary except we don't study anything nobody studies grammar or language nor anything that was written more than three seconds ago and not texted is political correctness making us all stupid or is this is this a failure of education and how do you fix it of course it's a failure of Education I mean I just wrench in Robert's Rules of Order and it's educated as an awesome as you're the majority of your audience is I guarantee you they haven't had it oh my god they're all of my audience lives in the 19th century and puffs on pipes and cigars you are right most people have no idea what Robert's rusev or order is yeah they don't understand how the three branches of government work and it's the reason everybody freaked out after you know Donald Trump actually became president they don't understand the importance of those branches of states rights of the basics you know principles of the Constitution or you know basic grammar which listen I am no grammar queen I'm awful at it been often subtweet Smee and corrects my grammar within my hundred forty or 280 character tweets that's fine I get it hashtag homeschooled but there are basic things that have not been taught in in our schools for generations and now it's going to continue to get worse because they're more worried about hay saying Z versus he so they don't offend you know less than 1% percent of the student body it is also a crime in some ways it's a it's an epidemic that's growing because more people are writing more frequently now we're all texting constantly rather than writing a letter or two per day or dictating or something so it's just infecting all of the culture this terrible grammar and writing and abusive language which is political correctness it's an abusive language my question with Trudeau I've often said that if Trudeau did not exist we would have to invent him his is Justin Trudeau Prime Minister Kendall is he trolling us he's you know when he goes down the little short-shorts waving the gay flag easy a cynical politician or is he really the doe-eyed dumb-dumb that he appears no he's definitely like a mix I don't know that he's yes the answer is yes but I think what you asked osya cynical politician errs he is delighted as he appears I think it's a mix of both I think that the doe-eyed miss is potentially part of his cynicism and he projects that because he knows that it helps his socialist you know Canada voters it helps him not the whole of the country of Canada by the way there's lots of really great Canadian conservatives and I know that they watch religiously and all these podcasts over here at the Daily wire so you know I really like y'all's maple syrup that's true the greatest living stand-up comedian Norm Macdonald is very Canadian there you go there's lots of amazing comics but like please keep Trudeau don't let that seep into the United States as Ben likes to call him the better-looking Bernie Sanders y'all can keep him I hope you vote him out because you deserve better absolutely right I just I only want him to exist from afar magazine covers waving the flags and the little short despots when he opens his mouth with the trouble exactly we want to be able to point and laugh you don't want to have to take responsibility for it absolutely right okay well that's it I guess if I want to have any political success I got to start working and become a big hunk like him if we're gonna fight this just wait for it people man has thinner legs than I do that is true we've got the conversation coming up more sweetly you will see soon for yourself you're gonna you're in for a treat we did the early shoot a couple days ago and it's a feast for the eyes you're gonna we're gonna have some of the audience just spooning out their minds I like blinding themselves okay that's a show Alicia thank you for being here very illuminating that's it that is all of it I hope I hope that you can now spread a little bit of knowledge to these historically ignorant lefties who tell you it's unprecedented and kill make sure you collect those leftist tears
