a bitterly cold spate of global warming has struck the East Coast freezing harbors and blanketing whole cities under its swell tree frost according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration this bomb cyclone occurs when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass and despite the intense name the phenomenon is actually quite common particularly in the northern Atlantic regions but forget all that science mumbo-jumbo the mainstream media have wasted no time in identifying the clear culprit behind the frigid cold front man caused global warming now because weather is weather not climate except when it's convenient for Democrats in which case the weather becomes the climate we will analyze this bitterly cold global warming with former MIT atmospheric physicist and catastrophic climate change skeptic Richard linson then this day in history I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show we have a lot to talk about today we've got to analyze the bomb cyclone I can't wait to get to Richard Lin's and we're gonna bring them on right at the top the end this day in history but first before we can do any of that we got to keep the lights on in this place so we have to thank rain ring is some pretty amazing technology rings mission is to make neighborhoods safer so you've probably seen this all your cool friends who have like cool houses and stuff might have this it's that video doorbell so that when you ring the bell they can just see you on their cell phones from wherever they are and they can answer and talk back to you so today over a million people use the amazing ring video doorbell to help protect their homes ring knows that home security begins at the front door but it doesn't end there so now they're extending that same level of security to the rest of your home with the ring floodlight cam for most of my viewers and listeners you'll know what a floodlight cam is because when you're trying to break into somebody's house that's the light that shoots on and catches you and then you scurry away in fear well now a good law-abiding homeowners will be able to see you when you do that because even if the bad guys try to steal your doorbell or steal the floodlight camera that video will be uploaded straight to the cloud people will already see it you can catch the bad guys you can see and speak to visitors even set off an alarm right from your phone and that is HD video that's two-way audio lets you know the moment anyone steps onto your property with rings floodlight camera when things go bump in the night or when you go bump in the night you will immediately know what it is whether you're home or away the ring floodlight camera lets you keep an eye on your home from anywhere it is the ultimate in home security remember in the old days they used to have the neighborhood watch and you'd send then people would still rob your neighborhoods all the time this is the 21st century get with the 21st century these are amazing price points for incredible technology it is the ultimate so there is high visibility flood lights powerful HD camera put security in your hands I know they did an experiment in a bad neighborhood of La they gave out a bunch of ring technology and they saw within six months of 55 percent decrease in Homburg that is incredible plus it's like something out of the Jetsons so be sure to go get it right now today you can save up to $150 off of a ring security kit when you go to ring.com slash knowles Kayano wles that is ring comm slash knowles what is it Marshall slash anoles that's the one okay so I've got family back on the East Coast in the bomb cyclone of global warming things are looking pretty bad here are just a few photos of it here you can see Niagara Falls is freezing as the water molecules prepare themselves to evaporate into the broiling atmosphere you can see some shoppers and Dumbo Brooklyn or E or they're actually ignoring that do not cross signs as they race across the street to escape the Blazing Sun and speaking of Brooklyn another trendy Brooklyn ID is donning half of a snorkel in her tropical paradise a tractor sweeps the bubbling asphalt off of the main drag in Bellport New York and look at this a despondent puppy in Bryant Park begs his owner to trim his coat just a little bit shorter if only there weren't so much man cause global warming three beach Bros cruise Main Street Medford New York on jet skis boy oh boy that man cause global warming really is unbelievable to help us explain the situation we now bring on Richard Linson Richard is an atmospheric physicist specializing in the dynamics of the middle atmosphere atmospheric tides and ozone photochemistry all things about which I know absolutely nothing he has published more than 200 scientific papers and books he is the recipient of many awards including the American Meteorological Society 's meisinger and Charney awards probably mispronouncing that the american geophysical union z' massal wayne metal and the leo prize from the Wallen foundation in g√∂teborg sweden he is a member of countless climate science advisory boards and until 2013 Richard worked for 30 years as the Alfred P Sloan professor of meteorology at MIT has that for an introduction Richard thank you for being here pleasure being with you Michael so Richard in September even the Washington Post where as you might have read too reseed eyes in darkness they reported on a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience adjusting the settled science of global warming Pravda on the Potomac reports quote a team of ten researchers led by Richard Miller of the University of Oxford recalculated the carbon budget for limiting the Earth's warming to one and a half degrees Celsius 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above temperatures seen in the late 19th century it had been widely assumed that this stringent target would prove unachievable but the new study would appear to give us much more time to get our act together if we want to stay below it what this paper means is that keeping warming to one and a half degrees Celsius still remains a geophysical possibility contrary to quite widespread belief Miller said in a news briefing professor linson why does the so-called settled science keep changing well obviously it's not settled whether it's equally true that there are certain problems with these hyped up statements I mean if you think about it a little bit you know the temperature has already gone up since the 19th century by about a degree this has been a period of the greatest advances in human welfare in history why do we suddenly feel that the next 1/2 degree is the end of the world it makes no sense whether we'll go above that or not I have no idea but I'm almost sure that its consequences would be fairly minimal and you know you make a great point that whenever we're talking about this climate debate will the temperature go up another degree or half a degree or one and a half degrees we're ignoring the the greatest advances in human prosperity in the history of the world were ignoring the Industrial Revolution you know many distinguished scientists including yourself reject the so-called climate consensus pushed by politicians we saw 16 scientists sign that Wall Street Journal article in 2012 arguing the decarbonizing the world economy with severely hamper economic growth quality of life especially in the third world that it's not justified by the scientific evidence and yet people with little to no scientific training reject all of you highly credentialed scientists as climate deniers has the world turned upside down on what should be a scientific issue I suppose you could say that I mean you know the 97% is a curious thing I mean it's the number that they've decided on that will convince people as you say you don't know anything about subject I wouldn't say anyone I mean what I find for example is if I you know talk to my plumber or electrician or anyone like that they don't take this seriously I'm pretty sure people in what we refer to as flyover country don't take it seriously I think the only people who take it seriously are people who went to college who don't understand science are worried about it and are reassured if somebody tells them however falsely that 97% agree and they're comforted and they feel oh that's fine they never check what the 97% refers to I mean one of the studies was asking people you know as the climate warmed since the last 150 years and his man played any role in it whatever you know everyone who works and it would agree you know both those statements so probably are correct they have no catastrophic implication but they leave it to people to assume that means the end of the world is nigh others have done all sorts of other fudges but the truth of the matter is that probably if you asked weather forecasters media weather forecasters it's always been over half don't think there's anything remarkable happening that number as you say seems perfectly tuned to be used by politicians and demagogues in the media to convince people that something terrible is happening and your statement on people who are doing jobs who maybe they don't have a bachelor's degree or they didn't go to somebody late school in the United States they're not terribly worried they're not screaming for their family's welfare and saying oh no who-who cares about how much money we're making and how our investments are doing and whether we can put the kids to college global warming is going to kill us all it seems evidence of an age-old truth that a little learning is a dangerous thing because if you asked any of my classmates at college or a many any college student today in the United States they would call you crazy yeah I think that's true but you know think about what education is about I mean you know unfortunately have come to the conclusion that for the most part what a good student it refers to as a student who has learned to rationalize anything in order to please the professor that's a maybe a useful skill in some instances but it will certainly lead you astray when you're confronted by something fairly absurd and your special ability is you can rationalize it that's a great point Allan bloom wrote about the tenor of college students in the closer of American mind he said the nice the the best thing you could say about them is that they're nice and that is a damning indictment and speaking of the university speaking of academic life scientific careers from what I have read have been ruined for contradicting global warming orthodoxy I read about - Maurice Albee American atmospheric physicist who is a so-called climate dissenter seems that he was fired by Macquarie University for his views the university even canceled a non-refundable return ticket from his European speaking engagement he all because he has dissented is there is it fair to say that there are professional incentives toed the line on global warming in the Academy of course of course there are I mean Murray's case is really sad he's a very good atmospheric scientist and they not only did everything you said but you know that they prohibited him access to his papers and everything is absolutely Stalinist his entire career at GMAT of photographs maybe yeah I mean it is that sort of thing truly bizarre I would say if you're a young scientist and don't have tenure this will kill you if you dissent if you are still active and senior you'll still be cut off from funding so yeah sure it's more than an incentive and for university administration's the the fact that this has become a matter of student activism that students somehow feel that they are displaying their virtue by condemning co2 which happens to be vital for life I mean yeah it's a bit crazy but nothing frightens an administrator more than an activist student an excellent point and did you yourself feel protected a bit you were well ensconced well established nationally and at MIT I know I spoke to Harvey Mansfield the tenured philosopher at Harvard who said that once he got tenure he felt he could raise a little hell did you think you were protected in a way that younger or less established professors were not of course of course you know it's supposed to be the purpose of tenure to give you the freedom to pursue the truth in whatever way you can on the other hand that is less important today than it used to be because your position at the university depends very critically on your ability raise funds and that in turn means everyone including senior people have an immense incentive to toe the line and you know it's always been known that this is a danger especially in science and especially in a science like atmospheric physics or climate where the government has a virtual monopoly on support and in the government oh yeah that's the point if they have a position then that's going to be a real limitation on freedom of inquiry and in terms of this they have this monopoly and they have an agenda they fund all of it and then there is a little old us there's the general public so I want to get into the the science itself what is often presented as facts to the general public or actually themselves based on a lot of assumptions as to how to aggregate and adjust raw measurements how do we calculate measurements such as say the global mean temperature which we all hear about what do those measurements tell us about the so-called consensus and the certainty of the scientific community well it's not as easy to question this and it takes a career to figure this out if one even a Canyon I mean part of the problem is the metric of global mean temperature obviously there's no such meaningful thing there to say you can't average Mount Everest with the Dead Sea and you know get anything meaningful right you don't lift your finger into the air and say oh yes I found the global mean temperature it's 42 degrees now you obviously can't do that and they try and do something that's a little bit more sensible you know in each station they take the average over 30 years and look at the deviation from that average then average those deviations over the globe usually with the area averaging at least but you know it's never perfectly clear the most amazing thing about that number by the way is that it's very close to zero mm-hmm I mean you know one degree 1/2 degree in a century or one degree in a century that's very tiny you know every day here in New England you are talking about the cold today it's actually above freezing oh yeah looking like you went up about 15 degrees centigrade you can't perceive one degree it's as I've pointed out to people variation in such things is essential I mean for instance if you tracked your body temperature compulsively you would discover it's not constant if you look at a skyscraper it's always swaying natural systems have to vary a little bit in order to maintain stability so to treat you know as people did in speaking of the hottest year on record it's a hundredth of a degree warmer than it was another year this is insane and you're counting on the fact that people have no idea of what these quantities mean so you know something I'm sorry go ahead no so you have something that hasn't changed much but you have people arguing did it go up a hundredth degree did it go down I'm not sure this metric means anything and frequently I think the consensus view the popular consensus view is that the only way that we have stability in complex systems is total stasis perfect stasis but of course there's no reason to assume that obviously these systems have variability as you say just to maintain their own stability and that in also on the uncertainty of these oh I'm sorry go ahead if you had a rigid skyscraper what would happen to it it collapse right so the stasis you're talking about would be extremely dangerous mm-hmm that's your fluctuates because it has a restoring force and in in terms of the uncertainty of some of these measurements and in calculating some of the variation and some of the cost William Nordhaus maybe the the foremost climate change economist he has observed the massive uncertainty in calculating the cost of global warming and policies to combat global warming so depending on the model you pick and depending on my own lack of talent at reading these papers but it appears that the social cost of carbon which is the amount that you would tax carbon to efficiently capture all of its externalities is anywhere from around say 50 cents per ton of carbon dioxide to around $50 to around $48 per ton of carbon dioxide they're way off that range is way off sure it could be the wrong sign I mean carbon dioxide increases agricultural productivity right modest warming is a net benefit you know within a plausible range this might be a benefit the really crazy thing about it is we're talking about something that I think in all likelihood is beneficial as something that we're supposed to be horribly afraid of well that well that's an excellent point because as I was looking at those numbers I was just thinking of how the government would try to tax it to keep some sort of stasis or whatever but and and that's a often what is talked about is the cost of global warming right as you point out it could be a benefit to the economy and it could be a benefit to the environment it could be a benefit to humanity mm-hmm I mean after all I mean you know fossil fuels have provided the means for people to improve their life we spend their life expectancy and so on so you know even if there were drawbacks for much of the world it would be immense boon you you see this in Germany at the moment in the UK at the moment there have all these tax schemes and schemes to use renewables which increase the cost of electricity suddenly have people who are poverty-stricken because they can't afford energy right that's right and my colleague Andrew Clavin often talks about how the the environmental left they love Avatar they love the film avatar they say why can't we live like that where with lights coming out of trees and things and he says oh we can and if that's been given to us by oil and by fossil fuels we do live in that world that world is a product of our own ingenuity and using our resources wisely and given that there is always uncertainty in modeling these long-term outcomes I mean is it a benefit as it is there some cost in these complex real world systems how would you say our lawmakers should think about making so-called science-based policy well let me give you an example of run into you know lawmakers are increasingly asking for regional forecast you know how are things going to be in Colorado or in California or in Southern California or Massachusetts now they're using models and they're running them and if they look carefully they find that the models are giving them any answer they want they're all over the place the fundamental question they should ask is you know for instance in any given season there's a regional distribution of the seasonal climate do these models if you pick this correctly the answer is no can they handle the seasonal cycle in general the answer for most models in fact all of them as far as I can tell is they do that very poorly so if they don't even meet elementary tests you have to accept you don't know and then you run into the insanity of the precautionary principle says you don't have to know you just have to worry and that's enough to legislate and that's it that's something that's what are more scary than absolutely right and with organizations like the IPCC with which you have been involved and organizations that seem to be largely influenced by politics and largely are trying to influence governments to take preventative measures and damage their own economies or the global economy is there any way to get the politics out of it and to get the demagoguery out of it or are those groups and organizations formed by say the United Nations are they too hopelessly for gone to be brought back to any sort of academic freedom and rigor you know I don't know the answer to that and I'll explain why I don't know the answer to that the part of the IPCC that I was associated with or at least the first three run through subject I was working group one dealing with the science and to be sure it was biased but in general it wasn't that bad it you know had this sort of summary statement and you should think about that a little bit you know they came out with a statement there they're pretty darn sure that most of the warming over the last 50 years was due to man and you had politicians like Lieberman and McCain and so on saying see we've got the smoking gun we have to do something the world is coming to an end that statement had no such meaning in fact it was most consistent with the statement this where there's no problem the politicians have taken the view that if man has any impact at all that's a disaster that's a disaster and it has to be corrected and yes gets to an another real politicized aspect of this science which is that term consensus keeps being thrown around we talked earlier about the 90 seven percent number Lord only knows where they got that number from and which surveys went went into arriving at that number same place they got polar bears from I'm sure there's focus groups those poor polar bears I we must have really done something right because I hear their populations have increased actually over the last century lucky them you know they'll attack human beings without provocation but they look cute very cuddly you know at least the plush animals of them are very cuddly but this word consensus two days the word consensus is bandied about it reminds me of that scene in The Princess Bride where I say you keep using that word I don't think you I don't think that word means what you think it means why the focus on consensus the last time that I checked a scientific advancements are not made by democratic or popular vote why have they glommed on to that and does the so-called scientific consensus have much bearing in the in the pursuit of science itself no I mean you know it tends to influence things like funding and so on because peer review is something that is very much designed to maintain consensus that is to say you have to convince your peers that you agree with them or yeah so in that sense it's it's important but no in terms of scientific progress it's always been pretty much something that goes outside the consensus that turns out to be important now I think what this is appealing to is that people ever heard instinct and if you tell them everyone agrees with something that will convince them that's right and my my final question I suppose I'm asking for a prediction and I know that all of the climate predictions have been so far off but I say I'm a big fan of yours not because of any of your immense body of scientific work about which I know absolutely nothing and I understand very little but I'm a big fan that you are heterodox in the Academy at the University you have contravened academic and political orthodoxies of recent years do you see that situation improving on the American campus in in the near future or things gonna just keep getting worse and worse and it's always darkest before it gets even darker I like to think it's always darkest before the dawn one hopes that's the other that's the other view I suppose but yeah I I don't know I mean I what I find with students is they realize that they've been pushed into a corner I find that the activists among the students are not a majority but they certainly have the power to intimidate their peers largely through the accommodations of the administrators at universities university administrators have become my kind of disaster area mm-hmm and they keep increasing they keep hiring more and more assistant dean on this Oh it's outrageous I mean at MIT I don't think the faculty or student numbers have changed all that much since 1960 but administrators are all over and of course they need the grant overheads to support themselves you know it's it's not a good situation and I think students to some extent realize that so there's some hope maybe they'll take inspiration from you know an uprising in Iran and realize that they have mullahs that they have to overthrow as well they do and you you identified the problem I noticed that people ask all the time because all of the craziness on campuses these days I'm sorry to report comes from dear old Yale and I they say well when you were there was it as crazy and the students on this so the problem really wasn't the students and I never found it to be faculty I had wonderfully Marxist faculty who were quite accommodating and serious and dealt with me very well it's these administrators who have let the the whole place run amok and have really hollowed it out from within so I suppose we can hope that they they get what's theirs and we riot in the streets and throw at our academic mullahs that's a wonderful hopeful note to end on Richard Linz and thank you so much for being here you've cleared this up a lot for us we really appreciate it and we'll have to have you back on sometime have a good year as well okay we have got to get to this day in history but first before we do that I'm sorry folks if you're on Facebook or YouTube we appreciate having you but you got to go to the Daily wired.com right now if you already subscribe thank you you keep the lights on you keep qoph fa in my cup if not go to daily wire.com right now you will get me you'll get the end reclaim ensure you get the Ben Shapiro show blah blah blah but you will get the leftist here's tumblr now look there there is a cyclone bomb in the East Coast there are delusions of floods on the west coast there is very bitterly cold global warming all of this extreme weather is going to end in a Noahide a NOAA like flood of salty delicious leftist years do not be caught unawares you do not know the day or the hour that it will come get your leftist ears tumblr go to daily wire calm right now we'll be right back speaking of the climate variations on a theme it's time for this day in history this day in history on this day in history nearly an inch of snow fell every hour for 16 consecutive hours starving cattle and ruining ranchers in the American West know that extreme weather didn't happen last year or the year before that or the year before that nope the worst day of the worst winter in the West took place 131 years ago long before Democrat hacks ever blamed weather events on unfalsifiable apocalyptic theories plains ranchers in Montana Wyoming and the Dakotas knew nothing of the ozone layer or the greenhouse effect or political demagogues seizing upon any natural phenomenon to tighten their grip on power if they had surely they would have blamed the unseasonable hot and dry summer of 1886 on I don't know industrialization or deforestation or whatever that unseasonable dry autumn left the range almost completely barren of grass with vulnerable cattle herds wandering around hungry worse yet the snows came early that year beginning in November and blanketing the plains by January with a record snowfall the cold front even reached the Pacific Ocean dropping an all-time record 3.7 inches of snowfall in downtown San Francisco on February 5th although a warm wind briefly melted top layers of January and that actually turned out worse because the returning cold created a thick layer of ice over the entire ground making it virtually impossible for cattle to dig through to the remaining grass beneath futile attempts on the part of man to predict the weather years out compounded the problem by the mid 1880s after several consecutive warm winters the warmest winters on record they probably thought proto climatologists in the West started over stocking the ranges with cattle while they simultaneously stopped storing away winter feed for a snowy day modern climatologists can simply change their models hide the decline when their predictions don't come to fruition while political hacks explain away their failures and at the same time double down on their own hysterical claims the plains ranchers of 1886 and 1887 weren't so lucky they had to sit by and watch as their cattle slowly died historian Joseph Kinsey Howard recalled starving cattle staggered through village streets and collapsed and died in dooryards five thousand of the animals stormed the outskirts of Great Falls devouring what little the townspeople had only just planted and crying from hunger as they died the great die up as it came to be called because the American West is very whimsical killed off millions of cattle including half of Montana's entire herd their carcasses lined the countryside hundreds of ranchers fell into sudden bankruptcy some modern climate prognosticators are willing to send whole national economies into bankruptcy even as their predictions continually prove just as inaccurate as Western speculators in the 1880s but the alarmists keep up their hysterical drumbeat the science has settled they say the solutions are obvious it's just common sense we have seen the future and it works right also on this day in history in 1776 Thomas Paine published his pamphlet common sense in it he writes quote a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of custom time makes more converts than reason pain may have been more right than he knew in decadent times common sense is anything but sensible as the predictions of self-appointed elites prove wrong time and time again
