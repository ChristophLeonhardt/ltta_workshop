CHANGE THE DEBATE TO THE RISING PRICES UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. SHANNON? Shannon: EDWARD LAWRENCE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, BUT BIG-TIME DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'RE OPEN TO BACKING ELIZABETH WARREN WHO SAID THE PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC STRATEGY IS ALL WRONG. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" RUNNING HEADLINES LIKE THIS, YES, I'M A SOCIALIST, WHY CANDIDATES ARE EMBRACING THE LABEL IN 2018. SOME CALL IT THE TRUMP ECONOMIC BUMP. DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST DAVE BROWN AND SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP MARK LAUDER. LET'S GO OVER A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE HEARD THIS MORNING IN THE JOBS REPORT. 223,000 JOBS ADDED, 3.8% IS WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS, LOWEST SINCE 1969. THERE WAS ONE IN APRIL OF 2000. AFRICAN-AMERICANS, UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN TO 5.9%, THE LOWEST IN HISTORY. WHAT DO DEMOCRATS DO WITH THAT? THIS IS THE ECONOMY THAT BARACK OBAMA BUILT. WE'RE IN OUR NINTH YEAR OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXPANSION. Shannon: YOU KNOW HE'S NOT GOING TO LET ME FINISH MY POINT. THIS IS OBAMA'S LEGACY. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THESE JOB NUMBERS ARE FANTASTIC, REPUBLICAN POLL NUMBERS ARE STILL IN THE MUD. DEMOCRATS ARE LEADING ON THE GENERIC BALLOT. Shannon: BUT THAT'S REALLY TIGHTENED UP. BUT LOOK AT THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS, SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE, DEMOCRATS HAVE OUTPERFORMED ON AN AVERAGE OF NINE POINTS ACROSS THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS. IF THAT IS OUR PERFORMANCE IN THE MIDTERMS, WE RETAKE THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. IT WAS 13 POINTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, NOW THREE POINTS ACCORDING TO THE CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE. THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY NUMBER IS NOW EIGHT POINTS HIGHER WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT OFFICE, AND SIMILAR TO THE NUMBERS IN 2012. REPUBLICANS ARE SITTING WELL. AND THIS COMES DOWN TO PEOPLE HAVE MORE JOBS. THEY HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS. AND DEMOCRATS OPPOSED THE THINGS THAT HAVE JUMP STARTED THIS ECONOMY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED THIS YEAR, ON AVERAGE, WE ARE OUTPACING JOB GROWTH FROM 2016, AND 2017. THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT CALLED ROCKET FUEL, PUTTING IT IN THE ECONOMY. Shannon: "THE NEW YORK TIMES," YOU READ WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY TODAY, THEY WERE USING WORDS LIKE SPLENDID AND EXCELLENT. EMPLOYERS ARE LEADING MORE PEOPLE TO WORK, AND FEWER PEOPLE TO BE UNEMPLOYED AND LEADING WAGES TO RISE. THEY HAD A GOOD TIME AT THE SOURCE THIS MORNING. MARK MADE A POINT THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. HE SAID PEOPLE FEEL BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE MONEY IN THEIR POCKET. THE REALITY IS VOTERS AREN'T GOING TO VOTE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT A JOBS REPORT SAYS. IT'S JUST NUMBER. THEY'LL VOTE BASED ON THEIR ECONOMIC WELL-BEING, AND HOW THEY FEEL FOR THEIR FAMILY. 40% OF AMERICANS TODAY COULDN'T AFFORD AN EMERGENCY THAT COST THEM $400. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CASH. IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE MEDIAN SAVINGS PER WORKING FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY, IT'S $5,000. SO THERE'S A LOT OF INCREDIBLE ECONOMIC INSECURITY. IF YOU LOOK AT EVEN TAKE WAGE GROWTH. WE SAW A SLIGHT BUMP IN THE NUMBERS TODAY. Shannon: BUT IT'S UP 3% OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS. SURE. BUT WORKERS HAVE SEEN STAGNANT WAGES ALL THE WHILE CEO PAY ASTRONOMICAL, 300%, 400% HIGHER THAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASES NOW, MORE MONEY BEING IN THEIR POCKETS BECAUSE OF TAX CUTS, THAT DEMOCRATS OPPOSED, THE PRESIDENT'S REPUBLICANS PASSED, LOOK AT THE BONUSES HANDED OUT TO MILLIONS OF WORKERS AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MORE JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY, WHICH IS GOING TO PUT EVEN MORE PRESSURE ON WAGES TO GO UP EXCEPT COMPANIES HAVE TO FIGHT TO KEEP THE WORKERS THEY HAVE. I WOULD HAVE SAID MONEY IN THE POCKET, UNTIL THE GAS PRICES JUMPED. THE GAS PRICES HAVE ALREADY EATEN THE TAX BREAK THAT THE POOREST AMERICANS RECEIVED. WHO BY THE WAY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HIGHER GAS PRICES. 1% OF AMERICANS RECEIVED 84% OF THE BENEFIT OF THE TAX CUTS. Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT TAX POLICY CENTER, WHICH IS NONPARTISAN. IF ANYTHING, PEOPLE THINKS IT LEANS TO THE LEFT. 85% OF AMERICANS WERE GETTING A CUT UNDER THE TAX CUT, 10% WERE GOING TO REMAIN EVEN, ONLY 5% ARE GETTING A CUT. WHEN THEY SAID IT'S HELPED 1% OF AMERICAN TAXPAYERS, GETTING ABOUT 83% OF THE TAX CUT Shannon: YOU KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TAXES THEY PAY. IF DONALD TRUMP WAS SINCERE WHEN HE SAID THIS WOULD BE A TAX CUT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, WHY DIDN'T HE GIVE A MEANINGFUL TAX CUT Shannon: TO 85% OF AMERICA? THERE ARE TEACHERS WHO HAVEN'T LET'S BRING IN MARK IN. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK THE DEMOCRATS CRIED WOLF ON THE ECONOMY ONE TWO MANY TIMES. HILLARY CLINTON SAID THE ECONOMY WOULD TANK BECAUSE OF THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. THE TAX CUT PLAN, AMERICANS SEE THROUGH IT. THEY SEE THERE'S MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS. THIS ESEE MORE JOBS. THEY SEE MORE COMPANIES INVESTING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND ADDING MORE JOBS. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE RIGHT DIRECTION NUMBER GOING UP IN THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE MORE CONFIDENT. THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW THAT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO AN ELECTION IN NOVEMBER, WHETHER IT'S DO YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR TAX CUT Shannon: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CRUMBS, RIGHT?
