violent protests in Tunisia hundreds of arrests there's anger over price rises and tax hikes but the government says there's no other way to cut a ballooning deficit so how will Tunisia resolve its deep-rooted economic problems this is inside story hello welcome to the program I am Adrienne Finnegan Tunisia is widely regarded as the only Democratic success story from the Arab Spring uprisings but it's had nine governments since the overthrow of its longtime dictator in 2011 and all of them have struggled to tackle high unemployment especially among the youth towns and cities in the interior are worse off than those including the capital Tunis on the coast hopes that the 2011 revolution would bridge that gulf have been dashed demonstrations against the government's austerity measures this year began on Sunday and quickly spread the price of basic goods from food to fuel has soared but the government's sticking to its budget the main trades Union and parties in the ruling coalition say the protests threaten to destabilize the country here's a closer look at Tunisia is economy unemployment is running at more than 15 percent it's estimated that a quarter of young people are without work tourism accounts for around 8 percent of Tunisia's economy and provides thousands of jobs but the industry has struggled after two gun attacks in 2015 that killed dozens of people and the budget deficit has ballooned reaching 6 percent of gross domestic product last year the government promised to cut spending in exchange for a loan from the International Monetary Fund the measures including tax hikes aimed to bring the deficit under five percent of GDP al-jazeera's Hashim alvaro reports now from Tunis they are failures that show you right now there's this build-up which continues this is a protest that has been called for by the Tunisian opposition by the Popular Front which is a an umbrella organization of different leftist groups opposed to the government and to the austerity measures so if you can see behind me now this crowd which is chanting the people would like the government to scrap the austerity measures they want those decisions made by the government to be scrapped as soon as possible otherwise they say that they will continue to take to the streets until those put on the side this comes as a very critical moment for the Tunisians and for the government on Sunday Tunisian will commemorate the seventh anniversary of the 2011 revolution people say basically that they were hoping to see their lives improved their living standards much better than the past they say that the government has betrayed them about cutting unemployment poverty and also building a very strong economy which many people here believe is not the case now there's been a buildup of security forces around this area the building that you can see behind me is one of the main headquarters of the police so there's been this buildup of security forces and they would like to ensure that those protests don't degenerate into any acts of violence because over the last few days we've seen some of those protest movements degenerating into attacks against security forces and setting fire on a police station in the southern is the southern part of the country all right let's talk more with our guests joining us from Tunis today is osama al-safi ur a member of parliament with a conservative and actor party part of the ruling coalition from beirut were joined by nicholas no co-director of tunis exchange a research summit involving all sides of the political debate in tunisia and also in tunis Mohamed dear Hammami who's an independent research consultant who has been observing Tunisia s protests on the streets gentlemen welcome to you all Mohamed let's start with you what exactly our people protesting about and what is it that they that they want that the withdrawal of these austerity measures or change of government well nothing there is a lot of demands that's why we should separate what they are protesting and what they are demanding so they are protesting the general economic situation where they are living so during the last years the economy condition of masses Tunisians became worse but the new finance law that has been adopted by the government by the end of December triggered this new wave of protests that are mainly organized by this new movement new youth movement called fashion Estonia which means in Tunisian dialect what are we waiting for and the main demand now is the suspension of the effects of the finance law 2018 the Prime Minister says that the protesters are criminals that looting and vandalism is unacceptable and that legitimate protest should take place in daylight hours this is the after the violence that we saw at night are those protesting at the moment representative of people in Tunisia with legitimate demands every time I talk with someone and ask him about his opinion here in Canada they start talking about that talking about the loot the looting and and and and those who are involved in violence and simply because there have been during the last days a whole media campaign focusing only on that and unfortunately the official discourse is also focusing on that in the same way that in the beginning of the of the revolution Benari was accusing the the protesters to be only losers when in reality it's definitely not the the the the the strategy helps the government to avoid talking about the real issues it's true that there is violence but it's not the main problem that everyone should focusing on if if things if there is progress today it's because of the economic situation that kept going worse and worse day after day so there is violence or not it's for sure the economic situation is really bad and that's what the government should focus on instead of just attacking and framing all the protesters as riders and as violence ok Mahmoud before we bring in our other guests just give us some idea of the impact that these price and tax rises have had on ordinary people what is daily life like in Tunisia for young unemployed people or poor people who are living in the less well-developed parts of the country the interior yeah well usually the image of two years present as a divide between a coastal develop it and Inter vision that is less development where there is no infrastructure and no and where the life is difficult in reality is much more complicated than that that's why today the finish and standing movement emerged in emerged among students who are based in Tunis who are living in low-income regions of Tunis so it's not only about inter regions and and and and the coast and when so the price increase is general it has been caused by two things first the dinar depreciation that is caused by the monetary policy falls by the government and the second thing which is the new tax is brought by through news news new law so today it's very difficult for for people to rent houses and even to survive even those who have stable jobs I'm not going to talk about the 15% if doctor if you take the general unemployment rate or the more than 30% if you only focus on the unused if we tell if you focus on so those people we can't even talk about it because they don't even have any income but let's even talk about those who have a stable public job most of them are indebted and are struggling to survive and to write houses and and and to buy food - and - and to allow their kids to go to school and to provide them with with the everyday necessities and the situation is going worse enroll and worse so if and people in Tunisia compare their situation with their with the previous year they don't compare their situation to other country that are public in a war situation and that's totally legitimate so I think that you shouldn't just take a comparative approach you should see what people want and what are they expecting and what are they aiming for Nikolas know in in in Beirut how damaging is this for the Tunisian government to what extent is is Genesius government caught between a rock and a hard place it's a very difficult situation I mean let's remember were we're well known from the revolution of 2011 there have been trying times the Tunisians tunisian civil society groups have won the Nobel Peace Prize you have a representative on the show with us that has admirably strive to write a new constitution which is a model for the region in the world Tunisia has faced tremendous terrorist attacks that have nothing to do really with its own internal issues but have to do with a region that's simply on fire I mean Libya is a big failed state with multiple warlords and external influence that is very difficult for Tunisia which doesn't have basically as a very small army to defend itself so they've faced tremendous problems the key issue however is whether or not the Tunisian elite and the political leadership and the elected representatives of Tunisia together with their strong external backers are going to finally address the root problems here in Tunisia sorry there in Tunisia which is primarily centered on the socio-economic well-being of the vast majority of Tunisians who are everyday suffering under inflation corruption and monopolistic practices by a very narrow Tunisian economic elite that is very hard to solve and in my view the international community and the IMF and the World Bank and others have unfortunately chosen with some in the Tunisian leadership to take the easier way out it is much easier to raise the price of a man or woman's coffee or a product that they use every day or gas or whatever or their cell phone for example it's much harder to address the root cause of Tunisia's economic and security rot which is primarily centered around a triangle made up of the security services the traditional mafias and also the economic elites of the country unless that is addressed and unless the 50 percent of the Tunisian economy which is in the black market is addressed Tunisia will not be able to protect itself in the medium and long term and it certainly will not be able to improve its economy it's very easy to raise taxes on the vast majority of middle-class and working-class Tunisians it's much harder to go after the big cats the big the big dinosaurs in the security services that are continuing to profit to the tune of millions tens of millions hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars that is ruining the Tunisian economy and that is frankly stopping the future for a lot of young Tunisians who may want to start their own small businesses or whatever it may bring them that's the key issue all right do they have it in them to address that Nicholas just want to clear something up is Tunisia being held hostage by foreigner despite by the IMF I gotta tell you I think we've all seen this movie before I mean we've all seen a developing or semi developed country coming out of dictatorships struggling with democracy and time and time again these international financial institutions backed by some elites and some interests in Western countries push these kinds of subsidy reforms raising taxes all of the things that are designed to really rattle the vast majority of the population that is already struggling with the transitional framework so in this case I think the IMF the World Bank and European and American backers of this effort have to take some responsibility that time is not the time is not right to increase the burdens of the average Tunisian the time is right to address fundamental structural reform but by the way just a few weeks ago Tunisia was listed as one of the tax havens for Europeans right so there are also European interests that don't want to see real structural changes happen in Tunisia the time has come for everyone to really address this we need to stop pumping money in my view into the black box of the security services to try and defeat terrorism and we need to actually push forward fundamental reforms in the security services together with the economic elites that are really ruining the country in the medium long term and now we're seeing even in the short okay well let's let's put all of that to a member of parliament part of the ruling coalition in Tunis Osama also here what do you make of what you just heard of people like you part of the ruling elite ruining Tunisia have you taken the easy way out actually I think as we succeed in the democratic process and know we have a democratic constitution we're facing the second big challenge which is the economic one and the social one and we need time for the Democratic one we needed an agreement between the political politician from all political parties which include the opposition for the economic one it is more complicated first of all I want to clarify that it is not right to compare the score of this course of the government today with with what Ben Ali used to say during the demonstration in 2011 I don't think this is right actually today in Tunisia protesting peacefully is totally protected by the Constitution and and and yesterday we had an important demonstration in front of the palace of the government done by the professor University professor and and in front of the Parliament every day were having demonstration so the point is that these days we are having a different kind of prototype protesting which is the violent one so we are supporting totally the peaceful one which is protected by the Constitution and which is one of the main important gain that we have after the with the democracy and after the fall of Ben Ali but we are against the night demonstration that are attacking private and public properties that even the agitator which is the Union the most important union in Tunisia is against this this night protest and asking for people to be to go on the streets if they want to but during the day so the point is this we're doing actually very important reforms okay and it is not it's not easy to do reforms in our region and but are you saying there in the right way are you going the right way about fixing the economy I mean would it not have been better to invest perhaps in infrastructure and jobs rather than implement austerity that hurts the economic well-being of those who are least able to afford it actually this is exactly what we are doing and employment was 18 percent today is 15.3 that means that we're going in the right direction the point or the challenge is that there is a high social expectation which is higher than what we are able today to give to to the people particularly the poorest people and and and we are focusing more only on the best part of the reforms that were doing and we're not giving the full picture that were taxing the big companies and we're supporting the small and medium companies that were supporting agriculture companies we're giving money to the poor families it is not only Rises of the price but the point is why all this is happening it is happening because we decided three weeks ago to have the election in May and one of the points that the reasons one of the reasons that is rising this kind of focus on on the bad part of the reforms it is because we are in a political situation and we're going to to have the election or even the Popular Front it is very important to say this the opposition voted for the article 39 which includes the races of the price so why the opposition voted for the races of the price and then asked the ask to the people to go to the streets alright I know my habit dirham a me wants to wants to come in on that it is the government going in in the right direction why did the opposition well essentially austerity measures if they're now protesting about it that's actually what I was saying the problem is that the ruling giladhiz is not answering to the real question instead of answering is there sir austerity or not the austerity work or not they are accusing each other and that's not gonna make the situation better it's true that the communication is a bit a little bit more professional than than the Banali issue so now there is a whole media campaign instead of just a concerted declaration but the approach is still the same escaping and and denying what's happened what's happened what's happening in reality so so even when we talk about taxation of big companies that's not an iconic policy agrees in taxation whatever it's on consumption or on or on companies for the only purpose of reducing the budget deficit is definitely not an economic policy and and unfortunately that's the tragedy that's the traditional Indonesian in the Tunisian government for it that goes back even to the binary area and that has been adopted by the current government and even when we talk about the IMF and the World Bank so yes we can say that the IMF is taken in certain hostage the Tunisian government by imposing its conditionality especially with monetary policies that led to the this liberalization of the dinar and also be independent of the central bank that prevents the the people who have political will to change the economic policies where they got well the IMF is exposing for its technical assistance programs but at the same time we have it we have a government that is also that is also pushing for the same reform and legitimizing them instead of trying to find what didn't work during the last years are the only thing that the government has been doing is adopting laws like the investment code the public part in private adopting laws public-private partnership yes those laws that's the what the World Bank I have been asked that we can even find them in the electro program of banana 2009 if you go back and that's not how we're gonna improve the situation of of the country the following inaudible policy in the same way that the government of banana has been doing since and since since the 80s is not gonna solve this solution actually it's gonna make it worse so I think it's time to reconsider the approach of just letting go the letting grow the economy in any in that in there like a purely a dogmatic way thinking that private investors will go to people to regions where there is absolutely nothing in order to create jobs and even when we talk about 15 percent large part of it are precarious jobs and low income jobs talking only about the rate is and decrease afraid of 3 points it doesn't reflect the the reality of the situation all right think that's why I'm saying they are living in denial Nikolas know to what extent were to newzeas problems simply too big to fix quickly in 2011 in that whoever came to power after the the revolution would have inked counted the same economic problems and would would not have been able to fix them as quickly as ordinary people expect them to be fixed no I think that there were despite the huge problems there were pathways to avoid where we seem to be at right now which is an further destabilization of Tunisia I think that you have incredible Tunisian Democrats incredible young Tunisians like Mohamed via and lots of others who have really tried their best to put Tunisia on the right track against very adverse circumstances I really put the blame on the big international players not only the international financial institutions but also my country the US and Europe specifically because they have not offered Tunisia the kind of support and they have not offered Tunisian Democrats the kind of hard sticks to be able to fundamentally reform the deep state of Tunisia out of existence this is a hard task but it can be done and it especially can be done in a relatively peaceful democratic country relatively homogeneous like Tunisia let me just review the history for a quick second which is in 2015 when you had the dual and then third terrorist attacks that really devastated Tunisia all of the external big players including my country and the European countries suddenly focused only on one thing counterterrorism counterterrorism counterterrorism and they poured tens of millions of dollars into this black box called the security sector they bought some short term security stabilization for Tunisia but you know what almost 1% of the Tunisian population is now in jail you have young men and women who have not seen a lawyer for two three four years and have not been in front of a judge even you are creating a violent jihadist 2.0 that is a medium and long term security threat for the country meanwhile you have merely funded the exact kind of triangle that we spoke about before that is rotting the economy from within this intersection between economic monopolists traditional mafias and also the security sector and remember half of the Tunisia economy is the black market it's an incredible number and all three of those poles are benefiting from that unfortunately the US and the European Union have not had the courage or I think the focus to really go after that as the key problem that is the problem not even the violent extremists right now which at least thankfully have been kept at bay by some security stabilization but in the medium and long term and now in the short term we see who needs it needs a different approach we're almost out of out of time Osama say hey we'll give the final word to you tunisia needs a final a different approach if you're riding roughshod over human rights by the side of what Nicholas's is saying why are you ignoring or denying what what's really happening in Tunisia absolutely not again the answer to the question why the opposition voted for the rises and then asked to the people to go to the streets no one answered to this question the point is that we're not growing ignoring anything we know that we have real difficulties in our country numbers are pretty growing in a good direction so GDP is growing the black market and the corruption that we're have we have in Tunisia is one of the priorities of the government so I think we are in the right direction we need a real support from our partners because it's true that sometimes we don't feel the support our democracy is still too young we need a real support to have a successful democracy in Tunisia if we have this we're going to have more possibility more jobs for youth and more more more investment for the internal regions that are at the situation the situation in those internal regions marginalized the regions is getting better but it is not enough as we as we should as we sure as we should we're out of time many thanks indeed to all of you summer I'll say here
