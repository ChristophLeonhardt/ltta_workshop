FOREMAN TEAM AND TENDENCIES RESEMBLING A DISPOSITION. Martha: JOINING ME NOW, NIGEL FARAGE, AND A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REMARKS ABOUT IRAN AND HIS RESPONSE? FIRST, HIS RESPONSE IS A BIT RICH FOR THE WORLD'S FIRST ISLAMIC EXTREMIST REGIMES AND WHICH HAS NOW BEEN IN PLACE FOR 40 YEARS TO ACCUSE OTHERS OF RACISM, EXTREMISM AND NAZISM WHICH FRANKLY IN MANY WAYS IS ALL THAT MAY BE ENCOMPASSED OVER THESE DECADES. THIS IS I THINK WITHOUT DOUBT THE MOST DANGEROUS AND UNPLEASANT REGIME IN THE WORLD. TRUMP, AND CLEARLY JOHN BOLTON BEING THERE NOW IS A VERY IMPORTANT INFLUENCE. TRUMP IS CALLING OUT IRAN, AND HE SAYS YOU GUYS ARE SPONSORING TERRORISM, SPREADING IT ACROSS YOUR BORDERS. THE DEAL THAT OBAMA STRUCK WITH YOU DID NOT WORK. FAR FROM TAMING YOU, IT MAY DO WORSE. AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S VERY INTERESTING BUT OF ALL THAT WAS SAID TODAY, I THINK YOU END BY TRUMP, IRAN HAD THE MOST INTERESTING THING. BECAUSE TODAY OF ALL DAYS, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S FOREIGN MINISTER WHO BY THE WAY IS UNELECTED, SHE SAID TODAY THE E.U. IS FACILITATING EASIER TRADE WITH IRAN. SO YOU HAVE TRUMP ON COLLISION COURSE, FOR THE GOOD GUYS AND THE BAD GUYS. CLEARLY THIS IS ALL OVER THE IRAN DEAL AND TRUMP'S DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL. AND, THE E.U. PUSHED BACK TO THAT. PRESIDENT TRUMP CLEARLY CALLED FOR THE ALLIES TO RALLY TOGETHER. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WILL CHANGE THAT IN TERMS OF THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE U.K. OR THE REST OF EUROPE? AS FAR AS THE E.U. IS CONSIDERED, NO. WE SHOULD EMBRACE THEM ECONOMICALLY. THE TRUMP BOLTON IDEA IS, THESE GUYS GIVE IT A CHANCE WITH THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. THEY ABUSED THIS AND BECOME EVEN MORE TERRORISTIC AND SPREAD THAT BAD MESSAGE ALL OVER THAT REGION. SO KNOWN. THOSE TWO POSITIONS ARE UNCOMPROMISING FROM A BRITISH POINT OF VIEW, AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING. BREXIT, WHICH WOULD MAKE US INDEPENDENT ULTIMATELY, THE U.K. WILL HAVE TO DECIDE. ARE WE WITH AMERICA OR WITH THE E.U.? Martha: THAT WILL BE A BIG MOMENT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP TO BE SURE. HE SAT DOWN AT THE U.N. WITH THE PRESIDENT OF KOREA, AND HE SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE PROGRAM IN NORTH KOREA. CHAIRMAN KIM ACTUALLY WANTS TO ACHIEVE THE COMPLETE DISPOSITION OF NORTH KOREA. IN ORDER TO MAKE PROGRESS, HE WANTS TO HAVE THE SECOND NORTH KOREA SUMMIT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. VERY STRONG CLAIM. KIM WANTS TO HAVE A DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA WITHIN THE FIRST TERM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? WHETHER I BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WORLD LEADERS WHO ARE SET ENEMIES SITTING DOWN TALKING TOGETHER IS A GOOD THING. WINSTON CHURCHILL USED TO SAY, DRAW DRAW IS BETTER THAN WAR WAR. AND I WOULD WELCOME A SECOND MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREANS. NOTHING BAD COULD COME OF IT. OBVIOUSLY THE WORLD BODY AND THE U.N. IS A CONTROVERSIAL PLACE. THE PRESIDENT SAID SOMETHING TODAY THAT GOT THE A CHUCKLE FROM THE CROWD. I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTIONS. IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN ALMOST ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY. I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT REACTION, BUT THAT'S OKAY. Martha: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT MOMENT, NIGEL? DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER, EVER UNDERSELL HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. HE DID IT IN FRONT OF A VERY, VERY SKEPTICAL U.N. AUDIENCE AND THEY LAUGHED, WHETHER IT WAS WITH HIM OR AGAINST HIM, IT DIDN'T MATTER. IT WAS THE LATEST MOMENT OF THAT SPEECH BECAUSE HE WENT ON FROM THERE TO ATTACK MUCH OF WHAT THAT STANDS FOR. AND I SPENT 25 YEARS FIGHTING NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AGAINST GLOBAL BUREAUCRACY AND TO ME THAT SPEECH TODAY WAS AN ABSOLUTE WAY. AND ALL OF IT YOU HEARD TODAY IN
