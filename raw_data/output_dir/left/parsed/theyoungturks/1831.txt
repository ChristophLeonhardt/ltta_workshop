IS THIS THE WORST PROMPOSAL
EVER?
IT IS PROM SEASON AT HIGH
SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
PEOPLE ARE GETTING US TO PROMPT
AND THIS HAPPENED AT A
HIGH SCHOOL, AN 18
YEAR OLD WHO IS SUBSTANTIALLY IN
LOVE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND OR GIRL
HE WANTED US TO PROMPT AND SO HE
WENT AND MADE A SIGN FOR HER.
WHAT DID THAT SIGN LOOK LIKE?
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
IT SAYS IF I WAS BY, I'D BE
PICKING COTTON, BUT I'M WHITE,
SO I'M PICKING YOU FOR PROM.
WHAT A STUPID SIGN.
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS THE LEAST
CREATIVE, SMART WAIT TO DO A
PROPOSAL. HE RAN OUT OF SPACE
WITH THE STENCILS AND HAD TO
WRITE PROM IN SMALL LETTERS.
HE USED THE WRONG GRAMMAR.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE CUTE.
LIKE A JOKE.
I KNOW, I AM GOOD EVOKE OUR
NATIONAL SHAME AND DO IT POORLY.
THAT WILL GET HER.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
CHRONOLOGICALLY.
YOU WOULD NOT BE CURRENTLY
PICKING COTTON.
YOU HAVE SO MUCH TIME MAKING A
SIGN LIKE THAT TO DECIDE TO
YOURSELF, THAT IS A BAD IDEA.
BUT SHE PUT UP THE HEART
EMOJI SO I THINK IT WORKED OUT
REALLY?
THIS IS FROM A SNAP. ON
THE GIRL'S SNAP PROFILE AND AT
THE VERY BOTTOM, IT IS
TWO HEART EMOJIS.
SHE LOVED IT.
SHE SAID YES.
OH THAT'S TRUE, IF YOU ARE
BLACK, YOU WOULD BE PICKING
COTTON.
THAT IS SUCH A GOOD POINT, I
WOULD LOVE TO GO TO PROM WITH
YOU.
MY PROBLEM IS THE NON SEQUITUR.
HE IS A KID, I WILL CUT A LITTLE
SLACK ON THE RUNNING
OUT OF SPACE.
RUNNING OUT OF A SPACE ON THE
SIGN, I HAVE BEEN THERE.
I WOULD ARGUE IT IS TOO
CREATIVE.
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO GO THERE.
HE DID THE DUMBEST THING
HE COULD.
ON SO MANY LEVELS.
ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS ARE BLUE,
SUGAR IS SWEET, AND SO ARE YOU.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, IT
DOESN'T RELATE SO MAYBE THAT
IS HIM LIKE, WHAT IS IT RELATED
TO YOU GOING TO PROM BUT
PROVIDES A NICE RHYME?
IT DOESN'T EVEN RHYME.
IT IS JUST SO WEIRD.
IT IS ALMOST NOT RACIST AT A
CERTAIN POINT.
THAT IS A REALLY INTERESTING
QUESTION.
BUT, IT IS A SMALL STORY, BUT IT
GOES TO SHOW THE MINDSET IN
SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE
THEY READ THE SIGN.
LIKE BRETT SAID, HE PROBABLY
TOOK 30 MINUTES TO WRITE IT,
THIS IS
STILL A GOOD IDEA.
STILL A GOOD IDEA.
APPARENTLY IT WAS BECAUSE
SHE SAID YES.
THIS IS NOT A FEDERAL CRIME.
HE IS A KID.
IS IT EVEN RACIST?
IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS RACIST.
IF A 38-YEAR-OLD MAN HELD A SIGN
AND WAS RUNNING FOR POLITICAL
OFFICE, THAT IS A DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION BUT IN THIS CASE,
IT IS ALMOST SO DUMB THAT IT
FEELS A LITTLE INNOCENT.
WHAT YOU THINK?
I DO NOT THINK IT IS INNOCENT, I
THINK IT IS JUST DUMB.
I AM GOING TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT
COTTON PICKING, A TOPIC THAT I
AM ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT AND
EVERYONE IS ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT.
THIS IS SO GREAT, SHE IS GOING
TO LOVE THIS PROM PROPOSAL.
MY INSTINCT IS, CAN WE GO TO THE
PHOTO AGAIN OF THE KID HIMSELF.
SEE HIS SHOES, HOW HE IS WEARING
THOSE TOP SIDERS WITH NO SOCKS
ON?
THAT MEANS HE IS EXTRA WHITE.
HE IS SUPER WHITE.
THAT IS EXTRA WHITE WITH A
HIGH OF A SHORT.
THERE'S PROBABLY A PLEAT
INVOLVED.
HIS APOLOGY WAS STUPID TOO.
LIKE I AM SORRY IF I
OFFENDED YOU, WHICH IS NOT
AN APOLOGY.
NEVER ACCEPTED THAT APOLOGY,
IF I OFFENDED YOU.
IT IS JUST NOT A FEDERAL
CASE, I AM KEEPING IT REAL
BECAUSE I HAVE DONE A LOT OF HIS
DRUGS, NOT THE CRAZY SIGN, BUT
I WORE THOSE SHOES IN
HIGH SCHOOL.
I DID, AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
I AM NOT EXTRA WHITE.
REALLY?
THEY JUST LOOK SO WHITE TO ME.
MAYBE IT IS AN EAST COAST
THING AND THE BOTTOM LINE IN
ALL OF THIS IS WE TALK ABOUT IT
SO THAT THE NEXT TIME SOME KID
IS THINKING OF DOING A SIGN
THEY GO YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE THAT IS A STUPID IDEA.
MAYBE PEOPLE, SOME PEOPLE
WILL TAKE IT AS REALLY OFFENSIVE
AND MAY BE VERY LOGICALLY SO AND
OTHERS WILL NOT BE SO OFFENDED
BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
LEGITIMATELY OFFENDED, I DO NOT
WANT TO OFFEND THEM, UNLESS YOU
DO IN WHICH CASE, THAT IS A
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.
HE IS PROBABLY NOT THE MOST
RACIALLY SENSITIVE HUMAN BEING
AND WE CAN EDUCATE THEM, THERE
IS A ROBO CALL THAT WENT OUT
FROM THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION
SAYING:
TREVOR HARVEY OF THE LOCAL
NAACP CHARTER SAID:
THEY SAID THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD
IMPLIED THEY WERE GOING TO DO
JOINT TRAINING SIMILAR TO WHAT
HAPPENED AT STARBUCKS WHEN THEY
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A
SENSITIVITY TRAINING, WHAT IS
IT, SUBCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING
IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL
CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO KIND OF
GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS THAT THIS
IS NOT OKAY BUT LAST QUESTION.
DOES HE GO TO PROM OR IS HE
NOT ALLOWED TO?
HE HAS TO GO TO PROM AND HIS
CLASSMATES HAVE TO LOOK AT HIM
AND MAKE HIM KNOW THAT HE
IS STUPID.
HE HAS TO SANDWICH
BOARD THE SIGN.
DO NOT DO THAT.
DON'T BRING THE SIGN ANYWHERE,
LET'S BE DONE WITH THAT A
I THINK HE NEEDS TO
FEEL THE SHAME.
MY FINAL THOUGHT OF ON IT IS
THE RIGHT WING WILL
SAY, I DON'T WANT TO BE
SENSITIVE.
BUT THEY ARE KIDS, WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO TEACH AND THE
RIGHT THING SO I THINK IT MAKES
PERFECT SENSE FOR THE SCHOOL
TO SAY, LOOK, THIS REALLY HURTS
A LOT OF PEOPLE AND YOU WANT
TO HURT PEOPLE?
IF YOU DO, THAT IS A DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION, BUT IF YOU
DON'T, UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS
HURTFUL AND THE HISTORY BEHIND
THAT AND WHY PEOPLE ARE REALLY
LEGITIMATELY OFFENDED BY THAT
SO THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE WHEN YOU ARE AN ADULT
AND ALAN THE WORLD BECAUSE IT
CAN COST YOU A JOB, BESIDES
WHICH, CAN MAKE PEOPLE ANGRY AND
AGAIN, I HOPE YOU DO NOT
ACTUALLY WANT TO DO THAT.
