minutes over here in Oregon that's right
and as it means the as Moon moves across

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,630
you'll see subtle changes in the
structure of the corona that's sort of

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,369
with the light passing through different
parts of the valleys of the moon in the

6
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,870
profile but it's really though is the
rehab see the rentable chromis oh my God

dropped between maybe 5 and 10 degrees

left-hand side is there zooming in we
