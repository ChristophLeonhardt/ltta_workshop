Hi.
My name’s David Leitch.
I’m the director
of “Deadpool 2."
So here we have a scene where
Deadpool has joined the X-Men.
It’s sort of a pivotal
point in the film,
a lot of story arcs
coming together,
and he’s with his new crew.
And you can see him
in his trainee jersey.
That was sort of
a choice we made.
Instead of giving
him an X-Men suit.
Actually, he’s got
some learning to do
on the processes of
what the X-Men do
and what he thinks the X-Men do.
"— like Beyonce says, 'please,
please stop cheating on me.'"
"Hey!"
You might think some
of this is improv,
but it really comes from a
well-crafted script, written
by Rhett Reese, Paul
Wernick and Ryan Reynolds.
And you really just sort
of have to be precise
and true to that bible
as you’re doing this.
"I’ll ask the questions.
Let me talk to the kid.
You stay here with your
weird secret sex lips."
Julian Dennison becomes sort
of the key part of the plot.
And it’s going to be his
relationship with Deadpool that
sort of drives the engine
of the movie moving forward.
"Hi, there."
"Stay back or Justin Bieber dies."
"Ha!
Justin Bieber.
He called you Justin Bieber."
We do set up some conflict
between their styles
and how Deadpool approaches
fighting justice,
and the X-Men fight justice.
"Firefist?
Ooh, that’s a great name.
Where does it burn?
Just the fist, or all
the way up to the elbow?"
I work closely with my
cinematographer, Jonathan Sela,
to block these scenes, because
there’s so much stuff going on.
I mean, you have
visual effects, you
have comedic tone
you’re dealing with,
you have a dramatic tone
you’re dealing with.
I think blocking is
a key part of this.
It’s a pretty good example of
Deadpool process in a nutshell.
"Oh."
