boxes why would I why would I need them
um so if you want free boxes for
whatever reason you need big boxes um
Walmart gets their shipments at ten
o'clock at night so if you go to Walmart
at eleven oh if you're gonna wanna
around 11:00 11:30 they should have
stopped people should be stocking the
aisles and they have their boxes just
lying around and you just walk up to the
masks can I take these boxes off your
hands usually they're more than happy
because it's less work for them because
you're the one carrying the boxes now if
you want boxes from Target if there is
in a Walmart by your house target gets
their shipments in the morning so if you
go there around 8 o'clock in the morning
that's when you'll find the boxes
everywhere and then stocking the shelves
that's just a tip in case you know you
want boxes for whatever reason people
want boxes
