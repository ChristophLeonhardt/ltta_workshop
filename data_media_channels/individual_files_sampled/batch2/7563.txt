so Rudy Giuliani said a ton of stuff that got Donald Trump trouble right so and and there's a couple parts that I think are not focused on enough first of course he admits that Trump did pay stormy Daniels we're all familiar with that to me actually the more damning thing is get not getting nearly enough attention which is that he said yeah he fired James cover because the Russia investigation you just admit an obstruction of justice that's clear clear clear super clear I don't know why we're not all focused on that okay for yesterday okay yes so of course we talked about it but I don't know why the rest the media is not covering it as much maybe because that part doesn't involve a porn stuff totally like right yeah so okay but to the third part it was super fascinating where he says they better not go after Ivanka Trump and he again double down today things said he'd go in with a Lance or something if they came after Ivanka and how could they touch this beautiful child and like okay that's Trump talking that's clearly he had him say that but that's not the interesting part you would expect that the interesting part is he said well Jared he's a male so he's dispensable what what did you just say so Jared Kushner Ivanka's husband is dispensable yeah so mad when he heard that men are disposable but is that so is Trump planning to throw his own son-in-law under the bus I think he is I mean Julie I need you to come up with that on his own Oh clearly Trump Adam say all these things to Brett's point from earlier in the show there's only so many people who could fall on a sword for you before you realize you got nobody left around you yeah and and if now he's making Giuliani fall on a sword for lying about stormy Daniels if he goes and takes out Jared Kushner that's your Christopher moment Christopher you're gonna be okay bye-bye black screen yeah and we never find out what happened I didn't actually watch them so I stopped three but what my read of the vodka Jared stuff was I think that he has talked with Trump enough to know that Trump is absolutely in love with his daughter in every sense of the word and doesn't really like Jared as much anymore so I don't know that it necessarily means he's about to toss Jared aside but I think that making an offhand comment that's incredibly supportive of Ivanka while saying that Jared not so much he knows he's being watched by Trump's a Trump is gonna love that you're always playing to that audience of one but I think that in a larger sense it's another way to try to get the Trump supporters to be 100% against this investigation and to not even question if something comes out don't even think about it you want them to hate this investigation all of the Trump supporters like Ivanka Trump I've seen no indication that they're going after Ivanka despite the fact that she apparently has broken the law multiple times which we've covered they're not going after so why bring up that they're going after her to scare Trump supporters that love of Anka Trump and want are protected and I think there is also this whole thing with Reid Giuliani the the questions that got leaked from the Muller probe and this is one of the questions in the Muller probe all this stuff about Michael Cohen mate they they address these exact issues hitting it these exact campaign finance violations it seems to me like they want it like this you know meeting of the minds between Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani is like all right they already have tape on us saying that you know I don't know anything about it they raided Cohen's financial files they're gonna see a receipt for $130,000 plus what a little bit extra what is that extra you actually hear Rudy Giuliani say plus a little bit to wet his beak plus a little bit of interest enough to pay the taxes they're gonna see the receipts like the manna for receipts in the Ukraine where it's like you know pay off to this person for a whole lot of money they want to have tape in the media around that that kind of hints that they're explaining it ahead of time it seemed like they were floating the idea Rudy had no idea I mean neither did Trump 12 hours after it went down that they'd have to you know push Rudy in front of the bus and run the other way but that's how it's played out and I think if we take those 49 questions and look at the next two weeks of Trump behavior we'll see a lot of things trying to address those very issues ahead of the subpoena to see how they play so it's interesting so one further thing about Ivanka that's I think very important answers John's question and I had an epiphany in the middle of bread talking okay so usually they're guys who run fusion GPS they're the ones who originally commissioned the steeled dossier with the tape in it and all the other things that well now 80% have been proven true they wrote an op-ed a couple of days ago talking about the money laundering that that's what the real deal is that Trump has been money laundering for a long time they say possibly right I say definitely I've been saying that for a long time and then but what's interesting about that is Ivanka was in on a lot of those deals and so they explain that in their op-ed in The New York Times so my epiphany is oh that's how they're gonna get Trump to resign because the only other person he cares about on the planet is a vodka so if they say now Donald we have the manna fort receipts we have the Michael Cohen receipts we have her dead to rights your call either you all go to jail or you resign that's why one morning you're gonna wake up and you're gonna hear that Donald Trump has already left the building and you're gonna be like what no that I could what wait what and that's what's gonna happen he's gonna resign just like that in an instant two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on
