hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle on this edition of the program we discuss Russia's relationship with the West Ukraine and a lot of history crosstalking cutting the Gordian knot i'm joined by my guest here moscow jeffrey roberts he's an historian senior fellow at the helsinki gloom for advanced studies and a member of the royal irish academy and we have Nicolai Petro he's a professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island all right gentlemen let's talk about cutting the Gordian knot where we all know the poor state of relations between the west and Russia we both know that very well how do we get out of this cul-de-sac or we just have to accept the status quo for a very long time to come I'm afraid it's the latter I don't see any political figure on the horizon in the West who could take the lead and show that kind of innovative thinking that would lead to an era of mutual benefit and potential reconciliation between the East and West because I do think in the long run it will happen because there's a lot of general frustration among many knowledgeable politicians and academics and observers but there's no one willing to step up to the plate as it were and assume that responsibility basically of saying you know the the emperor has no clothes we need different we need it a Nixon to go to China something something like that yes and and to see it through the hope had been that Trump would be able to do this but he seems to be bamboozled by his own advisers and unable to extricate himself from the general morass that is Washington today what does this alter Marxist slogan which I still rather like which is pessimism of the intellect optimism of the will so yeah I think we're right to be pessimistic about the the ComicCon juncture in Russia's relations where the West is very difficult to see in the mediate way forward probably ever and I think we need to be optimistic in terms of future prospects yeah we've been here before there's been very bad period in Russian America and thought out Russian Soviet relations before you know gaps will change that the situation will change one general general partner make is ok there was lots of specific issues at dispute between Russia and the West at the moment but there's a something more general going on isn't there which is the Wesley trying to to isolate a marginalize Russia and not succeeding by the way as an international player and that's what's happened in the past we're going to be talking about some some some history in just a moment I hope one lessons about history is that if you want to solve world problems problems of peace security stability you have to involve Russia and I think that fundamental lesson will actually you know come to the fore from this side of the pond people that I talk to here there is what's the point in trying to talk they don't want to talk isolation the Soviet Union was a sanctioned an isolated to this it's not something that's new here I mean II I think that the the willingness to reach out the hand the Russian hand go out to the west is quite limited right now it's what's the point once the next round of sanctions based on what you've never produced to us or the public I think there's there's a lot less of a a sense of initiative on the Russian side now after all of this true and there is this sense that there is the note the idea that the ball is in the other person's Court and and we're waiting it to for it to be logged back but one of the things that I think distinguishes this period of hostility from previous periods is the lack of basic respect for the other side and there is a sense in Washington among people who seem to have lost touch with reality and and lost any awareness of history specifically that respect somehow is due only to people who have power who can hurt you but respect actually has to go deeper it has to be a more general respect and awareness for the cultural and culture and tradition of other other people not only for what they have they can potentially harm you and until we regain some broader sense of how Russia fits into the West is part of the Western community I'm afraid we won't be able to talk to each other yes if you mentioned history here we have the anniversary of the Munich Agreement the preamble to the start of the Second World War in Europe what can we learn from that because there's one word people always remember from that they don't always remembered the year they don't always remember the characters I've watched it on cable TV they screw it up all the time appeasement right we're in a moment now kind of echoing what Nicolai had to say is that if you even venture forward to try to get involved in some kind of dialogue to cut this Gordian knot you are committing fees Medfield that is a really bad place to be well JP Taylor was always fun - saying the only lesson of history is that people don't learn from history now I think he was wrong I think the lesson from history is that people do learn from history but they learn the wrong lesson and the wrong lesson that's just learned from the Munich crisis is there appeasement a piece because wrong that concessions are wrong completely the wrong less and less there's nothing wrong with appeasement in the current international conjuncture that's what we need we need a peace Minh Thuy need concessions we need negotiation we need accommodation the historical lesson that the Munich crisis was that you couldn't peace hit there in the Nazis but that doesn't mean to say you can't appease other dictators or the order appeasement camp can't can't actually be a normal foreign policy which it was before before the meeting unit and immediate crisis so let's learn from history let's learn the right lessons in the history well getting back back to what I said about respect respect presumes that you are trying to listen to what the other side has to say and that's where dialogue comes in dialog again presumes that two voices are speaking not just not just one voice in an echo chamber taking a public stand too much is taking place in the public eye and not enough where it used to be in traditional diplomacy in the in the quietness of rooms where people can actually negotiate agreements with each other and then bring them forth when everything is done in the spotlight we we see from everything in the news that the it brings out the worst in people yeah yeah I think this far far too much public disappointment diplomacy and international relations this is called public diplomacy I mean it's almost intentional they're intentionally sabotaging it I mean it there is no there's no genuine interest in doing it because unfortunately going back to this term or misunderstood and wrongly remembered term appeasement is that you're when you if you get involved in a dialogue you're involved with a dialogue with someone that is no moral stature and that's the problem we have right now I mean Nixon went to China I mean two very different systems China had just gone to the was going through the great Cultural Revolution but Nixon had the guts and foresight to do public diplomacy is it it's it's a prisoner of domestic politics more often not that's that's the problem I grieved Nikolai that the question of respect is is fundamental here I also think it's a question of trust it's the rest or it's the change in the atmosphere restoration truss restoration of nuclear respect now on that basis you might get some political movement forward right to your earlier point about well you know how much longer should Russia continued handout and the friendship hold out have the friendship and cooperation when you know we can see what happens I've been really impressed by you know the persistence of its two Russian Russian Federation but Putin Lavrov continued to actually try and engage in a dialogue we would continue to fight they've actually found points I mean in the in the in the waning days of the Obama administration two different cease fires were set up for Syria and when we know what party broke those cease fires because they didn't want to see Russia on the same equal diplomatic playing field and that was intentional and we heard of Iran agreement and we had the ironic man we much of what has happened with North Korea is also thanks to the persistent efforts of Russia to foster a peaceful resolution on that on that Peninsula so Russia has a sensible policy and I do believe that the rest of the world comparing Russia's policy with that of the United States and and some of its European partners sees that so that even if you have to take public stances in favor of policies that are not sensible in the long run your own national interest dictates a more sensible approach and that brings you willy-nilly closer to Russia you know it's it's as unfortunately we have now it's just a zero-sum game one side wins one side loses there's an it's black and white but that I mean you can go through the great power rivalries of the of the 17th 18th 19th century and then even in the early 20th century we've never had just a complete zero-sum you know at some point you know going back to national interests you you should be able to find your national interests and be able to coexist with your adversary while achieving your national interests that there there's no reason why it should be a zero sum game I mean that's that's a that's a political choice and that situation could be changed but by political choices and that's the that's the path we need to go it needs to go along a foreign policy that is based on reset on respect mutual respect creates a positive dynamic creates what social scientists call a virtuous circle so you can by fostering hostility lead to the withdrawal of a good relay of the damaging of relations and of trust or you can reverse that cycle and lead to a positive this zero-sum game concept is really in the middle we're either on one side of it or another and moving in that direction so I think just as we have been moving in a direction which heightens tension and creates crises by reversing this the policy that we're now doing with that will lead us in the opposite direction hold that thought here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue more discussion on Russia's relations with the West stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peterloo altrimenti were discussing Russia's relations with the West okay let me go back there and Jeffrey one of the things where Russia in the United States popped up over the last few days was president Trump's addressed to the General Assembly of the United Nations he talked about a lot of things we could make an entire week of programs on every topic that he mentioned but what caught your eye when it came to Russia what what what the thought that Trump speech prompted me is that we should actually stop watching Trump speeches we should stop watching him we reshot you because watching Trump's be guessing the way of us understanding what he's trying to say so I think we should actually concentrate on the on his text row of anomalies performance so if you read the text of his speech to the UN what struck me were about it was that how ideologically driven Trump is as a political leader and then the thing is if you look if you actually deconstruct the ideological perspective he's putting forward in that space you know he talks about sovereignty nation-states patriotism critical realism he's kind of like vision of global politics isn't actually that much different from the vision of Russia division of China division the division of other countries but of course at the same time he's doing he's saying yeah let's return this or return to nativism and and coexist happily together he's also trying to boss the United States she's trying to boss the whole world like it used to trying to interfere here threatened here deploy its power now what that tells me is this is that Trump is very much you know a transitional figure in this process of a movement away from American globalism ideologically and politically so in a way that kind of gives me hope for the future is that this is just a phase we're going through and a direction of this phase isn't that it is in the direction of a kind of reconstruction of Russia relations with the rest and you know the fundamental thing which we need is the integration of Russia into the Western system that's the fundamental thing we need I agree I think that well I agree with some of what you said I think we are seeing a conflict right now and it could be as you say transitional but we be there could be a reaction of what the Trump called the globalist forces but one of the reasons that in this speech and in his Helsinki speech the text is ignored and the gaffes and that song is is highlighted in the American media is in order to distract from his sensibleness of some of his ideas and to portray him as a lunatic and and with him by portraying him as a lunatic all of the ideas that anyone associated in any way with being critical of the Democratic establishment so the I would call the the global global liberal internationalist establishment in the United States is shocked at the fact that it is it is no longer seen it's no longer in power and no longer universally revered in the United States and and but it is retrenching and it's not giving up and it will see this fight with Trump to the end it's a very interesting after the helsinki's summit I noticed it was quite glaring to me is that even his inner circle the people around him did not defend him in public or tried to explain nikki Haley after the General Assembly she went on the on the cable stations and tried to convince them that the the people of world war laughing with Trump not against him okay or not as his expense and I think that's a together collectively what you're saying is very interesting because you know goodness I think that you know one of the Trump's problem says he's got many problems by the way but one of his problems is that you know he plays into the hands of his liberal globalist critics by doing two things firstly by embracing the elements that they're you know in the oak on you know adventurous militarist kind of a program and secondly don't by trampling all over multilateralism yes you trashy multilateralism in every kind and every opportunity guess and that's not that's not right you know it's possible to combine you know a concept of global politics based on nation states based on sovereignty and all that kind of thing with you know sensible forms of multilateralism which include United Nations includes multilateral groups of various kinds yeah it's a prerequisite if you're going to have multi serious multilateral agreements you need them to be among nation states that are sovereign unit feel themselves to that's that stand for something that they know what they're standing for well his whole discussion of sovereignty was quite peculiar in many ways because he was talking about how every country has a right to defend their sovereignty it's their responsibility to do so but then he was threatening the sovereignty of other countries that was rather contradictory yes you've spent some time recently in Ukraine elections are coming up Western media doesn't talk a lot about Ukraine these days what's going on there what's the political situation and what can we expect with the elections and Ukraine's relationship with the West and Russia that's about ten questions and one go ahead we started this discussion with the phrase the Gordian knot and at the heart of that Gordian knot between Russia and the West is Ukraine it's probably the central issue of contention between them that situation I fear is only going to be exacerbated next year at the end of this year next year precisely because of the presidential and then parliamentary election presidential of elections in March and then parliamentary elections in the fall right now the candidates are running to their respective extreme corners and that leaves the middle position the one where dialogue could take place a lonely place right now mmm but a shankha who in ran as the candidate who would end the war in a matter of hours and he could have gone to the dawn vast there was still that opening where he might have been able to do that yes and and he volunteered he would and and and he would eat but crucially he ran as a candidate for peace that peace has now been formally sanctioned as a resistance to Russian aggression and until Russia is defeated in this war that's increasingly the terminology zero-sum game right and and this is this is his new campaign platform but up at a shrink is running at six or seven percent of the popular vote I think his strategy now has to be to shore up his base which is very much a regional base that it's say in the West the only chance he has in my opinion of reaching a second round is to dominate and win in the West and gained enough votes that way and then veer sharply to try to reach out to the east and south where his popularity is nil essentially you know it is this another frozen conflict it's like I can't see a really a way out I mean I mean if you given the domestic politics in the rest of Ukraine here the compromises foreboding you can't compromise on these issues I very much hope it is a frozen conflict that seems to me at the moment in the short term better than the prospect quickly bring little bit of history back into this being related to Ukraine situation is one of the things that's not the comparisons often made between the Crimean secession from Ukraine and the Sudetenland German secession it's actually the wrong historical analysis correct historical analogy is what happens six months later in March 1939 when when Hitler sponsors the breakup of the Czechoslovak slate and the other I need depend Slovakia and German troops much into enterprise now you compare that with what Russia's role in Ukraine growing crisis did Russia occupy Ukraine or take over large parts of the country you know which could have done yeah easily know what it's done it Stratos actually tried to find a resolution at the conflict the civil war in Ukraine on the basis even of the separated hair is actually becoming part of Ukraine Ukraine again so it seems to me that's the best historical paracin and beauty in that lie russia has acted with huge restraint in relation to the leave so it's alright so that gives me some hope for the future yeah I'm concerned about what the Ukrainian actually going to do I'm concerned about the Western meddling and all that kind of thing but I'm hopeful that Russia is gonna you know try and contain and control the whole discussion in Russia during all of this so that it is a juxtaposition and the West's that Putin is doing too little I mean that's how far apart we are in looking at this here go ahead follow up on this point the Minsk Accords are the consensus view of all the signatories including Russia that the done boss must become part of Ukraine again the question arises why it's not that not yet happened I think one serious concern is that the Ukrainian government is extremely reluctant to see four to five million voters re-enter the pull of the political spectrum in Ukraine that are essentially up is in opposition to their view of Ukraine and as long as they can keep that at bay they can continue their current policies so they're so essentially that would be that I'm not assuming under any conditions that I can think of that Russia would accept the Donbass into the Russian Federation that's something that I don't think is going to have seems the Ukraine situation is only going to change if you're currently in domestic politics changes and it takes a turn for the better yeah that could be quite a long time in common we have one minute I heard this phrase once from a friend of mine the Ukraine has a nationalism without a nation how do you feel about that there is a Ukrainian nation but it is a pluralistic it is culturally plural nation and it doesn't want to recognize the current government does not want to recognize that cultural plurality it is there for defeating it's going against the grain of its own national history and identity 20 seconds to church one of the examples of this is the current effort to take the canonical of the status of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church which is the only canonical Church in Ukraine and destroy it and create a new National Church which will not be in communion with the rest of the Orthodox world an unprecedented evening even the church can't be left alone that's all the time we have gentlemen many thanks to my guests here in Moscow and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember cross tocqueville's
