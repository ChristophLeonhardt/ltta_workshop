1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,180
These 22 columns used to sit on the East Portico
of the United States Capitol building, before

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,540
they were moved … here.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,260
And as strange as they are, they’ve got
something in common

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,660
with every other Corinthian column.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,140
Something you have to look closer to see.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,480
These are acanthus leaves.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,840
Once you start looking for them, you'll notice
them everywhere.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,320
And  these leaves?

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,600
They say something about why we have decorated
columns in the first place.

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,399
Okay.

11
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,050
So there are different types, or orders, of
columns you run into in classical architecture.

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,350
The most important stuff is at the top part,
on what’s called the “capital.”

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,100
The three big orders are Doric — think super
basic.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,360
Ionic: look for the swirly things, called
volutes.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,180
And Corinthian — that’s where you want
to look for the leaves.

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,320
Composite is similar, but with the volutes
added in.

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,580
It’s a little much.

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,210
Corinthian columns probably entered the mix
around 550 BC, but through all these centuries

19
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,970
of change, the ornamentation at the top stayed
the same.

20
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,360
And those leaves?

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,260
They tell the columns’ story.

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,440
There's a myth behind the acanthus’s appearance
on columns.

23
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,050
It comes from the Roman writer Vitruvius.

24
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,930
His legend was that a young girl died.

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,900
In mourning, her nurse put the girl’s favorite
stuff in a basket

26
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,100
and set a tile on top of it.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,980
But the basket was placed on top of an acanthus
plant, which grew leaves that covered the

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,020
entire weave.

29
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,010
A sculptor named Callimachus saw it, got inspired,
and invented the Corinthian column.

30
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,350
Yeah, no … sure, Vitruvius.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,620
That’s what happened.

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,810
But the myth does speak to what made the acanthus
enduring.

33
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,110
It could grow from root cuttings.

34
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,780
These leaves showed up on Greek columns, though
many are now lost.

35
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,080
They popped up in Roman architecture as the
empire grew.

36
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,120
Some say the Greek and Roman columns had different
acanthus species, but stylization has erased

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,600
most of that distinction.

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,240
All the Corinthian columns’ versions reflected
the strength of the acanthus.

39
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,180
Eventually, the design of Corinthian column
became strong enough

40
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,760
to support itself through history.

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,810
The acanthus wasn’t a given.

42
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,790
This is the plan for the United States Capitol’s
hall of columns.

43
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,300
Along with acanthus, it includes tobacco leaves.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,980
Around the world, columns draw on different
ancient references, but in the West, referencing

45
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,200
classical ornamentation largely means following
the same template.

46
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:10,080
Often there’s creativity, as in this column
capital at Chartres, but almost always, acanthus

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
is in the mix.

48
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,720
These leaves don’t just symbolize the strength
of a plant.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,860
They’ve come to represent the endurance
of a culture’s design.

50
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:27,960
The Capitol building’s current columns still feature ornate

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,160
acanthus leaves.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,240
These columns were removed from the Capitol.

53
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,500
But acanthus leaves?

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,880
They may never be replaced.

55
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,320
So Vitruvius’s real interest in these columns
was probably more in the proportions than

56
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,920
in the leaves.

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,110
That makes sense when you know that he is
the person who was behind the Vitruvian man.

58
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,220
This guy.

59
00:03:57,340 --> 00:00:00,000
It feels like I’m dancing now.
