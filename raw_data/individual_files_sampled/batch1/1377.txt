Algeria's caspo or citadel founded on a hill in the country's capital on the ruins of past civilizations including the Berber the Roman and later Ottoman was made a unesco cultural world heritage site in 1992 but riddick era a local craftsman says the citadel and some of its features that make it such a treasured site are under threat we have to save craftsmen working inside the casbah because it's falling into rains we need to restore this area we urgently need help without help handicraft is going to disappear several types of crafts have already disappeared like the copper ware or the ornament makers authorities don't act to save it nothing will remain from the casbah like many of the people who live here Reda has worked on many of the structures in the casbah many of them especially those which date from the ottoman era are in an advanced space of disrepair Muhammad's Eyrie is one of the few young men to take up traditional crafts and has workshops here contributing to some restoration projects this kind of job is more threatened than ever there are fewer and fewer craftsmen here there are no schools to learn how to do it I would love any young person who has a father or a relative who was a craftsman to try to learn what they do so it can last there is a famous saying which goes like when parents die only the skill they teach to us remains some structures were built in the 16th and 18th century and follow the same pattern three stories around a central courtyard and a terrace on the roof Algerian authorities have listed age neglect and overpopulation as main contributors to the deterioration they see any work done to preserve the casbah will depend on the state of the structure but in an takuna no no and we decided that the priority was to restore ancient castles we also decided to restore ancient sites like Imams this operation cost a lot of money because those places were dilapidated buildings they were about to fall down so we decided to restore them it's a lot of money and expertise to do it was also very expensive the cosmos population has doubled in the last 50 years to 80,000 more than what it was originally designed to accommodate his own economy many people who were working here were old men most of them did not pass on any of their knowledge they are retired or worse many have died so fewer left to pass on the tradition tradition that is a major part in making this fortified place a UNESCO site but now people fear it could lose its title and they could lose their history Hiba morgan al jazeera
