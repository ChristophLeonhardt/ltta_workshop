they are there to generate revenue for the university that's their job well the books called the den trick because there really is quite the parallel between indentured servants and college athletes in the revenue sports which is football and men's basketball they go to universities where their movements and actions are severely restricted by the rules of amateurism and the NCAA they play a sport for one two three or four years and when they're done maybe they get an education and maybe they don't an athlete is in trouble with the NCAA fundamentally has no rights if he's accused of quote-unquote wrongdoing as the NCAA defines that term he's immediately made ineligible before there's any evidence charges interviews etc he has no rights to confront his accuser the university may have his back they may not have his back they may throw him under the bus and then when the punishment comes down there is a right of appeal but guess who rules on the appeal the NCAA if he wants to transfer has to either sit out a year in other words lose a year of eligibility or he has to get permission from his coach and the NCAA to waive the transfer rule so the NCAA restricts how many times you can eat in a person's house per semester the NCAA regulates whether your mother can take money to go on a college recruiting visit when you're in high school the NCAA regulates whether the course you're taking in high school is quote/unquote acceptable for college as if these bureaucrats in Indianapolis have any idea it's the sort of dictatorial nature of the organization that I fundamentally object to but the whole structure of the NCAA is built around the idea that however professional everything else is however much money Mike sous-chefs key makes which by the way is ten million dollars a year the athletes have to remain pure and untainted by commercialism even though by the way they're wearing logos for Nike and all sorts of other companies when they're on the court amateurism is is the essence of the NCAA
