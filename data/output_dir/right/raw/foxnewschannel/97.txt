1
00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:02,839
I'M ANITA VOGEL.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,376
JESSE: WE HAVE SEEN THEM ATTACK

3
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:08,645
CONSERVATIVES AND DESTROY

4
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:10,313
COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

5
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:15,385
NOW ANTIFA IS SINKING TO A NEW

6
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:16,019
LOW.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,788
ONE PROTESTER IS TARGETING A

8
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:25,628
WOMAN WHO LOST HER HUSBAND ON

9
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:26,596
9/11.

10
00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:29,999
>> YOU ARE [BLEEP] [BLEEP]

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,803
[BLEEP] I'M NOT LIKE YOUR

12
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,171
HUSBAND, I AM NOT GOING TO PUNCH

13
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:35,805
YOU.

14
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:39,509
I'M NOT LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND WHO

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,010
IS GOING TO PUNCH YOU.

16
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,745
>> MY HUSBAND DIED.

17
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:45,215
>> GOOD FOR HIM.

18
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:52,622
NCPD ARE A BUNCH OF SODOMIZING I

19
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:55,658
AM GRANTS WITH THEIR BULLY

20
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,962
STICKS.

21
00:00:58,963 --> 00:01:02,165
YOUR HUSBAND CAN ROT IN THE

22
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:02,465
GRAVE.

23
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:05,568
JESSE: I DON'T CONDONE VIOLENCE,

24
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,470
BUT THIS GUY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

25
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:09,873
KNOCKED OUT FOR WHAT HE SAID.

26
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,107
HE'S UGLY.

27
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:14,277
THIS IS THE FACE OF EVIL.

28
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:15,678
HOW DO YOU EVEN HANDLE SOMETHING

29
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:20,617
LIKE THAT OUT ON THE STREET.

30
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:23,152
>> SOMEONE DECIDED TO HANDLE

31
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:26,422
THAT LATER AND WALKED ACROSS THE

32
00:01:26,423 --> 00:01:28,224
STREET LATER AND SAID YOU

33
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:29,826
TALKING ABOUT MY MOM?

34
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:32,862
AND THAT GUY TURNED TAIL AND

35
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:34,697
RAN.

36
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:39,535
PICKING ON 9/11 VICTIM, THE

37
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:41,504
FIREFIGHTERS AND THE FIRST

38
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:43,072
RESPONDERS AND POLICE OFFICERS.

39
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:43,840
IT'S INSANE.

40
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:46,509
IT GOES TO SHOW YOU ALL HE WAS

41
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,812
TRYING TO DO WAS BULLY, HARASS,

42
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:52,749
REVOKE AND PUSH THIS WOMAN INTO

43
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,750
RESPONDING.

44
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:57,654
SHE SEEMED PRETTY CALM.

45
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:00,990
JESSE: HE WENT AFTER PRETTY MUCH

46
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:04,894
EVERYBODY, POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS,

47
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:06,229
WOMEN, DEAD HUSBANDS.

48
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,097
IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN

49
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:08,564
THAT.

50
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:10,466
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE

51
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:11,935
AUDIENCE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR

52
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:15,571
COMING FROM THE RADICAL LEFT.

53
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:16,806
BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT

54
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:18,741
THEY ARE UP AGAINST.

55
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:21,177
ON THE STREETS, YOU ARE UP

56
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:23,479
AGAINST THIS TYPE OF PERSON AND

57
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,280
IT'S SCARY.

58
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,449
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE STREETS

59
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,318
IT'S HAPPENING ON TWITTER AND

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,218
SOCIAL MEDIA.

61
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,853
PEOPLE ARE SAYING STUFF LIKE

62
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:32,822
THIS.

63
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:36,926
IT REMINDS ME OF MY TOM ARNOLD

64
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:39,295
DUST-UP WHERE HE WAS CALLING ME

65
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:41,097
A RACIST AND I RAN INTO HIM.

66
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:43,967
I SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

67
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:45,268
ABOUT?

68
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:46,836
I SAID I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT.

69
00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:49,472
HE SAID I DIDN'T MEAN YOU, I

70
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,374
MEAN THEY ARE USING YOU.

71
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,876
THEN AFTER THE DUST-UP HE GOES

72
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:55,478
ON TWITTER AND YELLING ABOUT HOW

73
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,181
HE SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED ME OUT.

74
00:02:58,182 --> 00:03:01,050
JESSE: HE WAS ON TWITTER TAKING

75
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:04,954
SHOTS, AND YOU GOT IN HIS FACE

76
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:11,961
AND SAID HEY, BRO, AND AFTER YOU

77
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,997
TALKED TO HIM HE'S BACK ON

78
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:14,330
TWITTER?

79
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:17,600
>> I CALLED HIM A COWARDLY,

80
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,135
SLANDEROUS WEASEL.

81
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:21,004
PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE ALLOWED TO

82
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:24,907
DO THIS BECAUSE MAXINE WATERS IS

83
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,976
SAYING CONFRONT PEOPLE, CHASE

84
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:29,946
YOUR SENATORS DOWN THE MALLWAYS

85
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:31,948
IN THE ELEVATORS.

86
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:34,150
IT'S COMING FROM SOMEWHERE AND

87
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,319
IT, DANGEROUS STUFF.

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,521
SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT AND

89
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,923
IT'S NOT GOING TO END WELL.

90
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:44,027
JESSE: THEY DON'T LIKE

91
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:44,560
CYBERBULLYING.

92
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:47,096
THEY ARE BIG AGAINST

93
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:48,664
CYBERBULLYING, BUT I GUESS THEY

94
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:50,533
ARE OKAY WITH BULLYING IN THE

95
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,334
STREETS.

96
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,636
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT RUSH

97
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:54,504
LIMBAUGH.

98
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:57,040
HE HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE

99
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,142
POSSIBILITY OF HILLARY BEING IN

100
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,810
THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

101
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:02,345
IT'S FRIGHTENING.

102
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:04,881
>> THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO MAKE

103
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,082
AMERICA GREAT.

104
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,284
THEY RESENT THE WHOLE IDEA OF

105
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:10,987
AMERICA BECOMING GREAT.

106
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:13,523
THEY RESENT THE IDEA OF AMERICA

107
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:18,394
AS A SUPER FOURTH FOR GOOD.

108
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:22,165
THE VALIDATION OF ALL OF THESE

109
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,635
ODDBALL WEIRD PERVERTED

110
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:27,537
LEFT-WING BEHAVIORS BECOME MORE

111
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,872
AND MORE NORMAL AND THE POLITICS

112
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:32,642
AND GOVERNMENT'S ROLE GOING TO

113
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:34,644
ADDRESS THEIR GRIEVE YANTSS?

114
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:36,779
HAVE WE BECOME A COUNTRY OF A

115
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,148
BUNCH OF VICTIMS, CONSTANT LIANG

116
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,850
ARE YOU DEMANDING SOMEBODY DO

117
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:43,953
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

118
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:46,355
JESSE: CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE HAD

119
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:47,156
PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON.

120
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:49,258
WE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOW ABOUT SPY

121
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:49,892
GATE.

122
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:52,328
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THIS GDP

123
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:53,196
GROWTH.

124
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:55,331
WE WOULDN'T KNOW ELIZABETH

125
00:04:55,332 --> 00:05:03,773
WARREN WASN'T NATIVE AMERICAN.

126
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:04,373
1/1024th.

127
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:07,477
I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH RUSH.

128
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:09,912
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING THERE

129
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:10,913
I DISAGREE WITH.

130
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:15,918
JESSE: HE'S RIGHT 99.9% OF THE

131
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,819
TIME.

132
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,493
YOU MUST DISAGREE WITH HIM ABOUT

133
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:23,860
THAT .01%.

134
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,229
>> HE SAYS SOME THINGS I THINK

135
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,396
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

136
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:30,032
BUT THAT I THINK IS SPOT ON.

137
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,901
I AM HAPPY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

138
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:32,668
OUR PRESIDENT.

139
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,537
I SHUTTER TO THINK OF THE IDEA

140
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:37,173
OF WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD

141
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:38,274
HILLARY BECOME PRESIDENT.

142
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:43,379
ALL THESE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

143
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,247
EARTHED.

144
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:45,348
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

145
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,916
I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THINGS

146
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:47,850
MOVING FORWARD.

147
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:49,719
I SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT.

148
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,254
JESSE: YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE

149
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:54,023
HAD YOUR BEAUTY REST.

150
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:56,926
LIMBAUGH ALSO PREDICTED THIS FOR

151
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:57,860
THE MID TERMS.

152
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,363
>> WE HOLD THE HOUSE AND

153
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:01,797
INCREASE THE SENATE.

154
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:02,932
I THINK THAT'S JUST.

155
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,201
I THINK THE DEMOCRAT PARTY

156
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:07,403
DESERVES TO LOSE IN THE SINGLE

157
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,939
BIGGEST ELECTORAL LANDSLIDE

158
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
DENEAT MY LIFETIME.

159
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:12,875
THE ACTIONS THEY HAVE TAKEN JUST

160
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,310
IN THE LAST MONTH.

161
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:16,879
JESSE: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

162
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,081
THAT THEORY THEY DESERVE TO LOSE

163
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,184
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY BEHAVED.

164
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:24,020
>> I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING

165
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,390
THEORY AND MAY HOLD TO WATER.

166
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:28,491
I THINK SO.

167
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:30,526
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT ON THE

168
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:33,462
LIMB AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE A

169
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:34,463
RED WAVE.

170
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:36,966
BUT THE DEMOCRATS AND THE

171
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,267
KAVANAUGH HEARING AND THE THINGS

172
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:40,503
THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING IS NOT

173
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:41,704
GOOD BEHAVIOR.

174
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,706
I KNOW WHERE MY VOTES ARE GOING.

175
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:44,607
I'M AN INDEPENDENT.

176
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,876
I KNOW WHERE MY VOTES ARE GOING.

177
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:49,212
THEY ARE GOING RED THIS NOVEMBER

178
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:49,445
6.

179
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:52,081
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

180
00:06:52,082 --> 00:00:00,000
IF THAT DOES HAPPEN, IT WILL BE
