1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Sonia you're not a primate scientist but
you're a very distinguished scientist

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,019
and astrophysicist what do you think
about when people say look this is not

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,679
settled science there are still
questions I sometimes think to myself

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,580
look there are a lot of questions still
about Einstein's theories that led to

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,240
nuclear fission but we still know that
nuclear power plants do operate and they

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,380
do provide electricity and yeah so
what's happening here is they're people

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,820
who have cultural political religious
economic philosophies that they then

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,030
invoke when they want to cherry-pick one
scientific result or another you can

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,090
find a scientific paper that says
practically anything and the press which

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,610
I count you as part of the press will
sometimes find a single paper so here's

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,199
a new truth if this study holds it but
an emergent scientific truth for it to

12
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,370
become an objective truth the truth that
is true whether or not you believe in it

13
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,930
it requires more than one scientific
paper it requires a whole system of

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,260
people's research all leaning in the
same direction all pointing to the same

15
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,030
consequences that's what we have with
climate change as induced by human

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,600
conduct this is a known correspondence
if you want to find the 3% of the papers

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,240
or the 1% of the papers that conflicted
with this and build policy on that that

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,150
is simply irresponsible and what how
else do you establish a scientific truth

19
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,220
if not by looking at the consensus of
scientific experiments and scientific

20
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,090
observations Abraham Lincoln the first
Republican President signed into law in

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,770
1963 a year when he had important things
to be thinking about he signed into law

22
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,960
the the National Academy of Sciences
because he knew that science mattered

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,729
and should matter in governance and and
it and you know we build our cities on

24
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,200
the basis of science we win you know
when when we fall ill we don't we don't

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,160
go to the local witch doctor right go to
a doctor even though all

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,000
that science is still you know I mean
there are advances gonna be made none of

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,640
it is settled in the sense well so you
know what it's settled you know it is

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,780
settled settled science is the science
that has come out of large bodies of

29
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,040
research that all agree when you see
scientists arguing and I tweeted I said

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,090
if you think scientists want to always
agree with one another you've never been

31
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,540
to a scientific conference because the
people are duking it out but what are

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,530
they fighting over not the settled
science that's been in the books we're

33
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,710
fighting over the the the bleeding edge
of what is not yet known and and that is

34
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,760
the natural course of science and a few
as a journalist want to eavesdrop on

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,420
that meeting you'll think scientists
don't know anything about anything but

36
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,330
is the body of knowledge that is
accumulated over the decades that

37
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,310
precedes this that becomes the Canon of
what if you're gonna base policy and

38
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,390
legislation on that's what you should be
thinking about so you would say this is

39
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,070
a moment to listen to climate science I
think this 50 inches of I can't even

40
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,850
picture
how many raindrops is that 50 inches of

41
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,500
rain in Houston this is this is a shot
across our about a hurricane the width

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,260
of Florida going up the center of
Florida these are these are shots across

43
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,350
our bow that what what will it take for
people to recognize that a community of

44
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,240
scientists are learning objective truths
about the natural world and that you can

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:41,450
benefit from knowing about it even news
reports on this channel talked about the

46
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,340
the fact that we have fewer deaths per
hurricane why because you now know weeks

47
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,780
in advance we have models that have
trajectories of hurricanes in a decades

48
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,920
gone by it was like there's a hurricane
there we don't know should I stay should

49
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,840
I go and then you stay and you die okay
so to cherry-pick science it's an odd

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,410
thing for a scientist to observe and I
don't I didn't grow up in a country

51
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,610
where that was a common phenomenon we
went to the moon and people knew Science

52
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:18,570
and Technology fed those discoveries and
the day to politicians are arguing about

53
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,430
whether science is true it means nothing
gets done nothing it's the beginning of

54
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,349
the end of an infant
to democracy as I've said many times

55
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,849
what I'd rather happen is you recognize
what is scientifically truth then you

56
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:37,300
have your political debate so in the
case of energy policy whatever it's you

57
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,740
you don't ask is the science right you
ask should we have carbon credits or or

58
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,430
whatever right response right exactly
what is the economic dimension of this

59
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,330
that's where the politics needs to come
in and it's not the longer we delay the

60
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:58,810
more I worry that we might not be able
to recover from this because all our

61
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,190
greatest cities are on the oceans and
water's edges historically for Commerce

62
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,770
and transportation and as storms kick in
as water levels rise they are the first

63
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,430
to go and we don't have a system we
don't have a civilization with the

64
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,690
capacity to pick up a city and move it
inland 20 miles that's this is happening

65
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,590
faster than our ability to respond that
could have a huge economic consequences

66
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,630
on that sobering note Neil deGrasse
Tyson always a pleasure and we are in a

67
00:05:25,630 --> 00:00:00,000
hurry to read the book thanks
