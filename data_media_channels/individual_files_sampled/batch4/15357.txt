today we're doing a deep down dive into a Canadian Border Services Agency audit and our own exclusive freedom of information documents that detail the failures of the Canadian government to effectively screen Syrian refugees today I'm going to tell you about some specific cases of fake or questionable refugees just being allowed into Canada an internal audit done by the CBSA detailed security gaps and failures in the Syrian refugee screening process that audit was heavily redacted but a full version was eventually leaked to the mainstream media and the mainstream media in turn devoted a few one-page stories to it but here at the rebel we decided that this issue deserved a much closer look we filed our own access to information requests for even more information and we also got access to that non redacted version of the audit now the speak already I've shown you the number of times that the government failed to screen those refugees and today I'm going to show you what some of those specific missed screenings really looked like on this accessed information document immigration refugees and Citizenship Canada says that they examined 100 files to confirm that every applicant meant the criteria to become a refugee to Canada now according to the document this included determining if the applicant was one Syrian if the applicant had fled Syria and lastly determining if the applicant had no other durable solution other than resettling in Canada according to the IRS CC they found that 100% of the cases met the criteria but further on in the document the IRC see notes that a number of cases the applicants had returned to Syria on one or more occasions this appeared to signal a situation where these individuals should have been deemed ineligible based on the criteria instead Immigration and Refugee officials said that for upper Syrian refugee a decision was then made to not universally apply this principle so it was special treatment for the Syrian refugees these refugees who claim to be in immediate danger were going back to Syria on one or multiple occasions for visits they can default that they were in that much danger and how in the heck can a government-sponsored refugee who claims to have nothing but the clothes on their back afford to take multiple trips back to Syria now let me tell you a story of one Syrian refugee that I found the information is heavily redacted but what the government left behind is enough to put together a tale of an unbelievably low criteria to qualify as a refugee to Canada this so-called refugee that I found suffered I guess inconvenience now this has been heavily redacted but we can sort of put together what happened here the principal applicant and his family espouse and five children with the ages redacted fled Syria when the living conditions became untenable as and then this is weird because it's pretty clear they've redacted his employment as a driver anyway the principal applicant had to pass through ten to fifteen checkpoints when transporting passengers so as far as we know he fled to Jordan because of the inconvenience the war was creating with his job as a driver the principal applicant fled to Jordan first to find accommodations for the family the wife was pregnant and remained with the children back in Syria so things were so bad in Syria for his family that he left his pregnant wife and children behind there what happened to women and children first now the refugee does claim that the neighborhood where he lived in Syria was subject to shootings and explosions but that was during the time the principal applicant the husband was away they say the security situation deteriorated so it deteriorated after he left his pregnant wife behind and fled to Jordan without her when the rest of the family finally got to Jordan the principle applicants sons were verbally harassed by students and teachers at a school and one of the sons arms was broken by several local students the family say they also faced ongoing verbal harassment from their neighbors in Jordan now this is terrible I'll admit but schoolyard fights bullying and bad neighbors do not make you a refugee especially if you're in Jordan now I found one instance of a refugee applicant who participated in demonstrations and said he was an honorary member of a group that was organizing the demonstrations now the documents on file indicated the applicant himself was never armed now that's according to the self reporting of the applicant but there is a reference on file to the protesters arming themselves and the group of which the applicant was a so-called honorary member coordinating the arming of the protesters the rules are you can't become a refugee if you are part of a militia or other non-government armed group or involved in those armed groups and then there was another less serious case of an applicant who was asked by Syrian rebels to write slogans on cardboard and sometimes he was given money in exchange for his services again that is involvement in armed groups making him ineligible and this next fake Syrian refugee was actually neither a refugee nor Syrian which clearly doesn't line up with what immigration refugees and Citizenship Canada is claiming to be a 100% compliance rate with that requirement to be Syrian just look at how unbelievable this is here in most cases it was apparent that refugees had no durable solution other than to be coming to Canada as a refugee however in two cases in our sample it was unclear why these two cases were not refused on durable solution criteria for one example one applicant appeared to be a Lebanese citizen as both he and his parents were born in Lebanon but it was unclear if this potential durable solution possibility had been considered by the interviewing officer the internal audit and Accountability Board note said it was unlikely an officer in the short operation Syrian refugee processing time used would have been aware of issues such as different country citizenship laws which would have been essential in determining whether or not refugees had durable solutions outside of Canada how on earth did that guy walk into a refugee intake office in Lebanon claimed to be a Syrian refugee and then just end up in Canada as one well I can tell you exactly how that happened right here on this page it says that Canada was receiving UNHCR referred Syrian refugees that were reviewed by the Danish Refugee Council in Lebanon and when the Canadian government audited 100 cases that were reviewed and approved by the Danish Refugee Council in Beirut only 59 cases actually met the criteria to become a Syrian refugee if this Lebanese guy could claim to be a Syrian refugee with actual documents to prove he's a citizen of Lebanon then it would be really easy for someone with no documents who happened to be a member of Isis to find their way into Canada by telling some sob story to it an inept UN worker who is only doing their job less than 60% of the time a 59 percent success rate is pretty terrible considering these are the people tasked with weeding out jihadis from the actual desperate refugees now these are just a few cases discovered in a small random sampling of Syrian refugees tomorrow I'm going to bring you the story of the obnoxious government's response to the problems in the Syrian refugee screening process for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read at the rebel we just reached 1 million YouTube subscribers it's a great accomplishment thanks to all of you but it also puts us on the radar of Silicon Valley who seemed to have a real hate on for us conservatives but we've got an answer to that problem we've developed our own rebel media mobile app you can get it on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store download it give it a whirl and take the other side of the story with you wherever you go you
