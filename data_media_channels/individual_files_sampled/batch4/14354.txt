a Canadian University professor comes to the defense of the thugs who comprise an tyfa yet another telling sad example that free speech is DOA on campus in a letter to the editor of Now magazine which is Toronto's leftist Bible or would that be quran cynthia levine raske a professor with the Department of Sociology at Queen's University in Kingston Ontario actually goes to bat for antifa if the letter was meant as a parody it would be hilarious Monty Python asked I daresay but the letter is heartfelt and that makes it disturbing I'll quote it verbatim in its entirety quote many people are critical of the anti-fascist activities who protest rallies like the one in Nathan Phillips Square on August 11th and quote actually there was no rally at Nathan Phillips Square on August 11th there was one scheduled but it was cancelled two days before August 11th nevertheless and Tifa well they still showed up you see they wanted to fight and by God just because their target was a wall that wasn't going to stop them from sucker-punching people so they took their anger out on selected members of the media such as photographers Samba Hall who was just doing his job as a shutterbug at the Sun check it out oh so much for that love Trump's heyday anyway back to Professor Levine Rask EES letter quote but they antiva are taking risks that the rest of us will not improve so-called minorities and anyone who happens to like democracy from very violent people end quote Wow you know what a convoluted paragraph like why does she put the word minorities in quotation marks is she suggesting there's no such thing as a minority well there are minorities nothing wrong with being part of a minority so what the heck is she suggesting weird and when she speaks of her love of democracy she seems to prefer a democracy that will not allow offensive free speech but a democracy without freedom of speech well that's really not much of a democracy at all and when she speaks of very violent people again it is the membership of an tyfa tossing around knuckle sandwiches that's what makes them the violent ones folks google anta five islands and you will be treated to a smorgasbord of despicable cowardly behavior the world over but somehow and Tifa members are the victims again it's just so weird but she continues quote the anti-fascist mask up because white nationalists photograph and film them so they can identify them and and attack them online and otherwise end quote well Wow again the prof is describing a tried and true and Tifa tactic this whole business of naming and shaming after all in addition to baseball bats these thugs also tend to pack cameras and our final piece of pithy prose is this quote many anti-fascist protesters are young people with a lot to lose including their jobs their housing their health their future we need to stop labeling these frontline activists since surely all of us are against white supremacy end quote again the professor's take is stunning for all the wrong reasons yes if young people lose their job their future etc because they're going to jail for committing assault well good they're criminals there are consequences to breaking the law as beretta would say don't do the crime if you can't do the time and what's this rubbish about the war against white supremacy for goodness sake somebody buy this gala calendar in a map we're in 21st century Canada not 1939 Nazi Germany shouldn't we be more concerned about oh I don't know radical Islam after all according to the religion of peace calm there have been more than 30 3,800 deadly attacks carried out by jihadis since 9/11 alone but apparently there's some skinhead in Saskatchewan living in his mom's basement that we really need to worry about Wow denial ain't just a river in Egypt it would appear by the way I did reach out to Professor Levine raske for much-needed clarification there was no response again not surprising those who hate free speech and applaud violence can never articulate themselves and her idiotic letter is the proof in the pudding oh well on the bright side at least I never put myself in a position in which professor Levine raske was able to smash in my head with a bike lock for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go
