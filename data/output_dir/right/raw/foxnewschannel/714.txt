READ ALL OF THE BOOKS AND IT'S

19
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,319
THEY ARE RISKING LIFE AND LIMB

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,420
ON THE PRAIRIE JUST ALONGSIDE

21
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:13,254
THE MEN.

23
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,957
OUTSIDE THE HOME AND SELLING

24
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:16,824
THINGS.

25
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:19,527
THIS WAS WRITTEN BY A WOMAN AND

26
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:21,262
THEY SAY THE BOOK REPRESENTS

27
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:21,930
OUTDATED CULTURAL IDEAS.

28
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:23,298
I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

29
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,300

NOTIONS ABOUT WOMEN AS WELL

33
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:38,646
WHICH IS WHY WE READ THESE

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,850
CULTURE, WHERE WE CAME FROM,

35
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,519
MISTAKES WE'VE MADE IN THE PAST,

36
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:51,226

37
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:51,559
AUTHOR.

41
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,634
FEMALE CHARACTER.

42

THE "ME TOO" MOVEMENT IS, WOMEN

43
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,171

44
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:04,939
THIS IS LIKE AN OLD WOMAN

45
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,808

46
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,276

48
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,483
MOTHER'S LIFE ON THE FRONTIER.

49
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:23,291
THEY DROPPED THE LOG ON HER LEG

50
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,892
AND SHE CONTINUES TO BUILD A

51
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,395
HOUSE WITH THE TWO OF THEM WITH

52
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:30,231
A BROKEN FOOT.

53
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:31,266
NOW THAT'S EQUAL RIGHTS.

54
00:02:31,267 --> 00:00:00,000
MY CONCLUSION IS, THESE PEOPLE
