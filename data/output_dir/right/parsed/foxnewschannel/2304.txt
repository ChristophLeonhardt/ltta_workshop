THAT I COULD SAY TOO.
IF I SAID THEM, HE'D NEVER BE
ELECTED AGAIN.
GRIFF: PRESIDENT TRUMP SLAMMING
MONTANA SENATOR JOHN TESTER
AFTER THE SECRET SERVICE
DISPUTED ALLEGATIONS AGAINST
RONNY JACKSON, SO IN A STATE
WHERE TRUMP WON 57% OF THE VOTE
JUST HOW VULNERABLE IS SENATOR
TESTER IN THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS
HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN DEPUTY
NEWS EDITOR ALEXIA MCHAMMOND HOW
ARE YOU?
>>  GOOD MORNING I'M GOOD THANK
YOU FOR HAVING ME.
GRIFF: THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG
RACE.
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO WHAT'S
NOW CLEARLY BEEN A RACE THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO PUT
ESSENTIALLY A BULLSEYE ON
SENATOR TESTER'S BACK?
>>  SENATOR TESTER IS PERHAPS
THE MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRATIC
SENATOR IN THIS 2018 ELECTION.
I'VE REPORTED ON THAT FOR AXIOS,
AS YOU JUST MENTIONED NOW TRUMP
WON HIS STATE OF MONTANA BY 20
POINTS IN 20156, BUT CHAIRED TO
TRUMP'S 58% IN A STATE WHICH IS
MUCH HIGHER THAN HIS NATIONAL
AVERAGE WHICH SUGGESTS AND SHOWS
THAT MONTANA LOVES THE PRESIDENT
AND YOU KNOW SENATOR TESTER IS
AN INTERESTING SENATOR BECAUSE
ALTHOUGH HE'S IN A VULNERABLE
POSITION, HE DOESN'T ALWAYS ACT
LIKE IT.
HE IS THE ONLY RED STATE
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WHO VOTED
AGAINST MIKE POMPEO AS SECRETARY
OF STATE AND IN JANUARY HE VOTED
TWICE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
FUNDING BILL SO I THINK WE CAN
FULLY EXPECT TRUMP TO SORT OF
PRIORITIZE HIS SENATE RACE AND
UNSEAT HIM COME NOVEMBER.
GRIFF: NOW SENATOR TESTER IS
ALSO WEIGHING IN PUTTING OUT A
STATEMENT HERE WHERE HE SAYS
IT'S MY DUTY TO MAKE SURE
MONTANA VETERANS GET WHAT THEY
NEED, AND HAVE EARNED AND I'LL
NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THEM AS
THEIR SENATOR.
YOU KNOW, SENATOR TESTER ONLY
WON THE 2012 RACE BY FOUR POINTS
AND HE'S A MODERATE GUY IN THE
MIDDLE TRYING TO PLAY BOTH SIDES
AS YOU POINT OUT BUT YOU KNOW,
HE HAD A REALLY BAD JANUARY DOWN
18 POINTS.
IS TESTER GOING TO BE A RACE
WHERE DEMOCRATS BEGIN TO PULL
RESOURCES OUT AND LET HIM FEND
FOR HIS OWN?
>>  I DON'T THINK WE CAN EXPECT
THAT.
I THINK IF ANYTHING WE WILL SEE
DEMOCRATS SORT OF ADDING
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BECAUSE WE
ARE SEEING HOW THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO GET INVOLVED.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS
THAT HELPED SENATOR TESTER.
ONE IS THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY
HAVE A STRONG FORMIDABLE
REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER, AND HE'S
OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE
ADMINISTRATION NOW AND THE STATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL DECIDED NOT TO
RUN SO I THINK UNTIL THAT
HAPPENS THAT COULD REALLY HELP
TESTER IN HIS FAVOR BUT I WOULD
EXPECT DEMOCRATS WOULD IF
ANYTHING ADD ADDITIONAL
RESOURCES TO HELP HIM.
