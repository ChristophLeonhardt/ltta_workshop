a girl called nor buys an ice cream and wins a ticket to visit a sweet factory hey you heard him in masala louder service Nabu so Halloween yet was no other fictional character in an animation made by an Israeli rights group but the factory and its owner Mohammed Al Barney are real and so are the many problems operating under the blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt us nor discovers them as Mohammed shows her around starting with a power cut electricity's off most of the time in Gaza during my visit Mohammed explained that since the siege began 10 years ago most of his production lines are closed most of the time he didn't want to fire any of his 400 staff and families depend on the wages some employees had their hours cut instead and as the animation also shows the machinery they use has problems too Israeli authorities restrict the import of anything they say could be used to make weapons the packaging is meant to be done automatically by this machine but it needs a spare part from Turkey that's not been allowed in this machine puts the cream filling in biscuits it needs a few technicians to come here and service it they're not allowed to come this whole production lines been down for four years some of the equipment needs to be sent to Germany for servicing and that's not allowed either the Mohamed doesn't believe the restrictions are just for security reasons this is do it to stop the dust real in the Gaza and to make the people is very bored that is the politic of Israel Israel's military assaults on Gaza in its conflicts with Hamas haven't helped either three years ago the factory was hit by an Israeli rocket Mohamed gifts the sweet factory to Noah but as she sees its problems becomes a story of shattered dreams the rights group that made it called gisha says 'add aim to inform people but also challenge stereotypes we wanted to be able to tell the story of movement and restrictions on the Gaza Strip and do it in a creative way so that we could attract new audiences and open people's eyes to the fact that there is a different reality inside of the Gaza Strip than the one they normally hear business has also been hurt by Israeli restrictions on exports Mohamed says trade won't pick up unless the siege ends at the end of the film nor makes everything right with her imagination in reality things aren't so simple and Gaza's industries are still crippled Malcolm Webb al-jazeera in the Gaza Strip
