00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,330
This past April, Google removed ads for numerous
Crisis Pregnancy Centers, because they were

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,230
misrepresenting their services and intentionally
misleading pregnant woman who were seeking

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,130
information about abortions.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,250
We’re aware of the fact that abortion is
a controversial issue with passionate people

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,810
on both sides and a lot of ethically grey
areas that even the most reasonable person

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,740
would have a hard time sussing out. But most
people can agree that there are ethical and

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,050
unethical ways to fight for a cause you believe
in. The accusation being made now by pro-choice

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,590
groups, and in the past by members of congress
and New York State’s Attorney General, is

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,149
that Crisis Pregnancy Centers are using unethical
practices to trick pregnant woman into hearing

10
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,980
their anti-abortion rhetoric. So, what are
Crisis Pregnancy Centers and why are they

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,770
coming under such harsh criticism?

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:53,260
Well, Crisis Pregnancy Centers are establishments
set up by Pro-Life organizations that offer

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,950
counseling and support to pregnant women - which
on its face, sounds relatively harmless. But

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,980
according to information uncovered by numerous
organizations, in practice, the support these

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,409
centers offer is exclusively designed to mislead
and discourage pregnant woman from considering

16
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,760
abortion as an option.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,439
A lot of these centers are funded by Heartbeat
International, who, according to their website,

18
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,090
“want[s] to make abortion unwanted today
and unthinkable for future generations”.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,140
In search of that goal, some of the facilities
they and other groups fund, are reportedly

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,770
spreading misinformation about the physical
and emotional effects of terminating a pregnancy.

21
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,520
They’re also keeping women from finding
out about all of their options, and showing

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,360
them inaccurate or misleading films or pictures
in order to shock or frighten them out of

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,340
seeking those options. Some are even tricking
women into delaying their decision on the

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,439
issue, because in most states - the longer
you wait, the harder it is to legally terminate

25
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,250
your pregnancy.

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,250
These facilities also look like medical offices
and are staffed with people who look like

27
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,000
medical professionals, even though most are
not trained or licensed to practice medicine.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,450
Their advertising also looks like ads for
facilities that offer a full range of care,

29
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,258
including abortions, but as we said, they
do not offer abortions and are intentionally

30
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:11,299
misrepresenting their services.
