if you want to offend about Muslims draw photos of Muhammad or pictures of Muhammad if you want to offend Christians in America have a themed Met Gala that centers around Catholicism now Bree Payton who writes for The Federalist had a little bit of a tizzy about the Met Gala because it was religiously themed in fact the theme was heavenly bodies fashion and the Catholic imagination right so look I'm not upset about what she wrote I'm amused by it especially the format in which she wrote this piece because she lists all the offender's and then she explains why what they're wearing is offensive so I'm gonna give you a few examples first there's Rihanna she writes Rihanna who was co-hosting the affair dressed as a sexy version of the Pope so let's look at a picture of the sexy version of the Pope well indeed that is sexier than the current now here's what uh Peyton writes about why this is offensive she says as the head of the Catholic Church the Pope retains authority over the church Catholics believe this authority has been handed down to him from Saint Peter who Catholics say was ordained as the first head of the church by Jesus Christ himself turning the Pope into a sexy look for a night night out says that the position Jesus created to lead the church is just a club dress yes I don't know look I'm not religious so I was offended by the metaphor other reasons which we'll get into in a sec but uh yeah I get it you don't have to give us a Catholic history we all know right a and the Pope does is the head of the Catholic Church oh really and so basically they don't she does not like them using art to depict Catholic Catholics in in a different light well I mean they'd be using art and in religion in art for centuries upon centuries about have you ever gotten a museum right no but chink that art has minimized religion two paintings now when I think of Catholicism I think paintings that's all yeah you know what I want to know is like super religious people which I was raised by super religious people why are you keeping up with the Met Gala like why are you like - uh researching what Rihanna wore it wouldn't even be in my radar when I was so you know because I'm not I wasn't allowed to be like this but what I what I thought was funny was that I love to hear people be so outraged when you disrespect the Catholic Church I want to read an article that she wrote about I'm trying to get some of those priests who molested children behind bars and I want to see the type of you know that type of outrage behind that let's hear a little bit more about st. Peter anyways ok so then she moves on to Lana Del Rey another example Lana Del Rey dressed as Our Lady of Sorrows a depiction of Mary in which she has daggers in her heart each representing a difficulty Mary experienced as the mother of Jesus there's Lana Del Rey daggers and heart and all and here's what she had to say Payton had to say about why this is offensive her role as the bearer of Christ makes it possible that men and women might be saved by her son's blood the pain she endured throughout her son's birth life and death are part of what makes salvation possible these sufferings are not a costume they're there's actual artwork of this yeah but the problem is that somebody in your contemporary period is wearing an outfit like that or is just keeping a tradition alive I think they want things ossified into a like very narrow and literal understanding of a time frame no but this is what it's really about like let's keep it 100 like there's a lot of disdain toward or a lot of disdain for people in Hollywood because they identify as liberal right you know they they have this themed Met Gala I don't think that they did this with the intention of insulting anyone and this is a form of art regardless of what you feel or think about fashion this is a form of art this is a form of expression I don't think anyone had the intention of of criticizing religion or making a mockery out of it and look the point that I want to quickly make is I think it's ridiculous that devout Muslims get as offended as they do when there are depictions of the Prophet Muhammad right now of course there have been cases of some taking things too far when they've gotten offended but you can't criticize you know the cultural issues there when you yourself get offended by something like this right and by the way when I'm incredibly secure about something someone's criticism even if someone outright criticizes that part of me it doesn't get under my skin because I'm confident in it right and so for instance when people say things like you're dumb okay all right you think I've done I know I'm not dumb right so I'm not gonna get offended by those kinds of comments but when it comes to religion for some reason people don't seem to be very secure in their own faith no I know why in any unit of course that's exactly what you're pointing to which is that they don't actually believe it so for example I'm an I'm agnostic I don't believe in any of the religions so if you weren't outfit that disagreed with me I would laugh and laugh say I don't care what you're wearing what would that have anything do with my beliefs my beliefs are based on logic and reason they totally detached from the fashion of the day what a preposterous thing to think that's because you don't actually believe it and you're a special little snowflake who wants to be a victim because in fact your religion is centered around this victimology like oh my god he was aged a suffered lady of sorrows and she we were saved by your blood what a weird weird idea if you're not brainwashed into religion it sounds insane oh she suffered and her son was drenched in blood and that was great for the rest of us that we were saved by it what okay and and the you wore an outfit that I didn't like so that affects my religion all of it sounds cuckoo for cocoa puffs but now I'm gonna shock the world I I do think that they do make one good point and and I know why but she said look if you they had the similar outfits about Islam or Judaism or anything else it wouldn't fly and that is true if they went in and like rabbinical outfits and and dress up as Orthodox Jews people would be like what on God's green earth are you doing right now the reason why they wouldn't is because Christianity is the dominant religion in America and they have power whereas my other religions don't and they're minorities so historically they've been picked on so you don't want to pick on them and it's easier and and makes more sense to you know to focus on the dominant religion but still that that is a fair point well I mean I would disagree with that I would say that was the charge that she was using and I have so many instances of the ways that either white women have appropriated wearing the headscarf or whatever political reasons but it yeah I I would push push back on that point a little bit I hear you sister two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos you
