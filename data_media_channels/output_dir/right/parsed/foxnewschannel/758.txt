LOVING HOME AND THERE'S NO SUCH
THING AS AN UGLY DOG.
>> THAT'S A PRETTY UGLY DOG.
I HAVE TO AGREE.
>>> THE POLITICAL DIVIDE IN OUR
COUNTRY REACHING NEW LOWS.
SARAH SANDERS KICKED OUT OF A
RESTAURANT FRIDAY NIGHT, JUST
FOR WORKING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WHILE ACTOR SETH ROGEN REFUSES
TO TAKE A PHOTO WITH FORMER
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN AND BERATES
HIM IN FRONT OF HIS CHILDREN.
IS THERE ANY WAY TO REVERSE THE
PERSONAL ATTACKS AND GET BACK TO
DISAGREEING RESPECTFULLY?
LET'S ASK OUR PANEL, FOUNDER OF
THE FLIP SIDE DOT I.O., ANAPI
WYHEAD AND EMILY COMPAGNO.
>> GOT IT.
>> THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
EMILY, I'LL START WITH YOU.
THIS PUBLIC CONFRONTATIONS OF
PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THEIR KIDS,
IN RESTAURANTS, IS THIS WHAT THE
RESISTANCE HAS COME TO?
>> IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS.
WHAT'S SO TROUBLING TO US IS
THAT IT'S SO HYPOCRITE CALL
THAT IT'S SO HYPOCRITEICALL
THAT IT'S SO HYPOCRITEICAL FOR
THE REASONS THAT THE LEFT SAYS
THE RIGHT IS SO REPULSIVE, WHICH
IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE
DEMONSTRATING.
WHAT SADDENS ME IS THE PLATFORMS
THAT -- AND THE OPPORTUNITY THAT
THOSE PEOPLE REFUSE TO TAKE,
WHAT IT DOES IS IT DOES A
DISSERVICE.
SETH ROGEN COULD HAVE USED A
PLATFORM TO SAY SPEAKER RYAN I
WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS MORE ABOUT
ALZHEIMERS AND TAKE A PHOTO
TOGETHER AND SAY AT LEAST THIS
WE CAN AGREE ON.
INSTEAD, IT'S A LOST OPPORTUNITY
TO ENGAGE AND DISCUSS AND,
AGAIN, FURTHER WHAT SHOULD BE
RESPECTFUL DISCOURSE.
>> HOW MUCH FALLS ON LEFT WING
LEADERSHIP.
THEY SCREAM IMPEACH 45.
THEN YOU SEE RANK AND FILE FOLKS
WHO OWN RESTAURANTS MIRRORING
THAT CONDUCT.
>> WHEN YOU DISAGREE WITH
SOMEONE ON THE LEFT, IT'S
INSTANT DISCOMMUNICATION.
THEY ARE DEHUMANIZING PEOPLE WHO
ARE REPUBLICANS.
THERE WAS A CONTROVERSY ABOUT
THE BORDER, DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION.
REPUBLICANS WEREN'T JUST WRONG
BECAUSE THEY HAD A BAD POLICY.
THEY WERE COMPARED TO NAZIS AND
TERRORISTS.
IT SHOULDN'T BE S OR
IT SHOULDN'T BE A OR
IT SHOULDN'T BE A SR
IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE WHEN
WE SEE BUSINESS OTHERS
DISCRIMINATING.
>> YOU SAY THERE'S A BIT OF A
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED
WITH SETH ROGEN AND WHAT
HAPPENED WITH SARAH SANDERS.
WHY?
>> SETH ROGEN DID NOT BEHAVE IN
WAY WE WOULD HOPE.
WE HAVE SETH ROGEN WHO IS
EXERCISING HIS FREEDOM OF
EXPRESSION OR NOT TO IN THIS
CASE, AS WE ALL A KNOW, A SINGLE
PHOTO CAN GENERATE A THOUSAND OP
EDS.
IF HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN
ENDORSING PAUL RYAN, I THINK
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM A BUSINESS
REFUSING SERVICE TO A GROUP OF
PEOPLE BECAUSE POLITICAL
BELIEFS.
THAT TO ME IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
>> IS THIS SOMETHING LIBERALS
HAVE SEEN FROM CONSERVATIVES OR
ARE THEY SEEING IT NOW BECAUSE
THEY HATE TRUMP SO MUCH, THEY
WILL DO ANYTHING THEY CAN AT ANY
LEVEL?
>> THERE IS AN OUTRAGE MACHINE
ON BOTH SIDES.
I THINK WE ARE GETTING CLOSER
AND CLOSER EVERY DAY TO THE
BRINK.
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE LESSON
MANY PEOPLE TOOK FROM THE 2016
ELECTION ON THE LEFT IS THAT
HALF THE COUNTRY IS SOME DISSHOW
NARROW MINDED OR BIGOTED.
WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO GO TO
THE NEGATIVE.
INSTEAD, WE SHOULD SAY HERE'S
WHY WE THINK WE ARE RIGHT.
>> THEY ARE BLINDED BY HATRED.
IMAGINE IF YOU SAID THIS, YOU
WOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.
YOUR FAMILY WOULD BE ASHAMED OF
YOUR C THIS IS THE LEVEL WHICH
IT HAS COME TO.
YOU CAN'T JUST LIKE PRESIDENT
TRUMP OR THINK HE'S DOING A GOOD
JOB.
YOU ARE EVIL, YOU ARE WRONG WITH
YOU SUPPORT HIM.
>> THANKFULLY, NOT MANY PEOPLE
WATCH MORNING JOE.
EMILY, KRISTEN NIELSEN, AT A
RESTAURANT, SCREAMED AT OUTSIDE
OF HER HOME, PROTESTERS GOING AT
HER.
HERE'S A PICTURE OF WHAT
HAPPENED TO HER AT A MEXICAN
RESTAURANT.
EVERYONE'S POINTING OUT THE
SO-CALLED IRONY THAT HOW SUDDENC
SO-CALLED IRONY THAT HOW SUDDENU
SO-CALLED IRONY THAT HOW SUDDEND
SHE BE AT A MEXICAN RESTAURANT
WITH THE POLICY THAT'S ARE AT
THE BORDER.
SHOULDN'T WE BE ABLE TO SEPARATE
THE PRIVATE OPPORTUNITY FOR
PEOPLE TO HAVE A MEAL AND THE
POLICIES THEY ARE PURSUING?
>> YOU WOULD THINK SO.
I THINK THE PERSPECTIVE HAS BEEN
REDUCED TO SUCH A SINGLE
DIMENSIONAL VIEWPOINT.
SAUDI ARABIA JUST LIFTED THEIR
BAN ON WOMEN DRIVERS ON FRIDAY.
NOW WE HAVE THE MEDIA DISSECTING
THE FURTHER LADY'S JACKET.
THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN REDUCED
TO A SINGLE PHOTOGRAPH OR SINGLE
SOUND BITE.
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND
NUANCED -- THE ENGAGEMENT WOULD
FOSTER A BENEFIT TO EVERYONE.
EVERY ISSUE HAS SO MUCH MORE TO
IT.
INSTEAD IT'S REDUCED TO YELLING
SHAME AT A RESTAURANT.
I POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THE HE
PROTESTS HAVE BEEN DIRECTED
TOWARD FEMALE GOP PARTICIPANTS
AND ELECTIONED OFFICIALS.
>> VERY INTERESTING POINT.
WOULD THE SAME CONDUCT EVER BE
TOLERATED AGAINST FEMALE MEMBERS
OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OR
OBAMA HIMSELF.
I THINK THE QUESTION ANSWERS
ITSELF.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS
