1
00:00:00,437 --> 00:00:02,472
JENKINS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2
00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:03,306
JUST A PREVIEW OF WHAT WE ARE

3
00:00:03,306 --> 00:00:04,875
GOING TO SEE TOMORROW NIGHT.

4
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:05,675
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

5
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:06,576
WE LOOK FORWARD SEEING YOU

6
00:00:06,576 --> 00:00:08,278
TOMORROW NIGHT ON THE BIG STAGE.

7
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:12,949
NOW WE HAVE WEST VIRGINIA

8
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:13,650
ATTORNEY PATRICK MORRISEY.

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,585
I JUST WANT TO TELL EVERYBODY AT

10
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:16,586
HOME THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT

11
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:18,121
OF DELAY IN A SINGLE, SO THERE'S

12
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,456
GOING TO BE HESITATION BETWEEN

13
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,891
MY QUESTIONS AND YOUR ANSWER.

14
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:22,692
THE FIRST OF ALL, WHAT DO YOU

15
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:23,827
SAY TO EVAN JENKINS WHO YOU JUST

16
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:24,327
HEARD?

17
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:27,898
HE SAID YOU WOULDN'T COME AROUND

18
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:29,666
THE, YOU NEVER SUPPORTED

19
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,467
PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING THE 2016

20
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,836
ELECTION AND DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM

21
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:33,236
ELECTION AND DIDN'T VOTE FOR HI

22
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:35,272
HIM.

23
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:36,873
>> WELL, LIKE MOST WEST

24
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:37,541
VIRGINIANS KNOW THAT EVAN

25
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,009
JENKINS IS JUST REALLY

26
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,711
STRETCHING THE TRUTH AT A LEVEL

27
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:44,080
HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

28
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,216
FIRST, I WAS A MEMBER OF THE

29
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:46,950
ELECTORAL COLLEGE THAT SUPPORTED

30
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,286
DONALD TRUMP.

31
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:50,086
EVAN JENKINS CANNOT SAY THAT.

32
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:51,288
THAT POSITION IS ACTUALLY

33
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:53,290
RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO ARE

34
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,025
REALLY TRUSTED TO VOTE FOR THE

35
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:55,392
PRESIDENT.

36
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,928
SO NOT ONLY DID I VOTE FOR HIM

37
00:00:57,928 --> 00:00:58,862
IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, I

38
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:00,864
VOTED FOR HIM AT THE CONVENTION.

39
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:02,432
I DID ADS COMPARING MYSELF TO

40
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:04,867
HIM IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.

41
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:05,769
WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE HERE IS A

42
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:09,873
VERY DESPERATE CANDIDATE EVAN

43
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:10,707
JENKINS, HIS LIBERAL BACKGROUND

44
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:11,208
IS BEING EXPOSED.

45
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,409
EVAN LINCOLN

46
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:15,679
JENKINS WAS FOR PLANNED

47
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:19,082
PARENTHOOD, STUMPED FOR

48
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:20,050
JOHN KERRY, RALLIED FOR

49
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,484
HILLARY CLINTON, SUPPORTED

50
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:22,686
NANCY PELOSI.

51
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:23,286
THIS IS A VERY LIBERAL

52
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:24,888
BACKGROUND.

53
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:25,622
I THINK AS MORE WEST VIRGINIANS

54
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:28,058
ARE LEARNING ABOUT MY

55
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:29,526
CONSERVATIVE RECORD, STANDING UP

56
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:31,661
FOR THE UNBORN, MOST PEOPLE NEED

57
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:32,696
TO KNOW THAT I AM THE ONLY

58
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:35,465
ENDORSED CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE

59
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:36,566
BY WEST VIRGINIANS FOR LIFE AND

60
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:39,069
THE SECOND OF THEM IN ALL THE

61
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:39,769
CONSERVATIVES ARE COALESCING

62
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,072
BEHIND MY CANDIDACY.

63
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:43,540
AS THAT HAPPENS, I THINK EVAN

64
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,675
JENKINS IS JUST GETTING VERY

65
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:46,409
DESPERATE MAKING UP A LOT OF

66
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,877
LIES.

67
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:50,580
I THINK FOX DID A VERY GOOD JOB

68
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,215
EARLIER TODAY CALLING EVAN

69
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,183
JENKINS OUT ON PHOTO SHOPPING

70
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:56,553
AND ADD WHEN EVAN JENKINS WAS

71
00:01:56,553 --> 00:01:57,587
THE ONE WHO RALLIED FOR HERE WE

72
00:01:57,587 --> 00:01:58,088
CLINTON.

73
00:01:58,088 --> 00:01:59,356
I THINK PEOPLE ARE SEEING

74
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:02,459
THROUGH HIS NONSENSE.

75
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,127
I THINK NEXT TUESDAY WE ARE

76
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,663
LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A GOOD

77
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:07,831
WIN IF THE PEOPLE OF

78
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:08,664
WEST VIRGINIA GRANT IT TO US.

79
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:09,833
>> Martha: YOU GUYS ARE GOING

80
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,036
AT EACH OTHER PRETTY HARD.

81
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:14,704
AND PEOPLE WILL SEE IT TOMORROW

82
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:15,872
NIGHT, A VERY INTENSE BATTLE

83
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:17,674
GOING ON IN WEST VIRGINIA.

84
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:19,676
NEITHER ONE OF YOU TWO SEEM TO

85
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:20,343
BE TALKING ABOUT DON

86
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:20,744
BLANKENSHIP.

87
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:22,679
WHY IS THAT?

88
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,414
>> LOOK, I THINK RIGHT NOW I'M

89
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:27,250
PUTTING FORTH MY POSITIVE

90
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,917
CONSERVATIVE VISION FOR THE

91
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,086
STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA.

92
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:31,554
I THINK YOU ARE SEEING BOTH OUT

93
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:32,489
OF DON BLANKENSHIP AND EVAN

94
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,658
JENKINS ARE A LOT OF THE ATTACK

95
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:34,924
ADS.

96
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,027
WE HAD A LOT OF POSITIVE ADS UP.

97
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:39,329
WE HAVE SOME CONTRAST AS WELL.

98
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,864
BUT I AM EMPHASIZING MY RECORD

99
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:41,731
BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE

100
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,668
RACE THAT HAS THE PROVEN

101
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:45,335
CONSERVATIVE RECORD AND THE

102
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:47,871
CONSERVATIVE ENDORSEMENTS.

103
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:50,273
I THINK LATE LAST WEEK WITH

104
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:50,940
SENATOR TED CRUZ COMING ON

105
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,942
BOARD, SENATOR RAND PAUL.

106
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:54,711
OBVIOUSLY ALL THE MAJOR

107
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:55,712
CONSERVATIVE LEADERS IN THE

108
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:56,780
STATE ARE RALLYING BEHIND MY

109
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,747
CANDIDACY.

110
00:02:57,747 --> 00:03:01,951
THAT IS WHY WE PROJECT A VERY

111
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:05,855
POSITIVE VISION THAT DON

112
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:06,323
BLANKENSHIP CAN.

113
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:08,458
>> Martha: WE WILL SEE.

114
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,859
BEAGLE HE HAS A VERY DEEP

115
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:10,293
LIBERAL PAST.

116
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:10,960
>> Martha: I PROMISE YOU YOU

117
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,195
WILL HAVE MORE TIME TOMORROW

118
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:14,064
NIGHT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

119
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,065
HAVING YOU ALL ON STAGE, ALL OF

120
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:18,802
THESE GENTLEMEN WHO HOPE TO BEAT

121
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:19,469
JOE MANCHIN IN TURN

122
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,470
WEST VIRGINIA INTO A REPUBLICAN

123
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,371
SENATE STATE, SO WE'LL SEE HOW

124
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,640
THIS TURNS OUT.

125
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,108
DON'T MISS IT.

126
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:25,809
TOMORROW NIGHT, WEST VIRGINIA

127
00:03:25,809 --> 00:00:00,000
SENATOR DEBATE.
