The quilts have been part of this 
work for years already.
We've been making them for
about three years.
We gather people together in these 
sewing bees across this country
and in Australia and Taiwan.
The atmosphere kept changing as, of
course, the light changed,
and the moods change and the shifts
change and I just mean mood
in terms of light and how
the night shifts.
The relationship between the performers 
and the audience is
very much that we are all here together.
We have gathered here together.
We are in this together.
I wanted people in the morning, as the 
sun came up,
to just be able to step into this new day 
changed and ready.
