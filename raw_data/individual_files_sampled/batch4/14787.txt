when the bullied to become the bullies for the second year in a row the United Conservative Party has been blocked from participating in a Pride Parade the United Conservative Party's application to participate in the capital city Edmonton's Pride Parade in June has been denied by event organisers according to a press release put out by the Pride Festival the UCP s request for participation did not speak to any direct action they've taken or will take to support the inclusion of all segments of the LGBTQ 2's plus community so pride just banned conservatives citing the Conservatives failure to support the inclusion of all the segments of the LGBTQ 2's plus community let me say that slowly in a different way pride banned conservatives including gay conservatives because they aren't inclusive of everyone say what now self awareness is really really hard for the left but this isn't the first time that pride has banned the UCP last year citing while pretty much the exact same excuse Calgary pride banned the UCP from participating but then they said the UCP were welcome to watch from the sidelines how nice and last year Calgary's Pride Parade president and executive producer Jason Kingsley wrote a letter to the UCP saying we would like to encourage a collaborative learning opportunity prior to participating as parade entries Kingsley said if the you see peacock has demonstrated a commitment to the community through their platform and policies and then takes part in pride training sessions provided by the Calgary sexual health center UCP MLAs could join in future parades yeah that's right last year Calgary's Pride Parade demanded that the UCP participated in reeducation training and then prove ideological purity in their official platform that wasn't even developed yet do you know what I am old enough to remember when the gay community was vehemently against conversion therapy but this sounds a heck of a lot like ideal conversion therapy to me anyway of course again this year the NDP are making political hay of all of this the party of inclusion and diversity and their leader just going to be more pleased to see conservatives and notably gay conservatives being discriminated against by the official gay community in Edmonton premier Notley said it's hardly surprising that a celebration that is designed to support LGBTQ kids adults and families across the province would resist having a party that clearly doesn't stand with them but back in reality the gay conservative outreach group LGB Tory is in Red Deer for the UCP AGM throwing a pub night and networking with other conservatives and unlike the Edmonton and Calgary pride parades they say everyone is welcome at their event and let's not forget about the fabulous blue tent parties they've been prominently featured at federal conservative conventions now the parties celebrate the prominence and prevalence of gay conservatives with organizers saying they found more acceptance with conservatives for being gay than they did with the LGBTQ community for daring to be conservatives now these are the folks that pride is excluding with their decision normal people who care about jobs and taxes and freedom who also just incidentally happened to be gay and what a disgusting slander from Rachel Notley against UCP leader Jason Kenney to say that he's never done anything for the LGBTQ community you see what Rachel Notley doesn't want you or anyone else to know is that Jason Kenney as Canada's immigration minister announced and funded a pilot project to help refugees who were persecuted for their sexual orientation Citizenship and Immigration Canada under Jason Kenney worked with the rainbow' Refugee Committee to split the cost of sponsoring gay lesbian transgender transsexual and bisexual refugees into Canada the funds were directed primarily at 77 countries that criminalize homosexuality and five countries that prescribed the death penalty for being homosexual UCP leader Jason Kenny's program saved the lives of people like Raj mozi he's an Iranian Kurd who had been caught with his boyfriend and then imprisoned for three months where he was tortured and abandoned by his family he eventually escaped to Turkey and then became part of Canada's rainbow refugee program and Waite made his way here to safety and Jason Kenney helped save the lives of truly persecuted sexual minorities and what did not lead ooh like what did she really do besides use other people's orientations as a political weapon and now Kenny's being bullied by sexual minorities whose feelings are hurt because Kenny doesn't think the same way as them about I don't know the environment or pipelines and parents rights you see if Jason Kenny were on the left he would be the pride parade marshal for all that he has done to protect the lives of those in the LGBT community from prosecution persecution and death abroad but he's a conservative and you see peers including gay ones are being shunned by this community with an alleged commitment to diversity and that's how I know this isn't about gay rights anymore this is about politics sleazy politics the gay pride parade at least in Edmonton and as far as I know last year in Calgary has basically devolved into an NDP support group for sexual minorities and they're preening socialist trends excluding people based on their political beliefs is not diversity and it's certainly not tolerance it's the opposite of Tolerance how can it be tolerance when the organizers are demanding ideological homogeneity from participants discrimination based on inclusivity enforced sameness in the name of diversity the bullied have become the bullies and the more they do things like this the more normal people see pride for what it really is now an NDP March with rainbows for the rabble media I'm Sheila Gunn read what you just saw there is my daily video that I do here at the rebel but did you know
