hey remember this show well what was once just Network TV sitcom fluff in the mid 90s and early 2000s is now politically incorrect Dogma well at least according to those who make up the Millennial Generation some of whom claim that the plot lines of friends can trigger them yeah friends well though was enormous ly popular back in the day I wasn't a big fan of friends just the idea that a bunch of 20-somethings many of whom were presumably earning minimum wage were somehow able to afford lavish manhattan lofts at wouldn't be out of place in the pages of Architectural Digest well that was just too much of a realism hurdle for me to overcome nevertheless friends had a big fan base all the actors were easy on the eyes and they occupied a parcel of the TV universe where I suspect many members of the audience wish they could reside in given the drudgery of their own real lives so you ask yourself what's not to love well along comes a recent article in the independent about Millennials discovering or rediscovering friends on Netflix and guess what they don't like what they're seeing for them this relatively tame show is sexist homophobic transphobic it even engages in gasp fat shaming indeed many bum owned plot lines that are simply too insensitive towards the LGG BD t TT iqq aap and sometimes why community for example that episode when Chandler was paranoid about being perceived as a gay man or when he made jokes about his cross-dressing dead well that may have been funny circa 1999 but today it almost qualifies as a hate crime I guess just check out some of the reactions by generations snowflake in the Twitterverse states Amy rewatching friends on Netflix and damn never realized just how annoying and homophobic Ross was was stuff like this and then there was this lament from Christine Carr I was a uni student in the 90s so look forward to rewatching friends on Netflix over new year but I agree the fad Monica and gay Chandler jokes feel very out of place now and was Joey always this creepy disappointing you know I think Christine's lament is very revealing and perhaps suggests why the Millennials are triggered by friends as she states when she entered university she actually enjoyed the show but after five years or so a progressive Dogma being crammed into her noggin she'd been reprogrammed so it is that a TV show that once generated laughter now results in stress Wow and of course this being the post Harvey Weinstein era some Millennials really lost it regarding an episode in which Rachel hired an assistant who wasn't qualified for the position he was interviewing for but gave him the job anyway because well she wanted to date him many Millennials clamor there's nothing funny about that storyline and the episode should have ended with Rachel be fired for sexual harassment okay reality check here Rachel is played but is played by Jennifer Aniston in her prime I know we're not supposed to even contemplate such thoughts but just how many heterosexual guys on the planet would take offense to being harassed by a Rachel so sorry but if a boss like Jennifer Aniston were to harass me I think I might be mistaken into thinking I just won the lottery but the freakout over friends only shows how much the world has allegedly changed in just a few years I recently lamented in this space how last fall Toronto Star calmness Johanna schneller be mowed the return of the brilliant Curb Your Enthusiasm series after a six-year hiatus the reason the comedic themes inherent to curb our way to politically incorrect for today's fragile audiences you know I have to wonder what the Millennials would say if they were to ever stumble upon an old episode so Duvall in the family from the 70s like this one in which Archie Bunker offers his take on evolutionary theory look at your cave women why do you think you cave women was created with short legs and fat butts I don't know us but I'm sure you got a good answer so they couldn't run fast so the men could catch him and force them to make the meals in a baby will warrant there any cave women with long legs and skinny butts that could run faster than the men well LEM the men that have to bring down with a rock now I'm starting to catch on and what about the cavemen with short legs and fat butts that couldn't catch any women well name is probably your face FIGS you know could all the family even be made today I wonder because it seems the millennial generation apparently can't get through life without being triggered even by fictional sitcoms that once aired on network TV in primetime the Millennial mantra seems to be I exist therefore I am offended but I think their endless fragility and fretting is starting to trigger the rest of us for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a premium rebel subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
