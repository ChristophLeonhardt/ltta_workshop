SENATOR JOE DONNELLY AND THOSE
ARE THE GENTLEMEN WHO ARE TRYING
TO 1 AGAINST HIM IN NOVEMBER.
AS WE SAID, WEST VIRGINIA,
CONGRESSMAN EVAN JENKINS
INTERNAL PATRICK MORRISSEY HOPE
TO BEAT DON BLANKENSHIP.
AS A RESULT, HE IS GAINING SOME
TRACTION.
JOINING ME NOW ATTORNEY GENERAL
MR. MORRISSEY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS EVENING.
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU
TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
>> WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU.
EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU SAID
TODAY ABOUT WHAT SEE AS CAMPAIGN
VIOLATIONS FROM THE BLANKENSHIP
CAMP AND WHY YOU REACHED OUT TO
HIS PAROLE OFFICER IN NEVADA?
>> COUPLE OF THINGS.
VERY BIG ISSUE, DON BLANKENSHIP
HAS A HISTORY OF IGNORING THE
RULE OF LAW.
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT HIS
CRIMINAL CONVICTION RELATING TO
THE CONSPIRACY TO VIOLATE MINING
STANDARDS.
WHEN YOU FILE AS A U.S. SENATE
CANDIDATE, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
SUBMIT YOUR PERSONAL FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURES.
YOU'RE WEALTH, YOUR INCOME, YOUR
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DON
BLANKENSHIP IGNORING THAT.
THAT COMES WITH POTENTIAL CIVIL
AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
HE JUST BRUSHING IT OFF LIKE
IT'S NO ONE'S BUSINESS.
THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION
FOR VOTERS SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY
KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT
YOU.
YOUR FINANCES AND YOUR CONFLICT
OF INTEREST.
>> HIS PAROLE OFFICER SAID HE
DOESN'T SEE THIS AS A VIOLATION.
WE KNOW THAT DON BLANKENSHIP HE
DOESN'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT
CANDIDATES HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT
INFORMATION.
DO YOU THINK VOTERS CARE THAT
MUCH IN WEST VIRGINIA, WHETHER
OR NOT HE DOES THIS?
>> I THINK VOTERS CARE IF HE
JUST IGNORED THE RULE OF LAW.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEING FROM
DON BLANKENSHIP.
HE'S BEEN WEAVING THIS TAIL
DURING HIS CAMPAIGN.
I THINK PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO
KNOW, ESPECIALLY PRESIDENT
TRUMP, DOMINATING DON
BLANKENSHIP WILL BE DISASTER FOR
WEST VIRGINIA.
HE'LL BE DEFEATED BY JOE
MANCHIN.
WE'RE SEEING MORE PEOPLE FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES DOWN.
>> THIS IS YOUR OTHER OPPONENT,
EVAN JENKINS TALKING ABOUT WHY
YOU ARE TURNING YOUR IRE AGAINST
DON BLANKENSHIP.
IT WAS MOSTLY JENKINS VERSUS
MORRISSEY AND BLANKENSHIP ON THE
SIDE.
HE'S RISEN IN THE POLLS
>> PATRICK MORRISSEY IS
DESPERATE.
HE'S TAKING SHOTS AT DON
BLANKENSHIP.
HE'S BEEN ALL OVER THE BOARD.
IT'S A CLEAR INDICATION HIS
CAMPAIGN IS ON LIFE SUPPORT.
THE POLL SUGGEST HE'S IN A
DISTANT THIRD.
PATRICK MORRISSEY IS DESPERATE.
HE'S TRYING TO ATTACK ANYBODY.
>> YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT?
>> SURE, I THINK IT'S PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD.
VOTERS KNOW ABOUT EVAN JENKINS
LIBERAL RECORD.
RIGHT NOW, BLANKENSHIP AND I ARE
CLOSE RACE.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
EDUCATE PEOPLE.
BUT THE MOST CRITICAL THING WITH
24 HOURS TO GO, PEOPLE SHOULD
KNOW, I HAVE THE STRONG
CONSERVATIVES WEST VIRGINIA FOR
LIFE.
SECOND AMENDMENT GROUPS.
PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT
TO THE POLL AND ENSURE THAT A
PROVEN CONSERVATIVE WIN AGAINST
A LIBERAL AND CONVICTED
CRIMINAL.
>> WE'LL SEE.
