okay I don't even know where to start so the studio's just can't seem to help themselves Jurassic world of fallen kingdom falls victim to the left to Saurus and will cost the studio millions in box-office revenue I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood okay so basically critics and audiences alike don't like this movie as much it opened up 25% less the original and all the earlier views admit that it's a very far left movie and conservatives won't like it so how do I explain how this happened the best way to sum this up is basically if a women's March decided hey the NFL makes tons of money let's take over the field and see if the crowd likes it and what I mean by that is the first movie Jurassic roll is the fifth highest grossing movie ever the box office yes it's cheesy but it has some fun moments and gave most people what they wanted so do they ride the wave of their new fans no of course not they listen to the loudest shrieking critics claiming the movie is sexist and change everything about it brilliant plan who as a viewer it's a 2 out of 5 a critic it's a 1 out of 5 and faith and values is a 1 out of 5 this movie is not worth breaking down in various ways so I'm gonna tell you why this movie fails I want to show you why diversity of character not ethnic diversity is so important why character needs to act believably in the scenes and how the Fallen Kingdom falls victim to the leftist Soros let's get into character diversity and why it's important one character in particular was attacked yes Chris Pratt was an example of sexist men and was an archetype of a patriarchal man but Clare the leading woman played by Bryce Dallas Harper was a victim of the most criticism why because she needed help and she wore high heels oh but here's why I worked for most everyone except these crazy shrieking critics the character Claire in spite of being shackled by the patriarchy is a CEO and a powerful woman she's driven she's type-a she's a perfectionist she's driven she's all these things and she's the head of the entire part and that's what's different about her character but when this seat of power and authority comes crumbling when the park starts to fall apart and she's thrust into the jungle now she's a fish out of water still having to wear the dress and the heels of this other world that she fell from and this forces her together with the rugged messy wrapped a wrestling oh and played by Chris Pratt tada and now these two very interesting different characters are forced on a journey together that's drama that's interesting that's what we like in movies now in this movie she literally goes from being a politician like Harvard Graduate CEO to now a woke social justice warrior who is a dinosaur rights activist wearing combat boots in a ponytail rights activist hmm and now when she's forced in with Chris Pratt she really doesn't need him he doesn't have to be there and they look dressed and act exactly the same there coolly comparable in every situation it is so boring to watch basically the left is just wrapped up in diversity of sex and gender and cared nothing about diversity of characters they want every character to be exactly the same and the next and most obvious part of this movie that choked harder than the last Jedi did was how they made their characters so unrealistic here's something for you in case you get blackmailed into watching this movie every time something happens just ask yourselves why why would he do that why would she do that why would that happen and he'll be like aha because they wanted it to happen that way for example the villains become so stereotypical and unbelievable to watch I mean as soon as you see the angry white men wearing aviators or the young wealthy white guy claiming to want to do the right thing you're like yeah this is as deep as it's gonna get the motivations are so weak and predictable they're so flat that the villain literally has to explain why he's doing what he's doing constantly cuz it makes no sense that's half his dialogue it makes every scene is boring in as empty as a Lance Armstrong apology the military guys are so forced into being the bad guys that even after the only people that save the dinosaurs broke PETA and netting the government wasn't gonna do the thing only these military guys the ones that save the dinosaurs they still have to make you hate them and make them the villains that they show them just cattle prodding dinosaurs for no reason and actually ripping teeth out of dinosaurs just to collect them oh it's like look you have to hate these guys there's no reason for them to do what they're doing but you just have to hate these guys and don't worry they meet their justice about an hour and half in the movie after there's been no gore whatsoever there's a house of rich wealthy people and the dinosaurs get loose and all of a sudden arms go fly people are ripped in half it is just like so shockingly stupid but what is somehow worse than the flat villains are the flat heroes that it creates and since the villains can only be these white guys you know that everyone else is gonna be totally fine nothing Bad's gonna happen to them and then we showing the best possible light for no reason for example when you see a nine-year-old child walking through the mansion you know she's gonna save the day in some way and she does no better example of this is that the end of the movie after it's already been established that no woman's gonna be saving this movie Claire gets hurt so it's just Chris to save the date I'm like there's no way they're gonna let this happen are they sure enough he's on the roof with the Raptor with the gun pouring down rain on a glass ceiling sure enough his gun doesn't work so who comes to rescue Claire with her leg magically fixed standing dead stories up in the rain bang a machine because everyone has to be equally strong and capable okay another hero this movie is Franklin Webb a beta biracial male who is called into action his character isn't absolute coward but don't you worry when one of the strong light military guys asked him to hurry up and opening a door he turns around to finally quips at this military guy boy wait wasn't his character afraid of bugs thirty seconds ago yeah but that doesn't matter needs to talk down with this guy and then there's the CEO Rodriguez character brought into Jurassic world because she's a dinosaur veterinarian has she's seen a dinosaur no has she worked on a dinosaur no isn't she 25 and it takes eight years to be a veterinarian yes but forget that and weren't there dozens of veterinarians in the park originally one was open three years ago yeah there were so wait wait why are they taking this girl the island okay fine she's a biracial lesbian feminist okay bring her along that's really not the biggest problem it's really what happens in the scene how they force characters to do things that make no sense literally during a dangerous mission she walks up in demands that she goes on this journey with these military guys keep in mind these guys have been on the island for weeks killed multiple dancers and captured many - and she having zero experience in the island zero experience with Dinosaurs stalks down these guys and demands she goes and of course they just let her then after Chris Pratt is betrayed and he's shot and he's military guys surround her she just holds up a gun and defiantly stalks them down for literally no reason when they could just kill her right there and this happens over and over again where these guys literally had the green light to kill her but she just quips and talked down to them constantly that at one point he finally turns around shuts her in the door looks in the cameron says man she's a nasty woman quoting ashley jutted the women's March and not only do these moments and stupid lines take you out of the fantasy and thrust you into eight angry left his facebook thread but the reason why it really doesn't work it's like wait why didn't they just say no why didn't they just shoot them why don't they just hit him in the face which means these characters can do no wrong and there's no stakes or responsibilities whatsoever and that's really what the problem is unlike the Steven Spielberg classic in 1993 every good character is safe and perfect but in the original no one is safe and that keeps you at the edge of your seat because every is fair game in these new progressive movies there's only one type of person who is ever at risk and they didn't do this to make the movie better they didn't take the elements that you loved from the Steven Spielberg classic Jurassic Park but rather they wanted to force and trap you as the audience in their world social justice Park I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel up and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive
