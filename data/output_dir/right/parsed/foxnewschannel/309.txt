BRIAN: BRIDGE TOLLS SUSPENDED.
PEOPLE ARE RACING TO GET OUT OF
TOWN.
JANICE DEAN IS FOLLOWING
MICHAEL'S TRACK.
EVERYONE IN TALLAHASSEE,
HIGHWAYS WERE PACKED YESTERDAY.
>> UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT OF LEAD-UP TIME.
NOW IS THE TIME TO PAY CRUCIAL
ATTENTION TO THE LOCAL FORECASTS
AND OFFICIALS.
WE'LL SEE LANDFALL OF THIS
HURRICANE, PROBABLY A MAJOR
HURRICANE TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
LOOKING MORE LIKE TOMORROW
EVENING.
THE EXACT TIMING STILL TO BE
DETERMINED.
WE'RE EXPECTING A STRENGTHENING
STORM AS IT MAKES LANDFALL.
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STORM
BRINGS THE WORST OF THE STORM
SURGE, WORST OF WINDS, WORST OF
THE RAIN.
THAT ISN'T SAYING WEST SIDE OF
THE STORM WILL NOT FEEL EFFECTS.
WE HAVE INLAND PARTS AS FAR AS
NORTH AS SOUTH CAROLINA.
HERE IS THE LATEST TRACK, MAKING
LANDFALL WE THINK SOMETIME IN
THE AFTERNOON TOWARDS THE
EVENING HOURS, PANHANDLE OF
FLORIDA.
UP TOWARDS GEORGIA AND THE
CAROLINAS, STILL AS TROPICAL
STORM.
AREAS INUNDATED BY RAINFALL WITH
FLORENCE WILL GET MORE RAINFALL.
THE REASON WE THINK IT WILL
STRENGTHEN THE WATER AHEAD OF IT
IS LIKE A HOT TUB.
A LOT OF WARM WATER AHEAD OF IT.
NOTHING REALLY TO TEAR IT APART.
IT WILL REMAIN INTACT AND
STRENGTHEN.
A MAJOR HURRICANE NOT HIT THIS
AREA OF FLORIDA OVER A DECADE.
IT WAS 2005.
FOLKS, YOU NEED TO TAKE ALL
PRECALLINGS.
THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
