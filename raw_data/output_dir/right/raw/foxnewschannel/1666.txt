1
00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:01,966
AstraZeneca
may be able to help.

2
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:13,677
>> FOR DECADES, AMERICANS HAVE

3
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:15,613
BEEN GETTING FATTER AND FATTER.

4
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,381
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN IS THE

5
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:17,748
QUESTION.

6
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:18,983
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TRYING

7
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:21,152
TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH FOR A LONG

8
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:21,552
TIME.

9
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,487
THEY ISSUE DIETARY GOOD NIGHT

10
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:23,788
LINES.

11
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:25,990
IF YOU FOLLOW THEM, YOU GET THIN

12
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,993
AND HEALTHY, RIGHT?

13
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:31,562
ONE LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE GUIDE

14
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:36,734
LINES HAS CONCLUDED THAT THEY

15
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:39,370
MADE THINGS WORSE BECAUSE THEY

16
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:39,837
WERE WRONG.

17
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:43,440
AND SANYA, THANKS FOR COMING ON.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,608
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

19
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:46,544
>> THIS SEEMS LIKE A STORY THAT

20
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,879
EVERYONE WOULD BE -- IT'S LIKE A

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,282
SCANDAL, A BIG SCANDAL.

22
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:54,318
GOVERNMENT DIETARY GUIDELINES

23
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:57,054
HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF WHAT

24
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:58,622
THEY SAID THEY WOULD.

25
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:00,391
IF TRUE, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

26
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:01,992
>> A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT WHICH

27
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,762
IS WHY YOU DON'T HEAR MORE ABOUT

28
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:05,029
IT.

29
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:08,032
THE REALITY IS, OBESITY IN

30
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:10,267
AMERICA CONTINUES AT A LOW RATE

31
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:11,769
UNTIL 1980.

32
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:13,838
THEN IT TURNED SHARPLY UPWARDS.

33
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:14,972
WHAT HAPPENED IN 1980?

34
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:17,641
IN 1980 IS WHEN THE U.S.

35
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:21,378
GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED THE DIETARY

36
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:22,847
GUIDELINES FOR ALL AMERICANS.

37
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,048
THEY TOLD EVERYBODY IN AMERICA

38
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:26,450
TO EAT OVER 50% OF THEIR

39
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,886
CALORIES MAINLY AS GRAINS.

40
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:29,787
RIGHT?

41
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:31,889
GRAINS FATTENED CATTLE.

42
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:34,792
TURNS OUT THAT EATING 7 TO 11

43
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:37,528
SERVINGS OF BREAD EVERY DAY HAS

44
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:40,264
PROVEN TO BE FATTENING TO

45
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:40,631
AMERICANS.

46
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:41,298
>> YEAH.

47
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:43,100
DELICIOUS THOUGH.

48
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,035
>> WE HAVE THIS FOLLY FOR 40

49
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:45,936
YEARS NOW.

50
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:47,504
AND THE CONVENTIONAL ARGUMENT

51
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:50,374
FOR WHY WE'RE FAT AND DIABETIC

52
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:53,444
AS A NATION NOW IS WE DON'T

53
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:54,778
FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES.

54
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:59,083
IT'S THE FAULT OF AMERICANS FOR

55
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,885
FAILING TO FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES

56
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:02,553
AND NOT DOING ENOUGH EXERCISE.

57
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:05,389
WE LOOK AT THE BEST GOVERNMENT

58
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:05,689
DATA.

59
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:07,091
WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT AMERICANS

60
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:10,461
HAVE REALLY FAITHFULLY FOLLOWED

61
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:13,430
THE GUIDELINES IN EVERY

62
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,164
CATEGORY.

63
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:18,068
RED MEAT IS DOWN 28%.

64
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:21,538
ANIMAL FATS DOWN 20%.

65
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:22,873
WHOLE MILK DOWN 79%.

66
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,575
WE HAVE INCREASED EVERYTHING

67
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:25,910
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO INCREASE.

68
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,880
WE EAT 25% MORE VEGETABLES, 35%

69
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,048
MORE FRUIT.

70
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:33,617
28% MORE GRAINS.

71
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,753
87% MORE POLY UNSATURATED

72
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:37,955
VEGETABLE OILS AS WE'VE BEEN

73
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:38,255
TOLD.

74
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:42,726
ON EXERCISE SIDE, MORE THAN 54%

75
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:45,663
OF AMERICANS MEET THE FOOD

76
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:49,333
GUIDELINES, WHICH IS UP 44% IN

77
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:49,633
2005.

78
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:52,169
SO IN FACT, AMERICANS ARE DOING

79
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:53,871
A REALLY GOOD JOB.

80
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:56,840
THEY'RE EXERCISES MORE --

81
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,976
>> FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS.

82
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,912
BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRONG.

83
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:02,246
AMAZING.

84
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,280
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,382
IT'S JUST LIKE -- UNFORTUNATELY

86
00:03:05,382 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE OUT OF TIME BUT YOU
