Maxine Waters had to cancel a bunch of events because she was threatened she released a statement she said as the president has continued to lie and falsely claim that I encourage people to assault his supporters while also offering a veiled threat that I should be careful even more individuals are leaving threatening messages and sending hostile mail to my office she hasn't canceled two events one in Texas when in Alabama and she's received threats of shooting lynching and serious bodily harm I mean she's a she's a sitting congresswoman like yeah people are threatening to kill her to lynch her it's it's one of the most horrifying I mean has this happened before well I think we should I mean obviously he's responsible for for what he said about Maxine Waters he knows exactly what he's saying there's a reason he obsesses over her it's not especially not a random congresswoman there's something about her for some reason that he focuses on she had previously I apologize if you were to get to this she had previously received death threats that resulted in charges of San Pedro man back in the end of last year maybe he didn't know about that maybe he did maybe he doesn't care either way but in terms of this this violent the violent rhetoric just don't be coy I mean he is you know look they picked immigration for a reason they locked they separated those kids for a reason they see polls they saw you know things got a little close last month now Democrats back up six seven points they see where he's headed and they thought I we need our base fired up they picked immigration and now he's going out there and mentioning that oh please please keep Maxine Waters who he threatened lied about first turned into someone who had suggested she'd had violent rhetoric leading to a story I know we'll get to to Sean Hannity actually blaming her for the attack at at the Capitol Gazette and and now he says that the focus of the Democratic Party is Maxine Waters right interesting that he would choose or in Nancy Pelosi I mean it reflects what is you know I I think it's blatant it's it's not subtle it is misogyny and racism and they dovetail perfectly with Maxine Waters and I just want to briefly mention in terms of the double standard for their interpretation of rhetoric and what counts as violent so she said to call out government officials and that has been pitched every single day by Sean Hannity and by all the others as an explicit call to violence yesterday Shaun King and I got into a beef with dana loesch of the nra on twitter when he's Sean King found a video of her saying that she loves to see journalists get curb-stomped and they're the rat bastards of America and she said that's being taken out of context that we weren't doing the video was out of context then I respond people know yeah so I responded with the literal words of her tweet and she has yet to respond after previously responding several times weird that she ran away at that point but think about that that saying you want them to be curb stomped a particular call in popular culture where do you know curb stomping from American history there's mr. X that is the only place most people know if that's not a random thing that she chose there she knows the racial connotations there she chooses to use it and again that is not the only time that she herself has threatened journalists with videos saying their time is up we're coming for you and all of that and so when it comes to both these the politicians and the media there's the violent rhetoric inevitably violence flows we can't necessarily connect the two but we do see the connection and we know how the right covers for them after the fact there's no soul-searching there's no dana loesch saying you know I've really chose my words poorly I won't do that in the future Trump isn't saying I won't call them the enemy of the people in the future none of that is going on which means that while they may not want to be held responsible for the actions that have already taken place they are condoning future actions I think when you say you want people to be curb-stomped some journalists who are the worst basically there was a paraphrasing bastards bastards for the earth that counts as the worst you rat bastards would be pretty low so so her Twitter handle is that making this what you will nationally syndicated host best-selling author Second Amendment advocate born for the storm like I don't know I don't use the phrase storm I find it interesting would she be at the front of the storm seems like she might be that the storm front the front of the storm would be what she might be a brief piece of trivia sure t1t trivia I apologize so you can't see it but you're on our Twitter page and her header photo what is it it's a protest sign right yes yeah that says what it says hello she hates ice-cream yeah do you know who's holding up that sign no Ricky strum is that right I swear to God anyway I apologize for derailing the conversation but Dana Loesch has a you can't see him there but it's his sign from Africa the reason why I don't believe that is because I don't think Ricky would spell her name correctly so Ricky is the host of TYT sports which you should check out either on our app toi t.com slash app or on youtube.com slash TYT sports anyway so now I'm back to Donald Trump keeping us safe I thought the Muslim ban was gonna keep us safe but yet there's Massacre after Massacre I thought that his getting tough on the border and which he you know reference oh I'm gonna go after the immigrants the immigrants are causing the problems remember the last time an immigrant cross the border and then massacred people yeah alright I don't I don't can't kind of tell you that that I found amazing you might apologize if you said on the show yesterday in that shooting at the Gazette a white man killed more people in that act then all of the Americans who've been killed by people crossing over from the countries on the Muslim ban list of the time yeah and that's I don't mean yesterday I mean for all time and that's not to say that there's something wrong with white people I don't know if you can tell John is white okay he just I've tried right so what right now what it does say okay because you know the right-wing are snowflakes and so the minute you even say the word no we're pointing at your stupidity that you say all the Muslims do do real problems is it the Moslems though it doesn't look like it's the Muslims one white guy allowed and killed more than everyone on the Muslim ban list anybody who would ever come from any of those countries combined we're not saying it's white people's fault we're just asking you not to be stupid and say it's Muslim people's fault or Latinos fault that's demagoguery yes that's racism and bigotry when in reality we don't have an ethnic problem in this country we have a gun problem in this country two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
