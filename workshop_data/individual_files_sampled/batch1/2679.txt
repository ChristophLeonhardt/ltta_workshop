there are techniques for ear wax that have existed for many many years perhaps even centuries before doctors had the equipment and tools to take it out so a candling technique is using a heat and a vacuum to extract the wax it has worked for you and hasn't caused harm I sure people are successfully doing it but I have seen situations where folks have heated up the wax and then it melted and went in onto their eardrum and I had someone call up emergently they thought they went deaf because the wax went all the way onto their ears are when they couldn't hear and then they had to come in and I had to abstraction for them so not sure how successful it is out there
