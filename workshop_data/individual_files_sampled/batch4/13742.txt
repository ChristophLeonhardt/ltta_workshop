wife wasn't that thrilled bevin going the superbowl button retrospective but she in the end in the end she was happy that I went ahead a good time I brought my father I went with my business partner Jeremy we went with with the president of the company Caleb and all thanks to Westwood ones who want to thank our partners over Westwood one for giving us the seats because it was pretty incredible so we were seated up behind the behind the Patriots endzone and the stadium first of all in Minnesota is amazing it's an amazing Stadium it's just beautiful I'm sure all those public to those public dollars were put to good use when no one ever travels there it is it is incredible like it's not a place you want to hang out okay like in the summer many in Minnesota is beautiful it's a beautiful state my family's vacation in Minnesota during the summer during the winter it is a hellscape I mean we were there yesterday and it was it was 15 degrees below zero with the windchill and needless to say I was not prepared for this so that's why I'm missing an ear at this point and at least two toes lost to frostbite but there there are a few things that really struck me about the Super Bowl this year aside from the fact it was a phenomenal game and no one knows how to tackle so those were those were the two big ones great game no one plays defense and it's not on Tom Brady guys like you know I'm not the biggest brady fan although he is the best quarterback of all time clearly still when you throw three touchdowns no interceptions and throw for 508 yards and lose that's your defense is false like that's not your fault so everybody said I'm Brady about this is ridiculous but the thing that really struck me and what was pretty cool about it is you get in the stadium it's a bunch of people who hate the other team right and the Eagles fans hate the Patriots and the Patriots fans hate the Eagles and they have a long record of not liking each other very much and yet in the stadium there was a real feeling of camaraderie among everybody who is actually there maybe it's because it's really cold outside no one wanted to leave maybe it's because just being part of an amazing event like that feels really cool I mean this is communal experience and we're all taking part and there was some there was a feeling of camaraderie among the folks in the stadium regardless of which side you actually preferred to win which side you were rooting for to the point where after the game maybe it should because the Patriots have won every other Super Bowl for a decade but the Patriots fans were very gracious to the Eagles fans and the Eagles fans were I think relatively gracious to the Patriots fans and everybody got along and it was it was just a wonderful than the electricity in the stadium was incredible I mean everyone was basically standing for the entire time I will say what was one of the funny things is that one of the things people pay attention to at home because I've watched every other Super Bowl from from home is you pay attention to the halftime show in the stadium no one cares in the stadium the level of attention paid to the Super Bowl halftime show is relatively no right this one all the bathrooms fill up and you leave to go out and get a coke for $1,000 and and you can't hear anything because the stadium is set up in such a way but the the actual atmosphere it was really cool and what was super cool is that and shows you what the NFL did wrong the season how they really blew it this season one of the things the NFL really did wrong the season was the they really handled the national anthem kneeling thing poorly and the way that you could tell that is because the biggest rounds of applause happen for the national anthem and for there's a tribute to Medal of Honor winners it was patriotism and country and people felt good about the country it felt good you feel good about the country being in there because like this is such an amazing place it's the most prosperous rich free country on the face of the earth filled with all these celebrities who are going to these stadiums you can get on the plane and fly in the middle of nowhere and have a game where you bring 67,000 people into the stadium and you can just do it right you can do that I mean it's an amazing amazing thing anyway I want to show you some of the best moments I thought so first of all then point out that the people who actually won my nick foles who's a backup quarterback right and he played the game of his life but an incredible game when's the new Super Bowl MVP and then probably will not be on the Eagles the year after next as soon as Carson Wentz is available again he had said a couple of days beforehand that he's a religious Christian he says when he retires he wants to be a pastor I thought that's just wonderful here was Nick Foles talking about it everything that's first and foremost that's everything I wouldn't be able to do this game without him I don't have the strength to go out here and do this this is supernatural but it's also you know opportunity to go out there and you know share what he's done in my life and it's not about prospering at all it's about how he's humbled me in my weaknesses he made me strong second Corinthians 12:9 you know whenever I was at my lowest that's why you know my relationship with Christ grew I mean there's an amazing great religious statement and something that's always true for for Americans at large now you don't have to be a religious person to appreciate this guy's fervor and the fact he saw God as strengthening at him in his darkest moments that's true for the vast majority of people on planet Earth for most of history it wasn't just him Doug Peterson is the coach of the Eagles amazing play calling yesterday I mean there are a couple of really gutsy play calls there's a play call where they went for it on fourth down I think was fourth and five and that's when he called the the reverse to Foles as a receiver which is amazing here's Doug Peterson thanking Jesus at the at the award ceremony afterward how do you explain this that nine years ago you're coaching in a high school and here you are with this trophy I can only give the praise to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for giving me this opportunity yes I mean that there a lot of people paying attention that so there are a few people who made who made clear that you know at the beginning of the season it was all about kneeling for the anthem and now is all about praying I mean at the very end of the at the end of the game all the Eagles got together and they actually formed a circle and they parade with foals which is pretty amazing and that wasn't by any stretch of the imagination the only sort of patriotic and religious point to the evening during the national anthem all the players were standing it was electric I mean during the national anthem people knew that it was infused with additional meaning because of all the folks had been kneeling and and people were supremely enthusiastic painted a very good rendition of the national anthem as well and good for all the players for standing you know this is an amazing country you get to be rich and play football for a living and not have to fight for scraps I mean it's an amazing amazing country it's an amazing event and the level of care that goes into each and everything like for example during the halftime show and see all those lights waving in the stands out a bunch of people who are spontaneously taking out their cell phones their actual wristbands that have lights that are coordinated to go off at certain times it's really impressive then I think the biggest round of applause of the night was not even for any of that the biggest round of applause for the night was the Medal of Honor winner so that right before the game they could pay tribute to Medal of Honor winners JJ Watt tweeted this out about the Medal of Honor winners these were all the Medal of Honor winners who joined on the field together one of them actually flipped the the opening flip of the coin and it was an amazing moment I mean the entire stadium just erupted it was really terrific there's another moment later where they paid tribute to the Air Force and the stadium erupted again one of the things that that football needs to understand and one things the NFL needs to understand is that the popularity of the sport is deeply entwined with a good feeling about the country if you feel bad about the country it's hard to enjoy sports because you feel like sports are frivolous if you feel good about the country then sports are a distraction from the mundane sure but they're also a reminder that all of our conflict is really play acted and that's not true in politics you know in politics there's a lot of our conflict that's not it's real it's about issues that matter and and I care deeply about but it's good for Americans to recognize every once in a while things with the Super Bowl is for it's good for us to recognize every once in a while that there are these these moments where we have more in common than we are separated by so it's amazing that an evening that's really about you know conflict between two teams is really more about the love for fans for one another it's really more about the love of country it was really more about what we are unified in favor of and that's why it was so entwined with the flag and entwined with the military and it's why alienated so many fans when the players started kneeling because like why are you slapping one of the things that makes football great in the face why are you doing that well sure this isn't a sport that's that's global this is an American sport and it's deeply been been intertwined again with American patriotism for a very long time so in just a second I'm gonna show you how things went down in Philadelphia afterward because I talked about the power of a community coming together for something good and now I'm gonna show you what happens when things don't go so great and that's what happened in Philadelphia but first notice a thank you to our Unser's

they like each other that they're that there's something to the community feeling then great things can happen there's a study that Arthur Brooks over an American Enterprise Institute likes to cite that's really an interesting study talking about the value of getting together in crowds the value of meeting people on an individual level so in 1934 there was sociologist who did a study where he took a Chinese couple all around the United States they went something like 250 restaurants all United around the United States 250 200 hotels and they would walk in the restaurant they'd all be served they'd all be given a room and then the sociologist remembers in 1934 calls up all the restaurants and all the hotels and he asks the restaurants in the hotels would you serve a Chinese couple and all but one said no we would not well what that means that people are actually better than you think they are in a vacuum they're not worse we tend to think that people are worse than we think they're only them but that's really true usually most of the people who you hate when you meet them they turned out not to be so bad and it's why it's important to have these sort of communal events one of the things that's happened in our culture is we have fewer and fewer of these communal events the Super Bowl is a communal event because a water-cooler event but most of us get our entertainment choices now through Netflix or Hulu they we cut the cord I've cut the cord twice actually because I got I got a cable back and then I went back to cutting the cord because it was a waste of money and that's great I mean I love on-demand TV I'm not willing to give it up but it does mean that you need to engage with the community otherwise you end up not engaging with anyone and a polarized atomized Society is one where people dislike each other more now all of that said I've been talking about sort of the power of community and communal experiences communal events a feeling of communal purpose which I talk about in the book that I'm writing right now but when communities go wrong then things can get kind of nasty so some of the highlights from Philadelphia were not particularly great some of them are great so this is this one was terrific there are a couple of music students who opened up their their window on the fifth floor of a building and started playing the fly Eagles fly fight song while everybody downstairs was singing is pretty cool right there look at this from a fifth floor window at the University of the Arts the Miriam Theatre don't get any better than that that's pretty awesome that was the good then there was the bad summons you decided that it would be worthwhile for him to legitimately eat horse crap I don't know why this would occur to you why this would be a thing like unless it was a bet and even then why would you bet on this you can get diseases from this but um no this is not good this is not a good thing see this guy eat the horse tongue aah oh no aah no okay when when when crowds are there there can either be good things where there can be bad things the crowd can either be United sort of communal purpose or it can be united for urging a moron to eat horse crap off the ground and there's a little bit too much of that in Philadelphia last night New England Patriots fans can can rest assured that although the New England Patriots did not emerge victorious the city of Philadelphia apparently smoking wreckage just ridiculous now that wasn't the only bad thing that happened in Philadelphia I don't pretend like everything that happened was bad but the police were basically saying is getting out of control last night here's a little montage of people destroying convenience stores smashing Macy's windows collapsing and awning just joy happening over there so okay so these people who are on top of the of the Ritz Hotel awning and they were doing trust falls off the awning into the crowd because they're stupid and then too many of them got on top and then the entire awning collapsed so geniuses at work so this is the problem of crowds right if you don't have a purpose for the crowd if the crowd is just there then the crowd may turn to the most nefarious purpose it's one of the things that we need to recognize about why religious institutions in social fabric are necessary I'm not saying Philadelphia doesn't have any of those things of course they do I'm saying the crowd last night you know the ones that were they were breaking into looting stores that was not their communal purpose it was not to go to church a crowd that is undirected can go bad very very quickly a crowd that is directed shears for Medal of Honor winners and I don't think the people who make up the crowd are necessarily all that different I think that it's all about what's in their minds and what's in their heads and what they're there to do and if you're there to celebrate America and you're there to celebrate the fact that we can have these these amazing spectacles and we can afford to go to games like this and we can afford to fly in then you'll get a different crowd than the one that that wants to break into the convenience store because things are now apparently free it also shows how dumb the Democrats are by the way all of this shows how dumb the Democrats are to embrace the destruction of the NFL which is then the national anthem kneeling thing so Nancy Pelosi yesterday felt the necessity to equate Colin Kaepernick to Rosa Parks which is just an insane comparison Rosa Parks obviously the victim of segregation Colin Kaepernick is the victim of receiving several tens of millions of dollars worth of money in both advertising and in and in and in salary nancy pelosi tweeted out yesterday on the day of the Superbowl Rosa Park proved that sometimes the best way to stand up is to sit down and that was supposed to be a slap at Trump because Trump had said that we all stand for the national anthem if this is the way Democrats want to go they shouldn't be surprised when those of us who like the social fabric or bell at this we need our symbols we need our unifying moments and when you don't give us our symbols when you don't give us our unifying moments the country tears apart because maybe the only thing holding us together at this point are the symbols maybe the only thing holding us together is a vague web of country that has not been boiled down to specific philosophical principles if so that's a problem we need to fill in those gaps but if Democrats take away even the symbols there's not gonna be a lot left on the surface of the social fabric once they once the route has been eaten away so that's a serious problem meanwhile speaking with people who are eating away the root of the social fabric late night over the weekend really outdid itself so Jimmy Kimmel has been the pace setter he's the new pope of the left according to guy Benson a good label I think and Jimmy Kimmel apparently appeared at a he apparently appeared at some event for pod save America so last week remember I criticized Stephen Colbert for having on pod save America after the State of the Union because Stephen Colbert would never have me on after a State of the Union by a Democrat or a Republican we have about the same sized audience Jimmy Kimmel obviously had to outdo his compatriot in the in leftist terms because he is the new pope and so he actually said at this event quote it just so happens that almost every talk show host is a liberal and that's because it requires a level of intelligence so according to Jimmy Kimmel the reason that he and his fellow talk-show hosts are on the left is because they're smart you see it's not because they have a certain point of view and they all live in a bubble and they've all lived in big cities most of their lives it's not because they spend all of their time hanging out with other people on the left and never have a dissenting conversation it's not any of that stuff it's just because they're so smart you see right because Jimmy Kimmel like on a pure IQ test I'm sure Jimmy Kimmel a guy who had women feel his crotch on national TV would outdo me I think for example I think when a talk comes talk show hosts put Jimmy Kimmel next to Dennis Miller I'm sure the Jimmy Kimmel wildly out does Dennis Miller a conservative and there are people bunch of people saying well isn't he right aren't all the talk-show hosts on the left well no the most successful talk show host of the last 35 years was Jay Leno and Jay Leno is center-right Jay Leno is a gentleman was libertarian so no this is this is stupidity all the web and it's so smug and it's so smarmy and then you wonder why the culture is being torn apart like Jimmy Fallon showed up at the Super Bowl and one of the things that happen I'm not sure if they showed it on TV they showed its game there's a shot of him and he kind of made a joke where he spilled water all over himself and it was charming and it was funny and then after the game Jimmy Kimmel has to join in the race to the political bottom like whatever you think of Trump you don't have to like Trump but turning this into everything has to be a partisan fight turning our late-night show hosts into partisan fighters who can't make a joke about Barack Obama for eight and then can't stop making jokes about Trump but not even jokes just nasty riffs how does that unify the country in any serious way serious criticisms of Trump I'm perfectly willing to hear although not from the Lexington me Kimmel who does not know what he's talking about virtually any issue we've debunked him a thousand times on the show at this point but having our late-night show hosts devolve into take take the places of common culture take the places of common space and to vote those to polarization it's a huge mistake I think it's really bad for the culture Jimmy Fallon is trying to outdo Kim oh because Fallon was beating Kimmel during the election cycle Kimmel's been beating found lately so after the show Fallon put on his glasses and his wig painted his Bob Dylan routine before you shout out that they should be man listen to what they are saying we pour the facts and Brandi's ship and his head off his attacks the past what he says you know so now he's defending the people who are kneeling for the end them again that's a social place where we don't need the social fabric ripped and Jimmy Fallon is is Louden that he's saying that that's that's just a wonderful thing and then he also crooned come women and men who has tagged me to and believe me when I say that we believe you four week is the man who calls truth fake news times up our silence were breaking okay Jimmy well I mean let's hear it who in Hollywood's been harassing women I'm sure you know a few you can name some names then come on come on you hang out with all these people I'm sure you know at least a couple of guys who are into grabbing women by the behind and then another verse he said quote come journalists writers who report the facts first of all Bob Dylan is so frickin overrated right it's like a cat being run over by a lawn mower Bob Dylan anyway he says come journalists writers who report the facts and brandish your pens a fend off his attacks but past what he says and look at how he acts the fire and fury is raging for his words can hurt but your words can fight back New York Times they aren't a falen it just come on again taking that common space reducing it to partisan bickering not smart I didn't like him when Trump did about the NFL by the way you remember I said I agreed with Trump I still didn't like it when Trump did it with that with regard to the NFL I thought that it was needlessly polarizing I don't like it when the left does it either we need these common spaces if we do not have these common spaces where it can come together I promise you have everyone who's surrounding me out there are a few fans we took some pictures nice but they're promised you the vast majority people who were there we're from New England which is a left area or from Philadelphia which is a left area in Minnesota which tends to be a left area and most of those people disagree with me we all got along famously because we understand there's still a common route that we all hold that we hold to okay so in just a second I'm gonna get two memo talk memo fights one t18 the return the revenge the grandpa and it's not the grand finale unfortunately there's so much more memo

he has new memos that are coming Democrats want to release their own memo we're just gonna have memos up the wazoo Finding Nemo it's gonna be just it'll just be entrancing I am super excited about it but I finally had a chance of last Friday as you recall the memo the text of the memo was actually released in the middle of the show until we read through it on the air and you saw it my thinking evolved in real-time now I've had some actual time to gather my thoughts on the Devon Nunez memo is it a nothing burger no it's not a complete nothing burger is it the end of the world the end of all things Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome it is not okay it is not here is the most specific thing that it does it accuses the FBI of applying for a warrant on Carter page it was then a post he was done being a trump foreign policy advisor it applied for a warrant on Carter page and the FISA application was apparently based on steel dossier which was a Democrat Apple research document and the noonas memo says that the FBI lied about that to the FISA Court and didn't inform them that this was in fact funded by the Democrats and was a piece of opposition hit research and supposedly they did this in an attempt to get Trump now it's the end that statement that I have a problem with that they did this in an attempt to get Trump because it is possible that they thought that they were actually investigating real Russian collusion even if nothing materializes investigations happen all the time it is also possible that Kyra page is dirty and they're investigating him he's been dirty or at least he's been suspected of being dirty since 2013 there was a FISA warrant on him in 2014 it is also possible they got overzealous with the warrant so there are a bunch of assumptions that have to be made in order to get to the worst possible conclusion so the worst possible conclusion is that in the waning days of the election the FBI was trying to sink the Trump campaign by ordering a FISA warrant which never was released by the way never leaked never was released before the election says a weird argument that they were trying to take down Trump from the inside a deep state was trying to take down Trump from the inside by going after Carter page with a with a trumped-up FISA warrant based on the steel dossier that's that's essentially the accusation now it's very possible that it's true that the FISA application on page was fatally flawed and driven by prosecutorial aggression but in order to get to this really deep conspiracy theory where it was a bunch of people in the FBI trying to take down Trump and trying to basically manipulate the fact into it's Trump Russia collusion you have to make a bunch of assumptions first you have to assume that there's no there they're not only that there's no Trump Russia collusion but that there was no reasonable suspicion of Trump Russia collusion yeah that's the first thing you have to assume I don't know that that assumption is actually true I think that in the middle of the campaign if you're an FBI agent you saw Donald Trump sending emails to members of the Russian governments are people who are close to the Russian government saying if you can turn over a bunch of information to me and help me from the Russian government I'm willing to hear it that might make you somewhat suspicious if George papadopolis a former Trump eight had already been lying to the FBI or was about to lie to the FBI is already under investigation at that point for apparently shoping intelligence that he'd gotten supposedly from a Russian source about Hillary Clinton then maybe there was grounds for suspicion even if the suspicion doesn't pan out this is like saying that every time the cops take out a search warrant that that's a problem even if they don't find anything well not every search warrant comes up with something right that's why you have to have a warrant probable cause doesn't mean certain cause it means probable cause so I you have to first assume that Carter page never should have been gone after in the first place you have to assume that so first you have to assume that the FBI had no reasonable grounds for any suspicions about this campaign second you have to assume the entire steal is pure garbage all parts of it remain unverified okay at the time they saw this deal dossier the FBI may or may not have thought that it is unclear that the FBI knew that it was garbage and went to the FISA Court with it anyway they need certain parts of it were garbage but even when James Comey testified that there were parts that were unverified and and salacious he said there were parts of it that were very unverified and salacious not the entire thing was unverified installations third you have to assume that the FBI's attempts to garner awards against Carter page were driven by anti-trump bias not serious suspicions about Paige that's hard because Paige again had been under suspicion for a long time he advised Gazprom the Russian official gas Authority in 2013 the Russians attempted to cultivate pages an intelligence source in that year and stated in intercepted communications that it was obviously wanted to earn loads of money there was no FISA warrant taken out against him in 2014 so Paige has been on the radar for a very long time so the idea that it's just beyond insane that they would be on nuts that they would target Carter page I don't see the evidence for that fourth you have to assume that all of this wasn't just bureaucratic incompetence it wasn't just people got overzealous because they wanted Carter page or because they saw what they suspected was Trump Russia collusion the auto results of the warrant it's gotta be they were attempting to get Trump to finish Trump that it was done that of pure animus for Trump not out of any real suspicion and finally we have to assume that the same supposedly bad actors inside the FBI and DOJ are now staffing the mauler investigation that Muller is infused with that same bias that he wants to get Trump because he hates Trump and therefore he's willing to look past all evidence now there's a problem with that which is that Peter struck and Lisa paged the two most anti Trump FBI agents from their text Peter struck was saying in 2017 he didn't see any there-there to the Trump Russia investigation so to suggest that he was desperately attempting to trump up some sort of information there the evidence there is really thin now this is not to say there wasn't corruption inside the FBI there was but it was with regard to Hillary Clinton as I've detailed in the last couple of weeks the corruption on the Hillary investigation is almost unquestioned the idea the Obama administration was basically giving soft orders to the rest of the FBI and the DOJ to let Hillary off the hook it's pretty obvious from the timeline Andy McCarthy has done a good job of breaking that down but I want to be very careful about what we allege here so we don't get beyond the facts if there are additional facts we can talk about them so for example there's a rumor going around today that there was a second Steele dossier and this Steele dossier was created when Hillary Clinton basically went to some foreign sources had them funnel information to the State Department the State Department then funneled those foreign sources to to steal now the question is whether steal then took those and went to the FBI that part of the story isn't clear yet then it would look like a pipeline was being set up but that pipeline already existed right I mean steel was working for Hillary Clinton working for fusion GPS that wouldn't really be a surprise the only thing that would make it worse is if it was funneled through the State Department and then to steal right then it looks like the State Department was being mobilized on behalf of Hillary that would be a real scandal and we'll see if that develops right there it's still a little early for that here's my point I'm willing to be I'm willing to change my mind based on the evidence but I need the evidence to actually be presented so so far I haven't seen the evidence yet because here's the final the here's what we finally know in some right we we know at least we suspect that the FBI and DOJ lied to the FISA Court about the grounds for a warrant on Carter page that's exactly what Nunez suggests we know that Steele didn't like Trump it is controversial as well that information was included in the FISA application it's not completely clear it's very clear that the Trump Russian investigation was not predicated on Carter page that was predicated on George papadopolis that was admitted by Nunez what that means is that there was more of the investigation than just Carter page which means that all the talk about firing Muller based on this is a little bit over the top there trey gowdy essentially said this he said a couple of things said number one the FISA warrants on page wouldn't happen without the seal dossier but he also said pretty clearly that this the the Trump Russian investigation is not just the Carter page war and so to end it based on just the Carter page warrant there's not enough evidence for that would it have been authorized were it not for that dossier no it would not have been and how can you say that because it was authorized four times by separate judges right and the information was in there all four times okay so you know the information was there all four times it's unclear whether by that point some of the information had been checked out and but but here's the thing that really bothers me about all this why reading the memo Trumpkin declassify this any time he can you classify the actual application anytime he wants so if you wants to declassify it and then we can all see the truth then we can see the truth I want more information at this point again I'm perfectly open to the idea that there is a quote-unquote deep State and then it's against Trump and I was the evidence of it I'm not going to on a conspiratorial bandwagon just because it feels good to do so I want to read into this and determine whether it's malice or whether it is corruption or whether it is incompetence I want to find out whether the FBI really acted in insane ways here or whether they were just sloppy and I want to know whether the corruption was about Hillary Clinton which we already know or whether it extended to we have to stop Trump because the evidence for that I think is a lot slimmer okay in just a second I'm going to

said about the memo is true in on base of evidence I will say Democratic resistance to the memo has been so extremely as to make it suggest that there is something to hide and that's one of the problems here is that the Democrats reacted to the noonas memo not by saying just put it out there it's a bunch of crap instead they decided it was important for them to go nuts over it so Adam Schiff was one of the people going nuts over it he also leaked his own memo probably to the press he said that this memo could result in an Oklahoma City Style bombing I mean this kind of language is not helpful if you're trying to look like you're not bothered by a memo in the future the intelligence community is going to be very wary about sharing information with us because they won't trust us to be responsible stewards of it and sources of information are going to dry up if you have a neighbor next door who's buying a lot of fertilizer and it seems odd to you because they don't have a yard are you gonna think twice before calling the FBI because if they get a search warrant for your neighbor and and something is politicized the political winds change and there's an investigation your identity is gonna be revealed because you really can't trust that this is gonna be kept confidential anymore okay this is this is asinine the idea that the intelligence community does not have a legal responsibility to share information with the Congress is insane again if Democrats want to say that is gonna lead to a bombing in Oklahoma City style bombing this memo come on come on in fact media we're pushing this line from weeks before the memo actually came out that's what makes everybody so skeptical there are two things that make Republicans skeptical and willing to buy into conspiracy theories one is the one is the feeling that the FBI was acting on behalf of Hillary Clinton which is actually true and two is the feeling that the Democrats and the media are desperate to keep the memo from reaching the light which makes everybody jump to ok well that must mean that everything in the memo and all the all these sort of allegations that are drawn from the memo must be true in their most extreme form again the memo itself does not call from all our to step down the memo doesn't make any connection to Moeller the memo doesn't call for rod Rosenstein to step down it doesn't matter people are jumping to those conclusions anyway President Trump himself comes out and attacks Adam Schiff for leaking he tweeted this out a little bit earlier today little Adam Schiff so he's right we need to find the president's and new adjectives because I think he's now been little for little Marco and like a thousand people are little Adam Schiff little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and clapper let's see Adam leaves clothes committee hearings to illegally leaked confidential information must be stopped must be stopped okay so I think that it's true that Adam Schiff is a leaker I don't know that this is worthwhile for the president to engage it seems to me the president has already cast enough shadow on this investigation that no matter what happens here his defenders will have something to hang on to engaging in this sort of fight is not useful it's also it'd be a good time for the president to go around and and talk up the economy a little bit there's been a drop in the Dow over the last couple of days that equates to over a thousand points where we basically erased all the gains made in the month of January in about three days so the market dropped 666 points on Friday it's down about 500 points at this point on today on Monday so that is not good stuff mr. president there's more important things to be doing meanwhile if you wanna let Devin noonas go out there and do his thing let him do his thing he called Devin Oona as a great American hero we'll find out Devin Nunez says there's more coming by the way he says there will be more bombshells that will be released memos that are going to come out are there other memos you said this was phase one yeah so this so this completes just the FISA abuse portion of our investigation we are we are in the middle of what I call phase two of our investigation which involves other departments specifically the State Department and some of the involvement that they had in this that investigation is ongoing and we continue to work towards finding answers and and asking the right questions to try to get to the bottom of what exactly the State Department was up to in terms of this rush investing so Nunez is obviously using byron York as his source for leaking information by New York over at the Washington Examiner is the guy who reported what I reported earlier that the State Department had received information via a Hillary compatriot about about I guess Carter page and the bet information was then funneled to Christopher Steele unclear what happened with that part of the dossier use of the State Department as Hilary's personal tool would be no shock whatsoever again the corruption in the State Department regard to Hillary Clinton is not a surprise the corruption in the FBI with regard to Hillary Clinton is not a surprise we should be very careful where we're tiptoeing in murky waters here let's wait for all the evidence to come out then we can make some serious calls about it okay time for some things I like and then we'll do some things I hate and then we will get to a federalist paper so things that I like so I was on the plane yesterday as well as today and yesterday I watched the oscar-nominated three billboards outside Epping Missouri originally the first half-hour this thing was headed directly for things I hate and for the first half hour I thought this is just an awful film not because the plot is uninteresting but just because it's one of those films that tries to straddle the borderline between serious and absurd with with touches of funny and I'm not a big fan of that kind of feel like you don't know whether to watch in comedy you don't know whether you're watching a tragedy the last half of the film gets much better the performances are universally quite good the best performance in the film is Woody Harrelson which is shocking makes I'm not a Woody Harrelson fan but Woody Harrelson plays the sheriff in this town basically the plot is this Woody Harrelson is a sheriff in a small town Frances McDorman plays the mother of a girl who was who was killed and raped and she thinks that the police department has not been doing enough to track down the killers because it's seven months later and they don't have a suspect and she puts up these three billboards outside of her outside of the town that say that the police department isn't doing enough to track down on the killer Sam Rockwell who was gonna win Best Supporting Actor plays a sort of racist nasty cop who in the end has sort of a transformation and I here's a little bit of preview so what you can and cannot say on a billboard I assume you can't say nothing defamatory and you can't say that right or Amos I think I'll be all right then that's right I'm Angela Hayes this manner so murdered Hayes why did you put up these billboards my daughter Angela was murdered seven months ago it seems to me the police department is too busy torturing black folks to solve actual crime diction I'm in the middle of my Easter dinner target I know Chief but I think we got kind of a problem son son baby not a good I'd do anything to catch your daughter's killer I don't think those billboards is very fair time it took you to get out here why none like will it be some other poor girls probably out there being butchered right now we've had two official complaints about those billboards from the story the story of the film is not tracking down the killer so this isn't a mystery story about who killed the girl of the woman's daughter the the real story is about what exactly Frances McDormand character is doing because she's so angry that she's taking out her anger in every direction the whole story is really about anger and the wages of anger and not thinking enough about the consequences of your actions because you're angry and and from that perspective I think that there's a lot about the film it's quite good it's a little bit too clever by half it has situations like that one right where people are just doing things about consequence that make no sense just in real life her friends has been terminus kicking teenagers in the crotch and nothing happens to her I mean like that come on there a couple other scenes where like this one they're about to show where she where she's throwing firebombs and things and nothing happens to her I you know I understand the whole thing is supposed to be a little bit surreal I guess that's the director style of the director writer style still it it begs the the because the mix is of stuff that is ultra realistic and stuff that is not realistic at all it's a little bit it's a little bit hard to tell what exactly the director is trying to do and some of the writing is really really on the nose there are a couple of scenes that are supremely on the nose but what do you hear all since performance is great there are a couple of great scenes in it is the best picture of the year no it's not the best picture of their come on okay come on and either is get out and either the shape of water the best picture of the year is clearly Dunkirk but I'm biased because I like that movies okay time for some time for some other things that are like so let's go to some of these Superbowl commercials so we can actually see the Superbowl commercials inside the Super Bowl that is the one drawback of watching the thing at the place I can live without the commercials so and really care that much but there are a couple of these Super Bowl ads some of them are funny and there's one that's getting all sorts of flak that I want to talk about briefly so first a couple of funny ones so there's an ad for the NFL I guess with Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr and the from dirty dancing is pretty funny girl work on that thing yeah let's do it no still practicing touchdown celebrations it goes on like this for a full minute all right so it's so that's funny stuff another one of the ads that I thought was funny the tie dad was pretty good so this is a David Harbor from from stranger things doing and doing an ad for tide that looks nothing like an advert I'd just a typical Super Bowl car but it's a tie dad what it's a tie dad well there are no stains look at those clean clothes what else would this be an ad for diamonds a gift that lasts for an extreme tide meet the all-new it's a tie dad tied it so does this make every Super Bowl ad tie that okay and so that's a very very smart ad okay it's pretty great so well done tied I will say the only thing that can actually fix eating horse bleep is apparently a tied pod so all the people who ate horse bleep yesterday I'm not recommending you to type I because I could come with criminal culpability but if you do I'll just say I don't think the world would be would be lessened by your absence okay other other ads that are funny okay so I can't actually batch for this one did you actually see the Amazon ad was it any good and so the this is the so the here's the Amazon ad we'll watch it together in real time and see whether it was any good in Austin it's 60 degrees was it cheap lexan Amazon's Alexa lost her voice this morning causing like she lost her voice how is that even possible we have the replacements ready you just say the word and you're sure this is gonna work yeah let's go show me a recipe for a grilled cheese sandwich betting you're 32 years of age and you don't know how to make a grilled cheese sandwich its name is the recipe how far is Mars well how am I supposed to know I'd have a visit this guy want to go to Mars not even ought to dude there let's go set the mood now setting the mood you're in the bush and you're just so dirty and it's so sweaty cuz it's hot in that bush like three bush refree boot actually play some country music no no country music I'm afraid Brandon is a little tied up but do let me know if there's anything I can help you with okay okay that's funny commercial okay okay funny commercial okay here's the one that got it on all the criticism so dodge ram didn't add when they featured Martin Luther King Jr's voice and and this drew all sorts of criticism for reasons that I find kind of stupid here's the ad it's a dr. Martin Luther King jr. speaking from February 4th 1968 50 years ago and here's what he had to say if you want to be important wonderful if you want to be recognized wonderful but recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be your servant that's a new definition of greatness position of greatness it means everybody can be great okay so this ad got all sorts of crap because it was juxtaposing you know people serving and and though and the words of Martin Luther King with the Dodge Ram so people with oh my god how could they use the Martin Luther King to sell dodge Rams okay number one I don't really think that that's what the ad is about okay I remember that there was a I think was GM didn't add with Clint Eastwood a few years ago at the Superbowl and the ad was all him talking about how great the country was and nobody felt like oh my god how could they possibly you know use patriotism to sell product I didn't see any of the critics of this ad actually noting something the messages that are being promoted by the ad are good I can put aside the fact you don't like commercialism put aside the fact you may not like capitalism all that much the ad is spending millions of dollars to promote an ethos of service to others right that's an amazing thing right they spend probably fifteen million dollars on this ad to promote the idea that you should help other people and if our Dodge Ram can help you help other people then maybe you should get a Dodge Ram right that's basically what the ad is and people are losing their minds about this I just find that utterly insipid the other thing that people are saying about this is how could they use dr. Martin Luther King's words well people like Colin Kaepernick renewing the answer is dr. Martin Luther King would not be kneeling with Colin Kaepernick because dr. Martin Luther King understood that his whole job was to hold on to that flag as tightly as he possibly could and say this flag is mine too and therefore I stand for the flag with you now you stand for me right that was what he was doing so again people who are going after this head I didn't really understand that I thought that it was a little bit over the top okay so time for a quick thing that I hate okay so a couple things one a Colts linebacker was actually killed over the weekend in a DUI the person who killed him was in illegal immigrants the media didn't really report that the his name was Cabrera Gonzalez his name was looking for Alex Cabrillo Gonzalez 37 drove his truck into an emergency shoulder on the highway and plowed into a rideshare vehicle killing Edwin Jackson and 54 year-old Jeffrey Munroe then Salas was booked at Marion County Jail records show he's wanted for deportation he was using an alias his real name apparently is Manuel Arevalo an illegal alien had been deported multiple times from the US once in 2007 and once in 2009 so well done I ns well or ice well done federal government which fails to fix the immigration problem over and over and over another dead American as a result of an illegal immigration problem that you refused to fix so that of course is in the thing that I hate other things that I hate so in the middle of the Super Bowl they did a preview for solo no just no no no no no so here's it will stray a little bit of this I've been running scams on the streets since I was 10 just kicked out of the slide Academy for having a mind my own I'm gonna be a pilot the best in the galaxy kid I'm putting together a crew you win that's yes that might be the only person what you really are what's that okay first of all no no synthesizers please no synthesizers okay yes I see it's the Millennium Falcon yes we've all seen them one in Falken okay so a few things about this preview so it would be the iconic use of the Millennium Falcon over and over and over and over again you can't do it again right I mean you already already did the call back in force awakens and that was nice and now you can't go back to this also Han Solo has the coolest entry in film history right his entrance in in Star Wars Episode four is one of the coolest entrances ever he's literally sitting in a cantina and shoots a guy in the middle of a conversation about how he's a rogue okay that's awesome and yes Han shot first okay and now everybody is in and now you want the backstory like I don't need the backstory he was only 31 when he did I think it was 29 he's a kid when he did when he did Star Wars Episode four and in the movie is supposed to be even younger he's supposed to be like late 20s what could have happened to him that was so formative also I'm not seeing that the tremendous sense of humor that was sort of necessary in in Han Solo Hans whole things that he was cynical and now they're gonna make him if they make him not cynical it's gonna be so obnoxious if they make him just an innocent right the deep down he's good we know deep down he's good but that was the whole discovery of Episode four right why are you ruining it with the whole discovery of Episode four is the deep down Han Solo's good he spends the entire time being a rogue and then he comes back at the end and saves Luke because deep down he's actually a softy that's the whole point just yeah stupid stupid stupid but there was no way it was gonna be good they just maybe it'll surprise me but the reason Rogue one worked is because they were using ancillary characters not because they were trying to recast the original characters is why I think the prequels for for Star Wars don't work I don't want Darth Vader's backstory I just want Darth Vader and rogue one none of these characters were in the main film except for guard fader who appears exactly the way he appears in the main film so so we will see if it is as bad as it looks maybe it won't be I'll go see it anyway because hey it's Star Wars but well we'll save our rip on it for actually seeing it okay quick note on Federalist number fourteen so every week we do an episode of the Federalist Papers in Federalist number 14 is by James Madison this talks about why Republic's work over large regions so Madison writes as the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand and will include no great then can join in those functions the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the center which will barely allow the representatives to meet as often as possible so the idea here is that a republic can only be as large as the capacity to travel to the central point and then travel back home at relative intervals that means that you can have the idea of a large Republic over time you can't have the idea of a large democracy the founders were opposed to direct democracy they liked the idea of a republic they also suggested that because the Republic was so large states would have to have extraordinary powers in order to do all the local services that things would need one of the big problem is now is the federal government has overreached so much that it feels like the federal government does most things and the state government does very few the relationship should be reversed in fact James Madison says were proposed by the plan of the convention to a Polish abolish the governments of the particular states its adversaries would have some ground for their objection though it would not be difficult to show that if they were abolished the general government would be compelled by a principle of self-preservation to reinstate them in proper jurisdiction meaning even if you got rid of state governments you'd have to reinstate them because somebody has to control the locals finally he gives an inspiring statement that's kind of like what I said about the super bowl except more eloquent he said hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of America knit together as they are by so many cords of affection can no longer live together as members of the same family can no longer continued the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness can no longer be fellow citizens of one great respectable and flourishing Empire hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world that has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors that it rationally attempts what is impossible to accomplish no my countrymen shut your ears against this unhallowed language shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys the kindred blood would flood which flows in the veins of American citizens the mingled blood which they've shed in defense of their sacred rights consecrate their union and excite her at the idea of their becoming aliens rivals enemies we should remember that whether we're watching the Superbowl whether were arguing politics or whether we're talking about the American Founding all right we'll be back here tomorrow with much much more I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan
