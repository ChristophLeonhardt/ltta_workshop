00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,352
BEING SEPARATED AT THE BORDER. OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA, NOT SAN

89
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:42,554
OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA, NOT SAN FRANCISCO SO MUCH, BUT

90
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:43,522
FRANCISCO SO MUCH, BUT CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION IS A BIG

91
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:44,923
CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION IS A BIG ISSUE, VERY IMPORTANT.

92
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,858
ISSUE, VERY IMPORTANT. SANCTUARY CITIES ARE ALSO A BIG

93
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:47,859
SANCTUARY CITIES ARE ALSO A BIG ISSUE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

94
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,661
ISSUE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION VOWING TO COME DOWN HARD ON

95
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,062
VOWING TO COME DOWN HARD ON CITIES THAT ARE SANCTUARY

96
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:51,496
CITIES THAT ARE SANCTUARY CITIES.

97
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,730
CITIES. NOT SURE IF SAN FRANCISCO IS

98
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,064

THAT INCLUDES THE MIGRANT POPULATION.

108
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,846
POPULATION. I THINK IT IS HORRIBLE WHAT WE

109
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:11,783
I THINK IT IS HORRIBLE WHAT WE KNOW IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY

110
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,285
KNOW IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY AND HOW WE’RE TALKING ABOUT

111
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,120
AND HOW WE’RE TALKING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEVER LIVED IN

112
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:16,888
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEVER LIVED IN A COUNTRY THAT THEY’RE BEING

113
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,589
A COUNTRY THAT THEY’RE BEING DEPORTED TO.

114
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,057
DEPORTED TO. I THINK IT IS HORRIBLE.

115
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,692
I THINK IT IS HORRIBLE. SEPARATED FROM FAMILIES.

116
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,394
SEPARATED FROM FAMILIES. WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM NOT JUST IN

117
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:23,695
WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OVER THE

118
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:24,129
CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES.

119
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:25,997
UNITED STATES. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

120
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,800
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO ADDRESS AND

121
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,701
DEFINITELY NEED TO ADDRESS AND SADLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

122
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,771
SADLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSED ON REALLY TEARING OUR

00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,207
IS FOCUSED ON REALLY TEARING OUR COUNTRY APART BY MAKING

00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,013
THAT IT IS. BUT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE.

127
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:42,781
BUT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE. SEPARATING PEOPLE AND CALLING

128
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,617
SEPARATING PEOPLE AND CALLING ONE POPULATION IMMIGRANT VERSUS

129
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,018
ONE POPULATION IMMIGRANT VERSUS ANOTHER, IT IS NOT THE RIGHT

130
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:47,819
