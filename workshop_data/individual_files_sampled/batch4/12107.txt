after White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was refused service at the red hen restaurant in Lexington Virginia because of her political beliefs restaurant workers at the red hen are being offered sensitivity training on how to deal with conservatives red hen servers and management will take classes to learn to recognize their implicit biases against conservatives and to note when they might be committing subtle microaggressions against conservatives like putting on ski masks and attacking them with sticks to stop them from expressing their opinions or ganging up on them in angry mobs and chasing them out of public venues while spitting on them in early in four-letter words without the sensitivity training such subtle micro behaviors might go unnoticed because a bigoted American Society has taught leftist that only their opinions are virtuous and therefore anyone who disagrees with them must be evil whereas in fact if you can't discuss your ideas without using four-letter words or resorting to cruelty bullying and violence you may actually be the bad guy at sensitivity training red hen workers will be introduced to such concepts as toxic leftism unearned self-righteousness and anti-american dirtbag eree as well as anti-american dirtbag are' resulting in the unearned self-righteousness of toxic leftism also know is known as just being an all-around d-bag who can't get a lady a sandwich without working your great big stupid mouth during sensitivity training red hen employees will also watch video examples of inherent bias such as newscasts on NBC and CNN they'll also revisit historical and justices against conservatives like the publication of the New York Times we here at the Andrew Clavin show hope that this training will teach employees and management at the red hen how to treat their fellow Americans with respect after which we hope no one goes to this stinking hate-filled restaurant ever again trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show so we need also sing see Topsy the Zipit easing its all right we are back after a particularly disturbing clayvin last weekend we we tried to get the great Michael Knowles to

mean we are now so far ahead of what's happening and the reason is we're not following the narrative we're following the narrative we're not following what the press is telling us the narrative is we are following what the narrative actually is and that's why we're ahead of the game almost every day at this point you know then the press is telling us basically the country's in crisis the people are torn apart the country is divided we hate each other none of that is true the Act they keep saying these are troubled times these are not troubled times these are good times during which the left is angry that's all is that's happening this has happened I've seen this at least twice in my life two big times one Ronald Reagan came in there were lines at the gas stations we had inflation we had unemployment everything was just really awful under the Jimmy Carter Administration Ronald Reagan came in and it was day after day of were going to war with Russia the guy is a madman he's an idiot he's a blithering he's a movie he's a movie star what does he know about the government we thought oh my gosh it's terrible it's a crisis it wasn't a crisis it was good times it was the ship of state being turned around in the right direction which is what the Left hates because they hate this country they hate the West they want their system to work which will give them more power over ordinary folks like us they they do not want this to happen the second time I saw it was Rudy Giuliani came into a New York that had really hit rock bottom I mean New York you could not go out for a pack of gum without taking your life in your hands I was there the city was a cesspool Giuliani came in every single day in the New York Times he was a Nazi he was a bigot there was this one story where a police misused a black suspect and they had this story oh yeah they as they were doing as they were beating him up they said to him it's Giuliani time complete lie that didn't happen they didn't say that I mean they did they did abuse this guy but they didn't say that Giuliani was on it in a split second he came down on the cops like that that he turned that city from one of the worst cities on earth to one of the best and it was him it was him and his Alysse guys that he brought in the police commissioner's and every single day it was just like it is now the crises he's horrible he said this and has obviously meant that and he hates black people the whole thing it's all happening again and why so what's happening this time is because like Giuliani and like Reagan Trump will not stand down he won't run away he won't tell them that his conservatism is compassionate he won't say he's gonna be kinder and gentler he just tells them what he's gonna do and he doesn't he's stood up to them they brought last week they slung everything they had they brought the full Katrina playbook its Donald Trump's fault that the border doesn't work I mean it's so obvious that this was going on during the Reagan administration they threw everything and ran not only and oh and then and then when he said okay you wanted an executive order saying we'll put the kids together as long as we can keep protecting the border fine he signs the executive order that executive order I do not think it's going to stand but it just threw them for a loop because now they're stuck with a situation that only the legislature can solve it's a law it's a problem of bad law and Trump is on the offensive he's going after them he's saying that Obama did this he said Obama put him in cages and wrapped him in foil with his things and he said and he brought out what they call the angel parents I personally hate this thing where they give everybody an emotional name it's the angel parents you know as the dreamers it's I I hate it but it's I guess you got to play the game at this point and he brings in the parents of children who have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals none of our kids had a minute to say goodbye we weren't lucky enough to be separated for five days or 10 days were separated permanently our separation like everybody has said is permanent Sarah never gets to go on to be a wife a mother I brought my son this is what I have left his ashes I wear his ashes in the locket this is how I get to hug my son so so Trump is fighting back on their terms I mean that's what you know this is one of the things I feel so many of my fellow conservatives do not get this especially the kind of never Trump guys they do not get that the battle is not between Republicans and Democrats the battle is between Americanism and the press the battle is between those who believe in the Constitution limited government freedom for the individual and and you know powers at odds with one another the states at odds with the feds the Senator Dobbs with the Congress with the house that legislature at odds with the executive that's what we want we want them fighting with each other so we can be free it is against people who believe in that versus the press versus the socialist press the press the Democrats are run by the press it's not the press it's not the Democrats running the press it's the other way around and they don't understand that that's the fight and that is what Trump is doing so incredibly well so a CBS News poll comes out and it shows that most people agree with Trump build a wall it shows that most people want the illegals deported and it said like 48 percent but when you added all the numbers together it was really a majority said some somehow or other they've got to be sent back you know it's not that people are unkind like me I don't want to see the parents turn away from the children I just want the border secure that's all I want I want us to decide who comes in I want the legislature to get off their patoot and argue with each other and compromise with each other and make a better law and make a better a sensible way that we can defend our borders and all the left wants is they want these these new voters coming in and all the people to wall street journal' want I love that paper but they are just wrong about this is they want people to water their damn lawns and that is what they bring it in because they don't have to get minimum wage they aren't protected like our workers but it's ridiculous it's not restriction espect the law to make sense and the law to be enforced that is not restrictions that's what the wall street journal' keeps calling so they lost they brought it all they brought the whole artillery they brought everything they got and Trump stood up to them and now they are furious so what do they do they move to plan B which is bullying mobster mobster ISM and violence and we will take a look at this in just a minute but first let's talk about something happy to get us in the mood let's talk about bull and branch sheets and you know as you know there's no there's no ease and clayman but there's also no sleeping and claiming I awake all I thought was all night last night with Boleyn branch sheets at least you feel incredible and these sheets look amazing and since Boleyn branch sells exclusively online you

LL and branch calm promo code Clavin bull and branch dot-com promo code Clavin and you say yes now I can spell Bowl but how do you spell Clavin I think is an earworm it's really a point all right so they brought the press and that's their big weapon the big weapon is the press which creates the the illusion that things are terrible oh my god our society is falling apart civil society is collapsing do you think you look I mean look around you is it is it newer Town is it collapsing no it's just in the con the coast where the news is working its will and everywhere where people believe fall for the crisis in the press is no crisis and it's not even a crisis at the border there's confusion this chaos is too long that the legislature of legislature has left this going but right this minute it just needs to be fixed that's all that's all this happening but because Trump won't stand down the people are becoming mobsters and when I say mobsters I mean people who joined together in a mob and terrorized people and encourage each other to do wrong Sarah Sanders walks into the red hen restaurant in Lexington Virginia and they all got together and took a vote and told her she had to leave now you'll notice by the way that Sarah Sanders pick was ready to pay for her meal unlike the trespassers who were at Starbucks she didn't defy the police when they asked her to leave that didn't happen and the police didn't have to come like the trespassers a Starbucks defied the police but somehow when the trespassers as Starbucks were ejected that was a racial incident this is not an incident of bigotry when the guy at the masterpiece cake shop said you know what I cannot put my lend my artistry to a gay wedding that was a travesty but throwing a woman out because she has she works for the administration she's a public servant that's fine and it's all this bullying of women I mean home the Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen was forced out of the Mexican restaurant right we saw that this is another one Florida Attorney General Pam bomb Bondy went to see the documentary about Mister Rogers this come out Mister Rogers who was the what would you call him the ambassador of civility right he was a guy who was talking about bullying him talk about treating people properly while she's standing on line listen to her description of what happened to her a woman approaches me in the ticket line and starts screaming that I was personally ripping babies out of the arms of mothers and they were videoing me and I said I'm glad you're videoing this because I've never agreed with separating the mothers and the babies and I said Congress has to act on this matter and they said no it's you these babies are being kept and then because I was talking normally to them they didn't know what to do so then three huge guys came up and started probably an inch from my face screaming at me every word in the book cursing as loud as they could so then a trooper my trooper came up and my boyfriend and I got our tickets were headed in and then they ran in and circled me where I could not get into the theater they stopped me so he came up then and stopped them so then we went into theater thought it was defused we're up getting popcorn at the concession stand and they came up again just every curse word in the book and they said to him hey blue eyes come on aren't you gonna protect her using a lot of X you know a lot of other words too so they start trying to start a fight with her boyfriend they're terrorizing this woman a mob is terrorizing this public servant this lady they're surrounding her they're spitting on her they're cursing at her okay and they think they're the good guys that's the amazing thing that is the magic of leftism the black magic of leftism is that it allows you to think you're the good guys while you're wearing a ski mask and hitting somebody on the head with a stick because he wants to make a speech imagine the black magic of leftism is that it allows you to think that you're a good person while you're terrifying and terrorizing a young woman luckily I mean there are these lunatics out there trying to incite this kind of violence but luckily none of them is like an elective oh wait you know Maxine Waters this woman this woman really needs to be dead I came out of Congress possibly in a straightjacket here is she's giving a speech to people and listen to them cheering from what she says she is encouraging this kind of mob violence and terror and by the way left-wingers remember when you start to play by these rules the other side starts playing by him too and it's not going to be pretty but listen this is Maxine Waters this is an unbelievably irresponsible moment yeah that's what Jesus preached right if you see someone disagree if thou see someone who disagrees that's the honorable thing that Jesus preached mm with whom you have a political disagreement terrorised laments around the minimum and it is I swear the black magic of leftism that these people think they're the good guys they are cheering this they're sitting there cheering this lunatic who shouldn't be in Congress anyway should really be in a padded cell and in their chair and they think they're the good guys it is a wonder I mean you know Peter Fonda did this thing all this stuff in Hollywood where he had that tweet where he said we should rip Baron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if mother will stand up against the giant a-hole she is married to he he apologized to that after like ice assume he sobered up he apologized for that but still I mean well those words come out of your mouth how do you still think you know you know I always say anger is the devil's cocaine and what I mean by that is it makes you think you're being righteous because you feel this righteous anger this is what's happening to them and and here's the the key thing because Trump has a in expertise he has a power to make them expose themselves for who they are they are slowly slowly coming around to show that it's not Trump they hate it's you when Hillary Clinton came out and talked about the deplorable Xand that really did help - for her to lose the election when she attacked the voters she was speaking for the media she was speaking for Hollywood she really was I mean take a look at this here's Rob Reiner mr. Hollywood right big powerful Hollywood director and his wife they're talking to joy read listen Hui to listen who he's blaming here let it's not Trump they hate it's you let's cut to the chase this is about racism this is pure and simple racism that's all it says he's hoping that the people who support him will be ginned up and and and running to the polls to make sure that brown people don't come into America that's exactly what's going on here the political people in his on his team believe that the base of the Republican Party will be more moved by this by separating brown children and parents than they will for instance by his tax cut because that's not what they're selling they're telling him no this is the issue that makes you look strong because I hate to repeat what he just said but this is based on racism period as they like to say that's all this is they they don't want more brown people coming into this country and taking those jobs immigration is lower than it's ever been there's no crisis at the border and it's just an inhuman unconscionable act that they did by separating children I have to tell you my mother was announcements she got separated from her entire family lost her entire family I never thought I would live to see something like that particularly in this country ever again in my lifetime that's amazing I can't think of any other reason you might want to enforce the laws of your border I can't it's just about brown because we don't have any brown people in America you know we want to keep this as a lily-white country and that you know what was she talking about you know what country is she in what imaginary land the she in but it's you and Joe Scarborough and Donny I don't even know Donny Deutsch is like an ad executive what why is he a commentator do I did I miss something where he can became an expert in something anyway Joe's listened to this conversation on Morning Joe and I know it's MSNBC I don't like to pick on them because they're an openly left-wing station but I just want to show that it's not Trump they're hating on it is you it is us and is the deplorable listen to this we can no longer say Trump's the bad guy if you vote for Trump you're the bad guy if you vote for Trump you are ripping children from parents onto the mistake that we've made in the past is look at that bad guy over there look at that bad guy what the Democrats have to do is make the next election a referendum I'm not who Trump is but who you are and we all that that's the big difference you can no longer now as a voter because it's now not about taxes it's not even about some abstract term of immigration or or nationalism if you vote for Trump then you the voter you not Donald Trump or standing at the BART border like Nazis going you hear you hear and I think we now have to flip it and it's a given the evilness of Donald Trump but if you vote you can no longer separate yourself you can't say well he's okay but and I think that gymnastics and I think that jiu-jitsu has to happen he's been openly racist just like we said back in December of 2015 openly racist and if you support him then you're supporting that and you are that it's that simple so you see the logic of this right the logic of this is this it's because because they can be no other reason to enforce the law except racism they can be no other reason to want your borders to be secure except racism it is perfectly reasonable to surround women in movie theaters and gas stations as Maxine Waters and restaurants and bully them out of those places if they're in the cabinet but but it's not just them right because if you voted for them then you are complicit so now it's alright to do this stuff to you as well you can see where this is going somebody's gonna get hurt and then it's gonna be oh I don't know why it's really Trump's faulty he inspired it's really his fault it's gonna be their fault they are working this up to a moment of violence and it's not gonna be pretty because believe me some of us are perfectly willing and able to fight back and once they start that fight they are not gonna like it and I'm not gonna like it either I do not want to see this country at that kind of odds the fact is things are going well Trump is doing a good job I've said all my complaints about Trump I'm not gonna go through him again but Trump is doing a good job he's exhibiting leadership he is breaking things up a little bit he's changing things I'm still you know I'm still on the on the fence about what he's doing with trade because I want to see where it goes I want to see how much of it is negotiation but that this country is doing better than it has done in a long long time and these guys are angry because their policy because they went through eight years of failure with their King their God their Messiah and it didn't work they lied to us they let him corrupt the government and now this new guys coming in he's doing all this stuff they hate and it's working and so no wonder they're screaming in yelling but calling for violence against people and attacking the voters instead of the the official that you dislike it's really is disgusting and I just have to add this one thing and then we're gonna get to Michael Noel's about this Harvard stuff this time magazine cover so classic so typical it's all about the narrative they put up this magazine little kid crying Donald Trump looking down at her and it says welcome to America it's a big red splash cover turns out the little girl was from Honduras her mother abandoned her family carried her illegally across the border she wasn't separated the whole story the whole story was fake the whole story was fake and they have time magazine's editor-in-chief Edward Felson fall he defends it he says yeah well you know you know it's the old story that the facts were wrong but the narrative was right I mean like I said I'm a novelist for me I can have the facts wrong in the narrative right if you're a journalist the facts are the narrative the facts determined the narrative it's not the other way around listen to the sky tie him self knots of dishonesty defending what was in just an entire line of visual why that his magazine Time magazine told we chose the photo because this little girl became the face of this story on front pages and home pages and TV screens but maybe shouldn't have been the face of this story if she wasn't separated from her mom well you know as John just said and has said all along none of us in the media who used the photo knew what had happened to the girl after this precise moment and I actually think part of the power of the image is that unknown this was a girl face who's coming to America has just completed one terrifying journey and whatever its contours whatever happens to her faces another very frightening journey as well but by Monday of this week we knew that she hadn't been separated from her mom in fact on Tuesday you all issued a correction to a web story about that we that's I don't that's I don't believe the case we we did make an error which obviously I regret and and hate it as make hate making errors anytime but we made an error a web story early in the week not part of the cover package in which we said that the mother had been separated and we quickly and transparently corrected that we didn't know nobody using this photo new on Monday or Tuesday that they had not been separated what we do according to the government they had not been separated we we just knew there was a crying child than anywhere a child cries Donald Trump it gets the blame I mean that's basically it is the logic the logic it burns the logic here is so amazing because if the narrative sets the story then the facts can't penetrate these guys even even after the fact leavin if I know we got the story wrong no apology nothing nothing it's like we know what the narrative is but we don't need I don't need no stinking facts we don't need no stinking facts we put up cover there that facts Trump that's what you know that's what these guys are doing and they they cannot see it themselves it is really wonderful it is the black magic of leftism then they can think they're the good guys while lying to their audience it is just an amazing thing all right speaking of black magic we have Michael Knowles coming up in just a moment I gotta say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but come on over to the daily wire.com you can listen to the rest you can listen to the rest on YouTube if you like but while you're at the daily wire.com you can do something else which is subscribe yeah cheap son of a gun subscribe give us your lousy ten bucks a month and what will we do for you ah no will well let you

few things but he knows everything so he can solve all your problems alright we got Michael Noel's coming on up NOLs hey pretty good good to be back I did yeah I was away for the weekend I didn't see you what you've been up to so I went ice usually you make me see bad babies ha ha but you didn't make me see this bad oh yeah I saw it anyway yeah I saw Incredibles - oh did you see it I know I saw the first one the first one was one of the great animated picture this one I mean I'm I'm probably gonna put a good ten minutes into this on the show today because there's so much to delve into yeah but yes the mind people you got remind people what Incredibles was because it was really a conservative movie it's a fabulous movie and by the way I had never seen the first one okay so sweet little and Lisa now Saint little ELISA because she's married to me she wanted to go see the sequel so she said you should watch the first one I said okay the first one is this movie about these superheroes and but then they're outlawed you know so the family has to kind of go into hiding because there's a special right there - there - much better than ordinary yeah - excellent and what the movies really about is a midlife crisis and a middle-aged guy settling into suburbia and in dealing with his family in this new stage of life and it's a terrific movie it's a real movie about something and this movie ruins all of that no it managed it really does it undercuts so much of the first movie so some people or I wrote a review of it and some people are getting angry they say oh I liked this sequel and I said the sequel is fine compared to everything else that's coming out of Hollywood right now yeah compared to that first one it's really a huge decay it's a it's real what do they do rush what's wrong it's all it's just feminism it I should have as I'm ruined if I've learned anything from the Andrew Clavin show it's that feminism ruins and rings everything it is like this toxic gas that just people you don't know why suddenly the guy next to falls over and it is you can't see it it's just that's it I mean and there's unfortunately the Incredibles it would it would be one thing if this were just a standalone movie but that first Incredibles did so much to fight against yeah that poisonous narrative and then this one just at is just at nevermind alright well listen let's let us talk this story out of Harvard I mean everything everything you is everything black is white everything up is down everything right is wrong it is talked about what's happening in Harvard they're basically establishing racial quotas again right they have a stay yeah everything is black is white that's a good way to intro it that's exactly what this is this is all about racial quotas and there's a group called as students for fair admissions which is finally bringing suit against Harvard for its obvious racial quotas so there's a famous case in 1978 Regents of University of California versus bok-bok e ba KK I remember this is when I started this is the first thing that made me start to turn from liberal to conservative yes and the case basically said there is a benefit in admissions for racial diversity so you can deal with that but you can't have racial quotas to which any reasonable person would say what what excuse me so you can consider race but you can't consider race right that's basically what they're saying and look we've all known this I was in college not that long ago and by the way it is such a pleasure to see Harvard getting dragged from the mud these days yeah the last five years has just been Yale has been one crazy thing after another we all knew this happened everybody knows it especially at these top schools there are racial quotas they do harm Asians there that's that's what it's about right is about yes so there won't be that many Asians because Asians work hard and they study Arden yeah because Asians are too successful academically so the idea is plumbing keep keep down the keep down the age of the Yellow Peril basically the Yellow Peril and this I won't even call it an open secret it does a disservice to secrets this is just utterly unknown right and so just here are some numbers to put this into perspective okay if only academic achievement were considered this is according to a study by the way they've got this great key witness Peter Archie diakon Oh an economist from Duke University he's the plaintiffs key witness he did this huge study if only academic achievement were considered in Harvard admissions the asian-american portion of the student body would jump from nineteen percent where it is to 43 percent hmm forty that is amazing that are may well good for them so they're working hard so they're working very hard now even if you allow because look universities want athletes they want Legos okay fair enough fair enough I give it to them yeah even then the Asian population would be 31% okay now if you account for extracurriculars and certain personal leadership or whatever this is where it starts to get murky but and and also also it really cuts this argument is deeply undermined by the other findings but let's just say hypothetically that Asian students didn't do all these extracurriculars they weren't student leaders blah blah whatever okay the percentage would still be 26% and yet the real percentage is 18 to 19 percent so we're missing some Asians we're missing a lot of Asians what is going on well what's going on is that there's another demographic that there are another category that's been found called demographic and we don't really know what this category is Harvard is releasing documents they hadn't owned their own internal investigation which showed that they were biased against Asians and then so they're releasing documents highly redacted so now the plaintiffs point to those documents that say see there's discrimination and Harvard says well you're using redacted evidence you know get into Harvard for nothing so so wait I read that they're going they're basically claiming that Asians don't have nice personalities yes that's the way they're that's the way they're hitting so this this category this kind of murky category demographic all we know about it is it bumps up the number of hispanics and black applicants who get in and it's a penalty for being Asian the way they're hitting them is because they can't hit them on this test scores radiations do the best on the test scores on SAT on a number of APs passed on GPA they by the way they even have more extracurriculars than the average applicant who's getting in so even that argument goes away they're they're ranking them on likability helpfulness courage kindness no I wait wait I kid you not you're joking you mean this is from the Harvard evaluation give me those again slow that down this is what their ranking Asian students are all students like yes on what quality on the personal score this effluence pay attention yeah yeah likability likability okay helpfulness yeah courage yeah kindness positive personality you know instead of a negative personality people like to be around them and the person is widely respected so I gotta tell you drew yeah I have never liked to be around those those miserable cruel Asians so Harvard Harvard position now is that nobody likes to be around Asians that's right any Asian czar not courageous and they're not helpful and yeah no way Harvard's position is there a class on like how to recognize an Asian so you do get stay away from I mean you know there there are these things called implicit biases within Harvard people Rams about I think this is an explicit bias and you know by the way the crazy thing here is if you look at the Alumni interviewers when you apply to these schools you interview with an alumnus and when the alumni interviewers rate the Asian students they put them basically on par with white students there's not really much of a difference on personality or whatever okay the admissions officers at Harvard basically never meet the Asians that they're giving way lower personality scores to there is obviously an unwritten policy in place an asian-american male student who has a 25% chance of admission to Harvard would have a 32% chance of white a 77% chance if Hispanic and a 95% chance if black according to this study this is just a way to to knock the Asians to really hit them this study by the ways is a review of a hundred sixty thousand student files it's not like things are yeah so they did this to the Jews right I mean it's exactly what the the Ivy League's used to do to Jews this is exactly what the Ivy League's used to do to Jews in the 1930s because they said the Jews are too smart that's too smart they're too smart they're too hardworking we can't wait what do you want your whole university to be Jewish and what's funny is back then you know these universities especially I'll say Yale were like just grooming schools for waspy young men right right yes that's right that's why you went do and that's why you went yeah but it isn't that I mean these universities now are supposed to be the meritocracy right if you get in these these schools have like four percent admission rates they're pretty low if you get in you're supposed to be the the you know the best of the best the crème de la creme and they're hurting these Asian students and by the way in New York our old town the Mayor Bill DeBlasio comrade de Blasio he was trying to ruin all of the top feeder schools into these universities Wow in New York unless you play the game of the private schools which begins I think and the third trimester believe me I was there I did it I played that game yes they if you're a poor person or an immigrant or something and by the way Asian there are more poor Asians in New York than any demographic racial demographic you have to apply to get into one of the five top high schools ok Stuyvesant Bronx science right right a handful of others yeah if you get into those schools you have a chance of going to an elite University otherwise you're not going to right and the Stuyvesant is a mostly Asian I think it's 70% plus Asian why because the parents scrimp and save and the kids work hard and they spend their summers summers doing test prep and they get into those schools bill de blasio says that's not fair to many Asians the same exact policy that we're seeing at Harvard and it's just pure racial discrimination it's pure racial discrimination and it destroys these schools I mean they destroyed City College used to be a launch pad for poor Jews who got out and work their way into college and they got out and they just said oh no too many Jews basically and they destroyed the university you know these guys I've been talking today about the black magic of leftism which is allows you to become the scum of the earth while thinking you're the good guy you know you can surround a woman with a mob scream curse at her spit on her and think like ah I'm a I'm a great person I mean it's a wonder it is a wonderful I want some of that medicine man I won't be able and bully women and think yes but I'm a leftist so I'm nice you know this is a perfect example of this this is racism it is racism I kid you not there was a Korean student who was criticizing these anti Asian discrimination policies yeah at MIT and the Dean of Admissions there referred to this kid at Daniel Goldin as yet another texture 'less math grind oh you've got to be kidding yes I mean that's that is the sort but they're the good people yeah they're the that's that's the no what what are you talking about on your show there's an amazing story what else are you talking about you showed it today we're gonna be talking about how you can act like a man to follow the advice of Don Corleone and Donald Trump Donald don don Trump to Jimmy Fallon recently all of we're gonna we're gonna analyze some of the masculinity that's going on in our foreign policy and our domestic policy in our culture and we're gonna have to get to the incredibles because it's just a little animated kids movie but there is so much there that shows the decline of culture unbelievable thanks a lot those good nights he drew our crappy culture so here is something that I feel actually has a level of profundity to it the Little House on the Prairie the author's name Laura Ingalls Wilder I'm sure some of you may know her from old reruns of the Little House on the Prairie TV show but she wrote a series of books that were a memoir of the way West her father was kind of a who's kind of an heir do well really he took them all out west and they lived in a at one point they lived in a little dugout house and then they had the Little House on the Prairie and this I don't know how many there are eight or ten books that are apparently well actually I read one of them I read the first one of them and it was very well-written incredibly descriptive and her name has been on a prestigious children's book award the wilder award for children's book she has that name has now been removed by the American Library Association because in these books they're written they were published back in the 30s I think she talks about the Indians she talks about blacks with with what today would be considered insensitivity she's writing in her time she did in fact herself rescind some of it at one point she said something like there were no people there there only Indians and she said that she herself said no that was that was the wrong way to put that I there are no settlers they were only Indian she changed it and so there the American Library Association says that Wilders work includes expressions of stereotypical attitudes inconsistent with the organization's core values of inclusiveness integrity and respect and responsiveness and they said the author's legacy is complex and not universal embrace and God forbid as an author you should not be universally embraced I mean I they you know if you were an author if you were telling anything like the truth if you have any kind of vision at all you're not going to be universally embraced but let's for a minute just accept the idea that attitudes were different then the life you know there's one scene in one of the little house in the prairies books where these women are sitting there by themselves and these naked Indians come in and it's terrifying they were terrified and people did get killed out there and you know so they were scared but let's just say that the attitudes change we understand that but this is part of our history and part of what leftism does is it disconnects us from our past and our past is wet you know the past we're in it we're on a continuum we're not here we didn't just drop out of here with all our ideas we've got our ideas from the past they came they worked they evolved I hope they got better I hope they've got purified but you don't cut your supply line off from those ideas by ditching everybody who doesn't live in your moment it's this prejudice against the past it's a form of bigotry we are only holding this position here for the future we're part of this continuum that is the way culture works that is the way advancement works we you know listen I've said this before I will say it again there are people today who had their names and airports and statues one day when the science is clearer and everybody can see what abortion is those statues are going to be torn down they're gonna be people out there going Nancy Pelosi are you kidding me you named a road after this woman who supported abortion are you joking same people who were tearing down statues of robert e lee we respect the past because we are the products of the past and everything that happened there good and bad created us as we are and we hope that we learn from the bad things and we hope that we added on to the good things but Laura Ingalls Wilder while there was a wonderful writer who supplied a incredibly in-depth and vivid vision of what it was like to settle the West and you don't take her name off anything you don't take her name off anything you respect her you can say you know there's you can talk about the fact that her time was different that the attitudes changed but that's part of how you learn is by looking back at the past and seeing how you've changed not by telling the past to be silent just incredibly embarrassing stupid big thing for librarians to do they're way way too many left wing librarians are really need to get a little bit of diversity have you ever heard of diversity didn't get a little bit of diversity room found those librarians alright that's the
