and I want you to know it's a measure of
my of my trust that as soon as I got
into this excellent Foreign Minister I
immediately handed my coat my hat my
gloves and indeed everything that was in
my pocket secret or otherwise to Sergei
Lavrov in the knowledge that he would
look after it and and would come to to
no harm and you know look yes we you
know I'm just going to repeat my my
central message things have been
difficult and are difficult between our
two countries but there is much we can
work on together and every reason to
build trust now will that do there's
nothing in the pockets of voices say
these you searched it already
