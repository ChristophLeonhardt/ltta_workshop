ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY HARASSED A FORMER STAFF AND WILL PAY BACK THE MONEY PAID TO SETTLE THAT CASE. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO? ATLANTIC CITY GIVEN UP FOR DEAD A FEW YEARS AGO. ODDS FOR A COMEBACK ARE IN ITS FAVOR. HERE'S RICK. ONCE CALLED THE 8th GREATEST WONDER OF THE WORLD. THE TRUMP WAS THE LAST OF 5 CASINOS TO GIVE UP ON ATLANTIC CITY. MANY PREDICTED THE END WAS NEAR FOR THIS ONCE BOOMING TOWN. BUT THE BOOM IS BACK. 2 SHIRTED CASINOS ARE REOPENING THIS SUMMER. 7 OTHERS HAVE STABILIZED EARNINGS AND ALL WERE IN THE BLACK LAST YEAR. ONE TURNED A $300 MILLION PROFIT. HIGH END APARTMENTS ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS ARE WAITING TO BE FILLED WITH MILITARY VETERANS GETTING AN EXTRA LOOK SINCE VET UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGHER HERE. I HOPE TO GET A JOB IN BUSINESS OR ACCOUNTING. AND YOU? JUST OPEN TO DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES. WE REALIZE THIS IS OUR BEST SECOND CHANCE. WE WON'T GET THIS AGAIN. THIS IS AN ENERGY IN THE INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT REALIZING WE HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT THIS TIME. I LIKE TO CALL IT THE REBIRTH. THE MAYOR SAID THE KEY TO THE COME BACK IS MAKING SURE LOCALS ARE INVOLVED. WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT, YOU CAN'T HAVE A CLEAN CITY. WITHOUT A CLEAN CITY, YOU WON'T HAVE INVESTORS INTERESTED IN COMING TO THE CITY. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THE AT BOTTOM. BUT AT THE BOTTOM IT LOOKS SCAREY. JOE IS PART OF THE TEAM REBUILDING THE HARD ROCK HOTEL AND CASEIN AND CASEI AND CASIN AND CASINO AND CASIN AND CASINO AND CASINO. INVESTIGATING $500 MILLION. OFFERING 300 LIVE SHOWS A YEAR. WE HAVE THROWS TO 30 MILLION PEOPLE WITHIN A 3 HOUR DRIVE OF ATLANTIC CITY. YOU HAVE THE WORLD FAMOUS BOARD WALK AND BEECHES AND WE CAN RE-ENERGIZE THAT. THE HARD ROCK'S GRAND OPENING IS JUNE 28TH. THEY ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. PEOPLE SAY THE TOWN IS READY.
