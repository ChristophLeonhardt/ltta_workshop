1
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:01,127
I lost my job
and all my benefits completely.

2
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,733
They're literally
saving my life.

3
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:12,472
Until you've lost your health,

4
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,808
you don't know how
much you've lost.

5
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:28,455
I'd like to think that there's
a way to provide health care

6
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,224
to the millions of the people
in this country that don't have

7
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,026
the care that they need.

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,133
We're not a solution to the
Affordable Care Act or whatever

9
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,569
the next Affordable Care Act
is going to be.

10
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,506
I see in places like Kentucky
and Tennessee and Appalachia,

11
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,041
where you have large
numbers of people that

12
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,254
voted for the new
administration,

13
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,812
they're all expecting that
something good

14
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,880
is going to happen.

15
00:01:53,880 --> 00:00:00,000
I really hope that it does.
