welcome back tonight I'm obsessed with everyone else's obsession with the first lady's let's submit bizarre perplexing forehead smacking fashion statement I didn't care but a lot of people did and I'm trying to figure out why you saw it we all did the green raincoat with the words scrawled on the back I really don't care to you she might not have really cared but a lot of people really did the media well they could only focus on one thing what Melania was wearing her jacket jacket the jacket jacket jacket the jacket what's happening she might be just thrown it on like I just grabbed whatever the mic like it wasn't just like a white grabbed it out of the closet by race okay so it was a message obviously was not intended to show any sort of message did it mean this or did it mean that either this wasn't a message or it is a message was it aimed at somebody in her family was it aimed at somebody else we're all kind of obsessed with it no we're not look we can all debate whether her choice was appropriate which is an appropriate thing to debate but a nagging question remains if she was referencing anything at all what on earth was she referencing the media society couldn't be the kids could it the message couldn't have been more unclear and subject to interpretation if she had a Rorschach blot H on the back I see a butterfly and my childhood perhaps this is like Laurel and yanny and gold dress and blue dress thing each opinion is right yet somehow also completely wrong or maybe our collective eyes were just playing tricks on us I see you there older woman wait now I see the younger woman whatever she meant by that jacket if she meant anything at all trust me I don't think it makes a very good motto to you we'll be right back hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more beat the press content every morning in the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mind set right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
