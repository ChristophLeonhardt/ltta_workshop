1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,250
THE SUPREME COURT HAS HANDED
DOWN A DECISION IN REGARD

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,960
TO DONALD TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN AND
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY HAVE

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,769
DECIDED TO UPHOLD IT.

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:14,500
REMEMBER THAT THIS BAN HAD TO
BE REWRITTEN TWICE AND THE

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,360
THIRD VERSION OF IT IS WHAT
THE SUPREME COURT MADE THE

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:31,310
RULING ON.

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,079
I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE
COURT'S DECISION WAS SPLIT AMONG

8
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,180
THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES AND
THE LIBERAL JUSTICES.

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:49,390
WE WILL GET TO THE DISSENTING
OPINION IN JUST A MINUTE.

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:58,929
THE 
LOWER COURTS HAD ESSENTIALLY

11
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,170
REFERRED BACK TO THE

12
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,030
COMMENTS TRUMP HAD MADE DURING
HIS CAMPAIGN AND THE TWEETS

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,700
HE PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA JUST
SHOWING HIS UTTER DISDAIN

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,590
FOR MUSLIMS AND HOW HE WANTED TO
DO A MUSLIM BAND WHICH IS

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,580
AGAINST OUR CONSTITUTION.

16
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,520
ONCE HE GOT TO THE SUPREME
COURT, THE CONSERVATIVE

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,390
JUDGES ESSENTIALLY ARGUED THAT
DESPITE WHAT HE WAS SAYING

18
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,930
DURING HIS CAMPAIGN AND DESPITE
THESE TWEETS, WE BELIEVE

19
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,100
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE
AUTHORITY TO BAN TRAVEL

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,900
FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF IT IS
A NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,310
THIS IS NUANCED, AND THE
LAW AT STAKE HERE HAS TWO

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,170
DIFFERENT PARTS THAT ARE VERY
IMPORTANT.

23
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:58,970
I'M QUOTING THE WASHINGTON POST
HERE.

24
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,480
UNDER THAT RUBRIC, YOU WOULD SAY
TRUMP APPARENTLY HAS THE

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,870
AUTHORITY TO DO IT EVEN IF IT IS
NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT

26
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,449
THE CHALLENGERS POINTED OUT
ANOTHER SECTION OF THE LAW WHICH

27
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,319
SAYS A PERSON MAY NOT BE DENIED
A VISA BECAUSE:

28
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,620
THAT IS 
EQUALLY CLEAR AND

29
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,849
THAT MEANS YOU CANNOT BAN

30
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,430
MUSLIMS BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY
COME FROM.

31
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,250
THAT IS WHY THE COURTS WERE
SPLIT ON IT.

32
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,489
THERE ARE GOOD ARGUMENTS TO BE
MADE THERE.

33
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,010
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AS
USUAL, BLUNDERED THEIR WAY

34
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,390
INTO THIS.

35
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,870
TRUMP SAID OVER AND
OVER AGAIN IN THE CAMPAIGN

36
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,310
AND THEN AFTERWARD, IT IS THE
MUSLIMS, WE HAVE TO STOP THEM.

37
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,370
WE JUST STOPPED ALL MUSLIMS FROM
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY, A TOTAL

38
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,340
BAN HE SAID UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

39
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,409
IT WAS INCREDIBLY CLEAR THAT HE
WAS DOING IT BECAUSE THEY ARE

40
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:57,000
MUSLIMS WHICH CLEARLY VIOLATES
THE LAW, BUT AFTER THE

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,209
FIRST TRY THEY REALIZED, WE
CANNOT BAN ALL MUSLIMS, DAMMIT.

42
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,750
THEN THEY HAD A SECOND TRY THAT
ALSO DIDN'T WORK AND IN THE

43
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,389
THIRD TRY WAS LIKE I GOT IT, WE
WILL INCLUDE VENEZUELA AND NORTH

44
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,760
KOREA ON THE LIST AND THAT WAS
ENOUGH FOR CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,269
ON THE SUPREME COURT GO, I MEAN,
ON THE THIRD TRY THEY DID

46
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,180
INCLUDE NON-MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND
SO IT COULD HAVE NATIONAL

47
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,029
SECURITY INTEREST IN ALL THESE
COUNTRIES I GUESS IT IS

48
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,390
GOING TO BE OKAY.

49
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,079
THEY JUST NEEDED A TINY THEN
READ TO HANG THEIR HAT ON

50
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,900
TO COMBINE TWO DIFFERENT PHRASES
AND THEY DID, GOOD ENOUGH,

51
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,529
IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL.

52
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:37,440
WELL, THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE
OF WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
PREVENT THE ELECTION OF SOMEONE
LIKE DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,639
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO NOMINATE A
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

55
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,480
THAT IS WHAT HE DID WITH NEIL
GORESUCH AND HE VOTED WITH THE

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,200
CONSERVATIVES AS WAS EXPECTED ON
THIS VERY ISSUE.

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,690
I THINK THIS RULING SETS A
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.

58
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,959
IT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
UNDER TRUMP, OBVIOUSLY, BUT EVEN

59
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,159
IF YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS
A POLITICAL IDEOLOGY THAT YOU

60
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,169
AGREE WITH BUT THAT PERSON
WANTS TO BAN TRAVEL FROM A

61
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,939
COUNTRY FOR RACIAL REASONS,
RELIGIOUS REASONS,

62
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,668
WHATEVER, NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO
DO IT.

63
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:19,939
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CLAIM I
PERCEIVE THIS COUNTRY TO BE

64
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,240
A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, SO
I'M GOING TO BAN TRAVEL.

65
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,729
IT IS NOT A GOOD PRESIDENT TO
SET AND THE SUPREME COURT

66
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,139
HAS MADE ITS RULING.

67
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,449
PRESUMABLY A DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENT COULD COME IN AND

68
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:33,550
THEY WOULD NEVER DO THIS.

69
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,740
AS I WAS SAYING IT, THE RIGHT
WINGS THINK THAT DEMOCRATIC

70
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
PRESIDENTS WOULD WANT US.

71
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,400
WE ARE BANNING ALL WHITE
COUNTRIES.

72
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,310
PREPOSTEROUS, BUT THAT IS THE
THING.

73
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,060
THAT IS WHY IT IS SO ONE-SIDED,
REPUBLICANS DO WANT TO

74
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,900
DISCRIMINATE AND DEMOCRATS
DON'T.

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,830
THEY GET TO DISCRIMINATE IN THE
OTHER SIDE DOESN'T.

76
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,320
I DON'T WANT ANY DISCRIMINATION
BUT IT IS NOT GOOD THAT THE

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
RIGHT-WING DOES IT.

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,150
THE TRAGIC PART IS YES, TRUMP
WENT.

79
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,099
MITCH MCKENNA LATER BRAGS THAT
IT WAS HIS PROUDEST MOMENT TO

80
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,620
BLOCK MERRICK GARLAND FROM
THE COURT FOR OVER A YEAR IN

81
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,740
RECORD-BREAKING OBSTRUCTION LIKE
HAHA, YOU DIDN'T FIGHT BACK AND

82
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,919
THEN WE TRASH WHATEVER RULES WE
NEED TO TRASH IN THE SENATE TO

83
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,090
APPROVE GORESUCH.

84
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,840
DON'T EVER PROTEST, DON'T EVER
HARASS ANY OF THESE PEOPLE

85
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,819
IF YOU SEE THEM IN PUBLIC, NEVER
FIGHT BACK, YOU NEED TO BE

86
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,070
CIVIL IF YOU ARE ON THE LEFT,
THIS IS THE REASON WHY I AM

87
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,860
DONE WITH IT.

88
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,530
THE FUNNY PART IS ROBERTS
SAID THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT TO USE

89
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,940
A REASONABLE OBSERVER STANDARD.

90
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,449
SOTO MAYOR HAD ARGUED ANY
REASONABLE OBSERVER, AND THAT IS

91
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:51,070
A LEGAL STANDARD, WOULD SEE THAT
DONALD TRUMP CLEARLY NEEDS HE

92
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,721
WANTS A MUSLIM BAN BECAUSE HE
KEEPS SAYING IT OVER AND

93
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:53,721
OVER AGAIN.

94
00:05:53,721 --> 00:06:00,180
THAT IS WHY WE'RE NOT GOING TO
USE THIS STANDARD, WE'RE GOING

95
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,180
TO

96
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,319
USE A STANDARD CALLED RATIONAL
BASIS FOR REVIEW.

97
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,319
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

98
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,340
IT MEANS IF THERE IS ANY
PLAUSIBLE REASON WHY THEY MIGHT

99
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,350
HAVE DONE IT FOR A LEGITIMATE
REASON, WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT

100
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,281
THERE PROBABLY IS, IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT HE DID NOT MEAN

101
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,281
ALL

102
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:18,281
MUSLIMS.

103
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,610
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE DID NOT
MEAN HE WANTS TO DISCRIMINATE.

104
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,159
GOOD ENOUGH.

105
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,000
THAT IS THE LOWEST STANDARD YOU
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,840
DID ANY OF THE CONSERVATIVE
JUSTICE IS NO, NO

107
00:06:27,840 --> 00:00:00,000
REASONABLE PERSON THINK IT'S
ANYTHING BUT A MUSLIM BAN.
