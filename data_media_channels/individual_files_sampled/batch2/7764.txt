researchers for from Stanford University looked into a possible cancer vaccine and through their clinical trials on mice found that the vaccine is incredibly effective and they're planning on testing the vaccine on humans very soon now the treatment stimulates the body's immune system to attack cancer cells in studies in mice with various cancers including lymphoma breast cancer and colon cancer the treatment eliminated cancer tumors in eighty seven out of nine team ice even when the tumors had spread to other parts of the body now the word vaccine is being used by the researchers here but this treatment works differently from traditional vaccines now traditionally vaccines prevent diseases in this case the cancer already exists however the treatment is injected into the tumor and it strengthens the immune system to help the body fight the cancer and not only that tumor but all other tumors that have spread to the rest of that individual's body so researchers from Stanford will test the therapy in about 35 people with lymphoma by the end of the year so let's get into the Nitty Gritty of the science and how this treatment works the treatment contains a combination of two agents that stimulate t-cells a type of immune cell to attack cancer normally the body's t-cells recognize cancer cells as abnormal and will infiltrate and attack them but as a tumor grows it suppresses the activity of the t-cells so that these cells can no longer keep the cancer at bay but this treatment would essentially empower those t-cells to keep fighting researchers inject the vaccine directly into the tumor the two agents in the treatment work synergistically in attacking that's t-cells because these t-cells were already inside the tumors they have essentially been pre-screened by the body to recognize cancer specific proteins and so again it has been rather successful in these trials involving mice but there have been other trials using other treatments that have been successful with mice but it didn't transfer to humans so hopefully this will be successful in trials involving humans but we'll see it's kind of early but it is still it's fine to be optimistic it's always good to be optimistic about this what I think is interesting is that a vaccine I usually think of as preventative and this is a little bit more reactionary which is fine but it's just interesting to see how we're developing the technology and the medicinal science to deal with cancer and it's probably not going to be the way that I would have expected I sort of thought that within my lifetime we would maybe have some sort of a vaccine or something and perhaps it if this goes through then you would sort of have to contract cancer first and then you can deal with it so we'll see how this rolls out there's so many different kinds of cancers and it's happening at a cellular level and cells begin to misfire and so it involves a lot of different biological systems so I think that's one of the reasons it's hard to come up with you know the cure for cancer in any of our lifetime I've said it before I don't approve of the use of animals and any of these experiments it's it's an awful thing these animals suffer and they're tortured and then they're destroyed which means killed at the end of this and then to what Anna says it's not an accurate predictor of what will happen with people the only way you can actually do this is with double-blind studies with human beings because in overwhelming cases it's not a predictor it doesn't show the indication again I don't mean to rain on the parade this might be a great drug but the only way we'll know is the next step as Anna says when they do the double-blind study in humans with tumors so it hopefully is good news and as you say might be the beginning of a real process of treating cancer we certainly come up with different ways to treat it in our lifetime but that's it's totally different you know my my fiance's grandmother and my fiance's mother both had breast cancer and it's interesting so that's obviously something in their in their gene pool and the treatments that they want just but generationally have improved vastly and so there there's a lot to be encouraged about but obviously we're still a ways away so I wanted to jump in on what Mark was saying because there was a story recently that unfortunately we didn't get to on the show regarding how members of the right right-wing lawmakers were pushing for legislation that would allow people with cancer and other illnesses to opt in to treatments that haven't been approved by the FDA yet so they would be you know trial type situations and I don't know why it is but members of the left aren't necessarily in favor of that and I think part of the reason why these clinical trials begin with mice is because of some of those regulatory restrictions I'm a firm ly believe that as humans we should have complete say over our own bodies and what we do to our own bodies as long as we're not harming anyone else and if someone has a terminal illness or something as serious as cancer I think he or she should have the ability to make a decision as to whether or not they're involved in in certain trials or certain treatments that haven't been approved by the FDA yet now with that said there has already been considerable advancements in cancer treatments in other countries something that isn't talked about a lot here in the United States it's key real in fact there has been some development in treating lung cancer in Cuba and there have been numerous reports about this but I just wanted to show you this quick video to give you a little more insight into this treatment take a look sim effects EGF is a Cuban developed drug aimed at preventing the recurrence of the disease Gomez is now back at work and once a month she returns to the hospital for a series of intramuscular injections my synthoid I feel good I've even gained some weight I've been using the vaccine for two years and four months now and so far I feel really good my Cynthia patience still have to complete a course of chemo or radiotherapy before moving on to the vaccine there are other lung cancer fighting drugs which work by attacking the cancer cells what's different about the vaccine is that it helps the body generate its own immune system in a way that starves the cancer and stops it from growing it has revolutionized lung cancer treatment in our country it's a new therapeutic weapon for treating the disease patients are responding well and surviving for longer than those not being treated with it so you know there again has been some advancements in Cuba and for all of the fear-mongering that you hear in the United States regarding Cuba and how Cubans are living they're still doing an incredible job when it comes to preventative health care and apparently they've shown some improvement when it comes to treating diseases such as cancer as well I can't help but be struck that as we talk about all these different cancer cures and there are breakthroughs and they're great signs that never talked about is the cause of cancer we don't talk enough actually we do talk a bit about it on TYT but these pollutants that we referred to particularly in our one the toxification of the air the water the land and of course the cancer rates are growing and the treatments have to grow with them but if if we can have a little more conversation in this country about the causes of the cancer instead of hey different ways to treat the tumor hey yo my aunt just got cancer right because we're we're swimming we're bathing in these carcinogens every day and it's just a shame that there isn't more talk about those things in our environment that are producing these conditions absolutely and also treatments in other countries I think that's really important to point out yeah I mean I I think that one thing that the US could certainly improve upon is learning from what other countries are doing right and oftentimes that has to do with policy right I mean we very rarely look at things like health policy health care policy in other countries and learn from what they're doing right in fact we'll look at countries that are doing things right and automatically smear it as our politicians do with universal health care and in places like Canada for instance and it's because of the corporate interests that don't want us to have a better system in place but you know what we saw in Cuba with that treatment for lung cancer is kind of similar to what researchers are now looking into here in the United States ways to strengthen and improve the human immune system so it can kind of fight off that cancer and
