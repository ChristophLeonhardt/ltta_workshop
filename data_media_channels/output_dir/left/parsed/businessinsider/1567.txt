what goes in the virgin prayer we cook a
burger we smash it to create this nice
salty crust on the outside that is a
nice counterpoint to the soft interior
for Shake Shack the perfect burger
it all starts out with the meat if the
beat is not great the burgers just gonna
fall flat
so for us we have a proprietary blend of
different cuts that are ground if you
were to cook a burger at home I would
recommend going to your butcher make
them friends and choosing the entire
stake and grinding that we never use any
trimming in our burgers because all the
flavor is in those whole muscles
that's while the beautiful flavor lies
