- Hey everyone, it's
me Hallease back with a
Quick Tech Minute.
So while I've been here in D.C.,
I've been trying out this Manfrotto,
it's kinda like a mini tripod.
Like a table tripod for your camera.
And I've been using it
while here in D.C. to vlog,
and I actually really like it.
I usually use a Gorilla Pod,
I think that's most people use
but I wanted to give this a try.
Some things to know about
this little guy is that
it's very compact compared
to the Gorilla Pods,
and also it's like a mini tripod
so it comes out and extends
as well so you can make
it different heights.
The one downfall I will
say of this product though
is that comparatively, with
a Gorilla Pod you can compare
and make it like,
as wide or as close together
as you want to create
different heights for your camera.
Whereas with this one, you
kinda only have two sort of
preferred heights that
they designed it for.
I have attempted to use it
at sort of different height
lengths depending on
what I was trying to do.
Say if you're trying to
have this on a windowsill to
get a time lapse or something like that.
And you can make it work,
but depending on the weight
of your camera it might be an issue.
So keep that in mind.
But overall, even with
those cons, if you will,
I actually really like this.
Because it's a lot
lighter than a Gorilla Pod
and it actually works
really well for vlogging
and doing what most of us do,
which is talking straight to camera.
So, if you're interested
in purchasing this,
this isn't sponsored, but
if you're interested in
purchasing it, I will
link to it down below
in the comments and that's it.
A Quick Tech Minute.
See you when I see you.
