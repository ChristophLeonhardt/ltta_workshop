THE COMMAND AND CONTROL OF THE 
RESPECTIVE GOVERNOR.  
SECRETARY MATUS RECENTLY 
APPROVED DUAL STATUS COMMANDERS 
 
CAROLINA, NORTH CAROLINA, AND 
VIRGINIA.  
GENERAL O'SHAUGHNESSY HAS A 
ROBUST TEAM AT FEMA HEADQUARTERS
IN FORWARD DEPLOYED WITH EACH 
OF THE FEMA REGIONS TO OPERATE 
TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  
HE WILL NOW PROVIDE AN UPDATE 
ON THE OPERATIONAL ACTIONS 
TAKEN TO PREPARE FOR HURRICANE 
FLORENC.  
THANK YOU.  
>> THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESS CORPS FOR YOUR ONGOING 
EFFORTS TO INFORM THE PUBLIC 
ROLE THAT IS ESPECIALLY 
IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF THE 
DANGER THAT HURRICANES AND 
OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS POSE.  
FEMA ADMINISTRATOR BROCK LONG 
SAID THAT THE EMERGENCY 
RESPONSE AND RECOVERY IS A 
WHOLE COMMUNITY EFFORT.  
I CANNOT AGREE MORE.  
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS WALK 
INTO THE DOD RESPONSE AND THE 
EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE ONGOING ON 
THE LOCAL LEVEL, STATE-LEVEL, 
AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL.  
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT 
MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ARE 
ALSO MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES 
THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS THE 
STORM.  
NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, 
VIRGINIA, AND GEORGIA ARE ALL 
HOME TO WELL-KNOWN LITERARY 
BASES AND INSTALLATIONS.  
THE SECRETARY DEFENSE HAS GIVEN 
AUTHORITY FOR LIFE SUSTAINING 
ACIONS TO MAKE DOT -- DOD 
CAPABILITIES IMMEDIATELY 
AVAILABLE IN LOCAL COMMANDERS 
ARE PROACTIVELY POSITIONING 
FORCES AND EQUIPMENT TO BE 
READY.  
AT THE STATE LEVEL NATIONAL 
GUARD UNITS WHETHER ARMY OR AIR 
UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR 
GOVERNORS ARE READY TO RESPOND 
TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND OFTEN 
TIMES NEIGHBORING STATES NEEDS. 
WE ARE CLOSELY LINKED AND 
SYNCED WITH THEM THROUGH FEMA 
AND OTHER EMERGENCY 
COORDINATION NETWORKS TO ENSURE 
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE 
GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES AND 
REQUIREMENTS IN HOW WE, THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, CAN 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL EVER. 
I HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE 
COMMUNICATION WITH EACH OF THE 
STATE ADJUTANT GENERAL'S WHO 
WORK DIRECTLY FOR THE GOVERNORS 
WE ARE ALSO TIED TO THE 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CENTERS 
WITHIN EACH STATE.  
WE ARE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE A 
ROBUST RESPONSE FOR BOTH TITLE 
X WERE ACTIVE DUTY AND TITLE 
32, THE NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL
. THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS 
ACTIVATED DUAL STATUS 
COMMANDERS IN NORTH CAROLINA, 
SOUTH CAROLINA, AND VIRGINIA TO 
PROVIDE SEAMLESS COMMAND AND 
CONTROL OVER ASSIGNED ACTIVE 
GUARD AND RESPONSE FORCES.  
FINALLY, I HAVE CONSTANT 
DIALOGUE WITH THE CHIEF OF THE 
NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU TO ENSURE 
THEIR EFFORTS ARE SEAMLESS.  
ALONG WITH FEMA STATE GOVERNORS 
IN THE NATIONAL GUARD DOD IS 
RESPONDING ROBUSTLY.  
THE NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDERS 
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND 
UNDERSTANDING TO LEAD OUR 
FORCES FOR THIS KIND OF MISSION 
THEY HAVE MY COMPLETE 
CONFIDENCE AND SUPPORT WHILE I 
CAN ATTEST TO THE TREMENDOUS 
CAPABILITY THAT RESIDES WITHIN 
THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL BASED 
ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS THE 
STORM DOT'S PROACTIVE ACTIONS 
ARE ENSURING OUR FORCES ARE 
OPTIMALLY POSITIONED FOR 
IMMEDIATE RELEASE MONTHS.  
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ME SAFE 
WARMLY THAT HOMELAND DEFENSE IS 
A NORMAL DOSE NUMBER ONE 
PRIORITY FOR NORAD BUT WE AT 
THE REST OF DOD ARE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO PROVIDING THE TERRY 
DIFFICULTIES IN SUPPORT OF FEMA 
AND STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS 
WHILE STILL DEFENDING THE 
HOMELAND.  
IT IS AN CAPABILITY SET MAKE 
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES SO 
POWERFULLY IN COMBAT LEND 
HIMSELF EXTRAORDINARILY WELL TO 
DISASTER RELIEF.  
WE ARE READY AND ABLE TO 
SUPPORT FEMA AND STATE AND 
LOCAL OFFICIALS IN SITUATIONS 
WHERE UNIQUE CAPABILITIES ARE 
REQUIRED TO ASSIST OUR 
COMMUNITIES.  
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOU A 
SNAPSHOT OF HOW WE ARE 
PROACTIVELY POSITIONING FORCES 
TO RESPOND FROM THE NORTH, 
SOUTH, EAST, WEST ACROSS THE 
FULL SPECTRUM OF DOD 
CAPABILITIES AT EVERY LEVEL BY 
AIR, SEA, AND BY LAND.  
THE DOD IS PROVIDING FEMA THE 
FOLLOWING MILITARY INSTALLATIONS
AT STAGING AREAS FOR RELIEF 
COMMODITIES.  
FORT AP HILL VIRGINIA, JOINT 
BASE BRAGG NORTH CAROLINA, A 
THICK SILVERY AIRFIELD SOUTH 
CAROLINA, MAXWELL AIR FORCE 
BASE IN NORTH CAROLINA.  
AT FORT STEWART GEORGE AND 
MOVING FORWARD FROM FORT 
CAMPBELL KENTUCKY WE HAVE 
MULTIPLE COMPOSITE TRUCK 
COMPANIES OF APPROXIMATELY 80 
LIGHT TO MEDIUM TACTICAL 
VEHICLES, EACH STAGE TO TO 
RESPOND QUICKLY ONCE FLORENCE 
PASSES THROUGH THE AREA.  
THERE HIGH WATER CLEARANCE 
VEHICLES WHICH CAN CARRY 
SUPPLIES TO FIRST RESPONDER 
TWO HIG WATER AREAS NOT 
ACCESSIBLE BY TYPICAL FIRST 
RESPONDER VEHICLES IN ORDER TO 
RESCUE TRAPPED INDIVIDUALS OR 
PERFORM HOUSE TO HOUSE CHECKS 
THIS CAPABILITY WAS USED TO 
GREAT EFFECT DURING HURRICANE 
HARVEY OPERATIONS LAST YEAR.  
AT HUNTER ARMY AIRFIELD DOD HAS 
APPROXIMATELY 35 HELICOPTERS 
THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR SEARCH 
AND RESCUE OPERATIONS.  
IS A UNIT IS AT FORT BLISS 
TEXAS READY TO MOVE FORWARD.  
AT FORT BRAGG NORTH CAROLINA IN 
ADDITION TO ACTING AS A STAGING
AREA FOR RELIEF SUPPLIES 40 
HIGH WHEELED VEHICLES FOR 
RESCUING TRANSPORTATION AS WELL 
AS SEVEN HELICOPTERS ARE STAGED 
WITHIN A HURRICANE REINFORCED 
HANGER FOR USE WITH SAR AND 
RECOVERY MISSIONS.  
USS CORSAGE IN ARLINGTON WHICH 
WILL LITERALLY CHASE FLORENCE 
AND HAS NAVY AND MARINE 
PERSONNEL IN ADDITION TO LIFE-
SAVING ASSETS TO INCLUDE 16 
HELICOPTERS AND SIX MV 22'S.  
AT MOODY AIR FORCE BASE GEORGIA 
WE HAVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE 
SEARCH AND RESCUE PACKAGE WITH 
SIX HH 60s, TO HC 30s, AND MATT 
PEARL RESCUE TEAMS READY AND 
ABLE TO ASSIST IN SEARCH AND 
RESCUE AS THEY ARE REQUESTED.  
WELL TO HAVE ADDITIONAL SEARCH 
AND RESCUE TEAMS AT MOODY THEY 
CAME FROM PATRICK AIRPORTS -- 
PATRICK AIR FORCE BASE IN 
FLORIDA.  
FIRST AIR FORCE WILL PROVIDE 
ROBUST COMMAND AND CONTROL, 
ERROR OPERATION SUPPORT, AS 
WELL AS ASSISTING VITAL SEARCH 
AND RESCUE EFFORTS TO INCLUDE 
AIRBORNE C2 ASSET SUCH AS A 
JOINT STARS I-8 UNDER NORTH, 
AUTHORITY.  
WE HAVE QUITE LITERALLY 
SURROUNDED THE EXPECTED 
AFFECTED AREA WITH DOD 
CAPABILITY THAT WILL BE CRITICAL
IN HOURS AND DAYS FOLLOWING THE 
STORM'S IMPACT.  
I HAVE SHOWN YOU THE ROBUST 
CAPACITY DOD HAS TO HER SPORT 
-- HAS TO SPOT IMMEDIATELY.  
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPHIC AND 
WE LOOK FROM THE CORSAGE IN 
ARLINGTON THAT WILL FOLLOW THE 
STORM IN WITH A GREAT SUPPORT 
THAT WE HAVE WITH VEHICLES THAT 
WILL BE ABLE TO BE USED IN A 
HIGH WATER SITUATION TO THE 
HELICOPTERS AND ALL THE WAY 
LITERALLY SURROUNDING THIS 
AFFECTED AREA THERE DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE IS READY TO RESPOND 
WHEN ASKED FROM FEMA, THE 
GOVERNORS, THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES
.  WE ARE READY TO RESPOND AND 
WE ARE GOING TO BE READY FOR 
THE FIRST MINUTES AND HOURS 
FOLLOWING FLORENCE IS IMPACT.  
THANK YOU.  
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  
LENA BELTRE, ASSOCIATED PRESS. 
>>  A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.  
SPECIFICALLY, YOU TALKED ABOUT 
THE CORSAGE AND THE ARLINGTON.  
ABOUT HOW SOON DO YOU ESTIMATE 
THOSE TWO SHIPS WILL BE 
ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET TO THE 
AFFECTED AREA CONSIDERING THE 
SLOW PACE OF THE STORM?  AND 
THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. 
>>  LITERALLY, THEY ARE 
DEPENDENT ON THE STORMS TRACK.  
THEY ARE LITERALLY FOLLOWING 
THE STORM IN.  
AS THE STORM PROGRESSES THEY 
PROGRESS IN.  
THERE DEPENDENT ON THE WEATHER 
CONDITIONS TO CLEAR TO BE ABLE 
TO COME IN.  
THAT'S WHY WE ARE NOT LOOKING 
AT THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY TO 
COME FROM THE SEA BUT WE HAVE 
SURROUNDED IT FROM THE LAND AS 
WELL SO WE CAN TAKE A BEFORE 
THE STORM GETS THERE . THE 
AIRCRAFT THAT WE HAVE AND THE 
MIRACLE OF THAT WE HAVE COMING 
FROM THE SOUTH AND WEST AND 
NORTH.  
WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT.  
AS THE STORM CLEARS WE MAY DOSE 
WE WILL GET THE CORSAGE AND 
ARLINGTON AND PICKS UP WHAT YOU 
SEE AS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE AS 
YOU LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF THE 
STORM AND, SPECIFICALLY, ONE OF 
THE ISSUES THAT HAS COME UP IN 
PREVIOUS STORMS AND OTHER 
DISASTERS IS THIS DOD WAITING 
FOR STATES TO ASK FOR SOMETHING 
THAT THE MILITARY KNOWS THEY 
SHOULD BE ASKING FOR AND THEY 
ARE NOT ASKING FOR IT YET WERE 
ASKING FOR IT QUICKLY ENOUGH.  
HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSING WHAT HAS 
BEEN A PERPETUAL PROBLEM?  
>> FIRST, I WAS A SECRETARY 
MATUS GUIDANCE TO ME IS CLEAR.  
WE ARE ANTICIPATING THE NEEDS 
AND MOVING FORWARD UNDER OUR 
OWN AUTHORITIES TO BE ABLE TO 
RESPOND AS SOON AS THAT REQUEST 
IS MADE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE 
TO GENERATE A FORCE ONCE THE 
REQUEST IS MADE.  
THAT FORCE IS IMMEDIATELY 
AVAILABLE.  
AS WE LOOK INTO THE STORM AND 
WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH 
BROCK LONG AS HE LOOKS AT WHAT 
HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGES WILL BE 
IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF 
THE STORMS LANDED WE THINK THE 
SEARCH AND RESCUE, THE VERTICAL 
LIFT, AND THE ABILITY TO BRING 
IN THE HELICOPTERS IS GOING TO 
BE A KEY ASSET.  
IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH 
ADMINISTRATOR BROCK LONG. 
>>  SO SEARCH AND RESCUE IS 
GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST 
CHALLENGE.  
IS THAT LIKE ALONG THE WATER'S 
EDGE?  
>> I THINK BECAUSE AS WE SEE 
THE STORM COMING IN, EVEN 
THOUGH IT HAS DEGRADED TO A 
CATEGORY TWO, BECAUSE OF THE 
LENGTH OF TIME IT WILL BE ON 
THE COAST AND THE HEAVY RAINFALL
THAT WILL HAPPEN WE DO THINK 
THE FLOODING AND STORM SURGE 
COMBINATION TOGETHER WILL BE 
VERY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME . 
THE SEARCH AND RESCUE IS 
PROBABLY THE FIRST AND FOREMOST 
RESPONSE THAT WE WOULD BE 
LOOKING AT BUT IT'S NOT THE 
ONLY RESPONSE.  
IT WILL BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT 
TO HAVE THOSE ASSETS AVAILABLE. 
NOT ON A GENERATION AND 24 
HOURS BUT IMMEDIATELY 
AVAILABLE.  
THAT'S WHY UNDER SECRETARY 
MATUS IS AUTHORITY WE WERE ABLE 
TO PUSH THOSE FORWARD AND HAVE 
THEM READY FOR IMMEDIATE 
RESPONSE.  
>> TERRA-COTTA, MILITARY TIMES. 
>>  THANK YOU PICK BETWEEN ALL 
OF THE AIR, LAND, AND IS THE 
ASSETS THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE 
ABOUT HOW MANY PERSONNEL TOTAL 
ARE INVOLVED IN THIS RESPONSE?  
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.  
AT THIS MOMENT TO THE RAPIDLY 
CHANGING NUMBER.  
AT THIS MOMENT WE HAVE 
APPROXIMATELY 7000 PERSONNEL, 
UST OVER 4000 IS NATIONAL 
GUARD AND ABOUT 3000 ACTIVE-
DUTY THAT NUMBER WILL CHANGE 
AND FLUCTUATE DRASTICALLY OVER 
THE UPCOMING HOURS.  
WE WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU 
INFORMED AS THAT NUMBER GOES 
THROUGH OUR PRESS RELEASES.  
>> WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME 
FROM FOR THOSE RESPONSES?  
THE BUCKET THAT YOU'RE PULLING 
FROM OR WHERE DOES IT COME 
FROM?  
>> THE STAFFORD ACT IS THE 
LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
WITH DISASTER RELIEF FUNDS.  
FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR FEDERAL 
MISSIONS SUPPORTING STATE AND 
LOCALS IN AN EMERGENCY LIKE THAT
ARE PAID VIA STAFFORD ACT. 
>>  LOOKING AT THIS TREMENDOUS 
PRE-POITIONED RESPONSE YOU 
CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF ORDER 
EICHEL -- PUERTO RICO WHERE IT 
TOOK DAYS FOR SHIPS TO GET 
THERE.  
THAT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF 
HAVING TO ASK FOR IT.  
WHAT SORT OF LESSONS HAVE BEEN 
LEARNED AS FAR AS RESPONDING 
AND HELP AMERICAN CITIZENS 
BECAUSE 
>> WE DID A DETAILED LESSON 
LEARNED PROCESS AS WE DO POST 
ANY SIGNIFICANT EVENT IN THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.  WHAT WE 
GOT OUT OF THAT ASSESSMENT IS 
WE HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE, FOR 
EXAMPLE, TO DEVELOP A COMMON 
OPERATIONAL PICTURE THAT WE 
SHARE WITH ALL DOD ENTITIES AND 
OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS.  
WE HAVE A COMMON ASKING 
PICTURE, WHICH IS THE REQUEST 
THAT WE ARE GETTING OR BELIEVE 
THAT WE WILL BE GETTING FROM 
OTHER PARTNERS.  AND THEN WE 
HAVE A COMMON TASKING PICTURE.  
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT ASSETS FROM 
ONE ENTITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT
ARE BEING SENT TO SUPPORT THE 
RESPONSE TO THE STORM.  
WE HAVE HAD THAT IN PLACE.  
WE HAVE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT 
IMPROVE IT'S TO THAT.  JUST 
BASED ON THOSE THREE STORMS 
THAT WERE OVERLAPPING, 
LITERALLY, CREATING A LEVEL OF 
INTENSITY AND DEPLETION OF 
RESOURCES THAT WAS REALLY 
UNPRECEDENTED.  
>> I WAS A THE CLOSE 
COLLABORATION THAT WE HAVE 
ESTABLISHED BETWEEN FEMA AND 
THE GOVERNORS IS ALLOWING US TO 
POPULATE THOSE DATABASES, WE 
FULLY UNDERSTAND THE 
REQUIREMENTS, THE NEEDS EVEN 
BEFORE THE FORMAL PROCESSING 
HAS BEEN COMPLETED.  
I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP WE 
HAVE RIGHT NOW IS AS STRONG AS 
IT IS EVER BEEN BETWEEN THE 
FEDERAL FORCES, THE LOCAL, 
STATE FORCES, AND, OF COURSE, 
FEMA AND THE ADMINISTRATOR 
BROCK LONG. 
>>  LEIGH MARTINEZ, ABC. 
>>  A QUESTION ABOUT PRE-
POSITIONING.  
I BELIEVE DURING HER CAME IRMA 
WHICH WAS IN FLORIDA POSITIONED 
A LOT OF ASSETS OUTSIDE THE 
STORM AREA.  
LATER ON THEY WERE NEEDED AT 
ALL BECAUSE THE STATE ASSETS 
COULD HANDLE IT.  
AS WE LOOK AT THE STORM DO YOU 
FORESEE THAT THE GUARD WILL BE 
ABLE TO HANDLE SAR IMMEDIATELY 
AFTER THE STORM AND MAY NOT 
EVEN REQUIRE YOUR ASSETS?  
>> ALL THE LOCAL NATIONAL GUARD 
THE SEARCH AND RESCUE 
REQUIREMENT THAT THE MAGNITUDE 
OF THIS STORE MAY EXCEED THEIR 
CAPABILITY AND IF IT DOES WE 
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 
POSTURED AND READY TO RESPOND 
AT A MOMENTS NOTICE TO THAT.  
IF WE END UP WITH THIS FORCE 
THAT WE HAVE THAT IS NOT NEEDED 
BECAUSE EITHER THE STORM 
DOESN'T HAVE THE IMPACT THAT WE 
THINK IT MIGHT AND OR THE LOCAL 
RESPONDERS AND THE NATIONAL 
GUARD UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S 
AUTHORITIES CAN HANDLE IT THAT 
IS JUST FINE.  
THEN WE HAVE MET OUR MISSION.  
>> ALSO, WITH HURRICANE MARIA 
IN PUERTO RICO, OBVIOUSLY, THE 
ELECTRICAL GRID WAS IMPACTED IN 
A HUGE WAY.  
THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
PREDICTIONS THAT MAY BE THREE 
QUARTERS OF SOME OF THESE 
STATES MAY LOSE POWER FOR WEEKS
.  WHAT KIND OF A ROLE CAN YOU 
PLAY IN THAT?  SPECIFICALLY THE 
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS.  WHAT 
CAN YOU DO TO HELP THEM IN THIS 
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH?  
>> JUST ESHELMAN, THE ARMY 
CORPS OF ENGINEERS WILL BE -- 
JUST AS YOU MENTIONED, THE ARMY 
CORPS OF ENGINEERS WILL BE DEEP 
IN THAT REGARD.  úWE SYNCHRONIZ 
WE WERE CLOSELY WITH FEMA AND 
THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SO WE CAN 
ANTICIPATE THOSE.  
THE STAGING AREAS WE HAVE RIGHT 
NOW ARE FULL OF THE GENERATORS 
THAT YOU MENTIONED SO WE CAN 
RESPOND AND PUSH THOSE FORWARD. 
IT IS THE COLLABORATION AND 
CLOSE WORKING, IT IS BRINGING 
ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OFFENSE -- THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO BEAR 
AGAINST THIS CHALLENGING 
PROBLEMS THAT. 
>>  I WOULD NOTE THAT ONE OF 
THE BENEFITS THAT YOU GET FROM 
A DISASTER ON THE MAINLAND 
WHERE YOU HAVE MULTIPLE 
CONTIGUOUS STATES IS A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROXIMITY 
THAT STATES WILL PROVIDE IN 
THEIR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM CONTEXT.  
THERE ARE ELECTRICAL REPAIR 
VEHICLES HEADING TOWARD THE 
SOUTHEAST COAST FROM ALL OVER 
THE COUNTRY AS WE SPEAK . THE 
MASSING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF 
WHERE THE HURRICANE WILL HAVE 
THE MOST IMPACT READY TO GO IN. 
IF THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT TO 
MEET THE NEED THEN THE STATES 
WILL MAKE A REQUEST OF A FEMA 
AND DOD WILL BE THERE WITH ASSET
AS REQUESTED BY THEM TO MEET 
THE NEED.  
>> SERVI, AFP. 
>>  DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW 
MANY PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM 
THE COASTAL AREA?  
>> I HEARD THE FIGURE OF OVER 1 
MILLION TODAY.  
THAT WAS PROBABLY AS OF EARLIER 
TODAY.  
WE DON'T HAVE THOSE STATISTICS. 
>> I WOULD DIRECT YOU TO FEMA 
FOR THE DIRECT ANSWER.  
>> TOM TERRY, TALK MEDIANEWS. 
>>  I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION.  
I WAS JUST SCRATCHING MY HEAD. 
>>  OKAY.  
 
>> LUCAS THOMASON, FOX NEWS.  
>> WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU 
DOING DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR 
COMPARED TO LAST YEAR?  
WITH HURRICANES?  
>>) I THINK AS WAS MENTIONED, 
WE TAKE THE LESSONS LEARNED 
FROM LAST YEAR IT WAS A 
PHENOMENAL ROBUST RESPONSE BUT 
WE CAN ALWAYS LEARN FROM THAT.  
I THINK THE ANTICIPATION, THE 
COORDINATION AHEAD OF TIME, THE 
COLLABORATION OF REALLY 
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE REQUESTS 
ARE GOING TO BE AND IN A MANNER 
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PREDICT 
TO . THE POSITION OUR FORCES 
HAS SET US UP FOR SUCCESS FOR 
POINTS. 
>>  NOTHING SPECIFIC YOU ARE 
DOING DIFFERENT THIS YEAR?  
>> THERE ARE MULTIPLE THINGS WE 
ARE DOING DIFFERENT IN HOW WE 
ARE WE ARE -- ON HOW WE ARE 
PROCESSING IT SO THAT WE CAN DO 
SO QUICKER.  
IT'S NOT ONE THING, IT IS A 
MULTIPLE THINGS WE ARE DOING IN 
ORDER TO DRIVE THAT TIME FROM 
REQUEST TO ACTUAL RESPONSE AND 
ACTION THAT I THINK WILL SET US 
UP FOR SUCCESS FOR THIS EVENT.  
>> CARL BABB, VOICE OF AMERICA. 
>>  THANK YOU.  
TWO QUESTIONS.  FIRST, WE HAVE 
LEARNED ABOUT SOME OF THE SHIPS 
THAT HAVE BEEN SWORD TEED OUT.  
WHAT OTHER EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN 
MOVED OUT OF THE AREA, PLAINS 
AND OTHER THINGS.  ABOUT HOW 
MUCH HAS THAT CAUSED TO MOVE 
THAT EQUIPMENT OUT FOR THE 
MILITARY?  MY SECOND QUESTION IS
ON THE SEARCH AND RESCUE TIMING
.  EVERY TIME THERE IS A 
HURRICANE, ESPECIALL IN THE 
CAROLINAS, THERE ARE PEOPLE ON 
THE OUTER BANKS THAT DO NOT 
LIKE TO LEAVE BECAUSE THERE'S 
ONLY ONE ROAD AND I FEEL LIKE 
IF THEY STAY THEY DON'T HAVE TO 
WORRY ABOUT TAKING A DAY TO GET 
BACK.  
CAN YOU TELL US HOW LONG YOU 
ANTICIPATE IT WILL TAKE TO GET 
TO PEOPLE IF THEY BECOME, GET 
INTO A DIRE SITUATION?  
>> FIRST, LET ME START, ALL OF 
THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE CITIZENS
SHOULD LISTEN TO THEIR 
APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT LISTEN 
TO THE GUIDANCE THEY HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN IN RESPECT TO 
EVACUATIONS.  
THIS PARTICULAR STORM WILL BE 
CHALLENGING IN REGARDS OF WHAT 
YOU MENTIONED.  
BECAUSE OF THE SLOW-MOVING 
NATURE OF THE STORM IT COULD 
VERY WELL STAY WITH HIGH WIND, 
INCLEMENT WEATHER FOR A LONG 
TIME.  THAT WILL ME THAT ANY 
RESCUE EFFORT IS GOING TO TAKE 
TIME.  
WE STILL HAVE THE LIMITATIONS 
THAT WE HAVE OF OPERATING WITHIN
THOSE WEATHER ENVIRONMENTS THAT 
WILL PRECLUDE US FROM 
NECESSARILY COMING IN IN THE 
HOURS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 
STORM HITS.  AGAIN, I WOULD 
REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED 
BASED ON THE NATURE OF THIS 
PARTICULAR STORM TO HEED THE 
EVACUATION RECOMMENDATIONS.  
WITH RESPECT -- IT IS WEATHER 
DEPENDENT.  
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT PART IS 
UNDER -- OUT OF OUR CONTROL.  
AS SOON AS THE WEATHER ALLOWS 
US TO WE WILL BE ABLE TO 
RESPOND VERY QUICKLY.  
WITH RESPECT TO THE MOVEMENT OF 
THE FORCE, OF COURSE, WE HAVE 
TO MOVE THE FORCE TO PRESERVE 
THE FORCE.  
IT IS PRUDENT FOR US TO DO SO.  
I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT COST OF 
WHAT THAT IS.  
WE CAN GIVE YOU A FOLLOW-UP 
ANSWER ON THAT.  
OBVIOUSLY, IT IS PRUDENT FOR US 
TO MOVE IT AS OPPOSED TO HAVE 
IT DAMAGED BY THE STORM.  
>> TOM BOWMAN, NPR. 
>>  THE MARINES HAVE APPARENTLY 
DECIDED TO STAY AT CAMP LEJEUNE 
AND WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THIS STORM SURGE.  
ARE THE PART OF THE RESCUE 
EFFORT OR WILL THEY HAVE TO 
FIND THEIR OWN WAY OUT IF 
THINGS GET REALLY BAD?  
TWO, IN A SENSE OF GETTING THE 
HOSPITAL SHIP COMFORT UNDERWAY 
AND HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE IT 
NECESSARY?  
>> FIRST, WE HAVE TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE IN OUR INSTALLATION 
COMMANDERS AND THE DECISIONS 
THEY MAKE RELATIVE TO 
EVACUATION OR NOT EVACUATION.  
WE HAVE FAITH THAT IS THE RIGHT 
DECISION TO MAKE.  WE WILL 
STANDBY READY TO SUPPORT THEM.  
ON A POSITIVE SIDE, BECAUSE OF 
THEIR PROXIMITY AND THEIR GREAT 
CAPABILITY THAT WILL ALSO BE 
PART OF THE RELIEF EFFORTS THAT 
WE CAN BRING TO BEAR VERY 
QUICKLY.  
THEY WILL HELP IN THE EFFORT AS 
WELL.  
WE ARE FULLY COORDINATED WITH 
HIM.  
WE UNDERSTAND THE CAPABILITY 
CAPACITY THAT THEY HAVE AND WE 
ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO FIND 
WHEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BE 
PART OF THAT RESPONSE.  
>> I JUST HAD A NOTE FOR THAT.  
ALL DOD INSTALLATION COMMANDERS 
HAVE WHAT WE CALL IMMEDIATE 
RESPONSE AUTHORITIES.  
IF THERE ARE LIFE-THREATENING 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE VICINITY, 
IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY ARE 
IN THEY HAVE PREAUTHORIZATION 
TO PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO 
THAT.  AND NUMBER OF THESE 
INSTALLATIONS ALSO HAVE MUTUAL 
AID AGREEMENTS WITH STATE AND 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  
THAT JUST MAKES MORE CLEAR AND 
THEY HAVE DONE SOME PREPLANNING 
ABOUT THE TYPES OF CAPABILITIES 
THAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE.  
AGAIN, IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE 
THERE ARE THREATS TO THE 
COMMUNITY. 
>>  I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT THE 
FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE 
AMAZING WORK THAT THEY HAVE 
DONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO IN 
THIS EFFORT.  
OF COURSE, WE WANT TO MARRY UP 
WITH THEM AND BE SUPPORTIVE OF 
THEM.  SPECIFIC TO YOUR 
QUESTION ON THE COMFORT, WE 
HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE COORDINATION 
WITH FEMA AS WELL AS THE 
GOERNOR'S AND THE LOCAL STATE 
AUTHORITIES AT THIS TIME WE 
JUST DON'T THINK THAT CAPABILITY
IS NEEDED AT THIS TIME BASED ON 
THE ROBUST CAPABILITY WE HAVE 
IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES 
FOR MEDICAL SUPPORT.  
>> HOPE, PLEASE IDENTIFY YOUR 
OUTLET. 
>>  MILITARY.COM.  
TOM TOOK MY QUESTION BUT I 
GUESS I WILL FOLLOW UP.  
SO, YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE 
THE INSTRUCTION OF THE CIVILIAN 
AUTHORITIES AND THE MILITARY 
AUTHORITIES IS IN DIRECT 
CONTRADICTION AND THERE'S A LOT 
OF ANGST COMING OUT OF THAT.  
IN GENERAL, WITH THAT DECISION 
MADE BY THE BASE COMMANDER IN 
COLLABORATION OR COORDINATION 
WITH WORTH CON IS THERE CONCERN 
ABOUT THE MIXED MESSAGES WHERE 
THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES ARE 
SAYING TO GET OUT AND THE 
MILITARY IS INTERESTING TO SAY 
-- TUESDAY?  
>> THE DECISION WAS MADE AT THE 
INSTALLATION LEVEL WE SUPPORT 
THE DECISION OF OUR LOCAL 
INSTALLATION COMMANDERS.  
JEFF, TASK AND PURPOSE. 
>>  THANK YOU.  
GENERAL, CAN YOU SAY HOW MANY 
MARINES ARE BARRED THE CURE 
SARS AND THE ARLINGTON?  
>> I CAN GET YOU THE SPECIFIC 
NUMBERS OF MARINES ON BOARD.  
IS A LIGHT SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ON 
BOARD.  
THIS IS A ROBUST CAPABILITY AND 
CAPACITY AND IT WILL BE WELL-
SUITED FOR THEY HAVE VERTICAL 
LIFT AND A LOT OF CAPACITY TO 
BRING ON BOARD.  
THIS IS ROBUST CAPABILITY AND 
CAPACITY THAT WILL COME TO BEAR 
IF REQUIRED AND FOLLOWING RIGHT 
IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE STORM 
COMING IN. 
>>  ARE ALL THE PERIL RESCUE 
UNITS ALSO SPECIAL OPERATIONS?  
>> THEY ARE NOT ALL SPECIAL 
OPERATIONS.  
WE HAVE ALL OF THE SERVICES 
THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE 
PERIL RESCUE AND RESCUE 
OPERATORS AVAILABLE FOR US.  
>> THANK YOU.  
>> PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND 
OUTLET. 
>>  BRIAN EVERSON, AIR FORCE 
MAGAZINE.  
YOU MENTIONED PERIL RESCUE 
STANDING BY AT MOODY.  THERE 
ARE SOME TEAMS COMING IN FROM 
NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA, AND 
ALASKA AT DOVER.  
ARE THEY BEING FORWARDED TO ANY 
OTHER LOCATIONS?  
CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT 
OTHER FORCES YOU HAVE STANDING 
BY OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE 
AREA?  
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD 
TALK TO IS WHAT WE CALL OUR 
SECOND ECHELON FORCES.  
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS WE 
HAVE THIS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE 
CAPABILITY THAT WE KNOW WE 
NEED.  
WE ALSO WANT TO BALANCE THAT 
WITH NOT PUTTING ADDITIONAL 
PEOPLE AT RISK WITHIN THE 
AFFECTED AREA.  
WE HAVE ALSO PUT, BESIDES THOSE 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HERE, WE 
PUT PEOPLE IN WHAT WE CALL A PT 
DEAL, PREPARE TO DEPLOY ORDER.  
NORMALLY ABOUT A 24-HOUR STRING 
WE HAVE THE MONT TO RESPOND.  
WE HAVE THEM ALL OVER THE 
NATION READY TO RESPOND WITH 
THE FULL CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY 
HERE.  
THIS IS A BIT OF A MICROCOSM OF 
THAT IN THE SENSE THAT THIS IS 
FORCES WE HAVE THAT WE ARE 
BRINGING FORWARD.  
THESE ARE GUARD FORCES BROUGHT 
FORWARD UNDER THE AGREEMENTS 
BETWEEN THE STATES TO BRING 
THAT CAPABILITY FORWARD THAT WE 
KNOW WE HAVE GREAT RESCUE 
CAPABILITY WITHIN THOSE THREE 
UNITS. 
>>  SO THEY ARE US STAYING OVER 
FOR NOW?  
>> FOR NOW BUT THEY WILL BE 
MOVED FORWARD. 
>>  RYAN BROWN, CNN. 
>>  YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
PRESERVING THE FORCE AND THE 
NEED TO MOVE CERTAIN ASSETS OUT 
OF THE AREA.  
YOU HAVE AN OVERALL IDEA OF HOW 
MANY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN AND 
HOW MUCH HAS BEEN RELOCATED?  
>> WE CAN GET THAT NUMBER FOR 
YOU.  
IT WILL BE A MOVING TARGET IN 
THE SINCE THERE ARE SOME THAT 
MOVED OUT EARLY AND SOME THAT 
ARE CONTINUING TO MOVE OUT NOW. 
WE WILL ALSO BE BRINGING THEM 
BACK IN A STAIRSTEP MANNER.  
WE CAN CONTINUALLY UPDATE OF 
THAT MOVEMENT AND THE NUMBER 
THAT WILL BE OVERTIME AND 
CONTINUING TO CHANGE.  
>> COURTNEY KEEP IT, NBC.  
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE 
PREPARE TO DEPLOY ORDER RIGHT 
NOW?  
>> THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND 
UNITS ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE . THE IS 
ACROSS ALL SERVICES.  
THE ARMY, NAVY, AIR FORCE, 
MARINES ARE ALL CONTRIBUTING TO 
THAT FORCE.  
THE INDIVIDUAL UNITS HAVE BEEN 
SOURCED IN THE SENSE THAT THEY 
KNOW THEY ARE ON THAT PT D.O. 
AND THEY ARE PREPARED TO 
RESPOND. 
>>  WHAT DO YOU THINK, ONCE THE 
STORM HITS WHAT YOU THINK IS 
GOING TO BE THE FIRST MILITARY 
ASSETS THAT START RESPONDING?  
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 
HELICOPTERS AND THINGS OUT THE 
SHIPS BECAUSE THEY'RE COMING IN 
BEHIND IT SO THE WEATHER -- ARE 
WE TALKING LAND VEHICLES 
DRIVING UP?  
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE 
BOTH THE HELICOPTERS AND THE 
LAND VEHICLES COMING FROM THE 
SOUTH AND THE WEST AND THE 
NORTH.  
THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST 
RESPONDERS.  DEPENDING ON HOW 
THE STORM TRACKS.  
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET IN 
BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER
