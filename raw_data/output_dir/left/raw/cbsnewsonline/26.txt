WATCHED POLITICIANS ESCALATE 

189
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,271
POLITICAL ATTACKS ON OUR 

190
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:12,871
COURAGEOUS POLICE OFFICERS. 

191
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:14,941
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN IT MORE 

192
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:20,446
THAN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. 

193
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:20,846
IT'S DISGRACEFUL. 

194
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:21,580
POLITICIANS WHO SPREAD THIS 

195
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,715
DANGEROUS ANTI-POLICE SENTIMENT 

196
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:29,155
MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR CRIMINALS, 

197
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,724
AND MORE DANGEROUS FOR LAW-

198
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,192
ABIDING CITIZENS. 

199
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,696
[APPLAUSE] 

200
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,333
AND THEY ALSO MAKE IT MORE 

201
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:40,866
DANGEROUS FOR POLICE. 

202
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:49,542
AND IT MUST STOP, AND IT MUST 

203
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,843
STOP NOW. 

204
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,145
BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE LESS THAN 

205
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:55,948
TWO YEARS AGO, OUR NATION WAS 

206
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:01,888
EXPERIENCING A HISTORIC SURGE 

207
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:02,321
IN VIOLENT CRIME. 

208
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,091
IN 2015, 2016, ADDITIONAL 

209
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,292
128,000 VIOLENT CRIMES WERE 

210
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,727
COMMITTED NATIONWIDE COMPARED 

211
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:12,798
TO THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS. 

212
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:14,100
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF 

213
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,800
ADDITIONAL CRIME. 

214
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,969
OVER THE SAME PERIOD, WE 

215
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,872
WITNESSED THE STEEPEST TWO YEAR 

216
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,373
CONSECUTIVE INCREASE IN MURDERS 

217
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,809
IN NEARLY HALF A CENTURY. 

218
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,511
BUT WE ARE TURNING THAT TIDE 

219
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,580
AROUND VERY RAPIDLY, AS YOU ALL 

220
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,749
KNOW IN THIS ROOM. 

221
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,385
WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR STREETS 

222
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,418
FROM DRUG LORDS, GANGS, AND 

223
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:33,652
CRIMES. 

224
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:35,554
WE ARE BEING TOUGH. 

225
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:36,956
WE'RE BEING SMART. 

226
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,226
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR MURDERS 

227
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,562
IN MAJOR CITIES ARE ESTIMATED 

228
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,332
TO DROP BY CLOSE TO 10% FROM 

229
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,234
THEIR LEVELS IN 2016. 

230
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,769
AND I HAVE DIRECTED THE 

231
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,636
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO 

232
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,706
IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE GREAT 

233
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,843
CITY OF CHICAGO TO HELP 

234
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,779
STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TERRIBLE 

235
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,146
SHOOTING WAVE. 

236
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,047
WE WANT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT 

237
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,115
FAST. 

238
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,084
THERE'S NO REASON FOR WHAT'S 

239
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:09,088
GOING ON THERE. 

240
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,090
[APPLAUSE] 

241
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,092
I'VE TOLD THEM TO WORK WITH 

242
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,027
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TRY TO 

243
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,631
CHANGE THE TERRIBLE DEAL THE 

244
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,868
CITY OF CHICAGO ENTERED INTO 

245
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:27,206
WITH ACLU, WHICH TIES LAW 

246
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:27,873
ENFORCEMENT'S HANDS. 

247
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,876
AND TO STRONGLY CONSIDER STOP 

248
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,176
AND FRISK. 

249
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,479
IT WORKS AND WAS MEANT FOR 

250
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,347
PROBLEMS LIKE CHICAGO. 

251
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,082
IT WAS MEANT FOR IT. 

252
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,485
STOP AND FRISK. 

253
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:44,390
[APPLAUSE] 

254
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,726
AND RUDY GIULIANI WHEN HE WAS 

255
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,761
MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY HAD A 

256
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,130
VERY STRONG PROGRAM OF STOP AND 

257
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,898
FRISK AND IT WENT FROM AN 

258
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:56,302
UNACCEPTABLY DANGEROUS CITY TO 

259
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,870
ONE OF THE SAFEST CITIES IN THE 

260
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,271
COUNTRY, AND I THINK THE SAFEST 

261
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:02,775
BIG CITY IN THE COUNTRY, SO IT 

262
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,042
WORKS. 

263
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,477
GOT TO BE SAFELY APPLIED, BUT 

264
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,078
STOP AND FRISK WORKS. 

265
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,180
THE CRIME SPREE IS A TERRIBLE 

266
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,615
BLIGHT ON THAT CITY, AND WE'LL 

267
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,084
DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET 

268
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,219
IT DONE. 

269
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,754
I KNOW THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

270
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,189
PEOPLE IN CHICAGO, AND I KNOW 

271
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,025
HOW GOOD THEY ARE. 

272
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,193
THEY COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF 

273
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,962
THEY WERE SIMPLY ALLOWED TO DO 

274
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,163
THEIR JOB, AND DO THEIR JOB 

275
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,197
PROPERLY, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY 

276
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:25,831
WANT TO DO. 

277
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,067
SO CHICAGO, WE'RE GOING TO 

278
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,736
START WORKING WITH YOU, AS OF 

279
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,172
TODAY. 

280
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,975
[APPLAUSE] 

281
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,710
THANK YOU. 

282
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,080
IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018, MY 

283
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,448
ADMINISTRATION BROUGHT CHARGES 

284
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,449
AGAINST MORE FEDERAL FIREARM 

285
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,349
DEFENDANTS, AND MORE VIOLENT 

286
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,052
CRIMINALS THAN EVER BEFORE IN 

287
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,087
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

288
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,123
AND TO HELP FORMER INMATES 

289
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:51,791
BECOME LAW-ABIDING AND 

290
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,226
PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY, 

291
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,196
WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON A PRISON 

292
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:57,529
REFORM BILL. 

293
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,764
VERY, VERY BIG AND 

294
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,197
COMPREHENSIVE ONE. 

295
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,000
AND THE BEST THING THAT COULD 

296
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,668
HAPPEN, I THINK WE'VE ALREADY 

297
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,035
DONE. 

298
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,503
WE HAVE RECORD NUMBERS OF JOBS 

299
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,371

300
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,207
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME WHERE 

301
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,076
MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN OUR 

302
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:15,848
COUNTRY THAN RIGHT NOW. 

303
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,185
[APPLAUSE] 

304
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,920
AND OUR UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS IN 

305
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,923
ALMOST EVERY CATEGORY ARE AT 

306
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:24,523
RECORD LOWS. 

307
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,359
THEY ARE RECORD LOWS.

AN ECONOMY, AND THAT'S A GREAT 

316
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,172
THING WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 

317
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,306
PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISON, 

318
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,742
UNABLE TO GET A JOB. 

319
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:47,013
TOTALLY UNABLE TO GET A JOB. 

320
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,847
IT'S A HOPELESS SITUATION. 

321
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,483
NOW THEY'RE GETTING JOBS TO A 

322
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,017

323
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,086
EXTENT, BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SO 

324
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:54,353

325
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,688
EMPLOYERS ARE FORCED TO TAKE 

326
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,358
PEOPLE THAT THEY MAY BE 

327
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,660
WOULDN'T HAVEDONE, AND SOME OF 

328
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,229
THOSE EMPLOYERS GET BACK TO ME, 

329
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,263
AND SAY MR. PRESIDENTS, IT'S

00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,765
AMAZING HOW GOOD THESE PEOPLE 

331
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:05,965

332
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,066
NOT ALL OF THEM. 

333
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,300
NOT ALL OF ANYBODY OR ANY 

334
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,503
CATEGORY IS GOING TO BE GREAT. 

335
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,604
BUT TREMENDOUS RESPONSE. 

336
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,371
AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

337
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,874
GIVEN A SECOND, OR EVEN IN SOME 

338
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,109
CASES A THIRD SHOT AT IT, AND 

339
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,344
THEY'RE DOING REALLY WELL. 

340
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,614
SO THE ECONOMY BEING SO GREAT, 

341
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:26,886

00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:44,763
TREMENDOUS TALENT IN OUR LEGAL 

373
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,097

374
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,335

375

376
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,240
A FLAWLESS PERSON. 

377
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,008

378
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:57,810

379
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,545
INCREDIBLE RECORD OVER MANY

00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,948
YEARS, AND YET HE'S A YOUNG 

381
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,148
MAN. 

382
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:03,782

383
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,584

385
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,188
THIS IS GOING TO BE SO EASY. 

386
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,923
IT SHOULD GO QUICKLY, NICELY. 

387
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:14,927
DON'T EVEN WORRY. 

388
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:15,760
HE WAS SO THANKFUL. 

389
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,396
HE SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS 

390
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,898
THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. 

391
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,133
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. 

392
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,334
THE GREATEST OF MY LIFE. 

393
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,170
SO I HAVEN'T HEARD HIM SAY THAT 

394
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,503

395
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,473
BUT HE'S A GREAT PERSON, AND IT 

396
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:33,112
WAS VERY, VERY UNFAIR WHAT 

397
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:38,217
HAPPENED TO HIM. 

398
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:38,584
FALSE CHARGES. 

399
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,017
FALSE ACCUSATIONS. 

400
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,319
HORRIBLE STATEMENTS THAT WERE 

401
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,754
TOTALLY UNTRUE, THAT HE KNEW 

402
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,121
NOTHING ABOUT. 

403
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,055
FRANKLY TERMS THAT HE HAD NEVER 

404
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,390
HEARD IN HIS LIFE. 

405
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,760
HE WAS THIS, HE WAS THAT. 

406
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,730
HE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THESE 

407
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:51,963
TERMS. 

408
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,132
WAS A DISGRACEFUL SITUATION, 

409
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,800
BROUGHT ABOUT PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO 

410
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,403
ARE EVIL, AND HE TOUGHED IT 

411
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:57,603
OUT. 

412
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,206
WE ALL TOUGHED IT OUT TOGETHER. 

413
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,942
WE HAVE TO THANK THE REPUBLICAN 

414
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,343
SENATORS THAT FOUGHT SO HARD 

415
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,177
FOR THIS, BECAUSE IT WASN'T 

416
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,579
EASY, AND IT WAS A GREAT HONOR 

417
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:08,714
TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS 

418
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:09,014
SITUATION. 

419
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,050
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE  

420
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,821
SAID LET'S GIVE IT UP, LET'S GO 

421
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,289

422
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,089
WE DON'T GIVE UP. 

423
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,225
YOU DON'T GIVE UP. 

424
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,927
JUST DON'T DO IT. 

425
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,329
HE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT 

426
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,197

THAT'S A VERY EXCITING. 

434
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,175
SO I LEAVE HERE, AND I GO HOME, 

435
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:40,212
