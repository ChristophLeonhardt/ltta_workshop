GARLAND. 
HE SAID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
NEEDED A BETTER CHANCE TO SPEAK 
AND IF THEY DECIDE DEMOCRATS 
SHOULD CONTROL THE SENATE THAN 
IT'S VERY HARD TO ARGUE THAT 
REPUBLICANS SHOULD PUSH THROUGH 
A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IN THE 
MONTH OF DECEMBER. 
>> WHAT I'VE BEEN WONDERING AND 
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, 
IS THAT IF THIS PROCESS IS 
RUSHED AND AS THERE ARE MORE 
EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS, IF THE 
REPUBLICANS RUSH THIS PROCESS, 
AND THEY CAN GET WHAT THEY WANT 
ON THE PRIMA CORD, WITH THEY 
HAVE TO PAY DURING THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS? 
I DON'T KNOW HOW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH NOW BECOMES A SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE WITHOUT AN 
ASTERISK BESIDE HIS NAME AND 
WITHOUT IT BEING TAINTED IN 
SOME WAY. 
THAT'S GOT TO PLAY OUT IN THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
ANYONE UPSET ABOUT HOW THE 
PROCESS HAS UNFOLDED -- 
>> THE ONE ACCUSATION IS BAD, 
TWO AND NOW THREE, THESE ARE 
EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS. 
THE QUESTION BECOMES -- I MEAN 
-- IS THERE GOING TO BE SOME 
SORT OF PRESSURE? 
EVEN IF WE UNDERSTAND THE 
PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE TO LOSE 
AND IF HE BELIEVES THERE IS A 
CON JOB OR MEMBERS WHO BELIEVE 
IT IS A SMEAR TACTIC BY 
DEMOCRATS -- FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND MITCH McCONNELL, 
WHAT DO THEY DO? 
DO THEY SAY THAT FOR THE GOOD 
OF THE COUNTRY, FOR YOUR FAMILY 
AND FOR THE PARTY, THIS MAY NOT 
BE THE BEST PATH FORWARD? 
>> FOR MITCH McCONNELL, PLAIN 
AND SIMPLE, IT'S A NUMBERS 
GAME. 
IF HE THINKS HE CAN GET 
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED, HE IS 
GOING TO STICK WITH HIM FOR THE 
REASONS I OUTLINED BEFORE. 
YES, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE 
COULD TAKE THIS INTANGIBLE HIT 
IN THE MIDTERMS. 
HE MAY FEEL THAT IS MORE OF A 
TANGIBLE VICTORY OF GETTING ON 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
BEYOND THAT, THE REALITY FOR HIM
IS THAT THE MINUTE TWO OR MORE 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS -- THE 
AMOUNT HE CAN AFFORD TO LOSE IF 
DEMOCRATS VOTE NO, THE MINUTE 
THEY SAY I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS 
GUY, IT'S OVER. 
IT'S OVER AND McCONNELL KNOWS 
THAT. 
MAYBE HE WILL HAVE EVERYONE 
TAKE A VOTE TO SHOW HE DOESN'T 
HAVE THE VOTE OR MAYBE HE 
DECIDES I DON'T WANT TO MAKE 
EVERYONE TAKE A VOTE. 
HE MAY GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND
SAY HE CAN'T GET HIM CONFIRMED 
BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED, YET. 
>> NANCY, I HOPE YOU CAN STICK 
AROUND. 
CLEARLY WE WOULD WANT TO HEAR 
FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. 
MY THOUGHTS ARE THEY WON'T BE 
HAVING A LOT OPPRESSED WHILE 
THEY DIGEST THIS INFORMATION. 
STICK AROUND BECAUSE WE WANT TO 
BRING IN AN ATTORNEY THAT IS 
JOINING US ON THE PHONE TO TALK 
US THROUGH THIS. 
THANK YOU JULIE RENDLEMAN FOR 
JOINING US. 
ANNE-MARIE POINTED OUT THAT THE 
AFFIDAVIT RELEASED BY ATTORNEY 
MICHAEL AVENATTI IS SUBMITTED 
AND YOU CANNOT LIE IN THESE. 
IF YOU DO, THEN YOU COULD BE -- 
THIS IS PERJURY. 
THE THREAT OF PERJURY. 
>> I CAN SEE A SITUATION WHERE 
SUPPORTERS OF MR. KAVANAUGH 
SAY, LOOK, THESE ARE JUST 
ALLEGATIONS AND THERE IS NO 
PROOF OF THIS. 
WHAT DOES THIS AFFIDAVIT MEAN, 
LEGALLY SPEAKING, WHEN IT COMES 
TO THESE ALLEGATIONS? 
WHERE DOES THE BURDEN OF PROOF 
LIVE? 
>> FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY WE 
WERE ALL WAITING FOR MR. 
AVENATTI. 
I THINK IT WAS 48 HOURS AND 
PEOPLE QUESTION WHETHER HE 
WOULD AND HE FULFILLED HIS 
PROMISE. 
WHAT IS THIS AFFIDAVIT? 
IT HAS CREDIBILITY BECAUSE IT 
IS A SWORN AFFIDAVIT. 
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S NO CHANCE OF 
CROSS-EXAMINATION UNLESS SHE IS 
PERMITTED TO TESTIFY LIKE 
EVERYONE ELSE. 
MANY WILL SAY SHE SHOULD BE 
TESTIFYING, AS WELL. 
THE BIG THING ABOUT WHAT SHE 
SAYS IS THAT SHE REFUTES NOT 
ONLY EVERYTHING KAVANAUGH SAYS 
BUT THERE WAS AN ILL-ADVISED 
INTERVIEW AND THERE WERE A LOT 
OF DETAILS IN REGARDS TO HIS 
BEHAVIOR BACK THEN AND THE 
BEHAVIOR OF MARK JUDGE WHICH 
CORROBORATES WHAT THE MAIN 
WITNESS IS SAYING AND THAT 
HURTS KAVANAUGH INCREDIBLY. 
>> I WAS CURIOUS WHAT YOU 
THOUGHT ABOUT THE WAY THE 
DECLARATION WAS MAPPED OUT. 
THE MOST EXPLOSIVE PART DOESN'T 
COME UNTIL THE VERY END. 
THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING 
VERY STRATEGIC ABOUT HOW SHE 
EXPLAINS HOW SHE MET MARK JUDGE 
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE NATURE 
OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND HOW SHE 
OBSERVED THE TWO MEN AND THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT HOW IT 
IS ALL SORT OF LAID OUT? 
>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. 
WHEN SHE DESCRIBES WHO SHE IS, 
NOT JUST SOME WOMAN COMING OUT 
OF NOWHERE, THIS IS A WOMAN WHO 
HAD SECURITY CLEARANCES TIME 
AND TIME AGAIN AND NOT SOMEONE 
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE AN AX TO 
GRIND. 
ALTHOUGH, REMEMBER THAT SHE 
HASN'T BEEN INVENTED. 
SHE WAS VETTED ARGUABLY BY 
AVENATTI BUT BOTH SIDES HAVE A 
RIGHT TO VETERAN MAKE A 
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR 
NOT THERE IS ANY BIAS OR ANY 
REASON SHE MIGHT COME FORWARD 
AND BE DISHONEST. 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WAS 
SURPRISED TO HEAR AGAIN FROM 
ANOTHER FEMALE THAT WHEN 
KAVANAUGH WAS YOUNGER, THAT 
ESTABLISHES HE WAS A BIG 
DRINKER, A BIG PARTIER AND THAT 
IT LED TO SOME ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR 
TOWARD WOMEN. I 
DON'T THINK IT IS A SHOCKER 
BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN 
HEARING AND I CERTAINLY THINK 
IT CONTRADICTS INCREDIBLY WHAT 
HE'S TRYING TO ESTABLISH 
HIMSELF AS. 
HE MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT TODAY 
THAN HE WAS THEN BUT IT DOESN'T 
REMOVE THE FACT THAT HE BEHAVED 
LIKE HE DID WHEN HE WAS YOUNG. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT MR. 
KAVANAUGH HAS THIS CALENDAR 
THAT HE SAID HE HAS. 
IT'S SURPRISING THAT HE IS AN 
INCREDIBLE LAWYER AND HE WOULD 
SAY, I'VE GOT THIS CALENDAR 
THAT I KEPT WHEN I WAS A 
TEENAGER AND IT SHOWS ALL THESE 
ACTIVITIES INCLUDING BEACH 
WEEK. 
WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING IS 
THAT NUMBER NINE ON THE 
AFFIDAVIT FROM MR. AVENATTI AND 
FROM MS. SWETNICK. 
HE SAID I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS 
OCCURRED IN OCEAN CITY, 
MARYLAND AND I WITNESSED THIS 
ON ONE OCCASION IN OCEAN CITY, 
MARYLAND DURING BEACH WEEK. 
HE WAS SUGGESTING HE WAS THERE 
TO EXONERATE HIM. 
IF YOU WERE IN COURT AND 
SOMEBODY WERE IT IS -- SOMEBODY 
WAS TRYING TO PROVE INNOCENCE 
BY GOING BACK TO A CALENDAR IN 
THE OUR TEEN YEARS, IS THAT 
ADMISSIBLE? 
>> IT MIGHT BE. 
WHAT YOU GET IS THAT WHEN YOU 
HAVE A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT, ONE 
THING YOU SAY IS KEEP YOUR 
MOUTH SHUT. 
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. 
THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK WILL 
HELP YOU WILL HURT YOU IN THE 
END BECAUSE YOU WILL BE TIED TO 
WHAT YOU SAID. 
IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND 
SUGGEST A SPECIFIC LOCATION 
LIKE HE SUGGESTED, IT IT OPENS 
THE DOOR TO WITNESS IS SAYING, I
SAW HIM THERE AND HE WAS RAPING 
A WOMAN OR ATTACKING A WOMAN OR 
HE WAS INEBRIATED AND BEING 
INAPPROPRIATE TO WOMEN. 
NOW, HE'S TIED HIMSELF INTO 
THOSE SPECIFIC TIMES AND 
WITNESSES ARE NOW SAYING HE DID 
SOMETHING COMPLETELY ABHORRENT. 
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE FEELS THE 
NEED TO OPEN HIS MOUTH. I 
WOULD KILL TO BE CROSS-
EXAMINING HIM. 
UNFORTUNATELY, I WON'T GET THAT 
CHANCE. 
>> JULIE, STAND BY. 
WE WILL BE JOINED BY RIKKI 
KLEIMAN ON THE PHONE. 
BEFORE WE GET TO THIS QUESTION, 
I WENT TO GET BACK TO NANCY. 
IF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE CHOOSES TO IGNORE 
THIS ALLEGATION AND I DON'T 
KNOW IF THEY CAN -- BUT IF THEY 
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS HEARING, 
CAN THE DEMOCRATS RAISE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THIRD 
ACCUSER IN THE HEARING 
TOMORROW? 
OR WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED OUT 
OF LINE SINCE NONE OF THE 
PEOPLE INVOLVED ARE THERE? 
>> Reporter: THEY CAN TALK 
ABOUT ANYTHING THEY WANT. 
THEY OBVIOUSLY WOULD POSE MORE 
QUESTIONS TO KAVANAUGH, 
HIMSELF, RATHER THAN FORD 
ALTHOUGH THEY COULD ASK HER AS 
SOMEONE WHO ATTENDED AT LEAST 
ONE PARTY WITH KAVANAUGH, 
HERSELF. 
OR, IF THEY FELT WHAT HAPPENED 
TO HER WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DO 
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF 
WHAT SWETNICK OUTLINES HAPPENED 
TO HER AT A LARGER PARTY. 
REPUBLICANS, OSTENSIBLY, COULD 
ASK THE SAME THING ALTHOUGH 
IT'S LIKELY THAT MOST OF THEM 
WILL STEER CLEAR. 
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, EVEN 
THOUGH THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE 
INCREDIBLY EXPLOSIVE, THERE MAY 
BE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO WANT 
TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS BECAUSE 
THEY WANT TO GET CHRISTINE FORD 
ON THE RECORD AND THEY WANT TO 
BE ABLE TO SEE HER AND HEAR 
FROM HER. 
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE MORE 
POWERFUL THAN SEEING A 
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE IN WHICH 
SOMEONE WAS INTERVIEWED. 
IT MAY BE THAT SHE IS A VERY 
POWERFUL -- PROVIDES A POWERFUL 
ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HER 
AND IT MIGHT MAKE HER MORE 
BELIEVABLE. 
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE 
WALK AWAY BEING OVERWHELMED. 
WE JUST DON'T KNOW. 
IT'S A COMBINATION OF HAVING 
THIS INFORMATION OUT AND THE 
IRONIC THING, I HAVE TO TELL 
YOU, IS THAT EVEN DEMOCRATS ARE 
KIND OF KEEPING AVENATTI AT 
ARMS LENGTH THROUGH THE EARLY 
PART OF THE WEEK BECAUSE HE HAS 
A REPUTATION, FAIRLY OR 
UNFAIRLY, ON CAPITOL HILL, AS 
BEING THE LAWYER OF STORMY 
DANIELS. 
HE LOVES THE CAMERA AND 
DEMOCRATS, JUST LIKE 
REPUBLICANS, DON'T QUITE KNOW 
WHAT TO MAKE OF WHAT HE PUT IN 
THE EMAILS ABOUT GANG RAPE AND 
ALL THE REST AND THEY WERE 
WORRIED, FRANKLY, THAT WAS 
HURTING THEM BECAUSE THEY 
DIDN'T KNOW IF HE ACTUALLY HAD 
THE GOODS TO BACK UP WHAT HE 
WAS SAYING. 
THEY DON'T HAVE A LONG HISTORY 
WITH HIM. 
HE HAS BEEN SAYING TO ME, THE 
ENTIRE TIME AND TO OTHERS, IS 
THAT HE DID HAVE A CREDIBLE 
CLIENT WHO WAS READY AND 
WILLING TO GO PUBLIC AND WITHIN 
THE NEXT 48 HOURS, WHILE HE IS 
SOMEWHAT NEW TO THE POLITICAL 
WORLD AND WITHIN THE LAST YEAR 
OR SO BECAUSE OF THE 
PRESENTATION OF CHARLIE'S -- 
STORMY DANIELS, HE IS ACTUALLY 
A LAWYER WITH A LOT OF 
VICTORIES IN COURT AS A TRIAL 
LAWYER. 
HE SAID IT WAS NOT IN HIS 
INTEREST TO HURT HIS REPUTATION 
BY OVERPROMISING WHEN HE DIDN'T 
ACTUALLY HAVE A SERIOUS CLIENT 
WILLING TO COME FORWARD AT THE 
END OF THE DAY. 
>> I'VE SEEN SOME PUNDITS AND 
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA SUGGESTING 
THAT THE WEAPONIZATION, IF YOU 
WILL, OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT, 
COULD COME BACK TO HURT THEM 
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE THINGS 
YOU POINT OUT ABOUT RICKY -- 
ABOUT MICHAEL AVENATTI. 
WE HAVE RIKKI KLEIMAN WITH US. 
HE WAS TEASING A THIRD CLIENT. 
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. 
IS NOT THE TYPE OF LAWYER THAT 
WOULD RISK HIS REPUTATION. 
NO ATTORNEY WOULD RISK THEIR 
REPUTATION AT THIS LEVEL OF THE 
GAME IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THE 
GOODS AND NOW, IT APPEARS ON 
PAPER THAT MR. AVENATTI HAS 
DELIVERED? 
>> Reporter: MICHAEL AVENATTI 
ANNOUNCED THAT AND IT'S NO 
SURPRISE TO ME, HE ANNOUNCED IT 
ON RACHEL MADDOX THE OTHER 
NIGHT. 
HE AS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WHAT HE 
HAD AND HE ALSO WAS ABUNDANTLY 
CLEAR THAT HE WOULD DO IT AS AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT, APPROPRIATELY AND 
WITHIN 48 HOURS AT A POINT 
WHERE HE FELT THAT THE VICTIM'S 
SAFETY, HIS CLIENT'S SAFETY WAS 
IN A BETTER POSITION THAN AT 
THE TIME HE ANNOUNCED IT. 
WHAT HE CAME UP WITH IS WHAT I 
EXPECTED. 
IT'S NOT A SURPRISE IF ANYONE 
WAS LISTENING OR FOLLOWING HIM 
ON TWITTER. 
I'VE FOLLOWED AVENATTI'S WORK 
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 
STORMY DANIELS CASE. 
HE DOES NOT BLUFF. 
HE WAS GIVEN THE WORK IN TERMS 
OF HIS WRITTEN PRODUCT AND HE 
FOLLOWS THROUGH ON WHAT HE SAYS 
HE'S GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH. 
SO, THE FACT THAT HE NOW CAN 
RAISE THIS AFFIDAVIT IN ITS 
APPALLING DETAIL -- AND ONE OF 
THE THINGS INTERESTING ABOUT 
THE GANG RAPE THAT IS OUTLINED 
BY THE AFFIDAVIT -- IT'S NOTED 
THAT MARK JUDGE AND BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WERE PRESENT. 
THE INTERVIEW THAT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH DID ON FOX NEWS IS 
DIRECTLY CONTRADICTORY TO EVEN 
THE IDEA OF BEING PRESENT 
BECAUSE HE HAS DENIED THAT HE 
KNEW ABOUT ANYTHING CONCERNING 
GANG RAPE. 
>> YEAH. 
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT IN 
THIS CASE. 
HE DID NOT JUST BEING THERE, 
AND IT IS SORT AS THE -- SORT 
OF THE LOWEST LEVEL OF 
ACCUSATION. 
YOU ARE AT A PARTY WITH 
UNDERAGE DRINKING AND WHILE 
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, IN THIS 
CASE. 
THE FACT THAT HE DENIED THAT 
CALLS INTO QUESTION ALMOST 
EVERYTHING ELSE HE SAID THAT HE 
STOOD FOR. 
>> Reporter: ANNE-MARIE, AS YOU 
KNOW, BECAUSE I WAS VERY CLEAR 
ABOUT A -- WHETHER ON OR OFF 
CAMERA -- I THOUGHT THAT THE 
INTERVIEW ON FOX NEWS WAS A 
TERRIBLE MISTAKE. 
IT WAS ILL ADVISED. 
NO MATTER HOW WELL HE MAY HAVE 
COME ACROSS, THE REALITY IS THAT
IT IS A LAWYER'S STREAM TO HAVE 
MATERIAL FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION 
AND HOW YOU GET THAT MATERIAL 
-- IT'S BECAUSE THE WITNESS 
MAKES A PRIOR STATEMENT. 
NOW, YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE 
PRIOR STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE 
ON FOX NEWS AND THEY CANNOT BE 
ERASED. 
THEREFORE, AS NANCY CORDES 
POINTS OUT, THE DEMOCRATS MAY 
HAVE FIVE MINUTES EACH. 
NEVERTHELESS, THEY HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO USE THOSE FIVE 
MINUTES IN A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY 
BY WHATEVER MEANS THEY DECIDE, 
TO DIVIDE UP THEIR TIME. 
THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD CROSS 
EXAMINER IN KAMALA HARRIS. 
THIS IS FROM HER WORLD. 
THE FOX NEWS INTERVIEW WAS A 
TERRIBLE MISTAKE. 
>> I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE 
PREVIOUS NOMINEES. 
AND, UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES 
WERE NAMES REMOVED FROM THE 
NOMINATION PROCESS? 
>> ONE I CAN REMEMBER IS 
HARRIET MYERS, NOMINATED BY 
FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. 
BUSH. 
SHE WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF 
HIS AND HIS FAMILY AND WORKED 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
SHE HAD VERY LITTLE 
UNDERSTANDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
LAW AND EVEN BEFORE SHE GOT TO 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY PROCESS, 
AND IF YOU REMEMBER THIS -- I'M 
USING MY OWN MEMORY -- BUT I 
REMEMBER HARRIET MYERS DIDN'T 
EVEN GET TO THE FLOOR OF THE 
SENATE FROM THE COMMITTEE LEVEL 
BECAUSE SHE CHOSE, HERSELF, TO 
WITHDRAW HER NOMINATION AND THE 
PRESIDENT ACCEPTED IT BECAUSE 
IT TURNED OUT SHE HAD BEEN MORE 
OF LIKE A PAL. 
>> SHE WAS A LAWYER BUT SHE 
WORKED IN AN OFFICE AND HAD 
NEVER BEEN A JUDGE AND HAD 
NEVER JUDGED CASES. 
IN MODERN TIMES, THAT IS THE 
ONLY ONE I CAN REMEMBER. 
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN OTHERS, FOR 
SURE. 
>> NANCY, CAN YOU RECALL UNDER 
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES A SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE HAS REMOVED THEIR 
NAME OR HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED? 
>> Reporter: WITHDRAWN? 
SURE. 
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES LIKE 
HARRIET MYERS HAVE WITHDRAWN 
THEMSELVES FROM CONSIDERATION 
FOR FAR LESS EXPLOSIVE REASONS. 
>> A GREAT POINT. 
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW ROBERT 
BORK -- HOW HE WAS REMOVED FROM 
THE NOMINATING PROCESS BUT I 
KNOW THERE WAS LOT OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT HIS BELIEFS AND HIS 
INTERPRETATION OF THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
I DON'T RECALL ANYBODY EVER 
HAVING ALLEGATIONS AS EXPLOSIVE 
AS THESE. 
PERHAPS THERE WERE? 
>> I WONDER IF WE ARE NOW 
PERMANENTLY CHANGING THIS 
PROCESS. 
NANCY, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FBI 
VETTING PROCESS AND IT PROBABLY 
DIDN'T INCLUDE WHAT YOU DID IN 
HIGH SCHOOL. 
>> PEOPLE ON TWITTER ARE 
SUGGESTING THAT THE FBI DOESN'T 
ACTUALLY LOOK AT STUFF BEFORE 
YOU ARE 18. 
>> NANCY, COULD WE BE SEEING A 
CHANGE HERE? 
IF BRETT KAVANAUGH DECIDES HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS 
PROCESS AND REMOVES HIS NAME, 
THE NEXT PERSON CHOSEN, I'M 
SURE, WILL LOOK BACK TO THEIR 
HIGH SCHOOL CAREER, IF YOU CAN 
CALL IT THAT. 
THEY WILL FIGURE OUT ANY 
MISDEEDS THEY MIGHT HAVE 
PARTICIPATED IN. 
IS THIS A PERMANENT CHANGE IN 
HOW SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ARE 
CHOSEN? 
IT DOES MATTER WHAT YOU DID AT 
17 FROM NOW ON? 
>> Reporter: THIS IS A VERY 
PARTICULAR SITUATION AND I'M 
SURE HE WAS ASKED, EVEN BEFORE 
FORMALLY VETTED BY THE FBI, 
WHENEVER HE SPOKE TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, I'M SURE THEY ASKED IF 
THERE WAS ANYTHING IN HIS 
BACKGROUND THAT WOULD BE 
EMBARRASSING. 
THAT IS SORT OF LIKE THE BASIC 
INTRODUCTORY QUESTION. 
ANY SURPRISES IN YOUR 
BACKGROUND? 
THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE, 
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE A 
TEENAGER, THEY MAY BE RELUCTANT 
FOR THIS REASON TO SUBJECT 
THEMSELVES TO SCRUTINY. 
THEY MIGHT SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, 
I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH 
IT. 
I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS ONE CASE 
IS REPRESENTATIVE OF A WHOLE 
SEA CHANGE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES ALL THAT 
OFTEN AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF 
THEM IS DIFFERENT. 
LOOK AT NEIL GORSUCH, JUST LAST 
YEAR. 
HE ALSO WENT TO GEORGETOWN PREP 
AND IS PRETTY CLOSE IN AGE TO 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY LOOKED AT 
HIS HIGH SCHOOL BACKGROUND BUT 
NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO SAID HE 
HAD -- TO SAY HE HAD DONE 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS. 
EVERY NOMINEE IS DIFFERENT AND 
A CHARGE OF SHOPLIFTING WHEN 
YOU ARE A TEENAGER, AS SOME 
BACKGROUND CHECKS MIGHT TURN 
UP, IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN A 
CHARGE OF GANG RAPE. 
>> JULIE, YOU WANTED TO CHIME 
IN ON THAT? 
>> WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE 
TYPICAL 17-YEAR-OLD BEHAVIOR, I 
ASSUME. 
HE'S NOT ACCUSED, AS YOU SAID, 
OF SIMPLE SHOPLIFTING. 
MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY I WAS 
YOUNG AND MADE A STUPID 
MISTAKE. 
HIS BEHAVIOR, IF WE BELIEVE IT 
TO BE TRUE IS SO INCREDIBLY 
ABHORRENT AND SO AGAINST 
EVERYTHING THAT WE SHOULD BE 
BELIEVING IN IN TERMS OF WHO OUR
JUSTICE IS. 
REMEMBER, HE WILL MAKE 
DECISIONS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF 
WOMEN AS A SUPREME COURT JUDGE. 
WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT AND 
COULDN'T EVER IGNORE THAT. 
THE THING IS THAT IF HE HAS 
DONE THESE THINGS, THEY ARE SO 
INCREDIBLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT IT 
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO 
SIT AS A SUPREME COURT JUDGE. 
OTHER PEOPLE MAY HAVE LITTLE 
THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE THAT 
WOULDN'T BE RELEVANT TO A 
DECISION-MAKER. 
>> TO POINT OUT, THESE ARE 
ALLEGATIONS AND CBS NEWS HAS 
NOT CONFIRMED THESE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
>> WE ARE SEEING A NOTE AND 
NANCY, YOU'VE SEEN THIS, WE WILL
RELAY IT TO THE VIEWERS. 
IT SUCKED -- IT COMES FROM THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMUNICATIONS 
DIRECTOR. 
THIS MORNING, MICHAEL AVENATTI 
PROVIDED A DECLARATION TO THE 
COMMITTEE AND LAWYERS ARE IN 
THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING IT, 
NOW. 
AS ANNE-MARIE POINTS OUT, THESE 
ARE ALLEGATIONS BUT OUR VIEWERS 
ARE JUST TUNING IN TO CBSN 
RIGHT WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO 
THE TOP OF THE HOUR. 
IT'S THE NEWS THAT MICHAEL 
AVENATTI HAD BEEN SUGGESTING ALL
WEEK LONG THAT HE WAS GOING TO 
PROVIDE TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE AND TO THE MEDIA, IS 
OF THIS THIRD ACCUSER ACCUSING 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH OF EXPLOSIVE INSTANCES
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, 
ESSENTIALLY. 
I'M GOING TO READ FROM THE 
AFFIDAVIT, THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT 
THAT IS PROVIDED TO MR. 
AVENATTI AND THAT MR. AVENATTI 
HAS PROVIDED TO THE PRESS. 
IN ONE OF THOSE PARAGRAPHS, AND 
WHAT I'M READING, IT WOULD BE 
CONSIDERED THE LEAST VOLATILE 
OR EXPLOSIVE OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
TO POINT OUT WHY THERE WERE SO 
MANY CONCERNED THAT MR. 
KAVANAUGH WOULD BE GIVEN A 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE 
SUPREME COURT AND WOULD HAVE 
THE POWER AND DECISION-MAKING 
OVER THE LIVES OF 400 MILLION 
AMERICANS, INCLUDING WOMEN, 
OBVIOUSLY. 
OF ONE OF THE PARAGRAPH SHE 
STATES, FOLLOWING THE FIRST 
INTRODUCTION, I ATTENDED WELL 
OVER 10 HOUSE PARTIES IN THE 
WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA DURING 
1981-1983 WERE MARK JUDGE -- 
THE MEN WHO WAS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S FRIEND -- AND BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WERE PRESENT. 
THESE PARTIES WERE COMMON 
OCCURRENCES IN THE AREA. 
ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS I 
WITNESSED MARK JUDGE AND BRETT 
KAVANAUGH DRINK EXCESSIVELY AND 
ENGAGE IN HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE 
CONDUCT INCLUDING BEING OVERLY 
AGGRESSIVE WITH GIRLS. 
NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER. 
THIS CONDUCT INCLUDED THE 
FONDLING AND GRABBING OF GIRLS 
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. I 
OBSERVED BRETT KAVANAUGH DRINK 
EXCESSIVELY AT MANY OF THESE 
PARTIES AND ENGAGE IN ABUSIVE 
AND FIGURES LIKELY AGGRESSIVE 
BEHAVIOR TOWARD GIRLS INCLUDING 
PRESS AND GIRLS AGAINST THEM 
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT, GRINDING 
AGAINST GIRLS AND ATTEMPTING TO 
REMOVE OR SHIFT THEIR CLOTHING 
TO EXPOSE PRIVATE BODY PARTS. 
HE SPOKE ABOUT GIRLS DEMEANING 
ONLY IN GENERAL AND BY NAME AND 
I WITNESSED HIM BEHAVE AS A 
MEAN DRUNK ON MANY OCCASIONS AT 
THESE PARTIES. 
THAT IS THE SEVENTH PARAGRAPH 
AND IT GOES ON. 
>> JUST TO INTERJECT, PART OF 
THE REASON THAT THESE ARE THE 
LEAST EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS OR 
WHY THEY ARE STILL IMPORTANT IS 
BECAUSE THEY DIRECTLY 
CONTRADICT WHAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
SAID IN HIS FOX NEWS INTERVIEW 
AND WHAT HIS FRIEND MARK JUDGE 
SAID WHO DISMISSED THE 
RELATIONSHIP AND SAID HE HAD 
NEVER REALLY SEEN BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AT THESE PARTIES 
BEHAVING IN THIS WAY. 
IT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS IT. 
>> I THINK WE HAVE HIM ON THE 
RECORD IN THAT FOX NEWS 
INTERVIEW SUGGESTING THAT HE IS 
ESSENTIALLY A CHOIR BOY. 
HE WENT TO CHURCH AND HUNG OUT 
WITH HIS PARENTS. 
DID YOU AGREE WITH RIKKI 
KLEIMAN'S TAKE THAT THIS WAS AN 
ILL-ADVISED INTERVIEW? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
AS AN ATTORNEY, YOU TELL YOUR 
CLIENT NOT TO SAY A WORD 
BECAUSE ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN BE 
USED AGAINST YOU. 
EVEN THINGS YOU THINK ARE 
INNOCENT OR WILL MAKE YOU BE 
BETRAYED AS SOMEONE AS A CHOIR 
BOY, IT MAY COME BACK TO HAUNT 
YOU BECAUSE NOW, A, YOU HAVE 
THE ABILITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE ON 
THINGS YOU SAID BEFORE AND NOW, 
OTHER WITNESSES ARE 
SPECIFICALLY CONTRADICTING 
THINGS HE SAID IN THAT 
INTERVIEW, IN AND OF ITSELF. 
YES, INCREDIBLY EVEN MORE 
DIFFICULT FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY 
IF THERE ARE GOOD CROSS-EXAMINE 
HER'S IN THERE. 
>> JULIE AND NANCY, PLEASE STAND
BY. 
WE HAVE A CRIMINAL DEFENSE 
ATTORNEY AND FORMER PROSECUTOR 
WITH US. 
YOU ARE REPRESENTING AND 
LOOKING AT THIS INFORMATION AND 
LOOKING AT THIS AFFIDAVIT. 
AS A PROSECUTOR, AND A CRIMINAL 
DEFENSE ATTORNEY, YOU HAVE TO 
REPRESENT MR. KAVANAUGH. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? 
>> FIRST, THE TIMING IS 
SUSPECT. 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT 
THAT. 
THESE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN GOING 
ON FOR A WHILE AND IS NOT THE 
FIRST TIME JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS 
BEEN BEFORE THE SENATE. 
HE WAS UP FOR THE CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT. 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM 
THAT PERSPECTIVE. 
THAT BEING SAID, IN TERMS OF 
THE AMOUNT -- NOW, THE NUMBER 
OF ACCUSATIONS, THREE SEPARATE 
ACCUSES -- AND BECAUSE OF THE 
SERIOUSNESS OF THIS ALLEGATION, 
I THINK IT WARRANTS AN 
INVESTIGATION AND A DELAY IN 
THE PROCESS, FOR THIS TO BE 
FULLY VETTED. 
PEOPLE HAVE TO STILL RESPECT 
KAVANAUGH AND SAY, THE GUY HAS 
TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT. 
IT'S THE BEDROCK OF OUR 
INSTITUTION. 
THESE OTHER THINGS, AT THIS 
POINT, THE TIMING AND THE FACT 
THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT STUFF
FROM 35 PLUS YEARS AGO, I THINK 
ALL OF THAT LEADS INTO THE 
TOTAL EQUATION. 
AT THIS POINT, IT HAS TO MERIT 
AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT THE U.S. SUPREME 
COURT. 
>> I'VE BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT THIS 
TACTIC OF THE SUPPORTERS 
INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 
AND THESE ARE ALLEGATIONS FROM 
35 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE 
TEENAGERS. 
ALL OF US, ANY REASONABLE 
PERSON WOULD SAY THAT WHEN YOU 
ARE A CHILD, WHICH IS WHAT YOU 
ARE BEFORE YOU ARE 18, YOU DO 
STUPID THINGS. 
NOT ALL OF US WOULD SUGGEST 
THAT SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT 
ARE ALLEGED ARE TYPICAL OF AN 
AMERICAN OR ANYBODY IN WHATEVER 
COUNTRY, BUT I'M ALWAYS CURIOUS 
ABOUT THE IDEA THAT IT HAPPENED 
35 YEARS AGO. 
SOMEBODY BROUGHT UP THE POINT 
THAT WHEN VICTIMS OF PRIESTS 
WHO SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN 
FINALLY COME TO GRIPS AND ARE 
WILLING TO GO ON THE RECORD 
WITH ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY MAY 
HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATELY 
AGGRESS BY A PRIEST, WE DON'T 
SAY THIS HAPPENED WHEN YOU ARE 
SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 10, 11, SO 
THEY CAN'T BE TRUE. 
PROSECUTORS TAKE THIS AND TRY 
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED. 
>> HERE IS THE THING. 
WHETHER SOMETHING HAPPENS 35 
YEARS AGO OR YESTERDAY, AS A 
PROSECUTOR, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT 
EACH SPECIFIC CASE AND MAKE A 
DETERMINATION AS TO THE 
CREDIBILITY. 
YOU CAN HAVE SOMETHING WHO SAID 
SOMETHING ELSE AND THEY ARE 
LYING ABOUT IT. 
>> Reporter: YOU HAVE TO 
CONSIDER WHY IT IS AND IF THE 
VICTIMS GIVE A VALID AND 
CREDIBLE REASON AS TO WHY THEY 
DIDN'T COME FORWARD, THEN IT 
REALLY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. 
KEEP IN MIND THAT WE DID LIVE 
IN A DIFFERENT TIME 35 YEARS 
AGO. 
SOME OF THIS BEHAVIOR WAS 
EITHER ACCEPTABLE OR -- 
REMEMBER -- IF YOU WERE A WOMAN 
ATTACKED BY THESE YOUNG MEN, 
THEY HAVE AN ENTIRE SCHOOL OF 
BOYS. 
AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED, 
IT STOOD BEHIND THEM AND IT 
MADE IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO 
STEP FORWARD. 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PRESUMPTION 
OF INNOCENCE, THIS IS NOT A 
CRIMINAL TRIAL. 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE 
THINGS, IT'S NOT BEYOND A 
REASONABLE DOUBT SITUATION, IT 
IS IF THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE
IF HE SHOULD BE A SUPREME COURT 
JUDGE. 
WE ARE TELLING HIM HE CAN'T 
SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT THAT 
MAKES DECISIONS FOR THE REST OF 
HIS LIFE AND THAT'S THE 
DIFFERENCE. 
>> SOME THINGS THAT WERE 
INTERESTING, ONE THING TO 
CONSIDER IS THAT IT WAS A 
DIFFERENT TIME. I 
WANT TO ASK NANCY ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT WE ARE IN THE #METOO 
MOVEMENT ERA. 
BILL COSBY IS GOING TO JAIL FOR 
SEVERAL YEARS AND SPENT THE 
NIGHT IN PRISON AND THE 
ACCUSATION IS THAT HE DRUGGED 
WOMEN AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 
THEM AND THOSE ALLEGATIONS CAME 
UP BEFORE THIS ERA. 
IT'S ONLY NOW THAT THEY WERE 
ABLE TO PROSECUTE AND CONVICT 
HIM. 
HO DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW THE 
#METOO MOVEMENT AND THE ARROW 
WE ARE IN FACTORS INTO WHAT'S 
HAPPENING WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH? 
>> I THINK IT IS A HUGE FACTOR, 
THE FACT THAT SO MANY DEMOCRATS 
AND SOME REPUBLICANS SAID FROM 
THE OUTSET THAT EVEN AFTER JUST 
ONE WOMAN CAME FORWARD, I 
BELIEVE HER OR I THINK WE NEED 
TO EXPLORE WHAT SHE IS SAYING. 
IF YOU THINK BACK 20 YEARS AGO 
AND EITHER PRESIDENT CLINTON'S 
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS OR EVEN 
FURTHER BACK WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED
OF LEWD BEHAVIOR BY WOMEN IN 
HIS PAST, DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT 
TO BELIEVE IT AND SO THEY 
DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. 
BY AND LARGE THEY CHOSE TO 
BELIEVE HIM OVER THE ACCUSERS 
AND THEY LOOKED FOR VARIOUS 
REASONS AS TO WHY THESE WOMEN 
WERE NOT RELIABLE. 
THAT STILL HAPPENS, BUT THE 
OVERWHELMING PRESUMPTION, NOW, 
IS THAT IT IS VERY PAINFUL FOR 
WOMEN TO COME FORWARD AND IF 
THEY ARE COMING FORWARD, IT'S 
NOT OPEN AND SHUT. 
THEY DESERVE TO BE HEARD 
BECAUSE THERE IS A VERY STRONG 
CHANCE THAT THERE IS AT LEAST 
SOMETHING TO WHAT THEY ARE 
SAYING. 
CERTAINLY, WHEN YOU HEAR FROM 
MORE WOMEN, THAT MAKES EACH 
WOMAN EVEN MORE BELIEVABLE. 
I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH WHAT A 
VOLATILE SITUATION WE ARE NOW 
IN. 
ON MONDAY, A LOT OF US CAME TO 
WORK HALF EXPECTING THAT, 
PERHAPS, KAVANAUGH WOULD BE 
WITHDRAWING BECAUSE OF THE 
ACCUSATIONS THAT HAD ALREADY 
BEEN LEVELED. 
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND HE AND 
REPUBLICANS DOUBLED DOWN. 
NOW, NOW THAT THESE NEW 
ALLEGATIONS -- VERY DISTURBING 
ALLEGATIONS -- HAVE BEEN MADE, 
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. 
CHUCK GRASSLEY COULD COME OUT 
AT ANY MOMENT AND SAY THE 
HEARING IS POSTPONED. 
THEY ARE OPENING AN 
INVESTIGATION -- YOU KNOW -- 
HE'S CONFERRING WITH REPUBLICAN 
LEADERSHIP, ANYTHING COULD 
HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
HOURS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE 
BIG HEARING THAT WE ALL EXPECT 
TO HAPPEN TOMORROW THAT WILL 
LAST THE ENTIRE DAY. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH COULD ANNOUNCE 
THAT HE IS TAKING A STEP BACK 
IN LIGHT OF THESE ALLEGATIONS. 
THEY DOUBLED DOWN ON MONDAY AND 
MAYBE THEY'VE PLAYED THAT CARD. 
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T, BUT I 
GUARANTEE YOU THESE 
CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 
IN A FAST AND FURIOUS MANNER 
ACROSS HIS CAPITAL AND BETWEEN 
THE LEADER'S OFFICE IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. 
>> NANCY, I KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT
TO GO. 
TELL YOUR PRODUCER, JOHN NOLAN, 
THAT WE ARE SORRY WE KEPT YOU 
HERE SO LONG. 
YOU PROVIDED A WEALTH OF 
INFORMATION. 
JOHN AND NANCY, I HAVE ONE 
FINAL QUESTION. 
YOU TALKED ABOUT BILL COSBY AND 
THE ERA OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT 
AND THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MR. 
COSBY HAPPENED BEFORE THE ME, 
TOO CONFIRMATION -- THE ME, TOO 
ERA. 
THE CLARENCE THOMAS 
CONFIRMATION WAS WELL BEFORE 
THE #METOO MOVEMENT. 
ANITA HILL SAID THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STILL LACKS 
A PROTOCOL FOR VETTING SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT CLAIMS 
THAT SURFACED DURING A 
CONFIRMATION HEARING AND IT 
SUGGESTED THE COMMITTEE LEARNED 
LITTLE FROM THE THOMAS HEARING, 
MUCH LESS THE MORE RECENT #METOO
MOVEMENT. 
WHY HAS THE SENATE DELAYED THIS 
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS? 
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
HOPE THAT NO MATTER HOW IT 
HAPPENS, THAT THEY WILL NOT 
FURTHER DO THAT. 
>> NANCY, FOR THE ANITA HILL 
SITUATION, THERE WAS AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION BUT HAVE THESE 
THINGS MOVED BACKWARDS? 
>> Reporter: FIRST OF ALL, THE 
SENATE DELAYS ON ALL KINDS OF 
THINGS. 
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE 
SPECIFICALLY PUTTING THIS OFF, 
IT'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS. 
IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE SENATE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN INTENT ON 
USING TIME ON THE FLOOR TO 
CONFIRM AS MANY JUDGES AS 
POSSIBLE BEFORE THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH 
EXTRANEOUS LEGISLATION GO TO 
THE SENATE FLOOR LIKE 
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CHANGE 
THE RULE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
REPORTING IN CONGRESS. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP A 
COUPLE OF DAYS ON THE SENATE 
FLOOR THAT THEY COULD BE USING 
TO CONFIRM ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE 
JUDGE. 
THEY WANT TO GET AS MUCH OF 
THAT DONE RIGHT NOW AS THEY 
CAN. 
BEYOND THAT, THERE IS A BIT OF 
SELF PROTECTION GOING ON AND 
THE WORRY THAT THEY WILL 
SOMEHOW GIVE UP TOO MUCH POWER 
FOR WOMEN AND MEN THAT MIGHT 
REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY A 
COLLEAGUE OR EVEN BY A MEMBER 
OF CONGRESS. 
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT FALSE 
REPORTS THAT CAN CREATE A 
LASTING STAIN ON ONE'S 
REPUTATION. 
SIMPLY PUT, THERE ARE A LOT OF 
SENATORS WHO HAVE PAID LIP 
SERVICE TO THE NOTION OF 
MODERNIZING THE RULES BUT IT IS 
NOT SOMETHING THAT THERE IS A 
LOT OF PASSION FOR, PARTICULARLY
AMONG A LOT OF THE OLDER MALE 
SENATORS. 
>> NANCY CORDES, OUR CHIEF 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT WHO 
SPENT THE BETTER PART OF AN 
HOUR WITH US BREAKING DOWN THE 
EXPLOSIVE NEWS FROM ATTORNEY 
MICHAEL AVENATTI, WE THANK YOU. 
THANK JOHN NOLAN FOR US, AS 
WELL. I 
KNOW YOU HAVE SOME BUSY HOURS 
AND WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE IT, 
NANCY. 
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. 
>>> A FEW MOMENTS AGO, MICHAEL 
AVENATTI WAS ON THE VIEW TALKING
ABOUT THE NEW CLAIMS AND SAID 
THAT HIS CLIENT IS READY TO 
TESTIFY. 
>> SHE IS WILLING TO TESTIFY 
AND WILLING TO MEET WITH THE FBI
FORTH WITH, IMMEDIATELY, TO 
DESCRIBE WHAT SHE WITNESSED. 
SHE IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL CORROBORATING 
WITNESS NAMES TO THE FBI 
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT 
INVESTIGATION AND WE ARE 
HOPEFUL THAT THE COMMITTEE IS 
GOING TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY BY 
CALLING FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
ALL OF THESE ALLEGATIONS CAN 
THEN BE PROPERLY VETTED AND THE 
TRUTH CAN BE KNOWN. 
>> ONE OF THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE DOES NOT RESPOND AND 
SAY THEY ARE GOING AHEAD WITH 
THE PLAN, WHICH IS TO HEAR THE 
TWO OF THEM TOMORROW AND THEN 
VOTE ON FRIDAY? 
WHAT HAPPENS THEN? 
>> WELL, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF 
OPTIONS AND I WANT TO EXPOSE 
WHAT THEY ARE AT THIS POINT IN 
TIME. 
WE HAVE PLANNED FOR THAT AND I 
WILL TELL YOU THAT I THINK THAT 
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS 
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. 
THERE SHOULD BE NO RUSH TO 
CONFIRM THIS MAN TO THE U.S. 
SUPREME COURT. 
DELAYING THIS MATTER A WEEK OR 
MONTH OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A 
MONTH WOULD BE OF NO 
CONSEQUENCE. 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
GET THIS RIGHT, 100% RIGHT, 
BEFORE A VOTE IS TAKEN ON THE 
CONFIRMATION FOR A LIFETIME TO 
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. 
>> THAT WAS ATTORNEY MICHAEL 
AVENATTI APPEARING ON THE VIEW 
EARLIER. 
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US ON 
CBSN, THE NEWS FROM MICHAEL 
AVENATTI. 
HE HAS REVEALED THE THIRD 
ACCUSER, THE THIRD PERSON TO BE 
ACCUSED. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, OF SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT. 
THIS IS THE TWEET FROM MR. 
KAVANAUGH -- EXCUSE ME -- FROM 
MR. AVENATTI ABOUT ONE HOUR 
AGO. 
IT READS, THIS IS A PICTURE OF 
MY CLIENT, JULIE SWETNICK. 
SHE IS COURAGEOUS AND BRAVE AND 
HONEST AND WE ASKED THAT HER 
PRIVACY BE RESPECTED. 
YOU JUST HEARD MR. AVENATTI ON 
THE VIEW SAYING HIS CLIENT IS 
READY TO TESTIFY. 
THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT SHE 
PROVIDED WHICH MR. AVENATTI 
PROVIDED TO THE MEMBERS OF THE 
MEDIA INCLUDES AN ALLEGATION 
AND I WILL READ IT BECAUSE I 
WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET MY 
LANGUAGE CORRECT. 
IT SAYS, IN PART, I ALSO 
WITNESSED EFFORTS BY MARK 
JUDGE, BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 
OTHERS TO CAUSE GIRLS TO BECOME 
INEBRIATED AND DISORIENTED SO 
THEY COULD BE GANG RAPED IN A 
SIDE ROOM OR BEDROOM BY A 
TRAIN. 
TRAIN IS IN QUOTES, OF NUMEROUS 
BOYS. 
I HAVE A FIRM RECOLLECTION OF 
SEEING BOYS LINED UP OUTSIDE 
MANY ROOMS THAT MANY OF THESE 
PARTIES WAITING FOR THEIR TURN 
WITH A GIRL INSIDE THE ROOM. 
THESE BOYS INCLUDED MARK JUDGE 
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
IN A PREPARED STATEMENT OF 
WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF MR. 
KAVANAUGH, IF THE HEARINGS 
HAPPEN TOMORROW, IT WILL BE ON 
THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
FOR PART OF THE TESTIMONY, IT 
SAYS SOMETIMES AND THIS IS 
QUOTING MR. KAVANAUGH AND HIS 
TESTIMONY FOR THE NOMINATION -- 
IT SAYS, QUOTE, SOMETIMES I HAD 
TOO MANY. 
IN RETROSPECT I SAID AND DONE 
THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT MAKE 
ME CRINGE NOW BUT THAT'S NOT 
WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. 
WHAT I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF IS 
FAR MORE SERIOUS THAN JUVENILE 
MISBEHAVIOR. 
I NEVER DID ANYTHING REMOTELY 
RESEMBLING WHAT DR. FORD 
DESCRIBES. 
ON THE PHONE WITH US IS ATTORNEY
JULIE RENDLEMAN AND ALSO WE 
HAVE CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, 
VINOO VARGHESE. 
FIRST, TO JULIE -- LET'S RESET 
AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR FOR OUR 
VIEWERS. I 
JUST READ ONE OF THE MORE 
EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS BY MS. 
SWETNICK IN THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT 
AND NOW WE HAVE THE PREPARED 
WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
HE'S ONLY ADDRESSING DR. FORD'S 
ALLEGATIONS. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHERE THIS 
GOES? 
>> THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK 
IS THAT IF YOU BELIEVE 
KAVANAUGH, IF YOU ARE ONE OF HIS
SUPPORTERS, WHAT'S WRONG WITH 
DOING A FURTHER INVESTIGATION 
TO VET THE TRUTHFULNESS OF 
THESE WITNESSES? 
IF THE POINT IS TO TRY TO 
GARNER THE TRUTH AND GET TO 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS, IN 
FACT, CORROBORATION OF THE 
WITNESS -- I'M SORRY -- THREE 
WITNESSES -- NOW IS THE TIME TO 
TAKE THE TIME TO DO A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE, IN 
FACT, OTHER WITNESSES AS THIS 
NEW VICTIM HAS SAID. 
WITNESSES OR INDIVIDUALS MAY 
HAVE WITNESSED OTHER 
INDIVIDUALS EITHER BEING 
ASSAULTED OR VERBALLY ABUSED OR 
ANY OF THOSE THINGS. 
WHAT REASON IN THE WORLD WITH A 
NOT PUT THIS ON HOLD? 
>> I WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE 
SOUND FRO MICHAEL AVENATTI. 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
SERIOUSNESS OF MAKING AN 
ACCUSATION LIKE THIS. 
LET'S PLAY THAT SOUND. 
>> SHE UNDERSTANDS THE MAGNITUDE
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS AND SHE 
DOES NOT MAKE THEM LIGHTLY. 
SHE HAS THOROUGHLY REVIEWED THE 
DECLARATIONS AND GONE OVER IT 
IN DETAIL AND SHE KNOWS EXACTLY 
WHAT IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE 
DECLARATION AND I'M LOOKING 
FORWARD TO AN INVESTIGATORY 
PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FOR THE 
TRUTH TO BE KNOWN. 
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DESERVES TO 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND ABOUT THE
CHARACTER, ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
LET ME ALSO SAY -- AND THEN I 
HAVE TO RUN -- BUT THERE'S NO 
EXCUSE, NO EXCUSE FOR THE 
COMMITTEE AND FOR BRETT 
KAVANAUGH NOT CALLING MARK JUDGE
TO TESTIFY FOR THE COMMITTEE. 
THIS IS A MAN THAT IS ONE OF 
THE CLOSEST FRIENDS OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AT THE TIME. 
AT ISSUE AND ALL YOU HAVE TO 
KNOW IS THAT THEY ARE HIDING 
HIM. 
THEY ARE HIDING MARK JUDGE FROM 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I CAN 
ASSURE YOU IF HE HAD POSITIVE 
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS TIME 
PERIOD AND POSITIVE THINGS TO 
SAY ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
CONDUCT, WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY 
HEARD FROM HIM. 
>> VINOO VARGHESE, YOU ARE A 
FORMER PROSECUTOR AND DEFENSE 
ATTORNEY AND YOU'VE BEEN ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THIS. 
IN REGARDS TO MARK JUDGE, MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MARK 
JUDGE MADE A STATEMENT IN THE 
COMMITTEE DIDN'T THINK HE COULD 
ADD VALUE TO HIS TESTIMONY, 
THAT IT WOULDN'T ADD VALUE SO 
THEY DIDN'T DEMAND THAT HE 
APPEAR IN FRONT OF THEM BUT 
NOW, WITH ALL OF THESE 
ACCUSATIONS, DO YOU AGREE WITH 
MICHAEL AVENATTI THAT THEY'VE 
GOT TO COUGH HIM UP AND MARK 
JUDGE NEEDS TO PRESENT HIMSELF 
FOR THE COMMITTEE? 
>> I'M NOT SURE IF HE DOES OR 
DOESN'T. 
IT POTENTIALLY COULD BE 
HELPFUL. 
HE'S BEING NAMED. 
IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY HELPFUL 
TO KAVANAUGH. 
I WOULD SAY THAT THE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE OBVIOUSLY SUCH 
A HORRIBLE NATURE. 
IT DOES WARRANT FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION. 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT HAS 
TO BE ORDERED BY THE PRESIDENT, 
BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND IS AN 
EXTENSION OF THE BACKGROUND 
CHECK, AS AN INVESTIGATION BY 
THE FBI AND WOULD BE A 
CONTINUATION FROM THE 
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT ALREADY 
HAPPEN. 
IN TERMS OF THE ALLEGATION, 
JUST BECAUSE MICHAEL AVENATTI 
SAYS THAT HE SIGNS THIS 
DECLARATION DOESN'T MAKE THE 
DECLARATION TRUE. 
JUST BECAUSE SHE SIGNED IT UNDER
PENALTY OF PERJURY DOESN'T MAKE 
IT TRUE. 
UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAS NOT 
BEEN SUBJECT TO CROSS-
EXAMINATION AND SOMETHING JULIE 
SAID EARLIER, SEVERAL MINUTES 
AGO, WHILE THIS ISN'T A 
CRIMINAL TRIAL, THE ALLEGATIONS 
ARE CRIMINAL. 
SO, IT'S MY BELIEF THAT IF YOU 
ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD ON A 
GUY OR DENY HIM A VOTE BECAUSE 
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, THEN 
THESE NEED TO BE VETTED 
PROPERLY AND HELD TO THE 
HIGHEST STANDARDS UNDER THE 
LAW. 
THAT IS BEYOND A REASONABLE 
DOUBT. 
THESE ARE EXPLICIT ALLEGATIONS 
AND YOU HAVE A MAN WHO HAS HAD 
SIX DIFFERENT FBI CHECKS 
RECENTLY. 
WHEN THESE THINGS COME OUT AT 
THE 11TH HOUR, THEY SHOULD BE 
VETTED, AND VIEWED WITH 
SUSPICION. 
I THINK KAVANAUGH SHOULD 
WELCOME AN FBI CHECK. 
>> HOLD ON, ONE SECOND. 
I JUST WANT TO -- 
>> THE ALLEGATIONS CAN BE 
PROVED TRUE THEN, AND THERE'S 
NO WAY THEY COULD THEN BE PROVED
FALSE. 
>> I WANT TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE 
BIT. 
TWO THINGS. 
THIS 11TH HOUR, WE SPOKE TO 
NANCY. 
THE 11TH HOUR IS UPON US 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE SENATE 
DECREED IS THE 11TH HOUR. 
THEY COULD TAKE THE TIME TO 
INVESTIGATE THESE AS MANY 
PEOPLE CALLED FOR. 
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT
A PERSON, A WOMAN, WOULD PUT 
THESE ALLEGATIONS OUT THERE AND 
NOT UNDERSTAND THE ENORMITY AND 
THE RISKS INVOLVED. 
GENERALLY, 70% OF WOMEN WHO WERE
SEXUALLY ABUSED DO NOT EVER 
REPORT IT. 
THEY NEVER REPORT IT EVEN WHEN 
FACED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
DO SO AT MUCH LATER TIMES IN 
THEIR LIFE. I 
THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL 
THAT WE AREN'T SUGGESTING THAT 
JUST BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING 
WHEN IT HAPPENS THAT WE WOULD 
SUGGEST THE ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT 
TRUE. 
I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE CAN MAKE 
THINGS UP AND THAT THERE ARE A 
LOT OF POLITICS INVOLVED BUT 
WHERE WE HAVE A TOWN WHERE WE 
DON'T SUGGESTED BECAUSE IT'S 
COMING OUT WHEN IT COMES OUT, 
THAT IT SOMEHOW MEANS IT DIDN'T 
HAPPEN OR THERE MIGHT BE SOME 
LEVEL OF TRUTH? 
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO QUESTION 
THE STATEMENT AND RIP IT APART 
AND WONDER ABOUT THE TIMING. 
SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SHE HAD 
AN UNDERSTANDING OR AWARENESS 
THAT THERE WERE CRIMES TAKING 
PLACE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND 
SHE ULTIMATELY BECAME A VICTIM 
OF THAT CRIME BUT NEVER CAME 
FORWARD AND THAT WILL BE ONE OF 
THE QUESTIONS, AND I PRESUME 
THAT YOU'VE BEEN A DEFENSE 
ATTORNEY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE 
QUESTIONS RAISED? 
>> LET ME JUST SAY -- WHEN YOU 
CITE STATISTICS LIKE THIS, YOU 
SAY THEY ARE STATISTICS, HOW 
COULD YOU PROVE WHEN IT 70% OF 
WOMEN, WHEN YOU USE THE TERM 
SEXUAL ASSAULT, THAT IS A TERM 
DEFINED IN THE PENAL LAW OF 
EACH STATE. 
THE ONLY WAY TO PROVE IT 
HAPPENED IS TO GO THROUGH THE 
PROCESS. 
WHEN I SEE THE 11TH HOUR, THE 
HEARINGS ENDED A WEEK AGO AND 
I'M NOT GETTING INTO THE 
POLITICS, BUT I DO BELIEVE THE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE SO SERIOUS THAT 
THEY REQUIRE FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION AND THERE SHOULD 
BE AN INVESTIGATION. 
WHAT I'M SAYING IS FROM LOOKING 
AT THIS, PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE A 
STEP BACK AND SHOULD NOT 
PRESUME THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 
GUILTY. 
THE NATURE OF THESE THINGS AND 
WHY WE HAVE STATUTES OF 
LIMITATION, WITNESSES 
DISAPPEAR. 
PEOPLE MAY NOT REMEMBER AND 
THAT IS WHY CRIMES NEED TO BE 
REPORTED. 
YOU CAN TAKE INTO EFFECT THAT 
THIS NATURE, PEOPLE MAY NOT 
REPORT IT RIGHT AWAY BUT THE 
FACT THAT THE FIRST ACCUSER, 
THAT SHE SPOKE TO HER THERAPIST 
IN 2012, IT DOESN'T MEAN BRETT 
KAVANAUGH DID THIS 35 YEARS 
AGO. 
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING I 
WANT TO STRESS. 
WE HAVE TO GIVE KAVANAUGH THE 
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. 
IT'S TO HIS BENEFIT TO HAVE THE 
FBI THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE. 
THERE WON'T BE A WAY TO PROVE 
OR DISPROVE THESE CLAIMS. 
YOU END UP WITH A STALEMATE 
REQUIRING FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> LET ME READ STATISTICS FROM 
THE NATIONAL NETWORK WHEN IT 
COMES TO REPORTS OF SEXUAL 
VIOLENCE CRIMES AND WHY PEOPLE 
GENERALLY DO NOT REPORT THEM. 
THESE ARE THE REASONS. 
23% FEAR RETALIATION, 13% 
BELIEVE THE POLICE WOULDN'T HELP
AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN A PERSONAL 
MATTER OR REPORTED TO A 
DIFFERENT OFFICIAL OR THAT IT 
WASN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO 
REPORT. 
MANY DIDN'T WANT TO GET THE 
PERPETRATOR IN TROUBLE, AND 30% 
DO NOT CITE A REASON. 
THE NOTION THAT BECAUSE THESE 
HAPPENED SO LONG AGO AND 
WEREN'T PRESENTED TO THE PROPER 
AUTHORITIES AT THE TIME AND 
THAT THEY ARE COMING OUT NOW, 
WHICH ANYBODY WHO HAS SPOKEN ON 
THIS SUBJECT IN THE LAST TWO 
WEEKS OR SO HAS UNDERSTOOD THAT 
IT'S INCREASINGLY POLITICAL, NO 
DOUBT ABOUT THAT. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS? 
>> I APPRECIATE WHEN YOU TALK 
ABOUT THIS PRESUMPTION, BUT 
THESE -- THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL 
CASE. 
THESE ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST 
HIM ARE NOT CRIMINAL, THEY ARE 
INDICATIONS THAT HE WAS A HEAVY 
DRINKER AND WAS DISRESPECTFUL 
TO WOMEN. 
EVEN IF WE IGNORE FOR ONE 
MOMENT THE CRIMINAL CHARGES OR 
EVEN IF WE ACCEPT THAT SOME OF 
THAT IS TRUE, THAT, IN AND OF 
ITSELF, BECOMES THE QUESTION OF 
WHETHER HE WILL SERVE AS A 
SUPREME COURT JUDGE. 
REMEMBER, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
CRIMINAL FOR THEM TO TAKE A VOTE
BASED ON THE FACT THAT AT SOME 
POINT IN HIS LIFE HE WAS 
DISRESPECTFUL TO WOMEN THAT IT 
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO 
MAKE A JUDGMENT NOW IN REGARD 
TO SUCH IMPORTANT THINGS AS 
REGARDS TO THE LAW. 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING 
HAPPENING 35 YEARS AGO, YES, ANY
TIME IN THE INN -- ANY 
INDIVIDUAL IN A CRIMINAL 
PROCESS COMES FORWARD AND MAKES 
AN ALLEGATION, NOT JUST ABOUT 
RAPE, BUT ABOUT ANY TYPE OF 
CRIME, IT IS THE JOB OF THE 
PROSECUTOR TO VET THAT WITNESS 
AND THAT CAN MAKE A 
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER 
THAT PERSON IS CREDIBLE. 
AS TO WHETHER THERE IS 
CORROBORATION OR IF THE 
INDIVIDUAL HAD A MENTAL 
DISORDER OR DISEASE THAT MAY 
CAUSE THEM NOT TO BE TRUTHFUL. 
OF COURSE THEY HAVE TO BE 
VETTED AND WE SHOULD EXPECT 
THAT THEY BE VETTED IN THIS 
SCENARIO. 
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE 
OBLIGATED, AT THIS STAGE, TO 
GIVE KAVANAUGH THE BENEFIT OF 
THE DOUBT. 
WE NOW HAVE THREE WITNESSES 
THAT HAVE COME FORWARD WHO HAVE 
MADE SWORN AFFIDAVITS AND THEY 
ARE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT IN 
WRITING AND WILLING TO BE CROSS-
EXAMINED. 
I'M NOT SURE AT THIS POINT HE'S 
ENTITLED TO THAT PRESUMPTION 
ANYMORE, NOT IN THIS SETTING. 
>> JULIE, WE KNOW THAT THE 
FEMALE PROSECUTOR WOULD BE HIRED
AND HER NAME IS RACHEL 
MITCHELL. 
I IMAGINE SHE IS FEROCIOUSLY 
REWRITING WHATEVER HER PLAN WAS 
IN TERMS OF QUESTIONING BOTH 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD. 
WHAT DO YOU SEE HER ROLE AS 
RIGHT NOW? 
HOW DICEY IS THIS MOVING 
FORWARD FOR HER? 
>> IT'S FUNNY AND I THINK WE 
CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT'S 
INTERESTING THAT THEY CHOSE A 
FEMALE PROSECUTOR AND THAT WAS 
PURPOSEFUL. 
WHEN WE THINK BACK TO ANITA 
HILL SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF 
MEN ASKING HER INAPPROPRIATE 
QUESTIONS, AS FAR AS I RECALL, 
IT WAS A CRINGE WORTHY MOMENT. 
THEY ARE CERTAINLY TRYING TO 
RESCUE IT BY BRINGING IN A 
FEMALE. 
FEMALE OR MAIL, THEY HAVE TO BE 
INCREDIBLY CAREFUL HOW THEY 
CROSS-EXAMINE THE INDIVIDUAL. 
IF IT'S TOO AGGRESSIVE, THEY 
WILL TURN OFF THE VIEWERS. 
THAT IS PEOPLE IN THE ROOM 
WATCHING. 
IF SHE IS ONE OF THOSE 
INDIVIDUALS THAT IS QUIET OR 
SOFT SPOKEN, IT MAY ACTUALLY BE 
TOO AGGRESSIVE AND THEY MAY LEND
CREDIBILITY TO WHAT SHE HAS TO 
SAY. 
THEY HAVE TO BE SUPER CAREFUL 
IN HOW THEY CROSS-EXAMINE THIS 
INDIVIDUAL. 
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIRING A 
WOMAN, BUT THE OBJECTS -- THEY 
DIDN'T WANT A GROUP OF OLDER MEN
GRILLING A SEXUAL ASSAULT 
VICTIM. 
I DON'T KNOW IF HIRING A WOMAN 
IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE MUCH OF 
A DIFFERENCE. 
QUITE POSSIBLY IT SENDS THE 
MESSAGE THAT THESE GROUP OF MEN 
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY IN A 
REASONABLE OR RESPONSIBLE OR 
COMPASSIONATE WAY, TO QUESTION 
THE VICTIM. 
>> I THINK THERE IS A LEVEL OF 
IT BEING TRANSPARENT TO PICK A 
WOMAN. 
NOT TO SEE A WOMAN CAN'T HANDLE 
THE JOB, I'M SURE SHE CAN. 
IF SHE'S TOO AGGRESSIVE, I 
DON'T THINK THE FIT WILL BE AS 
AN INCREDIBLY AGGRESSIVE CROSS-
EXAMINE HER, BUT ONE THAT KNOWS 
HOW TO LISTEN AND CALMLY BRING 
THE VICTIMS THROUGH THE CASE TO 
TRY TO POKE HOLES IN HER STORY, 
SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE 
INCREDIBLY, INCREDIBLY CAREFUL 
HOW SHE NAVIGATES THAT CROSS-
EXAMINATION. 
>> IT'S ALSO SURPRISING, AND 
WITH JULIE AND VINOO VARGHESE, 
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH THAT 
HAPPENED THAT WE'VE TALKED 
ABOUT. 
BUT I BELIEVE BOTH OF YOU 
SUGGESTED THAT IN LIGHT OF 
THESE RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF 
THIS ACCUSER, THAT YOU WOULD 
WANT TO HEAR FROM MARK JUDGE, 
WHO WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH'S BEST 
FRIEND IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE, HE IS 
NAMED AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS AWARE 
OF THE BEHAVIOR OF MR. 
KAVANAUGH. 
I WENT BACK TO LOOK AT THE NEW 
YORKER ARTICLE AND IT CAME OUT 
THIS WEEK WITH JANE MAYER AND 
THEY INTERVIEWED MR. JUDGE'S 
GIRLFRIEND AND IN ONE OF THE 
QUOTES, HER NAME WAS ELIZABETH 
RAZOR AND SHE DATED MARK JUDGE 
FOR THREE YEARS AND RECALLED 
THAT JUDGE HAD TOLD HER 
ASHAMEDLY OF AN INCIDENT 
INVOLVING HIM AND OTHER BOYS 
TAKING TURNS HAVING SEX WITH A 
DRUNK WOMAN. 
RAZOR SAID THE JUDGE REGARDED 
IT AS FULLY CONSENSUAL AND 
JUDGE DID NOT NAME OTHERS 
úINVO 
KNOWLEDGE THAT KAVANAUGH 
PARTICIPATED. 
BUT, WAS DISTURBED BY THE STORY 
AND NOTED THAT IT UNDERCUT IT 
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE SEXUAL 
INNOCENCE AT GEORGETOWN PREP, 
WHICH WAS WHERE BOTH HE AND 
BRETT KAVANAUGH WENT TO HIGH 
SCHOOL. 
DO YOU AGREE THAT YOU WOULD 
RECOMMEND TO THE SENATE THAT 
THEY HEAR FROM MR. JUDGE? 
>> I'M PROBABLY NOT AS 
INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM MR. 
JUDGE. I 
DON'T BELIEVE HE WILL TELL THE 
TRUTH. 
>> THAT'S INTERESTING. 
IN FRONT OF THE SCENT OF? 
HE COULD GO TO JAIL FOR LYING 
TO THE SENATE. 
>> YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 
IT'S DIFFICULT IN THIS SETTING 
TO DISPROVE WHAT HE WOULD SAY 
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE DNA 
EVIDENCE AND WE WON'T HAVE THOSE
THINGS THAT POTENTIALLY WE 
WOULD NEED TO PROVE THAT HE'S 
NOT FORTHRIGHT. I 
BELIEVE PART OF THE REASON HE 
ISN'T COMING IN IS BECAUSE HE 
DON'T -- HE DOESN'T THINK HE 
CAN TELL THE TRUTH. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I DON'T 
KNOW IF HE WILL MAKE OR BREAK 
THE CASE. 
AGAIN, WE GO BACK TO THE IDEA 
THAT IT SHOULD BE FURTHER 
VETTED AND WE SHOULDN'T BE 
RUSHING AND IF WE WERE ON TRIAL 
WITH THE CASE, WE WOULDN'T BE 
RUSHING TO TRY IT TOMORROW WHEN 
WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT AN 
ADDITIONAL COMPLAINANT COMING 
FORWARD TODAY. 
WE WOULD EXPECT WHEN THERE IS A 
DECISION OF THIS IMPORTANCE, 
WHEN YOU DETERMINE WHO WILL BE 
MAKING THESE DECISIONS FOR THE 
ENTIRE LIFETIME, THAT WE COULD 
GIVE IT A LITTLE TIME. 
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS 
HEARING FROM THE WITNESSES, THE 
ALLEGED VICTIMS IN THE CASE AND 
ANYONE THAT COULD CORROBORATE 
WHAT THEY SAY. 
IF REPUBLICANS -- IF MR. 
KAVANAUGH THINKS THAT MR. JUDGE 
CAN CREDIBLY COME IN AND VOTE 
FOR HIM, BY ALL MEANS, ONE 
WOULD THINK THEY'D WANT HIM TO 
BUT THEN HE WILL BE SUBJECT TO 
CROSS-EXAMINATION. 
>> I WANT TO READ A STATEMENT 
BY SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER, 
REPUBLICANS NEED TO IMMEDIATELY 
SUSPEND THE PROCEEDINGS RELATED 
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION 
AND THE PRESIDENT MUST ORDER 
THE FBI TO REOPEN THE 
BACKGROUND CHECK INVESTIGATION. 
THERE ARE NO MULTIPLE 
CORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH MADE úU 
THEY ALL DESERVE A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION. 
I STRONGLY BELIEVE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM 
CONSIDERATION. 
IF HE WILL NOT, AT THE VERY 
LEAST, THE HEARING AND THE VOTE 
SHOULD BE POSTPONED WHILE THE 
FBI INVESTIGATIONS THESE -- 
WHILE THE FBI INVESTIGATES. 
IF THEY PROCEED WITHOUT THE 
INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD BE A 
TRAVESTY FOR THE HONOR OF THE 
SUPREME COURT AND OUR COUNTRY. 
VINOO, YOU HAVE EXPRESSED THE 
ASCENSION THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY 
AND THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW. 
I HAVE TO WONDER. 
BECAUSE HE IS TRYING TO BE A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND NOT 
ANYTHING ELSE, PERHAPS -- 
>> HE WOULD GO BACK TO HIS LIFE 
IF HE WITHDRAWS. 
>> I WONDER IF YOU WOULD BE 
ABLE TO GO BACK TO BEING A 
JUDGE. 
BUT THE PRESUMPTION OF 
INNOCENCE IS ALWAYS THERE, THE 
FACT THAT HE IS ATTEMPTING TO 
BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE 
SENSITIVE? 
>> I AGREE WITH THAT. 
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND, A 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. 
UNDERSTAND HE ALREADY HAS A 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AS A COURT 
OF APPEALS JUDGE IN D.C.. 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE ZENITH OF 
A LAWYER, TO BE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
I'M NOT SAYING -- I DON'T 
BELIEVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD 
WITHDRAW HIS NOMINATION. 
HOWEVER, I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS 
WARRANTS FURTHER FBI 
INVESTIGATION. WHILE JULIE AND I
AGREE IT'S NOT A CRIMINAL CASE, 
HE IS BEING ACCUSED OF CRIMES 
WITH THIS ALLEGATION THAT HE 
WAS INVOLVED, POTENTIALLY, IN A 
TRAIN AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 
PEOPLE. 
>> WE SHOULD CLARIFY BECAUSE IN 
HER STATEMENT SHE SAID THAT SHE 
HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND 
MARK JUDGE AND BRETT KAVANAUGH 
WERE PRESENT. 
SHE DOESN'T ACCUSE THEM OF 
ASSAULTING HER. 
SHE SAID SHE WAS AWARE OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULTS GOING ON INSIDE 
ROOMS OR BEDROOMS. 
SHE DIDN'T SAY SHE WITNESSED 
THEM BUT SHE SAW YOUNG MEN 
LINING UP TO TAKE THEIR TURN 
AND IN THAT LINEUP SHE OFTEN 
SAW BRETT KAVANAUGH AND MARK 
JUDGE. 
>> WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE 
KAVANAUGH OF MR. KAVANAUGH. 
WE HAVE A SOURCE WITHIN THE 
WHITE HOUSE THAT TWEETED THIS 
EARLIER. 
HE SAID, THE WHITE HOUSE IS 
SHOCKED BY AVENATTI CLAIMS. 
PRIVATELY, THEY ARE SAYING THIS 
COULD BE THE END OF THE LINE FOR
KAVANAUGH FOR OUTSIDE ADVISOR. 
THIS IS COMING FROM GABRIEL 
SHERMAN, REPORTER FOR VANITY 
FAIR. 
MICHAEL AVENATTI RESPONDED AND 
SAID, THIS SHOWS HOW 
INCOMPETENT THE WHITE HOUSE IS. 
THEY MUST NOT HAVE BEEN PAYING 
ATTENTION THE LAST SEVEN 
MONTHS. 
I GUESS THEIR CHIEF SOURCE OF 
NEWS IS FOX NEWS. 
THE ASSERTION BY GABRIEL 
SHERMAN AND TALKING TO HIS 
SOURCES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, 
JULIE, IS THAT EVEN THOUGH 
AVENATTI HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
THIS AND IT APPEARED ON 
TELEVISION TO TEASE THE NEWS 
THAT HE HAD MADE CONTACT WITH A 
THIRD ACCUSER, THEY ARE STILL 
SHOCKED BY THIS AND THE 
THINKING ACCORDING TO GABE IS 
ú 
SINKS THIS POTENTIAL NOMINEE. 
>> THERE IS A TIME WHEN IT'S 
TIME TO CUT YOUR LOSSES AND ONE 
QUESTION AT THIS POINT, ONE MAY 
WONDER IF IT IS THAT TIME. 
REMEMBER, IF THEY PUSH THIS TOO 
HARD AND THESE WITNESSES COME 
IN AND THEY ARE CREDIBLE AND 
KAVANAUGH IS NOT, IT HURTS THEM 
NOT JUST IN THIS SITUATION, BUT 
WHO THE NEXT CHOICE IS. 
THEY MAY SAY WE DON'T WANT TO 
PUT THESE WMEN THROUGH IT AND 
WE CAN'T STAND BEHIND A PERSON 
EVEN IF WE WERE TO ACCEPT THE 
MOST SEVERE CHARGES, THAT IT 
WOULD BE SO INAPPROPRIATE AND 
MISGUIDED ON THE TREATMENT OF 
WOMEN DURING THAT PERIOD OF 
TIME THAT WE WON'T STAND BE -- 
BESIDE HIM. 
>> FROM ALL THIS PLAYING OUT, 
IT FEELS THAT THIS IS GOING TO 
PLAY OUT IN COURT ROOMS AND IN 
DISTRICTS ALL ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. 
IF THESE ALLEGATIONS MADE 
AGAINST MR. KAVANAUGH, HOWEVER 
IT TURNS OUT, WOULD THIS MAKE 
BOTH OF YOUR JOBS HARDER IF YOU 
ARE A PROSECUTOR AND YOU HAVE 
SOMEBODY NOT GOING AFTER 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BEING 
THAT WOULD SUGGEST A SCHOOL 
SUPERINTENDENT OR SOMEBODY WHO 
IS A STATE SENATOR, IF THEY DID 
SOMETHING WHEN IT WAS 10-15-25 
YEARS AGO? 
IN THIS ERA, DOES THAT EMPOWER 
MORE WOMEN TO COME FORWARD? 
OR DOES IT -- AS WE POINT OUT 
EARLIER, SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S 
SO MUCH HEAT AND SCRUTINY AND 
ATTENTION ON THIS FROM THE 
MEDIA AND FROM OTHERS AND FROM 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE POLITICAL 
AGENDAS, THAT THIS MAY CONTINUE 
TO DRIVE FOLKS WHO FEEL THEY 
HAVE A STORY TO TELL TO NOT 
TELL THAT STORY TO LAWYERS? 
>> IT MAKES BOTH SIDES MORE 
DIFFICULT. 
THE PROSECUTOR, IF WE THINK 
ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN, WHAT 
OCCURRED OR WHAT DIDN'T OCCUR, 
AND MAY HAVE AMOUNTED TO HIM 
GETTING ARRESTED NOW AND 
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
BEING ASKED AS TO WHY THE BALL 
WAS DROPPED. 
THE JOB OF THE PROSECUTOR'S IS 
NOT TO NOT ARREST BUT TO MAKE 
THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHEN 
WITNESSES ARE CREDIBLE, IF THEY 
ARE, IF THEY BELIEVE THERE IS A 
CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST THEM, AS 
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, I'M SURE IT 
MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT IN 
CERTAIN WAYS BECAUSE WHEN YOU 
HAVE A LESS HIGH-POWERED CLIENT 
BEING ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, IF 
YOU ARE CONCERNED THE 
PROSECUTOR WOULD TREAT THOSE 
CASES, THAT THEY TREATED LESS 
SERIOUSLY BEFORE OR MORE 
SERIOUSLY NOW. 
OBVIOUSLY, AS A DEFENSE 
ATTORNEY, YOU DON'T WANT THAT. 
YOU WANT THE CASES RESOLVED THE 
WAY THEY USED TO BE BECAUSE 
THAT'S YOUR JOB AS A DEFENSE 
ATTORNEY. 
IT'S MAKING BOTH SIDES A LITTLE 
MORE CONSCIENTIOUS AND A LITTLE 
BIT MORE CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE 
JOBS REALLY ARE. 
>> WE HAVE THE LATEST STATEMENT 
FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH AND IT'S 
OBVIOUSLY BRIEF. 
THE QUOTE FROM THE JUDGE IS 
THAT THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND 
FROM THE TWILIGHT ZONE. I 
DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS AND THIS 
NEVER HAPPENED. 
>> WHO THIS IS, ACCORDING TO 
THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT, IS A HIGH 
RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO 
HAS HELD THE FOLLOWING -- ENTRY 
POINTS OUT INACTIVE -- BUT TOP 
SECRET CLEARANCES FOR THE U.S. 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE, THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY AS WELL IS CUSTOMS AND 
BORDER PROTECTION. 
THE FACT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
COMES OUT WITH A STATEMENT 
UNEQUIVOCAL, THIS IS RIDICULOUS 
AND FROM THE TWILIGHT ZONE, I 
DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS IN THIS 
NEVER HAPPENED, HOW EASY OR 
HARD WILL IT BE TO PROVE THAT 
-- THAT HE ACTUALLY KNEW HER OR 
DIDN'T KNOW HER? 
>> WHEN I SEE THIS NEVER 
HAPPENED, THE FIRST THING THAT 
COMES UP, WHICH THIS? 
THERE'S SO MANY ALLEGATIONS IN 
HER STATEMENT THAT HE SAID 
DIDN'T HAPPEN AND OTHERS HAVE 
SAID DID. 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW --
>> LET'S GO WITH DRINKING 
EXCESSIVELY. 
HE SAID IT NEVER HAPPEN. 
NOT THESE ACCUSERS BUT OTHERS 
SUGGESTED THAT HE WAS A HEAVY 
DRINKER. 
'S ATTORNEY APPEARED ON HERE 
THIS MORNING AND SAID THERE ARE 
OTHERS WHO SAY HIS EXACTLY AS 
HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF ON FOX 
NEWS. I 
WONDER, AS A PROSECUTOR AND A 
CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, HOW 
HARD OR EASY WOULD IT BE TO 
DISPROVE THIS, I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE THIS PERSON IS? 
>> I THINK IT WILL BE VERY 
DIFFICULT TO PROVE OR DISPROVE 
THESE ALLEGATIONS. 
>> THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW HER? 
>> HOW WILL THEY PROVE THAT? 
HE WENT TO AN ALL BOYS SCHOOL. 
HE MAY HAVE BEEN AT A PARTY 
WITH HER, WHO KNOWS? 
I UNDERSTAND WHY KAVANAUGH 
MAKES THESE STATEMENTS AND HE'S 
ALL IN, AND REPUBLICANS ARE ALL 
IN. 
HE'S MAKING THIS STATEMENT AND 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 
DIFFICULT. 
THIS IS WHERE I THINK THE 
SENATE SHOULD TAKE A BREAK AND 
SET UP NEW HEARINGS AND CONDUCT 
THE INVESTIGATION. 
AT THIS POINT, IT'S STUPID NOT 
TO AND I GET THE POLITICAL 
REASONS FOR GOING FORWARD BUT 
ULTIMATELY, THEY ARE GOING TO 
SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT. 
IF THEY DON'T VENT THESE THINGS 
AND IT GOES TO THE SUPREME 
COURT, THERE WILL BE PAYBACK IN 
THE LONG RUN. 
>> THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT 
WANTING HIM ON THE SUPREME 
COURT BEFORE IT BEGINS, THE 
TERM BEGINS BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY BEFORE THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
AS WE GO FORWARD, AND WE TALKED 
ABOUT THIS EARLIER, THERE WILL 
BE A CAVEAT ASSOCIATED WITH HIS 
NAME. 
THESE ARE PROBABLY THE MOST 
SCANDALOUS AND EXPLOSIVE 
ALLEGATIONS IN REGARD TO THE 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE THAT I 
HAVE EVER HEARD. 
>> BY ALMOST ANY BUDDY-BUDDY -- 
BY ALMOST ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC 
EYE. 
>> BEING A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, 
WE'VE GOT THIS STATEMENT THAT 
IS A COUPLE OF SENTENCES BUT 
HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE A CLIENT. 
DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL? 
>> THAT COULD BE A COURSE OF 
ACTION YOU TAKE BUT THIS ISN'T A
NORMAL SITUATION. 
JULIE AND I AGREE THAT IT'S NOT 
A CRIMINAL CASE. 
DOING AN INVESTIGATION, WE TELL 
CLIENTS IF THEY COME TO US EARLY
ENOUGH, NOT TO SAY ANYTHING IN 
THE INVESTIGATION TAKES ITS 
COURSE, WE MAY PROVIDE 
ASSISTANCE TO PROSECUTORS AND 
THEY WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT 
SITUATION. 
AT THIS POINT, HE SHOULD EITHER 
WITHDRAW OR GO 100% AHEAD. 
HE'S CHOOSING 100% AHEAD AND 
ACTUALLY, THEY HAVE TO DO THIS 
FOR THE INVESTIGATION, TO DO 
THE BACKGROUND AND ALLOW THESE 
PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD. 
WHAT MAY ULTIMATELY HAPPEN IS 
THAT WHEN THE PEOPLE TESTIFY, 
THEY MAY NOT APPEAR CREDIBLE 
AND THIS IS WHERE THE 
PROSECUTOR THAT HAS BEEN HIRED 
BY THE REPUBLICANS -- I THINK 
SHE SHOULD GO HARD ON EVERYONE 
AND TAKE THAT POSITION. 
THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE TO BE 
VETTED AND THERE'S NO REASON TO 
GO AROUND THIS. 
WE SHOULDN'T TREAT PEOPLE 
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THEIR 
GENDER. 
IF THEY MAKE AN ACCUSATION OF 
THIS MAGNITUDE, THEY SHOULD BE 
SUBJECTED TO WHATEVER THE CROSS-
EXAMINATION IS FOR ANY WITNESS 
WHO MAKES AN ALLEGATION, THAT 
THEY WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO. 
IF THAT'S TOO DELICATE, THAT 
DOESN'T SERVE THE PURPOSE. 
IF THE OBJECTION IS TO GET TO 
THE TRUTH, WHATEVER THAT IS, 
HOWEVER YOU DO THAT, YOU SHOULD 
DO THAT. 
THINK THEY SHOULD ALL BE 
SUBJECTED. 
AT THE END OF THIS, THERE 
SHOULD BE AN ACCOUNTING. 
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT 
SUPPORT HER POSITION AND THESE 
ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD 
DO TO GET THESE PLUSES AND 
MINUSES AND THEN THE 
REPUBLICANS WOULD MAKE THE 
DETERMINATION OF IF THERE ARE 
MORE PLUSES AND MINUSES. 
AT THIS POINT I WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IF THERE IS A PAUSE. 
THIS SHOULD BE AT THE VERY 
LEAST. 
>> IN THE AFFIDAVIT, MS. 
SWETNICK SAYS THIS IN PARAGRAPH 
13 -- IN APPROXIMATELY 1982, I 
BECAME THE VICTIM OF ONE OF 
THESE, QUOTE, GANG OR, QUOTE, 
TRAIN RAPES WHERE MARK JUDGE 
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH WERE 
PRESENT. 
SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT, I 
SHARED WITH WHAT TRANSPIRED 
WITH AT LEAST TWO OTHER PEOPLE 
AND DURING THE INCIDENT I WAS 
INCAPACITATED WITHOUT MY 
CONSENT AND UNABLE TO FIGHT OFF 
THE BOYS RAPING ME. I 
BELIEVE I WAS DRUGGED USING 
QUAALUDES OR SOMETHING SIMILAR 
PLACED IN WHAT I WAS DRINKING. 
THE REASON I HIGHLIGHT THAT 
PARAGRAPH IS BECAUSE, AS ANN 
MURRAY POINTED OUT AND WE'VE 
BEEN DISCUSSING, IT DOES NOT 
SAY THAT MARK JUDGE AND BRETT 
KAVANAUGH PARTICIPATED, BUT 
THAT THEY WERE THERE. 
SHE SAID SHE WAS DRUGGED, 
UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT AND 
UNABLE TO FIGHT OFF THE BOYS 
THAT WERE RAPING HER AND SHE 
BELIEVES -- AND THIS IS HER 
ASSERTION -- THAT SHE WAS 
DRUGGED USING EITHER QUAALUDES 
OR SOMETHING ELSE PLACED IN 
WHAT SHE WAS DRINKING. 
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD IF 
YOU ARE CROSS-EXAMINING HER AND 
YOU ARE THE PERSON THE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE CHOSEN TO 
EXAMINE AND TO TALK TO, FOR DR. 
FORD, HOW DO TAKE THAT 
PARAGRAPH AND WHAT TO SAY TO 
SOMEONE WHO SAID THEY WERE A 
VICTIM IN INCAPACITATED AND 
DRUGGED? 
THEY REMEMBER TWO INDIVIDUALS 
BEING THERE BUT THAT IS ALL 
THEY HAVE TO GO ON AND IT 
HAPPENED 30 PLUS YEARS AGO? 
>> LET'S BE CLEAR. 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE GO 
ABOUT CROSS-EXAMINING A FEMALE, 
NO MATTER WHO IT IS, THE 
RELEVANCE ISN'T WHETHER IT IS 
MALE OR FEMALE, BUT YOU HAVE TO 
KNOW, AS A PROSECUTOR AND 
DEFENSE ATTORNEY, WHO THE 
WITNESS IS. 
WHO THAT WITNESS IS, AND HOW 
THEY WILL PORTRAY THEMSELVES 
AND HOW THEY WILL BEHAVE 
WEATHER ON THE STAND OR IN A 
HEARING DICTATES HOW YOU CROSS-
EXAMINE THEM. 
YOU CAN BE AGGRESSIVE WITH A 
WITNESS WITHOUT YELLING AT THEM 
AND WITHOUT INSULTING THEM. 
AS WE KNOW FROM PRIOR HEARINGS, 
A LOT OF ATTORNEYS AND NON-
ATTORNEYS DON'T KNOW HOW THE 
HECK TO GET SOMEONE OR CROSS-
EXAMINE THEM THE RIGHT WAY. 
SHE HAS TO KNOW HOW TO TOE THE 
LINE. 
BEING TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH 
CERTAIN WITNESSES CAN BACKFIRE 
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS, 
OBVIOUSLY, THE QUESTIONS TO ASK 
ARE NOT JUST ABOUT THAT DAY, BUT
THAT PERIOD OF TIME. 
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DETERMINE 
WHY SHE DIDN'T COME FORWARD AND 
WHO SHE TOLD AND WHAT 
SURROUNDED HER AT THAT TIME. 
THE PROBLEM THE CROSS EXAMINER 
WILL HAVE IS A LOT OF THE 
QUESTIONS SHE ASKED MAY GIVE 
ANSWERS THAT WILL HURT HER. 
FOR EXAMPLE, IF I SAY, WHO DID 
YOU TELL AND SHE NAMES TWO 
PEOPLE, POTENTIALLY, YOU HAVE 
TWO WITNESSES THAT WILL ARGUABLY
CORROBORATE WHAT SHE SAID AND 
YOU ARE HURTING YOUR CASE WHEN 
YOU DO THAT EXAMINATION. 
IT IS NOT AN EASY CROSS-
EXAMINATION. I 
DON'T ENVY HER. 
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T MIND DOING 
IT BUT ITS GOING TO BE TOUGH. 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE STIGMA 
REGARDING JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WHEN 
I TALK ABOUT JUDGE THOMAS TO MY 
CHILDREN, THE FIRST THING THAT 
COMES TO MIND, AND THE 
ALLEGATIONS WERE NOT AS 
SERIOUS, WAS A COKE CAN. 
THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT EVERY 
TIME. 
JUST IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
IF KAVANAUGH BECAME A SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE. 
>> CAN I ASK, WHAT SHOULD WE, 
THE PUBLIC, BE LOOKING FOR WHEN 
WE WATCH THE CROSS-EXAMINATION. 
NOT BY MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE WILL BE A 
LEVEL OF POLITICS, BUT FROM 
THIS PERSON THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY 
MEANT TO BE BIPARTISAN OR 
NEUTRAL, BUT SHOULD WE LOOK FOR 
AND TO YOUR POINT, SHE CAN BE 
TOUGH. 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE EXPECTS 
HER TO NOT BE TOUGH BUT WHAT 
SHOULD WE LOOK FOR AS WE LISTEN 
TO HER AND HER QUESTIONS AND 
PROBING TO INDICATE THAT SHE IS 
BEING FAIR? 
WHAT WOULD BE A RED FLAG TO 
SUGGEST SHE IS NOT BEING FAIR. 
TO EITHER DR. FORD OR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
JULIE? 
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, VINOO, 
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ONE? 
>> I WILL GO. 
I THINK THE PROSECUTOR THAT IS 
GOING TO DO THE QUESTIONING, 
SHE'S GOT TO GATHER 
INFORMATION. 
THAT IS PART OF IT. 
JULIE RAISES A GOOD POINT THAT 
THERE MAY BE OTHER PEOPLE THAT 
YOU TALKED TO. 
THIS IS A TOUGH POSITION FOR 
THE PROSECUTOR. 
MOST OF THE TIME, THE 
PROSECUTORS HAVE HAD BACKGROUND 
INFORMATION AND IT DOESN'T 
APPEAR THEY WILL HAVE THAT 
OPPORTUNITY HERE. 
WHAT THEY WILL LOOK FOR IS 
EVASIVENESS, THE ABILITY TO 
ANSWER QUESTIONS, DIRECT 
QUESTIONS. 
WHY DIDN'T SHE GO FORWARD? 
WHERE WERE YOU DURING THIS 
PERIOD WHEN HE WAS UP FOR 
SENATE CONFIRMATION AND BECAME 
A JUDGE AS A CIRCUIT COURT 
JUDGE? 
I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE. 
THERE HAVE BEEN SIX FBI 
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT 
KAVANAUGH HAS GONE THROUGH 
PREVIOUSLY. 
YOU'VE GOT TO RE-EXAMINE THOSE 
CHECKS. 
I DON'T THINK REPUBLICANS OR 
DEMOCRATS SHOULD PROCEED WITHOUT
RE-EXAMINING THOSE CHECKS. 
DID THESE PEOPLE COME INTO THE 
CROSSHAIRS OF THE FBI 
PREVIOUSLY? 
WERE THEY EVER QUESTION? 
OR, WERE PEOPLE AROUND THEM 
QUESTION? 
IF PEOPLE AROUND THEM WERE 
QUESTIONED AND THERE WAS NO 
ALLEGATIONS OF THIS WAY BACK 
WHEN, AND PRESUMABLY THERE 
WASN'T BECAUSE IT NEVER CAME UP 
WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED TO BE THE 
D.C. CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE, IF 
THEY WERE NEARBY OR AVAILABLE 
TO BE QUESTION, WHY DIDN'T THIS 
COME UP EARLIER? 
THE QUESTION IS, WHY DIDN'T IT 
COME UP? 
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
FOR 30 YEARS? 
LISTEN, THERE CAN BE SYMPATHY TO
A POINT BUT IT HAS TO BE VETTED 
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT 
EVERYTHING AROUND IT AND WHY 
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION IS 
THERE AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. 
>> RACHEL MITCHELL WILL ALSO 
QUESTION JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
TYPICALLY, ONE OF THE HALLMARKS 
OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS IS THAT 
TYPICALLY THE JUDGE IS SOMEWHAT 
EVASIVE AND THEY ARE VAGUE 
ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND ON HOT 
BUTTON ISSUES. 
HE WAS PARTICULARLY SKILLFUL 
AND THAT WON'T FLY, RIGHT? 
>> I DON'T THINK HE WILL BE 
VAGUE. 
IF HE'S VAGUE HERE, HE'S DONE. 
I THINK HE WILL BE UNEQUIVOCAL 
HERE, AS HE HAS BEEN IN HIS 
QUOTES. I 
WOULD BE SHOCKED IF IT GETS TO 
THAT POINT. 
I THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING 
ON FOR THIS TO CONTINUE. 
>> LET ME READ THE TWEET FROM 
THE PRESIDENT. 
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED A MINUTE 
AGO. 
MICHAEL AVENATTI IS A THIRD-
RATE LAWYER WHO IS GOOD AT 
MAKING FALSE ACCUSATIONS LIKE 
HE DID ON ME AND LIKE HE IS NOW 
DOING ON JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
HE IS JUST LOOKING FOR 
ATTENTION AND DOESN'T WANT 
PEOPLE TO LOOK AT HIS PAST 
RECORD AND RELATIONSHIPS, A 
TOTAL LOW LIFE. 
OKAY. 
THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 
RESPONSE, THUS FAR. 
JULIE, YOU WERE GOING TO PICK 
IT UP? 
>> I HOPE TO GOSH I DON'T HAVE 
TO RESPOND TO THAT. 
>> THAT'S OKAY. 
>> IT ONLY SEEKS TO CONFOUND. 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE 
LOOKING FOR, REMEMBER THAT ANY 
TIME YOU ARE CROSS-EXAMINING 
SOMEONE, YOU ARE NEUTRAL AND 
LOOKING TO CATCH THEM IN A 
LIVE. 
WEATHER FOR POLITICAL REASONS 
OR THAT YOU ARE PROSECUTORS WHO 
BELIEVE SOMEONE IS GUILTY OR 
NOT GUILTY, YOU HAVE AN AGENDA 
WHEN YOU CROSS-EXAMINE SOMEONE. 
I'M NOT SURE THAT THE MOST 
IMPORTANT AND PRESSING ISSUE IS 
WHY SHE DIDN'T COME FORWARD 
SOONER. 
THE PRESSING ISSUE IS HER 
ABILITY TO REMEMBER OR NOT 
REMEMBER. 
WAS SHE DRINKING? 
THESE ARE QUESTIONS YOU WILL 
WANT TO ASK BECAUSE IF SHE'S 
DRINKING, DOES THAT IMPAIR HER 
ABILITY TO REMEMBER? 
THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WILL BE 
RELEVANT TO DETERMINE WHETHER 
SHE GOT IT RIGHT IN HER 
RECOLLECTION OF WHAT OCCURRED. I
THINK THE SECOND ISSUE IS BIAS. 
IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE 
NATURE OF HER RELATIONSHIP WITH 
HIM OR HER POLITICAL VIEWS THAT 
MAY IMPACT HER ABILITY TO BE 
FULLY HONEST? 
THE MINUTE YOU START GOING DOWN 
THE ROAD OF SAYING SHE DIDN'T 
COME FORWARD, AS SUGGESTED, THIS
ISN'T SYMPATHY. 
THERE ARE FACTS THAT WE'VE 
TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF 
STATISTICALLY WHY INDIVIDUALS 
DON'T COME FORWARD AND WE SAW 
IT IN BILL COSBY, HARVEY 
WEINSTEIN AND IN THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH. 
THAT IS NOT ABOUT SYMPATHY, 
IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE 
DON'T COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF 
THREAT OF RETALIATION, 
EMBARRASSMENT AND THE LIKE. 
IT'S FUNNY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT 
IT. 
I WAS SPEAKING TO A FAMILY 
MEMBER THE OTHER DAY AND FOR 
THE FIRST TIME I BROUGHT UP 
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO ME. 
IT DIDN'T COME INTO MY MIND. 
IT ALL STARTED TO HAPPEN AND IT 
SURE AS HECK HAPPENED BUT IT'S 
NOT SOMETHING I BROUGHT UP 
UNTIL THIS STARTED COMING 
STARTED COMING UP. 
>> ANNE-MARIE JUST READ THE 
TWEET FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
IT READS AVENATTI IS A THIRD 
RATE LAWYER GOOD AT MAKING FALSE
ACCUSATIONS LIKE HE DID ON ME 
AND LIKE HE IS DOING ON JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
LETS REMIND THE VIEWERS THAT ON 
AUGUST 21, THE PRESIDENT'S 
LAWYER, MICHAEL COHEN, REACHED 
A PLEA DEAL WITH FEDERAL 
PROSECUTORS INTO THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE $130,000 
PAYMENT TO STORMY DANIELS AND 
THE PAYMENT TO KAREN MCDOUGAL. 
BOTH HAVE SAID THEY HAD AFFAIRS 
WITH DONALD TRUMP AND IN 
PLEADING GUILTY, MR. COHEN 
IMPLICATED PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP TELLING THE COURT THAT HE 
PAID OFF STORMY DANIELS AT THE 
DIRECTION -- QUOTING FROM THAT 
PLEA DEAL, AT THE DIRECTION OF 
THE CANDIDATE FOR THE PRINCIPAL 
PURPOSE OF INFLUENCING THE 
ELECTION. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PART OF THE 
FALSE ACCUSATION THE PRESIDENT 
IS TALKING ABOUT. 
IN TERMS OF WHAT HE SAID, LIKE 
HE DID ON ME -- WE WANTED TO 
POINT THAT OUT. 
>> WE ARE GETTING DOWN TO THE 
BOTTOM OF THE HOUR. 
JULIE RENDLEMAN AND VINOO 
VARGHESE, WE THANK YOU FOR 
SPENDING TIME WITH US TALKING 
ABOUT THIS. 
THIS DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE 
INTO THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS 
AND WE WILL EXPECT AT LEAST TO 
HEAR FROM THE SENATE. 
WE KNOW THEY ARE LOOKING INTO 
THE AFFIDAVIT THAT MR. AVENATTI 
HAS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND 
DEMOCRATS ARE RESPONDING. 
WE HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM 
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY AND SOME OTHER
REPUBLICANS. 
THIS IS NOT OVER BY A LONGSHOT 
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT 
TOMORROW WILL BRING. 
>> IT'S SO TRUE. 
THE STATEMENT FROM BRETT 
KAVANAUGH SAYING IT'S THE 
TWILIGHT ZONE AND NOTHING LIKE 
THIS HAPPENED, IT GIVES US A 
LITTLE BIT OF AN INKLING AS TO 
WHAT WE WILL SEE. 
HE SEEMS TO BE DOUBLING DOWN.

RESOURCE, ITS PEOPLE. 
THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGN OF EXODUS 
IS THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS THAT 
HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN ACROSS THE 
ISLAND.
