1
00:00:01,237 --> 00:00:02,839
SUCCESSFUL RELAUNCH AS HOWIE

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:03,473
KURTZ SAID.

3
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:04,574
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON TOP OF

4
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:06,710
THE WORLD.

5
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,445
>> TWITTER IS A FACT IS A

6
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,347
LESSER VERSION OF YOU.

7
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:12,182
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE.

8
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:13,683
WHEN YOU GO ON TWITTER, YOU

9
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:15,385
ARE NEVER AS GOOD AS YOU ARE

10
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,587
AS A NORMAL PERSON.

11
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:18,455
I SAY THAT ABOUT MYSELF.

12
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:20,324
I DON’T LIKE WHO I AM ON

13
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:20,691
TWITTER.

14
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:23,227
IF YOU COMBINE A BUNCH OF

15
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:24,328
VARIABLES, WHETHER YOU ARE

16
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,896
DRINKING -- I ASSUME MIGHT BE

17
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:26,363
THE CASE.

18
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:27,631
BECAUSE WHAT SHE SAID WAS SO

19
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:28,365
HORRIBLE AND CRAZY.

20
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:32,503
BUT REALLY, TWITTER HAS BECOME

21
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:33,170
GLOBAL H.R.

22
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,705
IT USED TO BE IT WAS THE

23
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,373
CHRISTMAS PARTY THAT RUINED

24
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:36,640
YOU.

25
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,242
THAT IS HOW YOU LOST YOUR JOB.

26
00:00:38,242 --> 00:00:41,345
NOW YOU CAN DESTROY YOUR OWN

27
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:44,081
CAREER BY GOING ON TO THIS

28
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:46,450
GLOBAL H.R., SAYING SOMETHING

29
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,551
COMPLETELY REPUGNANT AND THE

30
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:48,986
NEXT DAY YOU DON’T JUST LOSE

31
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:51,589
YOUR JOB BUT EVERYBODY YOU

32
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:53,090
LOSE WITH LOSES THEIR JOB.

33
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,158
MAKE YOU WAKE UP IN THE

34
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:55,326
MORNING AND YOU DON’T REMEMBER

35
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:55,960
YOU DID IT.

36
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,694
IT’S INTERESTING.

37
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:58,029
THERE IS SOMETHING ALSO ABOUT

38
00:00:58,029 --> 00:00:58,396
COMEDIANS.

39
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:00,464
THEY ARE IN A NEW WORLD.

40
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:01,365
COMEDIANS EVERY TIME THEY

41
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,500
TALK, THEY ARE JUMPING OFF A

42
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:02,867
CLIFF.

43
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:05,269
THAT IS KIND OF HOW THEY

44
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:05,570
THINK.

45
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,504
THEY LIKE THAT IDEA.

46
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:07,605
>> Dana: THEY NEED TO HAVE

47
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:08,272
NO FEAR.

48
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:08,606
>> YES.

49
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,441
SO WHETHER IT’S ROSEANNE OR I

50
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,443
WOULD SAY HER LEFT WING

51
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:14,245
OPPOSITE WHICH IS ALEC

52
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:16,013
BALDWIN.

53
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:16,748
REMEMBER, ALEC BALDWIN LOST A

54
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:18,449
TALK SHOW AFTER THE FIRST OR

55
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:20,652
SECOND NIGHT AFTER HE MADE A

56
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:21,686
HOMOPHOBIC REMARK I THINK ON

57
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:22,887
THE STREET TO HIS REPORTER.

58
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:23,755
HIS SHOW WENT LIKE THAT.

59
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:25,190
OF COURSE HE GOT A SECOND

60
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,924
CHANCE AND MAYBE A THIRD

61
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:26,291
CHANCE.

62
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,892
WILL THEY AFFORD SECOND AND

63
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:29,494
THIRD CHANCES TO ROSEANNE?

64
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:30,195
I DON’T KNOW.

65
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:31,796
SHE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO SAY A

66
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:32,864
LOT OF CRAZY STUFF.

67
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:34,065
WE KNEW THAT.

68
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:35,767
I DID A MONOLOGUE PRAISING HER

69
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:37,736
SHOW BUT I KNEW SHE HAD ALWAYS

70
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:39,204
THE POTENTIAL TO SAY NUTTY

71
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:40,138
STUFF.

72
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:43,675
YOU LOOK AT GILBERT GODFRIED.

73
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,010
I DON’T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

74
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,912
HIS TWEETS AFTER THE JAPANESE

75
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:47,379
EARTHQUAKE.

76
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:49,414
>> Dana: YES.

77
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:50,715
>> COMEDIANS HAVE A THING

78
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:51,683
WHERE THEY SEE A CLIFF AND

79
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:53,351
THEY JUMP OFF OF IT.

80
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:55,187
THE OLD DAYS, YOU COULD GET

81
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:55,787
AWAY WITH IT.

82
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:56,455
NOT ANYMORE.

83
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,689
NOT WITH THE FACT THAT

84
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,691
EVERYTHING IS PERMANENT.

85
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:01,560
TWITTER IS THE BATHROOM WALL

86
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,594
FOR PLANET EARTH.

87
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:05,264
YOU CAN’T UNSCRUB IT.

88
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:07,733
SHE MADE A STUPID, FOOLISH

89
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:08,967
ERROR, MISTAKE.

90
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,235
NOW SHE IS PAYING FOR IT.

91
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:11,737
>> Dana: CAN I ASK ONE LAST

92
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:13,138
QUESTION BEFORE I LET YOU GO?

93
00:02:13,138 --> 00:02:13,539
>> YES.

94
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:14,273
>> Dana: WHAT DO YOU THINK

95
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:15,441
OF THE TEMPTATION, THERE WILL

96
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:18,077
BE TEMPTATION FOR PEOPLE TO

97
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:18,844
CONFLATE ROSEANNE BARR AND TRY

98
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:20,412
TO SAY SHE IS REPRESENTATIVE

99
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:21,513
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

100
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:23,048
>> I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHAT?

101
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:26,752
BOTH SIDES OFTEN DO THAT.

102
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:29,522
I HAVE DONE THAT.

103
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:31,357
WHEN ALEC BALDWIN SAYS

104
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:33,359
SOMETHING RIDICULOUS I’D GO,

105
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:34,693
OH, YOU LEFTISTS!

106
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,362
ALL YOU LEFTISTS ARE THE SAME!

107
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:37,463
I’D BRING UP AELECTION

108
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:37,797
BALDWIN.

109
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:39,699
WE ALL AS HUMANS IN OUR TRIBES

110
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:43,769
HAVE AN INSTINCT TO DO THAT.

111
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:44,904
I DON’T KNOW.

112
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:47,306
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE

113
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,674
BEYOND THIS KIND OF THING.

114
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,109
>> Dana: I SAID BUT I HAVE

115
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:50,743
ONE LAST QUESTION.

116
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:51,144
>> SURE.

117
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:52,411
>> Dana: DO YOU THINK IF

118
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,980
PEOPLE WERE TO GET OFF

119
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,981
TWITTER, RIGHT -- SHE SAID

120
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:56,749
BEFORE SHE GOT FIRED OKAY, I

121
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:57,116
APOLOGIZE.

122
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,051
IT WAS A JOKE.

123
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:58,851
I APOLOGIZE.

124
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:00,219
I’M NO LONGER GOING TO BE ON

125
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:00,753
TWITTER.

126
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:01,888
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE BELIEVE

127
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:03,323
THAT TWITTER IS WHAT GIVES

128
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:04,958
THEM SOME SORT OF POWER?

129
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,160
LIKE IT’S SOME SORT OF FUEL

130
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,028
FOR THEIR CAREERS?

131
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:11,765
>> YEAH, I THINK TWITTER

132
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,133
CREATES POTENTIAL FOR YOU TO

133
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,968
BE AN IDIOT.

134
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,703
I THINK WE HAVE BEEN TRICKED

135
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,104
INTO THINKING IT’S GOOD TO

136
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:19,139
PROMOTE STUFF AND YOU HAVE TO

137
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,407
BE OUT THERE AND YOU HAVE TO

138
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:21,574
HAVE TONS OF FOLLOWERS.

139
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:23,677
WHAT IT REALLY DOES IS IT JUST

140
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:25,111
CREATES ANOTHER OPENING FOR

141
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:26,413
YOU TO BE A JERK.

142
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:27,147
>> Dana: RIGHT.

143
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:28,682
POSSIBLY TO GET FIRED.

144
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:30,183
>> I COUNT MYSELF, BY THE WAY,

145
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:31,485
I COUNT MYSELF AMONG THE JERK

146
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:31,918
GROUP.

147
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:32,552
>> Dana: YOU REMEMBER THE

148
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:34,855
BOOK I WANT TO WRITE?

149
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:36,089
TWEETS I NEVER SENT.

150
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,257
>> I’M SURE THEY ARE AWFUL.

151
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:39,359
I HAVE HEARD YOU IN PRIVATE

152
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:39,760
MOMENTS.

153
00:03:39,760 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU ARE DESPICABLE.
