HALL WHERE THE PRESIDENT WILL 
APPEAR IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.
HE JUST ARRIVED AT TRUMP TOWER, 
EXPECTING TOUGH TALK TODAY ON 
IRAN AND NORTH KOREA.
I'M HERE WITH OUR CHIEF WHITE 
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN 
KARL.
AND JON, HERE COMES THE 
PRESIDENT.
LET'S WATCH HIM WALK IN.
AS WE DO THIS, ONE THING HE'S 
GOING TO BE SEEING IN THE FRONT 
ROW, THE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATE. 
>> Reporter: THEY WILL BE FRONT 
AND CENTER, REPRESENTATIVES OF 
THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.
THE INDICATION THAT I HAVE HEARD
IS THIS WILL BE A VERY TOUGH 
MESSAGE ON NORTH KOREA, URGING 
THE WORLD TO ISOLATE NORTH KOREA
AND REMINDING THEM THAT THERE IS
A MILITARY OPTION IF DIPLOMACY 
FAILS. 
>> THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO 
GALVANIZE THE WORLD, WILL SPEAK 
ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM AS 
WELL.
HE'S THREATENING TO PULL OUT OF 
THAT AGREEMENT.
LET'S LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT.
>>> MR. SECRETARY GENERAL, 
MR. PRESIDENT, WORLD LEADERS, 
AND DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES, 
WELCOME TO NEW YORK.
IT IS A PROFOUND HONOR TO STAND 
HERE IN MY HOME CITY AS A 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE OF 
THE WORLD.
AS MILLIONS OF OUR CITIZENS 
CONTINUE TO SUFFER THE EFFECTS 
OF THE DEVASTATING HURRICANES 
THAT HAVE STRUCK OUR COUNTRY, I 
WANT TO BEGIN BY EXPRESSING MY 
APPRECIATION TO EVERY LEADER IN 
THIS ROOM WHO HAS OFFERED 
ASSISTANCE AND AID.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STRONG 
AND RESILIENT, AND THEY WILL 
EMERGE FROM THESE HARDSHIPS MORE
DETERMINED THAN EVER BEFORE.
FORTUNATELY THE UNITED STATES 
HAS DONE VERY WELL SINCE 
ELECTION DAY LAST NOVEMBER 8th.
THE STOCK MARKET IS AT AN 
ALL-TIME HIGH, A RECORD.
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT ITS LOWEST 
LEVEL IN 16 YEARS, AND BECAUSE 
OF OUR REGULATORY AND OTHER 
REFORMS, WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE 
WORKING IN THE UNITED STATES 
TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE.
COMPANIES ARE MOVING BACK, 
CREATING JOB GROWTH THE LIKES OF
WHICH OUR COUNTRY HAS NOT SEEN 
IN A VERY LONG TIME, AND IT HAS 
JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT WE WILL
BE SPENDING ALMOST $700 BILLION 
ON OUR MILITARY AND DEFENSE.
OUR MILITARY WILL SOON BE THE 
STRONGEST IT HAS EVER BEEN.
FOR MORE THAN 70 YEARS IN TIMES 
OF WAR AND PEACE, THE LEADERS OF
NATIONS, MOVEMENTS AND RELIGIONS
HAVE STOOD BEFORE THIS ASSEMBLY.
LIKE THEM I INTEND TO ADDRESS 
SOME OF THE VERY SERIOUS THREATS
BEFORE US TODAY, BUT ALSO THE 
ENORMOUS POTENTIAL WAITING TO BE
UNLEASHED.
WE LIVE IN A TIME OF 
EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY.
BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE, 
TECHNOLOGY, AND MEDICINE ARE 
CURING ILLNESSES AND SOLVING 
PROBLEMS THAT PRIOR GENERATIONS 
THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE.
BUT EACH DAY ALSO BRINGS NEWS OF
GROWING DANGERS THAT THREATEN 
EVERYTHING WE CHERISH AND VALUE.
TERRORISTS AND EXTREMISTS HAVE 
GATHERED STRENGTH AND SPREAD TO 
EVERY REGION OF THE PLANET.
ROGUE REGIMES REPRESENTED IN 
THIS BODY NOT ONLY SUPPORT 
TERRORISTS BUT THREATEN OTHER 
NATIONS AND THEIR OWN PEOPLE 
WITH THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE 
WEAPONS KNOWN TO HUMANITY.
AUTHORITY AND AUTHORITARIAN 
POWERS SEEK TO COLLAPSE THE 
VALUES, THE SYSTEMS, AND 
ALLIANCES THAT PREVENTED 
CONFLICT AND TILTED THE WORLD 
TOWARD FREEDOM SINCE WORLD WAR 
II.
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL NETWORKS 
TRAFFIC DRUGS, WEAPONS, PEOPLE, 
FORCE DISLOCATION AND MASS 
MIGRATION, THREATEN OUR BORDERS,
AND NEW FORMS OF AGGRESSION 
EXPLOIT TECHNOLOGY TO MENACE OUR
CITIZENS.
TO PUT IT SIMPLY, WE MEET AT A 
TIME OF BOTH IMMENSE PROMISE AND
GREAT PERIL.
IT IS ENTIRELY UP TO US WHETHER 
WE LIFT THE WORLD TO NEW HEIGHTS
OR LET IT FALL INTO A VALLEY OF 
DISREPAIR.
WE HAVE IT IN OUR POWER, SHOULD 
WE SO CHOOSE, TO LIFT MILLIONS 
FROM POVERTY, TO HELP OUR 
CITIZENS REALIZE THEIR DREAMS, 
AND TO ENSURE THAT NEW 
GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN ARE 
RAISED FREE FROM VIOLENCE, 
HATRED, AND FEAR.
THIS INSTITUTION WAS FOUNDED IN 
THE AFTERMATH OF TWO WORLD WARS 
TO HELP SHAPE THIS BETTER 
FUTURE.
IT WAS BASED ON THE DIVISION 
THAT DIVERSE NATIONS COULD 
COOPERATE TO PROTECT THEIR 
SOVEREIGNTY, PRESERVE THEIR 
SECURITY, AND PROMOTE THEIR 
PROSPERITY.
IT WAS IN THE SAME PERIOD 
EXACTLY 70 YEARS AGO THAT THE 
UNITED STATES DEVELOPED THE 
MARSHALL PLAN TO HELP RESTORE 
EUROPE.
THOSE THREE BEAUTIFUL PILLARS, 
THEY'RE PILLARS OF PEACE, 
SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, AND 
PROSPERITY.
THE MARSHALL PLAN WAS BUILT ON 
THE NOBLE IDEA THAT THE WHOLE 
WORLD IS SAFER WHEN NATIONS ARE 
STRONG, INDEPENDENT, AND FREE.
AS PRESIDENT TRUMAN SAID IN HIS 
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS AT THAT 
TIME, OUR SUPPORT OF EUROPEAN 
RECOVERY IS IN FULL ACCORD WITH 
OUR SUPPORT OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS.
THE SUCCESS OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS DEPENDS UPON THE 
INDEPENDENT STRENGTH OF ITS 
MEMBERS.
TO OVERCOME THE PERILS OF THE 
PRESENT AND TO ACHIEVE THE 
PROMISE OF THE FUTURE, WE MUST 
BEGIN WITH THE WISDOM OF THE 
PAST.
OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON A 
COALITION OF STRONG AND 
INDEPENDENT NATIONS THAT EMBRACE
THEIR SOVEREIGNTY TO PROMOTE 
SECURITY, PROSPERITY AND PEACE 
FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE 
WORLD.
WE DO NOT EXPECT DIVERSE 
COUNTRIES TO SHARE THE SAME 
CULTURES, TRADITIONS, OR EVEN 
SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT, BUT WE DO
EXPECT ALL NATIONS TO UPHOLD 
THESE TWO CORE SOVEREIGN DUTIES,
TO RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF 
THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND THE RIGHTS 
OF EVERY OTHER SOVEREIGN NATION.
THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL VISION OF 
THIS INSTITUTION, AND THIS IS 
THE FOUNDATION FOR COOPERATION 
AND SUCCESS.
STRONG SOVEREIGN NATIONS LET 
DIVERSE COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT
VALUES, DIFFERENT CULTURES AND 
DIFFERENT DREAMS NOT JUST 
COEXIST BUT WORK SIDE BY SIDE ON
THE BASIS OF MUTUAL RESPECT.
STRONG SOVEREIGN NATIONS LET 
THEIR PEOPLE TAKE OWNERSHIP OF 
THE FUTURE AND CONTROL THEIR OWN
DESTINY.
AND STRONG SOVEREIGN NATIONS 
ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO FLOURISH IN
THE FULLNESS OF THE LIFE 
INTENDED BY GOD.
IN AMERICA, WE DO NOT SEEK TO 
IMPOSE OUR WAY OF LIFE ON 
ANYONE, BUT RATHER, TO LET IT 
SHINE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR EVERYONE
TO WATCH.
THIS WEEK GIVES OUR COUNTRY A 
SPECIAL REASON TO TAKE PRIDE IN 
THAT EXAMPLE.
WE ARE CELEBRATING THE 230th 
ANNIVERSARY OF OUR BELOVED 
CONSTITUTION, THE OLDEST 
CONSTITUTION STILL IN USE IN THE
WORLD TODAY.
THIS TIMELESS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN 
THE FOUNDATION OF PEACE, 
PROSPERITY AND FREEDOM FOR THE 
AMERICANS AND FOR COUNTLESS 
MILLIONS AROUND THE GLOBE WHOSE 
OWN COUNTRIES HAVE FOUND 
INSPIRATION IN ITS RESPECT FOR 
HUMAN NATURE, HUMAN DIGNITY, AND
THE RULE OF LAW.
THE GREATEST IN THE UNITED 
STATES CONSTITUTION IS ITS FIRST
THREE BEAUTIFUL WORDS.
THEY ARE, "WE THE PEOPLE."
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE 
SACRIFICED TO MAINTAIN THE 
PROMISE OF THOSE WORDS, THE 
PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY AND OF 
OUR GREAT HISTORY.
IN AMERICA, THE PEOPLE GOVERN.
THE PEOPLE RULE.
AND THE PEOPLE ARE SOVEREIGN.
I WAS ELECTED NOT TO TAKE POWER 
BUT TO GIVE POWER TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHERE IT 
BELONGS.
IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS WE ARE 
RENEWING THIS FOUNDING PRINCIPLE
OF SOVEREIGNTY.
OUR GOVERNMENT'S FIRST DUTY IS 
TO ITS PEOPLE, TO OUR CITIZENS, 
TO SERVE THEIR NEEDS, TO ENSURE 
THEIR SAFETY, TO PRESERVE THEIR 
RIGHTS AND TO DEFEND THEIR 
VALUES.
AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, I WILL ALWAYS PUT 
AMERICA FIRST, JUST LIKE YOU AS 
THE LEADERS OF YOUR COUNTRIES 
WILL ALWAYS AND SHOULD ALWAYS 
PUT YOUR COUNTRIES FIRST.
ALL RESPONSIBLE LEADERS HAVE AN 
OBLIGATION TO SERVE THEIR OWN 
CITIZENS AND THE NATION STATE 
REMAINS THE BEST VEHICLE FOR 
ELEVATING THE HUMAN CONDITION.
BUT MAKING A BETTER LIFE FOR OUR
PEOPLE ALSO REQUIRES US TO WORK 
TOGETHER IN CLOSE HARMONY AND 
UNITY TO CREATE A MORE SAFE AND 
PEACEFUL FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE.
THE UNITED STATES WILL FOREVER 
BE A GREAT FRIEND TO THE WORLD, 
AND ESPECIALLY TO ITS ALLIES.
WE CAN NO LONGER BE TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE OF OR ENTER INTO A 
ONE-SIDED DEAL WHERE THE UNITED 
STATES GETS NOTHING IN RETURN.
AS LONG AS I HOLD THIS OFFICE, I
WILL DEFEND AMERICA'S INTERESTS 
ABOVE ALL ELSE, BUT IN 
FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS TO 
OUR OWN NATIONS, WE ALSO REALIZE
THAT IT'S IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST
TO SEEK A FUTURE WHERE ALL 
NATIONS CAN BE SOVEREIGN, 
PROSPEROUS AND SECURE.
AMERICA DOES MORE THAN SPEAK FOR
THE VALUES EXPRESSED IN THE 
UNITED NATIONS CHARTER.
OUR CITIZENS HAVE PAID THE 
ULTIMATE PRICE TO DEFEND OUR 
FREEDOM AND THE FREEDOM OF MANY 
NATIONS REPRESENTED IN THIS 
GREAT HALL.
AMERICA'S DEVOTION IS MEASURED 
ON THE BATTLEFIELDS WHERE OUR 
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN HAVE FOUGHT 
AND SACRIFICED ALONGSIDE OF OUR 
ALLIES.
FROM THE BEACHES OF EUROPE TO 
THE DESERTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
TO THE JUNGLES OF ASIA, IT IS AN
ETERNAL CREDIT TO THE AMERICAN 
CHARACTER THAT EVEN AFTER WE AND
OUR ALLIES EMERGE VICTORIOUS 
FROM THE BLOODIEST WAR IN 
HISTORY, WE DID NOT SEEK 
TERRITORIAL EXPANSION OR ATTEMPT
TO OPPOSE AND IMPOSE OUR WAY OF 
LIFE ON OTHERS.
INSTEAD, WE HELPED BUILD 
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THIS ONE TO
DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY, 
SECURITY, AND PROSPERITY FOR 
ALL.
FOR THE DIVERSE NATIONS OF THE 
WORLD, THIS IS OUR HOPE.
WE WANT HARMONY AND FRIENDSHIP, 
NOT CONFLICT AND STRIFE.
WE ARE GUIDED BY OUTCOMES, NOT 
IDEOLOGY.
WE HAVE A POLICY OF PRINCIPLED 
REALISM ROOTED IN SHARED GOALS, 
INTERESTS, AND VALUES.
THAT REALISM FORCES US TO 
CONFRONT A QUESTION FACING EVERY
LEADER AND NATION IN THIS ROOM.
IT IS A QUESTION WE CANNOT 
ESCAPE OR AVOID.
WE WILL SLIDE DOWN THE PATH OF 
COMPLACENCY NUMB TO THE 
CHALLENGES, THREATS AND EVEN 
WARS THAT WE FACE.
OR, DO WE HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH 
AND PRIDE TO CONFRONT THOSE 
DANGERS TODAY SO THAT OUR 
CITIZENS CAN ENJOY PEACE AND 
PROSPERITY TOMORROW.
IF WE DESIRE TO LIFT UP OUR 
CITIZENS, IF WE ASPIRE TO THE 
APPROVAL OF HISTORY, THEN WE 
MUST FULFILL OUR SOVEREIGN 
DUTIES TO THE PEOPLE WE 
FAITHFULLY REPRESENT.
WE MUST PROTECT OUR NATIONS, 
THEIR INTERESTS AND THEIR 
FUTURES.
WE MUST REJECT THREATS TO 
SOVEREIGNTY FROM THE UKRAINE TO 
THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.
WE MUST UPHOLD RESPECT FOR LAW, 
RESPECT FOR BORDERS, AND RESPECT
FOR CULTURE, AND THE PEACEFUL 
ENGAGEMENT THESE ALLOW.
AND JUST AS THE FOUNDERS OF THIS
BODY INTENDED, WE MUST WORK 
TOGETHER AND CONFRONT TOGETHER 
THOSE WHO THREATEN US WITH 
CHAOS, TURMOIL AND TERROR.
THE SURCOURGE OF OUR PLANET TOD 
VIOLATES THE VERY PRINCIPLE IN 
WHICH THE UNITED NATIONS IS 
BASED.
THEY RESPECT NEITHER THEIR OWN 
CITIZENS NOR THE SOVEREIGN 
RIGHTS OF THEIR COUNTRIES.
IF THE RIGHTEOUS MANY DO NOT 
CONFRONT THE WICKED FEW, THEN 
EVIL WILL TRIUMPH.
WHEN DECENT PEOPLE AND NATIONS 
BECOME BYSTANDERS TO HISTORY, 
THE FORCES OF DESTRUCTION ONLY 
GATHER POWER AND STRENGTH.
NO ONE HAS SHOWN MORE CONTEMPT 
FOR OTHER NATIONS AND FOR THE 
WELL-BEING OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE 
THAN THE DEPRAVED REGIME IN 
NORTH KOREA.
IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
STARVATION DEATHS OF MILLIONS OF
NORTH KOREANS, AND FOR THE 
IMPRISONMENT, TORTURE, KILLING 
AND OPPRESSION OF COUNTLESS 
MORE.
WE WERE ALL WITNESS TO THE 
REGIME'S DEADLY ABUSE WHEN AN 
INNOCENT AMERICAN COLLEGE 
STUDENT, OTTO WARMBIER, WAS 
RETURNED TO AMERICA ONLY TO DIE 
A FEW DAYS LATER.
WE SAW IT IN THE ASSASSINATION 
OF THE DICTATOR'S BROTHER, USING
BANNED NERVE AGENTS IN AN 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
WE KNOW IT KIDNAPPED A SWEET 
13-YEAR-OLD JAPANESE GIRL FROM A
BEACH IN HER OWN COUNTRY TO 
ENSLAVE HER AS A LANGUAGE TUTOR 
FOR NORTH KOREA'S SPIES.
IF THIS IS NOT TWISTED ENOUGH, 
NOW NORTH KOREA'S RECKLESS 
PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 
BALLISTIC MISSILES THREATENS THE
ENTIRE WORLD WITH UNTHINKABLE 
LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE.
IT IS AN OUTRAGE THAT SOME 
NATIONS WOULD NOT ONLY TRADE 
WITH SUCH A REGIME BUT WOULD 
ARM, SUPPLY AND FINANCIALLY 
SUPPORT A COUNTRY THAT IMPERILS 
THE WORLD WITH NUCLEAR CONFLICT.
NO NATION ON EARTH HAS AN 
INTEREST IN SEEING THIS BAND OF 
CRIMINALS ARM ITSELF WITH 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MISSILES.
THE UNITED STATES HAS GREAT 
STRENGTH AND PATIENCE, BUT IF IT
IS FORCED TO DEFEND ITSELF OR 
ITS ALLIES, WE WILL HAVE NO 
CHOICE BUT TO TOTALLY DESTROY 
NORTH KOREA.
ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE 
MISSION FOR HIMSELF AND FOR HIS 
REGIME.
THE UNITED STATES IS READY, 
WILLING AND ABLE, BUT HOPEFULLY 
THIS WILL NOT BE NECESSARY.
THAT'S WHAT THE UNITED NATIONS 
IS ALL ABOUT.
THAT'S WHAT THE UNITED NATIONS 
IS FOR.
LET'S SEE HOW THEY DO.
IT IS TIME FOR NORTH KOREA TO 
REALIZE THAT THE 
DENUCLEARIZATION IS ITS ONLY 
ACCEPTABLE FUTURE.
THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY 
COUNCIL RECENTLY HELD TWO 
UNANIMOUS 15-0 VOTES ADOPTING 
HARD-HITTING RESOLUTIONS AGAINST
NORTH KOREA, AND I WANT TO THANK
CHINA AND RUSSIA FOR JOINING THE
VOTE TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS, ALONG 
WITH ALL OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.
THANK YOU TO ALL INVOLVED.
BUT WE MUST DO MUCH MORE.
IT IS TIME FOR ALL NATIONS TO 
WORK TOGETHER TO ISOLATE THE KIM
REGIME UNTIL IT CEASES ITS 
HOSTILE BEHAVIOR.
WE FACE THIS DECISION NOT ONLY 
IN NORTH KOREA.
IT IS FAR PAST TIME FOR THE 
NATIONS OF THE WORLD TO CONFRONT
ANOTHER RECKLESS REGIME, ONE 
THAT SPEAKS OPENLY OF MASS 
MURDER, VOWING DEATH TO AMERICA,
DESTRUCTION TO ISRAEL AND RUIN 
FOR MANY LEADERS AND NATIONS IN 
THIS ROOM.
THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT MASKS A 
CORRUPT DICTATORSHIP BEHIND THE 
FALSE GUISE OF A DEMOCRACY.
IT HAS TURNED A WEALTHY COUNTRY 
WITH A RICH HISTORY AND CULTURE 
INTO AN ECONOMICALLY DEPLETED 
ROGUE STATE WHOSE CHEAP EXPORTS 
ARE VIOLENT, BLOODSHED AND 
CHAOS.
THE LONGEST SUFFERING VICTIMS OF
IRAN'S LEADERS ARE, IN FACT, ITS
OWN PEOPLE.
RATHER THAN USE ITS RESOURCES TO
IMPROVE IRANIAN LIVES, ITS OIL 
PROFITS GO TO FUND HEZBOLLAH AND
OTHER TERRORISTS THAT KILL 
INNOCENT MUSLIMS AND ATTACK 
THEIR PEACEFUL ARAB AND ISRAELI 
NEIGHBORS.
THIS WEALTH WHICH RIGHTLY 
BELONGS TO IRAN'S PEOPLE ALSO 
GOES TO SHORE UP BASHAR AL 
ASSAD'S DICTATORSHIP, FUEL 
YEMEN'S CIVIL WAR AND UNDERMINE 
PEACE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 
MIDDLE EAST.
WE CANNOT LET A MURDEROUS REGIME
CONTINUE THESE DESTABILIZING 
ACTIVITIES WHILE BUILDING 
DANGEROUS MISSILES, AND WE 
CANNOT ABIDE BY AN AGREEMENT IF 
IT PROVIDES COVER FOR THE 
EVENTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF A 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
THE IRAN DEAL WAS ONE OF THE 
WORST AND MOST ONE-SIDED 
TRANSACTIONS THE UNITED STATES 
HAS EVER ENTERED INTO.
FRANKLY, THAT DEAL IS AN 
EMBARRASSMENT TO THE UNITED 
STATES, AND I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
HEARD THE LAST OF IT, BELIEVE 
ME.
IT IS TIME FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD 
TO JOIN US IN DEMANDING THAT 
IRAN'S GOVERNMENT END ITS 
PURSUIT OF DEATH AND 
DESTRUCTION.
IT IS TIME FOR THE REGIME TO 
FREE ALL AMERICANS AND CITIZENS 
OF OTHER NATIONS THAT THEY HAVE 
UNJUSTLY DETAINED.
AND ABOVE ALL, IRAN'S GOVERNMENT
MUST STOP SUPPORTING TERRORISTS,
BEGIN SERVING ITS OWN PEOPLE, 
AND RESPECT THE SOVEREIGN RIGHTS
OF ITS NEIGHBORS.
THE ENTIRE WORLD UNDERSTANDS 
THAT THE GOOD PEOPLE OF IRAN 
WANT CHANGE, AND OTHER THAN THE 
VAST MILITARY POWER OF THE 
UNITED STATES, THAT IRAN'S 
PEOPLE ARE WHAT THEIR LEADERS 
FEAR THE MOST.
THIS IS WHAT CAUSES THE REGIME 
TO RESTRICT INTERNET ACCESS, 
TEAR DOWN SATELLITE DISHES, 
SHOOT UNARMED STUDENT 
PROTESTORS, AND IMPRISONEN 
POLITICAL REFORMERS.
OPPRESSIVE REGIMES CANNOT ENDURE
FOREVER, AND THE DAY WILL COME 
WHEN THE PEOPLE WILL FACE A 
CHOICE.
WILL THEY CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH
OF POSIVPOVERTY, BLOOD SHED AND 
TERROR, OR WILL THE IRANIAN 
PEOPLE RETURN TO THE NATION'S 
PROUD ROOTS AS A CENTER OF 
CIVILIZATION, CULTURE AND WEALTH
WHERE THEIR PEOPLE CAN BE HAPPY 
AND PROSPEROUS ONCE AGAIN.
THE IRANIAN REGIME SUPPORT FOR 
TERROR IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO 
THE RECENT COMMITMENTS OF MANY 
OF ITS NEIGHBORS TO FIGHT 
TERRORISM AND HALT ITS 
FINANCING.
IN SAUDI ARABIA EARLY LAST YEAR,
I WAS GREATLY HONORED TO ADDRESS
THE LEADERS OF MORE THAN 50 ARAB
AND MUSLIM NATIONS.
WE AGREED THAT ALL RESPONSIBLE 
NATIONS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO 
CONFRONT TERRORISTS AND THE 
ISLAMIC EXTREMISM THAT INSPIRES 
THEM.
WE WILL STOP RADICAL ISLAMIC 
TERRORISM BECAUSE WE CANNOT 
ALLOW IT TO TEAR UP OUR NATION 
AND INDEED TO TEAR UP THE ENTIRE
WORLD.
WE MUST DENY THE TERRORISTS SAFE
HAVEN, TRANSIT, FUNDING, AND ANY
FORM OF SUPPORT FOR THEIR VILE 
AND SINISTER IDEOLOGY.
WE MUST DRIVE THEM OUT OF OUR 
NATIONS.
IT IS TIME TO EXPOSE AND HOLD 
RESPONSIBLE THOSE COUNTRIES WHO 
SUPPORT AND FINANCE TERROR 
GROUPS LIKE AL QAEDA, HEZBOLLAH,
THE TALIBAN, AND OTHERS THAT 
SLAUGHTER INNOCENT PEOPLE.
THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES
ARE WORKING TOGETHER THROUGHOUT 
THE MIDDLE EAST TO CRUSH THE 
LOSER TERRORISTS AND STOP THE 
REEMERGENCE OF SAFE HAVENS THEY 
USE TO LAUNCH ATTACKS ON ALL OF 
OUR PEOPLE.
LAST MONTH I ANNOUNCED A NEW 
STRATEGY FOR VICTORY IN THE 
FIGHT AGAINST THIS EVIL IN 
AFGHANISTAN.
FROM NOW ON, OUR SECURITY 
INTERESTS WILL DICTATE THE 
LENGTH AND SCOPE OF MILITARY 
OPERATIONS, NOT ARBITRARY 
BENCHMARKS AND TIMETABLES SET UP
BY POLITICIANS.
I HAVE ALSO TOTALLY CHANGED THE 
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT IN OUR FIGHT
AGAINST THE TALIBAN AND OTHER 
TERRORIST GROUPS.
IN SYRIA AND IRAQ, WE HAVE MADE 
BIG GAINS TOWARD LASTING DEFEAT 
OF ISIS.
IN FACT, OUR COUNTRY HAS 
ACHIEVED MORE AGAINST ISIS IN 
THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS THAN IT 
HAS IN MANY, MANY YEARS 
COMBINED.
WE SEEK THE DEESCALATION OF THE 
SYRIAN CONFLICT AND A POLITICAL 
SOLUTION THAT HONORS THE WILL OF
THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.
THE ACTIONS OF THE CRIMINAL 
REGIME OF BASHAR AL ASSAD, 
INCLUDING THE USE OF CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN 
CITIZENS, EVEN INNOCENT 
CHILDREN, SHOCK THE CONSCIENCE 
OF EVERY DECENT PERSON.
NO SOCIETY COULD BE SAFE IF 
BANNED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE 
ALLOWED TO SPREAD.
THAT IS WHY THE UNITED STATES 
CARRIED OUT A MISSILE STRIKE ON 
THE AIR BASE THAT LAUNCHED THE 
ATTACK.
WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE
UNITED NATIONS' AGENCIES THAT 
ARE PROVIDING VITAL HUMANITARIAN
ASSISTANCE IN AREAS LIBERATED 
FROM ISIS, AND WE ESPECIALLY 
THANK JORDAN, TURKEY, AND 
LEBANON FOR THEIR ROLE IN 
HOSTING REFUGEES FROM THE SYRIAN
CONFLICT.
THE UNITED STATES IS A 
COMPASSIONATE NATION AND HAS 
SPENT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS IN HELPING TO SUPPORT 
THIS EFFORT.
WE SEEK AN APPROACH TO REFUGEE 
RESETTLEMENT THAT IS DESIGNED TO
HELP THESE HORRIBLY TREATED 
PEOPLE AND WHICH ENABLES THEIR 
EVENTUAL RETURN TO THEIR HOME 
COUNTRIES TO BE PART OF THE 
REBUILDING PROCESS.
FOR THE COST OF RESETTLING ONE 
REFUGEE IN THE UNITED STATES, WE
CAN ASSIST MORE THAN 10 IN THEIR
HOME REGION.
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF OUR 
HEARTS, WE OFFER FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE TO HOSTING COUNTRIES 
IN THE REGION, AND WE SUPPORT 
RECENT AGREEMENTS OF THE G20 
NATIONS THAT WILL SEEK TO HOST 
REFUGEES AS CLOSE TO THEIR HOME 
COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE.
THIS IS THE SAFE, RESPONSIBLE, 
AND HUMANITARIAN APPROACH.
FOOR
FOR DECADES THE UNITED STATES 
HAS DEALT WITH MIGRATION 
CHALLENGES HERE IN THE WESTERN 
HEMISPHERE.
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT OVER THE 
LONG TERM, UNCONTROLLED 
MIGRATION IS DEEPLY UNFAIR TO 
BOTH THE SENDING AND THE 
RECEIVING COUNTRIES.
FOR THE SENDING COUNTRIES, IT 
REDUCES DOMESTIC PRESSURE TO 
PURSUE NEEDED POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMIC REFORM AND DRAINS THEM 
OF THE HUMAN CAPITAL NECESSARY 
TO MOTIVATE AND IMPLEMENT THOSE 
REFORMS.
FOR THE RECEIVING COUNTRIES, THE
SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OF 
UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION ARE BOURN
OVERWHELMINGLY BY LOW INCOME 
CITIZENS WHOSE CONCERNS ARE 
OFTEN IGNORED BY BOTH MEDIA AND 
GOVERNMENT.
I WANT TO SALUTE THE WORK OF THE
UNITED NATIONS IN SEEKING TO 
ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT CAUSE 
PEOPLE TO FLEE FROM THEIR HOMES.
THE UNITED NATIONS AND AFRICAN 
UNION LED PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS 
TO HAVE INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
IN STABILIZING CONFLICTS IN 
AFRICA.
THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO 
LEAD THE WORLD IN HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING FAMINE 
PREVENTION AND RELIEF IN SOUTH 
SUDAN, SOMALIA, AND NORTHERN 
NIGERIA AND YEMEN.
WE HAVE INVESTED IN BETTER 
HEALTH AND OPPORTUNITY ALL OVER 
THE WORLD THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE 
PEP FAR WHICH FUNDS AIDS RELIEF,
THE PRESIDENT'S MALARIA 
INITIATIVE, THE GLOBAL HEALTH 
SECURITY AGENDA, THE GLOBAL FUND
TO END MODERN SLAVERY, AND THE 
WOMAN ENTREPRENEURS FINANCE 
INITIATIVE.
PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO 
EMPOWERING WOMEN ALL ACROSS THE 
GLOBE.
WE ALSO THANK -- 
THANK YOU.
WE ALSO THANK THE SECRETARY 
GENERAL FOR RECOGNIZING THAT THE
UNITED NATIONS MUST REFORM IF IT
IS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE PARTNER IN
CONFRONTING THREATS TO 
SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, AND 
PROSPERITY.
TOO OFTEN THE FOCUS OF THIS 
ORGANIZATION HAS NOT BEEN ON 
RESULTS BUT ON BUREAUCRACY AND 
PROCESS.
IN SOME CASES, STATES THAT SEEK 
TO SUBVERT THIS INSTITUTION'S 
NOBLE HAVE HIJACKED THE VERY 
SYSTEMS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO 
ADVANCE THEM.
FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS A MASSIVE 
SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT TO THE 
UNITED NATIONS THAT SOME 
GOVERNMENTS WITH EGREGIOUS HUMAN
RIGHTS RECORDS SIT ON THE U.N. 
HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL.
THE UNITED STATES IS 1 OUT OF 
193 COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS, AND YET WE PAY 22% OF 
THE ENTIRE BUDGET AND MORE.
IN FACT, WE PAY FAR MORE THAN 
ANYBODY REALIZES.
THE UNITED STATES BEARS AN 
UNFAIR COST BURDEN, BUT TO BE 
FAIR, IF IT COULD ACTUALLY 
ACCOMPLISH ALL OF ITS STATED 
GOALS, ESPECIALLY THE GOAL OF 
PEACE, THIS INVESTMENT WOULD 
EASILY BE WELL WORTH IT.
MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE WORLD ARE 
IN CONFLICT AND SOME, IN FACT, 
ARE GOING TO HELL, BUT THE 
POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM 
UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND AUSPICES 
OF THE UNITED NATIONS CAN SOLVE 
MANY OF THESE VICIOUS AND 
COMPLEX PROBLEMS.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOPE THAT 
ONE DAY SOON THE UNITED NATIONS 
CAN BE A MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABLE 
AND EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE FOR HUMAN
DIGNITY AND FREEDOM AROUND THE 
WORLD.
IN THE MEANTIME, WE BELIEVE THAT
NO NATION SHOULD HAVE TO BEAR A 
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE 
BURDEN MILITARILY OR 
FINANCIALLY.
NATIONS OF THE WORLD MUST TAKE A
GREATER ROLE IN PROMOTING SECURE
AND PROSPEROUS SOCIETIES IN 
THEIR OWN REGIONS.
THAT IS WHY IN THE WESTERN 
HEMISPHERE THE UNITED STATES HAS
STOOD AGAINST THE CORRUPT 
DESTABILIZING REGIME IN CUBA AND
EMBRACED THE ENDURING DREAM OF 
THE CUBAN PEOPLE TO LIVE IN 
FREEDOM.
MY ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY 
ANNOUNCED THAT WE WILL NOT LIFT 
SANCTIONS ON THE CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT MAKES 
FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS.
WE HAVE ALSO IMPOSED TOUGH 
CALIBRATED SANCTIONS ON THE 
SOCIALIST MADURO REGIME IN 
VENEZUELA WHICH HAS BROUGHT A 
ONCE THRIVING NATION TO THE 
BRINK OF TOTAL COLLAPSE.
THE SOCIALIST DICTATORSHIP OF 
NICOLAS MADURO HAS INFLICTED 
MATERIAL PAIN AND SUFFERING ON 
THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THAT COUNTRY.
THIS CORRUPT REGIME DESTROYED A 
PROSPEROUS NATION BY IMPOSING A 
FAILED IDEOLOGY THAT HAS 
PRODUCED POVERTY AND MISERY 
EVERYWHERE IT HAS BEEN TRIED.
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, MADURO 
HAS DEFIED HIS OWN PEOPLE, 
STEALING POWER FROM THEIR 
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES TO 
PRESERVE HIS DISASTROUS RULE.
THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE ARE 
STARVING AND THEIR COUNTRY IS 
COLLAPSING.
THEIR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 
ARE BEING DESTROYED.
THIS SITUATION IS COMPLETELY 
UNACCEPTABLE, AND WE CANNOT 
STAND BY AND WATCH.
AS A RESPONSIBLE NEIGHBOR AND 
FRIEND, WE AND ALL OTHERS HAVE A
GOAL.
THAT GOAL IS TO HELP THEM REGAIN
THEIR FREEDOM, RECOVER THEIR 
COUNTRY, AND RESTORE THEIR 
DEMOCRACY.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK LEADERS IN
THIS ROOM FOR CONDEMNING THE 
REGIME AND PROVIDING VITAL 
SUPPORT TO THE VENEZUELAN 
PEOPLE.
THE UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN 
IMPORTANT STEPS TO HOLD THE 
REGIME ACCOUNTABLE.
WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE FURTHER 
ACTION IF THE GOVERNMENT OF 
VENEZUELA PERSISTS ON ITS PATH 
TO IMPOSE AUTHORITARIAN RULE ON 
THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE.
WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE 
INCREDIBLY STRONG AND HEALTHY 
TRADE RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY OF
THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES 
GATHERED HERE TODAY.
OUR ECONOMIC BOND FORMS A 
CRITICAL FOUNDATION FOR 
ADVANCING PEACE AND PROSPERITY 
FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE AND ALL OF
OUR NEIGHBORS.
I ASK EVERY COUNTRY REPRESENTED 
HERE TODAY TO BE PREPARED TO DO 
MORE TO ADDRESS THIS VERY REAL 
CRISES.
WE CALL FOR THE FULL RESTORATION
OF DEMOCRACY AND POLITICAL 
FREEDOMS IN VENEZUELA.
THE PROBLEM IN VENEZUELA IS NOT 
THAT SOCIALISM HAS BEEN POORLY 
IMPLEMENTED, BUT THAT SOCIALISM 
HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED.
FROM THE SOVIET UNION TO CUBA TO
VENEZUELA, WHEREVER TRUE 
SOCIALISM OR COMMUNISM HAS BEEN 
ADOPTED, IT HAS DELIVERED 
ANGUISH AND DEVASTATION AND 
FAILURE.
THOSE WHO PREACH THE TENANTS OF 
THESE DISCREDITED IDEOLOGIES 
ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONTINUED
SUFFERING OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE
UNDER THESE CRUEL SYSTEMS.
AMERICA STANDS WITH EVERY PERSON
LIVING UNDER A BRUTAL REGIME.
OUR RESPECT FOR SOVEREIGNTY IS 
ALSO A CALL FOR ACTION.
ALL PEOPLE DESERVE A GOVERNMENT 
THAT CARES FOR THEIR SAFETY, 
THEIR INTERESTS AND THEIR 
WELL-BEING, INCLUDING THEIR 
PROSPERITY.
IN AMERICA WE SEEK STRONGER TIES
OF BUSINESS AND TRADE WITH ALL 
NATIONS OF GOOD WILL, BUT THIS 
TRADE MUST BE FAIR AND IT MUST 
BE RECIPROCAL.
FOR TOO LONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WERE TOLD THAT MAMMOTH 
MULTI-NATIONAL TRADE DEALS AND 
POWERFUL GLOBAL BUREAUCRACIES 
WERE THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE 
THEIR SUCCESS.
BUT AS THOSE PROMISES FLOWED, 
MILLIONS OF JOBS VANISHED AND 
THOUSANDS OF FACTORIES 
DISAPPEARED.
OTHERS GAMED THE SYSTEM AND 
BROKE THE RULES.
OUR GREAT MIDDLE CLASS, ONCE THE
BEDROCK OF AMERICAN PROSPERITY, 
WAS FORGOTTEN AND LEFT BEHIND.
BUT THEY ARE FORGOTTEN NO MORE, 
AND THEY WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
AGAIN.
WHILE AMERICA WILL PURSUE 
COOPERATION AND COMMERCE WITH 
OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE RENEWING 
OUR COMMITMENT TO THE FIRST DUTY
OF EVERY GOVERNMENT, THE DUTY OF
OUR CITIZENS.
THIS BOND IS THE SOURCE OF 
AMERICA'S STRENGTH AND THAT OF 
EVERY RESPONSIBLE NATION 
REPRESENTED HERE TODAY.
IF THIS ORGANIZATION IS TO HAVE 
ANY HOPE OF SUCCESSFULLY 
CONFRONTING THE CHALLENGES 
BEFORE US, IT WILL DEPEND, AS 
PRESIDENT TRUMAN SAID SOME 70 
YEARS AGO, ON THE INDEPENDENT 
STRENGTH OF ITS MEMBERS.
IF WE ARE TO EMBRACE THE 
OPPORTUNITIES OF THE FUTURE AND 
OVERCOME THE PRESENT DANGERS 
TOGETHER, THERE CAN BE NO 
SUBSTITUTE FOR STRONG, 
SOVEREIGN, AND INDEPENDENT 
NATIONS, NATIONS THAT ARE ROOTED
IN THEIR HISTORIES AND INVESTED 
IN THEIR DESTINIES, NATIONS THAT
SEEK ALLIES TO BEFRIEND, NOT 
ENEMIES TO CONQUER, AND MOST 
IMPORTANT OF ALL, NATIONS THAT 
ARE HOME TO PATRIOTS, TO MEN AND
WOMEN WHO ARE WILLING TO 
SACRIFICE FOR THEIR COUNTRIES, 
THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS, AND FOR 
ALL THAT IS BEST IN THE HUMAN 
SPIRIT.
IN REMEMBERING THE GREAT VICTORY
THAT LED TO THIS BODY'S 
FOUNDING, WE MUST NEVER FORGET 
THAT THOSE HEROS WHO FOUGHT 
AGAINST EVIL ALSO FOUGHT FOR THE
NATIONS THAT THEY LOVED.
PATRIOTISM LED THE POLES TO DIE 
TO SAVE POLAND, THE FRENCH TO 
FIGHT FOR A FREE FRANCE, AND THE
BRITS TO STAND STRONG FOR 
BRITAIN.
TODAY, IF WE DO NOT INVEST 
OURSELVES, OUR HEARTS AND OUR 
MINDS IN OUR NATIONS, IF WE WILL
NOT BUILD STRONG FAMILIES, SAFE 
COMMUNITIES, AND HEALTHY 
SOCIETIES FOR OURSELVES, NO ONE 
CAN DO IT FOR US.
WE CANNOT WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE,
FOR FARAWAY COUNTRIES OR FAR OFF
BUREAUCRACIES.
WE CAN'T DO IT.
WE MUST SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS TO 
BUILD OUR PROSPERITY, TO SECURE 
OUR FUTURE, OR WE WILL BUILD 
VULNERABLE TO DECAY, DOMINATION 
AND DEFEAT.
THE TRUE QUESTION FOR THE UNITED
NATIONS TODAY, FOR PEOPLE ALL 
OVER THE WORLD WHO HOPED FOR 
BETTER LIVES FOR THEMSELVES AND 
THEIR CHILDREN, IS A BASIC ONE.
ARE WE STILL PATRIOTS.
DO WE LOVE OUR NATIONS ENOUGH TO
PROTECT THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND TO
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR FUTURES.
DO WE REVERE THEM ENOUGH TO 
DEFEND THEIR INTERESTS, PRESERVE
THEIR CULTURES, AND ENSURE A 
PEACEFUL WORLD FOR THEIR 
CITIZENS.
ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN 
PATRIOTS, JOHN ADAMS, WROTE THAT
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AFFECTED
BEFORE THE WAR COMMENCED.
THE REVOLUTION WAS IN THE MINDS 
AND HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE.
THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN AMERICA
AWOKE, WHEN WE LOOKED AROUND AND
UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WERE A 
NATION.
WE REALIZED WHO WE WERE, WHAT WE
VALUED, AND WHAT WE WOULD GIVE 
OUR LIVES TO DEFEND.
FROM ITS VERY FIRST MOMENTS, THE
AMERICAN STORY IS THE STORY OF 
WHAT IS POSSIBLE WHEN PEOPLE 
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR FUTURE.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS
BEEN AMONG THE GREATEST FORCES 
FOR GOOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD AND THE GREATEST DEFENDERS
OF SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, AND 
PROSPERITY FOR ALL.
NOW WE ARE CALLING FOR A GREAT 
REAWAKENING OF NATIONS, FOR THE 
REVIVAL OF THEIR SPIRITS, THEIR 
PRIDE, THEIR PEOPLE, AND THEIR 
PATRIOTISM.
HISTORY IS ASKING US WHETHER WE 
ARE UP TO THE TASK.
OUR ANSWER WILL BE A RENEWAL OF 
WILL, A REDISCOVERY OF RESOLVE, 
AND A REBIRTH OF DEVOTION.
WE NEED TO DEFEAT THE ENEMIES OF
HUMANITY AND UNLOCK THE 
POTENTIAL OF LIFE ITSELF.
OUR HOPE IS A WORD AND WORLD OF 
PROUD, INDEPENDENT NATIONS THAT 
EMBRACE THEIR DUTIES, SEEK 
FRIENDSHIP, RESPECT OTHERS, AND 
MAKE COMMON CAUSE IN THE 
GREATEST SHARED INTEREST OF ALL,
A FUTURE OF DIGNITY AND PEACE 
FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS WONDERFUL
EARTH.
THIS IS THE TRUE VISION OF THE 
UNITED NATIONS, THE ANCIENT WISH
OF EVERY PEOPLE, AND THE DEEPEST
YEARNING THAT LIVES INSIDE EVERY
SACRED SOUL.
SO LET THIS BE OUR MISSION.
AND LET THIS BE OUR MESSAGE TO 
THE WORLD.
WE WILL FIGHT TOGETHER, 
SACRIFICE TOGETHER, AND STAND 
TOGETHER FOR PEACE, FOR FREEDOM,
FOR JUSTICE, FOR FAMILY, FOR 
HUMANITY, AND FOR THE ALMIGHTY 
GOD WHO MADE US ALL.
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU.
GOD BLESS THE NATIONS OF THE 
WORLD.
AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>>> RHETORIC THERE FROM 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN HIS 
FIRST ADDRESS TO THE U.N. 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
JUST OVER 40 MINUTES THERE WHERE
THE PRESIDENT MEDITATED ON THE 
THEME OF STRONG SOVEREIGN NATION
SAYING AT A TIME OF IMMENSE 
PERIL, HE WILL ALWAYS PUT 
AMERICA FIRST AS AMERICA'S 
PRESIDENT.
STRONGEST WORDS, TOUGHEST WORDS 
FOR NORTH KOREA IN THIS SPEECH.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF 
GR
GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANCHOR, MARTHA 
RADDATZ.
HE SAID IF THE UNITED STATES IS 
FORCE TO DEFEND OURSELVES 
AGAINST NORTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA
WILL BE TOTALLY DESTROYED, EVEN 
USED HIS ANY NICKNAME FOR KIM 
JONG-UN, ROCKET MAN. 
>> HE SURE DID, GEORGE.
THESE ARE THE STRONGEST WORDS WE
HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT SAY AND 
CERTAINLY MADE MUCH STRONGER 
BECAUSE OF THE SETTING, BECAUSE 
HE IS SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE 
WORLD.
THESE WERE NOT OFF-THE-CUFF 
REMARKS.
THIS WAS NOT A TWEET.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIRE AND 
FURY COMMENTS FROM LAST MONTH, 
BUT THIS BEFORE THE WORLD BODY 
SAYING THEY WOULD TOTALLY 
DESTROY NORTH KOREA.
IT'S A VERY SOBERING MESSAGE FOR
KIM JONG-UN, SOMETHING HE IS 
UNDOUBTEDLY LISTENING TO. 
>> HE'S LISTENING.
THE NORTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR 
ACTUALLY WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM 
BY THE TIME THE PRESIDENT SPOKE.
THE PRESIDENT SAID 
DENUCLEARIZATION, NORTH KOREA 
GETTING RID OF ITS NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS THE ONLY OPTION.
I WANT TO BRING IN TERRY MORMOR.
TERRY, A VERY UNAPOLOGETIC 
SPEECH FROM TRUMP. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS THE REVENGE OF THE 
NATIONS STATE THIS WAS MEANT TO 
BRING THE NATIONS TOGETHER AFTER
THEY TORE THE WORLD APART IN 
WORLD WAR II.
EVERY AMERICAN PRESIDENT SINCE 
THEN HAS AT LEAST PAID LIP 
SERVICE TO THIS NOTION OF 
BRINGING THE NATIONS TOGETHER 
UNDER THE eJIS OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS.
THIS WAS VERY DIFFERENT.
HE SAID SOMETHING THAT VLADIMIR 
PUTIN WOULD HAVE SAID, NO 
QUESTION ABOUT IT, WHEN HE SAID 
WE DO NOT EXPECT DIVERSE 
COUNTRIES TO SHARE THE SAME 
CULTURES, BUT WE DO EXPECT ALL 
NATIONS TO UPHOLD TWO CORE 
SOVEREIGN DUTIES, TO RESPECT THE
INTERESTS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE 
AND THE RIGHTS OF EVERY OTHER 
SOVEREIGN NATION.
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF DICTATORS 
AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING 
VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO SAY THE SAME 
THING AND WILL HEAR THOSE WORDS,
HOWEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP MEANT 
THEM AS A LICENSE TO DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE. 
>> THERE WAS ALSO VEILED 
CRITICISM OF VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 
CHINA WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 
PRESERVING SOVEREIGNTY FROM THE 
UKRAINE TO THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.
JONATHAN KARL, NOT ONLY TOUGH 
WORDS FOR NORTH KOREA, ALSO 
IRAN.
THE PRESIDENT SAID DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN HE WANTED TO RIP UP THE
IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT BUT HE'S 
DEFENDED IT OR ACCEPTED IT TO 
DATE.
THIS MAY NOT BE THE LAST WORD. 
>> HE DIDN'T SAY HE WAS GOING TO
RIP IT UP HERE BUT HE DID SAY 
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY, GEORGE.
HE CALLED THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL 
AN EMBARRASSMENT.
HE CALLED IT AN EMBARRASSMENT.
WHAT IS FASCINATING ABOUT THAT 
IS THIS IS AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS
NEGOTIATED BY THE PREVIOUS 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT, BARACK 
OBAMA, BUT ALSO WITH OUR 
STRONGEST ALLIES THERE IN THAT 
HALL.
AND HE SAID THAT AGREEMENT IS AN
EMBARRASSMENT.
WE HAVE NOT HEARD THE END OF IT.
UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL 
ULTIMATELY DO WHAT HE THREATENED
DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND RIP IT 
UP.
I WOULD SAY OVERALL, THIS WAS IN
MANY WAYS SERIOUS, SUBSTANTIVE, 
OFTEN POSITIVE SPEECH THAT 
INCLUDED AN EXTRAORDINARY 
THREAT.
I MEAN, GO BACK TO THAT NORTH 
KOREA, TO SAY TO TOTALLY DESTROY
NORTH KOREA IF WE ARE FORCED TO 
DEFEND OURSELVES. 
>> ABSOLUTE TERMS RIGHT THERE.
I WANT TO BRING MARTHA RADDATZ 
BACK IN AS WELL.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS 
IDEA OF RIPPING UP THE IRAN 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT NOT ONLY AS 
JON SAID THE FACT THAT OUR 
ALLIES SUPPORT IT BUT THE U.N. 
INSPECTORS SO FAR HAVE SAID THAT
IRAN IS ABIDING BY THAT NUCLEAR 
AGREEMENT. 
>> THEY HAVE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS SAID THEY ARE NOT ABIDING BY
THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENT, SO 
I THINK IT'S EXACTLY AS JON 
SAID.
HE HAS UNTIL OCTOBER 15th TO 
DECIDE WHAT HE'LL DO ABOUT THAT 
AGREEMENT.
I THINK CERTAINLY THE IRANIANS 
KNOW THEY WILL BE WATCHING VERY,
VERY CAREFULLY IF THEY GO 
BEYOND, AS THEY SAY, GOING 
AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE 
AGREEMENT.
BUT, GEORGE, I WANT TO GO BACK 
AGAIN JUST QUICKLY TO THAT NORTH
KOREA STATEMENT.
PEOPLE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE 
IS A MILITARY OPTION THE UNITED 
STATES COULD DESTROY NORTH 
KOREA, BUT NOT WITHOUT A GREAT 
LOSS OF LIFE IN SOUTH KOREA AND 
POSSIBLY TO U.S. FORCES AS WELL.
THIS IS A VERY BIG THREAT HE 
MADE. 
>> I WANT TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH
TERRY MORAN AS WELL.
IF YOU READ THE PRESIDENT'S 
WORDS, HE SAID THE CONDITIONS 
WOULD BE A FORCE TO DEFEND 
OURSELVES AND OUR ALLIES.
YOU CAN READ THAT POSSIBLY TO 
EVEN OPEN UP A JUSTIFICATION FOR
PREVENTATIVE WAR AGAINST NORTH 
KOREA.
>> THAT IS A POTENTIAL 
JUSTIFICATION, BUT THE WORDS 
TOTALLY DESTROYING A NATION OF 
25 MILLION PEOPLE, THAT BORDERS 
ON THE THREAT OF COMMITTING A 
WAR CRIME.
>> THAT IS GOING TO BE THE LAST 
WORD FOR US RIGHT NOW.
EXTRAORDINARY SPEECH FROM 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, THE 
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
TODAY, HIS FIRST SPEECH TO THE 
U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN NOW TO OUR
REGULAR PROGRAMMING.
