supply co.com for 50 bucks off and I know you're thinking wow I'm glad I'm still alive but how do you spell there is I just can't stop playing that uh you know after this conversation I really love just sitting with the guys talking about the things that men actually talk about that the conversation was more real than most of the things I hear people say about men the reason being that most of the things you hear say about men said about men are said by women who know nothing about the subject whatsoever except from their point of view and so I really thought that was great but you know there are things that only fathers know and as we approach Father's Day this is worth talking about it's worth talking about more than politics but it does relate to politics because there are things only father's find out you know I've written about this in my memoir the great good thing they did not have a good relationship with my father which is painful because he wasn't a bad person yeah he had a lot of integrity he was good to my mother he supported us and gave us a good life but he and I just did not get along and I remember when my daughter was born my first child my daughter faith bringing her home and I was terrified that I would not be as I thought I would be I wouldn't be a better father to her than my father was to me and I remember the minute I brought her home I thought that's too low a bar I could I can do that and the reason I felt that way the reason I felt that way is not because like I said my father wasn't a bad guy it was because my father it was a performer and he had that he and a comedian which is a particular kind of performer and he had that element of narcissism that a lot of performers a lot of artists have and when I say narcissism what I don't mean is he thought he was so great what I mean is that he didn't understand that other people who truly existed outside of his imagination I remember several times he said to me that when he was on a train or traveling through somewhere and he saw other people on the street he found it very difficult to imagine they went on living after he was gone and I think that made it impossible for him to separate from his sons and realize that we were different people and we might want different things and that was the thing that it's just it just happens to be weirdly true of me even though like all artists I have a very strong ego I mean an artist needs a strong because he spends time looking at himself and exploring himself and feeling that what he has to say is worthwhile which takes a certain amount of ego but I'm not a narcissist I'm very much aware that other people exist and in fact I think that fatherhood done right is the process of shining the light so that your kids can become themselves which sometimes can be uncomfortable there may be things about your kids that God made them that you are uncomfortable with there may be things that they think intellectually maybe they'll come back later on to things you like but they made distance themselves from ideas that you hold very dear but as long as your children are honest and steadfast and true in the world and faithful to and you know and have integrity and faithful to good values they are going to be different people and your job is to let them become that and leave them to themselves I mean that is your job as a dad and I think that that that act of letting go of yourself of not making it about yourself of not making your kids imitate you and yet being yourself so that they can see what that's like you know I liken it's it's kind of a corny metaphor but it's a good one that a mother is kind of if a child is like a plant a mother is like the earth yeah that feeds them nurtures them it comes it come they come out of her but a father is like the son and that they grow toward him and they can see by who he is you know what what they are supposed to be like that's especially important for sons but obviously important for daughters as well so they know what a good man looks like and I think I you know I used to say to my wife you know it's not enough for us to do right we have to love doing right we have to be joyful in the right so they don't think like well you know I have to do these things because mom and dad want me to know I wanted them to say this is the joyful way of life because it is and and you know this this thing about letting yourself go letting other people become themselves is it works in friendship it works in in being a husband as well it's part of the whole you know it's part of the whole thing we you know it it feeds into the love of country which is letting yourself putting the country before your personal welfare or the things you like if Barack Obama does something right you may dislike Barack Oh I mean that never was a problem but if he does something right you say okay he got it right why because you love the country more than you love yourself you love the country more than you love your political party you love the things the principles for which your country stands the freedom even more than you love your country and and so you know when I see when I've seen for instance I didn't like Donald Trump but when I see that he's doing a good job I let go of it I let go of the fact you know I was wrong hey that's gonna happen that happened once in 1962 I think I was also wrong you know it doesn't matter to me I'd so much rather be wrong about Donald Trump and have my country thrive so much rather than be right about Donald Trump say see he did destroy things just like I thought he was you know on the show yesterday we had a question I don't think well I got to answer it a little bit but I didn't get to fully answer but putting my thing the conversation just kind of went on its way somebody asked why is God a father in the Bible and of course God is not gender the way we are gendered but we think of him as a father and you know we have the father and his son and why is that and one of the reasons I think it is is because like fathers God makes us but we are not part of him we're not deists we believe that God that this is creation this is something God made you're always sort of part of your mother you came out of your mother you're always connected to her and some it's essential way but a father is really leading you to yourself so that you can be free and and God is doing the same thing and and he doesn't in this invisible manner one of the things about being a father's you're not looking to be thanked you're not looking you know obviously you want to be appreciated but you understand that the when it rains and your kids don't get wet they don't look around and say dad that's that dad I'd like him you know he put a roof over my head you know you understand that that's not what's happening you know honest on a kind of a sigh a side note that a lot of times it's it's hard for people to define the good I write about this in my novel werewolf cop is that where one of the guys says you know bad things are active you know rape murder killing you know bad things but when you think about good things you often think about people who are stopping bad things just think about the doctor who heals diseases you think about the cop who stops crime you think about the fireman who puts out a fire it's almost as if that evil is essential and good is contingent and it only looks that way because being itself is good because the life itself is good the creation of God itself is good so it's really the evil that's contingent the evil is contingent on life and the people who are doing good to stop the evil are in fact in support of life it is the being that is good and that's God's invisible goodness and God operates you know Aristotle said this is God you know we people talk about God is the prime mover the mover who is not moved and people think of that as him pushing the rock uphill or you know turning the machinery but in fact he operates by drawing us invisibly to himself and that is what makes us move his love so here's the thing people look for father's in the world and especially if they didn't have a father they look for other fathers and I had a mentor a shrink who saved my life and he was a mentor to me the only mentor I've ever had but politicians are not your father the president is not your father the president is much more like a boss he's doing something he's not your dad and I've been watching the left over these days of this summit with Kim jong-un the summit and the g7 summit and can in Canada and the rage that they're expressing a rage at the time of prosperity a time of more freedom than we had under Obama a time of finding our way back to constitutional living and constitutional law a time when Isis has been destroyed and the rage they're expressing he's it's not political anymore it is psychological and it is a rage that Trump is not acting the role of their father because they think the government is their dad and that is the whole thing if you have a king maybe maybe then but in our in our way of government this freedom oriented way of government the president is just the CEO he's just running the company and he may not be you know people pick on me that I say I talk about how Rudy is or all his personal flaws but that's because I want to remind you he's there to do a job he's there to do a job we are here to talk about whether the job is being done well or not and we're talking about it over time you know we're talking about is he doing it well over time not how how is he doing at every single moment the rage this rage that is coming out of Hollywood that is coming out of the news media this absolute I mean it's not but like I said it's not political when you say when you say I disagree with this man I never went after Obama like this I remember people attacking me on the right because I wouldn't say that Obama was evil I thought if you think Obama is evil you do not know what evil looks like we are so spoiled in America that even when we have a bad president and Obama is the worst president in my lifetime he's still not evil he's just wrong he's just mistaken he's got all kinds of flaws but the thing that got me about you know Robert De Niro we saw him skewing you know curses he went to Canada and he's apologizing to Canada for our president I mean they and it would be amazing if John McCain weren't doing the same thing but just listen to DeNiro it's a disgrace and I apologize to just the $2 - it's disgusting he's Baha apologizing on behalf of rage-filled twisted irrelevant people because that's who he represents at this point people who have are psychologically disjointed because Donald Trump will not play dad but will simply do the job that he was hired to do and listen I prefer Donald Trump had a better character as a person but he is doing a really really good job he by the way his response to DeNiro absolutely hilarious he said he tweeted out Robert DeNiro a very low IQ individual he got a love has received so many too many shots to the head by real boxers and movies I watched him last night and truly believe he may be punch-drunk I guess he doesn't realize the economy that is the best it's ever been with employment being at an all-time high and many companies pouring back into our country wake up punchy I think that that I have that put up on a plaque over the wall wake up country but wake up punchy but all this you know inability to see what's happening is this inability to put yourself aside that you're not being fathered you're not being dad is not in the house but a guy is doing a job for your country it put that aside and celebrated in the news media of course I mean all week long I've been busting our guy's chops making them put these montages together but I don't want to go through every news guy I mean this here is the absurd reactions again I want to say and I was I was really happy that a lot of smart come commentators like Byron York and people like that said the same thing I said yesterday is we don't know how this is gonna work out but he tried something new when we know what was happening was leading in a slow steady way to complete nuclear nuclear armament of North Korea we know that so we don't know if this change of pace if this new trumpian way of doing things is gonna work and if it works great and if it doesn't work we can discuss why it didn't work but we never have to hate on them now when we have no answers yet so here's just a quick montage of the lovely news media reacting I'm wondering here did you need to have this summit in order to get what these two people got this little letter a lot of the reason why we were on the brink of nuclear war last year I mean part of it to be sure was because of the North Korean nuclear test and their missile test but also because of the reckless and irresponsible rhetoric from Donald Trump a ratcheting up the tensions and so now this is kind of the arsonist getting credit for putting out the fire but what's striking to me about the summit is how little Donald Trump got in return for legitimating kim janggun on the world stage he's coming out with kiss but that's a range it it's outrageous the way he talks this guy's a killer I want to bring it back to the menu for a second not just because I'm hungry but because typically the White House releases these kinds of details after for example the french president comes to the White House or another head of state comes for a state visit so by releasing the details of the menu this is again legitimizing kim jongwan they're talking about nuclear weapons and she's criticizing the menu she's talking what's on the menu listen you know here's Donald Trump I've talked about this before and I'll talk about it more another day Donald Trump is in motion he's always you know I can't remember if I said this yesterday but you remember when Barack Obama said you know I I don't support gay marriage and the left didn't say a word why cuz they knew he was lying they knew he wasn't telling the truth so they didn't care whether he said I don'ts we knew it was political when Trump says Kim jong-un is a good person he's not saying Kim jong-un is a good person he's saying hey fatty I'm gonna flatter you up Batman and then get rid of your nukes in or we'll blow you to kingdom come that's what he's doing he's in a process all the time and so when you're judging Trump because he acts like this and I can say good things and bad things about it but the things are going so well here's the thing the general picture is good why is that important because you know William James great philosopher William James he was the brother of Henry James might one of my absolute favorite novelist William James said wisdom is largely a matter of knowing what to overlook and with Trump you've got to overlook a lot yeah you do yeah after a that's not that's not giving him a pass for things that's simply saying this is the guy he is this is what he's doing and overall things are going well so let's overlook some things that is not a that is not a terrible terrible thing to say and it's not compromising certainly not compromising my values which are very practical I love my country I love my country more than being right I love my country more than picking on people I love my country more than party I love my country because it represents a kind of freedom that never existed on earth before my country existed and I hope it continues to do that and Trump is helping that and that seems to me to be what matters but however I have to say this there are some ways the Trump is like a father there are some ways the Trump is like a father if you take the kind of dysfunctional father who still gives guys something that they can hang on to you know the guy who is maybe he drinks too much maybe cheats on mom but he was terrible a terrible guy because every now and again he does something where you go like yes that is something a man should do first of all we you know I've been concerned I am really happy with the things Trump dislikes and I've said this all week I'm happy with the things Trump dislikes I'm happy that he dislikes a global global world that is not keyed into American values I'm happy that he understands that national borders mean something that national might mean something especially for America which is going to be taxed with with controlling this global world this world that is inevitably becoming global but I worry that he doesn't that he doesn't have a plan you know that you know I when he talked the other day about how the real estate in North Korea was great I thought that's Trump Trump thinks you know black people are gonna love me because they're gonna have jobs he thinks you know why would you blow up why would you build nuclear weapons when you could build a condo on the beach and make a lot of money that is Donald Trump to me that is the best thing about him and it really is it really is a good thing about him that he's a practical guy he's not expressed he's not giving the Gettysburg Address he's not reexpress in the founding ideals he's talking about like practical knowledge and practical wisdom and capitalist wisdom above all the thing is though he has been saying the same thing for a long time CNN Wolf Blitzer played a cut of an interview with him about North Korea from 1999 so there's almost 20 years ago now and he's saying the same thing then he was saying he's saying now listen to this North Korea is totally out of control and would you rather have a very very serious chat with them now and if necessary you might have to do something fairly drastic or would you rather have to go after them in five years when they have more nuclear warheads and missiles than we do what if their North Koreans don't play ball develop a nuclear capability go forward with their missile development does the United States act the unilateral excuse me if if spoken to correctly correctly they will play ball look on another front what happened recently where Clinton has asked our trade our so-called trade partners to come so we can renegotiate some fairness into trade right they don't show up they say we're not coming why would Germany show up why would France show up why would you pan show up they've been ripping this off for years so why would they come here it's ridiculous so he's saying the same thing then that he's saying now and he's talking about the way he talks right so remember he brought Kim jong-un to this negotiation by calling him little rocket man threatening to say my button is bigger than your a button Hannity talks to him about this and it's really wonderful this is kind of dad because he's very honest about the fact that he's not very honest so this is cut number 11 a lot of people critics quickly saying when you said a little rocket man or fire and fury or you know when he said oh I've got a red button on my desk he said well mine's bigger and it works better than yours how did we had it it evolved from that to this because he did say at the very beginning we're going to basically start over and what that has been building behind the scenes well I think without the rhetoric we wouldn't have been here I really believe that you know we did sanctions and all of the things that you would do but I think without the rhetoric you know other administration's I don't want to get specific on that but they had a policy of silence if they said something very bad and very threatening and horrible just don't answer that's not the answer that's not what you have to do so I think the rhetoric I hated to do it sometimes I felt foolish doing it but we had no choice yeah you know as a guy who is in my for youth who was in a lot of fistfights the times he get out of fistfights you avoid fistfights by just being as mean and nasty and loud as you can possibly be and so he that's a perfectly good ploy and I love the fact that he admits it I also love that he admitted this that where he talked about he says look I'm trying this it might not work this is cut number seven I think he's gonna do these things I may be wrong I mean I may stand before you in six months and say hey I was wrong I don't know that I'll ever admit that but I'll find us I'll find some kind of an excuse that's very dead see that so that's a very manly very you know like yeah I'll never admit I'm wrong it's not gonna happen but at least I'll admit that I'll never admit I'm wrong listen to Joy Behar the voice of screechie angry Hagee you know are miserable feminism listen to her react to that Trump said if I'm wrong I will admit it Yeah right when pigs right Donald Trump is a vulgar demented Pig demon he's a big demon but she didn't even listen to what he said he said he'll never admit he's wrong he said that he admitted it but she can't hear it anyway I just think that Trump so far is doing a terrific job he really is and we're just gonna have to live with the fact that he's not daddy he's the President of the United States listen if you haven't already found this out the Andrew Clavin show is now available on Amazon Alexa and the Google home device if you use one of these virtual

person who has to be anonymous which you're perfectly willing to welcome to do dear Andrew this is the first time that I've written I want to share with you somewhat of a Gary Carter moment I had with you on yesterday's show it's a reference to my memoir the great good thing at my lowest point in life a great baseball player made a comment that really helped me out over the radio Gary Carter great catcher for the New York Mets my teenage daughter has been depressed lately and I've been it's been a total shock to us she started cutting which is really a difficult thing that's kids cutting themselves with knives just to feel something just to wake themselves up that scared me and so we sought therapy she's also expressed a suicidal ideation which led us to place her on medications all of this literally happened at the time of your crappy culture segment when you said essentially drugs are not enough but it takes Christian love and that discussion seemed more than just serendipity to me I do believe that is how God actually talks to people through others at the right time I want to show my daughter that Christian love and currently she won't open up into me I do think I might have some anger issues which are causing a block but what else can I attend it help what else can i to help her with I've tried a lot of things and maybe it's because I don't listen enough any thoughts can help if you do read this please don't use my name I wouldn't even have written but a strong will came over me and I thought they needed to alright I I can answer this question you know when first of all you're right if you have anger issues you're gonna have to overcome them and I talked about this yesterday on the Father's Day show kids play every note on your piano they press every key on your piano if you got a problem you got to fix it because they are gonna hit that broke in place and bring it to light so you have got to work on that in yourself that is something that she needs I mean she is in bad shape if she's cutting she is in bad shape she needs your help she needs everybody help help and she needs your love I've often talked to conservatives who want to talk about the culture and they want conservative culture and what they think they mean is they want culture that looks conservative and I always say to them conservative culture doesn't look conservative the sopranos is conservative you know it's like it's just not because it's not an old thing like King you don't recognize that the violence is speaking through conservative values the same thing is true if Christian love Christian love does not always look Christian and that is shocking to some people but it is the truth when you think about the way God handles you does he come down and say do this do that these are you know you got to do this now through this no he's really there listening to you and if you lit and if you follow him you can find your way but he doesn't come and tell you at every moment what to do I I have worked on these hotlines and sometimes people call up these hotlines I've worked with a lot of kids on hotlines who are cutting themselves I've worked with a lot of people who are doing stupid stupid things and what they don't need is for me to tell them they're doing something stupid or wrong I had a conversation once with a kid who had joint who had joined it was worshipping Satan okay now you know you don't have to ask how I feel about that but did I say to him that's evil you stop no stop doing had I done that it's handing him over to the devil it's handing him over to the devil I listen to him with love I listen to him with acceptance I tried to find out what was hurting in him I tried to find out what I played as they say in in these businesses they say steer toward the pain I tried to find out what it's because the thing is pal it's not about you it's about her it's about her it's about your daughter you've got to love your daughter enough to leave your anger behind you got to love your daughter enough to leave your righteousness behind you got to leave your daughter you got to love your daughter enough to leave behind things that you may think are important and listen to her because that love will be like the light and will shut will guide her to the light right whereas if you're just screaming at her and you're just telling her and you're explaining to her you're not giving her any chance to grow into herself she's in big trouble I'm glad you got her therapy but I think she needs you to listen to her without judgment and to steer toward the pain and find out what's hurting her and to show her that you love her no matter who she is or what she's doing and that is the best thing you can do for her because that will give her the light she needs to grow into from Jacob hey drew I've got to admit you give the most fair shake on the trump presidency I've heard do you think anyone on the Left poses a serious threat to president Trump's election campaign personally I think most of them have lost all touch with the reality and we're just enjoying the comedy show of FFA thank you for your daily forty-five minutes of sheer insight well thank you very much for that you know it's too early to tell and I'm not in the business of guessing what people who people are going to elect you know I've heard it said that Joe Biden has has a lot of Appeal among the same working-class of blue-collar people who voted for Trump I don't think I don't think Joe Biden is going anywhere personally you know right this minute if the election were right this minute I think he would win 40 states I think that he is on track to score a tremendous reelection victory but nobody knows the future of the futures not ours to see and it's way way too far away he's doing a great job and that thing is that talks to people that speaks to people the fact that he is doing a great job and all the news in the world all the spin in the world is not going to erase that force from Spencer hi mr. Clavin I listened to both your interview on the bad Christian podcast and to the subsequent follow-up by the podcast with propaganda who I guess is a rap star or something yeah I don't know but do you have any thoughts on the things they took issue with a they attack me on the show you know I didn't hear this until I got your letter and then I started listening to it and then I was called in to do the Father's Day show so I didn't hear enough of that what I the part that I heard I thought was ridiculous they were kind of attacking they were you know whenever I talk about Christian non judgment judge not lest you be judged it drives people crazy the one thing Christians and everybody else don't want to let go of is their right to condemn and judge other people as if they were God they do not want to let it go and I say you know Jesus said judge not lest you be judged that's not what it means it's like oh why did he say it then you know why did he said the other thing that people don't want to let go of is their sense of victimhood and when I heard them the part that I heard on the bad Christian podcast reacting to me was that nasty Andrew Clavin he's going to take away our sense of victimhood and he was they were talking about the fact that black people do in fact suffer in America and I never said they don't what I said was you can't solve the past and wallowing in your victimhood is not to help you and that is just true you have to let it go and it's easy for me to say this is one of the things that's so painful for them is it's easy for me to say because I'm not going through it but it you know just to give an example you know I think it is different for a black person to deal with a cop in America than it is for a white person to deal with the cop I don't think that's the cops fault I think that's the fault of the criminals who are black who have taught that cop that he's got to take a little extra care with black people that's that is who you blame but the thing about it is is if you are going to wallow in that if that's what your life is gonna be about you're gonna have a crappy life if your life is gonna be waiting for history to come back and and say there saw its sorry for slavery or waiting for some kind of monetary recompense for something that didn't happen to you taking money away from somebody who didn't do anything to you you are going to have a crappy life that is going to be a bad life if your life is about excellence well you are made what God has made you that is going to be a good life and that's what I said and they don't want to give it up in the same way a lot of Christians don't want to give up the right to judge people's sins they didn't want to give up their right to victimhood that was the part I heard maybe they said other things I'm not always right well yes I am come on that's a I guess I could pretend to be modest without feelings from Kyle to the all-knowing Titan Clavin keeper of the Infinity stones like Catholic baptized and raised in the Catholic Church during college I fell away but I eventually found my way back and then realized that the cat Catholic Church wasn't working for me I couldn't get that strong sense of God in my life that I used to have so I tried going to a Baptist Church and it was incredible I truly felt God in that church for the first time in years so I think I'm going to continue attending how do I tell my all Catholic family and how do I know this is the right decision for me in my mind I know the Catholic Church to be the true church but in my heart I feel this new church provides me a much stronger connection to my faith and to God well that's the problem you have to solve if if your mind is telling you that the Catholic Church is the true church you've got to figure out whether it's your heart or mind that is wrong I mean the whole trick to life in a lot of ways is making sure that your feelings are in line with reality so if you're having feelings about the Baptist Church but your mind is saying no you know reasonably I can see the Catholic Church is the true faith that's the problem you got to solve it's not that how you break it to people you're gonna break if you know you break it to people by telling them the truth and is gentle away as possible that's not your problem your problem is solving that division which I can't solve for you I mean why what is the Baptist Church giving you that the Catholic Church is not giving you and if the Catholic Church is not giving it to you is it the true faith and if if the Baptist or if the Baptist Church is giving it to you is there something that you want that is not the true faith it's only one it can only be one of those two possibilities little compact put that another complicated way but the point is either the Catholic Church is the true faith or it's not it can't be it can't be both so that's the problem you gotta solve but you have to break it to people you break it to people that you know with all the courage you can muster from Andrew dear divine master of both what can and cannot be I bet that it's not on my business card yet but it will me now I've been with my girlfriend for over five years and all I hear from other people is one of you two getting married my typical answer is that it isn't worth getting the government in the mix when I already have everything I need we don't have kids yet but are planning to start late next year we both share almost identical values respect the importance of family and are still very much in love we we're also not very religious so the idea of a ceremony would mostly be for show also we both get along great with the in-laws so there's no family drama other than a tax break and shared health insurance what could be a good reason to be recognized as a married couple by the state love the show we watch you guys every day all right you asked so I'm gonna answer get married okay and it has nothing to do with the government all that stuff all that like hyper-rational stuff is missing the point that you know you can rationalize actual life away not all of life is rational some of life is inexpressible right that's why we have art to express the things that are inexpressible that is also why we have ceremonies to express the things that are inexpressible I know this because I made the same mistake when I got married I was living with my girlfriend who has now been my wife for 38 years as of May 31st and is I was living with her I thought why should I get married you know but you know I thought now you know we want to have kids and I want the kids that my name and you know we want to be a family and also I'll get married the minute the ceremony was over I thought ah I have just accidentally done the smartest thing in my life years later when I was baptized I made the same stupid mistake because I am nothing if not stubborn in my stupidity it's ID like when you have stupidity you want to hold onto it with everything you've got and when I was baptized I thought I'm already a Christian why do I need to be baptized but it's a ceremony I'll go do the ceremony the minute I stood up from the font I thought oh my god I did this I mean the same stupid mistake thank God he dragged me over the finish line and got me to do this thing the thing that marriage expresses is inexpressible the thing the ceremony expresses is inexpressible do it any way you want do it with anybody you want it's not about the state it's not about the tax break it is going through that ceremony that expresses with your that physically expresses the inexpressible that binds you to your bride and makes you a family and makes you a man you will find it out two seconds after the ceremony is over do it especially if you're gonna have kids you asked I'm telling you from Samuel dear Clavin the wise I really hope you read this as I cannot imagine getting a brighter mind to lead my heart to safety I'm a 17 year old high school junior getting ready for senior year over the past couple of months as the horizon of adulthood comes nearer to me I found myself dealing with an enormous amount of anxiety I have no idea what to do after school I have no idea what I want to be or even what I can be I know that maybe I should have learned all this by now from my parents and even from programs like your own where you discuss the importance of manhood father of humanity etc but what is all of this to me now I don't know how to apply all of this information and so I'm now faced with the most frightening possibility I could be a failure I could fail to live up to that divine intention if you will and to be honest I don't know how to cope I know this is a long message but I really appreciate a response if you could I can't possibly imagine living the life so empty without Direction love the show first of all Samuel relax okay this is this is not on you this is on God God will take care of you on this here is what I think you should do okay you're 17 years old and 17 not a lot of people know where they're going some people have the benefit of a vocation some people have the benefit of good parenting that taught them things that they need to know good teaching you're feeling lost that it's completely normal what you need is you need more time and you need to be doing something that that is it organizes your life for you the military Valen hearing for you know AmeriCorps going overseas something like that after you get out of school right now the smartest thing you could do I would I would do something like take karate seriously I would going to start a karate class something your seventeen-year-old guy you got a lot of energy you got to be doing something really physical I don't know what your abilities are even running would be okay but I would do something with other people karate is great because it's not necessarily competitive but you get to learn the values of sports if you if you want to play a sport do that I would do that now in your last in your senior year just to start organizing your mind to start getting some values inculcated into your body after that listen college the military AmeriCorps something that gives you a mission something that gives you a mission with other people something that gives you a sense of discipline you will find your way and also trust a god he's got you he has got your back on this he will lead you through your best self you cannot fail if you follow God you cannot you cannot he will not let you you will fail on a day on a given day but you will not fail altogether relax you're exactly where you're supposed to be you know don't pass just you're just panicking don't panic it will be okay but but do take the actions take the actions that you need to get organized to get your mind organized to give yourself over to a sense of values a community sense of values we're gonna take one more of these these are really good questions I hate to I hate to stop but I really have to from Levi first I would like to thank you for your role in my young middle school adolescent self because you wrote one miss call a horror movie and that got me to hold hands with the cute girl in my school she's just scared that those were hard movies before getting the girl to jump into your lap all right I have a question about liberal art degrees in college I love the arts and at a time majored in music I think that the arts from painting to literature to music all play a special role in our culture I also recognize that these degrees end up being over priced and not efficient as a path for a career other than teaching music I was wondering your thoughts on the situation I was an English major I used to joke that it was a pre short-order chef degree it was completely useless you know I was sorry I did it I wish I had taken something more rock-solid like history or something like that I knew I knew I wanted to be a right I was very committed to being a writer the problem now is you got together with the liberal arts have been taken over by the left they don't teach you the real stuff you you should learn about art you are a person who should learn about art and culture you should read the great books get AG list of the hundred great books read them you should go to the Opera you should study painting you should do all those things whether you need to do it in college it's a just a different question I'm not totally against it but you should kind of take take stock what are you going to college for what do you want to do afterwards what is your degree gonna help you do and then do that because College is right now a utilitarian thing it is not what it used to be because the liberal arts have been taken over by the left and destroyed so study the arts use your time do it you know find that stuff out but whether you have to do it in college is something you have to figure out according to what you want to be if you want to be a teacher that would be a good thing to do if you want to be a writer maybe that's the right thing to do but if you want to be an engineer study engineering and learn the arts on the side you should because you obviously love alright we gotta go to tickety-boo news couple of really great stories that illustrate and here's what they illustrate they illustrate that the right we have a tendency on the right to be a little bit pessimistic okay one of the reasons we're conservatives and we can see how any change could lead to disaster and that's just not true right and it's also not true that everything is indelible and nothing can be taken back Seattle they passed this stupid law where they were going to tax every full-time employee over a certain number of employees was going to be a tax on the company 272 five dollars why because they've screwed up with their homelessness policy people are living on the streets so this was going to make affordable housing well the homeless policy is not going to be solved by affordable housing it should be solved by shelters and mental health care but but you cannot say to businesses come to Seattle and will tax you to death so that tax has now been already repealed because reality stepped in and reality as we always say here has a voice the other news that was really interesting is there were more primary primaries and Trump is having them fact Trump is having an effect on the primaries which may speak to what the midterms are going to look like congressman Mark Sanford and cat in South Carolina he was a guy the Trump was tweeting about him saying this guy's been nothing but trouble he was tossed out Heidi Heitkamp who has actually been who's in Nevada right she's yes senator Nevada no I'm sorry North Carolina North Carolina she put out this ad basically saying I'm with Trump don't throw me out I'm with Trump I'm Heidi Heitkamp and when I ran for the Senate six years ago I said I wouldn't vote the party line because I don't think either party has all the right answers that's why I voted over half the time with President Trump and that made a lot of people in Washington man but when I agree with him I vote with him and if his policies hurt North Dakota he knows I'll speak up I approve this message because I'm not going to be a rubber stamp for anybody I only answer to you you go Heidi and let's compare that to Richard Madol they know who's running in a primary for governor of Maryland and put out what has got to be and this is a hard contest to win has got to be the stupidest campaign ad I have ever seen watch this here are a few of the things I've done that already infuriate him I protected Planned Parenthood from the Republicans in Congress I helped man assault weapons in Maryland I believe in public schools not voucher and what's the number one way I piss off Donald Trump and the Republicans take that Trump multiply because if you're not watching he kisses his husband boyfriend I have no idea because kisses his lover as male lover and that's gonna but really bother Donald Trump that's what Donald Trump goes to bed worrying about whether people are gay you know they say the most Pro gay president we have ever elected and that's what he thinks and I love the other things I love the other things it's like yes you know I'm for killing babies in the womb and yes I'm for destroying the Second Amendment and by golly your kids are gonna have to go to public school and there's poor little munchkins are going yay take that true wait a minute we're screwed let's see this guy's running in fourth place so we're gonna see which of these two people Heidi I gave her this clown have got it right because I sincerely believe that if Trump continues to do the good job that he is doing reality has a voice people are going to support him and the trumpian candidates the people who support his agenda are going to go to Congress and that happens I got to tell you if we do not if the Republicans do not lose the house in the midterms it is going to be a bombshell that is something there's going to change the landscape entirely he is is larry elder coming in tomorrow larry elder the sage of south central will be in the studio with us tomorrow be there I will be there too I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin
