FREDDY WANT TO GET YOUR REACTIOA
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TONIGHT
FREDDY WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION
IMPASSIONED -- I THINK IT WAS
"THE MOMENT" OTHER THAN
KAVANAUGH'S OPENING STATEMENT.
THE MOMENT OF THE DAY FROM
LINDSEY GRAHAM.
LET'S WATCH.
>> IF YOU WANTED AN FBI
INVESTIGATION, YOU COULD HAVE
COME TO US.
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY
THIS GUY'S LIFE, HOLD THIS SEAT
OPEN, AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020.
YOU HAVE SAID THAT.
NOT ME.
IF YOU HAVE GOT NOTHING TO
APOLOGIZE FOR.
WHEN YOU SEE SONIA SOTOMAYOR AND
ELENA KAGAN -- I VOTED FOR THEM.
I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT
YOU DID TO THE SKY.
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SHAM
SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS.
ARE YOU A GANG RAPIST?
>> NO.
>> I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY ARE GOING THROUGH.
BOY, Y'ALL WANT POWER.
I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT.
TO HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN
SEE THROUGH THIS SHAM, THAT
YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU HELD
IT.
GOD, I HATE THIS.
THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIEND.
BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHEN IT
COMES TO THIS.
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FAIR
PROCESS, YOU CAME TO THE WRONG
TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME, MY
FRIEND.
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF
YOU VOTE NO, YOU ARE
LEGITIMIZING THE MOST DESPICABLE
THING I HAVE SEEN IN MY TIME IN
POLITICS.
>> Laura: NEWT, I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT MOMENT
AND I'VE BEEN IN THIS TOWN FOR
ALMOST 30 YEARS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT.
YOUR REACTION TO THAT PIVOTAL
MOMENT?
>> I THINK THAT MOMENT JUSTIFIED
LINDSEY GRAHAM'S ENTIRE CAREER.
HE WAS COURAGEOUS, BLUNT,
HONEST, DIRECT, EMOTIONAL, AND
EFFECTIVE.
THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST
DESPICABLE BEHAVIOR BY A MAJOR
PARTY IN MODERN HISTORY.
THIS IS A DELIBERATE, VICIOUS
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, HURT
THE GUY'S DAUGHTERS, HURT HIS
MOTHER, HURT HIS WIFE, HURT HIS
REPUTATION.
THEY DIDN'T CARE.
YOU ARE WATCHING PEOPLE ON THAT
PANEL, DEMOCRATS ON THAT PANEL,
WHO KNOW IT'S A LIE.
THEY KNOW IT'S A LIE.
THEY KNOW THE WAY THAT FEINSTEIN
DID THIS WAS UTTERLY, TOTALLY
DESPICABLE.
THEY WENT ALONG.
MY BIG QUESTION IS, IS THERE A
SINGLE DEMOCRAT WITH THE GUTS TO
STAND UP AND VOTE FOR THIS JUDGE
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THIS IS
SICKENING.
I WANT TO SEE WHETHER IT IS JOE
MANCHIN OR HEIDI HEITKAMP OR ANY
OF THEM.
DO THEY HAVE THE GUTS TO STAND
UP TO THE LEFT AND SAY, THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT IS WRONG WITH
MODERN AMERICA?
BECAUSE THIS IS A DESPICABLE ACT
OF UTTER CHARACTER ASSASSINATION
BY PEOPLE WHO FRANKLY HAVE
BEHAVED IN AN EVIL WAY, UNWORTHY
OF THE UNITED STATES.
>> Laura: WE HAD HEIDI
HEITKAMP AS A POSSIBILITY, JOE
MANCHIN LOOKS LIKE HE COULD BE
VOTING YES.
SOMEONE LIKE JOE DONNELLY,
CLAIRE McCASKILL, THIS IS
WHERE FAIRNESS AND BASIC SENSE
OF DECENCY, YOU WOULD THINK
WOULD KICK IN BECAUSE THE TABLES
CAN BE TURNED ON THE DEMOCRATS,
NEWT.
ALTHOUGH THE REPUBLICANS WOULD
NEVER DO THIS.
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING BECAUSE
YOU MENTION IT, NEWT.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND THE LEAK.
BOTH MIKE LEE AND JOHN CORNYN
TRIED TO HIT HER ON THIS IDEA
THAT THIS DOCUMENT JUST KIND OF
APPEARED FROM HER OFFICE AND
ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF THE
PRESS.
LET'S WATCH.
>> CAN YOU TELL US THAT YOUR
STAFF DID NOT LEAK IT?
>> I DON'T BELIEVE MY STAFF
WOULD LEAK IT.
I HAVE NOT ASKED THAT QUESTION
DIRECTLY.
>> DO YOU KNOW THAT?
I MEAN, HOW IN THE WORLD DID
THAT GET IN THE HANDS OF THE
PRESS?
>> THE ANSWER IS NO.
THE STAFF DID NOT.
>> HAVE YOU ASK YOUR STAFF OR
>> Laura:         >> I ALREADY D
OTHER STAFF --
>> Laura:         >> I ALREADY .
>> THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?
>> PARTED ME -- JENNIFER RIDES
ME THAT I BACKED HER BEFORE.
>> SOMEBODY LEAKED IT IF IT
WASN'T YOU.
>> Laura: WAIT A SECOND, SHE
JUST SAID HER STAFF, SHE DIDN'T
ASK HER STAFF, WHICH IS
UNBELIEVABLE, IF A DOCUMENT
LEAKS FROM YOUR OFFICE, AND THEN
SHE SAYS, OH, NO, SHE JUST
REMINDED ME I DID.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST A
SHATTERING MOMENT FOR
DIANNE FEINSTEIN PRAY THAT WAS
ONE OF THE MOST EMBARRASSING
MOMENTS OF THIS WHOLE DAY.
>> I THINK THAT
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, WHO WAS ONCE
A RESPONSIBLE AND HONORABLE
PERSON, FOR WHATEVER REASON,
MAYBE BECAUSE SHE IS CHALLENGED
FROM THE LEFT IN CALIFORNIA AND
THE ELECTION THIS YEAR, BUT FOR
WHATEVER REASON, THIS HAS ALL
GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL.
THE FACT IS THE REPUBLICANS ARE
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THE
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THT
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THI
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, TH-
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THT
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THI
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THS
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THC
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THU
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THD
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THH
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THV
TO FILE ETHICS CHARGES, THEY
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THE
BEEN HANDLED IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE SUMMER.
SHE HAD THE LETTER.
SHE COULD HAVE BROUGHT IT IN AN
ORDERLY WAY, THEY COULD HAVE HAD
A REASONABLE CONVERSATION, THEY
HAVE DELIBERATELY CREATED --
THIS IS ALL DELIBERATE.
NONE OF THIS IS AN ACCIDENT.
THEY HAVE DELIBERATELY CREATED A
FIRESTORM OF CHARACTER
ASSASSINATION AT THE LAST
POSSIBLE MOMENT.
I JUST WANT TO GO BACK FOR A
SECOND ABOUT THESE OTHER
DEMOCRATS.
REMEMBER, NORTH DAKOTA HAS VOTED
16 OF THE LAST 17 ELECTIONS FOR
A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO
FAVORED A CONSERVATIVE JUDGE.
INDIANA HAS VOTED TO 15 OF LAST
17 ELECTIONS FOR A CONSERVATIVE
WHO WANTS CONSERVATIVE JUDGES.
MONTANA HAS VOTED 15 OF THE LAST
17 ELECTIONS.
IF THERE IS ANY SENSE OF
REPRESENTING THE WILL OF THOSE
STATES, THOUGH SENATORS HAVE
TO VOTE FOR THIS JUDGE BECAUSE H
BEEN AN ENORMOUS MORAL PRESSURE
TO VOTE FOR THIS JUDGE BECAUSE E
FITS WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THEIR
STATES HAVE VOTED FOR.
AND IF THERE'S ANY SENSE OF
DECENCY, DEMOCRATS FROM OTHER
STATES OUGHT TO RELIEVE THIS
WEEKEND TAKE A LITTLE WHILE AND
GO PRAY ABOUT THIS.
THEIR PARTY IS GENUINELY
UNDERMINING AND SICKENING THE
PROCESS OF UNITED STATES.
>> Laura: I THINK IF YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR DECENCY, YOU ARE
LOOKING TO WASHINGTON, D.C., NOT
THE BEST PLACE TO LOOK.
