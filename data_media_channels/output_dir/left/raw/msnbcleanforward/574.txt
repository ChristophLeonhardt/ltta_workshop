LITTLE STORIES ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE,

50
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,016
WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE, WHATNOT TO DO, WHAT TO DO.

51
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:25,753
WHATNOT TO DO, WHAT TO DO. I HAD NO IDEA HOW UNIVERSAL THE

00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:28,255
I HAD NO IDEA HOW UNIVERSAL THE THEME WAS.

53
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,289
THEME WAS. SUCCESSFUL WOMEN, GETTING THERE,

00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,731
AND THEY’VE HAD TO TROT IN A FEMALE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.

78
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:10,397
FEMALE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. >> AN ASSISTANT.

79
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,132
>> AN ASSISTANT. >> THEY’RE WORRIED ABOUT THE WAY

80
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:11,699
>> THEY’RE WORRIED ABOUT THE WAY IT LOOKS.

81
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:12,967
IT LOOKS. THEY WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT

82
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,768
THEY WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT CONTINUING TO ELECT THOSE SAME

83
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,069
CONTINUING TO ELECT THOSE SAME MEN.

84
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,570
MEN. >> YEAH.

85
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,305
>> YEAH. >> WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT SAYING

86
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:18,606
>> WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT SAYING WHY DIDN’T THE LOVING PARENTS

87
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:19,507
WHY DIDN’T THE LOVING PARENTS GET INVOLVED?

88
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:20,708
GET INVOLVED? THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DRUNK.

89
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,411
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DRUNK. THAT’S NOT -- THAT SHOWS, TO ME,

90
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:24,912
THAT’S NOT -- THAT SHOWS, TO ME, ZERO PROGRESS.

91
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:28,015
ZERO PROGRESS. >> THE PRESIDENT’S DISGUSTING

92
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,417
>> THE PRESIDENT’S DISGUSTING COMMENTS ABOUT ONE OF THE

93
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:30,285
COMMENTS ABOUT ONE OF THE ACCUSERS I THINK SPEAKS FOR

94
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:30,618
ACCUSERS I THINK SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

95
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:32,587
ITSELF. I THINK IT’S DISGUSTING.

96
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:35,423
I THINK IT’S DISGUSTING. AND I THINK MOST WOMEN TOO DO.

97
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:36,858
AND I THINK MOST WOMEN TOO DO. I DON’T KNOW WHY SOME ALLOW IT

98
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:37,925
I DON’T KNOW WHY SOME ALLOW IT IN THIS PRESIDENT.

99
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:39,193
IN THIS PRESIDENT. BUT IN TERMS OF REPUBLICAN

100
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,528
BUT IN TERMS OF REPUBLICAN LEADERS IT’S REALLY AN

101
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:42,897
LEADERS IT’S REALLY AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT BECAUSE THIS

102
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:44,832
INCREDIBLE MOMENT BECAUSE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO, I THINK,

103
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,100
IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO, I THINK, APPEAL TO THE FEMALE VOTE,

104
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:46,835
APPEAL TO THE FEMALE VOTE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE MIDTERMS

105
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:47,769
ESPECIALLY WITH THE MIDTERMS COMING UP.

106
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:49,637
COMING UP. WHY WOULDN’T YOU SAY I WANT TO

00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:50,638
WHY WOULDN’T YOU SAY I WANT TO HEAR HER STORY?

108
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,174
HEAR HER STORY? WHY WOULDN’T YOU SAY I WANT TO

109
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,642
WHY WOULDN’T YOU SAY I WANT TO RESPECT HER STORY AND UNDERSTAND

110
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:57,011
RESPECT HER STORY AND UNDERSTAND IT AND I WANT TO GET THE FACTS?

111
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:59,447
IT AND I WANT TO GET THE FACTS? WHY WOULDN’T YOU ASK FOR AN FBI

112
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:01,316
WHY WOULDN’T YOU ASK FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT IF

113
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,250
INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE?

114
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:04,652
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE? THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS

115
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:05,820
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS ACTUALLY WIN POLITICALLY BY

116
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,522
ACTUALLY WIN POLITICALLY BY HAVING THESE WOMEN BE HEARD.

117
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:09,057
HAVING THESE WOMEN BE HEARD. >> WELL, YOU KNOW WHOSE VALUE

118
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:12,994
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHOSE VALUE WAS NOT HEARD TWO NIGHTS AGO?

119
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:13,929
WAS NOT HEARD TWO NIGHTS AGO? BRETT KAVANAUGH’S WIFE WHEN SHE

120
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,463
BRETT KAVANAUGH’S WIFE WHEN SHE WAS ASKED IN THAT FOX INTERVIEW

121
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:16,331
WAS ASKED IN THAT FOX INTERVIEW SHOULD THERE BE AN INVESTIGATION

122
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:18,066
SHOULD THERE BE AN INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR YOUR FAMILY’S NAME?

123
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,934
TO CLEAR YOUR FAMILY’S NAME? AND WHAT HAPPENED?

124
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:21,369
AND WHAT HAPPENED? HER HUSBAND CUT HER OFF AND

125
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:21,970
HER HUSBAND CUT HER OFF AND ANSWERED THE QUESTION.

126
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,071
ANSWERED THE QUESTION. >> I SEE IT DIFFERENTLY.

127
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,273
>> I SEE IT DIFFERENTLY. WHAT I SAW WAS -- AND I DON’T

128
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,341
WHAT I SAW WAS -- AND I DON’T KNOW HER.

129
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,443
KNOW HER. BUT I FEEL REALLY BADLY FOR HER.

130
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:28,977
BUT I FEEL REALLY BADLY FOR HER. >> ABSOLUTELY.

131
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,245
>> ABSOLUTELY. >> NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION.

132
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:30,979
>> NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION. >> AND HIS DAUGHTERS.

133
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,746
>> AND HIS DAUGHTERS. >> AND HIS DAUGHTERS.

134
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:34,382
>> AND HIS DAUGHTERS. AND THIS IS A FAMILY THAT

135
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:35,784
AND THIS IS A FAMILY THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE BEING

136
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:38,420
POTENTIALLY COULD BE BEING SMEARED AND CONVICTED UNFAIRLY.

137
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:41,156
SMEARED AND CONVICTED UNFAIRLY. WE DON’T KNOW.

138
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:43,091
WE DON’T KNOW. SO I THINK BOTH SIDES NEED TO BE

139
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:43,959
SO I THINK BOTH SIDES NEED TO BE TREATED WITH GREAT RESPECT.

140
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,360
TREATED WITH GREAT RESPECT. BUT IN THAT MOMENT I FELT

141
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,595
BUT IN THAT MOMENT I FELT SOMETHING PERSONAL, I SAW HER

142
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:47,763
SOMETHING PERSONAL, I SAW HER JUST KIND OF LOOK AT HIM.

143
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,197
JUST KIND OF LOOK AT HIM. AND THAT LOOK MIGHT HAVE SAID

144
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,765
AND THAT LOOK MIGHT HAVE SAID HELP ME, I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO

145
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:51,066
HELP ME, I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

146
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,501
SAY. SHE DOESN’T DO THIS FOR A

147
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:52,801
SHE DOESN’T DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

148
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,136
LIVING. THIS IS NOT HER JOB.

149
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,504
THIS IS NOT HER JOB. SHE’S NOT A FEDERAL JUDGE AND I

150
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:57,005
SHE’S NOT A FEDERAL JUDGE AND I THINK THE QUESTION MIGHT HAVE

151
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,874
THINK THE QUESTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HER, MIGHT

152
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,509
BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HER, MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING SHE DOESN’T

153
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,510
HAVE BEEN SOMETHING SHE DOESN’T WANT TO ANSWER.

154
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:03,378
WANT TO ANSWER. I DON’T HAVE A JUDGMENT ON THAT.

155
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,413
I DON’T HAVE A JUDGMENT ON THAT. I DON’T THINK HE JUMPED IN TO

156
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:05,381
I DON’T THINK HE JUMPED IN TO CUT HER OFF.

157
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:06,315
CUT HER OFF. LOOK AT IT AGAIN.

158
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:07,783
LOOK AT IT AGAIN. THERE’S A LOT MORE GOING ON, I

159
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:08,984
THERE’S A LOT MORE GOING ON, I THINK, IN JUST ONE LOOK BETWEEN

160
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:09,985
THINK, IN JUST ONE LOOK BETWEEN THEM THAN POTENTIALLY WHAT

161
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:10,986
THEM THAN POTENTIALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING.

162
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:11,887
PEOPLE ARE SAYING. >> DO YOU THINK ME TOO HAS MADE

163
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:12,988
>> DO YOU THINK ME TOO HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE?

164
