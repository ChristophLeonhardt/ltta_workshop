there are seven and a half billion people on earth and they all need to be fed but producing food requires huge amounts of land water and is one of the major contributors to pollution and climate change past the planets habitable surface is cultivated for crops while forests are being cleared for industrial animal farming and commercial fishing is emptying our seas of marine life with a worldwide population predicted to grow to 10 billion by 2050 it's clear our planet can't keep up the pace something has to change I'm not so beard on the east coast of the US we're a community of scientists fishermen and foodies are redefining a relationship with the sea and I'm Guillory Dobby in Holland where scientists are racing to future-proof our planet against our love of meat for centuries we've been harvesting the oceans without much thought of sustainability today we twice as much fish as we did fifty years ago the result is that the oceans have been depleted to catastrophic ly unsustainable levels ninety percent of the fish stocks that we rely on being fully fished or over fished to make matters worse the use of agrochemicals both in the sea and on the land is creating dead zones areas of high acidity and low oxygen which are one of the biggest global threats to marine life they were already around 500 of them worldwide the biggest in the Gulf of Mexico covering 23,000 square kilometers for the seas to thrive far into the future we need to fundamentally rethink our relationship with the oceans and here on the coast of Connecticut they're doing just that fishing has always been big business on the Long Island Sound but in recent decades industrial and agricultural pollutants killed off fish stocks I've come here to meet some of the locals tackling the problem Bren Smith is an ocean farmer who's made it his mission to reconfigure how we harvest the seed okay welcome aboard the good thing about ocean farming is we don't need to chase fish all right it's a quick run out right you used to be a fisherman yeah yeah I was in the Bering Sea fishing Cod and crab just at the height of industrialized fishing and most of fish I was catching was going to McDonalds for the fish sandwich Wow that is like the quintessential the epitome of the industrial fishing exactly so then you know as on the Bering Sea in the cod stocks crashed in Newfoundland back roads from and so I went to become a farmer on the salmon farms because that was posed for the answered overfishing but it was just as bad right you know using pesticides antibiotics polluting you know I we're essentially running pig farms at sea so I ended up down here and remade myself as a you know what we're calling a 3d ocean farmer what is it what is a 3d motion farm sir I mean by that imagine an underwater garden right where you're using the entire water column which means we have very small for clear-cut vertical right the entire farm is cultivated of a system of lions and boys which act like scaffolding kelp grows from the horizontal lines closest to the surface then vertically downwards there are muscles and then below that oysters and clams on the ocean floor Brent has a 20 acre farm which produces 53 thousand kilos of kelp every year along with 200 thousand kilos of shellfish today I'm going to help check the lines all right there's the vegetable of the sea right there let's attach the mussel stock okay unlike conventional aquaculture Brens ocean farming has no need for agro chemicals in fact the even seems to clean the water of pollution and it sequester's carbon thereby helping to tackle climate change is there a reason why you've chosen mussels and so they're really lean proteins packed full of omega threes but also soak up nitrogen they filtered they use nitrogen to grow filter it out of the water column and you know this farm filters billions of gallons of water a week and oyster filters up to 50 gallons a day this is one Oh Easter Wow if you were to take a network of these farms totalling five percent of US waters you could remove the equivalent carbon output of over a million cars what the kelp does is it reduces the acidification rate it pulls so much carbon and nitrogen out then it changes the water quality so we've done studies and it's called the halo effect of the kelp actually working together with the oyster well but companion companion species exactly and Wow you know they're meant to be together romantic friends claims are certainly intriguing but can this system really helped clear up dead zones and revitalize the seeds at the seaweed marine biotechnology lab at the University of Connecticut Stanford they've been studying just this question this is proper science what's going on in here growing right here dr. Simona Olga is leading research in some coastal estuaries like Long Island Sound we have a lot of nutrient runoff so from fertilizers or from wastewater treatment plants it's a lot of those nutrients get concentrated into the water and then they can cause problems like harmful algal blooms or you know hypoxic conditions and so by growing seaweed as in addition to shellfish we can uptake some of those nutrients and help clean up the waters and the hypoxic that's like low oxygen right yes exactly which is no good like for for poor finish exactly Simona is going to show me how they use kelp to both monitor and clean the waters in the sand we're gonna do is we're gonna take some of this harvested kelp that we pulled off the long lines and we're gonna grind it up in the in this little machine once pulverized Simona can calculate that level of nitrogen in the kelp which in turn helps it learn how much needs to be grown to clean the waters of pollutants based on that then we can say you know based on that percentage if we grow this much seaweed on this long of a line then we're taking up that much nitrogen from the water information like this is vital for Brent who uses it to determine how much kelpy has to cultivate in order to improve the water in his patch of the sound 3d farming proposes a close collaboration between fishermen and scientists but that's not all yet another important partnership is happening on dry land tobe Fisher is a farmer who recently started working with Bren he used to use conventional fertilizer until six months ago when he switched to kelp so those were pressing the kelp turned into fertilizer yeah it has a nice a nice smell to it that's how you know it's the good stuff so what is actually going on here like why why do you not just put it straight on the fields the nutrients from the kelp will will transfer over to the water because you see the kelp just turns into like a goo and so all the nutrients reaches out into the liquid and then we can use the liquid to fertilize I'm not gonna get like some crab jumping you never know tobey's farm grows over 25 different kinds of fruit and veg supplying the local community and it's this organic plant based fertilizer that he now uses on all these crops it's gonna ruin kale for you though because you'll never taste Kol it tastes that good again do you feel a kind of connection to the sea because of this operation most land-based farmers don't think about their actions and how they affect the sea the nutrient runoff from the land they got into the ocean the kelp uses it to grow and then it comes back here so it really closes this sea see the land loop closing this land to sea loop is a huge part of 3d farming's appeal but in the center of New Haven there's another collaboration which is putting sustainability on the menu I'm off to meet Abby Shapiro head chef at Roya to find out more bran came to me with the kelp and he's like here it is use it once he started telling me the story once we started dialoguing on the benefit more than anything sustainability perspective I started playing around with it I started using it in a variety of different ways that I can feel like man this has legs so I just go ahead and yeah go ahead and and as you would regular pasta he smells fantastic right you goes it's good it's good we're gonna actually see this kind of ocean farming have a significant impact on ocean cleanup on climate change your new clean enough we need to eat loads of this stuff we need to be aw you gotta seduce the customer if I seduce the customer into a way that people start asking for it then let Brent figure out how to mass-produce it that's not my that's not my department yeah my goal is if they like it I've done my bit a change is afoot here in New Haven and 3d farming is that the heart of it all I mean we've got to tell a story and a hopeful story about the future try to you know it's all bad news about climate change and food security stuff like that but I think out here we can say air oceans are a blank slate and this our chance to really build something new and build some from the bottom up that is sustainable restorative and doesn't make all the mistakes of industrial agriculture and dust industrial agriculture it's estimated that each week we lose an area the size of Manhattan as a result of intensive / farming nearly one third of the planets land is severely degraded and agriculture is largely to blame if we don't act fast the UN projects the world has only 60 years of harvests left but there are glimmers of Hope seemingly barren landscapes can hide an underground forest of living tree stumps roots and seeds in Africa a technique called farmer managed natural regeneration is nurturing this hidden vegetation to bring fertility back to damaged land developed to new share and now used by farmers across the continent it uses restorative methods such as selective pruning and thinning of shrubs to stimulate rapid growth leading to taller stronger trees and healthier soils over farmed lands once prone to soil erosion desertification and drought are coming back to life so far around 70 million hectares of lands have been revived improving the food security and livelihoods of communities across Africa the African Union has stipulated that a further 100 million hectares of degraded land must be restored by 2030 F MNR is one of the techniques being used to achieve this over the past century meat consumption has risen dramatically a growing and more affluent population wants more and more of it an industrialized farming has made it a staple by 2050 global appetites are set to more than double which is environmentally unsustainable the scientists have come up with a breakthrough solution to the problem which means in the future the meat we see here won't come from the farm but from a laboratory place is hopping it's really busy in there and it's not even noon people are serious about their meat and I ask you what you're buying let this treat everybody how much meat would you say you guys go through in a week probably a whole cow full that's like a full Noah's Ark I'm here serving up every way on average Britons get through 84 kilos a week per person per year and it isn't just an eat at home treat at Corrigan's in Mayfair they cater to a mainly meat-eating clientele how important would you say heat is to the menu year it doesn't matter how how much the trends keep changing there's always gonna be somebody looking for something like this could you imagine ever a day where you're placing a need that was grown in a laboratory on that master barbecue I would find it hard to believe our unique selling point would be gone Conrad's beeps like this getting it from the farm to here to the customer is what we're all about for me what is appealing about the lab-grown option is that no animals are killed and it takes up less environmental space and there's less of an impact on the waterways in the land and I feel like that could kind of maybe offer a sort of an alternative to this demand that isn't diminishing what do you think about that I'd like you to beat it and try it and trying to sell it to to a consumer I think I can understand aidan skepticism but lab-grown meat is already a reality and it's only a matter of time before it reaches the public in 2013 dr. mark post and his team at the University of Maastricht in Holland made headline news when they proved it was possible to grow meat with a single cow muscle sample it feels like conventional hamburger and now the race is on with scientists competing to be the first to create a lab-grown burger to market to the masses I've come to the University of Maastricht in Holland where dr. post has agreed to talk me through how they make cultured meat mark and his colleagues are one of a number of teams around the world who are searching for a way to scale up production of lab-grown meat if they succeed the environmental impact could be enormous cows are ruminants they have these funny multi stomach things were they basically bacteria in their stomach ferment and in that fermentation process methane gets released that's affecting global warming and the climate and methane is actually a very powerful greenhouse gas is 20 times more powerful than co2 so yeah and and livestock is accountable for 40% of all methane emission the impact of farming cattle on climate change is so significant that some experts believe giving up beef reduces our carbon footprint more than giving up cars but how do we get a hamburger from a test-tube so this is a small piece of muscle taken from with a biopsy with a needle biopsy this is taken a half an hour ago from Macau what's the next step then once you do the extraction the the stem cells in a muscle are just sitting there waiting to repair the tissue and it's injured so the muscle fibers is torn then the Celsus stem cells come in and they start to proliferate and form a new muscle tissue that's what they do in the body so what we're doing right now is dissecting dissecting every single muscle fiber so that the stem cells kind of think well there's an injury here we need to start coming out and start to proliferate that helps them multiply everything them into thinking they need to repair a part of the body right so out of this small extraction that we've taken how many patties do you think we could grow about 80,000 80,000 burger patties just from this bit of liquid right that's unbelievable the tissue is then placed into a blender before an enzyme is added to break it down even further into individual muscle fibers so by maximizing how much you break down the tissue in encourage the cells to multiply you're getting more product out of that bit of liquid right once broken down further and fed a special culturing solution the cells are placed in an incubator so the conditions in here are replicating the conditions inside the cow right okay temperature temperature oxygen oxygen co2 every that they need you in the warmth they will begin to multiply and once there are enough cells they're taken out and grouped together where they automatically contract to form tissue this is the moment I've been waiting for actually seeing a tangible burger so this is this is the end result where you have the individual fibers so this is about 400 of those fibers the entire hamburger is about 10,000 yeah I mean that look that looks like mincemeat for me that's absolutely mint and grown purely in a lab this is grow impurity in a lab yeah and this is pure meat though mark and his colleagues have proved that the science works the challenge for his team and others all around the world is producing cultured meat in a cost-effective way I'm hoping pewter verse trade marks business partner can offer some thoughts on who might be the first to get this product to supermarket shelves hi Guillory welcome come in Thanks the initial breakthroughs really happened in the labs here but the idea is really taken off in the US and Silicon Valley where all the tech startups are and there seems to be a space race to get this product on the shelves what's going on over there and how does that compete with what's happening here well to be honest we don't exactly know what's going on there we know that a lot of money investment money's going to words several companies and they all sort of have the same tentative timing with respect to them going to the market as we have being that in a couple of years the first initial small introduction in the markets over eight products will happen and I was going to be the first we love to see there's no question the future of meat will be different for all of us but if I'm honest I'm not sure what I think about eating meat laughs and I suspect that I'm not alone hi I'm Guillory hi pleased to meet you Cort Vaughn men's board an absurd and based artist is determined to get us to confront our discomfort starting with the future forward cookbook not in every kitchen yet is it not yet it's 45 recipes you cannot cook yet so all these dishes they are specifically made to stir the conversation I hope it will familiarize more people with this new technology so that it's less scary and it will facilitate the conversation around it so that we can make better choices on which what we actually want did I see a classic kebab in there as an Iranian that's the one I'm yeah well this is indeed the in vitro kebab it has its own bio incubator so basically this kebab will be growing infinitely it's interesting when I think of the kebab and and my culture I mean the slaughter of the animal and the preparation of the food the whole ritual is such a big part of different cultures I think it might be really hard to sort of separate that's you absolutely yes and we can only do it if we replace it with new kinds of rituals or behaviors that's have new meaning as well court expects that within the next 10 years we will all be confronted by lab-grown meat on our plates in readiness of that he's taking reservations at an unusual restaurant is this an actual restaurant that you go to or is it an online one or how does it work it's called in vitro bistro right now it's only an online restaurant and we serve food for thought because we only take reservations from 2028 what you do is pick a starter main course and a dessert this one is for more Korean people well because in Korea there's this habit of eating live octopus oh and this is something similar over them completely synthetic and it it moves but it this doesn't have some system it does not feel pain and there it goes not for you I know yeah from April yet we have room April 2029 maybe look something for my birthday ok I think your booking is be made across the world's large-scale food production increases demands on Natural Resources and leads to habitat loss but there are ways to reduce these effects in Costa Rica tree planting to create living fences is reversing the deforestation once caused by cattle ranching absorbing co2 and fixing the soil around the ranch whilst in Qatar the mixing of a naturally occurring fungus with the local soil has enabled plants to absorb water more efficiently reducing the pressure on scarce water supplies and in Cameroon instead of large monoculture cocoa plantations farmers are planting a mixture of fruit trees leaving natural forests intact increasing diversity and providing regular income changes like these however low tech are vital if we are to feed our growing population in ways that also safeguards the planets you
