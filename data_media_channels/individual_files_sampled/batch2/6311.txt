just reporting live here because the latest numbers are in 52 killed 1700 wounded by the massacre of Palestinians at the Gaza border at the hands of Israeli government led by the right-wing administration of Benjamin Netanyahu I know why he's doing it I know that it's to distract from his own corruption which he's in trouble for in Israel and I know he doesn't want a peace deal and he thinks more hostilities more violence is more likely to lead to war which supports the right-wing government I understand all that behind the politics of it and and if you can't understand why it is terrible for the Palestinians or for Humanity to have those people mowed down at the border and killed and and 1,700 wounded there's something deeply wrong with you but I get it people are blinded and they've got and they've got those blinders on they say no I'm always right the other side is Devils and I'm angels and if I killed 52 of them and I shot 1700 of them they made me do it they made me die they're so powerful with their stones and burning tires whew that I had to kill them all I had to shoot them all with live bullets I know that that's what a lot of right-wingers in Israel think now and Israel feels besieged and there is this great irony that they feel like they're victims like oh my god we're surrounded by enemies and we have no power and at the same time they feel invincible what difference does it make we'll occupy the Palestinians for 60 years a hundred and 60 years and there's not a goddamn thing they could do about it because all they had was a stupid slingshot and a bunch of rocks and we have nukes and we can just shoot a ball we can just shoot them all we're invincible plus we're victims I understand that line of thinking and so for those people who are already so set in their ways and so mired in the muck of this disaster and this conflict this endless conflict that they can't see straight I'm never going to be able to reach them on those grounds because as as a commentator said on a fox show over the weekend he said Palestinians aren't people anyway so they'll let me try to reach out to you this way whether you think it's right or not right this is terrible for Israel do you not understand that the whole world looks at this and does not see it the way that you do if you're a right-winger in Israel they see it as Israel is occupying these people it has been for decades and has no plan not to occupy them now they're leaning away from a two-state solution and then they mode these people down that's how the rest of the world sees it and rightfully so and if you say I don't care about the rest of the world they're all anti-semitic okay fine man I know you can't do anything wrong so if anyone ever criticizes you for killing other people oh they're just anti-semitic look you couldn't you can go and feel good about yourself thinking that about that way and by the way are there real anti-semites that don't like Israel because of that of course yes there are yes there are okay but that doesn't mean that every action that Israel takes is the right one and if you actually support Israel and you actually love Israel you want it to survive and you wanted to flourish and you don't want it to be the bad guys in the world you have got to end the occupation and you've got to end the massacres of Palestinians over and over again because whether you like it or not whether you agree or not the great majority of the world now sees Israel as the bad guys as the occupiers as Goliath the one that are doing the injustice and the oppression and you can say they shouldn't the Palestinians made us kill them I don't agree with that but even if you think that it's not changing the fact that the whole you're setting the whole world against you it is terrible for Israel even if you don't care about the Palestinians and you don't care about anything else it's terrible for Israel for that perception and be out there so for God's sake turn around turn around and the occupation let them control their own border and then if they attacked it and the world will be on your side I know you don't believe that because you think oh no no they'll hate us no matter what how about doing the right thing and seeing if that's true or not true we haven't tried that in forever so look up - I'll give you all the details on tonight's show you know we're live at 6 o'clock Eastern and and then Bernie Sanders having a town-hall tonight on the issue of Iran which is deeply related to this issue that's a 7 o'clock tonight all that's on t y-t-dot-com slash live but right now as I'm reading those stories of people being mowed down and and killed one after another after another to try to desperately end the occupation I know they it's they also care about Jerusalem me I don't care about Jerusalem at all I'm I'm an atheist I think it's a God forsaken City I'll talk more about that on tonight's show ok but they do care about it and and both sides care about it at least the violence so whether it's the United States of America moving our embassy whether it's Israel killing the people at the border we have got to find a better way otherwise both Israel and the United States will be hated by the rest of the world I don't want that I want the violence to end I want a two-state solution there's got to be a way to do this with justice and I'm by the way the instrument Jerusalem here I'll solve it for you real quick Israelis good half Palestinians get half they both get to call it their eternal capital it's not that hard the only reason we're not doing it is because the right wing doesn't want us to do it because they profit from war and they hate peace that's the reality of the situation get rid of the goddamn right wing in both America and Israel and you'll be shocked at how quickly we can get peace and justice
