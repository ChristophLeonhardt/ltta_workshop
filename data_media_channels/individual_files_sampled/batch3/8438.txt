EMBASSY. THAT IS A BIG DIPLOMATIC SHIFT. BRET? Bret: BENJAMIN HALL IN JERUSALEM. BENJAMIN, THANK YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS RAISING EYE BRAS TONIGHT WITH A MOVE TO REVERSE COURSE ON A TOUGH SET OF PENALTIES AGAINST A MAJOR CHINESE BUSINESS. SOME SEE IT AS A STEP TO EASE TRADE TENSIONS. OTHERS REGARD THE MOVE AS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY. LATE THIS AFTERNOON, WE RECEIVED NEWS OF A DIFFERENT SORT CONCERNING THE HEALTH OF THE FIRST LADY. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS LEADS US OFF TONIGHT WITH THAT. GOOD EVENING, JOHN. BRET, GOOD EVENING. FIRST THING WE CAN TELL YOU IS THE FIRST LADY IS OKAY. SHE WONDER WENT A CATHETERIZATION EARLIER TODAY TO TREAT A NONLIFE THREATENING CONDITION IN ONE OF HER KIDNEYS. THE WHITE HOUSE KEPT IT VERY, HUSH HUSH UNTIL SHE WAS OUT OF THE OR. IN A STATEMENT THE FIRST LADY'S OFFICE SAID MELANIA TRUMP UNDER WENT ELM BOWLISM TO TREAT A BEE NINE KIDNEY CONDITION. THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS. MRS. TRUMP IS AT WALTER REED NATIONAL MILITARY MEDICAL CENTER AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN THERE FOR THE DURATION OF THE WEEK. THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD NOT SAY WHAT THE CONDITION IS, BUT ELM BOWLIZATION IS TYPICALLY USED TO TREAT TUMORS IN THE KIDNEY. A THIN CATHETER CUTS OFF BLOOD FLOW TO THE TUMOR TUMOR. IF IS IT IS BENIGN THE TUMOR SHRINKS AND DISAPPEARS. THE PRESIDENT DID NOT THE PRESIDENT DID TOT THE PRESIDENT DID TRAVEL WITH THE FIRST LADY. LATER THIS MORNING HE TRAVELED UP TO VISIT HER. PRESIDENT TRUMP HEADED TO IOWA SENSITIVE TRADE ISSUE WITH IOWA. U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST U.S. TELECOM GIANT ZT. . THE PRESIDENT TWEETING THIS AFTERNOON ZTE THE LARGE CHINESE PHONE COMPANY BRINGS A BIG PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUAL PARTS FROM U.S. COMPANIES. ALSO REFLECTIVE OF THE LARGER TRADE DEAL WE ARE NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA AND MY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT XI. IT WAS A RATHER STUNNING TURN FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS RAILED AGAINST CHINA STEALING AMERICAN JOBS. ZTE HAD BEEN PUNISHED FOR VIOLATING U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN AND NORTH KOREA. THE HEADS OF SIX MAJOR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WORRY THAT ZTE DEVICES COULD BE USED TO SPY ON AMERICANS. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU WOULD RECOMMEND THAT AMERICAN CITIZENS USE ZTE SERVICES. NONE OF YOU AGAIN ARE RAISING YOUR HAND. THANK YOU FOR THAT. CHINESE OFFICIALS COMING TO D.C. LATER THIS WEEK FOR TRADE TALKS AND PRESIDENT JINPING'S HELP WITH NORTH KOREA STALE CRUCIAL PART OF THE DIPLOMATIC CALCULATION PRESIDENT TRUMP FELT IT NECESSARY TO DIAL BACK ON ZTE. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS PART OF A VERY COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA THAT INVOLVES ECONOMIC ISSUES, NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES AND THE LIKE. IT'S AN ISSUE OF HIGH CONCERN FOR CHINA THAT'S BEEN RAISE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND WITH OUR ADMINISTRATION AT VARIOUS LEVELS. MOVE BROUGHT A SHARP RESPONSE FROM THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER. WHAT HAPPENED TO AMERICA FIRST? PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LATEST ABOUT FACE ON TRADE POLICY WON'T MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. IT WILL MAKE CHINA GREAT AGAIN. THE BACK PEDDLE ON ZTE KEEPS A WAY CLEAR FOR CHINA'S CONTINUED ASSISTANCE ON NORTH KOREA. CHINA ALSO PLEASED THAT THE U.S. APPEARS POISED TO OFFER NORTH KOREA SECURITY ASSURANCES IF IT DISMANTLES NUCLEAR PROGRAM. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SECURITY ASSURANCES TO BE SURE. THIS HAS BEEN THE TRADEOFF THAT'S BEEN PENDING FOR 25 YEARS. NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER PUT AMERICA IN A POSITION WHERE THE NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS TRULY POSSIBLE THAT THE AMERICANS WOULD ACTUALLY DO THIS. WOULD LEAD TO THE PLACE WHERE AMERICA WAS NO LONGER HELD AT RISK BY THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME. THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE. MEANWHILE SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS LATE THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE PRESIDENT REALLY WANTED TO BE THERE WHEN THE FIRST LADY TRAVELED UP TO WALTER REED MILITARY MEDICAL CENTER FOR HER PROCEDURE THIS MORNING BUT IF HE HAD ACCOMPANIED HER, HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO BRING THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS POOL WITH HIM. THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO KEEP TONIGHT DOWN LOW SO THAT'S, BRET,
