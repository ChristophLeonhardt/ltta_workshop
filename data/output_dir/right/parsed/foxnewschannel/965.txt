>> Laura: A STUNNING REPORT
FROM CATHERINE HERRIDGE.
ROD ROSENSTEIN THREATENED TO
SUBPOENA EMAILS AND PHONE
RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS OF
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE UNTIL
COMMITTEE.
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS
CAME TO ROSENSTEIN'S DEFENSE
EARLIER TONIGHT.
>> I'M CONFIDENT DEPUTY
ROSENSTEIN, 28 YEARS AND THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, DID NOT
IMPROPERLY THREATEN ANYONE ON
THE OCCASION.
WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TRIED TO
BE COOPERATIVE WITH THEM AND
MADE PROGRESS AS THE MONTHS OF
GONE BY.
IN FACT, HAVE HAD SOME GOOD
RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS.
>> Laura: WITH A WAR BETWEEN
THE DEAR JAN CONGRESS HEATING
UP, TWO LAWMAKERS TRIES TO MAKE
A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT EXCLUSIVELY
ON "THE ANGLE."
MARK MEADOWS AND JIM JORDAN.
>> WHAT IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
SAYING?
ROD ROSENSTEIN HASN'T COMPLIED
WITH DEVIN NUNES SUBPOENA OR BOB
GOODLATTE SUBPOENA.
REDACTING THE FACT THAT PETER
STRZOK WAS FRIENDS WITH JUDGE
CONTRERAS.
TODAY WE LEARNED THAT THE HEAD
OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, ROD
ROSENSTEIN, WAS THREATENING
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE FOR DOING
THEIR JOB FOR TRYING TO GET
ANSWERS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS THAT'S
OKAY?
WE ARE DOING JUST FINE?
I DIDN'T KNOW HE SAID THAT.
I'M LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THE REPORT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
ROD ROSENSTEIN SAY HE'S GOING TO
GO AFTER STAFF MEMBERS, EMAILS
AND COMMUNICATIONS.
>> Laura: HE WANTS YOUR
BLACKBERRY.
>> WE ARE DOING OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY.
>> Laura: CONGRESSMAN MEADOWS,
WHAT I THINK HE'S SAYING IS THAT
IF YOU GUYS HOLD HIM IN
CONTEMPT, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO
DEFEND HIMSELF.
PART OF THE DEFENSE WILL BE HE
WANTS DISCOVERY.
HE WANTS TO KNOW WHO YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING TO, WHO YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING TO, WANTS TO KNOW YOUR
TEXT MESSAGES.
MAYBE THEY WON'T REDACT YOUR
DOCUMENTS LIKE THEY DID THE PAGE
AND STRZOK TEXTS.
>> THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO
DO THAT UNLESS WE ARE COMING
UNDER A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.
FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SAY
HE IS CONFIDENT ROD ROSENSTEIN I
DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.
I'M CONFIDENT HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE ARE FED
UP WITH IT.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A
RESOLUTION.
WE HAVE A RESOLUTION SMITE THAT
WE'RE PUTTING THE FINISHING
TOUCHES ON.
WE PLAN TO FILE IT TOMORROW BUT
THE REALLY --
>> Laura: WHAT IS IT?
>> IT'S ABOUT COMPELLING DOJ TO
TURN OVER DOCUMENTS SO THAT WE
CAN DO PROPER OVERSIGHT.
IF THEY HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE,
TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS.
JIM IS RIGHT.
IT'S INEXCUSABLE.
>> Laura: WHAT HAPPENS?
RESOLUTION TO COMPEL THE
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS?
>> WE HAVE SUBPOENAED THEM
ALREADY.
PUTTING TOGETHER A RESOLUTION
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO
THE FULL HOUSE AND HAVE THEM
VOTE.
IT'S ONE THING FOR US TO SAY.
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO SAY IF THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WOULD
GO ON RECORD AS A
MR. ROSENSTEIN, THE MAJORITY OF
THE HOUSES YOU'RE NOT GIVING US
THE INFORMATION WE NEED.
FRANKLY, NOW THAT WE HAVE FOUND
OUT YOU WERE THREATENING MEMBERS
OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF, A
STANDING COMMITTEE.
>> Laura: HE'S GOING TO DEFEND
HIMSELF AGAINST YOU ARE
THREATENING TO CALL HIM IN
CONTEMPT.
HOW DOES HE DEFEND HIMSELF?
>> LET'S COME ON TOMORROW NIGHT.
LET'S LET ROD ROSENSTEIN COME ON
WITH JIM AND I.
>> Laura: I HAVE INVITED THEM
ON THE SHOW MANY TIMES.
>> THEY WOULD RATHER DO PRIVATE
PRESS RELEASES TO SPIN THE
NARRATIVE AT MIDNIGHT AND TRY TO
ACT LIKE THEY ARE COMPLYING.
WE'VE HAD A DOCUMENT OUT SINCE
NOVEMBER 3RD OF LAST YEAR ASKING
FOR DOCUMENTS.
WE HAVE LESS THAN 60% OF THOSE
DOCUMENTS.
>> Laura: THIS DRAFT YOU HAVE,
IS IT GOING TO CALL FOR HIS
REMOVAL?
>> IT CALLS FOR THEM TO RELEASE
THE DOCUMENTS.
>> THE HOUSE IS SPOKEN AND SAY
WE WANT THIS INFORMATION.
>> Laura: THEN WHAT?
>> EVERYTHING IS STILL ON THE
TABLE.
CONTEMPT AND THOSE REMEDIES ARE
STILL ON THE TABLE.
LET'S HAVE THE HOUSE TAKE A VOTE
AND SEND A MESSAGE THAT THE
MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE AGREES.
WE ARE ENTITLED TO GET ANSWERS.
>> Laura: ARE WE TALKING
IMPEACHMENT?
>> THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE IN
OUR TOOLBOX.
WE WILL HAVE A VOTE.
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU AND YOUR
VIEWERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A VOTE
ON THE HOUSE FLOOR ONE WAY OR
ANOTHER.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A VOTE AND
WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
GET THOSE DOCUMENTS.
>> Laura: ROD ROSENSTEIN
CALLED THIS EXTORTION.
HE WILL NOT GIVING TO THESE
DEMANDS.
>> HOW ABOUT WHEN YOUR
THREATENING MEMBERS OF A
STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES.
I KNOW WHO THESE GUYS ARE.
THESE ARE GUYS WHO HELPED PUT
TOGETHER THE MEMO WHICH TALKED
ABOUT WHAT WENT ON AT THE FISA
COURT AND THE FACT THEY DIDN'T
TELL THE FISA COURT WHO PAID FOR
THE DOSSIER OR THAT CHRISTOPHER
STEELE HAD BEEN FIRED BY THE FBI
FOR LEAKING INFORMATION.
THEY ARE BEING THREATENED.
IT'S AS WRONG AS IT GETS.
>> Laura: WHAT'S YOUR GENERAL
THOUGHT OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY
OF THIS INVESTIGATION.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS
GENERALLY BEFORE.
THERE'S A LOT OF SCHOLARS
BELIEVE IN DERSHOWITZ'S AND A
BUNCH OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS, THAT THIS
ENTIRE SPECIAL CONSOLE SEEMS
LIKE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL
UNDERTAKING.
THERE IS NO REAL OVERSIGHT.
THEY ESSENTIALLY HAVE A
LIMITLESS BUDGET, SEEMS LIKE
THEY DO.
>> THEY DO.
>> THE PRESIDENT SUPPOSEDLY
CAN'T REMOVE HIM.
IS THERE ANY EXECUTIVE BRANCH
OVERSIGHT IF ROD ROSENSTEIN IS
CONFLICTED?
>> HE SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF.
BASED ON THE FACTS WE'VE SEEN,
YOU SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF.
BUT THAT ASIDE, IN THIS COUNTRY,
YOU INVESTIGATE CRIMES.
YOU DON'T GO IN AND START TO
INVESTIGATE AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN
FIND AND HELP TO COME UP WITH A
CRIME AFTER YOU'VE INVESTIGATED.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE SPECIAL
CONSOLE DOING IT AND I THINK
IT'S WRONG.
>> Laura: DIDN'T HE SAY HE
WOULD MAKE THE DOCUMENTS
AVAILABLE TO THE SO-CALLED GANG
OF EIGHT?
>> THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
TOMORROW.
WE WILL SEE.
>> THEIR PRESS RELEASE THAT THEY
WERE GOING TO DO TODAY.
>> Laura: TODAY, TUESDAY.
>> NOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
THURSDAY.
>> Laura: WHAT ARE GOWDY AND
RYAN SAYING?
>> WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM.
THE FACTS ARE ON OUR SIDE.
HOW LONG IS LONG ENOUGH?
I AM SAYING TODAY IS LONG
ENOUGH.
