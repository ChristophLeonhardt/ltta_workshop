1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,801
PATTERSON JOINS US NOW.  

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,736
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS AND 

3
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:05,371
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE 

4
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,739
PERSON BEING CHARGED? 

5
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:08,942
>>   IT IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.  

6
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:09,943
IT CONFIRMS MANY THINGS WE 

7
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,144
SUSPECTED FROM PREVIOUS 

8
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:11,577
INVESTIGATIONS.  

9
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:12,512
IT ALSO CONFIRMS THINGS THAT WE 

10
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,512
SAW A HINT OF IN PREVIOUS 

11
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:14,147
INDICTMENTS.  

12
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,080
THIS IS A DIRECT CONNECTION OF 

13
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:23,156
THE DOTS BETWEEN THE MONEY  --  

14
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:23,823
THE FUNDERS, AND THE 

15
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:24,457
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HELPED -- 

16
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,091
THE HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT 

17
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:29,195
HELPED EXECUTE THE 2016 

18
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:29,528
MEDDLING.  

19
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:30,530
IT ALSO CONFIRMS MANY OF THE 

20
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,934
THINGS WE SUSPECTED ABOUT THE 

21
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,369
2018 CAMPAIGN.  

22
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,036
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER, SOCIAL 

23
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:37,871
MEDIA COMPANIES AND TECH FIRMS 

24
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,705
FOUND EVIDENCE OF WHAT THEY 

25
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,742
CALLED MEDDLING OR TAMPERING ON 

26
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,243
THEIR SERVERS.  

27
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:43,810
THIS INCLUDES MICROSOFT, 

28
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,149
FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AND TWITTER. 

29
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,317
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF 

30
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,585
INDICATION OF WHO WAS BEHIND 

31
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,919
THIS MEDDLING OR TAMPERING.  

32
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:54,487
NOW WE KNOW. 

33
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,955
>>   WHEN YOU BREAK DOWN THE 

34
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:56,622
TECH PERSPECTIVE, WHAT EXACTLY 

35
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:59,993
DID THEY DO AND HOW DID THEY 

36
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:00,326
ACHIEVE THIS? 

37
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,729
>>   THEY USED WHAT WE CALLED 

38
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:04,230
PROXY SERVERS.  

39
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,397
THESE ARE COMMONLY USED IN THE 

40
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,599
WEST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE 

41
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,701
SECURE AND SAFE WHEN YOU 

42
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,369
NAVIGATE THE WEB.  

43
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,503
IT IS KIND OF LIKE AN ENCRYPTED 

44
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:15,341
TUNNEL BETWEEN YOUR COMPUTER 

45
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,377
AND THE EXTERNAL INTERNET.  

46
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,078
SO THEY USE PROXY CENTERS TO 

47
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,181
CONCEAL THEIR IDENTITY AND SET 

48
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,049
UP DOMAIN NAMES, HOST WEBSITES. 

49
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:27,387
OFTEN WHEN WE HEARD THE TERM, 

50
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,289
FAKE NEWS IN 2016 AND 2017, 

51
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:29,756
THAT REQUIRES WEB 

52
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,156
INFRASTRUCTURE.  

53
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:30,757
THIS WEB INFRASTRUCTURE WAS 

54
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,894
BUILT ON SERVERS AND FUNDED 

55
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:35,694
THROUGH RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS. 

56
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:37,597
>>   DO WE KNOW WHAT SOCIAL 

57
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,566
MEDIA PLATFORMS THEY USED AND 

58
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,567
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY SPENT ON 

59
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,734
THIS TYPE OF A CAMPAIGN? 

60
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,869
>>   WE KNOW IT COST ABOUT $35 

61
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,503
MILLION ACCORDING TO THE 

62
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,771
INDICTMENT. 

63
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,371
$10 MILLION WAS SPECIFICALLY 

64
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:52,312
FOR THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.  

65
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,379
THIS WEB INFRASTRUCTURE WAS 

66
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,681
AGAIN WITH THE LARGE TECH 

67
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,714
FIRMS.  

68
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:57,584
IN FACT, YOU CAN BUY A SERVER 

69
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,752
ON ANY NUMBER OF PLATFORMS BUT 

70
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,989
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO REACH A 

71
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:03,923
LARGE AUDIENCE, YOU NEED CLOUD 

72
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:04,390
INFRASTRUCTURE.  

73
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,425
SO WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT TYPES 

74
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,092
OF COMPANIES THAT BUSINESSES 

75
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:10,128
USE EVERY DAY TO SET UP 

76
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:11,931
WEBSITES  --  WEBSITES.  

77
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,167
I DON'T WANT TO SAY 

78
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,368
SPECIFICALLY FACEBOOK, TWITTER, 

79
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,237
GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT BECAUSE 

80
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,272
THEY WERE NOT NAMED IN THE 

81
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,307
INDICTMENT, BUT THIS IS 

82
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,342
DEFINITELY WHERE SOME OF THE 

83
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,242
PROPAGANDA OR INFLUENCE 

84
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:23,876
CAMPAIGN CONTENT WAS.  

85
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:24,711
THE WEBSITES LIKELY LIVED ON 

86
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,378
CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDED 

87
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,979
BY SOME OF THESE COMPANIES. 

88
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:27,947
>>   WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN 

89
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:32,151
INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS, 

90
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,419
WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THEY WERE 

91
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,554
TRYING TO TACKLE? 

92
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,321
>>   THINK ABOUT A HOT BUTTON 

93
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:39,993
ISSUE IN THE UNITED STATES OVER 

94
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,295
THE LAST 18-36 MONTHS.  

95
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:42,961
THIS INCLUDES THE WOMEN'S

IT INCLUDES COLIN KAEPERNICK 

98
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,664
AND THE NFL.  

99
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,298
IT INCLUDES CHARLOTTESVILLE.  

100
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,269
IN INCLUDES ALMOST EVERY MAJOR 

101
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:49,902
ISSUE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 

102
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:50,403
DIVIDED ON.  

103
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:55,341
IT IS NOT A CONSPIRACY.  

104
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,075
IT ISRAEL.  

105
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,577
NOW WE HAVE THE INDIVIDUALS 

106
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,410
NAMED IN THESE CAMPAIGNS.  

107
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,148
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHO IS 

108
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:02,782
RESPONSIBLE FOR PUSHING CONTENT 

109
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:03,516
THAT DIVIDES AMERICANS, NOW WE 

110
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,084
KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 

111
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:05,284
THIS. 

112
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:06,018
>>   DAN PATTERSON, THANK YOU 

113
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:09,154
FOR JOINING US. 

114
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:09,922
>>>   DEADLY VIOLENCE IN
