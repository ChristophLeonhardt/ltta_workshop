WHEN YOU SAY THAT.
BRIT HUME, THANK YOU, ANOTHER
TRULY GOOD MAN.
THANKS.
MAYBE NO ONE IN HIS PROFESSIONAL
LIFE KNEW HIM AT WORK YOU CAN
MORE CLOSELY THAN BRET BAIER
DATE, OF COURSE,
"SPECIAL REPORT," HE JOINS US
TONIGHT.
BRET, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
I KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU WERE TO
CHARLES, SO I HESITATE ALMOST TO
ASK YOU ABOUT IT, BUT YOU ARE
THE PERSON TO TALK TO.
SOME HIM UP TO THE EXTENT YOU
CAN.
>> YEAH, TUCKER, THANKS FOR
HAVING ME.
I'M SORRY I'M OUT OF POCKET
TODAY OF ALL DAYS.
IT'S TREMENDOUSLY SAD.
BRIT WAS REALLY ELOQUENT IN
DESCRIBING CHARLES.
HE WAS SO WISE, SO BRILLIANT,
BUT ALSO SO CARING AND FUNNY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW THAT
PART OF HIM.
HE WAS REALLY HYSTERICAL AND
COULD GET PEOPLE LAUGHING.
AT THE COMMERCIAL BREAKS ON
"SPECIAL REPORT" ON THE PANEL,
HE OWNED THE ROOM.
HE WAS ALSO REALLY CARING.
HE WAS THE PERSON WHO REACHED
OUT FIRST, OR ONE OF THE FIRST,
EVERY TIME MY SON HAD SOME OPEN
HEART SURGERY OR SOME ISSUE IN
THE HOSPITAL.
HE WANTED TO KNOW SPECIFICS, HE
WANTS TO KNOW WHAT THE DOCTOR
SAID.
HE WANTED TO KNOW.
AND HE WAS LIKE THAT.
NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THE WORDS
AND WISDOM THAT WILL BE HIS
LEGACY ON EVERY ISSUE UNDER THE
SUN.
>> Tucker: THOSE THAT KNEW
HIM, ME INCLUDED, WERE SO
TRAINED NOT TO -- HE WANTED TO
DEEMPHASIZE HIS OWN INJURY AND
WANTED TO SHIFT THE ATTENTION
AWAY, NOT JUST FROM THAT, BUT
FROM HIMSELF.
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER MET
ANYONE LIKE THAT.
HE SEEMED TO WANT TO BE JUDGED
ON TELEVISION, CORRECT ME IF I'M
WRONG, ON THE STRENGTH --
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO CONVINCE
THEM TO DO THAT SPECIAL WHERE WE
SAT FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND
TALKED ABOUT HIS LIFE.
HE, AT FIRST, WAS VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT.
WHEN HIS BOOK CAME OUT A FEW
YEARS BACK, "THINGS THAT
MATTER," WHICH I RECOMMEND TO
PEOPLE, IT IS AMAZING TO SEE THE
RATINGS IN HIS WAY, WE HAVE A
SPECIAL TOMORROW NIGHT AT
9:00 P.M. THAT ARE HIS WORDS AS
WELL AS THE WORDS OF PEOPLE WHO
REMEMBER HIM, AND I THINK PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO ENJOY LOOKING BACK
AT THAT.
>> Tucker: IN A MOMENT WHERE
EVERYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
THEMSELVES NONSTOP AND THE
CHALLENGES THEY HAVE OVERCOME
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, CHARLES
WAS THE OPPOSITE.
HE DID NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT
HIMSELF.
I DON'T KNOW IF I KNOW ANYONE
ELSE LIKE THAT.
>> WHAT A WONDERFUL QUALITY.
HE SAID THERE WERE SO MANY
ISSUES THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT,
AND HE DID IT SO WELL.
TUCKER, HE COULD GET TO THE
POINT BETTER THAN ANYBODY.
HE COULD CUT THROUGH THE NOISE.
AND NO MATTER IF YOU AGREED WITH
HIM ARE DISAGREED WITH HIM, HE
WAS SOMEBODY THAT HE COULD JUST
GET TO THE POINT, AND PEOPLE
REALLY APPRECIATED THAT.
THE PANEL DYNAMIC, AS YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIMES
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIME,
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIMEW
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIMES
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIMEO
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIMEG
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIMEN
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIMEC
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL MANY TIME.
IT WAS A DISCUSSION, IT WASN'T
PLANNED OUT.
THAT WAS CHARLES.
HE WAS AN OP-ED, ESSENTIALLY,
EVERY TIME HE SAT THERE.
>> Tucker: YEAH.
HE WAS THE AXLE AROUND WHICH IT
REVOLVE.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SPEND MORE
TIME ON THE SET WITH HIM THEN
