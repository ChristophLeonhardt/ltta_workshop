CALLS OLIVER NORTH A, QUOTE,
WALKING LIGHTNING ROD.
SHANNON.
>> Shannon: ALL RIGHT.
TRACE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT-ELECT
OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE
ASSOCIATION JOINS US NOW LIVE TO
WEIGH IN.
YOU'RE A WALKING LIGHTNING ROD,
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY ACCURATE.
>> PROBABLY TRUE.
>> THEY'RE DEFINITELY A LOT OF
CONTROVERSY THAT YOU'RE WALKED
INTO, BUT YOU'RE NO STRANGER TO
CONTROVERSY.
>>  NO NOT AT ALL.
>> I WANT TO START BY ASKING YOU
ABOUT THIS QUOTE THAT WAS IN THE
WASHINGTON TIMES.
IN TALKING ABOUT THE PARKLAND
SURVIVORS, THE YOUNG PEOPLE NOW
CAMPAIGNING AGAINST SECOND
AMENDMENT AND GUN OWNERSHIP,
WHAT THEY DID VERY SUCCESSFULLY
WITH A FRONTAL ASSAULT AND NOW
INTIMIDATION AND SEXUAL
HARASSMENT?
LAW BREAKING HAS DISCUSSED TO
PEOPLE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
BEFORE WE MOVE TO KNOW SOME MORE
IMPORTANT STUFF.
FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE NEVER
DISPARAGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE
STUDENTS OR THE FACULTY AT THAT
SCHOOL.
EVERYTHING I SAID OR WROTE, MOST
OF IT ON THIS NETWORK AND FOR
FOX NEWS.COM WAS PALPABLE BRING
IN AFFAIR OF THE HEROISM
DISPLAYED BY SO MANY OF THEM
HAVE I SINGLE OUT ONE OF THE
YOUNGSTERS WAS KILLED TRYING TO
SAVE HIS CLASSMATES AND
SCHOOLMATES.
SO IT'S AN UNFAIR
CHARACTERIZATION.
WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO
SPECIFICALLY IN THAT ARTICLE
WASN'T THE STUDENTS.
THE STUDENTS I BELIEVE ARE BEING
USED, PERHAPS IN WAYS THAT MANY
OF THEM DON'T UNDERSTAND.
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN LAUNCHED
AGAINST NRA, WE JUST SAW IN
TRACE'S REPORT, THE LAWSUITS.
THERE IS A LEGAL -- THERE IS A
CYBER ATTACK.
THERE IS A DIRECT HARASSMENT.
THERE'S THREATS, THERE'S ALL
KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAVE NEVER
BEEN ADDRESSED TO A CIVIL RIGHTS
ORGANIZATION.
CERTAINLY NOT SINCE THE 1950s,
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS B
BDS MOVEMENT THAT'S UNDER WAY.
BOYCOTT, DIVEST AND ESSENTIALLY.
AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL
MOVEMENT VERY WELL ORCHESTRATED.
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS KINDS OF
THINGS LIKE IN THE MILITARY.
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE, AIMED AT
THE MEMBERS OF BOARD, THE
MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION AS A
WHOLE, AND IT'S THE PROP BEGAN
DA THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE
ICEBERG.
THE REST IS TRUE.
YOU CAN'T CALL IN THE FALSE
POLICE REPORT WITHOUT BREAKING
THE LAW.
THEY'VE DONE IT.
YOU CAN'T GO AFTER PEOPLE'S
PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS BY
HACKING INTO THEM IT'S AGAINST
THE LAW.
YOU CAN'T CALL PEOPLE UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF NIGHT AND THREATEN
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW, AND
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY WITH THAT.
>> YOU'RE NOT SAYING THE KIDS.
>> NO, THIS IS -- THIS THING WAS
ORGANIZED VERY WELL IN ADVANCE.
PARKLAND WAS SIMPLY THE NEXT
EVENT THAT HAPPENED IT COULD
HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE.
COULD HAVE BEEN THE EVENT THAT
HAPPENED IN THE SCHOOL IN
CALIFORNIA TODAY.
WHAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR WAS
ONE OF THESE EVENTS, AND WHOEVER
IS ORCHESTRATING IT HAS DONE AN
EFFECTIVE JOB.
IT HASN'T THIS INTENDED
CONSEQUENCES, HOWEVER.
THE NRA TODAY HAS NEARLY
6 MILLION MEMBERS.
WE'VE BEEN AROUND SINCE 1780 --
EXCUSE ME 1871.
IT'S LATE.
1871.
OLDEST CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION
IN AMERICA.
IT'S HERE TO TEACH MARKSMANSHIP.
SAFE HANDLING OF WEAPONS.
WE GO ON RANGES AND TRAINING FOR
LAW ENFORCEMENT, FOR MILITARY
GUYS.
IT'S BEEN DONE FOR LITERALLY
SINCE 1871.
>> SO I KNOW THAT THE ESTIMATES
ARE THERE ARE MORE THAN
100 MILLION AMERICAS WHO OWN
GUNS.
SO ONLY 6 MILLION IN THE NRA,
YOUR JOB IS NOW TO TRY TO BOOST
MEMBERSHIPS MIPS.
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE
CHOSEN NOT TO PARTAKE?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
WE'VE HAD SEVERAL MARINES AT THE
HEAD.
THE LAST ONE WAS JOE FLOSS,
MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT AND
HE'S THE GUY THAT BROUGHT ME IN.
SO HE USED HIS -- THIS IS A
LEGENDARY FIGURE.
I'M CERTAINLY NO JOE FLOSS.
BUT I KNOW MARINES AND I KNOW
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND AIRMEN
FOR 17 YEARS, THAT'S ALL I DID
FOR US HERE AT FOX NEWS.
THERE ARE 23 MILLION ACTIVE DUTY
RETIRED AND RESERVE AND THEIR
FAMILIES.
AND I KNOW HOW TO REACH THEM.
WE DID 100 PLUS HOURS OF WAR
STORIES.
AND I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND
ENCOURAGE THEM, IN FACT, HERE IT
IS, JOIN NRA.ORG I'M GOING TO
TELL EVERYBODY GO TO THAT
WEBSITE ASK BECOME A MEMBER OF
THIS CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION
THAT'S GOING TO HELP SCHOOL
SHIELD, PROGRAM THAT WE STARTED
WELL BEFORE PARKLAND.
IF THEY HAD HAD SCHOOL SHIELD
PROGRAM IN THAT SCHOOL, IT'S
VERY UNLIKELY THAT THAT YOUNG
MAN COULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO THAT
SCHOOL WITH A FIRE APPLE
SCHOOL WITH A FIREAAPPLE
SCHOOL WITH A FIREARMPLE
SCHOOL WITH A FIREARM.LE
WHAT THEY'RE ASKING IS THIS
ORGANIZATION TO THE PULL IN AND
THEN WHAT TAKE THE GUNS AWAY?
PLEASE.
A HUNDRED MILLION MEN'S WITH
FIREARMS GOING TO TAKE THEM
AWAY?
A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RETIRED
SUGGESTS THAT WE TO THE REPEAL
THE SECOND AMENDMENT?
LET'S BE REAL HERE.
WE'RE OFFERING REAL SOLUTIONS TO
REAL PROBLEMS.
AND MY HOPE IS THAT --
>>  WOULD YOU SIT DOWN WITH SOME
OF THESE KIDS?
