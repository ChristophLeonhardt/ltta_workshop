was a mechanical problem okay less than
stellar outcome here our flight is like
delayed in that stop they booked us on
another flight which is later in case we
don't make this flight there's still a
chance we can make this flight but they
don't know this is a total bummer I'm
sure it'll be fine but it sucks right
now
honey worry boy
from that goal
spritzer we officially missed the flight
it's not happening but okay there was a
mechanical difficulty today but they
have us on a different flight that's a
totally different thing they made it
happen it sucks but it's also totally
fine we've got movement what's happening

check in we're getting a different
flight on a different airline to take us
through a different country
Candice bought the people at United
Airlines that helped us candles
but they were too expensive
