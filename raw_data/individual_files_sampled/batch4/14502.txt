our final speaker is an award-winning documentary maker columnist for national news papers radio talk show host of best-selling author she's a woman on a mission to tell the truth not being told from the systematic slaughter of white farmers in South Africa if you haven't heard about what's going on in South Africa this lady went out and he's telling the story that the media will not tell the plight of Christians in the Middle East her game is to tell the stories not being told we recently Acadia on our radio show to talk about her visit to Los Angeles's Skid Row another story of the media won't touch when she says it's the worst than the migrant camps in Europe in the Middle East we have such a positive response to that interview that we jumped on the chance to bring her to this event while she was in town please join me in welcoming the woman that sets Britain on fire Katie Hopkins hello trouble how y'all doing you're still with us yes you are you right there done what are you doing around my groin me too me too where's Hilary I need me to someone else in the White House but fair bit of time on their knees around her husband I think my name is Katie Hopkins and it's my very great pleasure to be here at the battleground talkers tour it's a pretty appropriate title right for right now at times it feels like we are all in a battle for what is right like we're at war for those against those who want to take our country to hell in a handcart with no brakes fighting for the countries we love fighting for the future of our children whom we love even more and from where I come from if there's a bit like living on the frontline if I'm honest with you we're fighting a war we brought on ourselves with open borders unchecked immigration and a knee high Muslim mayor of London who's about as useful as a chocolate teapot there is an alternative version to that featuring a cock flavored lollipop but it's too rude for this audience oh I apologize two stage management then there's the G Hardee's thank you sir 452 of them we welcome back to the UK we virtually bribed them back actually after going to work for Isis to kill the infidel in Syria and the Middle East we said no come back we will give you free homes free education for your multiple children from your multiple wives we will give you free healthcare you know personally I think returning jihadi our Miss nomer don't you you know they were supposed to go to Syria give it the old allahu akbar blow themselves up and get their 72 virgins in the process that's more than you'll find in new york on a good day too they failed and i wondered to myself if you're a returning jihadi how do you even live with yourself if you're a failure how can you live with that but then i realize they have to live with themselves because they were crap at blowing themselves up but I digress our returning jihadis of a perfect example of why Democrats and centrist cannot be trusted to run a country anyone who puts the human rights of terrorists before the right to life of our children has no place in power and in my country we have made ourselves into a laughingstock if you don't put on your best sympathetic and welcoming face around Muslim migrants and gee Hardee's in the UK you are branded Islamophobic and my own Islamophobia was brought about when to G Hardee's in the UK works on a plot to behead me a young woman maka ha ha ha ha ha age 21 she sounds like a regular Brit she wanted my head as a wedding gift from her jihadi boyfriend he was called Mohammed ah ha ha ha from Birmingham I believe she brought a dummy body and a hunting knife for him to practice with and they planned their attack on me I fantasize about Katie Hopkins head Tophet ah ha ha ha wrote she's the biggest bitch of them all yeah you better believe it sister but their plan was foiled the record of their conversations was used in evidence against them and they were sent to prison and they have now been locked up and I live to fight another day with you all thank you the Democrats usually boo at that point I am a white Christian conservative I am a wife and a mother and I am proud to be all of those things where I can farm I'm right up there on the endangered species list list with a black rhino and he has an advantage because he's black my children they're 13 12 and 9 and just like any other normal moms and dads they're the reason for my fight we're all fighting for the future of our children and our grandchildren and the country we love and my own country is in disarray you will have seen the murder rate in the UK is now greater than that of New York one day this week six young people were stabbed in just 90 minutes in London in that same 24-hour period a total of nine young people under the age of 20 lay dead or dying from knife attacks and you know what our chocolate teapot Muslim mayor's just suggested a ban on kitchen knives Oh genius we're not gonna have sliced bread anymore in the UK we're not allowed to cut it we just kept an oar away at it with that teeth but these are not random killings London has a black gang problem no one wants to talk about it because no one wants to be called racist just as no one wants to talk about the mass abuse of our white daughters by majority Pakistani Muslim men in case they're called Islamophobic but I am not afraid to talk about any of these things because it doesn't matter what labels you put on me because I know who I am young black kids are drawn to these gangs you know I get it a gang leader may be the first father figure any of these young guys have known at 6 & 7 they're running the drug deliveries at 9 they're learning the trade at 12 they're on motorbikes in London stealing phones and handbags and by 13 it's the only life they know if they make it to 16 then they're lucky they carry knives use mopeds to commit the thefts of phones and higher up the pecking order they commit high-value robberies by smashing in the windows of luxury jewelry and watch retailers on Bond Street the smart bit of London thieving millions of pounds yesterday a gang on motorbikes armed with machetes took out the window of watches of Switzerland and made away with their loot and escaped untroubled the rival gangs control different parts of London city they taunt each other online they stab each other as part of initiation or revenge and gloat about their killings on Instagram and the police are powerless to act the Left have gutted the power of the law it was said on Friday the Metropolitan Police have lost control of London they even had to call in another police force the City of London because they've run out of officers to investigate the murders the police can't stop and search for knives because it's racist you can't rat round up the gang leaders bragging about their killings on YouTube because it infringes their human rights and the kids know it they commit a burglary or theft on motorbikes and when the police give chase if they're around they throw their crash helmets into the curb because they know the police are not allowed to chase them if they're not wearing their safety helmets that is the UK in the UK we put the health and safety of criminals before Law & Order for the victims and our gutless politicians lacked the moral courage to make unpopular decisions and that's the thing these days too much time wanting to be liked pandering to criminals too little making the right decisions and accepting sometimes this will make you unpopular or being prepared to be challenged whilst the Met Police may have lost control of London one thing our nehi Muslim there really has cracked down on is hate online her t words the Metropolitan Police has 900 full-time officers some of senior ranked policing Twitter mostly my Twitter sat on their backsides in their wall offices reading social media never mind the fact that Kwabena Syed Hasan promised Rotimi or Luis just drop dead from stab wounds just around the corner or that little Laila a 16 year old was shot as she was the other day as long as a few oversensitive idiot snowflakes desperate to be offended feel vindicated by a police investigation then were a okay I'm delighted to announce that I was interviewed by the very same Metropolitan Police major Forces crime and homicide command for some words I wrote in a national newspaper ahead of the migrant invasion I said stop their boats how very racist of me the head of the UN Human Rights Commission read my article thank you sir and he said I was responsible for the uprising of hate in the UK not no not the 10 million migrants who invaded Europe not the majority Pakistani Muslim men raping our white daughters not the jihadis blowing up our children at concerts that they've gone to watch but me I was interviewed in a police station by two men in a taped interview under caution for 500 words in a newspaper and boy did I enjoy the speech I gave that day my barrister said it was the first time he'd seen two male police officers look more frightened than the person that had gone in to be interviewed you know I recount these horrors not to put my country down I love my country I joined the military to fight for my country went through Sandhurst your West Point but better as sponsored by sponsored by the Intelligence Corps we started as a platoon of 30 girls versus a hundred and eighty boys and nine girls made it through and I was one of them and now I fight for my country in a different way in the media and I am joined by millions of good people in the UK who are also ready to fight back and they live in a great little place called the rest of the UK outside of London is Stan like the rest of America outside of the Democrat californication of this country you know I receive letters from elderly men and women like my mum and dad your mum and dad 70 80 year olds and they tell me they're glad their time here is nearly up they tell me they're glad their lives will soon be over and they don't have to watch their country for so I come to America on their behalf to tell their truths and with one clear message do not let yourselves fall as we have fallen do not let yourselves become the UK defend the freedoms you have with everything you are and everything you've got USA you know there is still hope I feel it and I can feel it all around us I feel it in the 20 million Brits who voted for brexit I feel it when I fly here and I see your flag flying proud we're not allowed to fly ours because it's a nationalist symbol I feel it when I speak to a lovely lady at the airport who tells me she hasn't got a TV in her home because she will not allow her children to be brainwashed by the mainstream media but that I should keep going and I should keep speaking out because it matters I feel it and they feel it in Italy where the Socialists were just removed and the anti-immigration parties just won a massive victory and I feel it in Hungary where Viktor Orban is fighting right now to preserve the Christian culture that we need so dearly and the first indications Justin is that he's going to cruise to a victory of which we can all be proud and I feel it in Germany where the alternative for Deutschland is now second they are the opposition party and Merkel has been fatally wounded in the polls we are fighting back and we look to America we look to you for hope too because you have Trump yes you do and if you let him fall if you let him fail you will have me to deal with and I will come after all of you know it's a little harsh the recent exploits of the globalists from CNN to the crying kids from Florida has been a direct call to action for the United States in the midterms the Democrats will take away your right to bear arms and having watched them the kids from Florrick Florida the kff as I call them and their tears and their marched you know you are up against a carefully orchestrated emotional campaign back by Soros all the way and in this war for the midterms you good people are armed with facts firearms and the Constitution the Democrats are armed with tissues issues and tears and I know which side I'm on and I vote with my wallets he'll I recently became a card-carrying member of the NRA and I am proud I am proud to support the work that they do that you do thank you sir for your support today and I say to those children who spend their lives with their face planted on their phones obsessing over their tiny lives crying tears for the CNN cameras I say to you go stand at Mount Rushmore look up for once look into the faces of those great men who came before you read the Constitution a document that gave you everything I no longer have it protects your right to speak I was interviewed under caution for mine and I have 900 full-time police officers watching my Twitter feed it protects your right to bear arms and I live in a country plagued by crime G Hardee's are out to behead me and I'm supposed to defend my family with an electric toothbrush because we have no right to defend ourselves with weapons or words we are reduced to trying to survive an attack when it comes our government tells us what to do in a terror attack run hide tell what would my grandfather say who fought in the war what to do in an acid attack report remove rinse this is genuine what to do in a stabbing attack pressure police pressure how to be a good victim America is better than this your Constitution is your battle book against this but your challenge is to engage vote at the midterms to defend those freedoms defend your freedom of speech and that is not about standing on college campuses giving talks to kids that's not good enough it's not it's about using your freedom of speech not pontificating about it last time I was in LA a week ago I spent two days and nights with my cameraman he was thrilled to live on Skid Row I use my freedom of speech to reflect the reality of life under Democrats and the reality on Skid Row ladies and gentlemen is 4,000 desperate souls utterly lost drowned by life here in their tents and cardboard homes it's a sea of Filth of human waste of open sewers of needles and of rats running through it all it is London in the slums in the 1600s right before the outbreak of the bubonic plague and less than 20 minutes away from the palatial home of the Democratic mayor and this is how we use freedom of speech in the battle for the midterms with undeniable truths Skid Row and the lost souls therein are an undeniable truth of what happens when you have Democrats in power next up I'm thinking I might spend some time at the border a week or so I may get myself in the back of some of these wagons and expose the trafficking of humans at an industrial scale and I am going to work out who is waving through these van loads of illegals and I will bring those truths to our challenge in this midterm time is to drive these truths home to voters in order to fill the legislature with the populace we need to support Trump and enable him to fulfill his agenda we need to back the guy these midterms will be won or lost on the Second Amendment and I'm betting there are still more Americans willing to stand and defend this rights than there are to see their personal safety to politicians let the Democrats champion their causes let them celebrate the trans mafia let them push lgbtq FPC like it's a Justin Trudeau house party they can talk about their pussy marches all they want and where their daft little hats we don't care I saw placards my vagina's made of steel well guess what I can get a 24 ounce can of cause up mine sideways so I'm tougher than you any day of the week I gave birth to a 12 pound baby with no stitches I know what I'm talking about here let them shout black lives matter even as another 600 young black men are killed in Chicago and there's no March for that Republicans will use their free speech to tell undeniable truths look at my country what wouldn't I give for the right to bear arms as you do let the Democrats have their tissues their issues and their tears you are armed with facts firearms and the Constitution and I know which side I would rather be on you go you vote you keep Trump in power or you will have me to deal with and that's a direct threat thank you very much my consistent message to America is do not become like the UK do not let yourselves fall as we have fallen protect the freedoms that matter most to you you
