FORMER NAVY S.E.A.L. DAN CRENSHAW SERVED OUR COUNTRY FOR TEEN YEARS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE TOURS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, LOSING HIS RIGHT EYE DURING HIS THIRD DEPLOYMENT. HE'S NOT DONE SERVING. NOW HE'S RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN TEXAS AND JUST DEFEATED THE STATE REPRESENTATIVE FB STATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE REPUBLICAN SPOT. A NEW OP-ED, VOTE VETERAN TO GET THE JOB DONE. THIS IS PART OF A NEW IMPORTANT TREND? LET'S ASK DAN CRENSHAW. FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WIN. THANK YOU. YOU GOT TO THAT RUNOFF BECAUSE YOU WERE A DISTANT SECOND BEFORE THAT. MORE MONEY WAS SPENT BY OTHER CANDIDATES FROM OUTSIDE GROUPS FOR OTHER CANDIDATES. WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE RACE THAT YOU RAN THAT LED TO THAT VOTE WHICH IS 70/30 IS NOT A SMALL MARGIN OF VICTORY. OUR CAMPAIGN CAUGHT FIRE BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO INSPIRE OTHERS. I LIKE TO USE REAGAN'S QUOTE, THE GREATEST LEADERS ARE NOT THE ONE WHO DOES THE GREATEST THINGS, THEY'RE THE ONES THAT GET THE PEOPLE TO DO THE GREATEST THINGS. THEY REALLY DROVE OUR CAMPAIGN TO THE FINISH LINE. IT WAS AN AMAZING THING TO SEE. AN AMAZING THING TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE GET INSPIRED. THAT COMES FROM BEING AUTHENTIC, RUNNING AN HONEST CAMPAIGN. DON'T NECESSARILY TELL THE VOTER WHAT IS THEY WANT TO HEAR BUT BE CLEAR WITH THEM, HONEST WITH THEM. AND YOU SAY OUR COUNTRY NEEDS LEADERS NOT POLITICIANS. WHAT DID YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR THAT STILL DREW THEM TOWARD YOUR CAMPAIGN? WE TALK ABOUT HARD ISSUES, WE TALKED ABOUT ENTITLEMENT REFORM, THE REAL WORLD OUT THERE, THE REAL REASON WE HAVE TROOPS OVERSEAS AND WHY THAT MATTERS. THESE AREN'T YOUR TYPICAL POLITICAL TALKING POINTS BUT VOTER CONSIST VOTER CANSIST VOTER CAN TST VOTER CAN TAKE IT. THE VOTER IS SMART AS OPPOSED TO BEING DONE AND BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO OR THEY'LL ABIND WHAT TO DO OR THEY'LL ABIDE BY A CAMPAIGN AD BA US THEY SAW IT, YOU WERE ABLE TO KUBT YOU WERE ABLE TO CUBT YOU WERE ABLE TO CUTT YOU WERE ABLE TO CUT THROUGH THAT PUTTING THE FLAG FIRST. ABSOLUTELY. A LOT OF HARD WORK. VETERAN CANDIDATES ARE DISCIPLINED, WE'RE FAST LEARNERS AND WE CAN ADAPT TO FACTS ON THE GROUND. STAYING MISSION FOCUS IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THIS CASE. DID YOU THINK YOU COULD WIN? WE ALWAYS THOUGHT WE WOULD WIN. I TELL YOU WHAT, WE ALWAYS GOT TOLD RIGHT AWAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, WHEN THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT WE HOPE YOU STICK WITH IT. AND MY WIFE AND I SAW THAT, NO. HOW ABOUT WE JUST WIN. WHY WOULD WE PUT OURSELVES THROUGH THIS IF WE DIDN'T INTEND TO WIN AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID. WE'RE PROUD OF THE WAY WE RAN THE CAMPAIGN. IT'S NOT OVER. WE STILL NEED HELP GOING INTO NOVEMBER. SPHIEMS THE SOMIEMS THE SOMETMS THE SOMETIM THE SOMETIMESHE SOMETIMES THE POLITICAL CLASS CAN BE PATRONIZING. YOU BLEW RIGHT THROUGH THAT. PART OF THAT IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT SERVICE MEANS. THIS IS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. WE REMEMBER THOSE WHO GAVE EVERYTHING. AS A VET WHO SPENT SO MANY TOURS ON THE BATTLEFIELD, TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT MEMORIAL DAY MEANS TO YOU. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED. MEMORIAL DAY I MEAN IT IS ABOUT CELEBRATION. ACROSS AMERICA RIGHT NOW IT'S FESTIVE, WE'RE BARBECUING, FIREWORKS, WE'RE HANGING OUT WITH OUR FAMILY. BUT HERE'S THE THING. MEMORIAL DAY TO A DIFFERENT CLASS OF PEOPLE MEANS A DIFFERENT THING. AND THAT'S THE WARRIOR CLASS. THAT'S THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN OVERSEAS IN COMBAT AND IT'S THEIR FAMILIES WHO HOLD DOWN THE HOME FRONT. TO THEM, HERE'S WHAT THEY ASK. THEY ASK THAT YOU DO NOT FORGET TO REMEMBER. AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. AND HERE'S ANOTHER THING WE SHOULD BE ASKING OF PEOPLE. REMEMBER WHY THESE MEN AND WOMEN FELL IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THEY FELL SO THAT WE COULD LIVE. SO THAT WE COULD CONTINUE SERVING OUR COUNTRY AND SERVE
