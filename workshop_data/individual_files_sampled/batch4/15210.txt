the mammoth voting session on brexit happened last night and nobody including the media and the politicians are quite sure what really happened for the last week or so I've been talking about the 12th of June where there's a mammoth voting session planned which happened last night were members of parliament voted on a customs union trade and the EU withdraw a bill and it happened last night and the media the politicians nobody seems to really quite understand what happened it's amazing really so everybody's confused they can't work out whether there's been an acceptance there are no deal breaks it could happen so we don't know if no deal breaks it is off the cards whether any concessions have been made or whether remainders have won or lost in this instance what we do know is that the reason may technically wasn't defeated amazingly nuts not what I expected at all the Daily Mirror reports today Theresa May wins crucial brexit vote after last-minute flying down to stop a Tory revolt Theresa May has scraped through a crucial brexit vote after she made a frantic last-minute climb down to stop a Tory revolt the Prime Minister survived a day of chaos that saw a minister quit over her handling of brexit she is defeated calls to give mp's a meaningful vote on her plans for leaving the EU which could have blocked a No Deal breaks it the meaningful vote by the way the meaningful vote really is basically just allowing members of parliament to vote against brighter meaningful vote people's vote whatever whatever you want to call it it's an attempt by politicians to reverse the results of the 2016 referendum but back to the article the ambitious bid was passed by the House of Lords and it looks like it had enough support to pass the Cohens but MPs defeated it by three hundred and twenty four votes to 298 a healthy 26 majority after Tory ministers made a compromise just minutes before the vote happened so may has won with 26 votes she didn't need to do it before the Lewisham by-election after all because that one vote wouldn't really cover thanked today still this is a healthy 26 majority 324 to 298 I mean that's 298 members of parliament who are effectively in my eyes in the eyes of most voters I think voted against brexit that's quite a lot of people you know half of parliament is a game the worlds of people amazing given the whole point of Parliament is to represent the people and so may has won this vote somehow but what was the compromise well BBC daily politics asked the art remainer and a sue Bri what was promised to her by Tereza may to get the remain as two votes in favor of the government and this is what she had to say to the daily politics what was promised to you at that meeting with Teresa may yesterday well the prime minister I mean do forgive him a bath right Prime Minister gave her word as she said it's a matter of trust that that there would be an amendment in the Lord's that would essentially address a and B of the Dominic grief amendment and that was in relation to in the event of no deal by November crudely of this year that the minister would come or rather the government would come with a motion to the house as to what their negotiating position was now going to be because no deal had been struck and then there was what we call the C part now I know you've been talking to Claire about this and that is more controversial because that relates to February and I understand that the argument of the government is that that is too binding on their negotiating position and that is to be discussed now between the Solicitor General and Dominic grief and between them and perhaps some others they will come up with an amendment that was what the prime minister gave her word that they would do in the Lord's essentially to cover a and B and come to some agreement in relation to no deal having been struck by February I have to say I think this is very unlikely but it's imperative we do this in case there is no deal so it seems like there's two things to consider here one is if a deal isn't done by the 30th of November may is gonna have to draw a whole new plan and then ask the MPs to vote on it that's one of the the compromises she's made to the remainders to get them to vote for her but also the other issue is that the Solicitor General Robert Buckland is now talking with other officials to come up with a new amendment that might well decide what will happen if there's still a no deal by February and this is where the confusion lies is a no deal option possible or not at this point can we have a no deal brexit will the government be allowed to a walk away from the European Union say No Deal were done negotiating here you know do a trump is that allowed well the Guardian reports rebels said May had assured them the government would accept two parts of greaves amendment and immediately open talks on a third part C which would allow MPs to direct the government if no deal is reached by February next year the government would have to give him he's a vote on the next steps if Parliament rejects the brexit deal or if no deal has been reached by the end of November since there is certainly no majority or among MPs for no deal which all but a hardcore Greg the ultras believe would be disastrous that now makes no deal extremely unlikely so no deal is unlikely probably near impossible as Theresa May just offered MPs the chance to vote on brexit if no deal is reached but if that's true then it flies in the face of what the levers are saying yeah because the levers are denying the claims by remainders that the PM will let them veto a no deal so one side saying if there is a no deal by February by November we're going to have a vote on it but the levers at the same time is saying no actually the PM is not giving them a veto on a No Deal breaks it what the hell is going on so the song man reports but amid chaos last night leavers flatly denied remain as claims that missus may have allowed them to veto any No Deal walk away senior brexit ears insisted that the PM had told them the exact opposite just minutes later and had promised the rebels nothing but a discussion number ten faced massive pressure to clear up the confusion a senior brexit here in the government told the son if Teresa has sold us out here she is in real trouble there is no way she can recover if she is F does over that's interesting isn't it so it looks like the remainders are now saying that she did promise them some kind of vote if there isn't no deal but minutes later she told the exact opposite to the levers and the senior brags a tear in the and telling the Sun if Teresa's sold us out here she's in real trouble obviously it seems like the rags of tears and the remainders in the Tory Party have been salt different stories by Theresa May or at least have been some confusion along the way so not only do we not know what's going on with Briggs it not only does the media not know exactly what's going on with Briggs it following this man a floating session which has been such a big deal it seems like the politicians don't even know and that's a problem the ambiguity over Briggs it must end it's only getting worse as time goes by I mean it's one thing the public not knowing what's going on with brexit robot politicians talk in tongues we know that but it's another thing when the politicians themselves don't even know what the hell is going on the mega voting session that happened on June the 12th hasn't cleared up anything at all it was meant to be a defining era a defining part of Greg's it but it just made things more complicated instead it seems like now the remainders are angrier than ever for being tricked by Theresa May and the brags of Tears are saying that if she's effed them now then she's effed later on I don't know who I can't stand more at this point labour and Lib Dem remain errs or the rebel remain errs in the Tories who are betraying their own voters and betraying the basic concepts of conservatism it's time that people like Anna sue Bree are held to account I think those who've stand in the way of the people should resign resign their seats and the Conservative Party should replace those remain as in the Conservative Party with new candidates who are Pro breaks it Teresa may call a general elections why not in the face of all this uncertainty why not throw another general election into the mix but you know what you might win this time if you got rid of all the remainders replace them with grexit candidates and not only would you sweep up across the country you'd form a majority government and you could pass brexit and have a good legacy a real legacy that you can be proud of gone serezha may do it if you like that
