BETSY DEVOS HAD A NUMBER OF
SESSIONS WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO
WERE EITHER VICTIMIZED BY ACTUAL
ASSAULT ON CAMPUS, OR PEOPLE WHO
SAID THEY WERE ACCUSED OF ñ
PEOPLE WHO WERE VICTIMIZED BY
BEING ACCUSED OF CAMPUS SEXUAL
ASSAULT.
THIS IS ALL PART OF ROLLING BACK
SOME PROTECTIONS THAT WERE
PUT IN PLACE BY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
EARLIER THIS WEEK, DEVOS ANGERED
ADVOCATES FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT BY AGREEING TO MEET WITH
MEMBERS OF MEN'S RIGHTS GROUPS,
WHICH ARGUES THAT MEN ACCUSED OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE TREATED
UNFAIRLY BY COLLEGES UNDER THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S TITLE IX
GUIDANCE.
THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR MEN
HAS A HISTORY OF INTIMIDATING
VICTIMS BY PUBLISHING IDENTITIES
OF WOMEN WHO SAY THEY MADE
SURE THEY SAY MADE FALSE
ACCUSATIONS.
THE OTHER GROUP THAT WAS THERE
IS KNOWN AS SAVE, AND THE
SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER HAS
ACTUALLY LISTED THEM AS A
MISOGYNISTIC ORGANIZATION, AND
HONESTLY, I WAS REALLY CURIOUS
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF INTERACTION
THEY HAD, AND WHAT THEY SHARED
WITH BETSY DEVOS, AND REFINERY
29 ACTUALLY HAD A REALLY GREAT
PIECE WHERE THEY PROFILED ONE OF
THE MEN WHO CLAIMS THAT HE'S
BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT, BY HIS OWN FRAT
BROTHERS, AND SO YOU DON'T HEAR
ABOUT SITUATIONS LIKE THAT VERY
OFTEN, AND HE'S SAYING, I DON'T
ACTUALLY WANT YOU GUYS TO GET
RID OF TITLE IX, OR THE
PROTECTIONS THAT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION PUT INTO PLACE,
BUT WHAT HE DOES CALL FOR IS
INCREASING THE BURDEN OF PROOF
THAT UNIVERSITIES NEED TO
HAVE IN ORDER TO FIND SOMEONE
GUILTY.
NOW, KEEP IN MIND, THE WAY THAT
UNIVERSITIES HANDLE IT IS
SEPARATE FROM THE WAY THAT
CRIMINAL COURTS HANDLE IT, SO
THIS IS REALLY OVER WHETHER OR
NOT A STUDENT SHOULD BE
EXPELLED OR REPRIMANDED, OR
FACE ANY CONSEQUENCE IS FOR
ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT.
THERE'S A LOT MORE, IT'S VERY
COMPLEX, TWISTY-TURNEY
STORY, I WANT YOU GUYS TO JUMP
IN.
IF BETSY DEVOS SAID, HEY LISTEN,
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT
ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, OF COURSE,
BUT SOME SMALL FRACTION OF CASES
ARE FALSE ACCUSATIONS ñ AND I
SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IS A FACT,
IT IS ABOUT 2 ñ 10% OF
ACCUSATIONS ARE FALSE, ACCORDING
TO THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP STATS ON
IT ñ BUT IT EXISTS, SO LET ME GO
MEET WITH ONE OF THESE GROUPS.
AND THEN I WOULD PICK THE GROUP
THAT IS THE LEAST CRAZY.
THEY DON'T EXIST, UNFORTUNATELY.
I HEAR YOU ON THAT, THAT'S
RIGHT.
SO, I WOULDN'T PICK ONE THAT WAS
ON THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW
CENTER'S LIST OF GROUPS THAT ARE
MISOGYNISTIC.
THE ONE THAT THE NATIONAL
COALITION FOR MEN, I READ A
QUOTE FROM THEIR FOUNDER A FEW
DAYS AGO ON THE SHOW WHEN SHE
WAS CONSIDERING DOING THESE
MEETINGS, HE SAID THE RAY RICE
THING, I'M NOT VICTIM BLAMING,
BUT YOU KNOW, SHE AGITATED
HIM, AND THAT'S WHY HE HIT HER.
WHAT?
IF YOU SAW THAT TAPE.
HE KNOCKED HER OUT WITH ONE
PUNCH, AND COULDN'T CARE LESS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN AGITATED HIM?
IT'S CLEAR VICTIM BLAMING.
THESE ARE BAD, BAD GUYS THAT
SHE'S MEETING WITH, IF YOU WANT
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND
IDENTIFY THE SCOPE OF THE
PROBLEM, THAT MAKES SENSE, I
WANT GUYS TO BE FALSELY ACCUSED
OF RAPE.
BUT THE PEOPLE YOU ARE MEETING
WITH OUR TERRIBLE GUYS.
THE SENSE THAT I GOT FROM THE
WAY THAT THIS ALL WENT DOWN WAS
THAT HER ASSUMPTION OF THIS IS
THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS ARE
50%, AND FALSELY ACCUSED ARE
50%, SO LET'S TREATED AS SUCH,
AND I'LL HAVE MY SESSION WITH
THE VICTIMS, AND THOSE WHO WERE
FALSELY ACCUSED.
THE REALITY IS, NOBODY WANTS
ANYBODY TO BE FALSELY ACCUSED,
IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND
DEVASTATING FOR EVERYONE, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME YOU WANT TO ENSURE
THAT YOU TACKLE A PROBLEM THAT
CONTINUES TO GROW ON COLLEGE
CAMPUSES, AND THAT IS
ADMINISTRATORS BRUSHING THESE
THINGS UNDER THE RUG, AND
NOT DEALING WITH THEM.
AND BY THE WAY, UNIVERSITIES ARE
NOT COURTS; THEY ARE NOT
LOOKING FOR CRIMINALITY, OR TO
CONVICT SOMEONE.
THAT'S FOR THE CRIMINAL COURT
SYSTEM TO DECIDE.
WHEN IT COMES TO UNIVERSITIES,
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR
NOT MAKE IT MAKE SENSE TO MOVE
SOMEONE TO A DIFFERENT DORM OR
EXPEL SOMEONE, AND IN THE VAST
MAJORITY OF CASES, ACCORDING TO
THE DATA, THE PERSON ACCUSED OF
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT DOES NOT GET
MOVED TO ANOTHER DORM OR
EXPELLED, THEY MIGHT GET
ASKED TO TAKE A COUNSELING
CLASS, BUT THAT'S IT.
THE WASHINGTON POST LOOKED AT
DATA AT OVER 100 UNIVERSITIES,
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT,
VERY OFTEN, OR MORE THAN OFTEN,
THEY ARE NOT EXPELLED FROM
UNIVERSITIES; VERY OFTEN THEY
ARE TOLD TO TAKE THESE
COUNSELING CLASSES.
BUT YEAH, LIKE, BUT THESE GROUPS
WANT ñ THE MEN'S ACTIVIST GROUPS
ñ IS, THEY WANTED TO BE THE SAME
BURDEN OF PROOF NECESSARY IN
CRIMINAL COURT.
SO, GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE
DOUBT, AND SO THE UNIVERSITIES
ARE ACTUALLY SAYING, THAT MAKES
OUR JOB IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE
WE CAN'T PROVE THAT.
AND IT'S ALREADY TOUGH TO PROVE
IN CRIMINAL CASES, WHICH WE ALSO
NEED YOU READJUST HOW WE
CONCEPTUALIZE BURDEN OF PROOF
FOR CRIMINAL CASES, BUT BACK TO
YOUR EARLIER POINT, ABOUT THIS
CONVERSATION, YOU CAN'T CENTER
MEN IN A CONVERSATION WHERE MEN
ARE THE PRIMARY PERPETRATORS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS, AND I
THINK ALSO, YOU CAN HAVE
MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT
SEXUAL ASSAULT.
2 THINGS CAN BE TRUE, THERE CAN
BE FALSE ACCUSATIONS, AND THERE
CAN BE REAL SEXUAL ASSAULT, BUT
TO GO FIRST, AND THEN TO FRAME
THESE VICTIMS AS EQUAL TO OTHER
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT I
THINK IS PROBLEMATIC.
SO, IT IT'S A TOUGH BALANCING
ACT FOR UNIVERSITIES, AND IF I
WAS WORKING FOR THE DEPARTMENT
OF EDUCATION I WOULD THINK,
LOOK, HOW DO I MAKE SURE THAT
UNIVERSITIES DON'T BRUSH
THIS UNDER THE RUG?
AND THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO,
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR
UNIVERSITY TO GET A BAD NAME,
AND IF THERE'S A LOT OF ASSAULTS
REPORTED AT A UNIVERSITY THEY
GET A BAD NAME, LESS PEOPLE
APPLY, IT AFFECTS THEIR FUNDING,
ETC.
SO I HAVE TO STOP THAT PROBLEM,
BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS,
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT ENORMOUSLY
SERIOUSLY, AND MAKE SURE THAT WE
GET JUSTICE FOR THAT, MAKE SURE
THAT THE VICTIM DOESN'T HAVE TO
FACE THE PERSON WHO DID IT, ETC.
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN THEY GO
TO ACTUALLY ADJUDICATE THE CASE,
I THINK BEYOND A REASONABLE
DOUBT IS TOO TOUGH IN THAT
STANDARD, ALTHOUGH I DON'T AGREE
THAT IT IS TOO TOUGH IN THE
CRIMINAL CONTEXT, I THINK IT'S
THE RIGHT STANDARD, BUT WE
CAN DISAGREE WITH THAT.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T
WANT THE COLLEGE TO SAY,
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S ANY
EVIDENCE AT ALL THE GUY IS GONE.
NO, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME REAL
STANDARD, AND MAYBE IT'S THE
SAME STANDARD AS A CIVIL CASE,
BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE
EVIDENCE.
BECAUSE, WHEN YOU GO TO A
CRIMINAL TRIAL, YOU ARE
TAKING SOMEBODY'S FREEDOM AWAY,
AND ON A CASE LIKE RAPE,
YOU ARE GOING TO GO ON A SEX
OFFENDER CASE, I MEAN THAT
IS AS SERIOUS AS YOU CAN
POSSIBLY GET.
NOW, REMOVING SOMEBODY FROM
COLLEGE, ENDING THEIR COLLEGE
CAREER, IS ALSO SERIOUS, BUT
IT'S NOT TO THE SAME
DEGREE, AND IT'S A BALANCING ACT
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PROTECT
SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS, AND
WE HAVE THE STATS; THE
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
WHO ACCUSE PEOPLE OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT, ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND
WE KNOW THAT THROUGH THE
CASES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN
ADJUDICATED, ETC.
SO, IT'S NOT AN EASY BALANCING
ACT, BUT YOU DON'T BALANCE IT
50-50, THAT'S JUST NOT THE
REALITY OF WHAT IS
HAPPENING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.
AND WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS,
EVEN AS THEY ARE GIVING THIS
APPEARANCE OF TREATING THINGS AS
IF THEY ARE 50-50, WHICH WE ALL
AGREE IS UNFAIR GIVEN THE
STATS, BEHIND THE SCENES THEY
DON'T TREATED AS 50-50.
DEVOS'S TOP CIVIL RIGHTS CHIEF,
CANDACE JACKSON, STIRRED OUTRAGE
WEDNESDAY WHEN HE TOLD THE NEW
YORK TIMES THAT 90% OF
ACCUSATIONS FALL INTO THE
CATEGORY OF, WE WERE BOTH DRUNK,
WE BROKE UP...
SHE LATER APOLOGIZED FOR THAT
STATEMENT, BUT, I MEAN, YOU
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE YOU GET
CRITICISM, YOU SAID SOMETHING
THAT YOU HONESTLY BELIEVED, AND
THAT'S A LITTLE TROUBLESOME, SO.
IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE CASES DON'T
EXIST.
WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AT
PENN, WE LITERALLY HAD ONE
OF THOSE CASES, WHERE SOMEBODY
SAID, SINCE MONTHS LATER,
ONE OF THE NIGHT IN OUR
RELATIONSHIP I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE SEX, BUT WE HAD SEX, AND
HE DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT I'M
GOING TO CALL IT RAPE NOW.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW ALL THE
DETAILS, AND THAT WAS A LONG,
LONG TIME AGO, AND MAYBE SHE HAD
A POINT, BUT FROM THE OUTSIDE IT
LOOKS LIKE, WHOA, SIX MONTHS
LATER, AND THE GUY DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW IT.
SO IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE CASES
DON'T EXIST, BUT FOR HER TO SAY
THAT 90% OF THE ACCUSATIONS FALL
INTO THAT CATEGORY IS
UNBELIEVABLE, BUT THAT'S THEIR
MINDSET, THAT'S THEIR
PERSPECTIVE, IT'S A LOT OF BS,
THAT A LOT OF THESE SEXUAL
ASSAULT CASES DON'T ACTUALLY
HAPPEN, WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE
CANDACE JACKSON IS ACTUALLY A
SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR, BUT
HAVING NO EMPATHY SHE TURNS
AROUND AND SAYS THAT EVERYONE
ELSE IS MAKING IT UP, EVEN
THOUGH THE STATS INDICATE
IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH 90 ñ
98% OF THE TIME.
