and incredibly deadly attack on a high school was thwarted this week by alert students and cops in Utah I'm gonna tell you why the National mainstream media has told you nothing about it alert students and cops boarded an attack at the Pine View High School in st. George Utah this week that could have killed more than Sandy Hook more than the attack in parkland I possibly could have killed more than those combined there was an explosive device left in a backpack now if that had been detonated in between classes or during a recess or the end of school it could have killed dozens and dozens of students and faculty members what you've heard nothing about this it's been buried in all but local Utah news some local television affiliates some light print why because it was an Isis inspired attack they still haven't released the name of the teenager who planted the bomb now they did raid his home they found materials consistent with the materials in the IEP an improvised explosive device but you've heard nothing about this because the culprit in this case was radical Islam and not firearms see the mainstream media doesn't have any interest in reporting on a Muslim terror attack inside of a high school now think about how terrifying this is this should be front-page news if you watch the show with youth watch my show from the beginning here on the rebel if you've listened to my radio show over the years you know that I say the thing that keeps me up at night when people pose to me whether I talk about it on my own shows or whether I go on fox business or HLN or any of the other various TV shows I do quite often they ask me as a professional who analyzes this what scares you what attacks are you worried about this one this one the low-tech asymmetric attack an attack that doesn't require chatter in other words there's nothing for the intelligence agencies law enforcement to intercept there isn't a cell of terrorists all chatting with one another and we're picking up the community Asians and piecing that puzzle together and then receiving actionable intelligence so the operators can take what the analyst gave them and go out and stop the attack you don't need that for an attack like this this is one teenager this is one teenager with some scientific know-how who understood how to go by certain off-the-shelf materials and build a very deadly potentially very fatal bomb but you're not hearing about this from the mainstream media because it's Islam inspired it was a Muslim terror attack now they're admitting it was an Isis attack but they didn't even need to because the attacker the terrorist this teenage Isis inspired terrorist I don't want to say Isis inspired I want to call him an Isis fighter because that's what he is Isis inspired takes the mainstream media's sanitization of this the downplaying of this and enables it when when you engage in in a plot to try to kill dozens upon dozens of innocence high school kids and faculty members ever doing nothing but going to school and going to work you're a terrorist you're not Isis inspired you are Isis now Isis has been incredibly effective at recruiting via the internet via social media and so an Isis fighter in Utah planning a backpack bomb in his school we're not sure if he's a student there but I'm going to assume he was in his school or a school is every bit as much an Isis fighter as the ones on the battlefield in Syria it doesn't matter what your theater of terroristic operations is it just matters that you're part of them and you did it so this is is every bit every bit as serious a security breach as was parkland parkland of course far more tragic because the attack was able to be carried out and even here I would argue the attack was able to be carried out the bomb was left in the school it was just unsuccessful and that it was found by alert students police there canines they were able to safely remove it and no lives were lost so outstanding job all around by the student-to-faculty and law enforcement in st. George Utah but this was still an attack it was still successful insofar as the terrorists got the device of death to the intended soft target but now talking about that we're not going after these school administrators for an another soft target because no gun was involved this does however raise some very uncomfortable but necessary constitutional questions questions about regulating guns being okay but regulating Islam which has killed thousands upon thousands upon thousands worldwide not being okay to speak about and I'm going to be going very deep into that exact question on my longer show off-the-cuff Declassified a full hour we're gonna do in a very long segment on this today right here on the rebel this is very very important content I'm gonna be asking some very important and uncomfortable questions on my longer show off-the-cuff Declassified and I'd love you to watch it but please subscribe to our premium service at www.wrc.org comm and sign our petition have Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel removed from office by Florida Governor Rick Scott we need to get serious about school safety this is getting out of hand go to the App Store whatever your app device is download our rebel app great way to get all of our content as always if you've done one or any of those things thank you very very much I want you to do them all and as always thanks so much for watching I'll see you tomorrow you
