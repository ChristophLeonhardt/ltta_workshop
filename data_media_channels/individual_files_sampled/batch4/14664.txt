I went back to the Edmonton women's March this year I still don't understand what the March was all about except self-delusion and first world grievance mongering let me show you what I saw when I was there and then I'll tell you what I didn't the women's march in Edmonton was held on the steps of the legislature January 20th to commemorate well I'm really not all that sure but it is held on the anniversary of Donald Trump's inauguration so I guess I don't know that something but a thousand people one quarter as many as reported for last year's event showed up so that's actually pretty hopeful news for normalcy right now I went there and I was as inconspicuous as I could possibly be since I didn't need a repeat of what happened last year when I was pretty easily identifiable as myself from the rebel media here's a brief refresher for those of you who don't know what happened to me at last year's women's March I will bring you time so to avoid any politically motivated violence against me while I'm simply just trying to have a conversation I didn't bring my usual camera kit I went there completely as an observer who happened to have a small camera I went there this year to observe the local feminists in their natural habitat with the rest of the herd sort of like a wildlife photographer I was there to get the story not be the story now as best as I can tell from the signage this was a pro-communist pro-abortion Pro vagina rally for people who don't think they have all the same rights as everyone else but actually do oh and there was a hefty amount of delusion with regard to hillary clinton's aspirations for the presidency it was basically an NDP rally for the proletariat ladies and all their beta male friends anyway this year there were three brave souls representing us normal folks they were a man his son and his son's younger brother the older boy was bravely waving a trump make America great again flag on the end of a hockey stick and trying to engage in some reason civil debate with the people around him guys not all heroes wear capes okay I went over and started eavesdropping as he was trying to explain to the young communists of Alberta why their ideology is murderous and wacky here's some of that fairway live well yeah do you think it doesn't have to do with the fact that Dawn killed 20 million people I spoke to the young man's father about his thoughts on the women's March and the message of the women's March whatever that message might be here I look back and I see I don't see ones that I've beautified voices why are these women not standing up for Iran and what's being oppressed over there look what's happening right now there the people are taking to the streets to fight against people that believe in Sri Sri law where Sharia law oppresses women now the dad makes a great point here is iranian-born liberal MP Maryam on Saif at the women's March she'll show up for an anti-trump March complaining about being oppressed in the middle of NAFTA renegotiations at that but she can't March or even send a tweet to support the women fighting for actual human rights in her birth country of Iran and those women are being disappeared and tortured for their efforts now I was finally able to speak to the young man about why he came down to a vehemently anti Trump rally with a trump flag just listen why did you come out here with your Trump flag I'm so bad to get a rise out of some people just to see how far they would go just to see someone who disagrees with family so far nothing violent but I haven't called very rude names they've been accusing me of kind of like well not accusing me but they're like oh I'm protecting you for my daughter's yes I overheard them calling you a rape apology yeah rape let's go to jail in our country now on to what I didn't see or rather what I didn't hear not one of the speakers and neither one of the two co-organizers even addressed the elephant on the legislature grounds and I I suppose that elephant was me or rather the violence that happened to me and the feminists who saw what happened but helped my attacker escape into the crowd and then told me that I was the one who is asking for it these are the sorts of feminists who claim to be marching against violence against women to the very extreme point that they would consider the heterosexual male gaze to be some sort of micro aggression against women one of the organizers Paul Ackerman even made sure that one of the ground rules was that there was no swearing at her event yet she couldn't acknowledge what happened there the year before I was assaulted by a male feminist at their rally and just like how Hollywood has turned a blind eye to Harvey Weinstein and other Hollywood predators for years and years and all sharing the same politics the feminists in Edmonton are turning a blind eye to the violence in their own midst for the exact same reason the person who assaulted me while he shares their politics I don't share their politics so tribalism and not righteousness nor intellectual consistency when the day this time and worse yet the feminists in Edmonton just set a very dangerous standard the message they send is that you can assault a conservative woman and you don't even have to leave their tribe it's not even worth bringing it up they put a target on all of us now women like me we don't matter to feminists we have the wrong opinions and we don't see ourselves as perpetual victims in need of endless emotional and special rules so that we can succeed we just believe in merit and hard work despite the violence against me last year I went to that women's March I strolled right in unafraid because I refuse to be scared and bullied and threatened out of doing my job I don't need the acknowledgement of my political enemies and feminists nor the mainstream media who refuse to ask questions of the organizers about what happened to me last year or how the organizers would make the changes to keep women like me saved this year you know asking the questions the mainstream media would ask of any conservative if I hadn't gone to the women's March this year it would mean the bullies have won the politically motivated violence against me would have been effective that they you know got the best of me does it seem like they have for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read did
