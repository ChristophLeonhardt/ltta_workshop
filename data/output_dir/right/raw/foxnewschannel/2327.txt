DOUBT.

172
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,935
IT'S A COMMITTEE OF FIVE WHO AR

173
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:18,569
CHOSEN BY THE NORWEGIAN

174
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,873

THIS IS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.

183
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:35,185

190
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:47,598
TOWARD NORTH KOREA HE HAD AT

191
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,533
DISCUSSION WITH THE SOUTH KOREA

192
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,268
DEFENSE MINISTER THAT WE MIGHT

193
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:51,969
RETURN OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO BE

194
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:52,202
RETURN OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO B

195
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:53,637
DEPLOYED AGAIN IN SOUTH KOREA AS

196
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:53,871
DEPLOYED AGAIN IN SOUTH KOREA A

197
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,539
AS MANY AS 800 OR MORE.

198
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,875
OTHER KIND OF PRESSURE WAS

199
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:02,379
MASSIVE IN VERY FOCUSED

200
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,247
SANCTIONS EVEN ON THE ROYAL

201
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:04,181
FAMILY IN THE NORTH.

202
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:06,083
THIS IS NOT YOU'RE NORMAL

203
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,519
IDEALISTIC MAKE A SPEECH KIND O

204
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,187
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE CANDIDACY.

205
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:10,988
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GOT

206
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,723
RESULTS.

207
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:14,258
THE RESULT CAME ONLY THROUGH

208
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:14,758
PRESSURE.

209
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:16,694
I THINK THE CHINESE ALSO HELPED.

210
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:19,363
FRANKLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP LINKING

211
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:19,663
FRANKLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP LINKIN

212
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,999
TRADE AND THE DELEGATION GOING

213
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,267
NEXT WEEK TO HELPING WITH NORTH

214
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,936
KOREA WAS A VERY BOLD GESTURE

215
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,071
HEAVILY CRITICIZED BY THE

216
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,604
LEFT-WING MEDIA.

217
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:30,341
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS A STROKE OF

218
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:30,574
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS A STROKE O

219
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:30,908
GENIUS.

220
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:31,675
THE CHINESE HELPED US ON NORTH

221
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,978
KOREA.

222
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,679
>> LAURA:  I THINK THAT'S A

223
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:36,113
GREAT POINT.

224
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:38,148
RILEY, I WANT TO GET YOU ON THIS

225
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:38,382
.

226
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:40,984
FRANKLY, I'M A LITTLE WORRIED

227
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,654
WITH THE LINKING OF CHINA TRADE

228
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,488
TO NORTH KOREA.

229
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,656
OBVIOUSLY THE CHOICE BETWEEN

230
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:49,526
NUCLEAR WAR OR THE CHINA 2025

231
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:50,260
PROGRAM WHERE THEY DOMINATE

232
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,865
EVERY MAJOR INDUSTRY, IT IS NOT

233
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,166
THE EASIEST OF CONCERNS TO LOOK

234
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,570
AT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM BOTH.

235
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,171
WE CAN'T ALLOW CHINA TO DOMINATE

236
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:01,405
WE CAN'T ALLOW CHINA TO DOMINAT

237
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:01,972
HIGH-TECH.

238
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:05,776
WE CAN'T ALLOW CHINA TO DOMINATE

239
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:06,009
WE CAN'T ALLOW CHINA TO DOMINAT

240
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:06,777
3D PRINTING, COMMERCIAL AVIATION

241
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,946
, BUT THAT IS THEIR

242
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:09,446
SUBSIDIZING GOLD.

243
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:10,214
THEY ARE DOING THAT ACROSS EVER

244
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:14,151
INDUSTRY, AND I'M WORRIED THAT

245
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:15,486
DONALD TRUMP IS SO FOCUSED ON

246
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:17,221
THE NORTH KOREA DEAL, THAT WILL

247
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:18,756
LET UP THE PRESSURE ON CHINA

248
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:19,990
THAT ALSO IS NECESSARY.

249
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,626
SO FAR HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB.

250
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:23,994
TO GET THERE IS DEFINITELY A

251
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:25,262
DIFFERENCE IN OPINION OF WHAT IS

252
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:25,496
DIFFERENCE IN OPINION OF WHAT I

253
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:26,630
THE IMMEDIATE THREAT FROM NORTH

254
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,133
KOREA AND THE FUTURE THREAT FROM

255
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:29,366
KOREA AND THE FUTURE THREAT FRO

256
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,100
CHINA REPRESENT.

257
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,035
OBVIOUSLY LAST NIGHT WAS

258
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:32,803
HISTORIC IT WAS SETTING UP

259
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:35,639
TOWARD THE UPCOMING MEETINGS

260
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,607
BETWEEN THE LEADER OF NORTH

261
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:38,909
KOREA AND DONALD TRUMP.

262
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,944
CHINA'S ROLE IN THIS GOING

263
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:46,717
FORWARD IS SKEPTICAL I THINK.

264
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,519
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA HAS THE

265
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,620
NORTH KOREAN LEADER COME VISIT

266
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,054
HIM ALMOST OUT OF THE BLUE IN

267
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:51,855
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT A COUPL

268
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,658
OF MONTHS AGO TO PREEMPT HIS

269
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:55,359
VISIT OR THE NORTH KOREA'S

270
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:58,228
LEADERS VISIT WITH SOUTH KOREA

271
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,797
IN THE UNITED STATES.

272
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:01,165
I THINK THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE OF

273
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:01,865
THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN

274
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:06,837
APPLYING HAS BEEN INFLUENCING

275
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,205
AND INCENTIVIZING NORTH KOREAN

276
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,239
SUCCUMB TO THE TABLE AND THAT

277
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,608
CHINESE TO RECIPROCATE.

278
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:12,443
TAKE CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO PLA

279
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:14,344

FAVORITE FRIENDS ON THE OTHER

SIDE OF THE AISLE WHO REFUSED TO

282
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:18,782
SIDE OF THE AISLE WHO REFUSED T

283
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:19,483
GIVE PRESIDENT TRUMP EVEN A

284
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:22,519
MODICUM OF CREDIT HERE.

285
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,356
LET'S WATCH.

286
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,192
>> PEOPLE SIT AND TALK ABOUT

287
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,026
DONALD TRUMP OR ANYBODY IN NORT

288
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:33,330
OR SOUTH KOREA WINNING THE NOBE

289
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,231
PEACE PRIZE.

290
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:35,466
KEEP MY MESSAGE FOR PRESIDENT

291
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,301
TRUMP TONIGHT IS CURB YOUR

292
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:38,368
ENTHUSIASM.

293
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,136
DON'T SET UP UNREALISTIC

294
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:41,137
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE SUMMIT THEY

295
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:41,371
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE SUMMIT THE

296
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:42,105
THAT KEMPE PROPOSAL BECAUSE IF

297
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,174
YOU DO HAVE THESE EXPECTATIONS

298
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,509
AND APPEALS, THAT MAY DRAW US

299
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,277
CLOSER TO WAR.

300
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,079
>> THIS WAS THE SHOW THAT NO ON

301
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,013
ELSE IS IN CONTROL AND CHINA AND

302
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:50,247
ELSE IS IN CONTROL AND CHINA AN

303
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:53,350
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT IN

304
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,851
CONTROL.

305
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:54,618
THE TWO KOREAS ARE SEIZING THE

306
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,620
PROCESS.

307
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,524
>> LAURA:  OKAY.

308
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:01,592
THEY JUST CAME TOGETHER.

309
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:03,327
IT WAS LIKE PIXIE DUST AND THEY

310
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:04,828
CAME TOGETHER.

311
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:05,596
THAT LAST COMMENT OF ALL THE TOM

00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:05,829
THAT LAST COMMENT OF ALL THE TO

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,331
COMMENT I'VE HEARD, THAT LAST

314
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,733
COMMENT WAS AMONG THE MOST

315
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,034
MORONIC.

316
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:15,072
TAKE ONE, THE PRESIDENT FOR

317
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,173

.

320
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,911
>> LAURA:  HE CANNOT LET UP ON

321
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:21,445
CHINA.

322
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:23,447
THEY ARE RIPPING APART AT EVERY

323
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,481
TURN.

324
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,415
JUST BECAUSE IT HELPED ON NORTH

325
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:26,917
KOREA DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN LET

326
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:29,052
THEM UP BECAUSE THEY ARE POISED

327
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:29,820
TO DOMINATE ALL THESE INDUSTRIES

328
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,456
.

329
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:32,890
>> ABSOLUTELY.

330
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,958
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE BECAUSE THE

331
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:35,759
PRESIDENT HAS SHOWN STRENGTH.

332
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,427
HE WILL SHOW STRING FOR CHINA.

333
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:39,596
YOU'RE YOU SEE THEM CAVING IN.

334
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,832
HERE IS THE DEAL, THE WITHERING

335
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,901
CRITICISM OF FOLKS ON THE LEFT,

336
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:46,069
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW THEY WOULD

337
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:47,371
BE BEHAVING IF BARACK OBAMA WAS

338
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,272
PRESIDENT AND YOU HAD EVENTS

339
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:50,674
LIKE LAST NIGHT.

340
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,743
I AM RUNNING FOR THE UNITED

341
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:53,377
STATES AND AGAINST THE

342
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:54,411
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WHO LIKE ALL

343
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:55,812
THOSE OTHERS ON THE LEFT HAVE

344
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:56,480
CRITICIZED THIS PRESIDENTS

345
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,783
DIPLOMACY.

346
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:01,385
TWITTER DIPLOMACY IS WORKING.

347
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,119
NORTH KOREA HAS COME TO THE

348
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,687
TABLE IN A WAY THAT MOST OF US

349
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,356
WOULD'VE NEVER IMAGINED JUST A

350
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,724
FEW MONTHS AGO.

351
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,092
YOU CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW BIG OF

352
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,627
A DEAL MUST NIGHT WAS.

353
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:11,628
OF COURSE, THERE'S A LONG WAY TO

354
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:11,862
OF COURSE, THERE'S A LONG WAY T

355
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,232
GO, BUT WE ARE HERE BECAUSE

356
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:17,467
AMERICA IS SAFEST WHEN AMERICA

357
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:18,735
IS STRONG.

358
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:19,836
WITH THIS PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT

THE WORLD STAGE.

TO HAVE A FENCE LIKE WHAT IT

362
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:28,545
HAPPENED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS IS

363
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:28,779
HAPPENED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS I

364
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,447
JUST ANOTHER BIG STEP IN THE

365
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:30,948
RIGHT DIRECTION.

366
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:31,615
I AGREE WITH YOU.

367
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,850
WE'VE GOT TO BE STRONG TOWARD

368
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,251
CHINA.

369
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:34,985
THIS PRESIDENT IS STEPPING

370
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:35,652
FORWARD TO GETTING TOUGH ON

371
00:10:35,652 --> 00:00:00,000
CHINA IN A WAY THAT HASN'T
