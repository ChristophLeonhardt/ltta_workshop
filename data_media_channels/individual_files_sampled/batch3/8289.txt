Trace: ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT MULTIPLE INFORMANTS THAT HAVE PENETRATED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN THE FALL OF 2016? IF IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE, HEAR THE REASONING BEHIND THIS. FORMER TRUMP AIDE QUERIED BY MICHAEL CAPUTO THANKS FOR BEING BACK. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. Neil: SO YOU'RE CONVINCED THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL? YES, I AM. TO MY APPROACH, IT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY OF 2016. FAR OFF THE TIMELINE THAT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION AND OTHERS ARE TRYING TO HOLD TO IT TO WHEN THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY BEGAN. Trace: SO WHEN YOU SAY MAY OF 2016, WHAT HAPPENED? THE DISCOVERY OF SOMEBODY PENETRATING THE CAMPAIGN OR WHAT? I WAS APPROACHED BY AN ENTER MEDIATORY WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, A FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, THAT TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD HILLARY CLINTON-RELATED E-MAILS AT THAT GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION AND THAT THEY WANTED TO GET THEM TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THIS WAS MAY 6 THAT HE HEARD THAT IN 2016. I WAS TOLD BY THE INTERMEDIARY THAT THEY WANTED TO GET THEM TO ME. THIS CONTINUED BACK AND FORTH SEVERAL DAYS. I WAS IN TRUMP TOWER AT THE TIME WHEN I GOT A CALL. I WOULD WALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE. I SPENT TIME IN THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE FIFTH FLOOR OFFICE TALKING TO THIS ENTER MEDIATORY. Neil: AT TRUMP YES, SIR. Neil: ALL RIGHT. SO YOU YOU'RE A TOP CAMPAIGN AIDE IN THE SPRING OF 2016. THIS INTERMEDIARY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT'S A FRIEND OF MINE THAT IS WILLING TO GO ON THE RECORD AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE'RE HERE ON YOUR SHOW TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT NAMES OF PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS. HE WANTS TO BE ON THE RECORD, HE'S WILLING TO TALK TO FOX. HE AND I WERE BOTH AMAZED THAT WE WERE GETTING THIS KIND OF A CONTACT FROM A GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION. Neil: WHO WAS TALKING TO THE INTERMEDIARY OR WHAT GOVERNMENT AGENCY? WHAT COULD YOU SAY? I CAN'T SAY THE NAME OF THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY. IT WAS A FORMER CONTRACTOR FOR THAT AGENCY THAT SAID THE ACTUAL STAFF MEMBERS OF THE AGENCY HAD HILLARY CLINTON'S RELATED E-MAILS. WE BELIEVE THAT TO MEAN AT THE TIME, EARLY MAY, HILLARY CLINTON HAD REVEALED THAT SHE HAD DELETED 30,000 E-MAILS AND WE BELIEVED IT MEANT THAT THEY HAD THOSE 30,000 E-MAILS. BY THE WAY THE TIME MAY 16 CAME AROUND, I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THESE E-MAILS. I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS. I URGED THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY THAT THE PEOPLE AT THE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION DO IT THROUGH A PROPER WHISTLE-BLOWER PROCESS. I NEVER REVEALED THIS CONVERSATION TO ANYONE AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT IT. I THEN BROKE OFF CONTACT WITH THAT GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION REPRESENTATIVE. Neil: BUT YOU KNEW THEN THAT SOMEONE FROM THE OUTSIDE WANTED TO CONNECT WITH SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, BEGINNING WITH YOU. THAT'S RIGHT. I LEFT THE CAMPAIGN ON JUNE 20th. THAT SAME PERSON, THE FORMER CONTRACTOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION REACHED BACK OUT TO THE INTERMEDIARY IN THE END OF JEWEL TRYING TO GET HIM INTERESTING AGAIN IN THOSE E-MAILS. HE AGAIN REFUSED TO WORK WITH THEM ON IT. WHAT REALLY DISTURBED ME AT THE TIME, NEIL, I YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN BRINGING IN THIS KIND OF INFORMATION. I THOUGHT IT MADE ME LOOK COOKY WHEN I CAME IN TO TELL THEM I HAD ACCESS TO HILLARY CLINTON'S DELETED E-MAILS. THEN IT WAS FRIGHTENING FOR ME. IT COULD BE A CRIME FOR ME TO TAKE THEM IN MY OWN CUSTODY. LATER ON I WAS I GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. I GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND I GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO THE MUELLER TEAM. THEY NEVER REACHED OUT TO THE INTERMEDIARY TO CHECK ON IT. Neil: SO YOU RAISED TO BE CLEAR, YOU RAISED THIS ISSUE WITH MUELLER'S TEAM WHEN THEY WERE QUESTIONING YOU. THEY DID NOTHING? THEY WEREN'T EVEN INTERESTED. THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE TAKING NOTES. I OFFERED THEM THE TIMELINE Neil: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT? YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE FROM THE POSSIBILITY TRYING TO PENETRATE THE TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. DID THEY FOLLOW YOU UP ON THAT? THEY DIDN'T. INTERMEDIARY WHO WAS WILLING TO GO ON THE RECORD ABOUT IT. I HAVE THE TELEPHONE NUMBER OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE THAT WAS TRYING TO GIVE THIS TO US. I DON'T THINK THEY CALLED HIM AS WELL. HE'S KIND OF GONE SILENT. Neil: WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU WHEN THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED IN THAT? I WAS PUMPED UP ABOUT THIS FROM THE BEGINNING. AT FIRST I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN I WAS ASKED BY THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN ALL-IF ANYONE OFFERED ME E-MAILS, THEY ASKED ME IF ANY RUSSIAN OFFERED ME E-MAILS. DIDN'T COME TO MIND THAT SOMEONE FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT APPARENTLY WAS TRYING TO OFFER ME E-MAILS. I CAME BACK TO THE HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE AFTER RECALLING THIS AT LATER DATE AND GAVE THEM THAT TIME LINE. DIDN'T SEEM TO INTEREST THEM EITHER. Neil: THERE'S SO MUCH YOU CAN SURMISE FROM THAT. I WOULDN'T OFFER ANY CONJECTURE. KNOWING THERE'S ONE PERSON I WOULDN'T OFFER ANY CONJECTURE. KNOWING THERE'S ONE PERSON TRYING TO PENETRATE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND MAYBE MORE, DID IT DAWN ON YOU THE DIMENSIONS OF THAT AT THE TIME TO SAY NOTHING OF LATER ON WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO MUELLER AND HIS FOLKS? I'LL TELL YOU, AT THE TIME IT DIDN'T YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT WAS ODD. I THOUGHT IT WAS PERILOUS FOR ME TO GET MY HANDS ON IT. YOU KNOW, I FRANKLY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT MUCH AFTER THAT. THEN THE E-MAILS WERE RELEASED IN OCTOBER FROM WIKILEAKS. I REMEMBERED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PERSON WHO WAS CONTACTING ME THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY TALKED ABOUT THE SWEDISH OR WAIVER ON DEALING WITH IRAN THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE SWEDISH COMPANIES RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THAT THEY GAVE $26 MILLION TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. THAT CAME OUT IN THE WIKILEAKS E-MAILS IN LATE OCTOBER. I BLEW MY MIND. I REMEMBER THEN I WAS NOT ON THE CAMPAIGN BY THEN. I REMEMBERED THAT THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY. TO ME IT STRUCK ME WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WIKILEAKS E-MAILS THAT SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME IN MAY. Neil: STARTLING. A LOT OF QUESTIONS HERE AS TO WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING THIS, WHY WERE SEVERAL
