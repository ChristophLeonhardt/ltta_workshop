hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaizen report you know what we're in Paris Paris France City of Light city of beauty City of Enchantment speaking of enchantment Stacey you know so many times on YouTube people will say it's not pronounced like that it's pronounced like this so my question to them is well should we start calling it Perry right yeah absolutely I've totally gravy on that point I actually I'm not sure where that comes from but it's something that one experiences in France is an obsession with grammar pronunciation word usage syntax because that's what makes this country great the the financial Institute the Institute of language integrity to make French the language of the world English is in retreat French is on the rise actually I was not talking about French people I was talking about ordinary Americans and British people who live in their mother's basement or attic and they talk about they like to correct everybody online and blah blah blah and they say oh you pronounced you know the Italian guy's name wrong or something like that but I do not say Perry and I do not say Swami for Finland I say I say Finland right they say aluminium what do they know exactly they don't have to speak English good they're so you know who speaks funny is a Donald Trump and Donald Trump has been tweeting a trade war with China and well many other nations including the EU where he's threatening to slap a 20% tariff on imported cars from Europe but stock market investors are acting as if a genuine us-china trade war has erupted has a tip for tariffs bet between China and the US shifted from a skirmish to a full-blown trade war that is certainly how financial markets have been reacting tensions took a turn higher last Tuesday after President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on as much as four hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese goods further ratcheting up tensions between the two largest economies in the world yeah well you know all the trade that's been going on for decades kind of got into these channels of tray that nobody's questioned for decades and Trump is questioning what's going on Andrey architecting global trade in a way that would probably be fair more fair fair trade you know I speaking of mispronunciation this is kind of why I set this up is that there's this little stand country Eastern European country called Kyrgyzstan creases expand and I know I'm probably mispronouncing it but nevertheless they are right there between China and Russia and they are getting ready for this trade war between the United States and China and they've also had to deal with the sanctions against Russia and the fact that it's caused their own currency to crumble so they've been starting to buy massive quantities of gold and gold buying is in the headlines as well this is the universal language of money is if trade wars and crazy stuff starts happening and mispronouncing of basically on misunderstanding of art of of where the United States is as many people are unable to understand what Trump is talking about and where this is going a lot of nations have been buying gold so Russia dumps Treasuries for gold this is from Bloomberg although investors usually seek safety and US debt Russia cut its holdings of Treasuries nearly in half in April as Washington slapped the harshest sanctions to date on a selection of Russian companies and individuals in a shift Danske Bank attributed to a deepening geopolitical standoff Russia is instead keeping up its purchases of gold quote some people ask whether the Russian central bank sold them to support the ruble in April but it's about changing allocation as reserves continue to grow said Vladimir miklaszewski senior economist at Danske Bank in Helsinki rising US yields have fueled the sell-off right well global debt to GDP is almost a 300 percent you know countries like Japan it's way higher and one big central bank of the world in 2018 2019 will go bust probably the Bank of Japan but could be the European Central Bank and that will be enormous catastrophe in the financial sector and gold will be a safe haven play and Russia is anticipating this because it's been trying to do trade with the West for a long time 15 years 16 years under Putin and West America keeps rejecting this overture let's trade let's trade but they keep categorizing and putting Russia into the camp of this is why Hillary lost and they don't want to do trade America has given up on being a free-market economy it wants to be a top-down pull-up Bureau driven price-fixing Central Bank led dystopian economic nightmare so Russia is saying okay fine we'll just keep buying gold until this thing blows well it's not just Russia's many countries we're gonna get to that in a bit but I think you know there's this notion that when a tsunami is coming when a big major event whether it's a collapsing Empire or a massive wave that's gonna wipe out half your country is that you know some people have the instinct some animals have the instinct in when the Asian the Boxing Day tsunami a few years ago about a decade ago the elephant's famously ran off into the woods carrying some of the tourists on their back and they're like what's going on well they knew is coming well you know we humans went out there looking at the water retreating but the same thing is some nations seem to have a more protective instinct perhaps you probably is like countries that have had more turmoil and history of of collapse and history of war and history of invasion in the recent history Namie metaphor there you know before the tsunami hits the tide goes out yes very hard we're seeing that quantitative tightening yes so these banks are saying we're gonna reverse our quantitative easing and we're going to make credit harder to come by so the credit spigots are hardly the tide is moving out and then they get to the point where they figured you know what this is impossible in fact because even a quarter point rise in global interest rates will cause catastrophic deflationary bond failure across every major economy in the world they'll come back with a multi hundred trillion dollar quantitative easing money printing tsunami and then that's when it hits that comes back and then that's when it have a hyperinflationary move and gold and Bitcoin and everything that's not printable well all the signs are there it's just whether you read it and protect yourself whether you are that elephant that runs for the hills or the human they goes out further into their retreating tides that suddenly all the water retreated and people went out there to take photos so here in this story they are saying that Russia has 62 million troy ounces of gold now which is 80 point five billion dollars but Russia sold forty seven point four billion of Treasuries in April more than any other major foreign holder of the US securities even as its reserves grew on the back of rising oil prices is stockpile forty eight point seven billion dollars is down from a 2010 peak of over a hundred and seventy six billion ranking it now only twenty second worldwide according to data this is what the chart looks like that's the plunge and the recent plunge sell-off in Treasuries that is again they're the biggest in terms of the percentage of their holdings but other countries are also reducing their holdings including Japan but they're reducing their holdings of Treasuries while US consumers and pension funds are expanding you know I was surprised when I visited Moscow when you go to an automatic teller machine you see dispensing both rubles and dollars and I think psychologically Russia should get rid of any ATM dispensing dollars and they should put rubles and Bitcoin and this would educate the public about what's coming and how to protect themselves that's a good idea and in an article on golds and marco burns cite gold core he has a follow up on this story from bloomberg about russia buying six hundred thousand ounces of gold and he has some other interesting details in here so russia by six hundred thousand ounces of gold in may after dumping half of US Treasuries in april it is not just Russia that is diversifying into gold in recent months and years India Turkey Mexico Iran Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan Belarus whose Becca Stan Tajikistan Mongolia and of course China have been increasing their gold reserves as well Trump's erratic and risky economic and foreign policies pose a risk to the dollar as the reserve currency of the world so I think you know even people like Jim Rickards who have been on the show we covered that years ago when the u.s. pulled the trigger on Swift when they cut Iran off from the system is that's always a threat they had the ability to do that but once they pulled it all other you know nations outside the five eyes sort of guys outside of Canada Australia New Zealand and the UK start to think well are we going to be next but even like Canada is now in that group of people who are being a called you know unfriendly nations and Canada has no gold at all they know everything you know China and Russia are getting cozier they're building the heat Silk Road the New Silk Road project combining you know continents and they want to do business outside of the dollar and so it makes sense for both China and Russia to be accumulating lots of gold china is now expanding their gold mining operation no gold leaves China you never see a gold bar with a Chinese symbol on it because none of it ever gets out of China they're hoarding it and Russia's buying it and their people are waiting for the dollar to finally kind of reach it's come up ins well if China is the next dominant power it doesn't seem like they want to replace it directly with that it seems like something that will be end up gold backed or commodity back to if they if you look at what they're how they're positioning their own portfolio so the deterioration however in the US fiscal and financial position has been happening slowly for many years but accelerated under Bush - and Obama that of course sounds like Hemingway's he went bankrupt slowly and then all of a sudden that's the way it always happens right Trump inherited a heavily indebted US with nominal debt just under 20 trillion dollars it was exactly nineteen point nine trillion but in just 17 months this is increased by another six percent to 21 point one six trillion there are unfunded liabilities as well of around a hundred trillion dollars right and that is supposed to be paid down by increased tax revenue thanks to tax cuts but those taxes never appear there's never enough taxes even to pay the interest on the debt that's when you get into a hyperinflationary Doom loop is when the interest on the debt is greater than your taxes taxable base then you have to throw down all pretenses of quantitative easing and just admit you want monetizing debt central bank is just printing and buying back its own debt in a Doom loop of inflation then you get into what's called a banana republic named after countries in Latin America that typically are in the banana business who end up doing this monetization of their own debt and have collapsed and their currencies Venezuela Argentina come to mind this is now going to be contagious and going into America well Marco Bern sums it up as we are moving to a multipolar world which will see trying to become a more dominant player and Trump is exacerbating this trend but you know one way to try to understand what Trump is doing and it's very difficult is you look at it and you wonder if maybe this is his plan is you know he's he ran for president as a nationalist and make America great again and basically retreating from the world this he's you can't deny he's doing that when he's even dissing Canada hard in Germany and you know these are classic US allies and you know we get closer and closer in our policies and and trade deals merge closer and closer over the past 30 40 50 60 years so he's just like ripping it apart just totally ripping up the paper and throwing it on the ground but you wonder if this is like his nationals policy to basically force others to leave us to ourselves so I had a chance to chat with Steve Bannon a few months ago and I tell them people misinterpret this it's not about American isolationism it's about American being hyper competitive make America great again means we want to be the greatest competitor in the world that's different than this isolationist interpretation anyway we got to go to the second half so don't go away much more coming your way right after this break welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to return to our conversation with Pierre jovanovich he's a journalist at quotidian calm and also you were recently described as the Pope of fake news yeah what's that all about Pierre I leave for a few years and everything goes crazy what's happening Lou Mulder which is one of the let's say the most important theoretically newspaper in in France say that I'm the Pope of fake news because I'm giving financial news to people so I guess you're the new Protestant Pope of fake news in oh yeah in in England and the United States yeah I'm going with Jesus Christ oh well that's my goat you know what the Vatican they have two popes who I guess were to pull the cottage right next to the Basilica with his boyfriend or something right is that my story and then they became very liberal when he moved in I don't know if you are very aware of that the Pope wrote something two weeks ago and he condemned the Pope at the Vatican he condemned this the credit default swap of mrs. Blythe masters ten years mastered the false one years after so he used to Pierre Giovanna pick at the Vatican yeah but and you're the poem big news but you say you guys are two sides of the same coin you speaks through the Oracle of truth and you're both attacked for it and the Catholic Church's holder derived on and a vicious attack on a truth teller from 2,000 years ago well it's it's very strange but I think that the the reason of direction of the Pope on this on on on the city s is that they are extremely aware that the situation might explode any day or any months whatever and they want to to be able to say we warned you we warned you in case of the whole thing stops right well I mean this is an interesting territory so let's get into this this kind of interesting because it goes into the history of banking and finance in Europe and the Vatican has always played a big role in financial affairs all over Europe for hundreds of years and we know that they've been involved in all kinds of questionable deals throughout history and during the financial crisis the Vatican Bank was actually involved in some of the lending that went on exactly exactly remember the one thing the banker have left is secrecy I mean I think you agree with that but remember GP Morgan in Milano it was I think in 2010 or 2012 maybe they say we have an account with the Vatican but we call them to to say that what we drop them and they cannot do business anymore I remember that you remember yes I did we covered it on the show of course you know we spoke we spoke David right and remember Visa MasterCard and American Express they cut the Vatican City with they had like 50 or 60 Visa Visa credit card terminals so in in the Vatican and for for seven days I think they were not able to do business at all so that was the way the banking system said to the Pope well we are in charge now and you have nothing to say right and of course Vatican is an interesting location physically in the political sphere because it shares a unique attributes along with the city of London and Washington DC and that they are their own little countries within countries and so they willed enormous power which is not documented and not well known and they tend to collude they work together Washington Europe Vatican and they wield enormous strength in doing things like assisting Goldman Sachs in the destruction of Greece where Germany ends up making billions of euros that was all orchestrated at the highest levels it wasn't because the country suddenly went bankrupt because a few pensioners didn't pay their taxes it's because it was a thought-out premeditated financial assassination conducted by john paulson hank goldman sachs Lloyd Blankfein and a few other bankers and probably in direct compliance and complicity with the vatic yes or now we can say yes because the Vatican have has a tremendous real estate mostly businesses and specifically in London and I don't I think it's the BBC or the Telegraph of London or who gave the information without a very interesting investigation on it the the company who owns all this real estate in London had the same address as the GP morgan bank and another company owns another one and the the final company has the same address as the JP Morgan in New York so that's the connection between the Vatican and I've known you for a number of years now and what you do and what I do is kind of similar in that will pick up the Financial Times and we will read what's printed on the page and we will read the footnotes and we'll just read what's there like we're not making stuff up we're just saying what's in the newspaper but it's not in the lead paragraph it's in the fifth or sixth paragraph down and then we just say well if that's true and it was the banker who said at this the particular fact then we also must know that this is also true just because we're adding two plus two and getting four doesn't make you the Pope of fake news and doesn't make me some freaking propagandist for some freaking developing nation it is what it is facts are facts but this is what they're saying about you right this is whether they say throw the election of Mexico just because I read the Financial Times oh it's because I'm reading The Wall Street Journal right so therefore we're immediately suspect because the average dinkle brain out there doesn't know you know how to look past their iPhone and they'd have no idea about economics or finance and they would give their mothers away for another like on Facebook as part of being inculcated in a true immersive fascist state of no economic or financial or press freedom whatsoever the Facebook's of the world what a Facebook do to you Facebook I had 60 thousand people are following me oh no on my personal Facebook and they just cut it off just before the election in France because I was giving the list the the huge list of layoffs in an inference and in Europe because of a broad cell and when my followers fold until like twenty thousand they give my facebook back to two and a half years later this is how it works on my Wikipedia pages in Spanish English French Italian and Chinese were taken off I mean it is this is absolutely amazing because my book are translated in different languages right so it's immediately suspect so what is the current state of play here in in Paris in France what is the thought you know it doesn't seem as though there is a feeling of a crisis at the moment but tell me you know what's your view the man on the street what's what's the thought going through people's head here the thought here is that McCune might do something good because they all knew that we're in a disaster financial state so the average French people say he's a banker he's a financial from the financial world he might find solution to save us I don't think he's going to save a friend at all but maybe in one year or a won-young half people will rat - totally differently and you know we have the election group an election next year and you will see a total censoring Atlas ensue on all internet in France just to help Brooke cell where people to be reelected they will they cannot afford to see what happened with Donald Trump let's say Germany France and the United Kingdom because they voted for brexit and initially it looked like that it was going to go off you know was it was gonna happen but now we were almost two years into it and it looks like it's a complete disaster in Germany is is playing hardball and the Great Britain looks like they're gonna get the worst of all possible worlds and it was a complete disaster what's the view from here Europe in France toward braixen the basically the English have never been in Europe pair exactly because they kept their own money don't forget that they were not in the eurozone so we don't care very much if you have a control at you know at the rail station European or not you're open you have a control so it doesn't change anything do business don't don't care too much about breaks it or not breaks it I mean that the links between France and England or you know hundred years old now so but they're between Germany and France that's it's not very very good Macomb and Merkel their relationship is extremely bad because of the migrant the immigration is she vulnerable because they took in a lot of migrants in Germany she's very vulnerable now and I've seen as soon as you did of course that she is in she might be in danger in the next couple of weeks let me know stirred macro picture here you know my theory is that you know you have a situation where Trump is trying to downsize the American military budget or try to save money because America isn't debt so he does a deal North Korea they're gonna pull out of Korea in my view pull the weapons out then he looks at NATO and says you know why do we have all this military in Germany let's dump it so then if the US pulls out of Germany militarily it pulls out of NATO doesn't that kind of force Germany into the arms of Russia no not really the Germans are really pro Americans that's that's for sure okay so let's not let's roll with that so you're saying that there is there the huge affinity there and the the dynamics of World War two are still in place and so what if let's say the u.s. pulls out militarily pulls out a lot of hardware from Germany what would is that a possibility do you think at all the two people think about that no take a look at what happened last week I mean pentagons and I don't like four or five hundred special forces in Finland or no way and they keep sending people and sending people to build a kind of wall american wall against the russia so from what we see from here is that the americans want to have a war either with china or with Russia this is what you will see I mean there is no reason to bring in Europe even more tanks and artillery and and so for us if you don't want if you don't want to Wow well what's the point of it they want to have a war so American cannot reimburse their huge debt the only way to escape this depth is to have a war because when a country is in more they you know they don't have any kind of debt to to pay fair enough Pierce thanks so much for being on the Kaiser report again thank you maximum mercy at one okay well well I think we're to try a now you know what we're like informal bloomie buddy-buddy go back go back go back Veuve was that more pot no absolutely okay we got to go that's gonna do it for this edition of the kinds of report with me thanks guys are in Stacy Herbert like to thank our I guess pure jovanna Vic he's an author of all kinds of books he's also quotidian calm if you want to reach us on twitter it's Keiser Report until next time uh yeah
