00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,959
AS THE HURRICANE WAS BEARING
DOWN ON FLORIDA, A FACEBOOK POST

2
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:24,740
WENT UP EARLY ON ñ IT DESCRIBED
ITSELF ñ IT WAS A FACEBOOK

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,570
POST ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SHOOT
INTO THE HURRICANE.

4
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,850
THEY ARE NUTS.

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,530
WE WILL GET INTO WHETHER IT WAS
SARCASM OR NOT BUT LET ME

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:44,320
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW MANY
PEOPLE LIKED THAT IDEA.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:53,440
IT GOT SO CRAZY AND SO POPULAR
THAT THE LOCAL SHERIFF HAD TO

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,420
PUT OUT A TWEET SAYING DON'T
SHOOT AT THE HURRICANE.

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:06,730
HERE IS THAT TWEET.

10
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:14,650
IT EXPLAINS HOW IF YOU SHOOT A
BULLET INTO A HURRICANE IT COULD

11
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,070
SWIRL AROUND AND COME BACK AND
HIT YOU.

12
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,840
I LIKE THE RIFLE IN THE CORNER.

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,610
IS SHOWING YOU IF YOU FIRE IT
SOMETIMES WILL COME BACK AROUND.

14
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,720
THERE ARE A LOT OF GROUPS
INCLUDING TERRORIST GROUPS

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,501
THAT LIKE TO CELEBRATE BY
SHOOTING GUNS IN THE AIR.

16
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:36,340
THEY ALSO DON'T TAKE GRAVITY
INTO ACCOUNT.

17
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,590
SHOOTING INTO A HURRICANE IS A
DISASTROUS IDEA.

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,890
BUT IT IS UNIQUELY AMERICAN.

19
00:01:46,890 --> 00:02:04,520
RYAN EDWARDS, THE GUY THAT PUT
UP THE POST LATER 

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:14,470
SAID THIS.

21
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,800
LET'S TAKE RYAN AT HIS WORD.

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,079
THE WAY HE PHRASED IT, IT DID
SEEM LIKE SARCASM.

23
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:36,239
OF THE 50,000 PEOPLE WHO LIKED
IT I'M SURE A LOT OF THEM ñ

24
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,030
OBVIOUSLY THE SHERIFF WAS
CONCERNED ENOUGH TO PUT UP

25
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,389
A PUBLIC NOTICE SAYING YOU
SHOULD NOT DO IT.

26
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,189
IT REMINDS ME OF THE SIGN I SAW
ON THE HIGHWAY IN MIAMI

27
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:50,500
THAT SAID DON'T STOP IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,940
IF YOU HAVE TO CLARIFY THAT WE
ARE ALREADY IN A BIT OF TROUBLE.

29
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,099
ONLY IN AMERICA DO YOU HAVE TO
REMIND PEOPLE DO NOT SHOOT

30
00:02:59,099 --> 00:00:00,000
AT THE HURRICANE.
