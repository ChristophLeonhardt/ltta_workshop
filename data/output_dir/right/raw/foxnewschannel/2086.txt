I MEAN, THAT'S A PRE-CONDITION

00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:56,652
KOREA.

32
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:59,255
I'D LIKE TO SAY THE NORTH KOREAN

33
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:01,690
LEAD TOWER SAY WHETHER THEY'RE

39
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:22,544
DAYS, AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

40
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:25,080
DEAL WITH THIS ROGUE NATION.

41
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,349
>> MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND I

42
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,517
UNDERSTAND THE CRITICISM.

43
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:29,618
BUT MANY THINGS ARE GOING ON

44
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:31,186
THAT MADE IT WISE FOR THE

45
00:01:31,186 --> 00:01:32,187
PRESIDENT TO SAY THAT.

46
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:34,189
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF

47
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:36,225
DISCUSSIONS, IT'S NOT JUST THE

48
00:01:36,225 --> 00:00:00,000
U.S. VERSUS NORTH KOREA.
