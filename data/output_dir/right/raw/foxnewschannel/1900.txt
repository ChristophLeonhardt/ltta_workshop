1
00:00:00,138 --> 00:00:02,174
BUT DOES IRAN RESPOND TO THAT

2
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:03,875
STRIKE AGAINST THEIR FACILITIES

3
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:05,310
IN SYRIA.

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:05,610
SHEP?

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,878
>> Shepard: THANKS, BENJAMIN

6
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:07,512
FROM JERUSALEM.

7
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:10,749
LET'S GO TO MICHAEL O'HANLON AS

8
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:14,720
WE OFTEN DO FROM BROOKINGS

9
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,321
INSTITUTION, A NONPROFIT PUBLIC

10
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:16,888
POLICY ORGANIZATION.

11
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:17,723
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:18,156
THANK YOU.

13
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:20,826
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEP.

14
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:22,260
>> Shepard: BIG PICTURE.

15
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,530
THE ISRAELIS SAY THE IRANIANS

16
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,235
TURNED THIS UP SENDING MISSILES

17
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:30,969
OVER THE BORDER.

18
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:34,539
DID THEY AND WHERE ARE WE?

19
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:40,479
>> ASSAD HAS LARGELY WON THE

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,046
CIVIL WAR.

21
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:42,214
IRAN WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

22
00:00:42,214 --> 00:00:42,514
THAT.

23
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:44,316
THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE MILITARY

24
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:46,518
FORCES IN TO BE POSITIONED TO

25
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:49,221
SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON AND

26
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:51,456
ALSO TO MENACE ISRAEL ITSELF.

27
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,258
THIS IS A BAD OUTCOME, ONE OF

28
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:56,294
THE MANY BAD OUTCOMES OF THE

29
00:00:56,294 --> 00:00:57,395
SYRIAN CIVIL WAR.

30
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:58,997
OBVIOUSLY ISRAEL DOESN'T HAVE

31
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:01,533
THE OPTION OF MARCHING GROUND

32
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,235
FORCES INTO WESTERN SYRIA.

33
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:05,137
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF AN

34
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:08,273
ARMY TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY.

35
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:12,811
WHEN THEY TRIED TO OCCUPY

36
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:21,253
LEBANON, THEY RAN OUT OF POWER.

37
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:26,458
WHEN THEY SAW WEAPONS GOING TO

38
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:26,825
HEZBOLLAH.

39
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:32,497
THIS HAS BEEN BREWING FOR SEVEN

40
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:37,035
YEARS AND IT'S LARGELY

41
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:38,003
INEVITABLE AND ONGOING.

42
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:41,973
>> Shepard: WILL THE IRANIANS

43
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,775
STRIKE BACK?

44
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,310
THAT COULD CAUSE A REAL

45
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,710
ESCALATION.

46
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,646
>> I THINK THEY WILL STRIKE

47
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:47,946
BACK.

48
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:49,915
IT'S SORT OF THEIR NATURE, NOT

49
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:51,416
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE, OF COURSE.

50
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,519
BUT THE HARD-LINERS THAT YOU

51
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,220
JUST TALKED ABOUT.

52
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,855
SO I THINK THEY WILL.

53
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:59,758
THEY MAY NOT DO IT INSIDE OF

54
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:01,993
SYRIA OR IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF

55
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:02,594
ISRAEL.

56
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,896
IT MAY BE IN SOME OTHER PART OF

57
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:06,998
THE BROADER MIDDLE EAST, NOT

58
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,166
DIRECTLY AGAINST ISRAEL BUT

59
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,467
OTHER WESTERN INTERESTS.

60
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,036
COULD BE IN SOME OTHER PART OF

61
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:12,637
THE WORLD OR RIGHT THERE IN THE

62
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:14,873
LEBANON WESTERN SYRIA THEATER.

63
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:16,274
THEY'LL DO SOMETHING.

64
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:18,777
THE QUESTION IS, DO THEY VIEW

65
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:20,912
THEIR POSITION AS BEING

66
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:22,180
RELATIVELY STRENGTHENED ANYWAY

67
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,015
BECAUSE ASSAD HAS LARGELY WON

68
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:26,117
THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR AND THEY

69
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:28,954
CAN TAKE A HIT BUT STILL BE IN A

70
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:30,355
BETTER PLACE THAN THEY HAD BEEN

71
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:31,857
OR DO THEY FEEL THE NEED TO

72
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:34,960
PURSUE AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A

73
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,994
TOOTH FOR THE TOOTH.

74
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:36,828
KNOWING THE MIDDLE EAST, MY

75
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,964
MONEY IS ON THE LATTER.

76
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:40,198
>> Shepard: THIS HAS BEEN A

77
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:42,234
PROXY WAR ONGOING A LONG TIME.

78
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:43,935
JOHN BOLTON HAS SAID FOR MANY

79
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,238
YEARS THAT THIS IS -- THERE WILL

80
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:47,405
BE WAR IN IRAN.

81
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,174
ONE OF MANY OF THE SOUND BITES

82
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:51,343
THAT WE CAN PULL FROM HIM.

83
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:52,377
LISTEN TO THIS ONE.

84
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,079
>> THE BEHAVIOR AND THE

85
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,413
OBJECTIVES OF THE REGIME ARE NOT

86
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:57,048
GOING TO CHANGE.

87
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:58,416
THEREFORE, THE ONLY SOLUTION IS

88
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:06,024
TO CHANGE THE REGIME ITSELF.

89
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:10,762
THAT IS WHY BEFORE 2019 WE HERE

90
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:13,665
WILL CELEBRATE IN TEHRAN.

91
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:15,400
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

92
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,035
>> Shepard: WE WILL CELEBRATE IN

93
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:18,436
TEHRAN BEFORE 2019 THAT WOULD

94
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:22,807
MARK 40 YEARS SINCE THE IRANIAN

95
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:23,208
REVOLUTION.

96
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,677
IS IT THE POLICY OF THE UNITED

97
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,078
STATES FOR REGIME CHANGE IN

98
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:27,379
IRAN?

99
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,980
IT SOUNDED LIKE IT THERE.

100
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,949
>> IT DID SOUND LIKE IT,

101
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:31,283
SHEPARD.

102
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:32,117
I DON'T KNOW THINK WHAT JOHN

103
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:34,619
BOLTON SAID WAS REALISTIC.

104
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:37,522
I SYMPATHIZE WHERE HE'S COMING

105
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:37,822
FROM.

106
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:39,658
IT'S EASY TO SAY BEFORE YOU'RE

107
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:41,092
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND

108
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:42,560
EASIER TO SAY AND DO NO MATTER

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,696
WHERE AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING.

110
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:48,500
IF YOU WANT TO REDEFINE REGIME

111
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,202
CHANGE, INCENTIVIZING FUTURE

112
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:54,139
LEADERS IN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC

113
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:56,741
TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY, AND YOU

114
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,310
CAN CALL THAT REGIME CHANGE.

115
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,178
WHAT KIM JONG-UN IS DOING IS

116
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:00,645
REGIME CHARGE.

117
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:02,314
HE'S TRYING TO TURN INTO A

118
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:02,948
CHARMING GUY.

119
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:03,982
I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER

120
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:05,383
HE'S CHANGED AND I HAVE MY

121
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:07,085
DOUBTS ABOUT THE IRAN SCENARIO.

122
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:08,653
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE DON'T

123
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:11,589
HAVE THE ABILITY IN A COUNTRY OF

124
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:15,060
100 MILLION PEOPLE TO GO IN AND

125
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,927
CREATE REGIME CHANGE.

126
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:17,028
WE CAN SQUEEZE THEM.

127
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,997
THAT WILL HAVE SOME IMPACT.

128
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,298
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WILL BE

129
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:20,632
ENOUGH.

130
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:21,833
THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE THEIR

131
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,937
REGIME IN THE LAST FEW YEARS

132
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:27,439
SO I'M SKEPTICAL ABOUT

133
00:04:27,439 --> 00:00:00,000
MR. BOLTON'S IMPLICATION, EVEN
