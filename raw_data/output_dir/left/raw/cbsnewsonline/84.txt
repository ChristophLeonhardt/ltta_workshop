SPANISH LANGUAGE INTERPRETER IS 

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:04,337
IN THE COURTROOM. 

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,306
IN ADDITION AT THE DEFENSE 

4
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,774
TABLE IS A PRIVATELY RETAINED 

5
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:12,345
INTERPRETER TO BE USED FOR

CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE 

7
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:17,517
DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND HIS 

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:17,750
CLIENT. 

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,252
MR.RIVERA, ARE YOU ABLE TO 

10
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:19,686
UNDERSTAND TODAY'S 

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,253
UNDERSTANDINGS THROUGH THE 

12
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,722
INTERPRETER?       

13
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:30,463
>> YES.        

14
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,166
>> THE DEFENSE HAS FILED A 

15
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,934
MOTION FOR A PRIVATE HEARING. 

16
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:38,838
THE DEFENSE HAS ALSO FILED A 

17
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,941
RESISTANCE TO THE USE OF THE 

18
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,374
EXPANDED MEDIA. 

19
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:45,311
WE'LL HEAR ARGUMENTS ON THAT 

20
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:45,644
MOTION FIRST. 

21
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:48,948
MR.RICHARDS--   

22
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,251
>> IF IT MAY PLEASE THE COURT, 

23
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:56,055
MR. PROSECUTOR, I PULLED A CASE 

24
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:56,622
LAW THIS MORNING FROM IOWA 

25
00:00:56,622 --> 00:01:03,363
COURT OF APPEALS.       

26
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:12,205
AND IT'S STATE VERSUS JACK 

27
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,839
HAYES, OCTOBER 3, 2012. 

28
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:14,841
AND IT'S NUMBER 2-701-11-0669. 

29
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,744
AND THERE'S A PIECE IN THAT 

30
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,446
CASE THAT TALKS ABOUT EXPANDED 

31
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:22,414
MEDIA COVERAGE. 

32
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:23,116
AND THIS PARTICULAR COURT THERE 

33
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:28,387
GRANTED THE EXPANDED COVERAGE.  

34
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:30,590
>> BUT THE SUPREME COURT 

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,859
CONCLUDED IT'S WITHIN THE 

36
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,295
DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE TO 

37
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,199
EXCLUDE THE EXPANDED MEDIA 

38
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,967
COVERAGE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES 

39
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,368
OF THE PARTICULAR PROCEEDINGS. 

40
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:42,968
SUCH COVERAGE WOULD INTERFERE 

41
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:45,138
WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES 

42
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:51,510
FOR A FAIR TRIAL. 

43
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,346
AND IT'S BASED ON 

44
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,180
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. 

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,548
ESSENTIALLY, THE PREJUDICE HERE 

46
00:01:55,548 --> 00:02:01,955
IS THE DECISION BEFOREHAND TO 

47
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,491
LEAN IN FAVOR OF ONE SIDE OR 

48
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:08,261
THE OTHER WHICH PREVENTS 

49
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,294
JUSTICE. 

50
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,295
THE COVERAGE THAT'S OUT THERE 

51
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,564
IS LEANING ALL ONE WAY. 

52
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,602
IN FACT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS 

53
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,870
WEIGHED IN AT THE HIGHEST 

54
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,573
LEVELS OF A PREDISPOSITION THAT 

55
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:24,310
THIS YOUNG MAN IS GUILTY. 

56
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,945
BUT IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE, 

57
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,981
HE'S ENTITLED TO THAT 

58
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,048
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE UNTIL 

59
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:32,185
SOME EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED. 

60
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,754
AT THIS TIME THERE'S BEEN NO 

61
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,587
EVIDENCE PRESENTS, YOUR HONOR. 

62
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:39,525
AND WE'RE URGING THE COURT TO 

63
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,926
PREVENT THE CAMERAS FROM COMING 

64
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:44,697
IN HERE WHICH COULD SHOW BIAS 

65
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:49,102
OR PREJUDICE AND GET IT INTO 

66
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,203
THIS POLITICAL CONTROVERSY OF 

67
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,971
PORTRAYING HIM AS SOMETHING 

68
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:52,805
THAT HE ISN'T. 

69
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:56,576
IN SOME WAYS I VIEW THIS AS A 

70
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,777
POLITICAL PAYBACK FOR WHAT'S 

71
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,845
SWIRLING AROUND IN TERMS OF THE 

72
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:00,179
MEDIA. 

73
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,981
AND THE MEDIA IS FEEDING INTO 

74
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:02,348
IT. 

75
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,285
THEY HAVE NOT MADE EFFORTS AS 

76
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,988
FAR AS I CAN SEE TO GIVE 

77
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:13,225
JUSTICE FOR ANY TYPE OF LEANING 

78
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:16,595
TOWARDS THIS PRESUMPTION OF 

79
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:16,896
INNOCENCE. 

80
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:23,503
AND THERE ARE WE'RE ASKING THIS 

81
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,271
COURT TO EXCLUDE THE MEDIA FROM 

82
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,605
THE PROCEEDINGS. 

83
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:30,042
IT COULD BE ONE NOD OF THE 

84
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,544
HEAD, ONE GLANCE, ONE SLIGHT OF 

85
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,780
HAND THAT WILL BE TAKEN OUT OF 

86
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,983
CONTEXT AND PRESENTED OVER AND 

87
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:40,787
OVER WHICH WOULD BE HYLE 

88
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,787
PREJUDICIAL TO THE DEFENDANT. 

89
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:44,023
I URGE THE COURT TO EXCLUDE THE 

90
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,424
COURT FROM THE PROCEEDINGS. 

91
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:46,592
>> THANK YOU. 

92
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:49,195
MR.BROWN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO 

93
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:49,962
MAKE AN ARGUMENT? 

94
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:53,099
>> YES, JUDGE, THE STATE HAS NO 

95
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,202
OBJECTION TO THE EXPANDED MEDIA 

96
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:56,602
REQUEST. 

97
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:59,906
I THINK THEY FOLLOWED PROPER 

98
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,206
PROCEDURE. 

99
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,475
MR-- IS THE REGIONAL MEDIA 

100
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:02,975
COORDINATOR. 

101
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,310
IT'S VERY ROUTINE IN CASES THAT 

102
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,079
GARNER SOME SORT OF HIGH 

103
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,483
PROFILE THAT THE MEDIA HAS 

104
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:10,783
INTEREST. 

105
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,685
THE SUPREME COURT HAS PROVIDED 

106
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:17,290
RULE FOR THE COURT TO FOLLOW IN 

107
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,224
ALLOWING MEDIA COVERAGE OF 

108
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,858
CASES AND COURT PROCEEDINGS. 

109
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,228
WE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO 

110
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:22,895
THE EXPANDED MEDIA REQUEST. 

111
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:29,435
THERE'S BEEN A REQUEST FOR A 

112
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:34,340
VIDEO CAMERA AND A STILL CAMERA 

113
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,876
WHICH IS USUAL UNDER THE 

114
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,243
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

115
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:41,214
SO WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE 

116
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,516
MEDIA -- EXPANDED MEDIA REQUEST 

117
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,817
IN THIS CASE. 

118
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,886
I WOULD ASSUME ONCE THE CASE -- 

119
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,989
WHOEVER THE DISTRICT COURT 

120
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,626
JUDGE IS THAT ASSIGNS THE CASE 

121
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,661
WILL PROBABLY READDRESS THAT 

122
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:55,894
ISSUE. 

123
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,230
SECONDLY, THERE'S BEEN A MOTION 

124
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,463
FILED. 

125
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,533
I JUST GOT THIS WHEN I WALKED 

126
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,033
IN THIS AFTERNOON. 

127
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,569
A MOTION FOR PRIVATE HEARING 

128
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,339
PRUDENT TO IOWA RULE OF 

129
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,207
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 2.24. 

130
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:08,975
I THINK THAT'S WHAT MR. 

131
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,410
RICHARDS HERE WAS REFERENCING  

132
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,512
WHEN HE WAS ARGUING THAT 

133
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,913
THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL 

134
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:14,514
PROBABILITY THAT THE 

135
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:19,619
DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO A FAIR 

136
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,021
TRIAL WILL BE PREJUDICED BY THE 

137
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,457
PUBLICITY AND THE CLOSURE OF 

138
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,091
THIS PROCEEDING WOULD PREVENT. 

139
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,059
HE HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ANYTHING 

140
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:29,762
THAT WOULD HAPPEN TODAY IN THIS 

141
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,330
PARTICULAR HEARING THAT WOULD 

142
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,765
CREATE ANY TYPE OF SUBSTANTIAL 

143
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,034
PROBABILITY THAT HIS FAIR TRIAL 

144
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,101
WOULD BE IMPACTED. 

145
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,104
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT  

146
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:38,804
WHATEVER THE POLITICAL 

147
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,406
DISCOURSE IS THAT'S BEEN 

148
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,109
SURROUNDING THE CHARGE OF THIS 

149
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:43,509
CASE. 

150
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,177
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THAT. 

151
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,312
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS AT THIS 

152
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:46,545
POINT. 

153
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,114
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION 

154
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,582
THAT IS OUT THERE ABOUT THE 

155
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:51,484
CASE AND THIS PARTICULAR 

156
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:51,717
CHARGE. 

157
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:54,220
I THINK ALL THE COURT IS GOING 

158
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,724
TO DO IS FOLLOW RULE 2.2 IN THE 

159
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:00,460
INITIAL APPEARANCE ADVISING HIM 

160
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,829
OF HIS RIGHTS, MAKING SURE HE'S 

161
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,363
GOT COUNSEL THAT HE'S EITHER 

162
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,631
RETAINED OR APPOINTED AND 

163
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,265
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF A 

164
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,733
PRELIMINARY HEARING AND WHETHER 

165
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:12,004
OR NOT HE DEMANDS THAT. 

166
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,406
I FAIL TO SEE HOW ANY 

167
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,374
SUBSTANTIAL PROBABILITY OF -- 

168
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,443
THE IMPACT ON THE DEFENDANTS 

169
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,413
FAIR TRIAL WOULD BE RAISED IN 

170
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,580
THIS PARTICULAR PROCEEDING. 

171
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,017
SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE MOTION 

172
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,321
FOR ARRIVE HEARING BE DENIED 

173
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,457
AND THE EXPANDED MEDIA REQUEST 

174
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,924
BE GRANTED. 

175
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:36,062
>> IF I MAY RESPOND, YOUR 

176
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,963
HONOR. 

177
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:37,263
>> BRIEFLY. 

178
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,630
>> PROCEDURES WEREN'T FOLLOWED. 

179
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,067
I ENTERED MY APPEARANCE THIS 

180
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,269
MORNING, ATTEMPTED TO SHORTLY 

181
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,069
AFTER 8 A.M. 

182
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,806
THE E-FILE SYSTEM WAS DOWN OR 

183
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,139
CRASHED. 

184
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,344
I DID NOT SEE THE MOTION FOR 

185
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,413
EXPANDED MEDIA COVERAGE UNTIL 

186
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,147
12:00 TODAY. 

187
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,750

188
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,218
YESTERDAY, CHRISTIAN WAS STILL 

189
00:06:59,218 --> 00:06:59,618

ALTHOUGH I DO ACKNOWLEDGE I SAW 

194
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,896
IT AT 12:00 TODAY. 

195
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,998
MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT THE E-

196
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:15,601

197
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,470

198
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:17,670

199
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,304
AND THE PROSECUTOR SAYS THE 

200
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:19,771
RULES WERE FOLLOWED. 

201
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:25,344
THEY WERE NOT FOLLOWED.     

202
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,046
>> MR. RICHARDS, I'M AWARE OF 

203
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,549
THE FACT THAT WE HAD TECHNICAL 

204
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,250
DIFFICULTIES WITH THE E-FILING 

205
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,852
SYSTEM THAT THE IOWA JUDICIAL 

206
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:33,352
SYSTEM USES. 

207
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,755
BECAUSE I WAS AWARE OF THAT I 

208
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,456
MADE CONTACT WITH BOTH YOU AND 

209
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:41,294
MR. BROWN, NOTIFIED EACH OF YOU 

210
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,161
OF THE EXPANDED MEDIA COVERAGE 

211
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,297
FIRST THING THIS MORNING, 

212
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,798
EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTIES WE 

213
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,600

214
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,300
COPIES AVAILABLE TO YOU. 

215
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,870
AND SAID AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVED 

216
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,673
AT THE COURTHOUSE WE WOULD MAKE 

217
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,375
EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TO YOU IF 

218
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,276
EDMS WAS NOT AVAILABLE. 

219
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,978
I BELIEVE WE'VE FOLLOWED THE 

220
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,045
PROCEDURES AVAILABLE TO US. 

221
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:02,582
AND WE HAVE GONE OUT OF OUR WAY 

222
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,584
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE WE WERE 

223
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,885

224
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,186
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE WERE 

225
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,789
MAKING YOU AWARE OF THINGS 

226
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:10,189

227
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,225
AND WE ALLOWED YOU TO FILE AN 

228
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,194
EARLY APPEARANCE BY FAX WHICH 

229
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,495
WOULD NOT BE A NORMAL 

230
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:16,795
PROCEDURE. 

231
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,798
SO YOU DID TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 

232
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,465
THE FACT THAT THE COURT WAS 

233
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:23,402

234
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,103
ACCOMMODATE FOR THE TECHNICAL 

235
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,237
DIFFICULTIES WE'RE HAVING. 

236
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,173
AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO RULE

WITH A REMINDER TO EVERYONE 

241
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,687
