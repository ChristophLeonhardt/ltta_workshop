the idea that there's a correlation between the sex drive and success makes so much sense to me and I can't even believe honestly that there's a lot of questions about that the same things that we're looking at for people who we in our 21st century heads think are successful are you know when you look at either our politicians or the CEO of companies they're generally people who are very confident very driven narcissistic but often just also very charming and people who can engage people those are things that we look for and then we don't understand why those are the same people who are off having million affairs right like when we think about President Clinton we loved him as a community we did because he was so engaging and charming and he brought all of us in and he needed to be loved and admired and have sexual conquests and that often is a package deal so that's from kind of a psychological perspective I think from a physiological perspective and I feel like those always go together high levels of testosterone really do make people more aggressive more confident and have higher sex drives but for us understand that testosterone is a driving force and it's a driving force for what we call strength and leadership aggression and also for what we'd call a sex drive and so it's very common that those two things live together and it's not at all surprising to me if all the studies seem to suggest that people who are very successful business also have very high sex drives
