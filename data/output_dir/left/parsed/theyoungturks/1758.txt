IT'S MAY
1, A.K.A.
INTERNATIONAL WORKERS
DAY, ALL OVER THE WORLD PEOPLE
ARE PROTESTING FOR WORKERS'
RIGHTS.
THESE ARE PHOTOS FROM
NEW YORK.
AN ORGANIZER OF ONE OF
THE EVENTS IN NEW YORK SAID --
THIS IS ACCORDING TO AN
ADVOCACY GROUP.
IN RECENT YEARS
THERE HAS BEEN A MARRIAGE OF
MAYDAY AND IMMIGRANT GROUPS FOR
THEM TO WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE
CHANGE, ONE OF THE FOCUS IS ON
THE ELECTION, YOU SEE ARCHES
FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND THE
UNITED STATES, AND TRYING TO
FOCUS ON MAKING AN ELECTORAL
DIFFERENCE.
THIS IS FROM
ANGELICA SALAS IN LOS ANGELES
WHO SAID --
ESSENTIALLY SAYING WE NEED TO
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN EVERY
ELECTION THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN
NOW AND FOREVER TO GET THE KIND
OF CHANGE WE WANT.
REACTIONS TO
THE INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY
SITUATION?
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU
KNOW ABOUT MAYDAY AND ITS
ORIGINS BUT IT'S REALLY
INTERESTING BECAUSE MAYDAY
STARTED HERE IN THE U.S., IN
CHICAGO, IN 1886.
BUT IT'S NO
LONGER CELEBRATED HERE, AND IN
FACT I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A
VERY PURPOSEFUL AND INTENTIONAL
EFFORT TO WIPE IT FROM OUR
HISTORY.
IT'S CELEBRATED
WORLDWIDE, IT'S WHERE WORKERS
GATHER AND CELEBRATE THE
IMPORTANCE OF WORKERS' RIGHTS.
SO IN 1886 IN CHICAGO AT
HAYMARKET THERE WAS A
DEMONSTRATION, THAT THEY I
BELIEVE THERE WERE 300,000
WORKERS NATIONWIDE THAT WENT ON
STRIKE.
IT STARTED THERE AND A
WOMAN NAMED LUCY PARSONS WAS THE
LEADER OF IT, SHE WAS A FORMER
SLAVE, SHE WAS ALSO PART
MEXICAN-AMERICAN, PART
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, AND SHE GOT
FOLKS TO COME TOGETHER AS
WORKERS ACROSS RACIAL LINES.
AND
THAT'S VERY THREATENING TO THE
POWER STRUCTURE.
SO COPS, LIKE
THEY DID AGAINST OCCUPY, THEY
BROKE THAT PROTEST, AND THEN A
COUPLE DAYS LATER THEY CAME BACK
IN THE SPIRIT OF, WELL, YOU MAY
HAVE KILLED SOME OF US BUT WE
AREN'T GOING TO GO AWAY.
THE
WORKERS GATHERED AGAIN WITH THE
MAYOR OF CHICAGO, AND IT WAS A
PEACEFUL PROTEST, AND COPS AGAIN
CAME AND SOMEONE THREW A BOMB,
THE COPS FIRED INDISCRIMINATELY
INTO THE CROWD, A BUNCH OF
PEOPLE DIED, AND SEVEN PEOPLE
WERE CHARGED WITH ALL KINDS OF
CRIMES IN RELATION TO THAT
INCIDENT.
FOUR WERE HANGED,
THREE WERE LATER PARDONED
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WEREN'T
EVEN PHYSICALLY THERE -- ANYWAY
THE WHOLE THING WAS A DISASTER,
BUT IN AN EFFORT TO WIPE MAYDAY
FROM OUR HISTORY BOOKS IN THE
U.S. IT WAS CHANGED TO LABOR DAY
IN SEPTEMBER TO KIND OF
DISCONNECT FROM MAYDAY.
AND 70
YEARS LATER IT WAS STILL ON THE
MINDS OF PEOPLE BECAUSE
EISENHOWER TRIED TO CHANGE
MAYDAY INTO NATIONAL LAW AND
ORDER DAY, MAY 1, WHICH SOUNDS
NOT FUN AT ALL.
NOW YOU COULD JUST GET
TOGETHER AND WATCH A LOT OF LAW
& ORDER.
IT GIVES IT A WHOLE DIFFERENT
MEANING.
SO THAT'S MAYDAY, AND TODAY
THERE ARE CELEBRATIONS AND
COMMEMORATIONS ALL OVER THE
WORLD, BUT IN THE U.S. IT'S
LARGELY FORGOTTEN.
WE SHOULD LEARN ABOUT LUCY
PARSONS AND MAYDAY IN OUR
HISTORY BOOKS.
WE JUST DID, STEVE OH, THANKS
TO YOU.
I FELT LIKE YOU WERE THE
RACHEL MADDOW OF THE SHOW.
WE HAVE THE SAME HAIRCUT.
GOOD FOR YOU.
DIRECT YOUR
TWEETS TO STEVE OH ABOUT
APPEARANCE, AND I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
ANYWAY,
PUERTO RICO, IN PUERTO RICO IT
WAS KIND OF REMINISCENT OF THE
VIOLENCE YOU KIND OF MENTIONED
--
THEY HAVE A GROUP WHICH IS A
PLAY ON THE PROMISE THAT WAS,
LIKE, THE BAILOUT DEAL MADE WITH
PUERTO RICO AND HAS ESSENTIALLY
BEEN RENEGED ON IN THE EYES OF
THE LABOR MOVEMENT THERE.
THEY
SAY, ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG --
BUT IT SEEMS THAT WITH THIS
NEW -- THERE'S A FEDERAL PANEL
THAT'S SAYING, LISTEN, WE WILL
HELP YOU OUT AND BAIL YOU OUT
FROM YOUR DEBT AS LONG AS WE
KIND OF ESSENTIALLY DISMANTLE
YOUR PENSION PROGRAMS.
WHICH IS
JUST UTTERLY UNFAIR, AND HAS TO
BE VERY FRUSTRATING IF YOU SPENT
YEARS AND YEARS WORKING AS A
PUBLIC EMPLOYEE, AND IT SEEMS
LIKE IT'S ALL KIND OF GOING
AWAY.
