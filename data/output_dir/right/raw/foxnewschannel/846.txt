1
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,066
HOWIE: THERE IS NO QUESTION KIM

2
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:12,968
JONG-UN IS A BRUTAL RULER.

3
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:15,403
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DETRACTORS IN

4
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:18,006
THE MEDIA WERE QUICK TO

5
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:22,544
CRITICIZE THE PRAISE HE HAD FOR

6
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:23,445
THE DICTATOR.

7
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:25,547
PRESIDENT TRUMP: HE'S GOT A VERY

8
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:26,748
GOOD PERSONALITY.

9
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:29,050
HE'S FUN CRANE VERY VERY SMART.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,586
HE'S A GREAT NEGOTIATOR.

11
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:34,956
HE HAS A GREAT PERSONALITY, A

12
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:35,824
VERY SMART GUY.

13
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:39,928
HE LOVES HIS PEOPLE.

14
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:43,665
HOWIE: SEVERAL JOURNALISTS

15
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:46,167
PRESSING HIM INCLUDING BRET

16
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:46,468
BAIER.

17
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:49,104
BRET: YOU CALL PEOPLE SOMETIMES

18
00:00:49,104 --> 00:00:49,871
KILLERS.

19
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,439
HE IS A KILLER.

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,575
PRESIDENT TRUMP: HE HAS DONE

21
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,544
SOME REALLY BAD THINGS.

22
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:57,012
PRESIDENT TRUMP: BUT SO HAVE

23
00:00:57,012 --> 00:01:01,650
OTHER PEOPLE DONE SOME VERY BAD

24
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:01,983
THINGS.

25
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:04,185
HOWIE: SOME PEOPLE ON THE LEFT

26
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:07,222
ARE UPSET THAT HE MET WITH THIS

27
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:07,689
GUY.

28
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:10,759
MOLLIE: IT'S HARD TO HEAR THE

29
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:11,760
PRESIDENT PRAISE SOMEBODY LIKE

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,527
THIS.

31
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,629
BUT IT'S WORTH KEEPING IT IN

32
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:15,063
CONTEXT.

33
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:16,865
WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WAS

34
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:19,601
BASHING KIM A YEAR AGO WHEN HE

35
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:23,171
WAS IN SEOUL WHEN HE GAVE THE

36
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:26,174
SPEECH THAT TOOK HIM DOWN A

37
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,509
NOTCH.

38
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,177
FLATTERY IS A TOOL WHEN DEALING

39
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:31,980
WITH SOMETHING LIKE NUCLEAR

40
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,647
DISARMAMENT.

41
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,649
EVEN IF THAT REQUIRE SOS

42
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:38,420
FLATTERY OF A DICTATOR RATHER

43
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,956
THAN MAKE THIS THE TIME TO TALK

44
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:43,391
ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

45
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:49,564
HOWIE: PRESIDENT OBAMA WASN'T

46
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:50,899
CRITICIZED FOR HIS RELATIONSHIP

47
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:53,201
WITH CUBA.

48
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,736
MARIE: THE RELATIONSHIP CANS IN

49
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:59,774
THE PRESS WERE CRITICAL OF THE

50
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:01,176
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DURING THE

51
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,243
IRAN NEGOTIATION.

52
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:04,346
SOME OF THOSE SAME COMMENTATORS

53
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:07,048
ARE NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT

54
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:07,616
DONALD TRUMP.

55
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:11,019
HOWIE: IT SOUNDS LIKE TO IS

56
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,255
HYPOCRISY ON BOTH SIDES.

57
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:17,926
MARIE: HIS LANGUAGE WAS SO

58
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:19,761
EXTREME, LITTLE ROCKETMAN, FIRE

59
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,429
AND FURY.

60
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:23,098
FLATTERY CAN BE PART OF

61
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:23,565
DIPLOMACY.

62
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:30,872
BUT IT'S SO STRIKING, ESPECIALLY

63
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:31,573
ALLIES.

64
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:34,943
HOWIE: AREN'T THERE LOTS OF

65
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:39,781
LEGITIMATE CRITICISM BEING MADE.

66
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:43,251
ALL TO BE NEGOTIATED, THE

67
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:53,061
PRESIDENT DIDN'T GET MUCH OF A

68
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:53,361
TURN.

69
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:56,097
>> I THINK THE QUESTION

70
00:02:56,097 --> 00:02:59,300
JOURNALISTS ARE ASKING IS WORTH

71
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,668
DIPLOMACY.

72
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:02,203
HOWIE: HAVING A MEETING NO OTHER

73
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:05,840
PRESIDENT HAS TALKED TO IS

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,608
DIPLOMATIC.

75
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:10,278
SARA: IT SAYS THEY ARE GOING TO

76
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:10,712
DENUCLEARIZE.

77
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:12,180
THAT WAS NOT POINT OF THIS.

78
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,152
IT WAS TO GET NORTH KOREA TOP

79
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:17,585
DENUCLEARIZE.

80
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,287
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS

81
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,088
THE FIRST STEP.

82
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,923
SOME OF THIS CRITICISM COMES

83
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,925
FROM THE RIGHT.

84
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:27,162
BLOGGER ERIC ERICKSON WROTE THAT

85
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:30,465
TRUMP AN TAGNIZED THE G-7 THEN

86
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:34,302
MADE KISSY FACE WITH KIM

87
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:34,836
JONG-UN.

88
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:37,005
IF OBAMA HAD DONE THAT THE

89
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,907
REPUBLICANS WOULD BE DEMANDING

90
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:41,409
HIS IMPEACHMENT.

91
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:46,815
MOLLIE: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

92
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,283
THE INTERVENTIONIST TYPE AND

93
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:50,051
THOSE TIRED OF THAT APPROACH TO

94
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,852
FOREIGN POLICY.

95
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:54,089
YOU SAW PEOPLE CRITICIZE OBAMA

96
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:56,591
MEETING WITH CASTRO.

97
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,893
THERE IS ANOTHER STREAM THAT

98
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:00,361
DOESN'T GET A LOT OF COVERAGE

99
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,764
WHICH IS A MORE REALIST APPROACH

100
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:05,567
TO FOREIGN POLICY.

101
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,969
ONE THING ABOUT THE MEDIA'S

102
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:09,337
CRITICISM OF THE PRAISE OF KIM.

103
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:12,907
IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO

104
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:14,909
BELIEVE THEY WERE GENUINE IF

105
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,012
THEY HADN'T SPENT THE OLYMPIC

106
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:21,716
PRAISING THE SISTER OF KIM.

107
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:24,452
HOWIE: SOME OF THE PRESIDENT WAS

108
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:25,453
JUST PERSONAL.

109
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:31,793
TRUMP WAS INCOHERENT, TRUMP WAS

110
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:32,093
NAIVE.

111
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:32,660
TRUMP WAS HOODWINKED.

112
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,464
IT JUST REMINDS ME HOW VISCERAL

113
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:38,500
SOME OF THE COMMENTS ARE.

114
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,537
MARIE: WE HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT

115
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:42,971
COMMENTATORS.

116
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,606
YOU CAN CRITICIZE THE STATEMENT

117
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:46,608
FOR BEING VAGUE, SHORT ON

118
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:47,275
SPECIFICS.

119
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:49,410
WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET

120
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,613
INTO PERSONAL ATTACKS.

121
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:53,181
DONALD TRUMP MAKES SO MUCH OF

122
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:56,351
HIS ATTACKS AND COMMENTARY VERY

123
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:56,718
PERSONAL.

124
00:04:56,718 --> 00:05:00,922
WE ARE LIVING IN THIS AGE WHERE

125
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:03,124
HIS LANGUAGE FEELS SO PERSONAL.

126
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:07,428
WE IN THE MEDIA HAVE TO MAKE

127
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,631
SURE WE ARE FOCUSING ON

128
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:10,165
SUBSTANCE.

129
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:12,867
>> DOES THE MEDIA FALL INTO THE

130
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:17,071
TRAP OF USING EXTREME TERMS.

131
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:21,042
>> WE NEED TO MAKE SURE.

132
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:24,779
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE SAW A

133
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,083
LOT IN THE WAY THE PRESIDENT WAS

134
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,152
HANDLING DIPLOMACY.

135
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:33,121
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT HAD A LIGHT

136
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:35,757
MOMENT IN WHICH HE WAS TALKING

137
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:36,624
ABOUT KIM JONG-UN.

138
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:40,028
>> HE'S THE STRONG MAN.

139
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:42,230
HE SPEAKS AND HIS PEOPLE SIT UP

140
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,764
AT ATTENTION.

141
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:47,735
I WANT MY PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME.

142
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:51,639
HOWIE: THAT WAS A JOKE, YET IT

143
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,141
BECAME THE LEAD IN THE

144
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:54,442
"WASHINGTON POST."

145
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:57,512
HE WAS NOT SERIOUS.

146
00:05:57,512 --> 00:00:00,000
LET'S -- THERE HE SAYS A LOT OF
