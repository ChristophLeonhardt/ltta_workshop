Donald Trump was at a rally in South Carolina in order to support Republican Governor Henry McMaster and of course it drew a pretty large crowd and the media wanted to cover it among those in the media who covered the event were Jim Acosta working for CNN and there was a lot of harassment geared toward Jim Acosta as he was at that event some of those videos were posted online and I want to share one of them with you right now take a look every right to be here all right so if you can't tell she's yelling take him out take him out well there are no good connotations to that at best it's a awkward thing to say that she shouldn't be saying but one is take him out of the building because we don't want press in the building well then Donald Trump would complain that there aren't pressing the building first of all let's keep it real but second of all it's got huge problems obviously for our former government where we believe in freedom of the press but by the way you could have be interpreted in the worst possible way take him out sorry right and and so it wasn't just that woman she just happened to be the one I guess caught on tape and apparently at one point Jim Acosta attempted to shake her hand and tell her you know that he respected the United States and the woman like waved her hands and you know at him and basically said no you don't and what stood out to me the most not just about this particular case but all of the hatred geared towards CNN by Donald Trump and his supporters is that CNN isn't even really I mean CNN goes out of its way to be neutral I think CNN will have the most incompetent nonsensical Trump supporters on every panel just to prove that they're willing to provide a platform for the other side and oftentimes their anchors are unwilling to fact-check the people that come on so it's just interesting to me that Trump has really like decided to cling on to his hatred for CNN he keeps saying fake news he keeps referring to them as the opposition and his supporters just go along with it and and I want CNN to kind of learn a lesson from that doesn't matter what you do to appear objective right if you do this false equivalency thing you're losing in every way you're not gonna get Trump supporters to like your shows you're not gonna get them to respect the network you're still gonna get harassed by them at these rallies and you're gonna do a disservice to the American people by doing a crappy job in journalism yeah so I'm gonna go in a couple different directions here first off I don't mind booing CNN at rallies and but there are things that Anna's saying that I totally agree with so first of all though look look at what CNN does now they got burned and I'll tell you what my role in it now and I don't mind it one bit and I'll do it again okay I have attacked the mainstream media including CNN at Bernie Sanders rallies and the crowd booed them and I was delighted okay now in response to the Republicans they pack all their panels with Trump supporters and 50% Republicans in response to Bernie Sanders supporters they put almost no one on CNN that was a Bernie Sanders supporter well I'm so yeah you could push him around if you're the right-wing and they'll say thank you sir may I have another if you're a progressive they'll say we don't care about you and I mean what they'll call you get called liberal they're not liberal they're not remotely libel so can I actually give you a specific example so back in the day this was before the general election during election season brian Stelter and his producers invited me on to Todd I went on as the progressive as the Bernie Sanders supporter and the person representing the right wing was Scottie Nell Hughes now that clip went viral right because I happen to be strong and I happen to fight back against Scottie Nell Hughes without you know cowering like most people that they choose to represent liberals right and I never got called back on again on at least not on brian Stelter show right and and they don't like it they don't like strong progressives who speak their mind and who actually challenged the nonsense that comes out of these conservative panelists and in Trump the Republicans even well before Trump got CNN's of the world to believe that they actually are liberal when in fact they're run by a giant multi-billion dollar corporation who does not want any change to the status quo by the way including Donald Trump but they said they want Bernie Sanders even less they have great disdain for progressives and everyone smile they'll say I mean Van Jones is a real progressive how about you 150 other anchors and people on there they almost all voted for Hillary Clinton but what bias bias no no we're not by soe I don't mind booing CNN but there's a giant difference between us and the right-wing so and maybe that's why they respect them and they and they treat progresses with disdain which is ironic and sends all the wrong incentives number one we believe in freedom of the press and we don't think they should be driven from the building but if we're gonna but there's nothing wrong with engaging in a debate about that number two it depends on the person right so I think Jim Acosta is actually a very good reporter so and there are other people at CNN and Allison camerota and others that I highly respect and I think do a wonderful job right but overall the organization doesn't realize how enormous Lea biased it is against the left-wing and so yeah I will boo that yeah no question about it overall for the organization and but to me the most important part is when Trump says to that crowd and as he did again this time he said the enemy the enemy of the people I call them now that is over the top that that encourages bad behavior it's one thing to say that they are bias is one thing to say they are not covering things fairly and that is totally within fair game okay but to say they are the enemy of the people right so that is inciting violence and it's a terrible idea so so I'm actually very mixed on this story because while I do believe that it's important for American citizens to look at our media and criticize it critique it and demand more from our journalists you have to also understand the context in which this whole you know issue came up this is a symptom of a huge issue that I think Americans in general should have a problem with we are living in what's supposed to be a democratic system I see it quickly deteriorating one of the most important aspects of maintaining a democracy is ensuring that we have free press and that we don't rely on the state to determine the type of news that we should be watching and what Trump is doing every single day little by little is pushing for state-sponsored media state-sponsored media that is very very favorable to him that's very complementary to him anything that are any outlet that has the audacity to ever criticize him or speak truth to power is fake news that is a very dangerous message to send to Americans and people are eating it up and so I would feel the same way if it was a Democratic president that I voted for I would be disgusted to see him you know treat the media the way Donald Trump is treated the media that has been critical of him yeah well I hear you we definitely have a shade of difference here Anna because I think that inciting the violence and the over in trying it like Brad Pascrell who's now the the campaign manager for the non-existent 20:28 Donald Trump campaign which likely will never happen because I hope so right okay anyway so he's their campaign manager he says take away Jimmy Costas press credentials well that's a direct violation of the Constitution so if a democratic president attacked the press and by the way Obama calling whistleblowers enemies of the state in a sense also did that and we went ballistic on that and said that was definitely wrong we have been consistent on it from day one okay we protect the press and we and we value the Constitution on the other hand I want a Democratic president attacking the press because they are deeply NT progressive hold on hold on look it depends on the context obviously right so if we're dealing with press that does fabricate stories because they are clearly against the president for whatever reason then yes but in the in the case of Donald Trump the media is not fabricating stories it's just not right they might make mistakes as journalists do and then they promptly correct their mistakes which is a responsible thing to do but then what does Donald Trump do he'll latch on to that as as proof that it's fake news but no journalists have made mistakes since journalism has existed the responsible thing to do is correct yourself I think that if a president is attempting to dismantle media and push for state-sponsored media because he wants complementary favorable coverage of himself then that's a problem whether it's a democrat or republican we agree on that and so like the other day ABC made a mistake about a cairo ago you know the guy made a mistake they made a mistake and they immediately corrected it unlike the right-wing that never corrects anything are you Naruto strongly denied even in that same rally and that'll trump the pathological liar again made up a story about how he called Jimmy Jimmy Fallon called him to thank him for his monster ratings and Jimmy found like I don't even have his phone number one side is a bunch of pathological liars and the other side is trying to do their job I think they do oftentimes do a terrible job then they'll go and call it even Trump says this file says this golly gee I don't know well you're a reporter your jobs to know so why are you trying to figure it out instead of calling everything that Republicans do even right so look we're gonna ask you guys to and then there's one last funny twist here first of all a question for you guys is it acceptable to boo the media at political rallies yes or no in my opinion not acceptable to try to kick them out accepted will do any of those things but to boo them and and you guys will have different points of view on that and you on especially on Facebook you can click on the section of the video and and vote ok and I'm curious what you guys think will report that later for you guys what the results are and then finally the funny part is well a bunch of these guys not just that lady a whole bunch of people came up and it costed acosta if you will and and but then something funny happened they started asking for his autograph what and for shout outs yeah and yeah and they wanted to one of the guys who was most vociferous wanted a shout out on air and I figured out why Anna so that seems incongruous that doesn't make any sense right good word it's WWE to them they came for a show Trump puts on a show yeah and Navy you Acosta as in their Little Theater one of the heels they don't actually hate the heel they think he's an actor in that play so like they would want an autograph from The Undertaker they want an autograph from a costly because they think it's all a game but the problem is it's not a game and it's not a game to those kids who are ripped away from their parents it's not a game to the people we bomb whether it's in Syria or the what we do in Yemen with Saudi Arabia it's not a game in all the ways that affects human lives is not a game in tax cut that ripped away resources from the average American being gave it to the very very top those are real life consequences and these goofballs go to these events thinking oh this is so cool we're gonna play a game it's not a freaking game two easy ways to follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe
