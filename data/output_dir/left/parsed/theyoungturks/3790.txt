HURRICANE MARIA HAS
COMPLETELY DESTROYED POWER AND
ELECTRICITY IN PUERTO RICO AND
AT THE MOMENT, WE DON'T HAVE A
NUMBER OF FATALITIES, HOWEVER,
AUTHORITIES ARE EXPECTING SOME
DEATHS AS A RESULT OF THIS HUGE
HURRICANE THAT HAS GONE FROM
CATEGORY FIVE TO CATEGORY FOUR,
BACK TO CATEGORY FIVE AGAIN.
SO
IT'S BEEN CREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE
AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
PHOTOS YOU WILL GET A SENSE OF
JUST HOW SEVERE THE STORM WAS.
UNOFFICIAL FOR THE GOVERNOR OF
PUERTO RICO HAS RELEASED A
STATEMENT SAYING THAT IN TERMS
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE, PUERTO
RICO WILL NOT BE THE SAME.
THIS
IS SOMETHING OF HISTORIC
PROPORTIONS AND HE ALSO SAYS
THAT IT'S A TOTAL DEVASTATION
AND THEY HAVE LOST 100% OF THEIR
POWER, MEANING THAT IT'S
DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE WITH
OFFICIALS THERE AND KIND OF GET
AN ESTIMATE IN TERMS OF THE
DAMAGE AND WHETHER OR NOT LIVES
WERE LOST, BUT IT'S TERRIBLE BY
ITSELF.
THIS NATURAL DISASTER
IS BAD BY ITSELF, BUT YOU ALSO
HAVE TO TAKE THE ENTIRE CONTEXT
IN MIND.
WHAT PUERTO RICO IS
DEALING WITH IN TERMS OF THEIR
ECONOMIC SITUATION AND THIS
JUST ADDS INSULT TO INJURY AND
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THEM.
IT IS DEVASTATING.
IN TERMS
OF HOW QUICKLY SOME HISTORICAL
FACTS ABOUT THIS HURRICANE IN
PARTICULAR, IT IS THE 10TH MOST
INTENSE HURRICANE THAT HAS COME
AND HIT OUT OF THE ATLANTIC AREA
EVER.
IT IS THE MOST INTENSE
HURRICANE, AND IN TERMS OF AN
DENSITY, THAT'S A MEASURE OF
BAROMETRIC PRESSURE NOT
WIND SPEED.
YOU HEARD THAT IT'S A
CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE WHEN A
HIT LAND ALL BUT IT WAS JUST SHY
OF A CATEGORY FIVE WITH A
HUNDRED AND 55 MILE-PER-HOUR
WINDS.
ITÃ­S THE MOST INTENSE
HURRICANE TO HIT PUERTO RICO
SINCE BEFORE THE GREAT
DEPRESSION AND THE DEVASTATION
IS REALLY UNTOLD AND THERE WERE
PEOPLE WHO WERE TOLD BY ONE OF
THE HEADS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE
COMMITTEES TO EVACUATE OR DIE.
THOSE OF THE WORDS THAT THEY
USED AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
TERRIFYING FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO
KIND OF, WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER
A HURRICANE, THERE ARE TWO SIDES
TO IT AND THERE IS THE LEADING
EDGE AND THE TAILING EDGE.
THE
LEADING EDGE HIT PUERTO RICO HEAD
ON BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEND IN
RESCUE WORKERS WHEN THEY HAVE
WINDS OF THIS SPEED BASICALLY
AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY
LIKE EITHER BUNKER DOWN OR GET
OUT IF YOU CAN.
THE OTHER
PROBLEM WITH GETTING OUT IS EVEN
TOURISTY WERE IN THE AREA OR
EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE ESCAPING
THE OTHER ISLANDS IN THE AREA
FROM THE PREVIOUS HURRICANE
WERE BASICALLY TRAPPED IN
PUERTO RICO AND THEY COULDN'T
LEAVE THE ISLAND.
THERE WERE TOURISTS THAT WERE
STUCK IN HOSTELS AND CNN SPOKE
TO A COUPLE OF THEM AND THEY
SAID, LUCKILY, THE PEOPLE
RUNNING THE HOSTILE OR TAKING
GOOD CARE OF US AND WE FELT
SAFE.
THERE WERE OTHERS WHO
SAID, THE BUILDING THAT WERE IN
FEEL STABLE BUT WHAT WERE REALLY
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE FLOODING.
THEY SAID, IF YOU ARE IN A
FLOODPLAIN, A FLOOD PRONE AREA
YOU WILL DIE.
THEY SAID IF YOU
ARE IN A WOODEN HOUSE, YOU WILL
DIE.
IT IS TERRIFYING AND THAT
MIGHT BE A HYPERBOLE TO MOTIVATE
PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY MOVE TO A
SAFER AREA, BUT YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT THE LAST HURRICANE, DID
YOU HEAR ABOUT DELTA FLIGHT 431?
NO.
DELTA FLIGHT 431 WAS THE LAST
FLIGHT TO FLY IN PUERTO RICO TO
GET PEOPLE OUT AND THERE WAS HIS
AVIATION BLOGGER WHO WAS JUST
KIND OF PAYING ATTENTION AND
LOOKED AT THE AVIATION MAP OF
WHERE ALL THE PLANES WERE NEVER
ONE WAS HEADED AWAY AND HE
NOTICED ONE IS TOTALLY JUST
GOING TO PUERTO RICO AFTER
EVERYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND HAS
TURNED AWAY AND PEOPLE STARTED
FOLLOWING IT AND IT STARTED TO
TREND A LITTLE BIT AS EVERYONE
WAS LIKE, I SEE IT, THERE'S KIND
OF A BAND THAT THEY MIGHT BE
ABLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH
AND SO THEY GO IN AND THEY
LANDS, I'M GETTING CHILLS RIGHT
NOW TALKING ABOUT IT, THEY LAND
BETWEEN THE TWO BANDS AND THEY
GET IN AND FROM THE FLIGHT
ATTENDANTS ON BOARD, IT TAKES A
WHILE TO GET, AND THIS WAS A
FULL ON 737 OR EQUIVALENT.
THIS
IS A 3 X 3 PASSENGER MIDSIZE
JETS AND THEY GOT EVERYBODY OFF
AND ON IN A TIME THAT NO ONE
WOULD EVER THINK POSSIBLE.
THEY
SHIFTED THE DEPARTURE EARLY.
MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKE, ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?
THEY WERE LIKE WE'RE LEAVING
EARLIER OR WE'RE NOT LEAVING.
YOU
CAN TRACK THE WHOLE THING
ONLINE.
YOU CAN WATCH IT TRY TO
TAKE OFF INTO THE WIND BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE WIND AND
YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT LIKE, THAT
IS NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR A PLANE
TO TAKE OFF, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH
HEADWIND THAT IT CREATES THE
CORRECT PRESSURE FOR THAT PLANE
A TAKE OFF.
LOOKING YOU GETTING ALL
SCIENTIFIC.
IT'S NOT.
SOME AVIATION
PROFESSIONALS THAT TOOK THE LIFE
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND THEN
ALSO PLACED THEIR LIVES AND THE
LIVES OF OTHERS IN THE HANDS OF
OTHER AVIATION PROFESSIONALS TO
EXECUTE THAT AND IF YOU LOOK AT
IT, IT WAS A RIDICULOUS
TURNAROUND.
BUT IN TERMS OF
WHERE THIS ONE IS GOING FOR
PEOPLE WHO ARE WONDERING WHAT'S
HAPPENING NEXT, IT'S MOVING ON
BY THURSDAY.
IT SHOULD BE IN
TURKS AND CAICOS, SOUTHEASTERN
BAHAMAS AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING,
IT'S TOO EARLY AS GET TO
DETERMINE WHETHER IT WILL
ACTUALLY MAKE LANDFALL IN THE
UNITED STATES.
IT LOOKS LIKE
MOST MODELS ARE SAYING THAT IT
STAYS OUT.
IT GAINS A LITTLE
BIT
MORE STEAM ONCE IT MOVES ON FROM
WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW AND THEN
IT STARTS DISSIPATING AS IT'S
MOVES UP ALONG THE ATLANTIC
COAST.
