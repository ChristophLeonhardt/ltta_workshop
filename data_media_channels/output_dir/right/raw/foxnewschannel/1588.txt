1
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:10,380
>> Martha: REPUBLICANS COULD

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,047
LOSE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IF

3
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:12,249
HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF AS THE

4
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:13,517
PARTY DEALS WITH INFIGHTING AND

5
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:15,252
LEADERSHIP UNCERTAINTY WITH THE

6
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:16,887
IMPENDING EXIT OF THE SPEAKER

7
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:17,254
PAUL RYAN.

8
00:00:17,254 --> 00:00:18,788
AND RUMORS THAT HE IS BEING

9
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:19,689
PUSHED OUT BY HIS OWN PARTY TO

10
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,661
CLEAR WAY.

11
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,295
FOR MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN

12
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:25,662
McCARTHY.

13
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:27,330
THERE ARE RUMORS SWIRLING THAT

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,832
THE VICE PRESIDENT IS WAGING A

15
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:31,468
SHADOW CAMPAIGN OF HIS OWN FOR

16
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:31,902
2020.

17
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:34,104
I ASKED THE VICE PRESIDENT ABOUT

18
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:36,273
BOTH.

19
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:37,240
>> Martha: A LOT OF DISCUSSION

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,974
ABOUT WHETHER PAUL RYAN SHOULD

21
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:39,643
LEAVE EARLY.

22
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:40,343
ONE REPORT THIS MORNING SAID

23
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:43,079
THAT THE PRESIDENT SEES THE

24
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,880
MERITS OF THAT PLAN, OF AN

25
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,452
EARLIER EXIT FOR PAUL RYAN AND

26
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:50,353
SOONER SPEAKERSHIP FOR KEVIN

27
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:50,720
McCARTHY.

28
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,454
DO YOU AGREE?

29
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:53,657
TO SEE THE MERITS OF THAT?

30
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:55,058
>> I KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

31
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:56,426
AND I HOLD SPEAKER PAUL RYAN IN

32
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:58,862
THE HIGHEST REGARD.

33
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:01,031
HE SPENT A GREAT PARTNER DURING

34
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:02,499
THIS CONGRESS IN PASSING TAX

35
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:06,236
CUTS AND DEREGULATION, HISTORIC

36
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:07,037
INVESTMENT IN OUR MILITARY.

37
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:08,705
YOU WILL SEE THAT PROGRESS AGAIN

38
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,441
THIS WEEK WITH THE PASSAGE OF VA

39
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:15,045
CHOICE AND BANKING REFORMS AND

40
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:17,280
RIGHT TO TRY THAT WILL HELP

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,582
VULNERABLE PATIENTS ALL ACROSS

42
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:18,915
AMERICA.

43
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:20,417
WE ALSO HOLD LEADER KEVIN

44
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:22,686
McCARTHY IN THE HIGHEST REGARD

45
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,120
AND I KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S FOCUS

46
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,289
IS ON CONTINUING TO WORK WITH

47
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:27,691
BOTH OF THESE LEADERS IN THE

48
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:28,458
DAYS AHEAD TO MAKE PROGRESS FOR

49
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,093
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

50
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:31,261
>> Martha: SO DO YOU THINK

51
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,263
THAT PAUL RYAN WILL BE BEFORE

52
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:34,264
THE MIDTERM?

53
00:01:34,264 --> 00:01:36,266
>> I THINK THAT WILL BE A

54
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:36,900
DECISION FOR SPEAKER RYAN.

55
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,801
>> Martha: HE SAID HE WANTS TO

56
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,135
STAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

57
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:41,404
>> HE HAS ARTICULATED THAT AND I

58
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:43,640
THINK HE HAS STOOD BY THAT.

59
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,675
BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THE

60
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:47,877
PRESIDENT AND I ARE VERY

61
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:49,479
GRATEFUL TO SPEAKER PAUL RYAN,

62
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,647
TO LEADER McCARTHY, TO THE

63
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,115
ENTIRE LEADERSHIP TEAM IN THE

64
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:52,649
HOUSE.

65
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:53,416
THEY'VE REALLY BEEN DELIVERING

66
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,118
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

67
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:56,186
>> Martha: THAT SOUNDS LIKE

68
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:56,886
YOU WOULD BE OKAY WITH AN

69
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:59,389
EARLIER TRANSITION.

70
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:01,992
>> I THINK I PERSONALLY WOULD BE

71
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:03,326
OKAY WITH WHATEVER THE MEMBERS

72
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,662
OF CONGRESS CHOSE TO DO BECAUSE

73
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,831
THIS IS A TEAM THAT HAS BEEN

74
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:09,765
DELIVERING, BUT AT THE END OF

75
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:13,069
THE DAY, OUR FOCUS IS ON THE

76
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,037
AGENDA THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS

77
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:18,275
ELECTED TO ADVANCE IN THIS

78
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:19,075
CONGRESS HAS BEEN DELIVERING ON

79
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,977
THAT AGENDA FROM DAY ONE.

80
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,479
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT ALL

81
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,613
THESE ARTICLES ABOUT YOUR SHADOW

82
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:25,548
CAMPAIGN OPERATION AND THAT YOU

83
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:27,450
ARE SEEKING TO EXERCISE

84
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,151
EXPANSIVE CONTROL OVER THE

85
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,086
POLITICAL PARTY THAT IS

86
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:31,788
OSTENSIBLY HOMED BY

87
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:33,823
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

88
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:36,626
>> [LAUGHS]

89
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:39,896
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT ONLY

90
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:40,664
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

91
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:41,531
HE'S THE LEADER OF MY PARTY AND

92
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:44,834
HE'S MY FRIEND AND IT WAS MY

93
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:45,602
GREAT HONOR TO CAMPAIGN SHOULDER

94
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:48,071
TO SHOULDER WITH HIM IN 2016 AND

95
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:48,705
I LOOK FORWARD TO DOING

96
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:52,342
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO SEE

97
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:53,576
PRESIDENT TRUMP REELECTED IN

98
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:53,877
2020.

99
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:55,679
IN THE MEANTIME WE'VE GOT SOME

100
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,047
MIDTERM ELECTIONS COMING UP AND

101
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,448
EARLIER THIS YEAR WE WENT TO

102
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:00,350
CAMP DAVID AND WE MET WITH SOME

103
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,017
OF THOSE SAME CONGRESSIONAL

104
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:03,019
LEADERS WE WERE JUST TALKING

105
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,622
ABOUT AND WE LAID OUT AN AGENDA

106
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:06,323
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND I HAVE

107
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:08,858
BEEN EXECUTING ON SEAMLESSLY.

108
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:10,593
I CAN PROMISE YOU WE ARE GOING

109
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:11,795
TO CONTINUE TO CAMPAIGN HARD ALL

110
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:13,663
THE WAY THROUGH THE MIDTERMS.

111
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:15,498
WE ARE GOING TO SEE THESE

112
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:16,232
REPUBLICAN MAJORITIES REELECTED

113
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:18,668
AND WE ARE GOING TO LAY A GREAT

114
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:19,235
FOUNDATION TO REELECT

115
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:19,869
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

116
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:21,471
LOOK AT THE PROGRESS THAT WE

117
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:22,572
HAVE MADE, MARTHA.

118
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:25,075
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

119
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,176
MORE THAN 3 MILLION JOBS.

120
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:27,210
>> Martha: REPORTEDLY STORIES

121
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,578
COME FROM THAT YOU HAVE THE

122
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:29,112
SHADOW ORGANIZATION?

123
00:03:29,112 --> 00:03:31,081
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

124
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:31,548
>> IT BEATS ME.

125
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:36,286
I DON'T KNOW OTHER THAN JUST THE

126
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,954
WHISPER CAMPAIGN THAT TENDS TO

127
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:38,722
HAPPEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C., FROM

128
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:40,290
TIME TO TIME.

129
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,257
IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY

130
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,861
LIFE TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO

131
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,462
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

132
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:46,196
HE'S NOT A LIMIT PRESIDENT, BUT

133
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,031
HE'S MY FRIEND.

134
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:52,235
WE'VE DEVELOPED A VERY CLOSE

135
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:52,669
RELATIONSHIP.

136
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:55,105
>> Martha: IS HE HEARD OF THE

137
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:55,438
STORIES?

138
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:57,741
>> Martha: I COULDN'T BE MORE

139
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,043
PROUD OF THE STORIES.

140
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:00,777
>> Martha: DOES HE REVIEW

141
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:03,279
ABOUT THE STORIES?

142
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,647
>> HE RIPS ME ABOUT A LOT OF

143
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:05,348
DIFFERENT THINGS, BUT IT'S A

144
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:09,452
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP AND KAREN AND

145
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:10,253
I ARE JUST, WE ARE GRATEFUL.

146
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:12,455
IF WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE

147
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:13,690
PARTNERSHIP, WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR

148
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,457
THE FRIENDSHIP AND WE COULDN'T

149
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,358
BE MORE HAPPY TO SEE MELANIA

150
00:04:16,358 --> 00:00:00,000
BACK AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND
