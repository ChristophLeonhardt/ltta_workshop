oh hello everyone how is everyone doing
it is mr. selfie and today leizerman you
guys for the title we are back with the
final episode of the old 2 so now in
this video like gentlemen I'm gonna be
showing off pretty much all of the
endings now I say pretty much because
there is a shit ton of combinations look
at this graph that I made okay I was
going to show off every single a
combination of ending possible okay but
then I realized most of these are
exactly the same okay so what I'm gonna
show off basically is I've already
showed off beyond okay if you want to
watch that video go down in description
okay now what I'm going to show you is
if we chose the life option and I'm
going to show you if we chose life if
everyone survived or if everyone died
okay that they're quite similar okay but
let's just choose life okay ladies
gentlemen okay so we're at the ending
again okay last time I chose beyond so I
think now it's time to choose life
it's okay Jodi it's okay you're going
back
damn Oh Jody
Oh Oh showed it

my life without item
Oh Jo Jo Krakow cry
oh man
how are we gonna live without item items
been there since day one homies
oh shit B oh here we go Black Sun okay
so I think oh that was different is that
I just chose life yeah everything's the
same okay I made everything the same I
just chose life whoa where are we now
the forest oh this looks beautiful is
this where we live in the middle of
nowhere in the forest
Oh ever since the Black Sun was
destroyed my memory has been
disintegrating I spent too much time on
the other side now it's eating away at
my mind erasing what's left of them my
memories are all confused
slowly self-destructing fading like a
dream when you wake up I'm losing my
sense of time I no longer know what
happened before or after whoa
everything's playing inside my head at
the same time
it's like watching the same film looping
over and over again a chaos of images
with no order so I've been writing night
and day for weeks trying to put my life
down on paper
if I forget everything these pages will
be my memory war months after the fact
the investigation continues in an effort
to determine the cause of the accident
that cost 283 lives on a Pentagon
military base wall government
representatives confirm that the
authorities are working hand-in-hand
with the investigators to shed light on
this appalling tragedy the CIA is
leaving me alone for the moment I
suppose they're too busy building
another condenser to worry about me
I know they'll never been in their
experiments now that they know it's on
the other side honestly I don't give a
damn now I need to reconstruct my life
whoa my life without ID Oh
Jodi for as long as I can remember I
dreamt of living without him Oh I'm tied
without his constant presence by myself
I got what I wanted
I've never been so unhappy in my life
feel like part of me has been implicated
Oh crying all day
I know it's stupid shit shit I miss him
so much
oh hi done you were such a big part of
Jodie away what's happening now it's
cold we have a different cutscene for
cold he's no longer on a computer
anymore he's checking his mail uh okay

Santa hello what's in the letter

so happy yeah

lots of nothing passing by and I woke up
knew it was time time to start again not
a new life oh shit okay okay okay so I
heard about this so you can either
choose to have four ending so there's
like sub there's like four sub endings
to up to this so there's Ryan J Zoe or
Lois we get to decide who we want to be
with okay I'm gonna do it order first
I'm gonna do Ryan so obvious
deep inside I always knew
I just needed the silence around to hear
what I was feeling whoa Ryan
it took me a while to realize hunter
loved him
oh I've been alone beside for so long
I forgotten what it was like to have all
Ryan
haha kissy
Oh
kiss
Oh Bryan turned out to be a good guy in
the end I don't know he's okay he's a
cool dude man he's a cool man with
jammer so this is what my life with Ryan
is he going to show me like what my
right what my life's gonna be like with
Ryan no happy ever after
I think I don't know her ah she baby Oh
we traveled as far away as we could what
I bought I had the one to love again
Jesus Christ Ryan he's ballin put my
trust in someone to stuff I was on
running away
whoa sure
I had to learn to lose Oh
Ryan and I never talked about it again
as if it all never happened
shit
as if the other side didn't exist hmm as
if it could never come back into our
lives
oh no doesn't seem like she's happy guys
still seems like she's a bit upset who
can blame her though
Jesus Christ as sexy though all kissy

Haydn's back
Oh bad
ah look at Joey she's not yeah I got
everything now I'm spot my homeboy
what's with this music it sounds like
sort of like
dear God
is that the ending now shippi shared you
debbie is that it
how's the credits roll then whoa it's
the same thing things at night
Jodi's saying it terrifying things whoa
Jodee tell myself it's only nightmares
but I know it's not true
whoa
once Pandora's box is open
can never be close to him
whoa
so what does it matter happen
dear God the apocalypse okay so I think
my friend of dozen whoa damn so I think
that ending happens for no matter what
okay so but last time it was that little
gold Tuesday's girl that did it but now
it's Jody cuz she lived hmm okay let's
move on okay now lays German we are
gonna be doing the J sardius deep inside
I always knew I just needed the silence
around me to hear what I was feeling
okay come on Jodi we've seen this before
oh I told Ryan I couldn't see my future
with him oh we've been through too many
difficult times together all times I
want to forget
he said he understood that he'd wait as
long as it takes
oh I know I felt something for him just
wasn't strong enough
damn oh we are back in the desert Jay
Jay Jay is bait
okay now this cutscene is a little bit
different because we saved par so pause
should be in this cutscene but it's the
exact same but without part if we didn't
save him because he could have died so
yeah that's hot that's hot so in the
other cutscene he's not there okay so
I'm not going to show that because
there's no point it's the exact same but
Jody's back
Jody
oh look at her she came back on the
motorcycle that they gave up J right
towards it
ahahaha hug hug daddy
gum it daddy coming out
it's okay T and what a happy Oh
we bloody had the bloody sack sings sure
okay so he came to come live with us in
the bloody cabin again Geordie doesn't
look happy
oh look at Jack was he playing naked not
yell
Charlie
whoa who's that brat
I did I did still here I do she's
laughing
whoa that felt a bit different
hmm I think the Ryan one I don't know
our case is the same okay it's the same
this happens for everyone okay let's
move on to the other ending okay so
we've done rolled on Jake now it's time
to do Zoe so obvious
it was so obvious inside I always knew
okay yeah you always knew how many times
what see is Jody ah okay we tell Ryan to
piss off yeah we've seen this before
they took me in when I was alone oh
we're going back Jews that when all I
could think of was dying
oh they shared the little they had
without knowing me or judging me deep
down I knew that my place was there yeah
what some Oh Stan Stan does odd jobs I
was in there Jimmy's gone back to school
he's clean
all that's nice Tuesday works behind a
bar
Walter looks after wills oh oh they're
not rolling in money but
they manage Oh I never told them about
my past and they never asked
they love me for who I am to some weird
chick who talks to Severus
Oh baby Zoe took to me like we'd always
known each other though you're something
about her big sad eyes that reminds me
of the little girl I once was oh how she
was different from the moment I saw
we haven't talked about it we both know
we have something coming Oh baby
is there ending gonna be different like
that
I see things at night is this the same
terrifying T well no no it's difference
difference different I tell myself it's
only nightmares this time it's me and
Zoe I know it's not true whoa only one
who can save the world it's a little
girl what I have to prepare I know I
don't have much time
it's Pandora's box Wow
damn it's not nightmares
that's what is about to happen whoa okay
so that so that ending was a little bit
different because we had Zoe and me okay
so if three like combinations either
just Zoe but just me or me and Zoe okay
that's pretty weird okay then let's do
the last one which is the alone ending
so okay it was so obvious
deep inside I always know okay let's get
this come on Jodi you already know okay
now we tell Ryan that we don't see a
future with them yeah we've seen this
unknown how could I live a normal life
again after all I've been through oh
we're back on the road who wants to live
a normal life anyway boyfriend job
counting the days till my next vacation
oh I wanted it for so long but I finally
realized that that life wasn't for me so
I took to the road
I've seen many risks to the other side
hundreds are from all over the country
what
homes or strange things happen
whoa motel rooms that no one ever wants
to speak
entities are all around us what within
our houses
sleeping our bags whoa now with us every
second of every day
oh my gosh they're lurking in the
shadows
what entities are all around us is up is
that for everyone or just for me that's
weird
this this endings terrible this is the
most depressing one now jollies all by
yourself in a hotel room oh my god oh
shit is the bloody monsters again Jordi
you better get out of that what was the
music is this
arts idem he comes back no matter what
ah-ah
haha okay so I'd encom's back no matter
what okay see you I mean there's like
all these combinations okay I think
that's the exact same but yeah like
there's there's all these got
combinations which is like there's like
slight differences which I don't think
there's any point me showing on the
endings anyway so the next ending that
I'm gonna show is that if Cole and Ryan
died while we are in the Black Sun
mission and yeah actually I'll show you
guys what happens when they die oh okay
and now Cole holes and then boom and
then I don't run today there was nothing
you could do
we gotta get out of here oh shit
so that's how cold dies in the condenser
I mean in the Black Sun shit man
rest in peace cold man okay here we go
okay so I need him to shoot me okay guys
are shit Nathan no don't stop you're not
gonna stop me from seeing my crap oh
shit okay here we go with trolling
island now what we basically to do is we
need to let him kill me
well played again aash on the other side
my god oh right
Oh
No
right no no no
Ryan yeah maybe there's no point back
right
this shirts not yet
or she said I love you
all right Roy oh shit
she lost cold Nathan and now Ryan Jesus
Christ anything can be bad or Jodi
ah shit so that's how you kill all of
them I guess there's a way Nathan can
kill himself I guess I'll show you that
in a second oh man that's sighs okay so
now I'm going to choose life again okay
now this is exactly the same except for
two cutscenes are different oh shit shit
wah-wah-wah-wah-wah and jump oh she
jumps by herself
okay so before though what she docked on
Ryan ah shit
now is this different because there's no
Ryan
Jody
oh so it's the same
I did Oh
I did oh shit hi
oh shit okay so the exact same except
Ryan isn't there to comfort her okay see
what I'm talking about there's slight
differences is it worth me doing that or
I playing for a whole game sure but you
get what I mean guys there's slight
differences there's no point me showing
you all of those combinations I miss him
so much
oh this is different
I didn't it's not the only one I miss
now that Ryan's gone I realize how much
I love to oh no I understand how Nathan
must have felt nothing is worse than
knowing you'll never hold someone in
your arms again man I said and this is
on our odds coal man that's sad
oh damn call it took months Oh answer
nothing passing by then I woke up I knew
it was time time to start again to build
a new life oh okay so now you get to
pick the ending in the graveyard rather
in your cabin so alone Jo Zoe but
there's no Ryan because Ryan died so
that's the only difference I think if
you pick the same options it will give
you the same thing pretty much so uh
yeah oh there's just one more ending
that you could do basically you could
fail the black stone you could not turn
off the condenser okay so I believe you
do that by failing the QuickTime events
so I'm gonna go play the game again and
show you that okay
what if I choose move
like all these souls your grief has made
you forget who you are your wife and
daughter are gone
I don't think you can reason with it
would later
I miss them so much work move move again
to stop this
I know it's not
Oh
I think he's I think he he's not going
to shoot music
yeah that's it
for their Marvin sir no Nathan they
thought
kills himself
he kills himself misty oh shit do so
much Oh
you're the only one who can fix this
Julia okay so do it
your darling Oh do it for me now the
thing is that I'm gonna fail this so
ever yeah sorry I can't fix it Nathan
okay who's the quick time events so
let's just press X for a little bit now
so I believe if we fail these we will
all here we go here we go okay so I'm
not pressing anything I'm not pressing
anything oh shit
I'll shake it no okay okay okay no I
meant to bail these oh shit this is bad
okay okay I'll fail these from now on
okay here we go
xxx okay I'm not gonna press anything
okay don't rest easy oh shit don't shake
it
No
oh my god
whoa okay so the Black Sun so I think it
should be different now yeah look five
percent died before reaching the Black
Sun Dan okay here we go
nothing there's nothing love nothing but
death chaos and destruction the info
world has overwhelmed our world oh my
gosh she cast its shroud over the living
Jesus billions fragrance of souls
wandering in silence
the world I was born into has
disappeared forever wall still the
images from my life collide in my head
I try to remember each second what I did
where I fail what I could have done to
avoid what happened
ever since I died I've let myself float
along cold wave my hunger for obscurity
of living I am alone as my guilt
Jesus this is dog
along for eternity
whoa okay that was probably the the
worse then you can get just completely
failing the mission okay guys I'm gonna
end the video here now there is a couple
of like variation cutscenes but they
will literally take me just an hour to
get like 30 seconds of footage okay so
like these are the main main endings now
if you want to see that like the Beyond
endings then go down description and
watch the last episode which was my
ending which I choose
I chose beyond my playthrough and yeah
anyway guys I was it guy starts watching
this took a long time to leave a god
damn like it seems we hit 20,000 now I
have another idea for a beyond 2 souls
video I'm gonna go back in the story and
show other possibilities of how you
finish are the other missions okay so um
that seems like a good fun idea for a
video take it will take me long time as
well so if we reach 20,000 likes on this
video I will do another special Beyond
video on that but if we don't I won't
fit you guys again for the support on
the series it's been absolutely amazing
you know like I've said it all in the
previous video I don't want to ramble on
for too long but yeah you guys have
really opened up my eyes for Let's Plays
in the future and I definitely I'm gonna
do more okay guys
but anyway guys I don't think I saw
watching and I will see you in the
garden mix with your man Soleri guys
love you ba ba
