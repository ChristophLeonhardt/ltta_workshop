1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,270
“I’ve seen the soldiers and
the trucks of the soldiers —

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,990
they’re holding guns.”

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,940
It wasn’t supposed
to be like this.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,190
“People have been
beaten by the soldiers.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,405
Some of our guys 
have been killed.”

6
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:15,030
This was supposed to be
the moment that

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,070
proved that Zimbabwe
was moving on

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,841
from its oppressive past.

9
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:22,860
Instead, city streets
look like this,

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,080
with soldiers opening
fire on protesters

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,210
and leaving at least three
people dead only days

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,950
after an election.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,080
“It’s not safe, it’s not safe —

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,840
the soldiers, they are
coming, that side.”

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,040
Reporter: “O.K.
Oh, we should go? Let’s go.”

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,545
So what happened?

17
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,982
Here’s what we saw.

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,680
This is Harare, the
capital, two days earlier.

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,470
Polls are about to open, but
the lines are already long.

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,620
Voters are
peaceful and excited.

21
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,740
“I woke up 
early in the morning.

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,070
I didn’t have time 
to bathe today

23
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,630
because I was really eager

24
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,740
to come and vote.”

25
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,220
This is the first
election in decades

26
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,560
without the name of
Zimbabwe’s longtime leader,

27
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,330
Robert Mugabe, on the ballot.

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,460
A military coup 
in November

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,060
forced Mugabe out,

30
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,520
raising hopes that the system

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,700
he put in place would
also go away.

32
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,090
For a while, violence subsided,

33
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,410
and people 
talked more openly,

34
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,940
allowing someone like Vincent

35
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,310
to show his support
for the opposition.

36
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,670
“People were not free to
express our feelings,

37
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,370
like we are doing right now.

38
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,650
So now voting is something
that we are doing willingly.

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,340
Today I’ve exercised my right.
I’m very happy.”

40
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,220
We drive east, 
away from the city.

41
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,970
We see fewer signs of
support for the opposition.

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,430
Rural areas are
traditional strongholds

43
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,270
for the ruling party,
mostly because

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,860
of years of intimidation
and vote rigging.

45
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,820
We saw people walk miles to
reach their polling centers.

46
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,190
Unlike in
previous elections,

47
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,220
this time the ruling party
promised transparency.

48
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,900
And to convince the world, 
Emmerson Mnangagwa,

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,260
the ruling party candidate

50
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,970
who replaced Mugabe 
after the coup,

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,040
invited international observers.

52
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,270
But in these
rural villages, we didn’t

53
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,130
see any of those observers.

54
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,190
Instead, we saw this:

55
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,720
This man is camped outside a
polling station, writing down

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,970
the names of everyone
coming to vote.

57
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,590
It’s an old strategy
that could mean

58
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,410
food and fertilizer
for those on his list

59
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,810
or retribution for
those who are not.

60
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,210
His name is Norman.

61
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,470
When confronted, he
shows us his list

62
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,200
and quickly starts
to explain that he’s

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,260
part of a larger group,
mobilized by the ruling party,

64
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,040
spread across
multiple villages.

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,380
Police and election officials watch.

66
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,920
“So this is the complaint.”

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,690
They don’t try to
stop him, but they

68
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,520
ask us to stop shooting.

69
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,830
"Off the camera,
yes we can talk —

70
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,825
off the camera.”

71
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,575
Reporter: “We’ll turn it off.”

72
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,620
It’s the next day 
and markets reopen,

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,820
while people wait
for official results.

74
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
But they don’t come.

75
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,610
Optimism turns to unease,
with growing concerns

76
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,360
that the vote count
will not be fair.

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,470
In a preemptive move,

78
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,090
Nelson Chamisa, the leading
opposition candidate

79
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,180
takes to social media
and claims victory.

80
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,190
Hours later, he
deletes this tweet.

81
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,418
But it’s too late.

82
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,790
Hundreds of his supporters
take to the streets

83
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,990
to celebrate in front of the
party headquarters.

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,270
Wednesday morning,

85
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,310
still no winner.

86
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,810
In the meantime,
officials announce

87
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,740
a sweeping parliamentary
victory for the ruling party

88
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,390
and international observers
release statements

89
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,300
criticizing the election.

90
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,550
Protests form, peaceful at first.

91
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,230
But quickly escalate.

92
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,960
Soldiers and army tanks deploy,

93
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,870
hunting down 
opposition supporters.

94
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,540
In just over 48 hours,

95
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,760
we watched as a hopeful
city was overtaken by fear

96
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,410
and now is bracing for
the announcement

97
00:04:17,410 --> 00:00:00,000
of who the next president
will be.
