an evangelical influencer has gotten a lot of heat because of the fact that she's been incredibly outspoken against Donald Trump and she fairly recently said that she was supportive of same-sex marriage now evangelicals didn't take kindly to that and while some still like to follow her and follow the work that she does a lot of people started sending her death threats and sent her books back to her home address and started threatening her her name is Jen Hatmaker and recently Politico did an excellent profile about her and what she went through in 2016 when she decided to break away from conventional evangelicals and speak out against Donald Trump Pat maker effectively joined never Trump evangelicals telling her more than half a million Facebook followers that Donald Trump made her quote sad and horrified and despondent damn drums okay so it's actually not that much of drums or shouldn't be right so she's saying something I would argue really inoffensive like when Donald Trump talks about grabbing women by the genitals without their permission you would think that good Christians would be opposed to that concept right whether the fact that that's even controversial is amazing like and they make it seem like she's the bad Christian because she was horrified at the thought of a guy who might be present and most powerful man in the country arguably in the world who brags about sexual assault of women yeah like that would appear to be the immoral thing and she would be standing up for morality but evangelicals according to polling are the one demographic group in the country that cares about morality the least she didn't realize that it's pretty incredible so I loved reading about her because not only did I learn about her I didn't even know she existed prior to political profiling her but I learned a lot about myself because on election night I was really harsh toward female Trump supporters right and I called them stupid I said I don't respect them and then you know I took a step back and I'm like is that the right way to handle a situation where you disagree with people and then I realized wait a minute it's not no way it's not because I disagree with political ideology in this case Jen Hatmaker and I are very different she's still very Christian it does not you know agree with me when it comes to issues like reproductive rights things that really matter to me but it doesn't matter I don't dislike her because she's a person who's principled and she's a person who understands you know if I'm gonna go around preaching about morality I can't be supportive of someone who openly brags about assaulting women and so for me it was about what Donald Trump represented it wasn't a political ideology it was the fact that he disrespected women openly talked about you know his disdain for certain types of women and if that's what really but funneled me I guess when it came to some of his supporters and and let's just note that it's not just Access Hollywood tapes I mean he did a thousand times but you know saying that women that claim that he sexually harassed them that they wouldn't be good-looking enough to be worthy of his gropes basically yeah oh he's such a monster he you know the Miss Universe contestant that he belittled by calling her Miss Piggy and Miss housecleaning because she was a Latina he's such a bad guy and and when he talked about megyn kelly bleeding from wherever and so if you're a self-respecting woman and you know this guy is deeply misogynistic at a bare minimum maybe if not stupid certainly ignorant to vote for him and so anyway when Jen Hatmaker made the moral case against Donald Trump that's what really got under the other evangelicals skin because she was basically putting up a mirror to them and showing them who they really are it's incredible so let's hear from Jen Hatmaker herself here are some of her quotes after the Access Hollywood tape leaked and prominent evangelical men came to Trump's defense she tweeted we will not forget nor will we forget the Christian leaders that betrayed their sisters in Christ for power the way people spoke about us It was as if I had never loved Jesus a day in my life and I was just an ally think about how our gay brothers and sisters feel so that's exactly why she even though again she's evangelical Christian I don't agree with that at all and you know I'm agnostic etc but she broke out of that circle of fear and hate if you ask me because she was able to empathize her a sec yes like that's the thing again just because we disagree doesn't mean I'm automatically gonna disrespect or dislike her right we disagree on a lot of things but I respect her because she's a woman of her convictions she understands when something's wrong it's wrong and you need to speak out about it and I respect her so much because she was advised over and over and over again by the evangelical community to not speak out to not openly support same-sex marriage and she's like no I'm not I'm not gonna hide Who I am in one of her quotes she said my insides need to match my outside and and the threats weren't just hate is a bad idea Jesus would love sexual assault and would be a proponent of it and and would brag about it and would support the guy who was bragging about it it wasn't just absurdities like that it was threatening her business yeah and you're like this isn't gonna work out for you look the way we make monies by appealing to these guys I would argue monsters and so if you go out there and try to do the moral thing you ain't gonna make a buck out of it and well they had some validity to that particular argument mm-hmm because his animation not only did they send back the books to her some of them had already burned the books or shredded some of the pages and then send it back to her right and then LifeWay Christian Stores pulled her books from the shelves and said that'll show you okay so if you love Jesus you want to sing his praises you want to do all these moral things oh yeah we're gonna undercut you make sure you don't get any money because you wouldn't toll the political line that we have so this is my absolute favorite part about learning about her so she gets the threats and there were other evangelical leaders who also spoke out against Trump and they got so much criticism and backlash that they essentially went on apology tours right cuz it was hurting their business but not Jen Hatmaker in fact Jen Hatmaker remained defiant because she's a principled person and so while she's getting all this criticism and all this hate she decides to let people know whether or not she'll ever apologize for what she's saying this is what she posted on her Instagram page and I absolutely love it she's wearing a shirt that's I ain't sorry yes I love her so much this is again I don't care if we disagree on things just the fact that she's principled and she understands what real morality is makes me respect her to no end so I you know in issue said this year I became painfully aware of the Machine the Christian machine and they do they have a political machine and and if you dare cross it they'll strike back in many different ways I think that one of the things that look I too don't want to get too much into her personal life she and I don't know all the views that she held her or holds now but she has a couple of kids that she adopted from Ethiopia so that among I'm sure other things made her sympathetic to civil rights for black people in this country and then civil rights for LGBT members plus other thing about the whole Jesus loving everybody and the Sermon on the Mount and you know and do unto others as you'd have them do unto you and what was supposed to be the Christian principles instead of fear and loathing towards anyone who doesn't look like you which is not what Jesus said and it's so to me it is really interesting that the Christian so-called Christian machine tries to crush anyone who's actually preaching Jesus's gospel if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday
