PUBLIC SENTIMENT HAS SHIFTED ON
GUN CONTROL, SPECIFICALLY WITHIN
THE RANKS OF THE NRA.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHEN I SEE IT, TO ME IT SAYS
THIS IS KIND OF AGAINST THE GUN
SHOW LOOPHOLE, THIS IS TRYING TO
GET TO COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND
CHECKS, NO MATTER WHERE YOU
TRY TO GET A GUN AND THAT IS
69% OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NRA
MEMBERS ARE IN SUPPORT OF THAT.
REACTION?
I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU THIS
GUYS FOR A LONG TIME AND
THERE'S A REASON WHY.
THERE WAS AN EARLIER POLL IN THE
LAST MASSACRE, NOT EVEN THE
LAST ONE, SEVERAL MASSACRES AGO
AND THEY DID A POLL JUST
LIKE THIS WHEN THEY TRIED TO GET
FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECKS
TO PASS IN CONGRESS.
IN FACT, ONE OF THE NUMBERS IN
THIS POLL ARE SLIGHTLY LOWER
THAN THE ONE IN THAT POLL FROM
THAT MASSACRE WHERE 93% OF ALL
AMERICANS WANTED FEDERAL
BACKGROUND CHECKS, BUT
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS.
THE BACKGROUND CHECK IS, RIGHT
NOW THERE IS A LOOPHOLE
IF YOU GO TO WALMART OR A
LICENSED RETAILER YOU
HAVE TO GO THROUGH A BACKGROUND
CHECK.
EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THAT
BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO
WALMART OR WHATEVER YOU CAN JUST
GO TO A PRIVATE GUN SHOW AND
THEN THERE IS NO CHECK, NO
REGULATION.
A CRIMINAL CAN GET IT, SOMEBODY
WITH A GIANT RAP SHEET COULD
GET IT, A VIOLENT PERSON CAN,
TERRORIST, ANYBODY BECAUSE
THERE IS NO CHECK ON IT AT ALL.
THAT IS WHY EVEN NRA MEMBERS,
SEVEN OUT OF 10
OF THEM GO, I HAD TO DO A
BACKGROUND CHECK, WHY
SHOULDN'T YOU BE ABLE TO DO
A BACKGROUND CHECK?
MANY OF THEM DIDN'T BUY AT A
PRIVATE GUN SHOW, MOST AT A
RETAILER.
THIS IS A MOMENT WERE YOU'RE
LIKE, WE ALL AGREE, CAN WE
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
AND TRUMP SAYS, SURE, THAT
SOUNDS A BIT LIKE IT MAKE SENSE
BECAUSE I HEARD A NUMBER THAT
MAKES SENSE AND THEN HE
DISAPPEARS AND TALKS TO THE NRA
AND THEN HE REAPPEARS AND HE'S
LIKE, ACTUALLY, WE CANNOT DO
ANY OF THAT.
THAT IS FRUSTRATING.
OVERALL NUMBERS, 89% OF
RESPONDENTS WHO DON'T OWN A
FIREARM SAID OF COURSE.
OF COURSE DO BACKGROUND CHECKS
ON PEOPLE BUYING GUNS,
OTHERWISE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO IS
BUYING THEM.
MY FAVORITE STAT IS 78% OF GUN
OWNERS, IF YOU CANNOT PASS A
BILL TO DO FEDERAL BACKGROUND
CHECKS ON GUNS WHEN 78% OF
GUNOWNERS SAY DO IT, THAT MEANS
WE DO NOT LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY
BECAUSE THEORETICALLY THE REASON
THEY ARE NOT DOING IT IS TO
PROTECT THE GUNOWNERS AND THEIR
RIGHTS, BUT THE GUNOWNERS SAY,
NO, I WANT YOU TO THE BACKGROUND
CHECK.
THERE IS ONLY ONE SET OF PEOPLE
IN THE COUNTRY WHO DO NOT
WANT THE BACKGROUND CHECK.
THOSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SELL
GUNS.
SO WE ARE AT THEIR MERCY, NO
MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE AGREE.
