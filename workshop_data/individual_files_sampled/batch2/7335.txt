hours following the mass shooting that occurred in Las Vegas there were a number of fake news articles that were going viral on social media now you could have found these articles on a number of different platforms including Google's trending news or Facebook's trending news and unfortunately there was an orchestrated effort in order to push out false information or misinformation regarding the perpetrator of the mass shooting so according to the New York Times when it came to Google trolls from 4chan had spent the night scheming about how to pin the shooting on liberals one of their discussion threads in which they wrongly identified the gunman was picked up by Google's top stories module and spent hours at the top of the site's search results for that man's name so oh that's so funny 4chan so what no authorities cops are trying to find the right guy hey let's waste their time maybe the guy could murder more people while we're having fun on 4chan that's so funny you're so 15 years old or worse yet you're a 35 year old and you're the saddest saddest man alive and you know I don't know what picture they use in that particular case and God forbid if you pick the wrong guy and it's an actual citizen it's that it's not a meme and then people gonna go chase that guy and God knows what they're gonna do when we encourage violence we're such a crack-up at fortune yeah and look I know that in the past for Chan or forums on 4chan have done things as practical jokes and they do think it's funny in this case it appears to be an orchestrated effort to pin the blame on liberals like oh this is an anti-trump Rachel Maddow watching hey shooter right a 4chan thank you for admitting that you're on the wrong side so anyone who participating that's not everybody a 4chan did that's okay for the folks who did it right you have to lie about how it's a Rachel Maddow supporting liberal because you know that likely it's a right-winger and it's right-wingers who don't want any gun control who encourage the guys like this guy to buy 42 weapons who celebrated it that and and you know that you're on the wrong that's why you have to lie see if you weren't on the wrong side you wouldn't have to lie but you do that and you do it on purpose because you know you're wrong so that's fine thank you for the admission that being conservative equals being a dirtbag so that's why you had to lie about liberals cuz you don't actually have any goods oh okay thank you for the admission was Thanks oh damn salty J I'm enjoying salty jank today okay okay alright cuz I'm feeling very light and fluffy so not me take over the salty part all right right-wingers lie pathologically they do it all the time and our stupid media calls it even when do you ever see a laughing organization or a blog or a forum just make stuff up and go oh the right-wing did a mass murder are you kidding me if they did 1% of that the rest of the media would rise up and their fury and go look at these despicable progressives how dare they do this right a shooter once thought of Bernie Sanders oh my god it's Bernie Sanders fault now these guys they lie for a living that's what they do I don't know if they think it's funny they know that they're wrong and pathetic so they do it and and every sec oh i okay well that's the right-wing that's okay that's okay let's just keep calling it even yeah look it's obviously not okay but propaganda has always been around what makes this situation different is that more and more people are relying on social media in order to get their news now some of some of those people get their news on social media because of its convenience most people are on social media throughout the day anyway but there's also this lack of trust toward traditional forms of media and so it's kind of crazy when it comes to younger generations there's more of a reliance on social media and these are individuals who know how to basically play the algorithm game right this is all about algorithms how is it that there's their fake news stories managed to get the attention that it does they know how to optimize you know certain tags and certain headlines in order for these stories to go viral so that was Google now let's go on to Facebook before we do let me just explain a little bit more detail in that google part so how did they get the restoring the Google's top module well since pick the wrong guy and they knew it's the wrong guy that guy has no search results about him so it search results about him being the shooter go to the top for his name which then is how they game the system into having everybody think that it's a liberal guy that did the shooting etc and they think that's clever and I get that that is interesting strategy if you're a pathetic pathological liar who likes to waste people's time while we're looking for a mass murderer okay and if you think that that's a fun game okay mission accomplished nice job okay but there is no equivalent of that on the left there are monsters in the world and they're almost exclusively on the right wing side you're not going to hear that in the mainstream media because they're too scared to tell you the truth but look at it over and over and over again who are the ones lying who are the ones making things up who are the ones distracting the authorities who are the ones wrongly accusing people the right wing the right wing the right wing again here so when it comes to Facebook and according to the New York Times an official safety check page for the Las Vegas shooting prominently displayed a post from a site called alt-right news the post incorrectly identified the shooter and described him as a trump hating liberal some users saw a story on a trending topic page on Facebook for the shooting that was published by a sputnik a news agency controlled by the Russian government the story's headline claimed incorrectly that the FBI had linked the shooter to daesh terror group also known as Isis by the way right-wing enjoy your Russian comrades so you guys are thinking along similar lines Putin wants us to go right-wing and love Trump you want us to go right-wing and love Trump so wait awake way to work for the Russians you must be so proud I remember decades of right-wingers talking about all Democrats there with the Russians Democrats aren't tough enough on the Russians now you're this Russians bitch so how do you like them apples so I I just want to make a quick comment about the link to Isis because Isis did claim responsibility I mean now this guy wasn't linked to Isis at all but Isis still claimed responsibility for it which I thought was interesting still don't know what his motive was he didn't leave a note behind as far as we know so far you know why so sometimes the shooters or the guys who were doing the killings especially in Europe are linked to Isis and sometimes they have no links at all and so the Orlando shooter who had a lover inside the the gay nightclub that he shot up happen to be Muslim before he went on he didn't want to say I'm gay and I'm bitter and I shot up the place so he said oh yeah sure I'm doing it because I'm Muslim and Isis jumped all over and and there everybody the right way helped him helped Isis by propagating that he worked with Isis when there was actually no evidence that he in any way took a tangible step with Isis or work with them and our authorities say that right so Isis thought they'll give us credit for anything what does it matter if the guy's Muslim or like a Patek yeah sure he did it for Isis and the right ways like yes let me help Isis more by propagating so I think that's relevant because just because Isis wants to claim responsibility I mean they want to take credit you know that's like a badge of honor for them they're proud of that and the right wing is their best friend when they that's right exactly so anytime they claim responsibility it doesn't mean that that individual was linked to Isis alright and then finally a Google Facebook all of them they're saying no it's our algorithm issue we're working on it we're working on it okay whatever your algorithm sucks and obviously you can't I mean these are the the best and brightest engineers and coders and people in tech you could ever imagine and they still can't figure out how to avoid these stories going viral I actually don't agree with that and so look and I think and so I think it is and by the way let me just put my copy of interests out there okay so we we have we're partners with Google and Facebook so it's fair to point that out okay and I'm doing I'm pointing it out but look you the New York Times article makes a great point the algorithm and they have to use that algorithm there's not sick there there's not sixty billion people on the earth to collate all these search results okay they must use an algorithm so when they use an algorithm even if have humans who are then going to correct it there is some period of time between the algorithm picking in that a new story up and putting it to the top and a human coming goes oh my god no that's not a legitimate news story taking it off and the four chance of the world or the people at 4chan who specifically did this go yeah see that's a good way to game the system and there's an extra trick in there they then turn around and blame Google and Facebook and Twitter and all these other things for it and they help to destroy the Internet because you know what people Nero times race the stories are good stories got all the facts right etc okay then the rest of the media picks it up and goes you see that you got to do something about shutting down Facebook and Google not shutting them down completely but we got to get in there and we got to suppress them a little bit etc well you know our legislators want to go in and and start regulating social media to prevent the spread of fake news but you know you have legitimate concerns when it comes to that because Pew Research found that two-thirds of Americans get some of their news at least some of their news from social media and social media is incredibly powerful in pushing out information that politicians don't like and that the mainstream media refuses to report and so does Congress have an interest in you know squashing that as much as possible absolutely and so I'm very cognizant of that and I'm concerned about that as well but that being said this is a real issue and I think one of the biggest problems is that the country lacks media literacy being able to tell the difference between a legitimate news source and an illegitimate news source and then even not conversations gets conversation gets very tricky because what if an independent legitimate and credible news source emerges and since it doesn't have any name recognition recognition does it mean that people just think oh this is not legitimate no but that's exactly right Anna so mainstream media and television is the best friend for people in power they they had gatekeepers that strictly controlled and if you criticize the establishment you will be removed from television so we've seen it happen over and over again and it literally happened to me and I somebody the the guy who runs MSNBC told me to my face so I know what for fact so when they see a story like this they're like perfect the Internet's killing us Facebook and Google are eating our lunch so this is a great opportunity to attack them and they regain power and so those guys that did this whether it's on 4chan or anywhere else they think that it's funny and they get to use the internet and they my guess is they love the internet like we do right but what they don't know is you're doing untold damage to the Internet because you're letting the establishment then turn around and go the internet is not trustworthy it's filled with fake news let's figure out a way to reduce its power shut it down regulate it and make sure you take the freedoms away so that Ana you're right this is an incredibly difficult issue it is real there is fake news out there it does the see people but there's no easy answers and and and I think that the solutions that I am very afraid of the solutions that Congress is gonna come up with and what the rest of the media is going to suggest to make sure that competitors don't get the upper hand on them help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm slash join
