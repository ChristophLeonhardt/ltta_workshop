hello in welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle have you ever known a hero well here you'll meet one also what is the future of the transatlantic alliance in the era of Trump and the prehistory of the next war in the Middle East crosstalking resistance I'm joined by my guest mark Sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst and we have Dimitri babajis the political analyst with Sputnik International all right gentlemen crosstalk girls in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want gentlemen we have a special guest on the program today and I want to talk about this the level of dissent in the United States and the West in general and freedom of speech and here he is we're joined by Ray McGovern in Washington he's a former CIA analyst and co-founder of veterans intelligence professionals for sanity ray thank you for joining us here I think most of the viewers of this program know that what has happened to you when you were at the congressional hearings to get through Donald Trump's nominee for the head of the CIA can you follow up on what's happened to you what were you you were charged what were you charged with and what happens now well I was charged with resisting arrest and also disrupting Congress I will have to appear in court on the 24th I think it is of may and face those charges so who knows what will happen hopefully the judge will have looked at the videotape and see how how ironic it is that I should be charged with resisting arrest when so to speak I was not under my own power in being dragged out of there one thing that people don't realize is that Senator Richard burr yes whose hand and glove with the intelligence people are supposed to be supervising he started the meeting by saying now we're an open session now we're going to executive session but there will be people who need to make a statement all I say to them is do it quickly do it fast and then be gone I said to myself wow that's the first time I've heard a chairman invite somebody could stay true I said that was part of what I thought would be okay if I made a short statement and then be gone and it turned out that they made sure that I be gunned not under my own power but Ray what was what was interesting for me watching the video of you being assaulted is that here we were there was an hearing on a woman that there is ample evidence that she was involved in brutalizing and torturing people and and then at the same time you were being brutalized and I don't think it's unfair for me to say I think you're you're 78 years old I watched that video a number of times I could not see how you could have possibly been a threat to those police officers and you didn't look like you were resisting you know II respect to the fact you're being forced on the ground you thought at the time you may be that your arm had been dislocated and there seemed to be no interest other than a few people videotaping it here watching brutalization in public so you know it seems to be brutalization seems to be the themes of the time right well you know go ahead mark go ahead and ask a question yeah I have to say ray you look pretty good generally for a 70 year old got a 78 year old guy a 24-year veteran of the you know of as a CIA analyst but you're looking a little worse for the wear I see your glasses are still broken could you show us your hands ray yeah those are those are real doozies a job on me the u.s. police state here's my prison well you know yeah we have to sort of keep our sense of you my youngest daughters when she saw the picture of my glasses she dad how did they make your right ear down so low how did they bring the ear down so low let's talk about the level of dissent here because I mean what you were you were invited by the chairman of that committee as a member of the public to express an opinion but you were not allowed to do that so what does this tell you about the level of dissent in freedom of speech in the US I mean these hearings are very important Jena bloody Jena probably will get the get through and be a place that's head of CIA so what about dissent remember where you heard it first beater she's not going to be approved okay there enough decent people in the united states are storming two senators she's not going to be be confirmed so yeah it was set up those guys were all ready to pounce on me i took advantage of the fact that one of them moved away from the front so i could get at least a sentence and but you saw the rest of what happened so what we have here is a committee that's supposed to be an oversight committee see what the russian what the what the CIA is doing but it's a richard burr and it's the kind of overlooked committee yeah and their hand in glove with the that with the intelligence people are supposed to be overseeing or monitoring do you wanna jump in there well i think that it's just all for what happened but unfortunately it's a part of a trend i mean there are hundreds of people so-called whistleblowers in the united states on the no-fly list and a lot of them were subjected to similar treatment in in europe Mattel's p skorsky the Polish citizen he has been in jail for two years without trial simply for giving interviews to the Russian media saying things which the Polish mainstream does not accept in Latvia Alexander Capone anchor who was also a frequent on RT and activist for the Russian minority in what way he has been arrested a few day two weeks ago and no Western media not a single Western media outlet reported about it I'm pretty sure this story with ray is not going to be picked up by the mainstream media that's the table brings up great Dima brings up a really interesting point because you know you III saw a couple of comments in the mainstream media you know very small margin marginal comments but alternative media and social media picked up on your story like a vengeance I mean it's all over Facebook right now I made an announcement on Facebook did you be on this program the positive reaction was so overwhelming it really made me happy that people are that people do know about this story here and you're not gonna learn about it from the mainstream media well that's a major major point here that's the back story and I grew up in in New York first 22 years of my life I went to school there I went to you versity there and i have lots of friends that are still looking at the grass firm from on top okay they're still around now when I go back to college reunions and I say blah blah blah they say write what you learned that I said what you mean oh well it's not in the New York Times yeah that's how bad it is it's not in the New York Times and of course I didn't expect to be in New York Times nor was I Washington Post Wall Street Journal so it's really encouraging that this is goes viral among people who feel the same way we do for the most part but it's I guess the main story in my view is that nobody knows why I did what I did and what I did was quite within my rights Ron Wyden the senator had asked Gina Haspel were you there in Thailand did you supervise the waterboarding of al-nashiri and she said senator that's classified yeah and he said I'm at a time now why is it classified well senator I classified it she so she she classified so let's let's make sure our viewers under saying she classified information about herself okay oh wow there's oversight there not only did she classify it she destroyed evidence right she did which is also a federally even though grad rank even though Ron Wyden run white and ran out of time right so he couldn't follow up but here's the chair right and he knows that every one of those senators know that sure she did supervise the waterboarding around the shiri at that black site in Thailand everyone knows that okay so why didn't he intervene why didn't he say now miss Haspel we have the documents of course so you say they're secret but it's a little odd that you should be allowed to classify these so would you answer yes or no well you're there when he was waterboarding of course you would have to say yes so that's the cover-up here that's the other the supreme irony that she can classify and make unavailable to the public to the people who are supposed to be watching what's what person this is it's nominated to be the head of the CIA I mean this is an open hearing is to inform the American people hich is no no I'm sorry that's classic that I can't it that's quite senator that's classified apparently gentlemen her her nickname bloody Gina number one apparently she kind of like the nickname and number two there are reports that she enjoyed that kind of enhanced arrogation I mean this is kind of a reflection of a mindset nice nice nicknames these people have the defenders of democracy mad dog bloody Gina they are going to defend democracy 100% can you imagine someone at the Nuremberg trial you know that the German Nazis were there accused of torturing people can you imagine Goering saying I can't tell you if I did this this is classified you know they would say that they were fighting communism what they never do resisting Jewish onslaught but they would never say it was classified it's as if Nuremberg never happened I mean this is what happens to a 24 year veteran of the CIA when he protests against a torturer and war criminal let's be clear Jena hospital is a war criminal for not wanting a torturer to be the director of the CIA and it's not the first time we've seen this type of brutality of course I mean we all remember Occupy Wall Street pepper spray cop Ferguson black lives matter anti Keystone XL anti Dakota pipelines we've seen this again but but Ray I'm glad that you I'm trying to keep a sense of humor and I've got a couple Twitter quotes for you in that vein Jeremy Scahill whom I I'm sure you know as well as I do Ben Geena Haspel is waterboarding the glass ceiling because you know in America at least at least women have the equal rights to torture in 30 seconds Gina Haspel says she worked very hard and sometimes even slept on the floor of her CIA station that must have been torture from Danielle Ryan Irish journalist well gentlemen I'm glad we're making light of this and I'm really glad that Rey is okay but again it seems to me this is a sign of time the times that we have a person that is obviously committed egregious illegal acts immoral acts I was I was this I found it galling that she even talked about repeatedly the morality of what the CIA does quite remarkable all right gentlemen I'm gonna jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on some real news stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Belt remind you we're discussing some real news okay gentlemen let's change gears here a fascinating article came out and Spiegel Online titled time for Europe to join the resistance here of course this is a reaction to Donald Trump's decision to move to leave the Iran deal which is a multilateral treaty that was supervised and signed under the auspices of United Nations Security Council so it is not the a bilateral agreement as it is betrayed in Western media here mark I thought it was interesting the title time for Europe to join the resistance I would say that's a bit too late but you know they might try and go ahead I mean Europe was a member of the resistance before the resistances you know existed as European leaders you know had a problem with Donald Trump during his election campaign and now they've they initially when he took office they tried various attempts to butter up to him and to try to in the most embarrassing way in the most embarrassing way but yeah they obviously are invested in in this deal with Iran and they have good reason to be u.s. trade with Iran last year was 200 million dollars the EU trade with Iran was 25 billion dollars right so that that tells you that there are there are vested interests there other than you know just preventing a war in conflagration across across the Middle East but you know I I have problem believing that the EU will stick by their guns we've seen them I mean bow down before even when Obama was was wiretapping Angela Merkel's phone but the reason the reason why they let me go to Ray in Washington one of the reasons why the you know using the term resistance is all nice and fine but what power do they have to resist there's not much there and this is a result of them abrogating their own security interests their own borders I would say and and going along with American postmodernists of social theory I mean they've just essentially castrated themselves now they're angry and upset but they're defenseless more or less go ahead ray well they have castrated themselves and the question really is Peter its seventy-three years since the end of the war now I lived in Germany for five years I know Germans and I know the younger generation for which there is grill hope but the notion that after the war the Germans would act like well like juveniles or adolescents and always bowed to to the winners of the war I mean that's 73 years when are they going to grow up and act like adults when their own economic and other interests are concerned I think this may be the time because never before have we had a certifiable crazy person in charge of Washington the it's quite a pass when the when the restraining influence has to be exerted by a guy who likes to be called Mad Dog Mad Dog Madison okay so you have a situation here which is new and I don't rise to the occasion now I won't see Europe acting as an independent entity in my lifetime deema III I agree with Ray but I think it's far too late to mean they would have to I mean when you have these globalist elites are so integrated I mean that is assuming that Merkel McCrone and may actually have a lot of power I don't think they do and actually and they all they're certainly out of touch with their electorates okay well they just drugged Syria together with Trump and he wasn't mad and they were proud about it you know macarons said it was a matter of Honor for the for Europe to go along with Trump like against Syria so in order to resist the main problem is not having the financial power to do it the main program is having the morale the moral right to do it Europe went along with every action against Iran and against many other Middle Eastern countries in the last thirty years so when when they're speaking rights that in Trump's Washington the only thing that matters is dismantling the legacy peaceful legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama religiously peaceful well yes what huh exactly huh you know country's Barnack Abama said that she has all the Oh because she's got a Nobel Peace Prize right that was only nine countries is peaceful first president Raney want to jump in go ahead yeah I just point out that there was the Iraq war I and Gerhard schröder said no you know now he said no and then of course he he let the US used all his bases and everything else in Germany but he did say no inside of the French so there is some hope here I mean situation is really different than ever before you have people who are not fully in possession of their faculties running our country and running the Alliance so to speak you have places like turkey drifting away from NATO Montenegro I don't think that really suffers substitutes for turkey so this is a time of flux and if the you know sadly in Germany you have Austria in charge of the Foreign Ministry and fund a lion you know how did defense minister fund a lion I get to be defense minister for the lion she lies all the time raid that permit for me is if it's like I I agree on the economics thing I mean you know of course the Europeans would be afraid of being sanctioned by the United States they they're more than willing to give up on their own national interests we've seen this for 30 years this this is a pattern here but that for me it there's the dimension of leadership there's a huge leadership gap we don't have we don't have a de Gaulle okay we don't have a Margaret Thatcher I mean at least she had a vision you could agree or disagree with it but she had a vision I would even say Helmut Kohl had a vision for Europe I don't see any of these characters now have a vision for Europe they've gotten so used to taking orders from Washington and now we have this situation where we have not just a president we have Mike Pompeo we have john bolton and we're gonna have bloody Gina I'm sorry I wouldn't disagree with that I think she's to make a good team you want to jump in there well I just wanted to say that when I read in der Spiegel clever resistance is necessary necessary as sad and absurd as that may sound resistance against America and of so hero it's so euro it's weak it is moaning if snowflake nonsense here it's too late it's been rated the first time I have a problem with the term resistance we can't even talk about the US Democrats since they approved a sanctions bill that not only targeted Russia North Korea and Syria but also targeted Iran while this agreement was still in effect so I mean which would seem to be a breach of it into my mind at least and in many others I think the EU will just wait Donald Trump out there problems with him is mostly partisan and ideological if this was Hillary Clinton leading the charge in the dissolution of this agreement she'd be holding their hand and they'd be going along you're assuming Trump's as a one-term president okay well we'll make that assumption I'll make that assumption well Mac rod this week when faced with the possibility that a US may put tariffs and sanctions on European companies if they do business with Iran now he said what are we America's vassal to which my reply is we yeah yeah you are Merkel Merkel said we can no longer rely on the US for our defense too late yeah Angela I hate to tell you something honey but uh the biggest threat to your sovereignty and security is the u.s. okay you know you know ray one of the interesting things is that we have the Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran deal but what's really quite remarkable is that we hear from the State Department even though the United States is no longer a member of this multilateral treaty we expect the Iranians to comply with the treaty I mean there's so many different dimensions right there that don't make any sense why did the United States leave if they're in compliance and we don't want a party party up to that agreement but you must being still in it you must comply the the rank hypocrisy of all it's it's so illogical okay how can countries around the world look at the United States as a reasonable actor now yeah well the Peter is giving hypocrisy a bad name let's face it but it's not the first time I want it I want to introduce a factor here that's overwhelming significance and which is never never mentioned it is major speech on 1 March the president poutine talked about a growing very very substantial alliance in effect with country named China okay no I earned my Spurs analyzing the sino-soviet dispute when they were loggerheads when they were fighting military clashes against their riverine borders I know what that was like in my short lifetime I've seen a complete change if there's trouble if China supports Russian policy in Syria and in Ukraine if there's trouble in either of those places mark my words you're gonna have trouble in the South China Sea in the Taiwan Straits that's how close the military alliances witness the fact that the Chinese newly appointed Defense Minister the first thing he did was travel to Moscow they asked him why he said because I want to express my solidarity what the Russians are doing in in this era of challenge so that's a new element and that is something that I've been trying to get into the press about now because I don't think I don't think Mad Dog Madison think Trump I don't think bolted they don't know that they're proceeding from the old paradigm where after the war in 91 in Iran a croc the main lesson was we can do these things and the Russians won't stop us well the Russians are not alone now the Russians and the Chinese can stop us yes but another historical analogy ray considering what you just said about China visa vie Ukraine and Syria August 1914 okay they the the possibility of these inter connecting Alliance systems getting out of control and escalation to go ahead mark got its own interests I mean after Russia Iran is the biggest supplier of energy to the Chinese industrial you know economic machine so right they've got their own interests and it with with Iran thirty-seconds demon you know when people say that economy is so important okay China is following its economic logic which mark has described just very well here Europe despite the fact that they trade with Iran to the tune of twenty five billion a year just look how easily they destroyed their relationship with Russia it it cost them a lot more it was them at least 100 billion Rice's dollars four times more than with the wrong and they still went ahead with it despite the fact that Russia was no threat no further talking can you spell castration okay gentlemen that's all the time we have many thanks to my guests here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our youtube channel see you next time remember crosstalk rules okay now for the extended version of our program we have political potpourri deema your first what's on your mind well Ukraine you know last week the ukrainian President poroshenko had a meeting with two other participants of the so-called Normandy formant which is supposed to bring peace to Ukraine he had meetings with Angela Merkel and Francois sorry I'm on Omicron of France they did not invite President Putin he was not there so the Normandy format is part of the Normandy exam Russia is part of that format but he was not invited so they said it was just a preparatory meeting for the visits of macaron and and probably Merkel to Russia in the end of May and poroshenko announced he would like a Normandy format meeting in the beginning of June well the reason why there is so much attention paid to that is because the situation gets more and more dangerous deema unfortunately I have this really bad feeling that we're gonna be reporting on Ukraine a lot in the very nearest future mark what's on your mind yeah I think the most unconsidered thing in the in the past week is with these Israeli strikes on Syria which were the most significant strikes on Syria in Cynthiana Israel gates this is I believe a a planned phase lead-up to war with Iran because the excuse that Israel made for this attack and we have to remember that in since 2011 Israel has attacked Syria illegally aggressively more than 100 times right and their excuse this time was they were hitting Iranians previously they've used the excuse of Hezbollah now they're attacking Iranians because we all know that Syria doesn't have sovereignty and isn't allowed the right to choose their own allies at least according to the US Israel and its allies and I believe that this is a phased escalation and escalatory ladder that will lead Netanyahu wants to lead the US with the neo cons and the the Trump administration all too willing into war with Iran okay let me ask Trey that question it what do you think about that I mean I said in the last edition of cross luck that the US administration in league with its allies in the region Israel Saudi Arabia etc this is all a preamble to a larger escalate escalating military scenario that is targeting Iran I mean with your experience is that is that a reasonable conclusion to draw it's a very reasonable and frightening conclusion the only saving grace the only positive here would be a fellow named Mad Dog Madison ow he loves Wars but only wars that he can win okay now like his predecessor one of his predecessors a Mike Mullen who is chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff this has happened before the Israelis have ginned up and manufactured evidence before about the Iranians cheating the Iranians aren't cheating so the question is will Netanyahu be able to persuade the likes of mattis that there has to be a war with Iran I mean what would Iran would make war with Iraq look like a volleyball game between two girls high schools for God's sake this is serious not to not to even speak of the refugees that would pour into into Europe so there's a lot of incentive for Madison to say look I'm not gonna win this war we haven't won a war actually since let's see about 73 years ago I guess I'm not gonna I'm not gonna send my guys up the cliffs there at the Persian Gulf so I think that there is a reasonable prospect that Netanyahu will be shown to be the liar that he is the evidence then that their little slideshow that's all stuff we know 20 years ago and has deep been debunked because it was manufactured by whom Mossad right right you know teaming when I look at this here I was a very strong opponent of the the 2003 invasion of Iraq I mean right before it I kept asking people why why now where's the evidence looking at the media how they ginned up their story we have Mossad we at the CIA we had john bolton and other people like that it's happening all over again right in front of our eyes it's happening all over because not a single person was actually brought to justice not a single person in the pentagon was demoted not a single journalist who wrote all of these basically deceitful articles about the weapons of mass destruction none of them was their job who's still on TV shortly but I also I wanted to continue what Mark said there was a very interesting event that happened last week again unnoticed by the Western media there was an election in Lebanon which Hezbollah won in alliance with their partner Amal and with a few Christian Christian organizations exactly serene Christians allied with Hezbollah Americans who don't understand I'm glad you underline that part you know do you have Hezbollah and you have Christian sects political parties lined with Hezbollah so they win the democratic election have you forgotten about the cedar revolution in Lebanon you know when the pro American forces were supposed to be the only legitimate the only popular force in Lebanon that is all gone that is all forgotten they no longer pay attention to their elections in Lebanon there are now busy with Syria with Iran but actually the story of Lebanon is coming to a close basically what happened in the beginning of the 2000s was an attempt by the United States and the European Union to have a regime change there that the person who became the prime minister South Korea cracked up to be basically a hostage to the Sun literally literally and politically and now Hezbollah has won an honest election period that's the end of them but I think let me go back to terrain in Washington I'm really glad that Dima ba bitch brought up this point here because from Tel Aviv's perspective all the puzzle pieces are coming together I mean we had a member of the Knesset saying Hezbollah equals Lebanon equals Hezbollah we know what that means in the mindset of the Israeli political and military elites and we have this more than just violent rhetoric we have a shooting war with the Israelis the striking Iranian assets that have been invited legally by the Syrian government in Syria here is Israel gonna connect these two two birds for one the two birds for one stone I mean that's what it's beginning to look like you know there are a couple of factors here we haven't discussed and one is President Putin yep he's got this relationship with Netanyahu he's been able to call off the dogs of war in the past similarly I think mattis will be doing what Admiral Mike Mullen did back in 2007-2008 going to the Israelis and saying look you know don't try a false flag attack Cheney you may remember had boats painted with Iranian colors and they were gonna shoot one of our warships in the Persian Gulf now that didn't get approved finally it's one of the few things he didn't get approved but it's very easy for Israel to mount a false flag attack against an American ship blame whomever and we're off and running so Mike Mullen to his credit went to Tel Aviv and he said look we remember what happened to the USS Liberty yep you remember that yep that's when the Israelis shot up the Liberty trying to sink it and kill 32 US sailors wounded 137 okay so there's the first time any american statesman or military official hye-won went to the israelis and we remember that don't try that again now is mattis capable of that I think he is because he doesn't want to start a war that he can't win mark yeah maybe you couldn't do the Russian angle here yeah because I you know I know this is something you're worried a president putin has tried to prevent this conflict from blowing up into a direct war between major great powers between Russia the United States and Israel so it's obvious they cut another deal with yet you net Yahoo was in Moscow he spent 10 hours of face time with Putin on victory day he was the guest of honor as it were of these celebrations and and watch again Russia is waffling on delivering the s-300 but I'm a little worried about this because both US and Israeli attacks on Syria and are not decreasing they're escalating both in in frequency in scale and in the depth in which they're penetrating Syria so I'm afraid that Russia may not be able to walk this line of not choosing sides any longer and it's speaking of choosing sides if this thing goes down it's not just gonna be Lebanon Hezbollah they're automatically gonna be draw it in this the US would be they've already taken a stance with Saudi Arabia against the Shia world now they would be at war with the Shia world you know not a Hezbollah the Houthis in Yemen Iraq the Iraqi people certainly wouldn't send they'd be another war in Iraq on top of the war with Iran but I don't think the evidence is ray says is needed you know this weapons of mass destruction we've heard it again and again and again and that's what they're using this time around who evidence we know isn't needed the Washington free beacon had a report out this week on a white paper presented to the US National Security Council they by the SSG group this is obviously what they're at least considering White House examines plan to help Iranian people oppose regime subtitled white paper pushes brief to help Iranians talk you know gentlemen we run out of time it's really interesting if we look at all the white papers and all of the media go back to 2003 all they've done is change one letter from q2n all right gentlemen that's all the time we have I hope you've enjoyed this political potpourri we'll see you next time and remember crosstalk rules you
