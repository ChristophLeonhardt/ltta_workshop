I'm as Rula van it's May 7th and you're watching battleground hey welcome back it's our second week of our testing out the daily chit chat that's not the official name the official name is super chat is where we get to talk back and forth you can make comments I respond in real-time the super chat part is you get to have a special comment that is pinned to the top and bright highlighter color if you want me to ask it it's a great way for me to get questions and comments from our viewers and have a lighter show than my daily 8 p.m. Eastern Time show today we're gonna cover some great ground I saw a speech on the weekend by count dank EULA that's the online nickname of a Scott who was prosecuted and convicted for making a joke about his girlfriend's dog being a Nazi it was a crazy case but his speech was so eloquent I've got a clip of that for you we're also going to talk about Rosie O'Donnell making a bunch of different political contributions from different addresses using different versions of her name breaking us donation law I also have some interesting security camera footage from Germany to show you oh that plus taking your questions I see people are chit-chatting already on the side of the screen that's how you do it there's obviously too many comments for me to get through all of them but if you want your sustained oh you can chip in a couple of bucks get your comment up there the other day someone chipped in 50 we do this for fun and we do this also as a way to help us pay our bills alright without further to do let me get straight to the first story today and it's count dank EULA that's it's such a silly name and the fella he's a little alternative looking as you can see by his various piercings and that ought to be your first tip-off that he's got a certain sense of humor and anyways over the weekend he was at the so called day for freedom that our friend Tommy Robinson was organizing in the UK at Whitehall which is a prestigious address thousands of Brits showed up for a series of speeches I haven't had a chance to look at any of the other speeches other than count dank you I hope to make time to watch as many of them as I can Gavin McInnes flew all the way there from New York Rahim Kassim from Breitbart Lauren southern I'm trying to think of others who were there I can't think of him off the top my head but the only one I did watch was Camden Kela he was about 10 minutes long I was so impressed I thought he would be a jokester maybe I thought maybe he would just be a regular guy who was swooped up with us I was not expecting a smart funny persuasive articulate passionate speech that was also at the same time very reasonable I I mean like I said I haven't watched the others so I can't say this was the best of the day but I was blown away by it actually it was the best ten minutes I watched I encourage you to find it online I'd like to share with you about two minutes of his speech near the end he talked about like he said he used to be a leftist everyone everyone was except for me and he reminds there was some anti protesters a handful of professional protesters there against this day for freedom and he had a reminder to them that if you wish to invest the state the government with vast powers of censorship you better hope that your party is always in power because imagine said counting kula if you're a leftist activist who believes in censorship for your enemies but then whoopsies your enemies suddenly seized power through a democratic election I presume and now they have those very tools to use against you let's hear the count say it much more eloquently I want to roll about two minutes but keep your patience and I think you'll be engrossed in and you'll wish I played more take a look but if someone wants to take freedom of speech an intel says far-right my people live even Brandi disobeyed as a farm right heaven because of what if I clear the speaker's here but then whether the webqueen free speech events whether the length point is covered in support of free speech the reason these speakers are you today as a because the REA have claimed the principle of these speech is because the left have abandoned them freedom of speech is not a great wing gold and it's not a left wing go it's a human goal as a human great that everyone deserves it doesn't matter what race you are it doesn't matter what religion you are it doesn't matter where you're from and it's a great that we all must protect because it belongs to all of us these speeches and all by the way as a Cohen by the led by an organization today and then they are far left groups in favor of placing restrictions of what people cannot can't see I was actually one of you once many many years ago and back then one of the things that we took played and was home anti-establishment we will and one of the last things that we would ever have done as a load for the government to have more power I hope things have changed the reason that we would have never have liked the government to have control of something is because we all knew when it comes to the government you give them control in one thing and it never ends there they will keep going and going until they control as much as they possibly counted and that was one of the most important lessons that we learned and influence that the decision that we made and to see this new generation hey welcome back sorry I'm who's getting grossed in the comments that people were making as we were playing that there's Count Chocula I loved it and thanks to Al Ezz who uploaded that video from and like I said I have another chance to watch the others I was just sorry I was I was distracted I was looking at some of the comments that were coming through um just answer some of them I understand that Lauren southern was not there in person she's being banned from the UK so her speech was by video you could see there was a big video screen next to count Acula Tommy Robinson obviously spoke Tommy was with the rebel for about a year but he left on good terms to go independent were obviously still huge fans of his morally and so we think he's doing great so I will I would imagine that I'm gonna try and make time to watch I'm curious what Gavin McInnes said he's just such a hoot and he brings a half Canadian half from American perspective anyways I thought that was great I also note how little coverage that got in the mainstream media our own Katie Hopkins put out a tweet saying thousands of people marching for freedom in the heart of London BBC silent on the subject and at that point it was true I did not see any BBC coverage of it I will have to look and see but of course they wouldn't I mean first of all I was a very diverse group of people diverse ethnically racially religiously there was even some drag queens I mean there was gays against Sharia so it's the kind of thing that the BBC like our own CBC in Canada or the name of time for the PBS and the states would not want to cover because it just breaks the narrative too much the narrative is only hateful right wingers use free speech and the shame about that is free speech is for everybody it's it's for anyone on the idea spectrum I mean George wet or well I wouldn't particularly call him right-wing and he talked about freedom very deeply in the 60s and 70s to the left sort of took free speech ownership of it the ACLU became famous for it it's not so much that the right is saying free speech is a right wing thing they're saying jeez you lefties don't want it that's the treasure of the West we'll take it you should have it too but we'll take it anyways it's quite something that is the first clip of the day we've got a few other things I want to cover while we're talking about Europe let me show you some closed-circuit footage from I've found this online I haven't independently verified it but I've seen it referred to enough that I'm willing to proceed on that basis that this seems accurate to me I've seen in various sites can we play the b-roll while I comment on it so this is apparently in a drugstore in Germany or a convenience store and there is a migrant from Muslim country I don't know Syria whatnot just coming in and going through the liquor store and just smashing the liquor I don't know if that's wine or hard liquor just smashing it prohibition-style because don't you know it's against sure not a drink and he's just giving her I mean how many is he smashed already by Ben 20 he's grabbing two in each hand boom boom boom this looks like it's being filmed and someone's finally accosting him a shopkeeper a costume the shopkeepers probably wised that old boom there's six at once shopkeepers probably wise to personally intervene against a madman why bother getting smashed up and cut up for a few hundred bucks worth these he runs back around the corner this looks like it's someone filming a closed-circuit security TV oh there's someone who finally says it looks like a cop I think or maybe private security someone who finally says yeah you've smashed up mmm close to a thousand dollars versus worth of liquor now we're gonna take you away do you really think he was here he is coming in this is the very beginning part again I guess it's on a loop here do you really think that he was charged I'm sure he was charged you really think he was sentenced in any meaningful way I'm rather skeptical that he was but yeah I mean come on Germany don't you know that alcohol is Haram that means it's against the laws of Allah and when you bring in 1 2 3 4 5 million migrants what's the number in Germany now does anyone even really know it's something like they track these things don't you know that you will soon have alcohol free zones it's just the same way you will have other things banished including gays and Jews and I know that sounds dramatic but I remember when I went to Rosengard the all Muslim neighborhood of Malmo Sweden once what's a very powerful strong hard-working blue-collar industrial town in the south of Sweden it's about 50% Muslim but it's not 50% it's in every other house it's a Muslim area a no-go zone we only went there with heavy security and I encountered I think I might have told you this story before I encountered a young Muslim man whose mom was wearing the full ninja the full niqab and this young Swedish Muslim told me he was born in Sweden so he's not a migrant who has failed to assimilate Swedish values born in Sweden attended Swedish schools spoke very good English as most Swedes do he also spoke Swedish and I presume he spoke another Persian or Arabic language I don't know and we had a very friendly chat you could find this on YouTube I went there but a year or two ago and he said I asked him about Swede known for being liberal and gay rights and things like that and he said yeah yeah but not in our Muslim areas he wanted to ban alcohol not for the Christian areas but just for just for the Muslim enclaves like Rosengard and he wanted to ban homosexuals from holding hands in public he was fine with being gay just not anywhere near the Muslim parts where he said Sharia law should run and the thing is that sounds crazy just like that guy smashing the liquor store looked crazy and it is crazy when you first see it but then when the population is 50% Muslim and let's say half of that is Sharia compliant it's not so crazy anymore and then when you're in Rosengard and it's 90% plus Muslim it's not crazy anymore it's the law either the law Sharia law that's enforced de facto or it's just the law of economics people are sick of having their liquor stores smashed up and they just move god forbid there's a synagogue or a coach or store or restaurant they just move not that they're formerly bandits why would you stick around I think I've told you before when I spent the day in Rosengard I saw only one sweetest face the whole time I was there other than a few security guards who were stuck defending this totally is Lama fide shopping center so yeah I know that looks absurd and you might be thinking well that's just a goofy thing that could happen anywhere no that is exactly what happens when you bring a critical mass of Sharia compliant men into an area who say well geez this is the law of Allah and I'm now going to apply it as a soldier of Allah against the infidels why is that in any way surprising I want to remind you what we're doing here we are chit-chatting I'm gonna read a few comments if you want your comment highlighted in a bright color and stuck to the top and I and I'll get to it for sure because I'll see it out of the corner of my eye you can click on the super chat and it's a couple bucks or so and it makes it stand out and there's friendly way to support us if you feel like doing that I see no super chats so I'm just gonna read some I'm just gonna read some comments in general I've got to pick some out here private Alex Brown says private security have their hands tied bylaws if they weren't you'd see these kinds of people breaking bottles shot dead well I disagree with you I don't think that there's a need to shoot someone dead for smashing bottles I think that's an overreaction frankly I don't think that's the German Way or the British Way or the Canadian American Way but I think that that you there ought to be a criminal penalty and if that person was not a German citizen and very likely he wasn't you have to be deported over that why John Zeeland says why has Trudeau now calling right-wingers terrorists well it's funny you mentioned that I saw a story on global today written by Stuart Bell who did an access to information request of CSIS that's Canada's version of the CIA and the political wing of our government the political branch our public security department run by the Liberal Minister Ralph Goodale wanted to say that the threat of right-wing terrorism was acute or extreme or growing or growing rapidly and CSIS that is the actual you know CIA type cops kept on saying on what factual basis on what facts that kept pushing back and saying there is no evidence for this and yet the statement was edited and edited and edited and in the end the actual police were gagged and the propaganda police were the ones that had their way so it was very interesting that of course Justin Trudeau wants to be able to say that there's right-wing violence in this country because that suits his narrative the fact is there isn't I have never heard an instance of alt-right violence in Canada I accept that the mass murder of the Quebec City mosque I accept his confession that he was personally motivated by his fears of refugees and Muslims and terrorism I accept that but to say that there is a organized permanent perpetual critical mass of any sort of right-wing terrorism is simply false and by the way I should point out that that murderer Alessandra Pisa net was not charged with either hate crime or terrorism as police and and other evidence came forward he was actually mentally ill and on severe medication so bad was he mentally that he had moved back in with his parents my point is there simply is no right wing terrorism in Canada but Trudeau so desperately wants it because he wants to use not only does he want to set off against actual Muslim terrorism which is unfortunately becoming common in Canada but he wants to use all the trappings of the state all the power of the state all the instruments at his fingertips to attack regular conservatives by claiming they're part of some grand violent conspiracy that's my answer to your question let me Jake Greene says Ezra have you heard of the calorie plan mate no I don't know what that is I feel closest I've heard of his Calgary which is the city where I'm from Luciana tardy Juncker says what was going on in Toronto last night with the army moving in off the Gardiner Expressway I do not know the answer to that but you've got my curiosity El Chupacabra says need another Diefenbaker well I think you're right I think we need a charismatic truly conservative Canadian leader and I don't think we see that in and Russia right now all right let's take a quick look at the clock it's 1218 where one-third done our time today I want to move on we have another story it's Rosie O'Donnell who fashions herself as Donald Trump's nemesis the celebrity I think I think it's fair to call her celebrity look at this story in the New York Post Rosie O'Donnell's campaign donations to Democrats went over the legal limit and not just in a whoopsies kind of way let me read this first quote to you and you tell me if this sounds like an accident filings show O'Donnell gave a combined five 400 dollars in contributions over the limit to the five candidates but look at this look at this and used five different New York addresses and four variations of her name really now first of all it's it's wonderful to be a leftist anti-capitalist celebrity railing on against capitalism and for socialism when you have five at its is I mean is that not the first thing that jumps out it reminds me of Bernie Sanders and his three addresses David Suzuki is five addresses Al Gore Michael Moore they're all fancy-pants socialist limiting liberals but to make donations from different versions of her name at five different addresses that doesn't sound like a mistake if you ask someone their address they know and maybe they have a real house address that they keep private so they use like a pl box or a you know a manager's address business address but five different addresses five different names five different spellings for five different contributions I'm sorry I think that shows the state of mind that she was deliberately trying to conceal the fact she was making so many donations I just want more one more quote from the New York Post here if 2700 ollars is the cutoff candidates should refundable you know I don't look to see who I can donate most to I just donated assuming they do not accept what is over the limit oh is that how it works is that ours let me read some more O'Donnell says she donates often really really and uses the online liberal fundraising platform act blew my anxiety is quelled by donating to those opposing Trump and his agenda especially at night when most of these were placed well then it's okay isn't it you can break election financing law if you do then to self-medicate oh let me just see out of the corner of my eye you what Kim Jacobson says hi Ezra could you turn up the output of audio the volume is a bit too low great show Ezra the people's here here oh thank you our team got the message so they'll turn up the output thanks for asking back to Rosie O'Donnell you know why this is interesting to me because of course leftists are scofflaws who think the laws only apply to the little people I mean for God's sakes they don't even practice what they preach let alone what other people legislate but one of my conservative heroes Dinesh D'Souza who makes very powerful movies he made a couple of powerful movies about Barack Obama they revealed more about Obama than I think most mainstream media journalists did he's very effective partly because he's a visible minority and so he can take on issues of identity politics and race that the Democrats use and he sort of has a little bit more room to maneuver anyways Dinesh D'Souza made a minor contraband contribution much less than Rosie O'Donnell's overage and he was prosecuted at Great Lengths by the Obama administration and actually put in prison of course he was of course he was because he was a conservative and they had to humiliate him and get the absolute maximum punishment available do you think Rosie O'Donnell will even be charged let alone convicted let alone sentence and imprisoned oh my friends you already know the answer don't you let's take a peek see if there's any more comments and then I want to go to my last story of the day I want to stretch these stories out a bit but I half the fun of this noon time chat and we're still I got to tell you I'm thinking of moving the timeslot because I think our people I eat conservatives I think our people work doing the day and I know 12:00 noon is lunch hour on the eastern time zone but a lot of our folks are in Alberta BC other parts of the states so they're in their morning at work I see some Europeans chiming in I saw someone who said he was from Nottingham England so obviously it's 5:00 p.m. over there it's it's after work I want to I think we might try and do some sort of official survey because if there's a better time of day we'll see if we can do that I don't know if we can do that I know if we can if it suits the work schedule of our office for us to do this at 5:00 p.m. I just want more people to see it that's all and I get the feeling that it's like when conservatives have rallies during the work day no leftist go to daytime rallies because leftist don't work I see another comment by Joshua's court level says Ezra I'm Pro legal immigration and helping refugees but assimilation needs to improve how well that's a great question I think there's two answers to that first of all I think it goes to quantum if you have massive massive numbers of immigration you just can't assimilate because you instantly get ghettos and you get people who have no positive incentive to learn the local language learn the local custom make friends with the local indigenous community and by a digitus I mean Germans and Germany Brits and Britain Canadians in Canada also the certain time I had it was clear welders Holland himself who said to me if you're wearing the full face obscuring niqab how easily are you gonna make friends I mean nothing is more off-putting and nothing says stay away than an actual physical barrier of your face I mean humans of every kind not just Westerners eye contact facial expressions you know that that's how humans interact and to put up put a mask on your face how on earth are you gonna make friends with real Dutchman you're not going to and so you're gonna be ghetto eyes so the first answer to your question is the sheer numbers has to be as you can't assimilate an enormous population and we've read stories about towns in Europe where 50% of the town the 50% of the population had been dumped on them dumped is the word because some central government agency said we're sending 50 migrants there and you have no choice about it the second thing is you have to say well we we have a culture that's worth keeping and coming to Germany or Spain or France or Sweden or Canada or the UK of America means embracing certain things it's not about the color of your skin that's not culture the color skin is not philosophy or a culture or value or history in fact the history of blacks in America goes back centuries so being black has nothing to do with it being Muslim has something to do with only if Islamic law Trump's American law Canadian law or Western law that's why and again I refer to here builders again who makes a clear distinction between Muslims who are people and Islam which is an ideology and the West's you know you might not like to hear it but the history of the West the history of Western civilization is the history of Christianity judeo-christianity if it makes you can feel more comforted but doesn't mean that there's no room for people of different backgrounds Sikhs Hindus whatever Muslims - but the basic DNA of our system from our law to our high trust society to how we treat different people our pluralism how we believe in the Equality of different people including the Equality of men and women non-violence those are Christian ideas and I say that it's a Jew and I say thank God I mean it was this Christian society that let my own family come from Russia in 1903 where they had a more brutal society especially towards Jews the very fact that people want to seek refuge in the West shows that nature of human kindness in the West right so my first point is you have to have some sort of regulation on the quantum of immigrants and the second is you have to know what your values are and what are the non-negotiables there's wonderful things about immigration is anyone who likes to go to a different restaurant or listen to different music or different those aspects of culture those are the wonderful aspects but there are certain parts of foreign cultures that are not wonderful anti-democratic illiberal authoritarian legal systems that don't bear any recognition to ours corruption from low trust societies the treatment of women or other minorities gays religious minorities those are things we have to vet and if you're not willing to say those things stay immigrants don't be surprised if they say well I never knew we did several stories about an immigrant - Canada who was convicted of beating his wife with a hockey stick for half an hour yeah that's not what hockey sticks are for me but he said in the court no one told me that wasn't allowed now don't think for a minute he didn't know what's wrong of course he knew but I do believe that no immigration official no bureaucrat no social worker no politician no diplomat I do believe that no one in authority ever said to him by the way you're in Canada now you cannot beat your wife now even though Sharia law grants you the right to beat your wife it does is you know no one ever in authority told him no I think he was telling the truth there all right let's take a gander meteor hammer says Ezra would it be safe to assume that the Liberal government is in the business of legislating every facet of society including control true Canadian culture well I mean I think it's an instinct in every politician to control what they can it's a human nature to exert our authority in the world around us but the point is you know ordinary citizens are restrained by their own rights and powers and wealth and persuasiveness the problem is when government gets involved they have the power of the state to back it up and that's what worries me and the thing is conservatives inherently have a distrust for big government's and they try and limit it whereas liberals tend to want to expand the scope of government it's an authoritarian Enterprise by Nature Megan Rogers says can't watch it this time Ezra I'm at work all right fair enough Fred Flinstone says I'm too poor for Ezra to listen to what I have to say Ezra's only Kara's money for his pocket no I don't think so in fact I think I just read what you have to say my point about the super chat is that as you can see there are hundreds of comments there I don't even have the time to read them let alone to respond to them in any meaningful way the super chat is your way of saying I really care about this question please answer it and it's a way for us to help pay the bills unlike the CBC we don't get 1.5 billion dollars the government unlike the corporate media we don't have large attackers you're welcome to watch all you like Alexander V was kind enough to chip in $2 thank you very much I don't see any question linked to it oh I see a few comments about what's going on in Ontario politics Phoenix says tanyon should start a real Conservative Party and Canadian redneck says they will go after Andrew Luck next that's a reference to the decision by Doug Ford to throw tania Granick allen under the bus she was the socially conservative candidate who had a very strong showing in the Ontario PC leadership through her support behind Doug Ford and that clearly made the difference made him beat Christine Elliot the odds-on favorite to win and over the weekend some old quotes that she said using the phrase ninja to describe a niqab I think I did that in my comments here today too and being critical of radical sex ed in kindergartens any parent would be that got her to be thrown out as a candidate and I think that that's bad formed by Doug Ford and I'll go into the extended reasons why on my 8 p.m. show tonight if you're not a subscriber you can do that easily enough I want to take a short break it's 12:30 1:00 p.m. and let's run an ad for an event we have coming up in June party don't want us to discuss political correctness be damned not principally Titan world by perhaps we are in better touch with the country we are in this fight with you and you're all in this fight together it's the over the last few years has been this populist movement going around the world that's the status of the left at this point is I don't know if you're the onion or the New York Times most modern hasn't been sophisticated the philosophy they'll draw but it's deeply wrong we're simply people with another point of view there you have eventless some clips from last year's rebel live we're doing again this year in less than a month June 2nd at Canada Christian College is a great venue it's large it's affordable it's easy to get to and my favorite part about it is they believe in freedom of speech so it's one of the few venues in Toronto where the anti fought and the violent alt left can't get you D platform we used to do an event at the Monte Cassino Hotel and Conference Center on Chestnut Drive very nice place I have my book launch there we get along very well with them we've had successful events there and then we had a rally scheduled there and some thugs threatened them and the hotel ripped up our contract on like 36 hours notice before the event so Canada Christian College has been our home ever since even even though that our content is not Christian in character so we had some great speakers last year you can see Doug Ford himself there Jordan Peterson and this year we've got a great lineup but Katie Hopkins is coming from the UK John Cardillo is coming in from the states and my crazy friend Gavin McInnes is coming just because I think he's going to irritate all the right people and I want to be a sneak preview we haven't officially announced it yet but Lindsey Sheppard it's gonna be coming this year I just gave you a scoop Lindsey Sheppard who became famous of Laurier University she was the graduate student and teaching assistant who dared to show a video clip which of the Petersons in her class and she was interrogated by politically correct professors when she turned the tables on them should be one of our keynote speakers I make two more announcements later today um let's just take you have more comments and then I have one more story for you about Google and their so-called fact-checking trust no one says Ezra what I have to do to be part of the show well if you're talking about the rebel live anyone's welcome to attend go to the rebel live calm in fact I think we still have our early bird pricing which is so cheap it's crazy for your student or senior I think our early bird pricing if it's still on is 35 bucks for a whole day that includes parking breakfast and lunch I mean you can't get parking breakfast and lunch in Toronto for 35 bucks even without a full day of stuff I did such a low price it's crazy that's going up a little bit once hourly buddies burns over why did you guys drop faith Goldie well I mean I don't want to rehash that but we dropped faith Cole because she went on a neo-nazi podcast called the daily stormer and she kept that hidden from us and I don't mean to relitigate that I wish faith well of what she's doing but she just went too far you just can't you just can't do that and you know faith is a friend I haven't talked to her recently but I wish I will someone called accountable politicians Candace said what would you do to make Equalization more fair well I think what I would do is I would send equalization payments from Alberta and Saskatchewan to Quebec via pipeline that would ensure the pipelines got built right I mean one of my arguments against any Coderre and his opposition to the Energy's pipeline was you can't take the fruits of the oil industry in terms of equalization payments yet oppose the oil industry when it needs pipelines send the payments by pipeline that thing will get built lickety-split I'm gonna read another prophet one one one says Ezra how do you feel about Canada sending a hundred and fifty million to Rohingya Muslims well it's more virtue signaling from Justin Trudeau I haven't seen that news story I take your word for it because that does sound like a Trudeau thing to do virtue signaling for sending cash we'll never see any accountability for the cash just throw it on the big pile of deficits and debt the Trudeau's racked up already just jack up the taxes some more jack up the carbon tax but I would say that it is that it could be worse it could be what would be worse is bringing roe hinga migrants to Canada they don't speak English or French they have no job skills they have no cultural fit whatsoever and it would just be a disaster in every way other than they would vote liberals so if I had to choose between giving 150 million dollars of hard-earned tax money to foreigners just because it's the flavor of the month I would rather do that than have 150,000 Rohingya brought here and don't think that's not a real possibility one more comment before I go to our next story Muslims elevate Sharia law above our Constitution well that is the nature of Sharia law the world is divided into two parts dar al-harb and dar al-islam there's the the the part of the the kingdom of Sharia the submission to Allah and then there's the kingdom of war and the whole concept of the Muslim Ummah which means nation is that it is superior to any nationalism that's why Muslim extremists don't believe in any particular secular government that's why the Islamic state is called the Islamic state that's why they rip up passports they don't believe in elections they mock our democracy because they believe that is subordinate and inferior to an Islamic theocracy called the caliphate now those are weird words caliphate theocracy but they certainly had a comeback under isis for a few years and they remain in the hearts and minds of many muslim extremists so what you say is actually true I'm gonna take a break from the comments because there's one more story I want to read to you and it's so 38 subconscious at the time all right you know these days there's a lot of fact-checking and corrections on social media Twitter Facebook YouTube Google Microsoft these are companies that are injecting themselves into the communications on their medium so they give me the example when you would make a phone call in the past the phone company wouldn't listen in on your phone call if you and someone else we're having a conversation that was politically incorrect no one would know and if you made it no and the phone company wouldn't interfere they were merely giving you a service a platform so to speak like a theater that would rent out a stage to anyone as opposed to a theatrical production company that would put on their own show do you see the difference and so today's social media companies are they're not like the old phone companies that would simply let you say whatever you want to say on their platform without comment they want to meddle interfere edit push back which is I think very dangerous it's unprecedented I mean the post office did not open your mail and read it before they approved your ability to send it there they just said is there a stamp on it the rest we don't care about I'm not talking about extreme cases where you sense I don't know an explosive package in the mail or something like that or even a violent threat in the mail understand that both of those are crimes unrelated to the medium sending explosives as a crime in its own right sending a death threat is a crime in its own right neither are rooted in the medium itself and what's happening now in all these social media is that they're interfering meddling with your use and their interjecting they're saying oh I see that you've posted something that our busybodies on the left has objected to here's a corrective and literally push it would be like it would be like you're on the phone with someone having an unapproved conversation and the operator breaks it excuse me I overheard you saying this I'd like to bring to your attention the other point of view that's so absurd but that's exactly what's going on let me show you what Google has done could you put this on the screen so this is a tweet by Lahav heart cough let me just read the whole thing just just stay with me I'm gonna go through this hi Google you're showing me a fact check the claims the Palestinian Authority doesn't pay terrorists in fact the PA admits to paying them see this new york times correction what is it called when a fact check needs fact-checking and i don't know if we can click on that there we go so if you do see up top there this fella google searched PA pays terrorist PA stands for palestinian authority so you can see there's a Washington Post story and just stay with me here does the Palestinian Authority pay 350 million dollars a year to terrorists and and just look it says claim that's what they do and claimed by Benjamin Netanyahu fact check by the Washington Post's two Pinocchio's so what you see here is Google is putting their finger on the scale they're saying ah there's some Jew lover some Zionists are somewhat Islamophobe or someone hostile to the dictatorship of the Palestinian Authority who wants the facts about the Palestinian Authority paying terrorists we're gonna jump right in Wikipedia's first Jerusalem post a second and the third entry is what they call a fact check and look at the breakdown there but then look at the next one look at the next one put the next image up if we have it this is the correction that appeared in The New York Times an article on Sunday about Campbell Browns role as Facebook's head of news partnerships erroneously included a reference to Palestinian actions as an example of the sort of far-right conspiracy stories that have plagued Facebook in fact Palestinian officials have acknowledged providing payments to the families of Palestinians killed while carrying out attacks on Israelis or convicted of terrorist attacks and imprisoned in Israel that is not a conspiracy theory oh really oh really so so how many social justice warriors working in Silicon Valley got this wrong Google did Facebook did I think the Washington Post it I didn't quite understand and to this day if you go on the Google search engine it will tell you that truth is a lie and it will call that a fact check and on your Facebook and Twitter feeds is more of that than ever and it just goes to show that one man's spin or fake news is another man's truth and isn't the whole point of free speech the clash of ideas and we expose the weaknesses in each other's ideas and we learn about the weaknesses in our own ideas and we find our way to the truth together in this cacophonous marketplace of ideas but instead of just being a neutral market where anyone can hock their wares Facebook YouTube Google Microsoft Amazon whoever they're now saying no no we're gonna be the arbiter for you sorry I don't want Mark Zuckerberg as my arbiter I don't trust a word he says why should I trust him above my own judgment ah let's go back to the comments now it's 1243 we got 17 minutes I'm going to remind you what what you're doing what we're doing here is every day at 8 p.m. Eastern Time I have a show called the Ezra Levin shows behind a paywall I have a scripted monologue today I go on a great length about Tania Granick Ellen and about Jason Kenny's decision in Alberta to ignore 57% of the grass roots delegates of the United Conservative Party and I see this as a troubling trend of giving my thoughts on that at a p.m. and every day we to do two interviews - so that's my formal show but we thought well heck why not everyday hop on for an hour something less produced just a few live video clips and tweets and whatnot and take some feedback so that's what we do because there's hundreds of people who have comments I do try and read them but if you want yours to stand out you could chip in two bucks five bucks ten bucks last week a few people chipped in 50 bucks if you can believe it that ensures I see your comment because it puts in colorful highlight and it also gives us free bucks and we need the money because we're not subsidized by government let me get back back to comments but before I do let me run one more quick ad about what else we do here the rebel women don't even know about motion - Sardonicus overhead budget phenomenal planning galilee moon mission hey there you go did you know we're starting to make documentaries now that's our first one called save the Christians calm I don't have all the details of the DVDs and streaming but so we have had two premieres of the film one in Toronto one in Calgary hundreds of people attend each one and the feedback was very positive so if you're curious go to save the Christians calm and we should have information shortly about how you can get your hands on that films it's 1246 I got 14 minutes left let me go to some comments I'm gonna just I'm just gonna pick them at random here Robert Williams says or what do you think about Doug Ford well I answer that a little bit I think it was inappropriate of him to throw a tanning cranek Allen under the bus for comments that while they may not have been so perfectly polished I don't think that they are defective enough to destroy a candidacy over especially given that first of all she was the kingmaker she made him the leader second of all she won her nomination with an enormous turnout of grassroots support I think the worst part of it is the Doug Ford has shown he can be easily duped or pushed into doing things through a sort of reverse psychology by the Liberals if they hound him loudly enough if they scare him with the media magnifying their attacks that Ford will jump and he is more worried about what the CBC in the Toronto Star says about him than what a significant part of this day says and let me ask you this from a campaign point of view is there a single person today who will now vote for Doug Ford who would not have voted for him a week ago I don't think so I think the haters who hate Tandy Granick Allen hate Doug Ford just as much they were just trying to create a fuss and even by indulging it I think Doug Ford is legitimized it if he would just mock the media laugh at them in a manner that Donald Trump does I think he would this would have just been more squawking by the Liberals in fact he rationalized it and confirmed it by submitting to it well by the way you don't think that's just what their appetite for more let's read some more hmm oh there's a super chat I missed it let me go and find it there Jonathan Bryant who dropped the ball with Digby mine well that's a great question that was a show I did last week about a mine in Nova Scotia it was a quarry for basalt is kind of don't even know if I'm pronouncing that right it's a kind of volcanic rock and a company wanted to have a quarry there and build a little marine terminal and export this rock from Digby Neck Nova Scotia to the States for 50 years and they thought they could make half a billion dollars over it the province and the feds got together with what's called a joint review panel so it was a doubling up of the environmental hearings on once so what was supposed to be more streamlined turned into a meltdown of social justice clap traffic and to answer your question it was the combination of the federal bureaucrats and the provincial bureaucrats who made the decision and that decision was accepted by the government and so I think there's enough blame to go around I think it's our system that's broken I think our regulations and a regulatory approvals process that was over ten years ago and by the way just to update people they don't know what I'm talking about the rock quarry company sued the Canadian and Nova Scotia governments under the NAFTA suit cans are really under NAFTA because they were treated improperly a NAFTA panel found for the plaintiffs and that was confirmed last week by the federal court so Canada is on the hook for half a billion dollars now for this rock quarry they never got built because it was treated so unfairly the concept of social licence was brought to life as in there weren't real rules that this quarry company failed they weren't dangerous they weren't environmentally dangerous they didn't fail to meet any standard it was just as loosey goosey oh you're against our vision you're against our feelings and the NAFTA panel said sorry that is not fair you say here are the rules have a company meet the real rules but then mix their investment after they spent millions by cooking up some fake social justice rules so that was an incredible ruling who do we blame well I think we blame there's a lot of blame to go around I think the burek some bureaucrats on the joint review panel I think that provincial and federal politicians who didn't push back against the joint review panel and I think things are much worse now 10 years later so I'm actually a lot worried that if you look at some of the things that Catherine McKenna is talking about using to approve industrial projects gender analysis Aboriginal traditional cultural analysis these are so loosey goosey that any industrial investor whose application is Scotch because of this I think they'll have a massive claim someone with a nickname write news says check out the write news app on Google Play all right I might do that thank you and thanks for the two bucks appreciate that and thanks for joining us today grant Burrell says global citizenship in grade schools in Alberta and Ezra is not saying a word you should watch my show tonight you should watch my show tonight at 8:00 p.m. I talk a lot about the crazy and doctrine indoctrination in schools I am based in Ontario now but I know for a fact that schools in every single province have so much junk masquerading as education but it's all politics why can't we just get back to reading writing arithmetic and have you want current events fine have current events have a debating Club but this ideology that is being pushed is so odious and and it's no wonder to me that 57% of Delegates in Alberta at the United Conservative Party convention voted for parental notification of this kind of extremism despite the fact that Jason Kenney and other emulates did not want them to do that parents are fed up and I note that my friend Jason Kenney is not a parent so he doesn't know how grindingly frustrating and scary and disappointing and impotent it feels when teachers say haha you can't do anything we're going to teach radical activism to your students and you won't even know about it there's a feeling and a parent of just pit in your stomach when you hear that and I don't think you really know how Babette is until you're a parent and you feel that teachers are against you and they're actually trying to come between you and your own child with their ideology and it's not it's not scholarship it's not academia ideology Suzuki is fully infiltrated in our school systems it's really gross let me read some more questions it is a 1253 I'll take your questions for the next seven minutes justin trudeau cringe channel sodomy has no place in the schools listen homosexuality is a fact of life and I think there is a place for it in sex ed actually but what gets me is how the sex ed is being pulled so sews and by the way it should be taught with care and I think there should be parental involvement and I think parents should be notified about that I mean the issue of homosexuality is a real issue and I think it is part of sexuality how that's taught I think parents need to be involved and parents need to have the right to take their kids out of school if they disagree my chief quarrel with these sex ed curriculum and I use the phrase child sex curriculum because you're telling kindergarten kids this stuff I don't want kindergartens kids to learn about heterosexual sex or homosexual sex I don't want five-year-olds to learn about sex there ought to be some age of innocence you don't need to start teaching six-year-olds five year olds about sexuality let there be a period of time when they can be children and I think that most of the quarrels these days with this extremist sexual education is just how young it's forced and I think that's done to sensitize and conditioned children to have extremely grown-up conversations when they are not ready for that and I do not think it is a coincidence that the deputy minister in charge of Ontario's child sex curriculum was convicted of child pornography and of trying to arrange to meet young children online for the express purpose of molesting them the fact that the child sex curriculum that he developed is was actually put into use despite his conviction would give any parent pause and this isn't being anti-gay or anti even anti-transgender it's just for God's sakes these are five and six year olds and yeah if my five and six year old is being taught things that we haven't even discussed it or contemplated discussing because he's just five or six yeah I think parents have the right to him to get engaged Victoria pizanno has a super chat have you heard of Project Veritas story of Teachers Union corruption in the States protecting teachers who have sexual relations with underaged students and protecting them and so on yes I have that is a great story we should have James O'Keefe back on the show he's been on my show half dozen times he's done these great interviews with teachers union bosses before but this one you're exactly right and I understand the New Jersey Police are investigating what looks like a cover-up of teachers having sex with students and then in the name of union solidarity keeping that hidden from not just police but from parents so you can understand why parents are worried when sexuality is being taught of that at such tender years absolutely I'm looking at some work on lists I don't want to get deep into sex and I'm not against sex ad being taught I just think parents ought to be able to have a say in those things and ought to know if those things are coming down the pike and I do not believe that they should be taught in grades yeah I got a question for you no googling no googling the answer you know these days it's tough to ask someone a tricky question because they just hop on their phone and they google it and get the answer right away if I were to say what's the capital of Kazakhstan you know everyone could be smart in 30 seconds by googling it but would you know it before you googled here's my question don't google the answer what are the six genders now I know there's many more on Facebook but in the Ontario school sex ed curriculum that is enforced developed by Ben Levin the convicted pedophile imposed by Kathleen Wynne what are this exchanges by the way being gay is not a saina gender can you list the six I bet you can't I can't and I've read them five times she's so made up goofy stuff and my point is that is being tied Shirley Shirley apparent whether it's out of concern for your religious faith your customs or traditions are just keeping your kid's head out of that kooky extreme theoretic Ixia reticle experiment yeah yeah you know what teaching grade one kids are I forget which which you're in grade school that's taught that ain't scholarship that in academia that is a human experiment on children and it's not anti-gay or anti sex to say you know what keep my child out of your schemes and that's all Tanya cranek allen was all about and that's all the 57% of the people united conservative party without burner on about and and i have to say that that case the victoria points out about the teachers unions in New Jersey it is not unrelated all right let's go to the let's go to the comments we have two minutes left there aren't six that are only two male and female there is only two genders male and female listen my point is according to the government of Ontario that is six and what are you gonna do about it what are you gonna do about parents say I want to know about it and Kathleen Wynne says oh you're a sexist of you ally Clarke with a very generous fifty dollar donation thank you so much Elliott so very generous of you says only to male and female well that's the thing I mean as soon as we got away from saying the word sex to gender then it got blurry what's the I mean sex is the it's x and y chromosomes you can't really fake it and transgenderism I mean if you're into the if you're googling the six genders google this it was only a few years ago that the American Psychiatric Association had a vote a vote at a convention to say that transgenderism was no longer a psychiatric illness and it's gone from being a listed illness according to the American Psychiatric Association who really a commandment in what five years normalized everywhere from TV to movies to political correctness it's it's actually the hottest thing right now even more so than Islamophobia if you even say the word tranny which was sort of an affectionate nickname I think a decade ago you get fired ask our friend Gavin McInnes so yeah it's an extremism and I think of a certain point in time you just have to say look we're not being anti-gay or anti transgenderism when we're saying don't talk to my six-year-old about that just don't cuz six-year-olds aren't meant to talk about sex of any style of variety and stop putting those things in their head and all Alberta's 57% said is hey can you let me know when that's about to happen because I don't want to be a part of that you know what you're gonna see homeschooling take off if this stuff is rammed through if this stuff is rammed through you're gonna see if they go we'll look at that it's 1 p.m. and we're out of time and that's it for today's battleground it's a chitchat we do every day it's pretty easy peasy not overly produced every day 1 p.m. at 12 to 1 I want to check out the time because because I'm hearing from people saw the communion time and if there's a way we can do it to get more viewers I want it but in the meantime we're going to stay with this timeslot so we figure things out I appreciate you joining us thanks to everyone who chipped in a few bucks in the super chat and Ally you were very generous with your $50.00 I appreciate that it's sort of like a telethon isn't it it's sort of like a fundraising telephone and that's what it

bye-bye you
