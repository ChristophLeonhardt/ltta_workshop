hey good afternoon it is Tuesday July 17th and I'm David Menzies filling in for Ezra Levant and this is battle ground well ladies and gentlemen thank you for tuning in and thank you for putting up with me yet again Ezra as you may or may not know is in the UK and the good news is is that he was given entry into the UK unlike some other right-of-center people in recent months and years and the even better news is he hasn't been totally the UK yet and of course he's there to cover the Tommy Robinson hearing that is scheduled for tomorrow and we will bring you up to date with everything that goes on there very important what's happening there of course and this is a huge huge issue for most of you I know now being the middle of July before we get to the burning news of the day got to say it is the baseball all-star game tonight and I've done an informal poll amongst all my friends families and colleagues here at the red ball asking who's watching it and you know what rhymes with hero the number is zero and I think this basically supports my position that is it not time to get rid of all-star games in all the sports I mean arguably baseball's is the most meaningful but I think these are I don't know throwback to the past that are no longer relevant anymore folks I mean once upon a time you never saw the American League and the National League players compete against each other unless it was a World Series of course now there's interleague games and once upon a time there was very little sports on TV there'd be a weekly or bi-weekly game now we have 24-hour sports channels and we see things happening on the west coast whereas you'd only read about them two days later in the so that was kind of the idea for an all-star game let's have one night we're in primetime on the East Coast everybody gets to see the Stars and now I think given the advent of 24-hour sports television and how the leagues have changed there is no real reason for an all-star game not only baseball but hockey what is that it's just glorified shinny I mean it's a disgrace to call that product a hockey game even when they put a million bucks on the line for the winning team and as for football the Pro Bowl well as the saying goes if you bet on the Pro Bowl you have a gambling addiction problem okay I mean not even the players competing in the Pro Bowl want to be at the Pro Bowl so enough about speaking of sports because we really don't do that here unless there's a political element to it and speaking of politics plenty of that coming out of Helsinki yesterday Trump had his meeting with Putin and before we get into the meat and potatoes of that I think we have a clip and if we can run that right here that would be fantastic people came to me dan coates came to me and some others they said they think it's Russia I have president putin he just said it's not Russia I will say this I don't see any reason why it would be but I really do want to see the server of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DMC where are those servers they're missing where are they what happened to Hillary Clinton's emails 33,000 emails gone just gone I think in Russia they wouldn't begun so easily I think it's a disgrace that we can't get Hillary Clinton's 33,000 emails so I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today and what he did is an incredible offer he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people I think that's an incredible offer well you know folks I'm not one of the multitude of Trump critics out there far from it I do like the president I think he's going to he has all the hallmarks of being a great president and matter of fact yesterday was not his greatest moment however I don't know it really rang hollow when he said well you know why I spoke to Putin and Putin strongly denied any involvement it's kind of like you know the detective on a murder case going to assess back and saying you know we asked him if he had anything to do with the murder and he said no so hey what are you gonna do you got to believe him now I'm not saying that I believe in the Russian collusion Theory far from it I do believe that ever since the inception of the Soviet Union they have done everything in their power to interfere with most elections in important Western democracies however what I would have liked to have seen the president do yesterday was to take a more firm stance with Putin and on that point when it comes to the larger picture of Russian interference I would have loved for the president to say to him stare him down and say we know what you're doing we're not gonna stand for it anymore you know we're watching you because this is unacceptable I think if he had done that I think he would have answered the critics on both sides that statement about well we asked him he denied it so who you're gonna believe I don't think that cuts it and maybe there's a way for him to get out of this rigmarole you know I have to say too for those who remember the Stephen Harper era it was Stephen Harper that really took a tough stance on Russia it was Stephen Harper who led the charge in terms of criticism about the Soviet Union when it came to Russia sorry not uh the charge against Russia against their involvement in Ukraine and it was also Harper that led the charge against Russia for what they were doing in Crimea and actually led the charge to get Russia kicked out of the g7 which was eventually what happened that was tough talk and principled talk and I would have liked have seen that kind of a stance taken by the president yesterday and we didn't get it and I think even Trump supporters are not all that happy with that performance yesterday let's see what you have to say in terms of if we're getting any comments on that Mark Jones says Donald is a Putin ax stand believes folks I am going to try to get better with this but it the chat keeps going a little faster than and my computer is frozen again copepod sao says was a guilty until proven innocent or was it innocent until proven guilty well depends if you're a democrat or republican i guess and then we have grant our was something said about trump in scotland I know it was golfing in Scotland but if you can elaborate on that I'll get into it and we have from pke racing Shearer was a SOI boy too bad Michelle Rempel isn't leader I would like to see Michelle replace leader as well Debbie Ursa says you are buying it you are buying into the BS Menzies well I'm not I mean listen I I call them as I see em I we were talking about the baseball all-star game I think people in this position have to be like the umpire behind home plate you got to call them like you see them it can't just do PR for those who support no matter what they say no matter what their actions are and I just think yesterday was a stumble I'm sorry and if you can make your case I'll read it please send it in El Dorado we are all we know about Putin is pure propaganda by the deep state well it is a propaganda state to be sure marked Hagopian says as a trump supporter the only collusion was with Hillary if they had something out would already be front-page news I agree with that too by the way I think there's a lot more shall we say despicable actions on the behalf of the Democrats then the Republicans when it comes to any kind of collusion but I think we have seen certain arms of law enforcement and intelligent gathering in the United States being politically influenced and that is why the Democrats are getting to skate on so many of these allegations and Dillman dontoh rights what's your opinion on the Libertarian Party deliberate which libertarian party if you can clear that up I think the libertarian party stands for many of the things I stand for certainly the Ontario libertarian party I saw the interview I saw the leader being interviewed in the last provincial election and many of the things he was saying you know such as get government out of elements of our life that they shouldn't be in you know like running casinos like running liquor stores and on it goes yeah those are libertarian principles I totally buy into and Debbie Ursa writes back he cannot publicly embarrass Putin that would be disastrous well I don't know why and didn't he already publicly embarrassed Putin I mean when the US sent in those missile strikes to Syria this was against the wishes of Russia and Putin so I think that's even more than publicly embarrassing that and I think you know folks as I said yesterday Russia's a bit of a strange fish here when it comes to the West it is neither an enemy nor is it an ally and there is some kind of middle ground that we have to take with them and I just think that much like Stephen Harper when it comes to calling out Russia for doing bad things that's what you have to do and I think maybe the president could have been more forceful on that yesterday let's see what else we have here eldorado says if he did they would say trump starting World War three well I think he's already been a kissed of attempting to start World War 3 with Iran and North Korea so these kind of ridiculous statements can apply to any part I think maybe if Donald Trump took a harsh stance against Grenada they would accuse that as the stepping stone towards the path of World War three and what else we have here Mark Jones the football was bugged Secret Service let that they're confirmed well you know maybe that's why I think the football that Marc's referring to folks is the the gift Putin gave Trump we call it a soccer ball over here it wasn't the oblong pigskin variety and Trump said he was gonna give it to his son who is a big soccer fan and then he threw it into the crowd into milania's waiting hands so maybe if Trump thought there was a bug in there he did a very important and prudent thing by getting rid of that hot potato too sweet and we have from El Chapo Herrera a Harper is no different than Trudeau and Shearer they all want globalism no I don't I don't buy that I don't agree with that that's a kind of conspiracy theory stuff and the deep state no anyways so keep your comments coming about your take on this meeting I'm happy to read them when we get them and perhaps moving on speaking of the president you know this is incredible what's happening in the US right now you've seen Republicans in public places such as restaurants being screamed at being yelled at so much that they have to leave the facility just because there are a bunch of lunatics there that don't agree with their politics but folks have you been keeping track about what's happening with the ride-sharing service uber there's been a couple of cases down south where the uber driver has simply discontinued the ride because he didn't like the brand of politics that had entered his car now one of the stories is about some individuals who began talking politics and obviously I take it from who they are they were pro-trump Pro Republican and the uber driver this was a 20 mile long ride the uber driver pulled over to a gas station just a random gas station and basically did the arnold schwarzenegger line from terminator to get out basically saying that people with your politics can't have a ride in this vehicle and last week there were three young interns all of whom were blacked in Washington DC and they were carrying make America great again caps they weren't even wearing them and once the driver saw what those caps were he told them get out he denied them service I mean it's I don't know it's almost like the 2018 version of Rosa Parks going on here but have we entered a realm where having a particular a political opinion or wearing a particular fashion statement that has your politics on it that means you are now denied service and I have to say uber has really dropped the ball from a public relations standpoint in both cases I believe they've issued a statement that we're looking into it well why does it take so long to look into this I mean this is I think an egregious breach of Terms of Service and it shouldn't be tolerated and I wonder also what the media coverage would be if it was reversed if these were uber drivers who were right-of-center and for whatever reason discovered that there were left of center people in their vehicles and they decided to either not offer the ride or just pull over to some random gas station and tell them to get out it is outrageous and what whatever happened to the idea of agreeing to disagree and by the way if you are an uber driver right I know who / drivers get engaged in conversation and that's fantastic but if you can't you know find it within yourself to have a debate and to have a discussion and thrash the issues through without saying get out of my vehicle then why don't you just shut up and do what you're being paid for which is to bring somebody from point A to point B I mean I don't think there's anything I might be wrong in the uber Terms of Service that indicate that those with a right-of-center political viewpoint shall be denied a ride if the driver deems that is necessary so there you go and let's see what some of you have to say rattlesnakes a rattlesnake rather says course uber drivers in the US would do that this would be illegal you know I think it might be it's certainly what we have to have here I think is a test case and see if this passes the the sniff test for legality and we have a super chat from Betty Bennett free Tommy Tommy absolutely and you know what I wonder if you were I have a free Tommy cap at home a wonderful at the last rebel live event gave it to me and I wonder if I was wearing that in an uber car or in a cab in the UK I wonder if that would get me kicked out of a cab there - maybe it's worth doing a test on but thank you very much for your generous gift of five pounds sterling and see that's Amanda joy says no ride for you yeah I think Amanda's referring to the infamous Soup Nazi of Seinfeld Fame that's the fellow who ran that incredible soup kitchen and unless you had your mannerisms down to a tee ie you had to line up a certain way you had to have your money ready you couldn't make any kind of small talk you couldn't make any substitutions and if you veered from that as Elaine Benes found out the answer was no soup for you so yeah we are in the soup Nazi regime of ubering it would seem and USA mum mommy mama mummy writes un-freakin'-believable I agree it is unbelievable and eldorado makes a good point good they lose half of their business you know that is actually a very good point because our things so good for uber drivers now that you can be picky about who you want to give a ride to I mean there are other competing services now such as lift lifted I came into the Toronto market late last year and I know for a fact that there are far more Oberer drivers today than there were just two or three years ago in all the markets they serve so I wonder is ubering so lucrative that you know a driver can go mmm I don't like the cap that guys wearing I don't like her t-shirt I don't like this guy's political viewpoints because in the end it's self-defeating yeah I mean at the end of the day it's to get fares and May money I mean that is why you're driving strangers around town isn't it or maybe if there's some uber drivers out there that can educate me on the reality of ubering I'll bring that to the for a to and Tammy writes some taxi drivers of a religious persuasion are also denying service to people with Guide Dogs you know you're absolutely right Tammy this is an issue that comes up from time to time and it's typically blind people with seeing-eye dogs and you are not allowed I mean the law is very clear on this you cannot deny a blind person service and as I understand it from stories that have been published on this in the past typically the people who are denying the service are Muslim cab drivers believing this is Haram to have a dog in the car even a trained service dog and the way I understand it is that they're out is that I can't do this not for religious reasons but because I have an allergy to dogs well I'm not a U of T mathematician folks but I can tell you this if it's found that 99.99% of Muslim cab drivers have an allergy to canines I would say that is statistically impossible not improbable impossible but that is the card that is always being played when this comes to task and it is despicable and it shouldn't be tolerated and it shouldn't and and and also for uber drivers as well it should not be tolerated too and religion I don't believe is an a valid excuse to deny someone I mean can you imagine that can you imagine going through life blind and you're dependent on your dog to get you around I mean it's it's a fate I wouldn't wish on anyone and then you have to add you know add into the mix that no because of the way I interpret my religion you're not getting in and by the way interesting thing I once heard an interview with it was a Muslim group that represented blind Muslims who are out making an outreach to taxi cab drivers to say that you there is nothing really wrong there's nothing against the Quran and having a dog you that is assisting a handicapped person into your taxi cab because when you think of it some of the blind people out there are of the Muslim faith and they're getting burned by this kind of belligerent stance too I would argue so good good point Tammy and let's see okay Sam Hale writes always be aware that uber is a private vehicle it's not yours because you paid to the third-party app this is what freedom is stop pretending it's not freedom well you know that's the interesting thing about this yeah you're right it is an uber driver would be I guess by nature an agent a freelancer not an employee of the ubirr corporation but by the same token I will I bet you that uber drivers have to sign an agreement in terms of Terms of Service about who they can and cannot take in that cab I mean for example I just wonder what the media outrage would be if somebody came into an uber car and was wearing it the niqab or the burqa would this be just dismissed oh well it's freedom of choice you know no I did that unlike the maggots and the political discussions that would be front-page news and it would be Islamophobia and you can bet you you could bet your life uber would get on this case very quickly indeed unlike what they're doing right now rag in the puck with the right-of-center people being kicked out see from real men fish by bacon Hale and uber cab well it depends on who's driving it me I love the Santa bacon I love the taste of bacon no problem here and Tammy writes back uber drivers are indeed subcontracted to provide a service and that's what I was getting at folks that I think you have to agree to the Terms of Service in order to be an uber driver and but isn't it just petty let's forget about any agreements that have been signed personally you know being in this business I'm always getting into debates and arguments with other people and I've never taken the point of view that because you disagree with me this discussion must end or because you disagree with me get out of the car I've never taken that position I I think it's a cowardly position I mean if you can't state your case with your words as opposed to shutting down the debate I would argue you really don't have much of a case at all and see okay and Michael LaFave writes good afternoon if Tommy does get or I don't know if you mean does not get released or does get released do you think the British government will have to explain themselves or will they just shut us off like they always do they're probably under no obligation to explain themselves and right now I'd really like to know what they are thinking I think that they've bitten off more than they could chew they thought they were shutting down you know they were literally you know putting an end to the messenger of a message they didn't want out there and quickly realized they had a potential martyr on their hands especially if god forbid anything were to happen to Tommy in jail but there have been protests and demonstrations I don't think they counted on that and I think the vast majority British people if you were to speak to them honestly they are tombi supporters and they don't like what's happening to their country and they don't like how right now in the UK it is proverbially the tail wagging the dog so this is going to be a fascinating case Ezra's gonna cover and you're gonna hear it first right here from Ezra from that British courtroom and see what else do we have yeah okay wake up rights cabs only for me well you know what and that's your choice if you can still find a cab these days I guess I know they've been really hit hard by the ride-sharing services but who's to say that this kind of an attitude wouldn't be espoused by a cab driver as well as Tammy pointed out we already have incidents where cab drivers refuse service to blind people with seeing-eye dogs so I don't know if a cab is a viable alternative and see okay and Tammy again you're right David it is pretty its petty to throw people out of your vehicle for a hat etc and eldorado says if uber has a bad driver the driver will soon be out of work when they have zero stars that's right uber drivers and their customers are rated on a star's service I don't I don't know you know how what the benchmark is it five stars is perfect zero is zero and I don't know what the number is for her to say to a driver listen we're just every just about every writer was complaining about you for whatever reason so you're off the platform but I guess that is one way of a check in a balance for the ride-sharing service and what else do we have here okay I think we've pretty much covered off the the uber issue so why don't we move along to oh yes Gerald bye you know and immigration you know we have a horrible mess right now in Canada thanks to this government's reaction to oh I don't know what you want to call them because I don't even know what they are are they refugees are they asylum seekers are they are the migrants are they people that are jumping the queue are they economic migrants I know one thing for sure there was a story in it about this in the Sun today by Mark bonnet Kowski outrageously bungled I agree with that headline you probably can't see it it's an asylum seeker coming face to face with a an RCMP officer and yeah it's at an illegal border crossing and I guess he's making his case therefore the RCMP officer to carry his luggage but speaking of luggage I notice he's got what appears to be a really posh high-end jacket on and also an adidas logo backpack I don't think that's cheap I don't think that's the kind of stuff you get at Dollarama and everything looks new and he doesn't look hungry and looks like it doesn't look disheveled and again it is someone who is male typically in their 20s or 30s that are coming across the border and the more I see of this the more I chalk it up to economic opportunism if you don't have to get in line and queue up and make your case to be a Canadian citizen and all you have to do is walk across some farmer's field or some vacant lot somewhere along the longest unprotected border in the world well why not why wouldn't you do it especially if you're leaving a country where there is you know such little economic opportunity for you but that's not how our system works it's not how it should and what I really find outrageous by the Trudeau liberals especially Gerald Butz who is of course Justin's puppet master listen to this tweet folks quote enough is enough it's time to stand up to this divisive fear-mongering about asylum seekers let's not allow the alt-right to do here what they're doing elsewhere end quote okay two things Gerald where is elsewhere he never says where this elsewhere is so where is it what what are you referring to and also this nonsense about the alt-right you know that this is some kind of sinister boogeyman laying under our bed this is the the real threat to Canada and our values can you stop it already Gerald no one's buying what you're selling we just believe in sovereign borders if a nation doesn't have borders it ceases to be a nation I mean you know I talked about this a couple of weeks ago in the New York Times there was I still have it the paper edition it was an opinion piece by an Italian contributing writer and just look at this oh we have some footage here you saw some of the Royal Canadian baggage police in action there but well folks look at this headline this is in the New York Times are Italians turning racist not yet and I show you the paper version because if you go online guess what that headline has been tweaked it's no longer that it's something a little less controversial but the whole idea of this piece is that Italians are becoming more racist because they want their government to enforce tighter border controls I mean there are already six hundred and eleven thousand illegals in Italy most of them again like I said earlier you men and it makes me wonder by the way if these are indeed refugees where the woman where the children where the elderly you need a detective to find them practically and the solution here by this writer is that what the government should be doing instead of enforcing its border security and instead of deporting illegals and by the way most of the deported people don't leave any ways is to issue temporary job permits as if there are six hundred and eleven thousand jobs begging right now in Italy it's preposterous and it is absolutely egregious that this author would label Italians as racist or at least turning racist because they want strong borders around their country like I said a country without borders it's not a country at all and let's go and see what we have to do with what this and and by the way it's not just Gerald Butz our immigration minister Ahmad has said he had words for Lisa McLeod and Doug Ford and I think we have a clip of that don't we guys because seeing is believing asylum seekers are processed in a separate queue of the IRB and all the other immigrant regular immigration programs are processed by IRC CE and conflating the two knowingly is irresponsible it's divisive it's fear-mongering and it is not Canadian you see there again the it's not Canadian card and the fear mongering and the divisiveness I would say isn't this what the federal government is doing having it seems one set of rules for certain people and a different set for others and you know kudos to Lisa McLeod I understand that when when mr. Hussein was using those words she left she's not gonna you know take these kind of potshots that she's uncontrollable just Ontario alone not counting the other provinces so far 174 million dollars and by the way that's a running total and every day another refugee or asylum seeker or migrant or whatever you want to call them heads to an int Aereo city or town so the province does indeed have skin in the game and again it's egregious to play the patriotism card to say that someone who wants stronger borders and a more responsible immigration system is therefore I'm Canadian and you know I gotta say this too for mr. Hussein and Justin Trudeau and Gerald butts and all the rest why not lead by example you know right now Toronto's shelter system is bursting at the seams because of illegals we even have hockey rinks that have been converted into refugee or migrant shelters we have university dorms that are currently vacant because the kids are on summer holiday right now housing migrants and the clock is literally ticking come Labor Day when it's time to put in the ice in those hockey rinks when it's time to welcome back the students to those dormitories where do those people go like I said the shelter system in Toronto is already at capacity this is grotesque Liberal mismanagement and I have to tell you folks next time you get your paycheck and you look at all those deductions just think of where a lot of your money right now is going and it doesn't have to be going there at all this is at the end of the day virtue signaling by Liberals and I totally disregard any criticism from the likes of butts and Hussein who say that speaking out against this horrible immigration policy that were saddled with right now is an act of racism or an alt right opinion or it is uncanny in' i think the the perverse the precise opposite is true folks that opening these borders to everyone and for any reason at all making Canada a sanctuary country I think that's on Canadian because how do we know the people that are coming here in this illegal fashion even subscribe to Canadian values yeah that's right I said it Canadian values I know that is a trigger for some people out there but that is the point of having strong border control and hopefully if and when there's regime change in Ottawa this can be rectified because I don't see anything moving forward and like I said the date to watch is Labor Day when the the rinks and the dormitories have to be used for their intended purposes or maybe not maybe I you know maybe that would be a Canadian thing a oh yeah the kids want to play ice hockey but you know what we have all these claimants that need a place to stay so um hey kids just say goodbye to your season you know well blame for the 2019 2020 season instead and so I'll go to the board and see what some of you have to say if I may and bear with me folks it seems to frozen again maybe one of my trained broadcast professionals can come in and I think we do have another clip by the way I did mention Lisa McLeod who said rightfully so that Hussein should apologize do we have that yep okay check it out what I saw here today was an attempt to talk him calling me uncanny in' which i take great offense to and i do hope he will apologize and reconsider his language i also won't be bullied into accepting what the federal government is doing because we do have severe and significant challenges inside the province of ontario so so with that was very clear that we would not sign the communique that there is a problem at the border it must the border must be enforced and that Ontario should be made whole for all of the costs that we have incurred and in addition to that I would just like to point out that the federal government has only promised us 11 million dollars and that has yet to flow so again that is insignificant inadequate and I'm calling on the provincial the federal government to reconsider I think maybe the Minister should sit down have a nice cup of tea calm down a little bit and maybe phone me and apologize for calling me on Canadian thank you beautiful I love that tough talk good good for you Lisa McLeod and yeah Minister who's saying why don't you take her up on that offer for a cup of tea and an apology on the side she certainly deserves it after such an egregious attack on her character I mean imagine that you're trying to do the responsible thing and you're being called on Canadian outrageous and I see we have a super chat from all a Larson Oh $100 thank you so much or is DKK not exactly a dollar do we know that is that some other foreign currency regardless of what it is I want to thank you very much for that generous donation and it's a question is as relevant in the United Kingdom right now oleh he is indeed we started the beginning of the show with news that Ezra will be at the Tommy trial tomorrow and or hearing I should say and he did get into the UK and by the way that wasn't a slam dunk folks those of you know that hey the likes of Lauren southern denied access and and so many others from going to the UK simply because they have a different political viewpoint or a viewpoint that might be you know kind of offensive to a certain minority group that we don't want to offend so therefore so much for freedom of speech you know it is so sad what's happened in the UK I tend to believe Ezra when he thinks we're maybe 10 or even 5 to 7 years away of this kind of action that we that we see in the UK basically shutting down debate that we don't like and you know it's not fear mongering on the behalf of Ezra motion m103 you know the just look at the wording of that taking a stance against racism and Islamophobia you know I'm always curious about that why why Islamophobia is the one form of racism if you will or bias that is segregated out there you know there there's nothing about anti-semitism you know hatred towards Sikhs Buddhists Christians you name it just Islamophobia and by the way we still don't have at this late hour a definition of what Islamophobia is anyways what's happened in Britain could happen here in the near future unless we take a stand and speak out against it oh and that the voice in my head says that was a twenty dollar clip so I want to thank you very much for that and by the way you know we should take a look at you know maybe one of the reasons a sanctuary country a nation that is there there is no such as any is no such thing as anyone being illegal is not such a good thing why don't we look south of the border at that Democratic panacea known as San Francisco you know the city by the bay a beautiful city I think San Francisco is one of the most beautiful and unique cities in the world haven't been there for many years not sure I want to go back given what I'm reading and what I'm seeing on YouTube but it is San Francisco is turning into a proverbial shite hole there's the headline on the New York Post San Francisco streets are littered with free syringes by the way who's where are these needles coming from yeah that's right the city of San Francisco and I have and that is not hype on that headline by the way folks there was a study done in terms of they were looking at the it's hard to read this trash feces and number of hypodermic drug needles in a 153 city block area of San Francisco and here are the results of the study from earlier this year there was trash on every block that's right all 153 blocks city blocks had trash secondly there were more than three hundred three hundred piles of human feces on ninety-six blocks so you know practically two thirds of that sample size were covered in feces how gross is that and they also found 100 drug needles on 41 blocks and that is a real deadly health hazard I mean if you get mistakenly stabbed by that kind of trash you better get yourself to a hospital very quickly and you know for those who are saying and by the way there there's a nice headline on The Daily wire what liberal pulse he's bring junkie showed up in public in Nancy Pelosi's home district now yeah you wouldn't see Nancy Pelosi walking through the streets of San Francisco she's going to be in some kind of bulletproof armored limousine I should think but if you do go on to YouTube you will see a series of tent cities just taking over this so-called sanctuary city now it's a disgrace and guess what in the department of foreshadowing is this where some Canadian cities are perhaps headed folks because I look at the Toronto Board of Health and yesterday the Toronto Board of Health voted to ask the federal government to explore options to fully legalize and regulate all drug use in Canada yeah that's right so all dried so what we're talking you know there you go from the Toronto Star decriminalized all drugs Toronto Health Board urges Ottawa I saw in the story to actually legalize which is a step further than decriminalize and is this where we are headed I mean Toronto is officially a sanctuary City and the vast majority of council I think when the vote was taken a few years ago voted for that I think only three councilors voted against that but now is this is this the route we're going are we going down the San Francisco route where it'll be the city handing out these syringes and by the way the vast majority of those needles found in that survey they were somehow able to identify them did indeed come from the Senate the city of San Francisco now you're looking at the video here Bart junkies say that Bart is of course an acronym for Bay Area Rapid Transit and I imagine that's a tunnel leading into the subway says to imagine walking through that especially if maybe you're by yourself and female in its nighttime does the word sanctuary City you know resonate there I mean it seems to be a sanctuary for some seems to be downright deadly for others and my god piles of human feces on 96 out of 153 city blocks and by the way we're not talking about the wrong side of the tracks in San Francisco a lot of these blocks where this study took place folks were in touristy areas so I would imagine that's gonna have a detrimental effect on tourism as time goes on and let's see we got another chat here from Tammy again Thank You Tammy Trudeau will expect students to keep intent to sleep in tents on campus until I can't read that where there flies in order to leave migrants in the dorms you know it's interesting Tammy that's what it boils down to doesn't it a when push comes to shove who's gonna get the the dormitories is there going to be the migrants or the students and with the way this Liberal government virtue signals I could see them making it a case for the migrants and maybe we'll see that on the campuses of certain universities ten cities created not for the migrants but for the students and you know what I think I support that the more I think about this I mean have these virtue signaling university students who think this is just you know the bee's knees what's going on in terms of immigration policy I wonder in January when it's minus thirty five with the windchill and you're living in a tent city with a generator you know pushing in what passes for central heating to keep you alive I wonder then if you have your little come-to-jesus moment in terms of immigration policy and sanctuary city so you know Tammy I'm gonna say good for the government if they do go ahead with that and we have a super chat from jolly jester five dollars thank you so much for your generosity jolly jester what do you think about the decision of Education Minister Lisa Thompson to include gender identity without parent parental consultation after the curriculum repeal you know I want to read into that because from what I see right now with the sex ed curriculum there seems to be you know and I'm not I'm not certain folks but because I want to see the final product there seems to be a lid wavering and flip-flopping there because I know when Doug Ford was on the campaign trail and I saw him personally speak about this on so many occasions one of the biggest Bugaboos about the new sex ed curriculum was the lack of parental consultation there was virtually nothing you know it was the wind government basically saying listen we know what we're doing and we have incredible eggheads on the team like Oh Ben Levin you remember Ben Levin he convicted for child pornography and creating child pornography he's one of the authors of the new sex ed curriculum yeah so all the tall forehead types know what they're doing so you parents even though it's your children we're the co parents we know what's best for them that was the narrative then I sure hope there is going to be a thorough consultation process with the parents regarding the new and hopefully improved sex ed curriculum that's going to come out of this PC government so let's see what that does and see and you know what folks you know this machine really hates me it is just frozen on the same chat and oh wait man I fixed it which is good because the train broadcast professionals who know what they're doing they always blame it on me and they're always right by the way there is some little button I always click that freezes up something but I think I've got it going again so my my apologies end see Paul greening rights none of these refugees are really refugees you know when you say the term none that that's the point I don't know if the number is zero I have to assume that maybe there are some genuine refugees and that's the thing if there are genuine refugees that are getting screwed by those who are gaming the system and by the way those who are gaming the system I fully believe are the vast majority of people you know I'm not being an apology for the left here my friend but then you know shouldn't the people who support genuine refugees be asking for tighter border controls too because if the genuine refugees are going to be kicked out along with the gamers then we've done them a disservice but I guess it doesn't work like that not when you subscribe to no one is illegal and this is a nation that should have open borders and if you say anything against that according to the Minister the Federal Minister of Immigration then you are on Canadian incredible ok then and Amanda joy writes Canadians are always being scolded like children for not playing nice you know I have to agree I mean how much more nice can you get then then Canadians I mean in terms of our immigration policy basically we say no we don't say no to anyone and that's why we're in this financial sinkhole and who knows what the societal costs are going to be in the years ahead that will be interesting to keep an eye on and miss little peg writes irregular is what Hussein calls them someone passed the pepto you know what you're absolutely right we're not even allowed to use terms like illegal alien or illegal immigrant irregular I remember doing a commentary on this last year and I basically I used to think folks that irregular was what you called a pair of socks that had some kind of you know manufacturers error and I remember bringing in a pair of high end fashion socks the original price were was $16 well it'll be a cold day in Hades before the men's ID buys a pair of socks for 16 dollars but because they were irregular I think I was able to buy them for two dollars and I couldn't tell where the irregularity was but yeah that's what I use the term irregular for to describe a you know a manufactured pair of socks that isn't 100% perfect now we're supposed to use the word irregular for somebody who is actually illegal these guys in Ottawa can't even say the word illegal so if they can't even use the proper terminology how are we ever gonna hope to solve this problem with this crew in Ottawa in the first place and Paul greening writes we have plenty of homeless already you know yes we do Toronto and for that matter San Francisco very expensive cities to live in there are poor people there are the working poor there are so many people right now I would argue that are one you know little calamity away like you know the transmission on their car blowing or you know some kind of unexpected financial event happening in their household that are you know just one event away from getting into serious financial trouble and yet we're supposed to have the wherewithal to take care of all these people many of whom we don't even know who they are or what they're about absolutely terrible and see pke racing notes that hockey is racist you know what I'm sure we live in a world now where you could dismiss that remark as being ludicrous but I bet you somebody in on campus in the months and years away when they've they've run out of causes they'll probably go after hockey as being racist I mean hockey right now is and you know for most of its inception has been a very white sport not that it's closed off to any kind of visible minorities but the very fact that it is predominantly white would make it racist whereas the NBA being wrongly black well that wouldn't make it racist because being predominately of another race other than white is good so you are right I can see that argument being made and here we have from Blaine Sandberg most federal liberal politicians do not care thus do not listen to the average Canadian about this illegal immigrant issue the they consistently dismiss it as an uncontrolled words as I said earlier on Gerald Butz said this is essentially you know the ideology from the out right and the Minister of Immigration mr. Hussein said you don't agree with what we're doing you are therefore uncontained again it's outrageous and it's egregious and it should not be tolerated let's see I think we're running out of time here and how about we ended on this Valkyrie Sardo writes that the con balloon ever get off the ground not to my knowledge I know there was a fundraising campaign for it and guys do we have that hilarious photoshopped image of the the baby con balloon over the skyline of London yeah this was the the answer to the baby Donald Trump balloon there you go giant Sadiq Khan baby balloon to fly over London I for one would love to see that in the air like I said here yesterday whoever has the temerity to put that into the skies of the UK you are probably going to get charged with a hate crime and do some hard time because that kind of balloon that's offside because of who the mayor is a Donald Trump balloon that's completely legit and by the way when we use terms like giant an enormous and colossal let's keep in mind that Trump balloon it was not even 20 feet tall I mean it was like the size of a small bouncy castle so a whole lot of heap and help in of fake news there and folks it is one o'clock thank you so so much for tuning in I will be here tomorrow I'm hoping to get the computer technology a little better down pat I want to thank you all so much for tuning in and I want to thank everyone who gave donation and the super chat a big hearty thank you as well folks that's it for battleground today see you tomorrow and remember without risk there can be no glory good afternoon you
