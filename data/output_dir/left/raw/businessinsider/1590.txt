Charles Darwin taught us that evolution

00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,540
is a slow and steady process of natural

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,680
selection but in the last 100 years

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,090
humans have been changing abnormally

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,000
fast for example the first humans who

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,610
lived around 200,000 years ago died

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,420
around age 20 it took nearly 2,000

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,640
centuries to double life expectancy to

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,580
40 years by 1850 but it only took

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,109
another one and a half centuries to

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,630
almost double that again today the
