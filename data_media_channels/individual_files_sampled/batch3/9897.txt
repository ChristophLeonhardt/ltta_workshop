♪ ♪ Martha: CELEBRITY TRUMPET NEMESIS ROSIE O'DONNELL UNDER FIRE TONIGHT FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE ANY LESS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION TO AT LEAST FIVE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES EXCEEDING THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED UNDER CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW. SHE APPARENTLY IS UNFAZED BY THE REPERCUSSIONS POSTING IN A TWEET TODAY. "ALL MY DONATIONS, MY GOAL IS TO SUPPORT ALTHOUGH SUPPOSED TO TRUMP." HERE NOW GINA LOWDEN, PSYCHOLOGY EX-PAT AND CREATOR OF THE NONPROFIT THEY ALL HAVE NAMES AND JESSICA TARLOV. I LOVE HOW ROSIE SAYS I MAKE MOST OF THEM LATE AT NIGHT WHEN I'M DEPRESSED AND I JUST GO ON AND KEEP GETTING THE DONATE, DONATE, DONATE BUTTON. BUT DINESH D'SOUZA DID BASICALLY THE SAME THING, HE SPENT EIGHT MONTHS IN A HALFWAY HOUSE. JESSICA, DOES ROSIE DESERVE THE SAME SENTENCE? I THINK WE NEED ALL THE FACTS OF THE CASE HERE. IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS USING MULTIPLE ALIASES TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS TO DONATE TO ADAM SCHIFF AND CONNOR LAM AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS. WHAT DINESH D'SOUZA DID WAS TO GO OVER THE LIMIT HIMSELF AND ALSO RECRUIT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE DONATING. Martha: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? HE'S ASKING PEOPLE TO DO IT FOR THEM. AS A LEAD WITH, WE NEED TO KNOW ALL THE DETAILS HERE BUT I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY DINESH D'SOUZA WOULD BE WANTING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND A HALFWAY HOUSE SOUNDS JUST AS THAT IS PRESENT TO ME. Martha: IT'S ONLY HALFWAY IS BAD, STILL PRETTY BAD. JUST AS THE LAWYER HERE BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S IMPORTANT THE LAW IS APPLIED CONSISTENTLY HERE. I CAN UNDERSTAND, THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS ARE VERY CONFUSING AND IF I'M REALLY HONEST I THINK IT IS CONFUSING ENOUGH THAT PERHAPS THE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF RESPONDING WHATEVER IS NOT USED. FOR THE SAKE OF CONSISTENCY YOU JUST KNOW THAT IF THIS WERE ROSEANNE DONATING TO TRUMP INSTEAD OF ROSIE DRUNK DONATING TO DEMOCRATS SHE WOULD BE MAKING A LOT OF NOISE OUT ABOUT IT THING WE SHOULD THROW THE BOOK AT THEM. Martha: I WANT TO PLAY THIS SOUND BITE FOR YOU FROM MICHELLE OBAMA AND GET YOUR THOUGHTS. LET'S PLAY IT. IF WE AS WOMEN ARE STILL SUSPICIOUS OF ONE ANOTHER. IF WE STILL HAVE THIS CRAZY, CRAZY BAR FOR EACH OTHER THAT WE DON'T HAVE FOUR MEN, IF WE ARE STILL DOING THAT TODAY, IF WE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE IF WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE NOTION THAT A WOMAN COULD BE OUR PRESIDENT COMPARED TO, WHAT? Martha: THERE WE HAVE, AGAIN, THE SAME SORT OF ASSUMPTION THAT HILLARY CLINTON MADE THAT ANY WOMAN WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP BASICALLY REJECTED HER AFFINITY FOR WOMEN OR FOR WOMEN CANDIDATES OR SHE VOTED LIKE HER DAD OR HER HUSBAND OR HER BOSS TOLD HER TO LIKE WE HEARD FROM HILLARY. GINA. I HAD A 50/50 CHANCE OF COMING OUT BEING A WOMAN. I DON'T CONSIDER IT AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. YOU CONTRAST THIS WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL FIRST LADY NOW AND THERE'S JUST NO COMPARISON. THIS IS ALL ABOUT DIVISIVENESS AND TO SAY THE WORDS SHE SAID THAT FOR SOME REASON WE SHOULD VOTE FOR WOMAN SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN AND TO CONDESCEND THE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP'S, ON ITS FACE, SEXIST. SPEEONE SHE ACTUALLY DIDN'T SAY THAT. I AGREE WITH HALF OF YOUR POINT. SHE DIDN'T SAY YOU COULD VOTE FOR HER JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN. SHE SAID IN HER PREVIOUS SOUND BITE, SHE SAID I'M CONCERNED ABOUT US AS WOMEN, WHAT WE THINK ABOUT OURSELVES, EACH OTHER, WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR HEADS THAT WE LET THAT HAPPEN. LET THAT HAPPEN IS ELECTING SOMEONE TO HIS OFFICE WHO IS ESPOUSING AND PROMOTING POLICIES THAT DON'T HELP WOMEN AND ALSO SOMEONE WHO TALKS ABOUT THE WOMEN WE ALL REMEMBER MRS. PEGGY, MRS. HOUSEKEEPING, WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ROSIE BEFORE. THIS IS A MAN WHO DEMEANS WOMEN. SHE WAS TALKING AT ALL WOMAN WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP. WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THAT SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW WOMEN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO THIS PERSON IS, HIS CHARACTER, HOW HE TREATS WOMEN, EVEN HIS OWN WIFE. SHE WAS SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE VOTED FOR HILLARY SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE IS, THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.
