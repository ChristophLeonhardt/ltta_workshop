786
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,925
GOING DOWN. 

787
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:27,992
AND THEY SAID, OUR OTHER 

788
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,827
PRESIDENTS, I WON'T BE 

789
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,528

THEY WOULD COME, THEY WOULD 

794
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:38,870
MAKE A SPEECH, THAT SAYS -- 

795
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,604
WOULD YOU PLEASE PAY A LITTLE 

796
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:39,904

NEXT ONE WOULD COME, YOU KNOW,

NATO, THEY DON'T PAY ANY MONEY, 

801
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,180
WE ARE DEFENDING EUROPE. 

802
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,648
COULD YOU PLEASE PAY A LITTLE 

803
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:51,248

THEY DON'T PAY! 

811
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,955
THE NEXT ONE COMES, SAME THING. 

812
00:30:57,955 --> 00:30:59,591
AND I CAME AND I SAID, FELLAS, 

813
00:30:59,591 --> 00:30:59,991

814
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,225
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY. 

815
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:08,099
YOU GOT TO PAY!  

816
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:13,438
-- YOU'RE DELINQUENT. 

817
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,172
AND ONE OF THE LEADERS SAID, 

818
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,707
WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, COULD I 

819
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,774
ASK YOU A QUESTION? 

820
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,143
IF WE DON'T PAY, WHAT ARE YOU 

821
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,679
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? 

822
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,648
I SAID, DO YOU WANT PROTECTION 

823
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,183
OR NOT? 

824
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:32,223
DO YOU WANT PROTECTION OR NOT? 

825
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,658
SO I SAID TO MY WIFE, YOU KNOW, 

826
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,325
I JUST RAISED LIKE A COUPLE OF 

827
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:39,563
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS, AND IT 

828
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:40,298
WAS LIKE, SO EASY. 

829
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:44,736
IT WAS SO EASY. 

830
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,170
I SAID, HONEY, WAIT TILL YOU 

831
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,538
SEE THE PRESS I GET ON THIS, 

832
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,339
IT'S COMING. 

833
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,709
GOING TO BE GREAT! 

834
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,045
AND HERE'S WHAT THE FAKE NEWS 

835
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:54,245
SAID. 

836
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:54,512
LARGELY. 

837
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,782
THEY SAID, DONALD TRUMP, OUR 

838
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:05,823
PRESIDENT, WAS EXTREMELYRUDE! 

839
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,358
TO PRESIDENTS AND PRIME 

840
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:07,958
MINISTERS AND IN A COUPLE OF 

841
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,327
CASES, DICTATORS, BUT THAT'S 

842
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:09,694
ALL RIGHT. 

843
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,629
THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS VERY 

844
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,798
RUDE. 

845
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,667
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE MONEY 

846
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,970
I RAISED. 

847
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,837
I WAS RUDE. 

848
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,371
AND I WASN'T. 

849
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,439
ACTUALLY, I HAVE A BETTER 

850
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,573
RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERY ONE OF 

851
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,708
THEM THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT 

852
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,043
HAS HAD. 

853
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:25,576
EVERY ONE. 

854
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,545
>> [ APPLAUSE ]

855
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,881
>> AND THEY RESPECT US AGAIN. 

856
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,951
THEY RESPECT US AGAIN. 

857
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:41,692
SO NATO IS VERY WELL-FUNDED, 

858
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:42,927
THESE COUNTRIES ARE STARTING TO 

859
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:43,394
 

860
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,429
GOT TO PAY UP! 

861
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,030
FOLKS, YOU GOT TO PAY UP. 

862
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,265
YOU KNOW, WE WENT THROUGH THE 

863
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,032
ENTIRE ROOM, AND THE LAST 

864
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:48,999
GENTLEMEN, A PRIME MINISTER, 

865
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:49,934
SAID, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL 

866
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,769
SAYING HOW WONDERFUL EVERYTHING 

867
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,903
IS, BUT I DON'T THINK THE 

868
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:56,741
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

869
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:57,508
IS HAPPY. 

870
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,108
NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT. 

871
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,578
AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, 

872
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:01,646
PRESIDENT, THIS IS BEFORE THEY 

873
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,748
MADE THE COMMITMENT, I SAID, 

874
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:11,589
PRESIDENT, ARE YOU HAPPY, TO 

875
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:11,755
ME? 

876
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:13,324
I SAID, NO, THANK YOU FOR 

877
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:13,691
BRINGING IT UP. 

878
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,993
THIS IS AFTER THEY WENT THROUGH 

879
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,293
28 PEOPLE. 

880
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,728
I SAID, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 

881
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,161
BRINGING IT UP. 

882
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:17,862
AND THIS GENTLEMAN, MAYBE 

883
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,297
THEY'LL FIND A TRANSCRIPT, HE 

884
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,966
SAID, WE GOT TO MAKE THE 

885
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,201
PRESIDENT HAPPY. 

886
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,401
THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO BE 

887
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:26,771
HAPPY IS YOU GOT TO PAY YOUR 

888
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,104
BILLS, FOLKS. 

889
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,005
YOU GOT TO PAY YOUR BILLS. 

890
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:28,873
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS 

891
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,641
NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO SPEND 

892
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,878
OUR MONEY, OUR SWEAT, OUR TEARS,

893
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:39,617
OUR BLOOD, ON PEOPLE THAT 

894
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:40,351
AREN'T. I 

895
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,053
DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, AND 

896
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,120
I SAID TO THEM AS A ROOM, I 

897
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,422
SAID, I'M ALL FOR NATO. 

898
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:50,495
ONE THING I KNOW, IS THAT NATO, 

899
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,763
WHICH PROTECTS EUROPE, IS 

900
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,097
BETTER FOR EUROPE THAN IT IS 

901
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,432
FOR THE UNITED STATES. 

902
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,499
WE ARE WAY FAR AWAY. 

903
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:56,400
YOU LISTEN TO SOME OF THE 

904
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,735
GENERALS, SIR, THEY ARE AN 

905
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:57,968
ALLY. 

906
00:33:57,968 --> 00:33:58,903
WE MUST PROTECT THEM. 

907
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,239
THEY ARE A LONG WAY AWAY. 

908
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,072
I'M ALL FOR NATO. 

909
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:06,043
YOU KNOW WHY? 

910
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,010
BECAUSE NOW THE MONEY IS 

911
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,778
POURING IN. 

912
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:08,911
AND THEY SAID I TREATED THEM 

913
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,947
BADLY. 

914
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,382
AND I DIDN'T. 

915
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:13,583
I HAVE SUCH A GREAT 

916
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:14,851
RELATIONSHIP -- SO I'M VERY 

917
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:15,185
PROUD OF IT. 

918
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:16,753
WHEN I WOKE UP, I SAID THIS IS 

919
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:19,123
GOING TO BE GREAT, FINALLY, I'M 

920
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:19,255
 

921
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:20,257
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT.

00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,721
HEY, LOOK, THERE'S PEOPLE, NICE 

1283
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:31,688
PEOPLE, THEY'RE RELAXING, SOME 

1284
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,856
ARE JOGGING, BEAUTIFUL PARK 

1285
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:33,790
ALONG THE HUDSON RIVER -- HE 

1286
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,658
DECIDES TO KILL THEM. 

1287
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,994
SO HE MAKES A RIGHT TURN, HE 

1288
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,763
KILLED EIGHT, AND MANY ARE JUST 

1289
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:40,764
DECAPITATED. 

1290
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,399
THEY LOST ARMS, THEY LOST LIMBS,

1291
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,834
THEY LOST SO MUCH. 

1292
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:48,605
THEY LOST THEIR LIFE. 

1293
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:49,473
BUT THEY LOST SO MUCH. 

1294
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,074
YOU KNOW, NOBODY EVER TALKS 

1295
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,876
ABOUT THE SERIOUSLY INJURED 

1296
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:53,110
PEOPLE. 

1297
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:53,910
THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE 

1298
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,479
PEOPLE THAT DIED. 

1299
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,114
IN SOME CASES, THOSE ARE THE 

1300
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:57,414
LUCKY ONES. 

1301
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,183
WHAT HAPPENS WITH SOME OF THESE 

1302
00:47:00,183 --> 00:47:01,184
PEOPLE, HOW BADLY INJURED THEY 

1303
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:04,321
ARE, THEIR LIVES ARE SO BADLY 

1304
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,257
DESTROYED -- AND THIS ANIMAL 

1305
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:08,091
KILLED EIGHT, AND HE WOUNDED 

1306
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:11,328
EIGHT OR NINE, SOME ARE STILL IN

1307
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,763
THE HOSPITAL -- THAT WAS A YEAR 

1308
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:16,200
AND A HALF AGO -- AND HE CAME IN

1309
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,636
THROUGH CHAIN -- AND HE HAS 22 

1310
00:47:20,636 --> 00:47:23,573
RELATIVES HERE THAT CAME IN 

1311
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:27,811
BECAUSE HE WAS HERE. 

1312
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,513
HE HAS HIS UNCLE AND HIS AUNT, 

1313
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,781
AND HE HAS HIS GRANDFATHER, SO 

1314
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,617
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. 

1315
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,153
AND WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT. 

1316
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,055
AND HERE'S THE LAST -- WE HAVE 

1317
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:40,323
TO CHANGE -- WE HAVE TO CHANGE 

1318
00:47:40,323 --> 00:47:43,627
A THING CALLED CATCH AND 

1319
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,695
RELEASE. 

1320
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,595
THIS IS LIKE, FOR STUPID 

1321
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:45,963
PEOPLE. 

1322
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,131
CATCH AND RELEASE. 

1323
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,099
SOMEBODY WALKS ACROSS THE 

1324
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:53,670
BORDER, THEY PUT -- NOT EVEN 

1325
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,172
TWO FEET, JUST ONE FOOT -- AND 

1326
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,208
YOU MIGHT AS WELL -- WELCOME TO 

1327
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,943
THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL 

1328
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,145
NEVER GET YOU OUT OF HERE. 

1329
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:02,345
OKAY? 

1330
00:48:02,345 --> 00:48:03,480
REMEMBER WHEN I SET ABOUT A 

1331
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,615
MONTH AGO -- I SAID, NO, THEY 

1332
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,651
WANT ME TO HIRE THOUSANDS OF 

1333
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:07,884
JUDGES. 

1334
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:08,184
THOUSANDS. 

1335
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:11,622
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE CORRUPTION 

1336
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,689
THAT WOULD TAKE PLAC? 

1337
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,858
HIRING THOUSANDS -- YOU GO INTO 

1338
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,592
A BARBERSHOP, AND YOU WORRY -- 

1339
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:18,128
ANYBODY WANT TBE A JUDGE? 

1340
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,630
THEY WANT ME TO HIRE THOUSANDS 

1341
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,899
OF -- I SAID, WE DON'T NEED 

1342
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,532
JUDGES. 

1343
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,334
WE NEED BORDER PATROL. 

1344
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:30,774
WE NEED BORDER PATROL. 

1345
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,575
IF YOU HAVE A HOUSE, AND 

1346
00:48:32,575 --> 00:48:37,047
SOMEBODY GOES TO SLEEP ON YOUR 

1347
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,715
LAWN AND YOU SAY, SORRY, FOLKS, 

1348
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:39,148
GET OUT OF HERE. 

1349
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:40,416
IF YOU CALL THE POLICE, THEY'RE 

1350
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:43,387
GOING TO REMOVE -- IT'S YOUR 

1351
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,021
LAWN, THIS IS OUR COUNTRY, THIS 

1352
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:45,955
IS OUR COUNTRY. 

1353
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:50,660
GET THE HELL OUT. 

1354
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,262
AND WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL BUT 

1355
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,163
WE HAVE REALLY BAD LAWS. 

1356
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,065
WE ARE SETTING RECORD NUMBERS 

1357
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,099
IN TERMS OF POSITIVE STUFF BUT 

1358
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,601
WE HAVE BAD LAWS. 

1359
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,502
SO CATCH AND RELEASE, YOU CATCH 

1360
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,638
THEM, NOW YOU TAKE HIS NAME, 

1361
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,373
AND THEN YOU RELEASE HIM. 

1362
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,109
AND HE IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP 

1363
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,010
TO A COURT HEARING. 

1364
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,780
THE PROBLEM IS, THERE'S 

1365
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,347
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 

1366
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:15,085
PEOPLE -- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 

1367
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,421
JUDGES -- BUT HOPEFULLY THE

1368
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:17,988
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL GET 

1369
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:24,795
MOVING ON THAT -- HOPEFULLY -- 

1370
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,562
COME ON, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, 

1371
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,564
GET US SOME JUDGES OVER THERE, 

1372
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:27,897
FOCUS, FOCUS. 

1373
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,700
SO THEY COME BACK THREE OR FOUR 

1374
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,970
YEARS LATER, BUT HERE'S THE 

1375
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,272
PROBLEM. 

1376
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:38,375
THEY NEVER COME BACK! 

1377
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,376
THEY DON'T COME BACK. 

1378
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,012
WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY COME 

1379
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:42,212
BACK? 

1380
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,680
SO A VERY TINY PERCENTAGE COMES 

1381
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:43,880
BACK. 

1382
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,949
SO YOU CATCH A STONE COLD 

1383
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,017
CRIMINAL. 

1384
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:51,721
YOU TAKE HIS NAME, YOU SEE HE'S 

1385
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:52,321
A CRIMINAL. 

1386
00:49:52,321 --> 00:49:59,029
YOU SEE HE'S BAD IN MANY CASES. 

1387
00:49:59,029 --> 00:49:59,895
CATCH AND RELEASE. 

1388
00:49:59,895 --> 00:50:01,598
YOU CATCH HIM AND YOU THEN 

1389
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:01,931
RELEASE HIM. 

1390
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:02,666
AND HE NOW GOES INTO YOUR 

1391
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,399
WONDERFUL TOWNS. 

1392
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:04,801
HE NOW COMES TO THE WONDERFUL 

1393
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:08,772
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. 

1394
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:09,672
CATCH AND RELEASE! 

1395
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:10,273
WE HAVE TO END IT. 

1396
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,074
SO WE HAVE TO END CATCH AND 

1397
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:12,341
RELEASE. 

1398
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:13,743
WE HAV TO END OUR LOTTERY 

1399
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:13,977
SYSTEM. 

1400
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,612
AND WE HAVE TO END CHAIN 

1401
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:15,912
MIGRATION. 

1402
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,315
AND WE HAVE TO BUILD THE WALL 

1403
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:23,720
AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IT. 

1404
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,125
AND BOB CASEY IS AGAINST EVERY 

1405
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,861
ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST SAID. 

1406
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,728
HE WANTS THE LOTTERY SYSTEM. 

1407
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:33,997
HE WANTS CHAIN MIGRATION. 

1408
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,566
BY THE WAY, IF YOU ASK HIM WHY, 

1409
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:42,405
HE WANTS IT BECAUSE SCHUMER 

1410
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:43,273
SAID TO HAVE IT. 

1411
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,908
THEY THINK IT'S GOOD 

1412
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:45,241
POLITICALLY. 

1413
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:46,576
I TELL YOU WHAT, I THINK IT'S 

1414
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:47,410
HORRIBLE POLITICALLY. 

1415
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,211
WHAT DO I KNOW? 

1416
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,345
I DID BECOME PRESIDENT IN LIKE 

1417
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:50,413
A YEAR AND A HALF. 

1418
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:56,520
SO WE NEED REPUBLICANS, WE NEED 

1419
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,988
LOU BARLETTA. 

1420
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:58,321
HE IS TOUGH. 

1421
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,324
WE NEED LOU BARLETTA. 

1422
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:02,826
WE DO. 

1423
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:07,297
HE'S TOUGH. 

1424
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,000
THEY ARE LIKING YOU, LOU. 

1425
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,004
THEY'RE LIKING YOU. 

1426
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,805
I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT A 

1427
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:17,573
LONG TIME -- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO 

1428
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:19,342
IS MEET HIM, SEE HIM -- I HEAR

DEBATE LOU BARLETTA. 

1431
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:26,183
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DEBATE HIM. 

1432
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,651
I HEAR HE'S AFRAID TO DEBATE. 

1433
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:27,984
IS THAT TRUE? 

1434
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,386
I HEAR HE'S AFRAID TO DEBATE. 

1435
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,287
I WANT TO WATCH THAT DEBATE. 

1436
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,754
I WANT TO BE -- IS THE

ALLOWED TO COME INTO THE DEBATE 

1439
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:36,626

00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,764
HE IS -- IS HE ALLOWED TO SIT

00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,832
IN THE FRONT ROW WATCHING LOU 

1443
00:51:42,832 --> 00:51:47,204
BARLETTA DESTROY IN THE DEBATE 

1444
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:47,504
BOB CASEY? 

1445
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:51,341
AM I ALLOWED TO -- BECAUSE IF I 

1446
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:51,774
AM, I'LL BE THERE. 

1447
00:51:51,774 --> 00:51:52,843
I'LL BE THERE. 

1448
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,645
THAT WILL BE GREAT 

1449
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:56,146
ENTERTAINMENT. 

1450
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,280
THAT WILL BE GREAT 

1451
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,647
ENTERTAINMENT. 

1452
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,549
I'VE SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE. 

1453
00:51:59,549 --> 00:51:59,849
HE'S TOUGH. 

1454
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:01,918
SO I WANT TO THANK REPUBLICAN 

1455
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,986
LEADERSHIP, BECAUSE AMERICA IS 

1456
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:08,325

00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,960
>> [ APPLAUSE ] 

1458
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,662

00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:16,166
WEEK WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S.

00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,634
ECONOMY GREW AT 4.1% LAST 

1461
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:17,900
QUARTER. 

1462
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,769
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS 

1463
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:23,506
POSSIBLE. 

1464
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:25,075
AND IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT IN, 

1465
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,978
THAT NUMBER WOULD BE 1.2, IT 

1466
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,479
COULD EVEN TURN NEGATIVE. 

1467
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,348
IT WAS GOING TO GO DOWN. 

1468
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,049
WE WERE SET -- BECAUSE OF THE 

1469
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:33,382
REGULATIONS. 

1470
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:34,884
IT WAS -- WE WERE BEING CHOKED. 

1471
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:37,821
DON'T FORGET, I APPROVED THE 

1472
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,589
KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE. 

1473
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:43,627
AND I APPROVED THE DAKOTA 

1474
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:44,828
ACCESS PIPELINE. 

1475
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,129
48,000 JOBS. 

1476
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,666
IN, LIKE, MY FIRST FEW HOURS IN 

1477
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:54,504
OFFICE. 

1478
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,574
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE'VE ADDED 

1479
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,242
A NUMBER THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE 

1480
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,443
BELIEVED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE 

1481
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,747
NEVER SAID ON THE CAMPAIGN 

1482
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:04,713
TRAIL, I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT 

1483
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:06,349
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE DONE A 

1484
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,350
BIG NUMBER ON ME. 

1485
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:07,917
3.7MILLION NEW JOBS. 

1486
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:14,324
INCLUDING CLOSE TO 400,000 JOBS 

1487
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,026
IN THE MANUFACTURING WORLD. 

1488
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:16,293
REMEMBER? 

1489
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:20,697
REMEMBER? 

1490
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,564
REMEMBER WHEN THEY SAID 

1491
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:24,867
MANUFACTURING IS DEAD? 

1492
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:25,101
IT IS? 

1493
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,369
WHO'S GOING TO MAKE THINGS? 

1494
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:34,644
I MEAN, TELL ME. 

1495
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:35,712
MANUFACTURING IS DEAD THEY 

1496
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:35,912
SAID. 

1497
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:36,913
WE'VE ADDED 400,000 INCREDIBLE 

1498
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:37,113
JOBS. 

1499
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,448
YOU'VE HEARD THIS BUT I'M GOING 

1500
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:40,083
TO SAY IT OVER AND OVER BECAUSE 

1501
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,083
I'M REALLY PROUD OF IT. 

1502
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,485
REMEMBER I SAID WHAT DO YOU 

1503
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:42,818
HAVE TO LOSE? 

1504
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:44,187
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 

1505
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:44,721
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, SO MANY 

1506
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,724
OTHERS, I SAID, WHAT DO YOU 

1507
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,826
HAVE TO LOSE? 

1508
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,328
YOU HAVE HIGH CRIME RATES, YOU 

1509
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:51,928
HAVE HORRIBLE EDUCATION, YOU 

1510
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,096
HAVE THIS -- I WENT THROUGH A 

1511
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,764
LIST OF 10, THAT'S WHAT 

1512
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:55,031
HAPPENED. 

1513
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,366
AND I LOOKED AND I SAID, YOU'VE 

1514
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,767
BEEN TOTALLY GIVING YOUR VOTES 

1515
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:58,668
TO DEMOCRATS, THEY'VE LET YOU 

1516
00:53:58,668 --> 00:53:58,868
DOWN. 

1517
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,403
I SAID, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU 

1518
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,371
HAVE TO LOSE? 

1519
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,673
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1520
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:06,209
THIS NEW ELECTION -- CERTAINLY 

1521
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:13,783
THE NEXT ONE -- WHERE WE ARE 

1522
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:14,851
GOING TO HAVE IT JUST KEEP 

1523
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,419
AMERICA GREAT -- I TELL YOU, I 

1524
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,520
LOVE THOSE HATS, BUT THEY'RE 

1525
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,289
GOING TO BE -- YOU KNOW, MAKE 

1526
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:19,756
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

1527
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,723
WILL MORPH INTO KEEP AMERICA 

1528
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:22,926
GREAT, EXCLAMATION POINT. 

1529
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,396
BUT DON'T LOSE THOSE HATS. 

1530
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,364
THEY'LL BE VERY VALUABLE 

1531
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,666
SOMEDAY. 

1532
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,800
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

1533
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,668
MAYBE THE GREATEST SLOGAN EVER, 

1534
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,436
RIGHT? 

1535
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:37,874
RONALD REAGAN HAD ONE, LET'S 

1536
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:38,307
MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 

1537
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:39,075
I LIKE IT. 

1538
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:39,909
BUT OURS IS BETTER. 

1539
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,511
I LIKE OURS BETTER. 

1540
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:45,148
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THE AFRICAN-

1541
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:46,583
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS 

1542
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:51,388
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE 

1543
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:51,921

NUMBER, I REALLY THINK THAT'S 

1547
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,998
HARD FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO BEAT. 

1548
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,533
THINK OF THAT STATEMENT. 

1549
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,635
I GOT THE LOWEST NUMBER FOR YOU 

1550
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,005
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1551
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:09,939
HOW DO YOU TOP THAT? 

1552
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,007
LET'S SAY I'M RUNNING AGAINST 

1553
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:16,045
POCAHONTAS OR CRAZY BERNIE. 

1554
00:55:16,045 --> 00:55:18,281
I TELL YOU, I GOT TO HAND IT TO 

1555
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:18,514
BERNIE. 

1556
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:21,885
I SAW HIM UP THERE THE OTHER 

1557
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:24,720
DAY -- THAT HAIR IS GETTING 

1558
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,654
WHITER AND WHITER AND HE'S 

1559
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:27,123
GETTING CRAZIER AND CRAZIER -- 

1560
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:31,628
AND I SAW HIM -- WE'LL STOP 

1561
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,996
DONALD TRUMP, WE ARE STOPPING 

1562
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,363
THEM, WE'RE GOING TO STOP -- 

1563
00:55:34,363 --> 00:55:35,832
AND I LOOKED AT MY WIFE, I 

1564
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,367
SAID, YOU KNOW IT, YOU GOT TO 

1565
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,469
HAND IT TO THAT GUY, HE DOESN'T 

1566
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:39,702
QUIT. 

1567
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:40,103
AND THAT'S OKAY. 

1568
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:40,836
CRAZY BERNIE. 

1569
00:55:40,836 --> 00:55:44,908
HE IS ONE CRAZY DUDE. 

1570
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,643
SO I DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE GOING

1571
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:47,744
TO RUN AGAINST. 

1572
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,445
I DON'T KNOW. 

1573
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:56,752
BUT WHEN BERNIE TELLS WONDERFUL 

1574
00:55:56,752 --> 00:55:58,221
THINGS -- THINK OF IT, HE WANTS 

1575
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,689
TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, HE WANTS TO

1576
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,757
CREATE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF 

1577
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:01,991

1578
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:02,926
BORDERS, THINK OF IT, JUST 

1579
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,360

-- AND I SAY ONE THING -- 

1581
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:06,863
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC, 

1582

WHAT HAPPENED? 

1595
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:40,630
I HAD NOTHING LIKE THAT. I

00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:53,342

INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE MOST 

1618
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,640

00:57:56,338 --> 00:58:02,045
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. 

1641
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,012
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS A 

1642
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:03,746
DISASTER. 

1643
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:04,246
SOUNDS GOOD -- LIKE THE 

1644
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:05,448
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 

1645
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:05,881
WAS NOT AFFORDABLE. 

1646
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:07,283
REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON GOT 

1647
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:09,151
UP AND SAID THE PROBLEM WITH 

1648
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:11,654
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS THAT 

1649
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,190
IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE. 

1650
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,290
AND THEN YOU DIDN'T HEAR FROM 

1651
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,193
HIM FOR TWO WEEKS BECAUSE HE 

1652
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,629
GOT THE HELL KNOCKED OUT OF HIM 

1653
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:24,634
BY CROOKED HILLARY. 

1654
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:25,067
>> [ APPLAUSE ] 

1655
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:27,069
>> FOR TWO WEEKS, HE WENT DEAD 

1656
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:28,304
SILENT, THEY WOULDN'T LET HIM 

1657
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:34,243
OUT OF THE HOUSE. 

1658
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:34,877
THE WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, 

1659
00:58:34,877 --> 00:58:37,547
I'M SORRY, WOMEN,  ! IS THE 

1660
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,616
LOWEST IN ONLY 65 YEARS. 

1661
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:39,949
NOT HISTORY. 

1662
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,951
SORRY. 

1663
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:44,153
BUT IT WILL BE LOW SOON. 

1664
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,189
SO 65 YEARS. 

1665
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,459
65 YEARS, BUT I WOULD ALMOST 

1666
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,294
BET WITHIN TWO WEEKS OR THE 

1667
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,929
NEXT TIME THIS INCREDIBLE 

1668
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,598
STATISTICAL GROUP IS RELAXED 

1669
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:58,001
AND RELEASED -- I WOULD SAY 

1670
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,301
THAT PROBABLY THE WOMEN WILL BE 

1671
00:58:59,301 --> 00:58:59,936
HISTORICAL -- RIGHT? 

1672
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:00,603
RIGHT? 

1673
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:03,272
I THINK SO. 

1674
00:59:03,272 --> 00:59:07,744
BUT AT 65 YEARS, I'M DOING MY 

1675
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,913
BEST. 

1676
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:14,951
52% -- OH, THE WOMEN LIKE ME, 

1677
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:15,218
YOU KNOW? 

1678
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,486
>> [ APPLAUSE ]

1679
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:19,222
>> THEY LIKE ME. 

1680
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:26,596
THEY LIKE ME. 

1681
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:27,897
I KEEP HEARING -- LOOK AT ALL 

1682
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,731
THOSE SIGNS, PINK SIGNS WITH 

1683
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,799
THE WOMEN, LOOK AT THAT. 

1684
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:30,600
LOOK AT THAT. 

1685
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,001
THE WOMEN HAVE BEEN GREAT. 

1686
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,103
AND I THINK THEY ARE 

1687
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:38,675
INCREDIBLE. 

1688
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,076
THEY HAVE A HARDER JOB THAN ALL 

1689
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,711
OF US, FELLAS, LET ME TELL YOU, 

1690
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:42,712
THE WOMEN ARE GREAT. 

1691
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,048
AND WE DID GREAT WITH THE 

1692
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:45,281
WOMEN. 

1693
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:45,948
IN FACT, I REMEMBER ON ELECTION 

1694
00:59:45,948 --> 00:59:47,617
NIGHT, THEY SAID, HOW THE HELL 

1695
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,686
DID THIS HAPPEN? 

1696
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:50,652
REMEMBER THEY WERE GIVING YOU 

1697
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:51,754
PHONE NUMBERS ON THAT TOO? 

1698
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:55,291
THE VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 

1699
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,193
HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 

1700
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,062
18 YEARS AND THAT'S GOING TO GO 

1701
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,231
UP -- MORE THAN

1702
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:05,601
3.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 

1703
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:08,971
LIFTED OFF FOOD STAMPS. 

1704
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:12,375
MORE THAN 4 MILLION AMERICANS 

1705
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,009
ARE GOING TO RECEIVE JOB 

1706
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:15,010
TRAINING UNDER OUR NEW 

1707
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:19,749
WORKFORCE INITIATIVE. 

1708
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:23,252
MANUFACTURING, CONSUMER AND 

1709
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:26,355
BUSINESS CONFIDENCE HAS REACHED 

1710
01:00:26,355 --> 01:00:30,259
THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE 

1711
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,327
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1712
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:34,430
I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 

1713
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,398
CONFIDENCE IS A GOOD THING. 

1714
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:39,602
HAVING CONFIDENCE -- WHAT DO 

1715
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,872
YOU THINK, HAVING CONFIDENCE IS 

1716
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:43,172
GOOD, YEAH? 

1717
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,073
IF YOU HAVE CONIDENCE AND YOU 

1718
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,507
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU 

1719
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:46,075
CAN'T LOSE. 

1720
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,644
THAT'S A GREAT STAT. 

1721
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,578
THINK OF IT. 

1722
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:51,748
ESSENTIALLY, BUSINESS, THE MOST 

1723
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,549
CONFIDENT IN OUR COUNTRY. 

1724
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:53,849
IT'S GREAT. 

1725
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:56,785
THE UNITED STATES IS NOW A NET 

1726
01:00:56,785 --> 01:00:57,886
NATURAL GAS EXPORTER FOR THE 

1727
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:01,390
FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 60 

1728
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,726
YEARS. 

1729
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,260
AND PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS ARE 

1730
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,462
LEADING THE WAY. 

1731
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:07,263
YOU ARE LEADING THE WAY. 

1732
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:10,032
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVEN KNOW 

1733
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:10,232
THAT. 

1734
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:12,835
RIGHT? 

1735
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,637
NOW THAT WE HAVE THE BEST 

1736
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,373
ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

1737
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,942
COUNTRY, THIS IS THE TIME TO 

1738
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:20,843
STRAIGHTEN OUT THE WORST TRADE 

1739
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:24,680
DEALS EVER MADE BY ANY COUNTRY 

1740
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:31,654
ON EARTH AT ANY TIME. 

1741
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,790
FOR GENERATIONS, PENNSYLVANIA 

1742
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,491
STEEL AND PENNSYLVANIA COAL 

1743
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:39,395
MADE THIS STATE THE CENTER OF 

1744
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:43,532
THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD. 

1745
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:44,833
THE WORKERS OF SCRANTON AND 

1746
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,970
BETHLEHEM AND ALLENTOWN AND 

1747
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:52,141
WILKES-BARRE WERE THE BACKBONE 

1748
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:56,078
OF AMERICAN MIGHT. 

1749
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:56,746
THEY REALLY WERE. 

1750
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,649
THE BACKBONE OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1751
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,618
THE BACKBONE OF AMERICAN 

1752
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:03,051
STRENGTH AND MIGHT. 

1753
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:05,054
BUT THE LOYALTY OF OUR WORKERS 

1754
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:09,692
WAS REPAID WITH BETRAYAL. 

1755
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:12,729
YOU ARE BETRAYED BY OUR 

1756
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,062
POLITICIANS. 

1757
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:17,800
YOU WERE BETRAYED BY THE PEOPLE 

1758
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,767
THAT RAN OUR COUNTRY. 

1759
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:19,769
BUT YOU'RE NOT BETRAYED 

1760
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:27,743
ANYMORE. 

1761
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:31,547
PENNSYLVANIA LOST 300 MENU -- 

1762
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:32,114
300,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

1763
01:02:32,114 --> 01:02:33,983
AND CHINA JOINED THE WTO. 

1764
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,519
RIGHT NOW CHINA IS NOT TOO 

1765
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:37,319
HAPPY WITH ME. 

1766
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:41,591
BUT I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR 

1767
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:41,924
PRESIDENT XI. 

1768
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,326
AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR 

1769
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:43,559
CHINA. 

1770
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,694
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THAT OUR 

1771
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:50,967
LEADERS WERE STUPID. 

1772
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,503
FOR DECADES, OUR POLITICIANS 

1773
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,738
RAN FOR OFFICE, PLEDGING TO 

1774
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:59,742
CRACK DOWN ON UNFAIR TRADE. 

1775
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,978
BUT THEY NEVER DID IT. 

1776
01:03:02,978 --> 01:03:04,714
BUT ONCE ELECTED, THEY DID 

1777
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:05,281
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND OUR 

1778
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,650
WORKERS AND OUR COUNTRY GOT 

1779
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,319
RIPPED OFF LIKE NO COUNTRY EVER 

1780
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,822
BEFORE, IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

1781
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:14,523
WORLD. 

1782
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:15,224
WE GOT RIPPED OFF. 

1783
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,760
IT WAS A MASSIVE, MASSIVE 

1784
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,629
TRANSFER OF WEALTH TO OTHER 

1785
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,930
COUNTRIES. 

1786
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,499
THE POLITICIANS JUST WATCHED AS 

1787
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:26,102
OTHER COUNTRIES STOLE OUR JOBS, 

1788
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,037
PLUNDERED OUR WEALTH, AND 

1789
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:31,641
LOOTED THE CROWN JEWELS OF THE 

1790
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,041
AMERICAN ECONOMY. 

1791
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:36,111
BUT I AM NOT ANOTHER 

1792
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:36,746
POLITICIAN. 

1793
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:38,014
I KEEP MY PROMISES TO THE 

1794
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,749
PEOPLE. 

1795
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:40,750
I DIDN'T NEED THIS. 

1796
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,617
I DIDN'T NEED THIS. 

1797
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:45,321
I DIDN'T NEED IT! 

1798
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,956
I HAD A VERY NICE LIFE. 

1799
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:52,361
I DIDN'T NEED -- YOU KNOW, I 

1800
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:53,896
USED TO ACTUALLY GET GOOD 

1801
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,631
PRESS. 

1802
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:56,064
I DIDN'T NEED THIS. 

1803
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:56,431
BUT I LOVE IT. 

1804
01:03:56,431 --> 01:03:57,599
I LOVE IT BECAUSE WE ARE DOING 

1805
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,101
THINGS THAT ARE HISTORIC. 

1806
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,503
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN -- EVEN 

1807
01:04:01,503 --> 01:04:02,972
THESE PEOPLE BACK HERE, THESE 

1808
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,140
HORRIBLE, HORRENDOUS PEOPLE -- 

1809
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,440
EVEN THESE PEOPLE BACK THERE -- 

1810
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,143
LOOK, LOOKS LIKE THE ACADEMY 

1811
01:04:08,143 --> 01:04:09,945
AWARDS OR SOMETHING, YOU EVER 

1812
01:04:09,945 --> 01:04:12,615
SEE THIS? 

1813
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,150
IS THIS THE ACADEMY AWARDS 

1814
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,618
YOU'RE DOING? 

1815
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:19,855
EVEN THESE PEOPLE, THEY SAY, 

1816
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,557
PROBABLY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS 

1817
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,792
COUNTRY, MAYBE IN THE HISTORY 

1818
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:23,392
OF THE WORLD, THERE HAS NEVER 

1819
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:24,827
BEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED

1820
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,729
IN NOVEMBER. 

1821
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:30,800
OF '16. 

1822
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,600
PROBABLY NEVER. 

1823
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,133
PROBABLY NEVER HAPPENED. 

1824
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:34,036
PROBABLY NEVER HAPPENED. 

1825
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,638
I REALLY BELIEVE THERE'S NEVER 

1826
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:46,148
BEEN -- I REMEMBER WATCHING ONE 

1827
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,249
AND WE WERE STARTING TO DO 

1828
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:48,818
REALLY WELL AND THAT LASTED TWO 

1829
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:49,051
WEEKS. 

1830
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:49,885
I HAD CROWDS LIKE THIS 

1831
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:50,886
EVERYWHERE, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 

1832
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:51,821
OUTSIDE, THEY COULDN'T GET IN, 

1833
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,622
I SAID, WHY ARE WE GOING TO 

1834
01:04:53,622 --> 01:04:53,823
LOSE? 

1835
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,124
HILLARY WOULD COME IN AND HAVE 

1836
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:55,758
350 PEOPLE. 

1837
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:58,293
SHE WOULD BRING IN BEYONCE, AND 

1838
01:04:58,293 --> 01:05:01,830
THEN JAY-Z WOULD GET UP AND USE 

1839
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:02,698
LANGUAGE SO BAD. 

1840
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,600
IF I EVER USED THAT LANGUAGE I 

1841
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,235
WOULD BE RUN OUT OF THE 

1842
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:06,501
COUNTRY. 

1843
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:07,737
THEY SAY TRUMP'S LANGUAGE IS 

1844
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,772
VERY TOUGH. 

1845
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:10,506
DID YOU EVER HEAR JAY-Z? AND 

1846
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:11,607
SHE WOULD BRING IN BRUCE 

1847
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:11,940
SPRINGSTEEN. 

1848
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:14,076
AND THEN DRAW CROWDS -- THEY 

1849
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,777
WERE DRAWING CROWDS, SMALLER 

1850
01:05:15,777 --> 01:05:18,981
THAN MY CROWDS. 

1851
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,782
AND I SAID WHY ARE WE GOING TO 

1852
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:21,484
LOSE? 

1853
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:21,851
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1854
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:22,151
WE DIDN'T. 

1855
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:22,752
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS 

1856
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,320
INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY 

1857
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:29,724
STARTED OFF BY SAYING WE 

1858
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:31,527
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS 

1859
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:31,994
SINCE RONALD REAGAN. 

1860
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:34,763
I LIKE RONALD REAGAN. 

1861
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:37,633
AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND 

1862
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:40,870
BIGGER AND WILDER AND WILDER. 

1863
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,672
AND THEN WE WON BY A LOT. 

1864
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:45,241
DON'T FORGET IT WAS 306-223. 

1865
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,510
THAT'S A LOT. 

1866
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,777
REMEMBER? 

1867
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,714
THERE IS NO WAY, ACCORDING TO 

1868
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:57,453
FAKE NEWS CNN, THERE IS NO WAY 

1869
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,021
FOR TRUMP TO GET TO 270. 

1870
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,589
THERE IS NO PATH. 

1871
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:01,957
REMEMBER THE EXPRESSION? 

1872
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:03,692
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE IS 

1873
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:11,434
NO PATH FOR DONALD TRUMP TO GET 

1874
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:11,667
TO 270. 

1875
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,669
NO, THERE WASN'T, BUT 306 WAS 

1876
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:13,969
NO PROBLEM. 

1877
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:19,275
>> [ APPLAUSE ]

1878
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:25,948
>> SO AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING 

1879
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:29,819
OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY 

1880
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:36,358
REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY. 

1881
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:39,662
IN THE NUMBERS THAT WERE JUST 

1882
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,431
RELEASED, THE REPORTERS DIDN'T 

1883
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,800
COVER THIS ONE, TO ME, IT WAS 

1884
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,035
MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE 

1885
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,369
4.1 BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE 

1886
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:48,537
DOING A LOT BETTER THAN THE 4.1 

1887
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:51,307
AS THINGS GO -- FOR THE FIRST 

1888
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,009
TIME, MAYBE, EVER, THE TRADE 

1889
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:56,512
DEFICIT JUST FELL -- THINK OF 

1890
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,515
THAT -- BY -- FOR THE QUARTER --

1891
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,917
$52 BILLION. 

1892
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,785
NOBODY REPORTS IT! 

1893
01:07:03,785 --> 01:07:05,721
WHY DON'T YOU REPORT THAT? 

1894
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:13,762
JUST FELL BY $52 BILLION. 

1895
01:07:13,762 --> 01:07:14,930
AND BECAUSE OF OUR ECONOMIC 

1896
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:21,670
PLANNING AND OUR CHARGING TAXES 

1897
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,203
OR TARIFFS TO ALL OF THE 

1898
01:07:22,203 --> 01:07:23,071
DUMPERS OF STEEL ALL OVER OUR 

1899
01:07:23,071 --> 01:07:26,342
COUNTRY, AMERICA'S STEEL MILLS 

1900
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:31,847
ARE ROARING AGAIN. 

1901
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,816
OUR COUNTRY IS BEING RESPECTED 

1902
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:34,183
AGAIN! 

1903
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:35,951
BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING 

1904
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:42,892
AMERICA FIRST. 

1905
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:43,726
>> [ APPLAUSE ] 

1906
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:50,366
>> WE'VE ELIMINATED A RECORD 

1907
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:51,032
NUMBER OF JOB CRUSHING 

1908
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:51,366
REGULATIONS. 

1909
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:53,135
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 

1910
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,037
FROM THE UNFAIR AND VERY, VERY 

1911
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:58,474
EXPENSIVE FOR OUR COUNTRY PARIS 

1912
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:02,011
CLIMATE ACCORD. 

1913
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:05,214
SO UNFAIR. 

1914
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:09,118
THAT WAS ANOTHER GREAT RIPOFF. 

1915
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,085
REPUBLICANS JUST PASSED THE 

1916
01:08:10,085 --> 01:08:13,022
BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN THE HISTORY 

1917
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:17,158
OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1918
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:21,630
AND THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO LIFT 

1919
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,798
THEM WAY UP. 

1920
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:23,165
REMEMBER THAT. 

1921
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:27,703
WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE, THEY WANT 

1922
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,571
TO END YOUR TAX CUTS AND THEY 

1923
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:31,707
WANT TO LIFT IT UP SO THEY CAN 

1924
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:32,374
WASTE YOUR MONEY

1925
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:33,943
ON A LOT OF NONSENSE. 

1926
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,010
AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE SAVED 

1927
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,580
OUR FAMILY FARMS AND OUR SMALL 

1928
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,581
BUSINESSES FROM THE ESTATE TAX, 

1929
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:41,716
ALSO KNOWN AS

1930
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:44,620
THE DEATH TAX. 

1931
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,890
NO LONGER THE DEATH TAX. 

1932
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,425
NO LONGER WILL THEY PAY THE 

1933
01:08:50,425 --> 01:08:52,127
ESTATE TAX. 

1934
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:56,332
OUR FAMILY FARMERS -- THE 

1935
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,433
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS GONE, THE 

1936
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:01,136
PENALTY IS GONE, THROUGH 

1937
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:01,803
ASSOCIATED HEALTH PLANS, YOU 

1938
01:09:01,803 --> 01:09:02,904
KNOW THAT, THE ASSOCIATION 

1939
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:04,773
HEALTH PLANS ARE GIVING US AND 

1940
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,743
ALLOWING AMERICANS TO JOIN 

1941
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,944
FORCES TO BUY MUCH BETTER 

1942
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:14,049
HEALTHCARE FOR A FRACTION OF 

1943
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:14,750
THE COST. 

1944
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,385
AND YOU CAN GO CROSS STATE 

1945
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:19,020
LINES AND NEGOTIATE WITH 

1946
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,087
EVERYBODY YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE 

1947
01:09:20,087 --> 01:09:23,559
WITH. 

1948
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:30,332
WE'VE INVESTED A RECORD $700 

1949
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:30,865
BILLION IN OUR MILITARY. 

1950
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:33,636
AND $716 BILLION NEXT YEAR, WE 

1951
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:34,837
ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. 

1952
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,139
WITH THE FINEST PLANES, THE 

1953
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,642
FINEST MISSILES, THE FINEST 

1954
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:41,810
SHIPS, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 

1955
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:45,447
WE HAD TO DO IT, WE HAD TO DO 

1956
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:46,048
IT. 

1957
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:47,182
AND THEY'RE ALL MADE IN THE 

1958
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:47,381
USA. 

1959
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:49,818
FOLKS, JOBS TOO. 

1960
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:51,654
IN THAT CASE, MUCH LESS 

1961
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,023
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THERE'S 

1962
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,158
NOTHING SO IMPORTANT AS 

1963
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:57,459
PROTECTION AND OUR MILITARY. 

1964
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:04,600
BUT IN THIS CASE, THE ONLY TIME 

1965
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,934
SECONDARILY -- IT'S CALLED JOBS 

1966
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:07,136
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS EQUIPMENT 

1967
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:08,137
AND ALL OF THESE BRILLIANT 

1968
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:09,204
PLANES THAT EVERYBODY -- THEY 

1969
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:10,706
WANT TO BUY -- ALL OF THEM -- 

1970
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,173
WE HAVE A BACKLOG -- WE MAKE 

1971
01:10:12,173 --> 01:10:13,742
THE GREATEST MILITARY EQUIPMENT 

1972
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:14,409
IN THE WORLD, WE MAKE THE 

1973
01:10:14,409 --> 01:10:15,644
GREATEST JETS, WE MAKE THE 

1974
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,980
GREATEST CHIPS, WE MAKE THE 

1975
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:18,413
GREATEST MISSILES. 

1976
01:10:18,413 --> 01:10:20,449
WE HAVE THE ANTIMISSILE 

1977
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,051
MISSILES THAT SHOOT DOWN 

1978
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,020
MISSILES. 

1979
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,121
MANY, MANY MILES AWAY IN THE 

1980
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:28,223
SKY LIKE A NEEDLE IN A 

1981
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:29,024
HAYSTACK. 

1982
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,627
THEY SHOOT THEM DOWN. 

1983
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:34,897
HARD TO BELIEVE. 

1984
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,031
AND WE ARE SURROUNDING OUR 

1985
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,566
COUNTRY WITH THEM, BY THE WAY, 

1986
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,033
IF YOU DON'T MIND. 

1987
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:39,201
REMEMBER WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES 

1988
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:43,639
SAID WE DON'T WANT YOU TO PUT 

1989
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:51,647
DEFENSIVE MISSILES -- IN YOUR 

1990
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,648
COUNTRIES -- YOU DON'T WANT US 

1991
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,048
TO POST -- EXPLAIN THAT TO ME 

1992
01:10:54,048 --> 01:10:54,516
PLEASE. 

1993
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:54,783
REMEMBER? 

1994
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:55,650
THEY USED TO GET ANGRY. 

1995
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:56,918
WHEN WE WOULD PUT DEFENSIVE 

1996
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:58,420
MISSILES, ANTIMISSILE MISSILES 

1997
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,890
IN OUR COUNTRY -- SO WE 

1998
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:02,891
WOULDN'T DO IT. 

1999
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:03,191

01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:05,740
SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER THIS 

2181
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,175
WEEK ABOUT THE

2182
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:07,942
PRESIDENT'S RALLY IN FLORIDA, 

2183
01:19:07,942 --> 01:19:11,078
YOU SAID THAT THESE EVENTS ARE 

2184
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:12,046
SOMETIMES EASY TO CHALK UP AS 

2185
01:19:12,046 --> 01:19:13,215
THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER 

2186
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:14,749
BUTTHAT IS NOT THE CASE. 

2187
01:19:14,749 --> 01:19:16,718
DID YOU GET THAT SAME KIND OF 

2188
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:19,921
FEELING THEIR IN PENNSYLVANIA? 

2189
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:20,154
>> YES. 

2190
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:23,891
ELAINE, I GOT TO TELL YOU, THE 

2191
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:25,827
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US IS 

2192
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:28,096
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW. 

2193
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,632
PROBABLY MY 80th TRUMP RALLY. 

2194
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:31,767
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THIS 

2195
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,969
BUILDING AND I'VE BEEN HERE 

2196
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:39,107
BEFORE -- IT HAS A MASSIVE ECHO 

2197
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:39,641
EFFECT. 

2198
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:41,343
SO I CAN BARELY HEAR A SINGLE 

2199
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:41,976
WORD YOU ARE SAYING. 

2200
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:43,345
I MADE OUT ENOUGH OF WHAT YOU 

2201
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:44,512
ASKED TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER. 

2202
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:46,114
BUT I CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING 

2203
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,649
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME. 

2204
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,217
LET'S CARRY ON. 

2205
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,518
SO THIS IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 

2206
01:19:50,518 --> 01:19:52,187
RALLY THAN THE FLORIDA RALLY. 

2207
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:58,260
IN FLORIDA, DONALD TRUMP WAS 

2208
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,628
INSERTING HIMSELF INTO A 

2209
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:00,294
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY THAT IS 

2210
01:20:00,294 --> 01:20:01,029
CONTESTED. 

2211
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,697
AND HE WAS MAKING HIMSELF THE 

2212
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:03,898
CENTER OF AN INTRAPARTY FEUD. 

2213
01:20:03,898 --> 01:20:04,666
WHICH HAD ITS OWN DYNAMICS. 

2214
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:14,175
HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, THERE'S 

2215
01:20:14,175 --> 01:20:15,776
NOT THAT KIND OF INTRAPARTY 

2216
01:20:15,776 --> 01:20:16,344
FEUD GOING ON. 

2217
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:17,512
AND HE IS HERE FOR LOU 

2218
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:18,246
BARLETTA, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE 

2219
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:19,380
RUNNING FOR SENATE AGAINST BOB 

2220
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:19,614
CASEY. 

2221
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:21,116
WELL ORGANIZED RALLY, LOTS OF 

2222
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:21,549
LOU BARLETTA SIGNS. 

2223
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:22,751
LOU BARLETTA GOT HIS TIME, AT 

2224
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,486
THE PODIUM AS RON DeSANTIS DID, 

2225
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:27,822
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAVORITE 

2226
01:20:27,822 --> 01:20:29,190
CANDIDATE FOR THE NOMINATION IN 

2227
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:29,457
FLORIDA. 

2228
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:31,593
HERE, IT WAS MUCH MORE OF 

2229
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:34,562
LARGER REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM, 

2230
01:20:34,562 --> 01:20:35,730
AND PRO-TRUMP ENTHUSIASM FOR 

2231
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,066
SURE. 

2232
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:39,166
ONE THING IS SIMILAR ABOUT THE 

2233
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:41,603
RALLIES I'VE BEEN TO THIS WEEK, 

2234
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:42,703
THE AUDIENCE FEELS A DEEPER 

2235
01:20:42,703 --> 01:20:44,138
SENSE OF SATISFACTION THAN THEY 

2236
01:20:44,138 --> 01:20:46,207
DID DURIN THE CAMPAIGN. 

2237
01:20:46,207 --> 01:20:49,043
AS THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID, I 

2238
01:20:49,043 --> 01:20:50,912
WAS PROMISING YOU THINGS BACK 

2239
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:52,814
IN 2016 -- I'M DELIVERING ON 

2240
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:54,015
THEM NOW. 

2241
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,518
AND FOR THE CROWD THAT'S HERE, 

2242
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:01,656
THAT IS A VERY POWERFUL 

2243
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:02,390
COMBINATION. 

2244
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,990
THEY BELIEVED BACK THEN, THEY 

2245
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:03,724
FEEL THAT SENSE OF VINDICATION 

2246
01:21:03,724 --> 01:21:04,125
NOW. 

2247
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,760
AND THE FASCINATING QUESTION 

2248
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,828
FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTION WILL 

2249
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:11,666
BE, DOES THAT SENSE OF 

2250
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:14,636
VINDICATION, COMPETITIVE

2251
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:15,203
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OR 

2252
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:16,771
COMPETITIVE SENATE RACE 

2253
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:19,507
TRANSLATE INTO SOMETHING LARGER 

2254
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:22,444
THAT WE MIGHT EXPECT? 

2255
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:23,645
DOES THE TRUMP EFFECT WORK DOWN 

2256
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,447
BALLOT? 

2257
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:26,580
AND THE REASON THAT'S A REALLY 

2258
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,583
IMPORTANT QUESTION IS NOT JUST 

2259
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:29,617
THE MAJORITY FOR REPUBLICANS IN 

2260
01:21:29,617 --> 01:21:31,018
THE HOUSE AND SENATE, BUT 

2261
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:34,422
REMEMBER, IN 2016, PRESIDENT 

2262
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:35,523
TRUMP WON, WE ALL REMEMBER 

2263
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:35,723
THAT. 

2264
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:39,794
BUT IN A STATE WHERE REPUBLICAN 

2265
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:43,565
SENATORS ALSO WON FREQUENTLY, 

2266
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:44,466
THOSE REPUBLICAN SENATORS MARCO 

2267
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:45,467
RUBIO AND FLORIDA, RON JOHNSON 

2268
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:49,270
IN WISCONSIN, OTHERS, RAN AHEAD 

2269
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:51,740
OF THE VOTE COUNT FOR DONALD 

2270
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,207
TRUMP. 

2271
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,009
SO THEY WERE OKAY BY 

2272
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:55,010
THEMSELVES. 

2273
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:55,844
IT WASN'T DONALD TRUMP'S 

2274
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:56,745
COATTAILS THAT BROUGHT THEM 

2275
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,112
INTO THE SENATE. 

2276
01:21:58,112 --> 01:22:02,083
SO IN THE MIDTERM CYCLE NOW, 

2277
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,652
WHAT IS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE 

2278
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,054
TRUMP EFFECT IN COMPETITIVE 

2279
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:07,021
RACES, HOUSE AND SENATE, WHERE 

2280
01:22:07,021 --> 01:22:11,859
HE IS NOT ON THE BALLOT? 

2281
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:13,328
WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT. 

2282
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:14,562
BUT RALLIES LIKE THIS REMIND ME 

2283
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,264
THAT THE TRUMP EFFECT IS STRONG,

2284
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,933
THE TRUMP EFFECT IS REAL, AND 

2285
01:22:18,933 --> 01:22:19,901
PEOPLE WHO SHOW

2286
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:22,537
UP AT THESE RALLIES AS I 

2287
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:28,376
LEARNED IN 2015, ARE -- CAN BE 

2288
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:29,477
RELIABLY EXPECTED TO SHOW UP TO 

2289
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,813
VOTE. 

2290
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:34,115
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND 

2291
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:34,916
ABOUT THE POWER OF THESE 

2292
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:35,884
RALLIES, AND IF I WERE A 

2293
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,185
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, I WOULD 

2294
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:39,320
TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE 

2295
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,121
PRESIDENT'S COMMITMENT TO 

2296
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,956
CAMPAIGN FREQUENTLY. 

2297
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:46,027
DURING THE MIDTERM CYCLE. 

2298
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:47,629
HE IS PICKING UP THE PACE. 

2299
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,531
AND IF HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME 

2300
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:50,431
ON THE ROAD, THE TRUMP EFFECT 

2301
01:22:50,431 --> 01:22:53,969
COULD BE REAL AND COULD BE 

2302
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,637
SIGNIFICANT FOR REPUBLICAN 

2303
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,472
PROSPECTS. 

2304
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:00,475
>> MAJOR GARRETT FOR US IN 

2305
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:01,042
WILKES-BARRE, PENNSYLVANIA, 

2306
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:02,844
THANKS FOR SOLDIERING THROUGH 

2307
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:03,945
THOSE ACOUSTIC CHALLENGES. 

2308
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,613
ONE MORE THING, GO AHEAD. 

2309
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:09,517
>> YEAH. 

2310
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:10,184
IT'S WILKES-BARRE. 

2311
01:23:10,184 --> 01:23:11,719
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WRONG, 

2312
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:13,855
IT'S WILKES-BARRE. 

2313
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:15,657
HE SAID -- I USED TO SAY WILKES-

2314
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:15,890
BARRE. 

2315
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,927
BUT PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU, 

2316
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:19,594
WILKES-BARRE. 

2317
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:20,361
>> WE CALLED THE CHAMBER OF 

2318
01:23:20,361 --> 01:23:21,129
COMMERCE. 

2319
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:22,397
THE PRODUCERS ARE TELLING THE 

2320
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:25,767
CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE SAYS 

2321
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:26,367
"WILKS BARE." 

2322
01:23:26,367 --> 01:23:27,134
>> THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN 

2323
01:23:27,134 --> 01:23:29,737
INTERN. 

2324
01:23:29,737 --> 01:23:31,406
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN INTERN. 

2325
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,608
>> WE ARE GOING TO GET TO THE 

2326
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:33,975
BOTTOM OF THIS. 

2327
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:34,809
MORE TO COME, OKAY, THANK YOU 

2328
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:35,910
SO MUCH, MAJOR GARRETT. 

2329
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,444
>> THANK YOU. 

2330
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:39,080
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 

2331
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:39,580
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

2332
01:23:39,580 --> 00:00:00,000
