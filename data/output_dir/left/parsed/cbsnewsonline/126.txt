APPLAUSE ] TRUTHFULLY, IT'S 
BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD, MY LIPS 
STUCK. 
 SO IN HIS 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, HE DESCRIBES A 
HAPPY CHILDHOOD. 
HE WAS LOOKING AFTER CATTLE AND 
PLAYING WITH THE OTHER BOYS. 
EVENTUALLY, HE ATTENDS A SCHOOL 
WHERE HIS TEACHER GAVE HIM THE 
ENGLISH NAME, NELSON. 
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, HIS QUOTED 
AS SAYING WHY SHE BESTOWED THIS 
PARTICULAR NAME UPON ME, I HAVE 
NO IDEA. 
THERE WAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE 
THAT A YOUNG BLACK BOY AT THIS 
TIME IN THIS PLACE COULD, IN 
ANY WAY, ALTER HISTORY. 
AFTER ALL, SOUTH AFRICA WAS 
LESS THAN A DECADE REMOVED FROM 
A FULL BRITISH CONTROL. 
ALREADY LAWS WERE BEING 
CODIFIED. 
TO IMPLEMENT RACIAL SEGREGATION 
AND SUBJUGATION. 
THE NETWORK OF LAWS THAT WOULD 
BE KNOWN AS APARTHEID. MOST OF 
AFRICA, INCLUDING MY FATHER'S 
HOMELAND, WAS UNDER COLONIAL 
RULE. 
THE DOMINANT EUROPEAN POWERS 
HAVING ADDED A HORRIFIC WORLD 
WAR JUST AFTER HIS BIRTH. 
THEY VIEWED THIS CONTINENT AND 
PEOPLES AS SPOILS OF THE 
TERRITORY AND ABUNDANT NATURAL 
RESOURCES AND CHEAP LABOR. 
AND THE INFERIORITY OF THE 
BLACK RACE, AND INDIFFERENCE 
TOWARDS BLACK CULTURE AND 
INTERESTS AND ASPIRATIONS WAS A 
GIVEN. 
SUCH A VIEW OF THE WORLD, THAT 
CERTAIN RACES, CERTAIN NATIONS, 
CERTAIN GROUPS WERE INHERENTLY 
SUPERIOR, AND THAT OF VIOLENCE 
AND COERCION ARE THE PRIMARY 
BASES FOR GOVERNMENTS, BUT THE 
STRONG NECESSARILY EXPLOIT THE 
WEEK -- WEAK, THAT WAS HARDLY 
CONFINED TO RELATIONS BETWEEN 
EUROPE AND AFRICA OR RELATIONS 
BETWEEN WHITES AND BLACKS. 
WHITES WERE HAPPY TO EXPLOIT 
OTHER WHITES WHEN THEY COULD. 
AND BY THE WAY, BLACKS WERE 
OFTEN WILLING TO EXPLOIT OTHER 
BLACKS. 
AND AROUND THE GLOBE, A 
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIVED AT 
SUBSISTENCE LEVELS. OFTEN THEY 
WERE SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS AND 
CRUELTIES OF DISTANT LEADERS. 
THE AVERAGE PERSON SAW NO 
POSSIBILITY OF ADVANCING FROM 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR 
BIRTH. 
WOMEN WERE ALMOST UNIFORMLY 
SUBORDINATE TO MEN, PRIVILEGE 
AND STATUS WAS RIGIDLY BOUND BY 
CASTE AND COLOR AND ETHNICITY. 
AND RELIGION. 
AND EVEN IN MY OWN COUNTRY, 
EVEN IN DEMOCRACIES LIKE THE 
UNITED STATES FOUNDED ON A 
DECLARATION THAT ALL MEN ARE 
CREATED EQUAL, RACIAL 
SEGREGATION AND SYSTEMIC 
DISCRIMINATION WAS THE LAW AND 
ALMOST HALF THE COUNTRY. 
IT WAS THE NORM THROUGHOUT THE 
REST OF THE COUNTRY. 
THAT WAS THE WORLD JUST 100 
YEARS AGO. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY 
WHO WERE ALIVE IN THAT WORLD. 
IT IS HARD TO OVERSTATE THE 
REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATIONS THAT 
HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THAT 
TIME. 
A SECOND WORLD WAR, EVEN MORE 
TERRIBLE THAN THE FIRST, ALONG 
WITH A CASCADE OF LIBERATION 
MOVEMENTS FROM AFRICA TO ASIA, 
LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST 
WOULD FINALLY BRING AN END TO 
COLONIAL RULE. 
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE'S HAVING 
WITNESSED THE HORRORS OF 
TOTALITARIANISM, THE REPEATED 
MASS SLAUGHTERS OF THE 20th 
CENTURY BEGAN TO EMBRACE A NEW 
VISION FOR HUMANITY, A NEW 
IDEA, ONE BASED NOT ONLY ON THE 
PRINCIPLE OF NATIONAL SELF-
DETERMINATION BUT ALSO ON THE 
PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND 
RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL RIGHTS 
AND THE INHERENT DIGNITY OF 
EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. 
THOSE NATIONS WOULD MARK A 
BASED ECONOMIES, SUDDENLY UNION 
MOVEMENT DEVELOPED AND HEALTH 
AND SAFETY AND COMMERCIAL 
REGULATIONS WERE INSTITUTED AND 
ACCESS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION WAS 
EXPANDED AND SOCIAL WELFARE 
SYSTEMS EMERGED, ALL WITH THE 
AIM OF CONSTRAINING THE 
EXCESSES OF CAPITALISM AND 
ENHANCING ITS ABILITY TO 
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST TO 
SOME BUT TO ALL PEOPLE. 
THE RESULT WAS UNMATCHED 
ECONOMIC GROWTH. 
AND THE GROWTH OF THE MIDDLE 
CLASS. 
AND IN MY OWN COUNTRY, THE 
MORAL FORCE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS 
MOVEMENT, NOT ONLY OVERTHREW 
JIM CROW LAWS, BUT IT OPENED UP 
THE FLOODGATES FOR WOMEN AND 
HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS
TO REIMAGINE THEM SELVES, TO 
FIND THEIR OWN VOICES AND MAKE 
THEIR OWN CLAIMS TO FULL 
CITIZENSHIP. 
IT WAS IN SERVICE OF THIS LONG 
WALK TOWARDS FREEDOM AND JUSTICE
AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY THAT 
NELSON MANDELA DEVOTED HIS LIFE.
AT THE OUTSET, HIS STRUGGLE WAS 
PARTICULAR TO THIS PLACE, TO 
HIS HOMELAND. 
A FIGHT TO END APARTHEID. 
A FIGHT TO ENSURE LASTING 
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC EQUALITY FOR ITS 
DISENFRANCHISED NONWHITE 
CITIZENS. 
BUT THROUGH HIS SACRIFICE AND 
UNWAVERING LEADERSHIP AND 
PERHAPS, MOST OF ALL, THROUGH 
HIS MORAL EXAMPLE, MANDELA AND 
THE MOVEMENT HE LED WOULD COME 
TO SIGNIFY SOMETHING LARGER. 
HE CAME TO EMBODY THE UNIVERSAL 
ASPIRATIONS OF DISPOSSESSED 
PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. 
THEIR HOPES FOR A BETTER LIFE, 
THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORAL 
TRANSFORMATION IN THE CONDUCT 
OF HUMAN AFFAIRS. 
HIS LIGHT SHONE SO BRIGHTLY 
EVEN FROM THAT NARROW ROBIN 
ISLAND CELL, IN THE LATE 70s HE 
COULD INSPIRE A YOUNG COLLEGE 
STUDENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE WORLD TO RE-EXAMINE HIS OWN 
PRIORITIES. 
HE COULD MAKE ME CONSIDER THE 
SMALL ROLE I MIGHT PLAY IN 
BENDING THE ARK OF THE WORLD 
TOWARDS JUSTICE. 
AND WHEN LATER AS A LAW 
STUDENT, I WITNESSED HIM EMERGE 
FROM PRISON JUST A FEW MONTHS, 
YOU WILL RECALL, AFTER THE FALL 
OF THE BERLIN WALL. 
I FELT THE SAME WAVE OF HOPE 
THAT WASH THROUGH HEARTS ALL 
ALONG THE WORLD. 
YOU REMEMBER THAT FEELING. 
IT SEEMED AS IF THE FORCES OF 
PROGRESS WERE ON THE MARCH, 
THAT THEY WERE INEXORABLE. 
EACH STEP HE TOOK, YOU FELT 
THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN THE OLD 
STRUCTURES OF VIOLENCE AND 
REPRESSION AND ANCIENT HATREDS 
THAT HAD SO LONG STUNTED 
PEOPLE'S LIVES AND CONFINED THE 
HUMAN SPIRIT, THAT ALL OF THAT 
WAS CRUMBLING BEFORE OUR EYES. 
AS HE GUIDED THE STATION 
THROUGH NEGOTIATION, 
ÃºPAINSTAKI 
ITS FIRST YEAR IN FREE ELECTIONS
, AS WE ALL WITNESSED THE GRACE 
AND GENEROSITY WITH WHICH HE 
EMBRACED FORMER ENEMIES. THE 
WISDOM FOR HIM TO STEP AWAY 
FROM POWER ONCE HE FELT HIS JOB 
WAS COMPLETE, WE UNDERSTOOD THAT
--  -- WE UNDERSTOOD
IT WAS NOT JUST THE SUBJUGATED, 
THE OPPRESSED WHO WERE BEING 
FREED FROM THE SHACKLES OF THE 
PAST. 
THE SUBJUGATED WAS BEING 
OFFERED A GIFT. 
BEING GIVEN A CHANCE TO TO SEE 
IN A NEW WAY. BEING GIVEN A 
CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
WORK OF THE BUILDING A BETTER 
WORLD. 
AND DURING THE LAST DECADES OF 
THE LAST CENTURY, THE 
PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATIC VISION 
THAT NELSON MANDELA REPRESENTED 
IN MANY WAYS SET THE TERMS OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL 
DEBATE. IT DOESN'T MEAN THE 
VISION WAS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS, 
BUT IT SET THE TERMS AND 
PARAMETERS AND IT GUIDED HOW WE 
THOUGHT ABOUT THE MEANING OF 
PROGRESS IT CONTINUED TO PROPEL 
THE WORLD FORWARD. 
THERE WERE TRAGEDIES AND BLOOD 
HE CIVIL WARS FROM THE BALKANS 
TO THE CONGO, DESPITE THE FACT 
THAT ETHNIC AND SECTARIAN STRIFE
STILL FLARED UP WITH 
HEARTBREAKING REGULARITY, 
DESPITE THAT, THE DETERMINATION 
OF NUCLEAR TALKS, PEACEFUL AND 
PROSPEROUS JAPAN, UNIFIED 
EUROPE ANCHORED IN NATO, THE 
ENTRY OF CHINA INTO THE WORLD 
SYSTEM OF TRADE, ALL OF THAT 
GREATLY REDUCED THE PROSPECT OF 
WAR BETWEEN THE WORLD'S GREAT 
POWERS. 
FROM EUROPE TO AFRICA, LATIMER, 
SOUTHEAST ASIA -- LATIN AMERICA
, SOUTHEAST ASIA, A RESPECT FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND LAW AND IT WAS 
ENUMERATED IN A DECLARATION BY 
THE UNITED NATIONS, IT BECAME 
THE GUIDING AND NORM FOR THE 
MAJORITY OF NATIONS. 
EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE 
MAJORITY FELT FAR SHORT OF THE 
IDEA. 
EVEN WHEN THE HUMAN RIGHTS WERE 
VIOLATED, THOSE WHO VIOLATED 
HUMAN RIGHTS WERE ON THE 
DEFENSIVE. 
WITH THESE GEOPOLITICAL CHANGES 
CAME SWEEPING ECONOMIC CHANGES. 
THE INTRODUCTION OF MARKET-
BASED PRINCIPLES AND WHICH 
PREVIOUSLY CLOSED ECONOMIES 
ALONG WITH THE FORCES OF GLOBAL 
INTEGRATION POWERED BY NEW 
TECHNOLOGIES SUDDENLY UNLEASHED 
ENTREPRENEURIAL TALENTS TO 
THOSE THAT ONCE HAD BEEN 
RELEGATED TO THE PERIPHERY OF 
THE WORLD ECONOMY WHO HAD 
ENCOUNTERED, SUDDENLY THEY 
COUNTED, SUDDENLY THEY HAD THE 
POSSIBILITIES OF DOING BUSINESS.
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE 
REDUCTION OF ARMED CONFLICTS 
AND SUDDENLY 1 BILLION PEOPLE 
WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY. 
ONCE STARVING NATIONS WERE ABLE 
TO FEED THEMSELVES. 
INFANT MORTALITY RATES PLUMMETED
. AND THE INTERNET MADE IT 
POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO CONNECT 
OVER CULTURES AND CONTINENTS 
AND PEOPLE WERE BROUGHT 
TOGETHER AND POTENTIALLY ALL OF 
THE WORLD'S KNOWLEDGE CAN BE IN 
THE HANDS OF A SMALL CHILD AND 
EVEN THE MOST REMOTE VILLAGE. 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED JUST OVER 
THE COURSE OF A FEW DECADES. 
ALL THAT PROGRESS IS REAL. 
IT HAS BEEN BROAD, AND IT HAS 
BEEN DEEP. 
IT ALL HAPPENED AND WHAT BY THE 
STANDARDS OF HUMAN HISTORY WAS 
NOTHING MORE THAN THE BLINK OF 
AN EYE. 
AND NOW AN ENTIRE GENERATION 
HAS GROWN UP IN A WORLD THAT BY 
MOST MEASURES HAS GOTTEN 
STEADILY MORE FREE AND 
HEALTHIER AND WEALTHIER AND 
LESS VIOLENT AND MORE TOLERANT 
DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR 
LIFETIMES. 
IT SHOULD MAKE US HOPEFUL. BUT 
IF WE CANNOT DENY THE VERY REAL 
STRIDES THAT OUR WORLD IS MADE 
SINCE THE MOMENT WHEN HE TOOK 
THOSE STEPS OUT OF CONFINEMENT, 
WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ALL 
OF THE WAYS THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL ORDER HAS FALLEN 
SHORT OF ITS PROMISE. 
IN FACT IT IS IN PART BECAUSE 
OF THE FAILURES OF GOVERNMENTS 
AND POWERFUL ELITES TO SQUARELY 
ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS AND 
CONTRADICTIONS OF THIS 
INTERNATIONAL THAT WE NOW SEE 
MUCH OF THE WORLD THREATENING 
TO RETURN TO AN OLDER AND MORE 
DANGEROUS OR MORE BRUTAL WAY OF 
DOING BUSINESS. 
WE HAVE TO START BY ADMITTING 
THAT WHATEVER LAWS MAY HAVE 
EXISTED ON THE BOOKS, WHATEVER 
WONDERFUL PRONOUNCEMENTS 
EXISTED IN, WHATEVER WORDS WERE 
SPOKEN DURING THESE LAST SEVERAL
DECADES AT INTERNATIONAL 
CONFERENCES
NEVER COMPLETELY WENT AWAY. 
THEY WERE NEVER FULLY 
DISLODGED. 
 CASTE DIFFERENCES 
STILL IMPACT THE LIVES OF 
PEOPLE IN THE INDIAN 
SUBCONTINENT. 
ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS 
DIFFERENCES STILL DETERMINE WHO 
GETS OPPORTUNITY FROM CENTRAL 
EUROPE TO THE GULF. 
IT IS A PLAIN FACT THAT AIRLINE 
DISCRIMINATION STILL EXISTS -- 
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION STILL 
EXISTS IN BOTH THE UNITED 
STATES AND SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
AND IT IS ALSO A FACT THAT THE 
ACCUMULATED DISADVANTAGES OF 
YEARS OF INSTITUTIONALIZED 
OPPRESSION HAVE CREATED YAWNING 
DISPARITIES AND INCOME AND IN 
WEALTH. 
AND IN EDUCATION. 
AND IN HEALTH, IN PERSONAL 
SAFETY. 
AND ACCESS TO CREDIT. 
WOMEN AND GIRLS AROUND THE 
WORLD CONTINUE TO BE BLOCKED 
FROM POSITIONS OF POWER AND 
AUTHORITY. 
 THEY CONTINUE TO 
-- BE PREVENTED FROM GETTING A 
BASIC EDUCATION. 
THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY 
VICTIMIZED BY VIOLENCE AND 
ABUSE. 
THEY'RE STILL PAID LESS THAN 
MEN FOR DOING THE SAME WORK. 
THAT'S STILL HAPPENING. 
 
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, FOR ALL 
THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE GLOBAL 
ECONOMY, ALL THE SHINING 
SKYSCRAPERS THAT HAVE 
TRANSFORMED THE LANDSCAPE 
AROUND THE WORLD, ENTIRE 
NEIGHBORHOODS, ENTIRE CITIES, 
STIR REGION, ENTIRE NATIONS -- 
ENTIRE REGIONS, ENTIRE NATIONS 
HAVE BEEN BYPASSED. 
IN OTHER WORDS, FOR FAR TOO 
MANY PEOPLE, THE MORE THINGS 
HAVE CHANGED, THE MORE THINGS 
STAY THE SAME. 
 AND WHILE 
GLOBALIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY 
HAVE OPENED UP NEW 
OPPORTUNITIES, HAVE DRIVEN 
REMARKABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, IN 
PREVIOUSLY STRUGGLING PARTS OF 
THE WORLD. 
GLOBALIZATION HAS ALSO UPENDED 
THE AGRICULTURAL AND 
MANUFACTURING SECTORS IN MANY 
COUNTRIES. 
HAS ALSO GREATLY REDUCED THE 
DEMAND FOR CERTAIN WORKERS. 
HAS HELPED WEAKEN UNIONS AND 
LABORERS' BARGAINING POWER. 
IT'S MADE IT EASIER FOR CAPITAL 
TO AVOID TAX LAWS. 
AND THE REGULATIONS OF 
NATION/STATES. 
IT HAS MOVED BILLIONS AND 
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH THE 
TAP OF A COMPUTER KEY. 
AND IT WILL RESULTS OF ALL 
THESE -- THE RESULTS OF ALL 
THESE TRENDS HAS BEEN EXPLOSION 
IN ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. 
IT'S MEANT A FEW DOZEN 
INDIVIDUALS CONTROL THE SAME 
AMOUNT OF WEALTH AS THE POOREST 
HALF OF HUMANITY. 
 
THAT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION, 
THIS IS A STATISTIC. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
IN MANY MIDDLE INCOME AND 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, NEW 
WEALTH HAS JUST TRACKED THE OLD 
BAD DEAL THAT THE PEOPLE GOT. 
BECAUSE IT REINFORCED OR EVEN 
COMPOUNDED EXISTING PATTERNS OF 
INEQUALITY. 
THE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCE IT IS 
CREATED EVEN -- ONLY DIFFERENCE 
IS IT CREATED EVEN GREATER 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORRUPTION ON 
AN EPIC SCALE. 
AND FOR ONE SOLIDLY MIDDLE 
CLASS FAMILY IN ADVANCED 
ECONOMIES LIKE THE UNITED 
STATES, THESE TRENDS HAVE MEANT 
GREATER ECONOMIC INSECURITY. 
SPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T 
HAVE SPECIALIZED SKILLS. 
PEOPLE WHO WERE IN 
MANUFACTURING, PEOPLE WORKING 
IN FACTORIES. 
PEOPLE WORKING ON FARMS. 
IN EVERY COUNTRY JUST ABOUT, 
THE DISPROPORTIONATE ECONOMIC 
CLOUT OF THOSE AT THE TOP HAS 
PROVIDED THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH 
WILDLY DISPROPORTIONATE 
INFLUENCE ON THEIR COUNTRY'S 
POLITICAL LIFE. 
AND ON ITS MEDIA. 
ON WHAT POLICIES ARE PURSUED 
AND WHOSE INTERESTS END UP 
BEING IGNORED. 
NOW, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT 
THIS NEW INTERNATIONAL ELITE, 
THE PROFESSIONAL CLASS THAT 
SUPPORTS THEM, DIFFERS IN 
IMPORTANT RESPECTS FROM THE 
RULING AIR STOCK ARESIES OF 
OLD. 
-- ARISTOCRACIES OF OLD. 
IT INCLUDES MANY THAT ARE SAME 
MADE. 
IT INCLUDES CHAMPIONS OF MERIT 
ROCK ARESY AND ALTHOUGH STILL 
MOSTLY WHITE AND MALE, AS A 
GROUP THEY REFLECT A DIVERSITY 
OF NATIONALITIES AND 
ETHNICITIES THAT WOULD NOT HAVE 
EXISTED 100 YEARS AGO. 
A DECENT PERMITTAGE CONSIDER 
THEMSELVES LIB -- PERCENTAGE 
CONSIDER THEMSELVES LIBERAL IN 
THEIR POLITICS AND MODERN IN 
COSMOPOLITAN IN THEIR OUTLOOK. 
UNBURDENED BY NATIONALISM OR 
PAROCHIALISM. 
OR OVERT RACIAL PREJUDICE OR 
STRONG REASONABLE SENTIMENT. 
-- RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT. 
THEY ARE EQUALLY COMFORTABLE IN 
NEW YORK OR SHANGHAI OR NAIROBI 
OR JOHANNESBURG. 
MANY ARE SINCERE AND EFFECTIVE 
IN THEIR PHILANTHROPY. 
SOME OF THEM COUNT NELSON 
MANDELA AMONG THEIR HEROES. 
SOME EVEN SUPPORTED BARACK 
OBAMA FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
AND BY VIRTUE OF MY STATUS AS A 
FORMER HEAD OF STATE, SOME OF 
THEM CONSIDER ME AS AN HONORARY 
MEMBER OF THE CLUB. 
 
 
AND I GET INVITED TO THESE 
FANCY THINGS YOU KNOW? 
THEY'LL FLY ME OUT. 
BUT WHAT'S NEVERTHELESS TRUE IS 
THAT IN THEIR BUSINESS 
DEALINGS, MANY TITANS OF 
INDUSTRY AND FINANCE ARE 
INCREASINGLY DETACHED FROM ANY 
SINGLE LOCALE OR NATION/STATE. 
THEY LIVE LIVES MORE AND MORE 
INSULATED FROM THE STRUGGLES OF 
ORDINARY PEOPLE IN THEIR 
COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN. 
AND THEIR DECISIONS -- [ 
APPLAUSE ] 
THEIR DECISIONS TO SHUT DOWN A 
MANUFACTURING PLANT OR TO TRY 
TO MINIMIZE THEIR TAX BILL BY 
SHIFTING PROFITS TO THE TAX 
HAVEN WITH THE HELP OF HIGH 
PRICED ACCOUNTANTS OR LAWYERS 
OR THEIR DECISION TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF LOWER COST 
IMMIGRANT LABOR OR THEIR 
DECISION TO PAY A BRIBE. 
ARE OFTEN DONE WITHOUT MALICE, 
IT'S JUST A RATIONAL RESPONSE 
THEY CONSIDER TO SHARE HOLDERS 
AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND 
THE BALANCE SHEET. 
BUT TOO OFTEN THESE DECISIONS 
ARE ALSO MADE WITHOUT REFERENCE 
TO NOTIONS OF HUMAN SOLIDARITY. 
OR A GROUND LEVEL UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL 
BE FELT BY PARTICULAR PEOPLE IN 
PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES BY THE 
DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. 
AND FROM THEIR BOARD ROOMS OR 
RETREATS, GLOBAL DECISION 
MAKERS DON'T GET A CHANCE TO 
SEE SOMETIMES THE PAIN IN THE 
FACES OF LAID OFF WORKERS. 
THEIR KIDS DON'T SUFFER WHEN 
CUTS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND 
HEALTH CARE RESULT AS A 
CONSEQUENCE OF A REDUCED TAX 
BASE BECAUSE OF TAX AVOIDANCE. 
THEY CAN'T HEAR THE RESENTMENT 
OF AN OLDER TRADESMAN WHEN HE 
COMPLAINS THAT A NEWCOMER 
DOESN'T SPEAK HIS LANGUAGE ON A 
JOB SITE WHEN HE WANTS WORK. 
THEY'RE LESS SUBJECT TO THE 
DISCOMFORT AND THE DISPLACEMENT 
THAT SOME OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN 
MAY FEEL AS GLOBALIZATION 
SCRAMBLES NOT ONLY EXISTING 
ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENTS BUT 
TRADITIONAL SOCIAL AND 
RELIGIOUS MORES. 
WHICH IS WHY AT THE END OF THE 
20th CENTURY, WHILE SOME 
WESTERN COMMENTATORS WERE 
DECLARING THE END OF HISTORY 
AND THE INEVITABLE TRIUMPH OF 
LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THE 
VIRTUES OF THE GLOBAL SUPPLY 
CHAIN, SO MANY MISSED SIGNS OF 
A BREWING BACKLASH. 
A BACKLASH THAT ARRIVED IN SO 
MANY FORMS. 
IT ANNOUNCED ITSELF MOST 
VIOLENTLY WITH 9/11. 
AND THE EMERGENCE OF 
TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST 
NETWORKS. 
FUELED BY AN IDEOLOGY THAT 
PERVERTED ONE OF THE WORLD'S 
GREAT RELIGIONS AND ASSERTED A 
STRUGGLE NOT JUST BETWEEN ISLAM 
AND THE WEST BUT BETWEEN ISLAM 
AND MODERNITY. 
AND ILL ADVISED U.S. INVASION 
OF IRAQ DIDN'T HELP. 
 ACCELERATING A 
SECTARIAN CONFLICT. 
RUSSIA ALREADY HUMILIATED BY 
ITS REDUCED INFLUENCE SINCE THE 
COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION, 
FEELING THREATENED BY 
DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS ALONG ITS 
BORDERS, SUDDENLY STARTED 
REASSERTING AUTHORITARIAN 
CONTROL. 
AND IN SOME CASES, MEDDLING 
WITH ITS NEIGHBORS. 
CHINA EMBOLDENED BY ITS 
ECONOMIC SUCCESS, STARTED 
BRISTLING AGAINST CRITICISM OF 
ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. 
IT FRAMED THE PROMOTION OF 
UNIVERSAL VALUES AS NOTHING 
MORE THAN FOREIGN MEDDLING AND 
IMPERIALISM UNDER A NEW NAME. 
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, 
WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
CHALLENGES TO GLOBALIZATION 
FIRST CAME FROM THE LEFT BUT 
THEN CAME MORE FORCEFULLY FROM 
THE RIGHT. 
AS YOU STARTED SEEING POPULIST 
MOVEMENTS WHICH BY THE WAY ARE 
OFTEN CYNICALLY FUNDED BY RIGHT 
WING BILLIONAIRES INTENT ON 
REDUCING GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS 
ON THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS. 
THESE MOVEMENTS TAPPED THE 
UNEASE THAT WAS FELT BY MANY 
PEOPLE WHO LIVED OUTSIDE OF THE 
URBAN COURSE. 
FEARS THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY 
WAS SLIPPING AWAY. 
THAT THEIR SOCIAL STATUS AND 
PRIVILEGES WERE ERODING. 
THAT THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITIES 
WERE BEING THREATENED BY 
OUTSIDERS. 
SOMEBODY THAT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE 
THEM OR SOUND LIKE THEM OR PRAY 
AS THEY DID. 
AND PERHAPS MORE THAN ANYTHING 
ELSE, THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF 
THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS. 
IN WHICH THE RECKLESS BEHAVIOR 
OF FINANCIAL ELITES RESULTED IN 
YEARS OF HARDSHIP FOR ORDINARY 
PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. 
MADE ALL THE PREVIOUS 
ASSURANCES OF EXPERTS RING 
HOLLOW. 
ALL -- ALL THOSE ASSURANCES 
THAT SOMEHOW FINANCIAL 
REGULATORS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE 
DOING. 
THAT SOMEBODY WAS MINDING THE 
STORE. 
THAT GLOBAL ECONOMIC 
INTEGRATION WAS AN UNADULTERED 
GOOD. 
BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY 
GOVERNMENTS DURING AND AFTER 
THAT CRISIS, INCLUDING I SHOULD 
ADD BY AGGRESSIVE STEPS BY MY 
ADMINISTRATION, THE GLOBAL 
ECONOMY IS NOW RETURNED TO 
HEALTHY GROWTH. 
BUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM, THE FAITH 
AND EXPERTS IN PLACES LIKE 
WASHINGTON OR BRUSSELS, ALL 
THAT HAD TAKEN A BLOW. 
AND THE POLITICS OF FEAR AND 
RESENTMENT AND RETRENCHMENT 
BEGAN TO APPEAR. 
AND THAT KIND OF POLITICS IS 
NOW ON THE MOVE. 
IT'S ON A MOVE AT A PACE THAT 
WOULD HAVE SEEMED UNIMAGINABLE 
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. 
I AM NOTING WITH ALARMIST -- 
BEING ALARM ITSELF, I AM -- 
ALARMIST, I AMFULLY STATING THE 
FACTS. 
-- AM SIMPLY STATING THE FACTS. 
LOOK AROUND. 
STRONG MAN POLITICS ARE 
ASCENDANT SUDDENLY. 
WHEREBY ELECTIONS AND SOME 
PRETENSE OF DEMOCRACY ARE 
MAINTAINED THE FORM OF IT. 
BUT THOSE IN POWER SEEK TO 
UNDERMINE EVERY INSTITUTION OR 
NORM THAT GIVES DEMOCRACY 
MEANING. 
 IN THE WEST, 
YOU'VE GOT FAR RIGHT PARTIES 
THAT OFTEN TIMES ARE BASED NOT 
JUST ON PLATFORMS OF 
PROTECTIONISM AND CLOSED 
BORDERS, BUT ALSO ON BARELY 
HIDDEN RACIAL NATIONALISM. 
MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES NOW 
ARE LOOKING AT CHINA'S MODEL OF 
AUTHORITARIAN CONTROL COMBINED 
WITH MERCANTILIST CAPITALISM AS 
PREFERABLE TO THE METHOD OF 
DEMOCRACY. 
WHO NEEDS FREE SPEECH AS LONG 
AS THE ECONOMY IS GOING GOOD? 
THE FREE PRESS IS UNDER ATTACK. 
CENSORSHIP AND STATE CONTROL OF 
MEDIA IS ON THE RISE. 
SOCIAL MEDIA ONCE SEEN AS A 
MECHANISM TO PROMOTE KNOWLEDGE 
AND UNDERSTANDING AND 
SOLIDARITY HAS PROVED TO BE 
JUST AS EFFECTIVE PROMOTING 
HATRED AND PARANOIA AND 
PROPAGANDA AND CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES. 
 SO ON MADIBA'S 
100th BIRTHDAY, WE NOW STAND AT 
A CROSSROADS. 
A MOMENT IN TIME IN WHICH TWO 
VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS OF 
HUMANITY'S FUTURE COMPETE FOR 
THE HEARTS AND THE MINDS OF 
CITIZENS AROUND THE WORLD. 
TWO DIFFERENT STORIES, TWO 
DIFFERENT NARRATIVES. 
ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE 
SHOULD BE. 
HOW SHOULD WE RESPOND? 
SHOULD WE SEE THAT WAVE OF HOPE 
THAT WE FELT WITH MADIBA'S 
RELEASE FROM PRISON, FROM 
BERLIN WALL COMING DOWN. 
SHOULD WE SEE THAT HOPE THAT WE 
HAD AS NAIVE AND MISS GUIDED? 
SHOULD -- MISGUIDED? 
SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND THE LAST 
25 YEARS OF GLOBAL INTEGRATION 
IS NOTHING MORE THAN A DETOUR 
FROM THE PREVIOUS INEVITABLE 
CYCLE OF HISTORY WHERE MIGHT 
MAKES RIGHT AND POLITICS IS A 
HOSTILE COMPETITION BETWEEN 
TRIBES AND RACES AND RELIGIONS 
AND NATIONS COMPETE IN A ZERO 
SUM GAME CONSTANTLY TEETERING 
ON THE EDGE OF CONFLICT UNTIL 
FULL BLOWN WAR BREAKS OUT? 
IS THAT WHAT WE THINK? 
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE. 
I BELIEVE IN NELSON MANDELA'S 
VISION. 
I BELIEVE IN A VISION SHARED BY 
GANDHI AND KING AND ABRAHAM 
LINCOLN. 
I BELIEVE IN A VISION OF 
EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND 
FREEDOM AND MULTIRACIAL 
DEMOCRACY. 
BUILT ON THE PREMISE THAT ALL 
PEOPLE ARE CREATED EQUAL. 
AND THEY'RE ENDOWED BY OUR 
CREATOR WITH CERTAIN 
INALIENABLE RIGHTS AND I 
BELIEVE THAT A WORLD GOVERNED 
BY SUCH PRINCIPLES IS POSSIBLE. 
AND THAT IT CAN ACHIEVE MORE 
PEACE AND MORE COOPERATION IN 
PURSUIT OF A COMMON GOOD. 
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE. 
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE NO CHOICE 
BUT TO MOVE FORWARD. 
THAT THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN 
DEMOCRACY AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND 
A COMMON HUMAN INDUSTRY A 
BETTER STORY -- HUMANITY HAVE A 
BETTER STORY TO TELL. 
AND I BELIEVE THIS NOT JUST 
BASED ON SENTIMENT, I BELIEVE 
IT BASED ON HARD EVIDENCE. 
THE FACT THAT THE WORLD'S MOST 
PROSPEROUS AND SUCCESSFUL 
SOCIETIES, THE ONES WITH  
HIGHESTLYING STANDARDS AND THE 
LIE -- LIVING STANDARDS AND THE 
HIGHEST LEVELS OF SATISFACTION 
AMONG THEIR PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BE 
THOSE WHO HAVE MOST CLOSELY 
APPROXIMATE NATED THE LIBERAL 
-- APPROXIMATED THE LABEL REAL 
IDEAL. 
-- LIBERAL IDEAL. 
THE FACT THAT AUTHORITARIAN 
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN 
TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO BREED 
CORRUPTION, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
TO REPRESS THEIR PEOPLE. 
TO LOSE TOUCH EVENTUALLY WITH 
REALITY. 
TO ENGAGE IN BIGGER AND BIGGER 
LIES THAT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN 
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AND 
CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC 
STAGNATION. 
LOOK AT -- LOOK AT HISTORY. 
LOOK AT THE FACTS. 
THE FACT THAT COUNTRIES WHICH 
RELY ON RABID NATIONALISM AND 
XENOPHOBIA AND DOCTRINES OF 
RELIGIOUS OR RACIAL SUPERIORITY 
AS THAT YOU ARE ORGANIZING 
PRINCIPLE -- THEIR ORGANIZING 
PRINCIPLE. 
EVENTUALLY THOSE COUNTRIES FIND 
THEMSELVES CONSUMED BY CIVIL OR 
EXTERNAL WAR. 
CHECK THE HISTORY BOOKS. 
THE FACT THAT TECHNOLOGY CANNOT 
BE PUT BACK IN A BOTTLE. 
SO WE'RE STUCK WITH THE FACT 
THAT WE NOW LIVE CLOSE 
TOGETHER. 
AND POPULATIONS ARE GOING TO BE 
MOVING. 
AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES 
ARE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY ON 
THEIR OWN. 
SO THAT THE ONLY WAY TO 
EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS PROBLEMS 
LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR MASS 
MIGRATION OR PANDEMIC DISEASE 
WILL BE TO DEVELOP SYSTEMS FOR 
MORE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. 
NOT LESS. 
 WE HAVE A BETTER 
STORY TO TELL. 
BUT TO SAY THAT OUR VISION FOR 
THE FUTURE IS BETTER IS NOT TO 
SAY THAT IT WILL INEVITABLY 
WIN. 
BECAUSE HISTORY ALSO SHOWS THE 
POWER OF FEAR. 
HISTORY SHOWS THE LASTING HOLD 
OF GREED AND THE DESIRE TO 
DOMINATE OTHERS IN THE MINDS OF 
MANY. 
ESPECIALLY MEN. 
  
HISTORY SHOWS HOW EASILY PEOPLE 
CAN BE CONVINCED TO TURN ON 
THSE WHO LOOK DIFFERENT. 
OR WORSHIP GOD IN A DIFFERENT 
WAY. 
SO IF WE'RE TRULY TO CONTINUE 
MADIBA'S LONG WALK TOWARD 
FREEDOM, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
WORK HARDER. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
SMARTER. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN 
FROM THE MISTAKES OF THE RECENT 
PAST. 
AND SO IN THE BRIEF TIME 
REMAINING LET ME JUST SUGGEST A 
FEW GUIDE POSTS FOR THE ROAD 
AHEAD. 
GUIDE POSTS THAT DRAW FROM 
MADIBA'S WORK, HIS WORDS, THE 
LESSONS OF HIS LIFE. 
FIRST MADIBA SHOWS THOSE OF US 
THAT WILL IN FREEDOM AND 
DEMOCRACY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 
TO FIGHT HARDER TO REDUCE 
INEQUALITY AND PROMOTE LASTING 
ECONOMIC EQUALITY FOR ALL 
PEOPLE. 
NOW I DON'T BELIEVE IN 
NICODERMISM. 
-- ECONOMIC DETERMINISM. 
HUMAN BEINGS DON'T LIVE ON 
BREAD ALONE. 
BUT THEY NEED BREAD. 
AND HISTORY SHOWS THAT 
SOCIETIES WHICH TOLERATE VAST 
DIFFERENCES IN WEALTH FEED 
RESENTMENTS AND REDUCE 
SOLIDARITY AND ACTUALLY GROW 
MORE SLOWLY AND THEN ONCE 
PEOPLE ACHIEVED MORE THAN MERE 
SUBSISTENCE, THEY'RE MEASURING 
THEIR WELL-BEING BY HOW THEY 
COMPARE TO CHAIR NEIGHBORS AND 
HOW -- THEIR NEIGHBORS AND HOW 
THEIR CHILDREN CAN EXPECT TO 
LIVE A BETTER LIFE. 
WHEN ECONOMIC POWER IS 
CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF 
THE FEW, HISTORY ALSO SHOWS 
THAT POLITICAL POWER IS SURE TO 
FOLLOW AND THAT THAT DYNAMIC 
EATS AWAY AT DEMOCRACY. 
SOMETIMES IT MAY BE STRAIGHT 
OUT CORRUPTION. 
BUT SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT 
INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF MONEY. 
IT'S JUST FOLKS WHO WERE THAT 
WEALTHY GET WHAT THEY WANT. 
ÃºAN 
FREEDOM. 
AND MADIBA UNDERSTOOD TOO, THIS 
IS NOT NEW, HE WARNED US ABOUT 
THIS. 
HE SAID WHERE GLOBALIZATION 
MEANS AS IT SO OFTEN DOES THAT 
THE RICH AND BE POWERFUL NOW -- 
THE POWERFUL NOW HAVE NEW MEANS 
TO FURTHER ENRICH AND EMPOWER 
THEMSELVES AT THE COST OF THE 
POOR AND THE WEAKER, THEN WE 
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO 
PROTEST IN THE NAME OF 
UNIVERSAL FREEDOM. 
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. 
 
SO IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT 
UNIVERSAL FREEDOM TODAY, IF WE 
CARE ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE 
TODAY, THEN WE HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT. 
AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY AMEND 
WHAT MADIBA SAID. 
I DON'T DO IT OFTEN BUT I WOULD 
SAY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR US 
TO PROTEST, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 
TO BUILD. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
INNOVATE. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE 
OUT HOW DO WE CLOSE THIS 
WIDENING CHASM OF WEALTH AND 
OPPORTUNITY BOTH WITHIN 
COUNTRIES AND BETWEEN THEM? 
 AND -- 
AND HOW WE ACHIEVE THIS IS 
GOING TO VARY. 
COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. 
AND I KNOW YOUR NEW PRESIDENT 
IS COMMITTED TO ROLLING UP HIS 
SLEEVES AND TRYING TO DO 
SOMETHING. 
BUT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE LAST 
70 YEARS THAT IT WILL NOT 
INVOLVE UNREGULATED, UNBRIDLED, 
UNETHICAL CAPITALISM. 
IT ALSO WON'T INVOLVE OLD STYLE 
COMMAND AND CONTROL, SOCIALISM 
FROM THE TOP. 
THAT WAS TRIED IT DIDN'T WORK 
VERY WELL. 
FOR ALMOST ALL COUNTRIES, 
PROGRESS IS GOING TO DEPEND ON 
AN INCLUSIVE MARKET BASED 
SYSTEM. 
ONE THAT OFFERS EDUCATION FOR 
EVERY CHILD. 
THAT PROTECTS COLLECTIVE 
BARGAINING AND SECURES THE 
RIGHTS OF EVERY WORKER. 
THAT BREAKS UP KNOW MOPLIES -- 
UP KNOW NOTARY PUBLICLIES TO -- 
MONOPOLIES TO ENCOURAGE 
COMPETITION IN SMALL AND MEDIUM 
SIZED BUSINESSES AND HAS LAWS 
THAT ROOT OUT CORRUPTION. 
AND ENSURES FAIR DEALING IN 
BUSINESS. 
THAT MAINTAINS SOME FORM OF 
PROGRESSIVE TAXATION. 
SO THAT RICH PEOPLE ARE STILL 
RICH. 
BUT THEY'RE GIVEN A LITTLE BIT 
BACK TO MAKE SURE THAT 
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS SOMETHING. 
TO PAY FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH 
CARE. 
AND RETIREMENT SECURITY. 
AND INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT 
BUILDS PLATFORMS FORREN 
NOVATION. 
I SHOULD -- INNOVATION. 
I SHOULD ADD BY THE WAY RIGHT 
NOW I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED BY 
HOW MUCH MONEY I GOT AND LET ME 
TELL YOU SOMETHING, I DON'T 
HAVE HALF AS MUCH AS MOST OF 
THESE FOLKS OR A TENTH -- 
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN 
EAT. 
THERE'S ONLY SO BIG A HOUSE YOU 
CAN HAVE. 
THERE'S ONLY -- [ CHEERING AND 
APPLAUSE ] THERE'S ONLY SO MANY 
NICE TRIPS YOU CAN TAKE. 
I MEAN, IT'S ENOUGH. 
YET YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A 
VOW OF POVERTY JUST TO SAY. 
WELL LET ME HELP OUT A LITTLE. 
A FEW OF THE OTHER FOLKS, LET 
ME LOOK AT THAT CHILD OUT THERE 
WHO DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT 
OR NEEDS SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL 
FEES, LET -- SCHOOL FEES, LET 
ME PAY A LITTLE MORE IN TAXES. 
IT'S OKAY, I CAN AFFORD IT. 
 I 
MEAN, IT SHOWS A POVERTY OF 
AMBITION TO JUST WANT TO TAKE 
MORE AND MORE AND MORE. 
INSTEAD OF WAYING WOW, I'VE GOT 
-- SAYING WOW, I'VE GOT SO 
MUCH, WHO CAN I HELP AND HOW 
CAN I GIVE MORE AND MORE AND 
MORE? 
 
THAT'S AMBITION. 
THAT'S IMPACT, THAT'S 
INFLUENCE. 
WHAT -- WHAT AN AMAZING GIFT TO 
BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE. 
NOT JUST YOURSELF. 
 
WHERE WAS? 
I AD LIBBED. 
 
YOU GET THE POINT. 
IT INVOLVES PROMOTING AN 
INCLUSIVE CAPITALISM BOTH 
WITHIN NATIONS AND BETWEEN 
NATIONS. 
AND AS WE PURSUE FOR EXAMPLE 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS, 
WE HAVE TO GET PAST THE CHARITY 
MINDSET. 
WE'VE GOT TO BRING MORE 
RESOURCES TO THE FORGOTTEN 
POCKETS OF THE WORLD THROUGH 
INVESTMENT AND 
ENTREPRENEURSHIP. 
BECAUSE THERE IS TALENT 
EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD IF 
GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY. 
 WHEN IT COMES TO 
THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF 
COMMERCE AND TRADE, IT'S 
LEGITIMATE FOR POORER COUNTRIES 
TO CONTINUE TO SEEK ACCESS TO 
WEALTHIER MARKETS AND BY THE 
WAY, WEALTHIER MARKETS, THAT'S 
NOT THE BIG PROBLEM THAT YOU 
ARE HAVING. 
A SMALL AFRICAN COUNTRY IS 
SENDING YOU TEA AND FLOWERS. 
THAT'S NOT YOUR BIGGEST 
ECONOMIC CHALLENGE. 
IT'S ALSO PROPER FOR ADVANCED 
ECONOMIES LIKE THE UNITED 
STATES TO INSIST ON RECIPROCITY 
FROM NATIONS LIKE CHINA THAT 
ARE NO LONGER SOLELY POOR 
COUNTRIES. 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE 
PROVIDING ACCESS TO THEIR 
MARKETS AND THAT THEY STOP 
TAKING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
AND HACKING OUR SERVERS. 
 
BUT -- BUT EVEN AS THERE ARE 
DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD AROUND 
TRADE AND COMMERCE, IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS 
REALITY. 
WHILE THE OUTSOURCING OF JOBS 
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, FROM EAST 
TO WEST, WHILE A LOT OF THAT 
WAS A DOMINANT TREND IN THE 
LATE  20th CENTURY. 
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO 
WORKERS IN COUNTRIES LIKE MINE, 
TODAY IS TECHNOLOGY. 
AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR 
YOUR NEW PRESIDENT WHEN WE 
THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO 
EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE HERE, IS 
GOING TO BE ALSO TECHNOLOGY. 
BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
IS HERE AND IT IS ACCELERATING. 
AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE 
DRIVERLESS CARS AND YOU ARE 
GOING TO HAVE MORE AND MORE 
AUTOMATED SERVICES. 
AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE 
JOB OF GIVING EVERYBODY WORK 
THAT IS MEANINGFUL TOUGHER. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
MORE IMAGINATIVE. 
AND THE PACE OF CHANGE IS GOING 
TO REQUIRE US TO DO MORE 
FUNDAMENTAL REIMAGINING OF OUR 
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL 
ARRANGEMENTS. 
TO PROTECT THE ECONOMIC 
SECURITY AND THE DIGNITY THAT 
COMES WITH A JOB. 
IT'S NOT JUST MONEY THAT A JOB 
PROVIDES. 
IT PROVIDES DIGNITY AND 
STRUCTURE. 
AND A SENSE OF PLACE. 
AND A SENSE OF PURPOSE. 
 
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
CONSIDER NEW WAYS OF THINKING 
ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS LIKE A 
UNIVERSAL INCOME, REVIEW OF OUR 
WORKWEEK, HOW WE RETRAIN OUR 
YOUNG PEOPLE, HOW WE MAKE 
EVERYBODY AN ENTREPRENEUR AT 
SOME LEVEL. 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
WORRY ABOUT ECONOMICS IF WE 
WANT TO GET DEMOCRACY BACK ON 
TRACK. 
SECOND -- MADIBA TEACHES US 
THAT SOME PRINCIPLES REALLY ARE 
UNIVERSAL. 
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS 
THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE ARE BOUND 
TOGETHER BY A COMMON HUMANITY. 
AND THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS 
INHERENT DIGNITY AND WORTH. 
NOW IT'S SURPRISING THAT WE 
HAVE TO AFFIRM THIS TRUTH 
TODAY. 
MORE THAN A QUARTER CENTURY 
AFTER MADIBA WALKED OUT OF 
PRISON, I STILL HAVE TO STAND 
HERE AT A LECTURE AND DEVOTE 
SOME TIME TO SAYING THAT BLACK 
PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE AND 
ASIAN PEOPLE AND LATIN AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND WOMEN AND MEN AND 
GAYS AND STRAIGHTS, THAT WE ARE 
ALL HUMAN. 
THAT OUR DIFFERENCES ARE 
SUPERFICIAL. 
AND THAT WE SHOULD TREAT EACH 
OTHER WITH CARE AND RESPECT. 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WOULD 
HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT BY NOW. 
I THOUGHT THAT BASIC NOTION WAS 
WELL ESTABLISHED. 
 
BUT IT TURNS OUT AS WE'RE 
SEEING IN THIS RECENT DRIFT 
INTO REACTIONARY POLITICS, THAT 
THE STRUGGLE FOR BASIC JUSTICE 
IS NEVER TRULY FINISHED. 
SO WE'VE GOT TO CONSTANTLY BE 
ON THE LOOKOUT AND FIGHT FOR 
PEOPLE WHO SEEK TO ELEVATE 
THEMSELVES BY PUTTING SOMEBODY 
ELSE DOWN. 
AND BY THE WAY, WE ALSO HAVE TO 
ACTIVELY RESIST, THIS IS 
IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN SOME 
COUNTRIES IN AFRICA LIKE MY OWN 
FATHER'S HOMELAND, I HAVE MADE 
THIS POINT BEFORE, WE HAVE TO 
RESIST THE NOTION THAT BASIC 
HUMAN RIGHTS LIKE FREEDOM TO 
DISSENT OR THE RIGHT OF WOMEN 
TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE 
SOCIETY OR THE RIGHTS OF 
MINORITIES TO EQUAL TREATMENT 
OR THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE NOT TO 
BE BEAT UP AND JAILED BECAUSE 
OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. 
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO 
SAY THAT SOMEHOW, WELL, THAT 
DOESN'T APPLY TO US. 
THAT THOSE ARE WESTERN IDEAS. 
RATHER THAN UNIVERSAL 
IMPERATIVES. 
 AGAIN, MADIBA YOU 
KNOW, HE ANTICIPATED THINGS. 
HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT. 
IN 1964, BEFORE HE RECEIVED THE 
SENTENCE THAT CONDEMNED HIM TO 
DIE IN PRISON, HE EXPLAINED 
FROM THE DOCK THAT THE MAGNA 
CARTA, THE PETITION OF RIGHTS, 
THE BILL OF RIGHTS, ARE 
DOCUMENTS WHICH ARE HELD IN 
VENN RATION BY DEMOCRATS 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. 
INSIDE, HE DIDN'T -- IN OTHER 
WORDS, HE DIDN'T SAY WELL, 
THOSE FOLKS WEREN'T WRITTEN BY 
SOUTH AFRICANS AND I GUESS I 
CAN'T CLAIM THEM. 
HE SAYS NO THAT'S PART OF MY 
INHERITANCE. 
THAT'S PART OF THE HUMAN 
INHERITANCE. 
THAT APPLIES HERE IN THE 
COUNTRY. 
TO ME. 
AND TO YOU. 
AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT GAVE 
HIM THE MORAL AUTHORITY THAT 
THE APARTHEID REGIME COULD 
NEVER CLAIM. 
BECAUSE HE WAS MORE FAMILIAR 
WITH THEIR BEST VALUES THAN 
THEY WERE. 
HE HAD READ THEIR DOCUMENTS 
MORE CAREFULLY THAN THEY HAD. 
AND HE WENT ON TO SAY POLITICAL 
DIVISION BASED ON COLOR IS 
ENTIRELY ARTIFICIAL. 
AND WHEN IT DISAPPEARS, SO WILL 
THE DOMINATION OF ONE COLOR 
GROUP BY ANOTHER. 
THAT'S NELSON MANDELA SPEAKING 
IN 1964 WHEN I WAS 3 YEARS OLD. 
 BUT IT WAS TRUE 
THEN AND IT REMAINS TRUE TODAY. 
BASIC TRUTHS DO NOT CHANGE. 
IT IS A TRUTH THAT CAN BE 
EMBRACED BY THE ENGLISH AND BY 
THE INDIAN AND BY THE MEXICAN 
AND BY THE BANTU AND BY THE 
AMERICAN. 
IT IS A TRUTH THAT LIES AT THE 
HEART OF EVERY WORLD RELIGION. 
THAT WE SHOULD DO UNTO OTHERS 
AS WE'D HAVE THEM DO UNTO US. 
THAT WE SEE OURSELVES IN OTHER 
PEOPLE. 
THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE COMMON 
HOPES AND COMMON DREAMS. 
AND IT IS A TRUTH THAT THE IS 
INCOMBAT -- THAT IS 
INCOMPATIBLE WITH ANY FORM OF 
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE OR 
RELIGION OR GENDER OR SEXUAL 
ORIENTATION. 
AND IT A TRUTH THAT BY THE WAY 
WHEN EMBRACED, ACTUALLY 
DELIVERS PRACTICAL BENEFITS. 
SINCE IT ENSURES THAT A SOCIETY 
CAN DRAW UPON THE TALENTS AND 
ENERGY AND SKILL OF ALL ITS 
PEOPLE. 
AND IF YOU DOUBT THAT, JUST ASK 
THE FRENCH FOOTBALL TEAM THAT 
JUST WON THE WORLD CUP. 
 
BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THOSE  FOLKS 
-- NOT ALL OF THOSE FOLKS 
LOOKED LIKE GAULS TO ME. 
BUT THEY'RE FRENCH! 
THEY'RE FRENCH. 
HA. 
NOW EMBRACING OUR COMMON 
HUMANITY DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE 
HAVE TO ABANDON OUR UNIQUE 
ETHNIC AND NATIONAL AND 
RELIGIOUS IDENTITIES. 
BUT MADIBA NEVER STOPPED BEING 
PROUD OF HIS TRIBAL HERITAGE. 
HE DIDN'T -- HE DIDN'T STOP 
BEING PROUD OF BEING A BLACK 
MAN. 
AND BEING A SOUTH AFRICAN. 
BUT HE BELIEVED AS I BELIEVE 
THAT YOU CAN BE PROUD OF YOUR 
HERITAGE WITHOUT DENIGRATING 
THOSE OF A DIFFERENT HERITAGE. 
IN FACT, YOU DISHONOR YOUR 
HERITAGE -- IT WOULD MAKE ME 
THINK THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE 
INSECURE ABOUT YOUR HERITAGE IF 
YOU GOT TO PUT SOMEBODY ELSE'S 
HERITAGE DOWN. 
YEAH. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
 DON'T YOU GET A 
SENSE SOMETIMES -- BUT AGAIN 
I'M AD LIBBING HERE -- THAT 
THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO INTENT 
ON PUTTING PEOPLE DOWN AND 
PROPPING THEMSELVES UP, THAT 
THEY'RE SMALL HEARTED. 
THAT THERE'S -- THERE'S 
SOMETHING THEY'RE JUST AFRAID 
OF. 
MADIBA KNEW THAT WE CANNOT 
CLAIM JUSTICE FOR OURSELVES 
WHEN IT'S ONLY RESERVED FOR 
SOME. 
MADIBA UNDERSTOOD THAT WE CAN'T 
SAY WE'VE GOT A JUST SOCIETY 
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE REPLACED THE 
COLOR OF THE PERSON ON TOP OF 
THE UNJUST SYSTEM SO THE PERSON 
LOOKS LIKE US. 
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE DOING THE 
SAME STUFF AND SOMEHOW NOW 
WE'VE GOT JUSTICE. 
THAT DOESN'T WORK. 
 
IT'S NOT JUSTICE IF NOW YOU ARE 
ON TOP AND SO I'M GOING TO DO 
THE SAME THING THAT THOSE FOLKS 
WERE DOING TO ME. 
NOW I'M GOING TO DO IT TO YOU. 
THAT'S NOT JUSTICE. 
I DETEST RACIALISM HE SAID, 
WHETHER IT COMES FROM A BLACK 
MAN OR A WHITE MAN. 
NOW WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
THERE'S DISORIENTATION THAT 
COMES FROM RAPID CHANGE IN 
MODERNIZATION AND THE FACT THAT 
THE WORLD HAS SHRUNK AND WE'RE 
GOING TO HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO 
LESSEN THE FEARS OF THOSE WHO 
FEEL THREATENED. 
IN THE WEST CURRENT DEBATE 
AROUND IMMIGRATION FOR EXAMPLE. 
IT'S NOT WRONG TO INSIST THAT 
NATIONAL BORDERS MATTER. 
THAT YOU KNOW, WHETHER YOU'RE A 
CITIZEN OR NOT IS GOING TO 
MATTER TO A GOVERNMENT. 
THAT LAWS NEED TO BE FOLLOWED. 
THAT IN THE PUBLIC REALM, 
NEWCOMERS SHOULD MAKE AN EFFORT 
TO ADAPT TO THE LANGUAGE AND 
CUSTOMS OF THEIR NEW HOME. 
THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE CHANGES. 
AND -- THINGS. 
AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO 
ENGAGE PEOPLE WHO DO FEEL AS IF 
THINGS ARE NOT ORDERLY. 
BUT THAT CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR 
IMMIGRATION POLICIES BASED ON 
RACE. 
OR ETHNICITY OR RELIGION. 
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME 
CONSISTENCY. 
AND WE CAN ENFORCE THE LAW 
WHILE RESPECTING THE ESSENTIAL 
HUMANITY OF THOSE WHO ARE 
STRIVING FOR A BETTER LIFE. 
FOR A MOTHER WITH A CHILD IN 
HER ARMS, WE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT 
COULD BE SOMEBODY IN OUR 
FAMILY. 
THAT COULD BE MY CHILD. 
THIRD, MADIBA REMINDS US THAT 
DEMOCRACY IS MORE THAN JUST 
ABOUT ELECTIONS. 
WHEN HE WAS FREED FROM PRISON, 
YOU KNOW HIS POPULARITY -- WELL 
YOU COULDN'T EVEN MEASURE IT. 
HE COULD HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT 
FOR LIFE. 
AM I WRONG? 
WHO WAS GOING TO RUN AGAINST 
HIM? I 
MEAN -- AMONG HIS FOLKS HE WAS 
POPULAR BUT COME ON. 
PLUS HE WAS A -- HE WAS TOO 
YOUNG. 
HAD HE CHOSE, MADIBA COULD HAVE 
GOVERNED BY EXECUTIVE FIAT. 
UNCONSTRAINED BY CHECKS AND 
BALANCES. 
BUT INSTEAD, HE HELPED GUIDE 
SOUTH AFRICA THROUGH THE 
DRAFTING OF A NEW CONSTITUTION. 
DRAWING FROM ALL THE 
INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES AND 
DEMOCRATIC IDEALS THAT HAD 
PROVEN TO BE MOST STURDY. 
MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NO 
SINGLE INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES A 
MONOPOLY ON WISDOM. 
NO INDIVIDUAL, NOT MANDELA, NOT 
OBAMA, OR AN ENTIRELY IMMUNE -- 
ARE ENTIRELY IMMUNE TO THE 
CORRUPTING INFLUENCES OF 
ABSOLUTE POWER IF YOU CAN DO 
WHATEVER YOU WANT. 
AND EVERYONE'S TOO AFRAID TO 
TELL YOU WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A 
MISTAKE. 
NO ONE IS IMMUNE FROM THE 
DANGERS OF THAT. 
MANDELA UNDERSTOOD THIS. 
HE SAYS DEMOCRACY IS BASED ON 
THE MAJORITY PRINCIPLE. 
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN A 
COUNTRY SUCH AS OURS WHERE THE 
VAST MAJORITY HAVE BEEN 
SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED THEIR 
RIGHTS. 
AT THE SAME TIME DEMOCRACY ALSO 
REQUIRES THE RIGHTS OF 
POLITICAL AND OTHER MINORITIES 
BE SAFEGUARDED. 
HE UNDERSTOOD IT'S NOT JUST 
ABOUT WHO HAS THE MOST VOTES. 
IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE CIVIC 
CULTURE THAT WE BUILD THAT 
MAKES DEMOCRACY WORK. 
SO WE HAVE TO STOP PRETENDING 
THAT COUNTRIES THAT JUST HOLD 
AN ELECTION WHERE SOMETIMES THE 
WINNER SOMEHOW MAGICALLY GETS 
930% OF THE VOTE -- # 0% OF THE 
-- 90% OF THE VOTE BECAUSE ALL 
THE OPPOSITION THE LOCKED UP. 
OR CAN'T GET ON -- IS LOCKED 
UP. 
OR CAN'T GET ON TV IS. 
A DEMOCRACY -- TV. 
IS A DEMOCRACY. 
DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON STRONG 
INSTITUTIONS. 
AND IT'S ABOUT MINORITY RIGHTS. 
AND CHECKS AND BALANCES. 
AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND 
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND A 
FREE PRESS. 
AND THE RIGHT TO PROTEST AND 
PETITION THE GOVERNMENT. 
AND AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY 
AND EVERYBODY HAVING TO FOLLOW 
THE LAW. 
 
AND YES, DEMOCRACY CAN BE 
MESSY. 
AND IT CAN BE SLOW AND IT CAN 
BE FRUSTRATING. 
I KNOW. 
I PROMISE. 
 
BUT THE EFFICIENCY THAT'S 
OFFERED BY AN AUTOCRAT, THAT'S 
A FALSE PROMISE. 
DON'T TAKE THAT ONE. 
BECAUSE IT LEADS INVARIABLY TO 
MORE CONSOLIDATION OF WEALTH 
AND POWER AT THE TOP. 
AND IT MAKES IT EASIER TO 
CONCEAL CORRUPTION AND ABUSE. 
FOR ALL ITS IMPERFECTIONS, REAL 
DEMOCRACY BEST UPHOLDS THE IDEA 
THAT GOVERNMENT EXISTS TO SERVE 
THE INDIVIDUAL. 
AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. 
 
AND IT IS THE ONLY FORM OF 
GOVERNMENT THAT HAS THE 
POSSIBILITY OF MAKING THAT IDEA 
REAL. 
SO FORTHOSE OF US WHO ARE 
INTERESTED IN STRENGTHENING 
DEMOCRACY, IT'S TIME FOR US TO 
STOP PAYING ALL OF OUR 
ATTENTION TO THE WORLD'S 
CAPITALS AND THE CENTERS OF 
POWER AND TO START FOCUSING 
MORE ON THE GRASSROOTS. 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE DEMOCRATIC 
LEGITIMACY COMES FROM. 
NOT FROM THE TOP DOWN. 
NOT FROM ABSTRACT THEORIES, NOT 
JUST FROM EXPERTS, BUT FROM THE 
BOTTOM UP. 
KNOWING THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO 
ARE STRUGGLING AS A COMMUNITY 
ORGANIZER I LEARNED AS MUCH 
FROM A LAID OFF STEEL WORKER IN 
CHICAGO OR A SINGLE MOM IN A 
POOR NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I 
VISITED AS I HAVE LEARNED FROM 
THE FINEST ECONOMISTS IN THE 
OVAL OFFICE. 
DEMOCRACY MEANS BEING IN TOUCH 
AND IN TUNE WITH LIFE AS IT'S 
LIVED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD 
EXPECT FROM OUR LEADERS. 
AND IT DEPENDS UPON CULTIVATING 
LEAD AT THE GRASSROOTS -- 
LEADERS AT THE GRASSROOTS. 
WHO CAN HELP BRING ABOUT CHANGE 
AND IMPLEMENT IT ON THE GROUND 
AND CAN TELL LEADERS IN FANCY 
BUILDINGS, THIS ISN'T WORKING 
DOWN HERE. 
AND TO MAKE DEMOCRACY WORK, 
MADIBA SHOWS US THAT WE ALSO 
HAVE TO KEEP TEACHING OUR 
CHILDREN AND OURSELVES AND THIS 
IS REALLY HARD, TO ENGAGE WITH 
PEOPLE NOT ONLY WHO LOOK 
DIFFERENT, BUT WHO HOLD 
DIFFERENT VIEWS. 
THIS IS HARD. 
 
MOST OF US PREFER TO SURROUND 
OURSELVES WITH OPINIONS THAT 
VALIDATE WHAT WE ALREADY 
BELIEVE. 
YOU NOTICE THE PEOPLE WHO YOU 
THINK ARE SMART ARE THE PEOPLE 
WHO AGREE WITH YOU. 
 
FUNNY HOW THAT WORKS. 
BUT DEMOCRACY DEMANDS THAT 
WE'RE ABLE ALSO TO GET INSIDE 
THE REALITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
DIFFERENT THAN US. 
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR 
POINT OF VIEW. 
MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THEIR MINDS 
BUT MAYBE THEY'LL CHANGE OURS. 
AND YOU CAN'T DO THIS IF YOU 
JUST OUT OF HAND DISREGARD WHAT 
YOUR POINTS HAVE TO SAY -- 
OPPONENTS THERE SO SAY FROM THE 
-- HAVE TO SAY FROM THE START 
AND YOU CAN'T DO IT IF YOU 
INSIST THAT THOSE THAT AREN'T 
LIKE YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE WHITE 
OR MALE. 
THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M FEELING. 
THAT SOMEHOW THEY LACK STANDING 
TO SPEAK ON CERTAIN MATTERS. 
MADIBA, HE LIVED THIS 
COMPLEXITY. 
IN PRISON, HE STUDIED AFRIK AS 
SO HE COULD -- AFRIKAANS TO HE 
COULD UNDERSTAND. 
HE KNEW THEY HAD TO BE A PART 
OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOUTH AFRICA 
THAT HE WANTED TO BUILD. 
TO MAKE PEACE WITH AN ENEMY HE 
WROTE, ONE MUST WORK WITH THAT 
ENEMY. 
AND THAT ENEMY BECOMES ONE'S 
PARTNER. 
SO THOSE WHO TRAFFIC IN 
ABSOLUTES WHEN IT COMES TO 
POLICY, WHETHER IT'S ON THE 
LEFT OR THE RIGHT, THEY MAKE 
DEMOCRACY UNWORKABLE. 
YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO GET 100% OF 
WHAT YOU WANT ALL THE TIME. 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO 
COMPROMISE. 
IT DOESN'T MEAN ABANDONING YOUR 
PRINCIPLES BUT INSTEAD, IT 
MEANS HOLDING ON TO THOSE 
PRINCIPLES AND THEN HAVING THE 
CONFIDENCE THEY'RE GOING TO 
STAND UP TO A SERIOUS 
DEMOCRATIC DEBATE. 
THAT'S HOW AMERICA'S FOUNDERS 
INTENDED OUR SYSTEM TO WORK. 
THROUGH THE TESTING OF IDEAS 
AND THE APPLICATION OF REASON 
AND PROOF. 
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ARRIVE 
AT A BASIS FOR COMMON GROUND. 
AND I SHOULD ADD FOR THIS TO 
WORK, WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY 
BELIEVE IN AN OBJECTIVE 
REALITY. 
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE 
THINGS THAT I DIDN'T THINK I 
HAD TO LECTURE ABOUT. 
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN FACTS. 
 
WITHOUT FACTS, THERE'S NO BASIS 
FOR COOPERATION. 
IF I SAY THIS IS A PODIUM AND 
YOU SAY THIS IS AN ELEPHANT, 
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR US TO 
COOPERATE. 
I CAN FIND COMMON GROUND FOR 
THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE PARIS 
ACCORDS. 
BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE, THEY MIGHT 
SAY WELL, IT'S NOT GOING TO 
WORK. 
YOU CAN'T GET EVERYBODY TO 
COOPERATE. 
OR THEY MIGHT SAY, IT'S MORE 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO PROVIDE 
CHEAP ENERGY FOR THE POOR. 
EVEN IF IT MEANS IN THE SHORT-
TERM THAT THERE'S MORE 
POLLUTION. 
AT LEAST I CAN HAVE A DEBATE 
WITH THEM ABOUT THAT AND I CAN 
SHOW THEM WHY I THINK CLEAN 
ENERGY IS THE BETTER PATH 
ESPECIALLY FOR POOR TON 
COUNTRIES THAT YOU CAN -- 
COUNTRIES THAT YOU CAN LEAPFROG 
OLD TECHNOLOGIES. 
I CAN'T FIND COMMON GROUND IF 
SOMEBODY SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE IS 
JUST NOT HAPPENING. 
WHEN ALMOST ALL THE WORLD'S 
SCIENTISTS TELL US IT IS. 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START 
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS. 
IF YOU START SAYING IT'S AN 
ELABORATE HOAX, I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT TO -- WHERE DO WE START? 
UNFORTUNATELY, TOO MUCH OF 
POLITICS TODAY SEEMS TO REJECT 
THE VERY CONCEPT OF OBJECTIVE 
TRUTH. 
PEOPLE JUST MAKE STUFF UP. 
THEY JUST MAKE STUFF UP. 
WE SEE IT IN THE GROWTH OF 
STATE SPONSORED PROPAGANDA. 
WE SEE IT IN INTERNET DRIVEN 
FABRICATIONS. 
WE SEE IT IN THE BLURRING OF 
LINES BETWEEN NEWS AND 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
WE SEE THE UTTER LOSS OF SHAME 
AMONG POLITICAL LEADERS, WHERE 
THEY'RE CAUGHT IN A LIE AND 
THEY JUST DOUBLE DOWN AND THEY 
LIE SOME MORE. 
IT USED -- LOOK. 
LET ME SAY. 
POLITICS HAVE ALWAYS -- 
POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS LIED 
BUT IT USED TO BE IF AUGITES 
THEM LYING, THEY'D BE LIKE -- 
IF YOU CAUGHT THEM LYING. 
THEY'D BE LIKE OH MAN. 
 
NOW THEY JUST KEEP ON LYING. 
THEY JUST --  I 
MEAN, THIS IS -- BY THE WAY, 
THIS IS WHAT I THINK HE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF MAYBE 
SOME SENSE OF HUMILITY THAT 
MADIBA FELT. 
LIKE SOMETIMES JUST BASIC 
STUFF. 
ME JUST NOT COMPLETELY LYING TO 
PEOPLE. 
I THINK IS PRETTY BASIC. 
I DIDN'T -- I DON'T KNOW -- I 
DON'T THINK MYSELF GREAT LEADER 
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T COMPLETELY 
MAKE STUFF UP. 
I MEAN, YOU -- YOU THINK THAT 
WAS KIND OF JUST A BASELINE. 
ANYWAY. 
WE SEE IT IN THE PROMOTION OF 
ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM. 
AND THE REJECTION OF SCIENCE. 
FROM LEADERS WHO FIND CRITICAL 
THINKING AND ANALYSIS AND DATA 
SOMEHOW POLITICALLY 
INCONVENIENT. 
AND AS WITH DENIAL OF RIGHTS, 
THE DENIAL OF FACTS RUNS 
COUNTER TO DEMOCRACY. 
IT COULD BE ITS UNDOING. 
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO 
ZEALOUSLY PROTECT INDEPENDENT 
MEDIA. 
AND WE HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST 
THE TENDENCY FOR SOCIAL MEDIA 
TO BECOME A PURELY A PLATFORM 
FOR SPECTACLE AND OUTRAGE AND 
DISINFORMATION. 
AND WE HAVE TO INSIST THAT OUR 
SCHOOLS TEACH CRITICAL THINKING 
TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. 
NOT JUST BLIND OBEDIENCE.
WHICH I'M SURE YOU ARE THANKFUL 
FOR LEADS ME TO MY FINAL POINT. 
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW MADIBA'S 
EXAMPLE OF PERSISTENCE AND OF 
HOPE. 
IT'S TEMPTING RIGHT NOW TO GIVE 
INTO CYNICISM. 
TO BELIEVE THAT REÂ¢ SHIFTS IN 
GLOBAL -- RECENT SHIFTS IN 
GLOBAL POLITICS ARE TOO 
POWERFUL TO PUSH BACK. 
THAT THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG 
PERMANENTLY. 
AND JUST AS PEOPLE SPOKE ABOUT 
THE TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY, IN 
THE '90s, NOW YOU ARE HEARING 
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE END OF 
DEMOCRACY. 
AND THE TRIUMPH OF TRIBALISM 
AND THE STRONG MAN. 
WE HAVE TO RESIST THAT 
CYNICISM. 
BECAUSE -- BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN 
THROUGH DARKER TIMES. 
WE'VE BEEN IN LOWER VALLEYS. 
YES, BY THE END OF THIS LIFE, 
MADIBA EMBODIED THE SUCCESSFUL 
STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. 
BUT THAT JOURNEY WAS NOT EASY. 
IT WASN'T PREORDAINED. 
THE MAN WENT TO PRISON FOR 
ALMOST THREE DECADES. 
HE SPLIT LIMESTONE IN THE HEAT. 
AND HE SLEPT IN A SMALL CELL. 
AND WAS REPEATEDLY PUT IN 
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. 
AND I REMEMBER TALKING TO SOME 
OF HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES, 
SAYING HOW THEY HADN'T REALIZED 
WHEN THEY WERE AT LEAST JUST 
THE SIGHT OF A CHILD, THE IDEA 
OF HOLDING A CHILD, THEY HAD 
MISSED. 
THEY -- IT WASN'T SOMETHING 
AVAILABLE TO THEM. 
FOR DECADES. 
AND YET SOMEHOW HIS POWER 
ACTUALLY GREW. 
DURING THOSE YEARS. 
AND THE POWER OF HIS JAILERS 
DIMINISHED BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT 
IF YOU STICK TO WHAT'S TRUE, IF 
YOU -- IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN 
YOUR HEART AND YOU'RE WILLING 
TO SACRIFICE FOR IT. 
EVEN IN THE FACE OF 
OVERWHELMING ODDS, THAT IT 
MIGHT NOT HAPPEN TOMORROW. 
IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN NEXT WEEK. 
IT MIGHT NOT EVEN HAPPEN IN 
YOUR LIFETIME. 
THINGS MAY GO BACKWARDS FOR A 
WHILE. 
BUT ULTIMATELY, RIGHT MAKES 
MIGHT. 
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. 
ULTIMATELY THE BETTER STORY CAN 
WIN OUT. 
AND AS STRONG AS MADIBA'S 
SPIRIT MAY HAVE BEEN, HE WOULD 
NOT HAVE SUSTAINED THAT HOPE 
HAD HE BEEN ALONE IN THE 
STRUGGLE. 
PART OF WHAT BUOYED HIM UP WAS 
THAT EACH YEAR HE KNEW THE 
RANKS OF FREEDOM FIGHTERS WERE 
REPLENISHING. 
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN SOUTH 
AFRICA BUT ALSO BLACK AND WHITE 
AND INDIAN FROM ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY SIDE, ACROSS THE 
CONTINENT. 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
WHO IN THOSE MOST DIFFICULT 
DAYS, WOULD KEEP WORKING ON 
BEHALF OF HIS VISION. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED RIGHT 
NOW. 
WE DON'T JUST NEED ONE LEADER. 
WE DON'T JUST NEED ONE 
INSPIRATION, WHAT WE BADLY 
RIGHT NOW IS THAT COLLECTIVE 
SPIRIT. 
AND I KNOW THAT THOSE YOUNG 
PEOPLE, THOSE HOPE CARRIER, 
ARE GATHERING AROUND THE WORLD. 
BECAUSE HISTORY SHOWS THAT 
WHENEVER PROGRESS IS 
THREATENED, AND THE THINGS WE 
CARE ABOUT MOST ARE IN 
QUESTION, WE SHOULD HEED THE 
WORDS OF ROBERT KENNEDY WHO 
SPOKE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. 
HE SAID OUR ANSWER IS THE 
WORLD'S HOPE. 
IT IS TO RELY ON YOUTH. 
IT'S TO RELY ON THE SPIRIT OF 
THE YOUNG. 
SO YOUNG PEOPLE, WHO ARE IN THE 
AUDIENCE, WHO ARE LISTENING -- 
 
MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS SIMPLE -- 
KEEP BELIEVING. 
KEEP MARCHING. 
KEEP BUILDING. 
KEEP RAISING YOUR VOICE. 
EVERY GENERATION HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO REMAKE THE 
WORLD. 
AND MANDELA SAID YOUNG PEOPLE 
ARE CAPABLE WHEN AROUSED OF 
BRINGING DOWN THE TOWERS OF 
OPPRESSION AND RAISING THE 
BANNERS OF FREEDOM. 
NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO BE 
AROUSED. 
 
NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO BE FIRED 
UP. 
AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO CARE 
ABOUT THE LEGACY THAT WE HONOR 
HERE TODAY, ABOUT EQUALITY AND 
DIGNITY, AND DEMOCRACY, AND 
SOLIDARITY, AND KINDNESS, THOSE 
OF US WHO REMAIN YOUNG AT HEART 
IF NOT IN BODY, WE HAVE AN 
OBLIGATION TO HELP OUR YOUTH 
SUCCEED. 
SOME OF YOU KNOW HERE IN SOUTH 
AFRICA, MY FOUNDATION HAS BEEN 
CONVENING OVER THE LAST FEW 
DAYS, 200 YOUNG PEOPLE FROM 
ACROSS THIS CONTINENT WHO ARE 
DOING THE HARD WORK OF MAKING 
CHANGE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. 
WHO REFLECT MADIBA'S VALUES. 
WHO ARE POISED TO LEAD THE WAY. 
 
PEOPLE LIKE ABASS MFINDI WHO 
FOUNDED IF MEDIA CHALLENGE TO 
HELP WHERE T YOUNG PEOPLE GET 
-- GET THE YOUNG PEOPLE THE 
HELP THEY NEED. 
ENTREPRENEUR FROM KENYA AND 
FOUNDED THE MERGING LEADERS 
FOUNDATION TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE 
INVOLVED IN THE WORK OF 
FIGHTING POVERTY AND PROMOTING 
HUMAN DIGNITY. 
PEOPLE LIKE ENOCH MALANGA WHO 
DIRECTS THE AFRICAN CHILDREN'S 
MISSION WHICH HELPS CHILDREN IN 
UGANDA AND KENYA GET THE RIGHTS 
CHILDREN, AND YOU MEET THESE 
PEOPLE, YOU TALK TO THEM, THEY 
WILL GIVE YOU HOPE. 
THEY ARE TAKING THE BATON. 
THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T JUST REST 
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE 
PAST. 
EVEN THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 
THOSE AS MOMENTOUS AS NELSON 
MANDELA'S. 
THEY STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE THEM. 
INCLUDING THAT YOUNG BLACK BOY 
BORN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. 
BUT THEY KNOW THAT IT IS NOW 
THEIR TURN TO DO THE WORK. 
MADIBA REMINDS US THAT NO ONE 
IS BORN HATING ANOTHER PERSON 
ECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR 
SKIN OR HIS BACKGROUND OR HIS 
RELIGION. 
PEOPLE MUST LEARN TO HATE, AND 
IF THEY CAN LEARN TO HATE, THEY 
CAN BE TAUGHT TO LOVE. 
FOR LOVE COMES MORE NATURALLY 
TO THE HUMAN HEART, LOVE COMES 
MORE NATURALLY TO THE HUMAN 
HEART, LET'S REMEMBER THAT 
TRUTH. 
LET'S SEE IT AS OUR NORTH STAR. 
LET'S BE JOYFUL IN OUR STRUGGLE 
TO MAKE THAT TRUTH MANIFEST 
HERE ON EARTH SO THAT A HUNDRED 
YEARS FROM NOW, FUTURE 
GENERATIONS WILL LOOK BACK AND 
SAY THEY KEPT THE MARCH GOING. 
THAT'S WHY WE LIVE UNDER NEW 
BANNERS OF FREEDOM. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOUTH 
AFRICA. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA 
GIVE THE KEYNOTE SPEECH AT THE 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF NELSON 
MANDELA'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION 
IN SOUTH AFRICA, A PACKED ARENA 
HERE AND THERE WAS A LOT OF 
SPECULATION, VLAD, ABOUT 
WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD COMMENT 
ON THE CURRENT POLITICAL STATE, 
PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE U.S., 
AND I THINK WE HEARD PERHAPS, 
ONE COULD ARGUE, SOME VEILED 
REFERENCES. 
>> YEAH, THE FORMER PRESIDENT 
IS ALWAYS VERY ELOQUENT IN 
THESE SPEECHES THAT HE DELIVERS 
AND HE DIDN'T OBVIOUSLY WANT TO 
CALL OUT ANOTHER PRESIDENT OR 
ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION WHILE 
HE'S TRAVELING, BUT HE DID SAY 
THIS, HE ENDED IN CELEBRATING 
NELSON MANDELA'S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
USING THE WORDS OF MADIBA, THE 
FAMILY NAME OF NELSON MANDELA 
IN HIS NATIVE TONGUE IN SOUTH 
AFRICA, BY SAYING THAT IF YOU 
CAN BE TAUGHT HATE, YOU CAN 
ALSO BE TAUGHT TO LOVE, AND THE 
PRESIDENT DID SAY THIS, IF WE 
CANNOT DENY THE STRIDES OR 
WORLD HAS MADE, SURE THE 
MOMENTS MADIBA TOOK STEPS OUT 
OF CONFINEMENT, WE HAVE TO 
RECOGNIZE ALL THE WAYS THE 
INTERNATIONAL ORDER HAS FALLEN 
SHORT OF ITS PROMISE, AND THE 
PRESIDENT SORT OF TALKING ABOUT 
SOCIAL MEDIA AND SAYING HOW 
IT'S BECOME A CESSPOOL OF 
PARANOIA AND CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES, DID GO ON TO SAY, I 
BELIEVE IN NELSON MANDELA'S 
VISION, I BELIEVE IN A VISION 
SHARED BY GANDHI, KING, AND 
ABRAHAM LINCOLN, I BELIEVE IN A 
VISION OF EQUALITY, JUSTICE AND 
FREEDOM, AND A MULTIRACIAL 
DEMOCRACY. 
NELSON MANDELA BORN 100 YEARS 
THIS YEAR. 
IT'S A HUGE CELEBRATION YOU CAN 
SEE IN SOUTH AFRICA. 
FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE IN THAT 
COUNTRY, WHEN MANDELA WAS 
RELEASED FROM CONFINEMENT, 
RELEASED FROM PRISON, THEY 
WEREN'T SURE THE DIRECTION OF 
THE COUNTRY WAS GOING TO GO. 
THIS IS A MAN WHO HAD BEEN 
IMPRISONED FOR SO MANY YEARS 
AND PERHAPS A LOT OF PEOPLE, 
THE WHITE MINORITY THOUGHT HE 
WOULD COME BACK AND EXACT 
RETRIBUTION, AND IN FACT, WHAT 
HE DID IS BRING THE COUNTRY 
TOGETHER. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK, AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE 
A LOOK AT WHAT PAUL RYAN HAD TO 
SAY IN THE WAKE OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S HELSINKI PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
WE'LL HAVE THAT AFTER THE BREAK 
FOR YOU, STICK AROUND. 
THIS IS CBSN.
