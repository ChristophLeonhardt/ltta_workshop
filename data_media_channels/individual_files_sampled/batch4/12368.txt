so the Grammys got destroyed in the ratings 33% down on last year which already was performing pretty dismal e among the key 18 to 49 demographic it was awful I watched it I'm I am the guy who watched it or at least some of it which was just saying something I believe I constituted a full 50% of the Grammys audience from last night and I only watched parts of it because both drew for his show and Fox and Friends first made me covered it if one of them had asked I would have refused because life is too short but both of them asked so I watched it it was horrific but it did bring to mind some curious thoughts on the culture first last night's Grammys proof Aristotle right we will explain more on that later and Patti lupone's performance showed that our musical culture really has decayed it's not just nostalgia it's not just sentimentalism our popular music really is a worse now so to begin let's really get started I'll put my keeps down here to begin whatever it is that Kendrick Lamar does should be illegal as I'm kidding maybe Ms ort of getting it is not just awful music and not great culture and it's it's ironic actually that I'm talking about Kendrick Lamar because I actually kind of liked the idea of Kendrick Lamar for the culture he's probably a positive force he's apparently a devoted Christian he doesn't do drugs he's monogamous he's engaged to his longtime girlfriend he credits all of his success to God he said quote I got a greater purpose God put something in my heart to get across and that's what I'm going to focus on using my voice as an instrument and doing what needs to be done he made his way out of Compton no easy task he doesn't shoot or stab people which puts him leagues ahead of other famous hip-hop people like snoop diggity Doo Dada and jay-z he did vote for Barack Obama in 2012 because he said MIT Romney doesn't have a good heart I don't like that very much that's that's neither charitable nor true but all in all the idea of this guy is pretty good and he is among the best that the music industry in 2018 has to offer but his music is terrible it's just awful but for some people this is their primary exposure to art this is what they think art is that is a tragedy for our culture
