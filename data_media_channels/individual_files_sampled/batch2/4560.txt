we're talking immigration on a morning when I'll tell you what the president is not tweeting about President Trump is quiet as a mouse on the subject of immigration Shh not a word after his wife first lady Melania Trump sperits his in-laws became American citizens yesterday a joyous occasion in a private ceremony their daughter missed the occasion here's my question how exactly did the nows family get so lucky they have travailed a wonderful journey like most have millions have in getting citizenship and waiting the requisite period of time the application the process the interview was no different than anybody else's maybe there is something the analysis lawyer did not acknowledge something he did not acknowledge until he was directly asked milania's parents came through the system known as family reunification a u.s. immigration policy that their son-in-law the President of the United States likes to aggressively call chain migration a system he absolutely loves to hate chain migration is one of the disasters Jain migration is a disaster disaster a total disaster we have to end chain migration we have to end my grades not an exaggeration the president he likes the term chain migration almost as much as he likes the words no collusion but what exactly does it mean well actually chain migration is officially as I mentioned called family reunification under federal law and it is the process in which legal US residents can bring family members over from other countries it is the most common kind of immigration by a mile between sixty and seventy percent of all legal immigrants in the last ten years came with family ties so here's how it works green card holders can petition for a spouse or unmarried children to immigrate u.s. citizens can petition for all of their kids married or not a spouse parents and siblings - but no one can petition for an aunt uncle cousin needs nephew or grandparent of course that did not stop the president from saying this at his State of the Union address back in January a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives that's the president in the State of the Union lying to us and PS just because you petition for family members there are absolutely no guarantees and waiting periods can last anywhere from a few months to decades there are really only two ways you are guaranteed citizenship if you're born in the United States if you are born elsewhere and at least one parent is an American citizen beyond that all foreigners have to go through a naturalization process you've got to be 18 years old have lived here legally for at least five years can read write and speak basic English know the fundamentals of US government and have a good moral character hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
