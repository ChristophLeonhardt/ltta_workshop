I want to bring in Tom winter who's also on this story here for us at NBC News Tom we just got a note from the investigative team they went over to the Regency Hotel where Michael Cohen has been staying I believe because of a water pipe burst in his home and the doorman said that the FBI is still there they called up to Michael Cohen's room and a woman answered said it was Michael cones wife when asked if the FBI was still in the room the woman hung up so we have the Regency where Michael Cohen is staying we're also led to believe that they could have raided his actual home where that work is being done and then they came here to 30 rock where his law office is he's been partnering with the law office and working out of here moved everything from his Trump Tower location we presume we also went to Trump Tower and as we know right now the FBI did not go there and they could be pretty complicated to go there at the moment sure what were they looking for what did they find what do we know right now so Katie based on the reporting of myself my colleagues Jonathan Dean stone Pete Williams our understanding is the heart of this search is tied to a possible payment involving stormy Daniels she's the adult film actress that's obviously been in the news who said that she had an affair with the president and said that Rishi received $130,000 payment in her she goes by her legal name Stephanie Clifford so we understand that the the bulk of this search that we've been led to believe is tied to a possible payment from Michael Cohen the president's personal attorney just before Election Day to stormy Daniels so that's that's kind of the basis of this search this is the second known time that Muller's office has come across a across a possible crime and they've referred it to the Southern District of New York the first time was a story that we broke here at NBC News involving an investigation into Paul Manafort in a Chicago banker named Stephen caulk and a possible quid pro quo between the two in order to get mr. caulk a position on the in the Trump White House or some part of this administration so this is not I don't think we're in any usual waters here but this is something that we have seen before in this investigation there are reports out there the president's watching the news coverage of his longtime friend confidant fixer attorney Michael Cohen the rated when we're talking about pardons and we've been talking about that in the case of Paul Manafort he can't pardon Michael Cohen for a state crime if the state of New York finds him guilty of a crime so I mean we're we're jumping ahead they haven't done that yet these are just a search warrant but talk about why this could potentially inoculate a section of the Moller investor right now actually it can't because at this point this is still a federal investigation so while there prosecutors are based here in Manhattan it's known as the Southern District of New York it's this this particular district in New York State but it is a federal investigation so at this point the president would have some purview over over that there are various state and local the Manhattan DA's office has an investigation going on into some parts of Paul Manafort and his business transactions and maybe some other areas and then of course the Attorney General in New York Eric Schneiderman has his own investigation into similar matters so so those investigations to your point would be protected if there ever were charges brought from any sort of presidential pardon but at this point this would fall under the president's purview I just think it's a it's we cannot underscore enough this afternoon that federal investigators found enough probable cause to go to a judge get a search warrant and send FBI agents in there was no announcement this is not something where they where they send you a subpoena or call you up and say hey Katie you're gonna get a notice we want your emails from last November and you know your lawfully bound to send them all over to us this is we're taking the records they're not photocopy on-site they'll return the records at some point but they're taking everything they think they need to do a major federal criminal investigation so this is something that is a significant step forward and Mimi if you're still with us as Tom pointed out this is an incredibly aggressive move by FBI agents by the Southern District of New York again Michael Cohen is has been friends with Donald Trump for years he is his confidant his fixer he has told me in the past that he would take a bullet for Donald Trump and I have every reason to believe that he would he's very Cerre when he talks about the president I haven't heard heard him ever utter a single even remotely negative thing about him he's very protective of the president of United States he has always been that for them them to get as close or that close to someone as close to the president what does that say to you well I think it's gonna be interesting to see as I said before what the crimes are that they're looking at certainly it's it's going to be the campaign finance possible campaign finance fraud but my my hunch is there it's gonna be more than that so we know it's going to be in large part about the payments to stormy Daniels but you can have actions you know constitute more than one crime so it may not only be campaign finance we need to find out we still don't know the source of that money that that was paid to her there could be you know that the scope of this search suggests to me that it there may be other crimes that that he's going to be possibly looking at and so if that's the case not the campaign finance of itself a serious violation but if you think there are other serious federal crimes like you know money laundering tax fraud he could be mr. Cohen could be looking at some real trouble and and you know we we see have seen what happens with people under federal investigation who are facing a lot of criminal exposure they many do you end up cooperating even people against their own family members so I understand that he has a lot of loyalty to mr. chunk but you never know Tom you know Katie I've been trying to think for the last 10-15 minutes here the only other person I believe that we know that a FBI court authorized search has been conducted on his Paul Manafort so when you think of all the players in this case and that's something we'll go back and double-check but when you think of all the potential people that we've written about that we've talked about and the headlines that have filled your shows throughout the course of the year to have only two people that have received this type of level of intrusion its court authorized its lawful under the Constitution I think it's pretty significant and obviously we know the the world that Paul Manafort sin so that might be a little bit of a signal regarding mr. Cohen listen I can't think of anything anybody more significant to raid right now then Michael Cohen unless you're looking at Donald Trump's family Michael Cohen just has so much information about Donald Trump in such a long history and relationship we should also note that as of right now our latest guidance was that Michael Cohen has not yet been interviewed by the special counsel despite that he is a subject for the special counsel in the sense that we know that people who have gone in for questioning have been asked about Michael Cohen I don't know if he's technically officially a subject but the thinking around Cohen and around the Trump orbit is that hey if you haven't been interviewed by now by the special counsel and you're somewhat of a player in this things are not looking good for you so you know I think to continue that I think the fact that you know some folks had predicted that this investigation was wrapping up or in its final days and I think when you start to look at you know you have a give a fresh search warrant that was executed today you continue to have the grand jury impaneled we have some knowledge of that based on some of the folks we've seen around the courthouse here at NBC News so I think when you look at that it doesn't signal to me that that they're out of leads and that's you know that a report is imminent but you know obviously we what they're doing versus what we know there's a quite a bit of Lex we'll have to see how that progresses I can again this could have nothing to do with the President of the United States it could be all entirely focused on Michael Cohen and Michael what Michael Cohen did but certainly they're gonna be able to gather some information about communications sensitive indeed Tom winter appreciate it good reporting having me roca thank you for all of that insight appreciate it as well hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
