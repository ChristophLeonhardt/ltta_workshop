1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:01,386
DISASTER.

2
00:00:01,386 --> 00:00:10,628
THIS IS "SPECIAL REPORT" ."

3
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:11,362
GOOD EVENING.

4
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:11,830
I'M BRET BAIER.

YORBA LINDA CALIFORNIA.

9
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,607
PART OF A TWO WEEK TOUR.

10
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,409
WHAT COULD BE A MAJOR STEP

11
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,044
BACKWARD IN THE EFFORT TO

12
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:27,445
ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF

13
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,746
NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS

14
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:29,080
PROGRAM.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,215
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THERE'S A

16
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:32,417
GOOD CHANCE NEXT MONTH'S PLANNED

17
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,619
SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN WILL NOT

18
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,820
HAPPEN ON SCHEDULE.

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,255
THE PRESIDENT INDICATING TODAY

20
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:39,257
THE MEETING WILL EITHER BE ON

21
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:41,025
HIS TERMS OR IT WON'T HAPPEN AT

22
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:41,292
ALL.

23
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,028
AND IT COULD VERY WELL BE

24
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:46,064
DELAYED AS A POSSIBILITY.

25
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:47,866
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT

26
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:49,434
JOHN ROBERTS STARTS US OFF FROM

27
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:50,735
THE NORTH LAWN TONIGHT WITH

28
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,036
WHERE THE SUMMITS PROSPECTS ARE.

29
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:53,071
GOOD EVENING.

30
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:54,873
>> GOOD EVENING.

31
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:56,141
IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY,

32
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,108
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THE CHANCES

33
00:00:57,108 --> 00:01:00,612
OF A SUMMIT BETWEEN HIM AND

34
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:01,613
NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN

35
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:04,415
IS BASICALLY A COIN FLIP.

36
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:05,683
50/50, THE PRESIDENT SAID.

37
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,652
THE WHITE HOUSE IS STILL MAKING

38
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:11,222
PLANS.

39
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:12,624
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY

40
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:14,425
STATED THAT THE SUMMIT WITH

41
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,059
KIM JONG UN MAY HAPPEN.

42
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,227
IT MAY NOT HAPPEN.

43
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:17,829
WE WILL SEE.

44
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,864
IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY WITH

45
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:20,532
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON

46
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:22,467
JAE-IN, THE PRESIDENT WENT

47
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:23,434
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO

48
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,037
PESSIMISM THAT HE HAS THUS FAR.

49
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,005
>> VERY SUBSTANTIAL CHANCE THAT

50
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,640
IT WON'T WORK OUT AND THAT'S

51
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,007
OKAY.

52
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,909
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T WORK

53
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,510
OUT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME BUT IT

54
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,078
MAY NOT WORK OUT FOR JUNE 12.

55
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:35,513
SPEAK WITH THE PRESIDENT'S

56
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,649
REMARKS FLEW IN THE FACE OF THE

57
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:38,449
SOUTH KOREAN NATIONAL SECURITY

58
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:39,851
ADVISOR WHO SAID JUST HOURS

59
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:42,820
EARLIER THERE WAS A 99% CHANCE

60
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,857
THE MEETING WILL HAPPEN.

61
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,225
LATER THIS AFTERNOON, SECRETARY

62
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:47,959
OF STATE MIKE POMPEO SAID THE

63
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,626
STATE DEPARTMENT IS STILL

64
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:51,696
WORKING FOR THE JUNE 12 DATE AND

65
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,097
THAT THE U.S. IS IN DEEP

66
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:54,666
DISCUSSIONS WITH NORTH KOREA

67
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,133
OVER SUBSTANCE.

68
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,535
>> WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE

69
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:58,937
THERE IS A COMMON UNDERSTANDING

70
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:09,781
OF THE CONTENTS DISCUSSED BUT I

71
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,215
AM OPTIMISTIC.

72
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:10,914
AGAIN, THIS COULD BE SOMETHING

73
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:11,583
THAT COMES RIGHT TO THE END.

74
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,250
>> TODAY NORTH KOREA INVITED

75
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:12,984
JOURNALISTS TO ITS NUCLEAR TEST

76
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:13,918
SITE WHICH NORTH KOREA SAYS IS

77
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:14,919
BEING DECOMMISSIONED.

78
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,487
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE SITE

79
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:20,225
WAS EVEN USABLE AFTER THE LAST

80
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,426
NUCLEAR TEST REPORTEDLY

81
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:22,460
COLLAPSED TUNNELS.

82
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,695
PRESIDENT TRUMP REPEATED TODAY

83
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:24,829
THAT KIM WILL RECEIVE

84
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,464
PROTECTIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR

85
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:28,233
DISMANTLING HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

86
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,701
>> WE WILL GUARANTEE SAFETY AND

87
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:30,435
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT FROM

88
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:32,904
THE BEGINNING.

89
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:35,440
HE WILL BE SAFE.

90
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,575
HE WILL BE HAPPY.

91
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:38,243
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPRESSED

92
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,445
FRUSTRATION THAT NORTH KOREA'S

93
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:42,447
RECENT SQUISHING US ABOUT A

94
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,716
SUMMIT SEEMED TO COINCIDE WITH A

95
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:47,018
SECOND MEETING KIM HAD WITH

96
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:48,219
CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING ON

97
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:48,620
MAY 8.

98
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,054
>> THE SECOND MEETING, I THINK

99
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:52,523
THERE WAS A LITTLE CHANGE IN

100
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:54,425
ATTITUDE FROM KIM JONG UN.

101
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,627
SO I DON'T LIKE THAT.

102
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:56,628
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

103
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:57,829
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID

104
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,697
HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH HOW TRADE

105
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:01,666
TALKS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA

106
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,234
HAVE BEEN GOING.

107
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,436
DESPITE TWEETING THAT CHINA HAS

108
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,538
AGREED TO BUY MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF

109
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:08,640
ADDITIONAL FARM AGRICULTURAL

110
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,041
PRODUCTS WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST

111
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,243
THINGS TO HAPPEN TO OUR FARMERS

112
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:13,411
AND MANY YEARS.

113
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:14,646
THE PRESIDENT INSISTS HE HAS NOT

114
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:16,381
CUT A DEAL TO SAVE CHINESE

115
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:22,920
TELECOM GIANT ZTE, THOUGH HE HAS

116
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,823
SOME IDEAS TO KEEP THEM IN

117
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:26,190
BUSINESS.

118
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,625
>> I ENVISION A VERY LARGE FIND

119
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,860
OF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS.

120
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,163
COULD BE A BILLION .3.

121
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:36,401
I ENVISION NEW MANAGEMENT, NEW

122
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,003
BOARD, VERY STRICT SECURITY

123
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:40,772
RULES AND I ENVISION THEY HAVE

124
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:44,075
TO BUY A BIG PERCENTAGE OF THEIR

125
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:46,844
PARTS AND EQUIPMENT FROM

126
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:47,412
AMERICAN COMPANIES.

127
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:48,479
>> TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN

128
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,050
MNUCHIN WAS PUMMELED WITH

129
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,619
QUESTIONS ABOUT ZTE ON

130
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,653
CAPITOL HILL TODAY.

131
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,422
AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH

132
00:03:57,422 --> 00:03:58,089
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE SENATE

133
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:58,756
MINORITY LEADER CAME AWAY

134
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:00,425
WORRYING THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL

135
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,060
GO SOFT ON ZTE TO KEEP

136
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,860
XI JINPING HAPPY.

137
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,862
>> WE ARE PRESSING THE PRESIDENT

138
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:06,831
TO STAND FIRM, NOT TO LET ZTE

139
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,866
WRIGGLE OUT FROM UNDER THE TOUGH

140
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,835
SANCTIONS WE LEVELED ON THEM.

141
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:11,936
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD SOME

142
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,472
IDEAS TODAY OF HOW HE SEES THE

143
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:16,040
LONG GAME WITH NORTH KOREA.

144
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,110
IN THE SHORT TERM, THE PRESIDENT

145
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,478
ENVISIONS TWO KOREA'S PROSPEROUS

146
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,346
AND LIVING IN PEACEFUL

147
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:21,745
COEXISTENCE.

148
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,915
HE DID SAY HE WOULD ULTIMATELY

149
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,850
LIKE TO SEE A REUNIFIED KOREAN

150
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,419
PENINSULA BUT ONLY IF THE TWO

151
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,822
COUNTRIES WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN.

152
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:31,956
NO IMPOSITION OF SUCH AN IDEA

153
00:04:31,956 --> 00:00:00,000
FROM THE UNITED STATES.
