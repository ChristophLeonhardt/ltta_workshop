26
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,907
I’VE BEEN BUSY. I HAVEN’T BEEN FOLLOWING THIS --

27
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:41,908
I HAVEN’T BEEN FOLLOWING THIS -- THE HEARINGS.

28
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,912
THE HEARINGS. WHAT I HEARD, THE DISCUSSION,

29
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,149
WHAT I HEARD, THE DISCUSSION, BETWEEN SENATOR DURBIN AND

30
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,218
BETWEEN SENATOR DURBIN AND KAVANAUGH WAS HIGH BROW.

31
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,986
KAVANAUGH WAS HIGH BROW. IT WASN’T ANYBODY SHOUTING OR

32
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:55,088
IT WASN’T ANYBODY SHOUTING OR ANY CHAOS THAT WAS IN THAT ROOM.

33
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,623
ANY CHAOS THAT WAS IN THAT ROOM. IT’S GOING TO BE A MATTER OF

34
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,059
IT’S GOING TO BE A MATTER OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW PEOPLE

35
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,127
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO AT THE END

36
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,628
ARE GOING TO AT THE END DETERMINE WHETHER THEY CAN

37
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,097
DETERMINE WHETHER THEY CAN SUPPORT CAVANAUGH OR WHETHER

38
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,199
SUPPORT CAVANAUGH OR WHETHER THEY CAN’T.

39
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,034
THEY CAN’T. BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING,

40
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,369
BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING, EVEN THERE, IN PARTICULARLY IN

41
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:10,337
EVEN THERE, IN PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST DAY OF THE HEARINGS,

42
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,239
THE FIRST DAY OF THE HEARINGS, JUST A COUPLE DAYS AFTER PEOPLE

43
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,208
JUST A COUPLE DAYS AFTER PEOPLE REFLECTED ON THE LIFE OF JOHN

44
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:15,843
REFLECTED ON THE LIFE OF JOHN McCAIN WAS JUST MORE CHAOS

45
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:16,243
McCAIN WAS JUST MORE CHAOS EVERYWHERE.

46
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,647
EVERYWHERE. I MEAN, WE SEE THE CHAOS IN THE

47
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,047
I MEAN, WE SEE THE CHAOS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

48
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:21,415
WHITE HOUSE. WE SEE THE CHAOS ON CAPITOL

49
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:21,849

50
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,051

53
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,357
WOULDN’T BE SO FIXATED. I KNOW THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES,

54
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,626
I KNOW THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES, BUT THERE’S LIMITED THINGS THAT

WHAT I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO FOCUS ON, BECAUSE WASHINGTON IS

60
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:41,935
FOCUS ON, BECAUSE WASHINGTON IS NOT WORKING.

61
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,138
NOT WORKING. IT HASN’T BEEN WORKING FOR A

62
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:44,872
IT HASN’T BEEN WORKING FOR A LONG TIME.

63
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,707

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,844
>> I DON’T WAIT FOR WASHINGTON TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS.

101
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,347
TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. I MEAN, ONE OF THE THINGS I

I MEAN, ONE OF THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT TODAY, THE FOLKS IN

103

TALKED ABOUT TODAY, THE FOLKS IN CINCINNATI, IN AN INTERVIEW, IS

104
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:02,750
CINCINNATI, IN AN INTERVIEW, IS THE FACT THAT IT’S REALLY GOOD.

105
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,652
THE FACT THAT IT’S REALLY GOOD. I DIDN’T GET THIS SPECIFIC, BUT

WE CAN SUPPLY THE RESOURCES. WE CAN TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER.

119
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:30,879
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER. I DON’T LIKE THE FACT THAT

I DON’T LIKE THE FACT THAT WASHINGTON’S BROKEN.

121
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:33,448
WASHINGTON’S BROKEN. I WAS THERE WHEN IT DID WORK.

122
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,784
I WAS THERE WHEN IT DID WORK. WHEN WE BALANCED BUDGETS.

123
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,155
WHEN WE BALANCED BUDGETS. WHEN WE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE.

124
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,590
WHEN WE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE. TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE

00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:06,381
CONCERNED ABOUT, ANDREA. I’M CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIVISION

I’M CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIVISION IN OUR COUNTRY.

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,985
IN OUR COUNTRY. I SEE THERE HAVE BEEN THREE

143
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:10,685
I SEE THERE HAVE BEEN THREE POLLS WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS

144
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:13,021
POLLS WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN LESS THAN 40% APPROVAL.

145
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,523
GOTTEN LESS THAN 40% APPROVAL. DOESN’T MAKE ME HAPPY.

146
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:16,625
DOESN’T MAKE ME HAPPY. WE SEE CHAOS IN OUR, YOU KNOW,

147
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,159
WE SEE CHAOS IN OUR, YOU KNOW, BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND

148
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:20,228
BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, BUT THEN I LOOK AT

149
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,531
DEMOCRATS, BUT THEN I LOOK AT THE FOREIGN POLICY LANDSCAPE AND

150
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:25,701
THE FOREIGN POLICY LANDSCAPE AND I SEE US BATTLING WITH TURKEY,

151

I SEE US BATTLING WITH TURKEY, BATTLING WITH IRAN, BATTLING

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,550
JAPAN. WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS CONFLICT
