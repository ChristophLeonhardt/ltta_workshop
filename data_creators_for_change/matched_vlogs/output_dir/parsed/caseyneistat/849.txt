it's important to take a minute in the
day and take care of yourself and you've
never had a facial before Casey which is
just crazy
Casey you're gonna be so spoiled after
this I mean as a model I don't know what
it said I think you should be I think
you should be offended you weren't
invited to be on the September issue
cover the magic happens
I'm trying to do it everyday
what's your favorite kiss
are you making friends
okay cocky buh-bye
the Oscar de la Renta Express I'm not
gonna reverse so let's go choose
everybody
okay without opening your eyes I'll see
you later Carly good luck out there
the elevator to go downstairs leaving
you no good day all right it's a wrap
I hope you so it's now 37 35 I think
this prayer too I have one question to
end this movie with it would be why did
you insist on us both wearing sunglasses
tonight by Carly thank you for a great
day
