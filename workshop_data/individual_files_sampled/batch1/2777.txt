the food has been great the music entertainment was astounding in terms of experiencing that a North Korean culture will taste like North Korea's government owns and operates around 130 restaurants across Asia the restaurants are called Pyongyang named after the capital of North Korea serving North Korean food and liquor and featuring live music the chain offers visitors a rare glimpse into the reclusive nation's culture the food is excellent actually tokyo-based videoblogger eco simon visited the pyongyang restaurant in Dalian China it looked like fairly standard Korean food that was very various sort of kimchi various sort of soups and meats and so on it wasn't that much to look at but it really was very good it was root tasty the beer as well I can tell you tasted a bit like like tin cow it was one of those sort of light Swedish kind of you know sort of beers that they make in China but I had to say I wasn't expecting much of the food again you just have this idea that it's a it's a resource poor country that you didn't take the food to be a little bit austere or something the waitstaff is made up of only young North Korean women they serve food perform pop songs and traditional Korean music and chat with the diners the people who are serving your meal they sit down at your table and you get to chat with them for time and ask them about North Korea may ask about Japan alone and then they go up and they sing they dance they do they play multiple instruments you know I've never experienced anything like that at all I suppose the pyongyang restaurant chain generates about ten million dollars for North Korea each year but here's the catch the restaurants are a direct violation of UN sanctions the United Nations Security Council has required any country in the world that's remember the United Nations to enforce sanctions on North Korea to limit its access to foreign currency and to foreign products and these are very wide range with sanctions and they include things like allowing them to operate joint ventures or businesses in your country so the United Nations has passed this resolution it was agreed to by all the major countries including China and the United States but it's up to each individual country to enforce those sanctions and so country's there you know could choose to either look the other way or lightly enforce it or not enforce it at all pyongyang employees are selected by the government and kept under a watchful eye the one thing that is interesting about these businesses is that what it requires North Korea to do is send its own people out into the world in North Korea you're not actually allowed to leave the country that's why people call it a prison camp you have to get special permission and it's really hard to get and almost no one gets to go abroad and when they do go abroad they're tightly sort of isolated and kept away I just appreciated the fact that sort of humanized the image of the country or just a little bit while at the same time still having all that thing that you know you know the month the restaurants there for hard currency for the regime and the people there are not strictly free they are they have minders you know they they they can go out and town with minders and so on but basically they live in a dorm attached to the restaurant but it didn't there wasn't it didn't feel like guys at a prison camp or being spied upon as much as you might expect that to me it actually surprised me at how normal it was which you know and it was a pleasant evening in spite of pest knowing what else going on the restaurants made news in 2016 when a crew of 13 workers defected to South Korea South Korea's foreign ministry has advised people to not dine in Pyongyang restaurants because the profits benefit the Kim regime but with warming relations between North Korea and the rest of the world these chains may become less taboo in the future
