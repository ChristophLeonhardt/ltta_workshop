Hey, this is Rian Johnson.
I wrote and directed
“Star Wars:
The Last Jedi."
So this is the Battle
of Crait, which
is the big battle at
the end of the movie.
And here, we wanted
to make these craft
that they’re in,
these ski speeders,
as rickety as possible.
Everything from the sound design
to the way ILM animated them —
you can just see everything
is wobbling on these things,
even having the open canopy so
our heroes feel very exposed.
And you just want to feel like
this is David versus Goliath.
Even them falling apart, this
little gag here, just feeling
like, what are they doing?
They’re in basically
rolling lawnmowers going up
against these massive tanks.
Bob Ducsay, our
editor, cut together
this little Star Wars-y
montage, which I love so much.
It just feels like our brave
heroes going into battle.
And then I love this
moment with Kelly.
It’s so relatable.
It’s a big, heroic moment,
but you see she’s scared.
And then you see that
she takes some strength
and goes into battle.
So this is all about
geography, this big pan
here, establishing very
clearly the two lines of battle
and establishing the door right
there that’s the objective.
And that’s why we do
these camera moves that
are very wide-angle
lenses and very clearly
show you the layout
of everything —
so that when we
get into the battle
here, when the fighters come
and you see, once again,
our heroes don’t have a chance,
it’s like hawks versus mice,
we can just go nuts
and get into the fun
of the red and the white.
The red and white
landscape — originally
it was something I came up with
because in a PG-13 Star Wars
movie, you can’t really show
the violence of a battle.
You can’t show blood.
And the idea of the
landscape expressing
that violence in a
very bold, graphic way
was something I thought
could be interesting.
