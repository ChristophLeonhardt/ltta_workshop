1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,735
[singing]: “It’s
Friday, Friday.”

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:04,019
Remember Rebecca Black?

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,680
She was the 13-year-old girl
who made a music video with

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,948
her friends about —

5
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:09,811
[singing]: “Friday, Friday.”

6
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:10,310
— Fridays.

7
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,330
[singing]: “Friday, Friday,
Friday, Friday, Friday,

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,895
Friday, Friday.”

9
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:19,160
Now, years after being
tossed around the internet

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,500
as a viral spectacle,
Rebecca seems

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,041
to have found a kind of
peaceful equilibrium.

12
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:28,990
She’s reemerged on a
new platform, Cameo.

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,620
It’s a service
that lets fans pay

14
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,930
low- to mid-range
celebrities to send them

15
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,835
personalized video messages.

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,630
“Hi, Sarah.

17
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,690
What’s up, Steven?

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,715
Hi, Tanya!”

19
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,320
Fans approach
Rebecca to wring out

20
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,260
the last drops of her
fame, and she responds

21
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,285
with acceptance and grace.

22
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:45,265
“Happy birthday.”

23
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:48,309
She even performs a ukulele
version of the song for them.

24
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,671
[singing]: “Friday, Friday.”

25
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,380
For that, she gets 30 bucks.

26
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,500
And her fan?

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,090
Her fan gets to perform a kind
of celebrity ventriloquism.

28
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,940
With Cameo, you can
almost project your voice

29
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,815
through a celebrity host.

30
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:04,940
“What’s going on, Caroline?

31
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,065
It is Lance Bass.”

32
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:06,982
“Caitlyn Jenner here.”

33
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:07,481
“What’s up?

34
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,165
It’s Mike Vick.”

35
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,005
You write the
script, they say it.

36
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:10,505
“Fish.

37
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,181
I guess your name is Fish.”

38
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,055
“It’s your birthday.”

39
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:14,325
“It’s your bar mitzvah.”

40
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,110
“Mazel tov.”

41
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,940
“I hear that you’re
about to retire.

42
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,720
Good for you.”

43
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,450
It’s like the “Being
John Malkovich” of apps,

44
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,970
and it represents this
totally new frontier

45
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,310
in fan-celebrity relations.

46
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,910
Traditionally, a celebrity
encounter works one way:

47
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,070
We recognize a
famous person and they

48
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,500
have no idea who we are.

49
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,140
Receiving a Cameo
simulates the feeling

50
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,895
of being recognized back.

51
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:38,620
“Hey, Amanda.”

52
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,587
“Hello, Amanda.”

53
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:40,170
“Hey, Amanda.”

54
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,195
“What up, Amanda?”

55
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:42,230
Hey, guys.

56
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,860
I just bought a whole
bunch of Cameos for myself.

57
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,305
And because I’m a sadist,
I paid them all to say —

58
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:48,950
“Peter Piper.”

59
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,625
“Peter Piper.”

60
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,208
“Peter Piper.”

61
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,430
“Peter Piper
picked a peck of —”

62
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,190
“Pickled peppers.”

63
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,940
“Pickled peppers.”

64
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
“Pickled peppers.

65
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,990
How’d he do that?

66
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,875
I don’t know.”

67
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,340
We commoners have always had
an ambivalent relationship

68
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,117
with the stars.

69
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:04,415
“Leave Britney alone!”

70
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,130
We admire them
and we resent them.

71
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,169
We want to be more
like them and we

72
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,690
want them to be
more like us.

73
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,370
On the internet,
a famous person

74
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,600
is no longer just an
idol for us to inspect.

75
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,780
They become a skin to inhabit.

76
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,450
This impulse can express
itself pretty innocently,

77
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,370
like in the celebrity
fan fiction that

78
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,820
just wants to imagine
famous people falling in love

79
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,032
and kissing each other.

80
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:30,740
“What’s up, guys?

81
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,570
It’s Shawn Mendes, and I’m
about to read a fan fiction

82
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,595
about me called, ‘A
Shawn Mendes Love Story.’”

83
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:38,390
But if we used to do that by
Xeroxing fanzines or starting

84
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,500
fan clubs —

85
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,320
“The Mr. Belvedere Fun Kit!”

86
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,060
— now that process feels
a lot more immediate

87
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,920
and powerful, too.

88
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,340
At its most extreme,
fan-generated content can be

89
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,970
super creepy, like when a
community of Redditors used

90
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,550
machine learning to
create deep fakes —

91
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,890
highly realistic
fake porn that

92
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,040
grafts Hollywood
actresses’ faces

93
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,540
onto porn performers’ bodies.

94
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,270
It’s no longer enough to
feel like a contributor

95
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,980
to a celebrity image.

96
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,210
We want the sensation of
pulling their strings.

97
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,820
The internet gives us the
tools to build stars up

98
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,740
and to tear them down.

99
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,170
And those tools
can be so powerful

100
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,820
that they can disrupt
the celebrity’s

101
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,330
official image-making machine.

102
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,500
After a bunch of trolls started
spreading lies on Twitter

103
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,180
that painted the beloved
14-year-old actress

104
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,040
Millie Bobby Brown as a bigot,
she deleted her account.

105
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,940
Celebrities used to cut
deals with the tabloids,

106
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,630
offering access to avert
more damaging storylines.

107
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,470
Now they’re negotiating
directly with the public.

108
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,020
Internet-savvy celebrities
submit themselves

109
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,380
to fan access in
controlled ways.

110
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,330
They release
Instagram filters to let

111
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,610
you wear their famous face.

112
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,310
They literally deliver
presents to your house

113
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,890
and film it for YouTube.

114
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,720
Cameo represents
the height of this —

115
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,620
famous people actually
accepting real money

116
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,550
to say what we
want them to.

117
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,183
“You are a great dancer.”

118
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:09,220
“You are a cool mom.”

119
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,410
“You are the best there is.”

120
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,975
“And you are amazing parents.”

121
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:13,465
“That’s cool.”

122
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:15,660
There’s something a
little sad about that —

123
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,290
that we want them to do
this and that they will.

124
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,040
Famous people are less famous
than they have ever been.

125
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,730
It almost feels like we’re
on the same level now —

126
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,727
them and us.

127
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:29,060
“Don’t know why
I just did this.

128
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,860
Anyways.”

129
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,462
Except they’re the
ones making 30 bucks.

130
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:32,962
“Bye.

131
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:33,908
Bye, bye!

132
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:34,408
Bye.”

133
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:38,165
“Hey, I’m Amanda.”

134
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:38,970
“I’m Shane.”

135
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,026
“He edits the videos.”

136
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,172
“She writes the videos”

137
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:42,362
“You watch the videos.’

138
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:43,310
“And if you like the video,

139
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,042
like, comment and subscribe here.”

140
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,242
“And then tell us:

141
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,993
How are you dehumanizing
your favorite celebrity?”

142
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,644
“Quite viciously, myself.

143
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,104
Leave your answer here in the comments.”

144
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,261
“We are very thirsty.”

145
00:04:54,261 --> 00:00:00,000
“Internetting
with Amanda Hess.”
