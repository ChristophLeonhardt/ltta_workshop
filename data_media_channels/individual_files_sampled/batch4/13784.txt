so do you remember those two FBI agents who had worked on the Muller investigation and openly talked about an insurance policy to undo the election in case Trump won so it turns out the FBI lost all of their text messages from December 2016 all the way up until precisely the day before the Muller investigation began whoops will analyze the seemingly endless innocent little old coincidences and why the government needs to find the texts or fire Muller then conservative leaders Steve lonegan and Vincent buta joined the panel of deplorable to discuss whether there's any hope for a daca deal what the turpan house of horrors means for home schooling and the new CNN poll that shows Biden Bernie and Oprah all leading Trump in 2020 I wonder if that poll is like all the other CNN polls that had Hillary crushing Trump in 2016 we'll find out I'm Michael Knowles's as the Michael Nolt show before we get started today just a shameless personal plug the Oscar nominations are out I'm not going to talk about them because no one has seen any of the movies but we're nominated I've missed about half of them and I live in Hollywood and I'm in this industry so I'm not gonna talk about that what I will talk about though is act like good culture actual culture not these ridiculous movies that no one goes and sees and then Hollywood gives each other golden statues for it I mean actual culture that Hollywood can't stop and gatekeepers can't stop so andrew Clavin and I have just completed another Kingdom which is a narrative podcast it's fairly innovative I don't think anything like it has ever come out on the right if at all if on either side of the philosophical spectrum and it's a great story about a 30 year old Hollywood schlub who can't get a job in Hollywood I'm not sure why he would ever cast me I don't have no idea and he walks through a portal into another Kingdom and he's in another dimension with damsels and ogres and a bloody dagger and a dead woman at his feet and we I know it sounds like Hollywood but that's actually the other Kingdom so this has been a 13-part series it's been a lot of fun I'm performing all of the roles and work live and wrote it it's called another Kingdom please go check it out right now you can binge the whole thing so if you want to just set it on your on a long car ride you just can play them right in a row feel free to do that we really appreciate it leave us a five star review that helps us out a lot of Hollywood production houses and and Studios have called us about it and then the night before the meeting they Google Android clayvin and then they the meeting goes terrible so we want to force it down their throats and put a stick in their eye so please go to its another Kingdom Andrew Clavin it's another Kingdom you can get it anywhere fine narrative podcasts by conservatives and bloody daggered clothing anywhere you can download those that's where you get it ok let's get into some politics it sure looks like the fix was in in 2016 new documents show a lot of collusion in the 2016 presidential campaign not collusion with Trump and Vladimir or Boris or Natasha but between democrats and barack obama's corrupt administrative agencies these texts and documents and deleted texts and classified documents are all early confusing so let's go through it carefully and get a broad view because this is what they're counting on Democrats are counting on this issue being so confusing so opaque the timeline is so unclear was so long ago that Americans will just throw up their hands and ignore what seems from every indication to be rank corruption this all begins with two FBI agents Peter struck and that name by the way it's spelled strug's ah gah gah course um it's got like 15 sales and or 15 consonants in it rather Peter struts oughta talk and Lisa Paige struck helped lay the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server and he was involved in opening the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election he was reassigned off of Muller's team to HR duty when text messages turned up demonstrating him clearly colluding with other FBI officials to sabotage Trump's campaign from within the government struck was the number-two official in counterintelligence and the leading Russia expert he was sleeping with another FBI agent Lisa page because it's Washington DC so of course he was sleeping with this other FBI agent his girlfriend and co-conspirator Lisa Paige was also on the mother team before returning to the FBI but she had finished her assignment already before all of these texts came out so she didn't have the opportunity to be fired the day after President Trump was elected president struck in Paige texted about a secret society within the Department of Justice and the FBI working against Trump working against the democratically elected president was the exact word secret society hears House Oversight chairman trey Gowdy on the recent findings we need to know a couple of things number one we need to know how the world's premiere law enforcement agency managed to lose five months worth of tax and what's also troubling is in the text we do have they're discussing how to avoid text being captured and secured so what's missing is important but but also what's there is important it is manifest bias not just against Trump but against his kids against this business interest there's a text where they hope the Trump Hotel fails that is a level of bias that you rarely see and you never see from law enforcement officers what's also troubling to me is this text that Johnny Radcliffe found last night about this secret society now I have no clue what that means because that was not the phraseology I used but it's the day after the election then it's the same two people that were discussing a little bit later in the text the damage they had done with the Clinton investigation and how they could quote fix it and make it right that is a level of bias that is stunning among law enforcement has been right so there may have been a secret society within the DOJ and FBI working against Trump including page and struck you'll remember the first text exchange that set off all of these questions about whether the FBI and the DOJ were biased against Trump from the beginning if this entire investigation into Trump was just a ruse to rout him out of office if it was funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party the first text which came out in December was sent in August 2016 in the final months of the 2016 presidential election struck wrote two-page quote I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration that there's no way he gets elected but I'm afraid we can't take that risk it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40 it's like an insurance policy what is it is it referring to the investigation into Russian interference is it referring to the Obama administration's pretext for spying on the Trump campaign which we know he did what is it what is the insurance policy by the way Andy here refers to Deputy FBI director Andy McCain so it appears whatever political dealings in government they're talking about go all the way up to the upper most Ashlyn's of the FBI Trump himself called this exchange treason and he's right this is an attempt of the bureaucracy to subvert our democratic republic I had the privilege of speaking to Antonin Scalia about the federal bureaucracy before he died I said what's the greatest threat to freedom in America to the Republic he said the unaccountable executive agencies the federal bureaucracies the greatest threat to Liberty we might be seeing that play out Struck's flax insist that the insurance policy reference was meant to convey that the FBI needed to thoroughly and lawfully investigate any improper interference in the election you know just do our job very well give me a break the implication then if that's the case the implication is that the FBI typically doesn't do its job is that what struck is saying the FBI doesn't normally do its job so to get the FBI to do its job would be an insurance policy in the unthinking event that the in the unthinkable event rather that the American people elect the president of their choice so even if Struck's account were credible and it's not the implication would be that the FBI is so hopelessly partisan and corrupt that the FBI is following the law and doing its job would be out of the ordinary but then again Struck's account is not credible struck a shot back through his attorney who said quote it is beyond reckless for the President of the United States to accuse pete's truck a man who has devoted his entire adult life to defending this country of treason can we get Benin to play the violin for this absurd corrupt hack it should surprise no one that the president has both the facts and the law wrong is that right mr. struck or rather it mr. struts a lawyer because mr. struck won't say anything on record because he was caught red-handed conspiring with the Democrats to overturn an American presidential election struck by the way has retained all-star lawyer David Boies that's a Harvey Weinstein's lawyer it's one of the most expensive lawyers in DC interesting that he would be able to retain someone so expensive on an FBI salary because you know he gave his whole life just to serve his country is just a faithful public servant isn't he but somehow you can afford the most expensive lawyer in the country to defend him against this these charges of corruption gross corruption subverting a democratic election so this guy the lawyer is worth pointing it's worth pointing on he is from the same firm as Karen Dunn who was slated to become Hillary's White House Counsel had she defeated Donald Trump I just want to point that out I'm not making any any allegations just just pointing out that strange coincidence so that that's what's reckless mm-hmm now we have an investigation apparently triggered by a senior FBI official who is desperately opposed to Trump who refers in a text to his colleague and lover same say colleague / lover another senior FBI official to an insurance policy a fail-safe to take Trump out in the event the American people actually elect him an insurance policy that was apparently cooked up in the office of the deputy director of the FBI those privately now uncovered text exchanges also strongly imply that former FBI director James Comey was lying when he insisted that he had not decided against charging Hillary Clinton until after he interviewed her here's Comey did you make the decision not to recommend criminal charges relating to classified information before or after Hillary Clinton was interviewed by the FBI on July the second after all I can do is tell you again the decision was made after that because I didn't know what was gonna happen in that interview was that right James that's right now you know someone would lie this brazenly you know while testifying be if he thinks there's no way he's gonna get caught there's no it's just a little of course I made the decision afterward that's just a thing that politicians would say unfortunately here looks like he got caught the text suggests otherwise other than his testimony when Obama's Attorney General Loretta Lynch stated that she would accept whatever recommendation the FBI made regarding a prosecution of Hillary Clinton Paige wrote quote this is a purposeful leak following the airplane snafu purposeful leak of course we all knew it was and the airplane snafu was when Bill Clinton met privately with Loretta Lynch on an airplane presumably to pressure her to let Hillary off the hook maybe he threatened to suicide her if she didn't know I'm kidding that's a joke am i I don't know and now who knows what they said I wasn't there but in any case struck replied quote timing looks like hell will appear to be choreographed uh yeah yep it looks choreographed it's true I wonder why it looks so choreographed but then Paige replied quote yeah it's a real Profile in Courage since she knows no charges will be brought since Loretta Lynch Obama's Attorney General knows no charges will be brought that exchanges from July 1st hmm Hillary Clinton was interviewed by the FBI on July 2nd July 1st July say I'm no mathematician but I'm pretty sure July 1st come before July 2nd which means we have a text from the day before her interviewing her interview asserting that everybody including Loretta Lynch and James Comey knew at least the day before Hillary's interview that they would never charge her so it looks like there was collusion after all not between Trump and Khrushchev or whatever nonsense they're alleging now but between Barack Obama's corrupt administration with its various unaccountable bureaucratic agencies and the Hillary Clinton campaign for president in light of all of this and calls from senior members of both parties including Senate Majority Leader's than a Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to fire James Comey Trump fired James Comey James Comey with said let go for which he is now being investigated for obstruction of justice and now Trump summed this up well to The Wall Street Journal he said of course there was no obstruction there was no crime they make up a crime and the crime doesn't exist and then they say obstruction everybody wanted Comey fired I should be given credit for having great insight absolutely right also pretty funny but also right Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has admitted they have no evidence of collusion between Trump and Putin or Stalin or Brezhnev or whatever all-star Democrat flack Van Jones admits what that's right that's right the Russia thing is just a big nothing burger even one of the most prominent Democrat messengers in the country admits it's a big nothing burger but that's why corrupt Democrats and their counterparts in the US government bureaucrats so convinced they can run our lives better than we can run them ourselves that they would subvert a free and fair election that's why they needed an insurance policy so now how about the cherry on top what's the cherry on top of the nothing burger or of the nothing burger sundae and mixing metaphors aren't whatever the DOJ has just announced five months worth of text exchanges between struck and page upwards of fifty thousand text messages between December 14th 2016 and May 17th 2017 the day before Muller was appointed special counsel one day before Muller was appointed special counsel those texts have just gone missing first of all for before we get into the meat of this what self-respecting man exchanges 50,000 text messages with his girlfriend i text sweet little elise of once every 10 days at most and then it is only to comment on how delicious whatever lunch she made for me that day is but then sweet little ELISA and I aren't colluding to undo a presidential election so I guess we have a lot less to text about and now the texts are all gone whoops whoops what are the odds what a coincidence that the text messages between two FBI agents who openly boast about trying to sabotage the democratically elected president and overturn the election they all just went missing from the transition period through their appointment of the special counsel whose investigation they both worked on here is how the DOJ explained it they said quote the Department wants to bring to your attention that the FBI's technical system for retaining text messages sent and received on FBI mobile devices failed to preserve text messages for mr. struck and miss page from December 14th to approximately May 17th oops well what can you do what can you do sometimes look sometimes a technical glitch erases five crucial months of evidence central to the most important issue being investigated by a federal agency right isn't that just what happens the devices just didn't sync a new version of what probably just updated it happens by the way by the way none of that explains why the texts aren't still on the devices themselves so they're alleging the messages didn't backup to the cloud or the federal cloud or whatever okay why aren't the message is still on the devices did the FBI sell the phones on Fiverr for 50 bucks a pop or something like that the department wants to bring to your attention that the FBI system of selling old Bureau devices on Craigslist to help pay for the pixel to failed to preserve text messages from mr. struck and miss page got it by the way by the way during the time of the supposed glitch a few important things happened there's just the glitch when all the texts went away just a few things happened in that period Milind mister struck it might have been texting each other about these things the publication of the totally unproven anti-trump fusion gps dossier funded by hillary clinton and the DNC that may have been used as pretext to kick off the whole investigation of Trump and Russia that happened you know Democrats possibly bankrolling a government witch hunt of their political opponents On January 20th also in that time frame Trump was sworn into office on January 24th struck interviewed former trunk advisor Michael Flynn on March 2nd Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigations involving the campaign in Russia on March 4th Trump predicted correctly it turns out that Barack Obama used the government to spy on his campaign on May 9th Trump fired James Comey at the encouragement of virtually every politician in the US on both sides of the aisle and on May 17th Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Muller special counsel to investigate Trump the FBI only lost text messages from those months Fox News asked the FBI on Monday whether they had failed to preserve text message records on similar devices belonging to other officials during that time period because the FBI had blamed the Samsung Galaxy 5 for failing to sync and I will tell you something as the former owner of a Samsung Galaxy 5 phone that is the only credible claim that the FBI has made during this entire ordeal that phone is just a piece of trash half the time it doesn't make phone calls if the GPS feature when you're driving it'll just tell you what you should have done so you're like two blocks after you missed the turn it's a should have turned anyway Fox News asked if the FBI had lost text messages from similar devices belonging to other agents at that time and wouldn't you know the FBI had no comment on the matter so there goes that excuse one has to assume that if the FBI had lost other text messages from similar devices during that time they would have taken out a front page ad in the New York Times to try to slow down the avalanche of corruption allegations but nope no comment so here's the deal I haven't been one of the Republicans or conservatives calling on Trump to fire Muller even though Muller is friends with call me even though Muller appears to have staffed his investigation with anti Trump operatives even though the original rush investigation itself may have been triggered by Democrat money I still urged caution let it play out don't interfere this is a bridge too far the missing text messages is a bridge too far I'm not even impugning Mulder's personal reputation here is personal integrity I don't know if he's a hack or if he's some stand-up guy I don't care this is a bridge too far the FBI the DOJ Bob Muller they don't need to find these text messages I don't even care in the spirit of reconciliation they can just call off the investigation which has been a partisan witch hunt from the beginning and which we're seeing more clearly every day but that's the choice find the text or fire Muller as Hillary Clinton ironically pointed out refusing to accept the results of a presidential election is a direct threat to our democracy we can't tolerate this flagrant threat any longer okay let's get into our panel we have got a good panel today we've got former mayor of Bogota New Jersey and all-around conservative leader Steve lonegan and Vincent beautiful live from Studio 6b but before we talk to them I have to talk about something much more important than any of that our government or our great panel today or another Kingdom I've got to talk about DaVinci DaVinci another sponsor that helps us keep the lights on in Co FFA and

be right back gentlemen thank you for being here Vincent you've been here before Steve lonegan your first time here Steve for those of you who don't know you Steve is this great figure in the conservative movement and the Republican Party former mayor in New Jersey I think did you climb a mountain or something did I read that somewhere yeah I did kill him and you're also a client of DaVinci I use their office space many times your sponsor have you yeah all right we've got a we've got a panel and all over the place yep wonderful yeah that I I think it's a great opportunity I got a broadcast from New York later in the spring and we're certainly gonna be using those guys so okay so we've got a former mayor all-around great conservative activist climbed Kilimanjaro you know just a little thing so you've got a little that's right you know you've got this broad array of experiences from your meanderings around politics and the conservative movement does Trump need to fire Muller is the Russian investigation too tainted with partisan machinations at this point I think the first thing that happens it has to happen is Jeff Sessions Unruh cues himself and the DOJ should take a much more hands-on approach to this investigation because you know these missing eat these missing text message are equivalent to the Watergate tapes in my opinion I think they're gonna be very unveiling the reason there were so many taxes goes obviously they were planning something planning something big you know I have long been loath to criticize the Trump administration I think everything that people freaked out about is nothing it's a nothing burger to quote Van Jones the tweets and the this and that I think that's all fine the one mistake was Jeff Sessions recusing himself I felt that was such a misstep so unnecessary it gave Democrats such unnecessary leverage Vincent what is going to be the outcome of this investigation you're in New York you know that you can indict a ham sandwich is anything going to come from this if it were you or I if it were any individual we'd be in jail by now number one and number two I agree with Steve Jeff Sessions needs to wake up here you know you have Rosenstein who's now you know the second-in-command and handling.this whose hands are all over this you've got mccabe you've got struck you have all these guys KO me and this by the way one of the things that I've been thinking about about this entire controversy is visceral connected the Hillary email campaign and this whole Trump you know Barry Trump thing that we're talking about here with the missing fifty thousand text and all of this stuff they're connected it's a lot of the same people they couldn't they saved Hillary but they couldn't get her elector elected and when they did they tried to bury Trump you know we need Dianne Feinstein now to step in and get a cold to find those 50,000 text messages maybe that's the right thing to do that's absolutely right you know Mike this whole issue that took place between struck and his girlfriend and potentially other FBI agents and substantial people in the FBI which would be unveiled by this text message very well could raise the level of treason if people in the FBI were working actively to undermine the election of the president United States that could very well qualify as the president said as treason so they need to dig in really deep on this this is way bigger than any phony Russian collusion which I think we all know now never took place and and it is crazy there was a formerly very important leader of the conservative movement I like him personally so it won't be too mean to him but he said when President rump was elected he said between the deep state and the Trump State I choose the deep state and that is the worst possible take I can imagine we're talking about the foundations of our Republic we're talking about the right to self-government itself and saying that we can run our own lives in our own country better than some little band of self-appointed elites and bureaucrats in a far distant Capitol and if we see them flexing their muscles and trying to undercut a democratic election presidential election that is a high high crime and you and I don't think you've overstated it and I don't think Trump overstated okay we gotta get to the news shoe is under fire for losing the government shutdown to trump he lost Schumer sellout was trending on Twitter Politico admitted Democrats lost moveon.org called it a bad outrageous deal Pro amnesty activists called it political malpractice de Cave heard round the world now Schumer is insisting that funding for the border wall is off the table Steve this is only a stopgap measure that reopened the government the government is funded through February 8th what happens then it comes roaring back on February 8th and the whole issue of amnesty is going to be on the table of but we're gonna see what people stand because what what Schumer has succeeded in doing is forcing apparently if I'm reading this correctly a simple up or down vote on daca and that's gonna make people take a stand it could be quite a debate and actually I kind of prefer it that way cuz let's get it over with look the people the American people want the wall they want an end to chain migration they want merit-based immigration they want they want to put an end to the visa or lottery system whatever you want to call it this is what the American people want and this is what Donald Trump is pushing for and this is what the Republican Congress and Senate need to deliver if I was in Congress right now I'd be fighting every day to implement just those policies but we're gonna see what happens by February 8 absolutely the vast majority of Americans the vast majority oppose amnesty even for daca even for these people who were brought here at a relatively young age even for the most sympathetic group of illegal aliens they oppose amnesty only 44% of Democrats support amnesty for the daca people for that's of Democrats those are the Pitt is a clear issue it's clear to the American people it's just apparently not clear to squishes and radical Democrats in Congress that's right to limit Lindsey Graham misty as even he admitted he's often called Vincent if Republicans do nothing by February 8th then we don't give amnesty to scores of New Democrat voters and non-essential government services remain closed is that supposed to be a threat is that is that that sounds okay to me what is the incentive to negotiate anything here yeah I mean I hear what you're saying but this is almost a no-win situation because the American people and Trump's entire you know presidency they need immigration reform he needs to get immigration reform Obama couldn't do it with 60 seats and everything that Steve noted those are all the things that the American people want the Redeemer crats however have no incentive to do anything other than obstruct a trump demagogue make him look bad this entire process that is the agenda that's why the government shutdown that's why they're going back on February 8th and it's gonna be a circus again and I think at the end of the day we elected Trump to hold the line and be tough ear and not cave and and I think it's going to be a bit of an impasse and they're nuts and they think that their own base is further left than even that is I'm sorry Steve go ahead there's gonna be a whole lot of swing state Democrats on the ballot and then you'll be looking at what the constituents want and looking at these numbers I think we can get to 60 votes in the Senate to end chain migration to build that wall to end the visa system and to adopt merit-based immigration because of that simple thing called the American election system so those Democrats are gonna have their careers on the line and they know it they know it if I were a Democrat of running it either in Congress running for Congress in a swing state this year I would be terrified of this because the leaders of the Democrat Party they think that their base is left of Lenin they think that their base wants to give amnesty to everybody they don't it isn't true among any demographic of the American people including among Democrats but that's fine let him do it we're gonna run up a bunch of good Republican candidates now we have to move on calculation Michael that's their big miscalculation they are believing in the very very small fringe of their party and I think I think they're gonna get burned mm-hmm speaking of bizarre small fringes we've all heard about the Turpin case that insane couple who starved and tortured their 13 children and shackled them to furniture I think they're out here in my state of California of course glorious little ol California now the media are focusing on one aspect in particular that the terpenes here were homeschooling their children of course they weren't actually schooling them or schooling them in any way at all but according to the government they were homeschooling them so left-wing outlets like the week have written about the sickening danger of homeschooling Steve is this bizarre case evidence that we need more government regulation of homeschooling it's more evidence that the press should be covering the sickening cases of these abortion clinic houses of horrors that have spread of court all across the country that they seem to forget to talk about you know it homeschooling is just a fantastic aspect of our American society I'm a major supporter of homeschooling it's actually sick to tarnish the emission of whole school is because of sick people like this because our society our system police the community whatever failed to know that this was going on under their very noses it is a deeply disturbing thing that took place with this family something that should never happen again but it's certainly not affordable not that the fault of home schoolers and homeschooling should never be blamed for to please of course you know you bring up on that house of horrors a place like Kermit Gosnell the worst mass murderer in American history ran a bloody awful abortion clinic limbs and carcasses and things left all over the place that's right we don't see that practice but the press wouldn't cover it they blacked out the whole thing they wouldn't cover it and then this one bizarre savage torturous couple now they say we need to end homeschooling Vincent at public schools 17,000 cases of student on student sexual assault have been reported in a four year time frame according to a 2004 Department of Education study sex abuse of students in schools across the country is 100 times worse than the widely reported on priests sex abuse scandal of the early 2000s 27 percent of public school kids in the u.s. attend schools that are gang and drug infected according to a 2010 national survey why are the media so quick to gang up on homeschooling because of one depraved couple but they're silent on the sorry state of government schools yeah well that's because the media is clearly just always been in collusion with the left and their government programs but what they seem to jump on and try to claim that government can solve the problems when there's one isolated incident like this terrible story in the turbine house they jump on that and try to make that a national issue like it looked like they need to jump in and do this whole homeschooling government interjection it's ridiculous the this is what's happened with so many issues in this country even daca you can point to on this when they just embrace this and turned it into the whole immigration issue the stuff going on in the schools and government schools and all that type of stuff I have to say if the media will more open-minded to actual journalism and I I I'm I'm I try every day to try and find someone who's because a real journalists out there are these days to report fairly on anything and I'm not saying it and here's this these are just examples of that they're not looking at the real issues that they should be investigating and talking about these stories they're bringing things out that get kind of partisan ish or ideology ish you know and that that that drives me crazy and that can hit drives everybody crazy I'm sure that inflation is so insane I'm sorry go ahead Steve do we have you yes sorry go ahead would you say well they're pushing a left-wing agenda I mean this is a socialist movement it's been percolating under the surface of this country going back for decades and is still out there they've infiltrated the media they've infiltrated Hollywood they've infiltrated our bureaucracy and they continue to push Bush and Bush a left-wing agenda and part of that agenda is to undermine the very core principles of Western civilization and a lot of what you see going here on here is just that to immediately jump on home schooling where parents take charge of their children's line which is a fundamental human right a fundamental responsibility just shows you where they want to go with this country that's right and their kidney always conflate to all of these bizarre things so there's one little crazy family in California is now to be conflated with all of homeschooling just as Vincent pointed out they take the daca people a 25% of whom are illiterate 50% of who don't have a really working Inglot amande of the English language and they say that if you don't support giving immediate amnesty to these illegal aliens then your anti-immigrant or use I don't want immigrants in the country it's ridiculous slights of hand with the language and yeah we should we should hold them to account for that last topic a new CNN poll shows Biden Bernie and Oprah leading Trump in 2020 57 to 40 55 to 42 and fifty one to forty two respectively Steve are these numbers legit do we need to fear President Oprah Winfrey and I I just remember election night and watching all the CNN guys big smiles on their faces go to the end of Donald Trump I remember their faces later that night they were all just it was absolutely hilarious these polls mean absolutely nothing this economy is booming the American people are thrilled with the direction this country is going in you're gonna see Republicans keep the House of Representatives come November and the Senate and maybe even pick up seats and I think that very well could happen if things continue to go the way they're going and you're gonna see a second term for President Donald Trump you also I will predict in the next two years whether what second two years of the first Trump term you need to see another tax cut bill coming into place more cuts and regulations and more economic growth so CNN can continue their pipe dream I believe Michael that they use these polls to try to influence public opinion ahead of time just not going to work absolutely right these polls are just a communication strategy they're just a regular old Democrat tactic no reason to believe them Vincent the combined age of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders is 487 do Democrats have any valuable young talent for 2020 it's it's fairly pathetic right today we're talking about a CNN poll and I agree with everything that Steve said but if the Democrats were smart and I don't want to give them a tip here but if they were smart they'd find a centrist a candidate in the middle that was younger and stronger and pushed them forward because the direction they're going and then the media's ideology you know riding with them shotgun it's not the right direction for the country number one and I think it's the wrong direction for them as a party if they were smart they'd get out of the weeds with with these these retreads here Joe Biden and Bernie I mean seriously Oh I mean I can't even take that seriously I think it's a better chance of finding the 50,000 lost text messages then than believing that survey by the way that entire party needs an overhaul and they need to get to the middle if they want any chance and I don't want to give them that advice maybe we need to edit welcome we'll edit that Adam post alright thank you alright gentlemen that's our whole show we're out of time I'm sorry I could keep you here all day Steve
