PREVENTED.

33
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:55,510
I'VE SAID FOR OVER A YEAR IF WE

35
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,346

51
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,746

00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:39,821
AMOUNT OF CRIMINALS.

56
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:41,123
THEY WILL PUT THEMSELVES IN

57
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:41,623
THAT GROUP.

58
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:44,926
WE KNOW FOR A FACT BASED ON

00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:46,328
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THESE

60
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,262
CARTELS SMUGGLING ORGANIZATIONS

61
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:48,897
WILL PUSH A LARGE GROUP OF

62
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:51,466
FAMILY UNITS IN ONE AREA TO TIE

63
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,435

64
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:55,737
WHILE THE ASSETS ARE TIED UP

65
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:58,440
DEALING WITH FAMILIES THEY PUSH

66
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:00,075

69
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:03,178
THIS IS WHAT FRUSTRATES YOU.

70
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,080
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS KNOW WHAT

71
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:06,114
THE LOOPHOLES ARE AND THEY CAN

72
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:06,848

THAT'S THEIR NUMBER ONE

81
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:19,561
RESPONSIBILITY.

82
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,529
THANK GOD WE HAVE A PRESIDENT

83
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,397

I CANNOT BELIEVE WE'RE EVEN

89
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,474
DISCUSSING THIS IS AN ISSUE AT

90
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:32,908
THIS POINT.

91
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:35,243
>> Sandra: SECRETARY OF STATE

92
00:02:35,244 --> 00:02:37,813

CARAVAN OF INCITING VIOLENCE

94
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:40,615
FOR POLITICAL REASONS AND

95
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:41,883
ISSUED A STATEMENT, A VERY

96
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:43,885
FORMAL ONE SAYING THIS.

97
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:45,620
MANY MIGRANTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO

98
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,889
TRANSIT THESE COUNTRIES AND IN

99
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,225

SOVEREIGNTY, THEIR LAWS AND

101
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:53,128
PROCEDURES.

102
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,097
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP STATED THE

103
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:57,699
U.S. WILL NOT ALLOW ILL LEM

104
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,835
IMMIGRANTS TO ENTER OR STAY IN

105
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:00,535
THE U.S.

106
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:03,105
THEY ARE CONCERNED THEY MAY BE

107
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:04,539
VICTIMIZED BY HUMAN SMUGGLERS

108
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,907
AND OTHERS WHO WOULD EXPLOIT

109
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:07,809
THEM AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE

110
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,510
VIOLENCE PROVOKED BY SOME

111
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:11,046
MEMBERS OF THE GROUP AND

112
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,080
POLITICAL MOTIVATION OF SOME

113
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:14,316
ORGANIZERS OF THE CARAVAN.

114
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,484
IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT.

115
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,185
>> I'M GLAD YOU ASKED IT.

116
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:18,720
THIS IS SOMETHING NOBODY WANTS

117
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:20,422
TO TALK ABOUT ESPECIALLY

118
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:20,922
DEMOCRATS, RIGHT?

119
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:23,024
THEY WANT TO TELL THESE PEOPLE

120
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,926
TO COME THIS THIS COUNTRY.

121
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:26,795
THEY WANT TO OFFER SANCTUARY

122
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:27,662
CITIES AND SUPPORT SANCTUARY

123
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:28,397
CITIES WHERE THEY THINK THEY

124
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:30,532
CAN GO TO A PLACE AND BE

125
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:31,233
PROTECTED FROM ICE.

126
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,101
THEY DON'T WANT TO FUND ICE FOR

127
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,970
THE NUMBER OF BEDS THEY NEED.

128
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:36,505
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH ICE.

129
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:37,906
THIS ENTICES MORE PEOPLE TO

130
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,207
MAKE THIS DANGEROUS JOURNEY.

131
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,842
THEY DON'T COME BY THEMSELVES.

132
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:41,410
THEY HIRE CRIMINAL

133
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,879
ORGANIZATIONS TO GET TO THE

134
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,212
COUNTRY.

135
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:47,182
IN MY 34 YEARS I'VE SEEN

136
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:47,849
NUMEROUS WOMEN RAPED.

137
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,985
CHILDREN DIE MAKING THAT TRIP.

138
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:54,456
I WAS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA WHEN

139
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:56,291
FAMILIES WERE HELD HOSTAGE AND

140
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,492
SMUGGLING FEELS DOUBLED AND

141
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:58,059
TORTURED AND KILLED.

142
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,298
I WAS IN THE BACK OF A TRACTOR

143
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,232
TRAILER FOR PEOPLE WHO

144
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,634
SUFFOCATED TO DEATH.

145
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:06,768
WHEN YOU HAVE WEAK IMMIGRATION

146
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,036
LAWS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

147
00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:10,105
THESE PEOPLE ARE AT THE MERCY

148
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:10,839
OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO

149
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,908
DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM AT ALL.

150
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:13,742
THEY'RE A COMMODITY AND THEY'RE

151
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:14,543
THERE TO MAKE MONEY.

152
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:16,678
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY,

153
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,779
NOT JUST ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT

154
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:19,347
IT'S SAVING LIVES.

155
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:22,317
NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT,

156
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:22,884
ESPECIALLY DEMOCRATS.

157
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,853
WHEN THEY ABOLISH ICE AND TO

158
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,788
THROW OUT SANCTUARY CITIES AND

159
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:28,123
KEEP THEM IN THE UNITED STATES.

160
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:29,791
THEY WANT TO KEEP THEM IN THE

161
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:32,260
UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY BUT

162
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,528
THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD A WALL

163
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:35,297
TO KEEP THEM OUT.

164
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:36,498
MORE PEOPLE WILL BE VICTIMIZED

165
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:37,399
BECAUSE OF IT.

166
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,567
>> Sandra: SOME OF THOSE

167
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:41,136
INVOLVED IN THE CARAVAN IS SAY

168
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:41,736
WHAT THEY'RE FLEEING.

169
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:43,238
THEY CAN'T FIND WORK.

170
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,673
FLEEING VIOLENCE IN SOME CASES.

171
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:46,274
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THIS OUT

172
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,176
IN ONE OF HIS MOST RECENT

173
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:48,510
TWEETS.

174
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,213
EVERY TIME YOU SEE A CARAVAN OR

175
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:51,980
PEOPLE ILLEGALLY COMING OR

176
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,983
ATTEMPTING TO COME INTO OUR

177
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:56,384
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY BLAME THE

178
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,253
DEMOCRATS FOR NOT CHANGING THE

179
00:04:58,254 --> 00:04:59,688
PATHETIC IMMIGRATION LAWS.

180
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:00,922
REMEMBER THE MID-TERMS.

181
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:03,558
SO UNFAIR TO THOSE WHO COME IN

182
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:03,892
LEGALLY.

183
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:05,660
SO TOM, TWO WEEKS OUT FROM

184
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:07,295
MID-TERMS, HOW DOES THIS ALL

185
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:08,230
PLAY OUT?

186
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,365
>> I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

187
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:11,766
ARE PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE

188
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,168
THE PRESIDENT IS 100% RIGHT ON

189
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:13,568
THIS POINT.

190
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:16,438
I'VE BEEN ON THE HILL MANY

191
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:16,738
TIMES.

192
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:19,441
AGAIN, UNTIL THE DEMOCRATS COME

193
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:25,146
TO THE TABLE -- THERE ARE SOME

194
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:26,982
DEMOCRATS LIKE SOME FROM TEXAS

195
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:27,916
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY DON'T

196
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,784
WANT TO GIVE THIS PRESIDENT A

197
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,887
WIN ON IMMIGRATION OR A WIN ON

198
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:33,054
THE BORDER ISSUE.

199
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,923
THIS IS ALL ABOUT PUTTING

200
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:36,091
POLITICAL HATRED OF THIS

201
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:37,092
PRESIDENT AHEAD OF NATIONAL

202
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:39,160
SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY.

203
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:41,062
AHEAD OF THE SAFETY OF THESE

204
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:42,430
AMERICAN PATRIOTS ON THE LINE

205
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,967
THAT WEAR THE UNIFORM IT IS

206
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:46,368
DISGUSTING.

207
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,503
>> Sandra: GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON

208
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:49,004
THE PROGRAM.

209
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:50,038
FORMER DIRECTOR OF ICE

210
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,339
SOMETHING YOU'RE PASSIONATE

211
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,773
ABOUT.

212
00:05:51,774 --> 00:00:00,000
