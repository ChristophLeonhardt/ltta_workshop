if you could enter druthers about how the media treats these sorts of situations obviously you don't I mean we the media does what the media do which is they cover the news when it happens but if you could have had your druthers emotionally just politically in every way what would you what would you have the media do how do you have the media cover these sorts of situations well it's a double-edged sword because on the one hand I was on national news while there were bodies that were still warm and people hadn't been buried yet and that admit that at the time I didn't really think about it but in retrospect it makes me question was that appropriate on the one hand the cameras are gonna leave and I want to make sure the message that I believe is right gets across while the cameras are still there on the other hand people are dead and and I know I don't regret anything I did because I know that what I was doing I did because I believed it was right and that's the best I can do but in regards to how the media covers it I think that the names of shooters should never be released daily wire covers that very well I know that there are multiple pundits as well that do not name the shooters I think that there's a that making the shooters celebrities is flippantly inappropriate I think that I think that I was very often treated like an expert but I'm not I'm not the expert on anything
