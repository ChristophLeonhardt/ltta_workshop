>> IRAN CONTINUED TO PRESERVE
AND EXPAND ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON
FOR FUTURE USES.
WHY WOULD A TERRORIST REGIME
HIDE AND CATALOG SECRET NUCLEAR
FILES IF NOT TO USE THEM AT A
LATER DATE?
PAUL: ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER
NETANYAHU MAKING THE CASE
AGAINST THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL
CLAIMING THAT MORE THAN A
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOCUMENTS
SEIZED PROVED THAT THE AGREEMENT
WAS BASED ON LINES AND TEHRAN IS
SECRETLY MAINTAINING ITS NUCLEAR
WEAPON'S PROGRAMS.
NETANYAHU'S PRESENTATION MONDAY
IN TEL AVIV AHEAD OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S EXPECTED DECISION NEXT
WEEK ON WHETHER THE U.S. WILL
EXIT THE ACCORD.
PRESIDENT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR
DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES AND IT'S
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK HERE, WHAT
DID WE LEARN FROM THAT
PRESENTATION BY THE PRIME
MINISTER THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW
BEFORE?
>> WELL, SOME OF US KNEW AND
SOME OF US DIDN'T, IT'S CLEAR
NOW THAT IRANIAN SPOKESMAN, NOT
LEAST FOREIGN MINISTER HAVE BEEN
LYING AND BEEN ON NUMEROUS NEWS
PROGRAMS AND ON TV SAYING, LOOK,
WE NEVER HAD A NUCLEAR WEAPON'S
PROGRAM, WE DON'T WANT A NUCLEAR
WEAPON'S PROGRAM, SOME WOULD SAY
-- SOMETIMES THEY CLAIM IT WAS
AGAINST IT, AND WE ARE NOT
PLANNING NUCLEAR WEAPON'S
PROGRAM FOR THE FUTURE AND ALL
THAT WAS SIMPLY UNTRUE, THE
IRANIANS HAVE BEEN LIE TO GO OUR
FACES AND THE FACES OF THE
EUROPEANS ALL OF THIS TIME, THEY
HAD THE PLANS READY TO GO.
WE ALSO LEARNED FROM THIS A LOT,
MORE TO BE REVEALED, WE HAVEN'T
TRANSLATED EVERYTHING ABOUT THE
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN NUCLEAR
WEAPON'S PROGRAM, THE SITES
WHERE THIS WORK WAS BEING
CONDUCTED AND THE EQUIPMENT THAT
WAS BEING USED, THIS RAISES A
LOT OF QUESTION THAT THE ATOMIC
AGENCY NEEDS TO PURSUE.
THEY SHOULD SAY, WE HAVE TO
INVESTIGATE AND INSPECT THE
SITES LIKE WE HAVE IN THE PAST,
WE NEED TO INTERVIEW THE
PERSONALITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED
AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE UP TO NOW
AND WE HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THE
EQUIPMENT IS, DISMANTLED, READY
TO BE REINSTALLED.
ALL OF THIS NEEDS TO BE KNOWN.
PAUL: JOHN KERRY AND SOME OF THE
ARCHITECTS OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL,
WE KNEW THEY STORED MOST OF IT
AND WE NEEDED TO DO THE DEAL IN
THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE WE KNEW
IRAN WE WANTED TO PURSUE NUCLEAR
WEAPON, THAT'S WHY WE NEEDED TO
CONTAIN IT WITH THE DEAL, WHAT'S
YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?
>> MY RESPONSE TO THAT IS JOHN
CER RIRY WE CALL THE POSSIBLE
MILITARY DIMENSIONS WOULD BE
REVEALED BY THE IRANIAN REGIME,
THEY DIDN'T, INSTEAD WHAT WE NOW
KNOW IS THAT THEY WERE POSITIVE
MILITARY DIMENSIONS TO ALL THIS.
YOU CANNOT HAVE INTRUSIVE
INSPECTION REGIME AND THAT'S
WHAT KERRY CLAIMS WE HAVE HAD
UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T
SAY, WELL, LET'S GO WHERE YOU
WERE PRODUCING WEAPONS, NUCLEAR
WEAPON'S TRIGGERS AND LET'S SEE
IF YOU'RE DOING THAT OR NOT.
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO INSPECT
ANY MILITARY SITES AS THOUGH
CRAZY IDEA MILITARY SITES WOULD
BE PLACE WHERE MILITARY WEAPONS
WOULD BE PRODUCED.
WE CAN ASK FOR IT AND WE HAVE TO
WAIT SO THEY CAN CLEAN IT UP.
WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS
AGREEMENT NEVER STOPPED IRAN
FROM DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS,
IT MAY, MAY HAVE DELAYED IT IN
SOME RESPECTS BUT THAT'S NOT
EVEN CLEAR.
THE IRANIAN PLAN, WE KNOW, I
THINK, FROM THIS INFORMATION IS
TO GET THEIR ECONOMY BACK IN
SHAPE THROUGH THE LIFTING OF
SANCTIONS AND THEY'VE GOTTEN
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM US AND
THEN AT A TIME OF THEIR CHOOSING
GO AHEAD, DEVELOP NUCLEAR
WEAPONS WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN
THEIR INTENTION EVEN AS THEY'VE
DENIED IT.
PAUL: THE PRESIDENT FACES A BIG
DECISION NEXT WEEK AND HE'S BEEN
NEGOTIATING, HIS ADMINISTRATION
HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH EUROPE
TO GET TO A COMMON GROUND
WHETHER TO REVISE THE DEAL, AT
LEAST AGREE FROM THIS END, THE
WESTERN POWERS TO REVISE THE
DEAL, HOW CLOSE ARE THEY?
ARE THEY MAKING PROGRESS ON AN
AGREEMENT?
>> PROBABLY NOT.
I THINK TWO POSSIBILITIES, ONE
IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL
TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT.
PAUL: RIGHT.
>> FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL
MACRON AND CHANCELLOR ANGELA
MERKEL CAME TO WASHINGTON AND
TRY TO CONVINCE HIM OTHERWISE.
MACRON SAYS I DON'T THINK THAT
WE DID.
THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT HE
DECIDES NOT TO TERMINATE FOR NOW
BUT TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS,
ONE IS TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS
OUTSIDE OF THE NUCLEAR
FRAMEWORK, SANCTIONS ON
TERRORISM, SANCTIONS ON THE
MISSILE PROGRAM AND THESE ARE
MISSILES MEANT TO CARRY NUCLEAR
WEAPONS, BY THE WAY, SANCTIONS
ON A BUNCH OF THINGS, SANCTION
