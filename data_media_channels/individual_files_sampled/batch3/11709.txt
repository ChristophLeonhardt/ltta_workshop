hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle a parting of ways European leaders talk of a future without the u.s. what is in store for the transatlantic alliance and much much more on this edition of crossfire cross knocking some global trends I'm joined by my guests here in Moscow mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Dimitri Bobbitt she's a political analyst with Sputnik International and in Cyprus we cross to Alex Christopher oh he is the director and writer for the duran calm all right gentleman crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want I always appreciate Alex let me go to you first and in Cyprus interesting trend going on we have European leaders speaking out about a future without the United States in terms of the security arrangements specifically NATO and with the impending sanctions visa vie the Iran situation some Europeans are thinking out of the box for a Jains for example we have a president McCrone of France talking about Trump's aggressive isolationism what's your take go ahead no chance that they'll be able to do anything without the United States I think it's all talk my opinion I think that Europe is too intertwined to owned by the United States and to me this is just this is all about Trump you know these these leaders macro and Merkel you're these guys these neoliberals what's been left of the Obama crew so to speak they just don't like Trump they don't like to deal with Trump they don't like his rhetoric and so you know they've got a little bit of Trump derangement syndrome in Europe but I don't think there's any chance in the near to medium term that Europe can do much without the United States I think we saw that with Yonker I think Uecker went to Washington and he's pretty much capitulated to whatever Trump wanted yeah but mark I mean I agree with Alex broadly speaking but there are very specific things like energy where the Germans and the Austrians in the Italians etc are going to go down their own path when it comes to energy security they cannot rely upon an outside power here this is what the brass tacks of it all you know European leaders can say yeah we'll spend more money on NATO but they probably won't okay so they're important rhetorical areas but there are certain policy areas that are very real yeah I agree with Alex I I think that what we're hearing right now is a lot of impotence whining and hand wringing coming from the EU leaders it is personal every other week they're begging the United States to resume the mantle of global military hegemony and the transatlantic leadership as so they don't have to do they don't have but they intend to wait Trump out they think they can wait him out whether it's another year two years however many years they think they can wait him out they're going to continue of course with Nord Stream right the Germans are not going to back down and that project has gone ahead too far and their energy security is risk there is going to be no EU army that's a lot of hot air they can't even sanctions when it comes to North yeah when it sanctions when it comes to Nordstrom is there as yet untested and I I think they do not expect that to be carried through sanctions on EU companies when it comes to Iran that they're having to deal with right now this blocking statue it from 1996 with Cuba that reviving they know very well it will have no effect whatsoever the big European majors total mayors alliance Danielle Steel they're all already pulling out and replace them I could be that we could get Russia China Russia is this really all I mean when we look at how the European leaders are reacting to Trump because I agree with Alex here but really at the center of this I guess is the the the Paris climate Accord and importantly the Iran deal as they see the United States as not a partner that they can trust because they can the US can change its mind it can pull out of internationally agreed treaties in agreement well I agree with Mark italics you know basically there's one point where I agree that you will not do anything serious to help Iran I mean the European Commission has just earmarked 18 million dollars in support of Iranian economy and the State Department in support of small private enterprises huge amount of money right so I don't expect it to be to be of significance on the North stream - I kind of a little disagree I think it will always be under threat because you nipper one of the European companies has already said it would pull out of the project if the United States indeed imposed sanctions on any European companies participated in it in general I think if we take a broader look at a tall basically ultra liberalism is the ideology in the European Union that ideology can make alliances with extremist nationalists they made an alliance with the Nationalists in Ukraine they met & Wine's earlier with the Nationalists in point now they're quarreling with them when the nationalism is directed outwards not yes they're making alliances with nationalists who acted against Russia against China against big countries which are actually not hostile but which the the outer liberal ideology is targeting and they can make an alliance with American nationalists to my mind near conservatives the so-called neo cons they are American nationalists and and basically they you can make an alliance with them against ok let's say with you you know that's mine there was no criticism of the US sanctions against Russia from they you criticism over Iranian sanctions about no criticism of Russia's wrap-up this point here Alex Lee but again we require a broad agreement here I mean doesn't it just end up being empty rhetoric I mean is McCrone just has egg on his face because he can say one thing they can talk about developing a european-wide a swift system but if they don't they don't that's right but if they don't do it where's the credibility where's the credibility Alex yeah I mean I've mocked my own doesn't have much credibility at this point and I think when a EU leaders are talking about moving away from from the US I think you're exactly right Peter I don't think there's much to it and I think an even an even more important point is that inside the EU they can't reach much consensus so while you can have a macaron and/or Merkel saying one thing you have other countries that are opposed to Nordstrom or are opposed to France and Germany's policies within the EU and that also stretches to migration and other issues so the EU just just cannot act as a single unit to muster the strength to move away from the US yeah because they can't even talk among themselves unless I'm mark please put into perspective what is going on surrounding Syria right now because depending on who you listen to be on in and I don't I'm not talking about the mainstream media because I don't talk about it very much but there seems like a lot of rumblings going on right now go ahead okay so we're heading to a major watershed moment a flashpoint in the Syrian conflict which is something we've been talking about the on the show for for well over a year now which is inland this is this province bordering Turkey in the northwest of Syria it's a mountainous area that is entirely under the control of HDS height to her ashram which even the US State Department recognizes is al Qaeda or jihadist groups of various sundry alliances that are always fighting amongst each other under the umbrella of al Qaeda whose suzerainty they've they've all recognized the Syrian army has has finished the fight in the south and they're now moving to retake it live it live is supplied from Turkey turkey basically hoped to turn it Lib into another area of Turkish occupation under its proxy rule it hasn't worked so the Syrian military the Russian forces are marshaling their ready the storm is live and this will be the largest battle of the Syrian conflict so far there are somewhere between 70 and a hundred thousand jihadists under arms a number of people that are close to this situation here FEMA see this as a proxy confrontation because we there are reports that elements of the US Navy are moving closer in to the to the coast of Syria that's the the the Defense Department denies it but at the same time says that they're prepared for anything so I kind of want to have it both ways is this a proxy potential compensation here I think it's it's something worse basically what we can see in the next few days is a false flag chemical attack in Syria which is what the Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Minister of Defense has been crying about it during the last four or five days it got no traction in Europe no traction in the United States Pentagon said that we would strike if we have if if we have a chemical attack a chemical attack may happen but it may come from the rebels and and the white governments are operating activity on that so this is the first danger then it's not only the u.s. ships operating there too big Russian military of their source have crossed the Bosphorus Strait with their supplies the Russian naval verse 15 so there will be more coming and this is becoming more and more dangerous situation but there's also another point that I would like to stress the Russian Foreign Minister raised I think a very important issue there are documents in the UN Security Council which basically forbid the European and American allies to economically help those areas of Syria which are under government control well the voltaire network sites here a document entitled parameters and principles of your assistance drawn by the director of political affairs Jeffrey their particular affairs of United Nations Jeffrey Feltman this is really cruel because when Europe says we didn't destroy Syria Russia destroyed Syria you know I read it in from aliky - I think that Putin wants us to pay for something he destroyed well this is just a lie well that's very Orwellian we can have another Orwellian story in this the second part of the program it's about John John McCain let me go to Alex's finish up he runs on Syria because it does look to me that this is some kind of final attempt by the Western powers to make a statement we still have mattis believe burn of the the the defense secretary talking about a future without Assad I thought we got beyond that point but no they keep going back to that same point go ahead Alex yeah they just they just can't let it go and I agree with with mark and Dimitri and and to the point going back on Europe it's not only the United States that is making claims that they're ready to attack Syria you have France and you have UK jumping on board and saying that if there is a chemical weapons strike something that everyone in alternative media is screaming about from us to Zero Hedge everyone is saying that there is going to be a chemical weapons false flag the mainstream media is not reporting any of it but if there is yeah and if there is the UK and France have also said that they will get involved well they found so we can gentlemen I have to jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on some global trends stay with RT welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter LaBelle to remind you were discussing some global trends alright let me go back to Alex and Cyprus here Alex you and I a few days ago I had a long conversation about what's going on in South Africa and then lo and behold again our conversation was about the the reported murder of white farmers the ex the seizure of land without compensation how the South African government is dealing with it grappling with it politically and internationally and then a number of sources particularly Tucker Carlson over at Fox News talked about it a few other people that well-known youtubers you and I talked about it and lo and behold the South African government seems to be pulling back your thoughts yeah they are taking notice and you noted in our discussion Peter that it's it's the PR part that the South African government is very worried about and president Trump's tweet brought a lot of attention to what's going on in South Africa it's a very complicated issue but what we're seeing now is South Africa trying to explain how the how the land expropriation what other people are calling theft is going to take place and in their comments they're saying that they're not gonna be taking all the land from farmers they are going to leave land that is owned by Zulu tribe members intact and then they're just going to be moving on other land and they're about to take a very big piece of property with the first land seizure from a guy named Johan Steenkamp and the funny thing about his land is that he bought it 20 years ago yeah government right after a part exactly they're not gonna compensate him whatsoever and he said that he will defend he will defend his land and so things are really heating up so much for the rule of law thoughts on this mark it's a complicated issue 72% of farmland in South Africa is owned by whites and they are 9% of the population the land restitution Act was originally enacted to restore land that had been seized from black farmers during the decades long ruled by the apart the US and UK backed apartheid regime it seems there have been some excesses towards that and a lot of it is is hasn't actually happened a lot of it has simply been political rhetoric from within some of the more extremist members of the African National Congress and that is what maybe has been walked back more than anything else Trump has blown this all out of proportion in an attempt to rally his the white nationalist part of his base meanwhile Russia has brunching maybe speaking out for the rule of law mark I think that goes a bit too far but I think well if there's no way but there's so many people that if which law I think exactly and you need to have a conversation about that you can't it's not how did you start marking it's complicated demon well I would like to point some of our attention to the duplicity of the European Union about it because when land seizures were underway in Zimbabwe good point and the EU hated Mugabe there was a lot of noise about it in the media now there is barely anything and and what what is very important talking about human rights violations in Africa David Cameron when he was in power several years ago suggested stop in any economic aid to those African countries which do not recognize single sex marriage which is a cruel decision because a lot of African countries are Muslim and again Africa doesn't have to be on the same standard with the UK you know you can jump 200 300 years but but a Cameron did it he enforced it and now the reason may and I'll give America there at the same time tour in Africa right now and they don't even mention it they just say that they you know the reason may is very proud of allocating 0.7 of their budget for help to the developing countries huge amount of money right and they're only talking about how they love Africa and they don't respond to question the African human was against the ousting of Qaddafi what was it but you did not listen to you know the whole mantra is that you accept Western values and you accept a Western tradition when it comes to a racism being anti-racist the rule of law etc etc it that's the reason why Hema they don't want to talk about it okay because all these issues in South Africa are in play and as Mark said it's complicated well I would say that you have to be a part of a fashionable minority whites in South therefore not a minority but they're not fashionable well they're not victims enough for liberals to care about this is a big topic I'm gonna stay on it Alex I'm gonna go back to you are talking about human rights I'm reading a title from the from the The Washington Post by woman a woman named Jennifer Rubin the human rights community lost a champion who is she talking about oh there's a picture of John McCain your thoughts a picture of John McCain standing next to Olek Janna Bock the neo-nazi leader of Ukraine who formed the social Nationalist Party and then went on to form Swoboda and one is one of the three big leaders of McCain who even the Western mainstream media grudgingly admit okay it's a neo-nazi Alex jumpin picture is worth a thousand words in decades I mean it's it's ridiculous to see everyone piling on left and right from Hillary Clinton to John Lewis to Bernie Sanders Acacio Cortes praising John McCain as as a peacemaker as a man of peace people have people from God in Libya Syria Ukraine Iraq bomb bomb Iran I mean it's it's comical at this point you know it's you know Fatima is John John McCain was an exemplar of American foreign interventions military inventions around the world and the interesting thing is that just about every single intervention John McCain supported ended up in failure in misery but that is you you don't see that in the Washington Post don't see it in the washing poles you see also David Ignatius who is praising McCain for being against climate change and he quotes McCain is saying the worst thing I can do is to sell my soul to the devil I won't do it even for Republican elimination well you know that statement hundreds of thousands of people killed in Vietnam and and McCain never repented for that and he did not sell his soul to the devil now I think there is a very interesting story about that I think we should all thank McCain for not inviting mr. technovic whom mark has just mentioned and who called for attacks against Jews in in Ukraine McCain didn't ask him to carry his coffin but he asked some Vladimir Karim Moussa a prominent liberal anti-putin activist who suggested Putin all the rich businessman living under Putin regime and the sanctions you know in the United States and in Europe he will be carrying McCain's coffin on McCain's personal invitation and I saw there it's like about 20 people you know how can they carry all that I thought al-qaeda would be the pole okay so Azam who Thea the son of Abdullah Azzam bin Laden's mentor had this to say on Twitter he paid tribute to McCain and said that his death is very suspicious coming from considering the Honorable stance he has taken towards the revolution of al-qaeda in Syria his funeral for several months we should know that Donald Trump isn't gonna go there alright I want to change gears I want to talk about North Korea we've heard from media reports that a belligerent letter came from North Korea to the State Department about what motives and and questions the the administration may have about pursuing this peace process here it's a very sketchy media reports and interpreting it seems to be a bit murky as well go ahead Alex yeah the maybe the the letter was interpreted by by Reuters who who kicked it off by calling it belligerent and I was in their title they have since retracted the word belligerent from their title because the the real content came out and it was anything but belligerent basically North Korea was just asking the Trump administration we have three points that we agreed upon what's going on with these three points how are we moving forward and so this was this was a really poor attempt to frame the narrative that North Korea was threatening the United States you know mark it's as if the media and the left don't want a peace process to be put into place and I guess the deep state doesn't want to lose all those contracts that have said for decades pouring money into the Korean Peninsula yeah I think part of this is simply because this is seen as Trump's initiative often even bucking his own administration that and at this point the Democrats have called so far in bed with the neo cons that you can't even tell you're sleeping on which side of the bed at this point but what North Korea asked is certainly we've agreed on three points following the Singapore statement and the Pam Lujan declaration between North Korea and South Korea that we start improving relations we signed a priests treaty finally ending the North Korean War decades later then we start talking about denuclearization of the peninsula the whole Peninsula Peninsula and and you know this is predictable that this is that the Trump administration wants to drop this because you know again I saw this as Trump's initiative that his own his own neocon administration wasn't behind but what's important going forward is how South Korea and moon Langly react to this do they madison's announce that US military drills will recommence on the peninsula in South Korea gonna play along that's what I want to know daemon well that's word I liked how make us Putin she said that the United States ran out of good faith you know and this was a belligerent red letter not even from Kim jong-un from kim bianco the vice chairman of North Korea and that that is belligerent and the US America sorry the u.s. South Korean military exercises every year on the Korean are not belligerent right with hundreds of thousands of troops with most sophisticated weapons tested you know weapons that can destroy puny yarn in several minutes this is not belligerent just a letter from kim hyun cheol's yeah but I think what's really into we're gonna finish on this point you I think what's really interesting what we've said on this program from the very beginning really it's what's at the what's most important here is how the two Koreas engage each other keep your eye on that that's all the time we have many thanks for my guests here in Moscow and in Cyprus this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our youtube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules now for the extended version of our program we have political potpourri Marc you're up to bat okay so dragon bear baby it's on the Bosto vostok 2018 military exercises are the biggest military exercises that Russia has had since 1991 since the Soviet Union it's going to involve some 300,000 Russian troops over a thousand aircraft two fleets the Northern Pacific stock means the east and it is the big annual exercise that takes place in the east there's one it's pre play it's pre-plan pre-plan this year Russia has it for the first time ever to one of these type of exercises has invited China and Mongolia actually to participate and the People's Republic of China the People's Liberation Army is sending some 3,200 troops some 30 aircraft and they'll be participating in this what's the significance of the significance of this first of all the size but this is a clear demonstration to the United States and the the the PLA the People's Liberation Army their official military website made reference to this being directly against the act of hegemonic powers that threaten them in Asia and I think what we really need to look at is there as a potential deterrence value or preparation for conflict in Northeast Asia maybe North Korea if an attack or god forbid an invasion of North Korea took place Russia and China and Mongolia even are showing how they could respond is it showing incredible levels of interoperability between Russia and China this is a long series of military drills this is the largest one so far they've even had joint missile defense I mean throw to you Dima but we would just be is this perceived in a by the US as being provocative or aggressive that's why I asked mark its pre-planned everybody knows I think the market they have observers outside observers the NATO has been invited they have not decided whether they will participate well it's interesting that Michael Kaufman the usual commentator on Russian military forces in the United States he is from the Center for naval analysis he said let me quote the Ministry of Defense of Russia has a tendency to inflate the participant count particularly for exercises in the forest so he accuses us of you know actually having less troops than we promised a year ago during the zappa 2017 exercise it was the East European press that inflated the amount of these exercises to the skies you know all of the Eastern European newspapers were talking about the possible aggression you know a Russian attack under the guise of these exercises later on it turned out to be all I'm sorry baloney but of course no one apologized so I think this is the tactics you know we can never fit you know if we have exercises in the West that is too much we have in the East that is too little we never fit the right standards for the United States and for the East European press but actually I think that Russia's intention is just to show that we have a certain deterrence and Russia is quite open about it that's why you have it's not about militaries but it's just about showing that you have something so that the other guy doesn't detect but Alex will be good I do it's like pretty good it could be worth in completely different ways that China's a threat and Russia's a threat and they're more threatening together okay I mean the mainstream media just has to love these stories here because you don't have to think much go ahead yeah yeah yeah the US is worst nightmare is Russia and China together militarily and so I mean you know they no report this is of course you know Russia being belligerent China getting in on the action being belligerent these two giant anti anti West anti-democracy forces you know having military drills inside of Russia Red Dawn three as long as you got good pictures that's how they get it this is a response to the u.s. national security strategy which way could put a focus on terrorism and other non-state problems around the world and recognize there or this is so many building problems the u.s. the biggest threat u.s. national security is great tower power conflict by which they mean Russia and China Russia and China are once again signaling that they are well aware of this and that they will cooperate and act together in fact they continue to talk in terms of strategic partnership the politicians but on the the PLA this China people liberation official website they even spoke of it in terms of the Chinese Russian alliance it's new that that's new that's new again the politicians are saying something different this is coming tens of military I mean because it's also what's really going on because you could look at that as shorthand you but because the UNITA officially does not join military alliances and Russia doesn't either both countries have avoided what they of the perception of bloc politics but the US with its constant interventions across the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea in the Straits of Taiwan in Ukraine in Syria they've pushed Russia and China closer and closer together thank you for that well I think that we should also think about for that because I'm sure it means uses pivot right yeah the mainstream press is going to say it's all about Trump's tariffs war with China no Obama started it first he created the crisis in Ukraine in 2014 and during that crisis put it went to Beijing and Obama visited all of China's adversaries in the Southeast Asia he visited the Philippines Vietnam Japan and he reassured them all that the United States would support them against China then thank God the Chinese law basically increased the price that they were prepared to pay for the Russian gas and that huge deal four hundred billion for Russian gas to be shipped to China was signed then under Obama thanks to Obama stupidity now it's very interesting Trump that that's a headline in one of the American newspapers Trump is linking the North Korean situation to his deterioration of relations with China well what did he expect from China he has just started a trade war with them which is going to cost billions of those and he expects them to lock him rapidly running out of time of oedema Baba drinks that's a great idea I mean is that it's asking the Chinese leadership to compartmentalize pretty and intensely I would say you have to help it's out in Korea but we want you to pay more okay I mean it's asking a lot at the same time go ahead Alex yeah I mean it's not gonna happen I I think Trump is is going down a very poorly chosen path by linking North Korea yeah with China and going back to Deemas point you know while Obama was playing identity politics you know Russia and China were making deals and they were moving with business as usual and then that's that's the bottom yeah because they know mocking we'll finish it off here on this here is one of the things that I've noticed over particularly the last few months in looking at my liberal mainstream media the world is passing them by rapidly you know we could talk about the Caspian Sea agreement that was more or less sign it's not definitive but there's a general and you're saying significant news for this part of the world here nobody and they don't even know where the Caspian Sea is let alone what kind of agreement was made they're still living back in the world of us unipolar hegemony they don't even want to wake up to the reality of the dawning of a multipolar world the first Cold War was one a large part thanks because this ignition and Kissinger managed to split a People's Republic off from China diplomatically from the Soviet Union they actually had a brief conflict in the 1960s it was kept very quiet now Russia and China are moving ever closer closer together at the time Kissinger told Nixon if your successor is smart in 20 years he'll pivot the other way towards Russia against China that didn't happen Kissinger evidently has been trying to convince Trump to do the same now and that's what some people say Trump is behind Trump's desire to improve relations with Russia but it's far too late the Russian translators expressed the station they know they can't trust the United States or its geopolitical be my last word well it's interesting that Henry Kissinger was called a traitor for that he was called Putin's agent because Moody's agent Jimmy Carter published an article this week in the New York Times about Syria saying that ugly piece is better than more war he was called Putin's agent even for that you know so with this another Henry Kissinger they were at the latest Putin's agent T meetings with this kind of freedom of the press no wonder they can't make deals you wanted to talk about Jimmy Carter's op-ed that he wrote about Syria and in Russia we don't have time to talk about it but I encourage our viewers to look up that article from the former president it's all the time we have for this extended version of our program we hope you enjoyed it and we'll see you next time you
