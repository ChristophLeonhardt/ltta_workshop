I’ve been dreaming about coming
to New York for seven years.
I knew I would be happy walking
the streets of New York.
This will be my first time to see
the Christmas tree at the center.
I love this country
because it offers many services
for people in my condition.
I use audiobooks
for reading books,
and I have a tool
that reads colors.
I was happy to have
made it to the city.
I never felt that
I was a stranger here.
I immediately felt that
I belonged in the city.
Honestly, I’ve considered
New York home
even before I came here.
It’s my place.
I will find myself here.
