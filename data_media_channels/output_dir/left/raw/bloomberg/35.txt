1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,640
Pony Ma is one of the richest people on the planet, though few in the West have heard of him.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,140
He’s the CEO and co-founder of Tencent - China’s internet colossus.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,700
About 1 billion people use Tencent’s two messaging apps, WeChat and QQ for everything -

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,020
texting, shopping, playing games, ordering food, taxis and more.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,840
And that’s just the beginning.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,380
Based in China's Silicon Valley, Shenzhen, it has businesses in a vast range of industries

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,380
like gaming, music, news, video, online publishing and cloud.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,260
Outside China, it has stakes in Tesla and Snapchat, and financed Hollywood blockbusters.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,760
Presiding over a tech empire so huge, Pony Ma is relatively low-key and stays out of the media.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,960
This is how the shy engineer Ma created one of the most influential tech companies in the world.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,360
If we had to compare him with a western equivalent, Ma's probably most like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.

12
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,420
This is Lulu Chen, Bloomberg’s China technology reporter.

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,780
Both were thrust into the spotlight at a relatively young age and have had to adjust their vision,

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,880
personality and skill sets drastically via turmoil and crisis

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,600
at companies that penetrate every aspect of people's lives.

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
But few signs in Ma’s early years suggest that

17
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,620
the teenager with an obsession in astronomy would become a big fish.

18
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,540
So Pony Ma was known as somewhat of a geek among his classmates.

19
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,460
He had a reputation for hacking into university computers and locking the hard drives.

20
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,380
Even the admins weren't able to unlock them.

21
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,380
Ma founded Tencent at the age of 27 with three college classmates and a friend.

22
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,020
For their first product, they cloned an Israeli-made instant messaging service

23
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,000
and adapted it for the Chinese market.

24
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,660
The free QQ messaging service secured 100,000 users by late 1999,

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,400
but it also required more money to keep it going.

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,520
In 2000, Tencent almost went bankrupt but was able to secure $4 million in funding to keep going.

27
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,260
But then came the dot-com bust and money was hard to get.

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,160
So in 2004 Ma decided to list Tencent on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raising $180 million.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,460
To be honest, the IPO wasn't exactly a buzz.

30
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,420
It fell below its issuing price within a month.

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
But Tencent had an even bigger problem.

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,020
It had developed a reputation as the King of knockoffs

33
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,540
and it couldn’t shake off the reputation of being a copycat.

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,340
At one point, its reputation fell so low.

35
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,280
It was embroiled in a full blown media controversy

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,660
and peers openly accused and scolded it for violating copyrights.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,500
The real breakthrough for Tencent came in January 2011 with the birth of WeChat.

38
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,200
WeChat was created in just two months. Timing was key.

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,920
Ma saw the coming of the mobile internet age.

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,440
And WeChat was launched just at the moment when smartphone sales in China took off.

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,420
WeChat now has almost 1 billion monthly active users, three times the entire population of the US.

42
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,740
At first, the service only allowed users to send text messages like WhatsApp.

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Then it added a voice message function

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,840
and then its Moments function, a page resembling Facebook’s News Feed,

45
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,720
and evolved into a social media app.

46
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,880
The most important breakthrough for WeChat came in 2014.

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,040
That year it introduced a feature that allowed users

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,940
to send virtual red envelopes filled with money electronically,

49
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,680
an age-old custom in China during the holidays and at special occasions.

50
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,580
It became a hit. Users quickly started linking their bank accounts with WeChat's wallet.

51
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,340
Now WeChat is a force that even shakes traditional banks and finance institutions.

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,660
You can pay almost everything through WeChat.

53
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,300
It's also one of the main reasons that China's becoming a cashless society.

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,800
WeChat is hailed as a unique Chinese innovation,

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,960
but many dissidents deem it a government's surveillance app

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,520
because it collects a huge amount of data on users.

57
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,140
For the Chinese ruling party, it is both appealing and daunting.

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,540
It opens a window to understanding the psyche of the people they rule like never before.

59
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,840
But they’re also wary of a company like Tencent.

60
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,560
That's why you see constant and regular crackdowns on them.

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,500
Tencent has grown into a tech behemoth with a market capitalization of nearly half a trillion US dollars.

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,080
With the success of WeChat it was able to change from copycat to innovator.

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,920
Pony Ma has stepped out of his shell a lot.

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,880
He's still low-key compared with other Internet founders with flare,

65
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,280
but you can also see him becoming a more vocal leader and strategist.

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,220
Tencent has broken into markets like South East Asia and India, but it hasn’t cracked the Western markets.

67
00:04:58,220 --> 00:00:00,000
Ma’s ambition to become a global player might still be a tough road to take.
