hi I'm Andrew Klavan and this is my new story another Kingdom performed by Michael Knowles in the last episode Austin Lively a failed Hollywood nobody working as a lowly book reader for mythos production company walks through a door and finds himself in a locked room in a castle tower a woman lies stabbed to death on the floor and a bloody dagger is in Austin's hands soldiers break down the door knock Austin senseless and throw him into a dungeon cell with a roaring ogre hungry for blood they leave him there alone another Kingdom Episode two darkness the ogre went on screaming his squealy scream his chains rattling I cowered wild-eyed against the rough wall praying I would wake up because this had to be a dream it had to be the moments went by with intolerable slowness the stench was suffocating so was the helplessness so was the fear but after a while I don't know how long the darkness seemed to have an effect on the monster his roars began to subside the clanking of his chains grew intermittent finally with a last low growl he fell quiet I heard him settling on the floor with a huff my eyes had begun to adjust now the darkness I saw was not utterly dark the torches from the dungeon corridors sent a faint shivering glow through the square opening in the cell door soon I could make out the shape of the monster I could see him sitting against the opposite wall I saw his huge eye blink and then sink slowly shut his great head tilted forward his chin came to rest on his chest he began to snore it was a sound like the bowels of the earth shifting for the first time since I had come here I had a moment of relative quiet relative peace I tried to breathe I tried to calm myself I had to think I had to figure out where I was what I could do I ran my hands over my clothing did I have my phone with me my keys something I could use to call for help or to pry off these manacles but no these weren't my clothes at all not the clothes I'd been wearing when a few minutes ago when I was in the hall at global studios I was wearing some sort of vest suede it felt like and leggings of rough cloth no pockets no pouch nothing I could use to get out of here frustrated I looked around squinting to try and see through the shadows and now with a small shock I realized for the first time that there was someone else here someone besides the monster there was another man sit in the corner to my right he was chained to the wall to I could see the links rising from his nearest wrist to the ring above and behind him the longer I stared the clearer I saw him a starved half-naked creature with long dirty black hair his head hung down his hair dangled obscuring his face I thought he must be asleep like the monster but then as if he felt my eyes on him he looked up looked at me even in that darkness I could see the tears glistening in his eyes and on his cheeks then he lowered his face again his body shuddered I could hear him weeping hey I whispered I glanced at the ogre I didn't want to wake the thing but when the man just went on crying I whispered louder hey the man lifted his head again lifted it slowly as if it were a great weight what is this place I asked him where the hell am I he only stared at me as if he couldn't understand the question I don't know where I am I said tell me please he had to work to speak his voice was hopeless thick with tears he answered as if I ought to already know it's a strim the castle dungeon east room in California are we in California and when he was silent again where is East Room I've never heard of it it's the council seat of Galliano on the border of the 11 lands this sounded so absurd the 11 lands like something out of a second-rate sword-and-sorcery novel I thought at first maybe he was being sarcastic but then this whole place dungeons ogres men with swords it was all sword and sorcery stuff I opened my mouth to ask more but I didn't ask more I didn't say anything I just stood there my mouth still open Galliano isn't that what he said Galliano my mouth closed slowly and licked my lips thinking thinking something had stirred in my memory Galliano I knew that name I'd heard of that place before somewhere where I couldn't remember Galliano I said aloud but now the man lowered his head back down he made an awful noise and began sobbing again where is Galliano I asked him oh please please please was all he said sobbing please I wasn't going to get more out of him not for a while I scanned the cell to see if there was anyone else here no one just the monster still sleeping still snoring and the sobbing man suddenly I was aware how weary I was how heavy I felt as if the weight of all this craziness was just now sinking down on top of me I lowered myself to the floor propped myself against the wall the thick shit stench of the place was even thicker down here it made my Gorge rise and my stomach roll I wanted to stand up out of it but I was too tired exhausted my head continued to pulse with pain I put my hand to the sore spot and flinched I felt dried blood skin scraped raw on a bump the size of a fist I squeezed my eyes shut against the throbbing ache of the wound I leaned my head back against the stone Galliano I thought where had I heard that word before maybe if I could remember I might begin to make some sense of this maybe what seemed like a moment later I quickly lifted my head it had fallen forward I realized I'd been asleep how long I didn't know but something had woken me what was it with a jolt of fear I thought the monster maybe he'd woken up maybe he'd gotten free but I located him in the dark still on the floor curled up on his side now still snoring the emaciated man in the corner to my right also seemed to have fallen asleep what had woken me up then I scanned the dark cell everything was still then wait yes out of the corner of my eye I had seen something for a moment but it was gone now I stared at the spot seconds went by then there it was again a dim colorful flash a strange motley sparkling very brief there and gone I leaned forward peering at the place where the flash had been it took a while but finally I made out of figure a silhouette a shadow there my stomach turned it was some sort of animal something like a rat but huge the size of a small dog it was sitting not two feet away from me just sitting just gazing at me I could see the glint of its eyes my chains rattle Dazz I drew back from the thing but a few seconds later it happened again that dim sparkling multicolored flash of light white red yellow blue green and golden particles of illumination flew off the creature like confetti I gave a little gasp of amazement and discussed in the momentary glow I saw that the rodent had a human face a woman's face bizarre and haunting on that animal body a second later the dancing sparks of light winked out and the rodent or whatever it was dropped back into the shadows again my mouth had gone Stone dry I had to lick my lips before I could speak and should I speak to a thing like that but I did I said what are you what do you want but before she had time to answer if she could answer footsteps sounded on the dungeon stairs I turned quickly toward the door I heard a shout jailer I'm here for the heretic the emaciated man in the corner bolted upright fully awake oh god he screamed he scrambled to his feet his chain clanking the monstrous turd - grumbling I looked toward him then looked toward the girl rodent but she was gone she had vanished there were noises now all around me the jailers door creaking open the emaciated man in the corner mewling to himself no no the ogre chained to the opposite wall snuffed and huffed and lumbered to its feet shit I said footsteps were coming to the cell door torch light coming through the opening the key in the lock the hollow thunk God forgive me help me wailed the emaciated man in the monster the ogre went wild again roaring its high-pitched roar rattling its chains straining to break free frightened I left up I tried to press my body through the stone of the wall behind me to get away from the monster the monster went on shrieking the emaciated man the heretic in the coroner started whimpering he's God he was in an agony of terror the door chunked open the ogre roared louder the heretic cowered and wept the jailer stood just outside the cell doorway holding his torch and into the cell came a figure of fear I knew at once he was an executioner what else could he be dressed in a robe of midnight black his head completely covered by a black mask with holes in it for his mouth and nose and eyes they were eyes that expressed a brisk professionalism jovial contented and merciless I could see the same professionalism in his rolling gait and in his bare blunt powerful cruel white hands here was a man who was happy in his work and good at it he strolled jauntily into the cell and two husky guards strode in behind him the jailer skittered in last his beet nose protruding from his cowl his bug eyes red with flame The Heretic fell to his knees his hands clasped in front of him mercy mercy he cried my eyes flashed here and there in confusion and panic the ogre went on squealing and struggling for the second time I saw dust fly up from the rings that anchored its chains to the wall I thought I saw one of those rings wobble loosening but in the unsteady flame light with all the din and fear I couldn't be sure but I see the heretic cried again the executioner laughed not cruelly I thought but just because the prisoners pleas struck him is amusingly predictable like a child's whining at bedtime you might want to save your screaming heretic he said you'll have plenty to scream about soon enough take him this last was to the guards they moved forward at once and seized hold of the emaciated man he howled and struggled wildly threw himself on the floor clawing the dirt trying to hold on but the guards were skilled and Swift they pushed quickly past his flailing limbs detached his bonds from the wall then holding a length of chain like a leash one of them dragged the prisoner kicking and screaming across the floor and out of the cell the whole operation took less than a minute with the ogre roaring all the while the executioner glanced at me where I stood crouched and gaping against the wall it was a professional glance I thought assessing me as his next project it made my heart go hollow well he said to me then with friendly wave have a pleasant evening and he pivoted back on his heel and strode out as jauntily as he'd come the jailer lingered only another moment to harass the monster with a few last passes of his torch his sadistic giggles were drowned by the ogres frenzied cries stop at you idiot I shouted because this time as the ogre struggled I was certain I saw the ring in the wall start to wiggle out of its moorings the jailer gave another nasty laugh and walked out shutting the door behind him again there was darkness and again the ogre raved and strained and his chains rattled I cowered against the wall waiting for him to break free to leap across the shadows and rip my head off with a single bite of those massive jaws Christ what even see him coming but again slowly he settled down the roaring subsided he sank to the floor once more and began to snore about 20 minutes later the shrieking started I'd heard the expression before my blood ran cold but I never experienced it not like this those shrieks that uncanny sound it was not like any other sound I had ever heard ever it made my breath short it made my balls tighten and yes it made my blood feel icy in my veins somewhere deep in the belly of this nightmare place the heretic was being tortured that jolly professional executioner was doing unimaginable things to him with expert skill I knew this because the victims cries of agony were coming through I don't know how many levels of thick stone and reaching me where I was as loud as if the man were right beside me Jesus Jesus I whispered my flesh was all bumps and tremors it wasn't as if I could feel the pain but I remember the executioner's glance and I could feel my vulnerability to pain how easily what was being done to the heretic could be done to me even the ogre stirred and muttered uneasily in his sleep the shrieking went on and on and on and unbelievably on a kind of torture in itself a mental battering you would have thought the poor bastard would lose his voice you would have thought he would lose consciousness you would have thought he would die just for God's sake die but the executioner must have known every trick every method to make the man suffer and yet keep him alive assaulted by that noise I sank down onto the floor again I curled my body up and pressed my hands to my ears to try to block it out it didn't help at all there was no blocking out those wails of agony they were in my mind now rising out of the blackest part of my imagination on and on and on they shrouded me an acid shroud that ate away at whatever courage I had whatever hope I had whatever faith I had what was happening to me how had I gotten here was I going to die here like this like him tortured executed or ripped to pieces by a beast who couldn't even exist what was this place was I crazy or was that crazy before back in LA was my real life some sort of dream was this hell reality I curled on the floor holding my ears squeezing my eyes shut The Heretic shrieks went on and on and on a tear ran down my cheek and fell into the dust on the dungeon floor what happened next happened with shocking quickness I must have slept again it was a small mercy anyway suddenly the cell door came crashing in suddenly the odor was roaring again suddenly there were men in the cell two guards and that other man the black bearded man in the red vest with the gold dragon the man who had struck me down suddenly the jailer was back with his torch held high and his hideous warty face cracked open in a grim groggy confused I was on my feet the guards came at me and grabbed me freed me from the chains in the wall and wrenched my arms behind me the man and the dragon vest stood directly in front of me his eyes on mine mine held by his he had his sword in his hand and I knew if I struggled he'd strike me down on the spot so I just stood there while the guards manacled my wrists behind my back over the roars of the ogre over the rattling of his chains the man in the dragon vest said in a voice of perfect calm it's time for your trial lively then the guards grabbed my arms the man and the dragon vest strolled out of the cell the guards hustled me after him I was forced across the threshold and the next thing I knew I was standing in the stairwell at global studios the world swirling around me I reeled where I stood the stairwell seemed a tilt and spin I clutched my chests hard-fighting down the urge to vomit I felt myself stagger toward the edge of the steps I reached out blindly for the wooden banister Felton grabbed it held on with both hands to keep from falling over it took me a second or two to catch my breath to get my bearings then my eyes ranged around the space was it possible it was the nightmare the hallucination whatever it had been it was over gripping the banister I bent double I let out a gasp of relief what the actual fuck I said and for a moment I was giddy with joy I laughed out loud but then the moment after that I thought no really what the fuck I lifted my head my vision was blurred with emotion what just happened the only answer I could come up with was that there had to be something wrong with me wrong with my brain a tumor or something because that what just happened that was so insane and so insanely real to the whole thing the dead woman on the floor and the dungeon and the ogre and the shrieking heretic it hadn't been like a dream at all it was like I was there like it was really happening that couldn't be normal could it that was brain tumor stuff for sure still it was over for now at least that was something anyway because so help me that ogre was about to pull those chains out of the wall I was sure of it I laughed again just once Oh grrrrrr I muttered listen to me talking like there were oh girl like there could really be ogres outside of a fairy tale or a movie or something still I couldn't believe how real it had all seemed I started down the stairs I kept a good firm hold on the banister my legs felt weak and unsteady but with every step the dizziness and nausea were receding by the time I reached bottom I could feel the strength returning to my limbs I pushed through the door out onto the ground floor of the Edison building there at the end of the hole where the glass door to the lot outside the Blessed California Sun was shining through them the Blessed Blue California sky was visible above the rounded roofs of the soundstages I made my way to the doors quickly I pushed out and took in a great big beautiful breath of the autumn air how fresh it was how free blowing away the stench of the dungeon the shit and despair erasing the memory of the manacles on my wrist dispersing the suffocating fog of helplessness confusion and terror that had surrounded me I hurried across the lot to my car trying to gather my thoughts trying to make some sense of what had happened I would have to go to the doctor I figured get some tests maybe a brain scan a thing like this it couldn't be normal could it a hallucination that realistic it was caused to worry wasn't it it was I knew it was and yet with every step the entire bizarre experience seemed to be receding into a distant unreality I glanced at my watch it didn't seem as if any time had passed from the moment I stepped into that tower room where the dead woman lay - the moment I returned to the stairwell the whole nightmare had come and gone in an instant so whatever had caused it how bad could it really be by the time my battered Nissan came into view in its parking space I was beginning to talk myself out of even my lingering anxieties maybe this little sword-and-sorcery fantasy of mine had just been some sort of harmless brain glitch some little frizz of neural static I was never a big drug guy but I'd smoked a joint from time to time the last one was more than a year ago but who knows maybe the dope had backed up on me somehow caused a flash of dendritic weirdness a sort of mental belch I continued across the studio lot I saw people stare at me as I went by I saw the way they frowned and narrowed their eyes but I didn't really notice it I didn't notice anything I was too lost in my own thoughts I reached my car I pulled the door open I sank into the driver's seat started the engine glanced up into the rearview mirror to check traffic behind me and I saw myself the shock of it was like a blow to the chest it seemed to stop my heart and knock the breath right out of me I stared at my reflection in the rearview mirror my eyes wide and white and full of horror the side of my face was smeared with dried blood on my forehead was the purple knot with the split skin running across it the wound I had felt with my fingers in the dungeon the wound I had gotten when the man and the dragon vest had struck me with the flat of his sword and knocked me senseless it was there the wound it was real I looked at my hands they were covered in dust there were faint blue bruises around my wrists where the manacles had been I looked up into the mirror again my mouth open the blood the wound they were real it was all real the dead woman the dungeon the ogre roaring in his chains it had really happened as my mind raced I heard a whispered word break from my lips Galliano I drove unsteadily back toward NoHo I was fighting panic now my thoughts were going in circles trying to make sense of something that just did not make sense I kept looking at my reflection in the rearview mirror hoping the wound and the blood would be gone gone like the dungeon and all the rest another hallucination but they were still there always still there and now that I knew they were there my head began to throb and ache again I began to feel weak and dizzy maybe from the blow maybe just from the shock and confusion I parked my jalopy in the garage under my apartment building but I didn't go up to my apartment I didn't want to be alone there staring into the bathroom mirror desperately trying to understand what could not be understood instead I hurried back to Hitchcock's and now I did notice the faces of the people who looked at me the way they started and stared when I staggered past them on the sidewalk all I could think was that they didn't know the half of it for all they knew I could have gotten this wound falling against the curb or walking into a door what if I told them how it had really had and it was quiet at Hitchcock's the hour between breakfast and lunch there was only a handful of stubble shinned writer type sitting behind their laptops at the sidewalk tables I scanned their faces there was no one I knew none of them even looked up from his work as I stumbled past them to the door I pushed inside the cafe I saw it once my usual table was empty all of my friends had gone off to work or whatever it was they did all day there were just a couple of yoga class girls having coffee in one corner that rolled up mats leaning against the wall and out-of-work actor reading a paper back behind the bar a protest of some kind was on the news on TV people shouting raising their fists the volume low it was quiet here very quiet my heart sank no friends no one to turn to no one to help me then Skylar Cohen shot out of the kitchen like a cannonball she looked enormous as always stuffed into her black t-shirt and angry as always with her red hair spiking off her head like a flame she was carrying a plate with a sandwich on it she saw me in the plate dropped from her fingers and shattered on the floor she practically carried me to her car a colourless old Ford of some sort plunked me into the passenger seat and drove me back to her house which was really Jane Jane aways house cursing at me the whole time because she didn't like men but she liked me but she didn't like me because she liked Jane who didn't like her or not in that way and she didn't think it was fair the way men got women to take care of them but something in me brought that out in her which a lot of times actually made me uncomfortable because an annoyed her so much but right at the moment I was very grateful for it was complicated what did you do to yourself you stupid asshole she said glancing from the road to me did you get into some macho ape fight you did didn't you if you did so help me I will fuck you up you understand me you will rue the day Austin I'm serious this from Skylar was tender loving care I leaned against the passenger window weak and sick letting the warmth of her affection wash over me it was a lot of section 20 minutes of insults and obscenities Jane's house was in Los Feliz near Griffith Park a beautiful Spanish colonial manse with yellow walls and a red tiled roof and all sorts of towers and chimneys rising into the branches of the surrounding Oaks the house belonged to Dave axis really her movie star employers it was one of their smaller properties around town they let her live there so they could all the more easily call on her services 24 hours a day seven days a week Skylar parked in the driveway I got out of the car but she rushed around to grab hold of me as if I were about to collapse I can walk I said shut up she explained and she gripped me hard holding me upright as we went together toward the house I was glad she did between the head wound and the insanity of it all I really was pretty sick and dizzy by now I drew strength and comfort from leaning against the generous feminine softness of her she knew it too she pressed me tightly against one enormous breasts though if I had said it out loud she would have beaten me senseless Jane she bellowed as she pushed through the door and hold me in with her between this and being dragged around the dungeons of Galliano by prison guards I felt I hadn't taken two steps on my own all day we came into a hallway hung with colorful Spanish mosaics and paved with elegant Spanish tiles Jane when she wasn't picking up Dave exuses dry-cleaning or shopping for their furniture or driving them from place to place or listening to them complain or helping them pick out their wardrobe Jane was often home during the day working on her computer making their appointments answering their email and arranging their travel I got the impression Dave X has had two lives the glamorous movie star life they lived and the life of everyday drudgery that Jane lived for them she came out of her home office into the front hall and saw me in Skylar's arms a wounded warrior carried off the field she was wearing one of her shapeless sweatshirts and track pants to hide her loveliness from her employers even now when they were nowhere near and yet the look on her face was so full of compassion so full of feminine tenderness Skylar felt but couldn't show that it pierced through even my panic and confusion and I saw that mousy Jane was really beautiful for the first time I wondered down deep only just above the level of panicking consciousness what would it be like to actually earn the kind of devotion that her movie star bosses merely paid for the two girls helped me into what I guess was a guest room a small rectangular space with nothing but a single bed and a writing desk and share in it plus a window onto a pleasantly weedy little garden out back Jane took my shoes off while Skylar lay me down on the mattress my head on a fluffy pillow then Skylar fetched a washcloth and brought it to Jane Jane sat beside me and cleaned my wound fussing over me with a womanly care that made me yearn up into her blue green eyes Skylar meanwhile leaned darkly against the door looking jealous of me for being with Jane and jealous of Jane for being the Jane like way Skylar could never bring herself to be what did you do to yourself sweetheart Jane asked me swabbing the wound he got into a fight said Skylar gruffly from the doorway I didn't get in a fight I said what did you do asked Jane what could I say that I'd been bodily swept off into some fantasy movie locked in a castle dungeon with an ogre and the imaginary land of Galliano I tripped and fell off the curb at the studio smacked my head on the pavement I said Oh Austen I didn't like lying to her but I liked the pity in her voice I loved the pity I drank the pity down like a healing elixir how soft they were those blue-green eyes she wrung the washcloth out in a small bowl she examined her work my head the cuts not so bad I don't think you need stitches or anything it's just a bad bump really and so help me as I live she leaned down and kissed it lightly to make it better you know and so help me as I live it did make it better it made me feel better anyway she was full of magic in our Jane and all I could think was what a shame it was what a waste to spend that supernatural girl power on a couple of movie stars who wouldn't even notice if their limo backed over her a man of spirit on the other hand might live and die to make her proud and happy from the corner of my eye I saw Skylar avert her glance from the two of us wincing with emotional pain then I heard we all heard the phone ringing in the home office Dave exes calling Jane with one of their endless demands and yet she didn't leave me not right away I want you to rest here a little alright until you feel stronger the phone rang again she stood up off the bed are you hungry do you need something to eat I shook my head weakly gazing up at her mesmerised alright I'll make you some soup in a while just get some rest she lingered to smile down at me but the phone kept insisting at last she hurried away I glanced over it's Skyler Skyler rolled her eyes and shook her head and discussed then peeled off the doorway and disappeared down the hall alone then I lay where I was Jane had worked her wonders on me everything that had been frantic inside me was quiet now everything that had been sore was soothed and easy I turned my head on the pillow to glance out the window at the pale green tangle of garden framed in the pain for the first time since my return to reality or my return to Los Angeles at least which was as close to reality as I was going to get I was able to think things over with a measure of calm what had happened to me this journey to Galliano what was it if it was just a hallucination how had it left its mark on me I didn't just mean the bruise on my head either it was more than that the shock of my arrest the fear of the ogre the sympathetic agony that had curdled my skin as I listened to the shrieks of the tortured heretic all that had scarred me too if nothing else I couldn't help but notice it had taken me out of myself a little given me some emotional distance from my current Hollywood setbacks and irritations in fact I hardly felt them at all anymore even if Galliano was an illusion that mark remained same as the knot on my forehead Galliano where had I heard that name before gentle by Jane's gentleness I let my eyes sink shut I woke from a fine deep sleep still peaceful more peaceful than I had felt in what seemed like a long time I had been so troubled for such a while these many weeks at least the long quietly frantic wait to hear back from my agent about my new script the hollow nausea of knowing the script was bad the crushing grief that's what it was the grief of having him reject me the spiraling emptiness of feeling that the dream of my life was over that I was not going to be what I wanted to be but was going to be nothing more than what I was right now and then walking through that stairwell door Galliano where had I heard that name I went into the pocket of my jeans and fished out my phone still lying down I held it up above me working the keyboard with my thumbs I brought up the og search engine and tapped in the word Galliano there were over a million hits it was both a first name and a last name in the name of several locations up at the top of the results there was a Wikipedia entry I clicked on that it was a disambiguation page a page giving all the various listings for the word Galliano may refer to a town in Punjab Pakistan a princess in Moorish Spain a fictional country in the novel another Kingdom by Ellen ever more the moment I've reached the end of the entry I felt a jolt of recognition another Kingdom I whispered to myself yes I knew that book or at least I've heard of it but when where I read so many books as a story analyst for mythos I couldn't remember all of them yet I felt sure I'd that title somewhere among them there was no link to any Wikipedia entry for the book so I called up Amazon and searched for it there sure enough they had it listed another Kingdom by Ella Nevermore murder and political intrigue stalked the dangerous halls of castle e strim in the New Republic of galliano there it was excited i sat up quickly too quickly the room tilted and I felt dizzy and sick again war I said slowly I lay back down I reread the page East Room in Galliano wasn't that exactly what the heretic had told me in the dungeon yes it was I scrolled over the site some more but surprisingly there was nothing else to find there should have been a longer description of the book but there wasn't there should have been a picture of the book's cover but there was only an empty square containing the words no image there were no reviews no links to other sellers only a notice that said this book is not available at this time not available anywhere on the whole internet not available at all moving cautiously I turned onto my side and propped myself up on my elbow to get in a better position to work the phone I searched other sites auction sites use book sites I ran a general search for the novel's title it led me back to Amazon that was it I bit the corner of my lip strange no a book you couldn't find online when the hell does that happen I took a breath trying to come up with a fresh search tactic and I thought my coverage sure if I'd read the book for mythos I would have written a report I tried my eReader but there was nothing there which didn't mean much to preserve space I usually moved coverage I no longer needed into a local file in my laptop I needed to get home and look for that coverage my hunting blood was up now something weird had happened to me something very weird mega weird the hallucination or dream or whatever it was the head wound and now a novel with the place-names Galliano in Easter a minute just like in the dream it felt like I was close to finding an explanation for my experience close and yet impossibly far because I couldn't imagine what explanation there could be but whatever it was I wanted to find out needed to another Kingdom by Ella Nevermore I needed to get home and find that coverage this has been another Kingdom by Andrew Klavan performed by Michael laws
