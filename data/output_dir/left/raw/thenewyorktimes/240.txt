00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,960
Hi I‘m Fox San Antonio’s
Jessica Headly

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,270
and I’m Ryan Wolf, our greatest responsibility ...

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,480
The news site Deadspin

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,570
recently produced a mash
up video that went viral

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,830
and unsettled many Americans.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,990
It exposed how America’s
largest broadcaster forced

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,390
its local anchors
to read an Orwellian script.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,040
The Sinclair
Broadcasting Group

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,100
demanded its local anchors
recite the same lines

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,940
demonizing media and sowing
distrust with warnings like this:

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,780
What’s worse, if you actually
watch Sinclair’s programming,

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,340
you’ll see they violate almost
everything they warn against.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,580
So far no hearings on
the big uranium deal.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,360
That’s right.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,690
That’s a Sinclair host promoting
the debunked conspiracy

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,650
theory that Hillary Clinton gave
away 20% of America’s uranium to Russia.

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,870
It could
involve kickbacks

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,760
to the Clinton Foundation.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,640
Oh, and here’s another segment
alluding to the baseless

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,280
conspiracy theory that
a Democratic staffer was

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,100
murdered for leaking
party emails to WikiLeaks.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,070
There’s a theory Democratic
National Committee e-mails were

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,640
given to Wikileaks by a DNC
whistleblower who was later

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,660
gunned down.

25
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,870
Maybe it was him. Maybe
it was the Russians.

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,650
And what about this warning:

27
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,630
Personal bias?

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,380
Well, Sinclair actually has
an entire syndicated segment

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,600
that does...exactly that.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,660
The host is a former
Trump media adviser.

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,550
Local Sinclair
stations are forced

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,610
to broadcast his pieces
multiple times a week.

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,400
Predictably, they almost
always defend Trump.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,950
Facts show that
our country is fine

35
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,140
and it is heading in
the right direction.

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,031
And this third
warning from Sinclair:

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,010
Sinclair even
dedicated a segment

38
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,090
to the existence of a secretive
deep state, void of any evidence.

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,980
It‘s a term President
Trump tweeted about

40
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,210
earlier this year.

41
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,300
The main source:

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,320
another former Trump
adviser, Sebastian Gorka.

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,540
Talking at the highest
levels of US government.

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,510
The main facts: a
public opinion poll.

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,300
The only skepticism offered
in the two-minute piece

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,780
were these six seconds.

47
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,800
Some critics call the deep
state a conspiracy theory

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,970
peddled by Republicans
hoping to undermine the FBI.

49
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,210
Clearly Sinclair doesn’t
practice what they preach.

50
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,670
Large corporations
with partisan agendas

51
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,470
should not be broadcasting into 
72% of American households,

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,060
under the guide of local news.

53
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,970
That’s why federal regulators
must stop Sinclair’s purchase

54
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,350
of Tribune Media.

55
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,060
Pay attention to the story here,

56
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,470
and maybe at Fox,

57
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,610
and maybe on Breitbart.

58
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,620
And maybe in the US Senate.

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:00:00,000
But you won’t hear it anywhere else, 
so, you know where to look.
