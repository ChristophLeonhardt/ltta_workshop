we're gonna start with the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe and president Trump now raising doubts about whether McCabe kept personal notes about their Oval Office meetings to people familiar with the case tell the Washington Post that McCabe memorialized his interactions with the president in memos which if true could become key pieces of evidence in Robert Miller's Russia probe on Sunday morning the president lashed out at the report tweeting spend very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date same with lying James Comey can we call them fake memos hours later a lawyer for Andrew McCabe tweeted we will not be responding to each childish defamatory disgusting and false tweet by the president the whole truth will come out in due course but the tweets confirm that he has corrupted the entire process that led to mr. McCabe's termination and has rendered it illegitimate Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced McCabe's firing around 10:00 p.m. on Friday night that's 24 hours before he was set to retire according to Axios McCabe was informed of his dismissal just nine minutes before the news was released to the media before his firing McCabe told POLITICO that his work on the FBI's Russia probe is what sparked a smear campaign against him he said quote I firmly believe that this is an ongoing effort to undermine my credibility because of the work that I did on the Russia case because of the investigation that I oversaw an impacted that targets this infer in administration he went on to say that they have every reason to believe that I could end up being a significant witness and whatever the special counsel comes up with and so they are trying to create this counter narrative that I am NOT someone who can be believed or trusted there's so much to get to hear and so many other stories that play into this but first David Ignatius is drunk at a fire Muller he certainly made noises as if he's getting ready to do that he's setting the table for it it does fit the pad pattern III think that one thing we saw this weekend was certainly Trump pushing against the limits of this cage he feels himself in but Republicans speaking out on the hill surprisingly forcefully Lindsey Graham mm-hmm Speaker of the House Ryan chris Christie even saying that any attempt to fire Muller would be a serious mistake would bring on a crisis implying that those Republicans at least would not support the president so at the end of this weekend I think the likelihood that he'll fire Muller maybe a little less than it appeared to be when it started with these players in this investigation covering this feel like attacking us personally the way the president has acted over the weekend is a step toward firing Muller you talk about Republicans who are pushing back Paul Ryan didn't even put his face in this voice on it he did this through his folks first did but but still there's something on the record from Ryan the what we've seen from the house is a series of capitulation that to Trump certainly from the House Intelligence Committee Devon yes step by step has been Trump's kind of you know floor leader on the house I thought Ryan stepped away from that yes it was in the name of his smokes but not him but if I was sitting in the White House I'd take this as a warning and I thought the way that's the way it drops lawyer John Dowd to it right I got by the end of the weekend dad was pulling back and say no no I didn't mean to say that I we want to fire that statement out late last night as well gonna jump to gentlemen in just a second but first are we gonna hear from more Republicans on this it's the usual suspects except for Paul Ryan dipping his toe into it through a spokesperson what can we get more from Robo Big Joe seriously I mean look the person I'm waiting to hear from is Mitch McConnell there was a difference between how Ryan and McConnell handled this over the weekend McConnell has been straight-up silent whereas I do think David's point is well-taken about the House Speaker and I think his the speaker's office and the speaker himself have I think to a certain extent been and you know this is on them but they a little bit surprised by how aggressively political everything around Devin Nunez was how quickly that all came to a head and I think there are some there are some in his office who would say they probably should have handled that differently and so you know I think when it comes to Muller they want to make sure that they do handle it the right way and if this was in fact maybe perhaps part of the president's attempts to negotiate in public with Muller for the terms of his interview you know or whether it was a trial balloon to try to see whether Republicans were gonna be willing to still defend Muller because that could be you know an open question I mean you had Republicans backing legislation to try to protect him they were vocal about it they had stepped back this was a test for the president to say hey maybe maybe I could do this the answer seems to be no all right John Hammond the president's tweets especially about McCabe overtime and then his actions over the weekend what do they tell you well certainly that take I agree with everything that David said everything in case I said in the sense that there's there seemed to be movement over the weekend in the sense that that the Trump tweets were extraordinary the first time he's mentioned Muller ever on Twitter he went pretty far out there dad went pretty far out there by the end of the weekend they seem to be pulling back a little bit but the question I want to ask Matt Apuzzo and I think there's just a lot to still discuss here one interesting thing from the weekend was the fact that the majority of the minority cab that had chief authority a member on the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff went in the opposite direction from the rest of the Democratic Party which reacted in a kind of typical way and said hey it's possible that any McCabe's firing was justified we would need to know more about that so there's a big fact hanging out there a set of facts hanging out that it's actually gonna be in the Justice Department inspector general's report so first of all a map when are we gonna see that report and secondly is there not an interpretation to all of this that this was Trump trying to create a kind of litmus test for Jeff Sessions and sessions making this decision in some ways preserved his job and did not give Trump a easy pretext for firing sessions yeah and the report you're referring to obviously is this long-awaited Inspector General's report we know there is one specifically on Andrew McCabe obviously the IG has been investigating a whole range of issues related to the FBI's activities during the 2016 campaign you know we hope we're gonna see the McCabe reports soon because frankly to your point just shifts point the accusations the allegations that the Attorney General has lobbed here are are incredibly serious this lack of candor is basically the kiss of death at the FBI the FBI can excuse a lot of things you can lose your gun you can drive drunk you beat your spouse and you know you'll be disciplined but you could keep your job lack of candor just be there's no coming back from that so I really want to see this reporter be able to judge well what exactly was said did he flat-out lie you know I spoke with McCabe and and he is adamant you know he was did not mislead anybody that that he did not lie he was not that he he wasn't he did show candor and that this is all an effort to discredit him and frankly I mean the president's tweets over the weekend and and John Dowd statements you know play right into that argument because there were career officials at the FBI and just Department involved in this process and the DOJ would very much like to remind the public that this is a real process not a politicized one but the president by every time he opens his mouth on Twitter and brings up Andrew McCabe and taunts him or goads him or talks about his wife or his pension it just adds to McCain's offense that this is all about this is all about Muller this is all about trying to discredit me right so Matt let me stay with you on this and come back to my question about sessions there are a couple different questions I'll unpack my initial first cut abyss and just sort of say first of all there's obviously a theory out there that sessions was given a litmus test here by Trump and there's it's a sort of a conspiracy theory in some ways but the notion that sessions kind of by by firing by agreeing to fire mccabe preserve his own position but embedded within that question there's another question that I'd like you to address which is the question of how it is that sessions could make this decision at all given that he is supposedly recused from anything that touches on the Russia investigation which mccabe as he rightly points out could end up being a witness in in a variety of different potential forums going forward depending on what Muller does right I mean that's a good question I think I think that the four corners of the McCabe issue if you read it narrowly doesn't touch on Russia right I mean ultimately this is about whether he was honest with internal investigators that was related to a twenty sixteen article in the wash The Wall Street Journal that was related to Hillary Clinton so it wasn't related to Trump and so a narrow reading of this would suggest that this doesn't have anything to do with Russia and this wouldn't cover my god the Attorney General for coucil but of course if you just pulled back the lens a little bit it becomes really hard to separate Andrew McCabe in Russia I mean he was there from day one when the Australians come to the FBI and say we have information about George papadopolis the Trump campaign advisor that he has potentially inside information about Russian hockey Andrew McCabe is there right very hard to separate those two right and that is not me he's already saying he's got the notion that he has these notes from his interactions with Trump around the firing of Comey puts him right in the middle of the obstruction of justice question so it's kind of it's a this is all balled up together it's hard to make a clean case that that sessions that this is wholly apart from what the special prosecutor is doing or from the Russia investigation given that McCabe touches almost everything that has to do with the Justice Department and these relevant matters absolutely and the president doesn't make it any easier on Jeff Sessions to to try to stake out that you know this was all fair and balanced and impartial by the fact that he's publicly needled the Attorney General to do why hasn't he fired Jeff Sessions I mean why excuse me the president's tweeted why hasn't he replaced Andrew McCabe you know and McCabe would say look this is evidence that there is a war going on between the president United States and the FBI and Bob Muller and Andrew McCabe is in the middle of it until we see this report we can't really judge for ourselves what the underlying facts are thanks for checking out MSNBC on
