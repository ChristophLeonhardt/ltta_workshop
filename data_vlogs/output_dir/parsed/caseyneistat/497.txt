bit more do you think all those people
are here to open the door for me all
right
am I in the right side
thanks a lot I'll see you later thanks
for the lads excitement who I dunno they
told me like a hundred times to get here
early I feel like maybe I got here a
little too early I'm the only one at the
Oscars right now things haven't kicked
off yet on the red carpet so we're just
walking through checking things out
but if this is what it looks like before
it starts I can only imagine what it
looks like after it starts look at this
food
Daniel snacks I was assigned a
babysitter today like someone to keep an
eye on me and he was told never to leave
his presence there lost
I lost the baby can I see what's over
here and then I'll probably just come
back I've got this great pass here which
basically means Casey goes everywhere
this is where everybody takes the
pictures this is where you're supposed
to stand it told me not to come back
here so I thought I might interrupt some
photo shoots like these yeah yes we're
not allowed to have any wireless devices
of any kind on department
my ticket all right this is it goodbye
Oscars red carpet it's been a really fun
time into the theater now
situation here is like social
there's a lot of like potato chips
nobody cares about that but there's also
pizza
it's like the Oscars of Dietzen
which I think adds up to life almost
Emile also
I'm hitting this off
headed to our seats now
okay this is the big moment now I'm
going to see my seat I hate to see the
seat that the Academy thought that I was
worthy of can't wait it's the other way
okay this is the seat that the Academy
of Motion Pictures thought that I
deserved so up again okay yeah this is
where they taught here oh come on these
seats are bad imagine being this guy
that's it right there is Leonardo
DiCaprio see he's not honestly he was in
the seat for like ten minutes at the
beginning of the show and he's been gone
ever since
I left the theater is getting boring in
there there they go on a little bit of
like a trouble finding mission suit I
can dig up
okay this shows happening right now is
live broadcast is happening now these
for some reason give us backstage act
did you see all those Oscars my favorite
celebrity of the evening is right here
during the broadcast
all right I feel like one of the West
we've gone places that we should not
have gone to like where the winners go
it's been fun but I feel a little bit
like an interloper I don't belong here
so I'm gonna get out of here now go back
to my seat I'll get my little freaked
out this is the stage behind me I mean
it's been fun but I'm gonna get
outstanding nominees
in order
let us not take this planet for granted
I do not take tonight
Oscar's are over they could bring me
some some PD and projections
