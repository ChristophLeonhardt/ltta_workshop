so I just made it to the area intended for the media very close to where Donald Trump will meet he's out of our pool and I see this so the hosts are setting the rules straight and security precaution very soon we'll find out whether the arrows can be pointing in the same direction when the president's meet so the head-to-head meeting lasted two times longer than originally expected and we were only allowed to film the first 40 seconds she was only Donald Trump who said there was a good start to the summit there's something else I pointed out for myself the microphones for both theaters are different for some reason the one for Donald Trump looks to be much bigger and a bit more complicated first a question for mr. Trump in English mr. president would you please go into the details of possibly any specific arrangements for the u.s. to work together with Russia in Syria if any of these kind of arrangements were made today or discussed one little thing I might add to that is the helping of people helping of people because you have such horrible if you see and I've seen reports and I've seen pictures I've seen just about everything and if we can do something to help the people of Syria get back into some form of shelter and on a humanitarian basis and that's what the word was really a humanitarian basis I think that both of us would be very interested in doing that and we are we will do that soon it will be two years since Donald Trump was elected but guess what still worries the entire u.s. presidential press poll allegations of meddling and collusion they were sitting right here and almost all the questions from this part of the room were about that and it was rather fascinating to see how the two leaders almost teamed up to dodge these kind of questions however none of this seemed to convince American journalists and while I was looking at them when they were leaving the room they seemed to be even more frustrated than before the leaders met Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin though when they were heading towards the doors I could only see smiles on their faces you
