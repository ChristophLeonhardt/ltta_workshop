welcome to surrounds arena like so many
of the other stadiums this is purposely
built for the World Cup
poor games team play here and the first
of those has a personal interest to me
because that will feature my son playing
on this pitch
but then MA against Peru
dressing-room team being that will be
dynamic special
the last time I was in a dresser with
the player about 200 years ago it
certainly didn't look like this it's
absolutely fantastic and I think in this
seat
the goalkeepers for whatever team is
playing here will be sad
and since Denmark and my son playing the
first game and uses this professional I
think this will be cast a scene
I think emotionally when Denmark plays
I've got the feeling of Denmark playing
obviously but also with my son in there
it's gonna be more emotional than than
maybe any other game that he plays this
is the World Cup the World Cup is
massive and to have a son playing in
that yeah I'm very proud
what else is going on around here I'm
Peter Schmeichel and I'm here to find
out I'm in the museum in saransk and
there's a permanent exhibition by a
fella called Stefan Aryan at least I
think that's how you pronounce it he is
an extraordinary artist the centerpiece
of the whole exhibition is this it's
called Moses it's made from one large
piece of wood in might've must have been
some tree but it's fantastic
it is and so uh so many other of his
pieces in here it looks a little bit
like the very famous Rinaldo but let me
just see if I can find a picture of him
you know coming over from this angle it
it looks more like Luis and Carla
and from over here it from here
it's a spitting image of loofah fan
challah and let me just see when it was
made it was made in 1962 so maybe fan
how did model for this I really got
inspired by being in the museum so I
phoned up a local artist called URI
theorem just to see if I could use his
art gallery and as you can see he's
quite a competent artist himself with
exhibitions basically everywhere in the
world you were nice to me thank you very
much I really want to see if I can paint
so do you mind if I if I use your your
pencils and colors and yes I'm not sure
what's gonna end up on the canvas but I
will attempt to to paint a face and it's
painted going up we didn't have that
Ivan's my school but I always enjoyed
join I really like a guy an American guy
his name is just my condo hurry enjoy
his work but then of course my favors
like everybody else's favors of the
Picasso's as it was a sigh thank you sir
it's a little bit too dark I'm scared of
him
I'm just gonna say it's not my best
piece but then sin is my only piece it
is my best piece and this is how it
looks
I'm just about to go on stage now and
speak to the defense of surrounds this
is special for me because this is where
then my play the first game and
hopefully this guy will support that I
have been travelling around Russia we
seen all the host cities and this one is
the one that I have been looking forward
to this is where the World Cup starts
for me emotionally and since I came out
to visit you today I expect that all of
you will from now on support Denmark
oh good shot
just go
how did you manage to scores they don't
looking for first time that you did it
impress dissipate yeah Brad
