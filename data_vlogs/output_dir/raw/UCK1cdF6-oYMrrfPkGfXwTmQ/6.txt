00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
What's up guys, Violet here back at it again

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,860
So you might be wondering

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,320
Why are you in your old house

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,020
Well I'll tell ya

5
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,680
As you guys know I've been working on a sunglass collaboration with Quay Australia

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,740
and I'm so excited to finally share with you guys

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,700
all my new styles, all my colors of all my sunglasses

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,020
it officially dropped today

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,500
so if you didn't buy them already please go buy some

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,860
I'm not gonna like force you to

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,440
but if you want to it's up to you

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,640
oooooo

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,540
I'm just going to show you guys all my new styles

14
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,880
and yeah lets just get right into it

15
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,000
so these ones are called clout

16
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,040
obviously I named them after me and my friends just kidding

17
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,400
and clout hits home hard for me because just you know

18
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,300
Clout Gang and they go with everything

19
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,320
I think these ones are my favorite ones just because

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,740
I wear them with everything and their just simple

21
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,600
tiny round sunglasses

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,070
And their really easy

23
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,320
So these ones are called finesse and just like the clout

24
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
we have the black, red, and violet

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,360
These ones I named finesse just because

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
I feel like I'm a finesser

27
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,380
I finesse my way through life and now I'm here

28
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,380
and I feel like everyones like a little bit of a finesser

29
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,980
in their life

30
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,440
You can relate

31
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,120
The violet ones, I couldn't just name them purple

32
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,120
because that's not I'm Alissa Violet

33
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,800
obviously I have to name them violet duh

34
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,260
These ones are just cool edgy their just their a finesse

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,240
You can put them up here

36
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,700
you can put them down here

37
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:16,940
You could do whatever

38
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,620
These ones are called BO$$ with money signs

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,980
Because

40
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,660
As you can see I have a tattoo thats says boss with money signs

41
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,740
So obviously I had to incorporate this in my sunglass collection

42
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,960
Because I'm a boss

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,240
with money signs

44
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,520
I love how these have the little gold on the sides

45
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,500
cause it goes with all my jewelry and

46
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,300
Im just wearing a lot of gold now a days

47
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,640
So these ones are called hindsight

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
and I think their my other favorites just because

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,360
their so big and they block out the haters

50
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,200
I like to wear these when I go to the airport when I go to the mall

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,560
These are almost like an everyday sunglasses for me too

52
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,940
they just they look so

53
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,840
unbothered and leave me alone I'm too good

54
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,280
Their just like their dope sunglass

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,240
ses

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,140
uh

57
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,960
Their big and blocky and they remind me of like

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
lady gaga, like pop star vibe, like a diva

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
Which is me

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,580
and then we have them in gold and then black and pink

61
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,600
and their just... amazing

62
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,280
