I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR YOU
GUYS.
HENCE THE BUGLE.
WE ARE STARTING TYT
INVESTIGATES.
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN I'M INTROING
A SEGMENT ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING
TO DO OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM.
DO NOT WORRY, I'M NOT THE ONE
DOING IT.
REMEMBER GUYS, WE RAISED TWO
MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE
AUDIENCE, FROM YOU GUYS AND TO
DO MORE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING.
WELL, THOSE FOLKS WERE UNDER TYT
POLITICS.
WE GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.
WE'RE DOING TO CHANNELS FOR THE
PRICE OF ONE NOW.
TYT POLITICS WILL REMAIN AS
IT IS AND IT WILL COVER
PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES, CAUSES,
PROTESTS, RALLIES, JUST
LIKE IT'S ALWAYS DONE, AND
THE NEW CHANNEL NOW THAT IS
STARTING CALLED TYT
INVESTIGATES, AND THAT IS
FOR HARD-CORE, INVESTIGATIVE
JOURNALISM.
SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO SOME
OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE
WORLD AND IN THIS COUNTRY, WE'RE
GOING TO LOOK INTO CERTAINLY THE
LARGEST POLITICIANS IN THIS
COUNTRY, SOME OF THE BUREAUCRATS
WHO ARE MAKING THE DECISION.
WE'RE GOING TO COVER THE HARD
STORIES THAT UNFORTUNATELY I
BELIEVE A LOT OF THE
ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA STILL LEAVES
UNCOVERED AND I REMEMBER THE
TIME I WAS AT MSNBC AND I WANTED
TO INVESTIGATE A STORY ABOUT RON
PAUL AND, I TOLD YOU
GUYS ABOUT THIS, AND I WAS
LOOKING AND I COULDN'T FIND ONE
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT AT MSNBC.
THERE WAS ONE GUY WHO WAS
WORKING FOR ANOTHER NETWORK AND
HE
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO CHASE DOWN
STORY FOR MSNBC ANCHORS.
THEY DON'T HAVE INVESTIGATIVE
REPORTER IN THE BUILDING.
THEY HAVE PEOPLE GO OUT ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, THEY ARE
PEOPLE WHO GO AND ASK QUESTIONS
AT PRESS CONFERENCES, BUT
THIS WAS NO INVESTIGATIVE
REPORTING DONE AT THE CABLE
NEWS STATIONS, SEE THE STEP TO
THE PLATE THAT YOU HELPED
US HIRE A LOT OF FOLKS AND IF
YOU GO RIGHT NOW, WE'RE
LAUNCHING
TYTNETWORK.COM/INVESTIGATE
TODAY.
IT IS UP RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN
SEE SOME OF THE ARTICLES THAT
THEY ALREADY WROTE AND THAT
IS FROM NAOMI
LACHANCE, MICHAEL TRACY, AND THE
MANAGING EDITOR JONATHAN LARSON
THAT
WE HAVE MORE COMING UP FOR YOU
INCLUDING TOMORROW.
WE ARE GOING TO DROP A STORY ON
TWO OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST
COMPANIES AND HOW THEY RELATE TO
AND HOW THEY HAVE POTENTIALLY
PREVARICATING ON THE BIGGEST
PROGRAM THAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION HAVE COMING UP.
SO I WANT YOU GUYS TO LOOK OUT
FOR THAT IN THE MORNING.
OBVIOUSLY, FOLLOW TYT
INVESTIGATES ON TWITTER AND
FACEBOOK SO YOU CAN GET THE
LATEST STORIES AS WE BREAK
THEM, AND THAT IS THEIR MISSION.
TO FIND THE NEWS AND BREAK IT.
SO THAT TEAM CAN'T WAIT TO GET
GOING AND THEY ARE.
IT BEGINS TODAY, AND WE WILL,
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK, HAVE
DIFFERENT STORIES FOR YOU GUYS
ABOUT HOW WHAT YOU SEE ON
TELEVISION FROM SOME OF THOSE
CORPORATE LEADERS AS THEY
SUPPORT SOME OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION POLICIES ARE NOT
TRUE.
REAL, HARD-CORE INVESTIGATIVE
JOURNALISM DONE WITH BACKS, DONE
WITH INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE
DIFFERENT NOTES AND MEMOS,
ETC.
OF SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT
AND BUSINESS OFFICIALS.
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT SO CHECK
IT OUT RIGHT NOW.
