I am told by conservatives that college campuses are a place where you just cannot speak freely at all and I don't want to over simplify their argument and there is merit to it there are some places where they have I think in my opinion become too zealous and in enforcing speech coats okay and my opinion is and I have said this from day one you should definitely let conservative speak on campus I'm not remotely afraid of their ideas and neither should you be you let the Conservatives come let 17 people go to those events and be done with it but there are some important things that are worth noting here first of all all those free speech advocates I know that you are the very next thing you're gonna do is support Colin Kaepernick and his right to free speech and now you've got all these teams of the NFL that won't sign Colin Kaepernick is he among the top 90 quarterbacks in the country of course any football fan knows that says everything everybody should start but among the top 90 quarterbacks but oh he dared to say something we don't like he said something about black lives matter make sure that he doesn't get his speech look I'm just waiting for you to organize those right-wing protests in favor of Kaepernick but they haven't done it yet cuz it turns out they kind of like their free speech not your free speech so now we're gonna Adam Carolla cuz he went in front of Congress they're taking this very very seriously so look let's see let's go to Adam Carolla in front of Congress talking about what special snowflake they the kids and colleges are now keep in mind by the way all the people who are conservatives who are incredibly offended if you say Happy Holidays to them instead of Merry Christmas why don't they just toughen up and become adults or cabernet GIJoe oh my god he had the wrong body position he wasn't standing he was crouching oh my god okay but let's have coral explain to us how college kids are snowflakes good we're talking a lot about the kids and I think they're just that kids we are the adults and I don't think we are doing the chill I mean these are eighteen and nineteen year old kids that are at these college campuses they grew up dipped in Purell playing soccer games where they never kept score and watching wah wah wah Zee and we're asking them to be mature we need the adults to start being the adults studies have shown that if you take people and you put them in a zero gravity environment like astronauts they lose muscle mass they lose bone density we're taking these kids in the name of protection we're putting them in a zero gravity environment and they're losing muscle mass in bone density they need to live in a world that has gravity when you you need to expose your children to germs and dirt in the environment to build up their immune system our plan is put them in a bubble keep them away from everything and somehow they'll come out strong or when they merge from the bubble well that's not happening children are the future but we are the present and worthy adults and we need to act like it see if you're an adult you say well I don't want to marry gay couples and I don't want to bake them cakes you know because my religion tells me I don't have to actually our Constitution demands it and our laws demanded mud I've lost muscle mass so I'm not going to be an adult I'm not gonna listen to rules you know why because I'm a Christian and I was dipped in Purell and I was told the christians ruled this country no we don't rule it with an iron fist anymore it's over here Purell so this goes both ways I am consistent on it let the conservator speak and and don't get too bent out of shape and by the way when we speak don't all get teary-eyed over Happy Holidays greetings the most special of all snowflakes you guys now there's a second part of this now of course it's put on by the Republicans so they bring in Corolla they bring in Shapiro oh my god and they're protesting us okay first of all as long as they let you speak and that's a big if and as long as they're not violent of course and by the way it wasn't the students who were violent at Berkeley was antiphon who is as nothing new with the students there so of course you shouldn't be any violence but you you're bent out of shape because they protest you but what you also don't know that all the knives progressives are disinvited from college campuses as well and how do they do it not be as a protest there aren't enough conservatives on college campus to put together those protests they're deeply unpopular no it is conservative people on the boards of the colleges it happened to Ana recently University of Colorado asked her to speak and somebody high up in the administration said oh the Young Turks offend Trump supporters no we don't allow her to speak but there's no big protests over that nobody's getting invited Congress over that because if you hold a position of power they you could block people's speech all day long but if people who are outraged protests how dare you protest okay now look I don't want to build a straw man I know that some of the Conservatives say no protests are fine some get their feelings hurt because they're very emotional so there's a range of conservatives on that issue but we haven't gotten on the main point here but Adam Kroll is so incensed about this that he's gonna join up with Dennis Prager Prager to apparently do a whole documentary about this and is there very cute trailer for that let's show you a piece of it the University of tomorrow is here a place of discovery tolerance and acceptance we prepare our students for tomorrow's workforce by helping them discover their true gender sexuality and racial identity judge people based on racial origin and history of oppression we call it the progressive step I'm black I'm Hispanic I'm Asian I'm a student at utopia University this university was created so I could be mean unless I don't want to be me then I can just be somebody else you can feed next to me alright well that those are all very funny you see like this university is great created to let me be me which is of course a terrible idea right off no you shouldn't be you you should do the things that we tell you to do okay because that's what conservative tradition is follow heritage okay Wow how horrible and utopian that they encouraged them to be themselves and the guy says though you could pee next to me like ah ha ha we shouldn't let trans people go in the wrong bathrooms I thought the service were for liberty that's weird it does seem like a free thing and are there really college campuses that are claiming that non Asian students are actually Asian or did you just make that up see that's what I'm talking about they make mountains out of molehills they had a congressional testimony over this stuff if you show me specific instances and there have been some I will support you and say of course you should be allowed to speak but when you get into like oh my god my feelings are hurt because some college campus lets you be you that's not a thing I'm overly concerned about all right now who's krola doing this with let's watch you have a group of insanely miserable people who are just hammers looking for a nail the president Trump could just build a wall around the campuses and keep everything in the campus that would be fine but this horrible childlike adolescent attitude is spreading into society the reason Dennis and I got together on this project is because he has more wisdom than anybody I know and I'm funny if you say so okay you know you're really funny when you have to tell people that so dennis prager is an enormous right winger so if we had a question about where Adam Carolla stands on the political spectrum that has been solved because sometimes people say oh he's moderate because you know he's okay with sex or something no Dennis Prager it he thinks is apparently the wisest guy in the country lunatic fringe right-winger so you might not agree with that you might say no no no we should be ruled by religion and tax cuts for the rich or awesome and political corruption in the form of campaign donations are wonderful okay fine okay I guess that's who Adam thinks is the wisest guy in the country but this is really important remember this is not really about free speech it partly is but it's all about paid speech because all these guys get paid to go to college campuses you know different organizations sponsor them sometimes as a college itself and sometimes in the case of Shapiro for example when he's going to Berkeley that's a huge story in the news you know that he's getting paid $20,000 for that and I don't 'progress him that at all and I'm gonna ask you guys a poll question in a second and I would actually vote yes even though it's the college's money if it was the college's money I would still vote yes in the case of Berkeley it isn't it's the young America's Foundation Berkeley is providing a free venue which also cost money security which also cost money but that's okay that's part of when they Klan marches in town we provide security for that too and that's part of freedom of speech but it does have a cost and I bring that up because I remember when Republicans would say why is the government funding art that offends us remember the Robert Mapplethorpe controversy so he was a very controversial artist and he would do things like dip a crucifix in urine and people were like why are we having taxpayer money go to Mapplethorpe that's outrace I'm offended I'm a snowflake that was offended I got triggered I don't want my money going to it okay wait a minute now if we use that approach then why should if it is a university that is paying for it and oftentimes it is comes out of this overall student fund why should they pay with their own money to get insulted now you told me that conservatives don't like it being assaulted with their own money which there's some logic to and you told me that all the universities and colleges are so liberal overwhelmingly liberal so can I go to Liberty University and force them to pay me to insult them because I don't agree with their Christianity and it is important the private public distinction so with private universities that is less the case and I just had a conversation with Ben Shapiro and he says yes private universities should not be forced if I understand his argument right but public universities are a different matter now at the end of the day I think freedom of speech is so important that I'm gonna say yes they should be allowed to speak and if the university overall through the student funds pays for it that's the locate even if you don't agree with it look the Tibetan community might be a minority community but it would be amazing if they brought the Dali Lama or someone else just because they're a minority in the college campus doesn't mean we shouldn't pay to have their speakers in so but I want you to know the full context because as Hassan piker was another host on our network here said at politican and a debate he had over the weekend so look you could do freedom of speech anytime you want you could just go to a McDonald's one foot outside of campus and have all the speeches you want it's a free country and all the same students can come now on principle I agree that they should be allowed on college campuses I don't want them doing that but this is also about their right to get paid so that brings up an interesting question that I wanted to ask you guys about so that's our poll of the day so tea white tea network.com slash free speech should colleges pay for conservative speakers now let's assume that's public colleges okay because private colleges I of course you can't force them to pay and we're not talking about force here we're asking should and I'm gonna say yes they should but it is certainly an interesting question and whatever the answer is it should definitely be applied equally to conservatives and progressives whether it's students protesting them or administrators in the dark of night saying I don't like progressives and even if the student body voted for it I'm gonna kill it so I now kick it over to you guys and we will have the results of that poll on tomorrow's show help us build independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
