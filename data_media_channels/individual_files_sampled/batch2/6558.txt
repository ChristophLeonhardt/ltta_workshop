they wanted to believe that it was just people in the factory that were affected by all this but unfortunately they had clear information that the levels of exposure for people outside the factory were actually higher than the people work in the factory but when they determined should we tell people outside the factory they did they kept it a secret their own scientists again and again their own lawyers in fact tell them you know we really should we should tell people about this because they're drinking it in their water DuPont became aware that the chemical has seeped beyond its plant and they wanted to figure out how far it had gotten so a team went out with some jugs plastic jars and went to general stores and went miles downriver to collect samples they didn't say why they were collecting samples or that they were from the company but in testing these samples found that in fact the chemical had gone quite far from the plant
