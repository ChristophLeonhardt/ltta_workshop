What you just saw
is a re-creation
of an asteroid hitting the
Earth. If the asteroid were
the size of a pea
and it was slamming
into a tiny piece of the Earth.
It also shows a surprising
way huge amounts of water
could have reached our planet.
That’s important.
Earth has a lot of water.
About 70% of its surface
is covered with it.
But where did it come from?
There are different
ideas about how
to account for Earth’s water.
It could have been
here from the start
or arrived via comets
or interplanetary dust.
And then there are asteroids.
Unlike comets that are
essentially frozen dust balls,
asteroids carry molecules of
water bound up with their rock.
Four-plus billion
years ago, the Earth
was pummeled by asteroids
in a time called
the “late bombardment."
It was thought that the
water in the asteroids
would be lost during the
intense heat of the impacts,
but that may not be so.
Scientists used
NASA’s vertical gun —
an apparatus three
stories high —
to mimic the process with
much, much smaller objects.
They shot a
pea-sized bit of rock
called “antigorite,” composed
partly of water, into a tiny bit
of pumice with no water.
The tiny rock projectile
only goes about 10 feet,
but at more than
11,000 miles per hour.
Scientists found that despite
extreme temperatures on impact,
up to 30% of the
pebble asteroid’s water
was trapped in melted rock.
As the stand-in
asteroid made contact,
the pumice melted
and fused together
with tiny bits of the
projectile in a substance
called “breccia."
Vaporized water molecules
were trapped in the breccia,
some of which you can see here.
For real asteroids
hitting the Earth,
that could be a lot of water.
And it could be released
later, for example,
in steam from lava flows.
So asteroids could
conceivably have
delivered enormous amounts
of water to the planet
and helped make life
on Earth possible.
