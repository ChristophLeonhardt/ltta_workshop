1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,829
This crab spider is not
just scuttling around.

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:08,050
It is thinking about flying.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,190
Once on top of this
artificial dome,

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,960
it raises a leg to
sample the airflow.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,270
Once it’s satisfied,
it raises its abdomen,

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,810
turns on its spinnerets — 
the silk-making organs —

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,570
and shoots threads
skyward until it launches.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,470
It’s called ballooning,
but the spiders hang only

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,460
from their own silk threads.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,020
Incredibly, these
spiders are known

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,080
to ride the wind across
oceans and can reach

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,120
heights of a mile or two.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,350
And sometimes, so many
spiders launch together

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,560
that the ground becomes
blanketed with spider silk.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,610
Spiders use ballooning to
seek food, avoid danger,

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,800
find a mate.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,100
But much is still
unknown about the physics

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,400
of spider flight.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,510
And that’s what drew
Moonsung Cho to study them.

20
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,160
Here he is in Berlin.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,510
You can see the path a
ballooning spider takes

22
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,520
after launching
from his finger.

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,490
Cho has carried out
dozens of tests in nature.

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,070
But for detailed analysis,
he took spiders to the lab

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,610
where he tested them
in a wind tunnel.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,010
The researchers found that the
spiders prefer mild breezes.

27
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,200
And the silk they spin can
measure up to six feet long.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,540
Amazingly, it seems
to be not the breeze,

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,300
but what you might think of
as the stickiness of the air

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,140
that holds them aloft.

31
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,020
Imagine a thread suspended in
a thick fluid, like a syrup.

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,620
It won’t sink.

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,700
And if the fluid
is moving along,

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,470
the thread moves with it.

35
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,880
A strand of silk may be more
than a thousand times thinner

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,110
than a human hair.

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,890
So for spider silk,
the air is that fluid,

38
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,410
moving swiftly along to
take the spiders far afield.

39
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,760
These spiders don’t need an
actual balloon to fly,

40
00:01:52,760 --> 00:00:00,000
just their own amazing silk.
