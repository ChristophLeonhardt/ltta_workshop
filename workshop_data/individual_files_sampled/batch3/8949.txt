DOWN HERE THIS MORNING. JESSE? Jesse: THANKS, CASEY. ALL RIGHT, KIMBERLY JUST SO YOU KNOW ANOTHER HORRIBLE TRAGEDY ON A FRIDAY IN THIS COUNTRY IT SEEMS LIKE ALMOST ONCE A MONTH AT THIS POINT. WHAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU AFTER YOU HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THIS? ANYTHING SPECIFIC AND ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN REFLECT ON FOR THE AUDIENCE? Kimberly: YEAH, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, CAN YOU FEEL IT, RIGHT? IT'S HEAVY. YOU HATE TO REPORT ON A STORY LIKE THIS FAMILY MEMBERS. PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. INCLUDING PARENTS OF EVEN THE SHOOTER IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WENT WRONG. PEOPLE THINKING TO THEMSELVES A SENSE OF GUILT AND RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE TO PREVENT SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS. THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES IS HEART-BREAKING. THOSE INJURED AND THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO THE FAMILIES AND ALSO TO THE HOSPITALS, YOU KNOW, WORKERS, THE NURSES, THE DOCTORS. EVERYBODY WHO MOVED IN TO TRY TO SAVE LIVES SO THAT THERE WEREN'T EVEN MORE FATALITIES. I KNOW IN TERMS OF THE INVESTIGATION THEY REALLY DO HAVE TO DO A DEEP DIVE INTO HIS SOCIAL MEDIA, INTO THINK KIND OF MOTIVE, MENTAL STATE. BUT, ALSO IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT HE COMMUNICATED WITH? THEY WERE ALSO GOING TO BE QUESTIONING A COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE. THEY ARE CONCERNED AND THEY SET UP A VERY LARGE PERIMETER IN CASE THERE ARE ANY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THAT HAD BEEN SECLUDED AROUND THE AREA OF THE PROPERTY OR SCHOOL THAT COULD STILL CAUSE HARM. RIGHT AWAY YOU GOING TO BE WANTING TO QUESTION THIS INDIVIDUAL TO DETERMINE THAT THERE IS NO FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE OR CASUALTY IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS. AND YOU SEE KIND OF THE ELEVATION SHOTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND REALLY CHECK THE AREA TO MAKE SURE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING ELSE THAT DOESN'T GO UNDETECTED. Jesse: HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE HIS LIFE. DID HE NOT TAKE HIS OWN LIFE AND HE IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. SO, LAW ENFORCEMENT, GREG, GOING TO BE ABLE TO INTERROGATE HIM PRETTY THOROUGHLY. YEAH. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE DID THIS FUN STORY FOR THE LAST COUPLE DAYS THE LAUREL AND YANNY THING. I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE EVERY NEWS STORY THROUGH THAT PRISM. EVERYBODY GOES INTO THEIR SEPARATE SIDES. IT'S EITHER LAUREL, WHICH IS WE NEED MORE ARMED SECURITY OR IT'S YANNY, THERE ARE TOO MANY GUNS. AND IT'S TOO MANY GUNS VERSUS NOT ENOUGH ONLY WAY TO GET THROUGH THIS STUFF AND MOVE BEYOND IT IS GET OUT OF THIS PRISON OF TWO IDEAS. AND ACTUALLY SEEK A COMPROMISE FROM BOTH SIDES TO LOOK AT OKAY, WHAT EFFECTIVE GUN CONTROL MEASURE WOULD WORK? I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT TAGS CERTAIN PEOPLE CONSIDERED TO BE HIGH RISK BY TEACHERS AND AUTHORITIES. A CIVIL COURT THAT TAGS THIS PERSON SO THEY CAN'T HAVE GUNS. THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS GUY HE GOT THE GUNS FROM HIS PARENTS. SO HE GETS THROUGH. SO THE OTHER THING THEN IS TO TRAIN MORE ARMED PERSONNEL. BECAUSE THE VARIABLE THAT EFFECTS CASUALTY RATE IS THE DURATION BETWEEN THE FIRST GUN THAT IS UNHOLSTERRED AND THE SECOND GUN THAT ARRIVES TO STOP HIM IF IT INDEED STOPS HIM OR ANY KIND OF HARD TARGET. Kimberly: THE RESPONSE WEAPON. Greg: THESE ARE TWO THINGS THAT COME FROM TWO AREAS. ONE COMES FROM GUN CONTROL WHEN WHICH IS A COURT THAT PROVIDES A CIVIC TAG AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE ARMED PERSONNEL WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE ENHANCES FREEDOM AND SECURITY IS TO HAVE SOMEBODY THERE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE THIRD THING, AS ALWAYS, IS THE MEDIA. AND THE MEDIA HAS TO BE AWARE THAT BLANKET COVERAGE CREATES INCENTIVE FOR MORE OF THESE EVENTS BECAUSE IT CREATES INFAMY. AND THIS IS ABOUT INFAMY. THIS IS NOT LIKE STREET CRIME. THIS IS THE TYPE OF CRIME THAT IS SYMBOLIC NILISTIC ACT THAT THE PERSON DOES SO THEY CAN LIVE FOREVER. AND IN OUR HEADS. AND IT WORKS BECAUSE WE CONSTANTLY DO BLANKET COVERAGE. SO IF WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO PULL BACK FROM THIS AND NOT TALK ABOUT THIS PERSON AND NOT MENTION HIS NAME BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO CREATE MORE OF THEM. IS HE TRENDING ON TWITTER. Jesse: HE IS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WERE ALARMED BY, DANIEL, IS HE HAD THIS BIG TRENCH COAT IN TEXAS, WHICH IS VERY HOT. PEOPLE SAID WHY ARE YOU WEARING A TRENCH COAT? Dana: APPARENTLY THOUGH, I HAD OPPORTUNITY TO ANCHOR THE HOURS WITH TRACE GALLAGHER AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE ONE OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE INTERVIEWED SHE SAID HE WORE THE TRENCH COAT EVERY DAY. WHAT WAS DIFFERENT TODAY WAS THAT HE WORE A T-SHIRT UNDER NEATH IT THAT SAID BORN TO KILL. Jesse: OH, GOD. Dana: IT WAS INTERESTING INTERVIEWING THOSE STUDENTS. ALL THREE OF THEM WERE YOUNG WOMEN. THEY ARE SO POISED. Jesse: ISN'T THAT AMAZING. Dana: MATURE AND ARTICULATE AND ABLE TO PUT THEIR THOUGHTS TOGETHER. I THINK IT WAS VERY DISTURBING AND PARENTS ALL OF THEM SAID THEY WEREN'T ENTIRELY SURPRISED. THEY SORT OF EXPECTED THIS MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEM BECAUSE, AS GREG WAS JUST SAYING WE COVER THEM AND IT HAPPENS ALL TOO OFTEN OTHER THING SIMILAR THEY HAD JUST DONE FIRE DRILLS AND ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS AT THIS SCHOOL AND THEY HAD SOME RESOURCES ACTUALLY THAT THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE STATE IN ORDER TO GET THAT DONE. I ASKED ONE OF THEM DO YOU THINK IT HELPED TO SAVE LIVES? AND SHE SAID ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT TO DO AND ONE OF THE TEACHERS, THE BAND TEACHER WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO PUT THEM UP INTO A ROOM THAT HAS A SOLID CONCRETE WALL SO THAT NOBODY CAN HEAR THE MUSIC BEING PLAYED. SO THAT TEACHER WAS VERY QUICK-THINKING. THE HOSPITAL HAD ALSO JUST DONE A DRILL. SO, THEY ARE LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER SO THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE LIVES VERY QUICKLY. GREG INMADE THIS POINT VERY WELL BEFORE. ON ALL ENDS, LAW ENFORCEMENT, SCHOOLS AND THE MEDICAL TEAMS, IN PARTICULAR, MODERN MEDICINE IS AMAZING BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE THESE DRILLS, THEY ARE ABLE TO SAVE A LOT MORE LIVES MORE QUICKLY. I ALSO WOULD POINT PEOPLE TO LOOKING TO CHARLES COOK. HE WRITES ON NATIONAL REVIEW ABOUT THIS OBSESSION OF COPYING THE COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTERS. IT'S ALMOST TEXTBOOK. AND YOU CAN GO THROUGH IT'S VERY CHILLING WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AND BECOMES A LITTLE BIT OF THE THING IF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THIS PRISON OF TWO IDEAS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS FIGHT. IN THE MEANTIME IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP IT BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLINE AND THEY ARE DOING THIS. THE ONLY POSSIBLE THING THAT YOU COULD DO, MORE DRILLS AND HARDENING OF TARGET. CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL MCCAUL FROM THAT DISTRICT. THIS IS SUCH A SMALL WORLD THING, JUST YESTERDAY HE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR GRANTS AND MONEY FOR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO TAKE ACTIONS AS THEY SEE FIT BUT INCLUDING CERTAINLY THESE TYPES OF DRILLS. AND THEN I SAID WOULD THAT MONEY BE TIED TO ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR? HE SAID NO. THE LAST ONE I WOULD MAKE IS THAT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID IS THAT THIS SHOOTER TOOK THE GUN FROM THE FATHER. HE IS ONLY 17 YEARS OLD. HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE GUN IN ANY WAY. THEY JUST IMPLORED PARENTS IF YOU HAVE WEAPONS THAT YOU LEGALLY OWN, MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE LOCKED UP AND THAT YOUR CHILDREN CAN'T GET AHOLD OF THEM. Jesse: THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. THE WEAPONS HE USED A 38 REVOLVER AND A SHOTGUN. RICHARD. RICHARD: I THINK DANA IS RIGHT. I PULLED A QUOTE FROM A YOUNG WOMAN. NO, THERE WASN'T. IT'S BEEN HAPPENING ALL OVER. I HAVE ALWAYS KIND OF FELT LIKE EVENTUALLY IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. I WASN'T SURPRISED. I WAS JUST SCARED. AND AS I WATCHED HER INTERVIEW AND AS I WAS PREPARING FOR THE SHOW, THAT QUOTE STUCK OUT TO ME BECAUSE I THINK I'M ONE OF THE YOUNGER FOLKS AT THIS TABLE AND I WAS JUST LIKE I LITERALLY GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE 10 YEARS AGO, AND WE NEVER HAD ACTIVE SHOOTER TRAININGS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THAT WAS 14 YEARS AGO. AND TO THINK THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY ARE SAYING AT 17, LIKE I ALMOST EXPECTED IT TO HAPPEN AT MY SCHOOL. AND SO WHEN IT HAPPENED, I WASN'T SCARED. TO ME, THIS IS SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE GOT TO REALLY DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER AS ADULTS AND AS LAWMAKERS AND AS PEOPLE OF INFLUENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY IS SAFE, WELCOMING, AND THRIVING. WE HAVE GOT TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE. PART OF IT IS HOW WE HARDEN SOFT TARGETS AND THE OTHER PART IS HOW WE RESTRICT ACCESS TO GUNS. RIGHT? AND PART OF IT IS MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GUNS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND MAKING SURE IF YOU ARE A GUN OWNER AND PARENT AND HAVE YOU YOUNG PEOPLE IN YOUR HOUSE, YOU LOCK THOSE GUNS UP SO THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THEM. Kimberly: AND MENTALLY STABLE. ABSOLUTELY. AND THE OTHER PART IS FIXING, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IT HIMSELF, MAKING SURE WE COMMIT TO FIXING THE BACKGROUND SYSTEM. Dana: IN THIS CASE IN PARTICULAR. IT WOULDN'T HAVE SOLVED IT AND I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT MAKES THIS EVEN MORE SOBERING FOR ME IS THAT THIS WEEKEND FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IS GRADUATION WEEKEND. AND SO SOME AND A WE ARE GOING TO HEAR MORE STORIES AS WE GO INTO THIS WEEKEND ABOUT SOME OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND I'M PRETTY SURE SOME OF THEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN WEARING A CAP AND GOWN THIS WEEKEND AND THEY WON'T BE. Kimberly: REMEMBER THOSE DAYS WHEN WE USED TO DO EARTHQUAKE DRILLS THAT WAS THE BIGGEST DANGER IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR STUDENTS.
