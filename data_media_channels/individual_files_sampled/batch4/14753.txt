oh hi better it's August 17th I'm Angela Vance and you're watching battleground hey welcome to the show do you know that every single Friday unless I'm traveling or doing something that makes me have to leave the side of my trusty laptop I do something called battleground which uses the new thing that Google YouTube has allowed us to do for a few months now it's called super chat that's their word as you can see on the right hand side of the screen your comments come up as usual but super chat is a new thing that YouTube added where for a few bucks or few lira or a few rupees you can make your comment highlight it in a bright color to stand out from all the others and as I'm looking forward I see it out of the corner of my eye and I'll immediately read it and the great news for us here the rebel is we get a portion of those revenues I think in seventy percent so we help pay our bills which is good because YouTube of course has demonetized us and the rest of the conservative web hey at least they haven't banned us yet like they have banned Alex Jones hey I want to talk about our millionth subscriber guys so get ready to show that thanks a million website but I'm just talking to our team here but let me tell you a quick thing I mean we we just hit a million subscribers on YouTube which i think is pretty cool I'm I know we're being throttled in a few ways I already mentioned that were demonetized on the ad side and notifications people regularly say that they don't receive notifications for videos I mean really when you've got 1 million subscribers and you do a live chat and you have 258 people watching it's pretty clear that the other nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and fifty did not get a notification I'm not whining I'm just explaining what's going on like I say at least we weren't delete it all together as was Alex Jones he had about 2.4 2.5 million YouTube subscribers that is mighty I mean there are bigger sites of course there's some you know PewDiePie has more than 50 million these ones 60 million or something but he's an entertainer he's a gamer he said he said you know there's a lot of music sites there's a lot of pop-culture sites movie sites but in terms of news commentary Alex Jones was from the biggest with 2.4 million and they just push the button and deleted him not only shut his account down but also wiping out thousands of videos he had we have 9700 videos on our system and they would be deleted in the button push for button but that's what could happen to us but let me show you our thanks a million dot CA websites we actually look at that well I'm so ugly I'm so glad I don't have to look at me most of the time look at that picture there thanks a million dot see a scroll down a bit because we have a commemorative pin and I sort of like the pin it go down further so we can show the pin there you go you see that pin there there's two different versions of it I like the one on top I call it gunmetal gray and then we got a color one the mill the 1 million club and we're as you can see we just started to sort of crowdfunding there 50 bucks each for the gunmetal gray and there's other prices too and it's a fundraiser absolutely it is and I don't apologize for that because we have to pay the bills Alex Jones pays the bills with his supplements and vitamins we've got these pins so if you want to pin feel free to subscribe sorry not subscribe feel free to my pin and you can wear it and it's like a secret signal but someone else sees that pin and they know what you're about and whatnot so there you go we we got a million subscribers and thank you for being amongst them and here's what I like to cover today it is 12 or 3 p.m. on Fridays we used to do this every day but I just couldn't be in my computer every day at 12:00 noon Eastern Time so we do it every Friday and we used to call Fridays free for all Fridays which means I would just read a ton of comments and I'm gonna do that today but there are a few things I'm going to touch on also I've got a very interesting video from British Columbia at their gay pride parade where a Persian man who I presume is gay walks through with a sign that says Allah is gay and we'll play you some of that I'm not going to play all of that for you why don't you guys why don't we get it ready I want to play it let's cut it in half because it's a little long but I want to play the second half where he encounters people who say you can't do that and so let's get that ready it's a show that's armed and Navabi he's obviously not a practicing Muslim I think he I don't think he is I think he's an atheist but maybe he's just a liberal Muslim I don't know I don't know if other Muslims would regard him as Muslim but there's some interesting moments there I want to show you that video because it's interesting I want to show you some more of social media banning our friends our friend Gavin McInnes was just taken off of Twitter just boom he had what a quarter million or more followers and Twitter just said no you may wish to choose to follow Gavin McInnes but we don't believe you should consenting adults to have the power to follow again McInnis I see out of the corner of my eye a super chat the corker chips in five bucks and says will justin trudeau fire it quick Howard I doubt it and right under that red pill Scott five pound says hey looking to offer a rebel voice here in Scotland well thanks very much red pill Scott why don't you send us an email two careers at the rebel dawn media careers at the rubber rebel dome media with a link to a sample of your work like you if you got a video out there it doesn't even have to be fancy it can be like a something you shoot on your webcam or even your cell phone don't worry about the production value just want to see what you look like sound like feel like talk about things like that mmm prim pal oh wait congratulations on passing a million subscribers thank you very much but let me come back to the corker who says well Justin Trudeau fire ikura Khalid can we get an image of Achra Khalid with that gentleman from there's a Palestinian activist and that's fine and Palestinian Canadians are citizens or they can be and they can have their points of view they can even take strong points of view against Israel that's fine that's part of democra see but this one activist whose name I don't want to get it wrong it's not right in front of me it's just a full born full blown out of hand anti-semite and that's different that's different now get meThe lawful it's not against the law to hate anybody in Canada you can't you can't ban hate it's a human emotion but what you can do is you can exercise political judgment so let's put that up here and I want to show you it Chris Khalid who is the Pakistani born Muslim MP who brought in the anti Islamophobia motion you can see the man in question Amin el mooood he's standing there with Justin Trudeau and he's standing on the right there I don't know who with can I get one with him and a crow Khalid anyhow on two occasions now Achra Khalid this Pakistani born Muslim MP has given an award to this gentleman on two occasions and the first time it was such a scandal that many reports documented how anti-semitic can have virulent he was so you you might give equally the benefit of the doubt and say oh well you know she didn't know but when she did it a second time you can't make that mistake twice in a row and a group that's a watchdog for anti-jewish hate it's called benign brief there you go you know giving him a celebratory commemorative certificate now there was such a fuss that she later apologized so I didn't know as an accident now that that's just not credible it's not credible but here's my point and I know our American and our British viewers are saying well I don't know who the sacred Colleen is and I don't know you know much about this other character but let me tell you this the reason is where Khalid is not just some no-name backbenchers because she introduced into the Canadian part emotion called m103 which is an anti Islamophobia motion which will ban Islamophobia using the whole of government so everything from the police to the courts to the media to the budgets to the tax code to our Border Patrol whatever all of it will be tasked to fighting Islamophobia but what does Islamophobia mean would the motion didn't define that Sochi it basically means whatever she says it means it means anyone she wants to shop she'll call an islamaphobe and I was I was following this eruption on Twitter over the last few days as a crow Khalid was actually so embarrassed by the fact that her dirty deeds were revealed to the public of it she apologized and someone said isn't it ironic the VMP who is pushing for an anti Islamophobia motion also happens to be an MP rewarding an anti-semite and I wrote back on Twitter how's that ironic ironic is two things that are in contradiction to each other as the Alanis Morissette song goes you know it's like mm spoons when all you need is a knife that's not really ironic but do you see my point there's a contradiction there there is no contradiction between threatening anyone who criticizes Islam with legal punishment and that same threat nur promoting anti-semitism there's no contradiction they go hand in hand that's equally that's my answer to one of the super chests I see now the super chat Blaine Sandberg Congrats to you on a million subscribers well thank you very much Blaine I want to make sure I've got all the comments there I think I might have missed one here we go puppy Strachan 4:49 australian well thank you very much for that I think I've caught up on all of those so let me without further to do show you this video and you know what we heared the rebel we try to shine a light of support and publicity on our progressive Muslim friends people in the States you may know Zhu D Jasser in London I've got this magic nawaz we've never interacted with him but I admire him from a farm in Canada we have friends whether it's Celine man sewer in London Ontario or Raheel Raza here in Toronto Tarek Fatah excellent people I want to show you someone I've never met him but I think it's name is Armin Navabi which i think is a Persian name and he's gay obviously and he's living the Canadian lifestyle which means he's not living under Sharia law - real I'd be thrown off the top of a roof so you know I'm just reading from his biography here is the author the best known selling book why there is no God and a co-host of secular jihadists that's a funny phrase isn't it so I guess he would call himself an ex-muslim let me read from the top there Armand Navabi is an iranian-born ex Muslim atheist and secular activist author podcaster and vlogger currently live living in Vancouver Canada so so he would not so apparently I was gonna say I called him a liberal Muslim or Muslim reformer he's clearly calls himself a next Muslim and an atheist but look what he did at the Vancouver gay pride parade which is a very large gay pride parade it's probably the largest one in Canada the second largest let's just play a few minutes and I'd like the second half of the video if you please go ahead this seems like a very simple thing to do here and it is there's not that much consequences for saying something like that Sarah is gay here but this is punishable by death in many countries we just want to show to them as they're watching that there are places where you could get away with saying stuff like this nothing can happen to you and give them hope give them hope that if we can get away with that the death penalty or imprisonment in a country like that and not only be free to say it and to show you how much positive support we got from people there's hope for your country love has to win not just here but everywhere I love what you just write down oh it's so wonderful to see that hmmm that is an interesting story you know what I was unsure if he called himself officially an atheist let's see now that he does I thought it was interesting that there were a couple of Muslim men men of course men men are the enforcers of religious modesty in theocracies like Saudi Arabia in Iran you can imagine if they would say that in Canada in Vancouver which is a liberal City and obviously in the precincts of a gay pride parade what they would say perhaps in their mosque or to women so that shows that even in Canada you have some strains of that what was interesting to me was listening to Navabi he I think he was doing it as a test I don't think he actually believes Allah is gay I don't think anyone does he was just doing it as a test to show as he said people in the Muslim world that there is perhaps hope that things can change I don't think that proves the point though because Vancouver is free and liberal especially on matters of sexuality but Iran is still not there is some uprising there are some uprisings in Iran and I think we need to support them more but Saudi and you would say there's a drop of reform in Saudi Arabia I see that some women are allowed to drive under some circumstances now but I don't think it necessarily proves hopefulness that Canada is free if Iran isn't and let me ask you a question about Canada and about the United Kingdom which I know better and better these days and about continental Europe is the trend there towards more or less Sharia law in the public square is that the trend there - more or less tolerance for this I'm in Navi if he were to walk through London England would he get such a happy response Vancouver is not a very Muslim City there are South Asians there are people from the Indian subcontinent some of them are Muslim of course but as you may know if you know Canada the large demographic minorities in that city or Chinese Sikh Filipino Kurian it's taiwanese it's Toronto and Montreal that have the much larger Muslim population London and Windsor so I don't know if Armen NAV appealable to get away with that in Toronto or in Mississauga a more Muslim suburb I know he wouldn't be able to get away with it in many parts of London I know he'd probably be stoned in Luton and I know there's some parts of Paris where he'd be stabbed and I put it to you and the same in Rotterdam and Malmo Sweden I put it to you that all of these places I've just lived listed in the West are going more towards the Iranian more towards the Saudi way then Saudi and Iran are going towards the Vancouver way would you agree with me on that would you agree with me that while he is experiencing this moments of total liberation in Vancouver that the trend is against him that's what I believe alright let's go and grab some more comments it's 12 17 I do this every Friday from 12 noon to 1 p.m. Eastern mmm I'm just gonna read JP I saw a gang of Muslims in London Ontario attack a white man you know I take your word for it there are plenty of gangs in Canada there's an enormous problem with Somali gangs can you call up the list of the most wanted criminals in Toronto I saw a man a man Montenegrin Oh tweeted but you could probably find it just as fast it was sort of a starling sure if you look at the most wanted criminals in Toronto they have one thing in common and they're not the Irish they're not Aereo obeyed Sayed Akhil white Ibrahim Mohamed shaquan McLean Abdul Qadeer Han dual Mehmet occurred they're not all Muslim I I see I'd say they're 50 to 60% Muslim Allah swore Sami Mohammad Kaleem communing Hossein go Jani it's not a hundred percent Muslim it's absolutely isn't and there's a white guy at the bottom Denis Melvin how and a woman named Rosaline Wallace they have their on the list as you can see they being wanted for homicides in the 1980s but if you scroll up you can see the demographic change in the great city of Toronto yeah and now we have police in Canada who in Halifax for example there's been a spate of rapes by Halifax taxi drivers and Halifax is a great little town great little city going there next week and there's a shocking like rape after rape after rape of girls being raped by by taxi drivers and for the first few times they reported the identity of the taxi drivers sometimes if he got away the girl would say it was a some of the middle-eastern accent and darker skin and an Arab accent her Muslim accent but after a while they stopped describing the men I remember one hilarious and sad instance where they were just described as having an accent now if you describe someone who's having an accent I suppose you told me something more than I knew before you can rule out a native-born Canadian but who do you rule in now the girl who was raped obviously heard the accent and she probably could identify it but when you just say an accent was it an Italian accent was it that you the judge said maybe was it a Jamaican accent there's so many different was at a cockney accent oi mate was that a downunder accent was the Chinese I mean you not say yes police say the attackers are men mostly with dark hair and aged between 30 and 50 most spoke with an accent and many had must okay dark hair so you told me what the dark hair is what's the skin color and what accents what sexual assault allegations and Halifax taxi spark warnings oh this is a gorgeous to scroll down I remember this story the warnings are hey girls here's where to sit in a taxi look at that 12 sexual assault complaints at Cannes and taxi drivers in recent years keep scrolling down keeps true if this is 7 to 14 cases police have identified suspects I keep going down keep your own down there there there Muslim I'm sorry I just why can we not say that I think if you go down keep going down until I get to the police advise down down down down down down there there man down keep going what could I do police have offered these safety tips hey guys hey guys sit in the back seat on the right hand side so you're far from the driver and near the curb if you need to get out quickly hey girls hey girls we know there's rapist swarming you but if you can just sit wear it cuz and watch out for people with accents what like a Newfoundland accent it is the Quebec accent hey girls hey girls keep your phone in your hand or nearby girls you'll be fine dear they're more afraid of being called racist than they are afraid of rapists by the way I mean I've done a lot of stories on these taxi rapes and the Halifax when they find the man and they charge them they don't necessarily pull his taxi license they let them keep picking up more girls really think of that I read one case I think it's being appealed right now where a woman was found in the car her pants down at her ankles being raped allegedly by taxi driver who whose defense was oh she wanted this she consented to it she was drunk half passed out and he was having sex with her in the car because what young Halifax girl doesn't dream of a romantic encounter in a dirty smelly cab on the side of a road and if I'm recalling the case correctly the judge said well we don't know she didn't consent because the judges would rather tolerate rate rapists then racists and that's how you got yourself rather and what's coming to Canada it's coming to Canada sorry to say it folks like LnL ght n-no lighten two dollars in London stand he would have been acid attack you're exactly right luther bob's as have you heard of thomas quicken i just bought his book the danger political this time to canada have you ever had him on your show no i haven't had him on my show i see his work here and there I noticed he just got published on the gate Stone Institute I would like to read his work some more and I would be open to having him on the show of course I just want to get to know him and his work a little bit better all right it's twelve twenty four and Jimmy's had forty nine says Ezra I hear we will have a new federal holiday yeah you might not because it's a statutory holiday that only government workers will get for sure but it's going to be an aboriginal day but not any old Aboriginal day I by the way am sympathetic towards having an Aboriginal holiday for our viewers overseas that means Indians we don't say Indian usually although it's called an Indian act in this country we say Aboriginal or First Nations or indigenous the proposal though is not a day celebrating Indians their history their culture their language their you know geography their art that's not the proposal that would be interesting to me I would actually like to know a little bit more about what Aboriginal life was like back then stuff curiosity but where I happened to you know I think it's in the central part of the Canadian story they're here first I'd like to know more about it but that's not what this national day is about this day is not about history it's not about culture and it's not about the future either it's not about a day where we can talk about economic development for Aboriginal people who are further behind relative to the general population in Canada then african-americans are in respect of the general population of America so Canadians love to feel morally superior to Americans looking at the gap between white and black Americans but our own gap between Aboriginal people and white people is much larger but we do something very strategic that they won't that they don't do in the States see in the States the social and economic and crime dysfunction that they have to deal with it's right in the inner cities most of the time so you can't avoid it if you go to a big American city you go to Philadelphia you go to parts of New York you go to Washington DC we didn't majority black City go to Baltimore you go to Detroit you see with your eyes the result of policies and you see the problem can of are much more sophisticated we push our problem out of sight out of mind on to India Mercer's now there are a lot of urban Indians but we like to push our problems so we don't have to be faced with them so we can feel morally superior to Americans anyhow my point is this new holiday it's not a celebration it's not a positive affirmation it is a holiday of shame where Canadians will be told about the atrocities we've committed in the past including an alleged genocide against Aboriginal people of course Canada committed no such genocide genocide the plain meaning the word is to wipe out the genes you wipe out the old gene pool the Holocaust was an attempted genocide the Armenian genocide perpetrated by the Turks was Muslim Turks trying to kill all the Armenian Christians that's a genocide Canada did not commit a genocide there may have been individual atrocities along the way I'm absolutely know that by the way there was wars between the British the French and aboriginals on the other side all the time in fact Indian bands Indian tribes sometimes were allies of this or that European army so of course there were atrocities on all sides by the way but why on earth would you make a national holiday entrenching repeating obsessing over failures or negativity instead of celebrating hoping promoting isn't that what most holidays are about I think they should be I see a couple more Super chats have come in I do one Nova or Syrian says speaking of criminal activities in Toronto do you have any thoughts and comments regarding David Menzies recent missions on the local Toronto city councillors cockroach comment controversy oh yes I do I was away that day and so my friend David Menzies hosted the show I haven't show every every night at 8 p.m. called the Ezra Levant Road just so I don't forget what it's called it was named to help me remember and he interviewed it at Toronto City Council named George I'm a man lady who's regarded as a conservative force on council I don't think I've actually even interviewed him before but he seems like a nice guy and he was talking about some gang infested social housing in a Toronto neighborhood it's the same problem everywhere you have social housing and you don't have true property rights and you have politically correct police saying and people don't want to get tough with the problem because they're called racist or whatever and and they were talking and by the way Toronto has had more gun crime this year than New York what do you think of that that's amazing especially considered we've banned the guns I don't know why the criminals I mean we just need to double banned them or triple banned them and if that doesn't work we're gonna keep banning guns until the criminals get the message anyways so Mammal ad was talking how when you go to some of these parts and ride along with the cops they make you wear bulletproof vests or stab-proof vests because it's so dangerous it's a fact and there was one passage can we call up the passage could call that up I want to play it and I want to go about a minute before he says cockroaches because I want to prove because he asked a good question that Madeleine he was not calling the inhabitants of these social housing projects cockroaches of course not he was calling the Ganga's a that infests these places cockroaches and the media party has run with this but it's hot it's like they cut out the tape right before he said the words so they could lie about it it reminds me of when Donald Trump called the brutal satanic Ganga ms-13 when he called them animals and the media said you just called immigrants animals yeah no no he was calling this murderous gang tattoos on their faces they literally ritually kill people they literally are Satanists he was calling them animals and the media said no he called immigrants animals they're doing the exact same thing to George oh man lady we're gonna call up the clip and we'll play it from they just give me a signal ones ready and I'll play it for you to show the live you know I want to show that because I know that's a Toronto centric question but the lesson is more ubiquitous than that the lesson is you just can't trust a word the mainstream media has to say Tom young John two bucks says you saying Canadians aren't morally superior mm-hmm Canadians are morally superior than other countries in some other countries we were talking about that at the top you know I'm better than some cultures we believe the Equality of men and women we believe in the Equality of people regardless of what we don't believe in the supremacy of one religion over the others we believe in the separation of mosque and state we believe in nonviolent solutions to problems we believe in a whole bunch of things that make us culturally morally superior than and say the theocracy of Iran or Saudi Arabia to pick two that doesn't mean every individual Canadian is morally superior than any individual in those countries in fact often those individuals in those countries are the victims of their immoral culture their immoral government the gangs the theocracy so I'm not going to say that any individual Canadian is morally superior than anyone than any random person from any of the country no but the way we've arranged our affairs collectively is now I think that Canadians can take it too far patting themselves on the back there's a lot of anti-american sneering and that's what I was alluding to before we have our own ethnic dysfunction economically that we have to address social dysfunction and it's not urban blacks it's Aboriginal people and we have not solved those and all this fake holiday we'll do is be a placebo it doesn't solve the problems we still have an Indian Act in Canada that makes it illegal for Aboriginal people to own property on their own reserve did you know if you're an Indian living on an Indian Reserve in Canada you do not have the right to own your own house you can't sell it you can't mortgage it you can't buy it you don't even have the right to do your own last will and testament the Indian band gets to their final say over that if you're a farmer in some parts of Canada on an Indian band you need the government's permission before you're allowed to sell your products off the reserve the thinking when this law was written decades ago century ago whatever was that we can't trust Aboriginal people to make decisions on their own because they'll just be hornswoggled by some unscrupulous trader so we have to protect them as if they're children that law is still on the books while we're talking about bringing in a new holiday have a fix that law first are we ready with the Georgio mammal ad clip no all right let's abandon that's we missed the moment have we have I missed any super chance let me ask you that have any super chick no I think I've got them all all right it is 1233 we're halfway down the show let's keep going I'm going to read some some comments I'm just gonna read some regular comments if you want to put some super chats on there I'll see those right away Shane Moxxi is Ezra also Jewish yes am Steve karai if he's Iranian he's obviously a former he's now secular a Shia Muslim not sunni this also means according to their code that he can now be assassinated by any Muslim good troll brave well that's the thing is the punishment for apostasy in Islam is death apostasy is when you quit a religion you're not allowed to quit focus on Yahweh chips in five dollars Canadian thank you very much if you have a question you'd like to put to me feel free and I'll make sure to keep an eye peeled for it fast tines 39 says forest fires training day tonight in central BC yeah I saw I saw that that looks very ominous the forest fires there and I hope everybody stays safe I see for a to super chest from focus on Yahweh thank you very much for those you can also write a comment or a question and I will do my best to to answer it so feel free to do that I D Miha Lackey says what do you think of the three C's initiative I'm sorry I don't think I've heard of that I just I just don't know what that is so I can't answer let me read some more here Brian three nine three four well Bernier be removed talking about Maxine Bernier the Canadian politician a member of parliament from the Quebec who plays an extremely close second place - Andrew Shearer in the in the Tory leadership last year and the trouble is because it was so close and because Maxine Bernier in the last week is not actually done anything wrong he has uncontradicted party policy he has done attacked anyone in the party he's just criticized Justin Trudeau's obsession with that hollow phrase diversity is our strength how can andrew shear fire him for what cause for attacking a fellow Tory he's not he's attacked Justin Trudeau for contradicting party policy why by saying there's such a thing as too far too much diversity it's not really a party policy might be totally something the party doesn't love but I think most consumers would agree with that I think couple more super chats Tom young John why is Israel so damn important what's important to the people who live there it's important to people around the world who have a religious connection Christian's to the birthplace and where Jesus lived Jews that's where Mount Zion is is where the Jewish temples were that's where the modern Jewish state is and it is also the third holiest place for Islam after Mecca and Medina so there's a religious answer it's a political answer - it's a western-style liberal democracy in the region with it's just all dictatorships it's a proxy for military battles I mean in 1980s for example the new generation of American fighter jets f-15s and f-16s fought against Russian fighter jets of the Syrians in the Bekaa Valley and I think going from memory they shot down 80 Syrian jets with no losses it's really a proxy war it was during the Cold War between East and West so it's not just itself it's all swimming to this day Iran has its proxies in Syria Russia is in Syria America is allied with Israel America was with the others just some of so many other fingers in it so that's my attempt at an answer there I see another Super chant here Colin Buckley well done the rebel for reporting real news UK News has done any updates on Tommy yeah I suppose it saw me this morning in fact I mean there was a while I was talking to him every day I'm not calling him every day now because he's still on holiday with his family I see though and I was talking about it this morning that a reporter for The Daily Daily News went there and went to the island where Tommy's on vacation like flew there just to take photos of Tommy and his family and Tommy detected the sky very quickly wasn't just one guy there was like a team in them and taught me a cost of the guys said why are you endangering my fan like why are you taking photos of my wife and kids why are you exposing them and and Tommy as usual film that on this phone and he uploaded that to his YouTube page you can find it there and the story is on the Daily Mail it's already there I I saw pictures of Tommy yeah tommy was in prison for two and a half months they went on a holiday with his family to reconnect with them and he went off the coast of Spain that's it was actually a holiday he had booked a long time ago and he got out of prison two days before the holiday began talk about great timing so they went to why I don't know why that's newsworthy really I don't quite know the thinking there what's interesting to me is how the UK media especially the tabloid media obsess about Tommy as much as anyone but for some reason they haven't gotten around to writing yet about his amazing court of appeal victory that vindicated him and condemned the legal system for some reason they haven't gotten around to writing about his torture in prison I say torture advisedly he was physically and psychologically abused in prison so though they'll fly imagine the money of flying a whole team to a hotel in the Canary Islands finding him like scouring the whole island finding him and then taking pictures of his wife and kids what is that is that a $10,000 exercise $20,000 why it's they're just weird the creepy obsessive stalkers let me catch up here a little bit Rutger hoe Dyke says shut up and take my money that's very nice you to say I won't shut up though because other people want to hear me Yap for at least 20 minutes Bill Hicks 7 Australian dollars thank you Bill feel free to make a comment Ingrid Warner five dollars Canadian hey Ezra what are your thoughts about Tesla suing the Ontario government well to explain for our viewers who don't know the background and I haven't read the lawsuit I just read the headlines in Ontario as part of some greens Skeen some virtue signaling the government of Ontario would give a massive subsidy to anyone who bought an electric car and there are some electric cars that are around 40 50 thousand dollars there I mean I guess the Prius is certainly gets us some sort of a rebate I think but the pure electric cars like the Tesla would get rebates and going from memory here of up to $14,000 I'm going from memory so that might be wrong forgive me from a little bit wrong there we go Elon Musk versus Doug Ford Tesla Foss lawsuit against Ontario government over electric vehicle rebate program Tesla claims it was explicitly excluded from Ontario's rebate transition plan leaving many buyers short fourteen thousand okay so I was right on the number there I'll just read the first sentence Elon Musk Tesla Motors Canada has filed a lawsuit against the Ontario government alleging it was a subject of unjustified targeting when the province cancelled its electric vehicle rebate program last month the automaker claims the government decision left hundreds of customers in eligible for rebates they expected to receive when they or their vehicles blabbity blah mismanage before the courts he's playing if you want it Tesla's are very expensive like they're extremely expensive and not just that the people who buy them they're rich and not just that there's snooty snobs rubbing it in the face of their neighbors it's not it's you know I used to have a neighbor in Toronto who had two tiny little windmills on his run his roof it was they were so lame because that's not gonna power anything and every morning when I would take my kids get him in the car and go to school it's a kids look at those windows are they spinning or no every morning because I would see these stupid emails and most of the time they weren't and I would always show my kids that because the point is it's just a virtue signal this guy with the windows also had solar panels it's snowy it's cloudy they were not designed to work they were designed so everyone on the street would know that this guy was morally superior he spent I don't know 50 grand under grandeur more on this whole roof thing that I know didn't work and when it worked Full Tilt it was probably only saving him a few dollars it was not an economic investment it was not an electrical investment it was not a true investment of any sort other than in showing the neighborhood that he was better than us now the Tesla could be cool I've never driven one it could be fun to drive so there could be a non-virtue sibling reason to buy a Tesla I'm skeptical I think it's like being a vegan or on a gluten-free diet I think that it's almost like a law if you have a Tesla you have to tell someone within the first five minutes of meeting them or you break the first rule of the Tesla Club which is it's the opposite of Fight Club first rule the Fight Club don't talk about Fight Club first of all the Tesla Club is if you don't tell someone within five minutes you've got a Tesla they take it back so you've got these rich snobs who aren't saving any electricity who are spending 80 90 100 grand on a Tesla and they want Joe lunch bucket on the assembly line to pay taxes to give them a $14,000 credit tell you what Richard signal on your own money that's the whole point that's all probably take your own money and if you want to spend it on a vanity project to show your neighbors how better you are than that don't expect them to pay for it that's that's the rub it's you know and I'm sure that I subsidize my neighbor's stupid windows I'm sure of it Alan Ansel I asked you a while back about making a rebel flag I got a couple made up and I'm flying one I'd like to send you him where would I send him well that's very nice a rebel flag can you guys Google our Eglinton Dufferin p.o box you know at the bottom of our you I think our address is on our website it's at the Eglinton Dufferin post office can you find that and I put it up on the screen or something or even you know Alan thank you very much by the way I don't know our mailing address offhand it's supposed to there it is no wait the button there is ya p.o box 6 105 6 Eglinton Dufferin ro toronto on to that so thank you yes please I'd love to see a flag that's great chicken permission 105 says the MSM and other leftists are afraid of you not of who you are but what you do and what you do but of who you can be and what you're capable of well thank you that's very hopeful way of phrasing things and thank you for the pie bucks sometimes we're very very good and sometimes we're not as good as we should be and that's because we're flawed human beings and we're amateurs and we're sort of doing this and the psych cap you know at phrase I remember when we launched the rabble literally one day one business day after the Sun News Network folded talked about building an airplane as you're taxing down the runway I mean we started with no money other than the severance that we got from the Sun we started with no equipment we started with nothing and we just did it and we're sort of being trying to catch up ever since I mean there's about five major things I would change the rebel if I could ever catch our breath improvements I would make positions I would hire for if we had the dough but I've been saying that for three and a half years if I have the dough I'd do this if I had the dough I do that but we just don't have the dough I'm like there's this fake news site called press progress they're they're a branch plan of the NDP there's a there's other fake news sites out there me obviously so there's the government broadcaster fake news site called the CBC massive they get 1.5 billion dollars a year there's how the corporate side Vox I didn't know that Vox was partly owned I think it's by NBC who put in hundreds of millions of dollars so we're sort of the opposite of that aren't we like we have to make our money in dribs and drabs that's why we're that's why we're selling lapel pins for 50 bucks that's how we do it that's why outs Jones sells vitamins I mean laugh if you like but how else are supposed to get money especially if YouTube Facebook Google Twitter shut you down pastor Tsinghua I'm calling the RCMP Ezra if you take that flag or that glad I think you probably meant flag alright go ahead recycled Hart DM Ezra do you support faith Goldie in her run for mayor of Toronto no I don't and I haven't felt the need to weigh in on it because I think her candidacy is very marginal I'd be surprised if she gets 5% of the vote I don't think it's a serious campaign I think it's a Twitter vanity project I don't think she has a campaign office she's just a mailbox in the post office like we do I don't even know she has campaign manager it's just a Twitter campaign with a website and so I don't think it's serious to begin with I don't think it's built to win I don't think that she has the track record of you know one would look for in a mayor she has to run as a city councillor she doesn't know all the issues I mean her I've been to her website and I've read her points and you know I you know they're great little editorial talking points but it's a mean campaign so it's it's a I'd probably call it a stunt in a good way like I'm not against stunts we do plenty of stunts here at the rebel it's a virtual campaign I mean she decided to run after taking a Twitter poll what does that even mean I mean how many of those poll results weren't even from Toronto now I've been asked why don't you cover her campaign well we will cover her campaign as we would cover any other news but running a vanity campaign that's not immune again five percent that's not news by definition there are a lot of vanity candidates who are running just for fun just for some PR and we wouldn't cover them we don't even covering the Toronto Mayor ASIS wouldn't even be a big thing for us anyways I mean Stan's biggest city but it's not a defining political battle for this country so I don't think we've covered to begin with and of course there's the matter that we sacked faith for and that doesn't mean we wouldn't cover her I mean we have fired other people in the past and we there's some people we don't get along with great we still report on them if they're doing something legit but and if faiths were somehow to get some momentum or were somehow to to catch on fire with actual Torontonians I'm sure we would cover it but to cover a vanity Twitter campaign with no boots on the ground now it would be tantamount to being a PR wing for because it's not real it's not real and it wasn't it was not conceived in any real or serious way it was you know the latest thing from faith and you know I mean I like I've talked to her twice I think since she left us and I I hope I hope she has a happy future and gets on the right track I don't think doing a kamikaze run for mayor where she's going to get 5% at best is is the right path like but I don't want to indulge in gossip I think you asked a legitimate question and I think I gave a legitimate answer faith was my favorite employee absolutely and she was a great reporter and a great team player here until at that last shocking moment where she went on a neo-nazi broadcast kept it secret from me for most of the week told me only when it was about to be revealed in the national newspaper and we just can't abide that so we let it go for that we fire her I had hoped that she could amend and come back but she doesn't want to I wish her no ill will I just were not going to cover a vanity campaign that's going to get a few percent and I don't even think she'd be a good mayor if she won because she has no management skills she has no experience I mean it would be like saying Esther do you want to be Prime Minister well maybe as a dream babe I'm not a cabinet minister I've never been an MP take someone and put them in the top job it's not right I mean we see what happens with Justin Trudeau who actually had a term or two as an MP first so it's it's a joke and in campaign and what can I say you know I'm gonna I'm gonna stop criticizing because I don't mean to over criticise Christopher Chung what's your take on Alex Jones being banned well I've had a lot to say about it I've done several shows on it if you want to see those I think that Alex Jones is a bit of a wild man he's very very entertaining I've probably watched in my entire life maybe two hours worth of his stuff I see him more in memes he's very mean the bull he's very funny he's got a lot of stick he's got a lot of sayings he's got a stye guy that gravelly voice I showed you the other day I think was last week I showed you his genuine journalism when he went to Bohemian Grove check out our battleground from last week I don't want to play the clip again but he actually sneaked in to a secret society and their bizarre pagan rituals and burning effigies it was bloody weird so he's a he's a real journalist sometimes he's an entertainer tongue sometimes he's a universal Omni skeptic which can lead him to indulge in conspiracy theories sometimes seriously sometimes not I think he's just an entertainer sometimes and that's legit and I think banning him is how absolutely outrageous banning him while genuine violence you put up that tweet that that I showed I think today yesterday Alex this is a tweet that has not been banned from Twitter it's against ice you know what I stands for that's the American immigration enforcement so this is a Twitter account called proud bulb Bulba and you can see it's been up there since June 19th so July August has been up there for two months how does sabotage ice film them whenever possible that's fine pour sugar a new cement to prevent it from setting what's that going to do they pour bleach in ice vehicle gas tanks knife those effing eye tires put a potato way up in that exhaust pipe if you smash glass do it last and then there's more get out in your communities so it's but but go back to that top one for a second four thousand five hundred and sixty three wheat retweets twelve thousand nine hundred and fifty likes so this is not suspended on Twitter and this is just one random example you know the Hamas website has been online since 2009 that's a terrorist group the Ikhwan website or maybe Hamas is three years old one of the two the Muslim Brotherhood has been online since 2009 I think it's verified could you go to a Quan web I K Hwa and it's the Muslim Brotherhood it's it's shocking the Muslim brother you know I'm talking about their the affiliate of Hamas terrorist group it's got a blue checkmark the Muslim Brotherhood called the Ikhwan has a blue checkmark on Twitter they're not just okay in social media they're verified but Alex Jones some alien conspiracy joke we must all delete him all youtube google facebook spotify Apple LinkedIn Pinterest all within 12 hours he's been online for almost 20 years and within 12 hours all this company individual yeah it Quan web that's the one DC they joined on May 2009 they're based in Cairo so they say they're actually illegal in Egypt official Twitter of the Muslim Brotherhood you see that on the left there it Quan well you see that blue checkmark this is they got 141 thousand followers this is not just the Muslim Brotherhood this is verified this has been up there for nine and a half years almost over nine years isn't that amazing okay I got a catch up I got to catch up on the super chance holy cow its 12:55 Fraser McBurney as we check your mail on Monday I sent you a present with your favorite saying oh okay thank you I'll do that v6 knew Tommy Robinson Channel video Tommy Robinson destroys daily mail journalist yeah that's what I was referring to Tommy spotted this photographer stamping pictures of his family Tom young John $2 Ezra you'd be so much better than Trudeau well essentially to say and we all daydream about if I was Prime Minister I'd do this but I was I'm getting really serious if you had to actually sit in that chair and make those decisions every day could you do it I've had a little bit of management experience in my life I mean the rebel we've got 30 odd staff or whatever and I I run a magazine I used to run a magazine called the Western standard at our height we had about 50 people mainly in the call centre so I've run some things I wouldn't Sam you know Warren Buffett or Donald Trump in terms but but you just can't go from Twitter pundit to mayor of a major city I'm sorry you can't do that it'll be a disaster it's not even serious let me make sure I'm all caught up I think I am we still have three minutes I'm not going to get into any other video clips or anything because there's only a few minutes I'll read some more some tweets to do Patrick Max Israeli billionaire controls most London Ontario real estate Shmuel far he I just don't believe that I'm a skeptic of that um Theseus nine pretty fair analysis of Alex Jones look I like the guys vivace I like his breel though I like everything is he says of course you know how can you know it's it's not you're not meant to like everything he says John Zealand AJ is right about China and Google yeah that's the thing it's not funny you got a conspiracy theorist and they take him out through a conspiracy and by that I mean Apple Google you to Twitter Facebook Linkedin Pinterest all on the same day within 12 hours they all at the same time say oh he violated their Terms of Service yeah it's enough to make a conspiracy theorist say yeah I may be paranoid but they are out to get me Gina Wonder Woman Ezra I will leave now because of what you said about vegans I accept that Gina ss mine fear the Jews are the main problem in this world no and and that's so stupid and I'm not surprised that you don't use your real name because that's that's apropos of nothing that's stupid and that's just an insult is hip Godspeed my friend may the wind be at your back thank you Aussie Bear Canadia needs Stephen Harper Australia needs Tony Abbott I'd agree with that yeah I'd agree with both of those part mmm Nigel Ezra would be a good guest on BBC question time hey when I was in the UK a couple weeks ago for Tommy's appeal I went on a couple of BBC shows they're awful I went on oh boy I've just forgotten their names Eddie somebody and I went on Nikki Sun but I love the names Eddie and Nikki and they're just so bad like I thought the Canadian media party was bad and they're so much worse than Canada and we're worse than America the BBC is the worst broadcaster in the world that is not literally owned by a dictatorship it's a state broadcaster of course but even RT which is the state broadcaster one of the state broadcasters from Vladimir Putin at least it's interesting at least is flavorful the BBC is so bad it's so scold II so terrified a political incorrectness it was unbelievable folks were out of time here I have enjoyed the banter I think Nicky Campbell thinks I see John wake you reminding me of some of the names I didn't sure you can find those interviews online I don't know what you think about him I thought it gave us good as I got we're out of time I enjoyed this and some personal talk people always ask you know I don't avoid the tough questions you know and I read some of the stupid anti-semitism just to knock it down you're asking me a tough question about faith I don't think I revealed anything that was a private or confidential matter I'm just giving my honest talk about her Twitter campaign and frankly I wish her all the best and Anna Anna Vanity campaign for mayor is not the best folks that's it for now until our show tonight at 8 p.m. on behalf of all of a secret rebel world headquarters thanks for joining us goodbye and keep fighting for freedom you
