the left defends ante foe we talk about Confederate statutes and why we're really talking about Confederate statues and we talk about the Republican response to everything Trump related I'm ben shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so if possible everything is worse yesterday I left the show by saying can we have a good day apparently no one listened so they decided to have an incredibly crappy day well done everyone just a great jump around we're going to talk today a lot about why the Left seems to now be defending violence why does it NT Phi has to be turned into heroes why that was their ultimate goal in the first place also we'll talk about Confederate statues should they be removed Confederate monuments why are we even talking about Confederate monuments what the goals are of the various political sides and even discussing this and we'll go through the various arguments for and against keeping them so it seems that the left had an ulterior motive when it comes to the events in Charlottesville I don't mean that they organized the events in Charlottesville with an intent toward what happened to that that innocent young woman or that it's their fault they went their encounter protested an evil white supremacist movement and spare me all the talk about how there were lots of wonderful people at the at the evil white supremacist movement the thing was pitched as an white supremacist rally okay that's just the way that it was okay but it is clear that one of the goals of the left and it has been for now a year and Charlotte's will allowed them to do this with some level of credibility is they are now attempting pretty overtly to legitimize the antifoam movement the antifa movement is a deeply violent movement that seeks to use violence against all the people they oppose and the media have basically covered up the level of violence that Antipa is engaged in so yesterday we got news that another rally in Richmond Virginia where a bunch of antique shop there was a journalist who really got clocked we have a couple of pictures what happened to that journalist so here is a picture of the journalist after the journalist clocked by an MTF a member and here is another picture of the journalist head after the journalist was clocked by the mt4 member for staples in the head concussion from the antifa member this was not covered in any real way by the media more broadly they basically suggested that none of this sort of stuff happened that when Trump said that the alt left was charging into people that was that was not true again it was true okay what Trump said there was true he said some things during that press conference that really I thought were quite upsetting morally but that was not one of them when he went after the what he called the all left by which he meant Antipa he was exactly right to do so and Tifa is a violent vile and you're seeing this unfortunately this notion spread around the country then n Tifa violence against Nazis is okay we have this conversation a while back when Richard Spencer who is a neo-nazi white supremacist was punched in the head and a lot of people on the Left celebrated yay Richard Spencer was punched in the head and I said at the time I think Richard Spencer is vile but you can't punch Nazis in the head we live in a civilized country hey you shouldn't be punching people in the head this is why we have police ideally it means one thing to defend yourself it's a full another thing to to go somewhere with the intent of engaging in violence but the left seems now ensconced in this idea there were two washington post op eds in the course of 48 hours basically endorsing and Tifa so one of them was from a professor named NDB Connelly of Johns Hopkins University and he wrote an entire piece called Charlottesville showed that liberals that liberalism can't defeat white supremacy only direct action can in other words we can't have votes we can't have conversations we can't have debate no only white supremacy the own white supremacy can only be defeated by throwing what he calls rocks and this is seriously what do you rate your rights liberalism paper preserves our country's long commitment to contract under liberalism citizens stand in contract with their government the government's job in turn has been to enforce contracts between individuals and groups but Connolly continues white supremacy represents our culture scissors there have been people historically cut out of our social contract but there is a rock right it's rock paper scissors there is a rock resistance okay resistance is the rock and he says rocks can look like armed self-defense or nonviolent direct action campaign well those are not the same thing at all in non-violent direct action campaigns like boycott that's not the same thing as punching somebody in the head or throwing rocks he goes on to talk about why violence is okay so in April 1968 I made a flurry of other rocks riots shook American cities following the assassination of Martin Luther King jr. it took that rolling unrest not the promise that further economic growth to spur President Lyndon Johnson in Congress to action within a week they had passed the Fair Housing Act remember the past century liberalism vexed by an ever sharp ever cutting white supremacy has needed these rocks so riots are necessary so burning down Detroit burning down Los Angeles and Watts riot that was necessary and then he concludes segregationists have ass again assume their pedestals in the Justice Department the White House and many other American temporal temples hey by the way Jeff Sessions immediately called this a hate crime and said who's going to investigate this as a terrorist incidents that's just nonsense and when he says segregationist and the White House Trump isn't the segregationist okay I don't like what Trump said I've been very clear that I didn't like what Trump said on Tuesday or on Saturday I think Trump sometimes fellow travels with the alt-right because he thinks they're his friends but he's not a segregationist okay it connelly concludes paper alone won't drive them out start throwing rocks so overtly calling for violence overtly calling for violence in the streets in a country that is highly law-abiding where levels of violence are at their lowest levels on average in 50 years basically I mean this is this is really really vile stuff it's by the way it's also historically ignorance this is another point I think worth making right in America have not forwarded the cause riots in America I have made the cause worse Detroit before the Detroit riots of 1967 1968 before those Detroit riots happen Detroit was the fastest-growing black city in America it was a an economic hub black families earned ninety five percent on average what white families earned in the city of Detroit desegregation was happening wholesale in Detroit housing was being desegregated in Detroit and then after the riots you got white flight people left the tax base eroded they raise taxes in order to take advantage of whatever smaller tax base was left more people left and that's how you hollow out a major city like Detroit rises on the same thing in LA LA is a highly segregated today I've lived my entire life here la is very very segregated South Central Los Angeles or South Los Angeles as they like to call it now is is very black and East LA is very Hispanic and Simi Valley is very white okay it's a very segregated city and one of the reasons is because of riots like the LA riots or as Maxine Waters that disgusting human being called them the LA uprising when black folks decided to many black folks had to burn their own neighborhoods and target Korean shopkeepers in in South Central over the Rodney King verdict okay riots throwing rocks is not a worthwhile thing in the United States again self-defense is one thing riots are not self-defense riots are not self-defense I'm not talking here about the lynch mob comes to get a black guy and he shoots them good for him more power to him that's why the NRA is useful okay but I'm talking here about what he's talking about the idea then Antipa needs to go out in the streets and if the Nazis are marching and people needs to go out and punch them in the head he's not the only person saying this mark Bray is a historian and lecturer at Dartmouth University and he's defending anti fight he was on MSNBC fully defending this this vile violent communist anarchist group how does how do far-right movements grow I say they grow by becoming normalized by not being confronted by being able to present themselves as family friendly and and respectable so part of the reason why the alt-right calls themselves alright is to present that mainstream image and the opposition that that equal people showed in Charlottesville really marred and tainted that so I think that by showing up and confronting it it prevents the ability of being able to be presented as mainstream and and connected that I think really you need to be able to to prevent them from being able to organize people who are involved in politics know that from movement to expand they need to be able to organize and grow and if you stop that it prevents it okay this is sure nonsense what he is saying here that people who engaged in violence with the Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville did the country of service absolute absolute crap this is he wrote in his piece that auntie fuh has been fighting Klansmen and fascists for years and then he specifically talks about how they helped stop Hitler except for how they didn't stop Hitler right he says in retrospect the anti fascist have concluded it would have much easier to stop Mussolini back in 1919 when his first fascist nucleus had 100 men or to stamp out the far-right German Workers Party which I had only 54 members when Hitler attended his first meeting before he transformed it into the National Socialist German Workers Party so he says that not just about it but he's saying they shouldn't just do this through education he says the first anti-fascist fought Benito Mussolini's black shirts in the Italian countryside exchanged fire with Adolf Hitler's brown shirts in the taverns and alleyways of Munich and defended Madrid from Francisco Franco's insurgent nationalist army how'd that go how'd that go all three of those times the bad guys won so how'd that go and I want to talk a little bit about this myth that that armed violence by communists in the bimah Republic would have stopped the Nazis there was armed violence by communists in the Weimar Republic it was one of the driving forces behind the Nazi success people looked at the Communists they said okay we have to decide between communist violence and fascist violence we'll go with the fascists it is from Richard Evans's book the coming of the Third Reich quote a graph that could counted the life of the committed communist activist during the Weimar Republic was later provided by the memoirs of richard krebs clashes with the police strengthened his hatred of them and their bosses the social democratic rulers of the city the communists refused to work with the social democrats says Krebs later described how committed communists would attend street demonstrations with pieces of lead piping in their belts and stones in their pockets ready to Pelt the police with I want to tell you the rest of this story and why it is that groups like NP file only grow the alt-right only grow the neo-nazis only grow the neo Confederates only grow the white supremacist but before I do that I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at brain bridge frame

another paramilitary battles were common by the way here are some statistics about the paramilitary battles in the aftermath of world war one the German army was essentially disbanded by the Versailles Treaty and there are a lot of ex-military people roaming around the Communists grab some of them and what we're called the Freikorps the FRA corpse grabbed FRA Corps grabs it grabs another and they form things like the steel helmets and the FRA Corps and these were all these were all militia groups basically local militia groups that wandered the countryside fighting each other and quote-unquote defending the population from the various entities from 1924 to 1929 it was claimed the 29 not the activists had been killed by communist communist reported 92 workers had been killed in clashes with fascists from 24 to 30 26 members of the steel helmets the steel helmets were sort of this this veterans group were said to have fallen in the fight against communism in 1930 the figures rose dramatically in the lead-up to the Nazis taking power this was a key factor in the rise of the Nazis in 1930 the figures rose dramatically the Nazis clintons have suffered 17 deaths rising to 42 in 1931 84 in 1932 remember 1932 is the year the Nazis essentially paved their way to power in 1932 the Nazis reported nearly 10,000 of their rank-and-file have been wounded in clashes with their opponents according mark Bray wouldn't that have stopped them and me obviously had armed resistance why didn't that stop them the Communists reported 44 deaths in fights at the Nazis in 1932 and 1931 75 in the first six months of 1932 alone in the number of dead in the year in the year to March 1932 a March 1931 was no no fewer than 300 dead in these various battles I mean serious serious stuff makes Charlottesville look like look like a pikers game the number of people who are dying in these meetings a communist would break up Nazi meetings in one meeting Krebs went and he broke up a Nazi speech by Hermann Goering right Garen would become the second in command to Hitler he said that he quote made sure that each man was armed the blackjack for brass knuckles a terrifying melee followed Blackjacks brass knuckles clubs heavy buckle belts glasses bottles were the weapons used Goering he stood currently on the stage his fist on his hips Evans reports scenes like this were being played out all over Germany in the early 1930s the Nazis made their money off these sorts of things if you want to make the alt-right more popular all you have to do is go out in the streets and fight them then they get to look tough they get to look like they win they get to look like they're victims at the same time like they're fighting a defensive battle when really what they're doing is promulgating an evil ideology again this is Richard Evans okay gurbles made his reputation above all as regional leader of Berlin where his fiery speeches his incessant activity his outrageous provocations of the Nazis opponent and his calculated staging of street fights and meeting hall brawls to gain the attention of the press won the party a mass of new adherents young disenchanted men who have nothing better to do with their lives are looking for movement to belong to and that will engage in violence and makes them feel tough it makes them feel special this is why you see you know Christopher Cantwell in that in that vice video talking about how many guns he carries and how he works out all the time and makes himself more ready for violence this is a thing okay and when NFL plays right into their hands not only are they doing something evil when they shut down normal conservatives they're doing something evil when they fight these Nazis in the streets with their fists okay that's why we have police in this country we have very able police in this country and the idea that we need an Tifa in the streets is some sort of grand and glorious mission is really disgusting it's a way of legitimizing a group that by the way is communist the anarchist and fights law-abiding people too not just white supremacists not just white supremacist but this is just in line with it's something that I think is really terrible because I think everyone is taking advantage of racial conflagrations like this they're they're taking advantage of hot points like this to promulgate an image of their opponents so the whole point this is why we're talking about conservatives Confederate statues rather so the reason that we're talking about Confederate statutes is become a major issue now because President Trump decided to make that an issue at his press conference a couple of days ago because the rally for the white supremacists took place around the robert e lee statue and because the left is now calling for stone mountain to be taken down and they're talking about how they need to get rid of various monuments all over the united states that include confederate figures or pre confederate figures so we need to ask ourselves why are we even having this conversation and I think it's worth recalling that in the aftermath of that evil piece of crap Dylann storm roof shooting 19 black people murdering 19 black people at a black church a historically black church Dylann storm roof there's a picture of him with a confederate flag and we had a whole national conversation about the confederate flag why is it that whenever somebody does something evil we immediately jump to try to find some divisive symbol that we can all rally around or against why is that we do that and I would suggest that it has very little to do with the symbol and a lot more to do with political gamesmanship it has a lot more to do with people trying to make political hay ok so let's start at the beginning here the controversy over Confederate statutes has been a hot-button issue for decades ok there are good arguments on both sides in a second I'm going to go through the arguments on both sides and what they mean and and whether they are worthwhile but the question is why in the aftermath of what we just saw in Charlottesville are we now talking about getting rid of all the Confederate statutes I mean like a year ago we got rid of all the Confederate flags supposedly and that obviously didn't tamp things down so why is that we keep going back to iconoclasm I kind of class and literally means taking down icons why is it or attempting to do that now why is that an important thing okay we're actually participating I think in a politically advantageous proxy argument the people who want to get rid of the statues want to label everyone who wants to keep the statues a member of the all-white right supremacists okay that's actually what they want to do so people who say if you want to keep the statute that's because you're white supremacists and then people who don't want to get rid of the statues they say in contrast that everyone who wants to get rid of the statues just wants to wipe away American history now there are people who back the Confederate statues who actually are white supremacists as we saw in Charlottesville and there are a lot of people on the Left who want to use the Confederate statues as a club issue and want to get rid of all of American history they wanna get rid of Jefferson in Washington and what Trump was saying is true there is a cadre of people who absolutely that is on their agenda but those aren't the real honest arguments about this particular Confederate statue or that particular Confederate statue all of this all of us can all this chaos all of this fighting all of it is being done in order to build particular movement so let's start with the outright why do they have their rally around the robert e lee statue in Charlottesville Virginia in the first place well they chose to protest the removal for two reasons one their actual white supremacists who find the arguments of the Confederacy attractive about the racial supremacy of whites to blacks okay but more importantly the real reason they did this is because they know that there are many non white supremacists right there are a lot of people who are not white supremacist who also oppose getting rid of the robert e lee statue on other grounds historic grounds cultural grounds the grounds that maybe this is a good opportunity to teach their children about the evils of slavery and the problems of confederacy and what the outright use these statues is rallying cry because they're trying to draw it closer to the normies right they're trying to say that normal people who don't wanna get rid of the statues by the way the polls show a vast majority of americans are not interested in getting rid of these statues including according to some polls the majority of blacks the idea that everyone wants to get rid of the statute is nonsense the alt-right knows this and so they pick a cause they think has a majority of support like let's not get rid of this robert e lee statue and then they rally around that opening to broaden their cause so the left reacts in exactly the flip-side way so just as with Dylann storm roof the left decides that it's very important now to label everyone who is their opponents a nazi right so everyone who opposes getting rid of these statues is now a member of the alt-right according to the left according to an antique fund the hard left there are no good people who believe this now it's not the same thing as what Trump said Trump said there were good people who went to that rally on Friday night I seriously doubt that but what the right is saying is that there are some good people who believe that you shouldn't get rid of the statute undoubtedly true the left is saying there are no good people then there are no good people who believe that you shouldn't get rid of the statue and it is the same thing with the Confederate flag the idea was anybody who flies a Confederate flag must be a redneck racist who wants to murder black people and it wasn't true then it's not true now and it's not fair about statues how about President Trump well President Trump also is acting out of political convenience so the left has now broadened the rubric of bad guys to include anybody who opposes getting rid of the leaf statue so Trump responds by defending anyone anyone who doesn't want statues of lead torn down as decent this is why he's tried to broaden out the argument right he's tried to say that not only are there a lot of decent people who don't want to get rid of the leaf statues but you know those people hang out with white supremacist on Friday night right that's the problem so everybody is now so it's the worst of all world you exactly all right trying to unite with the normies who don't want to get rid of the of the Confederate sketch and then you've got the left trying to unite the Normans with the alt-right by saying all of them don't want to get rid of the Confederates catch and then you have Trump saying saying on behalf of the normies well you know we're sort of on the same side as the alt-right we don't want to get rid of the Confederates caches and so we end up with is this very very polarized politics and you're seeing it on the left routinely and I think the left started this by by trying to use the Confederate statues as flashpoint and suggesting that everybody who wants to keep them is racist but I think that the right and the alt-right jumped on it and now the right is falling into the trap and I don't say that the right should get rid of the statues but I think that we should at least understand which arguments are really going on okay the arguments that are really going on or not the honest arguments I'm gonna talk about the honest arguments over Confederate statues in just a minute because there are honest arguments on both sides I really do see them okay I really do see the honest arguments on both sides and I'll tell you about them but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Beachbody on demand so you wouldn't know it to look at me but dude I'm chiseled okay I am just a monster and a lot of that is due to Beachbody on demand they have all the familiar brands the ones that you like p90x insanity 21 day fix Beachbody on demand gives you access unlimited access to a wide variety of highly

to go through a couple of the actual honest arguments with regard to the Confederate statues because the only reason we're having this debate in the first place is so everyone can demagogue it so they all right can demagogue it pretend that everybody who opposes them wants to wipe away American history and they are really just siding with the normal American you've got president Trump demagogue met by saying that there are lots of good people who opposed getting rid of the Confederate statues therefore a lot of the people on Friday night who are with these white supremacists are fine and then you have less demagoguing it by saying anyone who doesn't want to get rid of the Confederate statues is obviously an evil neo Confederate everyone's demagogue mean so let's talk about the actual arguments here so this morning president Trump tweets out three tweets on this and the first tweet he tweets excuse me in sweet sad to see the history and culture of our great country they ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments you can't change history but you can learn from it robert e lee's Stonewall Jackson who's next Washington and Jefferson so foolish also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparable irreplaceably making three arguments here the first argument is that statues of Confederate history should be left up to preserve our history and culture he's not the only one who's made this argument before Condoleezza Rice has made it from a slightly less from a slightly less positive point of view here's kind of Lisa rice making pretty much exactly that case I am a firm believer in keep your history before you and so I don't actually want to rename things that were named for slave owners I want us to have to look at those names and recognize what they did and be able to tell our kids what they did and for them to have a sense of their own history when you start wiping out your history sanitizing your country to make you feel better it's a bad thing okay so she's making the same case the Trump is making and I agree with this basic case I think this case is basically right that you leave the ugly parts of your history up so that people know about it and also it is worthwhile noting that there are a lot of people who are descendants of Confederate soldiers who see the monuments not as homage to slavery as homage to slavery but as homage as to people who thought they were defending their states from federal encroachment even if they were defending an evil cause in the process right so I think there's a little bit more complexity than just everyone who likes the Confederate statues is a racist bigoted sexist homophobe okay and I think that Connie makes a good case and I think the case there is is relatively strong what's undercutting that case is the white supremacists actively doing what the left thinks most of America thinks about the Confederates so I make that clear let's believe that most Americans think that these statutes should staff because they're racist the actual reason that white supremacists want the statutes stay up is because they're racist so it's it's hard it's a serious problem that the white supremacists are taking and using these symbols as rallying points it's really quite demoralizing I guess the second argument that Trump makes is the slippery slope argument this is actually trump strongest argument is one that he made on on Tuesday he said that the left wants to wipe away all vestiges of American history right they want to get rid of Washington they want to get rid of Jefferson this is certainly true okay there are members of the left who want to do this there's already talk Alton is talking about how he wants to get rid of statues people are talking about changing the name of Washington DC even though that as I mentioned yesterday University of Missouri there was a strong push to get rid of statues of Thomas Jefferson in fact I showed you video from that I showed you video from that vice documentary about what happened in Charlottesville and one of the things that happened is there was a black woman who was talking and she said Thomas Jefferson's house it's up there on that hill the slave masters house it's up there on that hill and we should get you know that's just another monument that's Charlottesville okay so the idea that this stops with robert e lee is not true it will go back to Thomas Jefferson no question now it doesn't have to it doesn't have to and if we were logical I think there's a fairly strong case for getting rid of monuments to Lee but keeping monuments to Thomas Jefferson the case for getting rid of the monument to lead but keeping the cave but keeping the one for Thomas Jefferson is that number one robert e lee himself opposed building monuments to Confederate soldiers because he thought that it would prevent unity which apparently he was right but second robert e lee was fighting for a rebel cause to break away from the Union George Washington was fighting to uphold the Union the question when you build the monument is what are you celebrating when you build a monument to MLK you are not celebrating MLK's sexual peccadilloes right when when you build a monument to MLK you're celebrating his message on race relations when you build a monument to George Washington you're not celebrating a slaveholding you're celebrating his actions in the Revolutionary War in his establishment of the Constitution and his presidency right these are the things you're celebrating monuments celebrate causes not just the people who are on the monuments and so that's how you distinguish them right so Lee was for the rebellion what are you celebrating when you celebrate Lee right maybe maybe you're making the case that you're celebrating a man who honorably thought that he was fighting for states rights even though he opposed slavery and or apparently supposed labor and was and after he lost the war was was instrumental in trying to rally the country around the common point again maybe that's what the monument is for but that's a conversation worth having there's no question when you have a Jefferson Memorial for example that that is not a monument to Jefferson's affair with Sally Hemings that is a monument to to Jefferson being the father of the Declaration of Independence clearly that's what the monument is for so you don't have to engage in the slippery slope the difference between slippery slope arguments people get this wrong all the time this is the difference between slippery slope arguments and application of principle arguments a slippery slope argument says if you allow them to do a then they'll do B if you allow them to do B then they'll do see an application of principle argument like for example the argument that gay marriage will lead to polygamy that's not actually a slippery slope argument the argument there is that same-sex marriage redefines marriage as people who love each other polygamy can also be people who love each other so you're applying the same principle and you're just filling out what that principle means right so that's not the same thing as a slippery slope argument this is an actual slippery slope argument if you allow them to take leave then they will also take Jefferson in Washington unfortunately it's a true argument as the left is showing everyday and Trump is not wrong about all of this now get to the third argument that Trump makes in just a second but for that you're going to

nation Oh okay so the third argument that Trump makes with regard to these Confederate statues is that the statues are aesthetically pleasing this is a very dumb argument so this is the worst of his arguments that we'll never be able to beautify our parts again if we don't have a statue of Nathaniel Bedford Forrest I'm pretty sure it'll be okay I'm pretty sure we'll begin that that's not a particularly good argument I think there's an argument for some of them like I think that stone mountain is an amazing Monument I mean just aesthetically it's an amazing thing I mean they carved these giant monuments into a mountain that's pretty incredible but I don't think that you know some of the some of these statues that exist on street corners that nobody's looked at in 40 years I don't think that those are that's a very weak case as opposed to the case that you see from a lot of a lot of people on the Left which i think is a fair case or they say hey I'm a black taxpayer and I don't feel like paying for somebody polished the shoes of Nathaniel Bedford Forrest I think that's totally fair I think it's a totally fair argument so those are arguments we can have though right I mean I'm just presenting you all the argument those are arguments we can have we're not going to have any of those arguments we're going to stand in our various corners and scream at each other because that's what politics has become outstandingly in the corners screaming at each other the fringes getting West fringy the fringe is getting more violence and things getting worse I think that unfortunately Charlottesville may be the beginning rather than the end which is which is terrifying in its own right between an Tifa and and the alt-right just wow I think things are moving in the wrong direction okay I mean while President Trump is trying to recover from the foolishness of holding a press conference that was completely counterproductive he his business counsel basically resigned on him and the CEO of IBM presented a letter saying we disbanded Business Council he wrote team by now you've heard the news we have disbanded the president's strategy in policy form in the past week we have seen and heard of public events and statements that run counter to our values as a country and a company IBM has long said and more importantly demonstrated its commitment to a workplace in a society that it's open inclusive and provides opportunities to all then they denounce Charlottesville's and then they say we have worked with every US president since Woodrow Wilson we are determining lean on partisan and we have always believed dialogue is critical to progress that's why I joined the president's forum earlier this year this group can no longer serve the purpose for what was formed we agreed to disband the group okay so they agreed to disband the group so Trump tweets out that you can't you can't quit you're fired it's an I'm ending the counselor says rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the manufacturing council and strategy and Policy Forum I'm ending both thank you all mmm okay when they when they issue a letter like who do you believe you think Trump disbanded the forum or do you think the the people who are the CEOs were going to leave and then Trump disbanded the forum or they decided to disband it themselves none of this is good apparently Trump is very proud of himself for this press conference Steve Annan is very proud of him for this press conference because he feels like finally we get down to the the root of the battle finally we get down to the identity politics battle in fact Steve said that directly to the New York Times you said the lots been engaging in identity politics for a while let them continue to do that and we'll just play off of that it's not a good thing the President of the United States should not be celebrating the rise of identity politics on the left even though it's destroying the left I don't think you should be celebrating that you should be fighting it with every tooth and nail in his body every bone in his body should be fighting that with instead I think that he's engaging with it I am apparently Trump was telling people that he has no regrets I think that he should actually get the tattoo that says no regrets it's like should at this point have some regrets about about what state you see the country and and obviously this is not all trump's fault it was like this before Obama had exacerbated racial tensions to a tremendous degree look at the Gallup polls but this is definitely not helping Bandhan by the way seems to be in trouble Bandon did that he did an interview with The American Prospect he called up a guy at the American Prospect which is a very far left organization and began ranting to him about globalists like Gary Cohn and he started yelling about Trump's North Korea policy saying there's no chance we're going to joining military in North Korea obviously and and then the guy printed it and so bandhans been trying to backtrack ever since I think the greatest part of this particular story is that clearly whatever disease the mood chad is infectious it is a contagious disease the mood calls up a reporter forgets to say it's off the record and then apparently ban and says he did the exact same thing not smart but Bandhan maybe on the skids the easiest thing for Trump to do right now by the way is fire abandoned and then say listen I have to disassociate from all these people they're really bad is from going to do that I'm skeptical I'm skeptical maybe he fires Bannon but I don't think that he trump is a guy who always doubles down always doubles down and that means that if you know he's bluffing you should definitely play poker with him because he will just continue to double down he'll go all-in on nothing he'll go all-in not even a pair of two's he'll go all-in on you know two seven offsuit it's really it's an unfortunate tendency it's for Republicans in a weird position so the left has been saying a lot of people in the media been saying when do the Republicans disassociate when do they turn on Trump Jeffrey Toobin for example on CNN he says Republicans are just reminded of yuqing him when will they really turn on him know if we're talking about whether you can function as president of the United States and he can certainly function because the Republican Party is not going to abandon him Mitch McConnell said he was upset you know I'm upset when I can't find a good parking place I mean it is the mildest kind of rebuke do you think Mitch McConnell is not going to fight for tax reform now do you think that the Republican Party is going to stop trying to disenfranchise African Americans like it's doing all over the country because Donald Trump said something bad this is what the Republican Party's stand me you want to know why the Republicans aren't abandoning Trump because what the left means by abandoning Trump is not a thing I keep hearing this that I'm hearing this actually from some people with whom I largely agree on politics saying you know that if you call balls and strikes on Trump then you're doing it wrong because you just have to disassociate totally from Trump it's not a matter of just how do you disassociate from a human being like what does that mean just like never talk to me I don't talk to Trump now what does it mean to disassociate from him I can't say I can't support anything he does ever I have to I have to yell at every single thing he does like this is clearly what the media would like Chuck Todd says that Republicans have to call out Trump they're not doing it enough but I'll tell you how on earth is the party going to confront this crisis if it's unwilling to stand up against the person who arguably instigated it we invited every single Republican senator on this program tonight all 52 we asked roughly a dozen House Republicans including a bunch of committee chairs and we have roughly a half dozen former Republican elected official none of them agreed to discuss this issue with us today so who's going to step up the president has lost his moral authority for now and in the process he's tried to destroy or discredit everyone else's have all of our elites lost their moral authority or are they afraid to find out that the answer might be yes okay so and this is it this is the pitch of the media's that every Republican ought to be coming out and yelling about this okay so number one there are some of us who have been yelling about this right I mean like I've obviously been very exercised over president Trump's failures to disassociate from the from the all right however what the left really wants and this is why I think you're seeing fewer Republicans who are resonating to what the left wants the left is not intellectually honest about what they want okay the like I don't know what they're talking about they say high-level Republicans won't say anything right here's years Ronda McDaniels he's the head of the RNC and she's directly addressing white supremacists and I think this is right well the president condemned the white supremacist and the KKK and the neo-nazis unequivocally it took 48 hours we're going to do that but he did it and he should have and he did and our party has across the board said this is unacceptable we have no place in our party at all for KKK anti-semitism race racism bigotry it has no place in the Republican Party there is no home here we don't want your vote we don't support you will speak out against you the president has said so the vice president leaders across our party this is the beginning of what needs to be a longer conversation we are seeing this rhetoric ramped up we are seeing more violence and we need to take a stand against you okay so obviously everybody is willing to condemn alikes problems why won't they condemn Trump why won't they when will they speak Trump's name because they understand and this is really one of the problems with political partisanship I'm willing to say the President Trump did something wrong except I think he did something wrong here but what you are seeing is that what the left really wants is they think that you have not condemned from strongly enough unless you embrace their agenda that's really what they want Jeff Sessions who's Crump's Attorney General he came out immediately and said this could be a civil rights violation or a hate crime right it's not enough here's what session said I don't think we should just feel like we've got to do it in a matter of hours or days this investigation is ongoing around the country it could be 2:45 a civil rights Val nation title 18 to 45 or to 49 which is a hate crime and there might be other charges that could be brought ok so he's obviously taking the thing very seriously but the left actually want and this is why you're seeing there's a poll today that said 67% of Republicans approve of Trump's response that's because once again when you poll Republicans about what they think of Trump you're really pulling them about what they think of the media when you pull Republicans about what what they think of Trump they're actually responding to what they think of the media because they know the media are asking them a question and they think the ulterior motive of the media is to destroy Trump and by proxy to destroy the Republican policy and governing agenda so when people say sure I support how Trump handled charlotte's though it doesn't necessarily mean they actually like how Trump handled charlottesville many of them probably in the in the privacy of their own homes and when they discuss what their Republican friends are not particularly happy with what Trump did with charlottesville but they're not going to tell that to a pollster from the Washington Post instead what they're going to say is fine it's you against Trump I'm with Trump because that that's the way that the left has drawn the battle lines and that's the way the right has responded by drawing the battle lines so instead of the here's the way a normal conversation should go right the left says Trump did something wrong here and the right says yes Trump did something wrong here and left says good we all agree but that's not how the conversation goes what happens the left says Trump did something wrong here and the right says yes Trump did something wrong here or they prepare to say that and then lessons you know what even if you say Trump did something wrong here you still agree with him because you want to pass this tax agenda and so what this leads to is sort of a game of chicken is written prisoner's dilemma as I've explained a game there's more of a prisoner's dilemma where the best option for both sides the dominant strategy for both sides is to fall into the trap of defending their man so if you're a Republican and you know that the Democrats next step is to say even if you condemn it you're still a racist and you say fine I'm just not going to condemn it I know what your real agenda here is your real agenda it's your slander mate so screw you I'm not engaging that's what these polls are actually showing I don't think the polls are showing the Republicans are racists or bigots I think what the polls are actually showing is the Republicans hate the media and so they are unwilling to answer the questions of the media honestly I really think that's what it comes down okay so time for a quick thing I like anything I hate there are enough Big Ideas today so we won't do Big Idea Thursday so things I like I just I couldn't stop laughing at this last night so last night I went to a ball game and my white socks who are 50 games under 500 we're playing the Dodgers who are 50 games over 500 and the White Sox were winning and they were winning 4-2 - they have a new young guy named Nicky Delmonico's just a terrific player I hit two home runs in the game and a single and he was playing a terrific terrific Y field and just great player everything was going swimmingly and then my dad and I know that the wheels are going to come off so we leave at the bottom of the eighth-inning and naturally the wheels do come off and the Dodgers win 5-4 so that was I had lots of fun at the game it was it was nice there were a couple of people who tweeted so that I was at the game tweeted where I was so I did some pictures that was fun so hello all of you who are listening who were at the game last night but the best baseball moment was not just me and my dad at the game last night which was a blast the best baseball moment of yesterday was the worst first pitch ever this is an amazing first pitch and this I guess happened at the Red Sox game pretty incredible I mean you got to give credit to this guy this is this is hard to do so if you can't see it dude is throwing out the first pitch and nickels we got right in the nads just a bit outside suggestive inside man that is not a good first pitch I'm not sure who threw that first pitch but kudos to him for bringing America together again he's making America great again I think with that first pitch he even tweeted I think the guys were tweeted who knew that America could begin the healing process with a with a fastball with testicles and so well done Red Sox first pitch guys okay now for the thing I hate so the thing I hate today is the thing that I've hated for many in many in many a months and that of course is John Mackay Tech a Raisin in the Sun a man who looks like the wanted receipt you left in your pocket and then sent it through the wash John Kasich the Governor of Ohio the most self-aggrandizing human being ever the person who single-handedly allowed Donald Trump to become the nominee of the party by refusing to get out and let us have an honest vote between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump in a latter part of the of the race he stayed in for no reason other than he's an egoistic moron and now he says he wants to primary Trump this is and so he's out there bashing Trump because he wants to primary Trump pathetic isn't it just pathetic listening to this and hearing these marchers think if you were a 8 9 or 10 year old getting ready to go to school like they are in Ohio and you happen to come from a Jewish family or you're african-american and you hear this kind of hatred and we know about bullying that goes on in the schools and what are we doing to our children and to not condemn these people who went there to carry out violence and to somehow draw some kind of equivalency to somebody else reduces the ability to totally condemn these hate group okay so um here's my problem okay my problem is not with some of the things that he's saying here but my problem is that John Kasich obviously has political and ambition and political agenda and that's what infuses all of this I mean it doesn't sound like an honest pay from Kasich Kasich has been criticizing for Trump but criticizing Trump over everything large and small and as I've said since the beginning of this administration you got to wait to turn the needle up to eleven four times when it deserves to be turned up to 11 John Kasich seems like a cynical manipulator the idea that he's going to run in the primaries against Trump is just idiotic okay if he runs in the primaries against Trump he'll get 20% of the vote maximum and it's and it's largely because most of the people who oppose Trump opposed him from the right not from the left and Kasich is coming at him from his left so that's not going to be helpful at all John Kasich you egotist it is largely your fault the Donald Trump won the nomination in the Republican Party in the first place and then here you are doing this routine just go away just go away okay so we'll be back here tomorrow I for you again everyone try to have a nice day and then tomorrow we can talk about nice things and we'll do the mailbag tomorrow so that'll be fun at least I'm venture taro this is the Ben Shapiro show
