1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,020
If you’ve ever tried to sing the star spangled
banner,

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,100
“You see”
You know it’s not easy.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,660
“And the rockets’ red glare.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,980
Can’t go that high.”

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,210
The lowest note and the highest note are an

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,790
octave and a half apart.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,350
That’s 12 full notes.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,760
For comparison, God Save The Queen spans seven
notes.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,050
Oh Canada?

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,350
It’s nine.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,710
Yes exactly Estelle, this is why we need a
new national anthem.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,710
What?

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,200
No.

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,300
Joss, This is why the national anthem is so
great.

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,700
Nonono theFfrench anthem is great.

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,790
And it’s got a range of nine notes.

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,260
Nine notes is enough to make Yvonne cry
in Casablanca.

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,240
“Viva La France!!”

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,100
But 12 notes?

20
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,140
That just feels like failure.

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,900
I know the words to it but I’m so aware
of how bad I sound that I have to stop right now.

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,500
Ok so it’s not just the overall range,
The whole song feels like it’s trying to

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,640
lose us, starting with the first line.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,730
So you go "Oh say can you see."

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,600
I've already traversed an octave from "say"
to "see"

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,540
That’s music theory expert Paula Telesco.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,360
But from "see" I have to go up to "by the."

28
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,420
So now I've traversed a 10th, and we're only
in the second measure.

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,290
And then right here, you’re also hit with
a chromatic note, which means it’s not in

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,630
the same key that the rest of the notes are
in.

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,220
And that comes right after this dive.

32
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,130
An “Interval” is the distance between
two notes.

33
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,770
If they’re right next to each other, they’re
called “steps.”

34
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:53,810
Most music moves by step, meaning a smaller
percentage of skips.

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,100
But the star spangled banner is full of skips,
including fourths,

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,720
fifths,
sixths,

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,120
a tenth!

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,920
So you know it's kind of treacherous.

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,990
That’s why music teachers in the 30s opposed
the law that officially made the star spangled

40
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,258
banner our national anthem.

41
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:16,140
And a writer in the 1920s said that “No one with
a normal esophagus can sing it without screaming.”

42
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,250
And in 1906 the Washington Post called it
“perhaps the most ...unlovely tune that

43
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,740
was ever wrung from the quivering bowels of
a horn.”

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,280
Are you done?

45
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,290
Yes.

46
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,510
I’m just saying..

47
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,590
Shouldn’t the national anthem be something
we can all sing?

48
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,590
Exactly.

49
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,400
Ok but how often do you really need to do
that?

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,360
I mean consider the context where most Americans
even hear the song.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,860
The super bowl, NBA finals, the World Series.

52
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,900
Why shouldn’t the national anthem performance
be just as challenging and anxiety ridden

53
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,080
as whatever sporting event it’s commencing?

54
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,800
What happens when you start too high?

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
You’re screwed.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
You’re totally screwed.

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,910
That’s Matt Farnsworth.

58
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,910
He’s a vocal coach and teacher in New York
City.

59
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,520
People think I should just start in a comfortable
range, like “oh say.”

60
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,800
That would be my comfortable range.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,640
But really I need to start down here.

62
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,780
“Oh say” Otherwise, I’m going to be
very very high by the time I get to the end

63
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,280
of the song.

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,200
“Land of the free”

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,260
And the vowels in these lyrics make it even

66
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,260
harder.

67
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,910
“O’er the land” — open vowel.

68
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,129
“Of the” and then all of a sudden you
have to go to a closed vowel, which is i:

69
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,560
— i: and u: are closed vowels.

70
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
“Free.”

71
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,080
So you got to figure out how to sing the e
vowel with an open throat, but close it on

72
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,580
top.

73
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,420
Talented singers pull this off by mixing their
chest and head voice.

74
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,700
So chest voice is like your Ethel Merman.

75
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,800
“Give my regards to Broadway.”

76
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,120
Head voice is when we think of like opera
singers.

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,030
If you’re just using your chest voice at
“the land of the free” It’ll sound like

78
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,030
this.

79
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,500
“Land of the” and then you feel the “free”
and it just feels like it’s not going to

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
go.

81
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,050
But if you incorporate your head voice just
a little,

82
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:11,060
it’s like hitting a game winning fadeaway
jump shot.

83
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,640
And notice how Jennifer Hudson went up even
more on “Free”

84
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,089
That’s not just an octave and half, that
two octaves.

85
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:24,900
There’s one person who did it so well that
a recording of the song peaked at 20 on Billboard

86
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,640
Hot 100.

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,740
“Land of the free.

88
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:38,100
And the home of the brave.”

89
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,240
If our anthem was easy to sing, Joss, we would
not get these moments.

90
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,680
Ok I’m not saying I don’t have goosebumps,
but let the record show that that microphone

91
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,689
was not on.

92
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,080
Wait wait wait wait wait.

93
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,760
That was pre-recorded?

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,620
You’re killing my heart right now.

95
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,639
Are you positive?

96
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,680
But let’s talk about the lyrics, which were
written by a slaveholder and, in the 3rd stanza

97
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,259
they celebrate the death of slaves who sided
with the British in the war of 1812.

98
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,520
But the song is about Fort McHenry in Baltimore,
which withstood a 24 hour attack from the

99
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
British navy.

100
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,600
So the big inspiring idea here is that the
country …. still exists.

101
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,060
Is it the ramparts yet?

102
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,820
I keep going to the ramparts.

103
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,400
Oh.

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,160
Whose bright stripes.

105
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,580
Perilous...night?

106
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,300
Um.

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,320
Brave.

108
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,139
These words are more descriptive than motivating.

109
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,710
They’re also phrased really awkwardly,
so it’s no wonder that they just don’t

110
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,980
stick in our brains.

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,860
“Whose bright stripes and bright stars … and
the heavenly light.”

112
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:52,199
[checks hand] “Were so gallantly”
“You know I had a really good laugh about

113
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,069
it and you know you get over things and you
know you get back up again.”

114
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,300
Christina you deserve better.

115
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,660
No no no.

116
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
Hold up.

117
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,960
America loves watching people publicly fail.

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,560
“And the rocket’s red glare.”

119
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,280
“Written by Francis Scott off-Key.”

120
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,120
We should be grateful that the Star Spangled
Banner gives us those moments.

121
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,340
“Banner yet wave”

122
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Yeah I don’t know quite what it was I was

123
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,840
watching, but I think that’s another example
of I think she really tried to do something

124
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,469
new with it and it just wasn’t as successful
as she hoped it would be.

125
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,580
Yes, it’s risky to for performers to try
something new.

126
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,560
But when they do it well, it’s amazing.

127
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,900
Let’s rewind back to 1968.

128
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,039
It’s game 5 of the World Series and José
Feliciano, a 23-year-old blind Puerto Rican

129
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,050
folk singer is there to do the anthem.

130
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,180
“Oh say can you see”

131
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,969
Now it’s immediately apparent this doesn’t

132
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,770
sound like the star spangled banner.

133
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,050
It’s the height of the Vietnam War, and
our national anthem sounds like a peaceful

134
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,319
folk tune.

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:19,900
“And the home of the brave”
He finishes it and then listen closely.

136
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,400
There are boos.

137
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,800
One woman was so angry she said she was going
to write a letter to her senator to complain.

138
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,949
But RCA released the the live recording as
a single.

139
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:40,009
And it was the first time the national anthem
made it on the Billboard charts.

140
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,539
Fifteen years later Marvin Gaye walked up
to center court at the 1983 NBA Allstar game with

141
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,489
a shocking amount of swagger, and took a cue
from Feliciano.

142
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:59,580
“By the dawn’s early light”
By the end the crowd was clapping with him.

143
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:07,589
“O’er the land of the free”
We don’t need a different National Anthem

144
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:08,639
to feel something.

145
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,009
We just need the right singer.

146
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,120
Like maybe these singers?

147
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,400
“Of the coming of the lord”

148
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:26,940
“Oh beautiful for spacious skies”

149
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,820
“May we forever stand, true to our god and
true to our native land.”

150
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,440
Oh so you want one of those to be our national
anthem?

151
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,640
To be honest they’re a little religious
for my taste.

152
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,320
See!

153
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,280
People have tried, in vain, to replace the
star spangled banner for a really long time.

154
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,740
It’s not going anywhere anytime soon.

155
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,820
So just enjoy it when it’s good.

156
00:08:51,080 --> 00:00:00,000
And enjoy it when it's bad too.
