>>  WITH REPUBLICAN CLOUT
RAPIDLY FADING IN CALIFORNIA,
THE FAILURE TO HAVE ANY GENERAL
ELECTION CANDIDATES FOR THE
SENATE AP GOVERNOR'S RACES IS A
VERY REAL POSSIBILITY AND COULD
PROVE DISASTROUS FOR THE
G.O.P.'S FUTURE IN THE STATE AND
POTENTIALLY THE
G.O.P.-CONTROLLED CONGRESS IN
WASHINGTON.
CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY IS TUESDAY.
IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE TOP TWO
CANDIDATES ADVANCE REGARDLESS OF
PARTY.
THE JUNGLE PRIMARY IT'S CALLED.
REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE OF
THE POLLS THERE AND THOSE ARE
CURRENTLY THE STATE'S DEMOCRATIC
LT. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOME AND
REPUBLICAN BUSINESSMAN JOHN COX,
ONE AND TWO.
JOHN COX JOINING US FROM SAN
DIEGO AND PROESH IT.
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, LELAND,
THANK YOU.
LELAND: HOW MUCH OF THIS IS
ABOUT KEEPING REPUBLICANS
RELEVANT, MUCH LESS TRYING TO
WIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE FORGET
THAT IN CALIFORNIA, WE'VE HAD A
SUCCESSION OF REPUBLICAN
GOVERNORS.
YOU GO BACK TO RONALD REAGAN IN
THE '60S AND PETE WILSON AND
GEORGE, AND ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER, AND WE'VE
ELECTED A LOT OF REPUBLICAN
GOVERNORS HERE, YOU KNOW, JERRY
BROWN, AS A MATTER OF FACT, IS
THE ONLY DEMOCRAT.
GRAY DAVIS, YOU KNOW, WAS
ELECTED AS A DEMOCRAT AND THEN
WAS RECALLED, SO PEOPLE--
>> I UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY
HILLARY CLINTON WON THAT STATE.
>> SHE DID.
LELAND: YOU'RE FIGHTING AN
UPHILL BATTLE, FAIR TO SAY?
>> YES, EXCEPT WHAT THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IN THIS
STATE, THEY'VE OVERREACHED.
CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST TAX
BURDEN IN THE COUNTRY, THE
HIGHEST POVERTY RATE, OUR ROADS,
OUR SCHOOLS ARE A MESS.
WATER HAS BEEN UNAVAILABLE FOR
FARMERS AND FOR PEOPLE, OUR
EDUCATION SYSTEM SPENDS HUGE
AMOUNTS AND HAS POOR RESULTS.
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE
WANT A BUSINESSMAN IN THE
GOVERNOR'S MANSION JUST LIKE WE
HAVE A BUSINESSMAN IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
I THINK THAT'S THE DEFINING
ISSUE HERE.
NEWSOME IS AN ELITIST AND WAY
LEFT--
>> YOU'VE GOT THE PRESIDENT'S
ENDORSEMENT AND GAVIN NEWSOME
WANTS SINGLE PAYER HEALTH CARE
IN YOUR STATE.
THE PROBLEM IS FUNDAMENTAL.
IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE IN THAT
YOU ARE WHAT THE PEOPLE OF
CALIFORNIA WANT, WHY IS IT WHEN
I TALK TO REPUBLICAN DONORS,
INCLUDING BIG TOP REPUBLICAN
DONOR IN CALIFORNIA, HE SAYS HE
FEELS LIKE THIS IS SORT OF AN
EXERCISE IN FUTILITY AND IT'S
MORE ABOUT TRYING TO PRESERVE
REPUBLICAN LEGACY AND PRESERVING
SPOTS FOR REPUBLICANS AND
REPUBLICANS TURNOUTS FARTHER
DOWN BALLOT?
>> THIS IS THE MEDIA INFLUENCE
HERE.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY
TO IT, LELAND.
IT'S FAKE NEWS, THEY THINK THAT
DEMOCRATS ARE INVINCIBLE.
I'M HERE TOLE IT YOU THAT THE
MIDDLE CLASS IN THE STATE IS
ALMOST NONEXISTENT.
WORKING PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD A
HOUSE.
THE GAS TAX IS THE BIGGEST
THING, LELAND.
THIS GAS TAX HAS RESULTED IN
PEOPLE BEING PUSHED INTO THE
POVERTY RANKS.
GAS IT NOW OVER $4 A GALLON.
AND PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, HAVE HAD
TO MOVE FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY
FROM THEIR JOB BECAUSE OF THE
COST OF HOUSING AND THEN GET HIT
WITH THIS GAS TAX, INSTEAD OF
REFORMING CAL TRANS, WHICH IS
FULL OF WASTE AND CORRUPTION.
I REALLY BELIEVE, LELAND, THE
VOTERS OF THE STATE.
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE MODERATE
DEMOCRATS OR INDEPENDENTS, THEY
WANT CHANGE.
THEY ARE SICK OF THE CORRUPTION
IN SACRAMENTO.
THEY REALLY WANT TO HAVE AN
AFFORDABLE LIFE.
THEY DOESN'T WANT TO WORK TWO
JOBS.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, UNEMPLOYMENT'S
PRETTY LOW HERE, BUT PEOPLE ARE
WORKING TWO AND SOMETIMES THREE
JOBS IN ORDER TO MAKE A LIVING.
LELAND: THAT BRINGS UP AN
IMPORTANT POINT.
WE SAW THE JOB NUMBERS COME OUT
YESTERDAY AND WE SAW PRESIDENT
TRUMP TOUT THEM.
THESE ARE RECORD LOW
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS.
>> YES.
LELAND: AS YOU POINT OUT, SO
MANY PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO
GET BY.
HOW DO REPUBLICANS ANSWER THAT
AND PUT THAT TOGETHER?
>> LOWER THE COST OF LIVING.
I BUILT APARTMENTS FOR A LIVING
AND BUILT THEM FOR $80,000 A
UNIT IN INDIANA.
IT'S 500,000, AND 700,000 HERE,
AND WHY?
GOVERNMENT.
IT'S NOT THE COST OF LAND.
IT'S GOVERNMENT REGULATION, IT'S
LITIGATION, IT'S APPROVALS AND
DELAYS.
THAT'S WHAT ENDS UP IN THE PRICE
OF A HOUSE.
AND THAT'S THE LARGEST SINGLE
COST TO ANY FAMILY AND IT'S
DRIVING PEOPLE INTO POVERTY.
THEY CAN'T SAVE MONEY OR PROVIDE
FOR THEIR FAMILIES.
THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE.
LELAND: WELL, MR. COX, MUCH LIKE
A BUSINESSMAN, UP AGAINST A HARD
LINE OR A
