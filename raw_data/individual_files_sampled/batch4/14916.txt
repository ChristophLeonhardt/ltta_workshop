you watching Poland daily business and Jack back me of London II Sarah yes sir welcome to the show thank you so much well you came to Poland not that often so the things are new for you what struck you well it was different than expectations well I came here specifically focusing on the young people of Poland in the UK the youth are extremely well they're not conservative put it that way they're quite left-wing only two percent are connected with the National Church whereas here fundamentally different we know that the polls show over 60% of young people are voting conservatively and the people I've met here are very tied to the national identity and their religion I think that's beautiful that's because we are so backwards that's certainly what the British press say that's why I'm here to dispel that and are we backwards no in fact you know I I'm quite considering moving here it's it's not it feels not like this is a place of normality of conservative values and family and faith and tradition and the UK is quickly becoming insane but we are lacking political correctness for example which is why Poland's so great okay but the way the political correctness is ranked well it's making a lot of people very on edge in England people are being imprisoned for things they say on Twitter which makes people quite concerned about what they can and can't say to the point where even some people who are very very PC are getting in trouble with the police as well a famous comedian in the UK who's been very very Pro PC was just cautioned by the police the other day for transphobia comments online it's it's quickly becoming a place where you feel like you have to whisper okay the freedom of speech one of the basic liberties of the liver society is being endangered in the West absolutely and when you try and talk about very real issues in the UK that the presence of extremist Islam mass immigration if you try and talk about these things many people simply get thrown behind bars so is there any explanation why is the British society or British authorities reacting like that a couple of things it's successive governments that have been moving increasingly increasingly to the left which is what I worry about could happen in Poland I worry about a Conservative government moving left on some issues because that's what happened in the UK yeah it's it's quite a terrifying state of affairs the left is also in very good relationships with Islam mm-hmm which is strange because Islam is conservative family I will not touch the issues of homosexuals in Islam and so on yet the left is happy with it and cooperating I actually I wrote a book about exactly that the cooperation between the left and Islam in England and it's so prevalent specifically in the labor party and what's interesting with labor which is extremely far left socialists they have a huge presence of Islamists within the party and they have quite a great deal of control within that party and now it's being exposed that the Labour Party is increasingly anti-semitic and the reason why is there are fewer Jews and more Muslims in the UK so the Labour Party in the the Socialists and the far left are pandering to the Muslim vote because that's what gives them power in elections but the British Islam or Muslims are productive part of the society they contribute everyone is that true I know a majority of British Muslim women in particular are unemployed and a significant significantly higher proportion of Muslim men in the UK are unemployed too many good Muslims but a large percentage not and there's some quite radical mosques in the UK funded by Saudi which are not so great I there is this famous preacher Islamic preacher that's citizen Chowdhury right history city released from the prison he'll be coming up this month I started a petition actually Anjem free jail and I'm calm I'm doing I'm actually doing a petition and taking it to the government about this they're freeing him this month which is quite terrifying he was connected to multiple terror attacks in the UK but he's just pretty well exactly he he's using his freedom of speech they say he's not doing it himself but he's inspired multiple terror attacks his own disciples went out onto the street and beheaded one of our soldiers in and was dead lost and almost ten years ago but if still since then lead London Bridge attack he one of his disciples were committed that attack as well though the terror in Britain is a very real thing yes Jack buck behalf London and United Kingdom conservative journalist was our guest sir thank you very much thank you very much for coming here thank you much for sharing the stories and we will be in touch with this sooner or later that was it for tonight's poll on daily business
