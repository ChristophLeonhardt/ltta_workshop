At 4 a.m., the first fishing boats
have already begun to unload their
fresh catch on the docks of Busan's 
cooperative fish market,
ready to be auctioned and
delivered to the fishing stalls
of the Jagalchi fish market
on the edge of Nampo Port, Busan.
At 5 a.m., hundreds of fishermen and 
professional fish buyers line across the nearly
1.8 million square feet of the cooperative 
fish market auction,
one of the largest 
in South Korea and East Asia,
host to more than 30 percent
of the country's fish production.
After the auction, the fish are loaded and
delivered throughout the city and country.
As well as the nearby Jagalchi market,
where they join the stalls and fish tanks
waiting to be chosen by eager seafood lovers.
