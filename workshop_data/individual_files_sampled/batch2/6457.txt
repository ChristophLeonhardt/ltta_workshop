so you know the Donald Trump in in Vladimir Putin recently met and they discussed whether the Russians colluded in the elections that part is comical and they decided that they were we were not going to pursue that any further and they decided to put that aside and then they thought about working together but first trumpet tweeted we negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives now it's time to move forward and working constructively with Russia so I just want to lay that out there so you know there's no talk of further sanctions against Russia if they colluded in this election Trump is now saying I'm done with it Rex Tillerson said the same thing I brought it up to him once he says he didn't do it and we're moving forward and now we're not gonna punish Russia we're gonna embrace Russia well Lindsey Graham's our Republican senator from South Carolina and accordingly hoping to post Graham's slam the president quote forgiving and forgetting Russian tampering in last year's election and said the move only increased suspicions of the Trump administration so it took a Republican to say that on this show last week I was saying they went and had this meeting and nothing came of it why is it media giving him all this credit for oh he brought the collusion issue up and the meddling issue up with Putin he brought up and then what happened so finally when Republicans go hey you know what that doesn't mean a damn thing that means that Putin at worst was you know abraded for it which according to our side and their side it wasn't even up ratings I got yeah okay did you guys meddle oh you didn't okay let's move on right but there's no consequences at all so thank you Lizzy Graham at least for making that clear point not every day that I thank Lizzy Graham on the show so now we move on to what he means by working constructively with Russians Trump says Putin and I discussed forming an impenetrable cybersecurity unit so that election hacking and many other negative things will be guarded and safe questions were asked about why the CIA and FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their server and were rejected wait wait wait wait wait what did you just say we would set up a cybersecurity unit with the Russians to investigate hacking in our elections are you mental we are gonna set up a cybersecurity unit we're a foreign country that by the way also doesn't necessarily have our best interests in mind at all times I wouldn't do this with our closest ally let alone Russia would then have access to some of our voting information because they're helping us with cybersecurity no no Trump didn't deal with the Russians this is my speculation but he didn't deal with them who's insane enough to suggest that you know why because Putin told them in the meeting hey why don't we do better next time we do cybersecurity together I have access to all the information believe me you get reelected there's no other logical explanation for an idea this is sane I'm not the only one saying that again I'm gonna turn the Republicans here here's Lindsey Graham on this idea he wants to work with Blatt amir putin claiming that this cybersecurity unit will prevent future election hacking and many other negative things will be guarded what say you sir it's not the dumbest idea I've ever heard but it's pretty close he gave a really good speech in Poland President Trump did and ahead of what I think is a disastrous meeting with President Putin two hours and 15 minutes of meetings Tillerson and Trump are ready to forgive and forget when it comes to cyber attacks on the American election of 2016 not the dumbest idea I've ever heard but pretty close damn then John McCain another Republican senator says and this is a summary of it McCain had dead pans on Trump's cybersecurity unit with Russia Putin could be of assistance quote since he's doing the hacking oh that's insane and and look I you know that I have no respect for Donald Trump's intelligence I'm at the one end of the spectrum on what I think is intelligence I mean if he's there's some chance he's in the single digits anyway in IQ but even so this is not an idea where somebody would say hey guys you want to do a cybersecurity like it's like if the wolf comes up you can go so you want to guard the henhouse together the only reason you would contemplate that no matter how stupid you are is if you want to make sure that that hen house is rated you don't go to the wolf and go oh oh yeah you want to protect the hens with me nobody's that stupid okay now one more thing Steve minuchin is of course is Treasury secretary and until they withdrew this well which we're gonna get to in a second manoosh is still going and he says and this is likely and other strategic alliance whether we're doing military exercises with our allies or anything else this is about having capabilities to make sure that we both fight cyber together which i think is a very significant accomplishment for president Trump so minuchin goes out there and defends this insane idea just like this is a great idea we're going to work on cyber together okay so then what is Trump do hey minuchin meet the underside of a bus we just changed that a couple hours later so he now tweets the fact that President Putin and I discussed a cyber security unit doesn't mean I think that can happen it can't but a ceasefire can and did what in other words I'm just saying I did Sadie yeah I was just saying you know I was saying maybe we do cyber security know everybody hates it everybody thinks it's an insane idea no no it can't happen I didn't say could I'm just saying but now I realize it can but a ceasefire day remember that's what we talked about it I did the ceasefire that freezes the conflict in Syria where Bashar al Assad Putin's ally has a huge lead so you see how tough I was on Putin no I'm not sure that I do if you want to get a sense of how bad this idea was not just be cannon gram who've been tough on it Trump in some contexts in other situations now let's go to Fox News this is one of their most conservative so-called analysts and listen to what he says about this idea the absolutely harebrained notion that we would get my team up with Russia to form a cybersecurity unit to protect our elections it's like teaming up with the Mafia to fight crime like this I think I mean one thing yeah yeah - he walked it back yesterday because any of the Republicans on the Capitol Hill were so outraged by such a crazy idea look that's Carl Ralph Peters I mean I don't know there's seven guys in the country more conservative than him so even he's going wow that is really brazen did idea what the Russia and that meeting was not the old Putin accountable it was to talk about how they could do further deals and cover up the last one how much more obvious can he make it for you support independent media come join us at the Young Turks TYT Network calm slash
