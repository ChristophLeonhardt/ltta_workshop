1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,980
IN THE WAKE OF
YESTERDAY'S ELECTION.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,770
AND ONCE AGAIN IT IS
HAPPENING IN MAINE.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,780
LAST NIGHT VOTERS IN MAINE
VOTED ON A BALLOT MEASURE TO

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:23,870
EXPAND MEDICAID TO LOW INCOME
PEOPLE LIVING WITH THAT STATE.

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:36,550
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO DO
THESE SORT OF THINGS

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,560
BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY COMES
IN, BUT THEY PASSED IT.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:01:04,750
AND THE GOVERNOR WILL NOT LET IT
HAPPEN IF HE HAS ANY SAY.

8
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,650
THAT IS A HUGE FINANCIAL
INCENTIVE TO INSTITUTE THE

9
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,680
SORT OF PROGRAM IN YOUR STATE.

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,150
IF YOU ARE IDEOLOGICALLY
OPPOSED, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH

11
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,280
APPARENTLY.

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,380
PAULA PAGE NOT ONLY VETOED, HE
WILL ALSO ATTEMPT TO STOP

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:25,119
THE BALLOT INITIATIVE.

14
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:40,180
>>SO RAIDING THE RAINY DAY FUND
ñ IF IT'S NOT TO GIVE

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:02:00,090
HEALTH CARE TO SICK DYING
PEOPLE WHAT IS IT FOR?

16
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,440
>> MAYBE FOR A
TRI-CENTENNIAL PARTY.

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:15,041
IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF IT WAS
JUST THIS, SO THEY'LL MAKE

18
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,010
SURE HE DOESN'T.

19
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,010
BUT THIS IS COMING OFF
OF JUST YESTERDAY ñ

20
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,849
MAINE LAST YEAR AND THE ELECTION
THEY HAD VOTED TO INSTITUTE

21
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,120
RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN
STATEWIDE ELECTIONS THERE.

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,390
HE IS ALSO DELAYING THAT UNTIL
2021 IF AT ALL.

23
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,440
RIGHT NOW THERE IS A PETITION
DRIVE GOING ON IF THEY CAN

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,060
RAISE SIGNATURES THAN THEY CAN
HAVE A STATEWIDE VOTE ON A

25
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,060
PEOPLE'S VETO OF THAT BILL.

26
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:56,050
>> I THINK THERE ARE
TWO KEY LESSONS.

27
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,010
YOUR GOVERNMENT IS NOT
WORKING FOR YOU.

28
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,890
YOUR GOVERNMENT IS JUST NOT
WORKING FOR YOU, A SECOND OF ALL

29
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,720
JIMMY SAID POLITICAL FOOTBALL
WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING.

30
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,340
IN THE CASE OF HEALTHCARE, THAT
IS THE CASE BIG TIME, IT IS

31
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,340
A POLITICAL FOOTBALL.

32
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,830
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

33
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,680
MEANWHILE IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE
LOWER ON OUR GDP THAN WHAT

34
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,280
WE ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING.

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:30,700
THAT IS LIKE SAYING WE
ARE SPENDING 300

36
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,510
BUCKS FOR YOUR CAR A MONTH.

37
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,569
I AM NOT A MATHEMATICIAN.

38
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,390
>> IT DOES MAKE SENSE IF YOU
WERE THE GUY SELLING THE

39
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,540
MORE EXPENSIVE SHITTIER CAR.

40
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,370
>>IT

41
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:55,200
IS KIND OF STUNNING THAT THEY
ARE ABLE TO DO THIS PUBLICLY.

42
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,459
>> HE DIDN'T WAIT, IT WAS
IMMEDIATELY.

43
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,830
>>AND BY THE WAY I DON'T HAVE AN
ALTERNATIVE PLAN TO GIVE

44
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,930
HIM THAT.

45
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:16,019
IT'S LIKE THERE IS NO
SHAME ANYMORE.

46
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,639
STUFF LIKE THIS, WE JUST
DENY PEOPLE HEALTHCARE.

47
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,139
IT IS JUST THIS DISCONNECT.

48
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,319
>>THIS IS THE DUDE WHO WAS
MAKING THOSE RACIST

49
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,020
COMMENTS ABOUT OUT-OF-STATE
DRUG DEALERS.

50
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:42,080
HE APPARENTLY ñ NEXT YEAR IS HIS
LAST YEAR, HE IS TERM LIMITED.

51
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,199
TO SOME EXTENT THAT MAY BE
BREATHING WORSE BEHAVIOR

52
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,279
BECAUSE HE FIGURES I AM
LEAVING NEXT YEAR ANYWAY.

53
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:57,550
>> I HEARD THAT WHEN YOU CALL
HIS OFFICE AN INTERN PICKS

54
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,849
UP AND TELLS YOU GO
FUCK YOURSELF.

55
00:04:59,849 --> 00:00:00,000
>>I CAN IMAGINE THAT.
