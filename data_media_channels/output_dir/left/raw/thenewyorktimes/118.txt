1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,890
Supporters of
Nicaragua’s ruling party

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,500
rally behind their
president. The man

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,580
who once helped
overthrow a dictator,

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,060
but is now accused of
becoming a dictator himself.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,740
Daniel Ortega first came to
power nearly 40 years ago.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,160
He returned for a second shot
at the presidency in 2007

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,740
and quickly set out
to consolidate power.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,350
He even got rid
of term limits.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,740
We watched this
live broadcast

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,240
of Ortega’s speech
in the town

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,330
of Masaya, the heart of
a popular uprising that

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,830
threatens to
bring him down.

13
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,070
As he called
for peace and unity,

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,200
his police forces
opened fire on residents

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,945
just blocks away from me.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,550
The people pushed back.

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,470
Residents began
erecting barricades

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,690
three months ago in
response to the state’s

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,640
violent crackdown
on protesters.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,060
The barricades snarled
traffic and infuriated

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,350
the government.

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,110
Masaya quickly
turned into a war zone.

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,710
Guardabarranco — that’s
his nom de guerre —

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,520
used to run 
a snack food business.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,410
In April, he stopped
working to help

26
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,720
defend his neighborhood.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,290
It’s the one bastion
of resistance

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,375
that police had
failed to control.

29
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,650
The people of Masaya
fought police forces

30
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,370
for months.

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,430
But their barricades
would soon fall.

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,830
In the capital, Managua,

33
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,570
the opposition
movement continues,

34
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,460
fueled by the injustice and
terror of the crackdown.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
It all started back in April.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,110
People came out to protest
cuts to Social Security

37
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,043
and were confronted with
tear gas and bullets.

38
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,630
President Ortega later
scrapped the reforms,

39
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,760
but it was too late.

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,250
It was no longer just
about Social Security.

41
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,370
This was about democracy.

42
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,290
Ortega had stacked
the courts, taken

43
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,650
over the legislature
and rigged elections.

44
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,460
And the people 
had had enough.

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,730
They started to demand
that Ortega resign.

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
About 300 have been killed
in violent clashes

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,110
since protests began, including
several police officers

48
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,690
and many students.

49
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,430
In a defiant move,
about 200 students

50
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,590
occupied this
public university.

51
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,080
They were holed up here for
months, surviving on donated

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,690
food and medical supplies.

53
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,630
Jonathan López is a third-year
economics student.

54
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,610
The mood was quiet, but tense.

55
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,022
Everyone knew 
what was coming.

56
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,930
Police and paramilitaries

57
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,763
attacked the very next day.

58
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,074
Two students were killed
and several others injured.

59
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:13,070
The rest were trapped
through the night.

60
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,690
Eventually church
leaders negotiated

61
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,990
to end the standoff,

62
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,660
and the students 
were released.

63
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,230
We went back to Masaya

64
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,333
as President Ortega
stepped up attacks

65
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,913
on this rebel stronghold.

66
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,030
That morning,
Salvadora Medina’s son,

67
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,700
José Esteban, had been shot
in the chest by sniper fire.

68
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,590
She said she’d been
cooking him breakfast

69
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,990
when the shot rang out.

70
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,320
Police and paramilitaries
finally pushed through

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,930
two days later and raised
the flag of the ruling

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,030
Sandinista party in the
neighborhood plaza.

73
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,290
Ortega has called it
Operación Limpieza:

74
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,940
the cleanup operation.

75
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,760
It’s a nationwide strategy
to stamp out the unrest,

76
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,210
clear barricades and root
out resistance at any cost.

77
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,400
What will happen next?
No one knows.

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,110
But for the moment,
Ortega appears

79
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,430
to be winning the
battle over his critics,

80
00:06:03,430 --> 00:00:00,000
if only by sheer firepower.
