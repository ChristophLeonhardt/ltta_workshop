>> ARTHEL: CONNER POWELL, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE UPDATE.
>> ERIC: AT THE UNITED NATIONS
THERE'S A BITTER DIVIDE OVER THE
VIOLENT PROTESTS THAT RESULTED
IN MORE THAN 100 PALESTINIAN
DEATHS AT THE BORDER WITH
ISRAEL.
THE U.S. SEE TOTE
THE U.S. VEE TOTE
THE U.S. VET TOTE
THE U.S. VETOEOTE
THE U.S. VETOEDTE
THE U.S. VETOED A SECURITY
COUNCIL CALLING IT ONE SIDED.
THE U.S. FAILS TO WIN BACKING
FOR THE MOTION CONDEMNING HAMAS.
NIKKI HALEY AT WEDNESDAY'S
SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING CALLED
OUT THOSE NATIONS VOTING AGAINST
THE RESOLUTION.
>> IT IS OUTRAY JUST
>> IT IS OUTRAGEJUST
>> IT IS OUTRAGEOUST
>> IT IS OUTRAGEOUS FOR THE
SECURITY COUNCIL TO FAIL TO
DEFEND ROCKET ATTACKS AGAINST
ISRAELI CIVILIANS WHILE THE
HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL APPROVES
SENDING A TEAM TO DEFEND ACTIONS
TAKEN IN SELF-DEFENSE.
I URGE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY
COUNCIL TO EXERCISE AT LEAST AS
MUCH SCRUTINY OF THE ACTIONS OF
THE HAMAS TERRORIST GROUP AS IT
DOES TO ISRAEL'S LEGITIMATE
RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE.
>> ERIC: WE'RE JOINED BY
AMBASSADOR DANNY DANON, FORMER
ISRAELI DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER.
WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU.
>> ERIC: YOU ARE CALLING FOR
HAMAS TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
WHY?
>> HAMAS IS A TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION.
IT'S RECOGNIZED BY THE U.S., BY
THE E.U., BY MANY OTHER NATIONS
BUT NOT BY THE U.N.
IT'S THE SAME WAY YOU RECOGNIZE
AL-QAIDA AND ISIS, YOU SHOULD
APPLY SANCTIONS ON HAMAS
LEADERS, ON THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS.
I THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL
FOR THE STABILITY IN OUR REGION.
ALL THE PICTURES WE ARE SEEING,
ALL THE CASUALTIES, IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF HAMAS.
THEY ARE SENDING INNOCENT PEOPLE
TO THE FENCE.
THEY'RE VERY CYNICAL.
WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST
FEW DAYS WHEN THEY SENT ROCKETS
AND MISSILES INTO ISRAEL.
>> ERIC: WHAT'S THE REACTION OF
YOUR FELLOW DIPLOMATS.
THERE'S AN ISIS, AL-QAIDA
COMMITTEE AT THE U.N. THAT IS IN
PROGRESS AND IT OPERATES AND
SANCTIONS INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS
BUT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING DEALING
WITH HAMAS.
>> IT WILL NOT BE EASY.
I'M AWARE OF THAT.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED ON FRIDAY.
THEY CAST A RESOLUTION FROM
KUWAIT AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO
MENTION THE WORD HAMAS.
I SAID WHY, CAN'T YOU SPELL
HAMAS?
CAN'T
WHN'T
WHY'T
WHY CAN'T YOU PUT IN THE
RESOLUTION THE WORD HAMAS.
I THINK IT WILL TAKE MORE TO
CONVINCE OTHER COUNTRIES.
THE U.S. IS STANDING WITH US.
WE WANT TO THANK NIKKI HALEY.
SHE SAID WE SHOULD NAME HAMAS.
>> ERIC: WHY THIS AN EFFORT
AMONG YOUR COLLEAGUES TO
BASICALLY PROTECT HAMAS?
>> I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
I ASKED MY COLLEAGUES FROM
FRANCE, FROM SWEDEN, WHO ARE
INFLUENTIAL, WHY YOU COULDN'T
INSIST ON PUTTING HAMAS IN THE
RESOLUTION.
THEY COULDN'T ANSWER THIS
QUESTION.
I THINK IT'S COMING FROM THE
ARAB COUNTRIES, THEY WANT TO
CONDEMN ISRAEL.
THEY MENTIONED ISRAEL FIVE TIMES
IN THE RESOLUTION BUT THEY
CANNOT NAME HAMAS.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING IT UP
TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL.
IF HE
IF YE
IF YOU WANT TO HELP THE
PALESTINIANS IN GAZA, YOU MUST
CONDEMN HAMAS.
>> ERIC: THE PALESTINIAN
OBSERVER AT THE U.N. IS PUSHING
BACK AGAINST ISRAEL ON THIS.
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.
>> WE DEEPLY REGRET THE
COUNCIL'S CONTINUED PARALYSIS ON
OUR ISSUE DUE TO THE RECURRENT
NEGATIVE AND BIASED POSITION OF
ONE PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE
SECURITY COUNCIL.
WE DEPLORE THE USE OF THE VETO
TO CONTINUE SHIELDING ISRAEL
FROM CENSOR AND ACCOUNTABILITY
FOR ITS CRIMES AGAINST OUR
PEOPLE.
>> ERIC: THEY ARE CRITICIZING
THE U.S.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE CRITICS
WHO SAY ISRAEL HAS HAD A DISPRO
PORTION NET RESPONSE --
DISPROPORTIONATE RESPONSE TO THE
VIOLENCE.
WE SAW A MEDIC THAT WAS KILLED,
OTHER PEOPLE KILLED DURING THE
RIOTS AND THEY'RE BLAMING THE
JEWISH STATE FOR THIS.
>> SHAME ON THEM.
SHAME ON MR. MONSOO FOR THIS.
WE DEFEND OUR BORDER.
I THINK HAMAS PAYING PEOPLE,
SENDING THEM TO THE FENCE, USING
THEM AS HUMAN SHIELDS, THEY
SHOULD BE CONDEMNED.
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY
CASUALTIES.
WHEN YOU HAVE 40,000 PEOPLE,
RIOTERS COMING TO THE FENCE,
THEY WILL NOT STOP AT THE FENCE.
THEY WILL CONTINUE INTO
COMMUNITIES.
THEY WILL SET THEM ON FIRE.
WE ARE PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO THAT.
OUR MESSAGE TO HAMAS IS CLEAR,
IF THE CHILDREN IN ISRAEL ARE
NOT ABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, THEY
WILL FEEL THE MIGHT OF THE
I.D.F.
>> ERIC: YOU REJECT THE
CRITICISM THAT ISRAEL
OVERREACTED.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IF YOU LOOK AT ANY OTHER
DEMOCRACY, IF YOU HAD 40,000
PEOPLE COMING TO THE BORDER OF
THE U.S. IN THE MORNING, IMAGINE
THE OUTCOME.
SAME WOULD BE FOR FRANCE,
SWEDEN.
WE ARE DOING THE BEST TO
MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF
CASUALTIES.
HAMAS WANTS TO SEE MORE AND MORE
CASUALTIES.
>> ERIC: THEY'VE BEEN FLYING
KITES AND BALLOONS OVER THE
FENCE WITH THE GASOLINE TO BURN
UP THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF THE
FIELDS.
LET ME READ YOU A QUOTE FROM THE
JEWISH VOICE.
THE KITES, GO TO THE BEACH AND
FLY A KITE AT THE BEACH.
THIS IS KITE TERRORISM.
THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND
MINISTRY OF FINANCE WILL PROVIDE
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR FARMERS IN
THE GAZA BELT WHO HAVE SUFFERED
MATERIAL DAMAGE FROM FLAMMABLE
KITES AND HELIUM BALLOONS THAT
HAVE BEEN SENT OVER WITH THE AIM
OF SETTING FIELDS ON FIRE.
THERE ARE NEW MEASURES TO COMBAT
KITES INCLUDING SPECIALIZED
DRONES TO NEUTRALIZE THEM.
THEY'VE SHELLED OUT $300,000
WORTH OF DAMAGE.
DID YOU EVER EXPECT TO SEE KITES
FLYING OVER THE BORDER, DROPPING
GASOLINE BOMBS?
>> THE HISTORY OF HAMAS, THEY
FOCUS ON DESTRUCTION AND HATE.
WE THINK HOW TO BUILD, HOW TO
SUPPORT PALESTINIANS.
THEY PUT A LOT OF ENERGY AND
THEY'RE VERY CREATIVE, FINDING
WAYS TO BURN FIELDS IN ISRAEL,
FINDING WAYS TO DIG TUNNELS.
WHY DON'T THEY PUT THAT ENERGY
INTO THE PALESTINIANS IN GAZA
WHO ARE SUFFERING EVERY DAY.
IT'S CYNICAL.
IT'S PITIFUL.
I HOPE ONE DAY PALESTINIANS WILL
BE STRONG ENOUGH TO SAY ENOUGH
FOR THE HAMAS REGIME.
>> ERIC: THEY VOTED THEM IN.
THEY USE A LOT OF CONCRETE NOT
FOR THE ROADS BUT TO BUILD
TUNNELS.
IT IS CONTINUING.
