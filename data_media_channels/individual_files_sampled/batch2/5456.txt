how are you gonna celebrate Father's Day work I'm gonna work I'm gonna actually be calling North Korea I'm gonna be calling I just have a call from your friend from fan France emannuel so the problem is the president didn't seem to do either of those he spent part of Father's Day as well as several hours on Saturday at the trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls Virginia and the White House has not released a readout of any call with North Korea meanwhile former White House strategist Steve Bannon is standing by his old boss claiming that President Trump has never lied or mislead the American people you famously kept the white board of presidential promises to keep track of what he was keeping that's a promise that he obviously broke he has not always told the truth I don't know that I mean what I see is yes I mean there's another thing to do the president's never lied not to my knowledge on all the time I don't believe that come on I think he speaks in a particular fernack Euler that connects the people in this country okay so as long as I'm on this set that's the last time we're gonna hear from him okay I wanted to get out of the soundbite early because I don't need more line I don't need Kellyanne or Steve Benton to come and tell us more lies that's not helpful we're here to tell the truth ever hear to hear propaganda running interviews with Steve Bannon you're just giving a platform for political propaganda it's just as bad as probably you said earlier we could do we could this immigration problem with the separation on the border is solvable and is imminently solvable but it starts with dominant moral leadership you have to have a president who goes to the Congress and says you fix this because I'm gonna use a bully pulpit every single day to create the outrage of fixes but as we showed earlier in the show he just reverses his policies on whims you know on Syria and on the Russian investigation why are you fired call me just goes on and and on you can't trick this the Republicans can't trust anything that he's going to say or do now or in the future which is why they can't hold on to a ground but if he was a dominant moral leader he would say do this or I will win because the the bully pulpit is very very powerful he's been clear Mika don't you think about what his strategy is the president has actually been quite clear in this instance he is using children as political pawns to try to get his wall White House said he's not going to get his wall so the children are going to continue to suffer going to continue to be separated from their parents are going to continue to be kept in metal cages I'm sorry people had problems with the terminology cage I think that the wires and wire what should we call it being I'll kennel that is going to continue as long as this White House is using children as political golf but also using lies and muddling of the truth and undermining the Free Press and all the things that have been happening every step of the way here to make people really feel confused about what reality is and therefore leaving them with less power less authority over themselves and less understanding as to what direction our country is headed in so those people cannot be given a platform we want to have the truth and we want to understand what is happening we want to stick to the facts and we have to worry about what David Ignatius said at the top of the show the dangers of a country losing its empathy Reed Madeleine Albright's book it's called aptly fascism a warning and we are clearly way past the warning phase and that's not hyperbole that's not rhetoric this is deep concern about the direction of our country and we'll say it calmly about that way the the Stooges on Fox News and there's some really good people there but there are a few who are absolute megasuck megaphones for this president and they will take any little overreach any little shrill comment and use that as a way to promulgate the president's extremely cruel lies and policies and we can't let that happen it's happening in the media as much as it is in this presidency and the comm shop they are Fox News is to come shop for the whitening up next how much does the president really envy the control that Kim Jong hoon has over his people well to the smiles of Fox News hosts he let us know that's next on Morning Joe thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
