Lindsey Graham who has turned into something kind of awesome like Lindsey Graham 2.0 is so much better than Lindsey Graham 1.0 it's not it's not even close like the new software update is just fantastic so Lindsey Graham the senator from South Carolina ripped into Diane Feinstein for for ripping into Cavanaugh on his supposing anger on fox news here's Lindsey Graham I like Dan Feinstein I don't think she leaked dr. Poor's name to the media but somebody around her may have if you saw this man as yelling I saw a man who was offended to his core defended his good name took it to the people who are trying to destroy his family what would you do if you're in that situation do not let these people do what they've done to judge Cavanaugh and reward them by saying he's no longer fit because he is in the world's worst position of defending himself against a bunch of garbage from people who don't care about fairness okay and that's exactly right senator Graham was even better when he did a some sort of public event with the Atlantic he said that how Cavanaugh has been treated is despicable and the audience started pulling him he went directly after the audience which was just spectacular I don't like what the president said last night I'm the first person to say I want to hear from dr. Ford I thought she was handled respectfully I thought Cavanaugh was treated like crap yeah well boo yourself good for him boom Lindsey Graham just droppin the hammer gotta love that sort of stuff and again the the hypocrisy of many members have left on it's not all members of the left many members the left on this is just astonishing people who are saying oh it's just a job interview really does it sound like just a job interview I know when I interview somebody for a job the first thing I do is throw uncorroborated allegations of sexual assault at them that's the first thing that I do when we interviewed send you she came in here and I was like Sonia so I heard that you raped a chicken and then we just started from there and then if she got mad I was like sorry we can't have you here I'm sorry that's it that we would try to run people through the gauntlet around here in our job interview
