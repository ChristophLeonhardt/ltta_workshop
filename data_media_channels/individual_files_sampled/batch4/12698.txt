the media has become obsessed with reporting rumors about the tensions within the Trump administration as opposed to being obsessed with reporting the news telling the truth or not being slimy knuckleheads damaging the country with their hysterical opposition to Republicans no siree so here's a pound up of recent reporting about the inner workings of the administration as the reports came direct from our nose for news journalist NBC has reported that anonymous sources told someone familiar with the situation who called the friend of a friend who then told the girl in the NBC mail room whom he was sleeping with when it was supposed he was supposed to be it was supposed to be his weekend with the kids that Donald Trump is angry at Attorney General Jeff sessions sessions recused himself from the investigation into whether there was collusion between the cartoon Russian spies from the old rocky and bullwinkle shows and people Trump fired so long ago but one can remember who they are the rumored reports of reported rumors that there are tensions between Trump and sessions come hard on the heels of reported rumors that there are rumored reports of tensions between Trump and Steve Bannon Bannen of course is chief strategist in charge of destroying all that's good and true in the universe in order to establish the supremacy of the white race over his office which has been moved next to the West Wing men's room according to the Washington Post where democracy dies in darkness but turning on the light spikes the electricity bill so to hell with it Trump fell out with Bannen over bannon's falling-out with sessions over his falling-out with Trump The Post received word of the feud from an anonymous friend of an anonymous source actually named anonymous who said that Trump and Bannon were seen in an argument in the Oval Office during which Trump hit bannon's fists so hard that bannon's arms swung around in a big circle causing Bannon to punch himself on top of the head Bannon responded by trying to poke the president in the eyes with two fingers but the president put his hand on his forehead blocking the strike and then laughed at Bannon saying quote knock knock knock whereupon Bannon surprised the president by twisting his nose in 180 degree circle The Post reported the feud with Bannon over the nbc's reported the feud with sessions may have been the result of a report on Axios that Bannon had arranged the firing of chief of staff Reince Priebus according to anonymous sources familiar with the situation of other anonymous Priebus only continues to show up for work at the white house because he's embarrassed to tell his wife that he's been fired 16 times the reported Priebus firings are part of a reported administration shake-up that could affect every corner of journalists imaginations the reported drama and feuding in the White House will continue until reporters in Washington DC find something useful to do with their lives

terrible just nightmarish sounding shooting in Washington the Congress was preparing for its charity baseball game and the Republicans were preparing and a guy named James Hodgkinson his alleged GG is the alleged shooter he's now dead he's 66 he's from Illinois he is a guy you know when they go on his social media he's a guy who spouts a lot of left-wing rhetoric kind of very what we just going to cliched left-wing rhetoric and he took us he opened up with a rifle and shot Steve Scalise who is the Majority Whip the Republican whip and fortunately because gliese is apparently fine well let's hear Donald Trump talking about it he made a statement today Melania and I are grateful for the heroism and praying for the swift recovery of all victims congressman Scalise is a friend and a very good friend he's a patriot and he's a fighter he will recover from this assault and Steve I want you to know that you have the prayers not only of the entire city behind you but of an entire nation and frankly the entire world America is praying for you and America is praying for all of the victims of this terrible shooting so Scalise that the lucky thing was that because Scalise is in leadership because he's the whip he has a contingent of cops to protect him and of course the cops and another guy with a gun apparently this is I haven't quite got this information yet I took the shooter down and they were wounded as well and that's those are the heroes the president is talking about Rand Paul described this thing being in a shooting situation where you are unarmed because of course Washington DC has such a stringent anti gun laws that you it's very very hard even to get a carry permit for your home and they've had real problems with the Supreme Court saying you know this is they've gone too far so nobody was armed so Rand Paul describes congressman Rand Paul describes what a nightmare it is to be in this situation without firearms our lives were saved by the Capitol Police had they not been there I think it'd have been a massacre and you are completely helpless and you know having no self-defense and no way to get to somebody the the field was basically a killing field I mean if you were to run out there while the shooter was still shooting he would have shot anybody he was shooting people as far away as right-field so I mean he I think that that's probably but 75 yards or so and that's about where we were I was lucky to be that far away but he's still shooting people 75 yards away and there's no stopping and it appeared as if after a while that he might have been advancing and had the Capitol Hill police not been there he could have walked around the field and just shot everybody your only chance would have been to run and so at some point we decided escape was really the only option and we did have a route of escape the people in the dugout had no route though because they're in a dugout that goes down a foot or two their only chance of survival is to get down below the surface of the ground and they were to come and pop up there were only 20 yards from the shooter and so they really had no choice had the Capitol Hill police not been there to prevent the advance of the gunman I just you know as terrible as it is it could have been a lot worse really I mean it just sounds absolutely horrific Jeff Flake congressman Jeff Flake apparently after the shooter was taken down rushed out of the dugout - to get to the wounded Scalise and stop the bleeding or at least put some pressure on the bleeding users belt for a tourniquet it was it seems a politically motivated crime now that doesn't mean that the guy is some great political philosopher it means he's probably most of these guys are deeply mentally ill most shooters a deeply mentally ill but he his mental illness was keyed off his politics congressman ron the scientists seem to have had a meeting a confrontation and encounter with the guy before the shooting took place so here's DeSantis describing that i actually left a little early probably about a couple minutes before this all happened and as I was getting into the car with one of my colleagues Jeff Duncan there was a guy that walked up to us that was asking whether there was Republicans or Democrats out there and was just a little odd and then he kind of walked towards the area where all this happened so we've told the police that was he carrying anything he was not carrying anything at the time but from where the shots were I would think that that would have probably been staged because there was no one that was obviously walking around with a rifle at the time but it was just a little odd that he kind of really you know walked up to us to ask and then went ahead and I probably was probably like 3 minutes 5 minutes after we pulled out of the parking lot what time did you leave congressman because according to bret baier the shooting started this morning at 7:15 the gunman with a rifle we left it up probably no later than 7:10 so he just got out of there before the thing open I mean the whole thing just sounds like a nightmare now you I know what you wondering yesterday I was talking about the Julius Caesar in Central Park where Julius Caesar is dressed up as Donald Trump and every night courtesy of the funding from the New York Times and courtesy of funding from Time Warner the owners of CNN every night the audience stands up and cheers to the sight of Donald Trump being knifed to death and you're wondering if I'm going to blame this shooting on them on and am I going to blame it on Kathy Griffin for holding up the severed head of Donald Trump and all the people who have been talking about Donald Trump at the level of rhetoric that they've been talking about and I'm not and there's one very specific reason that I'm not going to do that and the reason is I don't work for CNN and I don't work for the New York Times and I don't work for the ABC and I don't work for the left-wing media that does this all the time that I mean we only have to go back I mean you could go back to John F Kennedy in the whole fact that that they covered up they spent 20 years 30 years 40 years covering up the fact that Kennedy was a cold warrior killed by a communist but let's not go back that far let's just go back to 2011 when Gabby Giffords a congresswoman was shot and a terrible incident in Arizona I want to start just reminding you because it's not enough for me to talk about I want to play some of this stuff from that time but first I want to start by playing a friend the shooters name was Jared Laughlin there and he was like like all these guys at crackpot and I hesitate to call him a schizophrenic though that's technically what happened the only reason I hasn't stated that is most schizophrenics it's a tormenting terrible disease most kids romantics are incredibly are peaceful and never cause harm so I don't want to demonize them but it's some kind of people do this stuff almost always because they are mentally ill almost always it's it's because they're mentally ill especially in America where we're really not dealing thank God with the kinds of things that need to be stopped with a gun but let's just play here is Jared loft nurse buddy who was talking about his motivation this is cut to not watch TV he disliked the news he didn't listen to political radio he didn't take sides he wasn't on the left he wasn't on the right okay and here is a montage from recent TV of the incredible incredible barrage of rhetoric against Sarah Palin and other right wing commentators and other people who made comments that could be construed as violent Sarah Palin had put a rifle sight over among other gap others Gabby Giffords you know area the her area that she was the congresswoman over saying we've got to target these areas and take them over and this was blamed the sheriff in Arizona blamed Sarah Palin blamed other Republican candidates and the news just ran with it here is a montage a selection party has treated this tragedy in a reprehensible way they claimed their rhetoric has nothing to do with the shooting a lot of his political philosophy was anti-government he had picked up some of the extreme right position it sprinkled with things anti-government seeing the government as an enemy what's been the role of talk radio and fueling the heated language wouldn't you be smiling too if you had the entire Democrat Party running interference for you I tried to inflame the public on a daily basis 24 hours a day seven days a week that does impact people who may have a mental problem pale in fact Sharron Angle an arrest got their first target Glenn Beck himself has been responsible for three wanted assassination attempts this year at glenn beck who obsesses nearly as strangely as this mr. Loffler did about gold and debts of books you mentioned there's a theme that runs through all of them and book the idea of the individual against the state they refused to stop calling it a jobs killing health care repeal the right wing loves the go to rhetoric for them is wouldn't it be fun to kill the people we just yeah so that was the the left reacting to the shooting the non-political shooting by a madman of Gabby Giffords and we are not going to do that because we're not them but but that in itself creates a problem I just want to end this part before we say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I just want to end by talking about Ross do thoughts column this morning which I bet he wishes he had back talking about Julius Caesar in the park and do that is one of the house conservatives at the New York Times and he wrote a column called the Trump eeeh Stroman of them all and it begins the problem with staging a Julius Caesar in which Caesar clearly resembles Donald Trump the culture war controversy du jour thanks to Shakespeare in the Park isn't the doing so encourages the president's assassination so that's we know that right there know the problem with the Trump a fight Caesar is that the conceit fails to illuminate our moment the way a good classical illusion should that's the problem with putting that in the park just so you know so we're gonna continue talking about this because it really is it really does create a very specific moral dilemma for us but first like I say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but that means horrors you're going to miss the mailbag but if you come over to the Dino no it's like your life is gonna continue just the way it is look in the mirror is that what you want no deathly wire.com come on over you can hear the rest of the show if you subscribe you can watch the show on the site and be in next week's mailman
