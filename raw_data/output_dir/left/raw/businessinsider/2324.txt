Andrew thanks for being with us given a

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,760
etc what are your current views on crude

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,369
oil for the market for 2010 well first

off thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you heather for being here and</font>

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,550
see it's my pleasure take a look in the

2010<font color="#CCCCCC"> our commodity price</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forecast for</font>

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,890
oil is 475 dollars a barrel oil has

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,469
remained much firmer than the natural

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">economy kind of regained some footing</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know oil price war remain firm</font>

that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit under Iran's</font>

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,239
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that there are folks</font>

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,800
out there who think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the political</font>

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,739
risk component could always come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,719
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing a much larger fashion but</font>

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,520
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we tend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little more</font>

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditional and think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well you know</font>

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,640
let's think on supply and<font color="#E5E5E5"> demand and</font>

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,229
ultimately i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what comes down to</font>

25
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,090
global growth what were the growth rates

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,610
in the fourth quarter and last year on

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,760
the oil<font color="#CCCCCC"> side you know we're starting to</font>

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,770
get numbers right now with earnings

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,000
coming out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the companies that</font>

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">i cover we're reporting really in two</font>

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,100
weeks overall the initial data points

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,720
have been excuse me on the smaller

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">mid-cap side that we've had a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,830
of production declines really reflecting

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,290
a year of reduced capital spending and

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,390
lower rig counts sir producers hedging

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,670
going into 2010-11<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the gas bowls yes producer is</font>

39
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,280
generally heads for to project cash

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,369
flows<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as we look in 2010 with a</font>

41
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,409
higher oil and gas futures curve the

42
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,450
additional hedging that my companies

43
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,369
have added in had largely been to

44
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,740
protect 2010 activity which again

45
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,360
following on 2009 where activity was

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">very low</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now that provides an</font>

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,229
opportunity to develop more production

48
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,240
growth those capex budgets are they

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,469
growing and is that going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue</font>

50
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">throughout the year yes capex so far has</font>

51
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,750
been up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think around ten to fifteen</font>

52
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,990
percent across my<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies and I think</font>

53
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">really coming out of winter in my mind</font>

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,810
skizz that if gas prices and seventy

55
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,970
percent of my companies or my companies

56
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,260
produce on average seventy percent

57
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,680
natural gas if gas prices soften from

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,540
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 556 our level out there</font>

59
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,580
currently at then we could see softening

60
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,860
and capex otherwise i would expect it

61
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,240
because of the hedging because of the

62
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,920
forward curve that will see kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,840
current spending plans kind of sustained

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,120
through the year so even oil opponents

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,260
are saying we're going to have to start

66
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">drilling in the US what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean</font>

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">for domestic oil companies well I mean</font>

68
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's certainly a lot of oil potential</font>

69
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,570
in the US the question is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

70
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,310
frame will it take to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oil to</font>

71
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,570
market I mean that's it's certainly a

72
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,940
very complex question you know from my

73
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,040
standpoint you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've seen</font>

74
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,780
discoveries in parts of the Gulf of

75
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,310
Mexico<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a peep a lot of interest</font>

76
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,709
here in the last month that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Plus that</font>

77
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,600
you know the addition of shale gas over

78
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,130
the last couple of years you know

79
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,690
provides an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting opportunity for</font>

80
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,520
us to increase our indigenous oil and

81
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,410
gas supplies so there was a new

82
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,330
accounting standard that I believe was

83
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,519
applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your company's is this last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

84
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,500
quarter or this last year what what is

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and how does it how does it affect</font>

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,470
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies or how you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

87
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,300
sure it really has to do with how oil

88
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,340
and gas<font color="#CCCCCC"> reserves are priced historically</font>

89
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,530
the old rule was that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would use the</font>

90
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,790
price in effect on December 31st and

91
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,260
companies were concerned you know in

92
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,760
prior years that if you had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

93
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,680
volatility that the December 31st price

94
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,080
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not reflect real kind of sustainable</font>

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,330
kind of activity and so the SEC moved

96
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,030
last year to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a essentially average</font>

97
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,500
price for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year and so this will be</font>

98
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,360
the first year that we see those prices

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
roll through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserve reports given</font>

100
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,670
recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquisitions in the space Exxon</font>

101
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,370
XTO do you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> continuing or is it</font>

102
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,170
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of joint ventures or is it outright</font>

103
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,019
sales I mean in the oil and gas space

104
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,900
there's always a healthy amount of

105
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,880
properties divestitures and acquisitions

106
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,680
and across what with most of my

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies being kind of under five</font>

108
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,190
billion<font color="#E5E5E5"> a market cap that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they tend to</font>

109
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,410
be more active at than the larger

110
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,560
players if you look at 1998 in 2004 Big

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,048
Ma waves you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that those kicked off</font>

112
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,459
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the summertime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and night</font>

of the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the small and mid-cap</font>

116
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,599
guys kind of consolidating now if thats

117
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">suggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heading into the</font>

118
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,289
spring you know if commodity prices

119
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,759
soften again that we could see

120
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,160
additional M&A activity great<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

121

Andrew thank you
