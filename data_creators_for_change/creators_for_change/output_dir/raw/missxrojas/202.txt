<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago</font>

38
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,600
so it was one for all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subtle they're</font>

39
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,380
like adults

40
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,640

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,010
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> late evening in green and the</font>

00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,979
campus are absolutely beautiful but it's

43
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,020
funny to see

44
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,700
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an outside view and you</font>

45
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outsider and be so</font>

46
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,840
conscious of not wanting to impose and

47
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">then very precious time</font>

48
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,049
somos I Tiffany's I should be easy

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,340

everywhere which is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> move anyone</font>

52
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,880
and the US

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,070
afraid of you getting that you're gonna

54
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,510
say something

55
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,250
I know it's to admire it just

56
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,229
it's strange<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

57
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,030
it's racially but then I suppose if I

58
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,099
were hyper aware of the British<font color="#CCCCCC"> baguette</font>

59
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,629
bread<font color="#E5E5E5"> put me next to a lot more in</font>
