00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:21,279
Ex-Nazi, Oskar GrÃ¶ning, is convicted for
his involvement in the murder of 300,000 people.

3
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:31,579
The 94-year-old former Auschwitz bookkeeper
was sentenced to four years in prison.

4
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:45,320
In 2011, a German court set a legal precedent
that ex-Nazis could be prosecuted for war

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:53,039
crimes.
Now, former SS men can be held accountable

6
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:03,339
for mass murders without specific evidence.
German war crime prosecutors are investigating

7
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:08,410
30 other cases as a final push for justice.
But the advancing age of ex-Nazis has raised

8
00:01:08,410 --> 00:00:00,000
debate over the necessity of prosecution.
