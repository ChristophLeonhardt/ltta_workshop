SEASON AND FLORIDA DELIVERS THE BIG SHOCKER.

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,751
BIG SHOCKER. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT BOTH

10
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,052
IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT BOTH PARTIES PICKED CANDIDATES THAT

11
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,555
PARTIES PICKED CANDIDATES THAT THE OTHER PARTY SAYS IS

12
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:21,955
THE OTHER PARTY SAYS IS UNELECTABLE?

13
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,890
UNELECTABLE? >> YEAH, BOTH SIDES ARE HIGH

14
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:25,325
>> YEAH, BOTH SIDES ARE HIGH FIVING AND THEY THINK THE OTHER

15
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,827
FIVING AND THEY THINK THE OTHER GUY WILL BE EASY MEAT.

16
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,562
GUY WILL BE EASY MEAT. I SUGGEST THAT WE’RE REALLY IN

17
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:29,729
I SUGGEST THAT WE’RE REALLY IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY HERE.

18
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:32,532
UNCHARTED TERRITORY HERE. NOT ONLY DID DONALD TRUMP UPEND

19
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,534
NOT ONLY DID DONALD TRUMP UPEND CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BUT FLORIDA

20
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,070
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BUT FLORIDA VOTERS DID IT AGAIN BY PICKING

21
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:37,837
VOTERS DID IT AGAIN BY PICKING ANDREW GILLUM.

22
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,172
ANDREW GILLUM. YOU HAVE THE DEEPEST BLUE

23
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:40,573
YOU HAVE THE DEEPEST BLUE PROGRESSIVE AGAINST THE REDDEST

24
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,775
PROGRESSIVE AGAINST THE REDDEST TRUMP CONSERVATIVE.

25
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:42,809
TRUMP CONSERVATIVE. FORECASTING WHAT’S GOING TO

26
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:44,578
FORECASTING WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS RACE IS REALLY

27
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:44,945
HAPPEN IN THIS RACE IS REALLY DIFFICULT.

28
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,780
DIFFICULT. DEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO,

29
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,749
DEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO, REPUBLICANS EITHER ELATED

30
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,284
REPUBLICANS EITHER ELATED BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT GILLUM

31
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,686
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT GILLUM IS JUST GOING TO FALL AND BE

32
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:53,186
IS JUST GOING TO FALL AND BE EASY MEAT.

33
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:55,488
EASY MEAT. AND THE DEMOCRATS THINK THAT

34
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,257
AND THE DEMOCRATS THINK THAT DeSANTIS IS KIND OF A BIT OF A

35
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:58,892
DeSANTIS IS KIND OF A BIT OF A PAPER TIGER, THAT HE DOESN’T

36
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,861
PAPER TIGER, THAT HE DOESN’T HAVE MUCH SUBSTANCE BEHIND HIM.

37
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,262
HAVE MUCH SUBSTANCE BEHIND HIM. REALLY IF YOU SCRATCH THE

38
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,297
REALLY IF YOU SCRATCH THE SURFACE, THERE’S A TREMENDOUS

39
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,198
SURFACE, THERE’S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM

40
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,799
AMOUNT OF REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM THAT WE SAW IN THE PRIMARY

41
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:06,166
THAT WE SAW IN THE PRIMARY YESTERDAY.

42
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,501
YESTERDAY. THEY HAD KIND OF RECORD TURNOUT.

43
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:09,036
THEY HAD KIND OF RECORD TURNOUT. SO DID THE DEMOCRATS.

44
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,804
SO DID THE DEMOCRATS. SO KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

45
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,272
SO KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO’S GOING TO GET AN EDGE IN

46
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,274
WHO’S GOING TO GET AN EDGE IN THIS VERY INTENSE AND

47
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,509
THIS VERY INTENSE AND HYPEREMOTIONAL ATMOSPHERE IS

48
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,876
HYPEREMOTIONAL ATMOSPHERE IS DIFFICULT.

49
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,178
DIFFICULT. >> DID GILLUM WIN OR DID THE

50
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,613
>> DID GILLUM WIN OR DID THE FIELD JUST KILL GRAHAM?

51
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,215
FIELD JUST KILL GRAHAM? >> IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF

52
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,650
>> IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING, BUT IN THE END

53
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:26,287
EVERYTHING, BUT IN THE END ESPECIALLY DOWN HERE IN MIAMI,

54
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:28,822
ESPECIALLY DOWN HERE IN MIAMI, MIAMI-DADE, BROWARD, DUVAL

55
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:30,590
MIAMI-DADE, BROWARD, DUVAL COUNTY, THESE LARGE URBAN

56
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,326
COUNTY, THESE LARGE URBAN COUNTIES DELIVERED REALLY BIG

57
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,660
COUNTIES DELIVERED REALLY BIG MARGINS.

58
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:33,794
MARGINS. IN MIAMI WHEN YOU TALKED TO

59
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:34,995
IN MIAMI WHEN YOU TALKED TO PEOPLE THAT ARE DEMOCRATS, A LOT

60
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:36,997
PEOPLE THAT ARE DEMOCRATS, A LOT OF THEM REALLY LOVED GILLUM.

61
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,499
OF THEM REALLY LOVED GILLUM. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS HOLDING

62
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,134
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS HOLDING THEM BACK WAS THEY WOULD SAY I

63
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:41,735
THEM BACK WAS THEY WOULD SAY I DON’T WANT TO WASTE MY VOTE.

64
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:43,737
DON’T WANT TO WASTE MY VOTE. LIKE THEY WANTED THEIR VOTE TO

65
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,038
LIKE THEY WANTED THEIR VOTE TO COUNT.

66
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:48,075
COUNT. >> THEY DIDN’T --

67
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,143
>> THEY DIDN’T -- >> THEY WEREN’T SURE THAT HE

68
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:50,845
>> THEY WEREN’T SURE THAT HE COULD WIN THE NOMINATION OR

69
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:51,612
COULD WIN THE NOMINATION OR WEREN’T SURE THAT HE COULD WIN

70
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:52,346
WEREN’T SURE THAT HE COULD WIN THE PRIMARY.

71
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,982
THE PRIMARY. I USUALLY TELL PEOPLE, LOOK,

72
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:56,851
I USUALLY TELL PEOPLE, LOOK, VOTE FOR THE PERSON YOU LIKE.

73
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:58,352
VOTE FOR THE PERSON YOU LIKE. THEN I’D PROBABLY VOTE FOR

74
00:01:58,354 --> 00:01:58,653
THEN I’D PROBABLY VOTE FOR GILLUM.

75
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:00,655
GILLUM. I THINK YOU SAW THAT CALCULUS

76
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:01,789
I THINK YOU SAW THAT CALCULUS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE.

77
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:04,224
HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. THIS REALLY CAME AS QUITE AS A

78
00:02:04,226 --> 00:02:05,459
THIS REALLY CAME AS QUITE AS A SHOCK TO ALL OF US.

79
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:07,261
SHOCK TO ALL OF US. THE POLLING DID NOT PICK UP THIS

80
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:08,796
THE POLLING DID NOT PICK UP THIS SORT OF MOVEMENT AND THESE SORT

81
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,464
SORT OF MOVEMENT AND THESE SORT OF MARGINS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO

82
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,366
OF MARGINS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GET IN THESE BIG URBAN COUNTIES.

83
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,101
GET IN THESE BIG URBAN COUNTIES. >> THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE OF A

84
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,070
>> THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE OF A SURGE BUT I’LL ADMIT I WAS

85
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:16,971
SURGE BUT I’LL ADMIT I WAS SKEPTICAL BECAUSE THERE HADN’T

86
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:18,806
SKEPTICAL BECAUSE THERE HADN’T BEEN A HISTORY OF

87
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,574
BEEN A HISTORY OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS SPIKING

88
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:23,144
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS SPIKING A TURNOUT IN A DEMOCRAT PRIMARY

89
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:23,778
A TURNOUT IN A DEMOCRAT PRIMARY IN FLORIDA IN THE PAST.

90
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,847
IN FLORIDA IN THE PAST. SO IT DID UPEND CONVENTIONAL

91
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:26,180
SO IT DID UPEND CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.

92
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:27,381
WISDOM. >> THERE HASN’T BEEN AN

93
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:28,383
>> THERE HASN’T BEEN AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CANDIDATE LIKE

94
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,250
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CANDIDATE LIKE ANDREW GILLUM.

95
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:29,951
ANDREW GILLUM. >> FAIR POINT.

96
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:30,485
