yeah started on social media but it
turned into a very real and dangerous
situation so-called paintball wars five
innocent people have been shot with
paintballs three of them children police
it is so-called paintball war began on
social media as someone's idea to help
stop the violence me and smoke and my
god dude it was really his idea he liked
that
we started paintball fight who was gonna
be fully I'm like me and another partner
he's like the Cooper names so damn like
 hey y'all sad we gonna pull
every shoot you shot me and my brother
unexpected we talked it it felt like it
was a real like a real shut up we're in
the back of a truck looking out the
window laughing yeah 20-30 minutes later
they pull up shoot me down on my house I
thought it was a game they come right
back
then it became a whole six mile the
first one it just it just started going
real real heavy man like real real real
real heavy
nobody nobody saved though you've been a
traded on each other that's - hey Mazz
up guns down
it's basically just doing something
positive to keep away from the negative
you know everywhere you go you would see
a gun nah when we started paint boiler
and where we went we seen a paintball
you know I was in a brother game with a
paint more than a bullet know this I
stay prepared just in case
try to slow you never know from trucks
like gloves this type of air right here
this nitrogen just to last you all
 day all goddamn day main
thing is we do this - have fun -
stop all the going around in
our city
you hear that break that
glass so you know what it is
honestly you probably spend about no
less than 1000 to 1500 at paintball and
that's if you want to have fun I'm just
telling him I told her what I spent when
I first got into it might well honey
after that it was like $50 day but we
all we needed to fill up airline 50 $60
day can't be broke with you in his port
we squashed a lot of beef that was going
on because it was a cup of dudes in it
really hug with each other so when I
saying them together I knew this
was real
it's definitely why people together
people that didn't know people didn't
know each other like I was losing the
club last night I'm bumping files of
people that I was in a paintball fire
that I never knew just cause us friendly
talking or Instagram following each
other I probably gained about 4 to 500
followers just off during the paintball
movement so I'm definitely brought a lot
of people together
god damn the Chief of Police
this bitch asked on my weed well
on a person ain't weapons in I'm calling
them replica firearms because when you
look at some of these paint guns they
look just like an actual firearm police
officers been confronted with someone
with a replica weapon or in this case of
paint gun they may make the mistake
thinking it's a real fire they feel
threatened there may be a deadly
response to that yeah we still go up
it's like every blue moon we got to
sneak up because of the police we've got
sometimes but at this point we had to
stop it because nobody want to go to
jail come out of the money just like
something that we just drawn on their
sunny point I mean to the police it's
gonna be like a real gun period no
matter what it is it could be a war to
go to the police doesn't look like a
real gun but they hate it hey I was
being young and black our brother for
the city to take the paint off the
buildings then picking up their bodies
any day we are ready to murder coupling
if we could paint ball with each other
and don't kill each other which we were
there
you
you
