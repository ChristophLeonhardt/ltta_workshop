1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,660
lots of happy anecdotes about online

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,390
advertising display in recent months

3
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,580
really in Patrick keen of associated

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,250
content what are you seeing well I mean

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,460
it's been a great summer in we're really

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,260
enthusiastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the fall so far i</font>

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,390
would say in<font color="#E5E5E5"> january it was pretty bleak</font>

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,520
it was pretty bleak for display it was

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,140
pretty bleak in terms of audience i

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,270
think for advertisers but we've seen a

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,469
pretty market increase in<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFPs in agency</font>

12
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,870
interest and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would just say over the</font>

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,640
past sort of three to four months so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,899
definitely encouraged by that of course

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,700
so what about looking at it next year

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,739
key ones always challenging this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now</font>

17
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are starting to</font>

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,370
talk about q1 what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see there q1 I</font>

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,870
mean we do have a fair degree of

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,690
visibility to q1 we're fortunate we're

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,010
seeing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of repeat business by</font>

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,590
advertisers and a lot of renewals so

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,449
we're actually pretty confident into the

24
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,250
first quarter second quarter we'll see

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,549
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know end of year this fall has</font>

26
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,840
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> as good as we've ever seen in our</font>

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,060
business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm encouraged by that I</font>

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,159
know you know in previous businesses i

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,020
was at CBS and others<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they were</font>

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">very trying times at the end of last</font>

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">year it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't just sort of the economic</font>

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,540
malaise but just sort of his display

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,180
working is this unique how do I couple

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,650
it with traditional media which is very

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,210
different from where I sit today but I'm

36
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">really seeing the market come around</font>

37
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,240
right now for sure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> is display</font>

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,560
working this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are struggling with you've seen</font>

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,590
huge success with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google lots of</font>

41
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,509
advertisers have now glommed onto that

42
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,430
said look it's so accountable whereas

43
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">display is just out there this whatever</font>

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,049
we have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what's going on so do</font>

45
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,700
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's changing I feel</font>

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,560
like there's been real revolution and

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
display or at least the start of it are

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,110
you seeing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well well yeah I mean</font>

49
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,299
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that there there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,220
of advertisers that are looking for sort

51
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,869
of the richness of opportunity rich

52
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,579
media the ability to own more screen

53
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,259
real estate all of those things but I'll

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,990
still say today that search and the

55
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,189
accountability of searches put

56
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,590
tremendous pressure on display click

57
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,420
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate is a metric that is useless</font>

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,890
to me engagement as a metric that's

59
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,050
useless to me as an advertiser are we

60
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,380
achieving your objectives

61
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,700
think that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

62
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,740
look at but search is putting so much

63
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,150
pressure on display today that click

64
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,830
through as a metric that that you use a

65
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,690
publisher if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to claim that</font>

66
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,980
you're not analyzing click through and

67
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,150
trying to give your advertiser and

68
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,610
experience to drive more audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

69
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,780
the creative that they're creating then

70
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,940
you're in the wrong game but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

71
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a need for a lot of</font>

72
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,320
innovation and display particularly on

73
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the creative side I still think that</font>

74
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a real hole and creative on the</font>

75
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,140
web<font color="#CCCCCC"> today and that needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be filled</font>

76
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,360
you know then this is coming from a guy

77
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,310
who sold 95 characters of text for four

78
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,260
and a half years which I would argue you

79
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,700
can be creative<font color="#CCCCCC"> in as well but I</font>

80
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,650
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I look at my inventory I</font>

81
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,110
like advertising the<font color="#E5E5E5"> combined search and</font>

82
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,180
display that brings the accountability

83
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,070
of search to display is something that

84
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,990
we're winning in today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we'll</font>

85
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,790
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win so talk more about that</font>

86
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,920
creative what is display if it continues

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work what does it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like in three</font>

88
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,980
to five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years what is the innovation</font>

89
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,020
what is good creative for this blood

90
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I mean I still think as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much as no</font>

91
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,800
one wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about click through</font>

92
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,210
and would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to move away from that I</font>

93
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need units that provide</font>

94
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,530
some level of interaction and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

95
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean just simply mousing over and</font>

96
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting an expandable unit or you know</font>

97
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,100
is it creating an e-commerce opportunity

98
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,050
right within a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> discipline</font>

99
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,330
inventory you know I also come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

100
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,310
school of advertising as an objective is

101
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,560
to sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> a product or service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so whether</font>

102
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,210
you're trying to move steel or you're in

103
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,860
an automotive OEM or you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

104
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,340
move packages and boxes of cereal you

105
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,350
still are measured against your ability

106
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,209
to sell so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think some level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

107
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,709
interactivity in units is going to be

108
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,570
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary I mean you can take</font>

109
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,310
over page you can have page interruption

110
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,290
you can have video inventory but if you

111
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,540
don't allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a user to interact with</font>

112
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that unit I think you're really missing</font>

113
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,720
because it still is the opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

114
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,970
measure those kinds of things today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

115
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,830
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why again i love search that</font>

116
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,600
drives into more display units so

117
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,060
totally different type of advertising

118
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,330
but do you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the huge dollars</font>

119
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,700
that are still spent on television on

120
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,459
magazines on newspapers<font color="#E5E5E5"> even after this</font>

121
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,380
crash are they going to migrate into

122
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,690
online display or are they going to

123
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,370
disappear or are they going to go into

124
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,260
search or online classified something

125
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,970
else well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would hope and this</font>

126
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,380
hasn't been the case as we know over the

127
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,479
years I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would hope that that advertisers</font>

128
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,130
follow audience

129
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,600
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the circulation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of most</font>

130
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,430
of the dead tree folks that is really

131
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,500
not kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the world is today so</font>

132
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,840
I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> really like to see advertisers</font>

133
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,610
follow audience there's still such a

134
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,830
tremendous disconnect with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

135
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,780
time that users are<font color="#CCCCCC"> spending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online and</font>

136
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,490
the dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> that agencies and</font>

137
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,960
advertisers are devoting to the medium

138
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that disconnect has to change it's</font>

139
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,040
been in my opinion incredibly slow

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,870
hasn't been<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search as we know search</font>

141
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,640
is now forty to fifty percent of all

142
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,140
online advertising that's not going to

143
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,730
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really do think that the</font>

144
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,260
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> of search is going to go up</font>

145
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,540
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need in my opinion display to</font>

146
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,340
look a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more like search to</font>

147
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,870
have that kind of measure ability and to

148
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,150
drive into experiences that are more

149
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,250
measurable for advertisers and I look at

150
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,410
our business we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to provide a</font>

151
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,530
truly measurable ROI driven and

152
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,090
accountable platform for brand

153
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,730
advertisers and that's our story we're

154
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,810
sticking to it and it's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

155
00:05:13,810 --> 00:00:00,000
well great good luck<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>
