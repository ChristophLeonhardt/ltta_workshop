Albert Einstein is famous for his
thought experiments that tested the
limits of human knowledge
one example is his twin experiment one
twin stays on earth while the other
speeds away in a spaceship
according to Einstein's special theory
of relativity the twin on the spaceship
will age slower how much slower depends
on the spaceships speed therein lies the
key to manipulating time imagine five
baby Einsteins are born on earth March
14 1879 one stays on earth the other
four get in spaceships to return to
Earth on March 14 1979 each spaceship
travels away and back at different
speeds
the first travels at 50% of the speed of
light second at 75% the third 99% on the
for that 99.999999 percent of the speed
of light now let's fast forward march 14
1979 on earth Earth Einstein is 100
years old
Einstein on ship one is 87 years old
Einstein on ship 2 is 66 years old
Einstein on ship 3 is 14 years old
and Einstein on shift 4 is one and a
half days old no spaceship around can
reach these speeds but it's still fun to
explore the possibilities with our own
thought experiments
it's what Einstein would have done
