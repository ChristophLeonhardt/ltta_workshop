1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,269
MARKINGS TO TRY TO TRACK THIS

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,372
BACK TO A PARTICULAR FACILITY.

3
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:08,274
AND THEN THEY'LL BE WORK

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:08,942
BACKWARDS FROM THAT.

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,544
I DID TALK TO A FRIEND, YOU

6
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,481
KNOW, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

7
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,050
DIAGNOSTICS GOING ON IN QUANTICO

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,317
NOW.

9
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,787
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THAT

10
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,255
WILL BE GOING AROUND THE CLOCK

11
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,255
DOWN IN QUANTICO.

12
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:26,793
THEY WILL BE TRYING TO LOOK AT

13
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,295
THESE TEN DEVICES THAT HAVE BEEN

14
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,297
COLLECTED SO FAR AND THE

15
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,234
PACKAGING THAT WENT WITH THEM IN

16
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,134
GREAT DETAIL.

17
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:36,969
YOU KNOW, REALLY IN A TEAM

18
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,671
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE DNA

19
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,373
SPECIALIST WILL BE TALKING TO

20
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,141
THE FINGERPRINT FOLKS, WILL BE

21
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:45,345
TALKING TO THE FIREARMS AND

22
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,046
MARKS FOLKS TO SEE WHO HAS THE

23
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,615
BEST OPPORTUNITY TO RECOVER

24
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,351
SOMETHING VALUABLE THAT MAY LEAD

25
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,154
THEM TO THE PERSON WHO BUILT

26
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,921
THESE DEVICES.

27
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:58,024
AND TO TAKE THE BEST SHOT WITH

28
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,026
THE PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE

29
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,162
THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO

30
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,463
RECOVER SOMETHING.

31
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,899
AND I THINK THAT WE CAN EXPECT

32
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,700
TO HEAR SOME MEANINGFUL RESULTS

33
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,902
OUT OF THOSE EXAMINATIONS.

34
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,671
PROBABLY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW

35
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:11,871
DAYS.

36
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:12,872
>> WELL LET'S HOPE.

37
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,074
>> THAT PROCESS IS NOT GOING TO

38
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:15,475
STOP.

39
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,442
>> LET'S HOPE.

40
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:17,677
RON, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

41
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,045
I JUST WANT TO READ SOME

42
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,980
INFORMATION THAT I'VE JUST

43
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,449
RECEIVED FROM THE NEW YORK

44
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:25,518
POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS TOLD OUR

45
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,321
AFFILIATE IN NEW YORK WCBS AND

46
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,491
ALSO TO BRING OUR VIEWERS UP TO

47
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:31,691
SPEED.

48
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,625
THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE

49
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,594
DEPARTMENT SAYS JUST BEFORE

50
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,362
8:00 P.M.

51
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,230
THE NYPD GOT A CALL

52
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,265
ABOUT A SUSPICIOUS ITEM PACKAGE

53
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,669
ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE TIME

54
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,936
WARNER CENTER.

55
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,439
ESU RESPONDED AND EVACUATED THE

56
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,473
THIRD AND SECOND FLOORS.

57
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:49,676
THE FIRST FLOOR IS CURRENTLY

58
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,376
BEING EVACUATED.

59
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,012
THE ENTIRE BUILDING IS NOT

60
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:53,312
EVACUATED.

61
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,580
SO THAT TELLS US SOMETHING ABOUT

62
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,582
THEIR LEVEL OF CONCERN.

63
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:57,450
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY CONCERNED

64
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,885
ABOUT THIS SITUATION, BUT NOT

65
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,020
CONCERNED ENOUGH TO EVACUATE THE

66
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,456
ENTIRE BUILDING AS THEY DID

67
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:03,856
YESTERDAY.

68
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:06,192
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S

69
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,127
IMPORTANT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

70
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,264
HERE LOOKING AT THESE DEVICES IF

71
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,634
ADDITIONAL ONES ARE DISCOVERED

72
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,803
NOT MISCALCULATE AND BY THAT I

73
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,704
MEAN, NOT SAY, LOOK, TEN OF THEM

74
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:22,609
HAVE BEEN RECOVERED SO FAR, THEY

75
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,644
DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY WERE READY

76
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,244
TO DETONATE.

77
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,613
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE

78
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,883
THE MECHANISM TO BE VICTIM

79
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,284
DETONATED OR VICTIM ACT WAITED.

80
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:33,285
LET'S LOWER OUR GUARD.

81
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,021
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S GOING

82
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,724
INTO THE CALCULUS THAT IS

83
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,694
ALLOWING THEM TO REMAIN

84
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,128
POPULATED.

85
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:42,628
THE BUILDING POPULATED.

86
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:44,264
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'VE DECIDED

87
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,664
NOT TO EVACUATE THE ENTIRE

88
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,533
BUILDING BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING

89
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,434
YOU JUST MENTIONED.

90
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,603
>> I THINK THAT.

91
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,473
AND IF IN A SCENARIO, LET'S SAY

92
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,042
IT'S A WORST CASE SCENARIO, THAT

93
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,578
THAT DEVICE IS PACKED WITH

94
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,746
EXPLOSIVE POWDER, THAT'S WHAT

95
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,312
WE'RE HEARING.

96
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,982
IT MAY BE POWDER.

97
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,017
IT MAY BE BLACK POWDER.

98
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:07,320
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY FOR SURE.

99
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,290
IT MAY BE INERT.

100
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,558
BUT LET'S SAY IT'S PACKED WITH

101
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:12,758
THAT.

102
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,827
A DEVICE OF THAT SIZE AND

103
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,262
DIMENSION, HOW MUCH DAMAGE COULD

104
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,630
IT POTENTIALLY DO?

105
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,098
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

106
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,267
WIPE OUT A MAIN COLUMN OR PILLAR

107
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:21,967
OF A BUILDING.

108
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,536
IT'S NOT GOING TO WIPE OUT AN

109
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,637
ENTIRE FLOOR OF THE BUILDING.

110
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:27,707
WE HAVE CONCRETE ABOVE AND

111
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,074
CONCRETE BELOW.

112
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,310
WE DON'T NEED TO EVACUATE THE

113
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:30,943
WHOLE STRUCTURE.

114
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,012
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS CLEAR OUT A

115
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,146
COUPLE FLOORS.

116
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:35,715
I THINK THOSE JUDGMENTS ARE

117
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,416
BEING MADE BASED ON WHAT THEY

118
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,551
KNOW SO FAR.

119
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,320
>> WE HAVE A TWEET FROM THE NEW

120
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,887
YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT.

121
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,157
AS A PRECAUTION THE NYPD IS

122
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,259
CURRENTLY EVALUATING A PAIR OF

123
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,560
UNATTENDED PACKAGES AT THE TIME

124
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,362
WARNER CENTER MALL.

125
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,496
MORE INFORMATION WILL BE

126
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,434
RELEASED AS SOON AS IT BECOMES

127
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:54,700
AVAILABLE.

128
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,636
NOW WE'RE HEARING A PAIR OF

129
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,403
UNATTENDED PACKAGES.

130
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,039
WE THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS A

131
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,008
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE ON THE THIRD

132
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:02,208
FLOOR.

133
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,576
NOW IT APPEARS THERE ARE TWOCHLT

134
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,378
NOW, THE FACT THAT -- TWO.

135
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,115
NOW, THE FACT THAT THESE ARE

136
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:09,982
UNATTENDED PACKAGES, RON, DOES

137
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,717
THAT TELL YOU THEY'RE DIFFERENT

138
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:13,152
THAN THE PACKAGES FOUND IN THE

139
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:13,453
MAIL?

140
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,288
>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY

141
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,555
GOT THERE.

142
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,257
WERE THEY PLACED THERE THROUGH

143
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,992
THE MAIL AND SOMEBODY INTERNALLY

144
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,560
DELIVERED THEM AND WEREN'T

145
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,362
PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING

146
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,364
ON IN THE NEWS AND THEY'RE

147
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,098
RELATED?

148
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,966
OR IS IT COMPLETELY, YOU KNOW,

149
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,636
OUT OF A SENSE OF SOMEBODY SEES

150
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:31,470
SOMETHING UNATTENDED IN THIS

151
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,938
TIME IN THIS LOCATION IN NEW

152
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:36,542
YORK CITY AND THEY CALL 911.

153
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,345
IT'S AN UNATTENDED PACKAGE.

154
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,413
SO WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN ANY SORT

155
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,281
OF DETAIL THE DESCRIPTION OF THE

156
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:42,548
PACKAGE.

157
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,584
THIS MAY BE AN ABUNDANCE OF

158
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,052
CAUTION BY SOMEBODY WHO SEES A

159
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,421
BACKPACK OR SOMETHING SITTING

160
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,222
UNATTENDED AND LIKE WE ARE

161
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:52,825
EXPECTED TO DO IN AN AIRPORT OR

162
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,527
RAILWAY TRANSIT, HEY, LET

163
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,362
SOMEBODY KNOW ABOUT THAT.

164
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,964
LET THE PROFESSIONALS COME AND

165
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,598
ADDRESS IT.

166
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,532
IF IT'S NOTHING, IT'S NOTHING.

167
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:03,202
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD A MINOR

168
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:03,636
INCONVENIENCE.

169
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,304
IF IT'S SOMETHING, WELL, THAT'S

170
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,239
IMPORTANT TOO.

171
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,440
SO IT COULD BE TOTALLY

172
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,342
UNRELATED.

173
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,143
IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WHEN

174
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:13,012
IT'S DELIVERED A COUPLE DAYS AGO

175
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,714
AND IT'S BEEN SITTING AND

176
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,215
NOBODY'S NOTICED UNTIL NOW.

177
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,017
>> MY PRODUCERS SAY THE

178
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,420
SUBBASEMENT AND WHOLE FOODS ARE

179
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,288
ALSO FULLY EVACUATED.

180
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,188
PAUL, ARE YOU STILL WITH US?

181
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,923
>> YES, I AM.

182
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,826
>> I'D LOVE TO ASK YOU AS WELL

183
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,661
WHAT YOU THINK IN A CITY LIKE

184
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,296
NEW YORK WHERE, YOU KNOW,

185
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,064
THERE'S A DELICATE BALANCE THAT

186
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,933
NEEDS TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN

187
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,067
PROTECTING THE CITIZENS AND THE

188
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,203
TOURIST SXSZ ALL THE PEOPLE ON

189
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,304
THE STREET -- TOURISTS, AND ALL

190
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,106
THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET WHICH

191
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,142
IS, OF COURSE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

192
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:43,409
PRIORITY.

193
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,710
BUT IT ALSO HAS TO CONSIDER THIS

194
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,046
IS A CITY THAT NEEDS TO KEEP

195
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:47,680
MOVING, RIGHT?

196
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,383
I MEAN THE TRAFFIC NEEDS TO KEEP

197
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:50,950
MOVING.

198
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,985
BUSINESS NEEDS TO COPE

199
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:53,252
HAPPENING.

200
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,187
YOU KNOW -- TO KEEP HAPPENING.

201
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,256
YOU KNOW, IT CAN'T BE

202
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,190
INDEFINITELY SHUT DOWN.

203
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,658
WHERE DO THEY STRIKE THAT

204
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:00,393
BALANCE?

205
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,426
>> THAT'S JUST IT.

206
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:04,163
RON PUT UP THE BEST ANALOGY YOU

207
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,798
COULD HAVE COMPARING IT TO AN

208
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,065
AIRPORT.

209
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,966
TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF ANALOGY,

210
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,335
WHEN WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN

211
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,469
FORT LAUDERDALE, YOU DIDN'T SHUT

212
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,805
DOWN THE AIRPORT, YOU SHUT DOWN

213
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,739
A TERMINAL.

214
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,041
THIS THIS PARTICULAR CASE -- IN

215
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,410
THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND IN THIS

216
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,412
CITY OF NEW YORK, WHAT'S UNIQUE

217
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,581
IS THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE

218
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,548
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE

219
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:29,522
DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE

220
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,423
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS.

221
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,458
AND THEY WORK IN CONJUNCTION

222
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,960
WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

223
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,293
CONSISTENTLY.

224
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,230
SO AS THAT RELATES TO TRAINING

225
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,798
THEY INTEGRATE THEIR TRAINING IN

226
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,901
SCENARIOS SUCH AS THIS IN

227
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,435
EVACUATION SCENARIOS.

228
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,403
THIS IS NOTHING NEW.

229
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,671
THEY REALIZE THAT.

230
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,273
THAT TIME WARNER CENTER NEEDS TO

231
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,141
STAY OPEN EXCEPT FOREVER THE

232
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,244
AREAS THAT -- FOR THE AREAS THAT

233
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,179
NEED TO BE RESTRICTED.

234
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,546
IT CAN BE ANY BUILDING.

235
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,982
SO THERE IS THAT BALANCE.

236
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,485
BALANCE IS BASED ON WHAT THE

237
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,120
PRONLT OF RISK IS -- PROBABILITY

238
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,656
OF RISK IS, WHAT THE IDENTITY OF

239
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,524
RISK IS, AND HOW BOTH GROUPS

240
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:07,894
HAVE TRAINED IN REGARD TO THE

241
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:16,335
THREAT AND HOW TO EVACUATE

242
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:16,668
EXPEDITIONLY.

243
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:17,069
-- EXPEDITIOUSLY.

244
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,571
A LOT OF TRAINING GOES INTO

245
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:18,771
THIS.

246
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,306
>> I'M SO GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO

247
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,442
MAKE THAT CALL AND I'M GLAD THE

248
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,610
EXPERTS ARE MAKING IT.

249
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,945
THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THEIR

250
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF

251
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,613
THE SITUATION.

252
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,515
I WILL POINT OUT THAT WE ARE

253
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,950
CONTINUING, THOUGH, TO SEE

254
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,286
GROUPS OF NYPD, YOU KNOW,

255
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,554
POURING INTO THE BUILDING WITH

256
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,021
LOTS AND LOTS OF EQUIPMENT.

257
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:36,254
>> SURE.

258
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:39,158
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL OF THIS

259
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:39,491
EQUIPMENT IS.

260
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:42,628
OF COURSE WE SAW THE BOK SQUAD

261
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:42,929
EARLIER.

262
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,796
MAYBE YOU -- BOMB SQUAD EARLIER.

263
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:46,766
MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN THIS TO

264
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,767
US.

265
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,435
>> THE NYPD IS 36,000 STRONG.

266
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,136
THE LARGEST POLICE DEPARTMENT IN

267
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,003
THE UNITED STATES.

268
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,971
AND VERY WELL FUNDED.

269
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:56,542
THEY DO HAVE EQUIPMENT THAT MOST

270
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,643
DEPARTMENTS CLEARLY DO NOT.

271
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,844
AND THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THAT

272
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,813
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS

273
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,447
SUPPRESSION EQUIPMENT.

274
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,948
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

275
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:05,318
IF THERE'S A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE

276
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,652
AT ANY PARTICULAR BUILDING,

277
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,688
WE'LL USE TIME WARNER, AND IT'S

278
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,791
IDENTIFIED AS A SUSPICIOUS

279
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,192
PACKAGE, THE DEPARTMENT'S

280
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,227
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CONTAIN

281
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:15,427
THAT.

282
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,330
WE'RE TALKING EXPLOSIVE DEVICES,

283
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,732
AS RON POINTED OUT BLACK POWDER.

284
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,901
THE DIFFERENCE HERE BEING THAT

285
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:26,506
IF THAT PACKAGE APPEARED TO HAVE

286
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,608
WHITE POWDER OR POTENTIALLY

287
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,009
ANTHRAX THEY'LL HAVE TO SHUT

288
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,378
DOWN THE HVAC SYSTEM TO THE

289
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,678
WHOLE BUILDING.

290
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:34,780
SO THE EQUIPMENT THAT'S GOING TO

291
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,649
BE BROUGHT IN IS GOING TO BE

292
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,683
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S BEING

293
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:43,355
OBSERVED BY FIRST RESPS.

294
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:46,359
THEY NEED TO VALIDATE THE RISK

295
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,095
BEFORE THEY REMOVE THE ITEM.

296
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,730
ANOTHER GREAT POINT RON POINTED

297
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,797
OUT, THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO REVAC

298
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,932
WAIT WHERE THEY HAVE TO.

299
00:08:53,932 --> 00:09:00,338
-- EVACUATE WHERE THEY HAVE TO.

300
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:02,341
AND THAT'S THE KEY PART.

301
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,010
SO THAT'S THE WINT YOU'RE GOING

302
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,379
TO SEE BROUGHT -- THE EQUIPMENT

303
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,282
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE BROUGHT IN.

304
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:13,085
THE OVERALL INVOLVEMENT FOR THE

305
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:13,686
ENTIRE AREA.

306
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,788
>> TELL US ABOUT THE STRUCTURE

307
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,491
OF A BUILDING LIKE THE TIME

308
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,191
WARNER CENTER.

309
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,626
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS ON ONE

310
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,495
FLOOR, IT WON'T NECESSARILY

311
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,363
AFFECT ANOTHER FLOOR.

312
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:24,897
IT IS THAT RIGHT?

313
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,999
>> -- IT THAT RIGHT?

314
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,734
>> -- IS THAT RIGHT?

315
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,270
>> THE TIME WARNER BUILDING LIKE

316
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,538
MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN

317
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:36,809
RETROFITTED IN THE POST-9/11

318
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,243
WORLD.

319
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,844
I CAN TELL YOU THESE BUILDINGS

320
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,781
ARE NOT DESIGNED TO LEAN

321
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:42,915
FORWARD.

322
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,084
SO GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENS,

323
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,118
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO COME

324
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:46,451
STRAIGHT DOWN.

325
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,521
>> LIKE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER

326
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:48,788
BUILDING.

327
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,489
>> THEY WORK WITH ENGINEERS TO

328
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,791
UNDERSTAND WHERE STRESS POINTS

329
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,358
ARE.

330
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,928
THESE ARE THE PARTS THAT NEED TO

331
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,730
BE PROTECTED MORE THAN ANYTHING

332
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:57,930
ELSE.

333
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,331
>> THAT WOULD FACTOR INTO THE

334
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,033
DECISION RIGHT NOW TO NOT

335
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,603
EVACUATE ALL THE FLOORS OF THE

336
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,571
TIME WARNER TOWER.

337
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,705
>> CORRECT.

338
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:09,375
AND REMEMBER IT'S WHAT THEY'VE

339
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,209
SEEN, TANYA.

340
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,045
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH.

341
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,814
RIGHT NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH

342
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,215
PACKAGES THAT ARE BEING

343
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,783
IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL

344
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,817
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

345
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,986
AND THANK GOD NONE HAVE

346
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:21,787
DETONATED, BUT THAT'S WHAT

347
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,821
THEY'RE LOOKING AT.

348
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,023
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT

349
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,891
COULD HAVE BEEN A BIOLOGICAL

350
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:26,192
AGENT.

351
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,561
IF WE SEE THAT I CAN TELL YOU

352
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:33,866
AND ASSURE YOU THAT HVAC SYSTEM

353
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,601
WILL SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY AND

354
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,270
THEY WILL EVACUATE THE BUILDING.

355
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,004
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AT

356
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,940
THE POST OFFICE IN THE D.C.

357
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,243
AREA, ONE SPORE, JUST ONE SPORE

358
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,511
OF ANTHRAX CAN GET THROUGH THAT

359
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,346
BUILDING THIS A MATTER OF

360
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:51,317
MINUTES WITH REGARDS TO THE HVAC

361
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,218
SYSTEM.

362
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,820
IF THAT HAPPENS YOU'LL SEE AN

363
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,387
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PROTOCOL.

364
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:57,490
>> THANKFULLY WE HAVEN'T HAD

365
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,758
ANYMORE INCIDENTS WITH ANTHRAX

366
00:10:58,758 --> 00:10:59,558
AFTER THAT.

367
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:02,294
IS THAT RIGHT?

368
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:02,561
I MEAN.

369
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,864
>> WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY MAJOR

370
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,433
SINCE THAT PARTICULAR TIMEFRAME.

371
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,301
THANK GOD, WE HAVEN'T.

372
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,838
BUT CREDITS TO JOHNS HOPKINS APL

373
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,940
BECAUSE THEY DID A LOT OF

374
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,208
RESEARCH THAT PROVIDED SOME

375
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,544
GREAT EDUCATION TO IDENTIFY AND

376
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,512
MITIGATE THINGS EARLY.

377
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,913
SO CREDIT TO THEM.

378
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,080
NO, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

379
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,315
MAJOR SINCE THAT POINT IN TIME.

380
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,752
>> I WANT TO UPDATE FOR

381
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:26,985
VIEWERS.

382
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,188
A PAIR OF SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES

383
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,056
WERE DISCOVERED BY THE NYPD ON

384
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,025
THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE TIME

385
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,026
WARNER CENTER.

386
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,462
AND AS IT NOW STANDS THOSE

387
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,230
PACKAGES ARE BEING INVESTIGATED.

388
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,998
WE'VE SEEN THE BOMB SQUAD ENTER.

389
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,034
WE'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF NEW YORK

390
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,836
POLICE DEPARTMENT TEAMS WITH

391
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,670
VARIOUS VERY SOPHISTICATED

392
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,672
EQUIPMENT ENTERING THE BUILDING.

393
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:48,941
THE SUBBASEMENT, THE FIRST

394
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,476
FLOOR, THE SECOND FLOOR, THE

395
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,611
THIRD FLOOR HAVE ALL BEEN

396
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:52,878
EVACUATED.

397
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,914
THE REST OF THE BUILDING HAS NOT

398
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,381
BEEN EVACUATED.

399
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,051
BUT THIS IS CLEARLY AN ONGOING

400
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,351
SITUATION.

401
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,452
RON, ARE YOU STILL WITH US?

402
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,953
>> I AM.

403
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:04,023
>> SO RON, YOU PROBABLY ARE

404
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,725
SEEING THE SAME IMAGES THAT WE

405
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,326
ARE OF ALL OF THIS EQUIPMENT

406
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:09,595
ENTERING THE BUILDING.

407
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,198
DOES THIS TELL YOU THEN THAT LAW

408
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,800
ENFORCEMENT HAS A HANDLE ON

409
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,702
THESE PACKAGES?

410
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,637
SORT OF K-9 OF CAN UNDERSTAND --

411
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,939
KIND OF CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY

412
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,806
ARE AND IS GOING TO DETONATE

413
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:24,210
THEM SAFELY OR SEE IF THEY'RE

414
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,544
GOING TO BE DETONATED?

415
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,713
>> I HAVE TO BELIEVE BY NOW THAT

416
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,850
LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS WHAT'S

417
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,619
BEEN PLACED IN THESE PACKAGES

418
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,919
THAT ARE DOWN AT QUANTICO.

419
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,188
THAT THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING

420
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,690
OF THAT AND THAT INTELLIGENCE IS

421
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,893
GOING BACK TO THE POLICE

422
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:41,193
DEPARTMENT.

423
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:41,693
AND THE NEW YORK POLICE

424
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:42,962
DEPARTMENT SHARED WITH THE FBI,

425
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,730
SHARED WITH THE SECRET SERVICE

426
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,032
AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS

427
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,835
INVOLVED IN THE JTTF RESPONSE NO

428
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,103
MATTER WHAT CITY.

429
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:57,042
BUT EVEN IF THAT WAS TO BE THE

430
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,344
SUSPECTED EXPLOSIVE, TURNED OUT

431
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,444
TO BE INERT.

432
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,881
I I THINK THEY HAVE TO RESPOND

433
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,415
IN A MUSCLED UP WAY PARTICULARLY

434
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,018
IN THE TIME WARNER CENTER.

435
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,753
PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE'S A

436
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,490
SUSPICIOUS DEVICE AROUND ANY

437
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,257
FUTURE LIKELY RECIPIENT.

438
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:15,294
THEY HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE

439
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,264
WHAT IF THIS PERSON -- LET'S SEE

440
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,300
THESE FIRST TEN DEVICES WERE ALL

441
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,500
INERT.

442
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,770
AND HE DECIDED, HEY, THEY DROP

443
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,771
THEIR GUARD.

444
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,673
THE 11TH ONE IS GOING TO

445
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:27,907
EXPLODE.

446
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:28,274
>> RIGHT.

447
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,609
>> SO I THINK UNTIL THEY HAVE

448
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,911
SOMEBODY IN HANDCUFFS, THEY'RE

449
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,346
GOING TO HAVE TO RESPON

450
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,180
AGGRESSIVELY, FULLY, AND

451
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,583
CERTAINFULLY A PLACE WHERE A

452
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,752
DEVICE -- CERTAINLY IN A PLACE

453
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,320
WHERE A DEVICE HAS BEEN SENT IN

454
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,720
THE PAST.

455
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,188
AND THAT WOULD BE THE TIME

456
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:43,521
WARNER CENTER.

457
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,591
>> WE HEARD THE MAYOR TODAY

458
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,626
SAYING YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY

459
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:47,892
SOMETHING.

460
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:48,193
CALL POLICE.

461
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:49,594
YOU KNOW, SO WE CAN PROBABLY

462
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:51,430
EXPECT AT LEAST IN THE NEAR

463
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,964
FUTURE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

464
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:55,100
PEOPLE REPORTING A LOT OF

465
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,333
THINGS.

466
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,236
SOME OF WHICH WILL PAN OUT TO

467
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,837
NOT BE WORRISOME.

468
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,006
BUT IT'S BETTER TO REPORT THAN

469
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,440
NOT REPORT.

470
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,375
BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY.

471
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,443
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

472
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,011
I THINK WE ARE MORE LIKELY IN

473
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,014
THE COMING DAYS TO SEE FALSE

474
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,181
ALARMS MUSCLED UP POLICE

475
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,751
RESPONSES THAT TURN OUT TO BE

476
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,585
NOTHING.

477
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:13,885
THAT'S OKAY.

478
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:14,185
THAT'S OKAY.

479
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,722
I THINK THE COMMISSIONER WAS

480
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,490
INVITING THEM, NEW YORK CITY,

481
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,291
LET'S GUESS RIGHT.

482
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,258
LET'S NOT GUESS WRONG.

483
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,561
>> HE DID SAY THERE'S NO CURRENT

484
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,929
INTELLIGENCE TO SUGGEST THAT

485
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,463
THERE IS ANY IMMINENT DANGER

486
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,366
FACING THE CITY, BUT THIS JUST

487
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,201
GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT

488
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,837
INTELLIGENCE OR NOT ANYTHING

489
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,806
COULD HAPPEN AT ANY TIME.

490
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,008
>> THAT'S VERY TRUE.

491
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,178
AND WE CANNOT FORECLOSE THE

492
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,380
POSSIBILITY THAT SOME COPYCAT

493
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,447
OUT THERE WANTS TO HAVE A LITTLE

494
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,017
BIT OF FUN WITH US AND SEE WHAT

495
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,519
KIND OF INFLUENCE HE CAN HAVE

496
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,054
BOTH ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

497
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,123
COMPONENTS AND ON THE MEDIA.

498
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,858
BECAUSE AS PAUL MENTIONED

499
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,627
EARLIER, SOME OF THIS IS ABOUT,

500
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:56,895
YOU KNOW, COMMANDING ATTENTION

501
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:57,963
AND POWER.

502
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:58,964
AND THE GRATIFICATION OF

503
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,831
WATCHING THIS RESPONSE.

504
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,166
LOOK WHAT I CAN DO.

505
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,635
LOOK HOW I CAN MANIPULATE.

506
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,604
THAT MAY WELL BE IN THIS

507
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,138
OFFENDER'S HEAD.

508
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,173
YOU KNOW, WE HEAR OF THESE

509
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,609
REPORTS WITH ARSON ITSELVES

510
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:10,943
SOMETIMES.

511
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,046
THEY LIGHT THE -- ARSONISTS

512
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:14,313
SOMETIMES.

513
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,447
THEY LIGHT THE FIRE AND THEY SIT

514
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,749
BACK AND WATCH IT.

515
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,083
THEY LIKE THAT.

516
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,518
THEY CONTROL THAT.

517
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,687
IS THAT A FACTOR HERE?

518
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,921
THAT MAY WELL BE.

519
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,556
LOOK AT THE MEDIA COVERAGE THAT

520
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,392
THIS PERSON HAS COMMANDED SO

521
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:26,992
FAR.

522
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,961
>> IT'S SO UNFORTUNATE THAT THE

523
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,262
PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGY OF THE

524
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,397
CRIMINAL MIND THAT FEEDS ON THE

525
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,831
ATTENTION AND COVERAGE THAT HIS

526
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,534
OR HER ACTS GET.

527
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,134
I'M WONDERING IF TONY WHO'S

528
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,170
THERE ON THE SCENE IS STILL WITH

529
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,470
US.

530
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,874
OH, WE DO NOT HAVE TONY ANY

531
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,107
LONGER.

532
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,009
PAUL, I WONDER WHAT YOU CAN ADD

533
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,978
TO THE SORT OF -- THE IDEA THAT

534
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,846
THIS COULD BE A COPYCAT OR

535
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,350
SOMEBODY THAT SORT OF IS JUST

536
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,286
PIGGYBACKING ON THE -- ALL THE

537
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,453
EXCITEMENT AND, YOU KNOW, DANGER

538
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:57,722
THAT WAS IN THE AREA YESTERDAY

539
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:59,458
AND SAID HEY, WOULDN'T IT BE A

540
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,261
GAS IF I GOT EVERYBODY RILED UP

541
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:02,528
AGAIN?

542
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,396
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK IT'S

543
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,263
HIGHLY PROBABLE.

544
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:11,470
AND FOR THE SAME THING WE COVER

545
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,305
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, WORKPLACE

546
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,006
SHOOTINGS YOU SEE IN A CERTAIN

547
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,442
PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THAT

548
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,143
ANOTHER INCIDENT BECAUSE THEY

549
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,045
RECOGNIZE THE ATTENTION THE

550
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:20,646
PREVIOUS PERSON GOT.

551
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,580
I THINK IT'S HIGHLY PROBABLE.

552
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,550
THE OTHER POINT TOO THAT RON

553
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,985
RAISED A GREAT POINT AS FAR AS

554
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,120
THE NOTORIETY HERE.

555
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,555
REMEMBER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS

556
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,390
CRIME SCENE, AND ONE THING I

557
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,325
THINK OUR VIEWERS WOULD FIND

558
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,526
INTERESTING IS THE FACT THAT

559
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:38,230
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN EXPECT NYPD

560
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,965
PLAIN CLOTHES DETECTIVES WALKING

561
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:40,732
THROUGH THE CROWDS BEHIND THE

562
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,768
TAPE TAKING A LOOK AND JUST

563
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,503
OBSERVING AND RECOGNIZING, YOU

564
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,171
KNOW, THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT

565
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,308
ARE IN THAT CROWD BECAUSE AS RON

566
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,211
POINTED OUT ABOUT AN ARSONIST,

567
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,111
IT'S HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT PERSON

568
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:55,013
COULD BE IN THIS CROWD ENJOYING

569
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:55,680
AND WATCHING THE POLICE

570
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,148
RESPONSE.

571
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,383
>> I WANT TO ADD TO WHAT YOU

572
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,717
SAID ABOUT THIS PERSON POSSIBLY

573
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:00,819
BEING IN THE CROWD.

574
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,122
I WANT TO POINT OUT THERE ARE

575
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,455
CAMERAS EVERYWHERE PROBABLY IN

576
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,391
THE TIME WARNER CENTER.

577
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:06,824
>> EXACTLY.

578
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,228
>> IF SOMEONE ASSUMES THAT THEY

579
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,363
PUT TWO SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES ON

580
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,098
THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE TIME

581
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,933
WARNER CENTER WITH NO ONE SEEING

582
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,800
THEM, I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY

583
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,502
MISTAKEN.

584
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,570
>> LOOK AT THE BEHAVIORAL

585
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,839
PROFILE OF A GUY LIKE THIS.

586
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,710
BELIEVES HE CAN HIDE IN PLAIN

587
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,977
SIGHT.

588
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,845
SO BY STANDING IN THE MIDST OF A

589
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,615
LARGE CROWD AND ASSIMILATING

590
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,851
INTO THE AREA, HE'S REAPING

591
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:33,118
ENJOYMENT.

592
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,319
HE'S WATCHING EVERYONE RUN

593
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,221
AROUND AND SCURRY AROUND BECAUSE

594
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:36,355
.

595
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,457
YOU KNOW, THE DEVICE HE PUT

596
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:39,724
SOMEWHERE.

597
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:40,959
>> IN TERMS OF INTERNAL

598
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,394
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN THE TIME

599
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,562
WARNER BUILDING, IS IT SAFE TO

600
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:45,964
ASSUME THEY ARE PROBABLY

601
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:46,365
EVERYWHERE?

602
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,000
>> THAT'S A FACT.

603
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,834
IT'S A CERTAINTY.

604
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,168
LET'S LOOK AT THIS.

605
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:52,104
IT'S OCTOBER 25TH.

606
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,438
SO PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND

607
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:54,139
THIS COATS.

608
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,374
THEY HAVE HATS.

609
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,475
PEOPLE HAVE BACKPACKS.

610
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,277
AND IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING UP,

611
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,411
THE CAMERA'S GOING TO SEE THE

612
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,679
TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

613
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,847
AND THIS INDIVIDUAL IS SMART

614
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,215
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT.

615
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,484
HE'S SENT 11 DEVICES AND NOTHING

616
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,752
HAS BEEN DETONATED.

617
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,819
HE'S NOT STUPID.

618
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:10,389
>> IF IT'S THE -- THAT'S A BIG

619
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,823
LEAP, IF IT'S THE SAME

620
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:12,123
INDIVIDUAL.

621
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,825
>> IF IT'S THE SAME INDIVIDUAL,

622
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:14,092
RIGHT.

623
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,293
IF IT'S THE SAME INDIVIDUAL.

624
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,229
BUT IF IT'S NOT, IT'S SEVERAL

625
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:17,629
INDIVIDUALS.

626
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,898
AND YOU KNOW, WE STILL HAVE

627
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,599
NOTHING THAT'S DETONATING.

628
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,367
THIS INDIVIDUAL BY PLACING

629
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:26,438
SOMETHING IN TIME WARNER TONIGHT

630
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,273
IT'S SUCH A LARGE VENUE.

631
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,708
IT'S SUCH A LARGE VENUE.

632
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,710
THAT TO WALK INSIDE WITH A COAT

633
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,512
AND HAT TO PLACE A BACKPACK DOWN

634
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,515
AND TO WALK AWAY AS CROWDED AS

635
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,452
IT IS ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME,

636
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,953
IT'S ESPECIALLY ON A NIGHT LIKE

637
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:44,790
TONIGHT IT'S NOT UNLIKELY A

638
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,959
CAMERA WOULDN'T PICK HIM UP ON

639
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,193
THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SIDE.

640
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,063
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT WE CAN'T

641
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,164
CONFIRM THIS PACKAGE WAS HAND

642
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,966
DELIVERED AND LEFT ON THE FLOOR.

643
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,068
WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT IN.

644
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,903
IT COULD HAVE VERY WELL BEEN

645
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,037
SOMETHING DELIVERED TO ONE OF

646
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,739
THESE STORES THROUGH THE MAIL AS

647
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:00,972
WELL.

648
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,841
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER

649
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,676
AN INDIVIDUAL ACTUALLY PLACED

650
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,645
THESE TWO PACKAGES INSIDE THE

651
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,078
TIME WARNER CENTER.

652
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:09,114
>> AND IF IT CAME THROUGH THE

653
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,849
MAIL IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY

654
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,218
CONSISTENT WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

655
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,020
>> EXACTLY.

656
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,253
EXACTLY

657
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:16,421
SO THAT IS A LITTLE MISSING

658
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,322
PIECE OF INFORMATION.

659
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,091
A LOT OF MISSING PIECES OF

660
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,026
INFORMATION RIGHT NOW.

661
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,494
BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY KEEPING ON

662
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,496
THIS STORY THAT IT CONTINUES TO

663
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:24,963
DEVELOP.

664
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,199
I MEAN, IT IS NOT -- THERE'S NO

665
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,900
INDICATION OR SIGNS YET THAT THE

666
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,736
POLICE ARE WRAPPING UP THEIR

667
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:31,803
WORK HERE.

668
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,337
>> NO.

669
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,705
AND AGAIN, THE THING THAT PEOPLE

670
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,507
NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND NOT JUST

671
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,508
IN NEW YORK.

672
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,876
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

673
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,077
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

674
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,512
THIS IS NOT A NEW YORK THING.

675
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,081
THIS IS A NATIONAL THING.

676
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,683
SO IT'S TO BE EXPECTED IN THE

677
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,085
DAYS TO COME AND NOT TO PANIC

678
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,821
OVER IT THAT VERY POSSIBLY A

679
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,289
BUILDING MAY REQUIRE AN

680
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,258
EVACUATION BECAUSE OF A

681
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,060
HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF ALERT THAT'S

682
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,763
BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN BUILDING

683
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,766
SECURITY PROTOCOLS BASED ON MAIL

684
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,333
SCREENING.

685
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,200
AND IT'S PROBABLE.

686
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,504
SO FOR PEOPLE NOT TO PANIC AND

687
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:05,871
CALMLY EVACUATE.

688
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,539
>> THERE COULD BE A LOT OF FALSE

689
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,244
ALARMS IN THE DAYS AHEAD AS RON

690
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:12,444
SAID.

691
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,546
RON, HOW LONG -- RON OR PAUL,

692
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,515
WHOEVER'S WITH US, HOW LONG

693
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,950
WOULD YOU EXPECT THIS PORTION OF

694
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,786
THE INVESTIGATION OR THE -- IF

695
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,255
THEY HAVE TO DETONATE SOMETHING

696
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:25,924
OR IF THEY HAVE TO REMOVE IT

697
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,360
FROM THE BUILDING, HOW LONG WILL

698
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,828
THIS PROCESS TAKE?

699
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,897
>> WELL, PART OF THAT'S GOING TO

700
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,466
DEPEND ON HOW CLOSE THE BOMB

701
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,401
SQUAD IS AND THEIR AVAILABILITY.

702
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,837
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY HAVE

703
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,871
CONTAINMENT VESSELS SCATTERED

704
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,807
AROUND THE BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK.

705
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,542
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE BOMB

706
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,810
TECHNICIANS SCATTERED AROUND THE

707
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,944
DIFFERENT BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK

708
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,380
EVEN THOUGH IT'S EVENING IT'S

709
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,350
NYPD, RIGHT?

710
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,683
NOBODY SLEEPS.

711
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,085
SO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

712
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,352
COVERAGE.

713
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,086
IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING THROUGH

714
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:55,320
TRAFFIC.

715
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,921
GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE THERE.

716
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:57,989
ASSESSING THE PACKAGE.

717
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,791
THIS IS NOT A BEAT COP WALKING

718
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,927
UP WITH A NIGHT STICK AND POKING

719
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,395
AT IT SAYING LOOKS OKAY TO ME.

720
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:06,331
YOU REALLY WANT TO GET

721
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,231
PROFESSIONALS IN.

722
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:08,300
THOSE ARE TRAINED BOMB

723
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,169
TECHNICIANS WITH THE TOOLS, THE

724
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,137
DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, TO GET UP

725
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,972
THERE VERY OFTEN TO PUT AN X-RAY

726
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,941
ON IT, TAKE A LOOK AT THE X-RAY.

727
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:18,944
THE FIRST ONE DOESN'T WORK, TAKE

728
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,078
ANOTHER X-RAY.

729
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,782
GO BACK TO, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT

730
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,984
DIAGNOSTICS WITH MULTIPLE

731
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:26,651
PEOPLE.

732
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,353
THIS COULD TAKE AN HOUR OR TWO

733
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,489
UNTIL SOME SORT OF ALL CLEAR IS

734
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,223
GIVEN OR THEY MAKE A DECISION

735
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:34,893
LET'S TAKE IT OUT AND RENDER IT

736
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,629
SAFE IF WE HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT

737
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,597
IT'S POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE,

738
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,799
LET'S GET THE CONTAINMENT

739
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,434
VESSEL, WALK IT DOWN, PUT IT ON

740
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,668
THE LOADING DOCK.

741
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,670
IF THEY CAN MOVE IT, THEY MAY

742
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,706
DECIDE WE NEED A ROBOT BECAUSE

743
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,275
THIS THING IS A LITTLE BIT MORE

744
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,344
CURIOUS TO US OR WE'RE MORE

745
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,512
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT

746
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:53,678
BE.

747
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:56,214
LET'S GET A ROBOT IN TO DO THAT

748
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,783
RATHER THAN A HUMAN BEING IN A

749
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,283
BOMB SUIT.

750
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,085
SO ALL OF THAT AND JUST REALLY

751
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,454
THE TRANSPORTATION AND GETTING
