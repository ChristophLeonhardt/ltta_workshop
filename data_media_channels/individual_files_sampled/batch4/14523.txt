when it comes to manufacturing make-believe content Hollywood reign supreme and then there's Hollywood's Indian cousin Bollywood but apparently there's a new player on the world stage when it comes to the fine art of fakery and forgery and it's based in the Gaza Strip of all places let's just say hooray for Hollywood aside from suicide bombing expeditions I've always been of the mindset that if Palestinians are world class at anything it is surely public relations and propaganda over the decades terrorist groups such as Hamas have successfully duped naive members of the world press into thinking that it is their membership who are the oppressed victims at the hands of the Israelis and as we witnessed recently only the likes of Hamas could stage a peaceful march to Israel's border that was anything but peaceful given that so many of the marchers were weaponized yes leave it to Hamas to make a non-violent march violent and then get Israel condemned as the aggressor simply for having the temerity for defending her borders from the advancing hordes of Hamas hooligans and to put the Palestinian flair for fakery into perspective just check out this video that's currently making the rounds it depicts Palestinians taking part in what can only be described as martyr practice it's unintentionally hilarious wow talk about shamelessly mugging for the camera too bad the Academy Awards already aired about a month ago and really who do these Palestinians think they are the rank-and-file of an Italian soccer team Euro 2004 the 92 page guide free on Monday in the Guardian now that was an excerpt from a cheeky TV ad for the Guardians 2004 euro cup supplement so in a sense it was a falsified distinction of practiced fakery that everyone in the soccer world knows goes on behind closed doors hey hey hey babe now the injury practice video is not a one-off by the way for when it comes to portraying Palestinians as victims the level of fakery knows no bounds check out this cropped image of an Israeli Defense Forces soldier actually standing on the chest of a young Palestinian girl the image caused worldwide outrage in 2012 when it started circulating around the internet and little wonder can it get any worse than that except for one inconvenient truth much like those stolen valor idiots who screw up when it comes to the nitty gritty details the Palestinian propagandists also got sloppy for it did not go and notice that the firearm being hoisted by the IDF soldier is an ak-47 something that's not regularly used by the Israeli army as well that uniform is not IDF issue either in fact a blogger was eventually able to track down the original uncropped photo now check it out look at all the bystanders just casually standing there in a ho-hum fashion I mean you think they'd be outraged that it would be screaming or yelling or crying given that this little girl is being stood upon by that IDF bully but no it was like they were just taking in street theatre and what do you know turns out that's exactly what this photo depicts a 2009 street theatre performance and Bahrain so the gun was wrong the uniform was wrong the place was wrong and the timeline was wrong in fact type fake Palestinian images into your search engine and you'll have reading material for hours folks bottom line let this latest video making the round stand as yet more tangible evidence indicating that whenever you observe any Hamas produced narrative regarding Palestinian victimhood please treat it with a shovel full of salt for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks you may have heard we have a brand new app here at the red bowl please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
