around 250 protesters at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pulled down a controversial Confederate statue the 105 year old monument known as silent salmon's long been seen as a symbol of white supremacy in the u.s. put up in 1913 it commemorated those who died fighting for the slaveholding Confederate states in the American Civil War the monuments polarised opinion on that campus for decades though it had been vandalized in the past although many saw it as a racist and offensive thing others argued maybe but it was nonetheless still part of the South's heritage and should therefore be preserved the University for its part condemned the toppling of the statue is unlawful and dangerous and did acknowledge the monuments divisive nature at least one person was reportedly arrested during the demonstration police are investigating what they're calling an act of vandalism the incident forms part though of a bigger picture here a growing backlash against Confederate symbols across the country and consisted emma-crats economics that centered the needs of poor indigenous african american and brown political activist Anton Rogers white and conservative radio host Dave Perkins join us to talk about the implications of the move and what happened and how society should deal with the vestiges of the Confederation period everything that happens here in the public square in public view is political it's a political plan involving street activity designed yes to divide us because there is an election coming up in just a couple of months a midterm election here where all congressmen and one-third of senators are up for reelection it is divisive because it is designed to be divisive because it's designed to activate the political base of the Democrat Party to get them out to vote in as high a number as possible on what's divisive is forcing people to have to look at something to have to embrace the white supremacy when they're going to school they're abandoning the historical context they're forgetting why those that you stand there who it was that put them there what the thinking was at the time and what the statues represent the history that led up to this or that person being remembered in a statute those statues were made to uphold history they were made to uphold white supremacy it would be great to see more conservatives concern about fighting slavery right here at home you have a president who has incited violence against people of color whose dog whistles of racism that become full-on on bull horns which have led to people like our sister on Heather being killed in Charlottesville last year we talked about freedoms but you're more concerned with a statue than you are with NFL players having the right to take a knee to stand up to racism and white supremacy that run this country the campaign against the statues as I see it as a way to get young people out and make them feel like they're doing something when they're really not accomplishing anything because the ghosts that they're fighting against is disappearing more and more every year we have to know where we came from so we don't do what the young people are doing today which is look at the present and see all manner of unfairness and injustice and feel like they need to riot in the streets and destroy things to make things right if they just saw history they would see how right everything is it's a matter of perspective destroy history ruins your perspective and that leaves you subject to being told what to think and having to believe it because you don't have anything else you
