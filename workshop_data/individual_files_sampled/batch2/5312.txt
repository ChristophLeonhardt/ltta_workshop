good evening from New York I'm Chris Hayes u.s. immigration policy is in chaos tonight thanks solely to President Donald Trump after the humanitarian crisis he initiated would through every federal agency involved from the Department of Justice to Homeland Security to Health and Human Services to now the Pentagon into pandemonium as over 2,000 children were for ostensibly no reason ripped from their parents and sent to facilities around the country scattered to the four end Britons and there are still no plans for you reuniting them today with a casual tweet the president then blew up plans by congressional Republicans who tried to pass an immigration bill there's no coordination among agencies with confusion along the border as officials try to figure out what they're supposed to do now the only thing consistent about the president's immigration policy is frankly its cruelty the Washington Post is reporting on the difficulty of reuniting children with their parents stay tuned that reporter of that story will join us later even as homeland security officials claim that five hundred children have been reunited since May it's unclear how many of those children are still being detained with their families and a new report from Time magazine reveals that u.s. Navy is preparing to build quote temporary and austere tent cities to house listen to this 25,000 immigrants plus more camps for a possible total of 119 thousand people one local television station reporting on the site currently under consideration for this job noted that Kelso Arkansas sites nearly 60 miles away from Pine Bluff and about two miles away from the our relocation center where more than 8,000 japanese-americans were interned between 1942 and 1945 new camps just down the road from the Japanese internment camps one senator from toured a tent camp that has already been set up and is operational Antonio Texas did not mince words well I think it's an internment site with tents it's a prison-like internment cyi meanwhile between lying about his own policy and blaming everyone but himself Donald Trump has been hammering on the idea that Congress must pass a new immigration legislation and then today literally as House Republicans were working on exactly that Trump tweeted Republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen women in November Dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solve this decades-old problem we can pass great legislation after the red wave republican congresswoman Ileana ros-lehtinen of Florida is retiring from her seat which apparently gives her the freedom to honestly describe what it's been like working with this president it's a policymaking by tweet that's what you say a Monday may not last so Friday just fear that tweet in the morning say no no by the days in because the days not over had kids only it's not even noon yet how many times could it change for more on what happened today on Capitol Hill and join them by Republican congressman Robert Pittenger of North Carolina I'm congressman do you agree with your colleague it's schizoid policy that it's chaos the president threw a grenade up to Capitol Hill today well I think the president hasn't here at a chaotic lack of leadership that was demonstrated for several decades and you know President Clinton mrs. Clinton President Obama talked about the issues related to illegal immigrants immigrants come in this country if they've got to address it nobody had the courage to do the thing about it but wait congressman let me stop you right there am I correct that in 2013 there was a bipartisan piece of legislation that passed the Senate by a margin of 68 to 32 the president endorsed yes but am I correct am I am I correct the Republican Speaker of the House did not allow that to come to a floor vote despite the fact that had majority votes what we do have was a catch and release not just see but I just want to make sure that we're on the same page about the facts the matter in 2013 you agree there was a Senate bipartisan bill that did pass extension page of reality we're no bounds making sure that we agree to the history here you do agree with that right history is 1997 judge Flores created this whole issue separating families no he did today we have a president who's trying to address the problem Chris least 15,000 people died in 2016 because of heroin overdose that is incredible I had a little girl down the street from our house she got caught up in all of this she's a sweet girl played the violin and it is absolute travesty can we just I'm sorry but that is horrible and what's happening in opioids or open borders have happened to real families okay which is established let's just establish you said that no one had the no one had the courage to take it on I just want I just want all I want I really just want to agree on the facts of the matter so we can enter in the rabid ends you do acknowledge that in 2013 there was a bill that passed 6832 in the Senate I am not making that up correct yes okay acknowledge the President Obama had a continual policy of catch-and-release Minh that we have open borders we do individual thousand illegal immigrants just in Texas alone congressmen who were affected you know that state with 675 thousand a criminal acts wait a sec you know do you these are real people that are being affected because of the policies of President Obama we're trying to stop that congressman where do you keep talking about probably the President Obama the president United States is Donald Trump and that's what we're trying to fix today okay but what are you trying to fix you keep saying facts do let me in let me ask this catch you release and Boyer's do you think the United States currently has open borders absolutely there's open border have you ever tried to cross the border sir yes sir I'm from Texas son yes I know what it's like and how many let me ask you this congressman congressman what does the Customs and Border Protection say about family apprehensions this year versus last year are they up and or down well they're discouraging coming because they see a president means billards are they up or down they are down because that's a person who means business that but what we've got to do is fix the border 90% of all the heroin that's coming across into the United States Chris comes from Mexico 15,000 people does nothing does nothing childres were currently the MEK the heroin sir is not coming from eleven-year-old Honduran children who are being taken across the river with their mothers I have 10 grandchildren these kids are precious I had one of my grandkids nine-year-old boy and washing with me today that's one precious child okay that's great I'm glad it was with you yes sir I am too but those children are a result of families wanting to come to this contract if you come to this country and you cross illegally then you're responsible to our laws we are countries that you think they should you think they should be separated know that there's a bad by a judge in 1997 does not require let me ask you this you just said rule of law I want to ask you one last question here do you know what the federal penalty what class of crime it is for first time illegal entry which is what ninety-one percent of these people are being prosecuted for that's a misdemeanor it's a misdemeanor let me ask you this do you know what the federal class of crime it is to materially omit information on your sf-86 is I don't have that but what I do know I can tell you congressman is a felony so can I see this if you believe in a really said the constants if you believe years ago cuz my daughter was hit by a drunk driver Latinos came across from Mexico came sailing through a red light uh-huh it hit my daughter if I hadn't been in a position to buy her a very safe good car my daughter had been seriously hurt or worse okay this was an illegal immigrant I was totally inebriated who they come across our border we need to protect and secure our country thank God for a president who gets it nobody else preceding him had the guts the courage to jump in where the sharks are and he knows that you and others are going after him every day sir because he is in an area that nobody wants to get into it is not an easy issue to resolve it has been it has been taken okay congressman thank you for that the history of the fact matter is it just George W Bush and Barack Obama tried to sign comprehensive immigration
