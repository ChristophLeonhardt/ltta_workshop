the Trump administration has been ordered to provide information to locate hundreds of missing parents to reunite them with their children a federal judge overseeing the court-ordered reunification of more than 2500 migrant children has ordered the administration to turn over a list of all parents deemed ineligible for reunification by Wednesday let's bring in ms NBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff for more on this Jacob are they going to be able to track down all these families and reunite them that's the idea mica but this thing is almost absurdly far from over on Friday the Trump administration basically declared victory saying that they had reunited by this court imposed deadline the eligible what they call eligible eighteen hundred and eighty something and it was eighteen hundred and eighty two children systematically separated from their parents by the Trump administration but remember the overall number was over twenty five hundred kids and what we learned in court from the Trump administration on Friday actually went down there and sat in this courtroom to listen to the judge talk to the Trump administration and watch them battle it out with the ACLU there are six hundred and fifty kids senator Blumenthal didn't know the number six hundred and fifty is the number of children that the government deemed ineligible to be reunited with their parents and just didn't reunite them by the court imposed deadline so now the judge has stepped in and basically said there are what are called missing parents he calls the missing parents go find them here's how we're gonna do it the government was refusing to provide the ACLU information a specific detailed information that would help them track down these folks in their home countries including four hundred and thirty one parents who were deported and can't get back to this country to be reunited with their children so the next step is now this information being handed over by Wednesday and them going to track them down so Jacob you said six hundred and fifty the the Trump administration say six hundred and fifty young children are quote in the eligible to be reunited with their parents ineligible on what ground how did they define ineligible right and well it's such a good question jail let me be really clear those children were separated in the exact same way at many of the exact same places that the kids that were deemed eligible were separated the only issue with these children is that they say some of these parents 431 of them were already deported that's it I mean they just got deported before they could get back together with their children that's the vast majority of this group another small portion of that group has some form of criminal convictions but we don't know why or what kind of criminal conviction and they really focus on 120 of these parents who they say waived the right to reunification with their kids but it's sort of a hard argument to buy because we know from affidavits filed in court that many of those parents say I actually signed those forms in error to give up my children I didn't understand them yeah they were in different languages Jacob are these judges raking these government bureaucrats over the Colts I can't imagine any judge with a thousand kids missing six hundred million is right now I can't imagine any judge rake and not raking these bureaucrats over the coals and demanding that they provide answers are they doing that of course and the bottom line is Joe we wouldn't even be here with a plan for reunification if it wasn't for this judge judge Sabra down in the Southern District here in California he said very clearly on Friday there never was a plan these were like a bunch of different stovepipes DOJ HHS the Department of Homeland Security they never even talked to each other so he said look step one is getting the eligible children back together step two is you guys going out and finding the missing parents that you basically said we're being eligible and we're gonna reunite if I the judge didn't even tell you to go do this and come up with an actual plan to go do this and then step three is that this never ever happens again and all these agencies that you would think would talk to each other they're all federal government agencies involved in the care of migrant children down at the border would talk to each other and then I'm been talking to each other he said this can never happen again was basically his parting thoughts on in court on Friday Jacob thank you very much and PBS's frontline is taking a closer look at this crisis with a new special entitled separated children at the border here's a clip featuring an interview with former acting director of ice Tom Holman when you heard the tape the publica of the children Waylon what was your reaction I didn't say no come on I did not hear the tape I've heard many children crying my 34 years I don't need your children cry can I play it for you yeah it's a young girl who asked to call our own she wants to call her aunt she has the number memorized how can you not condemn that look I've seen a lot of terrible things my 34 years well we have to address the border I mean do you not sympathize with her I'm a parent it's sad but when the government chooses from force of law and they separate the parents been prosecuted just like every US citizen person this country gets separated he gets arrested but people on different set of rules were able to England and front line correspondent Martin Smith joins us now Martin obviously quite an interview what what else did you find out from the former director of ice well look he takes a very simple approach to this it was it was abundantly clear after talking to them that he sees this as a simple case of there's a law about how you legally enter the country and he's going to enforce it and the president has accepted that kind of approach to this you know if you want to have a humane process of deciding who can come and who deserves to come who's fleeing violence and needs asylum you have to have judges you have to have a robust Asylum process the president says he doesn't want judges well that's what judges are for to judge whether or not somebody can has it has a decent case to make so Coleman simply says enforce the law did you and did you sense from him and do you sense some other ice officials and other people who tried to tackle this issue a frustration a belief that you hear out of this administration that people in the past have brought children up with them to make their passage into the United States easier you know he didn't he didn't harp on that and I have heard that from some but look you know I went down to Salvador for the making of this documentary and my producer was covering this for the last year was in Mexico Guatemala El Salvador these people are fleeing violence and these these children and their mothers or fathers need to get out of the situation's they're in they're not just looking to make this easy to get in what's the fate of these children especially if they can't be reunited with their families which sounds like is a is a legitimate possibility for a good number of them what will happen there how do we even know of their status right now how they're doing well it's an excellent question makeup we don't know we don't know what's going to happen we talked to one man who was put on a plane back to Salvador his daughter had been separated from him at the border he was told that she if he agreed to be deported she would be reunited eventually she was reunited with him but there are others who went back under the pretense that that if they agreed to be deported they would get their child back which is really a violation of their right to file a claim for asylum and have a have a court hearing due process but in any case you know some of the like was mentioned by Jacob they're they're people that speak key che which is a native language in Guatemala who were asked to sign a form in English they didn't know what they were getting into there were some that we're illiterate but these are people that that have legitimate claims from what I saw not by large criminals as is as they are described Martin Smith thank you so much the new frontline documentary separated children at the border premieres tomorrow night on PBS thank you very much thank you thanks so much so what let's talk about the politics of ice they're going to be talking to the director on the hill right now it seems most Democrats are trying to distance himself from comments others have suggested that ice the apology abolish yeah I mean look that that tape that interview is key is many Democrats certainly the main the kind of the base of the party that kind of common that come chillin tone of well you know this is sad but you know these people law that is gonna fuel this debate for Democrats of those especially those thing about running for president 2020 you've got Kirsten Gillibrand now you've got Elizabeth Warren strongly on the what we must abolish ice front you have other people like Senator Kamla Harris who says we got to fix it the fixing Isis is the easy position but in this Democratic Party where there's so much energy on the far left and in the base if you hear ski you're gonna have a cup of ice then what replaces I'm not all I want to all that for the moment all I said that the political dynamic here is gonna pull Democrats the left you got a couple of big voices who are saying we must abolish it it's gonna become a litmus test I think pretty quick Wow if you want to run for president you're gonna have to either say you want to abolish it or you want to really radically reformed it alright still ahead on Morning Joe we're gonna bring in a former federal prosecutor who has some sharp advice for the president's former fixer Michael Cohen and a retired judge who says
