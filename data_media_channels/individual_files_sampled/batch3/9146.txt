Tucker: THAT WOULD BE SHOCKING. THANK YOU BOTH. I HOPE YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THOSE. TED MALIK WAS AN INFORMER ADVISOR TO THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN. IN MARCH HE SAYS HE WAS DETAINED AT AN AIRPORT BY INVESTIGATORS FOR ROBERT MUELLER WHO TOOK AWAY HIS CELL PHONE AND ASKED ABOUT HIS TIES TO ROGER STONE AMONG OTHER THINGS. HE IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "THE PLOT TO DESTROY TRUMP" ABOUT THE DEEP STATE. GIFFORD COMING ON. GOOD EVENING. Tucker: WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE DETAINED, THAT'S KIND OF A REMARKABLE STORY. TELL US THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS. ESPECIALLY FOR YALE, OXFORD BUSINESS PROFESSOR TO BE STOPPED AT AN AIRPORT, TAKEN INTO A ROOM AND ASK QUESTIONS BY THE FBI AND HAVING THEIR PHONE UNDER A WARRANT SEIZED. I WRITE ABOUT THIS IN THE BOOK AS A POSTSCRIPT AND MY LAWYERS TELL ME NOT TO CONFIRM OR DENY VERY MUCH ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I'M STILL ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THIS CONVERSATION. Tucker: I DON'T UNDERSTAND, WHY WOULD THAT PUT YOU WITH LEGAL PERIL IF YOU BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT OVERSTEPPED AND DETAINED YOU THE LOGAN AIRPORT IN BOSTON, RIGHT? FLYING IN FROM ABROAD. THEY PULL YOU ASIDE, TAKE YOUR CELL PHONE AND ASK YOU QUESTIONS. YOU HAVE NO LAWYER PRESENT, IS THAT CORRECT, DURING THIS CONVERSATION? NONE AT ALL. Tucker: SO HOW WHY WOULD YOU BE IN JEOPARDY BY EXERCISING THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO EXPLAIN THE TRUTH? I HAVE EXPLAINED IT AS A POSTSCRIPT TO THE BOOK AND ACTUALLY DETAILED IT AND I'M TOLD THAT THE FBI IS NOT ALL THAT HAPPY ABOUT THAT FACT. THEREFORE, I'M NOT REALLY AT LIBERTY TO SAY A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT WHERE THIS STANDS AT PRESENT. Tucker: GIVE US A SENSE, WHEN YOU SAT DOWN YOU HAD NO LAWYER. IT'S GENERALLY NOT ADVISED TO TALK TO THE FBI WITHOUT A LAWYER. DID THEY JUST GRAB YOU IF YOU GOT OFF THE PLANE? WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THEM WHEN THEY DID? THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2 THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2I THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2U THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2E THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2, THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2A THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2S THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2I THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2S THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2Y THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2A THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2D THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2T THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2E THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2N DIVIDED ME FROM MY WIFE AND THEN SEARCHED MY BELONGINGS AND TOOK ME TO A SEPARATE BUILDING TO INTRODUCE ME TO TWO FBI AGENTS WHO ASKED ME A SERIES OF QUESTIONS. ACTUALLY IT WAS QUITE CHIT CHATTY FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. AS A FAN OF THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES THEY ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT OF THEIR VICTORY AT THE SUPER BOWL. Tucker: THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID TO MIKE FLYNN DURING HIS CHIT CHATTY CONVERSATION. THEY HAD A WARRANT FOR ALL OF THIS, I ASSUME, IS THAT RIGHT? CORRECT. Tucker: OKAY. WHAT DID THEY ASK YOU? AS I SAID IN THE POSTSCRIPT, THERE WERE VERY FEW SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS. SOME ABOUT INDIVIDUALS, WHAT MY RELATIONSHIP WASN'T TO THE CAMPAIGN. THEY SEEM TO KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. Tucker: DID YOU CONSIDER SAYING BUZZ OFF, I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS? I THINK HAD THEY GOTTEN ANY MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN IN FACT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE, BUT THEY WERE FAIRLY BENIGN. I'M A PATRIOTIC AMERICAN. A COLD WAR ERA. I WORKED IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. I WAS THE TOP AMERICAN IN THE U.N. IN GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, FOR FOUR YEARS AT THE END OF THE COLD WAR. I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO COOPERATE IN ANY INQUIRY. I DON'T THINK I HAVE MUCH TO ADD. Tucker: WHY DO YOU THINK THEY WANTED TO TALK TO YOU? MY PUBLISHER THINKS THAT THEY READ MY BOOK ON THE PLOT TO DESTROY THE PRESIDENT, WHICH IS IN FACT ABOUT THE CONSPIRACY THE FIRST IN AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE 1783 AND THE NEWBURGH CONSPIRACY THAT TRIED TO OVERTHROW A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Tucker: WHY DID THEY ASK YOU ABOUT ROGER STONE? I HAVE NO IDEA. I'VE MET ROGER STONE THREE TIMES I'VE MET ROGER STONE THREE TIME TIMES. HE DID WRITE THE FORWARD TO MY NEW BOOK BECAUSE WE HAD THE SAME PUBLISHER. HE GAVE AN ADDRESS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN WEEKS AGO AND IT WAS A PRETTY COMPELLING STORY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 2016 ELECTION AND WE HAD IT TRANSCRIBED. I HAD ATTENDED THAT LECTURE, AND WE USED IT AS THE FORWARD TO THE BOOK. MAYBE THEY READ MORE INTO THAT THEN IS THE CASE. Tucker: WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOUR PHONE? YOU SAID THEY HAD A WARRANT FOR YOUR PHONE? YES. THEY CONFISCATED MY PHONE AND I'M TOLD IT'S BEEN RETURNED TO ME AND I SHOULD BE RECEIVING IT ANY DAY. Tucker: THEY TOOK YOUR PHONE AWAY? HOW LONG HAVE THEY HAD IT? SINCE THAT DAY, WHICH WAS BEFORE EASTER. Tucker: I WOULD BE PRETTY
