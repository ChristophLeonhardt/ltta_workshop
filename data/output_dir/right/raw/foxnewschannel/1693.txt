00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:08,488
PICK UP FOR GOP IN THE SENATE.

PENNSYLVANIA, THINGS ARE

37
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:24,938
POSSIBLE.

38
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:25,606
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO BE MORE

39
00:01:25,606 --> 00:01:34,147
FOCUSED ON WEST VIRGINIA WITH

40
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:34,648
PATRICK MORRISSEY.

41
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:35,382
ROSENDAHL WILL TAKE OUT TESTER

I AM VERY REALISTIC, LONGSHOT

44
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:39,720
PENNSYLVANIA IS A BETTER

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,120
OPPORTUNITY.

00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:48,428
IT WILL BE A TOUGH PICK UP.

49
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:49,162
BARLETTA IS AN ESTATE THE PRES.

50
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:49,429
WON.

51
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:50,163
IT WAS TIGHT BUT THE PRES. DID

52
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:50,864
WIN PENNSYLVANIA AND IS STILL

53
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:53,233
VERY POPULAR WITH A LOT OF

54
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:53,567
CORNERS.

55
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,267
>> HE IS NOT ALL THAT POPULAR.

56
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:58,105
THE NEXT PAUL HAD HIS

57
00:01:58,105 --> 00:02:03,710
FAVORABILITY AT 39, 55 OPPOSED.

58
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,311
WHEN YOU ARE SEEING IN

59
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:05,012
PENNSYLVANIA A LOT OF STATES,

60
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,213
YOU SAW IT IN VIRGINIA IN THE

61
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:10,851
GOVERNOR'S RACE, THE BOY MORE

62
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:14,888
RACE, DESPERATE FOR A DO OVER.

63
00:02:14,888 --> 00:02:15,555
DEMOCRATS NOMINATED SEVERAL

64
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:22,629
WOMEN TO RUN FOR CONGRESSIONAL

65
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,363
SEATS IN PENNSYLVANIA, THEY BEAT

66
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:24,097
BERNIE SANDERS ON ONE HAND AND

67
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:28,335
PEOPLE SYMPATHETIC TO DONALD

68
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:29,036
TRUMP ON THE OTHER AND UP AND

69
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:29,770
DOWN THE BALLOT THROUGHOUT THE

70
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,605
STATE IN PENNSYLVANIA YOU GOT

71
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:36,710
VERY FEISTY FORMER VETERANS,

72
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,012
HIGH-POWERED LAWYERS, RUNNING

73
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,080
FOR HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,387
DEMOCRATS NEED TO PICK UP 23,

75
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:51,792
AND CAPTURED NOMINATIONS,

76
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:55,362
DISTRICT HILLARY CLINTON WON.

77
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:59,132
DONALD TRUMP WON BY LESS THEN A

78
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:01,735
POINT BUT IS NOT VERY POPULAR.

79
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:02,469
>> THE DONNELLY SEAT IN INDIANA,

80
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:07,374
LET'S GO TO THE SECOND TOPIC,

81
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:08,075
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PENDING

82
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:12,879
WAVE THAT HAS BEEN ALL THE TALK

83
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,115
IN NOVEMBER.

84
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:15,882
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE

85
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:16,583
LEFT THAT ARE VERY ANTI-TRUMP

86
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,618
BUT THE MESSAGING FROM THE

87
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:23,924
DEMOCRATS HAS BEEN LACKING A LOT

88
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:24,591
OF WAYS, PEOPLE DON'T LIKE

89
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:25,325
THINGS THAT ARE NEGATIVE, I HATE

90
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:28,762
TRUMP IS NOT SOMETHING PEOPLE

91
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:29,129
VOTE FOR.

92
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,766
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE WILL SEE IN

93
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:33,133
NOVEMBER?

94
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:33,867
>> A COUPLE THINGS I'M WATCHING

95
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:37,304
TAKE PLACE ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE,

96
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:46,179
AND RUNNING ON SOMETHING IN 2018

97
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:46,847
AND THE MESSAGE WITH NANCY

98
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:47,547
PELOSI AS WE WILL RAISE YOUR

99
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:48,148
TAXES, DISCUSSION ABOUT

100
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:48,849
IMPEACHMENT, A REAL DRIVE IN

101
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:49,516
SOME PARTS OF THE DEMOCRAT

102
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,151
CAUCUS FOR IMPEACHMENT TO TAKE

103
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,018
THE MAJORITY BACK, WE WILL BAN

104
00:03:52,018 --> 00:04:01,194
YOUR GUNS, LOOK AT THE ISSUES

105
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:01,928
DEMOCRATS ARE WANTING TO RUN ON

106
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:02,662
ARE NOT WINNING ISSUES FOR THE

107
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:03,363
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MORE THAN

108
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:04,030
CONGRESSIONAL GENERIC FULL

109
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,765
DEMOCRATS ARE UP DOUBLE DIGITS

110
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,134
INTO THIS YEAR AND REUTERS A FEW

111
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:14,141
DAYS AGO UP BY ONE.

112
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:14,808
THIS IS NOT LOOKING LIKE A

113
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:15,542
MASSIVE BLUE WAVE, MORE LIKE A

114
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:15,976
BLUE TRICKLE.

115
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:20,247
IT IS DOWN TO THE QUALITY OF

116
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:20,947
CANDIDATES, HOW WELL DO THEY

117
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:21,214
RUN?

118
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:21,882
DO THEY DO THE RIGHT THINGS

119
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:23,550
PUTTING TOGETHER A GOOD CAMPAIGN

120
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,184
AND THE RIGHT MESSAGE BUT

121
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:27,120
DEMOCRATS PICK UP SOME SEATS BUT

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,788
NOT TAKING BACK THE HOUSE.

123
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:33,560
>> A 5% LEAD FOR DEMOCRATS IN

124
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:33,927
NOVEMBER.

125
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:34,661
A LOT OF LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC

126
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:35,395
ANALYSTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS

127
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:36,263
WOULD BE HIGHER AT THIS POINT.

128
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:41,968
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

129
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:42,702
THE FACT IS A RECORD NUMBER OF

130
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:43,436
REPUBLICAN RETIREMENTS BECAUSE

131
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:44,905
REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE OF

132
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,907
REPRESENTATIVES DON'T LIKE BEING

133
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:50,510
IN THE MINORITY, DOZENS OF

134
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,512
DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGERS OUT

135
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:59,119
RAISING REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS.

136
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:09,329
THESE NUMBERS,

137
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:10,096
RAISING REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS.
THESE NUMBERS, SPECIAL ELECTION

138
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,530
BY 21.

139
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,264
AND 15 OR 16 OR LESS LAST TIME,

140
00:05:11,264 --> 00:00:00,000
OVER 100 AND ONLY TOOK 23 HAS TO
