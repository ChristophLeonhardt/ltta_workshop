1
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:06,799
WE'RE UP ON THE THE ON MEZZANINE

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,099
LEVEL.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,269
THE DOCTOR MAKING A HOUSE CALL,

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:10,836
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.

5
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:15,040
HE HAS A BRAND NEW BOOK, WHY WE

6
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:15,341
FIGHT.

7
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:17,209
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,178
THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION AND

9
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:22,481
CEREMONIAL SWEARING-IN LAST

10
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:23,149
NIGHT.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,017
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE TONE OF

12
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,254
THE PRESIDENT AND MR. KAVANAUGH.

13
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:29,421
>> I'M GRATEFUL WHAT THE

14
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:30,289
PRESIDENT HAD DONE.

15
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,858
A GOOD MAN A GODLY MAN, WAS

16
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:34,093
IMPUNED AND PRESIDENT DECLARED

17
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:34,527
HIM INNOCENT.

18
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:36,529
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

19
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,530
AINSLEY: IS IT WORTH THE FIGHT?

20
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:38,931
WE'RE SEEING HOW REPUBLICANS ARE

21
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:39,799
BEING TREATED.

22
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,500
YOU CAN'T GO TO A RESTAURANT

23
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:41,834
ANYMORE.

24
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:43,035
THEY'RE PUTTING OUT YOUR

25
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:45,070
PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOUR

26
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:47,039
ADDRESSES, SENDING --

27
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
BRIAN: DOXXING.

28
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,442
>> ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT.

29
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:51,477
1776 WAS WORTH IT.

30
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:52,478
THIS IS WORTH IT.

31
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,580
IN MY BOOK WHY WE FIGHT, I TALK

32
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:55,881
ABOUT THE FACT THIS ISN'T THE

33
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:57,183
FIRST TIME THEY HAVE DONE IT.

34
00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:58,851
PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED WHAT THE

35
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:00,886
DEMOCRATS DID, THE DIRTY TRICKS,

36
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:02,121
THE LIES, GUESS WHAT THEY HAVE

37
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:03,689
BEEN DOING THIS FOR DECADES.

38
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,559
A MAN WHITAKER CHAMBERS, 1948,

39
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,093
FIRST TELEVISED CONGRESSIONAL

40
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:09,495
TESTIMONY, STOOD UP TO TELL THE

41
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,830
TRUTH ABOUT SOVIET PENETRATION

42
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:11,931
OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

43
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:13,232
WHAT DID THE LEFT DO?

44
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,301
THEY ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING AN

45
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:17,369
AFFAIR, BEING A HOME SEXUAL,

46
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,471
BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS

47
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:20,172
BROTHER'S DEATH.

48
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:21,273
ALL OF IT LIES.

49
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:22,741
THAT IS 1948.

50
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:24,610
THAT IS YEARS BEFORE JUSTICE

51
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:26,111
KAVANAUGH WAS EVEN BORN.

52
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:27,313
THIS IS PATTERN.

53
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:29,281
WE'VE ALWAYS GOT TO RESIST THE

54
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:31,317
LIES.

55
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:35,421
BRIAN: HERE IS MOSTEL LAST

56
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:36,822
NIGHT, LET'S LISTEN.

57
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:38,224
>> THE THING ABOUT MAKING A DEAL

58
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,392
WITH THE DEVIL THE DEVIL BACKS

59
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:41,794
UP HIS BARGAIN, ALL RIGHT?

60
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,662
THE DEVIL DOES NOT WELCH.

61
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:45,364
TRUMP HAS DELIVERED FOR THESE

62
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:46,799
PEOPLE ON THE THINGS THAT THEY

63
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,933
CARE ABOUT MOST.

64
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:49,335
HE HAS DELIVERED RACISM FOR

65
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:50,369
THESE PEOPLE.

66
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,304
HE HAS DELIVERED MISOGYNY FOR

67
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:53,772
THESE PEOPLE AND NOW HE HAS

68
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:54,940
DELIVERED THE SUPREME COURT FOR

69
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:56,175
THESE PEOPLE, WHICH IS SOMETHING

70
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:57,343
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET FOR

71
00:01:57,344 --> 00:01:58,477
A GENERATION.

72
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,114
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF THIS

73
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:03,115
RATHER THAN THEY HAVE CONTROL

74
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:04,817
OVER ALL THREE BRANCHES OF

75
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,018
GOVERNMENT, WE'LL SEE IF THIS

76
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:09,121
REIGN LASTS FOR 30 DAYS, OR TWO

77
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,990
YEARS, OR 1000 YEAR REICH.

78
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:12,358
BRIAN: IS THAT THE VIEW YOU HAVE

79
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:14,894
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION?

80
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:17,229
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS PERSON

81
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:17,663
IS.

82
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:19,798
WE'RE USED TO THE CRAZIES BUT

83
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:20,933
THE THAT IS AN INSULT.

84
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:23,035
THAT IS AN INSULT TO PEOPLE OF

85
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:25,437
MY PARENTS WHO LIVED UNDER NAZI

86
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:27,873
OCCUPATION, MY PARENTS WITH

87
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:30,042
CHILDREN, WHERE NAZIS TOOK OVER

88
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:30,376
HUNGARY.

89
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:32,177
THAT IS INSULT TO 10 MILLION

90
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:33,879
PLUS AMERICANS WHO WERE FIs

91
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,283
WHO FOUGHT FACISM, MANY OF WHOM

92
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:37,850
DIED.

93
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:38,784
THAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE.

94
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,853
BRIAN: A FASCIST COUNTRY

95
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:41,887
WOULDN'T LET HIM SAY THAT.

96
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:43,522
>> IF DONALD TRUMP WERE THE

97
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:45,224
GREAT DICTATOR THEY PAINT HIM TO

98
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:48,961
BE THIS PERSON WOULD BE LOCKED

99
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:50,062
UP.

100
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:52,765
BRIAN: 90% FOR HIM INSTEAD OF

101
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,900
90% AGAINST HIM.

102
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,936
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BRIAN.

103
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,304
AINSLEY: HOW DANGEROUS IS THAT

104
00:02:58,305 --> 00:02:58,671
RHETORIC?

105
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:01,740
>> ONLY ONE PARTY NORMALIZED

106
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:02,875
VIOLENCE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS

107
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:05,311
AND IT IS NOT REPUBLICANS.

108
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,713
JAMES HODGKINS DID NOT WEAR A

109
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:10,449
MAGA HAT WHEN HE WENT TO THE

110
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,850
BASEBALL FIELD IN ARLINGTON.

111
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,119
HE WAS A BEN BERNANKE SUPPORTER,

112
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,654
WITH A RIFLE AND HIT LIST OF

113
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:16,956
WHAT, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, HE

114
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,792
ALMOST KILLED ONE OF THEM, STEVE

115
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:20,125
SCALISE.

116
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:22,428
LOOK AT VIOLENCE OF ANTIFA, GO

117
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:24,530
PREPARED FOR BATTLE TO THOSE

118
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:24,997
DEMONSTRATIONS.

119
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,632
THE RIGHT DOWN DO THAT YOU'RE

120
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,634
NORMALIZING SOMETHING THAT IS

121
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:29,335
UN-AMERICAN.

122
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:30,903
STEVE: TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

123
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:33,172
YOUR BOOK, "WHY WE FIGHT,

124
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:34,707
DEFEATING AMERICAN ENEMIES WITH

125
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,908
NO APOLOGIES."

126
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:44,516
YOU START WITH SUN ZHUO.

127
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:48,520
>> AND KALVITZ.

128
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:48,954
ON WAR.

129
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,956
IF YOU KNOW THOSE TWO PEOPLE YOU

130
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,524
CAN DEFEAT ANY ENEMY AND

131
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:53,859
PRESIDENT HAS AN INSTINCT FOR

132
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,195
THIS STUFF.

133
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,931
SO SUN ZHOU, USE POWER, STRENGTH

134
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:00,332
OF YOUR ENEMY AGAINST THEM.

135
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,034
NOTHING CHANGED IN WARFARE OR

136
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:03,569
POLITICS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

137
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,770
STEVE: DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS

138
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:05,437
THE ENEMY?

139
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:06,438
>> HE UNDERSTANDS.

140
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,173
LOOK WHAT HE HAS DONE.

141
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,875
HE MAKES A STATEMENT, PEOPLE GO

142
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,076
CRAZY, ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT.

143
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:11,844
WHAT HAPPENS?

144
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,113
A FEW WEEKS LATER A FEW MONTHS

145
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:16,415
LATER TURNS OUT TO BE WHAT,

146
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:16,715
TRUE?

147
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,517
THEY WIRETAPPED MY CAMPAIGN.

148
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:19,951
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,

149
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:20,785
WIRETAPPED YOUR CAMPAIGN.

150
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,654
WE FIND OUT.

151
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,758
FISA WARRANT ILLEGALLY ISSUED

152
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,493
WITH EXCULPATORY INFORMATION

153
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:28,494
KEPT FROM THE DOCKET.

154
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:31,597
WE HAVE THE WHOLE HOUSE OF CARDS

155
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:31,997
COLLAPSING.

156
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:38,604
I HAVE RARELY MET A MAN

157
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:39,838
INSTINCTUALLY STRATEGIC AS

158
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,272
DONALD TRUMP.

159
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:40,806
TALKING ABOUT ISIS.

160
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:43,142
WHO IS TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA

161
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:44,176
INVADING NEIGHBORS?

162
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:45,978
NOBODY SINCE DONALD TRUMP BECAME

163
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:46,512
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.

164
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:47,980
BRIAN: IN THE CROSS-HAIRS CHINA.

165
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:48,981
>> CHINA IS NUMBER ONE.

166
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:51,116
IN MY BOOK I TALK ABOUT ALL THE

167
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:53,085
THREATS AND TALK ABOUT JIHADIS,

168
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:53,786
TALK ABOUT RUSSIA.

169
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:56,121
THERE IS ONLY ONE STRATEGIC ONE

170
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:57,890
AND IT IS BEIJING BECAUSE THEY

171
00:04:57,891 --> 00:00:00,000
WANT TO REPLACE AMERICA AND THEY
