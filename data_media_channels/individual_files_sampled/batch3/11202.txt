and you came to our studio from the Luzhniki stadium you saw that cracking game between Germany and Mexico a deserved win do you think totally I think Mexico totally deserves the victory and Germany totally deserves the defeat one team was really really good and strong and committed and happy and intense and playing in the limits and another team was slow was predictive not enthusiasm no sharpness but I think the group is quite easy I think Germany is going to qualify and I think again we are going to have Germany going and we are going to have Germany in the quarter-final and probably in the semi-finals and probably in the finals but today they were really better ok all right thank you you
