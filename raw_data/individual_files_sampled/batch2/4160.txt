have the chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker Jane Mayer her new piece for The Magazine examines the impact of Russian interference and a powerful new case that it decided that decided the election we're gonna get to that in just a moment but first we want to discuss Jane your latest reporting on the new allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh give us Jane if you could a little context around miss Ramirez accusations reading deeper into it we're hearing that she spent some time working to remember exactly what happened and and there's even some people who were you know helping her remember exactly who it was can you fill in the gaps here and explain her accusations context sure thank you it is actually my my reporting partner on the story co-author Ronan Farrow who spoke with her but she did spend six days trying to make sure that she remembered this clearly enough to want to come forward and put herself into the middle of this just a you know a brawl basically politically she spoke with classmates to try to remember what you know talk to them about what they remembered and she had gaps in her memory partly because it was very upsetting and she also had been drinking at the time and wasn't sure whether this was the kind of image of herself she wanted to present but in the end she felt it was really important to come forward and she you know I think what you know stepping back the so far the story is being defined to some extent by the White House where there's a real imbalance of power you've got the White House putting out it's talking points Cavanaugh's people putting out their talking points you've got this woman who lives in Boulder Colorado who told her story to only one place The New Yorker and it's a it's a small kind of megaphone compared to what she's up against here and it's a scary thing to go up against this so can you give us a timeline Jane of when she decided to step forward had she been looking at the Cavanaugh hearings and and when did she decide to step forward or was it was it dr. Ford's coming forward that made her decide that she'd set forward as well no actually she didn't step forward this is the thing we called her we heard her name this is a story she did not ask for this she felt once asked she had to try to search her memory to really remember and say whether there was something here but but this wasn't her idea to come forward what happened is that 35 years ago when this incident took place people talked about it and people in that Yale class have been talking about it since then and there is I mean everybody here has been talking this morning about how there's no corroboration there's there's a very sober background source who was not part of the party was not drunk heard about it either that night he thinks or the next day when I asked him myself does he remember this and and and is he sure that Cavanaugh was the person he heard about in this he said to me I am 100% sure he's told he's mentioned it to other people in grad school over the years his classmates were talking about it in July before Christine Blasi Ford came forward we've looked at the emails they're chattering about it saying boy if the FBI investigates him they're going to be some stories here that are going to put an end to his nomination right way so just just to be clear we're we're not asserting anything other than what the New York Times here let me read you a couple of New York Times quotes and and and see how it lines up with this New Yorker piece The Times had interviewed several dozen people over the past week and an attempt to corroborate her story and can find no one with first-hand knowledge mr. Mehra's herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recall the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain mr. Kavanagh was the one who exposed himself that was the new times did she ever express any doubts to either you are Ronin that it was it perhaps it was not mr. Kavanagh judge Cavanaugh corona and she said she was wasn't absolutely certain she needed to make certain before she was going to say anything publicly she remembered the specifics the graphic specifics it was very upsetting to her and she tried to remember for sure who that man was who was in her face and so it took her a while before she felt she was completely certain though I have to you know with all due respect to the New York Times which is the best paper in America just because they couldn't get the story and speak to her or find the person that we found who remembered it from back then it doesn't mean it's not true you know it's and it doesn't I'm at any rate you know I think let me stop you there so who is the New Yorkers corroborating witness because the time says they couldn't find a corroborating witness somebody that was in the room at the time that had happened no this is we as we say in the story we we spoke to the people who are alleged to have been in the room and they kept saying things like either they didn't return the phone calls or they'd say I can't remember you know and this is why I think her call for the FBI is a good idea because sometimes something that people might say to a reporter is different from what they might say to an FBI officer of a perjury charges and I think it's a good idea you know it's a hard thing we tried very hard to put across what we do know what we don't know what the crossfire of allegations are it's all transparent in the story but it you know we tried to be completely forthright about it right and and Jane that's the thing the way it's written and and the way things unfold you can tell there's a woman struggling to remember exactly what happened there's nobody in the room that wants to go on the record and corroborate it and yet this is something according to the story that was talked about at the time that was emailed around after Judge Cavanaugh's name came up for the Supreme Court and Casey hunt chains exactly right and again we don't know what the truth is it's why we're saying there needs to be an FBI investigation but people will say one thing to a reporter they will say quite another to an FBI agent and of course the FBI they are not the super cops but they do of course have the ability to say tell me the truth or else you may be going to jail well and as Special Counsel Bob Muller and the FBI agents working with him or busily demonstrating if you lied to law enforcement bad things happen it is a bad plan and I think everybody realizes that you know that's it's more significant I mean obviously I think you know when they're speaking with Jane there's you know everybody wants to be honest in their conversations but I certainly I have a feeling I would be more careful and specific about recollections of any party I may or may not have attended in college but Jane I also wanted to ask you about something that's a little bit farther down in your story but that I'm wondering may not you know be something that resurfaces over the course of the next few days your report that you spoke to somebody about Mark judge who dr. Ford alleges was the other person in the room when the assault her assault took place and he is describing incidents with perhaps many women in the context of the Georgetown days and I was just hoping you could kind of walk through what your reporting is on that and and give us a little bit of context about why you thought that was important okay well so mark judge as you say is the other man he was at the time a teenager who according to Christine glossy Ford was in the room with her when she charges she was assaulted sexually by Brett Kavanaugh so he's the pivotal witness really at this point and what the what happened was I actually really received a call from mark judges former girlfriend college girlfriend who said and she's on the record here her name is Elizabeth razor and she was a Catholic University with him and she said I feel a moral obligation to correct the record here what he's saying about how there's no way that this could have happened because they only knew boys they only roughhouse with boys there were no girls basically in their lives she said mark judge told me that he it's a I don't want to say too anything to scuzzy on television but told me that he had sex when he was at Georgetown Prep with some of his friends all with the same drunk woman at the same time and and she's saying this on the record and she's a teacher now and she said I wouldn't betray confidences ordinarily but I felt it was just too important and I needed to say there's another picture of Georgetown Prep social life than the one that he painted and and he knows that well Jane I want to thank you for your reporting and for you and Ronan also you know really being able to get these facts put together along with mr. Ramirez's concerns and accusations but I want to move to your Russia piece because apparently all you do is work how Russia's helped swing the election for Trump tell us about your reporting there this is actually just it's a piece that's based on a new book called cyber war by Kathleen Hall Jamieson who is a the head of the Annenberg Center of public policy at Penn and it's a really interesting book and what she does is she goes sort of where others have sort of feared to tread she's gone back over the 2016 campaign looked at all of the data she's got polls of her own and all kinds of analysis and concluded that she said to me that she doesn't think Trump would be president without the help of the Russian interference in the election all right Jane Mayer thank you very very much for being on this morning we really appreciate it a lot going on thank you thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
