SPEAK WITH ME TOP TEN OVER THE
WEEKEND.
IT HAS HAD TWO REVIEWS IN THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
THIS IS A FILM AT THE MAIN
STREAM MADE YET DOES NOT WANT TO
COVER UP.
THEY DON'T WANT TO WRITE
ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT ABORTIO
ABORTION.

WHY SOME OF BUT TRYING TO
PREVENT THIS PRO-LIFE MOVIE FROM
BECOMING A HIT.
MICHELLE MALCOLM, SHE JOINS ME
NOW.
HE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN
PROMOTING THIS MOVIE.
WORKING TOWARDS THE FUNDING OF
THIS MOVIE.
DESPITE ALL OF THAT, IT'S
SUCCESSFUL.
>> IT IS.
IT HAS BEEN.
IT'S A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT
AND A TESTAMENT TO THE FORCE OF
NATURE THAT WHO YOU JUST SHOWED,
THEIR WHOLE TEAM AND A LOT OF
VERY BRAVE PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD.
SOME OF THEM ARE STILL
UNDERGROUND.
A LOT OF THEM COME OF THE CAST
AND CREW WHO BRAVELY PUT THEIR
NAMES AND REPUTATIONS AND CAREER
ON THE LINE TO TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN
PHILADELPHIA.
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE HORROR.
IT WAS A MASSACRE ON THE SIZE
AND ORDER IN PROPORTION AND THE
BARBARIC NATURE OF SOME OF THE
WORST SERIAL KILLERS IN AMERICA.
WHICH IS ODD MARTHA IS THAT MOST
OF THE MEDIA AND HOLLYWOOD OFTEN
HAVE THIS GROTESQUE FASCINATION
WITH SERIAL KILLERS.
NOBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HIM,
AND LARGE PART BECAUSE YOU
MENTION, THEY DON'T WANT TO SHED
ANY NEGATIVE EXPOSURE ON
ABORTION.
EVEN THOUGH THIS MAN COMMITTED
ATROCITIES AGAINST MINORITY
WOMEN, POOR WOMEN IN INTERCITY
PHILADELPHIA.
HE MURDERED DOZENS IF NOT
HUNDREDS OF BORN ALIVE BABIES
AND THERE WERE CASUALTIES THAT
INCLUDED REFUGEE PREGNANT
MOTHER.
THERE ARE MULTIPLE GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES THAT SAP WHY DIDN'T I
THINK EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE
AWARE.
>> Martha: THEY WANT TO DO
MAKE SURE THAT WRIGHT WAS
PROTECTED.
THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STORY.
TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
FACTS IS THAT ALL THE JURORS ON
THE CASE HAD TO BE PRO-CHOICE TO
BE PUT THERE BECAUSE THEY WANTED
THEM TO HAVE THAT PERSPECTIVE.
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF THEM BECAME PRO-LIFE
AFTERWARDS.
>> YES.
THAT IS CORRECT.
I WAS AT THE PREMIERE LAST
FRIDAY IN LOS ANGELES.
I GOT TO MEET THE BRAVE
DETECTIVE THAT IS DEPICTED BY
DEAN CAIN.
THERE WERE A LOT OF PRO-CHOICE
DEMOCRATS AND PRO-ABORTION
LIBERALS THAT WERE INVOLVED THAT
REFUSED TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO
THE HORROR HERE.
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THIS INDIE
FILM WAS CROWD FUNDED WITH
30,000 DONORS, $2.3 MILLION
RAISED OVER 45-DAY PERIOD AFTER
THE PRODUCER HAS BEEN KICKED OFF
OF PRO-ABORTION RADICAL
KICKSTARTER.
EVEN IN THE LEAD UP TO THE
PREMIERE, YOU HAD A FACEBOOK
BANNING PROMOTION OF ADS.
GOOD MPR CENSORING THE
DESCRIPTION, THE CLEAR AND PLAIN
DESCRIPTION.
AN ABORTION DOCTOR.
YOU HAVE A CODE OF SILENCE BY
HOLLYWOOD FILM CRITICS AND YET
THE WORD CONTINUES TO SPREAD AS
WE ENTER THE SECOND WEEKEND FOR
THIS MOVIE.
>> Martha: WE SHOULD POINT OUT
THAT THIS MOVIE IS RATED PG-13
FOR THAT --
A LOT OF IT IS NOT SEEN THE
MOVIE.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN
POTENTIALLY TAKE YOUR OLDER
CHILDREN TO.
THERE IS DOUBT ABOUT IT.
