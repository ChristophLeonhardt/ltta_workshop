Barossa if i this was not close thank you Trump had shockingly been very popular with Hispanic and african-american viewers of The Apprentice more so more popular than he was with white viewers hi I'm Joshua green I'm the author of the new book devil's bargain Steve Van and Donald Trump and the storming of the presidency I wound up getting his Q score files which showed he really connected with them as I went and talked to people African American executives at advertising agencies they told me you know it's not surprising to us the Trump was really popular with african-american voters back then because if you look at their portrayal at primetime television the mid 2000 they were still by and large presented as gangsters or rappers or entertainers but on The Apprentice african-americans were treated as ambitious entrepreneurs co-equal with everybody else and Trump with the guy overseeing all this and that is one of the things that made the apprentice and Donald Trump such a favorite of corporate America in all the big fortune 500 companies were advertising apprentice because they wanted to be associated with this positive multicultural television show that could really appeal to the broadest swath of the American electorate or the American consumer and so there was a moment in 2010 where Trump really could have run as a different kind of Republican candidate he could have embraced the critique that was later to Center the GOP autopsy the idea that the Republican Party is too old and white and crusty and needs to modernize and broaden its appeal to young people to minorities all the types of people's that are people that are allergic to the Republican coalition but instead Trump decided in 2010 2011 to launch off on his birth or rant you are not allowed to be a president you're not born in this country he may not have been born in this country and I'll tell you what three weeks ago I thought he was born in this country right now I have some real doubts which immediately plunged his favorability ratings with African American voters Hispanic voters soon followed and he transformed into the hard right anti-immigrant politician that he is today
