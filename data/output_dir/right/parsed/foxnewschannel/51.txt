>> NOBODY EVER HAD THE CONDITION
OF HAVING PRODUCED THE GREATEST
ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR
COUNTRY.
>> Martha: PRESIDENT TRUMP,
CONFIDENT IN THE BOOMING ECONOMY
THAT IT WILL HELP CONVINCE
VOTERS TO VOTE REPUBLICAN IN
2018 AND PERHAPS IN 2020 AS
WELL.
HAD PEREZ ASSESSOR OBAMA WAS
QUICK TO JUMP BACK
THIS WEEK AND SAY, NOT SO FAST.
>> WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT ECONOMIC MIRACLES RIGHT
NOW.
REMEMBER WHO STARTED IT.
>> Martha: HERE NOW,
LARA TRUMP, CAMPAIGN ADVISOR TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ALSO HIS
DAUGHTER.
YOU BEEN CAMPAIGNING HARD IN
MICHIGAN.
PRESIDENT OBAMA, VERY MUCH BACK
ON THE SCENE.
HE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE
EVERYBODY THAT THIS ECONOMY IS
IN HIM THAT HE.
>> MUST BE PRETTY HARD TO BE
PRESIDENT OBAMA, TO BEEN THERE
FOR 18 YEARS.
HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO
MUCH I DID TELL THE PEOPLE OF
THIS COUNTRY THAT THE BEST THEY
CAN EXPECT IS 2% GROWTH.
THAT WAS THE NEW NORMAL.
AND THEN TO SEE DONALD TRUMP
COME IN AND LESS THAN TWO YEARS
IN A 4% GROWTH.
TO SEE THE WAY THAT THE STOCK
MARKET HAS HIT RECORD HIGHS,
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT RECORD LOWS.
THAT MUST BE A LOT TO SWALLOW
FOR HIM.
IT IS PRETTY FUNNY TO SEE HIM
TRY TO TAKE CREDIT.
DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TRY TO SPACE
THEMSELVES AWAY FROM
REPUBLICANS.
>> Martha: I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
OUT TO A LOT OF CAMPAIGNING.
I KNOW FROM 2016 THAT YOU ALWAYS
FELT THAT YOU WOULD A FEEL FOR
WHAT WAS GOING ON OUT THERE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MIDTERM
NUMBERS, THE LATEST SORT OF FEEL
FOR IT IS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE
IT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID NOT HAVE A
BIG CROWD.
AND THE RALLY LAST EVENING.
IT WAS POINTED OUT IN SEVERAL
PLACES ON THE INTERNET THIS
MORNING THAT THERE WERE SOME
EMPTY SEATS THERE.
I KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T
LIKE TO BRAG ABOUT THE CROWD.
WE WILL MENTION IT.
WHAT YOU SEE OUT THERE?
WHAT IS YOUR FIELD FOR THIS
MIDTERM RACE?
DO YOU THINK AND IT IS DOES THE
PRESIDENT THINK THAT REPUBLICANS
CAN ACTUALLY HOLD THE HOUSE
>> YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.
I HAD A FEEL FOR THE COUNTRY AND
2016.
IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT BY THE WAY
THAN WHAT ALL OF THE MAINSTREAM
MEDIA WAS REPORTING.
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THE
PRESIDENT AT 1% CHANCE OF
WINNING THE ELECTION.
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY.
EVERYBODY DURING THE CAMPAIGN
WHO WAS OUT IN THE COUNTRY
TALKING TO PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD
THAT.
IT IS THE SAME THING NOW MARTHA.
YOU ARE RIGHT.
WE DO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE
RSVP FOR THE PRESIDENT'S RALLY
LAST IN HOUSTON.
THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED.
WE'VE BEEN DOING THESE RALLIES
FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW AND
HE HAS NOT SEEN THAT MANY PEOPLE
EVER RSVP FOR A RALLY.
IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.
IF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY
VERY MOTIVATED.
AND OF THE DEMOCRATS WHAT ABOUT
THE MEDIA, THE REALITY IS THAT
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY
DON'T GET OUT AND VOTE FOR
REPUBLICANS IN THIS MIDTERM
ELECTION, ALL THE PROGRESS THAT
WE HAVE SEEN UNDER
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IF THEY DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL
WILL TRY TO IMPEACH THIS
PRESIDENT.
I THINK PEOPLE ARE TAKING IT
VERY SERIOUSLY.
EVERYWHERE I HAVE GONE PEOPLE
ARE REALLY EXCITED TO BOATS.
THEY'RE EXCITED TO VOTE
REPUBLICAN.
PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE KNOCKING
DOORS AND MAKING PHONE CALLS.
>> Martha: WE WILL SEE, SOME
OF THE EARLY VOTING NUMBERS SHOW
SOME MOMENTUM.
ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY END UP
RUNNING AGAINST, THERE ARE QUITE
A FEW OF THEM WHO ARE POSSIBLY
IN THAT GROUP OF 20.
CAMILLA HARRIS IS IN IOWA RIGHT
NOW.
SHE IS GETTING A LOT OF POSITIVE
RESPONSE.
SHE WAS MEETING WITH SOME
VOTERS.
LET'S SHOW THE VIDEO OF HER
TALKING TO VOTERS ON THE
SIDEWALK FOR A MOMENT.
>> IT IS NEVER TOO EARLY.
>> Martha: THE CAMPAIGNER WITH
THE BABY VIDEO.
HERE'S A REPORTER WHO WAS
COVERING IT FOR CNN.
WATCH THIS.
>> SHE HAS GOTTEN A ROCK STAR
RECEPTION.
LAST NIGHT AND TOMORROW AND YOU
COULD FEEL THAT ELECTRICITY
AMONG ABOUT 500 PEOPLE WHO
SHOWED UP TO SEE HER AT THE END
OF THAT EVENT, THEY WERE JUST
LIKE MOVING TOWARDS HER IN A
HUMAN CRUTCH.
A LOT OF LOVE FOR HERE IN IOWA.
>> Martha: WHAT HE THINK ABOUT
THAT?
>> IT IS CNN, WHAT ELSE ARE THEY
GOING TO SAY?
OF COURSE THEY WILL THINK SHE IS
THE MOST WONDERFUL THING TO EVER
HAPPEN.
WHAT WE HAVE MARTHA AS A RESULT.
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS
DELIVERING FOR THE PEOPLE OF
THIS COUNTRY.
I THINK EVEN PEOPLE WHO DID NOT
VOTE FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
IN 2016 ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR
HIM IN 2020 BECAUSE THEIR LABS
ARE CHANGING FOR THE BETTER.
THEY HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR
POCKETS.
THEIR 401(K) IS GOING UP.
THEY COULD FINALLY SEND THEIR
KIDS TO COLLEGE PRODUCE ME
BETTER FOR THEIR FAMILY.
TAKE A FAMILY VACATION FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN YEARS.
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY WANT TO FEEL.
THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS
COUNTRY IS SAFER.
UNDER TRUMP, ALL OF THAT IS TRU
TRUE.
I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHO IS
GOING TO RUN ON THE DEMOCRATIC
AND IN 2020, BUT I THINK IT IS
GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY HARD TO
DEFEAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.
>> Martha: YOUR CAMPAIGN HAS
BROUGHT IN $100 BILLION AT THIS
