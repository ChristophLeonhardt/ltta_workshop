the happiness equation is actually a simple survival mechanism that our brains use all the time to compare events to expectations to make sure that we're safe we're in the safe zone hi I'm mo I'm chief business officer of Google X and currently on a mission to make a billion people happy a founder of 1 billion happy dot org and author of salford for that the happiness equation is the as your happiness is equal to or greater than the difference between the events of your life and your expectation of our life should behave so simple examples of the happiness equation right I am here at in London I expect it to rain right if it rains I wouldn't be feel disappointed if it doesn't I will feel happy because the event meets my expectations the opposite is also true if I so badly want the weekend to be sunshine because I can go out and spend time in the outdoors with my friends and it trains I will be disappointed the rain on its own is not capable of making me happy or unhappy it's rain as compared to my expectation of how the day will be that is making me unhappy or happy should we actually look at the mathematics of this equation and say one easy way to go through life is to have low expectations yes unfortunately it's true with the mathematics of the happiness equation and our actual experience in life proves that if you have low expectations you're mostly going to be happy if you don't expect life to give you much whatever life will give you will make you happy right one of my favorite concepts of salt for happy comes to the surface okay that concept is a concept I call committed acceptance committed acceptance is not only to accept the harshness of life but to commit after you accept and what that means is first you say ok something happened I cannot do anything about it but I'm going to try to do my best to make tomorrow a little better than today and after tomorrow a little better than tomorrow that committed acceptance may not fix the real issue wait but it will definitely make your life continue to be better and better and in the process because you're engaged in action and in thinking and in analysis and in problem-solving you will not feel the unhappiness as a result
