if you're wondering whether or not ice agents are spending their time and resources going after criminals and deporting them you would be wrong in fact a recent story indicates that they thought it would be a great idea to follow a ten year old with cerebral palsy all the way to the hospital stand outside of her hospital room as she underwent gallbladder surgery and then immediately detained her after she was well enough to leave the hospital and she has been in a shelter ever since waiting on deportation her name is Rosa Maria Hernandez and she was brought into the United States when she was just three months old she had to be rushed to the hospital for an emergency surgery and as a result went through a Border Patrol checkpoint and at that point they realized that she was undocumented and that was when everything transpired so the family members say that the agents at first refused to even allow them to close the the door of the room that she was in and they would not leave anywhere Maria went they went and Maria's I'm sorry Rosa Maria's doctor I'm sorry t-shirts say that even though she's ten years old because of her condition she has the brain function of a four to five year old and so she is not a threat to anyone by any means but it doesn't matter this is what ice officials are spending their time on so for those of you who don't live the near the border or I've not been there you might be confused like well if she's got a border checkpoint she's by definition just coming into the country that is actually not true there are border checkpoints deep into the country so a lot of American citizens in places like Texas live below the checkpoints and so that's why she had never had to travel past the checkpoint before even though almost her entire life has been lived in the state of Texas yes so this happened in Laredo Texas and there has been absolutely no empathy from the Border Patrol agents who were involved in this in fact there was a spokesperson for the Laredo sector Border Patrol and they said that they are committed to enforcing the immigration laws of this nation for the immigration laws of the United States once medically cleared rosamaria will be processed accordingly and by the way they won't even allow her to be with her mother she's in the shelter her family has no word about the conditions of this shelter they're not able to communicate with her and they're thinking that they're she's just gonna get deported it's insane and it looks like not the only case yeah you know we know that they're detaining grandmothers and people with children and separating families I just have one word which is scumbag I mean these guys are scumbags I understand that you know that there's a hiring whatever like a hiring spree at ice and on the border but if you're involved in this kind of stuff like how do you I don't know how do you sleep how do you look at yourself in the mirror this is these are not the people who are threatening the United States nor our undocumented immigrants we know the stats show they are not disproportionately threatening Americans any more than we threatened ourselves yeah I mean extreme levels of violence towards immigrants has been a normal part of this country for maybe just two and a half decades you know millions of people deported which is just an incredibly traumatic process for anyone I mean if you can imagine what it must be like to forcibly removed from your country the country that you're living in whatever that may be and sent back you know across the border off into very violent areas this is just like a you know the tip of the iceberg or is it a very extreme example and show is just just how fanatic and ideologically driven these agencies can be in their zeal to deport anyone and anyone they can get their hands on so the only slight disagreement I'll have with you guys is that I think and I don't it's probably not a disagreement I think the person culpable hill here is the people who gave the orders in the first place so I know it's not an excuse of they're following orders but to me the agents are far less culpable for carrying out the orders and the guy who gave the orders so Trump had promised oh don't worry I'm only going to take out immigrants undocumented immigrants with a criminal background but he lied and they've now doubled the number of people that they have deported that have no criminal background at all and obviously this young 10 year old girl does not and she came over as we pointed out when she was three months old so her to send her back to her country she's never known any country but America and so you can say why I don't Karen and I don't care if she's sick okay fine then then maybe the adjectives that Francesco use does apply to you if you're that heartless now it's not to say that there shouldn't be a rational solution for how we handle this overall problem but if you think yeah no I don't care that they don't have a criminal background I don't care this is only country they've ever been I don't care that they're sick they should be guarded like there's some sort of fugitive and then put into these detention centers well you know you should watch the movie that we actually just aired on youtube.com slash The Young Turks from brave new films so they did a movie called immigrant prisons and I helped in the premiere and and I heard all the stories of people who have been in these detention centers it is brutal and and some people and there's no due process one guy stayed in one of these detention centers for over nine years he he didn't have a criminal background he didn't anything wrong he actually wanted eventually staying but he says you have no rights when you go doing not a prison but to a detention center you could stay there indefinitely and they have no idea how long Rosa Maria Hernandez is gonna stay there she's without her mom a god knows the state that she's in and I one of the the guys that I talked to after the movie immigrant prisons was someone who had spent time at a detention center here in California he's a pastor and again he came over when he was a kid the only country has ever known as this one and and he set up a church here etc and he had gone with his kids like he always does to check in because he's trying to do the right thing and his five-year-old a seven year old watch him get arrested then he gets sick inside the the center and they never give him treatment he almost died because they don't care and see a lot of them are private so they're like well treating you would cost me money and this is a private corporation I don't want to spend any money I just want to house you for as long as I can so I want to go back and just comment on you know the portion of the American electorate that looks at stories like this and has absolutely no sympathy whatsoever for this ten year old girl who by the way think about how scary it is to have surgery when you're ten years old and then add the extra layer of like horrific behavior by these Border Patrol agents who are standing outside the door guarding it as she's going through something pretty scary and then afterwards she's separated from her family and thrown into a shelter where she doesn't know what her fate is right she's ten years old but okay you don't have any of empathy and I think a lot of people justify it by saying well these people come in and then you know they take our resources and you know taxpayer money helps fund these types of whatever you know they'll come up with some sort of justification right which by the way on a federal level aside from getting help when they go to emergency rooms they don't get any type of government assistance that is a huge lie on a state basis states make decisions whether or not they give some aid but on a federal level that is not the case but here's the thing what are your priorities are your priorities to go after a ten year old or maybe oil companies that profit an insane amount and still get subsidized by the government right or I don't know countries that don't deserve our foreign aid getting billions of dollars a year in foreign aid as they break international laws like that's the kind of stuff that we should be concerned about that's where the real money goes or the fact that the Defense Department continues to get more and more of our funding just so private contractors can make more and more money like that's where the money goes wake up it's I just the thing that drives me crazy is that we continuously go after the powerless right I get it we're all frustrated we want better lives for ourselves and for our families but you don't get that better life for yourself by
