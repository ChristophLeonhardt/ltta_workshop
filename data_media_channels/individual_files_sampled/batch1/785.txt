hello I'm Haslam seeker this is counting the cast on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week we talked to IMF chief Christine Lagarde on the changing economic winds here in the Middle East can island break Greg's if we look at how the Emerald Isle is caught in the middle of a big Rao between the UK and the EU plus a nation in motion it's the year of the dog in the world's second biggest economy so the economy of the Arab world is changing we've been reporting how many countries are having to diversify away from their oil dependency and plan for a different kind of future young people and women are demanding a more inclusive role in that society one of the advisors to governments in the region is the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde managing director of the IMF was in Doha this week I asked her how the IMF sees its role in the region and what it's learned from past experiences it has been criticized in the past for putting pressure on countries to impose austerity policies that bring pain for poorer people and benefit bankers I think the IMF is a slightly different institution from the days that you're referring to and clearly in the past few years we have been focused on a new set of topics number one we care very much about what I call the social safety net so whenever we give policy advice whenever we finance programs we always ask the leaders and I see them on a regular basis we always ask the leaders to really be mindful of those that are most exposed of the poor of the underprivileged of those that are likely to suffer as a result of potential fiscal consolidation that are sometimes needed you know when a country comes to the IMF and asks for a program we're lending international money and as a consideration for that we're asking that country to restore its public finance but we always say watch out the social safety net that you need to put in place is critically important let me give you an example when we ask a country to remove its subsidies on oil for instance we first of all ask the country and its authorities to put in place the cash transfer mechanism the special support that will be given to the most exposed doesn't mean that you replace it for everyone there are people who can afford to pay for the oil prices at full price but there are lots of people also who need the cash benefits who need the welfare benefits and we always focus on that the second area where we have focused lately is the role of women in societies and how they can contribute to the economy and how they need to be integrated and how they need to be included we do the same thing with young people which is particularly important in this part of the world glad you brought the women because that gets to my next question the role of women and the gender pay gap of course has been very much in the news recently you're considered one of the most powerful women in the world what advice would you give to young women in the Middle East trying to make their way in the workforce particularly in sectors of the economy that are still very much dominated by men well because I care about this region of the world and because I visit very often my first advice would not be to the young woman it would be through the leaders of those countries and my advice would be first of all look at you legal structure you legal Arsenal are the laws providing equality for men and women second I would say look at your budget are you providing for parental leave are you providing for childcare centers are you helping the woman access or stay on the job market so that would be my first my first call to the leaders because policies can actually change the map and I would also say to them and to people if I can reach out to them change your mindset consider how valuable women can be for your economy how much additional growth they and provide how much more sustainable that growth will be how more resilient it will be and how much inequality you're going to eliminate then I would turn to the woman my sisters and I would encourage them to number one get as much education as they can and I hope that this is accessible in the country where I talk to them not always the case I would second say have enough self-esteem take confidence in what other women in the area or Beyond can achieve and just be yourself and make sure that you have a voice and if you can't find your voice get the support of other men and women who will be supporting you along the way as you know there is an ongoing blockade against Qatar right now by a number of Arab countries that has been in place since since June of last year and I know in your capacity as managing director of the IMF this is beyond your remit to get into the politics of this but I want to ask you how concerned are you about the economic impact that this is having potentially having in the region the longer it goes on well first of all like in any other similar situations we very much hope that this these differences and the current situation can be remedied and that they can be reconciliation second we have observed very carefully how the authorities have reacted in in Qatar and they've taken prompt Swift efficient action to the point that as we are going through the review of the economy as we speak we are seeing rather low impact from this this boycott that we have seen in action we talked a little bit earlier about the IMF policies the austerity policies and so on let me bring up a one country that is going through that right now which is of course Egypt Egypt is now in the second year of this three-year twelve billion dollar aid package from the IMF how do you assess the the progress there because there has been a lot of the economic pain that I was talking about reducing the the subsidies and inflation and so on the country has finally decided to take a number of reforms that will take it to a positive productive job rich situation in the future it's not yet there but it's clearly the objective at the end of the of the journey and that journey implied some difficult and courageous economic decisions one was to float the currency which had been pegged to the dollar for a long period of time which cost the country a lot of reserve the decision was made to float which inevitably leads to increased inflation but inflation has gone down it when it peaked to about 30% it is now down to about 17 we expect it to be down to less than 12% at the end of the year growth has picked up significantly and is now cruising at about 5% which is much more than was that prevailed before the program came into place the subsidy program has also been revisited significantly and cash transfers have been put in place for eight million families which means roughly 20 million people which are now benefiting from this substitute to the subsidies now clearly the Egyptians people are taking the burden of that and are seeing the income slightly reduced for some of them in particular but our hope is that the Egyptian decisions the Egyptian reforms that are put in place will actually lead to an improved situation the reserves are coming back to the country the direct investments including from abroad are increasing as well so it's you know the foundations are now being set up in order to operate a better and more prosperous economic model going forward but how long will it be before enough people in Egypt will see the benefit of the things that you're talking about those figures you bring when you take stick in Egypt they're not seeing is not signature no because they are still going through that phase of transition and improvement of the foundations so that then once the investments are made jobs are created people have access to the market and can can can do better but I'm convinced that it will be improved over the course of time another criticism that's been made of the IMF as an institution is that it's been too kind of Western dominated this kind of rich man's club that doesn't truly reflect the goal the global economy what's the IMF doing to try and change that image well we have we have a mechanism in place that allows for evolution of its capital structure and its board composition I'll give you an example all big five emerging market economies now are in the top five shareholders of the IMF if you will and this region is representing more than 7% of its shareholding and three if I recall of my twenty four board members are from this part of the world so we have a very diverse representation it is true that there is still a you know a dominant representation of advanced economies but this is changing when you have the five emerging countries in the world in the top ten shareholders of the institution you can tell that there is a process in train that that will continue because that's part of the of my my obligations in the institution that it reflects gradually over time the actual state of the economy and the economy has changed just going back to the Middle East finally it's well known there is a need in the region for economies to diversify away from oil and one of the ways to do that is with things like greater taxation and and cut the cuts to subsidies is that really part of the solution do you think I tell you what is part of the solution because clearly the model is going to change price of oil is definitely going down and the substitution products are coming to the market the mindset has changed and as a result of that you cannot operate the country as this sort of welfare state where part of the social contract was we have wealth we are distri distributing part of it so for us it means a much more diversified economy to begin with number two an economy where the private sector is welcomed and where the business environment is friendly so that people don't bump into bureaucratic processes multiple licenses and are prevented from investing for all sorts of reasons so it's welcoming other investments and a slightly different model it also means providing value for money and focusing on the young people you know when you have societies that still have or that now have over ten percent unemployment twenty-five percent of the young people unemployed and a quality of service that people are not satisfied with there is something that is not really working and that needs to be addressed so it certainly requires creation of jobs by alternative channels including the private sector and it probably means scrutinizing the public service which represents a massive share of the public spending to make sure that there is quality of service and then that the wage bill is actually focused on those who provide the services Madame Lagarde thanks very much for being with us thank you all right still to come on counting the cost reconstructing Iraq prime minister haider al-abadi says his country needs to rebuild after years of conflict but how much will it all cost we'll break down the numbers for you but first when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union its closest neighbor the Republic of Ireland is going to take an economic hit a new report out this week says Ireland's unique exposure to Briggs it means it faces potentially a huge threat to jobs that could cost the country billions each year the UK is the second largest destination for Irish Goods after the u.s. the Dublin London air route is Europe's most traveled and apart from trade there's another major brexit related issue Ireland is the only country to share a land border with Britain it's preparing for the worst and looking for new markets I caught up with Kieran cannon Irish Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade while he was here in Doha I began by asking him if there is a lack of understanding internationally about the impact of break sit on the island of Ireland I thinks perhaps there was a number of months ago certainly in the immediate aftermath of the referendum when the decision was taken from Britain to leave the EU I think there was a lack of understanding but but as we now move forward into a critical phase of the negotiations I think there is more than a good degree of understanding of the challenges that Ireland is going to face indeed the challenges that Britain will face and the EU as a whole will face so I do think that as people read more about to become better informed I think there is a significant understanding developing internationally of the challenges that we face and at this point despite months of negotiations there still doesn't seem to be any real clarity on what exactly the UK wants from from breaks it what kind of breaks it is going to be how is Ireland then preparing for for exit well Ireland was in preparation for a number of I would say at least two years before the referendum actually occurred we were preparing in the hope that the decision to leave the you wouldn't be taken but on the very morning that it was taken a significant number of key strategic actions were kicked into place immediately while there may be no perfect clarity from the UK government as to how they want to move forward in the approach we have been nothing but clear as a country from the very very beginning we regret deeply regrets the decision taken by Britain to leave the EU I think ultimately proved to be a retrograde step for them but we on the basis that the decision has now been taken we have to act and work in Ireland's interests and I when I say Ireland's interests I mean the whole island of Ireland including Northern Ireland because it is critically important that the hard-won peace that exists now in our country that took years of diplomacy and effort and all our parts is a very can be at times a fragile one so that needs to be protected in the context of brexit and all the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement which brought about that peace need to be honored also the fact that we have now a seamless transition of people and goods back and over across that border between Ireland and Northern Ireland that needs to be protected but all of those things have been given a strong concrete commitment by the EU bar by our partner countries in the EU and indeed by Britain that those things will be protected in phase two the negotiations and this this is part of the problem isn't it why you say that there is clarity on the part of Ireland it's not clear what the UK government wants to see out of that I mean the state of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is does seem to be directly challenged by breaks it so this open border that you told me about that was negotiated 20 years ago in the Good Friday Agreement that this is at the heart of the whole thing isn't it just just explain to us for our viewers who might not be familiar this why this matters so much to people not just in in the Republic of Ireland but in Northern Ireland well we are a tiny island on the edge of Europe and post brexit we would we will form have the only land border between the EU and the UK we'll be on the island of Ireland and that is a significant part of the consideration and how exactly Britain structures and indeed the EU structures Britain's exit from the EU it's critically important for us as an island a small island nation where we agriculture for example is a huge part of our economy we have farmers producing milk in Northern Ireland in the morning that is processed in the afternoon in the republic of ireland we have that free movement of people and goods back and over across our border which has led to significant economic growth in both those jurisdictions which has led to peace in both of those jurisdictions and that is what we're trying to protect here so I think people need to be aware internationally of how important it is to Orange that that border remains open free and seamless but Ireland also wants to ensure that there are as few barriers to trade between itself and the UK is yes it's possible so if there is no deal worked out if there is a what some in the UK calling a harbor exit No Deal what what impact is that gonna have one on Ireland and its its key industries and jobs are you talking about earlier we have been working very hard over the last number of years long before it breaks it to diversify our export opportunities internationally for example our trade in China has doubled over the last number of years from the 7 billion per annum to 14 billion per annum 17% of our trade national trade is with Britain it's a huge part of our economy particularly around the whole food and agricultural sector so we want to protect that as best we can but ultimately if Britain takes a decision to leave fully leave the customs union and all of the the trading arrangements that allow goods and services to flow freely between Britain and Ireland that is going to pose a challenge not alone for Britain but indeed for the whole of the EU but it breaks it all bad for Ireland necessarily I mean how do you see the country well adapting to it thankfully it's not and we see significant opportunities arising for Ireland as a result of breakage and post Briggs's we would be the only english-speaking common-law country in the whole of the EU and when countries worldwide from all across Asia the Middle East and the u.s. want to establish a presence for the very first time in the EU in an english-speaking country where it's very very straightforward and very easy to do business we're hoping they will choose Ireland as that platform to launch themselves into a market of 500 million people a market that we are fully committed to and a market where we've already established very very strong trading relationships so we do see that as an opportunity for Ireland we also see the opportunity where some of the financial services sector particularly in the city of London where they choose to relocate internationally we are competing with locations like Frankfurt Paris and Brussels that Ireland will become a very attractive location for them to relocate to and to investing so it's not all bad in fact you know that opportunity to pitch ourselves as that launch pad for the english-speaking world into the EU would be very positive development in the future Kirin cannon good to talk to you thanks very much thank you very much indeed now International summit for Iraq's reconstruction was held this week thirty billion dollars was pledged to rebuild the country after the defeat of ISIL but the Iraqi government has estimated that reconstruction will cost a lot more than that what add that Hameed breaks down the numbers for us for 15 years conflict has laid waste to Iraq roads schools hospitals industry even entire cities are now in ruin millions of people live in poverty the government of Iraq worked with the World Bank to assess all this damage and count the cost of rebuilding the country they concentrated on the areas that were most affected in recent years of conflict they came up with a staggering figure a hundred and four billion dollars in total losses since the us-led invasion in 2003 damage from the war against ISIL alone is estimated at forty five billion now the breakdown seventeen point four billion is needed to rebuild homes this is a priority as about three million Iraqis are living in tents about ten billion dollars are required to repair schools and health care facilities at least half of Iraq's hospitals and health clinics are gone and then there's the water and sanitation system about 90% of it is damaged beyond use that's another 2.4 billion dollars repairing the damage ISIL cause to the country's cultural and religious sites will cost 1.7 billion another nine billion is needed to restore power for all Iraqis at the moment there are entire cities which don't have electricity at all and in others just a few hours a day the basic sectors of the country's economy need more than twenty billion dollars just to function properly nearly half of that is earmarked for the oil and gas industry that's a priority for Iraq to be able to pop more barrels per day and kick-start the economy but before reconstruction can begin the government of Iraq needs to provide security and stability as well as an all-inclusive government for all Iraqis regardless of sect or ethnicity for Iraq that is priceless millions of Chinese people around the world are celebrating the Lunar New Year and millions in China are traveling home for the holiday Adrian Brown reports now from Beijing well I'm on the concourse of Beijing railway station one of the busiest train stations in China and of course especially busy at this time of year and evidence around me of a nation now in motion much of the world's second largest economy will be at a standstill for the next two weeks as Chinese people take part in their most important celebrations of the year Chinese New Year really is the most important holiday of all now most people in China travel home by train at this time of year last year some 400 million people took the train more than half of them took the high-speed bullet train which is amazing because this time a decade ago the bullet train network was barely in existence here in China but it's now transforming lives in so many ways as they travel across this vast country at this time of year some of the people we've been talking to at the station are migrant workers and they say they're not going to be returning to Beijing because they no longer feel welcome and the reason for that is the government has been demolishing their homes in a campaign to get rid of what it says are properties which violate safety standards it also believes these homes are eyesore so that lends a sort of poignant aspect to this Lunar New Year holiday this of course is traditionally a time of year when big predictions are made we've been talking to a leading fortune-teller who says that actually the year of the dog is a very bad year for anyone born in it people like President Donald Trump he says the president's going to have a very bad year when it comes to his health and also to decision-making it's probably fair to assume though the President Trump doesn't pay a great deed of heed to Chinese fortune tellers but here in this part of the world they take those predictions very seriously Adrian Brown counting the cost in Beijing and that is our show for this week get in touch with us by tweeting me at handsome seeker and do use the hashtag a JCTC when you do or drop us an email counting the cost at al jazeera dotnet is our address there's more for you online at Al Jazeera comm slash CTC that will take you straight to our page which has individual reports links and entire episodes for you to catch up on that's it for
