KEVIN, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN THERE. NEIL, VERY INTERESTING. I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW COMING INTO THE SUMMIT, SOME NEWSPAPERS, INCLUDING THE "TIMES," DESCRIBED THE PRESIDENT AS A BIT OF A BLACK SHEEP OF THE FAMILY BECAUSE OF HIS SORT OF CANTANKEROUS NATURE BEFORE COMING HERE. AND SO A LOT OF US ARE WONDERING WHAT MIGHT THAT FAMILY PHOTO LOOK LIKE? WELL, LET ME SHOW YOU. OKAY, I WILL JUST SAY IT THIS WAY. IT LOOKED FINE ON THE SURFACE, NEIL. A LOT OF SMILES THAT YOU WOULD WELL-IMAGINE YOU WOULD SEE IN THAT SORT OF A PHOTO. IT STILL MAKES YOU WONDER BENEATH THE SURFACE, WAS THERE TENSION THERE? OBVIOUSLY NOT A LOT TO DRAW FROM THE PICTURE ITSELF. DID I NOTICE THAT CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU APPEARED TO LEAVE A LITTLE QUICKLY WHY WHILE THE PRESIDENT AND ANGELA MERKEL PULLED UP THE REAR. THE PRESIDENT DID SPEAK OF MACRON MEET WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT BRIEFLY. HE HAS BEEN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT BUSH TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD ON TRADE. NOW BEFORE LEAVING WASHINGTON FOR QUEBEC, THE PRESIDENT MADE THIS VERY CLEAR. HE HAS ONE WORD IN MIND WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE AND THAT'S RECIPROCITY. IF WE'RE UNABLE TO MAKE A DEAL, WE WILL TERMINATE NAFTA, WE HAVE A BETTER DEAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A DEAL, WE WILL BE BETTER OFF. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LIVE WITH THE DEALS THE WAY THEY ARE. EUROPEAN UNION TREATS US VERY UNFAIRLY. CANADA VERY UNFAIRLY. MEXICO VERY UNFAIRLY. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I THINK WE WILL PROBABLY VERY EASILY MAKE A DEAL. VERY EASILY MAKE A DEAL. WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE DEAL MIGHT LOOK LIKE. BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE, NEIL, OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT CALLS UNFAIR TRADE, LOOK AT WHAT HE TWEETED. CANADA CHARGES THE U.S. A 270% TARIFF ON DAIRY PRODUCTS. THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT, DID THEY? NOT FAIR TO OUR FARMERS. THE COMING UP WITH TRUDY LATER ON. GIVE YOU A READOUT AS SOON AS WE GET IT. IN THE MEANTIME THE PRESIDENT IS HERE AND IS EXPECTED TO LEAVE A LITTLE BIT SOONER THAN ORIGINALLY
