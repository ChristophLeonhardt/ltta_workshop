eaters Donald Trump doing what he does best save saying the obvious truth so bluntly so plainly that you can't dispute it you can haggle you can quibble you can say you're outraged by how rudy is but please watch the next 60 seconds and tell me a single factual error here and many countries are not paying what they should and frankly many countries o us a tremendous amount of money folks many years back where they're delinquent because the United States has had to pay for them so if you go back 10 or 20 years you just add it all up its massive amounts of money is owed the United States has paid and stepped up like nobody this has got enough for decades by the way this has gone on for many presidents but no other president brought it up like I bring it up so something has to be done and the Secretary General has been working on a very hard this year since our last meeting commitments that we made for over 40 billion dollars more money spent by other countries so that's a step but it's a very small step it sounds like a lot of money and it is when it's a very small amount of money relative what to what they owe and to what they should be paying yeah it's true and although Germany is where some of the US military bases are and the whole point of the whole point of NATO according to its first secretary-general Lord Ismay was to keep the Soviet Union out the Americans in and the Germans down that's right and Donald Trump is in and American taxpayers are in but where's everyone else we Canadians free right off the US military we all know it we boast about our free health care or actually we don't really boast about it a lot anymore because by now we all know about the massive waiting lines and sullen government workers and old obsolete technology but we wouldn't have free health care at all without the Americans paying for our security for the past 50 years and all of our moral primping and preening is because America foots our bill I'm sorry it's true you can like that you can dislike it but you cannot deny it and we're lucky that Trump doesn't focus on care unless we keep provoking him which Trudeau bizarrely seems to want to do but here's Trump talking with the NATO secretary-general a Norwegian chap named yen's Stoltenberg and what's his job was to make NATO strong so he didn't take Trump's message as a scolding I think he loved it I think he was grateful for it here take a look and it's an unfair burden on the United States so we're here to talk about that and I'm sure it will be resolved I have a great confidence in the secretary-general he's worked very very hard on this and he knows it's a fact but I have great confidence in him and his representatives first of all it's great to see you again mr. president and I get to have you here for a summit and we are going to discuss many point issues at the summit among them is defense spending and we all agree that we have to do more I agree with you that we have to make sure that powers are investing more the good news is that as how stop the terrorists or in defense of the years of Eggman's purchase order to have billions to the transporters and the law fails the biggest increase in defense spending across Europe and kappa in that generation why was that last year is also because of your foster care message and they won't write that but no I have said it before and the other thing is that it really has and it's your message is having an impact of course it's true do you doubt that Stoltenberg was grateful that the US president was speaking out that and sort of whispering as Obama and Bush and Clinton did before him and that point by Trump that the media wouldn't report that NATO was happy to hear it and Trump was having a positive effect Trump was 100% right wasn't he that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
