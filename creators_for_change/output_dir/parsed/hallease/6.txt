- Disclaimer if I'm burpy,
- All right.
it's because I'm drinking
soda, because I am sleepy.
- Okay.
All right guys,
oh we have an official
(slurping)
intro now.
Yeah, you're doing the most
with this ASMR. (laughing)
Okay, we have our official intro now,
so we gotta do it, so all right.
Hey everyone, I'm Hallease Beast,
I am a digital story
teller and video producer.
- Hi, and I'm Mr. Hallease Beast.
- Sure.
- Hi, and I'm Mr. Hallease.
I enjoy going to the beach,
and I am also an avid
college football fan.
- You're a nurse.
- I'm a nurse.
- All right, this is
the Beastcast Podcast,
your favorite aunt and uncle discussing
married life and things like such as.
(upbeat electronic music)
(whimsical piano music)
- On this week's episode.
- We are discussing this idea of
the pecking order.
In a previous Beastcast,
I had mentioned this
idea of a pecking order
in your relationship and
where your spouse should be
the number one, and then
everyone else should kind of
be after your spouse.
A few of y'all in the
comments asked for me to
dive, go deeper into that in a Beastcast,
so here we are, we're gonna talk about it.
The same idea if you're
coming at this Beastcast
from I guess the Christian perspective.
It's that idea of leaving and cleaving,
our friends Belief Mel and Mrs. Melanin,
they discuss this in a podcast episode,
How Married Are You?, their podcast.
I will link to it either
in the description box,
or in Anchor notes,
wherever you're listening/watching this,
it'll be there, and you can check it out,
'cause they have a very
interesting discussion on it.
- I'm gonna go ahead and take this time
to do a little intermissions.
Hallease mentioned
notes or comments that somebody made,
and how now it's a subject of the podcast.
If you too would like to
leave us a message or a topic
that you'd like for us to discuss,
go ahead and leave a voicemail on Anchor.
Anchor is the platform that
this podcast is living on,
go ahead and leave a
comment on the videos.
Hallease is reactive on the platform,
and so she either responds,
or she'll make a note of some
of the subjects that you make.
- I live for the comments y'all,
I read all the comments.
I really do.
- Comment, voicemail.
- It'll be in the notes.
- Anyway, back to the show.
- Yeah, so today we are talking
about the pecking order.
When I think I originally mentioned this
in the previous episode,
I was talking about it in regards to just,
just making sure your spouse know that
you see them as number one.
Then also in regards to how you interact,
mostly I believe, with family and friends,
but mostly family.
So that they begin to see you
and your spouse as a unit,
and don't try to wedge
themselves in between y'all.
That's making it seem like
everyone's out to get you,
and they're not.
- Right, they don't do
it in a malicious way.
- No, it's usually more just
at the end of the day, your
parents aren't in your marriage.
They're your parents,
so they're going to have a bias, right?
That bias is generally
gonna tend towards you
as their child, favorably.
Whether you are right or
wrong in the situation.
So you have to keep that in mind.
I know for me, this was actually something
that my father told me very early on
when we first got married.
'Cause when we first got married,
and we were moving into our
first apartment together,
my mother
wanted to help us
move into that apartment together.
Yeah.
- Right.
My dad came to me and pulled
me aside, and was like hey,
"Just so you know,
I'm gonna reign your mom in on this,
and she's not gonna help you
and your newly-married husband
move into your apartment together,
'cause I'm gonna put
my foot down on that."
- Also, partially because he didn't
want to help us move.
- Yeah, in general he just
doesn't like moving, in general.
But also, there was a lesson.
- Why would you?
There's a lesson to be taught here.
But he followed up to and was like,
"Your marriage is yours,
and so as your father and also
a person who's been married
for a couple decades now,
I'm gonna let you know.
Don't let anyone get in your marriage,
that is something you
need to keep in mind now,
that you are a married woman.
So enjoy moving into your new apartment."
I was like, oh wow.
Noted, and sure enough
that has come up even now,
especially with everything,
there have been times
where I've had to actually
pull my dad
aside and be like,
why are you in my marriage, sir?
With all due respect, you know?
- Right, so she has a
little bit more direct
communication
- I do.
with her parents,
on this topic as opposed to mine.
That's more of a gray area,
and I'd prefer not to discuss it,
even though I brought it up.
Well, I guess we are gonna discuss it huh?
- Then what's the episode about homey?
- I don't know.
I guess, I have a little
bit more difficulty
talking to my parents about it.
It's gotten a little bit better,
putting my foot down a little bit more.
I don't know,
just trying to blur the line
between being a good or bad son,
and also just cutting the umbilical cord,
because I don't answer to them anymore.
I answer to you.
- I think what I don't want people
to take away from this topic,
is that oh you gotta just,
just be cutthroat with everyone
that isn't your spouse now,
and that's not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is like,
I think it's more about boundaries,
like appropriate boundaries.
Especially, and then also not using,
and this is like a topic that maybe
you don't wanna talk about,
but not using your spouse as the scapegoat
for things that you don't
actually wanna do yourself.
(laughing)
Something that. (laughing)
A reason that Mr. Hallease
will give about things,
which sometimes it is
actually genuinely true,
and then sometimes it is kinda like,
you just didn't wanna do that,
and you're using me as the excuse.
But he'll say to people,
"Oh, well let me talk
to my wife about that.
Or let me talk to Hallease about that,"
if it's people we know.
When the reality is, is he
just doesn't want to do it,
and so he's holding off.
- Oh man, you're giving away my secret,
you're giving away
trade secrets right now.
- He's holding off, which is fine.
When it's an interaction
where you just don't,
like a used car salesman
or something like that,
well I'm gonna talk to my wife about it.
Yeah, play that card,
you know what I'm saying?
- I mean, for the most part it's true.
If I'm making a large purchase.
- Well yeah, of course, yeah.
- It's not just my
finances, it's our finances.
- Check out our last episode.
- Whoa.
- Great segue.
- Yeah.
But then sometimes it is,
like in regards to say,
maybe it's a family event
or something like that,
where you're like,
"Oh, let me talk to Hallease about it."
When the reality is that
you just didn't want to go,
and you're holding off telling
them that you don't wanna go.
But then the problem with that becomes.
- Oh, I see where you're
coming from with this.
- The problem with that becomes,
you keep doing that with family members,
then they start to resent me,
because they think I'm the catalyst
for why you're not doing
things with your family,
or why you're not answering,
or being the good son or whatever it is
they were used to you doing.
Not realizing that before,
you used to just grit your teeth,
roll your eyes, and bear it.
Whereas now, you're
actually just getting older,
and you just don't wanna
deal with it anymore,
but you don't wanna be upfront with that.
You don't wanna deal with
it, so you're using me.
- If you wanna get superficial
and biblical about it,
then honor thy father and mother.
You can still honor them,
you can still respect them,
and not wanna hang out
with them all the time.
(giggling)
Spend 18 years with them,
you should be out on your own,
you should be doing your own thing.
What's the cost-benefit
analysis, you know?
- You said cost-benefit analysis
for spending time with your family.
- It's a five hour drive to and from,
not doing a whole heck of a lot.
- Woo.
You need to see family.
You need to,
- Yes.
'cause how much time are you gonna have
with them realistically?
- That's true.
How much time are you
gonna have with anybody,
like time is finite, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.
All good points.
- Right, but so often times
I will make an excuse.
But sometimes, a lot of times,
it's oh hey are you guys coming down?
You can always come
down to do this or that.
It's like okay, sure.
Sometimes I don't know if
you're busy that weekend or not,
so I do need to consult with you.
- Yeah.
- But other times it's like,
well I'm not sure we're gonna go
because Hallease is out of town,
and then my parents got a
little bit wise to that,
and said oh, well feel
free to come down anyway.
- Now, they're starting
to pick through it,
they're starting to figure it out.
- Well if you're gonna
start removing the veil,
and lifting the veil, and
seeing the ugliness underneath,
then it's like okay, you know what,
I did not feel like
coming down this weekend.
So I will see you guys eventually.
- We interrupt this Beastcast
for a quick announcement.
(beeping)
(chuckles) I should
maybe put a little effect
like that in there.
- I kind of like the way that I did it.
- Okay, we'll just use
your voice or something.
- Okay.
- Thank you for

we're happy to have you.
- Now back to the program.
- Yes, back to the program.
- Podcast.
Beastcast.
- Bye.
Boop. (chuckling)
- I mean, you have to live your own life.
Again, a lot of this
it's interesting
- It's tough
how much of this comes out
of our current situation,
because we're living with your parents.
- We are living with them, we are.
So for those of y'all who
are new to us in general,
because you're new
Anchor/wherever you listen
to your podcast listeners.
- First off, thanks for stopping by.
- Thanks for stopping by, first of all.
You're gonna hear us
reference the house a lot,
or the housing situation a lot,
and what we're talking about.
- The storage unit.
- The storage unit, that's another.
- Sixth circle of hell,
it's probably like three,
it's level three.
- Anyway, you're gonna hear
us mentioning that a lot,
and what it is,
is at the end of 2017, we
purchased a home together.
Basically, we were first-time home buyers,
we just didn't,
a lot of things failed.
Point of the story, a
lot of things failed,
and we can't live in the house
because the home is unlivable.
The plumbing doesn't work,
and things like such as.
So we have been living with my parents
while we're working through
- Yay.
figuring that situation out.
- Co-dependents.
- Woo, so yeah.
- Displacement.
- Displacements, that's
how that's been going.
So when you hear us say,
well because of the housing thing,
that's what we're talking about.
Back to the podcast.
(laughing)
I definitely understand
how this is hard for a lot of people
when they get married, this whole idea of
the pecking order and
leaving and cleaving.
We're coming at it from
having to just learn how to
co-exist with parents, right?
A lot of people usually come out of it
too from prioritizing their
kids more than their spouse.
I'll see that happen a lot.
That's like woo, that's tough.
Children do need a lot
of attention, you know?
But I know when I was growing up,
my dad was very quick to acknowledge
that my mom was more
important to him than me.
(laughing)
Which I appreciated,
'cause it also let me know
that I couldn't.
Kids naturally,
'cause I see with Sederick
already too, my nephew.
Kids naturally
will wedge themselves
in between you as well.
Because my parents had a pecking order,
and I knew that I was not the top of it,
for either of them,
I couldn't try a lot of things.
Even in the way that they raised me,
I couldn't try a lot of things,
like nothing could really get by them.
Oh, I wanna go do something.
You know as a kid, you strategize right?
Which parent seems to
have had a better day?
Which one's in a good mood?
Which one maybe wouldn't mind
me not being here for a couple hours,
'cause low key, they just wanna chill,
and they don't wanna
see me really, you know?
So I would ask whichever parent I felt
felt that way, but it
usually never worked.
At the end of the day, I would ask them,
hey I wanna go to the movies or whatever.
Then, they would respond
what did your mom say,
or what did your dad say?
I'd be like (sighs).
Usually what would end up happening is,
my response would have to be
they told me to come ask you.
That was, now that I'm older,
I realize what that was.
That was their cue to
each other to be like,
I don't care, you decide.
They weren't ever really
individuals to me, as a child,
they were one unit.
This one hive-mind thing that
never let me do anything.
(laughing)
I'm just kidding.
- Okay, that's a lot of projection there.
- I'm just kidding.
- So really, it just comes down to,
again we use the hierarchy model
because it's very easy and it's like,
easy to envision.
So you just have to think about yourself,
so who in your life, who's number one?
It's gotta be you, no one's gonna look out
for number one except number one.
How are you affected by things?
Then just immediately below that,
if not right next to it or on the same,
on the same plane, right.
- You're here, the other
thing's like right there.
- Then it's your spouse,
'cause whatever affects you
is gonna affect your
spouse, and vice versa.
That's towards the top, if not the top.
So what comes below that,
is it gonna be children?
Maybe, is it gonna be family, or friends,
or whoever else it's gonna be.
That's the way it's gonna play out,
everyone else is gonna come below that.
- 'Cause you also have to remember too,
and I think this ties into that idea
of respecting your parents,
but you also have to remember
your parents aren't dealing
with you day to day,
hour to day, anymore, right?
They did their time, if you will,
and now your spouse is the one
that is showing up and
showing out for you every day.
The way you respect them,
the way you honor them,
is by making them the
priority in your life,
and letting your parents
fall to the appropriate level
of priority that they should.
Which is honoring the
commitment that they had to you,
right?
- Had.
Had to you,
by being involved in an appropriate level
and appropriate amount.
But also acknowledging
that they don't have,
they really don't have any
claim to you anymore, really.
- Right, I mean they still
care about your well being.
- Well yeah, they're always
going to, they're parents,
they're always gonna care about your,
well I guess we're also assuming that you
come from.
- Who's got more skin in the game now?
- Yeah.
- It's you and I.
- Right.
As opposed to onlookers,
which can advise, or
Monday morning quarterback.
- Right, there you go.
- But I'm the one, my blood is being shed,
so I don't know what game we're
playing where blood is shed.
- Right, totally.
'Cause I mean, the thing that
I remember growing up too,
my dad was always like if I
gotta come home and my wife,
and he would not say your mother,
he would always say my wife
is talking about stuff
that you did all day,
I'm gonna be upset because
you're messing with my wife.
She didn't become my mom anymore,
she was his wife in those moments,
and I was like, oh.
Okay, you know?
There's a difference in
language that happened,
where I was just like, oh.
I need to make sure that I'm
on my P's and Q's or whatever
with this woman. (laughing)
- It's very much like a
team sport or tribalism too,
within the family.
- Yeah, totally.
There's gonna be kids, and
then there's Mom and Dad.
Mom and Dad have to be a unified force.
Mom and Dad are like, the married couple,
has to be a unified force in the family.
They have to be a unified force
to any external force as well.
Be that
- Yeah.
other family members, used
car salesman, what have you.
- Yeah, totally.
I don't know, I think that's
just like the biggest thing,
is this idea of yeah,
leaving and cleaving,
as they say biblically, and doing that.
It's a lot easier said
than done, you know?
We still have issues with it.
You probably have issues with it.
I have issues with it sometimes,
but as a whole, I feel
like it was not very hard
for me to leave and cleave.
I did not have too much a struggle,
which is interesting,
'cause then it came from
a very well-rounded, loving,
tight knit family.
- I did too.
- Yeah, but I had no
problems being like deuces,
and starting my own life,
and maybe that's because I'm
the youngest, I don't know.
You're always kind of ready to be gone.
But I didn't really have a
lot of problems doing it.
Did you?
- I mean, in order for me to do it,
in order for me to
exert that independence,
I always used space.
- Yeah, you always used physical space.
- Physical space, because
I did that for college,
and I went a thousand miles away.
I did that after college,
then moved to San Antonio from Laredo.
- Yeah.
- There needs to be a barrier,
there just needs to be
something to separate.
- What would you do if
your parents lived here
in San Antonio?
- I just have to left them know like hey,
we're not available all the time.
If you wanna do some stuff, that's cool.
That's the thing, so
your parents understand,
it's like I'm doing my own thing.
- Yeah, my parents do their own thing.
- Yeah, your dad works on cars,
tinkers as he calls it,
and your mom is constantly busy.
- She's doing her own
thing 100% of the time.
(laughing)
- I can't even come up
with a good metaphor
for what she is.
She's a woman possessed.
- She's a living.
100%.
- Living her best life.
She's a shark.
- Yeah, she's a shark for sure.
- If she stops moving, she will die.
- Yeah, totally, totally.
- But with my parents,
it's very much like,
oh so what are we doing?
When are you coming to us?
They just wanna be active
and engaged with people,
and that's all well
and good, it's healthy.
- I guess the question is like,
so that way we feel like we're
helping people navigate this.
What tips, what actionable things
can we offer people about this,
so that they, you know, you what I mean?
Exercises.
- You just need to have
a crucial conversation,
it's painful with whoever
it is that feels like
they are owed some sort of your time,
or some portion of your time.
Just need to make it explicitly clear,
unless you have some sort
of housing situation.
It's like it's always gonna be
number one, number two,
number one, number two,
doesn't matter, it's always gonna be us.
Then it's gonna be everyone else.
If there's time,
if we don't need to
decompress or something,
then we can make time for people.
- I think it's also about
having the conversation
with your spouse too about who you as,
maybe you as the spouse,
who you feel like maybe
your spouse is putting ahead of you.
You're kinda like, in the most loving way,
I kinda feel sometimes that you
put this person ahead of me.
- We've had that conversation before.
- It makes me feel certain top.
- Yep, we had that conversation before.
- Maybe you gonna just let,
you know what I'm saying,
can we talk about that
for a minute or whatever?
- You may get a little butt hurt about it.
- Yeah.
- Which is
the route that I took.
(laughing)
- Yeah.
- But yeah, you just gotta have
to confront your own feelings about it.
It's like well, so then
again, was I doing that?
I was, okay, why was I doing that?
Because I didn't wanna have
that conversation with them.
Okay, well
who do you answer to?
Do you answer to them?
Do you answer to yourself?
Or to the unit.
- Right.
To the marriage.
- Right.
- It's also, I understand too,
the level of distance
between these people can be
almost incremental in how
much you ignore it, you know?
'Cause then it's also like,
well if they live far away,
say it's your parents for
example and they live far away,
and I only really have to deal with them
once every couple of
months, I'll just do it.
Then it's like sure, that happens,
but a lot of times I think,
especially what your spouse
notices, is on the back end,
after you deal with them,
how much you change, what
energy you bring back
into the relationship from it.
I know for me, that was
where I was coming from,
where it's just like,
yo we go down to Laredo,
and then we come back and you are not okay
for a week,
and I gotta deal with that. (laughing)
So let's handle it now.
- I just have a lot of things
that I just need to work through,
and I just keep siloing them away.
Oh Lord, 'cause one of that
is the finance thing right?
- Yes.
- Which is the previous
podcast where I felt like,
I just feel like I need to bring
something to the relationship.
If I don't feel like I'm contributing,
then I feel,
- Yeah.
a certain type of way,
and it's the same thing with my parents.
Or just like parents in general,
I don't want to assume
the role of teenager,
like the role of child.
Unfortunately every time I go home,
that is essentially what I feel like.
You have to allow your child
to make mistakes, you
also have to acknowledge
that your child,
- Isn't your child.
is your offspring but
they are not a child.
They have not been a child
for I don't know how many years.
Unfortunately, I cannot compartmentalize
those feelings when I go home.
The only way that I feel like
I can truly be independent,
is by putting this physical space.
- Right, so you just leave.
Whereas for me, and I think a lot of it is
because my parents,
yeah again, having that
certain level of just,
just so you know, we are
ready for you to be gone
when you're ready to be gone.
Not in a bad way, just setting,
they definitely always set the standard of
the goal for us is for
you to be self sufficient
and leave us.
Then we know we have done our
job well when you leave us,
and we will miss you, but bye.
Now that we're back
because of our situation,
they still very much have
that kind of mentality
of just like, you're grown,
I haven't had to think
about you financially
in a long time, and I don't
wanna go back to that.
Chill here, 'cause
we're happy to have you,
we enjoy your company,
when you're ready to go again, bye.
(laughing)
- So let's summarize this by saying that
we clearly do not have the answers, again.
- We don't.
- Because I have not deal
with these inner demons,
and I still struggle with them.
I am in no position to advise you,
the listener/viewer.
- Well, even if it's not
even that you can't advise,
but you can say you're not alone
in the struggle that you're having.
- Yeah.
- That's very true.
You're not alone.
- Traditionally, parents
are difficult to deal with,
whether they are a force of good,
or they are a determent.
- Yeah.
But they are their own people.
- Always.
Hopefully, they love and appreciate you
and you do the same.
- Yes.
But people make mistakes,
people aren't perfect.
- It's okay to love someone from afar.
All that to say,
hopefully we've at least given
you some tantalizing thought
for how you approach leaving and cleaving
in your own relationship,
and or creating a pecking order
in your own relationships.
Hopefully we've given you
something to think about.
- I hope so.
- Right, 'cause I mean
that's all we can really do,
to be quite honest.
'Cause we don't know anything,
we're not psychologists.
We're just a married couple
that is dealing with it.
- Let me just say that
these podcasts are hard.
- They're very hard.
People were hitting us
with serious topics.
- I'm just thinking about
trying to stay on message,
and try to make salient points.
- You see how always talk about
when you're listening to podcasts,
and you're like man, people
ramble and go off stuff.
It's like yeah,
that's how conversations are, you ramble.
So hopefully somewhere in this discussion,
you found something that was useful,
even if it was just realizing that hey,
your favorite aunt and uncle
are going through it too.
Figuring it out.
- Wow, they're a big mess.
Just like me.
Or not like me, wow I'm
doing a lot better than them.
Maybe that's okay.
- Maybe that makes us
more relatable to you.
Maybe it turns you off, Lord knows.
- Who knows.
But at the end of the day,
we'll see you next week.
- Yes.
- Thanks for listening/watching
the Beast Podcast.
