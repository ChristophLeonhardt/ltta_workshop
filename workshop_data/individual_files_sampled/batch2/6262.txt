does brainwashing work the right-wing attacks so many of the different things that bring you facts the media scientists professors in their ivory towers journalists and now science itself and the list goes on well in the case of global warming Donald Trump's been doing this a long time even before he ran for president back in 2014 he tweeted out this very expensive global warming I don't know why that's in all caps anyway this very expensive global warming BS has got to stop our planet is freezing record low temps and our GW scientists are stuck in ice that was a new story back then was a true that we had low record record low temperatures across the world no not remotely true if you look at the temperatures that is not in dispute there is an actual temperature reading that we all take and and I believe the last the hottest 10 years have been in the last 11 years and I've shown you these charts over and over again the temperature continues to rise across the world so it is just demonstrably false but that's never stopped Donald Trump before in fact back in 2012 this is where he invented the idea that it was a Chinese hoax he said the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make us manufacturing non-competitive so that is of course a lunatic conspiracy theory but now the guy is president so he keeps repeating it over and over and over again and is it going to work that's what the thrust of this story well I'll get that you the numbers in a second but now that he is president he's actually putting all this into effect as well Trump's administration has replaced or changed references to climate change or renewable energy on websites across the federal government studies showed the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA recently omitted any reference to climate change sea levels rising and global warming or mitts for years strategic plan so now that is political correctness on global warming you're not allowed to say what is scientifically correct you must say what is politically correct which is what Donald Trump beliefs which is that global warming is not true now do they actually believe that Donald Trump well nobody knows what Donald Trump actually believes including Donald Trump but the Republican Party largely of course does not believe that the officials but they are paid through campaign contributions and eventually lobbyist jobs when there's when they're out of office by the fossil fuel industry to put out this propaganda that they know is lies because unlike Donald Trump most of the other Republican officials are not that dumb and they can they see their campaign check coming in from ExxonMobil and and the giant lobbying groups for oil and gas and then they do as they are told and they tell you oh well temperatures might be rising some women deny that but it's not man-made now forget Exxon told me it's not mammy now in reality is I've shown you in previous episodes Exxon Mobil back when it was just the Exxon knew that climate change was real it was gonna happen and they've known it for decades and decades and they covered it up so nonetheless we have a political battle and debate in this country over things that are not debatable they're facts so let's look to see if it has gotten worse in the era of Trump well Newsweek reporting here just thirty five percent of Republicans believe global warming was caused by humans compared with forty percent at about this time in 2017 when Trump had barely taken office so like the ice caps support for the idea that global warming is real is melting at least among the Republican voters so in just one year he knocked it down from 40 percent to thirty five percent so people who previously thought that global warming was real heard Donald Trump say it isn't real and I quote I guess it must not be real then I guess Donald Trump is smarter and a more stable genius than all the world's scientists well I am sad to report to you guys that propaganda does work so now on the other end of the spectrum among Democrats a full eighty nine percent of Democrats meanwhile I believed humans caused global warming you can say well look then you could say the democrats are brainwashed because the republicans believe one thing in the democrats believe another but the democrats are first of all saying things that scientists are saying it's like saying well you've been brainwashed to think that to plus do it goes for well there's a pretty good reason for that because it actually does equal for so you say tomato i say science by the way that eating that percent number is not comforting the reality is as i'll show you on average 97% of the world's scientists say that not only is global warming real but it is man-made so actually the numbers should be higher for democrats it's too low for democrats let alone republicans all right now let's give you more context and more contrast between republicans and democrats thirty three percent of Republicans said they worried a great deal or fair amount about global warming and gallops twenty eighteen environmental survey that's the survey that i've been quoting throughout down three percentage points from the year prior ninety-one percent of democrats were worried a great deal or fair amount so it's just different way of phrasing it and I was actually heartened to find out that one-third of Republicans have not lost their mind yet that's a little bit of a surprise to me one more piece of context on that sixty nine percent of Republicans thought the seriousness of global warming had been generally exaggerated an uptick of three percentage points from the year prior only four percent of Democrats said global warming had been exaggerated that's an amazing number I'll get come back to that sixty nine percent in a second some Republicans also doubted most scientists believe global warming is happening just forty two percent said most scientists believe global warming is occurring down from fifty three percent last year so let's think about those two amazing numbers last year fifty three percent of Republicans think that at least scientists say the global warming is happening now eleven percent of those folks actually a higher percentage if you do the math but forty two percent now go yeah I still believe that the scientists think that although some of them don't believe the scientists but that chunk in middle there was like I no longer think that the scientists are even saying it why based on what has there been a new study out that show you that scientists don't actually believe that no Donald trust Trump just kept saying it over and over again so whatever Trump says I believe Dear Leader says there's no global warming that I don't believe it and I believe all the scientists change their minds look I think that most of them have not spent a lot of time thinking about this issue certainly they've not to spend a lot of time researching it I hesitate to call people dumb I think that's overuse I think that they're generally ignorant and unfortunately when you're in certain tribes and that ignorance has set in it is incredibly easy to manipulate you look at that numbers 69 percent of Republicans thought the seriousness of global warming had been exaggerated 7 out of 10 Republicans looked at all the world's scientists and said scientists what would they know so let me show you what the scientist actually believe this is from the publication skeptical science they actually are quoting 7 different studies that studied all the other climate change studies so these are meta studies and their conclusion of all of the research on this topic depending on exactly how you mean measure the expert consensus it's somewhere between 90 and 100 percent that agree humans are responsible for climate change with most of our studies finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists and number two conclusion is the greater the climate expertise among those surveyed the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming so that's where you get the 97% number from and depending on how you interpret it it could be all the way up to a hundred percent but let's just stick with 97% so finally think about this 7 out of 10 Republicans believe that 97% of the world's scientists are making it up scientists from Pakistan and Botswana and the United States and Venezuela and Finland and Japan all across the world all those scientists got together and decided man we're gonna prank the hell out of the whole world we'll make up temperatures we'll say all this the scientific method that we were talking just kidding man let's do one giant hoax let's pretend that the temperatures are rising and then it'll have these effects and then people will actually see those things with their own eyes massive storms massive fires the tryouts etc man will fuck the hell out if they thought about it for a second I think that'll I'm hoping that a lot of them would realize how monumentally preposterous that is but they don't think about it for a second whatever dear leader tells them is what they think by the way all of this comes back to money in politics because if the Republicans had not been bribed all along through campaign contributions by the fossil fuel industry we did not allow that there is no reason why they would have done the propaganda in the first place because they're on the same planet as us and the planet is melting and it is endangering all of us and our families from here on out but as long as they keep getting those campaign contributions and those legalized bribes they're gonna keep lying to you and guys like Donald Trump are the masters at lying and at the end of the day that is convinced about 35% of the country and overwhelming majority of the Republican Party that science is not real you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd
