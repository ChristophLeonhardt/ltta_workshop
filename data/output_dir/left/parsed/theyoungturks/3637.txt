ROY MOORE IS THE WORST.
I WILL
SAY THAT, OF COURSE HE
AFFILIATES HIMSELF WITH OTHER
HELD DEMONS SWAMP ORCS, AND WE
WILL POINT OUT JUST ONE OF THEM.
TALKING POINTS MEMO REPORTS ON
ONE DONOR WHO IS PARTICULARLY
TERRIBLE WHO WAS MAKING NEWS,
MICHAEL PEROUTKA, THERE HE IS ON
THE RIGHT, ROY MOORE IS ON THE
LEFT.
ACCORDING TO TALKING
POINTS MEMO --
>>WHO IS MICHAEL ANTHONY
PEROUTKA?
WELL --
>>THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW
CENTER SAY THAT GROUP IS A HATE
GROUP, PEROUTKA JOKES ABOUT
THAT, HE'S NO LONGER WITH THE
GROUP, BUT SINCE HE LEFT THEY
ORGANIZED THE CHARLOTTESVILLE
PROTEST, THEIR LEADER ONCE TO
ORGANIZE A SOUTHERN MILITIA FOR
GUERRILLA WAR, HE WANTS TO
ATTACK THE ORGANIZED JEWRY,
WHICH I'M A PART OF, WE ARE VERY
ORGANIZED.
IS IT ANY SURPRISE
THAT ROY MOORE AFFILIATES
HIMSELF WITH THESE FOLKS?
>>ALABAMA.
>>I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD, I
DON'T THINK HE KNEW THAT THEY
WERE -- I THINK HE THOUGHT THEY
JUST REALLY CARED ABOUT THEIR
HERITAGE.
I DON'T SEE A RACIST
BONE IN HIS WHITE BODY.
DO YOU?
>>NOT AT ALL.
WHAT ELSE, WE HAVE
SOME GREATEST HITS, YOU WANT TO
SEE PEROUTKA IN ACTION?
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO SING THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.
>>WAS HE IN THE UNITED STATES?
>>OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, WE WILL PLAY A VIDEO OF
WHAT HAPPENED.
>>♪ I WISH I WAS IN THE LAND OF
COTTON, OLD TIMES THERE ARE NOT
♪ FORGOTTEN, LOOK AWAY, LOOK
AWAY, LOOK AWAY, DIXIELAND
>>THERE YOU GO.
I CAN'T LOOK
AWAY.
I KIND OF HAD TO BECAUSE
THERE WAS A MAN WHO STOOD UP --
>>WE WERE LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S
BACK.
>>I DON'T -- WELL, I DO GET IT,
IT'S CALLED COGNITIVE
DISSONANCE, YOU LEARN HOW TO
PRACTICE THAT IF YOU GROW UP
RELIGIOUSLY GUIDED.
THEY ARE
UPSET AT COLIN KAEPERNICK FOR
DOING A SILENT, RESPECTFUL
PROTEST, THEY SAY IT DISRESPECTS
THE FLAG AND THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM, THIS GUY IS SINGING A
TRAITOR'S SONG, THEY HAVE A
CONFEDERATE FLAG THEY WAVE ALL
THE TIME, THIS IS COGNITIVE
DISSONANCE.
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL TO
SHOW YOU WHO THESE PEOPLE REALLY
ARE.
THEY ARE TRAITORS TO
AMERICA.
WHITE SUPREMACISTS ARE
TRAITORS TO AMERICA, JUST LIKE
THAT GUY IS, THAT'S ALL THIS IS
ABOUT, PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAITORS
TO AMERICA AND THERE'S NO DOUBT.
YOU SAY STAND FOR THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM AND SING A SONG OF A
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO
OVERTHROW OUR GOVERNMENT, WHAT
DO YOU CALL THAT?
THAT'S LIKE
ISIS.
>>THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I WENT
WITH IT BECAUSE THIS ARTICLE
KEPT COMING BACK TO RELIGION AND
HOW THEY WANT TO CHANGE OUR
GOVERNMENT TO BE MORE RELIGIOUS,
YOU PUT THE QUOTE UP THERE WHERE
THEY CALLED FOR A SOUTHERN
NATION RUN BY THE ANGLO CELTIC
ELITE, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
ISIS IS TRYING TO DO, THEY ARE
TRYING TO CREATE THEIR OWN
GOVERNMENT THAT IS RELIGIOUS
BASED -- THAT IS WHAT RATE MOORE
IS TRYING TO DO WITH HIS
500,000 BUCKS FROM HIS REALLY
CRAZY FRIEND.
>>YOU GOTTEN $622,000 SINCE
2004, 45,000 FOR HIS TWO
GUBERNATORIAL RUNS, MONEY FOR
MOORE'S SUPREME COURT COME BACK.
THIS IS ONE THING THIS GUY SAID
--
>>AND TO JEN'S POINT, HE SAID
--
>>IF A MUSLIM PERSON SAID THAT
HE WOULD CALL FOR HIM TO BE HUNG
UP --
>>MY FAVORITE THING -- ROY
MOORE WAS KICKED OUT OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA BECAUSE
HE ERECTED A GIANT 10
COMMANDMENTS MONUMENT IN THE
COURTHOUSE, BUT BECAUSE A COURT
SAID YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT DOWN
BECAUSE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND
STATE, YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT
THERE, AND HE SAID NO.
SO HE GOT
KICKED OUT.
PEROUTKA BUILT A
REPLICA OF THE 10 COMMANDMENTS,
ACCORDING TO TALKING POINTS
MEMO, ON HIS LAND, RENAMED THE
FIELD WHERE HE PUT THAT ROY
MOORE FIELD, HE HAS MADE
ANTIABORTION, ANTI-GAY, AND
CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS --
DONATIONS TO THOSE -- AND THEN
PEROUTKA GAVE $1 MILLION TO A
FOSSILIZED SKELETON OF
A DINOSAUR.
IT LOOKS LIKE A GIANT CROCODILE
DINOSAUR.
>>SO THEY BELIEVE IN DINOSAURS?
I'VE BEEN TO THAT MUSEUM, BY THE
WAY, THEY FOLLOW YOU AROUND AND
MAKE SURE YOUR ART LAUGHING OR
POKING FUN IN FRONT OF OTHER
PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT
WE WERE THERE FOR.
WE SMELLED
LIKE WEED, THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE
DOING.
I WAS WORKING IN
CINCINNATI, IN JOHN BOEHNER'S
DISTRICT, TELLING JOKES, YOU CAN
DRIVE RIGHT OVER SO WE DID.
>>I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE
HIGH AT A DINOSAUR MUSEUM.
THAT'S THE MOST TERRIFYING
THING.
>>IT WAS SADDER THAN EXPECTED
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
WOULD BE OTHER PEOPLE WITH THEIR
CHILDREN, AND THEY ARE BRINGING
THEIR KIDS AND IT'S LIKE, I FEEL
LIKE THEY ARE DOING CHILD ABUSE
TO THEM, WHICH THEY ARE.
BECAUSE
THEY ARE MISINFORMING THEIR
KIDS, THEY ARE ANTI-SCIENCE-ING
THEIR KIDS, THEY ARE TEACHING
THEM TO DO COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.
THIS ISN'T SCIENCE, THIS IS
CRAZY PEOPLE LIKE ISIS AND AL
QAEDA, ONLY THEY ARE WHITE
AND LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY.
>>THIS IS A MUSEUM BUT THEY SAY
DINOSAURS WERE CREATED IN
OUR COUNTRY?
>>ADAM AND EVE LIVED WITH
DINOSAURS.
THE CREATION MUSEUM.
>>WOW.
SO ROY MOORE, HE WON THE
PRIMARY, AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER HE HAS
A CHANCE TO WIN IN ALABAMA, HE'S
A REPUBLICAN, BUT HE HAS RUN FOR
GOVERNOR BEFORE AND LOST, SOME
FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ROY
MOORE IS IN 2012 HE RAN FOR
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND HE
BARELY, BARELY WON AGAINST
SOMEONE WHO JUST WAS A LATE
ENTRANT, HE BARELY WON THAT RACE
IN A RACE WHERE OBAMA GOT BEAT
BY ROMNEY BY DOZENS OF POINTS.
SO ROY MOORE POLLS BEHIND THE
NATIONAL AVERAGE.
DOUG JONES IS
A PROSECUTOR, THEY ARE SPLIT, NO
ONE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.
>>I KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.
THE ALL-POWERFUL HAND OF
THE RUSSIANS WILL COME IN AND
THROW THIS ELECTION.
DID YOU
KNOW THAT THE RUSSIANS SPENT
ALMOST $100,000 ON FACEBOOK?
IT'S LIKE, WHAT ARE
YOU, DOCTOR EVIL?
THEY SPEND $2 BILLION --
$100,000, IT'S NOT 1976, THAT'S
NOT A LOT OF MONEY.
>>BEFORE WE WRAP UP WE WILL SHOW
SOME THINGS THAT ROY MOORE PUT
UP OR SHARED ON FACEBOOK.
ONE
WAS, WANT TO STOP RIOTS?
HE
SHOWS BLACK PEOPLE ON A CAR --
PLAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, THEY
WILL ALL SIT DOWN.
>>THEY DIDN'T SHOW THAT THE COP
JUST SHOT SIX UNARMED BLACK GUYS
BEFORE HE JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR.
>>HERE IS ANOTHER ONE, WOULD THE
OPPRESSED MILLIONAIRE
QUARTERBACK WHO WOULDN'T STAND
FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM POINT
OUT WHICH OF THESE GUYS WAS
BLACK SO WE CAN REMOVE THE
OFFENSIVE FLAG?
>>THAT IS 
USING DEAD SOLDIERS TO
COME I DON'T KNOW, FURTHER YOUR
RACISM.
BECAUSE APPARENTLY IF
YOU ARE BLACK AND POOR YOU
AREN'T ALLOWED TO PROTEST, AND
IF YOU ARE BLACK AND RICH YOU
AREN'T ALLOWED TO PROTEST.
IF
YOU ARE BLACK YOU AREN'T ALLOWED
TO PROTEST.
BUT HE CAN SING THE
LAND OF DIXIE, HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CONFEDERATE
FLAG OR SINGING THE PRETEND
NATIONAL ANTHEM OF THE GROUP OF
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OVERTHROW THE
COUNTRY, THE ACTUAL
SECESSIONISTS --
IN FACT THEY HAVE SECESSIONIST
PARTIES EVERY YEAR, DON'T THEY?
>>AND THEIR GOAL, VERY CLEARLY,
THEY WANT TO REMAKE OUR
GOVERNMENT AS A RELIGIOUS
GOVERNMENT, WHICH REALLY
CONCERNS ME BECAUSE THEY ARE
SAYING THE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE IS
BEYOND REPAIR, WHICH I THINK
WHERE I WATCH SO MUCH CONGRESS I
SEE IT PLAY OUT IN REAL TIME,
YOU HAVE THESE RELIGIOUS PEOPLE
AIMING TO DISMANTLE OUR
GOVERNMENT.
THAT IS THE FIRST
STEP TO GETTING THIS NEW
GOVERNMENT, THAT THEY CAN MAKE
IT BE AROUND JESUS OR WHATEVER
THEY ARE TRYING TO DO, THEY WANT
TO APPLY A BIBLICAL WORLDVIEW TO
CIVIL LAW AND GOVERNMENT.
IT
MAKES SENSE, WE WILL HAVE ONE
MORE OF THESE REALLY RELIGIOUS
PEOPLE IN OUR GOVERNMENT WITH
MORE THAN A TAD OF RACISM
ATTACHED TO HIM -- WHEN I LOOK
AT THE BIG PICTURE WE HAVE A
PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY OF
RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT, I THINK
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE RELIGION
PROBLEM IN OUR LEGISLATURE RIGHT
NOW. AND HE WOULD JUST BE
ANOTHER ONE THAT WOULD BE VOTING
BIBLICALLY INSTEAD OF WHAT IS
BETTER FOR SOCIETY.
