There's an old soul in these dogs,
and they appreciate you
in a way that a puppy can't.

Muttville is a senior dog rescue.
We save senior dogs and find
them fabulous new homes.
We get dogs in all sorts of conditions,
and because they're old
they even have more issues.
With the matching funds we
got from the Subaru grant,
we got to set up our
own veterinarian team,
because we don't want
to see any dog suffer
once it steps through our doors.
- I'm not sure that Ava
rescued me or I rescued her.
My oldest granddaughter is now 12,
and the younger one is nine.
I watched them initially twice a week
and I loved that.
As they were older and they
have their various activities
and friends, I don't babysit as much.
I miss them already.
It's very important for me to
have somebody to take care of.
It's just my nature.
I need to have that.
So, one night I was looking
through all the senior dogs
that were available, and I saw Ava
and I thought, oh my god, this is it.
When I had read her bio, it
said she had a heart murmur.
But when Sherry told me that
she required heart surgery,
I was pretty taken aback.
They just really weren't
sure that Ava would even
make it through the night.
- What Subaru did with CNN Heroes
really allowed us to change our game.
Because we had our own vet,
we could see what was going
on and save that dog's life.
- If I don't feel needed,
then I don't feel loved.
But, Ava needs me.
I need her.
So, therefore love exists.
