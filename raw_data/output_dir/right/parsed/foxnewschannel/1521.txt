BRIAN: CAPITAL POLICE OFFICER
SERENATING PARTNER WITH
PERFORMANCE OF LOVE BALLAD.
LAMONT JOHNSON AND MICHAEL
CAGEL, WELCOME, GUYS.
>> HOW IS IT GOING?
AINSLEY: WE ARE GREAT.
I HOPE YOU ARE.
HOW DID THIS THING GET OUT AND
WHY DID YOU DO IT?
>> WE JUST WANTED TO TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH SOCIAL
MEDIA TO TRY TO REACH OUT TO THE
COMMUNITY AND DO SOMETHING FUN
FOR PEOPLE.
BRIAN: HEY, MICHAEL, ARE YOU
IMPRESSIVE WITH LA MONTES --
LAMONT'S VOICE AS WE ARE?
>> OH, YEAH, I WANTED TO SHARE
IT WITH THE WORLD.
>> I STARTED DOING KARAOKE, IT
STARTED SNOWBALLING AFTER THAT.
AINSLEY: WE WERE WATCHING IT
YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY WE PLAYED
IT FOR AUDIENCE AND I THOUGHT IT
WAS GOING TO BE FUNNY, WOW, HE
CAN REALLY SING, YOU HAVE A
GREAT VOICE.
NOW, MICHAEL, DO YOU THINK TOO?
>> YEAH, BUT NOT -- I CALL HIM
THE VOCAL JUSTICE AND I'M THE
VOCAL OF PRIDE.
AINSLEY: WE WANTED YOU TO SING
ALONG WITH HIM.
I DIDN'T KNOW THE WORDS TO THAT
SONG.
BRIAN: IS THIS PART OF YOU
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GUYS ARE
HUMAN BEINGS TOO, NOT ONLY WHEN
YOU ARE WALKING AROUND BUT YOU
DO THE SAME THINGS THAT WE DO,
ONLY WE DON'T DO IT AS GOOD AS
YOU DO, LAMONT?
>> WELL, WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO
DO IS FRIEND THE COMMUNITY.
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A DIVIDE
FURTHER IN AMERICA AND BRINGS US
TO COMMUNITY AND CLOSER TOGETHER
IN THE END.
AINSLEY: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
HAVE MORE VIDEOS.
CAN Y'ALL SING SOMETHING THAT
YOU BOTH KNOW, GIVE US A TASTE
OF WHAT'S TO COME?
>> WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
>> WHAT'S ON?
I DON'T HAVE A SONG RIGHT NOW
THAT I CAN DO.
BRIAN: HOW ABOUT FEELINGS?
>> YOU KNOW THAT SONG?
>> NO, WE DON'T KNOW THAT SONG.
AINSLEY: LAMONT, DO YOU SING AT
CHURCH, YOU SAID KARAOKE?
>> I DON'T SING AT CHURCH AT
ALL.
I USED TO MIMIC PEOPLE LIKE
MICHAEL JACKSON, PRINCE, A
LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY.
I STARTED TO STAY GROUNDED AND,
YOU KNOW, ENJOYED SINGING AND
RELEASE STRESS AS WELL.
>> IF LAMONT IS SINGING AND YOU
HAVE A POLICE CALL OVER THE AIR,
DO YOU LET HIM FINISH THE VERSE,
YOU PUT THE SIREN AND GO?
>> WE PUT THE SIREN AND GO.
AINSLEY: YOU HAVE TO SING US ONE
SONG.
COME ON.
BRICK HOUSE, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
SONG.
AINSLEY: COME ON, SOMETHING.
AINSLEY: HOW ABOUT THE SONG YOU
SANG, REENACT WHAT WE SAW
YESTERDAY?
>> WE CAN DO THAT ONE.
