hello and welcome to Sophie & Co I'm Sophie Shevardnadze vladimir putin has won the russian vote is about to embark on a second consecutive term as russia's president what lies ahead for Russia and the world now I asked his official spokesperson dimitri p school thanks a lot for being on our program it's been a while actually yeah so I guess Putin has to win more often for us to talk to you but we got a lot to talk about let's start with elections that resign over President Putin got much more than anyone expected he got more than in 2012 it's a historical record in our country yeah but you know everyone thought he was gonna win even the people who didn't like him were like of course he's gonna win I mean there's like no doubt about it but the bets were like six days 65% but this did you expect this result yeah and himself he said actually that nade was quite unexpected for him it was quite unexpected and now well of course as a prisoner of a country when you have this level of support you feel the level of responsibility because every leader carries a burden of responsibility of the support I was in America recently in Europe what they're saying is that because there's so much pressure from the west towards Russia that kind of helped consolidate Russia's public opinion and helped Putin gain this much votes would you agree with that well partly is of course where we can hardly ignore this effect of international pressure pressure coming from outside because this is Russia its outstanding country with its own traditions historical traditions and and historical mood of people you know they face any pressure coming from outside they unite they unite and they unite around a strong leader this happened numerous times during our history and and of course partly it is happening now because when you're when you see unprecedented pressure when you see even craziness coming from some countries do you understand what I mean well people people cannot tolerate it they resist and resisting they unite around strong leader the Russian Constitution limits the president to two consecutive terms now when Putin was asked about what he's going to do he said I'm not going to change the Constitution yet yet being the key word well actually he never said that he never said that well of course you have to be very precise when you quote Putin what was his exact moment otherwise you will say that you're like myself no he said the question was have you ever thought and are you planning constitutional reform in this country constitutional yet and he said not yet but it's not about changing Constitution or its constitutional reform is more complicated thing but he said not yes and you have to be precise in encoding bit so he never did it before he never did it in the year of 2008 and he was enjoying again overwhelming support of the people of this country and presumably should he want that in the year of 2008 he could have easily done it to change the Constitution and to adjust the Constitution in accordance with his own political perspectives he never did that and we don't have any slightest reason not to believe him not to trust him not to think that he is not going to adjust Constitution in accordance with his personal political will the only thing that he is pursuing the only goal is a goal of ensuring a prosperity rising prosperity of the people of this country stability of this country and well economical breakthrough of this problem so just to precise when he man no constitutional reform yet he meant that maybe there will be constitutional reform but it wouldn't be tied to his personal staying or not staying in power is that what you're saying well of course okay of course all right I know that after elections you like it president this term is gonna be focusing on internal affairs you're gonna be focusing on everything that's going on in economy what would that mean for the foreign policy would that isolate Russia either further from the rest of the world no to the country to the country Russia and President Putin he's looking for repairing relationship where it is possible and looking for developing and furthering relationship with the various countries especially our partners in Europe with the United States and mmm proceeding in those in this development as far as our partners are ready to you well the foreign policy as far as I can interpret it in Putin's understanding the main purpose of foreign policy and international relations is to ensure a comfortable environment for implementing of domestic talks tasks so he is quite he is quite understandable in his domestic tasks he's got quite a clear plan of development in the understanding of preliminary tasks of secondary tasks and so on and so forth so what he needs he needs the support from diplomacy to ensure a comfortable environment we've got a lot of questions about whether there is a room for maneuvering between west and Russia and what series place for creative diplomacy but first I want to ask you about us and what we do and the consequences that what we do entails in the West for instance when the president was addressing the nation he unveiled new weapons to the world and said that no one has this kind of weapons deserve the best the fastest and he said now the world will listen do we need to show weapons in order for the world to listen to us I mean do not have other means to get our message across well he's been trying to to send his message across since the year of 2002 or 2003 I don't remember exactly right now but when United States abandoned the Treaty of anti missile defense no that was a very very serious threat for mutual nuclear deterrence and this is a basic basic element of international stability and security and since then Russia found itself as a state being under siege of attempts of neutralizing its nuclear potential nuclear capabilities thus endangering the existence of nuclear deterrence the only way and despite sending sending signals of an acceptance of this process proposing various compromises proposing cooperation in ensuring international stability unfortunately our country failed to meet reciprocity and as a result as a result the only way was to show that in any case in any case despite all the efforts of our counterpart and counterparts in this story despite their continuous efforts to build the entire entire missile shield Russia will be capable of assuring a mutual deterrence system do you feel like this is working showing that we have the best in the world yes definitely yes can you elaborate you know well if you analyze the reaction coming from responsible members of international society you will see that the reason a certain understanding understanding of necessity of urgent negotiations on international security and and well and even disarmament well Trump just complained recently after a phone call to Moscow that this arms race is getting out of hand out of whose hands well we know that we know that nuclear weapons Amane not to be used they are made to protect in the main purpose of existence of nuclear weapons is not to be used ever so they protect and they ensure stability and they sure this balance but we're not only two countries carrying nuclear weapons nuclear potential there are other countries countries that are about to become nuclear powers our countries who are endangering the world to become nuclear powers countries that might have been already might have become already nuclear powers we all know that and all these can lead to change a balance and that is extremely dangerous and that needs cooperation between leading nuclear powers to ensure a process of non-proliferation to cooperate and in well and in strategic stability but I think when he meant the arms race is getting out of hand he really just meant Russia and the United States and you know I was asked this question when I was in America and I thought it was kind of funny because there's such a discrepancy in Russia's military budget and America's military budget I mean there were like seven hundred billion dollar budget with like eighty billion just bonus this year and all of our budget is going to be reduced yes so how it's percentage of our injury seriously well of course we cannot compare our military spending so well in in in in five yeah in five years we're going to spend less than 3% of GDP for military for military defense purposes and for arms production purposes it cannot be compared to the spend atures of the United States but but I would like to remind you the latest statements of President Putin Russia is not going to be to be driven into a arms race it does not correspond with the president Putin's primarily goal of domestic economic development and domestic breakthrough in economy so he we all and President Putin we all do not need arms race and it was confirmed and declared by President Putin and this is the main declaration that we have to take into account all right mr. pesco we're gonna take a short break right now when we come back we're going to continue talking to the me trippy school Russian president's press secretary we're talking about everything the Russians between Russia the United States and Europe we're talking about the media wars and much more stay with us and we're back with Dmitry Peskov Russian president's press secretary Mississippi School when NBC's megyn kelly asked him about whether we're in a new Cold War or not President Putin dismissed it as propaganda he said know anyone who's saying that American Russia are at the new Cold War that's part of propaganda but when you really look at the facts right I mean there are troops on Russia's borders and they're getting closer and closer Russia is creating new weapons there's the huge media war going on between the countries accusations flying back and forth especially towards Russia with the poisoning and the meddling in the elections what is it then it's not a Cold War what is it that well what's happening between American we're announcing we're witnessing lots of elements of Cold War and unfortunately worse a more and more of elements of Cold War on our agenda and we're facing it in international relationship if we face mmm that's Kate well let me say it's not all the countries are comfortable with the rising Russia with the rising Russia Russia with a leadership of President Putin they should be used to it by now it's been 18 years now well the more Russia is rising the more uncomfortable they feel and the more tough they start to behave in international relations and in this tough behavior they are ready it to jeopardize international law the basics of international relations free trade free trade and commerce regime they are ready to - they are ready to forget about about fair fair trade they're they're ready to forget about WTO rules they are ready to forget about every rules when they want to suppress Russia right and this voice famous famous words of craziness we're going to to make them pay the pay the price you know it's like maniacs why Russia I mean there is China I mean it's rising much faster and much more its incomparable there's no comparison to Russia how fast China is rising I mean India much less but still there are so many other countries that are rising whether we talk about human rights what they accused us off I mean incomparable what happens in Russia in those countries right incomparable but it's the Russia that's demin eyes in terms of even rising they're rising much faster than Russia why is it that the Russia is always the infernal enemy well I don't think I can explain it in couple of words it's a very complicated complicated issue that needs a much more deeper analysis I think it comes from history if you see through history Russia was was treated as a as a rival with an enemy for lots of centuries and there are some selling some let's say some earrings from some remaining sin in attitude of Western countries towards Russia coming from from that time but it doesn't mean that all the countries in the West that they share this philosophy lots of countries in Europe they understand that Russia isn't a Keable part of Europe and you cannot think about prosperous Europe and developing Europe if you if you don't see Russia being involved in all the European processes that Russia's voice has to be taken into account and so on and so forth so it's mmm we we cannot say that this angry attitude is an overwhelming one it is very serious unfortunately but but there are some voices let's say sober voices coming from from various regions of the world I think I think this angry voice is overwhelming if we talk about United States I mean I have and I lived in a country for ten years I love the country but I have never ever encountered and seen anything like that this is an anti well you know the perfectness of the brainwashing system I want to talk to you about that because I feel like the main difference between cold war now even the Putin doesn't like this as a term to describe what's going on now and the cold war then the actual cold war is the media war because now we have the media on both sides and to be fair like I think we should take a you know fair share of the blame here because what you have is that everything is out in the open back then there are rules of the game you know like some boundaries that eat either side rarely crossed right now with the media putting it out everything there is what president think or say what journalists think or say what citizen every average citizen things or says that really makes it and takes that the animosity to a whole new level it takes in to the people's level which was never there before I mean Soviet Union in America there were ideological enemies but the people never hated each other they hated each other systems right Soviets long for all things Western and vice versa right now what we have is this hatred on people's level which and I think the media is to blame for that do you feel like this media war this unfiltered media war is really adding to this animosity between extremely well people the people are Nate against this media wars they are victims they fell victims of this media wars and then they cannot create their own point of view they cannot be an owner of their own attitude so so they are being hmm even not motivated but they're being driven into a certain wave of emotions without even understanding them and they not they simply cannot have any objective approach towards these or that event towards these or that country there's a huge machine walking actually what happened during let's say last three or four decades anglo-saxon media they started to rule the world economically commercial media and but also political media I mean media from the United States Great Britain they are most powerful they are most influential and they have the widest possible reach in the world globally and of course this feeling of monopoly so it brings it brings a will to manipulate this monopoly so you can you can use this monopoly as a tool of delivering your point of view whether it is right or wrong it doesn't matter you can adjust it in accordance with situation to simply to manipulate the brains of people throughout the world and this is why they strongly oppose appearance of any rivals even small rivals like RT in comparison it was a pretty well for the past eight years I sincerely believe that size doesn't matter here it can be small but you can do much much much let's say more influential things that is what you are doing and that is what makes them very nervous because just mirroring them it's holding to be a rival for them and this rivalry can ruin the system of brainwash this is the reality do you feel like this media war should you know be put down a notch a little bit maybe maybe maybe four course maybe someone should say from the top you guys take it easy it's getting I would like I would like to remind you that Russian side through diplomatic channels through various channels have proposed contacts with different partners in the world in Western Europe and the United States to cooperate in cyber terror against cyber terror corporate in joint combating informational fakes and so on and so forth no answer silence in answer so no one would would co-operate him that easier and and as a result as a result we see all of a sudden willingness of anglo-saxon media to enjoy the details of disaster the disaster happening in happening in Aleppo and paying no attention to disaster happening in Raqqa for example so when it comes to actions of coalition the coalition planes and coalition bombing hundreds tens of thousands of dead people and dead bodies lying there unburied they don't pay any attention you wouldn't find any trace of information on that yes in anglo-saxon media why because it's the purpose is different the purpose is not to be objective this is it whatever happened to the culture of this period because I named Ronald Reagan he hated Soviet Union he never made it a secret that he wanted to break it up but he went through the trouble to learn all the Soviet jokes so he controlled the Soviets accordingly now what you get like this rhetoric back and forth it's just so desolating I mean the latest coming from the British defense minister just go away and shut up what happened Britain is a different story you know it's still in general what happened to this culture of dispute it is getting lower and lower unfortunately what we see is a country of Byron and Shakespeare country of Conan Doyle a country that used to be a brilliant Empire but with the immense political traditions to additions of diplomacy and so on and so forth it turned into a country where where where politicians are making well let me humbly say irresponsible statements this is a problem it's it's reflection of a very hostile policy unpredictably hostile policy and and this is the reality that we have to face and this is the reality that we have to face we have to minimize the consequences of this unfortunate reality for our country and we have to ensure using all possible diplomatic and political methods we have to minimize the consequences for our own country and to ensure that conditions for our domestic purposes is suitable and comfortable mr. Pishko we're going to talk about that and much more in the second half of our program we'll talk about whether your special relations can get better and if putting his jokes and the things that he says are lost in translation when it comes to Western media well welcome to Sophie & Co I'm Sophie Shevardnadze we're talking today to Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov we're talking to him about what this presidency will mean for Russia and the world so I gotta ask you about the spy scandal in Great Britain there are three conspiracy theories the most popular ones first one being that put and ordered the killing of the spy to get some tough-guy points before the elections the second one is that it's the secret services who did it without putting knowing forget about the third one this two are the most popular one I don't even know which one is worse by the way what's this third one it's something in between Plan B yeah but those are the two most popular ones that he ordered to get some tough guy points before the election well the third one was he ordered it to actually provoke the West's reaction and he knew that the West's reaction would be very hostile towards Russia and they would further consolidate Russian voters around Putin and the third one which I think is the worst one is that Putin didn't know but his Secret Service's just went and went along and execute it well this is artificially constructed theories first we we we have to remember and the starting point is the words of President Putin that Russia has nothing to do with this accident this is number one number two we're not speaking about attempt to murder to murder a Russian spy in Great Britain we're speaking about attempt to murder a British spy in Great Britain he was a British spy and he is a British spy he's not a Russian spy who he saw as a Russian citizen well he is a Russian citizen but he's not the Russian spy he was handed in to Britain as a result of exchange so why should Russia hand in a man that is of any importance or that is of any value it's unimaginable so if if he's handed in so Russia quits with him he's of zero value of zero importance go ahead so this is number 1 number 2 words of President Putin so we're not as crazy as to as to even to think about something of that kind before presidential elections and before such important of a global event as football championship number three the first blaming x' came from politicians just couple of hours after the accident couple of hours after the accident we heard first blaming of russia that highly likely russia was responsible of that murder of attempted murder and now what we see we see words of experts and experts of organization for performing OPCW that say that the preliminary examining of this agent will take about three weeks as a contradictory yes it is then well in general why Russia why Russia why to blame Russia you know it's maybe it's a very rude comparison especially in this situation I don't think that anything can be big can be ruder than their reality but nonetheless just imagine Moscow city car accident there is a victim of the car accident and we see what was the car and the car was a British main car let's say Range Rover and just imagine that myself or Foreign Ministry spokeswoman makes a statement that the man was killed by a British make car in a car accident in centre Moscow and highly likely Prime Minister of Prime Minister of Great Britain may be responsible of that murder I mean it's it's much easier to to smuggle British made car into another country than a russian-made bomb 21 I mean oh but but why do you think that yeah it could have been a russian-made bone or Russian made agent you're saying we don't approve well Russia has completed destroying all chemical Arsenal arsenal of chemical weapons and it was confirmed by international observers what is your version what happened I don't think we want to have a version and well we want to have a version as a result of Russia's taking part in this investigation at least receiving some details in receiving some information you would probably notice that the briefing in the foreign ministry for for ambassadors of various countries we haven't seen Ambassador or Great Britain in there if Britain has questions in this case why shouldn't British ambassador come and listen the answers so as if they're asking questions not willing to get any answers as if the US asked questions having a judgment and priority to them so this is extremely unfair this is extremely contradictory with international law international principles of behavior and diplomacy so this is unwillingness to - to see the rule to see the reality to see the reality I mean the absence of chemical guns in Russia and it's not Russia's judgment it's a judgment of international organization relevant international organization so this is it I agree it's unfair the way you put it but what's Russia gonna do I mean we're just gonna you know step back and not say anything not explain anything that we're just gonna leave the ball of course no one should expect Russia to seat to seat and and then keep silence against such craziness against such an aggressiveness and the unpredictability of course Russia will will will pursue its goals Russia will defend its interests and Russia will will answer every step of entire Russian origin and Russia will will definitely continue to explain itself it is doing every day you see all the all the discussions of the explanations coming from Russia's responsible ministries what everything that can be said well as a theory is improper you know I'm not apologizing I'm a journalist too to throw any any theories any any any models of incident we have to be very responsible against this incident this is really very dangerous for all of us usage of an agent of nerve agent in Europe this is a danger for all of us this was attempt of killing of Russian citizen by the way I don't know if mr. scrap all still still has a Russian citizenship but his daughter definitely has so and and Russia is a country of course it's need needs to to receive information about state of health of its citizen that was assassinated on British soil this is completely you know this is completely unfair to to mention about any slightest possibility of Russia's being involved in there we're gonna take a short break right now when we come back we'll continue talking to Russian president's press secretary Divinity School stay tuned and we're back you're watching Sophie and Cohen we're talking to Russian president's press secretary Dmitry Peskov I want to talk to you shortly about Trump and couldn't relationship because I know that the two men don't have hostilities on the personal level Trump has said many times that he actually likes Putin and he would like to mend ties with Russia but every time he tries to do something there is such an outrage whether it's from Congress or from the media that like it seems almost impossible so does it mean that no matter who the United States president is there will be no detent between Washington and Moscow well we hope for the better and and besides there is a very strong necessity in in maintaining dialogue between Washington and Moscow when we have severe constant conflicts like in Syria like Korean Peninsula in various other regions of the world it needs it means Russian American cooperation unfortunately we see that not all the bodies of power in the United States are or their opinion and yes we've heard lots of statements coming from American president saying that he would like to solve existing problems between us to through dialogue that is totally supported by his Russian counterpart mr. Putin but some we know that some people and in Congress in Senate they are of different opinion I do not know to what extent balance of powers in the United States and it's not our business we cannot interfere in those affairs and we don't have a slightest slightest wish to interfere in that situation to what extent that that balance of power can well can affect the future of our relationship but we still we still consider the the most important statements by by the President of the United States and we do hope that there will be a chance for President Putin and President Trump to sit down together sooner or later and to discuss existing problems we know that President Trump has made a phone call to President Putin he congratulated him mmm despite what was written in various newspapers despite Congress opposition growing gradually so he called him and and and they have reached and reached an understanding that they have to come together and they decided to instruct their foreign minister Lavrov and and what do you think of his appointment him replacing Tillerson I know you've said that you can't possibly go below ground zero so do you think that could things could get better with Mike Pompeo at the helm of the State Department we know that he's very experienced person he's a tough guy he's tough guy he's experienced person and International Affairs he knows International Affairs from a different angle not from angle of diplomacy but but well you know it's important to work with all the counterparts I mean you can sometimes you can you can find common grounds for discussions with the quite unexpected people do you know your counterpart in White House I mean you've been with putting for like 10 years and before right yeah and like before that you worked in the presidential pool even more than ten years or something like that I mean like Obama changed his secretary a thing four times trumping one year like four times or two times bush five times I don't know what kind of like longevity portion you're taking do you know your counterpart in America well yes unfortunately our presidents are not meeting frequently so this way we don't have a reason to contact each other frequently but but when they have meetings and they had two meetings they had two meetings in Germany and and and where and also there were some some contacts and then in Vietnam yeah so and we had some contacts with my counterpart so not detailed but but at least we know each other yeah so um you've mentioned in the beginning of the interview and everyone notice how putting and with into it megyn kelly said about yours sometime so you as you put it let's say did you take it seriously or was it like a joke were you like whoa where did that come from well every joke or the president carries a very important very very deep understanding well this is a well it's pretty if president criticizing you even half seriously half joke you have to take it into account well you know every every press secretary in this world is being criticized sometimes by his boss okay jokes put aside there is something that I won't talk to you about for instance I know like when I listen to Putin and he jokes it's funny I mean it listen Russia Russian language it is really funny and when he says witty stuff it's funny and I remember the panel with Megan pally when you know he was very tough and you know we're thinking it was so so cool and then yeah and then it was translated into English and it just didn't make any sense I mean the jokes didn't make any sense and he's wittiness didn't make any sense and I just realized that everything he says the way thing is so cool is completely lost in translation when it's translated into different languages I mean that mentality gap that even further widens it I think you are different you know what President Putin is Russian he's Russian and he's making his Giorgio's jokes as Russian and when when they're not interpreted correctly it's rather a problem of misinterpretation and and well sometimes sometimes yes we fill with different cultures different cultures sometimes we cannot understand jokes coming from outside and the same thing oh yeah where we trust I like Senators jokes or president jokes it doesn't make any sense in Russian either it sounds similar cynical that's it's you know it's it's national specialities it would be especially the specialities and it's rather it's rather our our Gandy cap and explaining our own president I consider it to be to be our mishandling of information so do you think more careful we have to be more creative in explaining those jokes yeah because that I mean I feel like that drives the gap between the mentalities I went further because you're like oh wow what is he talking about well you know it's like like British sense of humor sometimes it's very hard to understand so tell me something you've been with the president for a long time I mean it's only human that in 18 years either you get tired or getting know it or you get angry and you're like I want to leave do you ever feel like he was close to being like I want to go I can't do this anymore well you see when if you if you want to go and if you continue to work first of all it's unfair towards your boss and you have to be fair and if you work with the outstanding person like Putin oh not you know did you really wanted to DG or feel like he ever wanted to leave he doesn't any more important yes I think he doesn't have a boss no I don't think so I don't think so he's got a huge understanding of what to do to make this country better and he sees better than everyone in this country the scope of the problems he knows the problems of of different regions he knows the problems of people working in different spheres of economy of civil servants he knows ecological problems he knows problems of production problems of health care of social insurance and so on and so forth but at the same time he understands what can be the way the way of solving this problem and I can feel it working next to him that it's a huge drive for himself it's a huge drive for himself combined with sense of responsibility and that's why this is a great chance for our country this is a great chance for our country and a great chance and a great challenge for himself that's why you never wanted to leave him because that was gonna be my experience it's unbelievable a unprecedented experience and I can hardly imagine any other positioning in this world that that brings such an experience to you I'm just gonna ask you a last question about new eater I know that you and Putin and mostly all of Russia's government with the exception of Nevada aren't very tech Pro I mean you're very conservative guys but this Twitter thing and the whole social media thing is really changing the paradigm of how politics works and how diplomacy works and how media works yes it is and I mean we're all smiling or laughing at Trump waiting until you know he's meeting with the North Korean leader and you know maybe it's fair to say that Twitter did it's fair share in the meeting it's really changing the whole construction of how politics and diplomacy works are you guys not considering going on Twitter or going into Social Work I think that among all the tasks of technological breakthrough of this country there should be also a task of a broader usage of social media in explaining as state affairs to the root of number one to our own citizens and number two to the world Mithra Pisco thank you very much for this interview all the best of luck you
