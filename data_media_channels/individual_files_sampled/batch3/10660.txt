hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LeBeau the continuing saga how did three people in Salisbury survive contamination by a military-grade nerve agent London has a lot of explaining to do also nikki Haley goes off the rails again what exactly is a normal country crosstalking a world in crisis I'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Victor 11 he is a political analyst as well as a leading expert at the center for actual politics and we have Dimitri Babak he is a political analyst with Sputnik international ok gentlemen as always crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it Victor let me go to you first here using the word saga is an understatement here Brina bring us up to speed what's going on with this alleged poisoning incident in the UK so what has happened this week first of all miraculously all the Victor called victims of this poisoning have come back to full almost full health CDs people can is not only conscious now not only did he come out of a coma but he can speak his daughter Julia is fine and well doing really great she can speak on the phone she she is fine and the thing is the the fact is that that type of chemical that they accused of Russia of somehow using against Creepo if that would actually be used they would never be able not only to come out of a coma but they would know they would not be alive today second of all the British government denied visa request from city steeples nice to come and visit Shaggy's crippled and his daughter in London even though we have one today yes and one of the reasons given by the British authorities was that the cousin didn't have enough money maybe she would want to stay in Britain no they don't have sight of Polish farmers of course and to top it off several to tap you know of several hours ago news came out that the United States is considering taking Sergei skipper and julius cripple to its witness protection program so they will in so an alleged crime happened in the UK and they're getting witness protection in the US and and there is that isn't given that officially isn't given is that the United States would be the best place to prevent further assassination attempts against India I think that it's probably the best place will we'll never find out exactly the points on these people mark do we know that if Sarah gay anelia wants to go to the United States can they be compelled to go to the United States will we ever see them in front of a microphone well we will Yuliya ever be able to visit her family in russia again just like Jeremy Corbyn Peter the only reason that you would question any of this is because that you are attacking the United Kingdom as part of the Russian spin machine that is that is what the the British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was accused of doing by the British Foreign Minister source johnson truth is not a priority here right well the truth is not out of importance here III think basically you gave it a role name what happened there was not poisoning it was a an attack against the United Kingdom by the Russian Federation president use of chemical weapons and mark is right you know there is a joke making rounds in Russia you know Yulia scrip I was questioned by the British police if she noticed anything weird about you know before going to the head to the UK we know one of the versions that the poison was in that buckwheat that was brought to scrape off on his on his order from Russia so you know the police asked him did you notice anything weird she said nothing special just when I went to buy this buckwheat in the nearby store there was Putin in person selling it to me behind the counter that was the only weird thing that I noticed it was kind of strange its we can make jokes about that but the implications of this story are immense and it is a lack of legitimacy in the British government to tell the truth there actually are victims in this yes first of all it's the pets there is a cat that's that there's a guinea pig that belonged to skip all of that but the real victim is the relationship between Russia and the West and the British authorities have obviously chosen a road of confrontation with Russia they are going there willing to go the lengths to accuse Russia without any evidence not present the Kenyan evidence on the court in front of the international community and we banking on Rousseff would be doing the chair for the how in the rule of law the presumption of innocence innocence before proven guilty and we're forgoing the the right to dissent it has to be said that the pets died not because of some mysterious nerve agent but because the British government killed them cremated exactly right - - for whatever reason because we don't have a 15-minute memory here let's let's recall that we were told that they were the the British soil was attacked by a military-grade nerve agent a secret Soviet military-grade nerve agent that just happened to be on a British spy drama earlier in the last year that is ten times more powerful than VX military-grade now we were told the New York Times called it the nerve agent - deadly to use right the Telegraph said we should just let them die right but we have an explanation for this because all ears damned Gazeta who is is purported to be a a chemical weapon and security expert he came up with all kinds of reasons why they could have survived they could have been wearing gloves all three of them it could have been raining it wasn't they could have washed their hands afterwards if magically the nerve agent just disappeared you know this technology is really awesome they can't kill your cans the military's create all different kinds and qualities of nerve agents so not only did the Russian government commit an attack on a retired old swapped a spy who had already served time in prison in Boston had been squeezed by the FSB had been squeezed by the noise not only did they kill him with a super-secret Soviet nerve agent that would point a glowing trail back to Russia but they did it with a sub lethal dose that let all three of them survive - this is what we are supposed to believe but you could just draw the conclusion that this was a publicity stunt to drive a certain agenda well and many of those agendas are and the failure of the may government to deal with breaks it the failure of her own policies among the population as far as public opinion polls and being able to use the tried and honored Rousseau phobia that always does the trick we want to talk about a spin machine let's talk about this machine with Boris Johnson all right when he's still she's still 40 seconds really this is the public in the world and saying that it was certainly attributed to Russia by the portland's down scientists who then later contradicted this that was not a lie though that was he misspoke it was a mistake he exaggerated slightly it was an overstatement or a gaffe just take your choice that is a spin machine no I'll take he's incompetent indeed you know the problem was the IT Perry leaves when Boris Johnson said that he knew that these weapons were made in Russia and that this was made on president Putin's order he expressly expressly referred to down to laboratory he said that they told him the guy the guy I told him right and it was simply just a brutal way I would say and then I had to delete that tweet yes yes to cover up what they said also what happened you know when they destroyed the animals when they didn't come to the house for several days because the guinea pigs died of starvation well you've had you had a police officer standing next to the door for a number of days when he next - they poisoned exactly nah I don't know if that is not if that is not tampering with the evidence then what is a victory we have like to find out what happened we the official version secret eventually becomes now a public knowledge but when that eventually will happen we're with the ten years from now is it 20 years from now is it 50 years from now is a big question there's a little footnote to this the British are actually saying they never applied the used in the antidote to the so-called knowledge of them so they keep they came back to life because you know the Kevin antidote they would have to produce never choked in their cleaning they never hear that Peter we don't know what happened here and we may never know right because no real evidence the only evidence we have is is from the outlet rageous lies of the poisoning the most incredible story I have red moon of Alabama blog says that the effects of sea food poisoning act very much like a nerve agent like this read it for yourself it's at least more credible than the British government's version of what happened well I know what happened because I know what fooled you know the most important thing about the arson of Reichstag was not who personally who was the person who set it on fire let's compare that outcome you know it basically brought Hitler unlimited power back in 1933 in the same way I don't know exactly what happened in Salisbury I know the consequences I know how rational you know when when Russia convened a Security Council meeting of the United Nations Britain complained that they didn't wait until the results of the investigation well the UK went to the UN Security Council first even before the police investigation but in the process in the sphere of public opinion I think they're already lost because what happened was the rebirth of Soviet political jokes now these jokes are not directed against the governmental mercenary it's the government in America and in Britain let me just quote that you know the most humorous one the most recent one is you know the reason May is reported to be raped in London so they report it to Putin and Putin says to the officer who said it I have only one question am I the only suspect or is it the whole Russian people exactly I think we're exactly the independent said it best in their editorial the headline whether we can prove Moscow's involvement in the scribbled case or not is irrelevant the poisoning is severing Russians relations with the West I couldn't have said it better myself okay we're gonna do this we're gonna short break gentlemen over that short break we'll continue our discussion on some real news stay with RT welcome back to crosstalk war all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle true mind you were discussing some real news okay gentlemen I want to finish up on the first block here you summed it up really well mark at the end of the first part of the program no one else all three of you where do we go from here mark they they can't back down from this right if they back down from this the British government would fall and they can't let that happen because that would likely mean jeremy corbyn's election and that is what the british deep state a and and and you know the whole foreign policy elite fear most is jeremy corbyn the Labour Party leader being elected so they've got to get more outrageous with their lies and I I have a suggestion the satirical website the postilion headline British police find Putin's passport at scene of salus berry poison attack and I mean considering the number of passports that terrorists and everyone else have left laying around sometimes why not why not why not where do we go from here mark is right they can't and they will not back down and one way for them to go forward is another even more significant even more dangerous provocation against Russia so there may be another act that they blame on a Russia whether it's in the United States or in Great Britain remember Nikki Haley's words we're talking about session where she said what happens if there is an attack in New York City they may very well just organize something like that and then blame it on Russia with no evidence at all well they've proven you can get away with it exactly the precedent well for me the main problem the main question is how will Russia react until now Putin has always in these embarrassing situations for them he always left the door open for them he always let them save face you know the lies about Iraq Putin never raised it after after the war right the attack on Yugoslavia which was supposed to be justified by at least 100,000 kosovo albanians dead you know that turned out to be a lie they never found the graves but Russia allowed them to save face and to get out with it now I hope Russia will press on it because you know just like they say don't let Putin get away with it poutine has nothing to do with it but now the question is will Russia let them get away with it now if it does then it will continue and it's not a problem of Interstate relationship it's a problem of ideal ideological fight now there is a very aggressive new ideology which unites the United States the European Union the UK and and unless it is counted now it will get more than what I introduced this program as a world in crisis here Nikki Haley's name has already been brought up here I mean I obviously like to make fun of her you know I've said many times that she has advanced degrees and in a hillbilly studies I still believe that but you know she had some very fiery words from a chief diplomat it's quite scary Russia will never be America's friend Moscow can try to behave quote/unquote like a regular country but the US will quote slap them when we need to react to that Viktor that's the chief diplomat from the United States going at the United name two things first of all what does she mean by be like a regular country so that's why I wanted to do this the regular country is a country that tiptoes to Washington that father's house yes that does what the Uncle Sam essentially says what it tells them to do what it orders them to do and does incest thank you well I should be more like the Netherland and of course Russia has its own domestic and foreign policy just like child just like Iran just like Venezuela or Cuba it is exactly these countries that have their own view of the world that have their own foreign domestic policies that want a friendship with America but on their own terms that irritate the American foreign policy establishment so much from nikki Haley to John Bolton to Michael to be talking a lot about John Bolton on this program but you know Mark it's very interesting is that we have another round of sanctions came about we have this whole affair and in the UK and we have nikki Haley where Jen Bolton coming into this seems very well organized to me and I and I think that what Dima had to say the first part of the program is that you know now we have a precedent now we can see more of these shenanigans being played out to drive a specific agenda yeah and the latest is with these latest sanctions against Russian oligarchs and companies as they call them a handful and they say are close to Putin first of all Putin is probably just and a lot of the Russian people most of the Russian people are just saying thank you thank you for pressuring and scaring our you know oligarchs as such as it is into repatriating their wealth back to the motherland rather than spending it in New York or London and we're really happy with that but you know the most hilarious and ironic thing about all of this is that Russia's oligarchs back in the day when they really existed were created and celebrated by the Bill Clinton administration in Russia right that whole oh you know we saved we got Boris Yeltsin elected you know so these these these latest sanctions really again are quite toothless the intention is that they can force what they call oligarchs to overthrow Putin in a coup this has been the liberal hope for years knowing they can't win an election if you're trying a policy that's right well you have liberals that can't win elections and then you double down on policies that don't have any why do not have a Wishon because this is what the foreign policy experts on Russia in the West who fundamentally misunderstand Russians in the back of a postage stamp who got rid of the oligarchs and leashed them to the power of the state that's why there aren't any oligarchs per se like say Jeff Bezos or rather like Ukraine I I think that basically the sanctions list that was published today it is the most extensive in terms of effect because the really rich people are included you know a Vekselberg the head of a Renova company which is huge you know Alec Davis paska the head of Basel which is just about all Russia's metrology but I think the mistake that they're making is that they basically spread this Kremlin list sanctions list they have spread it to almost 100% of Russia's reach people so it looks like class struggle now if you want to really so discord between the Russian rich people then take 50% impose sanctions of them then maybe you know you will have a split but the problem is that the input centers of all of them Christ why did they do it because the American foreign policy is actually fed by profoundly wrong information there is no such science now as Russian studies it is all fake it's all ideologized the idea that they have is that Russia is run by a bunch of capitalists you know tied to the president and they have no base in society that looks very much like the Russia of the 90s which they liked and which the American elite Russia was bad when it was a monarchy Russia was bad when it was run by the Bolsheviks and the Communists in Russia is bad when it's run by capitalists so the the conclusion from this is that it's not it doesn't matter who Russia is run by but Russia itself is bad but no it was good when it was disintegrate whatever is here but you know the this the foreign policy lead in the West they project all of their real sins projected upon Russia Russia is here they say you know a normal country what kind of normal country is invade is in what may seven major conflicts around the world without any kind of international mandate breaking international law and a regular basis to be a normal consider themselves to be an exceptional country one the u.s. think of exceptional country and all the rest must listen and by the US doesn't want Russia to be like them god forbid they want Russia to be like the Netherlands sorry no I think they wanted to leave them alone do you like Ukraine because exactly there's a better analogy even in the Netherlands last week you had the Parliament castigating the anti Russian propaganda group called EU versus design for for what for a taking the Dutch media for publishing news from Russia calling it fake news the Dutch parliament rebelled and and they said that these people from the basically a government financed EU versus disinfo that they have no right to pass a judgement on what the Dutch media's report and whether it's fake news or not so Netherlands is too good you know Ukraine or maybe maybe Moldova or maybe Poland that would be the right way for Russia in their minds but they will it's never going to happen yes it's never gonna happen keep trying it he said America will never be America's friends and we will have to slap them around when the United States the United States don't have to be friends don't have to be friends but they don't have to be enemies either okay no who cares about the term friends when you're talking about geopolitics it's nonsense throughout the years even in Soviet times even in the 70s in the sixties in the eighties nineties the to thousands whether it's Putin or Brezhnev or Gorbachev or or and drop of or Gilson Russia has never not a single Russian leader in the past 50 years have said that I make it that Russia does not want to be friends with America an enemy never because in reality Moscow wants to have a good relationship with America Moscow doesn't want to have a confrontational relationship with Washington a confrontation with Washington brings nothing good to Russia is ultimately exactly what to the United States and one cave it to what Mark had said about the repatriation of resources of capital from Great Britain to back to Russia of course some resources are going to be repatriated to rush or to other markets but the British throughout the last several decades have shown themselves to be thieves they they do yes they they knew very well who is investing those resources who is putting that money those banks they knew it when those accounts were opened they knew it when those investments of billions of dollars were made they wrote about yes in there yes so it was not it was nothing surprised there are myths now what they're going to do they're not just going to allow all of it to be repatriated back to Russia what they're going to do is they're going to erase it he sees these resources and and who knows how they're going to use it because we already have from the experience with Libya and with Iraq we know the billions of dollars that were in these are considered may have simply this amazing rocket hang on Emily Katie the last 20 seconds of us I think you know their calculation that there would be a split in the Russian leaders room and their calculation that the Russian poor people will rebelled against the rich is also wrong and let me just remind everyone every time when people tried to confiscate all the property from the rich people in the UK in Russia it never made poor people happy it never produced affluent from that point there many thanks to my guess here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember Rostock rules now for the extended version of our program we have political potpourri Victor what's on your mind so the Department of Homeland Security is apparently getting a new system which will allow it to compile information on American media outlets on journalists who write on different topics from international affairs describe domestic policy or describe dance influencers influencer influencer employee and even if you and there's space for more than 250,000 in this database the news outlets use our words ends and journalists so even if you're right even if you write for you know news little newspaper in Cleveland or somewhere in Minnesota were Oklahoma you may end up in that database 250,000 what does that tell us about the state of American democracy what does that tell us about the future of the American Bill of Rights the deployment of common security is going to actually get it I thought that department was supposed to protect the homeland from Americans I guess from the truth I've always said the national security state is designed not to seek out and destroy potential terrorists no because they don't but they spy on us well they they they they watch people that could be of a threat to their system they're not and it's because people that think freely and dissent they're the biggest threat to the status quo going out many times and it's been written about in dozens of academic populations that the Terrorism powers granted with the you know the the Patriot Act and and this formation of the Homeland Security Department have been used many many many many many more times against protesters and political dissent in the United States than they have against any actual terrorists and then you know that just says it right there well like they moved to a slightly different part of the globe in Brazil Lula da Silva the most popular potential candidate for the presidential election scheduled for October 2018 was basically forced to go to prison for 12 years despite the fact that a huge majority of the population is against that and that he would be the likeliest win if he was a lottery I just think you know his former South American politicians when they got a fall out of favor with Washington they end up in prison well yes words are destroyed Yanukovych is corrupt young coach was so corrupt the EU had to apologize to him and to his prime minister they have been looking for his assets in the U for three years and the EU court ruled that that the Ukrainian government and the European authorities had to apologize to to mr. Zarif you know the Prime Minister because they didn't find him which like weapons of mass destruction and restoration it transpired that the new president mr. poroshenko had some access had some assets with Misha Fonseca you know the in Panama the Panamanian papers have revealed mr. poroshenko to be a beneficiary but that doesn't matter and now nikki Haley has said the truth in the duke university a few days ago when she said russia was never going to be our friend she also said we armed ukraine and this is not the last act that you are going to see from this administration against russia well she said the truth accidentally then there was an interview this week on on RT spanish by rafael correa the former leftist president of ecuador and he interviewed cristina kirchner the former leftist president of argentina and which of course they also discussed lula the former leftist president of brazil notice a pattern here and they asked themselves the question how did we let neoliberalism and it must be said the United States win and I think everyone should watch it I think it's it's it's painful at times to listen to it but you know I'm older than most people - probably even watch this program but I can remember Washington imploring upon the military dictatorships of South America to embrace democracy but when democracy is embraced people vote the wrong way and then you have to undermine democracy when Washington was imploring them to embrace democracy it was at the same time Washington was writing up those torture manuals for the school of Americans were used in Guatemala and in Chile and in other parts of which they make in fact very soon there is an election the presidential election coming up in Mexico and the leftist candidate is has a good chance of winning and we will see where the relationship between Washington and Mexico City will go from there also we don't note about leftist and rightist when we talk about Latin America what really concerns Washington is not the exact political the exact political leanings of the case of the of the President or the Prime Minister whether the leftist rightist whether they are red or white or whatever they care but whether they are willing to kowtow to the what if they're righteous and they don't like to do what Washington says Washington will act against them if they're left they will give us an example exactly hungry Monroe Doctrine is alive and well in Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban demonized by the EU for many years has won the election with a landslide and what was the reaction over there I wonder who is meddling the euro news over the euro news this is a victory for Putin whenever to seek Alban and Putin increased their influence in Europe the real person who is meddling there was Soros yes absolutely but when he'll be near to you the state US State Department was in league with Charles to meddle and Albanian we can't forget that as we should jump shift to Syria that the US has supported the Marxist Kurdish YPG in Syria when it suited their interests as well so as long as you follow or fall in line with u.s. foreign policy mister Clinton Trump said last time in the last two weeks that the u.s. needed to get out of Syria we need to get back to our own country where we belong let the other people handed it until Mohammed bin Laden Mohammed bin Salman the brat Prince of the Wahhabist dictatorship of Saudi Arabia visited the u.s. on a goodwill tour and and said that the United States Wahhabists on a goodwill deal with that phrase we cannot allow the u.s. to give up their checkpoint in Syria supposedly sometimes our fury George in between Iran Tehran and Damascus the US must stay medium-term if not long-term rehab center point out to our viewers of the United States is in Syria illegally the international law so Trump followed that elevate the travel that up by a comment well we could stay in Syria if Saudi Arabia pays for it now I want to explain to you as a former u.s. mercenaries the US president just pimped out the US military as mercenaries to the Wyss harvest dictatorship of Saudi Arabia to back theirs and it must be said Israel's interests in Syria and if American boys and girls start dying in numbers in Syria and your tax dollars are wasted it is for Mohammed bin Salman so it's interesting Mohammed bin Salman said it that the United States should stay in Syria that's his order Wow he has a lot right does he have to say that almost on the same day President President Trump has said we've got nothing from our 77 trillion dollars that was spent in the Middle East in the last 17 years so like we will be getting out of there very soon very soon well whose truth will prevail who rules the United States Mohammed bin Salman oh that's why I brought myself last week this is why I brought it up because I think it's so important here he Trump says the u.s. is getting out of Syria but the facts on the hoard see what is important here is that what does what the president the United States have to say on any particular issue have any meaning anymore okay we have North Korea the negotiations there well I'm sure we're gonna talk about the nuclear deal it's gonna probably the US will pull out and and may but do we count on his words or do we or do as he just completely surrendered I have to agree mr. Trump promised that we will be getting along very well very well with Russia now sixty diplomats out of the United States because something happened in Salisbury which they can't even explain what didn't happen or didn't happen or didn't happen at all so basically you see how the United States is run rather by Mohammed bin Salman than by the elected president and they call it a system of checks and balances you know checks and balances Donald Trump the elected president of the United States Saudis with some three hundred billion dollars of weapons purchases from the US between Obama's and Trump's presidency money talks yeah Mohammed bin Salman is certainly haveá in this juxtaposition all right gentlemen that's all we have time for this segment this has been our extended version of bullhorns we hope you've enjoyed it and we'll see you next week remember crosstalk knee slapper Russia you
