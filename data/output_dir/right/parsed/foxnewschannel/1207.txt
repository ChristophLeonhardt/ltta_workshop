STEVE: WELCOME BACK TO "THE NEXT
STEVE: WELCOME BACK TO "THE NEXT
REVOLUTION" WE'LL LOOK AT THE
OUT GOING GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN.
WE'LL LOOK AT THE ECONOMY AND
BUDGET.
IS JERRY BROWN KILLING
CALIFORNIA?
YOU CAN JOIN IN AT HOME.
NOW, LET'S START WITH
IMMIGRATION.
HERE ARE THE FACTS.
>> HI, STEVE.
THE DEBATE IS NO QUESTION.
CALIFORNIA IS GROUND ZERO.
THERE ARE 11 MILLION
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE
U.S.
2 MILLION OF THEM ARE IN
CALIFORNIA.
THAT'S 6% OF THE STATES
POPULATION.
NEARLY ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA
WORKERS ACCORDING TO RESEARCH IS
AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT.
LAST YEAR JERRY BROWN DECLARED
CALIFORNIA IS FIRST SANCTUARY
STATE IN THE NATION.
THEY LIMIT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES
FROM DEPORTING ACCUSED AND OFTEN
TIME CONVICTED CRIMINALS.
IT PROHIBITS SHARING INFORMATION
FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ON
CRIMES.
IT PROTECTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
FROM BEING ASKED ABOUT THEIR
STATUS.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS SUING
THE STATE.
21 CITIES AND TWO COUNTIES ARE
ALSO VOICING OPPOSITION TO THE
LAW EITHER WITH FRIEND OF THE
COURT BRIEFS OR INDIVIDUAL
LAWSUITS.
WHAT'S THE COST TO HARBOR SO
MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, A
WOPPING $23 BILLION PER YEAR.
THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE THE FIRST
STATE TO OFFER FULL HEALTH
COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS.
THIS WILL COST TAXPAYERS AN
ADDITIONAL $250 MILLION.
>> THANK YOU.
STEVE: LET'S GET THE DEBATE
UNDERWAY TONIGHT.
WE HAVE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL
CANDIDATE BRAD SHERMAN AND GRAY
DAVIS.
ANTONIO, LET'S START WITH YOU.
THIS IS ON TOP OF MANY PEOPLES
CONCERNS IN THE STATE.
IT FEELS LIKE FOR DEMOCRATS THIS
IS THE HEART OF RESISTANCE.
THEY WOULD LIKE TO EXPLOIT THIS
TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
LEGAL IMMIGRATION AND ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
I CAME IN HERE 1985.
IF YOU ARE HERE ILLEGALLY THAT'S
AGAINST FEDERAL LAW.
IT'S AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION.
WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO
COME HERE ILLEGALLY AND TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF US.
WE PAY TAXES EVERY SINGLE DAY.
DEMOCRATS WOULD LIKE TO SELL A
CAR WITH NO ENGINE.
THIS WILL STOP IN NOVEMBER.
STEVE: THIS SANCTUARY STATE IS A
REAL SHIFT FROM WHEN HE
PRESENTED HIMSELF AS A
REASONABLE MODERATE DEMOCRAT.
FEELS LIKE HE'S COMPLETELY
PANNERRING TO HIS BASE.
>> IT'S DONALD TRUMP PANDERING
TO HIS BASE.
SPLITTING UP FAMILIES THAT HAVE
BEEN HERE FOR 20 OR 30 YEARS.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP OBAMA DID
THAT TOO.
>> WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PUSHED
FOR, WHAT WE NEED IS
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION
REFORM.
WE ARE TRYING TO BRING
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
TO THE FLOOR.
IF THAT HAPPENS WE'LL HAVE A
SETTLEMENT TO ALL OF THIS.
INSTEAD WE SAY IMMIGRANTS ARE
RAPIST AND MURDERERS AND THAT
KIND OF -- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HE SAID.
STEVE: ONE AT A TIME.
HOW CAN ANY REASONABLE PERSON --
LET'S ASK THE QUESTION THIS WAY.
I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT ABOUT
NOT USING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM TO PENALIZE RESPONSIBLE
PEOPLE.
THE PRIORITY SHOULD BE
CRIMINALS.
THERE IS NO PRY OR
THERE IS NO PRI OR
THERE IS NO PRIORR
THERE IS NO PRIORITY FOR
DEMOCRATS.
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
FIRST OF ALL WE DEPORT THOSE AND
HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CEREAL
CRIME -- SERIOUS CRIMES.
IT'S REPUBLICANS THAT REFUSE TO
ALLOW US TO DEBATE IT ON THE
FLOOR.
WHEN THEY SIGNED THE DISCHARGE
PETITION AND RISE UP AGAINST
THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP WE'LL SOLVE
THE PROBLEM.
>> AGAIN, I'M HAPPY YOU BROUGHT
UP THE ISSUE OF COME
UP THE ISSUE OF COMPASSION.
AT WHAT POINT DO WE HAVE
COMPASSION FOR EVERYDAY LEGAL
AMERICANS THAT BUST THERE BUT.
PRIORITY IS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO
PEOPLE LIKE ME.
STEVE: I WOULD LIKE TO GET
GOVERNOR DAVIS IN ON THIS ONE.
>> FIRST, LET'S TAKE A STEP
BACK.
LOOK WHAT IMMIGRANTS DID IN 2017
ACCORDING TO THE FORTUNE 500
ALMOST 50% OF THE BUSINESSES
WERE STARTED BY IMMIGRANTS OR
CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS.
LOOK AT THE TOP 35, 57% WERE
STARTED BY IMMIGRANTS.
STEVE: I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS
CHALLENGING THAT.
NONE OF THE PEOPLE ARE
CHALLENGING THAT.
>> WE NEED TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES
OF THE LEDGER.
STEVE: WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT'S
INVOLVED IN THE BIDDING FOR LAW
ENFORCEMENT STOPPING PEOPLE FROM
BEING HERE ILLEGALLY.
>> JERRY BROWN INSISTED THAT 800
CRIMES BE WRITTEN INTO THE NEW
LAW SO THEY MUST COMPLY WITH
SOME REQUESTS.
800 CRIMES.
THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE.
REMEMBER, THE STATE HAS ONE
OBLIGATION.
TO REDUCE CRIME.
TO GET CRIME SOLVED YOU NEED HIM
GRANTS TELLING YOU WHO DID IT.
IF THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE CRIME
DOESN'T GO DOWN.
REPORTER: DO YOU SEE THE POLICY
AS A CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM.
>> THEY CALL THEMSELVES
DEMOCRATS BUT THEY ARE
SOCIALIST.
THEY RUN THE STATE INTO THE
GROUND FOR 30 YEARS.
STEVE: STICK WITH IMMIGRATION.
>> HOW COME ICE CAN'T COME IN
AND TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS IN OUR
STATE.
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED.
WE ARE A SANCTUARY STATE.
WE HAVE TO BE A SANCTUARY
COUNTRY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRANTS.
AMERICANS PAY TAXES.
AMERICANS WANT TO GO BACK TO
WORK.
STEVE: CONGRESSMAN, I HEAR YOUR
POINT ABOUT THE NEED FOR REFORM.
MY QUESTION IS IN THE ABSENCE OF
THAT YOU CAN'T JUST THROW
EVERYTHING OUT AND SAY WELL,
LET'S MAKE A POINT AGAINST
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THUMB ALL
OVER HIM AND PUT COMMUNITIES IN
DANGER.
>> YOU PROVIDE FOR THE
DEPORTATION OF THOSE CONVICTED
OF 800 DIFFERENT CRIMES.
YOU ARE NOT PUTTING COMMUNITIES
AT RISK.
STEVE: WHAT HAPPENED AT OAKLAND.
>> SHE MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO
FAMILIES WHO HADN'T BEEN
CONVICTED OF ANYTHING.
THEY WERE BREAKING APART
FAMILIES.
SHE SAID NO TO THAT.
ONCE WE GET COMPREHENSIVE
IMMIGRATION REFORM THEN
CALIFORNIA WILL COOPERATE WITH
THAT.
STEVE: PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> I HEAR COMPREHENSIVE
IMMIGRATION REFORM FROM
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
WE CAN AGREE WE NEED IT.
WITH REPUBLICANS AT LEAST TRUMP
SUPPORTERS MOST BELIEVE THAT IS
WITH BORDER ENFORCEMENT.
WE DON'T WANT MECHANISMS THAT
WORK.
WE WANT TO PROTECT DACA,
DREAMERS, AND FAMILIES.
STEVE: I JUST WANT TO ASK A
SPECIFIC QUESTION.
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
THIS IS THE BIG QUESTION
EVERYONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT LEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, ARE YOU
HAPPY WITH THE LEVEL OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION IN CALIFORNIA TODAY.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NONE OF
IT.
LET ME SHOW YOU THE PROGRESS
THAT'S BEEN MADE.
STEVE: HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT
BROWN?
>> 2.4 MILLION PEOPLE CROSSED
THE BORDER ILLEGAL.
THE LAST TEN YEARS 750,000.
THIS PROBLEM IS GOING DOWN.
PLUS, MOST OF THOSE IMMIGRANTS
IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE
BEEN FROM SOUTHEAST ASIAN NOT
MEXICO.
STEVE: THE COSTS ARE GOING UP.
HANG ON A SECOND, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE BIGGEST EXPENDITURE IS
IN CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION.
>> EDUCATION.
STEVE: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
SPENDING.
OF THE BUDGET.
JUST TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE ABOUT
HOW MUCH THIS EFFECTS EVERY
TAXPAYER IN CALIFORNIA.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS WITH
BIRTHINGS IN HOSPITALS THAT'S
DEVOTED TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO
THAT.
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.
STEVE: I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE A
GUESS.
>> LET ME TALK ABOUT TAXPAYERS
FOR A SECOND --
STEVE: PLEASE, THIS IS WHEN IT
GETS TO THE REAL DETAIL.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE
STATE'S HEALTH BUDGET IS SPENT
ON BIRTHS FOR THE CHILDREN OF
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS?
>> WHAT I DO KNOW THEY
INCREASE --
STEVE: DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO
THAT QUESTION.
>> I KNOW THE ANSWER --
STEVE: YOU ARE AVOIDING THIS --
>> WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER MY
QUESTION?
STEVE: I'M THE HOST OF THE SHOW.
I'LL TELL THE AUDIENCE THE
ANSWER.
IT'S A THIRD.
IT'S 30% OF THE BUDGET OF
CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST EXPENDITURE
ON THE CHILDREN OF PEOPLE WHO
