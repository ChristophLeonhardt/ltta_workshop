I know President Obama was here for the museum's opening last fall and I'm honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum today and every day of my presidency I pledge to do everything I can to continue that promise of freedom for african-americans and for every American so important nothing more important this tour was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms the anti-semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and Prejudice and evil
