I think over and over again there's this constant attempt to undermine his credibility and the movement that he represents and it's frustrating for not just him but I think so many of us that are trying to work to get this message out and it's and so I mentioned mr. john de but part of this is a two-way street like we we want we want to have a healthy dialogue not just with you but with the American people because he's fighting for jobs he's fighting to make this country safer but when you're constantly getting told that can't be true we doubt that you can do this this won't happen and that's the narrative when you turn on television every single day it's a little frustrating it's a little demoralizing to turn on the TV day after day and here can't do this this guy's not going to get confirmed no way they're going to go through just part of the conversation that happens in washing now I think with being president of the United States and no you have to y know I look I've been doing this a long time you've been doing this too I've never seen it like this Jim I've never and again I'm not I splat I'm not looking to go back and forth but you're asking for an explanation and I think that it's important to understand that whether it's the President himself the vice president the senior team the volunteers or the people who are out there just you know in America that voted for more walked the streets and put up a sign that you constantly told no no no and no watch him go yes yes yes every time and to come up to the next turtle and see someone put a block up gets a little frustrating
