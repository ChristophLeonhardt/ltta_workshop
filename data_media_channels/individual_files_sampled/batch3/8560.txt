♪ ♪ Dana: WE HEAR ABOUT CELEBRITIES CALLING FOR GUN CONTROL BUT THEN THEY STARTED MOVIES THAT PROMINENTLY FEATURE THEM. WE HAVE CALLED THEM OUT FOR THEIR HYPOCRISY AT THIS TABLE OVER THE YEARS BUT ACTOR ETHAN HAWKE IS OFFERING SOME REFRESHING HONESTY ON THE ISSUE. WATCH. PEOPLE TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT GUN CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY. I NOTICED RECENTLY IF YOU PUT IN A COLUMN EVERY MOVIE I EVER DID WHERE I CARRY A GUN AND WHERE I DON'T AND MY SALARY. IF I ASKED MY FATHER TO DO THE MATH ON THIS, I THINK IT WOULD BE ABOUT 92% TO 8%. Dana: SORRY, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE EVEN HAWKE. IT WAS MIKE BAKER FROM IDAHO. JUST KIDDING. OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS ETHAN HAWKE. IT'S TRUE ABOUT CIGARETTES TOO. Greg: YES. IF HOLLYWOOD ACTUALLY BELIEVED IN THEIR CAUSES, THERE WOULD BE NO GUNS AT ALL. YOU CAN IMAGINE IN "DIE HARD," BRUCE McLEAN FIGHTING TERRORISTS WITH A PEACE SIGN. I HAVE AN IDEA. THEY SHOULD APPLY GUN-CONTROL TO MOVIE GUNS. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THIS IS TAX MOVIES BY AMOUNTS OF GUNS AND BY THE AMOUNT OF BULLETS THEY USE FOR MOVIES. HOLLYWOOD'S GUN-CONTROL ACTIVISTS, AND THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM, WILL THEY BE OKAY FOR A GUN-CONTROL TAX ON MOVIES WITH GUNS? TAX THE BULLETS. $10,000 EVERY TIME THERE IS A BULLET. $100,000 FOR A GUN. WOULD THEY DO IT? SOMEBODY SHOULD INTRODUCE APPLE TOMORROW. I AM FULL OF IDEAS. Dana: THAT IS A GOOD IDEA. WHAT ETHAN HAWKE IS SAYING THAT IN MOVIES WHERE THERE IS GUNS HE GETS PAID 92% MORE THAN IF HE DIDN'T HAVE A GUN IN A MOVIE. HE WOULD GET PAID ABOUT 8% OF HIS USUAL. Jesse: HOLLYWOOD MADE MILLIONS OFF HIS GUNS. ALL OF THE ACTION MOVIES IN THE '80 ZEN '. DIE-HARD, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, EVERYONE HAS A GUN. Greg: QUENTIN TARANTINO. Jesse: ALL OF THAT STUFF MADE OF FORTUNE FOR THE STUDIOS. THEN COME AROUND AND SAY YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY GUNS FROM LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS. IT'S A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL. I WANTED TO BRING SOMETHING TO YOUR ATTENTION. THIS HAPPENED YESTERDAY. THERE WAS A SCHOOL SHOOTING, A 19-YEAR-OLD BROUGHT A GUN AND STARTED OPENING FIRE IN A SCHOOL IN ILLINOIS AND AN ARMED RESOURCE OFFICER SHOT HIM, NEUTRALIZED THEM, DIDN'T KILL HIM. SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES. THAT STORY WAS NOT COVERED ANYWHERE IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA ANYWHERE IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDI MEDIA. Greg: I WAS GOING TO DO IT TOMORROW IN THE MONOLOGUE. Juan: AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE. Greg: SO IT IS THE RULE. Juan: HERE'S THE THING. WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT SMOKING IN MOVIES, IT HAD AN IMPACT. WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAINED Dana: THEY STILL DO IT. Juan: THEY DO IT MUCH LAST. YOU THINK ABOUT HOW GAYS WERE DEMONIZED IN MOVIES, NOW IT'S NOT AN ISSUE. MORE BLACK ACTORS UP FOR COMPETITION IN LEEDS AND BIG MOVIES. IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE. TO SAY GUNS HAVE MADE MONEY FOR HOLLYWOOD, IN THE WAY, IT SEEMS TO ME, IT ENCOURAGES THEIR CULTURE. I GO TO THINGS LIKE GUNSMOKE, JOHN WAYNE, INDEPENDENT, SELF-SUFFICIENT AMERICAN MALE. BUT I WONDER IF AT SOME POINT IT WOULDN'T BE, WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. JUST BECAUSE IT'S GUNS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T DISCUSS IT. Greg: WHEN YOU SAY GUNS ENCOURAGE THE CULTURE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Juan: THEY REFLECT. THEY SHAPE THE CULTURE. IF YOU ARE A GUY AND YOU SAY I'M GOING TO HAVE A GUN. I AM A REAL MAN. BY THE WAY, I SAW HEAR MORE PARENTS SAY AS LONG AS THE VIOLENCE IS JUSTIFIED AND LIKE SELF-DEFENSE WHEN THEY DON'T MIND SEEING GUNS IN MOVIES. Jedediah: SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE WATCH TELEVISION AND MOVIES, THEY JUST WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED. I THINK ABOUT THIS EFFORT THAT COULD SANITIZE THESE THINGS, LET'S REMOVE THE VIOLENCE AND LET'S ONLY HAVE IT THAT IS NOT WHAT FILM AND TELEVISION SHOULD BE. SOME OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. I LOVE LIAM NEESON. I LOVE HIM IN THE TAKEN MOVIES. SOME OF THESE THINGS RELY ON THAT STORY LINE. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A CHASE OR YOU ARE HUNTING DOWN A KILLER AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE NO GUN. IT'S INTEGRAL TO THAT. I DON'T THINK, IT'S THE SAME ARGUMENT PEOPLE MAKE, OH, GREW UP PLAYING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES, YOU'RE GOING TO BE VIOLENT. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. Jesse: SO YOU ARE AGAINST GREG'S TAX PLANTED TAXI BULLETS. Greg: I WANT TO SEE THE GUN-CONTROL ACTIVISTS IN HOLLYWOOD ACCEPT THAT PLAN. Dana: IT'S TRUE THAT IF YOU READ AS A YOUNGSTER, JESSE. I Jesse: I DON'T LIKE THIS
