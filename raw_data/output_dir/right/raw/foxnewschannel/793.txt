00:00:09,503 --> 00:00:10,771
>> Tucker: EARLIER TODAY

2
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,973
PRESIDENT TRUMP BOWED TO HES

3
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:14,007
CRITICS AND SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE

00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:23,417
ORDER TO HALT THE SEPARATION OF

5
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:25,619
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AT THE

6
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:25,986
BORDER.

7
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:27,387
YOU ASSUMED DEMOCRATS WERE

8
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:27,754
THRILLED.

9
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:29,389
THEY GOT WHAT THEY DEMAND AND

10
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:31,191
OUGHT TO BE CELEBRATING.

11
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:34,394
THEY ARE NOT SENATOR HARRIS OF

12
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:37,030
CALIFORNIA TWEETED THIS:

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,764
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER DOESN'T FIX

14
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:38,999
THE CRISIS.

15
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:40,334
DETAINING CHILDREN WITH THEIR

16
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:45,572
FAMILIES IN CAMPS IS INHUMANE

17
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:47,808
AND WON'T MAKE US SAFE.

18
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:54,815
AND THIS SOUNDED SIMILAR TO HIS

19
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:56,650
COLLEAGUES:

20
00:00:56,783 --> 00:01:00,153
BY NOW YOU REALIZED LIKE MOST

21
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:02,155
DEBATES IN WASHINGTON THIS WAS

22
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:03,156
NEVER ABOUT WHAT THEY CLAIMED IT

23
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:03,590
WAS ABOUT.

24
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,892
THEY NEVER ARE.

25
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:06,927
THE LEFT DOESN'T BELIEVE AMERICA

26
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:08,495

27
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:11,632

00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:13,967
SOUTHERN BORDER LEGAL OR NOT.

29
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:14,968
MOST VOTERS DISAGREE.

30
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:18,639
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE AN

00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,073
HONEST DEBATE BEFORE THE

32
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:20,974
MID-TERM ELECTION.

33
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:22,175
THAT'S THE LAST THING DEMOCRATS

34
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:23,810
