Cat videos are so
popular on the internet
that they have become
universal shorthand
for the internet itself.
Cats are the mascots
of being online.
They re the epitome
of distracting,
useless and comforting.
All that the internet is
at its best and at its worst.
It’s time for cat massage. 
Or at least that’s how we
used to think of the internet.
Because lately, dogs
are taking over.
The online rivalry
between cats and dogs
plays out like a battle for
the soul of the internet.
Think about Twitter, where
every dog is a very, very
good boy and every
cat is hell bent
on destroying civilization.
Or YouTube, where we watch
cats stalk their humans,
and humans shame their dogs.
“Did you do that
to the pillow?”
One pet turns its
owner into prey
and the other
cowers to authority,
looking guilty, as
if exhibiting a kind
of human moral compass.
Nowhere is this
dynamic clearer
than in the
differences between two
of Japan’s most
popular pets.
Maru the Dog.
And Maru the Cat.
One of them is a
happy-go-lucky man
about town.
And the other is
a sullen weirdo,
who lives out his
days attempting
to fit his body into a series
of impractical containers.
Of course, when we
talk about the rise
of dogs on the internet, we’re
not just talking about pets.
We’re talking about us.
Think about it.
Movies and TV shows
have traditionally
had a very strong
preference for dogs,
because they can be trained.
But even if cats
could be tamed,
they wouldn’t agree to it.
They represent our wild,
uncultured, disobedient
sides, the stuff we
Google late at night when
nobody else is watching.
They are the chaos agents
of the animal kingdom.
Meow. 
And yet, if cats
are aggressive,
it’s in an ineffectual way.
Unlike a dog, a cat
couldn’t actually kill you.
Cats represent chaos
without any consequence,
which is kind of the
way we’ve been taught
to think about the
internet for a long time,
as a kind of
apolitical playground
where crazy stuff
happens, but one that’s
completely divorced from
the serious concerns
of real life.
The new rise of
dogs online tells us
something about how the
internet itself is changing.
We used to experience cats
online through janky message
boards populated with
memes and
viral YouTube videos
passed around by our friends.
Today’s internet,
though, is starting
to look more and
more like old media,
with big companies imposing
order, offering convenience
and extracting optimum value.
“The secret to making your
pet social media famous.”
Dogs represent this
professionalization
of the internet.
They can be dressed
up and made to perform
for their audiences in a
way that cats just won’t.
Maybe it’s not a surprise
that we’re also increasingly
turning to dog
content at a time
when social norms
are degrading.
Civil institutions
are crumbling,
and the weird antisocial
activities that happen
on the internet have
effects on real life, too  
sometimes terrifying ones.
The lawlessness of cats,
like the internet itself,
is no longer comforting.
Loyal, docile dogs who
do what they’re told
and who get along
with people and wear
bow ties, that’s comforting.
Now we’re even
starting to see a rise
in the popularity of internet
cats who act like dogs  
adventure cats who hike
with their owners, trudge
through the snow, and
swim, like in water.
We like these cat-dogs for
the same reason we’re drawn
to images of animals
acting like human beings  
getting haircuts,
and taking showers  
or animals who act against
instinct to make friends
with one another.
These videos reflect the hope
that we can restore order
to the internet, rein
it in and integrate it
into civil society,
that we can literally
take internet culture  
and put it on a leash.
“Right, Dolce?”
Look, I get it.
But let’s not punish cats
for the sins of the internet.
This is about us, not them.
Hey, this is Amanda.
This is Shane.
He edits the videos.
She writes the videos. 
You watch the videos.

And then tell us:
Cats or dogs?
Or birds?
Leave your answer
in the comments.
We are very thirsty.
