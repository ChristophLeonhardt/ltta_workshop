GUILTY. NOW FOR SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT. AINSLEY: THANK YOU, BRIAN. WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE WORK VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAS DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND NEARLY TWO DECADES OF POLITICAL SERVICE. WHAT IS HE LIKE AS A FATHER? STEVE: GOOD QUESTION. BRAND NEW BOOK GIVES AN UPCLOSE AND PERSONAL LOOK AT THE PENCE FAMILY THROUGH THE EYES OF ONE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN. IT'S CALLED WHERE YOU GO. LIFE LESSONS FROM MY FATHER. THE AUTHOR CHARLOTTE PENCE JOINS US RIGHT NOW, LIVE. LET'S START WITH THAT PICTURE. WHERE IS IT. IT'S FROM. SANDRA: BELL FLORIDA. SO MANY BOOM THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. HOW DO YOU FACED A VERSE CITY BEING IN A POLITICAL FAMILY BECAUSE THERE IS SOME NASTY HEADLINES OUT THRNCHT YEAH. MY DAD HAS ALWAYS REALLY TAUGHT US THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SEE PROTESTERS, HE ALWAYS HAS THIS THING THAT HE SAYS THAT'S WHAT FREEDOM LOOKS LIKE. SO FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT WAS PART OF THE JOB. PART OF PUBLIC LIFE WAS THAT YOU MIGHT TAKE CRITICISM BUT THAT MEANS THAT THE AMERICAN SYSTEM IS WORKING THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. STEVE: SO WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP, WHAT WERE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE TIME MY DAD IS GIVING ME A LIFE LESSON BUT TURNS OUT IT WAS ADVICE THEN THAT CAN HELP ANYBODY NOW. OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. MY DAD ALWAYS TELLS PEOPLE TO SPEAK THEIR DREAMS. AND WHEN HE MEETS PEOPLE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND EVEN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, HE WAS ALWAYS TELLING US TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT OUR DREAMS WERE. SO HE WRITES THE FORWARD FOR THE BOOK AND IN IT HE TALKS ABOUT TELLING ME THAT I WAS A WRITER FROM A YOUNG AGE, WHICH WAS JUST VERY ENCOURAGING TO ME. AINSLEY: IN THE FORWARD HE TALKS ABOUT YOU BEING THE AT THIS TYIS TYPICAL MIDDLE CHILD THOUGHTFUL. I SAW YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TIME AND TIME AGAIN. STEVE: SQUASHING DAD IN THAT PICTURE OH, WOW. AINSLEY: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A PART OF THE PENCE FAMILY. YOUR FAMILY SEEMS FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD TO BE VERY, VERY CLOSE. EVERY TIME I INTERVIEW YOUR DAD YOUR MOM IS WITH HIM EVEN ON THE BORDER. SHE TRAVELS EVERYWHERE WITH HIM. EVEN ON THE BORDER. EVAN IN YOUR HOUSE BEFORE. HAVE YOU SCRIPTINGS ON THE WALL THAT ARE FRAMED. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE WHEN THE DOOR CLOSES, WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE INSIDE THE PENCE HOUSEHOLD. I TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK THAT WE KIND OF REFER TO OURSELVES AS A CIRCLE. THAT KIND OF ONCE YOU ARE IN THE CIRCLE YOU ARE NEVER OUT. AND SO IT WAS A SPECIAL TIME ESPECIALLY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR US TO TEST THAT CIRCLE EVEN WHEN WE ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED. THE TITLE OF THE BOOK IS KIND OF THAT THEME OF WHERE YOU GO I WILL GO WITH YOU. AND SO. AINSLEY: THAT'S FROM THE BOOK OF RUTH. YEAH, I THINK OUR FAMILY STAYS CLOSE AND WE SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER FROM WHEREVER WE ARE. STEVE: THERE IS EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK WE ARE GOING TO READ. THIS IS YOUR FATHER TALKING TO BARON TRUMP, THE PRESIDENT'S SON, AFTER THE ELECTION RESULTS CAME IN THAT NIGHT. AND YOU WRITE: YOU WANT TO READ THIS. SURE, YEAH. I OVERHEARD DAD TALKING TO BARON RIGHT AFTER. IT WAS A MOVING EXCHANGE. DAD TOLD BARON HAD CASS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY HIS DAD WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND HE THANKED THE YOUNGEST TRUMP FOR LETTING US SHARE THIS WITH YOU. STEVE: DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR? YEAH. IT WAS GREAT. THAT NIGHT WAS AMAZING ELECTION NIGHT. GUY INTO DETAIL ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK. THAT WAS REALLY SPECIAL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH THE TRUMPS. AND THEY REALLY DID INCLUDE US IN THE SAME WAY MY DAD IS INCLUDED MY SIBLINGS AND I IN EVERYTHING WE WANT TO DO WITH THEM. STEVE: SURE, ON THE BIGGEST NIGHT OF YOUR DAD'S POLITICAL LIFE HE SPENDS TIME TALKING TO THE PRESIDENT'S LITTLE CHILD, SMALLEST CHILD. YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW, THEIR FAMILY WAS SO INCLUSIVE AND SUPPORTIVE OF US THE WHOLE TIME. AND THEY WERE JUST REALLY AMAZING TO WATCH. THEY ARE A STRONG UNION REALLY INSPIRED ME. AINSLEY: WHAT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR DAD THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT? I WRITE ABOUT I WANT PEOPLE TO SEE HOW GREAT OF A DAD HE IS. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAYS ALL THE TIME IS KIND OF CORNY, BIGGEST TITLE HE WILL EVER HOLD IS THE TITLE OF DAD. AND I HOPE THAT THAT COMES ACROSS THAT HE HAS HELD THAT TITLE VERY WELL. AINSLEY: I LOVE THE IDEA OF WHAT YOU DID IN THE LAST CHAPTER. YOU WROTE A LETTER TO YOUR CHILDREN. YEAH. AINSLEY: READ THAT LETTER. GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA. YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS YET TO GO AHEAD AND WRITE A LETTER
