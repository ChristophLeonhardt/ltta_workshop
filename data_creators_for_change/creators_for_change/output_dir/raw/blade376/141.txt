00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,210
hi everyone how's it going miles diet

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,330
here played 376 love he<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be making</font>

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,370
comments recently saying that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,630
been doing videos like I yeasty this has

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a comment that's been made</font>

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,480
year-on-year really go back to saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,880
did maybe three four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,769
where I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just walk about talking</font>

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,160
and doing videos like this but I guess

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,449
the point I'd like to make is although

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,689
maybe the method in which I conduct my

12
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,910
videos the way I film has changed I

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,930
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that mean changing so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am I</font>

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,280
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep videos about things that</font>

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,800
matter to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about things I think are</font>

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,620
relevant in the moment and I guess the

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,910
reason I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing video light it stays</font>

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,940
also because it is a really nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and</font>

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,210
being so on who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> saed sad seasonal</font>

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,120
affective disorder it does have a plus

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,440
side because you know I always talk

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,199
about peaks and troughs and you know

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,000
although through winter I feel awful

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it is sunny like this it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feels</font>

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,040
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more amazing some who</font>

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,159
perhaps doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> s ad so I guess</font>

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I like colors like black and</font>

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,490
white it's why I like contrast in light

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,619
it's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like heavy metal music that</font>

30
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,780
has melodic singing because when you

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,049
have contrast it makes you appreciate

32
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,189
each end of the spectrum even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more by</font>

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,259
the way do you like my band shirt

34
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:33,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're really cool and it goes with the</font>

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,630
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of contrast actually but yeah</font>

36
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,549
should I wanted to talk about an issue

37
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,439
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to a project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font>

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,140
working hard on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past month which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,360
the universal solutions project and this

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,710
project is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be released publicly</font>

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,930
soon let's do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work needs to be</font>

42
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,970
done by working with hundreds of

43
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,530
volunteers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are from over 50</font>

44
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,360
different countries around the world and

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,189
its really inspiring and I know the last

46
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">few videos I've done have been sort of</font>

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,780
presentations about the concepts

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,719
underlying it but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,669
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that can</font>

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,860
really bring everyone together because

51
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,310
it's about the issue of problems

52
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,099
just person right now and so the

53
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,720
question I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put for today is the</font>

54
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,459
fact that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are dealing with</font>

55
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems in society do you think that is</font>

56
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,730
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal problem that occurs for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

57
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,220
one demographic what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

58
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,099
a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think any</font>

59
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,410
problem in life is a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and</font>

60
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,150
so the question I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propose</font>

61
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,080
today is in your frame of reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

62
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,810
a frame of reference relates to the

63
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,090
things you see in the street the things

64
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,810
that are in mind in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your life right now</font>

65
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,610
the things that you Patsy on the news

66
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,290
things that matter to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what is</font>

67
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently going on in your world whether</font>

68
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,600
it's on a local national global level

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,989
type each problem as a separate comment

70
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,970
to this video and then have a look down

71
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,239
on other people's comments and thumb up

72
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,860
ones that you think are relevant to you

73
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,349
or matter to you and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find</font>

74
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all the comments that are expressed</font>

75
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not individual problems but they're</font>

76
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,420
in fact global problems there in fact

77
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,540
human problems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think when we start</font>

78
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,090
to take that approach when dealing with

79
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,910
things in the world you know we realize

80
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,430
that humanity<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to come together and</font>

81
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,010
deal with things not as demographics for

82
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,400
example if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about equality</font>

83
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,410
politicians all the time are talking

84
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,569
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> making equal numbers of men and</font>

85
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">women in politics equal numbers of</font>

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,209
ethnic groups in politics and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

87
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they deal with this problem is by</font>

88
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,069
positive discrimination by saying okay

89
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,200
if we got two candidates one white one

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,010
black and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have equal capabilities</font>

91
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,019
based on positive discrimination we

92
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,930
would employ the minority and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

93
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,150
this aren't we kind of saying that the

94
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,400
quality can never be artificially

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,859
created because by trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

96
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,290
equality you're actually going against

97
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,819
the quality by treating people

98
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,069
differently and I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> Morgan</font>

99
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,600
Freeman<font color="#E5E5E5"> once in an interview talking</font>

100
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,850
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Black History Day and he didn't</font>

101
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because he said do you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

102
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,260
white History Day he goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> well then in</font>

103
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,550
that case I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want a Black History</font>

104
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,480
Day and the issue is

105
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,310
start making issue of things based on

106
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,200
demographics and not based on human

107
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,410
problems you are making things device if

108
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are separating people and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

109
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,200
bringing people together that way and I

110
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,610
guess I wanted to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this for a</font>

111
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,530
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a video I've been doing on my</font>

112
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,410
podcast but I think when the news of a

113
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,330
summer bin Laden being killed this

114
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,550
morning and seeing people take to the

115
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,580
streets in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. saying USA USA I</font>

116
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,830
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of asked those people do you really</font>

117
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,980
think it's about USA USA<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you</font>

118
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,690
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about making the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world a</font>

119
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,210
better place as a whole so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that note</font>

120
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,420
I should probably um head back home now

121
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,790
and I really look forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing</font>

122
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,250
your thoughts think of any problems that

123
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,100
are in mind whether they are local

124
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,290
national or global post them as

125
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,900
individual comments and think about

126
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,310
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they are individual</font>

127
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,250
problems based upon individuals or

128
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,200
particular demographics of human beings

129
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,350
or are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they human problems and I think</font>

130
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,630
when we start having that mentality

131
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,520
patriotism all these elements are so

132
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,680
traditional I think we'll slowly<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear</font>

133
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,200
away in society because we realize we

134
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
just want to come together we want to

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,130
help each other we want to tear away the

136
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,490
brands that separate different activism

137
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,350
groups and charities which are trying to

138
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,930
eradicate poverty and say why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we</font>

139
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,580
come together and based on that

140
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,380
philosophy that is what the universal

141
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,940
solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects I've been working on</font>

142
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,730
lately is about and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

143
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to become something very very huge and</font>

144
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,840
anyone who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help out with that</font>
