this too is a very key day for Apple
I usually go through a few updates but
we have so much to cover today I'm
dispensing with those other than to tell
you everything's great
these are the new iPhones the iPhone 6
and the iPhone 6 plus here's their sizes
4.7 inch for iPhone 6 5.5 inches for
iPhone 6 plus and boy are they packed
with pixels the iPhone 6 1334 by 750
that's more than a 720 HD display in the
iPhone 6 plus 1920 by 1080 full 1080
display with an even higher density
we've created an entirely new payment
process and we call it Apple pay your
total is 23 70 that's that
and everyone is love what we do just
last year was slow-mo videos up to 120
frames a second well now the 6 and the 6
plus can take video up to 240 frames a
second
we have one more thing
it's also very light with a no frills
super thin toolbar and favorites built
right into the address bar on the right
notifications have been joined by a new
today tab
