00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,440
Hey! This is Nadir from BENI

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,540
Sorry I missed your call but I'm not home right now but

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,400
please leave a message after the beep!

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,700
Hi.

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,260
I know I shouldn't feel this way...

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,140
and I can't believe I'm telling you this.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,360
This month, has been really difficult for me.

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,740
I haven't got much sleep.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,720
I said something I didn't mean

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,640
I'm finding it really hard to stay positive.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,640
When Mum died I didn't know what to do

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,780
I can't get through to my brother, he's just always angry

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,120
I'm worried about them adjusting to a new family

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,960
Just don't know what I'm doing with my life

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,240
I keep reading these horrible comments

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,360
I've been feeling pretty lonely

17
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,480
Hey, its me Nadir

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,820
If I've learnt anything from (starting) BENI

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,920
despite how hard things get

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,340
what gets me through the day is knowing there are other people just like me.

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,460
Fightint their own battles

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,760
Their own imperfections

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,960
Their own demons

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,080
And thats ok, because its what makes us human

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,000
An an immigrant

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,360
As a Father

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,460
Child

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,720
A man

29
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,920
As a woman

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,820
Our stories bring us together

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,840
They let you know you're not alone

32
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,180
Your voice is significant

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,600
and you can take on the whole world

34
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,100
This month I learnt that even when the day is long and life is hard

35
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,060
its good to take a step back and realise its not only about the food

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,320
Its about the love that runs deep

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,980
The bonds that connect us

38
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,340
The energy that pushes us to be better

39
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,980
Better partners

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Better daughters

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,600
A better listener

42
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,460
Better friends...

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,220
Its about knowing you persevered through your struggles and turned your weaknesses to strength.

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,940
So now in the future, when life feels at its lowest.

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,500
Know that you will connect with people.

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,120
You will fall in love

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,640
You'll still be forgiven

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,300
You'll always push through

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,020
So take this with you this Eid.

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,060
Take this with you even further.

51
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,740
That when the world is against you

52
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,780
you'll always be left standing.

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,620
Thats your story.

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:00:00,000
Eid Mubarak
