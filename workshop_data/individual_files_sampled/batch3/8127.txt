Martha: STORY OF THE NIGHT RIGHT HERE. A MICHIGAN COUPLE GETTING THE SHOCK OF THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY GOT AN ALERT FROM THEIR SECURITY CAMERA IN THE DRIVEWAY. IT WAS KIND OF LIKE REALLY UNUSUAL. I'VE NEVER, EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. I WAS LIKE WOW. THAT IS AN ANGEL. THE PHOTOS ARE EXACTLY HOW THEY WERE TAKEN. I THINK IT'S AN ANGEL. Martha: TAKE A GOOD LOOK. MANY, INCLUDING THEIR PASTOR SAID THAT THEY BELIEVE THIS IMAGE, CAPTURED, CAPTURED BY A SECURITY CAMERA SHOWS AN ANGEL HOVERING OVER THE FAMILY STRUCK LAST WEEK. SO COULD IT BE? AND IN THE NEXT PICTURE, I THINK WE HAVE IT, IT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE IT HAS MOVED TO A DIFFERENT PART OVER THE TRUCK. JOINING ME NOW IS AN EXPERT. PASTOR DON PIPER WHO WAS WRITTEN ABOUT HIS OWN EXPERIENCE. HE WAS IN A TERRIBLE CAR ACCIDENT AND HE SAYS HE DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN AND CAME BACK. HE IS THE AUTHOR OF "PEOPLE I MET AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN." PASTOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. I'M SURE THAT YOU BELIEVE THESE FOLKS WHEN THEY SAY THAT AN ANGEL, RIGHT? I DO. I THINK WE ARE AROUND THEM ALL THE TIME. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT WE SHOULD TREAT STRANGERS WITH ABSOLUTE COURTESY BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW IF THEY ARE AN ANGEL AND WHAT THAT SAYS IT IS WE ARE TO PROBABLY TREAT EACH OTHER BETTER AS HUMANS, BUT IT ALSO SAYS THAT ANGELS ARE EVERYWHERE AND WE MAY NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHO WE ARE TALKING TO. IT COULD BE AN ANGEL FLYING ABOVE OUR TRUCK AND ANYTIME, ANYPLACE, ANYWHERE. Martha: THIS WAS A MOTION ACTIVATED SECURITY CAMERA THAT THEY KEEP ATTACHED TO THEIR HOME TO LOOK OUT OVER THEIR DRIVEWAY AND THEIR CAR. SO THEY BELIEVE THAT THE MOTION OF THIS ANGEL THAT THEY FEEL THEY SAW IS WHAT SET OFF THE MOTION DETECTOR AND THEY WERE ABLE TO TRAP IT ON THE VIDEO, WHICH YOU CAN DO IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE CAMERAS. IT'S A VERY STUNNING, BEAUTIFUL IMAGE THAT THEY GOT. BUT TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE, PASTOR PIPER. YOU WERE IN A CAR CRASH AND YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED INSTANTLY TO THE GATES OF HEAVEN. TELL ME ABOUT THAT. EXACTLY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH, AND I WAS KILLED IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH AN 18-WHEELER, TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK. WE ARE ABSENT FROM THIS BODY AND PRESENT WITH THE LORD. IF WE ARE PREPARED TO GO, I WASN'T PLANNING TO DIE THAT DAY BUT I WAS READY AND IT WAS TRANSPORTED BY ANGELS IN THE TRANSPORTED TO HEAVEN BY ANGELS TO ABRAHAM'S BOSOM, AND THAT'S ANOTHER EUPHEMISM IN THE BIBLE FOR HEAVEN ITSELF. IF WE GO THERE BY VIRTUE OF ANGELS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS DYING FEEL LIKE THERE'S A PRESENCE IN THE ROOM AND USUALLY THERE IS AND I ARRIVED AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN AND WAS GREETED BY PEOPLE WHO HELPED ME GET TO HEAVEN WHO PRECEDED ME IN DEATH. I WAS SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF HUMANS, BUT THERE WERE ANGELS ANGELS ARE NOT JUST LITTLE CHERUBS PLAYING HARPS ON CLOUDS. THESE ARE ROBUST AMAZING CREATURES. SOME HAVE SIX WINGS. SOME HAVE FOUR, SOME HAVE TWO. SOME HAVE NONE. BUT I COULD HEAR THEIR VOICES AND I COULD ACTUALLY HEAR THEIR WINGS. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MOST STUNNING AND MOST ENCOURAGING AND COMFORTING. Martha: AMAZING. YOU SAY THAT WHEN YOU WERE THERE I JUST WANT TO PUT UP A GLASS PIPE DEMOGRAPHIC ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACCORDING TO GALLUP WHO BELIEVE IN ANGELS AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO BELIEVE IN ANGELS. 72% SAY THEY DO AND YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER NUMBERS THERE. YOU SAY THAT EVERYONE THAT YOU SAW WHEN YOU WENT TO HEAVEN WAS SOMEONE THAT YOU KNEW. THEY WERE. I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT I DID NOT KNOW IN THIS LIFE WERE INSIDE. THEY DID NOT COME OUT TO GREET ME. I THINK THE ONES I GREETED AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN WERE THE ONES WHO HELPED ME GET THERE. WHICH OF COURSE WHEN I CAME BACK, THAT MOTIVATED ME ALL THE MORE TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE INTO HEAVEN BECAUSE I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE HELPED ME GET THERE THE QUESTION ULTIMATELY IS WHO ARE YOU GOING TO GREET? WHO ARE WE GOING TO GREET WHEN WE GO THERE? I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE WE HELP GET THERE. THERE WAS AN ANGEL BACK HERE ON EARTH WHEN I RETURN. A MAN CLIMBED IN THE CAR OF THE WRECKAGE BECAUSE HE FELT LIKE I TOLD HIM TO. HE PRAYED OVER THE BODY AND I DID RETURN BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PRAYING FOR ME WHO DID NOT ALREADY KNOW I WAS DEAD. IT WHEN I CAME BACK, I MET HIM THREE WEEKS LATER AFTER I RECOVERED ENOUGH TO BE CONSCIOUS AND I TOLD HIM THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR PRAYING FOR ME. I FOUND THAT HE PRAYED FOR ME, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HE HELD MY HAND. Martha: THAT'S AN AMAZING STORY.
