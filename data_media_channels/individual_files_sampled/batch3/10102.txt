pro-immigration rallies been held in Paris earlier following president macrons initiative to tighten laws on refugees people there say he stepped back from his promise to help migrants get off the streets and out of the woods let's talk to a loved Dubinsky she was there for that rally hi there Charlotte how did it go it's gather it's over now yes it is over and they were many hundreds of people who turned out for that rally it seemed that this new immigration law that was presented to Frances cabinet this morning it could be one of the biggest hurdles that president macron has faced in his presidency so far here in France well what's in the new proposed law let's take a look at some of the measures now they include doubling the time that detention that migrants could be held in detention from 45 to 90 days jailing for up to one year migrants who illegally cross into France and also shortening the time that they have to apply for asylum and that has angered many people many people were on strike and took part in a rally on Wednesday morning to let president Matt Kahn know how unhappy they are about this new proposed law which they say will reduce the rights of migrants and asylum seekers here in France when they say the French state should be doing more to help them but viola well it balconies is not good it has not been passed yet but people won't like it because it won't solve the situation with asylum seekers I think it's a law that's selfish it's a law that people don't like and a law that foreigners they like no one likes this law is in balance because it's trying to facilitate the integration of refugees over people who are trying to prepare their documents it will become more and more difficult to be treated equally as refugees in France of course national security is important and we're not saying anything against that and of course certain profiles of asylum seekers could potentially represent a risk in France but it's a very small minority a very very small proportion and I think that French law already has many ways of tackling these issues and I don't think that reducing rights of asylum seekers as a whole is is a better way of protecting national security by undermining fundamental rights of all the other asylum seekers well many people within macrons own party lacrima Republic on Marsha also unhappy with this bill saying that they cannot support it in its current form however there are many people on the opposite side of the spectrum who say that this bill doesn't go far enough and they actually support it including the Republicans here in France now one of the things that this law aims to deal with is those migrants who use fake IDs and that's that's caused a lot of concern for many people here in before because some people have carried out terror attacks have used numerous fake aliases and fake IDs to be able to avoid detection including those who are behind the Paris attack in 2015 the Brussels attack over the border in Belgium in 2016 and also more recently last year in Marseille where the perpetrator of that attack in which two people were killed had used several fake IDs to avoid detection by the police now some are also concerned on a more wider scale in Europe but some people who apply for asylum are actually looking to carry out terror attacks such as the perpetrators behind the Brussels behind the Berlin market Christmas market attack just a few years ago the attack in Stockholm in Sweden and also in Turkey in Finland so some people say this law doesn't even go far enough what we do know is that this is do to be debated by the parliamentarians here in France in April and it is not going to have a smooth ride no it doesn't look like he does it Charlotte thanks the update there shall I do been skiing Paris
