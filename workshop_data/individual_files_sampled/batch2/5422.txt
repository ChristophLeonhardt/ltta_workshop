on November 6 you have the chance to stop the radical Democrats by electing a Republican house and the Republican Senate Democrats have become totally unhinged they've gone they've gone crazy the Democrats have become too extreme and they become frankly too dangerous to govern they've gone wacko you don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob and that's what the Democrats have become so President on the road this week out ahead of the midterms you heard the message there vote Republican or risk mob rule by the Democrats this is the new talking point just in the past few days listen for it already in heavy rotation as our friends at the 8:00 p.m. our compiled tonight the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob the far-left mob is not letting up they have encouraged mob rule anyone who's a trump supporter we're all targets of this there is only one party that has normalized violence in America in the last two years and it's not the Republicans with this mob rule my rule about a mob rule basically mob rule no law and order do you want mob rule yeah the average citizen if you're on the right should be concerned and in danger back to the event in Iowa tonight plenty of anger on display in the arena this evening including a familiar chant but this time directed at a new target how about senator Feinstein that's another beautiful that's a beauty did you leak the documents well huh right what no either did we leak generally No and I think nets are get about Feinstein can you believe it well with us to talk about what we witness tonight and going forward Nancy cook White House reporter for Politico and Kimberly Atkins chief Washington reporter for the Boston Herald well Kimberly what you dreaded you get to go first is our fear and anger motivators that are likely to sustain for 28:29 long days here until the midterms well the Republicans seem to think so it's it's a unified message that has brought them together from the hill to the White House that you see the president there and and Senator McConnell and others really doubling down on it we've seen the president turned to fear before whether he's pushing immigration policies or other things but it's clearly very important for the Republicans right now to try to keep the momentum up that they saw from their base in particular after the fight over the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh it seems that these rallies that the President does stumping for various midterm candidates is a test kitchen mess a messaging test kitchen of sorts and it seems that the crowd really responded to it so I think this is something that you're going to continue to see they sure are taking mob rule out for a spin hey Nancy I want to show you something else the president apparently miffed tonight when he discovered the number of Nebraskans in the crowd after being promised an event in Iowa we'll listen to what talk about it on the other side today I kept another major promise as I said to the people of Iowa and Nebraska and other country I could go on on that but I want to get the hell out of here okay because I thought I was coming to Iowa and there's more people from Nebraska well let's uh just consult the map here for a second president landed tonight in Omaha and Nebraska where it is possible to drive south just across the river into Council Bluffs Iowa where the rally was held so the rally was held in Iowa you're going to attract a lot of Nebraskans a lot of red corn Husker wearing Nebraskans Nancy I don't know of another politician who can get away with I want to get the hell out of here yeah well I think that you know you have to keep in mind you know trump at these campaign rallies having been at a bunch myself the crowd is just in the palm of his hand and I think that that's why he likes going on these campaign style rallies so much because it is such a friendly environment and the White House is feeling like it's on this hi after getting Covino confirmed even though it was a very contentious partisan fight the president now has a foil heading into the midterms you know he's talking about Democrats as a snob rule and so he's doing all of these rallies this entire week he was in Iowa tomorrow he's going to Pennsylvania Friday's going to Ohio and you know even though he could say anything to this crowd like I want to get out of here or you know chanting about locking up senator Feinstein that's what the crowd was doing tonight and everyone goes along with it it's really sort of an adoring situation for him and he loves it he eats it up well Nancy while we're there you just mentioned the upcoming rally scheduled and a lot of people noticed today it looks like a 2020 rally travel map more than just a 2018 mid-turn map well I think that honestly that has been the plan even since August you know I've talked to Republicans close to the White House who really laid out to me the idea that moving ahead so much of these rallies strategically are in places that Trump will need to win in 2020 in states like Florida and you saw some of the rallies that he did in August in Pennsylvania and places like that where the Senate or congressional races were a bit more of a toss he did those rallies a bit earlier and as we moved closer towards the midterms he's gonna do rallies in places where he thinks he'll be more successful and as you said he is really trying to create and build support heading into 2020 and Kim the section of the West Wing where they worry about things like polls they've got a problem with independence post Cavanaugh and increasingly they have a problem with women who are telling pollsters there would they will vote for a Democrat in their congressional district you see that far category let's round it 70 to 30 that's bad news for the Republicans yeah this is a key Democrat demographic going in to these midterm elections I mean I'm thinking back to just a couple short weeks ago where Republicans were telling me that they were nervous that the Cavanaugh nomination would be problematic for the midterms for women just because of how much abortion would be talked about that was he before the sexual misconduct claims that's before the way many Republicans have responded to those claims and so we are seeing some numbers that that clearly has turned off some women have real it has really caused some concern in these races where Republicans are trying to stave off any sort of blue wave ripple whatever size it might be it's proven problematic and that's one thing that Republicans are gonna have to try too one reason why they're trying to gin up their most ardent base to get them out to vote but they're gonna have to deal with this somehow in the four weeks a little less than four weeks we have left before voters go to the polls hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos
