good eye on Mark Latham and today I'm looking at domestic violence propaganda in Australia now you've got to hand it to the left-wing mainstream media sometimes I mean they've got an amazing ability to take a government report that says one thing and turn it into a headline that says something totally different on Wednesday we had the release by the Australian Bureau of Statistics of their personal safety survey and here's the headline here's the headline presented by the ABS their survey shows a decline in rates of violence in Australia so it's a good news story rates of violence they're coming down something that would be welcomed in any Western nation now of course how is it portrayed in the left-wing Fairfax press half of women face sexual assault so they've got their narratives the left-wing narrative is all about the epidemic the epidemic of sexual harassment and domestic violence in Australia and other countries typical of this narrative let's listen to Wally dolly on the project they were regularly beaten abused and killed by Australian men usually their partners so really he's saying that Australian women are regularly beaten abused and killed well I don't know what circles while he dolly mixes in but he should have a good look at the ABS report because it shows no such thing the data shows a totally different world to the one that I Lee talks about the figures were encouraging that the overall rate of violence in Australia had dropped from 8.3 percent in 2005 to 5.4 percent for women physical violence was down from 4.7 percent to 3.5 for men almost half from 10 the 5.4 percent in the preceding 12-month period and that's the rates over a decade now of course there's even a statistical trick in this the the establishment the political elites they're always trying to redefine our lives for us you've got to understand in this ABS report violence itself is defined to include threats of violence so it goes beyond physical contact between two people and commonly in society you think violence is contact between two people of an aggressive kind well the definition includes threats of violence things that might have been said perhaps in the heat of the moment never acted on so Australia even according to these statistics is far less violent than what they presented here because it includes threats something that your average person wouldn't include as an act of aggressive physical contact now of course the narrative that Holly goes on about domestic violence it's everywhere you've got the left feminists trying to demonize men talking about an epidemic of domestic violence in Australia they want to demonize the men they've got the mythical campaign of our gender inequality they've got all sorts of loopy reasons for why they think domestic violence is happening let's have a look at what the report actually says from Wednesday at the ABS it says the proportion of women who experience partner violence in the previous 12 months has remained relatively stable over the past decade so even with that very very broad unrealistic definition of violence it's been stable over a decade and under two percent under two percent of women affected by partner violence so there is no epidemic there is no need to be demonizing every Australian man and you need to be realistic about the causes of domestic violence now of course we know about the hashtag me to campaign they love a hashtag the lefties the me to campaign well it's brought out in the last couple of days in Australia a research report by someone called Alison croghan here's the report you can see it here Alison croghan and when we get into the guts of it she's got no one who goes on the record with a specific incident of course she hasn't and all she's got is that the former called kandi Bowers who she quotes as an authority what are the causes of sexual harassment and violence against women well here's the list look at this quote colonisation white supremacy patriarchal supremacy of course patriarchal supremacy you're going to let BS in there mansplaining and white splaining really has she ever been to a remote indigenous community in Australia she ever spoken an indigenous woman as I did earlier in the week to hear about the reality of domestic violence in indigenous communities a real real problem you want to talk at a local level a genuine epidemic problem because their statistics clearly show when you look at the mapping data out of New South Wales produced by the the crime Bureau there the statistics clearly show that for every one incident of domestic violence you know middle-class suburb there are ten in a public housing estate and there are 25 in a remote indigenous community so that's the reality good nothing to do with white supremacy it's got nothing to do with these left-wing theories about patriarchy it's got nothing to do with the demonization of all Australian men there is a concentrated problem it goes to men we've got problems in their lives lack of self-esteem poverty substance abuse all sorts of issues and problems in their lives are now going to take individual responsibility to clear any violence they use the violence as I'm a cop coping mechanism try and get some control over people but it's a problem that's isolated generally on the grounds of socioeconomic status and disadvantage so that's the truth of it well the lefties they work overtime with their propaganda it's amazing how they could government reports that say one thing you know something totally different in the public arena I thought I'd clear up those facts for you today I'm Mark Latham for revel Australia so if you like that video please share it with all your family and friends on social media and don't forget
