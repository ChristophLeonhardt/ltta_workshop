1
00:00:00,376 --> 00:00:01,810
BRIAN: BRIDGE TOLLS SUSPENDED.

2
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:03,478
PEOPLE ARE RACING TO GET OUT OF

3
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:03,778
TOWN.

4
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,346
JANICE DEAN IS FOLLOWING

5
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:06,447
MICHAEL'S TRACK.

6
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:08,616
EVERYONE IN TALLAHASSEE,

7
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:10,718
HIGHWAYS WERE PACKED YESTERDAY.

8
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,987
>> UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T HAVE

9
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,689
A LOT OF LEAD-UP TIME.

10
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,959
NOW IS THE TIME TO PAY CRUCIAL

11
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,828
ATTENTION TO THE LOCAL FORECASTS

12
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:20,862
AND OFFICIALS.

13
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:22,397
WE'LL SEE LANDFALL OF THIS

14
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:24,098
HURRICANE, PROBABLY A MAJOR

15
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:25,500
HURRICANE TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

16
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,835
LOOKING MORE LIKE TOMORROW

17
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:27,168
EVENING.

18
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:29,637
THE EXACT TIMING STILL TO BE

19
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:30,071
DETERMINED.

20
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,472
WE'RE EXPECTING A STRENGTHENING

21
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:33,374
STORM AS IT MAKES LANDFALL.

22
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,776
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STORM

23
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:37,745
BRINGS THE WORST OF THE STORM

24
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,148
SURGE, WORST OF WINDS, WORST OF

25
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:40,515
THE RAIN.

26
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:42,717
THAT ISN'T SAYING WEST SIDE OF

27
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,719
THE STORM WILL NOT FEEL EFFECTS.

28
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,455
WE HAVE INLAND PARTS AS FAR AS

29
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:48,823
NORTH AS SOUTH CAROLINA.

30
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:50,959
HERE IS THE LATEST TRACK, MAKING

31
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,160
LANDFALL WE THINK SOMETIME IN

32
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:53,261
THE AFTERNOON TOWARDS THE

33
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,096
EVENING HOURS, PANHANDLE OF

34
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,098
FLORIDA.

35
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,367
UP TOWARDS GEORGIA AND THE

36
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:00,368
CAROLINAS, STILL AS TROPICAL

37
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,069
STORM.

38
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,638
AREAS INUNDATED BY RAINFALL WITH

39
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,907
FLORENCE WILL GET MORE RAINFALL.

40
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:07,609
THE REASON WE THINK IT WILL

41
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,177
STRENGTHEN THE WATER AHEAD OF IT

42
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:10,311
IS LIKE A HOT TUB.

43
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:12,580
A LOT OF WARM WATER AHEAD OF IT.

44
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,282
NOTHING REALLY TO TEAR IT APART.

45
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,851
IT WILL REMAIN INTACT AND

46
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:17,252
STRENGTHEN.

47
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:19,988
A MAJOR HURRICANE NOT HIT THIS

48
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:21,656
AREA OF FLORIDA OVER A DECADE.

49
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,958
IT WAS 2005.

50
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,228
FOLKS, YOU NEED TO TAKE ALL

51
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:27,629
PRECALLINGS.

52
00:01:27,630 --> 00:00:00,000
THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
