go ahead sure she's shocked that I picked her no like in a state of shock I'm not thinking that's okay I know you're not thinking you never do I'm sorry no go ahead go ahead in a tweet this weekend mr. president you said that it's incorrect to say you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation what does that have to do with straight I don't mind answering the question but you know I'd like to do the trade has to do with the other headline in the news which is the can no but I know but how about talking about trade and then we'll get to that we'll do that a little bit later you think excuse me do you have a question of trade well you one or two more questions okay don't do that that's not nice besides that somebody is before you excuse me don't do that do you have a question on trade you have a question on trade my question is okay please yes full an economy that is hot a stock market incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into judge Cavanaugh but your own statement on Friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is it well no I didn't say anything in Friday what I said is let the Senate decide whatever they want to do is okay with me and also the FBI I think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time just so we all understand this is our seventh investigation of a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma for a man that's never had any accusation any he's never had a bad statement about it means led I mean I think he was number one in his class at Yale he was number one in his law school at Yale and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks is incredible so I want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like they you know just starting I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation whatever that means according to the Senators and the Republicans the Republican majority I want them to do that I want it to be comprehensive I actually think it's a good thing for judge Cavanaugh I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly and the reason I'd like it to go quickly very simple it's so simple because it's unfair to him at this point what his wife is going through what his beautiful children are going through is not describable it's not describable it's not fair I think it's fair to do it to me because you know I've been going from day one I've been hurt from long before I got the office you've been doing it it's almost became I think for me it's like a part of my job description to handle this crap but as far as as far as this is a man that this is not from his world that potentially you are somewhat suppressing this economy I think the press has treated me unbelievably unfairly in fact when I won I said the good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse they're worse now than ever they're loco but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico I mean there are bad reports on everybody in here most of the people sitting down there been except for Mike Pence by the way Brett Kavanaugh fools is there a plan B so if he did lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull his I don't think he did I look yes here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay it's one of my only good traits I don't drink whatever they're looking for something good I said never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess I'd be would I be the WYD be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watched that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last 20 years have he had difficulty the last 20 years because nobody said anything bad about him in many many years dive in a bit more to the to your thoughts on Justin Trudeau mr. president you just said some senators are not angels and you've seen some of them and I would say some of them yes compromising situation yes could you tell us who and exactly what situation no no I think I'll save it for a book like everybody else and I'll write up okay I'm not giving it to you you
