PROMISES TO SURRENDER HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM IF PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISES NOT TO INVADE. THAT WAS PART OF WHAT WAS REVEILED. GENERAL JACK KEANE. JOHN BOLTON ANSWERED QUESTIONS. HE BELIEVES THE MEETING WILL HAPPEN. ONE OF THE QUIBBLES WHERE DOES IT HAPPEN. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THIS MEETING TAKES PLACE IF KIM GIVES UP HIS NICK LAR PROGRAM. I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING AT SINGAPORE. KIM JONG-UN DOESN'T LIKE TO TRAVEL. THEY'LL AGREE ON A PLACE AND TIME BECAUSE THESE TWO LEADERS WANT THIS TO TAKE PLACE. I THINK THE FRAMEWORK CERTAINLY FROM OUR POSITION IS VERY CLEAR. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO DISCUSS CERTAINLY. U.S. HOSTAGES. JAPANESE ABDUCTIES AND BALLISTIC MISSILES AND ONE CENTRAL ISSUE FOREMOST ON THE MIND OF THE UNITED STATES, COMPLETE VERIFIABLE DENUCLEARIZATION, THE CENTRAL ISSUE. WHAT KIM WILL LIKELY DO, DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. HE MAY WANT TO DRAG THIS OUT OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS FROM FREEZE TO DISARM, GET ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND THEN IF HE IS PLAYING US, THEN HE IS LIKELY TO HOLD ON TO SOME OF HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT THE END. WE WON'T BUY INTO THAT AND ACCEPT THAT. Bill: I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CLIP OF THE VIDEO FROM LAST FRIDAY THAT I FIND THE MOST INTRIGUING. HERE IS A MAN NOW SAUNTERING ACROSS THE BORDER, HE IS YOUNG. HE LOOKS ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE. HE CLEARLY HAS PERSONALITY AND HE HE IS ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE WITH WHO HE IS. I DON'T THINK THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN HIM LIKE THAT BEFORE, GENERAL. I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF MISINTERPRETATION ABOUT KIM JONG-UN, ONE, BECAUSE OF HIS YOUTH, TWO, BECAUSE OF HIS BELLICOSE NATURE AND OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT HE MADE RAINING DEATH ON AMERICA. THE CIA HAS THE BEST PROFILE ON HIM. THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.I.A., MR. POMPEO, MET WITH HIM AND I BELIEVE THE REASON WHY THERE IS OPTIMISM IN THE WHITE HOUSE NOT OVER THE CHARTS OPTIMISM. CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM IS THIS, BECAUSE I THINK AFTER POMPEO MET WITH HIM HE CAME BACK AND TOLD THE PRESIDENT LOOK AT, I THINK THIS GUY IS SERIOUS. HE UNDERSTANDS KIM JONG-UN BASED ON THE INTELLIGENCE C.I.A. ACT. HE BELIEVES THAT KIM JONG-UN IS A RATIONAL ACTOR AND BELIEVE HE IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE. AND THAT EVIDENCE IS NOT GOING TO BE THERE UNTIL WE ACTUALLY GET INTO THE MEETING. LOOK AT ALL THE STEPS HE IS TAKING TO CONVINCE US THAT THIS IS REAL. HAVING A MEETING WITH MR. MOON, THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA. THE DESIRE TO END THE WAR. JUST RECENTLY OVER THIS WEEKEND HE SAID LOOK AT, THE INSPECTORS CAN COME IN MAY AND LOOK AT MY CLOSED NUCLEAR TEST SITE IF THEY WANT TO. SO HE IS TRYING TO LAY ONE SHOE AFTER ANOTHER TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTANDS I'M SEAROUS. Bill: DOES THAT FACILITY IN THE NORTH EVEN WORK? I KNOW WHAT HE SAID BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'LL FIND WHEN THEY GET THERE. THE POINT YOU MAKE IS VERY IMPORTANT, I THINK FOR OUR VIEWERS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THAT ISN'T GOING TO LAST A MONTH, GENERAL. THIS WILL GO ON FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS, YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT, CORRECT? ABSOLUTELY. Bill: AS WE WATCH THAT PROCESS IS HE GIVEN A LITTLE IN ORDER TO FEED HIS PEOPLE AND GET THE TRADE SANCTIONS LIFTED A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME WHERE HE PRESERVES ULTIMATELY A PIECE, BE IT SMALL OR LARGE, OF HIS OWN NUCLEAR PROGRAM FOR HIMSELF AS A BARGAINING CHIP DOWN THE ROAD? OTHERWISE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT EVEN MAKES SENSE FOR A GUY WHO LIVED HIS LIFE TO BUILD THIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO SURRENDER IT AND GIVE IT UP. LAST WORD. THAT COULD BE HIS STRATEGY TO DRAG IT OUT AND GET SOMETHING BACK. THE UNITED STATES WON'T BUY THAT. WE'LL WANT TO GO QUICKLY, FREEZE, DISARM, DISMANTLE AND DO IT AT BEST OVER A YEAR AND A HALF AND TWO YEARS.
