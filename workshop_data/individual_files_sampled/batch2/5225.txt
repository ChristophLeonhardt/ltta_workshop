Jeff Bennett we now understand that Jim Jordan has just spoken out about his decision to launch an internal caucus campaign for Speaker of the House if the Republicans end up winning in the midterms let's play some of that Jim Jordan of course from the freedom caucus in the conservative why are you running for sega what's your message here you think there's some things that need to be changed and we got a letter that is going out to every single member as we speak and we'll get you a copy of that letter as well which lays out what what we think needs to happen but the main thing is we need to get refocused on what we said how could you think that OSU investigation the allegations could affect your run no everyone can see through that story I've talked to numerous some of my colleagues and they can all see through that Jeff as the door closes the question that was asked of Jim Jordan is there was there were allegations about impropriety by a coach and a doctor in Ohio State Ohio State wrestling I believe he was a deputy at the time he said he had no knowledge of it never saw anything about so he's firmly denied that but this is some people would say a cloud hanging over it but in any case he is challenging Cheerilee Kevin McCarthy would be the anointed successor perhaps Steve Scalise yeah well that's right and look Jim Jordan denies any wrongdoing in that OSU wrestling case but the controversy the scandal has not abated that said as you rightly point out this has largely been seen as a race for Kevin McCarthy the House Majority Leader to lose and so when those impeachment articles were introduced last night there was a question about what really is the underlying motivation here is is this also a way for Jim Jordan to turn the page from the scandal that he's been dealing with or could it be a review to a speaker run when out appears that that he also is gonna throw his hat in the ring as we've just reported so we hope to get to talk to him some more about that and of course bring you those details as we know the manager hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
