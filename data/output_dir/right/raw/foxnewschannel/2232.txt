1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:04,880
TO GET MY BILL AND LET THE BILL

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,214
PASSED.

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,883
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:08,550
THERE WAS OTHER NEWS TODAY

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,887
CONCERNING OUR PRESIDENT.

6
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,689
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GO INTO

7
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,090
EFFECT IN THE ALUMINUM AND

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,159
MAKING COUNTRIES, NOT ONLY

9
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:20,462
INCLUDING CHINA BUT A HOST OF

10
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:21,297
OUR OTHER FRIENDS.

11
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:22,998
WE SCALED THAT BACK AND GAVE A

12
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:25,100
30 DAY EXTENSION TO THE LIKES OF

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,570
THE E.U., CANADA, MEXICO, AND

14
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:28,904
BRAZIL.

15
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,941
SOUTH KOREA HAD ALREADY'S

16
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:33,909
SEPARATED FOR ANOTHER AGREEMENT.

17
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,178
THAT HAS HELD OFF FOR 30 DAYS,

18
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:37,146
AND A REMINDER TO SOME THAT THE

19
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:41,684
PRESIDENT IS ALSO IMPROVING A

20
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:42,284
PRAGMATIC OR NEGOTIATING

21
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:44,953
STRATEGY HERE THAT COULD EVEN

22
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:47,089
GET CONCESSIONS OUT OF THE

23
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,891
CHINESE.

24
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,092
REBECCA HEINEMAN FROM THE HUDSON

25
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,094
INSTITUTE IS WITH US.

26
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,329
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

27
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,398
>> OF THE PRESIDENT IS BEING

28
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:57,099
EQUITABLY DOMINIC INCREDIBLY

29
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:57,466
PRAGMATIC.

30
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:59,134
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN START

31
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:02,104
STARVED OF THIS KIND OF

32
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,305
LEADERSHIP.

33
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:05,507
ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE ALL

34
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:07,309
AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO

35
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:08,877
RECALIBRATE THEIR TRADE

36
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:09,511
POLICIES, AND TO BE MORE

37
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:11,714
FAVORABLE TO THE UNITED STATES

38
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:15,084
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE E.U.,

39
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:16,518
MEXICO AND CANADA.

40
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:17,553
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS WILL

41
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:18,087
CONTINUE.

42
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:19,488
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THIS IS

43
00:01:19,488 --> 00:01:21,290
THE LAST TIME THE UNITED STATES

44
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,091
IS EXTENDING THIS.

45
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:23,492
WE WANT THEM TO MAKE CONCESSIONS

46
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:25,961
SO THE UNITED STATES HAS A

47
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:26,428
BETTER POSITION.

48
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:29,331
>> WHEN WE GO TO THE CHINESE, WE

49
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:32,167
ARE SENDING OUR AVENGERS, IN THE

50
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,303
ECONOMIC TEAM, IT SEEMS TO ME.

51
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,372
I LOOK AT THE NAMES OF WHO IS

52
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:38,340
GOING TO CHINA, THEY ARE ALL

53
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,576
GOING THERE AND THE PRESIDENT IS

54
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:45,114
EAGER FOR THEM TO GET THE WORD

55
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:46,081
OUT.

56
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,349
WE NEED TARIFFS THAT THE CHINESE

57
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:50,018
WON'T BEND.

58
00:01:50,018 --> 00:01:54,890
AND THEY WON'T BEND WITH THE

59
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,557
NUMBER TURNING OUR SURPLUS.

60
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:57,493
NOR ARE THEY GOING TO GET MUCH

61
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,694
GROUND ON HIGH TECHNOLOGY

62
00:01:58,694 --> 00:01:59,361
CONCESSIONS OR ARTIFICIAL

63
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:03,499
INTELLIGENCE OR ANY OF THAT.

64
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,101
SO I'M WONDERING IF EVERYONE IS

65
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:07,102
GETTING LOCKED IN THEIR

66
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:07,569
POSITIONS HERE?

67
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:13,909
>> THIS IS ONLY THE TRUE-THE

68
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,544
REALLY THE ONLY TRADE ISSUE TO,

69
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:16,912
AND THAT IS CHINA'S HELP WITH

70
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:17,813
NORTH KOREA SO THAT'S ANOTHER

71
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:21,483
ANGLE HERE THAT WE HAVE TO

72
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:22,351
CONSIDER, MORE THAN ANYTHING.

73
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,852
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DETERMINED TO

74
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,121
GET CHINA TO NOT PROVIDE

75
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:28,490
DIPLOMATIC COVER FOR NORTH KOREA

76
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,692
BUT INSTEAD, SIDE WITH THE

77
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,693
UNITED STATES.

78
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,095
THE CHINESE MIGHT BE PLAYING

79
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,696
HARDBALL ON TRADE BECAUSE THEY

80
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,631
KNOW THAT ACTUALLY THE ALLIGATOR

81
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:38,400
CLOSEST TO THE BOAT IS HELPING

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,868
WITH THAT NEGOTIATION TO THE

83
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,302
NORTH KOREANS.

84
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:42,871
>> SO DOES THAT MEAN PRESIDENT

85
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,409
MIGHT BE MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE OR

86
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:54,116
AMENABLE, ON THIS NORTH KOREA

87
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:54,416
THING?

88
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,751
>> IF THAT'S THE CASE, CERTAINLY

89
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:58,220
THAT'S NOT THE POSITION THAT THE

90
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,527
ADMINISTRATION WILL GO IN WITH.

91
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,897
AND I CERTAINLY KNOW THIS IS A

92
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,098
PRIORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT, BUT

93
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:11,700
IF THERE IS AN AREA WHERE THE

94
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,101
PRESIDENT MIGHT GIVE A LITTLE

95
00:03:13,101 --> 00:00:00,000
BIT, IT WILL BE WITH CHINA AND I
