before a meeting with military advisers over Syria and angry president Donald Trump blasted a new federal investigation into personal attorney Michael Cohen it's a disgraceful situation it's a total witch hunt I've been saying it for a long time I've wanted to keep it down we've given I believe over a million pages worth of documents to the Special Counsel the investigation into Cohen stems from special prosecutor Robert mullahs probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election Moeller apparently found information about Cohen that he turned over to federal prosecutors Cohen has been under scrutiny for admitting that he paid adult film star stormy Daniels one hundred thirty thousand dollars less than two weeks before the election Daniel's claims the payment was hush money over an affair with the president Trump denies the affair and any knowledge of the payment but a former federal prosecutor says the documents confiscated in Monday's raid could show a connection between the president and the porn star it is very unusual for a lawyer to have his office served a search warrant by the FBI and that means there it happens when there's something called the crime fraud exception so there is obviously a belief by somebody who's looked at the evidence that mr. Cohen and his client mr. Trump may have been involved in some kind of criminal activity Cohen's attorney says his client is cooperating with investigators but said the decision by the US Attorney's Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary it resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney-client communications between a lawyer and his clients the new investigation could put President Trump on a collision course again with special prosecutor Robert Muller who he threatened to fire last summer and who he now says has stepped over a line Dianne Esterbrook al Jazeera Washington
