1
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,150
it was a typically boring hearing

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,970
yesterday on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Capitol Hill until two</font>

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,029
congressmen assaulted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim Geithner one</font>

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,949
saying he has lost the<font color="#E5E5E5"> support of the</font>

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,930
American public<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other saying he</font>

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,359
should resign why were they saying this

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,420
why is the Geithner hate reaching a peak

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,020
now a full year after he reamed the US

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,940
taxpayers to save his buddies on Wall

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Street well because a year ago the whole</font>

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,710
world looked like it was ending so

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,120
nobody wanted to focus on the details

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,390
but now the world has ended for Main

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,140
Street ten percent unemployment worse 30

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,289
years meanwhile on Wall Street<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

16
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,480
best ever so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have that</font>

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">dichotomy you can't is the answer</font>

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,350
Americans are mad as hell and Congress

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,910
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take it anymore and</font>

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,399
they're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> out on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secretary tim so</font>

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,530
what's the prognosis<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Treasury</font>

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,689
secretary well as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have a</font>

23
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,060
Geithner to Goldman clock that is

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,580
tracking the hours minutes and seconds

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,409
until Tim Geithner takes his rightful

26
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,450
place of Goldman Sachs<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're projecting</font>

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,850
it that'll be in 2012 or so we actually

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,710
now think mr. Geiser will be leaving

29
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,380
office earlier who would stay in that

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,330
job having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen to annoying</font>

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,890
congressman bitch at you all day

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,420
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're making chicken</font>

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">feed public servant wages and you have a</font>

34
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,970
house to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell and family to feed why not</font>

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,340
go take a nice seat on Wall Street<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,380
the complicating factor is that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

37
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,780
the anger is so high at both Tim

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,820
Geithner and at Goldman Sachs that it

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,680
would be almost impossible we think for

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">him to jump directly to Goldman Sachs so</font>

41
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,729
we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when he does leave he</font>

42
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,110
will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a private equity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> firm and</font>

43
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,670
twiddle his thumbs for a little while

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,439
before he takes that Goldman job which

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,840
we still think we'll be in 2012 does

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,030
Geithner deserve all the hate that he's

47
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,649
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now and the crap he's</font>

48
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,040
getting in these public beatings yes in

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,020
a way we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in fact he escaped</font>

50
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,929
unscathed last fall with the AIG bailout

51
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,760
and other things and people have more

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,060
thing

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,830
is more important things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on and</font>

54
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,230
now everyone is<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally realizing just</font>

55
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,020
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a gift was given to some</font>

56
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,819
shareholders and some companies at the

57
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">expense of taxpayers how it could have</font>

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,569
been handled better so we do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

59
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tim Geithner bears some responsibility</font>

60
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,620
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but the</font>

61
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,660
frustration<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is coming to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 is</font>

62
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,730
definitely justified and we will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

63
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,190
curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how long Tim with stands</font>

64
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,840
it he certainly survived a brush with

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,060
death after first being appointed to

66
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,250
office perhaps this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will blow over as</font>

67
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">well but we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Geithner to</font>

68
00:02:43,380 --> 00:00:00,000
Goldman clock set for 2012
