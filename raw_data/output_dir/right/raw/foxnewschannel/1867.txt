13
00:00:45,126 --> 00:00:45,459
RESPECT.

14
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,329
WE DIDN'T PAY FOR THEM.

WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE

21
00:00:57,772 --> 00:01:00,274
PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT IN ELKHART,

22
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:01,342
INDIANA, TALKING A LITTLE BIT

23
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:04,211
ABOUT GETTING THOSE THREE GUYS

24
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:04,545
SPRUNG?

25
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:08,182
>> FIRST OF ALL GOOD MORNING TO

26
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:08,549
EVERYBODY.

27
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,785
STEVE, AINSLEY, PETE, GOOD TO

28
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:11,619
SEE YOU.

29
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:13,120
I'M A LITTLE HOARSE.

30
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,822
I'VE BEEN READING AUDIO VERSION

31
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:16,824
OF MY BOOK LAST FOUR DAYS, IF I

32
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,359
SOUND A LITTLE FROGGY.

33
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,127
FIRST OF ALL LET'S GET TO THE

34
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:20,427
POINT.

35
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:22,463
I THINK THE PRESIDENT ALREADY

36
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:24,298
ATTAINED A TREMENDOUS TRIUMPH.

37
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:25,499
THE RELEASE OF THE THREE

38
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:27,935
PRISONERS THE OTHER NIGHT WAS AN

39
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:30,871
INSPIRING, THE OTHER MORNING, AN

40
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,772
INSPIRING SIGHT.

41
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:32,540
IT WAS GREAT.

42
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,774
I THINK THIS OPENING TO

43
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:39,647
NORTH KOREA IS ON A PAR WITH

44
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:40,447
SADDAT-BEGIN 1978.

45
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:41,182
STEVE: WOW.

46
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:43,117
>> CAMP DAVID, ACCORDS THERE.

00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,391
1973, OPENING UP NORMALIZED

49
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:50,758
RELATIONS.

50
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:53,093
THIS IS POTENTIAL FOR SOMETHING

51
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,196
VAST AND INCREDIBLE, UNTHINKABLE

52
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:55,763
MONTHS AGO.

53
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:57,498
GETTING TO THE SPEECH IN INDIANA

54
00:01:57,498 --> 00:01:59,633
LAST NIGHT AND PRESIDENT KIND OF

55
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:00,968
DIGGING HIS PREDECESSOR,

56
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:03,771
PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR MAKING THE

57
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,307
$1.6 BILLION, YOU KNOW, IN SOME

58
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:08,074
WAYS THE SWEETENER FOR THAT DEAL

59
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,311
WAS TO GET OUR FOUR AMERICAN

60
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:12,313
HOSTAGES OUT OF IRAN, SO THERE

61
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:16,183
WAS A MONEY COMPONENT TO

62
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:17,785
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EFFORTS AND

63
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,854
SUCCESS IN LIBERATING THE FOUR

64
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,856
AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN IRAN.

65
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,924
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MONEY WAS

66
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:25,459
A FACTOR, BUT FOR THE PRESIDENT,

67
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,061
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BRING IT

68
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:30,397
UP AND KIND OF RUB IT INTO THE

69
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:31,632
44th PRESIDENT, I THINK THAT

70
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:36,070
IS KIND OF PETTY STUFF THAT I

71
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,571
SOMETIMES I SHUDDER WHEN I HEAR

72
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,640
MY FRIEND THE PRESIDENT --

73
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,410
STEVE: BUT GERALDO, THE CROWD

74
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,044
WENT WILD.

75
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:46,113
>> BUT THAT IS, THAT IS IN A

76
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:47,147
PARTISAN CONTEXT.

77
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:49,550
I HAVE NO, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

78
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:49,950
RIGHT.

79
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,719
IT IS RED MEAT FOR THE, YOU KNOW

80
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,787
FOR THE PARTISAN, FOR THE TRUE

81
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:55,823
BELIEVERS, BUT THIS, WHAT IS

82
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:57,091
GOING ON WITH NORTH KOREA IS NOT

83
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,359
A REPUBLICAN THING.

84
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,928
IT IS NOT EVEN A TRUMPIAN THING.

85
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:03,998
IT IS AN AMERICAN THING.

86
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:05,699
THE UNITED STATES NOW STANDS ON

87
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,003
THE VERGE OF HELPING SUPERVISE

88
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:10,604
THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

89
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:11,672
KOREAN PENINSULA.

90
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,340
SOMETHING UNTHOUGHT OF,

91
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,108
UNTHINKABLE UNTIL RECENTLY.

92
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:15,542
I THINK THE PRESIDENT, WHO WILL

93
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,545
BE, I THINK, SHOO-IN FOR THE

94
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,414
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, SHOULD TAKE

95
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:22,283
THE HIGH ROAD AND, YOU KNOW,

96
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:23,851
FORGET ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

97
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:25,252
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID WHEN THEY

98
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:26,053
WERE IN CHARGE.

99
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,388
HE IS IN CHARGE NOW.

100
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:28,756
HE IS THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL

101
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:29,123
AMERICANS.

102
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:31,392
SO LET'S JUST GO FORWARD,

103
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:32,359
EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE.

104
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,360
THAT IS ALL I'M SAYING.

105
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,595
PETE: IT IS AN AMERICAN THING,

106
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:37,464
BUT IT IS IN ONE SENSE, GERALDO,

107
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:39,767
THE TRUMPIAN THING, UNDER THE

108
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:40,768
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WE

109
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:43,570
TRADED FIVE OF THE WORST FOR A

110
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,738
TRAITOR IN BOWE BERGDAHL.

111
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:45,706
THERE WAS UNDERSTANDING YOU HAVE

112
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:47,908
TO GIVE UP A LOT IN ORDER TO GET

113
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:49,543
SOMETHING BUT ISN'T PRESIDENT

114
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,812
TRUMP TAKING A STRONGER STANCE

115
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:53,647
AND AS A RESULT GETTING MORE FOR

116
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:53,948
LESS?

117
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:55,783
>> I THINK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

118
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:56,884
HAPPENED IN KIM'S HEAD.

119
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:59,320
I WAS UTTERLY SHOCKED, MAJOR,

120
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,088
WHEN I SAW THIS OPENING

121
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:02,189
HAPPENING, WHEN IT REALLY SEEMED

122
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:04,525
THAT IT WAS MORE THAN JUST TALK.

123
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:07,628
WHEN KIM REALLY WALKED INTO

124
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:08,429
SOUTH KOREA AND THEY'RE

125
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:10,197
LISTENING TO POP MUSIC AND I

126
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:11,899
SAID, MY GOD, THIS IS THE GUY

127
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:14,802
WHO RUNS THE HERMIT KINGDOM.

128
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:16,536
THIS IS THE BOGEYMAN OF THE

129
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:17,404
WORLD.

130
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:23,310
THIS IS THE MAN NUCLEAR

131
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,245
TECHNOLOGY IS THREATENING THE

132
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,181
REGION, JAPAN, SO FORTH BUT THE

133
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:28,415
WEST COAST OF NIGHT.

134
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:29,984
SUDDENLY HE IS SAYING TAKE THE

135
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:30,284
NUKES.

136
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:32,586
LET'S HAVE NORMAL RELATIONS.

137
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,188
HE IS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT

138
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:35,856
MOON OF NORTH KOREA.

139
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:37,624
TALKING ABOUT INTEGRATING THE

140
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:38,993
ECONOMIES OF THE TWO KOREAS.

141
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,028
THIS IS UTTER ITLY STEW PEN

142
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:46,200
DOES, THIS IS SENSATIONAL.

143
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,468
THE PRESIDENT'S TACK TEX AND

144
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:50,471
STRATEGY IS CLEARLY WORKING.

145
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,106
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE

146
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,674
SUCCESS WITH THE SAME GRACE THAT

147
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:55,509
YOU TAKE A SETBACK, PETE.

148
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:57,544
AINSLEY: GERALDO, WE'VE BEEN

149
00:04:57,544 --> 00:04:59,013
WATCHING GINA HASPEL BEING

150
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:00,481
GRILLED IN FRONT OF THE SENATE

151
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:03,150
FOR THE INTERROGATION PROCESS

152
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,085
WORKING FOR CIA RIGHT AFTER

153
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:05,386
9/11.

154
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:06,487
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN QUOTED,

155
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,088
THERE WAS VIDEO PLAYED YESTERDAY

156
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:09,757
ON "THE VIEW" OF HIM SAYING HE

157
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:12,893
HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THOSE THREE

158
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,595
TERRORISTS BEING WATERBOARDED SO

159
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:17,164
THAT WE COULD GET INFORMATION

160
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:19,299
THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO

161
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:19,666
BIN LADEN.

162
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,535
WHOOPIE GOLD PER WAS COMMENTING

163
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,436
ON IT YESTERDAY.

164
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:24,438
SHE SAID SHE WANTS OUR PRESIDENT

165
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:26,807
TO TRY WATERBOARDING OR GET

166
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:27,241
WATERBOARDED.

167
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:27,708
LISTEN TO THIS.

168
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,209
>> REMEMBER HOW THE GENTLEMAN IN

169
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,110
THE WHITE HOUSE TALKED ABOUT

170
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,645
TORTURE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?

171
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:32,980
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I WOULD

172
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,581
LIKE YOU TO TRY IT.

173
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,316
I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY

174
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:37,785
BEEN TORTURED, WHO ARE SAYING

175
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:39,686
THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING, YOU

176
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,088
SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM, BECAUSE

177
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:44,191
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TORTURED AND

178
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:46,026
NEITHER HAS DICK CHENEY.

179
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:47,494
AINSLEY: WHAT IS YOUR REACTION.

180
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,196
>> MY REACTION, FIRST OF ALL,

181
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:52,466
THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE, GINA

182
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,534
HASPEL SHOULD BE CONFIRMED AS

183
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:56,170
HEAD OF THE CIA SHE WOULD MAKE A

184
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,671
TERRIFIC DIRECTOR OF THE CIA.

185
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,773
SHE WILL BE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA,

186
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:00,974
NOT THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA.

187
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,810
THIS IS A TOUGH WORLD.

188
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,413
YOU KNOW INTELLIGENCE AND, YOU

189
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,382
KNOW, THE WHOLE CLANDESTINE SIDE

190
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,517
OF OUR CONFLICT WITH OUR ENEMIES

191
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,519
IS SOMETIMES BRUTAL BUSINESS.

192
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,655
WHAT HAPPENED WITH WATERBOARDING

193
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:17,091
AND THE TORTURE IN RETROSPECT

194
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,492
MAY SEEM REGRETTABLE BUT THERE

195
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:21,161
IS NO DENYING THAT IT DID LEAD

196
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:22,696
TO THE COURIER, THAT LED US TO

197
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:24,765
THE TERROR MASTERMIND WHO

198
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:27,101
INFLICTED SO MUCH PAIN AND

199
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:31,038
SUFFERING ON THE UNITED STATES.

200
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,172
WHOOPIE FOR DECADES.

201
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:33,540
FOR HER EVEN TO SUGGEST THAT THE

202
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,542
PRESIDENT ENDURE THAT, THAT IS

203
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,611
DISRESPECTFUL AND UNNECESSARY.

204
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:39,813
YES, WE GET IT WAS BRUTAL.

205
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,815
YES WE GET THAT UNITED STATES

206
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:44,051
NOW HAS A FIRM WHAT SENATOR JOHN

207
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:45,486
McCAIN HAS WANTED, THAT WE

208
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:46,720
WON'T TORTURE.

209
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,788
THAT WATERBOARDING IS TORTURE.

210
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:49,990
WE GET IT, BUT THERE IS NO

211
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,692
DENYING, AND I THINK THAT THIS

212
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:53,460
GIVES PEOPLE THE CREEPS, BUT

213
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,129
THERE IS NO DENYING WHAT

214
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,463
HAPPENED WITH KHALID SHEIKH

215
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:59,600
MOHAMMED AND THE OTHERS, THE

216
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,502
OTHER TWO WHO WERE WATERBOARDED

217
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:03,237
DID HAVE SOME SUCCESS WITHOUT

218
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:05,506
WHICH WE MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN

219
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:06,740
BIN LADEN AS SOON AS WE DID.

220
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,376
AS IT WAS, IT TOOK ALMOST 10

221
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:09,910
YEARS.
