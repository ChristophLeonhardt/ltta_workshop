IT IS A -- TERM LIMITED.
IT IS A FIERCE FIGHT.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIGHT FOR
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
THE FRONTRUNNERS, DENNIS
KUCINICH WHO IS BACKED BY BARRY
SANDERS AND HIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY
AND RICHARD CORDRAY HAS THE
ENDORSEMENT OF SENATOR ELIZABETH
WARREN.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
WE APPRECIATE BEING WITH --
APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.
DOES THIS REPRESENT THE SPLIT IN
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BETWEEN
BARRY SANDERS AND THE ELIZABETH
WARREN WING?
>> I DON'T THINK IT REPRESENTS A
REAL SPLIT IF
REAL SPLIT IN THE PARTY.
BETTERY SANDERS HAS NOT SHALL --
BETTER NISSAN DEERS HAS NOT --
BERNIE SANDERS HAS NOT MADE AN
ENDORSEMENT IN THIS CASE.
HE SAID HE'S NOT ENDORSING IN
OHIO THIS YEAR.
WAS WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE
PRESENTING A CASE TO THE VOTERS
OF OHIO.
IN OUR CASE, BETTY SUTTON AND I
ARE RUNNING ON THE KITCHEN TABLE
ISSUES THAT PEOPLE TALK TO US
ABOUT ALL OVER THE STATE, THINGS
THAT WORRY THEM WHEN LOOKING OUT
FOR THEIR FAMILIES, INCLUDING
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, BETTER
EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN,
AND SPREADING OUT ECONOMIC
OPPORTUNITY ACROSS THE STATE SO
NOBODY IS LEFT OUT OR LEFT
BEHIND.
>> LELAND: WHERE DO YOU HAVE TO
BE WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP WON BY
8 POINTS TO WIN BACK THE
GOVERNOR'S MANSION.
YOU HAVE AN "A" RATING FROM THE
ARA.
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'RE TRYING
IN A PRIMARY TO GO AFTER VOTERS
WHO ARE FAR LEFT OF AN "A"
RATING FROM THE NRA ON THE
ISSUES.
>> WHAT I TRY TO DO IN A
CAMPAIGN IS TALK ABOUT WHAT I
WOULD DO IN THE OFFICE AND MAKE
PROMISES THAT I CAN KEEP AND
PROMISES THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT
MAKING SURE WE DELIVER ON.
IN OUR CASE, IT IS FOCUSING ON
THOSE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES AND
LETTING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND --
>> LELAND: WHAT ARE KITCHEN
TABLE ISSUES.
WHAT CAN YOU DELIVER ON THAT
NEEDS CHANGE?
>> THESE ARE THE ECONOMIC ISSUES
THAT DOMINATE PEOPLE'S LIVES.
>> LELAND: PEOPLE TELL ME THE
ECONOMY IN OHIO IS BOOMING.
YOU GO TO COLUMBUS WHERE YOU'RE
FROM AND THERE IS CONSTRUCTION
EVERYWHERE.
>> PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT
THEIR HEALTH CARE.
THERE'S A CIRCUS GOING ON IN
WASHINGTON AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HEALTH CARE.
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT BEING
DIAGNOSED WITH A CONDITION
TOMORROW AND DO THEY HAVE ACCESS
TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR
THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING,
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT'S THE
KEY TO THE FUTURE.
WE HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM IN
OHIO WHERE A FOR PROFIT CHARTER
SCHOOL EXPERIMENT HAS DEVASTATED
MANY OF THE SCHOOLS, TAKING TONS
OF MONEY PUTTING IT INTO
FLAILING ONLINE SCHOOLS.
>> LELAND: LET'S GET TO THE
POLITICS OF THIS RACE.
DENNIS KUCINICH, THE FORMER
MAYOR OF CLEVELAND, IS RUNNING
AGAINST YOU.
HE HAS HAD TIME INSIDE POLITICS,
TIME OUTSIDE POLITICS.
HE WAS ON SHANNON BREAM'S SHOW
LAST NIGHT.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> ONE OF THE MAIN CRITICISMS
THEY HAVE OF YOU, IS YOU SPENT
SO MUCH TIME HERE WITH US ON FOX
NEWS.
HERE'S RICHARD CORDRAY TALKING
ABOUT THAT.
>> HE KNOWS THE GAME THEY'RE
PLAYING.
HE GOES ON TO SAY THEY WERE FAIR
AND BALANCED.
HE TOOK THEIR MONEY AND MADE
THEIR CHOICES.
>> HOUSE POODLE, YOUR RESPONSE?
>> ARRRR.
>> LELAND: YOUR RESPONSE TO THE
RESPONSE?
>> LOOK, I THINK I STATED IT FOR
WHAT IT WAS.
EVERYBODY MAKES CHOICES IN LIFE.
WHEN I WAS STANDING UP FOR
CONSUMERS AND FIGHTING TO SEE
THEY'RE TREATED FAIRLY, HE WAS A
PAID COMMENTER ON FOX NEWS.
>> LELAND: YOU'RE ON FOX NEWS
RIGHT NOW.
WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.
IS SOMEBODY GIVING THEIR OPINION
AND DEFENDING THEIR IDEALS WHICH
HE DID MANY TIMES ON OUR SHOW,
IS THAT SOMETHING TO KNOCK HIM
FOR?
I'M NOT CLEAR WHAT THE ATTACK
IS.
>> HE SAID ONE THING ON FOX NEWS
AND SAID DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE
CAMPAIGN.
>> LELAND: WHAT SPECIFICALLY --
WHAT DID HE SAY EITHER ON FOX
NEWS OR OTHER PLACE THAT'S YOU
HAVE ISSUES WITH THAT YOU FEEL
HE'S BEEN DISINGENUOUS ABOUT
NOW.
>> HE PRAISED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
INAUGURAL SPEECH AND SCRUBBED
HIS TWITTER FEED.
HE GAVE SPEECHES TO CPAC'S
CONFERENCE.
HE'S TRYING TO ON LIT RATE
HE'S TRYING TO OBJLIT RATE
HE'S TRYING TO OBJECT RATE
HE'S TRYING TO OBJECT BATE
HE'S TRYING TO OBJECT BLIE
HE'S TRYING TO OBJECT BLIGHT
RATE HIS -- OBLITERATE HIS PAST.
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE
SAY ONE THING IN ONE SETTING AND
ANOTHER THING IN ANOTHER
SETTING.
I THINK IT'S NOT A GOOD THING.
>> LELAND: THERE WAS A TIME
WHERE HIP CONSIDER SIGH WAS SEEN
AS A -- HIP POCK CRY
