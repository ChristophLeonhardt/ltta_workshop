RIGHTS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S NEED TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME. Martha: NOW, ANDREW McCARTHY, FORMER PROSECUTOR AND NATIONAL REVIEW CONTRIBUTING EDITOR. AND JUDITH MILLER, FORMER "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER. SHE SPENT 85 DAYS IN JAIL PROTECTING HER RIGHTS AS A MEMBER OF THE PRESS. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? EVERY REPORTER TRIES TO FIND SOURCES TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. AT THIS POINT WE DON'T, IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK? MARTHA, MY FRIENDS AND FORMER COLLEAGUES OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SAY THAT THIS WAS AN OUTRAGEOUS INVASION OF ALI WATKINS' PRIVACY. THAT THEY SEIZED HER METADATA. IT BASICALLY ERODES THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE PRESS AND ERIC HOLDER WHEN HE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT IS NOT SO. THAT THEY SCRUPULOUSLY FOLLOWED THE GUIDELINES AND THEY DID NOT INVADE HER PRIVACY AND GO AFTER HER METADAY FOR THE HECK OF IT. AND THERE WERE NATIONAL SECURITY GROUNDS FOR DOING SO. IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION WAS COMPROMISED. I OBVIOUSLY AS A MEMBER OF THE PRESS FEEL STRONGLY THAT SINCE ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS HAS THREATENED US AND THREATENED TO PUT MORE REPORTERS IN JAIL TO STOP LEAKS, ONE HAS TO BE SUSPICIOUS. IN MY CASE, NO NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION WAS COMPROMISED, THE F.B.I. AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WERE TRYING TO MAKE A POLITICAL CASE. BUT WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET. OR AT LEAST I DON'T TO DRAW A CONCLUSION IN THIS CASE. Martha: JUDITH TALK ABOUT THE METADATA MATERIAL, WHICH MEANT THEY WERE ABLE TO TRACK IF HER PHONE NUMBER WAS DISCUSSING ANYTHING WITH HIS PHONE NUMBER BUT NOT THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF WHAT WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH. SO THEY KNOW THEY WERE CONTACTING EACH OTHER. EXACTLY. Martha: ANDREW, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, YOU KNOW, AS CATHERINE SAID THESE ARE INTERESTS THAT HAVE TO BE BALANCED. THE GOVERNMENT HAS A VERY IMPORTANT INTEREST HERE. THE LEAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION HAS BEEN OUTRAGEOUS. GOING BACK TO BEFORE WHEN TRUMP WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO HAVE A FREE ROBUST PRESS. I THINK JUDITH'S CASE FOR EXAMPLE IS A CAUTIONARY TALE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A CASE THAT ISN'T MERITORIOUS ENOUGH TO USE THIS KIND OF EXTREME MEASURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS. ON THE OTHER HAND HAVING HAD OVER THE YEARS TO APPLY THE GUIDELINES YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BALANCING. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT, THE JOURNALIST IS NOT GIVEN A PRIVILEGE AT LEAST MUCH OF ONE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE NORMAL PERSON HAS IN TERMS OF PRIVACY. SO, I THINK YOU HAVE TO BALANCE IS THERE A VERY SERIOUS CASE? IS THE JOURNALISTS SOMEHOW IMPLICATED IN IT EITHER AS SOMEBODY WHO WITNESSED IT, SOMEBODY WHO PARTICIPATED IN IT, IS IT A SITUATION THAT ONLY THE JOURNALISTS HAS INFORMATION THAT THE PROSECUTOR NEEDS TO MAKE THIS SERIOUS CASE? IF YOU CAN'T CHECK ALL THOSE BOXES WE SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT THIS. Martha: A LOT OF THIS OBVIOUSLY GOES BACK TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE INFORMATION CAME OUT THAT LED TO THE INVESTIGATION. AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT. CARTER PAGE IS ONE OF THE STORIES THAT SHE WROTE ABOUT. YOU BELIEVE THERE IS AN ANTI-TRUMP BIAS COMING FROM MR. WOLFE, WHO WE SHOULD POINT OUT, JUDY, HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR DECADES. HE HAD A LOT OF ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AS HE BROUGHT IN WITNESSES. HE HAD A VERY HIGH LEVEL CLEARANCE IN ALL OF THIS. ABSOLUTELY. BUT HE IS NOT CHARGED WITH LEAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. Martha: NO. HE IS CHARGED WITH LYING TO THE F.B.I. SO IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS HERE ARE SUPPOSED BEING JEOPARDIZED. I THINK AS A JOURNALIST AND WE HAVE TO, WE ALL HAVE TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF THE GOVERNMENT MOTIVES. ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT AS THE GOVERNMENT POINTED OUT SHE WAS THE ONLY REPORTER WHOSE RECORDS WERE SEIZED. THE OTHER THREE REPORTERS THAT WASN'T THE CASE. Martha: IT MAY BE, ANDREW, AS THEY DIG INTO THIS, PERHAPS THERE WAS AN ISSUE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. WE JUST DON'T KNOW THAT YET. THEY WERE ABLE TO NAIL HIM DOWN WITH THE INTERACTIONS HE HAD WITH THE REPORTER. SHE CLAIMS HE NEVER RELEASED ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. WELL, I THINK MARTHA, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN CHARGED IN A STRATEGIC WAY BY CHARGING IT AS A THREE-COUNT FALSE STATEMENTS CASE THERE IS AT LEAST A CHANCE THAT THE PROSECUTORS WON'T HAVE TO MAKE DISCOVERY IN THE CASE OF WHAT THE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS. THE SKEPTICAL AMONG US WILL SAY IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE KEEPING UNDER WRAPS THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS CASE. HOPEFULLY WE'D BE ABLE TO SAY IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS SERIOUS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND IF YOU CAN DISPOSE OF THE CASE WITHOUT EXPOSING IT, YOU SHOULD DO THAT. Martha: 20 SECONDS LEFT. YOU TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THE INFORMATION AS WELL MEASURED AGAINST THE PRESS. YEAH, WELL, I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE PRESS IS UP IN ARMS OVER THIS. PERHAPS RIGHTLY SO. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING A REQUEST TO BE INTERROGATED AND THERE IS AN OBLIGATION ON THE SPECIAL COUNSEL PART TO
