so these secret touches that were
ancient Greek aqueducts where they would
channel the water from the river down to
the people of Naples they would channel
it up or a train during World War two
come down here will detection these are
some little toys
this monkey what do you see Wow he's
very narrow like yourself
the Romans built these aqueducts to
channel water up to the people in the
city and then in 1943 or the 1940s they
would use these aqueducts as shelters
from the bombings those are just
sculptures but here you can see the line
the water line so the water didn't rise
higher than that
this is the narrowest cave I've ever
been in yeah this is so cool
