1
00:00:01,027 --> 00:00:02,094
A GOOD ONE TO WATCH.

2
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:03,695
THE PRESIDENT IS THERE TODAY.

00:00:03,696 --> 00:00:05,364
>> Bill: WE'VE GOT TIME FOR

4
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:05,664
THIS.

5
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:07,466
NIKKI HALEY LAST NIGHT AT THE

6
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:10,068
AL SMITH DINNER WAS THE KEYNOTE.

00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:17,376
HONOR FOR THESE POLITICIANS.

00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:23,882
RYAN, WHO IS A BOY SCOUT.

13
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:24,349
THAT'S FINE.

14
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:24,816
A LITTLE BORING.

15
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:28,553
[LAUGHTER]

16
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:29,955
SO THIS YEAR YOU WANTED TO

00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:32,057
SPICE THINGS UP AGAIN, RIGHT?

00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:33,925
I GET IT.

00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:37,996
YOU WANTED AN INDIAN WOMAN, BUT

20
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,231
ELIZABETH WARREN FAILED HER DNA

21
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:39,531
TEST.

22
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:41,500
WHEN THE PRESIDENT FOUND OUT

23
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,034
THAT I WAS INDIAN AMERICAN HE

24
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:45,370
ASKED ME IF I WAS FROM THE SAME

25
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,606

00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:49,741
>> Bill: PRETTY GOOD LINE.

27
00:00:49,742 --> 00:00:52,577

00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:54,446
>> Bill: WHAT DOES SHE DO NEXT?

29
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:56,314
>> I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE WON'T

30
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:56,782
GO AWAY.

31
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:58,417
SHE WILL BE A PLAYER IN THE

32
00:00:58,418 --> 00:00:58,917
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

33
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,018
WE NEED WOMEN LIKE HER AND SHE

34
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,453
WILL BE A STAR.

35
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,221
>> Julie: SHE SAYS SHE WON'T

36
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:05,257
RUN JUST CAMPAIGN FOR TRUMP.

37
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:06,892
>> IT WOULDN'T BE SMART TO RUN

38
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,293
AGAINST TRUMP IN TWO YEARS BUT

39
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:10,629
SHE CAN BE A SENATOR IN THE

40
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,329
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
