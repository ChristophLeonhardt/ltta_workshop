1
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:03,115
AFTERMATH.

2
00:00:03,115 --> 00:00:04,984
I HOPE THE HOUSE MAJORITY

3
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:05,417
DEMOCRATS.

4
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:06,685
>> Trish: JOINING ME IS SEAN

5
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:08,687
SPICER, NOW SENIOR ADVISER AND

6
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:10,522
THE SPOKESMAN FOR AMERICA

7
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:12,424
FIRST ACTION AND THE AUTHOR OF

8
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:13,626
THE NEW BOOK.

9
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:14,693
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:15,694
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11
00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:16,195
HAPPY FRIDAY.

12
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:18,530
>> Trish: IT SEEMS LIKE

13
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,032
DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD NOT

14
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:22,935
TO SAY YEAH, I'LL ENDORSE HER.

15
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:25,237
WE HEARD EXCUSES BUT WHAT IS

16
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:26,438
THE REAL REASON WHY SO MANY

17
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:28,073
DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING AWAY

18
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:29,542
FROM NANCY PELOSI RIGHT NOW?

19
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:30,309
>> LOOK, YOU ARE RIGHT.

20
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:31,710
THIS SHOULD BE A NO-BRAINER.

21
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,113
IF YOU ARE THE CHAIR OF THE

22
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:35,614
D.N.C. YOU SHOULD SAY I

23
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:37,016
TOTALLY SUPPORT NANCY PELOSI,

24
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:38,017
SHE HAS DONE ALL THE GREAT

25
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,418
STUFF AND I'M 100% CONFIDENT

26
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:40,319
THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE

27
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,287
OVER THE HOUSE.

28
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:42,188
HE DID NEITHER.

29
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:43,823
I THINK THAT WAS TELLING ON

30
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:44,490
BOTH COUNTS.

31
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,791
I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE

32
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:49,028
FACT THAT THE IDEA THAT NANCY

33
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:53,065
PELOSI FROM SAN FRANCISCO

34
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:54,834
ISN'T PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH FOR

35
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:55,935
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEY

36
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:57,603
BELIEVE THE IDEAS ARE OLD,

37
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:58,737
TIRED, WORN OUT AND NOT THE

38
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:01,307
FUTURE OF THE PARTY SPEAKS

39
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:02,441
VOLUMES FOR WHAT TOM PEREZ

40
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,843
SEES FOR HIS OWN PARTY.

41
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:05,945
BUT I FOUND IT ILLUMINATING

42
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:06,912
WHEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY HE

43
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:08,113
SAYS HE HOPES THEY TAKE OVER

44
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:08,514
THE HOUSE.

45
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:09,915
IF YOU ARE THE CHAIR OF THE

46
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:11,283
D.N.C. OR THE CHAIR OF THE

47
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:12,518
R.N.C. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

48
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:13,819
OUT THERE EXPRESSING

49
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:14,653
UNBELIEVABLE CONFIDENCE IN

50
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:16,388
YOUR PARTY'S ABILITY TO WIN OR

51
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:19,158
MAINTAIN --

52
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:19,658
MAINTAIN MAJORITY.

53
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:20,860
HE DID NEITHER.

54
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,694
>> Trish: MAYBE HE IS NOT

55
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:23,028
GOOD AT HIS JOB.

56
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:23,996
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS WHAT

57
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:25,398
YOU ARE SAYING THAT THEY THINK

58
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:26,999
SHE IS NOT THE FUTURE OF THE

59
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:27,333
PARTY.

60
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,934
I HAVE TO SAY, LIKE, THEY

61
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:35,708
MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING.

62
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,444
SHE TALKS ABOUT HOW $1,000 IS

63
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:39,679
CRUMBS, SHE MAY NOT HAVE THE

64
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,181
FUTURE OF THE PARTY.

65
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,149
>> THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY

66
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,450
HAVE GONE DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE

67
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,486
AND SHE HAS TAKEN THEM OUT OF

68
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:48,154
THE MAJORITY, MULTIPLE TIME.

69
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:49,422
THE SINGLE GREATEST GIFT THAT

70
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:50,990
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS RIGHT

71
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,557
NOW.

72
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:54,494
>> THEY'LL MISS HER.

73
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:55,228
>> I WON'T!

74
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,029
I'M A BIG FAN OF NANCY PELOSI

75
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:59,232
STAYING IN CONGRESS FOR YEARS

76
00:01:59,232 --> 00:01:59,632
TO COME.

77
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:01,000
SHE IS A GREAT GIFT FOR US.

78
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,603
I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY

79
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:04,504
SYMBOLIC OF WHAT THE

80
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:05,838
DEMOCRATIC PARTY STANDS FOR.

81
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:07,206
ONCE WE EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE SHE

82
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:08,907
WOULD BE THE SPEAKER, WE MAKE

83
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:11,344
THAT RACE BINARY CHOICE.

84
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:12,245
AMERICA FIRST OUT THERE

85
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,446
RUNNING ADS AROUND THE COUNTRY

86
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:14,747
AND SUPPORTING CANDIDATES THAT

87
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:15,915
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WILL

88
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,083
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

89
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,017
POLICIES AND AGENDA.

90
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:20,186
AND THAT IF WE LOSE THE

91
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:21,888
MAJORITY, IT'S NANCY PELOSI

92
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,856
AND ADAM SCHIFF AND MAXINE

93
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:25,291
WATERS WHO ARE GOING TO TAKE

94
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,159
OVER THE HOUSE OF

95
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,693
REPRESENTATIVES.

96
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,094
THAT IS A VASTLY DIFFERENT

97
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:29,195
AGENDA THAN DONALD TRUMP AND

98
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:30,897
THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE

99
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:32,398
PASSING RIGHT NOW, THAT IS

100
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:33,533
BENEFITING SO MANY AMERICANS

101
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,234
FROM COAST TO COAST.

102
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:35,501
>> Trish: ISN'T THAT TRUE?

103
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:37,303
SO, HOW DOES KAVANAUGH AFFECT

104
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:38,104
ALL THIS?

105
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:40,573
HOW DOES KAVANAUGH AFFECT

106
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:40,940
MIDTERMS?

107
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,275
HOW DOES KAVANAUGH AFFECT THE

108
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,777
FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

109
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:48,348
AND THE FUTURE OF THIS

110
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:51,184
PRESIDENT?

111
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:51,785
>> INTERESTING QUESTION.

112
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:52,986
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT

113
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:54,054
BOTH SIDES HAVE DUG IN AND

114
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:56,423
THEY SEE THIS AS A POLARIZING

115
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:57,357
VIEW FOR THE SIDE.

116
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,092
ONE THAT IS GALVANIZING

117
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,026
SUPPORT FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.

118
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:02,228
THE INTERESTING THING THAT I

119
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:03,263
FIND FASCINATING IS FOR THE

120
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:04,631
FOLKS ON THE LEFT AND YOU SAW

121
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,633
NOT A SINGLE QUESTION IN THAT

122
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:07,934
CLIP ASKED OF TOM PEREZ.

123
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:11,805
THE DEPUTY CHAIR OF THE D.N.C.

124
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:12,939
ELLISON FROM MINNESOTA FACING

125
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,407
SIMILAR CHARGES AND ALL OF THE

126
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:15,842
FOLKS FROM THE DEMOCRATIC AND

127
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,911
THE LEFT SIDE HAVE YET TO

128
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:19,212
MENTION THE ALLEGATIONS THAT

129
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:20,313
ARE LEVELED AGAINST HIM AND

130
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:21,882
WHY HE IS STILL THE DEPUTY

131
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:28,221
CHAIR OF THE D.N.C.

132
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,990
THAT SHOULD BE ASKED OF EVERY

133
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,891
LEADERSHIP AND THE DEMOCRAT

134
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:31,691
AND RANK AND FILE.

135
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,394
IF THEY TAKE THIS SPECT TO

136
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:36,296
KAVANAUGH AND -- RESPECT TO

137
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:37,831
KAVANAUGH WHY ISN'T IT OKAY

138
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:38,799
FOR THEIR OWN?

139
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,834
>> Trish: FEMINISTS BACKED

140
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,002
BILL CLINTON WHEN HE TOOK

141
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,103
ADVANTAGE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN

142
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,037
WORKING AS THE INTERN.

143
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:45,338
THE DOUBLE STANDARD IN ALL OF

144
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,706
THIS CAN GET --

145
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:53,113
>> THAT IS ONE OF SEVERAL.

146
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,916
IN EVERY CASE THERE IS

147
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,550
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

148
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,651
IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE LEFT AND

149
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:58,785
THE POLITICALIZATION OF WHAT

150
00:03:58,785 --> 00:03:59,453
THE LEFT IS DONE.

151
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:00,654
THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS

152
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:02,656
THAT NEED TO BE ASKED OF KEITH

153
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,491
ELLISON, THE DEPUTY CHAIR OF

154
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:05,525
D.N.C., BILL CLINTON AND

155
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,694
OTHERS ON THE LEFT WHO HAVE

156
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:08,495
CREDIBLE ALLEGATION AGAINST

157
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:09,296
THEM AS WELL.

158
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:10,664
IT'S FASCINATING I THINK TO

159
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,299
SEE HOW IT IS ONE-SIDED IN THE

160
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:12,866
CHARGES.

161
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:13,900
>> Trish: SURE.

162
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,702
POLITICS AS USUAL.

163
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:17,137
ALL RIGHT.

164
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,238
>> WOMEN NEED TO BE TAKEN

165
00:04:18,238 --> 00:00:00,000
SERIOUSLY AND CREDIBLY.
