Wednesday morning Donald Trump announced at a press conference that he hoped that Vladimir Putin a man he said called President Obama the n-word do you know what the n-word is he's 30,000 deleted emails looking directly into camera Trump said it would be very interesting to see I will tell you this Russia if you're listening I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing Trump added I wish I had that power by the way they hacked the hack okay a few minutes later Trump said he wasn't sure Russia had hacked the DNC the media went crazy how dare Trump say such things how dare he suggest he wants America's enemies to have access to America's national security secrets that's insane itself obsessed guys Hillary Clinton deliberately built a private server knowing it was vulnerable to hack the Clinton Foundation took cash from Russian involved sources at the Russian Atomic Energy Agency raza Tom took over a company mining uranium in the United States with the approval of Hillary State Department yeah Trump's dumb to say he wants America's national security secrets disseminated among their enemies vitamins Trump it's Hillary's fault this is even a topic she exposed the secrets she did so on purpose the media's attempt to spin this one is a big boo-boo by Trump neglects the fact it wouldn't be an issue at all if not for Hillary's corruption and incompetence more to the point Democrats constantly attempt to get foreign powers to intervene on their behalf in elections in 1984 Teddy Kennedy actually asked the Soviet Union for their help in beating Ronald Reagan in the presidential election according to Forbes magazine quote Kennedy's message was simple he proposed an unabashed quid pro quo Kennedy would lend Andropov Yuri Andropov than the Prime Minister a hand in dealing with President Reagan in return the Soviet leader would lend the Democratic Party a hand in challenging Reagan in 1984 presidential election quote the only real potential threats to Reagan our problems of war and peace and soviet-american relations the memo stated these issues according to the senator will without doubt become one of the most important of the election campaign in the 1990s the Clintons you remember them they raised money from the Chinese government and they allegedly Declassified American nuclear secrets in return in 2008 senator Obama sent a letter directly to the ayatollahs in Iran telling them to hold off on conflicts until he could be re-elected in 2012 Obama told the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he wanted blad Mir Putin you remember that guy to hold off on aggressive action until he could provide flexibility after the election no Democrats don't get to claim the donald trump is the real threat to national security because he said something everybody knows he's thinking the man has no brain to mouth filter it's all verbal farts but hillary clinton has proved herself in actual national security threat it's her fault putin may have her emails not donald trump's which isn't to say the trump is stable he isn't during the press conference donald trump also suggested that the vice presidential candidate tim kaine has done a poor job running new jersey he was the governor of virginia Tom keen was the governor of New Jersey he also said he wanted to abrogate the Geneva Conventions and said he might consider letting the Russians take Crimea among other colorful moments when it comes to the Russians hacking Hillary it's not Trump who's the problem Hillary is everybody knows it despite the media spin i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show tends to demonize people don't care about your feelings okay so here we are we're finally here on facebook live and we'll give you a couple minutes extra against the advice of my producers just because you've been such good people waiting and waiting and waiting while hillary and the russians tried to hack this show but i want to begin there's so much to get to you today we're gonna start with the actual story of the convention so actual story of the convention is that the chaos continues the Sanders supporters are deeply unhappy with Hillary Clinton and they are not shy about talking about it or doing things about it so yesterday here's what happened a bunch of Bernie Sanders supporters actually walked out of the convention hall remember there was talk some of the Cruz people would do this at the RNC never happened at the DNC it actually happens here's the thing when you have a candidate who keeps talking about revolution and then he caves in the face of Hillary Clinton his revolutionaries aren't just gonna cave they're going to be revolutionaries which means that they walk out of the convention hall so here's the Sanders protesters walking out and then basically rioting in the streets almost you're parked outside of the local arena Fargo here in Chile and there is enough Ernie or fun demonstrators to meet the black lives matter protesters who were marching from City Hall and it was probably the biggest religion of protesters yet rather joining of protesters apparently four people were arrested in all of this and the protesters got wild they had themselves a good time apparently they were burning in American and Israeli flags that this is really ironic and hilarious they wanted to burn an American flag apparently but they had trouble finding one it's a democratic convention so of course they don't have an American flag the only one like it enough to have it there let alone burn it so here's video of them burning an Israeli flag yesterday and if chanting for intifadas you can't understand what they're saying their welfare so that's exciting the the Bernie fans also were the ones who stayed in the arena they were chanting at Cory Booker Cory Booker gave a speech yesterday in favor of Hillary Clinton and Bernie fans were chanting Warhawk and Cory Booker here's what it looked like very happy people wearing Robin Hood caps and being old so it's it's it's very it's very exciting yeah good time to the Democratic National Convention black lives matter protesters also showed up outside the DNC where they ordered white people to the back of their protest because there's nothing that says we run against racism like separating people by race and then ordering them to the back of a bus as we've known from history speaker it's a black lives matter protester doing the sort of date white people get to the back white people get to the back yeah I'm so glad this movement has the support of our race blind president okay so this is the real story of the convention is that this sort of this sort of activity continues but the story last night of course that the media wanted to trot out is that was Hillary Clinton's big moment yes she's been waiting years and years and years and decades centuries perhaps sitting in a cave somewhere plotting this rise to power and finally finally Hillary Clinton she's announced as the nominee for the Democratic Party and she and it's a it's a big moment so the Democrats decide that they put up pictures of all of the various presidents of the past all of them are men and then this is what they show inside the convention hall okay so in case you can't see that and first of all happy arenas MTV fest a lot of these folks Hilary's just smiling in the camera people are dancing like crazy in Chelsey's everybody actually saw what you actually saw was Hillary's giant face cracking glass which believe it or not is probably not the first time that's happened there are a couple things that reminded me of off the top of my head I mean when I saw Hillary's face come through and shatter glass twitch she pointed this out and they're exactly right there was a little bit reminiscent of of a commercial a famous commercial of the past here's what what that was hailer here bring the air they've got theirs down the run get a bitch yeah oh yeah Clinton and the kool-aid man the only difference is that children aren't afraid of the kool-aid man breaking through their walls there's another commercial by the way this looked a lot of like a lot like and that was the 1984 commercial of course right mr. sexual here comes just use it throwing a hammer until the right but not there and then you'll see we're gonna hammer those famous commercials a TV history okay so yes there are some famous images that came to mind when Hillary Clinton's face split a screen so the media made a huge deal out of this the media were crying and weeping oh my god it's just unbelievable Illinois clip 16 here's ABC talking about the tears of joy for Hillary Clinton tears of joy real emotion here on display tears of joy from Hillary Clinton supporters right now there are people all around me in tears as they watch this roll call vote as history is made tear there is a sense that history is being made we are seeing tears you can see tears coming down his eyes okay the only tears about Hillary becoming president is all the women bill will sexually assault in the future who will now be in Hillary's crosshairs hey let's be straight about this Hillary Clinton did not change anything yesterday she didn't change it and I'm so sick of conservatives so-called conservatives doing their students with Obama - oh what a milestone what a moment we finally have a black president yeah except he's gonna be the president and it turns out I didn't need to see a black guy's president to believe that black people could be presidents in the United States the only people who believe that are people who are misinformed about the nature of the United States by the Democratic Party and actual racists okay same thing is true for Hillary Clinton my wife is a doctor okay which means she's accomplished more in her short life than Hillary Clinton has in her entire life my wife is a doctor who takes care of people she never at any point in her life sat around thinking you know what I can't be a doctor until Hillary Clinton a corrupt old shrew becomes a presidential nominee my mom when I was growing up my mom worked and my dad was a stay-at-home dad and my mom's didn't sit around wondering can I run film and television companies I don't know I'll have to think about whether Hillary Clinton could become president there's also stupid women by the way our majority of bachelor's degrees master's degrees in associate's degrees next year according to the American Bar Association there will be a majority of law students in the United States American women don't need Hillary Clinton to shatter a glass ceiling that doesn't exist okay we are learning had a female Speaker of the House three female justices on the Supreme Court three of the last five secretaries of state have been women so this idea that that women are sitting around in their lives going oh you know I just I feel so held back and unless Hillary becomes president it's such crap also you know Hillary doing this whole routine like she's overcome obstacles because she's a woman is such such pure and unadulterated hokum it's such absolute nonsense of course that's not true Hillary has overcome obstacles such as blank and also blank hey Hillary Clinton was born rich married a guy rode his coattails to power abused his victims and then used that corruption to parlay herself into a Senate seat in New York with her husband helped grease the skids for with with a pardon of Mark rich and then she ran for president was terrible at it and she keeps failing upward this idea that women everywhere benefit because Hillary is president is just crap it's also not true I checked to the general idea Dennis Prager made this point this morning he's right I object to the general idea that minority groups first of all women are majority they're not a minority okay there are a large majority of voters and 54% of people who voted last time around were women so sides you the women are victims okay then they're wet then they're victims of women cuz women could theoretically band together and vote a woman if that was their top priority but minority groups don't need a token to be the the celebrity god leader in order for them to feel like they can achieve when was the last time you saw an asian-american on either half of the ticket and has never happened ever asian-americans are the most successful economic group in the United States Jews have had precisely one nominee for VP and it was Joe Lieberman in 2000 okay Jews have been highly successful in the United States the idea that black people needed a black president or females need a female president and such patent stupidity it's almost unbelievable and speaking of which you know the idea that Barack Obama became a black president and therefore black kids all over the United States pointed and they said I can do anything why is it then that racial polarization in the country is at an all-time high or at least a high modern high since the civil rights movement why is it that we're going backwards in terms of race relations if black kids feel better about the nature of America because we have a black president why is it that they don't actually feel better about the nature of America because we have a black president oh this is nonsense all this is poop and and and the media continue to cheer it forward because oh it's a historic moment oh it's such a historic moment the network's cheered Hillary's milestone and you can see them cheering Hillary's milestone you can see joy Reed of MSNBC saying that Hillary Clinton is going to teach us a lot about sexism but we keep on rediscovering who we are as Americans Barack Obama made us rediscover that we still have issues with race and you know what we still have issues with gender and Hillary Clinton is gonna teach us that lesson now as she runs oh how magical how magical so nice oh this is great so she's now talking up the idea that the Barack Obama divided us a long race which was now a good thing so Hillary will divide us along sexual lines and that'll also be a good thing this whole thing is just ridiculous Hillary has no qualifications to be President there's no reason she should be President she's awful on every score she's awful on every score even her husband bill can't make her more palatable so Bill Clinton spoke last night in an attempt to make Hillary seem like not the the Wicked Witch of the West failed dramatically so bill let off his speech and it was a 40 minute speech I mean he just kept jabbering and jabbering he kept thinking okay this is the last time I'm gonna be onstage I better get those ladies in the front row looking good so so bill is sitting there and he's talking about his relationship with Hillary Clinton and it was pretty creepy I got to admit I mean he was making out his relationship with Hillary Clinton to be like Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn in on Golden Pond you sit around and they listen to the loons do you hear the loons and they're just sitting around listening to the loons on the lake except for the fact that bill mails everything he can possibly find anything can get his hands on consent or no consent and Hillary then covers up for it it's been a perfect marriage and so he tells the story of how they met and it's kind of creepy and stalkerish when you consider the Bill Clinton is an actual alleged rapist say here's Bill Clinton doing that last night well I didn't join the Law Review but I did leave that library with a whole new rolling music it's from Halloween of course yes Bill Clinton the scariest man in the world I love that he says that I love that he says that he he met a girl he started off by saying he met a girl in the spring of 1971 in the spring of 1971 I met a girl the first time I saw her we were appropriately enough in a class on political and civil rights yet big blonde hair two big glasses or no makeup and she exuded this sense of strength and self possession that I found magnetic after the class I'd followed her out intending to introduce myself I got close enough to touch her back but I couldn't do it somehow I knew this would not be just another tap on the shoulder and I might be starting something I couldn't stop creepy stalker Belle talking about how is a romantic story of meeting Hillary Clinton it continues he went on like this for a long time then he saw the girl again he saw the girl again I saw the girl again standing at the opposite end of that long for the fire family she was staring back at me so I watched her she closed her book put it down and started walking toward me to off the whole length of library came up to me and said look if you're gonna keep staring at me and now I'm staring back we at least ought to know each other's name I'm Hillary Rodham who are you I was so impressed and surprised that what do you believe it or not momentarily I was speechless finally I sort of blurted out my name and we exchanged a few words and then she's like an apparition she sort of went away but don't worry that's not the end of this particular ghost story here's the end of this particular ghost story well I didn't join the Law Review but I did library with a whole new goal I went up to urchin said she was going to register for classes for the next row I said I'd go to and we stood in line and talked you had to do that to register back then and I thought I was doing pretty well till we got to the front of the line and the Registrar looked up and said bill what are you doing here you registered this morning I turned red and she laughed that big lamp of hers and I thought well heck since my covers been blown I just went ahead and asked her to take a walk down to the Art Museum we've been walking and talking and laughing together ever since okay so that's the end of that particular horror story and now they're both going to be President it's just terrifying or at least you would like to be first of all I would say to Bill bill in the future if you're gonna write your own speeches please don't say your cover has been blown under any circumstances it's a very poor choice of words for for Billiam Jefferson Clinton so pretty spectacular I have to credit my co-host Brian Whitman on the morning answer for the idea of the Halloween music because it really is it's just it's it's frightening I mean this guy he's a sexual-assault guy okay and he's Eddie's walking around acting like oh we just have the most beautiful marriage me and Hillary after I'd rape women she'd go up to them and she Pat their hand and she'd threatened them and that meant a lot to me that's what real marriage is all about and I think with all those times when I was having sex with anyone in a 30-mile radius and I would just go and bang a waitress just nail her and then I come home and Hillary would throw a lamp at me and say bill you stupid cretin you almost got caught that time and I need to be President that's when I realized I had made the right choice of that coke bottle wearing glasses wearing crazy haired wonderful wonderful woman I mean it's just crap it's supposed to humanize her the problem is you can't make a robot human okay this is just it's impossible you can't make a horrible hairatan like Hillary Clinton humans pretty spectacular pretty I love I love when he says I we heard that big laugh that we all know yeah that big horrifying laugh that we hear every time somebody asked have question yeah all right well we have to leave the Facebook live

so Bill Clinton he he wasn't just done with the whole trying to make Hillary into something she's not like a palatable human being well what's really funny about all of this you know it's really funny about all of this is that that bill actually could have done her some good last night all Bill had to do was come out and tell the actual story of their marriage not like the real actual story not like the part where they made a deal to both be President and heal and she'd let him knock around as much as he could possibly want and his deal with her would be she'd stay 15,000 miles away like right now bill wants her to be President so you can stay in Chappaqua and keep nailing the Energizer that's what they call his mistress the Energizer so I guess who's getting recharged between between sets but he just wants her as far away as possible like Secretary of State was a perfect job for her she was on a plane far away from him all the time which is you know the way that any loving man and wife want to be I know that when I go home at night the first thing I think is boy how can I get rid of this wife that's that's the first thing that I think you know what all he really had to do is we all know we all know the nature of their marriage if you wanted to make Hillary look good remember the time that Hillary was most popular in her career is right after we found out about Lewinsky and everybody felt really terrible for her we all fell like boys she really married a scoundrel and so everybody said oh well she must be a nice person and then it turned out of course she's not a nice person she's a harridan but for those five seconds everybody was very sympathetic although had to do is go out there and say I know my wife is the toughest strongest woman I have ever met and I know that because I have put her through some things that no husband should ever put a wife through and she's lived through them and she's been stronger for it right that's all he has to do he's in just an oblique reference and it would mean a lot he can't do it because that would undercut the whole were a hunky-dory couple routine and that's why I don't think the speech is gonna do her any good he went on to try and actually make the case for her and the case that he made for her was not a good case it was really not a strong case at all so this is let's go to 15 see this is Bill Clinton talking about why you need to elect Hillary Clinton well if you win elections on the theory that government is always bad and will mess up a 2-car parade a real change maker represents a real threat so you're only up your only option is to create a cartoon a cartoon alternative then run against the cartoon cartoons are two-dimensional they're easy to absorb life in the real world is complicated and real change is hard and a lot of people even think it's boring good for you because earlier today you nominated though real yeah I like cartoons I like those animate cartoons like the pornography anime cartoons but I don't like when people are made in the car this is so ridiculous first of all Hillary Clinton is in a cartoon she's actually a bad person who compromised national security for our own personal self aggrandizement and the clinton foundation is a giant slush fund for Bill and Hillary the two most corrupt people in American politics second of all the entire Democratic convention has been about cartooning Donald Trump now you don't need to turn Donald Trump into a cartoon since he actually is a cartoon like he's an actual two-dimensional person if he turned sideways he disappears Donald Trump is an actual cartoon he's like a flipbook a flipbook of silly okay but but that's what they've been doing the Republicans for years Jonah Goldberg I thought made a brilliant point on this he said one of the reasons Democratic rhetoric isn't working on Trump is they said the same things about Mitt Romney that are saying about Trump I mean they were saying about Mitt Romney he wanted to put y'all back in Chains they were saying about Mitt Romney he was uncaring and terrible and evil and horrible and and bombastic and nutty they're saying all these things about George w and so when they when they keep crying wolf about candidates and then finally they get Trump there's nothing left in the tank so this ain't gonna work and then he has to try and make an affirmative case for Hillary Clinton and here's his affirmative case for Hillary Clinton's 15d you could drop her into any trouble spot pick one come back in a month and somehow someway she will have made it better that is just who she is there are clear achievable affordable responses to our challenges but we won't get to them if America makes the wrong choice in this election that's why you should elect okay so I love that I love he says you can drop her in any trouble spot come back in a month and she will have made it better that is his personal experience with dropping hit with dropping her into trouble spots with his mistresses where you drop her there he kind of drive away and wait for Hillary to blackmail them into shutting up so that's exciting but this didn't work particularly well in Libya we sort of dropped Hillary in the middle of that one and that fell apart we dropped her in the middle of Syria that fell apart we dropped her into the middle of Ukraine and that fell apart we dropped her into the middle of the South China Sea that fell apart basically anything that Hillary touches turns into a crap show but he's saying you can drop her in any trouble spot and it gets better well that's because for Bill that's probably true she was his fixer she was his sexual fixer so yeah I mean I guess that's that's accurate for him but it certainly isn't accurate for the country and then this is my favorite part he says you need to elect her because she'll never quit on you and you sent electric because she'll never quit when the going gets tough she'll never quit on you she sent me in this primary to West Virginia where she knew we were going to lose to look those coal miners in the eye and say I'm down here because Hillary sent me to tell you that if you really think you can get the economy back you had 50 years ago have at it go forever you want to but if she went she is coming back for you to take you along on the ride to America's future there's a ride to America's future that sounds awesome but I don't know what ride he's talking about this is such crazy talk she never quits when the going gets tough okay Hillary Clinton the only thing that she hasn't quit when the going gets tough is her marriage okay everything else when it came to being senator she quit so that she could run for president when it came to running for president she quits as she could be Secretary of State when she became Secretary of State she quit after one term so that she could run for president again hey Hillary Clinton is is not somebody who you can count on if her interests don't line up with yours obviously but this wasn't the worst part of the convention last night I mean the entire media were just going booga wide over this there's a CNN commentator who said it just shows the kind of tenderness that bill has for Hillary yeah the same sort of tenderness that that a cow has for a barracuda like that's no bill just doesn't want to get stung that's all that's happening here that wasn't the worst part of the convention last night though the worst part of the convention was the mothers of the movement so the mothers of the movement show up the mothers of the movement we've been discussing for days these are a bunch of black women who have sons who are killed in in controversial circumstances by police or by neighborhood watch people in the case of Trayvon Martin or by random people at a gas station in one case and they speak at the DNC and this is just it's amazing so some first this is Geneva readville she's the mother of Sandra bland Sandra bland committed suicide in prison why is this lady speaking no one knows except to make the cops look bad because that's what the DNC is all about six other women have died in custody that same month Kendra Chapman Alexis McGovern Sarah Lee Circle Ben reineck Turner rau kina Jones and Joyce Cornell so many of our children are gone but they are not forgotten I am here with Hillary Clinton tonight because she is a leader and a mother who will say our children's names and she gets up there and she and she does this routine Jordan Davis I believe if I'm not mistaken I'm trying to remember all the names I believe Jordan Davis was the guy who was killed by the cops after he hit a cop in the neck with a baton if I'm not mistaken this is Lucy Macbeth his mommy talking about him Hillary Clinton isn't afraid to say that black lives matter she isn't afraid to sit at a table with grieving mothers and bear the full force of our anguish stop it for a second so myself so Jordan Davis I'm mixing up Jordan Davis and dontre Hamilton his mom's on the stage also Jordan Davis was murdered by a white guy at a gas station what does that have to do with anything no one knows no one knows it has to do with anything and then finally there's another mother of the movement who speaks and and this is the the mother of Michael Brown correct or is this Trayvon's mom it's maybe Trayvon's mom LLC in one second Hillary Clinton has the compassion and understanding to support grieving mothers she has the courage to lead the fight for common-sense gun legislation why is his lady speaking that tournament instead legislation she has a plan she has a plan to the bike that so often exists between law enforcement and the communities that they serve this isn't about being politically correct this is about saving our children with Hillary Clinton and that's why in memory of our children we are employing you all of you to vote this election day okay I know this whole routine Lesley McSpadden who's the mother of Michael Brown who tried to kill a cop was also up there why Sybrina Fulton should have anything to say about gun control is beyond me I don't understand what is her specialization here what does she know about gun control policy that nobody else knows other than her son got into a confrontation with George Zimmerman was sitting astride his body banging his head into the pavement when he was shot but it doesn't matter this is what the Democrats do they need to polarize Americans so that then they can bring us together around whatever figure they want to bring us together around and lately that's been Hillary Clinton okay so now it's time for some things I like and then an extra special episode of things that I hate so things I like we've been doing Russian villains so that is because the Russians apparently hacked the DNC and decided to release all of the DNC's emails so we're doing Russian villain movies so this is a movie that's really enjoyable it's not a great movie but it's a good movie the movie rounders I think they're talking now I'm out making a sequel I'm about poker Matt Damon and and Edward Norton is in it and and John Malkovich plays the the Russian villain so here's the here's the trailer No Limit Texas Hold'em is the Cadillac of Poker each player is dealt two cards facedown five cards are then dealt face-up across the middle these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five-card hand the key to the game is playing the man not the cards there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked go on tilt and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of them this is why the World Series of Poker is decided over a No Limit Hold'em table some people pros even won't play No Limit they can't handle the swings but there are others like Doyle Brunson who consider No Limit the only pure game left like Papa will end asset life is on the wire the rest is just waiting okay so the movies rounders good movie and and it's definitely it's a fun movie for sure okay things I like it's also Wednesday so that means it's Bible time a little Bible talk so so this week's in this week's Torah portion the part of the Torah that we read as I explain every week every every week the Jews read a different portion of the Torah so that by the end of the year we've gone through the entire five books of Moses and we do that every single year so this week's Torah portion is the portion of Pentecost finneus so this is about the this is about the fella in the Bible you may remember him who stabs a couple of folks and basically ends up becoming a priest because of it so the back story this is from numbers 25 10 through 13 so what happened just before this is that Phineas was a was a leader in the Jewish people and the Jews are confronted with the Midianites and the Midianite daughters start seducing the Jewish men and in seducing them into idolatry and one of the Jewish princes a guy named Zimmer II he comes and he comes into the camp and Moses has given the order you don't get to consort with unity with the enemy essentially this guy comes into the camp with it with one of the daughters of Midian and he proceeds to basically have sex in front of in front of the elders of the Jewish people and Moses doesn't know what to do and so phineas takes the spear and he kills both of them and so this is from numbers 25 10 it says the Lord spoke to Moses saying Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the coin has turned my anger away from the children of Israel by his Ellis Lea avenging me among them so that I did not destroy the children of Israel because of my zeal therefore say I hereby give him my covenant to peace it shall be for him and for his descendants after him an eternal covenant of kahuna that means priesthood because zealous for his God and atone for the children of Israel so you know it's a brutal story for sure but the real question is why didn't Moses know the law and this is a question asked by all the Jewish commentators why didn't Moses do it and Moses had already given the order you're not allowed to consort with the with the women from Midian because they're leading you into idolatry so why didn't Moses do anything about it the reason I think most so there are they're a bunch of different commentaries on this one a very famous Jewish commentator named Rashi he says that Moses basically had a moment of forgetfulness because that had started to come over him since he sinned with the rock which we talked about last week but what I think really happened here is that if you read a little bit earlier in the Bible Miriam who is Moses his sister comes to Moses and she says why are you married to this this woman who's not Jewish right there's this section in the Bible a couple chapters earlier why aren't you married so that why are you married to Zipporah why are you married to sapore this this woman who's not Jewish and Moses and Moses doesn't really have an answer God punishes Miriam for asking the question I think what happened here is that Moses was looking at the situation and he felt like a hypocrite he felt like okay why is it that I'm allowed to marry a woman who's not Jewish but these this guy is sleeping with a woman who's not Jewish and it's a big deal I feel like a hypocrite now the reason I think this is important the reason I takes phineus to come in and say no no you don't get to you don't get to just do what you want because people have sinned in the past or made mistakes in the past or because they had an exception in the case of Moses I think that the reason this is important is because so much of American politics so much of how we think about values and issues goes back to the sins that we've committed leftism is a religion without the process without the possibility of repentance in leftism if you committed a sin when you were when you were 18 if you went to Woodstock and slept around in you're 18 you have to spend the rest of your career talking about why abortion and sexual promiscuity is great because if anybody says to you wait now you're preaching virtue but when you're a kid you didn't you can't say right I made mistakes I made mistakes is not part of the leftist house it's not part of their their it's not part of theirs the Souris it's not part of their dictionary they they don't know it's that their lexicon does not include that phrase I made mistakes instead it is the idea is if you sinned then really you are standing up against the prevailing value system and now forevermore you have to stand on the side of your sin against the value system this is this is why baby boomer parents have done such a terrible job to the country because they've said to their own kids I can't condemn bad action you take because I did it when I was younger no you can that's sort of the purpose of being a parent the purpose of living life is you make mistakes you learn from the mistakes and you don't repeat them but as a society we've become so Petty and stupid we become so permissive in our ideas of what is good and what is bad that we've decided that every time we do something wrong we have to spend the rest of our life defending the thing we did wrong rather than just going out and saying I made a mistake it's one of the things that bothers me deeply about both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump I think both of them do this I think Donald Trump when he says I don't feel the need to repent I don't want to be the kind of guy who has to repent if you're a religious person you spend your entire life repenting right in Judaism we do basically a form of repentance two times a day I mean we actually we actually do what's called takumin two times a day we do it in the morning service in the afternoon service immediately after Yom Kippur when we've done all of our repentance and supposedly the slate is wiped clean we immediately go into the evening service and even the evening service has a paragraph in the silent Amida and the silent service that specifically talked about repentance lala know right so that so the idea is no meaning forgive us the idea is we're constantly repenting for the sins we commit the standard doesn't change because you sinned the standard is what it always was you may have made mistakes but that doesn't mean that everybody else gets to throw away the standard because you made mistakes and I think that's the lesson here is that Phineas is saying you have to be zealous on behalf of the standard and even if you made mistakes in the past even if you're ashamed of those mistakes even if you feel like a hypocrite the standards did not change just because you feel like a hypocrite okay time for one more thing that I like so Hilary Clinton released a photo celebrating her nomination and here is the picture right so it says we made history Hillary for America and it's a picture of a woman in a hijab crying and it looks like she's celebrating Hillary I mean look how moving this is one problem she tweets out this woman tweets out a picture of herself with Bernie Sanders and says guess you still didn't get the memo hashtag still Sanders hashtag Iman immigrant hashtag I support Palestinian so they grabbed a photo from the sleigh and it turns out she's crying because Hillary's a nominee they thought they were tweeting it out because it's such a moving moving tribute and it turns out she doesn't want Hillary to be the nominee in the first place okay time for some things that I hate so celebrity culture has overtaken both parties in the Republican Party we felt the necessity to have speakers like Antonio sabato jr. whose most famous for dancing in a Janet Jackson video and and Natalie Gulbis who I guess is an LPGA Tour lady the Democrats really do this right the Democrats bring out every celebrity they can find it really makes kind of sick to your stomach because it demonstrates how our culture has been taken over see here's what happens the human tendency Kevin Williamson has a good piece about this today at National Review I don't think it's complete but it's very good he talks about the tendency of human beings to follow celebrity says it doesn't make any sense because we don't even know these celebrities that's because the human being has a tendency to follow royal families we do we have a tendency to find people that we like and then to use them as shortcuts for thinking we're constantly finding shortcuts for thinking because there are so many decisions we have to make every day so we do this with celebrities we find people that we like and then we say well Taylor if Taylor Swift thinks that's cool then it must be cool if Lena Dunham thinks that's cool you know the lady who looks like a roasted potato that means that it must be cool and I'm by the way I make fun of lena Dunham's physical appearance because it is legitimately her only claim to fame and she herself basically gets naked so that anyone will pay attention to her that's why I specifically make fun of her so that's actually a pointed criticism of lena Dunham's physical appearance the fact that she looks like a russet potato so sia that has did a version of this song that I hate called fight songs I hate the song in the first place this fight song song because number one my my understanding is the song is about a breakup and it's some lady whining and singing about this is my fight song by I'm alright song everything is I'm gonna be fine I'm gonna be fine it's okay lady you didn't go to Afghanistan like really you broke up with the dude yeah is it a fight song or is it just like get over it it's such a fight song is it not Lindsay isn't here today so I can trip on her brave tattoo but it's the same sentiment it's the same basic concept fights out so anyway they decide they're gonna have a fight so they do a version of fight song with every celebrity you can imagine in favor of you guys did Hillary Clinton who's had to fight herself through all sorts of obstacles including marrying the President of the United States growing up wealthy going to all the best schools and getting a handout from the FBI every time she commits a criminal act so those are real obstacles and so she's really had to fight here all the celebrities basically endorsing her hilary so their CEO doing go hillary at the very end looking like something out of a freak show I don't understand what's going on here with CEA's hair I don't understand if she was standing in a place where they were spray painting a wall or what happened I don't understand why she looks like a poodle that needs a hair trim but I don't understand anything about popular culture anymore oh no no great shock there is it look too well produced video obviously they've got all the people from pitch perfect singing and they've got the people from Modern Family singing and all the people in the Democratic Party are just so happy because all the celebrities love us that means we're special what a special good you get no you're not special these people know who you are none of them care they probably cut you dead if you met them at the grocery ran because they do it all the time I live in LA okay most of these celebrities are kind of jerky they don't like being confronted they don't like having people talk to them or even ask them for autographs but we have to worship at their altar okay folks as I always say don't worship people I really think by the way this had an impact on the Republican race too because we found the greatest that we found the most significant person that we could find and the most publicly available person we could find Donald Trump and decided to make him our nominee and it wasn't you didn't stop with that Meryl Streep showed up to cheer for Hillary Clinton leaving everybody wanting a Silkwood shower so here is Meryl Streep what does it take to be the first female anything well first you have to have sex with Bill Clinton once it takes grip and it takes grace yeah Hillary is great Hillary Clinton has taken some fire over 40 years like on a tarmac in Bosnia of her fight for families and children to kill the ones that aren't born does she do it how does she she's so strong what I want to know where does she get her grip where does she get it where do any of our female first our path breakers you know where do they find that strength you people have made history yeah so did the people who built the Titanic and you're gonna make history again in November okay I love the crabs oh my god no Street buy remember her from Devil Wears Prada she must have something valuable to say okay I can't I can't I can't and you can already see she's already getting her hair ready to play Hillary Clinton in the next movie I mean this is this is what she does hell it by the way I want to say this about Meryl Streep Meryl Streep is one of the most overrated actresses in the history of American cinema the last great movie that she made great movie that Meryl Streep made was legitimately Deerhunter back in the 1970s she is so overrated Katharine Hepburn once said about Meryl Streep and it's totally true the problem with Meryl Streep as you can see all the gears turning and that's exactly right she's a mechanical actress for mechanical candidate but that even that wasn't all Alicia Keys showed up to stump for gun control at the DNC women why the answer no no we have the power to ensure that this country gets on the right path I dedicate this song to the mothers of the movement and all mothers who have lost their sons and their daughters to sense its violence until we deal with gun violence in this country we can't claim home in a brain alright we can we don't have to listen to this so associate so Alicia Keys must know she must know everything we need women if women around the world would be so much better yes that's true Madame Mao was just a delight Evita perón just a delight there's no such thing as women are better than men or men are better than women there are bad people and there are good people and they come in all shapes and sizes and sexes and colours again this idea that we just need a woman I don't remember Alicia Keys saying that about Sarah Palin for VP call me crazy I remember her stumping for Carly Fiorina on that basis and I love that when when people say people are victims of senseless violence no they're victims of people who commit senseless violence it's not like there's some guy with a big shirt that says senseless violence just walking around on the street and if you just walk close to him he hits you with the two-by-four it's so so ridiculous all the way through and then finally the greatest of all celebrities russet potato Lena Dunham standing next to I think it's America Ferrera right America Ferrera who's who hasn't been in a show that's successful for at least ten years and here is Lena Dunham looking just her best straight off of eating cake naked on a toilet and here's here she's speaking of I am a pro-choice feminist sexual assault survivor with a chronic reproductive illness your victim Donald Trump and his party think I should be punished for exercising my constitutional rights his rhetoric about women takes us back to a time when we were meant to be beautiful and silent meanwhile 22 years ago Hillary Clinton declared that women's rights are human rights okay so my favorite thing about this was that they first started this thing with Lena Dunham saying Donald Trump probably thinks I'm a - no no he doesn't that's a wild over estimate and then America Ferrera turns to Lena Dunham and she says he thinks I'm probably a rapist it's a good thing as Jonathan hay points out it's a good thing they didn't switch that line because Lena Dunham actually Brad now basically molesting her sister in her own memoir but yeah this is all these celebrities we have to we have to pay attention to all them they're very deep and important human beings okay finally we conclude with stuff I hate Donald Trump just couldn't keep his mouth shut today so Donald Trump does a a press conference and it's meant to draw fire away from the Democratic National Convention and draw attention away and he says a lot of kind of crazy things he says that he hopes the Russians release Hillary's emails here's what he had to say about that I will tell you this Russia if you're listening I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press okay so he wants the Russians say he hopes they hacked Hillary Clinton he's getting condemned over this I don't think that it's particularly terrible Trump I think that everybody's going nuts over oh my god he wants them to act Hillary Clinton set up a private server and made herself vulnerable to the hack if everybody knows he'd be happy if they released those emails because he'd become president in all likelihood so I'm not gonna be all over a lot of people are all over Trump on that today doesn't make much of a difference to me I don't think that's a particularly important Trump failure then Trump actually made a good point so here it's time for some good Trump where I shouldn't be a little favorable to Trump today so here is it Donald Trump talking about why Hillary is not an agent of change Bill Clinton called Hillary a change maker yesterday to which I thought she works at 7-eleven but but if Donald Trump says don't worry there won't be any change with Hillary Clinton when they talk about change I noticed they have changed she's been there for thirty years thirty years there's no change it's gonna be the same it's gonna be an extension of Obama and my opinion worse okay it's good and he's right he's totally right about this okay so you're the okay and because there's good Trump there also has to be bad Trump here as Donald Trump and the Geneva Conventions is the last clamp yeah I think everything's out of date we have a whole new world when I said that NATO the Wolf Blitzer is obsolete I got attacked three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right you know what we have a lot of things that are today because they're twenty and thirty and forty years old NATO you know this is in a country from 40 years ago today we have a we have a terror threat and we have an Isis threat and by the way Isis isn't even mentioned it's not even mentioned during the Democratic convention ok and everyone's talking about it so he's saying at the end there is exactly right of course but this stuff about he was asked about the Geneva Conventions and he says they're out of date no they really are not they really are not in any major way anyway he doesn't know anything about the Geneva Conventions he was also asked apparently whether he would let Russia annexed Crimea and he said well may he said I would think about it he said sure I'd think about it ok then I think the real answer there is that I'm not sure that he knows either what the word annex means or what Crimea is the last time you heard about in annex it's when he was learning to read at the Learning Annex but he but when he says that when he says these sorts of things I don't think he thinks them through but you know this is the choice that we've been given this is the choice before us as always there will be more tomorrow because this election is never ending but at least we laugh at the circus right I mean at least we can laugh at the at the image of Bill Clinton back in 1971 stalking Hillary Clinton be tonight it'll get even more fun tonight Barack Obama is speaking at the convention and he's gonna declare himself Emperor I think he may actually just what if he actually just declares himself a woman and then he's the first female president I feel like that would be his strongest move tonight it would really take it would really take wouldn't that one that just destroy Hillary like we just got up there and he said you know what I'm a woman and then be like oh my god he's the first female black president Hillary we have no need for you Joe Biden come on down maybe it'll happen I don't think it will but I've been proved wrong on everything else this election cycle i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show you
