Hilary Clinton is back she announced on Tuesday that she takes responsibility for losing the 2016 presidential election of Donald Trump sort of according to the newly defined former Democratic leader she takes quote absolute personal responsibility for her loss but she adds that quote I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28th and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who are inclined to vote for me and got scared off if the election had been on October 27th I would be your president but aside from that she takes responsibility she also added the places that didn't vote for her couldn't get quote cell coverage for a mile um no what does she have going on next she says I'm now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance really what exactly is she resisting this rogue one she dragged her party down almost single-handed in the in the last election cycle now she wants to be part of the cool kids crowd again this is precisely what's wrong with Hillary Clinton and what her husband understood you can't hijack a popular movement with which you had nothing to do Bernie Sanders maybe Hillary Clinton knew but perhaps Hillary still has 20/20 ambitions those rumors are still floating out there and right now the three leading 20/20 candidates for the Democrats are all around her age Elizabeth Warren who's a young 67 Joe Biden 74 years old and Bernie Sanders who's 75 years old she is a youthful 69 what's to stop her from running again herein lies the problem for the Democrats all of their top names are old fogies with no youth appeal other than the geriatrics not so socialists who isn't technically a Democrat their youth movement however has no exact target it's just a lot of people angry about a lot of different things complaining about the evils of patriarchal heterosexist cysts normative society hillary cannot lead that bunch republicans should be very excited to see hillary back in play just so they should be excited that barack obama's making a comeback obama and hillary helped raise a generation of democrats now those salty earth i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show okay

to Children's Hospital he had to have emergency heart surgery I guess who's born maybe at Children's Hospital or at least they transferred him over there and human Kimmel tells the story and then he turns into a pitch for Obamacare and I want to talk about this because I have some personal thoughts on the matter a little over a week ago on Friday April 21st my wife Molly gave birth to a boy baby boy and he appeared to be a normal healthy baby until about three hours after he was born when a very attentive nurse at cedars-sinai hospital her name is nunu she was checking him out and heard a murmur in his heart which is common with newborn babies but she also noticed he was a bit purple he did an x-ray and his lungs were fine which meant his heart wasn't so now more doctors and nurses and equipment come in and it's it's a terrifying thing I'm up you know my wife is back in the recovery room she has no idea what's going on and I'm standing in the middle of a lot of very worried looking people kind of like right now we were trying to figure out what the problem is it's Friday night and so they call a pediatric cardiologist dr. Evans on they did an echocardiogram which is a sonogram of the heart and found that Billy was born with a heart disease something called tetralogy of hello with pulmonary atresia it's hard to explain basically the pulmonary valve was completely blocked and he has a hole in the wall between the left and right sides of his heart and then they brought my wife in and they wheeled her in and doctors on told her what was going on what our options were we decided to take him to Children's Hospital where there's a world-renowned cardiac surgeon who was by all accounts a genius his name is dr. von Starnes so we put the baby in an ambulance the Children's Hospital Los Angeles and on Monday morning dr. Starnes opened his chest and fixed one of the two defects of his heart and went in there with a scalpel and did some kind of magic that I couldn't even begin to explain he open the valve and the operation was a success it was the longest three hours of my life and I have a list of people I want to thank for making that happen and I hope I have my list these are just some of the people who played a part in this it was an enormous team effort really was at and I want to see one other thing President Trump last month proposed a six billion dollar cut in funding to the National Institute of Health and thank God our congressman made a deal last night to not go along with that they actually increased funding by two billion dollars ten of the people who would have been affected by those cuts of the National is due to help our children and it would have a major impact on a lot of great places including Children's Hospital Los Angeles which so unbelievably sad to me we were brought up to believe that we live in the greatest country in the world but until a few years ago millions of millions of us had no access to health insurance at all you know before 2014 if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was there was a good chance you'd never be able to get health insurance because he had a pre-existing condition you were born with a pre-existing condition if your parents didn't have medical insurance you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition if your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to it shouldn't matter how much money you make that I think that's something now whether you're a Republican or Democrat or something else we all agree on that right I mean okay so I have some experiences here now to talk about them and I don't really talk about this a lot because I don't like to make my family life an issue on the show and in politics generally okay a couple of years ago this have been mid of 2015 my daughter was born in January 2014 mid 2015 like July 2015 my daughter who is a beautiful little girl she is she is she has the flu and she starts throwing up and when she's throwing up she same thing and we don't know why and so we take her into the very scary room and she's like Keeling over literally fainting dead away while she's throwing up and it turns out that it was breath-holding we didn't know that so we go to the ER and they do a bunch of tests on her and one of the tests they do is they run an EKG on her and they say the EKG looks basically normal but we just want to have some follow-up send us to a cardiologist and the cardiologist takes a second look and does an ultrasound then tells us that she has a heart murmur not just a heart murmur it's actually such a large hole in Harsha in atrial septal defect nasty and she had a heart murmur that was so you couldn't hear it because the hole in her heart was so large that he couldn't actually normally the heart murmur comes from you hear the blood flowing the wrong way through the heart you couldn't hear it because the hole was so large in her heart so in August of last year she had to or in August of 2015 rather she had to have open-heart surgery the surgeon was dr. Vaughn Starnes exactly the same surgeon who worked on Jimmy Kimmel's kid it was at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles could not be more grateful to Children's Hospital LA or dr. Starnes who is indeed the master of his craft there's a reason he's the best in the world and we were lucky enough to be able to to work with him and he obviously did the work and saved our daughter's life I mean she she wouldn't have died immediately wasn't like an emergency situation quite as much as Jimmy Kimmel's Ketut sounds like but she would have had feller to thrive as she got older she would have had to have open-heart surgery I think they hadn't detected it would have shorter lifespans his you know 30 or 40 now they fixed it she's good as new thank God everything is fine and she's great the reason that I tell this story is because when Jimmy Kimmel starts talking about the National Institutes for health and federal funding and health insurance and all the rest of us the reason that I was able to get great coverage for my kid is because I was employed and also because my wife and I had health insurance long before we had a kid he's missing a couple of key points here and I wanted to establish sort of the bonafide he's here so I'm speaking about so I'm not speaking from the perspective of someone who hasn't experienced nearly identically what Jimmy Kimmel has experienced here it was absolutely terrifying when you go and you meet with the doctor and the doctor tells you your kid you know even if the doctor says it's a surgery that's done regularly it's still frightening as all hell because they're cracking open your kid's chest and cutting or open and and you know it was in hooking or tubes it was really terrifying and horrifying and thank god she's okay but the point is that when he immediately connects that to federal funding when he commedia connected to Obamacare I don't like the process as a general rule I don't like the process of using personal stories like this to push for legislation or to push for public policy because it doesn't necessarily follow and what I mean by this is again dr. Starnes great doctor children hospital grade hospital most of the people when we were in Children's Hospital during the recovery we were in the ICU for about a week when we were in Children's Hospital most of the people who are in Children's Hospital I know this because my wife rotated through Children's Hospital because she's a doctor in the LA area a huge number of the kids in Children's Hospital are not kids who have great insurance many of them don't have any insurance the fact is that in the United States of America if you have an emergency situation like Jimmy Kimmel had let's just assume this happened at cedars-sinai again where my wife gave birth let's assume that the exact in situation happened but there was no insurance and doctor spotted that there was this emergency surgery that had to happen in order to prolong the child's life they don't ask insurance they immediately send the kid over to Children's Hospital and dr. Starnes works on the kid because and then somebody else fills the gap Children's Hospital is very lucky and the Children's has enormous sums of giving people give tons of money to Children's Hospital I'm sure Jimmy Kimmel will too we giving charity to Children's Hospital people there's a whole wall an entire wall in Children's Hospital that is just names of celebrities who have given money to Children's Hospital to help support Children's Hospital people are generous with their giving people want to save people who are in need the problem with the argument that we have to cover pre-existing conditions which is basically what Jimmy Kimmel is saying here is number one when it comes to children it is the job of the parents to have health insurance when the kid is born because the parents health insurance covers the kid right the fact is that my kid was not buying her own health insurance when she was a year and a half old we had health insurance it covered her that doesn't mean that if there's a gap that we as a community shouldn't step in that's what charities for that's why hospitals cover the gap that's why costs are passed on very often through a backdoor method via the hospital to people who do have insurance but it does say that it is a mistake as a society to simply say to people that there is no moral responsibility to get health insurance well you're healthy well you don't have health problems because if you don't do that if there if you just say whenever you get sick you can immediately take advantage of the system people will wait to get sick to take advantage of the system and you will end up bankrupt things of the system the reason the children's is so great is because children get paid lots of money they get paid lots and lots and lots of money to do these sorts of things dr. Starnes I'm sure millions of dollars a year and he deserves every penny that he makes and he's able to do that because there are people paying voluntarily into health insurance to cover themselves so when something bad happens he gets paid dr. Starnes is not somebody who should be working for 60 grand a year like a postal worker if you do that to the health system you're not going to be able to get the kinds of surgeries that dr. Starnes provides or the kind of care that Children's Hospital provides and I think it's deeply important that when we talk about everybody getting the sort of care that you make a most kid got or that my kid gets in order for that to happen you have to make it affordable and quality the only thing that does that is a free market and again that doesn't mean there shouldn't be a safety net provided by a society and I'm talking about through government now I'm talking about through charity and through communities and through charity hospitals all of that is true but to use a personal situation that is really difficult and breaking in order to promulgate a public policy that actually doesn't achieve what you're seeking to achieve children is not worthwhile Children's Hospital could not be what Children's Hospital is if it existed is a public sector Hospital unless you are willing to tax people up the wazoo and that sort of taxation scheme bankrupt countries and doesn't provide the same care anyway look at the National Health Service in Britain or the or the nationalized health care service in Canada this is the I have nothing but sympathy for Jimmy Kimmel because I've been through as I say exactly the same thing and it's heartbreaking and that heartbreak should not be used as a political tool in order to push a political agenda and I'm sure that Jimmy Kimmel believes have reward that he's saying but funding for the National Institutes of Health has nothing to do with what happened here again the American people are insanely generous the amount of research that goes into the sorts of techniques that dr. Starnes used is tremendous and it's not from the public sector and most in the most part it's actually from the private sector ok so I wanted to get that out of the way before I go on here going to talk about Mayday and what the left is showing of itself and then I want to talk about the Trump budget before I get to any of that I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so my Patriots apply if you are deeply concerned about what's going on in the world right now you need to talk to my friends over at my Patriot supply and I'm about to tell you why nobody at this office is prepared for any sort of emergency of any kind you know I asked Mathis the other day what would happen if there was like an EMP attack by North Korea or an earthquake or a zombie outbreak you have a flashlight or potable water what we do and his answer was we need Austin yep no preparedness no going hungry for even a day no percent in trouble Chiapas Austin Edom my suggestion was slightly less severe we should probably drop ten bucks on like a wireless radio and stock up on some delicious emergency meals from my Patriot supply they taste like home cooking and get a four week supply for just 99 bucks and prepare with been calm they will even cover the shipping they'll make sure you're safe your family safe prepare with Ben calm your life might depend on it especially apparently if you work with Mathis Mathis is you know and it is hard to work for when the maps of time I had you above the disc cartoon has mapped as a ser precisely correct it's eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen prepare with Ben calm if you want that four-week emerge the food supply for just 99 bucks it's something that you owe to yourself if you're worried about natural disaster or if you are worried about some sort of governmental disaster of any kind check it out prepare with Ben dot-com okay so yesterday was of course May Day the the winning internet meme of the day goes of course to Justin Timberlake who immediately tweeted out hey guys it's May which is amazing for people who don't remember the days of in sync and it's May then then you've missed out in any case the the communist Madia decided that it was a perfect time to go out and rampage and loot things demonstrating of course the tolerance is the greatest attribute of the people on the left here's what it looked like at the protest in in Portland and breaking news made a protest going on right now in several cities including Los Angeles in Washington State things started getting violent in Portland we're seeing pictures of several disturbances just in the last several minutes we should tell you the official of protests there made a protest was actually canceled by by police because police say of the presence and the behavior of what they described as anarchist we've been watching now over the last several minutes a group of anywhere from 100 or more people of many of them dress in black some have been setting fires there you see police trying to trying to put out sideways right there the made a photo I mean it's really demonstrating what kind of society they would like to build if they had the opportunity or the society they would like to destroy if they had the opportunity every year in Seattle they have made a violence and people throw things through windows and they protest against capitalism made AI think is a good time for us to remember let's say the hundred million people who died due to communism over the course of the 20th century I thought that the most amazing picture is from Venezuela on may day there was some woman holding a made a bag while waiting in line for a loaf of bread which pretty much sums up the entire made a thing the left keeps paying tribute tomato it's absurd May Day is not a holiday May Day is a day of tragedy if we're talking about the rise of the communist Left which has killed more people than all the religious wars in history so that is that is worth noting on the day after May okay well I want to talk about President Trump and whether he is being effective but we'll get to that you have to go over to Daley wire.com right now I have
