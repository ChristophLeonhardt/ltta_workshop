let's say that you didn't get the first class in you're sitting in coach how on earth are you going to be able to fall asleep so first of all let's talk about turbulence it turns out that the middle of the fuselage is the most stable part because that's where the wings are attached so if you can get a seat that's on or close to a wing you're going to have far less bumpy of a ride which will obviously help with sleep if you're trying to fall asleep and you're you're not like over six feet tall getting a window seat turns out to be much better because you actually have something to lean your head against to be able to relax to be able to fall asleep obviously you want to tilt your chair back as best you can you want to have your seats to be away from either the lavatory or the galley those are places where people have a tendency to congregate and make quite a bit of noise there's also funky smells that can come from the laboratory or from the the galley that you obviously want to avoid I actually personally bring a sleep kit with me in my bag thora carry-on which has I shade z' earplugs and some type of music that I can listen to the help relax me whether that's a meditation or a relaxation tape or actually there's specific music that's now being designed to help people fall asleep
