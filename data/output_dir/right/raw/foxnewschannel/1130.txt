1
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:12,965
>> NEW DETAIL UNCOVERS LINK TO

2
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:15,467
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

3
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:17,169
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GREEN

4
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:20,272
LIGHTED IRANIAN ACCESS TO THE

5
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:21,707
U.S. BANKING SYSTEM AND WOULD

6
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:25,678
HAVE ALLOWED THE TRANSFER OF

7
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:32,250
BILLIONS THERE'S AMERICAN

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:32,685
INSTITUTIONS.

9
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:35,721
THIS FELT LIKE A BOMB SHELL TO

10
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:35,988
ME.

11
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:37,857
>> IRAN HAD ACCESS TO A NUMBER

12
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:38,991
OF BANK ACCOUNTS AROUND THE

13
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,392
WORLD BECAUSE OF THE IRAN

14
00:00:40,392 --> 00:00:41,260
NUCLEAR DEAL.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,629
BUT THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS

16
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,198
ONE BANK ACCOUNT IN OMAN.

17
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,869
THEY HAD $6 BILLION THERE AND

18
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:51,871
THE MONEY WAS IN LOCAL CURRENCY.

19
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:54,173
IF THEY WANTED THE MONEY, THEY

20
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:58,410
WOULD HAVE TO CONVERT IT TO

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,279
EUROS OR DOLLARS.

22
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,313
SO THE UNITED STATES WITH THE

23
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:02,615
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GRANTED A

24
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:04,416
LICENSE TO ESSENTIALLY HELP OUT

25
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,352
IRAN, ALLOW IT TO DIVERT THE

26
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:08,153
MONEY THROUGH A U.S. BANK AND

27
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,889
CONVERT IT TO EUROS EVEN THOUGH

28
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:10,956
OFFICIALS WOULD SAY THAT THEY

29
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:14,326
WEREN'T GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO

30
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:15,461
DO THAT.

31
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:18,764
>> THE IRANIANS WANTED ACCESS TO

32
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,099
THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

33
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,235
I THINK THEY WERE MAKING THAT A

34
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,537
CONDITION FOR THE AGREEMENT, FOR

35
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:26,272
THE FINAL AGREEMENT.

36
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,042
AND SO ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SAYING

37
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:31,877
TO THE CONGRESS, THE OFFICIALS

38
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:34,313
AT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT THAT

39
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:37,049
THERE WAS NO ACCESS, IN FACT

40
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,918
THEY GRANTED A SPECIFIC LICENSE

41
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:41,387
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM.

42
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:43,355
>> A FORMER ADMINISTRATION

43
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:46,392
OFFICIAL REFUSED TO GO ON THE

44
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:50,095
RECORD AND TELLS US THE LICENSE

45
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:53,198
FULFILLED ACCESS TO LET IRAN GET

46
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,600
THE MONEY OVERSEAS.

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,136
THE LICENSE CANNOT BE DESCRIBED

48
00:01:57,136 --> 00:02:01,473
AS GIVING ACCESS TO THE U.S.

49
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:03,509
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

50
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,578
THE REPORT SAYS THAT IRAN NEVER

51
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:07,613
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS BECAUSE

52
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:11,216
THE U.S. PUSHED TWO BANKS TO

53
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,918
EXECUTE THE DEAL AND THE BANKS

54
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:14,119
REFUSED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT

55
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,588
TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN.

56
00:02:16,588 --> 00:00:00,000
EVENTUALLY IRAN GOT THE MONEY
