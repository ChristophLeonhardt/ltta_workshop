>> THE FAILURES OF THE
GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL
CONTINUE TO COME TO LIGHT WHEN
IT COMES TO THE KILLINGS AT
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN PARKLAND,
FLORIDA.
PARAMEDICS REVEALING THEY TRIED
TO GET INTO BUILDINGS SIX TIMES
BUT WERE HELD BACK BY THE
BROWARD SHERIFF'S OFFICE, DURING
THE CRUCIAL MINUTES WHEN
STUDENTS' LIVES MAY HAVE BEEN
SAVED.
THIS COMES DAYS BEFORE THE
SENIORS THERE WILL RECEIVE THEIR
DIPLOMAS, AND THEY ALL HAVE
STORIES TO TELL.
WE WENT DOWN TO STONEMAN DOUGLAS
AND TALKED TO TWO YOUNG WOMEN
WHO LOST THEIR BEST FRIEND,
MEADOW POLLACK.
>> FEBRUARY 14th, I WAS ON THE
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SCHOOL.
I WAS IN MY LAW CLASS, AND WE
WERE ACTUALLY STUDYING A CASE
LIKE THIS, ALL THIS STUFF.
THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF.
WE ACTUALLY EVACUATED THE
SCHOOL.
>> I WAS IN MATH CLASS.
I RAN OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.
THEY TOLD US TO KEEP ON GOING
STRAIGHT OUT OF, TO GO TOWARD
THE STREET.
>> I TEXTED MY MOM.
I LOOK BACK AT IT, "I THINK
SOMETHING IS WRONG, FIRE ALARM,"
AND IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND
WORSE.
IT WAS SO UNREAL.
>> A FRANTIC SEEN OUTSIDE OF A
FLORIDA HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.
A MAJOR POLICE RESPONSE OUTSIDE
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH IN THE
TOWN OF PARKLAND.
>> IT'S A BAD DREAM YOU WANT TO
WAKE UP FROM.
>> I HEARD LOUD GUNSHOTS, BUT I
LIKE NO ONE EVER THOUGHT THIS
WOULD HAPPEN AT DOUGLAS.
>> I HAD TO GO AND TALK TO THE
FBI.
I WAS ON WITH THE PHONE WITH MY
MOM TRYING TO FIND MEADOW, AND
HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND ME.
>> STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL
HAS BEEN UNDER LOCKDOWN AFTER
REPORTS OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER
SITUATION.
>> I ACTUALLY WASN'T GETTING
MEADOW TO ANSWER MY CALLS.
I WAS FREAKING OUT.
SHE WASN'T ANSWERING.
I KNEW MEADOW.
SHE'S ONE OF THE STRONGEST
PEOPLE I KNOW, THAT NOTHING
WOULD EVER HAPPEN TO HER.
I TRACKED HER PHONE, AND IT WAS
AT DOUGLAS.
I EXPECTED THE WORST.
I CALLED EVERY SINGLE PERSON I
KNEW.
THE ONLY PERSON I DIDN'T HEAR
FROM WAS MEADOW.
>> SHE WILL ALWAYS BE THE
STRONGEST PERSON I KNOW.
THERE WAS NO WAY SHE'D GO
WITHOUT A FIGHT.
>> INSIDE A FLORIDA HIGH SCHOOL
AS AN EXPELLED FORMER STUDENT
UNLEASHED A KILLING SPREE.
AT LEAST 217
AT LEAST 117
AT LEAST 177
AT LEAST 17 PEOPLE ARE DEAD.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MOVE
FORWARD FROM IT.
MEADOW WOULD SAY, CARLY, KEEP
GOING, KEEP GOING, DON'T GIVE
UP.
>> SEEING THE PEOPLE, EVEN
PEOPLE I DIDN'T LIKE, IN THE
SAME SITUATION AS ME, HAVING TO
SIT THERE AND DO ALL OF THAT, I
LOOKED AT THEM AND WE HUGGED.
THERE WAS NO HATE ANYMORE.
THERE WAS NOTHING.
WE CRIED TOGETHER, SAT THERE
TOGETHER.
IT SHOWED ME, WOW, WE'RE FINALLY
COMING TOGETHER.
IT'S SO SAD IT TO BE OVER THIS,
BUT IT'S HELPED US OUT, ALL OF
THIS A LOT.
>> WE'RE HERE FOR EACH OTHER.
>> GRADUATION WILL BE THE
HARDEST.
PROM WAS HARD, BUT GRADUATION
WAS MEADOW'S THING, WALKING THAT
STAGE.
I WILL BE PUTTING ON MY CAP,
LIKE A PICTURE OF HER, TO MAKE
SHE'S WALKING THAT STAGE WITH
HER, BECAUSE THIS IS HER BIG
DAY.
IT'S BOTH OUR BIG DAYS.
SHE WILL BE THERE WITH US.
>> I'M DOING MY CAP WITH MEADOW,
WITH A PICTURE OF HER, AND SO
WHEN I LOOK UP I SEE YOU.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A TATTOO
TOGETHER THAT ME AND CARLY GOT
TOGETHER.
WE SWORE WE'D NEVER GET A
TATTOO.
IT'S ON OUR LEFT ANKLE SO HE CAN
WALK THE STAGE WITH US.
>> NOTHING WILL BE NORMAL, BUT
EVERYONE BEING TOGETHER AS A
TEAM IS COMPLETELY NEEDED.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE TOGETHER IF
WE DON'T HAVE EACH OTHER, WE'LL
NEVER GET THROUGH THIS, NEVER
FIX IT.
>> REALLY HAPPY WITH HOW THE
SCHOOL HAS COME TOGETHER, BEEN
THERE FOR EACH OTHER WHEN WE
NEED EACH OTHER THE MOST.
>> THERE'S NO STOPPING.
LIFE KEEPS GOING ON.
LIVE IT FOR HER.
