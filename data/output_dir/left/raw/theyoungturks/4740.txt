1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,170
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT THE
REPUBLICANS WERE NOT DOING

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,730
ANYTHING ABOUT THE OPIATE CRISIS
IN AMERICA, THINK AGAIN.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,029
THEY ARE ACTUALLY PLANNING
SOMETHING MASSIVE.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,810
A MASSIVE CUT IN FEDERAL FUNDING
FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE ACROSS

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,430
THE COUNTRY WHICH SHOWS THAT
THEY CLEARLY WERE PAYING

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,750
ATTENTION TO NATIONAL ISSUES
DURING THE LAST ELECTION.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,230
THIS WILL ACTUALLY COME ABOUT AS
A NICE LITTLE SIDE EFFECT

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,519
OF THE AHCA PLAN, TRUMPCARE,
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,230
THE CUTS WOULD BE MADE TO
MEDICAID EXPANSION THAT

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,149
HAVE BEEN ONGOING SINCE THE ACA
WAS PUT INTO EFFECT.

11
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,200
THE GOP HEALTH CARE BILL WITHIN
THE EXTRA FUNDING STATES

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,690
GET THEIR EXPANDING MEDICAID IN
2020, AND PLACE A LIMIT ON

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,130
OVERALL FEDERAL SPENDING FOR THE
PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE.

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,750
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS,
WE'VE CITED THIS BEFORE AND

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,620
WE WILL AGAIN, THAT THE CBO
ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,560
14 MILLION PEOPLE WILL LOSE
THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,829
BECAUSE THEY GOT IT THROUGH THAT
PROCESS THAT WOULD BE ENDED.

18
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,450
THAT OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS EVERY
AREA OF THOSE PEOPLE'S

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,450
HEALTH INSURANCE BUT ONE AREA
THAT DOESN'T GET TALKED

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,760
ABOUT NEARLY AS MUCH IS THE
MEDICAID INFLUENCE ON

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,290
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT,
INCLUDING SOME OF THE MOST

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,409
DEADLY SUBSTANCES, THE OPIOIDS.

23
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,820
THE MEDICARE EXPANSION

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,829
ACCOUNTED FOR OVER 60%
ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN

25
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:15,499
KENTUCKY, NEARLY HALF IN WEST
VIRGINIA, NEARLY 60% IN

26
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:20,110
MICHIGAN AND MARYLAND AND ALMOST
A THIRD IN RHODE ISLAND.

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,210
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE PEOPLE GOT
YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE IN

28
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,630
THOSE STATES AND MANY OTHERS,
THROUGH THE MEDICAID

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,250
EXPANSION UNDER THE ACA, YOU
COULD FIND THAT ONCE TRUMPCARE

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,530
GETS PASSED, YOU SUDDENLY DON'T
HAVE THAT MONEY AND THAT IS

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,899
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THE SUBSTANCE
ABUSE TREATMENT IS NOT CHEAP.

32
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:38,570
ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT,
OUTPATIENT OPIOID ADDICTION

33
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,719
TREATMENT THAT INCLUDES
MEDICATION LIKE METHADONE

34
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,729
AVERAGES BETWEEN SIX AND $8000
A YEAR AND IF YOU ARE PAYING

35
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,289
OUT OF POCKET AND USING THE MOST
EFFECTIVE MEDICINES WHICH

36
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,799
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE, YOU WILL
PAY FAR MORE AND THAT MEANS

37
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,549
THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT GET THE
TREATMENT OF THEIR GETTING

38
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,380
RIGHT NOW WHICH MEANS THAT WE
WILL HAVE MORE DEATHS.

39
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,700
CLICKS ON THE UPSIDE, ON THE
FLIPSIDE NOT THE UPSIDE,

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,799
MANY PEOPLE WITH HAIR WHEN
ADDICTIONS ARE QUITE

41
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,450
WELL-OFF, SO THEY WILL BE FINE
I GUESS DOUG LIKES THIS

42
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,199
WOULD'VE BEEN BAD NEWS FOR RUSH
LIMBAUGH I GUESS.

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,310
HE WILL PROBABLY BE OKAY
WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT'S

44
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,310
PART OF HIS CONTRACT

45
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,330
IS GOOD THAT WE FINALLY GET
SOME DETAILS BECAUSE LOOK,

46
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,340
THESE GUYS, AS I HAVE SAID AND
YOU GUYS AGREE, AND I THINK

47
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,140
EVERYBODY PAYING ATTENTION,
THESE GUYS ARE NOT

48
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,340
INTERESTED IN GOVERNING.

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,270
I
SAY THIS ALL THE TIME, THEY

50
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,280
ARE INTERESTED IN UNDOING
GOVERNMENT.

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,700
INITIALLY, TRUMP PROPOSED THAT
AFTER RUNNING SOME OF HIS

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,080
CAMPAIGN ON HOW HE WOULD FIGHT
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC WHICH

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,750
IS SORT OF ODDLY BECAME, OR
SURPRISINGLY, AND WELCOMELY.

54
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,570
BECAME A CAMPAIGN ISSUE
THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND

55
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,210
BERNIE SANDERS AND DONALD TRUMP
EVEN ADDRESSED THE

56
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,030
AND KASICH AS WELL.

57
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,190
IT BECAME AN ISSUE THAT A
NUMBER OF CANDIDATES

58
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,310
ADDRESSED IT, AND TRUMP AND JOHN
KASICH AS WELL.

59
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,260
WHERE THEY SAID IT IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE IT'S A

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,380
BIG ISSUE.

61
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,290
ADMINISTRATION WAS INITIALLY
GOING TO DO A 95% CUT.

62
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,380
IT'S NOT, ONE OF THE EARLY CUTS.

63
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,130
TOTALLY DEFUNDING A FEDERAL
DRUG CONTROL OFFICE IN THE

64
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,390
MIDDLE OF A NATIONWIDE OPIOID
EPIDEMIC.

65
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,140
THERE WAS OUTCRY FROM MANY
REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS,

66
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,810
INCLUDING SOME FEDERAL
REPUBLICANS AND EVERY

67
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,560
DEMOCRAT COMPLAINING AND THEN
THEY BACKPEDALED AND THEY

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,170
ENDED UP PROPOSING 369 MILLION
FOR THE OFFICE.

69
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,610
IT IS NOT THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF
BEING ABLE TO FIGHT OPIOID

70
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,900
EPIDEMIC, BUT IS A CENTRAL
OFFICE WHICH CAN COORDINATE

71
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,730
AND IF DONE RIGHT WOULD BE
USEFUL, SO THEY END UP

72
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,840
BACKPEDALING OFF THEIR 95% CUT
WINCHESTER CONEY AND IN CRUEL

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,020
AND AGAIN JUST SHOWS A DESIRE,
LET'S STOP THIS DEPARTMENT.

74
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,420
LET'S NOT GOVERN HERE.

75
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,940
SO THEIR NEW PROPOSAL WAS 369
MILLION WHICH THEY MADE.

76
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,180
IT'S A 5% CUT.

77
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,819
THAT IS NOT TACKLING A PROBLEM.

78
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:12,410
THAT IS, THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC
BROKE THAT TACKLE AND

79
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,410
SLIPPED AWAY.

80
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,830
IT'S A FOOTBALL REFERENCE, JOHN.

81
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,279
THEY ARE GOING INTO GETTING
CREDIT TO SOME EXTENT FOR A

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,270
5% CUT IN WHAT IS CLEARLY A
NATIONAL CRISIS.

83
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,700
AND IT WAS SOMETHING, THESE
NUMBERS WERE OBVIOUSLY UP

84
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,580
TO DURING THE PREVIOUS EIGHT
YEARS TO THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY

85
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,900
AND THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN WORSE
AND WHAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH IS

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,700
SORT OF THE CONTINUATION THAT IS
TRICKLE-DOWN TO THE CONGRESS TO.

87
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,520
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO SEEMS TO
STILL BE, IN MY ESTIMATION,

88
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,660
PASTED THAT BARACK OBAMA MADE A
BUNCH OF JOKES ABOUT HIM AT

89
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,970
THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS
DINNER AND IS TRYING TO

90
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,310
UNDO EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
IN THE EIGHT YEARS OF THE

91
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,010
OBAMA PRESIDENCY.

92
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,380
I THINK A LOT OF THE WEIGHT OF
THE CONGRESS IS RUNNING IS

93
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,380
THE SAME WAY.

94
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,760
THEY SAID NO TO WHEN IT WAS
PROPOSED ANOTHER WANT TO

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,202
UNDO WHATEVER IS THERE IN THE
WRONG PLACES.

96
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,202
A SAD THING IS, THE OPIATE
EPIDEMIC IS SOMETHING THAT

97
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,202
IS AN EPIDEMIC.

98
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,202
IT AFFECTS BASICALLY EVERY
SEGMENT OF THE AMERICAN

99
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:05,202
POPULATION, BUT THIS ISN'T LIKE
THE CRACK PROBLEM WHERE

100
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:06,202
REPUBLICANS CAN SORT OF TELL
THEMSELVES THAT THAT IS

101
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,202
JUST A PROBLEM FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

102
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:08,202
HOW MANY TRUMP VOTERS,
ENTHUSIASTIC TRUMP

103
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:09,202
SUPPORTERS, WILL BE AFFECTED BY
THIS IF THIS GOES INTO EFFECT?

104
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:10,202
POOR, WHITE CONSERVATIVES THAT
THEORETICALLY COULD USE

105
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:11,202
THEIR LOSE THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE, STAY ADDICTED

106
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:12,202
AND POSSIBLY DIE UNNECESSARILY
BECAUSE OF WHAT REPUBLICANS

107
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:13,202
ARE WORKING THEIR BUTTS OFF IN
SECRET RIGHT NOW TO ACHIEVE.

108
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:14,202
YOU SORT OF EXPECT THAT THE
OTHER SIDE IS GOING TO GET

109
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:15,202
SCREWED IN AMERICAN POLITICS BUT
WHEN THEY ARE SO ENTHUSIASTIC

110
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:16,202
ABOUT SCREWING THEIR OWN VOTERS,
THAT IS SORT OF PERVERSE.

111
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:17,202
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS TO
BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S NOT

112
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,202
JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE PEOPLE STAY FOCUSED ON

113
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,202
THAT HCA IN THE BAIT THAT IS
COMING ON IN THE CENTAGE

114
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,202
CENTER ARE THE ONE THAT SHOULD
BE GOING ON.

115
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,202
LET'S SHOW THIS CHART.

116
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:22,202
WE
SHOWED IT ORIGINALLY BUT I

117
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:23,202
WANT TO SHOW IT AGAIN.

118
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:24,202
DRUG-INDUCED DEATHS.

119
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:25,202
OPIOIDS ARE NOT THE ONLY
COMPONENT OF THAT BUT THEY

120
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:26,202
ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST COMPONENT
OF THAT.

121
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,230
OPIOIDS THEORETICALLY, OKAY,
THEYíRE DANGEROUS AND THEY'RE

122
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,580
ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME DEATHS.

123
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,300
BUT THE RISE, THAT IS BECAUSE OF
THE PROFIT MOTIVE AND IT IS

124
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,480
EASY FOR MANY PEOPLE I THINK YOU
HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THIS,

125
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,370
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN THEIR
IMMEDIATE FAMILY WHO HAS

126
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,510
EITHER COME I THINK IT IS A
SHRINKING PERCENTAGE OF THE

127
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,900
AMERICAN POPULATION BUT THERE
ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT

128
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,790
THAT AND SAY, AT THE END OF THE
DAY, IT IS NOT MARIJUANA OR

129
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,180
CRACK BUT IT IS STILL DRUGS AND
THESE PEOPLE THEORETICALLY

130
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,300
COULD'VE JUST UP DOING IT.

131
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,280
BUT YOU GET ON IT BECAUSE YOU
HEART YOUR BACK OR YOU HURT

132
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,910
YOUR LEG OR SOMETHING, AND
THEN THE HUMAN ABILITY TO

133
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,790
OVERCOME THAT ADDICTION, THESE
ARE INCREDIBLY STRONG,

134
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,400
INCREDIBLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES.

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,750
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF

136
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
WILLPOWER.

137
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,040
IT IS NOT PUT DOWN
THE MUFFIN.

138
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,960
THIS BREAKS DOWN YOUR BODY'S
ABILITY TO STOP,

139
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,490
WHICH BY THE WAY, I CAN'T DO
THAT.

140
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,720
I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT.

141
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,449
I HAVE NEVER HAD A DRUG LIKE
THIS, I IMAGINE I WOULD BE

142
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,180
ADDICTED AND THAT IS WHY YOU SEE THE
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE DYING

143
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,880
SHOOTING UP.

144
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,250
THAT IS A TREND THAT MIGHT
CONTINUE, MIGHT ACCELERATE

145
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,250
TRUMPCARE GETS PUT INTO LAW.

146
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,250
OF COURSE, WHAT THAT
NUMBER IS 60,000,

147
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,250
52,000 LIVES NATIONALLY.

148
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,250
55.

149
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,250
I AM READING

150
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,250
I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY HIRED
OUR

151
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,250
I'M LOOKING AT 15 NUMBERS.

152
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,250
I THINK IT WAS 59,000 LAST
YEAR.

153
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,250
60,000, AND HERE'S WHAT
HAPPENED.

154
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,480
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T DIE BUT
THEIR LIVES WERE RUINED.

155
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
MANY MORE THAN 60,000.

156
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
NOT TO MENTION ñ

157
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
DON'T MENTION IT.

158
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,750
I SAID I WOULDN'T SO I WON'T.
DON AHCA STUFF, YOU

159
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,630
HAVE MORE ON IT BUT THE POLITICS
OF IT THAT SEEM TO GET A LITTLE

160
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,440
BIT MORE FAVORABLE TODAY AS A
NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS

161
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,790
LEAVING THEIR WEEKLY LUNCH WITH
AHAB ON CAPITOL HILL ON

162
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,949
TUESDAY WERE TELLING REPORTERS
THAT THERE AREN'T GUESTS

163
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:01,949
BOTH ON THIS.

164
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,210
MANY MORE ARE UNDECIDED THAN
THEY THOUGHT, AND ONE REPORTER

165
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,130
COUNTED SEVEN NO VOTES FROM
PUBLICANS ON THIS WHICH

166
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,930
WOULD DO IT IN AS OF RIGHT NOW.

167
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,540
THEY ARE NAMES YOU WOULD EXPECT.

168
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,160
JOHN MCCAIN SAID HE WASN'T SURE.

169
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
HE HATES THE PROCESS.

170
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,449
AND JOHN CORNYN, YOU WOULDN'T
EXPECT HIM, AND IN SOME OF

171
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,350
THE OTHER NAMES THAT COME OUT OF
THERE, SUSAN COLLINS YOU WOULD.

172
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:27,479
DEAN HELLER RUNNING FOR OFFICE
NEXT YEAR AND A BLUE STATE.

173
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,430
SHELLEY MOORE CAPITAL, TED CRUZ
AND MIKE LEE ARE NAMES THAT

174
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,919
ARE BEING SAID IS UNDECIDED THAT
ROB PORTMAN, UNDECIDED.

175
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,750
THESE ARE IMPRESSIVE NAMES.

176
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,750
I THINK THAT THE BACKLASH THAT
THEY HAVE GOTTEN FOR THE PROCESS

177
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,750
AND STORIES LIKE THIS AND WHAT
PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT IT

178
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,750
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME
PRESIDENTIAL BEDS ON

179
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,750
OLD-SCHOOL THIS WEEK WHICH I'M
SURE YOU BOTH WANT TO BE IN ON.

180
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,750
I CAN'T DO OLD-SCHOOL THIS
WEEK THAT

181
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,750
WILL BE CAN STILL INCLUDE
YOU.

182
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,750
WE WANT TO DO A DRAFT.

183
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,750
QUITE SALTY WITH OUR

184
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,750
IT IS GOING TO BE A DRAFT, I
HOPE I'M NOT GIVING TOO MUCH

185
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,750
AWAY, BUT A DRAFT OF THE PEOPLE
WHO MIKE PENCE WILL ASK TO

186
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,750
BE HIS VICE PRESIDENT, NOT ON
THE CAMPAIGN BUT WHEN HE

187
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,750
HAS TO APPOINT A VICE PRESIDENT.

188
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,750
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THAT
GAME.

189
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,750
I BRING UP JOHN KORMAN NOW
BECAUSE HE CAME UP AS A THOUGHT

190
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,750
AND THAT ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT, BUT -
I WILL JUST SIMPLY OFFER

191
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,750
EITHER OF YOU A VERY SIMPLE FIVE
DOLLAR BULL IF JOHN

192
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,750
CORNYN VOTE YES ON THIS DEAL.

193
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,750
ITíS INTERESTING.

194
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,750
I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD
PUT HIM ON THE MOST LIKELY TO

195
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,750
SING ON THE LIST, I WOULD THINK
HE WOULD BE IN THE BOTTOM 50%.

196
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,750
I CAN'T DO IT THAT

197
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,750
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TODAY.

198
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,750
NOTE THAT SO THAT IS LIKE, BUT

199
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,750
HE IS NOT CONFIDENT.

200
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,750
THIS
COULD BE FIVE DOLLARS, IF

201
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,750
IF VOTES NO, NOTHING IF HE VOTES
YES.

202
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,750
THAT IS A GOOD BET.

203
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,750
I WILL SAY, I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THOSE NOíS.

204
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,750
THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

205
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,750
SOME OF THEM ARE UNDECIDEDS,
NOT NOíS.

206
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,750
THAT IS GOOD NEWS AND IT
SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE ODDS

207
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,750
ARE NOT AS HIGH AS WE MIGHT'VE
THOUGHT.

208
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,750
NOT SAYING YOU'RE

209
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,750
DOING THIS, BUT I DO REMEMBER IN
THE SAME WAY I'M DOING A SOLID

210
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,750
TWO WEEKS OF EVERYDAY WE HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT TODAY HCA SAID PEOPLE

211
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
WILL REALIZE HOW DEVASTATING IT
WILL BE WHEN IT PASSES, BACK

212
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,750
WHEN THE HOUSE WAS CONSIDERING
IT FOR THE SECOND TIME, BECAUSE YOUíLL

213
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,750
REMEMBER IT CAME UP AND WAS KILLED
AND CAME BACK, I DID A STORY

214
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,750
BECAUSE WE WERE DOING A SOLID
WEEK OF IT AND THERE WAS A TYT

215
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,750
HOST, I AM NOT GOING TO SAY WHO,
WHO WAS ON THE PANEL AND SAID,

216
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,750
WHY EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS.

217
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,750
IT IS NOT GOING TO PASS.

218
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,750
WITHIN TWO DAYS, THEY SHIPPED IT
TO THE HOUSE AND IT PASSED.

219
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,750
DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED,
YOU CAN STILL PUT PRESSURE

220
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,750
ON YOUR SENATORS AND TRACK
DOWN THE SEVEN THAT WERE

221
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,750
MENTIONED BY MICHAEL AND
HOPEFULLY STOP THIS THING.

222
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,750
THERE IS ALSO NO FREEDOM
CAUCUS IN THE SENATE

223
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,750
WHICH DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN
THE HOUSE.

224
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,750
THERE WAS ONE OTHER ASPECT
WHEN WE KNOW ALMOST NOTHING

225
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,750
ABOUT THE SENATE VERSION OF THE
AHCA.

226
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,750
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

227
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,750
THAT THEY'RE GOING IN A BACK
ROOM AND PLAYING MARIO KART.

228
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,750
BUT WE ACTUALLY KNOW?

229
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,750
I DON'T KNOW.

230
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,750
THEY ARE NOT DOING THAT
BECAUSE THEY ARE ADULTS.

231
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,750
ADULTS DON'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

232
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,750
WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE
INFORMATION THAT AXIAL'S

233
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM.

234
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,750
ONE OF THE AREAS OF THE HOUSE
VERSION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD

235
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,750
A PROBLEM WITH AND WAS
PERVERSELY THE THING THAT GOT A

236
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
LOT OF THE CONSERVATIVES ON
BOARD WAS THE STATE WAIVERS FOR

237
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,750
SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS UNDER
THE ACA, THAT STATES COULD OPT

238
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,750
OUT OF THE THINGS ABOUT ACA THAT
MAKE IT WORTH A DAMN AND NOW WE

239
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,750
KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT
WILL BE IN THE SENATE VERSION,

240
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,750
WAIVERS ESTATES CAN GET FOR
LITTLE THINGS, LIKE PROVIDING

241
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,750
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS OR
THE LIST OF 10

242
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,750
THE SERVICES INSURERS MUST
COVER.

243
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS WILL
NOT BE INSURED, PROBABLY

244
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,750
NOT THAT ESSENTIAL ANYWAY.

245
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,750
DO WE KNOW WHAT SOME OF THOSE
ESSENTIAL BENEFITS ARE?

246
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,750
YEAH, I THINK SOME OF THESE
ARE.

247
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,750
THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO OR THE
REGULATION OF HOW MUCH

248
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,750
PREMIUM INCOME INSURANCE MUST
CLAIM SIN ON PATIENT

249
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,750
CLAIMS, SO THEM DOING THEIR JOB
AS INSURERS TRYING TO MAKE SURE

250
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,750
THE PEOPLE GET MEDICAL CARE WILL
BE A LOWER PRIORITY AFTER THIS.

251
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,750
DAYTRADING BAND.

252
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,750
THIS GOING TO BE BORING, I
APOLOGIZE BUT IT'S

253
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,750
IMPORTANT THAT THE REQUIREMENT
THAT PREMIUMS FOR OLDER

254
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
PEOPLE BE NO MORE THAN THREE
TIMES THE PREMIUMS CHARGED

255
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,750
TO LIGHT YOUNGER PEOPLE WHICH I
ALWAYS LOVE WHEN YOU WENT

256
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,750
ON ELECTION, YOU GAIN CONTROL OF
EVERY BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, AND

257
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,750
THEN YOU GIVE A MASSIVE MIDDLE
FINGER TO THE OLDEST VOTERS.

258
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,750
DO OLDER PEOPLE VOTE, I DON'T
KNOW MAYBE THEY DO.

259
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,750
BUT NOW THREE TIMES AS MUCH IS
ENOUGH.

260
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,750
OLDER PEOPLE COULD GET FIVE OR
10 TIMES AS COSTLY INSURANCE.

261
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,750
BILL SELF REGULATE AND KEEP
IT TO 3.

262
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
WHY RAISE A?

263
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,750
AND LET'S JUMP TO THIS LAST
GRAPHIC.

264
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,750
YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HOW MUCH
YOU THEORETICALLY COULD HAVE TO

265
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,750
PAY FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL
PROCEDURES OR CONDITIONS UNDER

266
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,750
THIS NEW PLAN THAT IS BEING
CONSIDERED.

267
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,750
IT'S A GREAT BANNER.

268
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,750
YOU ARE SEEING THERE,
INTERESTINGLY, WE JUST

269
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,750
ABOUT DRUG DEPENDENCY.

270
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,750
IMAGINE HAVING TO PAY AN
ADDITIONAL $20,000

271
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,750
FOR THAT IF THE STATES TAKE THE
WAIVER.

272
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,750
SOMETHING LIKE, I DO KNOW THAT
IS, MAYBE IT IS A CANCER.

273
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,750
PREGNANCY, IT IS PROBABLY
BETTER, BUT IF YOU GET A

274
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,750
17,000 ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN
SOUP CERTAIN STATES YOU MAY

275
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
HAVE TO PAY.

276
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,750
THE PERSON, THAT IS A BIG
PROBLEM IN AMERICA, 10K.

277
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,750
THAT IS EXPENSIVE.

278
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,750
HEMOPHILIA, $344,000 IN CERTAIN
FORMS OF CANCER, LUNG,

279
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,750
BREAST, I'M SURE EVERYONE
WATCHING THIS KNOW SOMEONE

280
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,750
WHO IS SUFFERED FROM A FORM OF
CANCER.

281
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,750
MS ON TOP OF ALL OF THE OTHER
PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH

282
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,750
THAT, ALSO HAVING TO PAY 30 TO
8000 THOUSAND DOLLARS.

283
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,190
I HOPE IN THIS BILL FINALLY
GIVEN THE LIGHT OF DAY, AND

284
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,310
IT MAY WELL BE AFTER IT PASSES,
IT BECOMES LAW, BUT JUST

285
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,050
FROM A POLITICAL POINT, THAT
BREAST CANCER IS INCLUDED

286
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,860
IN THE THINGS THEY WON'T COVER
BUT PROSTATE CANCER IS.

287
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,050
THAT WOULD FIT THE PATTERN.

288
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,580
THAT WOULD WORK.

289
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,500
THEY GO TO THE CBO, THIS GOES TO
THE CBO NEXT WEEK.

290
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,380
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT THEY WILL CERTAINLY

291
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,380
LOOK AT THAT

292
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,380
EXACTLY.

293
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,080
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY ARE
GOING TO TRY TO VOTE BY

294
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,430
THURSDAY, SO HOW MUCH TIME ARE
WE GOING TO HAVE BETWEEN

295
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,399
THE CBO REPORT COMING OUT, AND
THE VOTE.

296
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,010
A DAY MAYBE THAT

297
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,380
DOES A GO TO THE CBO AND THEY
BOTH THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK

298
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
WITH THE

299
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,380
THAT IS WHAT I HEARD THE

300
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,630
THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT THAT IT IS IMPORTANT

301
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,210
TO BEGIN THIS INFORMATION OUT
NOW, BECAUSE IF THERE IS

302
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,120
LESS THAN A DAY FOR PEOPLE TO
PUT PRESSURE AND AN THAT IS

303
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,220
WHEN PEOPLE FINALLY AWAKEN, WHEN
THEY WEEK UP TO HOW TERRIBLE

304
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,970
THIS BILL COULD BE, I DON'T KNOW
THE THEORETICALLY THAT'S

305
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,490
ENOUGH TIME TO STOP IT SO PEOPLE
NEED TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM

306
00:10:18,490 --> 00:00:00,000
NOW AND THEY NEED TO NOT RELENT
UNTIL IT IS ACTUALLY KILLED.
