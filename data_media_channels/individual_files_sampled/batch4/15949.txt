Girl Guides the UK version of Girl Scouts no longer cares if you can master important life skills more details on that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel raise your hand if you were a Girl Scout me I was and I loved it until they wouldn't let me bring my discman on a camping trip and that's when I said peace out now I realized that was a very bratty move but I did learn a lot up until that point a lot of valuable lessons that Girl Scouts teaches like teamwork being prepared the Golden Rule leadership and tangible skills like building a fire keeping financial records touching you learn business and marketing skills selling those cookies and with all of those patches on your vests in your sash you learn the art of the humble brag now Girl Scouts was awesome and I imagine the British version of Girl Scouts Girl Guides was once similarly awesome unfortunately they have both morphed into something that I don't recognize anymore as reported by the Daily Mail UK Girl Guides are doing away with some as they believe antiquated patches and replacing them with newer more modern skilled patches to passionates that they will be doing away with one is the hostess patch which a southern girl like me who values hospitality and being the hostess with the mostess this is particularly depressing now my mother is the most spectacular hostess there has ever been and she tried to instill those skills in me and believe me it is a skill to be learned and I would really think that Brits with their social mores and decorum would still value the skill of hosting another patch would be operating a radio now this one I don't know maybe it is a little bit outdated but the nostalgic side of me the little girl in me who sat in my dad's lap in a big rig as he taught me how to use a CB radio and tuner that side of me is weeping a little now in lieu of the old patches there will be new ones falling under six categories express myself be well know myself skills for my future have adventures and take action now I'm cool with all of that but it's the specific patches upset my apple cart and put a bee in my bloomers one patch is for the skill of mixology yes for an organization that caters to ten to fourteen year olds mixology is a skill granted they're not making martinis they're using juices and herbs and spices to make non-alcoholic drinks but hello this sounds like a gateway to alcoholism to me I wonder if they are going to replace the badge for starting a new fire with lighting a joint who knows another skill for which you can receive a patch is media critic where girls are taught how to identify bias and look for gender stereotypes and media so basically they're training girls to be overly sensitive identity politics driven doilies I say doing these because I think that snowflake is played out a little and doilies are pretty feeble too and useless so very appropriate for Girl Guide Rangers age 14 and up there's protest badges so what exactly is being taught here what's what skills are required to show up somewhere with us some large handwritten sign barking about something you have no knowledge of it's just the trending topic on Twitter and that hot guy from your biology class said in his snapshot then he was gonna go now you know what ancient skill would help if you actually wanted to exact change writing a damn letter to your Congressman or Member of Parliament but I doubt these girls can even properly write with a pen and paper since all they need to communicate nowadays are thumbs speaking of thumbs and texting all your friends who are dying to go to that indie music festival festival-goer is a patch I'm not kidding this is where you learn how to go to your first festival and oh yeah there's a vlogging patch up cycling which is turning trash into art and mindfulness aka and meditation and being present mmm namaste other patches they are dishing our bird watcher man laundress because mom can't do your laundry forever chica pioneer knitter rabbit keeper what bell ringer I don't know what do you think and for all of you UK rebels out there are you outraged over this are you outraged enough to pull your daughter out of the organization now I hope by the time I have that there is a suitable and sufficient alternative but we'll see let us know thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
