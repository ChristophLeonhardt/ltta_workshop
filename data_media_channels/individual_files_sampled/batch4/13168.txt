the other thing I have to say that I hate today Jude here is a an alleged journalist over at the Atlantic and he tweeted this out in the aftermath of some allegations that were that were dumped yesterday so Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee released a Cavanaugh Investigative summary that included in an anonymous claim of rape forward by Kemal Harris's office that turned out to be complete nonsense two interviews in a written statement from a man who believes that he not Cavanaugh actually was responsible for the assault and so jeet here tweeted out it's incredibly irresponsible to release this stuff a dump of raw gossip with only the intent of muddying the waters apparently mirrors are illegal over at the Atlantic what do you think the last several weeks have been okay this is raw gossip or personal accounts with the intent of muddying the water okay particularly this week put aside Blasi fort who again has no corroboration for her statements this week we've seen several attempts at muddy in the water's coming from Michael avenatti coming from The New Yorker all of it uncorroborated all of it raw gossip intent at muddying the waters but apparently it only applies to one side of the aisle this is what's so irritating about all this none of this is really an attempt to get down to who should be on the Supreme Court or standards of proof none of this is really an attempt to get down to even the basic truth of what happened because there's no way to do that without corroborating evidence all of this is political and anybody who tells you difference is lying to your face
