in your business you're essentially the product people are unbelievably critical of you and everybody in the media no matter what you do you're going to people screaming at you all the time obviously anybody running a business with any sort of product you're going to have customer outcry and so forth how do you figure out what to listen to what not to listen to how do you get a thick enough skin that when people say the worst possible things about you you just go on well you know it's interesting because I think that over the years I have gotten better at this but when you are in the public eye and you live in a fishbowl like I feel like I do people will always have commentary about who you are what kind of a person you are what you look like we I used to get you know we used to have a segment on CNBC called buy seller hold and people would call up and ask for stock picks but before they would ask my guest by seller hole they would say to me things like Maria congratulations on the baby you know you're having a baby you're pregnant I've never been pregnant you know I mean I I must have gained 5 or 10 pounds and it's mortifying um but you know that was sort of hurtful I know it wasn't coming from a bad place it wasn't intentional but you know it some people will say to me you know what you look better in person you know or oh my god you look so tired today and if you weren't on TV and sort of out there you would never say that to a person I would never say to you hey you know you look exhausted today but people just feel like because they wake up with you they go to sleep with you you're on their TV or in their living room that they're your buddies and they could say whatever you want I'm flattered and I feel humbled and really privileged to be in that position but I also know that as my mom says you have to have alligator skin can't believe the good stuff and you certainly can't believe the bad stuff and that's what I've come to accept so when I see someone says something that's about me in a magazine or anywhere I probably won't read it because I don't want to get to a place where I'm believing my own press releases I need to stay even-keeled and with my feet on the ground and recognize that my success is a result of a lot of support from people hard work there are no shortcuts and loving what I do but you can Zuma learn from some criticism when you say you've blown it in the past you learn from that so how do you separate the two well I think that you have to read into what someone is saying or writing and ask yourself some some real truths you know does this whole truth is this right you know does he have a point and I think it's important to do that regularly to assess how you are living your life one of the laws in the book is integrity and I think at the end of the day you know we all know what the right thing to do is when we're faced with a dilemma and you know people want to be around integrity they want to associate themselves with integrity you can be incredibly successful and not have integrity but you can't be successful truly successful without integrity I believe
