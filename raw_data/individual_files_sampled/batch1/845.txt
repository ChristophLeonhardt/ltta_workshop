I would like to ask you first what is the broader message that the committee is putting out here in giving this award to these two people the broader message is to highlight that the abuses that women suffer in wars and other conflicts is not only individual atrocities but that it is used systematically as a weapon that's one message the second message is that this weapon is unlawful and the third message is that people do have to realize and listen to the stories how awful these acts are in fact and this is also what can end war there to visualize the suffering and the brutality of what goes on and that it has to end and that impunity has to end that such atrocity will atrocities will have to be investigated as war crimes and perpetrators brought to justice and indeed both of these people have furthered those ends from different ends of the perspective definitely they represent different conflicts different regions McCrea has for many years treated victims of atrocities but he has also been very vocal in Congo and internationally exactly by saying justice is everyone's business and that really pinpoints it and it's the business of the national state where the atrocities have taken place but it's also the business of international community and what is unique with Nadia Murad is that she has had the courage as a victim to speak up and tell the story of what actually happened to her because in most cases the stigma of being a victim of such crimes is so strong that women feel they just cannot speak up and tell the world what happened so one is the helper the other is the victim as you pointed out earlier ma'am this is a year in which sexual violence in society by the me2 movement has touched the Nobel Foundation as well are there parallels in any way between sexual violence as a weapon of war and sexual violence in society than me to movement in this case I would like to say that there is a fundamental difference between war crime and got me to addresses there is violence in society at large unfortunately I'm a criminal lawyer I know that very well but in fairness there's a fundamental difference between such violence and war crimes you know where people kill each other and shoot each other in a total lawless context so I think one should not pull the parallel too far but there is of course a parallel why are women always vulnerable in war and why is this weapon mostly not always but mostly used against women it has something to do with the role of women in the society before the conflict came there before the war was a fact that a woman is vulnerable in such a situation women are usually not high-level politicians they usually do not lead armies and they are sometimes with mostly not soldiers so these it's not totally isolated from problems in civil society but I do think it's important to say that the significance of the war crime is different than the problems we have in civil society finally another element of controversy at the Peace Prize we know is no stranger to controversy anxiety she was awarded the prize in 1991 they've been calls to strip her of it particularly this year is there a sense in which the committee has felt the need this year to play it a little safe Trump was mooted as a possible winner kim jongwan these two very worthy winners are likely to be very uncontroversial was that deliberate in any way I asked we believe that we make our decision on the mandate we have in Alfred Nobel's well sometimes our decisions are very controversial sometimes they are not but being not controversial does not reduce the importance of the price because I believe this is a very important price and it can address what is in fact going on in conflicts all over the world including the rengar situation and highlight the suffering of these victims who otherwise have been anonymous to the attention of the international community I think this is also an example that legal instrument was created first in 1998 it is an example of activities international in the international community to make the situation of women politics and the business of all also the international community ma'am thank you for your time thank you
