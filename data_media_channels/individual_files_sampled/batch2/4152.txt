a ten term incumbent Democratic member of Congress from Massachusetts has lost his seat tonight in an upset win in a Democratic primary we turn to the great Steve Kornacki for more Steve what has happened this this is it ten terms it's stunning Michael Capuano losing to Ayane Presley a couple things to draw your attention to number one Michael Capuano you say ten terms think of it this way in 1998 when he was elected he won a 10-way Democratic primary with 22% of the vote never faced a serious challenge after that and then this year lo and behold city councilor from Boston Ayanna Presley runs against him there were not huge ideological differences in this race this was about the idea she did certainly position herself as being more aggressively anti-trump in Capuano but a lot of this too had to do with the changing demographic character the changing political character of this district how about this the history of this seat this is a historic seat in Congress the Capuano is held here is the lineage James Michael Curley John F Kennedy Tip O'Neill Joe Kennedy the second Michael Capuano and now this will be the first African American woman ever to represent Massachusetts in Congress Ayanna Presley this is an overwhelmingly democratic district by winning this primary she gives as g√∂del as elected in November from Tip O'Neill and James Michael Curley the Democratic Party now embracing Ayanna Presley as its new face in this district and Steve in terms of Ayane Presley's victory tonight we knew that she was endorsed by Mora he leaves the state AG is seen as a real rising star in democratic politics and a big deal in Massachusetts Democratic politics which of course has a Republican governor right Massachusetts this blue state with a very popular Republican governor Charlie Baker you say this is a sure thing does this reflect any other trends in terms of Massachusetts Democrats and endorsements and who she's associated with yeah well it's interesting because most have sort of the establishment in Massachusetts the Democrats they did rally around Capuano in this race and Maura Healey the AG and going with Presley she was more going on her own in that there were some other incumbents who were challenged in Massachusetts tonight it looks like they've survived Richard Neal the congressman from western mass Steve Lynch a more moderate even conservative Democrat from South Boston it looks like they've survived but Wow Mike Capuano 20 years in Congress never a serious challenge all of a sudden losses by double digits at this point Steve Kornacki thank you very much my friend much appreciated that does it for us tonight we'll see you again tomorrow now it's time for the last word with lawrence o'donnell good evening Rachel and you and Steve talking about my old neighborhoods tonight and that congressional race fine with me you could keep going you know I ran into a Jana Presley in Massachusetts a few weeks ago and she told me unofficially off the record that they had polling inside their campaign that was more positive than the public polling which showed her significantly behind and you know candidates always tell you that we say our private polls look better but she was very convincing about it and that district and in all the iterations that Steve was describing from when it was JFK's district to tip O'Neill's district up to kepanis district those borders have changed a lot of on that district in the way it weaves its way now around Boston through Boston but this is this is the new face of Boston it is it is an amazing and and kind of wonderful thing to see for someone like me who grew up in a strictly segregated City where this was impossible to see Michael cope wanna tonight give that concession when only about I think only 11 or 12 percent of the vote was in at this point we at the time he started conceding we didn't even have a call of the election from The Associated Press or anybody else but clearly when she told you that her polling was better than you might expect from the public information he must have been looking at some of that same stuff because they knew right out of the gate that they were toast and it looks like she's gonna win by a lot yeah and they were looking at neighborhoods that he was supposed to do much better in and they saw him getting crushed in neighborhoods that he was supposed to win and so it was a pretty obvious way to read it at that point but Rachel trying to squeeze this in in a Newsday that includes everything that it has included including your great interview with John Kerry this has been quite an hour that you've just been through and now I'm gonna try to squeeze an awful lot of stuff all right okay I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list see lots of other great videos
