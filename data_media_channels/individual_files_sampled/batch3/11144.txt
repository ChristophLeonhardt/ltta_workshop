I am a scholar this is the house report welcome it's time once again to get into the nitty gritty define in pity the ultimate expression what Stacey I have a confession to make we are actually in Mexico right now oh my god that's true we are in Mexico for the Satoshi roundtable and we have pre-recorded this so we're at the Satoshi roundtable talking about Bitcoin with all our fellow bitcoiners and I'm pre recording this so just in case the price has crashed zero or the price has gone to fifty thousand we don't know at the point that we're recording this but I do want to talk about this general headline here regarding Bitcoin and it reads nobody puts Bitcoin in the corner this is from ft Alphaville skadam super uber and he's written for coin desk and coin Telegraph and all these sorts online wired as well about cryptocurrencies and stuff and this has gotten a lot of attention because of this opening these three paragraphs that I want to talk about a very very fascinating way to put it suppose for a moment Bitcoin never existed and aetherium never existed and the whole crazy world of cryptocurrencies never happened someone comes along and tells you to imagine an electronic network for moving money anywhere in the world that no one owns it's an intriguing idea it's an unprecedented idea in the entirety of human history such a thing has literally never existed would your response really be lol the true value of Bitcoin is zero no no no this is the result of a lot of very smart people thinking about this for many many years about how to move value over the internet without encountering what's called a double spend problem that it's Center ship resistant that it's immutable it's gold 2.0 and it takes advantage of the asymptotic curve and costs in technologies for processing bandwidth and other elements chip speed and all approaching that price of zero which means you can have the blockchain moving never cheaper costs even though it's expanding in size because the economics of the Internet is crashing towards zero that's one of the phenomenon in economics that people like Paul Krugman don't understand as it applies to Bitcoin because he is used to things like increased returns economics based on diminishing returns and how that affects pricing and how that affects economics here we have increased returns where you have the basic raw material that is to say electrons and processing and moving them around is constantly going to zero but you're at the same time as infinite as that sounds the uniqueness of each Bitcoin with their only being 21 million is part of the intrigue that is this technology and this and this value system that is completely unique and at the result of thousands of years of technological progress hundreds of years of economic thought and a real true desirability to have a system that is completely outside central control well yeah it's important to understand whoever you're reading or what analysis to understand kind of where they're coming from and what their background is so Paul Krugman is a neoclassical economist and an ivory tower he lives in an ivory tower he's an academic there's nothing wrong with that this there's been ivory tower dwellers throughout history in India they have it codified into a class system a caste system he is an academic and he believes in the the righteousness of a hierarchy that you know one should get trained to a doctorate level and then you can tell the people you could teach people these poor students these ignorant students what what the truth is about economics so you know he comes from that sort of background where he believes elite no more and they should govern the economy politics culture so that's his background that's how he comes to Bitcoin on the other hand as this article points out there have been a lot of scamsters but that's attached to anything that is a store of value get any Clint Eastwood film throughout history it's all about some schmuck trying to steal some gold from somebody else and they all fight and kill each other and then you know some woman is gained as well during the whole thing and you know they make off of the gold somebody gets the gold at the end of the show but here he says there's a lot of that's dumb about crypto currencies the dumb seems to increase proportionally with the price every day some new idiot tries her luck on the ico roulette wheel and the hope of making a fortune of a lifetime for doing little more than writing a piece of paper and sticking a countdown clock on a website but there's a lot that's really profound and you need only look as far as Bitcoin to see that so he goes into the actual issue which gives it so much value which the likes of Paul Krugman messed and which you've just encapsulated where he says the problem of transferring or holding value digitally without permission is not a trivial one the fact the solution requires huge amounts of energy is just one sign of the difficulty the upshot of solving it however is you get an electronic network for value that governments cannot control or destroy except with significant financial and social costs even they might not succeed I mean you saw that with remember during the Arab Spring when in Egypt when Mubarak was overthrown and he tried to turn off the Internet and it worked for two or three days and all his cronies everybody liked that he had to turn a bag on he had to connect them back to the internet because it was it became impossible he was he was gonna be ousted no matter what at that point because he was either gonna crash the economy take everything down with it and all his friends and all his cronies or he was gonna have to turn it back on this barrier to entry for creating a coin is almost zero yam over a thousand coins and you have AI cos hundreds of probably more than a thousand icos and you know I liken it to I remember but I don't know if they even have us anymore but they used to have a form of a cosmetic product where you put this tape on your skin and it pulls out blackheads and you know the ease of the ways you can create a see out of nothing as has pulled out the blackheads there are a lot of dodgy characters and projects out there alongside the the internet just like you know there's been many false prophets and then there was let's say a Jesus for example you know and he ended up being worth something but you know let's go back to Sochi is a problem a lot of people are seeking profits but here you know again the internet which Paul Krugman missed and every time he tries to offer his opinion on Twitter about Bitcoin of course if you look at the tweet tweeted responses is all of pictures of fax machines because of course he said that the internet would have no impact on the global economy as much only as the fax machine ever did so he just thought it as a communication not a network and he clearly has some sort of blind spot to network effects and network impacts and you know and changing of the mind and and and certainly you were around during the first calm boom and at that time people you know that the markets investors went crazy and people thought pets calm ties calm shirt calm you know that was where it was all gonna go that was the way to make the fortunes and they didn't see social media they didn't see Twitter Facebook those all came along later right the the basic as I pointed out that that's missed is that the underlying fundamental building blocks of this economy are becoming cheaper every single day and it's a lot different than traditional economics where you have diminishing returns or you have the need you know if you're digging gold out of the ground it takes ever more energy to dig gold out of the ground now it does require more energy to mined coins but the ancillary markets themselves are popping up in a way that's almost exponential and dwarfing that underlying cost such as such a degree that the free money that's appearing in people's accounts that they can use then to go and do battle with the fiat money that is the result of coercion by a corrupt state is is quite remarkable I just want to also point out something about the first calm bubble yeah didn't you have some like seven-year-old pitch you and a knock-knock joke site yeah it was yeah that's right that the height of the dot-com bubble when I went to a conference and I sat next to it as a seven or ten year old kid who is launching knock-knock joke calm for a multi-million dollar valuation and it was the you know supreme knock-knock jokes that one could find and there was also duty dot-com as a daily drawing of defecation essentially hand drawn defecating Duty dot-com but those I SEOs equivalent yes Jason Calacanis about this Jason you remember duty calm knock-knock joke calm maybe that was and Jason was of course the king of the dot-com back then he's been come out he's against not against but he's been trying to sound the alert on the parallels between the dot-com in the ICL which is okay it's a fine analysis there is total excess in this space but the underlying technology like there were survivors and are the dot-com like Google and Facebook came a little later but this tangential eBay colossal yeah there's another thing going around which Vitalik Boucheron who is the founder of aetherium has been talking about and that's this notion of fair coin people are trying to figure a way to distribute coins better that was also an issue up at the Davos meeting I heard some analysis saying that there was a lot of talk about sovereign currencies because at that point at the time of Davos Venezuela has just announced a petro currency so this isn't something going forward that could be a possibilities he's sovereign currencies I don't know I haven't read the white paper yet on the petrol but I don't know if that's workable but I think in the future there could be something that is like you know they alas in Alaska if you're a resident of Alaska you receive some money every year it's like a thousand two thousand three thousand dollar check that comes in because you live in the state and the oil in the state produces a lot of oil so they get a share of that so there could be a way to distribute instead of having oligarchs and all they sort of a very wealthy few whether you know you're in an oil-rich country or mineral rich country if it just goes to a handful of people they get to you know some reason get the exclusive access to the assets of the nation that happened to lie under the nation you know this is a fair way to distribute the coins I'm already mentioned that the government in America subsidizes the energy industry tens of billions hundreds of billions probably trillion dollars of US government subsidization of the energy industry the US government could subsidize mining of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and put those into wallets called American citizens could each have an automatic wallet tied to their social security account and they could get a daily weekly or monthly airdrop of crypto coins that they can then use to boost the economy with the government can easily do that the government should do that I've said that many times and this would be a way to fairly distribute wealth and you know it's no reason why Wall Street that gets the subsidization of free money from the Fed why that's not shared equally amongst the entire population they can match that distribution of fair money from the Fed using crypto coins Visa be the social security account yeah I mean and one problem of course is you don't want just one airdrop like Aurora coins right for Iceland because there o is the Soviet problem because when the Soviet Union collapse they did give basically the equivalent of what an airdrop was is that every citizen got some sort of cut of the assets of the nation and it turned out that the Oleg arcs went around door-to-door knocking and collecting them all and bought them for cheap and then became controllers of the assets you know you want a dividend that keeps on coming in absolutely we can solve this Stasi right after the break we'll have it all figured out don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to go to Acapulco and speak with Jeff Berwick who puts on the biggest most anarchic conference in politics and economics that is in Acapulco in this year he's added a one-day crypto Poco Jeff welcome back is my pleasure max Jeff congratulations this in Acapulco crypto poco thing is blowing up man it's a must go to event right here about her all the time he must be very pleased yeah actually we've been totally shocked we were not expecting this we have about tripled the audience of last year it's going to be actually sold out it's going to be about 1,500 people we had about 600 last year and yeah it's peers that this anarchy thing is kind of popular all right if somebody showed up they couldn't get a ticket it's completely sold out yeah the main corporates are sold out but there's all kinds of events before and after it's it's almost like a month-long sort of event but so you can go to Newark koco.com and scroll down you can see all the workshops and you can also livestream the conference at an arco koco.com slash livestream so what a lot of people are doing is coming down and they're going to actually just sit by the pool and watch the conference on their iPad and then when the people all come out from after the conference and they all go to the parties and restaurants join them there all right cool man let's get into some of these recent developments in the Bitcoin space and you know let's talk a little bit about Bitcoin at Bitcoin cash you know as well as one or two Bitcoin maximalists we see are you staying away from that fight of Bitcoin versus Bitcoin cash or how do you weigh in on that one I know you're gonna have a couple of the Bitcoin cash people at the festival what are your thoughts on this Jeff yeah I definitely have not been staying away from this debate it actually took me a few months after the fork on August 1st to kind of understand what was going on it's not complex and technical and there's all kinds of different interests involved and this is what happens when you have a completely decentralized currency is there is a lot of disorganization there's a lot of fighting there's a as we know a Bitcoin cash forked off from Bitcoin on August first and that was generally a dispute about how to scale Bitcoin and that dispute is still very much still going on because Bitcoin transaction fees have been still very high and Bitcoin transaction speeds have been quite low and the main reason I got into Bitcoin was because I believe that if we could have a digital currency that is decentralized it will essentially get rid of central banks which will eventually massively downsize government's and even eventually get rid of governments and as Americus that's exactly what I want but the way the Bitcoin has developed and you see a lot of these Bitcoin core developers you see people at block stream these have been the block streams been one of the most active groups involved in this sort of thing and block stream is kind of half owned or owned by the chairman of Bilderberg so that's a lot of doubts about their intentions and you hear a lot of the Bitcoin core developers talking about it's okay if it costs a hundred dollars to transfer Bitcoin that just shows that it's it's really popular and that's not what I foresaw for Bitcoin when I first got into it in 2011 I foresaw that we need a currency that can be used by anyone in the world that is decentralized very cheap to use and very fast at least within a ten minutes or something along those lines at the very least and now we're seeing Bitcoin being moved to live scene transaction fees well over a hundred dollars I actually paid one transaction fee of over two thousand dollars once trying to transfer three bitcoins about two weeks ago now there is seg width there's Lightning Network there's all kinds of things we could talk about there but I also have my doubts about those and the main thing that I see is there are a lot of these techies don't really understand what really Bitcoin was created for and that was to become a currency used by everyone and they keep talking about it being digital gold now so it's not digital cash it's digital gold if so if Bitcoin ends up being digital gold and it can't be used very easily as cash then we're going to have to look at alternatives there's an ongoing debate I think the market is going to sort this out one way or another nothing is bigger than the market I know there's a lot of grumbling about Bitcoin cash kind of the name Bitcoin and by using Bitcoin dot-com as the gateway to Bitcoin cash causing a lot of what some would say unnecessary confusion in in the marketplace but let's move on to another crypto currency that you're involved with you're a very prominent poster at steam it and this is an interesting application Jeff because it's an old coin and the old coins came around during the period of scaling debates when and the delays in scaling that we've seen you know going back a few years and it really laid the foundation and created the room for these altcoins to blossom and steam is one of those alt coins but it also has a very specific use case and I always liked it I've talked about it before on this show it seems like a great use of tokens to incentivize content etc and you're a big a big guy on steam it can he tell folks about it yeah sure I got on to it about July 2016 I believe I didn't know anything about it and I made my first post and I because you can upvote and give steam to the best post on the site I made $15,000 on my first post because I'm quite well known in the cryptocurrency community and everyone at the time whose who was on Steam it was all into cryptocurrency so I started to learn about it and I found out that the developer was a person named Dan Larimer I really got into his concepts he's an anarcho-capitalist he's trying to create all of these sort of things cryptocurrencies and ways that we can essentially make governments and central banks obsolete and I got really the steam it and then he went on to move on to something called yose now EOS and I'm a big supporter of that as well but steam is one of the preferred for me personally it's the first use case of a crypto currency being used for something other than just a currency and so far it's going really well if people out there don't know about steam accom especially with what Facebook's doing now Facebook just banned all cryptocurrency and Bitcoin related posts and ads so you can see what's going on there steam it is a social media site based on the blockchain so once you post there no one can censor it it's on the blockchain essentially forever as long as that blockchain exists it is it could be the next level for social media alright Jeff let's get into some politics here because you've always been outspoken in your politics and obviously with an Acapulco and your push for anarchy and we've talked about this before and now with Bitcoin and crypto achieving certain mass adopted soar a certain level of adopting but it it's gotten to a point where Wall Street's running scared a little bit governments are running scared and they're pushing back they are Facebook as you point out is banning as for a crypto we're seeing gov India you know they were more positive toward Bitcoin now their negative torque Bitcoin so the the revolution that is Bitcoin has reached the state level and so this is really in your wheelhouse Jeff because you know you are I don't know how to describe this anti state I guess I mean so but so it's gotten to that level you know it's got to the Jeff Berwick fight you know so will the state have the tools what are the state what are the tools the states using to fight Bitcoin as you see it and how successful will they be to fight Bitcoin Jeff it's going to be very interesting this is a battle for the future of freedom for humanity if they win we will have tyranny on earth like we've never known it if we if we win we will have peace and prosperity on earth like we've never known it and give the power back to the people so really when Bitcoin came out that was the big thing because the real first step for the problems for people like for things like government was the internet for the first time people had access to information instead of the mainstream propaganda you get on things like NBC and CNN and Fox News and all the other ones that are like those and so people are there first time had access to information now Bitcoin has really hit at the root of their power structure because it's really the power behind these governments is their central banks you can't have many of the things that they do you can't have any of these wars without central banks they're all paid for through the inflation even Donald Trump that some people are for some reason excited about in the u.s. said he might reduce taxes somewhat but if you don't reduce the actual spending of the all you're doing is shifting that burden of those expenses on to the currency itself by printing more money to pay for it so this is what where it's at and this is a massive battle this is a colossal battle that really has just begun it just began really in the last two years as you pointed out now you see it talked about at Davos you see it at g20 s you see it everywhere because there's finally realizing this is really a major threat to their power structures and they will try to do many things to stop you pointed out many of them of course they'll put in as many of the laws as they can they'll try to outlawed you see in China some of the things that they've done they've sort of outlawed I SEOs but the great thing about all this stuff is you can't really stop it there is no place you can't go to Bitcoin and and find the CEO and put them in jail you can't go to the Bitcoin office and bring in your typical government swat teams and shut it down it doesn't really exist anywhere and this is the beauty and this is what it's going to be the battle and I don't I don't expect it to end for many years and I expect it to be very very bloody but not in terms of physical blood just in terms of a real struggle for this for what's going on for what we have complete tyranny complete government control global government as they're talking about one world government one world central bank or will the people finally have the power back and have a currency that gives the power back to the people yeah well there's two key technologies here that we've already seen the futility of trying to stop them one would be BitTorrent and all the torrent sites despite the Hollywood MPAA RIAA s best effort to stop file swapping and torrents they they have not been able to stop if they've had to change their models to accommodate the new reality second of all encryption itself is still in the the domain of the cypherpunks and and the people who support encryption as a means of privacy and for a means of self-governance and as a means of getting together for the the right to assemble so these things I'm not been defeated let me talk about another weapon in their toolbox however and that would be the Wall Street use of financial futures you know Bitcoin price was 20,000 or so and then they launched the financial futures contract than the CMA and we've recently traded at 7500 a lot of people say I think there's a correlation there because of all the games we've seen in the futures market you've been a long-term observer of markets as well as what we've seen in the gold and silver market over the years is that a fair assessment Jeff in your view do you see that connection you might find it funny to find out that I actually don't think that those features have severely affected Bitcoin at this point I've looked into the futures trading on the CM o e I believe it's called and the daily trading is around twenty million dollars or something and the Bitcoin market of course is a hundred billion dollar market so at this point I don't see that as being the reason for the fall I see other reasons for its I think we needed this fall if you look back one year ago Max and just look at the prices of these crypto currencies I believe Bitcoin even a year ago was still around under $1,000 I believe a year ago aetherium was around ten or twenty dollars it could have been a little higher now it's around $1,000 this has been a very hot space a lot of the money printed by central banks has actually been flowing into this space which is really interesting they're kind of half destroying themselves by printing this money and people putting that money into digital currencies but yes we'll see how much they can try to affect it through all the other means they have and some of those are things like futures for sure but I don't think it's affected it too much yet all right chef we gotta go thanks for being on the show Thank You max all right that's gonna do it for this episode of cons to report with me Max Keiser and Stacey I would like to thank our guest Jeff Berwick anarcho-punk oh and this year crypto cocoa in Acapulco what could possibly be more fun than that if you want to get in touch with us it's Kaiser report on Twitter until next time bye y'all
