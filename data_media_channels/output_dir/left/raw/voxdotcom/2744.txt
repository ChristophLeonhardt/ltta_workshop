1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,740
It's a care package for my mom

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,760
back home in Los Angeles.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,480
It's always filled with everyday
items and a bunch of Filipino goodies.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,749
Instant noodles in here, sinigang soup packet,

5
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:17,060
fruit from my mom's backyard, toothpaste

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,660
But then there's this

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,340
skin whitening products

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,000
Skin whiteners are a big business.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,980
More than four hundred million dollars worth of

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,480
skin whitening products is sold each
year in India alone

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,480
Eight out of ten women in Nigeria use skin lightening products,

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,540
the world's highest percentage

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,640
Skin lightening market in Asia-Pacific
alone is valued at over 13 billion US dollars

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,020
In 2015, the skin whitening industry

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,540
was worth about $10 billion worldwide

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,020
And by 2024 it is expected to

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,980
more than triple to $31.2 billion

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,560
These products have been around for a long time

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,740
and have proven to be damaging

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,700
physically and emotionally

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,520
So what accounts for the growing popularity?

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,600
For starters skin whitening products
rely on advertisements like these

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,220
"Wow, you have the most beautiful, glowing skin"

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,000
"Now, I have visibly fairer skin"

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
Skin color forms part of what gives us

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,960
access and prestige in society

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,560
All these negative
associations that society has already

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,600
imposed on dark skin

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,360
You can't be happy.
You can't find a man.

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,929
You don't fit into society beauty ideals

31
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:35,320
So the advertising is only reinforcing

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,220
and exacerbating a sustained message

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,060
Thanks to globalization, it's a message that's

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,220
reaching more people every year

35
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,220
The worldwide cosmetics market

36
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,500
was worth about $293.5 billion last year

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,140
and it is expected to grow

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,240
That growth is fueled by a rising middle class

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,400
especially in the Asia-Pacific region

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,880
which has the biggest share of the cosmetics market

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,480
But these products and the messages of
these ads are destructive because they

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,759
rely on a concept called "colorism"

43
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,910
which sociologist Margaret Hunter defines as

44
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,420
the process of discrimination that
privileges light-skinned people of color

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,420
over their dark-skinned counterparts.

46
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,640
One study showed that lighter skinned black women in North Carolina

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,800
received shorter prison sentences than their darker peers

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Another study found that white
interviewers deemed light-skinned blacks

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,920
and Hispanics more intelligent than
dark-skinned people

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,180
who had identical educational achievements.

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,060
They also reinforce centuries-old ideas about

52
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,460
race and hygiene.

53
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,940
Check out these old soap ads.

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,580
This was part of a larger project

55
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,560
of presenting white civilization,

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,460
European civilization

57
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,900
as superior

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,800
and here, the association is that

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,220
blackness is a form of

60
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,900
uncleanliness

61
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,100
that can be wiped away

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,520
But it's also, in many ways,

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,700
simply a very blatantly racist ad.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,860
During the civil rights era, the Black Power movement

65
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,060
sought to counter this idea with
messages like "Black is beautiful"

66
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,140
but that message

67
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,880
hasn't undone the damage
wrought by centuries of colorism

68
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,120
Cause this looks a lot like that one

69
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,040
Cause the way brown looks

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,820
These products are also

71
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,980
dangerous because they can physically
damage the skin

72
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,440
I've seen very intense cystic acne

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,160
I've seen irreversible skin thinning

74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,280
From using high-strength hydroquinone

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,620
I've seen ochronosis,

76
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,320
which is a paradoxical darkening of the skin.

77
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,980
Aside from creams and soaps,

78
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,680
there's a wide variety of ways

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,260
people are lightening their skin

80
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,000
like getting chemical peels

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,240
using glutathione injections or pills

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,240
or even applying cleaning bleach to their face and body

83
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,820
Hydroquinone is a highly toxic chemical
used in photo processing,

84
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,080
rubber manufacturing and hair dyes

85
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,220
but it is also one of the most commonly used ingredients for skin whitening

86
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,840
It's regulated in the U.S.

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,800
and banned in certain countries abroad

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,720
but consumers get their hands

89
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,200
on high concentrations of it

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,640
through under-the-table sources

91
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,400
In the U.S. light-skinned beauty standards still exists

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,160
in more subtle messages like

93
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,680
who is considered the most beautiful

94
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,420
and some celebrities of color

95
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,960
appearing to have lighter skin over time

96
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,491
You are looking to be white. What do you
say to that?

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,660
I would say that as an adult you decide to do things

98
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,220
It's like, do you guys condemn people who tan their skin?

99
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,878
Do they do it because they hate themselves?

100
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,640
No, it's a choice as an adult

101
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,560
While wanting lighter skin is
not a crime nor is it necessarily bad

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,660
it's important to be conscious of this
choice

103
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,760
and why it's different from skin tanning

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,340
or putting on lipstick

105
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,320
Because ultimately, from applying creams

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,980
and getting regular treatments

107
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,920
to avoiding skin tanning all together

108
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,580
skin whitening is a way of life

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Attitudes are starting to change

110
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,020
with inclusive makeup lines

111
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,500
and emojis,

112
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,380
media campaigns celebrating dark skin beauty

113
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,660
and more celebrities talking about the issue

114
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,300
"I still feel like that's what we're fighting,

115
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,860
healing from the past"

116
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,160
But many people are still unaware

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,760
of their preferences for light skin

118
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,860
because it's so deeply ingrained in
society

119
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,980
and despite the criticism and safety issues of these products

120
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,760
the projected growth in sales

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,020
means the world still has a long way to go

122
00:05:56,020 --> 00:00:00,000
until the practice of skin whitening becomes obsolete
