if you criticize Israel or the Jewish people are you a racist anti-semitic it's both the UK's Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn under huge pressure he's diffused around for now but the question remains what exactly does anti-semitism mean this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Hashim Alberta the definition of anti-semitism has long been a dividing topic it's commonly used to describe hostility to worse or discrimination against Jews as a religious or racial group but what's considered this criminal is disputed 31 countries have a daughter the definition by the international Holocaust Remembrance Alliance i h ra it includes eleven examples of anti-semitic behavior not everyone agrees on them and the issue has engulfed the UK's Labor Party in a row for months its leader Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of holding anti-semitic views on Tuesday he bowed under mounting pressure to adopt the full definition of IATA pay but with the caveat largely reports can you say what you want to about Israel without being accused of hating Jews these people who support Jeremy Corbyn believe it is entirely legitimate to condemn Israel as institutionally racist without being cast as racist themselves I mean this is a party that could become the party of government and we can't discuss matters of foreign policy the rights of the Palestinians to their own self-determination the the suffering that the Palestinians are experiencing at the hands of Israel we can't discuss that in the Labor Party because it would be defined as anti-semitic but these British Jews friends of Israel say that is bigotry fascism evil Jewish people at the moment everybody I know is considering leaving the country young people are leaving the country I know loads of young people in their twenties who've gone to Israel and you know if Jeremy Corbyn looks as if he's going to become big Prime Minister you will see a stream of Jewish people leaving the United Kingdom that has to be terrible at the heart of it was Labour's refusal to accept several examples of anti-semitic language and views as defined by the international Holocaust Remembrance alliance or IHRA it is deemed anti-semitic to say for instance that Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own country or that the State of Israel is by definition racists or that Israeli government policies are like those of Nazi Germany Corbin and his supporters had claimed this prevented them from properly criticizing Israel's actions towards the Palestinian people and the huge pressure to adopt the IHRA code the party executive finally did but also reserved the right to criticize Israel even the deputy party leader didn't seem convinced racist endeavor now will they be disciplined by the Labor Party look the the caveat is to what it says you could make your own minor critics will accuse the Labour Party of trying to play with words in this suppose compromise what is the difference between criticizing Israel and expressing support for the Palestinians and criticizing Israel's actions towards the Palestinians one might not be anti-semitic one might be is open to interpretation and certainly it is not the unequivocal backing of the anti-semitism code but many labour politicians have been demanding the danger in this for Corbyn is that in trying to keep his political party happy he will have upset his grassroots supporters who want to say what they like to about Israel this decision may not have cleared up anything Laura Lee al-jazeera London let's bring in our panel joining us in London we have Emma Fox the national organizer of the students vice program at Henry Jackson Society Sara Glyn join us from Dundee Scotland via Skype she is a member of the Scottish Jews against Zionism and from Tel Aviv giddy levy economist with Haaretz welcome to the program Emma how significant is the Labour Party's vote well I think that it is significant I think it's thoroughly disappointing that the iock are a definition of anti-semitism could it be adopted in full I think the criticisms of the definition are wildly unfounded I think that whilst this could be seen as a step in the right direction I think through the sort of caveats that Jeremy Corbyn wanted to put forward in addition to the definition has sort of undermined the entire process and again has sort of stuck it to the Jewish community and and told them that he actually doesn't care about them and their concerns Sarah would would this help the party move beyond the anti-semitism controversy that has been going on for quite some time any concession that is made to what's essentially bullying designed to get rid of a left and pro Palestinian leader would be seen as weakness and they going to push further I think it was interesting that your previous speaker talked about process because I don't think if anything to do with anti-semitism it's about the process and it is a process of McCarthyite willing if it wasn't anti-semitism it would be something else mm-hmm Gideon we seem to be having now some sort of mixed reactions towards the vote by Labour Party how do you see it I think that the Israeli propaganda and the Jewish community are mixing deliberately between genuine criticism about Israel about Zionism about the occupation and anti-semitism and they're doing so it's not new is the old weapon of Israel to paralyze any kind of criticism about Israel or the occupational Zionism I think that this will continue because it is very efficient because it did paralyze many Israeli critics in the world labeling them as anti-semites with no reason Emma you said that it's fine with adopting the ihr A's definition but no to the caveats particularly the one which talks about freedom of expression when it comes to Israel and the support for the rights of the policy is why should you be concerned with plainly says that this should not prompt us from saying things for what they are I think essentially by caveat iing the ihr a definition with this little phrase about freedom of speech inherently just says that the definition does prohibit freedom of speech and criticism of the Israeli government and Israeli policy and that is not what the definition does and the idea that protection of Jewish the Jewish community is in any way to do with the occupation or to do with people having the right to speak out and protest and campaign against the Israeli government is is absurd and I think that it's really undermining to put this unnecessary caveat at the end of a definition of racism and I think it shows complete disregard for the concerns of the Jewish community mm-hmm Sarah how do you respond to the growing criticism that we've seen over the last few hours by the Jewish community in the UK about the caveat saying that they were they basically undermining the very basic tenets of the Jewish community the Jewish community there are many Jewish communities there are many different views from within Judaism and that is actually the essence of it because there are the suggestion in those examples that go with the definition does do conflate Zionism with Judaism and not all Jews support Zionism of course not all Zionists the jews either and it was very interesting the examples that your people speak and choose were examples about criticizing the israeli government it wasn't it doesn't allow for criticism of the idea of Zionism another sign his speech and of a speech that specifically puts one ethnic or religious group in front of others mr. levy Corbin's political career has never been an easy one now after this vote this is something which we positions him as the uncontested leader of the left in the UK absolutely and rightly so and therefore I think people of conscience leftist and people of conscious people who care about human rights people who care about justice especially in the Middle East should cross their fingers and hope that he will be one day very soon hopefully the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom because he really presents something else and he really presents a real hope when hope is so rare in this part of the world I think that someone who will talk in a different language an entire different language in the language of being conscious in a language of justice of equality this language we are missing here in the Middle East so much and if this will happen I think it's almost miraculous and I'm really really hoping that this will happen em'ly many supporters of the Labour Party and during a comment in particular say the reason why you and many other people criticize him criticized his legacy and the whole anti-semitism thing is because the man has been staunchly defending the rights of the Palestinians staunchly criticizing Israel's politics yeah I would just like to say that I've really disputed the fact that the Jewish community expressing concern over hatred towards them somehow disregards their their concern and compassion towards the Palestinians towards any other type of group or conflict this definition is entirely about racism towards the Jewish community and is not about lack of compassion towards a conflict or any other type of or any type other type of issue that goes on and again I think the idea that the the Corbyn because he covers a lot of the anti-semitic stances and associates that he's had in the past as pro palestinian activism is appalling and i think we really need to distinguish this fact that the reason why the jewish community are very concerned with Corbin's actions is not towards the fact that he's shown support for the palestinians and their struggle which is many jews feel to but it's his associates it's the hosting of of anti-semites it's his support for terrorist groups with genocide all intent towards the Jewish community it is it is these things that are really really concerning and not any type of support for the Palestinians which I think we can all agree is a legitimate cause Sarah would you like to step in here yeah absolutely I mean you've got probably the most anti-racist man in politics who in Jeremy Corbyn and it's it's just absurd to think to describe him as anti-semitic or anything that he does as anti-semitic this leader will a few people who are anti-semitic or say anti-semitic things accent you know with misunderstanding is the Labour Party but far fewer than in other parties I mean it's much anti-semitism is much less prominent on the left the anti-semitism we should be really seriously concerned about is the anti-semitism on the far right and the best way of undercutting that anti-semitism is a strong left movement mr. levy those who say that the lines here are blurred and that the far white and the blare rights in the Labor Party are the ones who are pushing for this smear campaign to dislodge cobain because they know that the man if he stays in power he's likely going to be the next leader yeah absolutely I think that a real danger for Jews for injustice is much more in the far right wing all over the world by the way Israel is now the best friend of the Hungarian prime minister he is much more of an anti-semite than anyone in the British labor anyone and still Israel is saluting to to Hungary and to it said Prime Minister I think that there is he really a very cynical manipulation people don't like Hoban because he is too much of a leftist the Jewish community part of the Jewish community the Jewish establishment it is fighting cobain because he's too pro palestinian and too anti-occupation maybe anti Israeli and by the end of the day it is so much not only legitimate and it is so much needed to criticize Israel to support the Palestinians and to speak as I said before in a new language which is unknown in the West therefore we are all looking forward to see him as Prime Minister anti-semitism is a controversial subject sparking reactions worldwide party leader Mahmoud Abbas apologized for remarks he made about the Holocaust he previously said the historic past a huge of European Jews was caused by their conduct not their religion South Carolina became the first US state to pass legislation to fight anti-semitism in colleges and universities defining it as cause for attacks on Jews blaming Israel for all political tensions and denying its right to exist some 300 French public figures signed a manifesto denouncing a new anti-semitism the warned against what they called Islamist radicalization and demanded certain passages of the Koran be removed Germans of various faiths were war Jewish skullcaps and took to the streets in several cities to protest against an anti-semitic attack in Berlin the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan lost his verify Twitter status after he posted a video warning about what he called The Satanic Jew Emma we've seen the reactions coming from different political leaders in the UK and different representatives of the Jewish community or communities sarah has been saying previously now after the vote do you think that a chapter has been turned and that the labor could finally now build or rebuild trust with the Jewish communities well I think the mice Margaret Hodge has mentioned it it's almost like one step forward and two steps back I think that it was absolutely right that the ihr a definition which has been adopted in 31 countries by countless organizations should be adopting a full but I think it's wrong that Corbyn felt the needs to put an unnecessary caveat about free speech on Israel which is not which is inherent within the definition the definition of anti-semitism does not prohibit any type of criticism of Israel and the Israeli government so I do think that it's almost like Corbin hers and has sort of given the Jewish community a kick in the teeth and said okay I'll bow to pressure and I'm we will adopt the full definition of anti-semitism that most people agree is the right one but on the other hand I'm also going to put in a clause that almost gives the green light to racists and anti-semites mm-hmm Sarah but here's the problem here basically many are saying that the International definition of anti-semitism should not be used as a pretext to muzzle discontent all over the world particularly when it comes to targeting the policies of Israel so you can't come back to people and say wait you have to stop there because you've crossed the red line specifically silences criticism of Zionism per se you know it it does allow you to criticize certain policies but it doesn't allow you to say hang on a minute I think actually the whole nature underlying nature of the state is why the problems stem from that's really important okay yesterday let me go to Gideon Levy mr. levy one of the concerns that were voiced by the Jewish community in the UK is basically or all over the world is Zionism conflated with Jews but as you know these are not set into stone many people say that we have to face the reality which is basically Zionism is creating problems for Israel because of its policies look first of all the Jewish communities or at least there is publish men's for sure in the UK but also in other places in Europe and for sure in the United States identify themselves almost automatically and blindly with any kind of policy that Israel is taken not only with zone ism but with any kind of policy including obviously maintaining this brutal reality of military occupation over 50 years this has a price because once the Jewish establishments are identifying themselves blindly automatically with any kind of Israeli government and any kind of Israeli policy they are also exposing themselves for certain dangers obviously this can be translated into anti-semitism in many cases which I'm totally against don't be wrong anti-semitism should be fought but it must also be understood that many times the policy of Israel lures anti-semitism all over the world mm-hmm Anna you've made the far left and Corbin in particular some sort of a rival and enemy but aren't you concerned that we all know this is the time of the age of the populist movements and the far-right but tomorrow the left can stage a comeback aren't you concerned by staging these political statements you might be burning bridges with the left all over the world no I don't think so at all I think the suggestion that Jewish community coming out against concerns over their threats threats to them and racism is it's absolutely legitimate and I don't think that that is a fair suggestion I think also I think previously was mentioned that concerns over far rights anti-semitism overshadows and means that we can't talk about anti-semitism on the left and that is absolutely not the case and I think the revivalism of Corbin and the fact that Corbin has so much power as being the leader of the Opposition of her I'll just ease government I think means that we that this is a real serious concern and that we can do two things at once we can be concerned about populism and anti-semitism on the right but at this very moment in time korban and anti-semitism on the left is very very powerful and they are gaining more and more mainstream legitimacy and that's something that I think is justified to be concerned about after the controversy Sarah do you think that the Labour Party is going to come out more sensitive about those concerns or on the contrary more aggressive about those issues particularly criticizing Israel and support for the rights of the Palestinians split and this is all I can I mean it's we've got a coloured own a coalition of course between the people who are arguing these things the zionist reasons and people arguing it because they want to return the Labor Party to the blaring party that it was so this is a fight for the soul of the Labor Party and the Labour Party is tearing itself apart in the time when we need a strong left movement so I am very worried about it and obviously I'm also concerned that Jews should be in this in this fight for the soul of the Labor Party we've got these very right-wing Jewish leaders who are trying to tell the Labour Party what to say why should the Labour Party say we just want to say Sarah Glen levy Emma Fox thank you very much indeed for your contribution to the program and thank you too for watching you can see the programme again any
