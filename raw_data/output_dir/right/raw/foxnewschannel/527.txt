00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:04,504
EVERY CASE.

00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,716
BY FAR.

8
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,451
WE CALL HIM THE GREAT ONE, MARK

9
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,987
LIVE IN.

10
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:22,322
LET ME THROW IT RIGHT TO YOU.

11
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,390
I'VE BEEN DOING RADIO 30 YEARS,

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,925
I'VE BEEN AT THE

13
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,293
FOX NEWS CHANNEL SINCE

14
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,562
OCTOBER 1996, IT'S NEVER BEEN

15
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,330
THIS AWFUL AND IT'S BEEN BAD A

16
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:48,781
LOT OF TIMES.

17
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:49,482
>> A COUPLE THINGS HERE, FIRST

18
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,183
OF ALL NOTICE THERE IS NO BLUE

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:50,583
DRESS HERE.

20
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,251
OUT OF THESE THREE ACCUSERS,

21
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:51,851
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE EYE

22
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:52,185
WITNESS.

23
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:52,719
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,386
CORROBORATING WITNESS, NOT A

25
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,053
SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE SO

26
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:54,787
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON.

27
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:55,121
NO CASE.

28
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:55,488
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY DOES

29
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,391
DEMOCRATIC THEY BELIEVE THAT

30
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,526
ONLY THE SENATE JUDICIARY

31
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,529
COMMITTEE.

32
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,331
NO DUE PROCESS AND NO

33
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,799
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BECAUSE

34
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,738
I HAVE TO MAKE THAT CASE.

35
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,608
THE DEMOCRATS, THE LAWYERS AND

36
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:19,713
OPERATIVES, THE SENATOR IS ALL

37
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,414
SCHEMING IN THE SHADOWS, THEY

38
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:24,518
COME UP WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE OR

39
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:24,885
CONCRETE.

40
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,087
THE REASON THEY BLOW THIS OFF AS

41
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,756
A COURT OF LAW IS BECAUSE THAT'S

42
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,924
HOW TOTALITARIANS THINK.

43
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,526
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT MAKE

44
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,127
ACCUSATIONS, AND THIS ISN'T

45
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,128
ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS.

46
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:35,996
THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

47
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,831
OF WOMEN OUT THERE MANY OF THEM

48
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,499
WATCHING YOUR SHOW.

49
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,369
MY WIFE, MY MOTHER, MY DAUGHTER,

50
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,537
MY STEPDAUGHTER, MY

51
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,871
MOTHER-IN-LAW AND SO FORTH WHO

52
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,907
DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS.

53
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,442
THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

54
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,111
WOMEN WHO FIND THIS ENTIRE

55
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,945
SPECTACLE, IT'S A

56
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,313
ROMAN COLOSSEUM AND THEY ARE

57
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:57,084
THROWING THEM TO THE LINES.

58
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:57,951
LIBERALS DON'T SPEAK TO WOMEN.

59
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,321
DID BILL CLINTON SPEAK FOR ALL

60
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,489
THE WOMEN HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED?

61
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,926
I DON'T THINK SO.

62
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,228
PEOPLE KEEP SAYING BRETT

63
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,130
KAVANAUGH HAD SIX FBI BACKGROUND

64
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,597
INVESTIGATIONS.

65
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,732
HOW MANY BACKGROUND

66
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,400
INVESTIGATIONS DID MS. FORD

67
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,700
HAVE?

68
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,735
ZERO.

69
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,336
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ACCUSERS?

70
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,938
HOW MANY BACKGROUND

71
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,706
INVESTIGATIONS DID THEY HAVE?

72
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,006
ZERO.

73
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,809
IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO ME THAT

74
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,510
ALL THINGS LEFT-WING DEMOCRAT

75
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,745
LAWYERS WHO REPRESENT THESE

76
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:29,516
ACCUSERS, THEY KNOW WHERE THE

77
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,117
MONTGOMERY COUNTY POLICE

78
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:30,851
DEPARTMENT IS AND THEY HAVEN'T

79
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,386
WALKED A SINGLE ONE OF THEIR

80
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,221
CLIENTS INTO THAT

81
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,492
COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHK

82
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:38,525
COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHV

83
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:38,558

00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:38,592
COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHU

85
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:33,520
COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHH

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICE TO FILE A

87
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,493
COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGH.

88
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,462
THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE FBI.

89
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,898
IF YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS, DON'T

90
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,533
YOU GO AHEAD AND FILE YOUR

91
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,034
COMPLAINTS THERE?

92
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,703
AND I WILL TELL YOU YOU WHY

93
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,538
BECAUSE THEN THE RULE OF LAW

94
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,775
ACTUALLY KICKS IN.

95
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:55,509
I'M STARTING TO WONDER ABOUT THE

96
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,176
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

97
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,714
THEY ARE EITHER FILLED WITH

98
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,448
PERVERTS OR TOTALITARIANS, IT'S

99
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,282
ONE OR THE OTHER.

100
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,952
THEY ARE GLEEFUL ANTS EXCITING

101
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:08,389
AND SALIVATING ALL OVER THIS.

102
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,924
IT'S A DISGUSTING SPECTACLE.

103
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,526
AND, ANOTHER THING I WANT TO

104
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,263
MENTION WHICH IS THIS, THIS LADY

105
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:21,869
COMES FORWARD AND POLITICO

106
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,904
REPORTS HE DOESN'T BELIEVE A

107
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,538
WORD SHE SAYS.

108
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,973
MICHAEL AVENATTI IS BACK, THE

109
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,207
SLIP AND FALL LAWYER.

110
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,510
THE DEMOCRATS EMBRACE HIM AND

111
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,544
EMBRACE THE ARGUMENT.

112
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,746
MS. RAMIREZ DID NOT WANT TO COME

113
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,347
FORWARD.

114
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,349
THE DEMOCRATS STAFF GOES AND

115
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:43,791
FINDS HER AND DRAGS HER FORWARD,

116
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,794
AND AND I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD

117
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:47,962
THIS DR. FORD ISSUE.

118
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,229
SHE WANTED TO REMAIN PRIVATE SO

119
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,498
WHERE DID SHE GO TO

120
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,066
"THE WASHINGTON POST"?

121
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,300
NOW HERE'S THE THING.

122
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,436
I KEEP HEARING ALL OVER

123
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,304
TELEVISION, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT

124
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,739
DR. FORD HAS TO SAY.

125
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,775
OF COURSE, WE ALL WANT TO HEAR

126
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:07,081
WHAT DR. FORD HAS TO SAY.

127
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,084
SHE HAS A PhD AND AN

128
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,085
ALLEGATION AGAINST ANOTHER HUMAN

129
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,754
BEING.

137
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:16,089

EXAMINATION                    D

139
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:25,666
AGGRESSIVELY.

140
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,736
AND THE FOUR PEOPLE SHE MENTIONS

141
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,971
SAY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

142
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:32,473
MS. FORD NEEDS TO BE QUESTIONED

143
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:32,940
AND THOROUGHLY.

144
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,809
AND I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

145
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,912
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, THIS

146
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:39,513

151
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:48,222

00:04:58,532 --> 00:04:59,934
TO APPEAL THE MOST RADICAL

157
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:01,435
CRAZIES IN THEIR PARTY.

158
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:05,339
