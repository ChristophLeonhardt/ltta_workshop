NOT TOO LONG AGO IN WEST VIRGINIA THE TEACHERS DECIDED THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE AND THEY STRUCK, AND IT TOOK A WHILE BUT FINALLY THEY DID GET A PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR THEIR EFFORT IN TERMS OF PAY, BENEFITS, AND ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST CONCERNS ACTUALLY WAS HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. NOW THE MEDIA I THINK THAT A POOR JOB AT TALKING AND COVERING THAT TOPIC. BUT DESPITE THAT, THANKFULLY TEACHERS UNIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY PAID ATTENTION AND IN THE WAKE OF THE WEST VIRGINIA STRIKES OTHER STATES HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE SOME SORT OF COLLECTIVE ACTION WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR EDUCATION SYSTEM. OKLAHOMA IS ONE OF THE LATEST, AND IT WAS ANNOUNCED A DAY OR TWO AGO THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO A WALK OUT ON MONDAY. THEY HADN'T AS FAR AS I KNOW ANNOUNCED ANY SORT OF ONGOING STRIKE, BUT THEY WERE GOING TO DO A DEMONSTRATION, AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS I BELIEVE THEY WERE AT PRESENT THE 47TH LOWEST AVERAGE PAID TEACHERS IN THE COUNTRY. WHICH IS PRETTY INSANE. AND THEY HADN'T GOTTEN A RAISE IN SOME THING LIKE 10 YEARS. SO THEY ANNOUNCED A WALKOUT. OKLAHOMA LAWMAKERS DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING TO TRY TO WARD OFF THAT WALKOUT THAT MIGHT NOT SOUND HUGE BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT OKLAHOMA TEACHERS AREN'T MAKING $200,000 A YEAR, SO THAT'S SOMETHING CERTAINLY, BUT IT WON'T BE ENOUGH TO STOP THE WALKOUT. THE PRESIDENT FOR THE OKLAHOMA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION HAD THIS TO SAY AFTER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE RAISE WOULD BE FUNDED I'M GLAD THAT THE UNION THERE ISN'T JUST FOCUSED ON THEIR OWN WAGES OF TEACHERS, BUT ALSO OF SUPPORT STAFF IN THE SCHOOLS AND FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOL WHICH IS TRENDING DOWN NOT JUST IN OKLAHOMA BUT IN A NUMBER OF STATES OVER THE LAST DECADE PLUS. THIS IS A STATE WHERE TEACHERS WOULD HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE ONE DAY A WEEK WORKING AT WALMART TO MAKE ENDS MEET, AND ALSO JUST THE PAY, AND FILLING QUOTAS, THERE WERE SO MANY TEACHER SPOTS LEFT EMPTY THAT THEY WERE FILLING QUOTAS WITH SECRETARY SPOTS AND UNQUALIFIED PEOPLE TO BE TEACHING KIDS. BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY IS THE PREEMPTIVE MEASURES ON BEHALF OF LEGISLATORS BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF STRIKING AND THE FEAR OF UNIONS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A 100 YEAR WAR ON WORKERS AND UNIONS WE HAVE SEEN TAKE PLACE WITH THE RICH AND POWERFUL AND IT HAS WORKED, WE HAVE ERASED IT FROM OUR CONSCIOUSNESS, WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL MONUMENTAL MOVEMENTS THAT UNIONS AND WORKERS HAVE HAD, THE EIGHT HOUR WORKDAY, THE WEEKEND, ALL LABOR PROTECTIONS. THIS IS A HUGE MEASURE, IT'S ALSO JUST SHOWING HOW SCARED LEGISLATORS ARE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE POWER OF WORKERS AND THE POWER OF PEOPLE WALKING OUT, BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHO REALLY PUTS THE WEALTH INTO SOCIETY AND WHO MAKES SOCIETY FUNCTION, BECAUSE THE RICH AND POWERFUL WILL CEASED TO BE ABLE TO WORK ANYTHING WITHOUT THE WORKERS AT THEIR BEHEST. THEY PUT THEM TO THE TEST IN WEST VIRGINIA, THERE WERE LITERALLY NO SCHOOLS IN ANY COUNTY THAT WERE OPEN, SO IMAGINE BEING A PARENT AND HAVING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR KIDS THAT DAY? AND THEY KEPT THE STRIKE GOING UNTIL THEY WON, SO TEACHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE SAYING WE HAVE TO GO ON STRIKE TOO AND PUT THEM TO THE TEST. AND IN OKLAHOMA THEY WILL GET TO THE WALKOUT, THEY HAVEN'T YET. THEY JUST THREATENED, AND THEY GOT A GIANT INCREASE IN THEIR PAY, AND THEY GOT WHAT THEY DESERVED. IS NOT A QUESTION OF GETTING MORE JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT MORE, IT'S LIKE PEOPLE NEED TO GET PAID WHAT THEY ARE WORTH, AND RIGHT NOW TEACHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN MOST PLACES AREN'T GETTING PAID WHAT THEY ARE WORTH BECAUSE WE HAD THIS RADICAL RIGHT WING SOCIAL EXPERIMENT CALLED TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS WHERE WE GIVE ALL THE MONEY TO THE RICH PEOPLE AND IT SOMEHOW SPREADS TO THE REST OF US MAGICALLY WITH THE MAGICAL TRICKLE-DOWN FAIRY. IT DOESN'T WORK, AND WE ARE NOW REACHING THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THAT SOCIAL EXPERIMENT AND REALIZING IT'S COMPLETELY FALSE AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO THINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CUT PUBLIC SERVICES DOWN TO THE BONE. I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS CUTTING OR MAKING OTHER WORKERS PAY FOR THE TEACHERS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? TAXING CIGARETTES, OIL, THIS IS OTHER AVERAGE WORKERS WHO ARE PAYING MORE FOR GAS, SECRETS, ALCOHOL, AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE ANSWER, I THINK THE ANSWER IS TAXING THE RICH. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. CAN WE PUT THIS IN CONTEXT? THIS IS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST STORIES I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME, ONE OF THE REDDEST STATES IN THE COUNTRY, THE STATE THAT PRODUCED SCOTT PRUITT IS EVERY STORY ABOUT OKLAHOMA HERE? IN OKA HOME A SPECIAL AT TYT. IT'S ALL ONE DAY, GOOD FRIDAY, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OKLAHOMA. HERE IS A RED, RED STATE THAT AGREED TO RAISE TAXES. NO MATTER WHERE THE TAXES ARE COMING FROM. AND ON OIL AND GAS. THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY, AND A REALLY GREAT, HOPEFUL THING FOR THE FUTURE. AND IN THEIR CONSTITUTION YOU HAVE TO GET THREE FOURTHS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO AGREE IN ORDER TO RAISE ANY TAX. SO THEY HAD TO GET THREE FOURTHS OF A REPUBLICAN DOMINATED LEGISLATURE IN BOTH CHAMBERS TO AGREE TO THIS TAX, AND THAT TO ME IS ALSO REALLY HOPEFUL BECAUSE YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE THIS POPULIST BRUSHFIRE REVOLT NOT IN PLACES LIKE, YOU KNOW, NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON AND VERMONT, IT'S, LIKE, HAPPENING IN OKLAHOMA AND WEST VIRGINIA AND PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF IT AND THEY WON'T PUT UP WITH IT ANYMORE, AND THEY WILL FORCE EVEN A DOMINATED REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE, I IMAGINE IT'S 75% REPUBLICAN, VOTING TO THE TUNE OF 75% INCREASE TAXES BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THIS SOCIAL EXPERIMENT OF TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS DOESN'T WORK, IT'S BROKEN. AND IT DIDN'T EVEN REQUIRE A TWEET FROM DAVID HOGG. I LOVE THAT 75% THRESHOLD, OKLAHOMA IS OBVIOUSLY NOT THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS THAT, AND THE STATES THAT HAVE AN EXTRA THRESHOLD FOR CERTAIN LAWS, WHY IS IT ALWAYS FOR TAXES? LIKE WHAT STATE DO YOU NEED 80% OF THE VOTE TO TAKE AWAY ABORTION RIGHTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? IT'S ONLY RAISING TAXES. AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IF YOU GET ENOUGH OF A MAJORITY YOU CRIPPLE SOCIAL AND LEGISLATIVE PROGRESS POSSIBLY FOR DECADES ON ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES, IT'S ONE OF THOSE TRICKLE-DOWN POLICIES. BUT I FIND THIS TO BE POSITIVE TOO, YOU MENTIONED DAVID HOGG, I LOVE THAT THE UNIONS ARE GETTING MORE ACTIVE, I THINK THERE ARE FEW INDIVIDUAL THINGS THAT COULD BE BETTER FOR AMERICA RIGHT NOW THEN AN ENTIRELY INVIGORATED, ACTIVE, PASSIONATE UNION PUSH ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES. BUT EVEN OUTSIDE OF UNIONS IN THE PAST YEAR OR TWO WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF HUGE MARCHES, EVEN RECENTLY THE MARCH FOR OUR LIVES, AND THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING OUT THERE, THEY ARE GETTING OUT IN THE STREETS AND GETTING OUT TO RUN IN PRIMARIES, AND I KNOW SOME INDIVIDUALS MIGHT LOOK AT A PARTICULAR MARCH AND SAY THAT SEEMS LIKE A WASTE OF TIME, I'M NOT OF THAT OPINION, I THINK THAT AMERICANS HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY APATHETIC FOR FAR TOO LONG, SO ALMOST ANYTHING THEY CAN GET MOTIVATED FOR I'M A FAN OF. BUT WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE MARCHING FOR LITERALLY THE CONCEPT OF SCIENCE, OR FOR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS, THAT I THINK IS A VERY POSITIVE THING. AND I'M ALL FOR UNIONS BEING AS BIG A PART OF THAT AS POSSIBLE. AND THESE PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF THE CONTAGION OF STRIKE STOP AND WE SAW THE WEST VIRGINIA TEACHERS STRIKE WORKED, THIS IS GOING TO WORK, UNIONS AND STRIKES WORK AND THEY PUT THE FEAR OF GOD INTO LEGISLATORS AND BUSINESS OWNERS. AND I HATE THAT WORKERS ARE DEMONIZED, WORKERS WHO WALKOUT, THEY SAY THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE KIDS THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE KIDS, OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNDERFUNDED, THERE IS NO INCENTIVE FOR THE RICH AND POWERFUL TO PUT FUNDING IN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED THE MASSES EDUCATED, IT'S MOSTLY SERVICE SECTOR JOBS, THEY JUST WANT THE 1% THAT THEY CAN PUT IN THEIR PRIVATE EDUCATION. SO WE NEED TO EMBOLDEN WORKERS AND SUPPORT THEM FOR WALKING OUT AND ENCOURAGE THAT THIS IS THE ANSWER TO HOLD THE RICH AND POWERFUL ACCOUNTABLE. BUT CONSERVATIVES ARE HAPPY TO GIVE THEM GUNS. PENCILS, NO. PENCILS, CROWNS, PAPER, I JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. BUT IF YOU NEED GUNS WE'VE GOT THEM COVERED. THAT'S THE CRAZY TWILIGHT ZONE POLITICS WE ARE LIVING IN IN AMERICA TODAY. I WAS IN DC FOR THE MARCH ON SATURDAY AND IT WAS EXHILARATING, AND IT DON'T THINK THAT THE ENERGY THAT WAS CREATED BY THOSE 800,000 IN DC AND THOSE MILLIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD WAS LIMITED TO GUNS, I THINK IT WAS LIGHTING THE MATCH THAT IS GOING TO SPREAD ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND I THINK WE ARE MOVING INTO A POSITIVE TIME AS WE HEAD INTO THE MIDTERMS WHICH IS WHERE THE REAL TSUNAMI CAN HAPPEN.
