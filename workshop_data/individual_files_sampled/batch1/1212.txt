on Iranian state TV pictures of government supporters filling city streets condemning protests and deaths during days of unrest it's basically people who are believing that what's what's happening is against the regime and they want to support the regime by saying this is a revolutionary regime and we are in favor of it the TV pictures of Wednesday's pro-government rallies are a contrast to coverage of demonstrations against Iran's leadership which began last Thursday the government has shut down some social media platforms but pictures have been posted showing damaged cars burning buildings and chanting crowds protests about unemployment and Iran's economy which has been struggling after years of sanctions have grown to include demands for greater freedoms hundreds of people have been arrested the u.s. is demanding an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council if the Iranian dictatorships history is any guide we can expect more outrageous abuses in the days to come the UN must speak out president Donald Trump has sided with the anti-government protesters he's tweeted the people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime all of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their pockets the people have little food big inflation and no human rights the US is watching iran's Foreign Minister has tweeted back saying Iran's security and stability depend on its own people who unlike the peoples of trumps original BFFs or best friends forever have the right to vote and to protest more pro-government rallies are expected but that have also been calls for more demonstrations against the government it's not clear if both sides will be on the same streets at the same time Rob Madison al-jazeera
