00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,014
OFFENSE IS AND KIND OF SKATING ON IT FOR NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT

101
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,383
ON IT FOR NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE THAT EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT

102
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:12,984
MAYBE THAT EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT HIM THAT PERHAPS JUST ADMITTING

103
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:14,085
HIM THAT PERHAPS JUST ADMITTING IT IS HIS BEST DEFENSE?

104

IT IS HIS BEST DEFENSE? >> I THINK THE EXPERIENCE HAS

105
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:16,988

106
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,423
TAUGHT HIM THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOES NOT HAVE THE WILL OR

107
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:19,858
PARTY DOES NOT HAVE THE WILL OR STRENGTH TO CALL HIM ON IT,

108
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:20,191
STRENGTH TO CALL HIM ON IT, RIGHT?

109
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,930
RIGHT? WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, IMPEACHMENT

110
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:26,298
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, IMPEACHMENT FUNDAMENTALLY IS A POLITICAL

111
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:26,631
FUNDAMENTALLY IS A POLITICAL CRIME.

112
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,700
CRIME. AT SOME POINT, AT SOME POINT

113
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,435
AT SOME POINT, AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO PUT A

114
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,670
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO PUT A MICROPHONE IN FRONT OF PAUL

115
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,405
MICROPHONE IN FRONT OF PAUL RYAN’S FACE AND ASK HIM IF HE IS

116
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:36,208
RYAN’S FACE AND ASK HIM IF HE IS AN ALLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

117
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:37,042
AN ALLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR IF HE’S AN ALLY TO DONALD

118
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,443
OR IF HE’S AN ALLY TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE INCREASINGLY THOSE

119
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,779
TRUMP BECAUSE INCREASINGLY THOSE TWO THINGS ARE INCOMPATIBLE.

120
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:42,514
TWO THINGS ARE INCOMPATIBLE. I THINK TRUMP ONCE AGAIN IS JUST

121
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:45,050
I THINK TRUMP ONCE AGAIN IS JUST BANKING ON THE INHERENT WEAKNESS

122
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,151
BANKING ON THE INHERENT WEAKNESS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO

123
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,285
OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO ACTUALLY STOP HIM FROM DOING ANY

124
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,153
ACTUALLY STOP HIM FROM DOING ANY OF THIS.

125
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:50,022

00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:55,569
WASN’T ANYTHING WRONG ABOUT THIS MEETING WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO

284
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,770
MEETING WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO INSIST HE DOESN’T KNOW ABOUT IT,

285
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,472
INSIST HE DOESN’T KNOW ABOUT IT, A FACT THAT MAY FALL APART

286
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:01,775
A FACT THAT MAY FALL APART BECAUSE WE’VE SEEN MICHAEL COHEN

287
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:03,077
BECAUSE WE’VE SEEN MICHAEL COHEN TELLING REPORTERS THAT IN FACT

288
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,812
TELLING REPORTERS THAT IN FACT THE PRESIDENT DID KNOW ABOUT IT.

289
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:06,213
THE PRESIDENT DID KNOW ABOUT IT. >> IF HE DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT IT,

290
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:08,015
>> IF HE DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT IT, THAT SAYS HE’S SHOVING DON JR.

291
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,817
THAT SAYS HE’S SHOVING DON JR. OUT IN FRONT OF HIM SAYING,

292
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,885
OUT IN FRONT OF HIM SAYING, WELL, HE KNEW ABOUT IT.

293
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:12,286
WELL, HE KNEW ABOUT IT. >> THAT WOULD BE THE CASE.

294
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:14,188
>> THAT WOULD BE THE CASE. I THINK IF YOU WERE MAKING A

295
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:15,189
I THINK IF YOU WERE MAKING A CONVENTIONAL LEGAL ARGUMENT, BUT

296
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,691
CONVENTIONAL LEGAL ARGUMENT, BUT IT REALLY FEELS AT THIS POINT

297
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:19,026
IT REALLY FEELS AT THIS POINT THAT WE’VE MOVED BEYOND ANY SORT

298
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,395
THAT WE’VE MOVED BEYOND ANY SORT OF A LEGAL ARGUMENT AND WE ARE

299
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,231
OF A LEGAL ARGUMENT AND WE ARE SORT OF PREPARING AND INOKAY CUE

300
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,832
SORT OF PREPARING AND INOKAY CUE LATING FOR WHAT’S COMING NEXT.

301
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,834
LATING FOR WHAT’S COMING NEXT. HE SAID, OKAY, I SHOT SOMEBODY

302
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:28,402
HE SAID, OKAY, I SHOT SOMEBODY ON FIFTH AVENUE BUT I MISSED SO

303
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:29,036
ON FIFTH AVENUE BUT I MISSED SO IT’S OKAY.

304
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,604
IT’S OKAY. WELL, NO, THAT WOULD BE A CRIME,

305
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:30,905
WELL, NO, THAT WOULD BE A CRIME, TOO.

306
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:33,241
TOO. BUT I THINK THE IDEA IS THEY

307
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,809
BUT I THINK THE IDEA IS THEY KEEP GIVING OUT A LITTLE MORE.

308
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,243
KEEP GIVING OUT A LITTLE MORE. A FEW MONTHS FROM NOW HE’S GOING

309
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:39,380
A FEW MONTHS FROM NOW HE’S GOING TO SAY, YES, I HAD A PHONE CALL

310
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,749
TO SAY, YES, I HAD A PHONE CALL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN TO THROW THE

311
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,251
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN TO THROW THE ELECTION IN WISCONSIN BUT WE

312
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,752
ELECTION IN WISCONSIN BUT WE DIDN’T TALK ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA.

313
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:47,154
DIDN’T TALK ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA. >> IT IS INCREDIBLE BUT ELIE

314
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,691
>> IT IS INCREDIBLE BUT ELIE MADE THE POINT THAT ALL OF THIS

315
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:50,558
MADE THE POINT THAT ALL OF THIS IS GEARING UP TOWARDS ONE

316
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:50,892
IS GEARING UP TOWARDS ONE OUTCOME.

317
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:52,760
OUTCOME. THERE IS A FINDING YOU CAN’T

318
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:54,328
THERE IS A FINDING YOU CAN’T PROSECUTE THE SITTING PRESIDENT

319
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,964
PROSECUTE THE SITTING PRESIDENT F. THAT FINDING HOLDS, THIS IS

320
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:57,432

ABOUT IMPEACHMENT. EVEN WITH A BLATANT ADMISSION

322
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,472
EVEN WITH A BLATANT ADMISSION THAT, YES, THIS WAS ABOUT

00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:40,509
SO THEY WILL, I THINK AT A POINT IN WHICH THE PROSECUTOR DUMPS

IN WHICH THE PROSECUTOR DUMPS THIS REPORT, THEY’LL SAY, THIS

THIS REPORT, THEY’LL SAY, THIS IS MUCH TO DO ABOUT NOTHING.

00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:45,380
IS MUCH TO DO ABOUT NOTHING. THIS IS ALL POLITICAL.

GOVERNMENT TO USE IN AN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN?

713
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:57,498
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN? IS THERE ANY WAY THAT THAT IS

714
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,332

00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:42,543
CONNECTED TO THE KREMLIN. IS THERE ANY WAY TO LEGALLY USE

AND NOT DISCLOSE IT? >> NO, BUT NOT EVEN NECESSARILY

744
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,352
>> NO, BUT NOT EVEN NECESSARILY BECAUSE IT’S STOLEN, MORE

745
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:53,454
BECAUSE IT’S STOLEN, MORE BECAUSE IT’S ANYTHING OF VALUE

746
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,756
BECAUSE IT’S ANYTHING OF VALUE AND THE STATUTE PROHIBITS

747
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,291
AND THE STATUTE PROHIBITS RECEIVING OR TRYING TO RECEIVE

OR OBTAIN ANYTHING OF VALUE FROM A FOREIGN POWER.

750
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:03,398
A FOREIGN POWER. WE NEED NOT REACH WHETHER OR NOT

751
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:05,400
WE NEED NOT REACH WHETHER OR NOT THE MATERIAL WAS STOLEN BECAUSE

752
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,502
THE MATERIAL WAS STOLEN BECAUSE AS LONG AS IT IS SOMETHING OF

753
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:08,670
AS LONG AS IT IS SOMETHING OF VALUE, IT DOESN’T NEED TO BE A

754
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,972
VALUE, IT DOESN’T NEED TO BE A BAG OF CASH OR A BAR OF GOLD.

755
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:13,174
BAG OF CASH OR A BAR OF GOLD. ANYTHING OF VALUE CAN BE

756
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,909
ANYTHING OF VALUE CAN BE PAMPHLETS, IT CAN BE -- IT CAN

IF IT IS INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF E-MAILS OR SOMETHING LIKE

760
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,984
OF E-MAILS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THEN IT’S NOT A HARD CASE

761
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,419
THAT, THEN IT’S NOT A HARD CASE TO MAKE IT IT MEETS THE ANYTHING

762
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,321
TO MAKE IT IT MEETS THE ANYTHING OF VALUE DEFINITION IN THE

763
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:27,822
OF VALUE DEFINITION IN THE STATUTE IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER

THE REASON WE KNOW IT’S SOMETHING OF VALUE IS TRUMP

769
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,196
SOMETHING OF VALUE IS TRUMP CALLED FOR IT TO BE USED.

770
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,731
CALLED FOR IT TO BE USED. >> RIGHT.

771
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:40,835

00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,182
AND STARTED FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS.

IT’S ONLY BECAUSE THIS STUFF IS IN PUBLIC THAT WE PAUSE.

785
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:00,856
IN PUBLIC THAT WE PAUSE. IMAGINE IF QUIETLY HE HAD SAID

IMAGINE IF QUIETLY HE HAD SAID TELL THE RUSSIANS WE WANT THEM

787
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,159
TELL THE RUSSIANS WE WANT THEM TO RELEASE THE E-MAILS.

QUESTIONING, IS IT LEGAL, IS IT ILLEGAL?

792
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,165
ILLEGAL? >> OR IMAGINE IF, I DON’T KNOW,
