so Jim look at me I'm Jim Acosta is in the Oval Office and he asks Trump well when you say you're a nationalist isn't that a dog whistle meaning that you are a white nationalist and here's this is cut number one cut number one here is the question and Trump's the beginning of Trump's response too so you hear that what kind of what he's saying so just to follow up on your comments about the Nationalists there is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that would really I never even heard that I cannot imagine that you mean I said I'm a nationalist no I never heard that theory about being a nationalist I've heard them all but I'm somebody that loves our country when I say a nationalist I don't like it when Germany's paying 1% of GDP for NATO and we're paying four point three percent I don't like that that's not fair so so he says it says the Trump do you mind if I take your word and translate it to mean that you're a racist Asian Trump said nothing about racism so you don't mind do you if I if I appropriate the word take it out of your mouth and now redefine it to mean you stink right that's what he wants to and Trump's response is detai it goes on and on from there I didn't want to play the whole thing he says we're not being treated fairly I want to take care of America first I want to make sure that I'm the prÃªt he's the President of the United States he's not the president of the world he wants to take care of the country that's why we hired him that's why we pay him although he doesn't take the money that's his job okay so now what's been explained the Costas asked his question he got the answer here is Jim Acosta later going on CNN right to tell Trump that Trump got no no Trump got it wrong Acosta knows what Trump is saying not Trump I pressed him on this in the Oval Office asked him well are you trying to say that you're a white nationalist what about these concerns out there that you're dog whistling to your base that you're sending coded messages to your base and he says well I haven't heard a theory about that and then he went on to say well you know there are trade issues and and so on as to why he he is attaching this label to himself but Anderson when you're demonizing immigrants migrants coming up from Central America trying to make their way to the United States and apply for asylum when you're demonizing Middle Easterners and making the suggestion that they're they're terrorists and so on in that Caravan without offering any proof and then calling yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white national you don't know what you're saying I know what you're saying I'm here to tell you what you're saying reminds me of when David Brooks told us that the Islamists weren't killing us because of Islam they were killing us because that we were we were racist the Islamists are saying no no we're killing we're killing you because of Islam you know no no no I know I know what you're saying I'm a journalist but a trained journalist I know which is they will take any word they can find lying on the ground and stick it back on that racist board they do not want these wounds to heal they don't want them to heal they get politically think they get political energy out of it they think they get political traction out of it so Jim Acosta Jim look at me I'm Jim Acosta his question is the important thing not the president's answer right you somebody journalist is supposed to ask questions in order to get answers no no no Jim Acosta asked questions because his questions contain all the information you need
