1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,910
I WAS GENUINELY SURPRISED
WHEN DONALD TRUMP COMPLETED YET

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,480
ANOTHER ARMS DEAL OVER THE
WEEKEND WHEN I SAW WHO IT WAS HE

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,330
WAS SELLING THE ARMS TO.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,400
IT'S
OVER $20 BILLION, OF WHICH 12

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,390
BILLION IS FINALIZED, GOING TO
QATAR, COUNTRY HE HAS RECENTLY

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,099
SPOKEN ABOUT, AND NOT IN THE I
AM ABOUT TO SELL YOU TONS OF

7
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,770
JETS SORT OF WAY.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,140
HE TWEETED
THIS AFTER HISTORY TO THE MIDDLE

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,140
EAST --

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:46,090
>>AND THE BEGINNING OF
SOMETHING NEW, LIKE CASH MONEY

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,240
THAT WE WILL GET FOR SELLING
THEM JETS.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,860
SO YEAH --

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:00,830
>>THIS WAS FINALIZED AT THE END
OF LAST YEAR UNDER BARACK OBAMA,

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,400
WHO DIDN'T CHASTISE THEM ON
TWITTER OF BEING FUNDERS OF

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,770
RADICAL TERRORISM, BUT THE
ENTIRE THING DOESN'T MAKE A LOT

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,890
OF SENSE BECAUSE TRUMP GOES
THERE, AND IMMEDIATELY

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,869
AFTERWARDS IS ATTACKING THEM,
AND THERE'S THIS BIG BLOCKADE,

18
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:17,020
DIPLOMATIC AND OTHERWISE OF THE
STATES IN THE REGION, HE'S

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,040
ATTACKING THEM.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,820
ON THE TRIP HE
SAID HE WOULD SELL QATAR BIG,

21
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,050
BEAUTIFUL WEAPONS, THAT'S BEFORE
THE INSULTS, WHICH IS BEFORE THE

22
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,890
WEAPONS SALES.

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,229
DOES HE KNOW WHAT
COUNTRY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ANY

24
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,140
OF THOSE INSTANCES?

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,810
>>AND THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO
QATAR STEPPED DOWN LAST WEEK

26
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:46,799
AFTER TWEETING NEGATIVELY ABOUT
TRUMP, AND THE WHOLE NOTION THAT

27
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,100
THINGS ARE FALLING APART FOR
AMERICA IN QATAR IS AMAZING NOW,

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,850
BECAUSE WHAT DOES HE DO AFTER
ALL THE CRITICISM?

29
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,920
WELL, LET'S

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,070
GO SELL THEM SOME ARMS.

31
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,200
>>I HAVE A THEORY, IT'S EASY FOR
A LEFTY LIKE ME TO LOOK AT THIS

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,950
AND SAY HE'S BEING INCONSISTENT,
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS

33
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,050
NOT SOME WEIRD SLIP, IT'S A
DIABOLICAL MASTER PLAN.

34
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,050
BECAUSE

35
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,910
HE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THEY
ARE FUNDERS OF TERRORISM.

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,910
WHAT

37
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,580
CAN THEY NOT DO IF YOU GET 12
BILLION OF THEIR DOLLARS?

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,580
THEY

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,820
CAN'T GIVE IT TO TERRORISTS.

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,310
>>BUT THEY ALSO CLOSED AL
JAZEERA AMERICA, SO THEY HAVE

41
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,860
ALL THAT MONEY TO PLAY WITH TOO.

42
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,490
THAT DIDN'T FIGURE INTO THE
WHOLE THING.

43
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,300
>>THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO
YOU INSTEAD OF RADICAL

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:00:00,000
TERRORISM.
