1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
it was a really interesting game of

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,339
football<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the world champions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,099
it that way

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,830
I thought Mexico were fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">play faint right so quickly did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it make</font>

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,059
cause Germany all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems they</font>

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,740
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure found a way to play against</font>

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,920
Germany they defended the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CD</font>

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">burn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes here's a bit</font>

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">desperate and they defended deep but</font>

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,380
what they did was it played them so well

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really read where all the</font>

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,070
weaknesses were and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in behind Kim</font>

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the right foot back there's a lot</font>

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,030
of space<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that was exploited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,370
went then that led up to the gold as

18
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,250
well so actually typifies how they play

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,360
didn't it all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the match</font>

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,379
pretty much let's have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

21
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,550
goal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we can run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

22
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,230
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked us through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it sir</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

23
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,129
well I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this ball and we see</font>

24
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,800
the bit late here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but just just to</font>

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,559
pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this herb in Liz Lozano</font>

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this goal but he was exploiting</font>

32
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,799
Germany's bad defense that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> defend</font>

of effort in the second half wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font>

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,810
great defending<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Mexico I thought</font>

72
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">also Mexico did well they deserve to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> win</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> no there's no doubt about that they</font>

needed he was making those saves<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he</font>

77
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,790
was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid so he came for cross just</font>

78
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,770
came for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep pass you know made</font>

79
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that he was supporting the defense</font>

80
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,450
and helping them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 20 min</font>

81
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,160
it was desperate<font color="#E5E5E5"> defending I have to say</font>

82
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,220
that but they stood up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and they I</font>

83
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they deserved in and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this</font>
