There are noses and
then, there are noses.
And for sense of smell, the
biggest is one of the best.
Elephants use their noses
for lots of things —
finding mates, identifying
family members, and probably
most important, finding food.
They’re good.
They can find food
very far away.
But how good?
To find out, researchers
set up two experiments.
To test smell at close
range, they used two buckets.
One had a plant that elephants
enjoy and the other, a plant
that smelled similar, but
that elephants don’t like.
The elephants easily detected
the subtle differences
between the two
plants by smell alone.
Then the researchers tried
the same kind of test
on a larger scale.
They built an outdoor
elephant-size version
of the classic Y maze.
Think laboratory mice
sniffing for cheese.
This was a more
difficult problem.
Sniff out the
subtle difference
between two similar
plants at a distance —
no problem for the elephants.
Now, it may seem obvious
that elephants can sniff out
the foods that they
like, but the differences
between these plants
are very subtle,
and the plants are far away.
“We can smell
when our neighbor
puts on the steak on the
barbecue next door.
They’re doing this throughout
their entire environment,
across multiple spatial
scales, for things that
don’t smell very strongly.”
It turns out elephants are
actually smell champions.
Like other mammals,
including humans,
they have scent
receptors that register
molecules in air they inhale.
The brain’s olfactory
bulb picks up
signals from those receptors.
Elephants have more
scent receptors
and a bigger olfactory
bulb than any other mammal.
And there’s that trunk, which
serves as a movable smell
antenna, which can go under
a log or into the wind.
Their noses are so good
that they help them
avoid minefields in Angola.
In fact, tests showed
that they can detect TNT.
And one study showed that
the elephants could use scent
clues alone to detect the
difference between two Kenyan
tribes: the Maasai, who
traditionally speared them,
and the Kamba, who didn’t.
Bomb detector, human
sorter, food finder —
that’s quite a nose.
