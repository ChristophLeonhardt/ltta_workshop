welcome to TV I live with us Tien ho from pally research tin where Google is synonymous with search in most parts of the globe the giant is still struggling with recognition in China where the world's largest internet market where local rival Baidu dominates however is there a tide change in the words I know Baidu recently switched to a new advertising system Phoenix nest can you tell me a bit about that new system and how that's going to affect Baidu earnings I think Phoenix system is a better monetization system and in the past you know by do basic have an open bidding system and for the ranking and I know how much you pay you know how much I pay and versus Google and then nobody know you know how much you paint so the ranking will be based on how much you're willing to pay it's not how much you're willing to pay more than others right so but I do try to change it and also by you added a lot to related in the world so when you were you know put some ads there can be more intelligent and can generate more search results so much more towards Google model actually so in in the short term we are going to see some revenue drop back because the conversion itself needs you know anytime need education and need to realize the value of the new system so with Google doubling its sales forces are they going to be able to capitalize on that short term Coco's problem is it's the sales execution strategy it's not how many people they have and Coco you know like in in in Europe they also in China they always rely on for a agency most of for a agency their customers are big account but in China online search most of the merciful medium business some small to the extent they even didn't have a website to begin from so you need to develop website for them first so what in China is big huge like you need a I am a how to say a group of soldier and massive deploy them to every corner of China to recruit us you know customers that's what you need it so it's not only the number of sales people but it's also a refocus of overall strategy and aligning with local Chinese community yeah so do you think Google has any interest in buying a Chinese web company to gain sure I think that you know we have only two major search companies that by doing Google so who can they buy they can't go there but I do write it's not they have to rely on themself I guess so in terms of share price by do is reaching new highs at what four hundred forty dollars a share it's trading at 50 times 2010 EPS think Google's only treating that 22 times can you trust those numbers why are they so late it I think that there's the one thing if you look at the China stock even if the company is a pretty unique dominant player normally they will treat at the premium you look at by do you look at see chip you look at edu they all traded away beyond peers because the premium is the number one yeah there's number one they probably the only one so is by do going to two thousand dollars a share are they the next school I think by do they viewed as next Google viewed as a Google in China but definitely you know in my initiation report I said clearly if I do it's not Google and if I don't want to become Google they have to email undergo a structural change revolutionary change and which could slow down their growth and the unless they say I don't want to go that change so currently we haven't seen the determination of making that change yet thank you for being with us you welcome
