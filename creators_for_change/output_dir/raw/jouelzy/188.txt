00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
Hey guys! Jouelzy here, live from Accra, Ghana.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,170
Hence why you might hear some of the background noice

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,840
and the church service that's happening on a
Saturday afternoon at 4 p.m.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,080
so yes, I am still in Ghana. I am here until January 6th.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
For those who have inquired about me selling

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,780
some African print wears, I have obliged.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,020
And I have a quick sale happening at

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,260
accrawears.bigcartel.com

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,320
go 'head and get you a piece.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,900
Now, I have not done

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,200
a proper #SmartBrownGirl video

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,200
in a clean minute.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,100
and I felt that it was my duty to come back to the #SmartBrownGirls and engage you guys

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,040
in a very pivotal discussion that needs to happen.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,379
So this past week on my Facebook feed

16
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,799
there's been an article that's circulating around with kind of mixed opinions

17
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,789
and very interesting discussion that's been happening.

18
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:50,420
and I thought this is the perfect topic to talk about with my #SmartBrownGirls

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,820
ArtParasite posted an article submitted anonymously by a young lady entitled...

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,160
THE UGLY SIDE OF BEING A SINGLE, ATTRACTIVE AND AVAILABLE HETEROSEXUAL WOMAN,

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,060
Detailing her sexual mistreatment

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,770
where she has gone into relationships and
situation as a consenting

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,370
in a sometimes casual sexual relationship

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,370
and had her boundaries

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,370
or body...

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,180
or just...

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,450
a whole lot to me that just sounded like sexual assault and sometimes rape, but to her...

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,150
felt like were men being too aggressive and just 
being dicks

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,710
I gu...ugh...let's talk about this

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,640
The ugly side to being attractive, single and available is not rape.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,240
This is very important to address because we live in a world where

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,840
Steve Harvey has built the bulk of his career and is now slanging bacon off

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,460
of putting the onus of a relationship entirely on to a woman's shoulders.

34
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,030
Where the bad behavior of men

35
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,250
is acknowledged as a problem that women
have to solve.

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,930
And we need to firmly address what rape is.

37
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,150
And even if you are consenting to casual sex

38
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,910
because you're an adult

39
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,560
who has rights to your own body

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,840
and exploring being a sexual being...

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,320
That you are still allowed to have boundaries.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,480
Firm boundaries that protect your body.

43
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,829
Casual sex is not code for...

44
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:12,329
"Easy"

45
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,969
"whore"

46
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,160
rape or let me do what I want to do with her even when she tells me no.

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,740
Rape culture is so ingrained into the patriarchy of our society,

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,680
that casual sex, for women, is often pushed into the dark and unsavory space,

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,580
that allows women to be victim-blamed.

50
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,340
If you have not read the article, please stop and read it here.

51
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,980
I've linked it in the "i" that should drop down right above and the description box below.

52
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,209
There’s a few incidents, in the article, that I can relate to.

53
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,100
Like a guy refusing to put a condom on and pushing himself inside of you.

54
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,709
Men attempting to forcefully push your head down, or shoving their whole entire dick in your

55
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,329
face because you're obliged to give them head.

56
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,329
I come from the firm school of saying "No".

57
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,209
Hell to the no. Fuck your feelings, no.

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,140
And I’ve still been caught in struggles where men don’t understand the word "No".

59
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,900
What was so apparent in this article was that this young lady had no boundaries to begin with,

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,320
further pushing her out in the cold.

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,480
When a “lover” who shows up at your door with TWO other men,

62
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,700
because you “get to have 3 guys at once.”

63
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,260
You spend hours with them haggling you while you say no?

64
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,260
How many different ways?

65
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,640
Let’s be clear, this is not victim-blaming.

66
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,820
But we need to have this discussion,

67
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,560
to empower young women...

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
older women...

69
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,140
all women

70
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,740
that it’s okay to have boundaries that keep you safe

71
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,290
even when they make others uncomfortable.

72
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,290
At no point should your obligation

73
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,290
to keeping the peace come at the cost

74
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,770
of violence against your own body.

75
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,630
We have all been there,

76
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,140
where we have been uncomfortable and said nothing,

77
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,860
because we didn't want to
change the mood...

78
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,240
we don't want to ruin the night

79
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
we really like this person

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,260
and for some reason we thought

81
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,460
being uncomfortable would make us keep on liking them...

82
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,410
even though in reality, in non-likeness, when we have our common sense...

83
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,989
and remember that if a person likes us

84
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,309
then they should respect us.

85
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:11,309
But somehow we're in these moments

86
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:13,880
where we're just willing to be disrespected.

87
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,240
in order to keep up someone
else's comfort.

88
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,260
We've done it.

89
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,260
When it comes to sexual assault and rape,

90
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,669
we are so trained

91
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,569
that our first reaction is to immediately think what did I do to get myself here?

92
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,689
How did I cause this to happen?

93
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,689
We immediately blame ourselves

94
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,860
for the violence that happens to us perpetuated by others,

95
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,360
that we do everything but set boundaries

96
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,220
to keep from seeing it as sexual assault or rape.

97
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,240
The author closes out with...

98
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,940
“I’ve never been raped,

99
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,940
and there's a few nights I don’t remember,

100
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,680
but I’ve been coerced time after time and time again.”

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,140
Dear Lord, Love. A few examples she gave actually were rape.

102
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,480
And don’t disvalue how hard it is to get a man off top of you when he is inside of you.

103
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,900
No matter how skinny or small he seems in real life.

104
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,920
At the point when you're attempting to get him off of you

105
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,480
and he's exerting power
to remain on top and inside of you

106
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,400
you have crossed over

107
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
the area of assault and rape.

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
At this point there is no
happy moment to save

109
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,220
because my no means no.

110
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,760
so f*ck him and his feelings

111
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,540
and be as aggressive as you need to be

112
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,940
to get him up and off of you.

113
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,060
Be as loud and scream and say the word rape if you need to.

114
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,420
Whether is a casual sex, a lover, a long time friend...

115
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,380
a husband or a boyfriend

116
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,460
You as a woman and a man are allowed to consent to sex

117
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,260
and then stop during it.

118
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
How innocently asking for a break,

119
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,620
to pee, to get up, to take a break

120
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,160
to let someone know that you're in pain, you're uncomfortable...

121
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,400
you're body doesn't feel good in this moment.

122
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,120
To just stop because it’s overwhelming, it hurts,

123
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,200
it’s your damn body and you want to stop...

124
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Can so quickly turn into a moment,

125
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
where your body is not yours

126
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
because society is teaching men

127
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,400
that women’s bodies deserve no respect.

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,300
This is not about not participating in casual sex.

129
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Because you can save yourself,

130
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,040
be as a pure as white doves and white cotton bed sheets,

131
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,870
and still find yourself in this position,

132
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,870
because you weren't taught

133
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,780
that you have full rights over your body.

134
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,220
Define what boundaries you need

135
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,760
how you want your body to be approached and

136
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,220
and always understand

137
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
that when your "no" is not heard

138
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,659
you have crossed over to

139
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,799
sexual assault and rape.

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,659
Check out my
book

141
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,930
"Send It On" a collection of essays that
highlight some of what

142
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,940
I discussed in this video.

143
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,370
And you can also watch my video and read my blog post

144
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,140
about the "Aftermath of Being a Victim of Rape".

145
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,480
you can click on either
the "i"s that drop down here which have both links

146
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,980
and as always it will linked in the Description box down below.

147
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,030
Thanks for watching!

148
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,970
I encourage you to join the #SmartBrownGirl discussion

149
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,560
and I will have a blog post posted in...the "i"! [info bar in right corner]

150
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,280
and description box down below.

151
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
to keep it going

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,840
and encouraging #SmartBrownGirls to own the rights to their body

153
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,760
Nobody can tell you what
to do with your being.

154
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,090
No matter what situation you are in....

155
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,120
how much or little clothing you
have on...

156
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,560
someone always needs to respect your rights and your words.

157
00:07:30,560 --> 00:00:00,000
Deuces #SmartBrownGirls!
