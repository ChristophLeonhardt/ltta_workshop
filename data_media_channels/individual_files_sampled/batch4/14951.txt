the third installment of the guardians of the galaxy's franchise is getting put on ice we're gonna talk about that today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel bummer guardians of the galaxy is on hold if you won't remember a few weeks ago maybe longer than a few weeks ago anyway a few weeks ago I reported on the fact that the director of the guardians of the galaxy franchise James Gunn had been fired by Disney after offensive and repulsive tweets joking about oh let's see rape and pedophilia pedophilia they surfaced and while I agree with freedom of speech of course I do if you are employed by a company like Disney whose primary content production caters to children it's just not a wise move to make jokes about those types of things not long after he had been fired the cast of the series including Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Vin Diesel Dave Bautista Bradley Cooper Sean Gunn Karen Gillan Michael Rooker and Palm Clemente F wrote an open letter in support of James Gunn I'm sure you guys remember this but it read in part we fully support James Gunn we were all shocked by his abrupt firing last week and have intentionally waited these 10 days to respond in order to think pray listen and discuss yadda yadda yadda and the first paragraph of their letter closes with this we are discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him and again I assert like I did in the first video talking about this it's not conspiracy theories when the subject of hand literally put it out there in black and white on Twitter on the world wide web for everyone to see anyway the film direction was clearly in limbo at that point they were wondering who was going to come in for the third installment of the franchise to direct well things are not looking great so if you were holding your breath for them to name a director and for production to begin you better put that on hold or you're gonna pass out her The Hollywood Reporter production is officially on hold and crew members have been released to look for their work and considering they were slated to start pre-production like now it is not looking promising now on one hand hashtag I don't care especially for the cast that wrote that letter supporting James Gunn and his rapist pedophilic tweets but for the crew members the gaffers the production assistants the costume department and directors the props people the people who are not making millions of dollars per film I do feel bad for them it sucks to lose a job because of the reprehensible irresponsible actions or words of another employee it stinks to be punished for poor decision-making on the part of others now the militant side of me is conflicting with the sympathetic side of me yes I do have a heart people believe it or not now I want to know what you guys think should they can the entire project or just hire a new director and risk I don't know a change in directorial continuity and take a financial hit with the third installment let us know in the comments thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
