today on the bottom line Gary shilling on the big surprises ahead for the economy and the markets Alibaba best-performing mega cap stock this year how high can it go and lastly the secret life Ismail beads hello everyone welcome to the bottom line I'm Henry Blodgett big THANK YOU to Nasdaq for hosting us here in Times Square big THANK YOU to fidelity investments for sponsoring the show we're joined today by Gary shilling of a Gary shilling & Company Sarah silverstein has the rundown on one of the biggest stocks of the year Alibaba and as always we'll talk about the market one of the best performing mega cap stocks this year Alibaba is up a hundred percent for the year now 400 billion dollar market cap revival in those of the US tech giant's era Silverstein's here to tell us about it and what's next well what has happen for Alibaba lately they had an incredible earnings report David Tepper announced a huge 500 million dollar stake in the company and like you said Alibaba is up a hundred percent Amazon's up 30 percent year-to-date and Alibaba is actually starting to close the gap between the market cap of of Amazon which is four hundred and sixty-four billion dollars so I thought it'd be fun for us to sort of look at the differences in the companies and the valuations because the revenue of Baba is 26 billion over the last 12 months amazon's 150 billion but the operating margins of Alibaba are 33 percent versus Amazon's 2 percent and Alibaba has much stronger earnings growth and 95 percent versus Amazon which has been down seventy-seven percent so and I think that one of the interesting things is that Alibaba trades it's such a lower multiple compared to Amazon I think in Northern Trust capital market says that Alibaba is trading at 25 times it's 2019 earnings while Amazon is at 65 times it's 2019 earnings so the big difference there is that there's a lot more growth baked into the expected earnings of Alibaba but that's still a huge difference and so where's obviously one of the difference between Amazon Alibaba Alibaba has a business that looks eBay which is where the margins come from so much a higher margin business than retailing Alibaba is in many businesses and the portfolio managers that I talked to say look there's so much opportunity in China and they own so much of the market that there's a huge upside really that's the question where are we in the market penetration that Alibaba has access to in China how big can this get long-term China does have the largest internet population I think it's over 500 million so they have a lot of they have a lot there and what I have seen people talk about is that the the competition between the two will certainly come as they both try to get international and UBS there everybody all of the analysts are pretty bullish on Alibaba I think 47 buys 3 holds 0 sells very similar to Amazon UBS says the risk to the share price is very skewed 2 to 1 on the upside where they see the upside is up 56% to 258 dollars a share the downside is 29 like down 29% to 118 dollars a share so that seems to be the general consensus thank you Sarah great to have you thank you today's fidelity insight is from jurrien timmer the director of global macro at fidelity investments in honor of the Jackson Hole economic symposium this weekend the first thing that Timur points out is that the Fed and the markets have very different ideas of what the rate hike schedule will look like the Fed according to the most recent dot plot is showing that they expect one more hike or consensuses one more hike this year three and 2018 and three more in 2019 however the forward curve the market is pricing in only two more rate hikes not seven before the end of 2019 but Timur points out that historically the stock market has held up to fed tightening especially in times where corporate earnings growth is strong so if you look at the future cash flow or the future earnings of a company that will be discounted at the risk-free rate so the higher the rates go the more discounted the future cash flows are and that could depress the value the current value of vet cashflow however what Zimmer is saying is that if you have earnings roles to offset the increase discount rate that there isn't as much to worry about in the market market and economy have confounded many economists and strategists over the last 10 years so it is a great privilege to welcome somebody who got it right before it happened Gary shilling of a Gary shilling and company welcome so great to have you here let's start with the big picture seven years ago when we were coming out of the big financial crisis you wrote a book called the age of deleveraging the consensus at that point was we were headed for wild inflation because of all the mundane printing you said no it's going to be different and laid it out for us now we're seven years into that so where are we well I think we're about where I thought we'd be yeah we are in this process of working off the excesses that were built up in the 80s and 90s and and of course they then we had the housing bubble and and and collapse in the 2000s but it's really a matter of working down a lot of those excesses plus the fact that we're in a globalized world which has added another big dimension to the whole thing I mean in other words when you're talking about labor supplies and and productive capacity you got to look at it globally and there's an awful lot of that out there now so all these things have contributed to a period of relatively slow growth in that book I said we thought we'd have 2% real GDP growth annually until this whole thing was was completed and it's averaged 2.1 percent so far dead on and so where do we go from here I think it's more of the same until something happens and that something is probably going to be massive fiscal stimuli you know if you look at at at real income growth purchasing power in in the Europe and West and North America there's been virtually no growth for over a decade and that's and that's everybody if you take off a top 10% most people have had declining purchasing power and they're in the words of that old movie Network they're mad as hell I'm not going to take it anymore and I think that has resulted in the populism that's what brexit is all about that's what Trump elected I think it's putting a lot of pressure on politicians to do something now monetary policy has proved to be impotent it simply does not revive the economy we go into the details on that well I think it leaves it up the fiscal policy and I think we will see massive fiscal stimuli the two areas that I think are most likely our military spending and with the Republicans in control in Washington if they can get their act together on anything but they point to you know China building the artificial lives in South China Sea and Russia reviving their empire and Japan getting out from under therefore sort of neutrality so I think military spending on the other horses infrastructure spending which we obviously sorely need in this country and that's pretty much back to cross across the board so I think any politician who wants to get reelected is probably going to respond to this so that's one of the that's that's the one thing out of the whole Trump agenda which i think is going to happen and do you are you still confident of that given the seeming inability of the Trump administration and Congress to do anything at all it seemed like infrastructure spending as you point out in your latest note we are at almost record lows of GDP our country is falling apart everybody on both sides of the aisle seems to agree time to spend and yet nothing happens well we do have an event coming up the first Tuesday in November of 19 of 2018 pick a random date the next election and I think that's going to put a lot of pressure on on Congress and the administration to get their act together and do something now now it'll take two or three years for infrastructure programs you know the federal government may spend the money may enact the money but it's actually spent by the states and they have to go through an environmental impact statements and the zoning requirements and the contracts and so on so it takes two or three years to really get geared up in in 2009 after those so-called shovel-ready projects two years later only 30 percent of that money had been spent but the point is I think there's a lot of pressure for them to show enough progress by the election next year that that voters are gonna say yeah okay these guys are doing something for me they won't have much of a results in job creation but well I think they'll get their act together the thing about Congress is that they they State undoing anything look at social security I mean they should have done something on Social Security and Medicare the day that post-war babies were born you know what was happening that's pretty easy prediction what they have hesitated that's the way they have what they they tend to do than the necessary one force and maybe that's brinksmanship in a way but I rather suspect they'll be trying to get their act together before the election next year and one of the things that surprised me in your latest research note was your prediction that despite the fact that we're still in the a Jindal ever G leveraging 2% growth you think the economy will accelerate to 3 to 3 and a half percent what drives that yeah well that's that's is that's it's massive fiscal stimuli and and I think there's plenty of resources to do it now some people say well productivity is low and you don't have enough increase in the labor force but but productivity is very funny it it it doesn't it doesn't react to capital spending if a big capital spending did not necessarily give you productivity growth but what does is the aging the maturation the growing in sizes of new technologies you look at things like like robotics and and biotechnology or emini maybe even self-driving vehicles they start very small they grow like Topsy but they finally get big enough to drive the productivity needle so I think that's coming and the other in terms of manpower you know the reason the unemployment rate is is where it is now it's not because of increase in employment is because people dropped out of the labor force the unemployment rate is the ratio of people actively looking to work to only denominator those people opposed those with jobs some of people drop out of the labor force as they did a lot of people didn't think they could find jobs and of course opposed to our babies someone retired and younger people stayed in school they thought they'd get better jobs with more education we had a tremendous decline in what's called the labor participation rate that the percentage of people are either looking for worker and actively employed a lot of those people are now coming off a bench people over 65 their labor participation rates going up a lot of them don't have the money to retire they were lousy savers but also they're in better health and they want to want to stay active and then you look at on a global basis boy there's plenty of capacity and labor so I don't see any inhibitors to that growth and I think the fiscal stimulus is going to be the driving force on demand-side let's talk more about jobs and wages lots of people are concerned that the Fed is already behind the curve they don't see the pressure building up unemployment is low wages are going to accelerate and cause inflation you say that that's dead wrong yeah I think that's true you know I and I think the Fed itself is of course of this conviction that that wages are about ready to explode and and create an inflation but you know on the latest our latest insight a monthly newsletter we talked about this I talk about all the factors that are there globalization again you've got to look at these things globally not just in the US and assuming Trump doesn't build up a wall completely around the country protectionist wall you have to look at this and the availability of labour and and productive capacity on it on a Nash on a global basis within the US as I mentioned there are a lot of people who dropped out of the labor force who are coming back and then you have other things that are pressing wages of the jobs have been created in this expansion have been in low-paid industries leisure and hospitality room clerks people amazed in hotels waiters and so on they haven't been in they haven't been in manufacturing and in a high-paid high-paid areas and unionization unionization knowing the private sector has virtually disappeared and even in the even in the public sector it's under fire and and union workers tend to get paid more than the non-union people you've had a you've had a number a number of factors that are that are depressing wages and then you've you haven't had the big productivity growth yet and I think employers basically say hey IB I'd love to pay more but if I don't have you don't have the productivity people aren't producing more for our work how can you pay this without it coming out of profits and of course a lot of say we can't raise wages that we can't raise prices they alternate because of the domestic and international competition so I think you've got a lot of forces which are holding down wages and are probably going to continue for some time and a lot of people argue that with immigration slowing and population growth slowing that the growth potential growth rate of the economy is at best 1 to 2 percent yeah we're saying there is a lot of slack still in the laborer market that's not captured in that and one of the things one things Henry to keep in mind that the easiest forecast is the projection of whatever is happening now will last indefinitely because everybody says oh right on brother that's what I see you know you're absolutely right an easy forecast now is slow growth forever and you know they're the people who say that everything that could be invented that's going to move the productivity needle has been you know kind of a modern mole to Xion area others say well the labor force restrictions that we just don't have the population growth but but even even our calculations are even without a lot of these people coming off the bench who dropped out of the labor force earlier and they and they are starting to that there's just going to be enough natural growth in the in the economy in terms of labor force that we have we have reasonable productivity growth we can have three three and a half percent real GDP growth and that's almost twice what we've had so far in this expansion and yet you still think that even in that environment stocks will not do particularly well well stocks stocks are expensive you know by any measures and and you look you know one of my favorites is Bob Shiller's ten year you know cyclically adjusted p/e if you will and of course if you a lot of this is dependent on history but if you look at if you look at the historical level of that and this is this is over a ten-year period turn out the cyclical movements if you look on that stocks are about 40 40 to 50 percent higher than that long-term norm now you can say that long-term norm is no longer applicable well I think if you look at it stocks in a lot of ways they are they are expensive and and and and so it doesn't say that they're going to fall apart but it just says they're starting at a high level you know if you look if you look long term in terms of stocks I mean you start with you start with the economy and and then you look at corporate profits corporate profits grow about in step with the nominal economy they almost have to you can't seek profit share either going up and definitely or down indefinitely so then the only difference between stocks in effect the growth in the in anomaly khana me is the price earnings is it going up or is it going down and it's and it's it's cyclically gone up and I think it's probably sickly they're gonna go down so so I think that even with resumption reasonable growth you can't expect they're kind of you know you can't expect double-digit stock stockings or 20% like we had five years back to back to back to back and in the 1990s that you know it was they say trees don't grow to the sky and you've been very clear and saying bull markets don't die of old age and as we all learned in the 1990s they can last a lot longer than everybody thinks that's gonna be playing out now but what is it what would trigger a correction or a sideways oh well there are two things at least in the modern area which have brought bull markets to an end one is a shock and we saw that in the late 90s with the dot-com blow-off and then again we saw it in the mid 2000s with the subprime mortgage collapse you can have a kind of a shock the other thing and and there may be a shock out there I mean you know I've been I've been looking for much lower oil prices that could be enough of a shock because there's a lot of heavy leverage among energy companies or you could have a blow-up in the Middle East yeah you name it you know some kind of shock the other thing that has ended it is the Federal Reserve tightening and the Fed the Fed they start when they see what they think is an overheating economy they start to type now they don't intend to precipitate a recession but by my count in 11 of 12 tries in the post-world War two period they've gotten a recession only one soft landing in the mid 90s now on top of the feds normal raising interest rates that they're doing they're now trying to unwind this quantitative easing this huge balance sheet they've never had that before and given the lack of success they've had just using money conventional monetary policy interest rates when they put on top of that trying to unwind that balance sheet what are the odds of their pulling this one off without without a recession now that doesn't mean the recession is in the mediate future and the Fed and the other central banks are being very very careful because they had this taper tantrum remember in 2014 when when Bernanke talked about about simply reducing the the quantitative easing and the markets really reacted violently so they were trying to do it very very carefully but you know sooner or later if we don't get a shock in the meanwhile the Fed will will do the usual job now that could be back to be years down the road though this is not a this is not a easy forecast in terms of timing so stocks uncertain you still have a startling prediction for bonds which is that the 10-year will go to 1% well you know Henry I started in 1981 when they 30-year bond yield at fifteen point two percent I said we're entering the bond rally of a lifetime it's now 2.8 percent I think it's headed for two percent in the ten years for one percent now I say why do I say that well you have a safe haven effect of Treasuries you know when the world is in trouble even if we start to trouble Treasuries benefit it's interesting because they are a safe haven secondly I think we're more likely to see deflation than inflation and that's very favorable for for Treasuries lower yields higher prices and and the third thing is that Treasuries now lower yields are much higher than they are in almost any other industrialized country you look at Germany you know their 10-year yields are below 1% and so foreign investors have an advantage in investing in Treasuries they get a yield spread of course they have the dollar to worry about whether the headset or not but there is a distinct yield spread for foreigners between their own sovereigns and US Treasuries you said something very interesting about online shopping which is as Amazon grows and others having a complete demolishing effect on the red-breasted retail base you said that in retail stores 30 to 50 percent of purchases are impulse purchases and these don't happen online yeah yeah that's a very interesting aspect of this because you can say well sure the bricks and mortar retailers may suffer if people shift to online but if they're spending the same amount what's the difference in terms of the overall economy well the point is that there is this much greater impulse buying and that's what stores count on they get you in there hey I go over to Cosmo occasionally I go in for one or two why it's like well the whole cart full exhibit number one and and and and there is this impulse buying which which which is very much cater to now the Amazon sir will they you know they're trying to do this they say you know you order something have you thought about this or here's something related to this but they do not thus far nearly have the have the reaction to that so there is that there is that aspect and of course this this is this is this is deflationary it's very much so because the cost of absorbing this stuff from Amazon is very different than bricks and mortar stores and then you say what are they going to do with all the retail space and we've been we've been interested in some of the second and tertiary malls from the down side because because you know they are folding and a lot of in some cases the mall owners are are getting the are just given a key back to their lenders and you talk about that being deflationary you also point out that the inflation statistics that everybody looks at maybe actually inflated by owner equivalent rent I thought was very interesting process but it's it's a it's a way how does the government account for for for houses that people own and they used two years ago they would treat it the houses of the actual sale prices part of the Consumer Price Index well they said what was so few people learned and filed there that that isn't that isn't realistic so then they went to what's called owners equivalent rent and the and here is it it's it sounds fictitious but if there's a there's a there's a logic to it they assume that you and I if we own our house that we rented from ourselves and that is called owners equivalent rent and it's about 25 percent of the Consumer Price Index well the rents they use are race are based on houses they're actually are rented and the rents have gone up tremendously recently as you know because people are renting rather than buying houses so if you take that out of the CPI the CPI goes from I think year-over-year 1.7 percent of 0.9% just taking that out now you say well should you take it out well I don't know I don't think most people I don't think about him renting my house myself as a boy am I making a am I paying a huge red and then turn around say boy am I getting a huge so in summary the age of deleveraging was right 7 years ago here we are everyone now thinks it will continue forever you say that that is the mistake that we make and what we're going to move into is very rapid growth the economy faster than people think but that will not be good for stocks and it will be good for bonds I would say it'll be bad for stocks but well I think that we may not see quite the exuberance that we've seen in the past and this is probably gonna take some time to develop this this rapid growth we have a few more minutes with you love to talk about some other topics bees for example you say that the shilling apiaries your bee colonies you just harvested the honey now it is time to medicate the colonies can we talk about bees for a second what does that mean well of course well honey bees have been beset with a number of diseases and pests in the last two decades matter of fact they're very few or surprisingly few amateur beekeepers left anymore because people uses you know they open the hive once in the spring and see if everyone's okay and then take off a harvest on the fall now I've got to be in that hive at least once a month and this time of year more frequently than that and I treat for seven different maladies and and and we just took off the honey I do that in early August to get these treatments on before the bees go into their winter cluster I'll explain that in a minute but the idea is that I want to get the honey off that we're going to eat before I put these medications on but there are all kinds of things there's a parasitic mite called borough of Vai ROA that hangs on the bees and hang and sucks out their their juices and if you don't treat that hive for varroa absolutely guaranteed possibly it'll be dead in two years no exceptions and then there's a there's a bee diarrhea and there a couple of bacterial diseases and some viruses and so on and so forth and and interesting enough though bees are not going to disappear from from the earth they're they're 2.7 million honeybee colonies in this country today two years ago there were two and a half million so they actually have increased but it's getting much more expensive and time-consuming to keep the light the bees alive and producing you also mention this fascinating thing that bee hive and colony over the winter is just women yes the men in be society actually don't have to do all that not very tough break guys no they you have three castes of honeybees you have the queen and she is a complete female she and she's just a lame machine a good queen can lay 2,000 eggs a day in the hive right now they're fifty to sixty thousand bees and a good hive she's a lame machine then the worker bees are incomplete females they they they do all the work they gather the nectar they process it they feed the queen they guard the hive they do all the work but they cannot they not cannot reproduce then you have the drones the males they don't they can't sting they don't clean up the hive they don't go any way uncle any work and and the only thing they do is mate with the queen and when she made she mates with a dozen to twenty of them that's the way of avoiding inbreeding and and the ones that fly the highest and the fastest get to mate with a queen and they promptly die you know after they mate with big smiles on their faces anyway but but the thing is that a drone has no father a drone is an unfertilized egg if a queen drops a an egg and does not drop a sperm on top of it turns into a drone if she drops a sperm on top of it it turns into a female worker bee so as long as the Queen has eggs she can make all the drones she wants so at the end of the season the worker bees and I've seen this they literally drag the drones out and push them over the edge of the hive I mean there's I got to carry that baggage through the winter because see honey bees are off in the old world there's lots of new world bees wasps Yellow Jackets Hornets bumble bees and so on they hibernate they only need to make enough honey to feed their their larvae honey bees don't hibernate they're all from the new world they came here with the European settlers they call them the white man's fly and and the Indians call them the white man's fly and and but they don't hibernate so they're in the hive in the winter now now if you're in the hive in the winter you got to keep warm and to keep warm you got to eat and that's why they've honey they thought it was because you like honey right no they making honey to get through the winter now they're working fools as long as there's nectar and a place to put the put the honey they'll make more than they need and where we come in in this climate this New York area they need about 60 pounds for hive to get through the winter and we take off the rest but anyway they are in that they are in that hive and the in-center and they're in this cluster bisected by these frames are eating their way through that hive and the colder it is a tighter that cluster is to to keep warm you mentioned in your recent note you recently had your 80th birthday you've had an amazing 60 year career and what you do and your own firms just tremendously inspiring for all of us from the vantage point of 80 what's your advice for the rest of us what's important in a good question Henry I think it's probably to keep active to keep busy to do what you want what you really enjoy you know we in the West believe the only go through life once other other other religions other other other parts of the world they have a different view about reincarnation and so on but basically in the West we believe you go through life once and so you say well ok let's let's let's make it count let's let's let's have something that we're doing and I think anybody works at a job that they don't really enjoy not not every job not every aspect of it for goodness sakes you and I have times of downtime but on balance if you don't really like it you know boy you're worsen you're wasting some precious time the only thing you're short of in this world is time ultimately that's the only thing you're only short of and I think you really need to say how am I going to how what am I going to do between now and death how am i and you can say that at age 80 you can say that age 21 like they're doing my life how am I going to how am I going to achieve what I want how am I going to do something that is that is going to help other people and and I mean I've got involved with a call the Episcopal preaching foundation we promote preaching Episcopal Church it's it's it's that beekeeping or my passions if you will outside of what I do professionally but you know the things you feel that you're doing something that's gonna benefit other people and you know you always have this ego ego feeling you'd like to you'd like to think that it's got some lasting effect beyond your your time on this earth Gary it's a privilege to have you thank you so much my pleasure Henry oh it always is that's it for this week thank you very much for joining us big THANK YOU to fidelity investments for sponsoring the bottom line and a big THANK YOU to Nasdaq for hosting us here in Times Square we'll see you next week
