AINSLEY: SOUNDS GOOD.
ABBY: IT WILL BE 70 AND SUNNY.
WHAT A PERFECT DAY.
BRIAN: HE DOES EVERYTHING ROYAL.
>> HE A KNIGHT OVER THERE.
>>> KELLYANNE CONWAY COUNSELOR
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP JOINS US FROM
THE NORTH LAWN.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING.
STEVE: THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, I'M SURE YOU SAW
THIS, HE TWEETED FOUR MINUTES
AGO.
WOW, WORD SEEMS TO BE COMING OUT
THAT THE OBAMA FBI SPIED ON THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED
INFORMANT.
ANDREW McCARTHY SAYS THERE IS
NO DOUBT THEY HAD ONE
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT IN THE
CAMPAIGN.
IF SO THIS IS BIGGER THAN
WATERGATE.
HE HAD THIS ONE AS WELL.
>> CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA,
WE'RE NOW INTO THE SECOND YEAR
OF THE GREATEST WITCH-HUNT IN
AMERICAN HISTORY, THERE IS STILL
NO COLLUSION AND NO OBSTRUCTION.
THE ONLY COLLUSION DONE BY
DEMOCRATS WHO WERE UNABLE TO WIN
AN ELECTION DESPITE SPENDING FAR
MORE MONEY.
WE DON'T NEED TO GET YOUR
REACTION, KELLYANNE, BUT WHAT DO
YOU SAY?
>> WE LIKE THE PRESIDENT SAY
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS OWN BEST
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.
I OFTEN ENCOURAGE HIM TO INTER
FACE WITH THE PUBLIC DIRECTLY.
I GLAD HE DOES THAT THROUGH HIS
VAST SOCIAL MEDIA REACH AND
IT IS DEMOCRATIZATION.
AMERICANS ARE CUTTING OUT THE
MIDDLEMEN.
THE MIDDLEMEN DON'T LIKE IT.
COMMUNICATES WITH THE WORLD AND
AMERICANS INSTANTLY ALL AT THE
SAME TIME.
TAKE THE TWO TWEETS TOGETHER.
SEE WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS
THINKING ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE
OF PLAY.
THAT A YEAR PLUS INTO THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, WE KNOW A
FEW THINGS, BUT WHAT WE KNOW
CRISPLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY IS
THAT AS THESE REVELATIONS ARE
MAKING THEIR WAY FORWARD, IT
LOOKS LIKE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
MAY IN FACT HAVE BEEN SURVEILED.
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS AN
INFORMANT THERE.
WE'LL SEE AS THE PRESIDENT LIKES
TO SAY, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WE'LL SEE WHAT THE FACTS MAY
REVEAL.
I THINK THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DIG
AND CONJECTURING OVER A YEAR,
SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHAT THEY WISH
FOR.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS PERSON
WAS HOPING TO GAIN.
MAYBE HE OR SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
LISTENING MORE CAREFULLY WHAT
OUR DIGITAL STRATEGY WAS AND OUR
50% DIGITAL ADS, 50%
CONVENTIONAL TELEVISION RADIO
ADS.
MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
LISTENING TO ME SIX OR SEVEN
TIMES A DAY, WHY WE'RE GOING
BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA.
WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS HEADED TO
PLACES LIKE WISCONSIN, AND
MICHIGAN AND PLACES HE WON,
REPUBLICANS HADN'T WON IN A VERY
LONG TIME BUT THE PRESIDENT AND
HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN SO
COOPERATIVE WITH THIS
INVESTIGATION.
WE'RE $10 MILLION PLUS INTO IT.
WE'RE OVER A YEAR.
EVERYBODY HAS TURNED OVER THE
DOCUMENTS.
THEY HAVE BEEN IN TO VISIT THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL.
THEY HAVE BEEN UP ON CAPITOL
HILL SHARING INFORMATION.
YOU SEE RELEASE OF TRANSCRIPTS
PEOPLE ARE COOPERATIVE.
THIS PRESIDENT ALSO DOESN'T LET
IT HIM DISTRACT HIM.
I SAT IN THE SENATE REPUBLICAN
LUNCH TWO DAYS AGO, YOU HEARD
SENATOR AFTER SENATOR, TELL THIS
PRESIDENT HE IS THE MOST
SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT IN THEIR
LIFETIMES, IN 16 MONTHS OF TAX
CUTS AND REGULATORY REDUCTIONS
AND GETTING CLOSE TO MAKING,
MAKING CONVERSATIONS IF NOT
DEALS WITH NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH
KOREA, HE HAS BEEN HERE
BASICALLY SEVEN WEEKS SINCE
DIRECTOR POMPEO, NOW SECRETARY
OF STATE POMPEO WENT TO
NORTH KOREA.
SEVEN WEEKS OF BIG ACTIVITY, 70
YEARS OF WAR BETWEEN THE KOREAS.
IT'S THIS PRESIDENT LEADERSHIP
HELPS HOSTAGES COME HOME AND
SOME OTHER GREAT THINGS HAPPEN.
BRIAN: COULD EASILY PUNT ON THIS
QUESTION BUT
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ACTUALLY
SAYS THIS, AT LEAST ONE
GOVERNMENT INFORMANT MET SEVERAL
TIMES WITH PAGE AND
PAPADOPOULOS.
SO SOME GOVERNMENT INFORMANT
WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMP.
COULD YOU TELL ME IF, COULD YOU
JUST TELL ME IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA
OF WHO THAT MIGHT BE?
>> I DON'T HAVE AN IDEA.
LET ME SAY SOMETHING MORE
IMPORTANT THAN KNOWING WHO THE
INFORMANT MAY BE.
I DON'T KNOW CARTER PAGE OR
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, IF SOME
SOMEBODY FIND A PICTURE I WAS IN
A ROOM WITH GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS,
100 PEOPLE AGAIN I WAS CAMPAIGN
MANAGER FOR WINNING PART OF THE
CAMPAIGN.
I SAW CARTER PAGE ON A DIFFERENT
NETWORK TELL THE ANCHOR I NEVER
MET KELLYANNE CONWAY.
I DON'T KNOW THESE TWO PEOPLE.
LOOKS LIKE THEY HAD SOME VERY
TANGENTIALAL INVOLVEMENT WITH
THE CAMPAIGN EARLIER ON.
MAYBE THIS HAPPENED THEN BUT I
THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO
NOTE WHICH IS, WHEN THE CAMPAIGN
TEAM AND STRUCTURE CHANGED AND
EXPANDED IN AUGUST, DUE TO THE
PRESIDENT MAKING HIS OWN
DECISIONS THEN, I MEAN THE
PRESIDENT OFFERED ME THE
CAMPAIGN MANAGER JOB, TWO OF US
TOGETHER, AUGUST 12th IT,
WAS A FRIDAY.
IT WAS ANNOUNCED NEXT WEDNESDAY.
HE HIRED SOMEBODY ELSE IN
BETWEEN THAT.
IF THIS HAPPENED TO HAPPEN
EARLIER ON, IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT PAGE AND PAPADOPOULOS,
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE
THIS WHOLE IDEA WE'RE ALL THERE
TOGETHER, YOU SAW WHAT WE WERE
DOING.
WE WERE OUT EVERY DAY, WE WERE
VERY TRANSPARENT WITH OUR
STRATEGY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS DOING SIX OR
SEVEN BIG SPEECHES A DAY TOWARD
THE END.
YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS.
ABBY: KELLYANNE, GET YOUR
THOUGHTS ON NORTH KOREA.
YOU WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT
THAT.
RECENT NEWS OUT NORTH KOREA
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT NOT
COMING TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE
BECAUSE OF JOINT MILITARY
EXERCISE WITH SOUTH KOREA.
WHAT WOULD CAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP
TO ULTIMATELY WALK AWAY FROM
THIS THING?
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT VERY
CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING, ABBY,
AND HASN'T CHANGED, IF THE
CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT, SO FAR
THEY WERE LOOKING GOOD FOR A
WHILE, RELEASE OF THREE
DETAINEES, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT
GLOSS OVER AS CHECK THE BOX
EVENT, THAT WAS AMAZINGLY
TRANSFORMATIVE EVENT, MANY
FRUITS ALREADY OCCURRED OVER THE
PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, BUT THE
PRESIDENT SAID HE CAN EASILY
WALK AWAY ALSO.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
IT IS NOT JUST UP TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
HE IS READY TO GO ON
JUNE 12th.
IT IS UP TO NORTH KOREA AND I
SUPPOSE SOUTH KOREA WHAT YOU'RE
DOING TOGETHER.
I SAW THIS MORNING NORTH KOREA
PUT OUT A STATEMENT, THEY HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH SOUTH KOREA'S
LEADERSHIP.
WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT.
AND THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW VERY
MUCH LIKES THE FACT THAT BASED
ON HIS LEADERSHIP THAT AND HIS
TEAM, INCLUDING SECRETARY OF
STATE POMPEO GOING OVER THERE
TWO TIMES, THAT NORTH KOREA HAS
ALREADY SUSPENDED SOME OF THEIR
EXERCISES.
BUT THIS PRESIDENT MADE VERY
CLEAR, DENUCLEARIZING THE KOREAN
PENINSULA IS IN EVERYBODY'S BEST
INTERESTS.
BRIAN: KELLYANNE, I UNDERSTAND
THEY HAVE NOT REACHED FORMALLY
OUT TO YOU GUYS.
NORTH KOREA HAS NOT FORMALLY
REACHED OUT, REGISTERED ANY
COMPLAINTS ABOUT JOHN BOLTON'S
WORDS OR ABOUT MILITARY
EXERCISES.
ALL THIS HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH
THE MEDIA.
IS THAT CORRECT?
>> WELL I SAY THIS ABOUT THAT
SINCE I WILL NOT CONFIRM OR DENY
THAT.
I WILL TELL YOU THIS SO MUCH IS
LITIGATED IN MEDIA AND GETS
REPEATED AND RETWEETED WITHOUT
VERIFICATION.
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT FAKE NEWS.
I REFER TO IT UNINFORMED
CONJECTURE, SPECULATION.
IT IS DANGEROUS, BECAUSE PEOPLE
THINK SPECULATIVE OPINION,
WISHFUL THINKING, CONCLUSIONS IN
SEARCH OF EVIDENCE SOMEHOW RISE
TO THE LEVEL OF FACTS.
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT
FACTS.
THEY SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT
THAT.
LITIGATING TO THE MEDIA, TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT AS,
SENSITIVE AS POSSIBLE SUMMIT
BETWEEN NORTH KOREA, SOUTH
KOREA, THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA BUT THAT IS CONJECTURE.
LOOK, WHAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON HAS
SAID, WHAT SARAH SANDERS HAS
SAID, WE'RE MONITORING THE
SITUATION BUT WE WANT TO VERIFY
WHAT IS FACT AND WHAT IS FICTION
BEFORE WE RUN OUT TO STATE THAT.
I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THE
PRESIDENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY
TEAM IF THERE IS ANNOUNCEMENT TO
BE MADE.
ABBY: YOU SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK
THERE WOULD BE CHANGES IN THE
WHITE HOUSE REGARDING THE LEAKS
CHALLENGES YOU FACED.
WHAT IS THE LATEST, UPDATE ON
THE LEAKING COMING FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE?
>> PEOPLE LOOKING LAST WEEK WERE
CLEARLY DOING THAT TO HURT THE
PEOPLE THE TARGETS OF THOSE
LEAKS.
THERE IS 99.8% OF THE
INFORMATION WE KNOW, SOME OF US
KNOW IN THIS PLACE THAT NEVER
GETS LEAKED OF THE THERE WERE
BIG LEAKS COMING OUT OF THIS
WHITE HOUSE THE FRUIT OF THE
LEAKS WOULD BE IN THE NEWSPAPER,
NOT PROCESS OF THE LEAKS.
ABBY: DO YOU KNOW HOT LEAKERS
ARE, KELLYANNE?
>> SOMEWHAT.
THEY'RE NOT ALL IN THE PRESS AND
COME SHOP AND NOT ALL JUNIOR
FOLKS.
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
WORK ON THIS COMPLEX.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO
THE SENSITIVE INFORMATION.
OTHER NON-SENSITIVE,
NON-CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
STEVE: KELLYANNE, SOME OF THE
LEAKS ARE AUTHORIZED.
THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO GET
WORD OUT, FLOAT A TRIAL BALLOON
BUT UNAUTHORIZED ONES THAT AS
YOU SAID TRYING TO DESTROY
SOMEBODY, THOSE ARE THE
TROUBLESOME ONES FOR YOU.
>> SMALLER, TIGHTER MEETINGS ARE
BETTER IDEA.
TELLING PEOPLE ON NEED TO KNOW
BASIS.
THOSE OF US WHO ARE THE PUBLIC
FACES ON BEHALF OF THIS
ADMINISTRATION, MOST OF WHAT WE
ARE, WHAT WE KNOW AND CAN BE
MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WE DO.
THAT IS THE POINT OF ME STANDING
HERE.
STEVE: SURE.
>> THAT IS SO MUCH MOST OF WHAT
GOES ON HERE WHAT IS KNOWN TO US
IS NOT KNOWN TO PEOPLE ON THE
OUTSIDE AND I THINK THAT IS
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE
ALSO.
THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT DID
NOT LEAK.
THE FIRST LADY'S PROCEDURE
EARLIER THIS WEEK.
THANK GOD SHE'S FINE.
MR. POMPEO GOING TO NORTH KOREA
OVER EASTER.
THE GUESTS, THE FIRST LADY'S
GUESTS AT STATE OF THE UNION.
THERE WERE MANY NEVER LEAKED.
EIGHT OR 10 OF US KNEW THAT.
THERE ARE AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO
LOOK AT THE ABSENCE OF HARMFUL
LEAKS BUT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE
WHO NOBODY KNOWS WHO THEY ARE
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT, THEY'RE
NOT HOUSEHOLD NAMES PERHAPS,
THEY'RE NOT PUBLIC FACES IN THE
ADMINISTRATION.
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION
ALSO.
I THINK, BUT TAKING A BROADER
LOOK AT THAT ALSO BUT THE
PRESIDENT ALSO WANTS ME TO MAKE
VERY CLEAR TO ALL OF YOU, THAT
HE KNOWS A LOT OF THIS IS MADE
UP ALSO.
THAT SPEAKING OF, IF YOU'RE
GOING TO SPECULATE AND BLOVIATE
ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND WHAT MAY
OR MAY NOT BE TRUE YOU ARE
CERTAINLY GOING TO SPECULATE
ABOUT LEAKS.
BUT LET ME MAKE VERY CLEAR, MOST
OF THE STORIES THIS WEEK WERE
ABOUT THE PROCESS OF LEAKS, NOT
THE FRUITS OF THOSE LEAKS.
THERE ARE TIGHTER, SMALLER
MEETINGS.
THAT IS VERY HELPFUL TO THIS
