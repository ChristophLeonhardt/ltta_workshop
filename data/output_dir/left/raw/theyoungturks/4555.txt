1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,660
DONALD TRUMP, JR.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,521
HAS
BASICALLY ADMITTED THAT HE DID

3
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:07,759
TAKE A MEETING WITH A LAWYER
CONNECTED TO THE RUSSIAN

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,920
GOVERNMENT, AND HE DID IT FOR
THE PURPOSE OF TRYING TO GET

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,760
DIRT AND OPPOSITION RESEARCH ON
HILLARY CLINTON.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,780
NOW, IS THAT

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,770
ILLEGAL?

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,080
SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT
JUST ILLEGAL, BUT POTENTIALLY

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,039
TREASONOUS.

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,260
FIRST WE GO TO ONE
OF THE MOST ESTEEMED LAW

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,599
PROFESSORS IN THE COUNTRY,
LAURENCE TRIBE.

12
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:27,599
HE SAYS --

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:45,460
>>BECAUSE ONE OF THE VERY POOR
DEFENSES DONALD TRUMP, JR.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,460
PUT

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,940
FORWARD IS, IT TURNS OUT SHE
DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION I

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,140
WAS LOOKING FOR.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,820
NOW LEGAL
EXPERTS ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY TO

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,040
DONALD TRUMP, JR., BELATEDLY,
THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CONSPIRACY

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,420
TO GET THAT INFORMATION EVEN IF
YOU DIDN'T GET IT.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,420
THAT IS STILL

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,420
A CRIME.

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,720
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU AND
SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE DECIDE YOU

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,040
WILL ROB A BANK, YOU MADE A
PLAN, AND TOOK ACTION TO RUB

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,390
THAT BANK, BUT YOU FOUND OUT THE
BANK WAS CLOSED THAT DAY AND

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,420
WENT BACK HOME, YOU'VE ACTUALLY
ALREADY COMMITTED A CRIME.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,420
IN

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,520
THIS CASE HE IS LIKE, I WENT TO
GO GET STOLEN GOODS BUT SHE

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
DIDN'T HAVE THEM.

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,160
HOW UNLUCKY
OF ME.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,730
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

31
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,700
RICHARD PAINTER, FORMER
ETHICS LAWYER FOR GEORGE W.

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,490
BUSH, SAYS --

33
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:48,229
>>RICHARD PAINTER ISN'T GOING
TO STOP THERE, HE'S COMING WITH

34
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,229
A 2x4.

35
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,229
HERE HE IS ON TV.

36
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:54,180
>>DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND JARED
KUSHNER WERE APPARENTLY BOTH

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,040
INVOLVED IN THIS, THIS WAS AN
EFFORT TO GET OPPOSITION

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,940
RESEARCH ON AN OPPONENT IN AN
AMERICAN POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FROM

39
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,580
THE RUSSIANS, WHO WERE KNOWN TO
BE ENGAGED IN SPYING INSIDE THE

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,620
UNITED STATES.

41
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,090
WE DON'T GET
OPPOSITION RESEARCH FROM SPIES,

42
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,480
WE DON'T COLLABORATE WITH
RUSSIAN SPIES, UNLESS WE WANT TO

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,320
BE ACCUSED OF TREASON.

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,920
I WORKED
FOR TWO AND HALF YEARS OF THE

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,660
CHIEF ETHICS LAWYER OF THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, THEY NEVER WOULD

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,950
HAVE TOLERATED THIS AND IF THE
STORY WAS TRUE WE WOULD HAVE ONE

47
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,530
OF THEM IF NOT BOTH OF THEM IN
CUSTODY BY NOW, THIS IS

48
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,070
UNACCEPTABLE, IT BORDERS ON
TREASON IF IT ISN'T IT SELF

49
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,720
TREASON, DEPENDING ON WHETHER
THE NEW YORK TIMES STORY IS

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
TRUE.

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,660
>>THAT'S A FORMER BUSH OFFICIAL,
HE'S BEEN TOUGH ON THE TRUMP

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,890
ADMINISTRATION THROUGHOUT, BUT
THOSE ARE ABOUT AS TOUGH A

53
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,890
WORDS AS YOU CAN FIND.

54
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,650
BUT HE IS
NOT ALONE.

55
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,740
>>WE HAVE POTENTIAL FOR ACTUAL
TREASON.

56
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,970
WE'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP,

57
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,130
JR., THE MINI-ME TO THE
PRESIDENT, MEETING WITH RUSSIAN

58
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,800
OPERATIVE THINKING HE WILL GET
INFORMATION ON THE HILLARY

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,700
WHERE DO YOU
THINK THAT WAS COMING FROM?

61
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,830
IF THIS WAS A RUSSIAN OPERATION,
IT WAS SOMETHING COMING

62
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,930
THROUGH SPYING.

63
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,620
SO THERE IS PLENTY

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,780
OF SMOKE HERE, AND I THINK WE
ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THE FIRE.

65
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,670
>>NOW, I WILL USE AN ANALOGY
THAT SOME WILL CONSIDER

66
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,239
INFLAMMATORY, BUT IT'S
AN ANALOGY, IT DOESN'T MEAN HE

67
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,480
DID THIS.

68
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:36,209
IF TRUMP, OR ANYONE,
HAD GONE TO ANOTHER ADVERSARY OF

69
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,050
OURS WHO THEY THOUGHT WAS SPYING
ON THEIR OPPONENTS AND GOTTEN

70
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,239
INFORMATION, IT WOULD BE
PROBLEMATIC.

71
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,660
IF I SAY THE

72
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,660
CANADIANS, YOU MIGHT SAY THEY
ARE OUR ALLIES SO IT'S NOT SO

73
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,100
BAD, THE ANSWER WOULD BE AS IT
IS.

74
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,879
IF I SAY THE CHINESE, YOU

75
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,709
SAY I GET IT, THE CHINESE MIGHT
WANT TO STEAL INFORMATION ABOUT

76
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,340
HILLARY CLINTON OR MAYBE TRUMP
DEPENDING ON WHO THEY ARE

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,629
SUPPORTING, THAT WOULD BE BAD TO
WORK WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

78
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:03,629
LIKE THAT.

79
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,709
WHAT IF I SAID
ANOTHER ADVERSARY, LIKE AL

80
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,569
QAEDA?

81
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,480
IMAGINE IF AL QAEDA HAD
INFORMATION THEY HAD STOLEN

82
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,559
SOMEHOW FROM ONE OF THE PEOPLE
RUNNING IN THE RACE, AND THEY

83
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:19,639
OFFERED IT TO THE OTHER, AND THE
OTHER CAMP WAS LIKE, SURE.

84
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,639
I'LL

85
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,840
TAKE A MEETING WITH THEM AND SEE
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION THEY

86
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,539
STOLE ON MY OPPONENTS, AND SEE
IF I CAN USE IT IN THE ELECTION.

87
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,590
PEOPLE WOULD BE PISSED.

88
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,520
I'M NOT
SAYING RUSSIA IS THE SAME AS AL

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,900
QAEDA, AND GIVING YOU A RANGE
FROM CANADA TO AL QAEDA TO GIVE

90
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,660
YOU A SENSE THAT THIS IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU DO.

91
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
YOU DON'T TRY

92
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,300
TO GET STOLEN INFORMATION
CERTAINLY FROM ADVERSARIES, OR

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,689
EVEN FROM ALLIES, FROM A FOREIGN
COUNTRY TO USE AGAINST YOUR

94
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:46,689
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

95
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:49,499
YES, THAT
IS IN FACT ILLEGAL.

96
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:50,499
AND THERE'S

97
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,800
ONE LAST INTERESTING THEORY,
IT'S FROM A FORMER CIA

98
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,960
OPERATIVE, AND SHE IS BASICALLY
SAYING, YOU KNOW, THEY MIGHT

99
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,889
HAVE DONE THIS, THE KREMLIN
MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS, JUST TO

100
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,259
GET THESE IDIOTS TO SHOW UP, AND
IF THEY DO THEN THEY HAVE

101
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,619
SOMETHING ON THEM.

102
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:10,930
EVEN IF THERE
IS NO INFORMATION TO GIVE THEM,

103
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,210
THE RUSSIANS KNOW THAT YOU
SHOWING UP TO THIS MEETING IS IN

104
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,789
AND OF ITSELF ILLEGAL, THEN THEY
HAVE THE GOODS ON YOU.

105
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:17,789
IF THEY

106
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,159
WANTED TO USE THAT AGAINST YOU
MAYBE THEY COULD.

107
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:20,159
LET ME HAVE

108
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,159
HER EXPLAIN, SHE SAYS --

109
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:31,879
>>THEN SHE WENT ON TO TALK
ABOUT JARED KUSHNER'S ROLE, HE

110
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,849
DID NOT DISCLOSE THIS MEETING,
HE WAS IN THE MEETING ALONG WITH

111
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:37,889
DONALD TRUMP, JR.
AND PAUL MANAFORT.

112
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,219
SINCE HE DIDN'T PUT IT IN HIS
BACKGROUND CHECK, SHE

113
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:42,379
EXPLAINS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE
THIS BEFORE --

114
00:05:42,379 --> 00:06:01,740
>>UH OH.

115
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:12,550
SO, NOW DONALD TRUMP,
JR.

116
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,409
HAS LAWYERED UP AND ISN'T

117
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,089
ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
ANYMORE.

118
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,559
HIS EFFORT TO GET AN

119
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,309
ATTORNEY APPARENTLY WAS A DAY
TOO LATE BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY

120
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:25,491
ADMITTED HE WAS IN FACT LOOKING
FOR OPPOSITION RESEARCH, HE DID

121
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:29,360
GO TO THAT MEETING, HE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT, AND HIS

122
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,020
EXCUSE OF, I DIDN'T WIND UP
GETTING THE STOLEN GOODS, IS NOT

123
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,249
A GOOD LEGAL EXCUSE.

124
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:37,150
WHAT IS
THAT I HEAR?

125
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,889
LOCK HIM UP!

126
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:39,889
LOCK

127
00:06:39,889 --> 00:00:00,000
HIM UP!
