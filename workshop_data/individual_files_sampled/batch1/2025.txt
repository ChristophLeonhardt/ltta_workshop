I think Trump being elected president Trump running for president maybe one of the best things that's ever happened for feminist and feminism I was talking to my daughter the other day who was who was upset about this and I said there look it's on the table it's there we we know these Billy Bush conversations are taking place let's deal with it and recognize too that this sense of we have this momentum in feminism and away we go is actually a false false view we're not adding substantially to women who are CEOs of big companies that stalled out gender diversity in my old industry the financial services industry Wall Street stalled out in fact going backwards over some period of time so let's just make sure we understand the facts rather than operate in a world in which we feel like hey where everything's great but it's all below the surface where I also feel optimistic is that things are different than they were 10 15 20 years ago women have more choices women have more options 15 years ago you could have started your own business 20 years ago leaving a company to have a non-traditional career path of freelancing in part time wasn't available either we have more options I think we might look back at this period a handful of years from now and say that was actually a watershed and positive moment for feminism and the advancement of women we hope we hope you know we hope
