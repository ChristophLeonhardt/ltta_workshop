I always kind of looked at them
as not necessarily pride
in what they represented but
just, like that's part of my
city. That’s kind of
part of who we are.
But part of New Orleans is also
that it changes, you know
like every city so—
I think this is kind of a step
in the right direction.
You don’t put a swastika
up by mistake.
You don’t put a rebel flag
up by mistake.
There are direct
intentions behind that,
rooted in very old traditions
and very old history
that always allocates itself back to
the enslavement of my ancestors.
I’m here to defend my heritage.
These are my ancestors.
When you try to explain to them about it,
all they want to spout out to you
is that you’re a racist.
It extends beyond racism.
A lot of these people even on
the other side of those
barricades, they want things
to stay the same.
Do we want to have
monuments tell our history?
We either need to reinterpret
them somehow,
or acknowledge that that story
is going to be told by the
people who created those
monuments.
