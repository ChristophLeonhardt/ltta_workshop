at sunset the views from the European Southern Observatory located and Chile's Atacama Desert are breathtaking but it's at night when the deep darkness and unique atmospheric conditions of the atacama turned these skies into heaven for astronomers but at the Paranal Observatory scientists probed the universe with giant telescopes but at 2600 metres above sea level and a hundred and fifty kilometers from the city of antofagasta these starlit skies are being threatened by light pollution we are in very isolated place in inside Chile but we can see still hollows from the cities from the mines so it's a it's very it's very disturbing to see all of these lights from space you can see just how contaminated by light our planet is becoming making it more difficult to see the stars although Chile's government has introduced standards to significantly reduce street lighting in cities near observatories cheap white LED lights are increasingly illuminating homes store signs and billboards especially in the cities of la serena and coke in Belen but the impact is growing it's well known and measurable so it's no longer a threat it's a reality it's happening at a time when astronomers like Fernando Salman believe they've never been closer to making the discovery of all time the greatest adventure of humanity right now is happening here which is that we are looking for life in the universe and that is happening right now here in the Atacama Desert and for that darkness is crucial this exotic structure may look familiar it was used as the location for the lair of the forces of evil in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace but in fact the reason why it is practically underground is to keep light from leaking out at night from this pattern as residents of some 150 astronomers and technicians northern Chile will house 70% of global astronomical infrastructure in less than five years along with the world's largest telescope but astronomers are sending out an SOS warning that if mankind continues to over illuminate the skies we will lose the time long ability to gaze and be guided by the Stars
