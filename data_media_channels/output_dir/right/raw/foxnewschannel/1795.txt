1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,575
STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

2
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:11,112
MY NEXT GUEST TRAVELED OVER

3
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,380
27,000 MILES, INTERVIEWED TRUMP

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,249
VOTERS IN TEN SWING COUNTIES TO

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:17,185
DISCOVER WHAT WAS BEHIND THE

6
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:17,953
HISTORIC 2016 ELECTION.

7
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:20,555
JOINING ME NOW, THE COAUTHORS OF

8
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:24,025
"THE GREAT REVOLT, RESHAPING

9
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,794
AMERICA POLITICS."

10
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:28,396
GOOD TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.

11
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,998
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND

12
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:31,733
THANK YOU FOR THE BOOK.

13
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,568
AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR

14
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:33,902
DEBATE.

15
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:35,704
WHAT DID YOU MAINLY LEARN?

16
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:37,806
>> WELL, ONE OF THE MOST

17
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:39,474
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I LEARNED

18
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:42,043
IS THAT THIS IS A VERY

19
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,112
ASPIRATIONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE.

20
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:45,947
AND THEIR INFLUENCE IN OUR

21
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,250
COUNTRY GO WELL BEYOND THE

22
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,351
BALLOT BOX.

23
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,821
SO YOU AREN'T JUST FEELING THE

24
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,689
PRESSURE FROM THEM IN WHO PEOPLE

25
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,425
VOTED FOR IN THE ELECTION IN

26
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,995
2016, BUT ALSO YOU SEE

27
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,763
INFLUENCES IN COMMERCE, IN HOW

28
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:03,398
WE SPEND OUR MONEY AND HOW WE

29
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:05,500
WATCH TELEVISION AND HOW WE VIEW

30
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,569
THINGS LIKE SPORTS.

31
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,672
AND THEY'RE A CULTURE AND A

32
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:12,941
COALITION THAT IS DEMANDING

33
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:16,144
RESPECT FROM THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE

34
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:19,014
OF MAIN STREET WHERE THEY LIVE.

35
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:20,949
AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

36
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,450
THINGS IS, THIS IS A COALITION

37
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,486
AND A MOVEMENT THAT IS STILL --

38
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:26,087
WE'RE STILL NOT HEARING WHAT IT

39
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:26,888
HAS TO SAY.

40
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:28,823
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS AN

41
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,425
IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER WHEN

42
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:33,628
WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD, NOT JUST IN

43
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:36,298
POLITICS, BUT IN EVERYTHING IN

44
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:38,199
OUR SOCIETY.

45
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,301
STEVE: BRAD, I JUST WANTED TO

46
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:41,069
ASK YOU WHETHER, WHAT YOU MAKE

47
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,871
OF THE ARGUMENTS WE'VE BEEN

48
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,739
HEARING LATELY THAT ACTUALLY

49
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,475
DESPITE WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

50
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,144
ASSUME, THE TRUMP VOTE AND THIS

51
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:54,482
MOVEMENT WAS DRIVEN, THIS POP

52
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,251
POPULOUS MOVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY

53
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,053
THE ECONOMIC, THAT ACTUALLY IT'S

54
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,889
A LOT ABOUT CULTURE AND WHITE

55
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,090
MEN NOT LIKING THE FACT THAT

56
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,659
WOMEN HAVE JOBS AND MINORITIES

57
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,228
ARE GETTING THEIR SWAY IN THE

58
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:07,562
CULTURE.

59
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:10,365
WE'VE SEEN THAT CRITIQUE LATE

60
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:12,701
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

61
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:15,470
>> THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE

62
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,504
ELITES ON THE COAST AND THE

63
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,939
ELITES IN THE MEDIA NOT GETTING

64
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:18,206
IT.

65
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:19,874
THEY DIDN'T GET THE OUTCOME THEY

66
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,109
EXPECTED, DIDN'T GET THE OUTCOME

67
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:22,811
THEY WANTED, SO THEY HAVE TO

68
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,245
ATTACK THE CHARACTER AND THE

69
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,347
MOTIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO

70
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:27,482
DELIVER THE OUTCOME.

71
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,817
DONALD TRUMP WAS THE CAUSE OF

72
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,352
THIS, HE WAS THE RESULT OF IT.

73
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,287
IT WAS A MOVEMENT THAT HAS BEEN

74
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:35,457
COMING FOR A LONG TIME AND A

75
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:37,058
POPULOUS MOVEMENT IMPACTING

76
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:37,559
OTHER INDUSTRIES.

77
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:43,465
WE DON'T HAVE SEARS AND ROE RO B

78
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:43,498
WE DON'T HAVE SEARS AND ROE RO C

79
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:43,965
WE DON'T HAVE SEARS AND ROE RO ,

80
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:45,500
WE GO TO AMAZON.

81
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,602
THAT'S THE CORE OF WHAT THIS

82
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:48,837
MOVEMENT WAS.

83
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:49,838
STEVE: YOU SAID THERE'S MORE TO

84
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,172
COME FROM THIS MOVEMENT.

85
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,441
EXPLAIN THAT IS AIT

86
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:53,942
EXPLAIN THAT AS AIT

87
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:53,975
EXPLAIN THAT A BAIT

88
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:54,009
EXPLAIN THAT A BITT

89
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:54,476
EXPLAIN THAT A BIT.

90
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:57,012
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT IN ?

91
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:59,581
>> I THINK THIS COALITION STAYS

92
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:00,782
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE.

93
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,917
BUT AS WE WERE BOTH SAYING, THE

94
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,253
IMPACT IS OUTSIDE OF THE BALLOT

95
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:05,653
BOX, TOO.

96
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:09,424
LOOK AT THE RATINGS IN THE NFL,

97
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:13,294
THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN

98
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:13,728
DRAMATICALLY.

99
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:15,397
THEY USED TO HAVE THE BEST

100
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:16,664
BRANDS IN THE COUNTRY.

101
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:19,667
NOW THAT BRAND IS WEAKENED.

102
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,037
LOOK AT "ROSE ANNE."

103
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:25,073
NO ONE IN HOLLYWOOD WOULD HAVE

104
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:26,374
PREDICTED THAT THAT WAS GOING TO

105
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:26,941
HAPPEN.

106
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,444
LOOK AT WHO DROVE THOSE NUMBERS.

107
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:31,079
IT WASN'T THE NEW YORK MEDIA

108
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,248
MARKET OR THE LOS ANGELES MEDIA

109
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,648
MARKET.

110
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:36,818
IT WAS TULSA, OKLAHOMA,

111
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:39,120
CINCINNATI, OHIO, PIRTS PURRING,

112
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,554
PENNSYLVANIA.

113
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:40,388
NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES DON'T

114
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,323
EVEN MAKE THE TOP 20.

115
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:46,461
THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THESE PEOPLE

116
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:48,129
HAVE MORE POWER IN COMMERCE THAN

117
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,565
I THINK THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

118
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:51,166
STEVE: THAT'S REALLY

119
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:51,966
INTERESTING.

120
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,069
BRAD, SELENA, THANKS SO MUCH.

121
00:03:54,069 --> 00:00:00,000
I HOPE WE CAN KEEP TALKING ABOUT
