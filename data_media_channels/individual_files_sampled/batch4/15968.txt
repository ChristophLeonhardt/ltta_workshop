Ted Cruz pretty smart guy and he beats pretty much anybody when it comes to constitutional knowledge he is brilliant definitely one of the smartest guys vying for the nomination for presidency back in 2016 I also think that he would make an exceptional Supreme Court justice so maybe hopefully at some point he will get that shot but this time he put his best Larry Bird skills to the test on the hardwood and a one-on-one battle against late-night TV host who cries on practically every show blabbering on about how the big bad mean monster Republicans are going to kill his son because they're stripping the chip program he spews lies on the rag it's kind of his shtick he always forgets to mention the fact that it's actually Republicans who protected the chip program and after passing their bill on from the house Democrats have repeatedly opposed it I think four times to be exact but this time I'm not faulting him for being the blatant unapologetic ignorant liar that he is I'm faulting him for writing a check he couldn't cash it all started on Twitter as anything worth mentioning does when he called Ted Cruz a blobfish yes a blobfish is that a fragglerock character he also questioned Ted Cruz's intellect but I don't think there's any question on who would win that duel anyway Cruz who happened to be Manning his own Twitter at that moment decided to engage with Jimmy and challenged him to a one-on-one basketball game the event happened this past weekend and took place before a surprisingly large crowd at Texas Christian universities arena while both men were pretty slow and sloppy on the court compared to the NBA players that we were used to seeing trade baskets on TV Ted Cruz beat Jimmy Kimmel 11 to 9 so I guess you could say Jimmy Kimmel was cruisin for a bruisin corny corny corny I'm sorry that was a dad joke speaking of happy belated Father's Day to all of you wonderful fathers out there out there anyway the blobfish basketball classic as it was titled was all for a good cause finally a little bit of unity and teaming up for a good purpose initially both men agreed that the loser would donate $5,000 to the winners choice of charity but in the end both men donating $10,000 to the charity so good cause clean game a little bit of firmly friendly camaraderie in the name of politics and showbiz so maybe we should keep this going one politician and one celebrity Duke it out every year at the end of the NBA Finals to be honest I would be more likely to watch this then I would the NBA Finals because I don't really watch people but I would watch this thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda headboard the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at wwww do forward slash OHS make sure you're following us on Facebook and Twitter for all of our latest news and download our new app for the rebel media on the App Store that way you will have instant and easy access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda headboard the rebel
