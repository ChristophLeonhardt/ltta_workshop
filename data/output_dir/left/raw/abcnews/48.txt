OF THE UNION.

52
02:00:57,950 --> 02:00:59,318
WHAT A YEAR IT HAS BEEN.

53
02:00:59,318 --> 02:01:01,687
IT'S BEEN A YEAR OF CONFLICT AND

54
02:01:01,687 --> 02:01:01,987
CONTROVERSY.

55
02:01:01,987 --> 02:01:03,456
BOTH FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE

56
02:01:03,456 --> 02:01:05,024
COUNTRY HE NOW LEADS.

57
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,759
IT'S BEEN EXCITING AND 

58
02:01:06,759 --> 02:01:08,928
EXHAUSTING, UNUSUAL IN SO MANY 

59
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:09,128
WAYS.

60
02:01:09,128 --> 02:01:10,963
WITH A PRESIDENT UNLIKE ANY 

61
02:01:10,963 --> 02:01:12,131
WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.

62
02:01:12,131 --> 02:01:13,699
TONIGHT, A TURN TO TRADITION.

63
02:01:13,699 --> 02:01:14,800
TRUMP'S CHANCE TO PUT HIS STAMP 

64
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,702
ON THE YEAR PAST AND SET THE 

65
02:01:16,702 --> 02:01:18,203
AGENDA FOR THE YEAR AHEAD IN 

66
02:01:18,203 --> 02:01:21,340
THIS MOST FORMAL SETTING.

67
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,875
AND THAT WAS THE MOMENT, JUST 

68
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:24,810
MOMENTS AGO WHEN THE FIRST LADY,

69
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:26,812
MELANIA TRUMP, CAME IN, AS HAS 

70
02:01:26,812 --> 02:01:28,447
BECOME THE TRADITION.

71
02:01:28,447 --> 02:01:30,049
SHE'LL BE SURROUNDED BY THE 

72
02:01:30,049 --> 02:01:31,350
PRESIDENT'S GUESTS TODAY.

73
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:32,551
AND WE'RE SURROUNDED BY OUR 

74
02:01:32,551 --> 02:01:33,285
POLITICAL TEAM TONIGHT.

75
02:01:33,285 --> 02:01:37,890
I WANT TO GO TO OUR JON KARL IN 

76
02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:38,524
THE CHAMBERS.

77
02:01:38,524 --> 02:01:39,558
AND THE PRESIDENT CLEARLY GOING 

78
02:01:39,558 --> 02:01:40,926
TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP TONIGHT, 

79
02:01:40,926 --> 02:01:41,894
TAKE CREDIT FOR THE STRONG 

80
02:01:41,894 --> 02:01:43,295
ECONOMY AND THE TAX CUT HE 

81
02:01:43,295 --> 02:01:44,697
THINKS IS GOING TO MAKE IT 

82
02:01:44,697 --> 02:01:46,165
STRONGER, BUT HE IS ALSO 

83
02:01:46,165 --> 02:01:48,000
ENTERING THE CHAMBER WITH THE 

84
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,772
LOWEST APPROVAL RATING OF ANY 

85
02:01:52,772 --> 02:01:53,839
MODERN PRESIDENT ONE YEAR IN.

86
02:01:53,839 --> 02:01:54,807
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THE 

87
02:01:54,807 --> 02:01:57,409
SPEECH IS GOING TO BE BOTH 

88
02:01:57,409 --> 02:01:58,911
OPTIMISTIC AND INCLUSIVE.

89
02:01:58,911 --> 02:01:59,945
THOSE ARE NOT THE FIRST WORDS 

90
02:01:59,945 --> 02:02:01,113
THAT COME TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK

91
02:02:01,113 --> 02:02:02,348
OF TRUMP'S FIRST YEAR.

92
02:02:02,348 --> 02:02:02,915
>> RIGHT.

93
02:02:02,915 --> 02:02:04,517
THE THEME HE HAS TONIGHT IS 

94
02:02:04,517 --> 02:02:06,485
UNITY, BUT HE'S ENTERING A 

95
02:02:06,485 --> 02:02:10,022
CHAMBER THAT IS AS DIVIDED AS 

96
02:02:10,022 --> 02:02:11,524
HAS EVER BEEN.

97
02:02:11,524 --> 02:02:13,526
I WAS HERE DURING THE CLINTON 

98
02:02:13,526 --> 02:02:15,528
IMPEACHMENT AND THIS FEELS EVEN 

99
02:02:15,528 --> 02:02:17,997
MORE DIVIDED THAN IT WAS THEN.

100
02:02:17,997 --> 02:02:19,398
MANY DEMOCRATS HERE IN THIS 

101
02:02:19,398 --> 02:02:22,368
CHAMBER SEE THE PRESIDENT AS NOT

102
02:02:22,368 --> 02:02:24,103
MERELY SOMEBODY THEY DISAGREE 

103
02:02:24,103 --> 02:02:26,939
WITH, BUT SOMEBODY WHO IS A 

104
02:02:26,939 --> 02:02:27,172
DANGER.

105
02:02:27,172 --> 02:02:28,574
AND REPUBLICANS IN THIS CHAMBER 

106
02:02:28,574 --> 02:02:30,442
TALK ABOUT THIS DEEP STATE 

107
02:02:30,442 --> 02:02:34,280
CONSPIRACY WITHIN THE FBI TO 

108
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:34,747
THWART THIS PRESIDENT.

109
02:02:34,747 --> 02:02:37,116
BUT THE PRESIDENT'S THEME HERE 

110
02:02:37,116 --> 02:02:37,850
WILL BE OPTIMISM.

111
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:39,485
IN THE TRUMP WORLD VIEW, AMERICA

112
02:02:39,485 --> 02:02:39,985
IS BACK.

113
02:02:39,985 --> 02:02:41,287
STOCK MARKET IS ROARING.

114
02:02:41,287 --> 02:02:43,455
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF AN 

115
02:02:43,455 --> 02:02:44,523
HISTORIC RALLY THERE.

116
02:02:44,523 --> 02:02:45,624
UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN.

117
02:02:45,624 --> 02:02:47,193
AND THANKS TO HIS TAX CUTS, 

118
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:48,360
AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE HANDING 

119
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:48,693
OUT BONUSES.

120
02:02:48,693 --> 02:02:50,062
>> THAT REALLY TURNED THE CORNER

121
02:02:50,062 --> 02:02:51,363
FOR THE PRESIDENT AT THE END OF 

122
02:02:51,363 --> 02:02:52,965
THE YEAR.

123
02:02:52,965 --> 02:02:54,333
MARY BRUCE ALSO IN THE HOUSE 

124
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:56,836
TONIGHT, OVER IN STATUTORY HALL.

125
02:02:56,836 --> 02:02:59,104
THAT'S THE BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT 

126
02:02:59,104 --> 02:03:02,107
FOR THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE 

127
02:03:02,107 --> 02:03:02,574
AND SENATE.

128
02:03:02,574 --> 02:03:04,043
THEY GOT THAT SUPREME COURT 

129
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:05,544
JUSTICE, BUT MANY REPUBLICANS 

130
02:03:05,544 --> 02:03:07,179
FEAR THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THIS 

131
02:03:07,179 --> 02:03:08,447
MAJORITY BECAUSE OF THE BACKLASH

132
02:03:08,447 --> 02:03:09,615
AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP.

133
02:03:09,615 --> 02:03:11,817
>> GEORGE, POLLS SHOW THIS 

134
02:03:11,817 --> 02:03:13,051
PRESIDENT IS DEEPLY UNPOPULAR 

135
02:03:13,051 --> 02:03:15,554
AND SO FAR, WE'VE SEEN HIS PARTY

136
02:03:15,554 --> 02:03:17,256
IS PAYING THE POLITICAL PRICE.

137
02:03:17,256 --> 02:03:19,458
THE GOP MAJORITY HERE IS NOW ON 

138
02:03:19,458 --> 02:03:20,593
THE LINE.

139
02:03:20,593 --> 02:03:22,260
AND SO, WHILE THE PRESIDENT 

140
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:23,762
TONIGHT MAY TRY TO STRIKE MORE 

141
02:03:23,762 --> 02:03:27,900
OF AN OPTIMISTIC TONE, A 

142
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:28,867
BIPARTISAN TONE AS HE TRIES TO 

143
02:03:28,867 --> 02:03:30,569
STRIKE DEALS ON EVERYTHING FROM 

144
02:03:30,569 --> 02:03:31,837
IMMIGRATION TO INFRASTRUCTURE TO

145
02:03:31,837 --> 02:03:33,806
A SPENDING DEAL, THE REALITY IS,

146
02:03:33,806 --> 02:03:34,973
HE NEEDS DEMOCRATS NOW IN ORDER 

147
02:03:34,973 --> 02:03:36,208
TO GET ANYTHING DONE, IN ORDER 

148
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:37,676
TO GET HIS AGENDA THROUGH.

149
02:03:37,676 --> 02:03:39,678
BUT GEORGE, DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE 

150
02:03:39,678 --> 02:03:41,113
ALREADY EYEING NOVEMBER AND THEY

151
02:03:41,113 --> 02:03:43,749
HOPE EYEING RETAKING THE 

152
02:03:43,749 --> 02:03:44,016
MAJORITY.

153
02:03:44,016 --> 02:03:44,650
>> AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID 

154
02:03:44,650 --> 02:03:46,819
MANY TIMES, HE NEEDS 60 VOTES TO

155
02:03:46,819 --> 02:03:47,486
GET ANYTHING DONE.

156
02:03:47,486 --> 02:03:49,354
AS YOU SAID, JON KARL, HEALING 

157
02:03:49,354 --> 02:03:50,789
THE DIVIDE GOING TO BE A BIG 

158
02:03:50,789 --> 02:03:51,690
THEME OF THE PRESIDENT.

159
02:03:51,690 --> 02:03:52,858
HERE WITH "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" 

160
02:03:52,858 --> 02:03:53,359
DAVID MUIR.

161
02:03:53,359 --> 02:03:54,593
WE WERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY

162
02:03:54,593 --> 02:03:55,093
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

163
02:03:55,093 --> 02:03:56,495
HE TALKED ABOUT HEALING THIS 

164
02:03:56,495 --> 02:03:56,996
DIVIDE.

165
02:03:56,996 --> 02:03:58,130
ALSO, IT WAS INTERESTING, 

166
02:03:58,130 --> 02:03:59,765
TOWARDS THE END OF THAT LUNCH, 

167
02:03:59,765 --> 02:04:01,533
HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE LEARNED 

168
02:04:01,533 --> 02:04:02,667
AS PRESIDENT THIS YEAR, LEARNED 

169
02:04:02,667 --> 02:04:06,338
HE HAS TO WORK WITH HEART AND 

170
02:04:06,338 --> 02:04:06,538
SOUL.

171
02:04:06,538 --> 02:04:07,072
DIFFERENT FROM BUSINESS.

172
02:04:07,072 --> 02:04:07,439
>> ABSOLUTELY.

173
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:10,075
BECAUSE HE CAMPAIGNED ON BEING A

174
02:04:10,075 --> 02:04:10,375
BUSINESSMAN.

175
02:04:10,375 --> 02:04:11,710
BUT HE SAID A LOT OF THE SKILLS 

176
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:13,212
YOU LEARN AS A BUSINESSMAN, HE'S

177
02:04:13,212 --> 02:04:14,046
BROUGHT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 

178
02:04:14,046 --> 02:04:14,380
HIM.

179
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:15,847
HE SAID YOU REALLY DO WHAT'S 

180
02:04:15,847 --> 02:04:17,249
BEST FOR PURELY MONETARY REASONS

181
02:04:17,249 --> 02:04:18,483
WHEN YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN, YOU 

182
02:04:18,483 --> 02:04:20,052
MAKE YOUR MONEY, YOU'RE 

183
02:04:20,052 --> 02:04:21,687
COMPETING AGAINST PEOPLE YOU 

184
02:04:21,687 --> 02:04:23,355
OFTEN DON'T LIKE, YOU WANT TO 

185
02:04:23,355 --> 02:04:25,124
WIN.

186
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:26,792
BUT HE SAID, IN WHAT IS NORMALLY

187
02:04:26,792 --> 02:04:28,827
AN OFF THE RECORD MOMENT, HE 

188
02:04:28,827 --> 02:04:29,995
SAID, I HAVE LEARNED THAT IT 

189
02:04:29,995 --> 02:04:32,431
TAKES HEART AND COMPASSION TO 

190
02:04:32,431 --> 02:04:32,664
GOVERN.

191
02:04:32,664 --> 02:04:34,066
>> HERE COMES THE

HE WILL INTRODUCE THE PRESIDENT.

194
02:04:37,736 --> 02:04:38,570

THE UNITED STATES.

>> AND THE PRESIDENT WILL WORK 

197
02:04:43,976 --> 02:04:47,146
HIS WAY DOWN THE AISLE.

198
02:04:47,146 --> 02:04:48,981
MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LOOKING

199
02:04:48,981 --> 02:04:49,914
FOR THAT GRIP AND GRIN AS HE 

200
02:04:49,914 --> 02:04:53,752
MAKES HIS WAY DOWN.

201
02:04:53,752 --> 02:04:54,954
MATTHEW DOWD, WE'RE TALKING 

202
02:04:54,954 --> 02:04:56,121
ABOUT THOSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 

203
02:04:56,121 --> 02:04:57,356
LOOKING FOR A SECOND WITH THE 

204
02:04:57,356 --> 02:04:57,623
PRESIDENT.

205
02:04:57,623 --> 02:04:58,890
YOU GOT ABOUT 20 MINUTES WITH 

206
02:04:58,890 --> 02:05:00,459
THE PRESIDENT TODAY ALONE, WHILE

207
02:05:00,459 --> 02:05:02,027
WE WERE, AFTER WE WERE HAVING 

208
02:05:02,027 --> 02:05:04,296
LUNCH, HE CALLED YOU IN FOR A 

209
02:05:04,296 --> 02:05:05,998
MEETING AND REINFORCED THIS 

210
02:05:05,998 --> 02:05:07,132
THEME HERE THAT WE'VE BEEN 

211
02:05:07,132 --> 02:05:07,499
TALKING ABOUT.

212
02:05:07,499 --> 02:05:08,901
>> YEAH, THE WHITE HOUSE REACHED

213
02:05:08,901 --> 02:05:10,602
OUT THIS MORNING AND ASKED IF I 

214
02:05:10,602 --> 02:05:13,005
COULD HAVE A MEETING AT THE OVAL

215
02:05:13,005 --> 02:05:14,539
OFFICE AND IT WAS A ONE-ON-ONE 

216
02:05:14,539 --> 02:05:15,741
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 

217
02:05:15,741 --> 02:05:16,008
I.

218
02:05:16,008 --> 02:05:17,810
AND I EMPHASIZED TO THE 

219
02:05:17,810 --> 02:05:18,944
PRESIDENT, I SAID TO THE 

220
02:05:18,944 --> 02:05:20,512
PRESIDENT, THIS COUNTRY IS AS 

221
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:22,247
DIVIDED AS IT'S EVER BEEN IN OUR

222
02:05:22,247 --> 02:05:23,181
HISTORY AND HE AS THE PRESIDENT 

223
02:05:23,181 --> 02:05:25,217
OF THE UNITED STATES, HE NEEDS 

224
02:05:25,217 --> 02:05:26,352
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

225
02:05:26,352 --> 02:05:28,253
I TOLD HIM, IT'S GOING TO TAKE 

226
02:05:28,253 --> 02:05:30,623
MORE THAN JUST A SPEECH TONIGHT.

227
02:05:30,623 --> 02:05:32,124
HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF 

228
02:05:32,124 --> 02:05:32,625
THE TEACH.

229
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:35,861
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A SERIES OF 

230
02:05:35,861 --> 02:05:37,730
ACTIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS

231
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:37,963
SPEECH.

232
02:05:37,963 --> 02:05:39,231
HE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HOWDY 

233
02:05:39,231 --> 02:05:41,567
SLIDED THE COUNTRY IS AND HE 

234
02:05:41,567 --> 02:05:42,067
NEEDS TO STEP UP.

235
02:05:42,067 --> 02:05:47,172
>> AND CECILIA VEGA, ONE OF THE 

236
02:05:47,172 --> 02:05:48,507
ISSUES GOING TO BE FRONT AND 

237
02:05:48,507 --> 02:05:49,808
CENTER TONIGHT, IMMIGRATION.

238
02:05:49,808 --> 02:05:51,610
IT'S DIVIDED DEMOCRATS AND 

239
02:05:51,610 --> 02:05:52,444
REPUBLICANS, DIFFERENT REGIONS 

240
02:05:52,444 --> 02:05:52,844
OF THE COUNTRY.

241
02:05:52,844 --> 02:05:55,180
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEMED TO 

242
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:57,950
BE OF A DIVIDED MIND ON THIS, AS

243
02:05:57,950 --> 02:05:58,150
WELL.

244
02:05:58,150 --> 02:05:59,518
SOMETIMES TALKING ABOUT 

245
02:05:59,518 --> 02:06:00,352
COMPROMISE, TAKING QUITE A HARD 

246
02:06:00,352 --> 02:06:01,253
LINE ON IMMIGRATION.

247
02:06:01,253 --> 02:06:03,922
>> AND THAT'S BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY

248
02:06:03,922 --> 02:06:06,058
FRUSTRATING FOR THE PEOPLE 

249
02:06:06,058 --> 02:06:07,026
TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL WITH 

250
02:06:07,026 --> 02:06:08,861
HIM.

251
02:06:08,861 --> 02:06:10,696
REMEMBER, CHUCK SCHUMER SAID 

252
02:06:10,696 --> 02:06:11,530
NEGOTIATING WITH DONALD TRUMP 

253
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:13,132
HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH 

254
02:06:13,132 --> 02:06:13,432
JELL-O.

255
02:06:13,432 --> 02:06:16,769
THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON THIS 

256
02:06:16,769 --> 02:06:17,670
CONGRESS AND THIS PRESIDENT TO 

257
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:18,837
SAVE THESE DREAMERS, AS MANY 

258
02:06:18,837 --> 02:06:19,271
WOULD SAY.

259
02:06:19,271 --> 02:06:21,006
HE NEEDS THE DEMOCRATS TO DO 

260
02:06:21,006 --> 02:06:21,206
THIS.

261
02:06:21,206 --> 02:06:22,173
WE ARE TOLD THAT IMMIGRATION 

262
02:06:22,173 --> 02:06:23,842
WILL BE A BIG FOCUS TONIGHT.

263
02:06:23,842 --> 02:06:25,911
WE ALSO KNOW THAT AMONG THE MAIN

264
02:06:25,911 --> 02:06:26,911
SPEECHWRITERS WHO HELPED THE 

265
02:06:26,911 --> 02:06:27,813
PRESIDENT ON THIS SPEECH IS 

266
02:06:27,813 --> 02:06:29,514
STEPHEN MILLER, HIS SENIOR 

267
02:06:29,514 --> 02:06:31,250
ADVISER WHO HELPED WRITE THIS 

268
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:31,483
SPEECH.

269
02:06:31,483 --> 02:06:33,118
YOU KNOW, IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN A

270
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:34,553
REAL TEST FOR THIS PRESIDENT.

271
02:06:34,553 --> 02:06:35,987
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT, THE ART 

272
02:06:35,987 --> 02:06:37,890
OF THE DEAL PRESIDENT WHO SO FAR

273
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:40,158
HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REACH A DEAL 

274
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:41,994
ON IMMIGRATION, HIS BIG SELLING 

275
02:06:41,994 --> 02:06:43,862
POINT, THE WALL, STILL NOT 

276
02:06:43,862 --> 02:06:44,095
FUNDED.

277
02:06:44,095 --> 02:06:45,631
PUSHING FOR THAT DEAL, GEORGE.

278
02:06:45,631 --> 02:06:48,801
>> IT'S BEDEVILLED PRESIDENTS 

279
02:06:48,801 --> 02:06:49,568
BEFORE.

280
02:06:49,568 --> 02:06:52,037
GEORGE W. BUSH COULDN'T GET A 

281
02:06:52,037 --> 02:06:54,073
BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION DEAL, NOR

282
02:06:54,073 --> 02:06:55,441
COULD BARACK OBAMA.

283
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:56,975
THE PRESIDENT, BYRON PITTS, 

284
02:06:56,975 --> 02:06:58,009
HOPING THE ECONOMY IS THE GLUE 

285
02:06:58,009 --> 02:06:59,277
THAT HOLDS PEOPLE TOGETHER, AS 

286
02:06:59,277 --> 02:07:01,046
HE WORKS HIS WAY UP TO THE 

287
02:07:01,046 --> 02:07:01,279
PODIUM.

288
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:02,948
HE TALKED ABOUT LOWEST BLACK 

289
02:07:02,948 --> 02:07:04,883
UNEMPLOYMENT IN YEARS, BUT 

290
02:07:04,883 --> 02:07:05,951
CHARLOTTESVILLE, ON MANY MINDS, 

291
02:07:05,951 --> 02:07:09,021
ALSO THOSE COMMENTS HE MADE 

292
02:07:09,021 --> 02:07:12,591
ABOUT AFRICAN HAITI.

293
02:07:12,591 --> 02:07:13,725
>> PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 

294
02:07:13,725 --> 02:07:14,626
BELIEVE HE'S AGAINST THEM.

295
02:07:14,626 --> 02:07:16,895
YOU TALK ABOUT THOSE EMPLOYMENT 

296
02:07:16,895 --> 02:07:18,464
NUMBERS, YES, HISTORIC.

297
02:07:18,464 --> 02:07:19,498
LOWEST THEY'VE BEEN FOR 

298
02:07:19,498 --> 02:07:20,466
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BUT CONSIDER 

299
02:07:20,466 --> 02:07:20,666
THIS.

300
02:07:20,666 --> 02:07:22,601
THIS IS THE SLOWEST DROP IN 

301
02:07:22,601 --> 02:07:24,670
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR BLACKS IN FIVE 

302
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:25,304
YEARS.

303
02:07:25,304 --> 02:07:27,606
AND BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL 

304
02:07:27,606 --> 02:07:29,541
TWICE THAT OF WHITE AMERICA.

305
02:07:29,541 --> 02:07:31,143
SO, HE HAS TO IMPACT THOSE 

306
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:34,012
NUMBERS BEFORE HE CHANGES MINDS.

307
02:07:34,012 --> 02:07:35,047
>> THE PRESIDENT HANDING HIS 

308
02:07:35,047 --> 02:07:37,015
SPEECH TO THE SPEAKER OF THE 

309
02:07:37,015 --> 02:07:38,217
HOUSE, PAUL RYAN, VICE PRESIDENT

310
02:07:38,217 --> 02:07:38,851
MIKE PENCE.

311
02:07:38,851 --> 02:07:42,087
LOOKS LIKE HE'S READY TO GET TO 

312
02:07:42,087 --> 02:07:51,030
WORK.

313
02:07:55,834 --> 02:07:57,269
MARTHA RADDATZ, WE SAW THE 

314
02:07:57,269 --> 02:07:58,804
PRESIDENT WORK HIS WAY PAST 

315
02:07:58,804 --> 02:08:00,205
SEVERAL GENERALS THERE, 

316
02:08:00,205 --> 02:08:01,073
INCLUDING MANY THAT WORK FOR 

317
02:08:01,073 --> 02:08:01,239
HIM.

318
02:08:01,239 --> 02:08:02,574
>> MANY, MANY GENERALS WORKING 

319
02:08:02,574 --> 02:08:03,642
FOR HIM.

320
02:08:03,642 --> 02:08:04,743
SECRETARY MATTIS, RETIRED 

321
02:08:04,743 --> 02:08:06,712
GENERAL, OF COURSE, H.R. 

322
02:08:06,712 --> 02:08:08,814
McMASTER, AND JOHN KELLY, HIS 

323
02:08:08,814 --> 02:08:09,515
CHIEF OF STAFF.

324
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:12,117
YOU SAW HIM PASS BY THE JOINT 

325
02:08:12,117 --> 02:08:12,350
CHIEFS.

326
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:14,052
I OFTEN HAVE PEOPLE ASK ME WHY 

327
02:08:14,052 --> 02:08:15,754
THEY ARE SO SERIOUS AND STERN AT

328
02:08:15,754 --> 02:08:17,923
THESE THINGS, THEY'RE NOT 

329
02:08:17,923 --> 02:08:18,924
SUPPOSED TO CLAP UNLESS IT'S 

330
02:08:18,924 --> 02:08:20,159
ABOUT THE TROOPS.

331
02:08:20,159 --> 02:08:21,894
SO, WE'LL KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT.

332
02:08:21,894 --> 02:08:23,461
>> ONLY CLAP IN SUPPORT -- 

333
02:08:23,461 --> 02:08:25,497
>> NOTHING POLICY OR POLITICS.

334
02:08:25,497 --> 02:08:26,731
>> AND WE REMEMBER WHEN THE 

335
02:08:26,731 --> 02:08:27,966
PRESIDENT HAD THAT INFAMOUS 

336
02:08:27,966 --> 02:08:29,434
CABINET MEETING AND HE WAS 

337
02:08:29,434 --> 02:08:31,870
SURROUNDED BY PRAISE FROM HIS 

338
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:33,138
FELLOW CABINET MEMBERS, IT WAS 

339
02:08:33,138 --> 02:08:35,374
GENERAL MATTIS.

340
02:08:35,374 --> 02:08:36,675
>> AND THAT'S ALL HE DID.

341
02:08:36,675 --> 02:08:37,709
EVERYONE ELSE SAID SOMETHING 

342
02:08:37,709 --> 02:08:39,912
VERY NICE ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP,

343
02:08:39,912 --> 02:08:42,014
AND GENERAL MATTIS SAID, WE'RE 

344
02:08:42,014 --> 02:08:43,682
PROUD OF OUR TROOPS.

345
02:08:43,682 --> 02:08:44,650
>> DEMOCRATIC LEADER OF THE 

346
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:48,387

347
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,522
NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM THE SPEAKER.

ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS.

349
02:08:59,865 --> 02:09:01,933
>> MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, I HAVE 

350
02:09:01,933 --> 02:09:04,135
THE HIGH PRIVILEGE AND THE 

351
02:09:04,135 --> 02:09:08,040
DISTINCT HONOR OF PRESENTING YOU

352
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:08,674
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

353
02:09:08,674 --> 02:09:12,110

354
02:09:12,110 --> 02:09:13,178
>> ANOTHER BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE

355
02:09:13,178 --> 02:09:14,546
AS THE PRESIDENT TAKES THAT IN.

356
02:09:14,546 --> 02:09:17,683
I WANT TO WELCOME IN OUR NEWEST 

357
02:09:17,683 --> 02:09:19,318
ABC CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER GOVERNOR

02:09:19,318 --> 02:09:20,552
OF NEW JERSEY, CHRIS CHRISTIE.

359
02:09:20,552 --> 02:09:21,686
ONE THING THE PRESIDENT WON'T 

360
02:09:21,686 --> 02:09:22,788
MENTION TONIGHT, SOMETHING 

361
02:09:22,788 --> 02:09:23,622
THAT'S HUNG OVER HIS HEAD FOR 

362
02:09:23,622 --> 02:09:25,390
MUCH OF THIS LAST YEAR, THE 

363
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:26,058
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

364
02:09:26,058 --> 02:09:27,426
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.

365
02:09:27,426 --> 02:09:28,861
>> NO, HE WON'T, GEORGE.

366
02:09:28,861 --> 02:09:30,529
AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR THE 

367
02:09:30,529 --> 02:09:31,697
COUNTRY AND GOOD FOR THE 

368
02:09:31,697 --> 02:09:32,030
PRESIDENT.

369
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:33,698
IT AGGRAVATING HIM, IT ANGERS 

370
02:09:33,698 --> 02:09:35,267
HIM AND THAT'S NOT THE PRESIDENT

371
02:09:35,267 --> 02:09:36,435
WE NEED TO SEE TONIGHT.

372
02:09:36,435 --> 02:09:37,502

1122

1123
02:55:21,978 --> 02:55:22,211
SECRET?

HE SAID, WE'RE JUST TOUGHER THAN

1125
02:55:24,913 --> 02:55:26,415
THEY ARE, AND I LIKED THAT 

1126
02:55:26,415 --> 02:55:30,486

1127
02:55:30,486 --> 02:55:34,824
NOW, LET'S GET CONGRESS TO SEND 

1128

1129

THIS GREAT CHAMBER HAVE TO DO 

1130
02:55:38,394 --> 02:55:40,596
IT, WE HAVE NO CHOICE, C.J., 

1131
02:55:40,596 --> 02:55:42,565
WE'RE GOING TO SEND YOU

IT'S WHAT YOU NEED.

OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, THE 

1136
02:55:54,276 --> 02:55:56,345
HOUSE AND SENATE WILL BE VOTING 

1137
02:55:56,345 --> 02:55:59,882
ON AN IMMIGRATION REFORM

1139
02:56:00,115 --> 02:56:02,184
IN RECENT MONTHS, MY 

1140
02:56:02,184 --> 02:56:03,685
ADMINISTRATION HAS MET 

1141
02:56:03,685 --> 02:56:04,386
EXTENSIVELY WITH BOTH DEMOCRATS 

1142
02:56:04,386 --> 02:56:08,223
AND REPUBLICANS TO CRAFT A 

1143
02:56:08,223 --> 02:56:10,960
BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO 

1144
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:12,662
IMMIGRATION REFORM.

1145
02:56:12,662 --> 02:56:15,998
BASED ON THESE DISCUSSIONS, WE 

1146
02:56:15,998 --> 02:56:18,067
PRESENTED CONGRESS WITH A 

1147
02:56:18,067 --> 02:56:20,136
DETAILED PROPOSAL THAT SHOULD BE

1148
02:56:20,136 --> 02:56:21,870
SUPPORTED BY BOTH PARTIES AS A 

1149
02:56:21,870 --> 02:56:23,706
FAIR COMPROMISE.

1150
02:56:23,706 --> 02:56:25,241
ONE WHERE NOBODY GETS EVERYTHING

1151
02:56:25,241 --> 02:56:28,443
THEY WANT, BUT WHERE OUR COUNTRY

1152
02:56:28,443 --> 02:56:30,846
GETS THE CRITICAL REFORMS IT 

1153
02:56:30,846 --> 02:56:46,362
NEEDS AND MUST HAVE.

1154
02:56:46,362 --> 02:56:47,262
HERE ARE THE FOUR PILLARS OF OUR

1155
02:56:47,262 --> 02:56:49,899
PLAN.

1156
02:56:49,899 --> 02:56:53,936
THE FIRST PILLAR OF OUR 

1157
02:56:53,936 --> 02:56:55,104
FRAMEWORK GENEROUSLY OFFERS A 

1158
02:56:55,104 --> 02:56:59,007
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR 1.8 

1159
02:56:59,007 --> 02:57:01,110
MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO 

1160
02:57:01,110 --> 02:57:02,611
WERE BROUGHT HERE BY THEIR 

1161
02:57:02,611 --> 02:57:04,980
PARENTS AS A YOUNG AGE.

1162
02:57:04,980 --> 02:57:09,218
THAT COVERS ALMOST THREE TIMES 

1163
02:57:09,218 --> 02:57:11,587
MORE PEOPLE THAN THE PREVIOUS 

1164
02:57:11,587 --> 02:57:18,728
ADMINISTRATION COVERED.

1165
02:57:18,728 --> 02:57:22,464
UNDER OUR PLAN, THOSE WHO MEET 

1166
02:57:22,464 --> 02:57:24,233
EDUCATION AND WORK REQUIREMENTS 

1167
02:57:24,233 --> 02:57:26,135
AND SHOW GOOD MORAL CHARACTER 

1168
02:57:26,135 --> 02:57:27,069
WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME FULL

CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES 

1170
02:57:29,238 --> 02:57:37,980
OVER A 12-YEAR PERIOD.

1171
02:57:37,980 --> 02:57:40,415
THE SECOND PILLAR FULLY SECURES 

1172
02:57:40,415 --> 02:57:53,396
THE BORDER.

[ APPLAUSE ]

1174
02:58:00,736 --> 02:58:01,737
THAT MEANS BUILDING A GREAT WALL

1175
02:58:01,737 --> 02:58:03,972
ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND IT 

1176
02:58:03,972 --> 02:58:07,176
MEANS HIRING MORE HEROES LIKE 

1177
02:58:07,176 --> 02:58:10,045
C.J. TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES 

1178
02:58:10,045 --> 02:58:23,359
SAFE.

1179
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:25,227
CRUCIALLY, OUR PLAN CLOSES THE 

1180
02:58:25,227 --> 02:58:27,897
TERRIBLE LOOPHOLES EXPLOITED BY 

1181
02:58:27,897 --> 02:58:28,664
CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS TO 

1182
02:58:28,664 --> 02:58:32,101
ENTER OUR COUNTRY AND IT FINALLY

1183
02:58:32,101 --> 02:58:35,804
ENDS THE HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS 

1184
02:58:35,804 --> 02:58:50,820
PRACTICE OF CATCH AND RELEASE.

1185
02:58:50,820 --> 02:58:54,890
THE THIRD PILLAR ENDS THE VISA 

1186
02:58:54,890 --> 02:58:56,792
LOTTERY, A PROGRAM THAT RANDOMLY

1187
02:58:56,792 --> 02:58:58,126
HANDS OUT GREEN CARDS WITHOUT 

1188
02:58:58,126 --> 02:59:01,097
ANY REGARD FOR SKILL, MERIT OR 

1189
02:59:01,097 --> 02:59:15,878
THE SAFETY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1190
02:59:15,878 --> 02:59:17,947
IT'S TIME TO BEGIN MOVING TOWARD

1191
02:59:17,947 --> 02:59:20,316
A MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION 

1192
02:59:20,316 --> 02:59:21,583
SYSTEM, ONE THAT ADMITS PEOPLE 

1193
02:59:21,583 --> 02:59:24,453
WHO ARE SKILLED, WHO WANT TO 

1194
02:59:24,453 --> 02:59:27,022
WORK, WHO WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR

1195
02:59:27,022 --> 02:59:29,258
SOCIETY AND WHO WILL LOVE AND 

1196
02:59:29,258 --> 02:59:37,066

[ APPLAUSE ]

1198
02:59:46,408 --> 02:59:47,676
THE FOURTH AND FINAL PILLAR 

1199
02:59:47,676 --> 02:59:51,280
PROTECTS THE NUCLEAR FAMILY BY 

1200
02:59:51,280 --> 03:00:03,025
ENDING CHAIN MIGRATION.

1201
03:00:03,025 --> 03:00:05,494
UNDER THE CURRENT BROKEN SYSTEM,

1202
03:00:05,494 --> 03:00:07,796
A SINGLE IMMIGRANT CAN BRING IN 

1203
03:00:07,796 --> 03:00:11,099
VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF 

1204
03:00:11,099 --> 03:00:13,469
DISTANT RELATIVES.

1205
03:00:13,469 --> 03:00:17,439
UNDER OUR PLAN, WE FOCUS ON THE 

1206
03:00:17,439 --> 03:00:19,775
IMMEDIATE FAMILY BY LIMITING 

1207
03:00:19,775 --> 03:00:20,943
SPONSORSHIPS TO SPOUSES AND 

1208
03:00:20,943 --> 03:00:30,552
MINOR CHILDREN.

1209
03:00:30,552 --> 03:00:32,921
THIS VITAL REFORM IS NECESSARY, 

1210
03:00:32,921 --> 03:00:35,390
NOT JUST FOR OUR ECONOMY, BUT 

1211
03:00:35,390 --> 03:00:40,996
FOR OUR SECURITY AND FOR THE 

1212
03:00:40,996 --> 03:00:41,396
FUTURE OF AMERICA.

1213
03:00:41,396 --> 03:00:44,399
IN RECENT WEEKS, TWO TERRORIST 

1214
03:00:44,399 --> 03:00:45,868
ATTACKS IN NEW YORK WERE MADE 

1215
03:00:45,868 --> 03:00:49,171
POSSIBLE BY THE VISA LOTTERY AND

1216
03:00:49,171 --> 03:00:49,705
CHAIN MIGRATION.

1217
03:00:49,705 --> 03:00:52,107
IN THE AGE OF TERRORISM, THESE 

1218
03:00:52,107 --> 03:00:55,844
PROGRAMS PRESENT RISKS WE CAN 

1219
03:00:55,844 --> 03:00:59,682

1220
03:00:59,682 --> 03:01:06,388
IT'S TIME TO REFORM.

1221
03:01:06,388 --> 03:01:07,990
IT'S TIME TO REFORM THESE 

1222
03:01:07,990 --> 03:01:09,925
OUTDATED IMMIGRATION RULES AND 

1223
03:01:09,925 --> 03:01:12,061
FINALLY BRING OUR IMMIGRATION

1225
03:01:22,338 --> 03:01:24,240
THESE FOUR PILLARS REPRESENT A 

1226

1230

FOR OVER 30 YEARS, WASHINGTON 

1231
03:01:35,384 --> 03:01:37,252
HAS TRIED AND FAILED TO SOLVE 

1232
03:01:37,252 --> 03:01:40,222
THIS PROBLEM.

1233
03:01:40,222 --> 03:01:42,691
THIS CONGRESS CAN BE THE ONE 

1234
03:01:42,691 --> 03:01:47,096
THAT FINALLY MAKES IT HAPPEN.

1235
03:01:47,096 --> 03:01:49,064
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THESE FOUR 

1236
03:01:49,064 --> 03:01:50,799
PILLARS WILL PRODUCE LEGISLATION

1237
03:01:50,799 --> 03:01:55,270
THAT FULFILLS MY IRONCLAD PLEDGE

1238
03:01:55,270 --> 03:01:57,472
TO SIGN A BILL THAT PUTS AMERICA

1241

1242

THE JOB DONE.

1243
03:02:32,908 --> 03:02:36,445
THESE REFORMS WILL ALSO SUPPORT 

1244

03:34:01,294 --> 03:34:02,595
ARE THINGS THAT WILL CERTAINLY 

1832
03:34:02,595 --> 03:34:04,965
MAKE HIS BASE HAPPY, BUT NOT 

1833
03:34:04,965 --> 03:34:05,932
NECESSARILY SOMETHING I 

1834
03:34:05,932 --> 03:34:06,666
ANTICIPATED IN THIS KIND OF 

1835
03:34:06,666 --> 03:34:08,135
STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH.

1836
03:34:08,135 --> 03:34:10,537
LIKE I SAID, IT WAS A LOT MORE 

1837
03:34:10,537 --> 03:34:12,973
DIVISIVE THAN I ANTICIPATED, BUT

1838
03:34:12,973 --> 03:34:14,474
I'M SURE CONSERVATIVES WILL BE 

1839
03:34:14,474 --> 03:34:14,908
HAPPY TONIGHT.

1840
03:34:14,908 --> 03:34:16,276
>> MATTHEW DOWD, DID THE 

1841
03:34:16,276 --> 03:34:17,377
PRESIDENT DELIVER WHAT HE TALKED

1842
03:34:17,377 --> 03:34:18,812
TO YOU ABOUT EARLIER TODAY?

1843
03:34:18,812 --> 03:34:21,047
>> WHAT I WAS THINKING AS I WAS 

1844
03:34:21,047 --> 03:34:22,582
LISTENING TO THE SPEECH, IS THAT

1845
03:34:22,582 --> 03:34:23,416
THE PRESIDENT MET WITH ME AFTER 

1846
03:34:23,416 --> 03:34:25,986
THE SPEECH, I WOULD SAY TO HIM, 

1847
03:34:25,986 --> 03:34:28,155
WELL, THAT WAS HOW NOT TO GIVE A

1848
03:34:28,155 --> 03:34:28,555
UNIFYING SPEECH.

1849
03:34:28,555 --> 03:34:35,329
SO, LET'S GOING BACK AND GIVE A 

1850
03:34:35,329 --> 03:34:38,498
UNIFYING SPEECH.

1851
03:34:38,498 --> 03:34:40,667
CALLING THIS A HEALING SPEECH IS

1852
03:34:40,667 --> 03:34:42,669
ALMOST LIKE CALLING, GOING ON A 

1853
03:34:42,669 --> 03:34:44,304
DIET BY DRINKING A DIET COKE AND

1854
03:34:44,304 --> 03:34:45,572
EATING A PIZZA.

1855
03:34:45,572 --> 03:34:47,174
THAT'S AS MUCH OF A HEALING 

1856
03:34:47,174 --> 03:34:47,541
SPEECH THIS WAS.

1857
03:34:47,541 --> 03:34:48,809
>> DAVID, THE PRESIDENT SOUNDED 

1858
03:34:48,809 --> 03:34:49,810
LIKE HE MEANT IT WHEN HE SAID 

1859
03:34:49,810 --> 03:34:50,344
IT.

1860
03:34:50,344 --> 03:34:52,746
>> HE REALLY DID, AND, YOU KNOW,

1861
03:34:52,746 --> 03:34:53,546
TO MEGHAN McCAIN'S POINT, IT 

1862
03:34:53,546 --> 03:34:56,382
WILL MAKE CONSERVATIVES HAPPY, I

1863
03:34:56,382 --> 03:34:57,517
WAS THINKING ABOUT THE VOTERS WE

1864
03:34:57,517 --> 03:34:58,885
TALKED TO IN PENNSYLVANIA, 

1865
03:34:58,885 --> 03:34:59,753
MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, IN 

1866
03:34:59,753 --> 03:35:01,021
PARTICULAR TO DISTRICTS WHERE IT

1867
03:35:01,021 --> 03:35:02,689
WAS LESS THAN 1%, THE DIFFERENCE

1868
03:35:02,689 --> 03:35:03,590
BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY

1869
03:35:03,590 --> 03:35:04,624
CLINTON, AND THEN WHEN WE WERE 

1870
03:35:04,624 --> 03:35:06,093
AT THAT LUNCH TODAY AT THE WHITE

1871
03:35:06,093 --> 03:35:07,427
HOUSE, AND I ASKED HIM, WHAT 

1872
03:35:07,427 --> 03:35:08,895
WILL HE SAY TO THE PEOPLE WHO 

1873
03:35:08,895 --> 03:35:10,697
ARE STILL NOT CONVINCED HE 

1874
03:35:10,697 --> 03:35:11,531
HASN'T BROUGHT ANYMORE PEOPLE 

1875
03:35:11,531 --> 03:35:12,966
INTO THE FRAY IN MANY OF THE 

1876
03:35:12,966 --> 03:35:14,601
PLACES WE TALKED TO THEM, AND HE

1877
03:35:14,601 --> 03:35:15,535
SAID, I WOULD CONSIDER IT A 

1878
03:35:15,535 --> 03:35:16,936
GREAT ACHIEVEMENT IF WE COULD 

1879
03:35:16,936 --> 03:35:18,505
MAKE OUR COUNTRY UNITED.

1880
03:35:18,505 --> 03:35:20,506
THAT'S WHAT WE TOLD US TODAY, IF

1881
03:35:20,506 --> 03:35:22,009
I COULD UNITE THIS COUNTRY.

1882
03:35:22,009 --> 03:35:23,910
AS YOU CAN SEE IN THAT CHAMBER 

1883
03:35:23,910 --> 03:35:25,412
TONIGHT, DEMOCRATS RARELY 

1884
03:35:25,412 --> 03:35:26,746
STANDING, AND CERTAINLY NOT ON 

1885
03:35:26,746 --> 03:35:28,882
ANY OF THE POLICY PROPOSALS.

1886
03:35:28,882 --> 03:35:30,384
NOT EVEN ON INFRASTRUCTURE, 

1887
03:35:30,384 --> 03:35:31,051
GEORGE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE 

1888
03:35:31,051 --> 03:35:32,352
DEMOCRATS HAVE TALKED LONG 

1889
03:35:32,352 --> 03:35:34,120
ABOUT, AS WELL. 

1890
03:35:34,120 --> 03:35:36,556
>> MARTHA RADDATZ, HE DID TRY TO

1891
03:35:36,556 --> 03:35:39,893
GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR 

1892
03:35:39,893 --> 03:35:41,194
SUPPORTING THE TROOPS.

1893
03:35:41,194 --> 03:35:42,896
>> THAT'S AN EASY ONE, FOR 

1894
03:35:42,896 --> 03:35:43,630
SUPPORTING THE TROOPS.

1895
03:35:43,630 --> 03:35:45,465
YOU'RE GOING TO GET APPLAUSE FOR

1896
03:35:45,465 --> 03:35:45,665
THAT.

1897
03:35:45,665 --> 03:35:47,033
IT WAS JUST A PARTICULARLY 

1898
03:35:47,033 --> 03:35:47,601
GLOOMY SPEECH.

1899
03:35:47,601 --> 03:35:49,836
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T MENTION THE 

1900
03:35:49,836 --> 03:35:51,137
WORD CARNAGE, BUT HE TALKED A 

1901
03:35:51,137 --> 03:35:52,672
LOT ABOUT CARNAGE.

1902
03:35:52,672 --> 03:35:56,043
IT WAS A SAD SPEECH THERE AT THE

1903
03:35:56,043 --> 03:35:58,744
END AND DID NOT UNIFY, EXACTLY 

1904
03:35:58,744 --> 03:35:59,913
WHAT EVERYBODY IS SAYING ABOUT 

1905
03:35:59,913 --> 03:36:02,715
NOT UNIFYING THE DEMOCRATS.

1906
03:36:02,715 --> 03:36:06,053
THEY RESPECT PEOPLE IN THE 

1907
03:36:06,053 --> 03:36:09,222
COUNTRY WHO PROBABLY FEEL HOW 

1908
03:36:09,222 --> 03:36:09,456
THEY DO.

1909
03:36:09,456 --> 03:36:11,057
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE, ARE WE 

1910
03:36:11,057 --> 03:36:11,858
MISSING SOMETHING HERE?

1911
03:36:11,858 --> 03:36:14,861
>> IT WAS A TRADITIONAL STATE OF

1912
03:36:14,861 --> 03:36:16,296
THE UNION SPEECH.

1913
03:36:16,296 --> 03:36:17,430
I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO LONG, BUT 

1914
03:36:17,430 --> 03:36:20,434
IN THE END, GEORGE, I WOULD 

1915
03:36:20,434 --> 03:36:21,468
DISAGREE WITH MARTHA AND SOME OF

1916
03:36:21,468 --> 03:36:23,170
THE OTHERS ON THIS, THE 

1917
03:36:23,170 --> 03:36:25,005
DEMOCRATS WERE NOT STANDING FOR 

1918
03:36:25,005 --> 03:36:25,272
ANYTHING.

1919
03:36:25,272 --> 03:36:25,505
NOTHING.

1920
03:36:25,505 --> 03:36:26,439
EVEN THE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY 

1921
03:36:26,439 --> 03:36:27,774
CAN BE UNIFIED ON.

1922
03:36:27,774 --> 03:36:28,442
THEY DIDN'T STAND ON.

1923
03:36:28,442 --> 03:36:30,176
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, 

1924
03:36:30,176 --> 03:36:34,047
THEY'RE IN 2018 MIDTERM ELECTION

1925
03:36:34,047 --> 03:36:34,647
WAR FOOTING.

1926
03:36:34,647 --> 03:36:35,949
NOW, THE PRESIDENT MAYBE COULD 

1927
03:36:35,949 --> 03:36:37,617
HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, 

1928
03:36:37,617 --> 03:36:38,852
SHORTENED IT, GOT A BIGGER AND 

1929
03:36:38,852 --> 03:36:40,387
MORE UNIFYING THEME, BUT IN THE 

1930
03:36:40,387 --> 03:36:41,387
END, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD 

1931
03:36:41,387 --> 03:36:42,455
HAVE EVEN STOOD UP THEN.

1932
03:36:42,455 --> 03:36:44,090
THAT WAS A PRETTY GLUM LOOKING 

1933
03:36:44,090 --> 03:36:45,625
GROUP OF DEMOCRATS ALL THROUGH 

1934
03:36:45,625 --> 03:36:46,993
THE EVENING.

1935
03:36:46,993 --> 03:36:48,428
>> COKIE ROBERTS, WAS THAT A 

1936
03:36:48,428 --> 03:36:50,162
MISTAKE FOR THE DEMOCRATS?

1937
03:36:50,162 --> 03:36:50,763
>> WELL, THEY PROBABLY SHOULD 

1938
03:36:50,763 --> 03:36:54,200
HAVE BEEN SOME WHAT MORE 

1939
03:36:54,200 --> 03:36:54,934
ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

1940
03:36:54,934 --> 03:36:55,402
CAME IN.

1941
03:36:55,402 --> 03:36:56,402
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM NOT 

1942
03:36:56,402 --> 03:37:00,373
CLAPPING FOR A PRESIDENT WHO 

1943
03:37:00,373 --> 03:37:01,741
ENTERS THE CHAMBER, BUT HE DID 

1944
03:37:01,741 --> 03:37:03,944
DO A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT 

1945
03:37:03,944 --> 03:37:06,313
CLEARLY DID MAKE THEM ANGRY, 

1946
03:37:06,313 --> 03:37:10,150
AND, YOU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT THE

1947
03:37:10,150 --> 03:37:10,683
NAT

1948
03:37:10,683 --> 03:37:11,751
NATIONAL -- STANDING FOR THE 

1949
03:37:11,751 --> 03:37:15,789
NATIONAL ANTHEM, THERE WERE MANY

1950
03:37:15,789 --> 03:37:16,222
ME

1951
03:37:16,222 --> 03:37:17,323
MEMBERS THERE WEARING AFRICAN 

1952
03:37:17,323 --> 03:37:17,858
CLOTH.

1953
03:37:17,858 --> 03:37:19,159
THE PRESIDENT NEVER MENTIONED 

1954
03:37:19,159 --> 03:37:19,993
AFRICA, NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE

1955
03:37:19,993 --> 03:37:23,697
THAT, SO, THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING

1956
03:37:23,697 --> 03:37:24,264
THERE FOR THEM TO RELATE TO.

1957
03:37:24,264 --> 03:37:25,065
>> PRESIDENT HAS LEFT THE 

1958
03:37:25,065 --> 03:37:25,298
CHAMBER.

1959
03:37:25,298 --> 03:37:26,500
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

1960
03:37:26,500 --> 03:37:26,700
BREAK.

1961
03:37:26,700 --> 03:37:27,634
WHEN WE COME BACK, THE 

1962
03:37:27,634 --> 03:37:32,005
DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE WITH 

1963
03:37:32,005 --> 03:37:33,006
CONGRESSMAN JOE FSEPH KENNEDY.

1964
03:37:33,006 --> 03:37:33,673
>> Announcer: NEXT, HE'S THE 

1965
03:37:33,673 --> 03:37:35,241
GRANDSON OF LIBERAL ICON BOBBY 

1966
03:37:35,241 --> 03:37:38,711
KENNEDY AND THE GRAND NEPHEW OF 

1967
03:37:38,711 --> 03:37:40,347
SENATOR TED KENNEDY.

1968
03:37:40,347 --> 03:37:42,048
37-YEAR-OLD CONGRESSMAN FROM 

1969
03:37:42,048 --> 03:37:44,251
MASSACHUSETTS, JOE KENNEDY III.

1970
03:37:44,251 --> 03:37:46,019
HOW WILL HE RESPOND?

1971
03:37:46,019 --> 03:37:47,053
ABC NEWS LIVE COVERAGE OF THE 

1972
03:37:47,053 --> 03:37:49,556
STATE OF THE UNION AND THE 

1973
03:37:49,556 --> 03:37:50,090
DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE WILL 

1974
03:37:50,090 --> 03:41:07,153
CONTINUE IN A MOMENT.

1975
03:41:07,153 --> 03:41:08,121
>>> AND WE ARE BACK.

1976
03:41:08,121 --> 03:41:09,255
ABOUT TO GET THE DEMOCRATIC 

1977
03:41:09,255 --> 03:41:10,590
RESPONSE FROM CONGRESSMAN JOE 

1978
03:41:10,590 --> 03:41:12,592
KENNEDY FROM FALL RIVER, 

1979
03:41:12,592 --> 03:41:12,925
MASSACHUSETTS.

1980
03:41:12,925 --> 03:41:16,129
A THIRD GENERATION OF KENNEDYS.

1981
03:41:16,129 --> 03:41:18,965
I WANT TO BRING IN STEPHANIE 

1982
03:41:18,965 --> 03:41:20,533
CUTTER, WHO HAS WORKED CLOSELY 

1983
03:41:20,533 --> 03:41:21,768
WITH THE KENNEDY FAMILY.

1984
03:41:21,768 --> 03:41:24,570
A GRANDSON OF BOBBY KENNEDY.

1985
03:41:24,570 --> 03:41:26,639
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1986
03:41:26,639 --> 03:41:28,341
CONGRESSMAN KENNEDY HAS A STRONG

1987
03:41:28,341 --> 03:41:30,043
REPUTATION OF BEING A WORKHORSE.

1988
03:41:30,043 --> 03:41:31,711
NOW A SHOW BOAT, WHICH, AS YOU 

1989
03:41:31,711 --> 03:41:34,080
KNOW, IS UNUSUAL IN CONGRESS.

1990
03:41:34,080 --> 03:41:36,082
HE'S VERY POPULAR AT HOME IN 

1991
03:41:36,082 --> 03:41:36,416
MASSACHUSETTS.

1992
03:41:36,416 --> 03:41:38,017
AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL SEE 

1993
03:41:38,017 --> 03:41:39,885
TONIGHT IS UNLIKE WHAT WAS 

1994
03:41:39,885 --> 03:41:40,920
BILLED FOR THE PRESIDENT'S 

1995
03:41:40,920 --> 03:41:42,188
SPEECH, THIS WILL BE A REAL 

1996
03:41:42,188 --> 03:41:44,290
UNIFYING SPEECH.

1997
03:41:44,290 --> 03:41:45,525
THAT'S WHAT -- THAT'S WHERE HIS 

1998
03:41:45,525 --> 03:41:46,760
PASSION IS, IN BRINGING PEOPLE 

1999
03:41:46,760 --> 03:41:47,293
TOGETHER.

2000
03:41:47,293 --> 03:41:48,728
HE'S SOLUTION-ORIENTED.

2001
03:41:48,728 --> 03:41:50,363
THAT'S HIS REPUTATION IN 

2002
03:41:50,363 --> 03:41:50,696
MASSACHUSETTS.

2003
03:41:50,696 --> 03:41:51,297
AND I THINK WE'LL SEE IT.

2004
03:41:51,297 --> 03:41:53,099
>> HE WILL BE SPEAKING BEFORE A 

2005
03:41:53,099 --> 03:41:55,301
SMALL CROWD IN FALL RIVER, 

2006
03:41:55,301 --> 03:41:56,035
MASSACHUSETTS.

2007
03:41:56,035 --> 03:41:56,702
CONGRESSMAN JOE KENNEDY, COMING 

2008
03:41:56,702 --> 03:42:05,945
UP RIGHT NOW.

2009
03:42:07,380 --> 03:42:08,815
>> THANK YOU.

2010
03:42:08,815 --> 03:42:10,150

THANK YOU.

2015
03:42:20,326 --> 03:42:22,395
GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND 

2016
03:42:22,395 --> 03:42:22,662
GENTLEMEN.

2017
03:42:22,662 --> 03:42:24,831
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIVILEGE TO 

2018
03:42:24,831 --> 03:42:25,298
JOIN YOU ALL TONIGHT.

2019
03:42:25,298 --> 03:42:30,003
WE ARE HERE IN FALL RIVER, 

2020
03:42:30,003 --> 03:42:32,806
MASSACHUSETTS, A PROUD AMERICAN 

2021
03:42:32,806 --> 03:42:41,748
CITY.

2022
03:42:41,748 --> 03:42:43,149
AN AMERICAN CITY BUILT BY 

2023
03:42:43,149 --> 03:42:51,591
IMMIGRANTS.

2024
03:42:51,591 --> 03:42:55,094
FROM TECH TILES TO ROBOTS, THIS 

2025
03:42:55,094 --> 03:42:56,862
IS A PLACE THAT KNOWS HOW TO 

2026
03:42:56,862 --> 03:43:03,102
MAKE GREAT THINGS.

2027
03:43:03,102 --> 03:43:05,972
THE STUDENTS THAT ARE WITH US 

2028
03:43:05,972 --> 03:43:09,875

2030
03:43:14,013 --> 03:43:20,753
LEGACY.

2031
03:43:20,753 --> 03:43:23,456
LIKE MANY AMERICAN HOMETOWNS, 

2032
03:43:23,456 --> 03:43:24,557
FALL RIVER HAS FACED ITS SHARE 

2033
03:43:24,557 --> 03:43:26,793
OF STORMS.

2034
03:43:26,793 --> 03:43:29,696
BUT THE PEOPLE HERE ARE TOUGH.

2035
03:43:29,696 --> 03:43:31,664
THEY FIGHT FOR EACH OTHER, THEY 

2036
03:43:31,664 --> 03:43:34,367
PULL FOR THEIR CITY.

2037
03:43:34,367 --> 03:43:36,535
IT IS A FITTING PLACE TO GATHER,

2038
03:43:36,535 --> 03:43:39,505
AS OUR NATION REFLECTS ON THE 

2039
03:43:39,505 --> 03:43:42,408
STATE OF OUR UNION.

2040
03:43:42,408 --> 03:43:45,345
THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK.

2041
03:43:45,345 --> 03:43:47,313
AND MANY HAVE SPENT THE LAST 

2042
03:43:47,313 --> 03:43:54,387
YEAR ANXIOUS, ANGRY, AFRAID.

2043
03:43:54,387 --> 03:43:57,356
WE ALL FEEL THE FRACTURED FAULT 

2044
03:43:57,356 --> 03:43:58,057
LINES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.

2045
03:43:58,057 --> 03:44:00,626
WE HEAR THE VOICES OF AMERICANS 

2046
03:44:00,626 --> 03:44:03,396
WHO ARE FORGOTTEN AND FEEL 

2047
03:44:03,396 --> 03:44:05,398
FORSAKEN.

2048
03:44:05,398 --> 03:44:07,767
WE SEE AN ECONOMY THAT MAKES 

2049
03:44:07,767 --> 03:44:10,670
STOCKS SOAR, INVESTOR PORTFOLIOS

2050
03:44:10,670 --> 03:44:11,971
BULGE AND CORPORATE PROFITS 

2051
03:44:11,971 --> 03:44:13,806
CLIMB, BUT FAILS TO GIVE WORKERS

2052
03:44:13,806 --> 03:44:18,278
THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE REWARD.

2053
03:44:18,278 --> 03:44:19,478
A GOVERNMENT THAT STRUGGLES TO 

2054
03:44:19,478 --> 03:44:23,783
KEEP ITSELF OPEN.

2055
03:44:23,783 --> 03:44:27,153
RUSSIA KNEE-DEEP IN OUR 

2056
03:44:27,153 --> 03:44:27,420
DEMOCRACY.

2057
03:44:27,420 --> 03:44:30,957
AN ALL-OUT WAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL 

2058
03:44:30,957 --> 03:44:32,625
PROTECTION.

2059
03:44:32,625 --> 03:44:33,459
A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ROLLING 

2060
03:44:33,459 --> 03:44:39,098
BACK CIVIL RIGHTS BY THE DAY.

2061
03:44:39,098 --> 03:44:42,001
HATRED AND SUPREMACY PROUDLY 

2062
03:44:42,001 --> 03:44:46,372
MARCHING IN OUR STREETS.

2063
03:44:46,372 --> 03:44:49,208

CONGREGATIONS.

2067
03:44:53,379 --> 03:44:55,114
TARGETING OUR SAFEST SACRED 

2068

2069
03:44:58,251 --> 03:45:00,186
AND THIS NAGGING, SINKING 

2070
03:45:00,186 --> 03:45:02,488
FEELING, NO MATTER YOUR 

2071
03:45:02,488 --> 03:45:06,158
POLITICAL BELIEFS, THAT THIS IS 

2072
03:45:06,158 --> 03:45:06,425
NOT RIGHT.

2073
03:45:06,425 --> 03:45:22,041
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.

[ APPLAUSE ]

2075
03:45:23,276 --> 03:45:25,578
FOLKS, IT WOULD BE EASY TO 

2076
03:45:25,578 --> 03:45:32,819
DISMISS THIS PAST YEAR AS CHAOS,

2077
03:45:32,819 --> 03:45:33,920
PARTISANSHIP, POLITICS.

2078
03:45:33,920 --> 03:45:36,990
BUT IT'S FAR, FAR BIGGER THAN 

2079
03:45:36,990 --> 03:45:37,190
THAT.

2080
03:45:37,190 --> 03:45:41,160
THIS ADMINISTRATION ISN'T JUST 

2081
03:45:41,160 --> 03:45:43,463
TARGETING THE LAWS THAT PROTECT 

2082
03:45:43,463 --> 03:45:45,464
US, THEY'RE TARGETING THE VERY 

2083
03:45:45,464 --> 03:45:48,834
IDEA THAT WE ARE ALL WORTHY OF 

2084
03:45:48,834 --> 03:45:49,736
PROTECTION.

2085
03:45:49,736 --> 03:45:51,337
FOR THEM, DIGNITY ISN'T 

2086
03:45:51,337 --> 03:45:53,005
SOMETHING YOU'RE BORN WITH, BUT 

2087
03:45:53,005 --> 03:45:55,375
SOMETHING YOU MEASURE.

2088
03:45:55,375 --> 03:45:58,778

NOT TO MENTION THE GENDER OF 

2092
03:46:07,787 --> 03:46:11,391
YOUR SPOUSE, THE COUNTRY OF YOUR

2093
03:46:11,391 --> 03:46:14,794
BIRTH, THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN.

THEIR RECORD IS A REBUKE TO OUR 

2096

HIGHEST AMERICAN EYE DEEM, THE

BELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL WORTHY,

03:46:25,137 --> 03:46:26,906
THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL, THAT WE 

2099
03:46:26,906 --> 03:46:28,107
ALL COUNT, IN THE EYES OF OUR 

2100

03:46:34,447 --> 03:46:46,292

2105
03:47:02,909 --> 03:47:06,112
TODAY THAT PROMISE IS BEING 

2106
03:47:06,112 --> 03:47:08,247
BROKEN.

2107
03:47:08,247 --> 03:47:12,719
BY AN ADMINISTRATION THAT 

2108
03:47:12,719 --> 03:47:15,388
CALLUSLY APPRAISES OUR WO

2109
03:47:15,388 --> 03:47:17,557

AWAY.

2112
03:47:20,760 --> 03:47:21,527
THEY ARE TURNING AMERICAN LIFE 

2113
03:47:21,527 --> 03:47:23,595
INTO A ZERO SUM GAME WHERE FOR 

2114
03:47:23,595 --> 03:47:25,998
ONE TO WIN, ANOTHER MUST LOSE.

2115
03:47:25,998 --> 03:47:28,134
WHERE WE CAN GUARANTEE AMERICA'S

2116

WHERE WE CAN EXTEND HEALTH CARE

IN MISSISSIPPI IF WE GUT IT IN 

2120
03:47:37,076 --> 03:47:37,410
MASSACHUSETTS.

2121
03:47:37,410 --> 03:47:39,278
WE CAN CUT TAXES FOR

WHERE WE CAN TAKE CARE OF SICK

2126
03:47:49,722 --> 03:47:51,891
WE ARE BOMBARDED WITH ONE FALSE 

2127
03:47:51,891 --> 03:47:53,492

03:47:53,492 --> 03:47:56,796
COAL MINERS OR SINGLE MOMS.

PITTSBURGH, A TEACHER IN TULSA 

2134

AND A DAY CARE WORKER IN

03:48:14,747 --> 03:48:16,048
A SYSTEM FORCEFULLY RIGGED 

2138

2153
03:49:15,174 --> 03:49:15,808
