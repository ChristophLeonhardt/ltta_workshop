I've got a really fun show for you today author and columnist Kurt Schlichter is joining me we're gonna be discussing Rado cons we're gonna be discussing new US census information about the great blue state of California and we're gonna be discussing the robert muller special investigation stick around joining me now is my good friend Kurt Schlichter author columnist Cornel US Army retired Kurt before we get into anything else we've got to start on a note that I've just been dying dying to start on you invented a phrase that might be the greatest thing I've heard in all of 2017 it refers to the never Trump errs and it's Rado cons explain rado cons well you've seen the Godfather of course because you're a man oh and you know that the brother Michael is the smart vicious one and then sonny is the tough vicious one and then there's Fredo Kratos the weak the soft one and after he betrays Michael and the family sound familiar at the end Michael calls him out and he says I'm smart well that's where I was that's where I was gonna go because that's exactly where I was gonna go cuz sources told me and I know this is gonna ruin your day that on the last weekly standard Cruise Bill Kristol was on the Lido deck looking at her picture of you saying Kurt I'm smart I deserve respect and calling Jake aru's Amol Green and everybody one of these guys come on he has the glasses yeah you know there's these guys and the thing is they thought you know if I keep sucking away at the Liberty Forum for Eagle Eagle Forum Liberty committee you know as an analyst and I do my time like Mediaite or weekly standard you know I'm get respect and then these Trump people come along and say no we'd rather have results raring a bunch of time serving hacks well that's the problem right they they want to they love rhetoric they love telling us why we're wrong another phrase yet another phrase you use which I love is conservative ink and your articles they've somehow come to believe that they own the label conservatism that anybody who disagrees with them is not a conservative we're all chills well John I just was told by some 3,000 person Twitter person that reputable conservatives should dump me and all these little blue checks with backgrounds that like weekly standard and you know stayed in wherever they all like do you think you are to dump me from anything I mean literally how are you going to get me to pack my bags and go I'm in conservative for 35 years frankly I'm a little tougher than you are how are you going to how are you going to stop me from being a conservative well here's the funny part right a lot of these guys came up with you in the movement didn't they with with Breitbart and all and then they went on this crazy tangent when Trump ran ten years in Matt robe true true I mean those are the veterans so I get like these twenty eight year olds it's trying to school me on how conservatism works and I'm like you know when I was 28 I was leading soldiers I don't need lessons from you in anything much like conservatism you guys have a unblemished track record of failure you've done nothing you've achieved nothing we have a president right now who I didn't support before the during the primaries but he's done more for conservatism than anyone since Ronald Reagan that's indisputable and yet you guys are living in this Jeb Bush fantasy world where we're supposed to go back and just kind of be hardcore during election year go to Washington and do nothing and that's simply not acceptable to to the base of the conservative movement anymore well I got the problem occurred hold it hold that thought though because the base has changed and I think that's what they can't handle right but I do work with the Magda coalition the Mugabe's is energized never drummers what's that face changed I think except to the extent it started demanding performance it demanded accountable for her here's the common denominator John these guys hate accountability I guess the question but hold on this is an important point why is it that all of these guys the Jonah Goldberg's the J Caruso's the Ben how's the all of these guys have four years preached pure conservatism repeal Obamacare tax reform just all of the conservative values second amendment now are so willing to pivot and turn on a dime when Trump says the same things simply because they despise him so they're no longer principal conservatives they're willing to throw all that out because they don't like a guy Ben hell's a friend of Mike he despises Trump Kersal but he doesn't despise the things that are going on in he'll he'll actually admit the conundrum but I don't get right why why does he despised the man has never met Hillary Clinton's on the other side she wants the fundamental to change America for the worse and your you were a cop I was a soldier you don't screw your buddy ever right you never screw your but you never take sides against your but you can go out and you can argue with them and do all these other things but you don't walk over to the enemy you know you wouldn't walk over to a criminal and go yeah you know my partner's kind of a jerk I would walk over to the enemy trench line ago I hate those guys let me tell you where they're hurt that was my problem with certain concerns with that claim to be conservative them were tweeting hashtag I'm with her well libel is liberal narrative that the G the conservative base is racist sexist whatever he buys into the enemy he gets praise from the enemy he keeps doing it can't tolerate that I brought that up I was suppose I said what T is important and you can't be a Blue Falcon you just bothered me are the conservative you know the Conservatives look Glenn Beck as a friend of mine or arguably I have this media career because of Glenn but Glenn back Pence ass and then about a week after he was elected Ben Sasse moved right over to Mitch McConnell and cozied up and Glenn Beck was livid this going back to 2014 Glenn Beck was livid now all of a sudden everything Ben says did is okay cuz Glenn Beck doesn't like Trump the Ben Sasse is forgiven that's what bothers me Trump drove these people so crazy that they abandon all their previous positions all their previous statements and aligned with Hillary Clinton for all intents and purposes because they didn't like one guy that's not pure conservatism to me no remember this is there's a lot of career ISM here there's a lot of envy there's a lot of personal feelings here a lot of these guys thought they had earned positions of power Authority and respect and then these all all these you know these nouveau riche people come in swinging into town who don't need them and don't respect them I mean right do you think if Donald Trump was calling Bill Kristol up saying hey who do i point is you know secretary under secretary Deputy Assistant USDA guide for corn issues do you think Bill Kristol wouldn't be all over him hey he's my against the family again look you exactly you know hence the term Fredo calm but now we've got to kill them off like Michael did Fredo I mean not literally but their careers I believe we need to kill off their careers like Michael did Fredo I don't know if you were there yet I don't know if you're as Extreme as I am no I have to first of all I think we need to insist on a minimum standard of loyalty you do not cavort with together yes all right if you do you're gone and Jeff Flake did I think we need our own conservative code of omerta exactly look you know I got a lot of grief because I said look Lloyd she is important and men don't frickin turn on their buddies okay that's macho posturing and I'm sitting there going have you ever been around men I mean real men not you know male identifying man no they haven't though these are listen I've seen these guys operate at CPAC they're kind of beta marriage they they sort of you wallflowers these are not alphas that go out there and own the room you know so I don't nothing surprising we identify you know I'm a blue state lawyer you know if I if I swung this out the window every house is a couple million bucks I'm not you know I don't want to pretend I'm mister you know steelworker from Pittsburgh like my ancestors uh but I think I have but that's where my affinity is I I get people who live realize thankfully I spent some time in the military so I have a little broader experience a lot of people I spend time around uh and you were a cop out on the streets yeah and different different kinds of but it's a different kind of coming up right it's a dip you cut your teeth in a different way than you do in a newsroom well exactly you know our experience doesn't consist of going to college working in a think tank and then a writer we come to being writers older I mean we have experi done stuff you know Andrew Breitbart came along and then the and then Donald Trump came along after being nice the last time of being nice which is a tea party failed yeah because they crushed it so we bring in Donald Trump because he fights bad and these guys are horrified you can't do that it's not conservative to fight back well you know that's hard to change that's the part that shops be the most right because you take these guys who were conservatives who were shut out of the White House press room for eight years they couldn't get a question if they could even get access in comes a guy who was willing to put them in the first row not like george w bush who left helen thomas in the first row and let her insult and ridicule him he was willing to put them in the first row and they've turned vicious on him before he even got there it almost almost in some weird attempt to placate hillary member would think Jaime Weinstein writing for the Daily Caller when he wanted to negotiate terms of surrender with Hillary Clinton now he's out there promoting himself as a conservative give me a break me a break I have no use for people like that the people for the people for Trump want results are tired of not getting results they're tired of being disrespected and they demand action an action is not what you get or wanted that's not the point the reason they do politics is personal fulfillment personal gain the reason normal people do politics is because politics is broken I gotta fix it then I can go back to the normal things so our our currency is results and an actual action there it is for instance is posturing and cocktail party invitations and cruises you know I heard that bill bill kristol refuses to go on any off ship excursion until you apologize parasail he won't parasail he won't zipline he won't shop in the markets he won't do anything until he gets a personal apology all right let's switch gears you're a Los Angeles County guy right you grew up in the LA area you live in the LA area oh you grew up in Northern California California your whole life your whole adult life if you're gonna get nitpicky now counselor super lawyer all right recent US census data comes out forty four point six percent of Californians don't speak English as the first language at home now there's two first of all I don't know what that's so they may count people who can speak a different way for instance you know I married a Cuban immigrant she speaks Spanish does my house count as a spanish-speaking else even though we never say anything Spanish except burrito I don't know but let's assume it's true then it becomes interesting because like I said I don't see it I live in a blue state but I'm and I'm in the beach cities okay the west west of i-5 I do not see that all the people I see speak English well depends were you it depends where you live right right now your wife is your wife has family in Miami down here in South Florida I lived in Miami for about 11 and a half years then I moved north up to the Fort Lauderdale area in Miami this was noticeable this was everywhere you turn I could walk into Walgreens and have no one no one working there a spoke English up in Fort Lauderdale here it's completely different you're in America it might as well be middle America so it I guess you're right it depends where you live but when I read that Florida the number was about twenty-eight point something percent that's very believable for me because I was exposed to Miami for over a decade so I get your point that if you're not exposed to it it's hard to believe but man I thought Florida was higher actually yeah and again I'm not sure how they're measuring it maybe lingual but there is a huge non-english speaking community here here's a prediction within 10 years California will become the second bilingual state like New Mexico I'm trying it will take 10 years I'm in government away in the California yeah you've got how many state legislators are in California right now it's like 13,000 or something like that right it's it's unreal so let me ask you a question about that though is there any hope any hope whatsoever that California can even get purple or is it blue forever and we've got to resign ourselves but just giving those electoral votes away I think I think for the foreseeable future it's blue you know occasionally a Republican but California's managed to be the goose that laid the golden eggs and commit suicide every choice it faces it makes the wrong one you know it's getting to the point that the only good thing about it is the climate and we're in the middle of a heat wave all right now be remiss last few minutes I had sub Gork on yesterday we spoke about this you're a trial lawyer you understand federal law you're actually all kidding aside a great trial lawyer in in in early in your career history it have you ever seen anything as egregious as Mullah remaining special prosecutor when he was the FBI director that we now know sat on the uranium one investigation for four years the whole thing is mind-boggling to me it is such a transparent conflict of interest on every level and his actions are so clearly biased he sure of recused himself day one highway shouldn't never taken the job it is it's a that's a great point so I beg the question why did he take the job knowing all this because he's a political hack like all of these guys look the law doesn't apply to these guys you know yeah we've seen what's happened with the dossier you know trying to get dirt from other Russians was the worst thing ever possible that could have potentially happened never was and then suddenly it's it's a wonderful thing and a good thing position research was terrible when Don jr. had a five minute meeting that yielded nothing and he walked out of now opposition research is the greatest thing in the world and everybody does it well exactly I just think it's amusing that she lied to everybody lied to her friends and the media made them look like fools and potentially violated some campaign finance laws I didn't care about the oppo right I don't care about the Apple I don't care about going to foreign entities for the oddball right oppo is oppo I care about Hillary sitting his chair of CFIUS Committee on foreign investment in the US when her Family Foundation got a hundred and forty five million and signing off 20% of our uranium to the Russians and I care about the FBI and the DOJ sitting on the investigation then I care about that dossier being used to obtain bogus warrants and wiretaps on Americans the oppo to me is irrelevant yeah exactly you are completely right and all these all these things that were the worst crimes ever or suddenly a okay because as you and I and many others suspected it was all about projecting what Hillary Clinton herself was actually all right last question if today we hang up the phone here when we put off the video white house calls you press the United States as a plane sitting in a Los Angeles Airport for you we need you in the Oval Office he needs three pieces of legal advice from Kirk
