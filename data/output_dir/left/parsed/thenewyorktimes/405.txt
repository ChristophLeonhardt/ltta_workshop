I drove along the straw-colored
cliffs of the Columbia River
before climbing on to dry high
desert plateaus winding,
along wild rivers and passing
through pine forests.
As soon as I saw the Wallowa Valley,
I understood how someone
might get hooked.
It reminded me of the placid
beauty of the Great Plains.
Awed by our surroundings,
my husband, Tim, and I huddled
in blankets by the fireside, then
snuck into the Pendleton wool blankets
that topped each tepee bed
for a night of rest.
The next day was bright and clear. 
The wind from the previous evening
had cleared the smoke and as we 
drove down the rimrock ridge
the air grew warm.
My distaste for heights had kept me from
the Wallowa Lake Tramway, built in 1970.
The 15 minute gondola ride
is near 4,000 foot vertical
descent from the summit of
Mount Howard peaking at 8,150 feet.
For me, the tram was less of a
draw than a dare.
One that I was determined to accept.
