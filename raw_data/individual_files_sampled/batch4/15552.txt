Bill Morneau must go not only did the Minister of Finance personally benefit from selling off shares of mur no Chappell just days before new tax laws came into effect but so too did his father apparently bill senior and the Minister says he has no idea why his dad sold off shares just days prior to that new tax law in fact he said that dad is pretty good at reading newspapers like 36 million other Canadians and he would have known that the Liberals were going to put in new tax laws that were going to raise his taxes but is that really the case or is Bill kind of maybe forgetting something you know like how we forgot to declare that Villa and France of the ethics commissioner all of which is why we're here in the nation's capital to bring the message to the people that Bill Maher know must go and get them to sign our latest rebel media petition asking people if they think that Bill Maher know the finance minister should resign you have any thoughts on that well I think you should resign any particular reason I think there's a several we could point several blunders and I really think that he was a big disappointment and I feel that she should because I don't live here no I Tomer knows I actually think they're regulars off the side rather than fucking oh is that right what do you say them we're awful we know what folks we've been here for more than an hour at the Byward market and we've only had I think three people comment on camera I thought the Bayon King area of Toronto's financial district was bad for Streeters but this takes the cake but it's kind of dawning on me the reason why I mean I'm betting that most of the people here are government employees you don't want to be on camera I guess dissing the finance minister do you so I apologize for the lack of feedback we're getting and the amount of no comment and sergeant Schultz like I know nothing I saw nothing well that wraps up our fabulous Ottawa caper and two things come to mind first of all folks we couldn't have done this without you that Jumbotron equipped truck cost about two thousand dollars all expenses in and without your generosity we simply couldn't have pulled this off and secondly let's hope the finance minister listens to what you have to say namely that he does the right thing and steps down enough is enough and Bill Morneau must go for the rebel dot media I am David the men's oil Benzies
