1
00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:04,582
SHOWED UP TOTAL.

2
00:00:04,582 --> 00:00:10,321
AND WE RECOMMEND THAT.

3
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:12,190
FOR SIX YEARS, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,894
JULIAN ASSANGE HAS LIVED IN THE

5
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:18,897
ECUADORIAN AREA, BUT SINCE 2016

6
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:21,766
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM.

7
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:23,334
HE HAS A LOT OF ENEMIES OF

8
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:25,070
COURSE BUT ALSO FRIENDS AND ONE

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,173
OF HIS CLOSEST IS ACTRESS AND

10
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:29,774
MODEL PAMELA ANDERSON.

11
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:30,542
SHE HAS CALLED IT JULIAN ASSANGE

12
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,945
A HERO AND SAID SHE FEARS FOR

13
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,080
HIS SAFETY.

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,415
PAMELA ANDERSON JOINS US TONIGHT

15
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:38,083
PAMELA ANDERSON JOINS US TONIGH

16
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,351
TONIGHT.

17
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:41,953
>> HOW ARE YOU?

18
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:43,755
>> Tucker: GOOD, THANKS.

19
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:45,757
HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

20
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:48,960
>> I MET HIM THROUGH VIVIAN

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,327
WESTWOOD.

22
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:50,695
SHE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE

23
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:52,330
AND A SUPPORTER OF HIS AND SHE

24
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,398
KNEW I WOULD LOVE HIS CAUSE AND

25
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:55,533
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I

26
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:55,934
MET HIM.

27
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,569
AND WE GET ALONG GREAT.

28
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,270
I SEE HIM A LOT, I'VE KNOWN HIM

29
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,972
FOR MANY YEARS NOW.

30
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:02,207
HE HAS A GREAT TESTAMENT TO THE

31
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:03,341
HUMAN SPIRIT TO BE IN THE

32
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:07,645
SITUATION THAT HE'S IN AND TO

33
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:08,780
HAVE THE FIGHT THAT HE HAS IN

34
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,815
HIM, AND     AND A SENSE OF HUMR

35
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:12,984
HIM, AND     AND A SENSE OF HUM.

36
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:14,352
HE IS REALLY AN INCREDIBLE

37
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:14,686
PERSON.

38
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:16,521
>> Tucker: IT SO IT RAISES THE

39
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:18,356
INTERESTING QUESTION, WHY HAS HE

40
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:19,124
RECEIVED ALMOST NO SUPPORT FROM

41
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:22,927
THE ENTERTAINMENT WORLD IN

42
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:23,728
HOLLYWOOD, FOR EXAMPLE?

43
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,165
>> WHILE I THINK THOSE ARE BIG

44
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:28,533
SUPPORTERS AND PEOPLE HAVE

45
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,267
MISUNDERSTOOD IT, HIS INTENTION

46
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:34,772
WAS NOT TO GET TRUMP ELECTED, IT

47
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:35,840
WAS TO GIVE TRUE INFORMATION SO

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,875
PEOPLE COULD MAKE EDUCATED

49
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:37,842
DECISIONS ABOUT THE PEOPLE THEY

50
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:40,178
WANTED TO VOTE FOR.

51
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:42,147
SO PEOPLE WANT TO BLAME

52
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:43,948
SOMEBODY, SO THEY BLAME HIM.

53
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:44,315
YES.

54
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:47,018
I GET LOTS OF FLAK FOR THAT TOO

55
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:48,319
WHEN I'M IN HOLLYWOOD.

56
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,888
>> Tucker: SO THE IDEA IS IF

57
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:52,557
YOU SUPPORT JULIAN ASSANGE YOU

58
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:54,259
ARE SOMEHOW AGAINST

59
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:54,726
HILLARY CLINTON?

60
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:56,461
>> IN SOME CASES.

61
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,364
>> Tucker: YOU ALSO KNOW

62
00:01:59,364 --> 00:01:59,831
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

63
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:03,334
REMARKABLY, IMPRESSIVELY.

64
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,936
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

65
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,171
ALLEGATION THAT THEY WERE

66
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,740
WORKING TOGETHER TO EXPOSE

67
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,240
HILLARY'S EMAILS?

68
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,109
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

69
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:12,343
EVERYONE LIKES TO BLAME RUSSIA

70
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:13,811
WHEN ANYTHING GOES WRONG IN

71
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:16,014
AMERICA AND I HAVE SPOKEN AT THE

72
00:02:16,014 --> 00:02:17,382
KREMLIN MANY TIMES AND THE LAST

73
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:19,551
TIME I WAS THERE THERE WAS

74
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:20,084
SOMETHING HAPPENING.

75
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:21,352
THE FIRST THING THEY SAY TO ME

76
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:24,055
IS, SO WHAT HAVE WE DONE WRONG

77
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,190
THIS TIME?

78
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,758
IT'S A COMMON JOKE.

79
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:28,960
AMERICA LIKES TO BLAME THEM FOR

80
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,595
EVERYTHING.

81
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,296
I WAS WITH JULIAN BEFORE THE

82
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,097
ELECTION AND HE HAD NO IDEA, HE

83
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:34,933
REALLY DID NOT THINK THAT TRUMP

84
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,335
WAS GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION.

85
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:40,572
BUT, IT TURNED OUT THE WAY THE

86
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:40,872
DATA.

87
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:42,273
>> Tucker: SO YOU ARE SPEAKING

88
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:44,742
AT THE KREMLIN, YOU'RE HANGING

89
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:46,144
WITH JULIAN ASSANGE AT THE

90
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,145
ECUADORIAN EMBASSY IN LONDON.

91
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:49,314
DID YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF, HOW

92
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:50,181
DID I GET HERE?

93
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:54,519
THIS IS THE LIFE PATH THAT YOU

94
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:54,886
PLANNED?

95
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:55,220
[LAUGHS]

96
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,955
>> Pamela: WELL I'M AN ANIMAL

97
00:02:56,955 --> 00:03:00,692
ACTIVIST, I SPOKE ABOUT THE

98
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:01,659
ENVIRONMENT, I SPOKE ABOUT THE

99
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,194
ECONOMY AND THEY INVITED ME TO

100
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:05,129
THE KREMLIN, THEY LOVE THE WAY I

101
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:06,164
WAS SPEAKING.

102
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:08,199
I TOUCHED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I

103
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,569
WANTED TO CONTINUE MY WORK IN

104
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,171
RUSSIA.

105
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:14,672
THAT WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE.

106
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:17,575
I AM ON THE COUNCIL OF THE

107
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:20,578
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF

108
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:25,350
ANIMAL WELFARE.

109
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,352
SO IT IS JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT

110
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:31,155
I KNOW ALL THESE CRAZY WILD,

111
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,123
INTELLIGENT AND INTERESTING

112
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:32,557
PEOPLE.

113
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:33,691
>> Tucker: I KNOW YOU LIVE IN

114
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,360
FRANCE NOW, BUT I THINK YOU HAVE

115
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,363
A HOME IN L.A., MALIBU.

116
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,365
WHEN YOU GO BACK THERE, AND YOU

117
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:42,767
SAY, I WAS JUST OVER AT THE

118
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,269
KREMLIN TALKING TO

119
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:45,303
VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHAT KIND OF

120
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:46,638
RESPONSE OR YOU GET?

121
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:47,405
>> Pamela: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

122
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:49,340
HAPPY ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE'S MADE

123
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,209
A LOT OF GREAT IMPROVEMENTS.

124
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,677
IN MY SITUATION I WANTED HIM TO

125
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:53,978
STOP PORTING STEEL PRODUCTS TO

126
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:55,413
RUSSIA AND THAT PRETTY MUCH

127
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,814
STOPPED THE SEAL HUNT IN CANADA,

128
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:59,017
WHICH WAS MY WAS MY GOAL

129
00:03:59,017 --> 00:03:59,951
INITIALLY.

130
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,553
WE ALSO WANTED TO TALK ABOUT

131
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,122
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, AND

132
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:05,123
ANIMALS IN CAPTIVITY, CAPTURING

133
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:08,126
DOLPHINS AND WHALES AND NOT

134
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:11,529
SELLING THEM TO CHINA.

135
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:12,964
AND ENDANGERED SPECIES.

136
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,332
I'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH THE

137
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:15,066
MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND

138
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:17,067
PEOPLE LIKE THAT AND OF COURSE,

139
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,970
THERE'S A LOT OF CROSSOVER

140
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,738
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF CAUSES I

141
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:21,539
BELIEVE IN.

142
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,543
I BELIEVE IN JUSTICE FOR ALL,

143
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:26,344
AND JULIAN ASSANGE IS AN

144
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:27,145
INCREDIBLE PERSON.

145
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:28,746
IF YOU READ ANYTHING HIS MOTHER

146
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,748
SAYS ABOUT HIM, WHICH IS AN

147
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:31,949
INTERESTING SOURCE TO GO TO A

148
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,351
COMPANY'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS

149
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:34,752
SINCE HE WAS A CHILD.

150
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:35,453
HE'S BEEN WORRIED ABOUT DOING

151
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,488
THE RIGHT THING AND I THINK IS

152
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:40,058
VERY BRAVE, AND HE ISN'T REALLY

153
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:42,026
IN DEEP TROUBLE, I THINK, FOR

154
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:43,995
HIS HEALTH.

155
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,698
HE'S NEVER BEEN IN THE SUNLIGHT,

156
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:47,131
FOR SIX YEARS.

157
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:48,533
THAT'S ALREADY HARMFUL.

158
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,135
NOW HE'S BEEN CUT OFF, NO

159
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:52,737
INTERNET, NO PHONE CALLS AND NO

160
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:54,572
VISITORS.

161
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,140
ONE OF HIS ONLY CHOICE IS PRETTY

162
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,408
SOON WILL PROBABLY BE TO LEAVE

163
00:04:57,408 --> 00:04:59,377
THE EMBASSY, AND HE WILL BE

164
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:02,513
ARRESTED AND THEN DEPORTED TO

165
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:04,315
AMERICA, WHICH I DON'T THINK

166
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:06,784
WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR HIM.

167
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,753
>> Tucker: I DON'T KNOW WHAT I

168
00:05:08,753 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK OF ANYTHING OF THIS BUT I
