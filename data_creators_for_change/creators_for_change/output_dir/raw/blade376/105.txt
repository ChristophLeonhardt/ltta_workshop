00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I was just about to go get</font>

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">an early night's sleep having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,150
finished my UK lecture tour realizing

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,890
empathize which went very well by the

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,510
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you missed out on it don't worry</font>

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,660
because I'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding many more dates</font>

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,059
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the not-too-distant future and I was</font>

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,740
made aware of an article<font color="#E5E5E5"> about saying</font>

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,289
that recently happened in Afghanistan a

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,920
US soldier killed 16 Afghan civilians

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,500
including nine children and three<font color="#E5E5E5"> women</font>

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,140
although for me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just human life and</font>

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,510
regardless of what their age maybe um

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,480
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a question I wanted</font>

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">to post the US government now I</font>

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,950
appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not likely to see</font>

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,870
this and even if they did they probably

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,320
aren't going to respond to me because

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,620
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a journalist I'm not in the</font>

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,780
Pentagon or wherever they're going to be

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">holding their conferences but my</font>

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,360
question is this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> soldier that</font>

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,449
killed these 16 civilians technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

24
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,960
terrorist um based on the definition

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,309
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have of a terrorist US</font>

26
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,500
government and my follow-up question to

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,580
that is if you based on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,860
definition of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrorist and claim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,080
this soldier was in fact a terrorist

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,970
does that give the Afghan people the

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,720
moral<font color="#CCCCCC"> right to attack the country from</font>

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">which this terrorist was trained and</font>

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,570
some people may<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight away jump on</font>

34
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,409
and say well this was just 16 people you

35
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,840
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta think about if 16 people were</font>

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,070
killed by occupying forces in America

37
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,720
what would the response be and so those

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,450
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just my two main questions I look</font>

39
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,640
forward to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> responses from anyone</font>

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,880
from anywhere all over the world have a

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:00:00,000
good night
