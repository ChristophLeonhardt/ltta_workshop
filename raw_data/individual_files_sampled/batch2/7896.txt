Supreme Court is in the middle right now of another opportunity to finally do something about gerrymandering it's a topic that they have been very hesitant to engage in or to make any sort of big change and maybe this is an opportunity for that to change as well so today they actually heard arguments in relation to a gerrymandering case coming out of Maryland and in this case it was actually the Democratic Party that gerrymander to district to try to evict one Republican representative and they did it in such a blatant fashion that pretty much everyone agrees that it was for a political purpose and it went obviously too far even for the notoriously moderate to conservative in terms of actions Supreme Court so let's talk about this case michael b kimberly a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the Maryland case argue that democratic state lawmakers there had redrawn a district in North Western Maryland to retaliate against citizens who supported its longtime incumbent representative roscoe Bartlett that's a name for you a Republican that retaliation he said violated the First Amendment by diluting their voting power in a district that had been controlled by Republicans and I think Michael B Kimberly is 100% right there and so I look forward to him agreeing with the need to do away with all jerk meandering across the country might not be the case here's an idea of how bad the gerrymandering was mr. Bartlett had one is 2010 race by a margin of 28 percentage points in 2012 he lost by 21 points that is a massive swing that's pre 92018 waves and all that you don't get a 40 point swing over two years in a congressional race unless you do what they did which is take something like a third of a million people out of his district and replaced them with Democrats so everybody acknowledges this is bad and so far the judges seem to think something maybe should be done we're not entirely sure justice Elena Kagan said that in some cases it might be hard to tell when politics played too large a role but she said that this was not a problem here however much you think is too much this case is too much Chief Justice Roberts criticized the challenged districts odd shape saying it doesn't seem to have any internal logic which again is an argument that can be applied to any number of congressional districts that have gone through this process of partisan gerrymandering and justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said there was a little reason for the court to rule now because this decision would come too late to affect the 2018 elections which is perhaps an excuse for stalling but not an excuse for lack of inaction in the long term what do you think about this weed you know it's funny michael schorr and i talked about this on plug my podcast the edge with Mark Thompson we do a little political thing up front and we talk about this partisan gerrymandering because there doesn't seem to be any sort of neutrality to it anywhere it's very hard to find how these districts can be redrawn with utter neutrality and so when it goes our way we're happy when it goes against us we're not yeah it's all about gerrymandering and that's where the shoes gonna pinch for us as we try to retake power I'm talking about progressives because the lines are being drawn by the dominant party often and and so that's why even as we feel sort of this wave of optimism about the midterms it's against a backdrop of increasing gerrymandering that could go against us yeah yeah so I'm I'm torn because you know in the case of Maryland obviously the gerrymandering seems to be done by the Democrats as opposed to Republicans and I want to be fair right and I don't like gerrymandering I don't like any political party drawing districts in a way that gives them an advantage an unfair advantage but then there's the side of me that's tired of playing fair because you see Republicans get away with murder while Democrats try to you know play patty cakes and we have you know if you look at the whole picture and you look at all of these congressional races and how gerrymandering has disproportionately had given Republicans the advantage it's frustrating right but again I mean look if I look at it you know in a moral perspective in an ethical perspective about a better word gerrymandering should not be done in a way to give any political party the advantage it's just you know the the shady side of me wants to give Democrats a pass but I'm not going to well the good thing here is that if the Supreme Court were to establish some sort of standard it would probably apply across the board so what we don't want is for individual states probably the blue states to be responsible about this while the red states continue to gerrymander the Hellas kind of whatever exactly but but I believe that if you were to set some sort of standard it would apply across the board and and acknowledge if you go read ten articles about this case today everyone the subject of it is it's really hard to figure out exactly what's fair and what's not fair and that's totally true but this is also one of the areas worked all too often Americans and even people in the media and perhaps people in the Supreme Court as well forget that we have thousands of people in academia studying these topics as their whole career not as something where I come out and I talk about it every once in a while it's all that they do and there are all sorts of ways that you can run numbers on States districts and figure out how far diverges from what should be a fair representation of the overall percentage of the vote that a party gets in a state and you can rank States by that and even under those maps you will never have anything that perfectly represents if you get fifty percent of the vote you get fifty percent of the seats it can't happen we don't have enough seats to actually do that but you can't improve on it that's what happened earlier this year with Pennsylvania now Pennsylvania GOP had gerrymandered in such a fashion that the map wildly benefited them the Supreme Court said you need to modify that they came up with a new map it is still biased towards the Republicans they will get more seats than they deserve based on the vote but it's much fairer that's the sort of thing that we should be aiming for not a perfect representation of the popular will across districts but something that is closer to fair and I think the Supreme Court could do something like that and if necessary iterate on it in the future it's funny we've drifted so far off course that like what John's talking about sounds reasonably appealing you know even though it leans to the right it's like alright I'll take it because it is better than what in some cases I think it would it would go the opposite way it would slightly benefit over benefit the the Democrats it's gonna it's gonna happen on a state-by-state basis there's different ways to do it but I think we need movement I do like I do like that I've come across as reasonably appealing in this particular case that's not appealing in the least yeah Wow that's the harsh way to end a clip we could have ended it out I have a feeling they won't but anyway very important still ongoing as I said the arguments are being heard literally this week so we will check in every once in a while and see if there's gonna be some actual movement on it you just watch the video by the Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash
