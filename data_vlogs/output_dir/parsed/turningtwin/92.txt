hey guys I'm Damien I'm 10 and we are
the Rybka twins welcome back to our
channel in this week's video we are
going to show you guys how to do a bent
back or a back fit or brick whatever you
want to call it but before we do that be
sure to subscribe if you haven't already
and give it a big thumbs up if you like
it now don't get discouraged or move
down if you can't get a straight away
because these things take time and it's
a person and just seeing all the advance
people they have to practice to get to
where they are now yeah you don't get it
straight away
Julie looking kidnapping ever it has to
start somewhere we're going to warm up
our wrists shoulders back and legs and
activate so we're ready to do our back
there yeah
with that one make sure your angles as
we see in the end you're now going to
warm up our shoulders
okay so we start off you bring both feet
in close to your bottom arm up you bent
the back place your fingertips
and then push out Tommy towards silver
and Edgar's underneath low heat
now a lot of people think that they
can't do a band back because of their
backside severely but as it is often to
do the shoulders that they are too stiff
so to loosen up your shoulders we can do
it be up in your bed back and then
you're going to crawl in ten
beautiful back as far as you can and
when you think you're breaking limit
just try and hold it there for a count
of eight if you're feeling really up to
the challenge then try and crawl in and
put your head up toward your bottom and
the more times you do that each day or
each week you will see your improvement
of your back flexibility and your
shoulder flexibility
okay so when you do your bend back it's
important that you stretch your arms as
much as you can any of you focus before
also heals must be down and then she
looks great now that you've mastered
their technique with the been back from
the floor you can start doing a room
so first do it someone spotted you just
the secretary so then unlock and someone
can you stand in front of you like this
and hold the shoulders he tell them to
put the head back breath is that's
reversing that goes back he child
towards you and then like slow them as
the girl
I'm sure they're doing it correctly head
up to their bottom pins flat so it comes
to coming up with their back you need to
wait over your toes push forward and
then slowly come up legs will slowly
straighten arms by the ears and head is
the last thing to come up everybody just
like that
now if you don't have someone to spot
you then you can use a ball
so if you want to try your femme back
from standing and you don't have anyone
to help you or you're too scared
so it's really important to get your
band back enough because it's the base
for like all the tricks in acrobats and
peanuts once you've got your band back
you can try out all sorts of tricks can
I give them back for three interestingly
