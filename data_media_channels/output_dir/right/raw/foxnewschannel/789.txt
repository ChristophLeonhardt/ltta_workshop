EVERY TIME WE TALKED, WHICH

00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:52,577
WE STARTED WITH THE

WAS A CLOSE SECOND.

43
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,963
>> SENATOR MCCONNELL, IN

POLARITY IN THIS COUNTRY HAS

48
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:20,839
INCREASED TO A DEGREE WHERE

49
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:22,507
IT HAS REALLY SEEN A LOT OF

50
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:24,643
ANGER IN TERMS OF PEOPLE,

51
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:26,211
YOU KNOW, TALKING ACROSS THE

52
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,813
AISLE OR THE FENCE AT EACH

53
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:28,146
OTHER.

54
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:30,282
CHARLES WAS A CONSERVATIVE

55
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:33,385
COMMUNE TERRITORY AND

56
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:33,418

COMMENTATOR AND COLND

63
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:34,386
COMMENTATOR AND COLUMNIST

64
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,487
HAD THE ABILITY TO CROSS

65
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:36,688
OVER BOTH SIDES EVEN IF YOU

66
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:38,557
DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM YOU

67
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,591
RESPECTED HIS OPINION.

68
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:41,026
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HIM THAT

69
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:43,395
ALLOWED HIM THAT?

70
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,497
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, HIS

71
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:46,998
INTELLECT WOWED YOU.

72
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,100
I THINK ANYBODY WHO WAS

73
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,302
AROUND CHARLES KNEW IT WAS

74
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:51,336
NOT A GOOD IDEA TO BE

75
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:52,237
SCREAMING BECAUSE HE WAS

76
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,907
GOING TO HANDLE HIMSELF IN A

77
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,543
CLASSY WAY RESPECTFUL

78
00:01:58,543 --> 00:01:58,910
DISCOURSE.

79
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,612
IT WAS A GOOD OBJECT LESSON

80
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:01,880
FOR ALL OF US IN POLITICS

81
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,215
WHO HAVE A TENDENCY FROM

82
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:08,019
TIME TO TIME TO RAISE OUR

83
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:09,020
VOICES.

84
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,856
>> WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIM THAT

85
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:12,090
YOU WILL REMEMBER THE MOST?

86
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,325
WHAT WILL YOU HOLD WITH YOU

87
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:15,460
ABOUT CHARLES?

88
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,829
>> WELL, OVERCOMING SUCH

89
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,698
ADVERSITY AND LEADING SUCH A

90
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:21,299
CONSEQUENTIAL LIFE IS AN

91
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,567
INSPIRATION TO ALL OF US.

92
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,936
I MEAN, MOST OF US HAVE SET

93
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,438
BACKS OF ONE KIND OR

94
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:26,771
ANOTHER.

95
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,974
BUT NOTHING COMING CLOSE TO

96
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,108
APPROACHING WHAT HE HAD TO

97
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,576
DEAL WITH THROUGHOUT HIS

98
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:32,010
LIFE.

99
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,681
AND TO BECOME REALLY THE

100
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:38,850
INTELLECTUAL LEADER OF

101
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,985
THOUGHT RIGHT OF CENTER FOR

102
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:42,187
ALL THESE YEARS IS

103
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:45,557
ASTONISHING ACCOMPLISHMENT.

104
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:46,958
>> IT CERTAINLY IS HE WILL

105
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,260
BE REMEMBERED BY ALL OF US

106
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,961
FOR BEING ABLE TO OVERCOME

107
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,429
SUCH ADVERSITY AND TO

108
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:52,898
MAINTAIN SUCH A GOOD SENSE

109
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:54,132
OF HUMOR AS WELL.

110
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,634
THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT

111
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,935
BOTH BRIT HUME AND BRET

112
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,370
BAIER TALKED ABOUT.

113
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,804
DO YOU RECALL HIS SENSE OF

114
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,105
HUMOR?

115
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:07,812
>> OH, HE WAS FUN.

116
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,947
NOTHING BETTER THAN A

117
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:09,614
CONVERSATION WITH CHARLES

118
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:10,048
KRAUTHAMMER.

119
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,349
HE KNEW SO MUCH MORE THAN

120
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:12,817
THE REST OF US.

121
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,852
YOUR FIRST REACTION I'M

122
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:14,819
AFRAID I'M GOING TO SAY

123
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,453
SOMETHING STUPID.

124
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:16,555
EVEN IF YOU HAD, HE WOULDN'T

125
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:17,856
HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT

126
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:20,158
HE WAS A LOVELY MAN IN EVERY

127
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,092
SINGLE MEASURABLE WAY.

128
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:23,562
WHAT A LIFE OF CONSEQUENCE.

129
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:24,896
>> SENATOR MCCONNELL, THANK

130
00:03:24,896 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO
