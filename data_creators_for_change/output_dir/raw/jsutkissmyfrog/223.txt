72
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,250
one in case he hasn't remembered so yeah

73
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,650

230
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,490
beginning of a discussion for me when I

231
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,230
even without them seeing the book that

232
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,420
could be half hour chatting with

233
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,040
somebody easily it's been recommended by

234
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,290
jonathan safran foer by nathan englander

235
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,690

<font color="#E5E5E5">to like this book we're gonna be friends</font>

238
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,100
I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> include this in the hall</font>

239
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,800
because i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is relevant and awesome</font>

240
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,630
as the other thing my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom made me a</font>

241
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,570
cookery book and it's got like plastic

242
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,179
kind of wallets in it and she's had

243
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,090
little clip art things for every recipe

244
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,370
and they are like family recipes fig

245
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,460
pies and and other other stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

246
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,520
has permeated the family table so that's

247
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome because I don't cook and this</font>

248
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,490

252
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,490
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all agree and i finally</font>

253
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,270
bought something that I genuinely don't

254
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,220
own because I thought I just own

255
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,630
automatically for thought they might

256
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,370
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been like Greek green glow around</font>

257

260
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,190
