1
00:00:01,326 --> 00:00:03,361
D.C. SEWER SWAMP OPENING

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:07,432
MONOLOGUE.

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:08,567
THE ONE WE WILL GO THROUGH ALL

4
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,368
OF THIS VERY, VERY SLOWLY AND

5
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:11,069
PRECISELY, LOTS OF GROUND TO

6
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:13,872
COVER, WITH EVEN BREAKING NEWS

7
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:15,774
ON THE LAST 2 MINUTES.

8
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:16,708
TOMORROW MORNING WE WILL FINALLY

9
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,843
GET A CHANCE TO WITNESS ONE OF

10
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:21,847
THE MOST IMPORTANT HEARINGS IN

11
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:22,447
HISTORY OF SUPREME COURT

12
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:22,848
NOMINATIONS.

13
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:25,350
AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES, THE

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,889
36-YEAR-OLD ALLEGATION SHOULD BE

15
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:33,825
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

16
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,826
AND IT HAS BEEN BY REPUBLICANS

17
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,794
AND THE PRESIDENT.

18
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:37,028
AT 10:00 A.M. AND OPEN HEARINGS

19
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:38,496
THEY WILL LAY IT ALL ON THE

20
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,231
TABLE AND IN THE U.S. SENATE

21
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:42,033
THEY WILL MAKE AN INFORMED

22
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,835
DECISION ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

23
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,103
REMEMBER, THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL

24
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:48,373
ROLE IS ADVICE AND CONSENT.

25
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:49,274
OF COURSE, THAT'S VERY

26
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:49,641
IMPORTANT.

27
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:52,177
40 YEARS OF ONE'S LIFE IS VERY

28
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:52,544
IMPORTANT.

29
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:53,511
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN IN THE

30
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,213
PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT FOR ALL THESE

31
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,848
DECADES AND BECAUSE OF HIS WORK

32
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:01,853
HE IS LITERALLY FACED AND PASSED

33
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,621
SIX DEEP BACKGROUND FBI CHECKS.

34
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:05,957
THOSE THAT KNOW KAVANAUGH THE

35
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,492
BEST, I SCHOOL FRIENDS IN

36
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:08,694
COLLEGE FRIENDS, THOSE THAT WENT

37
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,997
TO LAW SCHOOL, GIRLFRIENDS,

38
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:12,731
COLLEAGUES, FELLOW JUDGES AND

39
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:15,267
CLERKS, THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

40
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:18,303
ALL WORKED WITH HIM, WAS THE

41
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:20,606
COACH WITH BASKETBALL IN OTHER

42
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:22,474
SPORTS, DEMOCRATS AND

43
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:23,141
REPUBLICANS, I HAVE PRAISED

44
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:25,811
KAVANAUGH FOR HIS CHARACTER,

45
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:26,545
JUDGMENT AND FRIENDSHIP AND WHO

46
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:30,549
HE IS.

47
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,386
THROUGHOUT UNTIL 12 DAYS AGO,

48
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,053
ANY ALLEGATION OF ANY

49
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:35,654
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT EVER.

50
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:38,423
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS HAD ONE OF

51
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:39,358
THE MOST EXTENSIVE TRACK RECORDS

52
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:42,628
OF ANY FEDERAL JUDGE AND HE

53
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:43,829
WORKED ONE OF THE MOST HIGHEST

54
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:44,830
PROFILE FEDERAL COURTS.

55
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,432
HE'S BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND WE

56
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:49,401
ALSO KNOW THAT PROFESSOR FORD

57
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,603
AND HER GROPING ALLEGATIONS

58
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:51,704
AGAINST HIM HAVE A LOT OF

59
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:52,605
ISSUES.

60
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:54,340
WE WILL GO STEP-BY-STEP THROUGH

61
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,608
EVERY ALLEGATION TONIGHT.

62
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,242
THESE CHARGES WERE MADE TO

63
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,611
CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS, AND

64
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,145
WHILE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, NOT

65
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:02,648
AN INDEPENDENT LAW ENFORCEMENT

66
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:02,982
AGENCY.

67
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:04,617
BY THE WAY, THE CLAIM DATES BACK

68
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:06,952
TO WHEN FORD AND KAVANAUGH WERE

69
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:09,455
IN HIGH SCHOOL 36 YEARS AGO AND

70
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,757
FORD CANNOT REMEMBER A DATE OR

71
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:12,358
LOCATION OF THE ALLEGED

72
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:16,228
INCIDENT.

73
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:18,597
AND THE FOUR WITNESSES THAT FORD

74
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,399
LISTED TO CORROBORATE HER

75
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,801
CLAIMS, ALL OF THEM DENY WHAT

76
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,937
SHE IS ALLEGING AND PROFESSOR

77
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,472
FORD HAS REPRESENTED BY AN

78
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:28,107
ATTORNEY WHO POINTED OUT ON THIS

79
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,808
SHOW IS A LEFT-WING ACTIVIST WHO

80
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,911
ONCE VOWED TO RESIST

81
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,646
DONALD TRUMP AT EVERY LEVEL AND

82
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:38,584
HIS INCONSISTENT ON IMPORTANT

83
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:39,051
ISSUES INVOLVING

84
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:39,652
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE

85
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:40,019
WORKPLACE.

86
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:42,421
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE PAULA JONES

87
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,222
OBVIOUSLY, SHE DEFENDED

88
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,623
AL FRANKEN.

89
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,658
DESPITE ALL OF THESE WARNING

90
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,595
SIGNS, IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT

91
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:50,696
PROFESSOR FORD AND JUDGE

92
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:56,002
KAVANAUGH SPEAK UNDER OATH.

93
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,803
THE PRESIDENT WOULD MAKE EVERY

94
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:58,638
ACCOMMODATION POSSIBLE AND

95
00:02:58,638 --> 00:02:59,839
TONIGHT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING THE

96
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:00,606
EXACT OPPOSITE.

97
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:01,274
THEY HAVE ALREADY CONVICTED

98
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:06,413
JUDGE KAVANAUGH BEFORE EVEN

99
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:07,213
HEARING FROM HIM.

100
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:14,421
OR PROFESSOR FORD.

101
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,523
AND RUSHING TO JUDGMENT AGAINST

102
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:18,325
TWO UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS

103
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:20,393
AGAINST KAVANAUGH, ALLEGATIONS

104
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:21,227
THAT ARE SO SALACIOUS WILL

105
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:22,662
LITERALLY TONIGHT MAKE YOUR HEAD

106
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:23,029
SPIN.

107
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:25,098
THE SECOND PLANE THAT CAME OUT

108
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:25,832
IN THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE WAS

109
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,669
SO OUTRAGEOUS AND SO

110
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,037
UNSUBSTANTIATED THAT EVEN THE

111
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,272
CHILD HATING "NEW YORK TIMES"

112
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:33,807
REFUSED TO OFFICIALLY REPORT ON

113
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:34,207
IT.

114
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:36,710
IN THIS CASE, A WOMAN NAMED

115
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,744
DEBORAH RAMIREZ.

116
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:40,213
SHE ALLEGES THAT IN THE 1980s,

117
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:40,880
KAVANAUGH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED

118
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,817
HIMSELF TO HER AT A DRUNKEN

119
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:44,451
COLLEGE PARTY.

120
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:45,986
RAMIREZ HERSELF WASN'T TOTALLY

121
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:48,421
SURE IF IT WAS KAVANAUGH, IF HE

122
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:49,422
WAS THE PERPETRATOR.

123
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:50,690
ACCORDING TO HER OWN WORDS IN

124
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,360
HER OWN ACCOUNT SHE BECAME"

125
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,894
QUICKLY INEBRIATED" AT THE

126
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:55,195
PARTY.

127
00:03:55,195 --> 00:04:00,000
SHE WAS "FOGGY AND SLURRING HER

128
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,835
WORDS" AND RAMIREZ EVEN

129
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:03,370
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SHE HAD

130
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,070
SIGNIFICANT MEMORY GAPS FROM

131
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,307
THAT EVENING.

132
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:08,074
THOSE RAMIREZ LISTED IN HER CASE

133
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:12,412
TO THE INCIDENT HAVE ALL FLAT

134
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:13,980
FLATLY DENIED HER CHARGE

135
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,649
INCLUDING HER OWN BEST FRIENDS.

136
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,416
NOT A SINGLE PERSON CORROBORATE

137
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,618
HER STORY, NOT ONE.

138
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:21,454
MOMENTS AGO WE LEARNED THERE IS

139
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:22,622
ANOTHER ACCUSER MAKING AN

140
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:23,390
ANONYMOUS HEARSAY CLAIM ABOUT AN

141
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,525
INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN

142
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:28,695
KAVANAUGH AND A WOMAN IN 1998

143
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:30,830
AND THIS ANONYMOUS NBC NEWS

144
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,432
REPORT IS OBVIOUSLY A REPORT

145
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:34,334
THAT I DOUBT NBC NEWS WOULD EVER

146
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:39,139
MAKE ABOUT TOM BROKAW OR MATT

147
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,640
LAUER OR AND HE LACKED.

148
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,808
THEY WOULDN'T DO IT ABOUT PEOPLE

149
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,510
THAT THEY'VE WORKED WITH OR HAVE

150
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,445
WORKED WITH OVER THE YEARS.

151
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:47,647
SO THE QUESTION IS, I WAS JUDGE

152
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:48,448
KAVANAUGH SUPPOSED TO DEFEND

153
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:51,651
HIMSELF NOW FROM AN ANONYMOUS

154
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:52,519
ACCUSER AT THE 11TH HOUR?

155
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,287
WHICH NOW BRINGS US TO THE

156
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,121
SINGLE MOST SICKENING ALLEGATION

157
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:59,426
THAT THE LEFT WANTS YOU TO

158
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:00,593
BELIEVE AS ABSOLUTE FACT.

159
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,929
IT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE PUBLIC

160
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:06,032
DOMAIN BY -- YOU KNOW HIM, HE'S

161
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,834
ON FAKE NEWS CNN EVERY HOUR ON

162
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,402
THE HOUR AND IF HE IS NOT THERE

163
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:13,039
HE'S OVER ON CONSPIRACY TV AND

164
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:13,840
NBC.

165
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,642
MICHAEL AVENATTI, THE BOMBASTIC,

166
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:16,443
UNTRUSTWORTHY AND FAME SEEKING

167
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:18,044
ATTORNEY WHO MADE IT HIS LIFE'S

168
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,246
MISSION TO RESIST AND HATE

169
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:21,848
DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS FINE.

170
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:23,683
HIS CLIENT IN THIS CASE IS A

171
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,451
WOMAN NAMED JULIE SWETNICK.

172
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:27,154
AT THIS LATE HOUR SHE IS

173
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:30,490
ALLEGING THAT BETWEEN 1981 AND

174
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,626
1983, SHE ATTENDED AT LEAST TEN

175
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:33,326
PARTIES, WHERE SHE CLAIMS THAT

176
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:38,131
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HIS FRIEND

177
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,700
MARK JUDGE ROUTINELY DRUG TO

178
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,035
FEMALE PARTYGOERS.

179
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:43,437
THIS HAPPENED REGULARLY, ALMOST

180
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:45,639
ON A WEEKEND BASIS.

181
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,441
AND EVEN IN THE SUMMER.

182
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,242
AND IT WAS AN ORGANIZED SCHEME

183
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,644
TO EITHER GIVE THEM GRAIN

184
00:05:50,644 --> 00:06:01,755
ALCOHOL OR DRUGS, TO GANG OR

185
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:02,422
TRAIN RAPED THESE VICTIMS.

186
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:06,193
SHE ALSO CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN

187
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:10,230
PART OF ONE OF THOSE GANG RAPES.

188
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,668
SHE'S SAYING THAT THEY WOULD

189
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:20,774
ATTEND PARTIES AND YOUNG GIRLS

190
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:24,411
WERE DRUGGED AND.

191
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,212
NOR DID ANYONE ELSE THAT EVER

192
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:27,214
WENT TO ANY OF THESE PARTIES,

193
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:30,851
NOT A SINGLE PARTY.

194
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:32,018
NO SPECIFIC DATES WERE GIVEN AND

195
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,854
NO NAMES WERE GIVEN OTHER THAN

196
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:36,423
MARK JUDGE AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

197
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:38,325
NO OTHER WITNESSES LISTED, NO

198
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:40,026
ONE HAS CORROBORATED THESE

199
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:40,360
CLAIMS.

200
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,496
DURING THE ALLEGED TIME PERIOD,

201
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,398
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN

202
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:45,298
COLLEGE WHILE KAVANAUGH WOULD

203
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:47,834
HAVE BEEN A 15 OR 16-YEAR-OLD

204
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:48,435
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.

205
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:52,940
SHE DESCRIBED BOYS WAITING IN

206
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,577
LINE TO RAPE DRUGGED WOMEN.

207
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:58,078
SHE SAID SHE WENT TO AT LEAST

208
00:06:58,078 --> 00:06:59,079
TEN OF THESE PARTIES AND MANY

209
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,880
MORE HAPPENED AND NOBODY EVER

210
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,684
TOLD THE TEACHER.

211
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,619
A LAW ENFORCEMENT

212
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:06,487
REPRESENTATIVE, APPEARANCE,

213
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:07,621
ANYBODY, EVERYONE THAT WAS A

214
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:10,658
PART OF THIS ALL KEPT IT SECRET.

215
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:11,692
IN A STATEMENT, KAVANAUGH

216
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,493
REACTED TO THIS AND THIS IS WHAT

217
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:14,828
HE SAID.

218
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:15,963
THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND FROM THE

219
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:16,630
TWILIGHT ZONE.

220
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,433
I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS IN THIS

221
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,034
NEVER HAPPENED.

222
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:22,236
TODAY, JUST HOURS AFTER THESE

223
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:24,038
ALLEGATIONS BECAME PUBLIC, 64

224
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:25,706
HIGH SCHOOL ACQUAINTANCES AND

225
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:26,573
FRIENDS OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH

226
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:29,877
RUSHED TO HIS DEFENSE IN A

227
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:31,245
STATEMENT, CALLING THESE CLAIMS

228
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:31,612
"NONSENSE.

229
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:33,480
WE NEVER WITNESSED ANY BEHAVIOR

230
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,816
THAT EVEN APPROACH IS WHAT IS

231
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:36,784
DESCRIBED IN THIS ALLEGATION.

232
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:40,220
IT IS REPREHENSIBLE AND THE

233
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,422
EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAVE

234
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:45,226
COLLECTIVELY SPENT WITH BRETT

235
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:46,126
KAVANAUGH, WE DO NOT RECALL

236
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:50,030
HAVING EVER MET SOMEONE NAMED

237
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,832
JULIE SWETNICK, NOR DID WE EVER

238
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:52,933
OBSERVE HIM ENGAGING IN ANY

239
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:57,838
CONDUCT RESEMBLING THAT

240
00:07:57,838 --> 00:07:58,506
DESCRIBED IN HER SO-CALLED

241
00:07:58,506 --> 00:08:00,007
DECLARATION.

242
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:02,376
REMEMBER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH TOLD

243
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:03,644
OUR OWN MARTHA MacCALLUM THAT

244
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:05,646
HE WAS A THROUGHOUT ALL OF

245
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:07,615
HIGH SCHOOL AND MOST OF COLLEGE.

246
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:08,449
CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE DISCUSSING

247
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,352
THIS, BUT WE ARE, IS WHAT HE

248
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:12,286
SAID.

249
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:13,421
>> PEOPLE GENERALLY IN

250
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:14,589
HIGH SCHOOL, I THINK ALL OF US

251
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,591
HAVE DONE THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL

252
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,593
THAT WE LOOK BACK ON AND REGRET

253
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:19,227
OR CRINGE A BIT.

254
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:21,229
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING

255
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,931
ABOUT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN

256
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:25,066
ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

257
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,834
I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

258
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,102
ANYONE, I NEVER HAD ANY

259
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:30,071
INTERCOURSE OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO

260
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:32,440
INTERCOURSE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

261
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,075
MANY YEARS THEREAFTER.

262
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:34,942
THE GIRLS FROM THE SCHOOLS I

263
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:38,446
WENT TO AND I WERE FINE.

264
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:40,081
>> SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT

265
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,482
THEY'RE ALL THESE YEARS IN

266
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:42,683
QUESTION YOU ARE A?

267
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:44,786
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

268
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:47,188
>> IF YOU NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE

269
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:48,489
WITH ANYONE HIGH SCHOOL AND

270
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:49,524
THROUGH COLLEGE SINCE WE ARE

271
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:52,260
PROBING INTO YOUR PERSONAL LIFE

272
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,560
HERE?

273
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,595
>> MANY YEARS AFTER, I WILL

274
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:56,431
LEAVE IT AT THAT.

275
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:57,832
>> Sean: NOW TODAY

276
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:58,933
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM TWEETED

277
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:01,636
OUT "I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME

278
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,438
BELIEVING THAT ANY PERSON COULD

279
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:06,040
CONTINUE GOING TO TEN PARTIES

280
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,175
OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD WHERE

281
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:18,419
WOMEN WERE ROUTINELY GANG RAPE

282
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:19,187
ED AND NOT REPORTED.

283
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:21,322
WHY WOULD ANY PERSON CAN NEED TO

284
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:22,423
PUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FRIENDS

285
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:23,024
IN DANGER?

286
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:25,626
ISN'T THERE SOME DUTY TO WARN

287
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:26,461
OTHERS?

288
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:27,662
AND ALSO BREAKING MOMENTS BEFORE

289
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:29,530
WE CAME ON AIR, NEW REPORTS THAT

290
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,668
A RESTRAINING ORDER WAS FILED

291
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:34,836
AGAINST JULIE SWETNICK BY HER

292
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:36,471
EX-BOYFRIEND IN 2001.

293
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:38,673
HER BOYFRIEND TONIGHT TELLING

294
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:39,507
THE POLITICO "RIGHT AFTER I

295
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,209
BROKE UP WITH HER SHE WAS

296
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,745
THREATENING MY FAMILY, MY WIFE,

297
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:44,646
THREATENING TO DO HARM TO MY

298
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:47,749
BABY AT THAT TIME.

299
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:49,417
AND THEN SHE SAID IN A TELEPHONE

300
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,218
CONVERSATION WITH POLITICO, I

301
00:09:50,218 --> 00:09:52,687
KNOW A LOT ABOUT HER, SHE'S NOT

302
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:55,623
CREDIBLE AT ALL, HE SAID IT, NOT

303
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:55,957
AT ALL.

304
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:57,025
LOOK WITH

305
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:57,859

ROUGHLY A DECADE AGO, JULIE

SHE FILED.

314

ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR

315
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,043
WITH HER, THE FIRM WAS RUN BY

316
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:17,746
DEBORAH KATZ, THE LAWYER

CURRENTLY REPRESENTING DR. FORD

SHOW DEAL, YOU HAVE, AND THIS IS

00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:32,794
WHY WE ARE IN A CRISIS IN THIS

COUNTRY.

326
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,431
MANY IN THE LEFT, MANY IN THE

327
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:38,000
MEDIA, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

328
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,667
THEY HAVE ALREADY CONVICTED

329
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:43,438
JUDGE KAVANAUGH OF WHAT A

330
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:44,239
HORRIFIC, LIFE SHATTERING CLAIM

331
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:47,843

332
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:48,443

DEFINING MOMENT THIS WEEK.

335

WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE

336
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,655
COFFEE GOING TO PRISON AND THEN

337
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,823
KAVANAUGH GOING TO THE HIGHEST

338
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:02,391

WHITE MALE DEFENSE.

>> PART OF THIS BACKLASH THAT WE

342
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:13,201
ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW COMES FROM

343
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:13,802
A CULTURE OF SEXISM AND

344
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:22,110
PATERNALISM IN THIS COUNTRY, AND

345
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,811
THAT SILENCE GENERATION AFTER

346
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:23,211
GENERATION.

347
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:26,248
>> THIS IS A PATRIARCHAL ON FOR

348
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:28,650
MY FULL DISPLAY.

349
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:35,558
>> THAT TO ME -- IT JUST WAS NOT

350
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:36,225
BELIEVABLE.

351
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:39,462
>> WE ALLOW THE PREDATOR IN

HE IS PICKING THE TYPE OF PEOPLE

356
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:51,040
THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY LIKE HIM.

357
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,708
AND THIS THING AS A WHOLE

358
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,444
INVESTIGATION NOW, IT SHOULD NOT

359
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:55,845
GO FORWARD.

360
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:56,913
>> Sean: WHILE THE LEFT, THE

MEDIA AND THE DEMOCRATS ALL RUSH

362
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:04,921
TO JUDGMENT, MANY OTHERS WITH

363
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:06,589
SERIOUS CRIMINAL CLAIMS WILL

364
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,090
UTILIZE THE SERVICES OF THE

365
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,693
POLITICAL, VERY ANTI-TRUMPET,

366
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:13,629
AND IT'S A SLEAZY LAWYER NAMED

367
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:14,130
MICHAEL AVENATTI.

368
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,931
EARLIER TODAY THE PRESIDENT HAD

369
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:17,667
THIS TO SAY ABOUT HIM, TAKE A

370
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:17,967
LOOK.

371
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:18,634
>> President Trump: IF YOU

372
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,136
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LAWYER THAT

373
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:22,638
JUST CAME OUT, HE'S A LOWLIFE.

374
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,373
HE REPRESENTED DEMOCRATS AND

375
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:27,410
NOBODY EVER TALKS ABOUT THAT.

376
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,012
IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD ONE BUT HE

377
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:32,648
IS A DEMOCRATIC LAWYER SO IT'S A

378
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:33,950
HORRIBLE CON GAME AND I THINK

379
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,185
THE PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT OUT.

380
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:37,553
>> Sean: I WANT EVERYONE TO

381
00:12:37,553 --> 00:12:39,055
THINK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I

382
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:41,324
BELIEVE AMERICANS ARE

383
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:42,391
FAIR-MINDED.

384
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:43,860
THIS ISN'T ABOUT REPUBLICANS OR

385
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,995
DEMOCRATS DENIED ALL OR

386
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,063
CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL.

387
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,464
MICHAEL AVENATTI, NANCY PELOSI,

388
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:51,534
MAXINE WATERS, NOW THE NEW FACES

389
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:52,235
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

390
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:54,470
WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN 41 DAYS.

391
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,039
I CALL MENOTTI GEARING UP FOR A

392
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,540
PRESIDENTIAL RUN.

393
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,275
THIS IS NOW, AND THIS IS WHAT WE

394
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:00,643
GOT TO THINK ABOUT.

395
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:03,446
THIS IS NOW A PARTY OF NO DUE

396
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:07,049
PROCESS, NO RULE OF LAW, NO

397
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:07,817
CONSTITUTION, A ZERO PRESUMPTION

398
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:08,251
OF INNOCENCE.

399
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:11,621
DO YOU KNOW, IT'S IN THE LAST 12

400
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,422
DAYS I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE

401
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:14,090
DEMOCRAT THAT IS WILLING TO

402
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,294
DEFEND THE PRINCIPAL OF

403
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,028
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND DUE

404
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,063
PROCESS?

405
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:21,664
BY THE WAY, THE PARTY OF

406
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:24,434
BILL CLINTON AND KEITH ELLISON.

407
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:26,069
SO TONIGHT WHAT WE ARE SEEING

408
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:27,036
FROM MICHAEL AVENATTI ON THE

409
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:29,439
PEOPLE ON THE LEFT IN THIS

410
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,240
COUNTRY, SADLY, I TELL YOU THIS

411
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,442
ALL THE TIME.

412
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:35,445
THEY USE THIS TACTIC EVERY TWO

413
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:37,013
AND FOUR YEARS, CHARACTER

414
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:37,447
ASSASSINATION.

415
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,315
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE TOOL IN THE

416
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:40,016
DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK AND

417
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:40,717
SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT CALLED

418
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:43,820
OUT EARLY TODAY AND A POWERFUL

419
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,387
PRESS CONFERENCE.

420
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:46,623
HOW OFTEN DO I SAY EVERY TWO OR

421
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,258
FOUR YEARS, THEY WILL CALL

422
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:49,259
REPUBLICANS RACIST?

423
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,763
HOW HORRIBLE IS THAT, SEXIST AND

424
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:56,266
MISOGYNIST, XENA PHOBIC AND

425
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:56,899
HOMOPHOBIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC?

426
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,067
REPUBLICANS WANT DIRTY AIR AND

427
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:58,835
WATER AND THEY WANT CHILDREN TO

428
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:01,070
DIE AND THEY WANT TO THROW

429
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,272
GRANNY OVER THE CLIFF.

430
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,473
WE'VE NOW GOTTEN USED TO IT.

431
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,775
BUT TO SAY THAT ABOUT PEOPLE,

432
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,710
EVERY ELECTION SEASON, TO DO

433
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,078
THIS WITH EVERY SUPREME COURT

434
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:10,280
NOMINEE, HERE'S WHAT THE

435
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,815
PRESIDENT SAID.

436
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:13,650
>> President Trump: THEY ARE

437
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,851
ACTUALLY CON ARTISTS BECAUSE

438
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:15,952
THEY KNOW WHAT QUALITY THIS MAN

439
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:17,320
IS AND THEY'VE DESTROYED A MAN'S

440
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,655
REPUTATION AND THEY WANT TO

441
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:19,656
DESTROY IT EVEN MORE.

442
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,191
I THINK PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT IN

443
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,325
THE MIDTERMS, BUT THEY HAVE DONE

444
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:24,060
TO THIS FAMILY AND WHAT THEY

445
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,662
HAVE DONE TO THESE CHILDREN,

446
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:26,463
THESE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN OF HIS

447
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:29,432
AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO HIS

448
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:30,033
WIFE.

449
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:33,870
AND THEY KNOW IT IS A BIG FAT

450
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,437
CON JOB.

451
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:36,239
THEY GO INTO A ROOM AND I

452
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:38,208
GUARANTEE YOU, THEY LAUGH LIKE

453
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,042
HELL AT WHAT THEY HAVE PULLED

454
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:44,147
OFF ON YOU AND ON THE PUBLIC.

455
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:44,914
THEY LAUGH LIKE HELL.

456
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:46,249
>> Sean: THE PRESIDENT KNOWS

457
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,351
THE SHAMEFUL TACTICS OF THE LEFT

458
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:48,718
FIRSTHAND.

459
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:50,654
REMEMBER DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL

460
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:51,688
ELECTION, REMEMBER WHEN

461
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:52,956
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," I THINK IT

462
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:56,326
WAS TOP FOLD, THEY FALSELY

463
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:58,328
ACCUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP

464
00:14:58,328 --> 00:14:59,062
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, THE SO-CALLED

465
00:14:59,062 --> 00:14:59,529
BOMBSHELL STORY.

466
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,765
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SOURCE

467
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,267
OF THE TIME USED DENIED TRUMP

468
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:05,235
EVER ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY.

469
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:06,269
WE KNOW BECAUSE WE INTERVIEWED

470
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:08,271
SOME OF THEM, A NUMBER OF THEM.

471
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,906
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID

472
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:13,043
ABOUT THAT EARLIER TODAY.

473
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,177
>> President Trump: I WAS

474
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:18,181
ACCUSED BY, I BELIEVE IT WAS FOR

475
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:19,482
WOMEN.

476
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:20,250
YOU CAN CHECK WITH SEAN HANNITY

477
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,285
OR FOX BECAUSE THEY COVERED IT

478
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:22,719
VERY STRONGLY.

479
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,455
I WAS ACCUSED BY FOUR OR FIVE

480
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:26,223
WOMEN WHO GOT PAID A LOT OF

481
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:28,925
MONEY TO MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT

482
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:29,392
ME.

483
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:32,629
WE CAUGHT THEM IN THE MAINSTREAM

484
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:33,864
MEDIA REFUSED TO PUT THAT ON

485
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:34,831
TELEVISION.

486
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:37,334
THEY REFUSE TO EVEN WRITE ABOUT

487
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:37,634
IT.

488
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,635
>> Sean: WE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED

489
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:39,269
UP ON THAT PROGRAM.

490
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,238
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE MEDIA

491
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:42,906
IGNORING AND GOING ALONG WITH

492
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:43,707
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND WHAT

493
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,041
THEY PUT OUT.

494
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,143
I ACTUALLY DID SOME REPORTING

495
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:47,110
AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

496
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,648
INTERVIEW THE WOMEN FROM THE AT

497
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:52,516
TIMES FAKE NEWS STORY.

498
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,251
HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID AFTER THE

499
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,652
TIMES MAKE THE ACCUSATION.

500
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:56,153
TAKE A LOOK.

501
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:58,055
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BE

502
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,891
ANYTHING BUT A GENTLEMAN, A VERY

503
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,793
GRACIOUS TO WOMEN AND RESPECTFUL

504
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:03,160
OF WOMEN.

505
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,828
ANYBODY THAT TELLS ME THAT I SAW

506
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,731
THAT IT IS.

507
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,066
HE WASN'T THAT WAY TO ME OR

508
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:09,466
ANYBODY.

509
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,835
I MET A LOT OF WOMEN WHEN HE WAS

510
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:12,269
AROUND.

511
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:13,671
HE EMPLOYS A LOT OF WOMEN AT

512
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,873
DEALS WITH A LOT OF WOMEN AND HE

513
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:17,374
RESPECTS THEM AND THEY RESPECT

514
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:17,675
HIM.

515
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:19,276
>> I BASICALLY WOULDN'T GIVE

516
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:20,477
THEM A STORY AND THEN THEY CAME

517
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:21,679
OUT WITH THEIR OWN VERSION OF IT

518
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,314
AND TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF MY

519
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:25,115
BOOK AND TOTALLY TWISTED IT AND

520
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:26,884
MADE IT SO NEGATIVE.

521
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,819
I HAVE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE

522
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:31,889
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUM

523
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:32,323
DONALD TRUMP.

524
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:33,424
>> Sean: I DON'T REMEMBER THE

525
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:34,858
RETRACTION IN

526
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:35,526
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" EITHER.

527
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:36,460
THE LEFT'S CHARACTER

528
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,628
ASSASSINATION STRATEGY DIDN'T

529
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:39,530
START WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S

530
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,864
A TIME-TESTED PRACTICE FROM THE

531
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:41,632
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

532
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:43,968
REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID TO

533
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:48,406
SUPREME COURT, ROBERT        ROB

534
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:48,439
SUPREME COURT, ROBERT        ROR

535
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:48,472
SUPREME COURT, ROBERT        ROT

536
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:48,506
SUPREME COURT, ROBERT        ROB

537
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:42,933
SUPREME COURT, ROBERT        ROR

538
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:48,539
REAGAN'S NOMINEE FOR THE U.S.

539
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:48,773
SUPREME COURT, ROBERT        RO?

540
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:54,178
HE WAS NEVER NOMINATED BECAUSE

541
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:54,712
OF ALL THE SLANDER.

542
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:59,250
THE GUY THAT TOLD NOBODY AFTER

543
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,253
HE LEFT A WOMAN TO DIE AFTER A

544
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:03,854
CAR ACCIDENT AND WENT HOME AND

545
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:05,356
WENT TO BED?

546
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:06,857
ROBERT CHAPPAQUIDDICK KENNEDY.

547
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:08,326
>> THIS IS A LAND WHERE WOMEN

548
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:11,162
WILL BE FORCED INTO BACK ALLEY

549
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:11,862
ABORTIONS, BLACK WOULD SIT AT

550
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:15,833
SEGREGATED LUNCH COUNTERS, ROGUE

551
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,867
POLICE COULD BREAK DOWN CITIZEN

552
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:20,104
STORES IN MIDNIGHT RAIDS AND

553
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,073
WRITERS AND ARTISTS WOULD BE

554
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:22,673
CENSURED AT THE WHIM OF

555
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:23,074
GOVERNMENT.

556
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,974
>> Sean: THEN A FEW YEARS

557
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:26,242
LATER, OF COURSE DEMOCRATS TRIED

558
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:28,646
TO BRING THE PRIME COURT JUSTICE

559
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:30,081
WHO BECAME ONE OF THE FINEST

560
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:30,848

CLARENCE THOMAS, THROUGH THE

562
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:35,453
MUD.

563
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,488
1991, SENATE DEMOCRATS PULLED

564
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:39,657
OUT HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE ANITA

565
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:40,458
HILL MAKING SEXUAL HARASSMENT

566
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,460
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM.

567
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,661
SOUND FAMILIAR?

568
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:44,929
THIS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION WAS

569
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,932
SO VICIOUS AND SO HORRIBLE, SO

570
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:49,934
NASTY, JUSTICE THOMAS CALLED IT

571
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:50,501
A HIGH-TECH LYNCHING.

572
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:52,537
TAKE A LOOK.

573
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:55,273
>> THIS IS A CIRCUS, IT'S A

574
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,275
NATIONAL DISGRACE.

575
00:17:57,275 --> 00:18:00,845
AND FROM MY STANDPOINT AS A

576
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:03,014
BLACK AMERICAN, AS FAR AS I'M

577
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:04,182
CONCERNED, IT IS A HIGH-TECH

578
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:07,452
LYNCHING FOR UPPITY BLACKS WHO

579
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,821
IN ANY WAY DEIGNED TO THINK FOR

580
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:10,221
THEMSELVES.

581
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:13,291
TO DO FOR THEMSELVES.

582
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,659
TO HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS.

583
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,361
AND IT IS A MESSAGE THAT UNLESS

584
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,664
YOU KOWTOW TO AN OLD ORDER, THIS

585
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:22,901
IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.

586
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:26,371
YOU WILL BE LYNCHED, DESTROYED,

587
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:31,776
CARICATURED BY A COMMITTEE OF

588
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:34,979
THE U.S. SENATE, RATHER THAN

589
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:36,247
HUNG FROM A TREE.

590
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:37,916
>> Sean: THE CIRCUS OF

591
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,017
DISGRACE IS BACK IN WASHINGTON

592
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,986
AND THESE TACTICS DON'T STOP AT

593
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,254
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEES, MANY

594
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,490
ALSO TRY TO DESTROY THE

595
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:45,857
CHARACTER.

596
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:49,027
I KNOW, I WAS IN ATLANTA AT THE

597
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,663
TIME OF THE OLYMPIC BOMBING.

598
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,264
RICHARD JEWELL FALSELY ACCUSED

599
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:55,066
AS BEING THE LONE BOMBER.

600
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,100
HE FIT THE PROFILE BECAUSE HE

601
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,468
LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER.

602
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:58,269
HE WAS LISTENING TO MY RADIO

603
00:18:58,269 --> 00:18:59,571
SHOW AT THE TIME AND SAID I WAS

604
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,805
THE ONLY ONE THAT STOOD UP FOR

605
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:04,242
HIM AT LEAST GAVE HIM THE

606
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:05,243
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

607
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,278
HE CHANGED MY LIFE.

608
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:08,880
THEY ALSO SMEARED FALSELY

609
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,582
ACCUSED -- REMEMBER THE DUKE

610
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,316
LACROSSE TEAM?

611
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,517
WE DIDN'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON

612
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,318
THE SHOW.

613
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,086
AND LET'S NOT FORGET WITH THE

614
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:15,687
LEFT DATED IN FERGUSON.

615
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,289
DARREN WILSON WAS FOUND INNOCENT

616
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,258
IN THAT CASE.

617
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:21,293
REMEMBER BALTIMORE, FREDDIE

618
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:21,693
GRAY?

619
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,663
TRAVE ON MARTIN, GEORGE

620
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,030
ZIMMERMAN.

621
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,264
HOW MANY TIMES DID

622
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:27,465
PRESIDENT OBAMA RUSH TO

623
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:28,667
JUDGMENT?

624
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,868
THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE ACTED

625
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:30,268
STUPIDLY.

626
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:31,736
DURING EVERY BIG MOMENT, SO MANY

627
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:33,638
IN THE LEFT AND SO MANY IN THE

628
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:35,807
PRESS RUSHED TO JUDGMENT FOR

629
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,641
PURE POLITICAL GAIN.

630
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,909
THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION OF

631
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,044
INNOCENCE EVER WITH THESE PEOPLE

632
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:44,216
WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS.

633
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:44,783
HARRY REID LIES ABOUT

634
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,251
MITT ROMNEY AND SAID HE HASN'T

635
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,452
PAID TAXES IN TEN YEARS.

636
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,488
WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT LATER AFTER

637
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,556
THE ELECTION AND ROMNEY LOST, HE

638
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:52,457
BOASTS ABOUT EIGHT.

639
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,459
HE'S PROUD OF HIS LIFE.

640
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,062
THIS HAPPENS EVERY ELECTION

641
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:57,696
SEASON, ONE OF THE BIGGEST

642
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:02,067
SMEARED JOBS OF ALL COMES FROM

643
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:02,935
CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S DIRTY

644
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:03,268
DOSSIER.

645
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,937
A DOCUMENT BOUGHT AND PAID FOR

646
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,272
BY HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DNC

647
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,207
TO LIE TO YOU, THE AMERICAN

648
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,643
PEOPLE, TO REAGAN ELECTION IN

649
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,445
THIS COUNTRY AND THEN TO DESTROY

650
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,448
A PRESIDENT AFTER WITH ABSURD

651
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,250
UNTRUE SALACIOUS CLAIMS LIKE

652
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,550
THIS.

653
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,720
TRUMPS A "PERVERTED CONDUCT IN

654
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,256
MOSCOW INCLUDED PAIRING THE

655
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,023
PRESIDENTIAL SUITE AT THE HOTEL

656
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:29,928
WHERE HE KNEW PRESIDENT OBAMA

657
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:30,662
HAD STAYED ON ONE OF THE TRIPS

658
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,699
TO RUSSIA AND DEFILING THE BED

659
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,901
WHERE THEY HAD SLEPT BY HIRING A

660
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:42,274
NUMBER OF TO PERFORM GOLDEN

661
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,008
SHOWERS, IN OTHER WORDS, IN

662
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,577
FRONT OF HIM.

663
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,614
HE SAID THAT DOSSIER, THERE IS

664
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:50,282
ONLY A 50/50 CHANCE.

665
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,984
THOSE LIES WERE SPREAD TO YOU OF

666
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,085
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

667
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,188
HILLARY PAID FOR IT, RUSSIAN

668
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:56,755
ALLIES OF ALL THINGS.

669
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,723
YET THE LEFT PUSH THESE

670
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,059
UNVERIFIED AND UNCORROBORATED

671
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,226
CLAIMS THROUGHOUT THE HIGHEST

672
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,661
LEVELS OF OUR GOVERNMENT RIGHT

673
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,897
INTO THE GULLIBLE MEDIA, THEIR

674
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,231
ARM THAT PUSHES THEIR

675
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:06,632
PROPAGANDA.

676
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,467
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE LEFT'S

677
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,935
ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THE LIVES OF

678
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,871
PEOPLE WITH BASELESS CLAIMS, IT

679
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,873
IS A CLEAR, OBVIOUS AND NOW

680
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,810
PREDICTABLE PATTERN.

681
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,377
THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE

682
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,279
UNFORTUNATELY, THESE ARE REAL

683
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,548
LIVES WHEN YOU SAY THAT SOMEONE

684
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,284
IS A RACIST OR SEXIST OR

685
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,686
HOMOPHOBE, A GANG, REAL

686
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,053
FAMILIES.

687
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,056
DEMOCRATS, USING ALL OF THEM.

688
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,225
PAWNS IN A POLITICAL GAIN, NO

689
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,660
DUE PROCESS AND NO PERCEPTION OF

690
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,094
INNOCENCE.

691
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,297
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF IT WAS

692
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,665
YOU, AMERICA COMES TONIGHT?

693
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,033
BECAUSE THIS IS THE MODERN

694
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:41,533
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

695
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,069
THEY HAVE NOW DEFINED OF

696
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,538
THEMSELVES AS A PARTY OF

697
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,706
SLANDERERS, SMEAR, CHARACTER

698
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,274
ASSASSINATION AND A PARTY OF

699
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,242
THIS PARCHMENT.

700
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:50,976
THIS IS CLEARLY WHO THEY ARE

701
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,645
BECAUSE I CAN'T FIND A DEMOCRAT

702
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,080
NOW SAYING THEY BELIEVE IN THE

703
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,881
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

704
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,283
THIS NOW DEFINES THEM.

705
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,484
THE ONLY ONE POWER FOR

706
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:58,884
THEMSELVES.

707
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,486
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THE

708
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,721
ECONOMY, ABOUT SECURITY FOR THE

709
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,256
AMERICAN PEOPLE?

710
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,691
THIS IS WHY EVERY FAIR-MINDED

711
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,360
AMERICAN HAS A RIGHT TO BE

712
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,427
SKEPTICAL TONIGHT.

713
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,263
WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING IS ONE

714
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,431
OF THE UGLIEST SMEAR CAMPAIGNS

715
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:12,965
IN HISTORY.

716
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,900
IF AMERICA DOESN'T GET THIS

717
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,137
RIGHT, THERE WILL BE NO GOOD

718
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,839
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVER

719
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,875
WANT TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY FOR

720
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,876
DECADES TO COME.

721
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:24,543
WHY WOULD THEY?

722
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,279
THEY ARE NOT DOING IT FOR THE

723
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,080
MONEY.

724
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,515
DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF

725
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,282
NO DUE PROCESS.

726
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,617
THEY ARE THE PARTY OF NO

727
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,053
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

728
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,454
THEY ARE NOT THE PARTY THAT

729
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,257
BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION.

730
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,426
AS ONE DEMOCRAT SAID,

731
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:41,060
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE?

732
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,395
I HAVEN'T HEARD THEM.

733
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:44,263
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

734
00:22:44,263 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE THEY ALL SEEM TO BELIEVE
