1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,509
According to reports, Neo-Nazism is becoming
more popular and politically influential across

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:09,769
Europe, even gaining seats in some national
parliaments.

3
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,969
Germany has one of the largest neo-Nazi parties,
called the National Democratic Party,

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:19,930
or NPD. Just like the original Nazi party
in the 1920s and 30s, the NPD labels itself

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,850
“national

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,450
socialist” . A spokesperson for German Chancellor,
Angela Merkel,

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:31,200
called the NPD “anti-democratic, xenophobic,
anti-Semitic and ... a threat to the constitution.”

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,200
In

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,699
recent years, the NPD has gained a seat in
two out of the sixteen regional German parliaments

10
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:36,629
.

11
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:42,050
And in 2014, Udo Voigt holocaust denier and
former leader of the NPD,

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,010
joined the European Parliament as an elected
member . Officials in Germany have launched

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,399
a legal attempt to ban the party, as they’ve
done successfully in the past with two other

14
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,100
Nazi-
sympathizing political parties, but haven’t

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,659
found success yet.

16
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:00,510
Other European countries are also dealing
with this problem. In Greece, in 2014, the

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:00,969
“Golden

18
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,810
Dawn” party received over 9 percent of the
vote, gaining 3 seats in the European parliament.

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,340
In

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,870
Slovakia, in 2013, the former leader of a
banned neo-Nazi organization was elected governor

21
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,120
to

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,330
a large central region. And Russian President
Vladimir Putin remarked in 2014, that open

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,120
neo-
Nazism has “become commonplace in Latvia

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,810
and other Baltic states.”

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:29,510
So, what is causing the re-emergence of National
Socialism? Some experts think the rise of

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,950
nazi values is caused by a sudden influx of
immigrants. The New York Times notes that

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:31,970
ethnic

28
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,730
tensions have emerged in Germany because of
“demographic changes.” The International

29
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:40,050
Business Times finds that since 2013, a flood
of Syrian refugees have entered Bulgaria and

30
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,690
sparked anti-immigrant protests and attacks
there.

31
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,850
Others have linked the 2008 European recession
and high youth unemployment with the rise

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,710
of neo-Nazism. With around 20 to 50 percent
of young people unemployed in some nations,

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:53,990
the

34
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,400
neo-Nazi parties function as a gang or a cult
that recruits the young and the poor.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,730
World leaders are watching the re-kindling
of neo-Nazism carefully and doing their best

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,380
to stem the tide. The fact is that Nazi salutes
and paraphernalia have been made illegal in

37
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,590
some places like Germany, but Nazis values
are unfortunately more difficult to regulate

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:13,650
than

39
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,220
paraphernalia. And as a result Nazism is still
alive, just under different names.

40
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,500
You know what would be the ultimate way to
troll this video? NOT putting pro Nazi

41
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,930
comments. Man would that show us. Thanks for
watching.
