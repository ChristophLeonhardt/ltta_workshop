1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,620
It was about three o'clock
when the water started coming

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,510
into our house and 
we saw everything that we own

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,019
just floating.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,179
It's all gone. 
All we loved it was up to

5
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,699
my knees in the house.

6
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,069
All of our stuff was gone.

7
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:27,709
Everything in our house, our car,
everything was gone.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,880
I got my wife out, 
I got my dog and our cat.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,810
I got my 80-year-old father
with type 2 diabetes out.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,120
I had to wade through 
chest-high water.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,619
We finally got onto
a decent half.

12
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:52,549
The National Guard came and got us.
And they took us to a shelter

13
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:56,240
on Aldine Mail Rte Rd.
Aldine Westfield.

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,320
And it was terrible.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,320
It was crowded very,
very crazy.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,479
You know, I mean they're
doing their best but they

17
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,149
weren't ready for it,
nobody in Houston was ready for it.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,620
So now we are at this shelter,
we finally got out,

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,560
They are doing such
an amazing job helping

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,131
everybody and making sure
they're dry

21
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,131
and have food and a place to stay.

22
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,730
We lost everything, we left out
with the clothes on our bags,

23
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,100
and our animals and 
we don't know what to do.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,650
Now we know we have to rebuild
but it's devastating to see the amount

25
00:01:36,650 --> 00:00:00,000
of pain everybody's in,
everybody lost everything.
