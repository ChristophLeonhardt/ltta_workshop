pressing these buttons is way way too easy and and so it makes us callous so it there might be one situation where pressing the button is right but there ain't a hundred situations where it's right and even Obama was pressing that bump button I don't want to say willy nilly but with those signature strikes pretty fucking close right with him whether he was right or wrong he thought through they everything very clinically and academically and said which is all but a little bit scarier and so having worse I'm just saying at least I understood him first of all I understood the way he went about stuff that feeds into the narrative of Obama was the intellectual of guy approaching all this because he said I'm going to kill this many people in this way save my soldiers and you know potentially folks back home who would have been killed by terrorist attacks by these people I mean I'm sure it weighed on him but I think the way he got around it weighing on him was a dispassionate non empathetic approach that yeah logic and algebra yeah so that was the why they called him a Vulcan right and I get it but I'm not buying it I think that he lacked the courage to say no to signature strikes and double taps you know and and but but that's is it like when you go down that rabbit hole it's so disconcerting that you almost don't want to think about it because he says he's a rock star now as we were talking about earlier and he's on yachts and taking pictures and sending cute tweets and everybody loves him yeah but in order but he had to make a political calculation that come on you he really thought those signature strikes save lives when he didn't even know who they were bombing and but he thought it makes them look tough and and more than that is that well the generals say I have to do it and if I don't do it then it'll Dale leak and it'll cause problems and I love you and they'll come into my eyes you can live with yourself it's easier to do it yeah and then then you get yourself to believe that you have to do it when if if he had more moral courage and I know I know easy for me to say it cetera but don't we know he did it right that's my job to say it whether it's easier or hard and also you have all these people who love Obama who are saying holding him up as an example this great guy only so great under Obama good thing you know if you're gonna hold him up to that standard then you can't blame me for holding into that Center - right that's and that's a more developed more compelling character structure anyway for like someone it mean that that's one of those things ripple with a character in movie I'd be like yeah that's a really well-crafted character yeah it'll come problems for someone weak you know that's right where whereas if you sort of trumpet a movie you wouldn't believe it he's like well that's a ridiculous character what a beer a movie this is I don't want people to get the wrong idea Trump has increased the number of civilians killed for X since Obama left right so I don't want to set up an equivalency Trump is way worse he's careless does never even had that thought so I you know we're having a discussion of is it worse that you know it you thought it through and you did it anyway and my answer is no it's that's bad but it's way worse to not care about other human beings lives and quadruple the number of civilians that are being killed
