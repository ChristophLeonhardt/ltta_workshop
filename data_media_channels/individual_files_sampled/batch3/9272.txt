REACHING A TRADE DEAL WITH OUR NORTH AMERICAN NEIGHBORS. STEVE: THE PRESIDENT TWEETING MOMENTS AGO CONGRATULATIONS TO MEXICO AND CANADA. BRIAN: YEP. IT'S EXPECTED TO BE SIGNED BY ALL THREE NATIONS BEFORE DECEMBER 1st AND THEN THE TOUGH PART OF RATIFYING IT. IF IT DOESN'T APPROVE IT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THIS BEING A POLITICAL PLAY. STEVE: YOU ARE FUNNY. BRIAN: JOINING US NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING ADVISOR HIMSELF PETER NAVARRO. PETER, HOW WHAT COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE DEAL THAT WAS REACHED LAST NIGHT? BIGGEST DEAL IN HISTORY NO HYPERBOLE. $1.2 TRILLION IN TRADE. GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA AND GREAT DAY FOR NORTH AMERICA. BRIAN, MY FAVORITE PART OF THE DEAL IS THE FACT IT'S GOING TO TURN THIS HEMISPHERE BACK INTO A MANUFACTURING POWER HOUSE. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RECLAIM OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, PARTICULARLY IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY. SO IT'S A GOOD DAY. AINSLEY: PETER, GIVE US AN EXAMPLE. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY WHO DOESN'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTANDING HOW TRADE WORKS. IF YOU ARE AN AUTO WORKER, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE BETTER PROSPECTS FOR JOBS AND WAGES ARE GOING TO GROUP FASTER. IF YOU ARE A CHICKEN FARMER YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF. IF YOU ARE A HIGH TECH BIOTECHNOLOGY FIRM, YOU ARE WORKING THERE. YOUR PATENTS ARE GOING TO BE BETTER PROTECTED UNDER. THIS WALL STREET BETTER OFF WITH THE FINANCIAL SUPERVISORS. IT'S REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY DEAL BECAUSE IT'S A CASE WHERE THIS PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL WHERE EVERYBODY IS BETTER OFF IN THIS. MEXICO, CANADA, AND THE U.S. TAKES VISION AND COURAGE TO DO THIS. IT'S A PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT. EVERYBODY CRITICIZED THIS PRESIDENT FOR TRYING TO UNDO NAFTA WORST TRADE DEAL WE HAVE EVER HAD. TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DONE. STEVE: PETER, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENT WHO WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE GOT TO GET RID OF THIS TRADE DEAL AND THAT TRADE DEAL THEY GO HE IS GOING TO SCREW UP EVERYTHING. NOW IT LOOKS AS IF BETTER DEALS WERE POSSIBLE. TWO MESSAGES, STEVE. ONE IS THAT QUIETLY, PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP IS PUTTING TOGETHER A RECORD ON THE ECONOMY AND TRADE, WHICH IS BETTER THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY. I SAID QUIETLY BECAUSE THE MEDIA HAS LARGELY IGNORED IT. TWO HIS CRITICS ON CAPITOL HILL AND THE MEDIA. EVERY TIME YOU CRITICIZE THIS PRESIDENT FOR BEING TOO TOUGH, YOU UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION TO NEGOTIATE TOUGH ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT HAS IGNORED THAT CRITICISM TO HIS CREDIT. HE STOOD TALL. AND, LOOK, STEVE, WE GOT NAFTA DONE. NAFTA IS DEAD. NEW AGREEMENT. TODAY BUT LAST WEEK WE ALSO SIGNED THAT SOUTH KOREAN DEAL. WE WERE ABLE TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN. AND I HAVE GOT TO TIP MY HAT HERE TO AMBASSADOR ROBERT LIGHTHIZER AND JARED KUSHNER WHO WORKED AS A TEAM TO BRING IT TO THE FINISH LINE IT WENT UP TO THE 11TH HOUR. AINSLEY: IT ALLOW THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT TO SIGN THE DEAL BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER. WILL THE NEXT PRESIDENT WHO TAKES HIS PLACE IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT HE COULD UNDO ANY OF THIS? NO. INCOMING PRESIDENT OF MEXICO AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE VERY CORDIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. IT'S ALL SET. THE WAY THIS IS GOING TO GO IS IT SHOULD BE SIGNED ON THE 30TH OF NOVEMBER AND THEN HAS TO BE RATIFIED. BRIAN: RIGHT. HERE IS THE DEAL FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW YOU WILL ALREADY BEGIN TO FEEL THE EFFECTS INVESTMENT IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS GOING TO SHIFT BACK HERE TO NORTH AMERICA. IT'S GOING TO MEAN MORE GROWTH, HIGHER WAGES, ALL GOOD. BRIAN: LASTLY, PETER, WHY NOT LOSES ALUMINUM AND STEEL TARIFFS THAT USE AS WEDGE TO GET EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE. YOU GOT THEM TO THE TABLE. YOU GOT A DEAL. WHY NOT PUSH THEM AWAY FROM MEXICO AND CANADA? WELL, SEPARATE ISSUE. APPLES AND ORANGES, BRIAN. IT WAS NEVER USED AS A BARGAINING CHIP, JUST APPLES AND ORANGES. STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS BOON TO THOSE TWO INDUSTRIES. THEY ARE TWO KEY PILLAR INDUSTRIES WE NEED FOR ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL SECURITY. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID, THE ECONOMIC SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY. SO LET'S FOCUS TODAY ON THE NAFTA, NAFTA IS DEAD. WE HAVE U.S. MCA. LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN PRONOUNCE THAT. BRIAN: YOU WENT TO BAT FOR THIS WHEN IT WASN'T POPULAR
