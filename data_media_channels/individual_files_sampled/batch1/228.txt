hello I'm Richard gisbert and you're at the listening post here are some of the media stories were tracking this week maybe you thought you knew just how much Facebook tracks you what you didn't know is how much of your information has been given to others al Jazeera is put under the microscope in the US as lawmakers seek to label it a foreign agent India is whatsapp's biggest single market the impact the messaging service is having on politics and society there is profound and on state-owned TV in Syria Bashar al-assad provides some drive-by journalism 2018 was going to be the year that Facebook would do things differently under intense scrutiny from governments and their regulators over fake news hate speech and political manipulation on his platform mark zuckerberg vowed to fix things then last weekend the New York Times along with the Guardian and Observer and channel 4 in the UK broke a story that shattered Zuckerberg PR campaign together they revealed that Cambridge analytic a data analysis firm employed by Donald Trump's election campaign harvested the personal information of more than 50 million American Facebook users without their permission and then used that information to create targeted political advertising in order to influence voter behavior the issues here go far beyond one data mining company and one election voters in Great Britain and Kenya may have been affected as well and the story puts the spotlight squarely on Facebook's business model and its mass surveillance of people like you and me to make their money our starting point this week is the man who blew the whistle and blew the lid off of one of social media's dirtiest secrets one of the more puzzling and contradictory aspects of this story is how even in this digital age where data has been crowned King information is often not enough sometimes the story needs a face a source willing to go on the record to register with audiences somebody like the Cambridge analytical whistleblower Chris white because the details what the company did how it mind Facebook for political purposes had been reported before more than two years ago well we've known the broad outlines of the Cambridge and Lucas story for a couple years since 2015 we've had a little bit more information in 2017 when the intercept published a long report on this as well but Christopher why we coming forward gives us a lot more detail on precisely how this worked it helps make the story concrete for people in a way that before it might have felt a bit abstract what Christopher Wiley showed was a bit of an insight into the inner workings of the company and how they wanted to build these models they called them psychographic models and so he he gave us the most detailed look yet at how Cambridge analytical works and what it was trying to do this story goes back four years to when Chris Wiley was Cambridge analytic a 's director of research the company contracted a British data scientist Alexander Cogan who had designed a Facebook survey app for a study into online behavior participants who downloaded Cogan's app and took the survey were each paid a dollar or two for that and for access to their personal data 270,000 people took part but it didn't end there like all other apps operating on Facebook at the time Cogan's app was able to harvest the information of not just participants who had consented but of all their Facebook friends as well who had no idea that their personal information was being collected it was no glitch it was a design feature of Facebook's platform that's how 270,000 participants in the u.s. exposed the private information of another 50 million Americans enabling Cambridge analytic to target those people with specifically tailored political ads on behalf of its client presidential candidate Donald Trump when you authorize those apps to access your profile you're potentially giving away huge amounts of information and so whilst facebook is ostensibly stunned and outraged by this kind of data collection it's exactly what the platform does exactly all the platforms they're for and it's what the policy specifically allowed back in 2014 now we should be shocked about this but we shouldn't be surprised companies and app developers and and scientists could develop apps plug them into the Facebook system and get access to all this rich data you know scholars who have been watching Facebook have been raising alarms about this since 2010 but nobody was listening nobody listened and except a few regulators in Europe and in Washington DC and Facebook encouraged it this was Facebook policy so now that Facebook people are acting all surprised all hurt like they're the victims I have to laugh it took Facebook more than four days for entire news cycles before its CEO managed to produce a response by that time the market had spoken shaving more than 50 billion dollars off the company's value Mark Zuckerberg post was apologetic Facebook failed its users he said mistakes were made the company had to do better this was a major and I'm really sorry that this happened among the things the Zuckerberg failed to mention in the media blitz that followed Facebook had threatened to sue The Times and The Guardian if they went ahead with the story and Zuckerberg implied that what those papers had reported was news to the company it wasn't as as far as we understood around the time of that episode there was no data out there as one commentator put it Mark Zuckerberg wasn't responding to the facts because the facts were not new together he was responding to the fewer which so Facebook discovered that this data had been passed to hands that it wasn't meant to be in back in 2015 and it moved to ask Cambridge analytical who had got the data to delete it did they check that you know they were just satisfied with the big question really as why didn't do anymore and how could it be sure that it had deleted it and the big question that regulators are gonna be asking Facebook is why didn't you tell us in 2015 and why didn't you ban Cambridge analytic her at that point because they actually only banned Cambridge analytical from Facebook just as this story was coming out last week what a weak response so they they don't they can't use Facebook like they can't they can't play words with friends anymore they can't post about their birthday parties that seems like a pretty useless penalty but it's all that they have but clearly Facebook had not cared to prevent this from happening had not audited the companies that had taken the data had not followed through Facebook had the legal and moral responsibility to make sure that this data stayed safe instead they have tried to make it just a matter of this sleazy company Cambridge analytical taking advantage of Facebook well of course they did this story forces us to consider not only Cambridge analytic er but Facebook itself the 50 million profiles that Cambridge analytic has allegedly is just 2 percent of Facebook's 2.2 billion profiles Facebook has in comfortable processing power compared to any other company so what are we going to do when Facebook decides to change its algorithms and manipulate and influence people towards its own political or commercial ends or what about when Facebook manipulates people's newsfeeds under government pressure how are democracies potentially being reshaped because Cambridge analytique de has not limited its work to the u.s. presidential election of 2016 that same year it worked for the leave side in Britain's brexit referendum and was also hired by President Kenyatta in last year's Kenyan election to electoral processes that were closed and in the case of Kenya dispute and those are just the campaign's that we know this is just the tip of the iceberg in many countries in the developing world Facebook is essentially synonymous with the internet thinking about a country like Myanmar country like Cambodia Facebook is how people interact with the Internet so there are enormous implications for the types of decisions that Facebook is making about who is allowed to provide political messaging on these platforms and who has the resources to do so information is power and data is power the average person goes onto Facebook to connect with friends and family but that's not what Facebook is therefore Facebook is a intelligence database essentially it's great that exists to gather data about people to better advertise to them this is a new way of doing modern politics and it just can't be sustainable we just can't have a democracy that relies on exploiting deeply personal information about people's private lives in order to try to recruit voters Facebook was perfectly designed to crush democracy to mess with democracy it was not intended to sort of accidentally turned out to be this perfect tool for this perfect storm and you can see democracy being threatened around the world right now it's not a coincidence that most of these forces find Facebook to be a very effective tool Facebook didn't cause our problems but Facebook is amplifying them it's a big problem it was a bad idea in the first place and there's almost nothing we can do we're discussing other media stories that are on our radar this week with one of our producers William will so post Cambridge analytical Facebook's reputation takes another hit and another tech giant google chooses this particular moment to make what it says is a big announcement to the news industry yes it's putting 300 million dollars behind what it calls the google news initiative but if that sounds like a handout to struggling news outlets let me explain why that's not the case what Google is announcing is 300 million dollars of investment over three years into projects that affect publishers news consumers a major focus of that is fake news although notably Google avoids completely using that term for example 10 million dollars goes to a global media literacy initiative to educate audiences about what is and is not credible news 3 million dollars of that has already been earmarked for a project in the u.s. leaving 7 million dollars for the rest of the world do we have any other specifics about where the money is going no none at all the rest of their extended press releases talk about Google's tools for news organizations to help them grow their digital advertising revenue but no mention that Google is one of the two companies along with Facebook who are most responsible for decimating the news industries and revenues in the first place another tool will help publishers use analytics to understand better how to get their readers to pay for a subscription but here's the kicker Google is encouraging publishers to get readers to subscribe through Google you've also been following a story that's a bit close to home since it involves Al Jazeera yes it's about this network status in the United States earlier this month 19 members of Congress wrote to the Justice Department demanding that al Jazeera be investigated as a potential foreign agent according to them al Jazeera incites violence and broadcasts hateful extremist content al Jazeera has responded saying it's shocking that lawmakers are calling for them to be registered under the foreign agent Registration Act which is actually a law that was originally used to combat Nazi propaganda and this is the same law that's already been applied to the Russian state-owned broadcaster arty isn't it yes that was last November after an intelligence report concluded as part of the Russia Gate inquiry that RT seeks to influence politics and fuel discontent in the u.s. it's noteworthy that the Press Freedom NGO reporters without borders said that such a move against Al Jazeera could constitute government censorship but there was no such outcry from rights groups on behalf of RT and why do you think that this is happening now well the two congressmen taking the lead on this are both pro-israel and the letter that they and 17 others have signed accuses al-jazeera of producing radical anti-american anti-semitic and anti-israel broadcasts that seems in line with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's threat to shut down al Jazeera's Jerusalem Bureau last year accusing the network of inciting violence now al Jazeera responded to that saying it was defamatory and part of an ongoing vicious attack on the network now in the background of all of this is a documentary produced by Al Jazeera's investigative unit on the pro-israel lobby in the US and that has yet to air okay thanks well fewer than one in four people in India owned a smartphone but when you're dealing with a country of more than 1.3 billion that's a lot of handsets 300 million 200 million of them are on whatsapp making India the messaging services biggest market nowhere else comes close and whatsapp has changed the way that Indians do things marketers who used to target customers through text messages now ping them on whatsapp political parties have made whatsapp strategies central to their campaign plans political activists are doing the same however India's whatsapp habit has a dark side as well misinformation disinformation rumors and false messages can go viral so can fear-mongering fake messages that can in half proven to be fatal in at least two cases such messages spread over whatsapp have led to mobs lynching innocent people the listening posts Meenakshi Rafi now on a dangerous at times deadly trend in India's most widely used messaging service in June 2017 a familiar image started doing the rounds on whatsapp in India it pushed all the buttons that the most viral whatsapp messages in India can push it was fear-mongering it threatened the specter of a violent and powerful Islamic extremist base in the country and it was reported as real news on one of India's louder more sensational channels invade the Hindu faith by carrying out conversions especially of young Hindu girls money is offered to these agents sometimes rate cards of dubious antecedents are also used to incentivize this activity it was claimed that Isis is circulating a red card in Kerala where various women of different religions in India were given prizes and what we found was that this rate card is actually a Photoshop rate card and it has been around for over seven years and it has been reported multiple times in the media it comes up as media news every year or every two year in my personal group suppose one polarizing story about say Muslims being lynched in India say this this video is from a country outside India but that that's being passed off by one of my relative who is rather ignorant who doesn't know how fake news works I would tend to believe and then out propagate that vicious cycle and probably post that disturbing video in 12 more whatsapp groups and part of whatsapp is very personal because it's groups that you know it's not you're not broadcasting to all these many people it feels like somebody is speaking more directly to you so things that once would have spread sort of word-of-mouth in your local neighborhood in your village in your community whatsapp has become a much much more powerful tool to amplify that sort of thing so unverified stories it's a source of a lot of sort of often inflammatory videos first time users in India who think that whatever comes in there what's happen box is true so friends and relatives sending whatsapp messages which are misleading is a cause for you know what's happening was becoming viral people not knowing that what everything is to be believed is also a major reason why what's happen was we are becoming so while the growth of whatsapp has coincided with a wave of political and social religious activism in India the ruling party BJP has been particularly adept at using the app opposition parties are playing catch-up but the BJP has been out front using the messenger as a powerful campaigning tool many religious and civic groups that share the BJP s Hindu nationalist agenda are also very active wat sappers take the cow protectors for instance who in parts of India operate with impunity as the party has focused its efforts on regulating cow slaughter and beef eating across the country dedicated groups have sprung up on whatsapp tracking and targeting those they suspect of harming animals considered sacred by Hindus just over three years ago in September 2015 in a village just outside of Delhi the local cow protection group got an alert of a man Muhammad o´clock who had supposedly killed a cow and stored its meat in his house that information has yet to be verified but it triggered a deadly domino effect people say this would they don't go to law enforcement agencies agencies they don't call up the police saying that looked is over there's a possibility that our clock had kill cow they go to his village drag him out and beat him to death and brutally assault his son when this lynching happened my investigation shows that the local watt sub Network ended in a Clark's village were abnormally active there has been a berry top of of grimmons perceived grievance which originates from those fake news which originates from fake pictures and fake videos circulated widely on whatsapp networks there are tensions periodically between different groups in India this is not new and usually it was sort of word-of-mouth and that was enough to get it going now whatsapp I think amplifies it on a scale that didn't really exist before so whatsapp is really in fact it's not just you know fake news it's actually fake news with consequences the whatsapp experience in India hasn't been all about fake news and bad consequences the messenger has opened new possibilities of communication across the country linking families communities of friends civic groups prayer groups and many more however it's the outsized and shocking impact that some of the more politically motivated groups have had that has sent up a flare one of those groups is the Gao Raksha Hindu dal a cow protection group that operates just outside New Delhi a spokesman of the group where'd Naga explained what whatsapp has meant for his organization's activities varsa pkg most of our members tend to be more active on water which makes it the ideal platform for us the best thing about using whatsapp is that it delivers our messages to our members instantly we have a system for relaying information to our group for example if the information is about a vehicle transporting beef we send it via text message if the message is urgent we send voice messages however if we have an advanced warning about the vehicle then I will compose a long message with the full details and forwarded to our members on what I was talking to one of these guys who was who runs this biggest whatsapp groups and network of whatsapp groups in Dadri where the lynching of a clock happened I asked him how do you get people to to be a part of your group he said it's very simple you just go to the mobile recharge shops in a village you go there you give you give him hundred bucks he'll give you the number of entire village and then you add these people Indian authorities are on the back foot when it comes to even beginning to deal with the challenges posed by the misuse of whatsapp there are more than 200 million Indians on the app texting voice messaging and video calling each other technologically and even in terms of regulation law enforcement officials have yet to catch up whatsapp itself says keeping a check on the spread of misinformation is quote complex earlier this year one of the company's engineers Alan cow said the key challenge to monitoring whatsapp was encryption it's one of the most valuable features of the messaging service helping ensure privacy and security but it makes it impossible to get to the root the source of some of the most dangerous messages being shared on the app whatsapp has into an encryption so whatsapp as a company cannot distinguish cannot actually track a message that has gone from A to B and B to C even though the message may be identical whatsapp has become the primary medium to spread rumors because people know that they will have legal immunity even if they are pushing out news which might lead to disastrous consequences like people being killed the country so polarized India is so extremely polarized right now on all sides the digital gate ization has increased much more now we are looking at millions of people in rural India being constantly being radicalized through whatsapp they may not be ideologically driven but they have been ideologically appropriated and finally take a certain kind of political leader put a state-owned television channel at their disposal and they will use it to aggrandize themselves through military parades cheering multitudes and televisual techniques that help seal their hold on power this past week though Syrian President Bashar al-assad took a different approach state-owned television there showed Assad at the wheel of his car no security in sight driving into the recently recaptured areas of eastern Goethe telling his audience what they were seeing the videos were clearly designed to counter the international news media's coverage of the Assad government military offensive what you do not see in the video that follows are all those images of the horrors of the Syrian war the civilian casualties children in hospitals refugees on the move all we get is an Assad I view we'll see you next time here at The Listening Post who'll be enough see him in sahat aluminum however we doing we don't pit out further what she found I cut the cigarette specialist at hidden as a reader Delta alpha total Mme a developed of the shock layer and a colorist also
