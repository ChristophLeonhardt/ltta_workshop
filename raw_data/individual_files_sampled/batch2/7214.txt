now I've been telling you guys for a long time that there is a massive anti-establishment mood all over the world's I said that Jeremy Corbyn would close a gigantic lead that his opponent had in the UK and folks thought that didn't make any sense because UK just voted for brexit that means they're going right-wing no people are not going right-wing they're not going left-wing they're just saying no more to the establishment we can't take it anymore and it drives me crazy when folks can't figure out the clear direction that the voters are sending again all across the world they've done it again now in Italy at least this time a lot of the press is beginning to pick up on how like huh and but that's what is so obvious so let me give it to you we go to Express first over in the UK over 50% of Italians voted for a validly euro skeptic parties in an expression of rage against the pro European establishment told you okay now one more from them euro skeptic and anti-establishment party five star movement was the largest individual party in the wake of the Italian election results on Monday five star knocked out their competition in de Leeuw and then said five star anyway they are on sensibly on the Left now their populist so it's it's not the same exact lines as you would see in America between liberals and conservatives but they're talking about Universal income that is way to the left of anything in America and they they got the most amount of votes so a lot of people are painting this like the right-wing one in in Italy and you'll see why in a second but that is they didn't get the most votes the left-wing got the most votes so now let's give you more context now from courts on March 4th populist party five star movement won the most votes meanwhile radically xenophobic Northern League overtook center-right party Forza Italia more than half the parliament is now in the hands of upstart populist groups with moderates both left and right of Center crippled exactly as jank couger predicted no that's not in the story okay now let me give you context on how crippled the establishment is in Italy the center-left Democratic Party received less than 19 percent of votes the worst result in its history center-right Forza Italia received around 14% of the votes the worst in leader Silvio Berlusconi's political history now if you take together all the right-wing groups they have more votes than 5 star but 5 stars the most votes overall none of them got to a point where they could form the government on their own so now there's gonna be some it's basically a hung parliament there gonna be some jostling to figure out who could make a coalition and most people assume that the right-wing will band together and make the coalition but you never know I think there's some chance that as the spirit of some of their opinions are 5 star and Northern League can actually join together and do a coalition government and it would be a fascinating populist anti-establishment government if they did so but let me go back to five stars bold progressive proposals this one from Reuters now an explanation its flagship proposal in the election campaign was a minimum monthly income of up to seven hundred and eighty euros for the poor helping to draw overwhelming support in the underdeveloped south guys this is not that complicated if you say to people we're gonna look out for you you're more likely to get their vote Wow shocking or for the for so long especially in America the establishment lost sight of how to get votes in a democracy partly because in America we ended democracy we now we have private financing of our elections so almost all the politicians serve the people who wrote their checks and that's not the public it's private interest as corporations it's incredibly rich people but there are two guys who decided to go populist in the last election in America their names were Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump Bernie Sanders closed a sixty point lead on Hillary Clinton back entirely by the establishment hit Clinton was and she lost that leash she hung on to win the primary and then everybody thought oh of course Hillary Clinton would she's the experienced one she's got all the endorsements I kept saying over and over again those endorsements are counterproductive we don't like the establishment anymore for 4050 years they told us don't just take your medicine and and give us everything and don't worry eventually it'll trickle down to you well it isn't it's not trickling down in Italy it's not trickling down in America and everyone is tired of it so more context here from Reuters anti-establishment parties have been on the rise across Europe since the 2008 financial crisis Italy's mainstream parties have found it especially hard to contain voter anger with the economy still six percent smaller than a decade ago and and on and unemployment stuck at about 11% and in southern Italy tis far far worse so yes no to the establishment because you guys are a little dense people are looking for a change they're so desperate for change they do things as weird and monstrous as putting Donald Trump a clown from a circus as a president of the United States of America and note to all of the parties across the world if you don't have a strong populist left then the voters will chose a populist right and populist right-wing policies but we've seen that movie before in Italy in other parts of Europe and that movie does not end well so give up on the preposterous dream that people will wake up and go oh you know what I think maybe the establishment and the elites have my best interests in mind I'm gonna go vote for them again they're not gonna do it at least give them a reasonable sane populist left alternative so we can go back to representing the people whether it's in Italy the UK European Union or here in America if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member
