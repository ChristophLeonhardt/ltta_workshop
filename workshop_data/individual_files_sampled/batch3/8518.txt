THEY WERE HELD PRISONER BY NORTH KOREA FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. ALL RIGHT. AINSLEY? AINSLEY: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, STEVE. FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG GETTING POLITICAL DURING COMMENCEMENT SPEECH OVER THE WEEKEND ISSUING NEW GRADUATES THIS DIRE WARNING ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF POLITICS. WATCH THIS. AND SO HERE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN EPIDEMIC OF DISHONESTY IN AN ENDLESS BARRAGE OF LIES. THE SEAT IN GOVERNMENT ISN'T SOMETHING TO JUST SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS AT. WHEN ELECTED OFFICIALS SPEAK AS THOUGH THEY ARE ABOVE THE TRUTH, THEY WILL ACT AS THOUGH THEY ARE ABOVE THE LAW. THAT WAS AT RICE UNIVERSITY IN HOUSTON ON SATURDAY. AREN'T COMMENCEMENT SPEECHES MEANT TO UPLIFT AND INSPIRE PEOPLE. HERE TO DEBATE IS OLYMPIC MEDIA UNITED STATES FRANKS AND JASON ANTHONY NICHOLS. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING WITH US. THANK YOU. AINSLEY: LET ME ASK YOU FIRST, I WILL START WITH YOU, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT SPEECH. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST HALF OF IT HONESTLY, I WAS HESITANT. IT SEEMS TO FALL FAIRLY STEREO TYPICALLY COMPARING HIM TO REGIMES. COMPARING HIM TO DICTATORS, THE PRESIDENT, OF COURSE, WHO I'M REFERRING TO. THE SECOND HALF OF IT, ACTUALLY I WAS QUITE HEARTENED BY. BECAUSE I BELIEVE MR. BLOOMBERG IS CORRECT WHEN HE SAYS IF YOUR LOYALTY IS TO LEFT OR TO RIGHT, THEN YOU ARE TAKING TRIBE OVER COUNTRY. THAT, I THINK, IS SPOT ON IN TERMS THE PARTISAN TOXICITY GOING ON IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM TODAY. FIRST HALF NOT GREAT. SECOND HALF PRETTY GOOD. AINSLEY: JASON, WHAT DID YOU THINK IN THE I THINK THE FIRST HALF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT KATIE IS THE EPIDEMIC OF DISHONESTY HE SAYS IS THE WORST THREAT FACING AMERICA NOT TERRORISM AND NOT COMMUNISM OR THE OTHER ISSUES. HE SAID IT WAS THE EPIDEMIC OF DISHONESTY AND SAID POLITICIANS WHO CAN'T TELL THE TRUTH. YOUR THOUGHTS, JASON? I THINK WE ARE IN A SAD MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN EPIDEMIC OF DISHONESTY AND EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE AUTOMATICALLY KNOWS IT'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT HE IS REFERRING TO. I THINK WHAT IS HE TRYING TO TELL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, I THINK CAN YOU GATHER RIGHT NOW THAT CAN YOU REACH SUCCESS BY BEING DISHONEST. THAT YOU CAN EVEN REACH THE PRESIDENCY THAT WAIT A MINUTE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS TOLD 3,000 FALSEHOODS IN UNDER 400 DAYS. SO I THINK WHAT IS HE TRYING TO SAY IS INTEGRITY STILL MATTERS. THAT THE VALUES THAT YOU GOT FROM YOUR MOTHER, WE JUST CELEBRATED MOTHER'S DAY, THAT THE VALUES THAT YOU GOT FROM YOUR MOTHERS THAT WERE REINFORCED IN YOUR CHURCHES AND MOSQUES AND SYNAGOGUES ARE STILL IMPORTANT. AND THEY ARE STILL GOING TO LEAD YOU TO-TO LEAD A SUCCESSFUL LIFE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A NEGATIVE MESSAGE. AINSLEY: KATIE, COMPARE HIS SPEECH TO MIKE PENCE'S SPEECH. HE WAS SPEAKING AT HILLSDALE COLLEGE HE SAID YOU ARE BEGINNING YOUR CAREERS AT A TIME OF GROWING AMERICAN ECONOMY AND RESTORED AMERICAN STATUE AT HOME AND ABROAD. I THINK WE HAVE A SOUND BITE, A CLIP OF THAT SPEECH. LISTEN. ON THE WORLD STAGE, YOU'VE SEEN AMERICA EMBRACING OUR ROLE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. AT HOME BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL ARE GROWING AGAIN. AGAIN BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN ADVANCING THE VERY PRINCIPLES THAT YOU LEARNED HERE IN THE HALLS OF HILLSDALE COLLEGE. AINSLEY: KATIE, COMPARE THOSE TWO SPEECHES. OF COURSE, THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS CERTAINLY MORE OPTIMISTIC AND FORWARD-FACING. I WILL ALSO SAY I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM AT HILLSDALE WHICH IS MY ALMA MATER. I DO THINK THAT IT WAS. I MEAN, AMERICANS AND AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A BETTER PLACE. IT'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO BE AN AMERICAN THAN RIGHT NOW. WAGES, TAX CUTS, JOBS. EVERYTHING IS GETTING BETTER AND CONTINUES TO GO ONWARD AND UPWARD. IT WAS NICE TO SEE HIM REMINDING PEOPLE OF THAT. AINSLEY: JASON, IS IT TIME TO STOP THE IDENTITY POLITICS? WELL, I THINK WE CAN CHALLENGE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT KATIE JUST SAID ABOUT THE TAX CUTS. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GIVE US ANY KIND OF SUSTAINED WAGE INCREASES OTHER THAN JUST ONE-TIME BONUSES. WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT IDENTITY POLITICS. YOU KNOW, DO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE DIVISIONS AND THE FRACTURE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR NATION. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THUS FAR THIS PRESIDENT WE ARE MORE DIVIDED, MORALE IS LOWER IN THIS COUNTRY THAN I CAN RECALL IN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME. I THINK WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED IS A CHANGE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT, YOU KNOW, MR. BLOOMBERG WAS GETTING AT. AND I THINK MR. PENCE IS
