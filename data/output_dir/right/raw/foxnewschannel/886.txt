AND YOUR RESPONSE TO THEM,

122
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:03,339
THE COAST GUARD RESPONSE

123
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,408
REALLY TURNED AROUND IN SOME

124
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:08,244
WAYS A FUNDING ISSUE THAT

125
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:09,913
COULD HAVE BEEN TOUGH FOR

126
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,214
THE COAST GUARD.

127
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,348
THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE

128
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:15,385
INITIALLY CAME IN WANTED TO

129
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:16,019

00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:26,930
WATCH.

138
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,298
IN LAST YEAR'S HISTORIC

139
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,766
HURRICANE SEASON, OUR COAST

LIVES IN THAT SHORT PERIOD.

143
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,008
IT'S AOUN UNBELIEVABLE

144
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:40,543
NUMBER WHEN YOU THINK OF IT.

145
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:40,910
[APPLAUSE]

THAN 11,000, ALMOST 12,000

159
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:58,228
PEOPLE.

160
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,062
THE FIRST RESPONDER IT'S

161
00:03:59,062 --> 00:03:59,996
REALLY NOT ABOUT THE NUMBER.

162
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,397
IT'S ABOUT WHO THAT NEXT

163
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:02,432
