1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:03,403
MIDDLE EAST.

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:04,237
WE ARE STOPPING IRAN.

3
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,773
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO STOP, WE

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,106
ARE STOPPING IRAN.

5
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:10,777
WE TOOK AWAY THE RIDICULOUS DEAL

6
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:11,778
MADE BY THE PREVIOUS

7
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,948
ADMINISTRATION, THE IRAN DEAL

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,485
WHICH WAS $150 BILLION AND $1.8

9
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,520
BILLION IN CASH, WHAT WAS THAT

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,920
ALL ABOUT?

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,623
THEY ARE AN ALLY AND WE HAVE

12
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,159
OTHER GOOD ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE

13
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:26,359
EAST.

14
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,362
SAUDI ARABIA IS AN ALLY AND THEY

15
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,197
ARE A TREMENDOUS PURCHASER OF

16
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,932
NOT ONLY MILITARY EQUIPMENT BUT

17
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:33,432
OTHER THINGS.

18
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:35,468
WHEN I WENT THERE, THEY

19
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,237
COMMITTED TO PURCHASE $450

20
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,073
MILLION WORTH OF THINGS AND $110

21
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,240
BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY.

22
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,376
THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST ORDERS IN

23
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,710
THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY.

24
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,678
PROBABLY THE HISTORY OF THE

25
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:45,979
WORLD.

26
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,581
I DON'T THINK THERE HAS EVER

27
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,816
BEEN ANY ORDER FOR $450 BILLION.

28
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,651
YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY IN SAUDI

29
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,419
ARABIA WHERE THAT COMMITMENT WAS

30
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:53,753
MADE.

31
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:54,654
SO THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT ALLY

32
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,756
BUT I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT

33
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,057
HAPPENED, WHERE IS THE FAULT,

34
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,659
AND WE WILL PROBABLY KNOW THAT

35
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,194
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

36
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,329
MIKE POMPEO IS COMING BACK AND

37
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,831
WE WILL HAVE A LONG TALK.

38
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,900
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MAN

39
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,535
WHO LIVED ACROSS THE RIVER IN

40
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:09,869
VIRGINIA.

41
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,438
WHY NOT SEND THE FBI IN TO

42
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:13,172
FIGURE THIS OUT?

43
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:16,843
>> WELL, HE WASN'T A CITIZEN OF

44
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:17,176
THIS COUNTRY.

45
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:19,712
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR

46
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:23,149
NOT WE HAVE, DO YOU?

47
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,016
>> WELL -- HAVE YOU?

48
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,286
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.

49
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,387
WHY WOULD I TELL YOU?

50
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:31,558
>> YOU ASKED FOR THIS AUDIO AND

51
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,359
VIDEO INTELLIGENCE --

52
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,995
WE HAVE ASKED FOR IT.

53
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:36,429
IF IT EXISTS.

54
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,565
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THEY

55
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,433
HAVE NOT TURNED IT OVER?

56
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,300
>> NO.

57
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,835
I'M NOT SURE IT EXISTS.

58
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:43,603
IT POSSIBLY DOES.

59
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,239
I WILL HAVE A REPORT ON THAT

60
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,774
FROM MIKE WHEN HE COMES BACK.

61
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,909
THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST

62
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,446
QUESTIONS I ASKED.

63
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:58,818
>> THERE WAS TALK ABOUT SPENDING

64
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,553
BEING REINED IN ON CAPITOL HILL?

65
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,089
>> WE WILL ASK EVERY SECRETARY

66
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,158
TO CUT 5% FOR NEXT YEAR.

67
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,126
LAST YEAR, FIRST YEAR, I HAD TO

68
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,094
DO SOMETHING WITH THE MILITARY.

69
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,631
IT WAS FALLING APART, IT WAS IN

70
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,199
VERY BAD SHAPE.

71
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,371
THAT'S WHY WE WENT FOR 2 YEARS,

72
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,739
$716 BILLION.

73
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,442
THAT TOOK PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF

74
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,542
TWO YEARS.

75
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,445
WE HAVE PURCHASED AND

76
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,514
REPURCHASED JETS, MISSILES,

77
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:31,918
ROCKETS, ALL FORMS OF MILITARY

78
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,685
EQUIPMENT, SHIPS, SUBMARINES.

79
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:33,953
WE HAVE REBUILT THE MILITARY TO

80
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,289
A LEVEL THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN

81
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:36,522
BEFORE.

82
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:39,959
I HAD TO DO THAT.

83
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,562
IN ORDER TO GET THE $700

84
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,163
BILLION, THOSE NUMBERS HAVE NOT

85
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,967
BEEN HEARD OF, I HAD TO GIVE THE

86
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,802
DEMOCRATS, I GIVE IT WASTE

87
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,002
MONEY.

88
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,037
THINGS I WOULD NEVER HAVE

89
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,672
APROUFBED BUT WE HAD TO DO THAT

90
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,741
IN ORDER TO GET THE VOTES

91
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,742
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

92
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,010
REPUBLICAN VOTES TO DO THIS

93
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,343
WITHOUT THEM.

94
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,345
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BORDER,

95
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,680
THAT'S BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS

96
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,182
WANT IT TO BE BAD BECAUSE THEY

97
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,817
DON'T GIVE US THE VOTES.

98
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,953
THAT'S WHY I HOPE WE DO WELL IN

99
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:07,654
THE MIDTERMS.

100
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:15,161
BUT WE WILL ASK FOR A 5% CUT FOR

101
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,461
EVERY ONE.

102
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:15,762
OKAY.

103
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,362
WE WILL SEE YOU AT THE CABINET.

104
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:19,432
I WANT TO TALK TO THE GREAT

105
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,467
FOLKS AND WISH THEM BEST WISHES.

106
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,202
THEY HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB

107
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,036
AND WE APPRECIATE IT.

108
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:24,570
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

109
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,573
WE WILL SEE YOU IN A COUPLE OF

110
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:27,806
MINUTES.

111
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:29,542
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE

112
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:35,948
RESPONDING TO A FEW QUESTIONS AS

113
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:38,518
HE IS RESPONDING.

114
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:42,989
HE IS GOING TO ASK SOME CABINET

115
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,293
MEMBERS TO CUT 5% IN THE WAKE OF

116
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,596
A BOOMING DEFICIT, JUMPING 17%.

117
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:51,531
YOU ALSO HEARD CBS RADIO

118
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,565
CORRESPONDENT ASK A QUESTION TO

119
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,134
THE PRESIDENT ON IF HE HAD SEBT

120
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,905
THE SENT THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE

121
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,640
THE WHERE ABOUTS OF U.S.

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,808
RESIDENT JAMAL KHASHOGGI, THE

123
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,943
PRESIDENT NOTED THAT HE WAS NOT

124
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,309
A CITIZEN.

125
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:06,379
AND HE WOULD NOT ANSWER THAT

126
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:06,646
QUESTION.

127
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,348
IN FACT, HE SAID YOU DON'T KNOW

128
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,817
IF I SENT THE FBI OR NOT, MAYBE

129
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,353
I HAVE, I'M NOT TELLING YOU, WHY

130
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,020
SHOULD I?

131
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,624
WE DIDN'T GET CLARITY ON THAT.

132
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,224
HE ALLUDED THAT SECRETARY OF

133
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:21,827
STATE MIKE POMPEO WILL BE

134
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,529

COMING DAYS AND AT THAT POINT,

136
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,234
HE WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE EVIDENCE

137
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,403
THAT HE MAY HAVE OBTAINED FROM

138
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,637
THE TURKISH AND SAUDI OFFICIALS

139
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,873
AND WHERE THE INVESTIGATION

140
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,608
STANDS AT THIS MOMENT.

141
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:40,780
NO MAJOR HEADLINES OUT OF THAT Q

142
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,180
AND A SESSION.

143
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,448
THE PRESIDENT TRUMP NOTED HOW

144
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,317
MUCH OF AN ALLY SAUDI ARABIA HAS

145
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,252
BEEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

146
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,220
THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING

147
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,555
PRESSURE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO

148
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,058
FIRMINATE OR LIMIT THE $110

149
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,292
BILLION ARMS DEAL SECURED WITH

150
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,360
SAUDI ARABIA LAST YEAR.

151
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,062
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE UPDATES AS

152
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,064
THEY COME OUT OF THE OVAL

153
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:58,698
OFFICE.

154
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,565
AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING

155
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,235
WITH HIS CABINET, WE WILL BRING

00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,036
YOU HIGHLIGHTS FROM THAT AS

157
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:04,270
WELL.

158
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,108
AT THIS POINT, WE WANT TO TURN

159
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,043
TO CRIME EA WHERE AT LEAST 18

160
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,980
PEOPLE ARE DEAD INCLUDING THE

161
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,514
ATTACKER.

162
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,516
50 OTHERS WERE INJURED FROM AN

163
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,152
EXPLOSION AND A POTENTIAL

164
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,720
SHOOTING THAT PRECEDING IT ALL.

165
00:05:20,720 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS BEING
