all right welcome the Young Turks Chengdu Granicus pairing with you guys as we shuffle papers heading into the show here all right we got Cavanaugh that's coming up in a minute you guys are all gonna get that and then a little bit later risk us in trouble in Florida Wilbur Ross's truck in trouble on the planet speaking of that the China tariff situation explained a little bit more thoroughly and why it might talk about a global economic collapse it's at least some possibility women that voted for Trump turning on him lots and lots of news in this show of course as always he at the whole show anytime you want become a member of tea or tea complex Jordan alright Castro let's do it let's jump right into it right following attempted rape allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and of course the accuser is Christine Blasi Ford the smear tactics from the right have begun and they have begun aggressively they are relentless and it also includes quite a bit of funding and I'll give you some examples of how it's all going down so first there is the judicial Christ's work this is a group of conservatives who aggressively fight to have pro corporate conservative Supreme Court judges nominated and so they have decided to put one point five million dollars behind a television ad blitz that features a person who has been friends with Kavanagh for 35 years okay so that's the beginning of it also the judicial crisis network has already pledged to spend five million dollars back in Kavanagh so their first ad was released immediately they released it last night Monday night and we have it for you just so you get a sense of the tactics they're planning on using take a look her allegations cover a whole range of conduct from from boorishness and and to ruff horseplay to actual attempted rape and so obviously if you go to if you go to go to rape yes that that is that really serious all right a little technical difficulty there no problem we're gonna get the video for you in just a minute just give me a thumbs up when it's ready all right let's go friends with Brett Kavanaugh for 35 years never thought about doing a TV commercial I'm not involved in politics I'm a teacher I'm a coach I believe that we need to have bright curious open-minded thoughtful empathetic people who are judges and I trust that Brett is that person he's dedicated to his work he's dedicated to his family he said the highest integrity as a person and I believed that he would be a great Supreme Court justice so that add features a teacher who claims to have known him for 35 years the tactic is hey look at all these people who can vouch for him vouch for his character because you know people who have been accused of rape you know everyone has to dislike them throughout their entire lives it's impossible for for that person to have a group of people in their personal lives that like them and respect them while they could also in their you know in private do things like attempted rape so I think the substance of that is pretty weak a lot of people like to OJ - that didn't mean he didn't do it he's a very likable guy outside of murdering two people so but I think the more important part of this is that's fascinating so five million dollars are gonna they have announced other they're gonna spend one and a half they've already put into TV ads where's the money coming from is it concerned citizens who are genuinely pro-life and they care about that and they think Cavanaugh is prologue is it genuine citizens who think no I I know I don't know anything about Cavanaugh being against Roe versus Wade because that's the official Republican stance right I just think he's such a wonderful principal jurist that I am looking forward to to having him confirming our Supreme course I'm gonna give five bucks ten bucks twenty seven bucks to make sure I run these ads to new no no the funny thing is it has nothing to do with the hot-button topics that you're seeing now the ad is funded by very wealthy people and corporations because Cavanaugh is massively Pro big business so they need his vote in there not for Roe versus Wade not for anything else they need it to make sure that they he advances advances a pro corporate agenda so those donors are like oh he is accused of attempted rape whatever role in the five million dollars let's get this guy in the court so he could rule against our employees all day long that's what's being played here you think five million dollars materializes out of nowhere for this know there's people who think I'm gonna make a buck off of Cavanaugh being on the Supreme Court yeah absolutely any and he is a pro corporate judge his past rulings and decisions prove that and the fact that they were able you know this this organization the judicial crisis network was able to get this funding secured so quickly tells you something there are people who are worried about their bottom line at the end of the day rape doesn't matter attempted rape doesn't matter his character doesn't matter the rulings that he might have in regard to social issues or women's health doesn't matter it doesn't matter and by the way the judicial crisis network is just one organization that includes people that are now attacking Ford and her allegations there's also a dennis prager and he wrote an op-ed for the National Review that was disgusting and so I'm gonna give you a few of the excerpts let's go to graphic 62 Prager who once called the idea of college rape culture a gargantuan lie argues at his piece for National Review that the allegations against Cavanaugh should be ignored because they tell us nothing about Brett Kavanaugh since the age of 17 so there's two different parts that one is the general the core rape culture being a gargantuan lie you know I I don't know what he means by that but I know what he encourages by that he encourages people the guy it's not a big deal just don't worry don't spend too much time on it so when victims asked for more protections from universities don't sweat it it's all a lie it's all a lie so that's a terrible thing to spread the second part of it is him saying look this happened when he was 17 doesn't tell us anything about him being 53 then actually I find to be the least offensive of all the defenses of Kavanagh but hold he's gonna get to really really offensive in a second um I disagree with you I think attempted rape at any age says something about a person right no I'm gonna see what doesn't I'm saying of all their defenses of Kavanagh that's the least offensive do you see what I'm saying because there's low bar yeah I hear you it's a low bar but look we've had this discussion before so if if he was accused of this a year ago when he was 52 well it's a no-brainer everybody knows that he's responsible for it if he was accused when he was as we talked about on Friday show I believe 12 well that's the difference situation when he was 12 so I think that their best defense is well 17 is closer to 12 than it is to 52 I don't it doesn't mean that I believe in that defense but the other defenses are way way worse because they are they're saying like out what happened to her is not that big a deal and that preggers about to make those arguments the judicial crisis Network spokespersons about to make those arguments on CNN I think those are horrific arguments they should go nowhere near them which only leaves them this or she's just made it up entirely I think that's there otherwise they got nothing so in this National Review piece he also writes this is another example keep in mind like this is what he's focusing on here this is another example of the moral chaos sewn by secularism and the left okay let's stop for a second by the way Dave Rubin you should feel really proud of yourself for working for this guy that's the problem secularism is the problem yeah the chaos owned by secularism is the problem you don't think that it's problematic that someone who might be the new Supreme Court justice in the highest court in the country might have carried out attempted rape you don't think that that's the problem you think that secularism is the problem I mean but get a load of that inverted logic where they live in the upside down so he's like if the people were more religious they would realize that charges of attempted rape are no big deal he's arguing that craigers arguing that that is the moral position the immoral secular left position is attempted rape is a big deal okay look you make your own decision on which one you think is moral and which one is not moral but the way that they turn things on their head is amazing somehow he's made it so the moral position is supporting attempted rape okay but look look keep going keep going I'm telling you it's it gets really really really bad in any society rooted in judeo-christian values it is understood that people should be morally assessed based on how they behave over the course of their lifetime early behavior being the least important period in making such an assessment okay so I I have a billion things to say about this first of all I gotta go back to the whole secular is it so you don't believe in secularism do you believe in the Constitution so do you think that we should be forced to believe a religion like what does that even mean guys like the what drives me crazy about the right wing is that they respect guys like Prager because it's such a low bar it like most of the people in the party are total morons like Donald Trump and George W Bush so when somebody with a pulse shows up they're like Dennis Prager oh my god he's got a university where he teaches how bad the secular left is but think about how irrationally is on every front to Anna's point there you don't believe in secularism so you think what church and state should be combined that religion should rule us but Prager you're Jewish I Got News for you your religion isn't gonna win and I've got further news for you because apparently even though you've got a whole University you've named after yourself let's just note how obnoxious that is and the other guy who did that was Donald Trump anyway historically which you've apparently never studied when Christians or any religion rule over Jews and other minorities it doesn't end well when they say have use my religion to rule and by the way you're in a minority religion have you studied any history do you know how that ends oh yeah I got a great idea let's make sure that we don't do secularism we combined church and state cuz I'm one of the dumbest guys alive okay so let's get to the second part of that excerpt that is insane so look I don't I don't care if he did this at 17 for me it doesn't matter because guess what normal people don't do at the age of 17 attempted rape right so it's one thing if hey when I was 17 I decided to drink and get behind the wheel and I got caught in a DUI like if that was an allegation against Brett Kavanaugh I'd be like okay come like we've all made a mistake let's move on this is attempted rape okay yeah this is different from any other youthful indiscretion that people could be accused of so look a DUI obviously is very serious and and that's why it's an important and interesting conversation etc and and that's why we said in the beginning if you're gonna go back to high school it's got to be a high bar it doesn't get much higher than attempted rape and in in terms of some of the attacks against Kavanagh they're all pointing to how he used to admit to drinking a lot in high school look for people who are looking to corroborate professor Ford's story that he was stumbling drunk that is relevant for people looking to say he was a bad guy in high school for over drinking that is not relevant I want to be clear because they're gonna set up straw man arguments we don't care that he drank too much we care about what he did on that day when he drank too much and and allegedly did the attempted rape that's what we care about not about the drinking so but for God's sake let's get to his mom and his wife and what he thinks so he tries to make it seem like you know getting groped is not that big of a deal that you know people and his personal life had to deal with it and they handled it just fine my mother was groped by a physician she told my father about it my father told the physician that if you were to do that again he would break his hands and then he talks about his wife let me get to this because this gives you even more detail into his way of thinking he says when my wife was a waitress in her mid-teens the manager of her restaurant grabbed her breasts and squeezed them on numerous occasions she told him to buzz off figured out how to avoid being in places where they were alone and continued going about her job that's empowerment no it's not no it's not so you think the right approach for my god your mom and your wife is when men grab their breasts there should be no consequences there should be no legal consequences that's not sexual assault that the most the consequences should be hey I told them to buzz off know that the onus is on the woman right because if your if your manager or higher up in the company that you're working for gropes you and makes you uncomfortable tell him to buzz off and then the onus is on you to avoid contact with him the onus is on you to make sure you're not in a room alone with him that's the what part of that is empowered as a clown and he'd notice he said his wife was in their mid-teens which so she was what 14 15 16 years old and this guy's constantly sexually assaulting her at work he puts that as a positive example of come up what's the big deal everybody played with my wife's breasts when she was a teenager everybody played with my mom's breasts what's the big deal man they just brushed it off but even if you don't think that's a big deal and there's something really weird and off about you if you don't think that's a big deal but remember that those things often lead to the guy not buzzing off but being encouraged that no cops were called and that there were no real consequences and leading to much more serious things it reminds me of the Roy Moore story where he kept hitting on a teenager who was a waitress at a restaurant he used to frequent and then one day he tricked her into getting in the car according to the allegations and then started ripping her clothes off or forcing her head down onto his lap oh well there goes your buzz off strategy dennis prager what a brilliant thing that was hey dennis prager if somebody comes and punches you in the face why don't you just tell them to buzz off what's the big deal man up Dennis man up what if oh god these days when everybody wants to go to the police and actually press charges on assault or attempted rape on the good old days we just spit on it right I remember those days our coach was tell us you get hurt just spit on it right now I don't want anybody punching tennis Praeger I don't want anybody doing anything physical but the these guys they're a pourraient I knew that they would go to the bottom of the barrel and immediately they're like what's I mean he's basically saying so he pinned her down tried to rip off her bathing suit held her mouth closed down while his friend turned up the volume so they couldn't hear her screams what's the big deal why don't you just tell them to buzz off that's who that is fragrance any right winger who looks up to dennis prager I feel sick to my stomach for you because they're so embarrassing that's the intellectual of the right wing it's pathetic so uh finally another part of his op-ed I guess touches on what he thinks if these allegations are true even if true what happened to her was clearly wrong but it tells us nothing about Brett Kavanaugh since the age of 17 but for the record I don't believe her story if the whole set up is who cares if it's true at the very very end he says by the way of course I don't believe her sir why what basis do you not believe her story so for example we explained in the beginning we don't know more evidence came out then we explained hey listen she talked to her therapist the therapist wrote down the notes in 2012-2013 that's a good reason to believe her there's least some evidence it's hard to know what happened on that day we're trying to have a reasonable assessment of the fact scenario his it reasonable assisted a believer but so what if it happened so what if he tried to rape a 15 year old what's the big deal Wow that is quite intellectual of you so there's one final component to this story and you know I'm sure that there are more smears happening as we speak as we do this video but there was an individual who appeared on CNN her name is Cary Severino and she's with the judicial crisis Network the same you know group that we talked about earlier and she had an interesting way of describing the allegations take a look her allegations cover a whole range of conduct from from boorishness and and for to rough horseplay to actual attempted rape and so obviously if you go to if you go to go to rape yes that that is that that is a really serious allegation it's any I don't think anywhere in there she's saying this is boorish horseplay at all in her life I think that's at all she's certainly implying that that it that it's attempted rape but I think you have to look at it there's there's a 30 so five years of memory that we're trying to play with here and I'm saying that the just the behavior she described could be interpreted described a whole range of things I don't hurt I know her perception of it was one it was one way I'm just saying I think I think we have to get all of the facts that said judge Cavanaugh says this didn't happen at all so under any interpretation he says no that I was not in a party like that this didn't happen Wow Carrie you really need to work on your spin you know skills because you were really struggling there weren't you yeah well because they have to have a woman go out and say it so they're like hey hair you drew the short straw go out and defend attempted rape well how are we gonna do that well look you're gonna have it in the range of options so that you don't seem like the worst person on earth you don't seem like you're Dennis Prager but in there you're gonna inject talking points and we're gonna test them out remember judicial Christ network as we explained earlier funded by these huge and it's all secret corporate and and and really rich donors who want Kavanagh on the court for their own financial purposes and so they're like hey listen you're paid to do this for us so describe the attempted rape as quote rough horseplay and what they do is they send out somebody to do that first and then if it works and people like it then they repeat it and then it becomes a talking point oh it's just rough horseplay it was just rough horseplay and you'll see it over and over and over again that was them testing it up I Got News for you that test didn't work so it is you could tell from the reaction of the anchor at the time who's kind of taken aback by it the reaction online our reaction and person's reaction you could have left it at hey it's so hard to know what happened on that day 35 years ago no you had to inject that talking point and when you characterize attempted rape and covering a woman's mouth while trying to rip her clothes off is rough horseplay well it harkens back to well that's not torture that's just you know enhanced interrogation and those aren't detention centers what were they calling them family residences or something along those lines so no it's not rough horseplay and and it's sick that you're being paid to say that to see if you guys can get people to believe that it wasn't what it actually was well apparently according to the allegations in America you can pay anyone to say anything doesn't matter so let's take a break when we come back some of trumps reactions to this story and then later in the show we will touch on the u.s. relationship with China following this whole tariff and trade war we hope you're enjoying this free clip from The Young Turks if you want to get the whole show and more

candidates you like and the ones that you dislike and make a difference by donating or at least just getting the news about them so down-ticket calm okay now I wanted to read one quote from a member here that they sent in earlier this is atheists snail so already we're having fun or atheistic snail I should say just sign up as an activist member without the TYT Network in my online atheist community I would be depressed into inaction by current events instead I'm motivated and excited to fight for progressive secular values Thank You TYT you've earned my support and my respect oh that's weird Dennis Prager thinks that your secular values are sowing chaos in the country the kind of chaos that might actually prevent rape you a dyd DICOM slice joining become a member the speaking of which let me read a couple of quick member comments for you a lot of people talking about community here so quasi rights in I'm so excited that I finally made it to home from work in time to watch live the only downside is that I have nothing to look forward to tomorrow at work that's funny you guys seriously get me through the day it's so refreshing to know that there is a community of people will actually care about fixing what is broken in our country instead of just putting a bandaid on it well we're right here for you no question Tamra 5:17 says super excited to watch live I've been an activist member for over a year and I've wanted to participate forever to keep it simple thank you for giving me a gym to work out the muscle that is my brain love you guys Thank You Tamra this really really you and last one here Paul Sullivan says funny how none of this matters since he was in high school hmm almost almost like the black young men in prison for life for nonviolent crimes are different people from when they were 17 thank you strange that it doesn't apply to them too yeah so you know that triggered an interesting idea if the Republicans say yeah he might have done it but he was 17 maybe we can have a deal if you release everyone in prison who got caught for doing something when they were 17 you want to make that deal by the way I don't I don't even know if I really want that I mean no of course when it comes to drug offenses I agree wholeheartedly but rape and murder are serious like serious crimes and 17 is different from 12 so yeah no of course I don't want that deals some of the people that would be released would are worthy about released some people are that committed terrible terrible crimes and 17 are probably potentially still dangerous so but it makes no sense to have two different standards right so that's a great point by Paul as well all right what's next Anna all right Donald Trump continues to support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and even though Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committee are calling for the FBI to do an investigation to either confirm or find some information about whether or not these allegations against Cavanaugh are true Trump says that it's unlikely that the FBI will conduct the investigation now part of the reason why is the FBI can't do that unless the White House signs off on it and Trump has been clear in saying that he's not gonna sign off on it now before we get to that though I do want to show you the messaging from Trump that will be repeated over and over again and it is to attack Democrats rather than address the real allegations lodged against Brett Kavanaugh take a look judge Cavanaugh is one of the finest people that I've ever known never had even a little blemish on his record I wish the Democrats could have done this a lot sooner because they had this information for many months and they shouldn't have waited till literally the last days they should have done it a lot sooner but with all of that being said so you would have thought certainly that she would have brought it up at the meeting not wait till everything's finished and then have to start a process all over again but with all of it being said but again this is something that should have been brought up long before this they had the information in July as I understand it it's very you know it's very unfortunate that didn't mention it sooner but with all of that being said again this should have been brought up a long time ago thank you okay no no we didn't repeat any of that he does the endless repetition by himself and he keeps saying with all that being said that's why jr. left that in there because he's supposed to get to the actual point but he can't help himself and in fact when asked about attacking the Democrats that other time he's like well well we're not gonna I'm not gonna do that today I might do it in a couple of days okay well what difference does it make that and he says which you couldn't you help yourself and and a good and fair question that we've been asking for a couple of days now is you're claiming okay that's what some Democrats knew how about the Republicans right how do they have that letter ready of 65 women that knew Kavanagh back when he was in high school how'd they have that done in 24 hours seems like they knew to Mitch McConnell why did he warn you not to appoint Kavanagh in the first place as an appointed out days ago did Mitch McConnell know so those are good at important questions Democrats you should be asking those questions too now in terms of the FBI getting involved Senate Democrats have been clear in that they don't they're not calling for a criminal investigation they are calling for the type of investigation by the FBI that was conducted when Anita Hill came forward with her allegations against Clarence Thomas - you know if Cavanaugh didn't do it maybe there's a way to clear his name they just want this to be investigated and they want the FBI involved and Trump doesn't see willing to get the FBI involved now remember he doesn't seem to have much love for the FBI in the first place but the Justice Department released an interesting statement they said the allegation does not involve any potential federal crime the FBI's role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision-makers okay so the DOJ acknowledges that the investigation would be for information so people can use that information to either confirm or vote against Kavanaugh but they don't want to do that either and then Trump address this as well during his press conference and here's what he had to say we have time available we will delay the process until it's finished out I guess we've invited everybody I know I can tell you this that Judge Cavanaugh is anxious to do it I don't know about the other party but Judge Cavanaugh is very anxious to do it and a delay is certainly acceptable I don't agree I really should be involved because they don't want to be involved if they want it to be I would certainly do that but as you know they say this is not really their thing really I I haven't seen anything from the FBI indicating that they don't want to be involved in this the only thing I have seen from the FBI is a statement indicating that they can't do the investigation unless the White House sanctions it well I mean this is a man who thinks cooperating with federal law enforcement maybe should be outlawed so it's unsurprising that he doesn't want federal law enforcement involved in actually gathering evidence so of course the FBI said no such thing and it's not that complicated it's true it's not a federal crime the FBI is not investigating to arrest Kavanaugh or anything yeah it might be a state crime but not a federal one it's but the FBI does background checks this is the most important background check there is this is exactly what they did is an appointed out with an ADA Helen Clarence Thomas so why wouldn't you just apply the same standard or are you afraid what they would find and then one final thing is Mark judge who was allegedly the other person in the room when this attack happened says that he does not want to testify before the Senate specifically the Senate Judiciary Committee both dr. Ford and Cavanaugh have agreed to testify however mark judge says no I did not ask to be involved in this matter nor did anyone ask me to be involved the only reason why I am involved is because dr. Christine Blasi Ford remembered me as the other person in the room he also says in fact I have no memory of this alleged incident Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but do i but I do not recall the party described in Ford's letter so his defense so far has been I don't remember I have no recollection I think that's an interesting way of handling it there hasn't really been a flat-out denial oh no there was there was yesterday he so it went like this he at first he said I have no recollection then he said no it's absolutely nuts so he called it nuts yeah but today it's interesting that he went back to man I don't recall and remember he's written books about his struggle with alcoholism etc that might be one reason why he doesn't recall or it might be that he's like mm-hmm what if they get other evidence so it's easy for me to say I don't recall I was been drinking at the time right so of all people I think Meghan Kelly made an interesting point yesterday when she said why would dr. Ford put my judge a friend of Cavanaugh in the room if she made it up if you're gonna make up a story you wouldn't put a corroborating witness for him in the same room and dr. Ford's a 51 year old professor just not if she and again she'd have had to make it up in 2012 when she talked about it earlier so none of that adds up one more thing at least judge was sophisticated enough to say I don't remember it if I was at a party like that Orrin Hatch screwed up while defending Cavanaugh and recently said Cavanaugh told me in a meeting that he wasn't at that party wait a minute she never said which party she never said which date so then people were like what do you mean this was Cavanaugh was Kevin I know the party that she's referring to and then orrin hatch two spokespeople had to go no no no Cavanaugh didn't say that to us he said that he doesn't remember being at a party like that what is a party like that even mean by the way you don't recall being at any party that where you were drunk people where people were going swimming when you were 17 years old in the summer okay so that little backpedal I thought was a little telling too and again these guys seem to have known for a long time that this might become an issue how would they know it was gonna become an issue if they never heard from her that means they might have heard from him and if they heard from him then she's clearly not making it up let's take one more break in this hour when we come back we will talk about China there's a lot that isn't really being reported so we'll go into those details and then later on some of the women who voted for Trump now possibly regretting their decision that's a really interesting story all right for all the members you're gonna get the whole show whenever you want obviously for some of you the episode ends here but remember there's a whole two-hour show make sure you get that anytime you want by becoming a member Qi t.com / joint all right we'll be right back
