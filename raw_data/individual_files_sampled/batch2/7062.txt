there is one progressive lawmaker who is pushing for a system that would help Democratic candidates who want a medicare-for-all system and that representative is Pramila giant Paul she is a Democrat out of Washington and she has created a political action committee something that we will usually have negative commentary toward here on this show but this political action committee is very different from the super PACs that help to corrupt our political system now representative Jay Paul is founding a political action committee to contribute money to congressional candidates who support single-payer health care commonly known as Medicare for all in fact she gave a quote saying the following the goal is to really lift up and support candidates who are excited about and supporting the idea of Medicare for all it's really that simple and it turns out that Medicare for all does have support among some Democrats in Congress right now it has the support of more than one third of the Senate Democratic caucus and also a majority of House Democrats and also the former President Barack Obama belatedly just the other day very belatedly yeah okay so now let me give credit to some other PACs first of all promo jayapala czar justice Democrat one of the three incumbents who are super proud of her super proud of this proposal which I think is borderline genius I'll explain why in a second secondly the just Democrat Organization pressured a lot of those House Democrats in the first place to sign up for Medicare fraud it was not a majority when when just Democrats started campaign in every single district to try to pressure those Congress people into it and now it's a majority of Democrats in the house that's a big big difference especially as the Democrats of Mike take over the house now Medicare for all as we said from day one and we were right and people like congresswoman jayapal were right is deeply popular that is what the American people want they can't stand their health care costs anymore and the stress that comes with not knowing whether their family is going to be protected or not so great credit to that now well I start a Wolfpack and that was to get money out of politics it's not a single issue and the idea there was we can use the flaw in the system against it so we'll raise money and vote out anyone that doesn't vote for getting money out of politics it's a trip I hate but it works and in fact in places where we've done it in Connecticut and Maryland the other side is how old and they say well how could you want to get money out of politics but you're spending all this money on people that voted against you well we said well there's one way to fix that you get money out of politics that I can't spend it okay so that's wolf dash pack.com but this is I hadn't thought of it all and I want to give jeyapaul and everybody that worked on it tremendous credit because the minute I read I was like oh my god why didn't we think of this earlier because in this case if you love medicare-for-all as 70% of the country does then you give money to the politicians that are for Medicare for all and guess what's gonna happen soon you're gonna have more politicians who are for Medicare for all it begins then even the odds so that's why it's borderline genius and also this political action committee is seeking small dollar donations this is different from a super PAC that Lockheed Martin gives money to to get you know Lindsey Graham re-elected it's just it's and by the way another really important distinction from from this political action committee and other efforts that we're seeing is that they they are only going to help politicians who specifically say no Medicare for all no nonsense about okay the first we're gonna we're gonna support the first step which is you know what Barack Obama did you know okay the Affordable Care Act we're gonna maybe expand Medicare coverage maybe lower the age and which people are eligible for many they don't want to fund any of that they don't want any part of those politicians they're only going to help support politicians who specifically say that they want a Medicare for All system period no John Paul's not playing yeah right she's like no you don't get to be cute here you either for Medicare for all period or you don't get any of the money if the money drives politicians well okay then let's raise money for this issue I think you can go issue-by-issue look and by the way I want to be a make sure that you guys know the website is past medicare-for-all dot org we'll have a link down below in the description box later if you're watching on YouTube or Facebook and go help them pass medicare-for-all org so look it's one thing when I start in 2011 a pack and it's you know an online show doing the best they can and for whatever reason it's hard for people to understand give money to an organization to get money out of politics that throws it for a loop I don't think it's that complicated but it does it's another thing when and it's sitting incumbent says you want this issue of pack it past well what's the number one way to get issues past by giving money to politicians it sucks that that system exists so give money to wolf pack to get rid of it but as it currently exists well if we raise a ton of money and my guess is that this is gonna raise a lot of money and then we give it to only politicians that will vote for a medicare-for-all Tutu's is my ex-girlfriend used to say all of a sudden you're gonna have a lot of politicians for Medicare for all before they're getting money from the pharmaceutical companies and the health insurance companies etc so that created a natural incentive to go as Larry Lessig says great professor from Harvard who's the Godfather of getting money out of politics movement he says the politicians follow the green okay so they see that money and they go run towards it it's always the same thing they lean towards the green he says and in this case well okay now we got the green okay if you guys donate to it etc and I'm my guess is correct that they'll raise a lot of money and I guess all of a sudden all those politicians will lean to the green yes absolutely and I just want to leave this with with some some facts about what's happening with our current health care system because there was a story that I found really important unfortunately we didn't have time to do a video on it but I want to share some of the statistics so there is a record number of elderly people filing for bankruptcy during their retirement years during their retirement age and part of the reason why I'm big reason why is because unaffordable health care here in the United States so there have been a number of studies done but one of the more recent studies indicates let's go to graphic 55 the rate of people 65 and over filing for bankruptcy grew nearly two hundred and four percent from 1991 to 2016 and the percentage of seniors among all US bankruptcy filers increased by nearly five times over that same period and one of the main causes again was high health care costs and then reduced income obviously because they are retired and there's the decline of pensions but the biggest issue is health care people get sick if they get sick with a chronic illness they're screwed under this system no I'm telling you man I talked to politicians every day and I talked to reporters who talk to politicians all the time and right now what they're getting back from the American people is a giant scream of please stop this this health care issue is killing us literally in the case of health care and they're done with it they're up to here with it so they need a solution and and unfortunately Obamacare wasn't it it was not a half measure it was a quarter measure right and a certainly Trump's solution of getting rid of the quarter measure and going back to the terrible system which still dominates is not an answer and people are beginning to understand that so that their this Medicare for all thing might happen much quicker than you realize and then you move on an issue number two you could do this again and again and again right so the second biggest issue I'm hearing from all of those politicians knocking on doors talking to average Americans across all parties student debt so in Washington they barely want cable news to a barely barely talk about it cuz they're all millionaires and they're like student debt I paid that off you know immediately right so but everybody else in the country said albatross around their neck let's do Medicare for all and let's go issue by issue okay well you know what would be best to get the money out first okay and then that makes everything much easier so go
