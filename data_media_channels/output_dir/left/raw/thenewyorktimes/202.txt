1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,719
It’s moving day at
the New York Aquarium.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,820
These workers are transporting
sand tiger, sandbar

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,440
and nurse sharks
into a new permanent exhibit

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,780
called “Ocean Wonders: Sharks!”

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,110
“It will be a
mixed species exhibit

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,670
in which you’ll have
large-bodied individuals

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,700
and then you’ll have large
schools of smaller fish.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,890
We also have 
a sea turtle in there.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,390
All these species
found right here

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,360
in New York as part
of our own wildlife fauna.”

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,670
The exhibit has been in
the works for over a decade

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,500
and was delayed
many years by damage

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,170
from Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,409
But moving these
animals isn’t easy.

15
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,700
“People think it’s either like,
oh, you just grab them up

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,350
like you do with
goldfish in a bag

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,900
or it’s some sort of
shark rodeo

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,160
where you wrestle them in.

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,140
And the truth is, it’s
a very well-thought-out,

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,375
precision operation.”

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,740
First, the shark needs to
be corralled into a sling.

22
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,671
It sometimes takes a few tries.

23
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,505
“Beautiful.”

24
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:07,605
“You got my back, Jeff?”

25
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:08,125
“Yup.”

26
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,075
“Rope, rope.”

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,220
After the shark is
lifted out of the water,

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,640
it’s time for a short
ride to his new home.

29
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,559
Before they join the
rest of the fish,

30
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,350
they get a checkup.

31
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,501
“[unclear] and open the drain valve.”

32
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:25,487
“Hold on.”

33
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:28,000
“Hold on.”

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,784
“We don’t get our hands
on these sharks very often,

35
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:33,200
so we want to get things like
weight, we want to get length,

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
we want to get girth.

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,470
We take blood draws

38
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,993
because we’re doing any number
of assessments of the health.”

39
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:39,793
“All right, drop him down.”

40
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:41,380
“Down.”

41
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,990
Finally, the ordeal is over.

42
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,240
“Come on, big guy.”

43
00:01:47,950 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s time to settle in.
