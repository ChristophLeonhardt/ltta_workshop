Mexican immigrants are no question being targeted by ISIL fischels under the trump administration but if you could recall Trump said that he would specifically root out and target undocumented immigrants who were guilty of committing crimes however case after case provides evidence that that is not what's happening and recently Mexican immigrants from South Jersey who have actually been in the United States for three decades we're just deported even though they haven't committed any crimes even though they are actually business owners and even bought a home in New Jersey Oscar Campos is Oscar couples and his wife Berta composts are the couple or is the couple that has been deported they even have four children that were born here in the United States 24 22 and 16 years old I'm sorry they have three children they're deported back to Mexico even though they had petitioned to stay again they hadn't committed any crimes whatsoever in their nearly 30 years of living in the United States the couple purchased a home and had a landscaping business the two oldest children are also college graduates so there were no issues with them whatsoever but it didn't matter ice officials wanted them out and that's exactly what they got yeah as I look at a story like that I I wonder if the right wing looks at that and celebrates and I think the answer is yes so when you see him hugging his daughter and he signed over a power of attorney to one of the older siblings so they can take care of the 16 year-old who's still in high school a sophomore in high school and take care of the home's mortgage and them and the business etcetera but do they cheer I guess so they go yeah we got him this guy who had been here for 30 years and he ran here for freedom because there was a violence in his hometown in Mexico and he believed in America and he came here and he settled in New Jersey my home state and led a great productive life started a business employed other people and and when we route him out and leave his kids behind and send him back to Mexico our right winger's thrilled I guess so I guess they're really really happy like we tore that family apart mission accomplished great work well what's really interesting is that oftentimes when you hear the right-wing talk about undocumented immigrants you know they have a very different depiction of them they have a different narrative and that narrative is the same narrative that you heard from Trump during the election that they're criminals and they're rapists and they're dangerous but oftentimes especially immigrants who have been here for decades they are job creators they owned a landscaping business they employed other people they had successful kids who graduated from college they're not doing anything negative here in the United States of anything they're they're beyond productive they're creating those jobs but you know unfortunately we allowed that anti-immigrant propaganda to seep into society so successfully that you know now we're unfortunately doing more harm than good no one's making an argument that we should deport criminals right people who are here and they're undocumented but they're causing problems they're committing crimes everyone agrees they should be deported but in this case I don't understand why our resources our resources are being used to deport these people they actually hurt the local economy so you know I know that if you're right when you got sold a bill of goods and maybe you enjoyed buying them but in me or maybe you didn't know but you really think that guy was the cause of your problems because you have problems you do so that's what the TV doesn't acknowledge and the politicians don't acknowledge and that's why you're mad and I don't blame you for that right so minimum wage is $7.25 you can't live off that you'd have to have two jobs to even get the 30,000 that you're in 80 hours a week to give a $30,000 a year so did they suppress your wages yes they most certainly did okay you think it was that guy in New Jersey who set up a landscaping business that suppressed your wages that's the lie they told you no it was the donor class who told the politicians I'm writing you a check now what you're gonna do is make sure you do not increase the minimum wage make sure you don't have workplace safety you deregulate all of our businesses and you make sure that you'll lower corporate taxes and in this next outrageous tax cut bill increase taxes on the middle class and that's what they're gonna do that is what they're gonna do and so my question is at what point are they going to realize that they continuously vote against their best interest because not only do they think that immigrants like the one that we just profiled for you are the the root of all their problems they also believe that you know things like minimum wage regulations or regulations in general are hurting them when in reality no no deregulating has hurt you keeping wages stagnant is something that these corporations have wanted cutting taxes for these corporations historically has not created more jobs in fact they've been very honest about the fact that they're gonna take that money that they're gonna save from these tax breaks and these tax cuts and they're gonna go ahead and buy their own stocks or or give their CEOs bigger bonuses how is that going to help you as a worker who's down in the dumps who's maybe having a hard time getting employed I mean and that's another thing during the election you will perfectly describe how things how things go how things have happened historically with all of these terrible right-wing policies and they reject it and call you elitist so okay at what point are you gonna accept after all of these policies in the Trump administration pass at what point are you gonna accept that you voted against your best interests so I hear from libertarians especially but a lot of right-wingers said oh no if you just take away all the rules anarchy is awesome and and so you will magically get higher wages like for example if you take minimum wage well there is one place in the country I know it's unique in a little different case but there is one place where there is no minimum wage allowed that's prison you know what the wages are they're as low as eight cents an hour what happened to no no if you just take away regulation the wages will go up now they're in prison I get it it's a different scenario right but no they drove them down to eight cents not eight dollars eight cents an hour to a dollar a day that's what they drove them down to because if they can get away with it they will drive your wages to rock-bottom until well until we're all in metroid servants we can look at case studies that are happening right now as we speak what about countries that don't have the right and the workers protections that we have here in the US right so manufacturing jobs in other countries whether it be India or China are they paying their employees a livable wage are those employees happy are they I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe they're super happy maybe all those people who jumped off the buildings at Foxconn did it because they were so elated with how much they're getting paid that they couldn't contain themselves they jumped off that building I mean come on it's just so incredibly short-sighted and it's beyond frustrating to continuously explain this over and over again people don't get it so again but vote against your best interests how about it what one lassie you really think that Oscar and Umberto composts are the ones who set the rules in America and set the rules against you that they were so powerful that that's why you either lost your job or you've been downsized to a job that barely pays you working living wages or could it be the donors who bought off the politicians and that the composters are in the same situation you are struggling to make ends meet and provide for their family you're called to make I guess if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come
