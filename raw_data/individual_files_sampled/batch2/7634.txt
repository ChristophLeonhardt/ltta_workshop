I want to focus on a small part of the interview that Donald Trump had with the New York Times is rambling and saying interview one I want to give him a little bit of credit there was one thing that he did say that was right so he said that he has been in his word soft on China because he was hoping that they they would help with the negotiations with North Korea and he said oil was going to North Korea Korea and that wasn't my deal he's right that actually would have been a decent policy pressure China to crack down on North Korea and you got to do some negotiate in there and it looked like he was and and I think that China is not holding up their end of the deal so that's that's fair and I wanted to be point out the one right thing that he did say in the interview but then he of course can't help himself because he's Trump so they asked him about his visit with President Xi Jingping and he said that the president quote treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of China not kidding that's his exact quote well it's true it's absolutely true no one in the history of China has ever been treated just this well why would you question that why would you question I mean how do you begin to break that down how would you know how every person has been treated throughout history what a preposterous thing to say he's insane and why is that a bragging point by the way why is that a good thing like if the leader of China is treating you that well maybe that's like you should be worried or a little cognizant of that saying hey she trying to get something out of me it cetera it fits into his narrative that he is the most beloved respected individual that's ever existed ever like it's just that it just plays in that narrative and look a person who has to constantly repeat those types of things about themselves knows that it's the antithesis of reality Muhammad Ali's entire thing was you know I'm the greatest I'm the greatest fighter of all time Muhammad Ali would be like wow this guy brags a lot Mohammed Ali is an idol of mine I got his picture and his quotes up in my office a lot of people are you guys see it on the YouTube live videos I do sometimes but what I love about Ali is that it was always tongue-in-cheek from absolutely no kidding and arguably in the ring he backed it up it was believe me when you got in the ring and he hits you five times before you saw the first one coming that's where surprise said like I didn't even see it coming he hit me five times you know he was the greatest of all time and and most beloved that's Rice beloved and but the reason people liked him is because he had a smile on his face as he said those things right and it not only could he back them up but it was it was in good spirits right whereas Trump's like I am the greatest all right and I no one knows accounting better than I do no one knows tax is better than I do my favorite and it's no one else noticed it but I we played every once in a while on this show is not it so my favorites is the Puerto Rico surrounded by is an island surrounded by water big water ocean water anyway but in Bay in Puerto Rico when he threw the paper towels at people and you know the victims of of the hurricane and later when he was asked about he said they were big beautiful towels they were just going with paper towels wrapped it had these beautiful soft towels very good towels beautiful they were incredibly normal paper towels okay because everything has to be extreme everything has to be grand anything that Trump touches in the case literally of the paper towels has to be the best thing that's ever happened and and guys even if you're a die-hard Magga dude like really do you believe those are big beautiful soft towels wrapped in the normal plastic okay do you believe that he has been treated better than anyone has ever been treated in the history of China I think this is something that the people who've had to work with and around him not like directly but you know like you know maybe secretaries or waiters or this at-at or you know maybe their tutors for his kids or something they're all sitting around saying see now you know what we listen to every day right this has been my life all you know submit they're like yeah now you know what it's like to be in this household to be in this world because you know this didn't just start you know that everything he's done and you and if you're in that position you have to just stand there and listen to him say that this is the greatest this is the biggest this is these are the softest paper towel how long have you want to say you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
