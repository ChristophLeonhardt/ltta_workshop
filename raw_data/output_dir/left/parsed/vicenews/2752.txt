no faking the body holies killing
innocent nonsense
we're driving towards the north side of
st. Louis there was another police
shooting there today this is something
we've been hearing about all week police
shootings are particularly common
there's been a lot of movement in
Ferguson over to the death of Mike Brown
but we're gonna see how communities and
other parts of the city are reacting to
this
you know that mid-city chance
they say stole so either scores
one time car the police the young man
but at the same time the young man got
on the ground
yeah like the little smile Liberty nine
o'clock this is my head small so he was
on the ground crews on the ground it was
too white
this can't be happening every day we
wake up a person that they can take our
the Taser billy club mace will be really
my scene

police
I see all their face beep oh I came by
to right over there right down the
sidewalk when I walked it was a war
he chose the spot exactly what happened

around he's like what happened Michael
Brown in Ferguson gonna try and actually
dr. police now they've been standing in
here there were quite a few people got
an outside into this place
not everybody seems to kind of figure

what happened here today
I went back to believe there was some
issue about I was standing out here in
front and they were all over my and so
store owners here and saw the other
witnesses caller please the officers
responded and at some point there was a
the officers were in close proximity to
the person and the person who shot both
officers
I do know a lot of we've seen there's
been a lot of looting back in Ferguson
for the past week are you worried that
something like that is gonna happen
yeah as a black many females also
happens to be a police officer what do
you think about all that people are
saying about racial issues and the
police and kind of segregation is the
newest and police racism I certainly
can't discount people's experience when
they say that there's a lot of places
and relational issues and there's
potential in particular communities
there's always aspera concerning the
rear that is kind of disappointed you
can ask a few questions
sounds like in the felicity I know if
Thalia like in the conversations that
I've seen for Janina my family
it's a dangerous area yeah holiday rush
yeah
some people that turn out races are they
racist against Arabs
Martin planet yeah that's the way I
would like you see in Ferguson they were
