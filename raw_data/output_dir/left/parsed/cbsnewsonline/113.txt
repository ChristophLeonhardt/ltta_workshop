ABOUT LATELY, HOW HE IS 
CORRECTING THE TRADE IMBALANCES.
MAKE YOU CAN SEE THE BIG BOARD 
IS OPEN AND WALL STREET IS SORT 
OF TAKING IT ALL IN 
ESSENTIALLY. 
YOU ARE NOT SEEING A HUGE 
INCREASE, ALTHOUGH THAT MAY 
CHANGE, OBVIOUSLY, IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TRADING DAY. 
I THINK IT WAS WHAT WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WITH 
KATIA DMITRIEVA  THIS IS GREAT 
NEWS IN THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT 
TO ADDRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS HAS 
HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
SECOND QUARTER. 
THE QUESTION IS, IS IT 
SUSTAINABLE. 
THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN GROWING 
SINCE, OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
LAST FEW YEARS. 
>> NINE YEARS OR SO. 
>> A LOT OF MEASURES HAD BEEN 
TAKEN -- PUT INTO PLACE SUCH AS 
THE INTEREST RATE WHICH IS SORT 
OF GOOSING THE ECONOMY. 
WILL THE TAX PLAN AND THE 
TARIFFS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
IMPOSED ON SOME OF OUR TRADING 
PARTNERS, WILL THAT HAVE AN 
UPLIFTING EFFECT OR AN ADVERSE 
EFFECT? 
MANY BELIEVE IT WILL BE AN 
ADVERSE EFFECT IN THE MONTHS 
AND PERHAPS EVEN YEARS AHEAD. 
GENERALLY, THAT'S HOW TARIFFS 
WORK. 
THEY USE -- THEY USUALLY DAMPEN 
THE ECONOMY. 
THAT'S WHY SO MANY 
CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT FOR THESE 
TARIFFS, INCLUDING THE SPEAKER 
OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN AND 
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY. 
THEY IN FACT, BELIEVE THEY ARE, 
IN SOME WAYS, ATTACKS ON THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A 
BACKGROUND IN FINANCE, VLADIMIR.
SOME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THE 
FEAR OF THE TARIFFS, THAT SOME 
PEOPLE MAY HAVE MADE HEAVY-DUTY 
PURCHASES THEY MAY NOT HAVE 
MADE, IN ANTICIPATION THAT IT 
WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO 
PURCHASE THE THINGS THEY NEED. 
THAT MAY BE WHAT WE ARE SEEING 
HERE. 
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, AS MAJOR 
GARRETT POINTS OUT, THE 
PRESIDENT ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL, AND EVEN AFTER HIS 
INAUGURATION, TALKED ABOUT HOW 
HE EXPECTED THE ECONOMIC 
POLICIES THAT HE WOULD PUT INTO 
PLACE WOULD LEAD TO A STRONGER 
AND HIGHER GDP. 
I'M SURE HE'S GOING TO ADDRESS 
THAT AT SOME POINT IN HIS 
SPEECH HE'S GOING TO MAKE TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHICH IS 
THAT HE'S GOING TO SAY THAT 
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MOVES THAT 
HE HAS MADE THAT WE ARE 
STARTING TO SEE THIS GDP GROWTH.
IT'S EVERY PRESIDENT'S 
PREROGATIVE TO TELL THE ECONOMY 
WHEN THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL. 
EVERY PRESIDENT HAS DONE IT 
GOING BACK TO THE VERY FIRST 
PRESIDENT. 
THE QUESTION, OF COURSE, 
BECOMES IF THIS IS NOT 
SUSTAINABLE, THEN WHAT DO 
YOU.TO AS THE REASONS FOR THE 
LACK OF CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE 
QUARTERS AHEAD. 
THE MARKET IS ONLY UP ABOUT 38 
POINTS RIGHT NOW. 
THAT'S BECAUSE, I THINK, WALL 
STREET HAS MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT 
THIS. 
AS THEY LOOK AHEAD, THEY ARE 
PERHAPS WORRIED THAT THIS WILL 
HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE 
ECONOMY AND ON PEOPLE'S 
POCKETBOOKS IN THE QUARTERS 
AHEAD. 
TO THE BIG HEADLINE YESTERDAY, 
MAYBE NOT THE BIG ONE BUT ONE 
OF THE HEADLINES, WAS ABOUT THE 
DEFICIT AND THE FACT THAT THE 
GOP TAX LAW, THE TAX CUTS MAY 
RESULT IN A HUGE BOOST IN THE 
DEFICIT, UP TO $1 TRILLION. I'M 
SURE THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE 
TO PIVOT BACK TO SOMETHING MORE 
POSITIVE. 
YOU ARE RIGHT. 
THIS IS GOOD NEWS. 
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO LET PEOPLE KNOW 
WHAT'S HAPPENING. 
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE, ALSO, IF THE PRESIDENT IS 
JOINED BY WILBUR ROSS OR LARRY 
KUDLOW, SOME OF THE ADVISORS HE 
HAS BROUGHT ONTO HIS TEAM TO, 
IN HIS MIND, HE WAS PART OF THE 
FACT THAT HE WAS BRINGING SOME 
OF THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST IN 
FINANCE IN THE WORLD OF 
FINANCE, FROM WALL STREET, TO 
GIVE HIM IDEAS AND INPUT INTO 
WAYS TO MAKE THE ECONOMY GROW. 
I'M SURE, THAT'S ONE OF THE 
THINGS HE'S GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT, THE PEOPLE HE HAS 
BROUGHT ONTO HIS TEAM INCLUDING 
CABINET SECRETARIES WHO HAVE 
CONTRIBUTED, BASED ON THEIR 
IDEAS, TO THIS TREMENDOUS 
GROWTH THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE 
SECOND QUARTER. 
WE ARE STILL -- WE WERE TOLD 
THERE WAS A TWO-MINUTE WARNING. 
YOU CAN SEE THE PRESS HAS 
GATHERED THERE. 
THE PRESIDENT, AS I SAID, IT'S 
THE PREROGATIVE OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
TO TALK ABOUT POSITIVE GROWTH, 
STRONG GROWTH, BECAUSE IT DOES 
AFFECT ALL AMERICANS. 
I'M SURE HE WILL GET, IF HE 
TAKES ANY QUESTIONS, HE WILL 
GET SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT 
ARE BREWING, INCLUDING MICHAEL 
COHEN, WHO WIN JUST THE COURSE 
OF ONE WEEK, RELEASED AUDIO 
TAPE OF HER RECORDING HE MADE 
OF A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH REGARDS TO 
PAYMENTS MADE TO A FORMER 
PLAYBOY PLAYMATE, KAREN McDOUGAL
. 
>> I DON'T THINK YOU ARE 
ELEVATING HER, GIVING HER A 
PROMOTION SHE DOESN'T DESERVE. 
TO AS YOU CAN SEE, WILBUR ROSS 
IS THERE AND I'M SURE HE'S VERY 
HAPPY TO HAVE HIM ON HIS TEAM. 
ALSO STEVE MNUCHIN IS THERE AS 
WELL. 
MY EYES ARE GETTING OLD. 
>> IT'S A TINY SCREEN. 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT VLADIMIR. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD SOME 
RECENT WINS AND THIS IS ONE. 
WE HAVE NEWS OF THE POSSIBLE 
REMAINS OF AMERICAN 
SERVICEMEMBERS IN THE KOREAN 
WAR BEING RETURNED. THAT'S A 
WIN. 
AND A MEETING WITH THE EU, I 
THINK, WAS ALSO A WIN. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN THAT 
THE TARIFFS WOULD HAVE AN 
INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON 
FARMERS, IN PARTICULAR. 
HE HAS PROMISED TO DEAL, IN 
PARTICULAR, WHEN IT COMES TO 
SOYBEAN FARMERS. 
THERE'S A LOT OF THE THINGS FOR 
THE PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT. 
YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE'S ALSO THE 
SCANDALS BREWING. 
>> AND HERE IS THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES ALONG WITH 
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> GOOD MORNING. 
MOMENTS AGO, THE NUMBERS FOR 
THE AMERICAS ECONOMIC GROWTH OR 
GDP -- AMERICA'S ECONOMIC 
GROWTH, OR GDP, WILL RELEASE. 
I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT IN 
THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS 
YEAR, THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY 
GREW AT THE AMAZING RATE OF 4. 
1 PERCENT. 
WE ARE ON TRACK TO HIT THE 
HIGHEST ANNUAL AVERAGE GROWTH 
RATE IN OVER 13 YEARS. I WILL 
SAY THIS RIGHT NOW AND I WILL 
SAY IT STRONGLY, AS THE TRADE 
DEALS COME IN ONE BY ONE, WE 
ARE GOING TO GO A LOT HIGHER 
THAN THESE NUMBERS, AND THESE 
ARE GREAT NUMBERS. 
DURING EACH OF THE TWO PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS WE AVERAGE JUST 
OVER 1.8% GDP GROWTH. 
WE ARE NOW ON TRACK TO REACH 
GDP ANNUAL GROWTH OF OVER 3% 
AND HE COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY 
OVER 3%. 
EACH POINT, BY THE WAY, MEANS 
APPROXIMATELY $3 TRILLION AND 
10 MILLION JOBS. 
IF YOU GO UP ONE POINT, THAT 
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT 
IT'S A LOT. 
IT'S $3 TRILLION AND ITS 10 
MILLION JOBS. 
IF ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES AT 
THIS PACE, THE UNITED STATES 
ECONOMY WILL DOUBLE IN SIZE, 
MORE THAN 10 YEARS FASTER THAN 
IT WOULD HAVE UNDER EITHER 
PRESIDENT BUSH OR PRESIDENT 
OBAMA. 
PERHAPS, ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
WINS IN THE REPORT, AND IT IS 
INDEED A BIG ONE, IS THAT THE 
TRADE DEFICIT, VERY DEAR TO MY 
HEART BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN 
RIPPED OFF BY THE WORLD, HAS 
DROPPED BY MORE THAN $50 BILLION
, $52 BILLION TO BE EXACT. 
THINK OF THAT. THE TRADE 
DEFICIT HAS DROPPED BY MORE 
THAN $50 BILLION. 
THAT IS ADDING 1.2 GDP. 
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS DROP. 
WE HAVE NOT HAD A DROP LIKE THAT
IN A LONG TIME. 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK A 
LONG TIME BEFORE YOU FIND THAT. 
BY INCREASING GROWTH 3% OVER 
THE NEXT 10 YEARS, THAT WOULD 
MEAN 12 MILLION NEW AMERICAN 
JOBS AND $10 TRILLION OF NEW 
AMERICAN WEALTH, AT LEAST. 
THAT'S NOT INCLUDING THE FACT 
THAT SINCE I WAS ELECTED, WE 
HAVE CREATED APPROXIMATELY $7 
TRILLION OF NEW WEALTH. THE 
YEAR BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE, 
PRIVATE BUSINESS INVESTMENT 
GREW AT ONLY ONE .8% -- 1.8%. 
LAST YEAR GREW BY 6.3%. THAT 
WAS MY FIRST YEAR AND THERE 
WERE A LOT OF THINGS WE HAVE TO 
DO TO MAKE IT GROW. 
THIS YEAR IT'S GROWING AT 9.4 
PERCENT -- 9.4%. THERE HASN'T 
BEEN AN INCREASE LIKE THAT IN 
MANY YEARS, DECADES. 
LARRY KUDLOW JUST CONFIRMED TO 
ME THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE VERY 
SUSTAINABLE. THIS ISN'T A ONE 
TIME SHOT. 
I HAPPEN TO THINK WE ARE GOING 
TO DO EXTRAORDINARILY WELL IN 
OUR NEXT REPORT NEXT QUARTER. 
I THINK IT'S GOOD TO BE 
OUTSTANDING. I WON'T GO TOO 
STRONG BECAUSE THEN IF IT'S NOT 
QUITE AS GOOD, YOU WILL NOT LET 
ME FORGET IT. 
I THINK THE NUMBERS ARE GOING 
TO BE OUTSTANDING. WE HAVE 
ACCOMPLISHED AN ECONOMIC 
TURNAROUND OF HISTORIC 
PROPORTIONS. WHEN I CAME INTO 
OFFICE, 1.5 MILLION PRIMATE 
AMERICANS WERE WORKING VAN 
EIGHT YEARS BEFORE. 
WE LOST ALMOST 200,000 
MANUFACTURING JOBS UNDER THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND YOU 
ALL KNOW. THEY SAY YOU HAVE TO 
LOSE MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
IT WILL GET WORSE AND WORSE. 
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE 
OBSOLETE. 
THEY ARE NOT OBSOLETE. 
THEY ARE THE GREATEST JOBS WE 
HAVE. 
MORE THAN 10 MILLION ADDITIONAL 
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO 
FOOD STAMPS IN PAST YEARS. WE 
HAVE TURNED IT ALL AROUND. 
ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE THE ECONOMIC 
ENVY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. WHEN 
I MEET THE LEADERS OF 
COUNTRIES, THE FIRST THING THEY 
SAY INVARIABLY IS, MR. 
PRESIDENT, SO NICE TO MEET YOU. 
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR 
ECONOMY. 
YOU ARE LEADING THE ENTIRE 
WORLD. 
THEY SAY IT ALMOST EACH AND 
EVERY TIME. AMERICA IS BEING 
RESPECTED AGAIN AND AMERICA IS 
WINNING AGAIN BECAUSE WE ARE 
FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 
EVERYWHERE WE LOOK, WE ARE 
SEEING THE EFFECTS OF THE 
AMERICAN ECONOMIC MIRACLE. WE 
HAVE ADDED 3.7 MILLION NEW JOBS 
SINCE THE ELECTION. 
A NUMBER THAT IS UNTHINKABLE, 
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN, 
NOBODY WOULD'VE SAID IT. NOBODY 
WOULD'VE EVEN, IN AN OPTIMISTIC 
WAY, PROJECTED IT. 
WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE 
LONGEST POSITIVE JOB GROWTH 
STREAK IN HISTORY. 
NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS HAVE 
RECENTLY ACHIEVED THEIR LOWEST 
LEVEL. 
THAT'S THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 
ALMOST A HALF CENTURY. 
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS ACHIEVE 
THE LOWEST LEVEL IN RECORDED 
HISTORY. AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE BEST IT HAS 
EVER BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
THE HISPANIC AN EMPLOYMENT RATE 
HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL, 
LIKEWISE, IN HISTORY. 
THE ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS 
RECENTLY REACHED THE LOWEST 
LEVEL, AGAIN, LIKEWISE, IN 
HISTORY. 
WOMEN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE 
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 65 
YEARS AND SOON THAT WILL BE IN 
HISTORY. 
GIVE IT ANOTHER TWO OR THREE 
WEEKS. 
VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT ITS 
LOWEST LEVEL IN 18 YEARS AND 
THAT NUMBER IS RAPIDLY GOING UP
, ON TOP OF WHICH WE JUST 
RECEIVED FROM CONGRESS, CHOICE 
WHERE VETERANS CAN GO OUT AND 
SEE A DOCTOR IF THEY CAN'T GET 
SERVICE, THE SERVICE THEY 
DESERVE. 
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR DISABLED 
AMERICANS HAS HIT A RECORD LOW, 
LOWEST IN HISTORY, MORE THAN 
3.5 MILLION AMERICANS LIFTED 
OFF OF FOOD STAMPS, SOMETHING 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN DECADES. 
3.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 
LIFTED OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. 
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE 
TO GO OUT AND GET A JOB AND 
THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE THEIR 
JOBS. 
95% OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS 
ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR 
COMPANY'S OUTLOOK. THAT'S THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL, ALSO, IN 
HISTORY. 
THAT'S AN OLD SURVEY. 
THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG 
TIME. 
MANUFACTURING WAGES ARE 
EXPECTED TO RISE AT THE FASTEST 
RATE IN OVER 17 YEARS. 
BUSINESS AND CONSUMER 
CONFIDENCE HAS REACHED HISTORIC 
HIGHS. SO FAR THIS YEAR, 
AMERICAN EXPORTS ARE UP NEARLY 
20%. I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A 
LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AND A 
HALF. 
OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN THE 
YEAR BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE, WE 
HAD TO BECOME A NET EXPORTER OF 
NATURAL GAS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE 1957. WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF 
REGULATIONS WHICH ALLOWS US TO 
DO THINGS. 
WE STILL HAVE TREMENDOUS 
REGULATIONS ON CLEAN-AIR, CLEAN 
WATER, THE ENVIRONMENT. 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO 
EVERYBODY. 
BUT WE HAVE NECESSARY 
REGULATIONS THAT WERE HURTING 
OUR ECONOMY AND HURTING OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE ELIMINATED A RECORD 
NUMBER OF JOB KILLING 
REGULATIONS, AND WITH THE HELP 
OF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, WE 
PASSED, WITHOUT ONE DEMOCRAT 
VOTE, THE BIGGEST TAX REFORM IN 
HISTORY. 
AND AS YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS WANT 
TO REFORMAT AND RAISE 
EVERYONE'S TAXES. 
THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR 
OUR ECONOMY. 
AS A RESULT, MORE THAN 6 
MILLION AMERICANS ARE NOW 
ENJOYING NEW BONUSES, BETTER 
JOBS, AND FAR BIGGER PAYCHECKS. 
YET EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT VOTED 
AGAINST THE TAX CUTS, EVERY 
SINGLE ONE. 
WE DIDN'T GET ONE SINGLE VOTE. 
THEY VOTED AGAINST WORKING 
FAMILIES. 
THEY VOTED AGAINST SMALL 
BUSINESSES. 
NOT GOOD! 
IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS AFTER 
TAX CUTS, OVER $300 BILLION 
POURED BACK INTO THE UNITED 
STATES FROM OVERSEAS. 
WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN 
THE END, WHEN COMPLETED, OVER 
$4 TRILLION THAT WILL BE BACK 
INTO OUR COUNTRY. 
APPLE ALONE IS BRINGING IN $213 
MILLION -- $230 BILLION AND 
BUILDING A MAGNIFICENT CAMPUS. 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING 
THEIR MONEY VERY WISELY. 
THEY ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY 
IN OUR COUNTRY, NOT IN SOMEBODY 
ELSE'S COUNTRY. 
THAT WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE 
NEW TAX CUT AND REFORM PLAN. 
AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE 
FINALLY CRACKING DOWN ON 
DECADES OF ABUSIVE FOREIGN 
TRADE PRACTICE. WE WERE ABUSED 
BY COMPANIES. 
WE WERE ABUSED BY THE COMPANIES 
WITHIN COUNTRIES, BUT IN 
PARTICULAR, WE WERE ABUSED BY 
COUNTRIES THEMSELVES, INCLUDING 
ALLIES. WE WERE ABUSED LIKE NO 
NATION HAS EVER BEEN ABUSED ON 
TRADE BEFORE BECAUSE WE HAD 
NOBODY WATCHING. THEY STOLE OUR 
JOBS AND PLUNDERED OUR WEALTH 
BUT THAT ENDED. 
YESTERDAY I WAS AT GRANITE CITY 
STEEL IN ILLINOIS, AN 
INCREDIBLE SIGHT. 
WE HAD SOME OF THE ROUGHEST AND 
TOUGHEST PEOPLE YOU HAD EVER 
SEEN AND THEY HAD TEARS ROLLING 
DOWN THEIR FACES. 
HALF OF THEM HAD TEARS GOING ON 
BECAUSE WE OPENED A TREMENDOUS 
UNITED STATES STEEL PLANT. THEY 
ARE OPENING UP SEVEN OTHER 
PLANTS AND THE STEEL INDUSTRY 
IS BACK. 
THEY ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 
WE NEED THE STEEL INDUSTRY. 
THE TARIFFS DID IT. NOBODY 
MENTIONS THE FACT THAT THESE 
PLANTS ARE CREATING TREMENDOUS 
NUMBERS OF JOBS, TREMENDOUS. 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE POURING 
INTO THE UNITED STATES COFFERS, 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
WE ARE GETTING JOBS. WE ARE 
GETTING MONEY COMING IN. 
WE ARE RESPECTED. EVENTUALLY 
THE STEEL PRICES WILL REALLY 
START TO GO DOWN BECAUSE ALL OF 
THESE NEW PLANTS WILL BE 
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER. 
WE DON'T HAVE CORN -- WE DON'T 
HAVE FOREIGN COUNTRIES DUMPING, 
THAT'S WHERE THEY USE, DUMPING, 
DESTROYING OUR PLANS AND 
COMPANIES AND DESTROYING OUR 
JOBS. SINCE I WAS ELECTED WE 
HAVE ADDED 400,000 NEW 
MANUFACTURING DEALS. 
REMEMBER, THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO 
BE OBSOLETE. 
I USED TO SAY, WHY IS IT 
OBSOLETE. 
WE HAVE TO MAKE THINGS. 
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE THE ROOT 
OF OUR COUNTRY. 
THE INDIVIDUAL MULTI-IS GONE 
FROM OUR HEALTHCARE. 
THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO PUT 
MORE MONEY FORWARD FOR THE 
PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING THAT 
INSURANCE. 
THAT WAS THE MOST UNPOPULAR 
PROVISION BY FAR, PROBABLY ON 
ANYTHING, BUT CERTAINLY IN 
OBAMACARE. 
OBAMACARE IS ON ITS LAST LEG, 
FORTUNATELY. 
THROUGH ASSOCIATED HEALTH 
PLANS, WE ARE GIVING AMERICANS 
THE ABILITY THINK OF THAT. 
IT WILL COST US NOTHING. 
SECRETARY ACOSTA, SECRETARY A 
CZAR, AND -- AZAR, BETTER 
HEALTHCARE WILL COST OUR 
COUNTRY NOTHING. 
WE ARE FINALLY TAKING CARE OF 
OUR PEOPLE. 
FINALLY THERE'S ANOTHER MATTER 
THAT IS OF PROFOUND IMPORTANCE 
TO ME, AND I WISH TO DISCUSS IT 
BEFORE WE LEAVE. THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE LIVES OF 
AMERICANS, AND LIVES ALL OVER 
THE WORLD. 
AT THIS MOMENT, AND AIRPLANE IS 
CARRYING THE REMAINS OF SOME 
GREAT FALLEN HEROES FROM AMERICA
BACK FROM THE KOREAN WAR. THEY 
ARE COMING BACK TO THE UNITED 
STATES. MIKE PENCE, OUR 
WONDERFUL VICE PRESIDENT, WILL 
BE THERE TO GREET THE FAMILIES 
AND THE REMAINS. I WANT TO 
THANK CHAIRMAN KIM FOR KEEPING 
HIS WORD. 
WE HAVE MANY OTHERS COMING. 
I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN KIM, 
IN FRONT OF THE MEDIA, FOR 
FULFILLING A PROMISE HE MADE TO 
ME. I'M SURE HE WILL CONTINUE 
TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE AS THEY 
SEARCH AND SEARCH AND SEARCH. 
THESE INCREDIBLE AMERICAN HEROES
WILL SOON LAY AT REST ON SACRED 
AMERICAN SOIL. EVEN DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE WOULD COME UP 
TO ME, A LONG TIME AGO, MANY 
DECADES AGO, OFTENTIMES OLDER 
AND IN SOME CASES YOUNGER. MY 
GREAT-GRANDFATHER, MY 
GRANDFATHER, MY FATHER, THEY 
ASKED IF I COULD DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT. 
I WOULD LOOK AT THEM AND SAY, 
WE DON'T GET ALONG TOO WELL 
WITH THE COUNTRY. 
THEY SAID, WHATEVER YOU CAN DO. 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO ME. 
MANY PEOPLE A VAST, I'VE ASKED 
THE -- MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED. 
I HAVE ASKED THE VICE PRESIDENT 
TO PAY A SPECIAL TRIBUTE AND 
THEY WILL DO THAT. 
WE HONOR THE SACRED MEMORY OF 
EVERY INCREDIBLE AMERICAN 
PATRIOT WHO FOUGHT AND DIED IN 
THAT WAR. 
IN EVERYTHING WE DO AND EVERY 
ACTION WE TAKE, WE ARE FIGHTING 
FOR LOYAL, HARD-WORKING, 
PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF OUR 
BLESSED NATION. WE ARE MAKING 
OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE 
RESPECTED AGAIN ALL OVER THE 
WORLD. OUR MILITARY WILL SOON 
BE STRONGER THAN IT HAS EVER 
BEEN, BY FAR. THAT IN ITSELF 
WILL PRODUCE THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF JOBS. NOBODY MAKES 
EQUIPMENTS LIKE WE DO, NOBODY, 
WHETHER IT'S PLANES OR MISSILES 
OR ANY FORM OF MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT. 
WE MAKE THE BEST IN THE WORLD, 
BY FAR. 
WE ARE MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR 
OUR ALLIES TO BUY THAT 
EQUIPMENT QUICKLY. 
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR TWO 
YEAR APPROVALS, AND MORE. 
WE ARE DOING GREAT! 
I'M VERY HONORED TO SEE THAT 
4.1% NUMBER. 
PERHAPS I AM EVEN MORE HONORED 
TO SEE THE DEFICIT  SHRINK, THE 
TRADE DEFICIT SHRINK SO MUCH. 
WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO ASK THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF 
ECONOMIC ADVISERS AND MY VERY 
GOOD FRIEND, LARRY KUDLOW, IF 
THEY COULD STEP FORWARD MUCH MR 
PRESIDENT. 
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
LEADERSHIP AND FOR THE FAITH 
THAT YOU PUT IN ME. 
WHEN YOU OFFERED ME THIS JOB. 
AND THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP 
FOR OUR VETERANS. 
MY FATHER AND MY UNCLE BOTH 
FOUGHT IN THE KOREAN WAR. 
MUCH IT MEANS TO THOSE VETERANS 
THAT YOU DIDN'T FORGET THEIR 
COUPLE ADDS. 
YOU KNOW -- COMRADES. 
YOU KNOW AS AN ECONOMIST SIR 
IT'S MY DUTY SIR TO REMIND THAT 
WE SHOULD NOT MAKE TOO MUCH OF 
ONE NUMBER RIGHT? 
HOW OFTEN DO ECONOMISTS SAY 
THAT IS THIS BUT WHEN I HAY -- 
SAY THAT? 
BUT WHEN I THEY BACK TO THE 
FIRST TIME I MET YOU IN THE 
OVAL AND MAKING AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
IN THE END I AGREED YEAH THAT 
STUFF REALLY OUGHT TO WORK. 
THE FACT IS THAT IF WE LOOK AT 
THE DATA TODAY THAT WE CAN SEE 
THE PROOF IN THE PUDDING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES ARE 
WORKING AND NOT JUST IN THE TOP 
LINE BUT IN THE DETAILS. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID IF WE 
DEREGULATE THE ECONOMY AND HAVE 
A -- THE FACTORIES WILL COME 
BACK TO AMERICA. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, THEN 
-- FACTORIES ARE -- WE COULD 
BECOME A DOMINANT ENERGY 
ECONOMY EVEN AN ENERGY 
EXPORTER. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA TODAY 
ONE OF THE REASON WHY IT'S SO 
STRONG IS THAT DRILLING AND 
MINING ACTIVITIED SKYROCKETED 
AND AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED 
WAY. 
FINALLY THIS IS THE THING AT 
TIMES SIR, YOU SAID YOU WOULD 
PRETHE TRADE DEFICIT DOWN AND 
THE YOU HAVE -- BRING THE TRADE 
DEFICIT DOWN AND YOU HAVE. 
THE $50 BILLION REDUCTION 
PROVES THAT IF YOU STAND UP FOR 
AMERICA'S WORKERS AND LET THE 
ALLIES KNOW THAT DEALS THAT ARE 
UNACCEPTABLE, THAT YOU CAN MAKE 
A LOT OF PROGRESS. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
LEADERSHIP SIR AND THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR FAITH IN ME. 
>> GREAT JOB. 
>> THANK YOU SIR. 
THANK YOU SIR. 
IT'S A LITTLE WARM OUT HERE SO 
I'LL BE AS QUICK AS I CAN. 
I WANT TO REITERATE WHAT 
PRESIDENT SAID AND MY PAL KEVIN 
HASSET. 
LOOK, WE'VE HAD A PRO GROWTH 
AGENDA. 
AND IT HAS BEEN IF PLACE FOR A 
-- IN PLACE FOR A SHORT WHILE. 
IT IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO 
WORK. 
LOW TAX RATES ROLL BACK OF 
REGULATIONS, UNLEASHING ENERGY 
AND TRADE REFORM TO FIX A 
BROKEN WORLD TRADING SYSTEM. 
I JUST WANT TO NOTE IN THE 
NUMBERS AND THIS IS BECOMING A 
TREND, BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS 
BOOMING. 
9% TO 10% GROWTH IN THE FIRST 
HALF OF THIS YEAR, I BELIEVE 
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE. 
WHY DO I TALK ABOUT BUSINESS 
INVESTMENT? 
WELL, THAT'S THE KEY TO 
PRODUCTIVITY WHICH IS THE KEY 
TO GROWTH. 
WHICH IS THE KEY TO RISING REAL 
WAGES. 
AND VERY STRONG JOBS, A POINT 
THAT KEVIN AND I MADE DURING 
THE CAMPAIGN A MILLION TIMES 
AND WE CONTINUE TO MAKE IT. 
THESE TAX CUTS PARTICULARLY ON 
THE BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT 
SIDE ARE GOING TO BE BOOSTING 
WAGES LIVELIHOODS AND JOBS FOR 
MIDDLE AMERICAN ORDINARY 
WORKING FOLKS. 
AND IT'S STARTING TO TAKE 
EFFECT AND THAT'S WHY I AGREE 
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
THIS IS A BOOM THAT WILL BE 
SUSTAINABLE. 
FRANKLY AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN 
SEE, THIS IS NO ONE SHOT 
EFFORT. 
SO THAT'S ME. 
THANK YOU SIR. 
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. 
 
>> THANK YOU LARRY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
>> ALL RIGHT THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES VERY PROUD 
RIGHTFULLY SO MANY POINTING -- 
THIS POINTING OUT THE 
TREMENDOUS -- IN POINTING OUT 
THE TREMENDOUS GROWTH THE 
UNITED STATES' ECONOMY 
EXPERIENCED OVER THE COURSE OF 
THE SECOND QUARTER. 
4.1%. 
IT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
GROWTH GDP GROWTH RATE IN QUITE 
SOME TIME. 
SINCE 2013. 
>> YEP. 
>> AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT HE AND THE MEMBERS OF HIS 
ECONOMIC TEAM ARE VERY PROUD 
OF. 
THERE'S PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA 
THAT ARE ADDING ME AND SAYING 
YOU KNOW, WE AS REPORTERS 
SHOULD BE -- MORE LAUDATORY 
TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT FOR THIS 
ACCOMPLISHMENT. 
>> IT'S A TREMENDOUS 
ACCOMPLISHMENT AND THE 
PRESIDENT SHOULD -- SHOULD LET 
US KNOW ABOUT IT. 
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, WE ALSO 
WANT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT TOO 
AND THAT'S WHY WE ASKED YOU 
KNOW ABOUT HOW LONG IS THIS 
SUSTAINABLE AND WHAT ARE WE 
GOING TO SEE FOR THE REST OF 
THE YEAR BUT THIS IS GREAT 
NEWS. 
S. 
>> GREAT NEWS FOR THE 
PRESIDENT. 
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE IS 
TALKED ABOUT FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME. 
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE 
CAMPAIGNED ON WHICH IS HE HAD 
TALKED OFTEN TIMES ON THE 
CAMPAIGN TRAIL ABOUT INCREASING 
THE GDP NUMBERS. 
LOOK I SPENT 20 YEARS ON WALL 
STREET. 
ANYTIME YOU CAN POINT TO A WIN, 
IT'S GREAT. 
BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES FOR 
EXAMPLE IN MY SITUATION, FOR 
OUR CLIENTS, IS IT SUSTAINABLE? 
AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 
THINGS OVER THE COURSE OF AN 
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. 
AND THREE MONTH BLIP ON THE 
ECONOMICALLEN CAR, DOES NOT -- 
ECONOMIC CALENDAR DOES NOT MAKE 
AN ECONOMY. 
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES IT'S 
SUSTAINABLE AND THE NEBRASKAS 
OF THE -- MEMBERS OF THE 
ECONOMIC COUNCIL ALSO BELIEVE 
NUMBERS ARE SUSTAINABLE. 
PERHAPS THEY'RE RIGHT. 
THE THING IS YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
THE STOCK MARKET RIGHT NOW. 
THE MARKET REACTING SORT OF 
SIDEWAYS ABOUT THIS. 
THE DOW JONES IS UP SLIGHT BUT 
BUT WE NOTICED -- SLIGHTLY BUT 
WE'VE NOTICED THE AND P IS DOWN 
AND' -- S&P IS DOWN AND 
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF VOLATILITY 
IN THE TECH CENTER. 
TWITTER IS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY 
AND ENERGY IS ALSO TAKING HIT 
AS HAS FACEBOOK. 
FACEBOOK IS -- YOU KNOW BEEN 
CRUSHED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
DAYS AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE 
REASON WHY WE'VE SEEN SOME OF 
THE VOLATILITY IN THE S&P AND 
THE NASDAQ. 
THE QUESTION OF COURSE BECOMES 
AS WE LOOK FORWARD AND WE SPOKE 
TO KATIA WHO -- WHO WORKS AT 
BLOOMBERG AND WE TALKED TO HER 
ABOUT AND WE ASKED HER 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS CAN BE 
SUSTAINABLE OVER THE COURSE OF 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS. 
AND THE QUESTION, IT'S NOT A 
DEFINITE. 
BUT THE QUESTION THAT EVERYONE 
HAS IS BECAUSE THAT -- SOME 
PEOPLE, SOME FOLKS HAVE 
STOCKPILED SOME OF THE GOODS 
THAT ARE -- THE PRESIDENT HAS 
IMPOSED TARIFFS ON. 
>> PARTICULARLY SOYBEANS. 
>> IS THAT WHY WE'VE SEEN AT 
LEAST A 1 POINT INCREASE IN THE 
GDP? 
WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE CAN LOOK 
AT THE NEXT QUARTER AND THINGS 
AFTER THAT. 
>> SO WE HAVE MAJOR GARRETT 
STANDING BY, HE IS THE WHITE 
HOUSE CHIEF CORRESPONDENT. 
>> Reporter: CLEARLY THE 
PRESIDENT IS NOT ONLY EXCITED 
ABOUT THIS ECONOMIC NEWS, BUT 
BELIEVES IT IS ECONOMIC 
VINDICATION FOR POLITICAL 
DECISIONS MOST OF THEM MADE IN 
THE FIRST YEAR OF HIS 
PRESIDENCY. 
ONE, TO TAKE A VERY AGGRESSIVE 
DEREGULATORY APPROACH TO WHAT 
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PUT IN 
ITS LAST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE. 
AND CAJOLE AND LOBBY AND WORK 
WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS TO 
PASS A LARGE CORPORATE TAX 
DECREASE, A LARGE PERSONAL 
INCOME TAX DECREASE, AND PUT 
REFORMS WITHIN THE SYSTEM. 
BOTH OF WHICH THE PRESIDENT 
SAYS IS RESPONSIBLE DIRECTLY 
FOR THIS VERY STRONG. 
IT CAN'T BE CHARACTERIZED AS 
ANY OTHER THING THAN THAT, VERY 
STRONG SECOND QUARTER GDP 
NUMBER. 
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID LOOK, A 
STRONG U.S. ECONOMY IS THE TIME 
TO ASSERT U.S. ECONOMIC 
DOMINANCE WHEN IT COMES TO 
TRADE. 
THIS WHITE HOUSE BELIEVES THAT 
A STRONG U.S. ECONOMY IS 
EXACTLY THE RIGHT AND MOST 
ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION TO CARRY 
THIS TRADE ARGUMENT TO EUROPE 
AND TO ASIA. 
AND THE PRESIDENT ALSO TOOK 
PAINS TO NOTE A SMALL DECREASE 
BUT A NOTICEABLE DECREASE, $50 
BILLION, IN THE TRADE DEFICIT. 
AND IT IS HIS BELIEF THAT THIS 
TRADE CONFRONTATION WILL 
ULTIMATELY BE RESOLVED AND THE 
TIME TO WAGE THAT CONFRONTATION 
IS WHEN THE U.S. ECONOMY IS 
GROWING. 
AND CAN BE RESILIENT AND CAN 
TAKE WHAT HE WOULD CHARACTERIZE 
AND MOST OF HIS ECONOMIC 
ADVISORS THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO 
CHARACTERIZE AS MOMENTARY 
CONFRONTATIONS OVER TRADE THAT 
ARE NOT GOING TO LAST FOR THE 
LONG-TERM. 
BUT ARE GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT 
DISRUPTIVE BUT IN THE END, 
ACCRUE MORE TO THE BENEFIT OF 
U.S. MANUFACTURERS, FARMERS, 
AND THE LIKE. 
AND THE TIME TO DO THAT THEY 
ARGUE IS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS 
ROBUST. 
WELL, CLEARLY THESE NUMBERS 
SUGGEST A ROBUST ECONOMY. 
WE WILL SEE IF THE PRESIDENT'S 
CALCULUS ABOUT TRADE PROVES TO 
BE CORRECT. 
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU HIS 
ECONOMIC TEAM BELIEVES NOW IS 
THE TIME TO WAGE THIS FIGHT AND 
THEY INTEND TO WAGE IT. 
>> YEAH, AND THAT'S A GREAT 
POINT TO MAKE MAJOR. 
WE CAN DISSECT THE NUMBERS AND 
WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE 
NUMBERS WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE 
NEXT QUARTER AND THE QUARTERS 
AFTER THAT. 
BUT YOUR POINT IS THAT THE U.S. 
ECONOMY IS DOING BETTER THAN IT 
DID IN YEARS PREVIOUS. 
AND THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE 
PRESIDENT, A TESTAMENT TO NOT 
ONLY THE POLICIES THAT HE'S PUT 
INTO PLACE, HE TALKED ABOUT 
DEREGULATION AND HE TALKED 
ABOUT THE -- THE TAX CUTS, BUT 
ALSO THE TEAM THAT HE HAS IN 
PLACE. 
HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT 
HE'S GOT SOME OF THE BEST AND 
BRIGHTEST THERE. 
>> Reporter: AND ONE THING TO 
KEEP IN MIND, AND I THINK THE 
MOST IMPORTANT OR ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT STATEMENTS MADE 
CAME RIGHT AT THE END, WHEN THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL 
ECONOMIC COUNCIL LARRY KUDLOW 
SAID THESE ARE NOT ONE-TIME 
NUMBERS. 
THESE NUMBERS AND THE GROWTH 
THAT THEY REPRESENT ARE 
SUSTAINABLE FOR AS FAR AS THE 
EYE CAN SEE. 
OR VERY DEEP INTO THE FUTURE. 
ALL RIGHT. 
THAT'S THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING 
THIS IS NOT A SUGAR HIGH. 
THIS IS NOT AN ECONOMIC SURGE 
THAT CAN'T BE SUSTAINED. 
THAT IS NOW GOING TO BE ONE OF 
THE MEASURING STICKS TO 
EVALUATE THIS ADMINISTRATION 
BETWEEN NOW AND 2020. 
BECAUSE I HAVE TALKED TO SOME 
ECONOMISTS WHO DO LOOK AT THESE 
NUMBERS AND SAY YES, THEY'RE 
VERY STRONG. 
THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS SAID 
THEY'RE SO STRONG THAT INTEREST 
RATES CAN BE RAISED TWICE MORE 
THIS CALENDAR YEAR. 
AND NOT DEAL A DESTABILIZING 
BLOW TO THE ECONOMY. 
THAT'S FINE. 
BUT THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE 
ECONOMIC DATA THAT ARE TO OTHER 
ECONOMISTS SOMEWHAT WORRISOME. 
THE FEDERAL DEFICIT KEEPED 
RISING IT'S GOING TO BE $1 
TRILLION THIS YEAR IN ALL 
LIKELIHOOD OR VERY CLOSE TO IT 
AND POSSIBLY $1 TRILLION FOR 
MANY, MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE. 
BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM. 
THAT MEANS HIGHER DEBT SERVICE, 
THAT MEANS LARGER NATIONAL 
DEBT. 
THAT MEANS GOVERNMENT BORROWING 
CROWDING OUT PRIVATE INVESTMENT 
BORROWING. 
THESE TWO THINGS COULD BECOME 
PROBLEMATIC IN THE NOT TOO 
DISTANT FUTURE. 
AND GOING BACK TO THE TRADE 
ISSUE, YES, THERE'S TREMENDOUS 
CONFIDENCE THAT THIS PRESIDENT 
IS DRIVING THAT ARGUMENT. 
WILL FORCE ROLL LIES AND -- 
ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES TO TRADE 
DIFFERENTLY WITH THE UNITED 
STATES BUT IF THIS BECOMES A 
TARIFF WAR AND U.S. MARKETS 
SHRINK AS A RESULT OF THAT, 
THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE 
EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND 
UNDERMINE THESE NUMBERS. 
SO WHEN LARRY SAYS ON BEHALF OF 
THE PRESIDENT WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE THIS GREAT ECONOMY, FOR A 
GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN THE 
FUTURE, THAT'S NOW A PROMISE. 
THE PROMISE IS MADE DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN HAVE LARGELY BEEN 
FULFILLED. 
NOW THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED A NEW 
BENCHMARK TO MEASURE THIS 
ECONOMY AND ITS FUTURE 
PERFORMANCE. 
>> MAJOR, JUST I MEAN IF WE ARE 
ABLE TO TAKE AWAY ALL OF THE -- 
YOU KNOW, THE THINGS THAT HAVE 
HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF 
THIS WEEK THAT REALLY MATTER TO 
AMERICANS, AND IF YOU TAKE AWAY 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
INVESTIGATION, YOU TAKE AWAY 
MICHAEL COHEN, YOU TAKE AWAY 
ALL THE NOISE AROUND HELSINKI, 
THE PRESIDENT HAS ACTUALLY HAD 
A VERY GOOD WEEK. 
HE LITERALLY KISSED AND MADE UP 
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
HE'S ABLE TO SAY LOOK THE DEAL 
THAT I HAMMERED WITH THE NORTH 
KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN HAS 
RESULTED IN SOMETHING TANGIBLE. 
TODAY HE CAN TALK ABOUT THE 
STRONG GDP NUMBERS. 
SO IF YOUD IF HA TOISES -- HAD 
TO ASSESS THE PRESIDENT'S WEEK 
AND TAKE AWAY THAT STUFF WHICH 
I KNOW YOU REALLY CAN'T. 
BUT LOOKING AT TANGIBLE 
BENEFITS THAT MOST AMERICANS 
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAY 
WELL ACTUALLY I CAN SEE THE 
RESULTS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
POLICIES AND HIS ACTIONS, IT'S 
A GOOD WEEK FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
>> Reporter: WELL, LET'S START 
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS WOULD SAY 
YES. 
THE PRESIDENT CALLED THE 
QUESTION. 
HE MADE NOISE. 
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION 
RESPONDED. 
NOW WE DON'T KNOW THE ULTIMATE 
RESULT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. 
BUT THINGS HAVE STEPPED BACK 
FROM AN ALL-OUT TRADE WAR. 
AND IF THEY'RE RESOLVED TO THE 
SATISFACTION OF BOTH PARTIES, 
THEN THE PRESIDENT BY DRIVING 
THAT HARD BARGAIN WILL HAVE 
SUCCEEDED AND THAT WILL BE A 
WIN. 
NO ONE IN AMERICA WILL IN ANY 
WAY CONTEST IT'S NOT IMPORTANT 
AND NOT HISTORICALLY MEANINGFUL 
TO HAVE REMAINS FROM THE KOREAN 
WAR RETURNED TO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
OF COURSE IT'S MEANINGFUL. 
THAT'S A BEGINNING STEP. 
IT DOESN'T ADDRESS PROMISES 
FROM THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME ON 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
BUT IT IS A CONFIDENCE BUILDING 
MANEUVER. 
NOT AN UNIMPORTANT ONE. 
IT HAD SOME HICCUPS AND MISSED 
MEETINGS AND SOME 
MISCOMMUNICATIONS BUT IT 
APPEARS TO BE MOVING IN A 
DIRECTION OF PROGRESS. 
MUCH MORE WORK HAS TO BE DONE. 
THAT'S NOT MY ASSESSMENT. 
THAT'S THE ASSESSMENT OF THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
WHO TOLD THE SENATE FOREIGN 
RELATIONS COMMITTEE JUST THAT 
EARLIER THIS WEEK. 
THERE'S A LODGE WAY TO GO. 
-- LONG WAY TO GO. 
ON THE ECONOMY, THE PRESIDENT 
WILL SAY AND HAS SAID THAT THIS 
IS WHAT I PROMISED IN THE 
CAMPAIGN. 
THIS IS WHAT I DELIVERED WITH 
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS. 
LAST YEAR. 
HERE ARE THE RESULTS, JUDGE FOR 
YOURSELF. 
AND HE IS PERFECTLY WILLING TO 
BE JUDGED ON THESE RESULTS. 
>> ALL RIGHT MAJOR GARRETT FOR 
US AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THANK 
YOU SO MUCH MAJOR. 
>> YOU GOT IT. 
>>> TODAY IN MONEY WATCH. 
McDONALD'S IS NOT LOVING THIS 
ONE. 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
FALLEN ILL AFTER EATING AT THE 
FAST FOOD CHAIN HAS JUMPED 
RATHER DRAMATICALLY. 
ACCORDING TO THE CDC, 286 
PEOPLE IN 15 STATES HAVE GOTTEN 
SICK FROM SALADS. 
NOT TO GROSS YOU OUT BUT THEY 
WERE CONTAMINATED WITH PAR DIET 
THAT'S TRANSMITTED IN FOOD THAT 
HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH FECAL 
MATTER. 
McDONALD'S SAYS IT'S TAKING 
CARE OF THE ISSUE. 
SORRY. 
HOPE YOU ARE NOT EATING. 
>> NO. 
>>> PAPA JOHN'S IS NOW SUING 
PAPA JOHN'
