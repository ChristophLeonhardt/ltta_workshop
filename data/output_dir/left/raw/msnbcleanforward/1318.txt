00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,329
ARE, THEY ARE LIKELY ALREADY COOPERATING WITH THE

168
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:27,763
COOPERATING WITH THE PROSECUTORS.

169
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:28,231
PROSECUTORS. >> YEAH.

170
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:30,166
>> YEAH. WHOEVER THEY ARE, YOU KNOW BOB

171
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,001
WHOEVER THEY ARE, YOU KNOW BOB MUELLER KNOWS WHO THEY ARE AND

172
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,070
MUELLER KNOWS WHO THEY ARE AND YOU KNOW THEY KNOW BOB MUELLER

173
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,837
YOU KNOW THEY KNOW BOB MUELLER KNOWS WHO THEY ARE.

174
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,639
KNOWS WHO THEY ARE. BUT IF I COULD MAKE A QUICK

175
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,375
BUT IF I COULD MAKE A QUICK POINT ABOUT DAVID PECKER, AN

176
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:40,276
POINT ABOUT DAVID PECKER, AN INTERESTING PART ABOUT THE

177
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:41,210
INTERESTING PART ABOUT THE INFORMATION, THE STATEMENT OF

178
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:43,880
INFORMATION, THE STATEMENT OF FACTS THAT HE PLEADED TO IS THAT

179
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:46,349
FACTS THAT HE PLEADED TO IS THAT IN 2015, A YEAR BEFORE THIS ALL

180
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:49,385
IN 2015, A YEAR BEFORE THIS ALL GOES DOWN, THERE IS AN AGREEMENT

181
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:53,389
GOES DOWN, THERE IS AN AGREEMENT WITH PECKER AND AMI TO HANDLE

182
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,925
WITH PECKER AND AMI TO HANDLE THE PROBLEMS AND THE HUSH

183
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:02,699
THE PROBLEMS AND THE HUSH AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD BE

184
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:03,967
AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY.

185
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:04,501
NECESSARY. ARJ

186
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:06,269
ARJ ARGUABLY, THAT WOULD BE THE

187
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,873
ARGUABLY, THAT WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THE CRIMINAL

188
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:15,712
BEGINNING OF THE CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY HERE.

189
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,914
CONSPIRACY HERE. SO THAT PUTS PECKER REALLY IN

190
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:18,581
SO THAT PUTS PECKER REALLY IN THE HOT SEAT.

191
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:20,116
THE HOT SEAT. >> THAT’S SUCH AN IMPORTANT

192
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,217
>> THAT’S SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT HARRY MADE.

193
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:23,052
POINT THAT HARRY MADE. I NOTICED THAT WHEN I WAS

194
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:24,421
I NOTICED THAT WHEN I WAS READING IT I DIDN’T HIGHLIGHT IT

195
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,156
READING IT I DIDN’T HIGHLIGHT IT THE WAY HARRY JUST DID.

196
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,325
THE WAY HARRY JUST DID. I’M SO GLAD HE DID BECAUSE THIS

197
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:29,893
I’M SO GLAD HE DID BECAUSE THIS INTRODUCES AN ELEMENT OF

198
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,962
INTRODUCES AN ELEMENT OF PRE-MEDATION AND RATHER DISTANT

199
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:34,898
PRE-MEDATION AND RATHER DISTANT PRE-MEDATION FROM THE EVENTS

200
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:38,401
PRE-MEDATION FROM THE EVENTS THAT BACTUALLY ERUPT THE NEXT

201
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:39,903
THAT BACTUALLY ERUPT THE NEXT YEAR WITH THE TWO WOMEN THAT

202
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,739
YEAR WITH THE TWO WOMEN THAT CREATED THE DYNAMICS THAT FORCED

203
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:44,908
CREATED THE DYNAMICS THAT FORCED OR ENCOURAGED, I SHOULD SAY,

204
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:45,976
OR ENCOURAGED, I SHOULD SAY, DONALD TRUMP AND MICHAEL COHEN

205
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:47,744
DONALD TRUMP AND MICHAEL COHEN AND OTHERS IN THE CAMPAIGN TO

206
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:48,912
AND OTHERS IN THE CAMPAIGN TO COMMIT THIS CRIME.

207
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,514
COMMIT THIS CRIME. AND SO IT WASN’T SOMETHING THAT

208
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:54,317
AND SO IT WASN’T SOMETHING THAT WAS SUDDENLY UPON HIM AND THESE

209
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:55,919
WAS SUDDENLY UPON HIM AND THESE INEXPERIENCED PEOPLE JUST KIND

210
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,155
INEXPERIENCED PEOPLE JUST KIND OF FRANTICALLY TRIED TO PUT

211
00:06:58,155 --> 00:06:59,156
OF FRANTICALLY TRIED TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER TO PROTECT

212
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:00,057
SOMETHING TOGETHER TO PROTECT THE CANDIDATE.

213
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:01,392
THE CANDIDATE. THIS WAS SOMETHING PLANNED.

214
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:11,168
THIS WAS SOMETHING PLANNED. THIS WAS A PREMEDITATED, PLANNED

215
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:11,602
THIS WAS A PREMEDITATED, PLANNED MILLION PLAN.

216
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:11,935
MILLION PLAN. >> YEAH.

217
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,437
>> YEAH. IT HAS ALL THE EAR MARKS OF A

218
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:13,870
IT HAS ALL THE EAR MARKS OF A CONSPIRACY.

219
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:15,139
CONSPIRACY. AND THEN THEY PULL THE TRIGGER

220
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:17,040
AND THEN THEY PULL THE TRIGGER AS THE ELECTION APPROACHES, VERY

221
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,475
AS THE ELECTION APPROACHES, VERY CLOSE TO THE ELECTION.

222
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:20,277
CLOSE TO THE ELECTION. ANYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE

223
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:23,180
ANYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE AGREEMENT TO VIOLATE THE

224
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:25,149
AGREEMENT TO VIOLATE THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS X, EVEN IF

225
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:26,650
CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS X, EVEN IF THEY DID NOTHING MORE THAN

226
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,286
THEY DID NOTHING MORE THAN AGREE, COULD BE ON THE HOOK

227
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:29,953
AGREE, COULD BE ON THE HOOK HERE.

228
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:32,389
HERE. WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE MANY

229
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:34,825
WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE MANY OVERT ACTS IN THESE PAYMENTS, IN

230
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,159
OVERT ACTS IN THESE PAYMENTS, IN THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT

231
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,261
THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT WENT ALONG WITH THEM.

232
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,096
WENT ALONG WITH THEM. ANYBODY THAT WAS PART OF THAT

233
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,864
ANYBODY THAT WAS PART OF THAT AGREEMENT COULD BE GUILTY OF

234
00:07:40,898 --> 00:07:41,298
AGREEMENT COULD BE GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY.

235
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:42,666
CONSPIRACY. THAT LIKELY INCLUDES ALL OF

236
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,301
THAT LIKELY INCLUDES ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IDENTIFIED BY CODE

237
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,903
THESE PEOPLE IDENTIFIED BY CODE NAME ONLY IN THE CURRENT

238
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:48,572
NAME ONLY IN THE CURRENT CHARGING DOCUMENTS, BUT WHOSE

CHARGING DOCUMENTS, BUT WHOSE IDENTITIES WILL BECOME KNOWN

00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,875
IDENTITIES WILL BECOME KNOWN OVER THE COMING MONTHS.

241
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,310
OVER THE COMING MONTHS. IT MAY BE THAT SOME ARE ALREADY

242
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:54,878
IT MAY BE THAT SOME ARE ALREADY COOPERATING AND IT MAY BE THAT

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,915
COOPERATING AND IT MAY BE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ONE OF THOSE

244
00:07:57,915 --> 00:07:58,382
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ONE OF THOSE COCONSPIRATORS.

245
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:00,918
COCONSPIRATORS. >> AND DAVID THE PRESIDENT NOW

246
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,987
>> AND DAVID THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYING THAT I TALKED ABOUT THIS.

SAYING THAT I TALKED ABOUT THIS. I TALKED ABOUT THE PAYMENTS AND

248
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,192
I TALKED ABOUT THE PAYMENTS AND IN HIS ANSWER TO FOX NEWS TODAY,

249
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:09,427
IN HIS ANSWER TO FOX NEWS TODAY, HE SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACT

250
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:10,828
HE SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT I TWEETED ABOUT THE

251
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:11,195
THAT I TWEETED ABOUT THE PAYMENTS.

252
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:12,930
PAYMENTS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

253
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,932
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED ONLY AFTER RUDY GIULIANI HAD

254
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:17,201
ONLY AFTER RUDY GIULIANI HAD THAT MOMENT ON TV WHERE HE

255
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:19,537
THAT MOMENT ON TV WHERE HE BLURTED OUT DONALD TRUMP’S

256
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,072
BLURTED OUT DONALD TRUMP’S INVOLVEMENT IN THE PAYMENTS NOT

257
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,607
INVOLVEMENT IN THE PAYMENTS NOT LONG AFTER DONALD TRUMP HAD

258
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:23,641
LONG AFTER DONALD TRUMP HAD DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE

259
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:24,008
DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAYMENTS.

260
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,877
PAYMENTS. >> WELL, DONALD HAS TOLD SO MANY

261
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:29,146
>> WELL, DONALD HAS TOLD SO MANY LIES HERE ABOUT SO MANY THINGS

262
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:30,348
LIES HERE ABOUT SO MANY THINGS THAT I DON’T THINK HE COULD KEEP

263
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:31,249
THAT I DON’T THINK HE COULD KEEP THEM STRAIGHT.

264
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,484
THEM STRAIGHT. I CAN’T KEEP THEM STRAIGHT

265
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:34,018
I CAN’T KEEP THEM STRAIGHT WITHOUT A WRITTEN LIST.

266
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:36,420
WITHOUT A WRITTEN LIST. AND SO -- AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS

267
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,287
AND SO -- AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS GOING BEYOND THIS.

268
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:38,756
GOING BEYOND THIS. I THINK IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT

269
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,558
I THINK IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT MICHAEL COHEN WAS SERVED

270
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,260
THAT MICHAEL COHEN WAS SERVED WITH A SUBPOENA ABOUT THE TRUMP

271
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,695
WITH A SUBPOENA ABOUT THE TRUMP FOUNDATION MATTERS WHICH ALSO

272
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:45,964
FOUNDATION MATTERS WHICH ALSO COULD INVOLVE CRIMINALITY BY

273
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:47,966
COULD INVOLVE CRIMINALITY BY DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY AND

274
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,001
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY AND HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO THAT

275
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:51,970
HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO THAT SUBPOENA TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT

276
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:57,041
SUBPOENA TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND SAID, GROW,EE, I

IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE MORE EAGER TO GET OUT THERE AND
