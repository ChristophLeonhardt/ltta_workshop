1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:01,870
DANA PERINO AND GREG GUTFELD.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,671
IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY, AND

3
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:11,480
THIS IS.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,481
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STANDING FIRM

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:14,283
ON HIS DECISION TO PULL THE PLUG

6
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:17,152
ON A WHITE HOUSE INVITATION FOR

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,620
THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPION

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,154
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES.

9
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:21,623
THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD POSTING A

10
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:23,892
CELEBRATION OF AMERICA EVENT.

11
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:26,662
>> WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY.

12
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:28,864
WE RESPECT OUR FLAG AND WE

13
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:30,632
PARLAY STAND FOR THE

14
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:31,099
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

15
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,734
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE

16
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:33,869
UNDERSTOOD.

17
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,504
WE STAND TO HONOR OUR MILITARY

18
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:39,608
AND TO HONOR OUR COUNTRY AND TO

19
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:40,409
REMEMBER THE FALLEN HEROES WHO

20
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,413
NEVER MADE IT BACK HOME.

21
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:46,348
>> Kimberly: AFTER THE TEAM

22
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:47,983
WAS DISINVITED, THE PHILADELPHIA

23
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:50,085
MAYOR SLAMMED THE PRESIDENT IS

24
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:50,719
"NOT A TRUE PATRIOT" AND

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,389
LAUNCHED A NEW PERSONAL ATTACK.

26
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,459
>> THE GUY IS A SCARY GUY.

27
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:00,062
I DON'T -- HOPEFULLY BY THE TIME

28
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:00,896
HE IS GONE, WE CAN RECOVER FROM

29
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:02,898
THIS MESS.

30
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:05,234
BUT THIS IS A BAD TIME IN OUR

31
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:06,502
I'M FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE FACT

32
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:08,303
THAT HE HAS HIS HANDS IN THE

33
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:09,738
NUCLEAR CODES, THAT HE THREATENS

34
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:14,243
TO ANNIHILATE NORTH KOREA.

35
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:18,180
>> Kimberly: MEANWHILE.

36
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,982
SHAKING MY HEAD.

37
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:20,916
MEANWHILE, THE WHITE HOUSE IS

38
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,051
ACCUSING THE EAGLES OF PLAYING

39
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:23,552
POLITICS.

40
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:26,788
>> THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT

41
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:28,190
BY THE EAGLES FRANCHISE, THEN

42
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,892
THEY WOULD NOT PLAN TO ATTEND

43
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:31,093
THE EVENT AND HAVE BACKED OUT OF

44
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:31,693
THE LAST MINUTE.

45
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:34,596
IF IT WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT,

46
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:35,697
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ATTEMPTED TO

47
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:36,999
RESCHEDULE THE VISIT WHEN THEY

48
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:38,500
KNEW THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS

49
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,701
GOING TO BE OVERSEAS.

50
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:40,736
IF THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL

51
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:41,870
STUNT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED

52
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,206
UNTIL MONDAY.

53
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:44,806
>> Kimberly: JESSE IS A

54
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:45,874
DIE-HARD EAGLES FAN AND HE WAS

55
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:49,478
THERE FOR ALL THE ACTION AT THE

56
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:50,279
WHITE HOUSE.

57
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,280
HEY, JESSE.

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,415
>> HEY, KAMIL E.

59
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:54,016
>> Kimberly: HOW ARE YOU

60
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,518
FEELING ABOUT THIS?

61
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:59,221
I KNOW YOU ARE A HUGE EAGLES

62
00:01:59,221 --> 00:01:59,488
FAN.

63
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:00,088
>> HUGE FAN.

64
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:03,659
LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.

65
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,893
BOTH ARE WINNERS.

66
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:07,296
THE EAGLES BEAT THE PATRIOTS AND

67
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,062
TRUMP BEAT CRICKET HILLARY.

68
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:08,497
WE HAVE THAT.

69
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:11,266
NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY

70
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,067
FROM US.

71
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:13,302
IT'S TOUGH FOR ME.

72
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:14,903
EAGLES, TRUMP.

73
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:15,470
I AM A PHILLY GUY.

74
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,706
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SIDE WITH

75
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:18,006
TRUMP.

76
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:20,409
THE EAGLES TRIED A TRICK PLAY,

77
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,010
TRUMP SNIFFED IT OUT AND SHOW

78
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,477
DOWN.

79
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:25,047
I DON'T LIKE THE GAMESMANSHIP

80
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:28,517
WITH THE GUEST LIST.

81
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:30,285
IT WAS LESS THAN TEN PEOPLE.

82
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,920
IT WAS LIKE OWNER, ASSISTANT

83
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,888
COACH AND MASCARA.

84
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:34,089
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE MAYOR

85
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:35,090
COMING IN.

86
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,359
HE DOESN'T SPEAK FOR THE

87
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:37,893
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES.

88
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:40,796
HE SOUNDS LIKE JOY BEHAR.

89
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:42,864
THE GUY IS A JOKE.

90
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,900
WHAT MESSAGE THIS COUNTRY IN?

91
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,768
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS GUY IS

92
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:47,569
TALKING TO.

93
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,271
EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY TO BE THERE.

94
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:50,472
THEY DIDN'T SEE THE EAGLES.

95
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:51,239
THEY SAW ME.

96
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,342
I WAS KIND OF THE CONSOLATION

97
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:55,510
PRIZE.

98
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,478
ALTHOUGH ONE PERSON THOUGHT I

99
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:57,045
WAS TED MOSBY.

100
00:02:57,045 --> 00:03:01,049
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO THAT IS.

101
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,285
ANOTHER PERCENTILE I WAS

102
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:03,752
TUCKER CARLSON.

103
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:04,486
>> Kimberly: WOW.

104
00:03:04,486 --> 00:03:06,321
YOU ARE REALLY WINNING OVER

105
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:07,089
THERE.

106
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:09,458
BIG DAY, HUGE DAY FOR JESSE.

107
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:09,858
THAT'S FINE.

108
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:13,996
BRIAN, YOU WANT TO CHIME IN?

109
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:17,899
>> Brian: JESSE, IF WE ARE

110
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,201
UNDERSTAND THIS ABOUT THE EAGLES

111
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,068
DIDN'T SHOW.

112
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,470
THEY MADE IT CLEAR LATE LAST

113
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,473
WEEK THEY WERE GOING TO SHOP.

114
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:26,074
THEY TRIED TO TRUMP TRUMP.

115
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:26,775
WHEN TRUMP PULLED THE RUG OUT

116
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,610
FROM THEM FROM WITHIN THE

117
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,077
ATTACKS CAME.

118
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,412
WHO IS THE WINNER?

119
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:32,481
I DON'T GET IT.

120
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:34,082
>> Jesse: LIKE I SAID, THEY

121
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:34,850
ARE BOTH WINNERS.

122
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,685
THE EAGLES HAVE THE TROPHY.

123
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:38,120
THAT'S NEVER GOING TO CHANGE.

124
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,489
TRUMP DOES WHAT HE DOES.

125
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:41,990
HE DID THE SINGAPORE DANCE WITH

126
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,125
LITTLE ROCKET MAN CANCELING THE

127
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:43,792
MEETING AND THEN BRINGING IT

128
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:46,261
BACK ON.

129
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,896
THE EAGLES DON'T LOOK AT HERE

130
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:49,531
BUT PHILADELPHIA FANS, I DON'T

131
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:51,366
REALLY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

132
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:51,833
CARE VERY MUCH.

133
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,536
WE ARE STILL GOING TO CHEER FOR

134
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:55,470
THE EAGLES.

135
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,872
THE TRUMP PEOPLE IN PENNSYLVANIA

136
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,507
ARE STILL GOING TO PULL THE

137
00:03:58,507 --> 00:03:59,675
LEVER FOR DONALD.

138
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:01,710
>> Kimberly: HERE WE GO.

139
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,112
SUPPORTED HER NEEDS NEWS AT

140
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:04,579
NIGHT.

141
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,482
>> Juan: I AM DEEPLY OFFENDED.

142
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:11,319
NOBODY SAID HEY, AREN'T YOU

143
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:11,753
JUAN WILLIAMS?

144
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:12,688
[LAUGHTER]

145
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:13,321
>> Jesse: NO, JUAN.

146
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:15,090
I DID NOT HAPPEN.

147
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,125
>> Juan: YOU NOY PULLING YOUR

148
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:17,392
LEG.

149
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:21,296
LAST WEEK, THE NFL OWNERS SAID

150
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:23,331
THEY WERE SETTING NEW RULES FOR

151
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:26,902
THIS COMING SEASON TO REQUIRE

152
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:28,070
THE PLAYER SITTING FOR THE

153
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,737
ANTHEM WILL REMAIN IN THE

154
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:29,671
LOCKER ROOM.

155
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,406
THIS MORNING HE IS TWEETING OUT

156
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:35,477
NO ESCAPE TO THE LOCKER ROOM.

157
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:37,312
THE OWNERS AREN'T EVEN ESCAPING.

158
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:38,880
TRUMP IS BULLYING THE PLAYERS

159
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,084
AND THE OWNERS, AM I WRONG?

160
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:43,118
>> Jesse: I THINK BULLYING IS

161
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,319
A TOUGH TERM, JUAN.

162
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,288
I THINK WE ALL NEED TO GROW UP

163
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,724
AND STOP BEING SO SENSITIVE

164
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,959
ABOUT BULLYING HERE.

165
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,660
THESE ARE BILLIONAIRE OWNERS

166
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,461
MAKING A FORTUNE.

167
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:55,297
I THINK EVERYBODY IS A GROWN UP

168
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:58,200
HERE.

169
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,168
HE DIDN'T LIKE THIS KIND OF IN

170
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,336
BETWEEN DEAL WHERE YOU GET TO

171
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,904
STAY IN THE LOCKER ROOM FOR THE

172
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:04,306
ANTHEM OR YOU'RE GOING TO COME

173
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,107
OUT AND STAND.

174
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:07,075
HE WANTS IT ALL IN.

175
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:09,344
YOU'RE EITHER 100% FOR THE

176
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:10,112
COUNTRY AND THE FLAG, OR WE ARE

177
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:11,947
NOT GOING TO PLAY BALL.

178
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:14,416
HE'S GOING TO FIGHT UNTIL HE IS

179
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,484
SATISFIED THAT AND WE WILL SEE

180
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,518
WHO BACKS DOWN.

181
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:18,420
SEEMED LIKE THE OWNERS BACKED

182
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,322
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

183
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:21,890
>> Kimberly: JESSE, ANY MORE

184
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,191
HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE DAY?

185
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:24,760
>> Jesse: I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS

186
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,495
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS TRYING TO

187
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:27,395
TALK TO THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE

188
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,498
WAS LEAVING, I DIDN'T GET A

189
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:30,298
CHANCE TO.

190
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,734
I LOST MY DAD FOR A SECOND, WHO

191
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:33,135
I BROUGHT.

192
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:34,302
I CAUGHT BACK UP WITH HIM AND I

193
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,605
SAID DAD, WHERE WERE YOU?

194
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:38,874
HE GOES, I JUST DID AN INTERVIEW

195
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:39,741
WITH ABC.

196
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:42,043
AND I'M LIKE, WAS A LOCAL ABC?

197
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:44,713
HE GOES I DON'T KNOW.

198
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,114
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NATIONAL.

199
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:48,884
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY DAD SAID

200
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:50,285
ON CAMERA TO ABC.

201
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:52,754
I THINK HE IS JEALOUS THAT MOM

202
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:54,489
TEXTS HAVE TAKEN OFF.

203
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,091
>> Kimberly: I THINK YOUR DAD

204
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,326
SHOULD GET AN AGENT NEXT, RIGHT?

205
00:05:58,326 --> 00:05:59,694
I DON'T KNOW.

206
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,097
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS FOUND EACH

207
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:02,397
OTHER.

208
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:03,098
BUDDY SYSTEM AND ALL.

209
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:04,132
SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS FUN.

210
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:06,034
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAY

211
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,335
GOODBYE NOW, PARTING IS SUCH

212
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:10,872
SWEET SORROW, JESSE.

213
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,307
GET BACK TO WINNING.

214
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:15,277
>> Brian: HOW COME PEOPLE SAY

215
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:15,944
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD HAVE

216
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:17,479
HAPPENED ANYWAY.

217
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,514
HE HAS THE MASCOT, THE OWNER,

218
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:20,682
WHO HATES HIM, DESPISES HIM,

219
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:21,616
SINCE HE'S DESTROYING THE

220
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:22,684
COUNTRY.

221
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:24,085
ONE OTHER PLAYER PERHAPS.

222
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,687
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE'S GOING TO

223
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:26,321
HAVE IT?

224
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:28,256
HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE IT?

225
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,125
HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CANCEL

226
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:30,392
IT.

227
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:31,793
>> Juan: THAT'S NOT TRUE.

228
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:35,697
HE HAD ISSUED AN INVITATION.

229
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:37,399
THE POINT IS THAT THE PLAYERS

230
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,369
DIDN'T WANT TO BE USED AS, LIKE,

231
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:42,904
THEY WANTED TO HAVE A REAL -- I

232
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:46,942
THINK THEY REQUESTED TIME WITH

233
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:47,242
TRUMP.

234
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:48,476
THEY WERE TOLD NO.

235
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,878
>> Brian: THEY WERE NOT TOLD

236
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:50,145
NO.

237
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:52,981
THE REQUEST WAS WITH 85 REQUESTS

238
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:56,284
FOR INVITATIONS AND PRESS

239
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:56,685
CREDENTIALS.

240
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:57,953
YOU KNOW THE PHOTO OP DESIGN

241
00:06:57,953 --> 00:06:59,588
THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

242
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:00,889
>> Juan: THEY DON'T WANT A

243
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:01,489
PHOTO UP.

244
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,225
THIS IS SOMETHING ONE OF THE

245
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:04,292
FORMER PLAYERS SAID.

246
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,894
IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE

247
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:06,261
STANDING.

248
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,730
A LOT OF THESE GUYS DON'T LIKE

249
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,164
DONALD TRUMP.

250
00:07:09,164 --> 00:07:10,232
>> Kimberly: DANA, LET'S TALK

251
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:13,902
ABOUT HOW THIS PLAYED OUT.

252
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:16,204
PEOPLE EXPECTING THIS FUN, HAPPY

253
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:17,672
THING.

254
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:20,141
AND YOU HAVE THE MAYOR WHO

255
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,510
SOUNDED KIND OF CRAZY.

256
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,312
>> Dana: CAN I SAY I THINK THE

257
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:26,514
WHOLE THING, ALL OF IT IS A REAL

258
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:26,915
SHAME.

259
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:29,150
I DON'T LIKE CULTURE WAR STUFF.

260
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,886
I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

261
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:33,288
SUCH GOOD NEWS TO TALK ABOUT.

262
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:34,522
THEY LEAD THE WHITE HOUSE

263
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:36,358
BRIEFING TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE

264
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:38,360
ECONOMY WHICH IS ROARING.

265
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,329
THEN THEY HAVE ALL THE STUFF.

266
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,931
CULTURAL STUFF WILL ALWAYS RISE

267
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:43,698
TO THE TOP.

268
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:45,500
IT WILL GET COVER THE MOST.

269
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,835
I DO THINK IT'S A SHAME.

270
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:48,770
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE THE

271
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,372
DETAILS BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF

272
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:52,207
THE FACTS, AS I UNDERSTAND THEM,

273
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:52,707
ARE IN DISPUTE.

274
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:54,910
IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A PERSONAL

275
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,810
MEETING BEHIND-THE-SCENES?

276
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,513
WE DON'T KNOW.

277
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:00,115
I DON'T KNOW.

278
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:00,815
YOU SAID THEY DIDN'T.

279
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,518
>> Brian: THEY REQUESTED IT.

280
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:05,287
I DON'T KNOW THEY WERE DENIED.

281
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:06,388
>> Dana: I DON'T KNOW.

282
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:07,889
I THINK IT'S A SHAME.

283
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,157
IT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE ONE OF THE

284
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,660
BEST THINGS TO DO IS JUST TO

285
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,661
STOP HAVING TEENS COME TO THE

286
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:15,997
WHITE HOUSE AND FOCUS ON THE

287
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:16,665
PEOPLES BUSINESS.

288
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,633
>> Kimberly: GREG, WHERE DO

289
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,701
YOU FALL?

290
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,770
>> Greg: I DON'T GIVE A TOSS

291
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,370
ABOUT THESE PLAYERS.

292
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,105
I AM ALL HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT

293
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,006
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

294
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:25,707
IT.

295
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:26,474
THE ECONOMY IS GOOD.

296
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:29,911
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

297
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,313
WHERE IS ISIS RIGHT NOW?

298
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:33,148
NORTH KOREA IS AT THE TABLE.

299
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:35,951
WE HAVE IRAN ON WATCH.

300
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:39,287
WE HAVE SO MUCH GOOD NEWS.

301
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,489
I REALLY DON'T CARE THAT THESE

302
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:42,190
PLAYERS ARE UPSET OR OFFENDED.

303
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,093
I DON'T CARE.

304
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:45,794
THEY ARE MILLIONAIRES.

305
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:48,697
THE OWNERS ARE BILLIONAIRES.

306
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:51,499
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO, SEE

307
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,401
TRUMP DO IS MAYBE DO A DRILLING

308
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,836
INITIATIVE TO DEAL WITH THE GAS

309
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:55,170
PRICES.

310
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,905
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

311
00:08:56,905 --> 00:08:58,573
THE MEDIA HAS CARRIED THE WATER

312
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:00,475
ON THIS AND MADE IT A TERRIBLE

313
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:01,309
STORY.

314
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,345
THE CLAIMANT IS NOT DIRECTED AT

315
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:04,813
THE ANTHEM COLLEGES GOING

316
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:05,513
AGAINST OUR EYES.

317
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:06,581
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A FOOTBALL

318
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:07,349
GAME.

319
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,317
YOU CAN SAY IT'S ABOUT POLICE

320
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:09,884
BRUTALITY BEAVER WE'RE WATCHING

321
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:12,754
IT HAPPEN DURING THE ANTHEM.

322
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:15,490
THE ANTHEM IS A POLITICAL ACT.

323
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,858
STANDING FOR THE ANTHEM IS A

324
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:17,292
POLITICAL ACT.

325
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:20,395
SO IS THE FOURTH OF JULY, SO WAS

326
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:20,929
THE FLAG.

327
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:21,496
THAT IS GARBAGE.

328
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:24,299
IT'S JUST A SYMBOL.

329
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,901
SAYING IT IS A FREE-SPEECH ISSUE

330
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:27,635
COMMITS ONLY FREE-SPEECH IF IT

331
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,704
IS PERTAINING TO THE GOVERNMENT.

332
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:31,306
THIS IS AN ACTUAL BUSINESS.

333
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:32,874
YOU ARE NOT GETTING ARRESTED FOR

334
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:33,375
SAYING SOMETHING.

335
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,378
YOU ARE JUST BEING, YOU'RE BEING

336
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:37,712
PENALIZED AS AN EMPLOYEE.

337
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:40,081
THE WAY THE MEDIA HAS CURATED,

338
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:40,815
AND HE SIGHED SPECIFICALLY IN

339
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:43,818
THE PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH

340
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:46,254
APRIL RYAN AND THE OTHER DUDE

341
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:50,492
FROM NBC OR PEPPERING SANDERS

342
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:51,993
WITH REDUNDANT, STUPID QUESTIONS

343
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,129
LIKE AREN'T YOU AWARE THIS IS

344
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,296
ABOUT BRUTALITY?

345
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,498
AREN'T YOU AWARE THE MESSAGES

346
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:57,332
CONVOLUTED?

347
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:58,767
WHEN YOU SEE PLAYERS UP THERE,

348
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:03,638
THEY ARE MAKING -- THERE'S

349
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,707
KNEELING DURING THE

350
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:06,474
NATIONAL ANTHEM, THEY ARE MAKING

351
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:07,909
A HUGE MISTAKE.

352
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,210
THEY ARE INJECTING POLITICS INTO

353
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,378
A NONPOLITICAL EVENT.

354
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:11,846
WE TALK ABOUT THIS EVERY YEAR.

355
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,548
WE TALK ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO

356
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,750
RUIN A THANKSGIVING DINNER IS TO

357
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,718
TALK ABOUT POLITICS.

358
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:19,120
SOMEHOW IT'S DIFFERENT AT A

359
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,722
SPORTING EVENT?

360
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:21,322
NO.

361
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,991
YOU INJECT POLITICS AT AN

362
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:23,758
APPROPRIATE VENUE.

363
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,527
YOU PAY THE PRICE.

364
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,328
WE ARE SO OVER THIS.

365
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:27,662
MOVE ON.

366
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:30,565
>> Juan: LET ME TELL YOU HOW

367
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:31,733
IMPORTANT THIS IS.

368
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,935
IT'S ABOUT CULTURE WARS, AS DANA

369
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:34,335
SAID.

370
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,737
IT'S PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS

371
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:37,072
BECAUSE IT TEARS OF THE FABRIC

372
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:40,809
OF OUR SOCIETY WITH REGARD TO

373
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:41,176
RACE.

374
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:42,677
>> Greg: I AGREE.

375
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:43,745
BUT YOU SEE EVERYTHING THROUGH

376
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:44,379
THE PRISM OF RACE.

377
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,847
>> Juan: I DO NOT.

378
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,215
I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT

379
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,551
MAJORITY OF THE COLOR OF THE

380
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:50,718
PLAYERS, THE ONES KNEELING AND

381
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,954
RAISING A FIST BECAUSE OF

382
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:57,559
PROTESTING BRUTALITY.

383
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,895
LET ME EXPLAIN.

384
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,730
IN FACT, THE RULING OUT OF THE

385
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,499
FLAG AND THE ANTHEM WITH THE

386
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,200
PLAYERS ON THE SIDELINES IS A

387
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,303
NEW REALITY.

388
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:09,671
IT USED TO BE THAT THEY WERE

389
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:10,438
ALWAYS IN THE LOCKER ROOM DURING

390
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:10,972
THE PLAYING OF THE

391
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:11,940
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

392
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,141
NOW THEY ARE ON THE SIDELINES.

393
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,177
IN RECENT YEARS, THERE'S BEEN AN

394
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:20,915
EXPLOSION, BIG FLAGS, FLYOVERS.

395
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:23,218
IN SO MANY CASES, IN FACT WHAT

396
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:23,885
YOU SEE IS THAT THE NFL WAS

397
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,721
CHARGING THE MILITARY.

398
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:29,491
>> Greg: WE ARE VEERING OFF TO

399
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:29,891
ANOTHER --

400
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:33,995
I WANT TO AGREE WITH YOU, JUAN.

401
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:35,463
>> Juan: POLITICS AND SPORTS

402
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:38,099
IS IMPORTANT IN AMERICA TODAY.

403
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:40,135
>> Greg: I WANT TO AGREE ON

404
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:40,435
THIS.

405
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:42,103
THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE

406
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,439
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THIS

407
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:46,107
SPECIFIC DEBATE DID NOTHING TO

408
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:47,275
HELP THE DIALOGUE.

409
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,310
INSTEAD HE CREATED TWO SEPARATE

410
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,644
TEAMS.

411
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,513
PRO ANTHEM AND ANTI-ANTHEM.

412
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:52,280
WHEN YOUR EYES LOOK AT SOMETHING

413
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,886
IT HAPPEN, VISUALS ARE THE MOST

414
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:58,386
PERSUADABLE THING.

415
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,221
PEOPLE SEE IT DID NOTHING FOR

416
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:00,655
THE DIALOGUE.

417
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:04,726
ALIENATED SPORTS FANS.

418
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:06,161
IF YOU BELIEVE STANDING FOR THE

419
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,762
ANTHEM OR THE FLAG IS A

420
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:09,397
POLITICAL EVENT, THAT'S ON YOU

421
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:09,964
FOR BEING POLITICAL.

422
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,199
>> Juan: I STAND FOR THE

423
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,333
ANTHEM MYSELF BUT I'M TELLING

424
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,836
YOU THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IS

425
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:15,570
A SITUATION WHERE DONALD TRUMP

426
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,805
HAS FOUND A WAY TO STIR HIS

427
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:18,106
BASE.

428
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:21,142
HIS BASE IS SAYING -- THIS HAS

429
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:21,910
NOTHING TO DO THE

430
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,711
NATIONAL ANTHEM, NOTHING TO DO

431
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,312
WITH THE FLAG.

432
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,114
NOTHING TO DO WITH LOVE OF OUR

433
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:26,447
TROOPS.

434
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:28,216
>> Kimberly: YES, IT DOES.

435
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:29,717
>> Juan: THE NFL

436
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:30,685
PLAYERS ASSOCIATION SAID WE LOVE

437
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:31,586
OUR TROOPS.

438
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,922
WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY.

439
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:34,722
WE LOVE OUR FLAG.

440
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,524
>> Greg: WHY DID THEY HAVE TO

441
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:36,858
DO THAT?

442
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:41,362
THE MESSAGE IS CONVOLUTED.

443
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:42,697
>> Brian: THEY DON'T LIKE

444
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:43,164
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

445
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:44,365
THEY ARE STANDING UP, THEY SAY

446
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:47,902
IT'S POLICE BRUTALITY.

447
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:49,704
>> Juan: BAD COPS, NOT GOOD

448
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:50,004
COMPS.

449
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:51,239
>> Kimberly: THEY HAD TO PUT

450
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,840
THAT STATEMENT OUT BECAUSE IT

451
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,710
WAS PERCEIVED, DISRESPECTFUL.

452
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,711
YES, IT IS.

453
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,313
>> Juan: PUSHED BY

454
00:12:58,313 --> 00:12:59,948
DONALD TRUMP TO STIR UP VOTERS.

455
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:02,517
>> Kimberly: HE WASN'T THE ONE

456
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:02,951
TAKING A KNEE.

457
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,786
>> Brian: HE WASN'T PRESENT

458
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:09,924
WHEN IT STARTED.

459
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:12,026
-- HE WASN'T PRESIDENT WHEN IT

460
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:17,332
STARTED.

461
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:18,499
HERE'S THE THING.

462
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,500
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE WANTS

463
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,535
TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY COME

464
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,103
HE CAN LAY OUT WHAT HE WANTS TO.

465
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:24,739
HE HAS NOT TAKEN ON KIM.

466
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:27,709
IF YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE

467
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:28,910
ECONOMY, HE JUST WOULDN'T TWEET

468
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,111
ABOUT THIS.

469
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:31,412
HE WANTS THIS FIGHT.

470
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:36,484
>> Juan: YES, HE DOES.

471
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:37,418
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELL

472
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:37,452
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELB

473
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:37,485
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELA

474
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:38,453
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELK

475
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:38,486
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELP

476
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:38,519
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELO

477
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:38,553
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELL

478
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:39,387
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELE

479
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:39,420
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELT

480
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:39,721
>> Juan:        HE WANTS TO TELO

481
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:42,290
SHUT UP.

482
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,024
>> Kimberly: LOOK AT THE

483
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:46,060
RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG BLACKS

484
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,162
AND MINORITIES AND WOMEN RIGHT

485
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:48,429
NOW.

486
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:49,931
THAT IS SOMEBODY WHO REALLY

487
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,300
WANTS TO TELL BLACK PEOPLE TO

488
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,768
SHUT UP.

489
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:54,202
[ALL SPEAKING]

490
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:54,902
>> Juan: ARGUMENTS LIKE THAT,

491
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:57,372
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FAX.

492
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:58,373
OH, MY GOD.

493
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,341
>> Kimberly: THIS IS

494
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,111
RIDICULOUS.

495
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,912
>> Brian: CHRIS LONG, WHAT

496
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:05,713
COLOR IS HE?

497
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:06,881
>> Juan: STEVE KERR, ALSO A

498
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:10,451
WHITE GUY.

499
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:11,152
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE FLAG.

500
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:13,688
HE'S USING THIS TO ATTACK A

501
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:14,889
MINORITY GROUP.

502
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,157
>> Kimberly: NO.

503
00:14:16,157 --> 00:14:17,558
HE'S USING THIS AS AN

504
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:18,893
OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK THE

505
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,529
PRESIDENT TO TRY TO CALL HIM

506
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,097
RACIST, TO SAY HE IS AGAINST

507
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:25,333
BLACK PEOPLE WHEN THERE IS NO

508
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,701
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT

509
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:27,101
WHATSOEVER.

510
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:28,603
>> Juan: THE NFL IS ONE OF THE

511
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:29,804
MOST INCLUSIVE WORKPLACES IN

512
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:31,739
AMERICA BUT NOW AS A RESULT OF

513
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:35,576
TRUMP'S INTERFERENCE, IT HAS

514
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:41,516
CORRODED THE RELATIONSHIP.

515
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,117
>> Kimberly: THE WHOLE THING.

516
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:45,987
I THINK THE NFL IS JUST FINE.

517
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:48,723
TEAMS ARE STANDING BY THEIR

518
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:49,657
PLAYERS.

519
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,526
TO TRY TO TYPE THIS INTO

520
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:52,527
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CALL HIM A

521
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:53,761
RACIST AND THAT HE WANTS TO TELL

522
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:54,896
BLACK PEOPLE TO SHUT UP IS JUST

523
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:58,499
COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE.

524
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,701
>> Brian: IF THE POLITICO

525
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,402
STORY IS TRUE, IT LOOKS LIKE A

526
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,304
SCRIPTED EVENT TO EMBARRASS THE

527
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:03,738
PRESIDENT.

528
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:07,342
GIVE ME 85 PASSIVE, 70 PASSES,

529
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:08,943
THE MASCOT AND THE OWNER.

530
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:11,179
IT'S A SCRIPTED ATTEMPT TO

531
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:11,846
EMBARRASS THE WHITE HOUSE.

532
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,014
>> Juan: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE

533
00:15:13,014 --> 00:15:14,248
PLAYERS SHOW UP AND TRUMPED

534
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,551
STAN'S PARENTS IS THESE GUYS ARE

PLEASE.

537
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:19,821
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE USED.

538
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:22,223
>> Kimberly: WHY DID THEY SAY

539
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:24,325
80 ARE GOING TO COME AND THEN

540
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:26,861
MAY PULL -- IT'S LIKE A BAIT AND

541
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:28,730
SWITCH.

542
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,732
HE SHOWS UP AND THERE'S THE

543
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:32,800
GOOFY MASCOT AND POOR JESSE AND

544
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,134
HIS DAD.

545
00:15:33,134 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Greg: THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO
