it's hard for me to give him an A even though on policy certainly I would give the president an A but I think that that the things that he says matter in the moment they can it's fun to celebrate them there he's he's funny he punches all the right people most of the time I think sometimes we ignore that he put me or there are people think some friendly fire but on the on the whole it's fun to watch him be Trump he has put the bully in to bully Bowl but I worry that there's consequences not only do I find it distasteful but I worry that there's consequences and and that brings me to the thing that I'm have the most concern about in the era of Trump and that is not what Trump says or does but what Republicans and conservatives say and do and defensive Trump which is where I think that we have the most liability right now it it bothers me that we can't say that what he does is good when it's good but also say that what he does is bad when it's bad I think that because we have have become so reactionary and partisan in my opinion that we're losing credibility with anyone who doesn't already agree with us about the guy we no longer seem like honest purveyors of an ideological which we can discuss the nature of ideologies but we're no longer purveying an idea I worry that we're only supporting a man and I think that that doesn't work well for conservatism over time yeah it's not it's not traditional conservatism I do think there is a segment of his base that is so rock solid that it's it's impressive but it that worries me too the the fact that he is such a big personality now what if his toxicity actually makes that an unpopular position a much more unpopular position than it was before and you've seen this in all of the areas where he's injected himself into culture so for example the NFL fight which I'm sure you guys celebrated and thought oh this is great so I will show you why I will tell you why I don't think it's great the reason that I don't think it's great is not because I think he's wrong I think he's a hundred percent right obviously the reason that I think that it's that it's bad is that if you look at the opinion polls and I know we're not supposed to pay attention to polls anymore but I think they are reflective of something okay if you look at the opinion polls on how many like my fake news been regardless feel wise enough oh yeah you make you look much wiser now
