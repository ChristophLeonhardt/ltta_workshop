OFFICE BUILDING WHERE BRETT
KAVANAUGH AND HIS ACCUSER
CHRISTINE FORD IN THE HOT SEAT
TESTIFYING BEFORE THE SENATE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
WHAT DO LAWMAKERS WANT TO HEAR?
JIM JORDAN SITS ON THE HOUSE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND JOINS US
FROM CAPITOL HILL.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
THESE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS
DOCTOR FORD HAS MADE.
DEMOCRATS WANT THE PRESIDENT TO
WITHDRAW HIS NAME.
REPUBLICANS ARE FEELING THIS IS
A PARTISAN ATTACK.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT AND
NOT WITHDRAWING HIS NAME.
I HOPE HE GETS CONFIRMED AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE.
REALLY TIME I HAD INTERACTION
WITH BRETT CAVANAGH WAS IN A
SOCIAL SETTING.
YOUNG LADY WHO WAS AN INTERN AND
CLERKED FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH, HE
ATTENDED A WEDDING AND THAT IS
WHERE I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT
WITH HIM AND FOUND HIM TO BE AN
EXCEPTIONAL INDIVIDUAL AND THE
KIND OF GUY WE WENT ON THE
COURT.
THE FACT HE TOOK TIME TO FLY
FROM DC TO MADISON, WISCONSIN TO
ATTEND THE WEDDING OF A YOUNG
LADY WHO WAS A CLICK FRAME
DEMONSTRATES THE KIND OF
INDIVIDUAL HE IS.
I HOPE HE GETS CONFIRMED AS ON
THE COURT SOON.
PETE: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING AT THE 11TH HOUR LIKE
THIS WHERE THERE ARE ALL THESE
ACCUSATIONS?
IN THE LAST 72 HOURS THERE HAVE
BEEN FIVE OTHER ACCUSATIONS
OTHER THAN DOCTOR FORD'S COME
OUT.
WHETHER THEY ARE CREDIBLE OR NOT
IS UP TO THE COMMUNITY TO FIGURE
OUT.
>> IT IS UP TO THE COMMITTEE TO
FIGURE OUT.
I THOUGHT BRETT KAVANAUGH
HANDLED HIMSELF EXTREMELY WELL
IN HIS HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO.
I THINK HE IS SO QUALIFIED AND
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT HIM ON
THE COURT AND THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO PUSH AND MAKE SURE HE
GETS ON THE COURT.
PETE: YOU HAVE NOT BEEN A FAN OF
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD
ROSENSTEIN.
HE WANTED HIM GONE FOR A WHILE.
SOUNDS LIKE THE PRESIDENT WILL
MEET WITH HIM, WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH THIS NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE
AT THE END OF LAST WEEK?
YOU WANT HIM ON CAPITOL HILL.
>> Reporter: THEIR IMPORTANT
QUESTIONS, THIS IS THE GUY WHO
WROTE THE MEMO FOR FIRING COMEY
AND HIRED BOB MUELLER AND SIGNED
THE RENEWAL OF CARTER PAGE, THIS
IS THE GUY WHO ACCORDING TO FOX
NEWS THREATENED HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE STAFFERS,
HE WASN'T GIVEN DOCUMENTS WE
THINK WE ARE ENTITLED TO AND NOW
WE LEARN ROD ROSENSTEIN IS
RUNNING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
IN FRONT OF SUBORDINATES ABOUT
RECORDING THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
AND EVEN IF THERE IS AN IN A
JOKING SARCASTIC WAY THAT IS NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN THIS
COUNTRY.
DEFINITELY HAS TO BE IN FRONT OF
CONGRESS ANSWERING QUESTIONS
ABOUT THAT MEETING.
WHO WAS IN A MEETING?
WAS ANDY MCCABE IN A MEETING?
PROBABLY SO BUT THE ONE WHO
WROTE THE MEMO WAS BRUCE KIM
JONG UN 6, WHO WAS IN A MEETING?
WE NEED HIM ON CAPITOL HILL
ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT
MEETING AND OTHER ISSUES.
>> YOU WERE SPEAKING TO
SUPPORTERS YESTERDAY AND YOU
SAID IF YOU BECAME SPEAKER OF
THE HOUSE NEXT GO AROUND YOU
WOULD GET RID OF OBAMACARE AND
PROMISED TO BUILD THE BORDER
WALL.
THE PRESIDENT HAS CONTROLLED THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY, CONTROLS BOTH
CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THESE
KEY AGENDA ITEMS THE PRESIDENT
ONESS, THEY ARE NOT IN A HURRY
TO GIVE THEM TO US.
>> REPORT THINGS TO KEEP THE
MAJORITY BECAUSE THEN THE
DEMOCRATS ARE CLEAR WHAT THEY
WILL DO, RAISE YOUR TAXES,
SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, IMPEACH THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS AN AMAZING
RECORD OF GETTING THINGS DONE
BUT THE SINGLE BIGGEST PROMISE
WE MADE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN
2016, BUILDING THE BORDER
SECURITY WALLACE HAVEN'T GOT IT
DONE.
WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON GETTING THAT
DONE.
IT COMES DOWN TO POLITICAL WILL.
TO HAVE THE WILL TO FIGHT, HAVE
A SHOWDOWN, HAVE A NATIONAL
DEBATE WE HAVE TO HAVE IN
CONGRESS AND TO WIN THE ISSUE.
