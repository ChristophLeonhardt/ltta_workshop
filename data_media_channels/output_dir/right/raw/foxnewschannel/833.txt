1
00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:01,731
GOING ON AND IGNORED FOR DECADE

2
00:00:01,731 --> 00:00:02,064
DECADES.

3
00:00:02,064 --> 00:00:03,132
>> Jesse: SO TAKE THE CARAVAN

4
00:00:03,132 --> 00:00:07,603
COMING NORTH AND SEND IT SOUTH?

5
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:10,606
REFRESHMENTS AND CLEAN CLOTHES.

6
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:11,941
>> Jesse: DONNA BRAZILE,

7
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:13,809
WELCOME TO "THE FIVE."

8
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,045
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T

9
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,446
KNOW MY NUMBER.

10
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:18,180
>> Jesse: SORRY.

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,315
I MUST HAVE LOST IT.

12
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:20,850
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WANTING TO

13
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,251
TALK ABOUT THE IG REPORT BECAUSE

14
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:22,985
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING IT FOR

15
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:25,221
HOURS BUT WE ARE GOING TO TALK

16
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:28,791
ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION SITUATION.

17
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,592
SECRETARY NIELSEN SAID THERE'S

18
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:30,926
LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT ENCOURAGE

19
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:31,227
THIS.

20
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:34,063
THERE'S A 2008 CHILD TRAFFIC

21
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:37,733
INVOLVING ABUSE.

22
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,101
THERE IS THE FLOREZ DEAL,

23
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:39,802
CLIFTON ADMINISTRATION POLICY.

24
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:42,605
YOU CAN'T DETAIN MINERS FOR MORE

25
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:43,038
THAN 20 DAYS.

26
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:45,775
THEN YOU HAVE THE ASYLUM LAWS

27
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:46,909
ABUSE.

28
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:50,579
DON'T PAST ADMINISTRATIONS BEAR

29
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,715
SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS?

30
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:53,415
>> Donna: YES AND NO.

31
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:54,216
YES IN THE SENSE THAT YOU HAVE

32
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:57,520
THESE LAWS ON THE BOOKS, 1997

33
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:57,953
AND 2008 LAW.

34
00:00:57,953 --> 00:00:59,889
THE DIFFERENCES THIS IS A CHANGE

35
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,559
IN POLICY, A CHANGE IN

36
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:04,693
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW.

37
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:06,962
EVERYONE WHO COMES NOW IS

38
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:10,766
TREATED AS A CRIMINAL.

39
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:11,767
AND THEY ARE SUBJECT TO

40
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:12,401
PROSECUTION.

41
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:15,471
WHILE THE '97 LOSS THAT YOU HAD

42
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:18,207
20 DAYS TO DEAL WITH THESE

43
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:19,408
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS.

44
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:20,976
THIS IS A POLICY CHANGE THAT

45
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:23,979
SAYS WE ARE GOING TO SEPARATE

46
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,381
THESE CHILDREN FROM PARENTS WHO

47
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,583
ARE GOING TO FACE CRIMINAL

48
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:27,983
PROSECUTION.

49
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:29,985
SO I THINK THE TRUMP

50
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:30,653
ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO WORK

51
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:33,656
WITH CONGRESS, PERHAPS THEY WILL

52
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:34,323
DO IT WITH THE IMMIGRATION

53
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:37,326
DEBATE THEY WILL HAVE.

54
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:40,396
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO

55
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:43,098
PUT TOGETHER A SOLUTION.

56
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:44,800
FOR NOW THERE IS NO FEDERAL LAW

57
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,467
THAT SAYS YOU MUST SEPARATE

58
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:50,606
CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES.

59
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:52,408
>> Jesse: YOU DON'T WANT THE

60
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:53,042
CHILDREN TO BE POTENTIALLY

61
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:54,810
ABUSED AND YOU DON'T KNOW

62
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,012
WHETHER OR NOT THE CHILDREN ARE

63
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:58,414
ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE ADULT

64
00:01:58,414 --> 00:02:00,115
BRINGING HIM ACROSS THE BORDER

65
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:01,317
BECAUSE THE SECRETARY SAID

66
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:03,853
THERE'S BEEN OVER A 300%

67
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:06,789
INCREASE OF FRAUDULENT FAMILIES.

68
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:08,190
CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER.

69
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,991
>> Kimberly: THAT'S AN

70
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,092
ALARMING NUMBER WHEN YOU HEAR

71
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:10,793
THAT.

72
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:12,928
YOU THINK ABOUT, THAT'S FRAUGHT

73
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:14,463
WITH PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF RISKS

74
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:16,498
TO CHILDREN AND BEING IN DANGER.

75
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:18,200
VERY MUCH A CONCERN IN TERMS OF

76
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,635
HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

77
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:20,836
OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY CARES AND

78
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:21,670
PEOPLE DON'T WANT FAMILIES

79
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,239
SEPARATED FROM THE CHILDREN BUT

80
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,474
YOU DO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

81
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:27,042
DETERMINE THE TRUE IDENTITY OF

82
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:29,411
THE INDIVIDUALS COMING OVER JUST

83
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:30,446
BECAUSE AN ADULT IS ACCOMPANIED

84
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:32,581
WITH A MINOR, YOU CAN'T MAKE THE

85
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:35,584
ASSUMPTION THAT THEY ARE IN FACT

86
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:36,785
RELATED BECAUSE QUITE THE

87
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:37,386
CONTRARY.

88
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:39,788
THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS OTHERWISE.

89
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:41,290
THAT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE AND

90
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,892
RECKLESS AND A MATTER OF PUBLIC

91
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:44,627
SAFETY AND ENDANGERMENT TO CHILD

92
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:45,261
SAFETY AND ENDANGERMENT TO CHIL

93
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:45,561
CHILD.

94
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:48,030
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE.

95
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,498
I THINK THE LEGISLATURE DOES

96
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,635
NEED TO ACT ON IT EXPEDITIOUSLY.

97
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:55,804
TO DO SO AND WORK COOPERATIVELY

98
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:56,538
WITH THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

99
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:58,874
OBVIOUSLY THE GOOD NEWS IS THE

100
00:02:58,874 --> 00:02:59,541
ISSUE IS GETTING A LOT OF

101
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,577
ATTENTION AND FOCUS AND LIGHT ON

102
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:02,478
IT SO THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING

103
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:04,813
ABOUT IT.

104
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:06,415
THIS IS A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS

105
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:07,416
BUT NEVERTHELESS WE'VE GOT TO

106
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:11,153
ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE HERE

107
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,354
AND OBSERVE THE LAWS ON THE

108
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:12,955
BOOKS.

109
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:15,524
>> Jesse: HOW DO YOU THINK THE

110
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:16,225
WHITE HOUSE, DANA, I WOULDN'T

111
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,693
CALL IT A CRISIS BUT IT'S

112
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,861
REACHING A BOILING POINT.

113
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:20,396
>> Dana: I THINK IT WAS SMART

114
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:22,431
TO HAVE THE PRINCIPAL THERE

115
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,032
TODAY AT THE BRIEFING.

116
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:24,733
IT TOOK HER A WHILE TO GET BACK.

117
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,335
I UNDERSTAND THEY HAD A MEETING

118
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,003
AT 3:00 WITH THE PRESIDENT.

119
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:28,871
IT'S TENSE WITHIN THE

120
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,772
WHITE HOUSE.

121
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:30,739
THEY REALIZE THEY HAVE A

122
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:31,073
PROBLEM.

123
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:35,844
I WAS APPRISED.

124
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:37,212
SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE,

125
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:38,247
EVEN A WEEK AGO, THAT THEY

126
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:39,415
NEEDED TO GET IN FRONT OF IT.

127
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:43,919
NOW YOU HAVE THESE PHOTOGRAPHS,

128
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,955
SOME RELEASED FROM DHS, HHS,

129
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:48,424
REPORTERS, CONGRESS.

130
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:50,192
THE PHOTOGRAPHS DRIVE A LOT OF

131
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:50,526
THINGS.

132
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:52,428
YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE LITTLE BOY

133
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:58,133
WAS KILLED, THE MIGRANT BOY, HE

134
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,035
WASHED UP ON THE COAST OF

135
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:00,369
TURKEY.

136
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:01,603
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE CAN'T

137
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:02,438
HAVE THIS.

138
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,239
IT'S NOT THAT IT WASN'T

139
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,207
HAPPENING TO A LOT OF CHILDREN.

140
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,509
IT'S JUST THAT PHOTOGRAPHS MAKE

141
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,410
A BIG DIFFERENCE.

142
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,445
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN WAS ASKED, WHAT

143
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:10,612
ABOUT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS.

144
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:12,247
SHE SAID I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM.

145
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:13,449
I THINK HER STAFF CLOSER TO HER

146
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,818
TO MAKE SURE SHE SEES THEM SO

147
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:17,286
SHE'S AWARE OF WHAT EVERYBODY

148
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:17,987
OUT THERE IS SEEING AND WHY

149
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:23,325
THERE'S ALL THIS REACTION.

150
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,427
A LOT OF IT IS BASED ON

151
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:27,429
MISREPORTING.

152
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:28,897
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

153
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:30,399
CHILDREN ARE BEING HELD IN CAGES

154
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,435
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

155
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:34,136
PHOTOGRAPHS, THERE ARE

156
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:34,837
CHAIN-LINK PARTITIONS.

157
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:36,939
THEY ARE BEING COVERED WITH

158
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,007
SILVER MYLAR BLANKETS AND THEN

159
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:40,109
YOU HEAR THE PRO-PUBLIC AUDIO

160
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:40,909
SECRETLY RECORDED, MAY BE

161
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:43,145
INAPPROPRIATE THAT THE AUDIO IS

162
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:46,215
GOING TO PULL AT HEARTSTRINGS

163
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:46,648
HEARTSTRINGS.

164
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:47,316
I THINK TOMORROW WHEN THE

165
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:48,083
PRESIDENT GOES TO CONGRESS COME

166
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,019
HE'S GOING TO SAY I'M GOING TO

167
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,020
SUPPORT THESE IMMIGRATION BILLS.

168
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,921
I WANT YOU TO PASS THEM.

169
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:54,223
I HOPE IT IS SUCCESSFUL.

170
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:57,226
I AM SKEPTICAL, IN A WAY, PARTLY

171
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:58,961
BECAUSE I HEARD TODAY THAT ONE

172
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,661
OF THE PEOPLE IN LEADERSHIP

173
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:02,197
THINKS IT HAS A 10% CHANCE OF

174
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:02,898
PASSING THE HOUSE AND THAT A

175
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:05,934
BILL VERY SIMILAR RECENTLY HELD

176
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,803
IN THE SENATE ONLY GOT 40 VOTES.

177
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,838
SO I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

178
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:11,340
HAVE TO REVERSE A POLICY OR

179
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,374
FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO DEAL

180
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,876
WITH IT WHILE THEY TRY TO DO

181
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:14,676
SOMETHING WITH CONGRESS BECAUSE

182
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:16,211
NOW YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

183
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:16,979
CONGRESS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

184
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,180
PASS ANYTHING.

185
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,317
>> Jesse:   GREAT COMEDY THINK

186
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:23,819
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HANG

187
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:24,920
TOUGH ON THIS ISSUE LIKE HE DOES

188
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,588
IN THE FACE OF OUTRAGE OR DO YOU

189
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:29,425
THINK IS GOING TO COME TO THE

190
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:29,725
TABLE?

191
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:30,359
>> Greg: I THINK HE LIKES

192
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,660
SOLVING PROBLEMS AND I THINK HE

193
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,461
WOULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IF HE

194
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:32,828
CAN.

195
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:34,129
I DON'T THINK THE OTHER SIDE

196
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,564
WANTS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

197
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:41,236
BECAUSE IT'S ONE HELL OF AN

198
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:41,937
ISSUE.

199
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,138
IT'S A HAMMER YOU CAN POUND THE

200
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:43,639
WHITE HOUSE WITH.

201
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,941
IF YOU TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE,

202
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:48,143
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR THE

203
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:49,211
DEMOCRATS.

204
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:52,014
I AM SO TIRED, THOUGH, PEOPLE

205
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:53,816
IMPLYING THAT OUR AGENTS ARE

206
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:54,416
CHILD ABUSERS.

207
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,653
THIS IS SOMETHING WE LET FLY BY.

208
00:05:57,653 --> 00:05:59,421
PEOPLE ARE DOING THEIR BEST.

209
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,622
THIS, IMAGINE SOMEBODY COMING TO

210
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:02,691
YOUR HOUSE AND DROPPING OFF

211
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:03,258
KIDS.

212
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:04,993
YOU TRY TO DO YOUR BEST.

213
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:06,195
THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS DOING.

214
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:08,597
THEY ARE DEALING WITH THOUSANDS

215
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:08,931
OF KIDS.

216
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:13,402
YOU HAVE GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN

217
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:14,803
COMPARING IT TO THE HOLOCAUST,

218
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:16,939
CANCELLATION CAMPS, AND INSULT

219
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,907
TO VICTIMS, SURVIVORS, PEOPLE

220
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:20,209
TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS.

221
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:20,776
THAT IS IDIOTIC.

222
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:24,213
HE IS A FOOL.

223
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:24,847
>> Donna: THE STRESS, THE

224
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:30,953
HARM, THE ABUSE THAT COMES WHEN

225
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:32,054
YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE OF HOLDING

226
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:32,454
YOUR CHILD.

227
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:35,557
YOUR PULLED AWAY, YOU'RE PULLING

228
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:36,825
MY PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN.

229
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,260
A MAN COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE

230
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,895
HE DID NOT WANT TO LET GO OF HIS

231
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:41,797
KID.

232
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:42,397
THIS IS A CRISIS.

233
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,266
>> Greg: IT'S IN EMOTIONAL

234
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,134
FEELING.

235
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:45,501
I GET IT.

236
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,202
>> Donna: WHEN IT COMES TO --

237
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:49,304
I'M NOT AN EMOTIONAL PERSON.

238
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:52,808
>> Greg: [LAUGHS]

239
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:55,844
>> Donna: WHEN I KNOW, THE

240
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:56,578
DEMOCRATS, SINCE YOU MENTION,

241
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:57,980
THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN

242
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,280
ISSUE.

243
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,016
THESE ARE CHILDREN.

244
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:01,683
REGARDLESS OF WHAT MISTAKES

245
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:04,620
THEIR PARENTS ARE MAKING, THEIR

246
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,320
CARETAKER, THESE ARE CHILDREN.

247
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,388
WE SHOULD HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE

248
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:11,660
IN OUR HEART FOR THE CHILDREN.

249
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,096
29 COSPONSORS OF A BILL.

250
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,231
>> Jesse: WHAT IS THE

251
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:17,032
DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION?

252
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:18,734
YOU HAVE A 40-YEAR-OLD MIGRANT

253
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:21,403
FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.

254
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:23,739
CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER

255
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,140
WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

256
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,275
NO DOCUMENTATION THEY ARE

257
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,242
RELATED.

258
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:28,877
WHAT IS THE BORDER PATROL

259
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:30,445
SUPPOSED TO DO, ACCORDING TO A

260
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:34,449
DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION?

261
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,384
>> Donna: THE SOLUTION IS WE

262
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:36,451
HAVE TO VET THE PEOPLE COMING

263
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:39,821
HERE, WHETHER THEY ARE SEEKING

264
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:40,189
ASYLUM --

265
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:42,090
>> Jesse: HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

266
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,791
>> Donna: THAT'S WHAT BORDER

267
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,626
AGENTS ARE PAID TO DO.

268
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,028
>> Jesse: THIS IS PART OF THE

269
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:46,728
VETTING PROCESS.

270
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,430
YOU MAKE SURE THEY ARE RELATED.

271
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,733
>> Donna: THIS IS A CHANGE IN

272
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:52,401
POLICY, CHANGE AND

273
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:52,834
PROSECUTING --

274
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,203
>> Jesse: YOU WANT TO GO BACK

275
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:55,404
TO CATCH AND RELEASE?

276
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,372
>> Donna: I AM SAYING IT'S A

277
00:07:57,372 --> 00:07:59,575
MISDEMEANOR VERSES PUTTING THEM

278
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:01,410
THROUGH THIS OTHER LEGAL

279
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:01,777
RIGMAROLE.

280
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:02,578
>> Jesse: IT'S TO SAY YOU'VE

281
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:05,447
BROKEN THE LAW AND CROSSED THE

282
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:06,215
BORDER.

283
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:07,216
YOU ARE GOING BACK HOME.

284
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:09,618
NOT SHOW UP IN A MONTH TO A

285
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:12,254
JUDGE IN THE 90% NEVER SHOW UP.

286
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:13,689
>> Donna: WE ALL AGREE THE

287
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:16,525
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

288
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,227
I'M NOT HERE TO SAY IT'S NOT.

289
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:18,760
IT'S BROKEN.

290
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,062
ALL I'M SAYING IS WE HAVE A

291
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:22,030
CRISIS RIGHT NOW.

292
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,831
DANA IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

293
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:25,234
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING.

294
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:25,867
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

295
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:27,202
SECURITY SHOULD'VE SEEN IT

296
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:27,536
COMING.

297
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:28,770
JEFF SESSIONS SHOULD HAVE SEEN

298
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,738
IT COMING, AND CLEARLY

299
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:31,406
DONALD TRUMP SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT

300
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:32,174
COMING.

301
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:32,874
>> Jesse: THE ONE THING THAT

302
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:34,876
SOLVES THE PROBLEM IS THE WALL.

303
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:37,511
WHEN THERE IS A WALL, THEY CAN'T

304
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:38,246
CROSS ILLEGALLY AND FAMILIES GET

305
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:39,815
TO STAY TOGETHER.

306
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:42,083
>> Greg: THE WALL UNITES

307
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,018
PEOPLE.

308
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:44,987
>> Kimberly: BARRIER DEFENSE.

309
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:45,787
EVERY COUNTRY HAS A RIGHT TO BE

310
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:49,024
ABLE TO PROTECT ITS BORDERS AND

311
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:50,626
MAKE SURE LAW AND ORDER IS BEING

312
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:51,727
OBSERVED.

313
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:52,494
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALSO HAVE

314
00:08:52,494 --> 00:08:55,130
TO FACTOR IN ANOTHER INTEREST

315
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,298
HERE IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE

316
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:57,432
CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR.

317
00:08:57,432 --> 00:00:00,000
