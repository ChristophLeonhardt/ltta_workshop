FINAL CONFIRMATION VOTE.
>> Harris: MIKE EMANUEL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
A SOURCE IS TELLING FOX NEWS NOW
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS
CONFIDENT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH
HAS THE VOTES TO BE CONFIRMED TO
THE HIGH COURT.
FOX TOP STORY WITH A BIG
INTERVIEW WAS FIRST, WHITE HOUSE
PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS.
AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME
TODAY.
>> Secretary Sanders:
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON
TODAY, ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.
>> Harris: LET'S START WITH
THE BIG NEWS THAT YOU HAVE THE
VOTES, WHY?
>> Secretary Sanders: WE FEEL
GREAT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT
NOW, OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LOVE TO
SEE ALL 100 SENATORS GET BEHIND
AND SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, BUT
WE THINK THE VOTE THAT TOOK
PLACE THIS MORNING WAS CERTAINLY
A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HIM
CONFIRM LATER THIS WEEKEND.
>> Harris: WE ARE WAITING FOR
SOME MORE NEWS TO BREAK.
WE ARE HEARING FROM SENATOR JEFF
FLAKE THAT HE IS A "YES" AND
LESS SOMETHING BIG WERE TO
CHANGE AND WE CAN IMAGINE WHAT
THAT WOULD BE.
SUSAN COLLINS, ANOTHER
REPUBLICAN ON THE FENCE AND ALL
OF THIS IS A POST TO LET US
KNOW, THE WORLD, THE NATION HOW
SHE WILL VOTE AT 3:00.
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT DOING ON
THIS FRIDAY HAS THIS NEWS IS
TRICKLING IN?
>> Secretary Sanders: THE
PRESIDENT IS OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF
EVERYTHING THAT IS TAKING PLACE.
AT THE SAME TIME, THIS IS A
PRESIDENT WHO LIKES TO DO A LOT
OF THINGS AT ONE TIME.
IT IS GOING TO BE SIGNING PIECES
OF LEGISLATION LATER TODAY,
CONTINUING MEETINGS WITH STAFF,
BUT WE ARE WATCHING THIS VERY
CLOSELY AND CERTAINLY THOSE OF
US AT THE WHITE HOUSE WILL BE
TUNED IN TO HEAR
SENATOR COLLINS' SPEECH LATER
THIS AFTERNOON.
WE THINK ARE VOTE EARLIER THIS
MORNING WAS A GREAT THING AND WE
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT SHE WILL
FOLLOW SUIT OF WHAT SHE DID THIS
MORNING AND DO THAT AGAIN IN THE
FINAL VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
>> Harris: IT'S INTERESTING,
HISTORICALLY A VOTE FOR CLOSURE
IS SOMETIMES AN INDICATION OF
HOW AN INDIVIDUAL WILL VOTE
MOVING FORWARD.
AFTER WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE RECENTLY IN
LAST FEW DAYS, WE CAN'T REALLY
DETERMINE THAT BY HISTORY SO
MUCH ANYMORE.
WHAT IS THE STRATEGY OF THE
WHITE HOUSE NOW, REPORTS THAT
THE PRESIDENT AND WHITE HOUSE
STAFF, WHO ARE YOU TALKING WITH?
>> Secretary Sanders: WE HAVE
BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH
MANY SENATORS IS THE PROCESS
BEGAN AND WE ARE GOING TO
CONTINUE THOSE EFFORTS RIGHT UP
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE BECAUSE IT
IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN
OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY AND WE
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET THE
FINAL VOTE DONE AND GET JUDGE
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED AND WE HOPE
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND.
>> Harris: THE TIMING OF IT IS
WHEN MANY AMERICANS WILL BE ABLE
TO PAUSE ON A WEEKEND AND TAKE A
LOOK AT HISTORY BEING MADE UP OR
DOWN ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH, SO THE
TIMING OF IT IS INTERESTING.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING,
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF YOU GOT
EVERYBODY?
AND IT WAS A DAY WHEN YOU GET
90% OF THE SENATORS TO PUT THEIR
POLITICS ASIDE, AND YOU SEE DEMS
AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER.
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT JOE
MANCHIN WAS A "YES" TO MOVE THE
NOMINATION PROCESS FORWARD, A
DEMOCRAT FROM WEST VIRGINIA?
>> Secretary Sanders: FRANKLY,
I'M SURPRISED MORE DEMOCRATS
AREN'T SUPPORTING JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE VERY
BEGINNING THE IMPECCABLE
QUALIFICATIONS THAT HE HAS AND
YOU ARE VERY RIGHT IN SAYING
THAT THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A
PARTISAN BATTLE.
THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A
POLITICAL BATTLE.
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A
DETERMINATION ON WHETHER OR NOT
SOMEBODY HAD THE RIGHT
TEMPERATURE, THE RIGHT
QUALIFICATIONS TO SIT ON THE
SUPREME COURT AND EVERYTHING YOU
SHOULD SEE IN A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE IN BRETT KAVANAUGH AND
IT IS A SHAME THAT IT HAS BECOME
A POLITICAL BATTLE AND IT'S NO
LONGER ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT
BUT IT'S ABOUT PARTISAN POLITIC
POLITICS.
LOSING THE DEMOCRATS PLAY JUST A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME THAT
HAS EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AND
THAT'S A REAL DISGRACE TO THE
COUNTRY, A DISGRACE TO THE
PROCESS, BUT HOPEFULLY MAYBE
SOME OF THEM WILL CHANGE THEIR
MIND AND GET ON BOARD INTO THE
RIGHT THING TO HAVE HOW THIS
PROCESS MOVING FORWARD OVER THE
WEEKEND AND BE PART OF THE GROUP
THAT HELPS CONFIRM JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
>> Harris: I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ALSO WHAT WAS A SURPRISE
IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS, AND
THUS TO SEE AN OPINION PIECE BY
THE NOMINEE ON THE EVE OF A
VOTE.
WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE THINK
ABOUT THIS SO-CALLED CLOSING
ARGUMENT AND WHETHER IT WAS
NEEDED?
>> Secretary Sanders: JUDGE
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT
THROUGHOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE
PROCESS.
HE HAS PUT FORWARD MORE
DOCUMENTATION, MORE PAPER, MORE
HOURS OF TESTIMONY THAN ANY
OTHER NOMINEE IN HISTORY.
THIS IS ANOTHER MOMENT OF HIM
SAYING I'M AN OPEN BOOK, I'VE
BEEN TRANSPARENT FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THIS ENTIRE
PROCESS, I'M GOING TO CONTINUE
TO BE THAT WAY, AND YOU CAN
EXPECT THAT SAME TYPE OF
MENTALITY AND TEMPERAMENT WHEN I
SIT ON THE COURT.
THE WEATHER SEEMS TO BE A SHIFT
IN DEMOCRATS CRITICISM OF THE
JUDGE GOING FROM THE ALLEGATIONS
JUDGE GOING FROM THE ALLEGATIONO
JUDGE GOING FROM THE ALLEGATIONF
MISCONDUCT AGAINST HIM
TO HOW EMOTIONAL HE GOT
PAID AND IN THE OP-ED LAST
NIGHT, KAVANAUGH SAID I WAS VERY
EMOTIONAL LAST THURSDAY, MORE
THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN.
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL
AT TIMES.
I KNOW THAT MY TONE WAS SHARP
AND I SAID A FEW THINGS I SHOULD
NOT HAVE SAID.
IS THAT HELPFUL?
>> Secretary Sanders: FOR ME,
I THINK THAT IN A MOMENT WHERE
IF YOU FEEL YOU WERE BEING
WRONGFULLY ACCUSED, YOU ARE
DEFENDING NOT JUST YOURSELF, BUT
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FAMILY'S NAME
AND FRANKLY THE ENTIRE PROCESS
THAT ALLOWS SOMEBODY TO BECOME A
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT       RIGHT TO BE EO
EVERY RIGHT       RIGHT TO BE EI
EVERY RIGHT       RIGHT TO BE EN
EVERY RIGHT       RIGHT TO BE EL
EVERY RIGHT       RIGHT TO BE E,
EVERY RIGHT TO BE TOUGH, EVERY
RIGHT TO FIGHT BACK AND DEFEND
YOURSELF AGAINST THOSE
ACCUSATIONS.
I THOUGHT HIS TONE IN LAST
WEEK'S HEARING WAS EXACTLY WHAT
YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM SOMEBODY
GOING THROUGH WHAT BRETT
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY HAVE
BEEN THROUGH OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL WEEKS, AND I THINK HE IS
GOING TO MAKE A GREAT
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHEN WE
SEE HIS CONFIRMATION GO THROUGH
LATER THIS WEEKEND.
>> Harris: WE ARE LETTING
SOMETIME BETWEEN 3:30      3:30.
EASTERN WITH THE NATION IN THE
WORLD WATCHING, WE WILL SEE A
VOTE ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD
ON WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF
THE PRESIDENT BUILDING A LEGACY.
>> Secretary Sanders: THIS
WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST
IMPACTFUL THINGS HE DOES.
THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD AN
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL FIRST TWO
YEARS IN OFFICE.
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, HE'S
MAKING TRADE DEALS THAT PEOPLE
SAID WERE NEVER GOING TO BE
POSSIBLE.
HE IS SECURING THE BORDER, HE IS
DOING ONE THING AFTER THE NEXT
THAT HE PROMISED TO DO ON THE
CAMPAIGN AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE TAKE PLACE THIS WEEKEND
IS ANOTHER FULFILLMENT OF THE
PRESIDENT'S PROMISE TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HE MADE AND
I HOPE WE WILL ALSO SEE THAT
REFLECTED IN PEOPLE WANTED TO
CONTINUE THAT PROGRESS WHEN THEY
VOTE IN NOVEMBER.
TO BE WHAT I AM LOOKING AT THAT
49 YEAR LOW OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT BRINGING THE
COUNTRY TOGETHER AFTER THIS IS
ALL OVER, THAT'S WHERE WE
ALL HOPE THAT WE CAN GET.
NO MATTER HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT
