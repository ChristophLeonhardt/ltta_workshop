00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:12,027
>> Tucker: A SIGNIFICANT STORY

2
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:12,928
THE MEDIA HAVE ALL BUT IGNORED.

3
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:14,429
HE SOUTH AFRICA IS A DIVERSE

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,764
COUNTRY BUT THE SOUTH AFRICAN

5
00:00:15,764 --> 00:00:16,731
GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT

6
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,301
MUCH LESS DIVERSE.

7
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:22,904
IN EMBATTLED MINORITY OF FARMERS

8
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:24,940
IS BEING TARGETED IN A WAVE OF

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,942
BARBARIC AND HORRIFYING MURDERS.

10
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,810
BUT INSTEAD OF PROTECTING THEM,

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,545
THE GOVERNMENT JUST PASSED A LAW

12
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:32,080
ALLOWING IT TO SEIZE THEIR FARMS

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,649
WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION BASED

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,151
PURELY ON THEIR ETHNICITY AND

15
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,785
DISTRIBUTE THOSE TWO MORE

16
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:38,920
FAVORED GROUPS.

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,621
THOUSANDS OF ALREADY MIGRATED

18
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:43,525
OUT OF THE COUNTRY BUT THEY

19
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:44,159
STRUGGLED TO ATTRACT ANY

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,929
SYMPATHY ABROAD FOR SOME REASON.

21
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:50,332
DEPUTY CEO OF THE SOUTH AFRICA

22
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:50,865
CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP.

23
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:51,600
HE WAS JUST IN THE UNITED STATES

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,401
TO MEET WITH A NUMBER OF

25
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:53,969
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

26
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,737
ALSO TOOK A MOMENT TO TALK TO

27
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:56,004
US.

28
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:59,541
HERE'S PART OF WHAT HE SAID.

29
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,175
>> THANKS FOR COMING ON.

30
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:02,544
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

31
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:03,211
>> Tucker: WHAT YOU DESCRIBE

32
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,314
IN THIS BOOK, IT IS ORGANIZED

33
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,916
BUT IN SOME SENSE INTENTIONAL

34
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,619
CAMPAIGN TO CRUSH A RACIAL

35
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,053
MINORITY WITHIN YOUR COUNTRY AND

36
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:14,322
THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS ONBOARD

37
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:15,123
WITH IT.

38
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:16,324
IS THAT AN OVERSTATEMENT?

39
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,893
>> WITH THE BOOK IS ABOUT, IT'S

40
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:22,330
ABOUT GOVERNMENT COMPLICITY IN

41
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,999
THE FORM OF ATTACKS AND MURDERS.

42
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,534
THE LAST TWO DECADES THERE HAVE

43
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:27,202
BEEN -- WE BELIEVE WE HAVE

44
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:28,870
REASON TO SAY IT'S MAY BE

45
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,639
DOWNPLAYED A LITTLE.

46
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:34,109
THERE'S BEEN ABOUT TO GO FARM

47
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:35,977
ATTACKS EVERY DAY AND TWO FARM

48
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:38,513
MURDERS EVERY WEEK IN

49
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:41,516
SOUTH AFRICA AND IN THE BOOK I

50
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:42,717
HIGHLIGHT ACTUALLY TEN DIFFERENT

51
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:43,518
REASONS WHY WE THINK THE

52
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:45,720
GOVERNMENT IS COMPLACENT.

53
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,923
IT STRETCHES FROM REASONS

54
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:52,327
INCLUDING -- FOR EXAMPLE IN 2007

55
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:54,663
IT WAS A 25% INCREASE IN THESE

56
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:55,764
ATTACKS AND THE SOUTH AFRICAN

57
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:56,498
GOVERNMENT RESPONDED SAYING WE

58
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:57,399
ARE NOT GOING TO RELEASE ANY

59
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,567
MORE STATISTICS ABOUT THIS.

60
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,803
AND ALSO, WHICH IS VERY

61
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:04,372
CONCERNING IS THE HATE SPEECH IN

62
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:04,806
SOUTH AFRICA.

63
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:06,908
THAT'S THE TITLE OF THE BOOK AS

64
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:07,509
WELL.

65
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,144
IT'S A VERY POPULAR SONG WHICH

66
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:12,313
IS STILL BEING SUNG.

67
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:15,517
IT SUNG AT POLITICAL RALLIES AND

68
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:16,785
ITS REFERRING TO A PARTICULAR

69
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:21,122
CULTURAL GROUP IN SOUTH AFRICA.

70
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:22,724
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS IN

71
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:23,058
WHICH --

72
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,126
>> Tucker: I THOUGHT THAT HATE

73
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:26,361
SPEECH WAS NOW A CRIME

74
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:28,129
PUNISHABLE BY PRISON TIME IN

75
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:28,930
SOUTH AFRICA.

76
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,664
ARE ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAY

77
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:33,568
THIS ARRESTED?

78
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,770
>> TO HAVE HATE SPEECH DECLARED

79
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,573
CRIME PUNISHABLE BY PRISON TIME,

80
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:39,641
THERE'S A BILL ON THE TABLE.

81
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,109
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOTIVATION

82
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:43,945
AROUND IT, IT'S CLEAR THAT, VERY

83
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:44,746
CLEAR THAT GOVERNMENT ARE

84
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:45,980
PUSHING THIS DON'T REGARD THIS

85
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,481
AS HATE SPEECH.

86
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:47,849
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THEY'VE

87
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:49,250
BEEN ARGUING THAT IT'S NOT HATE

88
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,151
SPEECH IN COURT.

89
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:50,919
THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE

90
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,655
A RIGHT TO SING ABOUT KILLING

91
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:54,456
FARMERS AND THEY WOULD SAY IT'S

92
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,591
AN EXPRESSION OF FREEDOM OF

93
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:56,925
SPEECH.

94
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:57,492
>> Tucker: SO NOW THE

95
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:00,528
GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT

96
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:01,963
PLANS TO PURSUE A POLICY OF

97
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:03,131
TAKING LAND AWAY FROM PEOPLE ON

98
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:04,432
THE BASIS OF THEIR SKIN COLOR.

99
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:07,736
DO YOU THINK WILL DO THAT?

100
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:09,938
>> THAT IS WHAT IS ADOPTED IN

101
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:10,839
OUR PARLIAMENT.

102
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:14,309
A MEASURE WAS ADOPTED THAT THE

103
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:15,043
CONSTITUTION HAS TO BE CHANGED

104
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:18,747
TO ALLOW FOR THE PRIVATE

105
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:21,149
PROPERTY WITHOUT COMPENSATION.

106
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:22,917
SAY THAT THIS WOULD TURN

107
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:23,651
SOUTH AFRICA INTO THE ULTIMATE

108
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,053
PARADISE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN

109
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:26,821
AND DEPUTY PRESIDENT EVEN WENT

110
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:30,358
FURTHER SAYING THAT HE IS

111
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:31,559
BASICALLY TELLING WHITE FARMERS

112
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,961
THAT IF THEY DO NOT VOLUNTARILY

113
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:34,529
HAND OVER THEIR LAND TO BLACK

114
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:35,163
PEOPLE AND THERE WILL BE A

115
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,332
VIOLENT TAKEOVER.

116
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:39,300
THE SITUATION IS VERY DIRE IN

117
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,934
SOUTH AFRICA.

118
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:41,436
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE

119
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:42,771
IS STILL A PROCESS THAT HAS TO

120
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:44,372
BE FOLLOWED AND THAT'S WHY WE

121
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:45,006
ARE IN THE UNITED STATES.

122
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,040
>> Tucker: WHAT I FIND SO

123
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,911
STRIKING IS THE RESPONSE FROM

124
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:51,846
EVERYONE ELSE AROUND THE WORLD.

125
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:52,514
THERE'S ALMOST NORMAL SNOW

126
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:55,316
COVERED THE AMERICAN MEDIA.

127
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:56,951
THE DESERVE IT BECAUSE OF WHAT

128
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:57,552
THEIR ANCESTORS DID.

129
00:03:57,552 --> 00:03:59,254
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS

130
00:03:59,254 --> 00:03:59,854
SIMILARLY SILENT.

131
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,656
HAVE YOU MET WITH ANY GOVERNMENT

132
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:02,557
OFFICIALS HERE IN WASHINGTON

133
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:04,159
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR

134
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,492
COUNTRY?

135
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:05,560
>> THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE.

136
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,662
WE ARE ABOUT TO MEET WITH SOME

137
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:08,463
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND IT'S

138
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,799
VERY UNFORTUNATE, THE SITUATION

139
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,667
THAT YOU'VE JUST MENTIONED.

140
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,269
ESPECIALLY IN SOUTH AFRICA IF

141
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,270
THERE'S A HIERARCHY OF

142
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,670
RECOGNITION.

143
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,005
SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE THE

144
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:18,238
VICTIMS IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS

145
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,107
AND YOU HEAR ABOUT IT FREQUENTLY

146
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:22,844
AND OTHER PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY

147
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,779
FARMERS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WHITE

148
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:25,346
FARMERS IN PARTICULAR.

149
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:27,282
THEY WILL BE TORTURED TO DEATH

150
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:28,850
AND IT RECEIVES VERY LITTLE NEWS

151
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,551
COVERAGE AND THAT'S

152
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:30,485
UNFORTUNATELY THE SITUATION

153
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:31,786
ABROAD AS WELL, WHICH IS WHY WE

154
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,454
ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO BE HAVING

155
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:33,755
THIS.

156
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:34,622
>> Tucker: A GOVERNMENT

157
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,257
OFFICIAL IN AUSTRALIA SAID

158
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:38,126
PUBLICLY MAYBE WE OUGHT TO ALLOW

159
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:42,463
ASYLUM TO PEOPLE BEING PEW

160
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:43,765
PERSECUTED FOR THEIR SKIN COLOR

161
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:44,866
AND HE WAS BASICALLY LAUGHED AT

162
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,267
AND THEN ATTACKED BY YOUR

163
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,068
GOVERNMENT FOR SAYING THAT.

164
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:50,471
>> HE WAS ATTACKED AND THEY SAID

165
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:55,009
THAT HE SHOULDN'T SAY THAT

166
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:55,877
BECAUSE THEY WERE PROVIDING HIM

167
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,879
WITH FALSE INFORMATION.

168
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,914
THE INFORMATION IS GOVERNMENT

169
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:01,082
STATISTICS.

170
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:01,816
WHOEVER SPEAKS OUT AGAINST THIS

171
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:04,152
JUST FOR BEING -- WE'VE BEEN

172
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:07,455
ACCUSED OF TREASON, PEOPLE

173
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
THREATENING US SAYING THEY WILL

174
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,659
WAIT FOR US AND ATTACK US.

175
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,360
THE PRESIDENT AND PARLIAMENT

176
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,495
CALLING ON US TO GO BACK TO

177
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:15,430
SOUTH AFRICA.

178
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,432
WHENEVER YOU SPEAK OUT AGAINST

179
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:19,367
THIS, THERE IS VERY SERIOUS

180
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:19,734
BACKLASH.

181
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,669
>> Tucker: THIS IS NOT WHAT

182
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:22,704
NELSON MANDELA WANTED.

183
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:23,438
>> IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE THAN

184
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:24,839
WHAT HE WANTED.

185
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,307
HE SPOKE ABOUT A FREE COUNTRY IN

186
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:29,244
WHICH PEOPLE WERE NOT JUDGED BY

187
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:29,878
THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.

188
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:32,180
HE EVEN WANTED FARM ATTACKS TO

189
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,650
BE A PRIORITY CLAIM.

190
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,051
WHEN HIS PRESIDENCY WAS OVER

191
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:37,919
THEY DEPRIORITIZED IT.

192
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,454
>> Tucker: SO YOU JUST WATCH

193
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,522
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN A

194
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,558
NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, ZIMBABWE,

195
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,860
WHICH WENT FROM BEING ONE OF THE

196
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,061
RICHEST ONE OF THE POOREST IN

197
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:48,563
THE WORLD BECAUSE OF ATTACKS AND

198
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,266
BECAUSE OF THE THEFT OF PRIVATE

199
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:51,633
PROPERTY.

200
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,068
IS THE ANC, THE RULING PARTY IN

201
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:55,637
SOUTH AFRICA AWARE OF THAT

202
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:55,970
LESSON?

203
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,806
>> THEY ARE, BUT REAL COMMUNISM

204
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:00,074
HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED, THAT'S

205
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:01,476
WHAT THEY KEEP SAYING.

206
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:03,011
IT FAILED IN ZIMBABWE, IT FAILED

207
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:04,512
IN CUBA, IT FAILED IN VENEZUELA,

208
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,514
HE FAILED IN RUSSIA, IT FAILED

209
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,883
IN CHINA, ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES

210
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:09,617
AND THEY ARE BASICALLY SAYING

211
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:13,855
ARE WE GOING TO TRY THE SAME

212
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:15,456
THING AND THIS TIME IT'S GOING

213
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:15,790
TO WORK.

214
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,524
>> Tucker: BASICALLY IT'S

215
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:18,159
IMMORAL TO TALK TO YOU AND HEAR

216
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,794
STORIES LIKE THIS FOR NO REASON

217
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,095
THAT NOBODY BOTHERS EVER REALLY

218
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:22,063
TO EXPLAIN BUT IT'S JUST

219
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:22,664
UNDERSTOOD.

220
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:24,465
IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO OUR MEDIA

221
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:25,466
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DISMISSING

222
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:26,834
YOUR CLAIMS AS FOLLOWS, WHAT

223
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,269
WOULD YOU SAY?

224
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:30,672
>> I THINK THERE ARE THREE

225
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:31,005
THINGS.

226
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:33,274
FIRSTLY, EVERYTHING WE SAY IS

227
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:33,675
FACT BASED.

228
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:34,409
IT'S BASED ON RESEARCH.

229
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,444
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HOPE TO

230
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,012
ACHIEVE AND WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO,

231
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:41,783
PEOPLE WHO WANT, WE WANT THEM TO

232
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:42,417
CALL ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN

233
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:46,888
GOVERNMENT TO SAY YOU WANT TO

234
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:48,656
EXPROPRIATE THOSE.

235
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:50,191
NUMBER TWO, WE ARE SPEAKING WITH

236
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,093
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ASKING

237
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:53,361
THEM TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE

238
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,095
SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH

239
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,463
COULD BE DONE IN A VARIETY OF

240
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:56,064
WAYS.

241
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,131
AND NUMBER THREE, MEMBERS OF THE

242
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,900
PUBLIC AND MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA,

243
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,667
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO TO

244
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,402
HELP US IS TO TALK ABOUT THIS,

245
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,204
TO TALK ABOUT IT ON PUBLIC

246
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:05,106
PLATFORMS AND IN THAT WAY TO

247
00:07:05,106 --> 00:00:00,000
CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE
