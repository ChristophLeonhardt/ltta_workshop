BRIAN: TOMMY LAREN JOINS US FROM
NEW YORK.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
BRIAN: KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID
THERE'S A LEFT -- VAST LEFT-WING
CONSPIRACY WORK.
>> OLIVER TO WATCHED THE
INTERVIEW LAST THEY COULDN'T
HELP BUT FEEL FOR THE GUY.
WHEN I WATCHED IT I THOUGHT
ABOUT MY DAD, MY BOYFRIEND, ALL
THE MALE FRIENDS I HAVE IN MY
LIFE AND HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO GO
THROUGH THIS.
YOU COULDN'T HELP BUT BE TOUCHED
BY THAT INTERVIEW.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
WHAT HAPPENS THURSDAY BUT IT IS
NOT ONLY A LEFT-WING CONSPIRACY
BUT JUST WRONG.
PETE: WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 36
YEARS AGO AND NO ONE HAS BEEN
ABLE TO CORROBORATE THE STORY
AND PEOPLE WHO SAY WHAT IF IT
WAS YOUR DAUGHTER THAT IS A
GREAT POINT BUT WHAT IF IT WAS
YOUR SON?
AND ALL OF US AND YOU WAKE UP
AND HAVE TO DEFEND YOURSELF
AGAINST CHARGES THAT YOU SAY
NEVER HAPPENED AND EVERYONE HAS
A STAKE IN THIS RESULTS.
>> LIKE I SAID ON TWITTER LAST
NIGHT, THOSE WHO ARE STILL VOCAL
ON THE LEFT ESPECIALLY THE MEN
THAT ARE SO VOCAL ON THE LEFT,
TO TALK ABOUT THE SURVIVOR AND
THE ALLEGATIONS I WOULD REMIND
THEM IT ONLY TAKES ONE PERSON TO
COME OUT AGAINST THEM FROM WAY
BACK IN THEIR PAST OR PRESENT,
THEIR CAREER, THEIR FAMILIES
COULD BE RUINED SO BEFORE THEY
ARE SO QUICK TO ATTACK HIM AND
BELIEVE HE IS GUILTY UNTIL
PROVEN INNOCENT THEY ARE TO
REMEMBER AND WATCH THEMSELVES.
>> WE HAD JUDGE ANDREW
NAPOLITANO ON THE SHOW AND HE
SAID THE BURDEN OF PROOF HAS
BEEN ON THEIR SIDE.
THE PERCEPTION IS REALITY ON
THURSDAY.
THE PERCEPTION DEPENDS ON WHO
YOU ARE FOLLOWING, WHAT CHANNEL
YOU ARE WATCHING, WHO YOU FOLLOW
ON SOCIAL MEDIA, HOLLYWOOD IS
PUTTING OUT THESE CAMPAIGNS.
>> HOLLYWOOD IS THE LAST PLACE
THEY SHOULD BE COMING OUT IN
DROVES CONSIDERING THEIR PAST.
I KNOW THEY ARE HOME TO THE ME
TOO MOVEMENT, I CALL IT THE WE
ALL KNEW MOVEMENT.
I HOLLYWOOD ACTORS, COMING OUT
SO VOCALLY, NOTHING TO CAMPAIGN
ON FOR THE MIDTERMS, THEY WANT
TO DISTRACT FROM ALL THEIR
FAILURES AND FOCUS ON THIS POOR
MAN WHO IS QUALIFIED, IT WAS A
GOOD MAN, A FAMILY MAN, TO
DISTRACT FROM EVERYTHING THEY
ARE NOT DOING.
BRIAN: MICHELLE OBAMA HAS A BOOK
COMING OUT WITH HER HUSBAND, JOE
BIDEN, TALKING ABOUT THE PAST
ADMINISTRATION, LISTEN TO HER
PLAN OF ACTION.
>> I AM SICK OF ALL THE CHAOS
AND THE NASTINESS OF OUR
POLITICS.
IT IS EXHAUSTING AND FRANKLY
DEPRESSING.
YOU CAN'T VOTE SOME OF THE TIME
AND THEN SIT OUT.
WE SAW THAT HAPPEN.
WE EXPERIENCED THAT.
WE HAD A GREAT PRESIDENT.
BRIAN: WE HAD A GREAT PRESIDENT.
>> BY WHAT MEASURE I WOULD ASK,
WAS HER HUSBAND A BETTER
PRESIDENT THAN THE CURRENT
PRESIDENT.
NOT THAT KIND OF GROWTH, NOT IN
POOR SECURITY, NOT INDEPENDENT
RELATIONS, NOT IN MAKING THE
UNITED STATES AND AMERICA FIRST
STRONG ON THE INTERNATIONAL
INTERNATIONAL STAGE ONCE AGAIN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE IS LOOKING
AT BUT BEYOND THAT THE DEMOCRATS
REALLY THINK THAT MICHELLE AND
BARACK ARE WHAT THEY NEED, THEY
DIDN'T DO IT IN 2016, COULDN'T
SHOW UP FOR HILLARY, COULDN'T
GET PEOPLE OUT IN THAT ELECTION
BUT NOW SOMEHOW WE ARE SUPPOSED
TO FOLLOW MICHELLE AND BARACK
OBAMA AND THAT WILL SAVE THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND I DON'T
THINK SO.
