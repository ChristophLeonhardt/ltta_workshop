REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF
STATE, FOR SOME REASON IS
REFUSING $60 MILLION THAT HAS
BEEN ALLOCATED TO HELP MITIGATE
THE PROPAGANDA BY RUSSIANS THAT
IS COMING HERE TO THE UNITED
STATES.
IT'S REALLY STRANGE.
LET
ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS ON WHAT
IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW --
>>-- I APOLOGIZE, IT'S ACTUALLY
$80 MILLION --
>>THE TERRORIST PROPAGANDA THEY
WANT TO FIGHT IS ACTUALLY ISIS
MESSAGING THAT IS SEEPING INTO
AMERICA RIGHT NOW.
THEY ARE
USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN ORDER TO
RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS, IT'S A BIG
PROBLEM, THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN FEAR
MONGERING ABOUT THAT FOR SOME
TIME, SO WHY IS IT THAT $80
MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO
HELP FIGHT THAT AND REX
TILLERSON HASN'T TAKEN THEM UP
ON THAT OFFER?
WELL --
>>THIS IS THE ORGANIZATION THAT
HAS THE MONEY, THEY KEEP TRYING
TO CONTACT TILLERSON AND URGE
HIM TO USE IT FOR WHAT IT'S
ALLOCATED 
FOR --
>>AGAIN, RUSSIA BEING ONE OF
THEM.
HE IS JUST LIKE, WHATEVER.
OH, YEAH, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
ISIS AND RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION,
I GUESS I WILL GET TO IT AT SOME
POINT.
>>AS USUAL THE PRESS IS GOING
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO PRESENT
DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES AS TO
WHY THIS MIGHT BE HAPPENING.
MAYBE HE IS JUST DISORGANIZED.
HE WAS BROUGHT IN BECAUSE HE'S
THE CEO OF A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY,
THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT IS TO BE
ABLE TO MANAGE WELL.
THIS IS NOT
LIKE OH GOLLY, I COULDN'T MANAGE
WELL, THE ONE THING I COULDN'T
APPROVE WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD
WORK AGAINST THE RUSSIANS, THE
ONES WHO GAVE ME A MEDAL, AND
THAT I HAD A $500 MILLION DEAL
WITH BEFORE I BECAME SECRETARY
OF STATE.
IF YOU ARE A
PROGRESSIVE OR A CONSERVATIVE
AND WORRIED ABOUT THE GLOBAL
ENGAGEMENT CENTER, AND THEY ARE
TRYING TO COUNTERACT THE
PROPAGANDA THAT ISIS AND RUSSIA
IS DOING, BUT YOU SAY WE
SHOULDN'T BE DOING PROPAGANDA
EITHER, WHAT IF THEY TURN IT
AGAINST THE U.S. -- THOSE ARE
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS.
BUT IF WE
ARE GOING TO COUNTER INFORMATION
FROM ANYONE IN THE WORLD I WOULD
IMAGINE IT WOULD BE ISIS, AND
GIVEN WHAT RUSSIA DID IN THESE
ELECTIONS, THEY CERTAINLY DID A
PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AND
MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN INSIDE
THE UNITED STATES, NO ONE
INCLUDING ALL OF THE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DISAGREE
WITH THAT, WHETHER YOU THINK
THAT'S ACTIONABLE AGAINST TRUMP
IS ANOTHER QUESTION BUT RUSSIA
DEFINITELY DID IT, THOSE WOULD
BE THE TOP TWO TARGETS OF
COUNTERATTACKS FOR
DISINFORMATION GOING ACROSS
THE WORLD, SO IF YOU DON'T
AUTHORIZE THAT YOU MUST
HAVE A DIFFERENT REASON.
>>THEY ARE NOT EVEN GOOD AT
HIDING WHAT THE REAL REASON IS.
LET'S HEAR FROM TILLERSON AIDE
R.C.
HAMMOND -- THIS IS NOT SOME
PROGRESSIVE OR LIBERAL WHO HATES
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, IT IS
TILLERSON'S AIDE -- HE SAID
ANY ATTEMPTS TO COUNTERACT
RUSSIAN MEDIA INFLUENCE WOULD
ANGER MOSCOW.
>>YOU CAN'T GET CLEARER THAN
THAT.
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO ANGER
MOSCOW.
THEY ONLY DID A MASSIVE
MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN DURING
OUR ELECTION, WE WOULDN'T WANT
TO ANGER THEM.
THERE WAS A STORY
THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK SAYING
TILLERSON MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE
SOON.
HE JUST GOT THERE, WHY
WOULD HE WANT TO LEAVE?
AND THE
GULLIBLE PRESS IS LIKE, HIS
AIDES AND PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM
ARE SAYING MAYBE HE'S FRUSTRATED
WITH TRUMP AND THE CHAOS IN THE
WHITE HOUSE -- NO, HIS WHOLE
POINT WAS TO GET THE SANCTIONS
LIFTED.
NOT ONLY WAS IT A $500
MILLION DEAL WITH RUSSIA THAT
EXXON MOBIL DID, THE REVENUE IS
UP TO POTENTIALLY $9 TRILLION.
500 MILLION IS JUST THE
INVESTMENT YOU NEED TO START THE
DEAL.
HE IS LIKE, I CAME HERE
FOR THE $9 TRILLION, IF I'M NOT
GETTING IT -- AND WHY DID THEY
PUT THAT STATEMENT OUT LAST
WEEK?
LAST WEEK IS WHEN THE
VOTES CAME IN WITH THE HOUSE AND
SENATE SAY WE AREN'T GOING TO
LIFT THE SANCTIONS UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES.
ALL OF A SUDDEN
TILLERSON IS LIKE, I FORGOT
ABOUT MY LUNCH APPOINTMENT --
MAYBE I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO
DO.
>>THIS IS A DISASTER, AND KEEP
IN MIND THAT THERE ARE STILL
MANY LEADERSHIP ROLES IN THE
STATE DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE GONE
UNFILLED BECAUSE OF THE
INCOMPETENCE AND THE FACT THAT
TILLERSON HAD NO INTEREST IN
THIS JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE.
HE
MIGHT WANT TO USE IT TO HIS
ADVANTAGE, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING
OUT FOR HIM BECAUSE CONGRESS IS
FINALLY STEPPING UP.
BUT IN THIS
CASE YOU HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS AT YOUR DISPOSAL, YOU
COULD FIGHT BACK AGAINST
PROPAGANDA.
YOU WANT TO LOOK OUT
FOR YOUR RUSSIAN BUDDIES, THAT'S
ONE THING.
WHICH I THINK IT'S
RIDICULOUS AND UNDEMOCRATIC.
BUT
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO COMBAT
ISIS RECRUITING WITHIN THIS
COUNTRY, WHY AREN'T YOU USING
THAT MONEY?
IT'S STRANGE.
FINALLY I WANT TO STATE THAT $60
MILLION THAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED
TOWARD THIS EFFORT IS SET
TO EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER 30,
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT WILL
HAPPEN AFTER THAT.
IT COULD GO TO THE STATE
DEPARTMENT BY THEM, OR THEY
COULD BE ABLE TO SAVE IT FOR
NEXT YEAR, I DON'T KNOW.
UNCLEAR.
>>IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO
USED IF THEY DON'T ASK IT BY
SEPTEMBER 30.
IF THEY DO, IT'S
NOT CLEAR IF THEY HAVE TO SPEND
IT BY THEN.
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE
IS TILLERSON APPEARS TO BE
RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK BECAUSE IF
THEY DON'T ASK FOR IT BY
SEPTEMBER 30 THEY ALMOST
CERTAINLY WON'T GET IT.
THEN HE
COULD TURN AROUND AND GO I GUESS
I MISMANAGED THAT, WE CAN'T
SPEND $60 MILLION CORRECTING THE
MISINFORMATION MY FRIENDS ARE
PUTTING OUT THERE ON RUSSIA,
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT TO
ANGER THEM, PLUS THEY GOT US
INTO OFFICE.
>>REPUBLICANS, REAL STRONG ON
NATIONAL SECURITY.
