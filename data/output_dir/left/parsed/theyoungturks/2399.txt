CHRISTIAN EVANGELIST PAT
ROBERTSON HAD A SOMEWHAT
SURPRISING TAKE ON THE GUN
CONTROL DEBATE WE ARE
HAVING, HE TENDS TO BE
PRETTY CONSERVATIVE AND
TRADITIONAL AND HAS KNEE-JERK
REACTIONS TO A LOT THAT'S
GOING ON BUT IN THIS CASE HE
MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.
>>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM A
GUN OWNER, I HAVE HUNTED, I HAVE
SHOT SKEET, I HAVE GOT AWARDS
WHEN I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS
FOR SHOOTING, I HAVE NO
OPPOSITION TO SHOOTING, BUT FOR
HEAVEN'S SAKE I DON'T THINK THE
GENERAL POPULATION NEEDS TO HAVE
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
IT JUST
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE --
>>AMEN.
>>IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE
RUSSIAN BUILT OR CHINESE BUILT
MACHINE GUNS.
IT JUST DOESN'T.
IT'S ONE THING TO DEFEND
YOURSELF WITH A PISTOL OR
SHOTGUN, TO HUNT WITH.
IT'S
SOMETHING ELSE -- AND I THINK WE
COULD BAN THOSE THINGS WITHOUT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE, THEY HAVE WHAT
THEY CALL THE BUMP STOCK THAT
WOULD GO AUTOMATIC -- WE CAN
STOP THAT.
AND THERE HAS TO BE
SOME MEDICAL BACKGROUND CHECK,
IF SOMEBODY IS SEEING A
PSYCHIATRIST, IS ON MEDICATION,
HE OR SHE NEEDS TO BE PROHIBITED
FROM BEING TURNED LOOSE TO THE
GENERAL POPULATION.
IT'S JUST
GOT TO BE.
IT'S SENSIBLE.
BUT AS
FAR AS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE
TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, THE
SECOND AMENDMENT, WE ARE
ALL FOR IT.
>>YOU KNOW THINGS OF GOTTEN
CRAZY WHEN WE AGREE WITH PAT
ROBERTSON, OR HE AGREES WITH US.
I THINK WE ARE GETTING THERE.
IF
WE BROKE THROUGH TO PAT
ROBERTSON, OR THE SHOOTINGS DID,
I THINK WE ARE NEAR THE MIDDLE
OF THE COUNTRY.
FOR THOSE OF YOU
UNFAMILIAR WITH AMERICA, BECAUSE
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE
COUNTRY WATCH US AS WELL, WE
HAVE THE REVERSE OF WHAT YOU
PROBABLY HAVE IN YOUR COUNTRY.
AND YOUR COUNTRY PROBABLY THE
RELIGIOUS LEADERS, THE NUNS,
PRIESTS, THE PREACHERS, ARE THE
FIRST TO CALL FOR NONVIOLENCE.
IN OUR COUNTRY THE PREACHERS ARE
THE LAST TO CALL FOR
NONVIOLENCE.
SO IS PAT
ROBERTSON, WHO HAS BEEN FOR WAR
AFTER WAR, AND DEVASTATION,
ETC., IF OUR RIGHT WING
PREACHERS ARE CALLING FOR
NONVIOLENCE, WOW.
THAT MEANS WE
HAVE REACHED NEAR THE BOTTOM OF
THE BARREL.
LIKE WE MIGHT
ACTUALLY BEGIN TO TURN AROUND.
AND ONE QUICK POINT ABOUT WHAT
HE SAID ABOUT LIMITING GUNS TO
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH
ISSUES, HIS STANDARD WAS ANYONE
GOING TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST.
THAT WILL NEVER PASS, NOR SHOULD
IT PASS.
>>THAT'S WAY TOO FAR.
>>BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE REAL
STANDARD IS IN AMERICA NOW QUEST
BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE BARRED
FROM BUYING A GUN IS IF A COURT
HAS ADJUDICATED YOU MENTALLY
INCOMPETENT AND AND CAPABLE OF
TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU
HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN A MENTAL
HOSPITAL AGAINST YOUR WILL.
AND
BY THE WAY, JUST SOME
ADJUDICATIONS OF MENTAL
INCOMPETENCE IS NOT ENOUGH.
FOR
EXAMPLE SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS
SOME PEOPLE ARE MENTALLY
INCOMPETENT AND CAN'T RECEIVE A
SINGLE DOLLAR ON THEIR OWN, THEY
MUST HAVE SOMEONE TAKE CARE OF
IT FOR THEM.
REPUBLICANS
OVERTURNED THAT LEGISLATION,
SAYING THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
BUY A GUN.
THEY CAN'T CONTROL
THEIR OWN MONEY BUT THEY ARE
ALLOWED TO BUY AN AR-15.
A COURT
HAS TO SAY YOU ARE SO MENTALLY
UNBALANCED AND UNHINGED THAT YOU
AREN'T ALLOWED TO BUY A GUN.
WHICH IS THE CRAZIEST STANDARD,
I'M SURE IT'S THE MOST STRIDENT
STANDARD ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
SO PAT ROBERTSON HAS NO IDEA HOW
FAR AWAY HIS STANDARD IS FROM
THE ACTUAL STANDARD IN AMERICA.
WE LET CRAZY PEOPLE BUY GUNS
HERE ALL THE TIME.
>>I NOTICED IN THE BEGINNING OF
THAT VIDEO HE EITHER DID OR HAD
TO DO THIS THING THAT YOU HAVE
TO DO IN AMERICA, IF YOU WANT TO
BE ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT GUNS,
LET ALONE GUN CONTROL, YOU HAVE
TO GIVE YOUR RESUME.
SO YOU
DON'T GENERALLY SHOOT A LOT OF
GUNS, SO I WILL NEED YOU TO ZIP
IT ON THE GUNS.
I WILL SAY I'VE
NEVER OWNED A GUN BUT MY FATHER
OWNED A BUNCH, I HAD MY GUN OF
HIS, I'VE BEEN TARGET SHOOTING
MANY TIMES, I'VE BEEN SKEET
SHOOTING LIKE PAT ROBERTSON, SO
I'M ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT GUNS
ACCORDING TO THE TWISTED LOGIC
WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND
NOBODY NEEDS THESE ASSAULT
WEAPONS, IT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT'S
NOT JUST THE HUGE CLIPS, OR THE
ACCURACY, IT'S THE INCREDIBLE
DESTRUCTIVE POWER THEY HAVE EVEN
COMPARED TO SHOTGUNS AND
HANDGUNS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
I
WANT TO GIVE A TINY BIT OF
CREDIT TO ANDERSON COOPER, WHO I
DON'T NORMALLY GIVE CREDIT TO,
BUT HE POINTED OUT ON HIS SHOW
YESTERDAY THAT WE SANITIZE A LOT
OF THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT
ONE THING WE SANITIZE MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE IS THE EFFECT OF
THESE GUNS.
PEOPLE THINK A
GUNSHOT IS A GUNSHOT, WHAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE?
A GUN IS A GUN.
IT'S
NOT LIKE YOU GOT SHOT AND YOU
HAVE A HOLE, THIS BLOWS BODY
PARTS OFF, IT DESTROYS TORSOS,
SHATTERS SKULLS.
AND I DON'T
KNOW HOW YOU GET THROUGH TO
PEOPLE, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE
DON'T WANT TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF
THIS, AND VERY FEW AMERICANS
SERVE IN THE MILITARY, BUT I
THINK IF PEOPLE SAW HOW UNIQUELY
DESTRUCTIVE THESE WEAPONS ARE
THEY WOULD NOT THINK THIS IS
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WEAPON.
IT'S
NOT A RHETORICAL TRICK TO CALL
IN A WEAPON OF WAR, IT LITERALLY
IS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD,
AND THANKFULLY PAT ROBERTSON IS
BEING INCLUDED 
IN THAT NOW.
