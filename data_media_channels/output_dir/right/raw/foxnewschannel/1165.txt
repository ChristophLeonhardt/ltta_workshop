1
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:13,958
>> Neil: WE ARE GETTING WORD,

2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:19,364
I KID YOU NOT, THAT NBA STAR

3
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:20,398
TURNED KIM JONG UN SOULMATE

4
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:23,168
DENNIS RODMAN WILL BE IN

5
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:24,736
SINGAPORE AHEAD OF THE

6
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:25,370
PRESIDENT SUMMIT WITH THE

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:25,937
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR.

8
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:28,206
IN FACT, HE MIGHT BE PART OF

9
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:31,242
THIS ONGOING PROCESS.

10
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:33,845
WHEN I THINK OF WHO COULD FIGURE

11
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:34,579
OUT WHAT THE HECK THIS MEANS, I

12
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,649
GO TO MY BUDDY, MY GOOD FRIEND

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,118
FOR SO MANY YEARS, CHARLES PAYNE

14
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:41,186
FOR SO MANY YEARS, CHARLES PAYN

15
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:41,619
CHARLES PAYNE.

16
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:44,022
WHAT THE HECK?

17
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:47,192
>> PETER NAVARRO IS OUT OR

18
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:49,527
WILBUR ROSS.

19
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:50,862
[LAUGHS]

20
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:54,666
NOW WE KNOW WE HAVE A DEAL.

21
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,668
SOUNDS LIKE A PUBLICITY STUNT.

22
00:00:56,668 --> 00:00:57,268
BETTER WAY TO GET MORE

23
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:59,070
INFORMATION ON THAT BUT IT

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,837
CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE IS

25
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:00,838
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

26
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:02,907
HE'S GOING TO GET A LOT OF

27
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:03,675
PUBLICITY.

28
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:05,510
MAYBE IF HE IS WEARING A PAIR OF

29
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,012
SKETCHERS.

30
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:09,881
>> Neil: ONE OF THE FEW

31
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:10,582
AMERICANS WHO HAS AN ONGOING

32
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:14,452
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN.

33
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:15,153
PRESIDENT PROBABLY CAN USE ALL

34
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,454
THE PRESS HE CAN GET.

35
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:19,190
THE PRESSURE IS ON, THE

36
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,059
TIMETABLE IS ON.

37
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:21,492
IT'S ONE DAY.

38
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:22,660
>> KIM JONG UN WENT TO SCHOOL IN

39
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,628
THE WEST.

40
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:24,295
HE OBVIOUSLY ADMIRED WESTERN

41
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:25,930
CULTURE INCLUDING BASKETBALL.

42
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,034
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE OLYMPICS

43
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:30,768
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE OLYMPIC

44
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:32,537
OLYMPICS, GOING AND WATCHING

45
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:34,672
WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAYBE, JUST

46
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:36,874
MAYBE HE DOES WANT SOMETHING FOR

47
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:37,642
HIS PEOPLE.

48
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,644
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION MUST

49
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:41,079
BELIEVE THAT ALL SOULS BECAUSE

50
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,381
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE THESE

51
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,882
OVERTURES ABOUT HARDWORKING

52
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:46,084
NORTH KOREANS, ABOUT THE

53
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:46,651
OPPORTUNITIES AND THE

54
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:48,086
INVESTMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO

55
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:49,887
POUR IN FROM CHINA, JAPAN,

56
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:50,288
SOUTH KOREA.

57
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:52,557
HE'S MADE HIS OVERTURE MANY

58
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:53,057
TIMES.

59
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:54,192
MAYBE SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE

60
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:56,227
BELIEVES ALSO IT'S ANOTHER

61
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,630
STRONG NEGOTIATING POINT.

62
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,831
>> Neil: WHAT YOU SAID IS DEEP

63
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:00,665
AND PROFOUND.

64
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,267
WHAT YOU ARE MISSING IS MAYBE HE

65
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,869
JUST WANTS SOME FAST FOOD OUT OF

66
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,871
IT.

67
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:07,505
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS.

68
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:11,075
>> YOU CAN GET DONALD'S, KFC,

69
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,311
YOU CAN GET IT ALL.

70
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:13,845
GET YOU A STARBUCKS.

71
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,847
WE CAN THROW IT ALL IN THERE.

72
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:16,214
BUT WAIT.

73
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,683
THERE'S MORE.

74
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:19,550
>> Neil: THE OWNER STILL

75
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,286
SEEMED TO BE HONEST TO PROVIDE A

76
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:22,487
LOT OF MONEY.

77
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,656
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY MADE

78
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,658
CLEAR, AND LOWERED EXPECTATIONS.

79
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:29,560
DON'T EXPECT US TO SORT OF BEADY

80
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,161
SUGAR DADDY DADDY HERE.

81
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:36,467
BUT I AM WONDERING WHAT WE WOULD

82
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:38,469
OFFER FOR THE KINGDOM TO START

83
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:38,936
DENUCLEARIZING.

84
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:40,505
>> I HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION OF

85
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:41,806
ALL THE EXPERTS AND NOT HAVE

86
00:02:41,806 --> 00:02:43,274
GIVE ME AN ANSWER.

87
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:45,677
THERE IS NO DOUBT THE NUKES ARE

88
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:46,878
NORTH KOREANS, THEIR CURRENTLY

89
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:47,679
THEY HAVE.

90
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,280
THEY MAKE A FEW BUCKS FAKING

91
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,181
BRONZE STATUES FOR OTHER

92
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:52,350
DICTATORS BUT BESIDES THAT, IT'S

93
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,184
THE ONLY CURRENCY THEY HAVE TO

94
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:54,385
GIVE THAT UP YOU NEED A

95
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:55,753
COMBINATION OF A GUARANTEED

96
00:02:55,753 --> 00:03:00,792
SAFETY AND MAJOR ECONOMIC

97
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:01,259
INCENTIVES.

98
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,461
IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG NUMBER.

99
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,862
I THINK THE WORLD WOULD SAY THE

100
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:05,596
NUMBER CAN'T BE TOO BIG IF YOU

101
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:11,469
GET RID OF THE DANGEROUS

102
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:13,838
WEAPONS.

103
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:15,840
>> Neil: OFFERING TO BUY UP

104
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,045
AGRICULTURAL GOODS FROM US, NOT

105
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:21,479
MUCH REACTION.

106
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,348
THAT WOULD BE QUITE A COUP FOR

107
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:24,749
THE PRESIDENT FOR IT TO PASS.

108
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:28,786
>> I THINK A LOT OF OTHER

109
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:29,487
PRESIDENTS WOULD'VE TAKEN IT,

110
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:31,923
RAN WITH THE BALL, AND DECLARE

111
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:32,657
VICTORY.

112
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:33,691
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PLAYING A

113
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:36,060
STRONG, TOUGH GAME.

114
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,862
I THINK IT'S A GOOD OVERTURE AND

115
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:39,597
I THINK HE THREW OUT SOME LARGER

116
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,666
NUMBERS BUT 70 BILLION IS HUGE.

117
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,467
MAYBE IT WILL WORK ON THE

118
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,869
TECHNOLOGY SIDE.

119
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,337
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HEAR

120
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:48,973
SOME SORT OF MEMBER OF

121
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:50,208
$100 BILLION TALKED ABOUT,

122
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,909
PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF LOWER

123
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:53,311
TARIFFS AND THE ABILITY TO OPEN

124
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:54,278
UP THEIR MARKETS.

125
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:54,979
YOU NEED SOMETHING ON THE

126
00:03:54,979 --> 00:00:00,000
TECHNOLOGY SIDE.
