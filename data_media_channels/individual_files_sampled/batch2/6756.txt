is Trump having buyer's remorse over Neil Gorsuch whom he appointed to the Supreme Court after the Congress delayed the process of confirming Merrick garland so Trump was able to essentially steal that seat now in a recent decision surrounding deportations of quote violent criminals Gorsuch actually sided with the liberal judges and Trump has a huge problem with that we'll talk about why specifically Gorsuch had a problem with the law and whether its liberal or conservative but according to the Washington Post Trump complained this week about Supreme Court justice Neil Neil M Gorsuch saying the judge had proved too liberal in recent cases according to administration officials who heard about the complaint associate said he was incensed that Gorsuch had voted against the administration on an immigration case and said it renewed his doubts that Gorsuch Gorsuch would be a reliable conservative one top trump advisor played down the comments as unhappiness which with gore such as decision rather than with gore such broadly what do you think only him only 45 could make a Supreme Court justice decision about him vote against unpredictability and arbitrary laws which he's the king of unpredictable in literature so I see why he's insulted by the yeah that's his calling card so sir and you're absolutely right because when I saw the headline I was like look I get a Gorsuch sides with a so-called liberals right and in this case so you know cuz service being mad Trump theoretically being against that that's all normal I'm not surprised by that but he's really animated in madacorp such I'm like over legal principles right that ain't the Trump I know I read into the story and it turns out it's his law to keep out immigrants and he that's why he's mad he's like he's not being loyal to me he's not being loyal okay you're fired oh I can't wait for him to try to fire Gorsuch everything is the apprentice I'm like dude it's an intellectual exercise you don't get it just stick to what you do tweet what do you mean suanne he's a very stable genius don't tell Trump about lifetime appointments because he'll try to get one as the question of whether Gorsuch is this like closet liberal the answer is no in the first session after his being inaugurated there were many many story you know confirm there are many stories about the decisions that Gorsuch had made in Davila versus Davis and California Public Employees Retirement System versus andsay Securities Gore Searchers vote was pivotal leading to final tally at five votes to four the first one of these Delta blow - death penalty opponents and the latter makes it more difficult to file certain class action claims he also filed his own dissent just all by himself on mud on Monday this is when it was reported by the LA Times when the court ruled for two lesbian couples and said that they had a right to have both their names on the child's birth certificate so don't don't worry Donald Trump he is still very conservative he's upset against his own interest like the whole thing is because laws need to be specific enough for the average person to understand it's like a super hyper technical issue but it's to help the average person so why isn't he on board for that cuz I'm sure reading it now he has no clue he's a very above average person is why yeah extremely above average so let me break down courses just a little bit so yeah he's very socially conservative so he's Pro death penalties against LGBT rights etc knees ruled that way as Brett explained and this case is it's just that basically a technicality it's important technicalities are important the the reason he sided with other justices because they didn't properly define the term violent crime he's like okay look I want to put away people and kick them out of the country for violent crime but you got to tell me what violent crime is otherwise we can kick him out for anything and so that's the lawyer in him goring you do kind of have to define terms that's how the legal profession works but if you want to know what Gorsuch is never gonna ban on its corporate issues so he was the most Pro corporate terney judge I was say in the whole country he was famous for being the one judge that looked at the famous case of the trucker who was gonna freeze to death and said if the corporation orders him to freeze to death he should and otherwise he can be fired every other judge that looked at that case said no if you're about to freeze to death you're allowed to go home and not get fired and gore says no no they could fine you can go home but they can't fire you for now freezing so and and if you look at his decisions all pro-corporate totally an utterly pro corporate that's how why he was picked and so this stuff about immigrants I'm sure he has a dislike of his left all other conservatives but that's not a driving force for him the corporate power is a driving force it seems like the one imperfection in the perfect machine which is Neil Gorsuch from Trump's perspective because the core search they say he's like a mini Scalia that was the reason why he was chosen one of the reasons why he was chosen to replace Scalia but he is that strict interpretation type guy the problem is for Trump to execute his plan when it comes to deporting immigrants is that's the one thing Trump seems to need is a super vague law so he can just show up and be like I don't know you seem violent get in my car right and if the more definition he has around that law the more limited the ice agents are when it comes to why they can deport someone and and Trump doesn't want that right it's like he's the vote is to prevent arbitrary prosecution not just walking up to anyone and being like you know what you got a crime you shoplifted you're out of here gotta be specific you shoplifted aggressively that's right by the way guys I realize as what you guys were talking about you know what corporations want undocumented immigrants in the country they're a very cheap labor force for them so this probably actually does go along with Gorsuch is pro-corporate stands baby to keep the immigrants in the country what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it and you get it completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm / join
