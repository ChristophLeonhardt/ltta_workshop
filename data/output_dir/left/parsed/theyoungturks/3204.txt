>>THE DAILY BEAST SPOKE TO
SEVERAL WOMEN IN ALABAMA WHO ARE
NOW CAMPAIGNING ON THE
DEMOCRATIC SIDE EVEN THOUGH THEY
HAVE HAD A LIFETIME OF VOTING
FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN
THEIR STATE.
THIS HAS BEEN A
REACTION TO SEXUAL ASSAULT AND
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS
TOWARD ROY MOORE, THE SENATE
CANDIDATE LOOKING TO FILL JEFF
SESSIONS'S SEAT.
AND REALLY
INTERESTING COMMENTS COMING FROM
SOME OF THESE WOMEN, ONE OF THEM
IS WALTON FOSTER --
>>HERE IS ONE OF HER QUOTES,
SHE SAYS --
>>A COUPLE WOMEN TALKING TO THE
DAILY BEAST DOESN'T SAY
ANYTHING, THOSE ARE ANECDOTES,
BUT WHAT ARE WE NOTICING IN THE
POLLS?
WELL, THERE WAS A FOX
NEWS POLL DONE, FOX NEWS IS BY
NO MEANS A LIBERAL ORGANIZATION,
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT
DOUG JONES IS ACTUALLY LEADING
--
>>HERE WAS THE MOST INTERESTING
OUTCOME OF THAT FOX NEWS POLL.
THEY DIVVIED UP THE FEMALE
VOTERS BASED ON AGE AND FOUND
THAT YOUNG VOTERS
DISPROPORTIONATELY FAVORED DOUG
JONES OVER ROY MOORE --
>>THE YOUNG, EVEN IN ALABAMA,
ARE ON OUR SIDE.
AND A LOT OF
THE OLDER MALES IN ALABAMA, AND
THEY LITERALLY KEEP SAYING, WE
HAVE COVERED A NUMBER OF
POLITICIANS IN ALABAMA, SAYING
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
EVEN IF HE
DIDN'T DO IT, SOME OF THOSE
GIRLS LOOKED REALLY PRETTY.
UGH.
WHICH 18-YEAR-OLD OR 25-YEAR-OLD
WOMAN, I DON'T CARE WHAT PARTY
YOU ARE IN OR WHERE YOU LIVE,
WILL SAY I THINK A 30-YEAR-OLD
MOLESTING A 14-YEAR-OLD IS FINE.
THEY WANT SAY THAT.
ON THE OTHER
HAND THEY HATE LIBERALS, THE
ALABAMA REPUBLICANS.
AND LET ME
BE CLEAR ON THIS, I GET THAT YOU
ARE IN A CONUNDRUM IF YOU ARE IN
THAT CATEGORY.
I ALWAYS DO THE
SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT.
WHAT I
WANT TO VOTE FOR TED CRUZ?
UNDER
NO CIRCUMSTANCES.
BUT IF HE'S
RUNNING AGAINST HARVEY
WEINSTEIN, AND WEINSTEIN IS A
PURPORTED LIBERAL, THERE'S NO
WAY IN THE WORLD I WILL VOTE FOR
HARVEY WEINSTEIN.
I WON'T GO
INTO A VOTING BOOTH AND MAKE
HARVEY WEINSTEIN A SENATOR.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES.
EVEN IF
HE'S RUNNING AGAINST THE MOST
LOATHSOME REPUBLICAN, TED CRUZ.
SO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ACTIVELY
GO INTO VOTE FOR ROY MOORE --
I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT WOMEN
UNDER 45, NO MATTER WHAT PARTY
THEY BELONG TO, CAN'T STOMACH
THAT.
THAT'S THE CORRECT ANSWER.
>>AND IT'S CRAZY HOW TRIBAL
THINGS HAVE BECOME.
TO THE POINT
WHERE IN TRUMP'S HEAD OR IN SOME
REPUBLICANS' MINDS, VOTING FOR
DEMOCRATS IS WORSE THAN VOTING
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED
BY NINE WOMEN OF MOLESTING THEM,
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING THEM, SOME
OF THEM WERE TEENAGERS AT THE
TIME.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME,
THAT YOUR POLITICAL IDENTITY IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED LIKE THIS.
>>ONE LAST THING, ESPECIALLY IN
A SITUATION WHERE PART OF YOUR
POLITICAL IDENTITY IS BASED ON
FAMILY VALUES --
>>COME ON.
>>WHEN YOUR POLITICAL IDENTITY
IS BASED ON FAMILY VALUES AND
THIS GUY HAS SHREDDED FAMILY
VALUES, FOR YOU TO TURN AROUND
AND GO, I STILL DON'T CARE -- AT
LEAST BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF
AND ADMIT THAT YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT FAMILY VALUES, YOU'VE JUST
BECOME PART OF A TEAM, A CULT
ALMOST, AND YOU WILL VOTE FOR
THAT PERSON UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES.
WE GET A LOT OF
HEAT BECAUSE WE WALKED BACK
DEMOCRATS UNILATERALLY UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES.
SOME DEMOCRATS
GET SERIOUS, WHY AREN'T YOU ON
OUR TEAM NO MATTER WHAT?
BECAUSE
I HAVE A BRAIN AND I'M ALLOWED
TO MAKE HUMAN JUDGMENTS ABOUT
WHETHER THIS PERSON ACTUALLY
REPRESENTS US OR NOT.
SO MAKE A
JUDGMENT IN ALABAMA, DOES ROY
MOORE REPRESENT YOU?
IF HE DOES,
THEN VOTE FOR HIM, I FEEL
TERRIBLE FOR YOU, BUT GO AHEAD.
BUT UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES
OF YOUR DECISION.
