1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,186
OTHER GEORGE W. BUSH AND FOX

2
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:04,721
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

3
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:06,256
KARL, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,624
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

5
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:09,459
THE PRIMARIES HAVE BEEN ROLLING

6
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:10,827
HERE, MANY STATES NOW.

7
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:12,195
WHAT'S THE BIG TAKE AWAY FROM

8
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,130
YOUR POINT OF VIEW?

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,432
>> WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

10
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,468
GENERIC BALLOT JUST BEFORE

11
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:19,402
CHRISTMAS, BEFORE THEY PASSED

12
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:20,904
THE TAX CUT, THE DEMOCRATIC

13
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:22,772
MARGIN WAS 13 POINTS, BY MID

14
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,741
FEBRUARY IT WAS DOWN TO 9, BY

15
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,876
LATE MARCH DOWN TO 7 AND AS YOU

16
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:30,113
SAY MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND WE FIND

17
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:30,847
OURSELVES WITH 4 POINT ADVANTAGE

18
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:31,781
FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

19
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:32,849
THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON

20
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:34,517
DURING THAT TIME, I THINK THREE

21
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,820
THINGS ARE AT PLAY HERE, ONE IS

22
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,921
IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRESIDENT'S

23
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,356
JOB APPROVAL, IT'S GONE FROM

24
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,291
BEING IN THE HIGH 30's TO THE

25
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,562
LOW 40's, THAT MAYBE 4-5 POINT

26
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:46,930
INCREASE MAY SOUND SMALL BUT

27
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,067
CRITICAL TO THE REPUBLICANS AND

28
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,203
42, 43, 44% RANGE.

29
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:55,038
SECOND OF ALL, THE ECONOMY,

30
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,406
PERCENTAGES OF THE ECONOMY ARE

31
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:57,440
IMPROVING WHETHER DIRECTLY FOR

32
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,743
TAX CUT OR NOT, WE CAN ARGUE ALL

33
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:03,913
DAY LONG BUT THE FACT OF THE

34
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:09,119
MATTER IS THE WAY PEOPLE --

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,020
PAUL: PEOPLE FEEL BETTER.

36
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,355
>> DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO

37
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:13,356
PRIMARIES AND ARE STARTING TO

38
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:14,557
SEE WHO THE DEMOCRATS ARE

39
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:15,892
PUTTING UP AND I'M NOT CERTAIN

40
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,227
THAT'S NECESSARILY HELPING THE

41
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:19,662
DEMOCRATS IN EACH AND EVERY

42
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,096
CASE.

43
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:21,831
PAUL: YOU SAY THAT I'VE SEEN THE

44
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,333
RACE IN NEBRASKA, TEXAS,

45
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,734
PENNSYLVANIA, THE LEFT SIDE OF

46
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:27,070
THE PARTY IS WINNING IN

47
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,172
DISTRICTS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE

48
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,241
DISTRICTS WHERE THAT KIND OF

49
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:34,544
MESSAGE MAY NOT PLAY AS WELL AS

50
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:35,578
CENTRIST VOICE, IS THAT YOUR

51
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:36,112
POINT?

52
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:37,080
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S TWO

53
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,514
THINGS.

54
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,416
ONE, THEY ARE NOMINATING SOME

55
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,418
LEFT-LEANING CANDIDATES LIKE IN

56
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:44,287
NEBRASKA AND PENNSYLVANIA, ONE,

57
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,488
BUT EVEN WHEN THE CANDIDATES

58
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:48,591
HAVE ENTERED THE RACE NOT AS

59
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:49,492
LEFT-WING CANDIDATE, THE

60
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:51,027
RHETORIC THAT THEY FEEL COMPEL

61
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,829
TODAY ADOPT IN DEMOCRATIC

62
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:53,897
PRIMARY PLACES THEM TO THE LEFT

63
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:54,998
OF WHERE THEY NEED TO BE,

64
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,533
REMEMBER, IN ORDER TO TWIN

65
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,600
HOUSE, THE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE

66
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,703
TO WIN DISTRICTS THAT ARE AT

67
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:01,838
INSTANCES RED.

68
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,740
PAUL: OKAY, HERE IS THE THING,

69
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,275
THOUGH, THE BUGGY NERRIC BALLOT,

70
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,676
THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S

71
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:07,710
TIGHTENING.

72
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,512
THE MARGIN FOR HOLDING THE HOUSE

73
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:11,381
ACCORDING TO KEVIN MCCARTHY, THE

74
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,850
MAJORITY LEADER IS 6, WITHIN 6

75
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,185
THE REPUBLICANS THINK THEY CAN

76
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:18,421
HOLD THE HOUSE BUT THIS DOESN'T

77
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,756
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION,

78
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:21,324
DEMOCRATIC VOTER ENTHUSIASM.

79
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:22,392
I'VE TALKED TO REPUBLICANS IN

80
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:28,231
SOME OF THE SPECIAL RACES, ED

81
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,134
GALLESPIE TOLD ME THE DEMOCRATIC

82
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,669
DIDN'T TURN OUT ENTIRELY IN THE

83
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:33,837
DATA ON ELECTION DAY BECAUSE

84
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:35,238
DEMOCRATS ARE SO FIRED UP THAT

85
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,773
THEY EXCEED THE POLLING, WHAT DO

86
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,274
YOU THINK OF THAT?

87
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,310
>> I THINK THAT'S ACCURATE BUT A

88
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,080
LONG TIME BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2017

89
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,616
VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE AND THE

90
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:47,650
NOVEMBER 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS

91
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,553
AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR

92
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:51,621
CONFLICTING INFORMATION.

93
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,623
WE'VE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF -- OF

94
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:56,226
MEDIA COMMENTARY THAT POINTED

95
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:58,361
TOWARDS BIG TURNOUT BY DEMOCRATS

96
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,729
IN TEXAS EVEN SUGGESTING THAT

97
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,966
THEY MIGHT ECLIPSE THE

98
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,634
REPUBLICANS, WELL, HALF MANY

99
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:07,036
PEOPLE VOTED IN REPUBLICAN

100
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:08,471
PRIMARY AND THE RUNOFF IS THE

101
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:12,275
LOWEST IN HISTORY AND OHIO

102
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,343
REPUBLICANS OUTVOTED THE

103
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:14,677
DEMOCRATS BOTH PARTIES HAD

104
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:15,812
COMPETITIVE PRIMARIES FOR

105
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,814
GOVERNOR, THE REPUBLICANS FAR

106
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:18,882
OUTVOTED THE DEMOCRATS.

107
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,351
SO, AGAIN, IT'S HARD TO SAY, I

108
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,086
WOULD SAY THAT ENTHUSIASM IS ON

109
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,821
THE SIDE OF THE DEMOCRATS BUT

110
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,322
WHETHER THAT'S SUFFICIENT

111
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:28,358
ENOUGH, WE DON'T KNOW, WE HAVE

112
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,426
AN ETERNITY TO GO BETWEEN NOW

113
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:32,562
AND NOVEMBER AND ALL KINDS OF

114
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,264
THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO EFFECT

115
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,165
VOTER ENTHUSIASM IN EACH PARTY'S

116
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:37,400
LIKELIHOOD OF TURNING OUT.

117
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,601
PAUL: SEEMS TO ME SOMETHING ELSE

118
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,036
THE HAPPENING AND THAT IS THAT

119
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:41,571
THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE FOCUSED

120
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:45,975
ON ROBERT MUELLER, ROBERT

121
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,244
MUELLER, DONALD TRUMP AND NOW

122
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:49,779
TALKING IMPEACHMENT ARE BEGIN TO

123
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:54,951
GO SHIFT, MAYBE IMPEACHMENT IS

124
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:59,589
RUNNING REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM.

125
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:00,690
DEMOCRATS ARE TURNING TO HEALTH

126
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,458
CARE, RISING COSTS, RISING

127
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,193
PREMIUMS AND GASOLINE PRICES

128
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:05,862
WHICH WE KNOW HAVE GONE UP FOR A

129
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:08,765
VARIETY OF REASONS AS THE SUMMER

130
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,501
DRIVING SEASON INCREASES.

131
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,970
ARE THOSE TWO REPUBLICAN

132
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,504
VULNERABILITIES?

133
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:14,938
>> THEY ARE.

134
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,873
YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON A REALLY

135
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:17,807
INTERESTING POINT WHICH IS THE

136
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:20,108
DEMOCRATS HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM

137
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:20,510
IMPEACHMENT.

138
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,111
I THINK IT'S FOR TWO REASONS,

139
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:24,514
ONE IT OBSCURES CHANCE TO TALK

140
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,748
ABOUT BROADER ISSUES AND SECOND

141
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,450
OF ALL, REMEMBER, IN ORDER TO

142
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,586
WIN THESE DISTRICTS, IN THESE

143
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,521
STATES, MANY INSTANCES THEY WILL

144
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,122
HAVE TO WIN SWING INDEPENDENT

145
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:34,791
VOTERS AND IT'S INTERESTING,

146
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,260
VETERANS ARE STRONG IN FAVOR OF

147
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,027
IMPEACHMENT, REPUBLICANS

148
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,829
STRONGLY OPPOSE TO IT AND

149
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:40,863
INDEPENDENTS TEND TO LOOK MORE

150
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:45,702
LIKE THE REPUBLICANS THAN THEY

151
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,203
DO DEMOCRATS.

152
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,472
PAUL: IF YOU WERE LAYING A

153
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:50,573
DEMOCRATIC HAT, YOU WOULD SAY

154
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:54,310
LAY OFF IMPEACHMENT?

155
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,778
>> OH, YEAH, THE VOICES HAVE

156
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:56,713
BEEN RIGHT ON.

157
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,714
WHETHER OR NOT EVERY CANDIDATE

158
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,982
IS GOING TO LISTEN TO HIM IS

159
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:01,718
ANOTHER THING AND DURING THE

160
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,187
PRIMARIES RHETORIC, EVEN IF THEY

161
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,189
HAVE NOT COME OUT AND ENDORSED

162
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:08,625
RESISTANCE BY CALLING

163
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,525
IMPEACHMENT, CANDIDATES WHO HAVE

164
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:13,363
BEEN MODERATE OR CENTRIST IN

165
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,298
VIEWS HAVE ADOPTED RHETORIC

166
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:18,401
WHICH MAKES THEM SOUND OFF

167
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:18,801
RESISTANCE.

168
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,769
FOR EXAMPLE, IN DALLAS,

169
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:23,306
DEMOCRATS TALKED ABOUT HOW TRUMP

170
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,008
WILL TAKE US INTO A WORLD THAT

171
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:29,679
WILL DESTROY THE WORLD AND IT'S

172
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,315
COMMON SENSE VERSUS QUOTE

173
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,716
IDIOCY, THE LANGUAGE EVEN IF

174
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:37,754
THEY DON'T ENDORSE, PART TO HAVE

175
00:05:37,754 --> 00:00:00,000
RESISTANCE.
