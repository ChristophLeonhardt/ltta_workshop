AS WE PREDICTED ON LAST WEEK'S
POWER PANEL, THE LARGEST ICEBERG
IN HUMAN HISTORY HAS NOW BROKEN
FREE FROM ANTARCTICA, TEARING
ITSELF OFF OF THE LARSEN SEA ICE
SHELF --
IT HAS BROKEN FREE AS IT HAS
BEEN EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD, AND
IS FLOATING OFF TO GOD KNOWS
WHERE.
THAT'S AN AMAZING
STATISTIC, THAT ICE SHELF LOST
SO MUCH ICE WHEN IT BROKE OFF
THAT IT HAS DROPPED DOWN TO
FIFTH LARGEST ICE SHELF IN
ANTARCTICA TO FOURTH.
NOW IT'S FLOATING OFF WHERE IT
MIGHT CAUSE PROBLEMS IN
SOUTH AMERICA, ON SHIPPING LANES
AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT
CERTAINLY IT'S A BAD SIGN FOR
THE DIRECTION OUR PLANET IS
MOVING, OR THAT WE ARE MOVING IT
IN.
IT'S SO LARGE THAT THEY ARE
CONSIDERING REDRAWING THE MAP OF
ANTARCTICA.
THAT'S AMAZING,
THAT'S HOW BIG OF A PIECE WILL
FLOAT INTO THE SEA.
IT'S ABOUT
TWO THIRDS OF THE SIZE OF
CYPRUS.
IF YOU SEEN CYPRUS ON A MAP,
IT'S UNDER TURKEY, IT'S BIG.
IT'S A BIG PORTION OF THE SIZE
OF HAWAII.
FOUR LONDONS.
ALMOST THE SIZE OF HAWAII OR
CYPRUS JUST FLOATING AROUND.
TRUMP WILL BUILD A HOTEL ON
IT.
IF HE HAS A CONNECTION TO THE
PRESIDENT OF ANTARCTICA, TRUST
ME, HE WILL TRY.
AND HE WILL SEND DON, JR.
THERE, AND HE WILL SAY HE DIDN'T
COLLUDE AT ALL.
THERE'S AN INTERESTING DEBATE
GOING ON THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
BEFORE THE SHOW, WE KNOW THAT
THIS PARTICULAR ICEBERG BREAKING
OFF IS NOT GOING TO IMMEDIATELY
RAISE OCEAN LEVELS OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT, IT WAS A PORTION OF
THE ANTARCTIC WHICH IS ALREADY
IN THE WATER, SO IT DOESN'T
CHANGE FOR IT TO HAVE BROKEN
OFF, BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS
ABOUT WHAT SORT OF SIGN THIS
GIVES US FOR CLIMATE CHANGE.
AND
THE SCIENTISTS SEEM TO DISAGREE
A LITTLE BIT IN THIS PARTICULAR
CASE.
A GLACIOLOGIST FROM THE
MIDAS TEAM, MARTIN O'LEARY, SAID
--
BECAUSE AS WE EXPLAINED ON
LAST WEEK'S SHOW, WHEN THIS
FRONT FACING SECTION OF THE ICE
SHELF BREAKS OFF IT MAKES IT
EASIER FOR THE ICE FURTHER UP ON
THE ICE SHELF TO GO BEHIND IT.
AND A LOT OF THAT ICE IS NOT
ALREADY IN THE OCEAN, IS
ACTUALLY ON LAND.
SO WHEN THAT
MOVES AND BREAKS OFF AND GOES
INTO THE OCEAN THAT WILL RAISE
OCEAN LEVELS GLOBALLY.
MARTIN
O'LEARY SAYS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY
SPECIFIC TO HUMAN -INDUCED
CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT NOT ALL
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT.
ONE
SCIENTIST, CHRISTOPHER SHUMAN,
WHO WORKS IN THE AREA 
SAID --
HISTORICALLY THIS IS JUST THE
LATEST SCARY SIGN --
IN THE PREVIOUS DECADE THERE
WAS ANOTHER LARGE SECTION THAT
BROKE OFF.
WE HAD RHODE ISLAND,
NOW WE HAVE DELAWARE, IS THE
NEXT ONE CONNECTICUT?
WILL BE
EVENTUALLY HAVE TEXAS?
WE MIGHT EVENTUALLY GET INTO
RED STATES.
DAMMIT, JOHN, I'M
NOT A SCIENTIST, TALKSHOW HOST.
SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO JUDGE
WHICH OF THESE SCIENTISTS ARE
RIGHT, AND I'M NOT IN THE
RIGHT-WING CAMP WHICH SAYS
SCIENTISTS, I DON'T BELIEVE
THEM.
IF A MAJORITY OF THEM SAY
IT'S NOT RELATED TO CLIMATE
CHANGE, AND IT'S NOT A MAJORITY,
THEY ARE SPLIT, THIS IS NOT AN
ISSUE WHERE YOU HAVE 97% OF THE
WORLD'S SCIENTISTS ON ONE SIDE,
THEN I WILL SAY I GUESS THEY
KNOW BETTER THAN I DO.
BUT AS A
MATTER OF LOGIC I'M ON THE SIDE
OF SCIENTISTS WHO SAY OF COURSE
IT'S RELATED.
THE REASON WHY IS,
WELL, IF YOU HAVE GLOBAL
WARMING, WHICH ALL THE
SCIENTISTS AGREE TO, 97% OF THE
WORLD'S SCIENTISTS, IT WILL MAKE
THAT ICE SHELF WARMER, MAKING IT
MORE LIKELY TO BREAK OFF.
THAT
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THE ONLY
FACTOR, OR EVEN THAT IT WOULDN'T
NECESSARILY HAPPEN OTHERWISE,
BUT COULD IT BE HAPPENING
QUICKER BECAUSE IT IS WARMER?
LOGIC SEEMS TO INDICATE ALMOST
CERTAINLY.
AND THEN WHEN YOU
LOOK AT JOHN WAS TELLING YOU,
LARSEN A ICE SHELF BROKE OFF IN
95, LARSEN B IN '02, AND THIS
ONE IN 2017, THAT'S A TON OF ICE
BREAKING OFF EASILY, ESPECIALLY
GIVEN THAT LARSEN B HAD BEEN IN
PLACE FOR 10,000 YEARS.
IT SEEMS
TO ME THAT THE WARMING LOGICALLY
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT,
AND OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE
SCIENTISTS COME OUT
ON THAT SIDE.
BUT IT'S A LITTLE LESS CLEAR
THAN MOST OF THE CLIMATE
CHANGE ISSUES.
I WOULD NOT CALL MYSELF AN
EXPERT YET, ALTHOUGH I'M WORKING
ON IT, I'VE STUDIED IT A LOT
BOTH IN ACADEMIA AND MORE
RECENTLY, I THINK THE STANCE OF
MOST SCIENTISTS IS LESS THAN IT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HUMAN
-INDUCED CLIMATE CHANGE AND MORE
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO
SPECIFICALLY POINT TO THE
CONNECTION.
THEY DO THE SAME
THING WITH NATURAL DISASTERS,
STORMS, INCREASING SIZE AND
INTENSITY OF HURRICANES, YOU
CAN'T SAY THAT THIS HURRICANE
WOULDN'T HAVE EXISTED IF NOT FOR
CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT YOU WILL SEE
MORE HURRICANES OF A PARTICULAR
SORT.
AND ALSO, BY THE WAY, THIS
IS THE THING ABOUT SCIENTISTS
THAT THE RIGHT-WING KNOWS
NOTHING ABOUT --
SCIENTISTS FOR THE MOST PART ARE
MORE HUMBLE THAN THEY SHOULD BE.
THEY ARE SLOW TO CLAIM A
CONNECTION UNTIL
PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES SHOW IT.
I DON'T THINK MANY WOULD SAY
THERE IS NO CONNECTION.
IF ALL THEY ARE SAYING IS YOU
CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE IF THIS
PARTICULAR HURRICANE IS
CONNECTED TO GLOBAL WARMING, OR
THIS PARTICULAR ICE SHELF
BREAKING OFF, THEN OF COURSE WE
AGREE WITH THAT, WE DON'T WANT
TO INHOFFE IT, I STILL HAVE A
SNOWBALL SO THERE MUST BE NO
CLIMATE CHANGE, THERE HURRICANES
SO THERE MUST BE CLIMATE CHANGE
-- OF COURSE NOT, THERE WERE
HURRICANES BEFORE, ICE SHELVES
HAVE BROKEN OFF BEFORE.
THE
QUESTION IS THE SEVERITY, THE
DEGREE, AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH
IT'S HAPPENING.
I THINK MOST
SCIENTISTS AGREE IT'S A
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, THEY ARE
JUST BEING OVERLY CAUTIOUS IN
OUR INTERPRETATION, THE BEST WE
CAN TELL, IN SAYING YOU CAN'T
TELL THAT IT'S THE PROXIMATE
CAUSE FOR THIS PARTICULAR ICE
SHELF.
