I've never seen that before yeah that's
definitely good Wow to monster
there's a big day this morning is
Francine's dancers visit ballet today
ballet dance recital very exciting stuff
show starts in about 10
the recital went really well especially
considering the last recital she just
stood there
she actually sheckly danced this time
we're very very proud parents this
morning so I have a bit of a problem
here with my my bike which is that I
travel with the charger to keep this
thing full but I ain't got nowhere to
put it
also I keep a lock with me and I know
we're gonna put that either so that's
also in the backpack those are two
problems I'm looking to rectify today
hey doing locks I'm looking for a lock I
want a lock that attaches to my bike in
a way that's like seamless I mean this
one does like a velcro strap
unlike the down tube only more secure
than velcro
sometimes it's
okay so I don't know how to attach it
yet but I think I got the right lock to
attempt to attach why are there palm
trees in New York City
must be some sort of some sort of party
happening in there
you hear out loud this is this is the
block
dear
funny story well not such a funny story
but true story right right when Candace
and I got married we got our dream
apartment which was which was this
awesome loft right across the street
from the studio in fact if you watch the
early episodes of the vlogs you'll see
me like skateboard and hoverboard
remember those things hoverboard from my
apartment to this office and the reason
why we moved is because 24 hours a day
seven days a week with some version of
that noise
it never ever stops
never underestimate the versatility of
zip ties so what I'm thinking here is
attach the charger right there under the
seat run the cable up leave it
permanently plugged in and then have the
DAC plug just sort of kind of hanging
loose and I'll wrap it around the frame
first zip tie already feels good and
secure all right now I'm gonna run this
cable huh into the charging port there
and then I need to tighten up this cable
which I will do with these
lighter-weight zip ties
last sanity to solve for here's what to
do with this cable maybe just wrap it
around here
it doesn't look pretty but that's not
the point okay now when I need to charge
my bike I can just plug it in and I no
longer have to carry the charger hey
that's a nice bird thank you
I like your tripod what's your bird's
name is dusty H projects an art gallery
when I was a younger man that art
gallery was like the hottest place in
Soho to hang out lock the bike up there
