AN OMINOUS WARNING IN THE EVENT THAT TALKS FAIL. Mike: JENNIFER GRIFFIN REPORTING FROM THE PENTAGON TONIGHT. THANK YOU. SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO ANNOUNCING THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY TOWARDS IRAN. ECONOMIC ISOLATION AND SANCTIONS. THE SECRETARY OUTLINING A SO-CALLED PRESSURE CAMPAIGN TO WEAKEN IRAN'S ECONOMY UNTIL IT CHANGES ITS BEHAVIOR. THE STING OF SANCTIONS WILL BE PAINFUL IF THE REGIME DOES NOT CHANGE ITS COURSE FROM THE UNACCEPTABLE AND UNPRODUCTIVE PATH THAT IT HAS CHOSEN TO ONE THAT REJOINS THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. THESE WILL AND INDEED END UP BEING THE STRONGEST SANCTIONS IN HISTORY WHEN WE ARE COMPLETE. Mike: POMPEO PROMISES THE U.S. WILL ALSO CONFRONT IRAN BEYOND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. HE SAID HE WILL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO TRACK DOWN IRANIAN OPERATIVES AROUND THE WORLD AND IN HIS WORDS, CRUSH THEM. IRAN IS DISMISSING THE THREATS TONIGHT. THE SOUTH KOREANS REPORTEDLY SINGLED OUT NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN BOLTON'S RECENT LIBYA MODEL COMMENTS FOR WHY PYONGYANG IS SUDDENLY HEDGING ON THE SUMMIT. THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO REPORTEDLY ASKING ADVISORS IF YOU SHOULD GO AHEAD WITH THE MEETING. HE WILL HEAR FROM SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON TOMORROW. JOINING ME NOW FOR ANALYSIS IS FORMER DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY FOR DEFENSE FOR INTELLIGENCE AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL, LIEUTENANT GENERAL JERRY BOURQUE ENDS. GREAT TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. Mike: A VERY FIRM SPEECH IN TERMS OF IRAN POLICY. YOUR REACTION TO HIS WORDS AND HIS ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THEIR? FIRST OF ALL, HE SPOKE TO THEM IN A LANGUAGE THEY UNDERSTAND, THE LANGUAGE OF STRENGTH. I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER DIPLOMATIC SPEECHES I'VE HEARD CERTAINLY IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. THAT SAID, I THINK HE GOT THEIR ATTENTION ON THIS AND I THINK YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE LINE HAS BEEN DRAWN IN THE SAND. NO MORE. HE'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE CAPTURING OUR BOATS OFF YOUR COAST. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE CALLING FOR THE DEATH OF ISRAEL. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU WANT TO DESTROY AMERICA AND I THINK THAT THEY GOT THE MESSAGE FROM THAT. Mike: NO SURPRISE THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT WAS NOT THRILLED WITH WHAT HE HEARD. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HIS COMMENTS. "COUNTRIES ARE INDEPENDENT. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR PATH WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR NATION. WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE FOR IRAN AND THE WORLD? WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? FIRST OF ALL, HE SAYS WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR NATION. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE PONDERING HERE BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY HAD THREE UPRISINGS INSIDE IRAN. ONE AND 2009, THE GREEN REVOLUTION, ONE OF 2,015 AND ONE IN 2017 THAT ROLLED OVER INTO 2018. ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN IRAN OUR PERSIANS. THE OTHER HALF ARE A MIXTURE. IT'S AN ECLECTIC GROUP THERE AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THEM THERE. AND BY THE WAY, THEY ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY PRO-WESTERN. HE'S GOT A PROBLEM. Mike: IS THERE HOPE OF A THOUGH THE EUROPEANS ARE TRYING TO HOLD ONTO THE OLD ONE? I THINK THAT THEY MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GO BACK AND TRY TO FIX WHAT WE HAVE. I THINK IT'S A START OVER, START FROM SCRATCH. THE KEY TO THAT IS NOT JUST IRAN, BUT IT'S THE EUROPEANS. UNDER THE EUROPEANS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO WHAT MAKES SENSE? ARE THEY GOING TO FOLLOW DONALD TRUMP'S LEAD AND ARE THEY GOING TO REALIZE THAT TRUMP WAS RIGHT, THAT TRUMP HAS TAKEN A BOLD STAND ON NOT ALLOWING IRAN TO GET THESE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY ARE A MENACE TO THE WHOLE WORLD, OR ARE THEY GOING TO STICK WITH THE EASY WAY, AND THAT IS TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEIR CORPORATIONS TO INVEST IN IRAN. Mike: TO NORTH KOREA, THE ODDS OF A SUMMIT SEEM TO BE PERHAPS SLIPPING A BIT. A SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER IS ALREADY PLAYING THE BLAME GAME. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. HE SAYING "THERE ARE SEVERAL LANDMINES ON THE WAY TO THE SUMMIT BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND THE U.S. ONE OF THOSE LANDMINES JUST EXPLODED, JOHN BOLTON." DID BOLTON MISSTEP? TO BEGIN WITH, HE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT. HE HAS BEEN ON THIS NETWORK MANY TIMES SAYING EXACTLY WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THIS OUGHT TO BE HANDLED. SO PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NOT SURPRISED BY WHAT BOLTON SAID THERE. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE BOLTON TOOK ONE FOR THE TEAM. THEY THREW THAT OUT TO SEE HOW IT WAS GOING TO RESONATE AND IT DIDN'T GO THE WAY THEY WANTED SO I THINK THAT TRUMP SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THAT BUT I THINK BOLTON JUST TOOK ONE FOR THE TEAM ON THIS. HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT THE SUMMIT ACTUALLY HAPPENS? IT'S A TOSS-UP RIGHT NOW. I'VE BEEN SKEPTICAL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING ABOUT WHETHER KIM AFTER ALL THE YEARS THAT HIS FATHER INVESTED IN THIS AND HE'S INVESTED IN THIS THAT WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO COME TO THE TABLE IN A SERIOUS WAY. I THINK NOW HE'S GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT HAVING TO NEGOTIATE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK IT'S 50/50 THAT IT'S GOING TO COME OFF AT ALL.
