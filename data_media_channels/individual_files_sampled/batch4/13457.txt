well at long last the nightmare is over the government has reopened we don't know how many days the government was shut down because without the government there was no way to keep track of time but the effects of the shutdown were felt everywhere from washington d.c all the way to well that was it really but the effects were devastating and could be seen throughout the Capitol for instance without reliable government sources reporters were forced to pretend they had reliable sources while they were actually spreading complete fabrications created wholesale out of their own prejudices so ok that was pretty much as usual but without government funding there was no one to defend the border from illegal immigration and that's pretty much as usual - but not everyone was so lucky for instance many federal workers were forced to stay home doing nothing instead of doing nothing at their offices as they usually do and in one empty lot off Pennsylvania Avenue cNN's Jim Acosta was seen screaming at the sky look at me look at me please look at me I'm Jim Acosta which raised the existential question if Jim Acosta is a rude useless lout but there's no one there to look at him does he actually exist and is he still Jim Acosta in other devastated parts of the city Democrats wept over the plight of tiny little 30 year old illegal immigrant children with sad eyes who roamed the city begging for bread by sticking guns in the backs of passers-by and saying give me bread however Republicans and Democrats have come up with a compromise that will reopen the government I tried to stop them but I got there too late trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right so the Democrats actually lost a government shutdown which almost never happens but we'll talk about why it happened this time and we'll talk about what the thing about the Democrats approach to immigration is that it's wrong in every possible way everything they're doing is essentially a scam we also speaking of scams we have Michael Knowles with us he spent you know there were these two women's marches I guess book home women's March as one was the pro-life March which is not necessarily women's March but it's an anti-abortion March and then the next day there were the women's marches which are protesting I have no idea what the fact that they're women I have no idea but they all spent this time at a class he's engaged to be married to sweet little ELISA and he spent this time at a class on how to be a Catholic husband how to have a Catholic marriage so we're gonna talk to him about he was actually doing something important all these women were screaming in the streets and we finished another Kingdom which I have to say was a major major achievement I mean not just getting it recorded getting it up there the sound guys Mathis Glover Mike Purnima in my prayers I read kameena Mike is that it Mike Kinnear it's Mike Mike Carmina Jonathan hey I I mean we paid them a pittance because we only had a pittance to pay them and they did such an amazing job the thing sounds absolutely fantastic if you haven't listened to another Kingdom you can now binge the whole thing all 13 episodes of the first season I have no idea how we're gonna get a second season up I really don't because we we cannot allow people to work that hard again in their spare time without paying them better than that we haven't got anything better than so one of the major emphases of this show is trying to get you people to stop acting like primitives and take care of yourself so you

except for listening in the show you can continue to listen to the show but otherwise be civilized and start to brush your teeth you know you know what the difference speaking of savages you know what the difference between people and apes and our brand of people and the kinds of people who like you know cro-magnon man who did died out it's absolutely true this is a obviously certain amount of conjecture on the part of scientists but what is it you know you say it's the brain we were talking last week a little bit about the brain and you know how it changed the way men and women interact with each because it means that women have to take care of babies more often all this stuff but but what is it about the brain that separates us from the Apes and you would say well it's language but the fact is a lot of Apes all animals have language and and sometimes they say whales may a very complicated language but they know that monkeys communicate and have different cries that mean different things the difference between the thing that makes humans different and and this is not romanticism this is actual just an actual thing that scientists believe in things that make humans different our ideas why because ideas bring more people together than animals can ever do if you see animal you can see an animal tribe say you see I don't know what to call him a tribe of Apes they can gather about a hundred and fifty of them to cooperate and they cooperate according to whether they're related blood relations and things like that right so and that was true of all kinds of other brands of what would you call them primates throughout the world they can cooperate it levels about a hundred and fifty each but human beings unite through ideas so I say I'm a Christian and you say you're a Christian and you're a Christian from some African country and I'm a Christian from you know New York and we can get together and believe in the same things we can pray together we can work together for the faith we have ideas that we share together and so we can cooperate millions billions of people can cooperate under the aegis of our ideas now here's the thing a lot of people don't think that ideas can describe the truth but nobody lives like that we know that there are good ideas and bad ideas they're ideas that describe the world and ideas that simply describe people's imaginations we know this because we know from math that we have ideas about numbers and those ideas can predict how light will shine from billions of miles away and of course if if a group of aliens came and wiped us out they would have ideas about math they might not not have the number two but they'd still be able to describe the world in the same in the same way so then in other words two plus two equals four maybe a strictly human way of expressing something but it expresses about the world that is a language that actually is true and we have ideas in America that define who we are as Americans and those ideas have not only worked well I believe that they're true those are ideas of equality of rights they're not a not equality of ability not equality of station not equality of outcome the Equality of the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness so saying that women and men have equal rights doesn't make women and men equal when it comes to throwing a ball or you know making a home they may have different capabilities according to their gender in general but they have the same rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness so it seems to me it is not asking too much when we let people into this country that we have a care that they share these ideas or are willing to share these ideas and are coming here for those ideas they're always talking about economics they always talk about the better life that you get here and you do have a better life and that's because our ideas are good ideas and ideas describe reality but the important thing is that they share and are capable of sharing these ideas so we should only let in people who are capable of agreeing with our dear ideas secondly we need to be willing to teach them our ideas boldly and confidently and say you know this is we don't we don't have to say every idea comes from Athens and Christian but they should know the history of freedom freedom has a history it doesn't drop it like the general rain from heaven it was built on certain ideas inch by inch people fought and died and thought and spent their lives building the ideas that give us the freedoms we have and we should be willing to teach that to people at every step of the way especially when they come from foreign lands and finally we should have the the boldness and confidence to enforce the laws and force the laws that are passed in accordance with our ideas because our Constitution is a legal representation of our ideas brought into governmental life and we should be able to say when we pass a law it gets enforced if we don't want to enforce it we get rid of the law we change the law whatever we do and let me ask you something at what point so we have three things letting people who will agree with us teach them about America and what it stands for and enforced the laws that are created through the American system which one of those two Democrats agree with the Liberals agree with make it broader to the left disagree with none okay they're willing to just open the borders so they're not obeying the law suddenly the law disappears because they feel like oh you know we feel we feel so much we're so tender-hearted we have so much compassion that we're going to open the borders they don't want to do that they don't you know in leftist schools do they teach that America is a good thing that our ideas should supersede the ideas of other people that our ideas are better than the ideas that created Kenya or the ideas that created China or Russia do they talk about that I don't think so I don't think I mean it's some schools they do but there are a lot of schools where they're teaching you that this is you are oppressed that these laws are bad things so all right at any point at any point are they willing to defend the ideas that make America such a draw to people from around the world and have done you know we talked about Donald Trump we talked about the fact that we should be careful who we let in from Muslim countries especially Muslim countries that are dysfunctional Chuck Schumer reacted to this hilariously by bursting into tears do we have a think we have this cut about yeah this is cut twelve now here's the reaction so in other words Donald Trump no great intellectual genius but simply said you know we should let in people who love this country here's here's Chuck Schumer's reaction for that this executive order was mean-spirited on America who was implemented in a way that created chaos and confusion across the country and it will only serve to embolden and inspire those around the globe who will do us harm it might be reversed immediately Senate Democrats are going to introduce legislation to overturn this and move it as quickly as we can and I as your senator from New York will floor strap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are over and so he's surrounded by Muslim Americans and it's all about the emotion it is always about the emotion but if you start to think about it first of all they first of all they will play your emotion any way they want so if the people come up and they say you know what we we really shouldn't force the law I mean it's the law right because the question is not who comes into the country first that's not the first question it's who decides who comes into the country and obviously it should be us it should be Americans who decide who comes into our country not whoever wants to come in oh I want to come in so I get to come in or I'm in trouble so I get to come in there are all kinds of ways to solve the problems with people in trouble without letting them into the country all kinds of ways to do that but when the people the public says you know we don't want to let more people into the country suddenly Chuck Schumer becomes a tough guy then once people are here it's suddenly the emotional thing again here's Chuck Schumer debating with Chuck Schumer on this issue and I mean this is just a brief brief thing I could do this forever I could do the entire show of Chuck Schumer two-faced Chuck Schumer but here he is talking at one point when he knows the public wants stronger borders and at another point when he's trying to keep the dreamers and people who've come in illegally he's trying to keep them here who enter the United States without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the US legally president's decision to end daca was heartless and it was brainless when we use phrases like undocumented workers we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combating illegal immigration hundreds hundreds of thousands of families will be ripped apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not gonna say I think it is illegal and wrong tens of thousands of American businesses lose hard-working employees a biometric based employer verification system with tough enforcement and auditing is necessary to significantly diminish the job magnet that attracts illegal aliens to the United States they may have known no other country but ours and it voluntarily registered themselves and so the ratchet always only turns one way okay the ratchet you know what a ratchet is this I like you've seen ratchet wrenches that's where it turns in one direction and then it just crackles when it goes back the other way clock and then it push it again it only turns one way the immigration ratchet for the Democrats only turns one way they talk tough but they don't do anything they never implement these things it's always the same thing and they're doing it now with daca they're saying well give us give us the dreamers amnesty for the dreamers now and we'll give you border security later but when it comes time for border security it comes remember daca with a stands for is delayed action delay that's what the DEA stands for delayed action but it becomes permanent cuz once they're here Chuck starts crying Chuck's eyes fill up oh this is the only country they've ever known and the problem with emotion always is that it's always targeted it's always targeted to God if you don't have a philosophy if you don't know what you think if you don't know why you think what you think let me ask you this question here's a perfect way of looking at what what do they say they say there's 11 million illegals here but it's probably a lot more than that but let's say for a minute it's 11 million people what if 11 million Americans tomorrow tomorrow 11 million Americans from say Texas let's say they're white let's just make it clear this is these are white Americans what if 11 million Americans just moved into Mexico tomorrow armed and said now this piece of Mexico we live here in this piece of Mexico and then when they tried to throw them out and say here's our children look our children are so small our children country they've ever known as Mexico they've been here three days already and they they just think this is home for them you know suddenly crying of course of course the same people on the Left would say this is an invasion this is colonialism this is not right you know so they're always crying for these people they're crying for the Muslim who can't come in they're crying for the Mexican who can't come in but they're not crying for the people who are saying whoa wait a minute wait a minute this is our country our country is very successful our country is done very well it has done well by letting in immigrants but by letting them in Legally by checking through them by limiting the number of immigrants the number of immigrants goes up and down there was a big push to have them come in and turn in the century then people start to say no you know push back let's stop let's digest these people and make them Americans that's what I think is happening now and I think is the people have a very very good sense of what's happening so they shut down the government over this hoping because they always know that the press the press is going to side with the Democrats the press is going to say oh the Democrat you know remember in 2013 it was a Ted Cruz shut down the government to try and get rid of Obamacare and all it was terrible oh my gosh I would they were gonna lose the midterms everything was gonna go wrong everything was terrible and Obama if you will remember this they wrote about this in the Wall Street Journal today but I remembered it quite well the Obama administration went out of its way to make sure they knowing that the media would blame the Republicans they went out of their way to make sure that it would hurt Republican it would hurt the public that the government was closed so for instance they they lock down parks and public lands and here I'm reading from The Wall Street Journal on the eve of the 2013 shutdown Park Service spokeswoman Jennifer momart emailed colleagues about a scheduled world war two memorial visit by aging or terminally ill veterans these were guys who fought in World War two now getting to the end of their lives right and they wanted to visit a World War Two memorial and the Park Service spokeswoman asked whether we are physically preventing people through use of some barrier to gaining access Deputy Superintendent of Operations Karen Carillo replied yes signs and barricades the 2013 shutdown caused by Ted Cruz right to stop Obamacare the neck State Park Service spokeswoman Carol Johnson was at the memorial and ready to make a political point as the 91 veterans arrived and were turned away this is so meaningful to the vets she told the press the main thing is we'd like to get back to work and welcome visitors again the VIP veterans were able to visit the memorial only after Mississippi Sippy congressman Steven Palazzo and others moved the barrier to find signs announcing the site's closure in contrast to this show the Trump administration went out of their way to make sure funds could be spent to keep as many parks open and as many services going as possible they did not play the public they did not harm the public to make their point and it started to look bad this is why the Democrats caved and they have caved they've essentially said yeah we'll fund the government but we want a debate on immigration so they got nothing they got nothing they actually lost this fight and even when they came out and tried to make arguments even CNN they're their spokesperson they're sue CNN their outlet was challenging them on their arguments listen to this let's take the facts wolf the Republicans are in control of both houses of Congress and the White House they're injured well let me interrupt politely some they're not completely in control of the US Senate as you know they only have 51 votes the Democrats are in the minority but you need 60 votes in order you need 60 votes in order to be to break a filibuster so they're not in control of the Senate when it comes to this issue that's absolutely right states of america they're asking us to pass the fourth continuing resolution which is a temporary measure very costly to the agencies doesn't leave us strong in terms of national defense they refuse to face some of the critical issues they haven't reauthorized the children's health insurance program they haven't reauthorized the community health care clinics they've refused that's in the bill that was up locally yes the chip program is included in it but frankly 40% of the services provided these children come from community health clinics which they refuse to authorize and fund so what you said about Democrats not having control so true the white house the house but in the Senate where there is a filibuster-proof majority that is needed to pass democrats do have albeit limited but they do have power so that's what was happening on CNN the communist news network and meanwhile Trump came out and Trump is or is tweeting the whole thing and he's tweeting this is the Democrats fault and so he's reaching people he's getting the news out and meanwhile he came out with this two-fisted ad this is cut number nine this is a an ad about a illegal immigrant who killed some police officers was put on trial and he said his only regret was that he didn't kill more of them and Trump turned that into an ad and it is that's illegal immigrant Louis bracamontes charged with murdering two police officers it's pure e President Trump is right build the wall deport criminals stop illegal immigration now Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants president Truong will fix our border and keep our families safe I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message you know the funny thing about Donald Trump is that I'm not son I don't want to elevate him beyond what he is I mean he's a pot you know you can say he's not a politician but he's acting as a politician he knows his people he knows his base he speaks to them sometimes I don't even know what he believes but he has caught on to something that is simply true when he went after the NFL for not saluting the flag when he said let us say Merry Christmas he that may be cheap shots but they're cheap shots is something that is essentially true which is that we are bound together by ideas and these ideas express themselves and the little things we do every day like pledging allegiance to the flag like saying merry Christmas to one another a acknowledgement that our tradition comes through a certain path that our ideas are based on other ideas that we got here by a certain way and Donald Trump has caught on to that and has done it and has fearless lead offended that against cries of racism from the left which is the only thing they can ever say because all they can see is race all they can see is the color of people's skin and the funny thing is it has nothing to do with that has to do with the ideas but he has also withstood the storm from the right saying that he's a demagogue saying that he's using these terrible issues the intellectuals the intellectuals who do understand less than any other person people alive the intellectual saying who cares about that you know why are you making a big fuss about the NFL why are we but you know we can say Merry Christmas nobody but the fact is the fact is the left has succeeded in making it seem wrong to criticize any protester who happens to be black as the guys are that yet in the NFL who are disrespecting the flag and and in making it seen that you're doing something wrong by simply celebrating the traditions that got us here but the traditions of gamma-sphere are on offer to anyone we do not say you cannot have a part of this tradition if your skin is the wrong color or you come from the wrong country but we do say we do say you have to ascribe you have to subscribe to the idea of America to get here and in what way in what way does the Left support that idea I would say in none I would say everything they do is to attack that idea including letting in illegals against it letting illegals in a way that is illegal letting them in against the law I you know I have no real opinion on who should come here when I think there are people who know better than I then I what kind of people we need and where they should come from and what they should do but certainly certainly we should decide and we should decide it according to our ideas all right I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube so bet you can come on over to the Daily wire calm and hear the great and powerful Michael Knowles as he talks about Catholic marriage which he's going to do and while you're there don't be a fool man subscribe subscribe for lousy ten bucks a month miles a hundred bucks for the entire year and you get the leftist tears mug you can be in the mail bag you can participate in the conversation and you can watch the whole show right there on the site it's a good deal come on over so Amanda presto I always call her Amanda pressto because her name is Amanda Presta Giacomo trusted Giacomo so you have to write it down to know it but Amanda Preston I think that's her her I think her name on Twitter isn't it is Amanda press so she's one of my favorite writers of the daily wire a nice lady but also just a really good writer really a good observer of things and she was at the pro-life March and she wrote this piece that was so true it says she says the pro-life movement and the feminist movement could not be more different and this sharp contrast was on full display over the weekend for the very first time I had the opportunity to attend the March for Life in Washington DC the crowds were massive it's the largest annual human rights march in the world and the people were cheerful warm and full of joy the theme of the event was fittingly love saves lives families proudly pushed their babies with Down syndrome and an abnormality we as a society are urgently told to dispose of in their strollers with smiles on their faces former abortion clinic workers held signs proclaiming that life matters teens chanted about their love for babies and held clever and playful signs single mothers boasted of the children they chose to keep thanks to chose to keep thanks to pro-life pregnancy centers and religious organizations of congresswoman told the masses of the miracle birth of her daughter who was supposed to die upon delivery and the faithful said prayers aloud in unison sank Church rooms you can see actually we have a little cut of it let's show the March for Life is marching along saying the Lord's Prayer as they go today compare that and I didn't I couldn't bring anything in to show because it's all so foul the women's marches were relentlessly obscene the language the signs were relentlessly anatomical and obscene they were all filled with cursing out the opposition cursing Donald Trump all filled obviously they're wearing those hats that let you know that they have put their vaginas where their brains are supposed to be that's that's what I mean that's the meaning of that hat as far as I can tell and just the rage and these people have I'm sorry but they have nothing up individually they may have stuff to be angry about but I do seriously believe that the difference is God and the spirit living in spiritual life versus living a life that puts your vagina on your head you know I think that those are the differences and to speak about that we have the star of another Kingdom the heartthrob a man has become a heartthrob internationally around the world for his reading his performance up another Kingdom Michael Knowles who spent the weekend in a much much different way how you doing I'm doing great I can't believe it it's sort of a sad moment right now because the last acting job that I'll ever have it's true it's true and you were you were great and everybody said I mean they're now 1805 star ratings on the thing it gets incredible reviews and some of them actually mentioned that it was the only good thing you've ever done yes it is actually really nice as an actor because I have done like a million little projects on TV and indie films and stuff that nobody's ever going to see because we have no creative control over it right a lot of these projects go through the Hollywood system so they're always this crazy leftism these patina this patina of leftism that goes over it and it just I don't know it doesn't make the projects as enjoyable this one we said two words to Hollywood which were not happy birthday and we did it ourselves and you write wrote it and nobody was able to tell you take this out that's not politically correct no no you can't do this we put it out there and then it got a ton of attention and as you said a lot of five-star reviews and I love it and I don't care if Hollywood doesn't want to take on conservatives and doesn't want a green light conservative projects even if they're popular cuz we can just keep doing it ourselves I know I mean I start today thinking about how we can bring us afford to bring a second season because the sound guys Malthus and his team were so great yeah they worked for so little and they worked so hard that I I don't know how we can't ask them to do that again because first of all they'll beat me up right but but we will figure it out and we'll try and bring a second season come the fall so talk about this you you're getting married to this little ELISA ELISA is a sweetie I can't know what you always change it is a sweet little ELISA or sweet little ELISA well you know as I learned from Genesis 3 that's my Dominion I can change her name it will is my family you know I know her name is ELISA I exclusively refer to her as sweet little ELISA I see and you know so I okay so all very often I'll explain you know wake up in the morning and just say Mack you should do your show and she'll say you know I don't sound like that look this is my family I'm gonna go I want darn it and yes we went to Aaron's class this weekend and you went to marriage class now sweet little ELISA is in fact Jewish Jewish Jewish that's the whole thing yeah but but you are you having a Catholic marriage and you have to take a class to do this is that right that's exactly right so you go the Catholic Church is pretty open about this as long as you're gonna raise the kids Catholic you know you don't need to be baptized or anything for a wedding if you get baptized you're supposed to do it for the Jesus as a matter of fact so they're very open but there are few requirements that you have to do before you get married in a Catholic Church one of them is take a class called pre-cana and I was sort of dreading it I felt it would be probably cornball and they would just tell you to never use condoms that have a million children and the Catholics are want to do but it was wonderful it was a great experience the people who ran the show themselves had a had been married and had a ton of marital problems and they went to one of these the the Catholic version for already married couples and it totally transformed their marriage and I think everybody regardless of their faith Wow could benefit from this so these are the people teaching it at had problems in their marriage a lot of problems they were brink of divorce Wow and they weren't really going to church I don't I think the wife herself wasn't Catholic and that's why I really this this could be quite an ecumenical experience and because everything is taught here is so common sense it's not like it comes out of some deep you know you need to have a PhD in Christ ology in order to understand it yeah but it seems like common sense but these days with the women's marches and the and the pink hats and the screaming common sense isn't very common so I do think I learned much more about equality of the sexes and the relationship between the sexes a Catholic marriage class than I ever could have it at the Women's March and a lot of the Catholic marriage class is just scraping away the insidious ideology of feminism and it really makes you especially when you look at the women's March you see feminism is this totally perverse and self-defeating ideology that you know they say people like Aziz Ansari say feminism just means you think men and women are equal you think well that's a funny name to pick that isn't it strange name there is an ideology for that it's called egalitarianism right but what feminism does is it if it forces women as you frequently say to take on all of these male sensibilities these masculine views of the world that they could never live up to so one great example particularly pertaining to marriage is the hookup culture the hook-up culture says and because feminism says this that men and women view sex exactly the same way we're just all going out there to have fun casual sex is great men and women both love it and this is really awful on two counts because it convinces women that they should want casual sex and if they are unfulfilled by that there's something wrong with them and it convinces men that women want casual sex and so you can treat them as disposable young what does that leave you leaves you women who are who delude themselves on the one hand and our utter ly used by men who do have a rapacious appetite for sex in a way that women do not and in the Catholic Church to their credit has been arguing this for many many years even and with birth control they say it contributes to this and they dicted it was going to happen in their predictions Game four was that's what that's exactly right and so there were some takeaways from this I thought they would talk about what's called natural family planning huh which is yeah really referred to as pull and pray and it's a little more sophisticated than that it has something like a 98 to 99 percent working rate as long as you do it correctly yeah and but it wasn't really that the one thing they did say is that when you enter into marriage for it to be sacramental you can't close yourself up to the possibility of children you can say maybe I don't want children right now maybe I'd prefer to not have a dozen children but to close yourself off entirely stops that marriage from being a marriage it it invalidates it and they drew they drew this interesting dichotomy between civil marriage which is a contract it's what most people engage in and sacramental marriage which is a vow before God and one big difference here is that civil marriage you don't need to be open to children you can said I want have any children you can dissolve it whenever you want because it's a contract and either party is perfectly free to dissolve it sacramental marriage is not that way because you make a fool of God you make a promise to God you will love and cherish this person until the end of time and an image that they drew which I feared would be corny but I think is quite illuminating is that of an equilateral triangle with God at the top and the husband on one side and the wife on the other and their idea is that if your marriage is centered around something real and permanent and eternal and outside of time and space such as say the creator of time and space then as if the husband gets closer to God he will become closer to his wife and vice versa if the husband gets closer to his wife or vice versa they will get closer to God because there's triangles always equal a triangle it's always equilateral and to hear the testimony of even just a couple who ran it that seems so clear and when one thinks about difficult marriages or failed marriages that you've seen on your own there is always there does seem to be that lack of grounding it in something outside of the two of you you wrote about it beautifully in the great good thing about there there was you and there's your wife and then there's this thing that's separate from you and your wife it's not only separate but but somehow better you know it's it's a very strange thing I mean you know I I always I mean you you know Ellen my wife is she is a spectacular human being and she's one of the nicest human beings I've ever I've ever met knowing you one would and just know this intuitively but she is an angel she is but but we're all flawed people and I'm flawed and she's flawed and yet the marriage seems to be something that actually has the capability of healing us in in within itself of making us better within itself and certainly certainly my experience of the possibility of actual love in the world was part of what led me to God was part of what led me to believe well well I would start to think of my some home look if I recognize love when I saw it and I was right and I see God maybe I'm not crazy maybe they just say to me I'm having an illusion I'm having a delusion doesn't make any sense because I've been crazy I know that's what I've been saying and when you start to say that when you start to realize that the internal experience of love can be real and lasting then you start to realize that you are capable of perceiving things that are not visible to the naked eye that that's right and and that that the realness of that the tangibility of that seeing it's ovis of feeling it so viscerally I think that this gets to the difference between sacramental marriage and whatever passes for marriage today I think gets to the essential criticism of the left which is that the left wants the appearance of the thing without the essence of the thing so they want a university degree but they don't want a liberal education they eat vegan bacon you know they whatever they drink decaffeinated coffee and they want what looks like a marriage on this on the outside without the thing that makes the marriage itself and you observe this all especially now planning out the wedding everything is so so expensive and over time weddings seem to have become much more elaborate and much more expensive I've been to a number that have been absurdly extravagant and I wonder if the reason that the wedding ceremony itself is so extreme is because the seriousness with which we view the marriage has become less important I think that it's absolutely true my sister Caitlyn Flanagan wrote about that at the Atlantic many many years ago that it you know it's it when you start to propose and you have to have a plane going overhead and you're in a stadium and it's on the jumbotron and all this stuff you start to think like well maybe this it out of meaning you know maybe maybe all I have to do is ask you know maybe that's not what it's about maybe it's not about the ceremony itself in these marriages these weddings that cost the bankrupt people they send you into debt obviously you won't have a nice party it's a big day and it means a lot especially to the bride I think but still but still you know it gets so outlandish that you start to think there's an emptiness at the heart of it no question about I'm interested to hear that that part of the sacrament is the willingness to have children I did not know that obviously I know that the churches were the things that they said we thought like no I can't go there not at all there there really wasn't at all I thought the whole thing would be some person hectoring us about how we need to start having children immediately and keep popping them out it wasn't that but that focus on the openness to children is about saying yes to life it's about saying yes I accept you I don't merely want my own gratification be it sexually or professionally or personally or whatever emotionally but I I want to give life I want you know God is says many things in an obscure fashion in Scripture but he says one thing at least very clearly which is a be fruitful and multiply go I keep having children be you know go out and give yourselves to children and that that openness makes perfect sense to me because there there has to be a purpose to it yeah you know so much of the prevailing postmodern culture is me allistic is just well we're just here and what it feels good do it man yeah and we're gonna have a nice sum of experiences and then we turn into warm food and so it's no surprise that in that culture divorce would flourish yeah but in a culture that believes that there is a purpose to marriage a central purpose of which is the openness to creating life and giving love and it seemed makes perfect sense to me that those couples would divorce at much lower rates I asked someone once who had a friend of mine who had has had a long marriage I said how have you had such a long marriage he said well the secret is don't get divorced in the in a civil marriage where the two parties enter into it without having a sense of what they're doing what they're doing together what they wanted her together what the purposes of their bodies and of their love and of their minds it's easier to just fall away when things go a little hard but if you preclude even the possibility of divorce because you don't want to make a fool of God it's it's seems much more reasonable that those couples would stay together and that their love would grow no no question about you know hearing you talk I almost want to stop writing to ELISA telling her to get out but I'll think about it I was I was gonna ask her what she felt about the pre-cana ceremony but obviously I had tape over her mouth and because I didn't I didn't want him to say something yeah you know yeah you don't listen to their opinions yeah I can all show it's gone I'm out of time but the Michael Knoll show is coming up next it will be talking about the women's marches and why everything they say is everything is allowed point by point I know it's great to see you you know I mean the thing about the body the thing about the flesh is it's very there it is very there it is very easy to believe in but that's true of words too but words refer to something that is not there but it's just as real and the flesh refers to something that is not there that is just as real which is the spirit and you have to focus on that to keep its reality in mind you have to have faith and you have to have focused to keep its reality in mind and that is what makes marriage is better let's talk about our crappy culture every time I every time I hear that music I turn into Steve Crowder you know Steven Steve is this amazing physical ability to dance and move around every time I hear that that's what I want to do but I don't have that ability so I don't know there's a lot of talk 'men going on Jordon Peterson's been on the show a couple times just a terrific psychologist from Canada who's been fighting the good fight against speech imposed by the government especially when it comes to transgender people he was on with the BBC's Kathy Newman and they were arguing about the wage gap which really doesn't exist between men and women I mean there is a wage gap between men and women but it has so many there's so many reasons for it that the idea that is simply one reason for that just gender is absurd and there was this moment that really caught my eye for a very specific reason which I told which I'll tell you in which Jordan and Kathy Newman were going at it about whether he should be forced to call transgender people buy whatever pronoun they want by the government and here's Kathy Newman making this the argument that he shouldn't have free speech of the offends people you cited freedom of speech in that why should your rights to freedom of speech Trump a trans person's right not to be offended because in order to be able to think you have to risk being offensive I mean look at the conversation we're having right now you know like you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth why should you have the right to do that it's being rather uncomfortable well I'm I'm very glad I put you get my point as like you're you're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the hell's going on saying that is what you should do but you're exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me and that's fine I think more power to as far as I'm concerned so you haven't sat there and just probably work that out I mean ha gotcha yeah I've got me you have got me what got me about this and this is not taking anything away from Jordan he is a brilliant brilliant man and a brave man and I've not taken one thing away from him but that's not a brilliant point it's an obvious point and what struck me about this is how only a woman who has been enclosed in a cocoon of the one opinion enclosed in this bubble of leftism could be caught so off-guard by that simple simple point that in order to think in order to question you have to be willing to offend and in order to be free and respect the person you're talking to you have to be willing to take some offense to be offended without constantly pulling the outrage card without constantly declaring yourself a victim I mean this is the amazing thing about the left is we talk here and we have arguments and we disagree and sometimes guys will come in sometimes Ben will come in and we'll go back and forth they have to throw Ben out a lot of times because they keep my show off the air because we will get into an argument but we we love arguing and we love discussing and we hear different opinions and we of course we hear the left because they own the media so we hear their opinions all the time she never does that took her totally off guard because she never ever heard it before all right it's the end of the show Cleveland this is the Andrew Clavin show we will be back again tomorrow be here then the Andrew Klavan show is produced by Robert Sterling executive
