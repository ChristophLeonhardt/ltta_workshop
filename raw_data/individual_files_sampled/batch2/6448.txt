the Democrats were promised by Mitch McConnell that after they agreed to give up all their leverage and vote for the Republican budget that the Republicans would then let them have a debate a hearing on immigration so that's where they go to protect dreamers the Democrats were quite excited by this Senator Chris Coons Democrat of Delaware said I've been here seven years and never seen anything like it who knows democracy may very well break out in here so excited we're gonna get a debate we're gonna get to finally talk about it and we're gonna propose the bill and there's gonna be a man Vincent finally immigration reform we're gonna do it especially daca and protecting the dreamers well Talking Points Memo reporting today that excitement quickly turned to frustration as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed Tuesday morning that he wants the entire debate on the half dozen plus competing proposals put forward so far by lawmakers to be over by the end of the week it's only a couple of days left now they debated how to end Obamacare for months on top of months let alone for years upon years with where they proposed and passed those that legislation in the house but when it comes to immigration reform congratulations you've got a couple of days and come to find out that the Democrats are shocked the chagrin but first the quote from Mitch McConnell rubbing it in he says senators have had plenty of time to prepare there's no reason why we should not reach a bipartisan solution this week I made a commitment to hold this debate and to hold it this week I've lived up to my commitment I hope everyone will cooperate so this opportunity does not go to waste in other words haha I said that I'd give you a chance to propose your bill I didn't tell you how long we were gonna consider it throws that we're gonna consider it for a couple of days and they shut this thing down idiots suckers I lived up to my commitment now the Democrats are in a panic wait wait wait we said two-week there's no way if you get that bill done in this couple of days and by the way the dreamers start getting deported March 5th now as always as usual is going to be on break next week they're almost always on break so you got a couple of days and that's it they start deporting people Senate democratic aide says Republican leadership shouldn't try to short-circuit bipartisan discussions at this point senators haven't agreed to any time limit Hugh morons you pathetic weasels what do we tell you we like Mitch McConnell man of his word he was gonna really give you a full hearing no it was always a trick right now in the House Paul Ryan's getting pressured to do a more draconian immigration bill not less more so you know what they're gonna do they say now if you want just a temporary pastor treatments for three years which expires later we want a permanent ban on family based immigration so in order to save the dreamers for three years we want a permanent ban illegal immigration plus money for the wall plus more ice ages to deport people and when plus end sanctuary cities absolutely draconian they're like here debate this Democrats know can anyone really be that and I even stupid now they knew the Republicans we're gonna screw them but they're not screwing the Democrats they're fine they're super comfortable they're screwing the dreamers and that actual progressives who cared about the issue but what is the last time the Democrats cared about that so here's Senator John Cornyn number two Republican in in the Senate rubbing it in he says Touche but who does have referring to earlier tweet but only deal was date and fair and open process delivered as promised coffees clock is ticking so I mentioned to see the Democrats counteroffer to POTUS is proposal that can become law none so far hey we just gave you a couple of days and within the last couple hours when we sprung this on you you didn't have a proposal ready tick tock tick tock clock is ticking haha only have two days left and then we end this and start deporting people idiot democrats and rubbing it into your face what do you think we were gonna be fair and open no we're gonna play a trick like we always do and then you go out there and do your job your job is to say in front of all the cameras well there was nothing we could do so true to form here come senator dick durbin this second leading Democrat in the Senate god help us he says I told Mitch McConnell looking him in the eye I trust you I think you made it clear that you're going to be fair on the floor and I've defended you to some Democrats who are skeptical and had that work out for you dick he played you for a fool but only for the millionth time in a row hey dick durbin and all the rest of you and Chris Coons etc why don't you just admit it you don't give a damn about progressives you never care about policy positions while you care about is though your own power and privilege and in the midst of that debate I told you guys a story heavily reported that the thing that the Democrats were most of upset about why they shut the government down for just three days you know Republicans and Democrats couldn't come to an agreement Democrats stood their ground for just three days why because they were mad that the Republicans had not properly consulted them so it was never about you it was never about your priorities it was never about the voters and when the Republicans are just south of them and promise them that their issues were to be interests at a later time after they give them their votes today the Democrats said oh of course of course of course oh don't threaten the markets all my donors are all incredibly rich and all their money's in the stock market I can't have a government shutdown I can't have the debt ceiling now lifted that would affect the beloved markets voters you know what dick Durbin finds out today that Mitch McConnell was not fair to him that he did not deliver on the promises he explained and dick Durbin is surprised for the 89th time in a row either dick Durbin is incredibly stupid one of the dumbest guys in the country or much more likely he's paid too loose by his donors and probably he doesn't even know it he said Co I don't know I everybody I was on the phone with because I was raising money for 5 hours a day hey rich person hey millionaire hey Bill you know what do you think oh the markets the markets oh my god I'm not shutting the government down I'm not shutting it down the rich don't want it to shut down I mean my bonus no that's your donors they don't want you to shut it down Dhaka well I never got a check from a dreamer I'll get to them like Oh Mitch McConnell lied to me Oh golly gee I've been tricked again these Democrats are the worst of the worst at least you see the Republicans unless you're a Democratic senator and a giant fool or pretending to be one you see the rub Republicans coming at you from the
