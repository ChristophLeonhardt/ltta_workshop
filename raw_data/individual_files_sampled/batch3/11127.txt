by up max keiser this is the Kaiser report the show that goes where no show has ever gone before where exactly that is we're still trying to figure that out Stacy hi max so you know you do a doubleheader with Michael Hudson dr. Michael Hudson that was in our last episode and he's in the second episode the second half of this episode today so I had the privilege of actually seeing what he has to say and it's very fascinating you really have to tune in for the second half with dr. Michael Hudson because he's looking at finance capitalism and international free trade so-called free trade and it's quite interesting because he talks about the high cost of living and the low wages and that's certainly something we see in America as more and more people and in the UK which is even more in France and Spain this notion of the precariat precarious jobs and the indignados and all these sort of sort of temporary temporary sort of unstable jobs so you're a gig worker at the gig economy you have uber or things like that but another way out of the ghetto of these gate jobs is to become a YouTube star so I have this interesting story about YouTube success on YouTube still means a life of poverty you can have a million views a month and still not be able to make rent new research out of Germany build as among the first to review the chances of making it in the new Hollywood shows a vanishingly small number will ever break through just like in the old Hollywood in fact 96.5% of all of those trying to become youtubers won't make enough money off of advertising to crack the US poverty line according to research by Mateus Bartle a professor at effenberg University of Applied Sciences in often burg even to get to the top 1% of YouTube stars the top 3% sorry you need one point like 2 or 4 million views per month on your youtubes but you're still making less than the minimum wage less than poverty wages in America you know back in the 1970s early early 1960s I used to visit with my family Times Square you know we'd go into New York and go into New York and they'd go to Times Square for example and at that time you could see the dancing chicken right so you put a 25 cent piece into the Machine there and out comes a dancing chicken it's a chicken that's on a plate an electric plate that's electrified and so the chicken is being slowly electrocuted today it was a real chicken yes indeed oh I don't know so it's like a big glass box mm-hmm in Times Square and you went and put a quarter in yep and they forced the chicken out onto the chicken comes out on an electric gets electrocuted essentially oh my god now this is YouTube you have millions of wanna be dancing chickens come out hopefully they'll get a like or a tweet but they're essentially they're narcissistically narcissism narcissism lling in themselves to death its death by narcissism well according to this article breaking into the top 3 percent of most viewed channels could bring in advertising revenue of about sixteen thousand eight hundred dollars a year barrel found in an analysis for Bloomberg News that's a bit more than the US federal poverty line of twelve thousand one hundred and forty four a single person the guideline for a two-person household is sixteen thousand four hundred and sixty the top three percent of video creators of all time and Bartel sample attracted more than 1.4 million views per month now the problem with this is that a lot of people are setting their basically hopes out of the gig economy ghetto on becoming one of these new Hollywood celebrities so one in three British children aged 6 to 17 told pollsters last year that they wanted to become a full-time youtuber that's three times as many as those who wanted to become a doctor or a nurse so one in three British children wants to become a YouTube star this is a total breakdown in the institutions that would make up a normally functioning society where you have doctors and lawyers and theologians and other professions and careers that make up a dynamic ecosystem of culture we have that all been eviscerated by the financialization of the economy starting back under the Reagan Thatcher years where everything was commodified securitized and traded and backed and secured and goldman sachs off' ID and vampire squid off' ID and now we have a whole generation that's just looking to expose themselves to death they want to be out there as exhibitionists as a freak show they could be the long haired lady or the snake swallowing boy or any number of freaks remember the movie freaks they would have the famous line in there one of us one of us one of us which is a great great siren song of YouTube it's they want you to become a freak they want to get you and your inner freak to out freak the next freak so they can of course take all that money to the bank well the other problem is of course the monopolization by YouTube of online video content viewing so they control the market and they feed people more and more into the top 1% of of YouTube stars so basically they guide people where they go and you see that in the charts that the article shows is that over the years the number of big stars any any content creator making more than a million views a month that's actually declining because it's being monopolized by fewer and fewer content creators and the other thing of course is that YouTube is now basically because of because Hilary lost to a reality TV star and as humiliating as any circus freak show in to a dancing chicken she lost she did and because of that she's a woman scorned and the whole the entire edifice of our society and infrastructure of our economy around us must be destroyed and YouTube is withdrawing ads from not only our Tea for example but from a lot of alternative media yes the the likes of Alex Jones but also the likes of TruthDig and alternative progressive media a lot of them are being D monetized so we've seen that with with the more fringe sort of characters say like luke rudkowski even though they get hundreds of thousands of views they they were demonetized first while nobody cared or listened and now they're coming for the bigger bigger names and soon you'll only be able to watch one dancing chicken well we saw the same thing with the network television network in the public airwaves and the spectrum of available telecommunications that were available to all kinds of commercial enterprises and the public and we had public access television and we had all kinds of shows that were in the public's interest and news was done in the public interest on the commercial interest and then you had this gradually transform into a purely public vehicle where the news was essentially squeezed out in favor of kind of rabid foaming at the mouth polemicists like Rachel Maddow and you have no actual kind of news as that word is to be understood now the same thing then in YouTube was launched and you had a democratization of media and people can out there they did their own shows and was quite rich and quite diverse and quite interesting but of course as the numbers got huge then you Google said went down the same path as network television that said we're gonna squeeze out all the independents we want to just promote a set number that we we make the money on because this even though the Internet is something that was publicly built it came out of the DARPA came out of the military came out of taxes without taxes without the Mewis government without the military there would be no YouTube there would be no internet and yet their payback for this a free ride this rent-seeking is to squeeze out all the diversity and give us dancing chickens which led to a dancing chicken president so don't look at overseas as the problem to your dancing chicken president look at YouTube you get the media consolidation look at les Moonves of CBS there's your dancing chicken president don't blame foreigners for your applause you freaking idiots so not only did little Max Keiser get to see these dancing chickens in Times Square but you also got to see ugly George who was an important character on public access television yes at least George was and the Robin burchett was also another public-access hit these were the I made my own TV show in the 1970s called the Kim Kaiser Show you can see portions of that on the YouTube we have yet to release the full catalog of the Kim Kaiser Show that I had in as a high schooler in Mamaroneck New York and also while you were in Times Square with putting quarters in there for the dancing chicken of course many people know about Travis Bickle he was also hanging out in Times Square in his taxi it could have been a movie but it seems like real life but of course he drove a yellow taxi taxi driver and that is in our next headline because they have been disintermediated by an algorithm uber drivers often make below minimum wage report finds some drivers end up losing money after insurance maintenance and other costs according to a study raising concerns over Labor Standards so this is a study out of MIT and uber and lyft drivers it turns out make basically as little as 8 dollars and 55 cents per hour the article the the researchers they did have a little bit of conflict with uber over the how they determine how much they actually get paid but nevertheless what the study finds is that uber and lyft basically rely on economic ignorance of these people applying for jobs taxi driver remade as uber driver Jodie Foster is a venture capitalist Travis Bickel isn't dot-com or a / cryptocurrency want to be and they conspire to take down the fiat currency system someday a real crip tail will come and wash away all this fiat Travis Bickel quote from uber driver directed by Martin Scorsese Coyne available in theaters now of course Travis Bickle was driving at that taxi who his company owned he was driving the car for them and by remembering that he had to like hose down the back of the car when everybody vomited and all the sex and all that crazy stuff that happened in the backseat well of course this is part of the cost that many of these drivers for uber and lyft don't factor in the damage to their vehicles the mileage on their vehicle the wear and tear the gasoline costs insurance costs all that such that 8% of drivers are actually losing money so they're just all Travis Bickel yeah every single one of us there's nobody that's escaping uber ization on the economy we're all working for below minimum wage at the end of the day if you factor in the ecological devastation of the dancing chicken effect and all the cruelty prone eggs who escapes this nightmare we call post industrialist post ironic post altcoin fantasies ation and infant totalization and narcissistic quasi reality here now something to think about during the break because we have to take a break when we come back we're gonna talk to dr. Michael Hudson don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm max Kaiser time now to return to our conversation with dr. Michael Hudson dr. Hudson welcome back to the console report to be here to continue so we were talking about Donald Trump and his new steel and aluminum tariffs and how that's gonna play out economically and we you know last time we kind of talked about how this could shut Wall Street out and that's an interesting concept you know if we can take this and go down this path a little bit but what do you mean by shuts Wall Street out and isn't that good I mean you know the economy has always been a battle between Main Street and Wall Street and certainly Wall Street's been winning the last 25 years certainly since the Reagan Thatcher era and neoliberalism and Main Street's been shut out Main Street the wages have been stagnant jobs have been lost so is this signaling kind of an era when Main Street can look forward to some gains here versus Wall Street and isn't that a positive thing and isn't that the way the cookie crumbles if you are working on Wall Street dr. Hudson well I don't think Trump's economic policies that don't favor Wall Street are the same as Bernie Sanders policies that don't favor Wall Street just because Wall Street loses doesn't mean automatically Main Street games there must I think there's a national security strategy by Trump I think the national security deep state has taken over and what they're trying to do is play a game of international diplomacy that is not going to help either Wall Street or Main Street they can both be losers if the economy is being mismanaged and it looks to me like Trump and the Republicans are mismanaging the economy for instance if if Trump wanted to help Wall Street what he would really do would be to build up infrastructure and some Sadat's infrastructure he would lower the cost of doing business for Wall Street let me jump in here for a second because you know America's biggest competition globally would be China China of course as an industrial policy and it's a top-down hierarchical approach and it with a bit of an iron fist now our alleged free-market ideology in America prevents our elected politicians from even offering this type of thing but in other words Ken how does America compete with China if China is going and America doesn't seem to have any problem with a lot of the inroads that China's making into our our technology space etc with surveillance technology this type of thing but in other words there's two highly contrasting attempts or styles of doing business here your comments it is impossible for a free market economy to compete internationally a free market economy is one of economic collapse and austerity look America didn't get rich by being a free market it got rich by being a protectionist country that's what my book is about America's protectionist take off in the nineteenth century America had the idea was if we build America is a mixed economy with a public sector providing education roads railroads and all of the infrastructure in a subsidized Coster freely then our business can hire labor and do business at a lower cost than other countries that are privatized in free market so America got rich by not being a free market China's getting rich by following the exact same policy that made America rich in Germany rich and other industrial countries by having a mixed economy where the government provides most of what's there called externalities transportation costs communication costs education costs water sewage all of these in America the infrastructure is breaking down and is being privatized to increase the cost Trump's tax cut vastly increases the cost of doing business and it financial eise's the economy all right let me jump in because that's an interesting points in other words if you have the infrastructure like roads hospitals education these types of parts of the economy that add to aggregate gross domestic product in intangible ways and tangible ways while allowing the free market to exist in things like computers and soft drinks and you know things that are commercially competing out there you end up with this mixed economy in the best of both worlds but in America and also in Britain you have now the privatization of things like transportation of railway it becomes vastly more expensive it doesn't work ideologically or theoretically you don't want two ends of a railway system competing with each other because then you get stuck breaking down in the middle as you have in the UK or Amtrak is I don't know if they I don't know what the current status is of Amtrak but anyway so you have this mixed economy right and that's the best of both worlds but in this country and elsewhere they privatized those elements and now you if the come up with a competitive edge is really been destroyed right yes what you call a privatized economy is really a financialized economy where the financial sector cuts off every bit of infrastructure privatizes that finances it on very expensive credit with interest charges stock buyback programs management charges overhead capital gains and America will end up looking like Margaret Thatcher in England and they call that a free market economy but it's really elapse from industrial capitalism as we know it in the 19th and early 20th century back into a kind of cute' alized economies you and I've spoken about before and it's a it's a retrogression from capitalism industrial capitalism and it's even either call it finance capitalism or neo feudalism but it's going to be very high cost of living high cost of doing business like in competition and the only way you can really protect this is militarily with a national security state and the military industrial complex and that's not something that benefits either Wall Street or Main Street that's a is something that is basically simply parasitic changing gears for a second I want to pick your brain on something here everyone from Jack Ma to Mark Zuckerberg have been warning about the impending artificial intelligence job apocalypse do you agree the most workers will be displaced by machines or algorithms is there anything we should do as a society prepare for so what is your current thinking on the AI trend in jobs and economics dr. Hudson this argument goes back 200 years Ricardo Marx and other people were saying is mechanization going to replace labour or not and Marx isn't answer was no it's not going to because instead of more and more workers are going to be employed in the capital goods industries that are making the machines that displace manual labour so what you're going to have is an upgrading of labour from the old manual labor to the machine making labor well the same argument that was waged in the nineteenth century can be waged now in the 20th century how many workers are going to be employed in the artificial intelligence industry how many imagine all of the all of the gas stations that are going to get more business as the self-driving cars all smash into each other a mansion the increase in the hospitals is the self-driving car automatic intelligence lab cars run over pedestrians you know who knows you know how many extra jobs are going to be created by this so let me jump in for a second and let's go off on a wild tangent here as we normally do so you talk about Ricardo and Marx and 19th century economic models and how this is not any different but I would posit that it is different because in the case of the algorithmically driven high-tech economy that we're now living in the cost of the raw materials the digits that go into this economy are zero zero this is completely new never seen in the history of economics so in a case of uber you know they have uber drivers working at under below the minimum wage because ubers a platform that algorithmically controls millions of customers and thousands of taxi drivers taking advantage of the fact that they're wrong Tyrael cost digits electrons to them is basically zero same thing with Google a same thing with all these major platforms Facebook it's it the platform is resting on a reservoir of raw material that costs zero and so things are trending down it's highly deflationary in this regard and so therefore this artificial intelligence again are algorithmically driven is tapping into this asymptotic curve of raw material cost is zero and that's highly deflationary isn't that a seismic change in economics and the models that have been looked at and examined now for 200 years dr. Hudson yes I have to admit you're right it is a seismic change and it's a race to the bottom and it goes hand in hand with occation that you're seeing so to the extent that the artificial intelligence may it doesn't mean higher quality of life it may very well mean the kind of managerial program that's put in results in a lower quality of life for most people just like the uber drivers earn less than the minimum wage the people going to work for Amazon are notoriously short lived there they're burned out it's a place where the work is apparently or are feeling pretty exploited so bright into this mix Donald Trump is coming out and saying hey you know we're gonna put some extra tax dollars in your pocket in the form of cash we're gonna we're going to bring tariffs on to give steel workers some highways jobs and you know this is a vote winner in against a backdrop of fear the average worker is scared to death because they also implicit in this kind of cycle economically would be a trend toward higher inflation anyway as we're now entering into an era of higher interest rates etc trade wars are not deflationary dr. Hutson they tend to be inflationary aren't they another thing backing up your point of that modern IP is different from industrial technology in the 19th century high wage labor undersold low wage labor it was called poorer labor the idea was that once you have machinery you're going to have to have more and more highly skilled highly trained better fed and rested labor in order to operate it so you had an upgrading of labor all during the industrial revolution as a result of this mechanization new labor increased its living standards in order to be able to perform the higher quality work job industrial work jobs but now under Industrial Technology it's like how the Navy designed by geniuses to be run by idiots and you're going to treat labor is essentially your turn you're turning labor into low quality repetitive a servomechanism type labor rather than the highly skilled labor that the people thought was going to lead from industrial capitalism into socialism and better living standards fair enough now what's your latest book by the way AJ is junk for J for junk economics is at the latest that's know my latest book I'll be coming out with another one in May oh no no see it on the New York Times bestseller list I see Nassim Taleb z' book up there and his it's just recycling the same things over and over and over again there's nothing and that seemed to Levis book we haven't seen already a hundred times you're actually bringing something fresh to the table how come you're not on the New York Times bestseller list this is a travesty dr. Hudson because I'm the kind of person that you have on your show not the kind of person that the New York Times likes to celebrate they review books that advertise in the New York Times and I don't advertise I go on your Oh fair enough yeah that's right tell em never comes always out here once I got to say we got a mob back alright maybe you two should be on for a debate soon dr. Hudson thanks for being on the Kaiser report it's always good to be here match alright well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me Max Keiser and Stacy ever I'd like to thank our guest dr. Michael Hudson latest book J for junk economics if you want to catch us on Twitter its cause a report until next time bye Oh
