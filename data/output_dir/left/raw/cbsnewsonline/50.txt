00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,509
THAT WALK, YOU KNOW WHERE I AM. 

553
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:42,447
I COULD KNOCK IT OUT -- BECAUSE 

554
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,282
I DO THAT WELL -- THAT'S WHAT I 

555
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,416
DO WELL, I BUILD. 

556
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,118
WE COULD KNOCK THAT WALL OUT IN 

557
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,686
ONE YEAR IF THEY GAVE US THE 

558
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:49,621
FUNDS. 

559
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,789
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THOUGH, IF 

560
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,790
YOU LOOK AT SCHUMER AND THESE 

561
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,293
PEOPLE, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW 

562
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,661
YOU NEED THE WALL, THEY VOTED 

563
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,396
FOR THE WALL IN 2006, THEY 

564
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,899
VOTED FOR BORDER SECURITY. 

565
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:01,533
AND THEN THEY FOUND OUT, GEE, 

566
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,167
MAYBE, FROM THEIR STANDPOINT, 

567
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,203
THEY CAN'T DO THAT, BUT THEY 

568
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,037
ALL VOTED FOR IT. 

569
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,339
HILLARY CLINTON VOTED FOR IT, 

570
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,073
RIGHT? 

571
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:08,440
REMEMBER HER? 

572
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,407
>> [ BOOING ] 

573
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:13,345
>> BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I'LL 

574
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,114
TELL YOU THIS -- EVERYBODY 

575
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:21,252
KNOWS --

576
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:35,233
>> [ CHANTING ] LOCK HER UP! 

577
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,701
>> HOW IS OUR JUSTICE 

578
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,836

579
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:41,439
>> [ BOOING ]

580
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:49,080
>> SO THEY ALL WANTED THE WALL. 

581
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,382
WE ARE GOING TO GET THE WALL. 

582
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:53,151
BUT IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER IF 

583
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,119
YOU GET REPUBLICANS IN THEIR TO 

584
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:54,853
VOTE, PLEASE, OKAY? 

585
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,254
A LOT EASIER. 

586
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,492
BECAUSE THEIR WHOLE AGENDA ON 

587
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,827
BIGGER THINGS, WE CAN GET, YOU 

588
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,329
SEE WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN, WE'VE 

589
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,530
GOT THINGS THAT -- WE'VE GOT 

590
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,530
700 BILLION TO REBUILD OUR 

591
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:06,797
MILITARY. 

592
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:09,401
WE THEN GOT 716 BILLION TO 

593
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:17,876
REBUILD IT SECOND YEAR, 700 AND 

594
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:18,209
$716 BILLION. 

595
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:18,843
BUT THEIR WHOLE AGENDA, THEY 

596
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,478
KNOW WE WANT THE WALL, THEY 

597
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:25,250
WANT TO OPPOSE IT, THEY WANT TO 

598
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,785
OBSTRUCT IT, THEY WANT TO 

599
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,518
RESIST, YOU KNOW THE CAMPAIGN? 

600
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:27,952
IT'S CALLED RESIST. 

601
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:28,920
HONESTLY, THEY ARE LOUSY 

602
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,924
POLITICIANS, THEIR POLICY IS 

603
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,559
TERRIBLE, BUT THEY ARE GOOD AT 

604
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,026
STICKING TOGETHER AND 

605
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,194
RESISTING, THAT'S ALL THEY CAN 

606
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:39,864
DO. 

607
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,066
AND YOU ARE WITNESSING IT RIGHT 

608
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,634
NOW, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE 

609
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,401
VICTORIOUS. 

610
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:43,701
YOU WATCH. 

611
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:48,540
YOU WATCH. 

612
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,208
IT'S ALL THERE GOOD AT, RESIST, 

613
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,543
YOU KNOW THEY SEE THE SIGNS,

00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:59,918
RESIST, RESIST, OH. 

615
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:00,852
WE ARE FOR BUILDING GREAT 

616
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:01,352
ECONOMIES, THEY ARE FOR 

617
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:02,386
RESISTING, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL 

618
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:03,121
ABOUT. 

619
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,188
BUT THIS ELECTION, YOU HAVE TO 

620
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:07,359
VOTE FOR CANDIDATES WHO REALLY 

621
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,096
KNOW WHAT YOUR HEART SAYS, WHAT 

622
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,333
YOUR VALUES ARE. 

623
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,735
YOU HAVE SOME GREAT, GREAT 

624
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,235
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. 

625
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,303
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT 

626
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,405
I AM ALWAYS ANGRY AT CONGRESS. 

627
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:24,208
I'M ANGRY AT DEMOCRATS. 

628
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,610
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING 

629
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,645
TO OUR COUNTRY. 

630
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,414
I'M ANGRY AT DEMOCRATS BECAUSE 

631
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:33,685
OF WHAT THEY DO TO OUR COUNTRY. 

632
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,688
TODAY'S DEMOCRAT PARTY IS HELD 

633
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:42,794
HOSTAGE BY LEFT-WING HATERS, 

634
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,028
ANGRY MOBS, SOCIALIST FANATICS, 

635
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,531
DEEP STATE BUREAUCRATS, AND 

636
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,231
THEIR FAKE NEWS ALLIES. 

637
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:49,334
THIS IS THE BIG -- THAT'S THEIR 

638
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,070

639
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,804
>> [ BOOING ] 

640
00:27:52,804 --> 00:28:08,820
>> THAT'S THEIR BEST PARTNER.

00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,698
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, THEIR BEST 

642
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,601
ALLY IS THOSE PEOPLE RIGHT 

643
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,869
THERE.

>> [ BOOING ]

00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,344
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW 

646
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:37,382
DISHONEST AND CORRUPT SO MUCH 

647
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,917
OF THE MEDIA IS, I CAN'T EVEN 

648
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,217
EXPLAIN IT. 

649
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:43,387
IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN, NOBODY 

650
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,390
WOULD BELIEVE HE HAD, NOBODY 

651
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:45,623
WOULD. 

652
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:46,958
AND I DON'T MEAN EVERYTHING, 

653
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,459
YOU HAVE SOME FINE PEOPLE, SOME 

654
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:49,460
FINE REPORTERS, I KNOW THEM, 

655
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,662
FINE REPORTERS, LOOK, ALL THE 

656
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,097
RED LIGHTS ARE STARTING TO GO 

657
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:52,897
OFF. 

658
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,965
YOU HAVE SOME FINE PEOPLE AND 

659
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,368
SOME WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, 

660
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,236
PROFESSIONAL REPORTERS. 

661
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:03,308
BUT I WATCH THE COVERAGE THAT 

662
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:03,541
WE GET. 

663
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,943
AND IT IS SO UNFAIR, WE COULD 

664
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,179
HAVE THE GREATEST SUCCESS, LIKE 

665
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,013
FOR INSTANCE IN NORTH KOREA, 

666
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,449
WE'RE DOING GREAT, MOVING 

667
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:11,682
ALONG. 

668
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:12,383
WHAT DID THEY SAY? 

669
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,250
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN SAY. 

670
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,353
SO THEY SAY HE MET WITH THEM! 

671
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,290
THAT'S A DEFEAT BECAUSE WE MET? 

672
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,291
THEY CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE, 

673
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,592
WE HAVE THE HOSTAGES -- THEY 

674
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:24,062
SAID HE MET! 

675
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,497
SO MANY THINGS THEY COME UP -- 

676
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:27,866
AND THEN THEY SAY IT'S NOT 

677
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,632
MOVING FAST ENOUGH. 

678
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:29,334
THEY'VEBEEN COVERING THESE 

679
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,034

680
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,738
HAVEN'T DONE A THING. 

681
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,874
I LEFT, WHAT DID I LEAVE, THREE 

682
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:36,174
MONTHS AGO? 

683
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:36,807
WE'RE DOING GREAT. 

684
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:38,076
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WILL 

685
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:45,116
TAKE A GREAT STORY AND MAKE IT 

686
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,050
AS BAD AS POSSIBLE. 

687
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,786
THEY'LL TAKE AN OKAY STORY AND 

688
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,186
MAKE IT HORRIBLE. 

689
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,922
SO I CANNOT TELL YOU STRONGLY 

690
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:53,892
ENOUGH, THAT IS THE SING 

691
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,127
GREATEST ALLY OF THE DEMOCRATS. 

692
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:01,466
WITHOUT THEM, THEY WOULDN'T BE 

693
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,399
GETTING 5% OF THE VOTE. 

694
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,735
I'LL TELL YOU, THAT'S TRUE. 

695
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,035

696
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,236
FAKE NEWS.

00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,905
AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY 

698
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:13,044
THIS, WHEN I WON THE ELECTION, 

699
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,145
WE WON, I DIDN'T WIN, WE WON, 

700
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,546

THEY APOLOGIZED TO THEIR 

704
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,461
SUBSCRIBERS, BECAUSE THEY 

705
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,595
COVERED THE ELECTION SO BADLY. 

706
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:36,334
BECAUSE THEIR SUBSCRIBERS SAY

00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,101
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? 

708
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,536
HE GOT NOTHING BUT BAD STORIES. 

709
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,872
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T READ "THE

711
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:42,372
BECAUSE IT'S A DISHONEST 

712

NEWSPAPER. 

713
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:44,909
IT'S TERRIBLE. 

714
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:45,576
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL 

715
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:50,114
TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN WE WON, 

716
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:50,481
THEY SUFFERED. 

717
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,985
BUT I SAID, I SAID, I GOT ONE 

718
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,320
THING THAT I WAS -- IN 

719
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,355
INTERVIEWS, I SAID, YOU KNOW 

720
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,022
THE GOOD NEWS? 

721
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,892
I'LL START NOW, GETTING FAIR 

722

723
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,262
AND IT HAPPENED FOR ABOUT A 

724
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,197
WEEK. 

725
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,966
AND NOW THEY'RE WORSE THAN THEY 

726
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:08,266
EVER WERE. 

727
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:12,704
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE 

728
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,904
MUCH OF AN IMPACT, DOES IT? 

729
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:16,040
NOT MUCH OF AN IMPACT. 

730
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:22,079
SO THE RESISTANCE TO AN EXTENT, 

731
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,183
BECAUSE OF THEM, IS FILLED WITH 

732
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,919
ANGER, BECAUSE THEIR POLICIES 

733
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,556

THEY SAY CONGRATULATIONS. 

1293
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:41,084
SOME OF THEM ARE SAYING THAT 

1294
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,520
THEY ARE EMULATING US, BUT MOST 

1295
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,287

00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,931
OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN RESPECTED. 

1301
00:53:54,931 --> 00:54:08,745

1302
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,115

I WAS HERE A LOT. 

1309
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,032
I WAS HERE A LOT BEFORE I DID 

1310
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:29,599
THIS POLITICAL THING. 

1311
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,867
BY THE WAY, HOW DID THAT WORK 

1312
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:31,067
OUT? 

1313
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:36,373
THAT WORKED OUT OKAY. 

1314
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:40,243
BUT, PLEASE, REMEMBER IT COULD 

1315
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:40,943
BE VERY FRAGILE. 

1316
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:43,947
IF YOU HAVE THE WRONG PEOPLE IN 

1317
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,748

1318

1322
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:56,426
DECISIONS AND THEY WILL MAKE 

1323
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,294
