and my hope is the president like coming in takes a similarly constructive approach finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align but that the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms and I don't expect that the president-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach but my hope is is that he does not simply take a real politic approach and suggest that you know if we just cut some deals with Russia even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria that we just do whatever is convenient at the time
