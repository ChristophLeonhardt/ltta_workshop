00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:14,999
AT THE SAME TIME, THIS IS A

>> Harris: IT'S INTERESTING,

67
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,529
HISTORICALLY A VOTE FOR CLOSURE

68
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,663
IS SOMETIMES AN INDICATION OF

69
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:46,597
HOW AN INDIVIDUAL WILL VOTE

70
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:47,632
MOVING FORWARD.

71
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,033
AFTER WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH

00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:49,901
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE RECENTLY IN

00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,036
LAST FEW DAYS, WE CAN'T REALLY

74
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:53,304
DETERMINE THAT BY HISTORY SO

75
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:54,772

BEGAN AND WE ARE GOING TO

00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,023
CONTINUE THOSE EFFORTS RIGHT UP

85
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,357
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE BECAUSE IT

86
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:15,059
IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN

87
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,760
OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY AND WE

88
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,728
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING

89
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:18,429
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET THE

90
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,766
FINAL VOTE DONE AND GET JUDGE

91
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,633
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED AND WE HOPE

92
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:25,103
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND.

93
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,538
>> Harris: THE TIMING OF IT IS

94
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,340
WHEN MANY AMERICANS WILL BE ABLE

95
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,242
TO PAUSE ON A WEEKEND AND TAKE A

96
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:34,545
LOOK AT HISTORY BEING MADE UP OR

97
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:35,947
DOWN ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH, SO THE

98
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:36,714
TIMING OF IT IS INTERESTING.

99
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:40,351
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING,

100
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,186
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF YOU GOT

00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:42,553
EVERYBODY?

102
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:44,021
AND IT WAS A DAY WHEN YOU GET

103
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:46,924
90% OF THE SENATORS TO PUT THEIR

104
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:49,460
POLITICS ASIDE, AND YOU SEE DEMS

105
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,595
AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER.

106
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:51,262
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT JOE

107
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:53,698
MANCHIN WAS A "YES" TO MOVE THE

108
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,968
NOMINATION PROCESS FORWARD, A

109
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:57,969
DEMOCRAT FROM WEST VIRGINIA?

110
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,470
>> Secretary Sanders: FRANKLY,

111
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,304
I'M SURPRISED MORE DEMOCRATS

112
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:00,905
AREN'T SUPPORTING JUDGE

113
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:01,372
KAVANAUGH.

114
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:02,607
WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE VERY

115
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:05,543
BEGINNING THE IMPECCABLE

116
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:06,777
QUALIFICATIONS THAT HE HAS AND

117
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:07,712
YOU ARE VERY RIGHT IN SAYING

118
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:09,947
THAT THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A

119
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:10,548
PARTISAN BATTLE.

120
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,250
THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A

121
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,151
POLITICAL BATTLE.

122
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,152
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A

123
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,987
DETERMINATION ON WHETHER OR NOT

124
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,055
SOMEBODY HAD THE RIGHT

125
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:21,359
TEMPERATURE, THE RIGHT

126
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,127
QUALIFICATIONS TO SIT ON THE

127
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,729
SUPREME COURT AND EVERYTHING YOU

128
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,730
SHOULD SEE IN A SUPREME COURT

129
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:26,531
JUSTICE IN BRETT KAVANAUGH AND

130
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:27,965
IT IS A SHAME THAT IT HAS BECOME

131
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,400
A POLITICAL BATTLE AND IT'S NO

132
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:31,169
LONGER ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT

133
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,071
BUT IT'S ABOUT PARTISAN POLITIC

134
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:34,438
POLITICS.

135
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,940
LOSING THE DEMOCRATS PLAY JUST A

136
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:36,674
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME THAT

137
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,375
HAS EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AND

138
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:40,144
THAT'S A REAL DISGRACE TO THE

139
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:42,113
COUNTRY, A DISGRACE TO THE

140
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:42,780
PROCESS, BUT HOPEFULLY MAYBE

141
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:43,915
SOME OF THEM WILL CHANGE THEIR

142
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,050
MIND AND GET ON BOARD INTO THE

143
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,152
RIGHT THING TO HAVE HOW THIS

144
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:49,220

00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,321

>> Harris: I WANT TO TALK

149
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,327
ABOUT ALSO WHAT WAS A SURPRISE

150
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:56,994
IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS, AND

151
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:59,964
THUS TO SEE AN OPINION PIECE BY

152
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:03,935

153
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:04,535
VOTE.

154
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,637
WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE THINK

155
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:07,638
ABOUT THIS SO-CALLED CLOSING

156
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,907
ARGUMENT AND WHETHER IT WAS

157
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:10,942
NEEDED?

158
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:12,176
>> Secretary Sanders: JUDGE

159
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:12,877
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT

160
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:13,744
THROUGHOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE

161
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:14,946
PROCESS.

162
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:17,682
HE HAS PUT FORWARD MORE

163
00:04:17,683 --> 00:04:20,151
DOCUMENTATION, MORE PAPER, MORE

164
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:21,719
HOURS OF TESTIMONY THAN ANY

165
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,553
OTHER NOMINEE IN HISTORY.

166
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,588
THIS IS ANOTHER MOMENT OF HIM

167
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:26,324
SAYING I'M AN OPEN BOOK, I'VE

168
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,326
BEEN TRANSPARENT FROM THE

169
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:28,960
BEGINNING OF THIS ENTIRE

170
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,660
PROCESS, I'M GOING TO CONTINUE

171
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:33,231
TO BE THAT WAY, AND YOU CAN

172
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,099
EXPECT THAT SAME TYPE OF

173
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,866
MENTALITY AND TEMPERAMENT WHEN I

174
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:38,502
SIT ON THE COURT.

175
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,438
THE WEATHER SEEMS TO BE A SHIFT

176
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,639
IN DEMOCRATS CRITICISM OF THE

177
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,307
JUDGE GOING FROM THE ALLEGATIONS

178
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:43,341
JUDGE GOING FROM THE ALLEGATIONO

179
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,575
JUDGE GOING FROM THE ALLEGATIONF

180
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,309
MISCONDUCT AGAINST HIM

181
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,344
TO HOW EMOTIONAL HE GOT

182
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:48,379
PAID AND IN THE OP-ED LAST

183
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,181
NIGHT, KAVANAUGH SAID I WAS VERY

184
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:51,182
EMOTIONAL LAST THURSDAY, MORE

185
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:52,550
THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN.

186
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:53,751
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL

187
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,553
AT TIMES.

188
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:56,721
I KNOW THAT MY TONE WAS SHARP

189
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:58,322
AND I SAID A FEW THINGS I SHOULD

190
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,324
NOT HAVE SAID.

191
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:00,791
IS THAT HELPFUL?

192
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,260
>> Secretary Sanders: FOR ME,

193
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,061
I THINK THAT IN A MOMENT WHERE

194
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:06,030
IF YOU FEEL YOU WERE BEING

195
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,599
WRONGFULLY ACCUSED, YOU ARE

196
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,234
DEFENDING NOT JUST YOURSELF, BUT

197
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:11,936
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FAMILY'S NAME

198
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,738
AND FRANKLY THE ENTIRE PROCESS

199
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,406
THAT ALLOWS SOMEBODY TO BECOME A

200
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:16,540
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, YOU HAVE

201
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,408
EVERY RIGHT       RIGHT TO BE EO

202
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:17,441

RIGHT TO FIGHT BACK AND DEFEND

208
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:23,547
YOURSELF AGAINST THOSE

209
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:23,948
ACCUSATIONS.

210
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,284
I THOUGHT HIS TONE IN LAST

211
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,152
WEEK'S HEARING WAS EXACTLY WHAT

212
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,687
YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM SOMEBODY

213
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:30,955
GOING THROUGH WHAT BRETT

214
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:31,656
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY HAVE

215
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:34,025
BEEN THROUGH OVER THE LAST

216
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:35,726
SEVERAL WEEKS, AND I THINK HE IS

217
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,128
GOING TO MAKE A GREAT

218
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:37,862
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHEN WE

219
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:39,563
SEE HIS CONFIRMATION GO THROUGH

220
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,765
LATER THIS WEEKEND.

221
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:41,399
>> Harris: WE ARE LETTING

222
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,569
SOMETIME BETWEEN 3:30      3:30.

223
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,570
EASTERN WITH THE NATION IN THE

224
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:48,239
WORLD WATCHING, WE WILL SEE A

225
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,573
VOTE ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

226
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:51,242
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD

227
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:52,810
ON WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF

228
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,546
THE PRESIDENT BUILDING A LEGACY.

229
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:56,213
>> Secretary Sanders: THIS

230
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:57,648
WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST

231
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,383
IMPACTFUL THINGS HE DOES.

232
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,885
THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD AN

233
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,286
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL FIRST TWO

234
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,154
YEARS IN OFFICE.

235
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,822
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, HE'S

236
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,556
MAKING TRADE DEALS THAT PEOPLE

237
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:07,725
SAID WERE NEVER GOING TO BE

238
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:08,526
POSSIBLE.

239
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,961
HE IS SECURING THE BORDER, HE IS

240
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:11,962
DOING ONE THING AFTER THE NEXT

241
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:13,364
THAT HE PROMISED TO DO ON THE

242
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,332
CAMPAIGN AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING

243
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,200
TO SEE TAKE PLACE THIS WEEKEND

244
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,568
IS ANOTHER FULFILLMENT OF THE

245
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:18,969
PRESIDENT'S PROMISE TO THE

246
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,037
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HE MADE AND

247
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,672
I HOPE WE WILL ALSO SEE THAT

248
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,174
REFLECTED IN PEOPLE WANTED TO

249
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:23,941
CONTINUE THAT PROGRESS WHEN THEY

250
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,077
VOTE IN NOVEMBER.

251
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:26,911
TO BE WHAT I AM LOOKING AT THAT

252
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:29,313
49 YEAR LOW OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND

253
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:32,650
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT BRINGING THE

254
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:35,119
COUNTRY TOGETHER AFTER THIS IS

255
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,820
ALL OVER, THAT'S WHERE WE

256
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,555
ALL HOPE THAT WE CAN GET.

257
00:06:37,556 --> 00:00:00,000
NO MATTER HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT
