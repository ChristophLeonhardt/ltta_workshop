a Transylvania student in Kentucky has been disenrolled from the University that he's been going to because of the fact that he thought it would be a good idea to harass one of his peers on social media because she happens to be a dreamer now Taylor rag is the name of the guy who decided it was a good idea to harass a fellow student rag posted a picture of senior Paola Garcia on Facebook in August saying quote everyone go report this illegal at my school bragging about breaking the law so here's a screenshot of what was put out there everyone go report this illegal okay and then he also provides a photo of Paola now things got really bad when she started receiving threatening messages from all sorts of people and so she went to administrators and hoped that they would have some sort of solution she claims that at first they didn't do anything about it and so she took matters into her own hands and she published a six-minute long YouTube video and we have a portion of it for you let's take a quick look over the summer a student at Transylvania University posted me on a racial hatred page called the tenth Crusade enthusiasts with the comment everyone got report this illegal at my school bragging about breaking the law that night I received numerous messages on Facebook from four members of that group threatening me with ice someone actually sent me pictures of him filling out a tip form to Homeland Security I received messages like I can't wait till you're fucking cut ass is gone you and your end wanted a boyfriend need to leave and hope you enjoyed your visit back to them dirt floors of your homeland stinky house after that video was published the university actually did take some action and they are not disclosing exactly what they did whether they expelled him or he decided to leave the school on his own I'm guessing and this is speculation that they probably expelled him but here's what Powell I had to say I don't have to walk across the graduation stage with him but I also feel that this isn't over yet rags only response to a request for comment on Tuesday was to say that the Herald Leader which has been covering this story is quote fake news he has since taken down his Facebook page ok so I I think this one's actually harder than I think you think it is so alright let's let's just talk her through so she is first of all she's undocumented immigrant brought into the country when she was 2 she didn't choose it as a two-year-old item maybe I have to explain that to the right-wing no two year-olds you know they make those decisions on their own they somehow miraculously cross the border without their documents and then they stay here for the rest of their lives I mean at 2 years old you have the ability to do that right so let's go ahead and punish them and harass them and treat them as if they're like subhumans so representative Steve King on TV today literally referred to dreamers and said that they chose to broke the break the lawn yeah representative Steve King is the scum of the earth okay and so are the people who decided to vote such a hateful person into the office into office really children as young as to knowingly came into the country illegally dreamers specifically dreamers are people who are brought into the country without their consent without knowing what was going on because they came in as children like if you're unable to see that I mean I I don't know what else to say to you yes so in this case Paulo was two that this is her case so of course I agree on all that III don't so she is an undocumented immigrant he points out that she's an undocumented and we're gonna puts up her picture do I think it's a bad idea absolutely terrible idea I it could lead to her harassment and it could even maybe even in the Trump ear might even lead to her deportation what a horrible horrible thing to do to somebody who's this is the only country she's ever known what you would send her back to a place she never grew up in doesn't know I don't know if she knows the language I don't know which countries is from so it's just it's such a terrible thing to do so so first of all at the moment she's protected by Daka so yeah you're not gonna get her deported because daca hasn't you know stopped protecting her yet okay obviously there's still a little bit of time before Congress needs to act but it would happen as quickly as six months that's true it could happen as quickly as six months if you know Congress doesn't reach a deal or if you know Trump continues going back and forth on this issue but look put the deportation part of it aside because at the moment she's not at risk of deportation but here's what did happen she started receiving significant harassment from all of these random people who don't know her and he is the person her peer is the person who directed all this harassment toward her right you can't have that like what is wrong with that guy really like are you you have that much free time that you're gonna create this campaign to harass a fellow student yeah no I of course look it's a terrible thing to do but the question is should he be expelled for that and he's pointing out that she's undocumented she is undocumented she doesn't deny it and you know him encouraging others to do something about it is the part where I think you've got a really great case that that is harassment so but I just think that it's a little bit tougher issue as an administrator you know this is where it's on the line he didn't he didn't say somebody go assault her like Kelly did with Hillary Clinton he you know but you it was needless incitement I just don't know if it means that you should be expelled at a school by the way we don't know for sure that he was he might have left voluntarily by the way if you were progressive Taylor rags names though all over the place and as pictures now all over the place don't harass him either right that's right you know why because we're not dicks okay we're not unreasonable illogical people that would direct any group to go harass someone simply because we disagree with anything that they're doing now I completely disagree with what he's doing and if I were an administrator at a university and I saw this type of harassment taking place I would absolutely consider expulsion and this is not about political speech I have an issue with the fact that he has created a hostile educational environment for this student who has never caused any trouble who hasn't bothered him in any way he just need lessly out of nowhere decided to direct all this harassment toward her now if he wanted to share his opinion about her in class while they're having a discussion about you know deportations or undocumented immigrants I think that speech should happen and it should be protected and I have no problem with that my problem is him directing the harassment toward this student who has done nothing wrong and at the moment is protected by Daka yeah and so he might have thought he might have seen in the news that were Trump under the Trump administration ice has deported people who have spoken out about being undocumented who were not protected by Daka so being a political speech about how undocumented immigrants should be protected and ice what we cover the story ice would come in and arrest them right afterwards and deport them so and I know the right-wingers take great relish in that but III understand exactly what you're saying and when he said and it's a quote that she read to you everyone go report this illegal at my school breaking about bragging about breaking the law it's I've worried that it's an incitement to action to go after her at the same time he didn't say assault or he said report her so I just think it's a little bit tougher but he should have never done in the first place and I feel terrible for Paula two to go through that kind of intimidation and I certainly understand her her worry about what might happen to her on campus and she was also worried that the university didn't react quickly enough to it which as you can tell here I don't know if they reacted quickly enough but how they reacted I have some sympathy for because I think they were it's a pretty tough situation to be in well they have to go through protocol you know you you can't just have a knee-jerk reaction so I'm actually not that critical of how the university responded you do have to go through the proper channels to ensure that you don't you're not overly punitive okay so it is what it is but my issue is that we now live in this environment where Trump has emboldened like kids this guy's a kid right he's emboldened children to be this vicious toward one another and it's disgusting yeah that 100% agree on it so if earlier we we wouldn't had a situation where people thought it was like a cool thing to do to to try to get people that they don't agree with removed from the country I mean and ripped away from their families and all that that goes along with it he Trump has just made this country a much uglier place and and is it worse to see the racism out of the closet yes I prefer they kept it in the closet because it has real consequences for real people watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded or stream it watch it anyway you like a TYT Network
