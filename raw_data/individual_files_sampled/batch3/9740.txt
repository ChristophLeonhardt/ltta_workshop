WACKY OMAROSA LOOK LEGITIMATE AS POSSIBLE." ED? Ed: TRACE GALLAGHER, I CLAIMS FROM OMAROSA MANIGUAULT NEWMAN AND REVEAL NEW INFORMATION OF HER ARM, THE FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR THE 2016 TRUMP CAMPAIGN, CURRENT SENIOR ADVISOR DEVICE 2020 REELECTION MISQUOTED AND OMAROSA'S NEW BOOK. GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING, THANKS FOR HAVING ME. Ed: I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THE BOOK, ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS TRUE OR NOT. THAT THE TAPE WAS OF THE TRUMP USING THE N-WORD. SOMEONE WHO KNEW FRANK LUNTZ TOLD HER THAT HE HAD HEARD IT. THE LONGTIME TRUMP AIDE REPORTED SHE ASKED TRUMP ABOUT IT ON THE PLANE, WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE SUCH TREY TATE MIGHT EXIST AND TO DO AND KATRINA CURSED AND SAID, HE SAID." DID THAT HAPPEN? NO. IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S WRITING A SCRIPT FOR A MOVIE. I'VE BEEN OUT THERE TALKING I HAVE NO CONNECTIONS TO ANYONE AT "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE," OTHER THAN OMAROSA. IN FACT, SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE DESPERATE SITUATION. I REALLY DO FEEL SORRY FOR HER. I WAS REALLY CONCERNED WITH OMAROSA WHEN SHE GOT MARRIED, WHEN SHE HAD TO BUY A FAKE BUT I WILL NOT STAND BY AND ALLOW HER TO CONTINUE TO TARNISH Ed: WE GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND. I WANT TO GET TO THE NEW INFORMATION BUT FIRST, I WANT TO BE CLEAR, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THE PRESIDENT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, SINCE THE CAMPAIGN, SINCE HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD HIM USE THE N-WORD, ANY SORT OF RACIAL SLUR? ABSOLUTELY NOT. THE ANSWER IS NO. IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT KIND, GENEROUS, AND RESPECTFUL TO MYSELF AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT I KNOW OF COLOR OF COLOR. DEVELOPMENT, LONGTIME TRUMP ADVISOR, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT. I UNDERSTAND SHE'S PUTTING OUT A STATEMENT THIS HOUR THAT IS REFUTING THESE CLAIMS. CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? AS I MENTIONED, OMAROSA WAS THE SOURCE OF THIS TAPE, SHE WAS CAMPAIGN. IN MY OPINION, AS A TOOL OF MANIPULATION OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HER. SHE HAS BEEN MENTIONING LYNNE INTERVIEWS AS SOMEONE WHO COULD HAS RELEASED A STATEMENT THIS EVENING AND SHE HAS GIVEN AN IT'S RUNNING IN MORE IMPORTANTLY, ED, IT'S THE TIMELINE. THE REASON WHY OMAROSA IS FACING A RAPID CONTRADICTIONS IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP HER LICENSE STRAIGHT. SHE'S GOT OUT THERE AND SAID THAT SHE HAS NOT HEARD THE TAPES UNTIL HER BOOK WAS FINALIZED. WHATEVER HE WANTED IT NOW AND WHAT LYNNE PATTON IS ANNOUNCING TONIGHT Ed: THAT IS LYNNE PATTON RIGHT THERE. JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. A PHONE CALL SHE SAYS, OMAROSA TOLD HER THEN THAT SHE HAD HEARD THE TAPE WHERE THE PRESIDENT ALLEGEDLY SAID THE N-WORD. SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE NOW IN RECENT DAYS, OMAROSA HAS SAID THAT SHE HAS NOT HEARD IT UNTIL AFTER WRITING HER BOOK. DECEMBER 12, 2017, SHE HADN'T WRITTEN THE BOOK AND SHE WAS STILL IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS OF A CONTRADICTION. IS THAT WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS TONIGHT? IT'S A MAJOR CONTRADICTION. IT'S A BOMBSHELL, LYNNE PATTON. TWO DAYS AFTER THAT, SHE WENT ON ABC NEWS INTERVIEW DEFENDING A PRESIDENT, SAYING, "THAT HE IS NOT A RACIST." SO HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE IF SHE HEARD THE TAPE ALREADY, THAT SHE WAS USING AS THEIR EXCUSE TO Ed: ANOTHER QUICK POINT I WANT TO MAKE. MARK BURNETT, TOP ONE OF THE CREATORS OF "THE APPRENTICE," EXISTS. BILL PRUITT, ANOTHER PRODUCER ON "THE APPRENTICE" IS CORROBORATING HER STORY. BILL PRUITT WAS THE PRODUCER OF SEASONS ONE AND TWO, WHERE SHE IS CLAIMING THAT THIS APPARENTLY TOOK PLACE. SHE ALSO TOLD LYNNE PATTON THAT BILL PRUITT WAS HER ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE TAPE, AND LYNNE PATTON SPOKE WITH BILL THIS EVENING AND IS ANNOUNCING THAT THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE AND AS I SUSPECTED, ALL ALONG, THIS TAPE DOES NOT EXIST. OMAROSA EXTRAS DESPERATE FOR MONEY FOR MONEY. Ed: ALL RIGHT. LAST QUESTION. YOU ARE AT HER WEDDING. THERE ARE PHOTOS OF YOU ONLINE HAVING FUN WITH OMAROSA. I KNOW PEOPLE, FRIENDS, THEY BREAK UP, THE PRESIDENT HIRED TAXPAYER MONEY INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT AND THE CAMPAIGNS THAT HE WAS GOING TO HIRE THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST, THAT HE WAS A BUSINESS NAME, THERE YOU ARE AT THE WEDDING. HE'S HAD PROBLEMS NOW WITH MICHAEL COHEN AS WELL. STATING THE FACT BRAIDS BE WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT HER RING I DID FEEL SORRY FOR HER. Ed: YOU SAID IT WAS TRASH FOR CASH. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. YOU'VE BEEN FRIENDS WITH HER AND THE PRESIDENT HIRED HER TO A SENSITIVE WHITE HOUSE POST, BEING PAID ALMOST $200,000 A YEAR IN TAXPAYER MONEY. MAKE BRADY SIMPLY GAVE AN INDIVIDUAL AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN OUT THERE CHAMPION HERE COMMUNITIES WITH A PRISONER FORMAT EVERYTHING THAT BUT PRESIDENT IS DOING FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY BUT SHE CHOSE TO
