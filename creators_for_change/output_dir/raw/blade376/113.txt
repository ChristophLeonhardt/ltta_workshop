00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,019
fascinate me in life well for one is

00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,150
contrast the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> two juxtaposing</font>

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,250
items can actually complement each other

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,139
I mean it's why I'm usually seen only

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,420
wearing black and<font color="#E5E5E5"> white number two human</font>

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,280
nature that traditional notion that

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,170
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly having internal battles</font>

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,000
between good and evil number three

struggle how what doesn't kill us makes

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,039
us stronger number for inspiration the

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,750
fact that every person on this planet

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,939
has a skill or experience that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,590
a truly awesome storytelling method why

23
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,090
did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that whatever's wrong with</font>

24
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,530
was it an accident in true nature since

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,570
I started making<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos on youtube I</font>

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,430
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been constantly contacted by</font>

27
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,140
companies who wish for me to work on

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,120
projects with them and to be honest I

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,369
turned a loss of them down why you ask

30
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just didn't connect with the</font>

31
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,170
projects that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they threw my way however</font>

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,000
I was approached by the makers of a

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,770
movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> called Chronicle which comes out</font>

34
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,590
in February first 2012 and they had a

35
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,390
concept which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought could be really</font>

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,580
inspiring the movie is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a group of</font>

37
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">friends who developed superpowers and as</font>

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,509

<font color="#CCCCCC">to help the world and the truth is so so</font>

79
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,959
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about acknowledging your</font>

80
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,850
skills regardless of how small or

81
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,860
trivial they may seem and then applying

82
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,600
them in a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can really help</font>

83

others let's say you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good at</font>

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,350
making sandwiches sounds trivial I know

85
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,600
but apply that skill and with the food

86
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,430
that you've created give it to some

87
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,049
homeless people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the street and there</font>

88
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:47,060
you have it you're a real life superhero

89

if you're capable of<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling a joke</font>

90
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,570
which can make others laugh and smile

91
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,640
then tell us it if you're capable of

92
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,739
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trick then teach us if you're</font>

94
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,250
capable of giving words of advice then

95
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,810
upload it as a video response the

96
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,150
possibilities are<font color="#E5E5E5"> endless for this the</font>

97
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,890
