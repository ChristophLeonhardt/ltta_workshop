fire ship now it's sick
I'm digging this one is it dog brings me
back
but sounds like something I used to put
on dim lock back in like oh three times
no shirt on long hair fly cuts all over
his chest from scratching himself from
going crazy on stage black lips black
lips though
it's on the tip of my tongue that voice
is still recognizable to okay this is a
girl it's a girl definitely something
you use a rom-com
it's a fart in the wrong car where you
start smiling you're happy happy vibes
blondie blondie
Wow how could how did I not know that
Deborah Harry's voice the wavy line up
on the Sun crazy chance plays Oh beaver
Lil Wayne count on a roll man he just
doesn't stop he's every hit he's got to
hit doctor back-to-back unstoppable
long before be
definitely got this accent that I can't
place misterwives misterwives never her
them or they from New York from New York
 help you a gun you've got a lot to
discuss in the headed by thinking
far can we hear this you're like
something is bursting out of you you
know it's like it's definitely the whole
email core era comes back to me you know
when I listen to his lyrics and the way
that mics flowing and he's building this
tension and Chester comes in sources
vocals out I love like a park ground
