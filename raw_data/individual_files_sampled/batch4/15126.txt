most people know Las Vegas is a dangerous place for your wallet but last October the gambling capital became notorious for a different reason after the Mandalay Bay massacre and there was another Vegas shooting recently no one was killed but a professor was shot by himself reportedly to protest President Trump let's take a look mark bird is a 69 year old sociology professor at the College of Southern Nevada now's the time when I typically show a picture of him but here's the thing apart from a rather middling rape my professors page bird seems to have little to no online presence well before this week that is when it came out that bird has been charged with carrying a dangerous weapon at school and without a permit as well as shooting the weapon inside a restricted environment bird who had taught at the College of Southern Nevada for 25 years apparently taped a $100 bill to a mirror in a campus bathroom with a note reading for the janitor and then shot himself in the arm with a 22 caliber pistol campus employees and one or more students saw him limping out of the bathroom someone called 911 said that before the police arrived the professor said he shot himself to protest Trump Byrd will have a preliminary hearing on September 17th now I don't get too many stories out of Nevada to be honest but another one that did come to mind was University of Nevada Las Vegas history professor Tessa Winkleman who warned her students that people will die because of Trump be affected by this birth didn't mean the others are going to talk I don't know but he has and rhetorical powers every person discouraged right so far all it's done is just for some context Tesla made those remarks a few days after the Las Vegas massacre maybe the FBI and CIA should have interviewed her about the shooting she seems to know something they don't or of course she's using a tragedy to further her own political agenda that's also a possibility as for professor bird this time it seems to have been an anti-trump professor taking his anguish out on himself but who's to stop a leftist professor from channeling their hysteria onto an innocent student per campus unmasked I'm Rob chin shock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm you
