last week the Pennsylvania Supreme Court called for new congressional districts to be drawn up because right now the congressional districts they have are purposefully designed to over overly help Republicans in comparison to the share of the vote that they get it's one of the worst examples of congressional gerrymandering that we have and so now those new districts need to be drawn up and the court is giving lawmakers and the Democratic Governor Tom wolf until February 15th to come up with a new map if they can't agree on one by then the court has appointed a special master to get one in place so the state's scheduled election primaries can run smoothly but there was another step to it actually to help them create those new districts four days after its initial order On January 26 the court issued a subsequent order requiring that the legislature turn over certain data including geolocation files that contain the current boundaries of all Pennsylvania municipalities and precincts and blah blah blah basically information that you need so that you can create those new districts and so that those new districts you create are actually more fair and actually represent a community rather than a computer crafted way to give as many Republican Congressmen as you possibly can now that all sounds good but unfortunately the Republicans in the state have listened and they heard a Supreme Court wants us to do that they've they've decided no we're simply not going to do that and so the lead Republican in the state Senate is fighting back against this and put out statements saying in light of the unconstitutionality of the courts orders and the courts plain intent to usurp the General Assembly's constitutionally delegated role of drafting Pennsylvania's congressional district plan senators car not ii will not be turning over any data identified in the courts orders and so this is one of two ways that they're attempting to destroy this effort to unjam and er pennsylvania or at least delay it so that it can't go into effect for this year's elections the other is a more traditional way and it's a way that Republicans in other states that have had this same sort of change are fighting against it last week's garnet he sought a stay of the January 22nd order from the Supreme court claiming that only the state legislature and not the state courts are constitutionally allowed to weigh in on questions of gerrymandering which I mean look I'm an American I pay attention and I also taught political science courses I understand a little bit about the the distribution of power between branches of government that's not how it works buddy but that's what they're gonna try to do so the very first thing you learn in law school is Marbury vs. Madison so that's where the Supreme Court laid down the law if you will and and establish the precedent that the court gets to decide what is constitutional unconstitutional we've been following that for well over 200 years in this country and there's a great reason for that and and know that what it does is it creates stability and you know how the different powers apportion within the different branches of the government what the Republicans are doing is dangerous on a lot of fronts so a Trump is attacking the rule of law at the federal levels saying don't believe that FBI let's some of the his supporters are going on TV saying we should not only fire people at the FBI we started resting them and putting them in prison if they don't agree with us now at the local level we've got Republicans saying Marbury v Madison be damned our separation of powers and our Constitution be damned and let's just have lawlessness because if the legislature won't listen to the courts well then how do we decide anything how do we know who's right well you've totally trashed the rule of law so don't please don't pretend you for the rule law because it if you're a Republican they say an age and if you are done don't vote for guys like this because they they don't represent you so I think that the courts have to reassert their authority here otherwise we're gonna have lawlessness yeah now I want you to understand the context here so Republican says hey I think this is more of a political matter that's a fine debate and that's why you take it to court and you argue in court that this should be something that's decided by the legislature but you have to let the Court decide and if they rule against you you have to follow their rules so he says no I don't - I don't care if the court rules for me great then I win if the court rules against me I just ignore the court well then we're not a country of laws anymore so and the court didn't say I'm now going to make all these places weirdly gerrymandered in favor of the Democrats of course not the court said that you cannot divide any County City incorporated town borough Township or ward except where necessary to ensure equality of population in other words they're saying and by the way that might not be to the Democrats advantage in in Pennsylvania the Democrats are concentrated in big cities like Pittsburgh and Philly so the courts not telling you oh yeah well get the Republicans then we'll withdraw the districts like this to give the Democrats in advance right now they're drawn up in a preposterous way that have nothing to do with whether which city you live in which county you live in and that's why even though the majority of people in Pennsylvania voted for Democrats for the house the Republicans have thirteen out of the 18 seats there's something greatly undemocratic about that and the pencil and this is not a national issue this is strictly a Pennsylvania issue and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled it should be over so when when he does not look they don't need his cooperation 100% they could get the data from other people and they've already put in a process and they will draw their lines etc but I think that they need to enforce precedent here yeah and they should hold them in contempt of court and if he does not give what the court has ordered they should lock him up yeah because if it we're gonna have lawlessness if all of a sudden all across the country Republicans go if I went and great if I lose I ignore it then we have madness and that's not our system we have a constitutional system you must listen to the courts yeah I'm not kidding and it's me and I don't know maybe if he gets threat of actually being put in jail he might wise it up go write write a constitution forgot to read it right I'm supposed to listen to the courts yeah yeah I mean imagine if imagine if the house in the Senate national you start doing this yeah says it but how many legions does the Supreme Court have I mean this is when we were afraid about what Trump and you know that his enablers would represent in the that we thought you this this is how democracies fail this is how we backside this is how you get an authoritarian state it doesn't necessarily just happen with one big thing it can happen with the destruction of norms over time not respecting Supreme Court's destroying the FBI all these sorts of things allowing obstruction of justice to become just an expected thing I mean that adds up over time and you have to check it wherever possible this is certainly a place to do that what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you can get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
