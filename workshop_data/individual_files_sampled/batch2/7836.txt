we've got mark Williams in the studio right here he's run Colorado's second District great to have you here mark pleasure to be here Jake all right so let's break down your race are you the progressive candidate in the race are we sure about that well I mean you know there's progressives and then there's a fog recives right and the district down from which is Colorado second we have you know it's one of the most progressive districts in the country probably you know it's got Boulder it's got Fort Collins it's gerrymandered solid blue and it's gonna go progressive right and so you start seeing the positions of the different candidates you go well both are progressives but then you start peeling the onion back and you go who's the one that's not taking money from PACs special interests or lobbyists or DC insiders right who's the one that's standing strong against fracking and against extraction right and then who's the who's the person who's saying enough of the wars and let's get out of Afghanistan and in my mind in a district like ours that's what progressives all about okay that's you right that yep and I stopped my check that was me okay so solidly blue so the Democratic Party should stay out of it what difference does it make in fact if they were real progressives they were back there more progressive candidate because you're gonna win no matter what in the general election so why not get someone as progressive as possible so I assume they poured a lot of money into your campaign to support you right well I've just you know tons and tons of money and I didn't know what to do with it all so I just said take it back Steny do something else with it and maybe give it to the other guy and that's actually what's happened you know I mean it looks a lot like what happened in Colorado 6 where you know Levi's got pushed out and so on and so forth and and the race broke down the same and you know one of the unique things about our district is it's you know there's a little civil war or maybe a big civil war brooming in the Democratic Party and we are the frontlines of that because you can't say oh my goodness well if if if if we don't have a centrist here right we're not gonna win this race that's absolute rubbish and they got involved here just like they did in the six and the fact of the matter it's it's a dumb you know if the Democrats gonna win and so this district went basically 70/30 Bernie Wow so you know riddle me that Riddler why can't we have the right representation here and by the way just so you know Mark's opponent is not an incumbent because that would be another excuse but jared Polis 10 coming is going to run for governor so it's an open seat so how do you know if the Democratic Party establishment is supporting your opponent well you know here's what it looks like so the day after Jared announces for governor you know my opponents website pops within 2-3 days probably 60 65 % of the elected folks in the district have endorsed him pretty quick he's getting money from a mare Pakistani lawyers group and then all the other packs that are flush and money out of DC he gets flown out by the d-triple-c dove the same thing in Williamsburg that all the other anointed candidates get to and then you know we were putting our campaign team together and as I started talking to folks they would hear about my campaign and go that sounds really good you're like the progressive in the race and then all of a sudden they'd go dark and I found out later they were basically saying you work on the Williams campaign you'll never work again Colorado politics and there's just no excuse for it so that leaves you with basically your only option is that they're doing it because they're in favor of the corruption they don't want people to come in and and not take a corporate PAC money and not use their lobbyists and not use their consultants etc cos just look yesterday Kerr Eastman who's just Democrat doesn't take corporate PAC money won in Nebraska against the corporate friendly conservative Democrat Brad Ashford who was it US congressman in Washington they were saying that's an own-goal meaning that the Democrats shot themselves in the foot now I think that's absolutely wrong and I think a populist progressive is a way better chance of winning in Nebraska but that's Nebraska you've got no excuse in the most democratic district to me in the country yeah and you know it's Boulder Colorado and you know what they've done is line up you know oil and gas they've lined up all the typical lawyer PACs and lobbyists and so you know my opponents taking money from all the oil and gas interest and they have a lot of stroke in Colorado and then he's taking money from you know Steny and his groups and then taking money from folks like you know Brownstein the second biggest lobbying firm in the country if you if you googled norm Brownstein you'll see a picture of him with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia you know so he's arguing to make sure American arms get delivered to Saudi Arabia so they can fight Yemen and continue the refugee crisis and I say in my district that's not progressive I mean we are a place where you can have an anti-war candidate a candidate that stands for stopping and banning fracking and a candidate that says no pact special interest lobbyists or insiders and that's where I'm coming from so and I want the audience to understand that in some of these races and Democratic primaries it doesn't mean that your opponent is terrible person it doesn't mean that they are wrong on all of the issues no but if someone's taking money from all the people that you just mentioned I I can't trust them that maybe they're a good person and maybe they'll be progressive on some of the issues but that's not good enough especially in a deeply blue district it's just no reason to settle for that no exactly and so you know the my opponents a great guy nice guy you know and that's what everybody says he's a really nice guy but my problem is it's like you took money from a corporate PAC that corporate PAC lobbied Hickenlooper against signing the high-capacity magazine ban after the Aurora shooting first of all why would you take that money I mean count me out for it right and I think you need to have more political imagination and go I'm gonna stand strong against this because that's not what progressive values are all about so how can you vote against the NRA and all that kind of stuff when you're taking that kind of money and by the way you know they fund Republicans as much as they do Democrats if you look at who they give money to they're feeding both sides and that's the problem as you know exactly so by the way we'll have the links to help Marc's campaign in description down below in YouTube and Facebook and and let's put them up it's mark for Colorado comm is the website so you just jump on there and obviously donations and volunteers are really really important for campaigns that are not taking corporate back money mark now you got me a you and Levi's got me on pins and needles for the Colorado primary I can't wait to see what's gonna happen there June 26 is that primary and so folks who are in true State in Colorado who live in Colorado that's the data remember June 26 because after that it's all decided certainly in my district because whoever wins that it's gerrymander blue that's gonna be your congressperson so you've got a lot of union experience you were a chair of the Boulder County Democrats you're in the US Air Force and you did what data and technology there is that right yeah I've been in the startup world but in the military I flew for the airlines for a while I was a you know fighter pilot in the Air Force and one of my previous lives so yeah I've been here and there as it were and now but I want to ask about your issue so your progressive down the line you know Medicare for all no corporate PAC et cetera but you got two things on here that stand out one is guard public lands yeah what do you mean by that well you know I mean everybody thinks Colorado and they think the Rocky Mountains right and so you the the beauty the rock you man or the Rocky Mountains of splitting the Rocky Mountains Rocky Mountain National Park etc but if you start seeing what's happening in terms of extraction there with oil and gas and fracking up and down the Front Range and then even on the west side of Colorado it's just ripping the land up you know not to even mention the climate change stuff so between one thing in the next you say you know in Colorado we need to stand strong against the oil and gas because it's devastating our public lands and the the amount of you know the amount that extraction is going after that kind of thing it's just it's ruining what's what what Colorado is all about and then the other things related which is you've got stop fracking in Boulder County why or is there fracking going on and Boulder one of the most liberal place in the country right exactly there is yeah I mean you know so the bulldozers are quite literally at the county line and you know they're fighting it out in our governor Hickenlooper of course he's on the side of oil and gas and you know there's been a lot of shenanigans and oil and gas in Colorado politics and so the bulldozers are quite literally there and folks are rising up and fighting against it and you know that is the that is where all the activists are coming together because that's Ground Zero and the way that we see it is if we stop fracking here that starts that basically puts the flag in the ground and that's how we start changing this conversation about accelerating to renewables so mark let's dive into your strategy so you're right on the issues and and the Democratic Party's against you so I'm on your side okay so the establishment doesn't want you that must mean you're uncorrupted but so how are you going to win so talk to me about I'm sure that you know you've got limited resources compared to the guy with getting all the PAC money yeah how are you going to deploy those what are you gonna use them on yeah I'll try to get this victory no it's a great question we're gonna be outspent 10x and you know so with my background in the startup world I've got a lot of folks that have come on board that are you know best-in-class in terms of their abilities for social media and all that kind of stuff so we're leveraging all that I also did a bunch of work in streaming video and so we've got a lot of great video content you know but most importantly your two things first is ideas you know we've got the right ideas for this district because like I said 70/30 Bernie and secondly is we've got a just kick-ass group of volunteers and these people are motivated they're they're on the ground they're making a difference and it's like yeah we're gonna get outspent but you know what the bigger the ideas how motivated and how pumped we are and if we turn out the Bernie vote we take this puppy this is a way winnable thing all right everybody Marc Williams second District of Colorado might soon be congressman Williams so Marc thank you for joining thank you James I appreciate it
