1
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,056
>> Laura: THE ANTI-TRUMP

2
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:15,627
KAVANAUGH RESISTANCE LOOKS LIKE

3
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:18,863
A PROGRESSIVE MENTAL DISORDER.

4
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:22,367
POST KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION

5
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:24,235
SYNDROME.

6
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:27,272
FIRST, LINDA SARSOUR CONDUCTED

7
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:30,041
THE FIRST CONFIRMATION SERIES,

8
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:32,944
AND THEN BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS

9
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,112
ACCUSED OF RAPE, THEN FLASHING

10
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:37,348
HIS PRIVATE PARTS.

11
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:39,717
THEN ACCUSED BASICALLY OF GANG

12
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:41,286
RAPE.

13
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,922
THEN RADICALS CORNERED JEFF

14
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:46,024
FLAKE IN AN ELEVATOR AND THEN,

15
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:47,725
KAVANAUGH WAS ACCUSED OF

16
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:48,927
BASICALLY BEING AN ALCOHOLIC,

17
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:50,328
AND HAVING ANGER ISSUES, AND

18
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,964
WHEN ALL THAT FAILED, A MOB OF

19
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,999
CRAZY EYED PROTESTERS SMASHED

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,537
AND CLAWED AT THE SUPREME COURT

21
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:03,341
DOORS AND WAIVED FILTHY SIGNS.

22
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:04,943
DEMOCRATS PROMISED IMPEACHMENT

23
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:06,544
AND TO ABANDON THE ELECTORAL

24
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:07,946
COLLEGE, FINALLY TO PACK THE

25
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:10,148
COURT TO OFFSET THE FIVE

26
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:11,182
CONSERVATIVES ON THE BENCH.

27
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:14,152
JOINING US NOW WITH REACTION TO

28
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,286
THIS TRAGIC DISORDER, VICTOR

29
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:23,695
DAVIS HANSON, AUTHOR OF THE BOO

30
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:25,330
BOOK, YOU'VE HEARD OF

31
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:26,064
INFLAMMATORY BALL DISEASE, THIS

32
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,633
IS AN INFLAMMATORY

33
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:32,770
ANTI-KAVANAUGH TRUMP MADNESS.

34
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:37,375
HAVE THEY EVER BEEN THIS FAR

35
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:41,346
LEFT OR THIS MUCH UNHINGED?

36
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:43,114
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

37
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:45,383
I THINK YOU CAN TRACE IT FROM

38
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:47,118
2009 THROUGH 16 WHEN OBAMA

39
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,320
PROMISED THEM THAT A NEW

40
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:50,388
DEMOGRAPHY, IMMIGRATION AND

41
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:54,993
IDENTITY POLITICS, THE SYSTEM

42
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:59,397
WAS GEARED FOR THAT.

43
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:03,701
THE HOUSE AND SENATE, AND OUT OF

44
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:05,536
THAT FRUSTRATION, THEY THINK BIG

45
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:05,837
MONEY.

46
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:09,741
AT THE PARTY OF THE RICH NOW,

47
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:10,741
SILICON VALLEY, WALL STREET,

48
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:14,178
MAYBE THEY WILL LIKE THAT

49
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:19,083
SPECTACLE.

50
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:25,623
AND, MOB THEM, SHOUT THEM DOWN,

51
00:02:25,624 --> 00:02:28,359
GET RID OF DUE PROCESS.

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,727
THEY ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE

53
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,163
SYSTEM THAT USED TO BE GREAT

54
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,565
BETWEEN 2009 AT 16, AND SUDDENLY

55
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:38,302
IS ANTIDEMOCRATIC.

56
00:02:38,303 --> 00:02:40,405
NONE FROM WYOMING, THERE ARE TOO

57
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:43,274
FEW PEOPLE THERE.

58
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:47,912
LET'S GO BACK TO 1869 BEFORE WE

59
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:48,813
HAD ADDITIONAL NUMBERS OF

60
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:54,118
SUPREME COURT JUDGES.

61
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,753
IT'S KIND OF A NICHE AND DESIRE

62
00:02:55,754 --> 00:03:00,191
FOR POWER, AND A LOT OF THESE

63
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:00,892
DILEMMAS WERE SELF-INFLICTED.

64
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:02,360
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO WERE

65
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,662
TURNED OFF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND

66
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:07,065
INDEPENDENCE, THE WHITE WORKING

67
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:11,369
CLASS AND THE SWING STATES.

68
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,705
>> Laura: SO WHAT ARE THEY

69
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:20,912
BANKING ON?

70
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:23,815
, SHE WAS ASKED ON MSNBC, WHAT

71
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,450
ARE YOU GOING TO DO BASICALLY

72
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:29,987
ONCE YOU GET ELECTED?

73
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:34,358
IT'S REALLY ABOUT ORGANIZING AND

74
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,095
REALLY THINKING ABOUT THAT WORD,

75
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:38,096
ORGANIZING.

76
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:41,165
BEING STRATEGIC IN THEIR ACTION

77
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,366
ACTIONS, AND REALLY BRINGING

78
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,736
TOGETHER A COHESIVE STRATEGY OF

79
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:45,870
PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE CHAMBER

80
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:47,739
INSTEAD OF ONLY FOCUSING ON THE

81
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,974
PRESSURE IS INSIDE THE CHAMBER.

82
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:51,142
>> THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING.

83
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:55,880
>> MY FAVORITE AREAS, THAT'S A

84
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,682
REALLY INTERESTING THOUGHT.

85
00:03:57,683 --> 00:04:00,318
>> WHILE I DON'T KNOW.

86
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,352
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CRITICIZED

87
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:02,720
DONALD TRUMP AND SAID HE HAS THE

88
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:06,324
VOCABULARY OF 1500 WORDS, BUT

89
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:09,360
HE'S A SOPHISTICATED ARTICULATE.

90
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,529
BUT THIS IS BOSTON UNIVERSITY,

91
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,432
WHAT, FOURTH IN THE CLASS.

92
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:18,102
AND THEY START JUDGING PEOPLE BY

93
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:20,238
THEIR ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR THEIR

94
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,143
IDEOLOGY, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU

95
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:25,877
GET IT.

96
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:26,911
IT'S KIND OF SAD THAT THE

97
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:32,550
DEMOCRATS WERE GOING DOWN.

98
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:35,153
THEY OCTOGENARIANS, FEINSTEIN,

99
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:36,187
BIDEN AND PELOSI, THEY ARE SO

100
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:39,690
DESPERATE TO BE HIP AND GET BACK

101
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:42,360
TO PARTIES, AND IS SAYING HE'S

102
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:43,461
GOING TO BEAT TRUMP UP OUTSIDE

103
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:45,496
OF THE LOCKER ROOM OR SOMETHING

104
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:46,697
OR FEINSTEIN HAS THIS BUSY TEAM

105
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:50,701
SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH  K

106
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:50,735
SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH  V

107
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:50,768
SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH  N

108
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:50,802
SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH  U

109
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:51,035
SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE CAVANAUGH  H

110
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:52,703
WITH THE TESTIMONY.

111
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:53,371
IT'S PATHETIC THAT SOMEONE

112
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:54,071
HIJACKED THEIR PARTY AND THEY

113
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:56,340
ARE KIND OF DEER IN HEADLIGHTS.

114
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:57,375
THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO BE

115
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,943
HIP AND GO HARD LEFT OR SUFFER

116
00:04:58,944 --> 00:04:59,844
THE IRRELEVANCE OF BEING OLD AND

117
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:02,947
IN THE WAY.

118
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:07,285
>> Laura: WHEN I WAS AT THE

119
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:10,788
WHITE HOUSE, AND, IT'S PROBABLY

120
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,258
A PRETTY DECENT ONE.

121
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:20,131
OBVIOUSLY, THEY HAD ANOTHER

122
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,233
SUPPORT OPENING.

123
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:26,938
BUSH STAFF SECRETARY  , AND VERY

124
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:27,338
MAINSTREAM.

125
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:32,910
PERSON AND IT JUDGE.

126
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:36,781
SO CAN YOU IMAGINE IF RUTH

127
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:40,551
BADER GINSBURG IS SUDDENLY OPEN,

128
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:44,355
AND WHAT WILL THEY DO THEN?

129
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:45,189
BILL MARR AS SAYING THAT THE

130
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,490
PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE A RIGHT

131
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:50,494
TO APPOINT ANYONE ELSE.

132
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:55,466
>> I THINK BY NOMINATING

133
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:58,336
KAVANAUGH FIRST, HE SAID IF YOU

134
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,737
WERE WITH BUSH, YOU WENT TO THE

135
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,906
RIGHT SCHOOLS AND YOU COULD BE

136
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:04,542
CARICATURED AS A PREPPY.

137
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,944
JUST THINK WHAT THEY WILL DO TO

138
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:09,313
THE NEXT THAT IS IN FURTHER TO

139
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:09,947
THE RIGHT?

140
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:11,816
AND WHEN SHE IS NOMINATED, HE

141
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:14,352
CAN JUST SAY LOOK.

142
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:22,627
IT'S NOT HER, NOT ANYBODY.

143
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:28,399
AND IT'S 90% OF THAT SMALL

144
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,003
RUBRIC, AND I WILL TAKE

145
00:06:32,004 --> 00:00:00,000
DONALD TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN.
