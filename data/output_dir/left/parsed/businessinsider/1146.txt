you want to keep carpet out of the
bathroom you want to keep it dry as best
as possible using the Clorox wipes or
whatever type of antiseptic or Lysol
wipes to kill mold spores and mildew
whence a month you should scrub down
your shower curtain with some kind of
disinfectant I would say at least every
six months you should throw it out

spores can accumulate death mat should
be changed either every six months or
every year certain bath mats are
washable and that's another thing that
if you can wash it put it in the dryer
to kill the dust mite the whole thing
with a house is to try to keep it as dry
as possible and ventilated as best as
possible damn spaces create areas where
mildew dust bite accumulate
