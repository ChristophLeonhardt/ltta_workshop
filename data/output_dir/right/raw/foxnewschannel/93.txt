KAVANAUGH.

21
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:48,129
>> TRADITIONALLY IN WITCHCRAFT

22
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,731
MOST OF PEOPLE DON'T SHARE THE

23
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:53,434
EXACT TOOL.

24
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:56,370
JESSE: CAN YOU GIVE ME A HINT.

25
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:01,809
>> EFFIGIES, OPEN FLAMES, THE

26
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,210
WHOLE BIT.

27
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:07,048
JESSE: WILL AN EFFIGY OF

28
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,350
KAVANAUGH BE BURNED BY THE

29
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:09,684
WITCHES?

30
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:10,351
>> YES.

31
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:12,453
JESSE: WHAT WILL YOU BE DOING

32
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:14,088
WITH THE GRAVEYARD DIRT?

33
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:18,459
>> WHEN YOU TAKE A JAR, SIGHT

34
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,895
AND BURN CANDLES ON IT AND IT'S

35
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,931
A CONTINUING SPELL.

36
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:28,002
JESSE: IS THERE A CAULDRON

37
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:28,736
INVOLVED?

38
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:33,174
>> YES, THAT'S WHERE THE FIRE

39
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:34,208
WILL BE.

40
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:35,276
>> YEAH.

41
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:38,045
JESSE: HAVE THE HEXES WORKED IN

42
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:38,613
THE PAST?

43
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:40,047
>> YES.

44
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:43,751
WE HEXED TRUMPS LAST SUMMER.

45
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:45,953
THERE WAS ONE IN JUNE, ONE IN

46
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,688
JULY AND ONE IN AUGUST.

47
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,191
SINCE THEN A LOT HAS COME OUT.

48
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:51,292
THE HEX.

49
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:54,162
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE IT AS

50
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:56,130
HEXING IS TO MAKE THAT PERSON

51
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:59,233
DIE AND DO SOMETHING HORRIBLE TO

52
00:01:59,234 --> 00:01:59,534
THEM.

53
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:00,902
IT DEPEND ON WHAT YOU ARE TRYING

54
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:01,969
TO DO.

55
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,038
THE WORDING AND THE INTENTION.

56
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,374
FOR US IT'S ABOUT EXPOSING THESE

57
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,109
PEOPLE.

58
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,077
WE BELIEVE THEY ARE

59
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:11,846
FUNDAMENTALLY DISHONEST AND

60
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:12,413
UNETHICAL.

61
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:16,384
SO WE WANT THAT TO BE EXPOSED.

62
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:18,352
JESSE: PERHAPS THE TRUMP HEX

63
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:19,787
DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE THE

64
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:21,556
PRESIDENT IS WING OVER AND OVER

65
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:21,856
AGAIN.

66
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:25,960
>> THAT DEPEND ON HOW YOU DEFINE

67
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:26,294
WINNING.

68
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:28,396
ON OUR SIDE OF THINGS WE FEEL

69
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:30,464
SINCE LAST SUMMER WE HAVE THE

70
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:35,570
RUSSIA PROBE WHICH HAS LED TO

71
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:38,706
HOW MANY CONVICTIONS DOES IT

72
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:39,173
TAKE.

73
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:41,142
JESSE: YOU BELIEVE THE HEX ON

74
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:41,909
TRUMP WORKED.

75
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,512
NOW YOU WILL BE HEXING BRETT

76
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:45,413
KAVANAUGH AS WELL.

77
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:50,051
ARE YOU A PEACEFUL WITCH?

78
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:51,919
AN EVIL WITCH?

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,422
>> I DON'T ASCRIBE EITHER TO

80
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:55,756
MYSELF BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

81
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:58,593
ANYTHING IN OUR UNIVERSE OR

82
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:01,028
WORLD IS CUT AND DRY AS GOOD AND

83
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:01,596
EVIL.

84
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:04,232
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE

85
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,499
FUNDAMENTALLY GOOD OR EVIL.

86
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,069
JESSE: EXCUSE ME,.

87
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,770
"WATTERS' WORLD" IS GOOD.

88
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,273
>> BUT THAT DEPEND ON YOUR

89
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:14,108
DEFINITION OF GOOD.

90
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:15,710
EVERY RELIGION IN THE WORLD

91
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:16,944
WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT

92
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:18,346
DEFINITION FOR WHAT THE RIGHT

93
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:19,247
ACTION WOULD BE.

94
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:23,951
THERE IS SOME GENERAL SET MOST

95
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:26,287
OF OF THEM ADHERE TO.

96
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:30,258
BUT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN

97
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,359
DEFINITION OF MORAL ACTION.

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,229
JESSE: DO YOU BELIEVE THE

99
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,498
WITCHCRAFT MAKES THE LEFT AND

100
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:40,534
ANTI-TRUMP AND ANTI-KAVANAUGH

101
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,203
PEOPLE LOOK A LITTLE SILLY?

102
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:46,007
>> I WOULDN'T MIND IF IT DID.

103
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,409
ONE THING I HOPE WE GET TO

104
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,610
DISCUSS BETWEEN US.

105
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:51,946
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT.

106
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:53,814
IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE LEFT.

107
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:57,385
JESSE: YOU SHOULD CAST A SPELL

108
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:58,052
ON HILLARY CLINTON.

109
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:00,588
SHE HAS ALREADY BEEN CURSED.

110
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:02,089
WHAT ABOUT NANCY PELOSI?

111
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,891
>> I'M NOT ABOUT KICKING

112
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:05,826
SOMEBODY WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY

113
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:06,127
DOWN.

114
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:07,728
JESSE: ISN'T THAT WHAT ERIC

115
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:08,696
HOLDER WANTS TO DO?

116
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:11,699
>> I FEEL LIKE HILLARY ISN'T

117
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,671
DOING TOO WELL.

118
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,540
JESSE: YOU ARE A BERNIE BRO,

119
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:19,940
AREN'T YOU?

120
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,443
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

121
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:24,445
I LIKE A LOT OF WHAT BERNIE HAS

122
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:25,513
TO SAY.

123
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:26,914
I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE

124
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:27,715
HAS TO SAY.

125
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:29,817
I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS HE'LL

126
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:33,187
SORT OF ESPOUSE HARD LEFTIST

127
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:35,923
RHETORIC AND THEN IN PRACTICE

128
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:39,593
DOESN'T CARRY THROUGH WITH IT.

129
00:04:39,594 --> 00:00:00,000
JESSE: DAKOTA, THANK YOU VERY
