welcome everyone I'm Alicia Kraus with The Daily wire we're talking with Liz wheeler she's the host of tipping point on one American news Liz thanks so much for being here Alisha thanks for having me it's great to be here of course love having you so there's lots of stories happening this week let's jump right into it first we have NFL owners unanimously passing a new rule that requires that players who choose to be on the field for the national anthem stand and respect the flag vice-president pence says that this is another hashtag winning moment for conservatives do you agree with that I don't know if it's a win for conservatives here I personally and I know this is really controversial I personally have no problem with private entities saying how they want their employees to behave while their employees are at the workplace let's remember the NFL is an employer and the NFL players are employees I mean if you and I walked into our workplace got on air and yelled we hate America or something obscene we would be told that that is not appropriate behavior and we would be censured for that I think it's appropriate if the NFL wants to do that to set that to set that parameter I think also all the teams voted unanimously right this wasn't even controversial within the what is it 12 NFL teams yeah and I think maybe that's because they saw their ratings taking a helmet after this whole stunt last year so we'll see what the season looks like and if they can get those ratings up some teams I think including the Buffalo Bills and maybe even the New York Jets have said that not only do their guys need to do this but they are also requiring them to be on the field for the national anthem so it'll be interesting great if any other teams make that decision as well but moving on unfortunately last week there's another horrific school shooting this time in Texas and last time after the Parkland shooting back in February we had a CNN Town Hall multiple high school students becoming instant celebrities and national marches being planned across the country but now just days after this Texas shooting the media seems that like they've just totally moved on so why do you think there's such a difference here well probably two reasons first of all I think liberals are learning a lesson that when you push for a really strict gun control measures it doesn't sit well with the American people it particularly doesn't sit well with that demographic of Americans who voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 but then voted for President Trump in 2016 those people don't want their guns to in a way and liberals I think this time after Parkland compared to all the other times that they've made pushes for gun control made it pretty clear that they wanted to take our guns away so that's probably a reason number one the polling just didn't pan out it wasn't a politically winning issue for them and they do have a big election coming up in 2018 the second reason I think is because of all the gun control proposals that Democrats have been pushing when we look at the surrounding data that we have about the Santa phase shooting that happened in Texas none of those proposals had they already been codified into law had Democrats been successful in pushing them would have stopped this shooter I mean background checks would have stopped him ammunition background checks would have stopped him banning ar-15s wouldn't have stopped him all the different things that Democrats are pushing for none of those things even if they had been law would have prevented this so what really are they what's their argument here got it I also think there has to be something to is they understood that the constituency may be of Texas he's different from parkland Florida which you know we we've had a couple the conservative students from that school on this week on Michael Knowles show and they said of course like ninety nine percent of that school is liberal so it's a different audience that they you know maybe knew that they couldn't win but yeah we also have this you mentioned the midterms so let's move on to that topic now the constant drip drip of this Russia investigation stormy Daniels is still in the news of course I've never seen so many gay men ecstatic to talk about a female porn star before the City of West Hollywood is giving her a whole day and now we have all this information about this FBI informant in the Trump campaign do you think that this hurts or helps President Trump and Republicans this year um probably half and half I mean I don't think the stormy Daniels story is helpful for president drama doesn't reflect well on him in a character sense but I think it also hasn't impacted polls which is very interesting to look at it hasn't impacted the president's approval or disapproval rating or whether Republicans or Democrats like him or dislike him and I think this is something interesting we talked about in my show last week I think it's because a lot of especially evangelical Christian voters had already taken this type of behavior Trump's admitted to his sexual promiscuity in the past think they already calculated this type of behavior into what they think of him and whether they think he could be a good president so in that sense no I don't think stormy Daniels helps him but all of the false allegations being thrown at him this you know when he calls a witch-hunt the intelligence community abusing their powers of surveillance and appearing to target the president and his campaign staffers because they don't like him that yeah I do think that helps him in a sense it's never helpful to be under attack in and of itself but it's certainly galvanizing his supporters to come to his defense which sometimes doesn't happen two years into a presidency that that's very true it'll be interesting to see if President Trump can buck the trend of a sitting president which statistically they usually lose midterm elections but some polling is looking really good for Republicans so the other day another cultural issue here Starbucks announced that anyone who walks into a Starbucks is a customer even if they don't buy anything so do you think that Starbucks will eventually regret this new kind of politically correct decision that they've made oh this is gonna backfire big time this is I mean what did their basically turn themselves into a homeless shelter Oh God if their if their policy is that you can hang out in there and loiter without buying anything you can use the bathroom how are they actually going to differentiate between people who are essentially living in their cafe I mean if I were most that's where I would go if they said that you could be there without buying anything yeah and we I don't know about you down San Diego but here in LA we already have a big problem with that Thanks yes Garcetti their virtue signaling they're trying to make it seem like they're woke like they're so progressive that they can you know handle the criticism they can you know check their white guilt here and make everything better but no as a business it's gonna backfire big-time okay we'll have to wait and see if Democrats went back the house do the going assumption and even some this week have said that they want to impeach President Trump do you think that this is going to backfire oh definitely I almost kind of hope they do try it not I mean it's not good for our country so in that sense I hope they don't try it but yeah this is gonna galvanize not only Republicans but there are actually believe it or not I have two percentage of Democrats who were rational people too those are the Democrats we don't see on cable news they don't they don't want to re-litigate this election they don't like President Trump and that's fine they're allowed to choose not to like the president but they respect our democratic elections they respect our republic and they don't want to just tear somebody down via impeachment when there's no proof of any high crimes and misdemeanors and Alicia I've not talked to a single Democrat who can answer that question what has he done where is the proof they cannot answer that they just don't like him you and me both I I personally think but I want to know your opinion on this do you think that a part of Trump kind of wants this to happen and he likes the drama of it oh like the twisted aspect let's bring it on yes he I'll take you on for that too um I don't know I don't know I don't I guess I don't always understand the inner workings of our president's mind here but he does seem he does seem always to be willing and eager and very capable to take on people that attack him so if it's gonna raise if it's gonna get galvanize supporters to support him even more and to turnout in the midterms or afterward for his reelection in 2020 I don't know I don't think he would hate it but I don't think he likes it as a person to be under attack either nobody does reporters from CNN and Politico were recently barred from EPA event with with secretary Pruitt over there and the president has also tweeted that he's considered removing certain media credentials I think mainly from CNN from White House press briefings do you think that this move is smart or really short-sighted well there's two things here no I never think it's smart to remove the credentials of mainstream journalists it just makes it just makes it look like you're trying to use your power just silence them so that's not a good move it's not a winning move I don't think the president's actually going to do that so I'm not that I guess up in arms about it we know the president makes comments out of emotion off-the-cuff and he doesn't follow through with it so until he does I'm just going to sort of brush it off and say like no that's a dumb idea but let me know when it's a reality my understanding though of the situation that happened with Pruitt was not that these news outlets were barred because of who they are because Trump doesn't like CNN or what not my understanding I wasn't there so these are just the reports that I've read was that there was a limited number of seats at the briefing and that once those seats were filled the rest of the journalists were we're told hey you have to sit in another room but we have a live feed streaming to you in there if that's the case in the mainstream media you know it's obviously crying wolf if there's something I don't know if someone was targeted specifically the that's wrong but it seems it seems if that's the case it's odd to me because the Democrats didn't have a problem with that happening under the Obama administration didn't have a problem with Obama targeting AP journalists or wired or snooping on the emails of James Rosen who at the time was with Fox News so it's probably just a case of overreaction I think all right you know do as they say not as they do I suppose it depends their reaction depends on which guys in the White House well right this has been so much fun thanks for coming on today and to everyone else watching thank you so much I am Alicia Kraus for The Daily wire and I'll see you soon you you
