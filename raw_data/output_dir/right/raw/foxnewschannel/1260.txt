1
00:00:00,396 --> 00:00:01,797
TIMES, WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE

2
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:02,298
FIVE TIMES.

3
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:03,699
THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE.

4
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:05,067
NO OTHER PRESIDENT BROUGHT IT UP

5
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:07,003
AND IT'S GOING TO BE DONE NOW.

6
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:07,770
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

7
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,174
TODAY'S D-DAY TO MAKE SURE IT

8
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:11,507
HAPPENS.

9
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:14,810
THE PRESIDENT REIMPLEMENTING

10
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,079
TARIFFS ON STEEL COMING IN FROM

11
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:17,980
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

12
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,516
IT WORKS OUT TO ABOUT 10% ON

13
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,852
ALUMINUM RELATED PRODUCTS.

14
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:25,021
IT GOES AFTER THE MEXICANS, THE

15
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,289
CANADIANS, THE EUROPEANS, ALL OF

16
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,090
WHOM SAYING THEY WILL RESPOND IN

17
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,457
KIND.

18
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:30,726
MEXICO PROMISED TO TARGET A

19
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,895
LIGHT NUMBER OF U.S. GOODS

20
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:34,263
EQUALLING THE SAME AMOUNT.

21
00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:37,833
THAT WOULD INCLUDE EVERYTHING

22
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,336
FROM GRAPES AND BERRIES AND PORK

23
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:43,039
CHOPS, CHEESE PRODUCTS, COLD

24
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,339
CUTS.

25
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:45,541
THE CANADIANS SAID THEY WILL

26
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,443
ADDRESS EVERYTHING FROM STEEL

27
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:50,513
AND ALUMINUM TO WHISKEY AND

28
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:51,714
ORANGE JUICE THAT MAKES ITS WAY

29
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:52,949
TO THEIR COUNTRY.

30
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,917
SO WHAT IS GOING ON?

31
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:57,587
DAN SIMMONS, THE UNITED STEEL

32
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:59,789
WORKER'S LOCAL.

33
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,358
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME.

34
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:03,526
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

35
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:06,062
IT'S A MESS AND IT IS SOMETHING

36
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:09,999
THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE

37
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:11,500
DISCUSSING.

38
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,437
THIS IS WHAT IS DIFFICULT, NEIL.

39
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:16,172
IT'S KIND OF A BITTER SWEET.

40
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:17,873
WE'VE BEEN PUSHING AND

41
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:19,275
ADVOCATING FOR SOME ASSISTANCE,

42
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,877
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR QUITE

43
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:23,479
SOME TIME.

44
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,548
SPECIFICALLY TO OUR BAD TRADE

45
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:28,217
PARTNERS THAT HAVE BEEN

46
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:31,153
ILLEGALLY DUMPING AND HARMING

47
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,688
OUR STEEL AND ALUMINUM FOR MANY

48
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:33,055
YEARS.

49
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,992
I'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR TEN

50
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:37,393
YEARS PLUS.

51
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:39,295
WE'VE BEEN FALLING ON DEAF EARS.

52
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,130
NOW WE PUSHED HARD ENOUGH AND

53
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,533
LOBBIED HARD ENOUGH TO GET THESE

54
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,502
INVESTIGATIONS STARTED.

55
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:47,737
THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT DID IN

56
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:50,006
FACT FIND HARM TO THE DEGREE OF

57
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:52,642
VERY STIFF DEGREES TO IMPOSE THE

58
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:59,615
25% AND 10% ON THE ALUMINUM.

59
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:00,916
THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S A BROAD

60
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:01,217
BRUSH.

61
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:02,885
WE HAVE MANY COUNTRIES THAT ARE

62
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:05,354
BAD TRADE PARTNERS, BUT WE HAVE

63
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:06,789
EQUALLY GOOD TRADE PARTNERS.

64
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,125
YOU KNOW, THE CANADA, OUR

65
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:09,792
SISTERS AND BROTHERS.

66
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,295
THEY'RE PART OF THE USW WITH US.

67
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:13,663
>> Neil: SO THE FACT THAT

68
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,364
THERE'S SO MANY OF YOUR CANADIAN

69
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:16,299
COLLEAGUES PART OF THIS AND

70
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:18,668
THEY'RE GETTING HURT BY THIS, SO

71
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:21,837
YOU GUYS ALMOST HAD NO CHOICE

72
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,072
BUT TO REJECT THIS.

73
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:25,975
BUT IT IS HELPING JOBS FOR STEEL

74
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:26,309
WORKERS.

75
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,510
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT?

76
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,246
>> IT SHOULD EQUATE TO SOME JOBS

77
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:31,714
CREATION SPECIFICALLY HERE IN

78
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:33,482
THE DOMESTIC MARKETS OBVIOUSLY.

79
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:36,552
IT'S GOING TO OPEN UP

80
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:38,421
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STEEL

81
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,056
INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES

82
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:41,657
AND ALONG WITH ALUMINUM.

83
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:43,059
YES, SHOULD EQUATE TO THAT.

84
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,394
OBVIOUSLY IT'S EARLY ON.

85
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:47,697
YEAH, I SEE NO OTHER WAY AND

86
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,965
SHOULD EQUATE TO SOME JOB

87
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:53,069
CREATION AND SOME PRICING ALONG

88
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,041
WITH SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS.

89
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,410
>> Neil: AND THE TARIFFS, THE

90
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,812
THOUGHT WAS COOLER HEADS WOULD

91
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:04,980
PREVAIL AND THIS IS A WAY TO

92
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,515
NEGOTIATE AND GET PEOPLE TO THE

93
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:06,816
TABLE.

94
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:09,518
THE POINT AT WHICH THAT DOESN'T

95
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:10,186
HAPPEN, OF COURSE.

96
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:11,921
THE THINGS YOU DIDN'T PLAN ON

97
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,455
ULTIMATELY HAPPEN.

98
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:13,889
WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS GOES?

99
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,791
>> I AGREE WITH YOU THERE.

100
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,259
ALREADY WE'VE SEEN WHERE THE

101
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,228
LEVERAGE HE'S HAD WITH THE --

102
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:22,131
GIVING THEM THE EXEMPTIONS

103
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:22,565
TEMPORARILY.

104
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:25,568
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RENEGOTIATE

105
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,470
SOME TRADE DEALS WITH KOREA,

106
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,238
WHICH THAT WAS A BAD TRADE

107
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:29,605
PARTNER.

108
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:30,740
NOW THEY LOCKED IN AND WORKED

109
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,641
OUT SOME DETAILS.

110
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:34,877
MY GUT FEELING IS JUST WHAT YOU

111
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:35,378
SAID.

112
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:37,947
THIS SHOULD FORCE PEOPLE TO LOOK

113
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:42,051
AT LEVELLING THE PLAYING FIELD.

114
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:43,386
THAT'S ALL WE'VE CRIED FOR FOR

115
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:45,521
YEARS AND LOBBIED HARD.

116
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:48,591
WE HAVE OLD TRADE LAWS IN THIS

117
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:49,425
COUNTRY, IN THE UNITED STATES.

118
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:50,926
WE'RE ASKING TO ENFORCE THE

119
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,762
TRADE LAWS ON THE BOOKS.

120
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:54,930
REWRITE WOULD BE GREAT.

121
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,865
MODERNIZE THEM, GREAT.

122
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:57,867
JUST GIVE US A LEVEL PLAYING

123
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:59,335
FIELD WE CAN COMPETE AGAINST

124
00:03:59,335 --> 00:03:59,668
ANYBODY.

125
00:03:59,668 --> 00:00:00,000
THE CHEATERS THAT ARE THE ONES
