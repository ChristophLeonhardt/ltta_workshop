EARLIER THIS WEEK ESPN MADE THE
DECISION TO SUSPEND ONE OF
ITS ANCHORS, OVER THE FACT THAT
SHE VIOLATED THE SOCIAL
MEDIA POLICY AND SHARED HER
POLITICAL OPINION ON TWITTER.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT
HAVE MISSED IT, HERE IS THE
REASON WHY SHE GOT SUSPENDED.
THESE TWEETS INCLUDED, HERE
YOU GO, JERRY JONES ALSO HAS
CAUSED
GREATER PROBLEMS FOR HIS PLAYERS
SPECIFICALLY THE BLACK ONES.
IF THEY DON'T KNEEL, SOME WILL
SEE THEM AS SELLOUTS.
SHE GOES ON IF YOU STRONGLY
REJECT WHAT JERRY JONES
SAID, THE KEYS IS ADVERTISERS.
DON'T PLACE THE BURDEN SQUARELY
ON THE PLAYERS.
AND THEN IN THIS WHOLE STRING,
SHE LATER CLARIFIES WITH
HER COMMENTS PUTTING THIS.
JUST A CLEAR: I'M NOT ADVOCATING
AN NFL BOYCOTT.
BUT AN UNFAIR BURDEN HAS BEEN
PUT ON PLAYERS IN DALLAS
AND MIAMI WITH ANTHEM
DIRECTORATES.
OF COURSE, SHE IS RESPONDING
TO OR COMMENTING ON THE
FACT THAT DALLAS COWBOYS OWNER
JERRY JONES SAID THAT HE
WOULD NOT TOLERATE ANY OF THE
PLAYERS ON THE TEAM
KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM.
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD BAR THEM
FROM PLAYING IF THEY DID SO
AND HILL REPORTS ON SPORTS AND
THIS HAS TO DO WITH SPORTS
AND I DON'T THINK SHE SAID
ANYTHING PARTICULARLY
CONTROVERSIAL, BUT OKAY, ESPN
DECIDED THEY SHE IS
VIOLATING OUR SOCIAL MEDIA
POLICY.
TO GET SUSPENDED AND OF COURSE
THE MANCHILD THAT WE HAVE
AS PRESIDENT DECIDED TO CHIME IN
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER
IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE TO FOCUS
ON.
EARLY MORNING TWEETS ABOUT
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HURT HIS
FEELINGS ARE WAY MORE IMPORTANT.
HE TWEETS OUT THE
FOLLOWING:
YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T REALLY EVER
TALK ABOUT HIS RATINGS BECAUSE
HIS RATINGS ARE DOING VERY
POORLY.
AROUND 40% APPROVAL RATING.
AND HE'S ALSO NOT A MAN OF
SUBSTANCE THAT WE DOESN'T
CARE IF YOU ARE RIGHT OR
WRONG, HE JUST CARES, ARE YOU
RATING WELL OR NOT?
AND OF COURSE HE IS WRONG ABOUT
THIS.
ESPN HAS ISSUES.
IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO
WITH JEMELE HILL.
THEY HAVE LOST 12 MILLION
SUBSCRIBERS IN THE LAST 12
MONTHS.
PEOPLE ARE CUTTING
THEIR CABLE PACKAGES.
WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE CHANNEL
ON ALL OF THE CABLE BUNDLES?
ESPN.
THEY ARE THE TIP OF THE SPEAR
FOR THE CABLE INDUSTRY SO
THEY LOSE THE MOST AMOUNT OF
SUBSCRIBERS WHEN PEOPLE CUT
THEIR CABLE CORD AND THEY DON'T
SUBSCRIBE ANYMORE.
THE REST OF CABLE ALSO LOSES
SUBSCRIBERS BUT NOT AS MANY
AS IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT IN
AS MANY HOMES.
I TOLD YOU WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
THEYÃ­RE
GOING TO START FIRING A LOT
OF THEIR HOST.
BILL SIMMONS SAID THE WRONG
THING, KEITH OVERMAN SAID THIS.
NO, THEY HAD TO THROW SALARIES
OVERBOARD BECAUSE THEY
STARTED LOSING SO MUCH MONEY
BECAUSE OF THE DYNAMIC OF
THE INDUSTRY HAVING NOTHING TO
DO WITH THE HOSTS OR WHAT
THERE'D PUTTING ON AIR.
BUT TRUMP OF COURSE IS WAY TOO
UNINTELLIGENT TO UNDERSTAND
OR CARE ABOUT THE INDUSTRY
DYNAMICS.
HE WOULD KNOW IF IT SLEPT IT
ACROSS HIS FACE.
THE RATINGS MAN, IT MUST BE
WRONG AND MUST BE BECAUSE
THE PERSON CRITICIZE ME.
I'M NOT APPRISED AT ALL THAT
HE IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING
ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON
WITH ESPN AND ITS RATINGS.
TO ME THAT'S NOT EVEN THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY.
THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY
HERE IS THAT WE HAVE THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
PUNISHING SOMEONE SPEECH.
THAT IS NOT ALLOWED.
THAT IS NOT ALLOWED BASED ON
THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF OUR
CONSTITUTION.
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
IF PRIVATE CITIZENS WANT TO
CRITICIZE HER, OF COURSE
THAT IS FAIR.
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.
IF ESPN WANTS TO SUSPEND HER,
THEY ARE NOT FUNDED BY THE
GOVERNMENT.
THEY ARE NOT A GOVERNMENT
ENTITY.
THEY'VE ALL THE RIGHT IN THE
WORLD TO SUSPEND HER, EVEN
THOUGH I DISAGREE WITH THEIR
DECISION.
BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES CANNOT PUSH FOR
PUNISHMENTS TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO
EXERCISE SPEECH THAT HE
DISAGREES WITH.
HE IS A MANCHILD.
HE IS LITERALLY THE TOP
SNOWFLAKE IN THIS COUNTRY,
PROBABLY INTERNATIONALLY.
HE CANNOT HANDLE ANY TYPE OF
CRITICISM WHATSOEVER AND
WHY IS HE SO HYPER FOCUSED ON
NONSENSE LIKE THIS?
THIS TWEET HAPPENED AT 3:42 IN
THE MORNING.
THE GUY IS A LUNATIC.
GO TO SLEEP.
I WILL TELL YOU WHY.
WHY IS HE OBSESSED WITH BLACK
PLAYERS KNEELING OR JEMELE HILL.
YOU KNOW WHY.
HE IS A WHITE SUPREMACIST.
HE IS.
IN HIS BONES, HE IS RACIST
THROUGH AND THROUGH.
THAT IS WHY NOT ONLY DID HE NOT
BELIEVE THAT OBAMA WAS A US
CITIZEN, HE DEMANDED HIS COLLEGE
TRANSCRIPTS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT,
HOW COULD A BLACK GUY GET GOOD
GRADES AT COLUMBIA AND HARVARD?
HE IS DEEPLY RACIST.
THAT IS HIS ASSUMPTIONS.
CENTRAL PARK FIVE, WE'VE BEEN
OVER ALL OF THE STUFF.
GUYS WHO DIDN'T DO IT.
HE IS LIKE I GUESS YOU ROT
IN JAIL ANYWAY.
THEY ARE BLACK, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?
SO JAMELE
HILL GETS UNDER HIS SKIN BECAUSE
SHE IS POINTING OUT WHAT HE
IS, HE IS A RACIST MONSTER AND
THAT IS WHY HE HATES THOSE
BLACK PLAYERS WHO ARE PROTESTING
POLICE ABUSE.
I LIKE THAT SOME OF THE OTHER ON
THEIR PEOPLE AT ESPN AND ARE
FIGHTING BACK.
THEY ARE FIGHTING BACK.
SOME OF HER COLLEAGUES HAVE
TWEETED IN SUPPORT OF HILL
AND I APPRECIATE THEM FOR DOING
IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW
THAT THEY MIGHT GET SUSPENDED
OVER THIS.
LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES.
JOSINA ANDERSON SAYS:
I WANT TO STOP THERE FOR A
SECOND BECAUSE I WANT THOSE
ON THE RIGHT WHO CANNOT HANDLE
ANYONE CRITICIZING YOUR
DEAR LEADER TO IMAGINE THE SHOE
ON THE OTHER FOOT.
IMAGINE OBAMA PUSHING FOR
PUNISHMENTS AGAINST SOMEONE
LIKE SEAN HANNITY.
1ST OF ALL, WE WOULD CONDEMN
HIM FOR THAT AND YOU WOULD
DEFINITELY CONDEMN HIM FOR THAT
AS YOU SHOULD BECAUSE THAT
IS A VIOLATION OF THE
CONSTITUTION.IN THIS CASE,
TRUMP IS DOING IN THE RIGHT WING
IS LIKE YEAH, WHATEVER.
SHE SHOULD GET FIRED.
THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AT ALL
THAT HE TELLS THEM THAT THEY
SHOULD SHUT UP, THE PLAYERS.
NOW JEMELE HILL AND YOU APPLAUD
HIM.
AS ANA POINTED OUT, ESPN CAN DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT AND WHEN IT
COMES TO THEIR ADVERTISERS THEY
GET EVEN TOUCHIER, BUT WHEN THE
PRESIDENT IS PRESSURING ESPN OR
THE COWBOYS OR THE NFL TO FIRE
PEOPLE OR NOT PAY THEM OR
SUSPEND THEM, THAT IS A
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE, AND IF YOU
CARE ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, YOU
SHOULD BE OUTRAGED AND IF YOU
ARE NOT OUTRAGED, JUST UP
PRETENDING YOU CARE ABOUT
THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE
CONSTITUTION.
