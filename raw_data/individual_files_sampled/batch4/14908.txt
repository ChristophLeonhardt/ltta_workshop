let me show you some local Vancouver media coverage so on the day when Ibrahim Ali was first brought into court a local Syrian activist named Mohammad Al Salam thought he'd go and grab some of the publicity for himself a quick Google search will show you that Allah is a professional immigration agitator and propagandist who literally does the political speaking circuit promoting Muslim immigration to the west it's his profession he's an organizer and he was very organized he contacted all the media in the City of Vancouver and told them the official Syrian refugee approved narrative that this murder has nothing to do with the accused being a Syrian refugee and even if it does Syrians are just as mad as the Chinese community has very important than the media not be you know it's a boring Chinese stuff about a Chinese Canadian girl murdered and possibly raped which I think it's the reason it's a first-degree murder charge no no it's about the noble Syrian refugee stories all about them in the media didn't just report this strategy by Al Silla they helped organize it they published a video of Al Salam advertising his huge rally of Syrians in support of Marissa they literally embedded his PR video right into the Vancouver Sun's main web site with a beautiful promotional propaganda piece underneath it I mean what's that $100,000 worth of PR gifted to a minimum also lob viously worked the phones because by the time he showed up at court he had oh I don't know maybe four other Syrians with him grand total for some reason oh and other than his professional activist friends came along funny how that worked they were literally more left-wing media reporting on his fake vigil than there were people at that vigil but to the media surprise some actual Chinese Canadians were actually there and for some reason they didn't want to talk about how much they loved Syrian refugees they didn't want to talk about what a normal guy Ibrahim Ibrahim Ali is how handsome he is have a smile just lights up a room or what ever the line today is how unexpected that's the line most of the media used it was so unexpected take a look at this this was not the scene we expected here in downtown Vancouver this morning we are outside the Vancouver provincial court house we were expecting a planned vigil to materialize by members of the Syrian community living in Metro Vancouver they had told us that they were going to come and show their support for Marissa Chen's family now instead we have seen dozens of counter protesters show up they say they are also here in support of Chen's family but they have a very different message what we are here yes we demand and Prime Minister two approaches this morning members of the Syrian community as I said had planned to hold vigil outside the Vancouver courthouse that was drowned out by these counter protesters who say Ally never should have been here in the first place you want your dough to address this alive right a life got terminated at a thirty years old and where's the leader is a sad thing for him human being and not only for our community yeah it should be the murder should be punished they call that Chinese protest unexpected really did you think normal Canadians are suspect and crime as they are or obsessed with Muslim migrants as they are but give global news credit they actually allow a very brief criticism of Justin Trudeau to go to air as you saw amazing they'd allow that that's actually the unexpected part here that's an excerpt from my daily show the as relevant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
