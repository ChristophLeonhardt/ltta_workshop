The hearing to
confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh
to the Supreme
Court has been long
and at times quite
contentious.
It has also raised a series of legal
questions from our readers
and I’m going to try to
answer some of them.
One theme has been the issue
of Roe v. Wade,
the landmark 1973
Supreme Court decision
that established a
constitutional right
to abortion.
Senators are
interested, of course,
in how Judge
Kavanaugh might vote
should the question of
overturning Roe v. Wade
reach the Supreme Court.
In contemporary American politics,
it’s of course perfectly
fine to ask questions
about faith and Judge
Kavanaugh was asked.
“I am religious
and I am Catholic
and I grew up attending
Catholic schools.”
But it’s a very
different thing
to connect up those
questions of faith
to how a judge might
rule.
Then a number of you
asked about documents
that were released ahead
of the hearing.
Democratic
senators complained
that they’d been denied
access to various kinds
of documents —
“We should have a thorough
understanding of the nominee
that’s put before us
so that we can vet them.” —
or that some of the
documents had only
been provided to them
on a so-called committee
confidential basis,
making it impossible,
they said, for them to
ask sensible questions
of the nominee.
There’s a lot of
mystery and frustration
about which
documents are where.
The laws governing
these documents
are quite complicated.
And whether it’s legal or
not is maybe not exactly
the right question.
The Senate controls
its own processes
and the majority in the
Senate, currently Republican,
for the most part gets to make
the rules.
“Without objection.”
Lastly, people were wondering
how unusual this hearing is.
It’s not at all
unusual for the Senate
to ask nominees to
the Supreme Court
for all of the information
senators can gather
and most nominees turn
over just about everything.
What’s unusual about
Judge Kavanaugh is
that in his life
he has generated millions
and millions of documents.
It’s unusual that
he’s not turning over
every single document
that a nominee typically does.
But there are extenuating
circumstances.
