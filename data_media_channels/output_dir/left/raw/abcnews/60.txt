1
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,314
>> GOOD DAY.

2
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,349
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,583
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 

4
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,386
ANNOUNCE A NEW STRATEGY ON IRAN 

5
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:24,390
THAT'S HE'S DESERT FIEING THE 

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,693
NUCLEAR DEAL PUT IN PLACE BY 

7
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,029
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,765
THE U.N. OUR ALLIES EVEN THE 

9
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:36,169
PRESIDENT'S TOP ADVISORS ALL 

10
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,440
AGREE IRAN IS ABIDING BY THE 

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:40,707
AGREEMENT.

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,974
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING THIS 

13
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:44,544
ACTION TODAY BECAUSE HE DOESN'T 

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,445
BELIEVE IT WAS TOUGH ENOUGH.

15
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,681
I WANT TO BRING IN JON KARL.

16
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,349
JON, THE PRESIDENT PROMISED TO 

17
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,285
RIP UP THE DEAL ON THE FIRST DAY

18
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,286
OF HIS PRESIDENCY.

19
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,488
THE ACTION HE'S TAKING TODAY 

20
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,522
DOESN'T DO THAT. 

21
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:58,925
>> THIS DOES NOT DO THAT.

22
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,593
IT'S A HALFWAY MEASURE THAT 

23
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,627
GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE 

24
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,596
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY HE DOES NOT 

25
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:07,099
LIKE THE DEAL AND AT THE VERY 

26
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:08,801
LEAST IRAN IS VIOLATING THE 

27
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:09,569
SPIRIT OF IT.

28
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,005
IT DOES NOT RIP IT UP.

29
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,540
DOING SO WOULD EFFECTIVELY MAKE 

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,709
THE WORST DEAL EVER EVEN WORSE.

31
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,645
IRAN GOT THE BENEFIT OF THIS 

32
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:20,847
AGREEMENT UPFRONT.

33
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,649
IF THEY RIP THE AGREEMENT UP 

34
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,184
NOW, THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GO 

35
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,653
BACK TO DOING WHAT WAS THEIR 

36
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,253
PART OF THE AGREEMENT. 

37
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,254
>> HERE'S THE PRESIDENT. 

38
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,357
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

39
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,727
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, AS 

40
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:35,361
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

41
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,831
MY HIGHEST OBLIGATION IS TO 

42
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,300
INSURE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY 

43
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,972
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

44
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,408
HISTORY HAS SHOWN THE LONGER WE 

45
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,809
IGNORE A THREAT THE MORE 

46
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,277
DANGEROUS THAT THREAT BECOMES.

47
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,147
FOR THIS REASON UPON TAKING 

48
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,316
OFFICE, I'VE ORDERED A COMPLETE 

49
00:01:57,316 --> 00:02:00,653
STRATEGIC REVIEW OF OUR POLICY 

50
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,958
TOWARD THE ROGUE REGIME IN IRAN.

51
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,327
THAT REVIEW IS NOW COMPLETE.

52
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:12,565
TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING OUR 

53
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,934
STRATEGY ALONG WITH SEVERAL 

54
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,037
MAJOR STEPS WE'RE TAKING TO 

55
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,073
CONFRONT THE REIGNING REGIME'S 

56
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,976
HOSTILE ACTIONS AND TO INSURE 

57
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,112
IRAN NEVER -- AND I MEAN 

58
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,314
NEVER -- ACQUIRES A NUCLEAR 

59
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:28,948
WEAPON.

60
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,418
OUR POLICY IS BASED ON A 

61
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,354
CLEAR-EYED ASSESSMENT OF THE 

62
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:39,358
IRANIAN DICTATORSHIP, ITS 

63
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:40,760
SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM AND IT 

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,762
CONTINUING AGGRESSION IN THE 

65
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,665
MIDDLE EAST AND ALL AROUND THE 

66
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:45,932
WORLD.

67
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:50,970
IRAN IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF A 

68
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,472
FANATICAL REGIME THAT SEIZED 

69
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,441
POWER IN 1979 AND FORCED A PROUD

70
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:59,745
PEOPLE TO SUBMIT TO ITS 

71
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:02,115
EXTREMIST RULE.

72
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,283
THIS RADICAL REGIME HAS RAIDED 

73
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:07,153
THE WEALTH OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S

74
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,922
OLDEST AND MOST VIBRANT NATIONS 

75
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:12,325
AND SPREAD DEATH, DESTRUCTION 

76
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,462
AND CHAOS ALL AROUND THE GLOBE.

77
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:23,202
BEGINNING IN 1979 AGENTS OF THE 

78
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,670
IRANIAN REGIME ILLEGALLY SEIZED 

79
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,307
THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEHRAN AND 

80
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:30,777
HELD MORE THAN 60 AMERICANS 

81
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,478
HOSTAGE DURING THE 444 DAYS OF 

82
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,482
THE CRISIS.

83
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,752
THE IRANIAN-BACKED TERRORIST 

84
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:47,993
GROUP HTWICE BOMBED OUR EMBASSY 

85
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:52,465
ONCE IN 1983 AND AGAIN IN 1984.

86
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,501
ANOTHER IRANIAN BOMBING KILLED 

87
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,437
241 AMERICANS.

88
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,938
SERVICE MEMBERS THEY WERE IN 

89
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:07,547
THEIR BARRACKS IN BEIHRUT IN 

90
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,451
1993.

91
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,885
IN 1996 THEY BOMBED HOUSE NG 

92
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:24,097
ASSAD I CSAUDI RAB I CAN'T.

93
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,201
OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSIES IN 

94
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:33,272
KENYA, TANZANIA AND KILLING 224 

95
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,909
PEOPLE AND WOUNDING MORE THAN 

96
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,111
4,000 OTHERS.

97
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,280
THE REGIME HARBORED HIGH LEVEL 

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,686
TERRORISTS IN THE WAKE OF THE 

99
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:50,356
9/11 ATTACKS INCLUDING OSAMA BIN

100
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,226
LADEN'S SON.

101
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,194
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN GROUPS 

102
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,196
SUPPORTED BY IRAN HAVE KILLED 

103
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,999
HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN MILITARY 

104
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:00,767
PERSONNEL.

105
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,335
THE IRANIAN'S DICTATORSHIP 

106
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:04,404
AGGRESSION CONTINUES TO THIS 

107
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:04,670
DAY.

108
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,473
THE REGIME REMAINS THE WORLD'S 

109
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,375
LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF 

110
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,411
TERRORISM AND PROVIDES 

111
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:17,517
ASSISTANCE TO AL QUAEDA, THE 

112
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,486
TALIBAN, HA MASS AND OTHER 

113
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,588
TERRORIST NETWORKS.

114
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,690
IT DEVELOPS, DEPLOYS AND PRO 

115
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,959
LIVE RATES MISSILES THAT 

116
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,795
THREATEN AMERICAN TROOPS AND OUR

117
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,396
ALLIES.

118
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,198
IT HARASSES AMERICAN SHIPS AND 

119
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,867
THREATEN FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION 

120
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,738
IN THE ARAB JANUARY GULF AND RED

121
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,539
SEA.

122
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,575
IT I AM PRISONS AMERICANS ON 

123
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,609
FALSE CHARGES.

124
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:47,046
IT LAUNCHES CYBER ATTACKS 

125
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,881
AGAINST OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, 

126
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,217
FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND MILITARY.

127
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,953
THE UNITED STATES IS FAR FROM 

128
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,256
THE ONLY TARGET OF THE IRANIAN 

129
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,791
DICTATORSHIP'S LONG CAMPAIGN OF 

130
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,226
BLOOD SHED.

131
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,361
THE REGIME VIOLENTLY SUPPRESSES 

132
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,531
ITS OWN CITIZENS.

133
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,035
IT SHOT UNARMED STUDENT PRO 

134
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,169
PROTESTERS IN THE STREET DURING 

135
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,504
THE GREEN REVOLUTION.

136
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,641
THIS REGIME HAS FUELED VIOLENCE 

137
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,744
IN IRAQ AND VICIOUS CIVIL WARS 

138
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,513
IN YEMEN AND SYRIA.

139
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,482
IN SYRIA THE IRANIAN REGIME 

140
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:28,821
SUPPORTED THE ATROCITIES OF 

141
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,858
BASHAR AL ASSAD'S REGIME AND 

142
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:34,860
CONDONED HIS USE OF CHEMICAL 

143
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,165
WEAPONS AGAINST HELPLESS SI 

144
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,635
VIVIANS INCLUDING MANY MANY 

145
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:42,902
CHILDREN.

146
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,104
GIVEN THE REGIME'S PAST AND 

147
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,406
PRESENT WE SHOULD NOT TAKE 

148
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,976
LIGHTLY ITS SINISTER VISION FOR 

149
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:50,476
THE FUTURE.

150
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:54,380
THE REGIME'S TWO FAVORITE CHANTS

151
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,515
ARE DEATH TO AMERICA AND DEATH 

152
00:06:56,515 --> 00:07:02,155
TO ISRAEL ICING THE GRAVITY OF 

153
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,258
THE SITUATION THE UNITED STATES 

154
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:12,698
AND THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY 

155
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,635
COUNCIL WANTED TO STOP THE 

156
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:19,338
PURSUIT WITH A WIDE AYE RARE OF 

157
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,072
SANCTIONS.

158
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,776
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 

159
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,743
LIFTED THE SANCTIONS RIGHT 

160
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,245
BEFORE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 

161
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,281
TOTAL COLLAPSE OF THE IRANIAN 

162
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,649
REGIME.

163
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,554
THROUGH THE DEEPLY CONTROVERSIAL

164
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,088
2015 NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN.

165
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,857
IT'S KNOWN AS THE JOINT 

166
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:42,194
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION OR 

167
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:42,562
JCPOA.

168
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,297
AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES THE 

169
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:47,266
IRAN DEAL WAS ONE OF THE WORST 

170
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,303
AND MOST ONE-SIDED TRANSACTIONS 

171
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,771
THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER 

172
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:53,806
ENTERED INTO.

173
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,741
THE SAME MIND SET THAT PRODUCED 

174
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,644
THIS DEAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 

175
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,013
YEARS OF TERRIBLE TRADE DEALS 

176
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,616
THAT HAVE SACRIFICED SO MANY 

177
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,486
MILLIONS OF JOBS IN OUR COUNTRY 

178
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,788
TO THE BENEFIT OF OTHER 

179
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,190
COUNTRIES.

180
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:18,430
WE NEED NEGOTIATORS WHO 

181
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,501
REPRESENT AMERICAN'S INTERESTS.

182
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,371
THE NUCLEAR DEAL PROVIDING 

183
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,307
URGENTLY NEEDED RELIEF FROM THE 

184
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,311
INTENTION DOMESTIC PRESSURE THE 

185
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,880
SANCTIONS HAD CREATED.

186
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,015
IT ALSO GAVE THE REGIME A 

187
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:41,086
FINANCIAL BOOST AND OVER $100 

188
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,254
BILLION ITS GOVERNMENT COULD USE

189
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:43,522
TO FUND TERRORISM.

190
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:46,125
THE REGIME ALSO RECEIVED A 

191
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:51,931
MASSIVE CASH SETTLEMENT OF 

192
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,531
$1.7 BILLION FROM THE UNITED 

193
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,601
STATES, A LARGE PORTION OF WHICH

194
00:08:55,601 --> 00:09:00,239
WAS PHYSICALLY LOADED ON TO AN 

195
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,807
AIRPLANE AND FLOWN INTO IRAN.

196
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,143
JUST IMAGINE THE SIGHT OF THOSE 

197
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,646
HUGE PILES OF MONEY BEING HAULED

198
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,881
OFF BY THE IRANIANS WAITING AT 

199
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:13,119
THE AIRPORT FOR THE CASH.

200
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,687
I WONDER WERE ALL THAT MONEY 

201
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,154
WENT.

202
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,489
WORST OF ALL THE DEAL ALLOWS 

203
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:18,691
IRAN TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING 

204
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,859
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF ITS NUCLEAR 

205
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:23,362
PROGRAM AND IMPORTANTLY IN JUST 

206
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:30,369
A FEW YEARS AS KEY RESTRICTIONS 

207
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,303
DISAPPEAR, IRAN CAN SPRINT 

208
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:34,807
TOWARDS A RAPID NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

209
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:35,975
BREAK OUT.

210
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,612
IN OTHER WORDS, WE GOT WEAK 

211
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,113
INSPECTIONS FOR EXCHANGE FOR NO 

212
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:45,518
MORE THAN A PURELY SHORT TERM 

213
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,386
AND TEMPORARY DELAY IN IRAN'S 

214
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,689
PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

215
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,424
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A DEAL 

216
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:55,160
THAT AT BEST ONLY DELAYS IRAN'S 

217
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,595
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY FOR A SHORT 

218
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,465
PERIOD OF TIME.

219
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,034
THIS AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

220
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,936
STATES IS UNACCEPTABLE.

221
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,672
IN OTHER COUNTRIES THEY THINK IN

222
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,375
TERMS OF 100 YEAR INTERVALS, NOT

223
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:15,548
JUST A FEW YEARS AT A TIME.

224
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:23,355
THE SADDEST PART WAS ALL THE 

225
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:26,825
MONEY WAS PAID UPFRONT RATHER 

226
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,761
THAN THE END OF THE DEAL WHEN 

227
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,761
THEY SHOW THEY HAVE PLAYED BY 

228
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:30,896
THE RULES.

229
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,398
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

230
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,468
THAT'S WHY WE ARE WHERE WE ARE.

231
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,137
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS COMMITTED

232
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,207
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS OF THE 

233
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:41,474
AGREEMENT.

234
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,576
FOR EXAMPLE, ON TWO SEPARATE 

235
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:48,514
OCCASIONS THEY HAVE EXCEEDED THE

236
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,984
LIMIT OF 130 METRIC TONS OF 

237
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,952
HEAVY WATER.

238
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,521
UNTIL RECENTLY THE IRANIAN 

239
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,289
REGIME HAS ALSO FAILED TO MEET 

240
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,425
OUR EXPECTATIONS IN ITS 

241
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:04,597
OPERATION OF ADVANCED CENTURY 

242
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:04,864
FUJS.

243
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:12,405
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS ALSO 

244
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,640
INTIMIDATED INSPECTORS TO NOT 

245
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,408
USING THE FULL INSPECTION 

246
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:18,711
AUTHORITIES THE AGREEMENT CALLS 

247
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,445
FOR.

248
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,780
IRANIAN OFFICIALS AND MILITARY 

249
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,782
LEADERS CLAIM THEY WON'T ALLOW 

250
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:27,319
INSPECT ORS ON TO MILITARY SITES

251
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,021
EVEN THOUGH THE INTERNATIONAL 

252
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,355
COMMUNITY SUSPECTED SOME OF 

253
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:33,325
THOSE SITES WERE PART OF IRAN'S 

254
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,294
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

255
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,562
THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO 

256
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,897
BELIEVE THAT IRAN IS DEALING 

257
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:39,565
WITH NORTH KOREA.

258
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:45,070
I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT OUR 

259
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,673
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO DO A 

260
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,575
THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND REPORT 

261
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,710
BACK THEIR FINDINGS BEYOND WHAT 

262
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,978
THEY HAVE ALREADY REVIEWED.

263
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,080
BY ITS OWN TERMS THE IRAN DEAL 

264
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,417
WAS SUPPOSED TO CONTRIBUTE TO 

265
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,520
REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PEACE

266
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,755
AND SECURITY.

267
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,357
YET, WHILE THE UNITED STATES 

268
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,027
ADHERES TO OUR COMMITMENT UNDER 

269
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,063
THE DEAL, THE IRANIAN REGIME 

270
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,532
CONTINUES TO FEEL CONFLICT, 

271
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,867
TERROR AND TURMOIL THROUGHOUT 

272
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,037
THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND.

273
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,639
IMPORTANTLY IRAN IS NOT LIVING 

274
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,676
UP TO THE SPIRIT OF THE DEAL.

275
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,079
SO TODAY IN RECOGNITION OF THE 

276
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,481
INCREASING MENACE POSED BY IRAN 

277
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,617
AND AFTER EXTENSIVE 

278
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,019
CONSULTATIONS WITH OUR ALLIES, I

279
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,056
AM ANNOUNCING A NEW STRATEGY TO 

280
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,692
ADDRESS THE FULL RANGE OF IRAN'S

281
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,527
DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS.

282
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,829
FIRST, WE WILL WORK WITH OUR 

283
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,233
ALLIES TO COUNTER THE REGIMES 

284
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:52,004
DID HE STABLE ICING ACTIVITY AND

285
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,204
SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST PROXIES IN

286
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:54,540
THE REGION.

287
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,576
SECOND, WE'LL PLACE ADDITIONAL 

288
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,777
SANCTIONS ON THE REGIME TO BLOCK

289
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,679
THEIR FINANCING OF TERROR.

290
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,218
THIRD, WE'LL ADDRESS THE REGIMES

291
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,452
PROLIFERATION OF MISSILE AND 

292
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,788
WEAPONS THAT THREATEN ITS 

293
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,223
NEIGHBORS GLOBAL TRADE.

294
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:15,427
FINALLY, WE'LL DENY THE REGIME 

295
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,764
ALL PATHS TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

296
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,065
TODAY I'M ALSO ANNOUNCING 

297
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:27,373
SEVERAL MAJOR STEPS MY 

298
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,740
ADMINISTRATION IS TAKEN IN 

299
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,509
PURSUIT OF THE STRATEGY.

300
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,412
THE EXECUTION BEGINS WITH THE 

301
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,315
LONG OVERDUE STEP OF IMPOSING 

302
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:42,821
SUF SANCTIONS ON IRAN'S ISLAMIC 

303
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,489
GUARD CORP.

304
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,993
THAT'S THE IRANIAN'S SUPREME 

305
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,995
LEADER'S CORRUPT PERSONAL TERROR

306
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,764
FORCE AND MILITIA.

307
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,768
IT HAS HIJACK LARGE PORTIONS OF 

308
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,136
IRAN'S ECONOMY AND SEEKS 

309
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:02,207
RELIGIOUS EVEN DO YOUMENTS TO 

310
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,977
HAVE WAR AND TERROR ABROAD.

311
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:09,748
THIS INCLUDES SUPPLYING MISSILES

312
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,817
AND WEAPON TOSS ATTACK CIVILIANS

313
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,186

TO BOMB A POPULAR RESTAURANT IN 

315
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,123
WASHINGTON D.C.

316
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,593
I'M AUTHORIZING THE TREASURY 

317
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:25,430
DEPARTMENT TO SANCTION THE 

318
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,766
ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD 

319
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,770
CORP. FOR ITS SUPPORT OF 

320
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,070
TERRORISM.

321
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,173
I URGE OUR ALLIES TO JOIN US IN 

322
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,677
TAKING STRONG ACTIONS TO CURB 

323
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,912
IRAN'S CONTINUED DANGEROUS AND 

324
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:45,317
DESTABILIZING BEHAVIOR INCLUDING

325
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,419
THOROUGH SANCTIONS OUTSIDE THE 

326
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,355
IRAN DEAL THAT TARGET THE 

327
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,223
REGIME'S BALLISTIC MISSILE 

328
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,058
PROGRAM IN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM

329
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,694
AND ALL OF ITS DESTRUCTIVE 

330
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:56,962
ACTIVITIES OF WHICH THERE ARE 

331
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,530
MANY.

332
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,000
FINALLY, ON THE GRAVE MATTER OF 

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,068
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM SINCE THE

334
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,570
SIGNING OF THE NUCLEAR 

335
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,671
AGREEMENT, THE REGIME'S 

336
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:10,676
DANGEROUS AGGRESSION HAS ONLY 

337
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:10,943
ESCALATED.

338
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,878
AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS RECEIVED

339
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,514
MASSIVE SANCTIONS RELIEF WHILE 

340
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,449
CONTINUING TO DEVELOP ITS 

341
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,484
MISSILE PROGRAM.

342
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,453
IRAN HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO 

343
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,654
LUCRATIVE BUSINESS CONTRACTS 

344
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,023
WITH OTHER PARTIES THROUGH THE 

345
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:24,290
AGREEMENT.

346
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,761
WHEN THE AGREEMENT WAS FINALIZED

347
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,761
IN 2015, CONGRESS PASSED THE 

348
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,963
IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT REVIEW 

349
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:35,534
ACT TO INSURE THAT CONGRESS' 

350
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,935
VOICE WOULD BE HEARD ON THE 

351
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:37,135
DEAL.

352
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,671
AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS THIS LAW 

353
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:42,340
REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT OR HIS 

354
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,843
DESIGNEE TO CERTIFY THAT THE 

355
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,446
SUSPENSION OF SANCTIONS UNDER 

356
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,383
THE DEAL IS APPROPRIATE AND 

357
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,852
PROPORTIONATE TO MEASURE AND 

358
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,656
OTHER MEASURES TAKEN BY IRAN TO 

359
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,858
TERM IT'S ELICIT NUCLEAR 

360
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,126
PROGRAM.

361
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,094
BASED ON THE FACTUAL RECORD I 

362
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:05,630
HAVE PUT FORWARD, I AM 

363
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,101
ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT WE CANNOT 

364
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,772
AND WILL NOT MAKE THIS 

365
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,105
CERTIFICATION.

366
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:17,309
WE WILL NOT CONTINUE DOWN A PATH

367
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,545
WHOSE PREDICTABLE CONCLUSION IS 

368
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,047
MORE VIOLENCE, MORE TERROR AND 

369
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,315
THE VERY REAL THREAT OF IRAN'S 

370
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,218
NUCLEAR BREAK OUT.

371
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,254
THAT IS WHY I AM DIRECTING MY 

372
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,889
ADMINISTRATION TO WORK CLOSELY 

373
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,192
WITH CONGRESS AND OUR ALLIES TO 

374
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:38,196
ADDRESS THE DEAL'S MANY SERIOUS 

375
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:41,199
FLAWS SO THAT THE IRANIAN REGIME

376
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,001
CAN NEVER THREATEN THE WORLD 

377
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,003
WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

378
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,638
THESE INCLUDE THE DEALS SUNSET 

379
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,841
CLAUSES THAT IN JUST A FEW YEARS

380
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,276
WILL ELIMINATE KEY RESTRICTIONS 

381
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,712
ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

382
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,816
THE FLAWS IN THE DEAL ALSO 

383
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,119
INCLUDE INSUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT

384
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,422
AND NEAR TOTAL SILENCE ON IRAN'S

385
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,624
MISSILE PROGRAMS.

386
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,526
CONGRESS HAS ALREADY BEGUN THE 

387
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,096
WORK TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.

388
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,266
KEY HOUSE AND SENATE LEADERS ARE

389
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,101
DRAFTING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD 

390
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,570
AMEND THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT

391
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,839
REVIEW ACT TO STRENGTHEN 

392
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,108
ENFORCEMENT AND PREVENT IRAN 

393
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,211
FROM DEVELOPING AN INTERNET -- 

394
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:31,016
THIS IS SO TOTALLY IMPORTANT -- 

395
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:38,356
AN INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 

396
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,392
MISSILE AND MAKE THIS PERMANENT 

397
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,796
UNDER U.S. LAW, SO IMPORTANT.

398
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,933
I SUPPORT THESE INITIATIVES.

399
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:53,138
HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT WE'RE NOT 

400
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:59,644
ABLE TO REACH A SOLUTION WORKING

401
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:00,245
WITH CONGRESS AND OUR ALLIES 

402
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:00,812
THEN THE AGREEMENT WILL BE 

403
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:01,547
TERMINATED.

404
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,116
IT'S UNDER CONTINUOUS REVIEW AND

405
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,052
OUR PARTICIPATION CAN BE 

406
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,854
CANCELED BY ME AS PRESIDENT AT 

407
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,121
ANY TIME.

408
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,889
AS WE HAVE SEEN IN NORTH KOREA 

409
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,358
THE LONGER WE IGNORE A THREAT, 

410
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:17,696
THE WORSE THAT THREAT BECOMES.

411
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,932
IT IS WHY WE ARE DETERMINED THAT

412
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,068
THE WORLD'S LEADING SPONSOR OF 

413
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,903
TERRORISM WILL NEVER OBTAIN 

414
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,338
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

415
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,708
IN THIS EVENT WE STAND IN TOTAL 

416
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,077
SOLIDARITY WITH THE IRANIAN 

417
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:36,715
REGIME'S LONGEST SUFFERING 

418
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,351
VICTIMS, ITS OWN PEOPLE.

419
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,353
THE CITIZENS OF IRAN HAVE PAID A

420
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,056
HEAVY PRICE FOR THE VIOLENCE AND

421
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,624
EXTREMISM OF THEIR LEADERS.

422
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,060
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE -- THEY JUST 

423
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,498
ARE LONGING TO RECLAIM THEIR 

424
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:57,169
COUNTRY'S PROUD HISTORY, ITS 

425
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,173
CULTURE, IT'S CIVIL SAIGS, ITS 

426
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,442
COOPERATION WITH ITS NEIGHBORS.

427
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,610
WE HOPE THESE NEW MEASURES 

428
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,646
DIRECTED AT THE IRANIAN 

429
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,582
DICTATORSHIP WILL COMPEL THE 

430
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,985
GOVERNMENT RE-EVALUATE ITS 

431
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,520
PURSUIT OF TERROR AT THE EXPENSE

432
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,655
OF ITS PEOPLE.

433
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,224
WE HOPE OUR ACTIONS BRING ABOUT 

434
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,859
A FUTURE OF PEACE STABILITY AND 

435
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:27,599
PROSPERITY IN THE MIDDLE'S, A 

436
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,270
FUTURE WHERE SOLVE REN NATIONS 

437
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,438
RESPECT EACH OTHER.

438
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,875
WE PRAY FOR A FUTURE WHERE YOUNG

439
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,579
CHILDREN CAN GROW UP IN A WORLD 

440
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,348
FREE FROM VIOLENCE, HATRED AND 

441
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:43,949
TERROR.

442
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,784
UNTIL THAT BLESSED DAY COMES 

443
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,520
WE'LL DO WHAT WE MUST TO KEEP 

444
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,522
AMERICA SAVE.

445
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,089
THANK YOU.

446
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,559
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS, 

447
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:54,993
AMERICA.

448
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:55,360
THANK YOU. 

449
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,928
>> FIERCE WORDS FROM PRESIDENT 

450
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:59,798
TRUMP FOR THE IRANIAN REGIME AND

451
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,466
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL CALLING IT A 

452
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,335
ROGUE REGIME, THE WORLD'S 

453
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,770
GREATEST SPONSOR OF TERROR.

454
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,003
SEE THE PRESIDENT WALK OUT OF 

455
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:07,472
THE DIPLOMATIC ROOM.

456
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,108
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD 

457
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,110
DESERT FIE THAT NUCLEAR DEAL AND

458
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,580
IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS ON IRAN'S 

459
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,382
REVOLUTION NAR GUARD.

460
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,918
MARTHA YOU WERE IN IRAN WHEN 

461
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,255
THIS DEAL WAS REACHED.

462
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,159
IT DOESN'T APPEAR THE PRESIDENT 

463
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,294
WENT FAR TO LABEL THEM AS A 

464
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,729
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

465
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,298
THAT IS WHAT THE IRANIAN REGIME 

466
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,266
IS LIKELY TO BE OPPOSED TO. 

467
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:36,401
>> THAT'S RIGHT GEORGE.

468
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,804
THE DESERT IF I INDICATION THEY 

469
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,205
WERE EXPECTING.

470
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,406
THEY'LL THINK THAT BREAK IT IS 

471
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,940
SPIRIT OF THE DEAL FROM THEIR 

472
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,241
EYES.

473
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,945
AS FOR THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION 

474
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,481
NAR GUARD WE GOT REACTION BEFORE

475
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:49,981
THIS SPEECH.

476
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:51,616
THEY READ ABOUT POSSIBLY WHAT 

477
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,352
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS GOING TO SAY

478
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,520
TODAY.

479
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,790
THE FOREIGN MINISTER INDUSTRY 

480
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,826
SPOKESMAN SAID ANY MOVE AGAINST 

481
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,529
THE IRANIAN FORCES WILL LEAD TO 

482
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:10,001
AN EQUAL AND SEVERE REACTION BY 

483
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:14,840
THE ISLAMIC OF IRAN. 

484
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,876
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE REACHED

485
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,411
THIS CONCLUSION AFTER 

486
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,612
CONSULTATION OF THE AL PLIES BUT

487
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,849
THE ALLIES OPPOSED. 

488
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:26,718
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

489
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:30,155
UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, GERM, 

490
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:34,593
RUSSIA AND CHINA ARE ALL UNITED.

491
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,028
THEY SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

492
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:40,198
WRONG AND IRAN IS ABIDING BY THE

493
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:40,398
DEAL.

494
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:42,700
THE PRESIDENT HAS ISOLATED THE 

495
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,903
UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO 

496
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,271
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

497
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:51,543
THEY'LL GO FORWARD TRADING WITH 

498
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:51,743
IRAN.

499
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,677
THE LIKELIHOOD IF EVENTUALLY THE

500
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,313
UNITED STATES GETS OUT OF THIS 

501
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,915
DEAL PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD 

502
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,684
CONVINCE THESE ALLIES TO SLAP 

503
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:03,522
SANCTION BS ON IRAN IS VERY VERY

504
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:03,722
SLIM.

505
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,890
HE'S SET THE UNITED STATES 

506
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,392
AGAINST OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. 

507
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,228
>> I WANT TO GO TO CONGRESS, 

508
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,397
MARY BRUCE, THE PRESIDENT 

509
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,865
SENDING THIS TO CONGRESS TO SEE 

510
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:18,103
IF THEY'LL IMPOSE THESE NEW 

511
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:18,370
SANCTIONS.

512
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,637
NOT SOMETHING MOST IN CONGRESS 

513
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:21,373
WANT TO DEAL WITH NOW. 

514
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,608
>> EVEN REPUBLICANS WHO OPPOSED 

515
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,809
THIS DEAL DON'T WANT TO ATTACK 

516
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,044
IT NOW.

517
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,545
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED THERE 

518
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:31,783
ARE PROPOSALS TO AMEND THE DEAL,

519
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,919
MAYBE PUT IN PLACE TOUGHER 

520
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,186
SANCTIONS.

521
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,088
THERE'S VERY LITTLE APPETITE ON 

522
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:39,591
CAPITOL HILL TO REIMPOSE THE 

523
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,592
NUCLEAR SANCTIONS.

524
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,627
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY IF 

525
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,062
CONGRESS CAN'T REACH AN 

526
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,264
AGREEMENT HE WILL TERMINATE THIS

527
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:51,269
DEAL, THIS AIDES TO CONGRESS' 

528
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:51,702
DAUNTING TO DO LIST.

529
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:53,238
THEY WANT TO TACKLE TAX REFORM 

530
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,942
AND PASS THE PROTECTIONS FOR 

531
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,209
DROOEMERS.

532
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,611
WE ADDED UP THE MAP HERE.

533
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,779
THE SENATE HAS 34 WORKING DAYS 

534
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:02,280
LEFT.

535
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,851
IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW IT WILL GET

536
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:07,051
DONE. 

537
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:08,353
>> LET'S GO BACK TO JON KARL.

538
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,687
CONGRESS DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL 

539
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,288
WITH IT.

540
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:14,559
THE ALLIES DON'T AGREE WITH THE 

541
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,293
PRESIDENT.

542
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,895
IRAN UNCLEAR WHAT IT WILL DO.

543
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,730
HARD TO KNOW IF IT GETS TO WHERE

544
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,732
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE'LL HAVE TO

545
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,967
CANCEL THE DEAL. 

546
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:26,638
>> I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT EVEN

547
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,072
AS THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING 

548
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:30,575
TOUGH THINGS AROUND IRAN HE 

549
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,276
TALKED ABOUT FIXING THE FLAWS IN

550
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:32,878
THE DEAL.

551
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,479
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT RIPPING IT 

552
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,048
OUT OR GETTING OUT OF IT.

553
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,716
HE STOPPED FAR SHORT OF WHAT HE
