>>DONALD TRUMP IS A
MEGALOMANIAC AND BELIEVES THAT
HE SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR THINGS
AS TRIVIAL AS THE WORD FAKE, HE
LITERALLY SAID IN AN INTERVIEW
ONCE THAT HE INVENTED THE WORD
FAKE, HE SAID IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AROUND BEFORE BUT I MADE IT
POPULAR.
NOW HE IS TAKING CREDIT
FOR CHRISTMAS.
HE LAUNCHED A
NUMBER OF TWEETS ALL WITH BIG,
BOLD LETTERS, SAYING MERRY
CHRISTMAS!
FIRST OF ALL, GOD
BLESS, THAT'S FANTASTIC, BLESS
YOUR HEART, DO 17 OF THOSE.
SO
FAR SO GOOD, THAT'S FINE.
YOU
KNOW THIS WILL TURN INTO THE WAR
ON CHRISTMAS SPIEL THAT O'REILLY
AND FOX NEWS STARTED AND OF
COURSE TRUMP IS JUMPING IN ON,
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO
TO THE VIDEO OF HIM TALKING
ABOUT CHRISTMAS AS WELL.
>>I WANTED TO WISH EVERYBODY A
VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS.
>>VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS, OKAY,
WE GOT IT.
HOW ABOUT ONE MORE?
>>WE SAY CHRISTMAS AGAIN VERY
PROUDLY, VERY, VERY MERRY
CHRISTMAS.
>>VERY, VERY, MERRY, MERRY
CHRISTMAS TO ALL OF YOU AND WE
SAY IT PROUDLY WEARS BEFORE WE
HUNG OUR HEAD IN SHAME AS WE
SAID MERRY CHRISTMAS?
I DON'T
REMEMBER THAT, NO ONE REMEMBERS
THAT IN AMERICA, BUT
HE'S NOT DONE YET.
HE GOES ON TO SAY IN A TWEET --
>>LET ME SEE, ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX OR SO
EXCLAMATION POINTS, I DON'T HAVE
MY GLASSES ON -- SO, I THINK HE
MAKES A GOOD POINT HERE AND I'M
CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL
THE POWs FROM THE WAR ON
CHRISTMAS, ALL THE PEOPLE WHO
NOT ONLY WERE IMPRISONED BY
OBAMA FOR SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS
BUT ALSO THOSE MISSING IN
ACTION, THOSE WHO SAID MERRY
HOLIDAYS AS A HALFWAY POINT, OR
PERHAPS HAPPY CHRISTMAS.
WHERE
ARE THEY?
CAN WE FREE THEM AS
WELL?
IF YOU BELIEVE THERE WAS
AN ACTUAL WAR ON CHRISTMAS, YOU
VERGED ON BEING A LUNATIC.
PEOPLE KEPT SAYING MERRY
CHRISTMAS THROUGHOUT, NO ONE
MADE IT ILLEGAL TO SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS, NO ONE EVEN THOUGHT
IT WAS A BAD THING TO SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS, NO PROGRESSIVE SAID
THAT, FOX NEWS MADE IT UP
COMPLETELY.
THE CONSERVATIVE
STANCE OF FORCING PEOPLE TO SAY
MERRY CHRISTMAS FIRST OF ALL
DOESN'T SEEM VERY MERRY, IT
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT FITS THE
HOLIDAY SPIRIT.
SECOND OF ALL IF
YOU ARE NOT CHRISTIAN, FOR
EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE JEWISH AND
THEY KEEP FORCING YOU TO SAY
MERRY CHRISTMAS, OKAY, THAT
COULD BECOME PROBLEMATIC.
I
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT
ANYWAY BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T
REALLY THAT OFFENDED BY IT.
BUT
NONETHELESS IT TAKES ON A
DIFFERENT RING OF ALL OF A
SUDDEN YOU GO FROM HEY, IT WOULD
BE NICE IF PEOPLE SAID HAPPY
HOLIDAYS, MERRY CHRISTMAS, NO
BIG DEAL, WHO CARES, TO WAIT A
MINUTE, YOU MUST SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS.
THAT'S BIZARRE, AND
IT'S ALSO POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.
IN FACT IT'S POLITICAL
CORRECTNESS 101.
YOU AREN'T
ALLOWED TO SAY THE THINGS YOU
NORMALLY SAY, YOU MUST SAY THE
THINGS THAT ARE NOW POLITICALLY
CORRECT, LIKE MERRY CHRISTMAS.
ONE THING WE KNOW, THOUGH, FROM
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE
LAST EIGHT YEARS CHRISTMAS HAS
BEEN BANNED SO IT'S KIND OF
WEIRD THAT THE OBAMAS ALSO PUT
OUT THIS TWEET, IT'S AS ON
BEHALF OF THE OBAMA FAMILY,
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT IS GOING ON?
AS HE TURNED
SIDES?
AND HE SAYS WE WISH YOU
JOY AND PEACE THIS HOLIDAY
SEASON, I WONDER WHAT HE MEANS
BY THAT.
ONE THING THAT WILL
DRIVE TRUMP CRAZY IS OBAMA'S
TWEET SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS GOT
AT LEAST SEVEN TIMES AS MUCH
ATTENTION AND LIKES, ETC., AS
DID DONALD TRUMP'S, THAT WILL
GET UNDER HIS SKIN AND THAT'S
FUN.
IF YOU ARE WONDERING IF
THIS IS A NEW TURN FOR OBAMA,
HE'S FINALLY SAYING MERRY
CHRISTMAS BECAUSE OF DONALD
TRUMP, WELL, IF YOU THINK THAT
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING AN
INTENTION, OF COURSE IT'S NOT
REMOTELY TRUE.
I WANT TO GIVE
CREDIT TO DANIEL REDMOND WHO ON
TWITTER PUT OUT A COMPILATION OF
PREVIOUS THINGS PRESIDENT
OBAMA SAID IN OFFICE.
>>HAVE A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS.
>>WE WANT TO SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS.
>>A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS AND
HOLIDAY FILLED WITH JOY.
>>I WANT TO WISH EVERY AMERICAN
A MERRY CHRISTMAS.
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY.
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS!
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE.
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY.
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY.
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY.
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS.
>>MERRY CHRISTMAS.
>>CREDIT TO MSNBC AS WELL.
THAT
WAS AWESOME.
IF YOU THOUGHT
OBAMA DIDN'T SAY MERRY
CHRISTMAS, YOU ARE NOT ONLY
WRONG, YOU HAVE BEEN DUPED AS
USUAL.
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A
WAR ON CHRISTMAS, IT'S
COMPLETELY INVENTED, AND ANYONE
WHO SAYS THAT IS REALLY KIND OF
PATHETIC.
THERE'S ONE PERSON WHO
IF IT EXISTS IS ALSO APPARENTLY
PART OF THIS WAR AND THIS ONE
HITS CLOSE TO HOME.
ALL MY GOD,
ET TU, IVANKA?
THAT SAYS HAPPY
HOLIDAYS, WE KNEW IVANKA
COULDN'T BE TRUSTED, OR PERHAPS
IT'S BECAUSE SHE CONVERTED TO
JUDAISM SO HAPPY HOLIDAYS MAKE
SENSE.
WILL HE FORCE HIS OWN
DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW AND
GRANDCHILDREN TO SAY CHRISTMAS?
I DON'T CARE WHAT RELIGION YOU
ARE IN, SAY CHRISTMAS!
INSANE.
BUT THERE'S ONE GUY WE KNOW WHO
HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE RIGHT
SIDE BECAUSE HE TELLS IT LIKE IT
IS, IT'S DONALD TRUMP, LET'S GO
TO A TWEET FROM DONALD TRUMP
FROM 2010.
WISHING EVERYONE A
VERY HAPPY HOLIDAY SEASON.
OH
NO, DONALD, NOT YOU TOO!
I'M
GLAD TO SEE THAT DONALD TRUMP
HAS ALSO ESCAPED FROM THE WAR ON
CHRISTMAS, APPARENTLY HE WAS A
HOSTAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND
IS NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
ISSUES.
OR PERHAPS THIS IS ALL A
LOAD OF HORSE CRAP AND MEANT TO
DIVIDE US AT A TIME WHERE WE ARE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE HOLIDAY CHEER,
AND SHOW KINDNESS TO ONE
ANOTHER.
