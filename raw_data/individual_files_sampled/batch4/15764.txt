another of our goals was to stop the council from protecting the world's worst human rights abusers what happened the council would not even have a meeting on the human rights conditions in Venezuela why because Venezuela is a member of the Human Rights Council as is Cuba as is China similarly the council failed to respond in December and January when the Iranian regime killed and arrested hundreds of citizens simply for expressing their views when a so called Human Rights Council cannot bring itself to address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member the council ceases to be worthy of its name that is the ambassador to the United Nations nikki Haley Donald Trump's ambassador explaining why the u.s. is pulling out of the UN Human Rights Council I couldn't help but think when I was listening to her saying well why didn't they investigate Venezuela because Venezuela is on the human rights commands made me think of Robert conquests third law of politics which is the best way to understand any bureaucracy is that it is being colonized by a cabal of its enemies and isn't that incredible the way she lists the violators of human rights that have actually infiltrated the Human Rights Council well that's not news to our next guest our friend Claudio rosette with the she's a foreign policy fellow for the Independent Women's Forum and she joins us now via Skype Claudia I know that you have known these things about the Human Rights Council for ages it's sort of exciting to see the UN ambassador from the United States say the same things isn't it oh it's refreshing it's bracing and you know something I think it's actually quite good worldwide for the cause of human rights I think so too now here's a question the United States has allies of different degrees of ardour do you think that this will spread to anyone else do you think any other countries that are more on the Democratic side of the spectrum will say yeah you know we're out of here too we don't need to give this place any dignity I certainly hope so although that's really not the record in fact one of the things that ambassador Haley mentioned in her carissa remarks along with Secretary of State Pompeo who also was really clear and terrific excellent on this is that America's allies who share our values refuse to stand up for them in public at the Human Rights Council behind closed doors they may agree but they won't they just sit there and go along with it she didn't actually name any individual countries but if you look down the list of members you'll find countries such as Germany the United Kingdom the countries that share our values but again America really fights this alone yeah and I think it's right to withdraw well I know the argument for staying in which is well if we're in we can have some influence if we're in we're part of the discussion if we're in we can maybe make some minor adjustments to their trajectory doesn't sound like that's working I I don't know I think it's I think there's a real peer pressure and it reminds me of other Donald Trump decisions like when Trump removed the United States from the Paris agreement on mobile warming and this was something oh you can't do that the earth will fall the sky will fall rather and nothing happens like Trump withdrew America from this UN process that's eat that makes the UN Human Rights Council look you know it's so dysfunctional the climate change panel it's so much larger too and nothing happened the sky didn't fall and I think that there's this peer pressure you can't leave these institutions no one's ever left these institutions well it's it's the jungle out there if we leave these institutions no you can leave these institutions and try something else and it's not going to be a calamity no in fact there's a huge vested interest by these worst abusers in many cases but the US remember the Human Rights Council is particularly bad at the UN it's a magnet for the worst abusers because they exploit it to try and actually warp the definition of human rights you get them arguing all sorts of things that are really out of Orwell and they try to then sort of institutionalize that under the UN and it got so bad it was previously the Commission on Human Rights she might remember which ended up being chaired by Libya's Gaddafi's Libya in 2003 and the u.s. finally said enough the UN actually agreed and said okay we'll reform this then they produced the current Human Rights Council the Bush administration said we're in fact with John Bolton as the Ambassador who was there for part of this said no we're not joining this it's going to turn into the same collection of abusers all the incentives are the same and didn't join President Obama then joined in 2009 and here we are finally thank goodness with President Trump saying no this isn't working the incremental bits the the occasional good moment is not worth effectively endorsing the complete perversion of any definition of human rights yeah well remember the last time I visited the United Nations building myself and I was shown this absolutely exquisite lounge that faced the river and it was it would have been like if those were condominiums they would have been like ten million dollars like the the that property is so amazing and it was the most luxurious room I think I've ever been in in my life and I'm trying to remember it was Qatar or the United Arab Emirates that had sponsored this room like it was a plaque Bach brought to you by I forget which OPEC dictatorship and what I learned then was in the past America says well we're footing the bill we get to call the shots but I realize now that if America pulls that like when when Donald Trump threatened to pull its funding away from the the PLO well that's nothing for some OPEC dictator to come in with 10 million a hundred million so it's not even the money anymore and that's that's another word though is that Trump could say well we're paying 3/4 the bill or a court of the bill would I don't think there's any shortage of bad guys that would take over and that would be the only one thing on my mind is if America were to pull out of certain things that the America would be replaced by an odious force does that apply here yeah and at the same time what America is also withdrawing is credibility you know if the UN even with its current budget we're operating out of say you know Novosibirsk Russia it simply wouldn't have the effect that it does today it's the u.s. backing I mean democracies carry credibility their legitimate governments and when we withdraw that that's important now we still find the base UN where even if we don't find they say the human rights council we're paying for the brand if you like we're paying billions we the u.s. billions every year to keep the entire enterprise going and attach to it or all these agencies we're whether we fund them or not they thrive on the UN label but when the US starts pulling out that says we're taking our business elsewhere you know we want to we want to promote human rights we're not going to do it through this complete charade and mockery at the United Nations I we we take away some of the legitimacy that is falsely attached to a thing an outfit like the Human Rights Council and I think that's although you are certainly correct yeah OPEC dictatorships sure they could afford to bankroll most UN agencies but what they want is the u.s. in there not only paying for it that's blessing it yeah you know what I'm a dream what would happen if the UN was actually physically moved from New York I mean I'm sure we want it in Moscow I'm sure you know any Gulf I'm sure they'd want to move it to Doha Qatar but I think taking it out of that wonderful City New York would knock it down prestige wise but that's we should rejoice in this one baby step today hey before we go I want to ask you a little bit about North Korea because you and I have talked about North Korea half a dozen times and we were so perplexed and we were so and I've talked to and Qiang about it too and we all thought it was such an intransigent insoluble problem and then look at Donald Trump and what he's done I don't want to I don't want to say that the deed is done but I want to ask you if you believe that what is happening so far is real enough that we can at least have half a candle of celebration I'm incredibly weary I don't think the kim jongmin has changed his ways and I don't think that his great concern is developing a thriving North Korea where people are free what I am hoping is that the real agenda here or the real effect will be a change of regime ideally kim jongmin just goes perhaps that he is forced in some way to alter things to an extent where it basically is regime change I think it would mean his downfall but one of the big I think there are pieces of the puzzle we may not be seeing and one of the big questions I have is did president Truong find a credible way to threaten Kim jong-un to such an extent I mean directly perhaps through some message perhaps through some set of targeting coordinates I don't know I'm guessing I'm asking that Kim jong-un has a real incentive to comply with some of this I don't think that Kim is going to cheerfully give up his entire nuclear arsenal and production facilities I do think there's a chance here of maneuvering in some way to basically bring him down and if that happens we have the real real start of a solution yeah you know we throw one thing at you I mean Donald Trump is criticized certainly by the left and even some on the right for his style his his braggadocio his occasional vulgarity and there's a theory out there and some say with respect some say with a grudging respect he's such a bruiser Trump and he comes from New York real estate where you're dealing with unions and corrupt regulators and sometimes even in the past I guess the Mafia you're it's such a it's such a voracious rapacious world then maybe his battle scars and his bully style that people criticize maybe that's he's the first guy who has the temperament to take on a Kim and I mean the thing about Trump is you flick his nose he flicks you back 10 times harder as our own Justin Trudeau is discovering and so maybe it takes the biggest baddest bragging is bully around to finally know how to deal with Kim maybe I'm saying the obvious here but I think it takes I think a guy who's a nice guy like George W Bush was and I think Obama sometimes was I don't think they had a chance maybe it takes a killer like Trump I'm using that fragment as metaphorically what do you think of that oh I think so in fact I wondered was this sort of the godfather summit I sit down in which a threat had been issued when President Trump said we understand each other was he sort of talked the way the Godfather would you know we understand each other because we left a horse head in his bed before he came to have his chocolate cake but but we don't know we're really guessing on a lot of this the thing I see is that it's I have thought for years that it's very likely but the only real solution to North Korea requires military action no American president wants to do that there's no appetite for another war in Korea so they default to trying what they can with diplomacy and what you just described with President Trump style I think has a far better chance at succeeding and all the polished refined Ivy League fancy diplomats who have paraded through the negotiations with North Korea over decades unveiled catastrophic Lee I just think there's any person in the world who's older than like maybe grade two that John Kerry has ever scared like secretary John like who would be afraid of John Kerry other than a problem and yeah where's Donald Trump I think I think he could scare someone and I'm we're all sort of counting on that well we'll keep in touch with you on this too but it was nice to have a little bit of a victory to talk about together namely nikki Haley pulling out of the UN Human Rights Council so it's great to talk to you about that and I just have to throw in some North Korea question it's nice to see again Claudia I appreciate your time today great to see you thanks that's right you too well there you have a Claudia rosettes a lot going on in foreign affairs and Donald Trump is certainly at the center of all with that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a
