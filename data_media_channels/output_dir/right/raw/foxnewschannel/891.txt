1
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:13,016
SPEAK TO THE REPORT YESTERDAY

2
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:13,750
MORE THAN MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,887
ANYTHING TOTALLY EXONERATES ME.

4
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:17,521
THE END RESULT WAS WRONG.

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,489
IF THERE WAS TOTAL BIAS, WHEN

6
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:20,190
YOU LOOK AT PETER STRZOK AND

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,860
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ME AND WHEN

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,129
YOU LOOK AT COMEY, SO IT WAS A

9
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,331
PRETTY GOOD REPORT BUT I WOULD

10
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:30,267
SAY THE IG BLEWETT AT THE END

11
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:30,834
WITH THAT STATEMENT.

12
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:31,868
PETER STRZOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN

13
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:33,170
FIRED A LONG TIME AGO AND OTHERS

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,873
SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED.

15
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,475
THE TOP PEOPLE WERE HORRIBLE.

16
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:40,811
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED,

17
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:42,079
THEY WERE PLOTTING AGAINST MY

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,446
ELECTION.

19
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:43,914
>> OF THIS REPORT CONTAINS NO

20
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:45,682
EVIDENCE TO MAKE ANY REASONABLE

21
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:46,984
PERSON CONCLUDE THAT THE SPECIAL

22
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,685
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION IS

23
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:51,121
ANYTHING OTHER THAN INDEPENDENT,

24
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,055
IMPARTIAL, AND JUST AS IMPORTANT

25
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:54,191
TODAY AS IT WAS BEFORE THIS

26
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:58,095
REPORT WAS ISSUED.

27
00:00:58,095 --> 00:00:59,329
>> Bret: IT WAS SURREAL, THE

28
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,131
PRESIDENT WALKING OUT ON THE

29
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:02,065
NORTH LAWN.

30
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,467
INTERVIEW LIVE ON

31
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:04,434
"FOX & FRIENDS" AND HOLDING A

32
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:05,102
GAGGLE WITH THE PRESS.

33
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:07,537
AND THAT'S A FIRST TIME THAT HAS

34
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:08,305
EVER HAPPENED WITH THE PRESIDENT

35
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,007
OF THE UNITED STATES AND HE MADE

36
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:11,308
A LOT OF NEWS TODAY.

37
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:13,610
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL.

38
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,346
JOINING ME HERE AT SHINNECOCK

39
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:21,284
HILLS, JIM HAMMER,

40
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:22,686
MELISSA FRANCIS, AND IN

41
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,254
WASHINGTON, MOLLIE HEMINGWAY,

42
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:26,089
AND IN NEW YORK, BILL

43
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:26,656
McGOVERN, MAIN STREET

44
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:28,592
COLUMNIST FOR THE WALL STREET

45
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:33,163
DURING YOUR

46
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:33,797
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL."

47
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:34,998
SO THAT HAPPENED DURING YOUR

48
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:37,034
HOUR AND CONTINUED INTO YOUR

49
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:38,668
HOUR.

50
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:40,003
HOW ABOUT YOUR INSIGHT?

51
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:43,840
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS REMARKABLE.

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,244
IT WAS MY SENSE, WHEN HE BECAME

53
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:49,379
PRESIDENT, THAT HE WAS THE ONE

54
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,714
WHO IS GOING TO RUN AS

55
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:52,282
COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT, THAT

56
00:01:52,282 --> 00:01:54,418
HE WAS GOING TO BE HIS PRESS

57
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:56,420
SECRETARY, NOT LITERALLY BUT

58
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,656
FIGURATIVELY AS COMMANDER IN

59
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:01,758
CHIEF.

60
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:02,559
AND MUELLER SORT OF TOOK THAT

61
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:06,797
BAG CLUB OUT OF HIS BAG, SO TO

62
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:07,264
SPEAK.

63
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:08,298
WITH THE ECONOMY MOVING THE WAY

64
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,300
IT IS, I THINK WITH THE

65
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,268
SINGAPORE SENATE BEHIND HIM AND

66
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:20,277
THE IG REPORT, AND, I BELIEVE HE

67
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:24,881
WOULD MUCH RATHER HOLD A PRESS

68
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:26,650
CONFERENCE ONCE A WEEK IF HIS

69
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,286
LAWYERS UP TO THIS POINT HAD

70
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:29,753
ALLOWED IT.

71
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:32,389
>> Bret: MOLLY, THERE IS A LOT

72
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:35,158
OF LOW-HANGING FRUIT IN THIS IG

73
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:38,061
REPORT IF YOU ARE A TRUMP

74
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:38,662
SUPPORTER.

75
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:41,064
I HAVE PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY WERE

76
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:41,832
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE

77
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:44,267
CHARACTERIZATION, THAT IT WAS A

78
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,269
NOTHING BURGER FROM THE START.

79
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,706
>> I HAVEN'T READ ALL 158 PAGES.

80
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:50,874
CHUCK SCHUMER IS WRONG ABOUT

81
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,076
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THIS REPORT,

82
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:56,413
IT WAS AN EXHAUSTIVE DETAILED

83
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:59,282
LOOK AT WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION,

84
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:02,953
BIAS, POOR JUDGMENT, BAD

85
00:03:02,953 --> 00:03:05,388
DECISION-MAKING.

86
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:07,257
THE SAME PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN

87
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:08,125
THE CLINTON PROBE AS WERE

88
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,894
INVOLVED IN WHAT HAS NOW BECOME

89
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:11,661
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL.

90
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:14,064
AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE

91
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,866
WERE SAYING, HOW THEY WERE

92
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:16,867
OPENLY CONSPIRING AGAINST THE

93
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:18,135
DONALD TRUMP ELECTION AND HOW

94
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,569
THEY WERE FANTASIZING ABOUT HIS

95
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,872
IMPEACHMENT AFTER THE ELECTION,

96
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:24,307
THAT REALLY CALLED INTO QUESTION

97
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,710
WHAT COULD HE CAME INTO THE

98
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,311
BASIS OF THE ENTIRE PROBE.

99
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,847
WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF TREASON

100
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:32,949
AND COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA AND A

101
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,218
LOT OF EVIDENCE OF THAT BEHAVIOR

102
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,453
BY THE FBI.

103
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:39,089
>> THE OTHER NEWS MADE TODAY WAS

104
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,056
ABOUT CHINA.

105
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:43,293
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT THE

106
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,995
PRESIDENT SAID AND CHINA'S

107
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:45,362
REACTION.

108
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:49,132
>> WE WILL DO $50 BILLION ON

109
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:50,100
$50 BILLION OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY

110
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,501
EQUIPMENT AND OTHER THINGS

111
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,904
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY BECAUSE

112
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:57,507
SO MUCH OF OUR SECRETS -- WE

113
00:03:57,507 --> 00:04:00,076
HAVE THE GREAT BRAINPOWER IN

114
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:01,411
SILICON VALLEY, AND CHINA AND

115
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:06,416
OTHERS STEAL THOSE THOSE.

116
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:10,053
>> WE WILL IMMEDIATELY RESPOND

117
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:12,689
AND TAKE NECESSARY MEASURES TO

118
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,192
DEFEND OUR IMMEDIATE RIGHTS AND

119
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:16,560
INTERESTS.

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,528
>> Bret: AND MELISSA, WHAT ARE

121
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:21,964
WE LOOKING AT HERE, IT IS AT

122
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,967
HEADING OUT TO THE TRADE WAR?

123
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,569
>> MARKETS WENT DOWN RIGHT AWAY

124
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,572
ON THIS NEWS AND AT THE END OF

125
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:30,440
THE DAY THEY CLAWED THEIR WAY

126
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,907
BACK.

127
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:31,841
THERE'S ONE THING TO KEEP IN

128
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,076
MIND WHEN WE ARE LISTENING TO

129
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:35,445
ALL THIS CHATTER ABOUT THE TRADE

130
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:36,079
WAR.

131
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,114
THERE WAS A MOMENT AT THE G7

132
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:40,083
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WHY

133
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,651
DON'T WE DROP ALL OF OUR TARIFFS

134
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:43,453
ON EVERYTHING IN IT IT WENT OVER

135
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:46,089
LIKE A LEAD BALLOON.

136
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,857
THAT'S WHERE HE HAD SAID TO COME

137
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:50,927
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT NO TARIFFS

138
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:51,461
ARE BEST.

139
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,096
FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS, IT'S

140
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:54,464
A TRUE FREE MARKET.

141
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:56,499
BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT FOR A

142
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,134
LONG TIME AND WE CONTINUE TO USE

143
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,903
BOTH THE CARROT AND STICK TO GET

144
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:02,239
CLOSER TO THAT.

145
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,506
BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH OF THE

146
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,508
MATTER AND WHEN HE SAID THAT IT

147
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:07,110
WAS REVEALED THAT HE DOESN'T

148
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,511
BELIEVE IN TARIFFS BUT HE ALSO

149
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:10,714
KNOWS IT WILL TAKE A LOT TO PUSH

150
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:12,882
OTHER COUNTRIES THERE.

151
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,552
>> Bret: BILL, HOW DOES THAT

152
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:17,487
PLAY ON MAIN STREET?

153
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,289
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FEW

154
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:20,490
MORE KARATS RATHER THAN THE

155
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,525
STICKS.

156
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:23,927
I WAS ALSO HARDENED BY THE NO

157
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,495
TARIFFS CALL THE PRESIDENT MADE,

158
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:28,265
BUT IF YOU WERE SERIOUS ABOUT

159
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:32,202
THAT, I THINK WHAT HE SHOULD

160
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:36,206
DO -- NEGOTIATE WITH A PARTNER

161
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:37,707
LIKE BRITAIN OR EVEN CANADA,

162
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:40,110
FIND A PARTNER THAT HAS VERY FEW

163
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,712
TRADE ISSUES WITH US.

164
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:44,247
NEGOTIATE THE IDEAL BILATERAL

165
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,949
AND THEN SAY, THIS DEAL IS OPEN

166
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,084
TO ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS THE

167
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:48,485
SAME TERMS.

168
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:50,720
I THINK THAT IS A MORE EFFECTIVE

169
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,922
WAY OF DOING IT AND IT'S MORE

170
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,924
WITH THE CARROT AND THE STICK.

171
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:56,126
>> Bret: LET'S TALK

172
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:56,926
IMMIGRATION.

173
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:59,296
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID

174
00:05:59,296 --> 00:05:59,929
ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING.

175
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,699
>> I'M LOOKING AT BOTH OF THEM.

176
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,267
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED

177
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:04,567
THEM.

178
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,636
I NEED A BILL THAT GIVES THIS

179
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:08,571
COUNTRY TREMENDOUS BORDER

180
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,907
SECURITY, I HAVE TO HAVE THAT.

181
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:12,142
>> DOES THAT MEAN THE WALL?

182
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,577
>> IF THERE IS NO WALL, THERE IS

183
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:15,312
NO BILL.

184
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:18,315
>> WE ARE WAITING FOR THE

185
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:19,549
PRESIDENT TO CLARIFY HIS

186
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:19,916
COMMENTS.

187
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,685
>> THE PRESIDENT ASKED THIS

188
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:22,552
HOUSE TO ACT.

189
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:24,554
EVERYBODY SAID TO THE PUBLIC, WE

190
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,122
WANT TO WORK IN A BIPARTISAN

191
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:27,090
WAY.

192
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,358
WELL, YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

193
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:29,192
TO DO IT.

194
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:33,063
AND YOU HAVE RETREATED.

195
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:34,397
>> Bret: THERE IS SOME HEART

196
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:35,265
FAILURE ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY

197
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,433
AND THE WHITE HOUSE PUT OUT A

198
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:40,070
STATEMENT THIS AFTERNOON.

199
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,071
THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTS BOTH

200
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:43,039
BILLS AND IN THIS MORNING'S

201
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,574
INTERVIEW HE WAS COMMENTING ON

202
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:45,975
THE DISK CHARGE POSITION IN THE

203
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:48,278
HOUSE, NOT THE PACKAGE.

204
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:50,914
SO STRAIGHTENING THAT OUT, IT IS

205
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:51,281
IMPORTANT.

206
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,883
>> I HAVE HALF AN EYE ON A A

207
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:54,884
MIDTERM ELECTION THAT IS FIVE

208
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:56,353
MONTHS FROM NOW AND IT'S MY

209
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,288
SENSE THAT NONE OF THIS MOVES

210
00:06:58,288 --> 00:06:59,089
UNTIL THEN.

211
00:06:59,089 --> 00:06:59,989
PERHAPS DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME

212
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:01,858
IN NOVEMBER, WE GET MORE

213
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:02,492
MOVEMENT ON THIS.

214
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:05,095
I THINK THE TALK RIGHT NOW IS

215
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:08,732
JUST THAT.

216
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:11,868
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT BALANCE OF

217
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:12,669
POWER.

218
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,705
I THINK THAT'S WHERE THIS

219
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:16,172
ATTENTION IS.

220
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,707
>> HE SAID THE MODERATE BILL

221
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:20,076
WOULD MAKE SENSE SO WHY GIVE UP

222
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:20,477
LEVERAGE?

223
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:21,244
WALK BACK FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

224
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:22,812
WAS CURIOUS AND THEY ARE SAYING

225
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:25,949
THAT THIS DOES HAVE THE THE FOUR

226
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,318
PILLARS THAT TRUMP SOUGHT BUT IT

227
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:30,587
DOESN'T WATER DOWN CHAIN

228
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:34,691
MIGRATION, AND IT ALSO EXPANDS

229
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:37,026
AMNESTIES IN A WAY THAT IS

230
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:40,096
REALLY DANGEROUS, IN A MUCH

231
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:41,631
WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHILDREN OF

232
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,933
FOREIGN WORKERS WILL BE ABLE TO

233
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:44,701
APPLY FOR AMNESTY.

234
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,702
THAT'S AN UNCONTROLLED PROGRAM

235
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:47,070
AND I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE

236
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,105
SHOULD LOOK A LOT ABOUT WHY THEY

237
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:50,473
ARE REALLY TRULY ONBOARD WITH

238
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:52,108
THIS, OR WHETHER THEY ARE GIVING

239
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,878
UP WAY TOO MUCH AND LOSING THEIR

240
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:55,245
LEVERAGE.

241
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:57,180
>> BOTH SIDES ARE SAYING, THE

242
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,415
OTHER SIDE IS PREVENTING THEM

243
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:01,217
FROM GETTING BILL DOWN I BILL

244
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:02,752
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

245
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:05,522
IT SEEMS LIKE IT MAY PUSH PAST

246
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:17,634
ELECTION DAY.

247
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:35,118
>> I THINK THAT HAS BEEN THE

248
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:35,452
HISTORY.

249
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:36,152
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER, I

250
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:36,852
WAS IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

251
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:37,520
WITH A BIPARTISAN DEAL FELL

252
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:37,821
APART.

253
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:38,388
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET

254
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:39,121
IMMIGRATION THROUGH AND I THINK

255
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:39,823
SOME PEOPLE WOULD RATHER HAVE

256
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:40,557
THE ISSUES AND HAVE IT RESOLVED.

257
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,256
THERE SHOULD BE A PRETTY EASY

258
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:41,857
PATH AT LEAST ON DACA OR

259
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:42,592
SOMETHING TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT

260
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:43,293
HIS WALL, WHICH HE WON'T BACK

261
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,027
DOWN ON, IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME OF

262
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:44,761
THE THINGS THAT DEMOCRATS WANT.

263
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:45,462
>> LAST THING, WHERE WE BEGAN.

264
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,262
HE TOOK OVER THE NEWS CYCLE, HE

265
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:48,465
OWNED THE DAY BY THAT HOUR ON

266
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:49,299
THE NORTH LAWN.

267
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,901
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY OTHER

268
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,102
PRESIDENT DOING THAT?

269
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:55,905
YOU MADE THE POINT EARLIER TODAY

270
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:56,573
THAT IT HASN'T HAPPENED.

271
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,341
YOU SAID IT'S THE KIND OF

272
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:02,212
PRESIDENCY WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE,

273
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:06,249
AND THEY LOOK LIKE A FRENZIED

274
00:09:06,249 --> 00:00:00,000
TEAM OF, I DON'T KNOW WHAT,
