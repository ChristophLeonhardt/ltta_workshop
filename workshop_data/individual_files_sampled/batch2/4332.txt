as I look at this document that I'm holding here there are a lot of redactions here you've had a chance to go through it a bit what can you tell us yeah just starting to look through it this is a 10 page memo 7 pages really of substance here a lot of footnotes a lot of a lot of evidence that's being cited by the Democrats in their response to the Nunez memo the key point is not surprising what the noonas with the shift' memo I should say starts by pointing out is that the Nunez memo itself was part of an effort to undermine the Department of Justice the FBI and the Moller investigation that this is an effort on the part of Republicans to sort of muddy the political waters as it were what the memo also states is that the FBI in seeking a surveillance warrant on Carter page for a former trump foreign policy adviser they met the full evidentiary standard that they need to meet in order to obtain that surveillance warrant and that the Christopher Steele dossier the infamous dossier that was a part of a political operation political research document funded by the Clinton campaign was was not a critical part it was only part of the information presented to the FISA Court and that the FISA warrant could have been issued even without it which was the core claim that the Nunez memo had made just a couple points that the shift' memo says I just want to read on screen here it says that the DOJ met the rigor transparency and evidentiary basis to meet Pfizer's probable cause requirement by demonstrating contemporaneous evidence of Russians election interference concerning Russian links and outreach to trump campaign officials and pages history with Russian intelligence there's also a redacted portion here in their key bullet points but that it refers to pages suspicious activities in 2016 including a trip to Moscow what's interesting about it is that the House Intelligence Committee interviewed Carter page as in the course of their investigation which has now been going on for nearly a year and Carter page told the committee himself about multiple trips that he took to Moscow not just in 2016 and in the summer but also after the election and also his past contacts with Russian key Russian officials so the committee itself was was well aware of elements of Carter pages history that would have certainly raised concerns at the Justice Department which would have been probable cause as the shift' memo argues here for a FISA warrant on him and so we'll continue to read this but basically it's it's not surprising the point that Democrats are making here the bottom line being that there was sufficient evidence beyond this this famous dossier now that Republicans have long sought to discredit here to obtain this warrant on Carter page and we'll we'll get back to you as we continue to dig through this all right Mike thank you for that I want to turn back to Frank Jill and Kimberly you've been listening to what Mike said here that he's been able to unpack on this memo Jill what are your thoughts what's your reaction to what we've heard so far well my thoughts are one that the memo to begin with the noonas memo was cherry-picked and was a big nothin burger it did not accomplish what was supposed to be accomplished it did not clear Trump it did not show that there was no evidence of the political nature of the steel dossier to the extent that it was even a part of the basis for the FISA warrant that dossier was identified in a footnote in the warrant as being from a political source so the cherry-pick nature and the falsity of noonas memo really made that a big nothing I also want to go back to a question you asked Frank which was why maybe manna for it would be more afraid of the Russians than gates and I'm not suggesting that gates shouldn't be a little bit afraid but his role was not so directly with the Ukrainians and the Russians which was manna forts role he was sort of the doer back here he would get instructions by email or otherwise from mana fort to falsify documents etc he even had to involve his own family man afford involved his own family in lying for him so a lot of this may be that his direct knowledge comes from manna fort and this is pressure on manna fort by getting the flip from gates now manna fort may have to know that he is going to go away for what could be the rest of his life given how many charges there are against him and Frank it does seem as though this them the Democrats a memo tries to say that the FBI the the FISA courts these folks were operating the way that they should every was on the up-and-up to the contrary of what they implied the Nunez memo said what's your read on what we've heard so far so look I'm pleased that it was released and it's sounding so far like it is what we thought it would be which is a refutation of the Nunez memo which is Jill said really and Jill was overly kind quite frankly I'm gonna go ahead and said that say the Munez memo was was a distortion of the facts at best an outright distortion so if you've been through the FISA Court process and I I've appeared before flights to court over 20 times in my career signed off on hundreds of FISA Court requests you know the process it's loaded with attorney review at DOJ at FBI in the local field office it doesn't get through the system without being proper and containing probable cause so it sounds like we have a refutation of the núñez memo and now the public gets to read this and decide what what they will alright I want you guys to listen to something I think we just were able to turn around some sound here Devon Nunez at the CPAC convention just outside DC commenting on this new memo release listen we actually wanted this out so this has been held up for over two weeks the FBI and DOJ had right away had told the Democrats what was wrong with their memo or their response to our memo and they waited for two weeks before they actually did the redactions that were necessary to get this out we wanted it out we want it out because we think it is clear evidence that the Democrats are not only trying to cover this up but they're also colluding with parts of the government to help cover this up and I think as you read it you will see personal attacks on myself personal attacks on chairman Gowdy with a lot of a lot of really interesting things that sound really bad like a lot that has been happening with this Russia investigation over the course of last year but what you're not going to see is anything that actually rejects what was in our memo I want to bring in Ned price now MSNBC national security analyst former special assistant to President Obama and former National Security Council spokesman Ned just your reaction to what we've heard so far but we just heard from Devon Nunez well we're still making our way through the through the shift memo but I think it is exactly what we expected it to be and that is a point-by-point refutation of the new Ness memo it's not as though the Nunez memo needed a refutation because it that the best rebuttal to the Nunez memo was in fact the Nunez memo but this lays out in about ten or eleven very clear concise pages exactly where the newness memo aired and my reading of this the most important takeaway here is the fact that the Democrats contend the steel dossier was not in any way used to as a predicate for the July 2016 launch of the investigation into the Trump campaign it was in fact the information that George papadopolis provided to the Australian ambassador in London but it was not until seven weeks later that the FBI actually obtained the steel memo so any notion that the steel dossier including its salacious allegations was at all the predicate for what has turned into the Special Counsel investigation has just been blown out of the water for anybody just joining us I want to reiterate that we are talking now about the Democrats response the Democrats memo from the House Intelligence Committee again we've been looking through it as I look at it here and hold it up here you can tell that there are a lot of redactions a lot of places here where information has been taken out by the White House let's go back to Mike mamooli who's been digging through this a little bit more for us this afternoon Mike what more can you add well you'll remember that there was this line at the end of the Nunez memo when it was released three weeks ago that Democrats were actually surprised to see which was the point made that in Nunez his own memo that the investigation into Trump's campaign and potential Russian involvement in contacts with Trump campaign officials had been underway well before that Carter page the surveillance was was launched what this shift memo specifies was that that investigation was launched by the FBI in on July 31st of 2016 I don't know that we've had a specific date on that investigation being launched the page application before the FISA Court was not made until October the other points that that shifts memo makes is that the DOJ subsided multiple sources in seeking in seeking this FISA warrant on Carter page and that it made only quote narrow use of information from the steel dossier Republicans have really tried to argue that the steel dossier was a primary source of launching the entire Russia investigation what shifts memo was saying it was only narrowly used in one fives application here on Carter page the other point that's made which is something that we want to I think continue to read more on as we go through this memo is that the FBI is interest in seeking this 5s application on Carter page sprang from what George papadopolis was able to tell them as they began speaking with him which is that Russian officials really began to express an interest in members of trumps foreign policy team developing contacts with them as perhaps a way into understanding more about the Trump campaign gaining influence in Trump's campaign that's a very important point here because it's what is what the shiffman's memo is pointing out here is that this is more than just an isolated seeking of a warrant on somebody close to the key that a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign but that they were able to see here a real pattern on the part of Russians to target individual members of his foreign policy team the other point which is interesting we are we have we have had some indications that there were did these initial FISA warrant application and the three renewals that we knew occurred after the fact were approved by Republican appointed judges what this memo states specifically is that just that fact this it just confirms what we had been led to believe which is that the judges who approved both the initial FISA warrant on Carter page and the renewals of those were appointed by Republican presidents two of whom were appointed by George W Bush one by President Reagan and the last point which the that I've been able to catch up here a little bit more on is that what the ship memo outlines is that the FISA warrant here on Carter page was not an attempt to spy on the Trump campaign itself but that they were specifically interested in Carter page learning more about the context that he would have had with Russian officials and what's significant as I pointed out when I spoke to you just a few moments ago Carter Paige told the Intelligence Committee himself that is it during the time in which the FISA Court would have been what this warrant would have been on him he traveled to Russia and he admitted to the committee that he was meeting with key Russian officials and so there certainly would have been evidence to both initially seek this application but also to renew it based on what Carter Paige himself told the committee and Mike I don't know if you were able to hear the sound we ran a second ago from Devon Nunez I just wanted to get your thoughts about what he said essentially saying that he wanted the memo the Democrats memo put out there and that he expected that it would would counter what his memo said and that it would be event a you know an option of a way for the public to see that that the Republican memo was accurate and truthful the Democrats the opposite yeah I think what's the interesting point here is that Democrats have said repeatedly that they didn't want either one of these memos to be released when when the committee launched the the Nunez memo Democrats fought that party line and then Republicans ultimately did sign on to release the shift memo they had a three-week head start here on framing the narrative that Democrats are only now seeking to address all right Mike thank you for that we're gonna take a quick break here we've
