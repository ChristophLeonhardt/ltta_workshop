We were soldiers doing what
we were instructed to do.
This is Bruce Jessen, a
former military psychologist
who became a CIA contractor, and
his colleague, James Mitchell.
Any expertise in the
art of interview?
My god, I'm a
clinical psychologist.
Interviews are what we do.
They've been described as the
architects of the extremely
harsh interrogation program
used at secret CIA prisons
after 9/11.
Jim and I went into
a cubicle, sat down.
He sat down at the typewriter.
And together, we rolled
out and typed up the list
that I've seen in the documents
here that was submitted.
They're now defendants
in a case brought
by some of the men
tortured in those prisons--
Suleiman Salim, Mohamed
Ben Soud, and Obaidullah,
the nephew of Gul Rahman,
who died in custody.
This is the first time that
Mitchell and Jessen are facing
lawyers for former detainees.
We exclusively obtained
video depositions
from the case,
which is scheduled
for trial in September.
Watch throughout as
Mitchell and Jessen
attempt to defend
themselves, both rhetorically
and emotionally.
If I want to get
information from you, Dror,
I don't want to slap you.
I don't want to wall you.
I don't want to waterboard
you, even if you're my enemy.
Jessen, who's never spoken
publicly about his role,
at times appears to
wrestle with what happened,
whereas Mitchell, who wrote
a book about his experiences,
comes off as more
polished and assertive.
I disagree with the suggestion
that we were architects,
because we weren't breaking
new ground in the sense that
architects do.
Mitchell and Jessen
didn't directly
interrogate the two surviving
men who brought this case,
but the methods
they proposed were
used on them and at
least 37 other men.
A fascinating aspect
of these videos
is how their accounts of
enhanced interrogation
dramatically differ from
what the detainees describe.
I'm a pretty good judge of
what it's like to be walled.
And--
I remember also them
putting a cloth around--
tying a cloth around
my neck, and then they
are punching me on the wall.
Oh, it's discombobulating.
It's not painful.
My guess would be that some
of the folks sitting here
have been walled.
It stirs up your inner ears.
And it's like being on one of
those whirlygigs or something.
You move around quite a bit.
And in fact, if it's painful,
you're doing it wrong.
There is a tether anchored
to the ceiling in the center
of the detention cell.
The detainee has
handcuffs, and they're
attached to the tether in
a way that they can't lie
down or rest against the wall.
They're monitored to make sure
they don't get edema if they
hang on the cuffs too much.
Holding so-called stress
positions for hours
was another technique
used on detainees.
I remember being tied on the
wall, handcuffed on the wall,
and I couldn't go
up or come down.
This is Jose Rodriguez,
former head of the CIA's
Counterterrorism Center.
On "60 Minutes,"
where you analogized
the stress positions to
working out in a gym.
Correct.
Do you think that's
a good analogy
to the kind of discomfort that
the stress positions caused?
I can only imagine.
So you don't know is the answer.
I don't know.
I can't describe
how painful it was.
Do you presently
experience the pain?
Yes.
Can you describe for me the
pain that you feel presently?
Maybe I'll need to tie
you here for one hour
so you can feel the pain if
you want to know the pain.
We can take a break.
We can take a break.
In this next section,
we hear Mitchell
talk in almost casual terms
about simulated drowning,
which the U.S. had long
considered torture.
The plaintiffs in
this case were not
subjected to this technique,
but other detainees were.
You thought waterboarding
was a bad thing,
was a painful thing, right?
No, I thought it
could be done safely.
I thought he would
be uncomfortable.
It sucks.
I don't know that it's painful.
But it's distressing.
I saw an interview with you
where you said between somebody
breaking their leg and
somebody being waterboarded,
most people would choose
to have their leg broken.
Do you remember saying
that in an interview?
No.
OK.
Now, you're using
the word "painful."
I'm using the word
"distressing."
The two things are not
synonymous in my mind.
The pressure is designed
to be used in a way
that it doesn't harm, but it
makes someone uncomfortable.
And they're more
irritating than painful.
This entire case, really,
gets to the question
of personal responsibility
within a larger system.
If you feel the
government is pressing
you to cross boundaries, to
what extent should you resist?
We also didn't want
to use waterboarding.
We ended up in a
video conference
with Jose Rodriguez
and a bunch of folks.
And prior to that,
Bruce and I had
said we're not going
to continue doing this.
And what they said was, well,
you guys have lost your spine.
They kept telling me every
day a nuclear bomb was
going to be exploded
in the United States,
and that because I told him
to stop, I had lost my nerve,
and it was going to be my
fault if I didn't continue.
I think the word that
was actually used
is that you guys are pussies.
There's going to be
another attack in America,
and the blood of dead civilians
is going to be on your hands.
If you won't follow
through with this,
then we're going to send
somebody out there who will.
Because we worked for them,
and they wanted it continued.
Justice Department lawyers
approved the techniques.
Based in part on what
Mitchell and Jessen told them,
they concluded
that the techniques
would cause no lasting harm.
And by their
reasoning, that meant
they wouldn't amount to torture.
Do you think that the enhanced
interrogation techniques
could result in long-term harm?
No.
Why is that?
It never did.
I don't know that for a fact.
It's one of those things
that you can establish.
If they're out there
and that happened,
then show me the data.
I think none of the
men that I was involved
with while I was involved
with them experienced anything
that would have led to that.
I'm very convinced of that.
Have you suffered any
psychological injuries
as a result of your
captivity in Cobalt?
Of course.
What are they?
Nightmares.
Can you tell me about
these nightmares?
It comes to me during my
sleep, and as if I'm still
in prison in that horrible
place and shackled.
In addition to
recurring nightmares,
Mr. Ben Soud describes feelings
of anxiety, fear, and worry.
Salim also describes
ongoing effects.
When asked about his feelings
of isolation, he responds--
I don't feel like
being with people.
I like being by myself.
And I don't like walking
around to see people.
I feel like I'm so weakened,
I can't do anything.
Mitchell and Jessen
continued working
with the CIA for many years.
They set up a
contracting company,
and ultimately, they ran
many aspects of the CIA's
interrogation program.
For that work, their company
received $81 million.
In the end, whether or
not Mitchell and Jessen
or the former detainees
prevail in this case,
it's already had
a profound effect.
At a time when the
world still confronts
the threat of terrorism,
we now know much more
about a recent episode
in U.S. history.
