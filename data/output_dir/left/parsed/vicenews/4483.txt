the size of this part is enormous you've
got 8,000 boxes big build every single
day all the river bananas are happening
365 days of year
I'm ready baby the scale and speed at
which these bananas are cultivated
packed and shipped is only possible
because of the use of this one clone of
banana how do we get to rely so heavily
on just this one crow if you want to get
profit you have to put everything in a
monoculture because it's very easy to
manage the whole plantation but the only
problem is passing diseases agricultural
expert dr. Lewis Paco Sangre explained
that this is the problem with mono
cultures they're all susceptible to the
same diseases which can spread like
wildfire
