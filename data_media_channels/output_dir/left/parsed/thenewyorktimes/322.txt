I visualize what
it’s going to feel
like to stand out in the
arena and I force myself
to stay 100 percent
focused on my blades
and my body and my breath.
And the more that I can
dive into the moment,
the slower it seems
like the time is going.
I can feel the crowd
getting more excited.
Inevitably, there are times when
I am actually picturing myself
making mistakes or falling.
And I have this
little voice saying
that it’s happened before.
It could happen again.
I just continue to breathe.
I watch Zach.
Every time that something goes
wrong in my head and every time
I get distracted by that,
I make myself start over.
Maybe it takes me
an hour or two hours
to get through the full
program from start to finish,
visualizing it the way that
I want, but by the end,
I have the feeling that
I’m more in control.
In my mind, I’m
just putting myself
in a place of commitment.
We breathe together before.
I try to make everything
tactile so that I’m fully
aware of my body and hers.
Right before the warm
up, I’m in the locker
room tying my skates, and
everything becomes hyper aware.
And I know that I’ve tied
my skates a million times,
and yet my feet feel different,
or it doesn’t feel quite right.
I have so much energy going
through my arms and legs.
I just need to keep moving.
I try and take everything in,
and the crowd, the scores,
and all this other stuff,
and I just kind of try
to turn it into a blur.
I don’t try to think
of anything else.
It’s just be.
You can’t control.
You have to be in the moment.
You have to live in the moment.
The tighter you squeeze
a fistful of sand,
the more it falls out.
And then they call our
name, and there’s no choice.
You just have to go and
do what you’ve practiced
to do for the last 12 months.
