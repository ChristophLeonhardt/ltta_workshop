HERE IN THE UNITED STATES?

37
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,883
I THINK WE WILL BE SORRY.

39
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,885
CRYSTAL BALL IN THIS CASE

40
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,020
BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK FIVE

41
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,388
YEARS LATER AT WHAT HAPPENED

42
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,023
IN COLORADO, FOR INSTANCE,

43
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,958

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,494
>> BY EVERY METRIC IT WAS A

47
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,129
FAILURE IN MY VIEW.

48
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,730
TEEN DRUG USE IS THE HIGHEST

49
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,768
IN THE COUNTRY:  TEEN DRUG

50
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:09,035
USE.

51
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,570
DRUG DRIVING IS OFF THE

52
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,837
CHARTS.

53
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,039
DOUBLED WITH MARIJUANA

54
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,173
IMPAIRED DRIVING.

55
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,875
HOMELESSNESS IS UP.

56
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,176
EMERGENCY ROOM ADMISSIONS.

57
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,180
AND THE BLACK MARKET IS

58
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,614
FLOURISHING.

59
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,049
BLACK MARKET ARREST REMEMBER

60
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,717
THE WHOLE NOTION IS WE

00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:25,851
LEGALIZE IT WE CAN CONTROL

62
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,420
IT BLACK MARKET ARRESTS ARE

63
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,822
UP ALMOST 400 PERCENT.

64
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:30,690
STEVE: MICHAEL, YOU ARE

65
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,291

68
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,528
>> YES.

69
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:36,195
STEVE: YOU HEARD WHAT HE

70
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:36,829
JUST SAID.

71
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,464
>> YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT

72
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:45,071
IT HAS TO BE REGULATED AND

73
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:45,838
HAVING MEDICAL MARIJUANA

74
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,640
BEING VERY HELPFUL

75
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,474
NATIONALLY AND

76
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:48,941
INTERNATIONALLY.

77
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,142
WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN

78
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,978

79
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,379
AND PARKISON'S AND WE SHOW A

80
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,714
LOT OF BENEFITS.

81
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,215
STEVE: MOST PEOPLE ARE FOR

82
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:56,816
MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

83
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,251
IT'S WHEN IT'S RECREATIONAL

84
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,886
THERE IS A POLL OUT SHOULD

85
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,154
MARIJUANA RECREATIONAL BE

86
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:02,455
LEGAL?

87
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,324
THIS WAS A PEW POLL.

88
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,058
62% SAY YES.

89
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,526
MAKE IT LEGAL.

90
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,227
34% SAY NO.

91
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,528
IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.

92
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,097
>> I THINK ULTIMATELY IT

93
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:11,964
WILL BE LEGAL.

94
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,699
BUT, AGAIN, IF IT'S

95
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,235
REGULATED PROPERLY SO PEOPLE

96
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,203
GET THE RIGHT PRODUCT.

97
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,904
YOU DON'T WANT MARIJUANA

98
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,072
LACED WITH FENTANYL AND SOME

99
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,908
OF THESE OTHER ISSUES.

100
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,409
STEVE: ABSOLUTELY.

101
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,043
>> THAT'S ONE WAY.

102
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,211
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

103
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,345
WE ARE IN THE THROW HE IS OF

104
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,414
AN OPIOID CRISIS.

105
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,749
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST BOLDLY

106
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,284
MOVED FORWARD WITH AN ENTIRE

107
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,353
NEW AGENDA FOCUSING ON

108
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,554
TREATMENT AND PRESCRIPTION

109
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,722
OF LEGAL OPIOIDS BECAUSE IT

110
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,658
LEADS TO ADDICTION.

111
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,127
WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE

112
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,262
INTRODUCE RECREATIONALLY A

113
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,864
BRAND NEW DRUG AND OPEN THE

114
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,132
FLOOD GATES, PARTICULARLY TO

115
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,401
YOUNG PEOPLE, AND BIG

116
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,002
TOBACCO WILL TAKE OVER, BIG

117
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,171
MARIJUANA WILL BE WHAT BIG

118
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,839
TOBACCO IS TODAY.

119
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,540
STEVE: I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

120
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,275
MANY TIMES WE HAVE DONE

121
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,610
SEGMENTS ON POT AND PEOPLE

122
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,079
RIGHT IN AND SAY DRINKING IS

123
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,579
LEGAL.

124
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,348
IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN

125
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:02,915
DRINKING, IS IT?

126
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,519
>> WELL, DEFINITELY IT

127
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,386
DIFFERENT.

128
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,288
AGAIN, REGULATING

129
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,657
RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, YOU

130
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,460
KNOW, JOE MENTIONED, YOU

131
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,796
KNOW, ISSUES AS IT RELATES

132
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:17,730
TO OPIOIDS.

133
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,664
RIGHT?

134
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,334
OUR BIG PUSH IN OUR COMPANY

135
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,803
IS CBD AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING

136
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:24,704
PEOPLE ON OPIOIDS.

137
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:29,141
IF YOU CAN MOVE PEOPLE

138
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,376
AGAINST RECREATIONAL MORE

139
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,478
TOWARDS THE CBD SIDE WHERE

140
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,713
YOU ARE NOT GETTING HIGH

141
00:03:33,714 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WOULD BE A PLUS.
