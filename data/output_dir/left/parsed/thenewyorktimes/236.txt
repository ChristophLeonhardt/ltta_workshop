We often see airstrikes and
missile launches this way:
miles away from their
targets, or overhead
but through a distant
lens,
or maybe just from 
a safe proximity.
We see the “awe” but
rarely feel the “shock.”
Because the Syrian conflict has
been so thoroughly documented
in video,
we now have another
perspective:
what it’s like to
experience that shock.
A single person on
the ground, targeted
by something that
can move faster,
see better and hit harder.
Moving just a short distance
can save your life.
There’s often silence. 
No warning.
Sometimes there’s
little else to do
but wait.
Other times the only
thing to do is run —
even when what you’re running
from can travel faster
than the speed of sound.
This was said to show
an American airstrike
on Syrian regime
forces last year.
The technology directing
these weapons
means you can be close to impact
and yet unharmed.
Islamic State said
this was a U.S. airstrike.
Yes, many times weapons
come from far away.
But sometimes the
warning is clear.
This was a Russian
cruise missile
over Syria several years ago:
a rare glimpse of a high tech
aerial attack in transit.
Of course, these are all
brief moments of impact.
The aftermaths go on.
