WHEEL TOMORROW FOR THE 500 ON FOX. THE GEICO 500 ON FOX. PETE: MAN WAS WEARING A SEAT BELT. IT WAS THE TWEET THAT BROKE THE INTERNET THIS WEEK. KANYE WEST SHARING HIS SUPPORT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, TWEETING IN PART BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH TRUMP BUT THE MOB CAN'T MAKE ME NOT LOVE HIM. WE ARE BOTH DRAGON ENERGY. HE IS MY BROTHER. WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT FREE-THINKING. THE LEFT MELTING DOWN AS THE PRESIDENT EMBRACED KANYE'S TWEETS. BOTH EYES ARE BEING OPEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES. SO WHAT DOES THE REACTION TO KANYE WEST SAY ABOUT THE GROWING DIVIDE IN OUR COUNTRY. MICHELLE RICHIE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST. DR. DARREN PORCHER ARMY VETERAN AND CATHY BARNETT RADIO TALK SHOW HOST. WELCOME TO YOU ALL. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU, GOOD MORNING. PETE: THIS EXCHANGE BETWEEN CANAL YEA AND THE PRESIDENT CHANCE THE RAPPER AND CANDACE OWENS. FROM THE OUTSIDE, CAN LOOK LIKE A GIGANTIC CONVERSATION BEING HAD INSIDE THE BLACK COMMUNITY ABOUT FREE THINKING AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THAT HAPPENING AND IS IT CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY. I HONESTLY THINK THAT KANYE WEST RIGHT NOW IS BEING USED AS A POLITICAL PAWN TO CONTINUE THIS TRUMP MOVEMENT. AND I THINK THAT THIS JUST IS ANOTHER DISINGENUOUS AND QUITE FRANKLY INSULTING POLITICAL STRATEGY THAT WE SEE BOTH ON THE LEFT AND ON THE RIGHT. AND WHICH POLITICIANS PANDER TO BLACK VOTERS BY USING CULTURAL INFLUENCES TO GAIN THEIR SUPPORT WHILE REALLY DOING NOTHING FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY. I DON'T THINK THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE UPSET AT THE FACT THAT CHANCE THE RAPPER OR KANYE ACTUALLY SUPPORT CONSERVATIVES. I THINK IT'S THE TIME OF CONSERVATIVES THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY SUPPORTING. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL NOT DENOUNCE WHITE SUPREMACY OR WHITE NATIONALIST. PETE: HE HAS DENOUNCED WHITE SUPREMACY AND WHITE NATIONALISM. BUT HE HAS ALSO SAID THAT THERE IS GOOD AND BAD PEOPLE WITHIN THE WHITE NATIONALIST NETWORK WHICH I JUST THINK IS WRONG. PETE: THERE ARE GOOD AND BAD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. THERE ARE NOT GOOD WHITE NATIONALISTS. PETE: I DIDN'T SAY THAT I SAID EVERYWHERE. HE WAS DENOUNCED WHITE NATIONALISM HE HAS DONE IT MANY TIMES. DARREN, IT WAS ACTUALLY THOUGH, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT USING MOMENTS, IT WAS KANYE THAT STARTED. THIS HE IS THE ONE THAT RESPONDED TO CANDACE OWENS. HE TWEETED THIS RECENTLY HE SAID I HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH RESEARCH ON CONSERVATIVES TO BE CALLED ONE. I'M JUST REFUSING TO BE ENSLAVED BY MONOLITHIC THOUGHT. IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT FREE-THINKING AND THE ABILITY TO SPEAK YOUR MIND. I THINK FREE THINKING IS THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS. LOOK AT CELEBRITY MARKET. HIGHLY LEFTIST DEMOCRATS AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE THIS PROVOKING WAY OF GETTING AFRICAN-AMERICANS INTO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NO MATTER WHAT THEY ARE DOING. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION KANYE'S VIEW. KANYE UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING. WHEN WE LOOK AT SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, IT'S REALLY BENEFITED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WHEN WE LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IS EXPERIENCING SUCH AS CRIME, WE SEE A TREMENDOUS WE SEE PRECIPITOUS DROPS IN CRIME IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AS A RESULT OF TRUMP BEING IN OFFICE. YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DONALD TRUMP, EXCUSE ME, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN OFFICE, HE INCARCERATED MORE AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT WITH EXCLUSION OF BILL CLINTON. WE GO BACK TO THE 1994 CRIME BILL BY THAT WAS ENABLED BY BILL CLINTON WE HAD MONSTROUS NUMBERS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS INCARCERATED AS A RESULT OF THAT. TRUMP IS MOVING FORWARD. WE ARE LOOKING IN EXCESS OF 3% G.D.P. AND THEREFORE I SEE THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS BENEFITING. WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT KANYE STATED, I THINK HE IS JUST LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE AS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO BENEFIT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. PETE: KANYE TWEETED ABOUT CHICAGO SAYING THIS OBAMA WAS IN OFFICE FOR 8 YEARS AND NOTHING IN CHICAGO CHANGED. IS THIS A REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING I HAVE BEEN PANDERED TO FOR A LONG TIME OR MY CELEBRITIES HAVE BEEN PUT UP ON A PEDESTAL BUT MY LIFE HASN'T CHANGED. YES. STORY IS A PERFECT DEMONSTRATION OF THE HYPOCRISY AND THE EXTREME INTOLERANCE OF THE LIBERAL LEFT. THEY SAY WE WANT BLACK PEOPLE'S VOICE TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT AND THEN THE MOMENT A BLACK MAN STANDS UP AND SAYS SOMETHING CONTRARY TO THE AGENDA OF THE LEFT, HE IS IMMEDIATELY MET WITH SWIFT AND CRUEL PUNISHMENT. FOR ME TO SAY I AM BLACK, BUT I AM NOT A DEMOCRAT IS SEEN AS BETRAYAL IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. I LOST ALMOST ALL OF MY BLACK FRIENDS DURING THE 2016 ELECTION BECAUSE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM FOR INDEPENDENT THINKING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES, ESPECIALLY TO POLITICS. I REMEMBER MICHELLE OBAMA BEING ON TV 1 WHICH IS A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK TELEVISION STATION AND SHE SAID IT DOES NOT MATTER WHO IS ON THAT BALLOT. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT THEY SAID. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. YOU JUST VOTE DEMOCRAT MEANING SHUT UP BLACK PEOPLE, GET IN LINE AND DO AS YOU ARE TOLD. IT REMINDED ME THAT NOT ALL OVERSEERS ON PLANTATIONS WERE WHITE. THERE WERE BLACK AS WELL AND THEY WERE CALLED DRIVERS. PETE: UNFORTUNATELY I'M BEING TOLD IN MY EAR WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT RIGHT THERE. WE WILL BRING YOU BACK VERY SOON. THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO
