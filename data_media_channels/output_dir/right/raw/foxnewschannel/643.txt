1
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:06,139
BENJAMIN HALL IN LONDON AS THEY

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,941
TALK ABOUT DETAILS THAT ALLOWED

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,475
THEM TO SURVIVE IN THE CAVE SO

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:09,776
LONG.

5
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:10,977
REPORTER: THIS IS THE MOMENT

6
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:14,380
WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR, HOW

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,915
DID THEY SURVIVE?

8
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,452
HOW WAS IT LIKE IN THE CAVE FOR

9
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,854
18 DAYS AT FIRST 11.

10
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,755
HOW DID THEY GET IT THROUGH

11
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:23,323
MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY?

12
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:26,125
THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING, SPEAKING

13
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,227
IN DEPTH.

14
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:28,528
THEY WENT OFF SAYING WHY THEY

15
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,395
WENT INTO THE CAVE.

16
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,664
THEY WENT IN FOR EXCURSION.

17
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,702
KNEW THEY WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO

18
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,405
CAVE IN THE PAST, ENCOUNTERED

19
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,307
SAME PROBLEMS, RISING WATER,

20
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,342
ALMOST GOT STUCK.

21
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,576
NEVERTHELESS THEY DECIDED TO GO

22
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,677
BACK IN.

23
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,312
THEY DECIDED TO GO FOR ONE HOUR.

24
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,914
AS THEY WALKED IN, THEY

25
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,182
EVENTUALLY REACHED A POINT

26
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,316
COULDN'T WALK ANY FURTHER.

27
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,217
SO THEY DIEDED TO SWIM.

28
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,719
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING PERHAPS

29
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,187
THEY TO THE THEMSELVES INTO THIS

30
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:54,520
PROBLEM.

31
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,322
BUT THEY GOT IN ONE POINT.

32
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,790
THE CAVE WHERE THEY WERE FINALLY

33
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,324
FOUND.

34
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,426
THEY REALIZED WATER RISEN BEHIND

35
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:00,727
THEM.

36
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,928
THEY COULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER.

37
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:02,428
THEY WERE STUCK.

38
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,696
HERE IS WHAT SOME OF THEM

39
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,132
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT MOMENT.

40
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,835
>> Translator: I WAS THINKING

41
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:13,473
THAT OH, WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET

42
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:13,773
OUT.

43
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,575
TRY TO CALM DOWN.

44
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,177
I DID NOT FEEL FRIGHTENED.

45
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,581
I TOLD EVERYONE BE COURAGE.

46
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,317
DO NOT LOSE HOPE.

47
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,985
REPORTER: IT WAS VERY NEXT DAY

48
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,687
THEY REALIZED THAT THEY WERE

49
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:29,856
THEM.

50
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,658
SO THEY BEGAN TO TRY TO DIG

51
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,259
THEIR WAY OUT BACK OF THE CAVE.

52
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,928
BY THE TIME THEY WERE FOUND 11

53
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,865
DAYS LATER, THEY MANAGED TO DIG

54
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,967
THROUGH 15 FEET OF MUD AND ROCK,

55
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,201
TAKING THROUGH SHIFTS.

56
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,269
THEY HAD NO FOOD WITH THEM.

57
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,504
THEY HAD A LITTLE BIT OF WATER

58
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,605
AND TORCH.

59
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,373
THEY TRIED THE BEST TO CONSERVE

60
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,374
THAT THROUGHOUT THE STAY.

61
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,843
BY THE END OF 11 DAYS THEY WERE

62
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:55,882
THEY MEDITATED TOGETHER.

63
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,717
THEY CONTROLLED BREATHING TO

64
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:58,818
CONSERVE OXYGEN BECAUSE THEIR

65
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:02,455
TEACHER WAS A MONK.

66
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,958
THEY MANAGED TO GET THROUGH IT,

67
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,560
SADLY ONE OF THE THINGS THE LOST

68
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,361
LIFE NAVY SEAL.

69
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,363
THEY FELT FOR THE FAMILY AND

70
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,632
FEEL PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

71
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,202
THEY WILL TO ON LIVE LIFE TO THE

72
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:16,869
FULLEST AS A RESULT.

73
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,971
BRIAN: THEY WEREN'T TRYING TO

74
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,205
GET OUT OF THE RAIN.

75
00:02:19,206 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WERE GOING ON EXCURSION.
