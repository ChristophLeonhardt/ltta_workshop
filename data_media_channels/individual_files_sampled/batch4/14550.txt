from derangement syndrome continues unabated now the usual suspects are comparing the president to a serial killer how long can they go activists art collective in decline was in the news two years ago when they installed life-size statues of Donald Trump in the nude in five cities across the u.s. so what are these bozos do for an encore well they bring back the new Trump effigy but with a twist they position the statue with a clown face next to a quote from one of America's most notorious serial killers John Wayne Gacy oh they are able to accomplish this by taking part in some vandalism in the wee hours of the morning because this is apparently what makes for political discourse in 2018 they even made a little movie about their criminality check it out okay so they vandalize a billboard that they don't know but what does Donald J Trump and John Wayne Gacy have in common well absolutely nothing of course but let's not let the facts interfere with a good yarn here because here's what an in decline spokes thing he told Vice quote Trump said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters and if things progress the way they are now especially in terms of what Trump's environmental policies are doing to the planet you'll have a bigger body count than Gacy ever would you could look at Trump as a maniacal serial killer in terms of what he's done to the fundamentals of democracy things that we not just cherish but we also assume are untouchable he's really trippin away at them things like the freedom of the press Human Rights civil decency cultural diversity end quote of course there are no hard facts presented to prove these allegations but that's how the Left rolls these days apparently and what pray tell is the deal with the Trump statue being naked in the first place did Trump experience a wardrobe malfunction at some point no there is no point except to display mean-spirited mockery what's more this only indicates yet again how immature and hypocritical the Left have become the progressives have long told us correctly I might add that we should never judge someone on their physical appearance or based on their race skin color religion nationality etc yet here's an attack on how the president presumably looks when naked does it get any more infantile than that alas I would argue that when it comes to nakedness much like a certain fiction Emperor it is the progressives these days who have no clothes for the rebel media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the Bible with you wherever you go
