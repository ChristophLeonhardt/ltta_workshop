HIMSELF AT THE OUTSET OF THIS HEARING TODAY HE LOOKED UNHINGED. HE LOOK PASSIONATE AND UNSCRIPTED. HERE TO REACT TO YESTERDAY'S MEETINGS SOCIAL MEDIA SUPER STARS AND DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS DIAMOND AND SILK. SO, LADIES, WELCOME BACK. YOU SAW A PANEL OF PEOPLE LIKE MINDED PEOPLE SAYING HOW UNHINGED BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS. MAN, WAS HE DIFFERENT THAN HE WAS WITH MARTHA MACCALLUM. DID HE HELP HIMSELF? HE HELPED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SPOKE FROM THE HEART. THAT'S RIGHT. HE DREW US ALL IN AND HAD US ALL CRYING. WE FELT EVERYTHING THAT HE FELT AND I BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD BE CONFIRMED. I BELIEVE HIM. AND WE STAND WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH. THAT'S WHO WE STAND WITH. STEVE: LADIES, WHAT ABOUT DR. CHRISTINE FORD? BECAUSE SHE WAS FIRST UP AND SHE TESTIFIED YESTERDAY SHE READ HER STATEMENT. IT WAS HEART-FELT. AND THEN SHE WAS ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY REAL NEW DETAILS AND, IN FACT, THE FOUR PEOPLE SHE QUOTED HAVE IN SWORN TESTIMONY DENIED THAT IT HAPPENED. HER BEST FRIEND DENIED THAT SHE HAD EVEN MET BRETT KAVANAUGH AND MS. FORD HAD SAID THAT SHE WAS THERE THAT NIGHT. WHAT ABOUT HER TESTIMONY THOUGH? HER TESTIMONY MAY HAVE BEEN HEART-FELT, THERE WERE TOO MANY HOLES IN HER STORY AND HER STORY WAS FALLING APART. I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T CRY WITH HER. I CRIED WITH HIM. I FELT HIS PAIN. I DIDN'T FEEL ANY EMOTION FROM HER BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T KEEP HERSELF TOGETHER. THAT'S RIGHT. PAPERS WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. SHE HAD HER LAWYERS DICTATING WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY, WHAT SHE SHOULDN'T SAY. I LOOK AT ALL OF THAT I PAID ATTENTION TO ALL OF THAT. YEAH. SHE DIDN'T DRAW ME IN. HE DREW US ALL IN AND WE BELIEVE HIM. STEVE: LADIES, IT SEEMS LIKE SHE BELIEVES THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED HER BACK IN 1982. OKAY. BUT, LISTEN, I BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS ABUSED AND LOOKING AT HER FROM YESTERDAY, LOOKING AT HER DEMEANOR AND DISPOSITION, I BELIEVE SHE WAS ABUSED PROBABLY EARLIER THAN 15 YEARS OLD. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH DID. THIS. RIGHT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AND SHAME ON THE DEMOCRATS FOR EXPLOITING HER AND EXPLOITING HER STORY. AND IF THEY REALLY CARED ABOUT DR. FORD, WHY DIDN'T THEY GO TO THE POLICE? WHY DIDN'T THEY GO TO THE FBI? EXACTLY. THE ONE THING THAT I NEED TO SAY TO ALL AMERICANS, YESTERDAY IT WAS KAVANAUGH. TODAY IT COULD BE YOUR BROTHER, YOUR SON, YOUR FATHER OR YOUR HUSBAND. SO VOTE RIGHT SO YOU WON'T GET LEFT. VOTE REPUBLICAN BECAUSE THE CIRCUS AND THE CHARADES THAT THE DEMOCRATS JUST PULLED, I DON'T EVER WANT TO VOTE FOR ANOTHER DEMOCRAT. THAT'S RIGHT. AINSLEY: IT'S AN INTERESTING TIME BECAUSE IT'S THE ME TOO MOVEMENT AND IF YOU ARE A MAN AND ACCUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME YOU ARE GUILTY UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE WHICH IS AGAINST WHAT THE LAW SAYS. AS A WOMAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS REALLY HAPPENING THEN? I WATCHED HER TESTIMONY AND THOUGHT GOSH, THIS IS REALLY BELIEVABLE. WE ALL KNOW A LOT OF WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN SITUATIONS AND DAMAGED THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. SO, VERY BELIEVABLE BUT THEN YOU HEARD FROM HIM AND YOU SAW HOW UPSET HE WAS. AND IT WAS VERY BELIEVABLE, TOO. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE TRUTH IS? WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS HAPPENING? WELL, THE TRUTH FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE. KAVANAUGH HAD THINGS TO SUBSTANTIATE. HE KEPT CALENDARS. I WAS JUST SO TAKEN ABACK BY THAT SHE COULDN'T KEEP HER STORY TOGETHER. THAT'S RIGHT. SHE HAS NO PROOF. ACCUSATIONS, ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT ACCURATE INFORMATION IS MERELY SPECULATION. THAT'S RIGHT. AINSLEY: DO YOU THINK SHE IS LYING? ARE YOU SAYING SHE LIED? I'M NOT SAYING THAT SHE LIED. I'M NOT SAYING THAT SHE LIED. I BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS ABUSED SOMEWHERE BUT IT WAS NOT BY BRETT KAVANAUGH. THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS NOT BY HIM. YESTERDAY, HIS FATHER, BRETT KAVANAUGH'S FATHER SAVED HIS LIFE AND IT WAS SO GOOD TO FINALLY SEE REPUBLICANS SAYING AND BAN AND NOT FALL AND GO COLD. IT WAS FINALLY GOOD TO SEE REPUBLICANS CALL OUT THE
