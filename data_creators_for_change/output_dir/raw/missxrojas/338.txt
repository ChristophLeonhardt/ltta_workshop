00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,719
acting styles as well as individual

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,180
ranges that just just mind-blowing David

Tennant as well as neither<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those</font>

20
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,510
actors who could so easily big typecast

and closed<font color="#E5E5E5"> into very specific roles but</font>

to get your groove back on while on a

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,680
weekend break from stress well exercise

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,690
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pilates and running and things like</font>

30
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,949
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really good way to</font>

31
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,420
fill yourself with energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

32
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,859
discussing this with my sister earlier

33
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,329
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really great to have a</font>

34
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,420
balance so to have one day of<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest and</font>

35
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,100
then one<font color="#CCCCCC"> day of productivity especially</font>

36
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,990
in a weekend now one day of total rest

37
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,490
doesn't necessarily mean sleeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bed</font>

38
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,810
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> day you might find that actually</font>

39
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,460
drags down your energy eff was rather

40
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,680
than raising that<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the museum's go</font>

41
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,140
to free museums go to your events go for

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,820
walks in the bike<font color="#CCCCCC"> get four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walks in the</font>

43
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,830
park or meet up with friends but do

44
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,330
things that fill you with energy run

45
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,950
things they take<font color="#E5E5E5"> away your energy it</font>

46
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,180
might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for everyone but time</font>

47
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,430
management basically is the best way for

48
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,960
me and the last of the Twitter questions

49
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Emily or and dash asks what's your take</font>

50
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,579
on saving I think savings great and you

51
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,570
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> really important and really</font>

52
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,790
impressive however I do think that in

53
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,950
the current climate for students it's

54
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,590
extremely difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> save because</font>

55
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,600
they're asking my expenses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

56
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make these decisions like I had to</font>

57
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,720
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decision do I want to stay and</font>

58
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,030
live at home with my mother and save a

59
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,390
lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work and and pay off my</font>

60
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,420
overdraft and XY said order I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

61
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,159
take the opportunity to live my friends

62
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,079
and live really independently or rather

63
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,750
continue to live independently<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be in</font>

64
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,070
a situation where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm forced to get a</font>

65
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,719
job other words I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my rent and</font>

66
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,310
put off getting myself into a situation

67
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,440
in which I would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say well I</font>

68
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,260
appreciate this

69
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,939
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really important and it's something</font>

70
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do I</font>

71
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,540
would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have savings not as cut</font>

72
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,950
and dry as up to me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

73
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,140
lot of situations that can affect your

74
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,599
decisions regarding my curious sock pig

75
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,489
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube asks do you have any tips</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

76
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,079
students who have bad teachers and

77
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,659
important subjects<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that all</font>

78
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,750
subjects are important is one thing I

79
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,420
would say you draw<font color="#CCCCCC"> from them later on in</font>

80
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,329
life in weird ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

81
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,519
expect to draw from them I've taken a

82
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,590
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> from like secondary school history</font>

83
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,060
classes and secondary school geography

84
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,709
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some terrible teachers for the</font>

85
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,180
subject so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found most difficult like</font>

86
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,859
maths on some level they were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

87
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,480
teachers but then further than that they

88
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,180
didn't like teaching me because I wasn't

89
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">very good at maths and I think that made</font>

90
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,319
them you know slightly resentful of

91
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,180
having to teach the stupid group as it

92
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,069
were sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know not in every in</font>

93
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,540
not in every case I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

94
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,430
to get through that is to just find and

95
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,099
read other books that<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain things</font>

96
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,230
more clearly the thing about books and

97
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube videos explaining these sorts of</font>

98
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,690
things they there as patient as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

99
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,310
them to be because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go back to</font>

100
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can repeat them and you can</font>

101
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,419
work through problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them whereas</font>

102
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,910
with some teachers you just can't you

103
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,220
try really hard and you you put any

104
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,829
effort to have extra sessions with them

105
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,739
but they won't respond and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

106
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,599
sometimes just get past that and if you

107
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,790
can't afford one on one tutoring then

108
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,040
use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources use the internet and</font>

109
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,590
and find books get books at the library

110
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,290
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will really help</font>

111
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">you the flip side to that I would also</font>

112
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,949
say you have a right to complain<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

113
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,389
teacher because obviously it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

114
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,220
your year and yourself that's been

115
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,049
affected it's going to be a next

116
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,579
generation of people as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as all the</font>

117
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,750
other people in the schools<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

118
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">taught by that person so I was felt very</font>

119
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,099
strongly that if I was unhappy with the

120
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,780
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of education I was being given I</font>

121
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,370
would just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the head of department</font>

122
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,709
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone else that I trusted and</font>

123
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,750
and tell them that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

124
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,069
teacher was doing particularly well I

125
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,409
had one teacher who responded<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

126
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,569
extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> badly and extremely unfairly</font>

127
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,280
in the middle of the classic used a sort

128
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,620
of backstabbing her and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

129
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,269
this stuff but at the end of the day

130
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,680
