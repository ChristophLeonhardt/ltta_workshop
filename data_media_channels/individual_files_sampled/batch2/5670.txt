I'm done right now by the author Parkland High School graduate David Hawk David thank you for joining us tell us about your goals for the months ahead so our main goals for the month ahead first off is just getting morally just leaders elected not just Democrats or Republicans but people that actually emphasize with students and understand that the people that are being lost every day from the southside of Chicago to parkland Florida to Liberty City are people they're people just like you and me they're people that we just like the people that we care about and they're people that are lost and it's important for people that emphasize with those children and those adults because that's one of the reasons behind why my sister and I wrote this book it's to show people what is going on in this country and how we can't allow these things to continue to happen and how even if these things haven't affected you yet don't let them get out and vote vote for morally just leaders that are willing to vote for things like universal background checks unlike our Speaker of the House who won't even bring it to the floor and work together so that we can solve this problem as Americans because we've owned your book and your book David your books called date never again you talk about universal background checks what you just said you're also talking about banning high-capacity magazines of ammunition and of course assault weapons banning those how about the senators from your state how about Rick Scott who's running for he's the governor and what about the Marco Rubio where are they on these issues that you talked about in the book Marco Rubio pretty much refuses to talk to me in fact that's part of the reason why I'm wearing this price tag right now which says a dollar in five cents the reasoning behind that is that's the amount of money Marco Rubio has taken from the NRA divided by every student in our state many Republican lawmakers not all of them in fact many of them have been willing to sit down and talk with us such as Senator Jeff Flake and Murkowski they've been very they've actually been willing to listen unlike my Senator Marco Rubio in Florida but bill Nelson has been able to sit down with us multiple times and asked how he can help and that's the best thing people can do just simply ask how you can help what are you going to tell your voters and they are voters you're 18 voters in Florida for example in the we in the weeks and months ahead beachboard November I'm going to tell them like it doesn't matter if they're a Democrat or Republican just do your research into who they're special interests are and ask yourself do you want those special interests to be governing you because at the end of the day right now it's not our politicians that are governing us it's the corporate special interests that get them elected that are and that's what a lot of these things to continue and right what happened at our school on February 14th happened if we had politicians that actually were willing to take action after Columbine and the NRA didn't block things like universal background checks then these things wouldn't continue to happen and understand we this is not anything against NRA members we know that the NRA does teach some safety lessons and that they do advocate for safety but there's also a different part of the organization that advocates actively against things like universal background checks not because they don't support them but because when they have in the past they've lost members to things like the Gun Owners of America let me ask you about the ton of your book never again of course those of us who remember history yourself included I believe know that never again is a really an historic cry that we never have a Holocaust again what happened in Europe in the 1940s where six million Jews were killed and others were killed is that too strong a title do you think well obviously not in your case you think it is why is your call just as vivid we since the beginning of this when we made the hashtag we worked through that and we talked about and I bring this up a lot in the I talk about this in the book specifically how we don't use that term lightly and we understand that of course we just we don't want these things to happen ever again either and that's the hashtag that we used in the beginning of it and that's been the trait a part of the trademark of this movement you know strong language strong message good luck to you sir David hog voter author graduate of Parkland High School and advocate for gun control and gun safety the book is never again a new generation draws the line hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
