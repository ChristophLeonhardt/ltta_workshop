I AM MARK CRUMPTON, THIS IS
BLOOMBERG.
BLOOMBERG WEST DOES NEXT.
-- IS NEXT.
♪
>> THIS IS BLOOMBERG WEST.
COMING UP TO MY TECH TAKES
CHARGE.
WHY THE SECTOR IS EXERTING MORE
CONTROL IN U.S. MARKETS THAN AT
ANY OTHER TIME SINCE THE.COM
BUBBLE.
THIS IS GOING E-COMMERCE START
UP BEHIND THE GREAT WALL.
THEY CUT A DEAL WITH ALIBABA TO
GIVE AMAZON A RUN FOR THEIR
MONEY.
AND CHINA'S BIG PLANS FOR THE
ADVERTISING AID.
MEDIA. THAT IS THE LATEST TO BE
SNAPPED UP BY CHINESE INVESTORS.
THE CEO JOINS US LATER THIS
HOUR.
FIRST, TO THE LEAD.
TECH STOCKS EXERTING MORE
CONTROL OVER U.S. MARKETS THAN
IN ANY OTHER TIME SINCE THE
INTERNET BUBBLE.
THE LARGEST TECH STOCKS, WE'RE
TALKING MICROSOFT, ALPHABET,
THIS SPLIT, AMAZON, SEEING
MASSIVE MULTIYEAR RALLIES.
THAT IS CLOSEST TO ITS WIDEST
EVER.
WE HAVE MORE.
BREAK IT DOWN WITH ME.
EXIT IS GETTING TO BE ABOUT 21%.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE
IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THE
PERCENTAGE CHANGES, IT IS
RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE
MARKET.
IT IS PICKING UP A BIGGER SLICE
SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT 21%.
YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE WHITE
LINE WITH THE INFOTECH.
OBVIOUSLY THE BIGGEST ONE RIGHT
NOW.
COMPARE THAT TO SOMETHING LIKE
FINANCIALS, IT HAS BEEN FLAT FOR
THAT GROUP THROUGHOUT THIS
RECOVERY.
THE TECH STOCKS HAVE LED THE
WAY.
IT HAS BEEN A BIT OF A
TURNAROUND IN THE EARNINGS
REPORTS, WHERE TECH HAS BEEN
LEADING SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT
20%, 14 OR 15 FOR THE
FINANCIALS.
THOSE ARE TYPICALLY THE BIGGEST
GROUPS.
YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS COMPARES.
THIS LEVEL WE ARE AT FOUR TECH
IS A BIT HIGHER THAN IT HAS
BEEN.
NOTHING QUITE COMPARED TO WHERE
WE WERE IN 2000.
I WANT TO BRING UP ANOTHER CHART
HERE THAT IS INTERESTING.
LOOKING AT THE SALE STORY.
THERE IS -- THIS IS A FUNCTION
OF MARKET CAP.
MARKET CAP IS SHARES IN PRICE.
AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH THEM OF ITS BIG LEADERS.
AMAZON, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE,
MICROSOFT.
SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE
BEEN LEADING THE CHARGE IN TERMS
OF THAT MARKET CAP EXPANSION.
THIS SHOWS THE DIVERSIONS THAT
HAS SHOWN.
VALUATIONS ARE HIGH BUT PART OF
THE SOBRIETY OF THIS RALLY HAS
BEEN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE
STILL PRETTY LOW VALUATIONS AND
SOME OF THESE BIG COMPANIES.
THE YOU LOOK AT MICROSOFT,
GOOGLE, THEY ARE GETTING BACK TO
RATIOS DOWN TO IT AS CLOSER TO
ZERO.
YOU HAVE AN S&P AVERAGE OF ABOUT
THREE.
THERE IS NOT QUITE THE SAME
EXUBERANCE.
MAYBE THAT IS WHY INVESTORS ARE
THAT HE THIS RALLY AND NOT TOO
CONCERNED.
REMY: A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT CAUGHT
IN THE.COM BUBBLE.
>> THIS IS BASICALLY THE STORY
IN ONE SIMPLE CHART.
YOU CAN SEE WHAT WAS GOING BACK
IN 2000, 1999.
THE TOP PANEL HERE IS THE TECH
SECTOR IN THE WHITE.
THE PRICE TO EARNINGS IN THE
PAST 12 MONTHS VERSUS THE S&P
AND BLUE.
THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING.
THE SPREAD IS AT THE BOTTOM.
LOOK AT HOW HIGH TECH STOCKS --
WERE VALUED.
NOT EVEN COME TO WHAT WE HAD
TODAY.
YOU HAVE 20 TO 21 PE IN THE TECH
AS WELL AS THE S&P.
THINGS ARE BLOWN OUT OF
PROPORTION.
IT ACCURATE TO THOUSAND, YOU
HAVE TECH STOCKS TRADING 80
TIMES 12 MONTH EARNINGS AND IT
WAS BUILDING, HARD TO KNOW WHEN
YOU HIT THAT TOP THAT WE WILL --
YOU'VE SEE THAT FLAT LINE,
BASICALLY THE SAME AND I HAVE
ONE MUST CHART THAT IS SHOWING
THE SAME PRINCIPLE.
THIS IS LOOKING AT THOSE
EARNINGS SO BOILING IT DOWN A
LITTLE MORE ACUTELY WHEN YOU
LOOK AT PROFITS.
THIS SPEAKS TO THE IDEA THAT
RINGS ARE PRETTY HIGHLY VALUED
IN SOME AREAS OF TECH MARKET BUT
NOTHING INCREDIBLE ESPECIALLY
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR
NOT EARNINGS CAN PROVIDE A
BACKSTOP.
THE BLUE LINE ASSURING YOU THAT
TECH EARNINGS GROWTH EPS THIS IS
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE
LAST YEAR.
WE HAVE NOT GONE ANYWHERE BUT
TECH IS STILL UP, UP 25% SINCE
THE START OF THE BULL MARKET.
THAT EARNINGS BACKDROP GIVES
PEOPLE ENCOURAGEMENT AND WHETHER
THINGS ARE BLOWN OUT OF
PROPORTION.
RENY: THE NASDAQ AND THE S&P
TECH SECTOR HAVE BEEN UP 23%.
SOME AMAZING NUMBERS THERE.
TURNING OUT TO ASIA.
ALIBABA HAS BEEN ADDING SOCIAL
FEATURES TO ITS MOBILE APP TO
ATTRACT YOUNGER CUSTOMERS AND
GET THEM TO STAND THE APP LONGER
AND ENTICE THEM TO SPEND MORE
MONEY.
THAT STRATEGY MAY BE PAYING OFF.
ACTIVE NUMBERS JUMPED AND MOBILE
REVENUE IS UP TO TWO AND $6
BILLION IN THE JUNE QUARTER.
PEOPLE ARE VISITING THE APP MORE
THAN SEVEN TIMES A DAY SPENDING
OVER 25 MINUTES IN TOTAL.
COMPARE THAT TO NINE MINUTES ON
AMAZON'S MOBILE APP OR 16
MINUTES ON TWITTER.
SOME INTERESTING STUFF HERE.
HOW WERE THEY ABLE TO DO THIS?
CELINE: THEY STARTED WITH A
SIMPLE APP BUT IT HAS EVOLVED
INTO SOMETHING MUCH DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT WE THINK OF AS TYPICAL
AS E-COMMERCE.
AMAZON'S STATS ARE MUCH LOWER.
THEY HAVE THIS VERY YOUNG BASE
OF USERS AND TO HOOK THEM AND
THEY NEED TO ADD ALL THE SOCIAL
FEATURES.
A CONJOINT ONE OF OVER 1000
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, YOU CAN
WATCH LIVE FEED FROM YOUR
FAVORITE BLOG OR TESTING OUT
YOUR FAVORITE MAKEUP OR READ
YOUR FAVORITE NEWS FEED.
THAT IS WHAT KEEPS THEM COMING
BACK FOR MORE.
RENY: IT SEEMS LIKE THE NUMBERS
ARE NOT PLAYING OUT ON THAT JUST
YET.
DEFINITELY AN ENVY.
WHAT IS THE DISCONNECT IN TERMS
OF THE COMPANIES?
CELINE: FACEBOOK HAS TRIED TO
GET PEOPLE TO SHOP AND INSIGHT,
THEY HAVE ADDED THE BUY BUTTON.
SAME THING WITH TWITTER AND
INTEREST AND AMAZON HAS NOT MADE
ANY MAJOR INROADS INTO SOCIAL
NETWORK.
THERE IS A HOST OF REASONS WHY
THERE ARE THESE DIFFERENCES BUT
THE MAIN ONE IS CHINA HAS HIS
ENORMOUS BASE THAT IS GROWING
AND THEY ARE USED TO THE
EXTREMELY CRAMPED INTERFACES.
TO A TYPICAL WESTERN SMARTPHONE
USER IT WOULD BE OVERWHELMING.
SO BECAUSE OF THAT THE CHINESE
ECOSYSTEM THESE COMPANIES HAVE
AN ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING
ALTOGETHER, YOU CAN LOOK AT
REACH OUT, SOCIAL MESSAGE, BOOK
A TAXI, GET A HAIRCUT.
THAT IS WHY IT HAS BEEN HARD TO
CHANGE THE HABITS OF THE U.S.
CONSUMER?
>> IF THEY WANT TO PUT
EVERYTHING UP AGAINST THE WALL
TO SEE WHAT STICKS IT IS HELPING
THERE.
I DO WANT TO BRING UP A QUOTE
THAT YOU HAD FROM THE COFOUNDER
OF ALIBABA TALKING ABOUT HIS
COMPARISON WITH FACEBOOK.
HE SAID ON FACEBOOK YOU ARE
FRIENDING YOUR FRIENDS BUT THEY
START WITH STRANGERS AND USE
DATA TO FIND A COMMONALITY OF
INTEREST AND CREATE A COMMUNITY.
DO YOU THINK IN THE WEST THAT
THAT COULD MAKE TRACTION?
CELINE: HE IS SAYING THE
E-COMMERCE SITE HAS ALL THESE
DATA POINTS.
THEY ARE ABLE TO GROUP PEOPLE
INTO WHAT YOU BUY, WHAT YOU
LIKE, CREEPY.
THAT IS WHY THERE ARE THESE
FORCING SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS
FROM FISHING OR WEDDING PLANNING
OR BABY PLANNING.
IN THE U.S. AMAZON, THEY HAVE
NOT REALLY TRY TO DO THIS.
THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO
CHANGE HABITS.
I AM USED TO GOING TO FACEBOOK
TO TALKING TO MY FRIENDS AND
GOING TO AMAZON TO WHY THINGS
AND GOING TO TWITTER TO LOOK AT
NEWS AND TWEETS.
IT IS HARD TO CHANGE HABITS AND
IT WILL TAKE MORE YEARS TO BE
COMFORTABLE SOCIAL NETWORKING
AND ON OTHER TYPES OF APPS.
>> WE DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE
INVESTED IN SNAPCHAT.
HE DOES NOT WANT FOLKS TO KNOW
THAT.
THERE IS ANOTHER ROAD HERE.
HE SAYS WE DO WANT TO LEARN AND
UNDERSTAND HOW SNAPCHAT IS
ENGAGING WITH YOUNG USERS.
WE ARE INTRIGUED BY THE PRODUCT
AND IMPRESSED WITH EVAN STEELE,
THE FOUNDER AND WE WANT TO BE
PARTNERS WAS -- WITH HIM.
WHY DOES HE NOT WANT PEOPLE TO
KNOW?
>> THEY DO NOT WANT TO COMMENT.
THEY KNOW THE U.S. MEDIA, WE ARE
ALL OVER THIS.
ALIBABA AND SEPTET, TELL US
EVERYTHING.
THEY DO NOT WANT PEOPLE
SPECULATING.
ALIBABA IS A SUPER LONG-TERM
ORIENTED STRATEGY.
MOST OF WHAT HE SAID WAS OFF THE
RECORD BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS
THEY REALLY ARE LOOKING TO SEE
WHAT SEPTET IS DOING, HOW THEY
ARE ABLE TO HOOK IN ALL OF THESE
YOUNG USERS IN THE U.S. AND
MAYBE FIVE, 1015, EVEN 20 YEARS
DOWN THE LINE ALL OF THIS
KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE GAINING FROM
THE U.S. INVESTMENTS ARE GOING
TO PAY OFF WHEN IT COMES FULL
FORCE IN THE U.S..

FORMALITIES OF AN INITIAL PUBLIC
OFFERING.
JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT THE
DEAL IS FOUNDER, DIV TURAKHIA.
FIRST QUESTION -- OF ALL THE
COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, WHY DID
YOU DECIDE TO SELL IT TO A
CHINESE ONE?
>> FIRSTLY, THANK YOU FOR HAVING
ME.
WHAT AN EXCITING JOURNEY IT HAS
BEEN FOR US.
THIS PROCESS GOT STARTED AROUND
THE END OF 2015.
WE GOT INTEREST FROM A U.S.
LISTED COMPANY.
WE HAD BEEN BUILDING THIS
COMPANY SEVERAL YEARS.
WE STARTED IN 2010.
WE DECIDED TO HIRE BANKERS.
IN THE PROCESS, WE GOT
INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF INTEREST,
SEVEN BIDDERS IN THE FINAL ROUND
OF THE PROCESS.
WE DECIDED THIS ONE MADE THE
MOST SENSE FOR US.
THEY HAD THE RIGHT COMBINATION
THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.
RAMY: WHAT WAS THAT RIGHT
COMBINATION?
WHAT WERE YOU SPECIFICALLY
LOOKING FOR?
>> WE WERE NOT LOOKING IN THE
FIRST PLACE, RIGHT?
WE WANTED TO CONTINUE BUILDING
THIS BUSINESS.
WITH THIS PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITY
, WE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP
GROWING THE BUSINESS, THE
ABILITY TO GET UPSIDE IN VARIOUS
DIFFERENT STRUCTURES THAT WE CAN
WORK OUT WITH THE CONSORTIUM.
WE GET ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL
MARKET THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE
GOTTEN ACCESS TO.
IT IS THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST
ADVERTISING MARKET.
THIS YEAR, IT WILL BE A $40
BILLION PLUS MARKET.
NEXT YEAR, IT IS EXPECTED TO
GROW TO $50 BILLION PLUS.
MEDIA.NET'S REVENUE COMES ALMOST
ENTIRELY FROM THE U.S.
A SMALL PERCENTAGE COMES FROM
CANADA, THE U.K., AND THE REST
OF THE WORLD.
WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT
FOR THE COMPANY.
TO HAVE THE RIGHT LOCAL PARTNER
IN A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA, THERE
IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY YOU COULD
ABSOLUTELY SCALE WITHOUT LOCAL
RELATIONSHIPS.
LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS WILL ALLOW
US TO LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY
AND GROW IN A LARGE MARKET.
AT THE SAME TIME, LESS
COMPETITIVE THAN THE U.S..
RAMY: THE DEAL WAS STRUCTURED A
BIT UNUSUALLY, SOMEWHAT SAY.
OTHERS WOULD SAY A LITTLE MORE
BLUNTLY.
IT LOOKS LIKE A REVERSE MERGER.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE
OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO FOLKS WHO SAY
IT IS A REVERSE MERGER?
>> IN A REVERSE MERGER, WE WOULD
GET STOCK OFF THE PUBLIC
ENTITIES.
THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING.
THERE IS A REASON THIS
TRANSACTION IS STRUCTURED THIS
WAY.
WE WANT TO TRANSFER TO A GLOBAL
AND SCALABLE BUSINESS.
THEY HAVE THE PLAN AND THE
FUNDING LIVE -- LINED UP.
BUT IT IS A TIME-CONSUMING
PROCESS.
IF YOU ARE IN A COMPETITIVE
BIDDING PROCESS AND HAVE TO GO
THROUGH A TIME-CONSUMING
REGULATORY PROCESS, THERE IS A
GOOD CHANCE YOU WILL NOT MAKE
IT.
THIS WAS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS.
THE ONLY WAY WE COULD HAVE DONE
THIS WAS THIS PARTICULAR
STRUCTURE WHERE THEY START A
CONSORTIUM, GET FUNDING INTO
THAT CONSORTIUM BY MEDIA.NET
ENTIRELY, AND ONCE WE GET THE
REGULATORY TOOLS IN CHINA, IT
WILL BECOME PART OF MCDONOUGH.
BASICALLY, IN A REVERSE
MORTGAGE, YOU HAVE THE PRIVATE
COMPANY GETTING SHARES OF A
PUBLIC COMPANY.
RAMY: LAST YEAR, CHINA MADE A
CALL FOR MORE INVESTMENT INTO
THE AD TECH SPACE.
SOME SEE IT AS POTENTIALLY
SAYING, WE NEED HELP.
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH -- HOW
FAR BEHIND IS CHINA COMPARED TO
THE UNITED STATES?
>> THAT HAPPENED FOR A COUPLE
REASONS.
ONLINE ADVERTISING AS A GLOBAL
BUSINESS IS A MASSIVE BUSINESS.
EVEN AT THAT SIZE, YOU WOULD
NEED -- $200 BILLION THIS YEAR
AND GROWING.
IN CHINA, IT IS GROWING FASTER
THAN THE OTHER MARKETS.
CHINA HAS NATURAL HURDLES THAT
EXIST TO ENTER THE MARKET,
ESPECIALLY FOR FOREIGN
COUNTRIES.
IT IS LESS SOPHISTICATED.
IT IS BEHIND THE U.S..
IT WILL BE A YEAR OR TWO BEHIND
THE U.S., MAYBE MORE.
AT THE SAME TIME, IT HAS A
UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES.
THE CHINA MANDATE MAY NOT JUST
BE TO GROW WITHIN CHINA, WHICH
IS OBVIOUSLY GREAT.
THE OVERALL MANDATE LONG-TERM IS
YOU WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN
OUTBOUND INVESTMENTS FOR
COMPANIES THAT ARE GLOBAL, THAT
HAVE SCALE, A REAL BUSINESS
MODEL THAT WILL BE LONG-TERM
SUSTAINABLE.
THAT IS WHAT MCDONAGH AND
CHAIRMAN ZHANG WANT TO DO.
THE GOAL IS TO NOT ONLY ADD
CHINA AS A MARKET BUT DOUBLE
DOWN ON U.S. AND EUROPEAN
CHALLENGES.
RAMY: YOU ARE AN ENTREPRENEUR.
WHAT IS NEXT?
>> MY PLAN IS TO CONTINUE WITH
THESE GUYS.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY
REASONS WHEN WE HAD SEVERAL
OPTIONS -- THREE OPTIONS FROM
THE U.S., EUROPE, AND CHINA.
THE HIGHEST BID WAS ABOUT 20%.
THE HIGHEST U.S. BID WAS FROM A
WELL-KNOWN PE FUND.
PE FUNDS WOULD WANT TO DISCOUNT
THE VALUE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO
MAKE UPSIDE ON THEIR EXIT.
FROM A VALUE STANDPOINT, WE
THOUGHT WE WERE AT THE SAME
POINT.
THE PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATOR WAS
ALL THESE DIFFERENT VALUE ADDS
IN BEING ABLE TO ACCESS
ADDITIONAL MARKETS, GET ACCESS
TO INCREDIBLE TALENT IN CHINA,
BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL
MARKET, AND LOOK AT DEALS OF
VARIOUS SIZES.
ACROSS THE NEXT FEW YEARS, -- WE
HAVE COMPLETED OUR FIRST PHASE.
WE HAVE HAD A GREAT JOURNEY IN
THIS FIRST PHASE.
AS WE ENTER THE SECOND PHASE OF
GROWTH, WE EXPECT TO MULTIPLY
THE BUSINESS FROM WHERE IT IS
TODAY.
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT.
I AM GOING TO BE A PART OF THAT.
SO IS MY MANAGEMENT TEAM.
WE ARE GOING TO GET LOTS OF
AUTONOMY.

THERE WAS A BOOM IN INVESTMENT
CAPITAL IN 2014.
YOU ARE SEEING THAT TAPER OFF
QUITE A BIT.
IT IS SQUEEZING THE STARTUP

THE CHALLENGES FOR FLIPKART ARE
MORE INTENSE BECAUSE OF THE
TARGETING OF AMAZON INTO THE

AMAZON HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HIRING

IT IS MARKETING AGGRESSIVELY IN

THE E-COMMERCE MARKET IN INDIA.
THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON FLIPKART.
RAMY: WHAT WOULD THEY
SPECIFICALLY NEED TO DO IN ORDER
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FLIPKART
TURNING OVER?
>> WELL, THE MARKET IS GROWING
VERY QUICKLY IN AMAZON.
THE RETAIL MARKET IN INDIA IS
QUITE FRACTURED AT THIS POINT,
EVEN MORE THAN THE U.S..
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOT JUST
SELL GOODS RELIABLY AND GET THEM

YOU NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN
PLACE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT
GROWTH.
AMAZON HAS LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN
THE U.S. AND HAS DONE REASONABLY
WELL IN OTHER MARKETS, BUT THIS
MARKET IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER THEY
HAVE COMPETED IN.
RAMY: HOW CAN FLIPKART MOUNT A
RESPONSE TO AMAZON?
CAN THEY?
>> FLIPKART HAS AN ADVANTAGE
HERE.
THEY ARE AHEAD AT THIS POINT.
THEY ALSO HAVE DOMESTIC
KNOWLEDGE THAT PROBABLY WORKS TO
THEIR ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF
LANGUAGE, CUSTOMIZING APPS,
RECOMMENDATIONS MAKE A BIG
DIFFERENCE, TOO.
THEY HAVE A BIT OF A LEAD, BUT
THEY NEED TO CONTINUE TO
INNOVATE, EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY,
AND ADD MORE MERCHANTS TO STAY
AHEAD OF AMAZON.
RAMY: PETER, STAY RIGHT THERE.
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON
ANOTHER STORY, CHINA SMARTPHONE
MAKERS WITH THEIR SIGHTS SET ON
THE U.S.
DO THEY REALLY STAND A CHANCE?
SHIRA OVIDE IS NOT SO SURE.
SHE JOINS US RIGHT HERE IN NEW
YORK.
WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT
PIECE?
>> THE TAKEAWAY IS WE HAVE SEEN
IN RECENT WEEKS A NUMBER OF
CHINESE HANDSET MAKERS SAYING
THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE U.S.
XIAOMI AND HUAWEI ARE GOING TO
GO AFTER THE U.S. WITH HIGH-END
SMARTPHONES.
THE BATTLE SHOULD BE REALLY
INTERESTING.
RAMY: THE INTERESTING PART IS IN
TERMS OF SPECS?
PRICING?
HOW CAN APPLE AND SAMSUNG DEFEND
THEMSELVES?
>> APPLE AND SAMSUNG IN THE U.S.
DIVY UP THE MARKET.
THEY HAVE OUTSIZED MARKET SHARE
COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE
WORLD.
THE THING THAT IS INTERESTING
ABOUT XIAOMI AND HUAWEI IS
THEY ARE MAKING HIGH-END PHONES
FOR NOT HIGH-END PRICES.
KIND OF AN $800 TOPLINE PRICE WE
HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM SAMSUNG
AND THE IPHONE.
RAMY: WITH XIAOMI, HUGO BARRA
WAS ON BLOOMBERG RECENTLY
TALKING ABOUT THEIR STRONG
INTENT TO GET INTO PLAY.
I WANT TO GET INTO A LITTLE OF
THAT.
>> WE WILL LEAD WITH CHANNELS
THAT ALLOW US TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH A YOUNG GENERATION THAT IS
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TECHNOLOGY.
DEFINITELY GOING TO MAKE OUR WAY
THERE.
RAMY: DO YOU THINK XIAOMI WILL
BE ABLE TO BREAK IN?
>> HUAWEI WILL HAVE A BETTER
CHANCE.
THEY HAVE INCREDIBLE EXPERTISE
IN TELECOM AND CHIPS WHICH HAS
ALLOWED THEM PRICING ADVANTAGE
WHICH XIAOMI DOES NOT HAVE.
IF ANYONE CAN MAKE INROADS, IT
MIGHT BE THEM IN TERMS OF
CHINESE HANDSET MAKERS.
RAMY: PETER, I WANT TO BRING YOU
IN.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT IS
HAPPENING WITH CHINESE AND U.S.
SMARTPHONE MAKERS IN TERMS OF
THEM TRYING TO GET IN THERE?
>> I THINK THE CHINESE
SMARTPHONE MAKERS ARE GOING TO
HAVE A HARD TIME IN THE U.S.
MARKET FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT
REASONS.
I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED
TO THINK ABOUT WHICH OF THESE
COMPANIES IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO
AGGRESSIVELY MOVING TO THE U.S.
XIAOMI IS USING A BUSINESS MODEL
THAT HAS HISTORICALLY NOT WORKED
IN THE U.S.
THEY ARE TRYING TO BYPASS
CARRIERS WITHOUT SUBSIDIES.
U.S. CONSUMERS LIKE TO GET THAT
SUBSIDY WHEN THEY SIGN UP FOR A
CONTRACT.
SELLING TO THEM DIRECTLY ONLINE
HAS BEEN TRIED IN THE PAST AND
IT NEVER WORKS.
IN TERMS OF HUAWEI, THEY HAVE
SOME TECHNOLOGY ADVANTAGES.
THEY JUMPED TO THE TOP OF THE
CHINESE SMARTPHONE MARKET
SERIOUS -- QUICKLY.
BUT THE NAME SETS OFF ALARM
BELLS IN THE U.S. FOR A VARIETY
OF REASONS, NOT ALL OF THEM
NECESSARILY WELL-FOUNDED.
U.S. CARRIERS ARE NOT GOING TO
SUPPORT HUAWEI COMING TO THE
U.S. AND A BIG WAY AND GIVE THEM
THE SUBSIDIES TO TAKE MARKET
SHARE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER
PLAYERS IN CHINA, THOSE
COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE AMBITIONS
TO MOVE INTO THE U.S. MARKET.
HAVING SAID THAT, THE U.S.
MARKET IS TUMULTUOUS.
YOU HAVE SEEN TONS OF CHANGE.
APPLE AND SAMSUNG'S DOMINANCE IS
A BIT OF AN ANOMALY.
RAMY: I WANT TO GET YOUR
THOUGHTS ON CRITICISMS ABOUT
XIAOMI.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT IS
AN ALL-OUT COPYCAT OF APPLE.
DO YOU THINK THIS HAS ANY LEGS
TO IT?
>> HISTORICALLY, XIAOMI HAD I.P.
PROBLEMS GETTING STARTED IN
CHINA.
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE I.P. OTHER
COMPANIES HAD.
THAT HAS CHANGED.
THEY WENT TO MICROSOFT, WHICH
BOUGHT THE NOKIA SMARTPHONE
BUSINESS, AND THEY BOUGHT A TON
OF PATENTS FROM THEM.
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DEFEND
THAT.
AT INDUSTRY GATHERINGS, YOU NEED
I.P. TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.
THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS A
PROBLEM.
RAMY: ANY THOUGHTS OF THREATS OF
LAWSUITS IF THEY COME TO THE
U.S.?
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
IF THERE WILL BE AN I.P. BATTLE.
WE HAVE SEEN THE SMARTPHONE WARS
ON THE PATENT FRONT COOL DOWN
FROM THE DAYS WHEN APPLE AND
SAMSUNG SEEM TO SUE EACH OTHER
EVERYDAY.
RAMY: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
SHIRA, AND PETER.
COMING UP, WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE
OF THE GREATEST BASKETBALL
PLAYERS OF ALL TIME AFTER HE
RETIRES?
WE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT KOBE
BRYANT VENTURE CAPITALIST, NEXT.
♪
RAMY: NYANTEC HAD A BIG JULY
THANKS TO POKEMON GO.
THEY RECORDED MORE ACTIVE U.S.
USERS IN JULY THAN SNAPCHAT,
TWITTER, OR PINTREST.
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER
POKEMON GO CAN KEEP THESE USERS
ENGAGED LONG-TERM.
DATA SHOWS A DECLINE IN
ENGAGEMENT.
DAILY USERS HAVE BEEN IN A SLOW
DECLINE SINCE THEY PEAKED IN MID
JULY.
ANOTHER STORY WE ARE WATCHING.
KOBE BRYANT IS THE WINNER OF
FIVE NBA CHAMPIONSHIPS.
HE IS ADDING SOMETHING ELSE TO
HIS RESUME -- VENTURE
CAPITALISTS.
BRYANT HAS LAUNCHED A FUND
CALLED BRYANT-STEVELE.
THEY TEAM UP TO CREATE A LOS
ANGELES-BASED FUND THAT WILL
FOCUS ON TECH, MEDIA, AND DATA
COMPANIES.
WE WILL SEE IF HE IS AS
SUCCESSFUL AT VENTURE CAPITAL AS
HE WAS A BASKETBALL.
WHO IS HAVING THE BEST THEY
EVER?
INSTAGRAM.
THE APP HAS JOINED THE ONE
BILLION DOWNLOAD CLUB ON GOOGLE
PLAY.
ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND, THE
DOWNLOAD COUNTER DOES NOT
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN UNIQUE
INSTALLATIONS, MEANING ONE USER
COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
MULTIPLE DOWNLOADS.
THIS IS NOT AN EASY FEAT WHEN
YOU CONSIDER ANDROID ONLY HAD
1.4 BILLION USERS AS OF

SHE WON COMEDY TOUR OF THE YEAR.
AMY: I SHOWED UP TO FILM THIS
MOVIE AND I WAS LIKE, I THINK
I'M A MODEL NOW.
I THINK A LOT OF GIRLS ARE LIKE
THIS.
WE HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION IN
THE BACK OF OUR HEADS.
MI, MAYBE, GORGEOUS?
I THINK I'M GORGEOUS.
RIGHT?
I'M GORGEOUS, BUT I JUST HAVEN'T
STUMBLED ON THE RIGHT HERE DO --
HAIR DO.
ONE DAY I WILL CUT BANGS AND
EVERYONE WILL BE LIKE, DAMN, AND
I'M LIKE, TREAT ME THE SAME, YOU
GUYS.
I'M THE SAME PERSON.
AND THEY'RE LIKE, WE CAN'T,
WE'RE TOO HARD.
I'M LIKE, I GET IT.
BUT THEN MY STUNT DOUBLE WAS A
GUY.
JUST IN CASE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TO L.A., IT IS FILLED WITH THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE FROM ALL
OVER THE WORLD.
PICTURE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL
IN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL, THE ONE YOU
WANTED TO BE.
I'M TALKING TO THE GUYS RIGHT
NOW.
AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE, YOU ARE
TOO PRETTY FOR BUFFALO, GO TO
L.A.
EVERYONE IS HOT THERE.
EVERYBODY.
I SAW A GUY CLEANING UP A PIZZA
HUT BATHROOM THAT I WOULD HAVE
PAID THIS GUY TO -- ME.
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN SEE ME THERE.
IS THAT A FAT TUMBLEWEED?
MY BODY TYPE THERE -- MY ARMS
REGISTER AS LEGS THERE.
IS THAT AN OCTOPUS?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
AND MY LEGS ARE USED FOR
FIREWOOD.
AND THAT'S THE SECRET, I FOUND
OUT.
THAT'S HOLLYWOOD'S SECRET.
THEY DON'T PUT FOOD IN THEIR
FACES.
AND THAT'S NOT AN OPTION FOR ME.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS IN YOUR
HOUSE GROWING UP.
YOU WOULD EAT UNTIL YOU WERE IN
A LOT OF PAIN.
THEN YOU TAKE LIKE A LITTLE
BREATHER AND YOU GET YOURSELF
BACK AND EVEN MORE PAIN.
I WAS BORN WEIGHING 150.
I CAME OUT SWINGING.
GIVE ME PIZZA!
THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN.
I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE -- I'VE
NEVER SAID THIS SENTENCE.
I FORGOT TO HAVE LUNCH TODAY.
IF ANYTHING, I WOULD BE LIKE I
HAD TWO LEDGES TODAY.
CHARLIE: SHE HAS A HIT
TELEVISION SHOW CALLED "INSIDE
AMY SCHUMER."
THE SHOW IS SLATED FOR A FIFTH
SEASON, BUT NOT IN THE
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
IT RECEIVED AN EMMY FOR
OUTSTANDING SKETCH SERIES AND A
CRITICS CHOICE AWARDS.
AMY: YOU ARE NOT NOTHING,
YOU ARE NOT OVERWEIGHT.
OK.
HOW DOES A WOMAN WHO DOES NOT
KNOW HOW TO LEARN TO SEW GO ON.

I KNOW, HER NAME BE LIKE -- OH!

I'D BETTER HAVE MY STAR.
IT'S A GETTING FLAG IN HERE SO

CHARLIE: LAST YEAR, SHE WROTE
AND STARRED IN HER FIRST FILM
CALLED "TRAIN WRECK."
THAT FILM MADE MORE THAN $140
MILLION WORLDWIDE.
>> THIS IS MORE COMFORTABLE.
>> I WILL TELL YOU IF I CAN FEEL
IT.
CHARLIE: SHE HAS WRITTEN HER
FIRST BOOK CALLED "THE GIRL WITH
THE LOWER BACK TATTOO."
THE BOOK IS LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY
WHEN SHE WANTED TO BE, BUT MORE
OFTEN IS SURPRISINGLY HONEST AND
RAW.
A SERIES OF ESSAYS THAT RANGE
FROM SUBJECT MATTER FROM BEING A
MEMBER OF NEW MONEY TO WHAT SHE
WANTS PEOPLE TO SAY AT HER
FUNERAL.
LIKE HER COMEDY IN HER LIFE, THE
BOOK RECEIVES HIGH PRAISE.
ALL OF THAT MAKES ME VERY
PLEASED TO HAVE AMY SCHUMER AT
THIS TABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
WELCOME.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
AMY: I KNOW.
ALL THESE YEARS.
I REALLY WANTED TO MAKE YOU
WAIT.
CHARLIE: DID YOU REALLY?

AMY: I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS, ACTUALLY.
KIND OF SINCE I WAS 13.
I WROTE JOURNALS FROM AGE 13 TO
