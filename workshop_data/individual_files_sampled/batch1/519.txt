China is accused of detaining more than a million wagger Muslims u.s. politicians have called for sanctions against the Chinese officials responsible there are reports of torture and indoctrination in secret camps so are the basic religious and cultural rights of an entire people under threat this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I am Hashem AHA bara the International Day of the victims of enforced disappearances is commemorated by the United Nations on Thursday to remember that tens of thousands of people maybe hundreds of thousands abducted by police or government agents in various countries around the world today is inside stories focusing on China and the western region of ching-chong were United Nations Human Rights experts say more than a million ethnic workers are being held in what resembles a massive internment camp shrouded in secrecy a sort of no rights zone China denies such camps exist but says criminals involved in minor offenses are sent to what it calls vocational education and employment training centers to help with their reintegration into society most workers practice Islam and speak a Turkic language that's completely different from Mandarin Chinese ten million of them live mostly in the ching-chong region of western China ethnic tensions have risen over the years since 1949 after the communist government encouraged the mass migration of Han Chinese workers share ethnic and cultural similarities with their neighbors in Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Kazakhstan and Mongolia China says its crackdown in Ching Jan is to protect peace and prevent what it calls terrorism there have been ethnic bias in recent years in where and where separatists have been blamed for several attacks including one in Beijing's chariman square in 2013 let's introduce our panel of experts in Hong Kong Andrew Leung an international and the independent China strategist in Nottingham in the UK andreas folder a lecturer at the University of Nottingham and in Cornell Germany by Skype Adrian's and an expert on China's minority policy welcome to you all mr. Andrew what is happening in the worker areas the UN says this is a forced attempt by the government to change the very identity of the wicked people I think it made the problem at the moment is China's fear of separatism now let's face it as separatism is a no-no for any country including democratic advanced countries like Spain and think about you know so Catalonia but I think in China is even more gives more in forms more anxiety because a shinjang is a large area and of course it's not just the scene Jang and the eager people which is now connected with it Eastern Turkestan terrorist movement elsewhere but also it would drive separatism movements in Tibet and also in even in Taiwan let alone Hong Kong or Macau so I think that China's the Beijing is absolutely anxious to control the situation what has caused the problem if you look at the complexity of all the ethnic groups in China Charlie's a multi-ethnic country consisting of 56 ethnic groups of course the Han Chinese accounts for more than 95 percent of the total population but there are you know sort of over football ethnic groups and the the the Duggars and the Tibetans are causing problems the rest are living in ok great harmony with Hank Chinese but now the reason is because in recent years as you highlighted earlier there is a mass migration of the Han Chinese into sin Jiang and then this Indian people feel that they are being overwhelmed and also as they feel that there's erosion of their culture ok and access to the jobs and so on so forth so the kind of measure suppressive measures is can be counterproductive ok mr. Andreas does the fear of extremism justify putting 1 million people in some sort of defense detention forcing them to change the system of release well first of all I would like to thank you and Al Jazeera for bringing to your audience's attention the fact that hundreds of thousands of weekers are indeed held in political reaction camps in their homeland since young and I've agreed to come to you know on to this show because I believe that facing a situation like that the community of China's calls cannot remain silent to answer your question directly I don't think that any of these measures are justifiable the kind of response we've just heard from Andrew is indefensible because of course separatist movements exist in various countries but they never the existence of dissent never justifies such draconian measures because what we're seeing in mainland China is basically the implementation of a highly racist policy and squarely at an ethnic group where anyone regardless of his or her political or religious views can be swept up in these internment camps and that is a huge problem it's something that we need to talk about because it's unacceptable mm-hmm Adrian are we talking here about a push by the Chinese to contain the rise of what he describes as extremism or a planned attempt by the government to change the identity of an entire people well from the Chinese perspective it is probably both both are being conflated for the Chinese state them any sense of a people being different and especially a sense of people being religious has always been seen by suspicion the whicker's are an ethnic group that have had a different historic and linguistic and cultural identity for a long time as a matter of fact very few of them are seriously interested in some kind of independence but the problem is that the Chinese have long had a sense of cultural distance to these people therefore for the Chinese state in many ways reducing cultural difference or linguist big difference and especially reducing or suppressing religious identity is equivalent to counterterrorism and that's in many ways what we are seeing in India Sir Andrew Liang the Chinese government has said over the past few months they basically trying to improve the living standards of the people in the wigger area but here's a problem with the with this particular approach I mean how can you defend some sort of Orwellian Big Brother Society in modern times and say that people need to go to medication centers to be sort of indoctrinated I mean who accept such a a policy in these days I think there is no doubt that in the so-called inner problems in China include such as Xin Jiang and also Tibet and some of the more remote provinces the economic development has been a phenomenal I mean the GDP per capita the life expectancy the literacy rates by all measures that are improving but then on the other hand there is a cultural and ethnic religious divide between the Han Chinese as well as the the native groups particularly in Incendia and Tibet for example they because the these are rather remote areas in the past and so they they tend to regard their culture as segregated from the earth from the other groups in major ethnic groups like the Han Chinese in China for a long long time but nevertheless it's not as if they were completely segregated if you look at history back in the even the the Ming Dynasty or the chain dynasty in a dating back several hundred years ago they were already about 30% of the Han Chinese their ethnic hang group engineering problems but then the in recent years the problems of ethnic conflict seem to have flare up because the division between the access to the jobs to markets has become much more pronounced and there was even a much much larger number of Han Chinese settling in room room she and others and the other problem is of course the Sultan Tibet which is the area which is associated with the eastern Turkestan movement and and that is linked together with other you know sort of terrorist groups elsewhere and of course some day that there have been in recent years quite a number of terrorist activities China okay and of course China's as China grows in in national gravitas is subject to to all these perceived threats from the from the West a right wing ideology okay so that that's why there was a feedback there of repressive measures okay mr. Andreas are we talking here about just to to if to further explain the holyshit our our audience are we talking about ethnic discrimination religious persecution or is there is more to this particular story about the Chinese government and the wiggers sure I mean I think when we just listen to Andrew it's quite clear that we shouldn't be hoodwinked by these kind of phony arguments about development status etc the real issue here is that the China most part is using extra traditional extrajudicial measures to imprison Chinese citizens because we curse of course Chinese citizens against its own laws so for example when you read the legal commentary about the situation there are actually no rules and regulations that justify these actions the choice course party is of course not bound by the rule of law it uses the rule by law to govern China but there is no constitutional basis or no law that no Chinese law that allows the indefinite interment of people now of course there is now a law that exists which is the counterterrorism law which allows for what's called educational placement and that could indeed be indefinite but anyone who is then placed under such educational placement would have to be indicted first on terrorist charges go through a legal process of imprisonment and then after being released from prison then this could you know take place but clearly a hundred thousand close to a million of we girls who are ending up in this in in these camps they are not terrorists they're probably not even close to terrorist sympathizers so to justify that by any measure is highly problematic okay adri√°n activists have been saying that for example in 2017 one-fifth of all the arrestee in China have been made in the Qin Jung region could this be an indication that the government has completely failed to find a political way out of the problem and that's now moving one notch further to worse harsh measures the government if we look at this historically has tried a several approaches in the 1990s and early 2000s we see a developmental approach with the Great Western developed up an initiative that the belief that large injections of funding from the top down would make a profound change in the region course this has caused many problematic side effects such as an influx of handset plus the next strategy was to bring in attention to a strong man who formerly ruled Tibet and he recruited tens of thousands close to a hundred thousand new police building thousands of new police stations installing sophisticated surveillance technology facial recognition cameras now the interesting thing is this react occasion dry represents an entirely new dimension something that we have not seen in other parts of China on this scale in recent history not in Tibet either so this is the next level and I believe we can only speculate in some ways what the actual reasons are but I believe that the Chinese government feels you can't just put a police man next to every Weger they're looking for a long-term solution what is the long-term solution it is as government's documents call it and story repeaters it is as government documents call it seeking a heart changed so the long-term change is to drop early change an entire people resulting however in the criminalization of the entire belief system mm-hmm ok mr. Andrew I mean in theory change young is considered an autonomous region with a self-appointed local government but you know everyone knows that the guy who caused the final shots is Chen Shuang war the man who has been in Tibet known for his harsh measures and Iron Fist policy many are concerned that the man is trying to completely clamp down on dissent and opposition in the changing region well I think this is a vicious circle the more Beijing is anxious about the separatist movements and the perpetration of terrorist acts and the perceived foreign interference in trying to ferment at her fragmentation of China the more Beijing tightens the grip but that that is counterproductive as I was saying on the one hand of course the economic benefits and infrastructural links with the rest of the provinces would help the the these remote regions to grow but on the other hand you're talking about as you're talking about sorry trillions their ethnic Basanti I'm sorry to interrupt you here but you're talking about the changing region as a poor area it has massive natural resources potential it's a rich region on its own the problem is not this the problem is purely about persecution here yeah as I was saying the the these repressive measures are counterproductive and there is a vicious circle the more Beijing imposes these measures on a sector sector of the of these scenes young people the more they are likely to to feel estranged and and and and and reactive against the Beijing government so I think that that's but on the other hand there is no way that the Beijing would just let go because this is an existential threat the whole whole country and in fact no country will allow separative you're talking about 11 million people out of a national saying more than a billion people I mean why would this be considered as an existential threat this this should be the core of democracy respecting the rights of the minorities and under well I mean if you look at the area of seen Jiang it is huge I mean it is one of the largest provinces in China and so in even in in terms of numbers that may be okay relatively small percentage but on the other hand there is a and an impact and an effect what about Tibet in fact also you look at a number of Tibetan people the number is not that large but all that on the other hand the province is again he okay and not only the in terms of size but in terms of as you mentioned earlier resources and the activity of China with a barren row for the rest of the world let's talk a little bit now about the International reaction this is going to be my question to Andrea's I mean there's been a report by the United Nations about a few weeks ago now there's this letter by US senators and congressmen saying that there needs to be some strong robust reaction particularly imposing sanctions on the individuals companies on anyone responsible for the atrocities committed against the Wicker people do you think that the Americans would follow suit and take action well first of all Jessica vodka from China file made the suggestion and I think it's a very good suggestion to US policymakers to make good use of the global Magnitsky Act which allows the American government to block the property the overseas property of individuals who have engaged in endemic human rights abuses and corruption now I would think that the strongman chen chen cheng or very likely qualifies for a being subject to the global Magnitsky act and this is something that could be considered more widely because I think for the international community whether it's the United States the European Union or any other country to just turn a blind eye to the situation in Xinjiang is not an option if any one of your viewers are rightly concerned for example about the racist immigration policies of the Trump administration where families are being ripped apart bear in mind that what's happening in Shenyang is far worse the the scope of the problem is far bigger and that much more families of being ripped apart as we speak and many of the children of the imprisoned weekers are actually now growing up in Chinese orphanages now I think that is totally and utterly unacceptable we have an obligation to speak out about these kind of things and I think a very practical step beyond government is that people around the world should educate themselves about what is happening in Xinjiang by the news for example a dialog from the Asia Research Center China dialogue from University of Berkeley or China filed from the Asia Society which have been doing excellent work on on Xinjiang and bringing information up-to-date information about the simulation on the ground Adrian in a country like China which has historically been thin-skinned when it comes to international criticism do you think that if we build up momentum if there's been a momentum in the of the UN EU the u.s. that could pay off or ultimately end up being counter productive now on the one hand there is a possibility that the Chinese position will be hardened by being challenged in an international way however we also need to consider that the Chinese are at a time where they are really trying to convince the rest of the world of their progress of their developments and in a sense of their eternal ative understanding of the world order therefore the Chinese I think are inherently interested in how they're being perceived especially in a context now of the baton road initiative now Xin young of course is a so-called core hub off the baton Road initiative nearly all transport that goes on land routes passes for shin heung a lot of the strategic economic development is happening there therefore I believe if this is being raised internationally in a consistent and systematic way what's happening in Xinjiang today I believe this is actually very necessary mm-hmm and hardening the Chinese position I still believe it is a risk that should be taken mm-hmm mr. Andrew we're talking about at the end of the day we're talking about China one of the biggest economies in the world and many governments are scared to the point of raising this issue where the Chinese government is this something that you think could embolden the Chinese government to continue its clamp down on the wiggers well I mean this is not the first time percieve purchase violations of human rights raised their eyebrows in the West and in fact China has been taken to task in many forums including United Nations and other venues but I think that at this particular time again raising this question in a more aggressive way against China could feed into this kind of vicious circle because I think that there is a perception now with the trade war with the United States with the the West raising various concerns about China there is a perception that the whole world is ganging up against China in more ways than one economically financially militarily and now ideologically but on the other hand it is right and proper for the West to to raise these issues but I think there are many other ways as well that to engage the Chinese government okay especially through programs or think tanks or academic forums and and even cooperation with various NGOs mr. Andreas I I think that it's right and proper for these to be raised but one has got to understand where China is coming from we do we do Andrea's this is going to be my last question in less than a minute please in this strange world as Andrew Leung was basically saying we're the populist are taking over where they far-right governments now are emerging do you think that the minorities will have to wait a long time before they can have their own rights respected what suddenly I think one of the issues is that Chinese citizens are those who reside within the People's Republic of China and those who're living all over the world they have to pay attention as well and I think I don't think that the choice comes party actually acts in their name the things that happen in Shenyang probably most Chinese people choices and are not aware of if they are aware I think they would take a very critical view of such government actions and I think ultimately it will depend on how Chinese citizens view this angel' young andreas folder Adrian Zan's thank you very much indeed looking forward to seeing you in the near future and thank you again for watching the program you see it's inside story again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside sorry you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at AJ inside story for me Hashim I help out on the whole team here bye for now you you
