James Thompson he is running Kansas fourth district he's a just Democrat you might have seen him on the eros Network before he was on before his primary was on the night of his primary after he won now he's in the general election against Ron Estes again I said Estes again because they were in a special election recently James welcome back to TYT thank you so much Jake I am so excited to be here things are going great here and thank you for having me on no problem so I want to talk a little bit about Estes and your strategy to beat them so I want to give people context here so Democratic Party was not heavily invested in that special election that happened in April of 2017 and and I don't know where they are today you'll have to fill us in on the latest but partly because that's the district that had gone to Republicans by 30 points but in your special election you you did wind up losing Asus but by only six points so you close the gap by 24 points let's just start with for those who have not seen you before how'd you do that well we did it with getting out and running a true grassroots campaign we talked to people we went door-to-door we had involvement in the community and that really paid off for us you know we did not get the investment from the National Party so we were doing this on our own we got out there and fought for every single boat we knocked on 40,000 doors we had $300,000 300,000 had got in investments we got a big pile of money in right in the last three or four days of the campaign because daily coach recognizes if we had got that just a week earlier we could have probably flipped this district and I think we would have had a much different result the problem is is we got the money in a little bit too late and we were struggling trying to find things to spend money on yeah and I know that the commercials get taken up at the end of a campaign hour and are more expensive so there's a better way to do it but luckily a at least six weeks to go now so people act now they can make a giant difference in this race I want to get to the latest poll in a second but I want everybody to already know what the links are okay boat James Thompson calm and and to volunteer vote James Thompson comm slash volunteered to donate tinyurl.com / donate to Thompson and and I hope that people came back a candidate that's real progressive in the heart of Kansas etc but tell us about the latest polls I know though there was it's not that recent but in July how close were you DAST us you know in July we did a poll right before Bernie Sanders and Alexandria LoCascio Cortez came here and did their rally with us and we were just down four points essentially we worth in the margin of error there and the other thing about that the more important thing that came out of that poll is it showed a ton of Republicans and independents in this district as undecided at that point as well so we have a ton of people out there that we can get we need to start pulling them over and the way to do that is with those media buys I mean we've attacked on social media we've done that a lot but the fact is is getting on TV with media buys is the way to do it and that's one of the things that we're hoping for from your viewers because media here is seventy-six dollars a point now in comparison you look to California in LA you're at 240 to $300 a point and that means that basically for $400,000 what you would buy in LA would cost you about $100,000 here $100,000 buy on media here would put us over the top we could win this and we could crush Estes and keep Coe Bach off the air as well yes so I won't talk about Estes in a second too but I want people to understand how efficient James's campaign has been so in there was a couple general elections I'm sorry special elections around the same time there was James election in Kansas and then there was one in Georgia in Georgia the Democrats spent two hundred and thirty dollars per vote and they wound up losing how much did you guys spend per voter eleven dollars and forty seven cents per vote is what we spent we they spent more than 20 times more than us in the Oh soft race there in Georgia for a result that actually did worse than what Hillary had done we on the other hand we we use your money efficiently when it's given to us because we know we have to because we don't have corporate PAC money coming in you guys are our super PAC it's the people that are our super PAC and we take that money and we're able to get $11 and 47% or $0.47 boat price per votes here which is better than any of the other elections out there last year I mean we really scrimped and saved and made sure that we stretched every dollar so James like just Democrats so he doesn't think any corporate PAC money the average donation has actually been exactly $27 so I think I've seen that somewhere before James vote James Thompson comm is the website now let's talk about your opponent so this district is particularly important because it's the home base of two brothers I think the last name is Coke so has Ron S has taken money from the Koch brothers most definitely has he is taking money from them he's taking money from their packs his wife was the state director for Americans for Prosperity here so he's got you know a main line of money from the Koch brothers a win here is going to be huge because it sends a message to the entire country that progressive movements people standing on progressive values can stand up to the biggest donors in this country the biggest people that are pushing against this with their corporate PACs and still win you know Ron Estes is a do nothing puppet for the Koch brothers and for president Trampas in fact so we have an opportunity here to send a big message that we're tired of it and the people in Kansas are tired of it because we were dealing with the Brownback tax experiment long before Ron Estes and his cronies took it to Washington and imposed it on a national level so we know the results of that and we are tired of it here in Kansas yeah so it's the Koch brothers backyard that's their home district unsurprising that they purchased Ron Estes that representative with their donations James's uncorruptible he doesn't take any of those corporate PAC money but let's talk about a couple of things and how they might affect Estes in that district he voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act that was actually his first vote but he also voted for the GOP tax plan that of course his donors the Koch brothers were thrilled with they they they don't get along with Trump exactly right but they love that what Trump and Estes did in that regard but so we're led to believe that in a red district of in a red state like Kansas well that's gonna play really well is that what you're seeing or no the what we're seeing here is people are ready for something different and they they are noticing this at a recent pachyderm meeting here the Republicans were complaining about not being able to get the word out and having trouble with their messaging because people weren't having it anymore and so what we're seeing is people are responding to the progressive discussions that we're having when we're talking about making sure that we have medical care available for every single person in the United States making sure that everybody can get educated people are responding to that now the other side of that though to Jake is that our district is the hardest hit in the entire country by these tariffs that mr. Trump are President Trump has voted on because we have agriculture and manufacturing as are two main industries here we are tired of being the the tip of their sword as they you know ramming it through us here we have an opportunity to do something different and but that requires everybody jumping in with us and helping us out and if everybody that's watching right now could tip in chip in five or ten dollars we could flip this district by being able to get that media Buy yeah vote James Thompson calm if I wasn't clear enough so as this I imagine backs Trump the overwhelming majority of the time me and and so as the tariffs hit your district using estus is partly responsible for that he's definitely responsible he should be standing up every day on the House floor yelling at the top of his lungs that our district is suffering because of these horrible tariffs and he's not he is a rubber stamp he is going to go along with whatever the Koch brothers and/or Trump tell him to do and you know we've seen it in his voting they are wanting to basically take the 1.5 trillion dollars that they got with their tax cuts they're wanting to then turn around and take that back from the people that need it most Medicare Social Security Medicaid these are the things that they're wanting to cut to pay for their you know corporate PACs and their or the corporate buddies and their yachts we have to make sure that we're standing up people here a tired of it I'm sure the people out there are tired of it as well James got about a minute left so what's the top issue that you're running on that appeals most the people in your district the thing that appeals most of the people in my district are veterans and then getting money out of politics people here on both sides of the aisle are just tired of it they're tired of seeing corporate PAC money being used to spread lies and disinformation instead of actually coming out and talking to people and then the other thing is that my opponent won't actually debate me so we're working class district people want to hear from their representative and Ron Estes won't come out and say anything because he's a coward damn that's how James rolls he by the way founded the veterans legal association as well so James thank you for joining us vote James Thompson comm is a website we'll have the links down below if you're watching this later on YouTube or Facebook those donations make all the difference against these guys backed by the Koch brothers and by all those corporate PACs James thanks so much for joining us again really appreciate it hey thank you James thank you so much and thank you everybody you
