66
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,510
checking account you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> free ipad</font>

67
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,820
mini so I'm definitely gonna go hook

68
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,320
myself up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iPad Mini that's</font>

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,540
for sure hey guys what's up so I just

70
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,720
went to RBC bank and the deal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as</font>

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,370
sweet as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to be so you</font>

72
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,310
have to sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their bank account</font>

73
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,560
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs fifteen dollars a month so</font>

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,440
that works out here like around 180

75
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,550
bucks for the year and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

76
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,700
have a direct payroll deposit going in

77
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,540
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this just for the ipad mini</font>

78
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would have to somehow</font>

79

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,310
money from their back to my other

82
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,740
account it should be really confusing so

83
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,990
I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not gonna do it I</font>

84
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,640
really wanted to give the ipad mini but

85

i mean i'm already paying for half of it

86
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,680
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> from doing the because you have to</font>

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,330

92
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,460
choice for me to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i might</font>

93
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,930
is definitely going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a lot of</font>

94
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,970
hassle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you close your account</font>
