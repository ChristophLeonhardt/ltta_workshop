last week Ben mankiewicz and I called on Senate Democrats to shut down the Senate until uh the Trump care debate becomes somewhat more transparent and so clearly they were listening or they did it for some other reason but it is happening they are shutting down the Senate and that is good news starting Monday Democrats will object to all requests in ascent to proceed to any business on the Senate floor which requires unanimous consent or vote that requires the support of 60 votes so the sort of typical regular stuff that you do in the Senate that they just go along with they don't fight they're going to start fighting because of the secrecy that is shrouded the AHCA writing or crafting we don't know we don't know exactly what's going on because of how secret it is uh in addition a Senate Democrats will sit their seats on the Senate floor Monday night to attempt to force the house-passed health care bill the HCA to the relevant committees they'll also attempt to delay any impending health care vote which you come up as early as next week so until the discussion of the Senate version of Trump care uh gets actually discussed in there's some information about it they're going to be shutting things down and they're also bringing the the House version back up the version which uh Donald Trump recently called mean yeah uh this is great I mean they're gonna be roll call vote after roll call vote after if you think watching the Senate is dull and I tell you I do it all the time and nobody's duller than me if you it's gonna get even duller because they're just gonna begin with these you Nana they they buy a quote by acclamation do a lot of unanimous consent where they it's just assumed without objection so ordered well there's objection now and it's gonna keep going going uh it's a great device to use I mean the Republicans are using their devices in the device of the majority which they're they're perfectly in the right to do uh but that's why they're the minority does have some power and Chuck Schumer is going to wield it and I think it's great i mean i think it's it's getting people to pay attention to something that was just gonna sneak on by this legislating by cover of darkness that they're trying to get away with is just so i know that you hear this and some of these sound bites it's on american but it really is against the american process and there has to be some kind of transparent debate even as politicized as the whole system is and were divided so much over this to me I was trying to think of when there was something like this before cuz it doesn't usually happen where they try and RAM something through get a vote and have it dispatched with the Patriot Act the Patriot Act was like that the creation of the Department Homeland Security a little bit like that but because there were so many other agencies involved it got slowed down but the Patriot Act John is right I mean I to me that was one of the ones but you had more people and at a time when the atmosphere after 9/11 was will do anything and then you know people were we're not thinking in the same way that they are now it's not as evenly or unevenly frankly divided over over that yeah and and look we we have to acknowledge as we have in all over coverage of this that this is about is unpopular a bill as is ever discussed in the Senate I mean you don't a recent Fox News poll put it 17% approval that's Fox News you don't have bills with 17% approval the Senate because they would have made it this far there are you still being discussed you have powers that are that not that unpopular like Iraq but you III mean that's absolutely true and it's remarkable that this is they're gonna push this through just by or or try to push this to just by force a political power was the least popular bill you say whatever yeah bill laimbeer that's the answer it's a joke it's a sports joke it's an old one mark would get it you wouldn't you not even if you lived in Detroit you would get but I had this which I did not um so uh I want to get comments from a couple of Democrats about their strategy are first that Chuck Schumer said if Republicans won't relent and debate their health care bill in the open for the American people to see and they shouldn't expect business as usual in the Senate Republicans are drafting this bill in secret because they're ashamed of it plain and simple which is also my belief but let's also go to senator Bernie Sanders about his concerns about the secrecy over the HCA John here is the situation we know the legislation that passed the house it was the worst piece of legislation frankly against working-class people that I can remember in my political life in the Congress for 123 million people off of health insurance is beyond belief now in the Senate what you have is you have I believe it is 10 publicans working behind closed doors to address one-sixth of the American economy that's what health care is Republicans the average Republican doesn't even know what's in that legislation my understanding is that will be brought forth just immediately before we have to vote on it this is completely unacceptable and that's why I think that their strategy is great on two levels on the first level if they can get people to stop and slow this process down get the media to focus on a little bit more get people to think about it a little bit more it might actually hurt the chances the bill goes forward that actually gets uh becomes law so that would be great uh but also like they they need in the Senate the House Democrats all over the place need to show the people that they're not going to simply sit by and allow Trump and the Republicans to just to destroy working families to throw tens of millions of people off their health insurance to break to cause businesses to go bankrupt cost people to die that they're going to fight because if they don't fight on this I mean what are they fighting for it they didn't put up much of a fight for the Supreme Court see a little bit but not much and this is about as high tier as legislation you'll see next four years will be maybe something like the tax bill is on via a similar level but perhaps not as big they need to fight now and hopefully they're at least start and a tax bill John comes up periodically yeah once healthcare is done with the exception of what the would Republicans have done to or to the ACA it's usually they walk away and they move on to the next big social issue taxes come up often so that's why this is even more different than that and even you know this is their one chance to defend it in this way and I think it's I think it's good that they're doing it I also think like you said I also think it's gonna change some Republican minds once Republicans start hearing what's in it Bernie Sanders said something when he said not even Republicans know what's in there well it's not just the voters it's people that are colleagues of senator Sanders who who don't know what's in this bill and they can't like that they can't like that and they can't answer for these are people who run for their jobs and they'll say you voted for this without knowing what's in it how could you have done that and that's that's a hard thing to take onto the trail and and Sanders does something so well and he throughout the presidential campaign there well here and that is he sort of distilled the problems with the situation so effectively the Democrats are gonna have to find other people besides Bernie Sanders to communicate that same thing in order to as Johnson sort of build their brand around defending the people and a large part of the population that'll be screwed over this legislation goes through so it seems to me that they're gonna have to find the right way to communicate that Bernie Sanders has found it they're gonna have to find others who can communicate today Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren held a sort of live uh thing where they were taking questions from people on social media answering about this topic I look I said on Twitter they should make this a frequent thing like it doesn't have to be dissin health insurance like have this accountability will get people more involved in the system and especially when you're putting such popular politicians forward there's one other aspect on this uh the HCA Trump care what everyone call is incredibly unpopular and we've broken down any number of times lots of good reasons for that but we've got a new one for you it's coming about as a result of a study by the Commonwealth Fund uh which had some good news for people who like Trump care want to get it passed they said that in the immediate passage of the House version of this bill you would see some new jobs created because they would get rid of these uh that the taxes and theoretically that would lead to some more hiring we can disagree with whether that would actually happen I'm just telling you that that's what they say is going to happen but it is going to be short-lived if you look a little bit farther out this bill will be devastating for jobs by 2026 nine hundred and twenty four thousand jobs would be lost Gross State product would be 93 billion dollars lower and business output would be 148 billion dollars less and of those nearly 1 million jobs about 3/4 of a million will be lost from the healthcare field one of the fastest growing sectors of the American economy and so this is now out there on top of all of those other devastating numbers you know people who the loser insurance the people who die prematurely it also will kill possibly a million jobs that's just by 2026 if it stays law for longer god only knows what the overall that Achille continues right and this is from the jobs jobs jobs president yeah uh and it's unclear I mean if anyone doesn't know it's in this bill is Donald Trump I mean uh he's yeah I also think it's unfair to call the jobs jobs jobs President honestly he he said that a couple of times many times he's not the anything president there's nothing that he I mean that was a mantra of his but it was as throwaway as anything else he said on the trail so there's nothing that has defined his presidency because it's so haphazard so I I don't want to honor him by saying he's the anything I'm not honoring him but I think substantively that is something based on and he had a tweet within the last two weeks where you know he finishes it with the jobs jobs jobs exclamation brash saying no please don't misunderstand me I'm not saying that he is that he's passionately defending the worker or enterprising new jobs for America he's clearly doing neither yeah what I'm saying is that he wants to wrap himself that way and at some point the reality is going to catch up with his rep and it's the reality that you just heard John described it might not catch up for him in his own head but some of his supporters will catch up and and for the record I think he's the scream at the television while eating a hot pocket president personally he's been consistent on only that so far Young Turks now has over six billion lifetime views you know who did that you did that we're now larger the CNN ABC you name a news network online were larger than them and you built all that as everyone scoffed and didn't believe and here we are guys thanks to you build in the meta media together with us at TYT Network dot-com slash join
