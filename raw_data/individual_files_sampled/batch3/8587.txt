AND THE COUNTRY AFFECTED IS FIGHTING BACK. CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CORKE HAS DETAILS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THESE TARIFFS ARE TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. THE WHITE HOUSE'S DECISION TO IMPLEMENT NEW TARIFFS ON STEEL AND IMPORTS FROM CANADA, MEXICO, AND THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD FAN THE WINDS OF A GLOBAL TRADE WAR OR SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE DAYS OF MASSIVE U.S. TRADE BALANCE IS AN UNFAIR AND ACCURATE SOMATIC MARKET ACCESS ARE OVER.
