look at this new news the terrorist himself isn't shy about chatting about his buddy Trudeau he's giving interviews a powder the terrorist is here let me quote a few lines from this Canadian Press story I'm reading it as you can see from The Globe and Mail but it was another newspapers as well let me quote a man convicted of attempted murder who was invited to a dinner reception with Justin Trudeau in India says he has a friendly relationship with the Prime Minister and stayed away to save him from further embarrassment oh so he's friends with Trudeau and he just chose to not go to the dinner so it's not to embarrass his friend well Trudeau's office denies that it's not true let me quote some more from the story but the Prime Minister's office says there is no merit to the assertions by Jaspal Atwal who was convicted of attempted murder in the 1980s especially the claim that he and Trudeau were friends unquote well who should we believe here well at whoa was happy to meet with reporters at length to answer their questions let me put a bit more from the story we know each other he knows my name he'll come and say hey jazz how are you doing we have a good relationship I never see any problem he said in the interview on Saturday but now he says Oh jazz was not supposed to be here this and that it surprised me Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmed said the Prime Minister and hathwell are not friends that is not true Ahmad said in an interview asked about the HMMWV conversation they had a conversation in this car hamid said i don't know what he's referring to there but no they are not friends unquote well look if you want to know if someone's Trudeau's friend you you have to ask Trudeau how would a Trudeau assistant who's been working some of the time for Trudeau for a couple of years how would he possibly know the truth about who is or isn't friends with Trudeau why won't Trudeau himself answer those questions here's some more I'm pulling them from the story again he said he was traveling in India last week this is the terrorist on a personal trip said the terrorists and question why sura√≠h that's the MP being blamed he's taking the blame alone for his imitation of the reception quote I don't know why he's taking all the responsibility he had nothing to do with that he said the High Commissioner they're the one giving the invitation everyone's name goes through CSIS and the RCMP this is the terrorist himself say this okay so who should we believe the terrorists Atwal was very forthcoming I mean the guy's an attempted murderer so maybe he's an attempted liar it could be but what he says seems to check out here's a picture from years ago with Trudeau and atfal that's a to all the terrorists on the right and here's another picture with Trudeau and at wall that's at wall on the left they seem to be pretty chummy I mean how many times have you met with Trudeau again and again and again that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the yeas relevant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
