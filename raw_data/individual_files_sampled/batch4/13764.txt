apparently there's been a wild upswing in the amount of murder in London well that's not a tremendous shock considering that the demographics of London have changed that the policing in London has changed wildly that the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is really terrible at his job but the murder rate in London now outstrips the murder rate in New York which is pretty incredible actually right the murder rate in Britain has always been extraordinarily low this is why when people say well you know you ban guns in Britain that's why the murder rate is low the murder rate was low before the bans on guns and the murder rate in Britain was always quite low but here is here is what it says according to today online on Thursday April 5th five teenagers were stabbed in an hour and a half before sunset including a boy of 13 all these attacks took place in London over the past week part of an apparent spike in violence in the British capital after a long period of steady declines in violent crime the city has averaged in excess of three killings a week so far this year more than 50 people have been killed in London since the start of 2018 the total for all of 2017 a year when the city suffered multiple deadly terrorist attacks was 116 criminologists have expressed caution about drawing conclusions from only a few months figures but if the uptick continues it will amount to London's highest level of violence in more than a decade a year with 200 homicides for a city of 8.5 million people would be far from a shocking high in the u.s. New York City had 292 murders last year according to the 2018 police commissioner's report that was record low but right now London's murder rate is outstripping the murder rate in New York City which is again a pretty incredible thing so I do love what they are now talking about in London they're not talking about banning knives no joke so they're using the exact same logic they used about guns and now they're applying it to knives so Sadiq Khan has announced a broad new knife control policy designed to keep quote/unquote weapons of war out of the hands of it wanders looking to cause others harm the UK Parliament is considering bills that restrict the manufacture and purchase of kitchen cooking knives because they have points on them because they're pointy things so I guess machetes would still be okay like the one that that guy used a couple of years ago that that Muslim terrorists used to chop down an actual British soldier on the streets of on the streets of London and that'll still be okay because as we all know machetes aren't really dangerous like him from every horror film we know machetes aren't dangerous only knives are dangerous but they're going to start determining how exactly knives are distributed the tough immediate measures involve an incredible police crackdown a ban on home deliveries of knives and acid and expanding law enforcement stop and search powers so the police may stop anyone they believed to be a threat or planning a knife or acid attack Khan announced Friday the city has created a quote violent crime task force 120 officers tasked with rooting out knife wielding individuals in public spaces and is pumping nearly 50 million dollars into the Metropolitan Police Department so they can better armed themselves against knife attacks he's also empowering the Met Police to introduce targeted patrols of extra stop and search powers for areas worst-affected according to a statement now one of the what's what's really kind of hilarious here is that one of the reasons that the crime rate is going up is because Khan is responsible for according to Emily's inaudi at the Daily wire for decreasing the number of stop and searches having previously declared the tactic racist and potentially Islamophobic so in other words got rid of stop and stop and frisk in London saying that it was targeting too many young Muslim guys and then the crime rate went up and now he's gonna target everyone it's not really clear what they're gonna use in London to cut their food anymore if you can't get a home delivery of a knife and if you're not allowed to carry at home how do you actually get the knife from the department store home Parliament is set to take up heavy knife control legislation when it resumes this week the UK government is expected to introduce a ban on online knife sales and home knife deliveries so now you have to go to a store to purchase a knife maybe it's have a license to purchase a knife you have to be would it be a kuelen area specialist they declare it illegal to possess zombie knives and knuckle dusters in private zombie knives are those defined as being manufactured for the purpose of being used as a person-to-person weapon and banned sales of cost materials to anyone under the age of 18 of course that won't really stop anything since most of these asset attacks that have been occurring are occurring among people who are late teenagers or older London seen a dramatic uptick in murder rates of course so again it ain't about the knives folks maybe you ought to look at the people who are wielding the knives maybe you ought to be looking at the people who are actually performing the acid attacks but since we're not allowed to do that we're gonna crackdown our knives and then we'll crack down on fists and then we'll crack down on any blunt object in your home you want to be allowed to have blunt object soon we'll end up all sitting in blank rooms with no furniture because anything can be used maybe baby pillows but no we can use pillows for suffocation so eventually I'll just walk him around like John Travolta in the bubble boy because that presumably will stop crime not actually targeting criminals pretty amazing stuff but demonstrates what happens when an entire civilization loses their mind and stops targeting criminality and starts instead pretending that the tools of criminality are more important than the criminals themselves
