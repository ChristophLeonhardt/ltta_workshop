the world of sports continues its fight against doping the president of the International Olympic Committee has made a very honest and a very sad admission hoping will always happen this is one of the walls you cannot win those words did not sit well with the chief of the US anti-doping agency Travis Tygart it's obviously a tough fight but the leader of sport or anti-doping can't simply throw in the towel he probably has a point especially since doping scandals have hit Taggarts own turf just this week alone to us athletes received lengthy bans for substance abuse that's while pundits blame anti-doping officials for turning a blind eye when it comes to domestic sport or rather multi-billion businesses like the NFL but Thomas back strong words weren't the trigger for you saddest criticism Tygart assumed that the IOC presidents quote was essentially a precursor to water reinstating the Russian anti-doping agency at the meeting scheduled for September 20th but did say that he hoped Russia had learned it's lesson the hard way and would be welcomed back into the world of sports and that was something Tygart stressed must not happen but be a devastating blow to Russia's excuse me to widest credibility as well as the hopes and dreams of millions of athletes around the world who believe in clean and fair competition Russia and its anti-doping agency have been imprisoned for several years now after the publication of the so-called McLaren report which detailed accusations of a state-sponsored doping program the result many Russian athletes banned the country's anti-doping agency effectively shut down and wada handing over a lengthy criteria list for resada to be reinstated last year the agency acknowledged that 19 of 31 points had been met and just this month the president of wada said there were only two conditions remaining two of 31 but they still had to be purified I think relationships are goods to the point that we have yet to purify the two conditions that are still outstanding sure more needs to be done with new akiza and new anti-doping investigations Russia still has three weeks to put things right so has Tiger jumped the gun in demanding Russia to be kept out the final two criteria we're talking about Russia is supposed to say hands up the McLaren report was right we did engage in state-sponsored doping Russia is absolutely rejected the McLaren reports finding not because they don't believe he brushes quite rightly said we want the evidence Thomas Bach himself has requested the evidence and so far nobody has seen it apart we presume from McLaren it is only a guess at this stage but I think the first steps to a reinstatement will be taking place towards the end of September when there is a big meeting of water and I think that the the outcome will be that Russia will be readmitted I don't think it will be an unconditional reinstatement but eventually I think people will just have to say well okay Russia are not admitting that there's been state-sponsored doping but we need them anyway they are a world power in sports and sport needs Russia keeping sport clean is something that both the IOC president and head of US anti-doping agency are striving to achieve but can you really demand one thing from another country when similar doping scandals break out in your own backyard one thing's for sure the next water meeting in the Seychelles is looking like politics and doping will go down the finish line you
