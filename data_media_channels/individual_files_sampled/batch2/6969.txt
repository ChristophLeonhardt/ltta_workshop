Antarctica is absolutely huge but it could become just a little bit smaller any day now what will become possibly the largest iceberg in human history could break off from Antarctica literally any minute it could be while we're filming this let's bring up this graphic I want to show you an area of Antarctica the Larsen sea ice shelf and you see a line cutting across there it was a rapidly spreading crack in the ice and we're talking about well over a hundred mile long crack that that was advancing in real time and now we're talking about a crack that is extended over 120 miles only about three miles of ice are left keeping this massive iceberg attached to the Shelf that it's on so a tiny little fraction still there and that could go there you're seeing that that gigantic crack that's keeping such a huge area oh I'm gonna give you the numbers but just man take it in intercourse so huge Jesus I don't think anybody and no nobody knew that crack is continuing to expand so let's talk about what will happen when this thing falls off the the Larsen shelf there satellite measurements show that the eventual iceberg will average 620 feet thick and contain about 277 cubic miles of ice that's about 1 trillion tons of ice that is suddenly going to detach there and theoretically could either break up or stay together but in either case could prove dangerous to ships possibly as far up as near South America and so we're talking about it's difficult people keep saying it's the size of Delaware it's the size of 20 New York's or something like that but no matter what how you quantify it it's huge and this is not something that happens inside of human history so the good news is that kind of very so no it's it's bad news overall but at least it was it's already in the water yes so if it was on land and broke off it would displace water and if sea levels would rise even more so it since it's already in the water that is not an issue yeah but they're worried that more one of the stats on yes so yes so Eric rigged NOAA NASA and University of california-irvine expert on our and arctica told The Washington Post that Larsen C currently holds back around one centimeter of global sea-level rise in the form of glaciers feeding into the remaining ice shelf so they were talking about what we wrecked Lee right now concerned about possibly going off and Genk is correct Antarctica is it's not just floating ice it's different than the Arctic you have portions that are already in the water and then you have portions of ice that are up on land but what's interesting there is that if those areas that are already in the water break off and then freeze the path for the ice that's on the land to also go and that's not just a lot of ice it's a lot more ice and so theoretically the larger fear is that the southward and poleward progression of ice shelf collapse could continue farther south their ice shelves that by stabilizing glaciers are currently preventing vastly more sea level rise than Larsen C does and depending on which scientist you talk to you there's a wide disagreement about how significant it would be if this continued to fall off but this is a part of some of the apocalyptic sea level rise predictions that we've seen in the past that this is one of the first phases of it so I blame Metallica I mean they played a concert there 2013 do they really raise awareness about you know global warming and climate change it couldn't do they rock me hard they rock that glacial glacial shelf and now it's roll rock and roll this is fine though this is fine this is fine so two more dangerous one is that like very like normal one and not related to climate change it's a giant freaking iceberg the size of Delaware so it's gonna go into some shipping lanes including the Drake Passage and so you know you have some possible Titanic like situations that's less likely in this modern age where we can see where they are better and hopefully they're not like the Clinton campaign and when somebody says icebergs dad they actually swerve but it cause some some issues around shipping Clinton campaigns iceberg other than like here Bernie take the wheel like yes no we said hey watch out the populist might have a chance of winning and they were like oh we don't have to campaign in Wisconsin or Michigan or anything like that we got this thing on lockdown what iceberg just want to make sure okay so the reason that I wanted to make sure that we cover this and thankfully there have been people have been tracking the expansion of the crack over time and it's been taking a while partly I wanted to get out before that thing falls off because it's gonna happen but also because I have a bit of a prediction I'm I I think that humanity is capable of great things I think that if we understand the significance of the threat that's facing us we do have the capability to stop it but we saw we we know that we have a big problem with guns in America and we had Sandy Hook and we decided as a country yes we will allow a bunch of kids to be gunned down that is not enough of a shock to get us to do something and we face I think a similar sort of shock here if an iceberg the size of Delaware can crack off of Antarctica and go floating off around the world and we do nothing then I don't know what it will take to shock us into action action necessary to save our civilization and so this is gonna be an interesting test for the world and again the scientists do disagree a little bit on how important this particular iceberg is and and what kind of consequence it allows they do not disagree on why it's breaking off it's not because it's getting colder it's because it's getting warmer and they agree that it is clearly man-made and so the final danger is when when these ice caps melts and the methane trapped inside the ice gets released you cannot put literally cannot put that genie back in that bottle and so when it goes into the a methane is much worse than carbon thereby making our situation on climate change far more dire yeah so it's one thing when they've go into the water you can't bring them back in and reattach it right go by the glue yeah and when they melt and the methane gets released we can't put it back in and that's when we're real real trouble yeah if you liked this video you'll love the
