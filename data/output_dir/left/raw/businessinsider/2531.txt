1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,970
- The fact that the OECD report

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,950
claims that this generation of
Americans for the first time

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,020
in the history of the United
States will be less educated

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,930
than the preceding generation
means that we do need to do

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,270
something quite aggressive
I believe in order

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,980
to get more voters to the ballot polls.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,000
The idea of weighted voting is essentially

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,870
providing a reward to
voters who are more engaged.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,912
One of the risks of this
proposal is that people

10
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:29,510
will interpret it very
superficially as rewarding,

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,500
or giving people who put more
education or more wealth,

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,250
a bigger weight in the voting process

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,240
and that is absolutely incorrect.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,030
The most important thing I believe

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,840
for democracy to function is two things.

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,020
One is to make sure that
as many people as possible

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,010
are voting, and so in that
context, one of the concerns

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,800
is low-voter participation rates.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,350
In the United States,
they are now around 50%.

20
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,140
For low-income households,
they are around 30%.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,040
But the second thing
that's critically important

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,628
is that voters have an understanding

23
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,310
of the political process.

24
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,920
One of the big issues
that has been revealed

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,810
is that we're seeing a lot of disaffection

26
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,960
and people tend to vote for
candidates based on things

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,450
as basic as what color
pantsuit they're wearing.

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,560
And that I think really
undermines the political process.

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Discussing what sorts of
factors would help us understand

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,390
who should be voting and
how voters should be voting,

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,350
I believe that having a
civics program where people

32
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,720
really understand how
the government functions

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,540
and who they're voting for and
what those people stand for.

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,070
At the very bare minimum, a
civics test, and I draw really

35
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,010
on my experience as an
immigrant, would really tap

36
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,868
into the historical context of
how exactly the United States

37
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:44,490
political system was established,
but more specifically,

38
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,040
it will talk about how
it's structured today.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,260
For example, just a basic understanding

40
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,710
of what the different
arms of government are

41
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,480
and how the political
process works from the role

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,370
of superdelegate and
delegate, but it's also about

43
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,570
how primaries work and
how the whole process of

44
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,640
the caucusing and the
electoral college works

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,060
in a democratic system.

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,812
And I think that, at a very
bare minimum, would help

47
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,600
voters understand what
the role of their vote is

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,900
and how that action would
impact, not just on the election

49
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,600
process, but also
long-term economic policy.

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,640
Because I'm an eternal
optimist, and because

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,240
we have a history where
people of color were not

52
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,890
allowed to vote, women
were not allowed to vote,

53
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,920
I imagine that there were
times when there was pause

54
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,040
and people thought, well we
really can't have a system

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,610
where women voted or
where minorities voted,

56
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,490
but here we are today in a
world where it is possible.

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,500
And so on that basis, I
don't see why we shouldn't

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,090
be optimistic about reforms and innovation

59
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,400
to the democratic process that can

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,630
make it stronger and perform better.

61
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,000
We want to make sure that
people do have access

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,480
to information about the
candidates that they're fielding

63
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,920
but also make sure that
they have understanding

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,910
about the basic political
and policy issues

65
00:02:58,910 --> 00:00:00,000
that are up for debate.
