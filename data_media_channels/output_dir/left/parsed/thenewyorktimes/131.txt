Justice Anthony Kennedy is
leaving the Supreme Court.
He’d been a key
vote in decisions
upholding abortion rights.
But President Trump
has said he
wants to appoint
a pro-life judge.
“Under my administration
we will always defend
the right to life."
Here’s what three
frontrunners have already
said about abortion, and the
landmark abortion rights case
Roe v. Wade.
Judge Amy Coney Barrett
has been championed
by Christian conservatives.
At a nomination hearing
for a federal appellate
court last year,
Democrats asked her how
her Catholic faith
may factor into her
decision making.
“You have a long
history of believing
that your religious
beliefs should prevail.
Well, how do you evaluate
the precedents — plural —
with respect to Roe?”
“The Supreme Court 
precedents?”
“Yes.”
“It’s not open to me, 
or up to me,
and I would have 
no interest in,
as a court of
appeals judge,
challenging that precedent.
It would bind.”
In a 2016 discussion,
she said she could
envision the scope
of abortion rights changing.
“I don’t think
the core case —
that Roe’s core holding
that, you know, women
have a right 
to an abortion —
I don’t think 
that would change.
But I think the question
of whether people
can get very
late-term abortions,
you know, how many restrictions
can be put on clinics,
I think that would change.
Next is Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
Before he became a
federal appellate court judge,
he helped the
Bush administration fill
the federal courts with
conservative judges.
But he skirted the
issue of where they
stood on 
reproductive rights.
“The abortion issue
was put forward
by the Bush administration,
as the sole litmus test.
Let me ask you this:
Could you identify
five pro-choice judges —”
“I —”
“that the White House
sent to the Hill?”
“I don’t know
whether the nominees
are pro-choice or
pro-life unless —”
“Four, three, two, one?”
“Senator, I’m sure 
there are many.
I don’t know what someone’s who –
I don’t know and we don't ask
what someone’s 
position on issues
like that is.”
And finally, there’s
Judge Raymond Kethledge.
He hasn’t talked publicly
about Roe v. Wade.,
but he has spoken about
the nature of
Supreme Court precedent.
“First and foremost, I’d follow
Supreme Court precedent.
The other thing I would
say is that, again,
I would make sure that
the values that I would
be enforcing if I were a
judge are not just my values,
that I am not striking
something down simply
because I don’t like it.”
President Trump said he will
announce a Supreme Court nominee
in the coming days.
