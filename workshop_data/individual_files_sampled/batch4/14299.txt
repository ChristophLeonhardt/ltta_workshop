there's there's a lot of ambiguity around general Flynn's but the quote-unquote misstatements I love the word you used I feel as well he was ambushed by the FBI in his office but clappers to me anyway is a little bit more clear-cut Ron Wyden asked about this is from Ben's piece in The Federalist quote clapper responded untruthfully to a question from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden about whether the NSA collected any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans whoa no sir end quote he James clapper asserted quote not willingly end quote clapper would then later admit in a written statement that his response was quote clearly erroneous end quote you've got the former Director of National Intelligence who admits in writing that he lied to a United States Senator under oath no ambiguity whatsoever Ben none general Flynn very ambiguous clapper walks general Flynn is prosecuted yeah you summarized it quite well and this brings us to the question of is there a double standard here and when you look at these two men on paper they kind of followed similar paths both rows to the top of the intelligence community both did so in the Obama administration now what happens after the Obama administration both did so after a military career clapper was an admiral was he correct both after long successful military careers but by all accounts general Flynn gets gets let go by the Obama administration why is he let go by the Obama administration well it seems pretty clear-cut that the reason is that the intelligence that he was producing the assessments that he was producing on what was happening in the Middle East in particular with respect to the growth of Isis the fact that al-qaeda quote-unquote was not on the run if they were on the run they were on the run to Syria to help in part build this Caliphate he predicted all that he predicted it in 2012 which conflicted with the narrative and those are Mike Flynn's own words by the way in a New York Times article later he said the administration and the intelligence community basically ignored the assessments that he was putting forth because it conflicted with an if they wanted to put forth which is that terrorism was under control there was not this massive metastasize ation of Sunni jihadism in the Middle East and Flint proved that there clearly was and he was very prescient I mean if you read the assessments that he put forth he basically predicted everything that happened in the Middle East that was no planet he was a brilliant brilliant man and universally regarded as a brilliant tactician and strategist but again he Obama loved his soundbites right and Obama branded Isis as the JV team and general Flynn's analyses directly contradicted that I mean they completely debunked statements of the president United States the Obama administration was not one that was open at critique and so Flynn was doomed I believe he was knew him the second he generated his first communicate to the Oval Office about Isis not in fact being the JV team yeah he said it wasn't the JV team he testified shortly after that comment about the JV team in Congress and essentially contradicted the the president's position and when you do that you're setting yourself up to be fired essentially and he was and so he was he was let go and then he does the thing that you can't do if you are a member in good standing of the national security and foreign policy establishment and that is you begin to yell and scream that the establishment has screwed up the entire world to in effect and you go and you serve as the right-hand man of Donald Trump who is viewed as the number-one enemy of the political establishment in general and in particular the national security and foreign policy folks and general Flynn goes on stage any chance lock her up to Secretary of X Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is symbolic of that establishment oh yeah you you've basically committed mortal sin he's committed career suicide is what you've done with the establishment yeah love bringing you these shows and these really important topics so please subscribe to our premium service at www.mediaed.org this
