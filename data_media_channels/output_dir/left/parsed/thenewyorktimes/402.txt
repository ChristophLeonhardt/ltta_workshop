This tractor is spreading corn
and birdseed as part of a
government-funded program.
It will feed tens of thousands
of cranes that would otherwise
destroy nearby crop fields
important for farmers.
The cranes are just a fraction
of the half billion birds that
stop off here, in the marshes and
swamps of the Hula Valley in Israel.
Twice a year, they fly thousands of
miles between Europe and Africa,
along the way threatened by
hunters in the Mediterranean.
This nature reserve is their
safe zone to rest and refuel.
And birders from around the world
gather each year to observe them
in the park and at festivals.
