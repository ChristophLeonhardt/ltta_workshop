1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,580
“We are rabid Americanists.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,930
So we believe that our industry
should remain in our country.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,530
We love our Harleys.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,120
We love the whole spirit
of the whole thing.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,640
It would break our hearts
to have to condescend

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,680
to an inferior motorcycle.”

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,770
This is Sturgis.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,560
It’s a motorcycle rally that
attracts half a million bikers

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,860
to South Dakota every year.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,080
“It’s like a pilgrimage
of misfits, blue collar,

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,490
evangelical bikers for
Christ and veterans.”

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,529
And while it’s not an exclusive
Harley-Davidson rally,

13
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:36,969
their presence is overwhelming.

14
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,629
“Harley-Davidson has attitude.”

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,040
“It’s the sound, the feel.”

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,220
“The rumble and the shake.”

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,470
“It’s in my blood.”

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,860
“If I have to explain,
you wouldn’t understand.”

19
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,210
“It’s American made. Or, was.”

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,510
And that’s what makes this year
a bit more political than usual.

21
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,071
“Harley-Davidson, please build
those beautiful motorcycles

22
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:59,311
in the U.S.A., please. O.K.?

23
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,411
Don’t get cute with us.
Don’t get cute.”

24
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:04,400
After Trump announced tariffs
on steel and aluminum,

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,620
the E.U. responded
with tariffs of its own,

26
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,500
targeting American motorcycles,

27
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,900
and Harley said it
would have to move

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,510
more of its production overseas.

29
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,630
That did not sit well
with some Harley owners.

30
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,860
“This is my last Harley-Davidson.

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,130
I’ll go to an Indian next time

32
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,650
unless they change
their mind and wise up.

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,250
We know that there are
parts on here that don’t

34
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,630
come from America cause
America don’t make them all.

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,820
But that’s not moving
the whole factory over.

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,590
We’ve been loyal to them,
and we just want loyalty back.”

37
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,900
This is the Fab 4.

38
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,650
Jawbone,

39
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,090
Bent,

40
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,460
Scrapper

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,580
and Stinger.

42
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,430
They founded the Dirty Old
Bastards Society five years ago,

43
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,870
and they own Stinger Saloon 
in downtown Sturgis.

44
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,730
For them, this recent move
by Harley crosses a line.

45
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,900
“The reason why people move
to foreign countries

46
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,930
is because they’re
greedy bastards.

47
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,910
I’m not saying that Harley’s
a greedy bastard,

48
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,190
but usually when people
leave this country

49
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,180
it’s because they want
to make more profit.

50
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,380
They don’t want to pay the
common man a fair wage.”

51
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,370
It’s not that Harley hasn’t
moved jobs abroad before.

52
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,750
They have factories in India,
Brazil, Australia and Thailand.

53
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,262
But Trump has put the company

54
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,162
at the center of
the political stage.

55
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:15,402
“Made in America!”

56
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,700
At the State of the Union,
Trump said Harley

57
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,460
was a victim of unfair
trade practices abroad.

58
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,370
“They weren’t even asking
for a change. But I am.”

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,220
And those politics have
trickled down to Sturgis.

60
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,400
“We want Harley-Davidson
to survive this storm,

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,380
but the person they've
got steering this ship

62
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,470
is way out of touch.”

63
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,800
Chris Cox is the founder
of Bikers for Trump.

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
He takes aim not at the brand,

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,610
but at the company’s C.E.O.,
Matt Levatich,

66
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,210
for moving things abroad.

67
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,139
“They’ve been planning
this for a long time

68
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,209
and for him to suggest
that it was because

69
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,439
of Donald Trump and
the tariffs is absurd.”

70
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,580
But some people feel
that this is what Harley

71
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,010
has to do to survive —

72
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,240
as long the bikes they buy
remain American-made.

73
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,340
“Well Harley owners
are feeling betrayed

74
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,050
because it’s ‘U.S.A., Harley!’

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,640
But if I owned Harley
I’d do the same thing.”

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,550
“If they’re going to go
abroad to save money,

77
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,400
hopefully they’re only
going to do that

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,860
for the motorcycles that
they’re going to sell abroad.

79
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,640
Hopefully us in America
are going to be able

80
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,740
to buy what’s made in America.

81
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,810
You know, but I support them.

82
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,780
I love their motorcycles.
I love their brand.

83
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,120
I couldn’t let them down.

84
00:03:30,120 --> 00:00:00,000
There’s no way.”
