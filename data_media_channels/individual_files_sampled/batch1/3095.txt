this is the Ferrari f12berlinetta it is not only the most expensive Ferrari still available for sale today it is the most powerful under the hood is a screamin v12 naturally aspirated engine it pumps out more than 700 horsepower and it's good for more than 500 pound feet of torque base price is three hundred fifteen thousand dollars most owners will spend another 50 grand on options the interior of this car is gorgeous there's high-grade leather everywhere there's carbon fibre all over the place but it's not actually that comfortable to sit in there's a reason behind it and that's because these seats will hold you in place when you're whipping around the corner this is the steering wheel unlike any I've ever seen you've got sport mode you've got wet mode you have a special feature for when the road is a little bump in you want to soften the suspension you've got track mode you've got traction control and you can turn traction control off from when you want to drift around a turn I'm not a race car driver but the first time I took it out I felt confident because it drives really smoothly it's not hard to handle the steering makes sense when you hit the pedal you're gonna feel the engine just throw you forward and if you have the bad luck to be sitting in the passenger seat you still get one incredibly cool feature and that's a small screen that tells you how fast the car is going so you know what the driver knows as soon as this car is not everything is perfect in a moment of weakness I decided to listen to the radio instead of the engine and had a lot of trouble it took me 5 to 6 minutes to get to the NPR station I was looking for but in a car like this you shouldn't be listening to NPR you should be listening to the engine it is going to take me a long time to get over this Ferrari driving down the street there's no other way to put it you feel like a boss
