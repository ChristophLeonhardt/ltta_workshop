I asked you about something that Senator Chuck Grassley said Senate Judiciary Chairman he said his committee wants to talk to Michael cones attorney Lenny Davis as a first step before deciding whether his committee will investigate Cohen's claims about Donald Trump do you want to see Michael Cohen back before your committees absolutely and good afternoon Nicole you know it is clear that Michael Cohen was not truthful with the House Intelligence Committee which is all the more reason that we never should have ended our investigation it now sounds like listening to mr. Davis that mr. Cohen does have information about what candidate Trump knew about the Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton in the meeting they set up at Trump Tower so yes bring Michael Cohen back bring them all back because none of them were really faced with tough questions or any subpoenas hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
