149

SHORT-TERM CHATTER OUT OF THE

150
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:01,947
WAY.

151
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:05,785
WE HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS THE

152
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,585
PROBABILITY OF A SEPTEMBER RATE

153
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:07,487
INCREASE.

154
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,523
THAT IS THE WHITE LINE.

155
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,827
WE ARE LOOKING AT 14%.

156
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,628
FOR DECEMBER, 30% RIGHT NOW.

157
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,531
WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

158
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,466
JANET YELLEN DOES NOT GIVE US

159
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,000
ANY INDICATION?

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,837
>> I THINK THAT IS FAIRLY

161
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,271
LIKELY.

162
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:25,705
IT DEPENDS.

163
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:30,276
IF SHE REALLY WANTS TO HIKE, SHE

164
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,544
WAS AN SIGNALS.

165
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,178
OTHERWISE, SHE WANT.

166
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,515
GIVEN WHERE MARKETS ARE AND THE

167
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,753
SENSE WE GET, DOES NOT SEEM LIKE

168
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:51,897
THEY ARE IN A BIG HURRY.

169
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:55,701
OLIVER: I THINK THE STORY OF THE

170
00:08:55,701 --> 00:09:00,940
WEEK WAS INFLATION.

171
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,909
ANY CHANCE THEY WILL BE

172
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,810
DISCUSSING WHERE AND HOW TO

173
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,780
TARGET INFLATION?

174
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,084
MATT: WHAT HE WROTE ABOUT

175
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:15,821
INFLATION TARGETING AND RAISING

176
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,622
THE INFLATION TARGET GETS TO THE

177
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,225
HEART OF THIS TOPIC AT JACKSON

178
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,059
HOLE, WHICH IS WE NEED TO THINK

179
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,627
ABOUT THINGS OTHER THAN WHAT WE

180
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,763
HAVE BEEN DOING AND WHAT WE ARE

181
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,266
DOING.

182
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,000
THE IDEAS HE PUT FORWARD,

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,670
POTENTIALLY RAISING THE

184
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,404
INFLATION TARGET, MOVE THE

185
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,607
NOMINAL GDP TARGETING, WE MAY

186
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,909
NOT GET MUCH ON THAT STUFF, BUT

187
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,013
THAT IS THE BACKGROUND FOR WHAT

188
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:41,881
THEY ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING.

189
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:47,219

00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,055
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

192
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,359
MATT: THIS IS RELATED TO

193
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,127
LONGFORM AND SHORT-TERM ISSUES.

194
00:09:55,127 --> 00:10:00,366
THREE-MONTH LIBOR IS RISING MORE

195
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,535
THAN ONE MONTH.

196
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,369
THE WHITE LINE IS THE COMPONENT

197
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:09,575
OF THAT INCREASE THAT IS ABOUT

198
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,142
FED EXPECTATIONS.

199
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,712
THAT HAS NOT REALLY MOVED MUCH.

200
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:18,150
THANKS ARE HAVING A HARDER TIME

201
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,951
FINDING DOLLAR FUNDING BECAUSE

202
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,422
OF REGULATORY REFORM AND OTHER

203
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,624
SOURCES OF DOLLAR FUNDING ARE

204
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:27,760
DRYING UP, LIKE PETRODOLLARS.

205
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,594
THIS GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT IS NOT

206
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,530
CONDUCIVE FOR BANKS GETTING

207
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,602
FUNDING, AND THAT IS KIND OF THE

208
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,571
PURPOSE OF A RATE HIKE, SO MAYBE

209
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,538
THAT PRECLUDES THE NEED FOR ONE.

210
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:45,644
MATT: I'M NOT GOING TO TRY AND

211
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,113
COMMENT ON THIS, BUT I WANT TO

212
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,782
TELL YOU WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT

213
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,516
THIS, PRICE EXPECTATIONS BY

214
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:50,883
GENDER.

215
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,553
MATT: THESE ARE INFLATION

216
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,555
EXPECTATIONS, IMPORTANT TO THE

217
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,025
FED.

218
00:10:59,025 --> 00:10:59,859
THIS IS WHAT KEEPS THEM UP AT

219
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,226
NIGHT.

220
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:04,730
FOR WOMEN, INFLATION

221
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,464
EXPECTATIONS ARE AT A RECORD

222
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,900
LOW.

223
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,734
FOR MEN, THEY ARE JUST SHY OF A

224
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:14,473
RECORD LOW, BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW

225
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,208
TENUOUS THE SITUATION IS.

226
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,244
THEY HAVE PLUNGED OVER THE LAST

227
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:18,978
FEW MONTHS, AND THAT IS AN

228
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:19,778
INTERESTING WAY TO LOOK AT IT.

229
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:24,550
JOE: I DON'T THINK I EVER

230
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,317
REALIZED BEFORE THAT THEY WERE

231
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,920
BROKEN DOWN BY THAT WAY, AGE,

232
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,687
GENDER, EDUCATION, AND PRETTY

233
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,690
MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD THEY ARE

234
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,361
FALLING TO NEAR RECORD LOWS.

235
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,128
THIS IS WHY THE FED IS BEING

236
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,863
VERY CAREFUL RIGHT NOW.

237
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,232
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WHERE THEY

238
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,000
WANT TO GET INTO HIKING RATES

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,667
AND HAVE THAT GO FURTHER.

240
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:46,372
SCARLET: THAT'S ONE OF THE

241
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,172
THINGS PEOPLE POINT TO WHEN THEY

242
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:47,907

STRONG AT SOME OF THE DATA

244
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,811
SUGGEST.

245
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,780
IF YOU LOOK AT GDP SINCE THE END

246
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,917
OF 2000 SEVEN, THE U.S. GREW

247
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:58,651
FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE

248
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,654
DEVELOPED MARKETS, BUT THE U.S.

249
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,888
POPULATION GREW FASTER, SO IT

250
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,557
GOES THE ECONOMY SHOULD GROW

251
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:09,462
FASTER.

252
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,296
WHAT MATTERS IS LOOKING AT PER

253
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,431
CAPITA GDP.

254
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,198

259
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,345
THE U.S. IS BLUE AND THAT

260
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,047

00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,822
THE SAME ISSUE NOW BEING SO

264

CLOSE TO ZERO AND HAVING TO COME

00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,743
THAT'S NOT A SITUATION WHERE YOU

275
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,477

00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:27,778
EVERYONE IS LOOKING AHEAD TO THE

566
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:29,914
JACKSON HOLE MEETING NEXT WEEK.

567
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:35,953
JOE: VERY LITTLE RIPPLES IN THE

568
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:36,687
MARKET, WHETHER IT IS FIXED

569
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:39,991
INCOME, FOREX, EQUITIES, ALL

570
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:40,458
VERY QUIET.

571
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,662
OLIVER: IT MAKES YOU WONDER

572
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,364
WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ARE

573
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,031
PREPARED FOR ANY KIND OF

574
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:47,465
DISRUPTION.

575
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,199
WE CHRONICLED A LOT OF THINGS

576
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:53,738
OUT THERE, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE

577
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:54,539
GOTTEN INTO THE MARKET, SO WE

578
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:54,939
WILL SEE.

579
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:55,706
JOE: IT'S ALMOST TOO QUIET.

580
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:56,774
OLIVER: MAYBE.

581
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:01,245
JOE: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

582
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,682
YOU CAN SEE CHANGES IN THE WORLD

583
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,516
ECONOMY BY OBSERVING HOW PEOPLE

584
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,250
TRAVEL.

585
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,687
THERE IS A SHIFT IT MAY HAVE A

586
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:10,488
POSITIVE OUTCOME FOR THE TRAVEL

587
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:15,759
INDUSTRY.

588
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,530
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

589
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,866
FROM YOUR PERCH, WHAT ARE YOU

590
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:22,633
SEEING IN THE WORLD AND WHAT

591
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,602
SHOULD PEOPLE WHO DON'T A

592
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,336
ATTENTION TO TRAVEL INDUSTRY

593
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,070
TRENDS CLOSELY BE WATCHING?

594
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,774
>> THE SUMMER IS GOING BADLY FOR

595
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,977
THE SECTOR BECAUSE OF FEARS,

596
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,280
ISIS, TERRORISM, ZIKA,

597
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,482
IMMIGRATION, ELECTIONS IN THE

598
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:44,889
U.S., AND GENERAL UNCERTAINTY.

599
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:45,723
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ISSUES IN

600
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:51,796
TERMS OF AIRLINES, I.T. ISSUES,

601
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:52,563
SOUTHWEST HAD AN ISSUE LAST

602
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,766
WEEK, DELTA AS WELL, SO A BUNCH

603
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:56,500
OF THINGS ARE AFFECTING THE

604
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,636
INDUSTRY AT THIS POINT.

605
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,839
WE THINK THAT TRAVEL IS THE

606
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,406
BELLWETHER SECTOR.

607
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:05,543
IT IS THE ONE THAT SNEEZES FIRST

608
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,310
WHEN ANYTHING HAPPENS IN THE

609
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,045
WORLD ECONOMY, SO AN INTERESTING

610
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:08,646
SECTOR TO LOOK AT.

611
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:12,617
SCARLET: I WANTED TO GET A

612
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,384
COMMENT I BROUGHT FROM THE CEO

613
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,819
OF KAYAK, TO THE EXTENT THAT

614
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,521
AMERICANS MIGHT BE TAKING

615
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:18,489
ADVANTAGE OF THE STRONGER

616
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:18,889
DOLLAR.

617
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:24,495
>> MOST AMERICANS DON'T THINK IN

618
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:31,935
TERMS OF EXCHANGE RATES.

619
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:34,371
IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD, BUT THAT

620
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,039
INTEREST WILL BE THERE.

621
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,975
SCARLET: MAYBE BY NEXT SUMMER.

622
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,710
IS THAT ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE

623
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,878
FEARS THAT ABOUND NOW?

624
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,815
>> PROBABLY NOT.

625
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:47,717
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF

626
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:50,987
DISTRACTIONS HAPPEN.

627
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:54,592
ZIKA IS TAKING OUT A HUGE AMOUNT

628
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,326
OF CAPACITY IN THE CRUISE

629
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:55,726
INDUSTRY.

630
00:34:55,726 --> 00:35:00,431
YES AND NO, THE ANSWER DEPENDS

631
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,132
ON THE TYPE OF DISRUPTION.

632
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:06,504
OLIVER: I WONDER IF SOME OF

633
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,305
THESE EVENTS HAVE KEPT PEOPLE AT

634
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,774
HOME INSTEAD OF TRAVELING.

635
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,608
I WONDER IF IT IS ALSO WHERE

636
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:17,714
THEY ARE HAPPENING.

637
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,217
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EVENTS IN

638
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:24,255
FRANCE, CAUTION BEFORE TRAVELING

639
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,991
TO MIAMI, ALL THESE PLACES YOU

640
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:27,825
DON'T TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH

641
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:28,392
FEARS ABOUT TRAVEL.

642
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:32,196
>> THESE THINGS ARE AT OUR

643
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,431
DOORSTEPS IN A LOT OF WAYS.

644
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,131
SOME OF THE ECONOMIES ARE

645
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,666
BENEFITING.

646
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,534
THE CAPACITY THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN

647
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:43,607
OUT OF TURKEY, TUNISIA, EGYPT,

648
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:44,408
THEY'RE GOING TO SPAIN AND

649
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:44,809
PORTUGAL.

650
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,444
JOE: WHAT ABOUT LOOKING AT IT

651
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,647
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

652
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,414
EMERGING CONSUMER AROUND THE

653
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,351
WORLD?

654
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,486
U.S. CONSUMERS ARE LESS INCLINED

655
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,721
TO GO TO EUROPE OR SOUTH

656
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,488
AMERICA, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A

657
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,725
HUGE BOOM OUTBOUND FROM CHINA.

658
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,625
WHAT ELSE ARE WE SEEING IN TERMS

659
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,328
OF COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS A

660
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,997
BIG BOOM?

661
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:12,570
>> CHINESE ECONOMY IS CHANGING,

662
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,639
BUT BRAZIL THIS YEAR HAS BEEN

663
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,708
PRETTY BAD FOR BRAZILIAN

664
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,910
OUTBOUND.

665
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,811
INDIA IS GROWING WELL.

666
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:24,115
IF YOU LOOK AT SOUTHEAST ASIA,

667
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,784
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST

668
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,551
FASCINATING AREAS IN THE WORLD

669
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:29,687
OF TRAVEL BECAUSE THE SHEER

670
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,454
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN

671
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:35,426
URBAN AREAS AND THE EFFECT OF

672
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:36,260
LOW-COST AIRLINES IN THAT REGION

673
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,429
OF THE WORLD.

674
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,263
WE THINK SOUTHEAST ASIA IS THE

675
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:39,864
BEST PLACE TO WATCH.

676
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:44,835
SCARLET: I WAS COMMENTING TO

677
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,438
SOMEONE BEFORE THE RECENT BOMB

678
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,172
ATTACKS IN THAILAND THAT IT

679
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:48,906
SEEMS LIKE THE SAFEST PLACE IN

680
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,009
THE WORLD TO VISIT NOW.

681
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,311
THE U.S. ALWAYS SEEMS ON EDGE

682
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,246
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A TARGET AND

683
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,046
THE SUMMER HAS BEEN AWFUL FOR

684
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:56,414
EUROPE.

685
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,015
IS THAT A MISCONCEPTION?

686
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,385
>> I THINK SOUTHEAST ASIA IS

687
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,789
SAFE.

688
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:06,891
THAILAND FROM A TOURISM

689
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,691
PERSPECTIVE, THEY HAVE THINGS

690
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:08,526
UNDER CONTROL FOR THE MOST PART.

691
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:13,164
THE ISSUE HAS BECOME THAT HOTELS

692
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,133
AND AIRPORTS GET HIT AS HIGH

693
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:20,371
PROFILE TARGETS.

694
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:25,543
JOE: WE HAVE TALKED OFF-LINE

695
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,445
ABOUT WHAT A GREAT COUNTRY

696
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,579
MALAYSIA IS AND HOW MORE PEOPLE

697
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,982
SHOULD TRAVEL THERE.

698
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:31,715
ARE YOU BULLISH ON THESE

699
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:32,183
COUNTRIES?

700
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,753
>> I THINK THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD

701
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,523
JOB WITH THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE.

702
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,193
THE KEY IS CAN AIRLINES DIRECT

703
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:42,960
ROUTES FROM SOME OF THE NORTH

704
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,627
AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN -- 

705
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:48,799
JOE: THE CRASH IS A VERY

706
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:49,600
AIRLINES, A TERRIBLE STRING OF

707
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,937
THEM, WAS THERE AN IMPACT ON

708
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,604
TRAVEL DATA AFTER THOSE?

709
00:37:53,604 --> 00:38:00,278
>> MALAYSIA HAD A HUGE

710
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,111
CONTINGENT OF CHINESE INBOUND,

711
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:01,912
AND THAT WAS AFFECTED BIG TIME.

712
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,615
OLIVER: AS PEOPLE RETHINK

713
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,584
TRAVELING, I SUSPECT THERE IS A

714
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,420
REACTION BY HOTELS AND AIRLINES

715
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,657
TO INDUCE PEOPLE.

716
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,758
IS NOW A GOOD TIME TO TRAVEL

717
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:15,459
WHEN YOU GAUGE EXPENSES?

718
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,696
>> JULY AND AUGUST, THE NUMBER

719
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,465
OF BOOKINGS WERE 20% UP AS A

720
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,400
RESULT OF A WEAKER POUND, SO IT

721
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,405
IS A GOOD TIME TO TRAVEL,

722
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,074
ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE, OUTSIDE

723
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:30,908
SOME OF THE FLASHPOINTS, IF YOU

724
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:31,242
WILL.

725
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,778
FRANCE IS STILL A SAFE PLACE IN

726
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,913
GENERAL COMPARED TO OTHER PARTS

727
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,149
OF THE WORLD.

728
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:38,916
PRICES ARE CHEAP, HOTELS ARE

729
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,919
CHEAP.

730
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,921
THE GOOD PART IS THERE IS A BIG

731
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,090
BATTLE BETWEEN THE ONLINE TRAVEL

732
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,492
BOOKING SITES LIKE KAYAK,

733
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,496
EXPEDIA, AND THE HOTELS, WHICH

734
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,398
MEANS THAT ONE IS TRYING TO

735
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,199
FIGHT THE OTHER AND PRICES ARE

736
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:55,566
LOWER.

737
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,935
OLIVER: PRICES ARE LOWER AS A

738
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:58,736
RESULT OF THE COMPETITION.

739
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:03,974
SCARLET: I WANT TO GO BACK TO

740
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,442
THAT CHART WITH CHINESE TOURISTS

741
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:06,243
SPENDING AND HOW OFF THE CHARTS

742
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,079
IT IS.

743
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,881
ONE THING I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT

744
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,683
WHENEVER THERE IS A GOLDEN WEEK

745
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,718
IN CHINA, CERTAIN CITIES AND

746
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:15,486
RESORTS ARE OVERRUN BY CHINESE

747
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,355
TOURIST.

748
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,723
YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

749
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:20,491
OF PEOPLE DESCENDING ON ONE

750
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,759
LITTLE CITY THAT MAY NOT BE

751
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:22,593
EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THAT KIND

752

OF VOLUME.

753
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,529
>> THE VOLUME OUT OF CHINA IS

754
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,497
OFF THE CHARTS.

755
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,299
EVEN INDIA.

JOE: IS THERE ANY CHANGE IN

757
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,372
WHERE THEY ARE GOING?

758
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:39,376
HAVE WE SEEN ANY TRENDS,

759
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:40,010
EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA?

760
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,381

764
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,925
I THINK THAT IS CHANGING,

765
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,027

THEY ARE GOING BE ON THE HUBS,

817
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,045
RUNNING A CAMPAIGN THAT IS

818
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:44,114
ESSENTIALLY A FOREIGN AGENT OR

819
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:44,915
HAS BEEN A FOREIGN AGENT FOR

820
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:45,682
PEOPLE SYMPATHETIC TO RUSSIA.

821
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:50,654
THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE HE WAS

822
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,321
SUPPOSED TO REGISTER AS A

823
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,991
FOREIGN AGENT AND DIDN'T.

824
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:54,725
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

825
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,361
DOMINATED THE CONVERSATION IN

826
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,929

827
00:44:58,929 --> 00:44:59,696
THAT IS NOT THE REBOOT THAT

00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,632

THE HEELS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

831
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,672
HAVING BROUGHT IN SOME NEW BLOOD

832
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:13,911
AT THE VERY TOP THAT SOME

833
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,046
INTERPRETED TO BE AT THE MOTION

834
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:16,647
FOR PAUL MANAFORT.

835
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,414
HOW MUCH OF THIS RESIGNATION IS

836
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,817
TIED TO THE FACT THAT THE

837
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:21,718
WRITING WAS ON THE WALL AND HE

838
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,419
WAS NO LONGER IN CHARGE?

839
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,756
HOW WAS THE BRINGING END OF THE

840
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:29,927
NEW BLOOD AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF

841
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:33,096
BAD NEWS TO PAUL MANAFORT,

842
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:33,931
UKRAINE TIES, WHAT WAS THE CAUSE

843
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:34,431
AND EVENT HERE?

844
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:39,603
>> I'M CERTAIN IT WAS THE NEWS

845
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,438
COMING OUT ABOUT UKRAINE THAT

846
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,172
WOULD BE THE CAUSE FOR THIS

847
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,941
RESIGNATION.

848
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:47,344
IT MADE IT A LOT EASIER THAT HE

849
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,111
BECAME LESS IMPORTANT FOR THE

850
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:48,745
CAMPAIGN AT THIS POINT.

851
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,080
HE WAS ALREADY BEING

852
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,848
DEEMPHASIZED EVEN THOUGH HE WAS

853
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:56,219
IN A CIRCLE AMONG THE TOP FOUR

854
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:57,287
PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN STILL.

855
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,056
WHEN YOU ARE HAVING THE

856
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,091
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TOP EIGHT

857
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,994
BEING A FOREIGN AGENT FOR PEOPLE

858
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,597
SYMPATHETIC TO VLADIMIR PUTIN,

859
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:09,433
IT IS NOT A HARD DECISION TO

860
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,133
ACCEPT HIS RESIGNATION.

861
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:13,203
SCARLET: SPEAKING OF AN INNER

862
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:20,577
CIRCLE, IT IS NOTABLE THAT 

863
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,378
IVANKA TRUMP AND HER HUSBAND

864
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,147
WERE ON VACATION AROUND THE TIME

865
00:46:24,147 --> 00:46:26,683
THESE CHANGES TOOK PLACE.

866
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:27,517
IS THERE ANYTHING TO READ INTO

867
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:27,884
THAT?

868
00:46:27,884 --> 00:46:31,621
>> I DON'T THINK I WOULD READ

869
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,324
MUCH INTO IT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

870
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:38,595
A HARD POLITICAL DECISION.

871
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:39,429
AGAIN, IT IS VERY EMBARRASSING

872
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,164
AND YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE A

873
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:42,132
DECISION THAT YOU ARE GOING TO

874
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,667
GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND

875
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,501
YOU'RE JUST KEEPING HIM AROUND

876
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,804
FOR SOME CONTINUITY.

877
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,604
IT IS NOT A HARD DECISION TO

878
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:47,971
MAKE.

879
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:53,143
OLIVER: I WANT TO BRING IN A

880
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,145
SOUNDBITE FROM A DONALD TRUMP'S

881
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,881
SPEECH, WHERE HE DID SOMETHING

882
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:58,682
THAT HE DOES NOT TYPICALLY DO,

883
00:46:58,682 --> 00:46:59,449
WHICH WAS SOME KIND OF APOLOGY.

884
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,385
>> SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF

885
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,320
DEBATE AND SPEAKING ON A

886
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,289
MULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DON'T

887
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:07,624
CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS OR YOU

888
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:12,529
SAY THE WRONG THING, I HAVE DONE

889
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,765
THAT, AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I

890
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:15,532
REGRET IT.

891
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:20,871
OLIVER: WHAT KIND OF APOLOGY IS

892
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,140
THIS?

893
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,974
IS THIS WHAT MY MOTHER CALLED

894
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:24,541
CROCODILE TEARS?

895
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,578
>> THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOWS

896
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:30,013
HE IS DOING WHAT A LOT OF

897
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,014
POLITICIANS DO.

898
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:31,848
YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY GET

899
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:36,420
EVERYTHING BACK I MAKING AN

900
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,254
APOLOGY, BUT IT HELPS SOME, AND

901
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:37,988
YOU HAVE TO MAKE APOLOGY

902
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,725
SOMETIMES EVEN IF YOU DO NOT

903
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,826
FULLY REGRET IT IN POLITICS, AND

904
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:47,264
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE TRUMP

905
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,065
THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS

906
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:48,899
DOING SOMETHING THEY DO IN THE

907
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:49,800
BIG LEAGUES IN POLITICS, WHICH

908
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,237
IS WHEN YOU OFFEND VOTERS, YOU

909
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,073
MAKE AN APOLOGY, EVEN IF IT WILL

910
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:56,840
NOT WIN THEM ALL BACK AND EVEN

911
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,908
IF YOU DO NOT ENTIRELY REGRET

912
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:58,475
WHAT YOU SAID.

913
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:05,015
JOE: THERE ARE IS THE HILLARY

914
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:07,217
CLINTON CAMPAIGN, THEIR OWN

915
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:07,951
CONTROVERSIES AROUND TIES TO

916
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:08,518
FOREIGN ENTITIES.

917
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:12,222
WE FOUND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION

918
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,056
WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT MONEY FROM

919
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,358
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.

920
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,192
WILL THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN

921
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:18,428
BE SUCCESSFUL OR ABLE TO MAKE

922
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,296
SOME HAY WITH CLINTON'S OWN

923
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,865
CONNECTIONS TO FOREIGN ENTITIES

924
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:22,699
NOW THE PAUL MANAFORT IS OUT OF

925
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,100
THE WAY?

926
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,036
>> ABSOLUTELY.

927
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:29,172
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME

928
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,007
HAY, EVEN WITH PAUL MANAFORT,

929
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:33,543
BUT IT HELPS THAT HE IS OUT.

930
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:34,377
THERE ARE FOREIGN ENTITIES WHO

931
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:36,146
HAVE DONATED TO THE CLINTON

932
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,581
INITIATIVE THAT HAVE BEEN

933
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,315
INVOLVED IN THE CLINTON

934
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:38,782
FOUNDATION.

935
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:43,086
IT IS NOT UNKNOWN IN POLITICS

936
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:43,887
FOR THE POT TO CALL THE KETTLE

937
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:49,459
BLACK, AND IT WASN'T AS IF

938
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:50,193
DONALD TRUMP WAS DIRECTLY

01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:55,611
THROUGH NOVEMBER 8 AND

1125
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,080
ULTIMATELY GET US THE VICTORY.

1126
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:57,914
MY FATHER JUST DID NOT WANT TO

1127
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,815
HAVE A DISTRACTION LOOMING OVER

1128
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:04,053
THE CAMPAIGN, AND QUITE FRANKLY

1129
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:04,854
LOOMING OVER THE ISSUES HILLARY

1130
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:05,421
IS FACING RIGHT NOW.

1131
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,858
JOSHUA: IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO

1132
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:09,625
SYMPATHIZES WITH WHAT MANAFORT

1133
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,393
IS GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW, IT

1134
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:14,931
IS COREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP'S

1135
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:15,731
FIRST CAMPAIGN MANAGER WHO WAS

1136
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:18,000
PUSHED OUT BY MANAFORT IN JUNE.

1137
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,136
LEWANDOWSKI WENT ON CNN TO TALK

1138
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,003
ABOUT THE NEWS THIS MORNING.

1139
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,139
HE DID NOT GLOAT AT ALL ABOUT

1140
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:23,806
THE MAN WHO OUSTED HIM.

1141
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,675
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU

1142
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:28,110
HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAD A VISION

1143
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:31,147
FOR THE CAMPAIGN WHICH DID NOT

1144
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:31,881
ALIGN WITH WHAT DONALD TRUMP

1145
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,449
WANTED.

1146
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,250
IT HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED

1147
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,452
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A ROBUST

1148
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,488
EFFORT IN STATES LIKE FLORIDA.

1149
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,523
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN LAID OUT YET.

1150
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:41,390
YOU CANNOT BLAME THE CANDIDATE

1151
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,526
FOR THOSE THINGS.

1152
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,327
THOSE THINGS FALL SQUARELY ON

1153
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:47,396
THE STAFF SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO

1154
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:50,633
BRING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES IN.

1155
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:51,434
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE CHANGES,

1156
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,135
PARTICULARLY IN A CAMPAIGN THAT

1157
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:55,304
HAS MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO GO

1158
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:58,307
AFTER HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE

1159
01:02:58,307 --> 01:02:59,075
FAILURES OF HER CAMPAIGN AND

1160
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,843
POINT OUT THOSE FAILURES.

1161
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:01,711
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE DONE A

1162
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:02,278
GOOD JOB ON THAT.

1163
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,413
JOSHUA: MAYBE YOU DID GLOAT A

1164
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,615
LITTLE BIT.

1165
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,382
WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM THE

1166
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:09,452
MANAFORT ERA AND WHAT COMES NEXT

1167
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:09,919
FOR TRUMP?

1168
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,755
MARGARET: THE FIRST THING WE

1169
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:13,556
LEARNED IS DONALD TRUMP IS HARD

1170
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:13,990
TO REIN IN.

1171
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,591
MANAFORT IS A PRO.

1172
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,494
HE KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS.

1173
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,663
HE TOLD TRUMP WHAT HE WANTED TO

1174
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:21,731
DO AND TRUMP BELIEVED IN HIM AT

1175
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:22,799
ONE POINT.

1176
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,534
BUT EVERY TIME HE TRIED TO

1177
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:27,537
MODULATE OR MODULATE --

1178
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:30,740
MODERATE, TRUMP WAS GUIDED BY

1179
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,374
HIS BETTER INSTINCTS.

1180
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,609
WE LEARNED THAT.

1181
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:34,410
ANOTHER THING WE LEARNED IS PAUL

1182
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,013
MANAFORT'S CONNECTIONS WITH

1183
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:37,847
PRO-RUSSIAN UKRAINIAN FORCES

1184
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,549
WERE DAMAGING TO TRUMP,

1185
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:41,384
PARTICULARLY IN COMBINATION WITH

1186
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,619
TRUMP'S MISCUES IN TERMS OF

1187
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:44,420
TURNING AGAINST THE GOLD STAR

1188
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,223
FAMILY.

1189
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,090
TRUMP IS NOW IN A POSITION WHERE

1190
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,492
THEY FELT THEY NEEDED -- HE FELT

1191
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,827
HE NEEDED TO DO THIS TO SALVAGE

1192
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:52,328
HIS PROSPECTS.

1193
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:56,799
JOSHUA: TRUMP IS ABLE TO FALL

1194
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:57,933
PREY TO THE SAME STAFF PROBLEMS

1195
01:03:57,933 --> 01:03:58,734
OF HILLARY CLINTON OR ANY OTHER

1196
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:01,804
TRADITIONAL CANDIDATE WOULD BE

1197
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:02,538
IF YOUR STAFFERS ARE DOING

1198
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:03,973
THINGS THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING

1199
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:04,774
A GET CAUGHT WITH THEIR HAND IN

1200
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:05,274
THE COOKIE JAR.

1201
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:08,878
THE SAME WAY MARK PENN DID WITH

1202
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,745
HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IN

1203
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,079
2008.

1204
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,914
MARGARET: DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO

1205
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:15,518
FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP.

1206
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,318
IN THIS CASE, HE DID NOT WANT

1207
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:17,086
THE FOCUS TO BECOME ABOUT PAUL

1208
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,488
MANAFORT.

1209
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,256
NOW THE QUESTION IS, IS THE

1210
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:20,990
FOCUS WANT TO STAY ON DONALD

1211
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:24,193
TRUMP IN THE WAY HIS NEW TEAM

1212
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:24,660
WANTS IT TO?

1213
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:28,464
JOSHUA: SO FAR, SO GOOD.

1214
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:29,265
HE HAS MANAGED TO MODERATE HIS

1215
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,099
IMAGE A LITTLE BIT WITH A SPEECH

1216
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,201
THAT SHOWED MAYBE THERE IS

1217
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,736
FINALLY GOING TO BE A PIVOT.

1218
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:37,373
MARGARET: IS ONLY 36 HOURS IN.

1219
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,175
LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND.

1220
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:43,813
LAST NIGHT IN NORTH CAROLINA,

1221
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:44,580
THEY TOOK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

1222
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,249
RAINS.

1223
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,651
DONALD DID SOMETHING WE HAVE

1224
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,285
NEVER SEEN HIM DO AS A

1225
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:49,952
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

1226
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:50,419
APOLOGIZE.

1227
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,288
IN A WAY ONLY TRUMP WOULD DO.

1228
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:55,257
DONALD TRUMP: SOMETIMES IN THE

1229
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:57,359
HEATED DEBATE AND SPEAKING ON A

1230
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,329
MULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DON'T

1231
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,365
CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS OR YOU

1232
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,501
SAY THE WRONG THING.

1233
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:06,435
I HAVE DONE THAT.

1234
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:09,271
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET

1235
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:10,606
IT.

1236
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:13,676
AND I DO REGRET IT.

1237
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,611
PARTICULARLY WHERE IT MAY HAVE

1238
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,381
CAUSED PERSONAL PAIN.

1239
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:22,351
TOO MUCH IS AT STAKE FOR US TO

1240
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:25,655
BE CONSUMED WITH THESE ISSUES.

1241
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:26,522
BUT ONE THING I CAN PROMISE YOU

1242
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:27,456
THIS.

1243
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:30,993
I WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU THE

1244
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:31,393
TRUTH.

1245
01:05:31,393 --> 01:05:33,462
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1246
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:36,365
MARGARET: THERE IS A WORD FOR

1247
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,467
THIS KIND OF THING THAT HAS BEEN

1248
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,035
USED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

1249
01:05:40,035 --> 01:05:43,739
AND AGAIN TO DESCRIBE THE TRUMP

1250
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:44,440
CAMPAIGN OVER THE PAST FEW

1251
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:44,840
MONTHS.

1252
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,241
PIVOTING.

1253
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:50,079
>> DONALD TRUMP APPEARS READY TO

1254
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,813
PIVOT TO A MORE PRESIDENTIAL

1255
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:51,213
DEMEANOR.

1256
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,817
>> IN THE MIDST OF THE PIVOT

1257
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:55,618
PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING AHEAD OF

1258
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,285
THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.

1259
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,286
>> MANY ARE CALLING THIS THE

1260
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,355
BEGINNING OF THE TRUMP PIVOT TO

1261
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:00,222
THE PRESIDENTIAL TRUMP.

1262
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:03,759
>> WE KEEP HAVING THIS

1263
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,728
DISCUSSION ONCE A WEEK IF NOT

1264
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:06,562
MORE OFTEN ABOUT HOW THIS IS THE

1265
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:07,997
TRUMP PIVOT.

1266
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:08,831
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE DAY HE

1267
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:09,465
FOCUSES ON SUBSTANCE.

1268
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,800
>> THIS IS THE 47TH TIME WE HAVE

1269
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,201
DONE IT.

1270
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:15,504
>> I WILL SAY WHAT I SAID LAST

1271
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,873
TIME AND SIX MONTH AGO WHICH IS

1272
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:18,707
HE IS FUNDAMENTALLY INCAPABLE OF

1273
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:19,709
DOING THAT.

1274
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:23,913
MARGARET: AND YET, TEAM TRUMP

1275
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:24,747
HAS AGAIN TRIED TO RESET THIS

1276
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:29,585
WEEK WITH MORE POLICY SPEECHES

1277
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:30,386
AND THE FIRST GENERAL ELECTION

1278
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:33,322
TV ADS WHICH TOUCHES ON

1279
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,190
IMMIGRATION AND HITS AIRWAVES IN

1280
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,825
FOUR STATES TODAY.

1281
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,562
LAST NIGHT AFTER TRUMP'S SPEECH,

1282
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:40,329
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN PUT OUT A

1283
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,130
STATEMENT THAT SAID IN PART --

1284
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:55,411
JOSH, TRUMP HAS BEEN PLAYING

1285
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,546
THIS PIVOT GAME BEFORE.

1286
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:58,380
HAVE WE SEEN ANYTHING TO SUGGEST

1287
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,181
THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT?

1288
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,083
JOSHUA: YOU NEVER KNOW.

1289
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,685
THIS COULD LAST 24 HOURS OR 48

1290
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,087
HOURS.

1291
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,122
IT COULD BE BACK TO SOME INSANE

1292
01:07:07,122 --> 01:07:07,923
TWEET THAT SINCE THE POLITICAL

1293
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:08,657
MEDIA SCRAMBLING.

1294
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:09,458
I THINK IT COULD BE DIFFERENT

1295
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,660
FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.

1296
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,394
HE HAS DECIDED HE IS NOT

1297
01:07:12,394 --> 01:07:13,229
COMFORTABLE WITH PAUL MANAFORT.

1298
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,098
HE HAS DECIDED MANAFORT'S

1299
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,400
RUSSIAN BUSINESS DEALINGS ARE

1300
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,703
HURTING HIM AND PUSHED HIM OUT.

1301
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,604
HE'S BROUGHT IN A NEW TEAM HE

1302
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:22,338
HAS KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.

1303
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,105
HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH THEM.

1304
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:26,409
IN SPEAKING TO SENIOR TRUMP

1305
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,511
OFFICIALS, THEY SAY TRUMP

1306
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,345
REALIZES HE IS BEHIND AND NEEDS

1307
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:32,181
TO MODERATE AND SOFTEN HIS

1308
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,383
IMAGE, WIN BACK SOME OF THE

1309
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:35,584
VOTERS HE HAS ALIENATED.

1310
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:36,452
THE ONLY WAY HE WILL DO THAT IS

1311
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:37,420
IF HE ACKNOWLEDGES I HAVE MADE

1312
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,487
MISTAKES.

1313
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,390
I THINK THAT IS WHAT LED TO THIS

1314
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,559
UNEXPECTED AND PRETTY REMARKABLE

1315
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,460
CONCESSION TRUMP MADE IN HIS

1316
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,296
SPEECH LAST NIGHT.

1317
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:50,533
MARGARET: ARE THEY TRYING TO

1318
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,267
GOAD HIM?

1319
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:55,738
JOSHUA: I THINK THEY ARE.

1320
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:56,605
HE SOUGHT AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT

1321
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,073
MANAFORT WAS LEAVING, HIS

1322
01:07:58,073 --> 01:08:00,342
CAMPAIGN MANAGER LITERALLY SAID

1323
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:04,413
THIS DOES NOT END THE STRANGE

1324
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,616
BROMANCE BETWEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN

1325
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:08,183
AND DONALD TRUMP.

1326
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:09,051
THEY DON'T WANT TO LET THE ISSUE

1327
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:11,520
GO.

1328
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,824
IT MAY NOT GO AWAY.

1329
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:15,691
AT LEAST HE HAS HELPED HIMSELF

1330
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,926
GETTING MANAFORT OUT OF THE FOLD

1331
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:20,029
AND STOPPING THE STORY THAT HURT

1332
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,296
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.

1333
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:23,465
MARGARET: THE MAIN QUESTION IS

1334
01:08:23,465 --> 01:08:26,801
HOW LONG IT WILL LAST.

1335
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:27,502
LET'S REASSESS.

1336
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:30,939
JOSHUA: SPEAKING OF PRESIDENTIAL

1337
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:31,707
THINGS, DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

1338
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:34,542
RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE TODAY

1339
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:35,377
FLEW TO BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA,

1340
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:39,715
TO TOUR IMAGE -- AREAS DAMAGED

1341
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:40,416
BY RECENT HEAVY FLOODING.

1342
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:44,987
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEES MET WITH

1343
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:45,787
FIRST RESPONDERS AND VOLUNTEERS

1344
01:08:45,787 --> 01:08:46,455
AT A BAPTIST CHURCH THIS

1345
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:46,822
MORNING.

1346
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:47,589
THERE HE IS UNLOADING A TRUCK OF

1347
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:48,756
SUPPLIES IN HIS LASER.

1348
01:08:48,756 --> 01:08:51,527
THE CAMPAIGN WAS CLEAR OF THIS

1349
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,962
TRIP WAS DESIGNED TO DRAW A

1350
01:08:54,962 --> 01:08:55,698
CONTRAST WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA

1351
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:56,765
WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY SOME

1352
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:57,700
FOR NOT INTERRUPTING HIS

1353
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,768
MARTHA'S VINEYARD VACATION TO

1354
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:00,502
VISIT THE DISASTER REGION.

1355
01:09:00,502 --> 01:09:03,538
WE SHOULD NOTE THAT THE

1356
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:04,540
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA

1357
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:09,278
HAS SAID HE PREFERRED THE

1358
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,112
PRESIDENT HOLD OFF SO IT DOES

1359
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:12,247
NOT INTERRUPT RECOVERY EFFORTS.

1360
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:13,115
THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED TODAY

1361
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:16,185
OBAMA WILL GO ON TUESDAY.

1362
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:16,952
THESE TYPES OF VISITS AFTER

1363
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:22,157
NATURAL DISASTERS ARE PART OF

1364
01:09:22,157 --> 01:09:22,890
THE GEEKS FOR PRESIDENTS AND

1365
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:23,524
PRESIDENT OF CANDIDATE.

1366
01:09:23,524 --> 01:09:24,158
HOW DID TRUMP DO TODAY?

1367
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:28,096
MARGARET: HE DID NOT BLOW IT.

1368
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:30,198
HE IS DOWN THERE TRYING.

1369
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:32,033
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS.

1370
01:09:32,033 --> 01:09:33,669
NUMBER ONE, JOHN BEL EDWARDS DID

1371
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,104
SAY INITIALLY IT WAS TOO SOON

1372
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:37,973
FOR OBAMA TO GO AND BY EXTENSION

1373
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:42,176
YOU CAN IMAGINE HIS PRIORITY

1374
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:43,011
NUMBER ONE WAS PROBABLY NOT TO

1375
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:43,812
HAVE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE

1376
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:46,582
STUMPING FOR VOTES.

1377
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:47,349
THE QUESTION FOR TRUMP IS

1378
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:48,317
TWOFOLD.

1379
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,651
NUMBER ONE, HOW DOES THE PUBLIC

1380
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:52,287
IN LOUISIANA RESPOND AND HOW

1381
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:53,589
DOES THE NATION SEE IT?

1382
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:54,390
DO THEY SEE IT AS HIM BEING

1383
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,659
CONCERNED OF THE PEOPLE OF

1384
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:57,559
LOUISIANA OR DO THEY SEE IT AS A

1385
01:09:57,559 --> 01:09:57,993
PHOTO OP?

1386
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:00,195
JOSHUA: I THOUGHT IT WAS

1387
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,731
INTERESTING.

1388
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:03,599
OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A PHOTO OP ON

1389
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:04,066
ONE LEVEL.

1390
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,801
I THOUGHT TRUMP SHOULD HAVE HAD

1391
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:10,038
A WORK SHIRT WITH A "MAKE

1392
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:13,342
AMERICA GREAT" LOGO SO YOU LOOK

1393
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,109
MORE COMFORTABLE PASSING FOOD

1394
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,579
OUT TO VICTIMS OF THE FLOOD.

1395
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,414
ON ANOTHER LEVEL, IT WAS

1396
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,349
INTERESTING THAT THEY PUT THIS

1397
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,583
TOGETHER BUT DID NOT LET

1398
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:22,217
REPORTERS COME ALONG.

1399
01:10:22,217 --> 01:10:22,918
THEY DID NOT LET TRUMP COME

1400
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,888
ALONG.

1401
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:26,688
I WAS REMINDED OF THE MOVIE

1402
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:30,793
"WHAT ABOUT BOB" WHERE BILL

1403
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:31,593
MURRAY WAS TALKING ABOUT DOING

1404
01:10:31,593 --> 01:10:32,227
THINGS IN BABY STEPS.

1405
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:32,995
THIS SEEMED LIKE A BABY STEP FOR

1406
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:35,864
ME FOR TRUMP AND GETTING OUT

1407
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:36,765
THERE A WAY FROM THE STADIUM

1408
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,367
RALLIES, AWAY FROM FOX NEWS, AND

1409
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:43,005
TRYING TO MASTER THE

1410
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:43,772
PERFORMATIVE ELEMENTS OF A

1411
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:44,707
PRESIDENT OF CANDIDATE.

1412
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,742
MARGARET: THE VISUALS.

1413
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:52,548
BUT NO ONE WITH A TAPE RECORDER

1414
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,315
TO ASK ME QUESTION HE COULD

1415
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:56,151
MISHANDLE ON TAPE.

1416
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:56,852
WHEN WE COME BACK, BOTH

1417
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:57,586
CANDIDATES ARE BETTING ON

1418
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,888
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

1419
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,024
WILL YOU BE AN ASSET OR A

1420
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:02,825
LIABILITY FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN

1421
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:03,258
NOVEMBER?

1422
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:05,194
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT AND MORE

1423
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:05,928
WHEN WE COME RIGHT BACK.

1424
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:06,795
♪

1425
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,475
MARGARET: LET'S CHECK IN ON

1426
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,377
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

1427
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,512
RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW

1428
01:13:37,512 --> 01:13:38,947
NEWS EVENTS, MOSTLY

1429
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:39,781
INTERNATIONAL, THAT THE WHITE

1430
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:40,515
HOUSE IS NOT THRILLED ABOUT.

1431
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:42,217
THE PICTURE OF A FIVE-YEAR-OLD

1432
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,052
PULLED FROM THE AIRSTRIKE RUBBLE

1433
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,120
REMINDED THE WORLD OF THE

1434
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,025
HORRORS IN SEVERE -- IN SYRIA.

1435
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:50,759
AND YESTERDAY, THE STATE

1436
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:51,526
DEPARTMENT ADMITTED THE CASH

1437
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:52,995
PAYMENT TO THE U.S. MAJOR IRAN

1438
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:55,431
WAS LINKED TO THE RELEASE OF

1439
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,432
AMERICAN HOSTAGES REIGNITING A

1440
01:13:57,432 --> 01:13:58,233
DEBATE OVER THE DEFINITION OF

1441
01:13:58,233 --> 01:13:59,535
THE WORD RANSOM.

1442
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:10,245
IT MAKES YOU WONDER WONDER HOW'S

1443
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:11,013
APPROVAL RATING IS DOING THESE

1444
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:11,380
DAYS.

1445
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,080
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS A HIGH

1446
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:12,614
APPROVAL RATING.

1447
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,315
>> HE IS LEAVING OFFICE WITH

1448
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:14,049
HIGHS IN THE APPROVAL RATING.

1449
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,984
MARGARET: THAT IS RIGHT.

1450
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:16,852
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S APPROVAL

1451
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:19,254
RATING HAS SOARED TO A STUNNING

1452
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,690
-- I GUESS IT IS ONLY 53%.

1453
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,725
THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE LATEST

1454
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,027
PEW POLL.

1455
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,995
HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN

1456
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,697
EMBRACING OBAMA ON THE CAMPAIGN

1457
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:32,000
TRAIL, AND DONALD TRUMP IS

1458
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,834
TAKING EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO TALK

1459
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:33,735
ABOUT THE OBAMA/CLINTON

1460
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,071
ADMINISTRATION DAYS.

1461
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:36,938
WILL THE PRESIDENT BE MORE OF AN

1462
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:37,739
ASSET OR A LIABILITY TO CLINTON

1463
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:38,373
IN THE COMING DAYS?

1464
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:42,310
JOSHUA: I DON'T THINK THERE'S

1465
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:43,111
ANY QUESTION BUT HE IS GOING TO

1466
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:43,812
BE A POSITIVE FOR CLINTON.

1467
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,014
I THINK ONE OF THE REMARKABLE

1468
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,383
STORIES ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, IF

1469
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:51,153
YOU WERE TO BACK UP 18 MONTHS,

1470
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:51,953
24 MONTHS, OBAMA'S APPROVAL

1471
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:54,590
RATINGS WERE IN THE 30'S.

1472
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:55,424
WHEN POLLSTERS ASKED PEOPLE IF

1473
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:56,191
YOU WANT THE NEXT PRESIDENT TO

1474
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:56,892
HAVE HIS VISION SIMILAR TO

1475
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,494
DIFFERENT THAN BARACK OBAMA, 75%

1476
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:02,331
SAID DIFFERENT.

1477
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,165
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO

1478
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:07,235
BE A MOST RUN -- MILLSTONE

1479
01:15:07,235 --> 01:15:08,036
AROUND THE NECK OF THE HILLARY

1480
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,238
CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

1481
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,909
53% IN THIS POLITICAL ERA IS THE

1482
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:18,313
NEW 80%.

1483
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:20,315
FOR A PAIR OF CANDIDATES WITH

1484
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:21,149
UPSIDE DOWN FAVORABILITY RATINGS

1485
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:24,252
STRUGGLED TO BREAK 45%, HAVING

1486
01:15:24,252 --> 01:15:25,687
53% IS A REAL PLUS.

1487
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,521
I THINK CLINTON HAS RECOGNIZED

MARGARET: COMPARED TO CLINTON

1491
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:33,628
HERSELF, HE'S DOING JUST FINE.

1492
01:15:33,628 --> 01:15:38,066
COMPARED TO GEORGE W. BUSH,

1493
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,367
NOWHERE CLOSE TO 53% IN THE

1494
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:41,303
WANING MONTHS OF HIS

1495
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:41,837
ADMINISTRATION.

1496
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:46,041
JOSHUA: AT THE DEMOCRATIC

1497
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:46,842
CONVENTION, THERE WAS SO MUCH OF

1498
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:47,609
A COMING TOGETHER.

1499
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,845
NOT JUST BARACK OBAMA'S SPEECH,

1500
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:50,746
BUT MICHELLE OBAMA'S SPEECH AND

1501
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:51,847
THE IDEA THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT.

1502
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:52,681
IN EIGHT YEARS, WE HAVE

1503
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,950
ACCOMPLISHED RATE THINGS.

1504
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,718
WE BROUGHT THE ECONOMY BACK.

1505
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:59,354
I THINK IT IS NATURAL, BARRING

1506

ABOUT HIM, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE

1511
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,798
CONTRAST IS THE RATIO HAVE

1512
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:13,135
BETWEEN THE TWO MOST UNPOPULAR

1513
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:13,902
MAJOR NOMINEES EVER TO RUN FOR

1514
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:14,402

1515
01:16:14,402 --> 01:16:17,406
MARGARET: AGREED.

1516
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,140
MORE OF AN ASSET THAN A

1517

CLINTON IS ELECTED PRESIDENT IN

1524
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:29,518
NOVEMBER.

1525
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:30,318
BILL CLINTON BROKE THE NEWS TO

1526
01:16:30,318 --> 01:16:31,086
FOUNDATION STAFF MEMBERS

1527
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,255
YESTERDAY, WHICH ALSO HAPPENED

1528
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,323
TO BE THE DAY AFTER DONALD TRUMP

1534

1535
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:48,470
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

1536

NEWS.

1673
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:13,988
THE MERCERS, ROBERT MERCER IN

1674
01:23:13,988 --> 01:23:17,125
2011 INVESTED $2 MILLION IN

1675
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:17,926
BREITBART NEWS WHEN IT WAS GOING

1676
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:20,628
THROUGH FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.

1677
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:21,462
AS FAR AS WE KNOW, HE STILL HAS

1678
01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:22,630
THAT STAKE.

1679
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:23,464
HE IS KIND OF IN BUSINESS WITH

1680
01:23:23,464 --> 01:23:23,865
BANNON.

1681
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:27,001
KELLYANNE CONWAY IS THE PERSON

1682
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:28,803
THE FAMILY TURNED TO, TO RUN THE

1683
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:32,941
SUPER PAC THEY WERE OPERATING

1684
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:33,975
EARLIER IN THE CAMPAIGN TO

1685
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:36,378
SUPPORT TED CRUZ'S RUN FOR THE

1686
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:38,213
PRESIDENCY.

1687
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:43,351
JOSHUA: EARLY ON, MERCER, BOTH

1688
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,786
MERCERS WERE ALL IN FOR TED

1689
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,621
CRUZ.

1690
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:47,388
THEY HAD SUPER PACS AND ALL

1691
01:23:47,388 --> 01:23:48,323
KINDS OF STUFF GOING ON.

1692
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:52,761
HAVE THEY PIVOTED SMOOTHLY TO

1693
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:53,595
TRUMP AND JUST SWITCHED HORSES

1694
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:54,028
MIDSTREAM?

1695
01:23:54,028 --> 01:23:57,632
>> IT SURE SEEMS THAT WAY.

1696
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:58,633
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THEY SEEM TO

1697
01:23:58,633 --> 01:23:59,467
HAVE WASHED THEIR HANDS OF TED

1698
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,636
CRUZ.

1699
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:02,337
AFTER TED CRUZ GAVE THE

1700
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:04,172
MEMORABLE SPEECH AT THE

1701
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:06,374
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WHERE HE

1702
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:09,377
DID NOT ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP,

1703
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:10,178
THEY PUT OUT WHAT I THINK WAS

1704
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:10,845
THEIR FIRST EVER PUBLIC

1705
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:11,813
STATEMENT.

1706
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:12,580
THEY DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE

1707
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,748
POLITICS.

1708
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:14,582
THEY PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING

1709
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:16,384
HE WAS WRONG, HE SHOULD HAVE

1710
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,320
ENDORSED THE CANDIDATE, WE HAVE

1711
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,856
GOT TO DEFEAT HILLARY CLINTON.

1712
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:22,690
IT WOULD BE VERY SURPRISING IF

1713
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,125
THEY EVER SEND ANOTHER DOLLAR

1714
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:27,095
TED CRUZ'S WAY.

1715
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:30,632
THIS IS THE FAMILY BIT AND

1716
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:31,266
CRAWLED THE SUPER PACS

1717
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:31,799
SUPPORTING HIM.

1718
01:24:31,799 --> 01:24:34,102
THEY SPENT $13.59 TRYING TO GET

1719
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,771
TED CRUZ ELECTED PRESIDENT SO IT

1720
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:37,972
WAS A STUNNING REVERSAL.

1721
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:38,673
THEY HAVE BECOME STRONG

1722
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:39,407
SUPPORTERS OF DONALD TRUMP.

1723
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:42,644
MARGARET: PROBABLY NOT GREAT

1724
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:43,611
NEWS FOR TED CRUZ.

1725
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:48,283
DO OTHER REPUBLICAN DONORS AND

1726
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:49,550
PEOPLE MAKE STUFF HAPPEN WATCH

1727
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:50,919
THE MERCERS?

1728
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:51,653
DO YOU THINK THEY WILL BE

1729
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:52,220
WATCHING THE MORE?

1730
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,757
>> TO SOME DEGREE, YES.

1731
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,259
ANYBODY WHO SPENDS AS MUCH TIME

1732
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:01,663
AND MONEY AS THE MERCERS DO, I

1733
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:02,430
THINK PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO

1734
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,265
THEM.

1735
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:05,099
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE

1736
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:05,867
BETWEEN THEM AND OTHER MEGA

1737
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,302
DONORS YOU MIGHT THINK OF LIKE

1738
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:10,271
THE KOCH BROTHERS OR PAUL

1739
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,973
SINGER.

1740
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:13,775
SOME DONORS TRY TO CREATE A

1741
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,810
NETWORK OF LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE TO

1742
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,445
DO PROJECTS TOGETHER AND RECRUIT

1743
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:19,414
OTHER DONORS TO FOLLOW THEM.

1744
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:25,386
THE MERCERS HAVE NOT CREATED A

1745
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:26,187
NETWORK OF DONORS BEHIND THEIR

1746
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:27,388
OPERATIONS.

1747
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:28,222
THEY ARE MUCH MORE DOING THEIR

1748
01:25:28,222 --> 01:25:28,690
OWN THINGS.

1749
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,926
JOSHUA: THE MERCERS HAD A SUPER

1750
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:35,063
PAC THAT SUPPORTED TED CRUZ.

1751
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:38,633
A FEW WEEKS AGO AFTER CRUZ LEFT

1752
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:41,536
THE RACE, THEY TURNED IT INTO

1753
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:44,172
THE "CROOKED HILLARY" PAC.

1754
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:45,573
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A TRUMP

1755
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:46,107
PAC.

1756
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:49,911
DOES THE FACT THE MERCERS HAVE

1757
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:50,712
THE SUPER PAC MEAN THEY CAN NO

1758
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:55,416
LONGER LEGALLY COMMUNICATE WITH

1759
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,184
STEVE BANNON AND PEOPLE AT THE

1760
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:56,884
TOP OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?

1761
01:25:56,884 --> 01:25:58,453
>> THE LAW IS A LITTLE UP IN THE

1762
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,221
AIR.

1763
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:02,357
ESSENTIALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE

1764
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:03,191
LAW IS TO TRY TO KEEP SOMEONE ON

1765
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,493
THE CAMPAIGN FROM PRIVATELY

1766
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:06,361
COMMUNICATING WHERE THEY NEED TO

1767
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,329
RUN ADS OR WHAT MESSAGE THEY ARE

1768
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,198
TRYING TO GET OUT TO A SUPER

1769
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:12,333
PAC, AND THEN HAVE THE SUPER PAC

1770
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,370
FOLLOW THOSE INSTRUCTIONS.

1771
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:16,838
ANYTHING THE CAMPAIGN MIGHT DO

1772
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,073
THAT IS PERCEIVED AS GIVING THE

1773
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,143
SUPER PAC INSIGHT INTO THEIR

1774
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:23,444
SECRET STRATEGY WOULD BE A

1775
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:28,383
POTENTIAL LEGAL PROBLEM.

1776
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,885
BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT, THERE ARE A

1777
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:31,719
LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO AS LONG

1778
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:32,553
AS YOU SWEAR UP AND DOWN YOUR

1779
01:26:32,553 --> 01:26:33,555
NOT TALKING ABOUT MESSAGING AND

1780
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,455
STRATEGY.

1781
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:37,091
JOSHUA: MERCER HAS BANKROLLED

1782
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:40,895
WHAT SEEMS LIKE A YEARS LONG

1783
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:41,763
EFFORT TO FIND AN ATTACK HILLARY

1784
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,898
CLINTON.

1785
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:44,599
HE DONATED MONEY TO THE

1786
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:45,366
NONPROFIT THAT PRODUCED THE

1787
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:48,903
"CLINTON CASH" BOOK.

1788
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:49,704
I BELIEVE HIS DAUGHTER WAS A

1789
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:51,539
BOARD MEMBER AT ONE POINT.

1790
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,841
IS THIS A VICTORY AND

1791
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:54,642
VINDICATION FOR MERCER AND HIS

1792
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:55,376
VIEW OF HOW POLITICS SHOULD BE

1793
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:55,777
CONDUCTED?

1794
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:59,313
>> MERCER HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- HE

1795
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:01,849
HAS NEVER BEEN A RIGHT DOWN THE

1796
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:02,951
MIDDLE REPUBLICAN DONOR.

1797
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:06,687
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN, FROM TALKING

1798
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:09,557
TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM, VERY

1799
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:11,559
MUCH OF THE VIEW THAT THE WHOLE

1800
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,628
WASHINGTON SYSTEM IS CORRUPT AND

1801
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:17,932
NEEDS TO BE UTTERLY REFORMED,

1802
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:20,068
BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT.

1803
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,104
AND SO, HILLARY CLINTON IS

1804
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:25,406
OBVIOUSLY PART OF THAT.

1805
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,240
BUT HE HAS ALSO FUNDED A LOT OF

1806
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29,010
STUFF TO GO AFTER JEB BUSH OR

1807
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,777

1808
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:34,249
JOSHUA: THANK YOU.

1853
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:15,436
BILL CLINTON'S BIRTHDAY.

1854

WERE WE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY?

1856
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:19,340
[LAUGHTER]

1857
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,609
MARGARET: WE WERE NOT INVITED.

1858
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,744
JOSHUA: I GUESS EVERYTHING IS

1859
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:24,445
SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE.

1860
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:27,648
DOES IT MATTER, WE HAVE DONALD

1861
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:28,416
TRUMP DOWN IN LOUISIANA TODAY,

1862
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:31,686
DOING PRESIDENTIAL THINGS, AND

1863
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:32,486
WE FOUND OUT THIS AFTERNOON THAT

1864
01:31:32,486 --> 01:31:33,487
OBAMA WILL BE THERE ON TUESDAY

1865
01:31:33,487 --> 01:31:34,455
DURING PRESIDENTIAL THINGS.

1866
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:36,757
DOES THAT PUT ANY PRESSURE ON

1867
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:37,591
HILLARY CLINTON TO MAKE A TRIP

1868
01:31:37,591 --> 01:31:39,860
TO BATON ROUGE, TO SHOW THAT SHE

1869
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:41,896
IS ALSO ON THE CASE?

1870
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:45,366
ANNE: SURE.

1871
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:46,534
IT SETS UP THE QUESTION, IF

1872
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:48,002
TRUMP GOES, WOULD SHE GO?

1873
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:54,575
I THINK SHE WOULD BE LEERY OF

1874
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:57,211
DOING SO, FOR FEAR OF LOOKING

1875
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:59,313
OPPORTUNISTIC.

1876
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:01,315
CERTAINLY THERE WAS CRITICISM OF

1877
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:02,149
TRUMP BY THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR

1878
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:05,052
FOR, AT LEAST THE POSSIBILITY

1879
01:32:05,052 --> 01:32:07,588
THAT HE COULD INTERFERE WITH

1880
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:11,659
EFFORTS THERE, OR MAKE, IN THE

1881
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:14,929
GOVERNOR'S WORDS, MAKE A PHOTO

1882
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:15,262
OP.

1883
01:32:15,262 --> 01:32:18,332
SHE WOULD BE LOATH TO DO THAT.

1884
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,100
BUT CERTAINLY IT RAISES THE

1885
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,634
QUESTION.

1886
01:32:20,634 --> 01:32:21,669
YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE

1887
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:24,038
UNITED STATES, AND THIS IS

1888
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,139
EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING THE

1889
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:27,842
PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO DO,

1890
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:28,642
EVEN IF IT MEANS INTERRUPTING

1891
01:32:28,642 --> 01:32:29,410
YOUR VACATION, SO WOULD SHE DO

1892
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:29,844
IT OR NOT?

1893
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:32,847
MARGARET: YOU KNOW, I AM STRUCK

1894
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:36,150
BY THE IDEA THAT, EVEN THOUGH

1895
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:38,018
TRUMP WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO

1896
01:32:38,018 --> 01:32:38,853
PUT THE HEAT ON HILLARY CLINTON,

1897
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:39,653
THIS ENTIRE LAST WEEK HAS BEEN

1898
01:32:39,653 --> 01:32:44,825
ALL ABOUT FOCUSING ON DONALD

1899
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:45,292
TRUMP.

1900
01:32:45,292 --> 01:32:46,060
HILLARY CLINTON AND JOE BIDEN

1901
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:46,794
WERE IN SCRANTON EARLIER THIS

1902
01:32:46,794 --> 01:32:47,461
WEEK, WHERE WE BOTH WERE.

1903
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:48,929
EVEN THEN, THE NEWS WAS

1904
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:51,232
OVERTAKEN BY TRUMP, BUT NEGATIVE

1905
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:51,832
NEWS ABOUT TRUMP.

1906
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:55,002
CLINTON KIND OF IS LOOKING AT,

1907
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:55,803
HOW MUCH DO I SIT BACK AND JUST

1908
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:56,971
LET HIM SELF-DESTRUCT?

1909
01:32:56,971 --> 01:33:02,877
ANNE: THAT HAS BEEN A LARGE PART

1910
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:03,677
OF THE CLINTON STRATEGY OVER THE

1911
01:33:03,677 --> 01:33:04,779
LAST 10 DAYS, TO JUST ORDER STAY

1912
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:05,312
OUT OF HIS WAY.

1913
01:33:05,312 --> 01:33:08,082
MARGARET: WITH BANNING AND KELLY

1914
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:12,787
-- BANNON AND KELLYANNE CONWAY,

1915
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:13,821
IS THIS GOOD NEWS FOR THEM, BAD

1916
01:33:13,821 --> 01:33:15,022
NEWS FOR THEM?

1917
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:15,589
ARE THEY WORRIED?

1918
01:33:15,589 --> 01:33:16,223
NOT THAT WORRIED?

1919
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:20,261
ANNE: I THINK THE DEPARTURE OF

1920
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,864
MANAFORT, FIRST SIDELINED, AND

1921
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:26,400
THEN GONE, THE INITIAL READ FROM

1922
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,134
INSIDE CLINTON WORLD ON THE

1923
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:31,339
SHAKEUP WAS, WELL, THAT'S

1924
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:33,307
CONFIRMATORY THAT THINGS ARE IN

1925
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:35,176
A GIANT MESS OVER THERE, SO THEY

1926
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:36,377
THOUGHT THAT WAS GOOD.

1927
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:39,079
THE DEPARTURE OF MANAFORT IS A

1928
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:41,415
BIT OF A WILDCARD, RIGHT?

1929
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:46,220
HE WAS A TEMPERING INFLUENCE, OR

1930
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:48,289
AT LEAST HE ATTEMPTED TO BE, AND

1931
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,123
THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

1932
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:50,825
EXPECT NOW.

1933
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:51,592
UNCERTAINTY IS NEVER A GOOD

1934
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:51,992
THING.

1935
01:33:51,992 --> 01:33:58,465
JOSHUA: A GUY LIKE BANNON IS SO

1936
01:33:58,465 --> 01:33:59,033
OUT OF LEFT FIELD.

1937
01:33:59,033 --> 01:34:01,535
HE HAS NO CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCE,

1938
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:02,236
AND ALL HIS INVOLVEMENT IN

1939
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:03,037
NATIONAL POLITICS HAS BEEN WITH

1940
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:06,607
BREITBART NEWS, JUST THESE

1941
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:07,408
OUTRAGEOUS ATTACKS THAT WOULD BE

1942
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:09,677
CONSIDERED WHEN OUTSIDE THE

1943
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:10,444
BOUNDS OF WHAT IS POLITICALLY

1944
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:11,178
ACCEPTABLE A FEW YEARS AGO.

1945
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:11,846
NOW I GUESS ANYTHING GOES.

1946
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:15,082
IS THERE A WAY WITH BANNON

1947
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:18,085
WHISPERING IN TRUMP'S EAR, THAT

1948
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:21,622
HE COULD ERUPT IN A WAY WE HAD

1949
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:22,389
NEVER SEEN BEFORE TOUR HILLARY

1950
01:34:22,389 --> 01:34:22,790
CLINTON?

1951
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:26,827
ANNE: THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

1952
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:27,661
I THINK THEY FELT THEY COULD

1953
01:34:27,661 --> 01:34:29,430
DRAW SOME BOX, AS LONG AS

1954
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,297
MANAFORT WAS IN THE PICTURE.

1955
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:31,999
HE WOULD NOT LET TRUMP TO X,

1956
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:35,402
WHATEVER X IS, AND THOSE LINES

1957
01:34:35,402 --> 01:34:36,537
ARE BASICALLY NOT THERE ANYMORE.

1958
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:39,139
MARGARET: SO IF YOU ARE THE

1959
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:40,574
CLINTON CAMPAIGN, AT LEAST WHAT

1960
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:43,410
YOU SAY IN THE PUBLIC

1961
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:46,080
POSTURE IS THAT THIS CHANGES

1962
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:46,881
NOTHING, WE ALWAYS EXPECTED A

1963
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:49,550
NASTY GUTTER CAMPAIGN, AND WE

1964
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:52,887
ARE PREPARED FOR IT.

1965
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:53,654
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE ACTUALLY

1966
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:54,455
BEHIND-THE-SCENES CHANGING THE

1967
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:55,155
GAME, STEPPING UP THE ATTACK

1968
01:34:55,155 --> 01:35:00,828
PLAN, OR DOES THIS GUARANTEE A

1969
01:35:00,828 --> 01:35:02,663
NASTIER RACE?

1970
01:35:02,663 --> 01:35:05,766
ANNE: THEY ARE NOT WRONG TO SAY

1971
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:07,802
FROM THE BEGINNING, THEY

1972
01:35:07,802 --> 01:35:10,404
EXPECTED THERE TO BE A BLOODBATH

1973
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:12,373
IN SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER, INTO

1974
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,208
NOVEMBER, THAT IT WOULD BE

1975
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:19,113
EXTREMELY NASTY.

1976
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:19,880
AND THEY WOULD BE READY FOR

1977
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,314
ANYTHING.

1978
01:35:20,314 --> 01:35:22,983
I MEAN, FROM MONICA LEWINSKY TO

1979
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:23,417
WHATEVER.

1980
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:26,620
HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS, IN THE

1981
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,589
PROCESS OF RUNNING FOR OFFICE,

1982
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:29,390
ALL THOSE THINGS WILL COME HER

1983
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:29,723
WAY.

1984
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:30,758
I THINK WHAT THEY DIDN'T PLAN

1985
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:35,763
FOR WAS THE SORT OF COMPLETE,

1986
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:38,432
UNPREDICTABILITY AND KIND OF,

1987
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:40,634
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEYOND THE

1988
01:35:40,634 --> 01:35:44,405
QUESTION OF HOW DO THEY RESPOND.

1989
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:47,108
IT'S A QUESTION OF, THEY HAVE

1990
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:47,908
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT THEY

1991
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:49,276
MIGHT BE HIT WITH ON ANY DAY,

1992
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:51,378
AND THAT THROWS PEOPLE OFF THEIR

1993
01:35:51,378 --> 01:35:54,081
FOOTING.

1994
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:54,915
I THINK THERE IS DEFINITELY NOW

1995
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:58,352
A SENSE, WITHIN A LOT OF THE

1996
01:35:58,352 --> 01:36:00,454
CLOSE CLINTON ADVISERS, THAT, I

1997
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:02,790
MEAN, IT'S JUST BUCKLE UP.

1998
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:05,392
THEY FIGURE IT'S GOING TO BE

1999
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:07,895
EXTRAORDINARILY NASTY, AND

2000
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:10,397
UNPLEASANT ON A DAY-TO-DAY

2001
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:10,865
BASIS.

2002
01:36:10,865 --> 01:36:14,869
AND THAT SHE IS READY FOR IT.

2003
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:18,505
I WILL SAY, I MEAN, SHE HAS

2004
01:36:18,505 --> 01:36:21,709
SHOWN THUS FAR A PRETTY SICK

2005
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:22,076
SKIN.

2006
01:36:22,076 --> 01:36:27,214
SHE HAS -- PRETTY THICK SKIN.

2007
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:28,015
SHE HAS NOT GOTTEN RATTLED OR

2008
01:36:28,015 --> 01:36:29,483
NASTY HERSELF IN PUBLIC, FOR

2009
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:33,654
MANY MONTHS NOW, AND IF SHE IS

2010
01:36:33,654 --> 01:36:36,323
ABLE TO KEEP THAT UP, I THINK,

2011
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:40,394
FROM THE CLINTON WORLD'S

2012
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:41,228
PERSPECTIVE, THEY WILL CALL THAT

2013
01:36:41,228 --> 01:36:46,233
A SUCCESS.

2014
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:49,236
SHE HAS HAD A LITTLE PRACTICE.

2015
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:49,703
[LAUGHTER]

2016
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:52,173
MARGARET: FAIR ENOUGH.

01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:53,107

2018

DOES THIS MAKE AMERICANS MORE

2185

SYMPATHETIC TO THE PLIGHT OF

2186
01:46:48,668 --> 01:46:52,572

2187

DOES THIS GIVE DONALD TRUMP

2190
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:57,644
ULTIMATELY THE SYRIAN REFUGEES

2191
01:46:57,644 --> 01:46:58,845
ARE SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP

2192
01:46:58,845 --> 01:46:59,279

01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:00,680
THE COUNTERPOINT, THOUGH, TO

2194
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,783
THAT, IS TO SOME DEGREE IT

2195
01:47:03,783 --> 01:47:04,584

2199

2207
01:47:22,969 --> 01:47:23,803
PULLS ON THE HEARTSTRINGS IN AN

2208
01:47:23,803 --> 01:47:24,771
OBVIOUS WAY.

2209
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:27,407

2210
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:30,477

2214
01:47:33,446 --> 01:47:36,816
IF YOU DO THAT, I THINK SHE CAN

2215
01:47:36,816 --> 01:47:37,651
REALLY KIND OF WIN THAT CENTER

2216
01:47:37,651 --> 01:47:38,318

MARGARET: A BIG FOREIGN POLICY

2221
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:47,527
CHALLENGE THIS WEEK FOR

2222
01:47:47,527 --> 01:47:48,328
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PERHAPS BY

2223
01:47:48,328 --> 01:47:49,095
EXTENSION HILLARY CLINTON, THIS

2224
01:47:49,095 --> 01:47:51,531
NEW REVELATION OF THE PLANE

2225
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:52,565
LEAVING GENEVA WITH $400 MILLION

2226
01:47:52,565 --> 01:47:54,768
ON IT, IT COULD NOT TAKE OFF OR

2227
01:47:54,768 --> 01:47:58,738
LAND UNTIL THE AMERICANS HAD

2228
01:47:58,738 --> 01:47:59,739
BEEN RELEASED FROM IRAN AS PART

2229
01:47:59,739 --> 01:48:01,241
OF THE DEAL.

2230
01:48:01,241 --> 01:48:02,075
REPUBLICANS ARE SEIZING ON THIS

2231
01:48:02,075 --> 01:48:04,978
TO CALL THIS EXCHANGE, THE WHOLE

2232
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:10,083
PROCESS, RANSOM, RANSOM PAYMENT.

2233
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:10,951
DOES THIS TAKE HOLD?

2234
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:14,354
DO MOST AMERICANS CARE?

2235
01:48:14,354 --> 01:48:15,188
OR HAVE A WRITTEN OFF THE IRAN

2236
01:48:15,188 --> 01:48:17,557
NUCLEAR DEAL AS SOMETHING TOO,

2237
01:48:17,557 --> 01:48:18,959
TO UNDERSTAND?

2238
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:21,027
TOM: IT CREATES SOME DAMAGE TO

2239
01:48:21,027 --> 01:48:24,097
HILLARY, BUT THE GREAT STRENGTH

2240
01:48:24,097 --> 01:48:26,466
HILLARY CLINTON FUNCTIONALLY HAS

2241
01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:27,167
IS THAT THE REPUBLICAN

2242
01:48:27,167 --> 01:48:28,802
ESTABLISHMENT ON FOREIGN POLICY,

2243
01:48:28,802 --> 01:48:29,602
AS MUCH AS THEY ARE THE PEOPLE

2244
01:48:29,602 --> 01:48:30,570
WHO HAVE COME OUT VISIBLY,

2245
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:31,905
BEHIND-THE-SCENES, THERE'S A

2246
01:48:31,905 --> 01:48:34,040
GREAT DEAL MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE

2247
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,076
FRANKLY MORE PREDISPOSED TO MRS.

2248
01:48:36,076 --> 01:48:37,844
CLINTON DAN DONALD TRUMP -- A

2249
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:44,284
VAN DONALD TRUMP -- THAN DONALD

2250
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:44,718
TRUMP.

2251
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:49,155
BECAUSE OF MR. TRUMP'S

2252
01:48:49,155 --> 01:48:49,923
PERSPECTIVE WEAKNESSES WITH

2253
01:48:49,923 --> 01:48:51,558
REPUBLICANS, HE LOSES

2254
01:48:51,558 --> 01:48:52,392
OPPORTUNITY TO USE THAT, WHEREAS

2255
01:48:52,392 --> 01:48:55,228
OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE

2256
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:55,662
POWERFUL.

2257
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:57,330
JOSHUA: ON THE TOPIC OF DONALD

2258
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:01,167
TRUMP'S POTENTIAL WEAKNESSES,

2259
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:02,001
THE OTHER BIG STORY TODAY IS THE

2260
01:49:02,001 --> 01:49:04,304
DEPARTURE OF PAUL MANAFORT.

2261
01:49:04,304 --> 01:49:04,971
AND WE KNOW FROM OUR OWN

2262
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:07,140
REPORTING INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN, A

2263
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:07,841
LOT OF THAT WAS DRIVEN BY

2264
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:11,244
MANAFORT'S INCREASINGLY

2265
01:49:11,244 --> 01:49:14,314
POLITICAL DANGEROUS TIES TO THE

2266
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:15,081
FORMER UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT.

2267
01:49:15,081 --> 01:49:18,284
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME, WHY THE

2268
01:49:18,284 --> 01:49:19,085
AP REVELATIONS THAT CAME OUT

2269
01:49:19,085 --> 01:49:22,322
YESTERDAY WERE SO SERIOUS ABOUT

2270
01:49:22,322 --> 01:49:23,289
PAUL MANAFORT, AND WHAT HE HAD

2271
01:49:23,289 --> 01:49:25,659
ACTUALLY DONE, LOBBYING-WISE IN

2272
01:49:25,659 --> 01:49:27,694
THE UNITED STATES?

2273
01:49:27,694 --> 01:49:30,797
TOM: FOR A COUPLE REASONS.

2274
01:49:30,797 --> 01:49:31,598
THE FIRST KEY REASON IS THE

2275
01:49:31,598 --> 01:49:33,800
CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN WHAT HE WAS

2276
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,434
DOING AND THE RUSSIAN

2277
01:49:34,434 --> 01:49:34,868
GOVERNMENT.

2278
01:49:34,868 --> 01:49:36,503
JOSHUA: TELL US WHAT THIS

2279
01:49:36,503 --> 01:49:36,936
REVEALED.

2280
01:49:36,936 --> 01:49:39,806
WHAT DID IT SHOW HE WAS DOING?

2281
01:49:39,806 --> 01:49:41,942
TOM: IT SHOWED HE WAS

2282
01:49:41,942 --> 01:49:44,511
ESSENTIALLY IN A VERY LUCRATIVE

2283
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:45,311
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE RUSSIAN

2284
01:49:45,311 --> 01:49:45,945
GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE

2285
01:49:45,945 --> 01:49:46,680
UKRAINIANS.

2286
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,748
IF YOU DELVE INTO THE DETAILS OF

2287
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:50,350
RUSSIAN ORGANIZED CRIME, THE

2288
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:53,286
SYNERGY WITH THE KREMLIN,

2289
01:49:53,286 --> 01:49:54,154
BASICALLY MORE WILL COME OUT,

2290
01:49:54,154 --> 01:49:55,388
AND THAT'S THE TAKEAWAY.

2291
01:49:55,388 --> 01:49:57,791
THEY KNEW THAT.

2292
01:49:57,791 --> 01:49:58,591
THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO GET AHEAD

2293
01:49:58,591 --> 01:49:58,925
OF IT.

2294
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:01,227
FRANKLY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW,

2295
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:03,530
IT SHOWS TO SOME AGREE -- DEGREE

2296
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:07,634
THE AMATEURNESS OF THE CAMPAIGN

2297
01:50:07,634 --> 01:50:08,902
THAT THEY DID NOT SHOW THIS

2298
01:50:08,902 --> 01:50:09,736
EARLIER.

2299
01:50:09,736 --> 01:50:12,572
JOSHUA: MANAFORT IS KNOWN TO BE

2300
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:15,508
AN OLD LOBBYING HAND, AND HE DID

2301
01:50:15,508 --> 01:50:17,143
NOT EVEN HAVE THE PROPER

2302
01:50:17,143 --> 01:50:17,977
REGISTRATION WITH THE FEDERAL

2303
01:50:17,977 --> 01:50:19,546
GOVERNMENT TO DO THIS.

2304
01:50:19,546 --> 01:50:21,047
WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE DONE?

2305
01:50:21,047 --> 01:50:21,881
TOM: HE SHOULD NOT HAVE JOINED

2306
01:50:21,881 --> 01:50:23,716
THE TRUNK CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE HE

2307
01:50:23,716 --> 01:50:24,484
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS WOULD

2308
01:50:24,484 --> 01:50:26,286
COME OUT.

2309
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:26,986
THIS IS STUFF THAT U.S.

2310
01:50:26,986 --> 01:50:27,620
INTELLIGENCE FOLLOWS.

2311
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:28,822
AT SOME POINT, THIS WOULD

2312
01:50:28,822 --> 01:50:30,757
PROBABLY HAVE LEAKED.

2313
01:50:30,757 --> 01:50:31,558
I WONDER WHAT THE FBI IS LOOKING

2314
01:50:31,558 --> 01:50:31,858
AT.

2315
01:50:31,858 --> 01:50:33,993
JOSHUA: THE FACT HE WAS NOT EVEN

2316
01:50:33,993 --> 01:50:34,928
REGISTERED.

2317
01:50:34,928 --> 01:50:36,629
TOM COBURN BECAUSE OF THAT, IT'S

2318
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:38,798
NOT JUST ABOUT -- TOM: BECAUSE

2319
01:50:38,798 --> 01:50:40,366
OF THAT, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

2320
01:50:40,366 --> 01:50:42,735
CORRUPT PRACTICES, BUT THE

2321
01:50:42,735 --> 01:50:43,570
SYNERGY WITH THE RUSSIAN

2322
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:45,839
GOVERNMENT, THE COLD WAR THAT

2323
01:50:45,839 --> 01:50:46,906
NEVER ENDED.

2324
01:50:46,906 --> 01:50:53,947
IT IS STUFF THAT, I DON'T KNOW

2325
01:50:53,947 --> 01:50:54,714
HOW SOMEBODY HAS BEEN IN THE

2326
01:50:54,714 --> 01:50:57,717
BUSINESS AS LONG AS HE HAS

2327
01:50:57,717 --> 01:50:58,551
THOUGHT HE COULD PLAY THIS ONE.

2328
01:50:58,551 --> 01:50:59,886
MARGARET: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

2329
01:50:59,886 --> 01:51:05,758
THE IDEA THAT TRUMP IS AN AGENT

2330
01:51:05,758 --> 01:51:06,459
OF THE RUSSIANS -- HAS HE

2331
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:07,026
DEMONSTRATED THAT?

2332
01:51:07,026 --> 01:51:10,029
LOSING MANAFORT, DOES THAT HELP

2333
01:51:10,029 --> 01:51:11,264
HIM TO SHAKE THAT PERCEPTION?

2334
01:51:11,264 --> 01:51:12,098
OR DOES HE HAVE KIND OF ANOTHER

2335
01:51:12,098 --> 01:51:14,100
HURDLE?

2336
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:18,037
TOM: THE BUSINESS LINKS THAT

2337
01:51:18,037 --> 01:51:19,105
QUITE FRANK WE HAVE NOT COME OUT

2338
01:51:19,105 --> 01:51:21,875
-- JOHN SCHINDLER, A FRIEND OF

2339
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:23,143
MINE WHO IS BY NO MEANS A

2340
01:51:23,143 --> 01:51:24,811
CLINTON SUPPORTER, WRITING AT

2341
01:51:24,811 --> 01:51:28,748
THE OBSERVER, A LOT OF STUFF

2342
01:51:28,748 --> 01:51:29,549
ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

2343
01:51:29,549 --> 01:51:30,884
CONCERNS ON THE U.S.

2344
01:51:30,884 --> 01:51:32,285
INTELLIGENCE SIDE.

2345
01:51:32,285 --> 01:51:35,221
TRUMP'S DIFFICULTY HERE IS THAT,

2346
01:51:35,221 --> 01:51:35,955
BECAUSE HE HAS SAID SO MANY

2347
01:51:35,955 --> 01:51:38,291
THINGS ABOUT PUTIN, BECAUSE THE

2348
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:39,025
RUSSIANS ARE CLEARLY ON HIS

2349
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:41,427
SIDE, AND IT'S VERY VISIBLE IT

2350
01:51:41,427 --> 01:51:46,099
IS AN ORCHESTRATED CAMPAIGN --

2351
01:51:46,099 --> 01:51:46,900
THE RUSSIAN EQUIVALENT OF THE

2352
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,635
NSA IS RUN UNDER PUTIN'S DIRECT

2353
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:49,469
OFFICE, SO THERE IS A DEGREE OF

2354
01:51:49,469 --> 01:51:50,336
CONTROL FROM THE TOP, IN TERMS

2355
01:51:50,336 --> 01:51:52,872
OF THESE HACKS THROUGH

2356
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:53,873
WIKILEAKS, WHICH IS THE

2357
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:56,075
RUSSIANS, THAT HE IS, THAT THEY

2358
01:51:56,075 --> 01:51:57,444
WANT HIM THERE.

2359
01:51:57,444 --> 01:51:59,446
FUNCTIONALLY, I THINK HE DOES

2360
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:04,550
LIKE PUTIN, AND THAT

2361
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:06,486
SELF-CONFIDENCE HE HAS, I DON'T

2362
01:52:06,486 --> 01:52:08,488
THINK HE WILL BACK AWAY FROM IT.

2363
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:12,825
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, WHAT WE

2364
01:52:12,825 --> 01:52:13,559
JUST TALKED ABOUT WITH THE

2365
01:52:13,559 --> 01:52:14,193
REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT

2366
01:52:14,193 --> 01:52:16,296
CONCERNED ABOUT RUSSIA, HE'S

2367
01:52:16,296 --> 01:52:18,364
DANCING IN A MINEFIELD HERE, AND

2368
01:52:18,364 --> 01:52:19,165
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FROM THE

2369
01:52:19,165 --> 01:52:20,266
SIDELINES, I THINK, ARE ENJOYING

2370
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:24,404
IT, BECAUSE IT WEAKENS HIM WITH

2371
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:25,138
CORE CONSTITUENCIES ON THE

2372
01:52:25,138 --> 01:52:26,372
CONSERVATIVE RIGHT THAT QUITE

2373
01:52:26,372 --> 01:52:27,307
FRANKLY DO NOT LIKE CLINTON.

2374
01:52:27,307 --> 01:52:29,375
MARGARET: IN TERMS OF THE

2375
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:30,510
WIKILEAKS, THE CONNECTIONS TO

2376
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:33,713
RUSSIA, GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW

2377
01:52:33,713 --> 01:52:35,315
MOST AMERICAN VOTERS, ESPECIALLY

2378
01:52:35,315 --> 01:52:37,750
VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE, KIND OF

2379
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:38,451
FEEL ABOUT WIKILEAKS IS A

2380
01:52:38,451 --> 01:52:40,787
PHENOMENON, AND HOW THAT MIGHT

2381
01:52:40,787 --> 01:52:41,621
SHAPE THEIR VOTING PROCLIVITIES?

2382
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:43,423
TOM: LOOK, WE TALK ABOUT IT

2383
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:46,326
PERHAPS MORE THAN PEOPLE ARE

2384
01:52:46,326 --> 01:52:49,562
CONCERNED ABOUT CORE ISSUES.

2385
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:50,430
THAT'S WHERE THE TRUMP AD WAS A

2386
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,799
GOOD AD, AT SMASHING PEOPLE OVER

2387
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:55,101
THE HEAD AND GENERATING CONCERN.

2388
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:55,969
THE PROBLEM HE HAS IS THAT BELOW

2389
01:52:55,969 --> 01:52:57,770
THE SURFACE, THE CONNECTION WITH

2390
01:52:57,770 --> 01:52:59,739
RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY,

2391
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:01,775
ULTIMATELY THE IDEALS OF THAT.

2392
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:05,778
VIRGINIA BEACH, ANOTHER EXAMPLE,

2393
01:53:05,778 --> 01:53:06,612
WITH MILITARY FAMILY SERVING THE

2394
01:53:06,612 --> 01:53:08,381
COUNTRY, THE IDEALS OF

2395
01:53:08,381 --> 01:53:08,848
DEMOCRACY.

2396
01:53:08,848 --> 01:53:11,751
THE ALEPPO BOY, WHERE THE

2397
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:12,452
RUSSIANS ARE VERY HEAVILY

2398
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:14,220
ENGAGED, DELIBERATELY KILLING

2399
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:14,954
PEOPLE TO BUILD PRESSURE,

2400
01:53:14,954 --> 01:53:15,421
DELIBERATELY.

2401
01:53:15,421 --> 01:53:17,557
WHEN PEOPLE START SEEING THAT,

2402

2405
01:53:21,527 --> 01:53:22,328

2406
01:53:22,328 --> 01:53:24,831
JOSHUA: TRUMP IS NOT THE ONLY

2407
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:26,833
ONE WITH CONCERNS WITH THE

2408
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:27,266
RUSSIANS.

2409
01:53:27,266 --> 01:53:28,902

2410
01:53:28,902 --> 01:53:30,470

01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:32,739
THESE LEAKED E-MAILS HAVE DONE

2412
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:35,708
POLITICALLY, CAUSING DEMOCRATIC

2413

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, HER POSITION

2415
01:53:39,879 --> 01:53:40,613
AND THE EXPECTATION IS A LOT

2416
01:53:40,613 --> 01:53:43,983
MORE IS TO COME, AND THAT THE

2417
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:44,684
RUSSIANS OR THE HACKERS OR

2418
01:53:44,684 --> 01:53:45,418
WHOEVER ARE HOLDING THEM UNTIL

2419
01:53:45,418 --> 01:53:47,653
AFTER LABOR DAY, IN THE FALL, AT

2420
01:53:47,653 --> 01:53:49,155
WHICH POINT THEY COULD REVEAL

2421
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:49,856
THINGS THAT ARE DEEPLY

2422
01:53:49,856 --> 01:53:51,557
INCONVENIENT, OR WORSE, FOR

2423
01:53:51,557 --> 01:53:52,125
HILLARY CLINTON.

2424
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:53,960
TOM: I THINK SO.

2425
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,661
I SUSPECT THEY DO HAVE STUFF IN

01:53:55,661 --> 01:53:57,163
THE SERVER.

2427
01:53:57,163 --> 01:53:57,864
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

2428
01:53:57,864 --> 01:53:59,799
SAFEGUARDS, AND BECAUSE OF HOW

2429
01:53:59,799 --> 01:54:02,135
AGGRESSIVE AND CAPABLE THE

2430
01:54:02,135 --> 01:54:03,636
RUSSIAN COLLECTION AGENCIES ARE,

2431
01:54:03,636 --> 01:54:05,104
THEY PROBABLY DO HAVE STUFF.

2432
01:54:05,104 --> 01:54:07,440
THE QUESTION IS HOW BAD IS IT,

2433
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,842
AND ALSO TRUMP, IF THE POLLING

2434
01:54:09,842 --> 01:54:11,911
GAP THAT HAS DEVELOPED IN THE

2435
01:54:11,911 --> 01:54:14,914
LAST COUPLE WEEKS SUSTAINS, I

2436
01:54:14,914 --> 01:54:15,648
WONDER WHETHER THE RUSSIANS

2437
01:54:15,648 --> 01:54:17,850
ACTUALLY, THEY MIGHT RETAIN IT,

2438
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:18,518
AND IF THEY REALLY HAVE

2439
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:19,285
SOMETHING, HOLD IT UNTIL AFTER

2440
01:54:19,285 --> 01:54:21,421
THE ELECTION.

2441
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:22,255
THE WHOLE POINT IS WE ARE DOING

2442
01:54:22,255 --> 01:54:23,856
A WORLD OF HYPOTHETICALS, BUT

2443
01:54:23,856 --> 01:54:26,492
THE RUSSIANS WANT TRUMP.

2444
01:54:26,492 --> 01:54:27,326
IF THEY THINK CAN HAVE UTILITY

2445
01:54:27,326 --> 01:54:28,127
TOWARD ELECTING TRUMP, THEY WILL

2446
01:54:28,127 --> 01:54:29,929
USE IT.

2447
01:54:29,929 --> 01:54:30,663
IF THEY THINK IT IS A LOST

2448
01:54:30,663 --> 01:54:32,131
CAUSE, IF THEY THINK IT IS A

2449
01:54:32,131 --> 01:54:33,132
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ TYPE STUFF OR

2450
01:54:33,132 --> 01:54:36,302
SOMETHING THAT EMBARRASSES

2451
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:37,804
CLINTON JUST FOR A COUPLE WEEKS,

2452
01:54:37,804 --> 01:54:39,305
THEY WON'T USE IT.

2453
01:54:39,305 --> 01:54:41,707
INTELLIGENCE BEHIND-THE-SCENES,

2454
01:54:41,707 --> 01:54:42,942
IN MORE THAN ANY OTHER ELECTION

2455
01:54:42,942 --> 01:54:46,479

2456
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:47,180
GREAT INTELLIGENCE GAME

2457
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:49,348
OPERATING IN THE BACKDROP, SO WE

SORT OF THING OFF?

2466
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:05,465
TOM: YES, I DO.

2467
01:55:05,465 --> 01:55:06,332
BECAUSE TRUMP WILL CONTINUE WHAT

2468
01:55:06,332 --> 01:55:08,000
HE'S DOING, AND WE HAVE SEEN

2469

02:02:52,431 --> 02:02:54,567
JOEL ROSENBLATT.

2585
02:02:54,567 --> 02:02:55,401
I WANT TO START WITH YOU, BRAD.

2586
02:02:55,401 --> 02:03:01,073
WHAT IS YOUR ANALYSIS OF LYFT,

2587
02:03:01,073 --> 02:03:01,807
TRYING AND FAILING TO SELL

2588
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:03,375
ITSELF, TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT

2589
02:03:03,375 --> 02:03:04,510
COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE

2590
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:06,479
ARCHRIVAL?

2591
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:08,814
BRAD: NOT A GREAT REPORT FOR

2592
02:03:08,814 --> 02:03:11,116
LYFT, BUT IT HAS BEEN A GREAT

2593
02:03:11,116 --> 02:03:12,485
MONTH FOR UBER.

2594
02:03:12,485 --> 02:03:14,687
THEY DID DEAL IN CHINA WITH

2595
02:03:14,687 --> 02:03:16,455
DIDI, AND THIS WEEK THEY

2596
02:03:16,455 --> 02:03:18,624
ANNOUNCED THE ROLLOUT OF THE

2597
02:03:18,624 --> 02:03:19,425
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PROGRAM IN

2598
02:03:19,425 --> 02:03:19,858
PITTSBURGH.

2599
02:03:19,858 --> 02:03:22,995
LYFT IS CHALLENGED.

2600
02:03:22,995 --> 02:03:23,862
THERE'S A LOT OF AMBIGUITY

2601
02:03:23,862 --> 02:03:24,797
AROUND ITS BUSINESS.

2602
02:03:24,797 --> 02:03:25,631
CAN IT BE A PROFITABLE NUMBER

2603
02:03:25,631 --> 02:03:26,565
TWO IN THE U.S.?

2604
02:03:26,565 --> 02:03:29,501
WHAT DOES THE MARKET LOOK LIKE

2605
02:03:29,501 --> 02:03:31,604
WHEN COMPANIES HAVE TO GET INTO

2606
02:03:31,604 --> 02:03:35,174
PROFITABILITY AND THEY CAN'T

2607
02:03:35,174 --> 02:03:35,874
KEEP SINKING MONEY INTO

2608
02:03:35,874 --> 02:03:36,308
DISCOUNTS?

2609
02:03:36,308 --> 02:03:38,711
WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND

2610
02:03:38,711 --> 02:03:39,912
THE REAL STRENGTH OF THE

2611
02:03:39,912 --> 02:03:40,779
BUSINESS, IT'S NOT SURPRISING

2612
02:03:40,779 --> 02:03:43,449
BUYERS WOULD BE HESITANT.

2613
02:03:43,449 --> 02:03:44,350
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY WILL NOT

2614
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:46,118
BE INTEREST FOR LYFT DOWN THE

2615
02:03:46,118 --> 02:03:46,952
ROAD, BUT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

2616
02:03:46,952 --> 02:03:47,386
QUESTIONS.

2617
02:03:47,386 --> 02:03:50,522
EMILY: LYFT DID HAVE A GLOBAL

2618
02:03:50,522 --> 02:03:53,425
ALLIANCE WITH DIDI IN OTHER

2619
02:03:53,425 --> 02:03:54,627
PLACES.

2620
02:03:54,627 --> 02:03:59,231
BRAD: IT'S A GREAT LEVEL OF

2621
02:03:59,231 --> 02:03:59,698
UNCERTAINTY.

2622
02:03:59,698 --> 02:04:09,674
THE CEO OF DIDI NOW SITS ON

2623
02:04:09,674 --> 02:04:10,476
UBER'SUBER'S BOARD.

2624
02:04:10,476 --> 02:04:11,176
SO LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT

2625
02:04:11,176 --> 02:04:11,944
WHETHER LYFT, IF THAT ALLIANCE

2626
02:04:11,944 --> 02:04:14,046
IS STILL IN PLAY AND IF IT WILL

2627
02:04:14,046 --> 02:04:14,680
IMPACT THE BUSINESS.

2628
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:16,048
EMILY: LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THE

2629
02:04:16,048 --> 02:04:16,448
LAWSUIT.

2630
02:04:16,448 --> 02:04:19,885
WE GOT THE NEWS YESTERDAY, BUT

2631
02:04:19,885 --> 02:04:20,619
WE ARE TRYING TO DIGEST WHAT

2632
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:21,220
THIS MEANS FOR UBER.

2633
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:23,722
A JUDGE, JOEL, HAS REJECTED A

2634
02:04:23,722 --> 02:04:24,723
$100 MILLION SETTLEMENT THAT

2635
02:04:24,723 --> 02:04:26,825
UBER STRUCK WITH DRIVERS OVER A

2636
02:04:26,825 --> 02:04:29,195
CLASS-ACTION SUIT IN CALIFORNIA.

2637
02:04:29,195 --> 02:04:29,995
HOW BIG OF A BLOW IS THIS TO

2638
02:04:29,995 --> 02:04:30,796
UBER?

2639
02:04:30,796 --> 02:04:33,499
JOEL: IT IS NOT A BLOW, BECAUSE

2640
02:04:33,499 --> 02:04:35,634
IN FACT, THERE'S SOME

2641
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:39,705
INDICATIONS TO ME THAT UBER WAS

2642
02:04:39,705 --> 02:04:41,073
AGITATING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

2643
02:04:41,073 --> 02:04:43,108
THE REASON IT IS NOT A BLOW IS

2644
02:04:43,108 --> 02:04:45,177
BECAUSE, AFTER THEY MADE THE

2645
02:04:45,177 --> 02:04:46,011
SETTLEMENT, THE NINTH CIRCUIT

2646
02:04:46,011 --> 02:04:48,514
AGREED TO HEAR UBER'S ARGUMENTS

2647
02:04:48,514 --> 02:04:50,883
THAT ITS ARBITRATION CLAUSE

2648
02:04:50,883 --> 02:04:52,584
SHOULD APPLY TO ITS DRIVERS, SO

2649
02:04:52,584 --> 02:04:55,554
NOW THEY CAN BET ON THIS RULING,

2650
02:04:55,554 --> 02:04:56,655
WHICH SEEMS TO BE FORTHCOMING,

2651
02:04:56,655 --> 02:05:00,092
IT'S NOT A SURE THING, BUT THEY

2652
02:05:00,092 --> 02:05:00,859
ARE BETTING THE NINTH CIRCUIT

2653
02:05:00,859 --> 02:05:01,560
WILL UPHOLD THE ARBITRATION

2654
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:03,062
CLAUSE, PUSHING ALL THESE

2655
02:05:03,062 --> 02:05:03,862
DRIVERS INTO PRIVATE ONE-ON-ONE

2656
02:05:03,862 --> 02:05:06,865
ARBITRATIONS AND DECIMATING THE

2657
02:05:06,865 --> 02:05:07,967
CLASS-ACTION.

2658
02:05:07,967 --> 02:05:09,935
LET ME ADD TO THAT.

2659
02:05:09,935 --> 02:05:11,637
THE BIG LEGAL STORY, AS I

2660
02:05:11,637 --> 02:05:16,208
UNDERSTAND IT, IS THIS PROBABLY

2661
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:17,076
DECADES-LONG TREND IN THE U.S.

2662
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:18,978
COURTS TO LIMIT THE RIGHTS OF

2663
02:05:18,978 --> 02:05:22,681
WORKERS TO ORGANIZE AND SUE

2664
02:05:22,681 --> 02:05:24,650
COMPANIES AS CLASS ACTIONS, AND

2665
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:28,153
WHAT COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING

2666
02:05:28,153 --> 02:05:29,188
IS ESTABLISHING ARBITRATION

2667
02:05:29,188 --> 02:05:30,823
CLAUSES WITH NOT ONLY EMPLOYEES,

2668
02:05:30,823 --> 02:05:33,158
BUT ALSO CUSTOMERS, AND SAYING

2669
02:05:33,158 --> 02:05:35,360
IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT, YOU

2670
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,128
HAVE TO TAKE IT UP WITH THE

2671
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:37,596
COMPANY IN PRIVATE ARBITRATION.

2672
02:05:37,596 --> 02:05:38,430
COURTS OVER AND OVER HAVE BEEN

2673
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:39,298
APPLAUDING THESE RULES, AND THE

2674
02:05:39,298 --> 02:05:40,999
REASON, MY SENSE IS THE REASON

2675
02:05:40,999 --> 02:05:45,571
THAT THE DRIVERS' ATTORNEYS

2676
02:05:45,571 --> 02:05:46,305
SETTLED WAS THAT THE NINTH

2677
02:05:46,305 --> 02:05:49,074
CIRCUIT HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO,

2678
02:05:49,074 --> 02:05:52,344
THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS,

2679
02:05:52,344 --> 02:05:53,112
WAS INDICATING THEY WERE GOING

2680
02:05:53,112 --> 02:05:53,846
TO BASICALLY DISSOLVE THE

2681
02:05:53,846 --> 02:05:55,514
CLASS-ACTION, IN WHICH CASE YOU

2682
02:05:55,514 --> 02:05:57,316
DON'T HAVE 400,000 DRIVERS, YOU

2683
02:05:57,316 --> 02:05:58,617
HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A THOUSAND

2684
02:05:58,617 --> 02:05:59,451
PEOPLE, DRIVERS SAVVY ENOUGH TO

2685
02:05:59,451 --> 02:06:02,054
OPT OUT AND NOT SIGN THE

2686
02:06:02,054 --> 02:06:03,389
ARBITRATION CLAUSE.

2687
02:06:03,389 --> 02:06:04,890
SO THE SETTLEMENT FALLS APART,

2688
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,326
BUT OVER, LIKE ALL COMPANIES --

2689
02:06:07,326 --> 02:06:09,027
UBER, LIKE ALL THE COMPANIES,

2690
02:06:09,027 --> 02:06:12,431
STILL HOLDS THE UPPER HAND,

2691
02:06:12,431 --> 02:06:13,298
BECAUSE IT'S AMBIGUOUS WHETHER

2692
02:06:13,298 --> 02:06:14,433
DRIVERS ARE EVEN ALLOWED TO SUE

2693
02:06:14,433 --> 02:06:15,701
THEM IN THIS WAY.

2694
02:06:15,701 --> 02:06:17,369
JOEL: I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

2695
02:06:17,369 --> 02:06:20,839
I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE

2696
02:06:20,839 --> 02:06:21,640
WRINKLE IN THIS CASE THAT POSES

2697
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:22,374
POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG THREAT

2698
02:06:22,374 --> 02:06:24,476
FOR UBER, WHICH IS THAT WHATEVER

2699
02:06:24,476 --> 02:06:26,211
THE NINTH CIRCUIT RULES DOESN'T

2700
02:06:26,211 --> 02:06:29,314
APPLY TO LAWSUITS IN STATE COURT

2701
02:06:29,314 --> 02:06:33,652
UNDER A SPECIAL LAW, UNIQUE TO

2702
02:06:33,652 --> 02:06:37,923
CALIFORNIA, IN WHICH THEY, THE

2703
02:06:37,923 --> 02:06:38,757
DRIVERS COULD BRING SUBSTANTIAL

2704
02:06:38,757 --> 02:06:40,425
PENALTIES, VERY BIG PENALTIES

2705
02:06:40,425 --> 02:06:41,727
UNDER LABOR LAWS.

2706
02:06:41,727 --> 02:06:44,563
SO, THE SPRING COURT, IF THEY

2707
02:06:44,563 --> 02:06:46,532
WERE TO TAKE THIS OUT, THAT

2708
02:06:46,532 --> 02:06:48,801
WOULD APPLY TO THESE DRIVERS,

2709
02:06:48,801 --> 02:06:49,535
BUT THE NINTH CIRCUIT RULING

2710
02:06:49,535 --> 02:06:54,139
DOES NOT DO THE JOB FOR UBER.

2711
02:06:54,139 --> 02:06:54,973
THIS SETTLEMENT FALLING APART

2712
02:06:54,973 --> 02:06:58,143
OPENS THE BOX, KIND OF RIPS THE

2713
02:06:58,143 --> 02:06:58,944
LID OFF OF A BUNCH OF LAWSUITS

2714
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:00,979
IN STATE COURTS, WHERE THE CASES

2715
02:07:00,979 --> 02:07:03,782
CAN GO FORWARD AND CAUSE A

2716
02:07:03,782 --> 02:07:04,183
PROBLEM.

2717
02:07:04,183 --> 02:07:05,951
EMILY: SO THE BEST CASE SCENARIO

2718
02:07:05,951 --> 02:07:06,919
FOR UBER, THIS MEANS DRIVERS

2719
02:07:06,919 --> 02:07:09,788
CANNOT SUE AS A CLASS ACTION,

2720
02:07:09,788 --> 02:07:10,522
AND WOULD HAVE TO SUE THEM

2721
02:07:10,522 --> 02:07:11,056
ONE-ON-ONE?

2722
02:07:11,056 --> 02:07:13,892
JOEL: WE ARE NOT THERE YET, BUT

2723
02:07:13,892 --> 02:07:14,760
THAT'S THE BEST CASE SCENARIO.

2724
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:17,863
EMILY: THE WORST CASE FOR UBER,

2725
02:07:17,863 --> 02:07:18,664
THE SETTLEMENT IS BILLIONS AND

2726
02:07:18,664 --> 02:07:20,232
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, BECAUSE THE

2727
02:07:20,232 --> 02:07:22,368
REASON THE JUDGE REJECTED THE

2728
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,202
LAWSUIT, HE SAID THE AMOUNT YOU

2729
02:07:23,202 --> 02:07:26,972
WOULD HAVE TO PAY IN REALITY

2730
02:07:26,972 --> 02:07:28,307
IS FAR GREATER THAN THIS.

2731
02:07:28,307 --> 02:07:29,208
JOEL: AND THEN THE APPEALS COURT

2732
02:07:29,208 --> 02:07:31,710
SOMEHOW DOES NOT OVERTURN THE

2733
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:35,080
DISTRICT COURT'S RULING THAT THE

2734
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:39,184
DRIVERS CAN'T BAND TOGETHER,

2735
02:07:39,184 --> 02:07:43,188
THEN YOU HAVE THESE -- CAN BAND

2736
02:07:43,188 --> 02:07:45,524
TOGETHER, AND THE NEW HAVE THIS

2737
02:07:45,524 --> 02:07:46,291
POTENTIAL MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR

2738
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:46,725
SETTLEMENT.

2739
02:07:46,725 --> 02:07:47,492
BUT HISTORY IS NOT ON THE SIDE

2740
02:07:47,492 --> 02:07:49,194
OF THE DRIVERS.

2741
02:07:49,194 --> 02:07:50,663
EVEN IN THE CASE OF FEDERAL

2742
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:51,530
EXPRESS, WHICH JOEL MIGHT HAVE A

2743
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:52,698
BETTER UNDERSTANDING, IT WENT

2744
02:07:52,698 --> 02:07:55,500
THROUGH THIS WITH ITS DRIVERS

2745
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:56,268
WHICH ARE ALSO CLASSIFIED AS

2746
02:07:56,268 --> 02:07:57,035
CONTRACTORS, AND THE PLAINTIFF

2747
02:07:57,035 --> 02:07:59,371
ATTORNEYS WON THAT CASE BUT

2748
02:07:59,371 --> 02:08:00,205
THERE WAS NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF

2749
02:08:00,205 --> 02:08:00,572
CHANGE.

2750
02:08:00,572 --> 02:08:03,408
THEY CHANGED A FEW THINGS.

2751
02:08:03,408 --> 02:08:04,076
FEDEX DRIVERS ARE STILL

2752
02:08:04,076 --> 02:08:04,610
CONTRACTORS.

2753
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:05,244
NOT MUCH CHANGED.

2754
02:08:05,244 --> 02:08:06,512
EMILY: THEY CERTAINLY DON'T GET

2755
02:08:06,512 --> 02:08:06,945
TIPS.

2756
02:08:06,945 --> 02:08:09,548
BRAD STONE, YOU WILL JOIN ME A

2757
02:08:09,548 --> 02:08:10,249
LITTLE LATER IN THE SHOW.

2758
02:08:10,249 --> 02:08:13,819
JOEL ROSENBLATT, OUR LEGAL

2759
02:08:13,819 --> 02:08:14,653
REPORTER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

2760
02:08:14,653 --> 02:08:15,454
BREAKING DOWN THIS VERY COMPLEX

2761
02:08:15,454 --> 02:08:15,787
STORY.

2762
02:08:15,787 --> 02:08:18,457
MORE ABOUT UBER, MAKING PLENTY

2763
02:08:18,457 --> 02:08:19,157
OF OTHER NEWS THIS WEEK.

2764
02:08:19,157 --> 02:08:23,095
ON THURSDAY IT LAUNCHED IT IS --

2765
02:08:23,095 --> 02:08:26,031
IT LAUNCHED AN AUTONOMOUS CAR

2766
02:08:26,031 --> 02:08:29,902
PILOT IN PITTSBURGH, BEATING OUT

2767
02:08:29,902 --> 02:08:30,669
THE AUTOMAKERS AND MAJOR TECH

2768
02:08:30,669 --> 02:08:31,436
PLAYERS LIKE GOOGLE AND APPLE.

2769
02:08:31,436 --> 02:08:32,237
WE WILL HEAR FROM ONE INVESTOR

2770
02:08:32,237 --> 02:08:35,507
WHO HAS HAD A LOT OF -- A LONG

2771
02:08:35,507 --> 02:08:36,174
RELATIONSHIP WITH UBER.

2772
02:08:36,174 --> 02:08:37,609
DAVID COHEN WAS PART OF UBER'S

2773
02:08:37,609 --> 02:08:42,481
ANGEL ROUND BEFORE THEY HAD A

2774
02:08:42,481 --> 02:08:43,549
SICKLE CAR ON THE ROAD.

2775
02:08:43,549 --> 02:08:45,717
CAROLINE: THE START OF

2776
02:08:45,717 --> 02:08:46,485
ACCELERATOR AND DEVELOPMENT

2777
02:08:46,485 --> 02:08:47,486
PROGRAM HAS BEEN HERE IN BERLIN

2778
02:08:47,486 --> 02:08:48,620
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW.

2779
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:52,624
DAVID:, THE FOUNDER C --

2780
02:08:52,624 --> 02:08:58,530
DAVIDO COHEN, THE FOUNDER,

2781
02:08:58,530 --> 02:08:59,298
WAS STOPPING TO THE CITY AND

2782
02:08:59,298 --> 02:09:00,332
TOLD US SOME WISE WORDS HE TELLS

2783
02:09:00,332 --> 02:09:01,566
TO ENTREPRENEURS IN GERMANY, AND

2784
02:09:01,566 --> 02:09:04,236
ALSO ABOUT A VERY SAVVY

2785
02:09:04,236 --> 02:09:08,974
INVESTMENT HE MADE YEARS AGO.

2786
02:09:08,974 --> 02:09:09,842
DAVID: I WAS TALKING TO THE

2787
02:09:09,842 --> 02:09:11,076
COMPANIES.

2788
02:09:11,076 --> 02:09:11,977
SEVERAL OF THEM WERE PRACTICING

2789
02:09:11,977 --> 02:09:12,778
THEIR PITCH, TALKING ABOUT WHAT

2790
02:09:12,778 --> 02:09:14,747
THEY DO, VERY GERMAN-SPECIFIC.

2791
02:09:14,747 --> 02:09:17,716
I TELL THEM, YOU ARE A PLAYER ON

2792
02:09:17,716 --> 02:09:19,051
THE WORLD STAGE, YOU KNOW.

2793
02:09:19,051 --> 02:09:20,886
THIS MAY BE WHERE YOU ARE

2794
02:09:20,886 --> 02:09:22,454
STARTING, BUT YOU NEED TO, FRAME

2795
02:09:22,454 --> 02:09:24,022
DIVISION AS A GLOBAL VISION.

2796
02:09:24,022 --> 02:09:26,091
WHAT YOU ARE DOING MATTERS.

2797
02:09:26,091 --> 02:09:26,925
YOU ARE NOT JUST COMPETING IN

2798
02:09:26,925 --> 02:09:28,961
ONE LOCAL MARKET, ONE LOCAL

2799
02:09:28,961 --> 02:09:29,895
LANGUAGE.

2800
02:09:29,895 --> 02:09:33,799
SO THEY WILL PROBABLY SAY, IT IS

2801
02:09:33,799 --> 02:09:37,803
WEBSITE DOT DE, BUT I SAY IT IS

2802
02:09:37,803 --> 02:09:38,771
JUST WEBSITE.

2803
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:40,872
IT'S A MENTALITY THAT YOU ARE IN

2804
02:09:40,872 --> 02:09:42,874
THE ENVIRONMENT IN GERMANY ALL

2805
02:09:42,874 --> 02:09:44,910
THE TIME, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU

2806
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:46,712
ARE THINKING ABOUT, BUT IN ORDER

2807
02:09:46,712 --> 02:09:49,047
TO BE TRULY COMPETITIVE, WE

2808
02:09:49,047 --> 02:09:49,748
TEACH THEM TO THINK MORE

2809
02:09:49,748 --> 02:09:50,148
GLOBALLY.

2810
02:09:50,148 --> 02:09:52,084
THAT'S ONE THING THAT I NOTICED.

2811
02:09:52,084 --> 02:09:52,851
CAROLINE: IS THAT RELEVANT

2812
02:09:52,851 --> 02:09:54,887
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES?

2813
02:09:54,887 --> 02:09:57,322
DAVID: THE U.S. IS A BIG MARKET,

2814
02:09:57,322 --> 02:09:58,357
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE, BY

2815
02:09:58,357 --> 02:10:02,828
COMPARISON, IT IS MORE REACH.

2816
02:10:02,828 --> 02:10:05,764
SO PEOPLE ASSUME, WHEN THEY HEAR

2817
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:07,966
A PITCH IN THE U.S., THAT IT IS

2818
02:10:07,966 --> 02:10:09,401
A GLOBAL COMPANY TO BEGIN WITH.

2819
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:10,202
WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE UBER

2820
02:10:10,202 --> 02:10:11,837
PITCH, WHERE I AM A SUPER EARLY

2821
02:10:11,837 --> 02:10:14,840
INVESTOR, IT WAS FOCUSED ON SAN

2822
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:17,242
FRANCISCO, BUT YOU KNEW THAT THE

2823
02:10:17,242 --> 02:10:18,076
ASPIRATION WAS ALWAYS GLOBAL.

2824
02:10:18,076 --> 02:10:19,478
IT IS SORT OF IN THE LANGUAGE,

2825
02:10:19,478 --> 02:10:21,747
AND YOU HEAR IT IN SUBTLE WAYS,

2826
02:10:21,747 --> 02:10:22,848
AND HERE IT IS THE OPPOSITE.

2827
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:24,883
MAYBE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TOO

2828
02:10:24,883 --> 02:10:26,752
MUCH MARKET FOCUS ON ONE

2829
02:10:26,752 --> 02:10:28,687
COUNTRY, ONE LANGUAGE, ONE

2830
02:10:28,687 --> 02:10:31,023
REGION, AND YOU TRY TO COACH

2831
02:10:31,023 --> 02:10:32,024
THAT OUT OF THEM.

2832
02:10:32,024 --> 02:10:34,993
CAROLINE: YOU SAY THE HOTTEST

2833
02:10:34,993 --> 02:10:35,727
DEAL IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST

2834
02:10:35,727 --> 02:10:36,528
DEAL.

2835
02:10:36,528 --> 02:10:37,229
IS UBER STILL A GREAT

2836
02:10:37,229 --> 02:10:39,164
INVESTMENT?

2837
02:10:39,164 --> 02:10:40,799
DAVID: IF YOU ARE INVESTING

2838
02:10:40,799 --> 02:10:44,102
TODAY, NO IDEA.

2839
02:10:44,102 --> 02:10:44,936
IF YOU WERE INVESTING WHEN I DID

2840
02:10:44,936 --> 02:10:45,737
IN THE ANGEL ROUND, GOOD DEAL.

2841
02:10:45,737 --> 02:10:47,739
YOU NEVER KNOW, BUT SO FAR, SO

2842
02:10:47,739 --> 02:10:49,408
GOOD.

2843
02:10:49,408 --> 02:10:50,208
IT WAS NOT A HOT DEAL WHEN I

2844
02:10:50,208 --> 02:10:52,110
INVESTED IN IT.

2845
02:10:52,110 --> 02:10:54,579
RYAN GRAVES, WHO I MET EARLY ON,

2846
02:10:54,579 --> 02:10:57,115
THE FIRST EMPLOYEE, WAS

2847
02:10:57,115 --> 02:11:03,121
MENTORING AT TECHSTARS AND THEY

2848
02:11:03,121 --> 02:11:03,889
DID NOT HAVE ANY CARS ON THE

2849
02:11:03,889 --> 02:11:07,225
ROAD, IT WAS JUST AN IDEA, BUT

2850
02:11:07,225 --> 02:11:08,026
YOU WERE EXCITED BY THE PEOPLE

2851
02:11:08,026 --> 02:11:09,828
AND THE VISION.

2852
02:11:09,828 --> 02:11:10,729
IT DIDN'T SEEM ANY BETTER THAN

2853
02:11:10,729 --> 02:11:11,596
ANY OF THE OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE

2854
02:11:11,596 --> 02:11:12,964
MADE THE DAY I MADE THEM, SO I

2855
02:11:12,964 --> 02:11:13,665
WAS JUST FORTUNATE TO BE

2856
02:11:13,665 --> 02:11:15,467
INVOLVED.

2857
02:11:15,467 --> 02:11:16,301
CAROLINE: WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW

2858
02:11:16,301 --> 02:11:17,269
UBER IS TRYING TO NAVIGATE THESE

2859
02:11:17,269 --> 02:11:19,037
MARKETS, THE REGULATORY

2860
02:11:19,037 --> 02:11:21,440
ENVIRONMENT, WHAT CAN EUROPE DO?

2861
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:22,307
IS EUROPE LISTENING?

2862
02:11:22,307 --> 02:11:24,243
IS THE REGULATION PLAYING BALL?

2863
02:11:24,243 --> 02:11:29,414
THEY ARE ALREADY IN BERLIN, AND

2864
02:11:29,414 --> 02:11:30,182
HAVING SOME PUSHBACK AGAINST

2865
02:11:30,182 --> 02:11:31,383
UBER, AGAINST AIRBNB.

2866
02:11:31,383 --> 02:11:32,918
DAVID: WHEN I CAME HERE, I ENDED

2867
02:11:32,918 --> 02:11:35,253
UP IN A TAXI, BUT IT WAS AN UBER

2868
02:11:35,253 --> 02:11:37,589
TAXI, SO AT LEAST THEY ARE ON

2869
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:38,090
THE PLATFORM.

2870
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:39,524
THEREFORE, IT'S A LITTLE MORE

2871
02:11:39,524 --> 02:11:40,325
CHALLENGING TO GET AROUND HERE.

2872
02:11:40,325 --> 02:11:45,530
I THINK, YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF

2873
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:46,298
THE CUSTOMS -- FOR US, COMING

2874
02:11:46,298 --> 02:11:49,134
HERE EVEN AS AN EXAMPLE, WE HAVE

2875
02:11:49,134 --> 02:11:51,169
SPENT MORE ON DEALING WITH THE

2876
02:11:51,169 --> 02:11:54,473
CUSTOMS OF THE LEGAL, RIGHT,

2877
02:11:54,473 --> 02:11:55,240
THEN WE HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE IN

2878
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:55,841
THE WORLD.

2879
02:11:55,841 --> 02:11:56,708
WE ARE IN A LOT OF PLACES IN THE

2880
02:11:56,708 --> 02:11:57,609
WORLD.

2881
02:11:57,609 --> 02:12:02,614
SO JUST THE PROCESSES IN PLACE.

2882
02:12:02,614 --> 02:12:05,717
I DON'T THINK IT'S INTENTIONAL.

2883
02:12:05,717 --> 02:12:06,485
IT IS JUST AN ARTIFACT OF HOW

2884
02:12:06,485 --> 02:12:07,219
THE SYSTEMS DEVELOPED, BUT IT

2885
02:12:07,219 --> 02:12:10,622
SURE FEELS SOME THINGS COULD BE

2886
02:12:10,622 --> 02:12:11,456
SIMPLE FIGHT TO SUPPORT BUSINESS

2887
02:12:11,456 --> 02:12:12,791
THAT WANTS TO BE HERE.

2888
02:12:12,791 --> 02:12:13,592
CAROLINE: DOES THAT TAKE THE

2889
02:12:13,592 --> 02:12:17,729
BUSINESSES, AS UBER IS, AS OTHER

2890
02:12:17,729 --> 02:12:21,399
LOCAL COMPANIES ARE, GOING OUT

2891
02:12:21,399 --> 02:12:22,734
AND SPEAKING AND LOBBYING?

2892
02:12:22,734 --> 02:12:23,568
DAVID: THAT ENDS UP HAPPENING.

2893
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,904
ONE OF THE REASONS IT OVER

2894
02:12:25,904 --> 02:12:26,738
RAISED SO MUCH MONEY IS TO BE

2895
02:12:26,738 --> 02:12:28,406
ABLE TO GO OUT AND CONVINCE

2896
02:12:28,406 --> 02:12:29,207
PEOPLE THAT THIS IS SAFER, THIS

2897
02:12:29,207 --> 02:12:31,843
IS BETTER, AND ANYONE WHO HAS

2898
02:12:31,843 --> 02:12:33,679
USED THE SERVICE KNOWS IT IS.

2899
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:36,481
HERE AND IN THE U K, YOU HAVE A

2900
02:12:36,481 --> 02:12:37,315
VERY GOOD TAXI SYSTEM ALREADY,

2901
02:12:37,315 --> 02:12:38,784
SO IT SORT OF WORKS.

2902
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,318
IT'S JUST HARD TO MANAGE AS AN

2903
02:12:40,318 --> 02:12:41,720
AND USER.

2904
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,622
YOU END UP CALLING AROUND.

2905
02:12:43,622 --> 02:12:44,456
SO IT'S A GREAT INNOVATION TO

2906
02:12:44,456 --> 02:12:45,757
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT ON

2907
02:12:45,757 --> 02:12:46,925
DEMAND LIKE THAT.

2908
02:12:46,925 --> 02:12:50,495
BUT I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO

2909
02:12:50,495 --> 02:12:51,296
SEE A LOT OF MONEY POURED INTO

2910
02:12:51,296 --> 02:12:54,199
CONVINCING THE WORLD THIS IS A

2911
02:12:54,199 --> 02:12:55,667
GOOD THING.

2912
02:12:55,667 --> 02:12:56,468
CAROLINE: SHOULD GO PUBLIC THIS

2913
02:12:56,468 --> 02:12:56,969
YEAR?

2914
02:12:56,969 --> 02:12:57,736
DAVID: I DOUBT IT WILL.

2915
02:12:57,736 --> 02:13:00,705
WHO AM I TO SAY WHAT IT SHOULD

2916
02:13:00,705 --> 02:13:01,039
DO?

2917
02:13:01,039 --> 02:13:04,076
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME

2918
02:13:04,076 --> 02:13:04,910
LIQUIDITY FROM GETTING SO LUCKY

2919
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:06,978
WITH THE EARLY INVESTMENT.

2920
02:13:06,978 --> 02:13:07,812
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL

2921
02:13:07,812 --> 02:13:08,213
THAT WAY.

2922
02:13:08,213 --> 02:13:09,080
IT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL COMPANY

2923
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:10,882
NOW, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL IT

2924
02:13:10,882 --> 02:13:12,617
STILL HAS UPSIDE, AND OBVIOUSLY

2925
02:13:12,617 --> 02:13:15,987
A LOT OF MONEY IS BEING

2926
02:13:15,987 --> 02:13:18,223
POURED INTO IT.

2927
02:13:18,223 --> 02:13:19,057
CAROLINE: WHAT WAS ONE COMPANY

2928
02:13:19,057 --> 02:13:21,893
YOU WISH YOU HAD HAD AS A

2929
02:13:21,893 --> 02:13:24,896
TECHSTAR COMPANY OR ARE THE

2930
02:13:24,896 --> 02:13:26,098
PROUDEST THAT IT HAS BEEN A

2931
02:13:26,098 --> 02:13:27,933
TECHSTAR COMPANIES?

2932
02:13:27,933 --> 02:13:30,802
DAVID: THERE ARE SO MANY

2933
02:13:30,802 --> 02:13:31,636
COMPANIES YOU ARE EXCITED TO BE

2934
02:13:31,636 --> 02:13:35,240
ASSOCIATED WITH, COMPANIES THAT

2935
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:36,007
WILL HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY THE

2936
02:13:36,007 --> 02:13:36,708
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR PUBLIC

2937
02:13:36,708 --> 02:13:37,108
COMPANIES.

2938
02:13:37,108 --> 02:13:38,410
DIGITAL OCEAN, CLASS PASS,

2939
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:44,348
THERE'S JUST SO MANY.

2940
02:13:44,348 --> 02:13:46,751
BB-8 IN THE "STAR WARS" MOVIE,

2941
02:13:46,751 --> 02:13:49,121
THAT CAME OUT OF TECHSTARS.

2942
02:13:49,121 --> 02:13:50,088
HUGE GROWTH.

2943
02:13:50,088 --> 02:13:52,724
WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF UBER

2944
02:13:52,724 --> 02:13:55,126
WENT THROUGH OUR ACCELERATOR.

2945
02:13:55,126 --> 02:13:55,860
WE WERE ABLE TO INVEST IN IT

2946
02:13:55,860 --> 02:13:57,629
THROUGH OUR EARLY VENTURE FUND,

2947
02:13:57,629 --> 02:13:59,231
BUT WE ARE JUST THRILLED TO BE

2948
02:13:59,231 --> 02:13:59,965
INVOLVED WITH SO MANY GREAT

2949
02:13:59,965 --> 02:14:00,732
COMPANIES THAT CHANGE THE WORLD

2950
02:14:00,732 --> 02:14:01,633
AND MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE.

2951
02:14:01,633 --> 02:14:03,635
EMILY: CAROLINE HYDE, SPEAKING

2952
02:14:03,635 --> 02:14:09,041
WITH TECHSTARS COFOUNDER DAVID

2953

COHEN.

2954
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:13,178
UBER HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL FOR A

2955
02:14:13,178 --> 02:14:14,346
FEW REASONS.

2956
02:14:14,346 --> 02:14:15,080
THE MEGA VALUATIONS.

2957
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:20,218
BUT AFTER DIDI'S TAKEOVER OF

2958
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:21,086
CHINA OPERATIONS, THEY NOW SHARE

2959
02:14:21,086 --> 02:14:24,122
A INVESTOR WITH THEIR BIGGEST

2960
02:14:24,122 --> 02:14:24,489
RIVAL.

2961
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:28,026
THAT IS A RARE PHENOMENON, AS

2962
02:14:28,026 --> 02:14:28,860
INVESTORS GENERALLY DO NOT BACK

2963
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:31,096
COMPETING STARTUPS.

2964
02:14:31,096 --> 02:14:37,368
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

2965
02:14:37,368 --> 02:14:42,140
>> RIDE HAILING HAS SEEN

2966
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:42,807
EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN RECENT

2967
02:14:42,807 --> 02:14:45,310
YEARS, MAKING IT ONE OF THE MOST

2968
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:46,211
LUCRATIVE SEGMENTS IN THE TECH

2969
02:14:46,211 --> 02:14:47,746
STARTUP SPACE.

2970
02:14:47,746 --> 02:14:50,115
TOGETHER, THE FIVE BIGGEST RIDE

2971
02:14:50,115 --> 02:14:52,984
HALOS ARE VALUED AT 115 BILLION

2972
02:14:52,984 --> 02:14:53,418
DOLLARS.

2973
02:14:53,418 --> 02:14:56,388
BY NOW, ALL KINDS OF BACKERS

2974
02:14:56,388 --> 02:14:57,322
HAVE A SLICE OF THE RIDE HAILING

2975
02:14:57,322 --> 02:15:02,294
HIGH, EVEN -- PIE, EVEN

2976
02:15:02,294 --> 02:15:03,061
NONTRADITIONAL INVESTORS LIKE

2977
02:15:03,061 --> 02:15:03,995
TOYOTA, GENERAL MOTORS, AND

2978

APPLE,.

2979
02:15:05,864 --> 02:15:07,065
BUT A SMALL GROUP OF 15

2980
02:15:07,065 --> 02:15:07,832

2981
02:15:07,832 --> 02:15:10,402

2982
02:15:10,402 --> 02:15:13,405
IN THE BIGGEST RIDE HAILERS.

2983
02:15:13,405 --> 02:15:18,410
SOFTBANK HAS INVESTED IN

2984
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:20,479
INDIA, SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND THE

2985
02:15:20,479 --> 02:15:25,517
LEADING RIDE HAILER IN CHINA.

2986
02:15:25,517 --> 02:15:26,851
ANOTHER HEDGE FUND HAS STAKES IN

2987
02:15:26,851 --> 02:15:29,421
DIDI AND LYFT.

2988
02:15:29,421 --> 02:15:32,524
AND DIDI NOW HAS BEEN INTEREST

2989
02:15:32,524 --> 02:15:38,496
IN EVERY MAJOR RIDE HAILER,

2990
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:39,164
INCLUDING ITS BIGGEST

2991
02:15:39,164 --> 02:15:39,698
COMPETITION, UBER.

2992
02:15:39,698 --> 02:15:42,767
SOME OF THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO

2993
02:15:42,767 --> 02:15:43,568
FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE DOMINANCE

2994
02:15:43,568 --> 02:15:46,471

2995
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:49,908
COUNTRIES, LENDING FIREPOWER TO

2996
02:15:49,908 --> 02:15:50,675
RIVALS IN REGIONAL MARKETS.

2997
02:15:50,675 --> 02:15:51,242
WHY DOES IT MATTER?

2998
02:15:51,242 --> 02:15:52,544
WE KNOW THE RECENT SALE OF

2999
02:15:52,544 --> 02:15:54,813
UBER'S BUSINESS IN CHINA WAS

3000
02:15:54,813 --> 02:15:55,580
FIRST EXPLORED BY INVESTORS WHO

3001
02:15:55,580 --> 02:15:58,550
WANTED A TRUCE WITH DIDI IN THAT

3002
02:15:58,550 --> 02:16:00,518

HAILING MARKET ARE IN FLUX, AND

3006
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,160
INVESTORS COULD SEE COMPETING

3007
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:12,664
INTERESTS CLASH AND THERE COULD

3008
02:16:12,664 --> 02:16:13,331
BE MORE CONSOLIDATION.

3009
02:16:13,331 --> 02:16:15,700
CAN UBER STILL WIN BIG IF IT IS
