00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a recent video natalie</font>

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,080
tran asked us what people would think of

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,060
us if they found our phone and just look

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,440
through the photographs to get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,880
of the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people we were after</font>

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,469
watching her video<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went through my</font>

7
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,900
phone and had a look at somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1200</font>

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,400
pictures that never made their way onto

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,680
my computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of quotations a</font>

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,660
picture of<font color="#CCCCCC"> kaylee's pinkberry a picture</font>

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,490
of ginger and lemon tea party<font color="#E5E5E5"> marsh I've</font>

12
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,439
been transported to someone who isn't me

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,810
so rude pictures of me holding the

14
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">killers new album text message</font>

15
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,260
screencaps usually for conversations

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,119
with legs and usually to do it somewhere

17
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,549
or another with auto correct free sample

18
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,170
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type in the word super hot it</font>

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">autocorrects to super hot the same base</font>

20
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gryffindor but then like NASA me</font>

21
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,110
curiously I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of pictures of</font>

22
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">fish my phone unter jewels and seahorses</font>

23
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,430
and fluffy things are dangerous and

24
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,750
piranhas and blurry fish yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a fan</font>

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,820
my photo booth is definitely more

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,739
embarrassing it involves a lot of before

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,870
going out pictures like do I look okay

28
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,239
our awkward face that's what is before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

29
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,250
go out i always<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the clueless wisdom</font>

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,869
don't trust mirrors always take

31
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,700
Polaroids in recent years I<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt like</font>

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,080
when you go out it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually look like standing in</font>

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,470
front of people it<font color="#CCCCCC"> matters what you</font>

35
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,270
photographs like I mean on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scale of</font>

36
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,040
mastery it doesn't and shouldn't matter

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,869
whatsoever but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I definitely find myself</font>

38
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,520
more conscious of what I look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like in</font>

39
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,840
the camera screaming than what I look

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
like right there people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who see me that</font>

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,650
night might not have a lasting memory of

42
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,970
you especially they've been drinking a

43
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,259
lot but when people take lots of

44
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,820
pictures that night becomes a reference

45
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,710
point for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole identity in a way</font>

46
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,329
that it shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> animal and I should</font>

47
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,220
really care about but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does and I do</font>

48
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,990
again it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what you look</font>

49
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,210
like it matters what you photograph like

50
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,610
hence<font color="#E5E5E5"> the album of the photograph face I</font>

51
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,259
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mirrors don't show the true me</font>

52
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in the cameras they show the true me</font>

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,090
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standing in front of me and</font>

54
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,590
seeing me doesn't show that you me and

55
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,960
yet i still find myself spending so much

56
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,000
time thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I'm seen is that</font>

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,860
vanity is that something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can ever</font>

58
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,270
escape and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think at some point</font>

59
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,009
mirrors are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become completely</font>

60
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,930
redundant instead fitting rooms will

61
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,850
have little live cameras bedrooms will

62
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,500
have large flat wall screens instead of

63
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,710
large flat mirrors

64
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,169
industry will fail and die I don't know

65
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,850
or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just that our definition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

66
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,830
mirror is itself changing I don't know

67
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,610
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is something I'm really</font>

68
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,290
interested in so put your thoughts in

69
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,390
the comments below also<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you realize</font>

70
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I said today was going to be a rosy</font>

71
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,290
answers video it's not because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

72
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,880
got sidetracked by this whole idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

73
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,650
mirrors but Rosie answers will be back

74
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,780
