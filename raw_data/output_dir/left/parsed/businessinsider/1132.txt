in order to succeed I think it's really
important to be doing something that you
love and that's deeply meaningful to you
I've talked to many people who want to
be successful but it doesn't seem to be
tied to anything they want the money
they want to prestige they want the
visible evidence of success but it's not
tied to something they feel passionate
about I think that's that's unhealthy
you can still succeed there are many
people who just want to make money and
do it but I think the more successful in
every sense of the word the more
personally fulfilled ambitious person is
going to be doing something that they
love and that's deeply meaningful to
them
