there is not a single peaceful multicultural society in the world that is the shock claim from the Dutch Foreign Minister Steph block who is facing a storm of criticism refugee groups and politicians alike have expressed dismay over block statements where he also dismissed former colonies Suriname as a failed state due to ethnic divisions bloc not only offends people that look like me but our whole national history and identity this is unworthy of a government official Minister bloc is undermining efforts by this government to make joint agreements in Europe on the proper reception of free Fiji's apparently the Minister is not aware of what is happening in Suriname our leaders have succeeded over the years to make all ethnic groups peacefully let each other live book has apologized for the remarks saying that they were meant to spark a debate and not to offend well that's trying to adjust and debate this issue now I'm joined by mohamed circle is a Ewing Connaught coordinator and the director with the J saw you 'the organisation and also independent journalist luke Reeve a good evening to you both gentlemen Luke what do you think of blocks comments some say that this is just out and announce racism it isn't racism I think and block says what most people think if you look at the Netherlands that the Prime Minister himself mark Reuters center-right just before the last elections published full pages in the press to use the populist language saying if migrants are not happy here they can go will expel them etc so at some points won elections threaten the central right or center left governments they adopt the talk of the populist and it's maybe what mr. block does here and he says things which are informally unfortunately real is that the multicultural societies that promised as the the perfect 21st century societies don't work don't function in the West at least in Western Europe Muhammad what do you think of Steph locks commented basically multiculturalism doesn't work show me the examples he says well yeah thank you for inviting me once again on Russia today I'm quite surprised to hear this from the Foreign Minister Dutch foreign minister knowing his country is safe haven for the multicultural people who arrived from different all across the world and live in you know peacefully in Netherlands I'm not sure the definition of him multicultural society is as societies talks about integration of different culture in one society or he think that we should divide people based on what on on a color or nationality or identity this is the question with the address what is the identity that we are not able to live together with if we look at England London is one example for example most is a cosmopolitan city that has been able to welcome and able to be a platform for multicultural society we can see the mixture of color the mixture of languages the mixture of even religion that live in and coexist in the UK I think this verse remark is just based on I'm sorry to say but it is ignorance of how can societies can bring together a big example I can I can I can show I can we can witness it is the World Cup the French team for example look the French team a French team contains a multicultural society from from from various areas of the BLA form from Algeria to Morocco to Africa that made this team successful otherwise it did made a successful team for multicultural basis Luc you can respond to that I can see you didn't agree fully well okay France beat another team from a small country from the Balkans and all the players in this small team were of the country of origin so there is no rule to be taken out of that and the French called there their football team Lally a lingerie so it is true that also many newspapers said that the victory of the French team was the victory of Africa so you see it is used both ways it it happens to that the race is sort of racialism developed by Mayan artists present in France with their pride and different things like that to meet the multicultural that doesn't function is when you have communities living next to each other and not mixing the melting pot which is the dream of America doesn't function in Europe the melting pot doesn't function that's the problem what do you think of that Muhammad does this you know neighbours we think backgrounds do do they mix yes if we if we if we provide if we provide the right tools and the right vision to how we can multicultural live if we provide that the media where we can stereotype one immigrant from another now if we stop hyping up the issue of immigration to Europe then we can live exist I could go back again to the UK because I lived in the UK 30 years and I'm from from the for Middle East and I've noticed how UK has evolved but it's not dissolved UK has evolved from from a country that has been a dull for years and to a country that have different different taste of music different taste over food and culture and they be able to live because they provided the method and the tool they can exist together if we don't if we can keep segregating the people yes we cannot live we can find a failed States but if we try to work to integrate and find a common interest between us and we can leaven exist we've seen this before in history and in civilization once again when people coexist together they can create creativity and we listen that in various places in Europe when creativity created for being multicultural society what do you think of that Luke block makes a mother very controversial comments including that it's linked to human genetics that that means that ethnic groups can't get along what do you think of that that went too far clearly but you know it nobody tries to create in Europe not nobody tries to segregate communities they do it themselves and it is very easy for example for Asians to to melt and and become member society but we have some some part of the population that refuses that want to impose their culture in the public space like Islam for example that's the main problem if not the only problem in Europe that's where we have the issue that's where the people feel there is an issue and the fake news is not what people think it is hiding it by the official press of Monsieur McCoy and others you know on the 14th of July in the evening or after the the football match there was looting on the shores it is a by the minority people coming from the areas of France where the police doesn't even dare go there were hundreds of cars burned and not the cars of the rich people on the cars of the poor people of the same area this should stop people have voiced the idea that Singapore was the perfect place where the mixing who was perfect true I've been there several times and Singapore is is perfect but Singapore is a very tough democracy on the the drug dealing there is punished with death penalty and if you tagged the walls you spent month cleaning it with a jacket saying I'm a pig so you know if you have a multicultural society you need to be very tough to impose that everybody respects the public space and respects also the culture of the country of origin and it is not the case now and that's why you have so many people in Europe who really refuse the society which is proposed by the by the politicians of the classical parties letting what do you think is that the point Mohammed Ali just may do democracies need to be tough in to have successful multiculturalism democracy can only be based on respect and hizmet as my colleague I mentioned is respect respect of each other culture respect it comes from also from from not to fear from other people culture from the other Society of beings not losing sense of belonging that's what we fear in Europe they feel they lose the sense of belonging to their own country they think that's because the other Society that the cultures has has came to this country trying to change the identity of Western Europe who has not happened and I'm it's not gonna happen no one is willing to change someone other identity but it's bringing a flavour different flavours to to one society but Singapore maybe is not good example but Malaysia we have multicultural society we have the Hindus we have the Chinese we have the Muslim we have the Malays and we have the different background living together in Malaysia and doesn't have a tough tough democracy in Malaysia but the idea of why we cannot live together is because we fear that the other person doesn't doesn't like us because we don't understand other person if we can open open a dialogue between each other not this dialogue that we see on TV between I don't know where the priest or the Imam no is the grassroot dialogue get to know each other culture you will find really rich rich connection between each other even genetically if we've been talking about the lien on the jeans then we can we cannot see how the Queen because each other German DNA to rule England for the last 500 years and this is the blood come from Germany so the blood is not the issue the issue is us how we accept each other not to fear from each other so this is the issue where we need to talk about why the Dutch is fair from other multicultural society to get down and understand there is not the issue of what if it is from Africa is poverty is the issue of he doesn't understand the law or the right of his his existence in Europe what do you think of that Luke is that all it is at the end of the day it's fear of a language you don't understand a religion we don't understand is it is it just divisions it and fear we we import misery we have a social security system which is based on the contribution of everyone and the problem is that the millions that come to Europe never participated they never contributed and they come with families look at the the ship that the the talents refused to welcome and that had to go to to Spain there were 140 young people under the age of 18 why do you think because the families in Africa send them to Europe knowing that there will not be expelled and that the families will be welcome in Europe at my expense at your expense at the expense of the people who live in Europe that's what the people don't want they don't want to pay internally for imported misery so this is part of the whole thing nobody listens to the poor in Europe ah nobody especially the Socialists and they should because the revolution is all in a certain way and populist appear everywhere sometimes even in the majority Mohammed just on the other side of this are you concerned about the sorry gone yes yeah well look look example of Africa look at example of the content of Africa if we have left Africa alone would not have seen African migrating to - to Europe if we have not will not have sucked the richness of Africa there Dimond there their goals their the oil then those people who would stayed in their own country that would yes yes no no if we have that's what happened in your result when they the lost the wealth they tried to invade the citizens quarter on please countries and then they complain why emigrant come back to Europe because you conquered they conquered those country and they impose laws they believe come back to with us if you want a migrating they asking for the black and the 60s to come and work in England and same for the Indian this is not people are how the choice is by force is not choice if I have to live in stay in my country with the wealth or I will stay in my country would not come to Europe this is this is nothing makes sense is we not leaving my family behind come just to suck your wealth in Europe this is okay let's just give a little chance to respond to that point you may wait to live anywhere go ahead look yes colonial times indeed in 1960 or 62 in we Europeans left these countries of course we should not have been there maybe but we left these countries with cities railways roads and everything airports everything is gone I mean their own elites have destroyed Africa completely and now they want to migrate to Europe so Europeans don't want it sorry you know minorities are welcome when they are minorities one it is a real invasion in the millions they say no and it doesn't stop and our government doesn't see don't seem to stop it so that's probably one of the reasons why brexit was so successful with more than 50% of the british voted for brexit voting for brexit because they saw what happened between turkey in europe and the fact that the migration could not be stopped by the european authorities so they said no to Europe so really there is a a grassroots feeling that we should preserve our culture and our identity minorities are welcome when they remain minorities man we've got about 30 seconds left I just wanna give you the final word on this the Prix it wasn't he wasn't he wasn't sent there because the migration of people African Asia because of of their work has come from East Europe but just to clarify this I I believe I believe that live in England for 30 years in Europe for over 35 years I believe because multicultural has made Europe as rich at this country and has made but as the Turks has run the German mackaninee know machines and factories and in India that's made the factories in in England and built that the trucks the wheels and everything this is what are the input of the multi culture you created this creativity and he made this this revolution that came with that we can see there's not by wiping someone else and it's not about you know imposing someone else culture in another I didn't see that I would like to see a really integration more gentleman appreciate your time and your forthright opinions thank you so much guys Muhammad so Cal you and coordinator with the Jaso youth organization independent journalist Luke Reeve a thank you guys you
