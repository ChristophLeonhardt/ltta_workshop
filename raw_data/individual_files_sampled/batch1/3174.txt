most experts agree that wearable tech is the next big thing oh and one of the biggest names in mobile has the first modern-day SmartWatch this is Samsung's Galaxy gear the Galaxy gear is an android-powered SmartWatch that connects to your smartphone via bluetooth right now it only works with samsung's new galaxy note 3 but samsung says it will add compatibility to other galaxy phones soon so what does it do the galaxy gear pairs with your smartphone via bluetooth to display incoming notifications like calls texts and emails there's a built-in speaker and microphone so you can make calls from your wrist without pulling out your phone hello there's also a camera on the wristband that lets you beam photos from the gear to your photo gallery on your phone as for apps the galaxy gear comes with a bunch of basic ones like a calendar and weather app and while there are some third-party apps available like snapchat Evernote and the social network path the app selection is pretty dim right now there's no Twitter no gmail no Facebook no Google Maps just about anything you'd think you need on a SmartWatch simply isn't there so is it any good not exactly the galaxy gear feels incomplete and it's still plagued by the things that can't do and what it can do it doesn't do very well first there's notifications the gear does a good job at showing incoming calls texts and emails if you use the Samsung email app but not a good job at shown you much else you can get an alert if you have new items in gmail Facebook or Twitter but you can't see what they say instead the gear tells you to look at your phone to get the details and that completely defeats the purpose of what a SmartWatch should be the gear should eliminate any need to pull out your phone every few minutes instead it arguably causes you to pull out your phone even more than before by constantly alerting you next comes to the design the gears clunky heavy and uncomfortable to wear on your wrist if I'm going to wear something all day I want it to look good but the gear is just the chunky shrunken down smartphone finally you have to manage most settings and apps on the gear using a special gear manager app on your phone that means you can't even install a new app to the watch without going through some settings on your smartphone first Samsung made a big bet by being the first to market with a modern-day SmartWatch but considering that the galaxy gear costs three hundred dollars only works with one specific model of a samsung phone and can't do a whole lot this is one device no one should buy
