he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound that much like a</font>

maverick although he<font color="#E5E5E5"> owns the Dallas</font>

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,870
Mavericks however he is refreshingly

00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,719
interested in ballot<font color="#E5E5E5"> access he wants</font>

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,460
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a chance to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a chance</font>

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,030
on the ballot so that candidates can

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,300
give voters more meaning to vote<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,310
there's more choice so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that about</font>

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">him as far as other issues remains to be</font>

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,350
seen but there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why his</font>

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,449
publicist got him on Meet the Press a

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,869
few weeks ago he's got ambitions I think

13
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,940
in 2020 he definitely run as a

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,190
third-party candidate I don't think he

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,989
can abide by what's been called the the

16
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,100
Trump dump the Republican Party I and he

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,320
certainly is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a chance</font>

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a democratic party of Hillary's</font>

19
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,250
electrics can run for reelection so

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,780
he'll listen he'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen to ross</font>

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,079
perot's example and see what he can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,120
in a three-way race he sees the polls

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,500
you know sixty percent of people would

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,539
like a viable third party etc so he's

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:00:00,000
got the money and he's got a personality
