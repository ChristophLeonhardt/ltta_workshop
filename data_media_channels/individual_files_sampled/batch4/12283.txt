Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought without the Steele dossier information which was ordered and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democrat Party is there a conspiracy at the FBI and other agencies to take down Donald Trump again I'm not sure I'm not a conspiracy person myself so I'm not gonna say that there's a conspiracy but if you if you think about the events today you have to ask yourself with the right protocols and checks and balances are in place in these situations to make sure that the politicization I said that properly of a agency that is supposed to be as non-political as possible to ensure the integrity of our system and our political system and our legal system or boy I think they've got to probably tighten that up a lot and this was the president was exonerated today on a lot of things that he'd be saying back in March Michael which you know that's absolutely right he was exonerated people were spewing fake news I know you know we talked at CNN is already trying to spin this thing they're saying it's a Republican memo it's this or that they're so frustrated that their lies had called out yet President Trump observed this he said top officials at the FBI and DOJ politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans do you think that means if he's exonerated today that it's time to fire Muller that's time to end this investigation again I I don't know I mean I'm not inside the White House anymore and I'm not part of those strategy sessions but my gut tells me it would be a bad move to fire Muller primarily because what ends up happening there and if you're not not to bore your listeners or viewers with history but when they fired Archibald Cox on the on that great Saturday evening massacre I think that put the administration into a tailspin I think they completely lost their footing I think the president's I'm pretty strong footing right now I saw reports this morning that he's got a forty nine percent approval rating post State of the Union address I thought was a spectacular from the State of the Union address and so he's got a lot of things going his way momentum wise the economy the right policies on the economy the right policies for the middle class and lower middle class families and so all of that together in the soup I would say don't fire Muller I believe that there's absolutely no collusion there I know the President believes that no collusion with Russia there's no right
