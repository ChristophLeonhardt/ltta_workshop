Scott Galloway professor of marketing and why you stern despite how outrageous ly expensive colleges it's still a pretty good plan B it's sort of in my opinion obscene at a billionaire with an undergraduate degree and a graduate degree is running around the nation trying to convince people to drop out of college it appears that it worked pretty well for him if you look at new millionaires over the last 20 years the vast majority of them have two things in common one is they work out everyday physical fitness is very important in terms of your own levels of confidence and avoiding things like depression and having more energy every day but the number-one thing all these folks have in common they went to college I just think it's obnoxious that a man who went to Stanford and then got a law degree and became a billionaire off of the credibility he was able to raise money off of is now telling kids to drop out of college I think it's noxious I mean if Steve Jobs or that Bill Gates was doing it they have some credibility or some license to say it but a guy with a graduate degree dropped out of college I tried to do this through Berkeley they didn't want to do it I said the burglar I said I'll give kids that picked 10 smart kid I just endowed with scholarship at Berkeley and I said let's track ten of them versus the ten to Teel and we're gonna win and they said well we don't want to Barriss the other kids but who would you bet on there are always going to be the jay-z's of the world there's going to be the Kobe Bryant's there's going to be the Mark Zuckerberg the people to drop out of college you should assume you're not that person and go to college
