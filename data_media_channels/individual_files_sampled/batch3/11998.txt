Russian trolls in the spotlight again this time US politicians and the media are accusing them of spreading discord with an American Society this now being connected to the recent Florida school shooting his artis Caleb Martin when informing us about the alleged danger of Russian BOTS and internet trolls American politicians have been very clear about the intent behind Russian conspiracies and sinister operations they want to sow division among the American people and one issue they've latched on to is the Second Amendment gun control debate apparently the Russians are very big fans of our Second Amendment they don't particularly want a second Amendment of their own but they're really glad that we have one the Russians would be thrilled if we were doing nothing but killing each other every day and sadly we are according to Facebook's security chief the Russians don't favor gun control or oppose it they just want to incite Americans against each other and make sure that we don't see eye to eye the ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights so Russian trolls are inflaming emotions over any sensitive issue guns included but it looks like we can locate some Russian BOTS not only on Facebook but who else is in flaming sentiments over that oh so sensitive Second Amendment they'll take away your Second Amendment which we will never allow to happen they'll take away you stack of the moment for some people that might be obvious but Trump isn't the only one sowing division many in legacy media love mass shootings you guys love it and then there's threatening messages against gun owners a billboard in Kentucky has been vandalized with the words kill the NRA that must be the work of Russian trolls also if you follow the premise it seems like mainstream American media is also working for the Russians left-leaning media outlets immediately calling for more gun controlled right-leaning outlets focusing on mental health Connecticut governor Daniel Malloy says President Trump and Republicans have blood on their hands after the deadly massacre in Florida they call it gun control but it's not it's people control when any organization spends tens of millions of dollars promoting the interests of gun corporations to influence what happens in our elections then yes our democracy is a little broken Americans on both sides of the issue are now screaming at the top of their lungs from the highest levels of government to child survivors of mass murder accusations are flying everywhere now if this is all just some big plot from Moscow we really have a big problem here in America I have been doing this professionally in terms of you know this type of commentating for 30 years now and in 30 years I think before the Russian BOTS came along they'd been saying the same thing every single time in my native Florida so I know something about this so if the Russians are claiming to take credit for involving themselves and insinuating themselves in this particular argument is they're too late because this has been going on for 30 years and nothing's changed
