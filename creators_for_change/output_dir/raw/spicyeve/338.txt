25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,420
found that easier than going to like

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,640
five million different websites and

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,189
entering your information I look like

28
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,420
you could probably to paypal but

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,530
regardless I don't have one of those

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,490
henceforth curl marcom number one price

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,680
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are both twelve dollars</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,200
are both eight ounces expensive but I

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,330
have yet to find anything cheaper

34
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,370
that even looks like we were I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

35
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">know why my camera's doing this weird</font>

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,300
watery um they run I don't know can hear

38
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,690
that pours out like like like that a

39
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,730
little goes a long way for both of them

40
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,790
um you only need like a dime<font color="#CCCCCC"> size or</font>

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,070
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other one nickel nickel sized</font>

42
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,250
amount bring your whole head um yeah

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,810
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only smell it comes in can</font>

44
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">curly only has one labor of leave-in</font>

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,850
conditioner as opposed to darts

46
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,640
botanicals has um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> three vanilla</font>

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,490
something else and<font color="#CCCCCC"> is juicy peach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crow</font>

48
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,050
marcom only has vanilla delight as of

49
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">now I believe so oh so if you're a peach</font>

50
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,990
fanatic sorry they're both very slippery

51
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,510
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that I think these are</font>

52
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,820
interchangeable it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,190
texture is the same the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistency is</font>

54
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,209
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ingredients are the same in</font>

55
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:20,920
that are not the same ingredients what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,440
mean by that is they pretty much stick

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,680
to natural ingredients I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea if</font>

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,989
these are good detanglers both of these

59
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,870
are also marketed as you can d tangle

60
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,060
with it but who detangles at the very

61
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,459
end like with your leave in conditioner

62
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,769
like that's a lot you need a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

63
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:41,620
water and they leave in conditioner for

64
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,230
that

65
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're just looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for something to</font>

66
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,769
dab on your fro to make it a little

67
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,620
moisturized<font color="#E5E5E5"> luscious these are</font>

68
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,260
definitely the way to go in my opinion

69
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,660
um yeah interchangeable products right

70
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,610
here I promise I promise this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

71
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">perk you know I'm finished with this one</font>
