so scandal is not an exact science but on a scale of nothing burger to worse than Watergate the information in the House Intelligence Committee FISA memo comes in at about a seven we'll talk about that later but for now suffice it to say if this sort of thing had gone on under President Trump or even under president george w bush the new york times a former newspaper would have announced the news and front page headlines so large it would have taken two strong men just to carry the letters to the press room an enormous collection of times reportage on the subject with a black cover and some title like the path to tyranny would have been on the bookstore shelves within the month instead america's new centers from 42nd street in manhattan all the way to 57th street in manhattan did everything within their power to suppress taint and minimize the impact of the memo even before they knew what was in it some of us who still go to the movies just sat through steven spielberg's the post a to our left wing talking point about how brave the washington post was when it defied President Nixon's concerns over national security in order to expose government malfeasance by publishing the Pentagon Papers yet now news outlets plead to keep secrets to keep secrets in the name of national security and warned us in the satirical words of a headline in the onion that the memo could undermine our faith in massive unaccountable government secret agencies and after decades of listening to leftists Kree about J edgar Hoover's unjustified wiretapping the leftist media is now telling us that a little unjustified FBI wiretapping now and again is a nothing burger in short a press the Shoreham principle be hungry for every piece of information that might be damning to the powerful of every stripe has made it clear that they do not want you to know what they do not want to know themselves the truth is both the memo itself and the press is unforgivable lack of curiosity about the memo are part of a much bigger scandal within a scandal the memo represents just one more jigsaw piece in a picture of the Obama administration as a chicago-style Democratic machine rife with cronyism and abuse of power a machine to which the media closed its eyes we know this it's not conjecture we know that Obama's IRS made successful efforts to silence conservative voices during the president's reelection campaign we knew know that the IRS also targeted Jewish groups that supported Israel we know that Obama's Secretary of State lied to cover up the disaster in Benghazi his attorney general held a secret powwow with Bill Clinton while his wife was under investigation and now we begin to learn that the Obama Justice Department may have colluded with a Democrats campaign in order to spy on a Republicans and all this went on while journalists kowtow to flattered and ultimately raved about the administration being scandal free for eight years those of us who asked with the ancient Roman poet Juvenal who will guard the guardians were answered by the self-styled heroes of journalistic truth-telling not us that's the real scandal here and it's finally beginning to come out trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show anybody now people did watch the superball I mean I was a great it was a wonderful wonderful game everybody stood for the national anthem pink singing the national anthem and you know rob was pointing out to me that the Philadelphia Phillies were the only team the Philadelphia Eagles were the only team that didn't ever protest the the flag that never kneel for the national anthem and they of course won and then if then we had Nick Foles coming on afterwards and he is a guy wants to be a pastor after he's finishing finished being a quarterback and the winning quarterback for the Eagles and he came on and started singing the praises of Jesus apparently I mean know folks was on the on the brink of quitting he was just gonna he was really just a replacement quarterback and instead now he's got a Super Bowl ring amazing the last guy who did that was Tim Tebow right there last guy who came back from nowhere to win the Super Bowl is Tim Tebow something there are magic in this Jesus juice what's that didn't Tebow win that first the Super Bowl he was in the table not make it into the bowl are you sure wait a minute wait a minute I will like I just want to check this the Tim Tebow never won this people I'm just misremembering that that's awful yeah that's that's awful that I must remember that's terrible maybe then not to use I just had that memory of him winning a super one never mind never mind now I've ruined my entire point you know it's terrible when your memory conflates stuff like that but but the thing is that the whole point that I was trying to make was that the entire tenor of the Super Bowl was patriotic full of religion and it's like if you don't think that Donald Trump is changing our culture and chasing these guys back into the corners and there and the rat holes where they belong he is it is really a big difference you may have noticed also that it's February which is the shortest month of the year which means you haven't got a lot of time if you want to get life insurance in February or something the thing is you want to get life insurance before you need to life insurance that's the important

is that's what the that clips are back thank heavens I mean I thought I was gonna have to talk through this entire show so let's talk about this Pfizer memo we never got a chance after its release what it tells us what it doesn't tell us so many people hyping it on the right but also there's people running it down on the left the press running it down on the left which is unbelievable what's in it it says the FBI and the Justice Department if the memo is true they use this steel dossier this Oppo research that was paid for by the DNC and Hillary Clinton and this this talking point again that was originally paid for by the free beacon is not true the free beacon hired fusion GPS but they did nothing to do with the steel dossier which only came in after the Democrats hired these people so they used this to get a FISA warrant to spy on an American citizen Carter page now Carter page is a Russian sympathizer he got into trouble with the feds before because he was hanging out in Russia with a guy who later became a spy he was investigated he was never charged with anything and so we don't know whether he's a dirty guy or not but they were spying on him and he had just left about a month before he had just left his volunteer role in the Trump campaign okay so they wanted to spy on the sky and he'd recently left the Trump campaign and they did not tell the FISA Court according to the memo they did not tell the FISA Court that this dossier was paid for by the DNC and they didn't tell him that it was in the were using the words of James Comey salacious and unverified and this is a violation it's a violation according to sharyl Attkisson the investigative reporters a violation of the FBI's own procedures the FBI has something called the woods proceed procedures which are strict rules requiring that each and every fact presented in an FBI request to electronically spy on a US citizen the extreme vetted for accuracy and presented to the court only if verified and for obvious reasons right the FISA FISA courts don't turn down that many applications for warrants so we you know we have to trust our government we have to trust our government to only ask to spy on Americans when they might be dangerous agents of a foreign government that's the only time the thing is now this this this memo doesn't necessarily taint Robert Mahler's investigation into the Russian collusion idea although why there's a special counsel doing investigation into something that's not a crime I don't know but it doesn't necessarily take that in the memo it does say that this guy Papadopoulos was the thing that jump-started the memo he was in Australia he got drunk he told some people that the Russians had emails damaging to the Hillary Clinton campaign that of course turned out to be partially true because they had because Podesta had given them they they fished him before his first password so they've gotten in and that's what's jump-started the campaign but but this is not in the memo but it's very hard to believe that they went after Carter page as their main target here the guy isn't nobody he's not some big guy that they were gonna have some big investigation of it really does seem it's a it's a fair conjecture let's put it this way that they went after Carter page to tap into the Trump campaign if that turns out to be true and we don't know that yet if that turns out to be true then the scandal meter goes into the red zone so so those are what that's what we have right in any in any world every journalist would be on top of this right every one of them would be salivating let's get some more information let's find out where this goes how far did this go do they did the Democrats use the federal government oh my goodness they would be saying in this make-believe world that the Democrats use the federal government to bug a Republican presidential campaign that would almost be like colluding with the right I'd be worse than colluding with the Russians that would truly be a scandal so every red-blooded reporter is out there trying to get there let's just have a montage if we have a montage here it comes from gray bein of the press I mean these are just Democrat talking points coming out of the faces of the press about after this memos release was a cut five I could tell you from reading this memo and consulting with a wide range of experts it's a dud this memo is a duck nothing a dud but it is nothing and nothing burgers and less interesting about this memo is what what is in it it's pretty much a nothing burger nothing dishonest misleading partisan nothing burger the only thing I fear from this memo because I think it's really been a huge done some of the GOP Tea Party members were out there saying that this is the most vile thing they'd ever seen and it's a big dud it's a dud unfortunately it fell flat yesterday much I think to the chagrin of the president this memo is a complete dud talk about the collusion is a Democrat Party colluding with the press hears ears when I just love I mean I what I wonder when I watch is did they hear themselves do they think we don't hear them do they think we're stupid yes they do they must think we're stupid here's George snuffleupagus the Clinton hack I love you Hillary Clinton act running this panel listen to the logic of this panel that basically by releasing this memo by giving me the people information they are we're all now working for Putin when you think about the investment that Vladimir Putin made in intervening interfering in our elections it is paying off every day in spades he he won the Super Bowl he really Putin has won the Super Bowl hear exactly what he wanted to happen in this country this is discord this mistrust of institutions is exactly why they operate just a year a year they do nothing but report on this story and bring and they know the people don't care the people don't care the people you know at home going hey there's more money in my paycheck hey I have a job hey this is kind of good things are going well they know that people don't care they pull them nobody is talking about this Russia investigation these guys do it they serve Vladimir Putin every day by doing this and then when somebody says oh and by the way the collusion was between the Democrats and the Russians it's like you're working for Putin but what I love about him is I always compare them to the last scene and singing in the rain the old musical where the woman is singing and to get she's a nasty woman and she's actually dubbing the woman who's singing behind the curtain and they opened the curtain so the audience can see that this woman is a total fake that press this has happened to the press the curtain is open we can all see it they just haven't looked behind them yet it's that we see the Democrat Party standing behind them while they mouth the words all right but before I love them that I love them they're there providing the comedy they can't you know when you think about this in the right way what is happening is the boil of the corrupt Obama administration's being lanced and it's all coming out so it has this feeling of like yeah there's all this stuff coming up but it's actually a good thing it's positive thing for the Republic Valentine's Day is coming and again this is a short month so it comes back I don't even know

these commentators trying to play down this memo trying to pull us off the memo were two of my favorites one of them is this clown Phil Mudd as a former CIA guy as now is CNN operative and his argument his argument why we should not do this we shouldn't expose the deep state because the deep state will kill us because Phil Mudd threatening the elected president of the United States with the deep state and saying and we shouldn't we shouldn't reveal this information because they're gonna hate come after the president so the FBI people I'm gonna tell you are ticked and they're gonna be saying I guarantee it you think you can push us off this because you can try to intimidate the director you better think again mr. president you've been around for 13 months we've been around since 1908 I know how this game is gonna be played we're gonna win oh maybe if you don't want us to feel there's a conspiracy you shouldn't threaten elected officials with unelected deep state secret guys make us all feel better and Adam Schiff the reliable McCarthyite Adam Schiff boy he is like a clock he just goes you know he just he just keeps the time perfectly you just know he's gonna go off with this stuff and Democrats are so invested in this panic mongering again again I I know that the people the people who believe them the people who are in their camp their base I I guess they're nodding and saying yes yes yes but the rest of us the people who can think I'm not just talking about the base of the Trump base I'm talking about the people in the middle on whom elections depend they have I have to believe that they are listening to this and going rolling their eyes give me a break here is Adam Schiff telling us if if we publish information that lets us know about our government the terrorists win and sources of information are going to dry up if you have a neighbor next door who's buying a lot of fertilizer and it seems odd to you because they don't have a yard are you gonna think twice but before calling the FBI because if they get a search warrant for your neighbor and and something is politicized the political winds change and there's an investigation your identity is going to be revealed because you really can't trust that this is going to be kept confidential anymore there's a reason why this process has never been used before but even so the process presumed that the president ID states who has a veto over this would be a responsible person who would have the interest of the nation at heart what why would anybody need to buy fertilizer when we have Adam Schiff talking you got a plenty of fertilizer telling us if we find out what the deep state is doing if we find out that there was malfeasance at the top of the Obama administration's Justice Department which there was we already know there was we know he corrupted the IRS we know he corrupted state by making Hillary lie about Benghazi we know he corrupted the Justice Department by getting the Hillary off the hook and he lied to us about whether he knew about her email we all we know this stuff I mean this is not me you know this is not like me just going off on Democrats we know that this guy I believe that Barack Obama slowly began to understand that the press would not touch him no matter what he did if he had strangled Michelle in the Rose Garden the press would have said a new trend killing your wife isn't that what you know I mean really the press was so in the tank for him and as he realized that he just continually corrupted the government turned it into the Chicago style machine and as I always say he didn't corrupt it for himself he corrupted it for his ideology he was not money corrupt he was ideologically corrupt and so is the press the press is exactly the same no campus reform I love these guys they go out and they do these funny interviews to show us how a skewed campus people's minds are at colleges they went out and did this video where they told people lines from Obama's State of the Union and then told them it was Trump's State of the Union and this is not off the topic I play those four to make a point but let's just listen for a minute first talking about Isis saying quote we need to call them what they are killers and fanatics throughout to be hunted down and destroyed what's your thought on that well first of all I spake with something the government made up so they can continue doing what they want to do we're just broke down the nation Donald Trump shit like you know mind his own business and like just focus on America because he's the president of the United States not of the whole world I feel like that's a very strong statement when you say something like that it kind of makes you like or if your threat to this country we're gonna get you for that is it's just ridiculous next up talking about the general world stage saying quote when you come after Americans we come after you it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limit what's your thought on that I don't think that's a good way of handling something it's like he doesn't think before speaking and how how it's going to offend a lot of people he should be careful because there's other countries out in the world that has like you know like automatic weapons and you know nuclear bomb so when they think it's Trump speaking they hate it but it's actually Obama speaking so with college kids we can forgive this because you know they're worried about important things like taking drugs and having sex but but you know this is the press this is the press they have this is what they've been reduced to and they were reduced to it when they were in college but you know it's a chain of it's a chain of cause and the fact that these colleges have been taken over by leftists they teach them leftism they then go out into the world and become reporters and every time they hear something that comes out of trumps mouth it's bad everything they hear every time they hear something that comes out of Obama's mouth it's good plus plus with the press and especially with the generation I hope I hope it'll be different it's very hard to imagine it will be but I hope it'll be different with the generation coming out but there is a racial pathology with these people the Democrats I think I've quoted this before Andrew Breitbart used to say that the Democrat Party was like a mallomar it was a thin brown crust protecting this massive white Center and and the way they keep that brown crossed meaning African Americans the way they keep the black people so protective is by manipulating our legitimate guilt over our historical you know sins against black people and those are real and they manipulate our legitimate guilt to make us feel that any time we criticize black people or a black person we're doing something racist or wrong so Trump goes out and he says you should stand up for the flag they say well those players are black and they're complaining about some black so that's racist that's nonsense if you're not racist if you're not racist you judge people strictly on the content of the character and on their actions and if the actions are wrong they're wrong and if they're right they're right and certainly the press should just be eager for the truth the press being a reporter is what I call a metaphor being an artist is a meta profession sure you have politics sure you have opinions but you leave them behind your purpose is to get the truth and to have an entire industry whose purpose they've been telling us what heroes they are how they're speaking truth to power to have an entire industry essentially protecting power from the truth is a shame it really is it's a scandal you know I didn't mention this that we had a little mess-up at the beginning with the sound so I got a little buzzed and I forgot to mention that Michael Knowles is here to talk about the ads in the Super Bowl and he will be coming up in just a moment but first first if you are a lady and you want to get something for your husband or boyfriend on Valentine's Day and you want it to be you know if you get him something nice and romantic he will tell you he likes it because that's how we roll we lie to you so you leave us alone but if you want to get him something that he'll really like and I know if you're a great wife or girlfriend you will you will try man crates Isle of Man I was I was using man crates last night as I was drinking my way through the Super Bowl I got the the scotch appreciation box

Knowles is coming up right after this all right have we got Knowles is he they're bringing them in by satellite you are in Kentucky right now you're in the next one bureaus broom closet so you you actually watched all the ads actually I watch the ads this year I don't always but I watch this was one you know I I don't really care for sports that much I like baseball but I don't really care for the Super Bowl I was waiting them I was salivating for all the absurd crazy leftist stupid ads just like we got last year and I knew it was gonna make a great fodder for for this segment and then do you know what happened Donald Trump won the culture it was pretty good the ads were pretty good the game is pretty good yep I am is very this is the first assignment you've given me in years I think it wasn't just misery inducing and suicide sleep it was a complete mistake on my or athina fight if I had known believe me I would add you watch the puppy the you know I think there were three kinds of ads last year there was just one kind of ad and it was the anti-trump ads right with every single one that's right that's right no last I don't know if you remember this I wrote out a little list of them last year Budweiser ran an ad about how great immigrants are coca-cola did one of singing America the Beautiful in different languages you know to really stick it to Trump now he made one about women driving race cars for sexism or whatever Handmaid's Tale ran a commercial about Handmaid's Tale and I said Airbnb made one about the travel ban a shampoo company made one about how terrible Trump's hair is on and on and on this year there were three kinds of ads political ads slacktivism astad and and genuinely funny normal ads about the product and the the great irony here is the most political ad of the night was pro Trump which was referral America it was an ad by WeatherTech and the weather tech yes they actually ran a line it said just write on the screen at WeatherTech we built our new factory right here in America isn't that the way it's supposed to be yes and it looked like they were building a wall you know it's very kind of like looked like the wall going up there very much and there was one where Ronald Reagan was the last voice you heard on it I can't remember which one that was right yeah that's so it was a very pro-american very pro-american ads and then there were a couple coca-cola assaulted the English language they used the gender-neutral vay do we have a cut of that there's a Coke for he and she and her and me there's a different coke for all of us no Coke for them just me and her and there's no no them but anyway whatever that's fine it wasn't terribly antitrump t-mobile did one with a bunch of babies that was one of my least vikander reeves ad was the stupidest ad but that was my least favorite I had that that seemed old it was so lazy it was just a bunch of babies winding a bed equal pay or something but even on that ad CBS MoneyWatch gave it an F the consensus among the ad buyers and the ad makers yeah was that it was a terrible ad that basically was all of the political ads the the anti-trump thing they clearly learned something from last year there was another class that seems political but they're different and those are the slack divest ads that was Matt Damon telling you to buy a stella artois right mug so that you can I don't know give water to a billion people in India or something it's because though I've been reading a number of studies about this Millennials love vague humanitarian activism you know when I go out to those African blazes because they don't have no fresh water example they speak more people yeah you buy the Stella Artois that's now get him some water whoever they are somewhere that will be water it's a could you pass me the bottle please exactly well you're on your couch but this study shows half of Millennials think CEOs have a responsibility to talk about social issues half of them are more likely to buy from activists CEO was see yeah was it this explains something and actually makes me feel a little bit better about that t-mobile a because I sit and watch that t-mobile and you know what I'm thinking the whole ad was babies of different colors and you know we're all together and equal pay and everybody some people may not like you I was sitting there thinking what the hell are you talking to you know you calling me a bigot you little piece of garbage I like take your t-mobile and that's the way I'm feeling but I guess I guess Millennials are sitting there going yeah now I'll buy that phone because we're all one the other thing t-mobile could have said is do you want to not have service in eighty percent that test as well in the focus group no matter who you are no matter who you are you will not get service which we implement the same I think that's it though I don't think that they were sitting saying yes we need to fight the social issue I think they were talking to the ad makers who say you know 68 percent of Millennials say a company's social and environmental commitment is extremely important when deciding of which products to buy I wonder they say that I wonder how true that is when they actually go out and buy that I wonder but you do see all of these ads doing it so you TOMS shoes is the great example this company that gives shoes to poor people or something yeah and they make terrible shoes the quality is awful but people buy them because they feel like they're doing something activist the crazy one did you see the Dodge Ram commercial oh my that was that wasn't bad I was embarrassed for that one I mean I said where how it good isn't there like a series of people who can stop that ad you know I always wonder this one you know I've been in I've been in the movie development process with with scripts and you know there's all these people saying to you oh well this doesn't make sense and why is the gun over here when he left it in the kitchen and all the sudden and then you actually go to the movies and the movies their plots you could drive a Dodge truck through there their plaza and you think where were those people well I saw that Ram truck ad I just thought why didn't anybody stop this thing why didn't anybody read the speech that they had Martin Luther King was speaking and giving this speech about service and greatness over the truck Edmund said right 50 years ago to the day Martin Luther King gave the speech in the speech Mart I decided just a quick little google search of the speech he said quote we are so often taken by advertisers you know those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion and they have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you into buying in order to be a man of distinction you must drink this whiskey in order to make the neighbors envious you must drive this type of car he probably goes on to talking about Dodge itself but but it was kind of like you know it's Martin Luther King he's a put a serious important guy you know it's like it's just a truck and then did you see the jeep truck yeah that mean that is the kind of answer I got if I'm stepping on mic on your go ahead you do it no no there were there were answers to these ads I mean some of them absolutely nailed it and some of them were just Martin Luther King they were trying a little too hard we're you know Jeep climbing up rocks or something yeah clearly understand what this product is and I think it's because I think that the takeaway here is that the people who are creating the culture the ad makers in Hollywood and in New York they're still lagging behind the American people they still don't quite get it they're very blunt instruments it's it still vaguely smacks of hey fellow kids what are y'all doing you know I have you know trying to be part of them but it's much better than it was last year that are catching up because we're just talking about these slacktivism political ads the majority of them were just kind of funny they were just regular ads yet with actors making funny faces and Morgan Freeman rapping or whatever and that is a vast vast improvement and you'll be shocked to hear me say this we do have to give credit to Donald Trump for this phenomenon there's just no question I mean first first of all they were look there was a lot of postmodern ads in the tide ad which was my favorite ad of the thing I really like that where they would just have a different approach and it was a different ad and then they would say oh but look how clean everybody sure it is it's a tie-dye really you know and and that was very postmodern the jeep thing was very postmodern because they talked about manifesto ads which the Dodge truck ad was and they said this is our manifesto just drive that will do it but but yes you know even the movies with the rock he's got obviously he's playing a veteran he's missing a leg and these guys got me not to save his family what would you die for I'd die for my family you know and the Mission Impossible one was unpolitical looked like a really fun action movie but it's just as if somebody you know my friend Glenn Reynolds who's the inste pundit or as we call him the blog father because he was the great leading leading blogger of his day and he always says go woke go broke and and I think that somewhere along the line some of these guys started to scratch their head and say oh they don't like that's when they when we hate their God and their country you know maybe if we want to sell them beer we should be nice to them I mean cuz that's it you know we we have been we've been standing them up and I think we should keep doing it and I think Trump has been a cheerleader for that and I think they're getting learning they'll keep the pressure on it could you imagine if we had been talking a year ago and all the main stories that dominate are the players kneeling for the national anthem and Colin Kapernick and this and that and we have to change team names yeah an anti-trump and all of that and then what happened people stopped watching in the ratings plummeted and people are cutting their cords to basic cable then ESPN has totally lost its mind Sports Illustrated people are canceling their subscriptions and believe it or not we were able to get something out of it the culture is swinging a little bit back toward reason and not hating the country and not hating our fellow countrymen and this is not the time to go weak this is not the time to say right how wonderful we have to stand up we have to support the cultural agenda that the wrecking ball of a cultural warrior Donald Trump is leading the charge to fight it really is amazing it is like the people you know it's like with the immigration thing that people aren't saying no immigration they're saying you know if you bring 15,000 people into my town with 3,000 people we can't assimilate them the people know this stuff they have a complete accurate sense of it they know when there's been too much and it's just these guys they will not listen but hopefully the thing that would make them listen more than anything I was thinking this is I'm watching this is if if Trump actually wins the midterm or he doesn't lose the house in the midterms I think that that would wake these clowns up I think finally they would start to say oh oh I get it other people don't want this we're not serving we're not doing our jobs all of historical precedent would suggest that Trump is going to lose the midterm that will lose the house or something like that yeah and yet those models only work in not normal years that is not a normal year it's true if the Republicans held the house in the mid term the that that is the mandate that is the mandate that we have that we've rightly been claiming since November 2016 but that is a clear mandate that the American people are they're concerned about basic things about the economy of a tax reform about deregulation but all of that is just accounting because politics is downstream of culture and Americans have had enough with a decayed culture that hates them and they're finally fighting back it's great that is great to see what's on the Michael Knoll show today we are talking about we don't want to get too controversial today not so we're just talking to a Catholic priest about gay marriage we're just talking that's interesting that'll do that'll be really interesting the Catholic line he is he hasn't become a heretic yet he hasn't been excommunicated yet wait until he's on my show though yeah and but it is a question that for some reason this is the question that pre occupies everybody's mind for the last ten years even though it affects a relatively small number of people and we will debate whether or not conservatives should get on the gay marriage train or whether there is some other path that we can follow in in our culture that's that sounds great even I might watch it hey you know speaking of Knowles I have to talk about this story in from Manchester England where some clown and the Manchester art museum there one is to take this painting down and they actually got to take him down do we have the image of this painting this is Hylas and the nymphs it's a it's one of my favorite paintings is from the pre-raphaelites i think his name was john Waterson is there water stone is that his name and yeah water how sorry John water house the pre-raphaelites are some of my favorite painters because what they did was they saw abstraction and Impressionism coming and they said no no let's go back to Raphael let's go back to the Prix Raphael and they started to paint these very very beautiful very lush images of mythology and religion and they were just there really just spectacular and this one is Hylas in the nymphs Hylas was actually hercules as a toy boy he was supposed to be this very beautiful youth and you know what the Greeks are like and so they were too gay and he went into the woods and the nymphs who beautiful nymphs you see them coming out of the water they drew him into the water and he drowned and a lot of people not a lot of people several people have asked me whether this was the inspiration for the scene in another Kingdom starring Michael moles where Austin is in fact led off by Thames and he has a much different much different experience with the names and the answer is yes it is this is what inspired that scene it is a beautiful painting that's in my a lot like all of the pre-raphaelites and I did want to capture some of that pre-raphaelite beauty of mythology and everything so if you are listening to another Kingdom and you haven't come up to that scene yet or you remember the scene where Austin meets the nymphs in the wood that this is in fact the inspiration for Italy let's say it was what was in my mind as I was describing the scene didn't work out so well for Hylas works out great for Austin you can listen to another Kingdom alright it is time for our crappy culture so a while back I was talking about the devil wasn't that long ago I did an opening about the devil and I talked about the fact that I've come to believe that I didn't always believe in the devil even when I had become baptized but slowly over time I began to see that it just made a lot of sense that there was in fact a conscious force in the world that tries to draw you away from God it tries to draw you into that emptiness that is away from God and I you know when you once you start to notice it you can notice thoughts in your head that are just like and against everything that's good for you everything that you are everything that you believe in everything you want in these thoughts come in the Checotah entice you away and one of the main ways this happens I've always noticed is through rationalization if you do something wrong and you say oh man I just I just made a moral error I did something bad I'm a human being I hope God will forgive me I'm gonna go talk to the people I did it to and that hope they forgive me you're free and clear you know I mean assuming you didn't kill anybody assuming you didn't do anything that can never be reworked God may forgive you for those things but sometimes people won't but if you just made an error you're not going to go down to the next error if you experience the pain and humiliation of admitting your guilt because you're gonna settle would that happen again and you become a better person if if you cannot admit for various reasons whether it's political reasons whether it's because you support Donald Trump or you support Barack Obama whatever it is if you make a mistake a moral mistake and you cannot admit it you begin to rationalize in the process of rationalization so it wasn't that bad in fact it was good it was a good thing in fact I'd do it again in fact I will do it again and that is when the devil gotcha he gets ya know because once you start doing that rationalization thing you start going down this road where the good becomes evil and the evil becomes good and it goes on and on forever there is a clip that was put out of comedians at a pro-abortion fundraising rally and this is Sarah Silverman and some other comedians and turn this off if you're going to be upset by ugliness because it is truly ugly I don't think there's we've left any obscenities in it but the whole thing is an obscenity the comedians they're all female comedians trying to get donations for pro-abortion rally including Sarah Silverman and they're pretending to play charades and then Sarah Silverman steps in with her calm so Shapiro always gives me a hard time because I feel sorry when I see this happened to people I look at these people and I think oh my god you know they have really truly degraded themselves by following this path of rationalization by saying like look you know I can understand why women want abortions I can understand they get into terrible terrible situations I can understand how a small thing becomes such a huge thing as a human being a small thing is a night of unprotected sex that went by and you know whatever in a half an hour and and now you've got something for life I understand it's it's a very terrible thing that but once you start to really think about it once you start to really think that this is a human being that this is a unique piece of DNA it's not your DNA it's a whole new blueprint for a human being and very very quickly becomes a human being and you know once you start to say that you have to say you know this is just not the solution this is not the solution but if you don't do that you become what those people are you've just become too great a human being you you know if you're sitting out there making jokes about eating unborn babies you know you have become degraded it's not that funny it's not funny at all really but it's so ugly and that I see that coming out I feel from people like that because you know I I have true faith that every one of those babies who doesn't make it to birth is going to be taken care of and come before God but I also have faith that these people are going to come before God and I don't want to be there all right tomorrow we have Howard Kurtz he's a guy I really admire he was one of the first people
