00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,300
of repeating them

60
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:31,000
have changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> too um if you mean maybe</font>

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,530
it's just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that you guys have</font>

62
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,500
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to me where's before maybe you</font>

63
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">hadn't got used to me so you thought it</font>

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,590
was different<font color="#E5E5E5"> but maybe now you've got</font>

65
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,510
used to be so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I've</font>

66
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,000
changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh what else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could it be let me</font>

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,810
think we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we but</font>

68
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you guys mean that the old</font>

69
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,000
dealer was somebody who may be dressed

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,180
prettier or dressed you know nicer or

71
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,920
girly<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something that you prefer it</font>

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,750
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine but there's no need to</font>

73
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,050
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> rude about the style that is emerging</font>

74
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,690
now because to be honest with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I'm</font>

75
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,540
sick of the typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that outfit is</font>

76
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,340
still pretty therefore it's very nice

77
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,260
kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just because you</font>

78
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean it is you</font>

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,630
know I mean is everything just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

80
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,459
typical nowadays just like oh yeah it

81
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,250
she's wearing pink trousers and a blue

82
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,800
top and has cos pic so it matches so it

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,560
makes sense in my head so it's hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

84
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,820
just because you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

85
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,070
something doesn't mean you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> diss</font>

86
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,260
it do you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it as well</font>

87
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you want to reply saying oh we</font>

88
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,459
got me to be rude etc we don't mean to

89
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,020
we just want to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do that</font>

90
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,940
but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's rude you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it you</font>

91
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's going to provoke anger you</font>

92
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,120
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a fact you're not stupid</font>

93
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,660
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually just think and read your</font>

94
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
comments back to yourselves

95
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,620
and if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize that they're</font>

96
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,670
rude all their pointless comments I

97
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,080
don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there then you are just</font>

98
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">an absolute horrible better I think</font>

99
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,380
style hey jebby style really there's

100
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">just such a huge obvious difference in</font>

101
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,820
it in each country for example

102
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,580
australian fashion hey jebby fashion is

103
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,690
so different to London hijabi fashion

104
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Australia one's really girly and really</font>

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,810
pretty you know I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

106
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,029
it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> feminine but the London</font>

107
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:27,160
hijabis tend to have more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or they</font>

108
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,130
tend to be more aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like more like</font>

109
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,560
a street style look the Malaysians and

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">in Tunisians are always even if they</font>

111
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get it they love it and they</font>

112
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,490
always they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> open minded people</font>

113
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,720
so they will embrace it if they don't

114
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,790
like it they'll take inspiration they'll

115
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,790
take the good from it and use it for

116
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,990
themselves or just they'll take

117
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,640
inspiration from what they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

118
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,710
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like it they'll just leave</font>

119
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,830
you know as most things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so however there</font>

120
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,970
are others in the world that aren't as

121
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,060
understanding I suppose the Americans

122
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,070
are quite they're quite cool they get it

123
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it they're just</font>

124
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,050
like oh girl you rock you're so just so

125
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,480
