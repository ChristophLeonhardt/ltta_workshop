during the 50th anniversary of the death of Martin Luther King jr. Bernie Sanders gave a speech in Jackson Mississippi and during his speech he specifically talked about the economic injustice is that members of the Democratic Party have been complicit in and while he was mentioning that he happened to mention Obama now that has angered some CNN contributors one specific CNN contributor who we will get to in just a moment but first I wanted you to take a look at Bernie's speech and then we'll discuss charismatic individual named Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008 2012 it was obviously very good but behind over the last about 1000 seats in state legislatures all across this country and unites significant numbers of states like Mississippi where the government the legislature the Senators are all is the democratic elections now following that speech there was one commentator a contributor on CNN by the name of Bakari sellers who tweeted in response to a Bernie had to say and he feels that Bernie's commentary there has completely destroyed his chances in 2020 Sellars tweets y'all can defend Bernie if you want on MLK 50 his lack of self-awareness and arrogance in dismissing number 44 meaning Obama is wild birdie 2020 died on April 4th 2018 luckily that's not an overstatement or anything I'm greatly amused by this yeah so I'm curious as to what your take is on this yeah all right so shocking that a CNN pundit would be Pro establishment against Bernie Sanders my guess is he was ready to declare Bernie Sanders campaign over the day before and would have done it the day after and would do it on almost every single day and they love to bring up racial issues on Bernie Sanders why is Bernie been bad on racial issues not remotely nobody really actually argues that on the substance in fact here let's go to P 3 and B 4 he's the people reason people like Bernie Sanders he's been consistent on all the issues for 40 years that's him in the civil rights era time chaining himself to an african-american woman saying that if you're gonna evict them you're gonna evict me he's been consistent on it for his entire lifetime and then and then they did they arrested him and but no no no no no no we're gonna throw insults at him anyway why because he would bring change and they're not in favor of change so I'm sure that Sellars thinks that he got on CNN because he's awesome and he's just a brilliant pundit and it just the fact that he happens to be against people like Bernie Sanders is a coincidence I Got News for you it's not a coincidence it's not a coincidence that the overwhelming majority of pundits on television or for Hillary Clinton I mean I my guess is Van Jones was for Bernie Sanders he's a real progressive good guy whether he is was or was not for Bernie Sanders I know banjos are real progressive right and Nina Turner sometimes goes on CNN bless her heart and good and that's it we're done okay hey you have to remember CNN was the cable news network that would turn away from anything Bernie Sanders would do to show Trump's empty podium and it was 24 hours seven days a week Trump coverage they gave Trump a tremendous amount tremendous is a fitting word and in this context of Free Press free advertising and unfortunately the attention that he's so desperately wanted and so okay so enough CNN bashing I want to get to the substance of what birdie was saying because I think it's important to actually dissect it and get to the heart of what he meant he didn't say what he said to dismiss Obama or tear Obama apart during this event at all what he was trying to say and what I wish that people on the Left would accept is that many people who originally are initially identified as part of the Democratic Party left the party because they felt abandoned when it came to economic injustice in the country Democrats used to be the party that did look out for the little guy but it has become so incredibly corporatized and and unfortunately you had someone like Obama who was brilliant who was charismatic who did say the right things and campaigned on the right things but even though he did manage to improve the economy somewhat he didn't do enough for a huge portion of the country wages still remain stagnant people are still suffering and I think that it's important to reflect on ourselves as people who identify as part of the left and think about what we can do to improve moving forward I'm not done with sellers of CNN yet okay okay on your point look Bernie didn't even say that he should say that but he didn't say that he said the business model of the Democratic Party in the last 15 years has been failure he said it was you didn't see that much though because Obama was so brilliant and charismatic it covered up their failure that's not an insult of Obama first of all he called it brilliant if you think brilliant is an insult and not sarcastic remotely at all and so I I can't help you because you've got issues of the English language right but second of all I don't agree with Bernie I think that Obama is part of the failure can I say that sellers can I say that right now I know we're past the MLK 50-day so by the way you don't own him so I love Martin Luther King we did segment after segment yesterday about him we do it all the time because he's my hero and and you don't own the opinion of all african-americans Oh Bernie's dead his political career is dead cuz you decided it mister CNN pundit who do you speak for you speak for all Americans but millions of people voted for Bernie Sanders he has I believe in one of the polls that I saw we're good look it up I know that television punters have terrible time with polls when they showed that Bernie Sanders would do better against Hillary Clinton they're like I don't believe my lying eyes all of a sudden fake news you didn't believe in polls right you said no no it can't be true I hate Bernie Sanders it can't be true it can't be true that he has a 12-point lead over Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump it can't be true can't be true that every poll shows that so now no no Bakari sellers decided no Bernie 2020 died he died yesterday because he misinterpreted something that he said about Obama on that particular day so you speak for all African Americans you speak for all Democrats I don't know who annoying to do that except CNN who just happened to hire maybe two people that are for Bernie Sanders in about a hundred and fifty reporters anchors producers that all support Hillary Clinton just a coincidence though just the coincidence look it's not that there is a conspiracy it is that they look for like-minded people and CNN is part of the establishment and they think Hillary is kind of Awesome because the status quo is wonderful what could be wrong with the status quo we're all rich right so they hire like-minded people like sellers who all happen to think Bernie Sanders the minute they interpret his statements as a faux pas he's done he's done look I like Joe Biden I'm not gonna vote for him I'm gonna vote for Bernie Sanders unless something changes right I'm open to facts but but I like Biden but if I said even though I'm I'm probably gonna vote against him on any faux pas oh the thing he said about 7-elevens I said Joe Biden's careers dead Joe Biden's career is dead right that's not how it works and it's preposterous to say because I'm interpreting what he said as against Obama on that particular day his career said because it's not about that it's not like he gets to decide it's great it's this smear 'im as racist that's why you said it yeah otherwise tell me why you said it tell me why you said it that was your implication and it's gross look you do too about Donald Trump it is verifiable I can show you twelve reasons why Donald Trump is absolutely a racist Central Park five and the list goes on and on when a guy's fought for civil rights this whole life to do that to them anyway because you'd like to protect this talisman even if you don't realize that's why you're doing it even if you don't realize that's why you were hired it's still sick you just watch the video by the Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a
