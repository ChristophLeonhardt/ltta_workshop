HE CALLED ME THIS AFTERNOON AND
SAID HE STANDING BY ME.
>> Shannon: ALSO STANDING BY
THE KAVANAUGH OR LESS, LAURA COX
THE KAVANAUGH OR LESS, LAURA COX
KAPLAN, WHO CAMPAIGNED WITH
THEM WITH 75 OTHER WOMEN.
THANK YOU FOR COMING TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW THE KAVANAUGHS WAY
BETTER THAN THE REST OF US.
IT SEEMED TOWARD THE END OF THE
INTERVIEW, HE WAS EMOTIONAL,
SAYING THAT HE WILL STAND BY AND
SAYING THAT HE WILL STAND BY AND
HE SAID IN HIS LETTER, HE OWES
IT TO THE WOMEN LIKE YOU HAVE
GOT TO BAT FOR HIM.
>> THEY ARE A VERY STRONG FAMILY
>> THEY ARE A VERY STRONG FAMILY
BUT THIS HAS BEEN AN
EXCRUCIATING PROCESS.
IT’S VERY PAINFUL.
IT’S A PAINFUL THING FOR YOUR
CHILDREN TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH.
BUT THEY ARE INCREDIBLY STRONG
AND HE IS DEDICATED TO CLEARING
HIS NAME AND HAVING AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY.
I THINK THE CONVERSATION THAT HE
I THINK THE CONVERSATION THAT HE
HAD WITH MARTHA EARLIER TODAY
WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND HAVING AN
WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND HAVING AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY I THINK
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.
>> Shannon: THERE ARE THOSE
WHO, WHEN YOU EXPRESS ANY
EMPATHY FOR HIS FAMILY, THEY
WILL SAY, WHAT ABOUT THESE
ACCUSERS?
WHAT ABOUT THESE WOMEN?
BY THE SYMPATHY OR EMPATHY FOR
THE KAVANAUGHS AND NOT THE
WOMEN?
>> TO BE CLEAR, I DO HAVE GREAT
EMPATHY FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN
EMPATHY FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN
THE VICTIM OF ASSAULTS.
IT’S A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING.
IT’S A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING.
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, I HAVE
KNOWN BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR ALMOST
KNOWN BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR ALMOST
20 YEARS.
HE IS A GOOD, MORAL PERSON.
HE’S AN UPSTANDING PERSON, A
PERSON OF INCREDIBLY HIGH
INTEGRITY.
HE HAS A SPOTLESS RECORD.
IF THESE ALLEGATIONS DO NOT
DRIVE WITH THE PERSON THAT I
KNOW WITH THE MORE THAN 100
WOMEN WHO HAVE SIGNED LETTERS,
SPOKEN OUT PUBLICLY, WHO KNOW
HIM PERSONALLY.
SIMPLY, YOU CAN’T RECONCILE
THESE BEHAVIORS WITH THE PERSON
THAT WE KNOW.
WITH THIS INCREDIBLE FATHER AT
THIS INCREDIBLE HUSBAND AND THIS
THIS INCREDIBLE HUSBAND AND THIS
INCREDIBLE FRIEND.
HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU
AND OTHERS FOR ALL OF US, THIS
IS CHALLENGING.
PEOPLE COME AFTER US FOR
DEFENDING OUR FRIEND, BRETT.
BUT HE WOULD DO THE SAME THING
FOR US.
HE HAS THAT KIND OF PERSON.
I THINK IT SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY OF
I THINK IT SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY OF
HIS CHARACTER.
>> Shannon: I WILL PLAY
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR JOE
MANCHIN, A DEMOCRAT, ONE OF
THOSE UNDER GREAT PRESSURE WHEN
IT COMES TO THIS, HERE’S WHAT HE
IT COMES TO THIS, HERE’S WHAT HE
SAID ABOUT ALL SIDES OF THIS.
>> WHOEVER OR HOWEVER MANY, THEY
>> WHOEVER OR HOWEVER MANY, THEY
ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK AND WE
ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK AND WE
LOOK FORWARD TO THAT AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE.
HE ALSO HAS A RIGHT TO CLEAR HIS
HE ALSO HAS A RIGHT TO CLEAR HIS
NAME.
HE TRULY DOES.
THAT IS WHAT I AM HOPING FOR.
WE CAN GET TO IT AS QUICKLY AS
WE CAN THIS WEEK OR WHATEVER HE
TAKES.
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK YOU
WILL GET A FAIR SHAKE?
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DEMOCRATIC
SENATORS IS SAYING THAT THEY
BELIEVE HER AND HE IS GUILTY,
WITHOUT HEARING FROM BOTH OF
THEM UNDER OATH.
>> IT’S UNFORTUNATE THAT FOLKS
ARE MOVING SO QUICKLY TO THAT
AND NOT GIVING BOTH SIDES AN
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.
HE DOES DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE
HEARD.
ACCUSERS, I BELIEVE, DESERVE THE
ACCUSERS, I BELIEVE, DESERVE THE
RIGHT TO BE HEARD.
I AM TROUBLED BY THE LACK OF DUE

ALLEGATION, NO MATTER HOW
OUTLANDISH IT MAY BE, AND WITHOY

I AM TROUBLED BY THAT.
I AM TROUBLED BY WHAT THIS MEANS
I AM TROUBLED BY WHAT THIS MEANS
FOR, NOT ONLY THIS PROCESS,
WHERE JUDGE KAVANAUGH’S CONCERN,

YOU AND I WERE TALKING EARLIER,
WHO WOULD SUGGEST THEMSELVES IN
A PROCESS IN WHICH ANYONE CAN
LAW BETTY ACCUSATION AT ANY TIME
LAW BETTY ACCUSATION AT ANY TIME
WITHOUT ANY MERIT OR
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE?
THAT’S VERY TROUBLESOME.
AS THE MOTHER OF BOTH A SON AND
DAUGHTER, IT IS ESPECIALLY
TROUBLING.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE
FUTURE, FOR THEM?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR MEN IN THE

FUTURE?
