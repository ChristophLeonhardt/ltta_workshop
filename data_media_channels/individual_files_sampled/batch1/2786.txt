the most beautiful word to a heterosexual man's ears on a first date is the word I said Stephen spirits writer for the New York Times former Google data scientist and I'm the author of the book everybody lies we used to think of data as surveys very structured answers right a checkbox yes/no or a number you put in 101 1 2 2 1 2 3 whatever and now data is kind of the wild unstructured world on the internet and one of the big types of data is text scientists follow daters around on speed dates and they had recorders with them and then at the end of the day they said whether they wanted to go on a second date so the scientists could measure what words used on a first date suggest that people are going to want a second date a man can increase his odds of getting a second date if he shows support if he says things like that must be tough or you know that sounds hard he can also increase the odds of the second date if he laughs at a woman's joke at jokes and doesn't interrupt her constantly which probably isn't rocket science the most beautiful word to a heterosexual man's ears on a first date is the word I when a woman talks about herself more it's actually a sign that she likes them she feels comfortable opening up and actually a woman I think frequently think that they should not talk too much about themselves but that's also wrong in the data men like women talking opening up telling stories about their own lives they're more likely to like the woman and agree to a second date
