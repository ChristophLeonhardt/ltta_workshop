it's one of the most dangerous jobs for an Iraqi soldier identifying and defusing unexploded mortars homemade bombs and other explosives the streets of Mosul's old city are littered with such weapons most of which are buried under houses and buildings destroyed by mortar artillery and air strikes the sound of explosions regularly brings out as teams detonate the bombs we are working hard to dismantle these unexploded bombs yet many of the displaced who are trying to return home have found explosives in their houses all their houses were rigged with explosives or the neighbor's houses rigged instead so when they report this to us we have to take action on the outskirts of Mosul which is in Iraq spree dominantly soon need Nineveh province some of the unexploded devices are brought here to be destroyed Iraqi officials estimate more than 5,000 civilians were killed in the battle for the city most of them in US and Iraqi air strikes artillery and mortar attacks targeting ISIL fighters with no escape route out of Mosul several hundred thousand civilians were trapped as security forces seized control of the city at a recent meeting Iraqi military leaders promised Nineveh provincial council officials they would remove the unexploded ordnance as quickly as possible so that those displaced in the fighting could return home we have agreed to implement a roadmap to prioritize our mission to remove explosive devices as soon as possible from the city the purpose of removing this explosive is to comply with the orders of the prime minister we want to facilitate the return of displaced people and bring back stability across liberated areas according to the United Nations most of the explosives are buried under an estimated 11 metric tons of rubble un experts say removing the devices will likely take many years the US government has promised to provide loans and loan guarantees to American companies to help reconstruct Mosul but won't provide any direct funding for the 88 billion dollars Iraq says it needs to rebuild the city and others like it meaning it will likely take a long time for any form of normalcy to return here in Thea's dive al Jazeera
