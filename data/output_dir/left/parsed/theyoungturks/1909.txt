COMPTON RAPPER KENDRICK LAMAR
HAS WON A PULITZER PRIZE FOR HIS
ALBUM DAMN!
IT IS VERY GOOD.
I WAS A PHENOMENAL ALBUM.
HE HAS MADE HISTORY BY
WINNING THIS PULITZER.
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.
>> I'M GOING TO JUMP IN HERE.
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT KENDRICK
LAMAR BECAUSE I STOP LISTENING
TO THE RADIO ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.
BUT YOU GUYS ALL LOVE HIM AND
I'M SURE HE'S FANTASTIC.
THE IDEAS HE TALKS ABOUT IS MORE
IMPORTANT AND IS REALLY
INTERESTING.
I LOVE HOW THEY ARE LIKE WE'RE
GOING TO GET CRAZY HERE AND
OPEN UP TO JAZZ.
AND PULITZER
FOLKS ARE GREAT PEOPLE BUT THE
IDEA THAT THE ONLY GOOD ART IS
DEAD ART, BUT THEY CALL IT
CULTURE, OPERA, BALLET
WHATEVER.
I CAN'T STAND THAT.
THOSE ARE ANCIENT FORMS OF ART.
>>
I LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC AS WELL.
>> THAT IS FINE BUT IT IS DEAD.
>>YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE
CRAZY RIGHT NOW.
YOU ONLY SEE THROUGH
YOUR NARROW LENS.
>> IT IS NOT NARROW.
EVERYBODY ELSE'S NARROW.
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS FUNNY.
SHAKESPEARE AND OPERA BACK IN
THE DAY WERE POP-CULTURE.
IT WAS LIKE A MOVIE AND HE WAS
REALLY GOOD AT IT.
I KNOW I AM A BAD GUY.
BOTTOM LINE, THANK YOU PULITZER
FOR OPENING YOUR VISION A LITTLE
FURTHER AND SEEING THAT
POP-CULTURE DOES IT MATTER.
MATTERS TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
THAT LISTEN TO KENDRICK LAMAR
AND ARE INFLUENCED BY HIM.
>> THE REASON WHY I AM VERY
HAPPY ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE A
LOT OF TIMES RAPPERS GET
PORTRAYED IN ONE STEREOTYPICAL
WAY.
THEY ARE WRAPPING ABOUT THEIR
MONEY, WOMEN IN A DISRESPECTFUL
WAY, AND THAT IS IT.
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY RAPPERS
OUT THERE WHO ACTUALLY GIVE
YOU AN EDUCATION ABOUT WHAT
THEIR COMMUNITIES GO THROUGH.
I THINK KENDRICK DOES A REALLY
GREAT JOB OF THAT.
J COLE DOES A GREAT JOB OF THAT.
THERE'S THIS ONE SONG CALLED
NEIGHBORS BY J COLE, THE LYRICS
OF THAT SONG REALLY GET TO THE
HEART OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT
HAS DONE CERTAIN PEOPLE WRONG.
HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW HIS
NEIGHBORS THINK HE IS SELLING
DOPE, AND I JUST LOVE THAT
BECAUSE HE IS A RICH BLACK GUY,
HE BUYS THIS BEAUTIFUL BIG HOME
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE
NEIGHBORS PROBABLY THINK HE
IS SELLING DOPE.
IT JUST TOUCHES ON SOMETHING
THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
GO THROUGH.
>> I GREW UP LISTENING TO
PUBLIC ENEMY.
IT IS POP-CULTURE.
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU HAVE
NEVER LIVED THAT LIFE, HE GIVES
YOU A WINDOW INTO THAT LIFE AND
THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING.
YOU MIGHT LEARN A THING OR TWO.
INSTEAD I WILL GIVE YOU A
PULITZER COMMITTEE QUOTE.
THIS IS ABOUT KENDRICK LAMAR.
WELL INDEED IT DOES.
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD PHRASE IT
THAT WAY BUT I ENJOYED THE
PULITZER PRIZE FREEZING
IT 
THAT WAY.
>> THAT 
IS THE REASON WHY IT
MAKES YOU THINK OF CLASSICAL
MUSIC AND BALLET.
