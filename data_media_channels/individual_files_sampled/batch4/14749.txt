in the past there were a few things that we could all agree on the sky is blue socialism doesn't work and diehard is the greatest movie ever made however the left in recent years has abandoned objective truth for subjective narcissistic selfish screeching of I feel so I should get and nothing I've seen shows this more clearly than the reviews for death wish starring Bruce Willis a movie so manly so in line with actual conflict so action-packed so perfect in its toxic masculinity that it literally combines ac/dc Milton Friedman home defense with salt rifles and condemned Chicago for not being able to protected citizens oh my god I can just see every leftist just cringing watching this movie I've been dazed it's pure Hollywood death which was directed by Eli Roth was made for about thirty million dollars and opened up with 13 million Plus which is great for the first opening weekend and this was a remake to the 1974 cult classic well let's compare some reviews from the 1974 movie where there used to be some semblance of diversity and criticism the reviews were 65% by critics and 68 by the public which is about in agreement and now it is a shocking 15 percent of critics liked the movie and 85 percent of viewers enjoyed it let's see why as a movie I'm gonna give this a 4 out of 5 this film has everything you would want as a movie goer if you're right of Bernie Sanders without going into too much detail you follow Bruce Willis as he goes on a complete journey of being a very passive and respectful person to being heartbroken and going after the people that ruined his life this happens because a law-abiding citizen has his life ripped apart when a home invasion gone wrong takes the life of his wife and puts his daughter in a coma now here's what separates this movie from other revenge flicks another revenge flicks the whole world the whole movie set up it's just geared around one person and if the whole world is one person whatever you're experiencing is it it's absolute but this movie takes a step back and lets society ask questions of is this justified is it right for you to go out of your way to take down killers drug dealers and rapists and in doing so it allows the audience to not just be a spectator but to also be involved in the movie it's pretty fun my critic review is a four out of five what I love most about this movie as a critic as far as production is it didn't search you directly into the time right now one of the opening sequences of the movie shows Chicago as you know one of the most crime-ridden cities in the entire United States that has also been a democratic leftist hellhole for a long time with some of the harshest gun regulations in the entire country and you see police officers so in over their head that some died in the opening scene and you have different commentators like actual commentators and the news they've talked about oh my gosh it's rampant here like 40 people killed in one weekend all these shots and just start talking about how bad it is and how nothing has helped so far and you can see all the left and start to cringe as all their policies are being called out and you can clearly see on the screen the result of them and in fear it's shocking for them to come that bad people will do bad things and the police can't always help you shocker and one of the most impressive parts of this movie directing and writing wise is you get to see these snapshots and these different scenes of how someone's world when they're flipped upside down this would be the natural response when you realize that self-preservation is your only way to protect your family and you from these outside horrific forces and in one of my favorite scenes which would just drive people crazy our hero literally goes to Texas to go get some advice when older man is hurt his wife's father who's there and he pulls over the side of the road and starts shooting at these poachers they're poaching his fields and killing this animal and usually firing off these guys then running away and then he gives this great kind of speech and talking wisdom about how a man is it's your job as that of the household to protect your family and if you can't do that then you failed now our hero goes home and decides I don't need a gun because he sees some goofy commercial with some blonde bimbo talking about how you need an assault rifle to protect your home he thinks that's stupid who then on his way home sees a woman being attacked by two gangbangers and apparently her lessons at the YMCA taking Krav Maga weren't enough to hold these guys off which of course in real life would obviously not work either however he steps in and takes an unbelievable beating because obviously there's nothing he could do either because he has no way to protect himself everything this meticulous surgeon does buy a gun to defend himself and others and inflicts righteous judgment on those who deserve it and NASA is one of the best shooting death scenes I've ever seen when you see the ice cream man scene it is awesome it's absolutely awesome to watch however these actions do leave him depress and unable to sleep this also sparks a controversy of is this the right thing to do is this man worse than the people that he's killing or is this righteous judgement as it starts this massive debate and this sparks up because this is done outside the realm of self-defense and self-preservation which is your god-given right and protected by the US Constitution for now my faith in values is a three out of five now there are no overt Christian messages in this movie in fact there is a funeral scene where a man questions God's sovereignty in these situations and is there actually a plan also there's multiple scenes of Bruce Willis where he's asked to have faith and let the police do their thing and he doesn't however it is important to note that the Bible does not just call us to sit back in our recliner knowing that the Lord will just take care of whatever we in fact the Bible specifically tells people not to just test the Lord and James 4:17 says so whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it for him it is sin this movie also brilliantly shows the deep desire to protect those who we love and lay down our lives for them now should you take the stance of going around like this guy because you see bad people doing bad things and take them out of course not we are a nation of laws and we are called to obey the rules and laws and regulations of them however we also do have the right to self-preservation given to us by the Second Amendment here in the United States and have every right to absolutely obliterate any psychopath and enters our home to do us or loved-ones harm honestly this is just a fun entertaining ride of a movie and you should definitely go see this before the left bans it because it's basically a two-hour stance against everything that the left thinks works I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel up and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive content and the entire rebel lineup you
