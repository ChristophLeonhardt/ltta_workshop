opposition activist Alexei Navalny is bid for the Russian presidency has hit a stumbling block his candidacy has been rejected by the Central Electoral Commission I discussed this earlier with rtz caused enough ego it's been a bit of an ongoing story has and the people uncertain whether he would be allowed to run whether he wouldn't be I mean what was the stated reason for the rejection officially well done the irony of this whole story is Alexei Navalny has been basking in the love of Western politicians in Western media outlets but really today's decision shouldn't have come as a surprise to anybody in fact it should have been seen from miles and miles and miles away because there's a federal law in Russia that unequivocally prohibits and I quote a citizen of the Russian Federation shall not be entitled to be elected if they have a conviction of a grave crime and this is exactly what Alexei Navalny has he has been found guilty of embezzlement earlier this year when he was serving as an advisor to one of the russian governors he's in he's in fact still serving a five-year suspended sentence he is calling this verdict this ruling politically motivated and that it was designed specifically to prevent him from running in the election I mean what's next for Alexei Navalny he's he's saying people have to boycott the election but I mean it's likely he's gonna continue he's his opposition activities isn't it well yeah talking about a plan B doesn't really of course some analysts suggest that he does have a legal option he can battle the court ruling at the Constitutional Court of Russia but really so far he has only been calling to boycott the election altogether have a listen it's ready we're declaring a vote is strike we're calling on everyone to boycott this election we will not accept its result we're launching a large-scale national strike campaign which will not only include campaigning against the election but also monitoring voter turnout I mean Navarre was viewed by many is sort of the only if you like real opposition candidate to Putin this is true if you read British and American media outlets because take Sunday this it was the day when Alexei Navalny filed in his documents to the Election Committee there were dozens literally dozens of people who did the same thing on that day look at the headlines they're all screaming Valley is going to be the Putin's nemesis at the election not a mention of anybody other there if you look at the public support of the Opposition over the weekend hundreds of people gathered and protested in an opposition back action in in favor of what they call fair election but he who you compare that to say 2011 there were hand there were tens of thousands of people who backed the very same cause and I mean Alexei Navalny he's of course among the bigger fish in the pond but his rating right now stands at 1.8% a figure he would certainly like to change if he ever gets on the ballot
