the sausage patty is just just it's not supposed to do that right yeah the eggs and the cheese and the sausage just looked kind of fake and plasticky I want to eat this yeah it's pretty good so this biscuit has a really nice consistency the biscuit is fluffy and soft and tasty the egg tastes sort of gelatin like the sausage patty is just just it's not supposed to do that right it's pretty good though this definitely looks a lot better than the other one it just feels more natural I guess this looks sad this is way better than sandwich one this is fairly flavorless not really feeling it I mean this gets really really good get this out of my face okay this one looks very nice a lot of that oh yeah when I touch this egg it makes this sound listen to this it looks like an omelet that's been folded over with nothing inside so I feel like it was somewhat fresh you're getting that Noah oh yeah so this is a really big proportion of egg and biscuit so much biscuit just doesn't taste that good it really drowns out any kind of sausage or cheese flavor no this was delicious this one looks really good because the egg looks like an actual egg see that that's yolk and look at this sausage this looks like a real piece of sausage and then you walked me so that wasn't as good as I haven't thought it was gonna be yeah no so there's a huge difference here when you actually try the egg because it is seems to be a fried egg and it tastes just so much better it doesn't taste like anything it just tastes like plastic it really let me down huh which one was my favorite which one seemed like my favorite so sandwich two was the best wasn't you are really close to just barely beat one yeah I know where two was my favorite my favorite sandwich was number three hands-down my favorite one was the last one that I tried number one was the best for sure oh are you houghton are you kidding me really Burger King holy I hate Burger King
