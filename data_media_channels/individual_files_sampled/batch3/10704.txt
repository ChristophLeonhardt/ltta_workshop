senior US officials say president Trump is going to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel he's also set to kick-start the process of moving the American Embassy to the city from Tel Aviv the White House says the decisions which are expected to be announced at some stage on Wednesday will be in America's best interests I'm not going to get ahead of the president's remarks that he'll make tomorrow he did speak with a number of leaders this morning and he's going to continue to have conversations with relevant stakeholders but ultimately he'll make what he feels is the best decision for the United States well Jerusalem which is considered holy by Christians Muslims and Jews is not recognized as the Israeli capital by most of the international community that's despite the country's government being based there and it blaming the ancient city as its capital Trump's announcement when made will be a landmark decision and will likely inflame tension in the Middle East limiters have already emerged in fact of several and then burning pictures of Trump in Bethlehem the EU s diplomatic chief has also responded she says the initiative needs to be discussed with the Palestinians who also claim Jerusalem as their capital a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states so that the aspiration of both parties can be fulfilled Donald Trump is once again at the center of controversy he is now talking about moving the u.s. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem president of the Palestinian Authority has already denounced the move saying that it could have dangerous consequences for the peace process we've also heard from Hamas which has talked about the possibility that they would revive the Intifada long-standing US allies in the region such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia have also criticized the move Turkey has even talked about the possibility of cutting off diplomatic ties with Israel the US State Department has sent out a cable warning people at American embassies or the country about the hotend need for heightened security furthermore we've also heard that the US consulate that is already in Jerusalem is at this point warning US citizens living in the city this seems like a dramatic move and it seems to fly in the face of an earlier statement that we heard from Donald Trump let's take a listen to what he said so I'm looking at two state and one state and I like the one that both parties like I'm very happy with the one that both parties like one party the Palestinians and their allies is already deeply offended and there's possibility of retaliation and if that retaliation materializes then the other party could also be suffering it seems that there's indeed many people that are far from happy with this decision from the White House caleb Maupin RT New York Donald Trump has said in the past he believes he has a good shot at bringing peace to the region but journalist mark Bruce on Skee told us he doesn't think that's really on the President's agenda the bigger picture is not a peace process that doesn't even really exist nobody really expects that to happen what's really happening is the region is being flooded with arms Trump laughs when he talks about the tens of billions that were selling around the world not only in the Middle East but now in Asia let's not take Trump at his word this is a tremendous mistake and it's even a waste of time the real policies are Trump needs to keep himself in office and needs to pretend that he's president and that different constituency should not oppose him
