OTHER GEORGE W. BUSH AND FOX
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.
KARL, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
THANKS FOR COMING IN.
THE PRIMARIES HAVE BEEN ROLLING
HERE, MANY STATES NOW.
WHAT'S THE BIG TAKE AWAY FROM
YOUR POINT OF VIEW?
>> WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
GENERIC BALLOT JUST BEFORE
CHRISTMAS, BEFORE THEY PASSED
THE TAX CUT, THE DEMOCRATIC
MARGIN WAS 13 POINTS, BY MID
FEBRUARY IT WAS DOWN TO 9, BY
LATE MARCH DOWN TO 7 AND AS YOU
SAY MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND WE FIND
OURSELVES WITH 4 POINT ADVANTAGE
FOR THE DEMOCRATS.
THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
DURING THAT TIME, I THINK THREE
THINGS ARE AT PLAY HERE, ONE IS
IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRESIDENT'S
JOB APPROVAL, IT'S GONE FROM
BEING IN THE HIGH 30's TO THE
LOW 40's, THAT MAYBE 4-5 POINT
INCREASE MAY SOUND SMALL BUT
CRITICAL TO THE REPUBLICANS AND
42, 43, 44% RANGE.
SECOND OF ALL, THE ECONOMY,
PERCENTAGES OF THE ECONOMY ARE
IMPROVING WHETHER DIRECTLY FOR
TAX CUT OR NOT, WE CAN ARGUE ALL
DAY LONG BUT THE FACT OF THE
MATTER IS THE WAY PEOPLE --
PAUL: PEOPLE FEEL BETTER.
>> DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO
PRIMARIES AND ARE STARTING TO
SEE WHO THE DEMOCRATS ARE
PUTTING UP AND I'M NOT CERTAIN
THAT'S NECESSARILY HELPING THE
DEMOCRATS IN EACH AND EVERY
CASE.
PAUL: YOU SAY THAT I'VE SEEN THE
RACE IN NEBRASKA, TEXAS,
PENNSYLVANIA, THE LEFT SIDE OF
THE PARTY IS WINNING IN
DISTRICTS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE
DISTRICTS WHERE THAT KIND OF
MESSAGE MAY NOT PLAY AS WELL AS
CENTRIST VOICE, IS THAT YOUR
POINT?
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S TWO
THINGS.
ONE, THEY ARE NOMINATING SOME
LEFT-LEANING CANDIDATES LIKE IN
NEBRASKA AND PENNSYLVANIA, ONE,
BUT EVEN WHEN THE CANDIDATES
HAVE ENTERED THE RACE NOT AS
LEFT-WING CANDIDATE, THE
RHETORIC THAT THEY FEEL COMPEL
TODAY ADOPT IN DEMOCRATIC
PRIMARY PLACES THEM TO THE LEFT
OF WHERE THEY NEED TO BE,
REMEMBER, IN ORDER TO TWIN
HOUSE, THE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE
TO WIN DISTRICTS THAT ARE AT
INSTANCES RED.
PAUL: OKAY, HERE IS THE THING,
THOUGH, THE BUGGY NERRIC BALLOT,
THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S
TIGHTENING.
THE MARGIN FOR HOLDING THE HOUSE
ACCORDING TO KEVIN MCCARTHY, THE
MAJORITY LEADER IS 6, WITHIN 6
THE REPUBLICANS THINK THEY CAN
HOLD THE HOUSE BUT THIS DOESN'T
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION,
DEMOCRATIC VOTER ENTHUSIASM.
I'VE TALKED TO REPUBLICANS IN
SOME OF THE SPECIAL RACES, ED
GALLESPIE TOLD ME THE DEMOCRATIC
DIDN'T TURN OUT ENTIRELY IN THE
DATA ON ELECTION DAY BECAUSE
DEMOCRATS ARE SO FIRED UP THAT
THEY EXCEED THE POLLING, WHAT DO
YOU THINK OF THAT?
>> I THINK THAT'S ACCURATE BUT A
LONG TIME BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2017
VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE AND THE
NOVEMBER 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS
AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR
CONFLICTING INFORMATION.
WE'VE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF -- OF
MEDIA COMMENTARY THAT POINTED
TOWARDS BIG TURNOUT BY DEMOCRATS
IN TEXAS EVEN SUGGESTING THAT
THEY MIGHT ECLIPSE THE
REPUBLICANS, WELL, HALF MANY
PEOPLE VOTED IN REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY AND THE RUNOFF IS THE
LOWEST IN HISTORY AND OHIO
REPUBLICANS OUTVOTED THE
DEMOCRATS BOTH PARTIES HAD
COMPETITIVE PRIMARIES FOR
GOVERNOR, THE REPUBLICANS FAR
OUTVOTED THE DEMOCRATS.
SO, AGAIN, IT'S HARD TO SAY, I
WOULD SAY THAT ENTHUSIASM IS ON
THE SIDE OF THE DEMOCRATS BUT
WHETHER THAT'S SUFFICIENT
ENOUGH, WE DON'T KNOW, WE HAVE
AN ETERNITY TO GO BETWEEN NOW
AND NOVEMBER AND ALL KINDS OF
THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO EFFECT
VOTER ENTHUSIASM IN EACH PARTY'S
LIKELIHOOD OF TURNING OUT.
PAUL: SEEMS TO ME SOMETHING ELSE
THE HAPPENING AND THAT IS THAT
THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE FOCUSED
ON ROBERT MUELLER, ROBERT
MUELLER, DONALD TRUMP AND NOW
TALKING IMPEACHMENT ARE BEGIN TO
GO SHIFT, MAYBE IMPEACHMENT IS
RUNNING REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM.
DEMOCRATS ARE TURNING TO HEALTH
CARE, RISING COSTS, RISING
PREMIUMS AND GASOLINE PRICES
WHICH WE KNOW HAVE GONE UP FOR A
VARIETY OF REASONS AS THE SUMMER
DRIVING SEASON INCREASES.
ARE THOSE TWO REPUBLICAN
VULNERABILITIES?
>> THEY ARE.
YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON A REALLY
INTERESTING POINT WHICH IS THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM
IMPEACHMENT.
I THINK IT'S FOR TWO REASONS,
ONE IT OBSCURES CHANCE TO TALK
ABOUT BROADER ISSUES AND SECOND
OF ALL, REMEMBER, IN ORDER TO
WIN THESE DISTRICTS, IN THESE
STATES, MANY INSTANCES THEY WILL
HAVE TO WIN SWING INDEPENDENT
VOTERS AND IT'S INTERESTING,
VETERANS ARE STRONG IN FAVOR OF
IMPEACHMENT, REPUBLICANS
STRONGLY OPPOSE TO IT AND
INDEPENDENTS TEND TO LOOK MORE
LIKE THE REPUBLICANS THAN THEY
DO DEMOCRATS.
PAUL: IF YOU WERE LAYING A
DEMOCRATIC HAT, YOU WOULD SAY
LAY OFF IMPEACHMENT?
>> OH, YEAH, THE VOICES HAVE
BEEN RIGHT ON.
WHETHER OR NOT EVERY CANDIDATE
IS GOING TO LISTEN TO HIM IS
ANOTHER THING AND DURING THE
PRIMARIES RHETORIC, EVEN IF THEY
HAVE NOT COME OUT AND ENDORSED
RESISTANCE BY CALLING
IMPEACHMENT, CANDIDATES WHO HAVE
BEEN MODERATE OR CENTRIST IN
VIEWS HAVE ADOPTED RHETORIC
WHICH MAKES THEM SOUND OFF
RESISTANCE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN DALLAS,
DEMOCRATS TALKED ABOUT HOW TRUMP
WILL TAKE US INTO A WORLD THAT
WILL DESTROY THE WORLD AND IT'S
COMMON SENSE VERSUS QUOTE
IDIOCY, THE LANGUAGE EVEN IF
THEY DON'T ENDORSE, PART TO HAVE
RESISTANCE.
