00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:01,740
COMING UP.

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:07,146
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

3
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:09,748
LEE DEFENDERS ARE CALLING FOR A

4
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:10,950
TOUGH RESPONSE BY AMERICA, THE

5
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:12,518
CROWN PRINCE IS FOUND TO BE

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,387
CONNECTED TO THE MURDER.

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:17,523
REPORTS ARE THAT THERE IS A

8
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:18,290
WEDGE BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP IN

9
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,792
THE G.O.P.

10
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:22,094
IT'S BRINGING LINDSEY GRAHAM,

11
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:23,195
SENATOR OF THE ARMED SERVICE

12
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:25,130
COMMITTEE.

13
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:26,131
WELCOME.

14
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:27,199
YOU'VE TALKED PRETTY TOUGH ABOUT

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,367
THIS.

16
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:29,068
THEY ARE A LOT OF FACT-FINDING

17
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:30,202
TO DO.

18
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:32,872
WHAT IS YOUR GUT TELL YOU?

19
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:35,774
WE KNOW WHAT SOME OF YOUR FELLOW

20
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:36,208
LAWMAKERS HAD?

21
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:38,544
>> THE CROWNED PRINCE IS 33

22
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:38,944
YEARS OLD.

23
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,746
THERE IS A REASON YOU CAN'T RUN

24
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:43,582
TO PRESIDENT UNTIL YOU ARE 35.

25
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,817
>> Shannon: IN THIS COUNTRY.

26
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:47,186
>> HE HAS BEEN A BREAKING BALL.

27
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:48,754
HE PUT THE PRIME MINISTER OF

28
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:52,391
LEBANON UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

29
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:53,759
ONE MINUTE HE IS A VISIONARY

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,660
LEADER IN THE NEXT MINUTE HE IS

31
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:58,497
PUTTING WOMEN IN JAIL WHO

32
00:00:58,498 --> 00:00:58,831
PROTEST.

33
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:04,703
THE MAN KILLED IN TURKEY.

34
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:06,572
>> Shannon: ARE YOU CONVINCED

35
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:07,139
THAT HE WAS MURDERED?

36
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,342
>> ABSOLUTELY.

37
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:11,544
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEAT

38
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,244
SHERLOCK HOLMES, HE GOES INTO

39
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:13,946
THE CONSULATE AND NEVER COMES

40
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:16,382
OUT.

41
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:17,349
HE WAS ANNOYED WITH THIS GUY.

42
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,585
THEY LURED HIM.

43
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:20,986
WHERE DID THESE 15 PEOPLE COME

44
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:24,924
FROM THAT LANDED IN TURKEY?

45
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:28,260
SOMEBODY IS AN AUTOPSY EXPERT,

46
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,762
WHAT DOES THAT AT THE DO WITH

47
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:30,129
IT?

48
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,598
I WOULD NOT HAVE MY INTELLIGENCE

49
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,365
CONSULTED OR MINOR SUPPORT

50
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,000
DISRESPECTED.

51
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,802
I WAS A LEADING ADVOCATE FOR

52
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:38,837
SAUDI ARABIA, THEIR STRATEGIC

53
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:39,138
ALLY.

54
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:42,875
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN

55
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:44,443
TREMENDOUS TO THE COUNTRY OF

56
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:44,877
SAUDI ARABIA.

57
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:47,580
THIS IS THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL

58
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,415
THING I'VE EVER SEEN TOWARDS THE

59
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,149
PRESIDENT.

60
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,151
HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE COULD

61
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:53,586
TO HELP SAUDI ARABIA AND THIS IS

62
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:54,787
THE WAY YOU ARE REPAYING HIM?

63
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:56,789
HE IS A STRONG MAN.

64
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,190
THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED.

65
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,959
>> Shannon: WANT TO PLAY

66
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,726
SOMETHING THAT MARCO RUBIO'S HAD

67
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:05,598
SOMETHING TO US LAST NIGHT.

68
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,599
SPEAK OF THE BIGGER ISSUE HERE

69
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
BECOMES THE ROLE THEY PLAY IN

70
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,703
OUR MIDDLE EASTERN STRATEGY.

71
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:14,340
WISELY, THEY HAD BUILT THEM AS A

72
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,041
KEY ALLY AGAINST IRAN AND THEIR

73
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,576
AMBITIONS AND THEIR EXPANSION IN

74
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:18,410
THE REGION.

75
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,546
THAT IS ENDANGERED NOW.

76
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:21,547
IT MAKES US IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO

77
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:25,918
WORK WITH THEM CLOSELY.

78
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,186
>> Shannon: ALL KIND OF

79
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,354
INTERCONNECTIONS, ON OIL ON

80
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:29,021
THEIR MILITARY MEETING US TO

81
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:31,991
HELP SUSTAIN THEM ON THE ISSUES

82
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:34,226
WITH IRAN.

83
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:36,161
YEMEN, WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?

84
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:37,029
>> WHAT WE NEED THE MOST IS TO

85
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,766
BE GOOD AMERICANS.

86
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,134
THESE ARE ALLIES.

87
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:43,335
THIS SHOWS TREMENDOUS DISRESPECT

88
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:44,370
FOR ME AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.

89
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,505
TO PUT US IN THIS BOX.

90
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:51,477
YOU CAN TAKE CRITICISM AT ALL,

91
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:52,978
TO SEND AN ASSASSINATION SQUAD

92
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,680
TO TURKEY TO KILL A MAN ON

93
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:56,982
FOREIGN SOIL IN A CONSULATE AND

94
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:58,951
TURKEY VIOLATES EVERY NORM KNOWN

95
00:02:58,952 --> 00:02:59,351
TO MANKIND.

96
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:03,956
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, THIS ALL

97
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:05,758
ORIGINATED FROM THE CROWN

98
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,925
PRINCE, I'M CONVINCED OF THAT.

99
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:07,760
THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO BE

100
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:10,562
MEASURED, I GET THAT.

101
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:12,164
THE WORLD IS WATCHING US.

102
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:15,134
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO JOIN IRAN

103
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:15,801
AND SAUDI ARABIA.

104
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:16,935
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN

105
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:17,703
SAUDI ARABIA THAT WE COULD HAVE

106
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:21,140
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH.

107
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:22,374
IF THE CROWNED PRINCE STAYS IN

108
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,576
POWER IT WILL BE ALMOST

109
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:25,544
IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT THIS

110
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:27,680
RELATIONSHIP AT A TIME WHEN BOTH

111
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:28,580
OF US NEED IT.

112
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:30,983
>> Shannon: THE INVESTIGATION

113
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:32,384
CONTINUES.

114
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:33,385
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH AND

115
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:34,153
SEE IF WE GET NEW INFORMATION.

116
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:37,423
I WANT TO GET YOU TO RESPOND TO

117
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,590
SOMETHING.

118
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,792
HERE'S SOMETHING YOU SAID

119
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:41,060
EARLIER TODAY AND TALKING ABOUT

120
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:45,364
TAKING A DNA TEST.

121
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:48,100
>> COME BACK AND A COUPLE OF

122
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:53,906
WEEKS.

123
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:56,975
OKAY, YOU MEAN THE LEADER IS NOT

124
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:57,409
THE PEOPLE.

125
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,780
THAT OFFENDED A LOT OF FOLKS.

126
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,482
JAMAAL OPTI SAID THIS, IF YOU

127
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:05,350
DREAD THE NOTION OF A RAINY AND

128
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,952
ANCESTRY AND BELIEVE THEY ARE

129
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:08,387
ALL LIARS YOU ARE HOPELESSLY

130
00:04:08,388 --> 00:04:10,422
BIGOTED AND UNFIT TO SERVE IN

131
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:14,359
THE U.S. SENATE.

132
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,562
>> IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

133
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:17,863
ME, NAME ONE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN

134
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,398
A BIGGER DEFENDER OF THE IRANIAN

135
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,466
PEOPLE TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST

136
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:21,867
THEIR PRESS.

137
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:25,304
IT WAS A JOKE.

138
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:28,774
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE ARE BRAVE AND

139
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:29,108
CULTURE.

140
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,776
TO MY LIBERAL FRIENDS WERE

141
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:31,977
OFFENDED BY MY STATEMENT, AT

142
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:33,545
LEAST I DIDN'T VOTE FOR AN

143
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:36,582
AGREEMENT TO GIVE $150 BILLION

144
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,083
TO THE MAN WHO KILLS IRANIANS

145
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,753
AND THE STREET THEIR DEMANDING

146
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:41,420
FREEDOM AND A FAIR ELECTION.

147
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:42,755
I HAVE STOOD WITH THE IRANIAN

148
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:43,188
PEOPLE.

149
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:45,357
I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.

150
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:48,127
I HAVE NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT FOR

151
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:48,694
THE MURDEROUS REGIME.

152
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:53,932
IT WAS A JOKE.

153
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:57,302
IF YOU KNOW A THING ABOUT ME,

154
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:00,539
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

155
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,573
>> Shannon: LET US KNOW ABOUT

156
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:01,974
THE RESULTS?

157
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:04,543
>> I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOU.

158
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:05,577
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT MY

159
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:09,148
GRANDMOTHER WAS PART CHEROKEE.

160
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,116
>> Shannon: ARE YOU BEING

161
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:11,483
FACETIOUS?

162
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:13,185
>> NO, BUT TOLD THAT BUT NOW I'M

163
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:14,219
GOING TO FIND OUT.

164
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,955
I'LL HAVE TO DO IS BE ONE-TENTH

165
00:05:16,956 --> 00:00:00,000
OF 1% AND THEN I WILL WIN THE
