Syrians here they just want the paper to
get up from this island for no

the desperation is so great that
whenever anyone comes to give them just
basic things people even start fighting
because they have nothing
there is no Tyler there is no better no
electric nothing nothing
I don't know not the country for the
refugee people in this island the buoys
mission and Gaza and the government it
don't care about us mr. Crozier
