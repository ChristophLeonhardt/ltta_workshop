but it's it's really not funny anymore when you consider what's going on with the president his legal team and his failure to obviously as you indicated tweet about anybody he fears and he really fears what's happening yeah he really does and you know his struggle to stack his legal team continues as a prominent Chicago defense attorney and his partner both declined an invitation to represent the president United States now think about how extraordinary that is this is the dream of a lifetime for any attorney to be able to represent the President of the United States thing about it you're billing hours while sitting in the Oval Office talking to the most powerful person in the free world and yet every lawyer keeps coming back telling Donald Trump regardless of the tweets the same thing no sir no thank you we don't want to have anything to do with you and the latest is Dan Webb a former US Attorney and the Reagan administration and a special prosecutor during iran-contra he said he couldn't join the team since Webb represents billionaire oleg arks with ties to Paul Manafort now Webb's office also said quote President Trump reached out to Dan Webb and Tom Buchanan to provide legal representation they were unable to take on representation due to business conflicts however they consider the opportunity to represent the president to be the highest honor and they sincerely regret that they cannot do so it's like when you're in high school and every girl you ask out says you are the sweetest guy in the world but no I'm not going to the dance with you that's what keeps happening to this president this as another Republican really prominent Republican lawyer turned Donald Trump down Ted Olson said no one is asking to be on that team nobody wants to be on that team and David korten is reporting that he asked Olson about being recruited for Trump squad and he rolled his eyes suggesting that he was never going to be his lawyer that wasn't going to happen and it's not just a matter of conflicts corne continued didn't asked in the last few days has any lawyer come to you it's I'm willing to work for Trump corner writes with hesitation Olsen said no yesterday Olsen told Andrea Mitchell that he's taken aback by the amount of chaos and turnover within the Trump administration I think everybody would agree this is turmoil as chaos is confusion it's not good for anything we always believe that there should be an orderly process and of course government is not clean orderly ever ever but this seems to be beyond normal boundaries that mean meanwhile we've heard multiple explanations for why Donald Trump turned around quickly on to legal team members that he had added early in the weekend an official statement said that Joseph digenova and Victoria Thanh Singh's conflicts prevented them from joining the team there yet we hear conflicts again but unnamed administration sources claimed it was more personal according to the New York Times Trump met with a pair of lawyers but did not believe he had personal chemistry with them and a senior administration official told POLITICO that Donald Trump believed the couple looked disheveled not really where to go with that but Richard Haass you've been around Washington a very long time lawyers figure out a way around not representing clients who have conflicts with the president the United States they figured out a way to get there but it is very clear and we've heard it around Washington you heard Ted Olson talk about it nobody wants to be this guy's law you're as we said yesterday don't want to be his lawyer because first of all he doesn't pay his bills and secondly he lies to lawyers all the time they can't trust him going into court and talk about how significant this is now as we have robert muller lining up all of his evidence lining up as witnesses getting all the cooperating with all the cooperating witnesses with him i mean this is a president that is going into the legal battle of his life and it's he's basically unilaterally disarmed himself exactly and look Joe there aren't too many people who have come out of this administration with their reputation enhanced let me just put it generously this morning indeed a lot of them face open-ended legal challenges because of what they did in this administration again your lawyer I'm not but I would think this would be one of the most difficult if not the most difficult imaginable client so whether it's the tweets or whether it is what it is you don't know whenever he wants in a while he decide he wants to represent himself the the inconsistency the unpredictability I would think would be it would be near impossible to mount an effective defense in addition to all the stuff you or you were saying given the reputation the the the history and so forth so I'm not surprised and I think the real question is not simply whether it affects simply lawyers well more broadly how are you going to recruit the best and brightest to come into this administration given this overhang the leave a legal overhang and again the fact that so many people have left Washington diminished you know law you can put up with a lot of things too one thing John meets in law you can't put up with it's being lied to when it's you and your client in the boardroom and you're sitting there talking and you're going through the facts you have to you just sit down with your client you say listen you've got to tell me everything and whatever you tell me doesn't leave this room but I can't prepare for your case unless you tell me the truth about everything surprise me now do not surprise me in the courtroom and yet right here's Donald Trump knowing that any lawyer he gets he believes he's smarter than that lawyer he's gonna lie to him and there's no way that he can mount any defense for for for Donald Trump yeah and interestingly we're all kind of in that position aren't we I mean we're all kind of asked me and please don't surprise us anymore and yet it happens I totally agree with Richard I think the the broader point is is really riveting so he can't find someone to defend him and it even more important in many ways the people he finds to serve him there for us are people like the new national security adviser and people who are not how do we put it on the the a team of the of the Seine and so I think that we're in this this odd position where his we sometimes think of the presidency and been rightly is the loneliest job and then if the buck stops there but it's a big operation and you have to have people who you can trust and people that we can trust to actually execute the public business and right now from everything I know you're hearing and that that I'm hearing people just don't want to go
