can a on mark Latham we've seen major corporations in Australia become very very political like their social justice warriors well it's time to hold them to account about the true meaning of inclusivity and tolerance well if you ask the question in Australia who is the most political corporate leader in sight was this guy wouldn't you Alan Joyce from Qantas he spent a huge amount of money here in his own personal time and resources recently on campaigning for gay marriage in Australia and he's all over the social justice issues he tells us that we need to be tolerant we need to be inclusive of people and who's these understudy who's the number to social justice guy is turned his corporation into a political outfit well you'd say it was Brian Hartzell wouldn't you're the head of Westpac the bank that ahead of the others set up its diversity and inclusion unit well wouldn't you expect these two guys heart sir and Joyce to make sure that in their corporate dealings they're not endorsing intolerance they're not endorsing bigotry they're not signing up in partnerships with a racist now wouldn't you think they'd be doing that well let's have a look let's have a look at what they've been doing by way of corporate partnership here's the evidence of Alan Joyce Aquinas signing up with junkie for the equivalent of an in-flight magazine supposedly appealing to young people called AWOL and of course who's one of the editors at junkie Osmund Farooqi this guy Osmond Farooqi and we know his form with Andy white racism and over there at Westpac who's signing up paying the dollars over to junkie corporate partnership well yeah it's hearts are in his outfit the diversity and inclusion unit must have missed this one because they've got a financial magazine you know trying to hook young people into handing their money over and investing at Westpac it's called the cusp here's the evidence of the cusp and the corporate agreement between Westpac and junkie so how is it the Joyce and hearts up in these circumstances can be signed up in partnership with junkie and Osmond Farooqi if you need the evidence about Farooqi let's have a look at it let's have a look at these shockingly anti white racist tweets on Australia Day 2016 he loves the debate about sunscreen just more evidence that white people don't belong in Australia really and then on the 26th of December is even 20 against white people on Boxing Day of 2016 mediocre white people they should be in the bin but instead they own everything and their every effing where and as a rule he says on the 2nd of July of this year uses all media appearances Osmond Farooqi to make fun of white people imagine we said that someone went on the media to make fun of black people or brown people or Asian people shocking shocking racism a denigrating people not because he knows them or understands them or has had any dealings with these particular people but solely because of their skin colour and then just to cap it off on the 2nd of September this year or I'm regularly surprised at how white people freak out when you call them white people well they freak out because you're an anti white races for uki that's why they freak out and they don't like this stuff so how is it that we've copped all these lectures off the Joyce at Qantas and hearts are at Westpac and it ends up there in corporate partnership with someone peddling racism you know strategies don't believe was and why we got to cop all these sanctimonious pious lectures about our morality when these guys are dealing with the dollars dealing the dollars over to junkie and Osman for uki now of course if Haruki was in charge of Qantas he would let white people on the planes he'd make them walk if Farouk he was in charge of Westpac no loans or financial arrangements with white people they can go live in the poorhouse and it goes beyond that you know you've got all these government outfits now with their statements against racial discrimination well there's three government organisations that have actually sponsored articles on junky edited by osman Farooqi one of their editors here they are the National Gallery of Australia the Australian National University and New South Wales TAFE based in western Sydney sponsored articles junkie where one of the editors is this anti-white racism kruky well this stuff you know please someone pass me a bucket passed me the spear bag from an aeroplane Alan Joyce how are we going to cop this sort of hypocrisy it's just absolutely disgraceful that this guy Farooqi gets away with the anti-white racism I've stood up to him we know the the case of law fair it's absolutely shameful well even worse is the hypocrisy of the social justice warriors parading their morality around making statements running campaigns nothing to do with their core business or the financial interests of their owners it's all virtue signalling out there in the corporate sector and it's a big stinking pile of hypocrisy I'm not putting up with it any longer we're going to hold these people to account they want to lecture us about inclusivity and tolerance well how about they break their arrangements with Farooqi instead of dealing in a corporate partnership with anti-white racism absolutely shameful and if you like that video please share it with all your family and friends on social media and sign up
