WOMAN WHOSE LIFE IS

RIDICULE HER LOOKS?

61
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:35,770
>> YEAH.

62
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,907
I THOUGHT THIS WOMAN, LOOK,

63
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,742
ON THE SCALE OF THING AS NUN

64
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,310
JOKE ISN'T THAT HIGH.

65
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,045
IN THE SENSE WE HAVE GOT

66
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:46,047
CHRISTIANS BEING BEHEADED

67
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:47,415

69
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:49,918
THIS ISN'T SUCH A BIG DEAL.

70
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:51,719
NOT ABOUT HATING ON JIMMY

71
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,188
KIMMEL BUT THIS WOMAN HAS

72
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:56,791
PUT THE NEEDS OF OTHERS AT

73
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,992
THE CENTER OF HER LIFE AND

74
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,394
LIVED THIS RICH, FULL LIFE

75
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:01,062
AND KEEPS THIS SCHOOL GOING.

76
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:02,530
SHE DESERVES MORE THAN TO BE

77
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,899
THE LAUGH LINE OF LATE NIGHT

78
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:05,400
TV.

79
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,734
BRIAN: WHAT HAS BEEN THE

80
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,536
FEELING AMONG THE PARENTS

81
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:09,904
WHO SEND THEIR KIDS TO THAT

82
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:11,172
STORY OR AMONG THE GRADUATES

83
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:11,840
WHO KNOW HER?

84
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,473
>> YEAH.

85
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:14,242
I THINK, I MEAN IN SOME

86
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,844
WAYS, LOOK, AGAIN, IT'S NOT

87
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,445
ABOUT HATING ON JIMMY

88
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:18,513
KIMMEL, I DON'T THINK HE

89
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,447
INTENDED ANY HARM.

90
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:21,115
AND IN SOME WAYS IT MAY BE

91
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:22,183
THIS IS A WAY TO BRING HER

92
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,084
STORY OUT IN THE PUBLIC.

93
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:24,485
IF HE HADN'T DONE THAT I

94
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:25,520
WOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN THE

95
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,854
COLUMN.

96
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,222
AND I'M HEARING FROM A LOT

97
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,858
OF PEOPLE, SOME THAT KNOW

98
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,426
SISTER PAT AND SOME THAT

99
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:32,493
KNOW SISTER PATS IN THEIR

100
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:33,194
OWN LIFE.

101
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,796
THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

102
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:35,630
SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO PUT

103
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,165
THE NEEDS OF OTHERS BEFORE

104
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:39,467
THEIR OWN.

105
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,335
BRIAN: WHAT HAS BEEN HER

106
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:40,702
REACTION?

107
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,704
DOES SHE EVEN KNOW WHO JIMMY

108
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,071
KIMMEL IS.

109
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:44,706
>> I'M NOT SURE SHE KNOWS.

110
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,174
I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T GIVE IT

111
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:47,976
A MOMENT'S THOUGHT.

112
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:51,012
SHE IS JUST TOO BUSY.

113
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:52,347
THIS PROVES THAT THE SCHOOL,

114
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:53,948
YOU KNOW, IT IS BASED ON

115
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,283
DISCIPLINE, WHICH COMES FROM

116
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:58,486
THE LATIN TO INSTRUCT.

117
00:02:58,486 --> 00:02:59,854
IT'S REALLY BUILT ON LOVE.

118
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:01,489
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE

119
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:02,991
PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW

120
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:04,259
SISTER PAT KNOW THAT THIS IS

121
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,627
AN ENTERPRISE OF LOVE.

122
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:07,228
LOVE IS NOT HALLMARK.

123
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,396
LOVE IS BEING THERE FOR THE

124
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,265
GIRL THAT GETS PREGNANT.

125
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,966
FOR THE GIRL THAT HAS DRUG

126
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:12,300
PROBLEM.

127
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,935
THE GIRL WHO LOST HER MOM TO

128
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:14,269
CANCER.

129
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,403
THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS.

130
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,405
AND THAT'S THE PROMISE THAT

131
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,641
SISTER MAKES TO THESE GIRLS.

132
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:20,942
I CAN'T PROTECT YOU FROM ALL

133
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,378
OF LIFE'S TRIALS AND

134
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:23,811
TRIBULATIONS.

135
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:26,080
BUT YOU WILL NEVER HURT

136
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,447
ALONE.

137
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:27,782
BRIAN: SO YOU WROTE THIS

138
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:28,950
COLUMN, AND THE RESPONSE HAS

139
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,618
BEEN OVERWHELMING BECAUSE IN

140
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:33,621
THE #ME TOO MOVEMENT SHOULD

141
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:35,123
WE REALLY BE RIDICULING

142
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:35,990
SOMEONE HOW THEY LOOK?

143
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,859
>> AGAIN, IT'S A LITTLE JOKE

144
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,127
BUT THERE IS A RICH LIFE AND

145
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:40,228
A HUMAN BEING BEHIND.

146
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,130
THIS AND THE HUMAN BEING WHO

147
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,031
HAS DONE EXTRAORDINARY

148
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,364
THINGS.

149
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:44,565
I MEAN, SHE WAS HELD UP

150
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,868
BECAUSE SHE IS NOT

151
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:47,268
FASHIONABLE.

152
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,670
HER CLOTHING IS DISMISSED AS

153
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,207
A LINE FROM J.C. PENNEYS.

154
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:54,142
HER CLOTHE SOMETHING A

155
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,777
STATEMENT THAT I HAVE MORE

156
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,577
HIRE PRIORITIES THAN THE

157
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:58,246
WORLD AND FASHION AND SO

158
00:03:58,246 --> 00:03:58,680
FORTH.

159
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,115
IT'S ABOUT THE DENIAL OF

160
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,283
SELF TO SERVING OTHERS.

161
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,217
THERE ARE GENERATIONS OF

162
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:04,719
WOMEN THAT HAVE BENEFITED.

163
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,554
I MEAN, WE DROP OUR KIDS OFF

164
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:09,290
AS GIRLS TO SISTER PAT, YOU

165
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,025
KNOW, UNSURE, UNFORMED.

166
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,293
AND FOUR YEARS LATER THEY

167
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,828
WALK OUT STRONG, CONFIDENT

168
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:15,163
WOMEN.

169
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:16,497
BRIAN: AND TO SEE HER MOCKED

170
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:16,930
BOTHERED YOU?

171
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,332
>> YEAH.

172
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:18,700
IT BOTHERED ME.

173
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,435
AGAIN, ON A SCALE OF THINGS,

174
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:22,370
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T OUTRAGED.

175
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,072
BUT I JUST THINK THIS LIFE

176
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:26,574
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

177
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:28,076
SISTER PATS ACROSS THIS

178
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:28,543
COUNTRY.

179
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,677
IT JUST DESERVES BETTER.

180
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:30,945
IT DESERVES A LITTLE MORE

181
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:32,747
RESPECT AND FOR PEOPLE TO

182
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:36,617
KNOW, YOU KNOW, BEHIND THIS

183
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:38,286
CARICATURE, INCREDIBLY JONG

184
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:38,586
WOMAN.

185
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,288
YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR

186
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:41,489
CHRISTIE'S KIDS WENT TO THE

187
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,557
SAME SCHOOL.

188
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:44,559
HE TWEETED OUT SUGGESTING

189
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,560
THAT JIMMY KIMMEL HAVE HER

190
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,527
ON TO SHARE WITH THE

191
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:47,895
AUDIENCE WHAT A LIFE OF

192
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,030
