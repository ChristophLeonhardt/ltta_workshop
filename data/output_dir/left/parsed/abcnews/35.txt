>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOLOUS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR RIGHT 
NOW BECAUSE REX TILLERSON, THE 
MAN FIRED AS SECRETARY OF STATE 
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST THIS 
MORNING HAS JUST APPEARED IN THE
STATE DEPARTMENT BRIEFING ROOM.
LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAS TO 
SAY.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, ALL.
I RECEIVED A CALL TODAY FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A
LITTLE AFTER NOONTIME FROM AIR 
FORCE I AND I'VE ALSO SPOKEN TO 
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF K
KELLY.
TO ENSURE WE HAVE CLARITY TO THE
DAYS AHEAD, WHAT'S MOST 
IMPORTANT IS TO ENSURE AN 
ORDERLY AND SMOOTH TRANSITION 
DURING THE TIME THE COUNTRY 
CONTINUES TO FACE SIGNIFICANT 
POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY 
CHALLENGES.
AS SUCH, EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF
THE DAY, I'M DELEGATING ALL 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE 
OF THE SECRETARY TO DEPUTY 
SECRETARY OF STATE SULLIVAN.
MY COMMISSION AS SECRETARY OF 
STATE WILL TERMINATE AT 
MIDNIGHT, MARCH 31st.
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, I'LL 
ADDRESS A FEW ADMINISTRATIVE 
MATTERS RELATE TO DO MY 
DEPARTURE AND WORK TOWARD A 
SMOOTH AND ORDERLY TRANSITION 
FOR SECRETARY OF STATE DESIGNATE
MIKE POMPEO.
I'M ENCOURAGING MY POLICY 
PLANNING TEAM AND 
UNDERSECRETARIES AND ASSISTANT 
SECRETARIES, THOSE CONFIRMED, AS
WELL AS THOSE IN ACTING 
POSITIONS, TO REMAIN AT THEIR 
POST AND CONTINUE OUR MISSION AT
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND WORKING
WITH THE INTERAGENCY PROCESS.
I WILL BE MEETING MEMBERS OF MY 
FRONT OFFICE, TEAM AND POLICY 
PLANNING, LATER TODAY TO THANK 
THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE.
THEY HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY 
DEDICATED TO OUR MISSION, WHICH 
INCLUDES PROMOTING VALUES THAT I
VIEW AS BEING VERY IMPORTANT.
FOR THE SECURITY OF OUR 
PERSONNEL, ACCOUNTABILITY, WHICH
MEANS TWEETING EACH OTHER WITH 
RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER.
MOST RECENTLY IN PARTICULAR TO 
ADDRESS CHALLENGES OF SEXUAL 
HARRASSMENT WITHIN THE 
DEPARTMENT.
I WANT TO SPEAK NOW TO MY STATE 
DEPARTMENT COLLEAGUES AND TO OUR
INTERAGENCY COLLEAGUES AND 
PARTNERS AT D.O.D. AND THE JOINT
CHIEFS OF STAFFS, MOST 
PARTICULARLY.
TO MY FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS 
AND CIVIL SERVICE COLLEAGUES, WE
ALL TOOK THE SAME OATH OF OFFICE
WHETHER YOU'RE A CAREER EMPLOYEE
OR APPOINTEE, WE ARE ALL BOUND 
BY THAT COMMON COMMITMENT, TO 
SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE 
CONSTITUTION, TO BEAR TRUE FAITH
AND ALLEGIANCE TO THE SAME, AND 
TO FITAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THE 
DUTIES OF OUR OFFICE.
AS A STATE DEPARTMENT, WE ARE 
BOUND TOGETHER BY THAT OATH.
WE REMAIN STEADFAST HERE IN 
WASHINGTON AND AT POST ACROSS 
THE WORLD, MANY OF WHOM RAARE I 
DANGER SITUATIONS WITHOUT THEIR 
FAMILIES.
THE WORLD NEEDS SELFLESS LEADERS
LIKE THESE, READY TO WORK WITH 
LONGSTANDING ALLIES, NEW 
EMERGING PARTNERS AND ALLIES WHO
NOW MANY ARE STRUGGLING AS 
DEMOCRACIES AND IN SOME CASES 
ARE DEALING WITH HUMAN TRAGEDY, 
CRISIS OF NATURAL DISASTERS, 
LITERALLY CRAWLING THEMSELVES 
OUT OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.
THESE ARE EXPERIENCES THAT NO 
LECTURE HALL AND ACADEMIC 
ENVIRONMENT OR A THINK TANK CAN 
TEACH YOU.
ONLY BY PEOPLE GOING TO THE 
FRONT LINES TO SERVE CAN THEY 
DEVELOP THIS KIND OF TALENT.
TO THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM,
I'M TOLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
MOST PEOPLE'S MEMORY THE 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAVE A 
CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WHERE
WE ALL AGREE THE U.S. LEADERSHIP
STARTS WITH DIPLOMACY.
THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AT 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE UNDER 
THE LEADERSHIP OF SECRETARY 
MATTIS AND GENERAL DUNFORD 
PROTECT US AS AMERICANS IN OUR 
WAY OF LIFE DAILY AT HOME AND 
ABROAD.
AS AN ALL-VOLUNTEER MILITARY, 
THEY DO IT FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY, 
THEY DO IT FOR YOU, AND THEY DO 
IT FOR ME AND FOR NO OTHER 
REASON.
AS AMERICANS, WE ARE ALL 
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL TO EACH OF 
THEM AND WE HONOR THEIR 
SACRIFICES.
THE REWARDING PART OF HAVING 
LEADERSHIP AND PARTNERSHIPS IN 
PLACE IS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY 
GET SOME THINGS DONE.
AND I WANT TO GIVE RECOGNITION 
TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND OUR 
PARTNERS FOR A FEW OF THEIR 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER THIS 
ADMINISTRATION.
FIRST WORKING WITH ALLIES, WE 
EXCEEDED THE EXPECTATIONS OF 
ALMOST EVERYONE WITH THE DPRK 
MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN.
WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON MY VERY
FIRST TRIP AS SECRETARY OF STATE
TO THE REGION THAT THE ARAB 
STRATEGIC PATIENCE WAS OVER AND 
WE COMMENCE THE STEPS TO 
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE NOT JUST 
THE SCOPE BUT THE EFFECTIVENESS 
OF THE SANCTIONS.
THE DEPARTMENT UNDERTOOK A 
GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO BRING 
PARTNERS AND ALLIES ON BOARD IN 
EVERY COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD, 
WITH EVERY EMBASSY AND MISSION 
RAISING THIS TO THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS, AND AT EVERY MEETING 
I'VE HAD THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, 
THIS HAS BEEN ON THE AGENDA TO 
DISCUSS.
THE ADOPTION OF THE SOUTH ASIA 
STRATEGY WITH THE CONDITIONS OF 
BASE MILITARY PLAN IS THE TOOL 
TO COMPEL THE TALIBAN TO 
RECONCILIATION AND PEACE TALKS 
WITH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT.
FINALLY EQUIPPED OUR MILITARY 
PLANNERS WITH A STRATEGY WHICH 
THEY CAN EXECUTE AS OPPOSED TO A
SUCCESSION OF 16 ONE-YEAR 
STRATEGIES.
THIS CLEAR MILITARY COMMITMENT 
ATTRACTED THE SUPPORT OF ALLIES 
BROADLY AND EQUIPPED OUR 
DIPLOMATS WITH A WHOLE NEW LEVEL
OF CERTAINTY AROUND HOW TO 
PREPARE FOR THE PEACE TALKS AND 
ACHIEVE THE FINAL OBJECTIVES.
IN OTHER AREAS WHERE PROGRESS 
HAS BEEN MADE, MUCH WORK 
REMAINS.
IN SYRIA, WE DID ACHIEVE 
IMPORTANT CEASE-FIRES AND 
STABILIZATIONS WHICH WE KNOW HAS
SAVED THOUSANDS OF LIVES.
THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE IN 
SYRIA, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT
TO ACHIEVING THE PEACE AS WELL 
AS STABILIZING IRAQ AND SEEING A
HEALTHY GOVERNMENT INSTALLED.
AND MORE BROADLY THE ENTIRE 
GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT ISIS.
NOTHING IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT 
ALLIES AND PARTNERS, THOUGH.
MUCH WORK REMAINS TO ESTABLISH A
CLEAR VIEW OF THE NATURE OF OUR 
FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.
HOW SHALL WE DEAL WITH ONE 
ANOTHER OVER THE NEXT 50 YEARS 
AND ENSURE A PERIOD OF 
PROSPERITY FOR ALL OF OUR 
PEOPLES FREE OF CONFLICT BETWEEN
TWO VERY POWERFUL NATIONS.
AND MUCH WORK REMAINS TO RESPOND
TO THE TROUBLING BEHAVIOR AND 
ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE 
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.
RUSSIA MUST ASSESS CAREFULLY AS 
TO HOW ITS AX CTIONS ARE IN THE 
BEST INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND OF THE WORLD MORE 
BROADLY.
CONTINUING ON THEIR CURRENT 
TRAJECTORY IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO 
GREATER ISOLATION ON THEIR PART,
A SITUATION WHICH IS NOT IN 
ANYONE'S INTEREST.
SO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND INTERAGENCY, MUCH
REMAINS TO BE DONE TO ACHIEVE 
OUR MISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WITH ALLIES AND WITH PARTNERS.
I CLOSE BY THANKING ALL FOR THE 
PRIVILEGE OF SERVING BESIDE YOU 
FOR THE LAST 14 MONTHS.
IMPORTANTLY TO THE 300-PLUS 
MILLION AMERICANS, THANK YOU FOR
YOUR DEVOTION TO A FREE AND OPEN
SOCIETY, TO ACTS OF KINDNESS 
TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER, TO HONESTY 
AND THE QUIET, HARD WORK THAT 
YOU DO EVERY DAY TO SUPPORT THIS
GOVERNMENT WITH YOUR TAX 
DOLLARS.
ALL OF US, WE KNOW, WANT TO 
LEAVE THIS PLACE AS A BETTER 
PLACE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.
I'LL NOW RETURN TO PRIVATE LIFE 
AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, AS A PROUD
AMERICAN, PROUD OF THE 
OPPORTUNITY I'VE HAD TO SERVE MY
COUNTRY.
GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU.
GOD BLESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
>> REX TILLERSON THERE LEAVING 
THE BRIEFING ROOM AFTER SAYING 
HE'LL BE TURNING OVER ALL 
RESPONSIBILITIES AS SECRETARY OF
STATE AT THE END OF THE DAY TO 
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN 
SULLIVAN.
THE SECRETARY SAID HE RECEIVED A
CALL FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP A 
LITTLE AFTER NOON TODAY TO TALK 
ABOUT AN ORDERLY TRANSITION.
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS
THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THE 
FIRING HIMSELF IN A TWEET AT 
8:00 A.M. AND THEN ANNOUNCED IT 
BEFORE GETTING ON A PLANE THIS 
MORNING.
>> REX TILLERSON AND I GOT ALONG
QUITE WELL BUT WE DISAGREED ON 
THINGS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL, 
I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE.
HE THINKS IT'S OKAY.
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING AND HE 
FELT DIFFERENTLY.
SO WE WERE NOT REALLY THINKING 
THE SAME.
WITH MIKE POMPEO, WE HAVE A VERY
SIMILAR THOUGHT PROCESS.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO VERY 
WELL.
REX IS A VERY GOOD MAN, I LIKE 
REX A LOT.
I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS 
COMMITMENT AND HIS SERVICE, AND 
I'LL BE SPEAKING TO REX OVER A 
LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE TALKING
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES HE HAD 
WITH REX TILLERSON, ALSO PRAISED
THE INCOMING SECRETARY OF STATE 
AS NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF 
STATE MIKE POMPEO, CIA DIRECTOR.
I'M HERE WITH CECILIA VEGA.
CECILIA, THIS IS SOMETHING WE 
HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN BEFORE, THE 
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCING THE FIRING 
OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE BEFORE
TELLING HIM.
>> AND THAT WAS JUST BEFORE HE 
TRAVELED TO CALIFORNIA.
MAKE NO BONES, THERE IS BAD 
BLOOD BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN AND 
IT IS LONGSTANDING.
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPY WITH 
EACH OTHER.
THE PRESIDENT SAID IRAN HAD A 
DEAL WITH PRESIDENT KIM JONG-UN.
SECRETARY TILLERSON USED THE 
WORD MORON TO DESCRIBE PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING.
THE FACT THAT IT HAPPENED NOW IS
A COMPLETE SURPRISE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CHAOS 
INVOLVING THIS WHITE HOUSE RIGHT
NOW.
THIS IS NOW THE SEVENTH SENIOR 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL TO LEAVE
THIS WHITE HOUSE THIS YEAR 
ALONE.
AND THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID IN 
RECENT DAYS THAT HE LIKES TO SEE
COMPETING VOICES.
WE ARE NOW SEEING THE SECOND 
VERY HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL 
INSIDE THAT WHITE HOUSE TO LEAVE
GARY CO HEN, THE CHIEF ECONOMIC 
ADVISER, OUT JUST A FEW MOMENTS 
AGO.
>> AND THIS COMES BEFORE THE 
MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN OF 
NORTH KOREA.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE CLEARLY 
BLINDSIDED BY THE PRESIDENT'S 
DECISION TO SEEK A SUMMIT LAST 
WEEK, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN 
ARGUING FOR TALKS FOR MANY 
MONTHS BEFORE WITH KIM JONG-UN 
AND BEEN SHOT DOWN BY THE 
PRESIDENT.
>> HE HAD BEEN SHOT DOWN IN 
ABOUT 48 HOURS BEFORE THE 
PRESIDENT ACCEPTED THAT SUMMIT.
REX TILLERSON SAID IT WASN'T THE
TIME FOR NEGOTIATIONS, SO HE HAD
TO BACKTRACK WITH THAT STATEMENT
AS WELL.
THINK ABOUT THE DAY THAT REX 
TILLERSON HAS HAD TODAY.
HE ARRIVED BACK IN WASHINGTON, 
D.C. AT 4:00 A.M. THIS MORNING.
HOURS LATER THE PRESIDENT TWEETS
THAT HE IS FIRED.
IF HE SOUNDED A LITTLE BIT 
WINDED AND EMOTIONAL IN THAT 
STATEMENT, IT IS BECAUSE I'M 
SURE HE IS EXHAUSTED, AND AS YOU
BOTH SAID, HE HAS BEEN 
BLINDSIDED BY THIS DECISION.
ALTHOUGH HE CERTAINLY HAD A HINT
ABOUT THAT.
AT THE END OF LAST YEAR, THERE 
WAS A LOT OF TALK THAT REX 
TILLERSON WAS ON HIS WAY OUT 
AFTER IT WAS REPORTED 
PARTICULARLY THAT HE HAD SAID IN
PRIVATE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS A
MORON.
THERE WAS MUCH TALK THAT HE 
WOULD BE OUT THE DOOR.
THE PRESIDENT DENIED THAT IN A 
TWEET, SAID IT WASN'T GOING TO 
HAPPEN.
BUT WE HAVE IT TODAY AND A BIG 
SURPRISE.
>> AND THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO 
ANNOUNCING THE FIRING OF THE 
NUMBER 4 OFFICIAL, 
UNDERSECRETARY STEVE GOLDSTEIN, 
WHO HAD PUT OUT STATEMENT SAYING
THAT REX TILLERSON HADN'T BEEN 
CALLED BY THE PRESIDENT.
AT LEAST TO THE BROADER QUESTION
ABOUT THE WHOLE FOREIGN POLICY 
TEAM AT THIS POINT, THE STAFFING
IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND IN 
THE FOREIGN SERVICE, AND WHETHER
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THE TEAM 
IN PLACE TO PREPARE FOR THIS 
SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA.
>> AND THAT'S THE QUESTION, 
GEORGE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
THERE ARE SO MANY UNFILLED 
POSITIONS.
THERE IS NO AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH 
KOREA RIGHT NOW, ALTHOUGH THERE 
IS A VERY CAPABLE NUMBER 2 IN 
CHARGE THERE IN SEOUL.
BUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND 
STEVE GOLDSTEIN TODAY FIRED.
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE
STATE DEPARTMENT SO SUDDENLY, 
AND THIS IS THE STATEMENT HE 
MADE.
HE IS THE UNDERSECRETARY OR WAS 
THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR 
DIPLOMACY.
THE SECRETARY HAD EVERY 
INTENTION OF STAYING BECAUSE OF 
THE CRITICAL PROGRESS MADE IN 
NATIONAL SECURITY.
THE SECRETARY DID NOT SPEAK TO 
THE PRESIDENT AND IS UNAWARE OF 
THE REASON HE WAS FIRED, AND 
WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THE 
MAN WHO PUT THAT STATEMENT OUT, 
FIRED.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE 
SEEING RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW IS 
SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT WANTED 
TO DO.
HE WANTED TO MEET WITH KIM 
JONG-UN OF NORTH KOREA.
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO IT 
DESPITE THE ADVICE OF HIS 
EXPERTS.
AND MIKE POMPEO, DIRECTOR OF THE
CIA, IN AS SECRETARY OF STATE.
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.
>> AND HE SAID HE WAS ON THE WAY
TO GETTING HIS CABINET EXACTLY 
THE MAKEUP HE WANTS IT TO BE.
WE KNOW FROM SOURCES ON THE 
OUTSIDE THAT STILL TALK TO 
PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY ISOLATED AND HE IS 
INCREASINGLY ANGRY.
YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER IF THIS IS 
A RESULT OF THE EMOTION THE 
PRESIDENT IS FEELING RIGHT NOW.
>> UPCOMING HEARINGS NOW FROM 
MIKE POMPEO TO BE SECRETARY OF 
STATE.
ALSO GINA HASPEL, CAREER CIA 
OFFICER, HAS NOW BEEN 
APPOINTED -- NOMINATED TO BE 
HEAD OF THE CIA, THE FIRST WOMAN
TO LEAD THE CIA.
>> SHE IS THE FIRST WOMAN TO 
LEAD THE CIA, AND WITHIN THE 
CIA, I THINK SHE IS VERY WELL 
LIKED.
THERE WILL BE MANY QUESTIONS 
ABOUT HER PAST IN 2002.
SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF ONE OF 
THOSE SO-CALLED BLACK SITES 
WHERE THEY DID ENHANCED 
INTERROGATION AND ALSO WITH THE 
DESTRUCTION OF THE TAPES FROM 
THAT, SO SHE WILL FACE QUESTIONS
ABOUT THAT.
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT.
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
IS OUT.
HE'LL BE TURNING OVER ALL 
RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE END OF 
THE DAY.
