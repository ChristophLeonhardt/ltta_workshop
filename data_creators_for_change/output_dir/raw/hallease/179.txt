smell is always kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like sort of</font>

49
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,879
just kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a more earthy you know</font>

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,180
smell that's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think light on the</font>

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,980
fragrance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not very floral but it's</font>

52
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,019

ingredients<font color="#CCCCCC"> or anything that might be it</font>

58
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,260
Japanese honeysuckle flower extract that

59
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,120
might be the smell I'm smelling this is

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,049

61
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,470
