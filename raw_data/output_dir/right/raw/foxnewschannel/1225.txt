1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,139
PROBABLY MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU.

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:07,544
AND THEY CANCELED AFTER BARR

3
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:09,913
TWEETED ABOUT FORMER OBAMA

4
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:11,447
STAFFER VALERIE JARRETT.

5
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:13,016
AND IN THE SAME WEEK, THERE IS

6
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:15,451
MORE FALLOUT OVER TV

7
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:16,553
PERSONALITIES JOY REED AND

8
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:17,754
SAMANTHA BEE.

9
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:20,256
BOTH HAVE ISSUED APOLOGIES FOR

10
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:21,291
CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS AND

11
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,692
RECEIVED SHOWS OF SUPPORT FROM

12
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:23,993
THEIR RESPECTIVE NETWORKS.

13
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:25,929
THE SEEMINGLY LACK OF PUNISHMENT

14
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,997
HAS IRKED MANY AMERICANS,

15
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:28,898
INCLUDING PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO

16
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:30,667
SHOWED SUPPORT FOR ROSEANNE BARR

17
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,268
FOLLOWING HER SHOW'S

18
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:33,102
CANCELLATION.

19
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:35,538
HERE TO WEIGH IN, HARRISBURG

20
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:37,574
PENNSYLVANIA HOST, RJ HARRIS,

21
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:39,609
580 ON THE DIAL AS YOU DRIVE

22
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,211
THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND FOR THE

23
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:45,381
REST OF US ON THE WORLDWIDE WEB.

24
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:46,115
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

25
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:48,885
LELAND: THERE'S A DISTINCTION

26
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:50,286
YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT WHAT EACH OF

27
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:53,223
THE WOMEN DID OR SAID, JOY REED

28
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:55,124
WITH FORMER BLOG POST FROM TEN

29
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:57,227
YEARS AND SAMANTHA BEE WHO USED

30
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:59,362
C-WORD TO DESCRIBE THE

31
00:00:59,362 --> 00:01:00,363
PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER.

32
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:00,863
WHATEVER IT IS.

33
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:02,532
THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS, BUT IS

34
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:03,466
THERE A DIFFERENCE IN WHAT THEY

35
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:05,702
DID AND A DIFFERENCE HOW THEY'RE

36
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:07,804
TREATED BY THEIR NETWORKS?

37
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:09,272
>> NO, THAT REALLY IS--

38
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:10,306
THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD.

39
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:12,642
IN FACT, AMERICA IS A MINEFIELD

40
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:15,478
OF DOUBLE STANDARDS RIGHT NOW.

41
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:17,780
IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE, AND IN

42
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,482
EVERY SECTION OF LIFE, YOU NAME

43
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:23,253
IT, SEX, DRUGS, ROCK AND ROLL,

44
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:24,387
POLITICS, THERE'S DOUBLE

45
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:25,722
STANDARDS EVERYWHERE.

46
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:27,790
YOU TAKE THE N-WORD, I THINK

47
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,559
THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES

48
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,361
WHERE IT'S A HORRIBLE WORD,

49
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,862
NOBODY SHOULD USE IT, BUT IF

50
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:33,630
YOU'RE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOU CAN

51
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,634
GET AWAY WITH IT, AND IF YOU'RE

52
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:38,601
SANCTIONED BY AN

53
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:39,369
AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOU MAY BE ABLE

54
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,571
TO GET AWAY WITH IT, BUT NOBODY

55
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:42,672
SHOULD BE USING THE WORD.

56
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:49,779
IT'S A HORRIBLE WORD, IT'S A

57
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,681
VERY CONFUSING TIME FOR MANY.

58
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:53,950
LELAND: AND CONFUSING TIME FOR

59
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,451
SOMEONE SUCH AS YOURSELF.

60
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,919
AS YOU POINT OUT IF SOMEONE

61
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,121
PERSON SAYS SOMETHING, IT'S

62
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,423
OKAY, IF YOU SAY IT AS AN OLDER

63
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,158
WHITE MALE AS A CONSERVATIVE

64
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:04,360
RADIO HOST YOU'RE GOING TO BE

65
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,129
STRUNG UP FROM THE LIGHT POST.

66
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:10,066
>> I KNOW THIS IS SOUNDS KIND OF

67
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,968
HOKEY, BUT MY MOTHER BROUGHT ME

68
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:13,369
UP TO PRETTY MUCH RESPECT

69
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:13,770
EVERYONE.

70
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,204
I HAVE COMMON SENSE ANNOY WHAT

71
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:17,473
WILL FLY AND WON'T FLY.

72
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:19,809
BEING HERE IN HARRISBURG,

73
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:20,576
PENNSYLVANIA, I'M VERY FORTUNATE

74
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,178
BECAUSE I DO SAY AND GET AWAY

75
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:23,613
WITH THINGS ON THE AIR THAT IF I

76
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:25,048
WAS DOING THIS NATIONALLY, I'D

77
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:27,483
JUST BE, YOU KNOW, RUN OUT OF

78
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,718
TOWN ON A RAIL.

79
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:30,286
LELAND: WELL, JOY REED IS NOT

80
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:34,390
BEING RUN OUT OF TOWN BY HER

81
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,757
NETWORK.

82
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:37,460
THIS IS WHAT MSNBC SAID ABOUT

83
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,661
HER BLOG POST.

84
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,730
SOME THINGS WRITTEN BY JOY ON

85
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,766
OTHER OLD BLOG ARE HATEFUL AND

86
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:44,133
HURTFUL.

87
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,469
JOY APOLOGIZED PUBLICLY AND

88
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,405
PRIVATELY AND GROWN AND EVOLVED

89
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,174
SINCE AND WE KNOW THIS TO BE

90
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:51,574
TRUE.

91
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:54,877
IS THERE VALUE IN THAT, RJ, FOR

92
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:56,012
NETWORKS NOT TO FIRE PEOPLE AND

93
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,947
TO ALLOW, IF SOMEONE APOLOGIZES

94
00:02:57,947 --> 00:02:59,515
OR RESTATES SOMETHING, TO HAVE A

95
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:01,584
SECOND CRACK AT IT?

96
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:04,687
>> WELL, I DO THINK IT DEPENDS

97
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:06,856
ON WHAT YOU'RE HIRING THEM TO

98
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:09,992
DO, AND ARE THEY SAYING IT

99
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:10,426
PERSONALLY?

100
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:13,529
AND THEY'RE OWN AREAS, LIKE

101
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:14,864
FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND ALL

102
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:16,466
THAT OR ARE THEY DOING IT ON THE

103
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:16,766
JOB?

104
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,368
AND IF THEY'RE DOING IT ON THE

105
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,635
JOB, IS THAT WHAT YOU HIRED THEM

106
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:20,103
TO DO?

107
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,839
DID YOU HIRE THEM TO BE

108
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,306
CONTROVERSIAL?

109
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:25,408
DID YOU HIRE THEM, YOU KNOW, TO

110
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:26,275
GO DOWN THAT PATH?

111
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,010
IF YOU DID, I THINK YOU OWE IT

112
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,045
TO THEM TO SUPPORT THEM AND

113
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:31,314
THAT'S WHAT YOU HIRED THEM TO

114
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:31,581
DO.

115
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:37,787
>> IS THERE A DANGER IN THE

116
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:41,591
THOUGHT POLICE WORLD, IF YOU'RE

117
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,159
OUTRAGEOUS, YOU COULD SOMEHOW BE

118
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,361
FIRED, IS THAT HOW WE GO DOWN

119
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,230
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE IN THE FIRST

120
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,530
PLACE?

121
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,431
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

122
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,699
I WORK IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I

123
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,434
NEVER HAVE TO LOOK OVER MY

124
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:52,902
SOLDIER AND WONDER WHETHER OR

125
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:55,037
NOT I SHOULD SAY THIS OR SHOULD

126
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:57,306
I GET DOWN THAT PATH.

127
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:59,542
MY MANAGEMENT SUPPORTS ME A TO

128
00:03:59,542 --> 00:03:59,809
Z.

129
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,043
BUT THEY ALSO KNOW THAT I'M

130
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:02,412
RESPONSIBLE AND THAT I'M NOT

131
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:04,380
GOING TO FLOAT THE LICENSE OUT

132
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,114
THE DOOR.

133
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:07,183
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT I HAVE

134
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:09,619
THAT BECAUSE THAT WAY--

135
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:10,486
>> YOU SAID--

136
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,655
>> I PERFORM MY JOB AND I'M AT

137
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:13,189
MY BEST.

138
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,490
LELAND: FORGIVE ME FOR ONE

139
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,759
SECOND ON THIS.

140
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,428
YOU SAID SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

141
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:19,829
FLOAT THE LICENSE OUT THE DOOR.

142
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,532
YOU'RE ON THE AIRWAVES, THE FCC

143
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:23,733
SAYS THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU

144
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,368
CAN SAY AND SOME YOU CAN'T.

145
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:25,868
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

146
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:27,603
LELAND: ON TWITTER IT'S THE WILD

147
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:29,705
WEST AND ON CABLE THE WILD WEST

148
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:31,207
AS SAMANTHA BEE PROVED AT LEAST

149
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:32,175
TO AN EXTENT.

150
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:33,376
IS THERE A TIME AND PLACE WHERE

151
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:36,679
SAYING ONE THING IS OKAY AND

152
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,780
ANOTHER THING SHOULDN'T BE?

153
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,382
>> FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, NO.

154
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:41,651
LOOK, THE WAY I HANDLE, TWITTER,

155
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:43,085
FACEBOOK AND EVERYTHING I DO IS,

156
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,688
IF I'M GOING TO DO IT OFF THE

157
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:47,590
AIR, IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME

158
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,724
AS ON THE AIR.

159
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,259
I'M GOING TO STICK TO THE SAME

160
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,661
RULES, BUT THAT'S THE WAY I RUN

161
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,462
MY LIFE.

162
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:54,297
NEVER, NOBODY'S EVER HAD TO

163
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,599
TEACH ME IN CLASSES ABOUT SEXUAL

164
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:57,900
HARASSMENT OR ANY OF THAT.

165
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,335
I WAS BROUGHT UP TO RESPECT

166
00:04:59,335 --> 00:04:59,735
EVERYBODY.

167
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:01,437
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS HOKEY,

168
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:02,772
BUT I WISH WE COULD GET BACK TO

169
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,407
MORE OF THAT.

170
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,309
LELAND: WELL, I GUESS WE COULD

171
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:09,712
SAY RJ HARRIS THE SAME, WHETHER

172
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:12,315
ONLINE, ON TWITTER,@RJ HARRIS.

173
00:05:12,315 --> 00:00:00,000
WHETHER WE HEAR YOU ON THE RADIO
