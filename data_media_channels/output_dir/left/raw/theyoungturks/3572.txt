1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,780
>>TODAY DON'T TRUMP SPOKE AT THE
VALUES VOTERS SUMMIT, THIS IS

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,899
THE FIRST TIME A SITTING
PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN AT IT.

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,102
THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT,
SINCE IT'S AN ANTI-GAY AND IN

4
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:15,920
MANY WAYS ANTIWOMAN GATHERING,
YOU WILL LOVE HIS COMMENTARY,

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,019
BUT I WANT TO TOUCH ON ONE THING
HE SAID FIRST.

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,019
HE WAS TALKING

7
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,210
ABOUT THE DISASTER RELIEF EFFORT
THAT IS ONGOING, HIM TRAVELING

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,820
TO TEXAS AND PUERTO RICO, AND HE
ALSO SAID HE TRAVELED TO THE

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,890
VIRGIN ISLANDS, WHICH OF COURSE
WERE DESTROYED IN A WAY THAT

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,079
EVEN OTHER HARD-HIT AREAS WERE
NOT, AND HE WENT THERE AND HE

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,149
SPOKE TO THEIR LEADER, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

12
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,320
WHICH IS ODD BECAUSE HE'S THE
PRESIDENT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS,

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,579
SINCE IT'S AN UNINCORPORATED
TERRITORY OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

14
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:54,170
THAT IS WORRYING, THAT HE WENT
THERE AND DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,949
WHO HE WAS THAT HE WAS SPEAKING
TO, THEY HAVE A GOVERNOR, NOT A

16
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,890
PRESIDENT, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
ARE JOKING ABOUT, BUT MY FEAR IS

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,759
THAT IF HE THINKS THEY HAVE A
PRESIDENT, DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT

18
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:09,759
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HAPPENS
THERE?

19
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:10,759
CAN YOU REALLY TRUST HIS

20
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,850
DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS IF HE
THINKS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN FULLY

21
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,140
SEPARATE GOVERNMENT AND WE ARE
THEIR ALLY OR SOMETHING

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,180
LIKE THAT?

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,909
>>WHAT DOES HE THINK IT SAYS
THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS?

24
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,060
>>IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,560
ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK HE

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,120
HAD TO GET WALKED THROUGH THE
PUERTO RICO THING.

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
I'M SURE THEY

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,860
DID IT IN A WAY SO AS NOT TO
PISS HIM OFF BUT I DON'T THINK

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,250
HE FULLY UNDERSTOOD, MR.

30
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,049
PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO TAKE

31
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,619
CARE OF PUERTO RICO, THIS IS
AMERICA.

32
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:44,829
>>JOHN, DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS ARE AN

33
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,770
AMERICAN TERRITORY,
UNINCORPORATED -- ARE YOU

34
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,770
KIDDING ME?

35
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,120
OF COURSE HE DOESN'T
KNOW.

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,110
>>UNLESS THERE IS A TRUMP
PROPERTY THERE I DON'T

37
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,740
THINK HE COULD FIND THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS.

38
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,070
>>CAN I JUST SAY ONE LAST THING?

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,110
DIES, JUST THINK ABOUT, OKAY, HE

40
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,729
DOESN'T KNOW, I KEEP USING THE
TWO PROFESSIONS, PLUMBER OR

41
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,940
DENTIST, A PLUMBER IN NORTH
CAROLINA, A DENTIST IN

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,470
CONNECTICUT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE VIRGIN

43
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,330
ISLANDS IS, THAT'S FINE.

44
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,959
YOU ARE
THE PRESIDENT, THE VIRGIN

45
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,670
ISLANDS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, YOU
ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT, AND

46
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,519
IF YOU AREN'T SURE CAN YOU JUST
DO 10 SECONDS OF HOMEWORK AND

47
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,269
ASK AN AIDE, YOU HAVE THOUSANDS
OF THEM, WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH

48
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:31,930
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS?

49
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,490
HOW SHOULD I
REFER TO THEIR LEADER?

50
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,490
MR.

51
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,640
PRESIDENT, YOU ARE THEIR
LEADER, THAT'S THE GOVERNOR.

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,159
GREAT, THANK GOD YOU TOLD ME
BEFORE THE CAMERAS ARRIVED.

53
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,690
HE DOESN'T CARE TO DO 10 SECONDS
OF HOMEWORK.

54
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,790
>>MY QUESTION IS, HOW MANY
TIMES DID HE REFER TO THE

55
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,400
GOVERNOR AS PRESIDENT AND NOBODY
CORRECTED HIM?

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,120
>>THAT'S A GREAT POINT, THERE IS
A WHOLE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES

57
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,530
THING GOING ON WITH TRUMP AND
ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN HE STEPS IN

58
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:09,819
IT BIG TIME IN TERMS OF A PUBLIC
RELATIONS THING, WHEN HE

59
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,549
SAYS SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY
FUNKY, SHIT, WHAT DO WE DO

60
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,000
WITH THIS, I THINK THAT'S WHEN
WE END UP, YOU KNOW --

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,409
>>THIS IS SCARY, THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS IS DESTROYED, PUERTO

62
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,599
RICO, IT HAS BEEN WEEKS AND IT'S
STILL IN HORRIBLE CONDITIONS,

63
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,460
THEY HAD TO PUT OUT A WARNING TO
TELL PEOPLE NOT TO DRINK FROM

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,230
SEALED CONTAINERS IN SUPERFUND
SITES BECAUSE OF THE

65
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,450
CONTAMINATION THROUGH TOXINS AND
POTENTIALLY NUCLEAR STUFF, BUT

66
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,410
PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO DO THAT
BECAUSE THERE IS NO WATER.

67
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,410
WEEKS

68
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,650
INTO THIS DISASTER AMERICAN
CITIZENS ARE HAVING TO DRINK

69
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,489
TOXIC FLUIDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T
WANT TO LITERALLY DIE OF

70
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,500
DEHYDRATION, AND WE HAVE A GUY
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

71
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,819
TERRITORIES HE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR.

72
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,140
THERE ARE MORE CONSEQUENCES

73
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,819
AND HIGHER STANDARDS FOR ROCK
STARS WHO SAY THE WRONG CITY

74
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,939
WHEN THEY OPEN A SHOW THAN THE
PRESIDENT WHEN HE VISITS THE

75
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,120
GOVERNOR OF U.S. TERRITORY,
THAT'S A SCARY STATE FOR US TO

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:00:00,000
BE IN.
