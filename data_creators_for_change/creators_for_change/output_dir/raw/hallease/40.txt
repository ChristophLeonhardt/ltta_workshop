1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:06,962
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,962 --> 00:00:08,699
Welcome back to my channel.

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,090
I have been getting a
lot of requests asking me

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,240
to do different things with my voice,

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,010
because I have such a nice voice,

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,990
so this is an attempt at ASMR.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,780
I did a little bit of research,

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,090
and learned that it's all about sounds,

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,910
and just having a very
relaxing environment.

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,970
But to make this a little different,

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,610
a little fun for you all, I've pulled

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,222
in my friend Diego here.

13
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:32,390
- Hey.

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,960
- Who is gonna provide me with the content

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,984
that I will then read
for this ASMR session.

16
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:40,710
And we're just gonna have a good time.

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,150
Before we get going though,
gonna have some tea.

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,598
Here.

19
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:46,440
(teapot dragging across table)

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,117
and we're just gonna...

21
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:48,950
- [Tiffany] Actually, it's empty.

22
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,477
- Oh, just kidding, it's empty.

23
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:56,961
(tea pouring)

24
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:57,794
Yeah.

25
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,518
That's, that's beautiful.

26
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:15,020
(teapot dragging across table)

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,240
We'll let that brew for a minute.

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,390
So while that's brewing,
let's go ahead and get going.

29
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,800
Diego, what content do you
have for us to do that?

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,290
- All right, uh, well, I've
brought my sketchbook here.

31
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,040
And of course I also brought
different pencils and pens.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,790
(zipper opening)

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,350
Let's see what we got here.

34
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,393
I've got Sharpies.

35
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,840
Pens.

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,563
My favorite is always gonna
be number two graphite.

37
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,103
So it's already fairly sharp.

38
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:56,293
But, uh, I think for the
purpose of this demo,

39
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,636
I'm gonna sharpen it a little bit.

40
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:00,956
- All right.

41
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,180
- My lovely wife has made this

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,170
beautiful pencil shavings
receptacle for me to use.

43
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,425
- That's great.

44
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:10,310
- When I need to sharpen my pencil.

45
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,567
So this out of the way.

46
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,370
- How interesting, so you use a knife

47
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,630
to sharpen your pencil, do you?

48
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,180
- Yeah, I like my knives,
and I use whatever excuse

49
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,675
I could come up with to
use them for more things.

50
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,375
(knife scraping on pencil)

51
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:30,040
Also, uh, you kind of lose a little bit

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,750
less graphite by doing it this way,

53
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,500
than by using a standard sharpener.

54
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:38,324
There you go.

55
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,074
(paper rustling)

56
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:58,130
(slurping tea)

57
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,510
- So Diego, what will you
be drawing for us today?

58
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,480
- Uh, so I'm not actually
gonna be drawing,

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,870
I'm gonna be writing
down a series of jokes,

60
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,994
maybe some puns.

61
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:09,940
- Okay.

62
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,020
- Um, I get a lot of comments

63
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,961
for saying dad jokes, typically.

64
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:21,530
Though I'm not a dad of a person,

65
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,880
I'm only, you could call
me a dad of a small dog.

66
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,780
- Yeah.
- Who's amazing.

67
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,906
I mean, I like to think it's witty humor.

68
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:32,210
Um, but yeah, this'll be interesting.

69
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,170
I'm not typically a type of person

70
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,920
to just memorize jokes.

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,251
- Yeah, yeah, I know
you're very off the cuff.

72
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,517
- I am very off the cuff.

73
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:40,842
- With your jokes.

74
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:43,610
So hopefully, we could, we could develop

75
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,990
some kind of groove here, it'd be nice.

76
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,150
- Okay.

77
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,803
Here we go.
- So, get started.

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,310
Kind of riff on something we said earlier.

79
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,660
- Okay.
- Let's see, uh...

80
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,010
- I believe good writing sounds

81
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,510
are always important for an ASMR video.

82
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,010
Let us know in the comments below

83
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,210
how we're doing, you know?

84
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,368
I mean, as you all know, I enjoy

85
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:09,450
constructive criticism of all kinds,

86
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,330
so in the comments below, let us know

87
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,541
how I can improve the ASMR video.

88
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,373
We'll go from there.

89
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:24,730
I am being told to eat a cracker.

90
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:30,077
(plastic crinkling)

91
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,953
Oh, it's a graham cracker.

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,570
- [Diego] I feel like I need to cover it

93
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,722
so you can't see what I'm writing.

94
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,972
(laughing)

95
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:56,935
(eating graham cracker)

96
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:03,323
- Oh, these are good, I haven't had

97
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,060
a graham cracker in a long time.

98
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,007
So this is actually quite nice.

99
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,257
(laughing)

100
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:16,635
(eating graham cracker)

101
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,063
(brushing table rhythmically)

102
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:44,547
- Maybe I'll come back to this.

103
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,158
Good practice, okay.

104
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:50,825
(tearing paper)

105
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,980
- Sometimes it takes a minute

106
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,505
for inspiration to come.

107
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:01,338
- It does.

108
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,490
- Writing a quality dad joke is like

109
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,100
any work of art, you know?

110
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,910
It takes time.

111
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,864
Commitment to your writing style.

112
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:16,280
Delivery is very important.

113
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,770
I am concerned that, in my
delivery of Diego's dad joke,

114
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,114
I may not give you the
true essence of the humor

115
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:27,069
in my voice, so, you know.

116
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:29,469
We'll see how this goes.

117
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:30,439
- That's good.

118
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,272
(paper crumpling)

119
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,027
All right.

120
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:41,860
(paper crumpling)

121
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,053
Okay.

122
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:50,810
(laughing)

123
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,233
Okay, sorry, okay.

124
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,338
I had, okay, here we go, here we go,

125
00:06:58,338 --> 00:06:59,960
we're gonna do it, here's the joke.

126
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,204
Scene.

127
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:04,550
I had an idea for an
international garment store

128
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,870
that sells things like robes and gowns

129
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,120
from all sorts of places.

130
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,520
I'd call it Sari, Not Sari.

131
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,353
(paper crumpling)

132
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,802
Sari is spelled S-A-R-I.

133
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,563
That's why it's funny.

134
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:30,078
- Okay.

135
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:32,001
At least I know how you get that.

136
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,195
- I appreciate it.

137
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:36,445
(laughing)

138
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:42,350
Okay.

139
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,360
We definitely bit off
more than we could chew

140
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,359
with this idea, but, you know,

141
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:50,530
I'm happy to go through
it with y'all together.

142
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,583
So, this is Diego and Tiffany's kitchen.

143
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,778
Uh, yeah.

144
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:57,730
(laughing)

145
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,689
This is your kitchen.

146
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:02,560
- It's the back part, we don't cook here.

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,226
- Yeah, this is the
back part of the kitchen

148
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:05,059
that they don't cook at.

149
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:06,621
This is the part where they eat.

150
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,817
(laughing)

151
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:09,946
Oh God.

152
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:13,440
You might call it a dining room.

153
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,790
- Dining nook, maybe.

154
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,430
- Dining nook.

155
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,112
And this table is from IKEA.

156
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,090
It's a really cool table, actually.

157
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,990
I really want one.

158
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,928
And on this table I am
having some lovely...

159
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:30,080
(cup scraping across table)

160
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,510
Tea that Tiffany brewed
for me for this video.

161
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,093
(slurping tea)

162
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,106
It's very nice.

163
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:43,964
It's a beautiful Sunday
here in Austin, Texas.

164
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:48,330
We actually used to live,
they were our neighbors

165
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,164
when we lived here in Austin.

166
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:53,110
And as you all know, we now live

167
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,060
in San Antonio, but we
come up to visit them,

168
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,357
and they come down to visit us

169
00:08:57,357 --> 00:09:00,524
whenever they can, when there's time.

170
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,930
So it's a lovely relationship.

171
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,308
We have a long-distance friendship.

172
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:06,763
But it's great.

173
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,515
- A classic Diego special.

174
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:14,182
(paper tearing)

175
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:25,371
(cup scraping across table)

176
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:28,204
(paper crumpling)

177
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:36,840
- Thank you, sir.

178
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:41,532
(paper crumpling)

179
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:55,320
(laughing)

180
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,237
Okay, okay.

181
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,653
This is so bad.

182
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,063
Why is Go-Gurt not
popular as a health food?

183
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,883
It's a little off-pudding.

184
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,194
Pudding, like P-U-D-D-I-N-G,
pudding that way.

185
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,027
Pudding.

186
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,665
(paper tearing)

187
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:28,827
Do you wanna?

188
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,664
(paper crumpling)

189
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:40,759
Thank you.

190
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,173
(paper crumpling)

191
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:49,349
All right.

192
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:56,302
All right.

193
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,453
Okay.

194
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,400
So these are all, like,
before we tell this dad joke.

195
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,090
These are all restaurant
ideas, essentially,

196
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,033
that you have?

197
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,380
- We do think of restaurants a lot.

198
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,213
- Okay.

199
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:09,460
- Me and Tiffany.

200
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,370
- Yeah.

201
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,203
- We like food.

202
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,416
- Okay, yeah.

203
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,163
- I think more than other people do.

204
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:16,283
- I don't know, that might not be true.

205
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:17,920
- No, but it's interesting
to see just, like,

206
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
what motivates you, you know?

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,833
- It does.

208
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,790
- To have a good dad joke.

209
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,250
And these are all very restaurant-themed.

210
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,083
I like it, okay.

211
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,543
So here we go.

212
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,370
I like the idea of a sandwich shop

213
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,880
whose mission is to set the standard

214
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,781
by which sandwiches are made.

215
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:37,803
Best sauces, best meats, best baguettes.

216
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:41,313
I would it call it The Sub Standard.

217
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:45,014
(paper crumpling)

218
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:48,652
I like that one.

219
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:49,756
I like it.

220
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:50,631
- It's the standard.

221
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:51,464
- I like that there's--
- The Sub Standard

222
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:52,841
- Yeah, I like that there's a back story

223
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,598
- You get a true essence of, you know?

224
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:55,765
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:58,142 --> 00:12:02,632
(cup scraping across table)

226
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:05,215
(slurping tea)

227
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,113
Uh, in the comments below.

228
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,240
Let me know if you are an ASMR enthusiast,

229
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,810
if you dabble in creating ASMR content.

230
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,780
Let me know what audio situation,

231
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,300
what your setup is looking like for ASMR.

232
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,130
I have taken a very film approach

233
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,407
to this setup.

234
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:31,556
As you all know, I studied film at UT.

235
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:34,122
And I took some audio engineering classes

236
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:38,670
based around mixing for film,

237
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,400
but so much of this is auditory that

238
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,070
I feel like there's an aspect to this

239
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,580
I may be missing, so you know,

240
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,730
lemme know what microphones systems

241
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,073
you're using, you know,
are you using mixers

242
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:49,593
when you do this?

243
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,400
Just lemme know, in the comments below.

244
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,310
I'd be curious to see, you know,

245
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,830
let's talk tech, you know?

246
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,573
Let's talk tech for ASMR, you know?

247
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,250
Damn.

248
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:09,397
(tea pouring)

249
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,233
Thank you.

250
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,470
This, I just wanna say this video

251
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,425
is definitely a family affair production.

252
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,890
We have Mr. Hallease in the back

253
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,620
helping run the cameras.

254
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,009
We also have Tiffany, Diego's wife,

255
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:31,920
helping run the cameras,
and pouring tea as well.

256
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,392
So, you know.

257
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,420
This is a labor of love, definitely.

258
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,283
The four of us coming together.

259
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,750
Like, share, and subscribe.

260
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,464
If you haven't already.

261
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,714
(laughing)

262
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,470
Like, share, and, I never say that.

263
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,303
In any of my videos.

264
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:51,563
Like, share, and subscribe.

265
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,023
For more.

266
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,830
- This one's a hard one because

267
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,020
there's already one pun in it
that I think is really good.

268
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,000
- Okay.
- But I feel like

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,160
to make it really work, the second half

270
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,510
has to also be a pun.

271
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,374
- Okay.

272
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:08,638
So it sounds--

273
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:10,453
- It's just, ah man.

274
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:11,310
- Yeah, it sounds like
you're actually trying

275
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,310
to up your own ante a
little bit, you know?

276
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:17,202
- Maybe.

277
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:18,035
- Yeah.

278
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,400
I appreciate that, you know.

279
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,106
It's always good to strive for more.

280
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:26,689
(slurping tea)

281
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,110
- Yeah, I think with humor,
as in anything creative,

282
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,930
it's important to explore
the possibilities.

283
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,620
You might start with something small.

284
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,453
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:45,060
- And, you know, when you
first kind of put it out there

286
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,410
in a form, sometimes, like it sparks.

287
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,147
Something creative that
says, like, oh man, like.

288
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:53,240
And you see people do this a lot.

289
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,190
Somebody says something, and
everybody else just kind of...

290
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,770
- Yeah.
- Kind of building into it.

291
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,224
- Definitely, definitely.

292
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:01,950
- But yeah, part of it, too, is just.

293
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,130
It's the best I can make this joke.

294
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,963
- Yeah, I know it.

295
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:05,253
I totally get that, yeah.

296
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:08,479
All right, good.

297
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,240
(crumpling paper)

298
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,667
While Diego is meditating
on his dad joke--

299
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,860
- Yeah, could, it might help me focus.

300
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,754
- Okay.

301
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:17,587
(crumpling paper)

302
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,408
- [Diego] I just realized
I've been advertising

303
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,991
Buckethead IPA this whole time.

304
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,554
(crumpling paper)

305
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,003
Oh, it's not as nice a sound as I thought.

306
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,834
Do you mind if I rip your dad joke?

307
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:46,709
(laughing)

308
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,022
You do, you do, I won't
do it, I won't do it.

309
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,174
- That was a dad joke!

310
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:52,241
- What was he?

311
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,230
- [Tiffany] Don't rip your dad joke.

312
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,318
- Ripping my jokes!

313
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,568
(laughing)

314
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:03,013
- Oh, that's terrible.

315
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,871
An unforeseen, like,
really hard thing to do,

316
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:09,023
is laugh quietly.

317
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,347
This is really hard to laugh quietly.

318
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,180
I'm just gonna throw that over here.

319
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,013
- [Diego] I don't even know if

320
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:16,010
we're necessarily being quiet.

321
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,160
- I don't think we are.

322
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,982
In the comments below...

323
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:21,040
(laughing)

324
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,480
It's all about engagement on YouTube.

325
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,970
In the comments below, let us know

326
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,967
if we're being quiet enough.

327
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,217
(laughing)

328
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,084
(scratching paper)

329
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:35,690
Yeah.

330
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,002
- Okay.
- Oh, we got one?

331
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,959
- I think I have to pinch this one off.

332
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,754
- Okay, go ahead.

333
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:42,587
(tearing paper)

334
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,141
- This one rips differently.

335
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:44,974
- Yeah.

336
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,237
- Oh.

337
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:50,393
It ripped the wrong way.

338
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:52,643
(laughing)

339
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:02,636
(crumpling paper)

340
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,726
We'll call this one a work in progress.

341
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,941
- Okay.

342
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,955
I think after this one we'll do one more,

343
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:13,081
and I feel like we'll have a video.

344
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:14,525
- Oh, that's not bad.

345
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,640
- It's attached, my bad.

346
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,473
(crumpling paper)

347
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,120
I notice some of the new cars these days

348
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,280
don't sell quite as well
as the outgoing models.

349
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,873
I think it's because they
still haven't gotten out much.

350
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,645
(crumpling paper)

351
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:52,080
- Maybe someone will get it.

352
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,382
(laughing)

353
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:55,903
- I think somebody's gonna get it.

354
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:59,865
I think a car enthusiast
will love that joke.

355
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:01,266
- Yeah, we'll let that one sit for awhile.

356
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,141
- Yeah.

357
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,974
(scraping pencil)

358
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,335
- Just so I can write
nice tiny, tiny letters.

359
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,410
- There's nothing more, you know,

360
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:19,410
important than a nice,
sharp pencil, I find.

361
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,940
Whenever I decide to use a pencil.

362
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:28,280
(laughing)

363
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,430
It's been awhile since I've
used a pencil, actually.

364
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,060
I just realized that.

365
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,983
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

366
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:38,473
(cup scraping across table)

367
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:41,056
(ice clinking)

368
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,529
So we're on our last
dad joke for the video.

369
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,480
And, uh, you know, creative
tensions are high over here.

370
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,972
I'm just gonna say that, because...

371
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:56,910
- Yeah, this is true.

372
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,830
- I feel like we've had some
pretty great ones so far,

373
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,640
and so you wanna end it on a good note.

374
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,010
But, I'm not gonna lie, I feel

375
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,738
a little creatively drained, actually.

376
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,988
(laughing)

377
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,510
While you're doing that,
I'm gonna experiment

378
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,936
with moving this cup
across the table a lot.

379
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,978
(cup scraping across table)

380
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:17,860
In the comments below, let me know

381
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,307
if that's working for y'all.

382
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,557
(laughing)

383
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,350
And there you go.

384
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,170
Also, if you're a dad joke enthusiast,

385
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,080
and you would like your
dad joke maybe featured

386
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,161
on the next video, in the comments below,

387
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,210
hit us with your best dad joke.

388
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,222
We'd love to read it and
possibly incorporate it.

389
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:49,200
- Doesn't even have to be the best,

390
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,033
as long as it's entertaining.

391
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,220
- You know, yeah, yeah.

392
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,330
Yeah, that's a good point.

393
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,950
I mean, obviously you're working through

394
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,050
a creative process over there.

395
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,283
Um, when you're trying
to think of a dad joke,

396
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,634
from scratch, I mean, it's
easy to riff off people, right?

397
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,355
- Yeah.

398
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:14,350
I think the thing about really good humor

399
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,872
is that it has to come
from life, you know?

400
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:17,705
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

401
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:20,253
- The more relatable it is for somebody,

402
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,280
you know, the more kind of
inviting and friendly it becomes.

403
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,990
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

404
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,837
- Sometimes people joke about
things nobody knows about.

405
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:33,000
It's easy for that to get lost.

406
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,230
- Yeah, yeah.

407
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,158
- So that's why I'm really
glad you enjoyed the sari joke.

408
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:40,408
(laughing)

409
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:45,204
Not that we wear saris on a regular basis.

410
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,037
- Right.

411
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,063
- Or at all.
- Right.

412
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,110
- But we have friends who do.

413
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,161
- Yeah.

414
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,121
No, I totally get that.

415
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:56,080
So were you concerned that I, like,

416
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,200
would not understand
that part of the joke?

417
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,730
The sari?
- Um.

418
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,440
Less with you.
- Oh, okay.

419
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,010
- I think I've tried it with other people,

420
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,800
and it was a little bit lost on 'em.

421
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,773
- Yeah, okay, yeah.

422
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,246
Expand your world view.

423
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:11,470
- So if you don't know
what a sari is, look it up.

424
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,957
- Yeah.

425
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:14,750
It was a good joke.

426
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,433
It was, it might have been my favorite.

427
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,607
It might have been, actually.

428
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:24,294
- This one's pretty classically dumb.

429
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:25,712
(laughing)

430
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:26,983
- Okay.

431
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:33,735
(bouncing paper)

432
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,107
(tearing paper)

433
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:03,455
(crumpling paper)

434
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:06,762
You done?

435
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,512
Oh.

436
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,095
You packed this one
pretty tight, actually.

437
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:14,415
- Oh.

438
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:15,550
(laughing)

439
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,573
- So simple.

440
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,253
How do you make a burger too stale?

441
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:23,513
Use old buns.

442
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,540
Went out on a pin with that one.

443
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,956
- That's our second sandwich joke.

444
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:35,067
- That is our second sandwich joke.

445
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:37,550
(laughing)

446
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,723
All right.

447
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,668
Well, ladies and gentlemen.

448
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:46,668
This has been an attempt at ASMR by me.

449
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:50,040
Thank you so much, Diego, for providing

450
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,867
the content for this ASMR video.

451
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:55,270
Like we said, in the comments below,

452
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,910
let us know how you felt about this.

453
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,580
(laughing)

454
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,930
In general.

455
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,913
Constructive criticism
is always appreciated

456
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:08,140
on this channel, and let
me know if you would like

457
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,160
to see more ASMR videos.

458
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,536
With or without Diego.

459
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:13,853
Preferably with, I think preferably with.

460
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:14,686
- I enjoyed being here.

461
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:15,838
- Yeah, I hope you did.

462
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:18,290
And, uh, I'll see you when I see you.

463
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,305
Diego, would you like to?

464
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:22,100
- Uh.
- Say your goodbyes.

465
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,410
- I don't know if I have much to add.

466
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,050
I appreciate being on the video.

467
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,720
I enjoyed my time here, and I
hope you all enjoyed it, too.

468
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,010
- All right, see you when we see you.

469
00:23:30,010 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
