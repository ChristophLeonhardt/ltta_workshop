00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:12,515
I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH

9
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:13,149
KIM JONG UN.

10
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:14,684
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING.

11
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:16,186
I CAN NOW -- WAIT.

12
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:17,520
I CAN NOW CALL HIM.

13
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,990
I CAN NOW SAY WELL, WE HAVE A

14
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,323
PROBLEM.

15
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:22,158
I TOLD HIM, I GAVE HIM A VERY

16
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:23,293
DIRECT NUMBER.

17
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:25,495
HE CAN NOW CALL ME IF HE HAS ANY

18
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:25,895
DIFFICULTY.

19
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,030
I CAN CALL HIM.

20
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,298
WE HAVE COMMUNICATION.

21
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:29,466
IT'S A VERY GOOD THING.

22
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:30,467
PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED THAT THIS IS

23
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:31,901
THE KIND OF -- THEY THOUGHT

24
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,803
TRUMP WAS GOING TO GET IN AND

25
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:35,105
START THROWING BOMBS ALL OVER

26
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:35,538
THE PLACE.

27
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:38,341
IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE.

28
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:39,376
>> ERIC: THAT'S PRESIDENT ON THE

37
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:53,857
THIS OF COURSE FOLLOWS THE

38
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:54,991
HISTORIC SUMMIT WITH THE NORTH

39
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,260
KOREAN DICTATOR.

40
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,828
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO

41
00:00:58,828 --> 00:01:00,163
SAYS A LOT OF WORK HAS TO BE

42
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:02,098
DONE WITH THE REGIME INCLUDING

43
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:03,900
BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY ITS

44
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,136

>> WE HAVE A REASONABLE

46
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:09,906
UNDERSTANDING.

47
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,808
IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT

48
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:13,309
WE GET A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF

49
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:15,945
THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND

50
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,847
AS PART OF THE EFFORTS THAT WILL

51
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:21,384
BE UNDERTAKEN IN THE WEEKS

52
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:21,718
AHEAD.

53
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:23,853
WE WILL WORK WITH THE NORTH

54
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:26,156
KOREANS TO COME TO HAVE A FULLER

55
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,425
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT SO THAT WE

56
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:29,125
CAN BEGIN TO EXECUTE TOGETHER

57
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,827
THE COMMITMENTS THAT PRESIDENT

58
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:33,630
TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN KIM MADE.

59
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,865
>> ERIC: WE HAVE A REASONABLE

60
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:40,203
UNDERSTANDING, NOT A FULL ONE.

61

SECURITY ADVISOR.

62
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:43,273
THIS IS WHERE THE RUBBER HITS

63
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:44,040
THE ROAD.

64
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,609
ARE WE GOING TO GET CONCRETE

65
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,644
MOVES, SPECIFIC STEPS BY THE

66
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:49,646
NORTH KOREANS TO OPEN THE

67
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:51,581
NUCLEAR SITES TO INTERNATIONAL

68
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,616
INSPECTORS AND START THE PROCESS

69
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,952
AS IS PLEDGED OF

70
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:56,553
DENUCLEARIZATION?

71
00:01:56,553 --> 00:02:00,056
>> THAT'S THE $64,000 QUESTION,

72
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:00,490
ERIC.

73
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,225
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR 25 YEARS

74
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:03,927
WITH THE NORTH.

75
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:05,628
WE'VE HAD LOTS OF STATEMENTS IN

76
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:09,566
THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HA

77
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:09,598
THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HE

78
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:09,698
THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HD

00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:09,732
THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HI

00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:10,032
THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HN

81
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:12,402
THAT DIRECTION, A VERIFIED,

82
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:13,236
COMPLETE, IRREVERSIBLE

83
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,070
DENUCLEARIZATION AND YET WE

84
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,004
NEVER GET THERE.

85
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,006
THE PROMISE OF WHAT THE

86
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,741
PRESIDENT DID THIS WEEK IS THAT

87
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:21,444
HE ESTABLISHED THIS PERSONAL

88
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:23,012
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN.

89
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,914
THAT'S SOMETHING DRAMATICALLY

90
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:25,215
NEW.

91
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:27,650
BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T YET

92
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,352
ACTUALLY ADVANCED THE BALL ON

93
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:30,653
THIS GOAL THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT

94
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:32,889
TO THE UNITED STATES OF

95
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,389
DENUCLEARIZATION.

96
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,024
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT

97
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,427
SECRETARY POMPEO HAS GOT TO GET

98
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:38,461
AFTER AND I THINK HE NEEDS TO

99
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,096
GET AFTER IT VERY QUICKLY.

100
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,031
WE'VE GOT TO SEE SOME RESULTS ON

101
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,467
WHAT WE NEED FROM NORTH KOREA

102
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:46,069
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

103
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,203
>> ERIC: WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO

104
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:47,470
SEE?

105
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,105
>> WELL, I THINK THE FIRST THING

106
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:50,840
WE'VE GOT TO -- I WOULD LIKE TO

107
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,776
SIMPLY SEE A DECLARATION FROM

108
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,813
CHAIRMAN KIM TO HIS PEOPLE IN

109
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,448
KOREAN THAT AT THE END OF THIS

110
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:00,250
PROCESS WITH THE UNITED STATES,

111
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,785
HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES, IN

112
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,622
EXCHANGE FOR VIABLE SECURITY AND

113
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:06,923
ECONOMIC GUARANTEES FROM THE

114
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:08,858
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, NORTH

115
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:12,195
KOREA WILL HAVE NO NUCLEAR

116
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:16,132
PROGRAM WHATSOEVER OR BALLISTIC

117
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:16,699
MISSILE PROGRAM.

118
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:17,934
AFTER THAT, I THINK THEY'VE GOT

119
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:19,869
TO COME CLEAN WITH A FULL

120
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:22,105
DECLARATION OF WHAT THEY'VE GOT

121
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:24,941
BECAUSE AS SECRETARY BOMB POI

122
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,377
YOW SAYS WE DON'T -- POMPEO

123
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:28,811
SAYS, WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER

124
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,948
THEY'VE GOT 10 NUCLEAR WEAPONS

125
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:32,615
OR 60 NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

126
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:34,250
THAT'S THE DRAMATIC VARIANCE WE

127
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,785
HAVE IN UNDERSTANDING THE FULL

128
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:37,287
SCOPE AND BREADTH OF THIS

129
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:38,421
NUCLEAR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE

130
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,455
NORTH HAS BUILT UP.

131
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,491
SO WE FIRST HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR

132
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:42,792
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'VE

133
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:43,793
GOT, THEN WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE

134
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:46,329
TO GET IN THERE WITH OUR

135
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,264

ACTUALLY HAND THAT OVER OR THAT

154
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,917

THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR, THEY'LL

156
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,191
JUST SPIN AND WAIT AND DELAY,

THAT'S EXACTLY THE PATH THAT

162
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:25,501
WE'RE HEADED ON.

163
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:27,637
THAT IS THE DANGER OF THE

164
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:29,072

165
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:30,974
THAT THE NORTH AS IN THE PAST

166
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:32,809
WILL SIMPLY PLAY FOR TIME,

167
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,510
THEY'LL REDUCE THEIR

168
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,545
INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION, AND

169
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,146
GRADUALLY THEY WILL BEGIN WITH

170
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:40,817
THIS CHARM OFFENSIVE TO ERODE

171
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:41,484
THE INTERNATIONAL SANCTION

172
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:43,219
THAT'S THE CHINESE, THE SOUTH

173
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,655
KOREANS, THE RUSSIANS WILL ALL

174
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:47,991
BEGIN TO DROP OFF IN TERMS OF

THEIR ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS

176
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,727
AND THEN THE NORTH OVER TIME

177
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:53,963
WILL BE FREE AND CLEAR TO

ECONOMIC CONCESSIONS.

181
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:59,035
THE HOPE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT

182
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:01,337
HAS DONE IS THAT THEY HAVE GOT

183
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:04,407
TO DELIVER A COMPLETE AND FINAL

184
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,643
DECLARATION OF THE FULL SCOPE OF

185
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:08,011

UNITED STATES AND OUR OTHER

187
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,681
