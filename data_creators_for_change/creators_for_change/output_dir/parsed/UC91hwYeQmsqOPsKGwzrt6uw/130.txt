and vocal pres money okay is that a deal
boot here with that this one's hon oh
I'll take it that I accept that thank
you thank you so much I we're on our way
there
yeah we'll see how it goes I'm feeling a
little bit nervous like I'm freaking
hiding with an old flame or something
not that I've ever done that before I
can imagine it might be when it's gonna
fly so anyways yes you hi
are you ready to get the card back yeah
hey Rosie right I want to say hi mom you
wanna say nice hi
so they're putting new plates on the car
right now I'm walking away because I
feel awkward talking to my camera
what is definitely much better than I am
a meanwhile hechos is very resistant
I've done that one
what I do it again yeah long time no see
it's all nice and clean okay traction
with that but they replace the stereo
not the one we had but it'll do they fix
the thing the feeling that was an
out-of-pocket expense insurance did not
cover that
it looks pretty clean here
the seat is a top story
Arlo's way that it doesn't smell like
most anymore it does have a smell but it
doesn't smell like smoke and they still
have this crap back here now that's
creepy I don't really know what to do
about this I totally thought
I'm going to let Glenn Guist us out
ah what's wrong with you baby
here
I know you're tired just go to sleep
please
what do you want
I've done all you ask you're fed I'll
change the diaper
here I'm fine I just got in the car and
I'm pulling off now
okay by way of your collar just yeah I'm
coming right now
okay so
I don't know that I have had the
opportunity to personally face our
imaginary art are we calling citing the
imaginary friends internet friends I
don't know everyone but you are an
extension of the Henry family and I just
want to say thank you when the car got
stolen and you guys found out there was
like no hesitation for someone to start
a girlfriend
Paige which I gotta be honest before
this whole thing
I personally it was not a big like
GoFundMe prices like I don't I don't I
have mixed feelings about the whole
concept but you guys started it you
raise funds for us and that was awesome
and we still plan to use that money to
get a car hopefully this weekend
actually because you do need a car still
but um this whole experience has been
very interesting because in my opinion I
so like and we have this insurance for
at least seven years confirm and I have
been married for almost seven years and
we've never gotten into the maximun and
we've ever needed anything like major
from our insurance so it's kind of like
we're paying this bill every month and
what is that money going towards just so
dirty I don't know I'll even go the
mises right now but what I'm saying is I
feel like my insurance company should
have taken better care of me like I
shouldn't have had to come out of pocket
any amount of money like the decibel
should go away for good behavior
if that's the thing and so the fact that
we had to pay anything and this whole
experience has kind of tripped me out a
little bit but the fact remains that we
didn't come out of pocket any like our
livelihood was not inconvenient at all
because you guys better set such that
you could cover the cost
of everything that had to be taken care
of getting our house Ricci because I
left my keys in the car getting a new
stroller having to pay extra for the
rental car when our insurance company
decided that they would no longer cover
the rental even though our car was still
being taken care of okay if I was a
dollar decibel plus them so I just want
to say thank you because I haven't had
my own opportunity to personally say
thank you and if I could like give each
and every single one of you guys who
contributed and prayed for us or
whatever a hug
I would totally totally do that but
anyway I just wanted to thank you while
it feels weird to be back in this car
it's still good like to have my
suspicions back
I can't wait to get that crap out of
that truck I don't even want to touch it
anyways thank you guys for your pears
thank you for your contribution thank
you for your comments on social media
your messages that you've sent you guys
are such the art and I appreciate you
from the bottom of my heart so thank you
and hopefully the next time
we will be using the rest of the Sun
put towards a new part because we all
know that machineries are busting that
the scene in this car so
cuz I be the glory and see you all thank
you

car oh no love NOLA they still got this
dude scrapping my freaking car does it
stink in there
