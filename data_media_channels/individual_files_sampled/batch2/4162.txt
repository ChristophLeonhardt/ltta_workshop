Donald Trump has used public attacks to drive all kinds of senior people out of federal law enforcement he didn't personally fire the number two FBI official Andrew McCabe or the investigator Peter struck who was terminated from the FBI just yesterday but he set the scene and he's at it again today saying his hand-picked nominee jeff Sessions is not a quote real Attorney General part of a long-term strategy to undermine or out him an out-of-control livid president called the Attorney General sitting there in the Oval Office with him an idiot and demanded his resignation on the spot the president called him beleaguered and slammed his AG here again you have the president saying asking where is Attorney General Jeff Sessions and all of this he then attacks Jeff Sessions the Attorney General by saying this our AG is scared stiff and missing in action why does the president continue to do this why is he attacking his own attorney general Trump wanted sessions to stay involved in the Russia probe so he could control it and protect the president after all without the sessions recusal there may not have ever been a full-throated Muller probe so you have sessions McCabe Comey they are all also witnesses in this Muller probe as well in fact my colleague Rachel Maddow noting that the heat on other corroborating witnesses is real Comey has back up right call me with his FBI training committed the president's exact words he says to writing right after that conversation happened and then he told all these people crucially at the time so they can corroborate what Comey said at the time about what happened right well it's taken them a little while to get all the way through this list but the only ones still there is David Bowdich once you work your way through all the witnesses who might testify otherwise well then of course you're free to tell any story you want about what happened between the president and the FBI director and if all of the cooperating witnesses have been picked up and blown up who's left to say what happened there at all who's left to say otherwise now I'm joined now by California congressman Eric swallow who served in the and Judiciary Committee's and Michael McFaul former US ambassador to Russia congressman your view of these attacks on sessions and whether they're part of a coordinated effort to not only get the kind of leadership he wants but as Rachel and others have pointed out to also undercut potential witnesses a good evening re to me it suggests that President Trump is running out of new ideas and new ways to obstruct this investigation he's just going back to the old trope of attacking attorney General Sessions I think this is because you know the walls are closing in a crucial decision point awaits him will he testify to Bob Muller or won't he and I think in desperation he's trying to make the investigation go away what really worries me though Ari is that the the deafening silence from Republicans people who serve with Jeff Sessions who are just saying nothing and allowing this president to continue to try and obstruct the investigation and that they will do nothing to speak up and defend it I wonder ambassador how you think it all relates to the fact that Donald Trump's only consistent vector is whether someone is being helpful or hurtful to him and his own estimation a story that we don't have in our rundown tonight because there's not much to it is the ongoing Omarosa feud but there is an overlap in the sense that Jeff Sessions has received different treatment from Trump only based on whether he's doing things that Trump things are good for him personally not for the country not for the DOJ not for policy here's a Donald Trump's past history with sessions Jeff is an amazing man and working with him I know we will make these incredible strides that our country has to make in restoring safety and justice for all of our people he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get Senator Jeff Sessions one of the great men one of the most highly respected men in the United States Senate how does that figure into the way people view these new attacks well it just suggests that everything's about loyalty to the president it suggests that it's nothing about the of law or checks and balances or the oath that all those individuals take to the United States of America and not to the president you know I served at the White House for three years with President Obama and two things are strikingly different one is just how many people he's turned against right and when you have so many people that have resigned or he's turned against the president that makes everybody nervous about working for this president today and the second thing is you know I remember January 21st 2009 we all put our hands up and we took an oath to the United States of America we didn't take an oath to President Obama or Vice President Biden and that fundamental difference I just don't think President Trump understands and congressman I want to read from a Republican who makes an interesting observation about this unique role that Jeff Sessions finds himself in as a beleaguered recused Attorney General in Russia it says perhaps sessions is single-handedly keeping America from falling into an unprecedented state of lawlessness he's fully aware the turmoil that would be caused if he resigned Reince Priebus and others have talked about how he did consider resigning most people in this situation wouldn't want to keep working and yet and yet he's decided to stay what do you think that says about Jeff Sessions and about the limits on Donald Trump who who brags and boasts that he doesn't follow any rules that no one can make him do anything and he is now the president and yet he doesn't have to tweet about it he would be able today to fire Jeff Sessions if he chose to clearly there's something holding him back I wonder what you think that is yeah well Ari let's not give Jeff Sessions too much credit here because he after all did have undisclosed contacts with the Russians and he gets to stay and do what he's always wanted to do which is to tear apart families deport immigrants separate children at the border and prioritize the enforcement of marijuana prosecution so I don't want to you know give this guy a parade just yet I also say that holding a very powerful job isn't itself a sacrifice right and I also would hope that if he were fired the Senate would not confirm an attorney general who would end the Moller investigation so again that I think the reason Donald Trump is not firing him is he is very in touch with poll numbers and popularity contests and he knows that it would be wildly unpopular and it would be direct to impeachment proceedings and I don't think he wants to go there you think that although Donald Trump claims to go in all directions on this he's actually testing and he thinks or he's come under the fear that to go that far to remove sessions to try to get an unwritten general to kneecap the probe itself you think would actually lead to impeachment especially this close to the election yes hmm ambassador that's the I don't have a good answer to that question it seems to me that he knows that his options of firing him I mean your point Ari he has the presidential authority to do that that he chooses not to suggest that he doesn't have a plan B and maybe he's just stuck with the current equilibrium that he's put himself in but the tragedy of all this is is the rule of law is the respect for the United States government's the institutions that normally don't behave in this way and normally a president of the United States does not talk about his Attorney General in the way that President Trump does today certainly not and so it both shows what he's doing that's concerned so many people and that Bullard may ultimately use his evidence and also the limits on him that something may be working if he understands there are limits to some degree congressman Eric's well and ambassador McFaul thank you both hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right
