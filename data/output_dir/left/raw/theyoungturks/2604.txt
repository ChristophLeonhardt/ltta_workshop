1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,621
A LOT OF THIS
INFORMATION BREAKING IN JUST THE

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:10,050
HOUR OR TWO BEFORE WE WENT LIVE,
BUT DEVIN NUNES TODAY SAYS THAT

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:17,190
BECAUSE FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW
AT LEAST, THE FBI IS CURRENTLY

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,540
UNDER INVESTIGATION BY HIS
COMMITTEE, BECAUSE THEY ARE

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:34,500
UNDER INVESTIGATION NO ONE FROM
THE FBI CAN BE USED TO BRIEF THE

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,700
COMMITTEE ON ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT DOSSIERS OR ANY OTHER

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,700
INFORMATION.

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,410
SO IT'S KIND OF A
GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD AND

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,990
THE FBI PROVIDING INFORMATION
WHERE HE'S JUST SAYING ALL OF

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,380
YOU ARE SUSPECT SO YOU CAN'T BE
USED ANYMORE.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,990
I DON'T SEE THAT

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,760
PLAYING OUT THE WAY HE PLANS BUT
THAT'S HIS GOAL AT LEAST TODAY,

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,790
TO STONEWALL THE FBI FROM BEING
INVOLVED IN ANY OF THESE

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,030
INVESTIGATIONS.

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,470
WE ALSO FOUND
OUT EARLIER TODAY, I BELIEVE

16
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,400
THIS WAS A CNN BREAKING NEWS
STORY, THAT BACK IN DECEMBER

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:16,381
DONALD TRUMP HAD A CONVERSATION
WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN WHERE HE

18
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:21,570
ASKED HIM IF HE WAS, QUOTE, ON
MY TEAM, WHICH ISN'T THE SAME

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,370
THING AS ASKING FOR A LOYALTY
PLEDGE, WHICH HE FAMOUSLY DID

20
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,790
WITH JAMES COMEY, BUT IT'S IN
THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,790
>>YEAH.

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,990
>>ROD ROSENSTEIN SAID IN HIS
TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS THAT HE

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,460
HADN'T BEEN ASKED TO TAKE PART
IN ANY SORT OF LOYALTY PLEDGE,

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,321
SO IT APPEARS HE DIDN'T PERCEIVE
IT THAT WAY EITHER, BUT FROM A

25
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:49,280
GUY LIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHO WE
KNOW IS VERY INTERESTED IN

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,900
LOYALTY, I THINK THAT'S NOT
NOTHING.

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,250
>>A COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS
THERE.

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,250
ON ROD ROSENSTEIN'S

29
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,840
TESTIMONY, HE POINTEDLY REFUSED
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,500
WHETHER HE HAD BEEN ASKED ABOUT
LOYALTY.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,680
BUT THEN WENT ON TO

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,330
SAY, WELL, I DIDN'T GIVE A
LOYALTY PLEDGE.

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,030
SO THAT WOULD

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,500
MAKE THIS STORY NOW FIT INTO
THAT TESTIMONY, WHICH IS ALREADY

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,630
ON THE RECORD.

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:17,310
SO IT TURNS OUT
DONALD TRUMP SAID ARE YOU ON MY

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,460
TEAM, AGAIN ASKING FOR LOYALTY,
AND ROSENSTEIN IN HIS

38
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,030
INTERPRETATION DIDN'T GIVE THAT
PLEDGE.

39
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,700
>>
HE DID SAY HE WAS ON HIS TEAM --

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,410
OR HE'S ON THE TEAM, I THINK HE
SAID.

41
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,220
>>THE REPORT SAID THAT IT WAS AN
AWKWARD SITUATION, WHICH IT MOST

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,360
CERTAINLY IS, BECAUSE HE'S PART
OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH RUN BY

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,620
DONALD TRUMP, AND HE SAID, MR.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,760
PRESIDENT, WE ARE ALL PART OF

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
THE SAME TEAM.

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
RIGHT?

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,110
I MEAN, TO
GIVE THE GUY CREDIT, WHAT CAN

48
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,210
YOU SAY IN A SITUATION LIKE
THAT?

49
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,210
PISS OFF?

50
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,210
YOU CAN'T SAY

51
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,210
THAT.

52
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,150
YOU ALSO CAN'T SAY YES, I
PROMISE TO BE ON "YOUR TEAM" AND

53
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,530
NOT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S
TEAM, ETC., SO TRUMP PUTS HIM IN

54
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:05,930
AN UNTENABLE SPOT LIKE HE DID
WITH COMEY AND SO MANY OTHERS.

55
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:12,230
TRUMP AT THIS LATE DATE EITHER
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

56
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:19,540
CAN'T ASK PEOPLE AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT WHETHER THEY ARE ON

57
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,040
YOUR TEAM ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY
ARE CHARGED WITH INVESTIGATING

58
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,580
YOU, OR UNDERSTANDS THAT AND
THINKS, NO, I'M FUNDAMENTALLY

59
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,230
CORRUPT, I DON'T CARE, I DEMAND
CORRUPTION FROM PEOPLE.

60
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,230
AND BOTH

61
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,780
ARE POSSIBLE GIVEN HIS LACK OF
INTELLIGENCE AND HIS DEEP NATURE

62
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,270
AS A CORRUPT PERSON THAT HAS
BEEN AROUND FOREVER AND EVER.

63
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,270
IF

64
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,349
YOU GO BACK TO ALL OF HIS
BUSINESS DEALINGS, TRUMP

65
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:47,349
UNIVERSITY, ETC.

66
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:51,040
NOW ON NUNES,
ONE LAST THING, MIKE QUIGLEY, A

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,290
DEMOCRAT FROM ILLINOIS, SAID
THAT IN A PRIVATE MEETING OF

68
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:05,150
CONGRESS AND HE ASKED NUNES IF
THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE WORKED

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:16,668
WITH HIM ON THIS SECRET MEMO
THAT 

70
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:17,958
IS SO IMPORTANT, THAT

71
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,829
LAUNCHED THIS RELEASE THE MEMO
THING, AND NUNES SAID NO, I

72
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,210
DIDN'T WORK ON IT.

73
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,721
WHEN HE ASKED
DID YOUR STAFF WORK ON IT WITH

74
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:28,600
THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WAS LIKE,
I'M NOT QUICK TO ANSWER THAT.

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
AHH, I SEE.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,120
IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR
STAFF DID WORK WITH THE WHITE

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,569
HOUSE, SO THIS MEMO IS EVEN MORE
USELESS.

78
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:45,410
SO IT'S BASICALLY

79
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,249
WRITTEN BY THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE
AND IS SEEN AS SOME SORT OF

80
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:50,249
GOTCHA OF THE FBI.

81
00:04:50,249 --> 00:00:00,000
PREPOSTEROUS.
