1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,079
In the last half of 2015, around 500 people
in states ranging from California to Massachusetts

2
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:11,389
had two things in common:
They all ate at Chipotle, and they all had

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,539
severe diarrhea.
Every year there are hundreds of food poisoning

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:21,030
outbreaks in the US, but it’s unusual for
one company to see six outbreaks, from three different

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,230
germs, in just six months.
“In 22 years of doing these kinds of cases, I can’t

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,160
think of a chain that has ever had that happen.”
Obviously, not ideal for a company whose brand is

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,150
serving higher-quality food.
“If you’re like other Americans, you love

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,790
to eat Chipotle, but you hate all those terrible
blood stains in your underwear.”

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,220
To understand how Chipotle plans to fix it,
you have to look at the different ways the

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,670
food was contaminated.
For the two large outbreaks in Boston and

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,100
Simi Valley, California, the pathogen was
norovirus.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,380
“I just vomited for many hours straight.”
Norovirus doesn’t come from the food supply

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,170
itself, but rather from a restaurant employee
who was sick but came to work anyway.

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,959
The two locations spreading norovirus were
closed and sanitized, and Chipotle says it

15
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,719
will strengthen employee training.
An outbreak at 22 Chipotle locations in Minnesota

16
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,600
involved Salmonella bacteria, which did come
from the food itself.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,249
“State health officials now are blaming
tomatoes”

18
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:19,689
Chipotle then switched to a different tomato
supplier.

19
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:23,819
But the E. coli outbreak has been tougher
to nail down, in part because cases popped

20
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,200
up in nine different states. And then:
“There is more trouble for Chipotle.”

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,499
The CDC later announced more E. coli cases
from Kansas and Oklahoma, which

22
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:35,920
may or may not be related to the previous
outbreak.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,939
The types of E. coli that make humans sick
live in the intestines of cattle.

24
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:43,049
So people can often get infected from undercooked
beef.

25
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,380
But fruits and vegetables exposed to contaminated
water or manure can also transmit the bacteria.

26
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,950
So here’s what’s a little unnerving for
Chipotle customers.

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,370
“The CEO said that they have tested every
single one of the 64 ingredients that Chipotle

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,779
uses, and they still can’t find the problem.”
Unfortunately, in multistate cases, the CDC

29
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:06,029
can identify the specific source of the food
poisoning only about half the time.

30
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:10,299
And it’s particularly challenging with the
type of food Chipotle serves.

31
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:17,450
“Almost everything that is in a burrito
is in a taco is in a taco bowl. So it’s

32
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,540
hard to parse out and say, 'Oh it was the cilantro,
oh it was the lettuce.'"

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,349
In the meantime, Chipotle hired an expert
to devise a wide-scale food safety plan. It

34
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,730
includes routine DNA testing of ingredients
before they’re shipped to restaurants.

35
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,810
“The testing protocols that he sets up on
the supply-chain are pretty rigorous. So assuming

36
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,900
you can get the supply chain to go along with you, I think that’s going to be

37
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,720
a really positive thing, and especially if they want to do fresh items in their stores.”

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,380
There can be a tradeoff between safe food

39
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,329
and fresh food, as Chipotle seems to be acknowledging.
Instead of shredding cheese and chopping tomatoes,

40
00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:00,640
lettuce, and cilantro inside the restaurants,
they’ll now be processed and packaged off-site

41
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,319
in centralized kitchens.
Chipotle’s stock has been dropping, but

42
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,430
it’s worth remembering that other chains
have weathered much worse.

43
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,250
In 1993, E. coli from undercooked hamburgers
at Jack in the Box sickened 700 people and

44
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,930
killed 4 children.
“They brought in a vice president in charge

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,810
of food safety who had carte blanche to turn
the company around from a food safety perspective.

46
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,810
I think that’s something that Chipotle really
needs to think pretty hard about doing.”

47
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,189
After the Jack in the Box outbreak was over,
they launched a marketing campaign to signal

48
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:36,329
the corporate overhaul.
“I’m ready to make Jack in the Box better than ever.”

49
00:03:38,260 --> 00:00:00,000
The message wasn’t subtle.
