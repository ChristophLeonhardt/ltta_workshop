they 454 this was of the Trump administration and during a press conference at his mar-a-lago resort with the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a president Trump would not say whether he would fire special counsel robert muller or deputy AG rod Rosenstein on the muller probe have you concluded that it's not worth the political fallout to remove either special counsel Muller or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein Jennifer I can say this that there was no collusion and that's been so found as you know by the House Intelligence Committee there's no collusion there was no collusion with Russia other than by the Democrats or as I call them the obstructionist because they truly are obstructionist so we are giving tremendous amounts of paper this was a really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss which is a loss that frankly they shouldn't have had from the standpoint that it's very easy for them they have a tremendous advantage in the electoral college as far as the two gentlemen you told me about they've been saying I'm going to get rid of them for the last three months four months five months and they're still here so we want to get the investigation over with the president also said his team has been cooperating with Muller's investigators Trump's remarks come as the Washington Post is reporting tonight the Trump allies in Congress are taking part in what reads like something of a shakedown on the Deputy Attorney General quote two of president Trump's top legislative men met with Deputy Attorney General rod J Rosenstein this week to press him for more documents about the conduct of law enforcement officials involved in the Russia probe and the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server Rosen Stein's meeting at his office Monday with congressman Mark meadows and Jim Jordan came days after meadows warned Rosenstein that he could face impeachment proceedings or an effort to hold him in contempt of Congress if he did not satisfy GOP demands over on the Senate side debate is heating up over legislation to protect special counsel robert muller the hill is reporting that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa said his committee would take up legislation to protect Muller despite these comments from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell there's no indication that Muller is going to be fired I don't think the president's going to do that and just as a practical matter even if we passed it why would he sign it so you don't think it's a good idea you don't think it's something the president would entertain or should entertain well I don't think you should fire Muller and I don't think he's going to so this is a piece of legislation that's not necessary I'm not judge but I didn't see none of your colleagues fear it enough to say it should be in there I'm the one who decides what we what we take to the floor that's my responsibilities the majority leader and will not be having us on the floor of the Senate that was interesting the hill also reports quote with at least GOP senators Thom Tillis and Lindsey Graham joining Democrats and supporting the bill it's expected to have the votes to clear the Judiciary Committee next week but it faces an uphill climb to getting 60 votes in the Senate much less passing the more conservative House longtime trump ally senator Orrin Hatch of Utah offered his response today when asked by our own Garrett Haake if a bill to protect Muller should be debated on the Senate floor she doesn't think so and I don't think anybody's going to I don't think the president's going to be so stupid as to do something like that that's gonna free just the idea that the president wouldn't do this so we don't need to pass it well that's right and we had to let the president be the president but I don't think he's about to do that he wouldn't he would take such criticism that it wouldn't be worth it to him meanwhile The Wall Street Journal reports tonight President Trump was given a clear warning about his personal attorney Michael Cohen cooperating with investigators potentially quote one of President Donald Trump's longtime legal advisors said he warned the president in a phone call Friday that Michael Cohen would turn against the president and cooperate with federal prosecutors if faced with criminal charges mr. Trump made the call seeking advice from Jay Goldberg who represented mr. Trump in the 90s and early-2000s mr. Goldberg said he cautioned the president not to trust mr. : on a scale of 100 to 1 where 100 is fully protecting the president mr. Cohen isn't even a 1 he said he told mr. Trump Goldberg went on to warn Trump that Cohen could even wear a wire for the feds to record conversations with the president again the FBI rated the office and residences of Cohen last week he's under investigation for possible bank fraud possible money laundering campaign finance violations while Cohen has yet to be charged with any crime let's bring in our leadoff panel for a Wednesday night three of our favorites are back with us Shannon petty peace White House correspondent for Bloomberg Jeremy bash former chief of staff at CIA and the Pentagon also on MSNBC national security analyst and Barbara McQuade former US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan also an MSNBC legal analyst welcome to you all Shannon the president in his remarks today this was a bilateral press conference for both leaders kind of went down a couple of roads hopped on the interstate got off three or four cul-de-sacs are we any clearer on knowing his intentions visa vie Rosenstein and Muller so I know some people thought he missed an opportunity here to say no I'm not going to fire them I heard that he was that is what he was saying I'm not going to vote that way that they are here and he adds into that I want to end this investigation quickly and I know he has been counseled over and over again by his advisors that if you want to end this quickly leave them in place if you fire Muller if you fire Rosenstein that will only drag out this investigation and our reporting also indicates that the temperature has gone down a bit on this whole drumbeat of firing Rosenstein that last week he was openly contemplating firing Rosenstein talking to people about it mulling about it we were told it wasn't very serious but that was a conversation he was having because he was so angry about this Michael Cohen raid but then his attention turned to Syria and his attention turned to Japan and so we think and it seems in that time for the moment at least that drumbeat of effort to fire Rosenstein you know by some of the president's allies has quieted down so Jeremy bash let's talk about mr. Cohen and how he was in the news today here's the president apparently cold calling an old lawyer perhaps because he's having trouble finding new ones are we surprised that this lawyer advised him you know watch for this guy flipping and working for the feds and would you be surprised Michael Cohen as a married father of two people keep saying it could be looking at 20 30 years heavy federal time that could be a life sentence well the old lawyer mr. Goldberger I think had very sound advice for his former client the president which is that the president shouldn't assume that Michael Cohen will always have the president's back and I don't know about wearing a wire but we do know that Michael Cohen has a tendency to record conversations but more fundamentally he has documents he has records he has emails and he has his own personal recollections of conversations with the president and so he is very well positioned to provide information to federal investigators about the full gamut of the Trump organizations business dealings with Russia and in particular any communications between Trump officials and the Russian Federation during the campaign about a conspiracy to violate federal election law which i think is still the heart of what Bob Muller is looking at Barbara let me ask a hypothetical how big a deal how big a whale could Cohen be if he chooses to cooperate with Muller and are we making a mistake every day and in forgetting names like Keith Schiller hope Hicks some of the keepers of the secrets who were on the inside who aren't in the press necessarily every day sure I mean I think we've frequently heard this analogy to the tip of the iceberg that you know we and the public only know a small part of what Robert Muller is up to and that all of these people have the potential to be co-operators I think Michael Cohen could be a very significant cooperator and I know people often say oh he's so loyal to the president he would never flip on him but I have seen this happen time and again with and when as you say people have to decide between a long prison sentence and coming home to their families people when they're in that situation suddenly loyalty doesn't look quite as attractive as it when you were sitting at at the table over lunch and so I've seen it happen and those kinds of co-operators can be incredibly important as Jeremy said his own recollection can really flesh out what's in documents and recordings they can become sort of a narrator for a trial to really bring those documents to life and connect the dots hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
