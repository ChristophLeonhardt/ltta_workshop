OF SECRET IRANIAN NUCLEAR FILES.

30
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,626

DEAL.

59
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:29,103
IT WAS A MULTILATERAL AND

60
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:30,504
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.

61
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:33,474
>> THERE HAD ALSO BEEN ALL THAT

62
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:34,642
PRESSURE CAMPAIGNED BY EUROPEAN

63
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:36,844
LEADERS WHO HAD DONE A LOT OF

64
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:38,412
TRADE WITH IRAN SINCE THE DEAL

65
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:39,813
IN 2015 AND TODAY THEY SAID IN A

00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:46,854
IN AN IMPROVEMENT.

70
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:49,657
BOTH THE U.S. AND EUROPE AT ODDS

71
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:49,990
ON THIS.

72
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,125
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT

73
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:51,525
PLAYS OUT.

74
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:54,261
