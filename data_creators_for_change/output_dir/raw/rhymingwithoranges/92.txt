00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube so lily allen's back and</font>

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,069
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will finally be saved from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> katy</font>

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">perry's and the selena gomez's of this</font>

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,540
world and finally have pop music that

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,820
has depth and social commentary again

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've I've missed her this for years I</font>

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,410
really really have I mean it when I say

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan is one of the pop</font>

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
music musicians with more depth around

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,760
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> days I mean she's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well known</font>

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,590
throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> her career for commenting on</font>

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,570
stuff like the wall of the tabloid press

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">and consumerism in the fear and the role</font>

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,210
of women in the 21st century in 22 and

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,520
even just old granny's getting mugged in

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,070
her breakthrough single alien with her

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,870
new single hard out here she directs her

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,910
wit towards sexism in the pop industry

19
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,129
directly parodying<font color="#CCCCCC"> robin thicke's</font>

20
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,780
blurred lines which of course was

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,329
everybody's favorite misogynistic video

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,640
of 2013 and also takes the piss out of

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,500
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> hip-hop video that's ever had a</font>

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,260
female dancer with a big booty have a

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,989
bottle of champagne<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled all over her</font>

26
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,600
ass in my eyes this video is parody at

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,510
its finest it really throws up a mirror

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,670
to the sexism and double standards

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,070
expected of men and<font color="#CCCCCC"> women in the music</font>

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,840
industry and in society in general

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,479
whether it be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manager of Lily Allen</font>

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,100
in the video chastising her because

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,020
she's put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> baby weight and</font>

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,700
now she's having liposuction to get rid

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,400
of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the idea of Robin Thicke having</font>

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
a big dick being<font color="#E5E5E5"> something sexy where is</font>

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Lily Allen having a baggy pussy is not

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,020
despite the fact they're pretty much

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying the same thing they're both fans</font>

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,310
of penetrative sex which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is nice however</font>

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,990
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys on Facebook what</font>

42
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,060
you thought of lily allen's new music

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,070
video not all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were on the same</font>

44
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">page</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as me here's what Becky Nixon wrote</font>

45
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,540
I don't understand who the makers of

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,860
this video imagined they are

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,930
enlightening if you watch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you get</font>

48
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,610
the satire chances are you're already

49
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">along to this way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,060
not you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,590
objectifying the women in the video

52
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,360
completely ignorant of the message

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,250
punching a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dog in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the face to make a</font>

54
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,140
point about animal cruelty is not

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,810
productive and neither is this video I

56
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,219
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nixon makes a really good point</font>

57
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,209
but I still disagree with her I mean I

58
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that it's so clearly a parody that</font>

59
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,530
I don't think anybody's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

60
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:13,860
getting

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,390
pleasure out of this video I mean look

62
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,540
at look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

63
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,250
the best person to pass judgment on

64
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,310
straight male tastes but that's not sexy

65
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,920
right hypnotic yes sexy less so Lily

66
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Allen's videos also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> receive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a lot</font>

67
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">of criticism about the objectification</font>

68
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,550
of specifically black women<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

69
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,340
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> and therefore has been called by a</font>

70
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,770
few people most significantly Julianne

71
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,959
Moore the Guardian newspaper columnist

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,410
that her video might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little bit</font>

73
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,840
racist but working dances in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the video</font>

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,280
are predominantly black and they are the

75
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,560
focus point of the objectification in

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video although there are two white</font>

77
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,830
dances that I managed to to clock one in

78
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,480
the main dancing scene and one who has

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,640
pink hair later on in the video and so

80
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,870
it's not completely a black focused

81
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,000
backing crew however there was a point

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,280
that Julianne Moore made that I quite

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,320
sympathized with it was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that</font>

84
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,620
these women unlike Lily Allen who in

85
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,040
this video is owning the sexism<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,080
she's received and all of the misogyny

87
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,519
that has been thrown at her shes owning

88
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,320
it and throwing it back in the

89
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry's face these black women</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

90
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,980
are used as the backing dancers for Lily

91
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,190
Allen and who have throughout their

92
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,519
careers probably received quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

93
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,510
objectification because of the color of

94
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,250
their skin the way their booty shakes

95
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,600
and also their sex it seems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

96
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,500
are not given a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to own and to</font>

97
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,380
respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the treatment that they have</font>

98
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">received in their careers and then at</font>

99
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lily Allen just walks off left</font>

100
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,070
with the predominantly black backing

101
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,769
dancers there and that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest the</font>

102
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,150
more i think about it doesn't sit well

103
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,980
with me so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lily Allen's video</font>

104
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,530
racist I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so but I feel that</font>

105
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">she could have made the point in her</font>

106
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,760
video in a better way then using and

107
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,890
objectifying these black women I mean

108
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,839
what if she had used guys instead of

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
girls<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would have really flipped the</font>

110
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,830
whole thing on its head<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we know from</font>

111
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,850
these videos from John<font color="#CCCCCC"> mango</font>

112
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,220
the college baseball player that they

113
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,770
guys can't work and when goes to work

114
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,640
they can look really good doing it I'm

115
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,770
gonna need a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry as always</font>

116
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,690
with these videos the engagement is more

117
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,210
important than what I had to say so make

118
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,800
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you</font>

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,310
think of lily allen's new video for hard

120
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,370
out here is she a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit sexist is</font>

121
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,530
she a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit racist is she a little</font>

122
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,930
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both or neither let me know</font>

123
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">downstairs in the comments and I will be</font>

124
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,390
floating down there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sharing</font>

125
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,330
my opinions I'm also guys twerking

126
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,460
thoughts on that um I have been wrong

127
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,720
with oranges I think that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

132
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,020
I don't understand who the makers of

133
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,729
this video

134
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,499
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are enlightening if</font>

135
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,599
you watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and you get the satire</font>

136
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,879
chances are you already in like a lion

137
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">team this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult Becky your</font>
