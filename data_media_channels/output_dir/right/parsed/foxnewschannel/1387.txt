ELIZABETH: WELL, YOU CAN SEE
BEHIND ME THE WALL IS A POWERFUL
REMINDER OF THE INCREDIBLE
SACRIFICE OF AMERICAN MEN AND
WOMEN IN UNIFORM.
AS WE HONOR THEM, THE FIGHT
CONTINUES IN HELPING THE NEXT
GENERATION OF VETERANS.
I CAUGHT UP WITH THE SENIOR VICE
COMMANDER, DJ LAWRENCE AS WELL
AS THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF
MILITARY AFFAIRS A USAA, VICE
ADMIRAL JOHN BIRD TO FIND OUT
MORE.
>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WHERE ARE WE TODAY.
A SPECIAL HOLIDAY, HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE.
WHERE ARE WE?
>> ELIZABETH, GREAT TO BE WITH
YOU.
WE ARE LOCATED NEXT TO THE
LINCOLN MEMORIAL BETWEEN THE
VIETNAM AND LINCOLN WERE
MEMORIAL.
THE HIGHNESSES THIS MAGNIFICENT
WALL.
133 FEET LONG WITH 645,000
BUILT-IN SAN ANTONIO THE U.S.A.
AND DONNA FOR THE THREE-DAY
WEEKEND.
>> I WANT TO BRING YOU INTO THE
CONVERSATION BECAUSE YOU AT THE
VFW BUT THE VERY SYMBOLIC
MEANING.
TELL US WHY THEY WERE CHOSEN TO
CREATE THE SLIDE WHY IT MEANS SO
MUCH TO YOU AS WELL.
>> TO THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN
WARS, WE ADOPTED IN THE EARLY
1920s.
WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE OUR
OFFICIAL MEMORIAL FLOWER.
THEN AND NOW WE FEEL THAT THIS
SIGNIFIES NOT ONLY AT THE
BLOODSHED ON A BATTLEFIELD, BUT
IT ALSO EVOKES THE MEMORY AND
EMOTIONS ASSOCIATED.
>> YOU AND I'VE BEEN TALKING
OVER THE PAST COUPLE DAYS ABOUT
THE SYMBOLISM AND IT IS
INSPIRING AND SAT AT THE SAME
TIME.
YOU SAID THAT TO ME.
WHY?
>> IT'S INSPIRING AND MAKES YOU
GRATEFUL BECAUSE MEN AND WOMEN
IN OUR COUNTRY WILL RAISE THE
SERVICE WILLING TO SACRIFICE
THEIR LIVES.
AND IN FACT THEY.
THE SAD NEWS COMES IN THAT EVEN
TODAY WE LOSE MEN AND WOMEN IN
COMBAT.
AND SO IT IS A HUGE SACRIFICE,
BUT WE HAVE TO BE SAD THAT WE
LOST SO MANY AMERICAN, SO MANY
FINE YOUNG MEN WOMEN TO PRESERVE
THE FREEDOM.
WE ARE GRATEFUL THEY WILL DO IT,
BUT IT IS SAD.
>> YOU PROBABLY TRAVEL ALMOST
365 DAYS OUT OF THE YEAR FOR THE
VFW.
YOU MEET THESE YOUNG MEN AND
WOMEN SACRIFICING THEIR LIVES TO
THIS DAY.
IT IS IMPORTANT WE KNOW THEY ARE
HERE TO REMEMBER THE LIVES WHO
HAVE BEEN LOST?
>> IT IS.
MEMORIAL DAY FOR US IS THE DAY
THAT WE ALL SHOULD PAUSE AND PAY
TRIBUTE TO THOSE HEROIC PATRIOTS
THAT ROSE UP AND PAID THE
ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.
AS A NATION, WE MUST ALWAYS A
MEMBER TO TAKE THE TIME OUT TO
NOT ONLY HONOR AND MEMORIALIZE
THOSE HEROES, BUT ALSO THE
FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES LEFT
BEHIND AS A RESULT OF THAT.
ELIZABETH: HARD NOT TO BE MOVED
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS.
