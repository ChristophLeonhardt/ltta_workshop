when the kids returned to Mohawk College in Hamilton Ontario next month they're about to find that their campus has become that much more diverse for there shall be a new addition to the student body namely a recently released terrorist I'm sorry excuse me I meant to say a recently released mental patient one who harbors Islamist fantasies isn't inclusion wonderful perhaps the name I Anna Lee Hassan Ali rings a bell in March 2016 the 30 year old burst into a Canadian Forces recruiting office in North Toronto wielding a large kitchen knife Ali punched slashed and stabbed a corporal at the entrance he then chased the sergeant who rushed out of her office alley narrowly missed slicing the back of her neck and then he tried to stab another sergeant who'd fallen to the ground when Ali was finally subdued he was charged with nine counts including attempted murder now you think this guy would be incarcerated either in prison or the loony bin for a very very long time given the gravity of the charges a but no according to a fascinating piece in the Toronto Sun by Michelle Mandel Ali is soon going to be released from the secure psychiatric facility he's being detained at so he can go back to school gee I hope Mohawk College doesn't have a culinary arts program given Ali's love for certain types of cutlery now Ali will initially be supervised but the interior Review Board has decided in its glorious wisdom that he will eventually be allowed to attend classes without any supervision because really what could possibly go wrong in truth this story stinks worse than a dead skunk for starters we are once again being told by the usual suspects that Ali was merely suffering from you guessed it mental illness when he committed his slash and dash spree two years ago oh yes it was a terrible thing indeed and absolutely terrifying for his victims but don't you dare label it as an act of terrorism because alley was just having oh I don't know bad day and he was later diagnosed with schizophrenia so there and yet why would Ali choose a Canadian government office that was recruiting soldiers well it turns out he had some concerns about Canada's foreign policy dealings in regards to Islamic nations oops I use the past tense here because you see the entero Review Board notes that Ali quote continues to express concerns about the Canadian government and its interactions with Muslim countries end quote Ned no radical Islam to see here folks move along move along oh and check out this other little inconvenient goof according to the O R B Ali claims he wanted to martyr himself at the time of the attack he actually expressed disappointment that he hadn't been killed when he was arrested dammit those 72 voluptuous black eyed virgins we'll just have to continue waiting for mr. wonderful and yet despite the target and his motivation and his lust for martyrdom we're still all being told that Ali's crimes had nothing whatsoever to do with radical Islam look maybe I was born in the night but I wasn't born last night and by the way why is it that yet again mental illness and being a jihadist must be mutually exclusive why is it so hard to comprehend that Ali is mentally ill and he also harbors a deep-seated hatred for the West or is even contemplating such a thing - I don't know culturally insensitive for polite society to ponder these days but the worst thing about the Ali story is this whether you believe he's simply a poor lamb who struggles with mental illness or he's a wolf hell-bent on killing infidels or that maybe he's a bit of both consider this nugget of wisdom from the Ontario revealed which has greenlit the way for Ali to attend Mohawk College quote Ali still poses a significant threat to the safety of the public and holds some of the same delusions that he experienced at the time of the attack end quote can you believe your ears folks the or B is admitting that Ali is still mentally ill and he is still a clear and present danger and he is still fully capable of picking up a butcher knife yet again but he's nevertheless going back to school in September why is the o RB willing to roll the dice on this guy is it because the board wants to show sensitivity or that it wants to virtue signal that everybody deserves a second chance even someone who is still mentally ill and is perhaps a terrorist who craves martyrdom how did we ever get to this point and how can we ever return to a state of normalcy one in which Public Safety actually Trump's political correctness for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
