I found out what they mean Chuck it yes yes this is the one hi guys it's meta and Nick and today we're going to be trying Oreos I am super excited I just see a variation of flavors that I've never tried before so let's do this I actually hate this - you're so much so I don't know why they would put that between Oreo cookies - ooh and a chocolate flavor sounds like a great combination so I'm really excited I think it's gonna pay really well together it doesn't smell a lot great it's not that bad yeah I don't think they made the pistachio too strong tastes like sweet air dozen really taste like anything to me but if five were use I don't I would give it maybe like a replay side yeah 3.5 so the next or your product is the rocky road trip it has marshmallow bits and ocular flavored cream I'm really excited for this one I love rocky road ice cream yes yes this is the one there's just a whole dessert in a cookie which is why it's great I would eat there's over an original any day I'm so good pardon me if they put the marshmallow inside the cookie part that is that's smart oh my god it's almost better than a regular Oreo so I'm definitely five over five and I think I just hit my sugar high we have strawberry shortcake it's the Good Humor kind which brings back memories this does not taste like that ice cream this is disgusting tastes like a pop-tart stews sweet it's too much strawberry I'm just it's too much I mean I kind of got your say it kinda tastes like a very sweet handle yeah I'm biting into a candle right now it looks very patriotic on the inside it does it looks like a confetti cupcakes are we supposed to feel like a tingling sensation Oh like in my mouth can you hear it it feels so wrong so now we have the chocolate which sounds amazing and smells so good too kind I like that peanut butter chocolate swirl thing oh god it's so good I was expecting this Oreo to taste like if you would dip in original Oreo into peanut butter but it actually didn't taste like that whatsoever I feel like they should have one cookie chocolate one cookie peanut butter yes that would have been perfect
