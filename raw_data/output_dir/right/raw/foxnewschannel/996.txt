JONATHAN HUNT HAS MORE.

00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:34,745
CANDIDATE THAT CAN BEST

HE TOUTS HIMSELF AS HAVING THE

25
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:03,974
LIKE EVERY CANDIDATE, HE TOO IS

26
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:05,476
TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW TO DEAL

27
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:07,978
WITH THE SPECTOR OF PRESIDENT

00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:12,717
BUT I'M STATING MY CASE.

31
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:14,752

I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

33
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:19,457

00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:24,929
CLOSE.

38
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:27,798
THE LEADING CANDIDATE IS ADAM

00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,538
SAYING HE CAN BEAT WHATEVER

43
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:36,407
DEMOCRAT WINS THE PARTY AND HE'S

44
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,376
DISMISSING TALK OF A SO-CALLED

45
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:39,043
BLUE WAVE.

46
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:42,246
>> THERE IS NO BLUE WAVE HERE.

47
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:42,747
DOESN'T EXIST.

48
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:45,282
WE'RE LACKING FORWARD TO A RED

49
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:45,583
WAVE.

00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:49,186
>> CONFIDENT YOU'LL BE THE NEXT

51
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:51,021
GOVERNOR OF NEVADA?

52
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,157

WE EXPECT TO CALL THE REPUBLICAN

56
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:02,800
PRIMARY RACE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

57
00:02:02,800 --> 00:00:00,000
LIKELY TO BE A GOOD BIT LONGER
