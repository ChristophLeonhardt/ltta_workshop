really really really slowly because they

<font color="#CCCCCC">Burgos commute from 10 up to 10 or 20</font>

160
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,870
meters a year it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> very cold</font>

161
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,060
climates but because ice is still fluid

162
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,490
is not liquid crystal fluid there are

163
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,230
these kind of layers inside it because

164
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,600
ice towards the surface of the glacier

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,180
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> move because of gravity extra still</font>

166
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,130
that gravitational pull and the ice

167
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">crystals inside it will align</font>

168
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,480

169
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,000

in terminal deformation as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> surface</font>

171
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,860
ice moves choruses can form over time

172
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,390
because the solid<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being pulled apart</font>

173
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,180
and at the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is more movement</font>

174
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,560
and at the bottom because<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the bottom</font>

175
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,990
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so all this friction and also</font>

176
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,910
yeah it's all frozen tomato the warm

177
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,670
base places they move in different ways

178
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,370
basal sliding fast basal sliding happens

179
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,630
which was the one that we talked about

180
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">for which is when the pressure melted</font>

181
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,440
water at the base act like a lubricant

182
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,530
so that the glacier can advance and if

183
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,660
there are big boulders at the base of

184
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,060
the glacier and might creep forward

185
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,480
creeping is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 to 2 meters a year because</font>

186
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the increased friction but if it's</font>

187
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,360
hot or due<font color="#E5E5E5"> to global warming or whatever</font>

188
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,050
it can surge add up to a hundred times

189
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,530
its normal rate because of the

190
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">increasing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of the lubricating</font>

layer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fortune rotational flow which</font>

192
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,860
is when a glacier forms in like a

193
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,750
bowl-shaped hollow inside of a mountain

194
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the basic moves in like a rotational</font>

195
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,980
motion and it can form a quarry which

196
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">offer quite a bit later and over time</font>

197

they letting me go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lip of the</font>

198
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,490
quarry which allows the quarry gracia to

199
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,190
feed a valley glacier which follows as

200
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,140
the ice is added<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the top depressor</font>

201
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,090
rotates and the pressure at the front of

202
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,880
the hollow leads to pressure melting

203
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,210
extending and congressional oh when the

204
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,030
gradient of the valley changes so when

205
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,680
it less it advances and comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a point</font>

206
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">where the valley is less steep and the</font>

207
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,710
isolate will slow down and become their

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,120
car because it's all company push

209
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,590
together so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a compression part</font>

210
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and extending flow is when the gradient</font>

211
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,480
of the valley increases the ice over the

212
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,760
edge of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop will pull away faster</font>

213
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,590
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ice behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it which makes that</font>

214
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stretches the Glassic the gusty</font>

215
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,670
out making it there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can lead to</font>

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,040
the formation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> classes is literally it</font>

217
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,110
kind of pulled apart so think of a mars

218
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,870
bar and then you like breaking apart

219
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,100
yeah we did that in a mess and<font color="#CCCCCC"> phyllis</font>

220
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,650
fun it's a great time erosion<font color="#E5E5E5"> is usually</font>

221
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,960
the greatest where the ice is the

222
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,240
thickest because this is where the

223
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">largest amount of weight is acting with</font>

224
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,969
all the rocks below there are two

225
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,250
kind of three overarching factors that

226
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,350
influence placing movement one of them

227
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,600
is the steepness of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Valley slope because</font>

228
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a steep the slope the more</font>

229
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,339
extension will occur and if it flattens

230
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,399
out or if it reverses it's a slight

231
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,439
brother then compression plate blocker

232
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:58,540
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second kind of two and three</font>

233
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,850
part is the rolling movement<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two</font>

234
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,250
which acts as a lubricant the mix the

235
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,889
ice granules and more mobile and the

236
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,019
amount of water is dependent on season

237
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,730
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there might be natural melting</font>

238
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,290
and there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different type of</font>
