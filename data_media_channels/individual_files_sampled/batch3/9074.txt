SENATORS CHILDREN. AS A DUCTING PROTEST AND CIVILITY HEAT UP HERE IN WASHINGTON AND BEYOND, SOME ARE FOCUSING ON COMMENTS FROM PROMINENT DEMOCRATS I CORY BOOKER EARLIER THIS SUMMER. THAT IS MY CALL TO ACTION HERE. PLEASE DON'T JUST COME HERE TODAY AND THEN GO HOME. GO TO THE HILL. GET UP AND PLEASE GET UP IN THE FACE OF SOME CONGRESSPEOPLE. Shannon: REPUBLICAN SENATOR RAND PAUL'S WIFE REMEMBERS WELL THE ATTACK ON HER HUSBAND LAST YEAR HAS HAD A OPEN LETTER TO HIM AND ASKING HIM TO TAKE BACK THOSE COMMENTS. "I KEEP A LOADED GUN BY MY BED. IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS MY FAMILY HAS EXPERIENCED THREATS AT A HORRIFYING LEVEL." WELCOME KELLY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. Shannon: WHAT MADE YOU AT THIS POINT REACH OUT. WE ALWAYS MEMBER YOUR HUSBAND WAS AT THE SHOOTING LESTER THAT ALMOST KILLED A CONGRESSMAN. HE WAS PERSONALLY ATTACKED. SERIOUS LUNG DAMAGE. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF HIS INJURIES AND WHERE WE AT NOW FOR YOU GUYS? I WAS MOTIVATED TO WRITE THE LETTER JUST FOR ME. INCREDIBLE ACTIVITIES I HAVE WATCHED THE LAST WEEK. SEEING HEIDI AND TED CRUZ FORCED OUT OF THEIR RESTAURANT IN D.C. LAST WEEK. PEOPLE IN THEIR FACE. WAVING THEIR MIDDLE FINGER, GETTING IN THEIR FACE. NOT ALLOWING THEM TO EVEN EAT THEIR MEAL AND THEN WHEN THEIR HOME ADDRESS WAS RELEASED ON THE INTERNET IN KENTUCKY AND HIS CELL PHONE NUMBER WAS RELEASED. I FELT INCREDIBLY THREATENED AND FRIGHTENED. I HAD BEEN FRIED WHEN HE LEFT FOR D.C. THAT WEEKEND. THE NEW MESSAGES GET UP IN THEIR FACE. GET UP IN PEOPLE'S FACE. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE JUST HOW THREATENING THAT FEELS. HOW VIOLATED YOU FEEL WHEN SOMEBODY INVADES YOUR PERSONAL SPACE LIKE THAT. IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP TO MOVE THE DISCOURSE ALONG. THE NIGHT I WROTE THAT I WAS SITTING IN MY HOUSE AND I SAW THE SHERIFF'S CAR GO BY MY CAR AND I WAS GRATEFUL FOR IT. I WAS GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SURVEILLANCE OF OUR HOME. I JUST FELT SO SAD. HOW DO WE GET HERE? I WANT TO READ SOMETHING FROM BOOKER, HE THINKS THAT CLIP WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE CONTENT. A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO END HOMELESSNESS AND TELL THEM ABOUT COMMENTS AND SOLUTIONS. HE SAID I DON'T WANT TO HATE ANYBODY BECAUSE I KNOW THE TRUTH. WE HAVE SEEN ON THE HILL OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE, AND ON MANY OF THEM CHOOSING TO WALK WITH POLICE ESCORTS BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THE HALLWAYS AND THE THREATS. THIS HAS HAPPENED BOTH TIMES IN THE AISLE. HOW DOES IT CHANGE? ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I ADDRESS MY LETTER TO SENATOR BOOKER'S BECAUSE HE AND RAND HAVE WORKED TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN WAY. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I FEEL REALLY PASSIONATELY ABOUT. I'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH THE GROUP CALLED JUSTICE ACTION NETWORK. WE ARE PUSHING FOR THE FIRST STEP. I WAS PREPARING TO COME TO D.C. FOR A CONFERENCE AT MICROSOFT TOMORROW AND I STARTED THINKING, THE WORLD IS SO POLARIZED RIGHT NOW APPEAR. I FEAR THAT WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES. WORDS DO MATTER AND PERHAPS HE DIDN'T MEAN IT AND SUCH AN AGGRESSIVE WAY BUT WHEN YOU ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF PEOPLE GETTING UP IN YOUR FACE, IT DOES FEEL EXTREMELY PERSONAL. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SINCE HE HAS BEEN SHOT AT AND PHYSICALLY ATTACKED IN THE LAST YEAR, AND THEN ON THE HEELS OF OUR PERSONAL HOME ADDRESS BEING RELEASED, I FELT EXTREMELY VULNERABLE. I FELT EXTREMELY THREATENED. I HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE BEYOND THIS. WHATEVER HAPPENS WITH THE CONFIRMATION. I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE BEYOND THIS. TO FIND SOME SOLUTIONS FOR THINGS LIKE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IN SPIRIT IN THE PAST IT HAS BROUGHT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. PEOPLE ON ALL SIDES OF THIS
