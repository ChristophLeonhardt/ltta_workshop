IMPLICATIONS. BEN, THANK YOU, ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS A LOT. Martha: BRENDA FOX PULLS OUT TONIGHT THAT WE HAVE BEEN POURING OVER COMMONLY GIVE US A PICTURE OF HOW WOMEN IN THE COUNTRY ARE FEELING ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH VOTE. FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, TWO DEMOCRATIC SWING VOTES, SARAH McCASKILL AND HEIDI HEITKAMP IN NORTH DAKOTA COULD SUFFER AMONG WOMEN IF THEY VOTE NO ON KAVANAUGH. YOU CAN SEE A MAJORITY OF THE WOMEN VOTERS AND THOSE TWO STATES WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO VOTE FOR THEM IF THEY REJECT KAVANAUGH. HERE NOW, KIMBERLY, A SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR AND DIRECTOR OF A MOVEMENT THAT SUPPORTS THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH PAIR THAT IS THE FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU. YOU ARE A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, WE HAVE SEEN THIS AS A BONDING EXERCISE AMONG A LOT OF WOMEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO FEEL LIKE IT IS FINALLY THEIR TURN TO STAND UP AND BE HEARD. WHY DO YOU NOT FEEL LIKE THAT, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS YOURSELF? I THINK THIS IDEA OF CREATING THIS VICTIM MENTALITY IS ACTUALLY HURTING OUR GIRLS. I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO BE A SURVIVOR AND A VICTOR. YOU DON'T CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE VICTIMIZED, BUT YOU DO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT YOU REMAIN A VICTIM. I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THAT TO THE PERSON WHO HURT ME. I WAS GOING TO BE THE VICTOR IN THIS. THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME. YOU KNOW? I AM THE VICTOR. I THINK WHEN YOU TELL THAT TO OUR GIRLS. Martha: IT IS AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE. WHEN YOU WATCH DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, DID YOU NOT FIND HER CREDIBLE? I THINK THE WORD CREDIBLE NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED A LITTLE MORE. I THINK SHE WAS COMPELLING PAIRED SHE WAS DEFINITELY COMPELLING. AND I DO BELIEVE THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT SHE FEELS THAT HAPPENED, AND IT PROBABLY SOMETHING PROBABLY DID HAPPEN TO HER. BUT THE IDEA THAT SHE COULD SAY 100% THAT SHE KNEW WHO IT WAS, BUT SHE COULDN'T ANSWER A LOT OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS, I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START TALKING ABOUT, THE IDEA THAT WOMEN NEVER LIE AND MEN ALWAYS DO. THAT SETS UP OUR MEN AND OUR SONS FOR SOME DISASTROUS EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE. I KNOW I AM HEARING FROM OTHERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHO ARE UP IN ARMS OVER THIS, AND THEY JUST WANTED TO STOP. GET THIS CONFIRMATION TO MOVE FORWARD. Martha: BUT YOU HEARD ALYSSA MILANO, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD THAT SOUND BY JUST A MOMENT AGO. I DID. Martha: SHE IS SAYING TOO BAD. WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SUFFERING IN THESE CASES FOR SO LONG, AND OF MEN FEEL A LITTLE BIT BEATEN UP RIGHT NOW, THAT IS TOO BAD. THE PENDULUM HAS TO SWING. IT ACTUALLY HURTS WOMEN. I WISH THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS. WHAT THEY ARE DOING BY MARGINALIZING AN ACTIVE ASSAULT OR VIOLENCE AGAINST A WOMAN AND TURNING IT INTO A POLITICAL WEAPON, IT DIMINISHES THE VOICE OF EVERY WOMAN MAY BE ASSAULTED OR HAVE VIOLENCE OR MY CASE, WHERE YOU WERE MOLESTED AND NO ONE WILL BELIEVE YOU. HOW COULD THEY WHEN THEY TURN IT INTO A POLITICAL WEAPON? AND HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU CARE ABOUT WOMEN WHEN YOU ARE WILLING TO DO THAT? THE WOMEN THAT I TALK TO, I KEPT ASKING THEM, THE WOMEN WHO WERE WITH THEIR "BELIEVE WOMEN" SHIRTS, WHAT IF IT IS NOT TRUE? WHAT IF HE DIDN'T DO IT? Martha: WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU? THEY SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER. Martha: THAT IS REALLY FRIGHTENING. SO THE MESSAGE IS WE DON'T MIND TAKING DOWN INNOCENT GUYS IF IT SERVES THE LARGER CAUSE? THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MESSAGE. Martha: INCREDIBLE. SCARY, ISN'T IT? AND YOU HAVE A MARCH. TELL US QUICKLY ABOUT THAT. WE HAD A CONFERENCE TODAY, AND WE ARE LAUNCHING A MOM'S MARCH, OUR SECOND ABDUL MOM'S MARCH THAT WE ARE HOLDING MY COASTING IN SAN ANTONIO. THE REASON WHY IS WE WANT IN ALTERNATIVE VOICE TO THESE RADICAL FEMINISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO DEMORALIZE OUR MEN, DEMONIZE THEM HERE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY NO, WE LOVE MEN. THERE IS EVIL IN THE WORLD, BUT IT IS NOT ALL MEN. THE IDEA THAT WHITE MEN ARE THE ENEMY OF EVERY PERSON, EVERY WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY. WE WANT TO TURN THAT AROUND. THAT IS WHAT THIS MOVEMENT IS ALL ABOUT. WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARD. WE ARE RALLYING. MAMA BEAR HAS BEEN POKED, AND THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME CHANGES IN THE CONVERSATION.
