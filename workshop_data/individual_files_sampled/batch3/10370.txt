venezuela's President has slammed the u.s. over quote blackmail campaign nicolas maduro added the washington has threatened every single member of the Organization of American States as it bids to influence the vote on Venezuela's suspension from the group in Tuesday's vote the OAS approved a resolution to start the suspension of caracas ice after heavy lobbying from washington which has been calling on countries to isolate venezuela the Venezuelan people deserve better than what the regime of Nicolas Maduro offers them that suspension that suspension it's not a goal unto itself but it would show that OAS backs up its words with action and it would send a powerful signal to the Maduro regime a call on fellow member states to apply additional pressure on the Maduro regime including sanctions and further diplomatic isolation until such time as it undertakes the actions necessary to return genuine democracy however some in the u.s. believe America's stance on Venezuela is still not hard enough fairly Petrenko explains could it be that some Hawks in Washington are having second thoughts on how great their tactic of orchestrating regime change is I've got a couple of quotes from a US magazine for you of course no one wants to see a regression in which military coos are the norm certainly expecting a faction of the military to depose the current regime and restore democracy entails risk did worrying about the risks and side effects of regime change just outweigh the goals said by the folks in DC you wish look at what the piece is called elephants in the room it's time for a coup in Venezuela this wasn't just from some reporter writing for the magazine the author is a man who advised george w bush the president behind the afghanistan and iraq invasions a few more revolutions took place while he was sitting pretty in the Oval Office yep and apart from the couple of lines I've shown you the whole piece is one big call for regime change it says there are no guarantees of course but that's no excuse for complacency so brain with the COO no biggie just a major u.s. foreign policy website running a piece calling for the violent military overthrow of another country's government Wow sure restore a legitimate constitutional democracy is the natural outcome of June 2 takeovers but just one slip like that can't overshadow the image of the American press right rather than fear a coup the international community should encourage all Venezuelans including soldiers to restore democracy the question is how to get rid of mr. Maduro before he completes the destruction of his country introducing the Venezuela coup hungry news it's true that Venezuelans have found themselves in deep deep trouble but since when has it been for some foreign media to decide when there's to be a coup they can be bloody they can claim many many lives and throw countries into Wars chaos oh we shouldn't forget that we're reading the papers from a country whose folks in charge have said things like this for the safety and the security of all peoples in Latin America it is time for Maduro to go we have many options for Venezuela and by the way I'm not going to rule out a military option we have troops all over the world in places that are very very far away Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying we have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary meddling interfering invading any ideas whose world champion at that you
