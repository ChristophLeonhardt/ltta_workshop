Laura: TIME FOR ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF OUR SERIES DEFENDING THE FIRST WHERE WE EXPOSE THE ENEMIES OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT, FREE EXPRESSION AND FREE THOUGHT. HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER IN BROWNSBURG, INDIANA, SAYING THAT HE WAS FORCED TO RESIGN AFTER YOU CHALLENGE THE DISTRICT'S POLICY ON TRANSGENDER STUDENTS. THAT POLICY REQUIRES TEACHERS TO ADDRESS THESE STUDENTS BY THEIR PREFERRED NAME INSTEAD OF THEIR BIRTH NAME. TEACHER JOHN SAYS THAT THAT VIOLATES BOTH HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS HE AND HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. I RECENTLY SPOKE TO MR. CUVIER AND HIS ATTORNEY AND I BEGAN BY CHALLENGING ON WHETHER THE SCHOOL DISTRICT REALLY VIOLATED THE CLIENT'S RIGHTS. YOU CAN'T USE THE CLASSROOM FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO SPEECH WISE, I MEAN, YOU ARE UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL. IF SOMEBODY IS A TEACHER OF ANTHROPOLOGY WANTS TO GET UP AND TALK ABOUT HIS OR HER VIEW ON NAZISM OR CREATIONISM, THAT IS MY FREE SPEECH, GAS, BUT YOU ARE UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL TO TEACH SPANISH. SO YOU CAN BE FIRED FOR THAT, CORRECT? YES, TO YOUR POINT, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE HERE. THAT THEY UNREASONABLY THREW OUT AN ACCOMMODATION THAT WAS IN PLACE. THEY ACTUALLY HAD A WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO ALLOW JOHN TO EXPRESS HIS CONVICTIONS BY USING ONLY LAST NAMES OF ALL OF THE STUDENTS. THAT REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION WAS TOSSED OUT BY THE ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE SCHOOL YEAR. HE EITHER RESIGNS, FOLLOWS THE LINE OF THE SCHOOL, USING THESE TRANSGENDER NAMES THAT WERE NOT AS HE SAID THE BIRTH NAMES OR HE WILL BE SUSPENDED AND THEN TERMINATED. THOSE WERE THE CHOICES. SO FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OUR LEGAL POSITION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE AN ILLEGAL DISCHARGE. THAT IS NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE IS CAN THE GOVERNMENT COMPEL HIM TO VIOLATE HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS? THERE IS SUFFICIENT FEDERAL LAW THAT SAYS THAT THEY MUST MAKE A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IF HE HAS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. IN THOSE CASES THEY ARE WELL ESTABLISHED AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A NEW ONE, BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH AN INSIDIOUS EFFORT BY A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY, IF YOU WILL, A SCHOOL PAID BY TAXPAYER FUNDS. SO WE SEE THIS AS A DIFFERENT WRINKLE THAT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE IN THE CASES COMING UP. Laura: I THINK THAT THE STUDIES ON TRANSGENDER IS HIM ARE VERY DIFFICULT. FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS NO REAL LONG PEER-REVIEWED STUDY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT ADS WITH WHETHER HORMONE BLOCKERS, WE DO NOT NEED TO GET INTO THAT, IT IS NOT RELEVANT. BUT THERE IS A REALLY EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN KIDS CALLING THEMSELVES TRANSGENDER. AND JUST IN THE BRITISH STUDY, THEY WENT FROM I THINK IT IS 94 REFERRALS AS GENDER DYSPHORIA, THE TECHNICAL TERM FROM 2009-2010. 94 AT THE CLINIC TO NOW BETWEEN 2016-2171986 REFERRALS INCLUDING SOME OF THOSE WHERE CHILDREN ARE YOUNGER THAN SIX YEARS OF AGE. PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT THIS COULD BE GENDER AFFIRMING TREATMENTS AND ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING KIDS WHO CALL THEMSELVES TRANSGENDER, MOST GROW OUT OF IT. THAT IS THE WAY THAT IT IS. BUT OTHER STUDIES, ADOLESCENT HEALTH JOURNAL SAYING THAT THEY ARE TWO TO THREE MORE TIMES LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION, SUICIDE, OTHER MENTAL DISORDERS, VERY DIFFICULT MENTAL DISORDERS, VERY DIFFICUL DIFFICULT. SO ARE YOU ACTING IN PART OUT OF CONCERN FOR THESE KIDS THINKING THAT THEY ARE GETTING BAD ADVICE FROM THEIR PARENTS OR OTHERS? I DO REALLY CARE ABOUT THESE STUDENTS, THAT IS WHY I WANTED TO SIDESTEP THE WHOLE ISSUE. I WANTED TO FOCUS ON TEACHING THE KIDS ORCHESTRA AND BEING ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THEM. AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR CULTIVATE FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY STUDENTS INCLUDING THE TRANSGENDER STUDENTS OF MINE. AND I REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE TEACHING THEIR PET I LOVE THESE KIDS AND I WANT TO CONTINUE THAT WORK. Laura: JOHN, WHAT WAS THE REACTION FROM THE OTHER STUDENTS? THEY MUST HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS. WHAT GRADE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 9-12. Laura: WHAT WAS THE REACTION OF THE OTHER STUDENTS WHEN THEY CHANGE NAMES AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TERM? IN MY CLASS, BECAUSE I HAD BEEN REFERRING TO STUDENTS BY THEIR LAST NAME ONLY, IT HAS NOT REALLY BEEN A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. WE FOCUSED ON WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM TO CREATE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. I THINK THAT I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN BEING ABLE TO CREATE A CULTURE AND MY CLASSROOM THAT THEY ARE RESPECTING EACH OTHER AND I EXPECT THEM TO. AND I CARED FOR THEM AND DO RESPECT THEM ALL. Laura: AND THE SUIT BEING FILED IN FEDERAL COURT? WE HOPE NOT, WE HOPE THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD AT 6:30 ON MONDAY, RECANTS, ALLIANCE OF FREEDOM BROUGHT ME INTO THIS TO TRY TO AVOID LITIGATION IF WE CAN GET IT HANDLED, THAT'S WHAT JOHN WANTS AND WHAT WE WANT.
