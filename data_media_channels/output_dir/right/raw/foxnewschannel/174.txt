HE IS SON OF EXISTING KING.

152
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:03,180
I THINK HE IS ON A BAD TRACK.

153
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,049
I CAN NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH

154
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,150
SAUDI ARABIA AGAIN UNTIL WE GET

155
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:07,685

165
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:22,233
THIS GUY IS A WRECKING BALL.

166
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,201
HE HAD THIS GUY MURDERED IN

00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,202
CONSULATE IN TURKEY.

168
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,370
EXPECT ME TO IGNORE IT.

169
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:28,039
I FEEL USED AND ABUSED.

170
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,041
I WAS ON THE FLOOR EVERY TIME

171
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:30,908
DEFENDING SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE

172
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:32,176
THERE IS GOOD ALLEY.

173
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:34,145
THERE IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

174
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:35,046
COUNTRY AND INDIVIDUAL.

175
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,181
THE MBS FIGURE TO ME IS TOXIC.

176
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:38,716
HE CAN NEVER BE A WORLD LEADER

177
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:39,584

182
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:45,256
I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO,

00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:48,092
WE'LL SANCTION THE HELL OUT OF

184
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:48,526
SAUDI ARABIA.

185
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:50,094
WE DEAL WITH BAD PEOPLE ALL THE

186
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:50,394
TIME.

187
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:51,662
THIS IS IN OUR FACE.

188
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:55,232
I FEEL PERSONALLY OFFENDED.

189
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,434
THEY HAVE OFFENDED US.

190
