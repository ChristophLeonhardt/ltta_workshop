1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,788
AND ALL THAT AND MORE AT THE TOP

2
00:00:02,789 --> 00:00:03,489
OF THE HOUR.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,491
BACK TO YOU.

4
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:08,628
>> LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

5
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:09,228
SENATOR BEN SASSE HAS A

6
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:12,765
BRAND-NEW BOOK OUT TODAY

7
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:19,405
ENTITLED THEM, WE HEAL.

8
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:21,507
I LOVE YOUR CONCEPT BECAUSE I'M

9
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:28,014
SICK OF PEOPLE USING THE PHRASE

10
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:30,650
TRY TRAVEL.

11
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,351
YOUR MISSING WHAT WAS YOUR TRIBE

12
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,853
IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.

13
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:35,621
>> TODAY GET THAT RIGHT?

14
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:37,356
>> ABSOLUTELY.

15
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:43,195
WE ARE MEANT TO DO SOMETHING

16
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:44,730
TRIBAL, AND RIGHT NOW ALL THOSE

17
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,732
TRIBES ARE BEING UNDERMINED BY

18
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:47,433
THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION.

19
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:51,470
AND I WROTE THEN BECAUSE, I'M

20
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,605
ASSUMING IF YOU RUN TO POLITICAL

21
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:53,639
TRIBES THAT WILL FILL THAT

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,974
VACUUM IN YOUR HEART, BUT IT

23
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:55,308
WON'T.

24
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:56,342
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH MORE THAT

25
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:59,545
WE NEED TO REBUILD AT HOME.

26
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:00,680
>> IT'S UNDERMINED BY THE

27
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,782
DIGITAL REVOLUTION, THE

28
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:13,893
CANDIDATE OR THIS THING, AND,

29
00:01:13,894 --> 00:01:14,894
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T CAUSE THIS

30
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:16,295
PROBLEM AND POLITICS WILL FIX

31
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:19,532
THIS PROBLEM.

32
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,266
YOU WANT TO INVITE YOUR

33
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:21,434
NEIGHBORS OVER TO DINNER, YOU

34
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:22,969
WANT SOMEONE TO HUG YOU AND YOUR

35
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,670
OLD AGE, YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO

36
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,871
KNOW THAT THEY ARE REALLY LOVED

37
00:01:25,872 --> 00:01:27,073
AND ONE OF THE TRICKS TO THAT IS

38
00:01:27,074 --> 00:01:29,508
DON'T HAVE THE SMARTPHONE AT THE

39
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:30,476
DINNER TABLE.

40
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,244
>> HOW CAN YOU WIN AS A

41
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:33,746
POLITICIAN THOUGH IF YOU DON'T

42
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,281
APPEAL TO WHAT'S WORKING?

43
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:40,119
BECAUSE THAT'S A FLIP SIDE.

44
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:48,227
AND, >> THIS ISN'T WORKING FOR

45
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:49,795
OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS, WE NEED

46
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,697
TO DO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS.

47
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:52,598
POLITICS MATTERS BUT IT MATTERS

48
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,202
IN A CERTAIN FRAME, IT HAS TO BE

49
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,937
FRAMED AND LIMITED.

50
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:59,839
>> YOU SAY IT ISN'T WORKING IN

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,274
THE BEST POLITICAL ADS OF EVERY

52
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:02,942
ELECTION CYCLE, BECAUSE THEY

53
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:04,510
ALWAYS HAVE MORE HEART THAN WHAT

54
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:06,278
YOU HEAR ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

55
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:08,147
YOU SEE THE ONES LIKE, AND

56
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:09,849
HILLARY CLINTON'S ROLE MODEL,

57
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,283
POLITICAL ADDICT, THE ONE WITH

58
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:12,852
THE KIDS SITTING AT HOME

59
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:13,686
WATCHING PRESIDENT TRUMP.

60
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:15,321
LIKE OUR DIG IS WHO YOU WANT

61
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:17,123
YOUR KIDS LOOKING UP TO?

62
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:18,657
WHEN YOU SEE ALL THE VETERANS,

63
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:21,460
THE ONES TALKING ABOUT

64
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:24,964
HEALTH CARE, AND, WE DO SEE IT

65
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:25,398
IN PRACTICE.

66
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,432
>> I THINK THE CIVICS THAT UNITE

67
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:29,835
US NEED TO BE BIGGER THAN THE

68
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:30,703
POLITICS THAT DIVIDE US.

69
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:32,304
THEIR POLICY MATTERS IN FIGHTS

70
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,040
THAT MATTER BUT WHAT MATTERS A

71
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:34,974
LOT MORE IS CELEBRATING THE

72
00:02:34,975 --> 00:00:00,000
TROOPS WHO FOUGHT FOR OUR
