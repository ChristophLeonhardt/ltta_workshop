when you walk away from here I want you to think about the students who are consistently attacked by our universities and our colleges for standing up for who we are where's my tuition money going because it's going to pay for military resources and Israel to kill children just like me that was Noor alla Deeb chairwoman of Ontario's Canadian Federation of students and she's alleging with of course zero evidence that Israel is using Canadian students tuition money to slaughter children like her first of all despite her tendency to misrepresent and make hollow appeals to emotion al deep is believe it or not a grown woman not a child second the sad truth is the Palestinian children al D preferences are kids who are carrying out knife attacks against Israeli officials or civilians but the Canadian Federation of students doesn't only want to spread propaganda about the israel-palestine conflict know like all left-wing activists Aladeen wants to use your money to tell you that if you hold a different opinion than her you're also racist and Zionism is rooted in white supremacy it is rooted in racism it is rooted in anti blackness this is colonialism we cannot allow them to divide us we will not be divided a Jewish nation of Israel colonialism I'm pretty sure you need to have a country first in order for there to be colonialism and white supremacy this is just another buzzword but the Canadian Federation of students that sounds pretty legit right well as with many unions the CFS doesn't seem to be very popular among the very people it aims to represent you see the Federation demands that smaller student unions pay membership dues even after these unions have voted to leave the Federation in 2008 92% of Cape Breton University students voted to leave the Federation CFS declared the vote invalid and then sued the students when they stopped paying membership fees the Federation tried a similar tactic with Concordia University claiming the students owed 1.8 million dollars when they two tried leaving the organization and those are only two out of over ten scandals listed by Wikipedia which tends to sanitize entries that reflect poorly on this just listen to these students it's like a very bad divorce where someone will not let you divorce it at any cost their their focus is making money than they do in a poor job at if their focus is lobbying then it looks like they're doing a poor job of it too don't forget to vote no to a CFS but at this point the Federation faces challenges from a hundred and fifty thousand students nearly 30 percent of its membership this honestly sounds like one of those telemarketer scams where they get your credit card number and then don't let you pull out except this is a legitimate national organization doing the scamming but it's not just the Federation versus school unions members of the cfsr even cheating each other each check was supposed to have two signatures his and Hannam Norris she was also on the executive the check was written tuner for $300 and signed by Noor it also had Peterson's forged signature the CFS has more generally received criticism for favoring protests and sit-ins over lobbying officials as well as engaging in politics like BDS endorsement and supporting motion 103 condemning Islamophobia without first asking the students they represent what they think looks like these Canucks could learn a bit from no taxation without representation for campus unmasked i'm rob shamrock
