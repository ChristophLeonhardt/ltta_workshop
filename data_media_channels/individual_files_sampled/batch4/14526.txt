our bulletproof vests racist well according to NDP leader Andrea Horwath the answer is apparently yes have we reached peak racism hysteria yet in which the usual suspects see an act of racism perpetrated with every action or every statement that they do not agree with perhaps because as the NDP continues to go hard hard left now that it is the Official Opposition in Ontario this party is amping up social justice jingoism at the expense of the facts and for that matter logic here's the skinny newly minted Community Safety and Correctional Services Minister Michael Thibodeau recently went for a ride-along with police and the tough Toronto neighborhood of Jane and Finch as per protocol he wore a bulletproof vest and later at Queen's Park teabolo admitted to doing so personally I went out to Jane and Finch put on a bulletproof vest and spent 7 o'clock to 1 o'clock in the morning visiting sites that had previously had bullet-ridden people killed in the middle of the night well cue the outrage at the comments that he made in this house are nothing but racist because they are they basically stigmatize the Jane against Finch community and liberal MPP Michael too joined the pylon - noting quote I don't know what the minister was scared of end quote well I don't know of Minister tavolo was scared of anything but in the department of better safe than sorry it is probably a prudent idea when visiting a crack house at 1:00 in the morning on the wrong side of the tracks to done some body armor or this being Toronto in 2018 you never know if some random chap suffering from mental illness might happen to Swagger by brandishing a loaded Glock of course but it's a moot point any police ride-along even in tone neighborhoods such as Rosedale or Forest Hill it requires the civilian to dawn a bulletproof vest those are the rules this is definitely for protection and perhaps as a way of limiting liability but donning a bulletproof vest is not meant to stigmatize anyone nor is it supposed to be a racist statement in fact folks when you think about this preposterous reaction to teabolo just who is the racist here compared to the rest of the city Jane Finch has a disproportionately high crime rate so is Horwath and Coto connecting dots that teabolo never even dreamed of connecting that because the Jane Finch corridor has a high percentage of black residents that someone donning a bulletproof vest is making a statement about disproportionate blackness as opposed to disproportionate crime even if that is indeed the case may be it is Horvath and to toe who require sensitivity training at the end of the day tavolo should be applauded for venturing into the field in seeing firsthand what the cops have to deal with on a daily basis he should not be condemned for supposedly stigmatizing a community that needs some much-needed help surely nobody would dispute that point as for miss Horvath I say in for a penny in for a pound which is to say perhaps this esteemed member of the Opposition needs to double down on her virtues signaling by oh I don't know going for a stroll in the Jane Finch area in the wee hours of the morning and of course Horwath had better not wear a bulletproof vest or for that matter take advantage of a police escort because we wouldn't want to stigmatize anyone or any neighborhood right for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
