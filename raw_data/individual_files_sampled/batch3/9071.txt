HE IS CHALLENGING INCUMBENT JOE DONNELLY. BRIAN: THREE WEEKS TO THE MIDTERM, NEW POLL FINDS DEMOCRATS UP IN THE SO-CALLED GENERIC CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT. STEVE: PRESIDENT TRUMP SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE QUOTE, THE CROWDS AT MY RALLY ARE BIGGER THAN EVER BEFORE, INCLUDING THE 2016 ELECTION. NEVER AN EMPTY SEAT IN THESE LARGE VENUES. MANY WATCHING LARGE SCREENS INSIDE. ENTHUSIASM AND SPIRIT IS THROUGH THE ROOF. SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING, WATCH. HERE TO WEIGH IN, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND AUTHOR OF TRUMP'S AMERICA, NEWT GINGRICH. GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING? WE'RE DOING OKAY. THE PRESIDENT TWEETING SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPEN, WATCH. WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? I WAS JUST IN SEATTLE, DALLAS, DES MOINES. MY SENSE IS THAT THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT GALVANIZED CONSERVATIVES AND INDEPENDENTS. REMINDED THEM HOW RADICAL AND HOW DISHONEST THE DEMOCRATS ARE. AND ALSO REMINDED THE COUNTRY THAT POLITICS IN THE END IS A TEAM SPORT. THAT IF A CANDIDATE LIKE BREDESEN IN TENNESSEE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR SCHUMER HE IS FUNCTIONALLY A LIBERAL. IF SINEMA IN ARIZONA IS VOTING FOR SCHUMER SHE IS FUNCTIONALLY A LIBERAL. PEOPLE LOOKED UP AND SAID OH, I GET IT TWO TEAMS. THERE IS THE RADICAL LEFT TEAM. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT CONSERVATIVE JUDGES. WELL, NORTH DAKOTA WENT 16 OUT OF THE 17 LAST ELECTIONS FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. GUESS WHICH KIND OF JUDGE THEY WANT? SO THE KAVANAUGH THING I THINK WAS VERY GALVANIZING. I WANT TO MAKE A POINT TO EVERYBODY THAT IS WATCHING BECAUSE IT IS SO ABSURD. "THE WASHINGTON POST" POLL, LET'S DISCUSS HILLARY CLINTON'S SECOND YEAR AS PRESIDENT, OKAY? BECAUSE THAT POLL TOLD US SHE WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT. THE 538 PEOPLE, ELECTION MORNING SAID THE ODDS ARE 71% THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT. CHARLIE COOK SAID THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO LOSE FIVE TO SEVEN SEATS IN THE SENATE AND LOSE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. THESE PEOPLE WERE ALL WRONG. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT CLEARER THAN THAT THE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE WRONG ARE WRONG. I DON'T KNOW YET WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE HOUSE. I THINK IT'S A HARD-FOUGHT FIGHT. IN THE SENATE I BELIEVE WE WILL KEEP THE SENATE. WE WILL GAIN SEATS? THE SENATE. SENATOR McCONNELL HAS DONE AMAZING JOB WITH JUDGES AND AMAZING JOB OF RECRUITING AND FUND-RAISING. I THINK THE SENATE BASICALLY IN TERMS OF CONTROL IS OVER. SCHUMER WILL BE MINORITY LEADER. McCONNELL WILL BE MAJORITY LEADER. YOU CAN ARGUE WHETHER WE PICK UP TWO SEATS, THREE SEATS OR FIVE SEATS BUT WE'LL KEEP UP SENATE. BRIAN: ON LABOR DAY THE SENATE WAS IN JEOPARDY. 538 NIXED THEIR CREDIBILITY. THEY HAVE HAD IMPRESSIVE SHOWS IN THE PAST. 538 80% CHANCE REPUBLICANS HOLD THE SENATE. 80% CHANCE THEY LOSE THE HOUSE? YEAH. I THINK THAT 80% IS TOO HIGH. I THINK THERE IS POSSIBILITY THE DEMOCRATS WILL WIN THE HOUSE. TALKING TO PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON STATE. I THINK WE WIN THE THREE CRITICAL RACES THERE. I TALKING TO PEOPLE IN TEXAS YESTERDAY. IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE BETO O'ROURKE MYTHOLOGY IS DISAPPEARING. BECOMING AS TED CRUZ SAID THE OTHER DAY, COMRADE BETO, ONCE AGAIN CLEAR THAT TEXAS WILL BE A VERY, VERY REPUBLICAN DEBATE. THE GOVERNOR HAD A WONDERFUL DEBATE. SHE IS THE RIGHT PERSON THE POLLING SAYS WE'RE PULLING AHEAD IN IOWA. I THINK IT WILL BE HARD FOUGHT. REPUBLICANS WILL LOSE SEATS IN THE HOUSE. I'M NOT CONVINCED THEY WILL LOSE THE HOUSE. KEVIN McCARTHY, MAJORITY LEADER NEW PROPOSAL, TO FUND THE BORDER, GIVE US SECURITY FROM MS-13, GIVE US SECURITY FROM FENTANYL, AND COMMITMENT TO VOTE ON THAT, FOR DECEMBER, I THINK BRINGS UP THE ISSUE THE DEMOCRATS ARE MOST AFRAID OF. THEY'RE FOR OPEN BORDER, THEY'RE FOR SANCTUARY CITIES. THEY'RE FOR ABOLISHING I.C.E. THOSE ARE ALL TREMENDOUSLY UNPOPULAR ISSUES. AND IF THAT IS WHAT THIS IS FOUGHT OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, I THINK THEY MAY WELL LOSE ANY EFFORT OR OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE CONTROL THE HOUSE. AINSLEY: DEMOCRATS ARE TELLING OTHER DEMOCRATS DON'T MENTION THAT WHEN YOU GO OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. DON'T MENTION YOU'RE FOR OPEN BORDERS. HOW MUCH IS IT HELPING WITH THE PRESIDENT, WE SEE HIM OUT THERE AT THE RALLIES EVERY NIGHT, CAMPAIGNING FOR A REPUBLICAN IN TIGHT RACES, HOW MUCH DOES THAT HELP? I THINK IT HELPS ENORMOUSLY BOTH BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE THE BEST MESSENGER WE HAVE. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HIM DEMOLISH THE DEMOCRATS GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH PLAN OR LISTEN TO HIM TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS DESIRE FOR OPEN BORDERS, OR DIFFERENCE IN THE ECONOMY. THE TRUMP ECONOMY IS THE LOWEST AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY, LOWEST LATINO UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE TAXES, PUT PEOPLE BACK ON FOOD STAMPS. NOBODY SAYS THAT BETTER THAN TRUMP. HE MOBILIZES THE BASE. THAT IS IMPORTANT. IN AN OFF YEAR ELECTION, LIKE THIS, IN MIDTERM ELECTION THE BIGGER TURNOUT ON YOUR SIDE THE BETTER OFF YOU'RE GOING TO BE. BRIAN: 76% ACCORDING TO ABC POLL, REGISTERED VOTERS SAY THEY ARE CERTAIN TO SHOW UP TO VOTE. THAT MIGHT BE ALL-TIME HIGH. THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE
