the Pulitzer Prize has been awarded to both the New York Times a former newspaper and the Washington Post for failing to make the case that Donald Trump colluded with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton the prize comes with a citation to The Times and post that reads in part quote even though you didn't achieve anything you tried really really hard and deserve a trophy for doing your best after all winning isn't everything everyone who participated should get a prize and afterwards we'll all go to baskin-robbins for ice cream that should help you forget the fact that you've wasted more than a year covering a story that doesn't exist while people were watching Bret bear on Fox News to find out what was actually happening in the world so congratulations and here's a plastic cup and a ribbon unquote reporters at the times and the post celebrated by drinking champagne until they found themselves lying on the bathroom floor vomiting and sobbing over their lost journalistic ethics and their wasted lives trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin all right I am here in Phoenix in a Hilton Hotel I had a fantastic time yesterday at the Grand Canyon University I gave a speech there and the kids were absolutely great I call them kids cuz I'm so old they look like it's to me but their students a really nice university is just burgeoning a kind of a private Christian University couple of really interesting questions I will tell you about in just a moment but first we have to talk about light stream because I don't know about you but when I use my credit cards I don't think about money at all you know I just hand them the plastic and magically they give me stuff and it looks like it's free but then of course you don't pay it and you find out that the interest rates are somewhere between 70 gazillion and 14 billion and suddenly the things start to mount up but but if you're paying more interest rate than you need on your credit cards you can refinance your debt with a credit card consolidation loan from light stream light stream is a serious company it rewards consumers who have good credit with a great interest rate credit card consolidation loans

important information about limits on light stream loans and same-day funding all right so you know I'm not this university and the I obviously took questions I think it'll be online on YouTube you can probably look it up if you want it was a really interesting exchange and one kid said to me that his mother hated religion and she kept telling him that religious people only do good to get a reward in heaven whereas non-religious people just do good because that's the kind of people they are and I you know I was thinking you know first of all of course the premise is untrue that unreligious people do good just because they're them but it really is like saying you you know you're a fake you only exercise because you want to have a healthy lifestyle and look good you know it's like you moved toward God because that's where the joy is you know and that's what I was kind of speaking about I was speaking about the way that the press and everybody attack religion and they basically have a way of manipulating religious people who oftentimes are not press savvy media savvy into condemning things and to always being into the position of saying no should you do this no should you do that no and that's why you know religious people always look like kind of they're the Grim Reaper and not to mention of course Hollywood portraying them you know as the worst bigots and homophobes and all that stuff and that's that's the basic that was what my speech was about is why they do that and why that's happening in our society and what we can do in answer to it but it got me thinking about the fact you know since since normal everyday Christian American values are so under attack and anybody who holds them comes under this absolute onslaught from the left it's good to like observe the different ways that people handle them I was watching Hannity yesterday get hammered for this Michael Cohen story I'll talk about that watching Starbucks getting hammered for these two guys arrest and I thought back to chick-fil-a remember chick-fil-a where Dan Kathy the guy ran the place this is runs the place CEO came out against gay marriage he's a very he's a bible-believing Christian and doesn't believe in gay marriage and he said so recently the New Yorker I mean there's just a couple of days ago the New Yorker ran a piece called called chick-fil-a's creepy infiltration of New York City by Dan Pepin bring all right and he says New York has taken to chick-fil-a the Manhattan locations estimates that it sells a sandwich every six seconds and the company has announced plans to open as many as a dozen more storefronts in the city and yet the brand's arrival here feels like an infiltration in no small part because of its pervasive Christian traditionalism a New Yorker telling chick-fil-a is infiltrating New York with its Christian traditionalism its headquarters in Atlanta listen to this description this is supposed this is supposed to go with horror danger music so thick you think to yourself like bum bump bump bump bump bump bump its headquarters in Atlanta are adorned with Bible verses and a statue of Jesus washing a disciples feet bump bump bump bump it stores closed on Sunday ba-bop ba-bop its CEO Dan cathy has been accused of bigotry for using the company's charitable wing to fund anti-gay causes including groups that oppose same-sex marriage so anyway Cathy they there were protests remember people were dressing up his chickens and holding signs God hates hate and all this stuff but Cathy stuck to his guns he never changed his stance but listen listen to him back was back in 2012 so listen to him back in 2012 talking about why he felt the way he did this is a cut number two we're concerned about this whole issue of the family and how we define the family and so we just want to encourage you know our nation that hey God sets the standard of what a family is it's not going to come out of Washington it's not going to come out of you know some blog site but whatever that definition of marriage that we can hang on to that really is going to represent the stability of our future we need to be committed to it I'm not a politician I'm not a preacher I'm just a businessman out here but I just want to say that hey you know we ought to pray for our politicians we ought to pray for those that are the thought leaders you know we're really out here to sell chicken but if someone asked us the question of the Ballad biblical days our you know our testimony is they work they really do work regardless of the internet all the things that are changing all around us there are some things that haven't and never will change so he stood up to them he never apologized he never said anything he said these are our values and people lined up around the block now chick-fil-a is I think it's the third highest fast-food venue if you include Starbucks and McDonald's McDonald's and Starbucks and chick-fil-a which was not as big as the time because he stood up to them I mean he didn't spit in their eye he was kind about it he was just insistent that this is where he stood he did overtime moderate his tone because he's a Christian man right he wasn't trying to spew hate he wasn't trying to say you know the Bible says there's no yes and no and in Jesus it's all yes and he wasn't trying to condemn people he was trying to describe what a family was and according to the Bible and what it isn't and that is what he was trying to say so later they interviewed him just a few months ago and you know his tongue he still maintains exactly what he maintained before he's never lost his principles but he moderated his tone a little bit to make it clear what he was saying now that he had won they face off so he was that that more recent quote I've been able to reach out to to people in the gay community and sit down and have some incredibly wonderful dialogue with them I tend to like to find the things that we can agree on and as an example a friend that I've gotten to know up in Charlotte North Carolina now we find that this issue of bullying and saying demeaning things about people because of a whole wide range of different things that we can try to pick at each other not Washington is a pretty good job of it not focusing on mountain of minors and things that we should you know just let's move on to the important stuff so I've been able to do that with this friend and as a result this opened up a great dialogue and together we say hey we're going to be honorable and we're going to be respectful of everyone that's that's a beautiful thing right the guy stands up for his principles he wins the day because he doesn't back down he's not panicked he's stays exactly where he is people show up because they respect him and some of them share their principle I'm sure just like the chicken sandwiches and then he can say you know it's not about hatred it's not about no it is about yes it is about welcoming people and being respectful of people but it's also about not changing the definition of something just because the government says so when the Bible says something differently that is a beautiful thing in my opinion to compare that now to what's happening at Starbucks in Philadelphia but before we talk about that let us talk about my teeth because I know as I'm talking you can barely think for looking at my teeth and saying wow how do they get like that they get like that because I consulted my dental hygienist and she told me it got to use an electric toothbrush and the problem with electric toothbrushes is they're huge but not quick now usually when I talk about quip I do not have a visual aide but because I'm traveling of course I have it with me here is my quip it is a

when you take your ease I so Starbucks Philadelphia to black guys come in they don't buy anything they want to use the bathroom the manager says to him you know you're not allowed to our policy is you're not allowed to use the bathroom without buying something he asks them to leave because they say they're waiting for a meeting the police come in and he calls the police and the police come in and escort them out and it gets caught on video and this becomes a big deal okay so the they're protesting they're boycotting and here's here is the police chief Richard Ross and Philadelphia describing the incident as he saw they had seen these two males come in they sat down and after being seated they decided that they needed to use the restroom Starbucks said that according to their company policy they do not allow non paying members or non paying of people at the public to come in and and use the restroom and so they then asked these two males to leave these two males refused to leave and the police were called now when the police were summoned to the scene they get there and they get this story that I just began to outline they then approached the male's they asked the males to leave because they're being asked to leave by Starbucks employees in fact in an effort to quell the situation officers actually called for a supervisor so that it would not get out of hand something that was a good decision and three different occasions the officers asked the male's politely to leave the location because they were being asked to leave by employees because they were trespassed so of course this is a racial game right that two black men they're arrested for sitting while black people are going in there with megaphones and screaming there they're protesting outside they're threatening a boycott the lawyer for the guys were arrested Melissa de Pino comes out she immediately plays the race card here's her quick take these guys were doing what people do every single day they were having a meeting and they were undoubtedly singled out because of their race undoubtedly if you say it like that undoubtedly that means there's no doubt undoubtedly okay Starbucks collapses they fire the manager or likely at least they say he's no longer working there so I guess they give him the boot they start upon our hearts were broken here's the CEO apologizing falling all over himself apologizing in this particular case the local practice of asking someone who is not a customer to leave the store and unfortunately then followed by a call to the police now certainly there are some situations where the call to police is justified situations where there's violence or threats or disruption in this case none of that existed these two gentlemen did not deserve what happened and we are accountable I am accountable it's like it's gonna be sensitivity training for anyone I call BS okay I don't know what happened I wasn't there but just use your imagination for one second okay is Starbucks in Philadelphia you ever been to Philadelphia san east coast city people there are all different colors lots of black people lots of people in between black and white lots of everybody it is a new and American city on the East Coast Philadelphia Starbucks you think there are no other black people in Starbucks you think that place you think that they hire bigots who have harassed their customers because of the color of their skin absolutely not something what were these two guys doing that made them different maybe the manager overreacted because they were giving him a hard time maybe they were overacting because he looked these these are the rules they've got to fire the rules and by the way why don't they have to follow the rules why shouldn't they follow the rules like everybody else I am Telling You I am Telling You there is no such thing as an all-white Starbucks in the middle of Philadelphia there are people streaming in and out there all the time I want to know what these guys did now there not arrested they're not charged it's not going to come out but it's going to be really interesting to see as this story goes on what's gonna be interesting is the moment when it disappears from the news media because it no longer serves the narrative of a racial of a racist America you know that's gonna be really interesting you just watch it'll be there for a couple of days they'll be protests and of course apologizing does nothing right it does nothing they don't accept the apology just like with Laura Ingraham she apologized but luckily Fox stood up for her when she was going when she insulted that Nazi teenager who hates guns I shouldn't go I apologize I god I'm so sorry I don't apologize but I you know that that teenager hates country insulted him she took it back but he wouldn't accept the apology Fox stood by her and now her ratings have skyrocketed which brings me to Sean Hannity so yesterday Michael Kohn Donald Trump's personal attorney is in court and he is trying to keep them from revealing all the documents they got which he says violates lawyer-client privilege and the judge is a friend of Bill and Hillary presided over George Soros's wedding they called her the love judge in New York because she was caught in an affair with a businessman so Cohn is trying to protect the names of his clients he's got three clay says he's got three clients last year one was Donald Trump and then this guy Elliot Brody who was a venture capitalist and the former deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee what he's doing he's paying off girls for these guys right and he who's the third guy and he says the third guy is sean hannity and apparently there is an audible gasp in the courtroom and the media goes bass hannity to make fun of them just to make fun of them hannity just strung together all the times he was mentioned in a single day has got 12 he stood up and he said the name sean hannity how didn't he say it was it like Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity ton Hannity entity an identity candidate on Hannity Sean Hannity's in the entity Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity John Hannity on Hannity Hannity Hannity Sean Hannity on Hannity on Hannity tarney Hannity Sean Hannity Hannity vanity of vanities Sean Hannity Sean Hannity got Hannity cash on Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity con Hannity and Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Sean Hannity Hannity Sean Hannity con Hannity Sean Hannity so of course you know the comedians go absolutely bonkers right they they hate him so much Jimmy Kimmel hates of Stephen Colbert hates him Stephen Colbert really sank low here is Colbert's piece Cohen only has two which raises the obvious question who does Sean Hannity have sex with now we don't know and I can't prove this but I think it's that football he's always holding yeah every commercial break he's got his hands all over it mmm daddy wants some pigskin you know the other day there was a piece in I think it was in the New York Times a former newspaper used to be a newspaper by Kevin you guy named Kevin you why you and he was watching Roseanne and they had a funny joke on Roseanne Roseanne and and her husband Dan or wake up after they pass out on the couch and they say they've missed all that and dances we've missed all the TV shows about black and Asian families she says oh they're just like us you know they're there now you're all caught up in other words the message of all these shows they're just like us and the headline of the story is Roseanne when a punch line feels like a gut punch if one joke on one TV show is a gut punch to the sky I want him to just imagine what it is like to be a conservative in America where you are hit every single day by every single late-night comic I will say this the Late Show did do one funny thing that really is worth playing where they mashed together pieces of Sean Hannity these are all spliced together over the years to make it sound like he was confessing so do we have that this is a Fox News Alert president Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Kohn is my attorney and I defended him right here on this program can anybody say conflict of interest a huge conflict of interest Fox News has largely ignored to put it another way Sean Hannity should be fired like yesterday that was pretty funny but I mean since every comedian is going to attack him that somebody's gonna get funny here is Sean Hannity explaining his relationship to Michael Cohen was cup thirteen Michael Cole never represented me in any legal matter I never retained his services I never received an invoice I never paid Michael Cohen for legal fees I did have occasional brief conversations with Michael Kohn he's a great attorney about legal questions I had or I was looking for input and perspective my discussions with Michael Kohn never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone that I was asking him questions and to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter Andy sorry to disappoint so many matter between me or third party a third groups at all and are my questions exclusively almost focused on real estate I said many times on my radio show I hate the stock market I prefer real estate Michael knows real estate so in response to all the wild speculation I want to set the record straight here tonight I never asked Michael Kohn to bring this proceeding on my behalf I have no personal interest in this legal matter so all over TV they're calling for him to resign and slinging insults at him Alan Dershowitz was on his show and really I have to say I was really coming off really well and said this to him this is what Dershowitz told Sean Hammond I really think that that you should have disclosed your relationship with Cohan when you talked about him on this show you could have said just that you would ask them for advice or whatever but I think it would have been much much better had you disclosed that relationship you were difficult the nature of it professor I'll deal with this later yes I understand it was minimal I understand but you should have said that and that would have been fair to say that it was minimal I was lying on the jump position because a you had to talk about Collin and B you didn't want the fact that you had spoken to him to be revealed and you had the right by the way not your identity I have the right to privacy right I do you know it's a complex situation when you spend with so insulting it was such a minor relationship in terms of Judas it had to do with real estate and nothing political I understand that good advice from an honest guy but but it's tactical advice you do it so you look like you're you know that you're guiltless you don't do it because you have to or because it's a conflict of interest if what Sean Hannity says is true and I'm sure it is if what he says is true there is no conflict of interest and as John Nolte wrote brilliantly today we just saw we just saw James Comey interviewed about his investigation to Hillary Clinton by the man George Stephanopoulos who said to Hillary Clinton I love you Hillary and was her operative I mean they're all Democrat operatives and so Nolte is saying let us now have the Sean Hannity standard where every single person who covers the news has to reveal his connections did did Barack Obama go to Martha radishes wedding yes he did she has to reveal that so he says nothing says now we got to have the Sean Hannity standard but Hannity should stand fast he should I'm sure he will he's a rock about stuff like this he should not apologize there's no point apologizing to the left because they're not out to get your apology they were out to destroy you and I think we saw a chick-fil-a we should all follow that example stand by your principles stand fast but if you feel that it is right to moderate your tone or say something about what you said go ahead and do it once you've won once your principles have lifted you above the the protest all right we got a break with YouTube and Facebook but even come on over the Daily wire calm and while you're there subscribe because tomorrow is

exceptional minds that shaped America's supreme law Joseph is also a contributing editor of the Claremont Review of Books a great review if you don't get it you should a former associate at the San Francisco office of Gibson Dunn and Crutcher where he focused on criminal defense complex civil litigation appellate briefing and constitutional law he has written for the New York Times The Wall Street Journal National Review Los Angeles Times we had a really good talk about the Constitution here it is all right Joseph Tartakovsky thank you for being here it's good to see it great to see you thanks for having me Andrew so your book is called the lives of the Constitution ten exceptional minds that shaped America's supreme law why the lives of the Constitution claimed the title I wanted to tell the story of Americans journeys under the Constitution we've had 230 years now longer than any people on earth and most constitutional histories are a series of Supreme Court decisions or theories of the Constitution but the the story of the Constitution is the story of the American people so I picked 10 people who made extraordinary contributions in one way or another from the from before the founding to the present day and that they all came from very different places Scottish immigrants like alex' Wilson at the founding I have a black female journalist who was at her peak in the 1880s 1890's all the way to Scalia and so very different circumstances but they all show in various ways how we've overcome our constitutional challenges over the centuries and the lessons are important because I find that these same clashes keep reoccurring the same class okay well let's get we'll get to that no a sec but let's start before the founding you mentioned what's his it Wilson is right he's one of the more obscure people that you talk about who is he yeah undeservedly so so James James Wilson is the most important founder that people haven't heard of hi he's one of six people that signed both the Declaration and the Constitution he was the driving force at the Constitutional Convention with Madison he was the first founder to publicly defend the Constitution after the convention in his he gave a famous speech that became the most cited document in the ratification debate and he wrote something called the lectures on law which was the first sort of constitutional law course under the Constitution and is it is just as good as the Federalist Papers mhm and it's the most searching examination of our American political philosophy as it relates to the Constitution it's always seemed to me almost providential the the level of the minds that were present at the creation I mean that were present at the founding is there something besides the hand of God that you think created the kind of like you talked about Alexander Hamilton now you create they've brought those people together at that particular moment is there something is there something in the American sauce that made that happen it seems that way because this this extraordinary I mean how the the concentration of talent that you had during this period is I mean to me it seems like it's something like fifth century at Athens or London under Elizabeth or Florence under the Medicis I have some friends in the in the Texas governor's office that are have been calling officially for a new constitutional convention I say if you can get that if you can get that many great people as we had during that era then I'm for it but you're never gonna have that again ever that's just what I said this on the air the other day we have this thing called the conversation where people send in questions and you answer them live and somebody asked about the convention of states and I said yes I'll do it as long as we can have John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and you know all the rest but people have been yelling at me ever since because they say no because of the you know Mark Levin very big on this he loves this idea but they he says because it takes so many states to ratify it wouldn't become a Belgian waffle of like a fatty our Constitution would come out as a thousand pages regulating the salt that goes into potato chips do you agree with that I just I have to ask cuz you bring it up in it just I'm in this kind of fire fight about it right this minute it's too risky the Constitution has has served us the Constitution has served us so well we've entered our third century under the Constitution why tamper with it and it's not just just they were they were learning individuals but between the time of the Declaration and the Constitution the American states had ratified seventeen different constitutions in the States so what these people had in particular was experience in creating constitutional orders and that's what they brought to Philadelphia they had they had experimented so Benjamin Franklin had had created a contest he was the chair of the Philadelphia Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention their constitution of 1776 had a 12-man executive so the the the the president of sorts was a City Council people thought that was a good idea but they tried it it didn't work people had experimented with unicameral legislature so these people brought this extraordinary experience and knowing what works and what doesn't and you could definitely not replicate that today so we're talking about the book the lives of the Constitution ten exceptional minds that shaped America's supreme law like Joseph's Tartakovsky let's move on to the Civil War you talk there about Daniel Webster guy whose name we he was very famous when I was a kid but we never hear about him anymore yeah I tried to pick some of these these individuals that did did contribute to our constitutional understandings but I've sort of been lost Daniel Webster was the chief protagonist of the most important constitutional debates in the in the first generation to follow the founders okay and that was a very big deal for him he he said he felt that that his father's generation his father had been a had guarded George Washington's tent among other thing they bequeathed us this amazing document and he was his whole life his whole adult life was just filled with anxiety that his generation was gonna be the one to fumble it away I mean we've been one generation so he had all he was involved in all the great fights about nullification whether a president like Andrew Jackson can ignore law he doesn't like whether the Supreme Court is is supreme as the expositor of our Constitution and it's a body of constitutional thought that is still so useful and he was cited Daniel Webster's arguments were cited 12 times in the briefs in the fight over the Affordable Care Act so you see how these these these fights perpetually recur yeah yeah it was the you know the the left is always hitting on constitutional the Constitution partly because so many of the founders and many of the founders owned slaves and secondly of course because of the clause that was meant to protect to protect the keep the southern states from using slaves as a population ballast essentially what is the civil war baked into the Constitution was the Civil War baked into the founding was it inevitable yeah I so I wouldn't use I feel like at the at the founding they the the consensus was that slavery was a bad thing that had to be dealt with and they didn't know how to deal with it now some of the founders were confirmed slave owners and and we're unwilling to give up the institution but a lot of the guys at the convention were not amazed Franklin Hamilton John Adams these are key people I think that the the struggle that something seemed to have change in 1820s 1830s where the south started defending slavery as a good institution I mean not something that they had to figure out a way to extirpate but something worth defending but I explore that question I mean whether it was inevitable Daniel Webster tried Daniel Webster was responsible for the last attempt 18th the compromise of 1850 you know California comes in a free stay the Fugitive Slave Clause is bulked up this was like the last exit I can see let attempted solve this legislatively so yeah it it maybe but you never know what these historical things did whether they could have been avoided or not you mean yeah yes so fun to think about but when one of your the guys in this in the lives of the Constitution is Alexis de Tocqueville but a writer who seems to have been right about everything that he said I mean it's a kind of bizarre you can go back to it read him and there's not a false note in anything that he said what what was he what was he able to see that Americans weren't able to see why was his vision so clear was the extraordinary thing I mean you have this 20-something year old Frenchman he spends 271 days in America and then writes what is considered he came here with a skeptical eye he thought that democracy the Spirit was coming to France and he wanted to know what to make of it and how France would adapt itself but I do sound a few notes of dissent to the consensus again because here I I compared Tocqueville to Brice Jamie's Brice was a wasn't there was a Scotsman but he came from the United Kingdom and he came about 40 years after Tocqueville and his goal was to displace Tocqueville and for a while that his book American Commonwealth was a rival now we forgot a we forgot about Brice but I find it in many ways Brice was more accurate because here's Tocqueville was very good on American culture but he didn't care all that much about our institutions in our legal institutions he doesn't say that much about our Constitution he doesn't say anything about American literature universities he doesn't talk about these emblems of early American asite railroads banking manufacturing so he did I think miss a lot about America and what he missed is particularly tied to the way our our our constitutional framework influences how Americans behave the you know you you talk about Woodrow Wilson I was talking about him earlier this week what I guess will be last week when we play this a this idea that the Constitution was as FDR said a kind of horse and buggy document that it no longer suitable for the 20th century that it was a it limited the president from being the big man as Woodrow Wilson would say was that a new thought or had that been there from the beginning was that a germ that was just kind of coming to fruition with Wilson or did he bring that out of nowhere well I find that on the question you asked about where the Constitution prevents the present from being a big man Woodrow Wilson is very interesting on this point now Steve I'll give you one example Thomas Jefferson stopped the practice of the president going to speak to the Congress in person he said this is what Kings used to do in England and I won't do it and so 24 presidents follow Jefferson and Wilson was the one that shattered it he went to Congress to speak in person in 1913 and his argument was not that the Constitution is outdated but his argument was first as a textual thing the Constitution does say that the President shall from time to time recommend measures to Congress so the president has the role Congress by the way flipped out when he came they said this was a violation of the separation of powers an illegal attempt to influence legislation and Woodrow Wilson's other argument was historical he said you know George Washington came to Congress John Adams came to Congress this was a good thing and so it wasn't as much a departure as you think and I find that that happens a lot supposed departures from the past sometimes are actually revivals of old and better traditions maybe we wouldn't have the State of the Union as we know it if Woodrow Wilson or someone after him hadn't and they used to submit the thing in writing and there were like 40,000 words the other little books but but but it does seem to me that Wilson and FDR felt constrained unfairly constrained by the Constitution in ways I mean I know that Washington was a ferret you know a strong executive and believed in a strong executive do this it does seem to me that Wilson and FDR had a new idea of the executive power is that wrong am I wrong about that no I think you're right and Wilson wrote two books as an academic making that point that the president had to be stronger but what I find I think that the best way to look at it is not that Wilson thought that the Constitution as framed made the president too weak what he was arguing against was the separation of powers as practiced in the 1880s in 89 this was a time of incredible congressional dominance the Speaker of the House guys like they called a Mazar Reid Joseph cannon they were more powerful than the president that's why no one knows the names of the presidents between grant and McKinley I mean they were yeah they were water boys for Congress huh interesting so he thought he thought that he thought actually well at least in his view the order the separation of powers was imbalanced in a way that departed from what the founders thought at least the founders that he admired most which were Washington Hamilton the Nationalists the the presidential power guys maybe not so much the Madison and Jefferson so he thought there was something to correct there now whether he was right about I mean it's clear that we've gone to a president that is it is something that with no one no one thought he was going to be that powerful because the founders were actually very worried she was accurate yeah yeah now let's let's finish up in terms of the people with Scalia I mean I I think we all remember the day that he died and feeling that something truly terrible had happened that's really something that the election that we were in had suddenly become much more high-stakes what was it about Scalia that made him so special he I think he was the greatest a jurist of our generation okay and there's just the brilliance of his opinions but what I the reason I gave him the last word and what makes him so important today is because he was the chief voice for sounding the alarm to Americans about the way that the United States Supreme Court and decision after decision is constitutionalizing questions that had been for the people to decide in social questions military questions welfare free speech religion national security I mean he thought this was undermining the self-government almost imperceptibly and he thought it was very dangerous and I actually I agree with ya that that is the the imp the constitutional imbalance that we have today the power of the courts in particular the federal courts you said at the beginning of this that at the beginning of our conversation you said that there are certain themes that have continually played out through the history of the Constitution can you name a couple to tell us what they are what we what we should be looking at as we go forward that there aren't going to be arguing about it's just to take what's in the news say take take take war powers you know who is who is empowered in this country to get us into military conflict it seems to have been the consensus that Congress would play a very large role Congress does not play a very large role so when so the president today was tweeting about we may we might strike Syria maybe now maybe later it would I'm not sure it was quite their view that the president was the one to sort of call the shots just on his own but we've come that way not so much as a matter of I mean the Constitution itself the text hasn't changed but the practice has changed so presidents have called American troops into war something like a hundred and fifty times without congressional approval or ratification and so Congress is sort of acquiesce and that has become essentially the constitutional law and yeah is this question of that we were talking about with Scalia of constitutionalizing ordinary questions this should be for the people is that something you see going forward you know is there is that fight going to continue yeah it will continue yeah I'll give an example of that so for Scalia the ultimate example of the courts of the court doing this was the death penalty the Constitution authorizes it in the court which is chipping away and last month the president said there should be the death penalty for drug dealers and a lot of eyes rolled on the left in particular I don't think the left would be as there wouldn't be less i ruling if they knew that the decision that actually makes that the proposal unconstitutional and as a decision from 1977 that said that you cannot execute someone unless they themselves take a life the issue in that case was whether you can execute someone for rape and this was the courts reasoning they said for the victim of a rape life may not be nearly so happy as it was before but it is not over and surely it is not beyond repair in other words rape is just not that big a deal death is calm it's just too much constitutionally now our culture is changing before our eyes on this point if people think sexual assault is a much bigger deal than nine elderly gentlemen did in 1977 on the court huh and so these and so I do find that Americans are willing to think about their Constitution they don't accept the verdicts of the Supreme Court always like take roe v wade for instance though yeah the the some of these fights will never go away and and and I think Scalia's warning is is I want to you know do my part to carry that forward I predict the lives of the Constitution 10 exceptional minds have shaped America's supreme law by Joseph Tartakovsky Joseph thank you very much for coming on really interesting conversation thank you Andrew great to see you I'll see you again all right and now it's time for sexual follies Millennials are having less sex than any generation in 60 years this is from an article by Tara barroom poor in the Washington Post its headline there isn't really anything magical about it why more Millennials are avoiding sex a new study in the journal akka archives of sexual behavior finds that younger Millennials those born in the 1990s are more than twice as likely to be sexually inactive in their early 20s as Gen Xers were and compared of course with my generation they are basically celibate because we went nuts here's a quote from the article the sense of caution sometimes manifests itself as a heightened awareness of emotional pitfalls for example many young people speak disparagingly of the messy emotional state love and lust can engender referring to it as catching feelings in other words it's not just sex there's no such thing as casual sex you know Tom Wolfe wrote a wonderful wonderful essay which you can look up online and it's called the great relearning and he talks about the 20th century as a time when we got rid of the basics people for instance in hippie communes got rid of the basics of cleanliness and hygiene and they started to develop diseases like scrofula and rickets that nobody had seen for decades if not centuries so they had to relearn that there was a reason we had hygiene there was a reason that we had you know washing your hands and so on communism the idea that we didn't need freedom what led to a world war led to World Wars and slavery and mass slaughters we had to relearn all these things and Wolff says that in America America's contribution to this absolute crazy idea that we could throw away the learning of our forefathers and not pay a price came in the form of a sexual revolution which led to AIDS and has led since Wolfe wrote the article to me to to us and some women that they're being abused and they're being raped and they have no recourse because there's no default setting at know what used to be the default setting was no and if you didn't go and if you didn't go to no if you went past note yes there was a reason maybe it was the man's fault maybe it was the woman's maybe wasn't anybody's fault and it was something you agreed to but there was a reason for that now there is no default setting at No so you know this is just part time in my opinion of the great relearning and when I say that I feel like a Victorian age is coming what I mean is I feel that an age is coming when we suddenly say oh yeah you know you can't throw away your foundational religion you can't throw away your foundational principles you can't throw away the basics of human interaction without paying a price that age is coming what the wolf said is that the 21st century is gonna be much more boring than the 20th century was because people are gonna revert to what they already know let's hope so because the 20th century was a bloody one all right tomorrow
