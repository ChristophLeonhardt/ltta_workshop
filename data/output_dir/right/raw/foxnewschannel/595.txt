ENEMY OF THE STATE.

64
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:33,164

BETWEEN WHAT MAKES US GREAT AND

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,840
FOCUSING MORE ON THE ARBITRARY

71
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,742
THINGS THAT SEPARATE US, THAT

72
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,611
IS HOW FOLKS LIKE SENATOR

73
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:47,979
STABENOW AND CHUCK SCHUMER AND

YOUR PARTY?

96
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,390
>> PEOPLE WILL NOT BE DECEIVED.

97
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:34,725
THERE ARE RURAL WHITES WHO HAVE

98
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:36,227
BEEN DISMISSED BY THE

99
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:39,463
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS DEPLORABLE.

100
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,631
URBAN BLACKS DISMISSED AS

101
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:46,704
WAS FLYING IN.

102
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:48,339
SENATOR STABENOW HAS BEEN AN

103
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,740
ELECTED OFFICIAL FOR 43 YEARS

104
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,643
AND BEEN IN WASHINGTON FOR 20.

105
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,178
HAS DONE PRECIOUS LITTLE.

106
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,147
SEVEN BILLS PASSED THE LAW.

107
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,949
FIVE TO RENAME BUILDINGS.

108
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:09,460
MAKING SURE WE GET RID OF

109
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,394
IDENTITY POLITICS AND POLITICAL

110
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:11,595
CORRECTNESS TO EXECUTE AND GET

111
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,267
SOMEONE WHO WILL WORK WITH OUR

00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:18,669
HELP BRING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

114
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,570
BACK TO THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.

115
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,172
>> Sandra: IN ADDITION TO THE

116
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:25,343
OTHER WORDS I READ FROM THE

117
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:26,978
PRESIDENT EARLIER RARELY HAVE I

118
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:31,182
HE IS SPECTACULAR.

119
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:33,517
IF YOU WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION

120
00:04:33,518 --> 00:04:36,554
YOU WILL BE THE SECOND BLACK

121
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:38,923
REPUBLICAN SENATOR IN CONGRESS

122
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:42,193
NEXT TO TIM SCOTT FROM SOUTH

123
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:42,560
CAROLINA.

124
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:43,661
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU?

125
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,763
>> I'M EXCITE I HAD THAT MY

126
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:50,735
ACROSS THE STREET FROM

127
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:51,435
MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY

128
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:53,404
UNABLE TO GO THERE BECAUSE HE

129
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:54,772
WAS BLACK, NOW HAS A SON WHO IS

130
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:56,474
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR OF THE

131
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:56,941
U.S. SENATE.

132
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:57,875
TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED FOR

133
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:14,258
BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THE

134
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,526
DEPENDENCY AND VICTIMHOOD THAT

135
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:16,727
HAVE BEEN FAED TO THE

136
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:17,395
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY

137
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:18,529
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A SITUATION

138
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,298
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT

139
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:21,766
BOTH TABLES.

140
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:22,700
WHETHER NEITHER PARTY HAS TO

141
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,835
WORK FOR OUR VOTE THAT'S THE

142
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:25,302
WRONG ANSWER.

143
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,405
I'M EXCITED TO REPRESENT ALL

144
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:28,572
PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN AND SERVE

145
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:29,740

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,417
COUNTRY BETTER.

152
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,684
I BELIEVE I'M THE BEST

153
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:42,520
CANDIDATE BECAUSE OF MY

154
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:42,920
EXPERIENCE.

155
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:43,687
DEBBIE STABENOW WILL HAVE A

156
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,523
RACE ON HER HANDS.

157
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:46,891
>> Sandra: WE'LL SEE HOW IT ALL

158
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:49,760
GOES DOWN IN NOVEMBER.

159
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:51,362
YOUR ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY IS

160
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,530
IMPRESSIVE AFTER A BIG NIGHT

161
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:53,264
LAST NIGHT.

162
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,432
