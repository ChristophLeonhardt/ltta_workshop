Donald Trump is not only attempting to do extreme vetting of refugees who want to come to the country he also is planning on doing extreme vetting of those seeking temporary visas now make no mistake vetting for temporary visas has been extremely rigorous anyway but Trump believes that he needs to put more teeth to this extreme vetting process and in fact last week he signed an executive order which got absolutely no attention in the press whatsoever so let me give you the details of that executive order so he signed this order last week and it rescinded an Obama era goal to speed up visa processing now some of you might be wondering like Oh speed up the process what does that mean that doesn't sound safe well the only thing that Obama wanted to do was ensure that within a certain amount of time people applying for visas would be able to get an interview that way members of the government would be able to determine whether or not this individual is safe to allow into the country so a 2012 order signed by former President Obama instructed the State Department to ensure that 80% of non-immigrant visa applicants are interviewed within three weeks of receipt of application so again this doesn't mean that you just let them in it just means hey how about we interview them within three weeks which doesn't sound unreasonable well Donald Trump did think it was unreasonable in fact his White House spokesperson says the president expects careful accurate vetting of visa applicants not a rushed process to accommodate an arbitrary deadline now there are you know unintended downsides to what Trump has done by signing that executive order he is negatively impacting innocent people that actually do add some benefits to our economy so for instance tourists tourists from certain countries have to apply for these temporary visas and if Trump is making it even more difficult for them to travel here for tourism reasons well then they're unlikely to apply or even waste their time trying to come here right so the tourism industry is already dealing with some of the negative or the downsides of Trump's presidency also keep in mind that we have a number of students who travel abroad they come to the United States in order to study if you lengthen the process to obtain the visa many of them are unlikely to be able to start classes on time and then finally there's the issue of h-1b visas these are individuals foreigners who are hired to come into the country and work for various businesses so this is not a business friendly policy this is certainly not a good policy for people who want to come here and use their talents in order to contribute to our companies from a president who pitches himself as the big business friendly guy let me you know let me tell you we're gonna revolutionize the way we do things in the USA and it's all gonna be about business and jobs and n is absolutely right I mean you are there's a tremendous business incentive here because there's research being done there's all kinds of business development being done with other countries I mean one of the things that technology has done is it's brought us into sort of an interlocking relationship with other nations and oftentimes we need those people from those other nations here working on things from an economic standpoint to help make this a more robust economy this is ridiculous you need a deadline on visas of some kind right I love that BER B's they're so good at that crap verbiage this administration you know you know some arbitrary deadline as though it's not arbitrary we need a deadline that's reasonable so that people can make a plan so that businesses can thrive and so that tourism which by the way is not an insubstantial business that's the end of this country so tourism can thrive so they're they're serious in addition to all the other aspects to this there's a serious business problem with this entire proposal there is and it's interesting because you know the Republican Party claims that they're very much pro-business but again this is gonna hurt businesses that do rely on these h-1b visas or h-1b visa holders to come in and contribute to their companies not to mention it's summertime right tourist dollars that matter so much to so many destinations for foreign tourists coming into the United States at this time of year are unbelievable and and especially from the southern hemisphere voter of a visitor tourists people coming from everywhere margin Tina to Australia to South at people coming to United States it totally changes the way that happens and does up that Chambers of Commerce so you're say it's winter they're they're coming here for summer and and yeah this is the timing on this couldn't be worse from a tourism standpoint and this is really where a lot of tourism dollars get spent and by the way let me just absolutely clarify what I think is the most important part of all of this right what Obama wanted again wasn't to ease the process for people attempting to obtain these visas the only thing he wanted to do was hey let's have a more reasonable time span in which these people can expect to get interviewed so they're still going through the the same vetting channels they're still getting you know their background checks done they're still getting interviewed everything is being done the way it's supposed to be done and by the way the Obama administration was criticized by people on the left for being a little too strict when it came to temporary visas for travelers and Trump wants to take it even further and so this is something that will run in tandem to the travel ban so this is separate I'm not the travel ban I'm sorry yes the travel ban it will run tandem to that and this is also very different from the vetting process that he wants to utilize when it comes to refugees so people who are trying to come into the country and essentially seek asylum because of what they're experiencing in their own countries it's crazy and by the way we've oftentimes mention what the vetting process is we give the audience details but for those of you who might be curious what was the vetting process under the Obama administration I have the details to that so an individual from Iraq for instance who wants to visit the United States as a tourist first fills out an online application for the visa before the interview information in the application is run against US terrorism watch lists and databases any derogatory information would be flagged for a specially trained State Department consular office in the US Embassy or consulate in or near the person's home country who conducts the interview for high-risk countries the Department of Homeland Security is involved to some extent at that point the visa applicant needs to show proof that a return ticket has been purchased a defined place to stay in the US and ties to his or her home country and this is something that the traveler would provide during the interviewing process if and when the person is approved for visa photos and fingerprints are taken before departing for the u.s. all air passengers coming into the u.s. are subject to information analysis by officials on the ground overseas and at the national targeting center in Virginia finally once the traveller arrives at the u.s. Airport an officer with Customs and Border Protection will have access to all of the information collected through the targeting center will ask the person for his or her fingerprints again to match with the original set and will ask questions again about the trip to the United States so again it is a lengthy process it is a you know long you know detailed process it's not like I mean I know that this country really thrives on fear right and the fear mongering by the right works to their you know benefit time and time again but no one had open borders no one said hey you know what you want to come to the u.s. alright no background checks no nothing just show up it doesn't work that way I know the Trump administration will have you believe that but that is not the case these were stringent they were rigorous and they were right right and that they seemed to be like I would say they're very few people would call them totally unreasonable I should also clarify that Australia before of course Australia part of the visa visa waiver program so you wouldn't need a visa anyway coming from Australia but basically painting a picture of that side of the world but when you get here when you get to this country and that is what you have to go through that's pretty rigorous and and I think that's sufficient in many cases and then those flags are raised but as you said Anna there's there's never been or certainly in recent history been you just waltz right into this country and and did you pick up your bag at baggage claim and go to your hotel or your home I think there's also an aspect of this and you see it in so much of these executive orders there's just an aspect of this that is anti-obama usko I mean I didn't think you could really govern this way but they really are governing this way if Obama's name is on something they it's almost as if mark just like you you guys both remember the White House Correspondents Dinner where where President Obama was ribbing Donald Trump who was in attendance that night and they were good digs but they were digs it's to me it's almost as if he thinks about that with everything he does he is that little boy in the playground that is pissed off at the kid who teased him and he is just gonna do everything he can now that he's the king of the playground and I don't I don't even mean that like facetiously America I really think that matters them III 100% agree with you and if you just look at the way it's that they're legislating and and they're legislating through a lot through executive order the the first order of business was to undo a lot of what President Obama had done and even in this specific case they want to change what Obama had have done had done and it's important because Ana laid it out it's a rigorous process already but the headline steal is making Obama's and immigration laws or immigration rules tougher putting teeth in in President Obama's immigration policy when you get that headline that's a headline that Donald Trump can warm up to and I mean it seems so superficial but in an election that was ruled by superficial messaging and in a president who is as shallow as they come this is the kind of thing that makes for legislation that he stands behind you know I think it's all about a lot about that anyway yeah you're actually absolutely right about that and you can tell based on the way headlines are written about this particular story because you got to keep in mind not every American has the time or the resources to sit down you know read every detail of every story understand the nuance behind it and so a lot of people are educated based on what they read in headlines and so the headline from the hill for instance says Trump quietly puts teeth into his extreme vetting policy that's a very positive headline and it doesn't it doesn't really give you a sense of all of the negative ramifications of what he's doing look nor does it even touch on the fact that he's not really doing much just at length but in the process that's not putting teeth in anything there's no creative legislation going on with that right but but again as Anna says it'll steal the clique right you see that one thing and you go yeah well you know one of the things I like about Donald Trump is you know he's made this he's pulling teeth into our immigration policies actually and these are the types of things that when you have executive orders you have to do because when you save them you're just saying them and then this is the enactment of that we'll talk about a few more of those later but this is this is exactly what your how you're characterizing the last thing I want to say on this because I think this security thing when you talk about the fact that they've sold security and that we're frightened I think that's so right and security security security is purely going to be a big theme with this administration for his entire four years that under that umbrella of security you can do a lot of stuff like take people's civil rights away so right now we're messing with people who are coming here no I'm not from you know wherever that is and I'm not from these countries that are affected I'm not I'm not I live here yeah but after 9/11 all of us who lived here we gave up a bunch of civil rights we were scared right I mean it was security and they sold us on that fact that hey law everything fell under that that was the Patriot Act that was exactly whatever the Patriot robbed worth or never goes away Robert Byrd in the Senate talking about how crazy creating the Department of Homeland Security was right when you think about that you know in the aftermath of 9/11 people standing up and saying that and you're not hearing enough about this stuff one of the interesting things I think from this was Rex Tillerson this hiring freeze he put in at the State Department right it's it's an it's almost a way to say we don't have enough people to process the visas it's a way of doing it in a in a backdoor sneaky way to say that it's not gonna hire we're hiring freeze so we can't hire enough right process that they've done it in a lot of different arms of government there are aspects of this administration that are I think really dedicated to that kind of governing which is hey we just don't have the manpower sorry right and yeah and keep in mind there are so many positions that Trump still hasn't filled in national security positions by the way so that that's something you should also keep in mind while he pretends like he's concerned about your nationalistic what he was really pissed about only eight people on Supreme Court you don't like ads I hear you brother you know how you could avoid ads for the Young Turks become a notorious member and get all the
