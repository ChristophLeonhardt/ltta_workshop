1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,290
This is A.O. Scott.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,340
Maids, butlers,
waiters, porters.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,630
In the 1930s and ‘40s, Hollywood
offered African-American actors

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,408
few roles beyond servile ones.

5
00:00:14,408 --> 00:00:14,908
Right away.

6
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:15,384
Wrap it up.

7
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:16,842
Was you asking for me,
Miss Allen?

8
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:18,380
The film historian
Donald Bogle has

9
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,530
called the ‘30s the age
of the Negro servant,

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,240
and the careers of
great performers

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,640
like Clarence Muse
and Theresa Harris

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,560
confirm this marginality.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,890
Too often these actors
were not even credited.

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,000
Someone’s going to insult you
today if you get out of bed!

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,520
The offscreen reality
was always more complex.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,760
However demeaning
the roles, they also

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,860
sustained careers
for performers who

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,260
belonged to another
Hollywood, one

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,020
that included behind
the scenes activism

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,260
and the ongoing struggle
for creative autonomy.

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,620
Clarence Muse, often cast
as butler or a porter,

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,690
collaborated with the
poet Langston Hughes

23
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,330
on the script and the
songs for “Way Down South,”

24
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,970
released by RKO in 1939.

25
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,920
The same year as
“Gone With the Wind.”

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,720
I know you’re trying to do the
best you can for Master Tim.

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,190
I’m trying to do the best
I can for him too, sir.

28
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,010
“Gone With the Wind” is a
regressive fantasy, of course.

29
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,230
But as Bogle points
out, its black actors

30
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,010
transformed their slaves
into complex human beings.

31
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,630
Hattie McDaniel,
who plays Mammy,

32
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,550
became the first
African-American actor

33
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,960
to win an Oscar.

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,150
But at the time she was
also harshly criticized

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,680
for helping to perpetuate
negative representations.

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
Oh, now, Miss Scarlett.

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,130
McDaniel’s complicated
legacy is that she made Mammy

38
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,140
more than just a caricature.

39
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,730
Hattie McDaniel
is the most famous

40
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,800
of three siblings who
appeared frequently

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,210
in the old Hollywood.

42
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,850
Her brother, Sam, had
more than 200 roles

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,060
to his name, many uncredited.

44
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,950
Their sister Etta can be
seen, however briefly,

45
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,050
in films like “Son of Dracula.”

46
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,210
Working within a white
supremacist system,

47
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,340
the McDaniels and
other black performers

48
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,860
did what they could to
infuse their limited roles

49
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,230
with artistry and dignity.

50
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,510
Even as modern audiences
cringe at these stereotypes,

51
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,320
it is possible to appreciate
the artists who played them.

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,660
And sometimes what
we see, in a movie

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,420
like the RKO Western
“The Arizonian,”

54
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,630
suggests a whole other
dimension to the story.
