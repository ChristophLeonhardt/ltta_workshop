00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,810
A woman suffering from terminal brain cancer
recently moved to Oregon to take advantage

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:04,960
of

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,179
Oregon’s Death With Dignity Act. The law
allows terminal patients to voluntarily end

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:10,690
their lives

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,300
by a self-administered, lethal dose of physician-prescribed
medication. She had to move to

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,000
Oregon because most states don’t allow assisted
suicide or euthanasia. Which brings up the

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,850
question: Where are terminally ill people
legally allowed to take their own lives?

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,210
First off, there are a couple things we should
define. Euthanasia is when a physician

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,530
administers a terminal dose of medication
with the exact purpose of ending a patient’s

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,230
life.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,710
Assisted suicide is when a physician prescribes
a terminal dose of medication for the patient

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:42,780
to

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,620
administer themselves. And Passive Euthanasia
is when a physician withdraws treatment from

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,860
a terminal patient allowing them to die naturally.
These terms are important to note because

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,079
they affect how you are legally allowed to
die around the world.

16
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,219
Assisted suicide is officially legal in three
US States and legal by precedent in two others;

17
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,100
Oregon, Washington and Vermont each passed
Death With Dignity Acts that allow their

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,720
physicians to prescribe lethal doses to terminally
ill patients within some general guidelines.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:12,720
The

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,770
patient has to give two verbal requests and
one written request. The also have to be at

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,130
least

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,900
18, a resident of that state, and have a terminal
illness that two doctors agree will lead to

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,159
death

24
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,020
within six months.

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,350
Montana and New Mexico have not passed legislation,
but their courts have found that

26
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,710
physician assisted suicide is not against
the law.

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:39,200
Outside of the U.S., this varies. The Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxembourg allow euthanasia.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,740
Physicians can administer a lethal dose to
terminally ill patients. Switzerland allows

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,140
legally

30
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,700
assisted suicide. Physician there can prescribe
but not administer a lethal dose. Switzerland

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:56,579
also has relatively relaxed restrictions and
as such is a hot spot for suicide tourism.

32
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,380
Up to 200

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,729
people per year visit Switzerland to be legally
assisted with their suicide.

34
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,479
Passive euthanasia is legal in Mexico, Ireland
and India. This means families can take a

35
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:06,939
loved

36
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,869
one off of life support or refuse further
treatments.

37
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:15,290
Many other countries are also faced with this
issue. There are physicians in places we haven’t

38
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,819
listed here helping terminally ill patients
end their lives. But the legality of their

39
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:20,650
actions is

40
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,590
unclear. With all of that said, it is worth
mentioning that in the vast majority of countries

41
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,120
doctors

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,870
will not participate in euthanization or assisted
suicide. It is either illegal in their country

43
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,040
or they

44
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,760
consider it opposition of their medical principles.

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,010
