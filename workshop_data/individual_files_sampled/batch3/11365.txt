hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report the report that drills into your mind and impregnate your soul with the truth that is very bizarre but we're still here at the Kaiser report comp Keiser Report off over there put a big hole under the this one that's why I had to cover it up I punched my my fist through the wall when I heard about something egregious happening in the banking system that raccoon that climbed to the top of us yeah you should you know zap somebody with a raccoon stun gun by the way it's Kai's report in espanol as well because we love our spanish-speaking audience about it hey well you know I I just have this headline this first headline because I liked the way it was written really New York Times the rich are planning to leave this wretched planet adios amigos get out of here I like that I'll tell you this we won't miss them the rich add nothing the rich are drained why because not that they're rich but the way that they got rich you see in the past people got rich by doing hard labor not hard labor but by doing stuff amazing innovative and creating industries creating products creates value this class of rich people is just wrong ta they're just finance there's their Ponzi's get it all Bernie Madoff it's the Bernie Madoff class Bernie Madoff is just one of a million Ponzi scheme operators and if you flush them all down the toilet the world would be a lot better off well this was about some sort of fifty five million dollar trip on a philip stark designed cocktails and retro-futuristic designed space shuttle that they're apparently gonna leave the planet so we won't miss them we'll be very happy if they go is that he designs a lot of stuff including hotels and if you go to a film start design hotel it's not particularly comfortable like they sink in the bathroom for example is shaped like an inverted pyramid there's no place to put your toothpaste so here you're on a spaceship with a bunch of other tops and you're all whining about I can't put my toothpaste anywhere and they get into a vicious fight they kill each other and they all die in outer space I'm Phillip Stark amongst them and it would good good good good well speaking of people getting rich in a very illegal sort of raunchy a way here while we've been in Ireland we have gone over some of the stories that happen - Kim Trump summit the you know Justin Trudeau's about brow falling off the raccoon making it to the roof of UBS and somewhere in America well David drum guilty verdict all you need to know in two minutes banker faces potentially a long jail term on conspiracy to defraud and up to 10 years for false accounting he's a 51 year old former banker of Anglo Irish we've covered the story remember he fled to the US I think back in 2008 2009 as the crisis was unfolding in the bank was collapsing and they they needed a bailout from the taxpayer here and he fled to Boston thinking he would escape justice as every all his friends here we're a you know being charged with stuff well they extradited him back from the US and now he's just a trial and he was found guilty by the jury of 12 or 13 people on the jury and he's been found guilty a fraud they found David Drum working in a Cinnabon alongside Saul Goodman from better it and call Saul with like what I introduced to the show that they're rich are planning and leaving this wretched planet and the planet of course is wretched because of the likes of David John because of the likes of Warren Buffett because the likes of Bill Gates because of the likes of Ron tazed in our economy because of the likes of Lloyds RBS JP Morgan Citibank toy bank every single bank you could think of that is very big and powerful well we are wretched here on this earth that they plan on fleeing and if they flee perhaps we can recover again like a phoenix from the ashes that they have left behind the jury of nine men and three women convicted the one-time bank chief executive over a series of circular transactions that made anglers deposits look 7.2 billion euros larger than they were in September 2008 he was also found guilty of false accounting in December 2008 when the bank published misleading information to the market showing those fraudulent deposits in the bank's annual financial statements he was found to have conspired with ex bankers as kc willie McAteer and john bow to defraud depositors and investors by dishonestly creating the impression Anglo is healthier than it was of course we had in america jon corzine who did similar based on what you're reading there in terms of making his bank look his brokerage look more sound than it was and he did not face any jail time does my balance sheet look big in these circular transactions yeah of course circular transactions or accounting fraud is the modus operandi for just about every bank in the world they this bank got clipped for it because it was egregiously done and they're very bad at hiding their fraud here in ireland because they're so used to committing fraud and not getting away with it that they don't even bother committing fraud in a in a way that would be less obvious but they're so corrupt here in ireland that they did it in a way that was very obvious and they got clipped well it was actually a little bit more the reason why it was so obvious that somebody actually recorded his phone conversations telling them to hide all this bad debt and to make it look they were called the Anglo tapes he was recorded on the phone and in that conversation he refers to the central bank and the financial regulator as that effing shower of clowns down in Dane Street so that's probably why if you upset just like Bernie Madoff went to prison because he stole from the wrong people here he's like calling these guys clowns and that they should just give them the money of the central bank needs to give them some money and make them you know whole rather than them having to commit the fraud of pretending the circle of I mean he's probably down down the pub you know just drunk and spilling nonsense to people talking about how the clowns don't a damn straight don't bother to regularly pay and that's the way it's done in Ireland for years and then finally somebody decided hey enough of these guys just ripping us off blind the economy's in freefall the housing market collapsed and Bono is still evading taxes in the Netherlands but you know he's one of now many who have been sent to prison his his co-conspirators have been sentenced to two three you know many years in prison why has that not happened in the United Kingdom you say that it's uniquely corrupt here but I would say it's the office that they've actually gone to prison I didn't say there are uniquely corrupted I said they're very uniquely sloppy and corrupt here in Ireland in the UK they've been corrupt for a thousand years and they've got it down to a fine science Isaac Newton is like one of the most corrupt central bankers to ever bit miss grace central Europe and now they have refined it to a very perfect you know you know they just don't commit this type of sloppy corruption in the UK that's what people respect the UK for them the most advanced to Christ Butler's of corruption they're the concierge of global banking corruption and they do a fine job at it but they don't do it here in shanty town Ireland that's why John Corzine got away with MF Global because he did it through London they are London AIG corruption the Lehman corruption once you run it they didn't come through Dublin or damn straight you know Bernie Madoff to do his corruption through damn straight Dame streets the last place you want to do financial corruption because of these idiots so here's some more people who are gonna end up in jail and I'm gonna read this headline because we're at money coffee and crypto coffe we spoke at crypto common because report card price report and a spot on the camera here's the headline shady ICO issuers are taking bags of cash to border US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jake Clayton speaking at a conference in New York said companies raising money through digital token sales shouldn't have any illusions that the government will treat them differently than firms participating in traditional stock offerings he added that the market deserves close attention because the SEC has already seen examples of fraudsters fleeing the country after persuading US investors to back their icos nine billion in ICS so far in 2018 any idiot who tries to court cross a border with cash more than 10,000 is stupid because it's just gonna be stolen but this is what I've just been saying if they wanted to get bags of cash over the border done successfully they should have gone to HSBC who's mastered the art you know they have a special box special boxes they created for the Mexican drug lords HSBC billions of dollars and that's not even allegedly because you know the British people make you say allegedly before everything the regulator's but in fact the HSBC has admitted they admitted it to Eric Holder and they paid them a couple billion dollars to pay the US taxpayer or somebody I don't know where that money went where do those fines go anyway like have they gone HSBC to commit their fraud they would have now be walking the streets in London and shopping it yes if you're gonna do be a shady ICO is sure you should do it through London because apparently that's the way to do it the way to do but the thing I want to bring up here it was not this has been a big topic at money confident crypto cough was these icy OS and whether or not the SEC is gonna go after them but that SEC chairman Jay Clayton said something very interesting he agreed with exactly what Max Keiser has said about what is wrong with the u.s. public markets it goes on to say Clayton also expressed concern about the health of the public US stock market as hot startups like uber technologies keep their shares off public markets he noted that the general public is unable to invest in an increasingly large segment of companies those awash in venture capital cash and other private funding instead only the wealthy get to invest in them so this is part of the wealth and growing wealth and income gap you've mentioned that share buybacks and then these the likes of uber that only the very wealthy are getting to invest in these as more and more as taken private well free-market capitalism allows for the public to participate in equity and enjoy the fruits of the collective labor of the wealth of a nation and if those equities are being taken private or they never reach the market through private money then the average person is not no longer participating in the equity of their nation the wealth of that nation is being withheld from them and you're rapidly approaching the neo feudal stage of lords and serfs which is what of course the people in charge look at Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett desire they don't want active participating politically aware individuals voting their cronies out of office so this is how they're doing it they're taking all the equity share older Rights there won't be any shareholders therefore no shareholder rights actually in the next episode we'll cover another executive at the SEC also said they have to reconsider these share buybacks because they they said basically it is plundering America and there doesn't seem to be it doesn't seem to be adding any wealth to America these share buybacks and in fact these executives are just using it as an opportunity to dump their own shares at a higher price so the market manipulation it was outlawed before it was I mean I'm sorry it was outlawed yes as a result of the Securities Act of 33 and 34 in that period and then they brought it back in to enrich a bunch of corrupt CEOs right well anyway Jay Clayton says that the fact that there are fewer shares available for the public to buy this is feeding the demand for these I SEOs by the ordinary investor well Jay Clinton should just basically follow the law in the securities hey we got to take a break when we come back more Jay Clayton bashing so don't go away welcome back to the cosmic port I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to Rowan stone of his n cash ramen welcome thank you great for thanks having me I'm great to be here yeah it's great to have you on the show and xem cash is here the name often I start down to Puerto Rico there was a lot of buzz about it it's a fork of Z cash so tell us why or when and then just explain for the audience out there what a fork is I mean if you can do that in a fairly succinct way sure so we forked back in May 2017 and we forked from Z classic actually and we did that to take the ZK snark library which is for zero knowledge proof so a fork is basically where I get table repo is cloned and then built upon to create a new project simple as that right okay and so how's it been going then cash what have you added feature wise so one of the first things we did was try our best to implement some level of censorship resistance so distribute our ledger as best as possible through a node network and then on top of that work start to layer encryption so all the intra node communications are encrypted so that was kind of the first thing we layered on top and we then started developing applications so the first three were a messaging application using ZK snarks so that allows one to wander ZK starts to kind of the special sauce yeah they're the kind of core privacy technology that makes a lot of what we've built so far previously technology so it gets back to one of the you know Z cache that's their kind of their call to action there it's it's a privacy and so it's in the same campus Manero right sure you know the privacy but it's kind of like an iterative coin and trying to take new technologies and so the other features do you have is the privacy is opt in or opt out it's optional that's what I was gonna say that's the big difference between us and say Manero for example so my narrow use a kind of jumbling technique to prevent people linking transactions and addresses together whereas we have zero knowledge groups which is optional so you can transparently send then or you can do in a shielded way that means that the ledger just has a kind of timestamp so you won't see the sender or receiver and you won't see the amount so in you know politically speaking now crypto has come on the radar of different governments different regulators different agencies and sometimes they would highlight these privacy coins and they'll say - or they'll say you know Manero and Angie cash and they kind of you know put them in a different category how are you guys reacting to that so we're very regularly painted with the kind of evil privacy coin brush however privacy is essential to kind of everyday life and without privacy it'd be very difficult to do business for a start and in a competitive landscape if your competitor can see the contents of your bank account and the contents of your transactions then you don't have any competitive edge so we're firm believers in what we're doing we're doing it for the right reasons and we're providing in a kind of clean transparent way providing privacy in a transparent way there you go so censorship resistance is one of them you know the keys super important points here yeah it's such a part of the Bible of Bitcoin of course Center ship resistance and immutability and other features of it is what defines it and it didn't have the kind of privacy features that some thought that they can improve upon because of course everything is transparently on the blockchain sure so you know you can it's a terrible place to do crime actually because the record of it yeah if that were your intention but censorship resistance and privacy its hard-coded into the Constitution of the United States great we have this right we haven't human right so in the case of money in the white paper it says a peer-to-peer network for cash does that refer to an attempt to compete with Visa or is it the refer to an attempt to recreate the anonymity of a cash transaction using paper money your thoughts so it's both so ultimately we want to make xancash as usable as physically possible and to do that we need to be total as far as transactional through peer goes with likes a visa to we have any kind of mass-market impact and make it really useful and but we also want to really implement the ability to create transpire or create confidential transactions as well as transparency because I mean you know Bitcoin has a little scaling debate and you know it's slow to scale and then all these old coins came into existence sure and so because it seems a bit of the missions are at odds with each other it's like you can't have one without the other I know but anyway that's that's the goal right now let's let's get into a bit of controversy here so you were hit with a 51% attack we were indeed yes this has been you know talked about it feared in the Bitcoin community for years yep so now you know it's happening so to explain to the audience what a 51% attack is and talk a little bit what happened and then what was the reaction yeah so on June the second and we were already monitoring our blockchain so there are a number of rental hash parasites in circulation just now and the amount of available harsh power for our network has hugely mushroomed because of that were kind of on high alert so a 51% attack is where someone controls the majority of the network and through that control they're able to inject fraudulent blocks into the chain and by doing that they can effectively undo transactions they create on the main chain so the kind of Satoshi consensus is that the if two miners find blocks at the same time whoever built some builds a block on top of their chain first becomes the legitimate chain so if you can amass enough hash power to do that a faster rate than the main net of any proof-of-work coin then you can effectively attack it in that way which is a pretty large vulnerability and it's a vulnerability that hasn't been tackled for any real proof-of-work coin and anything Bitcoin derived has the same vulnerability if you like and so things have changed massively when Satoshi wrote that paper everybody was mining on CPUs and small GPUs that it was very decentralized and even as Bitcoin started to grow the capital cost of launching an attack would be so big that it the incentives weren't really there yeah take a step back put this into perspective so when Bitcoin was launched it was open to a 51% attack if anyone like thought this would amount to anything the charm of Bitcoin in the early ears was that nobody thought it would be anything exactly it's just geek money it's like magic internet when a magic internet money and it's like we're not even gonna spend five dollars hacking this thing because it's garbage yeah right so then it but it kept growing and growing and adoption hashing the hashing power kept growing and that's the key to all this stuff is that now you've got Bitcoin with how many hashes per second great yeah XO hash you know they have to create new prefixes to describe how much power it's the biggest computer ever created ever it is a massive super-psyched hashing out every ten minutes right there knocking out these blocks so they can't be attacked at this point because they were too stupid to attack it before but now the cats out of the bag so that you can look at all these different coins and you can say aha Zen cache you know for X number of dollars it makes sense there's an arbitrage here I can rent a bunch of hash power I can control the network where I can inject fraudulent blocks so what did you guys do to deal with this so we're really lucky we've got an amazing team so we swung into action immediately worked all through the night alerting all of our partners exchangers merchants to raise the number of confirmations required to receive Zen and what I've done is ensure that somebody controlling our or controlling the majority of hash power for three or four hours wouldn't be able to have enough to actually alive transactions to go through so we've raised it from 12 to a hundred and that gave us a kind of comfort barrier to prevent further attacks is there a way to build in a feature that automatically increases the number of confirmations based on some kind of activity on the network so to be a consultant on Zen cash in a moment at this rate welcome but can't can't can't that be built into the system like if you see certain outside influences building the network recognizes that and confirmation time scale to the number of times it would defeat that attack right we're gonna tackle it slightly differently and so what we're gonna do so the reason that they were able to execute without us really having a finger on the pulse and seeing it happen in live was that they were able to mine privately that's a feature of Bitcoin and it's a feature that's kind of went down to every other coin so we want to try and find a way to prevent people mining in private delaying the broadcast of their blocks and then basically surgically implanting them in Chains whenever they want to do it to come to their transactions and we're gonna have a block penalty for delayed block injections and then further down the line we're gonna try and look to leverage our secure node Network and because we have a huge network of nodes probably how many developers again so we have a team of 53 people or about half of them are developed and how does it take to put in a fix like that it's gonna take us probably a couple of months through the short to mid-term solution and the longer-term solution of using our nodes is kind of no trees it's probably gonna take more like a year that's a really long term fix but they can you licensed this out to other coins there's several problems it's not a bug but a feature so we're a fork we owe it to the open source community totally would but I think it's a really important thing for not just us but for the whole proof-of-work whole ecosystem really these attacks have a huge impact on everything they they spread and it's not good for the industry media picks up on and says AHA we told you these things are vulnerable they're not safe and it begins a whole cycle of doubt again exactly and the industry is pushed back so rowan and it's pronounced rao is it is row yeah I think you're actually the first American to pronounce my name right Oh what is it Irish I'm Scottish oh you're Scottish before we drive whatever whiskey Christie so okay you get it you get an attack like this it's serious business in the crypt our business it is so tell me about the culture ads on cash so you have to go rally around it as an organization right - in the valve there are certain values that need to be expressed so talk a little bit about that so we've recently completely professionalized the organization we've recognised that the industry is moving really quickly it's an extremely competitive marketplace and in order to really make the most of what we're trying to do here we've to ensure that we're surrounded by the best possible people so we've professionalized into seven distinct divisions each are headed up by really experienced leaders guys that have built businesses from the ground up guys have been in crypto for a very long time so we like to think that we kind of have a rough idea of how to operate and that's what really allowed us to react quickly and preventative measures in place against the attack occurring again but also kind of forward-thinking plan in place to help the industry as a whole circumvent and eliminate the risk of these 51% attacks okay five years from now how many coins are there gonna be in existence right now there's like two thousand when five years from now how many will there be the obviously what I'm getting at is that there's gonna be a lot less I think in my view but what do you think I think you're right I think you're right for sure the the ICO landscape is a Wild West people are throwing together really rudimentary white paper documents and raising millions of dollars and a lot of these people don't have the business skills to really do something with that capital this is not an ICM you just launch it like a Manero or a Bitcoin or litecoin right you're launching it out to the wild and there is no I see you know it's not they it's so it's funding via how are you funding yourself so it's through a percentage of block rewards so we have a new white paper that just launched very recently which is changing our block reward slightly notes you have nodes we have no minors okay so we're trying to distribute life are the lining goes to funding development exactly so we pay status and minors at the moment eight-and-a-half percent goes to the foundation yeah pays for event space for our enough isn't isn't so it's obvious to be enough it has to be enough we have to make two we have to make sure that we're responsible we have a full final compensation where everywhere where where where's the headquarter Israel decentralized absolutely centrist so I'm in Scotland and we've got director Scott kind I don't know I open the skull coin probably what should have happened to it to be fair in Puerto Rico with someone from son cash as a woman okay she was smart you're smart it must be a smart group we would like this ticker symbol Zayn is that en yep so I should be looking at it absolutely so that is my core holding in my crypto portfolio should be Zen cache for sure without any devil toll brow and thanks for being on the Kaiser report you're welcome all right cool that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert like to thank our guests Scottish Rowan whose last name is Stone you think I remember that I do if you want to catch us on Twitter it's cause the report until next time bye y'all
