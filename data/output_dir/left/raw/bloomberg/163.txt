EXIT IS GETTING TO BE ABOUT 21%.

81
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,544
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE

82
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:01,247
IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THE

83
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,014
PERCENTAGE CHANGES, IT IS

84
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:02,715
RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE

86
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,183
IT IS PICKING UP A BIGGER SLICE

87
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,954
SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT 21%.

88
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,023
YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE WHITE

LINE WITH THE INFOTECH.

90
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,292
OBVIOUSLY THE BIGGEST ONE RIGHT

91
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:13,626
NOW.

92
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,360
COMPARE THAT TO SOMETHING LIKE

93
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,928
FINANCIALS, IT HAS BEEN FLAT FOR

94
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,097
THAT GROUP THROUGHOUT THIS

00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,434
RECOVERY.

96
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,235
THE TECH STOCKS HAVE LED THE

97
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,037
WAY.

98
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,938
IT HAS BEEN A BIT OF A

99
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:28,608
TURNAROUND IN THE EARNINGS

100
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,409
REPORTS, WHERE TECH HAS BEEN

101
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,176
LEADING SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT

102
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,612
20%, 14 OR 15 FOR THE

FINANCIALS.

104
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,483
THOSE ARE TYPICALLY THE BIGGEST

105
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:37,917
GROUPS.

106
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,319
YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS COMPARES.

107
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,153
THIS LEVEL WE ARE AT FOUR TECH

108
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:45,124
IS A BIT HIGHER THAN IT HAS

109
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:45,525
BEEN.

110
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,325
NOTHING QUITE COMPARED TO WHERE

111
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,928
WE WERE IN 2000.

112
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,363
I WANT TO BRING UP ANOTHER CHART

113
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,063
HERE THAT IS INTERESTING.

114
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:51,998
LOOKING AT THE SALE STORY.

115
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,334
THERE IS -- THIS IS A FUNCTION

116
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,171
OF MARKET CAP.

117
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,575
MARKET CAP IS SHARES IN PRICE.

118
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,309
AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO

119
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,043
THINK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON

120
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,112
WITH THEM OF ITS BIG LEADERS.

121
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:11,484
AMAZON, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE,

122
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:11,951
MICROSOFT.

123
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,718
SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

124
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:14,587
BEEN LEADING THE CHARGE IN TERMS

125
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,388
OF THAT MARKET CAP EXPANSION.

126
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,391
THIS SHOWS THE DIVERSIONS THAT

127
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:24,697
HAS SHOWN.

128
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,668
VALUATIONS ARE HIGH BUT PART OF

129
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,102
THE SOBRIETY OF THIS RALLY HAS

130
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:30,837
BEEN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

131
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,539
STILL PRETTY LOW VALUATIONS AND

132
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,307
SOME OF THESE BIG COMPANIES.

133
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,208
THE YOU LOOK AT MICROSOFT,

134
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,876
GOOGLE, THEY ARE GETTING BACK TO

135
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:42,849
RATIOS DOWN TO IT AS CLOSER TO

136
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,216
ZERO.

137
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,983
YOU HAVE AN S&P AVERAGE OF ABOUT

138
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,350
THREE.

139
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,051
THERE IS NOT QUITE THE SAME

140
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:45,485
EXUBERANCE.

141
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,887
MAYBE THAT IS WHY INVESTORS ARE

142
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,589
THAT HE THIS RALLY AND NOT TOO

143
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,325
CONCERNED.

144
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,028
REMY: A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT CAUGHT

IN THE.COM BUBBLE.

146
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,336
>> THIS IS BASICALLY THE STORY

147
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,672
IN ONE SIMPLE CHART.

148
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:10,843
YOU CAN SEE WHAT WAS GOING BACK

149
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,377
IN 2000, 1999.

150
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,579
THE TOP PANEL HERE IS THE TECH

151
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,616
SECTOR IN THE WHITE.

152
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,518
THE PRICE TO EARNINGS IN THE

153
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,785
PAST 12 MONTHS VERSUS THE S&P

154
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:20,219
AND BLUE.

155
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,722
THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING.

156
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,456
THE SPREAD IS AT THE BOTTOM.

157
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:28,528
LOOK AT HOW HIGH TECH STOCKS --

158
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,228
WERE VALUED.

159
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,029
NOT EVEN COME TO WHAT WE HAD

160
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:30,396
TODAY.

161
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:35,735
YOU HAVE 20 TO 21 PE IN THE TECH

162
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,772
AS WELL AS THE S&P.

163
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,439
THINGS ARE BLOWN OUT OF

164
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:40,873
PROPORTION.

165
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,607
IT ACCURATE TO THOUSAND, YOU

166
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,308
HAVE TECH STOCKS TRADING 80

167
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,676
TIMES 12 MONTH EARNINGS AND IT

168
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,912
WAS BUILDING, HARD TO KNOW WHEN

169
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,981
YOU HIT THAT TOP THAT WE WILL --

170
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,718
YOU'VE SEE THAT FLAT LINE,

171
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,819
BASICALLY THE SAME AND I HAVE

172
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,090
ONE MUST CHART THAT IS SHOWING

173
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,691
THE SAME PRINCIPLE.

174
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,392
THIS IS LOOKING AT THOSE

175
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,192
EARNINGS SO BOILING IT DOWN A

176
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,928
LITTLE MORE ACUTELY WHEN YOU

177
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,829
LOOK AT PROFITS.

178
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,832
THIS SPEAKS TO THE IDEA THAT

179
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:07,633
RINGS ARE PRETTY HIGHLY VALUED

180
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,969
IN SOME AREAS OF TECH MARKET BUT

181
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:10,736
NOTHING INCREDIBLE ESPECIALLY

182
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:14,607
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR

183
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,341
NOT EARNINGS CAN PROVIDE A

184
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:15,741
BACKSTOP.

185
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,509
THE BLUE LINE ASSURING YOU THAT

186
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,612
TECH EARNINGS GROWTH EPS THIS IS

187
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,413
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE

188
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:20,813
LAST YEAR.

189
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,883
WE HAVE NOT GONE ANYWHERE BUT

190
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,387
TECH IS STILL UP, UP 25% SINCE

191
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,155
THE START OF THE BULL MARKET.

192
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:33,259
THAT EARNINGS BACKDROP GIVES

193
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,427
PEOPLE ENCOURAGEMENT AND WHETHER

194
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,831
THINGS ARE BLOWN OUT OF

195
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,298
PROPORTION.

196
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:45,204
RENY: THE NASDAQ AND THE S&P

197
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,341
TECH SECTOR HAVE BEEN UP 23%.

198
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,810
SOME AMAZING NUMBERS THERE.

199
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,477
TURNING OUT TO ASIA.

200
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,478
ALIBABA HAS BEEN ADDING SOCIAL

201
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,547
FEATURES TO ITS MOBILE APP TO

202
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,249
ATTRACT YOUNGER CUSTOMERS AND

203
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,219
GET THEM TO STAND THE APP LONGER

204
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,054
AND ENTICE THEM TO SPEND MORE

205
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:02,421
MONEY.

206
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,222
THAT STRATEGY MAY BE PAYING OFF.

207
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:07,760
ACTIVE NUMBERS JUMPED AND MOBILE

208
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,962
REVENUE IS UP TO TWO AND $6

209
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:10,730
BILLION IN THE JUNE QUARTER.

210
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,497
PEOPLE ARE VISITING THE APP MORE

211
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,499
THAN SEVEN TIMES A DAY SPENDING

212
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,769
OVER 25 MINUTES IN TOTAL.

213
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,372
COMPARE THAT TO NINE MINUTES ON

214
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,607
AMAZON'S MOBILE APP OR 16

215
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,011
MINUTES ON TWITTER.

216
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,113
SOME INTERESTING STUFF HERE.

217
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,015
HOW WERE THEY ABLE TO DO THIS?

218
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,084
CELINE: THEY STARTED WITH A

219
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:36,989
SIMPLE APP BUT IT HAS EVOLVED

220
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:37,757
INTO SOMETHING MUCH DIFFERENT

221
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,125
FROM WHAT WE THINK OF AS TYPICAL

222
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,993
AS E-COMMERCE.

223
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,030
AMAZON'S STATS ARE MUCH LOWER.

224
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,834
THEY HAVE THIS VERY YOUNG BASE

225
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:49,902
OF USERS AND TO HOOK THEM AND

226
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,203
THEY NEED TO ADD ALL THE SOCIAL

227
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:51,637
FEATURES.

228
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,675
A CONJOINT ONE OF OVER 1000

229
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,542
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, YOU CAN

230
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,243
WATCH LIVE FEED FROM YOUR

231
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:01,447
FAVORITE BLOG OR TESTING OUT

232
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,214
YOUR FAVORITE MAKEUP OR READ

233
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:02,848
YOUR FAVORITE NEWS FEED.

234
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,284
THAT IS WHAT KEEPS THEM COMING

235
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:10,656
BACK FOR MORE.

236
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,524
RENY: IT SEEMS LIKE THE NUMBERS

237
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,459
ARE NOT PLAYING OUT ON THAT JUST

238
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,227
YET.

239
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,496
DEFINITELY AN ENVY.

240
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,464
WHAT IS THE DISCONNECT IN TERMS

241
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,601
OF THE COMPANIES?

242
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,736
CELINE: FACEBOOK HAS TRIED TO

243
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,570
GET PEOPLE TO SHOP AND INSIGHT,

244
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,441
THEY HAVE ADDED THE BUY BUTTON.

245
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,144
SAME THING WITH TWITTER AND

246
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:32,945
INTEREST AND AMAZON HAS NOT MADE

247
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,647
ANY MAJOR INROADS INTO SOCIAL

248
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,114
NETWORK.

249
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:39,351
THERE IS A HOST OF REASONS WHY

250
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,152
THERE ARE THESE DIFFERENCES BUT

251
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:40,919
THE MAIN ONE IS CHINA HAS HIS

252
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,222
ENORMOUS BASE THAT IS GROWING

253
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:48,394
AND THEY ARE USED TO THE

254
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,195
EXTREMELY CRAMPED INTERFACES.

255
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,430
TO A TYPICAL WESTERN SMARTPHONE

256
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:57,837
USER IT WOULD BE OVERWHELMING.

257
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,671
SO BECAUSE OF THAT THE CHINESE

258
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,475
ECOSYSTEM THESE COMPANIES HAVE

259
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,209
AN ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING

260
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,311
ALTOGETHER, YOU CAN LOOK AT

261
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,847
REACH OUT, SOCIAL MESSAGE, BOOK

262
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,481
A TAXI, GET A HAIRCUT.

263
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:13,052
THAT IS WHY IT HAS BEEN HARD TO

264
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,853
CHANGE THE HABITS OF THE U.S.

265
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,888
CONSUMER?

266
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:21,026
>> IF THEY WANT TO PUT

267
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:21,794
EVERYTHING UP AGAINST THE WALL

268
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,996
TO SEE WHAT STICKS IT IS HELPING

269
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,363
THERE.

270
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,831
I DO WANT TO BRING UP A QUOTE

271
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:32,104
THAT YOU HAD FROM THE COFOUNDER

272
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:32,872
OF ALIBABA TALKING ABOUT HIS

273
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,539
COMPARISON WITH FACEBOOK.

274
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,240
HE SAID ON FACEBOOK YOU ARE

275
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,911
FRIENDING YOUR FRIENDS BUT THEY

276
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,446
START WITH STRANGERS AND USE

277
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,247
DATA TO FIND A COMMONALITY OF

278
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,215
INTEREST AND CREATE A COMMUNITY.

279
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,284
DO YOU THINK IN THE WEST THAT

280
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:50,423
THAT COULD MAKE TRACTION?

281
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,391
CELINE: HE IS SAYING THE

282
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:57,663
E-COMMERCE SITE HAS ALL THESE

283
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,164
DATA POINTS.

284
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:58,931
THEY ARE ABLE TO GROUP PEOPLE

285
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,366
INTO WHAT YOU BUY, WHAT YOU

286
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:00,866
LIKE, CREEPY.

287
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,135
THAT IS WHY THERE ARE THESE

288
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,969
FORCING SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS

289
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,606
FROM FISHING OR WEDDING PLANNING

290
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,174
OR BABY PLANNING.

291
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,543
IN THE U.S. AMAZON, THEY HAVE

292
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,546
NOT REALLY TRY TO DO THIS.

293
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,346
THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO

294
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,082
CHANGE HABITS.

295
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:16,916
I AM USED TO GOING TO FACEBOOK

296
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,584
TO TALKING TO MY FRIENDS AND

297
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,419
GOING TO AMAZON TO WHY THINGS

298
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,855
AND GOING TO TWITTER TO LOOK AT

299
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:23,422
NEWS AND TWEETS.

300
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,658
IT IS HARD TO CHANGE HABITS AND

301
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,829
IT WILL TAKE MORE YEARS TO BE

302
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,965
COMFORTABLE SOCIAL NETWORKING

303
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,935
AND ON OTHER TYPES OF APPS.

304
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,971
>> WE DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE

305
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,573
INVESTED IN SNAPCHAT.

306
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,007
HE DOES NOT WANT FOLKS TO KNOW

307
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:42,341
THAT.

308
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,010
THERE IS ANOTHER ROAD HERE.

309
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,845
HE SAYS WE DO WANT TO LEARN AND

310
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,815
UNDERSTAND HOW SNAPCHAT IS

311
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,516
ENGAGING WITH YOUNG USERS.

312
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,317
WE ARE INTRIGUED BY THE PRODUCT

313
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,086
AND IMPRESSED WITH EVAN STEELE,

314
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:54,854
THE FOUNDER AND WE WANT TO BE

315
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,888
PARTNERS WAS -- WITH HIM.

316
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:00,059
WHY DOES HE NOT WANT PEOPLE TO

317
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:00,459
KNOW?

318
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,794
>> THEY DO NOT WANT TO COMMENT.

319
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,929
THEY KNOW THE U.S. MEDIA, WE ARE

320
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,231
ALL OVER THIS.

321
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,800
ALIBABA AND SEPTET, TELL US

322
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,267
EVERYTHING.

323
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,102
THEY DO NOT WANT PEOPLE

324
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:17,843
SPECULATING.

325
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,611
ALIBABA IS A SUPER LONG-TERM

326
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,178
ORIENTED STRATEGY.

327
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,146
MOST OF WHAT HE SAID WAS OFF THE

328
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:24,250
RECORD BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS

329
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,651
THEY REALLY ARE LOOKING TO SEE

330
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,485
WHAT SEPTET IS DOING, HOW THEY

331
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,221
ARE ABLE TO HOOK IN ALL OF THESE

332
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,189
YOUNG USERS IN THE U.S. AND

333
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,627
MAYBE FIVE, 1015, EVEN 20 YEARS

334
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,361
DOWN THE LINE ALL OF THIS

335
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,296
KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE GAINING FROM

336
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,097
THE U.S. INVESTMENTS ARE GOING

337
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,265
TO PAY OFF WHEN IT COMES FULL

338
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,534
FORCE IN THE U.S..

339
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,470

TABLEAU HAS A NEW CEO.

343
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,415
SUCCEEDING THE COFOUNDER.

344
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,316
HE COMES FROM THE CLOUD

345
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,417
COMPUTING DIVISION OF AMAZON.

346
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:03,389
SHARES SPARKED -- SPIKED 5% BUT

347
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,691
IT IS A SMALL RECOVERY FOR THE

348
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,258
EMBATTLED STOCK.

349
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,795
IT HAD 42% THROUGH MONDAY'S

350
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,162
CLOSE.

351
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,563
TABLEAU IS TRYING TO TRANSITION

352
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,998
ITS SOFTWARE TOOLS TO A

353
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:13,832
CLOUD-BASED SUBSTITUTION MODEL

354
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:16,435
AND IS GRAPPLING WITH SLOWING

355
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:16,936
SALES GROWTH.

356
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:21,941
COMING UP, ASIA'S INTERNET

357
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,409
GIANTS MAY BE SCRABBLING TO

358
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,743
DIVERSIFY BUT J.D..COM'S LASER

359
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,344
FOCUSED ON RETAIL.

360
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,312
WE WILL TALK STRATEGY WITH THE

STARTUP IS HEATING UP NOT IN A

365
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,288
GOOD WAY.

366
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,022
WE WILL FOCUS ON THE INTERNAL

00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:53,339
HOUR.

369
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:53,872
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

370

â™ª

371
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,471
>> ONE STORY WE ARE WATCHING.

372
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,238
REGULARS SAY THERE IS A HUGE

373
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,206
DIFFERENCE IN THE VALUE IT

00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,808
PLACES ON ITS INTELLECTUAL

375
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,376
PROPERTY DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT

00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:13,378

715
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:44,649

00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:04,702
, WE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP

726
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:05,736
GROWING THE BUSINESS, THE

727
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:10,007
ABILITY TO GET UPSIDE IN VARIOUS

728
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:10,841

732
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:18,950
GOTTEN ACCESS TO.

733
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,953
IT IS THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST

734
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:24,956
ADVERTISING MARKET.

735
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,991
THIS YEAR, IT WILL BE A $40

NEXT YEAR, IT IS EXPECTED TO

GROW TO $50 BILLION PLUS.

739
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:36,000
MEDIA.NET'S REVENUE COMES ALMOST

740
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,337
ENTIRELY FROM THE U.S.

741
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,137
A SMALL PERCENTAGE COMES FROM

00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,872
CANADA, THE U.K., AND THE REST

743
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:44,575

744
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,409
WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT

745
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,144
FOR THE COMPANY.

746
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:53,217
TO HAVE THE RIGHT LOCAL PARTNER

747
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,018
IN A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA, THERE

748
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:54,752

749
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,089
ABSOLUTELY SCALE WITHOUT LOCAL

750
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,559

751
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,393
LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS WILL ALLOW

754
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,366
AT THE SAME TIME, LESS

755
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,867
COMPETITIVE THAN THE U.S..

756
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,604
RAMY: THE DEAL WAS STRUCTURED A

757
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,806
BIT UNUSUALLY, SOMEWHAT SAY.

758
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,607
OTHERS WOULD SAY A LITTLE MORE

759
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,475
BLUNTLY.

760
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,678
IT LOOKS LIKE A REVERSE MERGER.

761
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,379
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE

762
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,714
OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT.

763
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,548
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO FOLKS WHO SAY

764
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:26,150
IT IS A REVERSE MERGER?

765
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,519
>> IN A REVERSE MERGER, WE WOULD

766
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,589
GET STOCK OFF THE PUBLIC

767
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,557
ENTITIES.

768
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,525
THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING.

769
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,294
THERE IS A REASON THIS

770
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:38,062
TRANSACTION IS STRUCTURED THIS

771
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:46,203
WAY.

772
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,037
WE WANT TO TRANSFER TO A GLOBAL

773
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,773
AND SCALABLE BUSINESS.

774
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:49,540
THEY HAVE THE PLAN AND THE

775
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,511
FUNDING LIVE -- LINED UP.

776
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,613
BUT IT IS A TIME-CONSUMING

777
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,515
PROCESS.

778
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:02,686
IF YOU ARE IN A COMPETITIVE

779
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:03,454
BIDDING PROCESS AND HAVE TO GO

780
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,121
THROUGH A TIME-CONSUMING

781
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:04,855
REGULATORY PROCESS, THERE IS A

782
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:05,589
GOOD CHANCE YOU WILL NOT MAKE

783
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,890
IT.

784
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,492
THIS WAS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS.

785
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,928
THE ONLY WAY WE COULD HAVE DONE

786
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:11,595
THIS WAS THIS PARTICULAR

787
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:15,533
STRUCTURE WHERE THEY START A

788
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,469
CONSORTIUM, GET FUNDING INTO

789
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,005
THAT CONSORTIUM BY MEDIA.NET

790
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:21,806
ENTIRELY, AND ONCE WE GET THE

791
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,175
REGULATORY TOOLS IN CHINA, IT

792
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:31,582
WILL BECOME PART OF MCDONOUGH.

793
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,417
BASICALLY, IN A REVERSE

794
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,418
MORTGAGE, YOU HAVE THE PRIVATE

795
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:38,355
COMPANY GETTING SHARES OF A

796
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:38,923
PUBLIC COMPANY.

797
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:44,128
RAMY: LAST YEAR, CHINA MADE A

798
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:44,895
CALL FOR MORE INVESTMENT INTO

799
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,698
THE AD TECH SPACE.

800
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,735
SOME SEE IT AS POTENTIALLY

801
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:52,369
SAYING, WE NEED HELP.

802
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:56,974
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH -- HOW

803
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,775
FAR BEHIND IS CHINA COMPARED TO

804
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,309
THE UNITED STATES?

805
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,713
>> THAT HAPPENED FOR A COUPLE

806
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:03,113
REASONS.

807
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:06,016
ONLINE ADVERTISING AS A GLOBAL

808
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:06,851
BUSINESS IS A MASSIVE BUSINESS.

809
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,786
EVEN AT THAT SIZE, YOU WOULD

810
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,857
NEED -- $200 BILLION THIS YEAR

811
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,160
AND GROWING.

812
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,994
IN CHINA, IT IS GROWING FASTER

813
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,829
THAN THE OTHER MARKETS.

814
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:24,134
CHINA HAS NATURAL HURDLES THAT

815
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:25,503
EXIST TO ENTER THE MARKET,

816
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,438
ESPECIALLY FOR FOREIGN

817
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:27,905
COUNTRIES.

818
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,974
IT IS LESS SOPHISTICATED.

819
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,943
IT IS BEHIND THE U.S..

820
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,880
IT WILL BE A YEAR OR TWO BEHIND

821
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,881
THE U.S., MAYBE MORE.

822
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,983
AT THE SAME TIME, IT HAS A

823
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,253
UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES.

824
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,087
THE CHINA MANDATE MAY NOT JUST

825
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,890
BE TO GROW WITHIN CHINA, WHICH

826
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,957
IS OBVIOUSLY GREAT.

827
00:38:46,957 --> 00:39:01,105
THE OVERALL MANDATE LONG-TERM IS

828
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:01,839
YOU WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN

829
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,473
OUTBOUND INVESTMENTS FOR

830
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,274
COMPANIES THAT ARE GLOBAL, THAT

831
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:03,974
HAVE SCALE, A REAL BUSINESS

832
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:04,675
MODEL THAT WILL BE LONG-TERM

833
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,109
SUSTAINABLE.

834
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:05,776
THAT IS WHAT MCDONAGH AND

835
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:10,281
CHAIRMAN ZHANG WANT TO DO.

836
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,316
THE GOAL IS TO NOT ONLY ADD

837
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,117
CHINA AS A MARKET BUT DOUBLE

838
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,187
DOWN ON U.S. AND EUROPEAN

839
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:16,687
CHALLENGES.

840
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,256
RAMY: YOU ARE AN ENTREPRENEUR.

841
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,091
WHAT IS NEXT?

842
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,427
>> MY PLAN IS TO CONTINUE WITH

843
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,496
THESE GUYS.

844
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,531
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY

845
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,299
REASONS WHEN WE HAD SEVERAL

846
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,202
OPTIONS -- THREE OPTIONS FROM

847
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:36,374
THE U.S., EUROPE, AND CHINA.

848
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,309
THE HIGHEST BID WAS ABOUT 20%.

849
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:42,046
THE HIGHEST U.S. BID WAS FROM A

850
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,249
WELL-KNOWN PE FUND.

851
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:52,856
PE FUNDS WOULD WANT TO DISCOUNT

852
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:53,624
THE VALUE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO

853
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,325
MAKE UPSIDE ON THEIR EXIT.

854
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,694
FROM A VALUE STANDPOINT, WE

855
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,461
THOUGHT WE WERE AT THE SAME

856
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:01,832
POINT.

857
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:02,666
THE PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATOR WAS

858
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,969
ALL THESE DIFFERENT VALUE ADDS

859
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:05,669
IN BEING ABLE TO ACCESS

860
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,503
ADDITIONAL MARKETS, GET ACCESS

861
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:11,442
TO INCREDIBLE TALENT IN CHINA,

00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,410
BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL

863
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,578
MARKET, AND LOOK AT DEALS OF

864
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,513
VARIOUS SIZES.

865
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:20,484
ACROSS THE NEXT FEW YEARS, -- WE

866
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:26,791
HAVE COMPLETED OUR FIRST PHASE.

867
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,625
WE HAVE HAD A GREAT JOURNEY IN

868
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,192
THIS FIRST PHASE.

869
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:28,959
AS WE ENTER THE SECOND PHASE OF

870
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:29,693
GROWTH, WE EXPECT TO MULTIPLY

871
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:30,427
THE BUSINESS FROM WHERE IT IS

872
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:30,761
TODAY.

873
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,730
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT.

874
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,597
I AM GOING TO BE A PART OF THAT.

875
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:38,335
SO IS MY MANAGEMENT TEAM.

876
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,103
WE ARE GOING TO GET LOTS OF

877
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,536
AUTONOMY.

878
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:41,505

QUARTER THIS YEAR.

887
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,093
THAT IS ACCORDING TO SOURCING BY

888
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:03,794
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

889
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,698
IN APRIL, MEITU WAS SEEKING

AT THE TIME, THE APP HAD 270

00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:20,044
MILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS.

894
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,346
COMING UP, WE WILL FOCUS ON

895
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,080
FLIPKART AS A DOWNTURN IN

00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,847
FUNDING HITS THE E-COMMERCE

00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:25,216
GIANT ESPECIALLY HARD.

898
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:25,982
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

â™ª

900
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,661
RAMY: FLIPKART IS FEELING THE

901
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,631
HEAT.

902
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,966
IT'S A REGULAR TOWN HALL WAS

903
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,168
TENSE ON FRIDAY AFTER EMPLOYEES

904
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:03,674
ACCUSED MANAGEMENT OF BETRAYAL.

905
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:07,845
SACHIN BANSAL SAID THE JOB CUTS

906
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,013
STEMMED FROM POOR PERFORMANCE

907
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:10,814
AND HE LOST HIS POSITION FOR THE

908
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,281
SAME REASON.

909
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,816
THE PRESSURE IS ON FROM AMAZON.

910
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,787
JOINING US FROM TOKYO IS PETER L

911
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,924
STREMME -- ELSTROM.

912
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:25,629
TO WHAT DEGREE DOES FLIPKART'S

913
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:26,396
PROBLEM SHOWCASE THE GENERAL

914
00:44:26,396 --> 00:44:28,498
PROBLEMS IN TECH IN INDIA?

915
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:31,869
>> THIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC

916
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,203
MEETING, AS YOU MENTIONED.

917
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,506
FLIPKART HAS GATHERINGS WITH

918
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,842
EMPLOYEES ONCE A MONTH.

919
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,979
IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE, IT GREW

920
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,416
QUITE TENSE BECAUSE EMPLOYEES

921
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,283
WERE UPSET THAT MANY COLLEAGUES

922
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:46,917
HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS.

923
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:51,188
THEY HAD COME TO THE COMPANY

924
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:51,955
HOPING THEY WERE ON A GROWTH

925
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:52,389
TRAJECTORY.

926
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:57,527
SACHIN BANSAL WAS FRANK WITH

927
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:59,396
THEM ABOUT HOW THEY MISSED

928
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,163
PERFORMANCE TARGETS AND NEEDED

929
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:00,631
TO DO BETTER.

930
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,967
THE REASON HE LOST HIS CEO JOB

931
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:04,701
WAS BECAUSE OF PERFORMANCE

932
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,437
TARGETS.

933
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,304
HE IS STILL CHAIRMAN, BUT THAT

934
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:08,839
WAS A FRANK ADMISSION THAT DREW

935
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:09,539
APPLAUSE FROM EMPLOYEES.

936
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:12,009
RAMY: TO WHAT DEGREE IS IT AN

937
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,111
ISSUE OF FUNDING?

938
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:18,715
FUNDING IS DRYING UP THERE.

939
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:19,449
>> IT IS A BROADER ISSUE.

940
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:22,019
THERE ARE TWO THINGS GOING ON IN

941
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,288
INDIA.

942
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,189
THERE WAS A BOOM IN INVESTMENT

943
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,391
CAPITAL IN 2014.

944
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,894
YOU ARE SEEING THAT TAPER OFF

945
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,665
QUITE A BIT.

946
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,432
IT IS SQUEEZING THE STARTUP

947
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,601
SECTOR MORE BROADLY.

948
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,435
THE CHALLENGES FOR FLIPKART ARE

949
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:42,105
MORE INTENSE BECAUSE OF THE

950
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:42,839
TARGETING OF AMAZON INTO THE

951
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,209
INDIA MARKET.

952
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,344
AMAZON HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND

953
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,078
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HIRING

954
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:48,478
EMPLOYEES.

955
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:49,313
IT IS MARKETING AGGRESSIVELY IN

956
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:54,284
THE MARKET.

957
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,118
IT WANTS TO TAKE A BIG SLICE OF

958
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:58,822
THE E-COMMERCE MARKET IN INDIA.

959
00:45:58,822 --> 00:45:59,656
THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON FLIPKART.

960
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:06,029
RAMY: WHAT WOULD THEY

961
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,531
SPECIFICALLY NEED TO DO IN ORDER

962
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,298
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FLIPKART

963
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:08,765
TURNING OVER?

964
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:12,369
>> WELL, THE MARKET IS GROWING

965
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,639
VERY QUICKLY IN AMAZON.

966
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,577
THE RETAIL MARKET IN INDIA IS

967
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,345
QUITE FRACTURED AT THIS POINT,

968
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,680
EVEN MORE THAN THE U.S..

969
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,548
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOT JUST

970
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,350
SELL GOODS RELIABLY AND GET THEM

971
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,120
TO CUSTOMERS RELIABLY.

972
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,954
YOU NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

973
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:31,688
PLACE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT

974
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,991
GROWTH.

975
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,858
AMAZON HAS LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN

976
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:35,659
THE U.S. AND HAS DONE REASONABLY

977
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,528
WELL IN OTHER MARKETS, BUT THIS

978
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:39,329
MARKET IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER THEY

979
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:39,997
HAVE COMPETED IN.

980
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:44,902
RAMY: HOW CAN FLIPKART MOUNT A

981
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:45,535
RESPONSE TO AMAZON?

982
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:45,969
CAN THEY?

983
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,671
>> FLIPKART HAS AN ADVANTAGE

984
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:48,038
HERE.

985
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,541
THEY ARE AHEAD AT THIS POINT.

986
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:55,112
THEY ALSO HAVE DOMESTIC

987
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:55,979
KNOWLEDGE THAT PROBABLY WORKS TO

988
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:56,713
THEIR ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF

989
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,783
LANGUAGE, CUSTOMIZING APPS,

990
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,584
RECOMMENDATIONS MAKE A BIG

991
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,654
DIFFERENCE, TOO.

992
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:07,357
THEY HAVE A BIT OF A LEAD, BUT

993
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,625
THEY NEED TO CONTINUE TO

994
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,529
INNOVATE, EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY,

995
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,330
AND ADD MORE MERCHANTS TO STAY

996
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:13,864
AHEAD OF AMAZON.

997
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:19,937
RAMY: PETER, STAY RIGHT THERE.

998
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:20,737
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON

999
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:25,242
ANOTHER STORY, CHINA SMARTPHONE

1000
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,109
MAKERS WITH THEIR SIGHTS SET ON

1001
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,978
THE U.S.

1002
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,746
DO THEY REALLY STAND A CHANCE?

1003
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:35,085
SHIRA OVIDE IS NOT SO SURE.

1004
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:35,919
SHE JOINS US RIGHT HERE IN NEW

1005
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,255
YORK.

1006
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,122
WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT

1007
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:39,489
PIECE?

1008
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:44,728
>> THE TAKEAWAY IS WE HAVE SEEN

1009
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,929
IN RECENT WEEKS A NUMBER OF

1010
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,731
CHINESE HANDSET MAKERS SAYING

1011
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,899
THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE U.S.

1012
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:57,574
XIAOMI AND HUAWEI ARE GOING TO

1013
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,375
GO AFTER THE U.S. WITH HIGH-END

1014
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:58,809
SMARTPHONES.

1015
00:47:58,809 --> 00:47:59,543
THE BATTLE SHOULD BE REALLY

1016
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,010
INTERESTING.

1017
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,113
RAMY: THE INTERESTING PART IS IN

1018
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,182
TERMS OF SPECS?

1019
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:08,552
PRICING?

1020
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,386
HOW CAN APPLE AND SAMSUNG DEFEND

1021
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:09,886
THEMSELVES?

1022
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,055
>> APPLE AND SAMSUNG IN THE U.S.

1023
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,727
DIVY UP THE MARKET.

1024
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,594
THEY HAVE OUTSIZED MARKET SHARE

1025
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,295
COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE

1026
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,463
WORLD.

1027
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:20,263
THE THING THAT IS INTERESTING

1028
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:26,036
ABOUT XIAOMI AND HUAWEI IS

1029
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,504
THEY ARE MAKING HIGH-END PHONES

1030
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,171
FOR NOT HIGH-END PRICES.

1031
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:36,012
KIND OF AN $800 TOPLINE PRICE WE

1032
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:36,847
HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM SAMSUNG

1033
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:37,347
AND THE IPHONE.

1034
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:43,386
RAMY: WITH XIAOMI, HUGO BARRA

1035
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:44,121
WAS ON BLOOMBERG RECENTLY

1036
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,155
TALKING ABOUT THEIR STRONG

1037
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,824
INTENT TO GET INTO PLAY.

1038
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:48,658
I WANT TO GET INTO A LITTLE OF

1039
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:49,025
THAT.

1040
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:52,062
>> WE WILL LEAD WITH CHANNELS

1041
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,330
THAT ALLOW US TO GET IN TOUCH

1042
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,931
WITH A YOUNG GENERATION THAT IS

1043
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,534
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TECHNOLOGY.

1044
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,436
DEFINITELY GOING TO MAKE OUR WAY

1045
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,904
THERE.

1046
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:13,950
RAMY: DO YOU THINK XIAOMI WILL

1047
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:14,551
BE ABLE TO BREAK IN?

1048
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,620
>> HUAWEI WILL HAVE A BETTER

1049
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,020
CHANCE.

1050
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,754
THEY HAVE INCREDIBLE EXPERTISE

1051
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:18,488
IN TELECOM AND CHIPS WHICH HAS

1052
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:19,256
ALLOWED THEM PRICING ADVANTAGE

1053
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,525
WHICH XIAOMI DOES NOT HAVE.

1054
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:26,029
IF ANYONE CAN MAKE INROADS, IT

1055
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:26,730
MIGHT BE THEM IN TERMS OF

1056
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,364
CHINESE HANDSET MAKERS.

1057
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,131
RAMY: PETER, I WANT TO BRING YOU

1058
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:28,765
IN.

1059
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,500
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT IS

1060
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,334
HAPPENING WITH CHINESE AND U.S.

1061
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:32,102
SMARTPHONE MAKERS IN TERMS OF

1062
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,336
THEM TRYING TO GET IN THERE?

1063
00:49:33,336 --> 00:49:38,308
>> I THINK THE CHINESE

1064
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,075
SMARTPHONE MAKERS ARE GOING TO

1065
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:41,244
HAVE A HARD TIME IN THE U.S.

1066
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,112
MARKET FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

1067
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,881
REASONS.

1068
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,883
I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED

1069
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,485
TO THINK ABOUT WHICH OF THESE

1070
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,086
COMPANIES IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

1071
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:50,921
AGGRESSIVELY MOVING TO THE U.S.

1072
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,957
XIAOMI IS USING A BUSINESS MODEL

1073
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:57,160
THAT HAS HISTORICALLY NOT WORKED

1074
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,433
IN THE U.S.

1075
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,167
THEY ARE TRYING TO BYPASS

1076
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:04,901
CARRIERS WITHOUT SUBSIDIES.

1077
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:05,669
U.S. CONSUMERS LIKE TO GET THAT

1078
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,436
SUBSIDY WHEN THEY SIGN UP FOR A

1079
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:06,836
CONTRACT.

1080
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:08,371
SELLING TO THEM DIRECTLY ONLINE

1081
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:09,105
HAS BEEN TRIED IN THE PAST AND

1082
00:50:09,105 --> 00:50:09,606
IT NEVER WORKS.

1083
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:14,010
IN TERMS OF HUAWEI, THEY HAVE

1084
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,446
SOME TECHNOLOGY ADVANTAGES.

1085
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,247
THEY JUMPED TO THE TOP OF THE

1086
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:17,948
CHINESE SMARTPHONE MARKET

1087
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:21,451
SERIOUS -- QUICKLY.

1088
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,219
BUT THE NAME SETS OFF ALARM

1089
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,054
BELLS IN THE U.S. FOR A VARIETY

1090
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:27,257
OF REASONS, NOT ALL OF THEM

1091
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:29,493
NECESSARILY WELL-FOUNDED.

1092
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,360
U.S. CARRIERS ARE NOT GOING TO

1093
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,997
SUPPORT HUAWEI COMING TO THE

1094
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,699
U.S. AND A BIG WAY AND GIVE THEM

1095
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,433
THE SUBSIDIES TO TAKE MARKET

1096
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:36,800
SHARE.

1097
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,535
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER

1098
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,706
PLAYERS IN CHINA, THOSE

1099
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,540
COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE AMBITIONS

1100
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,675
TO MOVE INTO THE U.S. MARKET.

1101
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,443
HAVING SAID THAT, THE U.S.

1102
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,511
MARKET IS TUMULTUOUS.

1103
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,379
YOU HAVE SEEN TONS OF CHANGE.

1104
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,316
APPLE AND SAMSUNG'S DOMINANCE IS

1105
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:53,917
A BIT OF AN ANOMALY.

1106
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,354
RAMY: I WANT TO GET YOUR

1107
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,955
THOUGHTS ON CRITICISMS ABOUT

1108
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,490
XIAOMI.

1109
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,392
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT IS

1110
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,495
AN ALL-OUT COPYCAT OF APPLE.

1111
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,131
DO YOU THINK THIS HAS ANY LEGS

1112
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:08,531
TO IT?

1113
00:51:08,531 --> 00:51:16,373
>> HISTORICALLY, XIAOMI HAD I.P.

1114
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,140
PROBLEMS GETTING STARTED IN

1115
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:17,607
CHINA.

1116
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:21,278
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE I.P. OTHER

1117
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:21,811
COMPANIES HAD.

1118
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:24,848
THAT HAS CHANGED.

1119
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:25,649
THEY WENT TO MICROSOFT, WHICH

1120
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,518
BOUGHT THE NOKIA SMARTPHONE

1121
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,720
BUSINESS, AND THEY BOUGHT A TON

1122
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,655
OF PATENTS FROM THEM.

1123
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,123
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DEFEND

1124
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,691
THAT.

1125
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,593
AT INDUSTRY GATHERINGS, YOU NEED

1126
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,163
I.P. TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.

1127
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:40,930
THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS A

1128
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,298
PROBLEM.

1129
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,934
RAMY: ANY THOUGHTS OF THREATS OF

1130
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:45,735

1134
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,578

THANKS TO POKEMON GO.

1150

THEY RECORDED MORE ACTIVE U.S.

00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,984
USERS IN JULY THAN SNAPCHAT,

1152
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:54,424
TWITTER, OR PINTREST.

1153
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:55,191
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER

1154
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,026
POKEMON GO CAN KEEP THESE USERS

1155
00:54:57,026 --> 00:54:58,228
ENGAGED LONG-TERM.

1156
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:03,600
DATA SHOWS A DECLINE IN

1157
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,167
ENGAGEMENT.

1158
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,001
DAILY USERS HAVE BEEN IN A SLOW

1159
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,802
DECLINE SINCE THEY PEAKED IN MID

1160
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,169
JULY.

1161
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:06,936
ANOTHER STORY WE ARE WATCHING.

1162
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:12,141
KOBE BRYANT IS THE WINNER OF

1163
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:14,711
FIVE NBA CHAMPIONSHIPS.

1164
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:15,545
HE IS ADDING SOMETHING ELSE TO

1165
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,179
HIS RESUME -- VENTURE

1166
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:16,613
CAPITALISTS.

1167
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:21,150
BRYANT HAS LAUNCHED A FUND

1168
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:31,360
CALLED BRYANT-STEVELE.

1169
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,597
THEY TEAM UP TO CREATE A LOS

1170
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:35,365
ANGELES-BASED FUND THAT WILL

1171
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:42,238
FOCUS ON TECH, MEDIA, AND DATA

1172
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:42,739
COMPANIES.

1173
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,406
WE WILL SEE IF HE IS AS

1174
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:47,310

1175
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:47,944

INSTAGRAM.

1179
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:54,450
THE APP HAS JOINED THE ONE

BILLION DOWNLOAD CLUB ON GOOGLE

00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,486
PLAY.

1182
00:55:56,486 --> 00:56:02,058
ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND, THE

1183
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:02,825
DOWNLOAD COUNTER DOES NOT

1184
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:03,626
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN UNIQUE

1185
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,595
INSTALLATIONS, MEANING ONE USER

1186
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:06,296
COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

1187
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:06,863
MULTIPLE DOWNLOADS.

1188
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:11,501

1217
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:30,553
[APPLAUSE]

1218
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:34,690

ONE DAY I WILL CUT BANGS AND

[LAUGHTER]

1226
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:54,210
I'M THE SAME PERSON.

[LAUGHTER]

1233
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:05,988

01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,801
WANTED TO BE.

1240
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:19,635
I'M TALKING TO THE GUYS RIGHT

1241
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:23,272

EVERYONE IS HOT THERE.

1246
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,815
EVERYBODY.

1247
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:37,853
I SAW A GUY CLEANING UP A PIZZA

1248
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:38,621
HUT BATHROOM THAT I WOULD HAVE

1249
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:42,158
PAID THIS GUY TO -- ME.

1250
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,926
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN SEE ME THERE.

1251
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:47,029
IS THAT A FAT TUMBLEWEED?

1252
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:52,768
MY BODY TYPE THERE -- MY ARMS

1253
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:56,405
REGISTER AS LEGS THERE.

1254
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:57,039
IS THAT AN OCTOPUS?

1255
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1256
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,109
AND MY LEGS ARE USED FOR

1257
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,112
FIREWOOD.

1258
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:07,416
[LAUGHTER]

1259
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,317
AND THAT'S THE SECRET, I FOUND

1260
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:08,651
OUT.

1261
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:13,556
THAT'S HOLLYWOOD'S SECRET.

1262
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,390
THEY DON'T PUT FOOD IN THEIR

1263
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,324
FACES.

1264
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:18,594
AND THAT'S NOT AN OPTION FOR ME.

1265
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:19,528
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS IN YOUR

1266
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:20,096
HOUSE GROWING UP.

1267
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,032
YOU WOULD EAT UNTIL YOU WERE IN

1268
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:26,469
A LOT OF PAIN.

1269
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,304
THEN YOU TAKE LIKE A LITTLE

1270
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,340
BREATHER AND YOU GET YOURSELF

1271
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:39,748
BACK AND EVEN MORE PAIN.

1272
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:40,449
I WAS BORN WEIGHING 150.

1273
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,350
I CAME OUT SWINGING.

1274
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:48,758
GIVE ME PIZZA!

1275
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:49,659
[APPLAUSE]

1276
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,493
THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN.

1277
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:58,567
I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE -- I'VE

1278
01:03:58,567 --> 01:03:59,301
NEVER SAID THIS SENTENCE.

1279
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:00,036
I FORGOT TO HAVE LUNCH TODAY.

1280
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,537
[LAUGHTER]

1281
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,407
IF ANYTHING, I WOULD BE LIKE I

1282
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,475
HAD TWO LEDGES TODAY.

1283
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:11,113

THE SHOW IS SLATED FOR A FIFTH

1287
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:17,620
SEASON, BUT NOT IN THE

1288
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,989

AMY: YOU ARE NOT NOTHING,

01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:40,676
YOU ARE NOT OVERWEIGHT.

1294
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:41,042
OK.

1295
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:41,777
HOW DOES A WOMAN WHO DOES NOT

KNOW HOW TO LEARN TO SEW GO ON.

1297
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:44,780
AND IF SO, WHAT COULD HER NAME

1298
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,649
BE?

1299
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:58,093
I KNOW, HER NAME BE LIKE -- OH!

1300
01:04:58,093 --> 01:05:01,097
THAT FLAG THAT WILL WAVE JUST

1301
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:07,670
LIKE THIS.

1302
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:08,471
TRYING TO PROVE A BETTER STATE

1303
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:08,904
EXISTS.

1304
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:11,107
THAT'S THE NEXT ONE.

1305
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:16,112
>> THAT IS ACT I?

1306
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,279
>> AS I JUST SAID, THAT IS ACT

1307
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:17,580

1308
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,250
ASKED TO IS LIKE MORE

1309
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:21,717
POP-CULTURE.

1310
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:23,286
I'M SO FANCY.

1311
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:24,086
I'D BETTER HAVE MY STAR.

1312
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,790
IT'S A GETTING FLAG IN HERE SO

CHARLIE: LAST YEAR, SHE WROTE

01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:47,076
AND STARRED IN HER FIRST FILM

1316
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:47,710
CALLED "TRAIN WRECK."

1317
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:48,444
THAT FILM MADE MORE THAN $140

1318
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,446
MILLION WORLDWIDE.

1319
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,617
>> THIS IS MORE COMFORTABLE.

1320
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,484
>> I WILL TELL YOU IF I CAN FEEL

1321
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:56,252

FIRST BOOK CALLED "THE GIRL WITH

1324
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,700
THE LOWER BACK TATTOO."

1325
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,568
THE BOOK IS LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY

1326
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:13,335
WHEN SHE WANTED TO BE, BUT MORE

1327
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:14,103
OFTEN IS SURPRISINGLY HONEST AND

1328
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:14,403
RAW.

1329
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,305

MEMBER OF NEW MONEY TO WHAT SHE

1332
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,376
WANTS PEOPLE TO SAY AT HER

1333
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:25,214
FUNERAL.

LIKE HER COMEDY IN HER LIFE, THE

1335
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,483
BOOK RECEIVES HIGH PRAISE.

1336
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:35,191
ALL OF THAT MAKES ME VERY

1337
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:35,991
PLEASED TO HAVE AMY SCHUMER AT

1338

WAIT.

1345
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,398
CHARLIE: DID YOU REALLY?

1346
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:46,669
WHY NOW, TO WRITE THIS BOOK?

1347
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,437
IT IS REALLY REVEALING.

1348
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:54,143
AMY: I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR

1349
01:06:54,143 --> 01:07:01,417
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS, ACTUALLY.
