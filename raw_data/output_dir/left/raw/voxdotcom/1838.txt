00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,040
There are a lot of ways to take a picture
of yourself.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,960
But if you look carefully, something's not
quite right about your close-ups.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,860
Selfies can make our faces look weird and
it's changing the way we see ourselves, and

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,280
the decisions we make about our facial features.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,890
A lot of people think their nose looks big
in selfies and it's driving them to get nosejobs.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,900
A 2017 poll found that 55% of facial plastic
surgeons saw patients who wanted surgeries

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,110
to make them look better in selfies.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,860
That was an increase of 13% from 2016.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,640
But those complaints are often due to a distortion
created by the distance between a camera

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,750
and a subject.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,620
This is what a portrait looks like from five
feet away.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,210
And this is what it looks like from one foot
away, about the distance that most people

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,870
are taking selfies.

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,190
That's a huge difference in facial structures,
especially the nose.

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,170
A team of researchers found that taking a
photo from one foot away, makes the base of

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,080
the nose look about 30% larger

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,040
and the tip look 7% larger, than they would from a further distance.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,980
From five feet away, your features are flattened.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,120
From a foot, your nose is exaggerated.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,440
So the parts of your face that are close to
the camera,

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,000
look bigger than they actually are.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,880
It's as if the nose is in the foreground and
the ears are in the background, instead of

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,690
being on the same plane.

24
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,500
For now, long arms and selfie sticks are your
best bet.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,610
But phone camera software might one day be
able to alter images with a treatment that

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,180
simulates the effect of a distant camera.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,300
Researchers at Princeton created a tool that
can manipulate the position and distance between

28
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,130
a camera and the subject, after the photo
was taken.

29
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,460
So a close-up selfie like this, can be made
to look like it's taken at a more flattering,

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,770
natural distance.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,600
It's not perfect, but a version of this technology

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,760
could help design the right tool for a forward-facing camera,

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,120
one that will make our selfies

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:00:00,000
feel more like us.
