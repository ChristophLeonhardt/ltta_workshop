following the weekend bombing raids in Syria a bipartisan group of US senators has unveiled new legislation aiming to limit the White House's power to continue its global war on terror for too long Congress has given presidents a blank check to wage war we've let the 9/11 and Iraq war authorizations get stretched to justify wars against multiple terrorist groups in over a dozen countries from Nigeria to the Philippines our proposal finally repeals those authorizations and makes Congress do its job by weighing in on where when and with who we are at war the proposed the legislation would require the president to give Congress 48 hours notice ahead of any new military action Congress would then have 60 days to review that move it doesn't set a limit for any military action however it does include a congressional review every four years the proposal also expands the President's authority to take action against al Qaeda Isis or the Taliban but not a state now the current War Powers have been in place since 9/11 and have been used nearly 40 times in 14 countries we discussed the proposed overhaul with former US congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul it more or less is defining things slightly differently but it wouldn't slow up I think the effort to go to war I don't think it really repeals the War Powers Resolution but it does say that Congress gives the president the authority to go to war against radical violent groups like al Qaeda and Isis and maybe Taliban but they say not a country I really don't think it's going to pass we'll see I only welcome the debate but I think they'll wake up and find out it's not doing anything and that when they pass these resolutions most of the time things get worse this whole idea that you can fight radicals anyplace in the world that's what they're doing a radius just gives more authority to the type of policy that we've been following and getting us into trouble
