future of a makeshift migrant camp in a park in the French city of Nantes in question some four to five hundred people have pitched up there with sanitary conditions now so bad that doctors are warning of an impending epidemic the local prefecture ordered the park to be evacuated but the city's mayor refused to comply saying instead she would just offered the migrants basic aid well the matter has since gone to court which are sided with the prefecture but it's still unclear where the migrants will be resettled the camp began forming a couple of months ago when the first tents were erected mashaallah dubitzky visited the place in Nantes in a public garden in the heart of the city hundreds of refugees stand in line for their next meal one of them we will be calling him Mohammed has been in the city for two months he's agreed to speak to us as long as we hide his identity we're lost hopeless there are problems with finding somewhere to live on food we don't sleep well it's very tiresome it's painful very painful because there is a risk of epidemics here not at all happy because we are in danger here and sanitation is a big issue it's estimated that around 500 people live in this camp yet there's only one toilet and just a single water tap they've been here for weeks after being expelled from an abandoned building nearby and a problem that was once being masked Anant is now in full view and locals are getting increasingly worried it's very negative for nuns just like it's negative for any other city where they settled regardless of whether it's Paris or any other city it's a very bad sign for the locals and for tourists I think we need to evacuate them from but don't move them outside of the scene it's not good for now we try to have a clean City but today the hygiene conditions are not being respected they don't have access to sanitation there's only one water tap this park is not adapted to house migrants despite calls to clear the camp the local mayor had refused saying the reception migrants should be dignified and organized but so far it's anything but the camp has been deemed an eyesore and a major sanitation issue by many locals and it's also a big worry for humanitarian groups there is a problem with Town Hall that doesn't want to take responsibility for the emergency and it's a humanitarian emergency here they are not economic migrants they are political migrants ninety-five percent now the authorities have taken the decision to expel migrants from this camp and as they pack up their few belongings they're not sure where they're going to head to next but it will be somewhere and they're likely to stay together as a group so the problem rather than being solved is just being moved despite promises by the local authority to solve this situation with emergency accommodation so far it just looks like they're losing control charlotte dibinsky RT not you
