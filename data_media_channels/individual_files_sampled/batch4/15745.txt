now there's been so much talk regarding the withering craft of journalism I think one big difference is that while mainstream newspapers have always held bias viewpoints those viewpoints used to be confined to the op-ed pages what we're seeing these days is the biases moved from the front page or rather the op-ed pages to the front page where it poses as actual news what's your take on this what I consider to be as our a most disturbing development I think that the biggest biases the mainstream media have actually been a little bit different I think it's what they choose to talk about at all what they choose to ignore at all and the voices they interview as experts or guests versus those that they unperson and pretend don't exist so I think that the advent of citizen journalism of Twitter YouTube Facebook things like the rebel is that the cartel has been broken open a little bit so I mean I think that I use the word media party and and I use it so often I should stop every once in a while explain what I mean it's a group of people who act like a political party and then they have similar interests similar backgrounds similar outlook on life they have a similar there's sometimes whip each other into party discipline but more than that they they're culturally the same they go to the same schools the same clubs their kids go to the same schools they date each other marry each other it's so incestuous and nepotistic so it's a media party like a political party and it's a media party like a socialite party so there's a lot of class and geographic barriers so so many people in the media business which is really headquartered in Toronto a little bit in Ottawa in Montreal so it shuts out anyone who doesn't come from that cookie cutter background from that cookie cutter point of view who didn't take a liberal arts degree at McGill or Queens or U of T I mean it's so think alike and when you look at how many journalists their spouse is in a political party or the spouse as a journalist it's so interwoven I yes having opinions on the front page mass in news that is a problem but the larger problems to me are the issues that are utterly ignored by the mainstream media we know what those are Islam is a big one of them yeah and the the total classism those are the two big problems hey that was an excerpt from my weekly show rebel roundup in which we highlight the best stories of the week with your favorite rebels if you want to see the full show please sign up to become a Premium Member you
