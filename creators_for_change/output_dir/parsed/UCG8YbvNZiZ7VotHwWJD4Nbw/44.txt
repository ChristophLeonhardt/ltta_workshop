hey guys I am starting off my day at the
pocket life studios here in the
Philippines and I'm going to be
transforming my face from this to this
yes that's right you guys I have a
magical face that can just turn just
like that alright anyways the next stop
I'm gonna be heading over to my patio
because I have a hosting gig there
tonight so I just don't hit the right
art so I'm gonna head over there
my exercise
I have a long walk ahead of me but I
have a lot of time so I'm just gonna
take it easy you know just chill out a
bit I just remembered that I'm looking
for frosted glasses so I'm gonna take a
little detour here and
Abbot's fingers crossed everything up
they have it because I've been to so
many places to look for this I'm hoping
that this is it
there are I really have a good feeling
about this place I went through all of
the shelves and I even asked some sales
maybe if they had but I'm just looking
for and they don't go outside you guys I
don't even know where I'm gonna find
this I'm so close to this giving up
because it seems like none of the places
I've got to have this maybe they don't
make it the Philippines No
Lambert did have the most variety of
shot glasses they just didn't have the
frosted ones which is the one I'm
absolutely looking for
yes that's that
and yeah I'm just gonna chill here for
about two hours
I wanna order
I've never tried
and the service
it looks like
this one here this is my favorite and so
I'm super excited but I like
I'm gonna try the onion rings
it's afternoon super um you
that solutions which despitefully and 13
of the same time and then the sauce is
kind of lemony to just imagine they I
see a Lebanese all together and it's
awesome crunchy it's my first time
trying this and I feel like now it's
time to try also dude really reminds me
of a product when you're I've tried no
other reps
oh there's so much flavor I mean who
knew that of brilliance after sort of
good in June food this is very peanuts
and I'm sure like this but it does look
good pink
I like it it's late Lebanese and married

gig so now I'm gonna head home
