1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,233
“Set the controls for the heart of the sun.”

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,933
In the summer of 2018,

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:12,500
the Parker Solar Probe
will lift off from Earth.

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,100
It will spend the next seven years

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,233
spiraling inward to
the center of the solar system.

6
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,700
The Parker probe will be
the first spacecraft

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,300
to touch our star. Or any star.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,066
It will brush through the halo of hot gases

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,666
that form the sun’s outer atmosphere:

10
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:32,333
the corona.

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,966
The surface of the sun
looks placid to our eyes,

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,366
but it is pierced and roiled
by strong magnetic fields.

13
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,400
The fields trap gas blowing off the Sun

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,800
and lift it into glowing
arcs and streamers.

15
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:52,633
Scientists don’t understand
how the corona works,

16
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,466
or why it’s hundreds of times hotter

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
than the surface of the sun.

18
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,200
The Parker probe will
pass closer to the Sun

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,933
than any mission before it.

20
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,933
To get that close,
the spacecraft will make

21
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,566
seven flybys of Venus over seven years,

22
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,966
gradually tightening its elliptical orbit

23
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,766
and shifting it closer
and closer to the sun.

24
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:20,060
A high-tech heat shield

25
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,430
will protect the probe from the punishing

26
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:25,366
radiation and heat of the corona.

27
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,100
Within the shield’s shadow,

28
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:30,860
the spacecraft instruments will operate

29
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,966
at a comfortable room temperature.

30
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:36,200
As the probe passes close to the sun,

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,600
it will briefly become the fastest machine

32
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,366
ever built by humans,

33
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:45,266
zipping along at a brisk
430,000 miles per hour.

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,600
The Parker probe is
the first NASA spacecraft

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
to be named after a living person.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,300
Eugene Parker is an astrophysicist

37
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,300
at the University of Chicago.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,930
In 1958, he suggested
that the sun radiates

39
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,366
a constant and intense
stream of charged particles.

40
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,966
He called it the solar wind.

41
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,764
This wind pushes out comet tails

42
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:14,666
and makes the long streamers
seen in solar eclipses.

43
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,433
With the Parker Solar Probe,

44
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:21,233
scientists hope to learn more
about the sun’s turbulent corona.

45
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,666
How it accelerates particles,

46
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:26,800
and how it flings huge clouds of fiery gas

47
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,366
outward across space.

48
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,900
Huge waves of magnetized gas

49
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,266
are called coronal mass ejections.

50
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,100
If Earth gets in the way
of one of these storms,

51
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,966
it could be bad news.

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,766
Our planet is protected
by its own magnetic field,

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
but a direct hit from
one of these galloping clouds

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,600
of particles and radiation
could disrupt satellites

55
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:53,000
and force astronauts in
the space station to take shelter.

56
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,466
In 1859,

57
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,400
a powerful storm
called the Carrington Event

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,133
produced auroras as far south as Cuba.

59
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,933
A solar storm of that size today

60
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,266
could cripple satellites and power grids

61
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,600
around the world.

62
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,533
If successful, the Parker probe’s

63
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,266
mission to touch the sun

64
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,033
may explain how solar storms form.

65
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,866
Scientists hope it might teach us how

66
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,400
to predict coronal outbursts
more accurately

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,700
and learn how to endure them.

68
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:27,766
We’ve always depended
on the kindness of a star,

69
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,133
here on a planet riding the gentle fringe

70
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,500
of barely calculable forces.

71
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,833
Living with a star is not easy.

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:00:00,000
But we’re learning.
