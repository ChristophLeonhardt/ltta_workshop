concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of winning if the president now</font>

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,810
finds himself humiliated by the

162
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,820
conservative leadership unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

163
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,710
with Republicans on the hill many

164
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,450
conservatives may find they have paved

165
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,880
the way toward and essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> left-wing</font>

166

presidency I feel this may be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,380
can find more love on the left and on

the right more<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance of winning through</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">factions in House Republican Conference</font>

178
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,960
and Trump is also tweeting against the

179
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
freedom caucus but conservatives who

180
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,850
basically shot down the bill so I know

181
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,680
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying how does Cleveland do</font>

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,590
that the physics it was like a property

183
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,990
like you know he's like that kid in in

184
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,460
the sixth sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> who sees dead people</font>

185
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,410
except he just looks into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future and</font>

186
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,729
sees things that aren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen</font>

187
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,289
so reason the reason is is that I'm just

188
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">a practical realist night my attitude is</font>

189
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,060
different my attitude is admittedly

190
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,830
different to those who want to live and

191
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,240
die<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the hill of principle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

192
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,760
hill of righteousness I love my country

193
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,250
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do the best thing for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

194
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,650
country at any given moment that's what

195
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,139
love looks like me sometimes love tastes

196
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,910
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crap sandwich okay you could have</font>

197
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,620
make a little mug that says that

198
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,570
sometimes love tastes<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a crab salmon</font>

199
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,270
I didn't love voting for Donald Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

200
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,770
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not love voting for Donald Trump</font>

201
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were exactly two choices one was</font>

202
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,870
Hillary Clinton who I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

203
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,810
was wicked and would mark the end of the

204
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">American experiment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one was Donald Trump</font>

205
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,820
who is an unreliable if you're a

206
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,050
conservative right some people aren't

207
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,640
conservative and like Trump they their

208
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,140
populace they want to they want to keep

209
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,760
all the entitlements and all that stuff

210
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,409
great then he's a perfect candidate for

211
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:57,020
me the guy is to the left of<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and he's</font>

212
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,550
not a reliable conservative lifelong

213
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,890
Democrat so how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> then deal with it</font>

214
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,050
for a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

215
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,000
Trump goes where he's loved because all

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,080
this love was coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

217
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,849
conservative side for a moment we had a

218
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,169
chance to get that agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and it</font>

219
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:13,640
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if chance is not totally</font>

220
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,250
destroyed but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this first big</font>

221
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,470
thing the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> big thing that he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

222
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,150
his legislative accomplishment you don't

223
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,440
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give him everything he wants all</font>

224
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,870
day long for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of his term but on</font>

225
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,340
the first big thing I would have given

226
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">him a win I would not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have stood on my</font>

227
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:28,729
righteousness I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have given him the</font>

228
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:30,620
win and hope the Senate made it into a

229
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,179
better bill it wasn't a great bill it

230
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,799
was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great bill everybody knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

231
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,900
wasn't but look so let's take a look

232
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,849
here's Trump right in the aftermath and

233
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">he puts it on the Democrats that were</font>

234
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,099
stuck with Obamacare which is what he's

235
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,000
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell yeah we were very close</font>

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,640
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very tight margin we have no</font>

237
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Democrats</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support we had no votes from</font>

238
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,959
the Democrats and if they weren't going

239
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give us a single vote so it's a very</font>

240
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult thing to do I've been saying</font>

241
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,459
for the last year and a half that the

242
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,930
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we can do politically</font>

243
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,800
speaking is let Obamacare explode it is

244
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploding right now it's many states</font>

245
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
have big problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost all states have</font>

246
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,380
big problems I was in Tennessee the

247
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,120
other day and they've lost half of their

248
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,459
state in terms of an insurer have no

249
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,610
insurance and that's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

250
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,430
many other places i was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kentucky the</font>

251
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,890
other day and similar things are

252
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,890
happening so Obamacare is exploding with

253
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,680
no democrat support we couldn't quite

254
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,870
get there were just a very small number

255
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those shorts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of getting our</font>

256
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,779
bill had a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't realize</font>

257
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,970
how good our bill was because they were

258
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">viewing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phase one but when you add phase</font>

259
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,399
two which was mostly designing for

260
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">secretary price who's behind them and</font>

261
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,260
you add phase three which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we</font>

262
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,850
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have gotten it became the great</font>

263
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,910
film see I agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

264
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,649
gotten phase two because obviously that

265
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,480
was stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to depend on a</font>

266
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,850
phone and not even a phone actually but

267
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think they would have ever</font>

268
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,540
gotten to stage three now so first he

269
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,519
slaps the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrats around I first he</font>

270
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,899
says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you stuck us with this</font>

271
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,579
bill all your fault we wouldn't help us

272
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,680
change it and then he reaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

273
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,899
room here's the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> code again I</font>

274
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,140
think what will happen is Obamacare

275
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,209
unfortunately will explode could have a

276
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,630
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad year last year you had over a</font>

277
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,750
hundred percent increases in various

278
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,529
places in Arizona understand it going up

279
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,779
very rapidly again like it did last year

280
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:38,980
lesser was 116 / said many places fifty

281
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,810
sixty seventy percent i guess it

282
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,449
averaged whatever the average was very

283
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:46,089
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard and this year should be much</font>

284
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:48,220
worse for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Obamacare so what would be</font>

285
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good with no democrat support if</font>

286
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,529
the democrats when it explodes which it

287
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,079
will soon if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> got together with us</font>

288
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,920
and get a real health<font color="#CCCCCC"> care so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd be</font>

289
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,540
totally open to it and i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

290
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,990
going to happen i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the losers are</font>

291
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,269
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer because

292
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,640
now they own Obamacare they own it<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100</font>

293
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent donuts so basically he's trying</font>

294
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,070
to scare the one thing by the way the

295
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,680
good news here is it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

296
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,209
freedom caucus was going to stand on

297
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,769
their principles the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrats are too</font>

298
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:23,860
stupid to you know to respond to this I

299
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,560
mean Chuck Schumer has built his his

300
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,420
fortress he's not coming around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

301
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he's there's anything there there</font>

302
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,110
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Trump is bacon Trump knows it I</font>

303
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,300
think he's basically scaring trying to

304
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,320
scare the

305
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,120
conservative straight basically trying

306
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say you work with me you're gonna</font>

307
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to work with me or else I reach out</font>

308
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,040
to the Democrats which I'm not sure it's

309
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,930
an actual possibility all right so who's

310
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,970
to blame I ain't blame to go around I

311
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,410
think there's blame to go around I mean

312
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,620
first of all I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump didn't care</font>

313
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,650
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and he pushed Ryan to just</font>

get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> done because he wants to</font>

315
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to tax reform and by the way this is</font>

316
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">another problem with this miss bill did</font>

317
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,890
cut 1.2 trillion dollars in government

318
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,830
spending which makes tax reform a doddle

319
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,420
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I then you then you can do</font>

320
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,640
tax reform any way you want right

321
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,530
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this money that's</font>

322
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,910
not being spent so that's all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

323
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,230
that you can take out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tax system</font>

324
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,840
until maybe the tax cuts<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause there to</font>

325
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,150
be more money coming in now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

326
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,010
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feeling ceilings and now you</font>

327
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the guys like Paul Ryan they want a</font>

328
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,890
neutral tax cut in income neutral tax

329
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,660
cut makes it a lot harder to do it's a

330
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,830
lot harder to find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of money</font>

331
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">just lying around in the sofa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

332
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,900
Washington<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one thing so come push</font>

333
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,330
cryin Ryan move too quickly I mean there

334
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,060
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just no question that Ryan moved too</font>

335
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,920
quickly but basically he did this in

336
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,540
secret he didn't bring everybody

337
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,640
together he didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the consensus</font>

338
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,050
first that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have taken too much</font>

339
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,180
time he's let Trump Russian after all

340
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,860
it's Ryan's you know one of the things

341
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm I'm an actual fan of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan</font>

342
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,760
but I think he screwed the pooch I mean

343
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,500
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's basically it I think Ryan</font>

344
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,360
did screw the pooch on this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

345
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,540
that he he basically thought that the

346
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,700
Trump would bring the guys around he

347
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,470
thought Trump would do is his deal

348
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,240
making thing I don't think Trump cared

349
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,960
enough to do it and and he just didn't

350
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,160
get the consensus he needed because it

351
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,510
would have taken too<font color="#CCCCCC"> long it would have</font>

352
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,770
taken too long<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get everybody together</font>

353
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,360
so that was that was well here's why and

354
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,220
afterwards he just looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

355
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's been hit by a bowling ball I will</font>

356
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,260
not sugarcoat this this is a

357
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,020
disappointing day for us doing big

358
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,770
things is hard all of us all of us

359
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,200
myself included we will need time to

360
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,340
reflect on how we got to this moment

361
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,940
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have done to do it better</font>

362
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,890
but ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all kind of comes</font>

363
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">down to a choice are all of us willing</font>

364
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give a little to get something done</font>

365
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,120
are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to say yes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the good to</font>

366
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the very good even if it's not the</font>

367
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">perfect</font>

368
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,790
because if we're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that we</font>

369
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,960
still have such an incredible

370
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity in front of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us there remains</font>

371
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,410
so much that we can do to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve</font>

372
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,230
people's lives and we will because

373
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,460
that's I got to tell you that's why I'm

374
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,710
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know which way every member</font>

375
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,120
of this conference is here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font>

376
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,970
a better country we want American

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,950
families to feel more confident in their

378
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,440
lot in life we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next generation</font>

country are still ahead of us I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

381
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,650
proud of the bill that we produce it

382
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,050
would make a dramatic improvement in our

383
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care system and provide relief by</font>

384
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,000
people hurting under Obamacare and

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
what's probably most troubling is the

386
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,740
worst is yet to come with Obamacare you

387
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,110
know one kind word for Ryan I always

388
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,670
feel her you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Conservatives</font>

389
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,900

390
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,040
they hate to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the house because</font>

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">he's wrangling cats you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you forget</font>

392
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,180
that a lot of the people in the house

393
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,270
are moderates you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

center-right country right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

395
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,420

the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

with the freedom caucus for conserving

399
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,080
he was losing the moderates he was

his on his behalf that he was dealing

408
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,490
with a president who promised everyone

409
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,840
would be covered right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

intransigent freedom caucus who I do

414
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,380
