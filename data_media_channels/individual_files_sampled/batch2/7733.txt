an update on the Kansas man who was wrongfully imprisoned for 23 years his name is Lamont McIntyre and he was in prison for 23 years he was recently in October exonerated on double murder charges he sat down with CBS and two things kind of really came to light about this one just the facts of his trial which at his trial in 1994 when he was 17 there was no physical evidence or motive presented worse and this is kind of what is crystallizing now according to McIntyre's current lawyers lead police detective Roger globe ski built the case by threatening witnesses there are about a dozen people behind bars whose cases are connected to detective galovski and a senior member of the Kentucky Bureau of Investigation announced that he is going to look into those past behaviors and was launching a more formal inquiry so that's one part about it and the idea that there are multiple people who are still sitting behind bars who might be suffering the exact same fate that Lamont suffered for 23 years the other aspect of it is that he lives in Kansas and Kansas is one of the few states in America that does not compensate you if it is found that you were wrongfully imprisoned according to the innocent project Innocence Project the federal government the District of Columbia and 32 states have compensation statutes of some form the following 18 states do not and then they list them Alaska Arizona you can see if your state falls into that category below but that is about it's almost one that's almost 20% of the state's actually so it's not that small of a number no wait that's 40 percent almost geez that's a lot of states yeah so he was in prison for a longer than he was out of prison so he put him in prison in seven when he was 17 he serves 23 years now he's 41 finally gets out first let's just rewind and talk about how miserable the case against that one was it's and you see this stuff and it is amazing that people get life sentence sometimes I give the death penalty on the flimsiest evidence he got two life sentences for so somebody went killed two guys that were sitting in a car okay so why'd they think it was Lamont McIntyre well they have one witness that said III think it's a guy from the with the name Lamont okay so and they're like and she points this Lamont McIntyre okay well you say alright that's something right and then they get a second witness to back up the first witness who it turns out later said no galovski made me say that he threatened me and forced me to say it it isn't him it isn't him I made it up and they're like yeah whatever go ahead and stay in prison for two decades anyway okay in the trial as Brett pointed out no gun no motive no physical evidence turns out Lamont magnetar doesn't even know these guys and they presented no evidence that he knows these guys so without knowing these guys he just up and shot them for no reason at all and one of the witnesses we know made up the story so-called witnesses and then yeah there was the police at the time could not present any evidence in the trial that they even bothered to look for evidence that they bothered to look for the gun or motive or physical evidence of any sort on this they gave him two life sentences it's it's amazing what happens in the 79 he's a 17-year old and he was seventeen year old and of course they waited till he was 18 and try him as an adult so they can give him life sentences so and it another amazing part of the story is one of the guys who was shot was around the same age as Lamont was I was a young guy right and his mom joined Lamont's mom in fighting for Lamont's innocence and to get him out for these last 20 years from the beginning she's like it's not him it's definitely not him why are we putting him in prison that doesn't help my son that doesn't help justice she refused to even go see her son's biryeo place until she got justice for Lamont McIntyre which is amazing which leads me to my other point when you do gross injustice is like this you never get the actual guy you never get the person who acts the killings who I would like to bring to justice and it's out of laziness and corruption and all this stuff so which then leads to why did they this took eight years and and they've wonderful people wonderful work on it the Innocence Project yeah yeah and and a lot and a couple of different groups worked on this and and so why in the middle of the hearing back in October did the prosecutor come and go never mind he's free to go we changed our minds I'll tell you why okay so one of the charges was as they were relitigated this basically to try to get him off was that not only did the cop do something wrong but that prosecutor Tara Morehead who's now a prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office in Kansas had also done something wrong and one of the things she did wrong was that she did not reveal what apparently was a romantic relationship with the judge in the case and the judge in that case was J Dexter Burdette who was scheduled to testify because he was forced to in this case and before he was going to come out and testify the prosecutor is like oh never mind never mind you're free to go okay off you go our bad sorry did we keep you in prison for 23 years didn't mean to do that in other words the judge was going to get embarrassed and never disclosed the relationship he had with the prosecutor and hence did not treat Lamont McIntyre fairly and and so and by the way I would like to have justice on that as well and then on top of everything else they're like no sorry not gonna give you a goddamn thing we robbed you of your life and did it in the most grotesquely unfair way who cares you get nothing to put in perspective the compensation that's kind of a standard statutes according to the Innocence Project should include either a fixed sum or a range of recovery for each year spent in prison President George W Bush actually endorsed Congress's recommended amount of up to $50,000 per year with an additional $50,000 for each year spent on death row adjusted for inflation that's sixty three thousand dollars Texas is even a more robust compensation framework compensating wrongfully convicted eighty dollars per year and an annuity said at the same amount and but essentially compensating you for what was taken because if you if you are convicted of a crime you did commit we'd take away your freedom well if we take away your freedom what do we give back when you get out the only thing that you can really look for is money and if he was imprisoned in Texas instead of Kansas they would have given him one point eight four million dollars for the time he spent behind bars this weird way to look at it because it's a monetary compensation but like it's something it makes sense we you know you drink the hot coffee that doesn't have a label on it you get millions of dollars if someone takes away your your freedom for 23 years I don't know yeah it's look it's the least we can do and so at one point eight four million is a lot of money I get it and but you you and I didn't spend twenty three years in prison would you trade your life from the age of seventeen to the age of 41 for one point eight four million dollars as much money as that is hell no what are you just trading away your life what's the point of the money and all those quotes are so positive he's like I'm not looking back I'm looking forward I don't want to be angry I don't want any I just want to be positive and look toward my future and it's like okay I'm glad he's that way I'm pissed off for him and I want some kind of justice if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm /join and once you do you'll be saying you know
