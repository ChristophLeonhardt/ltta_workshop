a school board member in South Carolina has posted something extremely questionable on her social media account and she refuses to resign following what she has posted her name is Cheri Todd and she is a Republican in South Carolina representing Carolina Forest and Myrtle Beach and she wanted to share some commentary in regard to the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh who is a Supreme Court justice now and she had written the following I've already decided that whoever wins the Democrat nomination in 2020 sexually assaulted me forty years ago that's classy so critics are calling for her to resign she has refused to do so the only response that she has given the media is the following she said that she did not share the post and was hacked yeah no there's a lot of people hacking into Horry County school board members Facebook sites and going hmm yeah that's right how shall i frame a joke that is incredibly mediocre and used the word democratic sort of democratic and and put it into the school board members so that she could be in a little bit of trouble but since she's a Republican she'll probably be fine that's not a thing that happens what happens instead is Republicans make terrible jokes about sexual assault I don't even think that she's joking I mean look do I think she's actually gonna do that no but it gives you a sense of the way their mind works like to them everything that dr. Blasi Ford said during that hearing was just made up and it was just political which is such a strange thing to put yourself through right I don't care how much you care about politics to put yourself through the type of torture that dr. Ford had to go through for politics is inconceivable to me and even Trump himself said behind the scenes not publicly to his aides why didn't you guys tell me she would sound this credible I this reminds me of of the fervor and which people support their sports teams in that I remember being involved in a baseball game and I for some sick reason was more objective than the rest and our guy was out at first by half a step and everyone and he was called out everyone on our bench went ballistic and everyone on their bench went ballistic that he was out and we all claimed that he was safe so when when the emotions get involved and the fervor becomes at a high pitched you lose your sense of reason and that's part of the reason why anything that might be legitimate legitimate criticism a legitimate accusation immediately is assumed to be false and we're and it's it's not a lot different than it was in the Clinton days because a lot of the progressives and Democrats didn't want to believe that that those accusations were were accurate and true not as not to the degree of fervor that we're seeing today but both sides are guilty of it in this case you have a very legitimate accuser being to completely deal ajith amaizing to me yeah look I'll go further look I'm I've been guilty of it and so you know I used to be a Republican and so during the Anita Hill hearings I didn't believe her why cuz I was on Team Republican and it's not because I thought sis I'm a Republican I'm going to back Clarence Thomas no I genuinely believed that he hadn't done it because you get yourself to believe it's right and and honest good for your topic it's not goofy overall but it's goofy in that I cared about it like the team as you're saying Richard Roethlisberger I don't want to believe that because I'm a Steelers fan what he was accused of I mean the topic is incredibly serious but like why do you care so much about your team that you know that you are predisposed to to believing one thing rather than the other so we all got to get past that so I've been there I've been Oh stupid common ok get past that but it's being it's being taken advantage of or or this the fires are being stoked by this particular administration obviously in the ways that we did haven't seen since the 1930s right in Germany and and so that flaw that we all have is being taken advantage of and and that's what that's where it gets dangerous in the events of today are a very good example of that yeah and look I I like the thing that we a little bit better and and that we're a little bit more open-minded these days we as in me us but but you guys two of your progressives and or independents look because here's I'll give you examples right so it's easy to say well Harvey Bill Cosby I love Bill Cosby we found out that he did monstrous things okay so we got past our love for Bill Cosby how everyone see I never had any love for in the first place but I gave it Democrats I don't really care about that so that's not a great example louis c.k is a good example yeah cuz we missing Apple he's so truthful in his comedy you want him to you know we want him to get to come back and get past this but he can't and and understandably why yeah that is a good example not yeah and for me it's it's John Conyers the guy's a legend okay yes in a lot of ways civil rights hero and one of the longest-serving congressmen a wonderful progressive and Democrat and it looks like he did sexual harassment and he had to resign right so and and I hate that that happened but it's not anybody else's fault but his he's the one who did it right so but we're willing to say all those things we're willing to be honest too much too much so even to the point of Al Franken well I was just gonna bring out Franken up so I feel like you brought up a really great point in the Clinton years and how I was too young so I didn't have a reaction because my mom wouldn't let me know what was going on for we don't like you now but what I do want to mention is that I feel like the pendulum has swung in like the extreme opposite direction for for people on the left because now on the left it's I feel like that's the only place in the pool where there's a lot of criticism where we hold each other accountable where we criticize one another almost too aggressively sometimes not in regard to sexual assault allegations but for anything else well is that there's an inherent problem in being a progressive or a Democrat and and that is that there's a presumption on on those that are our leaders that they are on the side of good and therefore they have a standard to live up to and what we're seeing especially from this administration is that that's irrelevant there's no there's no facade it's it's it's it's unadulterated pursue pursuit of whatever their agenda is sometimes it's hard to figure it out except to create division and and disturbance and here it is they've created division to the point where people assume that dr. Blasi Ford is wrong they assume it's a conspiracy and they joke around about oh yeah we'll hatch a conspiracy next time and so look no matter worry which side of the political aisle you're from we hope that you keep an open mind but but one side can seems to these days consistently being the tight camp of facts be damned there are alternative facts and hypocrisy is not interesting or relevant to us we don't care where for our team and and so if you admit John Conyers did something wrong well that's a weakness on your part you should have never admitted that we just always strongly deny it and we're done with it right do you remember when you first heard the term alternative facts yes who was it from Kellyanne cotton Italian Conway and I keep thinking to that moment and I just wonder if it's a term that was used in meetings that she forgot not to say out loud and then it became a Webster term right it's amazing yeah and it just feels like it's as if she was stumped for that moment and she says did well there are alternative facts and but that's the directive in the meetings and it's very specifically based on the propaganda and again I go back to the 1930s in Germany where alternative facts was was a strategy a strategy yeah and last thing on this is and that's where the political correctness comes from both from Stalinist days and from fascist Germany days and Nazi days honestly where they said that might be correct what whatever you're saying about name it like Aryan Nation is not actually genetically superior but it's not politically correct so you're not allowed to say it even if it's true that's where the term politically correct comes from you had to present alternative facts to what were actually correct facts because that was a politically correct thing to do and so it's an interesting theory that you have that they were discussing internally perhaps what hey we should give them alternative facts and in that moment she blurted it out because but with as you see what Donald Trump often - he says things he shouldn't say if he was savvy politician and was trying to disguise things he just blurts it out he said well I just wanted to end the Russian investigation that's why I fired Comey oops I just said that out loud no thank well one final thing that I want to add to this is that this is a woman on a school board in you know in South Carolina and can we just please have higher standards for people who make decisions for our kids and for their futures because if this is her her school of thought when it comes to sexual assault allegations I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable having her as part of the school board if my child was part of that district on the go don't worry we got you covered if you still listen to TYT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google Play Store or at TYT comm slash podcast
