Dave 532 of the Trump administration an EPA Administrator Scott through it joins the list of high-profile departures from the White House hours ago Pruitt sent his resignation letter to the President as he faced the growing fallout from a whole bunch of ethnic scandals they include spending taxpayer money on a $43,000 soundproof soundproof phone booth a sweetheart deal on a condo rental linked to a lobbyist and ordering aides to help him obtain a used mattress from Trump's hotel in Washington right now Pruitt is the subject of 15 ongoing federal investigations earlier today in a tweet President Trump announced that he had accepted through its resignation he wrote quote within the agency Scott has done an outstanding job and I will always be thankful to him for this Arizona goes on to write the Senate confirmed deputy epa andrew wheeler will on monday assumed duties at the Acting Administrator of the EPA in his own resignation letter Pruitt praised President Trump and the EPA's work he refers to improved environmental outcomes and historic regulatory reform and he goes on to say it is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in this role first because I counted as a blessing to be serving you in any capacity but also because of the transformative work that is occurring however the unrelenting attacks on me personally my family are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us earlier today as president Trump was traveling to a rally in Montana aboard Air Force One he told reporters there was quote no final straw and quote when it came to Pruitt's resignation he said it was Pruitt's decision to step down but the New York Times reports quote on Thursday afternoon around 1:30 mr. Trump's chief of staff John F Kennedy wrote to tell him the time had come the president also told reporters that he's narrowed his possible Supreme Court picks to about four people a source familiar with the selection process told NBC News the list is actually down to three these three Brett Kavanaugh Amy Kony Barrett and Raymond Catholic and at tonight's rally in Great Falls the president was teasing up his big reveal as you know there's now a vacancy on the Supreme Court and if you turn in Monday at nine o'clock I think you're going to be extremely happy now from there you could say things went off the rails among many other things the president went after Maxine Waters Elizabeth Warren and the NFL we turned away thousands of people they never say I'm a great speaker why the hell do so many people come I have broken more Elton John records he seems to have a lot of Records and we beat and I by the way I don't have a musical instrument I don't have a guitar or an organ no organ Elton has an organ yes she is a low IQ individual Maxine Waters I said it the other day hi I mean honestly she's somewhere in the mid-60s I believe Pocahontas they always want me to apologize for saying it and I hereby oh no I want to apologize I'll use tonight Pocahontas I apologize to you I apologize to you I apologize to the to the fake Pocahontas I want yes we are already building the wall it started in California in San Diego I've directed the Pentagon to begin a process of creating a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces called the space force hey how about the NFL look I don't want to cause controversy they pass this stupid thing you don't have to do this anymore if you don't respect the flag or if you don't like the country or whatever it is just go into the locker room just go into the LA I think in many respects that's worse this is that worse than not standing let's bring in our leadoff panel for a Thursday night Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for The New York Times and then as MSNBC political analyst Annie Carney's the White House reporter for Politico and Kimberly Atkins chief Washington reporter for the Boston Herald and an MSNBC contributor Annie the border wall is not being built we've already fact checked that the racial slur the Pocahontas thing continues the u.s. is a signatory to an international agreement not to militarized space but I don't know that this is picked up yet you know I haven't seen enough traction around this but the president criticized the me to movement in his criticism of Elizabeth Warren these rallies tend to go off the rails this one was spectacular it's surprising to hear and bring up the me to movement Trump the president doesn't have a lot of holding himself back and it's not a subject that is helpful to him given that there are more than half a dozen women who have accused him of sexual misconduct and more so to hear him and bring up that subject when he is part of it was a surprising turn the attacks on Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren's team was probably loving it I think the Democrats are all like waiting for their turn to be Trump's or a pinata that day and the attacks on the NFL we the White House officials have explained that this is his 2020 strategy and his midterm strategy to run on culture wars that part of it was kind of the Trump playbook play but the the bring up me too especially in the same day that they officially announced that bill shine will be a deputy chief of staff and the communications director this is a former Fox executive who was involved with cover ups for Roger Ailes was a surprising was probably the most eyebrow-raising moment and by the way he brought it up in connection to the conversation about Pocahontas and Elizabeth Warren let just play that for our viewers let's say I'm debating Pocahontas right I promise you I'll do this I will take you know those little kits they sell on television for two dollars learn your heritage guy says I was born in Scotland it turns out he was born in Puerto Rico and that's okay it's good you know guy says I was born in Germany well he wasn't born in Germany was born someplace else I'm gonna get one of those little kids and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims that she's of Indian heritage because her mother said she has high cheekbones that's her only evidence that her mother said she had hygiene bug we will take that little kit and say but we have to do it gently because we're in the me two generations who have to be very gentle and we will very gently take that kid and we will slowly toss it hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm even though it only weighs probably two ounces and we will say I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity paid for it by Trump if you take the test that it shows you're an Indian Peter Baker does not sound like a guy who's all bent out of shape about losing a cabinet secretary today but he did there was a resignation or an invitation to submit a letter of resignation from Scott Pruett earlier today what's your reporting on how that went down and particularly what John Kelly's role wasn't it yeah with John Kelly has been ready get rid of just scott pruett for quite a while his own tenure in the White House John Kelly's tenure in the White House needs to be short and we don't seem to be expecting him to be lasting much longer but on the way out he wanted to make sure that Pruett went first I think he was offended by the various scandals the use of government resources for his personal gain for his family's gain I you know offended a career marine general who had basically spent decades in the service of his country and I think that if he was going to do one thing before he left the White House he was going to to make sure the president accept the resignation of Scott Pruitt but you know it's interesting to hear the president these rallies you know this is a this is not a president speaking so much as a television entertainer he knows his audience he he loves nothing more than a good provocative line or a series of lines this thing was just Warren has been obsession for him for quite a long time a certain irony there of course because he wants claimed or his own family claimed to be from Sweden when in fact they were actually from Germany but you know this is a regular trope of his he he gets good reaction from his crowd he likes to to poke and prod and and to generate some sort of a reaction on the part of the Democrats tymberlee kind of hard to imagine we're a few days away from the president nominating a Supreme Court pick with all the the noise swirling around it but the president announced here that his announcement will be made at nine o'clock on Monday we don't know whether that's 9:00 a.m. or p.m. I'm assuming 9:00 a.m. but he says he's going to make this pick on Monday we're reporting that it is down to three nominees three potential candidates Cavanaugh Barrett and Catholic what's your thought on where this is going yeah I mean I do believe that the president met in the evening I think he wants to build it up as a prime-time special the same way that he rolled out the nomination of Neal Gorsuch his first Supreme Court pick but yes I mean it's it wouldn't be a mistake to say this is probably one of the most consequential things that this president can do in in his term is nominate another conservative to the US Supreme Court which is what's going to happen on Monday regardless of the three finalists that he picks it seems to me I'm told that Brett Cavanaugh who is a DC Circuit Court of Appeals judge is at the top of this list because the president simply likes him he has a good feel for him you know the President had likes to trust his own gut and people who he likes in making this pick of course he's selecting from a carefully honed list of people put together by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation conservatives that he knew that the evangelicals and the other conservative Republicans would love so it's not a big stretch between them but somebody who he seems to like but yes you're right this is this is a time that the president should be talking about this and only this rather than going to where he seems to be going tonight with the attacks on the Elizabeth Warren and others especially given the fact that in the midterms and Beyond in 2020 the president and the Republicans are going to need are going to need suburban women and in this case the two big things that we have you see him attack several women today in his speech you see him make fun of the me2 movement and there is a lot of concern that whomever he appoints to the US Supreme Court might be willing to overturn roe v wade these are all things that seems to be politically against the president at this time but in all these cases he's doubling down and he thinks he has the right strategy hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
