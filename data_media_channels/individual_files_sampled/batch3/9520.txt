AND GREG GUTFELD. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY, AND THIS IS "THE FIVE" ." PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSING TWO MAJOR ISSUES TODAY WHILE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA, INCLUDING HIS SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN. WE WILL GET TO HIS COMMENTS ON THAT IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST THE PRESIDENT IS COMMENTING FOR THE FIRST TIME ON CAMERA ABOUT AN FBI INFORMANT COMMUNICATING WITH ASSOCIATES OF HIS CAMPAIGN. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY HAD SPIES IN MY CAMPAIGN. I HOPE THERE WEREN'T, FRANKLY. BUT SOME MAN GOT PAID BASED ON WHAT I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WANTS TO GET DOWN TO IT AND I CAN TELL YOU CONGRESS DOES. IF THEY HAD SPIES IN MY CAMPAIGN, DURING MY CAMPAIGN FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES, THAT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. Dana: 'S MENTOR CHUCK SCHUMER SAYING THESE MOVES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE INFORMANT ATTEMPT TO OBSTRUCT THE INVESTIGATION. DEMANDS FOR OVERSIGHT ARE TANTAMOUNT TO INTERFERENCE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FOLKS DEMANDING THE INFORMATION ARE THE MOST BIASED, IRRESPONSIBLE ACTORS, A MAN LIKE DEVIN NUNES, WHO I HEAR PRIVATELY FOR MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES THINK HE IS OFF THE DEEP END. Dana: ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S ALL SORTS OF STUFF GOING ON. HERE'S A QUESTION, KIMBERLY. THE PRESIDENT HAS THE POWER IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO DECLASSIFY ALL THESE DOCUMENTS. WITHOUT BE A GOOD IDEA? Kimberly: I'M GLAD THAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION. IT'S FASCINATING AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE CALLING FOR IT, SAYING LET'S GO COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY, DECLASSIFY THE DOCUMENTS, END. ALL OTHER SO THERE ISN'T THIS LEAKING THIS AND LEAKING THAT. BITS AND PIECES OUT. SHOW THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK AND EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO DID WHAT. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED AT THIS POINT INSTEAD OF LIKE DRIP FROM THE FAUCET COMING DOWN. PUT IT ALL OUT THERE, AND THEN WE WILL KNOW. Dana: WHAT DO YOU THINK, BRIAN? Brian: A LEGAL EXPERT WILL SAY THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE SOMEBODY INSIDE RUSSIA THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW THAT ARE HELPING US TODAY. I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE DOING A COUNTERTERROR OPERATION, WHY DON'T YOU START WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO INFILTRATE, THE RUSSIANS. SHOW SOME GUTS, GO TO RUSSIAN ESTIMATES GOING ON. OR USE YOUR CONTACTS TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY. INSTEAD YOU'RE GOING UP TO THESE ANCILLARY PEOPLE ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND NOBODY SAYS THEY ARE MAJOR PLAYERS. TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE WHISPERED TO THEM IN A DRUNKEN CONVERSATION. FOR PEOPLE TO SAY, LIKE CHUCK SCHUMER, IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE TO ALLOW THESE PEOPLE TO FIND OUT WHO HAS INFILTRATED YOUR CAMPAIGN. IF ANYONE INFILTRATED CHUCK SCHUMER'S CAMPAIGN, THEY WOULDN'T SAY THE FBI WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR SOURCES. I DON'T BLAME PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR BEING OUTRAGED, TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON ARE NOT GOING ON WITH THIS CAMBRIDGE PROFESSOR. I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR FINDING OUT CARTER PAGE, AND CAPUTO, WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THESE GUYS. THE ONLY THING AT STAKE IS HIS PRESIDENCY AND HOW LONG HE STAYS PRESIDENCY AND HOW LONG HE STAY STAYS. Dana: JUAN, LET ME ASK YOU. THE IDEA THAT IF THE DEEP STATE, IF WE ARE CALLING IT BACK, WAS SO DETERMINED TO HURT PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHAT ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS FEELING LIKE THEY ACTUALLY HURT CLINTON MORE BECAUSE THEY KEPT THE FBI INVESTIGATION INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN UNDER WRAPS BUT WERE MORE FORTHCOMING IN THE PRESS ABOUT QUENTIN. Juan: IT CONTRADICTS THE WHOLE FLOOR WHAT YOU ARE SEEN COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT. THE CAMPAIGN THAT WAS HURT BY THE FBI WAS THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE DONE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. IN FACT, SOME PEOPLE ARE ARGUING THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE CONDUCTING COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS AS OPPOSED TO A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO PROTECT AND TRY TO ACT AS A BUFFER TO KEEP THE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE OUT OF ALL THE CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SEEING NOW IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION, DANA, AN EFFORT BY THE PRESIDENT. I THINK IT'S UNPRECEDENTED TO SORT OF WEAPONIZED INVESTIGATION INTO THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIM. Dana: ISN'T WEAPONIZING, GREG, IF IT IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYING WE HAVE AN INSPECTOR GENERAL HOWEVER ONE SEEMS TO SUPPORT, MICHAEL HOROWITZ, BECAUSE HE IS A FAIR GUY. HE SAYS HE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. CAN WE LET IT PLAY OUT? COULD BE MONTHS. Greg: WHAT IS RUSSIAN FOR MEXICAN STANDOFF? THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. I SEE THE OPPOSITE. HILLARY'S INVESTIGATION WAS PUT IN THE PRESS TO HELP HER. REMEMBER WHAT COMEY SAID, HAVE TO GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE IF SHE WINS AND IT COMES OUT, WE LOOK REALLY BAD. SO LET'S HELP HER. TRUMP WAS KEPT UNDER WRAPS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CATCH THEM. WHY IS THIS ONE KNOWN. YOU CAN LOOK AT IT ANYWAY. Dana: OR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE WASN'T GOING TO WIN. Greg: YOU WILL GO BACK TO THE LAUREL AND YANNY. WHICH COLLUSION STORY IS MORE PERSUASIVE. THE STORY, IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR 18 MONTHS. ON THE OTHER SIDE, FBI, HOWEVER, DEMOCRATS, BRITISH BUY. ONE INFORMANT, MAY BE TWO. IF YOU COMPARE THESE TWO SIDES, YOU HAVE ONE WITH A MEETING ABOUT THE MISSING SKI ACT YOU HAVE A DOSSIER PAID FOR BY HILLARY. YOU HAVE BEEN INFORMANT, MAY BE TWO, PLACED AS A FAVOR. YOU HAVE THE PRESS PLAYING IT DOWN. YOU HAVE THE DOSSIER CONTENTS LEAKED. WE START COMPARING THESE THINGS, ONE IS MAKING MORE SENSE THAN THE OTHER. Juan: I THINK YOU WOULD I THINK YOU ARE GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE. Greg: WE HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN FOR 18 MONTHS. EXCUSE ME IF I FIND ANOTHER RABBIT HOLE. Brian: "WASHINGTON POST" BEGAN TO LEAK OUT INFORMATION TO MAYBE GET A HEAD TO LET US KNOW THERE'S A RABBIT HOLE. I THINK ALAN DERSHOWITZ NAILED IT WHEN HE SAID I DON'T CARE OF IT IS THE '98 CLINTON INVESTIGATION, NOW THE 2016 CLINTON-TRUMP CAMPAIGN. YOU'LL NEVER GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AS LONG AS IT IS THIS TYPE OF OPERATION. WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE 9/11 COMMISSION TO GET ANSWERS, PUBLISH THE RESULTS BECAUSE IT DID NOT EFFECT THE ELECTION. YOU JUST FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG TO STOP THE NEXT PROBLEM BECAUSE THIS HORSE IS OUT OF THE BARN AND NO ONE EVEN SAW THE HORSE. Juan: I THINK THE PROBLEM, FIRST OF ALL, THIS LATEST EFFORT TO SOMEHOW SAY I HEREBY DEMAND, LIKE HE'S NOT PRESIDENT BUT SOME AUTHORITARIAN RULER. I HEREBY DEMAND. WHAT HAPPENED, GREG, IMMEDIATELY ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID OKAY, I'M GOING TO DO THIS. THE QUESTION IS HE TRYING TO APPEASE THE PRESIDENT OR SEE FOLLOWING ORDERS? Greg: YOU ARE OBSESSING OVER WORDS. I HEREBY SOUNDS LIKE KING ARTHUR'S CASTLE. Juan: SURE DOES. SOUNDS LIKE A KING, NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU ARE NORMALIZING THIS KIND OF ABUSE OF A POWER WHILE THE PRESIDENT IS UNDER A SPECIAL INVESTIGATION. Brian: WHAT I THINK EVERYONE IS MISSING. TRUMP HIRED THIS FOREIGN POLICY COUNCIL HE GOT ON THE BACK OF A CHEERIOS BOX THEY GO OUT AND DO THEIR THING AND SOMEHOW THEY AREN'T TARGETED BY THIS INFORMANT. Dana: THE GOVERNMENT TOLD THEM THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING TO TRY TO DO THIS. THEY KNEW. THE PEOPLE ON THE CAMPAIGN COMMODE WE KNOW THEY HAVE THESE CONTACTS. MICKEY MOUSE WHATEVER DRUNKEN THINGS. THOSE WEREN'T DISCLOSED, KIMBERLY, SO THEN YOU HAVE THIS QUESTION. I AGREE, THE LAUREL AND YANNY THING. 12 HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE ASKING FOR A SECOND SPECIAL COUNSEL. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS SO MUCH LONGER AND LEAD THE SHOW EVERY DAY FOR THE NEXT TEN MONTHS, THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO DO IT. Greg: YOU ARE SAYING KEEP GOING WITH THIS OTHER INVESTIGATION WE WILL KEEP SAYING Dana: I AM SAYING RELEASE ALL THE DOCUMENTS TOMORROW. Greg: YOU SHOULD ALSO SAY IF THEY THINK THIS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT, THEN IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT. Kimberly: WE CONCUR ON THAT THEY SHOULD RELEASE THE DOCUMENTS. I THINK WE WILL THEN GET ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL. LET'S HAVE THE IG REPORT, HAVE THE DOCUMENTS RELEASED, CERTAINLY WITHIN THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO DO SO. IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING. HE IS THING LET'S PUT IT ALL OUT THERE AND AS IT RELATES TO ANY PEOPLE WE HAVE OPERATING THE THEATER THEY COULD RECOVER MOST, YOU CAN REDACT THEIR NAMES.
