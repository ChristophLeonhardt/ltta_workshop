00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
hi guys so I'm coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you today from</font>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of a lake this is just what</font>

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,629
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in Wisconsin in the winter when</font>

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,309
the weather gets all frizzy we just go

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">for like low-key strolls across the top</font>

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,830
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> frozen water and this isn't like a</font>

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,160
little skating pond either this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a 15</font>

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,320
square mile lake I'm standing on top of

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,930
so why walk across sheet of breakable

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,390
water when there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly safe</font>

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,580
and non potentially life-threatening

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,859
land that it'll do first I don't know if

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,660
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed but looks like the</font>

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,840
horizon just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on forever out here</font>

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,430
I've never been to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the desert but I</font>

16
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,660
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what</font>

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,309
walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the desert feels like</font>

18
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,309
where your concept of distance gets a

19
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,260
little warped<font color="#CCCCCC"> it feels like you can see</font>

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,780
forever and walk forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the sky is</font>

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,200
just huge and beautiful but it doesn't

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,059
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that from onshore it's only</font>

23
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,070
out here<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're in the middle of</font>

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,579
things reason number two it's slidy I

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,430
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one explains itself reason</font>

26
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,590
number three is interesting ice things

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,690
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things that nature does</font>

28
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,299
just on the regular as if it's no big

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,920
deal that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually see or notice</font>

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,110
because we're usually not standing out

31
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,360
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the lake but there's</font>

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,180
spots where you can see where the water

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,490
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of was laughing over sheets of</font>

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,130
partially frozen ice so it freezes and

35
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,409
wave patterns there's spots where the

36
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,350
top layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all like spiky and angular</font>

37
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,960
and it looks kind of scarred but when

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,420
you step<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it it shatters like glass</font>

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,520
and your feet but there's still like a

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,400
solid foot of ice beneath it there's big

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,619
bubbles and little bubbles and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,170
spots where it's totally like white and

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,030
opaque and their spots that look so

44
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,680
clear it kind of freaks you out to walk

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,790
on it because it feels like you're

46
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,590
walking on nothing there's also spots

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,630
where you can see little green pieces of

48
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,030
seaweed frozen into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ice today the</font>

49
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,619
entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is covered up with a layer</font>

50
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,549
of snow but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these are enormously</font>

51
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,399
better than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey / and the balled up</font>

52
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,640
plastic bags and occasionally the frozen

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,829
vomit that I usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> find on the</font>

54
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,500
sidewalk

55
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,360
and finally reason number for that I

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,550
like going for walks on top of the lake

57
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,370
is because it probably should scare me

58
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,070
but it doesn't I used to be an extremely

59
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,590
timid person in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years i</font>

60
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,870
think i've become a lot more brave it's

61
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,310
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite things about myself</font>

62
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,440
and so I think it's important to remind

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,380
myself how brave I am sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

64
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,420
my battery died so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

65
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,190
to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my phone I think it's</font>

66
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,560
important to remind myself how brave I

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,780
actually am even if it's silly so tell

68
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,490
