the queue outside Hall number one began forming more than two hours early some have doubts about Boris Johnson's political future others see him as a potential prime minister there's no doubt he can draw a crowd like no other in the current Conservative Party and it was his defiant rejection of the prime minister's checkers plan for brexit which most excited his loyal audience think what we could do if we had proper free trade deals and that is why it is so sad and so desperately wrong though we are preparing to agree terms with Brussels that would make it much more difficult if not impossible to do such deals and that's why it was such a mistake of us - is such a mistake of us to lead to leave on the the checkers terms locked in the tractor beam Boris Johnson is the rock star of this conference this fringe event attracting bigger audiences than those in the main but his appearance here underlines just how divisive a character he is and just how deep the struggle for brexit is within this party Tuesday's flagship policy statements on immigration and visa reform were totally eclipsed by Boris's appearance and his totemic status among brexit supporters continuously undermines the Prime Minister with a crucial EU summit just a couple of weeks away yes obviously there was some undermining of the PM but I think Boris is absolutely pushing for what we need and I think at the moment the Conservative Party do need somebody with a little bit more personality really pushing forward some of the key issues here and I think Boris is absolutely the person to do that he raises some very good points he's his hearts in the right place he's trying to challenge what's being done there are ways of doing it some of us agree with him some I was don't agree with him most people actually think that what has become of the annual Boris show he arrives for a day he makes a funny speech and then then goes to get we have trailed along with you by the entire world's media actually it's a bit of a distraction one of Boris Johnson's aides had predicted he would hit this conference like a ninja but this was more smash-and-grab than stealth-attack bought Brennan al-jazeera Birmingham
