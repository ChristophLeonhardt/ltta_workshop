by the time Yahoo was looking for yet another CEO Marissa Mayer had been at Google for thirteen years and she also had seen her career stall a bit over the past two or three so she was definitely looking for something new a new challenge to take her to the next level the key moment early on where Yahoo realized it wanted to hire Marissa Mayer and Marissa Mayer realized she wanted to go to Yahoo was when she flew to New York to meet with Michael Wolff one of Yahoo's board members at his apartment along with several other directors and she just wowed the board members in attendance with her knowledge of Yahoo's history and she already had a game plan for where she wanted to take the company they just totally blew them away going with someone like Marissa Mayer was a distinct choice for the Yahoo board they could have gone with Ross Levinson who is already interim CEO Levinson would have taken the company in a very different direction than it's been over the years he would have merged it with msn and turned it into a modern-day digital media company there is a serious debate on the board whether or not to go with Marissa Meyer or Ross Levinson and they wondered if Marissa Meyer was just a product executive whether she could be a fully rounded technology executive someone who could grow Yahoo's revenues as well as innovate products during Marissa Meyers first few months at Yahoo she made some really tough decisions that actually had nothing to do with product she really focused on the culture of the company before she joined employees were showing up at 9:00 10:00 in the morning and leaving by 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon within weeks they were showing up at 7:00 and no one was really gone till after 7:00 in the evening and what she did was she brought free food she started eating in the cafeteria herself she actually banned working from home she made this place a high-energy charged work environment and employees responded they really got into it
