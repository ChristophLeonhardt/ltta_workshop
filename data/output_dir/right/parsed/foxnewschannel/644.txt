YOU WILL.
>> I'M NOT PRO-RUSSIA,
PRO-ANYBODY.
I JUST WANT THIS COUNTRY TO
BE SAFE.
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE HAVING
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES
CONTROL 90% OF THE NUCLEAR
WEAPONS IN THE WORLD.
AND GETTING ALONG WITH
RUSSIA AND NOT ONLY FOR THAT
REASON, THAT'S A GOOD THING,
NOT A BAD THING.
BRIAN: THE PRESIDENT SAYS
THAT BEFORE AND HE SAID IT
IN THE PAST AND HE SAID IT
AINSLEY: RIGHT AFTER THE
PRESS CONFERENCE, TUCKER GOT
AND ONE LAST NIGHT.
ASSUME WHERE SHE LIVES.
GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS
MORNING.
THANKS FOR WAKING UP SUPER
EARLY.
>> OF COURSE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
AINSLEY: THANK YOU.
WAY THE MEDIA TREATED HIM?
>> THERE WERE MANY ON THE
LEFT AND OF COURSE SOME OF
OUR FAVORITE NEVER TRUMPERS
EVEN BEGAN BECAUSE THEY WILL
USE ANY EXCUSE TO BE
WHICH WAS TRY TO REPAIR
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING
ON FOR FAR TOO LONG AND
THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE
OF COLLUSION.
THIS PRESIDENT IS HE
THIS PRESIDENT IS FED UP AS
ARE MOST OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
IF THERE IS EVIDENCE OF
STOP WASTING OUR TIME
BECAUSE THE CANDIDATES, OR
THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO WIN,
DID NOT WIN IN 2016.
I'M FED UP.
I'M SURE EVERYONE WATCH
SOMETHING FED UP WITH THIS
AT THIS POINT.
STEVE: TOMI, THE RHETORIC
FROM THE LEFT REGARDING WHAT
HE SAID AND HE SAID HE
MISSPOKE YESTERDAY WHEN HE
CLARIFIED YESTERDAY IN THE
ROOSEVELT ROOM.
THE RHETORIC FROM THE LEFT
HAS BEEN HYPERBOLIC.
WHAT HE SAID WAS WORSE THAN
9/11, WORSE THAT CRYSTAL
KNOCK.
PEARL HARBOR HE IS A TRAITOR
AND TREASONOUS.
SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS LIKE
THAT ON THE LEFT.
>> OH, THESE ARE THE FINAL
STAGES OF TRUMP DERANGEMENT
SYNDROME AND YOU WILL SEE IT
MORE AND MORE AS WE HEAD
INTO MID TERMS.
WAGE WAR AGAINST RUSSIA
BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON LOST
THE ELECTION?
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SELECTIVE
OUTRAGE FROM THE LEFT, IT
WOULD ALMOST SEEM AS IF THAT
IS WHAT THEY WANT.
TOWARDS DIPLOMACY AND WORLD
PEACE OR WOULD YOU LIKE HIM
TO BE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS
RUSSIA BECAUSE HILLARY
CLINTON LOST THE ELECTION?
VERY SIMPLE.
BRIAN: RIGHT.
LET'S JUST LOOK AT THE
RESULTS.
THE TAX CUT WAS ONLY FOR THE
RICH, REALLY?
LOOK AT THE ECONOMY.
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT
NORTH KOREA, WELL, IT WAS
ALL FALLING APART.
TALKS AREN'T GOING WELL.
YESTERDAY, WE GOT THE
REMAINS, I UNDERSTANDING, OF
50 NORTH KOREAN WAR
VETERANS.
SO THAT IS ON TRACK.
NOW WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING
THAT IF THE RUSSIA DEAL
COMES FORWARD, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE A SERIES OF
CONSISTENT MEETINGS WITH
HIGHER UPS IN RUSSIA FOR THE
MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IN
THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
THE RESULTS AND THE ANGER
THE RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT.
AND THEY ARE TURNING OUT THE
WAY THE PRESIDENT SAYS.
>> DO YOU THINK THE
DEMOCRATS WANT THIS
PRESIDENT TO HAVE ANY
VICTORIES?
INTO THIS PRESIDENCY.
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT YOU
MENTIONED, ALL
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, IT ALMOST
>> THERE IS A 28-YEAR-OLD
POLITICAL NEWCOMER.
SHE IS A SOCIALIST.
WHO WON THE DEMOCRATIC
HER NAME ALEXANDER OCASIO
CORTEZ.
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE REALLY
HAS A HANDLE ON HOW THE JOBS
THING WORKS.
BUT SHE HAD THIS OBSERVATION
>> UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW
BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS TWO
JOBS.
UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE
BARELY FEED THEIR KIDS.
AND SO I DO THINK RIGHT NOW
WE HAVE THIS NO HOLDS BARRED
ANY COST.
CAPITALISM HAS NOT ALWAYS
EXISTED IN THE WORLD.
SO WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HER
ECONOMICS IDEA WHERE
EVERYBODY, THE REASON
UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE
EVERYBODY HAS GOT TWO JOBS?
>> ISN'T IT DISTURBING THAT
THE, QUOTE, FUTURE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOESN'T
KNOW HOW THE UNEMPLOYMENT
BE A BETTER FACE FOR THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAN
HILLARY CLINTON BUT THEN
ALEXANDER OCASIO CORTEZ CAME
ALONG.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S
DISTURBING BUT LIKE I TOLD
YOU GUY AS COUPLE WEEKS AGO,
IF THIS IS TRULY THE NEW
FACE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
I REALLY LIKE OUR CHANCES IN
NOVEMBER.
BRIAN: A COUPLE OF THINGS,
LIKE WHEN TALENTED PEOPLE
LIKE YOU AND HER SHE HAS
TALENT GET INTO POLITICS.
I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN
IN FACT JOE LIEBERMAN CAME
OUT YESTERDAY AND SAID JOE
CROWLEY SHOULD DO WHAT I
DID.
WHEN I LOST MY PRIMARY I
SEAT JOE CROWLEY SHOULD GO
TRY DO THAT DO YOU THINK HE
SHOULD GO TRY TO DO THAT?
>> FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR
COUNTRY I WOULD HOPE THAT
REASONABLE DEMOCRATS ARE
COMING FORWARD AND
CHALLENGING SOMEONE LIKE
LEANED
ALANED
ALEXED
ALEXANDER CORTEZ.
A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE
LOOKING AT HER AS THE FUTURE
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
DESERVES BETTER.
AND WE DON'T NEED LEADERS
LIKE HER PREACHING THE VALUE
OF SOCIALISM TO OUR YOUNG
PEOPLE, TO OUR CITIZENS.
PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE WHO WAS
AND IS HE A SOCIALIST.
BRIAN: YEP.
RECEIVE STEVE HERE SHE IS
TODAY.
AINSLEY: YOU HAVE TO ALSO
CONSIDER, TOO, HER REGION
WHERE SHE LIVES.
SHE LIVES IN NEW YORK.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MESSAGE
WOULD ALSO WORK IN OTHER
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE
YOU DO HAVE BLUE STATES.
