16
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,721
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

17
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:26,322

18
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:27,590
>> Dana: YOU WERE GOING TO

19
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,891
BE ON LATE LAST WEEK AND

20
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:30,693
BECAUSE OF THE UNFORTUNATE,

21
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:32,127
THE SAD SITUATION IN TEXAS WE

22
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:33,696
WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THIS.

23
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:35,364
BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOU MADE AN

24
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:36,432
ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THAT THE

25
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:39,068
ISSUE OF GETTING DRUGS TO

26
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:40,503
GENERICS IS A HIGH PRIORITY

27
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:42,004
AND IT'S THE BEST WAY TO TRY

28
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:44,240
TO GET THE PRICES DOWN.

29
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,908
HOW WAS THAT ACTUALLY MET IN

30
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:47,176
TERMS OF REACTION FROM THE

31
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:52,748
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES?

32
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,016
>> WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO

33
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,650
BRING COMPETITION IN THE

34
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,785
MARKET ACROSS A RANGE OF

35
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:57,486
DIFFERENT EFFORTS.

36
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:58,854
LAST WEEK WE PUBLISHED THE

37
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:00,356
NAMES OF COMPANY WHERE GENERIC

38
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:01,657
FIRMS COME TO US TELLING US

39
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:02,992
THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS

40
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:04,994
GETTING ACCESS TO THE DOSES OF

41
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,295
THE BRAND OF THE COMPANY DRUGS

42
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:07,963
THEY NEED TO DO CLINICAL

43
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:09,398
STUDIES TO GET THE GENERIC

44
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:10,599
DRUGS ON THE MARKET IN THE

45
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,467
FIRST PLACE.

46
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,669
SO WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES

47
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:14,904
COMPANIES ADOPT TACTICS TO

48
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:19,875
MAKE IT HARD FOR THE GENERIC

49
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:24,580
COMPANIES TO GET THE CLOSAGE

50
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,948
CLOSAGE -- DOSAGE FOR THE

51
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:26,315
APPROVAL.

52
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,150
SO WE PUBLISH A LIST OF THE 50

53
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,119
DRUGS WHERE THE GENERIC FIRMS

54
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,754
ARE HAVING A HARD TIME.

55
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:34,723
>> Dana: THE O.E.C.D., THE

56
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:35,558
ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC

57
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:36,959
COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT

58
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,261
SAYS THAT THE AVERAGE

59
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:39,962
CITIZEN'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG

60
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:43,065
COST IN 2015 IN DIFFERENT

61
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:46,802
COMPANIES, U.K. IS $479.

62
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:49,038
AND THE UNITED STATES IS

63
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:49,471
$1,116.

64
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:51,206
DO YOU THINK IF YOU WERE ABLE

65
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,508
TO GET MORE OF THE DRUGS TO

66
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:54,043
THE GENERICS THAT THE UNITED

67
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:55,611
STATES, COMMITMENT ON THAT

68
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:58,147
WOULD DRAMATICALLY DECLINE?

69
00:01:58,147 --> 00:01:59,415
>> THERE IS NOT A SILVER

70
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:00,382
BULLET HERE.

71
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:03,052
THERE IS NO SINGLE SOLUTION.

72
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:04,420
BUT GETTING MORE COMPETITION

73
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,921
IN THE MARKET HAS AN IMPACT ON

74
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:06,722
THE PRICES.

75
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:11,160
THIS IS NOT JUST JEER IF --

76
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,961
GENERIC DRUGS.

77
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,763
IT'S ALSO BRANDED DRUGS.

78
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:17,232
WE HAVE TO HAVE PRICE

79
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:17,633
COMPETITION.

80
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:20,436
PEOPLE WITH MONOPOLIES DON'T

81
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:21,804
>> Dana: LET ME ASK ABOUT

82
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:22,671
ONE OTHER THING.

83
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,872
THE HOUSE PASSED THE RIGHT TO

84
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,373
TRY BILL.

85
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:25,608
TAKE A LISTEN TO PRESIDENT

86
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:27,943
TRUMP ON THAT THE OTHER DAY.

87
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:28,644
>> President Trump: RIGHT TO

88
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:29,445
TRY PASSED.

89
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:31,013
WE'LL SIGN IT POSSIBLE

90
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:33,983
SOMETIME NEXT WEEK.

91
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:36,085
THIS GIVES PEOPLE HOPE.

92
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:38,020
WE CAN GO, THEY WILL SIGN A

93
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,589
WAIVER AND THEY WILL USE WHAT

94
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:41,156
THEY NEED.

95
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:42,958
AND IN THIS CASES THEY WILL BE

96
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:43,359
HELPED.

97
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,627
>> Dana: THIS HAS BEEN A BIG

98
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:45,628
PRIORITY FOR SOME FOR A LONG

99
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:45,961
TIME.

100
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:47,262
DO YOU THINK IT WILL HAVE AN

101
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:48,797
IMPACT ON PEOPLE SEEKING SOME

102
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,733
SORT OF HOPE IN TRIALS?

103
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,600
>> WE THINK IT WOULD.

104
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,901
WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING

105
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,470
COMMITMENT TO TRY TO PROVIDE

106
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,038
PROMISING DRUGS TO PARENTS WHO

107
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:57,473
ARE OUT OF OPTIONS AND HAVE

108
00:02:57,473 --> 00:02:58,374
TERMINAL CONDITIONS.

109
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:00,075
WE DO A GOOD JOB OF THAT.

110
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:02,111
WE GET A LOT OF DRUGS TO

111
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:04,780
PEOPLE FACING LONG ODDS OTHER

112
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,581
TERMINAL DISEASES.

113
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:07,883
WE THINK THIS IS A WAY TO GET

114
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:09,018
ACCESS TO PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN

115
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:10,119
SITUATIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD

116
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,020
TO IMPLEMENT IT.

117
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,221
>> Dana: I'LL ASK ABOUT

118
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,156
ANOTHER TOPIC SURE TO GET

119
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:15,391
ATTENTION IF IT DOES SPREAD.

120
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,860
THAT IS THE ISSUE OF EBOLA.

121
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,927
IN CONGO THERE HAVE BEEN A

122
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,496
COUPLE OF CASES THAT HAVE COME

123
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:22,898
UP, THAT FORCES THERE, THE

124
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:23,899
HEALTHCARE FORCES ARE TRYING

125
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:24,667
TO CONTAIN IT.

126
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,335
WHAT SORT OF RISKS DO WE HAVE

127
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:27,403
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IF

128
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:29,038
THIS DOES NOT STAY CONTAINED?

129
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:30,472
>> WELL, I THINK THE RISK TO

130
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:32,107
US IN THE U.S. IS MINIMAL.

131
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:34,009
BUT WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE

132
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,344
WOODS WITH RESPECT TO THE

133
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:35,644
D.R.C.

134
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:37,046
THERE ARE SOME CASES POPPED UP

135
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:38,614
THERE THAT ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR

136
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:39,782
AND THAT MEANS WE HAVEN'T BEEN

137
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:40,783
ABLE TO TRACE BACK HOW THE

138
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:41,884
PEOPLE GOT THE INFECTION.

139
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,218
SO THAT LEAVES OPEN TO

140
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:44,119
QUESTION THERE MAY BE

141
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:44,920
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO ARE

142
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,822
GOING TO COME DOWN WITH EBOLA

143
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:47,623
THERE AND ADDITIONAL PEOPLE

144
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,591
WHO ARE INFECTED.

145
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:52,528
WE HAVE HAD A PARADIGM CHANGE.

146
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,463
WE HAVE GONE FROM POSTURE OF

147
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:55,931
CONTAINMENT TO ONE WE ARE ABLE

148
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,534
TO OFFER PROTECTION WITH A NEW

149
00:03:58,534 --> 00:03:58,967
VACCINE.

150
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,102
>> Dana: HOW IS THAT ABLE TO

151
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:01,303
GET TO THE PEOPLE THERE?

152
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:03,105
I KNOW DISTRIBUTION TO THIS

153
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:04,573
TYPE OF VACCINE IS SOMETIMES

154
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,974
DIFFICULT IN AFRICA.

155
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:06,809
>> THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR

156
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:08,410
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE KEPT IN A

157
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,478
VERY COLD TEMPERATURE.

158
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:11,447
SO THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO

159
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:11,714
IT.

160
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:12,781
THEY GOT IT TO THE MAJOR CITY.

161
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,283
UP TO 8,000 DOSES IN.

162
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:15,584
THERE ARE MANY MORE DOSES THEY

163
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:16,752
COULD BRING IN, IF THEY HAVE

164
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:17,119
TO.

165
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,320
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING

166
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,089
IN THE LOGISTICS TO GET THE

167
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,023
VACCINE DISTRIBUTED TO THE

168
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:21,957
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN

169
00:04:21,957 --> 00:00:00,000
CONTACT WITH SOME OF THOSE
