let's watch a very different tone for president Trump and then his outgoing advisor we want to be able to get along with Russia getting along with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing now maybe we will and maybe we won't and probably nobody has been tougher to Russia than Donald Trump Russia brazenly and implausibly denies its actions and we have failed to impose sufficient costs nobody's been tougher on Russia than I have and you can and I know you're nodding yes because everyone agrees when they think about it mr. Putin might also then consider how the Russian people's aspirations connect his own population to us despite the Kremlin's efforts to sow dissension abroad and repress freedom at home I had a call with President Putin and congratulated him on the victory his electoral victory we might all help mr. Putin understand his grave error we might show him the beaches of Normandy were lingering craters and bullet holes demonstrate the West will to sacrifice to preserve our freedom I think I could have a very good relationship with Russia and with President Putin and if I did that would be a great thing and there's also a great possibility that that won't happen who knows what more of drama David corn Washington bureau chief her brother Jones and Arthur the number one bestseller in the country Russian roulette the inside story of Putin's war in America and the election of Donald Trump and Evelyn Farkas senior fellow at the Atlantic Council we just saw that and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia Ukraine and Eurasia both are MSNBC contributors were lucky for that I just made the wise guy comment that the only way you get truth out of people is on their way out the door and in comes HR McMaster David saying we've not done anything back we've been playing patty-cake with Russia they it's not just that they tried to undermine the thing we're proud of stuff in this country which is our democracy and try to humiliate in the US in the world to bring us down to their lousy level in terms of phony democracy but they're out there poisoning people in countries you know in the yearbook you talk about how to put radioactive material and somebody's pretty snatched all then more recently they do it they do it in our face well then we kiss back we throw more kisses back at them and then Trump says I've been tough on them you know III hate the term intervention or meddling in our election it was an attack this was an information cyber warfare attack and so when Donald Trump gets out there and says no one's been tougher as we talked about in the book the first thing they did when Trump came into office was try to weaken the sanctions and that weren't even that strong that Obama imposed on Putin for attacking us so what message does that send has Donald Trump said anything publicly critical Putin or this attack know what message does that send we have a northern coming up and in the book we talk about something that wasn't given a lot of attention at the time we focus on how they attacked the presidential election they also attacked Democratic congressional candidates and they showed how easily they could influence those elections so there is nothing tough and it's too bad McMaster only now raises this issue not now that he has no power to do anything but I've just seen darkest hour the fifth time I'll probably say and one thing Churchill says that Churchill had his flaws but one thing he said was you don't when I fight against the bad guy when you're meting when your heads in his mouth the Tiger's mouth and and here's Trump trying to charm sure Uyghur how do you charm this guy look at him no I'm Sharma got like Putin yeah in Germany after he's dumped all over since rendering humiliating us before the world and really has done lasting damage yeah George system I mean first of all Putin has basically started waging an undeclared war and what HR said yesterday at the Atlantic Council my think tank was he said you know starting in 2007 with this cyber attack on Estonia then 2008 when the Russians invaded Georgia they're still there occupying 20% of the territory and then on and on we have now I think it's up to you know attempted assassinations in the UK alone and then all the other things that the Russians have done and they've all been under this threshold whereby we didn't feel like they merited military response or even frankly speaking you know deniability they haven't really denied it it does anybody plausibly deniable but they do deny so they deny ever not any not an active war like Pearl Harbor that's all no I mean what they do is they it's below the threshold and then the other thing is that they for those people for whom it's convenient to cooperate with Russia because they have business dealings energy dealings and those people can include heads of state they have the ability to deny because the Russians are so vociferous li denied anyway Trump's desire for a relationship with to Putin goes back years in 2013 five years ago he tweeted you think Putin will be going to the Miss Universe pageant November Nova in Moscow if so will he become my new best friend that's in your book yeah what is this bromance these when is that says blowing kisses it's this I want to be best friends with but if you take a look at Putin he's probably the last guy you want to be friends with yeah and one way in one level it's inexplicable when he was in Miss Universe in November 2013 we report in the book he was obsessed with the idea of meeting Putin of Putin coming to the Miss Universe contest kept saying is he coming when am I going to talk to him I think there are two things here what is he new to do business and make money in Moscow which he was trying to do then he was trying to during the campaign you can't do that without Putin's approval so he's flattering some for that but also I think there's a psychological aspirational affinity that he has okay shaking her head yeah I agree him and Putin I think he likes the Russian business culture frankly speaking it's very macho you know you have shirt off looking like mr. mr. tough guy is that what he likes but we don't want to do that no I don't think that's the part although there is a PR aspect that he understands very well right I mean the TV cold I mean Putin doesn't do that in private you know he does it in front of the camera hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click
