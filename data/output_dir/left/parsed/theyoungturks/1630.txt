RECENTLY THERE WAS A
CONTROVERSY WITH MICHAEL COHEN
ACCEPTING PAYMENTS FROM
NOVARTIS, AT&T, AMONG OTHERS, HE
OF COURSE IS DONALD TRUMP'S
PERSONAL LAWYER, HE GOT OVER $2
MILLION FROM THESE PEOPLE AND
THEY WANTED TO INFLUENCE POLICY
OF COURSE.
FOR EXAMPLE, AT&T
WANTED TO GET THEIR MERGER
APPROVED WITH TIME WARNER.
HOWARD KURTZ SAYS THAT'S NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.
WHY?
HE MAKES A
GOOD POINT, HEAR HIM OUT.
LET ME TAKE A BROADER VIEW AND
THAT IS THE MEDIA IS SHOCKED TO
DISCOVER THAT THERE IS GAMBLING
IN CASABLANCA.
THEY HEAR ABOUT
THESE BIG COMPANIES -- I'M NOT
DEFENDING THIS PRACTICE BUT DC
IS A SWAMPY PLACE, THIS HAS GONE
ON FOR MANY, MANY
ADMINISTRATIONS WHERE YOU HIRE
SOMEONE WHO IS A FRIEND OF
SOMEBODY YOU HAVE HIRED FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR ACCESS AND SOMEBODY
WHO CAN CARRY YOUR MESSAGE.
OKAY, TOTALLY AGREED.
IT
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, WHERE
CORPORATIONS COME IN AND HIRE A
LOBBYIST, THEY HIRE FRIENDS OF
THE SENATORS, THEY HIRE FAMILY
MEMBERS OF THE SENATORS AND
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY HIRE
PEOPLE WHO KNOW PEOPLE INSIDE
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND ON TOP OF
THAT THEY GIVE THEM CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS.
SO IF KURTZ
WANTED TO MAKE A POINT, FOR
EXAMPLE LET'S TAKE A RANDOM
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, DIANE
FEINSTEIN -- QUICK QUIZ, WHO HAS
GOTTEN MORE MONEY FROM THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY,
MICHAEL COHEN OR DIANE
FEINSTEIN?
DIANE FEINSTEIN 
HAS
GOTTEN OVER $1 MILLION FROM THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY,
INCLUDING AT&T.
OH, BUT THAT'S
OKAY, THAT'S JUST A CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTION, OR INDEPENDENT
EXPENDITURE.
BY THE WAY, THAT
DOESN'T EVEN COUNT THE DARK
MONEY AND THE SUPER PACS.
IN
REALITY SHE ALONG WITH ALMOST
ALL THE OTHER SENATORS HAVE GOT
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BRIBES, I
MEAN INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES
AND CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, FROM
AT&T, THE TELECOMMUTE NEGATIONS
INDUSTRY, AND JUST ABOUT EVERY
OTHER INDUSTRY.
SO IS IT TRUE
THAT CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT IN
WASHINGTON?
ABSOLUTELY.
DOES IT
REALLY MATTER IF AT&T PAYS
MICHAEL COHEN OR UNITED STATES
SENATOR?
WHY ARE THEY PAYING
EITHER ONE?
BECAUSE THEY WANT
THEIR MERGER APPROVED AND THEY
WANT LOWER TAXES.
DOES ANYONE
THINK THEY ARE DOING IT FOR
THEIR HEALTH?
DOES ANYONE THINK
THEY ARE DOING IT FOR A
DIFFERENT REASON?
MICHAEL COHEN,
WE WOULD LIKE TO BE CORRUPT, BUT
DIANE FEINSTEIN, WE ARE DOING IT
FOR HEALTH.
WHEN IT COMES TO
FEINSTEIN AND ALL THE OTHER
SENATORS WE ARE DOING IT FOR
HEALTH AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN
CHARITY BUT MICHAEL COHEN,
THAT'S CORRUPTION.
DON'T GET ME
WRONG, MICHAEL COHEN, DEFINITELY
CORRUPT.
BUT SO IS PAYING ALL
THE SENATORS AND REPRESENTED US
AND BUYING THEM OFF.
SO NOW THAT
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS LAWYER GETS
CAUGHT, ALL OF A SUDDEN HOWARD
KURTZ IS LIKE, NOBODY IS SHOCKED
BY THIS, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S A
SWAMP.
REALLY, HOWARD, DOES
EVERYONE KNOW IT?
IS THAT WHY
YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT
FOR DECADES AND TV?
NO, YOU
NEVER TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPTION
OF THE SENATORS AND HOW MONEY
GIVEN BY CORPORATIONS IS TO
MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFIT AT OUR
EXPENSE, YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT
THAT.
DO OTHER PEOPLE ON CABLE
NEWS TALK ABOUT IT?
CNN?
NEVER.
MSNBC, THE SO-CALLED PROGRESSIVE
CABLE NEWS OUTLET, LAUGH ALONG
WITH ME, NEVER.
THEY SAY THE
HONORABLE GENTLEMAN FROM
CONNECTICUT AND CALIFORNIA, AND
THESE ARE ALL GOOD PEOPLE, THEY
ARE DEBATING IDEAS -- NO THEY
AREN'T. ARE GETTING LEGALLY
BRIBED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
SO
YES, IT IS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
AND THEY ARE ALL AS GUILTY OF
IT.
SO WAKE UP TO WHAT IS
HAPPENING, INCLUDING THE FACT
THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WON'T
COVER IT BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE
BRIBES GO TO TELEVISION ADS, AND
THEY ARE TELEVISION COMPANIES.
WOLF-PAC.COM, GO AND FIGHT
AND FIX THIS PROBLEM.
