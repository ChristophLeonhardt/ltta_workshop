GO AHEAD.
>> Reporter: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, AFTER I AM
FINISHED, IF ONE OF OUR FEMALE
COLLEAGUES TO GO AFTER ME, THAT
WOULD BE GREAT.
MR. PRESIDENT, JUST A FOLLOW-UP
ON THESE ALLEGATIONS --
>> President Trump: WHAT DOES
HE MEAN BY THAT?
EXPLAIN.
>> Reporter: FEMALE REPORTER.
>> President Trump: WHAT DOES
IT MEAN?
>> Reporter: THAT A FEMALE
REPORTER WOULD ASK YOU ABOUT
THIS ISSUE.
>> President Trump: I WOULDN'T
MIND THAT AT ALL.
IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
TO ME.
GO AHEAD.
>> Reporter: IF I COULD
FOLLOW-UP AND ON JOHN'S
QUESTION, WHY IS IT THAT YOU
ALWAYS SEEM TO SIDE WITH THE
ACCUSED AND NOT THE ACCUSER.
YOU HAVE THREE WOMEN HERE WHO
ARE ALL MAKING ALLEGATIONS, WHO
ARE ALL ASKING THAT THEIR
STORIES BE HEARD.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE OF
ROY MOORE.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE OF ONE
OF YOUR STAFFERS, YOU SEEM TO,
TIME AND AGAIN, SIDE WITH THE
ACCUSED ARE NOT THE ACCUSER.
IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE MANY
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU HAVE HAD
MADE AGAINST YOU?
>> President Trump: FIRST OF
ALL, I WASN'T HAPPY WITH
ROY MOORE.
LET'S GET THAT STRAIGHT.
ROY MOORE WAS A REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE, AND I WOULD HAVE
RATHER HAD A REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE.
I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH LUTHER
STRANGE, WHO IS A TERRIFIC MAN
FROM ALABAMA.
LUTHER STRANGE HAD A LOT OF
THINGS GOING AGAINST HIM.
AS FAR AS WOMEN, WHETHER IT'S A
MAN OR A WOMAN, THESE ARE, YOU
KNOW, IT CAN HAPPEN THE OTHER
WAY.
ALLEGATIONS CAN HAPPEN THE OTHER
WAY ALSO.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
WHETHER IT WAS A MAN OR WOMAN,
30 YEARS AGO, 36 YEARS AGO, IN
FACT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
MANY YEARS AGO BECAUSE NOBODY
KNOWS WHAT THE TIME IS.
THAT'S A LONG TIME.
I COULD PICK AS AN EXAMPLE,
HOPEFULLY I WON'T HAVE TO DO IT
AS A REPLACEMENT BECAUSE
HOPEFULLY THIS IS GOING TO GO
VERY WELL ON THURSDAY AND IT'S
GOING TO GO VERY WELL ON MONDAY
OR SATURDAY OR SUNDAY OR
WHENEVER THEY VOTE.
BUT I COULD PICK A WOMAN, AND
SHE COULD HAVE CHARGES MADE FROM
MANY YEARS AGO ALSO.
AND I WOULD LOOK AT THE
CHARACTER -- WHAT I HAVE TO
DO --
>> Reporter: RELUCTANT TO COME
FORWARD.
YOU'VE RAISED DOUBTS ABOUT THESE
ACCUSERS.
>> President Trump: I DON'T
THINK PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO
COME FORWARD.
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE
TO SPEAK.
THEY HAVE A MAJOR CHANCE TO
SPEAK, AND IT WILL BE TOMORROW,
I ASSUME.
WE HAVE DELAYED THIS, MEANING
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS, NOT ME.
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE
DELAYED THIS FOR WEEKS NOW.
THEY ARE GIVING THE WOMEN A
MAJOR CHANCE TO SPEAK.
IT'S POSSIBLE I WILL HEAR THAT
AND I WILL SAY HEY, I AM
CHANGING MY MIND.
THAT IS POSSIBLE.
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO
SPEAK.
AND THEY ARE GIVEN --
>> Reporter: TO THINK ALL
THREE SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE?
>> President Trump: WHOEVER IS
GIVEN A CHANCE.
WE HAVE DELETED A LONG TIME.
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG
SHOT AT SPEAKING AND MAKING
THEIR CASE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I COULD BE
PERSUADED ALSO.
YES, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.
YES, GO AHEAD PLEASE.
>> Reporter: THANK YOU,
MR. PRESIDENT.
A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP
ON SOME ANSWERS I DIDN'T QUITE
HEAR FROM YOU, IF YOU WOULD
ALLOW ME A COUPLE QUESTIONS.
FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK THESE
WOMEN, ALL THREE OF THEM, ARE
LIARS?
>> President Trump: HAVE THEY
BEEN WATCH?
>> Reporter: HAVE THEY BEEN
LIARS?
>> President Trump: I CAN'T
TELL YOU.
I HAVE TO LISTEN TOMORROW.
I CAN TELL YOU HER LAWYER IS A
LOW LIFE.
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT
THEY ARE LIARS UNTIL I HEAR
THEM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY
WITH JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA
AND SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS
YOU KNOW.
AND I CHAIRED THE SECURITY
COUNCIL.
SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TODAY'S
PERSON THAT CAME FORWARD.
I DO KNOW ABOUT THE LAWYER.
YOU DON'T GET MUCH WORSE.
BAD REPUTATION.
TAKE A LOOK AT HIS PAST.
AS FAR AS THE OTHER WOMEN ARE
CONCERNED, I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS TOMORROW.
I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I'M GOING TO
SEE WHAT IS SAID.
IT'S POSSIBLE THEY WILL BE
CONVINCING.
NOW, WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID,
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN,
FOR MANY YEARS, ONE OF THE MOST
RESPECTED PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON.
HE'S BEEN ON, I GUESS YOU'D CALL
IT THE SECOND HIGHEST COURT.
EVERY SINGLE PERSON KNOWS HIM.
A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW HIM WELL.
AND THOSE PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE
WHAT'S GOING ON.
I CAN ALWAYS BE CONVINCED.
I HAVE TO HEAR IT.
>> Reporter: IT SOUNDS LIKE
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THERE IS
A SCENARIO UNDER WHICH YOU WOULD
WITHDRAW BRETT KAVANAUGH'S
NOMINATION.
IS THAT CORRECT >> President
Trump: IF I THOUGHT HE WAS
GUILTY OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
SURE.
>> Reporter: AND YOU WILL WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW TO MAKE UP YOUR
MIND.
>> President Trump: I WILL
WATCH.
I HOPE I CAN SEE.
I WILL BE MEETING WITH A LOT OF
COUNTRIES TOMORROW BUT I AM
HOPING TO WASH.
I'M RELYING ON VERY FAIR AND
TALENTED REPUBLICAN SENATORS.
IF WE BROUGHT GEORGE WASHINGTON
HERE AND WE SAID WE HAVE
GEORGE WASHINGTON, THE DEMOCRATS
WOULD VOTE AGAINST HIM, JUST SO
YOU UNDERSTAND.
HE MAY HAVE HAD A BAD PASS.
WHO KNOWS?
HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME I THINK
ACCUSATIONS MADE.
DIDN'T HE HAVE A COUPLE THINGS
IN HIS PAST?
GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD BE VOTED
AGAINST 100% BY SCHUMER AND THE
CON ARTIST.
100%.
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER FROM
THIS.
WHEN JOHN ASKED ABOUT THE FBI,
IF THE FBI DID THE MOST THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION IN THE HISTORY OF
THE FBI THEY FOUND IT TO BE 100%
PERFECT, HE WOULD LOSE EVERY
SINGLE VOTE.
IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN BACK
TOMORROW, I THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO GET SOME QUOTES FROM THE
DEMOCRATS.
YOU KNOW WHY?
WE ALL KNOW WHY.
IT'S CALLED POLITICS.
THEN YOU'LL PROBABLY GET SOME
VOTES.
ONE MORE QUESTION.
SHE SAYS -- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK
THREE QUESTIONS.
NOT REALLY FAIR TO EVERYONE
ELSE.
SHOULD I LET HER ASK ANOTHER
QUESTION?
GO AHEAD.
SEE?
>> Reporter: FOLLOWING UP,
THAT YOU HAD GIVEN THE BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT TO ALL MEN.
HAS THERE EVER BEEN AN INSTANCE
WHEN YOU'VE GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF
THE DOUBT --
>> President Trump: I'VE KNOWN
THEM FOR A LONG TIME, A LOT OF
THESE PEOPLE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE.
SOME I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED
WITH.
I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH
SOME OTHERS, THERE ARE CHARGES
THAT ARE PRETTY WEAK, BUT I'VE
KNOWN PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME.
I NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING
WRONG.
I NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING
WRONG.
THERE ARE SOME THAT PROBABLY I
AGREE.
I CAN TELL YOU I AGREE THERE ARE
SOME THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING FOR
A LONG TIME.
IN A COUPLE CASES, THEY WORKED
REPUBLICANS.
IN A LOT OF CASES THEY WERE NOT.
THEY WERE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE
