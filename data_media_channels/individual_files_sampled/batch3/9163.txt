LADY, HA ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENED TO YOU? , WATCH. IT'S OPEN. IT'S OPEN. I DON'T GO ON DATES WITH GUYS THAT DON'T OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME. REALLY? YES. SERIOUSLY? YES. OH, MAN. NO HE AINSLEY: WELL, ACCORDING TO A RECENT SURVEY BY MATCH.COM, 73% OF WOMEN BELIEVE CHIVALRY IS DEAD. ACCORDING TO ONE OF OUR NEXT GUESTS, EXPLAINS IN THE NEW OP-ED, BECAUSE WOMEN KILLED IT. SUZANNE BAKER A COLUMNIST, AUTHOR OF GUIDE TO MARRIAGE. WE HAVE A PROFESSOR AT JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY TO DISCUSS IT AND A DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST. GOOD MORNING, LADIES. GOOD MORNING. SUZANNE, YOU WROTE THE OP SET. WENDY, YOU READ IT, I READ IT. YOU COMPARE A TELEGRAM THAT WAS SENT TO A WOMAN RIGHT BEFORE SHE GOT MARID TO A FACEBOOK VIDEO. I READ BACK IN THE DAY, BACK IN 1954, YOUR FRIEND, HER PERIOD OF TIME RECENTLY DIED, YOUR FRIEND WAS GOING THROUGH MEMORABILIA. SHE FINDS THE TELEGRAM. THIS IS THE HUSBAND WRITING TO HIS SOON TO BE WIFE. DARLINGLYING I WILL WAIT FOR YOU AT 8:00, WITH A LIFETIME OF EXPECTANCY. MY HEART COMING DOWN WITH THE AISLE. MAY GOD BE WITH US TONIGHT. MY LOVE FOR YOU, HENRY. SUZANNE YOU SAW ON FACEBOOK THIS VIDEO SAYING CHIVALRY WAS HARMFUL TO MEN AND WOMEN BECAUSE IT REINFORCES THIS IDEA THAT WOMEN NEED TO BE HELPED OR SAVED BY A STRONGER MAN, IT TAKES AWAY FROM WOMAN'S AGENCY. YOU SAW THESE TWO CONTRASTS. YOU STARTED TO WRITE THE OP-ED, EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE FOR US. SURE. IT JUST STRUCK ME AS JUST WOW, I MEAN THE STARK CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS BEAUTIFUL LETTER THAT REALLY MOVED ME TO SEEING THIS MESSAGE FROM THIS WOMAN, BASICALLY SELLING THE SAME TIRED MESSAGE THAT MEN HAVE BEEN HEARING FOR DECADE WHICH IS, I CAN DO IT BY MYSELF. I'M STRONG ENOUGH. YOU DON'T NEED TO HOLD THE DOOR OPEN FOR ME. YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY MY WAY. BASICALLY ANYTHING THAT IS SORT OF TRADITIONALLY MALE AND FEMALE IN TERMS OF THE COURTSHIP IS JUST GONE. AFTER SOME YEARS OF HEARING THAT, MY ARGUMENT IS THAT MEN HAVE EFFECTIVELY SAID, OKAY, YOU SAID YOU DON'T WANT IT, SO I GUESS I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT. IF I DO IT I WILL BE INSULTED. THEY ARE REALLY LOST AND CONFUSE WHAT WOMEN WANT. WOMEN ARE JUST AS CONFUSED BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD THIS MESSAGE THAT, THAT CHIVALRY IS BAD OR SOMEHOW DESTRUCTIVE TO WOMEN IT IS NOT AT ALL. SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM. AINSLEY: WENDY, WHAT DO YOU THINK? ARE WE TO BLAME, WOMEN. I WOULDN'T GO AS FAR TO SAY WOMEN KILLED CHIVALRY. WHETHER YOU LOOK FROM CARD DID I. ABOUT, TO BEYONCE,WORKING MOMS OR COUNTLESS OTHERS WHAT WE HAVE DONE WE EVOLVED THE CONVERSATION WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A WOMAN IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS, WE'RE DOING IT ALL, AND IT IS BASICALLY MEAN MEN HAVE TO BASICALLY RISE TO THE OCCASION TO MEET US WHERE WE ARE. WE ARE NOT THE MOTHERS OF OUR PAST. THERE WAS FOG WRONG WITH THAT PAST NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT WE'RE DOING JUGGLING MILLIONS OF THINGS. CHIVALRY IS NOT DEAD, IN ESSENCE WE DON'T WANT MEN TO OPEN DOORS FOR US, WHAT WE ARE SAYING WE HAVE TO HANDLE US AND HANDLE A FULL-TIME JOB AS WELL. AINSLEY: YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT IN THE OP-ED, SUZANNE, NOT THAT WE CAN'T OPEN OUR OWN DOORS, TO THE THAT WE CAN'T PAY FOR OUR OWN FOOD, BUT YOU SAY THAT, IS IT, IS THIS SHOW OF SIGN OF RESPECT? WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO LET A WOMAN DO THOSE THING? RIGHT. SO WHAT'S BEEN LOST IN THIS WHOLE, 40-YEAR EXPERIMENT REALLY OR, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DEFINE IT IS THE YIN AND YANG THE DANCE BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN. MEN AND WOMEN NOW ARE COMPLETELY CONFUSED AND LOST ABOUT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT. WHO WANTS WHAT AND WHAT WOMEN SPECIFICALLY ARE CONFUSED ABOUT, IS MEN AND HOW THEIR, IT IS IN THEIR DNA TO PROVIDE AND PROTECT WOMEN. THAT IS WHO THEY ARE. THAT IS THEIR IDENTITY. WE'VE ESSENTIALLY RIPPED OUT OF THEM. WHEN THEY BECOME UNMOORED. IF YOU DON'T LET THEM DO WHAT IS IN THEM TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO DISRUPT THAT DANCE. SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS, MASCULINITY AND FEMINITY ARE WONDERFUL THINGS IN AND OFF THEMSELVES, WHEN THEY WORK IN TANDEM, SPARKS FLY. IT IS AWESOME. WE'RE NOT ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN PAUSE WE ARE INFUSED WITH THIS MESSAGE ABOUT EQUALITY, THE IDEA MEN AND WOMEN ARE THE SAME WHEN THEY ARE NOT. THAT GESTURE OF HOLDING THE DOOR OPEN I WAS USING AS ONE EXAMPLE IS TO THE MEN TRYING TO OPEN PRESS WOMEN. THEY WANT TO PLEASE THEM. THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. THEY WANT TO SHOW THEM HONOR REALLY. WE KNEW THIS IN THE PAST. EVERYBODY KNEW THIS THIS HAS GOTTEN COMPLETELY LOST IN THE LAST 40 YEARS. YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE TELEGRAM HOW DEEPLY THAT WAS FELT AND UNDERSTOOD. WOMEN TODAY WANT. YOU READ AT THAT TELEGRAM. WHO WOULD TO THE WANT THAT, RIGHT? BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE, YEAH, GOT TO GET BACK TO UNDERSTANDING AINSLEY: WENDY, WE'RE ALL, I HEARD IT SAID THAT WE ARE CREATED THE, WE ARE BOTH EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT BUT CREATED THE DIFFERENTLY IN OUR NEEDS AND OUR WANTS. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? I AGREE WITH THAT TO SOME EXTENT. AS A WIFE AND MOTHER OF TWO LITTLE BOYS I BELIEVE THE STRENGTH OF A WOMAN WHAT MAKES MEN RESPECT US EVEN MORE. WE ARE TO THE NECESSARILY DAMSELS IN DISTRESS HERE. WE CAN OPEN DOORS FOR OURSELVES IS. WE CAN DO THINGS FOR OURSELVES. WE WELCOME MEN TO OPEN DOORS FOR US AS WELL. BUT ITS OKAY FOR A WOMAN TO BE STRONG. IT IS OKAY FOR A WOMEN TO BE INDEPENDENT. THAT IN NO WAY NEGATES A MAN'S MASCULINITY AT ALL. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
