a Mexican citizen has earned the ability to visit the United States in order to attend her son's funeral her son was actually a person who was protected under daca and drove a hundred miles to the Houston area in order to help volunteer in saving victims of Hurricane Harvey now unfortunately while he was volunteering the boat that he was on capsized and he did drown and it's really a tragic story so that's 31 year old Alonzo Guillen and he came to the country when he was just a teenager and he was protected under daca however about 48 hours prior to Trump announcing that he would end daca he was found dead and it's just a tragic story so Green was born in Piedras Negras Mexico area and he moved to the United States under the shelter of daca he has been living in Texas ever since he was a teenager now just to give you an idea of what exactly happened when their boat capsized they were on their way to an apartment complex near the interstate 45 in Beltway 8 when the hurricane struck the bridge over the creek that capsized Wednesday search crews went looking for Alonso after they went missing his body was discovered on Friday and to make the story even more tragic people who discovered his body were his family members they suspected the area that he would be found in and they kept their eye on the murky waters in that area and his body did wash up and they found him so his mother did want to come to the United States to visit and to of course attend his funeral but she was initially rejected by Border Patrol agents and after this story became a huge national story luckily the US government did give her permission to come and go to the funeral so Alonso as with almost every dreamer was employed and this was not necessarily his fight and he lives in Texas but a hundred miles away and because he's an incredible guy decided hey look I'm gonna go get a boat these guys are flooded and they need help and he went to go help and you know when when we saw those pictures I think all Americans and it didn't matter what your politics were were moved by whether it was police or firefighters or just regular citizens going to help those people to make sure they didn't try and remember the little old ladies stuck in the nursing home with the water all the way up and and they were desperate for help and people came in help them and the laws was one of those guys and he died doing so and if he had stayed alive in about six months Donald Trump would have deported him so now you can say oh you don't know that with perfect precision because he might not have had his status beat up turned within the six-month period and if he just might have been deported a little past do you think that's relevant yeah you think that's the relevant part of the story and who knows maybe Congress for once in their lives would actually do something positive and and vote on some sort of immigration reform that would help that's the argument that I'm seeing from a lot of Trump supporters well he's not supporting people right now I mean he's giving Congress that six month period yeah because Congress has been really great in in passing any type of legislation or agreeing on any type of policy yeah and they say oh well no Obama did wrong where you can't do anything on immigration with executive orders that's why well the first thing is Donald Trump did was ban Muslims from certain countries by executive order on an issue of immigration so it is not about the rule of law it's not about being consistent it's that they don't like guys like Alonso again and it's not based on whether they're employed whether they're part of the economy the federal government gets 60 billion dollars from dreamers they contribute over two hundred and fifteen billion dollars to the GDP and that's according to a right-wing think-tank Cato Institute so it's not about the money and they pay all their taxes it's not about their bums because they're all gainfully employed almost all the 97% either in school or have jobs including the military some of them are business owners some of them provide jobs yes and it's not that they're not good enough as you saw perfectly good enough people so what is it about you know what it's about they're they're the them they're the others and we have to protect us right and us is unfortunately for Trump and his supporters at racial construct so they don't care how good a person Lazo was they had targeted him and they would have kicked him out well they don't have to I guess now and luckily some there was still a human being left in the federal government who let his mom in after they initially rejected her humanitarian visa so she'll get the attendance funeral watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded or stream it watch it anyway you like a TYT Network comm /join
