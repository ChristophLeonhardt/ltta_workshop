happy Monday kanye west is having an extended normal one so many times i talked to like a white person about this missing have to fight trough these races well not about racism on America here's Kanye admitting that Trump is in fact racist but so is everyone in America is this what we're doing now if you if you can't beat him you join him is Kanye's answer to the KKK putting on the robe couple months ago I wrote four articles when I found out I had been red pill by watching Candace owns videos and Charlie Kirk because as a fan I was distraught a caution that this was normal for a and that he was simply marketing albeit in a really crappy way that helps people like Charlie Kirk and Donald Trump and now he's back saying dumb on national television suspiciously right before his new album comes out to take their fathers at the home promote welfare Thank You Kayne very cool this idea that Democrats created welfare to the short of black community isn't a new one the idea is that welfare was created to increase the number of single-parent households in the black community except yay if you're looking for a reason for a single black parenthood why wouldn't you look at your personal experience and maybe some data data that points to the criminalization of black father's rather than welfare after all more white people benefit from welfare but they surprisingly aren't impacted by its magical powers of ensuring single parenthood but that's the point a lot of people lack critical thinking skills and when they get pushback on these ideas they're then dude it's not bullying if people are giving you sound advice because they want to make sure you don't sound like an absolute moron on TV and they say I'm in a second place you want to see the second place okay hi yes the famous Superman cape worn by all sorts of super men who like to do super things like Locke immigrant children and cages this means you can't tell me what to do stop following your mind that's how we're control that's how we're programmed yes except when you follow to your heart and not your brain you arrived at slavery as a choice and that we should abolish the 13th amendment the amendment that abolished slavery or maybe he was referring to the exception clause that allowed slavery to continue inside a prisons which he clarified was the case after being dumped down by the internet for being stupid or you know in Kanye's words being bullied but that's the point if you think people are trying to correct the irresponsible narrative you're repeating is bullying then you're not interested in learning new things Kanye look it's not surprising that you identify with a vicious narcissistic self-promoter like Donald Trump I'm not gonna sit here and act like I'm not amazed by how well he can captivate hordes of people but this idea that we're going at the president's neck is ridiculous we live in a constant state of fear where we seemingly have to beg those in power every single week not to take away our healthcare or push for a common-sense gun control or investigate whether or not a SCOTUS nominee sexually assaulted women how can you sit here and demand that we sit quietly as all of this happens to your fellow Americans yay I know that these words won't mean much but hopefully you can change some people's minds so please share this video with your friends and don't forget to leave your thoughts in the comment section below also please support TYT by joining TYT membership at TYT dot-com /join and this has been the breakdown did you know that tid network is now available on youtubes new streaming platform YouTube TV get access to full TYT episodes and exclusive shows by signing up for youtube TV today all new subscribers get a 7 day free trial so head on over to youtube TV and search for the TYT Network Channel
