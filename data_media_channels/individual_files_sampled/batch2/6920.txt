now Republicans love to sit there's nothing we can do about gun control man I mean all these mass shootings these massacres the largest one in modern history happened yesterday in Las Vegas 59 killer than the night before 59 killed over 500 injured and the Republicans answer to it I don't know why because they get paid by the NRA to not do anything so they're deeply corrupt and they don't mind playing with your lives so but they can't say that so what are they going to say mental illness but now do we know if this guy was mentally ill or not that this matter does matter that's our standard excuse but you're gonna want to wait to see what the reality is first they asked the Paul Ryan hey are you gonna do anything about this I mean when one person dies from terrorism in the country that is really important we all go to do something about it and Paul Ryan and Trump 159 people died down I'm gonna do anything about it but they've got their standard issue so go ahead Paul what's your Excuse yeah I think one of the UM one of the things we've learned from these shootings is that often underneath this is a diagnosis of mental illness this is why we spent years working on mental illness with reform a congressman Murphy's bill and that's why the House Representative passed landmark mental health reform just a year ago that law is now being implemented so I think it's important that as we see the dust settle and we see what was behind some of these tragedies that mental health reform is a critical ingredient to making sure that we can try and prevent some of these things from happening in the past so that's just one example of the things that Congress has done to make sure that we can try and get ahead of these problems don't do anything about guns okay the guy had 23 guns and at the hotel yet 19 at home but don't do anything about guns did he kill people with mental health no he killed him with guns and bullets but don't do it anyway but that's okay let's pretend to do something about mental health but wait a minute I thought there was a bill about mental health and that you actually prevented people having their guns taken away if they have mental health issues well let's because a couple of reporters are gonna ask him watch yep but Nicholson there were people who were whose rights were being infringed and that wasn't just it was it's a little more complicated than you then your describe protecting people's rights was was very important and that's what that that issue was all about so wait you said that the one thing you were doing about this was to make sure that we do something about mental health reform and then they reporters pointed out no UFC made it easier for people who are mentally ill to get guns there's a guy that's complicated complicated no no so you were just you did the exact opposite of what your only excuse is your exclusive mental health so let me go back to earlier this here go to NBC News and show you what actually happened back then this was in February President Donald Trump they explained quietly signed a bill into law Tuesday rolling back an Obama era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to purchase a gun so Obama had made it harder for people with mental illness serious serious mental illness to purchase a gun Trump rolled it back Paul Ryan the House the Senate helped in the role of anga mentally ill people they should get guns here I'll give you more details the rule which was finalized in December added people receiving Social Security checks for mental illnesses and people deemed unfit to handle their own financial affairs to the national background check database so I'll give you further clarity on that so they said look we've got this database where you need to do a check and if somebody's got issues and you know are the NRA is whittle that database now if you're on a terrorist watchlist you could still buy a gun in America the degree of insanity of that is unimaginable gee if there's nothing we could do don't let the guys on the terrorist watchlist have a gun no they got rights terrorists have rights that's Republicans protecting terrorists rights well some people on the list sir are not exactly right sometimes there's maybe up to three percent could be wrong how 97% that are right how about you fixed the 3% instead of saying let all the terrorists have guns but in this case about mental illness they're number one excuse and this is for a category people that are getting Social Security but they cannot that they have been adjudicated to be so mentally ill that you can't trust them with their own money they need someone to handle their financial affairs for them so you can't even give them a Social Security check the Republicans said and passed a law saying even though they're not mentally fit to handle a single dollar we want them to be able to buy guns and then you have the nerve to go out on a press conference and say we should do anything about guns but we should do something about mental health those are some times and it's it's not a judgment on them just who they are and and we I want to have more mental health reform to help those folks but you think a guy who can't be trusted with a single dollar the government has adjudicated it their family of friends have asked don't give him a dollar he doesn't know how to spend it get him a gun get my gun no no these guys they're so corrupt it's not that they're just I mean it's not like it's easy to joke around and say well they're mentally ill they're not they're not they're just corrupt and they don't care about your lives as long as they got their eye on our NRA check they don't give a damn about you and your loved ones if you get shot by someone who's mentally ill take her whatever let's go to our steak dinner here I'm gonna give you more details both the House and Senate last week passed a new bill HJ resolution 40 revoking the Obama era regulation Trump signed the bill into law without a photo-op or fanfare on the same day back in February he actually did huge photo off four other bills at Eastside and other executive orders that he signed but when he came to that uh they put it in a footnote why cuz they know that what they did was important they know they did it for the NRA checks so they didn't want a photo-op of Trump signing that because they know that the next time somebody who's mentally ill shoots someone people hey wait a minute didn't you want the mentally ill to have guns and so they don't want a photo op that they have no conscience whatsoever at the time one last quote from NBC News the National Rifle Association quote applauded Trump's action I wonder if they're still applauding so the next time you see a Republican out there or a Democrat who is also funded and bribed by the NRA talking about how there's nothing we can do oh the real issues mental health know that they are lying through their teeth they are the swamp they are the corrupted they just took the money and they said yes we don't care how mentally ill you are we don't even care if you're a terrorist as long as our gun manufacturers that pay our campaign donations are making money off of your death you have at it Hoss give them the guns give them whatever they're mentally ill or terrorists and if they kill you or your loved ones we don't care as long as we cash the check that's who Paul Ryan is help us build an independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
