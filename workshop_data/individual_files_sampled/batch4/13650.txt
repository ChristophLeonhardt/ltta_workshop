President Trump was at the UN yesterday he's at the UN today as well he's presiding over the Security Council and it is in fact deeply amusing to watch him gavel to silence the constituencies the representatives of China for example he's actually sitting there with a gavel which is pretty awesome but he gave a speech at the UN General Assembly yesterday and it was quite good there was a lot there that was quite good he said that we defend sovereignty this was his sort of main claim I think that this particular claim is not one of his best and he says we defend sovereignty of other nations and then he sort of suggests that they get to define their own values that's true to a point obviously it is not true to the ultimate point which is that you get to define how you treat your people without any sort of interference from the outside that obviously is untrue but here was the president making his main point talking about America first and sovereignty to unleash this incredible potential in our people we must defend the foundations that make it all possible sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived democracy has ever endured where peace has ever prospered and so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all so I agree with all of that right everything that he just said there about nationalism actually being a good vehicle everything there about nationalism being a good vehicle for for human society agree and the idea of a global government where were all brothers a brotherhood of man as John Lennon says an imagined as a bunch of nonsense with that said even Trump believes that nationalism doesn't mean that that sovereignty is completely is completely left alone right so for example he said this about socialism in communism he basically said Venezuela can't run things like the Venezuelan government is currently running things that's a breach of Venezuelan sovereignty I would imagine the basic rule about Venezuela and the basic rule about nationalism is the nationalism is good so long as it follows good follows good ends and uses good means it is not good so long as it involves you know genocide against a population or so long as it involves socialism and communism the destruction of the rights of the individual here is a president Trump going off about Venezuela he's correct about this obviously virtually every socialism or communism has been tried it has produced suffering corruption and decay socialism's thirst for power leads to expansion incursion and oppression all nations of the world should resist socialism and the misery that it brings to everyone in that spirit we ask the nations gathered here to join us in calling for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela okay so obviously when he talks about sovereignty he only means the taverns he applies so far as it doesn't violate sovereign human rights and individual rights which is correct which is correct and I think that he should make that clear in future speeches but a lot of this was very good and it is good to have a president who goes before the UN and doesn't make apologies for the United States I mean when I think President Trump is at his best in international scenarios because a muscular America on the world stage defending her own interests is a very good thing for the world as a general rule a America that goes in front of the UN and apologizes for Ferguson or Baltimore which is what Barack Obama did in front of the UN apologizes for American interests apologizes for America promoting her own interests around the world suggesting that national sovereignty of bad countries is more important than human rights or national sovereignty of good countries now that was devastating stuff and I know there a lot of people say well you know President Trump went there he got laughed at by the international community why do you care if a second-rate dictator is laughing at you so long as we're taking action to stop the second-rate dictator I would much prefer that the second-rate radical Islamic dictators of Iran laugh at President Trump and feel it in their pocketbook then they smile at President Obama and enrich themselves on the back of their own people and then use all of that money to fund terrorism so President Trump I thought did a just fine job at the UN in the General Assembly yesterday the the best I mean the way that he talked about Israel and Iran I thought was just terrific you know here's what the president said with regard to with regard to Iran there's very different language than President Obama was using just a couple of years ago this year we also took another significant step forward in the Middle East in recognition of every sovereign state to determine its own capital I move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem the United States is committed to a future of peace and stability in the region including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians that aim is advanced not harmed by acknowledging the obvious facts okay and then what he had to say about the Israelis and Palestinians obviously a far cry for when Barack Obama would go to the UN and suggest that all world problems were to be laid at the feet of the Jews there would be laid at the feet of the Israelis who are of course so intransigent with regards who you know the terrorist groups on their borders and if they would only be a little nicer that would solve the problems with regard to Iran I do like that the president's America first attitude on the world stage means that we're going to stand up to bad countries again he was doing that today in the in the Security Council apparently he said today in the Security Council that China has been attempting to interfere with our elections he suggested that Russian interference in Syria cannot go unnoticed you know all of that is is very good stuff so good for the President of the United States more of that more of the president speaking on international affairs in the face of countries that are pursuing evil ends and you know less of the president tweeting I think the last several weeks for the president have actually been quite good he's really kept himself from saying the the obviously dumb thing much more frequently than than usual and that would be good I'd like to see a continuation of that
