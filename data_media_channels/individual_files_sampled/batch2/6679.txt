there's no need for Donald Trump to pardon himself I know that because I Donald Trump's been tweeting it all week okay but wherefore we get to that let's find out if maybe there is some issue with Russia because I'm led to believe by someone a lot of people on the right some on the left no evidence of Russian meddling at all there's no evidence really last week at the Aspen Security Forum for of Donald Trump's top intelligence and national security officials including Mike Pompeo the CIA director said they were absolutely convinced that the Russians were behind an effort to influence the election that is not someone from the Obama administration that is not a Democrat that is a super hardcore right winger appointed by Donald Trump saying absolutely convinced that the Russians meddled well let's go Dan coach he's a National Intelligence director that puts all those agencies together named Dan coach is there any dissent at all on whether Russia meddle in the elections quote there is no dissent but yeah but what why do you think they're doing in an is this but it's just over height you know not a big deal quote they are trying to undermine Western democracy that seems like kind of a big deal okay so if you're still in the camp of like jojo's all made up by Democrats weird that some of the most virulent right-wingers in the country who are appointed by Trump have joined in that analysis hmm it's almost as if the intelligence agencies do have evidence Joe but they didn't share all that other this publicly maybe the Republicans and Democrats have decided randomly to make everything up and and and just yeah maybe well if you're not concerned by it you're apparently alone because the Trump is so he then tweets out it's very sad the Republicans even some of some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their president okay so in other words come on guys we've got my back here the guy's a appointed does say chances recuse himself I'm thinking of finest Oh bitches job was to cover up my crimes and then now Dan coach of Mike Pompeo they all say the Russians medal to the lights god damn it I gotta talk about pardons then he says while all agreed the US president has the complete power to pardon why think of that when only crimes so far as leaks against us fake news but dude nobody was talking about pardons until you said it so I guess he's thinking of partying so said that like remember guys I mean even even if I am super guilty of helping the Russians medal in this election I can pardon myself that's not a winning argument but he's too stupid to realize that the only reason to treat does be look I mean this is always the time I just pardon myself man you know what I'm saying idiot why did you bring that up you're so stupid okay but that's okay his lawyer Jay Sekulow says pardons are not on the table well curious the president brought up okay now let's find out if pardons are on the table now we next go to seculow again pardons are not on table let's watch I want to be clear on this George we have not and continue to not have conversations with the President of the United States regarding pardons pardons have not been discussed and pardons are not on the table we're not researching the issue because the issue of Barnes is not on the table there's nothing important from okay how can you here we have the court actually then we go to a graphic 14 here we have this from that thing you just saw we have not and I continue to not have conversations with the President of the United States about pardons how do you continue not to have a conversation like we're not talking about parts I mean I don't know who brought up words the president okay I don't know but that's why I continued to not have a conversations about pardons with the president if you say so brother now let's go to the new communications director scrum uchi so I'm sure the mooches he's known will clarify all this let's watch okay he's talking about pardoning partner Jake let's cut through it all okay you let you and I right here let's go you're basically saying that that tweet is suggesting that the president's gonna pardon himself and every one of his family members what are you suggesting I'm saying he's not he's not gonna do that I am suggesting one thing the president tweeted about parties and I'm asking you who's he thinking about pardoning that's all kinda Justin there's a while the president's thinking about pardoning nobody because it has been coming up a lot there's an undercurrent of nonsensical stuff because he has advisors about it there's the undercurrent of does settle stuff that you brought up president tweeted about it it's exactly I mean I could pardon me well the president has complete power to pardon people but who's bringing up this nonsense who is it who is it I want names so who you know I don't know why you're bringing it up Jake all right finally back to Jay Sekulow Trump's lawyer clearly the Constitution does vest a plenary pardon power within the president's wait I thought you guys were not having a conversation about it that seems like scrum uchi kind of admitted that they were having conversations about it and you just admitted that you were having conversations about it and you just double down on what President Trump said now remember everybody I mean he can't pardon anyone he wants including the president now whether you can actually do that as a different question he says which if you're already trying to pardon yourself from horrific crimes committed against the American people there's a decent chance you're going to get impeached so just keep that in mind so oh dammit why didn't anybody tell me about it me impeachment you know the president has the style power to stop at a beach mitt actually no you don't you don't have that power dude I don't know why is anybody freeing up this nonsense he hasn't said that part about the impeachment yet hold-hold so obviously they're worried that it's so bad that President Trump might have to pardon himself for his own crimes before they lock him up lock him up forget the presidency he's worried about crimes that he could be charged with damn support independent media come join us to the Young Turks TYT Network calm / join
