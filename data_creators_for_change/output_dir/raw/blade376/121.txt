00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off with a metaphor now</font>

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,009
if you can imagine an iceberg and if you

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,170
can't imagine it here's a picture now

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,540
above the water represents the Occupy

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,639
movements around the world which are

visible to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainstream media the</font>

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,650
tents the people and the lazy ones that

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,600
need to go get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a job but below the water</font>

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,449
is a huge mass of people who can't go

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,970
out on the streets and protest but who

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,859
still believe in the issues that are

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">being addressed who perhaps still have a</font>

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,630
home family<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or a job and who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,969
social networks to support those out on

the street I mean those under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the water</font>

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
represent people who are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of a</font>

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,329
global consciousness one which the

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,820
traditional mainstream media don't seem

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,980
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> media is</font>

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,329
something that's only become prominent

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,579
in society the past five years it's

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">still early days and in some ways this</font>

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,629
has created a mass divided between

24
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,370
generations i could divide the

25
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,289
generations into three groups the first

26
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,480
group the oldest are people that were

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,190
not born with internet and weren't

28
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,800
brought up with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second generation</font>

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,030
people that weren't born with internet

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,220
but learnt it in later life and then you

31
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,570
have the third and youngest generation

32
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,270
whose whole life experiences have been

33
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,369
enriched with internet access the

34
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,110
internet is certainly bringing the world

35
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,240
together something I talk about in my

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,310
out of sight out of mind video feel free

37
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to check out but I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

38
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,659
traditional mainstream media which quite

39
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,150
frankly is a sinking ship fighting for

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,400
survival just like traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,799
and just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> traditional politics in my</font>

video Occupy Wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> Street and mainstream</font>

43
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,479
media I tell people to ignore it because

44
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,689
it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicle of propaganda one area</font>

45
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,909
in which both business and politics mix

46
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,740
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> since then I've realized that</font>

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,390
actually we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach out through</font>

48
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,130
these mediums because the vast majority

49
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,439
of the general population<font color="#E5E5E5"> still use</font>

50
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,090
traditional media for reasons I've

51
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,549
already explained and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people they</font>

52
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,220
get spoon-fed what to think not told to

53
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,200
think for themselves if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was still</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">world right now I would so hope that</font>

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">song was out there looking for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,890
seriously so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about time we</font>

59
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,469
fight back using<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge truth and</font>

60
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,709
integrity and passion if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

61
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're probably asking how well firstly</font>

62
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,340
i can tell you

63
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,480
if you're watching this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,970
you probably understand online community

65
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,000
better than most traditional mainstream

66
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,989
journalists and just to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an</font>

67
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:23,989
example in 2008 i was on a BBC reality

TV show called<font color="#CCCCCC"> upstage it was run by</font>

Endemol who do big brother and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've put</font>

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,010
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> a team who ended up beating</font>

71
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,500
each of the acts on the show by over

72
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,660
eight times<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vote and the producers</font>

73
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,760
would grab me after each show and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me</font>

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,400
miles how did you do this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">just didn't understand and over the</font>

years I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> through many traditional</font>

the same thing again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

79
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,390
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a go at them it's been five</font>

80
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">years that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> social media has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> become so</font>

81
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,049
prominent and that's quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

82
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,940
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> required for any traditional</font>

83
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,160
mediums to evolve with the times and yes

media<font color="#E5E5E5"> colors information with their</font>

85
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,360
agenda but<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking news seems to be the</font>

86
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,799
big thing now because they're having to

87
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,140
compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> with social media where people</font>

88
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,940
can tweet news or live stream it

89
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,310
instantly and so they're now stepping

90
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,739
into our territory which makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot</font>

91
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,750
harder for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to censor things so</font>

92
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,519
let's take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this here are</font>

93
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:18,290
three tips I have for you right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

94
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,900
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one radio stations if you have a</font>

95
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">chance to phone up a radio station and</font>

96
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,350
contribute to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation whether</font>

97
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,079
it's talk radio or some other show do it

98
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,660
take every opportunity you can because

99
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,639
that is a chance to broadcast ideas and

100
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,010
wake people up but make sure when you

101
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,810
cool the radio station and you get put

102
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,370
through to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the producer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're not</font>

103
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">too heavy with what you want to talk</font>

104
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">about you know you let them feel</font>

105
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,040
comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with letting you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on air and</font>

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
then when that happens you can push the

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,269
conversation in your direction and an

108
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,579
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this was when i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LBC</font>

harsh questioning without dealing with

<font color="#E5E5E5">to counteract any criticisms they throw</font>

141
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,030
you away for example if a news reporter

142
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,370
says well it's clear here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protesters</font>

143
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,870
aren't really saying anything are they

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,360
don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well we are saying</font>

145
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,639
something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is it instead or in</font>

146
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,639
addition to that say and this is a clear

147
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,250
example of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of touch traditional</font>

148
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,260
mainstream media is you know show them

149
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,930
up make them accountable also in

150
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,850
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that why not research into</font>

151

<font color="#CCCCCC">the backgrounds of the Institute's that</font>

152
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenged us like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how BBC employed the</font>
