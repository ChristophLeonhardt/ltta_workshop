take a look at this shirt Walmart was forced to remove from its online seller marketplace this week we've got a picture for you rope tree journalist son'll assembly required it's actually in 1899 it's not overpriced but it is possibly the worst t-shirt I've ever seen in my life and so you'll be shocked to find out that people had a problem with Walmart selling this online it had been offered by a third party seller teespring calm which also offers on its site a coffee mug featuring the slogan so that you can start your day with some hatred for the Free Press and let's see the arty dnace is a group of journalists who looks out for journalists rights and all of that ask them to take it down they put out a statement that they're investigating at Walmart and it did get taken down and then the executive director of the Archie DNA said we are grateful for Walmart's swift action but dismayed that it and anyone else selling this shirt would offer such an offensive and inflammatory product we live in an environment in which political and ideological discourse has deteriorated to the level where some find it appropriate to advocate violence targeting journalists merely for performing their constitutionally guaranteed duty to seek and report the truth and we actually have a picture - you can see this here from back in 2016 at a trump rally oddly enough that it was at a trump rally this guy is uh we're in the rope tree journalist shirt yeah so actually several journalists reported seeing a shirts like that at those rallies so these shirts have been around in a while around a while and I know the right-wing and there was a reaction what's the big deal man we're just joking around about murdering journalists right okay well then let's flip it because I know that most Republicans have deep trouble with empathy but so if it said robe treat Trump some assembly required my guess is that you wouldn't think that that was a funny joke and you see looking at men how about if it said a gun bullet Trump's head some assembly required yeah my guess is that you wouldn't think that was funny and nor should you rope tree NRA member have a rope tree priest oh my god they might have a problem what it's just a joke it's just a joke right no and and the reality is it's not much of a joke because Trump actively attacks the press day-in day-out he he lies about what they say he actually puts out fake news himself and when during that campaign when they were wearing those shirts he would put the press in a cage his campaign manager famously assaulted a member of the press yeah a Republican running for Congress in Montana body-slammed a member of the press and in that one yeah and and then of course he put out the meme I which I didn't care about of him doing the wrestling move and body slamming a guy with a CNN had it done without it yeah and and he's and then when he was with to thwart a joked around and do thwart a talked about killing members of the press which arguably he might have done another thing that another friend of his Putin has done often and he simi joked with duterte like no big deal so no it is a big deal and it is serious and in fact it does happen quite often unfortunately here and abroad yeah we have some stats for you according to the u.s. press freedom tracker at least thirty four journalists have been physically assaulted in the US just this year and we've still got December according to the Committee to Protect Journalists at least 48 journalists have been killed in other countries thus far this year as you pointed out sometimes in random acts of violence or terrorism obviously journalists who go to war zones are at a risk of being killed that's one of the reasons it's such a courageous thing to do but then you also have governments like Vladimir Putin openly killing journalists who do report in ways that they don't like and we've had in the US I mean we reported a couple of years ago on the guy who you know wasn't as far as we know a political thing but the guy who walked onto a live shot of a live reporting and shot and killed a journalist and then you have the as you point out the politician who's able to assault a journalist and then win right after that Trump supporters don't care anymore they have been told the media's evil the media is the enemy that's literally what Donald Trump said and we're supposed to pretend that that doesn't matter that that doesn't then filter down to his supporters you know to the state media like Sean Hannity but also to regular conservatives and when they assault people at their rallies when they assault activists possibly journalists we supposed to act like that doesn't have anything to do with Donald Trump and him giving the highest possible level support for those sorts of actions we don't have 34 journalists being killed in America this year yet but this is exactly how you move in that direction yeah that's what I want to end on John it's if we let them you think these guys wouldn't do that assembly so the the reason that you resist then you fight back and and you call this out is because if you if you let them keep wearing these brown shirts around one day they're gonna take action on it and and and then if it becomes normal they're gonna do it again and again and they're gonna do it worse and worse because ideologically they don't mind violence no and it is a scary undemocratic impulse and yes we should fight it tooth and nail you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
