1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,760
These are Doctor Who fans — arguably some
of the most passionate fans of any show.

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,740
And this year, they’re especially excited
because, for the first time in the show’s

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,780
55-year history, the Doctor won’t be played
by a white British man — it’ll be a woman.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,060
“Oh brilliant!”

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,000
This move adds Doctor Who to an influx of
sci-fi fantasy franchises who have already

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
put women at the helm.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,070
But this new woman Doctor is expected to have
a trait that those other heroines don’t

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,620
have — a sense of humor.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,100
“This is gonna be fun.”

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,750
For those of us not as invested in the show
as this guy — Doctor Who is the story of

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,489
a mysterious alien being (known as the Doctor)
who travels through time and space having

12
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,710
adventures and fighting evil.

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,989
But the Doctor has one particularly special
ability — when the character is mortally

14
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,250
wounded, the doctor can regenerate into a
new body.

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,560
The Doctor has had 13 different faces over
the years — all white, British men.

16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,520
This is one of the first episodes of Doctor
Who, from 1965...

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,250
The Doctor was an eccentric old man who often
relied on his more courageous companions to

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,650
get him out of some sticky situations.

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,170
Support me, dear boy.

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,061
In fact, in early concept notes from one of
the show’s co-creators, the character of

21
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:36,420
the Doctor was described as “a frail old
man lost in time and space.”

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,070
But as time went on, and different actors
rotated through the role, the Doctor went

23
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,390
from being a frail trickster to a male hero
archetype.

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,800
The Third Doctor in particular played the
role as an “action hero”

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,700
“Violent exercise makes me hungry.

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,810
Don’t you agree?”

27
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,140
Fast forward to the Tenth Doctor, and the
action hero traits had become baked into the

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
character...

29
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,760
“Leave this planet and never return — what
do you say?

30
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,420
Yes.

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,120
All well then.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,620
Thanks for that!”

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,660
But there’s one particular personality trait
that stayed from the beginning...

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,460
The Doctor has a gleeful, almost childlike

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,460
personality.

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,540
He’s a hero with a sense of humor - which
makes the character fun and compelling to

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,040
watch.

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,060
But that kind of character complexity has been

39
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,880
typically reserved for male heroes.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,240
Female superheroes are very much
pressured to be taken seriously because there

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,660
are so few of them, they have to do well.

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,180
In 2014, the last time good data was available,
only 14% of mainstream sci-fi films had a woman

43
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:54,580
protagonist.

44
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,930
Women are not only vastly underrepresented

45
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,560
in sci-fi fantasy films, they’re often
restricted to generic superhero personalities.

46
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,579
If I think about the leading female
superhero... think about the Wonder Woman

47
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,020
film...She's powerful she's strong … But
she's not a funny funny character.

48
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,660
She laughs, but doesn't crack jokes, she doesn't have banter in the

49
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,600
same way that male superheroes can do.

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,620
That seriousness is consistent across most
woman characters on-screen.

51
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,370
Take a look at this scene between Guardian
of the Galaxy’s heroine, Gamora, and one

52
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,800
of the film’s villains, Nebula.

53
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,719
Gamora puts up a pretty awesome fight.

54
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,880
But compare that to Peter, the film’s male
hero...

55
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,380
notice the difference?

56
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,919
There’s also Black Widow from The Avengers
whose whole personality is built around being

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,420
stoic.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,109
And Katniss Everdeen, who can do some serious
damage with a bow and arrow but barely ever

59
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,620
drops her steely persona.

60
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,420
Of course, there are some examples of funny

61
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,590
heroines in film and television.

62
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,540
One of the earliest is Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,659
These examples are still rare on-screen, but
there is one medium where heroines have more

64
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,889
complex personalities...

65
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,940
Female characters who do humor, do very well
in comics...

66
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,179
Squirrel Girl, Kamala Khan, Gwen Pool.

67
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,560
From a financial point of view, it is less
of a risk.

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,680
Because there's less of a pressure

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,840
on a female-led title to do well, there's more
room for comedy, there's more room for humor.

70
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,020
It’s this scarcity of women superheroes
in film and television that makes the new

71
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,650
female Doctor’s role even more impactful.

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,740
This woman doctor is not only expected to
be a great witty hero traveling through space

73
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,479
like her male predecessors, she could also
push the boundaries of what a woman hero can

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,100
be...

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,560
To have a female Doctor, that's a win for
a lot of us.

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,760
Women, young girls will get to see someone

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,220
that looks like them

78
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,940
be smart and interesting and funny and that
is incredibly important.

79
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:14,909
So even if you’re not one of the millions
of people worldwide who watches Doctor Who,

80
00:05:14,909 --> 00:00:00,000
next time you see an awesome new woman superhero,
you might have the Doctor to thank.
