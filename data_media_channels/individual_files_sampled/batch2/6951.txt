I'm gonna call one part of it which is that and this is painful to say but Alice is not going to win so it's only 25% reporting so you can say hey that's too early but I've covered a lot of elections it's not too early she's at forty four thousand votes second places at two hundred and twenty four thousand votes you're not gonna close that gap so a Feinstein will move on and right now it is too close to call between DeLeon who was a Democrat and James Bradley who's a Republican in terms of who is going to be in the general election runoff I'm still calling it at least still at 5% and he's in LA and in San Francisco he's whooping him with what's there so far so so you think Elio is gonna be writing so it has been fluctuating I could be wrong but based on what's in and what's not in assuming there's not something where you know sometimes just weird things with the reporting I think that the LA numbers are going to make it that's good for Democrats so yeah so it do do I have any love for Kevin de Leon no do I want him instead of Bradley of course you want to Democrats instead of a Democrat and a Republican so that's why we tell you to vote in primaries if if it turns out that you had feinstein in a republican you'd have the lesser of two evils now you have two fairly standard politicians if we're right about this Feinstein and deli owned what is said theoretically sports medicare-for-all so in theory he would be an improvement over Weinstein there's more room to move the needle as opposed to find Sam who's so stuck and people can change so and jelly has a jolly yeah fine side keeps claiming she's changing I don't believe a word of dynast I over dianne feinstein's so-called changes but but deleon do what i base on their current positions would i prefer them to feinstein yeah and that's what happens in a general election you're down to two people and then you got to pick between those two people so I have made up my mind and didn't even think about it until this moment because up until now we we were rooting for Alison hearts and obviously now let me come back to Alison and mention two things there well what is that Alison is now in is in third place among the Democrats so fine signed DeLeon and then Alison Hartson so when she went in she had started at nothing no name recognition no money she didn't take any PAC money so she didn't have a chance of getting raising huge amounts you guys grassroots donors I think over 10,000 of you individual donors gave over $400,000 she got two thousand volunteers she ran an absolutely amazing campaign in the incredibly limited time that she had she only had seven months to put together that campaign and run it and so she beat all the other Democrats other than the two politicians and it's something and I'm not I'm not trying to say hey it was amazing and we almost won no look look at the numbers right and and she's a 2% and there are still a bunch of Republicans ahead of her for now LA and San Francisco are still outstanding as we're doing this live and and so she might move up that list but she's not going to move up far enough to to finish second obviously so but I want to tell you about it a very important misconception in politics that people will often shake their heads in it if you heard about Alice's how could she lose to these standard corporate politicians or to Republicans in in California that doesn't make any sense you're missing the most important thing you heard about her so you get that she's way better than them and you're right for California putting aside my politics or your politics her politics matches California better than any of the other candidates I think I could fairly say that for objectively now look at this point the race is over so it's not I'm not trying to convince you to vote for her it's already over so but the problem is that most people never got to hear about Alison hearts so that is the number-one problem and people keep going out and and if you're a person that's not deeply involved in politics is understandable but the media also makes that same mistake it drives me crazy that's their job they're supposed to know better so they say well I guess the voters wanted DeLeon or Bradley know the voters only heard about them because they spent millions of dollars in advertising whereas the progressive candidates especially the ones that run with no corporate PAC money don't have millions of dollars so it's not a fair contest they never got to hear about whether it's Alice in heart center or other progressives that were in the race and by the way in this case a lot of the Republicans had no money or the other Republicans in the race so they never had a shot that is exactly what's wrong with money in politics well so if you have public financing and you have so you end a private financing it has two advantages one is that then they're not serving private interests otherwise of course they are we told you about this 100 times Feinstein says no to Medicare for all turns around Oh two weeks later and takes checks from health care insurance companies in a fund raiser why do you think she did bad why do you think she's against Medicare for all because that's what they paid for that's what private financing of Elections gets you public financing gets you people representing public interest but the second part is not talked about enough which is that it actually gives you the voters a shot at figuring out who you like better as a candidate it's an even playing field where you actually get to hear both sides the Republican side the Democratic side the progressive side the more establishment side and you might think hey I like experience I'm gonna go with by sign or she's done good things in her career or you might think hey I like to progressive I like Allison aartsen it at least gives you an opportunity to hear all the candidates and make an informed decision right now what we have is some candidates with a giant megaphone and all you ever hear about is them and other candidates you never ever hear about that is it's not just unfair to the candidates it's unfair to you guys the voters because you don't get your real choices that's why we have got to get money out of politics and we've got to end the private financing of Elections by the way how can you do that well that's the group Alison Herzl was the national director of wolf dash pack.com you got to get in that fight because if we don't fix that we're never gonna fix any of these elections and the metaphor the megaphone is the best metaphor for it because when you equate money to speech and people have more money corporations and individuals have more money guess what they have louder speech so a megaphone is the exact right way to describe it by the way one of the things that can happen with Alison I don't want to speak for her I haven't talked to her at all about we never discussed not winning right it's a terrible attitude to have so we didn't have that and we're both I think in our own ways killers and so that's not how we think but now that it's it's done Alison could go back to being national director of Wolfpack and watch out hey so put that organizing power back in a Wolf Pack and that would be amazing Mike Mineta who was Koch national director with her who's been handling the ship without her is fantastic he's an excellent leader and an excellent organizer but him and Alison have been an unbelievable team so so let's see well I've talked to Alison and see see what she does next
