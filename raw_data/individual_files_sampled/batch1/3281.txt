the doctors were shocked when they got back and he'd say like oh my god he gained way they were very excited about that I think the food in space is great you get to pick all the stuff that you like and you rate it and then the dietitians build a menu for you so you have a balanced menu some of my favorites were lasagna ravioli I like the Italian food I did like the macaroni and cheese you also like the hamburgers and the hot dogs for breakfast I liked I'm getting hungry for breakfast I liked scrambled eggs you have some yogurt bread was an issue you don't really get bread because it create crumbs and it's hard to keep bread fresh crumbs are a problem from start floating around if you can inhale oh and get me rye they can get an equipment it's not good so you want to want to minimize the crumbs that are there so we would use tortillas we would have two tortillas when you need it when you wanted to wrap something up I think the best thing about space food is that it's easy to cook you don't have to mix ingredients or anything it all comes self self prepared and some of its dehydrated where you add water to it and let it soak that water in like the macaroni and cheese you can put in the oven for a while to warm it up we also have meals ready-to-eat where it's already prepackaged its thermal stabilized which means that it's been cooked and then sealed so it doesn't need to be refrigerated refrigeration is a problem in space and the thermal stabilized stuff was like beef fajitas ravioli lasagna really good food just need to throw that package pick it out of the draw throw it in the oven and come back in about ten minutes and it's warm cut it open very carefully with your scissors you always have your scissors and your spoon with you on you and you're in space you never know when you might get hungry I gained a little weight in space which is I'm the only secondly the second astronaut that I know of that gained weight you know that the doctors were shocked when I got back and each day like oh my god he gained way they were very excited about that not that I helped prepare Hubble but that I actually gained weight this is the big thing for the scientific community the medical community but I really like the food and it's it's it's easy to cook
