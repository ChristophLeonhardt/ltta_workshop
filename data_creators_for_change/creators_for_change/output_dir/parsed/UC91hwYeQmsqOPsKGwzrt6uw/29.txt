dear Uriah you woke up this morning and
asked me if you were five yet and I'm
like oh you just turned four there's so
much to enjoy about for both ways our c4
is like almost 5 which is dope
but just remember as you're jumping and
leaping into the next thing you got to
focus on where you are right now you may
be hearing this at the age of 10 15 or
25 but the point is right now is all
that matters so enjoy it
all this struggles all the hardships and
you not being able to reach certain
points you're gonna get there and I know
because I watched you go from the
crawling to walking actually it was more
like crawling to running but I'm here
for all of you
monster is eating money
yes the monster is eating money maybe I
don't know Elmo do not fill that and
then I go why not awaiting dear Theo
you're the oldest chocolate baby and I
just want you to know how important your
position is and even though you are the
oldest
that doesn't mean you always gonna be
the first
you see being a leader means
understanding who you are and I
appreciate that you know your limits I
appreciate that you know what you're
capable of and what you may not be
capable of yet
but buddy come here let me tell you
something
guess what I'm scared too
I'm scared to buddies are you scared no
no look so this one we're gonna do since
we're both scared we're gonna conquer
our fears together you're gonna I'm
gonna do it and then you're gonna do it
okay I think you could do it
but here I'm gonna do it okay and then
you're gonna do it with me and you're
gonna do it next okay I can't hold you
it's too far I'm not tall enough can you
hold me listen watch your brother
good job right boom
yeah
oh you did it buddy
watch out Ryan
what are you gonna do okay what tonight
okay
what are you doing it is scary I told
you it was scary
the longer you wait the harder it is
don't jump on the blue no babe I told
you that I told you you were making fun
of me
she got stuck dear you struggling to get
out of that situation already focused on
jumping into the next this is life it
was so interesting I was in this gym
with my kids
and I'm watching everyone jump and
struggle and some people do things with
ease but the journey is more about
turning your frown to smile not about
comparison see I was thinking my life
should be a natural progression it
should always be like a rising scale but
it's interesting that this gym
represents life more than not you
struggle to get to some places and other
places are easy but most of all what we
should be doing is enjoying the journey
so whether we're trying to climb we're
scared to jump you fall and we get back
up when we fall the grace and finesse
enjoy
and your father is there to cheer you on
as you continue oh you got it you got it
good job buddy
