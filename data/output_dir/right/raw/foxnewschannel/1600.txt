00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:03,724

108
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:05,626
SOMEONE IS CARRYING TO PUT THE

109
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:07,027
MONEY AND THE TIME INTO MAKE

110
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:08,229
SURE THEY ARE SAFE.

111
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,064
WHAT IS GOING ON?

112
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,432
I FEEL THE FRUSTRATION OF THE

113
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:12,433
PARENTS THAT HAVE HAD CHILDREN

114
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:15,035
SET OF BEEN INJURED OR MAIMED OR

115
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,471
KILLED BECAUSE WHY IS IT THAT

116
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,506
EVEN ONE MORE SCHOOL SHOOTING IS

117
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:21,242
ACCEPTABLE AS A CASUALTY OR

118
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,810
COLLATERAL DAMAGE?

119
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,178
WHY CAN'T -- IT'S NOT HARD TO

120
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:24,812
DO.

121
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:26,747
I WOULD HAVE DOGS AT THE SCHOOL.

122
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:27,881
I WOULD HAVE ONE POINT OF ENTRY

123
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,050
SO THERE'S SOMEONE COMING IN AND

124
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,419
THERE IS AN ATTACKER, YOU CAN

125
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,888
BOTTLE CAP HIM IN AND SECURE AND

126
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:36,190
PREVENT ADDITIONAL LOSS OF LIFE

127
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,024
THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL.

128
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:38,225
YOU'VE GOT TO PREVENT THEM FROM

130
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:41,729

132
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,031

133
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:44,665
WATCH.

134
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:48,035

135
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,837
SCHOOL, OKAY, THROUGH A METAL

136
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:51,405
DETECTOR AND MAYBE HAVE SOMEBODY

137
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,040
THERE, AN ARMED GUARD, DOGS

138
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,340
THERE.

139
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,508

YES, IT'S NOT PLEASANT BUT IT'S

143
00:03:58,912 --> 00:03:59,947

144
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,282
WITH IT.

145
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,950
IT IS LIKE NOT TREATING A

146
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,450
DISEASE.

147
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,052
BEING TOLD YOU HAVE CANCER AND

148
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:06,487
REFUSING TO TAKE A MEDICATION

149
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:06,954
FOR IT.

150

00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:12,626

155
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,402
WOULD NOT GO TO SCHOOL UNTIL GUN

LAWS ARE CHANGED.

157
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:24,037

HE BELIEVES THIS IS A BRILLIANT

159
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:29,810
AND TRAGICALLY NECESSARY IDEA.

160
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,379
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A POWERFUL

161
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,447
MESSAGE BUT NOT PRACTICAL IN

ANYWAY?

163
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,617
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO SCHOOL?

164
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:38,352

165
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,853
IF IT'S NOT DONE ON A LARGE

166

BUT IF IT'S DONE IN THE LARGE

168
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,590
SCALE, IT'S THAT WITH AFTER THE

169
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,259
SAW AFTER THE EVENTS IN PARKLAND

170
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,460
WHERE THE VOICE IN THE POWER OF

171
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,861
YOUNG PEOPLE SING I DON'T FEEL

172
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,730
SAFE IN MY SCHOOL, MOM AND DAD,

173
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,500
IT REALLY DOES HELP TO GET

174
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,269
PEOPLE TO SAY WE HAVE TO

175
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:58,038
THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

176
00:04:58,038 --> 00:04:59,640
CHILDREN, OUR CHILDREN, OUR

177
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,641

188
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:18,926

00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:21,829
MORE THAN THAT.

192
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,030
>> Kimberly: DID THEY HAVE

193
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,897
METAL DETECTORS AND MAKE SURE

194
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:26,300
THERE WAS ONE POINT OF ENTRY?

195
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,068
>> Juan: NO, MY POINT IS WE

196
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,636
ARE LOOKING FOR EVERYTHING.

197
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:30,838
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WITH

198
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,673
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

199
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,441
THEY TALK ABOUT THIS GUY IS A

200
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:36,143
BAD GUY, GANG MEMBER, WHATEVER

201
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,445
OR HE HAD A GRUDGE OR HE WAS A

202
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:38,779
STALKER.

203
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,881
THE FACT IS, THERE'S TOO MANY

204
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,950
GUNS IN THE COUNTRY.

205
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,818
BUT NOW IN MEDIA PLACES ARE

206
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:46,620
GOVERNMENT OFFICES, WE PAY TO

207
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,021
PROTECT PEOPLE.

208
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:50,224
WHY DON'T WE SAY AS AMERICANS,

209
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,025
MORE THAN ONE GUN FOR EVERY

210
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:52,626
PERSON.

211
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:55,662
THIS KID GETS HIS DAD'S GUN.

212
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:57,030
THE GUY IN CONNECTICUT GOT HIS

213
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,298
MOM'S GONE.

214
00:05:58,298 --> 00:05:59,233
>> Greg: YOU WERE GOING

215
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,200
FORWARD TO PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS

216
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,270
AND THEN YOU GO BACK TO TOO MANY

217
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,570
GUNS.

218
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,771
>> Juan: IT'S IMPRACTICAL TO

219
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:07,007
TALK ABOUT GUNS?

220
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:08,442
>> Greg: WHEN YOU SAY THAT

221
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,010
THERE'S TOO MANY GUNS, THAT'S A

222
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,612
BLANKET STATEMENT THAT DOESN'T

223
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:11,912
APPLY.

224
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:13,347
>> Dana: IMAGINE IF YOU DIDN'T

225
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:14,581
GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE'S TOO

226
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:14,948
MANY GUNS.

227
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:16,850
YOU WILL NEVER GO TO SCHOOL

228
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,251
AGAIN.

229
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,285
ALL THE THINGS KIMBERLY

230
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:18,652
SUGGESTED.

231
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:20,821
LET'S SAY MAYBE THERE WAS A WAY

232
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:23,023
TO HAVE A COMPROMISE.

233
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:24,424
WHAT'S JUAN IS SUGGESTING

234
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:25,492
THERE'S TOO MANY GUNS.

235
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:27,227
IN THE MEANTIME, IF YOU WANT

236
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:28,462
YOUR CHILDREN TO BE SAFE AT

237
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:30,464
SCHOOL, THE THINGS KIMBERLY LAID

238
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:31,765
OUT WOULD MAKE SENSE.

239
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:37,304
>> Greg: THERE ARE WAYS TO TAG

240
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,239
IT IS ACTUALLY TAKING GUNS AWAY.

241
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,374
>> Jesse: A LOT OF DEADLY

242
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:41,408
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS HAVE HAPPENED

243
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:42,442
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.

244
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,044
THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH.

245
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:46,847
BUT THE AMOUNT OF GUNS IN THE

246
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:47,848
COUNTRY HASN'T QUADRUPLED.

247
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,483
IT'S BEEN RELATIVELY STEADY, AND

248
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:50,884
THERE HASN'T BEEN A MASSIVE

249
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:52,252
DEREGULATION OF GUN LAWS.

250
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:53,453
WHAT HAS CHANGED?

251
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,489
GREG, YOU ARE RIGHT.

252
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:56,490
THERE IS A COLUMBINE COPYCAT

253
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:56,857
SITUATION.

254
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:59,226
THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND

255
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,060
THE iPHONE.

256
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,261
THE OVER PRESCRIPTION OF

257
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,463
PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS FOR TEENS.

258
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:04,898
THE PROMISE PROGRAM,

259
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:06,266
CYBERBULLYING.

260
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:08,268
THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO

261
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:08,936
CRIMINALIZE CRIMINAL KIDS.

262
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:10,871
THE POLLS SAY 57% OF THIS

263
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,472
COUNTRY THINKS IT'S A MENTAL

264
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:13,707
HEALTH ISSUE.

265
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:15,642
ONLY 20 OR SO PERCENT BELIEVE

266
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:18,211
IT'S A GUN-CONTROL ISSUE.

267
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,413
MOST PEOPLE DO WANT STRICTER GUN

268
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:20,047
CONTROL.

269
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:22,749
THE TWO THINGS THEY WANT: NUMBER

270
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:23,617
ONE, STRICTER BACKGROUND CHECKS

271
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:26,687
AND NUMBER TWO, MORE MONEY SPENT

272
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,488
ON MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS.

273
00:07:28,488 --> 00:07:30,190
TO DEMONIZE THE NRA IS A

274
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,259
POLITICAL SOLUTION BUT NOT A

275
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:32,859
PRACTICAL SOLUTION.

276
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,661
NRA MEMBERS AREN'T MASKED

277
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:35,462
SHOOTERS.

278
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:36,797
THEY USUALLY NEUTRALIZE MASKED

279
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:37,164
SHOOTERS.

280
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,066
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THE LABOR

281
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,400
UNIONS SPEND MORE MONEY LOBBYING

282
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,168
THEN DOES THE NRA.

283
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,503
IF THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO DO

284
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:44,304
SOMETHING ABOUT GUN CONTROL,

285
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:45,706
THEY HAVE THE HOUSE AND SENATE

286
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,240
FOR TWO YEARS UNDER OBAMA, THEY

287
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,475
DIDN'T DO IT.

288
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:49,576
THE CITIES THAT HAVE THE

289
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:51,311
STRICTEST GUN CONTROL LAWS COME

290
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:53,547
USUALLY RUN BY DEMOCRAT MAYORS,

291
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,616
HAVE VERY HIGH RATES OF --

292
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:57,017
>> Juan: WHY DON'T REPUBLICANS

293
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:57,851
TAKE A STEP FROM EVERYBODY AT

294
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:00,020
THIS TABLE AND SAY WE AGREE.

295
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,687
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

296
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,289
WE ARE GOING TO DO BETTER ON

297
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:03,090
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

298
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,659
WE ARE GOING TO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE

299
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:06,193
TO YOUNG.

300
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:07,928
>> Greg: THAT WOULDN'T HAVE

301
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:08,662
PREVENTED THIS.

302
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:09,896
>> Juan: THE IDEA, YOU CAN

303
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:11,331
ALWAYS SAY IT WOULDN'T HAVE

304
00:08:11,331 --> 00:00:00,000
PREVENTED THIS ONE BUT WE CAN DO
