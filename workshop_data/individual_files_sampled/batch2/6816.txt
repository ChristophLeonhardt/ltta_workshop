recently susan sarandon sent a innocuous tweet one that is meant to be productive and helpful to progressive causes which is unsurprising given that susan sarandon is incredibly progressive and everybody's known this for a long time and since she was progressive she was for the more progressive candidate in the primaries and then in the general election so none of this is surprising so she wrote a tweet saying I stand with the dreamers who make our country stronger check out the thread below to see how you can defend that gun now so she's trying to make sure that the dreamers are not kicked out of the country okay that seems great no not to some for the Hillary Clinton supporters they found this to be outrageous so there was an article written by Brandi Amara Skye on B et with this headline liberal celebrities who helped elect Trump kindly shut the fuck up about daca hmm is that right is it was it Susan Sarandon who ran Hillary Clinton's campaign who she was a campaign manager that's news to me I didn't know that because it was a Bernie Sanders who lost the Donald Trump no I mean it was Hillary Clinton right maybe I'm getting a wrong I'm not a journalist who works for be to your daily banter etc so maybe I'm getting confused here but it's not just as a strand they also went after rosario Dawson here's somebody saying Robin Stowe on Twitter going rosario Dawson says Hillary Clinton is not a leader at a DNC event now that's the just a tweet just mentioning that Rosario says that Hillary is not a leader in that but in the bTW article rosario Dawson attacked whether they're not the only ones they also attacked Colin Kaepernick they say well I mean he was great for fighting for black rights by taking a knee during the national anthem and across but he said that he did not vote in the election so he got a nephew as well and a middle finger and a tweet now here's another person on Team Hillary who was outraged that the celebrities were actually more progressive than them but now they are pretending that these celebrities are less progressive it's very confusing all sorted out for you in a second including Hillary Clinton quotes that you might find quite edifying alright so here we go to Molly mangle wood she tweets voting third parties a good way to marginalized groups know that your abstract principles are more important than their very real lives you know there's another good way of letting people know that is by losing to Donald Trump okay but anyway we'll again we'll get to that in a second so now I did not vote for a third party candidate and I worked very hard against Hillary Clinton in the primaries because I thought she was an inferior candidate I was 100% right about that and all the polling was on our side and against all these people who now say oh my god I can't believe we lost the Donald Trump well that's because you ran o candidate that was clearly scientifically worse than Bernie Sanders I don't think that's our fault I think that's your fault now whether somebody would for a third-party candidate or not is a nice excuse for a Hillary Clinton the person that you guys loved who lost the donald trump but it is a very poor excuse I know the weather wasn't right and Comey and Russia and all of that who ran the campaign who lost to a guy who was sitting at a 37 percent approval rating on the day of the election God you guys are pathetic honestly Danny fun ro writes in now attacking Rosario among others and Cornel West here we go oh yeah trust me I'm not forgetting you're rosario Dawson or you Cornel West they all contributed to what we have now should be ashamed okay so Cornel West fighting for civil rights his whole life doesn't count because he did not bow his head to the establishment candidate now Cornel West said that the establishment candidate was a candidate who had a better chance of losing to Donald Trump in the Republicans thereby endangering the dreamers he was right about that but no no no no now brother West you are a part of that elite now wait a minute he was for the more progressive guy nope doesn't matter does it matter but he was for the guy who had a much better chance of winning according to every single poll including on the day of the election Bernie Sanders had a 12-point least lead to Donald Trump whereas Hillary couldn't lost the donald trump nope no I don't believe in polls I don't believe in math I don't believe in science I don't believe in anything I must protect the establishment while pretending the susan sarandon rosario Dawson etc or the elite okay this is hilarious so before I go further I must clarify Hillary Clinton's position on this so let's go to 2014 when Hillary Clinton spoke about this issue let's see what she had to say about kids who have come into the country and whether they should say but we have to send a clear message just because your child gets across the border that doesn't mean the child gets to stay so we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey mmm it looks like there was a candidate who was not for kids who had made it into a country into America staying it was not just Donald Trump it was Hillary Clinton oh you're not allowed to say that about our beloved establishment Hillary Clinton well I didn't say she said look they I want to be super fair here I'm gonna give you the full context of that conversation okay so later Hillary Clinton's switch their position and said oh yeah yeah daca dreamers yeah I'm trying to win an election here and and she would say well I wasn't referring to the dreamers I was referring to people who were just coming in through the border and we had a lot of folks coming in through the border in 2014 who would one day become potentially dreamers but anyway give you the full context here's the whole video error is not sufficient law enforcement or will on the part of the governments of those countries to try to deal with this exponential increase in violence drug trafficking the drug cartels and many children are fleeing from that violence should they be able to stay here safer it may be safer but that's not the answer I do not should they be sent back that well first of all we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide we have children five and six years old who have come up from Central America we need to do more to provide border security and so there's Mexico this should be sent back now well they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults and their families are but we have to send a clear message just because your child gets across the border doesn't mean the child gets to stay so we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey remind me who's for daca and who's not for daca who's for the dreamers and who's not for the dreamers now you're telling me because Rhonda rosario Dawson etc said hey we don't necessarily trust Hillary Clinton to do the right thing here because in the past and not the distant past that was 2014 she spoke out against children who came here being said back are you for sending them back well I mean once we got a guardian in in in a country yeah we sent him back Bernie Sanders didn't say that even Jill Stein didn't say that Hillary Clinton said so do your homework first but nonetheless here goes ask I again we're not just angry at you she says to the celebrities we're angry at all those people who didn't listen when we tried to tell them to the sky was falling that all this was going to happen but the difference is their Twitter feeds don't reach millions their words didn't make headlines and influence many of the Millennials who opted to stay home on Election Day they weren't nearly as effective in trying to convince the world a purity test mattered more than white supremacy that was all you boo well Brandi you supported the candidate that wanna blue zhing the election that was all you boo you wound up supporting a candidate that actually wanted to send the kids back that was all you boo they supported a candidate who had an excellent chance of winning and if he had won not only would he had not done any of the things that Donald Trump has done or potentially the things that Hillary couldn't would have done but he would have gone further in helping those communities and when he promised to help those communities more Hillary Clinton now in her book writes about all he wanted everybody to have a pony so when you fought for Hillary Clinton that was all you boo Bernie Sanders did not lose the election to Donald Trump Hillary Clinton that it is amazing that I have to remind people of that almost every day we did a poll here I don't want to repeat it here but who lost who is more responsible for losing the election because in Washington among the elite and the establishment they genuinely believe it's Bernie Sanders which is so mental our poll has it at 97.4% Hillary Clinton lost the election and 2.6 percent saying Bernie Sanders is the one who lost the election I don't know who to the 2.6 percent are but you can go ahead and vote on it it's tea white tea network.com slash laws but apparently we have to keep reminding these people okay one last one from brandy she says and the reality of your privilege is this your delusion of sameness has cost us our bodies our rights and our security while your own remains unscathed is this the solidarity the power of the people of which you speak is this what you want us to rally behind your false ideals and movement of disconnected privilege so for fighting for the little guy whether it's Sanders who I did during the primaries now I didn't vote for Stein but I don't begrudge them voting for Stein you see cuz it is the responsibility and I caution it yes and I didn't think that it was the right thing to do but that was my opinion and I don't hate them for voting for Stein cuz Stein is not what cost Hillary Clinton the election Hillary Clinton is the one who caused herself to election so the much greater mistake was picking her in the primaries in the first place and guess who was in favor of that the elite so don't go around pretending these guys who fought for more progressive candidates are somehow that elite and have their privilege no you backed the most Pro establishment status quo candidate of our lifetimes so don't pretend you're not that elite don't pretend that the other guys are the elite but it's just not remotely true now finally we go to the daily banter who is you know I remember my previous piece on them there is not a Hillary Clinton thing that they will not get behind there is not a Bernie or progressive position they won't attack so they're like oh yes let's jump in this they ask but what is Susan Sarandon done here's a couple of highlights since the election she refused to apologize for her previous remarks why won't you bow your head Susan why do you continue to have progressive positions while we pretend to be more progressive than you but said during the primaries you were too progressive well daily banters forte is not logic and apparently she's also fought Debra Messing on Twitter I did not know that that was a grave offense I don't know where Messing stands but I didn't realize that was a thing that you can uh you messed with Debra Messing remember you guys are celebrities but my celebrity Debra Messing is awesome that's funny how that works and Katy Perry's awesome because she was behind Hillary Clinton oh my celebrities are great you know what you guys sound like Republicans Ronald Reagan's Austin Donald Trump is awesome ted nugent is awesome but your liberal elites celebrities we hate celebrities unless there are celebrities hey they did a concert for Hillary I loved him so much okay Jeremy faster from the daily fluffer continues this she that Sarandon is preferring to spend her time retweet retweet II sophists on Twitter and going to film festivals you know why she's doing that because she's an actress that's her job again sounding like a Republican Stewart go to film festivals yeah that's called working for a living if you work in films okay finally one more from the banter her statement on daca is as empty as the ones Republican politicians make after mass shootings occur and the same rebuttal to them applies to her mister ending fuck your thoughts and prayers okay you know I'm not you're wrong a mil progressive that you're used to in Washington DC that goes oh my god I am shocked dis yer grin us call for civility and unity and of course that's a trick the unity is unite behind Chuck Schumer NASPA lo Pelosi otherwise we'll blame you for all the things that Republicans if done oh really how Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton done in defeating Republicans all right they have a miserable miserable record they lose the Republicans all the time why do you think we want to get rid of them they have lost the house the Senate the White House to a monster the Supreme Court 69 out of 99 state legislators but you keep telling me daily banter and as sky and all these people who are still tweeting about Hillary Clinton and how awesome she is and how we should about our head to her that somehow the Democratic Party knows how to win and then if we do support the Democratic establishment then we are responsible for what Republicans do know you're responsible for Donald Trump in the Republicans because your candidate the one you back is the what they're reading is them is the one that lost to them I don't want to keep repeating this stuff I get tired of it too but when they go out there and do their propaganda on a thousand different outlets who else is gonna fight back and then when we fight back they go oh yeah you see that there goes the Young Turks and they are they keep talking about a blaming Hillary Clinton for the loss while you guys are blaming everyone else under the Sun and using all of the mainstream media to do it it's gross so yes we will fight back and for your stupid idea to back the establishment candidate then I return it right to you I don't believe in civility or unity under your umbrella so fuck your thoughts and prayers instead we could have won we could have protected the dreamers but it was your fault that we didn't help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network calm /join
