(jazz music)
-  Who has had the greatest
influence on you and why?
- Probably my parents.
Because they taught me
that if you love something
you'll work hard at it, and the only way
to be great at something
is working hard at it.
- My brother.
He was mentally ill, and
he taught me a lot about
the reality and the richness of diversity.
- Probably my mom.
And my dad.
My dad because he's a
professor of physics,
and so he's very analytical,
and good at approaching
problems in a systematic way.
And then my mom, because
she's always up for fun,
and doing something a little crazy,
and a little bit untraditional.
And so I think I have both sides to me.
- My dad, by far.
He's given me some of the best business,
and career, and professional advice,
and he was always been my mentor,
my hero,
my friend.
- Every time I was with my dad,
even up to this day, he
finds the person in the room,
who needs a kind word the most,
and makes sure he gives it.
- My father.
By all means that taught
me the value of hard work.
The value of doing right
for the first time.
