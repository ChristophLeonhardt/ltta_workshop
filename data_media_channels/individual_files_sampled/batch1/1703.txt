December 2011 South Korea's channel a launches a new program it was a hybrid part optional in show parts beauty contest the only prerequisite contestants had to be defectors from North Korea there's never been a program about North Korea before North Korea was only ever seen through the news which kept talking about nuclear issues the North Korean army how poor North Korea is that was it for the first time now my way to meet you showed the real story of how North Korean people live their culture it has helped break down prejudices I think the program prepares us for unification it was the beginning of a trend South Korean channels eager to find a different lens through which to present North Korea could finally break away from the usual portraits of famine and human rights abuses and add an element of entertainment the question of whether they break down prejudices or reinforce them is difficult the fact the matter is they mostly do both simultaneously they certainly seek to convey information about North Korea there's a very famous song a young boy appears on North Korean TV singing this song and then one of the panelists on one of these shows will sing the song in a way that mimics that North Korean boy is singing style so in the editing suite or in some of the the ways they are framed they have the tendency to reinforce some prejudices as well Sasha wanted to put away key the original intention of those programs was to depict the harmonious future of a unified Korea by showing how well the factors integrate into South Korean society but they mostly show young women describing their struggle to defect from North Korea so this gives South Koreans a distorted impression of defectors and it creates prejudices about the country 70% of North Korean defectors are women and the ones that find themselves on TV often end up reinforcing our cultural stereotype that beautiful North Korean women are the best partners for South Korean men in shows like love unification young North Korean women are paired with South Korean men who proceed to instruct them on the ways of the modern developed country in which they now live the messaging is less than subtle and it conforms to the South Korean nationalistic narrative that North Korea is the weaker female nation that needs protecting by the stronger more masculine sound the concern is that such a caricature immature and objectified image of these women is then extended to all North Korean defectors and to the North Korean population in general so South Koreans may end up looking down on North Koreans or thinking we can treat them careless we're not a Nagase there's another issue that doesn't help with the perception of North Koreans on occasion some defectors testimonies have been sketchy and inconsistent park eunmi is a defector who became a celebrity after a run on now on my way to meet you her story's attracted a lot of attention but as discrepancies crept into her accounts skepticism grew he aren't afraid to sing they will oh thank you everyone but it's almost impossible to fact-check these stories and the defectors themselves say they are reporting the truth or turns our I mean America voyage easily Mar it's that person's problem if they say one thing here another thing there it is hard to say that North Korean people do that or that these programs make them do that their memory may change or they may remember something else at another time but I don't think the programs are to blame and s kohaku crinklaw clone proven there are such cases but at the same time poverty in North Korea is real and it's also true that North Korea ignores human rights tenancy house will go back to Ghana solidad Unga and you pave a chromatid amo so we need to see these stories it may not be his or her own story they may have heard it from someone else and made it theirs but even when that happens the story exists throughout the new year we need to be a little bit empathetic about the way collective memory and individual memory interact with each other a lot of these people left North Korea several years ago as many as 20 in some cases quite a lot of them were very young when they left so inaccuracies in their stories should not automatically be put down to malice as younger has expanded so to have the narratives on the publicly-owned channel EBS good friends brings together North and South Korean teenagers in a more sober setting and on the web some of the younger defectors have begun self-publishing on a streaming platform Africa TV which is a sort of South Korean YouTube please self broadcasters interact with the viewers directly through the chat boxes that accompany their broadcasts allowing for a relatively unfiltered discussion between South Koreans and North Koreans without any of the production framing in between and they discover that they are not so different after all but half this shows actually helped in their stated goal of unifying the two Koreas you don't probably while these programs contribute to making South Koreans interested in North Korea the majority still think that it's a weird state and these programs make people think how is it possible for us to live with them no way and so they end up reinforcing anti unification ideas Connie Momoko amazonica North Korea is always described as a poor state its people are starving their human rights are infringed people see it as pathetic and they feel a sense of alienation but over time the image of North Korea here has improved a lot people are realizing that they can actually communicate with North Koreans so the shows are having a positive effect an advocate s Authority in a situation when stories about North Korea remain scarce politicized and controlled defectors are a rare source of news that the information they provide gets turned into infotainment says as much about South Koreans the television market and viewing habits as it does about their neighbors to the north you
