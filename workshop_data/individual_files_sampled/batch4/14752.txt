one of the best fake news fails and boomerangs I've seen in a long time I'm gonna tell you all about it one of the greatest fake news fails I've seen in a long time was I mean executed with precision this weekend by the left now the left is up in arms over these reports that immigrant children are being separated from their families never mind that it's always happened if a family decides to come into the United States illegally well then they can't cry foul when they are placed in adult detention and their children are placed with foster families that's the way it happens if they have relatives here that's not the case if they have other guardians here the kids could be placed with them but that happens who American citizens if an American citizen without any other family or any guardian for the child that can properly care for the child is incarcerated sadly tragically unfortunately that child goes in her foster care but whose fault is that it's not the fault of the government it's not the fault of the criminal justice system and in this case it's not the fault of immigration and customs enforcement no no it's the fault of the parent that decided to break the law the parent that decided to come here illegally the parent that risked incarceration and sadly the children suffer which can't blame the government for this either government but that didn't stop the left over this past weekend so the left led by Jon Favreau not the actor Jon Favreau the director Jon Favreau who was a speechwriter for the Obama administration yeah jon favreau is one of the most vocal guys on the left alongside lunatic moron Ben Rhodes Tommy Vietor the whole Obama crew the whole pajama boy Obama crew so Jon Favreau alongside CNN's hadass Gould read it out a story a story that read first glimpse of immigrant children at holding facility now they were joined by liberals like a guy from ProPublica T Christian Miller with tweets we they treated this out and he Christian Miller wrote showing immigrant children being held in what's basically a kennel and when you read when you read the initial comments that's horrible Trump is evil Jon Favreau's original tweet hadass Gold's original tweet that they've since deleted slamming the Trump administration these children are being held like prisoners these children are sleeping on cold concrete floors this is horrible how dare the Trump administration well then they put out another story uh Antonio Ariano who's a reporter on ABC 13 and use tonight dug into this guy big illegal immigrant guy you know Pro amnesty Pro ever ething wants to flood our nation with illegals open borders he puts out a tweet over the last couple of days and few days ago Isis largest family detention center horns County residential center in Texas run by contractor geo group has a prison bus just for babies and it's a picture of a bus with car seats where children now it's not a prison bus it's a bus it's like a school bus is sadly again it take these minor children into foster facilities when their parents break the law when their parents break the law okay now Jon Favreau how to delete his tweet and let me explain why and let me tell you how Jon Favreau then tried to spin it the Obama because that story first glimpse of immigrant children at holding facility well that story that story originally ran in 2014 during the Obama administration that geo group press release about the bus that could transport children April 29th 2016 but it gets even better CBS News ran a report ran a story a cou report records claimed border agents neglected and abused migrant kids they make it seem like this a current case because the ACLU is all over it right now right and the ACLU is all over it but buried in the story well let's see one two three four five six seven eight let's see where it is buried in the story I'm sorry here one at the bottom of the second paragraph one sentence the records the ACLU obtained hover ready for this from roll please 2009 to 2014 now when many of us conservatives started to point out to John Favreau and Christian Miller and Antonio Ariana's and hadass gold hey guys thank you thank you for showing the world how cruel the Obama administration was to illegal alien children they didn't apologize for lying to the public for disseminating this information from their verified accounts as if it was current information they didn't admit they were wrong they didn't hammer the Obama administration no all they did was delete their tweets and hadass gold from CNN admitted she deleted her tweet because it was from 2014 she openly admitted her bias but the greatest backpedal the greatest backpedal was from the Obama administration Jon Favreau he tweeted after he was caught these awful pictures are from 2014 when the government's challenge was reconnecting unaccompanied minors who'd showed up at the border with family or a safe sponsor hey in 2018 the government is creating unaccompanied minors by tearing them away from family at the border now Barbara was was excoriated he was mocked relentlessly for this Obama had been president for five years in 2014 he had been president for five years it was mid-20 that story was like April June to June of 2014 I forget the exact date but he had been president for five and a half years and Favreau was trying to say that oh no we were seeing was humanitarian efforts by the Obama administration but Trump is creating the problem never mind that Obama had five years to change the policy if he so wished he never did the ACLU found the greatest abuses of immigrant children from 2009 UN's excuse me excuse me to 2014 the start of Obama's presidency at a time when those photos were taken yet the mainstream media and the Obama administration sycophants cannot bring themselves to admit what their own facts tell the world that the Obama administration was abysmal on its treatment of illegal alien children now Trump wasted no time seizing on this he he wasted absolutely absolutely no time so Trump tweeted Democrats mistakenly tweet you know he loved every minute is Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama's term showing children from the border and steel cages they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires Dems must agreed a wall a new border protection for good of the country bipartisan bill exclamation point he went on to say well he didn't but his followers did just again abusing the Dems but see this is the problem Democrats lie Democrat fine I've seen every insane conspiracy theory from Jon Favreau saying well those kids were in the cages for their own good it's this is becoming a trend those kids were in the cages for their own good Obama is wonderful we spied on the Trump campaign to protect Trump right this is the new spin of the left when an image when evidence of severe wrongdoing of egregious behavior by the left is in front of America's face the left new strategy and they're being like I said relentlessly mocked for it is to say oh yeah we did that but we did for a good reason oh yeah we did that we did it for a good we robbed the bank but we want to give money to poor people we did that but for a good reason now perhaps the most unhinged unhinged rant on these reports about migrant children but again they didn't read that all this happened under Obama came from a CNN contributor and black activist / journalist April Ryan April love is that person who ever watch the White House press briefings you will hear April Ryan ask these moronic questions always race-baiting always racially geared and April Ryan put out a tweet she tweeted out a story from the route which is a very black centric media outlet very liberal is the Trump administration running a child trafficking ring and this root story is bizarre claiming that all of these problems with migrant children are because the Trump administration is selling them into sex slavery now luckily she was called out a spokeswoman for the for the first lady Stephanie Gresham this first lady's communications director Paul doubt April Ryan Stephanie Grisham tweeted quote if you're a journalist with many followers and and April Ryan is a CNN political contributor presumably page as a contributor title you're a journalist with many followers and a CNN politics contributor is it okay to retweet any headline you want regardless of if it's true remember quote the core purpose of a journalist is to research document write and present the news at an honest ethical and unbiased way end quote but April Ryan a CNN politics contributor somebody who has a White House press credential he's in The Daily Press briefing he's in the morning gaggles is sending out is tweeting out insane conspiracy theories insane conspiracy theories about the White House engaging in child sex trafficking and that's why they're losing immigrant children but again April Ryan should have read the CBS story now let's talk about CB s story ah that shows that the Obama administration engaged in some pretty egregious abusive abridges abuses of minor minor illegal alien little kids the ACLU is alleging that the department homeland security office for civil rights and civil liberties and DHS Office of Inspector General have quote failed to fully investigate much less rectify egregious abuse and neglect of migrant children a records the ACLU obtained covered 2009 to 2014 now the ACLU also claims DHS does not have appear to a report of the alleged child abuse to the FBI all back during the Obama administration Customs and Border Protection's that was greatly disappointed that the F be ACLU did not know to 2014 OIG inspection that says those claims were unfounded they didn't report on anything they didn't report at the ACLU didn't want to look at this during the Obama years years they don't even wanna look at this during the Trump years because it implicates Obama but they already stepped in their feet already wet they stepped in thinking they were slamming and smearing Trump when they subpoenaed the records the records they got showed that the most egregious abuse has happened under Obama much like the story of in Arizona Central from 2014 who that that implicated Obama much like the geo group story about the prison bus was from 2016 the ACL report you report 20 2009 to 2014 and the left made complete fools of themselves absolute fools of themselves but this this you know really underscores the broader problem the other day Obama made a comment I had know about paraphrasing had no scandals in his administration you know the Obama administration was scandal-ridden it was absolutely scandal-ridden but the mainstream media wouldn't report on it they were in a love fest with Obama their job was to protect the Obama at all costs but wasn't at the Obama administration didn't that scandal have scandals that you weren't told about them I wasn't told about them America was not told about those scandals America was kept in the dark about the scandals of the Obama administration but isn't it beautiful that due to their unhinged Trump derangement syndrome those same reporters those same Obama administration officials who buried the Obama administration's treatment of illegal alien children put out news articles from the Obama administration's time in office that highlighted just how bad those problems were this is all really important content and I want to bring it to you every day we need to hold the media accountable we need to also hold government's accountable and we're gonna be taking some steps here at the rebel to assist Tommy Robinson he is being held I feel many of us feel as a political prisoner in the UK it is terrible what happened at tommy jailed or well reporting on already disclosed public information about muslim rape gangs be sure to check the rebel twitter feed my twitter feed rebels facebook page hurts lictors and rebel CEO

worldwide very very important as always thanks for all the support thank you so much for watching I'll be back with you tomorrow
