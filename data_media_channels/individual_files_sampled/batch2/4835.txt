president Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani commented on the state of preparations for a potential interview between President Trump and Robert Muller NBC's Kelly O'Donnell tweeted Giuliani says he has done both in person and by phone sessions with the president he says he's doing the Q&A quote to educate me and Giuliani says I want to know what I can say that's not privileged and what I can say which is privileged the president lawyer also appeared to push Robert Muller on a September first completion deadline yeah that's not gonna 11 days ago that's for the media giulianat Giuliani told reporters that Muller had said he hoped to wrap up the investigation of the president by then but yesterday Giuliani seemed to suggest it was the Trump legal teams deadline for Muller to retain his credibility I really want that because I don't think he has he doesn't know that file was report by September first you know what's what's important though when you look at the calendar robert muller is not going to want to be dropping bombshells he's not giving tips - I know but he's not gonna want to be dropping bombshells in late September or early October he's not going to want to be doing anything that could be seen as affecting the election in the same way that James Comey helped elect Donald Trump two years ago by dropping that bombshell in October so you know I'm sure that if they could wrap up one phase of it by early September they would love to do that but you're not gonna see a lot of surprises in October belly to go through it and wait until after the election or they'll probably drop something in September Heidi do you think that Bob Muller and Rudy Guiliani are having deep conversations exchanging information on timelines I am thinking that Rudy might be overstepping the boundaries of truth once again here it just seems while Giuliani is insisting that this is still a possibility for the president to sit for an interview he's throwing down so many conditions that I'll also serve as stalling tactics that like Joe says this is inevitably going to get pushed off let's look at what he's doing here he's saying first of all this past week that he wants to look at personally at these Department of Justice documents that were used to brief lawmakers not going to happen secondly he's saying that the conversations between the President and any public official should be viewed as privileged and off-limits well who does that include Comey it includes all of the material that you just discussed from Michael Schmidt's story in terms of Rosen Stein so all of these things which they are tangental e selling to the base as reasonable are just not going to happen in the course of this investigation considering that obstruction is one of the major lines here of probing but secondly on sessions I just wanted to weigh in a little bit on this because some to the loyalty question guys I was on the plane with sessions just totally coincidentally it was right after the Access Hollywood tape had broken and I can vouch there is no official who was more loyal because Jeff Sessions was on that play he was the only surrogate with a horde of media who was still willing to stand there and take questions and stand behind this president when everyone else including Reince Priebus was heading for the exits Quillin and Mike Pence who is running running for the hills and making statements and going quiet and you name it every everybody around him was running for the hill well you talk about loyalty don't forget Jeff Sessions stood on stages with Donald Trump when the proposition that he would become president United States was completely absurd Jeff Sessions was the first guy memory he was the first guy with the hat Oval Alabama he gave cover to other senators to fall in later so if you want to talk about loyalty President Trump thinks he's disloyal I know one from the beginning has been more loyal Jeff sessions has so Rudy Giuliani was all over the place yesterday last night he was on Fox News where he talked more about the Trump legal teams aggressive and unconventional strategy against the investigation some people have criticized my strategy which if the president to some extent playing to the American people if this were a regular case I wouldn't be doing it but the people who will decide this are the people of the United States and the 2018 election and they boy they are switching fast and the Democrats are running for cover you don't hear them say the words impeach me anymore okay I love that because we've had so many Democrats on our show over the past year saying that they aren't going to say the word impeachment that impeachment is not their goal not the story that if they talk about impeachment they will not win in the fall they're focused on winning at the ballot box so I meet Willie that was it I thought that was really interesting yeah and you know you know at home I've got a supercomputer right yeah it's one of those like ignore yeah I guess it's like war game yeah exactly they got two of them they're stacked up against each other and so I fed in the question late last night after I saw this in court and the question was who has mentioned impeachment over the past because I don't do the Google right because the Russians watch whatever so I go to my yeah I got them a picture of Matthew Broderick up in there right you know and then what you're gonna make and then I'm gonna see how long you can drag this yeah I put it in there right and then I go and I get some coffee takes a minute yeah put some sugar mm-hmm I'm sorry come out and guess who it kicks out as the only person that's been talking about impeachment this past week who's that now Rudolph Beauregard Giuliani take a look the president can't be daddy gonna be impeach don't believe me could be impeached I believe that he could fight it that off and I think in fact he should apologize to him for putting him through this we're defending here it is for public opinion because eventually the decision here is going to be impeached not impeach members of Congress democrat and republican are going to be informed a lot by their constituents so our jury is as it should be is the American people and the American people yes are Republicans largely independent pretty substantially and even some Democrats now question the legitimacy of it not very tasty on I have not heard any Democrat speak is explicitly about impeachment of light as did Rudolf Beauregard Giuliani right you comb the halls of Capitol Hill have you found this is a question that I ask literally every Democrat that I interview I literally walked around the halls with a microphone and said do you think we're at that point and they all to a person basically with the exception of Tom Steyer who's not an elected Democrat they say we need the mother investigation to finish if there is evidence that there was wrongdoing then we'd be happy to address it then Nancy Pelosi is out there actively saying we cannot talk about this this would be a bad move for us this is not the correct political move to Rudolph Giuliani and alternate universe but one I gotta say where he was knighted by the Queen telling that that this is this is what what he is suddenly talking about I mean the the point that he's the only person talking about impeachment I think illuminates just how much this must be a part of the conversation behind the sunset the what it's also a political strategy because the President himself talks about it to energize Republicans that comes vote because he says if Democrats win the midterm elections they will have the power to impeach me we can't let that happen so so what are you looking at today where where where does this go next I guess we have to follow the bouncing Rudy right I feel like I spent half my time just trying to figure out what he says and then tracking him down have you can you tell us the site because I saw something a lot of what he says it's confusing but he said something along the lines of yet and talk to the president personally in a couple weeks yeah how often does he die I think and I would back to him and I asked him about that he says I'm talking to the president several times a day says I'm having a conference call with him Jay Jay Sekulow think he was having one so so did he have what Tom Hanks had and Joe and the volcano did you just have a brain cloud when he said I haven't talked to him and he's doing an enormous amount of media he saw and it fit for us reporters we have to sort of chase it I mean he is the president's lawyer and he is doing exactly what the president wants him to he's out there aggressively just pushing this message and the president thinks they are scoring points that they are really moving the ball here because they think it's a public opinion issue so he talks to the president daily yes yes and I take him at his word on Michael Schmidt thank you very much thanks for being on the show this morning and still ahead on Morning Joe the lawyer for stormy Daniels is again talking about tapes involving Donald Trump
