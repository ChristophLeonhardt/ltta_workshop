there is a wind of change blowing through Europe no perhaps just a breeze but in the eve of Vladimir Putin's visit here to Vienna the Austrian Vice Chancellor comes out and calls for an end to sanctions the sanctions have damaged our Austrian economy above all else and I've always warned against pushing Russia into the arms of China is high time to end these painful sanctions and normalize political and economic relations with Russia not exactly shocking not these days not after the Austrian Chancellor himself came out and called the US and reliable in that regard making up with Russia might counterbalance things such as friends allies Washington imposing tariffs on European goods a move that essentially began a trade war so now we will also impose import tariffs this is basically a stupid process the fact that we have to do this but we have to do it we will now impose tariffs on harley-davidson motorcycles on Levi's blue jeans and Borbon we can also do stupid we also have to be this stupid the logic is that by normalizing relations with Russia Europe would be better able to deal with Washington the idea is that the United States would behave itself properly we also need Russia to solve problems I mean we excluded Russia from the g8 now the problem is that the u.s. is following a policy the other six do not want perhaps Russia's return to the g8 would be a counterbalance and allow for counter policy but politicians say whatever suits them doesn't always translate into action it seldom does if anything then it's difficult to imagine that gargantuan and ponderous European machine changing tracks overnight or it used to be difficult to imagine we have to reconnect with Russia and I'm not very happy about the state of our relations not forgetting what our differences on diversity are but Basia passion has to be brought to an end well us-eu relations had taken some major blows recently Trump's decision to ditch the Iran nuclear deal was slammed by European signatories and then there's the relocation of the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem also caused big consternation Austrian Freedom Party MP johannes hope nur told us that russia and europe on the other hand have some common interest these days goods as well as Straka do you know exactly what the game is American game in Europe and what is in the advantage of Austria and what is against Austrian interests they know this and they know we have no conflict of interest at all with Russia Europe has no conflict of interest at all with Russia the only conflict is an American Russian conflict and this is leverage through Europe so everyone knows to steer clear from being used by assert non-european power against Russia is against their interest so that's what you know the only question is now how far they will dare to go what allies they will find in Europe
