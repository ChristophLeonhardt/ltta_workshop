NBC's Casey hunt has another development for us she's live now with a member of the House Intelligence Committee Eric's well it looks like Casey Hali thanks yes we are here with that congressman Eric SWA well a member of the House Intelligence Committee congressman small well what's your reaction to the president's decision to call this off well it's unfortunate I think talking is better than walking away but you know the president was rehearsing his endzone dance and we weren't even at the 50-yard line yet on this summit I think vice president Pence's de nuke or Die comments probably weren't helpful but you know I hope we can get back to the happiness summit I will give the president praise for even getting us this far but I think it was his own impulsive behavior and his advisors who have now satisfied there have been people including in your own party who have given the president credit for bringing these negotiations farther along that they may have otherwise do you think standing here today we are in a better place Vasavi North Korea than we were in the Obama administration not what this president though because he's so impulsive that the pendulum seems to swing from Nobel Peace Prize or our nuclear weapons are stronger than yours as he stated in the letter that he sent to Kim jong-un so I'm I do hope that we are able to find some moderation here and not go back to the bellicose war talks because we don't want war with North Korea we you know need cooler heads to prevail and stick to the strategy of applying pressure and getting them to the table there have been some strategists who suggested that part of the reason why there have been some changes in the president's approval ratings has to do with the fact that we were seeing progress here with North Korea do you think this is going to hurt the president at home people want peace yes it is gonna hurt the president home if it seems like we're getting back to the posture we were at before where he's you know insulting Kim jong-un where he's threatening to use our nuclear arsenal and you know American troops could be put in harm's way this seems to be a solvable issue if we can continue to work with the South Koreans the Japanese and the Chinese we can solve this crisis and we should you know seize that opportunity rather than go back to the childish impulsive behavior thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
