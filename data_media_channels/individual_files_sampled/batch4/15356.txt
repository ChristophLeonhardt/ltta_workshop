the race for the next Lewisham MP is heating up and the Labour Party seems to be discouraging men from standing as a candidate so it's technically momentum that's imposing this rule you can stand for the Labour candidacy you know run to be a candidate for labour if you want to if you're a man but it doesn't mean you're gonna get invited to the hustings because the hustings are being run by momentum and momentum if you don't already know is a hard left Corbin Easter Group within the Labour Party and it's the group that's basically taking control of the party ever since Corbin won and so what we're looking at here is a an all black and ethnic minority and all-woman shortlist and I was thinking about the legality of this so I was looking at opener you know how can you actually allow an all-woman shortlist and there was an article on labour list a Labour supporting website and it says here but on all B and E short whistle Eagle right here you ask all-women shortlists were made possible thanks to the sex discrimination election candidates act 2002 and the Equality Act 2010 permitted their use until 2030 so the Equality Act 2010 which I've got lots of problems which I've talked about before allows parties to just actively discriminate against non-white straight-man it says also in the article it says no such legislation has been introduced to entitle any party to use or be any short lists nor is the Labour rulebook been changed to authorize them what we're talking about when we discuss an all B AME women shortlist being used for lewisham East is therefore an unofficial act de facto not de jure it's possible that the likelihood of an obeah me shortlist in Lewisham East is both the most and least controversial part of this violation so there are looting to the fact that I just told you about this is a momentum thing not a labor thing there was one man I've seen that has put his hat in the ring and his name is Joe Dromi now when I saw the name Dromi and made me remember it made me think I know that name and it turns the whole Joe Dromi is Jack drom E's son Jack Dromi is the member of parliament who once called me obscene which is ironic for a man who once worked with the paedophile information exchange but Jack Dromi and Harriet Harman Joe Dromi is their son and he's trying to run for the Labour candidacy for lewisham and it's really funny because Harriet Harlan's the arch feminist in Westminster and she's the one who came up with the Equality Act 2010 she's the one who drafted that legislation and pushed it through Parliament and now it's hurting her own son brilliant so Jack Joe Dromi has put his name forward and there's a thread here on Twitter which shows that he was denied a chance to speak at the hustings so let's take a look at this he so this is a Bob from broccoli who's a blogger and Lewisham momentum and Lewisham momentum says here hi Bob from broccoli we welcome candidates to get in touch if they would like to speak at tonight's event given the vast numbers applying to be le MP we wouldn't be able to know of or invite all candidates so then Joe Dromi comes forward hi I've applied for the selection I'd like to join the hustings please let me know if you need any more information thanks Joe very correct Louis your momentum hi Joe we really appreciate the offer but with Heidi resigning we believe there should be an all-women shortlist to find the next candidate however it's great to see you supporting Momentum's role in the selection process I said Joe Dromi came back okay it's an open selection though so it's a shame members can't hear from all candidates true could you let members know why I'm not that wouldn't want them to think I just chose not to come hope it goes well and look forward to engaging with members next week how much of a cook do you have to be to look at what momentum just said say now you can't come you've got a penis you can't come to this this short list this hustings event you're a man and for him to just say oh I hope it goes well and please let them know that I'm not there because not out of choice but because I'm a member allowed oh it's so funny the Labour Party is eating itself and Joe Dromi has been cooked by his own mum she's the one who drafted the legislation that lets people do it brilliant um so I mocked all this as well there's the news that the the the front-runner the lewisham has dropped out she is the one who I talked about the other day who I couldn't pronounce her name it's filled something she's the black woman who ran black pride UK Phil Opoku yamir she's backed out she says it was for personal reasons but it did also come out not long after she compared the Palestine issue to Nazi Germany so I suspect she's been pushed out here and she's saying is personal I'm not sure about that you know even if something terrible had happened in your family this is a race to become a member of parliament it's a job you've got for the next four years because it's a by-election take the job take the damn job and then sort out the family issue later so I mean there's something going on here but I made all this mental stuff with labour there is news of two other candidates and that's from Yucatan from for Britain now you keep announced this morning that David Curtin is going to be the candidate for lewisham East he's not a candidate they've had before because funnily enough the old you get candidate for low esteem East was Anne Marie Walters she stood for them in 2015 she was meant to stand for them in 2017 but Paul not all didn't like her and Saudi selected her because she talked too much about Islam and then you Kipp he's now stunning David Curtin I'm not sure how well that's gonna go down if he's not really known locally it might be hard for them also I mean David Curtin's got a bit of a history here because he once got in trouble for saying that gay people are likely to have been abused by kids so abused as kids sorry so I'm not sure how well he's going to do here and our waters it'll be interesting I mean this really is a race between you Kipp and for Greta now hungary's if for Britain's gonna succeed it's gonna prove that it can beat UK and I think Yuki probably knows that so it's gonna be a bit of a battleground in Lewisham piece but what will be interesting is to see what happens with the 30 percent that didn't vote in Lewisham last time thirty percent of people don't vote if a party eight any party is able to grab those thirty percent they can change they can win the seat so it'll be interesting to see what happens with the non voters what the turnouts like by-elections are notoriously bad turnout so it could hurt everybody but Labor's already got a massive majority Labor's almost certainly gonna win so whatever black and ethnic minority woman labor chooses they're going to be the next member of parliament for Lewisham East more than likely and some of the candidates we've seen so far as I talked about the other day are not exactly Oh outstanding members of society some of them have got pretty extreme links so I mean what you expect from a constituency whose council is completely labour I looked on the council website for Lucian the other day every single councillor out of the lot of them is Labour that is a town that's doomed a town that's I've got you know crime rates skyrocketing the you know the reports of violent crime to the police in Lewisham increased by more than 60 percent between 2012 and 2017 if that's not a sign labour isn't working I don't know what is and so yeah all-women shortlists labor madness battleground between youk even for Britain this could be one of them are interesting by-elections in a while catch up with all the rebel stories on our brand new app
