-- 
>>> WE WILL BREAK INTO THAT 
STORY TO BRING YOU SECRETARY OF 
STATE MIKE POMPEO SPEAKING 
RIGHT NOW. 
LET'S DIP IN. 
>> COUNTERPARTS, WE MADE CLEAR 
TO THEM THAT WE TAKE THIS 
MATTER WITH RESPECT TO JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI VERY SERIOUSLY. 
THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY 
UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUS NATURE 
OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF  JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI. 
THEY ASSURED ME THAT THEY WILL 
CONDUCT A COMPLETE AND THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION OF ALL OF THE 
FACTS SURROUNDING JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI AND THEY WILL DO SO 
IN A TIMELY FASHION AND  THE 
REPORT WILL BE TRANSPARENT FOR 
EVERYONE TO SEE AND ASK 
QUESTIONS ABOUT AND TO INQUIRE 
WITH RESPECT TO ITS 
THOROUGHNESS. 
I TOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT WE 
OUGHT TO GIVE THEM A FEW MORE 
DAYS TO COMPLETE THAT SO THAT 
WE TO COULD HAVE A COMPLETE 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTS 
SURROUNDING THAT AT WHICH POINT 
WE COULD TAKE DECISIONS ABOUT 
HOW TO RESPOND TO THE INCIDENTS 
SURROUNDING JAMAL KHASHOGGI.  
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO THAT 
WE HAVE A LONG STRATEGIC 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KINGDOM 
OF SAUDI ARABIA. 
THEY CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT 
COUNTERTERRORISM PARTNERS AND 
THEY HAVE CUSTODY OF THE TWO 
HOLY SITES. 
THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC 
ALLIANCE AND WE NEED TO BE 
MINDFUL OF THAT AS WELL. 
WHEN I TRAVELED AND MET WITH 
THE TURKISH PRESIDENT, THEY 
TOLD ME ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND 
SAID THEY WERE CONDUCTING THEIR 
ON INVESTIGATION. 
WE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH 
SOME OF THE TEAM INVOLVED WITH 
THAT. 
HE ASSURED ME THAT THEY WOULD 
SHARE THE RESULTS WITH THE 
SAUDI GOVERNMENT AS WELL. 
WE BELIEVE THAT BETWEEN THE TWO 
EFFORTS, COMPLETE PICTURE WILL 
EMERGE FOR WHAT ACTUALLY 
TRANSPIRED. 
WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THAT AND 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT 
WRAPPING UP QUICKLY AND WE 
EXPECT IT WILL BE DONE IN THAT 
WAY. 
>> WHY SHOULD SAUDI ARABIA BE 
TRUSTED WHEN THEY ARE ACCUSED 
OF THE DISAPPEARANCE? 
>> WE WILL ALL GET TO SEE THE 
WORK BROUGHT. 
WE WILL SEE THE RESPONSE THAT 
THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA 
TAKES WITH US. 
WHEN WE SEE THAT, WE WILL ALL 
GET A CHANCE TO MAKE A 
DETERMINATION WITH RESPECT TO 
THE CREDIBILITY AND WORK THAT 
WENT INTO THAT. 
WHETHER IT IS TRULY ACCURATE 
AND FAIR OR TRANSPARENT IN THE 
WAY THEY MADE A COMMITMENT TO 
ME AND THE CROWN PRINCE 
MEDICAMENT TO THE PRESIDENT I 
BELIEVE IT WAS THE LATE -- THE 
NIGHT BEFORE LAST. 
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. 
>> THERE ARE LOTS OF -- 
>> CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING? 
>> THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. 
WE ARE JUST GOING TO ALLOW THE 
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. 
ALLOW THE FACTS TO UNFOLD AND 
AS THEY UNFOLD AND WE MAKE A 
DETERMINATION FOR OURSELVES 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BASED ON 
THE FACTS THAT ARE PRESENTED, 
THE UNITED STATES WILL 
DETERMINE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE 
RESPONSE MAY BE. 
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME 
TODAY. 
>> JUST HEARING FROM THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE, IT WAS A 
PRETTY BRIEF MEETING WITH THE 
PRESS TO BRING US UP TO SPEED 
AFTER HIS TRIP TO SAUDI ARABIA, 
AND TURKEY. 
AND WE HEARD HE GOT A PERSONAL 
COMMITMENT FROM SAUDI ARABIA 
THAT THERE WOULD BE A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION AND THE REPORT 
WOULD BE TRANSPARENT AND WE 
WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON 
AS THEY SEARCH TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS 
SAUDI JOURNALIST WAS MURDERED 
INSIDE A SAUDI CONSULATE IN 
ISTANBUL. 
>> TWO KEY POINTS CAME OUT, ONE 
IS THAT HE IS SAYING THAT THE 
U.S. WANTS TO GIVE SAUDI ARABIA 
A FEW MORE DAYS, A FEW MORE 
DAYS FOR THEM TO COMPLETE THEIR 
INVESTIGATION AND PRESENT THEIR 
SIDE OF THE STORY AND ONLY 
UNTIL THEY PRESENT THEIR SIDE 
OF THE STORY WILL THE UNITED 
STATES DECIDE HOW IT WILL 
RESPOND. 
THEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
MADE THE POINT TO SAY THAT THE 
UNITED STATES HAS AN IMPORTANT 
STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH SAUDI 
ARABIA DATING BACK DECADES AND 
THAT THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED 
AND PUT INTO CONTEXT AS WELL. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ARMS 
DEAL AND INFLUENCING THE REGION 
AND TALKING ABOUT HELPING IN 
IRAQ AND YEMEN. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE WAS KEEN 
TO MAKE THAT POINT AS HE WAS 
NOT READY TO MAKE TOO MANY 
DETAILS. 
>> HE TALKED ABOUT HIS TRIP TO 
TURKEY AND HE SPOKE TO THE 
PRESIDENT, AND THE TURKISH 
OFFICIALS ARE INVESTIGATING 
THIS AS WELL. 
IT HAPPENED IN TURKEY ALTHOUGH 
IT HAPPENED IN THE SAUDI 
CONSULATE. 
IT MEANS THAT TURKISH 
AUTHORITIES HAVE A LOT OF 
LEEWAY TO INVESTIGATE THIS. 
THEY ARE REALLY THE LEAD 
INVESTIGATIVE FORCE, AND SO HE 
ALSO SAID THAT WHEN HE TALKED 
TO THE PRESIDENT, HE MET WITH 
MEMBERS OF THE INVESTIGATIVE 
TEAM AND THEY SAID THAT THEY 
WOULD SHARE THE OUTCOMES OF THE 
INVESTIGATION WITH SAUDI 
ARABIA. 
THE HOPES ARE THAT WITH TWO OF 
THE INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON AND 
ALL OF THE INFORMATION BEING 
MADE TRANSPARENT, SOMEHOW, WE 
WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
>> HE SAID GIVE IT A FEW MORE 
DAYS. 
>> WE HAVE A GREAT DISCUSSION 
WITH AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA TO 
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF WHAT 
IS TURNING OUT TO BE A LITTLE 
BIT OF A POLITICAL CRISIS 
BETWEEN THE THREE COUNTRIES. 
AND A LITTLE BIT MORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI, JUST WHO HE WAS AND  
WHY HE WOULD BE ON THE RADAR 
FOR THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT AND 
WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO KILL 
HIM. 
>> EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR THE 
TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THAT 
DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENED TO 
HIM. 
>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> HELLO, I AM BILL WHITAKER 
WITH 60 MINUTES. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 
CONGRESSMAN MARINO. 
>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS 
OUT OF CONTROL. 
IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 
PEOPLE DIE. 
>> I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT 
THIS WITHOUT 60 MINUTES. 
>> I DID SEE THE REPORT. 
WE ARE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE 
REPORT. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE IT VERY 
SERIOUSLY. 
>> THEY ARE JUST DRUG DEALERS 
AND LAB COATS. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT A CHILLING 
PICTURE THAT PAINTS? 
>>> HI EVERYONE, I AM ANNE-
MARIE GREEN.  
>> AND I AM ERROL BARNETT. 
>> WE BEGIN THIS HOUR IN 
WASHINGTON WHERE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP JUST MET WITH  SECRETARY 
OF STATE MIKE POMPEO TO DISCUSS 
HIS TRIP TO SAUDI ARABIA AND 
TURKEY. 
POMPEO MET WITH LEADERS OF BOTH 
COUNTRIES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT 
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WASHINGTON 
POST JOURNALIST JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI. 
>> THE INVESTIGATION COULD  
WRAP UP BY THE END OF THE WEEK. 
>> Reporter: TURKISH FORENSIC 
INVESTIGATORS SEARCHED THIS 
BUILDING LAST NIGHT, THE 
CONSUL'S RESIDENCE, HERE IN 
ISTANBUL. 
THEY TOLD JOURNALISTS THEY 
BELIEVE JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS 
KILLED AFTER HE WALKED INTO THE 
SAUDI CONSULATE 16 DAYS AGO,  
BUT SOME REPORTS SUGGESTED HIS 
BODY MAY HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF 
HERE AT THE CONSUL GENERAL'S 
RESIDENCE. 
THEY ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO 
SEARCH A FOREST AND A FARMHOUSE 
TODAY, ACCORDING TO TURKISH 
MEDIA. 
THE NEW YORK TIMES IS REPORTING 
THAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES 
ARE INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT 
SAUDI ARABIA'S CROWN PRINCE IS 
CULPABLE IN KHASHOGGI'S 
DISAPPEARANCE. 
SEVERAL OF THE SUSPECTS 
IDENTIFIED HAVE LINKS TO THE  
PRINTS, INCLUDING ONE WHO 
APPARENTLY ACCOMPANIED MOHAMMED 
BIN SALMAN ON HIS U.S. VISIT 
THIS YEAR AND WAS PREVIOUSLY 
ASSIGNED AS A DIPLOMAT IN 
LONDON.  
SOME REPORTS WHICH WE CANNOT 
INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY ALSO HAVE 
GRISLY NEW DETAILS ABOUT THAT 
AUDIO RECORDING THAT TURKISH 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE FROM 
INSIDE THE SAUDI CONSULATE, 
INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS THAT 
KHASHOGGI WAS TORTURED AND HIS 
BODY LATER DISMEMBERED.  
>>> SECRETARY POMPEO SPOKE 
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE MOMENTS 
AGO AND SAID HE IS CLEAR THAT A 
CLEAR -- SAID HE IS SURE THAT A 
CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT HAPPENED 
TO KHASHOGGI WILL EMERGE.  
>> GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. 
I HAD A CHANCE TO BRIEF THE 
PRESIDENT ON THE TRAVEL I 
RETURNED FROM LAST EVENING. 
I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK IN 
RIYADH WITH THE KING, WITH THE 
CROWN PRINCE, WITH THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER. 
ALL OF THE UNITED STATES 
COUNTERPARTS THERE. 
WE MADE CLEAR TO THEM THAT WE 
TAKE THIS MATTER, WITH RESPECT 
TO MISTER KHASHOGGI, VERY 
SERIOUSLY.  
THEY MADE IT CLEAR TO ME THAT 
THEY, TOO, UNDERSTAND THE 
SERIOUS NATURE OF THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF MISTER 
KHASHOGGI. 
THEY ASSURED ME THEY WILL 
CONDUCT A COMPLETE AND THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION  OF ALL OF THE 
FACTS SURROUNDING MISTER 
KHASHOGGI AND DO SO  IN A 
TIMELY FASHION AND THAT THIS 
REPORT ITSELF WILL BE 
TRANSPARENT FOR EVERYONE TO 
SEE, TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT AND 
TO INQUIRE. WITH RESPECT TO 
FAIRNESS, I TOLD PRESIDENT 
TRUMP THIS MORNING THAT WE 
OUGHT TO GIVE THEM A FEW MORE 
DAYS TO COMPLETE THAT, SO WE 
HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE FACTS,  AT WHICH POINT 
WE CAN MAKE A DECISION HOW OR 
IF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD 
RESPOND TO THE INCIDENT 
SURROUNDING MISTER KHASHOGGI. 
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT  FOR US 
ALL TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE A 
LONG, SINCE 1932, LONG 
STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA. 
THEY HAVE CUSTODY OF THE TWO 
HOLY SITES. 
THEY ARE A IMPORTANT -- THEY 
ARE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC ALLY 
AND WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF 
THAT. 
WHEN I TRAVELED AND MET WITH 
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN, HE TALKED TO 
ME ABOUT THE INCIDENT.  
HE TOLD ME THEY WERE CONDUCTING 
THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION. 
WE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH 
SOME OF THE TEAM INVOLVED WITH 
THAT. 
HE ASSURED ME THAT THEY WOULD 
SHARE THEIR RESULTS WITH THE 
SAUDIS AS WELL. 
WE DO BELIEVE THAT THROUGH 
THESE TWO EFFORTS, A COMPLETE 
PICTURE WILL EMERGE OF WHAT 
ACTUALLY TRANSPIRED. 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT 
WRAPPING UP QUICKLY AND WE 
EXPECT ITWILL BE DONE IN THAT 
WAY. 
YES SIR. 
>> WHY SHOULD THE SAUDI 
ARABIANS BE TRUSTED? 
>> WE ARE ALL GOING TO GET TO 
SEE THE WORK PRODUCT. 
WE WILL ALL GET TO SEE THE 
RESPONSE THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI 
ARABIA TAKES. 
WHEN WE SEE THAT, ALL OF US 
WILL GET A CHANCE TO MAKE A 
DETERMINATION WITH RESPECT TO 
THE CREDIBILITY AND WORK THAT 
WENT INTO THAT. 
WHETHER IT IS FAIR AND 
TRANSPARENT IN THE WAY THEY 
MADE A PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO 
ME AND THE CROWN PRINCE ALSO 
MADE A PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO 
THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE SPOKE TO 
HIM, I BELIEVE THE NIGHT BEFORE 
LAST. 
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES 
OUT RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING? 
>> THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES 
OUT THERE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. 
WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE 
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. 
ALLOWING THE FAXED ONE FOLD. 
AS THEY UNFOLD, AS WE MAKE A 
DETERMINATION FOR OURSELVES ON 
WHAT HAPPENED, THE UNITED 
STATES WILL DETERMINE WHAT THE 
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WILL BE. 
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME 
TODAY. 
>>> MUSTAPHA IS A SENIOR FELLOW 
AT THE CATO INSTITUTE AND JOINS 
US NOW VIA WEBCAM FROM 
WASHINGTON. 
I WANT TO GET YOUR SENSE OF 
THESE REPORTS THAT ARE EMERGING 
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A 
MUTUALLY AGREEABLE DEFINITION 
OF WHAT HAPPENED TO KHASHOGGI 
THAT DOES NOT IMPLICATE THE 
CROWN PRINCE.  
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT AND 
WHAT MIGHT THIS MIDDLEGROUND BE?
>> TRUTH SHOULD BE ABOUT 
POLITICS -- SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT 
POLITICS. 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
THE ROGUE ELEMENT GOES ALL THE 
WAY UP TO THE CROWN PRINCE. 
IF THERE IS A POLITICAL 
SOLUTION, WHITEWASHING THE 
POPLE AT THE TOP AND FINDING 
BLAME AT THE LOWER LEVELS, THAT 
WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY MANY 
PEOPLE. 
I THINK THE U.S. SHOULD SEARCH 
FOR THE TRUTH. 
>> TURKEY HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE, 
AT LEAST IT LOOKS LIKE THEY 
HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
THEY HAVE SEARCHED THE SAUDI 
CONSULATE. 
THEY SEARCHED THE SAUDI 
COUNSEL'S RESIDENCE. 
A LOT OF THE GRUESOME DETAILS 
WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE CASE 
OR THE ALLEGATIONS ANYWAY HAVE 
COME FROM THE TURKISH SIDE. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON TURKEY AND 
HOW AGGRESSIVE THE EFFORTS ARE? 
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SINCERE 
AND WANT TO GET TO THE TRUTH? 
>> I THINK THEY WANT TO. 
TURKEY IS NOT A BEACON OF PRESS 
FREEDOM. 
BUT JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS SOMEONE 
WHO HAD GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE 
CURRENT  LEADERS IN TURKEY. 
SO I THINK THEY FEEL FOR HIM 
AND THEY FEEL THAT THIS WAS ONE 
OF THEIRS THAT THE SAUDI'S 
KILLED. 
PLUS THERE ARE BIG TENSIONS 
BETWEEN TURKEY AND SAUDI ARABIA 
ON VARIOUS ISSUES. 
I THINK TURKEY IS SINCERE. 
THEY HAVE TO DO ONE THING. 
THEY CLAIM TO HAVE THIS 
AUDIOTAPE. 
THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST SHOW IT 
TO SOME PEOPLE. 
THEY SHOULD SHOW IT TO 
WASHINGTON POST, U.S. OFFICIALS
, OR OTHER PEOPLE, THIRD 
PARTIES THE WORLD CAN TRUST. 
UNTIL THEY DO THAT, THERE WILL 
BE SOME QUESTION MARKS. 
UNTIL THEN, IT IS CLEAR THAT 
THEY DID DO SOMETHING TERRIBLE 
TO JAMAL KHASHOGGI. 
THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE 
SAUDI'S.  
IF HE WAS LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE STREET, THEY WOULD BE 
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, 
BUT HE WAS LOST IN A SAUDI 
CONSULATE. 
IT IS CLEAR AND PROVEN THAT A 
TEAM CAME TO ARREST HIM. 
WHAT EXACTLY DID THEY DO TO 
HIM? 
STILL UNCLEAR, BUT IT IS CLEAR 
THAT THERE WAS A CRIME 
COMMITTED AGAINST A PROMINENT 
SAUDI JOURNALIST BY HIS OWN 
COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT. 
>> DESPITE THAT, IT HAS BEEN 
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AND THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 
EFFECTIVELY SAID THEY ARE 
RELUCTANT TO TERMINATE THE 
URRENT ARMS DEAL AND THERE 
REALLY HASN'T BEEN MUCH SAID 
ABOUT THE PROTECTIONS OF 
JOURNALISM AND PRESS FREEDOM. 
WHEN YOU READ JAMAL KHASHOGGI'S 
FINAL, WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE 
FINAL, OP-ED IN THE WASHINGTON 
POST,  HE PROMOTES THE FREE 
JOURNALISTIC PURSUIT IN ARAB 
STATES. 
I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK THE 
IMPACT IS ALREADY BEEN AS FAR 
AS THE INTERNATIONAL STANDING 
OF THE U.S. SEND THIS ALMOST 
SILENCE ON WHAT WE ALL BELIEVE 
HAPPENED OR FEEL IS MOST 
LIKELY? 
>> IT HAS NOT BEEN GOOD. 
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE U.S. HAS 
BUSINESS INTERESTS. 
EVERY COUNTRY HAS THOSE 
INTEREST. 
BUT IF THAT IS THE ONLY THING 
WERE THE FIRST THING THAT COMES 
TO YOUR MIND AND THE THING THAT 
YOU EMPHASIZE MOST, THEN PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE REALLY COMMITTED CRIME 
WILL SAY, OKAY, THE U.S. WILL 
TOLERATE US. 
SO EVERY COUNTRY HAS TO THINK 
ABOUT STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND 
SO ON AND SO FORTH. 
>> DO YOU THINK THE CROWN 
PRINCE HAD THAT IN HIS 
CALCULATION IF HE IS FOUND OUT 
TO BE BEHIND THIS? 
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
WOULD DEAL? 
>> I THINK THE GOOD IMAGE HE 
CREATED IN THE WEST WITH 
COSMETIC REFORMS, THOSE ARE 
GOOD REFORMS, BUT HE DID THIS 
TO WIN SOME BROWNIE POINTS IN 
THE U.S. AND GET MORE POWER AT 
HOME. 
I THINK HE RELIED ON THOSE 
THINGS AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD 
NOT BACKFIRE THIS MONTH. 
-- THIS MUCH. 
HE IS OBVIOUSLY CALCULATING. 
IT DIDN'T WORK FOR HIM, EITHER. 
I THINK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF 
STANDING TOUGH ON THIS ISSUE. 
AS OTHER COMPANIES AND 
NEWSPAPERS HAVE DONE BY PULLING 
OUT OF THIS BIG MEETING AND 
SAUDI ARABIA. 
>> THE CROWN PRINCE, LIKE YOU 
MENTIONED, HAS CREATED AN 
IMPRESSION OF BEING A 
PROGRESSIVE PERSON. 
WE HAVE SEEN HIM LIFT 
RESTRICTIONS, BUT WE HAVE ALSO 
SEEN HOW HEAVY-HANDED HE CAN 
BE. 
WE HAVE SEEN HIM IMPRISONED 
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN FAMILY IN 
THE RITZ HOTEL. 
WE SAW HIM CREATE A DIPLOMATIC 
SPAT OVER A TWEET FROM A 
CANADIAN OFFICIAL. 
OF COURSE, WHAT IS GOING ON IN 
YEMEN AND THE BLOCKADE. 
WE KNOW HE CAN BE HEAVY-HANDED. 
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN 
WONDERING, WHY CHOOSE JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI? 
THERE ARE OTHER CRITICS OF THE 
ROYAL FAMILY AND THE 
GOVERNMENT.  
WHY DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE 
CHOSEN TO BE MURDERED, IF 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED? 
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK IT IS 
NOT ONLY JAMAL KHASHOGGI THAT 
HE AND HIS PEOPLE ARE GOING 
AFTER. 
TODAY THE WASHINGTON POST  
PUBLISHED AN INTERESTING STORY. 
A SAUDI IN CANADA WAS VISITED 
BY OFFICIALS AND SAID COME BACK 
HOME, OTHERWISE YOUR FAMILY 
WOULD BE IN DANGER. 
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS TO 
OTHER DISSIDENTS. 
BUT I THINK JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS 
IMPORTANT FOR TWO THINGS. 
HE WAS THE MOST VOCAL ONE, 
WRITING IN THE WASHINGTON POST. 
THE VERY CIRCLES THAT THE 
PRINCE WANTED TO IMPRESS AND 
MAKE FRIENDS OUT OF. 
THAT IS ONE THING. 
SECONDLY, PEOPLE LIKE JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI  WHO ARE NOT OUTRIGHT 
ENEMIES AND FANATIC, EXTREME 
VOICES, BUT WHO ARE ACTUALLY 
QUITE MAINSTREAM AND HAVE A 
FOLLOWING AND RESPECT AMONG THE 
MAINSTREAM PEOPLE, THAT IS A 
BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THE 
DICTATORS, BECAUSE THAT 
DISTURBS THE NARRATIVE THEY AIM 
TO CREATE. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY MEANT TO 
KILL HIM RIGHT AWAY, BUT 
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED. 
IT IS VERY PROBABLE HE LOST HIS 
LIFE AT THIS POINT, THE VERY 
FIRST DAY. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THE WORLD 
SHOULD NOT LET GO AND SHOULD 
NOT BE FORGOTTEN AND THE U.S. 
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD TAKE A 
TOUGHER STANCE. 
>> RIGHT AFTER THIS HAPPENED, 
NOT RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENED, 
BUT AFTER IT BECAME A NATIONAL 
STORY, I THOUGHT IT WAS 
INTERESTING. 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS 
ON THE CROWN PRINCE AND THE 
DECISIONS HE HAS BEEN MAKING, 
BOTH THE PRESIDENTS OF THE U.S. 
AND TURKEY BOTH IMMEDIATELY 
TALKED ABOUT BEING IN CONTACT 
WITH THE KING, NOT THE CROWN 
PRINCE. 
DO YOU THINK THE CROWN PRINCES 
POSITION COULD BE IN JEOPARDY? 
>> THAT COULD BE A WAY OUT. 
HERE THERE IS NO LOGIC TO SAUDI 
ARABIA AS A WHOLE COUNTRY. 
THERE IS THIS YOUNG PRINCE WHO 
FOUND ABSOLUTE POWER AT THE AGE 
OF 33 AND IS APPARENTLY AN 
AMBITIOUS MAN AND GOT 
INTOXICATED BY ALL THAT. 
IT IS POSSIBLE HE ORDERED THIS, 
BUT HIS OLD, 82-YEAR-OLD FATHER 
THE KING, MAYBE HE HAS NOT 
AWARE. 
-- MAYBE HE WAS NOT AWARE. 
NOW SOME ARE SUGGESTING THAT 
MAYBE THE KING COULD CHANGE THE 
CROWN PRINCE. 
HE COULD GO AND BE REPLACED. 
THIS IS POSSIBLE. 
MAYBE THAT IS WHAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD 
PUSH FOR, ONCE IT IS PROVEN, 
AND IT IS VERY LIKELY AT THIS 
POINT, THAT THE CROWN PRINCE 
WAS BEHIND THIS TERRIBLE CRIME 
COMMITTED AGAINST JAMAL 
KHASHOGGI.  
>> WHAT YOU THINK IS THE MOST 
LIKELY OUTCOME AT THIS STAGE IF 
THE SAUDI'S STICK TO THEIR 
STORY? 
>> I THINK THE NEXT STEP WILL 
BE TURKEY EITHER FINDING BODY 
PARTS -- THEY ARE SEARCHING 
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND TURKISH 
POLICE ARE SEARCHING A FARM 
OUTSIDE ISTANBUL, EITHER THAT, 
OR THEY SHOW THE TAPE TO 
CREDIBLE THIRD PARTIES. 
IN THAT CASE, IT WILL BE PROVEN 
THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED 
AND THEN GO ALL THE WAY UP THE 
SAUDI HIERARCHY AND PROVE THIS 
WAS THE ACT OF THE CROWN 
PRINCE. 
AFTER THAT, THE CROWN PRINCE 
SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED AS A 
LEGITIMATE ACTOR. 
LIKE THE U.S. SAID TO OTHER 
DICTATORS, THIS GUY SHOULD GO. 
I AM HAPPY LINDSEY GRAHAM 
ALREADY SAID THAT AND I THINK 
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IN WESTERN 
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD TAKE THAT 
STANCE, ONCE IT BECOMES PROVEN 
AND I THINK IT WILL BE, IN THE 
DAYS AHEAD. 
>> TURKISH OFFICIALS SAY THEIR 
INVESTIGATION WILL BE WRAPPING 
UP SOON. 
MUSTAFA AKYOL, THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR TIME TODAY.  
>>> TEXAS CANNOT SEEM TO GET A

INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS.

CAN TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE.

ALREADY CAUSED FLOODING IN 
DOZENS OF HOMES. 
IF IT RISES ANOTHER 14 FEET, 
THE WATER WILL FLOW

SUBMERGING ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. 
UPSTREAM, SCOTT TURNER IS JUST 
TRYING TO PICK UP THE PIECES.
