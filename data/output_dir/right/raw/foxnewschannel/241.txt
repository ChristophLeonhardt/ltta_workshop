1
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:10,112

00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:11,947
OUR WHITE HOUSE.

4
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:13,381
>> I THINK THE TRUMP WHITE

5
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:14,349
HOUSE NEEDS TO BE PUT ON

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,884
TRIAL FOR THIS SPECTACLE.

7
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,920
>> THIS IS WHITE SUPREMACY

8
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:20,288
BY VENTRILOQUISM.

9
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:21,690
BLACK MOUTH IS MOVING BUT

10
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:23,558
WHITE IDEAS ARE FLOWING FROM

11
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:23,959
HIS MOUTH.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,760
>> THIS WAS EMBARRASSMENT.

13
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:26,828
COUNCIL YEA'S MOTHER IS

14
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,030
ROLLING OVER IN HER GRAVE.

15
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,031
STEVE: SOME OF THE MEDIA

16
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:31,633

LET'S BRING IN CANDACE

21
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:36,438
OWENS.

22
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,405
SHE IS THE COMMUNICATIONS

23
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:39,341

00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:42,043
OF MONTHS SHE HAS BECOME

26
00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:43,445
FRIENDLY WITH KANYE.

27
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:44,479
CANDACE, WHAT DID YOU MAKE

28
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,181
OF SOME OF THOSE SOUND

29
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:47,282
BITES, FOR INSTANCE, TALKING

30
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:48,750
ABOUT HOW HIS APPEARANCE WAS

31
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,419
AN ASSAULT ON THE WHITE

32
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,720
HOUSE?

33
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,121
>> LOOK, ALL THE COMMENTARY

34
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:54,389
THAT I HAVE HEARD

35
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,824
SURROUNDING THIS MEETING HAS

36
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:58,059
BEEN ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE.

37
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,394
UTTERLY RACIST ESPECIALLY

38
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:03,298
COMING FROM CNN.

39
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,200
DON LEMON BRINGING UP

40
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,468
KANYE'S DEAD MOTHER TO DRAW

41
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:07,502
BLOOD FROM THIS MAN BECAUSE

42
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:08,970
HE DOESN'T AGREE WITH

43
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,505
LIBERAL IDEAS.

44
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:11,373
HE UNDERSTANDS DEMOCRATIC

45
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:12,040
POLICIES HAVE HARMED THE

46
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,141
BLACK COMMUNITY.

47
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:16,578
IS HE BOLD ENOUGH TO MOVE

48
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,413
THE BALL FORWARD AND SPEAK

49
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,315
ABOUT PUBLICLY.

50
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:21,550
IT'S DESPARTICULAR CABLE.

51
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:22,851
KANYE WAS BUILT FOR THIS.

52
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:24,519
>> WHAT IS HE LIKE?

53
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,887
>> I MET WITH HIM FOLLOWING

54
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:26,488
HIS MEETING.

55
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,290
HE IS JUST IN A VERY, VERY

56
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,191
POSITIVE STATE.

57
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:30,659
HE IS OPTIMISTIC.

58
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,693
HE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY WHAT

59
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:32,861
HE IS DOING.

60
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:34,896
I MEAN, THERE WAS A LOT OF

61
00:01:34,897 --> 00:01:36,498
HAPPINESS AND EUPHORIA IN

62
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:36,898
THE ROOM.

63
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,633
I SIMPLY SAID THE PARADIGM

64
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:40,101
HAS SLIFTDED BECAUSE IT HAS.

65
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:41,403
BLACK CONSERVATIVES WILL NO

66
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:42,470
LONGER BE FEARFUL.

67
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:43,371
BLACK CONSERVATIVES ARE

68
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,406
WILLING TO SPEAK OUT.

69
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:45,907
WE ARE EXCITED.

70
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:47,008
IT FINALLY FEELS LIKE IT'S

71
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:47,676
OUR TIME.

72
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:49,377
AND THE COMMENTARY MEANS

73
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:49,711
NOTHING.

74
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:51,880
IT WILL NOT DISSUADE US FROM

75
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:52,914
SPEAKING OUT.

76
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:54,282
BRIAN: KIND OF DRUG.

77
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:56,318
THE BACKLASH HAS BEEN SO

78
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:56,685
ENORMOUS.

79
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:57,485
YOU WOULD THINK THAT MAYBE

80
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,287
THE WORD IS KEEP YOUR MOUTH

81
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:00,889
SHUT BECAUSE WHO WANTS THIS

82
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,924
BLOW BACK, CANDACE.

83
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:04,125
CAN YOU BLAME SOMEBODY FOR

84
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:05,227
NOT COMING FORWARD WHEN YOU

85
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:07,128
GET THIS TYPE OF

86
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:07,529
RETRIBUTION?

87
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,296
>> I DON'T BLAME THEM.

88
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:09,764
I THINK IT'S ALL SORT OF

89
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:10,598
COME TO A HEAD.

90
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,133
IN THE PAST WE HAVE SEEN

91
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:14,002
THAT.  THAT'S WHY BLACK

92
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,270
CONSERVATISM WAS SO SHUNNED

93
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:16,738
AND SAW THEIR TREATMENT OF

94
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,306
DR. BEN CARSON, LARRY ELDER,

95
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:18,873
DR. CONDOLEEZZA RICE.

96
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:19,841
THIS IS A DIFFERENT TIME.

97
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:20,976
WE ARE AUDACIOUS.

98
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,143
WE ARE STANDING UP.

99
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:23,612
AT TURNING POINTS U.S.A. WE

100
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:26,615
HAVE OUR FIRST EVER YOUNG

101
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:27,716
BLACK LEADERSHIP SUMMIT.

102
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:28,383
BLACK CONSERVATIVES ARE

103
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,651
GOING TO HEAR THESE IDEAS TO

104
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:30,452
MEET THE FIRST FAMILY.

105
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:31,253
TO SAY HAVE THE PRESIDENT

106
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:31,786
SPEAK TO US.

107
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:33,188
WE ARE FEELING INSPIRED.

108
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,023
WE ARE FEELING BOLD AND

109
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:36,091
OPTIMISTIC AND FEELS LIKE AT

110
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,392
LONG LAST THIS IS OUR TIME

111
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:39,394
TO SPEAK OUT.

112
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:40,262
BRIAN: I KNOW YOU SPEAK TO

113
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:41,196
THE PRESIDENT OFTEN.

114
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:42,464
YOU KNOW DARRELL SCOTT AND

115
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:43,365
OTHERS.

116
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,966
WE HAVE HAD THEM IN HERE.

117
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:45,700
BEN CARSON.

118
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:46,901
THEY ARE MAKING SOME MAJOR

119
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,637
MOVES IN THE INNER CITIES.

120
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:49,437
WE KNOWED ABOUT NEW

121
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:50,338
OPPORTUNITY ZONES THAT'S IN

122
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,007
THE NEW TAX REFORM.

123
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,141
THEY ARE NOT DOING A GOOD

124
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:54,676
JOB GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT.

125
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,846
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT?

126
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,346
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M

127
00:02:58,347 --> 00:02:58,647
DOING.

128
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:00,315
I FEEL LIKE IN SO MANY WAYS

129
00:03:00,316 --> 00:03:01,283
THAT'S WHAT YOU I'M HERE FOR

130
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:02,751
TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT.

131
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:03,685
THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING THE

132
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:04,586
SUMMIT TO BRING OUR

133
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:06,154
COMMUNITY TO THE IDEAS.

134
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,722
I MYSELF AM LAUNCHING A

135
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:08,890
PROJECT NEXT WEEK WHICH I'M

136
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,492
NOT GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT

137
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:10,859
TODAY.

138
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,826
REALLY EXCITING.

139
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:12,961
WE WILL TARGET THE INNER

140
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:14,029
CITIES AND HAVE THESE SORTS

141
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,096
OF RALLIES AND CONVERSATIONS

142
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:16,464
TO KEEP THIS GOING.

143
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,033
KANYE HAS BUILT US A RUNWAY

144
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:19,401
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO

145
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:21,002
SQUANDER THAT OPPORTUNITY

146
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:21,569
WHATSOEVER.

147
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,404
STEVE: CANDACE, WHAT'S YOUR

00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,571
MESSAGE TO THE SOUND BITERS

149
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:24,773
WHO WERE ON TELEVISION LAST

00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,274
NIGHT AND WILL BE ON TODAY

151
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:26,975
TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT

152
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,277
WHAT KANYE SAID THERE IN THE

153
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:31,746
OVAL OFFICE IN THAT 10

154
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:32,614
MINUTE SOLILOQUY REGARDING

155
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:33,748
HIM AS CRAZY?

156
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:37,185
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO HIM.

157
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:39,721
>> MY MESSAGE IS I CAN HEAR

158
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:40,322
THEIR FEAR.

159
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:41,623
I CAN HEAR THEIR INSECURITY

160
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:43,091
AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THERE

161
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:44,025
IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEY

162
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:44,492
CAN SAY.

163
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:45,760
THERE ARE NO WORDS STRONG

164
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,629
ENOUGH THAT IS GOING TO STOP

165
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,963
THIS MOVEMENT OF BLACK

166
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:50,131
CONSERVATIVE THOUGHT.

167
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:51,933
STEVE: WHAT IS THE FEAR?

168
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,234
>> THEY ARE FEARFUL THAT

169
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:54,936
THEY ARE LOSING CONTROL AND

170
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:56,871
THAT THEY ARE LOSING POWER.

171
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,273
ONE THING SURPRISED BY

172
00:03:58,274 --> 00:03:58,940
DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY.

173
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,342
THEY WERE SURPRISED BY THAT

174
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:01,409
THEY THOUGHT HILLARY HAD

175
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:01,710
THIS.

176
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:03,645
THEY HAD DONE SO MUCH AND

177
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:04,913
INVESTED SO MUCH INTO HER.

178
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,514
AMERICA SURPRISED THEM.

179
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,149
THEY NEVER EVER EVER SAW

180
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,750
THISSING COMING.

181
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,418
THEY NEVER SAW AN AWAKENING

182
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,086
IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT

183
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:12,487
WE MIGHT START TO UNDERSTAND

184
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:13,888
OUR HISTORY AND UNDERSTAND

185
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,224
THEY ARE OUR OPPRESSORS THEY

186
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:18,026
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OUR

187
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:18,426
OPPRESSORS.

188
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:20,061
WE WILL NO LONGER LET THEM

189
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,629
OPPRESS US.

190
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,397
AINSLEY: HOW BIG IS THAT

191
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:22,764
MOVEMENT?

192
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:23,531
>> IT'S HUGE.

193
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:24,366
