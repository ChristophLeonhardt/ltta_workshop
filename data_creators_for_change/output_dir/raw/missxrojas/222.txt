8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,780

<font color="#CCCCCC">now that the whole like Harry Ron</font>

18
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,529
Hermione like what situation has blown

19
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,239
over a little bit the whole comment said

20
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,100
JK Rowling made and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> magazine</font>

21
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,809
that was taken completely out of context

22
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,430
that maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> hermione's shouldn't have</font>

23
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,890
married 10 this whole conversation Joe

24
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,360
be crazy and I love you<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

25
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">thoughts on it so I thought I'd wait</font>

26
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,719
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> it blown over a bit and then dive</font>

27
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,460
into it firstly it's a fantastic

28
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,719
interview so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me sad that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

29
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,829
taken out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of context</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that people</font>

30
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">focused on that one facet of that</font>

31
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,920
interview it's pretty rare that JK

32
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,239
Rowling gives interviews and you know

33
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is why because she can't say</font>

34
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,050
a damn thing without people taking it as

35
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,270
like this huge explosive comment it's

36
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,770
weird little thing actually because she

37
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,149
stays away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media because it's</font>

38
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">not something that she loves because of</font>

39
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,170
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when she does foray into the media</font>

40
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">other parts of the media pick up on it</font>

41
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,369
and exploded and it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's</font>

42
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,140
like overblown story likes that's like

43
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh Jacob all I actually said something</font>

44
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,890
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ridiculous in itself but</font>

45
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,330
that's not where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at today what I</font>

46
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,610
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about today is the ash tree</font>

47
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,229
that we have to the things she says when

48
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,549
she talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the Harry Potter books</font>

49
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,290
and it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> attitude that I can kind of</font>

50
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,090
understand because she has continued the

51
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,920
conversation in a way through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Porter</font>

52
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,479
more than through little comments but

53
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,369
that attitude that feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that whatever</font>

54
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,850
she says is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I the gospel or heresy or</font>

55
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,840
some extreme some living facts about the

56
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">story or some intrusion into the story</font>

57
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,399
that really frustrates me because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

58
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,439
very interested to see what she has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

59
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,970
say about the book that doesn't mean

60
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's fact it doesn't mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

61
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,970
me that changes anything for me like the

62
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">love situations and Harry water books</font>

63
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,899
would never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know interesting</font>

64
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,340
to me but I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are some</font>

65
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's completely fine but</font>

66
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear how her opinions</font>

67
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,290
change and what she thinks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

68
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,399
series and what she thinks about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

69
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,140
series in relation to other books and

70
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,909
what she thinks about books now and I

71
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to hear her opinion she's a</font>

72
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">very intelligent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> woman</font>

73
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,270
and I enjoy hearing her speak and

74
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,340
hearing her say things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing her</font>

75
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,020
that was same as<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak and reading</font>

76
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,850
articles and I just enjoy know what she

77
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,050
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say because she's such a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

78
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,510
storyteller I enjoy JK Rowling long as

79
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,610
they enjoy JK Rowling that's not all i'm

80
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,510
gonna say because i'm going to keep

81
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breanna what is your</font>

82
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,900
problem today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think from our</font>

83
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,990
perspective as fans or whatever other

84
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,970
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the media</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because you know a</font>

85
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,989
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to dicks I'm sorry not</font>

86
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,060
sorry other than the media the way we

87
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,160
react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that sort of information I</font>

88
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,690
think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what what</font>

89
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,700
we're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for we're kind of silencing</font>

90
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,930
her in a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways I say you can't</font>

91
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,640
talk about Harry Potter because we'll

92
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,890
treat it in this way and we'll go to the

93
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,810
extremes about it and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

94
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,550
part of an expression fact that we're so

95
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,080
devoted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these books and they mean a</font>

96
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,700
lot to us we love these stories and we

97
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,950
love these characters however we're not

98
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowing her to have that kind of</font>

99
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,459
critical distance from her own work

100
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,950
which i think is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

101
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,600
that's kind of a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our part</font>

102
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,580
expanding on that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're denying</font>

103
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,709
her a part of the creative process that

104
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:12,940
that's a very natural part of the

105
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,500
creative presence you want to be able to

106
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,730
look back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and think about these things</font>

107
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,780
and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things not</font>

108
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily to the press but she's</font>

109
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,560
chosen to talk about it too depressed to

110
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,620
Emma Watson or or to whoever that she

111
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,239
chooses<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with just the</font>

112
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,890
fact that we like latch<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto it in that</font>

113
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,239
way yeah it makes me deeply

114
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,890
uncomfortable and it makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad</font>

115
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,600
because I don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> her to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like</font>

116
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,610
she can't talk about these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

117
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,049
you can't say or maybe I shouldn't have

118
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe you know that doesn't</font>

119
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">change it her saying maybe I should or</font>

120
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,549
shouldn't have done this or now I'm

121
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,840
thinking or perhaps it would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

122
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to have the blast ended</font>

123
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,760
screws be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Horcruxes like that doesn't</font>

124
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the reality of the book that the</font>

125
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">book is finished and the fact that the</font>

126
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,700
book is finished is why she can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

127
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now even with possum what you</font>

128
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,060
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take that as fact that's</font>

129
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hot in her world sharing this</font>

130
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,860
information again<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

131
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,380
cannon it's up to us like we make cannon

132
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,180
cannon is made by us is not made by the

133
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around the book that's not like a</font>

134
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,510
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens of its own accord</font>

135
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,430
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we participate in it's</font>

136
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,780
something that we create and that's

137
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,310
something that I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

138
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,959
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next few months because I've</font>

139
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,630
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking a lot about how my</font>

140
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,160
curation of

141
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,250
50 book book collection is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a process</font>

142
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of destruction it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of throwing</font>

143
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,180
things away the process of creation

144
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,640
putting things together and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

145
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,410
making something new whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

146
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,150
Hermione and Ron ended up together we

147
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,560
should have ended up together what are

148
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">we saying about her opinion I just don't</font>

149
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,210
buy a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conversations at least</font>

150
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,220
that happened around this piece of dues

151
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,320
but basically leave JK Rowling alone

152
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,360
just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> last point a few people kind of</font>

153
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,460
in line a little bit with that woman who

154
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,260
wrote on Huffington Post that JK Rowling

155
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,580
should never write another book and give

156
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,200
one else<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance a lot people said that</font>

157
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,490
JK Rowling should just not express

158
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,900
opinions about how watch anymore but

159
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,970
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really unfair exactly like that I</font>

160
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,470
just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want that to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the case I</font>

161
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,820
want every author to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to talk</font>

162
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">about their own work without us like</font>

163
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">privilege doing it above everything else</font>

164
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,860
anyway that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> promise hopefully</font>

165
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,540
that I will make three videos this week

166
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,190
rather than like the two video weak

167
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,650
trend but you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> its Creed a busy</font>

168
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,430
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> next n22 and I saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high again when</font>

169
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,380
bouldering there's terrible idea because

170
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,020
I'm bad at it it really hurts oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

171
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,370
read a book that I can't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

172
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,070
about you know like it's a busy life if

173
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're new to this channel I technically</font>

174
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">make videos every Monday Wednesday</font>

175
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,150
Friday but sometimes that goes a little

176
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,010
