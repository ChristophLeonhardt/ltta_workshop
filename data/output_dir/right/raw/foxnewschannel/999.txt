1
00:00:01,636 --> 00:00:03,371
POINT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:06,307
IT'S ON THE PATH OF BEING

3
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:06,741
IRREVERSIBLE.

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:09,177
>> Dana: THANKS, JOHN.

5
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:12,813
HAVE A SAFE TRIP HOME.

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:16,784
JOINING US NOW, SUE MI TERRY, AN

7
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,586
ANALYST ON THE KOREAN ISSUES FOR

8
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:20,021
THE CIA.

9
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,423
SHE'S HERE FOR NO POLITICS, JUST

10
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:22,790
SUBSTANCE.

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,091
TELL ME ABOUT THE HISTORICAL

12
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,826
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS MOMENT?

13
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,628
>> IT'S HISTORICALLY

14
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,630
SIGNIFICANT, THIS IS THE FIRST

15
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,032
TIME A SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT

16
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,767
SAT DOWN WITH A NORTH KOREAN

17
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,068
LEADER FACE TO FACE.

18
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,170
WE NEVER HAD THAT.

19
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,905
OTHER TIMES NORTH KOREAN LEADERS

20
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,107
WANTED THIS, BUT OTHER --

21
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,342
PRESIDENT BUSH AND OBAMA DIDN'T

22
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:42,843
WANT TO DO THAT.

23
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,412
SO THIS IS HISTORIC.

24
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,614
REGARDLESS OF WHAT OCCURRED.

25
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,449
THIS MOMENT IS -- WHAT WE

26
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,850
WITNESSED YESTERDAY IS A

27
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,651
HISTORIC MOMENT.

28
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,153
>> Dana: YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT

29
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:54,121
ABOUT KIM JONG-UN AND THE

30
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:54,488
CULTURE.

31
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,457
YOU MENTIONED IN A PIECE TODAY

32
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,459
THAT HE SHOWED DEFERENCE TO HIS

33
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,460
OTHER COUNTERPART.

34
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,328
HOW SO?

35
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,964
>> HE'S BEING VERY CORDIAL.

36
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:04,364
IN KOREAN LANGUAGE, THERE'S

37
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,900
FORMAL AND INFORMAL LANGUAGE.

38
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,902
HE USED FORMAL LANGUAGE WHEN

39
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:08,903
ADDRESSING PRESIDENT TRUMP.

40
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:14,508
HIS BODY LANGUAGE, HE DIDN'T

41
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,943
HAVE AN ALTITUDE.

42
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,979
HE TRIED TO GIVE RESPECT TO

43
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:18,312
TRUMP.

44
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,080
>> Dana: WHAT DO YOU THINK STATE

45
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,682
TV WANTS THOSE CITIZENS TO SEE?

46
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,184
>> WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE

47
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,318
ALL THE THINGS THAT KIM JONG-UN

48
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,887
WAS DOING, RUNNING AROUND

49
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,122
SINGAPORE, TAKING A SELFIE.

50
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,191
YOU KNOW THE NORTH KOREAN MEDIA

51
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:30,925
WAS WITH HIM.

52
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,861
THE WAY THEY'RE GOING TO SPIN

53
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:37,665
IT, NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR

54
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:39,433
PROGRAM IS COMPLETED AND NOW THE

55
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,668
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS

56
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:41,235
ACCEPTING HIM.

57
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,637
NOW YOU CAN SIT DOWN WITH

58
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,438
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE MOST

59
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,275
POWERFUL PRESIDENT IN THE WORLD.

60
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:47,541
WHY?

61
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,943
BECAUSE KIM JONG-UN IS A BOLD

62
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,545
LEADER THAT GETS HERE BECAUSE --

63
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,580
>> Dana: THEY KNOW IT'S BECAUSE

64
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,315
KIM JONG-UN HAS SAID THAT HE

65
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,716
WOULD DENUCLEARIZE?

66
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,718
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL KNOW

67
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:58,619
THAT.

68
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,055
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW, WE,

69
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:01,756
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH

70
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:03,491
KOREA, ARE GOING TO TRY TO

71
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,326
IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP AND TRY

72
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,460
TO GET TO ANOTHER LEVEL.

73
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,895
BUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO THINK

74
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,798
IS THAT NOW BECAUSE NORTH KOREA

75
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,932
COMPLETED THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM,

76
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,334
THEY'RE ABLE TO SIT DOWN WITH

77
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,737
THE U.S. PRESIDENT AND NEGOTIATE

78
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,973
FROM POSITION OF STRENGTH.

79
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,808
>> THEY'RE EQUALS.

80
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:21,842
>> THAT'S THEIR NARRATIVE.

81
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,177
>> Dana: TELL ME GOING FORWARD.

82
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,046
WE KNOW JOHN BOLTON WILL BE

83
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:27,148
GOING OVER IN ABOUT A MONTH AND

84
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,317
WORK ON THE NITTY GRITTY WITH

85
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:29,750
MIKE POMPEO.

86
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,886
THEY'LL HAVE TO BE TOUGHER, I

87
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:32,219
ASSUME?

88
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,220
>> ABSOLUTELY.

89
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,755
THIS JOINT STATEMENT, IT WAS

90
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,358
LARGELY ASPIRATIONAL.

91
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,327
DIDN'T ADDRESS AT ALL NORTH

92
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:49,403
KOREA

93
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,967
>> Sandra: TAKE A LISTEN TO

94
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,235
PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT

95
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,669
HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHAT HAPPENED

96
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,371
YESTERDAY AT THE SUMMIT.

97
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,140
>> I BELIEVE IT'S A ROUGH

98
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,907
SITUATION OVER THERE.

99
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,575
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

100
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,411
WE DID DISCUSS IT TODAY.

101
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,612
PRETTY STRONGLY.

102
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,447
KNOWING WHAT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF

103
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:10,484
WHAT WE WERE DOING IS, DENUKING.

104
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,487
BUT DISCUSSED IT AT GOOD LENGTH.

105
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,823
WE'LL BE DOING SOMETHING ON IT.

106
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,625
>> Sandra: THIS WON'T BE A

107
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,125
SURPRISE TO YOU.

108
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,392
THE HUNGER CRISIS IN NORTH

109
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:19,793
KOREA.

110
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,462
18 MILLION PEOPLE ARE DEPENDENT

111
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:24,198
ON GOVERNMENT FOOD RATIONS.

112
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:29,503
10.5 MILLION ARE BELIEVED TO BE

113
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:29,970
UNDERNOURISHED.

114
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,106
I MEAN, IN ANY WAY, DO YOU THINK

115
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,507
THAT KIM JONG-UN GETTING A TASTE

116
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,143
OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE TO BE A

117
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,245
NORMALIZED LEADER IN A WORLD

118
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:41,415
THAT HE MIGHT TREAT HIS PEOPLE

119
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:41,816
BETTER?

120
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,317
>> I'M SKEPTICAL ON THAT.

121
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,218
I'M HOPEFUL.

122
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,519
I FEEL LIKE THAT IS SOMETHING

123
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,354
THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE

124
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:47,755
FUTURE.

125
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,156
YEAH, HE WANTS TO IMPROVE THE

126
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,057
ECONOMY FOR NORTH KOREA.

127
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:53,194
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE A

128
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:55,496
RULER OF A POOR STATE.

129
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,498
JUST FOR HIMSELF,

130
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,032
SELF-INTEREST-WISE.

131
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,133
I'M SKEPTICAL THAT HE WILL OPEN

132
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:03,170
THE PRISON CAMPS THAT HAS

133
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,840
ALL OF A SUDDEN TAKE CARE OF THE

134
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,508
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.

135
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,211
I'M SKEPTICAL OF THAT.

136
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,179
NORTH KOREA SPENDS BILLIONS

137
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,514
PURSUING THE NUCLEAR WEAPON

138
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,282
WHILE WATCHING THEIR PEOPLE

139
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:15,616
STARVE.

140
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,651
IN THE 90s, THEY SPENT $800

141
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,654
MILLION BUILDING A MAUSOLEUM FOR

142
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,322
KIM JONG-UN.

143
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,224
PEOPLE LITERALLY DYING AND

144
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:23,591
STARVING.

145
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:24,992
SO MAYBE -- KIM JONG-UN DOES

146
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,394
WANT TO I THINK IMPROVE HIS

147
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,363
ECONOMY BUT TO SAY HE'S GOING TO

148
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,799
CHANGE THE HUMAN RIGHTS

149
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,267
SITUATION AROUND --

150
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,869
>> Sandra: CAN I ASK ONE LAST

151
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:35,269
QUESTION?

152
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,937
AT THE END OF THE SUMMIT, YOU

153
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,472
THINK THE UNITED STATES AND THE

154
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,508
WORLD IS SAFER THAN IT WAS

155
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:40,841
BEFORE?

156
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,343
>> I DO THINK SO.

157
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,145
JUST BECAUSE IT'S BETTER THAN

158
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,848
TALKING ABOUT PREVENTATIVE

159
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,883
STRIKE AND BLOODY NOSE.

160
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,318
WHILE IT'S NOT IDEAL, IT'S A

161
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,319
FLAWED STATEMENT BECAUSE IT WAS

162
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,755
A VERY ASPIRATIONAL AND NORTH

163
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,890
KOREANS COULD HAVE GIVEN US

164
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,190
MORE.

165
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,925
BUT THIS IS STILL BETTER TODAY

166
00:05:57,925 --> 00:00:00,000
THAN WHERE WE WERE A FEW WEEKS
