Rachel Notley has rehired her former chief of staff John Heaney for yet another government gig but she hid it from you and today I'll tell you why John Haney was Rachel not least chief of staff but he resigned to last August claiming that he had a strong desire to be with his family in British Columbia let's go back a little go and talk about John Heaney's most notable time here in Alberta according to internal emails discovered by the United Conservative Party in 2016 Heaney wanted service Alberta bureaucrats to change information that would be released under Freedom of Information requests now that discovery triggered the privacy commissioners investigation into Heaney's actions beginning in 2017 now all this happened after yet another privacy investigation was triggered when the government mast deleted about 800,000 government documents putting Hillary Clinton to shame but that desire to spend quality time with Keeley's family lasted only about two months that's right Heaney wasn't hired back this month after his sabbatical in British Columbia oh no friends Heaney was hired back by the NDP in October 2017 to become an executive advisor in the Finance Ministry so he was gone in August and back in Albert in October so from there in April his responsibilities were expanded to include advising the energy ministry strangely he me was not listed in the government worker directory but his employment was eventually confirmed to the Edmonton Journal in May of 2018 by energy press secretary jean-marc Prevost what this all means is that when news broke in November 2017 about the role Heaney was alleged to have played in the 2016 Freedom of Information request meddling Heaney had already been rehired by the Alberta government for about a month and the Alberta government never divulged that information to the media during any of their questions about heaney and remember it was never listed on the government website that he me was again an Alberta government employee by Rachel notley's lack of transparency about her rehire of John Heaney by keeping his rehire hush-hush and on the down-low Namie insulated herself from the fallout about the political meddling because as far as anybody knew the scapegoat in the scandal Heaney didn't work for the government anymore this is really really slippery stuff but it gets worse now this week during the time he me was rehired by the Alberta government unbeknownst to everybody except the government Heaney was also working as a registered lobbyist in British Columbia according to the lobbyists registry in British Columbia Heaney was lobbying the BC government for shoppers Drug Mart Loblaw companies and new Vera Corporation which is of course a marijuana company now Alberta's opposition is concerned that this breaks a code of conduct for government employees that prohibits government employees from engaging in any business or undertaking other than his or her employment with the Alberta government without exemption now one would reasonably think that being a registered lobbyist in another province logging that government in another province while working for the province of Alberta would violate that code of conduct but conveniently Rachel not least communications director Cheryl Oates said that he Neha's an exemption so I guess we're all just supposed to be okay with the double-dipping and this isn't the first time that he Neha's been in trouble for lobbying when he worked for the NDP so he really really should know better by now in 2007 John Heaney was part of a law firm that was retained by the BC NDP during that time Heaney was also a registered lobbyist for the Canadian generic pharmaceutical Association so he's working for the NDP as a lawyer but also a registered lobbyist for the Canadian generic pharmaceutical Association so far that doesn't break the law what does come in contravention of the law is when Heaney was working for the NDP as a lawyer he also lobbied the BC NDP health critic at the same time that man was Adrian Dix so yeah Heaney has been around a long time doing a lot of this double dipping and using his influence with the NDP either as they sit in opposition or in government to lobby for his clients at the exact same time he knees lining his pockets twice he needs a longtime friend of BC premier John Horgan he was chief of staff to BC premier Horgan when Horgan was in opposition Heaney is also reported to have been Horgan's business partner in his former lobbying firm and yet according to the spokesperson for the energy ministry Heaney has been tasked with providing legal advice related to pipelines and market access working specifically on the trans mountain expansion file what kind of message do you think it sends to Kinder Morgan when Rachel Notley rehires Horgan's troubled besty to provide advice to the energy Ministry on the Kinder Morgan pipeline was there nobody else in Alberta who is remotely qualified to work as an executive advisor in the finance department and then in the Energy Department this is a level of cronyism and political familial nepotism the likes of which the former PC government in
