THERE WAS A
LIGHTHEARTED, HILARIOUS MOMENT
ON INSIDE THE NBA WITH CHARLES
BARKLEY WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE
EFFECTS OF TRICKLE-DOWN
ECONOMICS NOW THAT THERE IS A
NEW TAX CUT.
TAKE A LOOK.
>>DON'T FORGET ABOUT CHRISTMAS
PRESENTS.
>>WE WILL DO THAT ON INSIDE THE
NBA.
>>THIS WILL BE MY SECOND ONE
THIS WEEK, MY SECOND BIG GIFT.
>>WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST ONE?
>>THAT REPUBLICAN TAX CUT.
I WAS
GOING TO SAY, SHAQ, THEY SAID IT
WOULD TRICKLE-DOWN, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?
>>YOU WERE ON A ROLL.
>>I'M GOING TO TRICKLE MY FAT
ASS DOWN TO THE JEWELRY STORE TO
GET A NEW ROLEX, I'M NOT GOING
TO PASS IT DOWN TO ANYBODY.
THANK YOU, REPUBLICANS.
SORRY
POOR PEOPLE, I'M HOPING FOR YOU
ALL BUT Y'ALL AIN'T GOT NO
CHANCE.
>>THAT'S WHY I LOVE CHARLES
BARKLEY.
>>THEY DIDN'T EVEN RECONSTITUTE
TRICKLE-DOWN IN THE PITCH, IT'S
BEEN PROVEN WRONG FOR DECADES
BUT STILL YOU HEAR IT, IT'S THE
WAY. AND CHARLES BARKLEY,
HASHTAG TRUTH.
>>IT'S BECOME A PUNCHLINE AND
THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT.
THAT
IS WHY THIS BILL IS POLLING AT
AROUND 30%, WHICH IS IN CREDIT
WE UNPOPULAR.
AND BARKLEY WAS A
REPUBLICAN FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE
UNTIL GEORGE W. BUSH,
SIGNIFICANTLY INTO BUSH'S
FIRST TERM.
WHEN HE WAS ASKED
BACK IN THE DAY WHY ARE YOU A
REPUBLICAN, HE SAID HIS
GRANDMOTHER ASKED HIM, HIS
GRANDMOTHER SAID CHARLES, WHY
ARE YOU A REPUBLICAN?
THEY ARE
ONLY FOR THE RICH.
HE'S LIKE,
GRANDMA, I AM RICH.
AND DURING
THE BUSH ERA THE ASKED HIM WHAT
IS YOUR PROBLEM, YOU WERE ALWAYS
PRO BEING RICH -- HE'S LIKE,
YEAH, I WAS WITH THE REPUBLICANS
UNTIL THEY WENT NUTS AND LOST
THEIR MINDS.
BY THE WAY, THE
SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.
WE
ARE GOING TO IRAQ?
TORCHING
PEOPLE?
OKAY, CHARLES WANTS
ANOTHER ROLEX BUT DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO TORTURE ANYONE ABOUT IT.
HERE HE'S BEING LIGHTHEARTED AS
BRETT SAID BUT HE DRIVES THE
POINT HOME.
YOU AREN'T GOING TO
GET ANYTHING, BUT CHARLES
BARKLEY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE
RICH REPUBLICAN DONORS WILL GET
ROLEXES AND YACHTS AND IT ISN'T
GOING TO TRICKLE DOWN ON YOU
EXCEPT IN THE WAY YOU IMAGINE.
