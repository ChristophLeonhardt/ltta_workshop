here's the former President of Mexico Vicente Fox who said Donald Trump your mouth is the foul list shithole in the world with what authority do you proclaim who's welcome in America and who's not America's greatness is built on diversity or have you forgotten your immigrant background Donald and of course the answer is the US Constitution gives the US President and Congress the authority to decide who gets to come to America and who doesn't and America is much more generous for example that Mexico is but Fox and so many other critics of Trump really just swore back at him didn't they so it's not like they believe in civility just like CNN they're not actually mad the Trump said a bad word they're not truly shocked either in fact they love it because it gives them some sort of political license to say it a dozen times in return the New York Daily News used the opportunity to publish a picture of Trump as a pile of manure so you know they are very dainty and don't like to be neat look their New Yorkers this is how New Yorkers talk now I should note and I think it's important the Donald Trump says he was misquoted here's what he said on Twitter he said the language used by me at the daka meeting was tough but this was not the language used what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for daca now I have no idea what he said frankly I find it credible that he swore I mean Trump swears he's a New Yorker he gives people nicknames he speaks bluntly he's not politically correct it's a reason the people love him and it's a reason people hate him I often say take Trump seriously don't take him literally as in he uses flourishes and hyperbole as a style he's in new york empresario he's a TV guys a tabloid newspaper guy take him seriously but don't take him too literally that's that's my way of decoding Trump so let's do that here he's asking why is America taking people from the world's worst country's worst economically worst in terms of Crom worst in terms of cultural fit worst in terms of Education he said because he's a blue-collar billionaire so instead of sounding professorial he's shortened that whole list of things - the word shithole countries that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
