our White House handlers didn't even wait a second shouting reporters out of the Oval Office before the president could be tempted to answer questions Donald Trump stayed silent Tuesday the night before was a different story going on a long rant about the raid on his lawyer Michael Cohen's hotel an office why don't I just fire mama well I think it's a disgrace what's going on we'll see what happens but I think it's really a sad situation when you look at what happened and many people have said you should fire him that is giving Democrats ammunition to call for new legislation this Congress must respond forcefully and on a bipartisan basis by reaffirming our belief that the president cannot fire special counsel without law without cause and by passing legislation to ensure that any attempts to remove Robert Muller will be unsuccessful so far Republicans have only gone as far as to warn the president not to act but he is tweeting calling it a witch-hunt and posting attorney-client privilege is dead it actually isn't but that's what makes the raid on Cohen so surprising investigators and judges very rarely subpoena attorneys in order to get a judge to sign off the rules say that they have to have evidence that the attorney and his or her clients are actively committing a crime and it has to be signed off on at the highest levels of the Justice Department at the White House in insistence the president has the power to fire the special counsel I know a number of individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of Justice said he has the power to do so most experts believe that is not true the president can't directly fire Special Counsel Robert Muller but he could try to force the Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein to do it if he won't try to replace him with someone who will or he could replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions with someone willing to close the special counsel's office that would provoke a constitutional crisis putting pressure on Congress to step in potentially giving Muller even more power and money to pursue his case that President Trump clearly feels is getting closer to him by the day Patti Colleen al-jazeera Washington
