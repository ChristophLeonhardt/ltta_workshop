This was a wonderful place
for a lot of people to come to.
It was straight and gay and
it was a great place for
people to come and dance and
have fun and be safe.
Who would have thought?
One man's hate is
tripley undone by
a million people from around
the world's message of love.
We all deserve to be loved
and to show love.
It's my community.
I watched some of the people in this
town, who maybe hated,
maybe tolerated, come around.
And I think they learned from
this that we're all human.
We will never forget our loved ones.
We will never forgive what happened
here that night, but we
will try to heal.
