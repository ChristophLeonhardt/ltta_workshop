you need to know sign I've always loved
you I think about you constantly I know
I'm not a perfect dad I know I wasn't
able to give you everything you wanted
it's one of my deepest regrets but I
give everything I have for you I still
remember the day you were born I still
remember when we play catch together I
remember when we just talked your some
of my best days I want to miss some of
that I've watched you grow up I've seen
you in your happiest moments when I was
with you and your moments of sadness I
know your tendency is to get angry
there are times you get self-centered
but I can't make me love you nice talk
dad you don't need to stay up with me to
kiss me duh why are you always touching
oh you're done
you
you need a gun yes we will D what are
you doing stop it stop you're right
bilges I know dad's gotta run
what are you doing stop
I believe in you son
what you did in the past it's okay my
love for you will not change
there were so many sleepless nights that
I waited for you
there was hurt and pain I'm sure you
didn't see there was distance in silence
that we both experienced but they can
diminish my desire to see you
I've always loved you I never thought
once I would leave you
you
I'll never stop being your father to
know that
and I want you to know that this is what
I want because that means you get a
second chance to live a second chance to
live
you mean more to me than life itself I
give my life a thousand times for you
son I will always love you because I'll
never stop being your father and you'll
always be my son
