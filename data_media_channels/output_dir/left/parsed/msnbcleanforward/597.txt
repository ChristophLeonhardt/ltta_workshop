I mean this is the greatest evening and
here it is Bill Cosby walking out of the
courtroom in handcuffs it seems that the
judge did want to put him in front of
camera so that cameras could see what
happens to a man when he's been found
guilty of of what he did Andrea constant
and of all the horrible things he did to
her drugging and sexually assaulting her
sorry sometimes it's hard to get your
mind around some of those excruciating
ly horrible allegations Bill Cosby
remanded to County Jail will serve three
to ten years in prison
