1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,540
TODAY, MIKE FLYNN PLED GUILTY
TO LYING TO THE FBI, HE WAS

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,790
FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
TO DONALD TRUMP, WE HAVE TALKED

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,049
ABOUT ALL THE CHARGES HE FACED
IN ANOTHER PORTION OF THE SHOW

4
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:17,689
AND HOW HE TOOK A PLEA DEAL ON A
SMALL CHARGE, MEANING HE'S GOING

5
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:22,490
TO GIVE OVER WHAT APPEARS TO BE
A LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,970
OTHER PEOPLE TO INVESTIGATOR
ROBERT MUELLER, THE SPECIAL

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,560
COUNSEL, OTHERWISE HE WOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN THAT PLEA DEAL.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
SO

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,280
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
CONSEQUENCES FOR DONALD TRUMP,

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,430
AND THERE'S SEVERAL LAYERS TO
THIS.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,800
NUMBER ONE, SOME IN THE

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,120
PRESS BEFORE TODAY WERE
SPECULATING THAT, WELL, MAYBE

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,070
THE INVESTIGATION WILL LEAD UP
TO MANAFORT AND FLYNN AND THAT'S

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,410
IT.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,040
NOW, WE ARE DONE WITH THAT,
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,370
COMICAL -- WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT GETTING FLYNN?

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,570
AND IF IT

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,140
TURNS OUT THAT ALL MUELLER HAD
WAS FLYNN LYING ABOUT HIS

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,740
CONTACTS WITH THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR, OKAY, MAYBE HE DOES

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,020
SOME PRISON TIME AND WE ARE DONE
WITH THAT, THEN IT TURNS OUT

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,170
TRUMP WAS NOT GUILTY IF THAT'S
ALL THEY COULD GET.

22
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,170
BUT NOW THAT

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,469
MUELLER HAS GIVEN HIM A PLEA
DEAL, THAT MEANS FLYNN HAS

24
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,829
SOMETHING ON SOMEONE HIGHER UP,
OTHERWISE THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE

25
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,649
LET HIM GO WHEN HE WAS FACING AT
LEAST 60 YEARS IN PRISON ON

26
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,509
OTHER CHARGES THAT THEY DIDN'T
CHARGE HIM WITH.

27
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:26,530
SO THAT ERNEST

28
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,020
CONVERSATION SOME IN THE MEDIA
HAD ABOUT MAYBE IT'S JUST FLYNN

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,009
AND NOT TRUMP, WE ARE DONE WITH
THAT.

30
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,539
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY

31
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,679
WILL DEFINITELY GET TRUMP, IT'S
TO SAY THEY ARE GOING FOR PEOPLE

32
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,679
HIGHER THAN FLYNN.

33
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:39,540
AND FLYNN WAS
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THERE

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,409
WEREN'T MANY PEOPLE HIGHER THAN
HIM.

35
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,829
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS KUSHNER,

36
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,950
MAYBE PENCE, BUT HE LIED TO
PENCE, THEN THERE IS TRUMP.

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,760
>>KUSHNER SORT OF TECHNICALLY,
THERE IS A STRAIGHT LINE FROM

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,570
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO THE
PRESIDENT.

39
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,770
>>IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS
THE SON-IN-LAW IS NOT IN THAT

40
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:06,109
LINE, IT'S ABSURD THAT WE ARE IN
THIS CONVERSATION BUT WE LIVE IN

41
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,899
ABSURD TIMES.

42
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,650
THE OTHER THINGS
RELATE TO DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT

43
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,900
WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR
QUITE SOME TIME, ONE IS

44
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,910
COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS.

45
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,600
THERE ARE VARYING DEGREES OF

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,841
COLLUSION, IT COULD HAVE BEEN AS
FLYNN HAS BASICALLY ALREADY

47
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:26,610
ADMITTED TO IN THEIR TRANSITION,
AFTER THE CAMPAIGN, BUT BEFORE

48
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,330
THE ADMINISTRATION BEGINS, IN
THAT INTERREGNUM, IF YOU WILL,

49
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,950
HE TALKED TO THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR, APPARENTLY A LOT OF

50
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,930
PEOPLE THERE, JEFF SESSIONS, A
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE PART OF

51
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,920
TRUMP'S TEAM, AND THAT COLLUSION
BEFORE THEY TAKE OFFICE.

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
THAT IS

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,470
THE SMALLEST POSSIBILITY.

54
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,760
THE
OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT THEY

55
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,930
COLLUDED WITH RUSSIANS DURING
THE CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS A BIG

56
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,010
DEAL AND WOULD BE A MUCH HEAVIER
CHARGE.

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,010
WHAT WOULD BE THE WORST

58
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,020
IS IF THEY ARE CONTINUING TO
COLLUDE WITH THE RUSSIANS DURING

59
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,450
THE ADMINISTRATION, WHEN HE IS
PRESIDENT.

60
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,450
WHAT WOULD BE A

61
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,810
COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS
ALONG THOSE LINES?

62
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,090
WELL, WE

63
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,330
WON'T DO THE SANCTIONS, YOU
HELPED US WITH THE ELECTION,

64
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,780
THAT IS ONE POSSIBILITY, THANK
YOU FOR THAT, FOR MAKING ME

65
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,820
PRESIDENT, SO I WON'T ENFORCE
THE SANCTIONS.

66
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,240
TRUMP HAD TO SIGN

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,250
FURTHER SANCTIONS INTO PLACE AND
KEEP THE OLD SANCTIONS BECAUSE

68
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,770
THE SENATE VOTED 98-2 IN FAVOR
OF THOSE SANCTIONS, SO HE KNEW

69
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,780
THAT EVEN IF HE VETOED IT IT
WOULD BE OVERWRITTEN.

70
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,780
BUT SINCE

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,810
HE HAS SIGNED IT HE HASN'T
ENFORCED IT, THE SANCTIONS ARE

72
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,470
NOT BEING ENFORCED ON RUSSIA.

73
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,930
SO
THAT IS YOUR DEAL, THAT IS YOUR

74
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,930
COLLUSION.

75
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,990
SO THAT'S A
POSSIBILITY.

76
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,160
THE SECOND LAYER IS

77
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,600
OBJECTION.

78
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,020
HE KNOWS THAT FLYNN
HAS SOME MATERIAL ON HIM, HE

79
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,000
TELLS COMEY TO DROP THE
INVESTIGATION ON FLYNN AFTER HE

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,050
TELLS EVERONE ELSE TO GET OUT OF
THE ROOM, THAT HE TOLD LESTER

81
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,140
HOLT ON NATIONAL TV THAT HE
FIRED COMEY BECAUSE OF THE

82
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,700
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, THAT
COMEY, HEAD OF THE FBI, WAS

83
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,590
DOING, THAT ALSO OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.

84
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,590
AND NOW THAT FLYNN IS

85
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,480
COOPERATING WITH THE AUTHORITIES
THAN HE CAN TELL THEM YES, TRUMP

86
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,140
WAS SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS,
INCLUDING TELLING ME TO WAIT FOR

87
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,841
IMMUNITY, BECAUSE THIS IS THE
INFORMATION I HAD ON HIM THAT HE

88
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:13,500
DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT, THAT
ALLOWS MUELLER YOU WERE TRYING

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,629
TO BLOCK THAT INFORMATION,
THAT'S OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE --

90
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:20,009
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH.

91
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,639
THE
COLLUSION, IF IT'S IN THE

92
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,310
INTERREGNUM, PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH
TO GET TRUMP OUT.

93
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,310
COLLUSION

94
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,249
WHILE HE'S PRESIDENT, DEFINITELY
ENOUGH TO GET HIM OUT.

95
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,249
IF YOU

96
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:32,249
CAN PROVE IT.

97
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,941
DURING THE
CAMPAIGN, I GOT THAT AT 50-50, I

98
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,689
KNOW EVERY DEMOCRAT AND EVERYONE
AT MSNBC AND EVERYONE ON TV

99
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:41,389
THINKS IF HE DID COLLUSION WITH
THE RUSSIANS TRY TO GET

100
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,110
HILLARY'S EMAILS HE WILL BE
IMPEACHED, I'M NOT CONVINCED OF

101
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,080
THAT, I THINK THAT'S 50-50.

102
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
THAT
IS WHAT THEY THINK IS THE

103
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,169
END-ALL, BE-ALL.

104
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,999
I THINK THAT'S
THE SMALLEST THING HE DID,

105
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,120
POTENTIALLY, IN THIS ENTIRE
AFFAIR.

106
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,939
OBSTRUCTION IS A CLEAR,

107
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,870
CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE LAW.

108
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,720
>>THAT IS WHAT NIXON WAS GOING
DOWN FOR.

109
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,289
>>THAT'S RIGHT, NIXON WAS GOING
TO BE IMPEACHED, AND THAT'S WHY

110
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,590
HE RESIGNED.

111
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,310
BUT THERE'S A
FOURTH LAYER NO ONE IS TALKING

112
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,000
ABOUT, THAT WE TALK ABOUT ON THE
SHOW ALL THE TIME.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THE FOURTH

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,490
LAYER IS THE REASON HE'S NOT
DOING THE SANCTIONS IS THAT

115
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:26,789
TRUMP HAS HAD A DEAL WITH THE
RUSSIANS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

116
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:31,460
NOW, I DON'T KNOW -- IF WE ARE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT, AND IN OUR

117
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,780
THEORY IT'S A FINANCIAL DEAL --
I'VE GOT DOZENS OF PIECES OF

118
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,759
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE I'VE
TALKED ABOUT FOR MONTHS, THEY

119
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,310
ARE ALL OUT OF THE OPEN, BUT
WHAT YOU NEED IS A SMOKING GUN.

120
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,770
SOMEONE THAT KNOWS ABOUT THAT
DEAL TO TALK ABOUT IT TO

121
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,699
MUELLER, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL,
ETC. IS FLYNN THAT GUY?

122
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:53,949
WE DON'T

123
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:54,949
KNOW.

124
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:59,240
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IF
THAT DEAL EVEN EXISTS, OR IF IT

125
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,729
DOES IF FLYNN KNOWS ABOUT IT.

126
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,879
BUT IF FLYNN KNOWS ABOUT IT, IT

127
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,270
DOESN'T APPEAR PAPADOPOULOS DOES
-- OR IF MANAFORT KNOWS ABOUT IT

128
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,659
AND HE FLIPS BECAUSE FLYNN
FLIPPED, OH BOY.

129
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:16,659
NOT ONLY IS

130
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:22,560
THAT HE'S DEFINITELY GONE, IF
THEY WANTED TO PURSUE IT, IT'S

131
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,719
PRETTY MUCH TREASON.

132
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:26,249
THEY COULD
PUT HIM IN PRISON.

133
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:27,249
THEY PROBABLY

134
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:29,509
WON'T, IT'S TOO EMBARRASSING FOR
THE COUNTRY, THEY WILL CLAIM HE

135
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,419
HAS ALZHEIMER'S, HE'LL RESIGNED
IMMEDIATELY.

136
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:33,139
>>THERE IS EVIDENCE TO THAT.

137
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,229
>>THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE FOR
THAT.

138
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:41,740
BUT THAT IS THE MOTHER

139
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,740
LODE.

140
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,050
>>FOR ME THE POSSIBLE FINANCIAL
DEALS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND

141
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,110
YOU ARE RIGHT, THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

142
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,370
ABOUT THAT IN THE MEDIA,
PARTICULARLY THE MAINSTREAM

143
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,259
MEDIA, AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
OR NOT THAT IS ANY PART OF

144
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,779
MUELLER'S FOCUS.

145
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,779
I WOULD HOPE
THAT IT IS.

146
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:00,779
BECAUSE HERE IS THE

147
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:07,759
THING -- IF COLLUSION IS PROVEN,
WHY WOULD RUSSIA CARE SO DEEPLY

148
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,460
ABOUT GETTING TRUMP ELECTED?

149
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,199
NOW, IT COULD BE ABOUT THE

150
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,629
SANCTIONS, BUT IT COULD ALSO BE
ABOUT OTHER THINGS THAT RUSSIA

151
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,710
WANTS, OTHER FAVORS RUSSIA
WANTS, AND ALSO WHY WOULD TRUMP

152
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,960
RISK EVERYTHING TO DO THAT?

153
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,560
WHY
IS HE SO FRIENDLY FOR THE

154
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,919
RUSSIANS?

155
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,479
WHY DOES HE HAVE A
SOFT SPOT FOR PUTIN?

156
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,380
>>WHEN HE DOESN'T HAVE A SOFT
SPOT FOR ANYONE ELSE APPARENTLY.

157
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,699
WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT IS CLEAR,
THE SANCTIONS ARE COSTING THEM

158
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:41,300
TRILLION DOLLARS, THERE IS A
$500 BILLION DEAL WITH EXXON

159
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,089
MOBIL, OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON
IN THEIR MINDS BLOCKED IT, OBAMA

160
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:49,839
DEFINITELY DID -- I GET WHY THEY
WANT TO OPPOSE THE DEMOCRATS AND

161
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,969
HILLARY CLINTON, I GET WHAT THE
RUSSIANS WANT, THEY WANT THE

162
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:53,039
SANCTIONS LIFTED.

163
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,400
THE QUESTION
IS, WHY DOES TRUMP CARE SO MUCH

164
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,009
ABOUT WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT?

165
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,559
OKAY, THE FRENCH WANT THAT,

166
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,599
THE COLOMBIANS WANT THAT, BUT
WHY DOES TRUMP CARE SO MUCH

167
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:17,150
ABOUT WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT?

168
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,339
HE
MADE THE DECISION TO BRING ALL

169
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:21,749
THESE GUYS ONTO HIS CAMPAIGN
EARLY ON, MANAFORT, ETC., BEFORE

170
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:29,790
ANY OF THE SO-CALLED COLLUSION
ABOUT HILLARY'S EMAILS, ETC.

171
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,790
WHY

172
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,740
STACK YOUR TEAM FULL OF RUSSIAN
ALLIES IN THE FIRST PLACE?

173
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,779
AND

174
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,500
TO US WHAT IS A LOGICAL ANSWER,
BUT AGAIN THE AUTHORITIES WILL

175
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,400
HAVE TO SEE, AND I HOPE THEY ARE
LOOKING INTO IT, IS THAT HE

176
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,320
ALREADY OWED THE RUSSIANS, AND
THAT'S WHY THE RUSSIANS THOUGHT

177
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,940
NOT ONLY DO WE GET TO KNOCKDOWN
HILLARY CLINTON, WE GET A GUY

178
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,610
WHO IS IN OUR BACK POCKET TO
BECOME PRESIDENT TO LIFT THE

179
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,610
SANCTIONS.

180
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,690
>>ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL

181
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,029
DOCUMENTS, AND THIS ISN'T A
FLYNN THING, ALTHOUGH I THINK

182
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:01,170
FLYNN IS WELL-PLACED TO GIVE
INFORMATION ON LONG-STANDING

183
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,350
DEALS WITH RUSSIA -- BUT THE
THING THAT MUELLER NEEDS IS THE

184
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,350
TAX RETURNS.

185
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,620
I DON'T KNOW IF HE
CAN GET THEM, I ASSUME HE CAN --

186
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
THAT SEEMS IMPORTANT.

187
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,959
>>I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE
TAX RETURNS BECAUSE THAT'S YET

188
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,329
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRUMP NOT
BEING FORTHCOMING AND I DON'T

189
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:21,149
UNDERSTAND WHY, BECAUSE HE IS
THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL WHO LOVES

190
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:22,750
TO FLAUNT HOW WEALTHY HE IS.

191
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,089
MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT TO RELEASE

192
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:27,529
THE TAX RETURNS BECAUSE HE'S NOT
AS WEALTHY AS HE SAYS, THAT

193
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:32,509
WOULD EMBARRASS HIM, BUT THERE'S
ALSO THE ISSUE OF HIM GOING

194
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,329
BANKRUPT IN THE UNITED STATES SO
MANY TIMES THAT LENDERS IN THE

195
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:40,320
U.S., BANKS IN THE U.S., REFUSED
TO LEND HIM MORE MONEY SO HE HAD

196
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,250
TO GO TO OTHER BANKS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO GET THE

197
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,050
LOANS NECESSARY TO BUILD HIS
DEVELOPMENTS AND CONTINUE WITH

198
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,050
HIS BUSINESS.

199
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,930
HOW MANY OF THOSE
LOANS CAME FROM RUSSIA?

200
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,930
HOW MUCH

201
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,930
DOES HE OWE RUSSIA?

202
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,500
IS THAT
PLAYING A ROLE IN POSSIBLE

203
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
COLLUSION?

204
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,139
ALL OF THOSE THINGS I
THINK ARE RELEVANT AND I HOPE

205
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,540
THERE IS MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON
THAT IN MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION,

206
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,990
WE KNOW THERE IS NO EMPHASIS ON
THAT IN THE MEDIA BUT THAT

207
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,870
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT BEING
INVESTIGATED.

208
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,000
>>I FEEL LIKE THERE WASN'T AS
MUCH NEWS IN PAST YEARS.

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,180
SOMETIMES YOU HAD TO REMIND
YOURSELF OF WHAT HAS COME

210
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,780
BEFORE, BECAUSE SO QUICKLY,
LIKE, JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

211
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,990
TAKE DOWN TRUMP WE FORGET IT
HAPPENED.

212
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,819
SOME THINGS FEEL SO

213
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:29,670
SIGNIFICANT AND WE JUST HAVE
SORT OF PASSED BY THEM.

214
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,670
THIS

215
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,819
CAME UP AGAIN, BUT ON THE
QUESTION OF POSSIBLE COLLUSION,

216
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:34,819
DONALD TRUMP, JR.

217
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:35,990
RESPONDED TO
AN EMAIL ABOUT THE RUSSIANS'

218
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,250
ATTEMPTS TO GET HIS FATHER
ELECTED AND HE SAID I LOVE IT,

219
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,579
ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE SUMMER.

220
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,339
FINE, FORGET THE COLLUSION THING

221
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:46,550
-- ON THE OBSTRUCTION THING, I
FOUND EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION OF

222
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,519
JUSTICE, I DID SOME RESEARCH, I
FOUND A VIDEO, AND THIS LOW

223
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,150
LEVEL TRUMP EMPLOYEE CALLED
DONALD TRUMP TOLD LESTER HOLT I

224
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,759
WAS THINKING ABOUT THE RUSSIA
THING SO I FIRED THE FBI

225
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,759
DIRECTOR.

226
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,100
THAT IS OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.

227
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
HE SAID HE IS

228
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,600
INVESTIGATING RUSSIA, I DON'T
LIKE IT, SO I FIRED HIM.

229
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
HE'S

230
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,949
INVESTIGATING MY ALLIES, I DON'T
LIKE IT, SO FIRED HIM.

231
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:09,949
HE SAID

232
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,269
HE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE.

233
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,370
>>HE SAID HE IS INVESTIGATING
MY DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA.

234
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,570
>>WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

235
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,089
>>MUELLER IS CAREFUL, HE IS
TRYING TO BUTTON UP THIS

236
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:24,519
INVESTIGATION.

237
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,899
I MENTIONED
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, I KNOW

238
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,269
THERE ARE 12 THINGS, LET ME LIST
YOU A QUICK COUPLE OF THINGS IF

239
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,250
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THEM.

240
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,930
NO
AMERICAN BANK WOULD LEND TRUMP

241
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,570
MONEY ANYMORE, HE HAD GONE BACK
UP SIX TIMES, SO HE BORROWED

242
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,610
MONEY FROM DEUTSCHE BANK, THEY
HAD HIS MONEY IN THE SAME

243
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,279
PORTION THAT WAS INFORMALLY
CALLED THE GLOBAL LAUNDROMAT, IN

244
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,501
THE SAME SECTION WITH RUSSIAN
OLIGARCHS.

245
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,501
THE RUSSIAN ALL THE

246
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:55,430
DARKS BUT A HUGE SECTION OF
TRUMP TOWER TO KEEP HIM AFLOAT,

247
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,029
THEN HE DOES A COUPLE REAL
ESTATE DEALS WHERE HE FLIPS

248
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,730
PROPERTIES FOR HUGE SUMS, ALL
INVOLVING THE RUSSIANS, WHICH

249
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,319
SOUNDS LIKE MONEY LAUNDERING.

250
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:05,310
BY
THE WAY, MUELLER BROUGHT A MONEY

251
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,190
LAUNDERING EXPERT ONTO HIS TEAM.

252
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,760
THEN THERE IS HIS SERVER IN

253
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,399
PENNSYLVANIA, TRUMP HAS A RANDOM
SERVER IN PENNSYLVANIA, INTERNET

254
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:25,829
EXPERTS SAY THIS IS WEIRD, HE
KEEPS GETTING PINGED -- AND IT

255
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,550
TURNS OUT 80% OF THE PINGS ON
TRUMP'S SERVER ARE COMING FROM

256
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:36,009
ALPHA BANK IN RUSSIA.

257
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:39,240
BY THE
WAY, 18% OF THE REST OF THE

258
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,440
PINGS WERE COMING FROM THE
DEVOS FAMILY, WHICH WOUND UP

259
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,199
GETTING A CABINET POSITION.

260
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:49,170
AND
BETSY DEVOS'S BROTHER GOES AND

261
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,250
HAS A MEETING WITH THE RUSSIANS
AFTER THE ELECTION.

262
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,250
THERE ARE NO

263
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,649
COINCIDENCES THAT LARGE.

264
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,220
I DON'T
KNOW IF MUELLER WILL REVEAL THAT

265
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,100
LARGER PART OF THE FINANCIAL
DEAL HE HAS WITH RUSSIA, BUT I

266
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,310
THINK THAT IS WHY TRUMP IS SO
PANICKED.

267
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,310
YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE

268
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,829
PANICKED ABOUT THE OTHER
CHARGES?

269
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,449
YOU COLLUDED WITH THE

270
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:16,560
RUSSIANS TO GET HILLARY' IS
EMAILS.

271
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,920
BIG DEAL.

272
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,209
DON'T LOOK AT

273
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:25,020
THE BANK ACCOUNTS, I WON'T GIVE
YOU MY TAX RETURNS!

274
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,079
HE DID IT,

275
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,089
WHETHER MUELLER FINDS OUT IS THE
BIG MYSTERY, AND THAT WOULD BE

276
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:31,089
SPECTACULAR.

277
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,540
BECAUSE IF HE DID
THE CRIME THAT LARGE AND

278
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,720
PROMISED THE RUSSIANS THAT HE
WOULD LIFT THE SANCTIONS, CHANGE

279
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,279
U.S. POLICY, OR NOT ENFORCE THE
SANCTIONS, CHANGE U.S. POLICY

280
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,580
BECAUSE OF HIS OWN FINANCIAL
DEAL WITH THE RUSSIANS?

281
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,040
OH, LOCK

282
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,510
HIM UP, LOCK HIM UP.

283
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,660
THAT WOULD
BE ONE OF THE GREATEST SCANDALS

284
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,829
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

285
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:54,939
AND IF
THERE'S ANY JUSTICE AT ALL HE

286
00:13:54,939 --> 00:00:00,000
WOULD LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE IN
HANDCUFFS.
