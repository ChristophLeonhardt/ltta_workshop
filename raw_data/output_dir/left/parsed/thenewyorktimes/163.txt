Right now in Syria, there are
roughly 2,000 American troops.
And one day,
recently, a statement
went out calling for direct
attacks against them.
It said that it
was the beginning of:
The statement came from an
influential Syrian militia
called the Baqir Brigade,
which has around
3,000 members.
And aside from threats
by Islamic State,
it was one of the few
times a group in Syria
directly threatened
American troops there.
So why did they make the
threat in the first place?
Who is the Baqir Brigade?
Well, one clue to begin
with, is this photo.
On the right, the head
of the Baqir Brigade.
On the left is
Qassim Suleimani,
who runs all of Iran’s
foreign military activities.
A few years ago, Syria’s
president, Bashar al-Assad,
needed help fighting
a two-front war.
So, Iran came to his aid.
One tactic it used was
funding and training
pro-Assad militias, militias
like the Baqir Brigade.
The militia plays up its
Syrian nationalism
to help downplay the
fact that it’s actually
guided by a foreign power.
Here’s one of the
group’s banners
that sums up its motives.
This, of course, is Syria’s
president — the nationalism
side of things.
But these two men
are not Syrian.
He’s the head of Hezbollah,
a Lebanese group backed
by Iran.
And he’s the
Supreme Leader of Iran.
Iran’s real goal here
is to use militias
to help weave influence
into all aspects
of Syrian society.
Here’s one way it does this:
This is Omar al-Hassan,
the Baqir Brigade’s
political leader.
In this photo he’s in Syria.
Now here’s another photo,
except this time it’s
near the capital of Iran.
He’s visiting the shrine to
Iran’s late supreme leader.
Several militias
send members to Iran
to strengthen bonds
with officials.
They also send groups like
these on educational trips
around the country.
This is all for ideology,
but it’s also for show.
It puts Iran’s influence
front and center.
O.K., back to the politician,
Omar al-Hassan.
Here he is again, this
time back in Syria on a
meet and greet with locals.
We were able to identify
exactly where the photo
was taken.
This was last year.
The Baqir Brigade had
just seized this area
from Islamic State.
But even if they’d wanted
to seize more ground,
they couldn’t.
The Americans and their
allies were in the way.
Not far from where we located
al-Hassan’s photo is a hill.
Recently an image
of that hill
was posted on a social
media account
linked to the Baqir Brigade.
The post was a threat against
American and French troops.
It said:
We’ve geo-located
that hill to right
on the border between
pro-Assad territory
and territory where the
U.S. and its allies operate.
So it was as if to say,
‘Look how close we are.
We’re watching you.’
See, while Iran was
spreading its influence,
the U.S. was spreading
its own influence, too.
The Iranians will say, ‘We
were invited into Syria.
The Americans were not.’
And now that Iran
is nearly done
helping the regime
with its fights,
there’s more time to focus
on getting the Americans out.
There’s already been
a couple of times
when the
Baqir Brigade has come
into contact with Americans.
One was here, last May,
when several Iranian-backed
militias advanced towards
an American-run base.
That prompted U.S. airstrikes.
“It was necessitated
by offensive movement —
I don’t know there were
Iranians on the ground —
but by
Iranian-directed forces.”
Then, nine months
later, American troops
and their allies fought off an
attack by pro-regime forces.
We know that the
Baqir Brigade was there, too.
Now overall, the
U.S. says it plans
to check Iran’s
influence in the region.
“We will track down
Iranian operatives
and their Hezbollah proxies
operating around the world,
and we will crush them.”
The thing is, these
militias aren’t
just on the front lines.
They’re recruiting deep
in territory controlled
by the U.S. and its allies.
And they’ve got humanitarian
operations going on, too.
So that call for jihad?
The brigade was likely
sending a message from Iran
that the U.S. needs
to leave Syria.
And that messaging
hasn’t let up.
In early June, there
was a huge gathering
with the Baqir Brigade
and several other groups.
The leader we saw earlier
with the Iranian general?
He was here.
So was the
politician al-Hassan.
And it took place
not far from the hill
we located earlier, right on
the border of their enemies.
And the title of
the gathering:
on Syrian soil.
