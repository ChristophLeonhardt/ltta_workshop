a facebook investigation into alleged Russian and meddling into the brexit vote in the UK has found no credible evidence but that's not stopped the social network relaunching it search isa ali has the story the social media giant Facebook have contacted British parliamentarians to tell them that they're widening the scope of their investigation into alleged Russian interference in the run-up to the brexit referendum here in the UK Simon Millman he's the policy director for Facebook in the UK writing to Damien Collins MP saying that previous investigations have found that there was very little if any interference in UK politics this work requires detailed analysis of historic data we estimate it will take a number of weeks to complete but the timescale is very much dependent on any findings during the course of the investigation now little over a month ago Facebook concluded that Russians or Russian backed groups spent less than one pound on advertising in the run-up to the brexit referendum they consisted of three adverts which showed over four days and only had around 200 people viewing them so not a very far reach there as the current atmosphere is one of trying to find evidence of Russian interference wherever it can be found a show mounted a sustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption it is seeking to weaponize information and it seems the rhetoric around so-called Russian interference continues that's despite the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson admitting that there wasn't a sausage of evidence to suggest Russia was meddling in internal UK affairs but nevertheless the witch hunt continues
