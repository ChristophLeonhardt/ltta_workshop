some people here are calling it an exodus more than a thousand migrants fleeing Honduras on foot arrived at a migrant shelter in Guatemala City on Wednesday a group of migrants set off from Honduras last week and the caravan has since grown rapidly people hoped that traveling as a group will help protect them from robberies assaults and kidnappings enroute to Mexico in the United States a voyage many say they've been forced to make we don't want to go and invade their country but hunger and the needs of our children oblige us to do this we don't want to abandon our nation I didn't want to come here but we're being killed little by little I hope people can understand staff at the privately run shelter say they've already provided food shelter and medical assistance to around 2,000 migrants and they expect thousands more to arrive at the shelter in the coming days neither tropical heat and seasonal downpours nor threats of detention from security forces have deterred the migrants it was a really hard decision to come I have two small children one and two years old but we're doing this to avoid more suffering president Donald Trump has threatened to cut off hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador if the migrant caravan isn't stopped and turned around but for the people who were escaping a region beset by gang violence poverty and corruption such threats have little meaning as accion it's a troubling action because the poor have never benefited from this aid not from the Alliance for Prosperity nor from free trade agreements basically those who are rich benefit while the poor are excluded and so they continue to migrate more hunter and migrants are arriving here by the minute most say that they're going to stay in these shelters for the night to rest up before heading towards the Mexican border that's a journey that's more than 250 kilometers long and with a lot of rain in the forecast it's going to be a difficult journey with little to lose these migrants say they're determined to push north regardless of what stands in away but with the Trump administration intent on stopping the caravan before it reaches the US border their dreams of a better life could be cut short David Mercer al Jazeera in Guatemala City
