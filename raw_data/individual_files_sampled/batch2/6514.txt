so Sasha Baron Cohen is added again we have seen him succeed wildly with conservatives although it's time some Republicans say no I'm not gonna do that when he asked for preposterous things and we have seen him fail with Bernie Sanders when he tried to Punk him so now we have Georgia State Representative Jason Spencer will he succeed the answer is wildly amazingly you're going to love this so the show is called who's America it's on Showtime and and I'm gonna just show you clips here cuz we can't show you the nudity dispenser agreed to do awesome phenomenal but who the hell is Spencer why we even having a conversation about him well he made a little bit of news because he pushed for two things in Georgia one was a burka ban which he explained to captain Aaron Mourad one of the characters that Sacha Baron Cohen does he renamed so that it wouldn't be illegal otherwise he knew his own law was going to be illegal the burka ban is gonna come into play here in in just a minute when I show you the videos and the same thing he's gonna for is threatening a fellow legislator in Georgia who happened to be african-american saying that she better not go to certain parts of Georgia if she cares about her safety so that's this charming gentleman so having him mocked is particularly fantastic and you can see how profoundly stupid he is in his reactions so in talking about the burka ban Sacha Baron Cohen's character here tells him that he is sympathetic and that he used this trick as part of what he does in Israel of using selfie sticks to take pictures under people's burkas he explains further here I do not know whether this is a woman or a man with a explosive we pretend to be a Chinese tourist because the Chinese always taking selfie okay convince him oh hell that you are Chinese god my senior konichiwa honey red dragon obereg' on a Hong Kong it seems I meant in your Hong Kong your sushi well that's it oh I see there is a red jacket curse you oh you speak attorney Ho Chi Minh City wanna know something of that thank you thank you we're draggin chopstick no no sushi sushi Oh No Antonina good let's look at the picture he's not a terrorist okay I mean does it get any better than that by the way it's going to later in this segment I thought you couldn't top that red dragon chopsticks Ho Chi Minh City Hong Kong but my favorites were konnichiwa which is not Chinese and sushi also not Chinese okay Wow okay oh boy now we're gonna do the second clip where he gets the representative to yell the n-word over and over again now if you ask a rational person to do this they would not apparently representative Jason Spencer was happy to as you'll see in this clip now we're gonna play it in in its entirety cuz I want you to understand the power of the words and a you it'll get lost if all we do is bleep them so here you go because of who you are you could be the victim of kidnapping by Isis you have two second to attract attention how do you attract attention very start screaming take your clothes off in America there is one forbidden world it is the N world now I am going to be the terrorist you have three seconds to attack the tension go you crazy the N world is loony not this world this world is disgusting Wow Wow I laugh at the N word is nuni by the way throughout he says I am been in Mossad for 13 years not in Mossad he keeps saying in Mossad not in Musa very clearly he gets he Punk's him here and then tells him he Punk's him but still he manages to get more absurdity now we're going way over the top buckle up brace for impact I see so scared of being seen as Omo you know it did me know if your buttock touch them it means they have become a transsexual now I am going to teach you how to use your buttocks to intimidate Isis show me the buttock no trousers down okay go America good one more time but louder with America do anything if someone told you to yell America ask first that you would take your trousers down when you're a state representative or anyone any rational human being and do that it got worse but I can't show you the rest because he actually got him to take off his underwear there's cameras everywhere I mean his ass is all over I don't know they didn't show the front thank God you know I did a super sieve is easy he said in Mossad I'm not in the Sun we have a saying if you want to win you show some skin so the guy takes office under where it starts attacking with his bare ass that's who representative Jason Spencer is and that's why this show is great because it exposes people for who they actually are and that's the genius of Sasha Baron Cohen two easy ways to follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of our videos
