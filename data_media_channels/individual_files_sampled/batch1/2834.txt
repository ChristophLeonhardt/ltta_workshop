but I just felt that that moment was it was a disrespectful moment to Milan because I was an incredible production made by a bunch of incredible people and I think on the Academy's part and the people who were directly involved in the moment that was disrespectful but I know they'll be just stuck with us just to allow that to take away from the moment that we're at right it was a strange moment it was very awkward I think it was awkward for lala land and that's a shame for them I think our producers didn't have an opportunity to say everything that they wanted to say you know it was a very strange moment it's a shame that it happened but I don't know I don't you know these things happen and we just have to take the positives the positive is we won we spent a lot of time with those guys and so I felt it was a ridiculous mix of emotions I thought they were very gracious and what happened and because I spent so much time with Jordan I knew he meant what he was saying and so they were shocked but also too you know I wanted to give him a hug I think I'm pretty sure it's the first thing I did when I went up on stage but things happen you know you make a film the boom comes into the shot nobody does it on purpose it just happens we're human beings you know what we're not perfect you so there's an imperfect way to get for us the perfect result no no they were super super gracious about it and we love them and it's been a long time that we've been on this tour with them and we've got to know them very well and I think there's a lot of mutual respect and I think that any any one of the teams that might have been up there tonight in the same situation would have handle it handles it as gracefully as they had and and we certainly I hope would have if it was a reverse situation
