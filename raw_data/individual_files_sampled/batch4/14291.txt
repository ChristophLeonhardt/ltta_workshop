is it even possible in 2018 to stop the hacking or stealing of intellectual property or do you can't stop it you just have to punish it how do you deal with that well the only way to stop it is to punish it to impose costs which are at least as great or greater than the benefits that China is obtaining you know we've had a succession of American presidents who have talked about this so for instance you know President Obama September 2015 si Jinping went to the Rose Garden outside the Oval Office and the two of them Trump s re Obama and Xi Jinping promised that they would not cyber attack the commercial enterprises of the other country for commercial purposes right you know we spy on them they spy on us that's sort of considered to be normal but what the Chinese do which we don't do is we don't then you know try to hack Huawei to get commercial secrets that we then give to Cisco or IBM that doesn't occur in the United States so you know si Jinping agreed to it but they've continued to do it yeah and so you just can't have an agreement with China you've got to make them hurt it's unfortunate yeah the markets won't like it but we have no choice because each year the u.s. loses somewhere between 225 billion to 600 billion dollars worth of intellectual property most of that to China that number comes from the IP Commission the Blair Huntsman report and they did an update of their 2013 report in 2017 and they upped the estimates of loss of US IP so you can't do that bleeding you know the US economy right now we don't manufacture as much as we used to it's an innovation economy well if you steal the products of innovation there's no economy left yeah and that's what you know we're seeing with these section 301 tariffs that eventually be put in place and all of these curbs on China's investment into the tech sector it's unfortunate you know you you would prefer not to do it but the Chinese have left us no choice yeah that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
