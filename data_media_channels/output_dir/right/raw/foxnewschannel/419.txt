1
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:13,566
>> HE HAS BEEN RACE

2
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:13,933
IGLESIAS.

3
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,601
HE HAS BEEN SEXIST.

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:20,306
HE HAS BEEN ISLAMOPHOBIC.

5
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:20,706
ANTI-LBGTQ.

6
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:21,474
THERE IS A LONG LIST.

7
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:22,808
HE TALKS TO THAT AMERICA.

8
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,410
HE TALKS TO THEM ALL THE

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:24,710
TIME.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,581
THEY T. IS A VERY HARD CORE

11
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:29,548
WHO ARE RESPONDING TO HIM

12
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:32,685
AND SUPPORTING HIM.

13
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:33,786
BRIAN: THAT HARD CORE MADE

14
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:34,253
HIM PRESIDENT.

15
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:34,887
HILLARY CLINTON IS BACK

16
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:35,921
GOING AFTER THE PRESIDENT

17
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:37,456
AND HIS SUPPORTERS AGAIN.

18
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:39,692
OUR NEXT GUEST CALLS THIS

19
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:40,559
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,827
LEFT'S DANGEROUS AND

21
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:42,561
IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC.

22
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:43,896
OR IS, IT JUST HILLARY

23
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:44,230
CLINTON?

24
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,432
HERE TO EXPLAIN IS FORMER

25
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:47,099
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY

26
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:48,167
SEAN SPICER.

27
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:48,768
SEAN, HILLARY CLINTON'S

28
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:50,670
NUMBERS HAVE NEVER BEEN SO

29
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,737
LOW AMONG DEMOCRATS IN TERMS

30
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:52,972
OF POPULARITY IS THAT THE

31
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:54,940
REASON TO BELIEVE OR IS SHE

32
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,008
JUST ECHOING EVERYBODY

33
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:58,544
ELSE'S MESSAGE?

34
00:00:58,544 --> 00:00:59,979
>> I THINK THAT'S PART OF

35
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:00,379
THE REASON.

36
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,214
PART OF THE REASON SHE LOST

37
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:02,415
THE CAMPAIGN SHE DOESN'T

38
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:03,849
RECOGNIZE THE 60-PLUS

39
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:04,950
MILLION PEOPLE THAT VOTED

40
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,219
FOR DONALD TRUMP FOR

41
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:06,953
PRESIDENT BECAUSE MOST OF

42
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:08,521
THOSE PEOPLE WANTED A VOICE

43
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,088
IN WASHINGTON.

44
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:10,256
THEY FELT LIKE THE SYSTEM

45
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,058
WAS LEAVING BEHIND THEIR

46
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:13,192
HARD WORKING AMERICANS THAT

47
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:14,494
JUST WANT TO PLAY BY THE

48
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:14,794
RULES.

49
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:15,862
WORK A HARD DAY.

50
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:16,629
AND HAVE THEIR GOVERNMENT

51
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:17,730
RESPECT THEM.

52
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,464
AND I THINK HILLARY CLINTON

53
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:19,966
STILL DOESN'T GET THEM.

54
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,367
AND EQUALLY, I MEAN, YOU

55
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:22,268
LOOK, THERE WERE TWO SIDES

56
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:23,102
ON THAT STAGE.

57
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:23,803
NOT JUST HILLARY CLINTON.

58
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:25,271
BUT THIS GUY FROM THE

59
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:26,339
ATLANTIC JEFFREY GOLDBERG

60
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:28,174
WHO DIDN'T ASK A FOLLOW-UP

61
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:28,975
QUESTION.

62
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:29,375
LET SO.

63
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,576
GO BY THE WAYSIDE.

64
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:31,644
HE IS PARSTD THE PROBLEM.

65
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:33,746
NOT JUST HILLARY CLINTON BUT

66
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:35,214
A LOT ON THE LEFT IN THE

67
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:36,182
MEDIA DON'T GET HOW MANY

68
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:37,350
FOLKS IN AMERICA SHARE THE

69
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,184
CONCERNS AND THE JEANGTED

70
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:40,186
AND THE POLICY THAT DONALD

71
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:42,221
TRUMP IS FORWARDING.

72
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:45,291
>> ANOTHER MAJOR STORY.

73
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:47,226
THAT

74
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:47,260
REAT

75
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,928
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARD

76
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:48,961
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARA

77
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:48,995
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARY

78
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:43,389
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARN

79
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:49,028
THE PRESIDENT REDID NAFLT

80
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:49,329
RENAFTA IN AWAY I HAVE NOT HEARE

81
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,129
BE CRITICAL OF.

82
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,297
THIS BETTER DEAL THAT

83
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:53,232
ACTUALLY HAS TECH AND IP IN

84
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:55,168
IT WHICH WASN'T THERE IN THE

85
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:56,536
1980S, OBVIOUSLY, HAS GOTTEN

86
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:57,403
PRAISE FROM CHUCK SCHUMER.

87
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,038
YOU THINK THAT'S BEEN

88
00:01:59,038 --> 00:01:59,772
BURIED, WHY?

89
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:00,573
>> WELL, BECAUSE IT'S A WIN

90
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:01,608
FOR THE PRESIDENT.

91
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:03,176
BUT, LOOK, THIS PRESIDENT

92
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:04,410
AND A LOT OF PRESIDENTS HAVE

93
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,612
TALKED ABOUT RENEGOTIATING

94
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:06,546
NAFTA AS YOU RECALL

95
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:07,614
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE WAS

96
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:09,049
GOING TO DO THAT AS A

97
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:09,416
CANDIDATE.

98
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:09,949
NOTHING HAPPENED.

99
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,984
THIS PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS

100
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:11,651
GOING TO DO IT.

101
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:12,986
AND HE DID IT.

102
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:14,287
AND IT BENEFITS OUR WORKERS,

103
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:16,022
OUR FARMERS, OUR RANCHERS,

104
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:16,957
OUR MANUFACTURERS.

105
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:17,891
AS YOU POINTED OUT.

106
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:20,293
I MEAN, NAFTA IS TWO AND A

107
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:21,861
HALF DECADES OLD.

108
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,496
THE IDEA THAT THE

109
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:24,731
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

110
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:25,966
PRENDSES, THE DIGITAL

111
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:27,267
PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE ALL

112
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:27,801
UPDATED.

113
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,903
THE LABOR STANDARDS, THE

114
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:30,537
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS,

115
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:31,237
THINGS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE

116
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:32,172
TALKED ABOUT FOR YEARS.

117
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:33,673
THE STUFF FOR THE AUTO

118
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:34,007
WORKERS.

119
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,942
THIS TREMENDOUS FOR OUR AUTO

120
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:36,309
WORKERS.

121
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:37,410
DAIRY FARMERS IN WISCONSIN.

122
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,113
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID WAS

123
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:40,614
REMARKABLE.

124
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:42,349
BRIAN: IT IS, GUESS WHO ELSE

125
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:43,116
IT HELPS?

126
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:43,750
UNION MEMBERS.

127
00:02:43,750 --> 00:00:00,000
EVEN MEXICO MIGHT RAISE
