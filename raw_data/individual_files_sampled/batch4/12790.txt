so Bill Maher had on Piers Morgan and I'm now going to be forced to defend Piers Morgan and I hate this so much as a person who is instrumental in ending Piers Morgan CNN career let me just say the Piers Morgan's wrong about virtually everything but here he's actually right and this again shows you that the left has no capacity to have a real argument Piers Morgan says something correct and immediately other people on Bill Maher show immediately begins saying f you to Piers Morgan they wouldn't be dealing with everybody in the world we wouldn't be doing this Russia are you crazy there is no Muslim ban if there was you say he hasn't done this he hasn't done that he's not gonna do all this these give him a chance mate he'll kill the Jews on the first day he worked up to it nonsense you just like that you won The Apprentice and you have a famous friend so two things one he's right the Piers Morgan only likes Trump cuz you wanted him on the apprentice that's actually true but wait but what he's saying there about how Hitler didn't kill all the Jews on the first day this routine okay again Donald Trump's Muslim ban is not a Muslim ban even if it were a Muslim ban that would not be the same as genocide in six million Jews let's let's stop pretending the donald trump is some sort of genocide or maniac because you have no evidence of any of that and yet the left cheers this because the more hysterical you are on the left the more people are going to take you seriously it seems like the same thing on the right to a certain extent the more hysterical you are the more people take you seriously if both sides begin to engage in the sort of politics then politics is over politics is just done there's no room for a rational truth based politics
