1
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,429
chef what were<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

2
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,440
performing sectors and stocks in your

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,350
portfolio in 2009 we did really really

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,900
well a smart grid and are not converge

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,660
those were two real big winners for us I

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,150
think 2009 was a good year for smart

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,349
grid overall because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it finally got a</font>

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,449
lot of an investor attention that it

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,989
wasn't getting in 2008 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again I mean</font>

10
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at policy support the government</font>

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,980
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very very supportive of energy</font>

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">efficiency and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conservation that their</font>

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,280
measures because it has ever say it's

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
the low-hanging fruit you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,239
really is and again it also looking at a

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,480
lot of technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're not</font>

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,860
really invented reinventing the wheel

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,949
you know it's not rocket science they

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,390
just it's a matter of integrating this

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,850
stuff and companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> like converge and in</font>

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,829
or not get a lot of big contracts last

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,359
year and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the utilities are</font>

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,190
signing on so I think 20 tends to be a

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good year for smarter as well so</font>

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,549
you mentioned a few sucks what were some

26
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,140
of your favorite stocks last year in

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,000
their performance is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite stocks</font>

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
last year a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese solar</font>

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,810
stocks just<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> killed it and again</font>

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean it's I suspect we're going to see</font>

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,210
the same thing in 2010 maybe not to the

32
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,479
same agree but yeah the still

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,920
outperforming the market but maybe not

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,659
to the extent that they did in 2009

35
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,490
right i think well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened</font>

36
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,619
in 2009 was with all the policies port

37
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,220
in china a lot of the big money kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,900
finally signed on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> China</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because a</font>

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,180
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago China you know and for</font>

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,250
obvious reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> there people are very</font>

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,900
skeptical China you know say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh what</font>

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,799
we're going to do this we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that</font>

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,299
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you've said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of things</font>

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">before so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there were a lot of</font>

45
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,960
investors are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very skeptical I certainly</font>

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,840
was and you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago we</font>

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,490
wouldn't touch the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese solar stocks</font>

48
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,799
but it just kind of got to that point it

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,420
just it was make or break and you knew

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,189
like the policy was always there

51
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,110
supporting it and these companies were

52
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,479
they were they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling more solar</font>

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,840
panels and more solar cells than the

54
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,860
European companies in the US companies

55
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,659
and at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day it's like if I</font>

56
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,090
look at the sales I know

57
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,519
happening if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how much you know</font>

58
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,769
the future contracts it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

59
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,739
just you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a meet-up Iranians</font>

60
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,840
yeah so that's what we did one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,340
really focused on in China<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the</font>

62
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,900
companies that do have really close

63
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,700
connections with the government I know

64
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,780
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you're tied in with the</font>

65
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">government you're set so companies like</font>

66
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">yingli was really good solar fun was</font>

67
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,970
another one suntech power<font color="#E5E5E5"> j solar which</font>

68
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,190
actually make solar cells they make them

69
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,660
cheaper than anybody and faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

70
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">anybody and that's that's when this</font>

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a sleeper for</font>

72
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,849
a while really<font color="#E5E5E5"> came to life towards the</font>

73
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:44,329
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2009 but i don't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

74
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,579
competition for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> company in 2010 so</font>

75
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,769
2010 in the next decade what are some of

76
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sectors that you're more bullish on</font>

77
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,370
which may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some of the companies that</font>

78
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">would benefit i wish they were pretty we</font>

79
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,260
really changed much the only i would say

80
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the chinese solar</font>

81
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,620
companies are still real strong on the

82
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,420
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturing so our</font>

83
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,890
manufacturers that are coming to us to

84
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,299
set up shop<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the u.s. because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

85
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get stimulus dollars and that's</font>

86
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to push</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stock up even if it's</font>

87
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,590
only for a short<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of time so will</font>

88
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,000
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably trade some those</font>

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
stocks to we know like who's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,090
what companies going<font color="#E5E5E5"> where when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

91
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,880
make their<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions because we know</font>

92
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,139
that once the contracts are signed they

93
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,850
start making start building those

94
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,799
facilities the money's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

95
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,370
showing up as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as wind down we're</font>

96
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,079
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> real bullish on when the turbine</font>

97
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,920
manufacturers are really the main way to

98
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,099
go I'm actually pretty big on developers

99
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:38,389
at this point the companies are actually

100
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,190
developing the wind<font color="#E5E5E5"> farms you don't have</font>

101
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,540
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pure play that pure players</font>

102
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,910
there you have a lot of funds that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

103
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,810
have 33 holdings of smaller companies

104
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,579
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one Western wind power</font>

105
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,349
corporation is a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

106
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,980
bullish on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a pure wind developer</font>

107
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're set up in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> California and you</font>

108
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,849
should probably know as I'm started the

109
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,040
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> California is twenty percent folio</font>

110
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,650
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> nundi to laser have made it so</font>

111
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,180
far so they need every they need every

112
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,269
watt they can get so essentially any any

113
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,370
renewable power in California I mean

114
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,889
it's got a home and it's got a contract

115
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,060
so I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> western win because they have</font>

116
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,640
a small facility now but they have 120

117
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,930
megawatt<font color="#E5E5E5"> fund that they're building this</font>

118
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,168
year they have all the funding they need

119
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,410
the power

120
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,000
the power purchase agreement is done I

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
mean everything's done it's just a

122
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter of building at this point and the</font>

123
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,530
other stools there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> some problems</font>

124
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,700
from some of these companies getting

125
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,650
funding so anytime I see a company that

126
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,840
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have funding in place I'm very</font>

127
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,240
attentive so you talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of</font>

128
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,010
the direct ways that investors can go is

129
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,530
are there in direct plays like say a

130
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,690
Goldman Sachs or Honda or continental

131
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,370
some of the companies that seemingly are

132
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,190
greener than others well there's a

133
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple ways to look at I mean there's</font>

134
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,920
some people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to invest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

135
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,840
companies that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have a green or</font>

136
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,030
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just kind of like well okay</font>

137
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,850
they may have some holdings in Monsanto

138
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,400
which obviously is not a green company

139
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,900
but they're very bullish on a lot of

140
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,420
solar<font color="#CCCCCC"> or wind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies I think that's a</font>

141
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,650
slippery slope because that really

142
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,930
that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a philosophical investing</font>

143
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,660
technique and I mean I'll be honest with

144
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you everyone has their own idea of what</font>

145
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,260
green is but you know you invest make

146
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,050
money so you know I've never really

147
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,130
understood<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of investing in</font>

148
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,200
something if at the end of the day there

149
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,260
wasn't going to be some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of payoff</font>

150
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,030
so but then there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other indirect</font>

151
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,530
plays that one I can think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> off tomm</font>

152
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,110
ahead is American superconductor is a

153
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,050
company that provides certain mechanisms

154
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,230
for wind turbines that are built by a

155
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,670
company called saina bell which is a

156
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">chinese turbine manufacturer well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

157
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,750
that company's been getting millions and

158
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,610
millions of dollars of contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2009</font>

159
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,110
from sign of<font color="#E5E5E5"> El so I was going to be the</font>

160
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,760
biggest wind turbine manufacturer in the

161
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,320
world in a couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the</font>

162

<font color="#E5E5E5">mean they're going to just again it</font>

165
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,010
always look that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing they</font>

166
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,730
do it cheaper faster and and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> suspect</font>

167
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,050
that American super character probably

169
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,310
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> El that course is like you can play</font>

170
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,720
certain utilities that maybe are heavy

171
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,840
on on renewables there's some companies

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,880
like ITC holdings which is a company

173
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,490
that builds transmission they're trying

174
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to build a transmission line in the</font>

175
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,650
Middle West<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to live a lot of</font>

176
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,419
wind power it's clocking is called a

177
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,550
green power line it's a pretty big

178
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,530
undertaking but if it goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

179
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,030
going to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very profitable so</font>

180
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,940
Buffett's ten percent stake<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> byd was</font>

181
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,070
that really an electric car player what

182
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,230
was he doing there yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font>

183

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get on the yeah</font>

184
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:30,709
I mean electric cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gonna launch of</font>

185
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,539
sedan I think in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

186
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,069
couple your 2011 i think is when it

187
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,619
arrives here you know it for the battery

188
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:39,649
power was it actually for the technology

189
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,329
that's a tough call i don't know the

190
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,559
technology isn't any different than

191
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything else i mean again did they</font>

going to be a very big car manufacturing

201
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:12,379
hub and electric cars really<font color="#CCCCCC"> are plug-in</font>

202
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:13,669
hybrids and electric cars really are the

203
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:15,979
future of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal transportation we</font>

204
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,839

226
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:58,579
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years but I think that we're</font>

227
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,799
we're regular hybrids are today is where

228
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,839
plug-in hybrids will be in electric

229
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,549
vehicles will be in 10 years great

230
00:08:04,549 --> 00:00:00,000
