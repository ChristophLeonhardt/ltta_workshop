1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:01,920
“My name is George
Tillman Jr.,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,340
and I am the director
of “The Hate U Give.”

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,349
We always called this
scene “the talk.”

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:09,390
The scene was actually in
the middle of the book,

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,030
but we decided very
early on to move it

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,560
at the top of the film.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,000
What I love about
this scene is,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,504
outside, you see a
normal neighborhood,

9
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:18,420
with a lot of playing.

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,200
It feels like a
Saturday afternoon.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,850
But I cinematically
wanted to move slowly

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,280
towards this house,
to really show

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,250
that, while everyone is
having a good time playing,

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,250
there’s important business
being done with the Carter

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,310
family.

16
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,430
The first guy we
see is Mav Carter.

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,520
You see a guy who got
braids, and he got a tattoo,

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,695
so your assumption is that
this guy is a gang member

19
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:42,210
and he’s up to no good.

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,860
But as the scene
sort of progressed,

21
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,170
I love turning the
scene on its head

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,505
and seeing that he’s not
who you think he is.”

23
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:50,421
“Now, one day, you’re
all going to be with me,

24
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:52,320
and you best bet we
gonna get pulled over.”

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,586
He’s a guy who’s a
father, a husband,

26
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:57,210
and he’s talking
about something that’s

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,720
a very serious issue, that
he’s telling them to put

28
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,725
their hands on the table.

29
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:05,159
“You’re going to see me
with my hands like this.”

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,450
What I love about
this scene is

31
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,390
that this feels like a normal
conversation like somebody

32
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,900
would have about the birds and
the bees with their children.

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,760
But this is a
scene that’s very

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,610
normal in a lot of
African-American families

35
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,616
across the country, which is,
how you keep your kids safe.

36
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:21,990
How do you get
them to understand

37
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,900
how to act around
police officers?

38
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,130
It’s all about a father
protecting his family.

39
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,500
“It can get real dangerous,
so don’t argue with them.

40
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,035
But keep — “

41
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:33,640
The rehearsal for the
scene was very important.

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,750
It started off by rehearsing a
scene with Lamar Johnson, who

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,870
plays Seven, and Amandla
Stenberg, who plays Starr.

44
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,060
They rehearsed the
scene, but they are not

45
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,490
actually in the scene, but I
only rehearsed it with them

46
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,740
so they could have it as a
backstory for them, moving

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,240
forward, for the
rest of the film.

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,423
“Now, just because we got
to deal with this mess,

49
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,006
don’t you ever forget
that being black

50
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,875
is an honor, because you
come from greatness.”

51
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,794
But the young kids who
played the scene in the film,

52
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:00,960
I didn’t rehearse with them.

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,270
I wanted them to be on
camera for the first time

54
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,780
experiencing that.

55
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,910
So what we do —

56
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,310
we’re seeing three
different kinds of dynamics

57
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,960
in this scene,
is understanding

58
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,750
the subtext of what an
African-American family go

59
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,007
through in the inner city.

60
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,340
We’re seeing a
father figure who

61
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,370
is very present
in the household.

62
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,320
And we’re seeing
a relationship

63
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,926
that shows a
loving relationship

64
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:22,050
between a husband and wife.

65
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,549
Even though they
have disagreements,

66
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,500
we still see a love.

67
00:02:26,500 --> 00:00:00,000
“You understand?”
