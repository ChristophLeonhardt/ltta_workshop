HIS SPEECH 20 MINUTES AGO AND
DAVID, BEGIN WITH YOU.
WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATION NOW AS
WE AWAIT A FINAL VOTE?
>> THERE ARE TWO SENATORS YOU
LOOK AT.
ONE IS A DEMOCRAT WHO VOTED YES
ON MOVING THE VOTE AND THAT'S
MR. MANCHIN.
APPARENTLY HE HEARD A LOT FROM
HIS CONSTITUENTS IN WEST
VIRGINIA.
HE IS IN A VERY HEAVY PRO-TRUMP
STATE OVER 40% OF HIS
CONSTITUENTS VOTED FOR DONALD
TRUMP IN THE LAST ELECTION.
SO HE IS REALLY IN THE
SPOTLIGHT.
HE VOTED YES TODAY.
HE COULD VOTE NO TOMORROW ON
THE FINAL VOTE BUT THEN YOU
HAVE MS. MURCOWSKI WHO VOTED NO
TODAY.
IS IT CONCEIVABLE YOU COULD
VOTE NO ON A MOVE FOR THE VOTE
ON THE CLOTURE MOVE AND VOTE
YES TOMORROW?
THAT'S RARELY, IF EVER DONE.
MAYBE ED HENRY WHO KNOW MORE
ABOUT THE HISTORY.
WHAT IS SHE GOING TO HEAR FROM
HER CONSTITUENTS IN ALASKA
BETWEEN NOW AND TOMORROW AT THE
TIME OF THE VOTE?
WILL SHE CHANGE FROM A NO TODAY
TO A YES ON KAVANAUGH TOMORROW?
AN OPEN QUESTION.
>> Sandra: WHAT ABOUT THAT, ED?
>> I CAN'T THINK OF A CASE IN A
HIGH PROFILE SITUATION WHERE
YOU VOTE NO NOW AND THEN YES
SOMEHOW FOR FINAL PASSAGE.
I THINK DAVID IS RIGHT THAT
MURCOWSKI IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO
BE YES FOR KAVANAUGH.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HERE IS THE MATH.
IF MURCOWSKI STAYS NO TOMORROW
AND MANCHIN POTENTIALLY SPLITS
THIS AND SAYS TO ITS
CONSTITUENTS LOOK I VOTED YES
TO MOVE IT FORWARD.
I DON'T LIKE THE DIVISION IN
WASHINGTON
I WANT TO GIVE THE MAN A VOTE.
BUT POTENTIALLY VOTES NO IN
FINAL PASSAGE TO APPEASE
DEMOCRATS.
LET'S ASSUME THAT FOR A MOMENT
AND COLLINS AND FLAKE, WHO BOTH
VOTED AYE TO MOVE IT FORWARD.
IF THEY HOLD ON FINAL PASSAGE
YOU'RE AT 49 TOMORROW EVENING.
YOU ARE NOT AT 50.
