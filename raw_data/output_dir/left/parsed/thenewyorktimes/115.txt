Hello.
Hi.
Yes, I can see.
I like how you look.
Amazing.
I met Inge almost 15
years ago in school.
– One summer, she started
writing these lyrics
about blood and death.
And I told her, “This sounds
like death metal lyrics.”
And she goes, “Death
metal, what is that?”
Inge wrote the lyrics,
and we wrote the music
for these songs.
O.K., let’s do those
two lines again.
– Only two lines.
Save your breath.
Do you know why I want
to keep you doing this?
Because this way,
you keep living.
Your spirit is up.
And then it lifts
your body up.
Yeah, so just those
three measures.
Shouting!
Yes.
Yes!
That’s awesome.
Again?
Now you can go, “Raaawwwr!”
[MUSIC - DEAN MARTIN, ‘TRY
AGAIN’]
"(SINGING) And that’s why
you must try, try again."
You just ruined that
sheep’s whole day.
Poor sheep.
Poor sheep, yeah.
Exactly.
You can keep going.
If she got the beginning,
we can just do the —
We’re close.
We’re very close.
We need love.
Just do — we need love.
Does that work?
Yes.
We’re going to just
do a different thing
with the camera.
Can you look at
yourself in the small mirror?
We’re both nervous
because we’re performing
in “America’s Got Talent.”
Well, I’m not nervous
at all because of that.
I’m nervous because of Inge.
Yeah.
She says, she doesn’t
want to go now.
Just go and talk to her.
Take a deep breath, Inge.
We’re all here now.
You know what you
need? Pampering.
You need pampering.
You —
You’re going to be so bored
after two hours of quiet.
And I love the preparation
more than anything.
Isn’t this the best time?
Yeah, O.K. That’s it.
O.K. Good.
You want me to
turn the light off?
Are we ready to go?
Let’s go.
— Let’s go, that’s it!
You see? That’s all
you need to do.
Just go.
We keep doing this
with Inge because we
know this gives her energy.
We know that this
keeps her alive.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh.
Wow.
So Inge, I want you to
really go crazy there.
I want you full of energy.
So the beginning,
fairy tale-like.
Da, da, da, and
then duh, duh, duh!
[MUSIC - ‘IF I WERE A RICH
MAN’]
(SINGING) All day long, I’d
biddy-biddy-bum
If I were a wealthy man!
