00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,900
coincidence that the most powerful drug

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,730
trafficking organization in the world

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,360
the most infamous famous notorious drug

lord Joaquin el chapo guzman he's from

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,720
Sinaloa so the link is very clear yes

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,869

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fame you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the other day I</font>

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,989
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it like that you know i'm</font>

15
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,420
wondering if white people see him as

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,379
like as they saw for example pablo

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,550
escobar he was like bad like you know in

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,789

20
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,969
different totally different personality

21
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,100
I don't know he probably did kill a lot

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,580
of people as well but he also did a lot

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,010
of good and the proof is that everyone

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,070
you know is marching because they

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,320
support him for him so we're seeing

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,850
something that has never happened in

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,189
