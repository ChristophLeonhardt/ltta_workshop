one of the more recent health bags have to do with super food first of all there's no definition of a superfood now conveniently people who market the foods like to call them superfood you might have heard superfoods like the acai berry the goji berry quinoa kale and it's not to say oh these foods are not healthy they certainly are but there's nothing about any of them that is particularly outstanding that you can't also get in other foods at the end of the day all people need to know is that any plant-based food is a superfood kale is a wonderful food so is charge so we're collard greens so it's spinach quinoa is really healthy for you so is oatmeal so it's amaranth so it's millet quinoa more healthy for you than those other things no you don't have to spend a hundred more dollars buying exotic things Sonnen have two around the world I would say make sure you're eating fruit and vegetables every single day that's all you really need to do all people need to know is that any plant-based food is a superfood you know people talk about goji berries and goji berries that are flown in from you know Nepal and the Himalayas and this whole idea and they cost 40 bucks a pound but and yeah goji berries are healthy but an apple or a banana is just as healthy
