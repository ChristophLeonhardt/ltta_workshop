00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,160
In February 2016, the US government ordered
the tech company, Apple, to create software

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,410
that could grant unauthorized access into
the iPhone.

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,379
The FBI has said this access would allow them
to investigate a suspect in the San Bernardino

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,410
terror attack.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,720
But Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has refused, saying
that a backdoor to the iPhone could lead to

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,390
significant privacy concerns for its customers.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,730
It is rare for a major company to defy the
federal government, so we wanted to know,

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,390
just how powerful is Apple?

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,300
Well, Apple is the world’s most valuable
publicly traded company.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,630
In February 2015 it rose to be the first US
company worth more than $700 billion dollars,

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:46,330
about the same as the GDP of Saudi Arabia
Since 1976, Apple has manufactured and sold

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,330
personal computers, but they are now better
known for consumer electronics, including

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,460
phones, tablets, mp3 players and smartwatches.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,730
Apple has sold more than 700 million iPhones
worldwide, and stand as the leading smartphone

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,650
retailer in the US.

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,890
But much of Apple’s financial success doesn’t
come from its quantity of sales, but rather

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,900
the amount spent on each device.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,050
In fact, iPhones only count for roughly 14
percent of the global smartphone market.

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,110
Yet, Apple still makes more than half of the
total profits in that industry.

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,990
This, combined with the tight ecosystem of
their products, has given Apple an unusual

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,000
amount of brand loyalty.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,790
In a 2015 survey of iPhone users, more than
83 percent of respondents said they planned

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,590
to stick with Apple for their next smartphone
purchase.

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,910
Apple product releases and store openings
are known to attract thousands of people,

25
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,060
some of whom wait for hours in line.

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,300
With such a widespread level of reach and
influence, any security breach on Apple products

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,230
has severe consequences.

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,920
This was demonstrated in 2014, when hundreds
of private photos of celebrities surfaced

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,680
online as the result of a suspected iCloud
hack.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,440
This was not only devastating to those who
were involved, but it raised concern around

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,590
the security of services like iCloud, which
store mass amounts of private information.

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,370
In fact, later that same year, the company
revamped the level of encryption in their

33
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,258
mobile operating systems, preventing hackers,
governments, and even Apple themselves from

34
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,618
gaining access.

35
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,510
Tim Cook has long described digital privacy
as a human right, and has repeatedly moved

36
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,130
beyond his role as CEO, into the center of
high-stakes social and political issues.

37
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,250
As Apple devices have increasingly been able
to carry more personal data, they have been

38
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,260
forced to become more secure.

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,530
The most recent pushback on government intrusion
has shown that Apple is powerful enough to

40
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,650
stand up to even the FBI.

41
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,360
But how can Apple just deny access to the
government?

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,940
What does Tim Cook mean when he says they’re
unable to access phones produced by Apple?

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,530
How does encryption work?

44
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,400
