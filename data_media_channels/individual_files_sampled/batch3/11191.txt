which counter-terror police are investigating a major incident right now after two people were left critically ill in hospital following what's thought to have been exposure to an unknown substance the man and woman were found unconscious at a property about ten kilometres north of Salisbury that's where the former Russian double agent sir gates crippling his daughter were poisoned exactly four months ago let's try get a handle on this now we can talk to Artie's Polly Boyka hi there take us through what's been established so far well bear in mind it's a developing story and things are still pretty unclear but the latest is that according to Sky sources a sample of whatever has affected the pair has been sent to Porton down that is the government laboratory that identified the substance that was used on the scrip house four months ago as military-grade nerve agent it's just ten miles away from the village where the pair was found as you were saying but in another sign that this could be a very serious incident we've had a statement saying that the Metropolitan Police the counterterrorism police have now been drafted in to help the local police in Wiltshire with this investigation take a listen to what the Met Police had to say as you would expect given the recent events in Salisbury officers from the counterterrorism network are working jointly with colleagues from Wiltshire Police regarding the incident in Amesbury as Wiltshire police have stated they are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding the incident and will update the public as soon and as regularly as possible although in a sign perhaps of the confusion surrounding this case at the moment but conflicting reports because a little bit earlier somebody from the Wiltshire Police was talking to the BBC and they said that there's no reason to think that any of this is in any way connected to the poisoning of the script Isles back in March he told BBC wiltshire that I haven't seen anything in this incident yet that I would consider to be an overreaction it all seems fairly textbook that came from the police and crime Commissioner for Wiltshire but it is nevertheless quite peculiar and at least from when where we're looking at there are similarities in these two cases they contain many of the same elements the script pals were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury four months ago to this day and this new Amesbury case involves a man and a woman in their 40s who were found unconscious at a residential address on Saturday night they are now in a critical condition they're being treated at Salisbury District Hospital which is the very same hospital where the scribbles were treated they're receiving treatment for a sixth suspected exposure to an unknown substance and just like in the case with the script Isles police have cordoned off four areas of both Salisbury town and Amesbury which is the village where they were found although none of that they haven't said that that's connected to the case but people are linking it to it and understandably all of this is a source of alarm for the local people who live in and around that village and in Salisbury although at the moment public health England says it doesn't believe there is any sort of significant health risk to anybody in the area or to the wider public although that advice is being continually reassessed and updated but it's a story that's gathering pace the mystery is intensifying as these similarities between the two cases become more obvious yeah the authorities saying they're keeping an open mind of pains to say that of course but it's only very jittery all the same all right we'll stay across that any more developments we'll be right back with you for now though Polly Boyka in London thanks flat you
