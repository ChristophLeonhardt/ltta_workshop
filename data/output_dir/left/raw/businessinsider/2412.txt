innovation on political campaigns on

keys to success of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that type of</font>

be successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Barack Obama with the</font>

00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sort of traditional product marketing</font>

00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,540
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you release tools to enable</font>

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,660
people as opposed to gadgets to amaze

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,790
people i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that reprioritization of</font>

things is applied to politics and ends

14
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,940
of general consumer oriented marketing

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,270
and I think building the team in the

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">agency that is not only committed to the</font>

causes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we work on but also just</font>

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,039
really nimble I mean we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,300
ivory tower creative space we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,649
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish the documents that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

21
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,239
on the CEOs desk and make their way on

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,500
bookshelves<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,420
our hands dirty and that's both the<font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cycle the company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where relatively young</font>

25
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,440
and everything else but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,750
about sort of proving value really

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly as a way of building consensus</font>

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,259
in otherwise bureaucratic organizations

29
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:22,270
you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't whether it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be academia</font>

30
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,849
large nonprofits politics or you know

31
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cobra we don't exactly go for the easy</font>

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,450
sell but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on</font>

33
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,429
something a small sand box so to speak

34
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,170
and show value that's the best way of

35
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing the scope within an organization</font>

36
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:36,099
and the team is both sort of optimized

37
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that and the more we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get our</font>

38
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,039
hands dirty quickly the better the

39
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,280
engagements going to be Third Eye I

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,860
think applying these skills broadly and

41
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,979
and not focusing on just the obsession

42
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,539
around our political work but going<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

43
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,670
