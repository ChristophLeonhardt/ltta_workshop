My name is
Baltasar Kormakur.
I’m the director of "Adrift."
So now we see Shailene and
Sam playing Tami and Richard.
There — she’s dragging him.
He’s not as
courageous as she is.
She’s more like an
outgoing person.
He’s more like an
English gentleman.
And they recently met.
And they’re kind
of falling in love.
He’s excited about her
outgoingness and wildness.
We start with a crane here.
And there she jumps.
You know the
camera follows her.
We come up on Sam.
Tami!
And we hand over the camera
from a crane to a handheld.
And now we have a
handheld camera operator.
He’s trying to be
as steady as he can.
And then, whoop!
And he goes up with him
and bang into the water.
So I wanted to give the
audience the jump as well,
not only the actors.
And here we stay and
he’s looking for her
as he doesn’t know,
you know, maybe she
hurt herself when she
jumped down or something,
hit the bottom.
So he goes down
to look for her.
And she is just
pulling his tail
having a little meditation.
And here she has a rock
around her legs
because if not, she would
just be floating down the river.
There was a lot
of stream there.
And now we have
three moving elements
in the water, the camera
who is circling around them
and they’re circling around.
And by doing
this, I was hoping
to put you more into the
perspective of the actor
and give you the feeling of
being in the water with them
instead of just making
beauty shots
around them.
And you know, you see partly
the beautiful environment.
Like when I watch something
like that, I’m curious.
Where are they?
Where are these
rocks, you know?
It becomes more
interesting to me.
And it was actually quite
a tricky one to get.
We had to draft down
this river after driving
for hours up there.
It’s high up in the
mountains in Fiji
and the rocks around
there are so unique.
