our guest today is Alice Schroeder who wrote the best-selling book the snowball on Warren Buffett Alice what was your what surprised you the most after spending 15 months or 18 months with Warren well you know on television he has this awe-inspiring image he's this grandfatherly guy whose all-knowing and when you get to know him he's first of all he's he's quite vulnerable he's always got people around protecting him from confrontation and he's almost like a kid you know he wants everybody to be his parent and the other thing is he says he's incredibly tough he does not like for people to realize how tough he is and even ruthless because you know if he's buying everything in a bargain somebody's not making out on the other side but that kind of contradicts the grandfatherly so what does that mean he wants everyone to be his parent I mean actually certainly from the outside you feel like his whole code is personal responsibility my managers just do the right thing always I do the right thing always so what do you mean by that well ethically I think he's extremely responsible and he's very clear on what he takes responsibility for but he's he's you know he had a crummy childhood and I covered in the book a really ghastly and so when it comes to being shielded from people being angry at him for example he can't handle any kind of volatility or people blowing up their temper and so he's got what I call the praetorian guard around him and it's women you know who protect him from this and what was that childhood doing in snapchat yeah he had an emotionally abusive mother who used to scream at him and his sister that they were worthless they did not deserve to be alive they should be ashamed to exist and he said that by the time he was three years old he was broken and it could not be put back together well he certainly found a way to compensate for the worthless part I mean given one could say that yes but I it's interesting because personality is so the opposite I mean it just is so grounded and everything else is he always as charming as he is on TV and the charm is part of his personality there's times when you want to strangle the guy and yet he's charmingly irritating so it's just yeah he is very witty very charming very funny extraordinary now you had a falling out with him after the book came out what was that well you know hey I had a trial control over the book that was the deal and he cooperated with me throughout I told him that you know there were parts of it he wasn't gonna like and he read it and that was okay but then after it was published he stopped speaking to me and there's parts of it that are not flattering to him I portray his toughness I detail the reasons why his marriage fell apart and I think that's natural I be it's very uncomfortable for him on the other hand I walked into this situation I didn't know all these things and I had to write the book and so you know I I had to tell the truth that's your job when you're a journalist and if you read it beforehand what was it was it when other people got it and suddenly started it was shattered a little I believe so yeah yeah he's interested he didn't see that coming because of course obviously if you're opening up you have to tell that story and especially if he reads it and that's me suddenly you know he spent five years talking to me he laid himself out there he you know knew that I knew all these things and so I don't understand why it would be a surprise but you know I think the reality of it hit him in the face it's been you know it's been really awkward it's not fun to have worry about that angry at you believe me and is he still angry oh yeah yes oh yeah and so what's that like and do you feel like you stab him in the back no no I did exactly what I was supposed to do I wrote a truthful book he wanted to reconcile his public in private selves that's what he said and I believe this book is very fair and I think it will serve the reader and him well over time I'm really proud of this book so you know and and also I mean the horrible things are the myths shattering things so he's tough okay it's not the worst thing in the world and so it's not the guy only guy who's married failed as a result of work and so I mean these are whore are hardly horrible revelations that come out of this so hopefully you'll get over it you know even if he doesn't I did the right thing and that's what matters that's what's important you know it isn't fun to have word Buffett mad at you but you know I it would be less fun to write a book that was just you know a giant Valentine to him and then have to live with that the rest of my life right so a couple more things on Warren is there anything that he buys that resembles conspicuous consumption here's got 38 billion dollars or whatever it is if you buy anything other than coke airplanes he buys airplane flies not jets but he owns you know he owns that jets and through Berkshire and he likes to travel in style but what he really buys his companies you know Berkshire Hathaway where other people might collect cars or they might you know collect yachts he collects businesses that's his collection and he admires them he calls it a museum it's true but is there nothing I mean he doesn't have a big house somewhere or anything else nice car he's 47 Ferraris he doesn't care and in fact he's not visual at all his house has probably not been renovated in 40 years and he doesn't see things at one time on the phone I said you know worried what color is my hair because I just thought I'll give him a little test and there was this long silence and then he said not black you know because he just doesn't he's not aware of his surroundings he doesn't care last question much less relevant is he a good bridge player he's an excellent bridge player he plays with Sharon osburgh who's a two-time world champion and they're quite good great Thank You Ellis
