- Hey, guys, it's Jouelzy.
You can't really see my sweatshirt, but,
ooh, can you see it?
I now have this and Black is a Culture.
In not only sweatshirts, but this is a
cropped sweatshirt, and I love it.
So let's get into this actual discussion,
and remember you can always support
by shopping Smart Brown
Girl, and if you're new here,
definitely subscribe if
you enjoy the conversation,
even if you don't agree.
It's all about a critical dialogue,
so please do comment along
and engage, respectfully.
The other day on Twitter,
things took off, okay,
as people discussed, and uncovered,
popular influencers on the
'Gram, who were supposedly
changing their features
to appear more black,
I guess it is.
Now someone decides to coin
this as "N*ggerfishing",
and I don't know why, with
the vastness of the English
language, they decided
to go with the hard R,
to coin this frame, but
there has to be, girl,
there has to be a better
way to describe it.
Ooh, I'm just remiss to even call it that.
At the center of these
allegations is one particular
influencer, Emma Hallberg.
She is Swedish and
feeding into an aesthetic
that focuses on her wide
hips, and what appears to be
a braid out in her hair,
like some loose texture
in her hair, I guess.
And some actually see this woman as trying
to portray herself as black.
Now, most of the girls folks
were outing had slightly
tan skin, clearly Botoxed
lips, and some sort
of flimsy texture to their
hair, and in the world
that I live in, that does an
identifiable black woman make.
Like, sis, what, huh?
For me, the gag really
is, that they're feeding
into a racially ambiguous
image that plenty,
not to, I mean, I don't
want to pull that card,
but I mean I do think
plenty of black women feed
into, and have found a
way to profit from, it.
Now, Kylie Jenner's
plastic surgeon is so good
that the comments whenever
she's posted on a page
like The Shade Room have
plenty of black women
saying it doesn't matter
if she paid for it 'cause
she look good, she look good-good.
And particularly, a lot
of these black women
are influencers, with large followings,
who are promoting this message of,
like Kylie's current aesthetic,
looking good and therefore desirable.
And look, on the flip
we are here on YouTube,
where there are plenty of black women,
who I mean, I guess you could say,
they're enhancing or
slimming their features,
and as black women, I've
seen plenty of celebration
around BBLs and lib fillers
and the girls who relax their edges,
and there are very specific
looks that become popular.
Y'all can not convince me that,
actually let me not be
messy and say any names,
but it's an epidemic out here with
the light skin and wavy girl.
Who's very popular on this here platform,
especially if she is blogging
or vlogging with her
dark skinned boyfriend.
Trust you me, I am not camping
or defending Emma or any
of these white women,
cause this isn't an image
that I ever feed into.
I ain't fixin to touch those
snakey Taylor Swift ways with
a 10 foot pole, sis, I'm
never gonna be here for it.
But to begin with, I don't
even follow the I have
a black grandmother girls
that look like her, either.
And you know what I'm talking about.
Not that I want to antagonize
or attack other people,
and question their racial identity,
but a lot of this is the same thing
that puts silky hair textures at the top
of the natural hair community.
It's the same thing
that has us arguing over
who's black so we claim
outliers as empowering,
while turning a blind eye to black women
who don't walk this world
with light skin privilege.
I don't have anything
for these white women,
because if it's that easy for
them to plump up their lips,
and braid their hair at night,
for you to see them as black?
Well, sis, you were already
fetishing European features.
Sorry to tell you.
There's plenty of black women,
that have gotten rid of
their Negro nose nostrils.
There's a popular IG
influencer who definitely
is an African women, but over the years,
she's erased almost
all her ethnic features
to look like an alien of racial ambiguity.
She's constantly popping
up on my Explorer page
because so many people
that I know follow her
and support the image
that she is promoting.
I mean, there's a lot more nuances,
this a lot deeper discussion that
we can delve off from here,
because it is not one in
the same for a black woman
to rid herself of her features
as it is for a white woman
to benefit by adding on to her features,
or alluding that her features are this?
White supremacy always going to have us
in some sort of cluster fuck,
but the white woman gets to commodify
while the black woman hates herself,
and it's just not the same,
but it is all a function of the spectrum
of European standards of beauty.
None of this, none of this of what I see,
when y'all out with
these girls represents me
as a black woman.
None of these images, none of these girls,
none of the way these women represent,
tells me to love and find beauty in
the plethora of ways
that black women present.
It feeds into a very narrow
scope of desirability
that puts European features at the top.
And to keep it real with you,
that is a disservice to us all.
I spend less time gagging
over these white girls
and spend more time focusing
on the real black girls, okay?
Cause you know, we still have a problem.
We still have a problem with accepting
and finding beauty in a specific corner
of the black women community.
So you know, work on that, sis.
