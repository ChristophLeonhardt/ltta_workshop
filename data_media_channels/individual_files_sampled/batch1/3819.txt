well I mean Peter asked me early on in my tenure at Fox and we got past it and so those promotions and all that happened after we got past it but I was scared when it happened to me I was a second year reporter at Fox I wasn't the me that I am now I had no power in the industry at all and no power at Fox News I was working in the DC bureau and I was I was doing it I was doing well I was I was making my bones I was reporting on big cases at the Supreme Court using my legal background breaking news the Duke alleged rape case was a big case for me and and I got that one right and most reporters didn't it was good for me you know my career was going well and so when he started it wasn't clear like he was always body and had an inappropriate sense of humor but I've never been some people feel differently but I've never been somebody who really takes offense at that and so I was quick to write off the comments like oh that's just him so the harassment that I went through wasn't obviously harassment in the beginning and then it graduated you know it was it just got worse and worse and worse to the point where you couldn't deny and he was it was explicit quid pro quo sexual harassment which was you know basically you sleep with me and I'll give you a promotion and even in those moments I tried to laugh it off and pretend I wasn't hearing what I was hearing or try to pretend that I had misunderstood because I didn't want a direct confrontation with him you know I I didn't want to have to reject him explicitly and I think this is telling because a lot of women to whom this happens in the workplace have this calculation where you're thinking holy you know what my whole job is on the line right now the last thing I want to do is upset and reject my boss you know we generally want to charm our bosses and have them feel good about us and truly it the culmination of it was in his office when because you'd go in there and he'd shut the door and he'd locked the door it's terrifying and you would you would you would sort of shrug it off because he was known to be very paranoid about security but that feeling I'll never forget of like going in there and having him lock that door and then so it culminated in him trying to be with me physically and it was only at that point whereas you couldn't pretend it wasn't happening anymore that I really had to come to terms with it and I ran out of the guy's office he tried to grab me three times make out with me which he didn't but I had to shove him off of me and he came back and I shoved him again and he came back a third time and then when I shoved him off the third time he asked me when my contract was up oh my god Wow so how do you you clearly went on from that and I think in your book you talk about you distance yourself as much as you could from him after he's saying well I reported it to a supervisor who told me just to steer clear of him Wow which really I mean at the time seemed like good advice because it was a good way to navigate forward but in retrospect was terrible terrible advice you
