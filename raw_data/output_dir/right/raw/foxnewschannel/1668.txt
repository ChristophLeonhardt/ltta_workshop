00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,420
ALL, NOW HE SAYS IT'S A GRAVE

165
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,388
THREAT TO U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY

166
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:37,790

ECONOMIC SPHERE THAT THEY ARE

168
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,227

173
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,870
ASSUMING IT HASN'T ALREADY, THEY

174
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,605
ARE OBVIOUSLY OUR MAIN RIVAL IN

186
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:11,657

NICETIES AND THEY BASICALLY

188
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:14,693
IGNORED THIS GROWING

190
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:19,031
SAID, THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS HAVE

191
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:22,868
BEEN TOTALED BETWEEN

192
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:23,535
200,000,000,600,000,000,000

193
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:24,236
ANNUALLY IN OUR MOST CUTTING

194
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,038
EDGE TECHNOLOGIES.

195
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:26,906
>> Tucker: YOU WOULD THINK

196
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,174
THAT AMERICAN INDUSTRY FROM HOME

197
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:31,143
THIS DATA IS BEING STOLEN WOULD

198
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,144
BE COMPLAINING IN PUBLIC, BUT

199
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:34,446
THEY ARE NOT.

200
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:35,247
>> THEY ARE NOT.

201
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,215
THERE WAS A MEETING LAST YEAR

202
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:38,851
WITH A LOT OF THE TECH CHIEFS

203
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:39,551
WITH TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE

204
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:41,654
AND BASICALLY ALL OF THEM SAID

205
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:44,056
YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO

206
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,291
CUT OFF THIS CHINESE THEFT OF

207
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:45,691
TECHNOLOGY.

208
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:47,559
THEY ARE JUST PILLAGING

209
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,895
EVERYTHING THAT SILICON VALLEY

210
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,230
HAS AND THERE HAS BEEN LITERALLY

211
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,565
NOTHING DONE TO TRY AND STOP

212
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,067
THAT.

213
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,235
>> Tucker: ABSOLUTELY

214
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:56,635
TERRIFYING.

215
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,470
VERY QUICKLY, DO YOU THINK I'M

216
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,605
ALMOST A RHETORICAL QUESTION,

217
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,440
BUT THE RELENTLESS FOCUS ON

218
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,207
RUSSIA HACKING OUR ELECTION

219
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:04,043
WHATEVER THAT MEANS, DOES NOT

220
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:05,144
DETRACT FROM OUR AWARENESS IN

221
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:08,480
OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CHINA?

222
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,914
>> ABSOLUTELY.

223
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:10,282
RUSSIA DOES POSE A THREAT BUT

224
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:11,450
IT'S A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF A

225
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:11,784
THREAT.

226
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:13,652
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT

227
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:14,453
THE TWO ECONOMIES.

228
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:15,688
THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS SEVEN

229
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:18,457
TIMES SMALLER THAN THE CHINESE

230
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:20,092
ECONOMY, SO THEY ARE NOT AS

231
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:22,027
GREAT A THREAT AS CHINA, SO IT'S

232
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:22,661
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE

233
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:25,664
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TAKE

234
00:06:25,664 --> 00:00:00,000
ACTION TO STOP THE CHINESE
