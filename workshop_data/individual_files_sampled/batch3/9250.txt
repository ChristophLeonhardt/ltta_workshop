♪ ♪ Martha: IT IS ELECTION NIGHT AGAIN, WE ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE PRIMARY RACES IN SEVEN STATES WITH THE BALANCE OF POWER IN CONGRESS UP FOR GRABS. ATTENTION BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ENDORSED CANAVAN DAN DONOVAN AND MICHAEL GRAHAM WHO IS FIGHTING TO TAKE BACK HIS SEAT. YOU'RE NOW EXCLUSIVELY NEW YORK REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE MICHAEL GRAHAM. GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. Martha: IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT YOUR RECENT HISTORY. IT'S BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU SPENT SEVEN MONTHS IN PRISON FOR TAX EVASION. I KNOW THAT YOU FEEL THAT THAT CONVICTION THAT YOU WERE RAILROADED, THAT IT WAS UNJUST. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE, DON BLANKENSHIP HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE, HE SPENT SOME TIME IN JAIL, FELT THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG. IF IT DID NOT TURN OUT WORKING WELL FOR HIM. STATEN ISLAND AND BROOKLYN, THEY GOT TO KNOW ME PERSONALLY. NO ONE DOES CONSTITUENT SERVICES THE WAY I DID WHETHER IT WAS SUPER STORM SANDY OR REBUILDING THE MARINA, BRINGING MONEY HOME FOR HOSPITALS, PEOPLE GOT TO KNOW ME ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AND I DON'T THINK THEY LIKED THE POLITICAL CORRUPTION GETTING INTO OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND I HAVE THREE DELIVERY BOYS OFF THE BOOKS AT A RESTAURANT. IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. REJECTING THAT. THEY DON'T LIKE THAT. Martha: YOU HAVE SAID PEOPLE HAVE SAID IN TALKING ABOUT YOU THAT YOU ARE MORE TRUMP THAN TRUMP. WHY DID HE ENDORSE HER OPPONENT? I THINK THAT'S OBVIOUS. BY THE ESTABLISHMENT THAT CONTROLS THE HOUSE, LEADERSHIP AND SO ON. THEY DON'T WANT THE PRESIDENT GOING AGAINST THEIR INCUMBENTS AND ULTIMATELY THE PRESIDENT NEEDS FROM THE TEAM THAT'S IN THE PRESIDENT I THINK TO GO AGAINST THE SITTING INCUMBENT IN TO ME IT'S REALLY NOT A SURPRISE AT ALL. FAMILIES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED? ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THOSE KIDS ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THOSE KID KIDS? WHAT I THINK IS WRONG IS THAT WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT ALL 12,000. RIGHT NOW I THINK I REALLY THINK THE LEFT IS ONLY PLAYING THIS UP BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT OTHER 10,000 THAT CAME BY THEMSELVES? HOW ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE RIPPED OUT OF THEIR MOTHER'S ARMS IN GUATEMALA OR HONDURAS OR WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM AND THEN STUFFED IN A TRUNK, SOME OF THEM, TO CROSS THE DESERT BY SMUGGLERS AND COYOTES. I THINK IF WE WANT TO CARE ABOUT CHILDREN WE HAVE TO CLOSE OUR BORDERS ONCE AND FOR ALL SO THAT THEY NEVER MAKE THAT JOURNEY IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THAT JOURNEY, WHICH IS SO DANGEROUS AND OFTEN ENDS IN RAPE FOR BEING SOLD IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING OR OTHER THINGS, IF WE REALLY CARE ABOUT THEM THEN WE HAVE TO CLOSE OUR BORDERS ONCE AND FOR ALL SO THEY NEVER MAKE THAT HORRIFIC JOURNEY. Martha: MAX ROSE IS AN ARMY VETERAN. HE WOULD BE THE DEMOCRAT IF YOU DO WIN TONIGHT, THAT'S WHO YOU WOULD RUN AGAINST. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RUN AGAINST HIM? I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU WOULD SAY THAT. THEY HAVE A PRIMARY TONIGHT AND THE LAST TIME I CHECKED WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO THE DEMOCRAT IS GOING TO BE BUT WHOEVER IT IS I'M GOING TO RUN EXACTLY THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS RAN. I WON FOR ELECTIONS FOR ONE REASON, BECAUSE I WORKED MY TAIL OFF. THE ISSUES IN A MAKE SURE THEY GET TO KNOW ME. AND I THINK THAT HARD WORK IS MARGIN TONIGHT. Martha: WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN AS
