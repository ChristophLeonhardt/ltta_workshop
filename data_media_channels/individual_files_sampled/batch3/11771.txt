a very crucial moment for Syria right now many believe that the country's fate will depend on how the agreement regarding the buffer zone around Italy province in Syria is fulfilled there are two major deadlines first of all highly weapons should be removed from this supposed 15 to 20 kilometer deeper zone around the province by October 10th which is today and within the next five days all the militants including radical extremist groups should also leave this zone so that it may start functioning properly we've talked about the progress with russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and he has sounded rather optimistic the agreements are being fulfilled with our Turkish partners having the main role they're actively fighting to get all groups to cooperate our information confirms that process is going on October the 15th is when the demilitarized zones will start functioning but a day or two's difference will not matter the quality of the work is much more important and we support them it is very hard to verify independently this information but we hear from several opposition groups including those inside the province and based outside Syria and also from the Turkish media that tanks Rockers missiles and multiple launch systems have already been removed from the buffer zone and it may sound like a very positive achievement but we also hear that several radical extremist groups do not agree to participate in this initiative supported by the Syrian government by the way and agreed between Putin and their Dogon so this is why we should talk about the success with a certain care the idea of the buffer zone around the adlib province was the first of all avoid open military confrontation that many agreed would be a bloody and devastating one Italy province is still home to many civilians including children this is why it's very important to act very carefully regarding this large last area inside Syria controlled by the anti-government forces and this is why many believe that fate of Syria and whether we can talk about the end or continuation of the almost 8 year long devastating conflict in the country depends on how things develop in Italy province right now you
