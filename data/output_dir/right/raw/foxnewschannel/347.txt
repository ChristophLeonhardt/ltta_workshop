1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:01,220
SUPREME COURT.

2
00:00:01,221 --> 00:00:02,521
JOINING US NOW WITH PERSPECTIVE,

3
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:04,924
DANA PRIO, HOST OF THE DAILY

4
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:05,658
BRIEFING ON FOX NEWS.

5
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:08,027
SHE JOINS US FROM NEW YORK.

6
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:09,728
DANA, LISTEN, YOU HAVE MORE

7
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:10,796
PERSONAL CONNECTION AND

8
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:11,997
NETWORKING WITH THE KAVANAUGHS

9
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:13,365
THAN MOST OF US DO, HAVING

10
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:15,501
WORKED IN BUSH 43 WHITE HOUSE.

11
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:16,602
HOW DO YOU THINK THE FAMILY MUST

12
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:17,837
FEEL AFTER WHAT THEY'VE BEEN

13
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:20,239
THROUGH TO GET TO THIS DAY?

14
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,308
>> POSSIBLY COMPLETELY SHATTERED

15
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,844
IN TERMS OF EXHAUSTION.

16
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,278
RELIEVED, POSSIBLY A LITTLE

17
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,880
EUPHORIA AS WELL.

18
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:30,483
AND ALSO MAYBE QUITE REFLECTIVE.

19
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:31,250
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS

20
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,419
YOU SAW FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH

21
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,521
WHEN HE TESTIFIED IS HE TALKED

22
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:37,022
ABOUT HIS FAITH.

23
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:39,859
HE HAS A STRONG NATE IN

24
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:39,892
HE HAS A STRONG FATE IN

25
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:39,925
HE HAS A STRONG FAIE IN

26
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:39,959
HE HAS A STRONG FAITHIN

27
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,793
HE HAS A STRONG FAITH IN THE

28
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:42,261
LORD AND HE WAS RELYING ON THE

29
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:43,329
FAITH TO GET HIM THROUGH.

30
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,164
HE ALSO REVERES THE

31
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:46,165
CONSTITUTION, LOVES THE

32
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,600
CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW.

33
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:49,401
AND MAYBE AFTER TONIGHT, I THINK

34
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:50,736
HE'S PROBABLY THINKING AHEAD TO

35
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:53,472
THE CASES THAT WILL COME BEFORE

36
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:54,607
THE SUPREME COURT, THE MAJOR

37
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:57,243
ISSUES THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS TO

38
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:58,878
GRAPPLE WITH WHEN IT COMES TO

39
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,012
LIBERTY, WHEN IT COMES TO

40
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,047
PRIVACY, ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT

41
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:03,315
THE COUNTRY IS FACING.

42
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:05,518
I HOPE THAT HE AND HIS WIFE AND

43
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,620
DAUGHTERS AND FAMILY CAN TAKE A

44
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,388
MOMENT TO CELEBRATE.

45
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:11,457
THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

46
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,992
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A

47
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:13,492
LOT.

48
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:14,927
AND I THINK WHEN HE WROTE THE OP

49
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:16,862
ED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

50
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:18,564
THAT SOME PEOPLE LOVED, SOME

51
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:21,233
PEOPLE CHRIS

52
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:21,267
PEOPLE CRIIS

53
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:21,901
PEOPLE CRITICIZED, I THINK HE

54
00:01:21,902 --> 00:01:23,469
WAS TRYING TO SIGNAL THAT THE

55
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,205
JUDGE THAT HE WAS FOR 12 YEARS

56
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:27,072
WITH OVER 300 OPINIONS, THAT

57
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:28,107
THAT IS THE KIND OF JUDGE HE

58
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:29,542
WILL BE ON THE SUPREME COURT.

59
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:30,843
SO I THINK SHANNON, THAT'S

60
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:33,612
PROBABLY WHAT IS ON HIS MIND

61
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:37,850
RIGHT NOW, POSSIBLY ALSO A LOT

62
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,451
OF GRATITUDE FOR THE PRESIDENT

63
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:41,053
WHO FIRST HIRED HIM IN THE BUSH

64
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:42,955
43 WHITE HOUSE AND PUT HIM ON

65
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:44,256
THE CIRCUIT COURT, THEN THE

66
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:45,691
PRESIDENT WHO STUCK BY HIM AND

67
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:46,859
NOMINATED HIM AND STUCK BY HIM

68
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,827
AND THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO

69
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:51,163
GOES NOW TONIGHT TO KANSAS FOR A

70
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:54,366
RALLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT

71
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:55,968
CAMPAIGN PROMISE KEPT AND ALSO

72
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:58,270
JUST A UNIFIED REPUBLICAN PARTY

73
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:03,008
UNLIKE WE HAVE SEEN IN POSSIBLY

74
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:03,609
10 YEARS.

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,811
CHRIS:  DANA, I WANT TO ASK YOU

76
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:07,980
ON A KIND OF PERSONAL LEVEL

77
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:08,681
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH BECAUSE

78
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:11,150
YOU DID WORK WITH HIM IN THE

79
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:12,384
BUSH 43 WHITE HOUSE AND FOR

80
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:14,119
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN

81
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,655
FOLLOWING HIM IN PUBLIC ON TV,

82
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:18,991
THERE REALLY HAVE BEEN THREE

83
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:19,992
BRETT KAVANAUGHS WE'VE SEEN.

84
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:22,928
FIRST OF ALL, THE LEGAL SCHOLAR,

85
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:24,563
IMMENSELY COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING

86
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:26,832
JUDICIAL DECISIONS, RULINGS,

87
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,168
PRECEDENTS AND HIS ORIGINAL

88
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:30,135
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BRIEFING,

89
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:31,837
THEN THE INTERVIEW WITH OUR

90
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:32,738
COLLEAGUE, MARTHA McCALLUM

91
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:34,506
WHERE HE SEEMED VERY

92
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,675
CONSTRAINED, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,

93
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:37,876
UNDERSTANDABLY SO, DEALING WITH

94
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:39,812
THE CHARGES AND THEN THE KIND OF

95
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:41,380
KAVANAUGH UNPLUGGED THAT WE SAW

96
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,249
IN HIS SECOND JUDICIARY

97
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,318
COMMITTEE TESTIMONY WHEN HE WAS

98
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,254
VERY FIERY AND REALLY TOOK ON

99
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,656
THE DEMOCRATS IN A VERY

100
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:51,123
CONTENTIOUS WAY.

101
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:53,692
YOUR VIEW, WHICH IS THE REAL

102
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:54,159
BRETT KAVANAUGH?

103
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,729
>> WELL, I THINK, LOOK, HE'S A

104
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,796
TOTAL HUMAN, RIGHT.

105
00:02:57,797 --> 00:02:59,398
THE FULL SPECTRUM.

106
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,166
ESSEX SEEDINGLY GRACIOUS, ALSO

107
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,570
AN EXCEEDING INTELLECTUAL.

108
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,905
I REMEMBER ONE THING, CHRIS, IN

109
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,474
2005 I WAS A SPOKESPERSON FOR

110
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:09,008
JOHN ROBERTS.

111
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:12,177
HE HAD JUST BEEN NOMINATED TO

112
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:14,279
REPLACE JUSTICE SANDRA DAY

113
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,914
O'CONNOR WHO IF YOU REMEMBER,

114
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:17,983
SHE RESIGNED AND IT WAS QUITE A

115
00:03:17,984 --> 00:03:18,951
SURPRISE TO EVERYONE BUT

116
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,819
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH HAD A

117
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,821
LIST OF POSSIBLE NOMINEES.

118
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:24,189
JOHN ROBERTS WAS A CHOICE.

119
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,190
I REMEMBER AS A PRESS OFFICER I

120
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:26,959
WAS GETTING SO MANY QUESTIONS,

121
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,594
SO MANY HE LEGAL QUESTIONS, I

122
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:29,228
COULDN'T ANSWER.

123
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,663
I'LL NEVER FORGET, IT WAS A

129
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:45,477
ABOUT 7:30 AT NIGHT, I WENT TO

130
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:47,012

134
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,318

139
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:01,627

OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

143
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:08,434
