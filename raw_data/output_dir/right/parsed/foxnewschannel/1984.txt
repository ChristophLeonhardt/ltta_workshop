SOME NUMBERS ROLLING IN
WEST VIRGINIA WE ARE ALL VERY
INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THAT'S
GOING TO WORK OUT SO WE WILL GET
THOSE UP ON THE BOARD AS SOON AS
WE HAVE THEM.
IN THE MEANTIME, THIS BREAKING
STORY.
YOU MAY REMEMBER NEW YORK
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SNYDERMAN
GOING AFTER HARVEY WEINSTEIN,
ONE OF THE MANY PEOPLE THAT HE
HAS GONE AFTER AS AG IN
NEW YORK, BUT HE REALLY WAS A
CHAMPION, WE THOUGHT, FOR THE
#MeToo MOVEMENT.
>> WOMEN WERE COERCED INTO
FACILITATING HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S
MISCONDUCT, SOMETIMES THEY WERE
TARGETS THEMSELVES.
IF THEY REFUSED, THEY WERE
THREATENED.
>> Martha: HE HAS GONE
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH POWERFUL
POLITICIANS INCLUDING AT TIMES
PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF, WHO
TWEETED BACK IN 2013 WEINER IS
GONE, SPITZER IS GONE.
NEXT WILL BE LIGHTWEIGHT AG ERIC
