12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,289
fun is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second part of that I wanted</font>

14
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:43,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they</font>

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,980
had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance to</font>

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,360
to accomplish all the needs that they

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">might have dreamed of when they were</font>

18
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,180
little really glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're running</font>

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,610
for them they do some great work and

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,280
they've been involved in raising pretty

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,600
substantial funds<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the cause of</font>

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,480
cancer over a long period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,650
unfortunately we've had a lot of cancer

24
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,030
in my family a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks that passed</font>

25
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,160
away so I think in this would be a great

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to support that about hopefully</font>

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,100
solve your cancer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got more</font>

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">money to do that when</font>

29
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm preparing for the marathon first by</font>

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,430
running a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half-marathon high-tech</font>

31
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,180
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> just completed but then</font>

32
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,950
following up a rigid schedule which I'm

33
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure I will break but a rigid schedule</font>

34
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,240
of about three<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four times of running</font>

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,560
a week for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next about what is it 16</font>

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
18 weeks up into the marathon and

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
hopefully it'll be enough how am I

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,310
preparing I think it's mostly mentally

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,810
right so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually getting myself</font>

40
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,530
ready to run I haven't started yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,000
begin thinking about

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,800
again I'm very very anxious the most

43
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,460
time ever one is like three miles so I

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,080
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm definitely a long way to go</font>

45
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,810
before I'm ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the marathon in</font>
