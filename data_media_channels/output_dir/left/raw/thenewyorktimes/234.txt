1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
“I would build a great wall,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,660
and nobody builds walls
better than me, believe me.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,380
And I’ll build them
very inexpensively.”

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,840
This was President Trump’s
campaign announcement

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,100
in June of 2015.

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,100
Since then,
President Trump’s efforts

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,260
to build his
long-touted wall

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,480
have run into
political realities.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,870
He doesn’t have the funding,

10
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,690
and he couldn’t
reach a compromise.

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,900
“Look, I made it so,
so clear to the president

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,760
that there is not going
to be a wall.”

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,160
And his voter base is
beginning to take notice.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,140
“Right now, if I were
a betting woman,

15
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,470
I don’t think we’re
getting a wall.”

16
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,680
So Trump instead has tried
to use a series of distractions

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,800
to get around the fact

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,650
that his border barrier
is running behind.

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,460
President Trump had
eight wall prototypes built

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,470
near the border.

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,630
But that’s where
construction has stalled.

22
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,170
These monoliths stand
as a $20 million testament

23
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,670
to his ambitions,
but not much more.

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,860
President Trump has repeatedly
stated that construction is

25
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,770
already under way for the wall.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,840
“We need the wall.

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,728
We’ve started building the wall.”

28
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:04,897
“We’re going to have the wall.

29
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:06,003
We’ve already
started building it.”

30
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:07,420
“We started building our wall.

31
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,250
I’m so proud of it.”

32
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,830
But it’s almost entirely
routine maintenance

33
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,820
being done on existing
sections of the wall,

34
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,050
plus 33 miles of new fencing.

35
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,820
When efforts to fund
the wall failed,

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,910
President Trump said he wanted
the National Guard deployed,

37
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,040
a move he said was significant.

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,780
“Until we can have a
wall and proper security,

39
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,070
we’re going to be guarding
our border with the military.

40
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,300
That’s a big step.

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,820
We really haven’t done
that before, or certainly

42
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,710
not very much before.”

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,630
But this is not a dramatic move.

44
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,780
Both President Obama
and President Bush

45
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,511
did the same
during their terms.

46
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,520
Trump suggested
the military could

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,610
pay for the wall with
part of their budget,

48
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,440
a proposal with few backers.

49
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,130
“We can’t rob money and resources

50
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,010
from the military that
so desperately needs them

51
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,170
at a time of growing
international crisis.”

52
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,070
President Trump said he
was willing to compromise

53
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,460
for wall funding in the
2018 budget bill in exchange

54
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,970
for protecting young
undocumented immigrants

55
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,630
known as DACA recipients.

56
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,090
“The Democrats would not do it.”

57
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,350
But in reality, Trump was the one
who ended the DACA program

58
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,520
in the first place.

59
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,180
Trump has tried various ways
of getting Mexico to pay,

60
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,930
including a border tax
on Mexican goods

61
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,180
or through renegotiations

62
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,270
of the North American
Free Trade Agreement,

63
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,940
also known as Nafta.

64
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,211
But Mexico has
yet to pay a dime.

65
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,180
“Isn’t it true at this
point that Mexico

66
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,060
is just not going to pay
for that wall?”

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,340
“I’m not going to go beyond what
the president’s already said.

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,410
I think he still has
plans to look

69
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,300
at potential ways
for that to happen.”

70
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,670
But this kind of
hedging is a far cry

71
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,140
from Trump’s
original promise.

72
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,110
“I will have Mexico
pay for that wall.

73
00:02:49,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Mark my words.”
