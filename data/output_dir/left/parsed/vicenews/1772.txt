his last year in office President Obama
has made gun control a top priority

actions that include more background
checks and more money for mental health

responsible gun owners who grieve with
us every time this happens to join with
us to demand something better while the

reduce gun violence critics say he's
gone too far others say the president
hasn't gone far enough we want to know
what you think about guns so add vice
news on skype and then on thursday at
seven p.m. eastern time join me in some
