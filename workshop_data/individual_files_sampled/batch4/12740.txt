Michael on this couch in his studio this couch has kind of become a staple of the conversation don't sit this close to Michael honest comfort I mean I've said numerous times before can we just give me some spaces to yourself yes I have to say that to him repeatedly earlier he was trying on shirts and he's like what should I wear or should I wear this and I'm like yes where all of the church just cover it all up I was a part of the Valentine's Day promo I don't need to relive that nightmare ah anyway but it's good to have you here it's nice to be here as always yes it has although I see you from time to time while you're wondering people wonder what I do around here that's an important job somebody's got to do it we got our first question you ready I'm ready great this question is from Ben he says hi Andrew in the past you've said that works of fiction like our theory in legends helped bring you over to Christianity can you give us some more details about that yeah sure I mean I started out reading the tough guy writers because I was looking kind of kind of from male role models and a lot of their books were based on Arthurian legends so I turned to our 30 and legends and all the Arthurian legends our center around Christian iconography the Holy Grail and things like that that ultimately led me to read more about Christianity just because I wanted to be a writer and know more about the culture to understand the background of it yeah it seemed that this was at the core of every work I saw and I just thought well if I'm going to be a writer I want to know what people are writing about that's when my my father caught me reading the New Testament and screamed at me for half an hour yeah absolutely he was he was afraid I would convert cilium a question from Stephen who do you see playing you Ben and Michael and the unlock the ride is daily wire biopic I think for me it does Bruce Willis definitely because he's got he's got the hairline yeah I you know I don't know they'd have to find a young Jeff Goldblum for for Ben that's an excellent actually suggestion you better answer than mine I will see to your answer and and Noel's you gotta be kidding at me oh yeah Scott there's the Donald Trump supporter wait no we need somebody young and vibrant like you know gosh who's that girl who played the play himself he's not you probably want to be that person that played themselves the late and wonderful Fred Thompson played himself in in a movie that's right that's right is that how he got his acting started I believe did he I think that's how he got his acting start we'll have to google that all right but if you want to get you know experience in acting and writing like yourself yes should someone like me just go check out Scotia yeah you gotta go to

for now that's true I mean you can get those things where you throw the ball up and catch him at cop I think that's about it the next question is from Phoebe she says when I was in public high school I had trouble reading so I was taken out of class every day and put in a small room to work on my reading my dad thinks this was abuse how can we help kids like me I do not think that that's abuse I mean I don't know but it doesn't seem like it's abused very tough if you're especially if you're in a public school there aren't that many facilities for you I think that what you need is each school should have a special learning teacher and if they can't handle you they should move you to schools for teach for people like yourself there's a lot of private schools specifically here in the LA area that I've heard about that have kind of those types of teachers for kids that are that are struggling in a certain topic or they help them do their homework in like the kind of after-hours time and fair schools will tell you we can't handle what you've got you know you've got to go to a different place but but look I think you know you have to give this school some slack when you call it abuse to give the kids special lessons in permanent school a butte that's not what abuse looks like it looks a lot worse Joel says mr. prime lol you should say you're borderline Catholic have you looked at or Fatah at the Orthodox I'm under the oriental branch includes Coptic Ethiopian Armenian Syrian it is well you know ever since I expressed my dissatisfaction with the mainstream Episcopal Church because they've been talking about taking gender gendered words out of their Book of Common Prayer which is absurd not because God has a gender but because the Bible has decreed that this is a good way of referring to God ever since I've said that people have been recommending their churches I've got a lot of recommendations and the Catholics you know the Catholics and the Mormons they came after me hard but I have a certain problem that I actually discusses the Noles for several hours the other day which is that I do not want anyone else describing the moral moral to me in such a way that I can't override them if my conscience and scripture reading and theology reading declares that they're right but they're wrong and I'm right I'm hooked I'm Huck Finn and in the end I'll go to hell if it means doing the right thing all right I'm so sorry the Mormons can keep trying Aaron says Jessica always makes your hair look stunning she does I have a thing that was for you or for me no no it's me I think yeah I have a full head of hair I looked exactly we look almost exactly alike before Jessica yeah and then I this is how I turn this is all contour and curling iron folks Veronica says Lord man y'all I cannot read these give us writers some practical tips how do you manage multiple projects at a time and how do you maintain your narrative voice while reading other authors that's we're actually really good that's a very I find that I don't even write fiction like you do but when I'm writing an opinion piece there's all the words or the tweets or the articles that I've read from other people including here at the Daily Wired that I want to make sure I'm not just projecting their thoughts and get mine out on paper so how do you do that in your political writing and in your fiction well first of all let's practice when I was coming up every writer steals from other writers as they come up you read Hemingway you write like Hemingway for a couple of months you read Henry James suddenly all your sentences get very complex but over time you start to develop a natural voice which is usually for most writers it's usually several voices it's not just one voice you have a number of voices that you can turn to and even imitate other voices if you need to but it is something that you learned that's something that you learn over time I forgot what the first part of that question was it was asked how do you how do you manage multiple project that may be the very the single hardest thing I do because I do have to do multiple projects you have to separate them it is more tiring in a day to do three projects than it is to do one project over the same amount of time if you have to keep changing your mind it's a lot of mental effort so I just I schedule my time very very carefully I know exactly how much time I have I know exactly what I'm gonna use it for I know exactly where I'm gonna get rest and stop and I'm not afraid to stop if I have to and that's that those are the things you learn in over time boss and friend of yours Ben Shapiro has said that you are the most scheduled person he has ever met yeah I am a very very disciplined person because you know the day has a beginning it has an end and you want to get as much in as possible all righty Evan says fearless leader can you do the can-can I hope that's for you but if it's for me no no no I should say I can't can't Ryan says hi Andrew is it possible for an author to create and write for a character that is more intelligent than them does this question even make sense yeah it makes absolute sense it's it is indeed it is possible I mean you do it through reading people who are more I don't have this problem cuz there is nobody more intelligence right you mean you read it you read it do the research and find out how we would say the best kind of research I find begins with finding somebody you can talk to and speaking to him directly because people use slang they use words that nobody else uses research is really key to doing this stuff but you can write anybody you know this is one of the things that drives me crazy about this kind of intersectional movement when they say actors can't play you know a white person can play a black person yeah of course I can write about anybody I can write anybody and if you could if a man can write a woman you can write anybody because that's the that is the biggest distance between two people is gender that's a good point Raymond says Andy millennial what didn't we do tons better with crime and economy if we got rid of the big cities can everyone from on top and get everyone from like I think he means off of being on top right you know it's funny I'm not particularly a city mouse though I've spent a lot of my time in cities but cities have a lot to offer and people like cities you know I think when people are brought together who have similar ideas similar thoughts when they when they can argue when they can associate with each other good things come of it I mean when we think of the great moments like the Renaissance and Victorian England there's always a city very much involved and there were always people like Wordsworth one of my heroes who goes off into the country and says you know what I'm gonna do this my own way William Faulkner goes off and does that but a lot of people hang around cities yeah cities come with problems they come with problems like crime those problems I have to say they can be dealt with when you look at New York great city very low crime ever since Giuliani took care of it there with his with Bratton and his police chiefs so I just think these are problems that come up but the problem shouldn't get rid of the source of so much creativity originality and humanity alright Luke says if you could enslave anyone to do a podcast at the David Lee wire who would it be I would never enslave anyone I you know I don't know you know the podcast is a very strange form I mean you think of sort of you know think of guys who were eloquent and interesting like Jordan Peterson we had him over the other day and he was great you know but you don't know if they're gonna do a podcast well when I sat down to do it I had no idea whether I would be any good at it or not you know it's just a very very specific form so you want people who feel comfortably I wouldn't enslave anybody's you want somebody who feels comfortable somebody who is really gonna be good not just one day because anybody can do it for one day but something's gonna come on every day and have something new to say as things change and I wasn't sure that was suitable for me as someone who likes to sit and think about things before I opened my big mouth so I so I'm not sure which people would be great I think norm MacDonald's who I think does have a podcast I'd love to have him here alright hey norm if you're watching come on over set you up with a god-king right exactly he loves we all love norm ago richard says do you use an outline or just start writing oh man I'm a big outliner I think yes I think people I'm for fiction I think people who don't outline are out of their minds because you can get you really can get like 300 pages into something and realize oh my gosh if I didn't put the gun here on page three it's not gonna be here in pasted 300 in the whole story doesn't make sense you have to go back and break it down it's not like screenwriting where you can just switch things around you really have to go through every page and make sure everything fits so outlines are incredibly important to me they allow me most importantly to just write which is what I love outlining is the most boring part of my job but once it's done I can just write and so every day is a joy it's like a road map yeah and I can change it in any time I want but that's no change the one always your answers Spencer says in your opinion how can we best discover God's will for our lives how should we distinguish God's will for us from what near happens to us right I mean I think that this is a very very difficult problem you really have to learn how to listen for God how to talked to God and how not to take coincidences as God's will listen God is always operating in your life and what you're trying to do is you're trying to hook your will into his you're trying to do his will instead of yours which frequently is just broken I mean this is what I find I find my own will is broken I want things from myself I shouldn't have I want to do try things that I know I'm not going to be able that ultimately I know I'm not going to be able to do whereas if I listen to God's will I find that I can do things I never thought I could do and I can make things work out that shouldn't work out at all and so then that's what you want to do and I think you do it's just the way you do it with any human being really you talk to someone and you start to listen to the tone of their voice and when they're telling you something that you need to listen to and it really is practice over time you should not you should never think that the things that happen are necessarily written in stone and you should certainly never think the coincidence is a revelation it really has to do with communicating with God in your life okay Anthony says hey andrew is an artist that is conservative do you believe that conservative artists need to be more like I do not know how to pronounce his name we're told breakfast okay there we go it's in create art that promotes conservative you know I think that what what we need is we need conservative artists we don't need concede artists who are conservatives we didn't don't need conservatives to create art or Christian it's so bad Christian music almost all political art is bad what you want is somebody who has a conservative point of view to create the art that his muse or God gives him to create that's what you want and one of the reasons that conservative art and is so bad is because first of all we don't have the studio's to make a lot of it so you get that one guy who just comes in but secondly because we wanted to communicate we want conservative art to look like conservative life it doesn't Shakespeare doesn't look like conservative life Tosca doesn't look like conservative life great stories one of the most conservative one of my favorite works of my life times The Sopranos which is filled with nudity murder you know the filthy language it's a deeply deeply conservative and instructive piece of work and that's what you need and it takes an artist to do that not a conservative all right so speaking of being an artist wanted to take like art classes I'm gonna figure out hobby professionally they gotta go to skills and skill sure it's a terrific thing it's an online learning platform with over 20,000 classes in just about everything business design technology you get the whole class an expert teaches it in a series

they go along and whether you're trying to deepen your professional skill set start a side business or just explore a new passion Skillshare is there to keep you learning and thriving I have tested their things just for my audience I tested their writing lessons and they're very very good I've looked at things for myself like how to do a podcast when we wanted to do another Kingdom right now I'm looking at a lot of their music videos you too can join the millions of students already learning on Skillshare with a special offer get two months of Skillshare for just 99 cents that's amazing skill

Skillshare comm slash Andrew go to Skillshare calm slash Andrew to start your two months now that's skill share calm slash Andrew Andrew really how do we stop California what do you mean Veronica we live here you can destroy us she said she read today that San Francisco is registering illegals to vote and what can we the people do to fight against this and the other awful things our state does well first I think what we should do is take a bandsaw along the border and just cut it until a switch goes out to see you make sure I'm in Nevada when are you state the breakup of these states I believe in doing anything we can to stop California from being what it is it is the worst it's one of the worst run states in the Union it would be paradise if left us weren't in charge of it it could be so much more than it is on the drought is the fault of the droughts we have of the fault of left is not that there aren't droughts here but the how bad they are is their fault that San Francisco is now just a cesspool it's one of the most beautiful cities in the world and it looks like garbage la is a homeless center it is just disgusting and the fact that they can keep doing it while people don't don't pay any attention to it the fact that we have no media here that covers it whether they just don't they just hide it all and blame right-wingers for everything so I think what what can we do busting it up is one place to start but then the problem with that my only negative to that is then you have potentially a lot more federal senators that are super well maybe maybe so maybe not I mean because the thing is you know there are plenty of conservative enclaves in this in this state and so maybe you put some of those aside don't gerrymander it so that the liberals get everything but the thing is big is generally bad big generally doesn't work one of the wonderful things about the federal process is it lets people test test out different ways of being sure the the part of the state with LA and it is gonna be more liberal than other parts but let it let it happen and see what goes on because I think that when you look at Texas how well that's run under a Republican rule endless Republican rule and then you look at California and how bad it is if Silicon Valley weren't here this place would be going interesting Derek says Andrew what do you think about getting an English degree well leftist professors grade me poorly on purpose that's that is what I've heard and I think you know a lot of the Liberal Arts degrees have been destroyed by leftist in other words it said when I I was an English major I wish I'd been a history major but that was an English major what do you learned as an English major is he came in and you started with Beowulf and by the time you were finished you had read the moderns and you really knew the history of English literature I remember walking down the street one day when I suddenly realized that history had a path the things that happened over time and that Shakespeare had read Virgil and you know Dickens had read Shakespeare and they were all affecting one another and so you did learn something when I talk to English majors today they've never read Shakespeare if you've never read Shakespeare you are not an English major you don't know anything about the English language you don't know any better the formation of your own mind you don't that effective so I doubt it would be effective Ross either that seems more timely than my method would just be fruitful and multiply I think that's the best thing if liberals are only having like 1.2 children I know between the Shapiro's and our family if we can have like 20 that's it I mean looky there I think I think that works the Muslims do this it should work for us all right well says I was watching Tucker Carlson interview where he was interviewing an illegal immigrant business owner how can he legally own a business and why don't we deport him as he admitted to being an illegal well this is you know this is a serious problem I do not want to hurt I understand that some people are having a hard time they want to come here I want people to come here I think you're refreshing the problem is not with any individual illegal person that is not fair that's not where to look at the problem the problem it was with a feckless Congress that does not fix the laws and they and they do it I mean you saw Chuck Schumer the other day waving his pen around saying you know Donald Trump's you just sign an order and fix everything no you guys sit down compromise make laws risk being voted out of office and do what it needs what needs to be done to fix our immigration system so we can get the people we need but also keep out people who we don't want it seems like you know you can't get a hundred percent of what you want we understand this divided government it's supposed to be a divided government but do something these guys are just cowards they are it is feckless cowardice and we shouldn't we shouldn't be blaming the guy who came over to get a better life we should be blaming Congress and that you know who will not pass laws it can be reasonably enforced all right Veronica says Oh bold and handsome why I love Veronica my mom wants to know how old you were when your voice started to sound like that it's just lovely I love this person you know it's funny I have three brothers and my father and my son we all have the exact same voice in fact you can hear messages on our tape machines and I just I noticed on my father he's gone but but you know the my brothers all sound the same we all have big radio voices and my voice started to change when I was about 13 but my mother always told me that I would when I was little you know a little kids ride around in the Pushcart that I would say that would look at the cereal and say things like I would like one of those everybody would stop and look around I guess it was early you always sounded very masculine deep Philip says I really like this girl but she likes guys like you and idolizes you what can I do to win well first of all you've made a good choice this is a woman with excellent excellent taste and I think you just have to become a witty elegant intelligent well learned person and then she'll forget all about who has books turned into movies can you do that yeah absolutely good luck with that Jonathan says hi Andrew in an article by Ryan Saavedra he shares some information from Fox News indicating that the economy has been improving since 2011 how can Trump be credited with the current economic status well here's the thing when the economy crashes like it did in 2008 a major major crash it has a natural tendency to rebound very quickly very in a very big way Obama did everything he could to sit on that rebound only because he doesn't know anything because he thinks he knows stuff and he doesn't and so the economy did rebound but it rebounded at this 1% growth is kind of steady slow thing and all Trump did all he did was put a little bit of animal spirits into the business community by saying things are going to go great and I'm gonna back you pulling out regulations and cutting taxes and he's the more he does that the more the economy will rebound we are really having the rebound we would have had under Obama if he hadn't done all that leftist nonsense in the health care bill that kept it slow so in other words when people say oh well the economy was coming back under Obama I agree the economy would have come back and the American common economy is so resilient it would have come back if you just put a gigantic rock on over we did Obama was that giant rock but I think it still was vibrant enough to come back all Trump has done really is get the government out of the way I would also add I think it's an interesting case study too under the Obama and the Trump years to look at states with Republican legislators legislatures and governors yeah as well because even under Obama you still saw Republican states like Florida and Texas that were thriving despite all the regulations exact well that is the great thing about the federal thought you know the federal system is you can come yet compete like that Phillips says what did you think of Sasha Baer Cowen's latest show that mocks Republicans in the NRA well I'm glad you asked this question because I hate this guy and I think he's talented I think he's funny I think he stinks I think you take you know the thing is this is what I call the tyranny of cool if somebody is cool and Cohen is cool he's outrageous and he's funny and he's all those things and all the right friends right absolutely you start to think well there must be something good about him but that's not true people can be cool and really be jerks and he it is a jerky stinky thing to do to go to ordinary people with the power of a Hollywood film book behind you and make fun of them and he always makes fun of ordinary people in the what they call flyover country in the middle of the country he makes fun of conservatives he makes fun of people with values who want to you know have manners and things like that that makes him even worse but that's not what I dislike but I just like to see fools people who were better men than he is he'll fool cops or full firemen you know fool people who serve their country and I think it's funny and it's witty and its original and it's stinks and I don't see why we can't say those things altogether a person could be town it's like mmm I used to listen to Eminem and think yeah he's talented what he's saying is disgusting you know it does not having talent I'm not trying to be prissy or you know I I'm happy to see outrageous stuff but just because you're doing outrageous stuff that's mean you're not doing a bad thing remember the people that he's making fun of our real people if you even if he was making fun of them in fictional work I would say that would be fine I might not like his opinions but that would be fine but the fact that he uses and abuses real people I just think is wrong interesting Jeremiah says king of the multiverse Clavin you rag on the administrative state slash deep state slash EPA constantly did this soap box arise from personal experience or just reading and observing from observing and from reading and from principle I mean the funny thing is the funny thing is people like us don't get affected by the deep state or the administrative state because the First Amendment protects us so the First Amendment sent essentially says you can't make regulations against speech you can't do it so they go well whatever will will change that they tried they tried to change it every Democrat has tried to change it but they can't because the First Amendment is so ingrained in American culture they want to but they can't but if you have a different kind of business say you may car engines or say you make you know plows or whatever you make you know say you have you you have a restaurant they just go nuts and they come in and tell you how far off the floor your windows have to be and how you know this has to happen look everything we do is regulate it I mean you and I can get in an argument but I can't hit you you know you you know then we have a regulation against that that's fine yes you can hit I kind of enjoy it sick but there I am but but no you know everything is regulated so we need simple straightforward regulations keep your food clean keep your restaurant clean and all this stuff but these guys come to work every day and write more and more regulations each one of those has a cost on a guy's business and each one of them takes his choices and his ideas about how to run a business takes it away some of the stuff we see where lemonade stands are being shut down because they don't have permits that's the deep state and that I just find that incredibly offensive unconstitutional and on American so let me ask you a question that Michael and I asked on Friday live a couple weeks ago because the purge came out yeah so if if there were no laws for 12 hours what would you do I think I do might rebuild my house and play cut down a couple of trees I would go to the IRS in the state of California take back every penny I'd ever paid in tax dollars and use that money to remodel my the other thing I would do is blow up the EPA and then salt the ground where Kate says dear mr. clay Clavin I really enjoyed your audible novel from 2008 recently do you think you inherited your dad's talent from voices oh I wish I had but I really did not my father was one of the great voice men of his era I mean there's that guy's name escapes me but that guy who does a boo in the Simpsons oh yeah he is one of the great he's bubbly Hank Azaria I think he's probably the great one now my father was one of the great ones of his generation I you know he could do any accent he could do a double-talk in Italian to a real Italian and for about two minutes the Italian would think he was speaking Italian before he started to catch on but it was all double-talk that's how good he was I have a certain amount of skill with my voice I have a certain amount of reading skill I can do a range voices but he could just do about anything with his voice it was really quite amazing and my older brother got it but I didn't interesting joel jay says old man Clavin what are your thoughts on video games anime and the international content like Bollywood can we express conservative themes in these alt mediums and he wants to get I love bill Bill's welcome on my show anytime I love video games I play video games all the time I yeah yeah no I do I don't have a lot of time for it so what happens to me sometimes as I lose the Train of the plot because I don't get to play as up as much as I want but but I love video games and I think that they are really the repository of visual arts I think I'd much rather see the art in a video game than go to a museum and watch like Jackson Pollock baloney you know splatters on a wall I think that's great and and sure you can get any kind of values into your content if you just make them if you just make them out of your heart and out of yourself and you have those values those values will come across I'm less aware of anime like I know it what it is and I've seen it but I I don't really know that much about it but all these things are vehicles for communication almost any craft that involves the human person can be turned into an art like in other words I don't believe that an Indian rug can be an art I can believe can be beautiful crafts but it's just shapes and I that's not art to me I agree this is one of the very few things I agree with an R and about that art is about human beings and so anything that really deals with human beings in an honest way can be elevated to the level of art including graphic novels and anime and the rest interesting Philip says do you think that Belmar gave Ben Shapiro a fair shot on his show yes I did and I thought like you know I thought Ben did a great job you know when I want you know it's funny when you watch your friends do this you're always thinking you know oh why didn't he say that and why did he say but then you remember he's the man in the arena and Ben went into this arena where a completely hostile audience a completely hostile guy talking to him and that section where been schooled him on what Trump is done in Russia was fantastic and I even thought I even liked the thing where Maher was talking about civility I feel more strongly that the left has been in uncivil to us for 50 years every time you call somebody racist you're insulting them and that's all they ever do but I thought been handles themselves extremely well and extremely calmly in a very very difficult to arena it's only like I said you could always pick apart things especially when your pals do them you know it gets easy but I thought he walked into a very difficult arena did great not many people could do that no or would know NAT says hey Andrew I found it easy to talk about what you know but you sure look like an idiot when you can't counter something from an opposing voice because well you intellectually can so any tips there yeah I mean you've got to read a lot you got it you got to know you know because you they can always get you if you watch leftists argue by the way they keep changing the subject until they find something you don't know about and and one of the things that I like to do when I talk to leftist is just point out what they're doing so for instance one of the things that left this love to do is they like to take your jokes seriously and then hold you to account as if your joke was real so you're left with this kind of weak answer well that was just a joke you know so what I do is I say ah you're using that I will just say to the person I are using that leftist technique of taking my joke seriously but that's really a dishonest thing to do or I'll say well wait you just change the subject hoping you'd get to something that I don't know anything about but let's go back to what we were talking about but you mean in order to argue in order to debate and I'm not a big debater by the way because I rather talk I'd rather hear I like to hear what the other person is saying but but in order to debate and in order to Lake make your case you better know what you're talking about you better have the facts and not just a bunch of kind of ill formed opinions I think that's the key okay Jeremiah Jeremiah Peterson brave guy putting both names up there first and last Lord of the multiverse Clavin I am NOT a naturally disciplined person so how can I work on developing that kind of mindset that you describe a little bit at a time that's what you do I mean everything you do I've done this with just about everything I actually have two tips for this one is do it a little bit of a time and move it move it up so if you want to exercise you know do one pushup then wait a month and do two push-ups and then you know whatever whatever you think you can handle I always try to do a little less than I think I can handle so I don't fall back you know I would rather I would rather only start with five push-ups knowing I can do ten then start with ten and find I could only do eight you know because then you stop yes and the other thing I always do and I'm taking on a new discipline is I try to think about it positively if I'm trying to lose weight I don't think about losing weight that's a negative thing I think about eating healthily and eating well and looking good and feeling good about myself that's that's the kind of attitude I try to have you know if I if I cut down I went through a long process of cutting down on my drinking because I just felt it crap I know I love it so much but it crept up on me and I started think you know what I'm not waking up feeling as good as I should so I cut it down and I would always just concentrate on the fact that if when you don't drink you can stay up later you can read if you wake up in the middle of night you feel fine and you can read and I'm just concentrate on the positive aspects of it so start small you know move up in an orderly but a slow but orderly way and think about it positively okay so please remember that our conversation is live for everyone to watch but you can only be a part of it if you're a subscriber and if you want to do that you should go over to Daley wire comm and click the link in our video description to ask questions or sign up and be sure to tune in for our next episode it's gonna be on Tuesday August 21st at 5:30 p.m. Eastern 2:30 p.m. Pacific and it's gonna feature our very own Michael Knoll so you want to get your answers and now while they're still true yeah or I mean sometimes the questions that come in from Michael I don't know here's a female fan base do you know that these chicks know that that makes sense to me women are very self-destructive sometimes what should one do if you keep falling sorry what should one do if you keep failing at doing what you love well I was like a very micro type question to me you know I think I think you can adjust you know I think that if you keep failing at it there's a reason you keep failing at it there could be all kinds of reasons one you might be doing it wrong one you might not have the skill to do exactly what you what you think you love you know if you like with people if you keep falling in love with people who hurt you you're doing it wrong you know so I think that there are all kinds of reasons but you know what assess them assess it why did you fail why did you fail the last time is it like the same time you failed of time before is there something you keep doing over and over again and I think I think where you can move forward you may not get you know if what you want is a very very specific goal you may not get it I always remember Kirk Douglas one of the famous biggest movie stars of the 50s right he said I wanted to be a theatre actor and I always thought of myself as a failed theater actor and I thought well then you're just thinking wrong man you were one of the biggest movie stars in the world but you didn't get to do exactly what you wanted you modified it and did something else I think that that's a font that's fine you'll be you'll be perfectly happy with that if you keep your attitude positive all right Mike says I'm really interested in how you developed your schedule I'm such a bad procrastinator it really hurts me I tend to come up with so many ideas but never act on them because I never know where to start well that is that is an important thing that you do have to do a thing you know you cannot do a million things you know you just won't do it so you do have to pick something I always feel like I mean I sure a lot of people with my discipline and have this I always feel that there's something else I should be doing while I'm doing it and I exactly exactly you just put it aside and do the thing that you're going to do I'm very big on finishing things I know that there's some things that shouldn't be finished and I abandon them but I'm very big my first instinct is always to finish something and then you know go back and make it better and all this stuff don't try to make it perfect the first time go back and make it better so I mean I just think it's it's just it's discipline you got to start again and with discipline it's the same thing you know Elmore Leonard the great mystery writer used to tell people wake up an hour earlier do an hour of work and then go about the rest of your day do an hour of writing and then do about the rest of your day and he said he always knew and he gave that advice if he was talking to someone who could be a writer because they just said they just nodded and took the advice if they said well you know if I wake up an hour early he said he knew that we're never gonna do it Andrew says hey Andrew have you watched any of the hashtag walkaway videos what do you think about that I've watched a little bit I certainly watch the original one and I've seen a couple like pieces of them and I think I think it's great I mean there is nothing like this on the left there's nobody walking away from the right to become a left winger there just isn't there I mean everything about them is small-minded mean pinched censorious and and and misguided you know so I mean once you see one of the wonderful things about conservatism and my conservatism I mean a freedom that's all I mean I mean just like loving people not just for me to be free but for you to be free for us to be able to disagree for us to not associate or associate all those things that come along with American life with American freedom one of the things about is once you see it you can't unsee it once you see what it means to be free you can't unsee it and once you see how much we've been lied to and how many people want power over your lives and how many people are selling you a vision that life will be better if you just let other people have power over your lives once you see that you can't unsee it and you're free and I think of the walk away movement just like the red pill movement is a great thing okay Jeremy says do you see a gradual thawing of the left and the right post Trump or will things continue to escalate well nobody knows the future I could really see let's take a good scenario there possible good scenario Trump is a divisive figure you know he really does divide people and for and for some very good reasons but he's also doing a good job as president I mean the economy is doing well the judges that he's appointing or good rolling back regulations is a good thing so I could actually see that him serving two terms and then a more moderate not a more moderate conservative a conservative but a more moderate personality taking over and people kind of going like ah enough of the drama enough of the yelling enough of this yeah and yet continuing and those concern in that conservative path I mean I don't know if Mike Pence who I love I don't know if he has what it takes to be to run for be president he's probably still because of because of his religion he's probably still a little bit more divisive it may be that the left hates America so much that no pro-american politician will win their hearts but you don't have to win their hearts you have to win everybody else's hearts like I could really see that happening okay Andrew says hey Andrew in Mona Sharon's latest book sex matters she says that the divide between college-educated women and non educated men is making it more difficult to marry today what can we do to solve this well I think that it really is a problem but I do think that part of it is that college for some men has become useless you know if it's just become a kind of left-wing brainwashing machine why do it so I think that you know women should look maybe women shouldn't think about credentials as much as the person who's there you know what what is he doing with his life whatever his ambitions if you see an ambitious man who has a plan who has skill who's ready to work to hone his skill and ready to work to put his skill into operation maybe you shouldn't worry so much about whether he has a degree as long as you know obviously you might not want to marry an idiot but they may you shouldn't worry so much about his credentials and we're more about who the man is being the devil's advocate here I would think that it's more difficult to be a woman with a degree and get a man without a degree interested in you because sometimes men are intimidated by intimidated by maybe you know III don't know I can see where it's a problem and I also think College is a great place for men and women to meet each other if they if they play their cards right it's a good place like Christian College I mean come on no that is absolutely true so you know I mean I do think that anything that divides us is it divides men and women is a difficulty but I do think also that women have to if it's going to become the only one there's only the G of it back to life because I don't have a lot of time to watch sport so that's my favorite sport right now I also do like baseball I'm kind of excited little bran James has come in to LA that that may bring me back to the LA Lakers who I watched religiously when Shaquille and what's his name Kobe were on the team but I do love sports and he asked what they can teach you I mean I think they teach you a couple of things one is that ex-what excellence looks like and what it takes to be excellent which is really important and the other is that certain things don't yield if the other team has more points than you do they win and talking about it doesn't mean a thing and I think that makes you better to face life that way to know when you've lost no any of one to know that when you want to win you have to be excellent and to know that even when you're excellent you sometimes won't win I think that's a lot of things that sports can deliver that's poker but yeah Diana says when you have to do research for a work of fiction do you do it yourself or have others help and spearhead it for you both i I will do certain things myself but if I have a lot of interviews to do I love having hiring someone who'll go and get me the interviews because it's very hard for me to do it you know other people are better at it than I am there's certain kinds of reading you have to do by yourself certain interviews that you have to do by yourself but if I can get somebody there they're things we're like if I'm gonna write scenes in the past somebody else might say I might say to somebody else go find out what people dressed like what they think just get me a book they'll make you a book people who work in movies do this they'll make you a book that'll just show you what people looked like and thought like I still have to do a lot of reading myself but I love having I love hiring somebody who can set up the interviews for me and find some of the material interesting Philip says how do you win arguments against leftists that ignore facts and go on feelings only you can't you can't I mean it's like it is amazing I especially amazing with guns where you can explain to people why we have the right to bear arms you can explain to people that the more a gun ownership had gone up the more the murder rate has gone down you can explain that we're living in a low-crime era somewhat in part because of guns they don't care those things that you'll bang and they people bleed and they're scary and they just will not listen to you but you can't you can't win an argument with anybody who this believe in facts I mean right or left I mean facts or what arguments are about right I mean you're arguing about the facts and you're arguing about different approaches to the facts it's it's fair to have different approaches to the facts you know but it's not fair to have different facts okay Matthew says it seems many young people don't love America anymore why do you think that is and do you think this is a problem I certainly think it's a problem and the reason I think the left has constructed this they did it on purpose they emptied our schools of civic learning you know why we are the way we are I talked to college because even conservative college kids they don't know why we're the way we are they don't know what people thought about they don't know what the world was like before I just saw that that doofus that woman Alexandria Cortez got kZO Cortez yeah the Socialists you know talking about what they asked her the question like what you know what do you what do you make of the fact that that capitalism has solved the problem of hunger and made us all wealthy well that's just evolution we're just getting to be better people you think like you know that's the vastness of your ignorance you know would be hard to chart the depth of that stupidity that if somebody would say that but that is what they have done they emptied out history they emptied out philosophy they emptied out everything except their own theory whenever you hear that we're teaching feminist theory or race theory oh this theory all that means is leftist propaganda laid over history philosophy and real thought so that you can't see why people did what they did and I think it's been very effective I agree with you hundred percent Phillips says is pornography really that bad or immoral and what's wrong with moderate use well here's the thing about this I I'm not a prig about pornography I've looked at it I'll probably look at it again you know I'm not I'm not a big point algorithm fan but I'm not gonna lie about it you know I think guys like to look at naked women pretty naked women that's what they like they'll do but but look it's addictive I think it's degrading I think it's one of the few things Erica Jong ever said that I agreed with she said when you look at pornography for 10 minutes you want to have sex when you're looking for 20 minutes you never want to have sex ever again and I think that there there is something about that I think it takes you away from reality I think it takes you away from what real women are like and what it means to be with a real woman which is a very much of you know obviously it's a physical experience but it's also a much deeper experience than that and I think it creates a complete false impression of what sex is like in real life the reason I say I'm not a prig about it is I think it can be a harmless vice you know like having like one cigarette a day or something like that you know I think it's a harmless vice but it's still a vice and I still think it's degrading I still think it is a degrading view of human beings and I don't think it's a good thing that that sometimes we all do things that aren't so good I think that's true do you think that your perspective would be different if you didn't have a daughter no I never I always felt this way about pornography I always felt like you know you know when you're a younger person obviously is something you look at more I always felt like you know it's just makes me feel bad about myself at some level that I can't quite figure out what it is no I don't think it required a daughter to make me feel like this you know it's funny I I have not always been as sane a person as I am today I've written about this at length I've not always treated women the way I wish I had treated women but I always liked women I've always gotten along with them ever since I've grown up they've taken care of me in many many ways like lots of women and and I think I've been very grateful to them all my life so I've always felt this way about women I don't want them you know I don't want to abuse them I don't want to hurt them and I don't think I don't think pornography has to be about sadism all the time but I do think it reduces people to shapes instead of humans you know and I mean I know that men are enamored of the female shape but you do want to remember that there's a person inside there absolutely question mr. Kay I have heard you mentioned the zing that pornography creates in your brain as something negative however you also mention the human body particularly the female one is a great impulse for the arts so how and where do you draw the line between porn and eroticism especially for a creator to be well I think you know it's actually that's actually a great question but it's also kind of an easy question our bodies do create these Zing's for various things and one of one of them is when men look at women they get this kind of zing you know that maybe you get this feeling you can feel it but you want to be attaching that to the rest of your humanity your body is only one that you have to experience humanity so for instance if if I want to if I if I want to have a have food you know I want to enjoy that food and I want it to taste good and I want to sit and savor it but I don't want to just sit there and eat and eat and eat until you know until it's meaningless and it makes me sick things have meaning things are not just objects they have meaning you know food has a meaning women and sex and love have meaning and I think what what true erotic art does is it brings you in to the meaning of relationships the meaning of those physical relationships and what pornography does is it severs you from that it severs you it's meaningless and you if you watch pornography you see people doing things and you think like wow I wish life could be that meaningless because there'd be no consequences there'd be no responsibilities there'd be no none of the effort of having human relationships that's not what you want to be thinking what you want to be thinking is I you know this this zing that I feel is part of a complex of relationships that make life worthwhile interesting Richard said does plot fiction I'm sorry just plot in fiction need to be original or have twists is that is that a choice I guess it is a but between I mean original or have twist hey you know no I mean I think interesting you want one of my better books is a book called true crime which I purposely wrote on a corny plot because what I wanted to do is I wanted the plot to a reveal character so I wanted you to underpot right away and not have you know has twists and all that stuff but but I wanted you to understand oh I've seen this plot before and then find yourself swept away in the depth of the characters that were in it was it was just an experiment I did which I thought worked out very well I you know I think that plotting I like plotted stories not everybody does some people can watch a show there's just a kind of vague drama or read a book that just kind of have vague you know character studies and things like that I really like taht original plots and I like the moment that the moment that I love is the moment when you get what the plot is the moment when you say ah Bruce Willis is stuck without shoes and a building that's been taken over by terrorists I get it you know or Hamlet has to you know revenge avenge his father and he's a guy who can't make up as you know though those are things that I happen to just love and plots and so what I like in a plot is is that moment when the character and the problem come together and you think ah you know if that were anybody else this wouldn't be a great story and if that were any other story it wouldn't be a great character but the two of them together really make it work but that's you know there are different kinds of stories Matthew says what is your favorite vacation spot oh gosh I mean I love Rome I love being in Rome and love being in Italy I love the woods so last vacation Nolan and I went up to Oregon and we just hiked around so anytime I'm in the woods I'm happy I never know why that is but there's something I think I like there must be part of me that's like a woodland creature I just get there and I suddenly feel that I'm in the right space I love traveling or when we lived in England we traveled all over the place I loved going to Africa that was a magical trip and and so I really like well I like best is I like a place where I can go and have one day of sitting around and one day of adventure that's you know and then I'll kind of do it back and forth one of the greatest trips we ever took was in Hawaii when every other day we were doing something fantastic which flew helicopters into you know volcanoes and went hiking in the jungle and every other day we just sit around the beach yeah that was great relaxed day and then I adventurer named Dustin says what can a writer specifically gain from reading Dostoyevsky oh gosh dessa ASQ one of the great great novelists and certainly the novels for crime and punishment which has the biggest effect of any novel on my personal life I think his searing honesty and his psychology is his psychology and his searing moral vision I think were just amazing he really what he really was a prophet he was a guy who saw because of what he saw in front of him he saw where the country was going to go and he saw that he saw communism coming he saw you know a moral relativism coming and he addressed it from a profound Christian point of view but not Christian the way we think of Christian of like everything is shiny and good and great but Christian from the idea that the world has a moral web that when you go into it bends and gives but won't break and it's just incredibly incredibly brilliant perception into the human mind and the human heart interesting Jeremy says what made you choose Christianity as opposed to Judaism since you were born Jewish yeah you know I mean it's a it's a great question I believe in Christianity because I believe it's true I mean it's the only reason I would believe in anything I don't believe in it because I think it's good I don't believe in because I think society needs it I believe in it because I think it is the literal truth and that really answers the question right there I don't know what would have happened to me if I'd been raised in a house of true where Judaism was taught in a true dedicated believing manner I was raised in such a way that anybody of integrity would have been estranged from the whatever religion it had been if I had been raised that way as an evangelical I had been estranged from evangelicalism because it was I was raised to follow the patterns of the religion but not to believe in its inner depths so that's you know that was just hypocrisy that's just teaching your kid hypocrisy so I was estranged from it I don't know what would have happened if I'd been raised with integrity and to the Jewish religion maybe it would have satisfied me but I still believe that it's Christianity that is telling the true story fascinating and says I just listened to the podcast that you Ben and Michael did on the Trump Russia meeting you and Michael seemed less harsh than Ben on the event why also why are they calling Trump a traitor they're going from betrayed it because they got big mouths and a panic over everything it's just utterly absurd we did this a little bit with Obama I always felt I felt people were calling Obama traitor and treasonous and I kept saying to him you know the guy's a the guy's a bad president and he and he's an anti-american president but I never thought he was a traitor I'd never used those words I think there were melodramatic words you know Benny's a little harder on Trump than I am and but it's funny but one of the things I've noticed about both about Ben and I over the years is that we see a lot of the same things it's not because sometimes you're talking to people and you don't see the same things at all we know we do and is one of the reasons we have good discussions because we see a lot of the same things but I I'm always concerned about the country and freedom you know in other words Trump will be gone Obama will be gone but freedom still be there will freedom be gone that's what I'm worried about Trump has made us more free by dialing back regulations by putting in judges who believe in the Constitution by helping our economy which I think helps freedom bolsters freedom so he has done things that I think will make America better and more free so when he does the things that both Ben and I say and we both roll our eyes and we both think that was a mistake and we both do I did not I did not cut Trump slack and say oh he he was playing 3d chess ice talked about the mistake he made but I tend to be easier on him because I think things are going well if everything was falling apart then I would be picking him apart because that's what I care about the country I don't really care what happens to this child you know I mean he will come and go but but the question is will our freedom survive so I I think I haven't that that different perspective Ben is in many ways a more political person than I am he's more concerned about what is happening each day and what that means and I'm more like a cultural person who thinks like how are things going you know how are things going on right now I think they're going really well and so if Trump does something that I don't quite like I'm probably going to give him a little bit more slack okay Levi says I was recently dating a girl who you could consider agnostic she claims that she sorry she claims was that I is a devout Christian had convinced myself of my belief or was brainwashed what would you say to this I mean you could say the same thing to her the chief convinced there's of not to believe it I mean that's it's kind of a it's kind of a bum argument because how can you answer that you know it's an accusation it's not really an argument how could you date that yeah you know she's not she's not really arguing in any responsible way you know she's not saying well this is my problem with your philosophy what is your answer to that you can't answer I always tell people not to do this to your opponents because it makes you you ignorant you don't say to someone oh you're just saying that because you're a woman you're just saying that because you're white you're just saying that because you come from this town instead of that time you know that's essentially what she's doing you're saying you're just convinced yourself of that how do you answer that no I didn't you know oh yeah and no I didn't you know you can't really there's no place to get purchased there if what she said says she says you know how can you possibly believe this this or this well then you have to answer that you have to you know you being addressed with respect and you should answer with respect all right Oscar says as a person who has most of his family waiting 30-plus years in Mexico I find it insulting that others can come here illegally and stay do you think this is an issue that will bring Hispanics to the right man I hope so because it's so true I mean it is so true in other words if you are willing to break the law you can beat out the person that we want who is the person from Mexico who follows the law obeys the law it's it's insane you know we want we understand we want people who can assimilate we want people who can become part of America we want people who be proud to be Americans a guy in Mexico who's willing to obey the law and wait it out and get here is probably a person like that where a guy who sneaks across is less likely to be that person I'm not saying none of them would be but he's less likely to be that person because he's already broken our laws and treated us with disrespect it's infuriating and the fact that both Republicans and Democrats have been sitting on this for decades is absurd that was it that was our final moment oh my god we're done oh thanks for being lots of good questions that we rolled through today thank you everyone for your participation and for watching remember just subscribe to daily we're calm now so you can
