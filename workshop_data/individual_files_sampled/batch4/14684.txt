there's a fella in the fashion industry you might know even if you don't follow fashion he is brilliant and oftentimes controversial you'd probably recognize his face if nothing else he's got powder white hair and always wears black sunglasses presumably / to protect him from getting crow's feet because those are so not on trend these days I'm speaking of course of Karl Lagerfeld Legend and the creative genius behind current fashion at two prominent fashion houses Chanel and Fendi the Chanel logo the interlocking C's that you I'm sure are familiar with that was created by Lagerfeld for house of Chanel he's been the subject of numerous documentaries he has been on the cover of magazines he has personally photographed some of the biggest names in the industry he is an absolute icon no one can refute that but for a little bit of background he was born in Hamburg Germany though he's pretty vague about the year that he was born he's not vague however about his opinions he has been an outspoken opponent of Angela Merkel's policies particularly as it relates to the admittance of Muslim migrants to Germany in an interview last November on French television he slammed Angela Merkel saying she had invited the worst enemy of the Jewish people to Germany during the migrant crisis so he's no stranger to controversy and he is definitely not deterred from speaking his mind as an impetus for those controversies one such controversy his feelings on the me2 movement the fashion industry much like the film and television industry has been plagued with sexual misconduct allegations recently one such case is that of Karl Lagerfeld's friend Karl Templar who has been accused of aggressively pulling down a models underwear without asking her Templar responded to the allegations with this statement although physical interaction with models is a necessary aspect of my job as a fashion stylist I've never touched anyone in an inappropriate way nor ever with any sexual intent and that highlights something that I want to point out it does tend to be part of the job not pulling down garments specifically but you're in a dressing room with scads of other naked people or people in very degrees of undress you're nearly stark naked in front of designers and seamstresses constantly but hey at least we are out of the heroin chic phase of fashion back when models looked like a bag of bones so that's good they're eating lettuce now instead of ice cubes but they're also in an industry that literally sexualizes everything its intended purpose is to visually excite and stimulate you into buying something and if you've ever seen any reality show movie or TV show about the fashion industry specifically model culture it's not exactly like peering into a day in the life of a Vacation Bible School teacher one group teaches biblical principles and tells stories from Scripture and the other is basically all about money and selling sex so forgive me if I don't have a ton of sympathy for women complaining over sexual ization in the modeling industry that's like an adult-film start complaining about being cold on set you kind of just have to expect it but Karl Lagerfeld in a recent interview said this pertaining to the Karl Templer scandal if you don't want someone pulling down your panties don't become a model he said and in regard to the movement as a whole he said join a nunnery there will always be a place for you in the convent there recruiting even he goes on to say I read somewhere that now you have to ask models whether they feel comfortable when they are posing that's opening the door to anything from then on as a creator you don't do anything anymore now sign note is being comfortable when posing as a model even a reasonable expectation it's hardly ever a natural pose it's like sucking in hair and poking the hip out making the shoulders / - / Trude and all sorts of uncomfortableness is that a word in fact female celebrities literally have to practice their pose for the red carpet in order to accentuate their best parts I should have done that I've seen some pretty unflattering pictures of myself from back in the day when I was in the music industry but what do you guys think do you was Karl Lagerfeld saying what a lot of you are thinking or was it utterly insensitive and how you'd let us know in the comments thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.fafsa.ed.gov
