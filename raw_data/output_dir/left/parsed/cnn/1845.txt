what did you just go through back there
hell how much water is in your house you
can see just people are relieved to at
least be too dry water you can imagine
just what they've gone through over the
past 12 hours okay all right we got you
don't worry don't worry we got you we
got you don't worry
there's been no cell service since
Thursday Friday haven't gotten ahold of
anybody okay the Omni Royal Court
okay dad I love you it was over five
feet in our house we barely made it out
I'm just so grateful that they came
it hurts because you see people work
their lives to build something in any
one night it's all gone
for me most of it is gone I'll build
back I've got a strong working parents
that made me believe hard work to get
you back I'll get going it it's just
hard to see everything it's gone
everything's gone we're gonna try to see
what we can salvage from the wreck
