>> Shepard: AND BREAKING THIS
AFTERNOON, THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT HAS NOW CHARGED A
RUSSIAN WOMAN FOR CONSPIRACY TO
INTERFERE WITH NEXT MONTH'S
MID-TERM ELECTIONS.
IT'S THE FIRST CRIMINAL CASE
AGAINST A FOREIGN NATIONAL
RELATED TO THE COMING MID-TERMS.
HER NAME IS ELAINE HUSOVIA.
SHE WORKED ON A PROJECT THAT
PROSECUTORS SAY WAS DESIGNED TO
CREATE DIVISION IN AMERICA'S
POLITICAL SYSTEM.
BY PLANTING MISINFORMATION
ONLINE, ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM
IMMIGRATION TO GUN CONTROL.
IN THE WORDS OF THE FBI
DIRECTOR, CHRIS WRAY, THIS IS A
STARK REMINDER TO ALL AMERICANS,
OUR FOREIGN ADVERSARIES CONTINUE
TO INTERFERE IN OUR DEMOCRACY BY
CREATING SPECIAL AND POLITICAL
DIVISION, SPREADING DISTRUST IN
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM AND
ADVOCATING FOR THE SUPPORT OR
DEFEAT OF MORE POLITICAL
CANDIDATES.
SO THIS AFTERNOON, AN ACCUSATION
THAT RUSSIA IS UP TO ITS OLD
TRICKS.
THE CHIEF INTELLIGENCE
CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE
ON FOX'S TOP STORY LIVE ON
CAPITOL HILL.
CATHERINE?
>> SHEP, THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT
WAS UNSEALED A HALF HOUR AGAINST
IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF
VIRGINIA.
THERE'S THESE LARGE SERVER FARMS
IN VIRGINIA AND THIS IS WHERE
THE FOREIGN INTERFERENCE, IF YOU
WILL, TOUCHES DOWN INSIDE THE
UNITED STATES.
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT
THAT VIRGINIA JURISDICTION.
THE 44-YEAR-OLD IS A CITIZEN OF
RUSSIA, LIVES IN ST. PETERSBURG
AND ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED IN
PROJECT LOKVA.
THIS COULD BE AN AREA AROUND
ST. PETERSBURG.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, SHE'S
CONNECTED TO A FIRM CALLED
"CONCORD."
THAT FIRM WAS INITIALLY INDICTED
BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND
THE FBI AS INTERFERING IN THE
2016 ELECTIONS.
SO ON ITS FACE, IT DOES SEEM TO
BE AN EXTENSION OF THAT
INTERFERENCE.
I'D ALSO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO
THE DATES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN
THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT.
JANUARY 2016 THROUGH JUNE OF
2018.
AS YOU MENTIONED, SPECIFICALLY
TARGETING THE MID-TERM
ELECTIONS.
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT SAYS THAT SHE
HAD A BUDGET OF $45 MILLION FOR
THE INTERFERENCE PROJECT.
THOUGH IT SAYS THAT A FRACTION
OF THAT MONEY WAS DIRECTED AT
THE UNITED STATES.
IN ADDITION, IT SAYS THAT THEIR
GOAL WAS TO SOW DISSENSION AMONG
AMERICAN CITIZENS AND TO AMPLIFY
DIVISIONS.
THEY DID THIS TRYING TO SHIELD
THEIR IDENTITIES AS RUSSIAN
NATIONALS.
THEY USED VPN OR VIRTUAL PRIVATE
NETWORKS TO SHIELD WHO THEY WERE
AS THEY SET UP E-MAIL AND SOCIAL
MEDIA ACCOUNTS.
I WOULD ALSO ADD THE TIME AGO
PEERS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE JUST A
COUPLE HOURS AGO, WE HAD A
STATEMENT FROM THE DIRECTOR OF
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE THAT
OVERSEES THE 16 INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES, THE HEAD OF THE FBI,
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND
HOMELAND SECURITY EXPRESSING
WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT
INTERFERENCE IN THE UPCOMING
MID-TERM ELECTIONS.
