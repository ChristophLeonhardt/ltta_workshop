Seve see contributor chuck rosenberg is a former US attorney and a former senior FBI official mr. Rosenberg good to see you nice to see you so I'll be honest over the last 25 years I've probably read stories that said so-and-so is the subject of an investigation so-and-so is the target and investigation and I like most of Americans probably thought there's not that I never thought there was that much difference between subject and target I know there is some difference but I never took subject to be A+ in all my years as a federal prosecutor Chuck I've never told a defense attorney that his or her client was a subject and had them thank me for the good news it's not a good thing you don't want to wake up next morning and be a subject of a federal grand jury investigation so under your best abilities that you can why do you think they're trying to spin this as a wind what's the best-case scenario from the point of view of Sekulow and this I can think of an analogy right so perhaps a wildfire that consumes a thousand acres is better than a wildfire that consumes a hundred thousand acres but you're not going to celebrate it I mean I guess relatively speaking being a subject is better than being a target but it's still pretty awful it means that your conduct is under investigation by a federal grand jury is he a subject because they don't have enough evidence or is it possible he's a subject because Bob Muller has read the memo that the Office of Legal kinda the the I believe the Office of Legal Counsel LLC memo from 2000 that said a sitting president can't be criminally indicted right those are two plausible reasons I have a third so to go through your reasons okay first perhaps they still feel that they don't have enough yet they're continuing their investigation and they have not arrived at that conclusion second if they've decided that they cannot charge him based on prior Department of Justice guidance then he could never be a target because he could never be a defendant but also third plausibly chuck they're doing what a lot of good prosecutors do they're being cautious you're not going to indict a president or label him as a target unless you're positive and if the investigation is ongoing they may not yet be positive okay so there was some speculation in here that said Mahler and that it was in the post reporting it's eluded that John Dow the former lead attorney for the President may have quit over this they say may it's not it's alluded to but that this idea that somehow be careful it's a trap you could go from a subject to a target he's telling you this in order to lure you into the interview not a chance good prosecutors don't play games good prosecutors care deeply about their reputation not just in front of the court but also with the defense bar and so they tell the truth prosecutors in my experience are truth tellers and so by the way even if they were lying no good defense attorney would walk their client the president or anyone else for that matter into a grand jury unless the defense attorneys were also convinced that they had a plausible tale to tell so a they don't lie and be nobody would fall for it it makes no sense that this is a trap or a ruse in this story it also indicated that Muller plans to do multiple reports send him to Rosenstein and then it'll be up to him at some point he doesn't have to report this out to Congress is the most likely scenario here that in Italy as we've discussed this before and I don't want to go deep into every aspect of the Muller probe but that Muller will probably write an obstruction report first because that's the easiest one to do what's there what's not and that Rosen Stein waits for all the reports before he sends them to Congress or would he piecemeal it I think likely if this is the path that we end up traveling multiple reports and this is according the Washington Post and we don't know for sure that Muller is doing in other words we have to conclude that the president's not a target that they can't charge of all of those things have to sort of fall away if we're left in report land then I imagined that Rosenstein aggregates multiple reports and sends them over to the Congress at once I want to ask you about where we are in this investigation because it was in the Atlantic earlier this week noting we've learned a lot about different pieces of Muller's investigation he's clearly got an obstruction of justice probe he had the indictments on there Russians for doing the fake news in the bots but there has been one giant gaping hole in the investigation where we have not had a inkling of where Muller's headed literally until the last two days when it comes to Roger stone and that is the one crime we all know was committed this the the theft of those emails from the DNC server right so that personal I think that's an excellent point second that touches on a larger counterintelligence investigation so the obstruction piece for instance is discrete and finite there are a limited number of great doesn't mean secretive in this case discreet means it's just a limited scope of what you need to do sorry I did some people will hear discrete that they go it's a secret it's not a suit yes but it's finite right and and thank you for clarifying and you know but the other part of it the theft of the emails right the interference the in the election that is layered and complex and nuanced when I was aligned federal prosecutor I handled espionage cases in order to bring those charges not only do you have to assemble the facts but you have to make sure that what you're going to put in the public domain is okay with the rest of the intelligence community yeah there's a lot of basically counterintelligence and secret intelligence will we ever see it or is it possible we could never have it go public because it would give away to the Russians for instance how we found out it's possible that you would never see it it's also possible that prosecutors if they believe a crime has been committed will find a way to charge it but that's what makes it so much more complex and that's why you don't see it yet well I have to tell you I don't know whether it's secret or not but publicly if you've you can't this would be a tricky political environment to charge somebody with a crime and say but we can't show you the hell no no no Doug Bob okay actually explain it a little bit better all right if they were to charge somebody with a crime then all of what they've charged and the evidence they would need to adduce to prove it would be public so it would be public in that sense if they decide not to charge someone with a crime you might not see it all right Chuck Rosenberg that's always it's good to have your expertise hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC
