1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,100
I'll play it again.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,140
It's a sound effect called an

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,040
orchestra hit.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,060
Bruno Mars, he's the king
of nostalgia and he used that effect in

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,180
"Finesse" to take you back to the 80's.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,939
Take a listen to any pop, dance, or hip hop

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,360
song in the 80's or 90's and you're gonna
hear a version of it.

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,720
There are all types of orchestral hits.

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,060
But the original one, this one here.

10
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,000
Isn't from a few decades ago. In fact it was

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,680
first played in 1910 at the Paris Opera.

12
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,500
We can thankfully hear

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,420
the greatest

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,820
composer of our time, Stravinsky, performing
his own works.

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,650
Telling us all those

16
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,900
subtleties of his musical wishes and
intentions, which could never be fully

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,440
documented in the cold black print of a
score.

18
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,280
This is the famed 20th century Russian
composer Igor Stravinsky. He's about 80

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,520
years old here, but when he first
composed the Firebird Suite he was...

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,680
28 years old. Holy sh*t.

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,180
And during his adult life the

22
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,040
world changed dramatically, two or three
times.

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,069
That's Robert Fink, he wrote a

24
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,840
history of that sound you just heard.

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,179
Firebird is his first major successful

26
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:07,200
piece it made his reputation. Everybody
loved the Firebird. Stravinsky is like

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,450
one of those rock stars who has one huge
hit early on in their career and then

28
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,319
they have to play that song every
concert for the rest of their lives.

29
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,819
He adjusted the score a bit over the
years but the jarring opener of one of

30
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,099
the last scenes in the ballet remained
one of Firebird's most dramatic moments.

31
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,069
Right, because what it is is it's
basically a gesture for the orchestra.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
It shocks the hell out of you, in
the context of the original piece.

33
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,800
So how

34
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,310
did that --

35
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,329
become so ubiquitous that in
1992, NWA said this about it on

36
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,060
Straight Out of Compton?

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,060
To figure that
out you have to go to Australia.

38
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,260
I'm Peter Vogel, I developed the first
commercial sampling synthesizer which

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,060
was the Fairlight CMI back in about 1975.

40
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,989
The other person who was involved was

41
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,040
Kim Ryrie.

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,640
This is the Fairlight CMI. To put it

43
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,389
simply it's one of the most influential
musical innovations of the past 100

44
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:15,889
years. It was one of the very first
digital synthesizers, a digital audio

45
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,980
workstation, and the first digital sampler
all in one.

46
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,620
With the aid of computers, you

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,790
could create the music that you had in
your head a lot more easily than if you

48
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,340
had to sit down and learn to play
instruments from scratch.

49
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,409
It was really a

50
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:31,580
lazy shortcut.

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,200
You got to see this
unbelievable machine, I don't even know if we can

52
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:35,900
get a camera back here?

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,320
Or do we have a camera?

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,840
Oh he's back here already. Forgive me.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,460
This is showing one of the sounds, what the pattern looks like.

56
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,209
Do me a favor: punch up let's see how the

57
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,220
sales are in Omaha.

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
The two major things
that it introduced to music production

59
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:52,140
were visual sequencing and digital
sampling.

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,180
It was the first instrument

61
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,780
that had a screen based sequencer, that
allowed you to actually compose complex

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,160
pieces of music, have the machine play it
for you.

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,120
It was called Page R.

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,900
Here's Herbie Hancock demonstrating it
for Quincy Jones.

65
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,079
And there's two ways to do it:

66
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,540
you can either write it on the screen
or you can play it on a keyboard. Oh okay.

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,200
See, now if you write it on a screen...

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,140
This is a tool that anyone

69
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:26,000
today can take advantage of. Hell, I can
sequence a drum pattern on my iPhone.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,320
In the early 80's sequencing like this was a
revelation.

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,440
There is a way in which the

72
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,260
Fairlight's interface is incredibly far
ahead of its time.

73
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,699
I mean it's like a

74
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,139
Star Trek thing, right? You're using a
light pen to write on a cathode ray tube.

75
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,900
Do something with a light pen.

76
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,949
Well the world is going crazy ladies and gentlemen.

77
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,070
Many of the musicians who used
it sort of became the Fairlight's

78
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,660
ambassador.

79
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,620
Stevie Wonder was the first
person I delivered one to in the United States

80
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,280
and then people in the studio
would gather around and they said hey I

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,440
know someone would be really interested
to see this.

82
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,620
Next thing you know he's in London setting one up
for Peter Gabriel.

83
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,860
He introduced me to

84
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,460
Kate Bush, there were some guys from Led
Zeppelin there.

85
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,560
What really made the

86
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,740
Fairlight a game-changer, though, was the
digital sampler.

87
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,860
You could hook up a

88
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,450
microphone to the Fairlight, record any
second of sound, and then play it at any

89
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,820
pitch on the keyboard.

90
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,160
The Fairlight also
came with a stock library of sounds too,

91
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,980
on giant 8-inch floppy disks.

92
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,140
So we started off with maybe one floppy disk

93
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,200
with 50 different sounds on it.

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,640
People who were using it would send us back

95
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,540
floppies and say hey look at these
samples I've created.

96
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,800
While working

97
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,670
on the basic song ideas, Gabriel was also
compiling a library of sounds which he

98
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,980
might use on the album.

99
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,380
For this he used
a computerized instrument called a Fairlight.

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,360
Peter Gabriel actually broke the glass
and Kate Bush used it in her music.

101
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,100
There were baby screeches, smashes, drips,
and rotary dials.

102
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,720
And then there was the

103
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,834
orchestra hit.

104
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,830
Ironically the the orchestra hit was a

105
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,810
complete accident which was sampled by
me.

106
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,340
I just happened to have a vinyl
recording of the Stravinsky Firebird Suite

107
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,380
nearby when I was messing around.

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,600
That Orchestra hit, which I think was

109
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,340
right at the beginning of one of the
tracks.

110
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,740
And I thought alright it's a good sound.

111
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,300
Peter called the sound orch2 and put it on an
eight inch floppy disk full of those

112
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,160
other stock sounds.

113
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,980
Planet Rock

114
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,040
was the first smash hit record to use orch2. In the first two seconds of the song

115
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,320
it's used five times.

116
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,540
So the thing that
you can know immediately about Planet Rock

117
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,320
is that 50,000 people copied it.

118
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,220
That 8-bit Orchestra hit started popping

119
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,320
up in all sorts of songs.

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,080
Within a few years of the Fairlight
being around, all sorts of synths and

121
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,830
samplers came with a stock variation of
the orch2 hit. And they got crisper and

122
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,500
cleaner with new technology.

123
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,479
You can hear that transformation in the

124
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,260
hit Swedish producer Max Martin made
with Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,900
But that original orch2 sample, it
remains the most iconic. And it's

126
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,400
probably why Bruno Mars used it,

127
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,800
or at least a very close simulation of it, in Finesse.

128
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,600
When you hear that orchestra hit,
you're hearing something which is very

129
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,980
much about the middle 1980's. It's
actually something that was first

130
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,280
thought of by a guy in 1909.

131
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,700
It's like a moment where a whole bunch of times are

132
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,860
sewn together.

133
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,280
It is kind of timeless.

134
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,860
That is the actual piece of vinyl that

135
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,780
orch2 was sampled off.

136
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,210
So you can tell it was a long time ago when you paid, $6.99

137
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:09,820
for a record.

138
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,000
So there are three links
that are in the description below, one to

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,588
Robert Fink's paper,

140
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:20,040
another to a Fairlight CMI iPhone app which Peter Vogel
helped create,

141
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,780
Last but not least I made

142
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,000
an orchestra hit playlist on Spotify.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enjoy it.
