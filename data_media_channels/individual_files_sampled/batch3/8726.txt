Laura: TIME FOR OUR SEEN AND UNSEEN SEGMENT. WE EXPOSE WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE BIG CULTURAL STORIES OF THE DAY. ROSEANNE MAY BE GETTING LESS POLITICAL AND IS REBOOTED MURPHY BROWN ABOUT TO TAKE ON FOX NEWS. WE TURN TO RAYMOND ARROYO? THEY SAID ROSEANNE IS BEING TO BACK AWAY FROM POLITICS AND FOCUS ON THE FAMILY THIS SEASON. TODAY ROSEANNE TWEETED OUT. THE PRESS MISREPRESENTED WHAT THE ABC PRESIDENT SAID. SHE WILL KEEP ON THIS TRAIN WITH A BALANCE BETWEEN POLITICS AND FAMILY. IT'S THE STORY OF THE FAMILY THAT KEEPS THE FAMILY WATCHING. Laura: TO KEEP BREATHING YOU HAVE TO HAVE POLITICS BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY. MURPHY BROWN. LET'S WATCH. YOU COULD NOT TELL THE EVENING NEWS FROM AN EPISODE OF ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT. THE PROBLEM WAS I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF. AND THEN, WE HAD AN ELECTION. Laura: I THOUGHT THAT WAS BETTY WHITE. OH MY GOSH! SHE MOVED INTO THE TAPIOCA SET. Laura: HE LOOKS GREAT. WELL, HER VOICE IS VERY HUSKY. SHE'LL BE A HOST LIKE MORNING JOE. OPPOSITE HER SON WHO IS ON A FOX AND FRIENDS TYPE SHOW. Laura: THEN THERE IS A LONG CAREER FOR ME. THE CBS CHIEF SAID WE WON'T GET ROSEANNE STYLE RATINGS. I THINK HE IS RIGHT. Laura: IT WON'T LAST A SEASON Laura: IT WON'T LAST A SEAS N SEASON. YOU ARE NOT A BIG FAN OF REBOOT? I AM NOT. BUT THIS IS ON youTUBE RED AND IT'S THIS. I HEARD YOU BEAT UP TEENAGERS. I DIDN'T BEAT UP TEENAGERS. I KICKED THE OUT OF PEOPLE WHO DESERVED IT. THIS IS THE KAWARTHA KARATE KID REBOOT. 51 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THIS. THE BIGGEST STREAMING SHOW IN ALL OF TELEVISION. HUGE AUDIENCES. WHY IS THIS WORK SOMETHING Laura: THE '80s ARE MAKING A BIG COMEBACK. IT'S NOSTALGIA FOR PEOPLE OUR AGE. Laura: GREAT HAIR BANDS AND REAGAN FOR 8 YEARS. WAS ASOME! IT WAS AWESOME. THEY ARE KILLING THE COMPETITION AND JUST RENEWED. Laura: MY FAVORITE PART WAS SWEEP THE KNEE, NOT THE LEGS. THEN THE BEST ONE WAS WHEN HE FIRST LEARNED KARATE AND LOOKS DOWN AT THE GROUND. EYES! THAT'S WHAT YOU DO ON THE "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE" SHOW? Laura: YES, IF THEY DON'T LOOK AT US. AND ONE OF THE GREATEST WRITERS, A BOOK AWARD WINNER. THE INTELLECTUALS IN NEW YORK, THEY THOUGHT I MUST BE LIKE THEM WHEN IT CAME TO POLITICS. I WENT INTO A ROOM FULL OF JOURNALISTS OR WRITERS IN GENERAL, PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT ME AS IF I JUST RAISED MY HAND AND SAID BY THE WAY, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, I AM A CHILD MOLESTER. Laura: HE WAS SO GREAT. THE WORD RIGHT STUFF, LIMITING LIBERALS, GOOD OLD BOY. ALL OF THOSE TERMS CAME FROM TOM. A GREAT NOVELIST. Laura: ONE OF THE BEST INTERVIEWS I DID ON RADIO WAS WITH TOM? UNTIL I WAS ON THE SHOW NOW. Laura: EXACTLY. ARE YOU GETTING READY FOR THE ROYAL WEDDING? Laura: YES. I AM PREPARING TOO. ARE YOU READY? I DON'T CARE WHO TAKES HER DOWN THE AISLE.
