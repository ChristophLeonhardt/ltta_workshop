This is Gus Van Sant.
I’m the director
of “Don’t Worry,
He Won’t Get Far on Foot."
This is our character
John Callahan
played by Joaquin Phoenix.
In the story, he’s had
a catastrophic accident,
and now he’s given an
electric wheelchair.
So now, this is the cure-all
to his motion problems.
I think in the screenplay
there was suggestion
that there would be,
like, a series of shots
that were related to his first
time working a wheelchair.
On the set, the
day we shot it,
we had gotten into the habit
of very loosely interpreting
the script.
I think it was more
we had a long lens,
we had the shots
in our head, we
had by then decided to use the
zoom lens a lot in the film.
So we were like zooming
in, zooming into wheels,
zooming into the joystick,
zooming into his face,
zooming out again.
But a lot of
what’s going on is
Joaquin, himself, wanted
to act as if he’d never
used the wheelchair before.
So he was doing a lot of the
revalatory parts himself,
and we were basically
just capturing it.
We had a number of
different things
that we could do
with the wheelchair.
We could put the camera
on the wheelchair,
and we had a kind
of rickshaw as well.
And we had a skateboard
and we had a slider
and we had a spinner that
could spin the camera around.
And it was in a wheel that
could make it go in a circle
on the axis of its lens,
so that it was sort
of spinning on that axis.
The revelation of a thing
that can actually take you out
of your confinement in the way
that it does with motorized
wheels was a big moment.
