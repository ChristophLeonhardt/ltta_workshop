>> Announcer: NOW REPORTING 
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> GOOD MORNING.
WE WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE 
SENATE FLOOR.
AL FRANKEN RESPONDING TO CALLS 
ASKING FOR HIS RESIGNATION. 
>> I FELT WE HAD ENTERED AN 
IMPORTANT MOMENT IN THE HISTORY 
OF THIS COUNTRY.
WE WERE FINALLY BEGINNING TO 
LISTEN TO WOMEN ABOUT THE WAYS 
IN WHICH MEN'S ACTIONS AFFECT 
THEM.
THE MOMENT WAS LONG OVERDUE.
I WAS EXCITED FOR THAT 
CONVERSATION AND HOPEFUL THAT IT
WOULD RESULT IN REAL CHANGE THAT
MADE LIFE BETTER FOR WOMEN ALL 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN EVERY 
PART OF OUR SOCIETY.
THEN THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO 
ME.
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS A NUMBER
OF WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD TO 
TALK ABOUT HOW THEY FELT MY 
ACTIONS HAD AFFECTED THEM.
I WAS -- I WAS SHOCKED.
I WAS UPSET.
IN RESPONDING TO THEIR CLAIMS I 
ALSO WANTED TO BE RESPECTFUL OF 
THAT BROADER CONVERSATION 
BECAUSE ALL WOMEN DESERVE TO BE 
HEARD AND THEIR EXPERIENCES 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.
I THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.
I ALSO THINK IT GAVE SOME PEOPLE
THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS 
ADMITTING TO DOING THINGS THAT 
IN FACT I HAVEN'T DONE.
SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 
ME ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE.
OTHERS I REMEMBER VERY 
DIFFERENTLY.
I SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT THE 
ETHICS COMMITTEE WAS THE RIGHT 
VENUE FOR THESE ALLEGATIONS TO 
BE HEARD AND INVESTIGATED AND 
EVALUATED ON THEIR MERITS, THAT 
I WAS PREPARED TO COOPERATE 
FULLY AND THAT I WAS CONFIDENT 
IN THE OUTCOME.
YOU KNOW, AN IMPORTANT PART OF 
THE CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN 
HAVING THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAS 
BEEN OUT HOW MEN ABUSE THEIR 
POWER AND PRIVILEGE TO HURT 
WOMEN.
I AM PROUD THAT DURING MY TIME 
IN THE SENATE I HAVE USED MY 
POWER TO BE A CHAMPION OF WOMEN 
AND THAT I HAVE EARNED A 
REPUTATION AS SOMEONE WHO 
RESPECTS THE WOMEN I WORK 
ALONGSIDE EVERY DAY.
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A VERY 
DIFFERENT PICTURE OF ME PAINTED 
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, BUT I 
KNOW WHO I REALLY AM.
SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE HAS BEEN THE GREAT HONOR 
OF MY LIFE.
I KNOW IN MY HEART THAT NOTHING 
I HAVE DONE AS A SENATOR, 
NOTHING, HAS BROUGHT DISHONOR ON
THIS INSTITUTION.
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE ETHICS 
COMMITTEE WOULD AGREE.
NEVERTHELESS TODAY I AM 
ANNOUNCING THAT IN THE COMING 
WEEKS I WILL BE RESIGNING AS A 
MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE.
I OF ALL PEOPLE AM AWARE THERE 
IS SOME IRONY BY THE FACT THAT I
AM LEAVING WHILE A MAN WHO 
BRAGGED ON TAPE ABOUT HIS 
HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SITS 
IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND A MAN WHO
HAS REPEATEDLY PREYED ON YOUNG 
GIRLS CAMPAIGNS FOR THE SENATE 
WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF HIS 
PARTY.
THIS DECISION IS NOT ABOUT ME.
IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF 
MINNESOTA.
IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT I CAN'T
BOTH PURSUE THE ETHICS COMMITTEE
PROCESS AND AT THE SAME TIME 
REMAIN AN EFFECTIVE SENATOR FOR 
THEM.
LET ME BE CLEAR, I MAY BE 
RESIGNING MY SEAT, BUT I'M NOT 
GIVING UP MY VOICE.
I WILL CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR 
THE THINGS I BELIEVE IN AS A 
CITIZEN AND AS AN ACTIVIST.
MINNESOTA DESERVES A SENATOR WHO
CAN FOCUS WITH ALL HER ENERGY ON
ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES THEY 
FACE EVERY DAY.
THERE IS A BIG PART OF ME THAT 
WILL ALWAYS REGRET HAVING TO 
WALK AWAY FROM THIS JOB WITH SO 
MUCH WORK LEFT TO BE DONE.
BUT I HAVE FAITH THAT THE WORK 
WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE I HAVE 
FAITH IN THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
HELPED ME DO IT.
I HAVE FAITH IN THE DEDICATED, 
FUNNY, SELFLESS, BRILLIANT YOUNG
MEN AND WOMEN ON MY STAFF.
THEY HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO 
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COUNTRY.
I HOPE THAT AS DISAPPOINTED AS 
THEY MAY FEEL TODAY, EVERYONE 
WHO HAS WORKED FOR ME KNOWS HOW 
MUCH I ADMIRE AND RESPECT THEM.
I HAVE FAITH IN MY COLLEAGUES, 
ESPECIALLY MY SENIOR SENATOR.
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO
THIS JOB WITHOUT HER GUIDANCE 
AND WISDOM.
I HAVE FAITH OR AT LEAST HOPE, 
THAT MEMBERS OF THIS SENATE WILL
FIND THE POLITICAL COURAGE 
NECESSARY TO KEEP ASKING THE 
TOUGH QUESTIONS, HOLD THIS 
ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE AND 
STAND UP FOR THE TRUTH.
I HAVE FAITH IN THE ACTIVISTS 
WHO ORGANIZED AND HELPED ME WIN 
MY FIRST CAMPAIGN AND WHO HAVE 
KEPT ON ORGANIZING TO HELP FIGHT
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEEDED US, 
KIDS FACING BULLYING, SENIORS 
WORRIED ABOUT THE PRICE OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, NATIVE 
AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN 
OVERLOOKED FOR FAR TOO LONG, 
WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
TAKING IT ON A CHIN FOR A 
GENERATION, EVERYONE IN THE 
MIDDLE CLASS AND EVERYONE 
ASPIRING TO JOIN IT.
I HAVE FAITH IN THE PROUD LEGACY
OF PROGRESSIVE ADVOCACY THAT I 
HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO BE A 
PART OF.
I THINK I PROBABLY REPEATED 
THESE WORDS 10,000 TIMES OVER 
THE YEARS.
PAUL WELL STONE'S FAMOUS QUOTE 
THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THOSE WHO 
ARE PASSIONATE AND WORK HARD.
IT'S STILL TRUE.
IT WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE.
MOST OF ALL I HAVE FAITH IN 
MINNESOTA.
A BIG PART OF THIS JOB IS GOING 
AROUND THE STATE AND LISTENING 
TO WHAT PEOPLE NEED FROM 
WASHINGTON.
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WHEN I'M 
HOME I AM BLOWN AWAY BY HOW MUCH
MINNESOTA HAS TO OFFER THE 
ENTIRE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE 
WORLD.
THE PEOPLE I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF
REPRESENTING ARE BRILLIANT AND 
CREATIVE AND HARD WORKING AND 
WHOEVER HOLDS THIS SEAT NEXT 
WILL INHERIT THE CHALLENGE I'VE 
ENJOYED FOR THE LAST 8 1/2 YEARS
BEING AS GOOD AS THE PEOPLE YOU 
SERVE.
THIS HAS BEEN A TOUGH FEW WEEKS 
FOR ME.
I AM A VERY, VERY LUCKY MAN.
I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY 
FAMILY THAT I LOVE AND THAT 
LOVES ME VERY MUCH.
I'M GOING TO BE JUST FINE.
I JUST LIKE TO END WITH ONE LAST
TH
THING.
I DID NOT GROW UP WANTING TO BE 
A POLITICIAN.
I CAME TO THIS RELATIVELY LATE 
IN LIFE.
I HAD TO LEARN A LOT ON THE FLY.
IT WASN'T EASY AND IT WASN'T 
ALWAYS FUN.
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT 
TODAY.
THIS IS A HARD THING TO DO WITH 
YOUR LIFE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF LONG HOURS 
AND LATE NIGHTS AND HARD 
LESSONS.
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ALL 
YOUR WORK AND SACRIFICE WILL 
EVER PAY OFF.
I WON MY FIRST ELECTION BY 312 
VOTES.
COULD HAVE EASILY GONE THE OTHER
WAY.
EVEN WHEN YOU WIN PROGRESS IS 
FAR FROM INEVITABLE.
PAUL WELL STONE SPENT HIS WHOLE 
LIFE WORKING FOR MENTAL LIFE 
PAIRTY AND IT DIDN'T PASS UNTIL 
SIX YEARS AFTER PAUL DIED.
THIS YEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 
DIDN'T GROW UP IMAGINING THAT 
THEY WOULD EVER GET INVOLVED IN 
POLITICS HAVE DONE JUST THAT.
THEY'VE GONE TO THEIR FIRST 
PROTEST MARCH OR MADE THEIR 
FIRST CALL TO A MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS OR MAYBE EVEN TAKEN THE
LEAP AND PUT THEIR NAMES ON A 
BALLOT FOR THE FIRST TIME.
IT CAN BE SUCH A RUSH TO LOOK 
AROUND A ROOM OF -- A ROOM FULL 
OF PEOPLE READY TO FIGHT 
ALONGSIDE YOU.
YOU FEEL THAT ENERGY TO IMAGINE 
THAT BETTER THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
YOU TOO WILL EXPERIENCE
>> THERE WILL BE DAYS WHERE 
YOU'LL WONDER WHETHER IT'S WORTH
IT.
WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS THAT 
EVEN TODAY, EVEN ON THE WORST 
DAY OF MY POLITICAL LIFE, I FEEL
LIKE IT'S ALL BEEN WORTH IT.
POLITICS, WE WERE TOLD, IS ABOUT
THE IMPROVEMENT OF PEOPLE'S 
LIVES.
I KNOW THAT THE WORK I'VE BEEN 
ABLE TO DO HAS IMPROVED PEOPLE'S
LIVES.
I WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN IN 
A HEARTBEAT.
FOR A DECADE NOW, EVERY TIME I 
WOULD GET TIRED OR DISCOURAGED 
OR FRUSTRATED, I WOULD THINK 
ABOUT THE PEOPLE I WAS DOING 
THIS FOR AND WOULD GET ME BACK 
UP ON MY FEET.
I KNOW THE SAME WILL BE TRUE FOR
EVERYONE WHO DECIDES TO PURSUE A
POLITICS THAT IS ABOUT IMPROVING
PEOPLE'S LIVES.
AND I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT I WILL 
BE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE YOU EVERY 
STEP OF THE WAY.
WITH THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, I 
YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> WITH THAT, THE NEWS, THE 
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR AL FRANKEN IS
RESIGNING HIS SEAT IN THE SENATE
IN THE COMING WEEKS, ON A DAY HE
CALLS THE WORST DAY OF HIS 
CAREER.
HE SAID THAT HE'S NEVER BROUGHT 
DISHONOR ON THE SENATE, 
RESPONDED IN SOME MEASURE FROM 
THE CALLS FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT 
WOMEN WHO ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT IN THE COMING WEEKS, 
SAYING ALL WOMEN DESERVE TO BE 
HEARD.
BUT SAYING THAT HE BELIEVES IN 
SOME OF THE CASES AT LEAST, THAT
THE ALLEGATIONS WERE NOT TRUE.
IN OTHERS THAT HE REMEMBERS THEM
DIFFERENTLY.
NEVERTHELESS, HE IS RESIGNING 
BECAUSE HE FEELS HE CANNOT SERVE
THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE 
PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM, WHILE AN
ETHICS COMMITTEE INVESTIGATES.
HE ALSO WENT ON IN THAT SPEECH 
TO CALL OUT BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND PRESIDENT SENATE CANDIDATE 
ROY MOORE OF ALABAMA, WHO ARE 
ALSO FACING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
ALLEGATIONS, DENYING THEM, 
NOTING THE IRONY, AS HE STEPS 
DOWN, THEY REMAIN IN OFFICE.
I WANT TO GO TO OUR TEAM NOW, 
STARTING WITH OUR SENIOR 
CONGRE
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT MARY
BRUCE ON HILL.
WE HEARD HIM DEFIANT, NOT 
CONTRITE, SAYING HIS ENTIRE 
CAREER WOULD BE WORTH IT.
CLEARLY HE WANTED TO STAY IN THE
SENATE, MARY.
YESTERDAY, AFTER ANOTHER 
ACCUSATION FROM AN ANONYMOUS 
SOURCE, IT WAS SIMPLY 
IMPOSSIBLE.
THE FLOODGATES OPENED FROM HIS 
DEMOCRATIC SENATE COLLEAGUES. 
>> Reporter: FRANKEN MADE IT 
CLEAR HE DOESN'T FEEL HIS 
ACTIONS WARRANT HIS RESIGNATION,
BUT WHAT IS ALSO CLEAR IS HE 
LOST THE SUPPORT OF HIS 
COLLEAGUES.
HIS FELLOW DEMOCRATS CAME OUT 
AND SAID, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
HE HAD TO RESIGN.
IT DID COME AFTER THAT LATEST 
ALLEGATION, THE ACCUSATIONS 
COMING OUT AGAINST HIM.
WE SAW A HANDFUL OF WOMEN 
SENATORS REALLY DRIVING THIS, 
COMING OUT IN WHAT APPEARED TO 
BE A COORDINATED PUSH, SAYING HE
HAD TO RESIGN.
THEN WE SAW IN LESS THAN 24 
HOURS NOW, AT LEAST 39 SENATORS 
WHO AGREED WITH THAT, INCLUDING 
THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER, CHUCK 
SCHUMER, WHO IS INCREDIBLY CLOSE
WITH AL FRANKEN BUT HAS SPENT A 
DIFFICULT LAST 24 HOURS, 
PERSONALLY PLEADING HIM TO DO 
WHAT HE JUST DID, STEPPING DOWN.
>> JOHN, AL FRANKEN CALLING OUT 
THE PRESIDENT THERE, AS WELL.
THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN CRITICAL 
OF SENATOR FRANKEN ON TWITTER, 
EVEN AS HE DEFENDS ROY MOORE.
WHAT YOU HAVE NOW IS BOTH AL 
FRANKEN AND DEMOCRATIC 
REPRESENTATIVE JOHN CONYERS 
RESIGNING, SETTING UP A CLEAR 
CONTRAST WITH SOME REPUBLICANS. 
>> CLEAR CONTRAST.
WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT LISTENING 
TO SENATOR FRANKEN IS HE REALLY 
DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK HE DID 
ANYTHING WRONG OR SIGNIFICANTLY 
WRONG, BUT HE POINTED OUT WHAT 
HE CALLED THE IRONY, THAT THE 
PRESIDENT, IN HIS WORDS, HAS 
ADMITTED ON TAPE TO COMMITTING 
SEXUAL ASSAULT.
HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT, YOU 
KNOW, SENATE CANDIDATE ROY MOORE
POSSIBLY ON HIS WAY TO THE U.S. 
SENATE IS GUILTY OF THINGS FAR 
WORSE THAN ANYTHING THAT FRANKEN
HAS ADMITTED TO OF BEEN ACCUSED 
OF.
HE NOTED THE IRONY.
THERE IS A CONTRAST HERE.
ONE SIGNIFICANT THING HERE THAT 
YOU MIGHT SAY HE HAS IN COMMON 
IS NO REAL ADMISSION OF DOING 
ANYTHING WRONG.
THE PRESIDENT ADAMANTLY INSISTS 
HE DID NOTHING WRONG, CALLED 
THAT "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD "TAPE 
LOCKER ROOM TALK.
ROY MOORE IS DENYING NOW THAT HE
DID ANYTHING WRONG IN TERMS OF 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TOWARD 
UNDERAGE GIRLS. 
>> ALSO OUR SENIOR NATIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN IN 
ALABAMA THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS 
COVERING THIS CAMPAIGN.
THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING 
MOMENT AS THIS ELECTION COMES UP
ON TUESDAY.
AS JOHN POINTED OUT, ROY MOORE 
AND THE PRESIDENT SIMPLY 
ABSOLUTELY DENY IN THE FACE OF 
SEVERAL WOMEN ACCUSERS, AS WELL 
AS -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS 
WE'VE SEEN IS A SHIFT AMONG THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS.
THEY STARTED OUT SAYING, ROY 
MOORE HAS TO GET OUT OF THE 
RACE.
THERE IS NO WAY HE CAN SERVE.
THEY'RE STARTING TO COME AROUND 
TO THE IDEA HE IS GOING TO BE 
SERVING. 
>> I THINK IT'LL BE BIGGER THAN 
THE SENATE.
THE RACE IN ALABAMA GOT SO MUCH 
BIGGER.
IF ROY MOORE WINS, A MAN ACCUSED
OF SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE 
BEHAVIOR WITH EIGHT WOMEN, 
ALMOST ALL OF THEM TEENAGERS, 
AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING TWO -- 
HE HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS --
BUT IF HE WINS THE RACE, HE GOES
TO THE U.S. SENATE.
EVERY REPUBLICAN UP FOR ELECTION
IS GOING TO BE ASKED THE SAME 
QUESTION, DO YOU STAND WITH ROY 
MOORE?
THIS IS A VERY BIG ISSUE.
THE NEWS CYCLE MOVES SO FAST 
RIGHT NOW.
BUT THIS ISSUE HAS PROVEN NOT TO
GO AWAY.
THE MID-TERMS, ONLY 11 MONTHS 
AWAY. 
>> LIKELY HE WILL END UP IN THE 
SENATE.
ETHICS COMMITTEE WHERE FRANKEN 
WILL BE INVESTIGATED.
AL FRANKEN, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR 
OF MINNESOTA, IS RESIGNING.
OUR COVERAGE IS GOING TO 
CONTINUE ONLINE.
