1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:01,367
KIDNEYS.

2
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:02,835
SIMILAR TECHNIQUE, NEIL.

3
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:03,603
>> Neil: THANKS, JOHN ROBERTS.

4
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,138
AS HE POINTED OUT, THE PRESIDENT

5
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:08,441
IS THERE NOW AT WALTER REED WITH

6
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,276
HIS WIFE.

7
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:15,181
ON THE PHONE WITH U.S. HAVE

8
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:15,882
DAVID FROM NEW YORK.

9
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,617
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

10
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,087
>> THANK YOU.

11
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,723
>> Neil: THIS LOOKS LIKE A

12
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,324
PREPLANNED EVENT TO HAVE THIS

13
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:26,159
TAKEN CARE OF.

14
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,361
IS THIS YOUR FIRST READ OF IT?

15
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,164
>> NEIL, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

16
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,334
NEED TO BE PREPLANNED FINDING.

17
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:38,371
A LOT OF TIMES WHAT WE'RE

18
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,507
FINDING IS INCIDENTAL FINDINGS

19
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:43,776
WHERE SOMEONE MAY HAVE VAGUE

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,214
SYMPTOMS, NAUSEA, VOMITING, BACK

21
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,816
PAIN, SOMETIMES A FAINT FEELING.

22
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:54,020
WE FIND THEM ON MRI AND CAT SCAN

23
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,323
TO HAVE A LESION IN THE KIDNEY.

24
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:01,894
JOHN WAS CORRECTED AND MY

25
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:06,132
DIAGNOSIS WOULD BE THE

26
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:06,899
ANGIOMYELYPOMA.

27
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,635
THIS IS A KIND OF BENIGN TUMOR

28
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:12,472
THAT WE USUALLY SEE IN THE

29
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,608
FOURTH TO SIXTH DECADES, USUALLY

30
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,142
AMONG WOMEN.

31
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,978
SHE'S A PERFECT MATCH FOR THIS

32
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,647
BENIGN TUMOR EVEN THOUGH WE'RE

33
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:22,048
SPECULATING.

34
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,649
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

35
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:26,719
A LOT OF TIMES, IF IT'S OVER 4

36
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,054
CENTIMETER, WE WOULD BE WORRIED

37
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,489
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GROWTH

38
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,625
IN THE FUTURE OR POSSIBLE

39
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,593
BLEEDING, WHICH IS WHAT SORT OF

40
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,094
THESE TUMORS CAN DO.

41
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,729
THEY CAN BURST AND CAUSE

42
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:37,797
BLEEDING IN THE BACK.

43
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,099
SO SURGICALLY, YOU KNOW, WE USED

44
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,636
TO DO -- REMOVE PART OF THE

45
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:44,604
KIDNEY YEARS AGO.

46
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,372
ONCE EMBOLIZATION CAME IN THE

47
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,709
PICTURE, MADE IT MUCH EASIER BY

48
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,713
PUSHING SOME OF THESE COILS OR

49
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,215
POLY VINYLS THAT WE CAN PUT IN

50
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:58,518
THESE TINY VESSELS THAT GO TO

51
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,185
THAT MASS.

52
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,388
OBVIOUSLY NOT THE REST OF THE

53
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:02,722
KIDNEY.

54
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,525
WE CAN SHRINK THOSE BENIGN

55
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,426
MASSES, THE TUMORS, AND SHRINK

56
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,929
THEM AND AVOID ANY KIND OF

57
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,163
SURGICAL TREATMENT.

58
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,398
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

59
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,200
THE REASON WHY THEY'RE WATCHING

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,635
OVER THEM TO MAKE SURE THIS IS

61
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,403
NOT AFFECTING HER KIDNEY

62
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:17,770
FUNCTION.

63
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,872
THE RID OF THE KIDNEY IS VIABLE.

64
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,607
THERE'S NO COMPLICATED AS FAR AS

65
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:22,909
BLEEDING, INFECTION AND THOSE

66
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,076
ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT THEY

67
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:24,944
HAVE TO LOOK FOR.

68
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,579
>> SO THE FACT THAT SHE'S IN THE

69
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,314
HOSPITAL A FEW DAYS AND WILL BE

70
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,249
THERE THROUGH THE BULK OF THE

71
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:32,018
WEEK, DOCTOR, SHOULD WE READ

72
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:32,585
INTO THAT?

73
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,921
A LOT OF FOLKS ARE E-MAILED AND

74
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,289
WORRIED WHAT ARE YOU TELLING

75
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:36,589
THEM?

76
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,157
>> NOT AT ALL.

77
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,092
SHE WILL GET BORED.

78
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,761
A LOT OF THESE ARE FAIRLY

79
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,128
ROUTINE.

80
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,430
WE HAVE BEEN DOING EMBOLIZATION

81
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,234
FOR THE LAST ALMOST 30, 40

82
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:48,834
YEARS.

83
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,305
AND I THINK IT'S BEEN USED FOR

84
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,007
LIVER NOW, PROSTATE INSTEAD OF

85
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:57,343
JUST SHAVING THE PROSTATE AND

86
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,581
EVEN AS JUST MENTIONED FOR MYOMA

87
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:05,851
IN WOMAN FOR HAVING THIS BIG

88
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,153
MASS ON THEIR UTERUS.

89
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,422
IF IT'S A ROUTINE PROCEDURE IN

90
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,023
MEDICINE, THIS IS A FAIRLY

91
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,892
ROUTINE PROCEDURE IN THE HANDS

92
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,293
OF AN INTERVENTION RADIOLOGIST

93
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:15,895
AND WE'RE GOING TO WATCH HER TO

94
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,163
MAKE SURE SHE'S FINE.

95
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,799
MY SPECULATION IS THAT OVER THE

96
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,667
NEXT TWO OR THREE DAYS, SHE

97
00:03:21,667 --> 00:00:00,000
SHOULD GO HOME WITHOUT ANY
