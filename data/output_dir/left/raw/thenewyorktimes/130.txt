1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,140
“Three, two, one …

2
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,640
Go ahead.

3
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,945
O.K.”

4
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,570
My name is Eva Schloss.

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,800
Would you like to ask me some
questions about my life?

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,055
“Why don’t you ask me a
question about Auschwitz?"

7
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,830
Why don’t you ask me a
question about Auschwitz?

8
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,060
Everybody said, Never
again, Auschwitz.

9
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,460
We have learned our lesson.”

10
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,080
But it looked bad
again in the world.

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,450
The hatred, discrimination.

12
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,150
So I thought it
really necessary

13
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,927
to teach and to
speak about it.

14
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:48,970
“My name is Pinchas Gutter.

15
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,950
I will answer any questions
you might have for me."

16
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:57,590
“How old were you
when the war ended?"

17
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,860
“I was between the
ages of 13 and 14

18
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,640
when the war ended in 1945."

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,205
But he doesn’t
move much, really.

20
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:09,975
And that’s his choice.

21
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:12,390
But it’s very Jewish to
talk with your hands.

22
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,279
Yes, it is.

23
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,945
And you should feel
comfortable to do.

24
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:15,528
And you can.

25
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:16,150
Exactly.

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,265
Yeah.

27
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:21,840
It’s going to be somewhat
normal in a hundred years’

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,610
time to have a person
sitting in this position.

29
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,770
And it won’t seem
as unnatural.

30
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,640
When you start to get
into the questions

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
and you start to
get into the dialog,

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,870
you kind of lose
sight of the fact

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,750
that the person’s
not actually there.

34
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,430
Gosh.

35
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,550
My goodness.

36
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,522
This is Andrew.

37
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:57,360
Yes.

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,967
Hi, Andrew.

39
00:02:57,967 --> 00:02:58,717
Nice to meet you.

40
00:02:58,717 --> 00:02:59,502
Nice to meet you.

41
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:00,002
Lisa.

42
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:01,575
This is Lisa, her
granddaughter.

43
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,950
Right now, there’s about a
hundred cameras on the stage.

44
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,950
So we’re recording
everything in all directions.

45
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,170
The idea behind the
green is that we can then

46
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,154
take out the green and replace
it with any other environment

47
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:13,070
that you’re going to be
talking in the future.

48
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,278
So this could be a classroom.

49
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,760
It could be a museum.

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,040
We could put those
backdrops behind you.

51
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,270
In the beginning, I didn’t
know really how to speak.

52
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,490
You know, I’m saying
you have to learn.

53
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,210
Eventually, I
found my own voice.

54
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,740
O.K., here we go.

55
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,775
Good morning.

56
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:51,705
Good morning.

57
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:53,500
How are you?

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,760
I’m feeling very well

59
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,485
A little nervous.

60
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:01,390
O.K. When did you first
start telling your story?

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,270
Since 1986, I started to
speak for the first time.

62
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,395
And I haven’t really
stopped since.

63
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,540
“Today is October
the 9th, 1996.

64
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,930
The survivor being
interviewed is Eva Schloss.

65
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,673
Maiden name Geiringer."

66
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:24,340
I realized suddenly that
people are interested

67
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,740
and people do want
to know about it.

68
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,100
And this was really, a big
turning point in my life.

69
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:36,620
This is a repeat after me.

70
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,980
“My name is Eva Schloss, and
I’m a Holocaust survivor."

71
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,225
My name is Eva Schloss.

72
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:44,705
I’m a Holocaust survivor.

73
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:47,130
“I’m actually a
recording, so I

74
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,105
can’t answer that question."

75
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,760
I’m actually a recording.

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,430
I can’t answer that question.

77
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,360
“I don’t remember."

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,657
I don’t remember.

79
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:02,010
“Maybe you should
try to reboot."

80
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,980
Maybe you should try to —

81
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,075
Reboot.

82
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:05,786
Rebook?

83
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,185
Reboot.

84
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:07,685
Reboo—

85
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:10,093
O.K., never mind.

86
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,180
Too technical for me.

87
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,750
I don’t quite imagine how
people will feel about that,

88
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,440
to pretend it is
somebody really speaking

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,310
to them who lived in that
time 30 or 50 years ago.

90
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:38,977
How did it feel to wear
the yellow star, Eva?

91
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:43,850
I was quite a stubborn
child, and I didn’t

92
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,290
want to wear the yellow star.

93
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,050
I didn’t see why
that was necessary.

94
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,790
And I had a big
fight with my mother.

95
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,170
I didn’t want to, but my
mother explained to me very,

96
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,950
very carefully
and thoroughly why

97
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,026
it was dangerous
not to wear it.

98
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,943
Can I just tell you,
these answers are great.

99
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:05,067
They’re just the right
length with the right amount

100
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:05,590
of details.

101
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,967
Wonderful.

102
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:07,467
Thank you.

103
00:06:10,855 --> 00:06:14,570
What happened when you
arrived at Auschwitz?

104
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,760
Men and women were separated.

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,770
So people clinged to
each other, cried.

106
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,490
And really, really horrible.

107
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,200
And they guards came
and beat us apart.

108
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,750
And my father took me
by the hand and said,

109
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,970
Eva, dear, God
will protect you.

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,490
I often think of actors who
do every day the same story.

111
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,110
I vary it because if I
would do the same thing all

112
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,840
the time, then I might
get fed up with it.

113
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:04,430
Have you come up with a
name for the contraption

114
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,875
that you’re in yet?

115
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,655
Cage.

116
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:07,740
The cage?

117
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,180
O.K.

118
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,375
Big cage.

119
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,040
So describe to us as the
most emotional situation

120
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,894
that you had to face while you
were in Auschwitz-Birkenau.

121
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:32,580
I think the biggest
shock I experienced

122
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:41,630
was when I saw my naked mother
walking out of this barrack,

123
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,750
knowing that she was
going to be gassed.

124
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,360
I think that was the hardest
moment I experienced.

125
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,400
And was she?

126
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:01,120
She was saved, and
we were reunited.

127
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,000
And she lived for a long,
long time till 93 years old.

128
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,170
I’d always seen it
in front of my eyes.

129
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,350
So I lived with it, really.

130
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,800
You know?

131
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,340
I saw the inside of the cattle
truck where we were moved.

132
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,799
I saw the arrival
in Auschwitz.

133
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,580
I saw everything.

134
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,179
At night especially,
when I was not busy.

135
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,760
You know, all those
images came back

136
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,230
till I started to
speak about it.

137
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,480
Then, I could let go.

138
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,960
O.K., this is over here.

139
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,830
Right here.

140
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,510
These are the gas chambers
over here in this area.

141
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,180
And these are the
forests around here.

142
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,680
Yeah.

143
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,580
The pond where you would
have gone to get water

144
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,273
is all around this area here.

145
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:23,372
How does it make you
feel looking at that?

146
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,320
Very confused because
when you were inside,

147
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,675
you had no idea —

148
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:33,670
Of how big it was
around it, yeah.

149
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,795
And where, and what, and how
things were connected to it.

150
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:37,745
Yeah, exactly.

151
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,740
And even when
I was there now,

152
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,570
I was completely disoriented.

153
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,910
There’s not a day goes by when
I am not thinking about them

154
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,090
in one way or another.

155
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,940
I wasn’t coping at
all after the war.

156
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,880
And it was Otto Frank who came
very often to our house who

157
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,700
saw how I was suffering, and
he really helped me a lot.

158
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,250
I don’t think I ever
replaced Anna for him.

159
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,410
I personally had the
feeling very often,

160
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,170
but that he never, ever made
me really, really think that.

161
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,400
But I just felt, that
when he looked at me,

162
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,070
I always thought,
is he thinking,

163
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,655
why did this child survive
and why not my own daughter?

164
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,170
Do you remember how
you felt about Anne

165
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,045
after you read the diary?

166
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:56,601
I must say, I wasn’t
particularly interested in it

167
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:57,100
at first.

168
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:01,775
Why not?

169
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:05,730
I was much too busy to
cope with my own grief.

170
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,360
Anna frank says in her
diary when she dies,

171
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,060
she would like to live on.

172
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,580
Meaning she wants
to become immortal.

173
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,900
And she has succeeded."

174
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,880
How did your daughters cope
with having two parents who

175
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,395
both experienced trauma?

176
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:42,340
As soon as they were
teenagers and older,

177
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,900
and started to know
more about our history,

178
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,630
I think they had
difficulties to cope with it.

179
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,050
To accept it.

180
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,270
She told us
anecdotes and stories,

181
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,810
but it was almost like it was
someone else’s experiences,

182
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,949
not her own.

183
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,240
There was a
certain time where

184
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,492
she didn’t want to talk about
it and was protecting us.

185
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:06,910
Our whole generation
has been uprooted.

186
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,050
And as a result of the
experiences through which

187
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,360
all of us have gone, we have
some psychological problems.

188
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,782
All of us, of one
kind or another.

189
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:25,680
And our anchor
to the future is

190
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,420
our children and
grandchildren,

191
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,230
which hopefully we’ll
find back into normality.

192
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,320
Great day.

193
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,190
Great day.

194
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,906
You’re going to
miss us, though.

195
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:53,207
Say I miss it?"

196
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:54,540
Yeah, you’re
going to miss it.

197
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,290
I’m not so sure.

198
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:00,180
That’s a wrap.

199
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,358
[applause]

200
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:04,570
Woo!

201
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,200
Bravo! Bravo!

202
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:14,005
[interposing voices]

203
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:16,530
So, back to normality.

204
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,292
Normality.

205
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:21,160
Although, you still picked
to wear gray silver.

206
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,660
Yeah.

207
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,420
I can’t go right into a
color after all this.

208
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:24,920
Yeah.

209
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,870
You need to ease
yourself back to color?

210
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,070
See you.

211
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,200
Say goodbye to the studio.

212
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,332
You didn’t say
goodbye to the cage.

213
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:35,832
No.

214
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,960
Here we go.

215
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,370
Usually, twice a week,
I go out speaking.

216
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,410
I said to my
daughters, who think

217
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:07,620
I don’t have to do all this,
I need it for my sanity.

218
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,770
Too hot?

219
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,980
Uh-uh.

220
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,700
I got over it, the suffering.

221
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,190
The only thing what I still
don’t get over really,

222
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,600
and I don’t think I
ever will, is the loss.

223
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:31,490
This project will
almost immortalize her,

224
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,890
so that she can go on
telling the story once she’s

225
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,700
no longer with us.

226
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,230
But it is still
a story, really.

227
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,240
It’s what it is.

228
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,460
Unless you live through it,
you can’t fully identify.

229
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,450
I hope you don’t forget
what you’ve heard here today.

230
00:14:56,130 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodbye.
