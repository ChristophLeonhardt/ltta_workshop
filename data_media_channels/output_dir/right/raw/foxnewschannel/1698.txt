IT LIKELY TO BENEFIT DEMOCRATS

8
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,386
AND THEIR EFFORTS TO FLIP THE

9
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:22,021

HIS CAMPAIGN ISSUED A STATEMENT

89
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,183
THAT SET APART THIS ELECTION

90
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:32,518
WILL BE A CHOICE FOR A CANDIDATE

91
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:34,920
THAT FIGHTS FOR INTERESTS THAT

92
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,991
STACK THE DECK AGAINST THEM.

93
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:39,925
TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY,

94
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,060
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND A

95
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,195
CANDIDATE WHO HAS SPENT YEARS TO

96
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,464
UNDERMINE, PRIVATIZE OR/THOSE

97
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:46,999
PROGRAMS.

98
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,300
IT WILL BE A CHOICE BETWEEN A

99
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,535
CANDIDATE WHO STANDS UP TO

100
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,236
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN IS WRONG

101
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,037
AND A CANDIDATE WHO BELIEVES

102
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:55,407
PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN DO NO WRONG.

103
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:56,942
FROM FRANKLIN AND MARSHALL

104
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:58,410
COLLEGE SAYS AT LEAST FOR NOW

105
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,214
CASEY, IT SEEMS, HAS THE EDGE.

106
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:03,616
>> HE'S KEPT THE CONNECTION TO

107
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,651
THE WORKING CLASS, UNLIKE A LOT

108
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,586
OF OTHER SORT OF URBAN DEMOCRATS

109
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:08,387
OF OTHER SORT OF URBAN DEMOCRAT

110
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:08,754
DEMOCRATS.

111
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,156
I ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT CASEY

112
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:10,789
IS FROM SCRANTON.

113
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,092
IF YOU ARE FROM SCRANTON YOU ARE

114
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:13,692
NOT AN URBAN DEMOCRAT.

115
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:17,997
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WORKING CLASS

116
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,597
TOWN.

117
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:19,798
BOTTOM LINE I THINK THE

118
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:20,566
SENATOR IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT

119
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:24,470
TO BEAT.

120
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,204
>> PART OF THAT WORKING-CLASS

121
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,539
THING THAT HE JUST TALKED ABOUT

122
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,007
IS THE SIGN.

123
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:28,574
LOOK AT THE SIGNAGE.

124
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:32,511
IT JUST SAYS ONE WORD, BLUE, NOT

125
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:33,812
THE LAST NAME.

126
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:34,947
HE SAYS BEFORE THIS ELECTION IS

127
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,415
OVER EVERY PENNSYLVANIAN WILL

00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:39,818
