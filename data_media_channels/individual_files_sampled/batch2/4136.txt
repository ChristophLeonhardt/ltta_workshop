thanks to at home for joining us this hour happy to have you with us Burgess Everett is a reporter reporter for Politico comm he covers Congress and out of all the beat reporters in national politics dedicated congressional reporters are often the most fun to watch and that's because of the sort of breadth of their their beat sometimes in Congress they are covering gigantic stories of national significance and even potentially international significance like confirmation hearings for a new justice for the United States Supreme Court sometimes they're covering you know the biggest story you can imagine but even when there isn't a huge earth-shaking story happening like that in Congress congressional B reporters still have to be there in Congress covering whatever is happening on any given day so yeah today a reporter like Burgess Everett at Politico got to cover the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Brett Kavanaugh huge deal right but he also had to cover the other stuff that happened in the Senate today which I learned from mr. Everett's Twitter feed today included the Senate apparently passing a resolution today confirming that September is school bus safety month I had no idea a couple of weeks ago he also had this little scoop lit you could put this under the category of might be important might not but I saw it here it is Mike Pence is having a very long chat with Democratic Senator Chris Coons hmm might be something might be nothing but for the record it was observed by a congressional beat reporter and therefore it was reported you also just sometimes get public facing complaints about Congress goat Dean Heller still won't talk to me or it's NotI Wednesday for Bernie Sanders I wouldn't have done that if we did not have beat reporters in national politics whose beat is congressman is an important might be sometimes not always but I'm glad somebody was there to report it and did so and on July 19th seven weeks ago urges Everett congressional reporter for Politico comm was apparently right outside senator dick durbin office on the cap in the Capitol because he's a congressional beat reporter right but for whatever reason he ended up at that exact spot at a very opportune moment and he was able to report this quote McConnell withdraws bounds nomination I can hear Democrats literally cheering in senator Durbin's office now that day in the US Senate Democrats were not going around in the halls openly cheering and celebrating what had just happened but they apparently did burst into cheering behind closed doors doors that apparently we're not thick enough to block shoe-leather congressional reporters at least one of them from hearing them start to shout and celebrate inside Senator Durbin saw what the Democrats were celebrating that day was this guy not becoming a judge for everything else the Trump administration has proven itself incapable of doing they have been just a juggernaut at confirming conservative judges Republicans in the Senate under President Obama had a strategy about this they held open every single judicial seat they could for as long as they could including even a seat on the US Supreme Court they just would not let the Obama White House put any federal judges through and so in the Obama years with Republicans in control of the Senate the vacancies for judicial seats just mounted and mounted and mounted for years and then having followed that strategy for years Republicans finally got their payoff when a Republican president was elected and they were ready and they launched hundreds of conservative nominees all at once all for lifetime appointments and there were plenty of vacancies for them to fill because Republicans had held all those seats open with control of the Senate Republicans have been running those nominees through like factory-made chocolates on an out-of-control conveyer belt faster-faster-faster it's almost like they think this administration might not last so they've got a hurry through as many of these nominations as they can but on July 19th despite this well-oiled if fairly frantic system one of their judicial nominees failed his name was Ryan bounce he was a conservative prosecutor in Oregon the Trump administration nominated him to a federal appeals court just one level below the US Supreme Court and again in general Republicans in the Senate have been ramming through Trump nominees by the by the fistful but this Ryan bounced nomination was stopped and it was stopped because number one all Democrats in the Senate opposed to em Democrats were united in their opposition to Ryan bounds and number two senator Tim Scott also opposed him senator Tim Scott the lone african-american Republican member of the United States Senate turns out this nominee had a robust lengthy history of really inflammatory racial writings none of which he had turned over to the Judiciary Committee when they were supposedly vetting him for a lifetime appointment to a federal appeals court the nominee had also appointed himself associated himself with some some racially sort of crass stuff when he was opinion editor of a conservative campus newspaper for example that paper started using this nice angry Indian cartoon caricature to illustrate his section of the paper they did that apparently particularly because there had been a history of Native American groups objecting to that kind of insensitive racial caricature at that campus I can say that from experience because I went to the same school as this guy at the same time and I remember those fights but despite the racially inflammatory stuff in this nominees written record in his past and despite the fact that he had apparently tried to hide those writings from the Senate his domination did appear to be on track to get confirmed through the Republican Senate anyway on what was expected to be a party line vote until senator Tim Scott decided he was not okay with this guy he was not willing to vote for this judge who had who had publicly mused on Aryan student unions and what he called feelgood ethnic hoedowns and quote ethnic elites according to Burgess efforts reporting at the time in Politico calm senator Tim Scott started to voice his concerns and the possibility that he might vote no on this nominee just one day before the vote was scheduled on Ryan bounds apparently senator Scott personally then spoke to the nominee himself to try to assuage his concerns that did not work then Senator Scott reportedly went to talk to his friend Senator Marco Rubio about his concerns the two of them together Rubio and Scott decided they would talk together to the nominee they did so that still did not work afterwards senator Tim Scott apparently said nope I am NOT doing it you cannot have my vote for this nominee Senator Marco Rubio then reportedly said okay if you're voting no senator Scott then I will join you in that too and that was all it took Ryan bounces nomination died and Burgess effort was there to hear the Democrats cheering about it behind the doors of senator dick durbin Sophos that was seven weeks ago Republicans are in control of the US Senate obviously but only barely they only have a 51 to 49 majority at the time of that Ryan bounce nomination seven weeks ago that's when Senator John McCain was out sick and so at that point it wasn't 5149 it was 50 to 49 that meant it would only take one Republican defection to sink any judicial nominee or any other vote of any kind in the Senate as long as Democrats stayed unified in opposition well now with Senator John McCain having passed he's been replaced now by Senator John Kyl who is now sworn in in the Senate now it's back up to 51 49 but that still means if only two Republican senators peel off on any one vote or any one nomination as long as the Democrats are unified that vote or that nominee is toast and now after more than 31 hours of confirmation hearings for Brett Cavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court this week it is becoming clear that Democrats are proceeding on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court with that very very narrow vote margin in mind there have been some it's I think the way to say it forgive me I I think there's been some quite a lot of facile commentary and I don't mean that to be snarky or mean to anyone in particular but I think there's been a ton of facile commentary and some headlines that you might have seen suggesting that Democrats are trying to make a big spectacle out of the Brent Cavanaugh confirmation process because the Democrats are in the minority and there's therefore no way they can stop this nomination so they're just setting off fireworks pointlessly to try to get attention and make a scene and and and you've seen reporting and you've seen commentary that that's in particular what the Democrats have been doing with these stunts they've been pulling about releasing documents from Cavanaugh's history documents that the Republicans say should be confidential you know what if Democrats were just trying to make a spectacle out of the Cavanaugh confirmation process if they knew it was a futile effort he was definitely going to be confirmed anyway no matter what they did if they just wanted to make a stink there are easier and more fun ways to do that that's not what they're doing what's now become clear after these three long days of hearings is that the Democrats aren't just trying to make a spectacle of the confirmation process here they appear to be actually trying to block Brett Cavanaugh's confirmation they appear to be actually trying to win Democrats are not used to seeing this and their elected officials so I'm not sure this is being recognized rightly because because but look at what they're doing they're not just making sort of sound and fury here they're doing something specific to try to win to try to stop Cavanaugh's nomination and they may not win but it I think it's worth being clear that that is what they're going for they are apparently aware that it is sort of a close question here for a number of reasons right this nominee is actually super unpopular nationwide polling shows that this nominee is less popular than any other modern Supreme Court nomination since Harriet Miers the reason I'm not saying justice Harriet Miers is because she never made it at the Supreme Court she had to withdraw her nomination when it became clear that she had nowhere near enough support to proceed public support for Brett Cavanaugh's nomination is even lower than what Harriet Miers enjoyed before she had to withdraw in at least one national poll public support for Brett Cavanaugh's nomination is even lower than what we saw for Robert Bork who also did not become a Supreme Court justice now just judge Bork insist as I insisted on going all the way through to a vote and not withdrawing the way that Harriet Miers did but Bork was rejected by a fairly large bipartisan majority in the Senate that was a failed nomination because he didn't have enough support Brett Kavanaugh public support is lower than what Robert Bork had when he failed to get confirmed and public support isn't everything right the public doesn't get a direct vote on Supreme Court nominees but it is striking in this case that support is so low for Cavanaugh and ultimately that kind of thing does end up mattering to Senate mattering to senators if they have reason to really seriously consider their vote here ultimately it does matter to elected officials particularly right before an election when more Americans don't want Brent Cavanaugh confirmed then do want him confirmed and in national polling Brett Kavanaugh is underwater that way more people want him rejected then want him confirmed and in that environment with a weak and unpopular nominee having been chosen for the position by a weak and unpopular president who has been named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal felony case and is at the center of a huge counterintelligence and criminal investigation that is literally going to result in one of his campaign aides being sentenced probably to prison tomorrow in the middle of Brett Cavanaugh's confirmation hearings while jury selection proceeds for his campaign chairman who has already been convicted on eight felony counts and is up for more I mean in that environment with a weak and unpopular nominee nominated by a weak and unpopular and endangered president and with a razor-thin Republican majority in the Senate Democrats are not throwing up their hands and being like we got no choice here we got no chance can't do nothing let's just make noise I mean Democrats have one small specific task this week and it is not to change the world's perception of Brett Kavanaugh or the world's perception of President Trump or to somehow transform the Republican caucus in the Senate somehow know all they need to do is peel off two Republican senators persuade them to decide for their own reasons that they can't vote for this man what Democrats are doing here is not a turn on the sprinkler strategy this is an aim the squirt gun strategy for example there are two Republican senators who say they are pro-choice who have made clear to their constituents back home for years actually in both of their cases for decades that they will not provide the vote that leads to overturning Roe vs. Wade and making abortion illegal up until now senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Senator Susan Collins of Maine have indicated that they are satisfied with Brett Kavanaugh saying he views Roe vs. Wade as settled law we talked about whether he considered rode to be settled law he said that he agreed with what Justice Roberts said at his nomination hearing in which he said that it was settled law we had a very good thorough discussion about that as you and many others said senator Susan Collins of Maine one of two Republican pro-choice senators the other is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska saying there with apparently indicating some satisfaction that Brett Cavanaugh told her that he considered Roe vs. Wade to be settled law that by susan collins his own admission it is something that is important to her something that matters to her in terms of her vote on this nomination well today somebody leaked to the New York Times and then to NBC News this email written by Bret Kavanagh in 2003 in which he argues explicitly that Roe vs. Wade is not recognized to be settled law because the Supreme Court could very well overturn it quote I am Not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe is the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since court can always overrule its precedent and three current justices on the court would do so at the time Brett Kavanaugh was writing that in 2003 was probably right that three justices on the court then would have voted to overturn Roe right now there are certainly four justices who are expected to be votes to overturn Roe and judge Brett Kavanaugh is widely believed to be the long-awaited fifth vote to do just that if they ever put him on the court so that email first made public today despite it being stamped confidential by the Republicans it raises a few questions first of all why was that email marked confidential and not released to the public what about that was inappropriate for the public to know about judge Cavanaugh and his views I mean that was him commenting on a on a proposed op Edie what's the national security sanctity of a proposed op Edie that means we all need to be protected from his suggested edits to that document but also how do senators like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins look at that and explain to their constituents that they're still confident that he'll treat roe is settled law that there's no chance he believes that it could even be overturned it's there in black and white that he doesn't believe that settled law at all that he absolutely thinks it could be overturned again what Democratic senators appear to be pursuing here is not a broadcast strategy to persuade the public right to persuade the media the strategy around releasing the ROE memo and and I say it's a democratic strategy because NBC News said explicitly today that when they got it they got it from quote democratic sources this strategy is aimed at two specific Republican senators it has an audience a very specific audience and those two senators have admitted that they will base their vote in part on that issue I mean whether or not anybody else has moved or persuaded about the certainty of Cavanaugh's a vote to make abortion illegal right whether or not this memo persuades anybody about that the key question is whether lisa murkowski and susan collins are persuaded by the release of this memo hawaii said that our mazie Hirono also thwarted the confidentiality that republicans tried to assert on Cavanaugh's documents by releasing this one from Cavanaugh's time in the george w bush white house in 2002 this is Brett Kavanaugh writing June 4th 2002 to another White House official quote I think the testimony needs to make clear that any program targeting Native Hawaiians as a group is subject to strict scrutiny and of questionable validity under the Constitution now that is a very specific issue why would mazie Hirono be going out on a limb as a senator to break the supposed confidentiality of these documents in order to release this specific document from Brett Kavanaugh past it's not on a lot of different issues as specific to this one thing it's that one statement basically it's a document now is this kind of an issue gonna turn the national tide against Brett Kavanaugh no that specific document might not even garner a single national headline when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh but you don't need to turn the tide you don't need to turn the whole country you need two votes you need to turn two Republican senators and so who is mazie Hirono targeting here she's not being subtle about it she's very much spelling it out when she announced that she was releasing this document quote I referred to a committee confidential document where Judge Cavanaugh questioned the validity of programs that benefit Native Hawaiian programs and by extension Alaska Natives and in case it's still not clear enough that this Democratic effort is specifically targeted specifically designed narrowcast to make it impossible for Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski to vote for this nominee mazie Hirono really is willing to put that fine a point on it I think you have a problem here your view is that Native Hawaiians don't deserve protections as indigenous people under the Constitution and your argument raises a serious question about how you would rule on the constitutionality of programs benefiting Alaska Natives I think that my colleagues from Alaska should be deeply troubled by your views my colleagues from Alaska so we've got Democrats giving susan collins and lisa murkowski a reason to vote no on Kavanagh by showing that Cavanaugh actually doesn't think Roe versus Wade a settled law they've both said that specific aspect of his record is key to their vote in addition we've got Lisa Murkowski getting another reason to vote now mazie Hirono taking it upon herself to expose to the public this document that shows that lisa murkowski might have a real problem back home with the considerable Alaska native vote in her home state if she votes for this nominee who's absolutely on the record hostile to programs that benefit them or recognize them and and and you might have seen this morning's this this morning mazie Hirono announcement that she had released these documents it came right after senator Cory Booker stopped the show today when he announced that he was willing to risk expulsion from the Senate if necessary to release documents that again had inexplicably been marked confidential and hidden from the public once he wanted to release included Cavanaugh s communications about racial profiling and affirmative action thanks to that action by Democrats in the Senate we now have this document here's Brett Kavanaugh in 2001 calling affirmative action quote a naked racial set-aside and he was not just opining in general this is him talking about a Department of Transportation program that's supposed to benefit minority-owned contractors for getting government contracts he calls it a quote naked racial set-aside he's also on the record calling a government program for Native Hawaiians a quote naked racial spoils system it's almost like when when Judge Ryan bounds wrote about the ethnic elites except oh wait Ryan bounds never became a judge because Republican senator Tim Scott and maybe even Republican Senator Marco Rubio decided they could not stomach that kind of past writing on a race for a judicial nominee and they decided that just a few weeks ago and that nomination failed and at least one reporter heard the Democrats cheering they don't need them all they don't need the media they don't need you know they don't need to they don't need to entertain any of us they just need to votes and those no votes can be for any reason at all that that's important to those two Republican senators so the Democrats did blow up the process again a little bit today by calling Republicans Bluff on what Kavanagh documents could be shown to the public but it's not a blind eruption of some kind designed to get attention when you look at the stuff they're releasing and the way they're releasing it and presenting it in these hearings it's clear this is a very tightly targeted effort to speak meaningfully to specific Republican senators who really might have concerns with specific substantive elements of Brett Cavanaugh's record that would otherwise not have been let out of committee and would not have made it into the newspaper for the most part it appears that the Republican senators are really being targeted here in this effort are not senators who are members of the Judiciary Committee so when Democrats released these documents that have been marked committee confidential those are documents that otherwise wouldn't have been seen by anybody off the committee when they're releasing these documents that may be the only way they can let senator Tim Scott know that Brett Kavanaugh says affirmative action is a naked racial set-aside that may be the only way they can let senator Lisa Murkowski know what Brett Kavanaugh would do to Native Alaskans that may be the only way they can lay it out as clearly as possible for senator Lisa Murkowski and Senators Susan Collins that Brett Kavanaugh really doesn't think that row is settled law he really does think the court could overturn that it's not just noise here there is a melody there is a method to what they are doing and alongside that there are two other things going on here that we're going to talk about over the course of this evening number one is this now quite robust Democratic effort to show that not one not two not three not four but it's been his five different subjects Brent and Brett Kavanaugh may have lied to the Senate in his last appearance before them he was first up for confirmation as a judge more than 10 years ago Democrats have been probing around the edges of that allegation since Kavanaugh was named as a nominee to the High Court today they started laying out the proof we'll have more on that coming up and then in addition there is the drama that has been unleashed by California Senator Kamala Harris judge have you ever discussed Special Counsel Mahler or his investigation with anyone well it's in the news every day I have you discussed it with anyone with other judges I know have you discussed Muller or his investigation with anyone at Casa wits Benson and Torrez the law firm founded by Mark Castle its president Trump's personal lawyer all right be sure about your answer sir well I'm not remembering but if you have something you want uh are you certain you've not had a conversation I got anyone at that law firm Kazu it's Benson Kassovitz Benson and Torres which is the law firm founded by Mark Kassovitz who is president Trump's personal lawyer are you have you had any conversation about robert muller or his investigation with anyone at that firm yes or no well is there a person you're talking about and my question is have you had a conversation with anyone at that firm about that investigation it's a really specific question I would like to know the person you're thinking of because what if they think you're thinking of someone you don't want to tell us who did you have a conversation with it I am I'm not mr. chairman I I'd like to raise an objection here this town is only law firms law firms are full of people Stovall I'd like you to last the clock thank you the clock is pause thank you that was the cliffhanger that we were left with at the end of last night's questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh where did that come from what does that mean well senator Kamala Harris has just had another round of questioning with Brett Cavanaugh she went back to him again on that tonight we've got that ahead for you in just a moment and then we think depending on what happens in that crew hearing room we think we may have senator Harris joining
