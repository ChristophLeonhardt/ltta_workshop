reverberating through my head<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,190
shrink away like no with the talking

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,769

head right now so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like the</font>

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,379
open bar and it was very like and

22
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,090
everyone looked really important and

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,770
though everyone's taking pictures and

24
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,230
flogging and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like what is this I</font>

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,890
out there first I really did<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy it</font>

27
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,140
physically I'm kind of regretting all

28
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,449
the free alcohol now look beneath<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

29
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,340
blanket and still<font color="#CCCCCC"> wearing clothes from</font>

30
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,920
yesterday it made<font color="#E5E5E5"> me think about it made</font>

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,409
me think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we youtube's changed</font>

32
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,729
on the time I've been here I met a few

33
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,770
people who are like ah so you've got a

34
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube channel how long have you been</font>

35
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,640
doing you too well I'll tell you

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,790
stirring stranger for years and they'll

37
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,320
always had this like they had this

38
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,200
reaction where they were like oh that's

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,140
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really long time looks like is it</font>

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,610
at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> the YouTube community did</font>

41
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,570
a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who bit like they've</font>

42
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,220
been doing videos like six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months or a</font>

43
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,450
year and they've blown<font color="#E5E5E5"> up really big</font>

44
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,759
dozen people were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it for like six</font>

45
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,799
or seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years so when they kind of</font>

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,229
collide it's like each party is confused

47
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,759
by the other like the people human doing

48
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,960
it for a really long time and maybe

49
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,780
aren't really famous<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like oh this is</font>

50
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,270
interesting you're like king of a world

51
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,100
that you weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even aware of a year</font>

52
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,020
ago how interesting for you how is that

53
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,460
affecting you and then like the people

54
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,869
who haven't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it very long and</font>

55
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,939
I can't imagine what it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to have</font>

56
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,040
been doing it that long and just made me

57
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">think a lot about the way the</font>

58
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,310
communities change and I don't know if

59
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,450
you agree with me here but I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

60
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,049
we've become very horizontal 19 year old

61
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,399
me would've been like I'm at a party in

62
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,680
the Google studios and like I still want

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be psyched for that tiny little</font>

64
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,919
teenager inside me

65
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just looking around</font>

66
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,800
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was party being like these are just</font>

67
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
all people and like every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've met</font>

68
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,880
somebody real from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font>

69
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,700
so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person I had some really</font>

70
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,020
really valuable relationships come out

71
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,670
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube to name but a few the</font>

72
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,250
welcoming bosoms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> say sana meron and</font>

73
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,230
rosianna one unexpectedly got a job in

74
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,520
London<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to move straight away they</font>

75
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,140
welcomed<font color="#CCCCCC"> me into their home and their</font>

76
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,700
lives and their friendship groups and

77
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,560
their activities but I will forever be

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,940
grateful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

79
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,500
a lot of genuine friends from<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

80
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,760
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you prevent somebody for a</font>

81
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,989
while you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that thing where people</font>

82
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:41,730
go how did you guys meet and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

83
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of stop for a minute and think</font>

84
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how you met</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about that</font>

85
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,709
common occurrence and intermingled with

86
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,810
the experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being in the Google</font>

87
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,610
studios and kind of like networking with

88
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,010
people which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is weird because actually</font>

89
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,060
the only thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't come with</font>

90
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,980
people i also have a youtube channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

91
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,819
make videos videos on a thing I mean

92
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,500
they are a thing they're capturing a

93
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,910
thing they're not a thing in themselves

94
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,769
do you see what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to</font>

95
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,150
arrogantly an automatic do you think

96
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,819
that I have a affinity with all the

97
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,010
people who make videos is a very strange

98
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,660
concept when you think about what video

99
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,549
actually is when Google obviously move

100
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,380
towards making great relationships

101
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,750
between creators and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a</font>

102
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,880
horizontal if you like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of community</font>

103
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,840
from why I've seen this with some

104
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,250
awesome friendships and some awesome

105
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,989
collaborations between people but I

106
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it might have made us forget about</font>

107
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,160
the vertical you know isn't a playing

108
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,690
field or it's like all kind of content

109
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,340
creators have similar interests and all

110
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,930
should all be friends it doesn't make

111
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,549
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of other parties I've been</font>

112
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,260
to an ass humans like full<font color="#E5E5E5"> of maybe like</font>

113
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,670
there might be full<font color="#E5E5E5"> of teachers</font>

114
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,950
politicians people work for charity the

115
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,209
way I see it is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could find an</font>

116
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,970
affinity at any party and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anything</font>

117
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kind of multiple interactions I've</font>

118
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,730
had two people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet teaches</font>

119
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,200
me but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> having youtube channel is</font>

120
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,930
only a starting remark it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even a</font>

121
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,400
starting conversations just starting

122
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,230
remark I you know meet you channel cool

123
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,209
let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note sure there is humans</font>

124
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,560
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people can't do that and</font>

125
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,660
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not SAT and whether I like it or</font>

126
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,430
not the multiple kind of interactions

127
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,930
I've had with lots and lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

128
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,910
who also do YouTube over the years<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

129
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,889
gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of two ways either we never get</font>

130
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,510
past that initial observation of like oh

131
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,940
you make youtube videos I make youtube

132
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,220
videos cool i'm gonna this person<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

133
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,440
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back they never come</font>

134
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,570
back never comes back oh you know use

135
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,070
that arbitrary algorithm of

136
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,140
ridiculousness<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

137
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,930
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're sitting</font>

138
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,910
with the matter am drinking cider and

139
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,110
plastic bottle and wondering about

140
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,150
predestination and relationship if you

141
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,190
know one of two ways each way is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I</font>

142
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's interesting that the bigger</font>

143
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:33,620
you become on<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube the more you're</font>

144
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,750
encouraged to socialize horizontally

145
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,400
what you get is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room full of</font>

146
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,470
youtubers who all don't necessarily even

147
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,120
watch each of those channels which ever

148
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,500
way you play it scientifically I'm Way

149
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,820
more likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something in common</font>

150
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,289
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my videos rather</font>

151
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,759
than if you're somebody who also makes

152
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,620
videos and I wonder if the value of the

153
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,660
community is being dictated by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

154
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,650
and not by a common interest what do you

155
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about YouTube has it become to</font>

156
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,220
