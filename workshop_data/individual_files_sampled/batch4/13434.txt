the Commission on Presidential Debates announced its selection for this year's absolutely fair debate moderators the announcement came on the Friday before the Labor Day weekend in the hopes no one would be around to hear how absolutely fair the moderators are they'd be too busy not hearing the FBI dump on how absolutely honest Hillary Clinton is in a statement to the media debate Commission President Huma Abedin said quote we sincerely hope our blatant display of bias will communicate our contempt for the American people and their election process as Democrats we trust we have injected enough self hatred into the minds of the voters that they will willingly choose to elect those of us who despise them unquote the list of moderators elevates some of the finest journalists in the country by giving them the evening off and instead appoints people certain to ask searing questions of any candidate who hates women so much he would try to stop the rise of the first female president a great lady who must be treated gently because she just isn't feeling very well the absolutely fair moderators include Michael Sanford we know this charming 20 year old British man will be fair because he actually attended a Trump rally at the Treasure Island casino in Las Vegas and all right yes he attempted to steal a policeman's gun and assassinate Trump all he was there but he now promises to ask both candidates equally probing questions which he hopes will allow him to get close enough to Trump to get off a clean shot this time another absolutely fair moderator will be the chant a Fox senior Fox said he would graciously take time off from being President of Mexico to teach that gringo sob with the neurons a comb-over not to go around calling Mexicans criminals to prove they are not criminals Senor Fox said he would bring a couple of Mexican policemen on stage to drag the candidate into a van tie him to a chair and torture a confession out of him the way they do with everyone who dares to stand up against the cartels senior Fox insisted the Mexican policeman would be completely fair in the questions they asked mr. Trump while shocking him with a cattle prod when someone explained to Fox that in fact he was no longer the President of Mexico Fox Juan wandered around in a daze wondering why he was still carrying a saber and his Admirals hat the final absolutely fair moderator of the debates will be a wax dummy of Franklin Roosevelt who through the miracle of animatronics will deliver pre-recorded questions that are absolutely fair to both candidates even though his recorded voice sounds strangely like Hillary Clinton's among the questions that will be delivered to the Democrat candidate will be can I have your cookie recipe and how much does it mean to you to be a grandmother among the questions delivered to the Republican candidate will be why can't you just die and why are you still here didn't I tell you to die the first absolutely fair debate is scheduled to be held September 26th between Donald Trump on the one side and Hillary Clinton and CNN's Candy Crowley on the other trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew clay we showed it was yeah it sounds all right exactly it's I use it's not even I sometimes wonder whether I'm actually writing satire or living in a satire

namely me you can get it now and send your receipt to eight Clavin is it a Clavin today Lee Weyer calm and I'll send you a signed sticker you can put in the book all right let's take a look at what's happening in the polls remember we have this CNN poll and Hillary Clinton says she doesn't pay attention to polls so you know it's bad right and NBC what I love is NBC recalibrated the poll the poll shows Trump up like 2% in nationwide so NBC recalibrated the poll to turn the turnout to 2012 which is never gonna happen right and then Trump was behind but that you know I don't know why they just no scribble on you know these are the numbers we would like to say all right so there's a big new poll out Fred Cole of the daily shot that which is the Ricochet newsletter says 50 individual there's a Washington Post survey monkey just released a massive poll of all 50 states Hillary Clinton is ahead by four or more points in 20 states adding up to two hundred and forty four electoral votes of the 270 she needs Trump is also ahead by four or more points in twenty states but his only add up to 126 electoral votes there are another 10 states with 168 electoral votes where the lead is smaller than four points the poll shows Trump ahead in Iowa and Ohio and the race is close in Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin it also showed the Texas to be a dead heat which is very very hard to believe but that's what rodent was a wide sample Doug shown shown I guess that's how he pronounces his name he was in The Wall Street Journal today saying it he's the pollster former pollster for Bill Clinton and he says it is not impossible that even though Hillary has a lead and she has a lot of advantages in the electoral college it's not impossible for Trump to win now he says he should concentrate on the Midwest and focus on the angry white voters were all out of work and their jobs went to China their jobs on to China and you listen you know Hillary Clinton Hillary was on the plane where remember she said she's now gonna talk more to two reporters she's so chic she gets up in the plane and she's talking to reporters and somebody asked her about the CNN poll thank you thank you very much all right so that's you know to be fair she later came on and said I don't pay attention to polls which always means a politician is worried because that's all they do that is their job their job is defined as looking at the polls and trying to figure out who the game and who to talk doing all this stuff all right so now we this some the charges are going back and forth and first of all there is the health thing her latest coughing fit really raised some concerns nothing to see here she's absolutely fine I love this I love this idea going around where the reporters are debating whether or not it's a story that Hillary Clinton is cause she says she's taking more anti histamines it's a an allergy I have you can hear I clear my throat a lot I have allergies like that that make it difficult for me to talk in certain seasons you know probably that's true I guess it says it makes she's lies about everything so it's hard to believe her about anything and this idea that the press is going to debate you know what's a story they covered McCain's health when he was running let me tell you some stuff that's not a story it's not a story when a soldier dies in a war an individual soldier dies in war that's not a news story and yet when George W Bush was president every single soldier who died in the Iraq war was on the front page of the New York Times it was a big story suddenly Obama came to office more soldiers died on his watch in Afghanistan and for no apparent reason but suddenly they disappeared from the front page so you know it's a story when you say it's a story that's basically it it's not a story when a thug is killed by a cop while he's resisting arrest that's not a story either and you know I mean that's interesting here is a story that this did make the the times the body of an activist from st. Louis who led protests against the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri was found with a gunshot wound in the charred remains of a vehicle so that's gonna be interesting this is Darren seals was found in his burned car shot that's I don't mean to laugh at the poor man being shot but it's gonna be an interesting story to find out what that happened all right so what's really going on now is they're throwing charges of corruption back and forth Hillary is fighting back against the charge that she's the most corrupt dessicated twisted empty soulless you know human being who has ever run for any office anywhere in a civilized country she's charging back that Donald Trump has done some bad things too here is Hillary attacking Trump has been bankrupted in his company's six times he's been sued about four thousand times he's been accused repeatedly of fraudulent behavior his so-called Trump University is under investigation right now because of the way it has scammed so many students who thought they get a better opportunity in life and we recently learned that his Trump Foundation has been fine for illegal activity when it made a political contribution to the Attorney General of Florida at the time she was being asked by her constituents to investigate Trump University because of the effects that these people that she's responsible for had experienced and of course as we know there was a phone conversation between them they contradict each other the American people deserve to know what was said because clearly the Attorney General did not proceed with the investigation so of course the New York Times The Guardian of our morals which has been covering every twist and turn of Hillary Clinton's you know corruption with her emails on page 30 X of the night edition splatters the front page with this Pam Bondi thing Trump is suppose is said to have donated $25,000 to a group supporting Pam Bondi Bondi the Attorney General of Florida who is now a Trump supporter and she is said to have ditched her investigation of Trump University here's Pam Bondi responding to Neil Cavuto they're going after Donald Trump and specifically you over his failure to disclose a $25,000 contribution a few years back a 2013 - a political group that was connected to you and and whether to open a fraud investigation against Donald Trump that this smells bad according to one Clinton official what do you say smells bad well let me tell you I will not be collateral damage in a presidential campaign nor will I be a woman bullied by Hillary Clinton this is about her trying to deflect everything she did as Secretary of State and as you saw we've sent a retraction notice to new papers who have printed anything about this that's absolutely untrue and Hillary Clinton will not bully me so I love it the woman card played back right Hillary Clinton plays the woman card I play your women card and I double my women card you will not believe me the problem with all this is first first of all Trump was not a public official so that immediately lowers the bar the guy is the guy corrupt well listen to him Trump Trump told Brett Baier during the debates this is what he does I will tell you that our system is broken I give too many people before this before two months ago as a businessman I give to everybody when they call I give and you know what when I need something from them two years later three years later I call them they are there for me so what that's a broken system what you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi well I'll tell you what with Hillary Clinton I said be it my wedding and she came to my wedding you know why she had no choice because I gave I gave to a foundation that frankly that foundation is supposed to do good I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world it was you kind of love him you got I mean that's that's listen that's how he got nominated in the first place and hey it's true the guy is a construction guy in New York that means he dealt with the mob there's no way to get a building built in New York without dealing with the mob that's that's how it works you know and so like all that stuff his line is going to be I that yeah that's right politicians are corrupt I know I've been buying them for years but I will not be that guy that's his line we'll see if it works but he definitely is protected by the fact that he was not a public official which changes everything it changes for instance his divorces it's nobody's business how many divorces a private individual has you know I mean it's like if he's in the White House and getting it on with a an intern in the Oval Office then it becomes our business because we pay for the Oval Office what he does in his offices not my business meanwhile Julian assigns the Wikileak guy says more stuff is coming down the pike on Hillary and he was on with Hannity and he made this really devastating point remember Hillary said that she didn't know she told the FBI she didn't know what the see meant that it meant classified confidential on her emails she signed papers under oath saying she knew about this stuff but apparently she didn't know and Assange says he can't buy it Hillary Clinton says that she can't remember what a C in bracket stands for everyone in positions of government and in WikiLeaks knows it stands for personal confidential and in fact we have already released thousands of cables by Hillary Clinton he is Clinton see that's her signature Clinton with the C in bracket right there are thousands of examples where she herself has used his sealed records and signed it off and more than 22,000 times that she has received cables from others with this C in brackets so it's it's absolutely incredible for Clinton to lie she is lying about not knowing what that is but it's it's disturbing that it's Kony goes along with that game all right we got the mailbag coming up so stay tuned but if you're in facebook or youtube you got to come over to the daily wire and hear the rest
