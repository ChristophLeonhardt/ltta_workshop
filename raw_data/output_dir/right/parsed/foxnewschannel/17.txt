WHIP STEVE SCALISE.
HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW.
MR. SCALISE, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH A WAVE
OF PACKAGES ADDRESSED TO
DEMOCRATS AND PROMINENT CRITICS
OF THE PRESIDENT BEING DELIVERED
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY?
>> WELL, GOOD MORNING.
THIS IS VERY DISTURBING WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING.
I'M VERY FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT, CONFIDENT THEY WILL
FIND OUT WHO EXACTLY DID THIS
THEY WILL FIGURE THIS OUT.
THAT PERSON SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO
JUSTICE AND IT SHOULD BE SWIFT.
FOR NOW MAKE SURE WE'RE CALMING
DOWN THE RHETORIC, NOT POINTING
FINGERS, MY GOODNESS THE WE
SHOULD ENCOURAGE LAW ENFORCEMENT
WITH ALL THE TOOLS THEY NEED.
BRIAN: WHEN SOMEONE ALMOST BLED
TO DEATH WHEN YOU WERE SHOT BY A
BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER AT
SECOND BASE TRYING TO PRACTICE
FOR A SOFTBALL GAME, WHAT DO YOU
WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW WHAT DO
YOU HOPE HAPPENS NEXT 24, 48
HOURS AS WE GO ON AN MASSIVE
HUNT TO FIND OUT WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE?
WHAT WILL BE YOUR FOCUS, STEVE?
>> MY FOCUS IS TO BE CLEAR THERE
IS NO PLACE FOR THIS IN AMERICAN
POLITICS THIS IS HOW THINGS GO
IN THIRD WORLD NATIONS WHERE
PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN GO
THREATEN, BULLY, INTIMIDATE,
TERRORIZE PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR
POLITICAL VIEWS.
THAT IS NOT WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS
ABOUT.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'LL BE
ULTIMATELY B WE'LL FIGURE OUTLAW
ENFORCEMENT WILL FIGURE OUT WHO
DID THIS BUT THERE IS NO PLACE
FOR IT.
AINSLEY: AFTER ALL THE
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES WE STARTED
TO DETERMINE THEY WERE ALL BEING
SENT TO DEMOCRATS PEOPLE WERE ON
NETWORK SHOWS BLAMING THE
PRESIDENT FOR THIS.
JOHN BRENNAN IS EVEN RESPONDING
TO THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET THIS
MORNING SAYING STOP BLAMING
OTHER THE, LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
BLAMING HIM FOR HIS INFLAMMATORY
RHETORIC AN INSULTS AND LIES
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET
VIOLENT.
WE HAD DEMOCRATS THAT ENCOURAGED
PEOPLE TO GET VIOLENT, GET IN
THE FACE OR SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE
ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE.
WHEN YOU HEAR BOTH SIDES HAVING
THESE ARGUMENTS, WHAT GOES
THROUGH YOUR MIND?
BECAUSE YOU WERE TARGETED
BECAUSE YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN.
TODAY THE STORY IS A LITTLE
DIFFERENT IN FACT THAT DEMOCRATS
ARE BEING TARGETED BUT IS YOUR
MESSAGE, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH?
>> IT IS.
LOOK THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY CAN
USE THIS AND TRY TO GO AND HAVE
A PRESS CONFERENCE BLAME
SOMEBODY ELSE THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT, THEY DON'T EVEN
KNOW THE FACTS, THIS IS THE NOT
THE TIME TO POINT FINGERS.
WE NEED TO CALM IT DOWN.
EVERYBODY'S RHETORIC SHOULD BE
FOCUSED ON THE IDEA WE HAVE A
GREAT NATION WE CAN DISAGREE
WITH EACH OTHER, YOU DON'T MAKE
IT PERSONAL, YOU DON'T RESORT TO
ATTACKS.
IF YOU THREATENING SOMEBODY ELSE
YOU PRETTY MUCH LOST THE
ARGUMENT ALREADY.
FOCUS WING DEBATE, IF YOU HAVE
BETTER IDEAS, SHOW THE IDEAS.
WE'LL HAVE AN ELECTION 12 DAYS
ULTIMATELY SETTLE THE POLITICAL
DIFFERENCES.
THAT IS HOW WE SETTLE THEM IN
AMERICA AT THE BALLOT BOX, NOT
THE VIOLENCE.
BRIAN: STEVE, DID YOU BLAME
BERNIE SANDERS FOR YOU BEING
SHOT?
>> NO.
BRIAN: SO WHY DO YOU THINK
EVERYONE IS INTENT ON BLAMING
THE PRESIDENT?
>> YOU KNOW THESE ARE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE HATED EVERYTHING THE
PRESIDENT STOOD FOR.
DONALD TRUMP RAN SOMEBODY LAYING
OUT A VERY SPECIFIC AGENDA FOR
THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN AND HE IS DOING IT.
ALL THE THINGS HE HAS DONE AS
PRESIDENT, HAVE BEEN THINGS HE
PROMISED AND IT IS WORKING.
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THE
FACT OUR ECONOMY IS DOING SO
WELL.
THAT WE'RE FINALLY CHANGING THE
DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY,
GETTING THINGS BACK ON TRACK.
IF SOMEBODY HAS A BETTER IDEA,
BETTER SET OF IDEAS, LET THEM
LAY THAT OUT.
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA.
THEY WANT TO MAKE THIS ABOUT
PERSONALITY, THEY'RE AGAINST
SOMEBODY.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WILL WIN THIS
ELECTION.
I'VE BEEN GETTING ALL AROUND THE
COUNTRY, PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL
THEY LIKE ECONOMIC GROWTH WE'RE
HAVING.
THEY DON'T LIKE TONE OF
POLITICS, WHEN THEY SEE PEOPLE
THREATENING CABINET SECRETARIES,
RUN PEOPLE IT OF RESTAURANTS
BASED ON THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS.
THAT IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS.
THAT WILL NOT WIN THEM THE HOUSE
OR SENATE, WHATEVER ELSE THEY'RE
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH FOR
ELECTION CYCLE.
IT'S A BATTLE OF IDEAS.
I THINK WE HAVE BETTER IDEAS.
WE'RE WORKING FOR PRESIDENT
TRUMP, WORKING FOR FAMILIES THAT
HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN FOR SO LONG.
THEY ARE GLAD SOMEBODY FINALLY
STANDING UP FOR THEM.
AINSLEY: DOES THIS CHANGE THE
WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE, WHEN YOU
GO TO THE MAILBOX OR EVEN
PRACTICING FOR BASEBALL?
>> YOU CAN'T LET IT CHANGE THE
WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE.
IF YOU DO THEN THEY WIN.
SO ULTIMATELY WE'VE GOT TO
CONTINUE TO GO ON WITH OUR LIFE,
BE MORE VIGILANT, PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN REALLY GOOD OVER THE YEARS,
ESPECIALLY SINCE
SEPTEMBER 11th, IF THEY SEE
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS THEY REPORT
IT.
THAT IS WHY YOU'RE SEEING SO
MANY LATEST PACKAGES BEING
REPORTED.
PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
VIGILANT IN AMERICA.
PEOPLE HATE US FOR WHO WE ARE,
WHAT OUR VALUES ARE.
IT MAKES OUR COUNTRY GREAT
BECAUSE WE HAVE GREAT VALUES.
PEOPLE WANT TO MANY COULD TO OUR
COUNTRY TO BE PART OF THE
AMERICAN DREAM.
PEOPLE WANT TO COME TO THE
COUNTRY TO DO US HARM.
WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF BOTH.
STEVE: MR. SCALISE, ONE OF THE
THINGS DOESN'T ADD UP TO THE
ANALYSTS ON THE AIR, EVERYBODY
KNOWS, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,
FORMER PRESIDENTS, DEMOCRATS,
AMERICANS, DON'T NECESSARILY
OPEN THEIR OWN MAIL.
THEY GO TO A CONTAINMENT
FACILITY.
EVERY PIECE OF MAIL IN CONGRESS
IS OPENED OFF SIGHT, OFTEN TIME
IN OTHER STATES.
IF THEY WERE TRYING, TO YOU
KNOW, THE PERSON, BLOW UP THE
PERSON THAT IT WAS ADDRESSED TO,
THAT PERSON DOESN'T OPEN THE
ENVELOPE.
>> WHO KNOWS WHAT THE REAL
MOTIVATION IS, WHAT THEY'RE
REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, BUT
ULTIMATELY WHAT I AM CONFIDENT
OF IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET
CAUGHT.
WHEN THEY GET CAUGHT WE'LL KNOW
A LOT MORE.
RIGHT NOW NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING
ABOUT WHO IS BEHIND THIS.
FOR THEM TO TRY TO GIVE SOME
KIND OF COMMENTARY ABOUT WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, WHEN THEY
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, TRYING TO
ASSIGN BLAME TO SOMEBODY, THAT
IS THE KIND OF POLITICS PEOPLE
REALLY ARE DISGUSTED BY.
THIS IS NOT TIME FOR THAT.
TIME FOR UNIFYING.
NOT CHANGE WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT
AMERICA.
WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN LAW
ENFORCEMENT WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW
WHO DID THIS AND CONTINUE TO
MOVE FORWARD AS THE GREATEST
