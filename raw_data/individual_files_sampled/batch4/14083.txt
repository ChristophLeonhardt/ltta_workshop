if you think letting an American citizen apply for refugee status is a joke after he spits on our border guard if you think taking in convicted us criminals is a bad joke it's slippery though guys well here's the biggest laugh of your day it's from the leading French language newspaper in Quebec published by our friends at Quebec whore it's the Journal of the morale we read it in French for a second and den mom dude that seal though that's why in convocation pour 2030 all right forgive me my friends I won't say any more in French in English that means a demander of asylum receives his hearing summons for the year twenty thirty twenty thirty and he has to come back to court which will then decide if he's a refugee or not spoiler alert he's not but he's allowed just to kick back in Canada on welfare and free housing maybe one of Trudeau's refugee camps in hotels for 12 years let me put the article through Google Translate to save you my painful French this is a machine translation it's not perfect but it's understandable let me read it I'll mop up a little bit of clunky translations but this is accurately when it says says a refugee claimant from Montreal has been summoned to a hearing for his asylum application the date of which has been set in 12 years immigration Stefan Han field was so shocked when he saw letter of invitation from one of his clients that he published part of it on Facebook it states that the claimant must go to the immigration refugee board at complex Keeffe have whole in montreal on January 1st 2030 there is a public servant who sleeps on the switch because on the one hand January 1 is a holiday and on the other hand waiting times for a hearing are 12 to 18 months certainly not 12 years old says hand filled who points out that he may be retired himself in 2030 ha so if this fake refugee actually shows up on January 1st 2030 of course the office can be closed no problem they'll just probably ask him to come back for the next available slot 12 years after that in the year 2042 or maybe his children or grandchildren can come back then and by the way he's lawfully allowed to be in Canada under Trudeau until then now there's your now the Maori all says the whole thing maybe not fake but a deliberate lie told by the Trudeau government let me read this part this is interesting according to the lawyer in addition to the possible error of an immigration refugee and citizen shown Canada officer it could be the January 1st 2030 is in fact a fictitious date a method that the department has used in the past really what has happening for example during the massive arrival of Haitians in 2017 all court dates were set for June 1 2018 of course it was impossible for the court to hear everyone that day but it allowed to enter a date in the system said hand filled so they're not even serious they're not even going to have these hearings is what I'm detecting it's a fake bureaucracy just like we have a fake border with a fake sign saying don't come in the police aren't doing their jobs why should the Immigration and Refugee Board do their jobs the only people who have to do their jobs is you and me because someone's got to do their jobs because someone's got to pay the taxes to pay with these tens of thousands of refugees who will be here forever that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra lavance show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
