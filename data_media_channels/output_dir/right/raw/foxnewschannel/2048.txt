00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:06,975
INTERESTING.

4
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:07,909
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT

5
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:09,177
ENDORSE ONE CANDIDATE.

6
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,812
HE ACTUALLY ENDORSED TWO

HE CALLS A "SHOUT-OUT."

27
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,541
>> WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE

00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,675
MOMENTUM AND WE ARE EXCITED

29
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:42,077
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE US A

00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:55,957
THE HOME STRETCH.

39
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:58,593
WE WILL WIN TOMORROW.

40
00:00:58,593 --> 00:00:59,894
>> BUT BLANKENSHIP TELLS US

41
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,329
THAT HE REJECTS THE

42
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,164
PRESIDENT'S COMPARISON THERE

43
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,933

NOT YOUNG WOMEN.

50
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:17,746
I THINK HE IS GETTING THE

51
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:18,847
WRONG STORY.

52
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:20,382
MITCH McCONNELL DOESN'T WANT

53
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:22,283
ME TO BE IN THE SENATE BECAUSE

54
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,918
HE KNOWS I BELIEVE WE NEED NEW

00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:26,788
SWAMP.

57
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:27,889
>> BLANKENSHIP DID GO TO JAIL

58
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:30,525
FOR A YEAR ON A CONVICTION FOR

59
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,594
CONSPIRING TO VIOLATE MINE

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PATRICK

64
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,836
MORRISEY IS POINTING OUT THAT

65
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:43,938
BLANKENSHIP FILED A FINANCIAL

66
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,173

73
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,318
ISSUE RIGHT AWAY TO DETERMINE

74
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,021
IF THIS REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH

75
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,723
THE FEDERAL LAW VIOLATES THE

76
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:05,126

77
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:05,593

HE ALREADY GAVE THE P.O. A

82
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,202
HEADS UP AND HE LAUGHED AT THE

83
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,737
CHARGE THAT A FINANCIAL

84
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,839
DISCLOSURE NOT YET FILED COULD

85
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,274
POSSIBLY DISQUALIFY HIM OR GET

86
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:19,874
HIM ARRESTED.

87
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,443
HE SAYS THE P.O. COMPARED IT

88
00:02:21,443 --> 00:00:00,000
