Donald Trump is allegedly set to announce the first bundle of emergency relief funds for the hurricane Harvey recovery effort the request would apparently allocate 5.5 billion dollars to FEMA and the rest about five hundred million dollars to the Small Business Administration can't wait to see how that money is divvied out but I'm sure there'll be a rigorous accounting of it let's see and bio this is the numbers big six billion dollars a lot of money obviously but you know these hurricanes do a lot of damage what was astounding to me was what amount of the recovery this actually covers the administration believes the funding six billion dollars would cover recovery demands through the end of the fiscal year on September 30th that's not a year year but one month so one month from now the six billion dollars now obviously as you go further out you will need less money but there will still be a lot of money for months and for years and what's interesting is that Trump is requesting a six billion dollars which I have no idea if that's enough money I'm sure that there will be a rigorous debate about that but it's Paul Ryan's response to that because he does also support recovery funds but listen the way he described what should happen speaker Ryan said lawmakers will replenish a federal disaster relief fund to keep federal aid flowing to hurricane Harvey victims but that full assistance will come from Congress in installments oh boy and look that could just be a way to sort of adapt to the changing circumstance or it could be a way to adapt to people's changing level of attention to the disaster so that in a month or two when people aren't paying as much attention suddenly those installments start to come up a bit dry the new cycle certainly has attention deficit disorder yeah say the least so that's that's my fear is I saw that quote I was like I don't know about that imagine how many more Trump controversies there going to be between the first installment and the second installment but it's time either the second installment they were like hurricane Harvey that was a million new cycles ago given the pace at which hurricane Trump is moving and and you mentioned the Small Business Administration I can't wait to see how Linda McMahon is gonna spend money oh no here comes big man off the top rope anyway but my main point on this is remember Republican projection it's the number one thing they do so I point that out because Ted Cruz said that he killed he voted against it and killed it he voted against superstorm sandy relief because it was laden with pork now that's not true the Washington Post broke it down an earlier version the bill had some pork but that was all eliminated so they gave him a three out of four Pinocchios not true right but what did they accuse the other side of doing the thing that they want to do so I guarantee you the Ted Cruz and other Republicans put so much pork into this bill you you it'll make your head spin right so they'll give money to the chemical factory that exploded which has by the way funds almost all the Texas politicians gives them donations and that's why they killed safety regulations around chemical factory I'm sorry it didn't explode authorities later changed it when they found out that every Republican in Texas takes money from that company - there were pops that caused fires mm-hmm I believe that's called an explosion anyway and and they will give money to ExxonMobil and they'll give money to all the guys who are funding them and by the way other people who have funded Republican legislators in the state of Texas Exxon Mobil Koch brothers and Saudi interests Saudis also have refineries in Texas in fact it's their headquarters in the in North America and so those guys will grease those wheels again and they will probably take more money than the citizens I feel like we should probably stop funding those Saudi oil refineries until we can figure out what the hell is going on yeah we don't know we our country's a problem and we don't know probably anybody ever imagined yeah now it's funny how they seem to have a problem with Muslims coming into the country from certain places but when Muslim money comes in and goes in the pockets of Republican legislators all of a sudden they're not any problem with that at all and I bet you they take some of your money and headed right in that direction in the form of aid for her Jean Harvey wait Muslim extremists from which country were involved in 9/11 Syria no I'm pretty sure was 15 out of 19 more from Saudi Arabia oh yeah that's right hmm but they're not part of the band that's weird they're not strange if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch it without ads if you become a member TYT Network comm / join
