I encountered and I'm aware of information intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and US persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn though such individuals and it raised questions in my mind again whether or not the Russians were able to gain the cooperation of those individuals I don't know whether or not such collusion that's your term such collusion existed I don't know but I know that there was a sufficient basis of information and intelligence that required further investigation by the bureau to determine whether or not US persons were actively conspiring colluding with Russian officials
