MESA, ARIZONA. WILLIAM? DANA, THE BOMB SHELL HERE TODAY ARE THESE TWO VIDEOS THAT SURFACED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS WITH CONGRESS WOMAN SINEMA THAT PORTRAYS HERSELF AS A MODERATE AND DOESN'T CALL HER SELF-A DEMOCRAT AND MOCKING THE GOP AND THE STATE WHEN SHE WAS A STATE SENATOR. MY STATE IS CLEARLY THE METH LAB OF DEMOCRACY. IN ANOTHER VIDEO, SHE ACTUALLY REFERS TO REPUBLICANS AS CRAZY. THE REPUBLICANS ARE ALL THE SAME THING. THEY'RE CRAZY. SO THE RACE NOW IS A VIRTUAL DEAD HEAT. THE GOP ANGER OVER THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS HELPED McSALLY TO CLOSE THE GAP. EARLY VOTING BEGAN WEDNESDAY. 80% WILL CAST THEIR VOTES BEFORE ELECTION DAY. NOW, ARIZONA HAS NOT ELECTED A DEMOCRAT TO THE SENATE SINCE 1988. SO WHY IS IT SO CLOSE? DEMOGRAPHICS. A THIRD IS REPUBLICAN, A THIRD INDEPENDENT, A THIRD DEMOCRAT. HISPANICS NOW 25% OF THE VOTE. BOTH ARE WOMEN. THERE'S NO GENDER BIAS AND MONEY. SINEMA HAS PRO CHOICE GROUPS AND OUTSIDE MONEY KEEPING HER ON THE AIR. ON POLICY, THEY DIFFER ON GUN CONTROL, OBAMACARE, ABORTION AND THE BORDER WALL. ATTACK ADS, SINEMA IS PORTRAYING McSALLY AS A LIAR AND HYPOCRITE AND SHE SUPPORTS PRESIDENT TRUMP. McSALLY PORTRAYS SINEMA AS BASICALLY A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT, MASQUERADING AS A MODERATE. WHILE WE WERE IN HARM'S WAY IN UNIFORM, SINEMA WAS PROTESTING US IN A PINK TUTU.
