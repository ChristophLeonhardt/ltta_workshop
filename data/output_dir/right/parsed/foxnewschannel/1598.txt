AS WELL AS VICTIMS OF A NOVEMBER
MASS SHOOTING AT A CHURCH IN THE
TOWN OF SUTHERLAND SPRINGS.
THE U.S. IS CALLING YESTERDAY'S
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN
VENEZUELA A SHAM.
IT IS TURNING UP THE HEAT ON A
GOVERNMENT IT CONSIDERS
ILLEGITIMATE.
CORRESPONDENT PHIL KEATING HAS
REACTION TONIGHT FROM MIAMI.
GOOD EVENING.
>> GOOD EVENING, BRET.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NEW EXECUTIVE
ORDER ON VENEZUELA SPECIFICALLY
TARGETS WHAT IT CALLS A
KLEPTOCRACY ON A SCALE NOT SEEN
IN LATIN AMERICA.
ACCUSING THE SOCIALIST REGIMES
LEADER OF STEALING UP TO 70% OF
HUMANITARIAN FUNDS FOR THEIR OWN
POCKETS AND USING FOOD AS A
WEAPON AGAINST THE VENEZUELAN
PEOPLE.
IT SPECIFICALLY BANS ANY
AMERICAN FROM PURCHASING
VENEZUELA DEBT OR STATE OWNED
ASSETS.
PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO
CELEBRATED REELECTION LAST NIGHT
IN CARACAS AFTER AN ELECTION
BOYCOTTED BY THE OPPOSITION
WHERE FEWER THAN 20% VOTED.
EVEN BEFORE THE VOTE, THE
UNITED STATES, EUROPEAN UNION,
AND MANY LATIN AMERICAN
NEIGHBORS SAID THEY WOULDN'T
RECOGNIZED RESULTS IN THAT IT
WAS RIGGED FROM THE START.
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE SAID
VENEZUELA'S ELECTION WASN'T
SHAM.
NEITHER FREE NOR FAIR.
EVERY DAY THOUSANDS OF
VENEZUELANS FULLY BRUTAL
OPPRESSION AND GRINDING POVERTY,
LITERALLY VOTING WITH THEIR
FEET.
AMERICA STANDS AGAINST
DICTATORSHIP AND WITH THE PEOPLE
OF VENEZUELA.
UP TO 1.5 MILLION VENEZUELANS
HAVE FLED THEIR COUNTRY, LOOKING
FOR FOOD, MEDICINE, AND HOPE.
REPORTS SUGGEST THE AVERAGE
VENEZUELAN HAS LOST ABOUT
25 POUNDS OVER THE PAST TWO
YEARS.
IN AN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
TODAY SAYS THE EXODUS IS ON A
SYRIAN SCALE, A TRUE CATASTROPHE
IN THE REGION.
ADDING THAT THE VENEZUELAN
ECONOMY HAS IMPLODED SO
SEVERELY, THE REGIME'S ELITES
ARE RUNNING OUT OF SOURCES TO
STEAL.
THEY ARE LIQUIDATING STATE
ASSETS AND SELLING OFF FUTURE
DEBT PAYMENT FOR PENNIES ON THE
DOLLAR TODAY.
ON FRIDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME,
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCUSED
PRESIDENT MADURO OF PERSONALLY
PROFITING FROM NARCO
TRAFFICKING.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
STILL WITHHOLDING THE
POSSIBILITY OF DEVASTATING OIL
SANCTIONS AGAINST VENEZUELA.
IT WOULD FURTHER CRIPPLE AN
ECONOMY WHERE INFLATION RIGHT
NOW IS 13000%.
