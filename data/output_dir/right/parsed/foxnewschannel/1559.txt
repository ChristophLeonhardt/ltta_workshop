MEETING MIGHT NOT HAPPEN IN JUN
JUNE.
>> Lawrence: WE SHOULD HAVE
ASSUMED THAT WHEN THESE
CONVERSATIONS FIRST STARTED,
LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE SHOW, KIM IS SO
UNPREDICTABLE.
BUT AGAIN, THIS IS SUCH A FLUID
SITUATION.
THIS IS WHY PART OF MY PROBLEM
IS THAT I HATE THAT WE ARE
HAVING THIS NEGOTIATION BETWEEN
DONALD TRUMP, KIM JONG UN, AND
THE PRESS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO
MANY MOVING PARTS AND THIS BACK
AND FORTH.
>> Harris: THERE’S ALSO
PROPAGANDA.
I DON’T MISS IT.
KIM JONG UN WAITED UNTIL THE
DATE WAS SET AND THE LOCATION
WAS SET FOR HIM TO SAY MAYBE I’M
NOT GOING TO CELEBRATE
DISMANTLING AND MAYBE I’M NOT
GOING TO DENUCLEARIZE AND YOU
CAN’T TELL ME THAT THAT MAN
DOESN’T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE
MEETING OF THAT WORD IS.
>> Sandra: WHILE HE REFUSES TO
SAY WHETHER THERE ARE CONDITIONS
FOR THIS NORTH KOREAN MEETING,
AND AS I SAID, HE WOULD LIKE THE
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE
PENINSULA TO BE "ALL IN ONE," HE
CANNOT GUARANTEE KIM’S SAFETY.
HE CAN GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL
BE RICH.
IF IT WORKS OUT.
>> Katie: SO THEY ARE TRYING
TO REASSURE KIM JONG UN THAT HE
WILL BE ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS
REGIME EVEN IF THEY
DENUCLEARIZING BECAUSE HIS
ENTIRE PREMISE OF HIS OWN
NEGOTIATION REQUIRE THAT HE KEEP
HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH THE
ABILITY TO PRESERVE HIS REGIME.
AND HE HAS LOOKED AT THINGS THAT
HAVE HAPPENED AROUND THE WORLD
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS.
JOHN BOLTON’S COMMENTS ABOUT
THAT, MADE IT HIDDEN TAKE A
SECOND LOOK AT THAT AND THE
PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO REASSURE
